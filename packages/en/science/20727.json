Merlin meant everything to them: power, pleasures, and\r\nprofits unlimited.\r\n\r\nConn had known they'd never believe him, and so he had a trick or two\r\nup his space-trained sleeve that might outwit even their fabled Cosmic\r\nComputer ... if they dared accept his challenge.\r\n\r\n_H.

It may be stated that he lives in Williamsport,\r\nPennsylvania, that he is an expert on the history and use of hand\r\nweapons, that he has been writing and selling science-fiction for many\r\nyears to the leading magazines, and that he is highly rated among\r\nreaders for his skill and imagination. He has had several novels\r\npublished, including mysteries and juveniles.\r\n\r\nHis previous appearances in Ace Books include two novels written in\r\ncollaboration with John J.

Beam Piper\r\n\r\n\r\nAn Ace Book, by arrangement with G. P. Putnam's Sons\r\n\r\n\r\nAll Rights Reserved\r\n\r\n\r\nPrinted in U.S.A.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\n\r\nThirty minutes to Litchfield.\r\n\r\nConn Maxwell, at the armor-glass front of the observation deck,\r\nwatched the landscape rush out of the horizon and vanish beneath the\r\nship, ten thousand feet down. He thought he knew how an hourglass must\r\nfeel with the sand slowly draining out.\r\n\r\nIt had been six months to Litchfield when the _Mizar_ lifted out of La\r\nPlata Spaceport and he watched Terra dwindle away. It had been two\r\nmonths to Litchfield when he boarded the _City of Asgard_ at the port\r\nof the same name on Odin. It had been two hours to Litchfield when the\r\n_Countess Dorothy_ rose from the airship dock at Storisende. He had\r\nhad all that time, and now it was gone, and he was still unprepared\r\nfor what he must face at home.\r\n\r\nThirty minutes to Litchfield.\r\n\r\nThe words echoed in his mind as though he had spoken them aloud, and\r\nthen, realizing that he never addressed himself as sir, he turned. It\r\nwas the first mate.\r\n\r\nHe had a clipboard in his hand, and he was wearing a Terran Federation\r\nSpace Navy uniform of forty years, or about a dozen regulation-changes,\r\nago. Once Conn had taken that sort of thing for granted. Now it was\r\nobtruding upon him everywhere.\r\n\r\n\"Thirty minutes to Litchfield, sir,\" the first officer repeated, and\r\ngave him the clipboard to check the luggage list. Valises, two;\r\ntrunks, two; microbook case, one. The last item fanned a small flicker\r\nof anger, not at any person, not even at himself, but at the whole\r\ninfernal situation. He nodded.\r\n\r\n\"That's everything. Not many passengers left aboard, are there?\"\r\n\r\n\"You're the only one, first class, sir. About forty farm laborers on\r\nthe lower deck.\" He dismissed them as mere cargo. \"Litchfield's the\r\nend of the run.\"\r\n\r\n\"I know. I was born there.\"\r\n\r\nThe mate looked again at his name on the list and grinned.\r\n\r\n\"Sure; you're Rodney Maxwell's son. Your father's been giving us a lot\r\nof freight lately. I guess I don't have to tell you about Litchfield.\"\r\n\r\n\"Maybe you do. I've been away for six years. Tell me, are they having\r\nlabor trouble now?\"\r\n\r\n\"Labor trouble?\" The mate was surprised. \"You mean with the\r\nfarm-tramps? Ten of them for every job, if you call that trouble.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I noticed you have steel gratings over the gangway heads to the\r\nlower deck, and all your crewmen are armed. Not just pistols, either.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh. That's on account of pirates.\"\r\n\r\n\"Pirates?\" Conn echoed.\r\n\r\n\"Well, I guess you'd call them that. A gang'll come aboard, dressed\r\nlike farm-tramps; they'll have tommy guns and sawed-off shotguns in\r\ntheir bindles. When the ship's airborne and out of reach of help,\r\nthey'll break out their guns and take her. Usually kill all the crew\r\nand passengers. They don't like to leave live witnesses,\" the mate\r\nsaid. \"You heard about the _Harriet Barne_, didn't you?\"\r\n\r\nShe was Transcontinent & Overseas, the biggest contragravity ship on\r\nthe planet.\r\n\r\n\"They didn't pirate her, did they?\"\r\n\r\nThe mate nodded. \"Six months ago; Blackie Perales' gang. There was\r\njust a tag end of a radio call, that ended in a shot. Time the Air\r\nPatrol got to her estimated position it was too late. Nobody's ever\r\nseen ship, officers, crew or passengers since.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, great Ghu; isn't the Government doing anything about it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Sure. They offered a big reward for the pirates, dead or alive. And\r\nthere hasn't been a single case of piracy inside the city limits of\r\nStorisende,\" he added solemnly.\r\n\r\nThe Calder Range had grown to a sharp blue line on the horizon ahead,\r\nand he could see the late afternoon sun on granite peaks. Below, the\r\nfields were bare and brown, and the woods were autumn-tinted. They had\r\nbeen green with new foliage when he had last seen them, and the\r\nwine-melon fields had been in pink blossom. Must have gotten the crop\r\nin early, on this side of the mountains. Maybe they were still\r\nharvesting, over in the Gordon Valley. Or maybe this gang below was\r\ngoing to the wine-pressing. Now that he thought of it, he'd seen a lot\r\nof cask staves going aboard at Storisende.\r\n\r\nYet there seemed to be less land under cultivation now than six years\r\nago. He could see squares of bracken and low brush that had been melon\r\nfields recently, among the new forests that had grown up in the past\r\nforty years. The few stands of original timber towered above the\r\nsecond growth like hills; those trees had been there when the planet\r\nhad been colonized.\r\n\r\nThat had been two hundred years ago, at the beginning of the Seventh\r\nCentury, Atomic Era. The name \"Poictesme\" told that--Surromanticist\r\nMovement, when they were rediscovering James Branch Cabell. Old Genji\r\nGartner, the scholarly and half-piratical space-rover whose ship had\r\nbeen the first to enter the Trisystem, had been devoted to the\r\nromantic writers of the Pre-Atomic Era. He had named all the planets\r\nof the Alpha System from the books of Cabell, and those of Beta from\r\nSpenser's _Faerie Queene_, and those of Gamma from Rabelais. Of\r\ncourse, the camp village at his first landing site on this one had\r\nbeen called Storisende.\r\n\r\nThirty years later, Genji Gartner had died there, after seeing\r\nStorisende grow to a metropolis and Poictesme become a Member Republic\r\nin the Terran Federation. The other planets were uninhabitable except\r\nin airtight dome cities, but they were rich in minerals. Companies had\r\nbeen formed to exploit them. No food could be produced on any of them\r\nexcept by carniculture and hydroponic farming, and it had been cheaper\r\nto produce it naturally on Poictesme. So Poictesme had concentrated on\r\nagriculture and had prospered. At least, for about a century.\r\n\r\nOther colonial planets were developing their own industries; the\r\nmanufactured goods the Gartner Trisystem produced could no longer find\r\na profitable market. The mines and factories on Jurgen and Koshchei,\r\non Britomart and Calidore, on Panurge and the moons of Pantagruel\r\nclosed, and the factory workers went away. On Poictesme, the offices\r\nemptied, the farms contracted, forests reclaimed fields, and the wild\r\ngame came back.\r\n\r\nComing toward the ship out of the east, now, was a vast desert of\r\ncrumbling concrete--landing fields and parade grounds, empty barracks\r\nand toppling sheds, airship docks, stripped gun emplacements and\r\nmissile-launching sites. These were more recent, and dated from\r\nPoictesme's second hectic prosperity, when the Gartner Trisystem had\r\nbeen the advance base for the Third Fleet-Army Force, during the\r\nSystem States War.\r\n\r\nIt had lasted twelve years. Millions of troops were stationed on or\r\nrouted through Poictesme. The mines and factories reopened for war\r\nproduction. The Federation spent trillions on trillions of sols, piled\r\nup mountains of supplies and equipment, left the face of the world\r\ncluttered with installations. Then, without warning, the System States\r\nAlliance collapsed, the rebellion ended, and the scourge of peace fell\r\non Poictesme.\r\n\r\nThe Federation armies departed. They took the clothes they stood in,\r\ntheir personal weapons, and a few souvenirs. Everything else was\r\nabandoned. Even the most expensive equipment had been worth less than\r\nthe cost of removal.\r\n\r\nThe people who had grown richest out of the War had followed, taking\r\ntheir riches with them. For the next forty years, those who remained\r\nhad been living on leavings. On Terra, Conn had told his friends that\r\nhis father was a prospector, leaving them to interpret that as one who\r\nsearched, say, for uranium. Rodney Maxwell found quite a bit of\r\nuranium, but he got it by taking apart the warheads of missiles.\r\n\r\nNow he was looking down on the granite spines of the Calder Range;\r\nahead the misty Gordon Valley sloped and widened to the north. Twenty\r\nminutes to Litchfield, now. He still didn't know what he was going to\r\ntell the people who would be waiting for him. No; he knew that; he\r\njust didn't know how. The ship swept on, ten miles a minute, tearing\r\nthrough thin puffs of cloud. Ten minutes. The Big Bend was glistening\r\nredly in the sunlit haze, but Litchfield was still hidden inside its\r\ncurve. Six. Four. The _Countess Dorothy_ was losing speed and\r\naltitude. Now he could see it, first a blur and then distinctly. The\r\nAirlines Building, so thick as to look squat for all its height. The\r\nyellow block of the distilleries under their plume of steam. High\r\nGarden Terrace; the Mall.\r\n\r\nMoment by moment, the stigmata of decay became more evident. Terraces\r\nempty or littered with rubbish; gardens untended and choked with wild\r\ngrowth; blank-staring windows, walls splotched with lichens. At first,\r\nhe was horrified at what had happened to Litchfield in six years. Then\r\nhe realized that the change had been in himself. He was seeing it with\r\nnew eyes, as it really was.\r\n\r\nThe ship came in five hundred feet above the Mall, and he could see\r\ncracked pavements sprouting grass, statues askew on their pedestals,\r\nwaterless fountains. At first he thought one of them was playing, but\r\nwhat he had taken for spray was dust blowing from the empty basin.\r\nThere was a thing about dusty fountains, some poem he'd read at the\r\nUniversity.\r\n\r\n_The fountains are dusty in the Graveyard of Dreams;\r\nThe hinges are rusty, they swing with tiny screams._\r\n\r\nWas Poictesme a Graveyard of Dreams? No; Junkyard of Empire. The\r\nTerran Federation had impoverished a hundred planets, devastated a\r\nscore, actually depopulated at least three, to keep the System States\r\nAlliance from seceding. It hadn't been a victory. It had only been a\r\nlesser defeat.\r\n\r\nThere was a crowd, almost a mob, on the dock; nearly everybody in\r\ntopside Litchfield. He spotted old Colonel Zareff, with his white hair\r\nand plum-brown skin, and Tom Brangwyn, the town marshal, red-faced and\r\nbulking above everybody else. Kurt Fawzi, the mayor, well to the\r\nfront. Then he saw his father and mother, and his sister Flora, and\r\nwaved to them. They waved back, and then everybody was waving. The\r\ngangway-port opened, and the Academy band struck up, enthusiastically\r\nif inexpertly, as he descended to the dock.\r\n\r\nHis father was wearing a black suit with a long coat, cut to the same\r\npattern as the one he had worn six years ago. Blackout curtain cloth.\r\nIt was fairly new, but the coat had begun to acquire a permanent\r\nwrinkle across the right hip, over the pistol butt. His mother's dress\r\nwas new, and so was Flora's, made for the occasion. He couldn't be\r\nsure just which of the Federation Armed Forces had provided the\r\nmaterial, but his father's shirt was Med Service sterilon.\r\n\r\nAshamed to be noticing things like that, he clasped his father's hand,\r\nkissed his mother, embraced his sister. There were a few, but very\r\nfew, gray threads in his father's mustache; a few more squint-wrinkles\r\naround the eyes. His mother's hair was all gray, now, and she was\r\nheavier. She seemed shorter, but that would be because he'd grown a\r\nfew inches in the last six years. For a moment, he was surprised that\r\nFlora actually looked younger. Then he realized that to seventeen,\r\ntwenty-three is practically middle age, but to twenty-three,\r\ntwenty-nine is almost contemporary. He noticed the glint on her left\r\nhand and caught it to look at the ring.\r\n\r\n\"Hey! Zarathustra sunstone! Nice,\" he said. \"Where is he, Sis?\"\r\n\r\nHe'd never met her fiance; Wade Lucas hadn't come to Litchfield to\r\npractice medicine until the year after he'd gone to Terra.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, emergency,\" Flora said. \"Obstetrical case; that won't wait on\r\nanything. In Tramptown, of course. But he'll be at the party.... Oops,\r\nI shouldn't have said that; that's supposed to be a surprise.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't worry; I'll be surprised,\" he promised.\r\n\r\nThen Kurt Fawzi was pushing forward, holding out his hand. Thinner,\r\nand grayer, but just as effusive as ever.\r\n\r\n\"Welcome home, Conn. Judge, shake hands with him and tell him how glad\r\nwe all are to see him back.... Now, Franz, put away the recorder; save\r\nthe interview for the _Chronicle_ till later. Ah, Professor Kellton;\r\none pupil Litchfield Academy can be proud of!\"\r\n\r\nHe shook hands with them: Judge Ledue, Franz Veltrin, old Professor\r\nDolf Kellton. They were all happy; how much, he wondered, because he\r\nwas Conn Maxwell, Rodney Maxwell's son, home from Terra, and how much\r\nbecause of what they hoped he'd tell them. Kurt Fawzi, edging him\r\naside, was the first to speak of it.\r\n\r\n\"Conn, what did you find out?\" he whispered. \"Do you know where it\r\nis?\"\r\n\r\nHe stammered, then saw Tom Brangwyn and Colonel Klem Zareff\r\napproaching, the older man tottering on a silver-headed cane and the\r\nyounger keeping pace with him. Neither of them had been born on\r\nPoictesme. Tom Brangwyn had always been reticent about where he came\r\nfrom, but Hathor was a good guess. There had been political trouble on\r\nHathor twenty years ago; the losers had had to get off-planet in a\r\nhurry to dodge firing squads. Klem Zareff never was reticent about his\r\npast. He came from Ashmodai, one of the System States planets, and he\r\nhad commanded a regiment, and finally a division that had been blasted\r\ndown to less than regimental strength, in the Alliance Army. He always\r\nwore a little rosette of System States black and green on his coat.\r\n\r\n\"Hello, boy,\" he croaked, extending a hand. \"Good to see you again.\"\r\n\r\n\"It sure is, Conn,\" the town marshal agreed, then lowered his voice.\r\n\"Find out anything definite?\"\r\n\r\n\"We didn't have much time, Conn,\" Kurt Fawzi said, \"but we've\r\narranged a little celebration for you. We'll start it with a dinner at\r\nSenta's.\"\r\n\r\n\"You couldn't have done anything I'd have liked better, Mr. Fawzi. I'd\r\nhave to have a meal at Senta's before I'd really feel at home.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, it'll be a couple of hours. Suppose we all go up to my office,\r\nin the meantime. Give the ladies a chance to fix up for the party, and\r\nhave a little drink and a talk together.\"\r\n\r\n\"You want to do that, Conn?\" his father asked. There was an odd\r\nundernote of anxiety, or reluctance, in his voice.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, of course. I'd like that.\"\r\n\r\nHis father turned to speak to his mother and Flora. Kurt Fawzi was\r\nspeaking to his wife, interrupting himself to shout instructions to\r\nsome laborers who were bringing up a contragravity skid. Conn turned\r\nto Colonel Zareff.\r\n\r\n\"Good melon crop this year?\" he asked.\r\n\r\nThe old Rebel cursed. \"Gehenna of a big crop; we're up to our necks in\r\nmelons. This time next year we'll be washing our feet in brandy.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hold onto it and age it; you ought to see what they charge for a\r\ndrink of Poictesme brandy on Terra.\"\r\n\r\n\"This isn't Terra, and we aren't selling it by the drink,\" Colonel\r\nZareff said. \"We're selling it at Storisende Spaceport, for what the\r\nfreighter captains pay us. You've been away too long, Conn. You've\r\nforgotten what it's like to live in a poor-house.\"\r\n\r\nThe cargo was coming off, now. Cask staves, and more cask staves.\r\nZareff swore bitterly at the sight, and then they started toward the\r\nwide doors of the shipping floor, inside the Airlines Building.\r\nOutgoing cargo was beginning to come out; casks of brandy, of course,\r\nand a lot of boxes and crates, painted light blue and bearing the\r\nyellow trefoil of the Third Fleet-Army Force and the eight-pointed red\r\nstar of Ordnance. Cases of rifles; square boxes of ammunition; crated\r\nauto-cannon. Conn turned to his father.\r\n\r\n\"This our stuff?\" he asked. \"Where did you dig it?\"\r\n\r\nRodney Maxwell laughed. \"You know the old Tenth Army Headquarters,\r\nover back of Snagtooth, in the Calders? Everybody knows that was\r\ncleaned out years ago. Well, always take a second look at these\r\nthings everybody knows. Ten to one they're not so. It always bothered\r\nme that nobody found any underground attack-shelters. I took a second\r\nlook, and sure enough, I found them, right underneath, mined out of\r\nthe solid rock. Conn, you'd be surprised at what I found there.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where are you going to sell that stuff?\" he asked, pointing at a\r\npassing skid. \"There's enough combat equipment around now to outfit a\r\nprivate army for every man, woman and child in Poictesme.\"\r\n\r\n\"Storisende Spaceport. The freighter captains buy it, and sell it on\r\nsome of the planets that were colonized right before the War and\r\nhaven't gotten industrialized yet. I'm clearing about two hundred sols\r\na ton on it.\"\r\n\r\nThe skid at which he had pointed was loaded with cases of M504\r\nsubmachine guns. Even used, one was worth fifty sols. Allowing for\r\npacking weight, his father was selling those tommy guns for less than\r\na good cafe on Terra got for one drink of Poictesme brandy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\n\r\nHe had been in Kurt Fawzi's office before, once or twice, with his\r\nfather; he remembered it as a dim, quiet place of genteel conviviality\r\nand rambling conversation. None of the lights were bright, and the\r\nwalls were almost invisible in the shadows. As they entered, Tom\r\nBrangwyn went to the long table and took off his belt and holster,\r\nlaying it down. One by one, the others unbuckled their weapons and\r\nadded them to the pile. Klem Zareff's cane went on the table with his\r\npistol; there was a sword inside it.\r\n\r\nThat was something else he was seeing with new eyes. He hadn't started\r\ncarrying a gun when he had left for Terra, and he was wondering, now,\r\nwhy any of them bothered to. Why, there wouldn't be a shooting a year\r\nin Litchfield, if you didn't count the Tramptowners, and they stayed\r\nsouth of the docks and off the top level.\r\n\r\nOr perhaps that was just it. Litchfield was peaceful because\r\neverybody was prepared to keep it that way. It certainly wasn't\r\nbecause of anything the Planetary Government did to maintain order.\r\n\r\nNow Brangwyn was setting out glasses, filling a pitcher from a keg in\r\nthe corner of the room. The last time Conn had been here, they'd given\r\nhim a glass of wine, and he'd felt very grown-up because they didn't\r\nwater it for him.\r\n\r\n\"Well, gentlemen,\" Kurt Fawzi was saying, \"let's have a toast to our\r\nreturned friend and new associate. Conn, we're all anxious to hear\r\nwhat you've found out, but even if you didn't learn anything, we're\r\nstill happy to have you back with us. Gentlemen; to our friend and\r\nneighbor. Welcome home, Conn!\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, it's wonderful to be back, Mr. Fawzi,\" he began.\r\n\r\n\"Here, none of this mister foolishness; you're one of us, now, Conn.\r\nAnd drink up, everybody. We have plenty of brandy, if we don't have\r\nanything else.\"\r\n\r\n\"You can say that again, Kurt.\" That was one of the distillery people;\r\nhe'd remember the name in a moment. \"When this new crop gets pressed\r\nand fermented....\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know where in Gehenna I'm going to vat mine till it\r\nferments,\" Klem Zareff said.\r\n\r\n\"Or why,\" another planter added. \"Lorenzo, what are you going to be\r\npaying for wine?\"\r\n\r\nLorenzo Menardes; that was the name. The distiller said he was\r\nworrying about what he'd be able to get for brandy.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, please,\" Fawzi interrupted. \"Not today; not when our boy's home\r\nand is going to tell us how we can solve all our problems.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Conn.\" That was Morgan Gatworth, the lawyer. \"You did find out\r\nwhere Merlin is, didn't you?\"\r\n\r\nThat set them all off. He was still holding his drink; he downed it in\r\none gulp, barely tasting it, and handed the glass to Tom Brangwyn for\r\na refill, and caught a frown on his father's face. One did not gulp\r\ndrinks in Kurt Fawzi's office.\r\n\r\nWell, neither did one blast everybody's hopes with half a dozen words,\r\nand that was what he was trying to force himself to do. He wanted to\r\nblurt out the one quick sentence and get it over with, but the words\r\nwouldn't come out of his throat. He lowered the second drink by half;\r\nthe brandy was beginning to warm him and dissolve the cold lump in his\r\nstomach. Have to go easy, though. He wasn't used to this kind of\r\ndrinking, and he wanted to stay sober enough to talk sense until he'd\r\ntold them what he had to.\r\n\r\n\"I hope,\" he said, \"that you don't expect me to show you the cross on\r\nthe map, where the computer is buried.\"\r\n\r\nAll the eyes around him began to look troubled. Most of them had been\r\nexpecting precisely that. His father was watching him anxiously.\r\n\r\n\"But it's still here on Poictesme, isn't it?\" one of the melon\r\nplanters asked. \"They didn't take it away with them?\"\r\n\r\n\"Most of you gentlemen,\" he said, \"contributed to sending me to school\r\non Terra, to study cybernetics and computer theory. It wouldn't do us\r\nany good to find Merlin if none of us could operate it. Well, I've\r\ndone that. I can use any known type of computer, and train assistants.\r\nAfter I graduated, I was offered a junior instructorship to computer\r\nphysics at the University.\"\r\n\r\n\"You didn't mention that, son,\" his father said.\r\n\r\n\"The letter would have come on the same ship I did. Besides, I didn't\r\nthink it was very important.\"\r\n\r\n\"I think it is.\" There was a catch in old Dolf Kellton's voice. \"One\r\nof my boys from the Academy offered a place on the faculty of the\r\nUniversity of Montevideo, on Terra!\" He finished his drink and held\r\nout his glass for more, something he almost never did.\r\n\r\n\"Conn means,\" Kurt Fawzi explained, \"that it had nothing to do with\r\nMerlin.\"\r\n\r\nAll right; now tell them the truth.\r\n\r\n\"I was also to find out anything I could about a secret giant computer\r\nused during the War by the Third Fleet-Army Force, code-named Merlin.\r\nI went over all the records available to the public; I used your\r\nletter, Professor, and the head of our Modern History department\r\nsecured me access to non-public material, some of it still classified.\r\nFor one thing, I have locations and maps and plans of every Federation\r\ninstallation built here between 842 and 854, the whole period of the\r\nWar.\" He turned to his father. \"There are incredible things still\r\nundiscovered; most of the important installations were built in\r\nduplicate, sometimes triplicate, as a precaution against space attack.\r\nI know where all of them are.\"\r\n\r\n\"Space attack!\" Klem Zareff was indignant. \"There never was a time we\r\ncould have attacked Poictesme. Even if we'd had the ships, we were\r\nfighting a purely defensive war. Aggression was no part of our\r\npolicy--\"\r\n\r\nHe interrupted: \"Excuse me, Colonel. The point I was trying to make is\r\nthat, with all I was able to learn, I could find nothing, not one\r\nsingle word, about any giant strategic planning computer called\r\nMerlin, or any Merlin Project.\"\r\n\r\nThere! He'd gotten that out. Now go on and tell them about the old man\r\nin the dome-house on Luna. The room was silent, except for the small\r\ninsectile hum of the electric clock. Then somebody set a glass on the\r\ntable, and it sounded like a hammer blow.\r\n\r\n\"Nothing, Conn?\"\r\n\r\nKurt Fawzi was incredulous. Judge Ledue's hand shook as though palsied\r\nas he tried to relight his cigar. Dolf Kellton was looking at the\r\ndrink in his hand as though he had no idea what it was. The others\r\nfound their voices, one by one.\r\n\r\n\"Of course, it was the most closely guarded secret ...\"\r\n\r\n\"But after forty years ...\"\r\n\r\n\"Hah, don't tell me about security!\" Colonel Zareff barked. \"You\r\nshould have seen the lengths our staff went to. I remember, once, on\r\nMephistopheles ...\"\r\n\r\n\"But there _was_ a computer code-named Merlin,\" Judge Ledue was\r\ninsisting, to convince himself more than anybody else. \"Its\r\nmemory-bank contained all human knowledge. It was capable of scanning\r\nall its data instantaneously, and combining, and forming associations,\r\nand reasoning with absolute accuracy, and extrapolating to produce new\r\nfacts, and predicting future events, and ...\"\r\n\r\nAnd if you'd asked such a computer, \"Is there a God?\" it would have\r\nsimply answered, \"Present.\"\r\n\r\n\"We'd have won the War, except for Merlin,\" Zareff was declaring.\r\n\r\n\"Conn, from what you've learned of computers generally, how big would\r\nMerlin have to be?\" old Professor Kellton asked.\r\n\r\n\"Well, the astrophysics computer at the University occupied a volume\r\nof a hundred thousand cubic feet. For all Merlin was supposed to do,\r\nI'd say something of the order of three million to five million.\r\n\r\n\"Well, it's a cinch they didn't haul that away with them,\" Lester\r\nDawes, the banker, said.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, lots of places on Poictesme where they could have hid a thing\r\nlike that,\" Tom Brangwyn said. \"You know, a planet's a mighty big\r\nplace.\"\r\n\r\n\"It doesn't have to be on Poictesme, even,\" Morgan Gatworth pointed\r\nout. \"It could be anywhere in the Trisystem.\"\r\n\r\n\"You know where I'd have put it?\" Lorenzo Menardes asked. \"On one of\r\nthe moons of Pantagruel.\"\r\n\r\n\"But that's in the Gamma System, three light years away,\" Kurt Fawzi\r\nobjected. \"There isn't a hypership on this planet, and it would take\r\nhalf a lifetime to get there on normal-space drive.\"\r\n\r\nConn was lifting his glass to his lips. He set it down again and rose\r\nto his feet.\r\n\r\n\"Then,\" he said, \"we will build a hypership. On Koshchei there are\r\nshipyards and hyperdrive engines and everything we will need. We only\r\nneed one normal-space interplanetary ship to get out there, and we're\r\nin business.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I don't know we need one,\" Judge Ledue said. \"That was only an\r\nidea of Lorenzo's. I think Merlin's right here on Poictesme.\"\r\n\r\n\"We don't know it is,\" Conn replied. \"And we don't know we won't need\r\na ship. Merlin may be on Koshchei; that's where the components would\r\nbe fabricated, and the Armed Forces weren't hauling anything any\r\nfarther than they had to. Koshchei's only two and a half minutes away\r\nby radio; that's practically in the next room. Look; here's how they\r\ncould have done it.\"\r\n\r\nHe went on talking, about remote controls and radio transmission and\r\npositronic brains and neutrino-circuits. They believed it all, even\r\nthe little they understood. They would believe anything he told them\r\nabout Merlin--except the truth.\r\n\r\n\"But this will take money,\" Lester Dawes said. \"And after that\r\ninfernal deluge of unsecured paper currency thirty years ago ...\"\r\n\r\n\"I have no doubt,\" Judge Ledue began, \"that the Planetary Government\r\nat Storisende would give assistance. I have some slight influence with\r\nPresident Vyckhoven ...\"\r\n\r\n\"Huh-_uh_!\" That was one of Klem Zareff's fellow planters. \"We don't\r\nwant Jake Vyckhoven or any of this First-Families-of-Storisende\r\noligarchy in this at all. That's the gang that bankrupted the\r\nGovernment with doles and work relief, and everybody else with\r\nworthless printing-press money after the War, and they've been\r\nsquatting in a circle deploring things ever since. Some of these days\r\nBlackie Perales and his pirates'll sack Storisende, for all they'd be\r\nable to do to stop him.\"\r\n\r\n\"We get a ship out to Koshchei, and the next thing you know we'll be\r\nthe Planetary Government,\" Tom Brangwyn said.\r\n\r\nRodney Maxwell finished the brandy in his glass and set it on the\r\ntable, then went to the pile of belts and holsters and began rummaging\r\nfor his own. Kurt Fawzi looked up in surprise.\r\n\r\n\"Rod, you're not leaving are you?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"Yes. It's only half an hour till time for dinner, and I think Conn\r\nand I ought to have a little fresh air. Besides, you know, we haven't\r\nseen each other for six years.\" He buckled on the heavy automatic and\r\nsettled the belt over his hips. \"You didn't have a gun, did you,\r\nConn?\" he asked. \"Well, let's go.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\n\r\nIt wasn't until they were down to the main level and outside in the\r\nlittle plaza to the east of the Airlines Building that his father\r\nbroke the silence.\r\n\r\n\"That was quite a talk you gave them, Conn. They believed every word\r\nof it. I even caught myself starting to believe it once or twice.\"\r\n\r\nConn stopped short; his father halted beside him. \"Why didn't you tell\r\nthem the truth, son?\" Rodney Maxwell asked.\r\n\r\nThe question, which he had been throwing at himself, angered him. \"Why\r\ndidn't I just grab a couple of pistols and shoot the lot of them?\" he\r\nretorted. \"It wouldn't have killed them any deader, and it wouldn't\r\nhave hurt as much.\"\r\n\r\n\"There is no Merlin. Is that it?\"\r\n\r\nHe realized, suddenly, that his father had known, or suspected that\r\nall along. He started to say something, then checked himself and began\r\nagain:\r\n\r\n\"There never was one. I was going to tell them, but you saw them. I\r\ncouldn't.\"\r\n\r\n\"You're sure of it?\"\r\n\r\n\"The whole thing's a myth. I'm quoting the one man in the Galaxy who\r\nought to know. The man who commanded the Third Force here during the\r\nWar.\"\r\n\r\n\"Foxx Travis!\" His father's voice was soft with wonder. \"I saw him\r\nonce, when I was eight years old. I thought he'd died long ago. Why,\r\nhe must be over a hundred.\"\r\n\r\n\"A hundred and twelve. He's living on Luna; low gravity's all that\r\nkeeps him alive.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you talked to him?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\nThere'd been a girl in his third-year biophysics class; he'd found out\r\nthat she was a great-granddaughter of Force General Travis. It had\r\ntaken him until his senior midterm vacation to wangle an invitation to\r\nthe dome-house on Luna. After that, it had been easy. As soon as Foxx\r\nTravis had learned that one of his great-granddaughter's guests was\r\nfrom Poictesme, he had insisted on talking to him.\r\n\r\n\"What did he tell you?\"\r\n\r\nThe old man had been incredibly thin and frail. Under normal\r\ngravitation, his life would have gone out like a blown match. Even at\r\none-sixth G, it had cost him effort to rise and greet the guest. There\r\nhad been a younger man, a mere stripling of seventy-odd; he had been\r\nworried, and excused himself at once. Travis had laughed after he had\r\ngone out.\r\n\r\n\"Mike Shanlee; my aide-de-camp on Poictesme. Now he thinks he's my\r\nkeeper. He'll have a squad of doctors and a platoon of nurses in here\r\nas soon as you're gone, so take your time. Now, tell me how things are\r\non Poictesme....\"\r\n\r\n\"Just about that,\" he told his father. \"I finally mentioned Merlin, as\r\nan old legend people still talked about. I was ashamed to admit\r\nanybody really believed in it. He laughed, and said, 'Great Ghu, is\r\nthat thing still around? Well, I suppose so; it was all through the\r\nThird Force during the War. Lord only knows how these rumors start\r\namong troops. We never contradicted it; it was good for morale.'\"\r\n\r\nThey had started walking again, and were out on the Mall; the sky was\r\nflaming red and orange from high cirrus clouds in the sunset light.\r\nThey stopped by a dry fountain, perhaps the one from which he had seen\r\nthe dust blowing. Rodney Maxwell sat down on the edge of the basin and\r\ngot out two cigars, handing one to Conn, who produced his lighter.\r\n\r\n\"Conn, they wouldn't have believed you _and_ Foxx Travis,\" he said.\r\n\"Merlin's a religion with those people. Merlin's a robot god,\r\nsomething they can shove all their problems onto. As soon as they find\r\nMerlin, everybody will be rich and happy, the Government bonds will be\r\nredeemed at face value plus interest, the paper money'll be worth a\r\nhundred Federation centisols to the sol, and the leaves and wastepaper\r\nwill be raked off the Mall, all by magic.\" He muttered an\r\nunprintability and laughed bitterly.\r\n\r\n\"I didn't know you were the village atheist, Father.\"\r\n\r\n\"In a religious community, the village atheist keeps his doubts to\r\nhimself. I have to do business with these Merlinolators. It's all I\r\ncan do to keep Flora from antagonizing them at school.\"\r\n\r\nFlora was a teacher; now she was assistant principal of the grade\r\nschools. Professor Kellton was also school superintendent. He could\r\nsee how that would be.\r\n\r\n\"Flora's not a True Believer, then?\"\r\n\r\nRodney Maxwell shook his head. \"That's largely Wade Lucas's influence,\r\nI'd say. You know about him.\"\r\n\r\nJust from letters. Wade Lucas was from Baldur; he'd gone off-planet\r\nas soon as he'd gotten his M.D. Evidently the professional situation\r\nthere was the same as on Terra; plenty of opportunities, and fifty\r\ncompetitors for each one. On Poictesme, there were few opportunities,\r\nbut nobody competed for anything, not even to find Merlin.\r\n\r\n\"He'd never heard of Merlin till he came here, and when he did, he\r\njust couldn't believe in it. I don't blame him. I've heard about it\r\nall my life, and I can't.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why not?\"\r\n\r\n\"To begin with, I suppose, because it's just another of these things\r\neverybody believes. Then, I've had to do some studying on the Third\r\nForce occupation of Poictesme to know where to go and dig, and I never\r\nfound any official, or even reliably unofficial, mention of anything\r\nof the sort. Forty years is a long time to keep a secret, you know.\r\nAnd I can't see why they didn't come back for it after the pressure to\r\nget the troops home was off, or why they didn't build a dozen Merlins.\r\nThis isn't the only planet that has problems they can't solve for\r\nthemselves.\"\r\n\r\n\"What's Mother's attitude on Merlin?\"\r\n\r\n\"She's against it. She thinks it isn't right to make machines that are\r\nsmarter than people.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll agree. It's scientifically impossible.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's what I've been trying to tell her. Conn, I noticed that after\r\nKurt Fawzi started talking about how long it would take to get to the\r\nGamma System, you jumped right into it and began talking up a ship.\r\nDid you think that if you got them started on that it would take their\r\nminds off Merlin?\"\r\n\r\n\"That gang up in Fawzi's office? Nifflheim, no! They'll go on hunting\r\nMerlin till they die. But I was serious about the ship. An idea hit\r\nme. You gave it to me; you and Klem Zareff.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, I didn't say a word ...\"\r\n\r\n\"Down on the shipping floor, before we went up. You were talking about\r\nselling arms and ammunition at a profit of two hundred sols a ton, and\r\nKlem was talking as though a bumper crop was worse than a Green Death\r\nepidemic. If we had a hypership, look what we could do. How much do\r\nyou think a settler on Hoth or Malebolge or Irminsul would pay for a\r\ngood rifle and a thousand rounds? How much would he pay for his\r\nlife?--that's what it would come to. And do you know what a fifteen-cc\r\nliqueur glass of Poictesme brandy sells for on Terra? One sol;\r\nFederation money. I'll admit it costs like Nifflheim to run a\r\nhypership, but look at the difference between what these tramp\r\nfreighter captains pay at Storisende and what they get.\"\r\n\r\n\"I've been looking at it for a long time. Maybe if we had a few ships\r\nof our own, these planters would be breaking new ground instead of\r\ncutting their plantings, and maybe we'd get some money on this planet\r\nthat was worth something. You have a good idea there, son. But maybe\r\nthere's an angle to it you haven't thought of.\"\r\n\r\nConn puffed slowly at the cigar. Why couldn't they grow tobacco like\r\nthis on Terra? Soil chemicals, he supposed; that wasn't his subject.\r\n\r\n\"You can't put this scheme over on its own merits. This gang wouldn't\r\nlift a finger to build a hypership. They've completely lost hope in\r\neverything but Merlin.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, can do. I'll even convince them that Merlin's a space-station,\r\nin orbit off Koshchei. I think I could do that.\"\r\n\r\n\"You know what it'll cost? If you go ahead with it, I'm in it with\r\nyou, make no mistake about that. But you and I will be the only two\r\npeople on Poictesme who can be trusted with the truth. We'll have to\r\nlie to everybody else, with every word we speak. We'll have to lie to\r\nFlora, and we'll have to lie to your mother. Your mother most of all.\r\nShe believes in absolutes. Lying is absolutely wrong, no matter whom\r\nit helps; telling the truth is absolutely right, no matter how much\r\ndamage it does or how many hearts it breaks. You think this is going\r\nto be worth a price like that?\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't you?\" he demanded, and then pointed along the crumbling and\r\nlittered Mall. \"Look at that. Pretend you never saw it before and are\r\nlooking at it for the first time. And then tell me whether it'll be\r\nworth it or not.\"\r\n\r\nHis father took a cigar from his mouth. For a moment, he sat staring\r\nsilently.\r\n\r\n\"Great Ghu!\" Rodney Maxwell turned. \"I wonder how that sneaked up on\r\nme; I honestly never realized.... Yes, Conn. This is a cause worth\r\nlying for.\" He looked at his watch. \"We ought to be starting for\r\nSenta's, but let's take a few minutes and talk this over. How are you\r\ngoing to get it started?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, convince them that I can find Merlin and that they can't find\r\nit without me. I think I've done that already. Then convince them that\r\nwe'll have to have a ship to get to Koshchei, and--\"\r\n\r\n\"Won't do. That'll take money, and money's something none of this gang\r\nhas.\"\r\n\r\n\"You heard me talk about the stuff I found out on Terra? Father, you\r\nhave no idea what all there is. You remember the old Force Command\r\nHeadquarters, the one the Planetary Government took over? I know where\r\nthere's a duplicate of that, completely underground. It has everything\r\nthe other one had, and a lot more, because it'll be cram-full of\r\nsupplies to be used in case of a general blitz that would knock out\r\neverything on the planet. And a chain of hospitals. And a spaceport,\r\nover on Barathrum, that was built inside the crater of an extinct\r\nvolcano. There won't be any hyperships there of course, but there'll\r\nbe equipment and material. We might be able to build a ship there. And\r\nsupply depots, all over the planet; none of them has ever been opened\r\nsince the War. Don't worry about financing; we have that.\"\r\n\r\nHis father, he could see, appreciated what he had brought home from\r\nTerra. He was nodding, with quick head jerks, at each item.\r\n\r\n\"That'll do it, all right. Now, listen; what we want to do is get a\r\ncompany organized, a regular limited-liability company, with a\r\ncharter. We'll contribute the information you brought back from Terra,\r\nand we'll get the rest of this gang to put all the money we can twist\r\nout of them into it, so we'll be sure they won't say, 'Aw, Nifflheim\r\nwith it!' and walk out on us as soon as the going gets a little\r\ntough.\" Rodney Maxwell got to his feet, hitching his gun-belt. \"I'll\r\npass the word to Kurt to get a meeting set up for tomorrow afternoon.\"\r\n\r\n\"What'll we call this company? Merlin Rediscovery, Ltd?\"\r\n\r\n\"No! We keep Merlin out of it. As far as the public is supposed to\r\nknow, this is just a war-material prospecting company. I'll impress on\r\nthem that Merlin is to be kept a secret. That way, we'll have to\r\nengage in regular prospecting and salvage work as a front. I'll see to\r\nit that the front is also the main objective.\" He nodded down the\r\nMall, toward the sunset, which was blazing even higher and redder.\r\n\"Well, let's go. You don't want to be late for your own welcome-home\r\nparty.\"\r\n\r\nThey walked slowly, still talking, until they came to the end of the\r\nMall. The escalators to the level below weren't working. Now that he\r\nthought of it, they hadn't been when he had gone away, six years ago,\r\nbut he could remember riding up and down on them as a small child. For\r\na moment they stood in the sunset light, looking down on the lower\r\nterrace as they finished their cigars.\r\n\r\nSenta's was mostly outdoors, the tables under the open sky. The people\r\ngathered below were looking at the sunset, too; Litchfielders loved to\r\nwatch sunsets, maybe because a sunset was one of the few things\r\neconomic conditions couldn't affect. There was Kurt Fawzi, the center\r\nof a group to whom he was declaiming earnestly; there was his mother,\r\nand Flora, and Flora's fiance, who was the uncomfortable lone man in\r\nan excited feminine flock. And there was Senta herself, short and\r\ndumpy, in one of her preposterous red and purple dresses, bubbling\r\nhappily one moment and screaming invective at some laggard waiter the\r\nnext.\r\n\r\nThey threw away their cigars and started down the long, motionless\r\nescalator. Conn Maxwell, Hero of the Hour, marching to Destiny. He\r\nseemed to hear trumpets sounding before him.\r\n\r\nAnd an occasional muted Bronx cheer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\n\r\nThe alarm chimed softly beside his bed; he reached out and silenced\r\nit, and lay looking at the early sunlight in the windows, and found\r\nthat he was wishing himself back in his dorm room at the University.\r\nNo, back in this room, ten years ago, before any of this had started.\r\nFor a while, he imagined himself thirteen years old and knowing\r\neverything he knew now, and he began mapping a campaign to establish\r\nhimself as Litchfield's Juvenile Delinquent Number One, to the end\r\nthat Kurt Fawzi and Dolf Kellton and the rest of them would never\r\ndream of sending him to school on Terra to find out where Merlin was.\r\n\r\nBut he couldn't even go back to yesterday afternoon in Kurt Fawzi's\r\noffice and tell them the truth. All he could do was go ahead. It had\r\nseemed so easy, when he and his father had been talking on the Mall;\r\njust get a ship built, and get out to Koshchei, and open some of the\r\nshipyards and engine works there, and build a hypership. Sure;\r\neasy--once he got started.\r\n\r\nHe climbed out of bed, knuckled the sleep-sand out of his eyes, threw\r\nhis robe around him, and started across the room to the bath cubicle.\r\n\r\nThey had decided to have breakfast together his first morning home.\r\nThe party had broken up late, and then there had been the excitement\r\nof opening the presents he had brought back from Terra. Nobody had had\r\na chance to talk about Merlin, or about what he was going to do, now\r\nthat he was home. That, and his career of mendacity, would start at\r\nbreakfast. He wanted to let his father get to the table first, to run\r\ninterference for him; he took his time with his toilet and dressed\r\ncarefully and slowly. Finally, he zipped up the short waist-length\r\njacket and went out.\r\n\r\nHis father and mother and Flora were at the table, and the\r\nserving-robot was floating around a few inches off the floor, steam\r\ntrailing from its coffee urn and its tray lid up to offer food. He\r\ngreeted everybody and sat down at his place, and the robot came around\r\nto him. His mother had selected all the things he'd been most fond of\r\nsix years ago: shovel-snout bacon, hotcakes, starberry jam, things he\r\nhadn't tasted since he had gone away. He filled his plate and poured a\r\ncup of coffee.\r\n\r\n\"You don't want to bother coming out to the dig with me this morning,\r\ndo you?\" his father was saying. \"I'll be back here for lunch, and\r\nwe'll go to the meeting in the afternoon.\"\r\n\r\n\"Meeting?\" Flora asked. \"What meeting?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, we didn't have time to tell you,\" Rodney Maxwell said. \"You know,\r\nConn brought back a lot of information on locations of supply depots\r\nand things like that. An amazing list of things that haven't been\r\ndiscovered yet. It's going to be too much for us to handle alone;\r\nwe're organizing a company to do it. We'll need a lot of labor, for\r\none thing; jobs for some of these Tramptowners.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's going to be something awfully big,\" his mother said dubiously.\r\n\"You never did anything like that before.\"\r\n\r\n\"I never had the kind of a partner I have now. It's Maxwell & Son,\r\nfrom now on.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who's going to be in this company?\" Flora wanted to know.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, everybody around town; Kurt and the Judge and Klem, and Lester\r\nDawes. All that crowd.\"\r\n\r\n\"The Fawzis' Office Gang,\" Flora said disparagingly. \"I suppose\r\nthey'll want Conn to take them right to where Merlin is, the first\r\nthing.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, not the first thing,\" Conn said. \"Merlin was one thing I\r\ncouldn't find out anything about on Terra.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll bet you couldn't!\"\r\n\r\n\"The people at Armed Forces Records would let me look at everything\r\nelse, and make microcopies and all, but not one word about computers.\r\nForty years, and they still have the security lid welded shut on\r\nthat.\"\r\n\r\nFlora looked at him in shocked surprise. \"You don't mean to tell me\r\nyou believe in that thing?\"\r\n\r\n\"Sure. How do you think they fought a war around a perimeter of close\r\nto a thousand light-years? They couldn't do all that out of their\r\nheads. They'd have to have computers, and the one they'd use to\r\ncorrelate everything and work out grand-strategy plans would have to\r\nbe a dilly. Why, I'd give anything just to look at the operating\r\npanels for that thing.\"\r\n\r\n\"But that's just a silly story; there never was anything like Merlin.\r\nNo wonder you couldn't find out about it. You were looking for\r\nsomething that doesn't exist, just like all these old cranks that sit\r\naround drinking brandy and mooning about what Merlin's going to do\r\nfor them, and never doing anything for themselves.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, they're going to do something, now, Flora,\" his father told her.\r\n\"When we get this company organized--\"\r\n\r\n\"You'll dig up a lot of stuff you won't be able to sell, like that\r\nstuff you've been bringing in from Tenth Army, and then you'll go\r\nlooping off chasing Merlin, like the rest of them. Well, maybe that'll\r\nbe a little better than just sitting in Kurt Fawzi's office talking\r\nabout it, but not much.\"\r\n\r\nIt kept on like that. Conn and his father tried several times to\r\nchange the subject; each time Flora ignored the effort and returned to\r\nher diatribe. Finally, she put her plate and cup on the robot's tray\r\nand got to her feet.\r\n\r\n\"I have to go,\" she said. \"Maybe I can do something to keep some of\r\nthese children from growing up to be Merlin-worshipers like their\r\nparents.\"\r\n\r\nShe flung out of the room angrily. Mrs. Maxwell looked after her in\r\ndistress.\r\n\r\n\"And I thought it was going to be so nice, having breakfast together\r\nagain,\" she lamented.\r\n\r\nSomehow the breakfast wasn't quite as good as he'd thought it was at\r\nfirst. He wondered how many more breakfasts like that he was going to\r\nhave to sit through. He and his father finished quickly and got up,\r\nwhile his mother started the robot to clearing the table.\r\n\r\n\"Conn,\" she said, after his father had gone out, \"you shouldn't have\r\ngotten Flora started like that.\"\r\n\r\n\"I didn't get Flora started; she's equipped with a self-starter. If\r\nshe doesn't believe in Merlin, that's her business. A lot of these\r\npeople do, and I'm going to help them hunt for it. That's why they all\r\nchipped in to send me to school on Terra; remember?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I know.\" Her voice was heavy with distress. \"Conn, do you really\r\nbelieve there is a ... that thing?\" she asked.\r\n\r\n\"Why, of course.\" He was mildly surprised at how sincerely and\r\nstraightforwardly he said it. \"I don't know where it is, but it's\r\nsomewhere on Poictesme, or in the Alpha System.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, do you think it would be a good thing to find it?\"\r\n\r\nThat surprised him. Everybody knew it would be, and his mother didn't\r\nshare his father's attitude about things everybody knew. She hadn't\r\nany business questioning a fundamental postulate like that.\r\n\r\n\"It frightens me,\" she continued. \"I don't even like to think about\r\nit. A soulless intelligence; it seems evil to me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, of course it's soulless. It's a machine, isn't it? An aircar's\r\nsoulless, but you're not afraid to ride in one.\"\r\n\r\n\"But this is different. A machine that can think. Conn, people weren't\r\nmeant to make machines like that, wiser than they are.\"\r\n\r\n\"Now wait a minute, Mother. You're talking to a computerman now.\"\r\nProfessional authority was something his mother oughtn't to question.\r\n\"A computer like Merlin isn't intelligent, or wise, or anything of the\r\nsort. It doesn't think; the people who make computers and use them do\r\nthe thinking. A computer's a tool, like a screwdriver; it has to have\r\na man to use it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, but....\"\r\n\r\n\"And please, don't talk about what people are _meant_ to do. People\r\naren't _meant_ to do things; they _mean_ to do things, and nine times\r\nout of ten, they end by doing them. It may take a hundred thousand\r\nyears from a Stone Age savage in a cave to the captain of a hyperspace\r\nship, but sooner or later they get there.\"\r\n\r\nHis mother was silent. The soulless machine that had been clearing the\r\ntable floated out of the room, the dishwasher in its rectangular belly\r\ngurgling. Maybe what he had told her was logical, but women aren't\r\nimpressed by logic. She knew better--for the good old feminine reason,\r\n_Because_.\r\n\r\n\"Wade Lucas wanted me to drop in on him for a checkup,\" he mentioned.\r\n\"That's rubbish; I had one for my landing pratique on the ship. He\r\njust wants to size up his future brother-in-law.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, you ought to go see him.\"\r\n\r\n\"How did Flora come to meet him, anyhow?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, you know, he came from Baldur. He was in Storisende, looking\r\nfor an opening to start a practice, and he heard about some medical\r\nequipment your father had found somewhere and came out to see if he\r\ncould buy it. Your father and Judge Ledue and Mr. Fawzi talked him\r\ninto opening his office here. Then he and Flora got acquainted....\"\r\nShe asked, anxiously: \"What did you think of him, Conn?\"\r\n\r\n\"Seems like a regular guy. I think I'll like him.\" A husband like Wade\r\nLucas might be a good thing for Flora. \"I'll drop in on him, sometime\r\nthis morning.\"\r\n\r\nHis mother went toward the rear of the house--more soulless machines,\r\nlike the housecleaning-robot, and the laundry-robot, to look after. He\r\nwent into his father's office and found the cigar humidor, just where\r\nit had been when he'd stolen cigars out of it six years ago and\r\nthought his father never suspected what he was doing.\r\n\r\nNow, why didn't they export this tobacco? It was better than anything\r\nthey grew on Terra; well, at least it was different, just as Poictesme\r\nbrandy was different from Terran bourbon or Baldur honey-rum. That was\r\nthe sort of thing that could be sold in interstellar trade anytime and\r\nanywhere; the luxury goods that were unique. Staple foodstuffs,\r\nutility textiles, metal products, could be produced anywhere, and\r\nsooner or later they were. That was the reason for the original,\r\npre-War depression: the customers were all producing for themselves.\r\nHe'd talk that over with his father. He wished he'd had time to take\r\nsome economics at the University.\r\n\r\nHe found the file his father kept up-to-date on salvage sites found\r\nand registered with the Claims Office in Storisende. Some of the\r\nlocations he had brought back data for had been discovered, but, to\r\nhis relief, not the underground duplicate Force Command Headquarters,\r\nand not the spaceport on the island continent of Barathrum, to the\r\neast. That was all right.\r\n\r\nHe went to the house-defense arms closet and found a 10-mm Navy\r\npistol, and a belt and spare clips. Making sure that the pistol and\r\nmagazines were loaded, he buckled it on. He debated getting a vehicle\r\nout of the hangar on the landing stage, decided against it, and\r\nstarted downtown on foot.\r\n\r\nOne of the first people he met was Len Yeniguchi, the tailor. He would\r\nbe at the meeting that afternoon. He managed, while talking, to\r\ncomment on the cut of Conn's suit, and finger the material.\r\n\r\n\"Ah, nice,\" he complimented. \"Made on Terra? We don't see cloth like\r\nthat here very often.\"\r\n\r\nHe meant it wasn't Armed Forces salvage.\r\n\r\n\"Father ought to be around to see you with a bolt of material, to have\r\na suit made,\" he said. \"For Ghu's sake, either talk him into having a\r\nshort jacket like this, or get him to buy himself a shoulder holster.\r\nHe's ruined every coat he ever owned, carrying a gun on his hip.\"\r\n\r\nA little farther on, he came to a combat car grounded in the middle of\r\nthe street. It was green, with black trimmings, and lettered in black,\r\nGORDON VALLEY HOME GUARD. Tom Brangwyn was standing beside\r\nit, talking to a young man in a green uniform.\r\n\r\n\"Hello, Conn.\" The town marshal looked at his hip and grinned. \"See\r\nyou got all your clothes on this morning. You were just plain\r\nindecent, yesterday.... You know Fred Karski, don't you?\"\r\n\r\nYes, now that Tom mentioned it, he did. He and Fred had gone to school\r\ntogether at the Litchfield Academy. But the six years since they'd\r\nseen each other last had made a lot of difference in both of them. He\r\nwas beginning to think that the only strangers in Litchfield were his\r\nown contemporaries. They shook hands, and Conn looked at the combat\r\ncar and Fred Karski's uniform.\r\n\r\n\"What's going on?\" he asked. \"The System States Alliance to business\r\nagain?\"\r\n\r\nKarski laughed. \"Oh, that's the Colonel's idea. Green and black were\r\nhis colors in the War, and he's in command of the regiment.\"\r\n\r\n\"Regiment? You need a whole regiment?\" Conn asked.\r\n\r\n\"Well, it's two companies, each about the size of a regular army\r\nplatoon, but we have to call it a regiment so he can keep his old\r\nRebel Army rank.\"\r\n\r\n\"We could use a regiment, Conn,\" Tom Brangwyn said seriously. \"You\r\nhave no idea how bad things have gotten. Over on the east coast, the\r\noutlaws are looting whole towns. About four months ago, they sacked\r\nWaterville; burned the whole town and killed close to a hundred\r\npeople. That was Blackie Perales' gang.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who is this Blackie Perales? I heard the name mentioned in connection\r\nwith the _Harriet Barne_.\"\r\n\r\n\"Blackie Perales is anybody the Planetary Government can't catch,\r\nwhich means practically any outlaw,\" Fred Karski said.\r\n\r\n\"No, Fred; there is a Blackie Perales,\" Tom Brangwyn said. \"He used to\r\nbe a planter, down in the south. The banks foreclosed on him when he\r\ncouldn't pay his notes, and he turned outlaw. That's the way it's\r\ngoing, all around. Every time a planter loses his plantation or a\r\nfarmer loses his farm, or a mechanic loses his job, he turns outlaw.\r\nTake Tramptown, here. We used to plant nothing but melons. Then, when\r\nthe sale for wine and brandy dropped, the melon-planters began cutting\r\ntheir melon crops and raising produce, instead of buying it from up\r\nnorth, and turning land into pasture for cattle. The people we used to\r\nbuy foodstuffs from couldn't sell all they raised, and that threw a\r\nlot of farmhands out of work. So they got the idea there was work\r\nhere, and they came flocking in, and when they couldn't get jobs, they\r\njust stayed in Tramptown, stealing anything they could. We don't even\r\ntry to police Tramptown any more; we just see to it they don't come up\r\nhere.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, where do these outlaws and pirates who are looting whole towns\r\ncome from?\"\r\n\r\n\"Down in the Badlands, mostly. None of them have been bothering us,\r\nsince we organized the Home Guard. They tried to, a couple of times,\r\nat first. There may have been a few survivors; they spread it around\r\nthat Gordon Valley wasn't any outlaws' health resort.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why don't you join us, Conn?\" Fred Karski asked. \"All our old gang\r\nbelong.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'd like to, but I'm afraid I'm going to be kind of busy.\"\r\n\r\nBrangwyn nodded. \"Yes. You will be, at that,\" he agreed.\r\n\r\n\"So I hear,\" Fred Karski said. \"Do you really know where it is,\r\nConn?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, no.\" He went into the routine about Merlin being still\r\nclassified triple-top secret. \"But we'll find it. It may take time,\r\nbut we will.\"\r\n\r\nThey talked for a while. He asked more questions about the Home Guard.\r\nHis father, it seemed, had donated all the equipment. They had a\r\nhundred and seventy men on the active list, but they had a reserve of\r\nover eight hundred, and combat vehicles and weapons on all the\r\nplantations and in all the towns along the river. The reserve had only\r\nbeen turned out twice; both times, outlaw attacks had been stopped\r\ndead--literally. The Home Guard, it appeared, was not given to making\r\narrests or taking prisoners. Finally, he parted from them, strolling\r\non along the row of stores and business places, many vacant, under the\r\nsouth edge of the Mall, until he saw a fluorolite sign, WADE\r\nLUCAS, M. D. He entered.\r\n\r\nLucas wasn't busy. They went into his consultation office, and Conn\r\ntook off his gun-belt and hung it up; Lucas offered cigarettes, and\r\nthey lighted and sat down.\r\n\r\n\"I see you've started carrying one,\" he said, nodding to the pistol\r\nConn had laid aside.\r\n\r\n\"Civic obligation. I'm going to be too busy for Home Guard duty, but\r\nif I can protect myself, it'll save somebody else the job of\r\nprotecting me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Maybe if there weren't so many guns around, there wouldn't be so much\r\ntrouble.\"\r\n\r\nHe felt his good opinion of Wade Lucas start to slip. The Liberals on\r\nTerra had been full of that kind of talk, which was why only four out\r\nof ten of last year's graduating class at Armed Forces Academy had\r\nbeen able to get active commissions. The last war had been a disaster,\r\nso don't prepare for another one; when it comes, let it be a worse\r\ndisaster.\r\n\r\n\"Guns don't make trouble; people make trouble. If the troublemakers\r\nare armed, you have to be armed too. When did you last see an Air\r\nPatrol boat around here, or even a Constabulary trooper? All we have\r\nhere is the Home Guard and Tom Brangwyn and three deputies, and his\r\npay and theirs is always six months in arrears.\"\r\n\r\nLucas nodded. \"A bankrupt government, an unemployment rate that rises\r\nevery year, currency that buys less every month. And do-it-yourself\r\njustice.\" The doctor blew a smoke ring and watched it float toward the\r\nventilator-intake. \"You said you're going to be busy. This company\r\nyour father's talking about organizing?\"\r\n\r\n\"That's right. You're going to be at the meeting at the Academy this\r\nafternoon, aren't you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. Just what are you going to do, after you get it organized?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I brought back information on a great deal of undiscovered\r\nequipment and stores that the Third Force left behind....\" He talked\r\non for some time, keeping to safe generalities. \"It's too big for my\r\nfather and me to handle alone, even if we didn't feel morally\r\nobligated to take in the people who contributed toward sending me to\r\nschool on Terra. You ought to be interested in it. I know of six fully\r\nsupplied hospitals, intended to take care of the casualties in case of\r\na System States space-attack. You can imagine, better than I can, what\r\nwould be in them.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. Medical supplies of all sorts are getting hard to find. But look\r\nhere; you're not going to let these people waste time looking for this\r\nalleged computer, this thing they call Merlin, are you?\"\r\n\r\n\"We're looking for any valuable war material. I don't know the\r\nlocation of Merlin, but--\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll bet you don't!\" Lucas said vehemently. That was the same thing\r\nFlora had said.\r\n\r\n\"--but Merlin is undoubtedly the most valuable item of abandoned TF\r\nequipment on this planet. In the long run, I'd say, more valuable than\r\neverything else together. We certainly aren't going to ignore it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good heavens, Conn! You aren't like these people here; you were\r\neducated at the University of Montevideo.\"\r\n\r\n\"So I was. I studied computer theory and practice. I have some doubts\r\nabout Merlin being able to do some of the things these laymen like\r\nKellton and Fawzi and Judge Ledue think it could. Those sorts of\r\nmisconceptions and exaggerations have to be allowed for. But I have no\r\ndoubt whatever that the master computer with which they did their\r\nstrategic planning is probably the greatest mechanism of its sort ever\r\nbuilt, and I have no doubt whatever that it still exists somewhere in\r\nthe Alpha System.\"\r\n\r\nHe almost convinced himself of it. He did not, however, convince Wade\r\nLucas, who was now regarding him with narrow-eyed suspicion.\r\n\r\n\"You mean you categorically state that that computer actually exists?\"\r\n\r\n\"That, I think, was the general idea. Yes. I certainly do believe that\r\nMerlin exists.\"\r\n\r\nMaybe he was telling the truth. Merlin existed in the beliefs and\r\nhopes of people like Dolf Kellton and Klem Zareff and Judge Ledue and\r\nKurt Fawzi. Merlin was a god to them. Well, take Ghu, the Thoran\r\nGrandfather-God. Ghu was as preposterous, theologically, as Merlin was\r\ntechnologically; Ghu, except to Thorans, was a Federation-wide joke.\r\nBut he'd known a couple of Thorans at the University, funny little\r\nfellows, with faces like terriers, their bodies covered with matted\r\nblack hair. They believed in Ghu the way he believed in the Second Law\r\nof Thermodynamics. Ghu was with them every moment of their lives. Take\r\naway their belief in Ghu, and they would have been lost and wretched.\r\n\r\nAs lost and wretched as Kurt Fawzi or Judge Ledue, if they lost their\r\nbelief in Merlin. He started to say something like that, and then\r\nthought better of it.\r\n\r\nYes, Virginia, there _is_ a Santa Claus.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\n\r\nThe meeting was at the Academy; when Conn and his father arrived, they\r\nfound the central hall under the topside landing stage crowded. Kurt\r\nFawzi and Professor Kellton had constituted themselves a reception\r\ncommittee. Franz Veltrin was in evidence with his audiovisual\r\nrecorder, and Colonel Zareff was leaning on his silver-headed sword\r\ncane. Tom Brangwyn, in an unaccustomed best-suit. Wade Lucas, among a\r\ngroup of merchants, arguing heatedly. Lorenzo Menardes, the\r\ndistiller, and Lester Dawes, the banker, and Morgan Gatworth, the\r\nlawyer, talking to Judge Ledue. About four times as many as had been\r\nin Fawzi's office the afternoon before.\r\n\r\nFinally, everybody was shepherded into a faculty conference room;\r\nthere was a long table, and a shorter one T-wise at one end. Fawzi and\r\nKellton conducted them to this. Both of them were trying to preside,\r\nKellton because it was his Academy, and Fawzi ex officio as mayor and\r\nprofessional leading citizen, and because he had come to regard Merlin\r\nas his own private project. After everybody else was seated, the two\r\nrival chairmen-presumptive remained on their feet. Fawzi was saying,\r\n\"Let's come to order; we must conduct this meeting regularly,\" and\r\nKellton was saying, \"Gentlemen, please; let me have your attention.\"\r\n\r\nIf either of them took the chair, the other would resent it. Conn got\r\nto his feet again.\r\n\r\n\"Somebody will have to preside,\" he said, loudly enough to cut through\r\nthe babble at the long table. \"Would you take the chair, Judge Ledue?\"\r\n\r\nThat stopped it. Neither of them wanted to contest the honor with the\r\npresident-judge of the Gordon Valley court.\r\n\r\n\"Excellent suggestion, Conn. Judge, will you preside?\" Professor\r\nKellton, who had seen himself losing out to Fawzi, asked. Fawzi threw\r\none quick look around, estimated the situation, and got with it. \"Of\r\ncourse, Judge. You're the logical chairman. Here, will you sit here?\"\r\n\r\nJudge Ledue took the chair, looked around for something to use as a\r\ngavel, and rapped sharply with a paperweight.\r\n\r\n\"Young Mr. Conn Maxwell, who has just returned from Terra, needs no\r\nintroduction to any of you,\" he began. Then, having established that,\r\nhe took the next ten minutes to introduce Conn. When people began\r\nfidgeting, he wound up with: \"Now, only about a dozen of us were at\r\nthe informal meeting in Mr. Fawzi's office, yesterday. Conn, would you\r\nplease repeat what you told us? Elaborate as you see fit.\"\r\n\r\nConn rose. He talked briefly about his studies on Terra to qualify\r\nhimself as an expert. Then he began describing the wealth of abandoned\r\nand still undiscovered Federation war material and the many\r\ninstallations of which he had learned, careful to avoid giving clues\r\nto exact locations. The spaceport; the underground duplicate Force\r\nCommand Headquarters; the vast underground arsenals and shops and\r\nsupply depots. Everybody was awed, even his father; he hadn't had time\r\nto tell him more than a fraction of it.\r\n\r\nFinally, somebody from the long table interrupted:\r\n\r\n\"Well, Conn; how about Merlin? That's what we're interested in.\"\r\n\r\nWade Lucas snorted indignantly.\r\n\r\n\"He's telling you about real things, things worth millions of sols,\r\nand you want him to talk about that idiotic fantasy!\"\r\n\r\nThere was an angry outcry. Nobody actually shouted \"_To the stake with\r\nthe blasphemer!_\" but that was the general idea. Judge Ledue was\r\nrapping loudly for order.\r\n\r\n\"I don't know the exact location of Merlin.\" Conn strove to make\r\nhimself heard. \"The whole subject's classified top secret. But I am\r\ncertain that Merlin exists, if not on Poictesme then somewhere in the\r\nAlpha System, and I am equally certain that we can find it.\"\r\n\r\nCheers. He waited for the hubbub to subside. Lucas was trying to yell\r\nabove it.\r\n\r\n\"You admit you couldn't learn anything about this so-called Merlin,\r\nbut you're still certain it exists?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why are you certain it doesn't?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, the whole thing's absurdly fantastic!\"\r\n\r\n\"Maybe it is, to a layman like you. I studied computers, and it isn't\r\nto me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, take all these elaborate preparations against space attack you\r\nwere telling us about. I think Colonel Zareff, here, who served in the\r\nAlliance Army, will bear me out that such an attack was plainly\r\nimpossible.\"\r\n\r\nZareff started to agree, then realized that he was aiding and\r\ncomforting the enemy. \"Intelligence lag,\" he said. \"What do you\r\nexpect, with General Headquarters thirty parsecs from the fighting?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. A computer can only process the data that's been taped into it,\"\r\nConn said. That was a point he wanted to ram home, as forcibly and as\r\noften as possible. \"I suppose Merlin classified an Alliance attack on\r\nPoictesme as a low-order probability, but war is the province of\r\nchance; Clausewitz said that a thousand years ago. Foxx Travis wasn't\r\nthe sort of commander to let himself get caught, even by a very\r\nlow-order probability.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well how do you explain the absence, after forty years, of any\r\nmention, in any history of the War, of Merlin? How do you get around\r\nthat?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't have to. How do you get around it?\"\r\n\r\n\"_Huh?_\" Lucas was startled.\r\n\r\n\"Yes. Stories about Merlin were all over Poictesme, all through the\r\nThird Force, even to the enemy. Say the stories were unfounded; say\r\nMerlin never existed. Yet the belief in Merlin was an important\r\nhistorical fact, and no history of the War gives it so much as a\r\nfootnote.\" He paused for effect, then continued: \"That can mean only\r\none thing. Systematic suppression, backed by the whole force of the\r\nTerran Federation. A gigantic conspiracy of silence!\"\r\n\r\nBrother! If they swallow that, I have it made; they'll swallow\r\nanything!\r\n\r\nThey did, all but Lucas. He banged his fist on the table.\r\n\r\n\"Now I've heard everything!\" he shouted in disgust.\r\n\r\n\"Not quite everything, Doctor,\" Morgan Gatworth said. \"You will hear,\r\none of these days, that we have found Merlin.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, that'll be the day!\" Lucas sprang to his feet, his chair\r\ntoppling behind him. He shoved it aside with his foot. \"I'm not going\r\nto argue with you. Conn Maxwell gave you a thousand-year-old\r\nquotation; I'll give you another, from Thomas Paine: 'To argue with\r\nthose who have renounced the use and authority of reason is as futile\r\nas to administer medicine to the dead.' I'll add this. Conn Maxwell\r\nknows better than this balderdash he's been spouting to you. I don't\r\nknow what his racket is, and I'm not staying to find out. You will,\r\nthough--to your regret.\"\r\n\r\nHe turned and strode from the room. There was a moment's silence,\r\nafter the door slammed behind him. Too bad, Conn thought. He would\r\nhave made a good friend. Now he was going to make a very nasty enemy.\r\n\r\n\"Well, let's get to business,\" his father said. \"We don't have to\r\nargue about the existence of Merlin; we know that. Let's discuss the\r\nquestion of finding it.\"\r\n\r\n\"I still think it's somewhere off-planet,\" Lorenzo Menardes said. \"The\r\nmoons of Pantagruel....\"\r\n\r\nEvidently he'd read something, or seen an old film, about the moons of\r\nPantagruel.\r\n\r\n\"No, that's too far; they'd keep it where they could use it.\"\r\n\r\n\"The old GHQ,\" Lester Dawes suggested. \"Suppose it's down under that,\r\nlike the place Rodney found under Tenth Army.\"\r\n\r\n\"I hope not,\" Gathworth said. \"The Planetary Government took that\r\nover.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, wherever it is, finding it is going to be expensive,\" Rodney\r\nMaxwell said. \"Now, to finance the search, I propose we use this\r\ninformation my son brought back from Terra. Doctor Lucas was right\r\nabout one thing; that's worth millions of sols. Well, I propose, also,\r\nthat we set up a company and get it chartered; a prospecting company,\r\nto operate under the Abandoned Property Act of 867. My son and I will\r\ncontribute this information as our share in the capitalization of the\r\ncompany. The work of opening these Federation installations can go on\r\nconcurrently with the search for Merlin, and the profits can finance\r\nit.\"\r\n\r\nSilence for a moment, then a bedlam of cheering.\r\n\r\n\"Well, let's get organized,\" Gatworth said. \"What will we call this\r\ncompany?\"\r\n\r\nA number of voices shouted suggestions. Rodney Maxwell managed to get\r\nrecognition and partial silence.\r\n\r\n\"It is of the first importance,\" he said, \"that we keep our real\r\nobjective--Merlin--as close a secret as possible. The Planetary\r\nGovernment would like to get hold of it--and I leave you to ask\r\nyourselves how far Jake Vyckhoven and his cronies are to be trusted\r\nwith anything like that--and I have no doubt the Federation might try\r\nto take it away from us.\"\r\n\r\n\"Couldn't do it, Rodney,\" Judge Ledue objected. \"Everything the\r\nFederation abandoned in the Trisystem is public domain now. We have a\r\nFederation Supreme Court ruling--\"\r\n\r\n\"What's legality to the Federation?\" Klem Zareff demanded. \"They\r\nfought a criminally illegal war of aggression against my people.\"\r\n\r\nDown the table, somebody started singing \"Rally Round the Banner, the\r\nBanner Black and Green.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I think it's a good idea to keep quiet about it, myself,\" Kurt\r\nFawzi said.\r\n\r\n\"All right,\" Rodney Maxwell said. \"Then we don't want this company to\r\nsound like anything but another salvage company. I suggest we call it\r\nLitchfield Exploration & Salvage.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good name, Rodney,\" Dawes approved. \"That a motion? I second it.\"\r\n\r\nUnanimously carried. They had a name, now, anyhow. Everybody began\r\nsuggesting other topics for consideration--capitalization, application\r\nfor charter, election of officers, stock issues. Conn paid less and\r\nless attention. Industrial finance and organization wasn't his\r\nsubject, either. His father was plunging happily into it as though he\r\nhad been promoting companies all his life. Conn sat and doodled with\r\nhis six-color pen, mostly spherical hyperspace ships.\r\n\r\n\"We can't get all this cleared up now,\" Lester Dawes was protesting.\r\n\"Your Honor, I mean, Mr. Chairman; I suggest that committees be\r\nappointed....\"\r\n\r\nMore hassling; everybody wanted to be on all the committees. Finally,\r\nthey appointed enough committees to include everybody.\r\n\r\n\"Well, that seems to be cleared up,\" Judge Ledue said, \"I suggest a\r\nmeeting day after tomorrow evening; the committees should have\r\neverything set up, and we should be able to organize ourselves and\r\nelect permanent officers. Is there anything else to discuss, or do I\r\nhear a motion to adjourn?\"\r\n\r\nSomebody thought they ought to have some idea of what the first\r\noperation would be.\r\n\r\n\"You heard me mention a spaceport,\" Conn said. \"I can tell you, now,\r\nthat it's over on Barathrum, inside the crater of an extinct volcano.\r\nI think we ought to have a look at that, first of all.\"\r\n\r\n\"I know you seemed to think yesterday that Merlin is off-planet,\"\r\nFawzi said, \"I'm inclined to disagree, Conn. I think it's right here\r\non Poictesme.\"\r\n\r\n\"We ought to nail that spaceport down first,\" Conn argued.\r\n\r\n\"Conn, you mentioned an underground duplicate of Travis's general\r\nheadquarters,\" Zareff said. \"They thought we'd possibly send a fleet\r\nhere to blitz Poictesme, or they wouldn't have built that. And this\r\nunderground headquarters would be the safest place on the planet;\r\nthey'd make sure of that. Staff brass don't like to get caught out in\r\nthe rain, not when it's raining hellburners and planetbusters. Merlin\r\nwould be too big to take there along with them, so they'd put it there\r\nin the first place.\"\r\n\r\nThat made sense. If he'd been Foxx Travis, and if there had been a\r\nMerlin, that was exactly where he'd have put it himself. But there was\r\nno Merlin, and he wanted a ship. He argued mulishly for a little, then\r\nsaw that it was hopeless and gave in.\r\n\r\n\"I want to find Merlin as much as any of you,\" he said. \"More. Merlin\r\nwas the only thing I was trained for. We'll look there first.\"\r\n\r\nSomebody asked where, approximately, this underground Force Command\r\nheadquarters was.\r\n\r\n\"Why, it's in the Badlands, over between the Blaubergs and the east\r\ncoast.\"\r\n\r\n\"Great Ghu! We'll need an army to go in there!\" Tom Brangwyn said.\r\n\"That's where all these outlaws have been coming from, Blackie Perales\r\nand all.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then we'll get an army together,\" Klem Zareff said happily. \"Might\r\nmake a little of that reward money that's been offered.\"\r\n\r\n\"We'll need more than that. Well need excavation equipment, and labor.\r\nLots of labor,\" Conn said. \"It's a couple of hundred feet below the\r\nsurface; from the plans, I'd say they just dug a big pit, built the\r\nheadquarters in it, and filled it in. There are two entrances, a\r\nvertical shaft and a horizontal tunnel.\"\r\n\r\n\"When they pulled out, they probably filled the shaft and vitrified\r\nthe rock at the outer ends,\" his father added. \"That was what they did\r\nat Tenth Army.\"\r\n\r\nAnother idea hit him. \"Mr. Mayor, do you think you could set up some\r\nkind of a public-works program here in Litchfield? We can't start this\r\ntill after the wine-pressing's over, and we'll need a lot of labor, as\r\nI pointed out. Now, it's important that we keep all our projects a\r\nsecret until we can get our claims filed. If we start this municipal\r\nfix-up-and-clean-up program, we can give work to a lot of these\r\ndrifters who haven't been able to get jobs on the plantations, get\r\nthem organized into gangs, and keep them together till we're ready for\r\nthe Force Command job.\"\r\n\r\nLorenzo Menardes supported the idea. \"And while they were boondoggling\r\naround in Litchfield, we could pick out the best workers, get rid of\r\nthe incompetents, and train a few supervisors. That's going to be one\r\nof our worst headaches; getting capable supervisors.\"\r\n\r\n\"You telling me?\" Rodney Maxwell asked. \"That was what I was wondering\r\nabout: where we'd get gang-bosses. And another thing; this municipal\r\nhousecleaning would mask our real preparations.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, we need something like that,\" Fawzi said. \"We've needed it for\r\na long time. I guess it took Conn, coming home from Terra, to see how\r\nbadly we've let the town get run down. Franz, suppose you and Tom\r\nBrangwyn and Lorenzo form a committee on that. Look around, see what\r\nneeds fixing up worst, and set up a project. Who's city engineer now?\"\r\n\r\n\"Abe O'Leary; he died six years ago,\" Dawes said. \"You never appointed\r\nhis successor.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I guess I never got around to that,\" the mayor of Litchfield\r\nadmitted.\r\n\r\nWhen the meeting finally adjourned, they went up and got in the car;\r\nhis father lifted it straight up to thirty thousand feet and started\r\ncircling. An aircar was one place where they could talk safely.\r\n\r\n\"Conn, I was kind of worried, down there. You were being a little too\r\npositive. You know, you're only twenty-three. As long as you agree\r\nwith those people, you're a brilliant young man; you start getting\r\nideas of your own, and you're just a half-baked kid. You let the older\r\nand wiser heads run things. You can't begin to hope to foul things up\r\nthe way they can. Look at all the experience they've had.\"\r\n\r\n\"But we've got to have a ship. Everything depends on that.\"\r\n\r\n\"I know it does. We'll get a ship. Let Kurt Fawzi and Klem Zareff and\r\nthe rest of them have this duplicate Force Command thing first,\r\nthough. Keep them happy. As soon as we have that opened, you can take\r\na gang and run over to Barathrum and grab your spaceport. Wait till\r\nthey find out that Merlin isn't at Force Command Duplicate. Then you\r\ncan convince them it's really on Koshchei.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\n\r\nThe car Rodney Maxwell got out of the hangar the next morning wasn't\r\nthe one he and Conn had gone to the meeting in; it was the one he had\r\nflown in from Tenth Army HQ at noon of the previous day. An Army\r\nreconnaissance job, slim and needlelike, completely enclosed, looking\r\nmore like a missile than a vehicle, and armored in dazzling,\r\niridescent collapsium. There was something to living on Poictesme, at\r\nthat; only a millionaire on Terra could have owned a car like that.\r\n\r\n\"Nice,\" Conn said. \"Where did you dig it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Where we're going, Tenth Army.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll bet she'll do Mach Three.\"\r\n\r\n\"Better than that. I've never had her above 2.5, but the airspeed\r\ngauge is marked up to four. And she has everything: all kinds of\r\ndetection instruments, cameras, audiovisual pickups, armament. And\r\nthe armor; you can take her through any kind of radiation.\"\r\n\r\nThe armor was only a couple of micromicrons thick, but it would stop\r\nanything. It was collapsed matter, the electron shells of the atoms\r\ncollapsed upon the nuclei, the atoms in actual contact. That plating\r\nmade eighth-inch sheet steel as heavy as twelve-inch armor plate, and\r\nin texture and shielding properties, lead was like sponge by\r\ncomparison.\r\n\r\nThey climbed in, and Rodney Maxwell snapped on the screens that served\r\nas windows. Conn leaned back and looked at the underside view in a\r\nscreen on the roof of the car, as his father started the lift-engine.\r\n\r\n\"Still think it's worth the price, son?\" his father asked.\r\n\r\nThe price had begun to rise; even so, he was afraid that what they had\r\npaid so far was only the down payment. Dinner last evening. Flora, who\r\nhad evidently been talking to Wade Lucas, shouting accusations at\r\nthem; his mother fleeing from the table in tears. As the car rose, he\r\nreached out and turned on and adjusted the telescreen for the\r\nunder-view.\r\n\r\n\"Keep your eye on that, Father,\" he said. \"That's what we're paying to\r\nget rid of.\"\r\n\r\nA distillery, bigger than the Menardes plant, long closed and now half\r\nroofless and crumbling. Rows of warehouses, empty after the War until\r\ntaken over by homeless vagrants. Jerry-built shanties with rattletrap\r\naircars grounded around them. Tramptown, a festering sore on the south\r\nside of Litchfield.\r\n\r\n\"If we put this over,\" he continued, \"all those tramps will have\r\nsteady work and good homes. We can have a park there, with fountains\r\nthat'll work. Maybe even Flora and Mother will think we've done\r\nsomething worth doing.\"\r\n\r\n\"It'll be kind of hard to take in the meantime, though, but if you can\r\ntake it, I can.\" Rodney Maxwell turned off the underside teleview\r\nscreen and put on the forward one. \"See that little pink spot over\r\nthere? Sunrise on the east side of Snagtooth; Tenth Army's just behind\r\nus. Now, let's see if this airspeed gauge is telling the truth or just\r\nbragging.\"\r\n\r\nSudden acceleration pushed them back in their seats. The calibrations\r\non the gauge rose swiftly; the pink-lighted peak grew swiftly in the\r\nteleview screen. The gauge hadn't been bragging, it had been\r\nunderstating; the car had more speed than the instrument could\r\nregister. Two and a half minutes from Litchfield, they were\r\ndecelerating and swinging slowly around Snagtooth, looking down on a\r\ntilted plateau that ended on the western side in a sheer drop of\r\nalmost a thousand feet.\r\n\r\nThere were ruinous buildings on it: barracks and storehouses and\r\noffices, an airship dock and an air-traffic control tower from which\r\nall the glass had long ago vanished, a great steel telecast tower that\r\nhad fallen, crushing a couple of buildings. Young trees had already\r\ngrown among the wreckage.\r\n\r\n\"Look over there, on the slope below it; there's one entrance to the\r\nshelters.\" There was a clearing among the evergreens, half a mile from\r\nthe buildings, and raw earth, and a couple of big scows grounded near.\r\n\"They bulldozed rock and earth over the end of the tunnel. Then,\r\nthere's another one down on that bench, a couple of hundred feet below\r\nthe edge of the plateau. They blasted rock down over that. The main\r\nentrance is a vertical shaft under that pre-stressed concrete dome.\r\nThat was chapel, auditorium, or something. They just covered it with\r\nsheet metal and poured a foot of concrete on top.\"\r\n\r\nThey floated down above the broken roofs and crumbling walls, and\r\ngrounded in the area between the main administration building and the\r\noffices, back of the ship docks. Once, he supposed, it had been a\r\nlawn. Then it had been a jungle. Now it was a scuffed, littered,\r\nbare-trodden work-yard. Men were straggling out of the administration\r\nbuilding, lighting pipes and cigarettes; they all wore new but\r\nwork-soiled infantry battle dress. All of them waved and shouted\r\ngreetings; one, about Conn's own age, approached. As he got out, Conn\r\nsaw the resemblance to Lester Dawes, the banker, before he recognized\r\nAnse Dawes, who had been one of his closest friends six years ago.\r\nThey shook hands and pounded each other on the back.\r\n\r\n\"Hey, you're looking great, Conn!\" They all told him that; he'd begin\r\nto believe it pretty soon. \"Sorry I couldn't make the party, but\r\nsomebody had to sit on the lid here, and Jerry Rivas and I cut cards\r\nfor it and Jerry won.\"\r\n\r\n\"You didn't tell me Anse was with you,\" he reproached his father.\r\nRodney Maxwell said he'd been saving that for a surprise.\r\n\r\nWhen Conn asked Anse what was the matter with the bank, he said: \"For\r\nthe birds; I'd as soon count sheets of toilet paper as this stuff\r\nwe're using for money. Sooner. Toilet paper can be used for something,\r\nand this paper money's too stiff. Maybe some of this stuff we're\r\ndigging here isn't worth much, but at least it's real.\"\r\n\r\nThat was something else the Maxwell Plan would have to take care of.\r\nGresham's Law was running hog-wild on Poictesme. A Planetary\r\nGovernment sol was worth about ten centisols, Federation, and aside\r\nfrom deposit boxes, woolen socks under the mattress, and tin cans\r\nburied in the corner of the cellar, Federation currency was\r\nnonexistent.\r\n\r\n\"Had breakfast yet?\" Rodney Maxwell asked.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, hours ago. I was out and shot another spikenose; it's hanging up\r\nback of the kitchen, waiting for the cook to skin it and cut it up.\"\r\nHe grinned at Conn. \"You don't get this kind of hunting in a bank,\r\neither.\"\r\n\r\n\"Jerry still inside? I want to see him. Suppose you take Conn around\r\nand show him the sights. And don't worry about him bumping you out of\r\na job. Worry about the six or eight extra jobs you'll have to do\r\nbesides your own, from now on.\"\r\n\r\nConn and Anse crossed the yard and entered one of the office\r\nbuildings, through a big breach in the wall. Anse said: \"I did that\r\nmyself; 90-mm tank gun. When we want a wall out of the way, we get it\r\nout of the way.\" Inside were a lot of lifters and skids and power\r\nshovels and things; laborers were assembling for work assignments.\r\nMost of them had been with his father six years ago and he knew them.\r\nThey hadn't done any growing up in the meantime. They climbed into an\r\nairjeep and floated out over the edge of the plateau, letting down\r\npast the sheer cliff to where the lower lateral shaft had been opened.\r\nA great deal of rock had been shoveled and bulldozed away to expose\r\nit; it was twenty feet high and forty wide. Anse simply steered the\r\njeep inside and up the tunnel.\r\n\r\nThere were occasional lights on at the ceiling. Anse said they were\r\nall powered from their own nuclear-electric conversion units. \"We\r\ndon't have the central power on here; there's a big mass-energy\r\nconverter, but we're tearing it down to ship out.\"\r\n\r\nThat was something they could get a good price for. Maybe even\r\none-tenth of what it was worth. At least they wouldn't have to sell it\r\nby the ton.\r\n\r\nThe tunnel ended in an enormous room a couple of hundred feet square\r\nand fifty high. There was a wide aisle up the middle; on either side,\r\ncontragravity equipment was massed. Tanks with long 90-mm guns. Combat\r\ncars. Small airboats. Rank on rank of air-cavalry single-mounts,\r\negg-shaped things just big enough for a man to sit in, with quadruple\r\nmachine guns in front and flame-jets behind. Ambulances armored\r\nagainst radiation; decontamination units; mobile workshops; mobile\r\nkitchens. Troop carriers, jeeps, staff cars; power shovels,\r\nmanipulators, lifters. All waiting, for forty years, to swarm out as\r\nsoon as the bombs that never came stopped falling.\r\n\r\nThey floated the jeep along hallways beyond, and got down to look into\r\nrooms. Work was already going on in the power plant; a gang under a\r\nslim young man whom Anse introduced as Mohammed Matsui were using\r\nrepair-robots to get canisters of live plutonium out of a reactor.\r\nWorkshops. Laundries. Storerooms. Kitchens, some stripped and a few\r\nstill intact. A hospital. Guardhouse and lockup.\r\n\r\nMore storerooms on the level above, reached by returning to the\r\nvehicle hangar and lifting to an upper entrance. By this time, gangs\r\nwere at work there, too, moving contragravity skids in empty and out\r\nloaded.\r\n\r\n\"The CO here must have had squirrel blood,\" Anse said. \"I think when\r\nthe evacuation orders came through he just gathered up everything\r\nthere was topside and crammed it down here, any old way. Honest to\r\nGhu, this place was packed solid when we found it. Nobody'd believe\r\nit.\"\r\n\r\n\"Wait till you see the next one.\"\r\n\r\n\"You mean there's another place like this?\"\r\n\r\n\"You can say so. You can say a twenty-megaton thermonuclear is like a\r\nhand grenade, too.\"\r\n\r\nAnse Dawes simply didn't believe that.\r\n\r\nWhen they got back to the Administration Building on top, they found\r\nRodney Maxwell, Jerry Rivas, the general foremen, and half a dozen\r\ngang foremen, in consultation.\r\n\r\n\"We're getting a hundred and fifty more men and ten farm scows from\r\nLitchfield,\" his father said. \"Dave McCade's coming out from our yard,\r\nand Tom Brangwyn's sending one of his deputies to help boss them. Well\r\nhave to keep an eye on this crowd; they're all Tramptown hoodlums, but\r\nthat's the best we can get. We're going to have to get this place\r\ncleaned out in a hurry. We only have about two weeks till the\r\nwine-pressing's over, and then we want to start the next operation.\r\nConn, did you see all that engineering equipment, down on the bottom\r\nlevel?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. I think we ought to leave a lot of that here--the shovels and\r\nbulldozers and manipulators and so on. We can move it direct to Force\r\nCommand. How are we fixed for blasting explosives?\"\r\n\r\n\"Name it and we have it. Cataclysmite, FJ-7, anything you want.\"\r\n\r\n\"We'll need a lot of it.\"\r\n\r\n\"We're going to have to get a ship. I mean a contragravity ship, a\r\nfreighter; first, to move this stuff out of here, and then to move the\r\nstuff out of Force Command. And we want it mounted with heavy\r\narmament, too. We not only want a freighter, we want a fighting ship.\"\r\n\r\n\"You think so?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm sure of it,\" Rodney Maxwell said. \"Where we're going is full of\r\noutlaws; there must be hundreds of them holing up over there. That's\r\nwhere all the trouble on the east coast comes from. Now, outlaws are\r\nsure-thing players. They want to be alive to spend their loot, and\r\nthey won't tackle anything that's too tough for them. A lot of guards\r\nand combat equipment may look like a loss on the books, but the books\r\nwon't show how much of a loss you might take if you didn't have them.\r\nI want this operation armed till it'll be too much for all the outlaws\r\non the planet to tackle.\"\r\n\r\nThat made sense. It also made sense out of the billions of sols the\r\nFederation had spent preparing for an invasion that never came. If it\r\nhad come and found them unprepared, the loss might have been the war\r\nitself.\r\n\r\nThe scows and the newly hired workers began arriving a little after\r\nnoon. The scows had been borrowed from plantations where the crop\r\nhad been gotten in; there were melon leaves and bits of vine in\r\nthe bottoms. The workers were a bleary-eyed and unsavory lot;\r\nConn had a suspicion, which Brangwyn's deputy confirmed, that\r\nthey had been collected by mass vagrancy arrests in Tramptown.\r\nAs soon as they started arriving, Jerry Rivas hurried down to\r\nthe old provost-marshal's headquarters and came back with a lot\r\nof rubber billy-clubs, which he issued to his gang-bosses, regular\r\nand temporary. A few times they had to be used. By evening, however,\r\nthe insubordinate and troublesome had been quieted. They would all\r\nsteal anything they could put in their pockets, but that was to be\r\nexpected. By evening, too, the contents of the underground treasure\r\ntrove was moving out in a steady stream, and scows were shuttling to\r\nand from Litchfield.\r\n\r\nRodney Maxwell was going back to town after lunch the next day. Conn\r\nwanted to know if he should go along.\r\n\r\n\"No, you stay here; help keep things moving. Remember what I told you\r\nabout the older and wiser heads? Let me handle them. I've been around\r\nthem, heaven pity me, longer than you have. Just give me an\r\naudiovisual of your proxy and I'll vote your stock.\"\r\n\r\n\"How much stock do I have, by the way?\"\r\n\r\n\"The same as I have--ten thousand five hundred shares of common, at\r\ntwenty centisols a share. But watch where it goes after we open Force\r\nCommand.\"\r\n\r\nHis father was back, two days later, to report:\r\n\r\n\"We're organized. Kurt Fawzi's president, of course, and does he love\r\nit. That'll keep him out of mischief. Dolf Kellton's secretary; he has\r\nan office force at the Academy and can conscript students to help.\r\nHe's organizing a research team from his seniors and post-grad\r\nstudents to work in the Planetary Library at Storisende. There are a\r\nlot of old Third Force records there; he may find something useful. Of\r\ncourse, Lester Dawes is treasurer.\"\r\n\r\n\"What are you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Vice-president in charge of operations. That's what I spent all\r\nyesterday log-rolling, baby-kissing and cigar-passing to get.\"\r\n\r\n\"And what am I, if it's a fair question?\"\r\n\r\n\"You have a very distinguished position; you are a non-office-holding\r\nstockholder. The only other one is Judge Ledue; as a member of the\r\njudiciary, he did not feel it proper to accept official position in a\r\nprivate corporation. Tom Brangwyn's Chief of Company Police; Klem\r\nFawzi is Commander of the Company Guards. And we have a law firm in\r\nStorisende lined up to handle our charter application. Sterber, Flynn\r\n& Chen-Wong. Sterber's married to Jake Vyckhoven's sister, Flynn's son\r\nis married to the daughter of the Secretary of the Treasury, and\r\nChen-Wong is a nephew of the Chief Justice. All of them are directly\r\ndescended from members of Genji Gartner's original crew.\"\r\n\r\n\"You don't anticipate any trouble about getting the charter?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not exactly. And Lester Dawes is in Storisende now, trying to find us\r\na contragravity ship. There are about a dozen in the hands of\r\nreceivers for bankrupt shipping companies; he might find one that's\r\nstill airworthy. Oh; you remember how I insisted on absolute secrecy\r\nabout our Merlin objective? That's working out better than my fondest\r\nexpectations. It's leaking like a machine-gunned water tank, and\r\neverybody it leaks to is positive that we know exactly where Merlin is\r\nor we wouldn't be trying to keep it a secret.\"\r\n\r\nThree days later, Conn hitched a ride on a freight-scow to Litchfield.\r\nFrom the air, he could see a haze of bonfire smoke over High Garden\r\nTerrace, and a gang of men at work. There were more men at work on the\r\nMall and along the streets on either side. He went up from the yard\r\nbelow the house, where the scow was being unloaded, and found his\r\nmother in the living room watching a screen play with one eye and\r\nkeeping the other on a soulless machine like a miniature contragravity\r\ntank, which was going over the carpet with a vacuum cleaner and taking\r\nswipes at the furniture with a rotary dustmop. She was glad to see\r\nhim, and then became troubled.\r\n\r\n\"Conn, when Flora comes home, you won't argue with her, will you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Only in self-defense.\" That was the wrong thing to say. He changed it\r\nto, \"No; I won't argue with her at all,\" and then quoted Wade Lucas\r\nquoting Thomas Paine. Then he had to assure his mother a couple of\r\ntimes that there really was a Merlin, and then assure her that it\r\nwouldn't get loose and hurt anybody if he did find it.\r\n\r\nIn the middle of his assurances about the harmlessness of Merlin, the\r\nhousecleaning-robot began knocking things off the top of a table.\r\n\r\n\"Oscar! You stop that!\" his mother yelled.\r\n\r\nOscar, deaf as the adder, kept on. Conn yelled at his mother to use\r\nher control; she remembered that she had one, a thing like an\r\nold-fashioned pocket watch, around her neck on a chain, and got the\r\nrobot stopped.\r\n\r\nNo wonder she was afraid of Merlin.\r\n\r\nHe took advantage of the interruption to get to his room and change\r\nclothes, then went up to the hangar and got out an air-cavalry mount.\r\nAbout fifty men were working on High Garden Terrace, pruning and\r\ntrimming and leveling the lawns. There was a big vitrifier on the\r\nMall--even at five hundred feet he could feel the heat from\r\nit--chuffing and clanking and pouring lavalike molten rock for a new\r\npavement. And all the nymphs and satyrs and dryads and fauns and\r\ncentaurs had had their pedestals rebuilt and were sand-blasted clean.\r\n\r\nHe landed on the top of the Airlines Building and rode a lift down to\r\nthe office where Kurt Fawzi neglected the affairs of his shipline\r\nagency, his brokerage business, and the city of Litchfield. The\r\nafternoon habitues had begun to gather--Raymond Fitch, the\r\nused-vehicles dealer, Lorenzo Menardes, Judge Ledue, Tom Brangwyn,\r\nKlem Zareff. Fawzi was on the screen, talking to somebody with sandy\r\nhair and a suit that didn't seem to be made of any sort of Federation\r\nArmed Forces material, about warehouse facilities. The addresses they\r\nwere mentioning were in Storisende.\r\n\r\n\"No, Leo, I don't know when,\" Fawzi was saying, \"but don't you worry.\r\nYou just have space for it, and we'll fill it up. And don't ask me\r\nwhat sort of stuff. You know what a salvage operation's like; you just\r\nhaul out the stuff as you come to it.\"\r\n\r\nTom Brangwyn, lounging in one of the deep chairs, looked up.\r\n\r\n\"Hello, Conn. We're having a time. Another two hundred tramps came in\r\non the _Countess_ this morning, and Ghu only knows how many in their\r\nown vehicles, and they all seem to think if there's work for some\r\nthere ought to be work for all, and some of them are getting nasty.\"\r\n\r\n\"We can use some more out at the dig. The ones you sent out Thursday\r\nare doing all right, once they found out we weren't taking any\r\nfoolishness.\"\r\n\r\nFawzi turned away from the screen. \"Well, Conn, we're in,\" he said.\r\n\"The charter was granted this morning; now we're Litchfield\r\nExploration & Salvage, Ltd. And Lester Dawes has found us a\r\ncontragravity ship.\"\r\n\r\n\"How much will it cost us?\"\r\n\r\nFawzi began to laugh. \"Conn, this'll slay you! She isn't costing us a\r\ncentisol. You know those old ships on Mothball Row, back of the old\r\nWest End ship docks at Storisende?\"\r\n\r\nConn nodded. He'd seen them before he had gone away, and from the\r\n\r\n_City of Asgard_ coming in--a lot of old Army Transport craft, covered\r\nwith muslin and sprayed with protectoplast. The Planetary Government\r\nhad taken them over after the War and forgotten them.\r\n\r\n\"Well, Lester's getting one of them for us under the old 878\r\nCommercial Enterprise Encouragement Act. She's an Army combat\r\nfreighter, regimental ammunition ship. Of course, she still has\r\narmament; we'll have to pay to get that off.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why?\"\r\n\r\nFawzi looked at him in surprise. \"It would only be in the way and add\r\nweight. We want her for a cargo ship, don't we?\"\r\n\r\n\"That's what she was built for. What kind of armament?\"\r\n\r\nFawzi didn't know. Klem Zareff did.\r\n\r\n\"Four 115-mm rifles, two fore and two aft. A pair of lift-and-drive\r\nmissile launchers amidships. And a secondary gun battery of 70-mm's\r\nand 50-mm auto-cannon. I know the class; we captured a few of them.\r\nGood ships.\"\r\n\r\nFawzi was horrified. \"Why, that's more firepower than the whole Air\r\nPatrol. Look, the Government won't like our having anything like\r\nthat.\"\r\n\r\n\"They're giving her to us, aren't they?\" Menardes asked.\r\n\r\n\"Gehenna with what the Government likes!\" the old Rebel swore. \"If\r\nthey'd put a few of those ships into commission, they could wipe out\r\nthese outlaws and a private company wouldn't need an armed ship.\"\r\n\r\n\"May I use your screen, Kurt?\" Conn asked.\r\n\r\nWhen Fawzi nodded, he punched out the combination of the operating\r\noffice at Tenth Army, and finally got his father on. He told him about\r\nthe ship.\r\n\r\n\"There's talk about tearing the armament out,\" he added.\r\n\r\n\"Is that so, now? Well, I'll call Lester Dawes before he can get\r\nstarted on it. I think I'll go in to Storisende tomorrow and see the\r\nship for myself. See what I can do about ammunition for those guns,\r\ntoo.\"\r\n\r\n\"But, Rod,\" Fawzi protested, joining the conversation, \"we don't want\r\nto start a war.\"\r\n\r\n\"No. We want to stay out of one. You don't do that by disarming. We're\r\ntaking that ship down into the Badlands. Remember?\" Rodney Maxwell\r\nsaid. \"Ever hear the name Blackie Perales?\"\r\n\r\nFawzi had. He stopped arguing about armament. Instead, he began\r\nworrying about how much the civic clean-up campaign was costing\r\nLitchfield.\r\n\r\n\"You think we really need that, Rod?\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course we do. You'd be surprised how much labor we're going to\r\nneed, and how hard up we're going to be for capable supervisors. This\r\nthing's a training program, Kurt, and we'll need every man we train on\r\nit.\"\r\n\r\n\"But it's costing like Nifflheim, Rod. We're going to bankrupt the\r\ncity.\"\r\n\r\n\"Worse than it is now, you mean? Oh, don't worry, Kurt. As soon as we\r\nfind Merlin, everything'll be all right.\"\r\n\r\nFranz Veltrin came in, shortly after Rodney Maxwell was off the\r\nscreen. He dropped his audiovisual camera and sound recorder on the\r\ntable, laid his pistol-belt on top of them and took a drink of brandy,\r\ndowning it with the audible satisfaction of a thirsty horse at a\r\ntrough. Then he looked around accusingly.\r\n\r\n\"Somebody's been talking!\" he declared. \"I've had all the news\r\nservices on the planet on my screen today; they all want the story\r\nabout what's happening here. They've heard we know where Merlin is;\r\nthat Conn Maxwell found out on Terra.\"\r\n\r\n\"They just put two and two together and threw seven,\" Conn said. \"A\r\n_Herald-Guardian_ ship-news reporter interviewed me when I got in, and\r\nfound out I'd been studying cybernetics and computer theory on Terra.\r\nWhat did you tell them?\"\r\n\r\n\"Complete denial. We don't know a thing about Merlin. Naturally, they\r\ndidn't believe me. A bunch of them are coming out here tomorrow. What\r\nare we going to tell them? We'll all have to have the same story.\"\r\n\r\n\"I,\" said Judge Ledue, \"am not going to be interviewed, I am leaving\r\ntown till they're gone.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why don't you steer them onto Wade Lucas?\" Conn asked. \"If you want\r\nanything denied, he'll do it for you.\"\r\n\r\nEverybody thought that was a wonderful idea, except Klem Zareff, and\r\nhe waited until Conn was ready to go and rode up to the landing stage\r\nwith him.\r\n\r\n\"Conn, I know this Lucas is going to marry your sister,\" he began,\r\n\"but how much do you know about him?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not much. He seems like a nice chap. I don't hold what he said at the\r\nmeeting against him. I suppose if I'd come from off-planet, I wouldn't\r\nbelieve in Merlin either.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hah! But doesn't he believe in Merlin?\"\r\n\r\n\"He makes noises like it.\"\r\n\r\n\"You know what I think?\" Klem Zareff lowered his voice to a whisper.\r\n\"I think he's a Federation spy! I think the Federation's lost Merlin.\r\nThat's why they haven't come back to get it long ago.\"\r\n\r\n\"Pretty big thing to mislay.\"\r\n\r\n\"It could happen. There'd only be a few scientists and some high staff\r\nofficers who'd know where it was. Well, say they all went back to\r\nTerra on the same ship, and the ship was lost at space. Sabotage, one\r\nof our commerce raiders that hadn't heard the War was over, maybe just\r\nan ordinary accident. But the ship's lost, and the location of\r\nMerlin's lost with her.\"\r\n\r\n\"That could happen,\" Conn agreed seriously.\r\n\r\n\"All right. So ever since, they've had people here, listening,\r\nwatching, spying. This Lucas; he showed up here about a year after you\r\nwent to Terra. And who does he get engaged to? Your sister. And what\r\ndoes he do here? Goes around arguing that there is no Merlin, getting\r\npeople to argue with him, getting them mad, so they'll blurt out\r\nanything they know. I'm an old field officer; I know all the\r\nprisoner-interrogation tricks in the book, and that's always been one\r\nof the best.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then why did he act the way he did at the meeting? All he did there\r\nwas cut himself off from learning anything more from any of us. In his\r\nplace, would you have done that? No; you'd have tried to take the lead\r\nin hunting for Merlin yourself. Now wouldn't you?\"\r\n\r\nZareff was silent, first puzzled, and then hurt. Now he would have to\r\ntear the whole idea down and build it over.\r\n\r\nFlora was quite friendly when she came home from school. She'd found\r\nout, somewhere, that Conn had been the originator of the municipal\r\nface-lifting project. He was tempted, briefly, to tell her a little,\r\nif not all, of the truth about the Maxwell Plan, then decided against\r\nit. The way to keep a secret was to confide it to nobody; every time\r\nyou did, you doubled, maybe even squared, the chances of exposure.\r\n\r\nHe told his father, when Rodney Maxwell came in from the dig, about\r\nhis talk with Klem Zareff.\r\n\r\n\"How long's he been like that, anyhow?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"As long as I've known him. When it comes to melons and wine and\r\nbossing tramp labor and taking care of his money and coming in out of\r\nthe rain, Klem Zareff's as sane as I am. But on the subject of the\r\nTerran Federation, he's crazy as a bedbug. What is a bedbug, anyhow?\"\r\n\r\n\"They have them on Terra, in places like Tramptown. They have places\r\nlike Tramptown on Terra, too.\"\r\n\r\n\"Uhuh. I suppose, in Klem's boots, I'd be just as crazy as he is,\"\r\nRodney Maxwell said. \"One minute, he had a wife and two children in\r\nKindelburg, on Ashmodai, and the next minute Kindelburg was a puddle\r\nof radioactive slag.\"\r\n\r\n\"That was in '51, wasn't it? I read about it,\" Conn said. \"It was a\r\nfamous victory.\"\r\n\r\nThat was from a poem, too.\r\n\r\nRodney Maxwell flew to Storisende early the next morning. Conn rode\r\nback to Tenth Army on an empty scow and pitched into the job of\r\ngetting the stores and equipment out of the underground shelters. More\r\nfarm-tramps arrived, and had to be pounded into obedience and taught\r\nthe work. At the same time, Litchfield was getting a steady influx of\r\njob-seekers, and a secondary swarm of thugs, grifters and gangsters\r\nwho followed them. Klem Zareff, having gotten all his melons pressed,\r\ncame out to Tenth Army, where he selected fifty of the best men from\r\nthe work-gangs and began drilling them as soldiers to guard the next\r\noperation. The manual of arms, drill and salute he taught them was, of\r\ncourse, System States Alliance.\r\n\r\nA week later, the ship arrived from Storisende; a hundred and sixty\r\nfeet, three thousand tons, small enough to be berthed inside a\r\nhyperspace transport, and fast enough to get a load of ammunition to\r\ntroops at the front, unload, and get out again before the enemy could\r\nzero in on her, and armed to fight off any Army Air Force combat\r\ncraft. The delay had been in recruiting officers and crew. The captain\r\nand chief engineer were out-of-work shipline officers, the gunner was\r\na former Federation artillery officer, and the crew looked more like\r\npirates than most pirates did.\r\n\r\nThey christened her the _Lester Dawes_, because Dawes had secured her\r\nand because the name began with the initials of Litchfield Exploration &\r\nSalvage. From then on, it was a race to see whether the Tenth Army\r\nattack-shelters would be emptied before the wine was all pressed, or\r\nvice versa.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVII\r\n\r\n\r\nFifty-two years before, they had come to the mesa in the Badlands and\r\ndug a pit on top of it, a thousand feet in diameter and more than five\r\nhundred deep, and in it they built a duplicate of the headquarters for\r\nThird Fleet-Army Force Command. They built a shaft a hundred feet in\r\ndiameter like a chimney at one side, and they ran a tunnel out through\r\nsolid rock to the head of a canyon half a mile away. Then they buried\r\nthe whole thing. Twelve years later, when the War was over, they\r\nsealed both entrances and went away and left it.\r\n\r\nFor a month each winter, cold rains from the east lashed the desert;\r\nfor the rest of the year, it was swept by windblown sand. Wiregrass\r\nsprouted, and thornbush grew; Nature, the master-camoufleur, completed\r\nthe work of hiding the forgotten headquarters. Little things not\r\nunlike rabbits scampered over it, and bigger things, vaguely foxlike,\r\nhunted them. Hunted men came, too, their aircars skimming low. None of\r\nthem had the least idea what was underneath.\r\n\r\nThe mesa-top came suddenly to life, just as the sun edged up out of\r\nthe east. Conn and his father and Anse Dawes came in first, in the\r\nrecon-car with which they had scouted and photographed the site a few\r\ndays before. They circled at a thousand feet, fired a smoke bomb, and\r\nthen let down near where Conn's map showed the head of the vertical\r\nshaft. The rest followed, first a couple of combat cars that circled\r\nslowly, scanning the ground, and then the _Lester Dawes_ with her big\r\nguns and her load of equipment, and behind a queue of boats and scows\r\nand heavy engineering equipment on contragravity and troop carriers\r\nfull of workmen and guards, flanked by air cavalry, which circled\r\nabove while everything else landed, then scattered out over a\r\nfifty-mile radius. Occasionally there was a hammering of machine guns,\r\neither because somebody saw something on the ground that might need\r\nshooting at or simply because it was a beautiful morning to make a\r\nnoise.\r\n\r\nThe ship settled quickly and daintily, while Conn and Anse and Rodney\r\nMaxwell sat in the car and watched. Immediately, she began opening\r\nlike a beetle bursting from its shell, large sections of armor\r\nswinging outward. Except for the bridge and the gun turrets, almost\r\nthe whole ship could be opened; she had been designed to land in the\r\nmiddle of a battle and deliver ammunition when seconds could mean the\r\ndifference between life and death. Jeeps and lifters and manipulators\r\nand things floated out of her. Scows began landing and unloading\r\nprefab-hut elements. A water tank landed, and the cook-shed began\r\ngoing up beside it; a lorry came in with scanning and probing\r\nequipment, and a couple of men jumped off and huddled over a\r\nphotoprint copy of one of Conn's maps.\r\n\r\nConn lifted the car again and coasted it half a mile to where the\r\ncleft in the mesa started. There were half a dozen claw-armed\r\nmanipulators already there, and two giant power shovels. Jerry Rivas\r\nand one of the engineers Kurt Fawzi had hired had gotten out of a jeep\r\nand were looking at another photoprint of the map. Rivas pointed to\r\nthe head of the canyon, where a mass of rock had slid down.\r\n\r\n\"That's it; you can still see where they put off the shots.\"\r\n\r\nThe canyon was long enough and wide enough for the _Lester Dawes_\r\nto land in it; she could be loaded directly from the tunnel. The\r\nmanipulators began moving in, wrestling with the larger chunks of\r\nrock and dragging or carrying them away. Power shovels began grunting\r\nand clanking and rumbling; dust rose in a thick column. Toward\r\nmidmorning, the troop carriers which served as school buses in\r\nLitchfield arrived, loaded with more workmen. A lorry lettered\r\nSTORISENDE HERALD-GUARDIAN came in, hovered over the canyon, and\r\nbegan transmitting audiovisuals. More news-folk put in an appearance.\r\n\r\nThe earth and rock at the top of the tunnel entrance fell away,\r\nrevealing the vitrified stone lintel; everybody cheered and dug\r\nharder. More aircars arrived, getting in each other's and everybody\r\nelse's way. Raymond Fitch, Lester Dawes, Lorenzo Menardes and Morgan\r\nGatworth. Dolf Kellton, playing hookey from school. Kurt Fawzi; he\r\nlanded in the canyon and watched every shovelful of rock lifted, as\r\nthough trying to help with mental force. Tom Brangwyn, with a score of\r\nthe Home Guard to reinforce the Company Police. Klem Zareff called in\r\nhis air cavalry to help control the sightseers. Nobody was making\r\ntrouble; they were just getting in the way.\r\n\r\nAt eleven, Rodney Maxwell went aboard the _Lester Dawes_ to use the\r\nradio and telescreen equipment. By then, two time zones west in\r\nStorisende, the Claims Office was opening; he filed preliminary claim\r\nto an underground installation with at least two entrances in\r\nuninhabited country, and claimed a ten-mile radius around it. By that\r\ntime, the gang working on top had uncovered a vitrified slab over the\r\nhundred-foot circle of the vertical shaft and were cracking it with\r\nexplosives. According to the scanners, it was full of loose rubble for\r\na hundred feet down. Below that, the microrays hit something\r\nimpenetrable.\r\n\r\nToward midafternoon, the tunnel in the canyon was cleared. It had been\r\nvitrified solid; the scanners reported that it was plugged for ten\r\nfeet. A contragravity tank let down in front of it, with a solenoid\r\njackhammer mounted where the gun should have been, and began pounding,\r\nrunning a hole in for a blast shot. There were more explosions\r\ntopside; when Conn took a jeep up to observe progress there, he found\r\nthe vitrified rock blown completely off the vertical shaft, exposing\r\nthe rubble that had been dumped into it. The gang on the mesa-top had\r\ndiscovered something else; a grid of auro-copper bussbars buried four\r\nfeet underground. Ten to one, radio and telescreen signals would be\r\ntransmitted to that from below, and then probably picked up and\r\nrebroadcast from a relay station on one or another of the high buttes\r\nin the neighborhood. Time enough to look for that later. He returned\r\nto the canyon, where the lateral tunnel was now almost completely\r\nopen.\r\n\r\nWhen it was clear, they sent a snooper in first. It was a robot,\r\nlooking slightly like a short-tailed tadpole, six feet long by three\r\nfeet at the thickest. It transmitted a view of the tunnel as it went\r\nslowly in; the air, it found, was breathable, and there were no\r\nharmful radiations or other dangers. According to the plans, there\r\nshould be a big room at the other end, slightly curved, a hundred feet\r\nwide by a hundred on either side of the tunnel entrance. The robot\r\nentered this, and in its headlight they could see reconnaissance-cars,\r\nand contragravity tanks with 90-mm guns. It swerved slightly to the\r\nleft, and then the screen stopped receiving, the telemetered\r\ninstruments went dead and the robot's signal stopped.\r\n\r\n\"Tom,\" Rodney Maxwell said, \"you keep the crowd back. Klem, stay with\r\nthe screens; I'll transmit to you. I'm going in to see what's wrong.\"\r\n\r\nHe started to give Conn an argument when he wanted to accompany him.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" Conn said. \"I'm going along. What do you think I went to Terra\r\nto study robotics for?\"\r\n\r\nHis father snapped on the screen and pickup of the jeep that was\r\nstanding nearby. \"You getting it, Klem?\" he asked. \"Okay, Conn. Let's\r\ngo.\"\r\n\r\nHalf a mile ahead, at the other end of the tunnel, they could see a\r\nflicker of light that grew brighter as they advanced. The snooper\r\nstill had its light on and was moving about. Once they caught a\r\nmomentary signal from it. As Rodney Maxwell piloted the jeep, Conn\r\nkept talking to Klem Zareff, outside. Then they were at the end of the\r\ntunnel and entering the room ahead; it was full of vehicles, like the\r\none on the bottom level at Tenth Army HQ. As soon as they were inside,\r\nKlem Zareff's voice in the radio stopped, as though the set had been\r\nshot out.\r\n\r\n\"Klem! What's wrong? We aren't getting you,\" his father was saying.\r\n\r\nThe snooper was drifting aimlessly about, avoiding the parked\r\nvehicles. Conn used the manual control to set it down and deactivate\r\nit, then got out and went to examine it.\r\n\r\n\"Take the jeep over to the tunnel entrance,\" he told his father.\r\n\"Move out into the tunnel a few feet; relay from me to Klem.\"\r\n\r\nThe jeep moved over. A moment later his father cried, \"He's getting\r\nme; I'm getting him. What's the matter with the radio in here? The\r\nsnooper's all right, isn't it?\"\r\n\r\nIt was. Conn reactivated it and put it up above the tops of the\r\nvehicles.\r\n\r\n\"Sure. We just can't transmit out.\"\r\n\r\n\"But only half a mile of rock; that set's good for more than that.\r\nIt'll transmit clear through Snagtooth.\"\r\n\r\n\"It won't transmit through collapsium.\"\r\n\r\nHis father swore disgustedly, repeating it to Zareff outside. Conn\r\ncould hear the old soldier, in the radio, make a similar remark. They\r\nshould have all expected that, in the first place. If the Third Force\r\nHigh Command was expecting to sit out a nuclear bombardment in this\r\nplace, they'd armor it against anything.\r\n\r\n\"Bring the gang in; it's safe as far as we've gotten,\" his father\r\nsaid. \"We'll just have to string wires out.\"\r\n\r\nConn used his flashlight and found the power unit for the room lights;\r\nall the overhead lights were wired to one unit, if wired were the word\r\nfor gold-leaf circuits cemented to the walls and covered with\r\ninsulating paint. For the heavy stuff, like the ventilator fans,\r\nthey'd have to find the central power plant. He looked around the big\r\nroom, poking into some of the closets that lined it. Radiation-proof\r\nclothing. Tools. Arms and ammunition. First-aid kits. Emergency\r\nrations. All the vehicles were plated in shimmering collapsium.\r\n\r\nThe crowd started coming in: the work-gangs selected for the first\r\nexploration work, most of them old hands of Rodney Maxwell's; the\r\nengineers they had recruited; Mohammed Matsui--he had a gang of his\r\nown, the same one he had been using in tearing down the converter at\r\nTenth Army; the stockholders and officials; the press. And everybody\r\nelse Tom Brangwyn's police hadn't been able to keep out.\r\n\r\nThe power plant was at the extreme bottom; Matsui began looking it over\r\nat once. Above it they found the service facilities--air-and-water\r\nplant; pumps for the artesian well; sewage disposal. Then repair ships,\r\nand a laboratory, and laundries and kitchens above that.\r\n\r\n\"Where do you suppose it is?\" Kurt Fawzi was asking. \"Up at the very\r\ntop, I suppose. Let's go up and work down; I can't wait till we've\r\nfound it.\"\r\n\r\nLike a kid on Christmas Eve, Conn thought. And there was no Santa\r\nClaus, and Christmas had been abolished.\r\n\r\nThe place was built in concentric circles, level above level. Combat\r\nequipment nearest the tunnel exit and nearest the vertical shaft, and\r\nambulances and decontamination units and equipment for relief and\r\nrebuilding next. Storerooms, mile on circular mile of them. Not the\r\nhasty packrat cramming he'd seen at Tenth Army; everything had been\r\nbrought in in order, carefully piled or racked, and then left. More\r\nstores for the next three levels up; then living quarters. Enlisted\r\nmen's and women's quarters, no signs of occupancy. Enlisted kitchens\r\nand mess halls, untouched.\r\n\r\nMost of the officers' quarters were similarly unused, but here and\r\nthere some had been occupied. A sloppily made bed. A used cake of soap\r\nin the bathroom. An empty bottle in a closet. Officers' commissary\r\nstores had been used from and replaced; the officers' mess hall and\r\nkitchen had been in constant use, and the officers' club had a\r\ncomfortably scuffed and lived-in look. There had been a few people\r\nthere all the time of the War.\r\n\r\n\"Men and women, all officers or civilians,\" Klem Zareff said. \"Didn't\r\neven have enlisted men to cook for them. And we haven't found a scrap\r\nof paper with writing on it, or an inch of recorded sound-tape or\r\naudiovisual film. Remember those big wire baskets, down at the\r\nmass-energy converters? Before they left, they disintegrated every\r\nscrap of writing or recording. This is where Merlin is; they were the\r\npeople who worked with it.\"\r\n\r\nAnd above, offices. General Staff. War Planning, with an incredibly\r\ncomplex star-map of the theater of war. Judge Advocate General.\r\nInspector General. Service of Supply. They were full of computers,\r\neach one firing the hopes of people like Fawzi and Dolf Kellton and\r\nJudge Ledue, but they were only special-purpose machines, the sort to\r\nbe found in any big business office. The Storisende Stock Exchange\r\nprobably had much bigger ones.\r\n\r\nThen they found big ones, rank on rank of cabinets, long consoles\r\nstudded with lights and buttons, programming machines.\r\n\r\n\"It's Merlin!\" Fawzi almost screamed. \"We've found it!\"\r\n\r\nOne of the reporters who had followed them in snatched his radio\r\nhandphone from his belt and jabbered, then, realizing that the\r\ncollapsium shielding kept him from getting out with it, he replaced it\r\nand bolted away.\r\n\r\n\"Hold it!\" Conn yelled at the others, who were also becoming\r\nhysterical. \"Wait till I take a look at this thing.\"\r\n\r\nThey managed to calm themselves. After all, he should know what it\r\nwas; wasn't that why he'd gone to school on Terra? They followed him\r\nfrom machine to machine, first hopefully and then fearfully. Finally\r\nhe turned, shaking his head and feeling like the doctor in a film\r\nshow, telling the family that there's no hope for Grandpa.\r\n\r\n\"This is not Merlin. This is the personnel-file machine. It's taped\r\nfor the records and data of every man and woman in the Third Force for\r\nthe whole War. It's like the student-record machine at the\r\nUniversity.\"\r\n\r\n\"Might have known it; this section in here's marked G-1 all over\r\neverything; that's personnel. Wouldn't have Merlin in here,\" Klem\r\nZareff was saying.\r\n\r\n\"Well, we'll just keep on hunting for it till we do find it,\" Kurt\r\nFawzi said. \"It's here somewhere. It has to be.\"\r\n\r\nThe next level up was much smaller. Here were the offices of the top\r\nechelons of the Force Command Staff. They, unlike the ones below, had\r\nbeen used; from them, too, every scrap of writing or film or\r\nrecord-tape had vanished.\r\n\r\nFinally, they entered the private office of Force-General Foxx Travis.\r\nIt had not only been used, it was in disorder. Ashtrays full, many of\r\nthe forty-year-old cigarette ends lipstick tinted. Chairs shoved\r\naround at random. Three bottles on the desk, with Terran bourbon\r\nlabels; two empty and one with about an inch of whisky left in it. But\r\nno glasses.\r\n\r\nThat bothered Conn. Somehow, he couldn't quite picture the commander\r\nand staff of the Third Fleet-Army Force passing bottles around and\r\ndrinking from the neck. Then he noticed that the wall across the room\r\nwas strangely scarred and scratched. Dropping his eye to the floor\r\nunder it, he caught the twinkle of broken glass. They had gathered\r\nhere, and talked for a long time. Then they had risen, for a final\r\ntoast, and when it was drunk, they had hurled their glasses against\r\nthe wall and smashed them.\r\n\r\nThen they had gone out, leaving the broken glass and the empty\r\nbottles; knowing that they would never return.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore they returned to the lower level into which the lateral tunnel\r\nentered, Matsui and his gang had the power plant going; the ventilator\r\nfans were humming softly, and whenever they pressed a starting button,\r\nthe escalators began to move. They got the pumps going, and the\r\noxygen-generators, and the sewage disposal system. Until the\r\ncommunication center could be checked and the relay station found,\r\nthey ran a cable out to the _Lester Dawes_, landed in the canyon, and\r\nused her screen-and-radio equipment. Before the Claims Office in\r\nStorisende closed, Rodney Maxwell had transmitted in recorded views of\r\nthe interior, and enough of a description for a final claim. They also\r\nreceived teleprint copies of the Storisende papers. The first story,\r\nin an extra edition of the _Herald-Guardian_, was headlined,\r\nMERLIN FOUND! That would have been the reporter who bolted\r\noff prematurely when they first saw the personnel record machines.\r\nConn wondered if he still had a job. A later edition corrected this,\r\nbut was full of extravagant accounts of what had been discovered.\r\nMerlin or no Merlin, Force Command Duplicate was the biggest\r\nabandoned-property discovery since the Third Force left the\r\nTrisystem.\r\n\r\nThe camp they had set up on top of the mesa was used, that night, only\r\nby Klem Zareff's guards. Everybody else was inside, eating cold\r\nrations when hungry and, when they could keep awake no longer, bedding\r\ndown on piles of blankets or going up to the barracks rooms above.\r\n\r\nThe next day they found the relay station which rebroadcast signals\r\nfrom the buried aerial--or wouldn't one say, sub-terrial--on top of\r\nthe mesa. As Conn had expected, it was on top of a high butte three\r\nand a half miles to the south; it had been so skillfully camouflaged\r\nthat none of the outlaw bands who roamed the Badlands had found it.\r\nAfter that, Force Command Duplicate was in communication with the rest\r\nof Poictesme.\r\n\r\nThey moved into the staff headquarters at the top; Foxx Travis's\r\noffice, tidied up, became the headquarters for the company officials\r\nand chief supervisors. The workmen quartered themselves in the\r\nenlisted barracks, helping themselves liberally to anything they\r\nfound. The crowds of sightseers kept swarming in, giving Tom\r\nBrangwyn's police plenty to do. Tom himself turned the marshal's\r\noffice in Litchfield over to his chief deputy. Klem Zareff insisted on\r\nmore men for his guard force. A dozen gunboats, eighty-foot craft\r\nmounting one 90-mm gun, several smaller auto-cannon and one\r\nmissile-launcher, had been found; he took them over immediately,\r\nnaming them for capital ships of the old System States Navy. It took\r\nsome argument to dissuade him from repainting all of them black and\r\ngreen. He kept them all in the air, with a swarm of smaller airboats\r\nand combat-cars, circling the underground headquarters at a radius of\r\na hundred miles. These patrols reported a general exodus from the\r\nregion. At least a dozen outlaw bands, all with fast contragravity,\r\nhad been camped inside the zone. Some fled at once; the rest needed\r\nonly a few warning shots to send them away. Other bands, looking like\r\nlegitimate prospecting parties, began to filter into the Badlands.\r\nZareff came to Rodney Maxwell--instead of Kurt Fawzi, the titular head\r\nof the company, which was significant--to find out what policy\r\nregarding them would be.\r\n\r\n\"Well, we have no right to keep them out, as long as they stay outside\r\nour ten-mile radius,\" Conn's father said. \"And as we're the only\r\nthing that even looks like law around here, I'd say we have an\r\nobligation to give them protection. Have your boats investigate them;\r\nif they're legitimate, tell them they can call on us for help if they\r\nneed it.\"\r\n\r\nConn protested, privately.\r\n\r\n\"There's a lot of stuff around here, in small caches,\" he said.\r\n\"Equipment for guerrilla companies, in event of invasion. When work\r\nslacks off here, we could pick that stuff up.\"\r\n\r\n\"Conn, there's an old stock-market maxim: 'A bear can make money\r\nsometimes, and a bull can make money sometimes, but in the long run, a\r\nhog always loses.' Let the other people find some of this; it'll all\r\nhelp the Plan. Fact is, I've been thinking of leaking some\r\ninformation, if I can do it without Fawzi and that gang finding out.\r\nDo you know a good supply depot or something like that, say over on\r\nAcaire, or on the west coast? Big enough to be important, and to start\r\na second prospectors' rush away from us.\"\r\n\r\n\"How about one of those hospitals?\"\r\n\r\n\"No; not a hospital. We might use them to talk Wade Lucas into joining\r\nus. A lot of medical stores would be a good bait for him. I'm afraid\r\nhe's going to make trouble if we don't do something about him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, how about engineering and construction equipment? I know where\r\nthere's a lot of that, down to the southwest.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's farming country; that stuff'll be useful down there. I'll do\r\nthat.\"\r\n\r\nThe next morning, Rodney Maxwell scorched the stratosphere to\r\nStorisende in his recon-car. The day after he got back, there was a\r\nbig discovery of engineering equipment to the southwest and, as he had\r\nanticipated, a second rush of prospectors. They had the vertical shaft\r\nclear now, and the _Lester Dawes_ was shuttling back and forth between\r\nForce Command Duplicate and Storisende. Other ships were coming in,\r\nnow, mostly privately owned freighting ships. They bought almost\r\nanything, as fast as it came out.\r\n\r\nThe stock market had been paralyzed for a couple of days after the\r\ndiscovery of Force Command; nobody seemed to know what to sell and\r\nwhat to hold. Now it was going perfectly insane. Twenty or thirty new\r\ncompanies were being formed; unlike Litchfield Exploration & Salvage,\r\nthey were all offering their stock to the public. A week after the\r\nopening of Force Command, the Stock Exchange reported the first\r\nhalf-million-share day since the War. A week after that, there were\r\ntwo million-share days in succession.\r\n\r\nSome of the L. E. & S. stockholders who had come out on the first day\r\nbegan drifting back to Litchfield. Lester Dawes was the first to\r\ndefect; there was nothing he could do at Force Command, and a great\r\ndeal that needed his personal attention at the bank. Morgan Gatworth\r\nand Lorenzo Menardes and one or two others followed. Kurt Fawzi,\r\nhowever, refused to leave. Merlin was somewhere here at Force Command,\r\nhe was sure of it, and he wasn't leaving till it was found. Neither\r\nwere Franz Veltrin or Dolf Kellton or Judge Ledue. Tom Brangwyn\r\nresigned as town marshal; Klem Zareff was too busy even to think of\r\nMerlin; he had almost as many men under his command, and twice as much\r\ncontragravity, as he had had when the System States Alliance Army had\r\nsurrendered.\r\n\r\nConn flew to Litchfield, and found that the public works project had\r\ncome to a stop at noon of the day when Force Command was entered, and\r\nthat nothing had been done on it since. The cold vitrifier was still\r\nstanding in the middle of the Mall, and topside Litchfield was\r\nlittered in a dozen places with forsaken equipment and half-completed\r\npaving. There was no one in Kurt Fawzi's office in the Airlines\r\nBuilding, and the employment office was jammed with migratory workers\r\nvainly seeking jobs.\r\n\r\nHe hunted up Morgan Gatworth, the lawyer.\r\n\r\n\"Can't some of you get things started again?\" he wanted to know. \"This\r\nplace is worse than it was before they started cleaning up.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I know.\" Gatworth walked to an open window and looked down on\r\nthe littered Mall. \"But everybody just dropped everything as soon as\r\nyou opened Force Command. Kurt Fawzi's not been back here since.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, you're here. Lester Dawes and Lorenzo Menardes are here. Why\r\ndon't you just take over. Kurt Fawzi couldn't care less what you do;\r\nhe's forgotten he is mayor of Litchfield. He's forgotten there is a\r\nLitchfield.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I don't like to just move into the mayor's office and take\r\nover....\"\r\n\r\nFrom somewhere below, a submachine gun hammered. There were yells,\r\npistol shots, and the submachine gun hammered again, a couple of short\r\nbursts.\r\n\r\n\"Some of the farm-tramps who can't get jobs, trying to steal something\r\nto eat, I suppose,\" Conn commented. Gatworth was frowning\r\nthoughtfully. He'd only need one more, very slight, push. \"Why don't\r\nyou talk to Wade Lucas. He's got brains, and he's honest--nobody but\r\nan honest man would have made himself as unpopular as Lucas has. If\r\nyou pretend to be disillusioned with this Merlin business it might\r\nhelp convince him.\"\r\n\r\n\"He was blaming you and your father for what's been going on here in\r\nthe last two weeks. Yes. He'd help get things straightened out.\"\r\n\r\nAt home, he found his mother simply dazed. She was happy to see him,\r\nand solicitous about his and his father's health. It seemed at times,\r\nthough, as if he were somebody she had never met before. Events had\r\ngotten so far beyond her that she wasn't even trying to catch up.\r\n\r\nFlora, returning from school, stopped short when she saw him.\r\n\r\n\"Well! I hope you like what you've done!\" she greeted him.\r\n\r\n\"For a start, yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"For a start! You know what you've done?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. I don't know what you think I've done, though. Tell me.\"\r\n\r\n\"You've turned everything into a madhouse; you've sent this whole\r\nworld Merlin-crazy. Look at the stock market....\"\r\n\r\n\"You look at it. All I can see is a pack of lunatics playing Russian\r\nroulette with five chambers loaded out of six. Some of this so-called\r\nstock that's being peddled around isn't worth five millisols a\r\nshare--Seekers for Merlin, Ltd., closed today at a hundred and\r\nseventy. You notice, there isn't any L. E. & S. being traded. If you\r\ndon't believe me, talk to Lester Dawes; he'll tell you what we think\r\nof this market.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, it's your fault!\"\r\n\r\n\"In part it's my fault that any of these quarter-wits have any money\r\nto play the market with. They wouldn't have money enough to play a\r\nfive-centisol slot machine if we hadn't gotten a little business\r\nstarted.\"\r\n\r\nThere was just a little truth to that, too. A few woolen socks were\r\ncoming out from under mattresses, and a few tin cans were being\r\nexhumed in cellars, since the new flood of Federation equipment and\r\nsupplies had gotten on the market. He'd seen a freshly lettered sign\r\non Len Yeniguchi's tailor shop: QUARTER PRICE IN FEDERATION\r\nCURRENCY.\r\n\r\nThat night, however, he had one of the nightmares he used to have as a\r\nchild--a dream of climbing up onto a huge machine and getting it\r\nstarted, and then clinging, helpless and terrified, unable to stop it\r\nas it went faster and faster toward destruction.\r\n\r\nKlem Zareff's patrols were encountering larger outlaw bands, the\r\nresult of gang mergers. They were fighting with prospecting parties,\r\nand prospecting parties were fighting one another. Much of this was\r\nmaking the newscasts. One battle, between two regularly chartered\r\nprospecting companies, lasted three days, with an impressive casualty\r\nlist.\r\n\r\nPublic demands were growing that the Planetary Government do something\r\nabout the situation; the Government was wondering what to do, or how.\r\nThere were indignant questions in Parliament. Finally, the Government\r\ndragged a couple of armed ships off Mothball Row--a combat freighter\r\nlike the _Lester Dawes_, and a big assault transport--and began trying\r\nto get them into commission.\r\n\r\nAnd, of course, the market boom was still on. The newscasts were full\r\nof that, too. He had started worrying about _if_ a bust came; now he\r\nwas worrying about what would happen _when_ it did. Another good\r\nreason for wanting to get to Koshchei and getting a hypership built;\r\nwhen the bust came, he and his father would want one, very badly.\r\n\r\nIn any case, it was time to begin getting an expedition ready for\r\nBarathrum Spaceport. Quite a few of the new companies had large\r\ncontragravity craft, and the nascent Planetary Air Navy was\r\napproaching a state of being. He wanted to get out there before\r\nanybody else did.\r\n\r\nMaybe if they got the hypership built soon enough, it would start a\r\nsecond, sound boom that would cushion the crash of the present\r\nspeculative market when it came, as come it must.\r\n\r\nHe talked to Klem Zareff about borrowing a couple of the eighty-foot\r\ngunboats. Zareff's attitude was automatically negative.\r\n\r\n\"We mustn't weaken our defense-perimeter; we'd be inviting disaster.\r\nWhy, this whole country in here is simply swarming with outlaws. They\r\nfired on one of our gunboats, the _Werewolf_, yesterday.\"\r\n\r\nHe'd heard about that; somebody had launched a missile from the\r\nground, and the _Werewolf_ had detonated it with a counter-missile. It\r\nhad probably been some legitimate prospecting company who'd taken the\r\nL. E. & S. craft for a pirate.\r\n\r\n\"And there was a battle down in the Devil's Pigpen day before\r\nyesterday.\"\r\n\r\nThat had been outlaws; they had been annihilated by something calling\r\nitself Seekers for Merlin, Ltd., whose stock was still skyrocketing on\r\nthe Exchange. He mentioned that.\r\n\r\n\"These other prospecting companies are doing a lot of our\r\noutlaw-fighting for us, and as long as the country's full of small\r\nindependent parties, the outlaws go after them and leave us alone.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, and I have my doubts about a lot of these prospecting companies,\r\nand a lot of the outlaws, too,\" Zareff said. \"I think a lot of both\r\nare Federation agents; they're waiting till we find Merlin, and then\r\nthey'll all jump us.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" Conn adjusted his argument to the old Rebel's obsession, \"I'll\r\nadmit that, as a possibility. If so, we'll need heavier weapons than\r\nwe have. This spaceport on Barathrum might be just the place to get\r\nthem.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. It might. Defense armament, and stored ships' weapons. Say, if\r\nwe grab that place and move all the heavy guns and missiles here, we\r\ncould stand off anybody.\" The thought of a fight with minions of the\r\nTerran Federation seemed to have shaved ten years off his age in a\r\ntwinkling. \"You take the _Lester Dawes_, and, let's say, three of\r\nthese gunboats. Let me see. _Goblin_, Fred Karski. And _Vampire_,\r\nCharley Gatworth. And _Dragon_, Stefan Jorisson. They're all good men.\r\nHome Guard; trained them myself.\"\r\n\r\n\"Aren't you coming, Colonel?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I'd like to, Conn, but I can't. I don't want to be away from\r\nhere; no telling what might happen. But you keep in constant\r\nscreen-contact; if you get into any trouble, I'll come with everything\r\nI can put into the air.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIX\r\n\r\n\r\nBarathrum was a grim land, naked black and gray. Spines and crags of\r\nbare rock jutted up, lava-flows like black glaciers twisting among\r\nthem. It was split by faults and fissures, pimpled with ash-cones.\r\nExcept for the seabirds that nested among the cliffs and the few thin\r\npatches of green where seeds windblown from the mainland had taken\r\nroot, it was as lifeless as when some ancient convulsion had thrust it\r\nup from the sea, Barathrum was a dead Inferno, untenanted even by the\r\ndamned; by comparison, the Badlands seemed lushly fertile.\r\n\r\nThe four craft crossed above the line of white breakers that marked\r\nthe division of sea and land; the gunboat _Goblin_ in the lead, her\r\nsisters, _Vampire_ and _Dragon_ to right and left and a little behind,\r\nand the _Lester Dawes_ a few miles in the rear. Fred Karski was at the\r\n_Goblin's_ controls; Conn, beside him, was peering ahead into the\r\nteleview screen and shifting his eyes from it to the map and back\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nSomebody behind him was saying that it would be a nice place to be\r\nair-wrecked. Somebody else was telling him not to joke about it. From\r\nthe radio, his father was asking: \"Can you see it, yet?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not yet. We're on the right map-and-compass direction; we should\r\nbefore long.\"\r\n\r\n\"We're picking up radiation,\" Fred Karski said. \"Way above normal\r\ncount. I hope the place isn't hot.\"\r\n\r\n\"We're getting that, too,\" Rodney Maxwell said. \"Looks like power\r\nradiation; something must be on there.\"\r\n\r\nAfter forty years, that didn't seem likely. He leaned over to look at\r\nthe omnigeiger, then whistled. If that was normal leakage from\r\ninactive power units, there must be enough of them to power ten towns\r\nthe size of Litchfield.\r\n\r\n\"Something's operating there,\" he said, and then realized what that\r\nmeant. Somebody had beaten them to the spaceport. That would be one of\r\nthe new companies formed after the opening of Force Command. He was\r\nwishing, now, that he hadn't let himself be talked out of coming here\r\nfirst. Older and wiser heads indeed!\r\n\r\nFred Karski whistled shrilly into his radio phone. \"Attention\r\neverybody! General alert. Prepare for combat; prepare to take\r\nimmediate evasive action. We must assume that the spaceport is\r\noccupied, and that the occupants are hostile. Captain Poole, will you\r\nplease make ready aboard your ship? Reduce both speed and altitude,\r\nand ready your guns and missiles at once.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, now, wait a minute, young fellow,\" Poole began to argue. \"You\r\ndon't know--\"\r\n\r\n\"No. I don't. And I want all of us alive after we find out, too,\"\r\nKarski replied.\r\n\r\nRodney Maxwell's voice, in the background, said something\r\nindistinguishable. Poole said ungraciously, \"Well, all right, if you\r\nthink so....\"\r\n\r\nThe _Lester Dawes_ began dropping to the rear and going down toward\r\nthe ground. Conn returned to the teleview screen in time to see the\r\ntruncated cone of the extinct volcano rise on the horizon, dwarfing\r\neverything around it. Fred Karski was talking to Colonel Zareff, back\r\nat Force Command, giving him the radiation count.\r\n\r\n\"That's occupied,\" the old soldier replied. \"Mass-energy converter\r\ngoing. Now, Fred, don't start any shooting unless you have to, but\r\ndon't get yourself blown to MC waiting on them to fire the first\r\nshot.\"\r\n\r\nThe dark cone bulked higher and higher in the screen. It must be seven\r\nmiles around the crater, and a mile deep; when that thing blew out,\r\nten or fifteen thousand years ago, it must have been something to see,\r\npreferably from a ship a thousand miles off-planet. It was so huge\r\nthat it was hard to realize that the jumbled foothills around it were\r\nthemselves respectably lofty mountains.\r\n\r\nWhen they were within five miles of it, something twinkled slightly\r\nnear the summit. An instant later, the missileman, in his turret\r\noverhead, shouted:\r\n\r\n\"Missile coming up; counter-missile off!\"\r\n\r\n\"Grab onto something, everybody!\" Karski yelled, bracing himself in\r\nhis seat.\r\n\r\nConn, on his feet, flung his arms around an upright stanchion and hung\r\non. Fred's hand gave a twisting jerk on the steering handle; the\r\n_Goblin_ went corkscrewing upward. In the rearview screen, Conn saw a\r\npink fireball blossom far below. The sound and the shock-wave never\r\nreached them; the _Goblin_ outran them. _Dragon_ and _Vampire_ were\r\nspiraling away in opposite directions. The radio was loud with voices,\r\nand a few of the words were almost printable. A gong began clanging\r\nfrom the command post on top of the mesa on the mainland.\r\n\r\n\"Be quiet, all of you!\" Klem Zareff was bellowing. \"And get back from\r\nthere. Back three or four miles; close enough so they won't dare use\r\nthermonuclears. Take cover behind one of those ridges, where they\r\ncan't detect you. Then we can start figuring what the Gehenna to do\r\nnext.\"\r\n\r\nThat made sense. And get it settled who's in command of this\r\nDonnybrook, while we're at it, Conn thought. He looked into the rear\r\nand sideview screens, and taking cover immediately made even more\r\nsense. Two more fireballs blossomed, one dangerously close to the\r\n_Dragon_. Guns were firing from the mountaintop, too, big ones,\r\nand shells were bursting close to them. He saw a shell land on and\r\nanother beside one of the enemy gun positions--115-mm's from the\r\n_Lester Dawes_, he supposed. He continued to cling to the\r\nstanchion, and the _Goblin_ shot straight up, and he was expecting\r\nto see the sky blacken and the stars come out when the gunboat leveled\r\nand started circling down again. The mountainside, he saw, was sending\r\nup a lightning-crackling tower of smoke and dust that swelled into a\r\nmushroom top.\r\n\r\nKlem Zareff, on the radio, was demanding to know who'd launched that.\r\n\r\n\"We did, sir; _Dragon_,\" Stefan Jorisson was replying. \"We had to get\r\nrid of it. We took a hit. Gun turret's smashed, Milt Hennant's dead,\r\nand Abe Samuels probably will be before I'm done talking, and if we\r\nget this crate down in one piece, it'll do for a miracle till a real\r\none happens.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, be careful how you shoot those things off,\" his father\r\nimplored, from the _Lester Dawes_. \"Get one inside the crater and we\r\nwon't have any spaceport.\"\r\n\r\nThe _Lester Dawes_ vanished behind a mountain range a few miles from\r\nthe volcano. The _Dragon_, still airborne but in obvious difficulties,\r\nwas limping after her, and the _Vampire_ was covering the withdrawal,\r\nfiring rapidly but with doubtful effect with her single 90-mm and\r\ntossing out counter-missiles. There was another fireball between her\r\nand the mountain. Then, when the _Dragon_ had followed the _Lester\r\nDawes_ to safety, she turned tail and bolted, the _Goblin_ following.\r\nAs they approached the mountains, something the shape of a recon-car\r\nand about half the size passed them going in the opposite direction.\r\nAs they dropped into the chasm on the other side, another nuclear went\r\noff at the volcano.\r\n\r\nWhen Conn and Fred left the _Goblin_ and boarded the ship, they found\r\nRodney Maxwell, Captain Poole, and a couple of others on the bridge.\r\nCharley Gatworth, the skipper of the _Vampire_, Morgan Gatworth's son,\r\nwas with them, and, imaged in a screen, so was Klem Zareff. One of the\r\nother screens, from a pickup on the _Vampire_, showed the _Dragon_\r\nlying on her side, her turret crushed and her gun, with the\r\nmuzzle-brake gone, bent upward. A couple of lorries from the _Lester\r\nDawes_ were alongside; as Conn watched, a blanket-wrapped body, and\r\nthen another, were lowered from the disabled gunboat.\r\n\r\n\"Fred, how are you and Charley fixed for counter-missiles?\" Zareff was\r\nasking. \"Get loaded up with them off the ship, as many as you can\r\ncarry. Charley, you go up on top of this ridge above, and take cover\r\nwhere you can watch the mountain. Transmit what you see back to the\r\nship. Fred, you take a position about a quarter way around from where\r\nyou are now. Don't let them send anything over, but don't start\r\nanything yourselves. I'm coming out with everything I can gather up\r\nhere; I'll be along myself in a couple of hours, and the rest will be\r\nstringing in after me. In the meantime, Rodney, you're in command.\"\r\n\r\nWell, that settled that. There was one other point, though.\r\n\r\n\"Colonel,\" Conn said, \"I assume that this spaceport is occupied by one\r\nof these new prospecting companies. We have no right to take it away\r\nfrom them, have we?\"\r\n\r\n\"They fired on us without warning,\" Karski said. \"They killed Milt,\r\nand it's ten to one Abe won't live either. We owe them something for\r\nthat.\"\r\n\r\n\"We do, and we'll pay off. Conn, you assume wrong. This gang's been at\r\nthe spaceport long enough to get the detection system working and put\r\nthe defense batteries on ready. They didn't do that since this\r\nmorning, and up to last evening they neglected to file claim. I'll\r\nassume they're on the wrong side of the law. They're outlaws, Conn.\r\nAll the raids along the east coast; everybody's blamed them on the\r\nBadlands gangs. I'll admit they're responsible for some of it, but\r\nI'll bet this gang at the spaceport is doing most of it.\"\r\n\r\nThat was reasonable. Barathrum was closer to the scene of the worst\r\noutlaw depredations than the Badlands, not more than an hour at Mach\r\nTwo. And nobody ever thought of Barathrum as an outlaw hangout. People\r\nrarely thought of Barathrum at all. He liked the idea. The only thing\r\nagainst it was that he wanted so badly to believe it.\r\n\r\nThey brought the body of Milt Hennant aboard, and Abe Samuels, swathed\r\nin bandages and immobilized by narcotic injections. A few more of the\r\n_Dragon_'s six-man crew had been injured. Jorrisson, the skipper, had\r\none trouser leg slit to the belt and his right thigh splinted and\r\nbandaged; he took over the _Lester Dawes_' missile controls, which he\r\ncould manage sitting in one place. Fred Karski and Charley Gatworth\r\nwent aboard their craft and lifted out.\r\n\r\nFor a long time, nothing happened. Conn got out the plans of the\r\nvolcano spaceport and the photomaps of the surrounding area. The\r\nprincipal entrance, the front door of the spaceport, was the crater of\r\nthe extinct volcano itself. It was ringed, outside, with\r\nlaunching-sites and gun positions, and according to the data he had,\r\nsome of the guns were as big as 250-mm. How many outlaws there were to\r\nman them was a question a lot of people could get killed trying to\r\nanswer. The ship docks and shops were down on the level of the crater\r\nfloor, in caverns, both natural and excavated, that extended far back\r\ninto the mountain. There were two galleries, one above the other,\r\nextending entirely around the inside of the crater near the top;\r\npassages from them gave access to the outside gun and missile\r\npositions.\r\n\r\nWith a dozen ships the size of the _Lester Dawes_, about five thousand\r\nmen, and a CO who wasn't concerned with trivialities like casualties,\r\nthey could have taken the place in half an hour. With what they had,\r\ntrying to fight their way in at the top was out of the question.\r\n\r\nThere was another way in. He had known about it from the beginning,\r\nand he was trying desperately to think of a way not to utilize it. It\r\nwas a tunnel two miles long, running into some of the bottom workshops\r\nand storerooms back of the ship berths from a big blowhole or small\r\ncrater at the foot of the mountain. According to the fifty-year-old\r\nplans, it was big enough to take a gunboat in, and on paper it looked\r\nlike a royal highway straight to the heart of the enemy's stronghold.\r\n\r\nTo Conn, it looked like a wonderful place to commit suicide. He'd only\r\nhad a short introductory course, in one semester, in military and\r\nprotective robotics, just enough to give him a foundation if he wanted\r\nto go into that branch of the subject later. It was also enough to\r\ngive him an idea of the sort of booby-traps that tunnel could be\r\nfilled with. He knew what he'd have put into it if he'd been defending\r\nthat place.\r\n\r\nColonel Zareff had sent one last message from Force Command when he\r\nlifted off with a flight of recon-cars. After that, he maintained a\r\ncommunication blackout. It was an hour and a half before he got close\r\nenough to be detected from the outlaw stronghold. Immediately, the\r\nvolcano began spewing out missiles. Poole hastily took the _Lester\r\nDawes_ ten miles down the rift-valley in sixty seconds, while Stefan\r\nJorisson put out a nuclear-warhead missile and left it circling about\r\nwhere the ship had been. From their respective positions, Fred Karski\r\nand Charley Gatworth filled the airspace midway to the volcano with\r\ncounter-missiles, each loaded with four rockets. There were\r\nexplosions, fireballs in the air and rising cumulus clouds of\r\nvaricolored smoke and dust. Only about half the enemy missiles reached\r\nthe _Lester Dawes'_ former position.\r\n\r\nWhen their controllers, back at the volcano, couldn't see the ship in\r\ntheir screens, the missiles bunched together. Immediately, Jorisson\r\nsent his missile up to join them and detonated it. Including his own,\r\neight nuclear weapons went off together in a single blast that shook\r\nthe ground like an earthquake and churned the air like a hurricane.\r\nKlem Zareff came on-screen at once.\r\n\r\n\"Now what did you do?\" he demanded. \"Blew the whole place up, didn't\r\nyou?\"\r\n\r\nRodney Maxwell told him. Zareff laughed. \"They might just think they\r\ngot the ship; all the pickups would be smashed before they could see\r\nwhat really happened. You're about ten miles south of that? Be with\r\nyou in a few minutes.\"\r\n\r\nThey got a screen on for his rearview pickup. Zareff had with him a\r\ndozen recon-cars, some of them under robo-control; six gunboats\r\nfollowed, and behind them, to the horizon, other craft were strung\r\nout--airboats, troop carriers, and freight-scows. They could see enemy\r\nmissiles approaching in Zareff's front screen; counter-missiles got\r\nmost of them, and a couple of pilotless recon-cars were sacrificed.\r\nThe _Lester Dawes_ blasted more missiles as they crossed the top of\r\nthe mountain range. Then Zareff's car was circling in and entering at\r\none of the ship's open cargo-ports. Zareff and Anse Dawes got out.\r\n\r\n\"Gunboats are only half an hour behind,\" Zareff said. \"Get some\r\nscreens on to them, Anse; you know the combinations. Now let's see\r\nwhat kind of a mess we're in here.\"\r\n\r\nIt was almost a miracle, the way the tottering old man Conn had seen\r\non the dock at Litchfield when he had arrived from Terra had been\r\nrejuvenated.\r\n\r\nThe rest of the reinforcements arrived slowly, sending missiles and\r\ncounter-missiles out ahead of them. Zareff began worrying about the\r\nsupply; the enemy didn't seem to be running short. By 1300--Conn noted\r\nthe time incredulously; the battle seemed to have been going on\r\nforever, instead of just four hours--the _Lester Dawes_ had moved\r\nhalfway around the volcano and was almost due west of it, and the\r\neight gunboats were spaced all around the perimeter. Then one stopped\r\ntransmitting; in the other screens, there was a rising fireball where\r\nshe had been. The radio was loud with verbal reports.\r\n\r\n\"_Poltergeist_,\" Zareff said, naming half a dozen names. One or two of\r\nthem had been schoolmates of Conn's at the Academy; he knew how he'd\r\nfeel about it later, but now it simply didn't register.\r\n\r\n\"They're launching missiles faster than we can shoot them down,\" he\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\n\"That's usually the beginning of the end,\" Zareff said. \"I saw it\r\nhappen too often during the War. We've got to get inside that place.\r\nIt's a lot of harmless fun to send contragravity robots out to smash\r\neach other, but it doesn't win battles. Battles are won by men,\r\nstanding with their feet on the ground, using personal weapons.\"\r\n\r\n\"We'll have to win this one pretty soon,\" Rodney Maxwell said. \"The\r\namount of nuclear energy we've been releasing will be detectable\r\nanywhere on the planet by now. The Government has a ship like the\r\n_Lester Dawes_ in commission; if this keeps on, she'll be coming out\r\nfor a look.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then we'll have help,\" Captain Poole said.\r\n\r\n\"We need Government help like we need the polka-dot fever,\" Rodney\r\nMaxwell said. \"If they get in it, they'll claim the spaceport\r\nthemselves, and we'll have fought a battle for nothing.\"\r\n\r\nWell, that was it, then. The spaceport was essential to the Maxwell\r\nPlan. He'd gotten seven men killed--eight, if the recon-car that was\r\ntaking Abe Samuels to the hospital in Litchfield didn't make it in\r\ntime--and it was up to him to see that they hadn't died for nothing.\r\nHe spread the photo-map and the spaceport plans on the chart table.\r\n\r\n\"Look at this,\" he said.\r\n\r\nKlem Zareff looked at it. He didn't like it any better than Conn had.\r\nHe studied the plan for a moment, chewing his cigar.\r\n\r\n\"You know, it's possible they don't know that thing exists,\" he said,\r\nwithout too much conviction. \"You'll be betting the lives of at least\r\ntwenty men; fewer than that couldn't accomplish anything.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll be putting mine on the table along with them,\" Conn said. \"I'll\r\nlead them in.\"\r\n\r\nHe was wishing he hadn't had to say that. He did, though. It was the\r\nonly thing he could say.\r\n\r\n\"You better pick the men to go with me, Colonel,\" he continued. \"You\r\nknow them better than I do. We'll need working equipment, too; I have\r\nno idea what we may have to take out of the way, inside.\"\r\n\r\n\"I won't call for volunteers,\" Zareff said. \"I'll pick Home Guards;\r\nthey did their volunteering when they joined.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let me pick one man, Colonel,\" Anse Dawes said. \"I'll pick me.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nX\r\n\r\n\r\nThey sent a snooper in first; it picked up faint radiation leakage\r\nfrom inactive power units of overhead lights, and nothing else. The\r\ntunnel stretched ahead of it, empty, and dark beyond its infrared\r\nvision. After it had gone a mile without triggering anything, the jeep\r\nfollowed, Anse Dawes piloting and Conn at the snooper controls\r\nwatching what it transmitted back. The two lorries followed, loaded\r\nwith men and equipment, and another jeep brought up the rear. They had\r\ncut screen-and-radio communication with the outside; they weren't even\r\nusing inter-vehicle communication.\r\n\r\nAt length, the snooper emerged into a big cavern, swinging slowly to\r\nscan it. The walls and ceiling were rough and irregular; it was\r\nnatural instead of excavated. Only the floor had been leveled smooth.\r\nThere were a lot of things in it, machinery and vehicles, all battered\r\nand in poor condition, dusty and cobwebbed: the spaceport junkheap. A\r\npassage, still large enough for one of the gunboats, led deeper into\r\nthe mountain toward the crater. They sent the snooper in and, after a\r\nwhile, followed.\r\n\r\nThey came to other rectangular, excavated caverns. On the plans, they\r\nwere marked as storerooms. Cases and crates, indeterminate shrouded\r\nobjects; some had never been disturbed, but here and there they found\r\nevidence of recent investigation.\r\n\r\nBeyond was another passage, almost as wide as the Mall in Litchfield;\r\neven the _Lester Dawes_ could have negotiated it. According to the\r\nplans, it ran straight out to the ship docks and the open crater\r\nbeyond. Anse turned the jeep into a side passage, and Conn recalled\r\nthe snooper and sent it ahead. On the plan, it led to another natural\r\ncavern, half its width shown as level with the entrance. The other\r\nhalf was a pit, marked as sixty feet deep; above this and just under\r\nthe ceiling, several passages branched out in different directions.\r\n\r\nThe snooper reported visible light ahead; fluoroelectric light from\r\none of the upper passages, and firelight from the pit. The\r\nair-analyzer reported woodsmoke and a faint odor of burning oil. He\r\nsent the snooper ahead, tilting it to look down into the pit.\r\n\r\nA small fire was burning in the center; around it, in a circle, some\r\nhundred and fifty people, including a few women and children, sat,\r\nsquatted or reclined. A low hum of voices came out of the soundbox.\r\n\r\n\"Who the blazes are they?\" Anse whispered. \"I can't see any way they\r\ncould have gotten down there.\"\r\n\r\nThey were in rags, and they weren't armed; there wasn't so much as a\r\nknife or a pistol among them. Conn motioned the lorries and the other\r\njeep forward.\r\n\r\n\"Prisoners,\" he said. \"I think they were hauled down here on a scow,\r\nshoved off, and left when the fighting started. Cover me,\" he told the\r\nmen in the lorries. \"I'm going down and talk to them.\"\r\n\r\nSomebody below must have heard something. As Anse took the jeep over\r\nand started floating it down, the circle around the fire began moving,\r\nthe women and children being pushed to the rear and the men gathering\r\nup clubs and other chance weapons. By the time the jeep grounded, the\r\nmen in the pit were standing defensively in front of the women and\r\nchildren.\r\n\r\nThey were all dirty and ragged; the men were unshaven. There was a\r\ntall man with a grizzled beard, in greasy coveralls; another man with\r\na black beard and an old Space Navy uniform, his head bandaged with a\r\ndirty and blood-caked rag; another in the same uniform, wearing a cap\r\non which the Terran Federation insignia had been replaced by the\r\nemblem of Transcontinent & Overseas Shiplines and the words CHIEF.\r\nAnd beside the tall man with the gray beard, was a girl\r\nin baggy trousers and a torn smock. Like the others, she was dirty,\r\nbut in spite of the rags and filth, Conn saw that she was beautiful.\r\nBlack hair, dark eyes, an impudently tilted nose.\r\n\r\nThey all looked at him in hostility that gradually changed to\r\nperplexity and then hope.\r\n\r\n\"Who are you?\" the tall man with the gray beard asked. \"You're none of\r\nthis gang here.\"\r\n\r\n\"Litchfield Exploration & Salvage; I'm Conn Maxwell.\"\r\n\r\nThat meant nothing; none of them had been near a news-screen lately.\r\n\r\n\"What's going on topside?\" the man with the bandaged head and the four\r\nstripes on his sleeve asked. \"There was firing, artillery and\r\nnuclears, and they herded us down here. Have you cleaned the bloody\r\nmurderers out?\"\r\n\r\n\"We're working on it,\" Conn said. \"I take it they aren't friends of\r\nyours?\"\r\n\r\nFoolish Question of the Year; they all made that evident.\r\n\r\n\"They took my ship; they murdered my first officer and half my crew\r\nand passengers....\"\r\n\r\n\"They burned our home and killed our servants,\" the girl said. \"They\r\nkidnapped my father and me....\"\r\n\r\n\"They've been keeping us here as slaves.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's the Blackie Perales gang,\" the tall man with the gray beard\r\nsaid. \"They've been making us work for them, converting a blasted tub\r\nof a contragravity ship into a spacecraft. I beg your pardon, Captain\r\nNichols; she was a fine ship--for her intended purpose.\"\r\n\r\n\"You're Captain Nichols?\" Anse Dawes exclaimed. \"Of the _Harriet\r\nBarne_?\"\r\n\r\n\"That's right. The _Harriet Barne's_ here; they've been making us work\r\non her, to convert her to an interplanetary craft, of all idiotic\r\nthings.\"\r\n\r\n\"My name's Yves Jacquemont,\" the man with the gray beard said. \"I'm a\r\nretired hyperspace maintenance engineer; I had a little business at\r\nWaterville, buying, selling and rebuilding agricultural machinery.\r\nThis gang found out about me; they raided and burned our village and\r\ncarried me and my daughter, Sylvie, away. We've been working for them\r\nfor the last four months, tearing Captain Nichols' ship down and\r\narmoring her with collapsium.\"\r\n\r\n\"How many pirates are there here?\"\r\n\r\nThat started an argument. Nobody was quite sure; two hundred and fifty\r\nseemed to be the highest estimate, which Conn decided to play safe by\r\naccepting.\r\n\r\n\"You get us out of here,\" Yves Jacquemont was saying. \"All we want is\r\na chance at them.\"\r\n\r\n\"How about arms? You can't do much with clubs and fists.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't worry about that; we know where to get arms. The treasure\r\nhouse, where they store their loot. There's plenty of arms and\r\nammunition, and anything else you can think of. They've used us to\r\nhelp stow the stuff; we know where it is.\"\r\n\r\n\"Anse, you remember those scows we saw, in the big room before we came\r\nto the broad passage? Take four men in the jeep; have them lift two of\r\nthem and bring them here. Then, you get out to the end of the tunnel\r\nand call the _Lester Dawes_. Tell them what's happened, tell them they\r\ncan get gunboats all the way in, and wait to guide them when they\r\narrive.\"\r\n\r\nWhen Anse turned and climbed into the jeep, he asked Yves Jacquemont:\r\n\"Why does this Perales want an interplanetary ship?\"\r\n\r\n\"He's crazy!\" Jacquemont swore. \"Paranoid; megalomaniac. He talks of\r\norganizing all the pirates and outlaws on the planet into one band and\r\nmaking himself king. He's heard that there are Space Navy superweapons\r\non Koshchei--I suppose there are, at that--and he wants to get a lot\r\nof planetbusters and hellburners and annihilators.\" He lowered his\r\nvoice. \"Captain Nichols and I were going to fix up something that'd\r\nblow the _Harriet Barne_ up as soon as he got her out of atmosphere.\"\r\n\r\nHe talked for a while to Jacquemont and his daughter Sylvie, and to\r\nNichols and the chief engineer, whose name was Vibart. There was\r\nevidently nothing else at the spaceport of which a spaceship could be\r\nbuilt, but there were foundries and rolling-mills and a\r\ncollapsed-matter producer. The _Harriet Barne_ was gutted, half torn\r\ndown, and half armored with new collapsium-plated sheet steel. It\r\nmight be possible to continue the work on her and take her to space.\r\n\r\nThen the two scows floated over the top of the pit and began letting\r\ndown. They got the prisoners into them, the combat-effective men in\r\none and the women and children in the other. At the top, he took over\r\nthe remaining jeep, getting Jacquemont, his daughter, and the two\r\ncontragravityship officers in with him.\r\n\r\n\"Up to the top,\" Jacquemont said. \"Take the middle passage, and turn\r\nright at the next intersection.\"\r\n\r\nAs they approached the section where the pirates stored their loot,\r\nthe sound of guns and explosions grew louder, and they began picking\r\nup radio and screen signals, all of which were scrambled and\r\nincomprehensible. The pirates, in different positions, talking among\r\nthemselves. With all that, it ought to be safe to use their own\r\ncommunication equipment; nobody would notice it.\r\n\r\nThe treasure room looked like a giant pack rat's nest. Cases and\r\ncrates of merchandise, bales, boxes, barrels. Machinery. Household and\r\nindustrial robots. The prisoners piled out of the two scows and began\r\nrummaging. Somebody found a case of cigarettes and smashed it open; in\r\na moment, cartons were being tossed around and opened, and everybody\r\nwas smoking. The pirates evidently hadn't issued any tobacco rations\r\nto their prisoners.\r\n\r\nAnd they found arms and ammunition, began ripping open cases, handing\r\nout rifles, pistols, submachine guns. The prisoners grabbed them even\r\nmore hungrily than the cigarettes. Sylvie Jacquemont took charge of\r\nthe ammunition; she had three men opening boxes for her, while she\r\npassed out boxes of cartridges and made sure that everybody had\r\nammunition to fit their weapons. A ragged man who might have been a\r\nfarm-tramp or a rich planter before his capture had gotten a bale of\r\ncloth open and was tossing rags around while the chief engineer\r\ninspected weapons and showed people how to clean out the cosmoline and\r\nfill their spare magazines.\r\n\r\nConn collected a few of his own party.\r\n\r\n\"Let's look these robots over,\" he said. \"Find about half a dozen we\r\ncan load with blasting explosive and send ahead of us on\r\ncontragravity.\"\r\n\r\nThey found several--an electric-light servicer, a couple of\r\nwall-and-window washers, a serving-robot that looked as if it had come\r\nfrom a restaurant, and an all-purpose robo-janitor. In the passage\r\noutside, they began loading the lorries with bricks of ionite and\r\npackages of cataclysmite, packing all the scrap-iron and other junk\r\naround the explosives that they could. As soon as they had weapons,\r\nthe prisoners came swarming out, making more noise than was necessary\r\nand a good deal more than was safe. Sylvie Jacquemont, with a\r\nsubmachine gun slung from one shoulder and a canvas bag of spare\r\nmagazines from the other, came over to see what he was doing.\r\n\r\n\"Well, look what you're doing to him!\" she mock-reproached. \"That's a\r\ndirty trick to play on a little robot!\"\r\n\r\nHe grinned at her. \"You and my mother would get along. She always\r\ntreats robots like people.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, they are, sort of. They aren't alive--at least, I don't think\r\nthey are--but they do what you tell them, and they learn tricks, and\r\nthey have personalities.\"\r\n\r\nThat was true. He didn't think robots were alive, either, though\r\nbiophysics professors tended to become glibly evasive when pinned down\r\nto defining life. Robots could learn, if you used the term loosely\r\nenough. And any robot with more than five hundred hours service picked\r\nup a definite and often exasperating personality.\r\n\r\n\"I've been working with them, and tearing them down and fixing them,\r\never since I was in pigtails,\" she added.\r\n\r\nThe half-dozen natural leaders among the prisoners--Jacquemont and his\r\ndaughter, the two _Harriet Barne_ officers, and a couple of\r\nothers--bent over the photoprinted plans Conn had, located their\r\nposition, and told him as much as they could about what lay ahead.\r\nSylvie Jacquemont could handle robots; she would ride in the front\r\nseat of the jeep while he piloted. Vibart, the chief engineer, and\r\nYves Jacquemont would ride behind. Nichols would ride in the scow with\r\nthe fighting men. One lorry of his own party would follow the jeep;\r\nthe other would bring up the rear.\r\n\r\nHe snapped on the screen and punched the ship combination. Stefan\r\nJorisson appeared in it.\r\n\r\n\"Hi, Conn! You all right?\" He raised his voice. \"Conn's on-screen!\"\r\n\r\nHis father appeared at Jorisson's shoulder and, a moment later, Klem\r\nZareff.\r\n\r\n\"Well, we're in, all right,\" he said. \"We just picked up an army,\r\ntoo.\" He swung the jeep to get the crowd in the pickup, explaining who\r\nthey were. \"Did you hear from Anse?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, he just screened in,\" Rodney Maxwell said. \"He said a gunboat\r\ncan get in.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's right; clear into the crater.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, we're going to put three of them inside,\" Zareff told him.\r\n\"_Werewolf_, _Zombi_, and _Dero_. And a troop carrier with fifty men;\r\nflamethrowers, portable machine guns, bomb-launchers; regular\r\nspecial-weapons section. What can you do where you are?\"\r\n\r\n\"Here? Nothing. We're going to work around to the other side of the\r\ncrater, and then find a vertical shaft and go up topside and make as\r\nmuch disturbance as we can.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's it!\" Zareff approved. \"Pull them off balance; as soon as we\r\nget in, we'll go straight to the top. Look for us in about an hour;\r\nit's going to take time getting to the tunnel-mouth without being\r\nspotted from above.\"\r\n\r\nHe lifted the jeep and started off; the lorry, and the scows and the\r\nother lorry, followed; the snooper and the bomb-robots went ahead like\r\na pack of hunting dogs. They went through great chambers, dark and\r\nsilent and bulking with dusty machines. Jacquemont explained that the\r\nprisoners had never gotten into this section; the _Harriet Barne_ was\r\na mile or so to their right. Conn turned left, when the noise of\r\nfiring from outside became plainer. A foundry. A machine-shop which\r\nseemed to have been abandoned in the middle of some rush job that\r\nhadn't really been necessary. They came to a place even the snooper\r\ncouldn't enter, choked to the ceiling with dead vegetation, hydroponic\r\nseed-plants that had been left untended to grow wild and die. They\r\nemerged into outside light, in vast caves a mile high and open onto\r\nthe crater, and looked across the floor that had been leveled and\r\nvitrified to the other side, three and a half miles away.\r\n\r\nHe didn't know whether to be more awed by the original eruption that\r\nhad formed the crater or by the engineering feat of carving these\r\ndocks and ship-berths, big enough for the hugest hyperspaceship, into\r\nit.\r\n\r\nAt first, he had been afraid of getting into position too soon before\r\nthe task force from outside could profit by the diversion. Then he\r\nbegan to worry about the time it was taking to get halfway around the\r\ncrater. He could hear artillery thundering continuously above. Except\r\nat the very beginning of the battle, there had been little gunfire. He\r\nwondered if both sides were running out of lift-and-drive missiles, or\r\nif the fighting had gotten too close for anybody to risk using nuclear\r\nweapons.\r\n\r\nHe was also worrying about the women and children among the released\r\nprisoners.\r\n\r\n\"Why did the pirates bother with them?\" he asked Sylvie.\r\n\r\n\"They used the women and some of the old men to do housekeeping\r\nchores for them,\" she said. \"Mostly, though, they were hostages; if\r\nthe men didn't work, Perales threatened to punish the women and\r\nchildren. I wasn't doing any housework; I'm too good a mechanic. I was\r\nhelping on the ship.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, what'll I do with them when the fighting starts? I can't take\r\nthem into battle.\"\r\n\r\n\"You'll have to; it'll be the safest place for them. You can't leave\r\nthem anywhere and risk having them recaptured.\"\r\n\r\n\"That means we'll have to detach some men to cover them, and that'll\r\ncut our striking force down.\" He whistled at the sound-pickup of his\r\nscreen and told his father about it. \"What do I do with these people,\r\nanyhow?\"\r\n\r\n\"You're the officer in command, Conn,\" his father told him. \"Your\r\ndecision. How soon can you attack? We're almost through to the\r\ncrater.\"\r\n\r\n\"There's a vertical shaft right above us, and a lot of noise at the\r\ntop. We'll send up a couple of bomb-robots to clear things at the\r\nshaft-head and follow with everything we have.\"\r\n\r\n\"Noncombatants and all?\"\r\n\r\nHe nodded. \"Only thing we can do.\" An old quotation occurred to him.\r\n\"'If you want to make an omelet, you have to break eggs.'\"\r\n\r\nHe wondered who'd said that in the first place. One of the old\r\nPre-Atomic conquerors; maybe Hitler. No, Hitler would have said, \"If\r\nyou want to make sauerkraut, you have to chop cabbage.\" Maybe it was\r\nCaesar.\r\n\r\n\"We'd better send Gumshoe Gus up, first,\" Sylvie suggested.\r\n\r\n\"You handle him. Take a quick look around, and then pull him back.\r\nWe'll need him later.\" It was the first time he'd ever caught himself\r\ncalling a robot \"him,\" instead of \"it.\" He thought for a second, and\r\nadded: \"Give your father and Mr. Vibart the controls for the two\r\nwindow-washers; you handle the snooper.\"\r\n\r\nHe gave more instructions: Yves Jacquemont to turn his bomb-robot\r\nright, Vibart to turn his left; the two lorries to follow the jeep up\r\nthe shaft, the scows to follow. Then he leaned back and looked at the\r\nscreens that had been rigged under the top of the jeep. A circle of\r\nlight appeared in one, growing larger and brighter as the snooper\r\napproached the top of the shaft; two more came on as the bomb-robots\r\nfollowed.\r\n\r\n\"All right; follow me,\" he said into the inter-vehicle radio, and\r\nstarted the jeep slowly up the shaft.\r\n\r\nThe snooper popped out of the shaft, onto a gallery that had been cut\r\ninto the solid rock, fifty feet high and a hundred and fifty across,\r\nwith a low parapet on the outside and the mile-deep crater beyond.\r\nThere were a few grounded aircars and lorries in sight, and a medium\r\nairboat rested a hundred or so feet on the right of the shaft-opening.\r\nFifteen or twenty men were clustered around it, with a lifter loaded\r\nwith ammunition. They looked like any crowd of farm-tramps. Suddenly,\r\none of them saw the snooper, gave a yell, and fired at it with a\r\nrifle. Sylvie pulled it back into the shaft; her father and the chief\r\nengineer sent the two bomb-robots up onto the gallery. The right-hand\r\nrobot sped at the airboat; the last thing Conn saw in its screen was a\r\nface, bearded and villainous and contorted with fright, looking out\r\nthe pilot's window of the airboat. Then it went dead, and there was a\r\nroar from above. On the other side, several men were firing straight\r\nat the pickup of the other robot; it went dead, too, and there was a\r\nsecond explosion.\r\n\r\nIn the communication screen, somebody was yelling, \"Give them another\r\none for Milt Hennant!\" and his father was urging him to get in fast,\r\nbefore they recovered.\r\n\r\nIn peace or war, screen communication was a wonderful thing. The only\r\ntrouble was that it let in too many kibitzers.\r\n\r\nThe gallery, when the jeep emerged onto it, was empty except for\r\ncasualties, a few still alive. The side of the airboat was caved in;\r\nthe lifter-load of ammunition had gone up with the bomb. He moved the\r\njeep to the right of the shaft and waited for the vehicles behind him,\r\nsuffering a brief indecision.\r\n\r\n  _Never divide your force in the presence of the enemy._\r\n\r\nThere had been generals who had done that and gotten away with it, but\r\nthey'd had names like Foxx Travis and Robert E. Lee and\r\nNapoleon--Napoleon; that was who'd made that crack about omelets!\r\nThey'd known what they were doing. He was playing this battle by ear.\r\n\r\nThere was a lot of shouting ahead to the right. That meant live\r\npirates, a deplorable situation which ought to be corrected at once.\r\nThe communication screen was noisy, now; his father had gotten to the\r\ntop gallery with the three gun cutters, and was meeting resistance. He\r\nformed his column, his jeep and one of the lorries in front, the scows\r\nnext, and the second lorry behind, and started around the gallery\r\ncounterclockwise, the snoopers and the three remaining bomb-robots\r\nahead. They began running into resistance almost at once.\r\n\r\nBullets spatted on the armor glass in front of him, spalling it and\r\nblotching it with metal until he found that he could steer better by\r\nthe show-back of his view-pickup. He used that until the pickup was\r\nshot out. Then his father began wanting to know, from the\r\ncommunication screen, what was going on and where he was. A bomb or\r\nsomething went off directly under the jeep, bouncing it almost to the\r\nceiling; he found that it was impossible to lift it again after it\r\nsettled to the floor of the gallery, and they all piled out to fight\r\non foot. Sommers and his gang from the number one lorry were also\r\nafoot; their vehicle had been disabled. He saw them lifting wounded\r\ninto one of the scows.\r\n\r\nThey blew up the light-service robot to clear a nest of pirates who\r\nhad taken cover ahead of them. They sent the robo-janitor up a side\r\npassage and exploded it in a missile-launching position on the outside\r\nof the mountain; that produced a tremendous explosion. They began\r\nrunning out of cartridges, and had to stop and glean more from enemy\r\ncasualties. They expended their last bomb-robot, the restaurant\r\nserver, to break up another pirate resistance point.\r\n\r\nAt length he found himself, with Sylvie and her father and one of the\r\nHome Guardsmen from Sommers' lorry, lying behind an aircar somebody\r\nhad knocked out with a bazooka, with two dead pirates for company and\r\na dozen distressingly live ones ahead behind an improvised barricade.\r\nBehind, there was frantic firing; the rear-guard seemed to have run\r\ninto trouble, probably from some gang that had come down from the\r\nupper level. He wondered what his father was doing with the gunboats;\r\nsince abandoning the jeep, he had lost his only means of contact.\r\n\r\nSuddenly, the men in front jumped up from their barricade and came\r\nrunning toward him. Been reinforced, now they're counterattacking. His\r\nrifle was empty; he drew his pistol and shot one of them, and then he\r\nsaw that they were throwing up their hands and yelling for quarter.\r\nThis was something new.\r\n\r\nHe looked around quickly, to make sure none of the liberated prisoners\r\nexcept Jacquemont and his daughter were around, and then called to a\r\ncouple of his own men to come up and help him. While they were\r\nrelieving the pirates of their pistol belts and cartridge bandoliers,\r\nmore came up, their hands over their heads, herded by a combat car\r\nfrom which Tom Brangwyn covered them with a pair of 12-mm machine\r\nguns. Tom hadn't put in an appearance before he had taken his commando\r\nforce into the tunnel; he hadn't even known the chief of Company\r\nPolice was on Barathrum.\r\n\r\n\"Well, nice seeing you,\" he greeted. \"How did you get in?\"\r\n\r\n\"Over the top,\" Brangwyn told him. \"Everything's caved in on the other\r\nside. We have a quarter of the top gallery, and half of this one. Your\r\nfather's cleaning up above. Klem's got some men working along the\r\noutside.\"\r\n\r\nSylvie was tugging at his arm. \"Hey, look! Look at that!\" she was\r\nclamoring. \"Who's she belong to?\"\r\n\r\nHe looked; the _Lester Dawes_ was coming over the edge of the crater.\r\n\r\n\"She's ours,\" he said. \"It's all over but the mopping up. And counting\r\nthe egg breakage.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXI\r\n\r\n\r\nThe shooting died down to occasional rattles of small arms, usually\r\nfollowed by yells for quarter. An explosion thundered from across the\r\ncrater. The _Lester Dawes_ fired her big guns a few times. A machine\r\ngun stuttered. A pistol banged, far away. It took two hours before all\r\nthe pirates had been hunted out of hiding and captured, or killed if\r\nfound by their former captives, who were accepting no surrender\r\nwhatever.\r\n\r\nBlackie Perales had been one of the latter; he had been found, his\r\nclothes in rags and covered with dirt and grease, hiding under a\r\nmachine in one of the shops back of the dock in which the _Harriet\r\nBarne_ was being rebuilt. He had tried to claim that he was one of the\r\npirates' prisoners who had eluded the roundup at the beginning of the\r\nbattle and had been hiding there since. As soon as the real prisoners\r\nsaw and recognized him, they had fallen upon him and clubbed, kicked\r\nand stamped him out of any resemblance to humanity. At that, what he\r\ngot was probably only a fraction of what he deserved.\r\n\r\nThe egg breakage had been heavy, and not at all confined to the bad\r\neggs. A third gunboat, the _Banshee_, had been destroyed with all\r\nhands during the final attack from outside; in addition, a dozen men\r\nhad been killed during the fighting in the galleries. Everybody was\r\nshocked, except Klem Zareff, who had been in battles before. He was\r\nsurprised that the casualties had been so light.\r\n\r\nAt first glance, the spaceport looked like a handsome prize of\r\nvictory. The docks and workshops were all in good condition; at worst,\r\nthey only needed cleaning up. There was a collapsium plant, with its\r\nown mass-energy converter. There were foundries and machine-shops and\r\nforging-shops and a rolling-mill, almost completely robotic. At first,\r\nConn thought that it might be possible to build a hyperdrive ship\r\nhere, without having to go to Koshchei at all.\r\n\r\nCloser examination disabused him of this hope. There was nothing of\r\nwhich the framework of a ship could be built, and no way of producing\r\nheavy structural steel. The rolling-mill was good enough to turn out\r\neighth-inch sheet material which when plated with a few micromicrons\r\nof collapsium would be as good as a hundred feet of lead against\r\nspace-radiations, but that was the ship's skin. A ship needed a\r\nskeleton, too. The only thing to do was go on with the _Harriet\r\nBarne_.\r\n\r\nIt was sunset before he finished his tour of inspection and let his\r\njeep down in a vehicle hall off the lower gallery outside what had\r\noriginally been the spaceport officers' club. It was crowded, and a\r\nvictory celebration seemed to be getting under way. He saw his father\r\nwith Yves Jacquemont, Sylvie, Tom Brangwyn, and Captain Nichols.\r\nNichols had gotten clean clothes from the pirates' store of loot, and\r\nhad bathed and shaved. So had Jacquemont, though he had contented\r\nhimself with trimming his beard. It took him a second or so to\r\nrecognize the young lady in feminine garb as his erstwhile battle\r\ncomrade, Sylvie.\r\n\r\n\"Well, our pay goes on from the day we were captured,\" Nichols was\r\nsaying. \"My instructions are to resume command of the ship. Tomorrow,\r\nthey're sending a party out to go over her.\"\r\n\r\nConn stopped short. \"What's this about the ship?\"\r\n\r\n\"Captain Nichols was in screen contact with his company's office in\r\nStorisende,\" Rodney Maxwell said. \"They're continuing him in command\r\nof her.\"\r\n\r\n\"But ... but we took that ship! We lost three gunboats and about\r\ntwenty-five men....\"\r\n\r\n\"She still belongs to Transcontinent & Overseas,\" his father said.\r\n\"That's been the law on stolen property as long as there's been any\r\nlaw.\"\r\n\r\nOf course; he should have known that. Did know it; just didn't think.\r\n\r\n\"We broke an awful lot of eggs for no omelet; fought a battle for\r\nnothing.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, of course, I'm prejudiced,\" Sylvie said, \"but I don't think\r\ngetting us out of the hands of that bloodthirsty maniac and his\r\ncutthroats was nothing.\"\r\n\r\n\"Wiping out the Perales gang wasn't nothing, Conn,\" Tom Brangwyn said.\r\n\"You got no idea at all how bad things were, the last couple of\r\nyears.\"\r\n\r\n\"I know. I'm sorry.\" He was ashamed of himself. \"But I needed a ship,\r\nand now we have no ship at all.\"\r\n\r\n\"A ship means something to you?\" Yves Jacquemont asked.\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\" He told him why. \"If we could get to Koshchei, we could build a\r\nhypership of our own, and get our brandy and things to markets where\r\nwe could get a decent price for them.\"\r\n\r\n\"I know. I was in and out of Storisende on these owner-captain tramps\r\nfor a couple of years before I decided to retire and settle here,\"\r\nJacquemont said. \"The profit on a cargo of Poictesme brandy on Terra\r\nor Baldur is over a thousand percent.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, don't give up too soon,\" Nichols advised. \"You can't keep the\r\n_Harriet Barne_, of course, but you're entitled to prize-money on her,\r\nand that ought to buy you something you could build a spaceship out\r\nof.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's right,\" Jacquemont said. \"Everything else besides the frame\r\ncan be made here. Look, these pirates burned me out; except for the\r\nmoney I have in the bank, I lost everything, home, business and all.\r\nAs soon as I can find a place for Sylvie to stay, I'll come back and\r\ngo to work for your company building a spaceship. And a lot of the men\r\nwho were working here are farm-tramps and drifters, one job's as good\r\nas another as long as they get paid for it. And I know a few good men\r\nin Storisende--engineers--who'd be glad for a job, too.\"\r\n\r\n\"You think it would be all right with Mother and Flora if Sylvie\r\nstayed with us?\" Conn asked.\r\n\r\n\"Of course it would; they'd be glad to have her.\" Rodney Maxwell\r\nturned to Yves Jacquemont. \"Let's consider that fixed up. Now,\r\nsuppose you and I go into Storisende, and....\"\r\n\r\nThe Transcontinent & Overseas people arrived at Barathrum Spaceport\r\nthe next morning; a rear-rank vice-president, a front-rank\r\nlegal-eagle, and three engineers. They were horrified at what they\r\nsaw. The _Harriet Barne_ had been gutted. Bulkheads and decks had\r\nbeen ripped out and relocated incomprehensibly; the bridge and the\r\ncontrol room under it were gone; she had been stripped to her framework,\r\nand the whole underside was sheathed in shimmering collapsium.\r\n\r\n\"Great Ghu!\" the vice-president almost howled. \"That isn't _our_\r\nship!\"\r\n\r\n\"That's the _Harriet Barne_,\" her captain said. \"She looks a little\r\nragged now, but--\"\r\n\r\n\"You helped these pirates do this to her?\"\r\n\r\n\"If I hadn't, they'd have cut my throat and gotten somebody else to\r\nhelp them. My throat's more valuable to me than the ship is to you; I\r\ncan't get anybody to build me a new one.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, understand,\" one of the engineers said, \"they were converting\r\nher into an interplanetary ship. It wouldn't cost much to finish the\r\njob.\"\r\n\r\n\"We need an interplanetary ship like we need a hole in the head!\" The\r\nvice-president turned to Rodney Maxwell. \"Just how much prize-money do\r\nyou think you're entitled to for this wreck?\"\r\n\r\n\"I wouldn't know; that's up to Sterber, Flynn & Chen-Wong. Up to the\r\ncourt, if we can settle it any other way.\"\r\n\r\n\"You mean you'd litigate about this?\" the lawyer demanded, and began\r\nto laugh.\r\n\r\n\"If we have to. Look, if you people don't want her, sign her over to\r\nLitchfield Exploration & Salvage. But if you do want her, you'll have\r\nto pay for her.\"\r\n\r\n\"We'll give you twenty thousand sols,\" the lawyer said. \"We don't want\r\nto be tightfisted. After all, you fought a gang of pirates and lost\r\nsome men and a couple of boats; we have some moral obligation to you.\r\nBut you'll have to realize that this ship, in her present state, is\r\npractically valueless.\"\r\n\r\n\"The collapsium on her is worth twice that, and the engines are worth\r\neven more,\" Jacquemont said. \"I worked on them.\"\r\n\r\nThe discussion ended there. By midafternoon, Luther Chen-Wong, the\r\njunior partner of the law firm, arrived from Storisende with a couple\r\nof engineers of his own. Reporters began arriving; both sides were\r\nanxious to keep them away from the ship. Conn took care of them,\r\nassisted by Sylvie, who had rummaged an even more attractive costume\r\nout of what she called the loot-cellar. The reporters all used up a\r\nlot of film footage on her. And the Fawzis' Office Gang arrived from\r\nForce Command, bitterly critical of the value of the spaceport against\r\nits cost in lives and equipment. Brangwyn and Zareff returned to Force\r\nCommand with them. A Planetary Air Patrol ship arrived and removed the\r\ncaptured pirates. The liberated prisoners were airlifted to\r\nLitchfield.\r\n\r\nThe third day after the battle, Conn and his father and Sylvie and her\r\nfather flew to Litchfield. To Conn's surprise, Flora greeted him\r\ncordially, and Wade Lucas, rather stiffly, congratulated him. Maybe it\r\nwas as Tom Brangwyn had said; he hadn't been on Poictesme in the last\r\nfour or five years and didn't know how bad things had gotten. His\r\nmother seemed to think he had won the Battle of Barathrum\r\nsingle-handed.\r\n\r\nHe was even more surprised and gratified that Flora made friends with\r\nSylvie immediately. His mother, however, regarded the engineer's\r\ndaughter with badly concealed hostility, and seemed to doubt that\r\nSylvie was the kind of girl she wanted her son getting involved with.\r\nOutwardly, of course, she was quite gracious.\r\n\r\nRodney Maxwell and Yves Jacquemont flew to Storisende the next\r\nmorning, both more optimistic about finding a ship than Conn thought\r\nthe circumstances warranted. Conn stayed at home for the next few\r\ndays, luxuriating in idleness. He and Sylvie tore down his mother's\r\nhousehold robots and built sound-sensors into them, keying them to\r\nrespond to their names and to a few simple commands, and including\r\nrecorded-voice responses in a thick Sheshan accent. All the smart\r\npeople on Terra, he explained, had Sheshan humanoid servants.\r\n\r\nHis mother was delighted. Robots that would answer when she spoke to\r\nthem were a lot more companionable. She didn't seem to think, however,\r\nthat Sylvie's mechanical skills were ladylike accomplishments. Nice\r\ngirls, Litchfield model, weren't quite so handy with a spot-welder.\r\nThat was what Conn liked about Sylvie; she was like the girls he'd\r\nknown at the University.\r\n\r\nThey were strolling after dinner, down the Mall. The air was sharp and\r\nwarned that autumn had definitely arrived; the many brilliant stars,\r\nalmost as bright as the moon of Terra, were coming out in the dusk.\r\n\r\n\"Conn, this thing about Merlin,\" she began. \"Do you really believe in\r\nit? Ever since Dad and I came to Poictesme, I've been hearing about\r\nit, but it's just a story, isn't it?\"\r\n\r\nHe was tempted to tell her the truth, and sternly put the temptation\r\nbehind him.\r\n\r\n\"Of course there's a Merlin, Sylvie, and it's going to do wonderful\r\nthings when we find it.\"\r\n\r\nHe looked down the starlit Mall ahead of him. Somebody, maybe Lester\r\nDawes and Morgan Gatworth and Lorenzo Menardes, had gotten things\r\nfinished and cleaned up. The pavement was smooth and unbroken; the\r\nlitter had vanished.\r\n\r\n\"It's done wonderful things already, just because people started\r\nlooking for it,\" he said. \"Some of these days, they're going to\r\nrealize that they had Merlin all along and didn't know it.\"\r\n\r\nThere was a faint humming from somewhere ahead, and he was wondering\r\nwhat it was. Then they came to the long escalators, and he saw that\r\nthey were running.\r\n\r\n\"Why, look! They got them fixed! They're running!\"\r\n\r\nSylvie grinned at him and squeezed his arm.\r\n\r\n\"I get you, chum,\" she said. \"Of course there's a Merlin.\"\r\n\r\nMaybe he didn't have to tell her the truth.\r\n\r\nWhen they returned to the house, his mother greeted him:\r\n\r\n\"Conn, your father's been trying to get you ever since you went out.\r\nCall him, right away; Ritz-Gartner Hotel, in Storisende. It's\r\nsomething about a ship.\"\r\n\r\nIt look a little time to get his father on-screen. He was excited and\r\nhappy.\r\n\r\n\"Hi, Conn; we have one,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"What kind of a ship?\"\r\n\r\n\"You know her. The _Harriet Barne_.\"\r\n\r\nThat he hadn't expected. Something off Mothball Row that would have to\r\nbe flown to Barathrum and torn down and completely rebuilt, but not\r\nthe one that was there already, partly finished.\r\n\r\n\"How the dickens did you wangle that?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, it was Yves' idea, to start with. He knew about her; the T. &\r\nO.'s been losing money on her for years. He said if they had to pay\r\nprize-money on her and then either restore her to original condition\r\nor finish the job and build a spaceship they didn't want, it would\r\nalmost bankrupt the company. They got up as high as fifty thousand\r\nsols for prize-money and we just laughed at them. So we made a\r\nproposition of our own.\r\n\r\n\"We proposed organizing a new company, subsidiary to both L. E. & S.\r\nand T. & O., to engage in interplanetary shipping; both companies to\r\nassign their equity in the _Harriet Barne_ to the new company, the\r\nwork of completing her to be done at our spaceport and the labor cost\r\nto be shared. This would give us our spaceship, and get T. & O. off\r\nthe hook all around. Everybody was for it except the president of T. &\r\nO. Know anything about him?\"\r\n\r\nConn shook his head. His father continued:\r\n\r\n\"Name's Jethro Sastraman. He could play Scrooge in _Christmas Carol_\r\nwithout any makeup at all. He hasn't had a new idea since he got out\r\nof college, and that was while the War was still going on.\r\n'Preposterous; utterly visionary and impractical,'\" his father\r\nmimicked. \"Fortunately, a majority of the big stockholders didn't\r\nagree; they finally bullied him into agreeing. We're calling the new\r\ncompany Alpha-Interplanetary, we have an application for charter in,\r\nand that'll go through almost automatically.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who's going to be the president of this new company?\"\r\n\r\n\"You know him. Character named Rodney Maxwell. Yves is going to be\r\nvice-president in charge of operations; he's flying to Barathrum\r\ntomorrow or the next day with a gang of technicians we're recruiting.\r\nT. & O. are giving us Clyde Nichols and Mack Vibart, and a lot of men\r\nfrom their shipyard. I'm staying here in Storisende; we're opening an\r\noffice here. By this time next week, we're all going to wish we'd been\r\nborn quintuplets.\"\r\n\r\n\"And Conn Maxwell, I suppose, will be an influential\r\nnon-office-holding stockholder?\"\r\n\r\n\"That's right. Just like in L. E. & S.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXII\r\n\r\n\r\nHe found Jerry Rivas and Anse Dawes and a score of workmen making a\r\nsurvey and inventory of the spaceport. Captain Nichols and four of the\r\noriginal crew of the _Harriet Barne_, who had shared his captivity\r\namong the pirates, had stayed to take care of the ship. And Fred\r\nKarski, with one gun-cutter and a couple of light airboats, was\r\nkeeping up a routine guard. All of them had heard about the formation\r\nof Alpha-Interplanetary when Conn arrived.\r\n\r\nThe next day, Yves Jacquemont arrived, accompanied by Mack Vibart, a\r\ngang from the T. & O. shipyard, and a dozen engineers and construction\r\nmen whom he had recruited around Storisende. More workers arrived in\r\nthe next few days, including a number who had already worked on the\r\nship as slaves of the Perales gang.\r\n\r\nIt didn't take Conn long to appreciate the problems involved in the\r\nconversion. Built to operate only inside planetary atmosphere and\r\ngravitation, the _Harriet Barne_ was long and narrow, like an old\r\nocean ship; more than anything else, she had originally resembled a\r\nhuge submarine. Spaceships, either interplanetary or interstellar,\r\nwere always spherical with a pseudogravity system at the center. This,\r\nof course, the _Harriet Barne_ lacked.\r\n\r\n\"Well, are we going to make the whole trip in free fall?\" he wanted to\r\nknow.\r\n\r\n\"No, we'll use our acceleration for pseudograv halfway, and\r\ndeceleration the other half,\" Jacquemont told him. \"We'll be in free\r\nfall about ten or fifteen hours. What we're going to have to do will\r\nbe to lift off from Poictesme in the horizontal position the ship was\r\ndesigned for, and then make a ninety-degree turn after we're\r\noff-planet, with our lift and our drive working together, just like\r\none of the old rocket ships before the Abbott Drive was developed.\"\r\n\r\nThat meant, of course, that the after bulkheads would become decks,\r\nand explained a lot of the oddities he had noticed about the\r\nconversion job. It meant that everything would have to be mounted on\r\ngimbals, everything stowed so as to be secure in either position, and\r\nnothing placed where it would be out of reach in either.\r\n\r\nJacquemont and Nichols took charge of the work on the ship herself.\r\nChief Engineer Vibart, with a gang of half-taught, self-taught and\r\nuntaught helpers, went back to working the engines over, tearing out\r\nall the safety devices that were intended to keep the ship inside\r\nplanetary atmosphere, and arranging the lift engines so that they\r\ncould be swung into line with the drive engines. There was a lot of\r\ncybernetic and robotic equipment, and astrogational equipment, that\r\nhad to be made from scratch. Conn picked a couple of helpers and went\r\nto work on that.\r\n\r\nFrom time to time, he was able to snatch a few minutes to read\r\nteleprint papers or listen to audiovisual newscasts from Storisende.\r\nHe was always disappointed. There was much excitement about the new\r\ninterplanetary company, but the emphasis was all wrong. People weren't\r\ninterested in getting hyperships built, or opening the mines and\r\nfactories on Koshchei, or talking about all the things now in short\r\nsupply that could be produced there. They were talking about Merlin,\r\nand they were all positive, now, that something found at Force Command\r\nDuplicate had convinced Litchfield Exploration & Salvage that the\r\ngiant computer was somewhere off-planet.\r\n\r\nRodney Maxwell flew in from Storisende; he was accompanied by Wade\r\nLucas, who shook hands cordially with Conn.\r\n\r\n\"Can you spare us Jerry Rivas for a while?\" Rodney Maxwell asked.\r\n\r\n\"Well, ask Yves Jacquemont; he's vice-president in charge of\r\noperations. As an influential non-office-holding stockholder, I'd\r\nthink so. He's only running around helping out here and there.\"\r\n\r\n\"We want him to take charge of opening those hospitals you were\r\ntelling us about. Wade and I are forming a new company, Mainland\r\nMedical Materials, Ltd. Going to act as broker for L. E. & S. in\r\ngetting rid of medical stores. Nobody in the company knows where to\r\nsell that stuff or what we ought to get for it.\"\r\n\r\nWade Lucas began to talk about how desperately some types of drug and\r\nsome varieties of diagnostic equipment were needed. Conn had it on the\r\ntip of his tongue to ask Lucas whether he thought that was a racket,\r\ntoo. Lucas must have read his mind.\r\n\r\n\"I really didn't understand how much good this would do,\" he said. \"I\r\nwouldn't have spoken so forcefully against it if I had. I thought it\r\nwas nothing but this Merlin thing--\"\r\n\r\n\"Aaagh! Don't talk to me about Merlin!\" Conn interrupted. \"I have to\r\ntalk to Kurt Fawzi and that crowd about Merlin till I'm sick of the\r\nwhole subject.\"\r\n\r\nHis father shot him a warning glance; Lucas was looking at him in\r\nsurprise. He hastened to change the subject:\r\n\r\n\"I see Len made you a suit out of that material,\" he said to his\r\nfather. \"And I see you're not bulging the coat out behind with a\r\nhip-holster.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I stopped carrying a gun; I'm a city man, now. Nobody carries one\r\nin Storisende. Won't even be necessary in Litchfield before long. Our\r\nnew marshal had a regular reign of terror in Tramptown for a few days,\r\nand you wouldn't know the place. Wade, here, is acting mayor now.\"\r\n\r\nThey went back to talking about the new company. \"You're going to have\r\nso many companies you won't be able to to keep track of them before\r\nlong,\" Conn said.\r\n\r\n\"Well, I'm doing something about that. A holding company; Trisystem\r\nInvestments, Ltd.; you're a non-office-holding stockholder in that,\r\ntoo.\"\r\n\r\nMerlin was now a political issue. A bill had been introduced in\r\nParliament to amend the Abandoned Property Act of 867 and nationalize\r\nMerlin, when and if discovered and regardless by whom. The support\r\nseemed to come from an extremist minority; everybody else, including\r\nthe Administration, was opposed to it. There was considerable\r\nacrimony, however, on the propositions: 1) that Merlin was too\r\nimportant to the prosperity of Poictesme to become a private monopoly;\r\nand 2) that Merlin was too important, etc., to become a political\r\nfootball and patronage plum.\r\n\r\nIt was discovered, after they were half assembled, that the controls\r\nfor the _Harriet Barne_ would only work while she was in a horizontal\r\nposition. The whole thing had to be torn out and rebuilt. There was\r\nalso trouble with the air-and-water recycling system. The _City of\r\nNefertiti_ came in from Aton for Odin; Rodney Maxwell was almost\r\nfrantic because they hadn't gotten together a cargo of medical stores\r\nfrom the first hospital to be opened.\r\n\r\n\"There's all sorts of stuff,\" he was fuming, by screen. \"Stuff that's\r\nin short supply anywhere and that we could get good prices for\r\noff-planet. Get Federation sols for it, too.\"\r\n\r\n\"The _City of Asgard_ will be along in six months,\" Conn said. \"You\r\ncan have a real cargo assembled by then. You can make arrangements in\r\nadvance to dispose of it on Terra or Baldur or Marduk.\"\r\n\r\n\"There are a couple of other companies interested in interplanetary\r\nships now,\" his father added. \"One of them had gotten four old\r\nfreighters off Mothball Row, and they're tearing them down and\r\ncannibalizing them into one spaceship. That work's being done here at\r\nStorisende Spaceport. And another company has gotten title to a couple\r\nof old office buildings and has a gang at work dismantling them for\r\nthe structural steel. I think they're going to build a real\r\nspaceship.\"\r\n\r\nThat wasn't anything to worry about either. The _Harriet Barne_ was\r\nbetter than half finished. There was a collapsium plant at Storisende\r\nSpaceport, but Yves Jacquemont said it was only half the size of the\r\none at Barathrum; it would be three months before it could produce\r\narmor for one, let alone both, ships.\r\n\r\nThe crackpots were getting into the act, now, too. A spirit medium on\r\nthe continent of Acaire, to the north, had produced a communication\r\npurporting to originate with a deceased Third Force Staff officer, now\r\nin the Spirit World. There was considerable detail, all ludicrous to\r\nConn's professional ear. And a fanatic in one of the small towns on\r\nthe west coast was quoting the Bible, the Koran, and the Bhagavadgita\r\nto prove that if Merlin were ever found, Divine vengeance in a\r\nspectacular form would fall not only on Poictesme but on the entire\r\nGalaxy.\r\n\r\nThe spaceship that was building at Storisende got into the news;\r\non-screen, it appeared that the work was progressing rapidly. So was\r\nthe work of demolishing a block of empty buildings to get girders for\r\nthe second ship, on which work had not yet been started. The one under\r\nconstruction seemed to be of cruciform design, like an old-fashioned\r\npre-contragravity winged airplane. The design puzzled everybody at\r\nBarathrum. Yves Jacquemont thought that perhaps there would be decks\r\nin the cross-arm which would be used when the ship was running on\r\ncombined lift and drive.\r\n\r\n\"Well, till we can get a shipyard going on Koshchei and build some\r\nreal spaceships, there are going to be some rare-looking objects\r\ntraveling around the Alpha System. I wonder what the next one's going\r\nto look like--a flying sky-scraper?\" Conn said.\r\n\r\n\"What I wonder,\" Yves Jacquemont replied, \"is where all the old\r\ninterplanetary ships got to. There must have been hundreds of them\r\nrunning back and forth from here to Janicot and Koshchei and Jurgen\r\nand Horvendile during the War. They must have gone somewhere.\"\r\n\r\n\"Couldn't they all have been fitted with Dillingham hyperdrive\r\nengines and used in the evacuation?\"\r\n\r\n\"Possible. But the average interplanetary ship isn't very big; five\r\nhundred to seven-fifty feet in diameter. One of those things couldn't\r\ncarry more than a couple of hundred people, after you put in all the\r\nsupplies and the hydroponic tanks and carniculture vats and so on for\r\na four- to six-month voyage. I can't see the economy of altering\r\nanything that small for interstellar work. Why, the smallest of these\r\ntramp freighters that come in here will run about fifteen hundred\r\nfeet.\"\r\n\r\nThey didn't just disintegrate when peace broke out, that was for sure.\r\nAnd there certainly weren't any of them left on Poictesme. He puzzled\r\nover it briefly, then shoved it aside. He had more important things to\r\nthink about.\r\n\r\nIn his spare time he was studying, along with his other work,\r\neverything he could find on Koshchei, with an intensity he had not\r\ngiven to anything since cramming for examinations at the University.\r\nThere was a lot of it.\r\n\r\nThe fourth planet of Alpha Gartner was older than Poictesme;\r\ngeologists claimed that it was the oldest thing, the sun excepted, in\r\nthe system, and astrophysicists were far from convinced that it hadn't\r\nbeen captured from either Beta or Gamma when the three stars had been\r\nmuch closer together. It had certainly been formed at a much higher\r\ntemperature than Janicot or Poictesme or Jurgen or Horvendile. For\r\nbetter than a billion years, it had been molten-hot, and it had lost\r\nmost of its lighter elements in gaseous form along with its primary\r\natmosphere, leaving little to form a light-rock crust. All that had\r\nremained had been a core of almost pure iron and a mantle that was\r\nmostly high-grade iron ore.\r\n\r\nThe same process had gone on, as it cooled, as on any Terra-size\r\nplanet. After the surface had started to congeal, gases, mostly carbon\r\ndioxide and water vapor, had come up to form a secondary atmosphere,\r\nthe water vapor forming a cloud envelope, condensing, and sending down\r\nrain that returned immediately as steam. Solar radiations and electric\r\ndischarges broke some of that into oxygen and hydrogen; most of the\r\nhydrogen escaped into space. Finally, the surface cooled further and\r\nthe rain no longer steamed off.\r\n\r\nThe whole planet started to rust. It had been rusting, slowly, for the\r\nbillion or so years that had followed, and almost all the free oxygen\r\nhad become locked in iron oxide. The air was almost pure carbon\r\ndioxide. It would have been different if life had ever appeared on\r\nKoshchei, but apparently the right amino acids never assembled. Some\r\nattempts had been made to introduce vegetation after the colonization\r\nof Poictesme, but they had all failed.\r\n\r\nMen went to Koshchei; they worked out of doors in oxygen helmets, and\r\nlived in airtight domes and generated their own oxygen. There had been\r\nmines, and smelters, and blast furnaces and steel mills. And there had\r\nbeen shipyards, where hyperships up to three thousand feet had been\r\nbuilt. They had all been abandoned when the War had ended; they were\r\nwaiting there, on an empty, lifeless planet. Some of them had been\r\nbuilt by the Third Fleet-Army Force during the War; most of them dated\r\nback almost a century before that, to the original industrial boom.\r\nAll of them could be claimed under the Abandoned Property Act of 867,\r\nsince all had been taken over by the Federation, and the original\r\nowners, or their heirs, compensated.\r\n\r\nAnd there was the matter of selecting a crew. As an influential\r\nnon-office-holding stockholder in all the companies involved, Conn\r\nMaxwell, of course, would represent them. He would also serve as\r\nastrogator. Clyde Nichols would command the ship in atmosphere, and\r\nact as first mate in space. Mack Vibart would be chief engineer at all\r\ntimes. Yves Jacquemont would be first officer under Nichols, and\r\ncaptain outside atmosphere. They had three real space crewmen, named\r\nRoddell, Youtsko and O'Keefe, who had been in Storisende jail as a\r\nresult of a riotous binge when their ship had lifted out, six months\r\nbefore. The rest of the company--Jerry Rivas, Anse Dawes, Charley\r\nGatworth, Mohammed Matsui, and four other engineers, Ludvyckson,\r\nGomez, Karanja and Retief--rated as ordinary spacemen for the trip,\r\nand would do most of the exploration work after landing.\r\n\r\nThey got the controls put up; they would work in either position. The\r\nengines were lifted in and placed. Conn finished the robo-pilot and\r\nthe astrogational computers and saw them installed. The air-and-water\r\nrecycling system went in. The collapsium armor went on. In the\r\nnews-screen, they saw the spaceship at Storisende still far from half\r\nfinished, with swarms of heavy-duty lifters and contragravity\r\nmachiners around it, and a set of landing-stands, on which the second\r\nship was to be built, in the process of construction.\r\n\r\nA tramp hyperspace freighter landed at Storisende, the _Andromeda_,\r\nfive months from Terra, with a cargo of general merchandise. Rodney\r\nMaxwell and Wade Lucas had assembled a cargo of medicines and hospital\r\nequipment which they thought could be sold profitably. They began\r\ndickering with the owner-captain of the hypership.\r\n\r\nA farm-tramp down in the tobacco country to the south, evidently\r\nignorant that the former commander of the Third Force was still alive,\r\nhad proclaimed himself to be the reincarnation of Foxx Travis and was\r\nforbidding everybody, on pain of court-martial and firing squad, from\r\nmeddling with Merlin. And an evangelist in the west was declaring that\r\nMerlin was really Satan in mechanical shape.\r\n\r\nThe _Harriet Barne_ was finished. The first test, lifting her to three\r\nhundred miles, turning her bow-up, and taking her another thousand\r\nmiles, had been a success. They brought her back and set her down in\r\nthe middle of the crater, and began getting the supplies aboard. Kurt\r\nFawzi, Klem Zareff, Judge Ledue, Franz Veltrin and the others flew\r\nover from Force Command. Sylvie Jacquemont came from Litchfield, and\r\nso did Wade Lucas, Morgan Gatworth, Lester Dawes, Lorenzo Menardes and\r\na number of others. Neither Conn's mother nor sister came.\r\n\r\n\"I don't know what's the matter with those two,\" Sylvie told him.\r\n\"They always seem to be scrapping with each other now, and the only\r\nthing they can agree on is that you and your father ought to stop\r\nwhatever you're doing, right away. Your mother can't adjust to your\r\nfather being a big Storisende businessman, and she says he'll lose\r\nevery centisol he has and both of you will probably go to jail, and\r\nthen she's afraid you will find Merlin, and Flora's sure you and your\r\nfather are swindling everybody on the planet.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sylvie, I had no idea things would be like that,\" he told her\r\ncontritely. \"I wish I hadn't suggested that you stay there, now.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, it isn't so bad, so far. Your mother and I get along all right\r\nwhen Flora isn't there, and Flora and I get along when your mother\r\nisn't around. Mealtimes aren't much fun, though.\"\r\n\r\nHis father came out from Storisende, looked the ship over, and seemed\r\nrelieved.\r\n\r\n\"I'm glad you're ready to get off,\" he said. \"You know this hyperspace\r\nfreighter, the _Andromeda_? Some private group in Storisende has\r\nchartered her. She's loading supplies now. I have a private detective\r\nagency, Barton-Massarra, trying to find out where's she's going. I\r\nthink you'd better get this ship off, right away.\"\r\n\r\n\"We have everything aboard, all the supplies and everything,\"\r\nJacquemont told him. \"We can lift off tonight.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\n\r\nThe ship lurched slightly. In the outside screens, the lights around,\r\nthe crowd that was waving good-bye, and the floor of the crater began\r\nreceding. The sound pickups were full of cheering, and the boom of a\r\nbig gun at one of the top batteries, and the recorded and amplified\r\nmusic of a band playing the traditional \"Spacemen's Hymn.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's been a long time since I heard that played in earnest,\"\r\nJacquemont said. \"Well, we're off to see the Wizard.\"\r\n\r\nThe lights dwindled and merged into a tiny circle in the darkness of\r\nthe crater. The music died away; the cannon shots became a faint\r\nthrobbing. Finally, there was silence, and only the stars above and\r\nthe dark land and the starlit sea below. After a long while a sunset\r\nglow, six hours past on Barathrum, appeared in the west, behind the\r\nnow appreciable curvature of the planet.\r\n\r\n\"Stand by for shift to vertical,\" Captain Nichols called, his voice\r\nechoing from PA-outlets through the ship.\r\n\r\n\"Ready for shift, Captain Nichols,\" Jacquemont reported from the\r\nduplicate-control panel.\r\n\r\nConn went to the after bulkhead, leaning his back against it. \"Ready\r\nhere, Captain,\" he said.\r\n\r\nOther voices took it up. Lights winked on the control panels.\r\n\r\n\"Shifting over,\" Nichols said. \"Your ship now, Captain Jacquemont.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank you, Mr. Nichols.\"\r\n\r\nThe deck began to tilt, and then he was lying on his back, his feet\r\nagainst the side of the control room, which had altered its shape and\r\ndimensions. There was a jar as the drive went on in line with the new\r\ndirection of the lift and the ship began accelerating. He got to his\r\nfeet, and he and Charley Gatworth went to the astrogational computer\r\nand began checking the data and setting the course for the point in\r\nspace at which Koshchei would be in a hundred and sixty hours.\r\n\r\n\"Course set, Captain,\" he reported to Jacquemont, after a while.\r\n\r\nA couple of lights winked on the control panel. There was nothing more\r\nto do but watch Poictesme dwindle behind, and listen to the newscasts,\r\nand take turns talking to friends on the planet.\r\n\r\nThey approached the halfway point; the acceleration rate decreased,\r\nand the gravity indicator dropped, little by little. Everybody was\r\nenjoying the new sense of lightness, romping and skylarking like newly\r\nlanded tourists on Luna. It was fun, as long as they landed on their\r\nfeet at each jump, and the food and liquids stayed on plates and in\r\nglasses and cups. Yves Jacquemont began posting signs in conspicuous\r\nplaces:\r\n\r\nWEIGHT IS WHAT YOU LIFT, MASS IS WHAT HURTS\r\nWHEN IT HITS YOU.\r\nWEIGHT DEPENDS ON GRAVITY; MASS IS ALWAYS CONSTANT.\r\n\r\nHis father came on-screen from his office in Storisende. By then,\r\nthere was a 30-second time lag in communication between the ship and\r\nPoictesme.\r\n\r\n\"My private detectives found out about the _Andromeda_,\" he said.\r\n\"She's going to Panurge, in the Gamma System. They have a couple of\r\ncomputermen with them, one they hired from the Stock Exchange, and one\r\nthey practically shanghaied away from the Government. And some of the\r\npeople who chartered the ship are members of a family that were\r\ninterested in a positronic-equipment plant on Panurge at the time of\r\nthe War.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's all right, then; we don't need to worry about that any more.\r\nThey're just hunting for Merlin.\"\r\n\r\nSome of his companions were looking at him curiously. A little later,\r\nPiet Ludvyckson, the electromagnetics engineer, said: \"I thought you\r\nwere looking for Merlin, Conn.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not on Koschchei. We're looking for something to build a hypership\r\nout of. If I had Merlin in my hip pocket right now, I'd trade it for\r\none good ship like the _City of Asgard_ or the _City of Nefertiti_,\r\nand give a keg of brandy and a box of cigars to boot. If we had a ship\r\nof our own, we'd be selling lots of both, and not for Storisende\r\nSpaceport prices, either.\"\r\n\r\n\"But don't you think Merlin's important?\" Charley Gatworth, who had\r\noverheard him, asked.\r\n\r\n\"Sure. If we find Merlin, we can run it for President. It would make a\r\nbetter one than Jake Vyckhoven.\"\r\n\r\nHe let it go at that. Plenty of opportunities later to expand the\r\ntheme.\r\n\r\nThe gravitation gauge dropped to zero. Now they were in free fall, and\r\nit lasted twice as long as Yves Jacquemont had predicted. There were a\r\nfew misadventures, none serious and most of them comic--For example,\r\nwhen Jerry Rivas opened a bottle of beer, everybody was chasing the\r\namber globules and catching them in cups, and those who were splashed\r\nwere glad it hadn't been hot coffee.\r\n\r\nThey made their second, 180-degree turnover while weightless. Then\r\nthey began decelerating and approached Koshchei stern-on, and the\r\ngravity gauge began climbing slowly up again, and things began\r\nstaying put, and they were walking instead of floating. Koshchei grew\r\nlarger and larger ahead; the polar icecaps, and the faint dappling of\r\nclouds, and the dark wiggling lines on the otherwise uniform red-brown\r\nsurface which were mountain ranges became visible. Finally they began\r\nto see, first with the telescopic screens and then without\r\nmagnification, the little dots and specks that were cities and\r\nindustrial centers.\r\n\r\nThen they were in atmosphere, and Jacquemont made the final shift, to\r\nhorizontal position, and turned the ship over to Nichols.\r\n\r\nFor a moment, the scout-boat tumbled away from the ship and Conn was\r\nback in free fall. Then he got on the lift-and-drive and steadied it,\r\nand pressed the trigger button, firing a green smoke bomb. Beside him,\r\nYves Jacquemont put on the radio and the screen pickups. He could see\r\nthe ship circling far above, and the manipulator-boat, with its\r\nclaw-arms and grapples, breaking away from it. Then he looked down on\r\nthe endless desert of iron oxide that stretched in all directions to\r\nthe horizon, until he saw a spot, optically the size of a\r\nfive-centisol piece, that was the shipbuilding city of Port Carpenter.\r\nHe turned the boat toward it, firing four more green smokes at\r\nthree-second intervals. The manipulator-boat started to follow, and\r\nthe _Harriet Barne_, now a distant speck in the sky, began coming\r\ncloser.\r\n\r\nBelow, as he cut speed and altitude, he could see the pock-marks of\r\nopen-pit mines and the glint of sunlight on bright metal and\r\narmor-glass roofs, the blunt conical stacks of nuclear furnaces and\r\nthe twisted slag-flows, like the ancient lava-flows of Barathrum. And,\r\nhe reflected, he was an influential non-office-holding stockholder in\r\nevery bit of it, as soon as they could screen Storisende and get\r\nclaims filed.\r\n\r\nA high tower rose out of the middle of Port Carpenter, with a\r\nglass-domed mushroom top. That would be the telecast station; the\r\nadministrative buildings were directly below it and around its base.\r\nHe came in slowly over the city, above a spaceport with its empty\r\nlanding pits in a double circle around a traffic-control building,\r\nand airship docks and warehouses beyond. More steel mills. Factories,\r\neither hemispherical domes or long buildings with rounded tops.\r\nShip-construction yards and docks; for the most part, these were\r\nempty, but on some of them the landing-stands of spaceships, like\r\neight-and ten-legged spiders, waiting for forty years for hulls to be\r\nbuilt on them. A few spherical skeletons of ships, a few with some of\r\nthe outer skin on. It wasn't until he was passing close to them that\r\nhe realized how huge they were. And stacks of material--sheet steel,\r\ndeckplate, girders--and contragravity lifters and construction\r\nmachines, all left on jobs that were never finished, the bright\r\nrustless metal dulled by forty years of rain and windblown red dust.\r\nThey must have been working here to the very last, and then, when the\r\nevacuation elsewhere was completed, they had dropped whatever they\r\nwere doing, piled into such ships as were completed, and lifted away.\r\n\r\nThe mushroom-topped tower rose from the middle of a circular building\r\npiled level on level, almost half a mile across. He circled over it,\r\nsaw an airship dock, and called the _Harriet Barne_ while Jacquemont\r\ntalked to Jerry Rivas, piloting the manipulator-boat. Rivas came in\r\nand joined them in the air; they hovered over the dock and helped the\r\nship down when she came in, nudging her into place.\r\n\r\nBy the time Conn and Jacquemont and Rivas and Anse Dawes and Roddell\r\nand Youtsko and Karanja were out on the dock in oxygen helmets, the\r\nship's airlock was opening and Nichols and Vibart and the others were\r\ncoming out, towing a couple of small lifters loaded with equipment.\r\n\r\nThe airlocked door into the building, at the end of the dock, was\r\nclosed; when somebody pulled the handle, it refused to open. That\r\nmeant it was powered from the central power plant, wherever that was.\r\nThere was a plug socket beside it, with the required voltage marked\r\nover it. They used an extension line from a power unit on one of the\r\nlifters to get it open, and did the same with the inner door; when it\r\nwas open, they passed into a dim room that stretched away ahead of\r\nthem and on either side.\r\n\r\nIt looked like a freight-shipping room; there were a few piles of\r\nboxes and cases here and there, and a litter of packing material\r\neverywhere. A long counter-desk, and a bank of robo-clerks behind it.\r\nAccording to the air-analyzer, the oxygen content inside was safely\r\nhigh. They all pulled off their fishbowl helmets and slung them.\r\n\r\n\"Well, we can bunk inside here tonight,\" somebody said. \"It won't be\r\nso crowded here.\"\r\n\r\n\"We'll bunk here after we find the power plant and get the ventilator\r\nfans going,\" Jacquemont said.\r\n\r\nAnse Dawes held up the cigarette he had lighted; that was all the\r\nair-analyzer he needed.\r\n\r\n\"That looks like enough oxygen,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, it makes its own ventilation; convection,\" Jacquemont said. \"But\r\nyou go to sleep in here, and you'll smother in a big puddle of your\r\nown exhaled CO_2. Just watch what the smoke from that cigarette's\r\ndoing.\"\r\n\r\nThe smoke was hanging motionless a few inches from the hot ash on the\r\nend of the cigarette.\r\n\r\n\"We'll have to find the power plant, then,\" Matsui, the power-engineer\r\nsaid. \"Down at the bottom and in the middle, I suppose, and anybody's\r\nguess how deep this place goes.\"\r\n\r\n\"We'll find plans of the building,\" Jerry Rivas said. \"Any big dig\r\nI've ever been on, you could always find plans. The troubleshooters\r\nalways had them; security officer, and maintenance engineer.\"\r\n\r\nThere were inside-use vehicles in the big room; they loaded what they\r\nhad with them onto a couple of freight-skids and piled on, starting\r\ndown a passage toward the center of the building. The passageways were\r\nwell marked with direction-signs, and they found the administrative\r\narea at the top and center, around the base of the telecast-tower. The\r\nsecurity offices, from which police, military guard, fire protection\r\nand other emergency services were handled, had a fine set of plans and\r\nmaps, not only for the building itself but for everything else in Port\r\nCarpenter. The power plant, as Matsui had surmised, was at the very\r\nbottom, directly below.\r\n\r\nThe only trouble, after they found it, was that it was completely\r\ndead. The reactors wouldn't react, the converters wouldn't convert,\r\nand no matter how many switches they shoved in, there was no power\r\noutput. The inside telemetered equipment, of course, was self-powered.\r\nSome of them were dead, too, but from those which still worked\r\nMohammed Matsui got a uniformly disheartening story.\r\n\r\n\"You know what happened?\" he said. \"When this gang bugged out, back in\r\n854, they left the power on. Now the conversion mass is all gone, and\r\nthe plutonium's all spent. We'll have to find more plutonium, and tear\r\nthis whole thing down and refuel it, and repack the mass-conversion\r\nchambers--provided nothing's eaten holes in itself after the mass\r\ninside was all converted.\"\r\n\r\n\"How long will it take?\" Conn asked.\r\n\r\n\"If we can find plutonium, and if we can find robots to do the work\r\ninside, and if there's been no structural damage, and if we keep at\r\nit--a couple of days.\"\r\n\r\n\"All right; let's get at it. I don't know where we'll find shipyards\r\nlike these anywhere else, and if we do, things'll probably be as bad\r\nthere. We came here to fix things up and start them, didn't we?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIV\r\n\r\n\r\nIt didn't take as long as Mohammed Matsui expected. They found the\r\nfissionables magazine, and in it plenty of plutonium, each\r\nsubcritical slug in a five-hundred-pound collapsium canister. There\r\nwere repair-robots, and they only had to replace the cartridges in the\r\npower units of three of them. They sent them inside the\r\ncollapsium-shielded death-to-people area--transmitter robots, to relay\r\nwhat the others picked up through receptors wire-connected with the\r\noutside; foremen-robots, globes a yard in diameter covered with horns\r\nand spikes like old-fashioned ocean-navy mines; worker-robots, in a\r\nvariety of shapes, but mostly looking like many-clawed crabs.\r\n\r\nNeither the converter nor the reactor had sustained any damage while\r\nthe fissionables were burning out. So the robots began tearing out\r\nreactor-elements, and removing plutonium slugs no longer capable of\r\nsustaining chain reaction but still dangerously radioactive. Nuclear\r\nreactors had become simpler and easier to service since the First Day\r\nof the Year Zero, when Enrico Fermi put the first one into operation,\r\nbut the principles remained the same. Work was less back-breaking and\r\nmuscle-straining, but it called for intense concentration on screens\r\nand meters and buttons that was no less exhausting.\r\n\r\nThe air around them began to grow foul. Finally, the air-analyzer\r\nsquawked and flashed red lights to signal that the oxygen had dropped\r\nbelow the safety margin. They had no mobile fan equipment, or time to\r\nhunt any; they put on their fishbowl helmets and went back to work.\r\nAfter twelve hours, with a few short breaks, they had the reactors\r\ngoing. Jerry Rivas and a couple of others took a heavy-duty lifter and\r\nwent looking for conversion mass; they brought back a couple of tons\r\nof scrap-iron and fed it to the converters. A few seconds after it was\r\nin, the pilot lights began coming on all over the panels. They took\r\ntwo more hours to get the oxygen-separator and the ventilator fans\r\ngoing, and for good measure they started the water pumps and the\r\nheating system. Then they all went outside to the ship to sleep. The\r\nsun was just coming up.\r\n\r\nIt was sunset when they rose and returned to the building. The\r\nairlocks opened at a touch on the operating handles. Inside, the air\r\nwas fresh and sweet, the temperature was a pleasantly uniform 75\r\ndegrees Fahrenheit, the fans were humming softly, and there was\r\nrunning hot and cold water everywhere.\r\n\r\nJerry Rivas, Anse Dawes, and the three tramp freighter fo'c'sle hands\r\ntook lifters and equipment and went off foraging. The rest of them\r\nwent to the communications center to get the telecast station, the\r\nradio beacon, and the inside-screen system into operation. There were\r\na good many things that had to be turned on manually, and more things\r\nthat had been left on, forty years ago, and now had to be repowered or\r\nreplaced. They worked at it most of the night; before morning, almost\r\neverything was working, and they were sending a signal across\r\ntwenty-eight million miles to Storisende, on Poictesme.\r\n\r\nIt was late evening, Storisende time, but Rodney Maxwell, who must\r\nhave been camping beside his own screen, came on at once, which is to\r\nsay five and a half minutes later.\r\n\r\n\"Well, I see you got in somewhere. Where are you, and how is\r\neverything?\"\r\n\r\nThen he picked up a cigar out of an ashtray in front of him and lit\r\nit, waiting.\r\n\r\n\"Port Carpenter; we're in the main administration building,\" Conn told\r\nhim. He talked for a while about what they had found and done since\r\ntheir arrival. \"Have you an extra viewscreen, fitted for recording?\"\r\nhe asked.\r\n\r\nFive and a half minutes later, his father nodded. \"Yes, right here.\"\r\nHe leaned forward and away from the communication screen in front of\r\nhim. \"I have it on.\" He gave the wave-length combination. \"Ready to\r\nreceive.\"\r\n\r\n\"This is about all we have, now. Views we took coming in, from the\r\nship and a scout-boat.\" He started transmitting them. \"We haven't sent\r\nin any claims yet. I wasn't sure whether I should make them for\r\nAlpha-Interplanetary, or Litchfield Exploration & Salvage.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't bother sending in anything to the Claims Office,\" his father\r\nsaid. \"Send anything you want to claim in here to me, and I'll have\r\nSterber, Flynn & Chen-Wong file them. They'll be made for a new\r\ncompany we're organizing.\"\r\n\r\n\"What? Another one?\"\r\n\r\nHis father nodded, grinning. \"Koshchei Exploitation & Development;\r\nwe've made application already. We can't claim exclusive rights to the\r\nwhole planet, like the old interstellar exploration companies did\r\nbefore the War, but since you're the only people on the planet, we can\r\ncome pretty close to it by detail.\" He was looking to one side, at the\r\nother screen. \"Great Ghu, Conn! This place of yours all together\r\nbeats everything I ever dug, Force Command and Barathrum Spaceport\r\nincluded. How big would you say it is? More than ten miles in radius?\"\r\n\r\n\"About five or six. Ten or twelve miles across.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's all right, then. We'll just claim the building you're in, now,\r\nand the usual ten-mile radius, the same as at Force Command. We'll\r\nclaim the place as soon as the company's chartered; in the meantime,\r\nsend in everything else you can get views of.\"\r\n\r\nThey set up a regular radio-and-screen watch after that. Charley\r\nGatworth and Piet Ludvyckson, both of whom were studying astrogation\r\nin hopes of qualifying as space officers after they had a real\r\nspaceship, elected themselves to that duty; it gave them plenty of\r\ntime for study. Jerry Rivas and Anse Dawes, with whomever they could\r\nfind to help them, were making a systematic search. They looked first\r\nof all for foodstuffs, and found enough in the storerooms of three\r\nrestaurants on the executive level to feed their own party in gourmet\r\nstyle for a year, and enough in the main storerooms to provision an\r\narmy. They even found refrigerators and freeze-bins full of meat and\r\nvegetables fresh after forty years. That surprised everybody, for the\r\npower units had gone dead long ago. Then it was noticed that they were\r\ncovered with collapsium. Anything that would stop cosmic rays was a\r\nhundred percent efficient as a heat insulator.\r\n\r\nComing in, the first day, Conn had seen an almost completed hypership\r\nbulking above the domes and roofs of Port Carpenter in the distance.\r\nHe saw it again on screen from a pickup atop the central tower. As\r\nsoon as the party was comfortably settled in the executive apartments\r\non the upper levels, he and Yves Jacquemont and Mack Vibart and Schalk\r\nRetief, the construction engineer, found an aircar in one of the\r\nhangars and went to have a closer look at her.\r\n\r\nShe had all her collapsium on, except for a hundred-foot circle at the\r\ntop and a number of rectangular openings around the sides. Yves\r\nJacquemont said that would be where the airlocks would go.\r\n\r\n\"They always put them on last. But don't be surprised at anything you\r\nfind or don't find inside. As soon as the skeleton's up they put the\r\narmor on, and then build the rest of the ship out from the middle. It\r\nmight be slower getting material in through the airlock openings, but\r\nit holds things together while they're working.\"\r\n\r\nThey put on the car's lights, lifted to the top, and let down through\r\nthe upper opening. It was like entering a huge globular spider's web,\r\nglobe within globe of interlaced girders and struts and braces,\r\nextending from the center to the outer shell. Even the spider was\r\nhome--a three-hundred-foot ball of collapsium, looking tiny at the\r\nvery middle.\r\n\r\n\"Why, this isn't a ship!\" Vibart cried in disgust. \"This is just the\r\noutside of a ship. They haven't done a thing inside.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, yes, they have,\" Jacquemont contradicted, aiming a spotlight\r\ntoward the shimmering ball in the middle. \"They have all the engines\r\nin--Abbott lift-and-drive, Dillingham hyperdrives, pseudograv, power\r\nreactors, converters, everything. They wouldn't have put on the\r\nshielding if they hadn't. They did that as soon as they had the\r\noutside armor on.\"\r\n\r\n\"Wonder why they didn't finish her, if they got that far,\" Retief\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\n\"They didn't need her. They'd had it; they wanted to go home.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, we're not going to finish her, not with any fifteen men,\"\r\nRetief said. \"One man has only two hands, two feet and one brain; he\r\ncan only handle so much robo-equipment at a time.\"\r\n\r\n\"I never expected we'd build a ship ourselves,\" Conn said. \"We came to\r\nlook the place over and get a few claims staked. When we've done that,\r\nwe'll go back and get a real gang together.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know where you'll find them,\" Jacquemont commented. \"We'll\r\nneed a couple of hundred, and they ought all to be graduate engineers.\r\nWe can't do this job with farm-tramps.\"\r\n\r\n\"You made some good shipyard men out of farm-tramps on Barathrum.\"\r\n\r\n\"And what'll you do for supervisors?\"\r\n\r\n\"You're one. General superintendent. Mack, you and Schalk are a couple\r\nof others. You just keep a day ahead of your men in learning the job,\r\nyou'll do all right.\"\r\n\r\nVibart turned to Jacquemont. \"You know, Yves, he'll do it,\" he said.\r\n\"He doesn't know how impossible this is, and when we try to tell him,\r\nhe won't believe us. You can't stop a guy like that. All right, Conn;\r\ndeal me in.\"\r\n\r\n\"I won't let anybody be any crazier than I am,\" Jacquemont declared,\r\nand then looked around the vastness of the empty ship with its\r\nlacework of steel. \"All you need is about ten million square feet of\r\ndecks and bulkheads, an air-and-water system, hydroponic tanks and\r\ncarniculture vats, astrogation and robo-pilot equipment, about which I\r\nknow very little, a hyperspace pilot system, about which I know\r\nnothing at all.... Conn, why don't you just build a new Merlin? It\r\nwould be simpler.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't want a new Merlin. I'm not even interested in the original\r\nMerlin. This is what I want, right here.\"\r\n\r\nHe told his father, by screen, about the ship. \"I believe we can\r\nfinish her, but not with the gang that's here. We'll need a couple of\r\nhundred men. Now, with the supplies we've found, we can stay here\r\nindefinitely. Should we do more exploring and claim some more of these\r\nplaces, or should we come home right away and start recruiting, and\r\nthen come back with a large party, start work on the ship, and explore\r\nand make further claims as we have time?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"Better come back as soon as possible. Just explore Port Carpenter,\r\nfind out what's going to be needed to finish the ship and what\r\nfacilities you have to produce it, and get things cleaned up a little\r\nso that you can start work as soon as you have people to do it. I'm\r\norganizing another company--don't laugh, now; I've only started\r\npromotioneering--which I think we will call Trisystem & Interstellar\r\nSpacelines. Get me all the views you can of the ship herself and of\r\nthe steel mills and that sort of thing that will produce material for\r\nfinishing her; I want to use them in promotion. By the way, has she a\r\nname?\"\r\n\r\n\"Only a shipyard construction number.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then suppose you call her _Ouroboros_, after Genji Gartner's old\r\nship, the one that discovered the Trisystem.\"\r\n\r\n\"_Ouroboros II_; that's fine. Will do.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good. I'll have Sterber, Flynn & Chen-Wong make application for a\r\ncharter right away. We'll have to make Alpha-Interplanetary one of the\r\nstockholding companies, and also Koschchei Exploitation & Development,\r\nand, of course, Litchfield Exploration & Salvage....\"\r\n\r\nIt was a pity there really wasn't a Merlin. If this kept on nothing\r\nelse would be able to figure out who owned how much stock in what.\r\n\r\nThey found the on-the-job engineering office for the ship in a small\r\ndome half a mile from the construction dock. Yves Jacquemont and Mack\r\nVibart and Schalk Retief moved in and buried themselves to the ears in\r\nspecifications and blueprints. The others formed into parties of three\r\nor four, and began looking about production facilities for material.\r\nThere was a steel mill a mile from the construction site; it was\r\nalmost fully robotic. Iron ore went in at one end, and finished sheet\r\nsteel and girders and deck plates came out at the other, and a dozen\r\nmen could handle the whole thing. There was a collapsium plant; there\r\nwere machine-shops and forging-shops. Every time they finished\r\ninspecting one, Yves Jacquemont would have a list of half a dozen more\r\nplants that he wanted found and examined yesterday morning at the\r\nlatest.\r\n\r\nSome of them were in a frightful mess; work had been suspended and\r\neverybody had gone away leaving everything as it was. Some were in\r\nperfect order, ready to go into operation again as soon as power was\r\nput on. It had depended, apparently, upon the personal character of\r\nwhoever had been in charge in the end. The nuclear-electric power unit\r\nplant was in the latter class. The man in charge of it evidently\r\nhadn't believed in leaving messes behind, even if he didn't expect to\r\ncome back.\r\n\r\nIt was built in the shape of a T. One side of the cross-stroke\r\ncontained the cartridge-case plant, where presses formed sheet-steel\r\ncylinders, some as small as a round of pistol ammunition and some the\r\nsize of ten-gallon kegs. They moved toward the center on a production\r\nline, finally reaching a matter-collapser where they were plated with\r\ncollapsium. From the other side, radioactive isotopes, mostly\r\nreactor-waste, came in through evacuated and collapsium-shielded\r\nchambers, were sorted, and finally, where the cross-arm of the T\r\njoined the downstroke, packed in the collapsium cases. The production\r\nline continued at right angles down the long building in which the\r\napparatus which converted nuclear energy to electric current was\r\nassembled and packed; at the end, the finished power cartridges came\r\noff, big ones for heavy machines and tiny ones for things like hand\r\ntools and pocket lighters and razors. There were stacks of them, in\r\nall sizes, loaded on skids and ready to move out. Except for the\r\nminute and unavoidable leakage of current, they were as good as the\r\nday they were assembled, and would be for another century.\r\n\r\nLike almost everything else, the power-cartridge plant was airtight\r\nand had its own oxygen-generator. The air-analyzer reported the oxygen\r\ninsufficient to support life. That was understandable; there were a\r\nlot of furnaces which had evidently been hot when the power was cut\r\noff; they had burned up the oxygen before cooling. They put on their\r\noxygen equipment when they got out of the car.\r\n\r\n\"I'll go back and have a look at the power plant,\" Matsui said. \"If\r\nit's like the rest of this place, it'll be ready to go as soon as the\r\nreactors are started. I wish everybody here had left things like\r\nthis.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, we'll have to check everything to make sure nothing was left on\r\nwhen the main power was cut,\" Conn said. \"Don't do anything back there\r\ntill we give you the go-ahead.\"\r\n\r\nMatsui nodded and set off on foot along the broad aisle in the middle.\r\nConn looked around in the dim light that filtered through the dusty\r\nglass overhead. On either side of the central aisle were two\r\nproduction lines; between each pair, at intervals, stood massive\r\nmachines which evidently fabricated parts for the power cartridges.\r\nOver them, and over the machines directly involved in production,\r\nwere receptor aerials, all oriented toward a stubby tower, twenty\r\nfeet thick and fifty in height, topped by a hemispherical dome.\r\n\r\n\"That'll be the control tower for all the machinery in here,\" he\r\ndecided. \"Anse, suppose you and I go take a look at it.\"\r\n\r\n\"We'll take a look at the machines,\" Rivas said. \"Clyde, you and I can\r\nwork back on the right and then come down on the other side. You know\r\nanything about this stuff?\"\r\n\r\n\"Me? Nifflheim, no,\" Nichols said. \"I know a robo-control when I see\r\none, and I know whether it's set to receive or not.\"\r\n\r\nThere was a self-powered lift inside the control tower. Conn and Anse\r\nrode it to the top and got out, Anse snapping on his flashlight. It\r\nwas dark in the dome at the top; instead of windows there were\r\nviewscreens all around it. Five men had worked here; at least, there\r\nwere four chairs at four intricate control panels, one for each of the\r\nfour production lines, and a fifth chair in front of a number of\r\ncommunication screens. There was a heavy-duty power unit, turned off.\r\nConn threw the switch. Lights came on inside, and the outside\r\nviewscreens lit.\r\n\r\nThey were examining the control-panels when Conn's belt radio buzzed.\r\nHe plugged it in on his helmet. It was Mohammed Matsui.\r\n\r\n\"There's one big power plant back here,\" the engineer said. \"Right in\r\nthe middle. It only powers what's in front of it. There must be\r\nanother one in either wing, for the isotope plant and the\r\ncartridge-case plant. I'll go look at them. But the power's been cut\r\noff from the machines in the main building. There's four big switches,\r\none for each production line--\"\r\n\r\nHe was interrupted by a shout, almost a shriek, from somewhere. It\r\nsounded like Jerry Rivas. A moment later, Rivas was clamoring:\r\n\r\n\"Conn! What did you turn on? Turn it off, right away!\"\r\n\r\nAnse jumped to the switch, pulling it with one hand and getting on his\r\nflashlight with the other. The lights went out and the screens went\r\ndark.\r\n\r\n\"It's off.\"\r\n\r\n\"The dickens it is!\" Rivas disputed. \"There are a couple of big\r\nsupervisor-robots circling around, and a flock of workers....\"\r\n\r\nAt the same time, Clyde Nichols began cursing. Or maybe he was\r\npraying; it was hard to be certain.\r\n\r\n\"But we pulled the switch. It was only the lights and viewscreens in\r\nhere, anyhow.\"\r\n\r\n\"It didn't do any good. Pull another one.\"\r\n\r\nMatsui, back at the power plant, was wanting to know what was wrong.\r\nCaptain Nichols stopped cursing--or praying?--and said, \"Mutiny,\r\nthat's what! The robots have turned on us!\"\r\n\r\nHe knew what had happened, or was almost sure he did. A radio impulse\r\nhad gone out, somehow, from the control tower. Something they hadn't\r\nchecked, that had been left on. There was just enough current-leakage\r\nfrom the units in the robots to keep the receptors active for forty\r\nyears. The supervisor-robots had gone active, and they had activated\r\nthe rest. Once on, cutting the current from the control tower wouldn't\r\nturn them off again.\r\n\r\n\"Put the switch in again, Anse; the damage is done and you won't make\r\nit any worse.\"\r\n\r\nWhen the screens came on, he looked around from one to another. The\r\ntwo supervisors, big ovoid things like the small round ones they had\r\nused in repairing the power reactors the first day, were circling\r\naimlessly near the roof, one clockwise and the other counterclockwise,\r\ndodging obstructions and getting politely out of each other's way. At\r\nlower altitude, a dozen assorted worker-robots were moving about, and\r\nmore were emerging from cells at the end of the building. Sweepers,\r\nwith rotary brooms and rakes, crablike all-purpose handling robots, a\r\ncouple of vacuum-cleaning robots, each with a flexible funnel-tipped\r\nproboscis and a bulging dust-sack. One tiling, a sort of special job\r\ndesigned to get into otherwise inaccessible places, had a twenty-foot,\r\nmany-jointed, claw-tipped arm in front. It passed by and slightly over\r\nthe tower, saw Clyde Nichols, and swooped toward him. With a howl,\r\nNichols dived under one of the large machines between two production\r\nlines. A pistol went off a couple of times. That would be Jerry Rivas.\r\nNobody else bothered with a gun on Koshchei, but he carried one as\r\nsome people carry umbrellas, whether he expected to need it or not and\r\nbecause he would feel lost without it.\r\n\r\nThat he took in at one glance. Then he was looking at the control\r\npanels. The switches and buttons were all marked for machine-control\r\nin different steps of power-unit production. That was all for the big\r\nstuff, powered centrally. There weren't any controls for lifters or\r\nconveyers or other mobile equipment. Evidently they were handled out\r\nin the shop, from mobile control-vehicles. He did find, on the\r\ncommunication-screen panel, a lot of things that had been left on. He\r\nsnapped them off, one after another, snapping them on when a screen\r\nwent dark. There were fifteen or twenty robots, some rather large, in\r\nthe air or moving on the floor by now.\r\n\r\n\"We can't do anything here,\" he told Anse. \"These are the\r\nshop-cleaning robots. They were the last things used here when the\r\nplace closed down, and the two supervisors were probably controlled\r\nfrom a vehicle, and it's anybody's guess where that is now. When you\r\nthrew that switch, it sent out an impulse that activated them. They're\r\nrunning their instruction-tapes, and putting the others through all\r\ntheir tricks.\"\r\n\r\nThree more shots went off. Jerry Rivas was shouting: \"Hey, whattaya\r\nknow! I killed one of the buggers!\"\r\n\r\nThere were any number of ways in which a work-robot could be shot out\r\nof commission with a pistol. All of them would be by the purest of\r\npure luck. The next time we go into a place like this, Conn thought,\r\nwe take a couple of bazookas along.\r\n\r\n\"Turn everything off and let's go. See what we can do outside.\"\r\n\r\nAnse put on his flashlight and pulled the switch. They got into the\r\nlift and rode down, going outside. As soon as they emerged, they saw a\r\nrectangular object fifteen feet long settle over their aircar, let\r\ndown half a dozen clawed arms, and pick it up, flying away with it. It\r\nhad taped instructions to remove anything that didn't belong in the\r\naisleway; it probably asked the supervisor about the aircar, and the\r\nsupervisor didn't return an inhibitory signal, so it went ahead. Conn\r\nand Anse both shouted at it, knowing perfectly well that shouting was\r\nfutile. Then they were running for their lives with one of the\r\ncrablike all-purpose jobs after them. They dived under the slightly\r\nraised bed of a long belt-conveyer and crawled. Jerry Rivas fired\r\nanother shot, somewhere.\r\n\r\nThe robots themselves were having troubles. They had done all the work\r\nthey were supposed to do; now the supervisors were insisting that they\r\ndo it over again. Uncomplainingly, they swept and raked and\r\nvacuum-cleaned where they had vacuum-cleaned and raked and swept forty\r\nyears ago. The scrap-pickers, having picked all the scrap, were going\r\nover the same places and finding nothing, and then getting deflected\r\nand gathering a lot of things not definable as scrap, and then\r\ncircling around, darting away from one another in obedience to their\r\nradar-operated evasion-systems, and trying to get to the outside scrap\r\npile, and finding that the doors wouldn't open because the door\r\nopeners weren't turned on, and finally dumping what they were carrying\r\nwhen the supervisors gave them no instructions.\r\n\r\nOne of them seemed to have dumped something close to where Clyde\r\nNichols was hiding; if his language had been a little stronger, it\r\nwould have burned out Conn's radio. Their own immediate vicinity being\r\nfor the moment clear of flying robots, Conn and Anse rolled from under\r\nthe conveyer and legged it between the two production lines.\r\nImmediately, three of the crablike all-purpose handling-robots saw\r\nthem, if that was the word for it, and came dashing for them, followed\r\nby a thing that was mostly dump-lifter; it was banging its bin-lid up\r\nand down angrily. About fifty yards ahead, Jerry Rivas stepped from\r\nbehind a machine and fired; one of the handling-robots flashed green\r\nfrom underneath, went off contragravity, and came down with a crash.\r\nImmediately, like wolves on a wounded companion, the other two pounced\r\nupon it, dragging and pulling against each other. That was a hunk of\r\njunk; their orders were to remove it.\r\n\r\nThe mobile trash-bin went zooming up to the ceiling, reversed within\r\ntwenty feet of it and came circling back to the ground, to go zooming\r\nup again. It had gone crazy, literally. It had been getting too many\r\ncontradictory orders from its supervisor, and its circuits were\r\noverloaded and its relays jammed. Rats in mazes and human-type people\r\nin financial difficulties go psychotic in very much the same way.\r\n\r\nThe two surviving all-purpose robots were also headed for a padded\r\nrepair shop. They had come close enough to each other to activate\r\ntheir anticollision safeties. Immediately, they flew apart. Then their\r\norder to pick up that big piece of junk took over, and they started\r\nforward again, to be bounced apart as soon as they were within five\r\nfeet of one another. If left alone, their power units would run down\r\nin a year or so; until then, they would keep on trying.\r\n\r\nSoulless intelligences, indeed! Then it occurred to him that for the\r\npast however-long-it-had-been he hadn't heard from Mohammed Matsui. He\r\njiggled his radio.\r\n\r\n\"Ham, where are you? Are you still alive?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm back at the power plant,\" Matsui said exasperatedly. \"There's a\r\nbig thing circling around here; every time I stick my head out, he\r\nmakes a dive at me. I didn't know robots would attack people.\"\r\n\r\n\"They don't. He just thinks you're some more trash he's been told to\r\ngather up.\"\r\n\r\nMatsui was indignant. Conn laughed.\r\n\r\n\"On the level, Ham. He has photoelectric vision, and a picture of what\r\nthat aisle is supposed to look like. When you get out in it, he knows\r\nyou don't belong there and tries to grab you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hey, there's a lot of junk in here in a couple of baskets at the\r\nconverter. Say I chuck one out to him; what would he do?\"\r\n\r\n\"Grab it and take it away, like he's taped to do.\"\r\n\r\n\"Okay; wait a minute.\"\r\n\r\nThey couldn't see the archway to the power plant, or even the robot\r\nthat had Matsui penned up, but after a few minutes they saw it soaring\r\naway, clutching a big wire basket full of broken boxes and other\r\nrubbish. It headed for the mutually repelling swarm of robots around\r\nthe door that wouldn't open for them. Conn and Anse and Jerry ran\r\ntoward the rear, joined by Clyde Nichols, who popped up from behind a\r\npile of spools of electric wire. They made it just before the\r\ncoffin-shaped thing that had carried off the aircar came over to\r\ninvestigate.\r\n\r\n\"You want to be careful back there,\" Matsui told them, as they started\r\ntoward the temporary safety of the power plant. \"All the\r\nreactor-repair robots are there; don't get _them_ on the warpath\r\nnext.\"\r\n\r\nOf course! There were always repair-robots at a power plant, to go\r\ninto places no human could enter and live. Behind the collapsium\r\nshielding, they wouldn't have been activated.\r\n\r\n\"Let's have a look at them. What kind?\"\r\n\r\n\"Standard reactor-servicers; the same we used at the administration\r\ncenter.\"\r\n\r\nMatsui opened the door, and they went into the power plant. Conn and\r\nMatsui put on the service-power and activated the two supervisors;\r\nthey, in turn, activated their workers. It was tricky work getting\r\nthem all outside the collapsium-walled power-plant area; each worker\r\nhad to be passed through by the supervisor inside, under Matsui's\r\ncontrol. Because of the close quarters at which they worked inside the\r\nreactor and the converter, they weren't fitted with anticollision\r\nrepulsors, and, working under close human supervision, they all had\r\naudiovisual pickups. It took some time to get adequate screens set up\r\noutside the collapsium.\r\n\r\nFinally, they were ready. Their two supervisors went up to the\r\nceiling, one controlled by Conn and the other by Matsui. The larger,\r\negg-shaped shop-labor supervisors were still moving in irregular\r\norbits; those of the workers still able to receive commands were\r\ntrying to obey them, and the rest were jammed in a swarm at the other\r\nend.\r\n\r\nFirst one, and then the other of the labor-boss robots were captured.\r\nThey were by now at the end of what might, loosely, be called their\r\nwits. They weren't used to operating without orders, and had been\r\nsending out commands largely at random. Now they came to a stop, and\r\nthen began moving in tight, guided circles; one by one, the worker\r\nrobots still able to heed them were brought to ground and turned off.\r\nThat left the swarm at the door. The worker-robots under direct\r\ncontrol of the power-plant supervisors went after them, grappling them\r\nand hauling them down to where Anse and Jerry Rivas and Captain\r\nNichols could turn them off manually.\r\n\r\nThe aircar was a hopeless wreck, but its radio was still functioning.\r\nConn called Charley Gatworth, who called a gang under Gomez, working\r\nnot far away; they came with another car.\r\n\r\nIt took all the next day for a gang of six of them to get the place\r\nstraightened up. Neither Conn nor Gomez, who was a roboticist himself,\r\nwould trust any of the workers or the two supervisors; their\r\nexperiences out of control had rendered them unreliable. They took out\r\ntheir power units and left them to be torn down and repaired later.\r\nOther robots were brought in to replace them. When they were through,\r\nthe power-unit cartridge plant was ready for operation.\r\n\r\nJerry Rivas wanted to start production immediately.\r\n\r\n\"We'll have to go back to Poictesme pretty soon,\" he said. \"We don't\r\nwant to go back empty. Well, I know that no matter what we dug up, and\r\nwhat we could sell or couldn't sell, there's always a market for\r\npower-unit cartridges. Electric-light units, household-appliance\r\nunits, aircar and airboat units, any size at all. We run that plant at\r\nfull capacity for a few days and we can load the _Harriett Barne_\r\nfull, and I'll bet the whole cargo will be sold in a week after we get\r\nin.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXV\r\n\r\n\r\nThe _Harriet Barne_ settled comfortably at the dock, the\r\nbunting-swathed tugs lifting away from her. They had the outside sound\r\npickups turned as low as possible, and still the noise was deafening.\r\nThe spaceport was jammed, people on the ground and contragravity\r\nvehicles swarming above, with police cars vainly trying to keep them\r\nin order. All the bands in Storisende seemed to have been combined;\r\nthey were blaring the \"Planetary Hymn\";\r\n\r\n_Genji Gartner's body lies a-moldering in the tomb,\r\nBut his soul goes marching on!_\r\n\r\nWhen they opened the airlock, there was a hastily improvised\r\nceremonial barge, actually a farm-scow completely draped in red and\r\nwhite, the Planetary colors. They all stopped, briefly, as they came\r\nout, to enjoy the novelty of outdoor air which could actually be\r\nbreathed. Conn saw his father in the scow, and beside him Sylvie\r\nJacquemont, trying, almost successfully, to keep from jumping up and\r\ndown in excitement. Morgan Gatworth to meet his son, and Lester Dawes\r\nto meet his. Kurt Fawzi, Dolf Kellton, Colonel Zareff, Tom Brangwyn.\r\nHe didn't see his mother, or his sister. Flora he had hardly counted\r\non, but he was disappointed that his mother wasn't there to meet him.\r\n\r\nSylvie was embracing her father as he shook hands with his; then she\r\nthrew her arms around his neck.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Conn, I'm so happy! I was watching everything I could on-screen,\r\neverything you saw, and all the places you were, and everything you\r\nwere doing....\"\r\n\r\nThe scow--pardon, ceremonial barge--gave a slight lurch, throwing\r\nthem together. Over her shoulder, he saw his father and Yves\r\nJacquemont exchanging grins. Then they had to break it up while he\r\nshook hands with Fawzi and Judge Ledue and the others, and by the time\r\nthat was over, the barge was letting down in front of the stand at the\r\nend of the dock, and the band was still deafening Heaven with \"Genji\r\nGartner's Body,\" and they all started up the stairs to be greeted by\r\nPlanetary President Vyckhoven; he looked like an elderly bear who has\r\nbeen too well fed for too long in a zoo. And by Minister-General\r\nMurchison, who represented the Terran Federation on Poictesme. He was\r\nthin and balding, and he looked as though he had just mistaken the\r\nvinegar cruet for the wine decanter. Genji Gartner's soul stopped\r\nmarching on, but the speeches started, and that was worse. And after\r\nthe speeches, there was the parade, everybody riding in\r\ntransparent-bodied aircars, and the _Lester Dawes_ and the two ships\r\nof the new Planetary Air Navy and a swarm of gunboats in column five\r\nhundred feet above, all firing salutes.\r\n\r\nIn spite of what wasn't, but might just as well have been, a concerted\r\nconspiracy to keep them apart, he managed to get a few words privately\r\nwith Sylvie.\r\n\r\n\"My mother; she didn't get here. Is anything wrong?\"\r\n\r\n\"Is anything anything else? I've been in the middle of it ever since\r\nyou went away. Your mother's still moaning about all these companies\r\nyour father's promoting--he never used to do anything like that, and\r\nit's all too big, and it's going to end in a big smash. And then she\r\ngets onto Merlin. You know, she won't say Merlin, she always calls it,\r\n'that thing.'\"\r\n\r\n\"I've noticed that.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then she begins talking about all the horrible things that'll happen\r\nwhen it's found, and that sets Flora off. Flora says Merlin's a big\r\nfake, and you and your father are using it to rob thousands of widows\r\nand orphans of their life savings, and that sets your mother off\r\nagain. Self-sustaining cyclic reaction, like the Bethe solar-phoenix.\r\nAnd every time I try to pour a little oil on the troubled waters, I\r\nfind I've gotten it on the fire instead. And then, Flora had this\r\nfight with Wade Lucas, and of course, she blames you for that.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good heavens, why?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, she couldn't blame it on herself, could she? Oh, you mean why\r\nthe fight? Lucas is in business with your father now, and she can't\r\nconvince him that you and your father are a pair of quadruple-dyed\r\nvillains, I suppose. Anyhow, the engagement is _phttt_! Conn, is my\r\nfather going back to Koshchei?\"\r\n\r\n\"As soon as we can round up some people to help us on the ship.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then I'm going along. I've had it, Conn. I'm a combat-fatigue case.\"\r\n\r\n\"But, Sylvie; that isn't any place for a girl.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, poo! This is Sylvie. We're old war buddies. We soldiered together\r\non Barathrum; remember?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, you'd be the only girl, and....\"\r\n\r\n\"That's what you think. If you expect to get any kind of a gang\r\ntogether, at least a third of them will be girls. A lot of technicians\r\nare girls, and when work gets slack, they're always the first ones to\r\nget shoved out of jobs. I'll bet there are a thousand girl technicians\r\nout of work here--any line of work you want to name. I know what I'll\r\ndo; I'll make a telecast appearance. I still have some news value,\r\nfrom the Barathrum business. Want to bet that I won't be the working\r\ngirl's Joan of Arc by this time next week?\"\r\n\r\nThat cheered him. A girl can punch any kind of a button a man can, and\r\na lot of them knew what buttons to punch, and why. Say she could find\r\nfifty girls....\r\n\r\nHe had a slightly better chance to talk to his father before the\r\nbanquet at the Executive Palace that evening. They shared the same\r\nsuite at the Ritz-Gartner, and even welcoming committees seldom chase\r\ntheir victims from bedroom to bath.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I know all about it,\" Rodney Maxwell said bitterly. \"I was home,\r\na couple of weeks ago. Flora simply will not speak to me, and your\r\nmother begged me, in tears, to quit everything we're doing here. I\r\ntried to give her some idea of what would happen if I dropped this,\r\neven supposing I could; she wouldn't listen to me.\" He finished\r\nputting the studs in his shirt. \"You still think this is worth what\r\nit's costing us?\"\r\n\r\n\"You saw the views we sent back. There's work on Koshchei for a\r\nmillion people, at least. Why, even these two makeshift ships they're\r\nputting together here at Storisende are giving work, one way or\r\nanother, to almost a thousand. Think what things will be like a year\r\nfrom now, if this keeps on.\"\r\n\r\nRodney Maxwell gave a wry laugh. \"Didn't know I had a real Simon-pure\r\naltruist for a son.\"\r\n\r\n\"Pardner, when you call me that, smile.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am smiling. With some slight difficulty.\"\r\n\r\nHe didn't think well of the banquet. Back in Litchfield, Senta would\r\nhave fired half her human help and taken a sledgehammer to her\r\nrobo-chef for a meal like that. Even his father's camp cook would have\r\nbeen ashamed of it. And there were more speeches.\r\n\r\nPresident Vyckhoven managed to get hold of him and Yves Jacquemont\r\nafterward, and steered them into his private study.\r\n\r\n\"Have you any real reason for thinking that Merlin might be on\r\nKoshchei?\" the Planetary President asked.\r\n\r\n\"Great Ghu, no! We weren't looking for Merlin, Mr. President. We were\r\nlooking for a hypership. We have one, too. Calling her _Ouroboros II_.\r\nTwenty-five-hundred-footer. We expect to have her to space in a few\r\nmonths. I surely don't need to tell you what that will do toward\r\nrestoring planetary prosperity.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, of course not; a hypership of our own. But....\" He looked from\r\none to the other of them. \"But I understood.... That is, Mr. Kurt\r\nFawzi was saying....\"\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Fawzi is looking for Merlin here on Poictesme. If anybody finds\r\nit, that's where it'll be found. I'm interested in getting business\r\nstarted again. If Merlin is found, it would help, of course.\" He\r\nshrugged.\r\n\r\n\"Don't look at me,\" Jacquemont said. \"Mr. Maxwell--both of them,\r\nfather and son--want some spaceships. They hired me to help build\r\nthem. That's all I have in it.\" Then he relit the cigar the President\r\nhad given him and leaned back in his chair, staring at the stuffed\r\nalcesoid head with the seven-foot hornspread above the fireplace.\r\n\r\nConn described the interview to his father after they were back at the\r\nhotel.\r\n\r\n\"I hope you convinced him. You know, he's afraid of Merlin. A lot of\r\npeople have been saying that if Merlin's found, it should be used to\r\ndetermine Government policy. A few extremists are beginning to say\r\nthat Merlin ought to _be_ the Government, and Jake Vyckhoven and his\r\ncronies ought to be dumped. Into the handiest mass-energy converter,\r\npreferably. You know, if anybody found Merlin and started it auditing\r\nthe Planetary Treasury, Jake Vyckhoven'd be the one who'd be wanting a\r\nhypership.\"\r\n\r\nTom Brangwyn ran him down the next morning in the dining room.\r\n\r\n\"Conn, I wish you'd come along with me,\" he said. \"Some of us are up\r\nin Kurt's suite; we'd all like to talk to you.\"\r\n\r\nSomehow, he was acting as though he were making an arrest. That might\r\nhave been nothing but professional habit. Conn went up to Fawzi's\r\nsuite, and found Fawzi and Judge Ledue and Dolf Kellton and close to a\r\ndozen others there.\r\n\r\n\"I'm glad you could come, Conn,\" the Judge greeted him. Now that the\r\ndefendant had arrived, the trial could begin. \"I wish your father\r\ncould have gotten here. I asked him to come, but he had a prior\r\nengagement. A meeting with some of the financial people here, about\r\nsome company he's interested in.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's right; Trisystem & Interstellar Spacelines.\"\r\n\r\n\"Interstellar!\" Kurt Fawzi almost howled. \"Great Ghu! Now it isn't\r\nenough to go out to Koshchei; he wants to go clear out of the\r\nTrisystem. That's what we wanted to talk about; all this nonsense you\r\nand your father are in. Merlin's right here on Poictesme. It's right\r\nat Force Command, and if your father hadn't robbed us of all our best\r\nmen, like Jerry Rivas and Anse Dawes, we'd have found it by now. I\r\ndon't think you and your father care a hoot if we ever find Merlin or\r\nnot!\"\r\n\r\n\"Kurt, that's a dreadful thing to say,\" Dolf Kellton objected in a\r\nshocked voice.\r\n\r\n\"It's a dreadful thing to have to say,\" Fawzi replied, \"but you tell\r\nme what Conn Maxwell or Rodney Maxwell are doing to help find it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who showed you where Force Command was?\" Klem Zareff asked.\r\n\r\nNobody could think of any good quick comeback to that.\r\n\r\nConn took advantage of the pause to ask, \"Why do you want to find\r\nMerlin?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why do we ...\" Fawzi spluttered indignantly. \"If you don't know....\"\r\n\r\n\"I know why I do. I want to see if you do. Do you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Merlin would answer so many questions,\" Dolf Kellton told him gently.\r\n\"Questions I can't answer for myself.\"\r\n\r\n\"With Merlin, we could set up a legal code and a system of\r\njurisprudence that would give everybody absolute justice,\" Judge Ledue\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\nAs if absolute justice wasn't the last thing anybody in his right\r\nsenses would want; a robot-judge would have the whole planet in jail\r\ninside a month.\r\n\r\n\"We have a man who joined us after you went off to Koshchei, Conn,\"\r\nFranz Veltrin said. \"A Mr. Carl Leibert. He's some kind of a\r\nclergyman, from over Morven way. He says that Merlin could formulate\r\nan entirely new religion, which would regenerate humanity.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I don't have any such lofty ideas,\" Fawzi said. \"I just want\r\nMerlin to show us how to get some prosperity here; bring things back\r\nto what they were before Poictesme went broke.\"\r\n\r\n\"And that's what Father and I are trying to do. You're going into the\r\nwoods with a book on how to chop down a tree, and no ax.\" Fawzi looked\r\nat him in surprise, started to say something, and thought better of\r\nit. \"If we want prosperity, we need tools. Our problem is loss of\r\nmarkets. If we find Merlin, and tape it with everything that's\r\nhappened in the forty years since it was shut down, Merlin will tell\r\nus where to find new markets. But the markets won't come to us. We'll\r\nhave to do our own exporting, and we'll need ships. Now, you men have\r\nbeen studying about Merlin, and hunting for Merlin, all your lives. I\r\ncan't add anything to what you know, and neither can my father. You\r\nfind Merlin, and we'll have the ships ready when you do find it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Kurt, I think he has a point,\" somebody said.\r\n\r\n\"You're blasted well right he has,\" Klem Zareff put in. \"If it wasn't\r\nfor Conn Maxwell, you know where we'd be? Back in Litchfield, sitting\r\naround in Kurt's office, talking about how wonderful things'll be when\r\nwe find Merlin, and doing nothing to find it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Kurt, I believe Conn is entitled to an apology,\" Judge Ledue ruled.\r\n\"How close we are to finding Merlin I don't know, but it is due to him\r\nthat we have any hope of finding it at all.\"\r\n\r\n\"Conn, I'm sorry,\" Fawzi said. \"I oughtn't to have said some of the\r\nthings I did. But we're all on edge; we've been having so much\r\ntrouble.... Conn, it's right there at Force Command; I know it is.\r\nWe've been all over the place. We have shafts sunk at each of the\r\ncorners; we've used scanners, and put off echo shots. Nothing. We\r\nlooked for additional passages out of the headquarters; there aren't\r\nany. But it has to be somewhere around. It just _has_ to be!\"\r\n\r\n\"Maybe if I go out to Force Command with you, I might see something\r\nyou've overlooked. And if I can't, I'll try to scrape up some stuff on\r\nKoshchei for you. Deep-vein scanners, that sort of thing, from the\r\nmines.\"\r\n\r\nThey took the _Lester Dawes_ out at a little past noon and turned\r\nsouth and east. Everybody aboard was happy--except Conn Maxwell. He\r\nwas thinking of the years and years ahead of these trusting, hopeful\r\nold men, each year the grave of another expectation. Two hundred miles\r\nfrom Force Command, the _Goblin_ met them, her sides still spalled and\r\ndented from the hits she had taken in Barathrum Spaceport. When they\r\ncame in sight of it, the mesa-top was deserted. Fawzi began wondering\r\nwhere in Nifflheim all the drilling rigs, and the seismo-trucks, were.\r\nSomebody with a pair of binoculars called attention to activity on the\r\nside of the high butte on top of which the relay station was located.\r\nFawzi began swearing exasperatedly.\r\n\r\n\"Might be something Mr. Leibert thought of,\" Franz Veltrin suggested.\r\n\r\n\"Then why in blazes didn't he screen us about it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Who is this Leibert?\" Conn asked. \"Somebody mentioned him this\r\nmorning, I think.\"\r\n\r\n\"He joined us after you left, Conn,\" Dolf Kellton said. \"He's a\r\nclergyman from Morven. No regular denomination; he has a sect of his\r\nown.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yah, he would!\" Klem Zareff rumbled. \"Pious fraud!\"\r\n\r\n\"He's really a good man, Conn; Klem's prejudiced. He says we ought to\r\nuse Merlin to show us the true nature of God, and how to live in\r\naccordance with the Divine Will. He says Merlin can teach us a new\r\nreligion.\"\r\n\r\nA new religion, based on Merlin; that would be good. And then the\r\nfanatics who thought Merlin was the Devil would start a holy war to\r\nwipe out the servants of Satan, and with all the combat equipment that\r\nwas lying around on this planet.... For the first time since this\r\nbusiness started, he began to feel really frightened.\r\n\r\nAn aircar came bulleting away from the butte and landed on the mesa as\r\nthe _Lester Dawes_ set down. The man who met them at the head of the\r\nvertical shaft wore Federation fatigues--baggy trousers, ankle boots\r\nand long smock, dyed black. He was bareheaded, and his white hair was\r\nalmost shoulder-long. He had a white beard.\r\n\r\n\"Welcome, Brothers,\" he greeted, a hand raised in benediction. \"And\r\nwho is this with you?\"\r\n\r\nHis voice was high and quavery; not a good pulpit voice, Conn thought.\r\n\r\nKurt Fawzi introduced Conn, and Leibert grasped his hand with a grip\r\nthat was considerably stronger than his voice.\r\n\r\n\"Bless you, young man! It is to you alone that we owe our thanks that\r\nwe are about to find the Great Computer. Every sapient being in the\r\nGalaxy will honor your name for a thousand years.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I hadn't counted on quite that much, Mr. Leibert. If it'll only\r\nhelp a few of these people to make a decent living I'll be satisfied.\"\r\n\r\nLeibert shook his head sadly. \"You think entirely in material terms,\r\nyoung man,\" he reproved. \"Forget these things; acquire the higher\r\nspiritual values. The Great Computer must not be degraded to such\r\nuses; we should let it show us how to lift ourselves to a high\r\nspiritual plane....\"\r\n\r\nIt went on like that, after they went down to Foxx Travis's--now\r\nFawzi's--office, where there were silver-stoppered decanters instead\r\nof the old green-glass pitcher, and gold-plated ashtrays, and thick\r\ncarpets on the floor. The man was a lunatic; he made Fawzi's office\r\ngang look frigidly sane. Furthermore, he was an ignoramus. He had no\r\nidea what a computer could or couldn't do. Anybody who could build a\r\ncomputer of the sort he thought Merlin was wouldn't need it, he\r\n_would_ be God.\r\n\r\nAs he talked, Conn began to be nagged by an odd sense of recognition.\r\nHe'd seen this Carl Leibert before, somewhere, and somehow he was sure\r\nthat the long white hair and the untrimmed beard weren't part of the\r\npicture. That puzzled him. He doubted if he'd have remembered Leibert\r\nfrom six years ago, almost seven, now, though a lot of itinerant\r\nevangelists showed up in Litchfield. That might have been it.\r\n\r\n\"I tell you, the Great Computer is there, in the heart of the butte,\"\r\nLeibert was insisting, now. \"It has been revealed to me in a dream. It\r\nis completely buried. After it was made, no human touched it. The men\r\nwho were here and used it in the War communicated with it only by\r\nradio.\"\r\n\r\nThat could be so. There were fully robotic computers, intended for use\r\nin places where no human could go and live. There was a big one on\r\nNifflheim, armored against the fluorine atmosphere and the\r\nhydrofluoric-acid rains. But there was no point in that here, the\r\nthings were enormously complicated, and military engineering of any\r\nsort emphasized simplicity--_Aaaagh!_ Was he beginning to believe this\r\nbalderdash himself?\r\n\r\nKlem Zareff fell in with him as they were going to dinner. \"Revealed\r\nin a dream!\" the old Rebel snorted. \"One thing you can always get\r\naway with lying about is what you dream.\"\r\n\r\n\"You think he's lying? I think he's just crazy.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's what he wants you to think. Look, Conn, he knows Merlin is\r\nhere; he's trying to keep us from it. That's why he shifted all that\r\nequipment over on the butte. He's working for Sam Murchison.\"\r\n\r\n\"I thought your theory was that the Federation had lost Merlin.\"\r\n\r\n\"It was, at first. It doesn't look that way to me now. It's right here\r\nat Force Command, somewhere. They don't want it found, and they're\r\ngoing to do everything they can to stop us. I oughtn't to have left\r\nthis fellow Leibert here alone; well, I won't do that again. Get Tom\r\nBrangwyn to help me.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVI\r\n\r\n\r\nThe voyage back to Koshchei had been a week-long nightmare. When she\r\nhad been the pride and budget-wrecker of Transcontinent & Overseas\r\nAirline, the _Harriet Barne_ had accommodated two hundred first-class\r\nand five hundred lower-deck passengers, but the conversion to a\r\nspaceship had drastically reduced her capacity. The three hundred men\r\nand women who had been recruited for the Koshchei colony had been\r\ncrammed into her with brutal disregard for comfort, privacy or\r\nanything else except the ability of the air-recyclers to keep them\r\nbreathing. When Captain Nichols set her down at the administration\r\nbuilding at Port Carpenter, a few had had to be carried off, but they\r\nwere all alive, which made the trip an unqualified success.\r\n\r\nThe dozen leaders of the expedition were congratulating themselves on\r\nthat in one of the executive offices after the first dinner at Port\r\nCarpenter. Rodney Maxwell, in Storisende, had joined them in\r\nscreen-image; he was mostly listening, and sometimes contributing a\r\nremark apropos of something the rest of them had said five minutes\r\nago.\r\n\r\n\"Our hypership,\" Conn was saying, \"is going to have to be item\r\ntwo on the agenda. The first thing we need is a ship for the\r\nPoictesme-Koshchei run. By this time next year, we ought to have a\r\nthousand to fifteen hundred people here at the least. We can't haul\r\nthem all on that flying sardine can.\"\r\n\r\n\"We'll need supplies, too. What was left here won't last forever,\"\r\nNichols added.\r\n\r\n\"And you're going to have to run this at a profit,\" Luther Chen-Wong,\r\nwho had come along for first hand experience and to help with\r\nadministrative work, added. \"You have a big payroll to meet, and\r\nyou'll have to keep the stockholders happy. People like Jethro\r\nSastraman and some of these Storisende bankers aren't going to be\r\nsatisfied with promises and long-term prospects; they'll want\r\ndividends.\"\r\n\r\n\"We'll have to get claims staked on something besides Port Carpenter,\r\ntoo. Those ships that are building at Storisende will be finished\r\nbefore long,\" Jerry Rivas said. \"If we don't get some more things\r\nclaimed, the first thing you know, we'll own Port Carpenter and\r\nnothing else.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, let's see what we can find in the way of a big airboat, or a\r\nsmall ship,\" Conn said. \"Jerry, you can pick a party for exploring.\r\nJust zigzag around the planet and transmit in locations and views of\r\nwhatever you find, and we'll send it on to Storisende.\"\r\n\r\n\"And don't pick anybody for your exploring party that can't be spared\r\nfrom anything here,\" Jacquemont added. \"We don't want to have to chase\r\nyou halfway around the world to bring back the only specialist in\r\nsomething yesterday at the latest.\"\r\n\r\n\"Are you going to come along, Conn?\" Rivas asked.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Lord, no! I'm going to be doing fifteen things at once here.\"\r\n\r\nAll the computer work. Finding materials to make astrogational\r\nequipment and robo-pilots. Studying hyperspace theory--fortunately,\r\nthere was an excellent library here--and setting up classes, and\r\nteaching school. And keeping in touch with his father, on Poictesme.\r\nIt was making him nervous not to know what sort of foolishness the\r\nolder and wiser heads might be getting into.\r\n\r\nThe next morning, they began organizing work-gangs and setting up\r\ncommittees. Three men, two girls and about twenty robots got an\r\nopen-pit iron mine started; as soon as the steel mill was ready, ore\r\nstarted coming in. Anse Dawes had a gang looking for something they\r\ncould build a 350-foot interplanetary ship out of; Jacquemont and Mack\r\nVibart were getting plans and specifications and making lists of\r\nneeded materials. Conn gathered a dozen men and women and started\r\nclasses in computer theory and practice; at the same time, he and\r\nCharley Gatworth were teaching themselves and each other hyperspatial\r\nastrogation, which was the art of tossing a ship into some\r\neverythingless noplace outside normal space-time, and then pulling her\r\nout again by her bootstraps at some other place in the normal\r\ncontinuum, light-years away.\r\n\r\nRoughly, it compared to shooting hummingbirds on the wing,\r\nblindfolded, with a not particularly accurate pistol, from a\r\nmile-a-minute merry-go-round.\r\n\r\nThat was something you could only do with a computer. A human, with a\r\nslide rule, a pencil and pad, could figure it out, of course--if he\r\nhad fifty-odd thousand years to do it. A good computer did it in\r\nthirty seconds. That was one difference between people and computers.\r\nThe other difference was that the desirability of making a hyperspace\r\njump would never occur to a computer, unless somebody pushed a button\r\nand taped in instructions.\r\n\r\nThey found a three-hundred-foot globular skeleton, probably the\r\nnucleus of a big hyperspace ship, and decided that was big enough for\r\nwhat they wanted. The entire colony got to work on it. Photoprinted\r\nplans and specifications poured out as Jacquemont and a couple of\r\ndraftsmen got them up. Steel came out of the steel mill at one end\r\nwhile ore came in at the other. A swarm of big contragravity machines,\r\nsome robotic and some human-operated, clustered around the skeletal\r\nhull like hornets building a nest.\r\n\r\nTrisystem & Interstellar Spacelines was chartered; the lawyers\r\nreported having to overcome a little more resistance than usual from\r\nthe Government about that. And the bill to nationalize Merlin, which\r\nhad died in committee, was resuscitated and was being debated hotly on\r\nthe floor of Parliament. The Administration was now supporting it.\r\n\r\n\"Are they completely crazy?\" Conn wanted to know, when he heard about\r\nthat. \"They pass that bill and nobody's going to look for Merlin if\r\nthey know the Government will snatch it as soon as they find it.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is precisely Jake Vyckhoven's idea,\" his father replied. \"I told\r\nyou he was afraid of Merlin. He's getting more afraid of it every\r\nday.\"\r\n\r\nHe had reason to. There was a growing sentiment in favor of turning\r\nthe entire Government over to the computer as soon as it was found. To\r\nhis horror, Conn heard himself named as chairman of a committee that\r\nshould be set up to operate it. The moderates, who had merely wanted\r\nMerlin used in an advisory capacity, were dropping out; the agitation\r\nwas coming from extremists who wanted Merlin to be the whole\r\nGovernment, and now the extremists were developing an extreme wing of\r\ntheir own, who called themselves Cybernarchists and started wearing\r\ncolored-shirt uniforms and greeting each other with an archaic\r\nstiff-arm salute, and the words, \"Hail Merlin!\"\r\n\r\nAnd the followers of the gospel-shouter on the west coast were now\r\ncropping up all over the mainland, and on the continent of Acaire to\r\nthe north, and another cult, non-religious, was convinced that Merlin\r\nwas a living machine, with conscious intelligence of its own and\r\nawesome psi-powers, a sort of super-Golem, which, if found and\r\nawakened, would enslave the whole Galaxy. Fortunately, these two hated\r\neach other as venomously as both did the Cybernarchists, and spent\r\nmost of their energies attacking each other's meetings. The\r\nnews-services were beginning to publish casualty lists, some heavy\r\nenough for outpost fighting between a couple of regular armies.\r\n\r\nOne thing, it helped the employment situation. Everybody was hiring\r\nmercenaries.\r\n\r\n\"But what,\" Conn asked, \"are the sane people doing?\"\r\n\r\n\"You ought to know,\" his father told him. \"I suspect that you have all\r\nof them on Koshchei now.\"\r\n\r\nThe sane people, if that was what they were, were being busy. They\r\nwere putting a set of Abbott lift-and-drive engines together, and\r\nConn's computer class was estimating the mass of the finished ship and\r\nthe amount of energy needed to overcome gravitation and give it\r\nconstant acceleration from Koshchei to Poictesme. They were learning,\r\nby trial and error, largely error, how to build a set of pseudograv\r\nengines. And they were putting together a hundred and one other\r\nthings, all of which was good training for the time they'd be ready to\r\nstart work on _Ouroboros II_.\r\n\r\nJerry Rivas had found a contragravity craft which seemed to have been\r\nused by some top official for business and inspection trips, had\r\ngathered a crew of non-specialists who weren't urgently needed at Port\r\nCarpenter, and set out to circumnavigate the planet. It worked just\r\nthe reverse of expectation. He found a big uranium mine, with an\r\nisotope-separation plant and a battery of plutonium-breeders; that\r\nmeant that Mohammed Matsui and half a dozen other nuclear-power people\r\nhad to get into another boat and speed after him to see what he had\r\nreally found. As soon as they landed, Rivas took off again to discover\r\na copper mine and a complex of smelters and processing plants. That\r\ntook a few more experts, or reasonable facsimiles, away from Port\r\nCarpenter. And then he found a whole city that manufactured nothing\r\nbut computers and robo-controls and things like that.\r\n\r\nConn loaded his whole computer-theory class onto a freight-scow and\r\ntook them there. By the time he landed, his father was screening him\r\nfrom Storisende.\r\n\r\n\"When are you going to get the ship finished?\" he was asking. \"Kurt\r\nFawzi's pestering the daylights out of me. He wants that equipment you\r\npromised him.\"\r\n\r\n\"We're working on it. What's happened, has Carl Leibert had another\r\nrevelation?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know about that. Kurt's sure Merlin is directly under Force\r\nCommand. And speaking about Leibert, Klem Zareff's been after me about\r\nhim. You know I've contracted for the full-time and exclusive services\r\nof this Barton-Massarra detective agency. Well, Klem wants me to put\r\nthem to work investigating Leibert.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I know; Leibert's a Terran Federation spy. Why do you need the\r\nfull-time services of the biggest private detective agency on\r\nPoictesme?\"\r\n\r\n\"There have been some odd things happening. People have been trying to\r\nbribe and intimidate some of my office help. I have found microphones\r\nand screen-pickups planted around. I caught one of our clerks trying\r\nto make copies of voice-tapes. I think it's some of these other\r\nMerlin-chasing companies, trying to find out how close we are to it.\r\nKlem Zareff is recruiting more guards. But how soon are you going to\r\nget that ship built?\"\r\n\r\n\"We're working on it. That's all I know, now.\"\r\n\r\nHe went back to work getting a classroom ready for his students. If\r\nhe'd accepted that instructorship at Montevideo, he wouldn't be a full\r\nprofessor now, but none of the rest of this would be happening,\r\neither.\r\n\r\nThat night, he had the dream about starting the big machine and not\r\nbeing able to stop it again.\r\n\r\nThere was street-fighting in Storisende between the Cybernarchists and\r\nGovernment troops. There was a pitched battle in the west between the\r\nArmageddonists (Merlin-is-Satan) and the Human Supremacy League\r\n(Merlin-is-the-Golem), with heavy losses and claims of victory on both\r\nsides. President Vyckhoven proclaimed planet-wide martial law, and\r\nthen discovered that he had nothing to enforce it with.\r\n\r\nLuther Chen-Wong screened him from Port Carpenter. His voice was\r\nalmost inaudibly low at first.\r\n\r\n\"Conn, I just had a call from Jerry and Clyde. I think we can knock\r\noff work on that ship we're building now. We won't need it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Have they found a ship?\" If they had, it would be the first one\r\nanybody had found. \"Where?\"\r\n\r\n\"They haven't found _a_ ship, Conn; they've found all of them. All the\r\nships in the Alpha System except the _Harriet Barne_ and the two\r\nthey're building at Storisende. The place is marked on the map as\r\nSickle Mountain Naval Observatory. It's just a bitty little dot, but\r\nthe map was made before the evacuation started. It's where most of the\r\ntroops in the system were embarked on hyperships, I think. Wait till I\r\nshow you the views.\"\r\n\r\nConn put on another screen; the first view was from an altitude of\r\nfive miles. He didn't need Luther's voice to identify Sickle Mountain;\r\na long curve, with a spur at right angles to one end, the name must\r\nhave suggested itself to whoever saw it first. The observatory had\r\nbeen built where the handle of the sickle joined the blade; as the\r\nship from which the view had been taken had approached, the details\r\ngrew plainer. At the same time, it became evident that the plain\r\ninside the curve of the sickle was powdered with tiny sparkles, like\r\ntinsel dust on red-brown velvet.\r\n\r\n\"Great Ghu, are those all ships?\"\r\n\r\n\"That's right. Look at this one, now.\"\r\n\r\nThe view changed. The aircraft was down, now, below the crest of the\r\nmountain, circling slowly above the plain. Hundreds, no, over a\r\nthousand, of them; two- and three-and five-hundred-footers, and here\r\nand there a thousand-footer that could have been converted into a\r\nhypership if anybody had wanted to take the trouble. The view changed\r\nagain; this time from an aircar dropped from the ship, he supposed; it\r\nwas down almost to the tops of the ships, and he could read names and\r\nhome ports: _Pixie_, Chloris; _Helen O'Loy_, Anaitis. They were from\r\nJurgen. _Sky-Rover_, Port Saunders; she was from Horvendile. Ships\r\nfrom Storisende, and Yellowmarsh on Janicot, and....\r\n\r\n\"Now we know where they all went.\"\r\n\r\nIt was logical, of course. Most of the hyperships used in the\r\nevacuation had been built here. It had been less trouble to lead the\r\ntroops and the civilian workers from Poictesme and the other planets\r\nonto small normal-space ships and bring them here than to take the big\r\nships away on short interplanetary runs to the other planets.\r\n\r\n\"Have you screened my father yet?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. This is going to knock the bottom out of the companies that are\r\nbuilding those ships at Storisende, I'm afraid.\"\r\n\r\n\"Their tough luck.\"\r\n\r\n\"It could be everybody's tough luck. Both those companies have been\r\nissuing stock, and there's been a lot of speculation in it. This\r\nmarket's so inflated now that a puncture at one place might blow the\r\nwhole thing out.\"\r\n\r\nHe knew that. He shrugged. \"Father will have to think of something.\r\nTell him I'll screen him from Sickle Mountain.\"\r\n\r\nThen he went back to his classroom.\r\n\r\n\"All right, class dismissed,\" he said. \"You have twenty minutes to get\r\nyour bags packed. We're going to work for real, now.\"\r\n\r\nAirboats and airships flocked to Sickle Mountain; some of them\r\nhastened back to Port Carpenter for loads of food, for there was none\r\nin the storehouses at the embarkation camp. They inspected ship after\r\nship, and chose two three-hundred-footers. They sent airships and\r\nfreight-scows to the dozen-odd cities and industrial centers that had\r\nbeen already explored, to gather cargo, as far as possible the items\r\nin shortest supply on Poictesme.\r\n\r\n\"Don't worry about a market smash,\" his father told him. \"We have that\r\ntaken care of. Trisystem Investments has just bought up a lot of stock\r\nin both of those companies, and we've set up agreements with\r\nthem--informally, of course; we'll have to get them voted on by our\r\nown companies--to sell them ships from Koshchei. In return, the\r\ncompany that's building the ship out of four air-freighters will go to\r\nJanicot, and the company that's building a ship out of the old\r\nLeitzenring Building will go to Jurgen, and they'll both stay off\r\nKoshchei. Sterber, Flynn & Chen-Wong will probably be defending\r\nantitrust suits till the end of time. The Planetary Government has\r\nstopped liking us, you know.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then we'll have to get one that will like us. There'll be an election\r\nabout this time next year, won't there?\"\r\n\r\nHis father nodded. \"To use one of your expressions, we're working on\r\nit. How soon can you get your ships in?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well be loaded and ready to lift off in a week. Another week for the\r\ntrip.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, don't forget that equipment you promised Kurt Fawzi.\"\r\n\r\n\"We'll have that on. Jerry Rivas is gathering it up now.\"\r\n\r\n\"How are you fixed for arms on Koshchei?\"\r\n\r\n\"Arms? Why, there are some. There was a pretty big force of Space\r\nMarines on duty here, and they left everything they couldn't carry in\r\ntheir hands. Why? The Armageddonists and the Cybernarchists and Human\r\nSupremacy bought all you had on hand?\"\r\n\r\n\"They're buying, but I wasn't thinking of that. I was thinking that\r\nyour crews might need something to argue their way off the ships at\r\nStorisende with. Things are getting just slightly rugged here, now.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVII\r\n\r\n\r\nThere were no bands or speeches when they came in this time. A lot of\r\ncontragravity vehicles circled widely around the spaceport, but except\r\nfor a few news-service cars, the police were keeping them back of a\r\ntwo-mile radius around the landing-pits. A couple of gunboats were\r\nmaking tight circles above, and on the dock were more vehicles and a\r\nhorde of police and guards.\r\n\r\nWhen Rodney Maxwell came across the bridge from the dock after they\r\nopened the airlocks, he was followed by a dozen Barton-Massarra\r\nprivate police, as villainous-looking a collection of ruffians as Conn\r\nhad ever seen. He was wearing a new suit, with a waist-length jacket\r\ninstead of the long coat he usually wore, and there was a holstered\r\nautomatic on each hip. In Litchfield, he never carried more than one\r\npistol, and Storisende was supposed to be an orderly place where\r\nnobody needed to go armed. More than anything else, that told Conn\r\napproximately what had been going on while he had been on Koshchei.\r\n\r\n\"Ship-guard,\" his father told Yves Jacquemont. \"All your crew can come\r\noff; they'll take care of things. Get your people in that troop\r\ncarrier over there. Everybody will stay at Interplanetary Building.\r\nNone of the hotels are safe, not even the Ritz-Gartner. And be sure\r\neverybody's well armed when they come off the ship.\"\r\n\r\nJacquemont nodded. \"I know the drill; I've been in Port Oberth on\r\nVenus and Skorvann on Loki. Any law we want, we make for ourselves.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's about it. I'll see you there. Conn, I wish you'd come with me.\r\nSomebody here wants to talk to you.\"\r\n\r\nHe wondered if his mother, or Flora, had come to Storisende. When he\r\nasked his father as they crossed onto the dock, there was a brief\r\ntwinge of pain in Rodney Maxwell's face.\r\n\r\n\"No, they're not having anything to do--_Duck; quick!_\"\r\n\r\nThen his father was diving under a lifter-truck that stood empty on\r\nthe dock. The private police were scattering for cover, and an\r\nauto-cannon began pom-pomming. Conn took one quick look in the\r\ndirection in which it was firing, saw an aircar that had broken\r\nthrough the police line and was rushing toward them, and dived under\r\nthe lifter after his father. As he did, he saw a missile flash out\r\nfrom one of the gunboats like a thrown knife. Then he huddled beside\r\nhis father and put his arms over his head.\r\n\r\nHe felt the heat and shock of the explosion and, an instant later,\r\nheard the roar. When nothing immediately disastrous happened after he\r\nhad counted fifteen seconds, he stuck his head out and looked up. The\r\ngunboat was struggling to regain her equilibrium, and the aircar had\r\nvanished in a fireball. They both emerged, straightening. His father\r\nwas brushing himself with his hands and saying something about always\r\nhaving to duck under something when he had a new suit on.\r\n\r\n\"Robot control, probably; could have been launched from anywhere in\r\ntown. Why, no; your mother and Flora aren't speaking to either of us,\r\nany more. Pity, of course, but I'm glad they're in Litchfield. It's a\r\nlittle healthier there.\"\r\n\r\nThey walked to the slim recon-car and climbed in, pulling the door\r\nshut after them. Wade Lucas was waiting for them at the controls.\r\n\r\n\"There, you see!\" he began, as soon as he had the car lifting. \"What\r\nI've been telling you. We'll have to stop this.\"\r\n\r\n\"Conn, meet our new partner. I told him everything you told me, out on\r\nthe Mall, the day you came home. I had to,\" his father hastened to\r\nadd. \"He'd figured most of it out for himself. The only thing to do\r\nwas admit him to the lodge and give him the oath.\"\r\n\r\n\"I didn't know about General Travis; I didn't even know he was still\r\nalive,\" Lucas said. \"But the rest of it was pretty obvious, once I\r\nstopped jumping to conclusions and did a little thinking. You know,\r\never since I came here I've been preaching to these people to stop\r\nlooking for Merlin and do something to help themselves. You're smarter\r\nthan I am, Conn; instead of opposing them, you're guiding them.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did you tell Flora?\"\r\n\r\nLucas shook his head. \"I tried to explain what you're trying to do,\r\nbut she wouldn't listen. She just told me I'd gotten to be as big a\r\ncrook as you two.\" He had the car up to fifty thousand; putting it\r\ninto a wide circle around the city, he locked the controls and got out\r\nhis cigarettes. \"Rod, we've got to stop this. You were just lucky this\r\ntime. Some of these days your luck's going to run out.\"\r\n\r\n\"How can we stop?\" Conn demanded. \"Tell them the truth? They'd lynch\r\nus, and then go on hunting for Merlin.\"\r\n\r\n\"Worse than that; it'd be a smash worse than the one when the War\r\nended. I was only ten then, but I can remember that very plainly. We\r\ncan't stop it, and we wouldn't dare stop it if we could.\"\r\n\r\n\"What's been going on here in the last month?\" Conn asked. \"I've been\r\ntoo busy to keep in touch. I know there's been rioting, and these\r\ncrackpot sects, but....\"\r\n\r\n\"I think this is personal to us. There have been some ugly things\r\nhappening. There were four attempts to burglarize our offices. I told\r\nyou about some of the other stuff, the microphones we found, and so\r\non. The worst thing was Lucy Nocero, my secretary. She just vanished,\r\na couple of weeks ago. Three days later, the police found her\r\nwandering in a park, a complete imbecile. Somebody who either didn't\r\nknow how to use one or didn't care what happened had used a mind-probe\r\non her. It's twenty to one she'll never recover.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's this Storisende financial crowd,\" Wade Lucas said. \"They had\r\nthings all their own way till Alpha-Interplanetary was organized. Now\r\nthey're getting shoved into the background, and they don't like it.\"\r\n\r\n\"They're making more money than they ever did, and they just love it,\"\r\nRodney Maxwell said. \"I'd think it was either Jake Vyckhoven or Sam\r\nMurchison.\"\r\n\r\n\"Murchison!\" Lucas hooted. \"Why, he's nobody! Federation\r\nMinister-General; all the authority of the Terran Federation, and\r\nnothing to enforce it with. He doesn't have a position, here; he has a\r\ndisease. Sleeping sickness.\"\r\n\r\n\"He certainly doesn't believe there is a Merlin, does he?\" Conn asked.\r\n\r\n\"I don't know what he believes, but he's getting to be Klem Zareff's\r\nopposite number. He thinks this whole thing's a plot against the\r\nFederation. It's a good thing Klem didn't get around to repainting his\r\ncombat vehicles black and green, the way he did the Home Guard stuff\r\nat Litchfield.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'd be more likely to think it was Vyckhoven.\"\r\n\r\n\"Could be. Or it could be the Armageddonists, or Human Supremacy; I am\r\nashamed to say that this heil-Merlin Cybernarchist gang are friendly\r\nto us. Or it could be some of the banking crowd, or some of these\r\nrival space-companies. Barton-Massarra is trying to find out. Well, we\r\nhave some of Wade's pet suspects at Interplanetary Building now.\r\nThere's been a meeting going for the last week to partition the Alpha\r\nGartner System.\"\r\n\r\nThe Interplanetary Building had been a medium-class residence hotel at\r\nthe time of the War. Junior staff officers and civilian technicians\r\nand their families had lived there. It had been vacant ever since the\r\ndisastrous outbreak of peace. Now it had a big new fluorolite sign,\r\nand housed the offices of all the Maxwell companies. There was a\r\ntruculent display of anti-vehicle weapons on the top landing stage,\r\nand more Barton-Massarra private police. They looked even more\r\nvillainous then the ones at the spaceport. Conn recalled having heard\r\nthat most of the Blackie Perales gang had been discharged for lack of\r\nevidence; he wondered how many of them had hired with Barton-Massarra.\r\n\r\nThe meeting was in a big conference room six floors down; it had been\r\ngoing on uninterrupted for days, with all the interested companies'\r\nrepresentatives standing watch-and-watch around the clock. Lester\r\nDawes and Morgan Gatworth and Lorenzo Menardes were there for L. E. &\r\nS.; Transcontinent & Overseas was represented; there were people from\r\nAlpha-Interplanetary, and bankers and financiers, and people from the\r\ncompanies building the two ships at the spaceport. And J. Fitzwilliam\r\nSterber, the lawyer.\r\n\r\nAnd reporters, phoning stories in and getting audiovisual interviews\r\nof anybody who would hold still long enough. They converged in a rush\r\nas Conn and his father and Lucas came in.\r\n\r\n\"No statement, gentlemen!\" Rodney Maxwell shouted, above the babble of\r\ntheir questions. \"When we have anything to release, it will be\r\nreleased to all of you.\"\r\n\r\nJacquemont and Nichols had already arrived; Lucas went to them and\r\nbegan talking about stevedores and lifters to get off the cargoes from\r\nthe ships. Conn hastened to join them.\r\n\r\n\"The scanning and mining equipment aboard the _Helen O'Loy_,\" he said.\r\n\"That shouldn't be unloaded here; we'll take the ship out to Force\r\nCommand and unload it there.\"\r\n\r\nOut of the corner of his eye, he saw, a lurking reporter snatch the\r\nhandphone off his radio and begin talking; it would be stated\r\nauthoritatively that Merlin was at Force Command and would be\r\nuncovered as soon as special equipment from Koshchei arrived.\r\n\r\nEverybody at the long table was shouting at everybody else. The Jurgen\r\nand Janicot Companies wanted to buy ships from Koshchei Exploitation &\r\nDevelopment. The Alpha-Interplanetary director, who was also a\r\nvice-president of Transcontinent & Overseas, opposed that; another\r\ndirector of A-I, who was also board chairman of Koshchei Exploitation\r\n& Development, wanted to sell ships to anybody who had the price, the\r\nTranscontinent & Overseas man was calling him a traitor to the\r\ncompany, and one of the stockbrokers, who was also a vice-president of\r\nTrisystem Investments and a director of Trisystem & Interstellar\r\nSpacelines, was wanting to know which company. And a banker who was\r\nstockholder in all the companies was shouting that they were all a\r\ngang of crooks, and J. Fitzwilliam Sterber was declaring that anybody\r\nwho called him a crook could continue the discussion through seconds.\r\n\r\nConn suddenly realized that dueling had never been illegal on\r\nPoictesme. He wondered how many duels this meeting was going to hatch.\r\n\r\nThe next afternoon the _Helen O'Loy_ was unloaded, all but the mining\r\nequipment; Conn and Yves Jacquemont and Charley Gatworth and a few\r\nothers took her out to Force Command. They were met by Klem Zareff's\r\narmed airboats two hundred and fifty miles from the mesa, and they\r\nfound the place in more of a state of siege than when the Badlands had\r\nbeen full of outlaws. A lot of heavy armament seemed to have been\r\nmoved in from Barathrum Spaceport, and Zareff had more men and\r\nfirepower than he had ever commanded during the System States War. If\r\nMinister-General Murchison was convinced that the Merlin excitement\r\nwas a cover for some seditious plot against the Federation, this ought\r\nto give him food for thought.\r\n\r\nThere was still work, mostly boring lateral shafts for echo shots,\r\ngoing on at the butte, under the relay station. That was Leibert, who\r\nwas still insisting that that was where Merlin was buried. There was\r\nalso some work on top of the mesa, by those who were convinced that\r\nthat was where Merlin was to be found. Kurt Fawzi was taking the lead\r\nin that. Franz Veltrin and Dolf Kellton sided with Leibert, and\r\nFawzi's office clique had split into two factions. Judge Ledue was\r\nmaintaining strict impartiality, as befitted his judicial position.\r\n\r\n\"Why hasn't your father gotten those detectives of his to work on this\r\nfake preacher?\" Zareff wanted to know, when he and Tom Brangwyn were\r\nable to talk to Conn alone.\r\n\r\n\"Well, they've been busy,\" Conn said. \"Trying to keep him alive, for\r\none thing. You heard about the robo-bomb somebody launched at us the\r\nday we brought the ships in, didn't you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, and we heard about the Nocero girl, too,\" Brangwyn said. \"But\r\nhasn't it ever occurred to you or your dad that this fellow that calls\r\nhimself Leibert might be mixed up with the gang that did that?\"\r\n\r\n\"You suspect him, too?\"\r\n\r\nBrangwyn nodded. \"I took a few audiovisuals of him, when he didn't\r\nknow it; I sent them to some different law-enforcement people over in\r\nMorven, where he says he comes from. They never saw him before, and\r\ncouldn't find anybody who did.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well? He just doesn't have a police record, then.\"\r\n\r\n\"He says he's a preacher. Preachers don't go off in the woods by\r\nthemselves to preach; they get up in pulpits, in front of a lot of\r\npeople. Those towns over in Morven are small enough for everybody to\r\nhave known something about him. He's a fake, I tell you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let me have copies of those audiovisuals, Tom. I'll see what can be\r\nfound out about him. I'm beginning to wonder about him myself. I'm\r\nsure I've seen him, somewhere....\"\r\n\r\nWhen he got back to Storisende, he found that the marathon conference\r\non the sixth floor down at the Interplanetary Building had finally\r\ncome to an end. Everybody seemed satisfied, and apparently nobody was\r\ngoing to have pistols and coffee with anybody else about it.\r\n\r\n\"We have things fixed up,\" his father told him. \"The gang who are\r\nbuilding the ship out of four air-freighters are chartered as Janicot\r\nIndustries, Ltd.; they're going to specialize in chemical products.\r\nThe other company has a charter now, too. They're going to operate on\r\nJurgen and Horvendile. We'll sell them ships, and Alpha-Interplanetary\r\nwill put on scheduled trips to all three planets and also Koshchei.\r\nWe're getting along very nicely with them, except that everybody's\r\ncompeting for technicians and skilled labor. We have two hundred more\r\npeople signed up for Koshchei. What you want to do is train as many of\r\nthem as you can for ship-operation. Alpha-Interplanetary is going to\r\nstart a training program here at Storisende; you'd better leave one of\r\nyour ships for them to work on, and send back as many ships as you can\r\nfind officers and crews for.\"\r\n\r\n\"We're getting things really started.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. The only trouble is....\" His father frowned. \"I don't understand\r\nthese people, Conn. Everybody ought to be making millions out of this\r\nby this time next year, but all any of them, even these Storisende\r\nbankers, can talk about is how soon we're going to find Merlin.\"\r\n\r\n\"I wish we could stop that, somehow. Listen; I have it. Merlin never\r\nwas on Poictesme; Merlin was a space-station a few thousand miles\r\noff-planet; there was a crew of operators aboard, and they\r\ncommunicated with Force Command by radio. When the War ended, they\r\ntook it outside the system and shot off a planetbuster inside her. No\r\nmore Merlin. How would that be?\"\r\n\r\nHis father shook his head. \"Wouldn't do. If anybody believed it, which\r\nI doubt, they'd just quit. The market would collapse, everybody would\r\nbe broke, it would just be the end of the War all over again. Conn, we\r\ncan't let it stop now. We're going too fast to stop; if we tried it,\r\nwe'd smash up and break our necks.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVIII\r\n\r\n\r\nJerry Rivas, Mack Vibart and Luther Chen-Wong had been keeping things\r\nrunning on Koshchei. Work on the interplanetary ship at Port\r\nCarpenter had stopped when the Sickle Mountain ships had been found;\r\nit had never been resumed. When Conn returned, he found work started\r\non the _Ouroboros II_. Some of the two hundred newcomers who came in\r\non the _Helen O'Loy_ had special skills needed on the hypership; most\r\nof them went with Clyde Nichols and Charley Gatworth to Sickle\r\nMountain to train as normal-space officers and crewmen. Some of them,\r\nit was hoped, would later qualify for hyperspace work. Sylvie, who had\r\nbeen one of the star pupils in the computer class, was now helping him\r\nwith the long lists of needed materials, some of which had to be\r\nbrought from other places as much as a thousand miles away. Jerry\r\nRivas went back to exploring; Nichols had to drop his space-training\r\nwork temporarily to organize a fleet of air-freighters; usually, the\r\nmen best able to operate them were urgently needed on some job at the\r\nconstruction dock.\r\n\r\nShips lifted out almost daily from Sickle Mountain. They tried to get\r\nsome kind of salable cargo for each one, without depriving themselves\r\nof what they needed for themselves. Some of the ships came back loaded\r\nwith provisions and bringing new recruits--for instance, the teaching\r\nof physics and mathematics almost stopped at Storisende College\r\nbecause the professors had been virtually shanghaied.\r\n\r\nConn found himself losing touch with affairs on Poictesme. Ships had\r\nlanded on both Janicot and Horvendile and were sending back claims to\r\nabandoned factories. By that time they had all the decks into the\r\n_Ouroboros II_, and he was working aboard, getting the astrogational\r\nand hyperspace instruments put in place. The hypership _Andromeda_ was\r\nback from the Gamma System; there was close secrecy about what the\r\nexpedition had found, but the newscasts were full of conjectures about\r\nMerlin, and the market went into another dizzy upward spiral.\r\nLitchfield Exploration & Salvage opened a huge munitions depot, and\r\ncombat equipment, once almost unsalable, was selling as fast as it\r\ncame out. The Government was buying some, but by no means all of it.\r\n\r\n\"Conn, can you come back here to Poictesme for a while?\" his father\r\nasked. \"Things have turned serious. I don't like to talk about it by\r\nscreen--too many people know our scrambler combinations. But I wish\r\nyou were here.\"\r\n\r\nHe started to object; there were millions, well, a couple of hundred,\r\nthings he had to attend to. The look on his father's face stopped him.\r\n\r\n\"Ship leaving Sickle Mountain tomorrow morning,\" he said. \"I'll be\r\naboard.\"\r\n\r\nThe voyage back to Poictesme was a needed rest. He felt refreshed when\r\nhe got off at Storisende Spaceport and was met by his father and Wade\r\nLucas in one of the slim recon-cars. They greeted him briefly and took\r\nthe car up and away from the city, where it was safe to talk.\r\n\r\n\"Conn, I'm scared,\" his father said. \"I'm beginning to think there\r\nreally is a Merlin, after all.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, come off it! I know it's contagious, but I thought you'd been\r\nvaccinated.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm beginning to think so, too,\" Lucas said. \"I don't like it at\r\nall.\"\r\n\r\n\"You know what that gang who took the _Andromeda_ to Panurge found?\"\r\n\r\n\"They were looking for the plant that fabricated the elements for\r\nMerlin, weren't they?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. They found it. My Barton-Massarra operatives got to some of the\r\ncrew. This place had been turning out material for a computer of\r\nabsolutely unconventional design; the two computermen they had with\r\nthem couldn't make head or tail of half of it. And every blueprint,\r\nevery diagram, every scrap of writing or recording, had been\r\ndestroyed. But they found one thing, a big empty fiber folder that had\r\nfallen under something and been overlooked. It was marked: TOP\r\nSECRET. PROJECT MERLIN.\"\r\n\r\n\"Project Merlin could have been anything,\" Conn started to say. No.\r\nProject Merlin was something they made computer parts for.\r\n\r\n\"Dolf Kellton's research crew, at the Library here, came across some\r\nreferences to Project Merlin, too. For instance, there was a routine\r\ndivision court-martial, a couple of second lieutenants, on a very\r\ntrivial charge. Force Command ordered the court-martial stopped, and\r\nthe two officers simply dropped out of the Third Force records, it was\r\nstated that they were engaged in work connected with Project Merlin.\r\nThat's an example; there were half a dozen things like that.\"\r\n\r\n\"Tell him what Kurt Fawzi and his crew found,\" Wade Lucas said.\r\n\r\n\"Yes. They have a fifty-foot shaft down from the top of the mesa\r\nalmost to the top of the underground headquarters. They found\r\nsomething on top of the headquarters; a disc-shaped mass, fifty feet\r\nthick and a hundred across, armored in collapsium. It's directly over\r\nwhat used to be Foxx Travis's office.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's not a tenth big enough for anything that could even resemble\r\nMerlin.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, it's something. I was out there day before yesterday. They're\r\ndown to the collapsium on top of this thing; I rode down the shaft in\r\na jeep and looked at it. Look, Conn, we don't know what this Project\r\nMerlin was; all this lore about Merlin that's grown up since the War\r\nis pure supposition.\"\r\n\r\n\"But Foxx Travis told me, categorically, that there was no Merlin\r\nProject,\" Conn said. \"The War's been over forty years; it's not a\r\nmilitary secret any longer. Why would he lie to me?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why did you lie to Kurt Fawzi and the others and tell them there was\r\na Merlin? You lied because telling the truth would hurt them. Maybe\r\nTravis had the same reason for lying to you. Maybe Merlin's too\r\ndangerous for anybody to be allowed to find.\"\r\n\r\n\"Great Ghu, are you beginning to think Merlin is the Devil, or\r\nFrankenstein's Monster?\"\r\n\r\n\"It might be something just as bad. Maybe worse. I don't think a man\r\nlike Foxx Travis would lie if he didn't have some overriding moral\r\nobligation to.\"\r\n\r\n\"And we know who's been making most of the trouble for us, too,\" Lucas\r\nadded.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" Rodney Maxwell said, \"we do. And sometime I'm going to invite\r\nKlem Zareff to kick my pants-seat. Sam Murchison, the Terran\r\nFederation Minister-General.\"\r\n\r\n\"How'd you get that?\"\r\n\r\n\"Barton-Massarra got some of it; they have an operative planted in\r\nMurchison's office. And some of our banking friends got the rest. This\r\nHuman Supremacy League is being financed by somebody. Every so often,\r\ntheir treasurer makes a big deposit at one of the banks here, all\r\nFederation currency, big denomination notes. When I asked them to,\r\nthey started keeping a record of the serial numbers and checking\r\nwithdrawals. The money was paid out, at the First Planetary Bank, to\r\nMr. Samuel S. Murchison, in person. The Armegeddonists are getting\r\nmoney, too, but they're too foxy to put theirs through the banks. I\r\nbelieve they're the ones who mind-probed Lucy Nocero. Barton-Massarra\r\nbelieve, but they can't prove, that Human Supremacy launched that\r\nrobo-bomb at us, that time at the spaceport.\"\r\n\r\n\"Have you done anything with those audiovisuals of Leibert?\"\r\n\r\n\"Gave them to Barton-Massarra. They haven't gotten anything, yet.\"\r\n\r\n\"So we have to admit that Klem wasn't crazy after all. What do you\r\nwant me to do?\"\r\n\r\n\"Go out to Force Command and take charge. We have to assume that there\r\nmay be a Merlin, we have to assume that it may be dangerous, and we\r\nhave to assume that Kurt Fawzi and his covey of Merlinolators are just\r\nbefore digging it up. Your job is to see that whatever it is doesn't\r\nget loose.\"\r\n\r\nThe trouble was, if he started giving orders around Force Command he'd\r\nstop being a brilliant young man and become a half-baked kid, and one\r\nword from him and the older and wiser heads would do just what they\r\npleased. He wondered if the pro-Leibert and anti-Leibert factions were\r\nstill squabbling; maybe if he went out of his way to antagonize one\r\nside, he'd make allies of the other. He took the precaution of\r\nscreening in, first; Kurt Fawzi, with whom he talked, was almost\r\nincoherent with excitement. At least, he was reasonably sure that none\r\nof Klem Zareff's trigger-happy mercenaries would shoot him down coming\r\nin.\r\n\r\nThe well, fifty feet in diameter, went straight down from the top of\r\nthe mesa; as the headquarters had been buried under loose rubble,\r\nthey'd had to vitrify the sides going down. He let down into the hole\r\nin a jeep, and stood on the collapsium roof of whatever it was they\r\nhad found. It wasn't the top of the headquarters itself; the microray\r\nscannings showed that. It was a drum-shaped superstructure, a sort of\r\nunderground penthouse. And there they were stopped. You didn't cut\r\ncollapsium with a cold chisel, or even an atomic torch. He began to\r\nsee how he was going to be able to take charge here.\r\n\r\n\"You haven't found any passage leading into it?\" he asked, when they\r\nwere gathered in Fawzi's--formerly Foxx Travis's--office.\r\n\r\n\"Nifflheim, no! If we had, we'd be inside now.\" Tom Brangwyn swore.\r\n\"And we've been all over the ceiling in here, and we can't find\r\nanything but vitrified rock and then the collapsium shielding.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sure. There are collapsium-cutters, at Port Carpenter, on Koshchei.\r\nThey do it with cosmic rays.\"\r\n\r\n\"But collapsium will stop cosmic rays,\" Zareff objected.\r\n\r\n\"Stop them from penetrating, yes. A collapsium-cutter doesn't\r\npenetrate; it abrades. Throws out a rotary beam and works like a\r\ngrinding-wheel, or a buzz-saw.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, could you get one down that hole?\" Judge Ledue asked.\r\n\r\nHe laughed. \"No. The thing is rather too large. In the first place,\r\nthere's a full-sized power-reactor, and a mass-energy converter. With\r\nthem, you produce negamatter--atoms with negatively charged protons\r\nand positive electrons, positrons. Then, you have to bring them into\r\ncontact with normal positive-matte--That's done in a chamber the size\r\nof a fifty-gallon barrel, made of collapsium and weighing about a\r\nhundred tons. Then you have to have a pseudograv field to impart\r\nrotary motion to your cosmic-ray beam, and the generator door that\r\nwould lift ten ships the size of the _Lester Dawes_. Then you need\r\nanother fifty to a hundred tons of collapsium to shield your\r\ncutting-head. The cutting-head alone weighs three tons. The rotary\r\nbeam that does the cutting,\" he mentioned as an afterthought, \"is\r\nabout the size of a silver five-centisol piece.\"\r\n\r\nNobody said anything for a few seconds. Carl Leibert stated that\r\nDivine Power would aid them. Nobody paid much attention; Leibert's\r\nstock seemed to have gone bearish since he had found nothing in the\r\nbutte and Fawzi had found that whatever-it-was on top of Force\r\nCommand.\r\n\r\n\"Means we're going to dig the whole blasted top off, clear down to\r\nwhere that thing is,\" Zareff said. \"That'll take a year.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, no. Maybe a couple of weeks, after we get started,\" Conn told\r\nthem. \"It'll take longer to get the stuff loaded on a ship and hauled\r\nhere than it will to get that thing uncovered and opened.\"\r\n\r\nHe told them about the machines they used in the iron mines on\r\nKoshchei, and as he talked, he stopped worrying about how he was going\r\nto take charge here. He had just been unanimously elected\r\nIndispensable Man.\r\n\r\n\"Bless you, young man!\" Carl Leibert cried. \"At last, the Great\r\nComputer! Those who come after will reckon this the Year Zero of the\r\nAge of Regeneration. I will go to my chamber and return thanks in\r\nprayer.\"\r\n\r\n\"He's been doing a lot of praying lately,\" Tom Brangwyn remarked,\r\nafter Leibert had gone out. \"He's moved into the chaplain's quarters,\r\nback of the pandenominational chapel on the fourth level down. Always\r\nkeeps his door locked, too.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, if he wants privacy for his devotions, that's his business.\r\nMaybe we could all do with a little prayer,\" Veltrin said.\r\n\r\n\"Probably praying to Sam Murchison by radio,\" Klem Zareff retorted.\r\n\"I'd like to see inside those rooms of his.\"\r\n\r\nHe called Yves Jacquemont at Port Carpenter after dinner. When he told\r\nJacquemont what he wanted and why, the engineer remarked that it was a\r\npity screens couldn't be fitted with olfactory sensors, so that he\r\ncould smell Conn's breath.\r\n\r\n\"I am not drunk. I am not crazy. And I am not exercising my sense of\r\nhumor. I don't know what Fawzi and his gang have here, but if it isn't\r\nMerlin it's something just as hot. We want at it, soonest, and we'll\r\nhave to dig a couple of hundred feet of rock off it and open a\r\ncollapsium can.\"\r\n\r\n\"How are we going to get that stuff on a ship?\"\r\n\r\n\"Anything been done to that normal-space job we started since I saw it\r\nlast? Can you find engines for it? And is there anything about those\r\nmining machines or the cutter that would be damaged by space-radiation\r\nor re-entry heat?\"\r\n\r\nYves Jacquemont was silent for a good deal longer than the\r\ninterplanetary time-lag warranted. Finally he nodded.\r\n\r\n\"I get it, Conn. We won't put the things in a ship; we'll build a ship\r\naround them. No; that stuff can all be hauled open to space. They use\r\nthings like that at space stations and on asteroids and all sorts of\r\nplaces. We'll have to stop work on _Ouroboros_, though.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let _Ouroboros_ wait. We are going to dig up Merlin, and then\r\neverybody is going to be rich and happy, and live happily forever\r\nafter.\"\r\n\r\nJacquemont looked at him, silent again for longer than the usual five\r\nand a half minutes.\r\n\r\n\"You almost said that with a straight face.\" After all, Jacquemont\r\nhadn't been cleared yet for the Awful Truth About Merlin, but, like\r\nhis daughter, he'd been doing some guessing. \"I wish I knew how much\r\nof this Merlin stuff you believe.\"\r\n\r\n\"So do I, Yves. Maybe after we get this thing open, I'll know.\"\r\n\r\nTo give himself a margin of safety, Jacquemont had estimated the\r\narrival of the equipment at three weeks. A week later, he was\r\non-screen to report that the skeleton ship--they had christened her\r\n_The Thing_, and when Conn saw screen views of her he understood\r\nwhy--was finished and the collapsium-cutter and two big mining\r\nmachines were aboard. Evidently nobody on Koshchei had done a stroke\r\nof work on anything else.\r\n\r\n\"Sylvie's coming along with her; so are Jerry Rivas and Anse Dawes and\r\nHam Matsui and Gomez and Karanja and four or five others. They'll be\r\nready to go to work as soon as she lands and unloads,\" Jacquemont\r\nadded.\r\n\r\nThat was good; they were all his own people, unconnected with any of\r\nthe Merlin-hunting factions at Force Command. In case trouble started,\r\nhe could rely on them.\r\n\r\n\"Well, dig out some shootin'-irons for them,\" he advised. \"They may\r\nneed them here.\"\r\n\r\nDepending, of course, on what they found when they opened that\r\ncollapsium can on top of Force Command, and how the people there\r\nreacted to it.\r\n\r\n_The Thing_ took a hundred and seventy hours to make the trip;\r\nconditions in the small shielded living quarters and control cabin\r\nwere apparently worse than on the _Harriet Barne_ on her second trip\r\nto Koschchei. Everybody at Force Command was anxious and excited. Carl\r\nLeibert kept to his quarters most of the time, as though he had to\r\npray the ship across space.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, reports of the near completion of _Ouroboros II_\r\nwere monopolizing the newscasts, to distract public attention from\r\nwhat was happening at Force Command. Cargo was being collected for\r\nher; instead of washing their feet in brandy, next year people would\r\nbe drinking water. Lorenzo Menardes had emptied his warehouses of\r\neverything over a year old; so had most of the other distillers up and\r\ndown the Gordon Valley. Melon and tobacco planters were talking about\r\nbreaking new ground and increasing their cultivated acreage for the\r\nnext year. Agricultural machinery was in demand and bringing high\r\nprices. So were stills, and tobacco-factory machinery. It began to\r\nlook as though the Maxwell Plan was really getting started.\r\n\r\nIt was decided to send the hypership to Baldur on her first voyage;\r\nthat was Wade Lucas's suggestion. He was going with her himself, to\r\nrecruit scientific and technical graduates from his alma mater, the\r\nUniversity of Paris-on-Baldur, and from the other schools there. Conn\r\nwas enthusiastic about that, remembering the so-called engineers on\r\nKoshchei, running around with a monkey-wrench in one hand and a\r\ntextbook in the other, trying to find out what they were supposed to\r\ndo while they were doing it. Poictesme had been living for too long on\r\nthe leavings of wartime production; too few people had bothered\r\nlearning how to produce anything.\r\n\r\n_The Thing_ finally settled onto the mesa-top. It looked like\r\nsomething from an old picture of the construction work on one of the\r\nTerran space-stations in the First Century. Immediately, every piece\r\nof contragravity equipment in the place converged on her; men dangled\r\non safety lines hundreds of feet above the ground, cutting away beams\r\nand braces with torches. The two giant mining machines, one after the\r\nother, floated free on their own contragravity and settled into place.\r\n_The Thing_ lifted, still carrying the collapsium-cutting equipment,\r\nand came to rest on the brush-grown flat beyond, out of the way.\r\n\r\nIf Yves Jacquemont had overestimated the time required to get the\r\nequipment loaded and lifted off from Koshchei, Conn had been\r\noveroptimistic about the speed with which the top of the mesa could be\r\nstripped off. Digging away the rubble with which the pit had been\r\nfilled, and even the solid rock around it, was easier than getting the\r\nstuff out of the way. Farm-scows came in from all over, as fast as\r\nthey and pilots for them could be found; the rush to get brandy and\r\ntobacco to Storisende had caused an acute shortage of vehicles.\r\n\r\nOne by one, the members of the old Fawzi's Office gang came drifting\r\nin--Lorenzo Menardes, Morgan Gatworth, Lester Dawes. None of them had\r\nany skills to contribute, but they brought plenty of enthusiasm.\r\nRodney Maxwell came whizzing out from Storisende now and then to watch\r\nthe progress of the work. Of all the crowd, he and Conn watched the\r\ntwo steel giants strip away the tableland with apprehension instead of\r\nhope. No, there was a third. Carl Leibert had stopped secluding\r\nhimself in his quarters; he still talked rapturously about the\r\nmiracles Merlin would work, but now and then Conn saw him when he\r\nthought he was unobserved. His face was the face of a condemned man.\r\n\r\nThe _Ouroboros II_ was finished. The whole planet saw, by\r\nscreen, the ship lift out; watched from the ship the dwindling away\r\nof Koshchei and saw Poictesme grow ahead of her. Twelve hours before\r\nshe landed, work at Force Command stopped. Everybody was going to\r\nStorisende--Sylvie, whose father would command her on her voyage to\r\nBaldur, Morgan Gatworth, whose son would be first officer and\r\nastrogator, everybody. Except Carl Leibert.\r\n\r\n\"Then I'm not going either,\" Klem Zareff decided. \"Somebody's got to\r\nstay here and keep an eye on that snake.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, nor me,\" Tom Brangwyn said. \"And if he starts praying again, I'm\r\ngoing to go and pray along with him.\"\r\n\r\nConn stayed, too, and so did Jerry Rivas and Anse Dawes. They watched\r\nthe newscast of the lift-out, a week later. It was peaceful and\r\nharmonious; everybody, regardless of their attitudes on Merlin, seemed\r\nagreed that this was the beginning of a new prosperity for the planet.\r\nThere were speeches. The bands played \"Genji Gartner's Body,\" and the\r\n\"Spaceman's Hymn.\"\r\n\r\nAnd, at the last, when the officers and crew were going aboard, Conn\r\nsaw his sister Flora clinging to Wade Lucas's arm. She was one of the\r\nsmall party who went aboard for a final farewell. When she came off,\r\nalong with Sylvie, she was wiping her eyes, and Sylvie was comforting\r\nher. Seeing that made Conn feel better even than watching the ship\r\nitself lift away from Storisende.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIX\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Sylvie returned from Storisende, she had Flora with her. Conn's\r\nsister greeted him embarrassedly; Sylvie led both of them out of the\r\ncrowd and over to the edge of the excavation.\r\n\r\n\"Go ahead, Flora,\" she urged. \"Make up with Conn. It won't be any\r\nharder than making up with Wade was.\"\r\n\r\n\"How did that happen, by the way?\" Conn asked.\r\n\r\n\"Your girlfriend,\" Flora said. \"She came to the house and practically\r\nforced me into a car and flew me into Storisende, and then made me\r\nkeep quiet and listen while Wade told me the truth.\"\r\n\r\n\"I wasn't completely sure what the truth was myself till Wade opened\r\nup,\" Sylvie admitted. \"I had a pretty good idea, though.\"\r\n\r\n\"I always hated that Merlin thing,\" Flora burst out. \"All those old\r\nmen in Fawzi's office, dreaming about the wonderful things Merlin was\r\ngoing to do, with everything crumbling around them and everybody\r\ngetting poorer every year, and doing nothing, nothing! And when you\r\nwere coming home, I was expecting you to tell them there was no Merlin\r\nand to go to work and do something for themselves. But you didn't, and\r\nI couldn't see what you were trying to do. And then when Wade joined\r\nyou and Father, I thought he was either helping you put over some kind\r\nof a swindle or else he'd started believing in Merlin himself. I\r\nshould have seen what you were trying to do from the beginning. At\r\nleast, from when you talked them into cleaning the town up and fixing\r\nthe escalators and getting the fountains going again.\"\r\n\r\nSo the fountains weren't dusty any more.\r\n\r\n\"How's Mother taking things now?\"\r\n\r\nFlora looked distressed. \"She goes around wringing her hands.\r\nHonestly. I never saw anybody doing that outside a soap opera. Half\r\nthe time she thinks you and Father are a pair of unprincipled\r\nscoundrels, and the other half she thinks you're going to let Merlin\r\ndestroy the world.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm beginning to be afraid of something like that myself.\"\r\n\r\n\"Huh? But Merlin's just a big fake, isn't it? You're using it to make\r\nthese people do something they wouldn't do for themselves, aren't\r\nyou?\"\r\n\r\n\"It started that way. What do you think all this is about?\" he asked,\r\ngesturing toward the excavation and the two giant mining machines\r\ndigging and blasting and pounding away at the rock.\r\n\r\n\"Well, to keep Kurt Fawzi and that crowd happy, I suppose. It seems\r\nlike an awful waste of time, though.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm afraid it isn't. I'm afraid Merlin, or something just as bad, is\r\ndown there. That's why I'm here, instead of on Koshchei. I want to\r\nkeep people like Fawzi from doing anything foolish with it when they\r\nfind it.\"\r\n\r\n\"But there _can't_ be a Merlin!\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm afraid there is. Not the sort of a Merlin Fawzi expects to find;\r\nthat thing's too small for that. But there's something down there....\"\r\n\r\nThe question of size bothered him. That drum-shaped superstructure\r\ncouldn't even hold the personnel-record machine they had found here,\r\nor the computers at the Storisende Stock Exchange. It could have been\r\nan intelligence-evaluator, or an enemy-intentions predictor, but it\r\nseemed small even for that. It would be something _like_ a computer;\r\nthat was as far as he was able to go. And it could be something\r\ncompletely outside the reach of his imagination.\r\n\r\nAt the back of his mind, the suspicion grew that Carl Leibert knew\r\nexactly what it was. And he became more and more convinced that he had\r\nseen the self-styled preacher before.\r\n\r\nFinally, the whole top of the hundred-foot collapsium-covered\r\nstructure was uncovered, and the excavation had been leveled out wide\r\nenough to accommodate all the massive paraphernalia of the\r\ncollapsium-cutter. They put _The Thing_ onto contragravity again, and\r\nbrought her down in place; the work of lifting off the reactor and the\r\nconverter and the rest of it, piece by piece, began. Finally,\r\neverything was set up.\r\n\r\nA dozen and a half of them were gathered in the room that had become\r\ntheir meeting-place, after dinner. They were all too tired to start\r\nthe cutting that night, and at the same time excited and anxious. They\r\ntalked in disconnected snatches, and then somebody put on one of the\r\ntelecast screens. A music program was just ending; there was a brief\r\nsilence, and then a commentator appeared, identifying his\r\nnews-service. He spoke rapidly and breathlessly, his professional\r\ngravity cracking all over.\r\n\r\n\"The hypership _City of Asgard_, from Aton, has just come into\r\ntelecast range,\" he began. \"We have received an exclusive Interworld\r\nNews Service story, recently brought to Aton on the Pan-Federation\r\nSpacelines ship _Magellanic_, from Terra.\r\n\r\n\"News of revived interest in the Third Force computer, Merlin, having\r\nreached Terra by way of Odin, representatives of Interworld News, to\r\nwhich this service subscribes, interviewed retired Force-General Foxx\r\nTravis, now living, at the advanced age of a hundred and fourteen, on\r\nLuna. General Travis, who commanded the Third Fleet-Army Force here\r\nduring the War, categorically denied that there had ever existed any\r\nsuper-computer of the sort.\r\n\r\n\"We bring you, now, a recorded interview with General Travis, made on\r\nLuna....\"\r\n\r\nFor an instant, Conn felt the room around him whirling dizzily, and\r\nthen he caught hold of himself. Everybody else was shouting in sudden\r\nconsternation, and then everybody was hushing everybody else and\r\nmaking twice as much noise. The screen flickered; the commentator\r\nvanished, and instead, seated in the deep-cushioned chair, was the\r\nthin and frail old man with whom Conn had talked two years before, and\r\nthrough an open segment of the dome-roof behind him the full Earth\r\nshone, the continents of the Western Hemisphere plainly\r\ndistinguishable. A young woman in starchy nurse's white bent forward\r\nsolicitously from beside the chair, handing him a small beaker from\r\nwhich he sipped some stimulant. He looked much as he had when Conn had\r\ntalked to him. But there was something missing....\r\n\r\nOh, yes. The comparative youngster of seventy-some--\"Mike Shanlee ...\r\nmy _aide-de-camp_ on Poictesme ... now he thinks he's my keeper....\"\r\nHe wasn't in evidence, and he should be. Then Conn knew where and when\r\nhe had seen the man who claimed to be a preacher named Carl Leibert.\r\n\r\n\"There is absolutely no truth in it, gentlemen,\" Travis was saying.\r\n\"There never was any such computer. I only wish there had been; it\r\nwould have shortened the War by years. We did, of course, use\r\ncomputers of all sorts, but they were all the conventional types used\r\nby business organizations....\"\r\n\r\nThe rest was lost in a new outburst of shouting: General Travis, in\r\nthe screen, continued in dumb-show. The only thing Conn could\r\ndistinguish was Leibert's--Shanlee's--voice, screaming: \"Can it be a\r\nlie? Is there no Great Computer?\" Then Kurt Fawzi was pounding on the\r\ntop of the desk and bellowing, \"Shut up! Listen!\"\r\n\r\n\"Frankly, I'm surprised,\" Travis was continuing. \"Young Maxwell talked\r\nto me, here in this room, a couple of years ago; I told him then that\r\nnothing of the sort existed. If he's back on Poictesme telling people\r\nthere is, he's lying to them and taking advantage of their credulity.\r\nThere never was anything called Project Merlin....\"\r\n\r\n\"Hah, who's a liar now?\" Klem Zareff shouted. \"Dolf, what did your\r\npeople find in the Library?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, that's right!\" Professor Kellton exclaimed. \"My students did\r\nfind a dozen references to Project Merlin. He couldn't be ignorant of\r\nanything like that.\"\r\n\r\n\"This youth has been lying to us all along!\" the old man with the\r\nbeard cried, pointing an accusing finger at Conn. \"He has created\r\nfalse hopes; he has given us faith in a delusion. Why, he is the\r\nwickedest monster in human history!\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, thank you, General Travis,\" another voice, from the\r\nscreen-speaker, was saying. The only calm voice in the room. \"That was\r\na most excellent statement, sir. It should....\"\r\n\r\n\"Conn, you didn't tell us you'd talked to General Travis,\" Morgan\r\nGatworth was saying. \"Why didn't you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because I never believed anything he told me. You were in Kurt\r\nFawzi's office the day I came home; you know how shocked everybody was\r\nwhen I told you I hadn't been able to learn anything positive. Why\r\nshould I repeat his lies and discourage everybody that much more? Why,\r\nhe'd deny there was a Merlin if he was sitting on top of it,\" Conn\r\ndeclared. \"He wants the credit for winning the War, not for letting\r\nMerlin win it for him.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't blame Conn,\" Klem Zareff said. \"If he'd told us that then,\r\nsome of us might have believed it.\"\r\n\r\n\"And look what we found,\" Kurt Fawzi added, pointing at the ceiling.\r\n\"Is that Merlin up there, or isn't it?\"\r\n\r\n\"That little thing!\" Shanlee cried scornfully. \"How could that be\r\nMerlin? I am going to my chamber, to pray for forgiveness for this\r\nwretch.\"\r\n\r\nHe turned and started for the door.\r\n\r\n\"Stop him, Tom!\" Conn said, and Tom Brangwyn put himself in front of\r\nthe older man, gripping his right arm. Shanlee tried, briefly, to\r\nresist.\r\n\r\n\"Seems to me you lost faith in Merlin awfully quick,\" the former town\r\nmarshal of Litchfield said. \"You knew there was a Merlin all along,\r\nand you never wanted us to find it.\"\r\n\r\nFranz Veltrin, who had been \"Leibert's\" most enthusiastic adherent,\r\nhad also lost faith suddenly; he was shouting vituperation at the\r\nProphet of Merlin.\r\n\r\n\"Knock it off, Franz; he was only doing his duty,\" Conn said. \"Weren't\r\nyou, General Shanlee?\"\r\n\r\nIt took almost a minute before they stopped yelling for an explanation\r\nand allowed him to make one. He caught Klem Zareff's comment: \"Must be\r\npretty hot, if they have to send a general to handle it.\"\r\n\r\n\"I talked to Travis, yes. He gave me the same story he just repeated\r\non that interview,\" Conn said, picking his way carefully between fact\r\nand fiction. \"After I went back to Montevideo, he and this aide of his\r\nmust have been afraid I didn't believe it, which I didn't. When I was\r\nready to graduate, I got this offer of an instructorship; that was a\r\nbribe to keep me on Terra and off Poictesme. When I turned it down and\r\ntook the _Mizar_ home, Travis sent Shanlee after me. He must have\r\ngrown that beard and that pageboy bob on the way out. I suppose he\r\ncontacted Murchison as soon as he landed. Wait a minute.\"\r\n\r\nHe went to the communication screen and punched out a combination. A\r\ngirl appeared and singsonged: \"Barton-Massarra, Investigation and\r\nProtection.\"\r\n\r\n\"Conn Maxwell here. We gave you some audiovisuals of a man with a\r\nwhite beard, alias Carl Leibert,\" he began.\r\n\r\n\"Just a sec, Mr. Maxwell.\" She spoke quickly into a handphone. The\r\nscreen flickered, and she was replaced by a hard-faced young man in\r\ndark clothes.\r\n\r\n\"Hello, Mr. Maxwell; Joe Massarra. We haven't anything on Leibert\r\nyet.\"\r\n\r\n\"Are any of the officers of the _Andromeda_ where you can contact\r\nthem? Let them see those audiovisual. I'll bet that beard was grown\r\naboard ship coming out from Terra.\"\r\n\r\nBedlam broke out suddenly. Shanlee, who had been standing passively,\r\nhis right arm loosely grasped by Tom Brangwyn, came down on Brangwyn's\r\ninstep with the heel of his left foot and hit Brangwyn under the chin\r\nwith the heel of his left palm. Wrenching his arm free, he started for\r\nthe door. Sylvie Jacquemont snatched a chair and threw it along the\r\nfloor; it hit the fleeing man's ankles and brought him down. Half a\r\ndozen men piled on top of him, and Brangwyn was yelling to them not to\r\nchoke him to death till he could answer some questions.\r\n\r\n\"Hey, what's going on?\" the detective-agency man in the screen was\r\nasking. \"Need help? We'll start a car right away.\"\r\n\r\n\"Everything's under control, thank you.\"\r\n\r\nMassarra hesitated for a moment. \"What's the dope on this statement\r\nthat was on telecast a few minutes ago?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"Travis doesn't want us to find Merlin. What you just heard was one of\r\nhis people, planted here at Force Command. We're going to question him\r\nwhen we have time. But there isn't a word of truth in that statement\r\nyou just heard on the _Herald-Guardian_ newscast. Merlin exists, and\r\nwe've found it. We'll have it opened inside of thirty hours at most.\"\r\n\r\nThat was the line he was going to take with everybody. As soon as he\r\nhad Massarra off the screen, he was punching the combination of his\r\nfather's private screen at Interplanetary Building. It took five\r\ninterminable minutes before Rodney Maxwell came on. He could hear Klem\r\nZareff shouting orders into one of the inside communication\r\nscreens--general turnout, everything on combat-ready; guards to come\r\nat once to the office.\r\n\r\n\"How close are you to digging that thing out?\" his father asked as\r\nsoon as he appeared.\r\n\r\n\"We're down to it; we can start cutting the collapsium any time now.\"\r\n\r\n\"Start cutting it ten minutes ago,\" his father told him. \"And don't\r\nleave Force Command till you have it open. How many men and vehicles\r\ndoes Klem have for defense? You'll need all of them in a couple of\r\nhours. Everybody here is stunned, now; they'll come out of it inside\r\nan hour, and they'll come out fighting.\"\r\n\r\n\"You'd better come out here.\" He turned, saw Jerry Rivas helping hold\r\nShanlee in a chair, and shouted to him: \"Jerry! Turn out the workmen.\r\nStart cutting the can open right away.\" He turned back to his father.\r\n\"Klem's just ordered all his force out. Are you coming here?\"\r\n\r\n\"I can't. In about an hour, everything's going up with a bang. I have\r\nto be here to grab a few of the pieces.\"\r\n\r\n\"You'll do a lot of good in jail, or on the end of a rope.\"\r\n\r\n\"Chance I have to take,\" his father replied. \"I think I'll have a\r\ncouple of hours. If anybody from the press calls you, what are you\r\ngoing to tell them?\"\r\n\r\nConn repeated the line he had taken already. His father nodded.\r\n\r\n\"All right. I'll call you later. If I can. Just keep things going at\r\nyour end.\"\r\n\r\nA dozen of Klem Zareff's men were crowding into the room.\r\n\r\n\"This man's under close arrest,\" the old soldier was telling them. \"He\r\nis very important and very dangerous. Take him out somewhere, search\r\nhim to the skin, take his clothes away from him and give him a robe.\r\nHe's to be watched every second; make sure he hasn't poison or other\r\nsuicide means. He's to be questioned later.\"\r\n\r\nAs soon as Rodney Maxwell was off the screen, there was a call-signal.\r\nIt was one of the news-services, wanting a statement.\r\n\r\n\"I'll take it,\" Gatworth said, and then began talking:\r\n\r\n\"This statement of General Travis's is completely false. There is a\r\nMerlin, and we've found it....\"\r\n\r\nThey found something that might be good-enough Merlin for the next\r\nthirty hours. That superstructure was just big enough for the manually\r\noperated parts of a computer like Merlin; the input and output, and\r\nthe programming machines.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXX\r\n\r\n\r\nKlem Zareff's guardsmen were mercenaries. A little over a year ago\r\nthey had, at best, been homeless drifters, and not a few had been\r\noutlaws. Now they were soldiers, well fed, clothed, quartered and\r\nequipped, and well and regularly paid. They had a good thing; they\r\nwere willing to fight to keep it, Merlin or no Merlin. Conn left them\r\nto their commander. He did gather the workmen for a short harangue,\r\nbut that wasn't really necessary. They had a good thing, too, and most\r\nof them realized that they were working toward a better thing. They\r\ncould be depended upon, too.\r\n\r\nThey came crowding out and manned lifters; they got the heavy\r\ncollapsium-cutter maneuvered into place and the shielding down around\r\nthe cutting-head. After that, there were only four men who could work,\r\neach in his own heavily shielded cabin. In spite of the shielding that\r\ncovered the actual work, there was an awesome display of multicolored\r\nlight; it was like being in the middle of an aurora borealis. What was\r\ngoing on where that tiny rotating beam of cosmic rays was grinding at\r\nthe collapsium simply couldn't have been imagined.\r\n\r\nConn would have liked to stay outside; he could not. Too many things\r\nwere happening in too many places, and it was all coming in by screen.\r\nRioting had broken out in Storisende and in a dozen other places. He\r\nsaw, on a news-screen, a mob raging in front of the Executive Palace;\r\nyellow-shirted Cybernarchists were battling with city police and\r\nPlanetary troops, Armageddonists and Human Supremacy Leaguers were\r\nfighting both and one another. Above all the confused noise of\r\nshouting and shooting, an amplifier was braying: \"_It's a lie! It's a\r\nlie! Merlin has been found!_\" Newsmen began arriving--Zareff's men\r\nhad orders to pass them through the cordon that had been put up around\r\nForce Command--and they took up his time. It was worth it, though.\r\nThey could tell him what was going on.\r\n\r\nJ. Fitzwilliam Sterber called. Rodney Maxwell had been arrested, on a\r\nfarrago of fraud charges--\"I don't know who he's supposed to have\r\ndefrauded; the Planetary Government is the sole complainant\"--and bail\r\nwas being illegally denied. Sterber's lawyerly soul was outraged, but\r\nhe was grimly elated. \"You wait till things quiet down a little. We're\r\ngoing to start a false-arrest suit--\"\r\n\r\n\"If you're alive to.\" Apparently Sterber hadn't thought of that. \"What\r\ndo you think's going to happen when the Stock Exchange opens?\"\r\n\r\n\"It's going to be bad. But don't worry; your father must have foreseen\r\nsomething like this. He gave me instructions, and instructed a few\r\nmore people.\" He named some of the Trisystem Investments people and\r\nsome of the bankers. \"We're going to try to brace the market as long\r\nas we can. Nobody who keeps his head is going to lose anything in the\r\nlong run.\"\r\n\r\nLuther Chen-Wong called from Port Carpenter, on Koshchei. He and Clyde\r\nNichols and a young mathematics professor named Simon Macquarte had\r\nbeen running the colony, in Conn's absence and since Yves Jacquemont\r\nhad gone to space in the _Ouroboros II_.\r\n\r\n\"Well, they caught up with you,\" he said. Evidently he had figured out\r\nwhat the search for Merlin was all about, too. \"What do we do about\r\nit?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, we are just before finding Merlin, here. I hope we find it\r\nbefore things get too bad.\" He told Luther the situation of the\r\nmoment. \"Have you people started on another hypership yet?\"\r\n\r\n\"We're getting organized to. I don't suppose it's advisable to send\r\nany more ships in to Storisende for a while? And are you sure this\r\nthing you've found is Merlin?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know what it is. It's only big enough for the apparatus\r\nthey'd need to operate a thing like Merlin--Yes, Luther. I am sure we\r\nhave found Merlin.\"\r\n\r\nChen-Wong looked at him curiously. \"I hope so. I can't think of\r\nanything else that can stop this business.\"\r\n\r\nTom Brangwyn was in the room when he turned from the screen.\r\n\r\n\"We searched Leibert's--Shanlee's--rooms,\" he said. \"We found a bomb.\"\r\n\r\n\"What kind of a bomb?\"\r\n\r\n\"Vest-pocket thermonuclear. He seems to have gotten the fissionables\r\nby taking apart a couple of light tactical missiles; the whole thing's\r\npacked inside a hundred-pound power-cartridge case. It was in a\r\ntraveling-bag under his bed. And you know how it was to be fired? With\r\na regular 40-mm flare-pistol, welded into the end of the bomb. The\r\nflare-powder had been taken out of the cartridge, and it had been\r\nreloaded with a big charge of rifle-powder. I suppose it would blow\r\none subcritical mass into another. But the only way he could have\r\nfired the bomb would have been by pulling the trigger.\"\r\n\r\nAnd blowing himself up along with it. He must have wanted Merlin\r\ndestroyed pretty badly.\r\n\r\n\"Have you questioned him yet?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not yet. I wanted to tell you about it first.\"\r\n\r\nHe looked at his watch. Only four hours had passed since the newscast;\r\nwhy, that seemed like months, ago, now.\r\n\r\n\"All right, Tom; we'll go talk to him. Where's the Colonel?\"\r\n\r\nZareff was surrounded by a dozen screens, keeping in touch with the\r\n_Lester Dawes_ and the gunboats and combat cars, and the gun positions\r\nwith which he had ringed Force Command. It was only a little army,\r\nmaybe, but he was a busy commander-in-chief.\r\n\r\n\"You take care of it. Tell me what you get from him. I can't leave\r\nnow. There's a report of a number of aircraft approaching from the\r\nwest now....\"\r\n\r\nThey found Judge Ledue, and Kurt Fawzi and Dolf Kellton, who were just\r\nsitting around wishing there was something to do to help. They gave\r\nFranz Veltrin and Sylvie Jacquemont the job of keeping the\r\nrepresentatives of the press amused. Then they went down to the room\r\nin which General Mike Shanlee was held under guard.\r\n\r\nShanlee, wearing a bathrobe and nothing else, was lying on a cot,\r\nsleeping peacefully; three of Zareff's men were sitting on chairs,\r\nwatching him narrowly.\r\n\r\n\"All right; you can go,\" Conn told them. \"We'll take care of him.\"\r\n\r\nShanlee woke instantly; he sat up and swung his legs over the edge of\r\nthe cot.\r\n\r\n\"You have my name and rank,\" he said, and his voice no longer\r\nquavered. \"My serial number is--\" He recited a string of figures. \"And\r\nthat's all you're getting out of me.\"\r\n\r\n\"We'll get anything we want out of you,\" Conn told him. \"You know what\r\na mind-probe is? You should; your accomplices used one on my father's\r\nsecretary. She's a hopeless imbecile now. You'll be, too, when we're\r\nthrough with you. But before then, you'll have given us everything you\r\nknow.\"\r\n\r\nKellton began to protest. \"Conn, you can't do a thing like that!\"\r\n\r\n\"A mind-probe is utterly illegal; why, it's a capital offense!\" Ledue\r\nexclaimed. \"Conn I forbid you....\"\r\n\r\n\"Judge, don't make me call those guards and have you removed,\" Conn\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\n\"You can stop bluffing,\" Shanlee told him. \"Where would you get a\r\nmind-probe?\"\r\n\r\n\"Out of the Chief of Intelligence's office, here in his headquarters.\r\nI should imagine it was to be used in interrogating Alliance\r\nprisoners, during the War. I think Colonel Zareff would enjoy helping\r\nto use it on you. He used to be an Alliance officer.\"\r\n\r\nShanlee was silent. Conn sat down in one of the chairs, at the small\r\ntable.\r\n\r\n\"General Shanlee, would you describe General Foxx Travis as a man of\r\nhonor and integrity? And would you so describe yourself?\" Shanlee said\r\nnothing. \"Yet both of you have lied, deliberately and repeatedly, to\r\nconceal the existence of Merlin. And we found that bomb in your room.\r\nYou were willing to blow up this headquarters and everybody, yourself\r\nincluded, in it, to keep us from getting at Merlin. Well, you know\r\nthat we can make you tell us the truth, maybe when it's too late, and\r\nyou know that we are going to get Merlin. We're cutting the collapsium\r\noff that thing above now.\"\r\n\r\nShanlee laughed. \"You're supposed to be a computerman. You think that\r\nlittle thing could be Merlin?\"\r\n\r\n\"The controls and programming machine for Merlin.\" He turned to Kurt\r\nFawzi. \"You always claimed that Merlin was here in Force Command. You\r\nhad it backward. Force Command is inside Merlin.\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you mean, Conn?\"\r\n\r\n\"The walls; the fifty-foot walls, shielded inside and out. Merlin--the\r\ncircuitry, the memory-bank, the relays, everything--was installed\r\ninside them. What's up above is only what was needed to operate the\r\ncomputer. Isn't that true, General?\"\r\n\r\nShanlee had stopped his derisive laughter. He sat on the edge of the\r\ncot, tensing as though for a leap at Conn's throat.\r\n\r\n\"That won't help, either. If you try it, we won't shoot you. We'll\r\njust overpower you and start mind-probing right away. Now; you feel\r\nthat suppressing Merlin was worth any sacrifice. We're not\r\nunreasonable. If you can convince us that Merlin ought not to be\r\nbrought to light.... Well, you can't do any harm by talking, and you\r\nmay do some good. You may even accomplish your mission.\"\r\n\r\n\"He can't talk us out of it,\" Kurt Fawzi seemed determined to spoil\r\nthings by saying. \"Conn, I'm coming around to Klem's way of thinking.\r\nThey just don't want anybody else to have it.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, we don't,\" Shanlee said. \"We don't want the whole Federation\r\nbreaking up into bloody anarchy, and that's what'll happen if you dig\r\nthat thing up and put it into operation.\"\r\n\r\nNobody said anything except Fawzi, who began an indignant\r\ncontradiction and then subsided. Tom Brangwyn lit a cigarette.\r\n\r\n\"Would you mind letting me have one of those?\" Shanlee said. \"I\r\nhaven't had a smoke since I came here. It wouldn't have been in\r\ncharacter.\"\r\n\r\nBrangwyn took one out of the pack, lit it at the tip of his own, and\r\ngave it to Shanlee with his left hand, his right ready to strike.\r\nShanlee laughed in real amusement.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Brother!\" he reproved, in his former pious tones. \"You distrust\r\nyour fellow man; that is a sin.\"\r\n\r\nHe rose slowly, the bathrobe flapping at his bare shins, and sat down\r\nacross the table from Conn.\r\n\r\n\"All right,\" he said. \"I'll tell you about it. I'll tell you the\r\ntruth, which will be something of a novelty all around.\"\r\n\r\nShanlee puffed for a moment at the cigarette; it must really have\r\ntasted good after his long abstinence.\r\n\r\n\"You know, we were really caught off balance when the War ended. It\r\neven caught Merlin short; information lag, of course. The whole\r\nAlliance caved in all at once. Well, we fed Merlin all the data\r\navailable, and analyzed the situation. Then we did something we really\r\nweren't called upon to do, because that was policy-planning and wasn't\r\nour province, but we were going to move an occupation army into System\r\nStates planets, and we didn't want to do anything that would embarrass\r\nthe Federation Government later. We fed Merlin every scrap of\r\navailable information on political and economic conditions everywhere\r\nin the Federation, and set up a long-term computation of the general\r\neffects of the War.\r\n\r\n\"The extrapolation was supposed to run five hundred years in the\r\nfuture. It didn't. It stopped, at a point a trifle over two hundred\r\nyears from now, with a statement that no computation could be made\r\nfurther because at that point the Terran Federation would no longer\r\nexist.\"\r\n\r\nThe others, who had taken chairs facing him, looked at him blankly.\r\n\r\n\"No more Federation?\" Judge Ledue asked incredulously. \"Why, the\r\nFederation, the Federation....\"\r\n\r\nThe Federation would last forever. Anybody knew that. There just\r\ncouldn't be no more Federation.\r\n\r\n\"That's right,\" Shanlee said. \"We had trouble believing it, too.\r\nRemember, we were Federation officers. The Federation was our\r\nreligion. Just like patriotism used to be, back in the days of\r\nnationalism. We checked for error. We made detail analyses. We ran it\r\nall over again. It was no use.\r\n\r\n\"In two hundred years, there won't be any Terran Federation. The\r\nGovernment will collapse, slowly. The Space Navy will disintegrate.\r\nPlanets and systems will lose touch with Terra and with one another.\r\nYou know what it was like here, just before the War? It will be like\r\nthat on every planet, even on Terra. Just a slow crumbling, till\r\neverything is gone; then every planet will start sliding back, in\r\nisolation, into barbarism.\"\r\n\r\n\"Merlin predicted that?\" Kurt Fawzi asked, shocked.\r\n\r\nIf Merlin said so, it had to be true.\r\n\r\nShanlee nodded. \"So we ran another computation; we added the data of\r\npublication of this prognosis. You know, Merlin can't predict what you\r\nor I would do under given circumstances, but Merlin can handle\r\nlarge-group behavior with absolute accuracy. If we made public\r\nMerlin's prognosis, the end would come, not in two centuries but in\r\nless than one, and it wouldn't be a slow, peaceful decay; it would be\r\na bomb-type reaction. Rebellions. Overthrow of Federation authority,\r\nand then revolt and counterrevolt against planetary authority.\r\nDivision along sectional or class lines on individual planets.\r\nInterplanetary wars; what we fought the Alliance to prevent. Left in\r\nignorance of the future, people would go on trying to make do with\r\nwhat they had. But if they found out that the Federation was doomed,\r\neverybody would be trying to snatch what they could, and end by\r\nsmashing everything. Left in ignorance, there might be a planet here\r\nand there that would keep enough of the old civilization to serve, in\r\nfive or so centuries, as a nucleus for a new one. Informed in advance\r\nof the doom of the Federation, they would all go down together in the\r\nsame bloody shambles, and there would be a Galactic night of barbarism\r\nfor no one knows how many thousand years.\"\r\n\r\n\"We don't want anything like that to happen!\" Tom Brangwyn said, in a\r\nfrightened voice.\r\n\r\n\"Then pull everybody out of here and blow the place up, Merlin along\r\nwith it,\" Shanlee said.\r\n\r\n\"No! We'll not do that!\" Fawzi shouted. \"I'll shoot the man dead who\r\ntries it!\"\r\n\r\n\"Why didn't you people blow Merlin up?\" Conn asked.\r\n\r\n\"We'd built it; we'd worked with it. It was part of us, and we were\r\npart of it. We couldn't. Besides, there was a chance that it might\r\nsurvive the Federation; when a new civilization arose, it would be\r\nuseful. We just sealed it. There were fewer than a hundred of us who\r\nknew about it. We all took an oath of secrecy. We spent the rest of\r\nour lives trying to suppress any mention of Merlin or the Merlin\r\nProject. You have no idea how shocked both General Travis and I were\r\nwhen you told us that the story was still current here on Poictesme.\r\nAnd when we found that you'd been getting into the records of the\r\nThird Force, I took the next ship I could, a miserable little\r\nfreighter, and when I landed and found out what was happening, I\r\ncontacted Murchison and scared the life out of him with stories about\r\na secessionist conspiracy. All this Armageddonist, Human Supremacy,\r\nMerlin-is-the-Devil, stuff that's been going on was started by\r\nMurchison. And he succeeded in scaring Vyckhoven with the\r\nCybernarchists, too.\"\r\n\r\n\"This computation on the future of the Federation is still in the\r\nback-work file?\" Conn asked.\r\n\r\nShanlee nodded. \"We were criminally reckless; I can see that, now. Let\r\nme beg, again, that you destroy the whole thing.\"\r\n\r\n\"We'll have to talk it over among ourselves,\" Judge Ledue said. \"The\r\nfive of us, here, cannot presume to speak for everybody. We will, of\r\ncourse, have to keep you confined; I hope you will understand that we\r\ncannot accept your parole.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is there anything you want in the meantime?\" Conn asked.\r\n\r\n\"I would like something to smoke, and some clothes,\" General Shanlee\r\nsaid. \"And a shave and a haircut.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXI\r\n\r\n\r\nAll through the night, a shifting blaze of many-colored light rose and\r\ndimmed the stars above the mesa. They stared in awe, marveling at the\r\nenergy that was pouring out of the converters into a tiny spot that\r\ninched its way around the collapsium shielding. It must have been\r\nvisible for hundreds of miles; it was, for there was a new flood of\r\nrumors circulating in Storisende and repeated and denied by the\r\nnewscasts, now running continuously. Merlin had been found. Merlin had\r\nbeen blown up by Government troops. Merlin was being transported to\r\nStorisende to be installed as arbiter of the Government. Merlin the\r\nMonster was destroying the planet. Merlin the Devil was unchained.\r\n\r\nConn and Kurt Fawzi and Dolf Kellton and Judge Ledue and Tom Brangwyn\r\nclustered together, talking in whispers. They had told nobody, yet, of\r\nthe interview with Shanlee.\r\n\r\n\"You think it would make all that trouble?\" Kellton was asking\r\nanxiously, hoping that the others would convince him that it wouldn't.\r\n\r\n\"Maybe we had better destroy it,\" Judge Ledue faltered. \"You see what\r\nit's done already; the whole planet's in anarchy. If we let this go\r\non....\"\r\n\r\n\"We can't decide anything like that, just the five of us,\" Brangwyn\r\nwas insisting. \"We'll have to get the others together and see what\r\nthey think. We have no right to make any decision like this for them.\"\r\n\r\n\"They're no more able to make the decision than we are,\" Conn said.\r\n\r\n\"But we've got to; they have a right to know....\"\r\n\r\n\"If you decide to destroy Merlin, you'll have to decide to kill me,\r\nfirst,\" Kurt Fawzi said, his voice deadly calm. \"You won't do it while\r\nI'm alive.\"\r\n\r\n\"But, Kurt,\" Ledue expostulated. \"You know why these people here at\r\nStorisende are rioting? It's because they've lost hope, because\r\nthey're afraid and desperate. The Terran Federation is something\r\neverybody feels they have to have, for peace and order and welfare. If\r\npeople thought it was breaking up, they'd be desperate, too. They'd do\r\nthe same insane things these people here on this planet are doing.\r\nGeneral Shanlee was right. Don't destroy the hope that keeps them\r\nsane.\"\r\n\r\n\"We don't need to do that,\" Kurt Fawzi argued. \"We can use Merlin to\r\nsolve our own problems; we don't need to tell the whole Federation\r\nwhat's going to happen in two hundred years.\"\r\n\r\n\"It would get out; it couldn't help getting out,\" Ledue said.\r\n\r\n\"Let's not try to decide it ourselves,\" Conn said. \"Let's get Merlin\r\ninto operation, and run a computation on it.\"\r\n\r\n\"You mean, ask Merlin to tell us whether it ought to be destroyed or\r\nnot?\" Ledue asked incredulously. \"Let Merlin put itself on trial, and\r\nsentence itself to destruction?\"\r\n\r\n\"Merlin is a computer; computers deal only in facts. Computers are\r\nmachines; they have no sense of self-preservation. If Merlin ought to\r\nbe destroyed, Merlin will tell us so.\"\r\n\r\n\"You willing to leave it up to Merlin, Kurt?\" Tom Brangwyn asked.\r\n\r\nFawzi gulped. \"Yes. If Merlin says we ought to, we'll have to do it.\"\r\n\r\nToward noon, a telecast went out from Koshchei, on a dozen different\r\nwave-lengths. Conn, half asleep in a chair in the commander-in-chief's\r\noffice, saw Simon Macquarte, the young mathematics professor from\r\nStorisende College who had become one of the leaders of the colony,\r\nappear in the screen. The next moment, he was fully awake, shocked by\r\nMacquarte's words:\r\n\r\n\"This is not a threat; this is a solemn, even a prayerful, warning. We\r\ndo not want to use genocidal weapons of mass destruction against the\r\nworld of our birth. But whether we do or not rests solely with you.\r\n\r\n\"We came here with a dream of a better world, a world of happiness and\r\nplenty for all. We have been working, on Koshchei, to build such a\r\nworld on Poictesme. Now you are smashing that dream. When it is gone,\r\nwe will have nothing to live for--except revenge. And we will take\r\nthat revenge, make no mistake.\r\n\r\n\"We have the weapons with which to take it. Remember, this was a\r\nFederation naval base and naval arsenal during the War. Here the\r\nFederation Navy built their super-missiles, the missiles which\r\ndevastated Ashmodai, and Belphegor, and Baphomet, and hundreds of\r\nthese weapons are here. We have them, ready for launching. Once they\r\nare launched, with the robo-pilots set for targets on Poictesme, you\r\nwill have a hundred and sixty hours, at the most, to live.\r\n\r\n\"We will launch them immediately if there is another attack made upon\r\nForce Command Duplicate HQ, or upon Interplanetary Building in\r\nStorisende, or if Rodney Maxwell is killed, no matter by whom or under\r\nwhat circumstances.\r\n\r\n\"We beg you, earnestly and prayerfully, not to force us to do this\r\ndreadful thing. We speak to each one of you, for each one of you holds\r\nthe fate of the planet in his own hands.\"\r\n\r\nThe image faded from the screen. As it did, Conn was looking from one\r\nto another of the people in the room with him. All were dumbfounded,\r\nmost of them frightened.\r\n\r\n\"They wouldn't do it, would they?\" Lorenzo Menardes was asking. \"Conn,\r\nyou know those people. They wouldn't really?\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't depend on it, Lorenzo,\" Klem Zareff said. \"It's hard for a lot\r\nof people to shoot somebody ten feet away with a pistol. But just\r\nsending off a missile; that's nothing but setting a lot of dials and\r\nthen pushing a button.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm not worrying about whether they'd do it or not,\" Conn said. \"What\r\nI'm worrying about is how many people will believe they will.\"\r\n\r\nApparently a good many people did. Zareff's combat vehicles began\r\nreporting a cessation of fighting. The newscasts, repeating the\r\nultimatum from Koshchei, told of fewer and fewer disorders in the city\r\nor elsewhere; by midafternoon, the rioting had stopped.\r\n\r\nBy that time, too, Rodney Maxwell was on-screen. He was, Conn noticed,\r\nwearing his pistols again.\r\n\r\n\"What happened?\" he asked. \"They let you out on bail?\"\r\n\r\nMaxwell shook his head. \"Charges dismissed; they didn't have anything\r\nto charge me with in the first place. But they haven't let me out\r\nyet.\"\r\n\r\n\"You're wearing your guns.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, but they still have me penned up here at the Executive Palace;\r\nthey're practically keeping me in the safe. I wish our people on\r\nKoshchei hadn't mentioned me in their ultimatum; Jake Vyckhoven's\r\nafraid to let me run around loose for fear some lunatic shoots me and\r\nstarts the planetbusters coming in. Jake did one good thing, though.\r\nHe ordered the Stock Exchange closed, and declared a five-day bank\r\nholiday. By that time, you ought to have Merlin opened and working,\r\nand then the market'll be safe.\"\r\n\r\nConn simply replied, \"I hope so.\" There was no telling what kind of\r\ntaps there might be on the screen his father was using; he couldn't\r\nrisk telling him about Shanlee, or about the last computation which\r\nMerlin had made. \"If we send the _Lester Dawes_ in, do you think you\r\nmight talk them into letting you come out here?\"\r\n\r\n\"I can try.\"\r\n\r\nFlora arrived at Force Command that afternoon.\r\n\r\n\"I would have come sooner,\" she said, \"but Mother's had a complete\r\ncollapse. It happened last evening; she's in the hospital. I was with\r\nher until just an hour and a half ago. She's still unconscious.\"\r\n\r\n\"You mean she's in danger?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know. They think she's all right, except for the shock. It\r\nwas the Travis statement that did it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Think I ought to go to her?\"\r\n\r\nFlora shook her head. \"Just keep on with what you're doing here. There\r\nisn't anything you can do for her now.\"\r\n\r\n\"The best thing you can do for her, Conn, is prove that you weren't\r\nlying about Merlin,\" Sylvie told him.\r\n\r\nThe _Lester Dawes_ didn't make it from Force Command to Storisende and\r\nback until after dark, and the green and white and red and orange\r\nlights were rising in folds and waves. Rodney Maxwell had heard about\r\nhis wife's condition; it was the first thing he spoke of when Conn\r\nand Flora and Sylvie met him as he got off the ship.\r\n\r\n\"There isn't anything we can do, Father,\" Flora said. \"They'll call us\r\nwhen there's any change.\"\r\n\r\nHe said the same thing Sylvie had said. \"The only thing we can do is\r\nget that infernal thing uncovered. Once we do this, everything'll be\r\nall right. We'll show your mother that it isn't a fake and it isn't\r\nanything dangerous; we'll put a stop to all these horror-stories about\r\nmechanical devils and living machines....\"\r\n\r\nConn drew his father off where the girls couldn't overhear.\r\n\r\n\"This is something worse,\" he said. \"This is a bomb that could blow up\r\nthe whole Federation.\"\r\n\r\n\"Are you going nuts, too?\" his father demanded.\r\n\r\nConn told him about Shanlee; he repeated, almost word for word, the\r\nstory Shanlee had told.\r\n\r\n\"Do you believe that?\" his father asked.\r\n\r\n\"Don't you? You were in Storisende when the Travis statement came out;\r\nyou saw how people acted. If this story gets out, people will be\r\nacting the same way on every planet in the Federation. Not just places\r\nlike Poictesme; planets like Terra and Baldur and Marduk and Odin and\r\nOsiris. It would be the end of everything civilized, everywhere.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why didn't they use Merlin to save the Federation?\"\r\n\r\n\"It's past saving. It's been past saving since before the War. The War\r\nwas what gave it the final shove. If they could have used Merlin to\r\nreverse the process, they wouldn't have sealed it away.\"\r\n\r\n\"But you know, Conn, we can't destroy Merlin. If we did, the same\r\npeople who went crazy over the Travis statement would go crazy all\r\nover again, worse than ever. We'd be destroying everything we planned\r\nfor, and we'd be destroying ourselves. That bluff young Macquarte and\r\nLuther Chen-Wong and Bill Nichols made wouldn't work twice. And if\r\nthey weren't bluffing....\"\r\n\r\nHis father shuddered.\r\n\r\n\"And if we don't, how long do you think civilization will last here,\r\nif it blows up all over the rest of the Federation?\"\r\n\r\nThe big machine cut on, a little spot of raw energy grinding away the\r\ncollapsium, inch by inch; the undulating curtains of colored light\r\nilluminated the Badlands for miles around. Then, when the first hint\r\nof dawn came into the east, they went out. The steady roar of the\r\ngenerators that had battered every ear for over twenty-four hours\r\nstopped. There was unbelieving silence, and then shouts.\r\n\r\nThe workmen swarmed out to man lifters. Slowly the heavy\r\napparatus--the reactor and the converters, the cutting machine, and\r\nthe shielding around it--was lifted away. Finally, a lone lifter came\r\nin and men in radiation-suits went down to hook on grapples, and it\r\nlifted away, carrying with it a ten-foot-square sheet of thin steel\r\nthat weighed almost thirty tons.\r\n\r\nWhen they had battered a hole in the vitrified rock underneath, guards\r\nbrought up General Shanlee. Somebody almost up to professional\r\nstandards had given him a haircut; the beard was gone, too. A\r\nFederation Army officer's uniform had been found reasonably close to\r\nhis size, and somebody had even provided him with the four stars of\r\nhis retirement rank. He was, again, the man Conn had seen in the\r\ndome-house on Luna.\r\n\r\n\"Well, you got it open,\" he said, climbing down from the airjeep that\r\nhad brought him. \"Now, what are you going to do with it?\"\r\n\r\n\"We can't make up our minds,\" Conn said. \"We're going to let the\r\ncomputer tell us what to do with it.\"\r\n\r\nShanlee looked at him, startled. \"You mean, you're going to have\r\nMerlin judge itself and decide its own fate?\" he asked. \"You'll get\r\nthe same result we did.\"\r\n\r\nThey let a ladder down the hole and descended--Conn and his father,\r\nKurt Fawzi, Jerry Rivas, then Shanlee and his two guards, then\r\nothers--until a score of them were crowded in the room at the bottom,\r\ntheir flashlights illuminating the circular chamber, revealing\r\nceiling-high metal cabinets, banks of button- and dial-studded control\r\npanels, big keyboards. It was Shanlee who found the lights and put\r\nthem on.\r\n\r\n\"Powered from the central plant, down below,\" he said. \"The main\r\ncables are disguised as the grounding-outlet. If this thing had been\r\non when you put on the power, you'd have had an awful lot of power\r\ngoing nowhere, apparently.\"\r\n\r\nRodney Maxwell was disappointed. \"I know this stuff looks awfully\r\ncomplex, but I'd have expected there to be more of it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I didn't get a chance to tell you about that. This is only the\r\noperating end,\" Conn said, and then asked Shanlee if there were\r\ninspection-screens. When Shanlee indicated them, he began putting them\r\non. \"This is the real computer.\"\r\n\r\nThey all gave the same view, with minor differences--long corridors,\r\nten feet wide, between solid banks of steel cabinets on either side.\r\nConn explained where they were, and added:\r\n\r\n\"Kurt and the rest of them were sitting here, all this time, wondering\r\nwhere Merlin was; it was all around them.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, how did you get up here?\" Fawzi asked. \"We couldn't find\r\nanything from below.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, you couldn't.\" Shanlee was amused. \"Watch this.\"\r\n\r\nIt was so simple that nobody had ever guessed it. Below, back of the\r\nCommander-in-chief's office, there was a closet, fifteen feet by\r\ntwenty. They had found it empty except for some bits of discarded\r\noffice-gear, and had used it as a catch-all for everything they wanted\r\nout of the way. Shanlee went to where four thick steel columns rose\r\nfrom floor to ceiling in a rectangle around a heavy-duty lifter,\r\npressing a button on a control-box on one of them. The lifter, and the\r\nfloor under it, rose, with a thick mass of vitrified rock underneath.\r\nThe closet, full of the junk that had been thrown into it, followed.\r\n\r\n\"That's it,\" he said. \"We just tore out the controls inside that and\r\npatched it up a little. There's a sheet of collapsium-plate under the\r\nfloor. Your scanners simply couldn't detect anything from below.\"\r\n\r\nConfident that Merlin would decree its own destruction, Shanlee gave\r\nhis parole; the others accepted it. The newsmen were admitted to the\r\ncircular operating room and encouraged to send out views and\r\ndescriptions of everything. Then the lift controls were reinstalled,\r\nthe lid was put back on top, and the only access to the room was\r\nthrough the office below. The entrance to this was always guarded by\r\nZarel's soldiers or Brangwyn's police.\r\n\r\nThere were only a score of them who could be let in on the actual\r\nfacts. For the most part, they were the same men who had been in\r\nFawzi's office on the afternoon of Conn's return, a year and a half\r\nago. A few others--Anse Dawes, Jerry Rivas, and five computermen Conn\r\nhad trained on Koshchei--had to be trusted. Conn insisted on letting\r\nSylvie Jacquemont in on the revised Awful Truth About Merlin. They\r\nspent a lot of their time together, in Travis's office, for the most\r\npart sunk in dejection.\r\n\r\nThey had finally found Merlin; now they must lose it. They were trying\r\nto reconcile themselves and take comfort from the achievement, empty\r\nas it was. They could see no way out. If Merlin said that Merlin had\r\nto be destroyed, that was it. Merlin was infallible. Conn hated the\r\nthought of destroying that machine with his whole being, not because\r\nit was an infallible oracle, but because it was the climactic\r\nmasterpiece of the science he had spent years studying. To destroy it\r\nwas an even worse sacrilege to him than it was to the Merlinolators.\r\nAnd Rodney Maxwell was thinking of the public effects. What the Travis\r\nstatement had started would be nothing by comparison.\r\n\r\n\"You know, we can keep the destruction of Merlin a secret,\" Conn said.\r\n\"It'll take some work down at the power plant, but we can overload all\r\nthe circuits and burn everything out at once.\" He turned to Shanlee.\r\n\"I don't know why you people didn't think of that.\"\r\n\r\nShanlee looked at him in surprise. \"Why, now that you mention it,\r\nneither do I,\" he admitted. \"We just didn't.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then,\" Conn continued, \"we can tinker up something in the operating\r\nroom that'll turn out what will look like computation results. As far\r\nas anybody outside ourselves will know, Merlin will still be solving\r\neverybody's problems. We'll do like any fortuneteller; tell the\r\ncustomer what he wants to believe and keep him happy.\"\r\n\r\nMore lies; lies without end. And now he'd have a machine to do his\r\nlying for him, a dummy computer that wouldn't compute anything. And\r\nall he'd wanted, to begin with, had been a ship to haul some brandy to\r\nwhere they could get a fair price for it.\r\n\r\nPeace had returned. At first, it had been a frightened and uneasy\r\npeace. The bluff--he hoped that was what it had been--by the Koshchei\r\ncolonists had shocked everybody into momentary inaction. In the\r\ntwenty-four hours that had followed, the forces of sanity and order\r\nhad gotten control again. Merlin existed and had been found. As for\r\nTravis's statement, the old general had been bound by a wartime oath\r\nof secrecy to deny Merlin's existence. The majority relaxed, ashamed\r\nof their hysterical reaction. As for the Cybernarchists and\r\nArmageddonists and Human Supremacy Leaguers, government and private\r\npolice, vastly augmented by volunteers, speedily rounded up the\r\nleaders; their followers dispersed, realizing that Merlin was nothing\r\nbut a lot of dials and buttons, and interestedly watching the\r\nbroadcast views of it.\r\n\r\nThe banks were still closed, but discreet back-door withdrawals were\r\npermitted to keep business going; so was the Stock Exchange, but word\r\nwas going around the brokerage offices that Trisystem Investments was\r\nin the market for a long list of securities. Nobody was willing to do\r\nanything that might upset the precarious balance; everybody was\r\ntalking about the bright future, when Merlin would guide Poictesme to\r\never greater and more splendid prosperity.\r\n\r\nConn's father and sister flew to Litchfield; Flora stayed with her\r\nmother, and Rodney Maxwell returned to Force Command, shaking his head\r\ngravely.\r\n\r\n\"She's still unconscious, Conn,\" he said. \"She just lies there, barely\r\nbreathing. The doctors don't know.... I wish Wade hadn't gone on the\r\nship.\"\r\n\r\nThe price of what he had wanted to do was becoming unendurably high\r\nfor Conn.\r\n\r\nThey ran off the computations Merlin had made forty years before, and\r\nrechecked them. There had been no error. The Terran Federation,\r\noverextended, had been cracking for a century before the War; the\r\nstrain of that conflict had started an irreversible breakup. Two\r\ncenturies for the Federation as such; at most, another century of\r\nirregular trade and occasional war between independent planets, Galaxy\r\nfull of human-populated planets as poor as Poictesme at its worst. Or,\r\naware of the future, sudden outbursts of desperate violence, then\r\nanarchy and barbarism.\r\n\r\nIt took a long time to set up the new computation. Forty years\r\nof history for almost five hundred planets had to be abstracted\r\nand summarized and translated from verbal symbols to the\r\nelectro-mathematical language of computers and fed in. Conn and Sylvie\r\nand General Shanlee and the three men and two women Conn had taught on\r\nKoshchei worked and rested briefly and worked again. Finally, it was\r\nfinished.\r\n\r\n\"General; you're the oldest Merlin hand,\" Conn said, gesturing to the\r\nred button at the main control panel, \"You do it.\"\r\n\r\n\"You do it, Conn. None of us would be here except for you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank you, General.\"\r\n\r\nHe pressed the button. They all stood silently watching the output\r\nslot.\r\n\r\nEven a positronic computer does not work instantaneously. Nothing\r\ndoes. Conn took his eyes from the slot from which the tape would come,\r\nand watched the second-hand of the clock above it. The wait didn't\r\nseem like hours to him; it only seemed like seventy-five seconds, that\r\nway. Then the bell rang, and the tape began coming out.\r\n\r\nIt took another hour and a half of button-punching; the Braille-like\r\nsymbols on the tape had to be retranslated, and even Merlin couldn't\r\ndo that for itself. Merlin didn't think in human terms.\r\n\r\nIt was the same as before. In ignorance, the peoples of the Federation\r\nworlds would go on, striving to keep things running until they wore\r\nout, and then sinking into apathetic acceptance. Deprived of hope,\r\nthey would turn to frantic violence and smash everything they most\r\nwanted to preserve. Conn pushed another button.\r\n\r\nThe second information-request went in: _What is the best course to be\r\nfollowed under these conditions by the people of Poictesme?_ It had\r\ntaken some time to phrase that in symbols a computer would find\r\ncomprehensible; the answer, at great length, emerged in two minutes\r\neight seconds. Retranslating it took five hours.\r\n\r\nIn the beginning and for the first ten years, it was, almost item for\r\nitem, the Maxwell Plan. Export trade, specialized in luxury goods.\r\nBrandies and wines, tobacco; a long list of other exportable\r\ncommodities, and optimum markets. Reopening of industrial plants;\r\nestablishment of new industries. Attainment of economic\r\nself-sufficiency. Cultural self-sufficiency; establishment of\r\nuniversities, institutes of technology, research laboratories. Then\r\nthe Maxwell Plan became the Merlin Plan; the breakup of the Federation\r\nwas a fact that entered into the computation. Build-up of military\r\nstrength to resist aggression by other planetary governments. Defense\r\nof the Gartner Trisystem. Lists of possible aggressor planets. Revival\r\nof interstellar communications and trade; expeditions, conquest and\r\nre-education of natives....\r\n\r\n\"We can't begin to handle this without Merlin,\" Conn said. \"If that\r\nmeans blowing up the Federation, let it blow. We'll start a new one\r\nhere.\"\r\n\r\n\"No; if there's a general, violent collapse of the Federation, it'll\r\nspread to Poictesme,\" Shanlee told him. \"Let's ask Merlin the big\r\nquestion.\"\r\n\r\nMerlin took a good five minutes to work that one out. The question had\r\nto include a full description of Merlin, and a statement of the\r\ninformation which must be kept secret. The answer was even more\r\nlengthy, but it was summed up in the first word: _Falsification_.\r\n\r\n\"So Merlin's got to be a liar, too, along with the rest of us!\" Sylvie\r\ncried. \"Conn, you've corrupted his morals!\"\r\n\r\nThe rest of it was false data which must be taped in, and lists of\r\ncorrections which must be made in evaluating any computation into\r\nwhich such data might enter. There was also a statement that, after\r\nfifty years, suppression of the truth and circulation of falsely\r\noptimistic statements about the Federation would no longer have any\r\nimportance.\r\n\r\n\"Well, that's it,\" Conn said. \"Merlin thought himself out of a death\r\nsentence.\"\r\n\r\nThey crowded into the lift and went down to the office below.\r\nEverybody who knew what had been going on upstairs was there. Most of\r\nthem were nursing drinks; almost everybody was smoking. All of them\r\nwere silent, until Judge Ledue took his cigar from his mouth.\r\n\r\n\"Has the jury reached a verdict?\" he asked, clinging with courtroom\r\nformality to his self-control.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, your Honor. We find the defendant, Merlin, not guilty as\r\ncharged.\"\r\n\r\nIn the uproar his words released, Rodney Maxwell got to his feet and\r\ncame quickly to Conn.\r\n\r\n\"Flora called just a while ago. Your mother is conscious; she's asking\r\nfor us. Flora says she seems perfectly normal.\"\r\n\r\n\"We'll go right away; take a recon-car. General, will you explain\r\nthings till I get back? Sylvie, do you want to come with us?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXII\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was autumn again, the second autumn since he had landed from the\r\n_City of Asgard_ at Storisende and taken the _Countess Dorothy_ home\r\nto Litchfield. Again the fields were bare and brown; all up and down\r\nthe Gordon Valley the melons were harvested, and the wine-pressing was\r\nready to start.\r\n\r\nThe house was crowded today. All top-level Litchfield seemed to have\r\nturned out, and there were guests from Storisende, and even a few who\r\nhad made the trip from Koshchei to be there, Simon Macquarte, the\r\npresident of Koshchei Tech; Conn would always remember him in the\r\nscreen threatening a whole planet with devastation. Luther Chen-Wong,\r\nthe chief executive of Koshchei Colony. Clyde Nichols, the president\r\nof Koshchei Airlines.\r\n\r\nHe almost bumped into Yves Jacquemont, coming in from the hall.\r\nJacquemont's beard had been trimmed down to a small imperial, and he\r\nwas wearing the uniform of Trisystem & Interstellar Spacelines,\r\nnothing at all like a Federation Space Navy uniform. He was laughing\r\nabout something; he threw an arm over Conn's shoulder, and they went\r\ninto the front parlor together.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Gehenna of a big crop!\" he heard Klem Zareff's voice, chuckling\r\nhappily, above the babble in the room. \"You wouldn't believe it. Why,\r\nwe had to build six new vats....\"\r\n\r\nThe thin-faced, white-haired man in the chair beside him said\r\nsomething. Mike Shanlee and Klem Zareff, old enemies, were now fast\r\nfriends. Shanlee had come in from Force Command with Conn that\r\nmorning. He had stayed on Poictesme as nominal head of Project Merlin,\r\nand intended to remain there for the rest of his life.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, there aren't any more farm-tramps,\" Zareff replied. \"Everybody's\r\ngetting factory jobs off-planet. I have an awful time getting help,\r\nand what I can get won't work for less than ten sols a day. Why,\r\nthey're even organizing a union....\"\r\n\r\nThere were feminine shrieks from across the room, and a stampede. The\r\nhousecleaning-robot had come in, running its vacuum-cleaning hose\r\naround and brandishing its mops. He saw his mother break away from a\r\ngroup of older ladies and shout:\r\n\r\n\"_Oscar!_\"\r\n\r\nThe robot stopped dead. \"Yash'm?\" a voice came out of it,\r\nSheshan-accented.\r\n\r\n\"Go out!\" his mother commanded. \"Go to kitchen. Stay there.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yash'm.\" The robot floated out the door to the hall.\r\n\r\nHis mother rejoined her friends. Probably telling them, for the\r\nthousandth time, that her boy Conn fixed up the sound receptors and\r\nvoice for Oscar. Or harping on how Conn had been telling everybody the\r\ntruth, all along, and people wouldn't believe him.\r\n\r\nSylvie came up to him and caught his arm. \"Come on, Conn; they're\r\ngoing to start the rehearsal,\" she said.\r\n\r\n\"They've been going to start it for an hour,\" her father told her.\r\n\r\n\"Well, they're really going to start it now.\"\r\n\r\n\"All right. You two run along,\" Yves Jacquemont said. \"And you'd\r\nbetter start rehearsing for your own wedding before long. The _Genji_\r\nwill be ready to hyper out in another month, and I don't want to be at\r\nspace when my only daughter gets married.\"\r\n\r\nThey pushed through the crowd, dragging Conn's mother with them toward\r\nthe big living room beyond. On the way, Mrs. Maxwell stopped to try to\r\ndrag Judge Ledue out of a chair.\r\n\r\n\"Judge, the rehearsal is starting; they can't do it without you.\"\r\n\r\nLedue clung to his chair. \"They daren't do it with me, Mrs. Maxwell.\r\nIf I get into it, it won't be a rehearsal; they'll be really married,\r\nand then there won't be any point in having a wedding tomorrow.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Morgan!\" Conn called across the room to Gatworth. \"You've just\r\nbeen appointed temporary judge for the wedding rehearsal!\"\r\n\r\nThere was a big crowd around Wade Lucas, in the next room; he was\r\ntelling them about the voyage to Baldur, from which he had returned,\r\nand the one to Irminsul, with a cargo of arms, machine tools and\r\ncontragravity vehicles, on which he and his bride would go for their\r\nhoneymoon. There was another crowd around Flora; she was telling them\r\nabout the new fashions on Baldur, which had been brought back on the\r\n_Ouroboros II_.\r\n\r\n\"Where's your father?\" his mother was asking him. \"He has to rehearse\r\ngiving the bride away.\"\r\n\r\n\"Probably in his office. I'll go get him.\"\r\n\r\n\"You'll get into an argument with somebody and forget to come back,\"\r\nhis mother said. \"Sylvie, you go with him, and bring both of them\r\nback.\"\r\n\r\n\"When'll we have our wedding, Sylvie?\" he asked as they went off\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\n\"Well, before Dad goes to Aditya with the _Genji_. That'll have to be\r\nin a month.\"\r\n\r\n\"Two weeks? That ought to be plenty of time to get ready, and let\r\npeople recover from this one.\"\r\n\r\n\"Everybody's here now. Let's make it a double wedding tomorrow,\" she\r\nsuggested.\r\n\r\nHe hadn't been prepared for that. \"Well, I hadn't expected.... Sure!\r\nGood idea!\" he agreed.\r\n\r\nThere was a crowd in Rodney Maxwell's little office--Fawzi and some\r\nothers, and some Storisende people. One of the latter was\r\nvociferating:\r\n\r\n\"Jake Vyckhoven's no good, and he never was any good!\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, you have to admit, if he hadn't ordered the banks and the Stock\r\nExchange closed that time, we'd have had a horrible panic--\"\r\n\r\n\"Admit nothing of the kind! Jethro, you were there, you'll bear me\r\nout. About a dozen of us were at Executive Palace for hours, bullying\r\nhim into that. Why, we almost had to twist one of his arms while he\r\nwas signing the order with the other. And now he has the gall to run\r\nfor re-election on the strength of his heroic actions at the time of\r\nthe Travis Hoax!\"\r\n\r\n\"I know who we want for President!\" another Storisende man exclaimed.\r\n\"He's right here in this room!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes!\" Rodney Maxwell almost bellowed, before the other man could say\r\nanything else. \"Here he is!\" He grabbed Kurt Fawzi by the arm and\r\nyanked him to his feet. \"Here's the man most responsible for finding\r\nMerlin; the man who first suggested sending my son Conn to Terra to\r\nschool, the man who, more than anyone else, devoted his life to the\r\nsearch for Merlin, the man whose inextinguishable faith and\r\nindomitable courage kept that search alive through its darkest hours.\r\nEverybody, get a drink; a toast to our next President, Kurt Fawzi!\"\r\n\r\nConn was sure he heard his father add: \"Ghu, what a narrow escape!\"\r\n\r\nThen he and Sylvie began chanting, in unison, \"_We want Fawzi! We want\r\nFawzi!_\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you enjoyed this novel, you will also want to read:\r\n\r\nSPACE VIKING\r\nby\r\nH.

And\r\nthey all believed that when this super-gigantic computer was located\r\namid the mountains of surplus equipment that was the planet's sole\r\nsource of revenue, it would mean Utopia for everyone.\r\n\r\nConn Maxwell knew different. He had studied the records on Earth and\r\nhe thought he knew the true facts about this cosmic computer. To tell\r\nthem would be to panic Poictesme, so instead he set about a new search\r\nin his own way--with startling results.\r\n\r\nH. Beam Piper, author of SPACE VIKING, has again produced an original\r\nand unusual novel of the space future.",
