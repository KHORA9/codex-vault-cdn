WILEY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE TO VOLUME THIRD.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe concluding volume of the Principles and Practice of Agricultural\r\nAnalysis has been written in harmony with the plan adopted at the\r\ncommencement of the first volume. In it an effort has been made to\r\nplace the analyst or student _en rapport_ with all the best methods of\r\nstudying the composition of agricultural products. During the progress\r\nof the work the author has frequently been asked why some special\r\nmethod in each case has not been designated as the proper one to be\r\nused. To do this would be a radical departure from the fundamental\r\nidea of the work; _viz._, to rely on the good judgment and experience\r\nof the chemist. It is not likely that the author’s judgment in such\r\nmatters is better than that of the analyst using the book, and, except\r\nfor beginning students pursuing a course of laboratory instruction, a\r\nbiased judgment is little better than none at all. For student’s work\r\nin the laboratory or classroom it is probable that a volume of selected\r\nmethods based on the present work may be prepared later on, but this\r\npossible future need has not been allowed to change the purpose of\r\nthe author as expressed in the preface of the second volume “to\r\npresent to the busy worker a broad view of a great subject.” For the\r\ncourtesy and patience of the publishers, for the uniformly commendatory\r\nnotices of the reviewers of volumes one and two, and for the personal\r\nencouraging expressions of his professional brethren the author is\r\nsincerely grateful. He finds in this cordial reception of his book a\r\ngrateful compensation for long years of labor. The plates of the first\r\nedition of the three volumes have been destroyed in order to insure a\r\nre-writing of the second edition when it shall be demanded, in order\r\nto keep it abreast of the rapid progress in the field of agricultural\r\nchemical analysis.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, D.

Introduction.=—The analyst may approach the examination of\r\nagricultural products from various directions. In the first place\r\nhe may desire to know their proximate and ultimate constitution\r\nirrespective of their relations to the soil or to the food of man and\r\nbeast. Secondly, his study of these products may have reference solely\r\nto the determination of the more valuable plant foods which they have\r\nextracted from the soil and air. Lastly, he may approach his task from\r\na hygienic or economic standpoint for the purposes of determining the\r\nwholesomeness or the nutritive and economic values of the products\r\nof the field, orchard, or garden. In each case the object of the\r\ninvestigation will have a considerable influence on the method of the\r\nexamination.\r\n\r\nIt will be the purpose of the present volume to discuss fully the\r\nprinciples of all the standard processes of analysis and the best\r\npractice thereof, to the end that the investigator or analyst, whatever\r\nmay be the design of his work, may find satisfactory directions for\r\nprosecuting it. As in the previous volumes, it should be understood\r\nthat these pages are written largely for the teacher and the analyst\r\nalready skilled in the principles of analytical chemistry. Much is\r\ntherefore left to the individual judgment and experience of the worker,\r\nto whom it is hoped a judicious choice of approved processes may be\r\nmade possible.\r\n\r\n=2. Scope Of the Work.=—Under the term agricultural products is\r\nincluded a large number of classes of bodies of most different\r\nconstitution. In general they are the products of vegetable and animal\r\nmetabolism. First of all come the vegetable products, fruits, grains\r\nand grasses. These may be presented in their natural state, as cereals,\r\ngreen fruits and fodders, or after a certain preparation, as starches,\r\nsugars and flours. They may also be met with in even more advanced\r\nstages of change, as cooked foods, alcohols and secondary organic\r\nacids, such as vinegar. In general, by the term agricultural products\r\nis meant not only the direct products of the farm, orchard and forest,\r\nbut also the modified products thereof and the results of manufacture\r\napplied to the raw materials. Thus, not only the grain and straw of\r\nwheat are proper materials for agricultural analysis, but also flour\r\nand bran, bread and cakes made therefrom. In the case of maize and\r\nbarley, the manufactured products may extend much further, for not only\r\ndo we find starch and malt, but also alcohol and beer falling within\r\nthe scope of our work. In respect of animal products, the agricultural\r\nanalyst may be called on to investigate the subject of leather and\r\ntanning; to determine the composition of meat, milk and butter; to\r\npass upon the character of lard, oleomargarine, and, in general, to\r\ndetermine as fully as possible the course of animal food in all its\r\nchanges between the field, the packing house and the kitchen.\r\n\r\n=3. Limitations of Work.=—It is evident from the preceding paragraph,\r\nthat in order to keep the magnitude of this volume within the limits\r\nfixed for a single volume the text must be rigidly confined to the\r\nfundamental principles and practice of agricultural analysis. The\r\ninteresting region of pharmacy and allied branches, in respect of\r\nplant analysis, can find no description here, and in those branches\r\nof technical chemistry, where the materials of elaboration are the\r\nproducts of the field only a superficial view can be given. The main\r\npurpose and motive of this volume must relate closely to the more\r\npurely agricultural processes.\r\n\r\n=4. General Manipulations.=—There are certain analytical operations\r\nwhich are more or less of a general nature, that is, they are of\r\ngeneral application without reference to the character of the material\r\nat hand. Among these may be mentioned the determination of moisture\r\nand of ash, and the estimation of matters soluble in ether, alcohol and\r\nother solvents. These processes will be first described. Preliminary to\r\nthese analytical steps it is of the utmost importance that the material\r\nbe properly prepared for examination. In general, this is accomplished\r\nby drying the samples until they can be ground or crushed to a fine\r\npowder, the attrition being continued until all the particles are made\r\nto pass a sieve of a given fineness. The best sieve for this purpose\r\nis one having circular apertures half a millimeter in diameter. Some\r\nproducts, both vegetable and animal, require to be reduced to as fine\r\na state as possible without drying. In such instances, passing the\r\nproduct through a sieve is obviously impracticable. Special grinding\r\nand disintegrating machines are made for these purposes and they will\r\nbe described further on.\r\n\r\nThere are some agricultural products which have to be prepared for\r\nexamination in special ways and these methods will be given in\r\nconnection with the processes for analyzing the bodies referred\r\nto. Nearly all the bodies, however, with which the analyst will be\r\nconcerned, can be prepared for examination by the general methods about\r\nto be described.\r\n\r\n=5. Preparation of the Sample.= (_a_) _Vegetable Substances._—For all\r\nprocesses of analysis not executed on the fresh sample, substances of\r\na vegetable nature should, if in a fresh state, be dried as rapidly\r\nas possible to prevent fermentative changes. It is often of interest\r\nto determine the percentage of moisture in the fresh sample. For this\r\npurpose a representative portion of the sample should be rapidly\r\nreduced to as fine a condition as possible. To accomplish this it\r\nshould be passed through a shredding machine, or cut by scissors or a\r\nknife into fine pieces. A few grams of the shredded material are dried\r\nin a flat-bottomed dish at progressively increasing temperatures,\r\nbeginning at about 60° and ending at from 100° to 110°. The latter\r\ntemperature should be continued for only a short time. The principle of\r\nthis process is based upon the fact that if the temperature be raised\r\ntoo high at first, some of the moisture in the interior cells of the\r\nvegetable substance can be occluded by the too rapid desiccation of\r\nthe exterior layers which would take place at a high temperature. The\r\nspecial processes for determining moisture will be given in another\r\nplace.\r\n\r\nThe rest of the sample should be partly dried at a lower temperature\r\nor air-dried. In the case of fodders and most cattle foods the samples\r\ncome to the analyst in a naturally air-dried state. When grasses are\r\nharvested at a time near their maturity they are sun-dried in the\r\nmeadows before placing in the stack or barn. Such sun-dried samples are\r\nalready in a state fit for grinding. Green grasses and fodders should\r\nbe dried in the sun, or in a bath at a low temperature from 50° to\r\n60° until all danger of fermentative action is over, and then air- or\r\nsun-dried in the usual way.\r\n\r\nSeeds and cereals usually reach the analyst in a condition suited to\r\ngrinding without further preliminary preparation. Fruits and vegetables\r\npresent greater difficulties. Containing larger quantities of water,\r\nand often considerable amounts of sugar, they are dried with greater\r\ndifficulty. The principles which should guide all processes of drying\r\nare those already mentioned, _viz._, to secure a sufficient degree of\r\ndesiccation to permit of fine grinding and at a temperature high enough\r\nto prevent fermentative action, and yet not sufficiently high to cause\r\nany marked changes in the constituents of the vegetable organism.\r\n\r\n(_b_) _Animal Substances._—The difficulties connected with the\r\npreliminary treatment of animal substances are far greater than those\r\njust mentioned. Such samples are composed of widely differing tissues,\r\nblood, bone, tendon, muscle and adipose matters, and all the complex\r\ncomponents of the animal organism are to be considered. The whole\r\nanimal may be presented for analysis, in which case the different parts\r\ncomposing it should be separated and weighed as exactly as possible.\r\nWhere only definite parts are to be examined it is best to separate the\r\nmuscle, bone, and fat as well as may be, before attempting to reduce\r\nthe whole to a fine powder. The soft portions of the sample are to be\r\nground as finely as possible in a meat or sausage cutter. The bones\r\nare crushed in some appropriate manner, and thus prepared for further\r\nexamination. Where the flesh and softer portions are to be dried and\r\nfinely ground, the presence of fat often renders the process almost\r\nimpossible. In such cases the fat must be at least partially removed\r\nby petroleum or other solvent. In practically fat-free samples the\r\nmaterial, after grinding in a meat cutter, can be partially dried at\r\nlow temperatures from 60° to 75°, and afterwards ground in much the\r\nsame manner as is practiced with vegetable substances.\r\n\r\nAs is the case with the preliminary treatment of vegetable matters,\r\nit is impossible to give any general directions of universal\r\napplicability. The tact and experience of the analyst in all these\r\ncases are better than any dicta of the books. In some instances, as\r\nwill appear further on, definite directions for given substances can be\r\ngiven, but in all cases the general principles of procedure are on the\r\nlines already indicated.\r\n\r\n=6. Preserving Samples.=—In most cases, as is indicated in the\r\nforegoing paragraphs, the sample may be dried before grinding to such a\r\ndegree as to prevent danger from fermentation or decay. The fine-ground\r\nsamples are usually preserved in glass-stoppered bottles, carefully\r\nmarked or numbered. In some cases it is advisable to sterilize the\r\nbottles after stoppering, by subjecting them to a temperature of 100°\r\nfor some time. In the case of cereals assurance should be had that the\r\nsamples do not contain the eggs of any of the pests that often destroy\r\nthese products. As a rule, samples should be kept for a time after the\r\ncompletion of the analytical work, and this is especially true in all\r\ncases where there is any prospect of dispute or litigation. In general\r\nit may be said, that samples should be destroyed only when they are\r\nspoiled, or when storage room is exhausted.\r\n\r\n=7. Collecting Samples.=—When possible, the analyst should be his\r\nown collector. There is often as much danger from data obtained on\r\nnon-representative samples as from imperfect manipulation. When\r\npersonal supervision is not possible, the sample when received,\r\nshould be accompanied by an intelligible description of the method of\r\ntaking it, and of what it represents. In all cases the object of the\r\nexamination must be kept steadily in view. Where comparisons are to be\r\nmade the methods of collecting must be rigidly the same.\r\n\r\nThe processes of analysis, as conducted with agricultural products,\r\nare tedious and difficult. The absolutely definite conditions that\r\nattend the analysis of mineral substances, are mostly lacking. The\r\nsimple determinations of carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen and sulfur,\r\nwhich are required in the usual processes of organic analysis, are\r\nsimplicity itself when compared with the operations which have to be\r\nperformed on agricultural products to determine their character and\r\ntheir value as food and raiment. We have to do here with matters on\r\nwhich the sustenance, health and prosperity of the human race are more\r\nintimately concerned than with any other of the sciences. This fact\r\nalso emphasizes the necessity for care in collecting the materials on\r\nwhich the work is to be performed.\r\n\r\n=8. Grinding Samples.=—In order to properly conduct the processes of\r\nagricultural analysis it is important to have the sample finely ground.\r\nThis arises both from the fact that such a sample is apt to contain an\r\naverage content of the various complex substances of which the material\r\nunder examination is composed, and because the analytical processes can\r\nbe conducted with greater success upon the finely divided matter. In\r\nmineral analysis it is customary to grind the sample to an impalpable\r\npowder in an agate mortar. With agricultural products, however, such\r\na degree of fineness is difficult to attain, and moreover, is not\r\nnecessary. There is a great difference of opinion among analysts\r\nrespecting the degree of fineness desirable. In some cases we must be\r\ncontent with a sample which will pass a sieve with a millimeter mesh;\r\nin fact it may be found impossible, on account of the stickiness of the\r\nmaterial, to sift it at all. In such cases a thorough trituration, so\r\nas to form a homogeneous mass will have to be accepted as sufficient.\r\nWhere bodies can be reduced to a powder however, it is best to pass\r\nthem through a sieve with circular perforations half a millimeter in\r\ndiameter. A finer degree of subdivision than this is rarely necessary.\r\n\r\n=9. The Grinding Apparatus.=—The simplest form of apparatus for\r\nreducing samples for analysis to a condition suited to passing a fine\r\nsieve is a mortar. Where only a few samples are to be prepared and in\r\nsmall quantities, it will not be necessary to provide anything further.\r\nAfter the sample is well disintegrated it is poured on the sieve and\r\nall that can pass is shaken or brushed through. The sieve is provided\r\nwith a receptacle, into which it fits closely, to avoid loss of any\r\nparticles which may be reduced to a dust. The top of the sieve, when\r\nshaken, may also be covered if there be any tendency to loss from dust.\r\nAny residue failing to pass the sieve is returned to the mortar and\r\nthe process thus repeated until all the material has been secured in\r\nthe receiver. The particles more difficult of pulverization are often\r\ndifferent in structure from the more easily pulverized portions, and\r\nthe sifted matter must always be carefully mixed before the subsample\r\nis taken for examination. Often the materials, or portions thereof,\r\nwill contain particles tough and resistant to the pestle, but the\r\noperator must have patience and persistence, for it is highly necessary\r\nto accurate work that the whole sample be reduced to proper size.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 1. MILL FOR GRINDING DRY SAMPLES.]\r\n\r\nWhere many samples are to be prepared, or in large quantities, mills\r\nshould take the place of mortars. For properly air-dried vegetable\r\nsubstances, some form of mill used in grinding drugs may be employed.\r\nGrinding surfaces of chilled corrugated steel are to be preferred.\r\nThe essential features of such a mill are that it be made of the best\r\nmaterial, properly tempered, and that the parts be easily separated\r\nfor convenience in cleaning. The grinding surfaces must also be so\r\nconstructed and adjusted as to secure the proper degree of fineness.\r\nIn fig. 1 is shown a mill of rather simple construction, which has\r\nlong been in satisfactory use in this laboratory. Small mills may\r\nbe operated by hand power, but when they are to be used constantly\r\nsteam power should be provided. In addition to the removal of nearly\r\nall the moisture by air-drying there are many oleaginous seeds which\r\ncannot be finely ground until their oil has been removed. For this\r\npurpose the grinding surfaces of the mill are opened so that the seeds\r\nare only coarsely broken in passing through. The fragments are then\r\ndigested with light petroleum in a large flask, furnished with a reflux\r\ncondenser. After digestion the fragments are again passed through the\r\nmill adjusted to break them into finer particles.\r\n\r\nThe alternate grinding and digestion are thus continued until the\r\npulverization is complete. On a small specially prepared sample the\r\ntotal content of oil is separately determined.\r\n\r\nFresh animal tissues are best prepared for preliminary treatment by\r\npassing through a sausage mill. The partially homogeneous mass thus\r\nsecured should be dried at a low temperature and reground as finely as\r\npossible. Where much fat is present it may be necessary to extract it\r\nas mentioned above, in the case of oleaginous seeds. In such cases both\r\nthe moisture and fat in the original material should be determined on\r\nsmall specially prepared samples with as great accuracy as possible.\r\nBones, hoofs, horns, hair and hides present special difficulties in\r\npreparation, which the analyst will have to overcome with such skill\r\nand ingenuity as he may possess.\r\n\r\nThe analyst will find many specially prepared animal foods already in\r\na fairly homogeneous form, such as potted and canned meats, infant\r\nand invalid foods, and the like. Even with these substances, however,\r\na preliminary grinding and mixing will be found of advantage before\r\nundertaking the analytical work. Many cases will arise which are\r\napparently entirely without the classification given above. But even in\r\nsuch instances the analyst should not be without resources. Frequently\r\nsome dry inert substance may be mixed with the material in definite\r\nquantities, whereby it is rendered more easily prepared. Perhaps no\r\ncase will be presented where persistent and judicious efforts to secure\r\na fairly homogeneous sample for analysis will be wholly unavailing.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 2. COMMINUTOR FOR GREEN SAMPLES.]\r\n\r\nIn the case of green vegetable matters which require to be reduced\r\nrapidly to a fine state of subdivision in order to secure even a\r\nfairly good sample some special provision must be made. This is\r\nthe case with stalks of maize and sugar cane, root crops, such as\r\npotatoes and beets, and green fodders, such as clover and grasses.\r\nThe chopping of these bodies into fine fodders by hand is slow and\r\noften impracticable. The particles rapidly lose moisture and it is\r\nimportant to secure them promptly as in the preparation of beet pulp\r\nfor polarization. For general use we have found the apparatus shown\r\nin fig. 2 quite satisfactory in this laboratory. It consists of a\r\nseries of staggered circular saws carried on an axis and geared to be\r\ndriven at a high velocity, in the case mentioned, 1,400 revolutions\r\nper minute. The green material is fed against the revolving saws by\r\nthe toothed gear-work shown, and is thus reduced to a very fine pulp,\r\nwhich is received in the box below. Stalks of maize, green fodders,\r\nsugar canes, beets and other fresh vegetable matters are by this\r\nprocess reduced to a fine homogeneous pulp, suited for sampling and for\r\nanalytical operations. Such pulped material can also be spread in a\r\nfine layer and dried rapidly at a low temperature, thus avoiding danger\r\nof fermentative changes when it is desired to secure the materials in\r\na dry condition or to preserve them for future examination. Samples of\r\nsorghum cane, thus pulped and dried, have been preserved for many years\r\nwith their sugar content unchanged.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 3. RASP FOR SUGAR BEETS.]\r\n\r\nSuch a machine is also useful in preparing vegetable matter for the\r\nseparation of its juices in presses. Samples of sugar cane, sugar\r\nbeets, apples and other bodies of like nature can thus be prepared to\r\nsecure their juices for chemical examination. Such an apparatus we\r\nhave found is fully as useful and indispensable in an agricultural\r\nlaboratory as a drug mill for air-dried materials.\r\n\r\nIt is often desirable in the preparation of roots for sugar analysis\r\nto secure them in a completely disintegrated state, that is with the\r\ncellular tissues practically all broken. Such a pulped material can\r\nbe treated with water and the sugar juices it contains thus at once\r\ndistributed to all parts of the liquid mass. The operation is known\r\nas instantaneous diffusion. The pulp of the vegetable matter is thus\r\nintroduced into the measuring flask along with the juices and the\r\ncontent of sugar can be easily determined. Several forms of apparatus\r\nhave been devised for this purpose, one of which is shown in fig.\r\n3. This process, originally devised by Pellet, has come into quite\r\ngeneral use in the determination of the sugar content of beets.[1]\r\nIt is observed that it can be applied to other tubers, such as the\r\nturnip, potato, artichoke, etc. It is desirable, therefore, that\r\nan agricultural laboratory be equipped with at least three kinds\r\nof grinding machines; _viz._, first, the common drug mill used for\r\ngrinding seeds, air-dried fodders, and the like; second, a pulping\r\nmachine like the system of staggered saws above described for the\r\npurpose of reducing green vegetable matter to a fine state of\r\nsubdivision, or one like the pellet rasp for tubers; third, a mill for\r\ngeneral use such as is employed for making sausages from soft animal\r\ntissues.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 4. DREEF GRINDING APPARATUS.]\r\n\r\n=10. Grinding Apparatus at Halle Station.=—The machine used at the\r\nHalle station for grinding samples for analysis is shown in Fig. 4.[2]\r\nIt is so adjusted as to have both the upper and lower grinding surfaces\r\nin motion. The power is transmitted through the pulley D, which is\r\nfixed to an axis carrying also the inner grinding attachment B. Through\r\nC₂, C₃, C₄, and C₁, the reverse motion is transmitted to the outer\r\ngrinder A. By means of the lever E the two grinding surfaces can be\r\nseparated when the mill is to be cleaned. The dree mill above described\r\nis especially useful for grinding malt, dry brewers’ grains, cereals\r\nfor starch determinations and similar dry bodies. It is not suited to\r\ngrinding oily seeds and moist samples. These, according to the Halle\r\nmethods, are rubbed up in a mortar until of a size suited to analysis,\r\nand samples such as moist residues, wet cereals, mashes, beet cuttings,\r\nsilage, etc., are dried before grinding. If it be desired to avoid the\r\nloss of acids which may have been formed during fermentation, about ten\r\ngrams of magnesia should be thoroughly incorporated with each kilogram\r\nof the material before drying.\r\n\r\n=11. Preliminary Treatment of Fish.=—The method used by Atwater in\r\npreparing fish for analysis is given below.[3] The same process may\r\nalso be found applicable in the preparation of other animal tissues.\r\nThe specimens, when received at the laboratory, are at once weighed.\r\nThe flesh is then separated from the refuse and both are weighed. There\r\nis always a slight loss in the separation, due to evaporation and to\r\nslimy and fatty matters and small fragments of the tissues which adhere\r\nto the hands and the utensils employed in preparing the sample. Perfect\r\nseparation of the flesh from the other parts of the fish is difficult,\r\nbut the loss resulting from imperfect separation is small. The skin\r\nof the fish, although it has considerable nutritive value, should be\r\nseparated with the other refuse.\r\n\r\nThe partial drying of the flesh for securing samples for analytical\r\nwork is accomplished by chopping it as finely as possible and\r\nsubjecting from fifty to one hundred grams of it for a day to a\r\ntemperature of 96° in an atmosphere of hydrogen. After cooling and\r\nallowing to stand in the open air for twelve hours, the sample is again\r\nweighed, and then ground to a fine powder and made to pass a sieve\r\nwith a half millimeter mesh. If the samples be very fat they cannot\r\nbe ground to pass so fine a sieve. In such a case a coarser sieve may\r\nbe used or the sample reduced to as fine and homogeneous a state as\r\npossible, and bottled without sifting.\r\n\r\nThe reason for drying in hydrogen is to prevent oxidation of the fats.\r\nAs will be seen further on, however, such bodies can be quickly and\r\naccurately dried at low temperatures in a vacuum, and thus all danger\r\nof oxidation be avoided. In fact, the preliminary drying of all animal\r\nand vegetable tissues, where oxidation is to be feared, can be safely\r\naccomplished in a partial vacuum by methods to be described in another\r\nplace. In order to be able to calculate the data of the analysis to the\r\noriginal fresh state of the substance, a portion of the fresh material\r\nshould have its water quantitively determined as accurately as possible.\r\n\r\n\r\nDRYING ORGANIC BODIES.\r\n\r\n=12. Volatile Bodies.=—In agricultural analysis it becomes necessary\r\nto determine the percentage of bodies present in any given sample\r\nwhich is volatile at any fixed temperature. The temperature reached by\r\nboiling water is the one which is usually selected. It is true that\r\nthis temperature varies with the altitude and within somewhat narrow\r\nlimits at the same altitude, due to variations in barometric pressure.\r\nAs the air pressure to which any given body is subjected, however, is a\r\nfactor in the determination of its volatile contents, it will be seen\r\nthat within the altitudes at which chemical laboratories are found,\r\nthe variations in volatile content will not be important. This arises\r\nfrom the fact that while water boils at a lower temperature, as the\r\nheight above the sea level increases, the corresponding diminished\r\nair pressure permits a more ready escape of volatile matter. As a\r\nconsequence, a body dried to constant weight at sea level, where the\r\ntemperature of boiling water is 100°, will show the same percentage\r\nof volatile matter as if dried at an altitude where water boils at\r\n99°. When, therefore, it is desirable to determine the volatile matter\r\nin a sample approximately at 100°, it is better to direct that it be\r\ndone in a space surrounded by steam at the natural pressure rather\r\nthan at exactly 100°, a temperature somewhat difficult to constantly\r\nmaintain. However, where it is directed or desired to dry to constant\r\nweight exactly at 100°, it can be accomplished by means of an air-bath\r\nor by a water-jacketed-bath under pressure, or to which enough solid\r\nmatter is added to raise the boiling-point to 100°. It is not often,\r\nhowever, that it is worth while to make any special efforts to secure a\r\ntemperature of 100°. When bodies are to be dried at temperatures above\r\n100°, such as 105°, 110°, and so on, an air-bath is the most convenient\r\nmeans of securing the desired end. The different kinds of apparatus to\r\nbe employed will be described in succeeding paragraphs.\r\n\r\n=13. Drying at the Temperature of Boiling Water.=—The best apparatus\r\nfor this process is so constructed as to have an interior space\r\nentirely surrounded with boiling water or steam, with the exception\r\nof the door by which entrance is gained thereto. The metal parts of\r\nthe apparatus are constructed of copper, and to keep a constant level\r\nof water and avoid the danger of evaporating all the liquid, it is\r\nadvisable to have a reflux condenser attached to the apparatus. It is\r\nalso well to secure entrance to the interior drying oven, not only by\r\nthe door, but also by small circular openings, which serve both to\r\nhold a thermometer and to permit of the aspiration of a slow stream\r\nof dry air through the apparatus during the progress of desiccation.\r\nThe gaseous bodies formed by the volatilization of the water and other\r\nmatters are thus carried out of the drying box and the process thereby\r\naccelerated. The bath should be heated by a burner so arranged as to\r\ndistribute the flame as evenly as possible over the base. A single\r\nlamp, while it will boil the water in the center, will not keep it at\r\nthe boiling-point on the sides. The temperature of the interior of the\r\nbath will not therefore reach 100°. The interior of the oven should be\r\ncoated with a non-detachable carbon paint to promote the radiation of\r\nthe heat from its walls, as well as to protect the parts from oxidation\r\nwhere acid fumes are produced during desiccation. Instead of a reflux\r\ncondenser a constant water level may be maintained in the bath by means\r\nof a mariotte bottle or other similar device.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 5. WATER-JACKETED DRYING OVEN.]\r\n\r\nWhen a bath of this kind is arranged for use with a partial vacuum, it\r\nshould be made cylindrical in shape, with conical ends, as shown in\r\nfig. 5, in order to bear well the pressure to which it is subjected.\r\nAmong the many forms of steam-baths offered, the analyst will have\r\nbut little difficulty in selecting one suited to his work. To avoid\r\nradiation the exterior of the apparatus should be covered with a\r\nnon-conducting material.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 6. THERMOSTAT FOR STEAM-BATH.]\r\n\r\n=14. Drying In a Closed Water Oven.=—When it is desired to keep the\r\ntemperature of a drying oven exactly at 100° instead of at the heat of\r\nboiling water, a closed water oven with a thermostat is to be employed.\r\nThe oven should be so constructed as to secure a free circulation of\r\nthe water about the inner space. Since as a rule the water between the\r\nwalls of the apparatus will be subjected to a slight pressure, these\r\nwalls should be made strong, or the cylindrical form of apparatus\r\nshould be used. The thermostat used by the Halle Station is shown in\r\nFig. 6.[4] A =⋃= shaped tube, with a bulb on one arm and a lateral\r\nsmaller tube sealed on the other, is partly filled with mercury and\r\nconnected by rubber tubes on the right with the gas supply, and on\r\nthe left with the burner. The end carrying the bulb is connected\r\ndirectly by a rubber and metal tube with the water space of the oven.\r\nThis device is provided with a valve which is left open until the\r\ntemperature of the drying space reaches about 95°. The tube conducting\r\nthe gas is held in the long arm of the =⋃= by means of a cork through\r\nwhich it passes air-tight and yet is loose enough to permit of its\r\nbeing moved. Its lower end is provided with a long ▲ shaped slit.\r\nWhen the valve leading to the water space is closed and the water\r\nreaches the boiling point, the pressure of the vapor depresses the\r\nmercury in the bulb arm of the =⋃= and raises it in the other. As the\r\nmercury rises it closes the wider opening of the ▲ shaped slit, thus\r\ndiminishing the flow of gas to the burner. By moving the gas entry\r\ntube up or down a position is easily found in which the temperature of\r\nthe drying space, as shown by the thermometer, is kept accurately and\r\nconstantly at 100°.\r\n\r\nIn a bath arranged in this way a steam condenser is not necessary.\r\nSince, however, in laboratories which are not at a higher altitude than\r\n1,000 feet the boiling-point of water is nearly 100°, it does not seem\r\nnecessary to go to so much trouble to secure the exact temperature\r\nnamed. There could be no practical difference in the percentage of\r\nmoisture determined at 100°, and at the boiling-point of water at a\r\ntemperature not more than 1° lower.\r\n\r\n=15. Drying in an Air-Bath.=—In drying a substance in a medium of hot\r\nair surrounded by steam, as has been described, the process is, in\r\nreality, one of drying in air. The apparatus usually meant by the term\r\nair-bath, however, has its drying space heated directly by a lamp, or\r\nindirectly by a stratum of hot air occupying the place of steam in the\r\noven already described. The simplest form of the apparatus is a metal\r\nbox, usually copper, heated from below by a lamp. In the jacketed forms\r\nthe currents of hot air produced directly or indirectly by the lamp\r\nare conducted around the inner drying oven, thus securing a more even\r\ntemperature. The bodies to be dried are held on perforated metal or\r\nasbestos shelves in appropriate dishes, and the temperature to which\r\nthey are subjected is determined by a thermometer, the bulb of which is\r\nbrought as near as possible to the contents of the dish. One advantage\r\nof the air-bath is in being able to secure almost any desired\r\ntemperature from that of the room to one of 150° or even higher. Its\r\nchief disadvantage lies in the difficulty of securing and maintaining\r\nan even temperature throughout all parts of the apparatus. Radiation\r\nfrom the sides of the drying oven should be prevented by a covering of\r\nasbestos or other non-combustible and non-conducting substance. The\r\nburner employed should be a broad one and give as even a distribution\r\nof the heat as possible over the bottom of the apparatus.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 7. SPENCER’S DRYING OVEN.]\r\n\r\n=16. Spencer’s Air-Drying Oven.=—In order to secure an even\r\ndistribution of the heat in the desiccating space of the oven, Spencer\r\nhas devised an apparatus, shown in the figure, in which the temperature\r\nis maintained evenly throughout the apparatus by means of a fan.[5]\r\nThe oven has a double bottom, the space between the two bottoms being\r\nfilled with air. The sides are also double, the space between being\r\nfilled with plaster. The fan is driven by a toy engine connected with\r\nthe compressed air service or other convenient method. Thermometers\r\nplaced in different parts of the apparatus, while in use, show a\r\nrigidly even heat at all points so long as the fan is kept in motion.\r\nThe actual temperature desired can be controlled by a gas regulator.\r\nThis form of apparatus is well suited to drying a large number of\r\nsamples at once. Portions of liquids and viscous masses may also be\r\ndried by enclosing them in bulbs and connecting with a vacuum.\r\n\r\nSpencer’s oven can also be used to advantage in drying viscous\r\nliquids in a partial vacuum. For this purpose the flask A, Fig. 7,\r\ncontaining the substance is made with a round bottom to resist the\r\natmospheric pressure. Its capacity is conveniently from 150 to 200\r\ncubic centimeters. It is closed with a rubber stopper carrying a trap,\r\nH Hʹ, to keep the evaporated water from falling back. The details of\r\nthe construction of the trap H are shown at the right of the figure.\r\nThe vapors enter at the lateral orifice, just above the bulb, while the\r\ncondensed water falls back into the bulb instead of into the flask A.\r\nA series of flasks can be used at once connected through the stopcocks\r\nG with the circular tube E leading to the vacuum. A water pump easily\r\nexhausts the apparatus, maintaining a vacuum of about twenty-seven\r\ninches. The hot air in the oven is kept in motion by the fan B, thus\r\nensuring an even temperature in every part. The flask A may be partly\r\nfilled with sand or pumice stone before the addition of the samples\r\nto be dried, and the weight of water lost is determined by weighing\r\nA before and after desiccation. If it be desired to introduce a slow\r\ncurrent of dry air or some inert gas into A, it is easily accomplished\r\nby passing a small tube, connected with the dry air or gas supply,\r\nthrough the rubber stopper and extending it into the flask as far as\r\npossible without coming into contact with the contents.\r\n\r\n=17. Drying Under Diminished Air Pressure.=—The temperature at which\r\nany given body loses its volatile products is conditioned largely\r\nby the pressure to which it is subjected. At an air pressure of 760\r\nmillimeters of mercury, water boils at 100° but it is volatilized\r\nat all temperatures. As the pressure diminishes the temperature at\r\nwhich a body loses water at a given rate falls. This is a fact of\r\nimportance to be considered in drying many agricultural products. This\r\nis especially true of those containing oils and sugars, nearly the\r\nwhole number. Invert sugar especially is apt to suffer profound changes\r\nat a temperature of 100°, the levulose it contains undergoing partial\r\ndecomposition. Oils are prone to oxidation and partial decomposition at\r\nhigh temperatures in the presence of oxygen.\r\n\r\nIn drying in a partial vacuum therefore a double advantage is secured,\r\nthat of a lower temperature of desiccation and in presence of less\r\noxygen. It is not necessary to have a complete vacuum. There are few\r\norganic products which cannot be completely deprived of their volatile\r\nmatters at a temperature of from 70° to 80° in a partial vacuum in\r\nwhich the air pressure has been diminished to about one-quarter of its\r\nnormal force.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 8. ELECTRIC VACUUM DRYING OVEN.]\r\n\r\n=18. Electric Drying-Bath.=—The heat of an electric current can be\r\nconveniently used for drying in a partial vacuum by means of the\r\nsimple device illustrated in Fig. 8. In ordering a heater of this kind\r\nthe voltage of the current should be stated. The current in use in this\r\nlaboratory has a voltage of about 120, and is installed on the three\r\nwire principle. It is well to use a rheostat with the heater in order\r\nto control the temperature within the bell jar. The ground rim of the\r\nbell jar rests on a rubber disk placed on a thick ground glass or a\r\nmetal plate, making an air-tight connection. A disk of asbestos serves\r\nto separate the heater from the dish containing the sample, in order to\r\navoid too high a temperature.\r\n\r\n=19. Steam Coil Apparatus.=—For drying at the temperature of\r\nsuperheated steam, it is convenient to use an apparatus furnished with\r\nlayers or coils of steam pipes. The drying may be accomplished either\r\nin the air or in a vacuum. In this laboratory a large drying oven,\r\nhaving three shelves of brass steam-tubes and sides of non-conducting\r\nmaterial, is employed with great advantage. The series of heating\r\npipes is so arranged as to be used one at a time or collectively. Each\r\nseries is furnished with a separate steam valve, and is provided with\r\na trap to control the escape of the condensed vapors. In the bottom of\r\nthe apparatus are apertures through which air can enter, which after\r\npassing through the interior of the oven escapes through a ventilator\r\nat the top. With a pressure of forty pounds of steam to the square inch\r\nand a free circulation of air, the temperature on the first shelf of\r\nthe apparatus is about 98°; on the second from 103° to 104°, and on\r\nthe third about 100°. The vessels containing the bodies to be dried\r\nare not placed directly on the brass steam pipes, but the latter are\r\nfirst covered with thick perforated paper or asbestos. For drying\r\nlarge numbers of samples, or large quantities of one sample, such an\r\napparatus is almost indispensable to an agricultural laboratory.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 9. STEAM COIL DRYING OVEN.]\r\n\r\nA smaller apparatus is shown in Fig. 9. The heating part G is made of\r\na small brass tube arranged near the bottom in a horizontal coil and\r\ncontinued about the sides in a perpendicular coil. Bodies placed on the\r\nhorizontal shelf are thus entirely surrounded by the heating surfaces\r\nexcept at the top.[6] The steam pipe S is connected with the supply\r\nby the usual method, and the escape of the condensation is controlled\r\neither by a valve or trap in the usual way. The whole apparatus is\r\ncovered by a bell jar B, resting on a heavy cast-iron plate P, through\r\nwhich also the ends of the brass coil pass. The upper surface of the\r\niron plate may be planed, or a planed groove may be cut into it, to\r\nsecure the edge of the bell jar. When the air is to be exhausted from\r\nthe apparatus, a rubber washer should be placed under the rim of the\r\nbell jar. The latter piece of apparatus may either be closed, as shown\r\nin the figure, by a rubber stopper, or it is better, though not shown,\r\nto have a stopper with three holes. One tube passes just through the\r\nstopper and is connected with the vacuum; the second passes to the\r\nbottom of the apparatus and serves to introduce a slow stream of dry\r\nair or of an inert gas during the desiccation. The third hole is for\r\na thermometer. When no movement of the residual gas in the apparatus\r\nis secured, a dish containing strong sulfuric acid S’ is placed on the\r\niron plate and under the horizontal coil, as is shown in the figure.\r\nThe sulfuric acid so placed does not reach the boiling-point of water,\r\nand serves to absorb the aqueous vapors from the residual air in the\r\nbell jar. By controlling the steam supply the desiccation of a sample\r\ncan be secured in the apparatus at any desired temperature within the\r\nlimit of the temperature of steam at the pressure used. Where no steam\r\nservice is at hand a strong glass flask may be used as a boiler, in\r\nwhich case the trap end of the coil must be left open. The vacuum may\r\nbe supplied by an air or bunsen pump. When a vacuum is not used an\r\natmosphere of dry hydrogen may be supplied through H.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 10. CARR’S VACUUM DRYING OVEN.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 10. (BIS) VACUUM OVEN OPEN.]\r\n\r\n=20. Carr’s Vacuum Oven.=—A convenient drying oven has been devised in\r\nthis laboratory by Carr.[7] It is made of a large tube, preferably\r\nof brass. The tube may be from six to nine inches in diameter and\r\nfrom twelve to fifteen inches long. One end is closed air-tight by\r\na brass end-piece attached by a screw, or brazed. The other end is\r\ndetachable and is made air-tight by ground surfaces and a soft washer.\r\nIn the figure this movable end-piece is shown attached by screw-nuts,\r\nbut experience has shown that these are not necessary. On the upper\r\nlongitudinal surfaces are apertures for the insertion of a vacuum gauge\r\nand for attachment to a vacuum apparatus.\r\n\r\nIn the figure the thermometer and aperture for introducing dry air or\r\nan inert gas are shown in the movable end disk, but they would be more\r\nconveniently placed in the fixed end. The oven is heated below by a gas\r\nburner, which conveniently should be as long as the oven. The heat is\r\nnot allowed to strike the brass cylinder directly, but the latter is\r\nprotected by a piece of asbestos paper.\r\n\r\nThe temperature inside of the oven can be easily kept practically\r\nconstant by means of a gas regulator, not shown in the figure, or\r\nby a little attention to the lamp. For a vacuum of twenty inches a\r\ntemperature of about 80° should be maintained. When the vacuum is more\r\ncomplete a lower temperature can be employed. This apparatus is simple\r\nin construction, strong, cheap, and highly satisfactory in use.\r\n\r\n=21. Drying in Hydrogen.=—In some of the processes of agricultural\r\nanalysis it becomes important to dry the sample in hydrogen or other\r\ninert gas. This may be accomplished by introducing the dry gas desired\r\ninto some form of the apparatus already described. The drying may\r\neither be accomplished in an atmosphere of hydrogen practically at rest\r\nor in a more limited quantity of the gas in motion. The latter method\r\nis to be preferred by reason of its greater rapidity. The analyst\r\nhas at his command many forms of apparatus designed for the purpose\r\nmentioned above. It will be sufficient here to describe only two,\r\ndevised particularly for agricultural purposes.\r\n\r\nThe first one of these, designed by the author, was intended especially\r\nfor drying the samples of fodders for analysis according to the methods\r\nof the Association of Agricultural Chemists.[8]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 11. APPARATUS FOR DRYING IN A CURRENT OF\r\nHYDROGEN.]\r\n\r\nFor the purpose of drying materials contained in flasks and tubes\r\nin a current of hydrogen the apparatus shown in Fig. 11 is used.\r\nThis apparatus consists of a circular box, B, conveniently made of\r\ngalvanized iron, having a movable cover, S, fitted for the introduction\r\nof steam into the interior of the apparatus. Condensed steam escapes at\r\nW. A stream of perfectly pure and dry hydrogen enters at H, passes up\r\nthrough the material to be dried, down through the bulb V, containing\r\nsulfuric acid, and follows the direction of the arrows through the rest\r\nof the apparatus. The stream of hydrogen is thus completely dried by\r\npassing through bulbs containing sulfuric acid, on the way from one\r\npiece of the apparatus to the other. A, represents a flask such as is\r\nused, with the extraction apparatus described. The apparatus which we\r\nhave used will hold eight tubes or flasks at a time, and thus a single\r\nstream of hydrogen is made to do duty eight times in drying eight\r\nseparate samples. The great advantage of the apparatus is in the fact\r\nthat the stream of hydrogen must pass over and through the substance\r\nto be dried. In order to prevent any sulfuric acid from being carried\r\nforward into the next tube the bulb K, above the sulfuric acid, may be\r\nfilled with solid pieces of soda or potash.\r\n\r\nThis apparatus has been in use for a long time and no accidents from\r\nsulfuric acid being carried forward have occurred, and there is no\r\ndanger, provided the stream of hydrogen is kept running at a slow\r\nrate. If, however, by any accident the stream of hydrogen should be\r\nadmitted with great rapidity, particles of the sulfuric acid might be\r\ncarried forward and spoil the next sample. To avoid any such accident\r\nas this the proposal to introduce the potash bulb has been made. The\r\napparatus works with perfect satisfaction, and it is believed that when\r\nproperly adjusted check weighings can be made by weighing the bulbs,\r\nshowing their increase in weight, which will give the volatile matter,\r\nand weighing the flasks or tubes, which will show the loss of weight.\r\nThe only chance for error in weighing the bulbs is that some of the\r\nvolatile matter may be material which is not dissolved in sulfuric\r\nacid, and is thus carried on and out of the apparatus. The blackening\r\nof the sulfuric acid in the bulbs, in the drying of all forms of\r\norganic matter, shows that the loss in weight of such bodies is not\r\ndue to water alone, but also to organic volatile substances, which are\r\ncapable of being decomposed by the sulfuric acid, thus blackening it.\r\n\r\n=22. Caldwell’s Hydrogen Drying-Bath.=—An excellent device for drying\r\nin hydrogen has been described by Caldwell.[9] A vessel of copper or\r\nother suitable material serves to hold the tubes containing the samples\r\nto be dried. It should be about twenty-four centimeters long, fifteen\r\nhigh, and eight wide. This vessel is contained in another made of the\r\nsame material and of the dimensions shown in the figure. On one side\r\nthe edge of this containing vessel may not be more than one centimeter\r\nhigh and the bath should rest against it. The other side is made higher\r\nto form a support for the drying tubes as indicated.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 12. CALDWELL’S HYDROGEN DRYING APPARATUS.]\r\n\r\nThe tube containing the substance _a d_ is made of glass and may be\r\nclosed by the ground stoppers _c b_ or the tube stoppers _e f_. At _a_\r\nit carries a perforated platinum disk for holding the filtering felt.\r\nThe tube should be about thirteen centimeters long and have an internal\r\ndiameter of about twenty millimeters. With its stoppers it should weigh\r\nonly a little over thirty grams. The asbestos felt should not be thick\r\nenough to prevent the free passage of gas. Passing diagonally through\r\nthe bath are metal tubes, preferably made of copper, and of such a\r\nsize as just to receive the glass drying tubes. If these be a little\r\nloose they should be made tight by wrapping them with a narrow coil of\r\npaper at either end of the tubular receptacle. The entrance of cold\r\nair between the glass tube and its metal holder is thus prevented, and\r\nthe glass tube is held firmly in position. The glass tube should be\r\nweighed with its two solid stoppers. Afterwards the sample, about two\r\ngrams, is placed on the asbestos felt and the stoppers replaced and\r\nthe whole reweighed. The exact weight of the sample is thus obtained.\r\nThe solid stoppers are then removed and the tube stoppers inserted.\r\nThe lower end of the tube is then connected with the supply of dry\r\nhydrogen. The upper tube stopper is connected by a rubber tube with\r\na small bottle containing sulfuric acid through which the escaping\r\nhydrogen is made to bubble. A double purpose is thus secured; moisture\r\nis kept from entering the drying tube and the rate at which the\r\nhydrogen is passing is easily noted. After the drying is completed the\r\nsolid stoppers are again inserted, the tube cooled in a desiccator and\r\nweighed. The loss of weight is entered as water. The tube containing\r\nthe sample can afterwards be put into an extractor and treated with\r\nether or petroleum in the manner hereafter described. This apparatus\r\nrequires more hydrogen than the one previously described, but it is\r\nrather simple in construction, is easily controlled, and has given\r\nsatisfactory results.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 13. LIEBIG’S ENTE.]\r\n\r\n=23. Drying in Liebig’s Tubes.=—In drying samples, especially of\r\nfodders, the method practiced at the Halle Station is to place them\r\nin drying tubes, the form of which is shown in Fig. 13. A stream of\r\nilluminating gas, previously dried by passing over sulfuric acid and\r\ncalcium chlorid, is directed through the tubes.[10] Many of these tubes\r\ncan be used at once, arranged as shown in Fig. 14. When the air is all\r\ndriven out the stream of gas can be ignited so as to regulate the flow\r\nproperly by the size of the flame. The tubes are held in drying ovens,\r\nas shown in the figure, the temperature of which should be kept at\r\n105°-107°. The drying should be continued for eight or ten hours. At\r\nthe end of this time the gas in the tube is to be expelled by a stream\r\nof dry air and the tubes cooled in a desiccator and weighed. There are\r\nfew advantages in this method not possessed by the processes already\r\ndescribed. The samples, moreover, are not left in a condition for\r\nfurther examination, either by incineration or extraction.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 14. DRYING APPARATUS USED AT THE HALLE STATION.]\r\n\r\n=24. Wrampelmayer’s Drying Oven.=—The apparatus used at the Wageningen\r\nStation, in Holland, for drying agricultural samples, was devised by\r\nWrampelmayer and is shown in Fig. 15. The oven is so constructed as\r\nto permit of drying in a stream of inert gas. Illuminating gas is\r\nlet into the drying space of the oven through the tube A B. At B the\r\nentering gas is heated by the same lamp which boils the liquid in the\r\nwater space of the apparatus. The hot gas is dried in the calcium\r\nchlorid tube c and then passes into the oven at D. At E it leaves the\r\napparatus and is thence conducted to the lamp F, used for heating the\r\nbath. The lamp should be closed by a wire gauze diaphragm to prevent\r\nany possible explosion by reason of any admixture with the air in the\r\noven. The condensation of the aqueous vapors is effected by means of\r\nthe condenser G. In the drying space is a small shelf holder, which,\r\nby means of the hook H, can be removed from the apparatus. The drying\r\nspace is closed from the upper part of the apparatus, which contains no\r\nwater by the cover J, resting on a support K. This rim is covered with\r\na rubber gasket L, by means of which the cover J can be fastened with a\r\nbayonet latch air-tight. This fastening is shown at N. Being closed in\r\nthis way the part of the cylindrical oven above the cover may be left\r\nentirely open. Instead of the rather elaborate method of closing the\r\nbath, some simple and equally effective device might be used. The cover\r\nJ is best made with double metallic walls enclosing an asbestos packing.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 15. WRAMPELMAYER’S OVEN.]\r\n\r\nIt is evident that this oven could be used with an atmosphere of carbon\r\ndioxid or of air, provided the gas for heating were derived from a\r\nseparate source and the tube between E and F broken. In a drying oven\r\ndesigned by the author, the movable top is made with double walls and\r\nthe space between is joined to the steam chamber by means of a flexible\r\nmetallic tube, thus entirely surrounding the drying space with steam.\r\n\r\n=25. The Ulsch Drying Oven.=—A convenient drying oven is described\r\nby Ulsch which varies from the ordinary form of a water-jacketed\r\ndrying apparatus in having a series of drying tubes inserted in the\r\nwater-steam space.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 16. ULSCH DRYING OVEN.]\r\n\r\nThe arrangement of the oven is shown in the accompanying figure. The\r\nwater space is filled only to about one-third of its height. When the\r\nheat is applied the cock _c_ is left open until the steam has driven\r\nout all the air. It is then closed and the temperature of the bath is\r\nthen regulated by the manometer _e_, connected with the bath by _d_.\r\nThe bottom of the manometer cylinder contains enough mercury to always\r\nkeep sealed the end of the manometer tube. The rest of the space is\r\nfilled with water. At the top the manometer tube is expanded into a\r\nsmall bulb which serves as a gas regulator, as shown in the figure. The\r\ngas is admitted also by a small hole above the mercury in the bulb,\r\nso that when the end of the gas inlet tube is sealed enough gas still\r\npasses through to keep the lamp burning. With a mercury pressure of\r\nthirty centimeters the temperature of the bath will be about 105°. The\r\nwalls of the bath should be made strong enough to bear the pressure\r\ncorresponding to this degree. The drying can be accomplished either in\r\nthe cubical drying box _a_ or in the drying tubes made of thin copper\r\nand disposed as shown in the figure. The natural draft is shown by the\r\narrows. The substance is held in boats placed in the tube as indicated.\r\nThe air in traversing the tube is brought almost to the temperature of\r\nthe water-steam space in which the tube lies. The natural current of\r\nhot air can easily be replaced by a stream of dry illuminating or other\r\ninert gas.\r\n\r\n=26. Drying Viscous Liquids.=—In the case of cane juices, milk,\r\nand similar substances, the paper coil method may be used.[11] The\r\nmanipulation is conducted as follows: A strip of filtering paper from\r\nfive to eight centimeters wide and forty centimeters in length, is\r\nrolled into a loose coil and dried at the temperature of boiling water\r\nfor two hours, placed in a dry glass-stoppered weighing tube, cooled\r\nin a desiccator and weighed. The stoppered weighing tube prevents the\r\nabsorption of hygroscopic moisture. About three cubic centimeters of\r\nthe viscous or semi-viscous liquid are placed in a flat dish covered\r\nby a plate of thin glass and weighed. The coil is then placed on end\r\nin the dish, and the greater part of the liquid is at once absorbed.\r\nThe proportions between the coil and the amount of liquid should be\r\nsuch that the coil will not be saturated more than two-thirds of its\r\nlength. It is then removed and placed dry end down in a steam-bath\r\nand dried two hours. The dish, covered by the same plate of glass,\r\nis again weighed, the loss in weight representing the quantity of\r\nliquid absorbed by the coil. After drying for the time specified the\r\ncoil is again placed in the hot weighing tube, cooled and its weight\r\nascertained. The increase represents the solid matter in the sample\r\ntaken. This method has been somewhat modified by Josse, who directs\r\nthat it be conducted as follows:[12] Filter-paper is cut into strips\r\nfrom one to two centimeters wide and three meters long. The strips are\r\ncrimped so they will not lie too closely together and then wrapped\r\ninto coils. These coils can absorb about ten cubic centimeters of\r\nliquid. One of them is placed in a flat dish about two centimeters\r\nhigh and seven in diameter, and dried as described, covered, cooled\r\nand weighed. There are next placed in the dish and weighed one or two\r\ngrams of the massecuite, molasses, etc., which are to be dried and the\r\ndish again weighed and the total weight of the matter added, determined\r\nby deducting the weight of the dish and cover. About eight cubic\r\ncentimeters of water are added, the material dissolved with gentle\r\nwarming, the coil placed in the dish, and the whole dried for two\r\nhours. The cover is then replaced and the whole cooled in a desiccator\r\nand weighed. The increase in weight represents the dry matter in the\r\nsample taken.\r\n\r\nThe above method of solution of a viscous sample in order to divide\r\nit evenly for desiccation is based on the principle of the method\r\nfirst proposed by the author and Broadbent for drying honeys and other\r\nviscous liquids.[13] In this process the sample of honey, molasses, or\r\nother viscous liquid is weighed in a flat dish, dissolved in eighty\r\nper cent alcohol, and then a weighed quantity of pure dry sand added,\r\nsufficient to fill the dish three-quarters full. The alcoholic solution\r\nof the viscous liquid is evenly distributed throughout the mass of sand\r\nby capillary attraction, and thus easily and rapidly dried when placed\r\non the bath.\r\n\r\nPumice stone, on account of its great porosity, is also an excellent\r\nmedium for the distribution of a viscous liquid in aiding the process\r\nof desiccation. The method has been worked out in great detail in\r\nthis laboratory by Carr and Sanborn,[14] and most excellent results\r\nobtained. Round aluminum dishes two centimeters high and from eight to\r\nten centimeters in diameter are conveniently used for this process.\r\nThe pumice stone is dried and broken into fragments the size of a pea\r\nbefore use.\r\n\r\n=27. General Principles of Drying Samples.=—It would be a needless\r\nwaste of space to go into further details of devices for desiccation. A\r\nsufficient number has been given to fully illustrate all the principles\r\ninvolved. In general, it may be said that drying in the open air at a\r\ntemperature not exceeding that of boiling water can be safely practiced\r\nwith the majority of samples. For instance, we have found practically\r\nno change in this laboratory in the composition of cereals dried in\r\nthe air and in an inert gas. The desiccation should in all cases be\r\naccomplished as speedily as possible. To this end the atmosphere in\r\ncontact with the sample should be dry and kept in motion. An oven\r\nsurrounded by boiling water and steam is to be preferred to one heated\r\nby air. Constancy of temperature is quite as important as its degree\r\nand this steadiness is most easily secured by steam at atmospheric\r\npressure. Where higher temperatures than 100° are desired the steam\r\nmust be under pressure, or the boiling-point of the water may be raised\r\nby adding salt or other soluble matters. A bath of paraffin or calcium\r\nchlorid may also be used or a sand or air-bath may be employed. The\r\nanalyst must not forget, however, that inorganic matters are prone to\r\nchange at temperatures above 100°, even in an inert atmosphere, and\r\nhigher temperatures must be used with extreme caution.\r\n\r\nDrying in partial vacuum and in a slowly changing atmosphere may\r\nbe practiced with all bodies and must be employed with some. The\r\nsimple form of apparatus already described will be found useful for\r\nthis purpose. At a vacuum of twenty inches or more, even unstable\r\norganic agricultural products are in little danger of oxidation. In\r\nthe introduction of a dry gas, therefore, air will be found as a\r\nrule entirely satisfactory. In the smaller form of vacuum apparatus\r\ndescribed, however, there is no objection to the employment of hydrogen\r\nor of carbon dioxid. The gas entering the apparatus should be dried\r\nby passing over calcium chlorid or by bubbling through sulfuric acid.\r\nIn this laboratory the vacuum is provided by an air-pump connected\r\nwith a large exhaust cylinder. This cylinder is connected by a system\r\nof pipes to all the working desks. The chief objection to this system\r\nis the unsteadiness of the pressure. When only a few are using the\r\nvacuum apparatus for filtering or other purposes the vacuum will stand\r\nat about twenty inches. When no one is using it the vacuum will rise\r\nto twenty-eight or twenty-nine inches. At other times, when in general\r\nuse, it may fall to fifteen inches. Where a constant vacuum is desired\r\nfor drying, therefore, it is advisable to connect the apparatus with a\r\nspecial aspirator which will give a pressure practically constant.\r\n\r\nThe dishes containing the sample should be low and flat, exposing as\r\nlarge a surface as possible. For viscous liquids it will be found\r\nadvisable to previously fill the dishes with pumice stone or other\r\ninert absorbent material to increase the surface exposed.\r\n\r\nThe special methods of drying milk, sirup, honeys, and like bodies,\r\nwill be described in the paragraphs devoted to these substances.\r\n\r\nIn drying agricultural products, not only water but all other matters\r\nvolatile at the temperature employed are expelled. It is only necessary\r\nto conduct the products of volatilization through sulfuric acid to\r\ndemonstrate the fact that organic bodies are given off. In the case\r\nmentioned the sulfuric acid will be speedily changed to a brown and\r\neven black color by these bodies. It is incontestable, however, that\r\nin most cases the essential oils and other volatile matters thus\r\nescaping are not large in quantity and could not appreciably affect\r\nthe percentage composition of the sample. In such cases the whole of\r\nthe loss on drying is entered in the note book as water. There are\r\nevidently many products, however, where a considerable percentage of\r\nthe volatile products is not water. The percentage of essential oils,\r\nwhich have a lower boiling-point than water, can be determined in a\r\nseparate sample and this deducted from the total loss on drying will\r\ngive the water.\r\n\r\nSimple as it seems, the determination of water in agricultural products\r\noften presents peculiar difficulties and taxes to the utmost the\r\npatience and skill of the analyst. Having set forth the substantial\r\nprinciples of the process and indicated its more important methods,\r\nthere is left for the worker in the laboratory the choice of processes\r\nalready described, or, in special cases, the device of new ones and\r\nadaption of old ones to meet the requirements of necessity.\r\n\r\n\r\nINCINERATION.\r\n\r\n=28. Determination of Ash.=—The principle to be kept in view in the\r\npreparation of the ash of agricultural products is to conduct the\r\nincineration at as low a temperature as possible to secure a complete\r\ncombustion. The danger of too high a temperature is two-fold. In the\r\nfirst place some of the mineral constituents constantly present in the\r\nash, notably, some of the salts of potassium and sodium are volatile\r\nat high temperatures and thus escape detection. In the second place,\r\nsome parts of the ash are rather easily fusible and in the melted state\r\nocclude particles of unburned organic matter, and thus protect them\r\nfrom complete oxidation. Both of these dangers are avoided, and an ash\r\npractically free of carbon obtained, by conducting the combustion at\r\nthe lowest possible temperature capable of securing the oxidation of\r\nthe carbonaceous matter.\r\n\r\n=29. Products Of Combustion.=—The most important product of combustion,\r\nfrom the present point of view, is the mineral residue obtained. The\r\norganic matter of the sample undergoes decomposition in various ways,\r\ndepending chiefly on its nature. Complex volatile compounds are formed\r\nfirst largely of an acid nature. The residual carbon is oxidized to\r\ncarbon dioxid and the hydrogen to water. The relative proportions\r\nof these bodies formed, in any given case, depend on the conditions\r\nof combustion. With a low temperature and a slow supply of oxygen,\r\nthe proportion of volatile organic compounds is increased. At a high\r\ntemperature, and in a surplus of oxygen, the proportions of water and\r\ncarbon dioxid are greater. At the present time, however, our attention\r\nis to be directed exclusively to the mineral residue; the organic\r\nproducts of combustion belonging to the domain of organic chemistry. As\r\nhas already been intimated, the ash of agricultural samples consists\r\nof the mineral matters derived from the tissues, together with any\r\naccidental mineral impurities which may be present, some unburned\r\ncarbon, and the sulfur, phosphorus, chlorin, nitrogen, etc., existing\r\npreviously in combination with the mineral bases. The organic sulfur\r\nand phosphorus may also undergo complete or partial oxidation during\r\nincineration and be found in the ash. Unless special precautions be\r\ntaken, however, a portion of the organic sulfur and phosphorus may\r\nescape as volatile compounds during the combustion.[15] The organic\r\nnitrogen is probably completely lost, at most, only traces of it being\r\noxidized during the combustion in such a way as to combine with a\r\nmineral base. The rare mineral elements that are taken up by plants\r\nwill also be found in the ash. Here the analyst would look for copper,\r\nboron, zinc, manganese, and the other elements which, when existing\r\nin the soil, are apt to be found in the tissues of the plants, not,\r\nperhaps, as organic or essential compounds, but as concomitants of the\r\nother mineral foods absorbed by growing vegetation. This fact is often\r\nof importance in toxicological and hygienic examinations of foods.\r\nFor instance, traces of copper or of boron in the ash of a prescribed\r\nfood would not be evidence of the use of copper or borax salts as\r\npreservatives unless it could be shown that the soil on which the food\r\nin question was grown was free of these bodies.\r\n\r\nThis fact manifestly applies only to those cases where mere traces\r\nof these rare bodies are in question. The presence of considerable\r\nquantities of them, enough to be inimical to health, could only be\r\nattributed to artificial means.\r\n\r\n=30. Purpose and Conduct of Incineration.=—In burning a sample of an\r\nagricultural product the analyst may desire to secure either a large\r\nsample of ash for analytical purposes as already described or to\r\ndetermine the actual percentage of ash. The first purpose is secured\r\nin many ways. In the preparation of ash for manurial purposes, for\r\ninstance, little care is exercised either to prevent volatilization of\r\nmineral matters or to avoid the occurrence of a considerable quantity\r\nof carbon in the sample. With this operation we have, at present,\r\nnothing whatever to do. In preparing a sample of ash for chemical\r\nanalysis it is important, where a sufficient quantity of the sample\r\ncan be obtained, to use as large a quantity of it as convenient.\r\nWhile it is true that very good results may be secured on very small\r\nsamples, it is always advisable to have a good supply of the material\r\nat hand. Since the materials burned have only from one to three per\r\ncent of ash, a kilogram of them will supply only from ten to thirty\r\ngrams. To supply all needful quantities of material and replace the\r\nlosses due to accident, whenever possible at least twenty grams of the\r\nash should be prepared. The combustion can be carried on in platinum\r\ndishes with all bodies free of metallic oxids capable of injuring the\r\nplatinum. Otherwise porcelain or clay dishes may be employed. As a\r\nrule the combustion is best conducted in a muffle at a low red heat.\r\nWith substances very rich in fusible ash, as for instance the cereals,\r\nit is advisable to first char them, extract the greater part of the\r\nash with water, and afterwards burn the residual carbon. The aqueous\r\nextract can then be added to the residue of combustion and evaporated\r\nto dryness at the temperature of boiling water. During the combustion\r\nthe contents of the dish should not be disturbed until the carbon is as\r\ncompletely burned out as possible. The naturally porous condition in\r\nwhich the mass is left during the burning is best suited to the entire\r\noxidation of the carbon. At the end however, it may become necessary to\r\nbring the superficial particles of unburned carbon into direct contact\r\nwith the bottom of the dish by stirring its contents. In most instances\r\nvery good results may be obtained by burning the ash in an open dish\r\nwithout the aid of a muffle. In this case a lamp should be used with\r\ndiffuse flame covering as evenly as possible the bottom of the dish and\r\nthus securing a uniform temperature. The carbon, when once in active\r\ncombustion, will as a rule be consumed, and an ash reasonably pure be\r\nobtained.\r\n\r\nThe second purpose held in view by the analyst is to determine the\r\nactual content of ash in a sample. For this purpose only a small\r\nquantity of the material should be used, generally from two to ten\r\ngrams. The combustion should be conducted in flat-bottomed, shallow\r\ndishes, and at a low temperature. In many cases the residue, after\r\ndetermining the moisture, can be at once subjected to incineration,\r\nand thus an important saving of time be secured. A muffle, with gentle\r\ndraft, will be found most useful for securing a white ash. The term,\r\nwhite ash, is sometimes a deceptive one. In samples containing iron or\r\nmanganese, the ash may be practically free of carbon and yet be highly\r\ncolored. The point at which the combustion is to be considered as\r\nfinished therefore should be at the time the carbon has disappeared\r\nrather than when no coloration exists. In general the methods of\r\nincineration are the same for all substances, but some cases may arise\r\nin which special processes must be employed. Some analysts prefer to\r\nsaturate the substance before incineration with sulfuric acid, securing\r\nthus a sulfated ash. This is practiced especially with molasses. In\r\nsuch cases the ash obtained is free of carbon dioxid and roughly the\r\ndifference in weight is compensated for by deducting one-tenth of\r\nthe weight of the ash when comparison is to be made with ordinary\r\ncarbonated ash. Naturally this process could not be used when sulfuric\r\nacid is to be determined in the product.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 17. COURTOUNE MUFFLE.]\r\n\r\n=31. German Ash Method.=—The method pursued at the Halle Station for\r\nsecuring the percentage of ash in a sample is as follows:[16] Five\r\ngrams of the air-dried sample are incinerated in a platinum dish and\r\nthe ash ignited until it has assumed a white, or at least a bright\r\ngray tint. As soon as combustible gases are emitted at the beginning\r\nof the incineration they are ignited and allowed to burn as long as\r\npossible. It is advisable to hasten the oxidation by stirring the mass\r\nwith a piece of platinum wire. If the ash should become agglomerated,\r\nas sometimes happens with rich food materials, it must be separated by\r\nattrition. The ash, when cooled on a desiccator, is to be weighed. When\r\ngreat exactness is required, it is advised, as set forth in a former\r\nparagraph, to first carbonize the mass and then extract the soluble\r\nash with hot water before completing the oxidation. When the latter is\r\ncomplete and the dish cooled the aqueous extract is added, evaporated\r\nto dryness and the incineration completed.\r\n\r\n=32. Courtonne’s Muffle.=—The ordinary arrangement of a muffle, as in\r\nassaying, may be conveniently used in incineration. A special muffle\r\narrangement has been prepared by Courtonne which not only permits of\r\nthe burning of a large number of samples at once, but also effects a\r\nconsiderable saving in gas. The muffle as shown in Fig. 17, is made in\r\ntwo stages, and the floor projects in front of the furnace, forming a\r\nconvenient hearth. The incineration is commenced on the upper stage,\r\nwhere the temperature is low, and finished on the lower one at a higher\r\nheat. The furnace is so arranged as to permit the flame of the burning\r\ngas to entirely surround the muffle. The draft and temperature within\r\nthe muffle are controlled by the fire-clay door shown resting on the\r\ntable.\r\n\r\n\r\nTREATMENT WITH SOLVENTS.\r\n\r\n=33. Object Of Treatment.=—The next step, in the analytical work, after\r\nsampling, drying, and incinerating, is the treatment of the sample with\r\nsolvents. The object of this work is to separate the material under\r\nexamination into distinct classes of bodies distinguished from each\r\nother by their solubilities. It is not the purpose of this section\r\nto describe the various bodies which may be separated in this way,\r\nespecially from vegetable products. For this description the reader may\r\nconsult the standard works on plant analysis.[17]\r\n\r\nThe chief object of a strictly agricultural examination of a field\r\nor garden product is to determine its food value. This purpose can\r\nbe accomplished without entering into a minute separation of nearly\r\nallied bodies. For example, in the case of carbohydrates it will be\r\nsufficient as a rule, to separate them into four classes. In the first\r\nclass will be found those soluble in water as the ordinary sugars. In\r\nthe second group will be found those which, while not easily soluble in\r\nwater, are readily rendered so by treatment with certain ferments or by\r\nhydrolysis with an acid. The starches are types of this class. In the\r\nthird place are found those bodies which resist the usual processes of\r\nhydrolysis either with an acid or alkali, and therefore remain in the\r\nresidue as fiber. Cellulose is a type of these bodies. In the fourth\r\nclass are included those bodies which on hydrolysis with an acid yield\r\nfurfurol on distillation, and therefore belong to the type containing\r\nfive atoms of carbon or some multiple thereof in their molecule. For\r\nordinary agricultural purpose the separation is not even as complete as\r\nis represented above.\r\n\r\nWhat is true of the carbohydrates applies equally well to the fats and\r\nto other groups. Especially in the analysis of cereals and of cattle\r\nfoods, the treatment with solvents is confined to the use in successive\r\norder of ether or petroleum, alcohol, dilute acids, and alkalies, the\r\nlatter at a boiling temperature. The general method of treatment with\r\nthese solvents will be the subject of the following paragraphs.\r\n\r\n=34. Extraction of the Fats and Oils.=—Two solvents are in general use\r\nfor the extraction of fats and oils; _viz._, ethylic ether and a light\r\npetroleum. The former is the more common reagent. Before use it should\r\nbe made as pure as possible by washing first with water, afterwards\r\nremoving the water by lime or calcium chlorid, and then completing\r\nthe drying by treatment with metallic sodium. The petroleum spirit\r\nused should be purified by several fractional distillations until it\r\nhas nearly a constant boiling-point of from 45° to 50°. The detailed\r\nmethods of preparing these reagents will be given in another place. For\r\nrigid scientific determinations the petroleum is to be preferred to the\r\nether. It is equally as good a solvent for fats and oils and is almost\r\ninert in respect to other vegetable constituents. Ether, on the other\r\nhand, dissolves chlorophyll and its partial oxidation products, resins,\r\nalkaloids and the like. The extract obtained by ether is therefore less\r\nlikely to be a pure fat than that secured by petroleum. For purposes of\r\ncomparison, however, the ether should be employed, inasmuch as it has\r\nbeen used almost exclusively in analytical operations in the past.\r\n\r\n=35. Methods Of Extraction.=—The simplest method for accomplishing\r\nthe extraction of fat from a sample consists in treating it with\r\nsuccessive portions of the solvent in an open dish or a closed flask.\r\nThis process is actually employed in some analytical operations, as,\r\nfor instance, in the determination of fat in milk. Experience has\r\nshown, however, that a portion of the substance soluble, for instance,\r\nin ether, passes very slowly into solution, so that a treatment such as\r\nthat just described would have to be long continued to secure maximum\r\nresults. The quantity of solvent required would thus become very large\r\nand in the case of ether would entail a great expense. For the greater\r\nnumber of analytical operations, therefore, some device is employed for\r\nusing the same solvent continually. The methods of extraction therefore\r\nfall into two general classes; _viz._, extraction by digestion and\r\nextraction by percolation. This classification holds good also for\r\nother solvents besides ether and petroleum. In general, the principles\r\nand practice of extraction described for ether may serve equally well\r\nfor alcohol, acetone and other common solvents.\r\n\r\n=36. Extraction by Digestion.=—In the use of ether or petroleum the\r\nsample is covered with an excess of the solvent and allowed to remain\r\nfor some time in contact therewith. The soluble portions of the\r\nsample diffuse into the reagent. The speed of diffusion is promoted\r\nby stirring the mixtures. The operation may be conducted in an open\r\ndish or a flask. Inasmuch as the residue is, as a rule, to be dried\r\nand weighed, an open dish is to be preferred. To avoid loss of reagent\r\nand to prevent filling a working room with very dangerous gases, the\r\ntemperature of digestion should be kept below the boiling-point of the\r\nsolvent. The greater part of the soluble matter will be extracted with\r\nthree or four successive applications of the reagent, but, as intimated\r\nabove, the last portions of the soluble material are extracted with\r\ndifficulty by this process. In pouring off the solvent care must be\r\nexercised to avoid loss of particles of the sample suspended therein.\r\nTo this end it is best to pour the solvent through a filter. For the\r\nextraction of large quantities of material for the purpose of securing\r\nthe extract for future examination, or simply to remove it, the\r\ndigestion process is usually employed. This excess of solvent required\r\nis easily recovered by subsequent distillation and used again. The\r\nmethod is rarely used for the quantitive estimation of the extract,\r\nthe process of continuous percolation being more convenient and more\r\nexact.\r\n\r\n=37. Extraction by Percolation.=—In this method the solvent employed\r\nis poured on the top of the material to be extracted and allowed to\r\npass through it usually by gravitation alone, sometimes with the help\r\nof a filter-pump. The principle of the process is essentially that of\r\nwashing precipitates.\r\n\r\nTwo distinct forms of apparatus are in use for this process. In\r\nthe first kind the solvent is poured over the material and after\r\npercolation is secured by distillation in another apparatus. In the\r\nsecond kind the solvent is secured after percolation in a flask where\r\nit is at once subjected to distillation. The vapors of the solvent\r\nare conducted by appropriate means to a condenser placed above the\r\nsample. After condensation the solvent is returned to the upper part of\r\nthe sample. The percolation thus becomes continuous and a very small\r\nquantity of the solvent may thus be made to extract a comparatively\r\nlarge amount of material. This process is particularly applicable\r\nto the quantitive determination of the extract. After distillation\r\nand drying the latter may be weighed in the flask in which it was\r\nreceived or the sample may be dried and weighed in the vessel in which\r\nit is held both before and after extraction. One great advantage of\r\nthe continuous extraction method lies in the fact that when it is\r\nonce properly started it goes on without further attention from the\r\nanalyst save an occasional examination of the flow of water through\r\nthe condenser and of the rate of the distillation. For this reason the\r\nprocess may be continued for many hours without any notable loss of\r\ntime. The vapor of the solvent in passing to the condenser may pass\r\nthrough a tube out of contact with the material to be extracted or it\r\nmay pass directly around the tube holding the sample. In the former\r\ncase the advantage is secured of conducting the extraction at a higher\r\ntemperature, but there is danger of boiling the solvent in contact with\r\nthe material and thus permitting the loss of a portion of the sample.\r\n\r\n=38. Apparatus Used for Extractions.=—For extraction by digestion, as\r\nhas already been said, an open dish may be used. When large quantities\r\nof material are under treatment, heavy flasks, holding from five to\r\nten liters, will be found convenient. In these cases a condenser can\r\nbe attached to the flask and the extraction conducted at the boiling\r\ntemperature of the solvent. During the process of extraction it is\r\nadvisable to shake the flask frequently. By proceeding in this way the\r\ngreater part of the solvent matter will be removed after three or four\r\nsuccessive treatments.\r\n\r\nIn extraction by percolation various forms of apparatus are employed.\r\nThe ordinary percolators of the manufacturing pharmacist may be used\r\nfor the larger operations, while the more elaborate forms of continuous\r\nextractors will be found most convenient for quantitive work. In each\r\ncase the analyst must choose that process and form of apparatus best\r\nsuited to the purpose in view. In the next paragraphs will be described\r\nsome of the more common forms of apparatus in use.\r\n\r\n=39. Knorr’s Extraction Apparatus.=—The apparatus which has been\r\nchiefly used in this laboratory for the past few years is shown in\r\nthe accompanying figure.[18] The principle of the construction of the\r\napparatus lies in the complete suppression of stoppers and in sealing\r\nthe only joint of the device with mercury.\r\n\r\nThe construction and operation of the apparatus will be understood by a\r\nbrief description of its parts.\r\n\r\nA is the flask containing the solvent, W a steam bath made by cutting\r\noff the top of a bottle, inverting it and conducting the steam into one\r\nof the tubes shown in the stopper while the condensed water runs out of\r\nthe other. The top of the bath is covered with a number of concentric\r\ncopper rings, so that the opening may be made of any desirable size. B\r\nrepresents the condenser, which is a long glass tube on which a number\r\nof bulbs has been blown, and which is attached to the hood for holding\r\nthe material to be extracted, as represented at Bʹ, making a solid\r\nglass union. Before joining the tube at Bʹ the rubber stopper which is\r\nto hold it into the outside condenser of B is slipped on, or the rubber\r\nstopper may be cut into its center and slipped over the tube after the\r\nunion is made. In case alcohol is to be used for the solvent, requiring\r\na higher temperature, the flask holding the solvent is placed entirely\r\nwithin the steam-bath, as represented at Aʹ.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 18. KNORR’S EXTRACTION APPARATUS.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 19. EXTRACTION FLASK.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 20. EXTRACTION TUBE.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 21. EXTRACTION SIPHON TUBE.]\r\n\r\nA more detailed description of the different parts of the apparatus\r\ncan be seen by consulting Figs. 19, 20, and 21. In A, Fig. 19, is\r\nrepresented a section of the flask which holds the solvent, showing\r\nhow the sides of the hood containing the matters to be extracted pass\r\nover the neck of the flask, and showing at S a small siphon inserted\r\nin the space between the neck of the flask and the walls of the hood\r\nfor the purpose of removing any solvent that may accumulate in this\r\nspace. A view of the flask itself is shown at Aʹ. It is made by taking\r\nan ordinary flask, softening it about the neck and pressing the neck\r\nin so as to form a cup, as indicated at Aʹ, to hold the mercury which\r\nseals the union of the flask with the condenser. The flask is held in\r\nposition by passing a rubber band below it, which is attached to two\r\nglass nipples, _b_, blown onto the containing vessel, as shown in Fig.\r\n18. The material to be extracted may be contained in an ordinary tube,\r\nas shown in Fig. 20, which may be made from a test tube drawn out, as\r\nindicated in the figure, having a perforated platinum disk sealed in\r\nat D. The containing tube rests upon the edges of the flask containing\r\nthe solvent by means of nipples shown at _t_. If a siphon tube is to\r\nbe used, one of the most convenient forms is shown in Fig. 21, in\r\nwhich the siphon lies entirely within the extracting tube, thus being\r\nprotected from breakage. By means of this apparatus the extractions\r\ncan be carried on with a very small quantity of solvent, there being\r\nscarcely any leakage, even with the most volatile solvents, such as\r\nether and petroleum. The apparatus is always ready for use, no corks\r\nare to be extracted, and no ground glass joints to be fitted.\r\n\r\n=40. Soxhlet’s Extraction Apparatus.=—A form of continuous extraction\r\napparatus has been proposed by Soxhlet which permits the passage of\r\nthe vapors of the solvent into the condenser by a separate tube and\r\nthe return of the condensed solvent after having stood in contact\r\nwith the sample, to the evaporating flask by a siphon. The advantage\r\nof this process lies in freeing the sample entirely from the rise of\r\ntemperature due to contact with the vapors of the solvent, and in the\r\nsecond place in the complete saturation of the sample with the solvent\r\nbefore siphoning. The sample is conveniently held in a cylinder of\r\nextracted filter-paper open above and closed below. This is placed\r\nin the large tube between the evaporating flask and the condenser.\r\nThe sample should not fill the paper holder, and if disposed to float\r\nin the solvent, should be held down with a plug of asbestos fiber\r\nor of glass wool. The extract may be transferred, by dissolving in\r\nthe solvent, from the flask to a drying dish, or it may be dried and\r\nweighed in the flask where first received.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 22. SOXHLET EXTRACTION APPARATUS.]\r\n\r\nThere are many forms of apparatus of this kind, one of which is shown\r\nin Fig. 22, but a more extended description of them is not necessary.\r\nThe disadvantages of this process as compared with Knorr’s, are quite\r\napparent. The connections with the evaporating flask and condenser are\r\nmade with cork stoppers, which must be previously thoroughly extracted\r\nwith ether and alcohol. These corks soon become dry and hard and\r\ndifficult to use. The joints are likely to leak, and grave dangers\r\nof explosion arise from the vapors of the solvents escaping into the\r\nworking room. Moreover, it is an advantage to have the sample warmed\r\nby the vapors of the solvent during the progress of the extraction,\r\nprovided the liquid in direct contact with the sample does not boil\r\nwith sufficient vigor to cause loss.\r\n\r\nThe use of extraction apparatus with ground glass joints is also\r\nunsatisfactory. By reason of unequal expansion and contraction these\r\njoints often are not tight. They are also liable to break and thus\r\nbring danger and loss of time.\r\n\r\n=41. Compact Extraction Apparatus.=—In order to bring the extraction\r\napparatus into a more compact form, the following described device has\r\nbeen successfully used in this laboratory.[19] The condenser employed\r\nis made of metal and is found entirely within the tube holding the\r\nsolvent.\r\n\r\nThis form of condenser is shown in Fig. 23, in which the tube E serves\r\nto introduce the cold water to the bottom of the condensing device.\r\nThe tube D serves to carry away the waste water. The tube F serves\r\nfor the introduction of the solvent by means of a small funnel. When\r\nthe solvent is introduced and has boiled for a short time, the tube\r\nF should be closed. In each of the double conical sections of the\r\ncondenser a circular disk B is found, which causes the water flowing\r\nfrom A upward to pass against the metallic surfaces of the condenser.\r\n\r\nA section of the double conical condenser is shown in the upper right\r\nhand corner. It is provided with two small hooks _hh_, soldered on the\r\nlower surface, by means of which the crucible G can be hung with a\r\nplatinum wire. The condenser is best made smooth and circular in form.\r\n\r\nThe crucible G, which holds the material to be extracted, can be made\r\nof platinum, but for sake of economy also of porcelain. The bottom\r\nof the porcelain crucible is left open excepting a small shelf, as\r\nindicated, which supports a perforated disk of platinum on which an\r\nasbestos film is placed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 23. COMPACT CONDENSING APPARATUS.]\r\n\r\nThe whole apparatus is of such size as to be easily contained in the\r\nlarge test-tube T.\r\n\r\nThe mouth of the test-tube is ground so as to fit as smoothly as\r\npossible to the ground-brass plate of the metallic condenser P.\r\n\r\nIn case it is desired to weigh the extract it may be done directly by\r\nweighing it in the test-tube T after drying in the usual way at the\r\nend of the extraction; or a glass flask H, made to fit freely into the\r\ntest-tube, may be used, in which case a little mercury is poured into\r\nthe bottom of the tube to seal the space between H and T. To prevent\r\nspirting of the substance in H, or projecting any of the extracted\r\nmaterial without or against the bottom of the crucible G, the funnel\r\nrepresented by the dotted lines in the right hand section may be used.\r\n\r\nHeat may be applied to the test-tube either by hot water, or steam, or\r\nby a bunsen, which permits of the flame being turned down to minimum\r\nproportions without danger of burning back. When the test-tube alone\r\nis used it is advisable to first put into it some fragments of pumice\r\nstone, particles of platinum foil, or a spoonful of shot, to prevent\r\nbumping of the liquid when the lamp is used as the source of heat.\r\n\r\nAny air which the apparatus contains is pushed out through F when the\r\nboiling begins, the tube F not being closed until the vapor of the\r\nliquid has reached its maximum height. With cold water in the condenser\r\nthe vapor of ether very rarely reaches above the lower compartment and\r\nthe vapor of alcohol rarely above the second.\r\n\r\nWhen the plate P is accurately turned so as to fit the ground surface\r\nof the mouth of T, it is found that ten cubic centimeters of anhydrous\r\nether or alcohol are sufficient to make a complete extraction, and\r\nthere is not much loss of solvent in six hours. The thickness of the\r\nasbestos film in G, or its fineness, is so adjusted as to prevent too\r\nrapid filtration so that the solvent may just cover the material to\r\nbe extracted, or, after the material is placed in a crucible, a plug\r\nof extracted glass wool may be placed above it for the purpose of\r\ndistributing the solvent evenly over the surface of the material to be\r\nextracted and of preventing the escape of fine particles.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 24. IMPROVED COMPACT EXTRACTION APPARATUS.]\r\n\r\nIn very warm weather the apparatus may be arranged as shown in figure\r\n24. The bath for holding the extraction tubes is made in two parts,\r\nK and Kʹ. The bath K has a false bottom shown in the dotted line O,\r\nperforated to receive the ends of the extraction tubes and which holds\r\nthem in place and prevents them from touching the true bottom, where\r\nthey might be unequally heated by the lamp. The upper bath Kʹ has a\r\nperforated bottom, partly closed with rubber-cloth diaphragms Gʹ Nʹ Hʹ.\r\nThe extraction tubes passing through this bath, water-tight, permit\r\nbroken ice or ice-water to be held about their tops, and thus secure\r\na complete condensation of the vapors of the solvent which in warm\r\nweather might escape the metal condenser. In practice care must be\r\ntaken to avoid enveloping too much of the upper part of the extraction\r\ntube with the ice-water, otherwise the vapors of the solvent will be\r\nchiefly condensed on the sides of the extraction tube and will not be\r\nreturned through the sample. It is not often that the upper bath is\r\nneeded, and then only with ether, never with alcohol. This apparatus\r\nhas proved especially useful with alcohol, using, as suggested,\r\nglycerol in the bath. The details of its further construction and\r\narrangement are shown in the figure. The extraction tubes are most\r\nconveniently arranged in a battery of four, one current of cold water\r\npassing in at A and out at B, serving for all. The bath is supported\r\non legs long enough to allow the lamp plenty of room. The details of\r\nthe condenser M are shown in Bʹ, Aʹ, T, Fʹ, and Lʹ. Instead of a gooch\r\nLʹ for holding the sample a glass tube R, with a perforated platinum\r\ndisk Q, may be used. The water line in the bath is shown by W. This\r\napparatus may be made very cheaply and without greatly impairing its\r\nefficiency by using a plain concentric condenser and leaving off the\r\nupper bath Kʹ.\r\n\r\n=42. Solvents Employed.=—It has already been intimated that the chief\r\nsolvents employed in the extraction of agricultural samples are ether\r\nor petroleum and aqueous alcohol. The ether used should be free of\r\nalcohol and water, the petroleum should be subjected to fractional\r\ndistillation to free it of the parts of very high and very low boiling\r\npoints, and the alcohol as a rule should contain about twenty per cent\r\nof water.\r\n\r\nThere are many instances, however, where other solvents should be used.\r\nThe use of aqueous alcohol is sometimes preceded by that of alcohol of\r\ngreater strength or practically free of water. For the extraction of\r\nsoluble carbohydrates (sugars) cold or tepid water is employed, the\r\ntemperature of which is not allowed to rise high enough to act upon\r\nstarch granules. For the solution of the starch itself an acid solvent\r\nis used at a boiling temperature, whereby the starch molecules undergo\r\nhydrolysis and form dextrin or soluble sugars (maltose, dextrose). By\r\nthis process also the carbohydrates, whose molecules contain five, or\r\nsome multiple thereof, atoms of carbon form soluble sugars of which\r\nxylose and arabinose are types. The solvent action of acids followed\r\nby treatment with dilute alkalies at a boiling temperature, completes\r\npractically the solution of all the carbohydrate bodies, save cellulose\r\nand nearly related compounds. The starch carbohydrates are further\r\ndissolved by the action of certain ferments such as diastase.\r\n\r\nDilute solutions of mineral salts exert a specific solvent action on\r\ncertain nitrogenous compounds and serve to help separate the albuminoid\r\nbodies into definite groups.\r\n\r\nUnder the proper headings the uses of these principal solvents will be\r\ndescribed, but a complete discussion of their action, especially on\r\nsamples of a vegetable origin, should be looked for in works on plant\r\nanalysis.[20]\r\n\r\nThe application of acids and alkalies for the extraction of\r\ncarbohydrates, insoluble in water and alcohol, will be described,\r\nin the paragraphs devoted to the analysis of fodders and cereals.\r\nThe extraction of these matters, made soluble by ferments, will be\r\ndiscussed in the pages devoted to starch and artificial digestion.\r\nIt is thus seen that the general preliminary treatment of a sample\r\npreparatory to specific methods of examination is confined to drying,\r\nextraction with ether and alcohol, and incineration.\r\n\r\n=43. Recovery of the Solvent.=—In using such solvents as ether,\r\nchloroform, and others of high value, it is desirable often to recover\r\nthe solvent. Various forms of apparatus are employed for this purpose,\r\narranged in such a way as both to secure the solvent and to leave the\r\nresidue in an accessible condition, or in a form suited to weighing\r\nin quantitive work. When the extractions are made according to the\r\nimproved method of Knorr, the flask containing the extract may be at\r\nonce connected with the apparatus shown in figure 25.[21] A represents\r\nthe flask containing the solvent to be recovered, W the steam-bath,\r\nB the condenser sealed by mercury, M and R the flask receiving the\r\nproducts of condensation. It will be found economical to save ether,\r\nalcohol, and chloroform even when only a few cubic centimeters remain\r\nafter the extraction is complete. In the figure the neck of the flask\r\nA is represented as narrower than it really is. The open end of the\r\nconnecting tube, which is sealed on A by mercury, should be the same\r\nsize as the tube connecting with the condenser in the extraction\r\napparatus.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 25.—KNORR’S APPARATUS FOR RECEIVING SOLVENTS.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 26. APPARATUS FOR RECOVERING SOLVENTS FROM OPEN\r\nDISHES.]\r\n\r\nIt often happens that materials which are dissolved by the ordinary\r\nsolvents in use are to be collected in open dishes in order that\r\ntheir properties may be studied. At the same time large quantities\r\nof solvents must be used, and it is desirable to have some method of\r\nrecovering them. The device shown in Fig. 26 has been found to work\r\nexcellently well for this purpose.[22] It consists of a steam-bath, W,\r\nand a bottle, B, with the bottom cut off, resting on an iron dish, P,\r\ncontaining a small quantity of mercury, enough to seal the bottom of\r\nthe bottle. The dish containing the solvent is placed on the mercury,\r\nand the bottle placed down over it, forming a tight joint. On the\r\napplication of steam the solvent escapes into the condenser, C, and is\r\ncollected as a liquid in the flask A. In very volatile solvents the\r\nflask A may be surrounded with ice, or ice-cold water passed through\r\nthe condenser. When an additional quantity of the solvent is to be\r\nadded to the dish for the purpose of evaporating it is poured into the\r\nfunnel F, and the stopcock H opened, which allows the material to run\r\ninto the dish in B without removing the bottle. In this way many liters\r\nof the solvent may be evaporated in any one dish, and the total amount\r\nof extract obtained together. At the last the bottle B is removed, and\r\nthe extract which is found in the dish is ready for further operations.\r\n\r\n\r\nAUTHORITIES CITED IN PART FIRST.\r\n\r\n[1] Sidersky: Traité d’Analyse des Matières Sucrées, p. 311.\r\n\r\n[2] Die Agricultur-Chemische Versuchs-Station, Halle a/S., S. 34.

Introduction.=—Carbohydrates, of which sugars and starches are\r\nthe chief representatives, form the great mass of the results of\r\nvegetable metabolism. The first functions of the chlorophyll cells of\r\nthe young plant are the condensation of carbon dioxid and water. The\r\nsimplest form of the condensation is formaldehyd, CH₂O. There is no\r\nconvincing evidence, however, that this is the product resulting from\r\nthe functional activity of the chlorophyll cells. The first evidence\r\nof the condensation is found in more complex molecules; _viz._, those\r\nhaving six atoms of carbon. It is not the purpose of this work to\r\ndiscuss the physiology of this process, but the interested student can\r\neasily find access to the literature of the subject.[23] When a sample\r\nof a vegetable nature reaches the analyst he finds by far the largest\r\npart of its substance composed of these products of condensation of the\r\ncarbon dioxid and water. The sugars, starches, pentosans, lignoses, and\r\ncelluloses all have this common origin. Of many air-dried plants these\r\nbodies form more than eighty per cent.\r\n\r\nIn green plants the sugars exist chiefly in the sap. In plants cut\r\ngreen and quickly dried by artificial means the sugars are found\r\nin a solid state. They also exist in the solid state naturally in\r\ncertain sacchariferous seeds. Many sugar-bearing plants when allowed\r\nto dry spontaneously lose all or the greater part of their sugar by\r\nfermentation. This is true of sugar cane, sorghum, maize stalks, and\r\nthe like. The starches are found deposited chiefly in tubers, roots or\r\nseeds. In the potato the starch is in the tuber, in cassava the tuber\r\nholding the starch is also a root, in maize, rice and other cereals the\r\nstarch is in the seeds. The wood-fibers; _viz._, pentosans, lignose,\r\ncellulose, etc., form the framework and support of the plant structure.\r\nOf all these carbohydrate bodies the most important as foods are the\r\nsugars and starches, but a certain degree of digestibility cannot be\r\ndenied to other carbohydrate bodies with the possible exception of\r\npure cellulose. In the following paragraphs the general principles of\r\ndetermining the sugars and starches will be given and afterwards the\r\nspecial processes of extracting these bodies from vegetable substances\r\npreparatory to quantitive determination.\r\n\r\n=45. Nomenclature.=—In speaking of sugars it has been thought best\r\nto retain for the present the old nomenclature in order to avoid\r\nconfusion. The terms dextrose, levulose, sucrose, etc., will therefore\r\nbe given their commonly accepted significations.\r\n\r\nA more scientific nomenclature has recently been proposed by Fischer,\r\nin which glucose is used as the equivalent of dextrose and fructose\r\nas the proper name for levulose. All sugars are further classified\r\nby Fischer into groups according to the number of carbon atoms found\r\nin the molecule. We have thus trioses, tetroses, pentoses, hexoses,\r\netc. Such a sugar as sucrose is called hexobiose by reason of the fact\r\nthat it appears to be formed of two molecules of hexose sugars. For a\r\nsimilar reason raffinose would belong to the hexotriose group.[24]\r\n\r\nAgain, the two great classes of sugars as determined by the structure\r\nof the molecule are termed aldoses and ketoses according to their\r\nrelationship to the aldehyd or ketone bodies.\r\n\r\nSince sugars may be optically twinned, that is composed of equal\r\nmolecules of right and left-handed polarizing matter it may happen that\r\napparently the same body may deflect the plane of polarization to the\r\nright, to the left, or show perfect neutrality.\r\n\r\nNatural sugars, as a rule, are optically active, but synthetic sugars\r\nbeing optically twinned are apt to be neutral to polarized light.\r\n\r\nTo designate the original optical properties of the body therefore the\r\nsymbols _d_, _l_, and _i_, meaning dextrogyratory, levogyratory, and\r\ninactive, respectively, are prefixed to the name. Thus we may have _d_,\r\n_l_, or _i_ glucose, _d_, _l_, or _i_ fructose, and so on.\r\n\r\nThe sugars that are of interest here belong altogether to the pentose\r\nand hexose groups; _viz._, C₅H₁₀O₅ and C₆H₁₂O₆, respectively. Of the\r\nhexobioses, sucrose, maltose, and lactose are the most important,\r\nand of the hexotrioses, raffinose. In this manual, unless otherwise\r\nstated, the term dextrose corresponds to _d_ glucose, and levulose to\r\n_d_ fructose. In this connection, however, it should be noted that the\r\nlevulose of nature, or that which is formed by the hydrolysis of inulin\r\nor sucrose is not identical in its optical properties with the _l_\r\nfructose of Fischer.\r\n\r\n=46. Preparation of Pure Sugar.=—In using the polariscope or in testing\r\nsolutions for the chemical analysis of samples, the analyst will be\r\nrequired to keep always on hand some pure sugar. Several methods of\r\npreparing pure sugar have been proposed. The finest granulated sugar\r\nof commerce is almost pure. In securing samples for examination those\r\nshould be selected which have had a minimum treatment with bluing in\r\nmanufacture. The best quality of granulated sugar when pulverized,\r\nwashed with ninety-five per cent and then with absolute alcohol and\r\ndried over sulfuric acid at a temperature not exceeding 50° will be\r\nfound nearly pure. Such a sugar will, as a rule, not contain more\r\nthan one-tenth per cent of impurities, and can be safely used for all\r\nanalytical purposes. It is assumed in the above that the granulated\r\nsugar is made from sugar cane.\r\n\r\nGranulated beet sugars may contain raffinose and so may show a\r\npolarization in excess of 100. This sugar may be purified by dissolving\r\nseventy parts by weight in thirty parts of water. The sugar is\r\nprecipitated by adding slowly an equal volume of ninety-six per cent\r\nalcohol with constant stirring, the temperature of the mixture being\r\nkept at 60°. While still warm the supernatant liquor is decanted\r\nand the precipitated sugar washed by decantation several times with\r\nstrong warm alcohol. The sugar, on a filter, is finally washed with\r\nabsolute alcohol and dried in a thin layer over sulfuric acid at from\r\n35° to 40°. By this process any raffinose which the sugar may have\r\ncontained is completely removed by the warm alcohol. Since beet sugar\r\nis gradually coming into use in this country it is safer to follow the\r\nabove method with all samples.[25] In former times it was customary\r\nto prepare pure sugar from the whitest crystals of rock candy. These\r\ncrystals are powdered, dissolved in water, filtered, precipitated with\r\nalcohol, washed and dried in the manner described above.\r\n\r\n=47. Classification of Methods.=—In the quantitive determination of\r\npure sugar the various processes employed may all be grouped into three\r\nclasses. In the first class are included all those which deduce the\r\npercentage of sugar present from the specific gravity of its aqueous\r\nsolution. The accuracy of this process depends on the purity of the\r\nmaterial, the proper control of the temperature, and the reliability\r\nof the instruments employed. The results are obtained either directly\r\nfrom the scale of the instruments employed or are calculated from the\r\narbitrary or specific gravity numbers observed. It is evident that\r\nany impurity in the solution would serve to introduce an error of a\r\nmagnitude depending on the percentage of impurity and the deviation of\r\nthe density from that of sugar. The different classes of sugars, having\r\ndifferent densities in solution, give also different readings on the\r\ninstruments employed. It is evident, therefore, that a series of tables\r\nof percentages corresponding to the specific gravities of the solutions\r\nof different sugars would be necessary for exact work. Practically,\r\nhowever, the sugar which is most abundant, _viz._, sucrose, may be\r\ntaken as a representative of the others and for rapid control work the\r\ndensimetric method is highly useful.\r\n\r\nIn the second class of methods are grouped all those processes which\r\ndepend upon the property of sugar solutions to rotate the plane of\r\npolarized light. Natural sugars all have this property and if their\r\nsolutions be found neutral to polarized light it is because they\r\ncontain sugars of opposite polarizing powers of equal intensity. Some\r\nsugars turn the polarized plane to the right and others to the left,\r\nand the degree of rotation in each case depends, at equal temperatures\r\nand densities of the solutions, on the percentages of sugars present.\r\nIn order that the optical examination of a sugar may give correct\r\nresults the solution must be of a known density and free of other\r\nbodies capable of affecting the plane of polarized light. In the\r\nfollowing paragraphs an attempt will be made to give in sufficient\r\ndetail the methods of practice of these different processes in so\r\nfar as they are of interest to the agricultural analyst. The number\r\nof variations, however, in these processes is so great as to make\r\nthe attempt to fully discuss them here impracticable. The searcher\r\nfor additional details should consult the standard works on sugar\r\nanalysis.[26]\r\n\r\nIn the third class of methods are included those which are of a\r\nchemical nature based either on the reducing power which sugar\r\nsolutions exercise on certain metallic salts, upon the formation of\r\ncertain crystalline and insoluble compounds with other bodies or\r\nupon fermentation. Under proper conditions solutions of sugar reduce\r\nsolutions of certain metallic salts, throwing out either the metal\r\nitself or a low oxid thereof. In alkaline solutions of mercury and\r\ncopper, sugars exercise a reducing action, throwing out in the one case\r\nmetallic mercury and in the other cuprous oxid. With phenylhydrazin,\r\nsugars form definite crystalline compounds, quite insoluble, which\r\ncan be collected, dried and weighed. There is a large number of other\r\nchemical reactions with sugars such as their union with the earthy\r\nbases, color reactions with alkalies, oxidation products with acids,\r\nand so on, which are of great use qualitively and in technological\r\nprocesses, but these are of little value in quantitive determinations.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DETERMINATION OF THE PERCENTAGE OF SUGAR BY THE DENSITY OF ITS\r\nSOLUTION.\r\n\r\n=48. Principles of the Method.=—This method of analysis is applied\r\nalmost exclusively to the examination of one kind of sugar, _viz._, the\r\ncommon sugar of commerce. This sugar is derived chiefly from sugar cane\r\nand sugar beets and is known chemically as sucrose or saccharose. The\r\nmethod is accurate only when applied to solutions of pure sucrose which\r\ncontain no other bodies. It is evident however, that other bodies in\r\nsolution can be determined by the same process, so that the principle\r\nof the method is broadly applicable to the analyses of any body\r\nwhatever in a liquid state or in solution. Gases, liquids and solids,\r\nin solution, can all be determined by densimetric methods.\r\n\r\nBroadly stated the principle of the method consists in determining the\r\nspecific gravity of the liquid or solution, and thereafter taking the\r\npercentage of the body in solution from the corresponding specific\r\ngravity in a table. These tables are carefully prepared by gravimetric\r\ndeterminations of the bodies in solution of known densities, varying by\r\nsmall amounts and calculation of the percentages for the intervening\r\nincrements or decrements of density. This tabulation is accomplished at\r\ndefinite temperatures and the process of analysis secured thereby is\r\nrapid and accurate, with pure or nearly pure solutions.\r\n\r\n=49. Determination of Density.=—While not strictly correct from a\r\nphysical point of view, the terms density and specific gravity are here\r\nused synonymously and refer to a direct comparison of the weights of\r\nequal volumes of pure water and of the solution in question, at the\r\ntemperature named. When not otherwise stated, the temperature of the\r\nsolution is assumed to be 15°.5.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 27. COMMON FORMS OF PYKNOMETERS.]\r\n\r\nThe simplest method of determining the density of a solution is to\r\nget the weight of a definite volume thereof. This is conveniently\r\naccomplished by the use of a pyknometer. A pyknometer is any vessel\r\ncapable of holding a definite volume of a liquid in a form suited\r\nto weighing. It may be a simple flask with a narrow neck distinctly\r\nmarked, or a flask with a ground perforated stopper, which, when\r\ninserted, secures always the same volume of liquid contents. A very\r\ncommon form of pyknometer is one in which the central stopper carries a\r\nthermometer and the constancy of volume is secured by a side tubulure\r\nof very small or even capillary dimensions, which is closed by a ground\r\nglass cap.\r\n\r\nThe apparatus may not even be of flask form, but assume a quite\r\ndifferent shape as in Sprengel’s tube. Pyknometers are often made to\r\nhold an even number of cubic centimeters, but the only advantage of\r\nthis is in the ease of calculation which it secures. As a rule, it\r\nwill be found necessary to calibrate even these, and then the apparent\r\nadvantage will be easily lost. A flask which is graduated to hold fifty\r\ncubic centimeters, may, in a few years, change its volume at least\r\nslightly, due to molecular changes in the glass. Some of the different\r\nforms of pyknometers are shown in the accompanying figures.\r\n\r\nIn use the pyknometer should be filled with pure water of the desired\r\ntemperature and weighed. From the total weight the tare of the flask\r\nand stopper, weighed clean and dry, is to be deducted. The remainder\r\nis the weight of the volume of water of the temperature noted, which\r\nthe pyknometer holds. The weight of the solution under examination is\r\ntaken in the same way and at the same temperature, and thus a direct\r\ncomparison between the two liquids is secured.\r\n\r\n    _Example._—Let the weight of the pyknometer be    15.2985 grams.\r\n      and its weight with pure water at 15°.5 be      26.9327   ”\r\n      Then the weight of water is                     11.6342   ”\r\n      The weight filled with the sugar solution is    28.3263   ”\r\n      Then the weight of the sugar solution is        13.0278   ”\r\n\r\nThe specific gravity of the sugar solution is therefore, 13.0278 ÷\r\n11.6342 = 1.1198.\r\n\r\nFor strictly accurate results the weight must be corrected for the\r\nvolume of air displaced, or in other words, be reduced to weights in\r\nvacuo. This however is unnecessary for the ordinary operations of\r\nagricultural analysis.\r\n\r\nIf the volume of the pyknometer be desired, it can be calculated from\r\nthe weight of pure water which it holds, one cubic centimeter of pure\r\nwater weighing one gram at 4°.\r\n\r\nThe weights of one cubic centimeter of water at each degree of\r\ntemperature from 1° to 40°, are given in the following table:\r\n\r\n    TABLE SHOWING WEIGHTS OF ONE CUBIC CENTIMETER OF\r\n    PURE WATER AT TEMPERATURES VARYING FROM 1° TO 40°.\r\n\r\n                  Weight,                  Weight,\r\n    Temperature.

Then the volume of the flask is equal to 11.72892 ÷\r\n0.998259, _viz._, 11.95 cubic centimeters.\r\n\r\n=50. Use of Pyknometer at High Temperatures.=—It is often found\r\ndesirable to determine the density of a liquid at temperatures above\r\nthat of the laboratory, _e. g._, at the boiling-point of water. This is\r\neasily accomplished by following the directions given below:\r\n\r\n_Weight of Flask._—Use a small pyknometer of from twenty-five to thirty\r\ncubic centimeters capacity. The stopper should be beveled to a fine\r\nedge on top and the lower end should be slightly concave to avoid any\r\ntrapping of air. The flask is to be thoroughly washed with hot water,\r\nalcohol and ether, and then dried for some time at 100°. After cooling\r\nin a desiccator the weight of the flask and stopper is accurately\r\ndetermined.[27]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 28. BATH FOR PYKNOMETERS.]\r\n\r\n_Weight of Water._—The flask in an appropriate holder, Fig. 28,\r\nconveniently made of galvanized iron, is filled with freshly boiled and\r\nhot distilled water and placed in a bath of pure, very hot distilled\r\nwater, in such a way that it is entirely surrounded by the liquid with\r\nthe exception of the top.\r\n\r\nThe water of the bath is kept in brisk ebullition for thirty minutes,\r\nany evaporation from the flask being replaced by the addition of\r\nboiling distilled water. The stopper should be kept for a few minutes\r\nbefore use in hot distilled water and is then inserted, the flask\r\nremoved, wiped dry, and, after it is nearly cooled to room temperature,\r\nplaced in the balance and weighed when balance temperature is reached.\r\nA convenient size of holder will enable the analyst to use eight or ten\r\nflasks at once. The temperature at which water boils in each locality\r\nmay also be determined; but unless at very high altitudes, or on days\r\nof unusual barometric disturbance the variations will not be great, and\r\nwill not appreciably affect the results.\r\n\r\n=51. Alternate Method of Estimating the Weight of Water in\r\nFlasks.=—Formulas for calculating the volume _V_, in cubic centimeters,\r\nof a glass vessel from the weight _P_ of water at the temperature _t_\r\ncontained therein, and the volume _Vʹ_ at any other temperature _t’_\r\nare given by Landolt and Börnstein.[28] They are as follows:\r\n\r\n              _p_\r\n    _V_ = _P_ ---\r\n              _d_\r\n\r\n                _p_\r\n    _Vʹ_ = _P_ ---- [1 + _γ_(_tʹ_- _t_)]\r\n                _d_\r\n\r\n_p_ = weight (in brass weights) of one cubic centimeter H₂O in vacuo.\r\nThis is so nearly one gram that it will not affect the result in the\r\nfifth place of decimals and may therefore be disregarded. Hence the\r\nformula stands:\r\n\r\n                 1\r\n    _Vʹ_ = _P_ ---- [1 + _γ_(_tʹ_-_t_)]; in which\r\n                _d_\r\n\r\n_d_ = density of water at temperature _t_.\r\n\r\n_γ_ = 0.000025, the cubical expansion coefficient of glass.\r\n\r\nFrom this volume the weight of the water may be readily obtained by\r\nreferring to tables 13, 14 and 15_a_ in Landolt and Börnstein’s book.\r\n\r\n=52. Example Showing Determination of Specific Gravity of a Fat.=—The\r\nflask is emptied of its water, rinsed with alcohol and ether, and dried\r\nagain for a few minutes at 100°. It is then filled with the dry, hot,\r\nfresh-filtered fat, which should be entirely free from air bubbles.\r\n\r\nThe stoppered flask is then replaced in the water-bath, kept for thirty\r\nminutes at the temperature of boiling water, removed, and treated as\r\nabove. The weight of fat having been determined, the specific gravity\r\nis obtained by dividing it by the weight of water previously found.\r\n\r\n               _Example._\r\n                                           Grams.\r\n    Weight of flask, dry                  10.0197\r\n    Weight of flask, plus water           37.3412\r\n    Weight of water                       27.3215\r\n    Weight of flask, plus fat             34.6111\r\n    Weight of fat                         24.5914\r\n\r\n    Specific gravity = 24.5914 ÷ 27.3215 = 0.90008.\r\n\r\nThe weight of the flask dry and empty and the weight of water at 99° to\r\n100° contained therein may be used constantly if great care be taken in\r\nhandling and cleaning the apparatus.\r\n\r\n               _Example._\r\n                                              Grams.\r\n    Weight of flask, dry and empty           10.0028\r\n    Weight of flask after three weeks’ use   10.0030\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 29. AEREOMETERS, PYKNOMETERS, AND HYDROSTATIC\r\nBALANCE.]\r\n\r\n=53. Determination of Density by the Hydrostatic Balance.=—While\r\nthe pyknometer is useful in control work and in fixing standards of\r\ncomparison, it is not used extensively in practical work. Quicker\r\nmethods of determination are desired in such work, and these are\r\nfound in the use of other forms of apparatus. A convenient method of\r\noperation consists in determining the weight of a sinker, whose exact\r\nweights in air and in pure water of a definite temperature, have been\r\npreviously determined. The instrument devised by Mohr and modified by\r\nWestphal, is based upon that principle, and is extensively used in\r\npractical work. The construction of this apparatus and also that of the\r\npyknometers and areometers is shown in the illustrations, figures 29\r\nand 30.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 30. HYDROSTATIC BALANCE.]\r\n\r\nThe weight of the sinker is so adjusted that the index of the balance\r\narm marks zero when the sinker is wholly immersed in pure water at\r\nthe standard temperature. The density of a solution of sugar at the\r\nsame temperature, is then determined by placing the rider-weights on\r\nthe divided arm of the balance, until the index again marks zero. The\r\ndensity can then be read directly from the position of the weights in\r\nthe arm of the balance or calculated therefrom.\r\n\r\n=54. The Areometric Method.=—The most rapid method of determining\r\nthe density of a solution and the one in most common use, is based\r\non the distance to which a heavy bulb with a slender graduated stem\r\nwill sink therein. An instrument of this kind is called an areometer.\r\nMany forms of this instrument are employed but they all depend on the\r\nsame principle and differ only in the manner of graduation. The one of\r\nwidest application has the stem graduated in such a manner as to give\r\ndirectly the specific gravity of the solution in which it is placed.\r\n\r\nOthers are made with a special graduation giving directly the\r\npercentage of solid matter in the solution. These instruments can be\r\nused only for the special purposes for which they are constructed.\r\nOther forms are provided with an arbitrary graduation, the numbers\r\nof which by appropriate tables can be converted into expressions of\r\nspecific gravity or of per cents of dissolved matters. It is not\r\npracticable to give here, a discussion of the principles of the\r\nconstruction of areometers.[29] The two which are commonly used, are the\r\nbaumé hydrometer and the balling or brix spindle.\r\n\r\nIn the baumé instrument the zero of the scale is fixed at the point\r\nmarked by the surface of distilled water at 15°, and the point to which\r\nit sinks in pure monohydrated sulfuric acid at the same temperature is\r\nmarked 66, corresponding to a specific gravity of 1.8427.\r\n\r\nThe specific gravity corresponding to any degree of the scale, may be\r\ncalculated in the absence of a table giving it, by the following formula\r\n\r\n             144.3\r\n    _P_ = -----------.\r\n          144.3 - _d_\r\n\r\nIn this formula _P_ is the density and _d_ the degree of the scale.[30]\r\nIn former times the baumé instruments were graduated with a solution\r\nof common salt and a different formula was employed for calculating\r\nspecific gravity, but these older instruments are no longer in common\r\nuse.\r\n\r\nThe following table shows the specific gravities of solutions\r\ncorresponding to baumé degrees from 1° to 75° consecutively[31]:\r\n\r\n    Degree  Specific Degree  Specific Degree  Specific Degree  Specific\r\n    baumé   gravity  baumé   gravity   baumé  gravity  baumé   gravity\r\n     0      1.0000     19     1.1516    38     1.3574    57     1.6527\r\n     1      1.0069     20     1.1608    39     1.3703    58     1.6719\r\n     2      1.0140     21     1.1702    40     1.3834    59     1.6915\r\n     3      1.0212     22     1.1798    41     1.3968    60     1.7115\r\n     4      1.0285     23     1.1895    42     1.4104    61     1.7321\r\n     5      1.0358     24     1.1994    43     1.4244    62     1.7531\r\n     6      1.0433     25     1.2095    44     1.4386    63     1.7748\r\n     7      1.0509     26     1.2197    45     1.4530    64     1.7968\r\n     8      1.0586     27     1.2301    46     1.4678    65     1.8194\r\n     9      1.0665     28     1.2407    47     1.4829    66     1.8427\r\n    10      1.0744     29     1.2514    48     1.4983    67     1.8665\r\n    11      1.0825     30     1.2624    49     1.5140    68     1.8909\r\n    12      1.0906     31     1.2735    50     1.5301    69     1.9161\r\n    13      1.0989     32     1.2849    51     1.5465    70     1.9418\r\n    14      1.1074     33     1.2964    52     1.5632    71     1.9683\r\n    15      1.1159     34     1.3081    53     1.5802    72     1.9955\r\n    16      1.1246     35     1.3201    54     1.5978    73     2.0235\r\n    17      1.1335     36     1.3323    55     1.6157    74     2.0523\r\n    18      1.1424     37     1.3447    56     1.6340    75     2.0819\r\n\r\n=55. Correction for Temperature.=—The baumé hydrometer should be used\r\nat the temperature for which it is graduated, usually 15°. In this\r\ncountry the mean temperature of our working rooms is above 15°. The\r\nliquid in the hydrometer flask should therefore be cooled to a trifle\r\nbelow 15°, or kept in a bath exactly at 15° while the observation is\r\nmade. When this is not convenient, the observation may be made at any\r\ntemperature, and the reading corrected as follows: When the temperature\r\nis above 15° multiply the difference between the observed temperature\r\nand fifteen, by 0.0471 and add the product to the observed reading of\r\nthe baumé hydrometer; when the temperature on the other hand, is below\r\nfifteen, the corresponding product is subtracted.[32]\r\n\r\n=56. The Balling or Brix Hydrometer.=—The object of the balling or\r\nbrix instrument is to give in direct percentages the solid matter in\r\nsolution. It is evident that for this purpose the instrument must be\r\ngraduated for a particular kind of material, since ten per cent of\r\nsugar in solution, might have a very different specific gravity from a\r\nsimilar quantity of another body. Instruments of this kind graduated\r\nfor pure sugar, find a large use in technical sugar analysis. To\r\nattain a greater accuracy and avoid an instrument with too long a\r\nstem, the brix hydrometers are made in sets. A convenient arrangement\r\nis to have a set of three graduated as follows; one from 0° to 30°, one\r\nfrom 25° to 50°, and one from 45° to 85°. When the percentage of solid\r\nmatter dissolved is over seventy the readings of the scale are not very\r\nreliable.\r\n\r\n=57.

Error Due to Impurities.=—The fact that equal per cents of solid\r\nbodies in solution affect the specific gravity in different degrees\r\nhas already been noted. The specific gravities of the solutions of the\r\ncommon sugars, however, are so nearly the same for equal per cents of\r\nsolid matter in solution as to render the use of a brix hydrometer\r\nquite general for technical purpose. For the mineral salts which often\r\noccur in sugar solutions the case is quite different. A twenty per cent\r\nsolution of cane sugar at 17°.5 has a specific gravity 1.08329 and of\r\ndextrose 1.08310, practically identical. But a solution of calcium\r\nacetate of similar strength has a specific gravity of 1.0874; of sodium\r\nsulfate 1.0807, and of potassium nitrate 1.1359. This latter number\r\nwould correspond to a sugar content of nearly twenty-seven per cent.\r\nThe brix scale can, therefore, be regarded as giving only approximately\r\nthe percentage of solid matter in sugar solutions and, while useful in\r\ntechnical work, should never be relied upon for exact analytical data.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DETERMINATION OF SUGAR WITH POLARIZED LIGHT.\r\n\r\n=60. Optical Properties of Natural Sugars.=—The solutions of all\r\nnatural sugars have the property of deflecting the plane of polarized\r\nlight and the degree of deflection corresponds to the quantity of sugar\r\nin solution. By measuring the amplitude of the rotation produced the\r\npercentage of sugar in the solution can be determined. In order to\r\nsecure accuracy in the determinations it is necessary that only one\r\nkind of sugar be present, or, if more than one, that the quantities\r\nof all but one be determined by other means, and the disturbances\r\nproduced thereby in the total rotation be properly arranged. In point\r\nof fact the process in practice is applied chiefly to cane and milk\r\nsugars, both of which occur in nature in an approximately pure state.\r\nThe process is also useful in determining cane sugar when mixed with\r\nother kinds, by reason of the fact that this sugar after hydrolysis\r\nby treatment with a weak acid for a long or a strong acid for a short\r\ntime, definitely changes its rotating power. Since, by the same\r\ntreatment, the rotating power of other sugars which may be present is\r\nonly slightly altered, the total disturbance produced is approximately\r\ndue to the inversion of the cane sugar.\r\n\r\nDextrose and maltose arising from the hydrolysis of starch may also\r\nbe determined with a fair degree of accuracy by their deportment\r\nwith polarized light. When a solution of natural sugars shows\r\nnegative results when examined with polarized light, it is due to an\r\nadmixture of two or more sugars of opposite polarizing powers in such\r\nproportions as to produce neutrality. This condition often occurs\r\nin the examination of honeys or in submitting artificial sugars to\r\npolarimetric observations. In the latter case the neutrality is caused\r\nby the tendency manifested by artificially produced sugars to form twin\r\ncompounds of optically opposite qualities.\r\n\r\nThe instrument used for measuring the degree of deflection produced in\r\na plane of polarized light is called a polariscope, polarimeter, or\r\noptical saccharimeter. For a theoretical discussion of the principles\r\nof polarization and the application of these principles in the\r\nconstruction of polariscopes, the reader is referred to the standard\r\nworks on optics and the construction of optical instruments.[35] For\r\nthe purposes of this work a description of the instruments commonly\r\nemployed and the methods of using them will be sufficient.\r\n\r\n=61. Polarized Light.=—When a ray of light has been repeatedly\r\nreflected from bright surfaces or when it passes through certain\r\ncrystalline bodies it acquires peculiar properties and is said to be\r\npolarized.\r\n\r\nPolarization is therefore a term applied to a phenomenon of light, in\r\nwhich the vibrations of the ether are supposed to be restricted to a\r\nparticular form of an ellipse whose axes remain fixed in direction. If\r\nthe ellipse become a straight line it is called plane polarization.\r\nThis well-known phenomenon is most easily produced by a nicol prism,\r\nconsisting of a cut crystal of calcium carbonate (Iceland spar). This\r\nrhombohedral crystal, the natural ends of which form angles of 71° and\r\n109°, respectively, with the opposite edges of its principal section,\r\nis prepared as follows:\r\n\r\nThe ends of the crystals are ground until the angles just mentioned\r\nbecome 68° and 112°. The crystal is then divided diagonally at right\r\nangles with the planes of the ends and with the principal section, and\r\nafter the new surfaces are polished they are joined again by canada\r\nbalsam. The principal section of this prism passes through the shorter\r\ndiagonal of the two rhombic ends. If now a ray of light fall on one\r\nof the ends of this prism, parallel with the edge of its longer side,\r\nit suffers double refraction, and each ray is plane polarized, the\r\none at right angles with the other. That part of the entering ray of\r\nlight which is most refracted is called the ordinary and the other the\r\nextraordinary ray. The refractive index of the film of balsam being\r\nintermediate between those of the rays, permits the total reflection of\r\nthe ordinary ray, which, passing to the blackened sides of the prism,\r\nis absorbed. The extraordinary ray passes the film of balsam without\r\ndeviation and emerges from the prism in a direction parallel with the\r\nincident ray, having, however, only half of its luminous intensity.\r\n\r\nTwo such prisms, properly mounted, furnish the essential parts of a\r\npolarizing apparatus. They are called the polarizer and the analyzer,\r\nrespectively.\r\n\r\nIf now the plane of vibration in each prism be regarded as coincident\r\nwith its principal section, the following phenomena are observed:\r\nIf the prisms are so placed that the principal sections lie in the\r\nprolongation of the same plane, then the extraordinary polarized ray\r\nfrom the polarizer passes into the analyzer, which practically may\r\nbe regarded in this position as a continuation of the same prism.\r\nIt happens, therefore, that the extraordinary polarized ray passes\r\nthrough the analyzer exactly as it did through the polarizer, and is\r\nnot reflected by the film of balsam, but emerges from the analyzer\r\nin seemingly the same condition as from the polarizer. If now the\r\nanalyzer be rotated 180°, bringing the principal section again in the\r\nsame plane, the same phenomenon is observed. But if the rotation be in\r\neither direction only 90°, then the polarized ray from the first prism,\r\nincident on the second, deports itself exactly as the ordinary ray,\r\nand on meeting the film of balsam is totally reflected. The field of\r\nvision, therefore, is perfectly dark.\r\n\r\nIn all other inclinations of the planes of the principal sections of\r\nthe two prisms the ray incident in the analyzer is separated into\r\ntwo, an ordinary and extraordinary, varying in luminous intensity in\r\nproportion to the square of the cosine of the angle of the two planes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 31. COURSE OF RAYS OF LIGHT IN A NICOL.]\r\n\r\nThus, by gradually turning the analyzer, the field of vision passes\r\nslowly from maximum luminosity to complete obscurity. The expression\r\ncrossed nicols refers to the latter condition of the field of vision.\r\n\r\n=62. Description of the Prism.=—In a nicol made as described above,\r\nFig. 31, suppose a ray of light parallel with the longer side of the\r\nprism be incident to the end _a_ _b_ at _m_. By the double refracting\r\npower of the spar the ray is divided into two, which traverse the first\r\nhalf of the prism. The two rays are polarized at right angles to one\r\nanother. The less refracted ray when it strikes the film of Canada\r\nbalsam passes through it without interference. The more refracted ray\r\nstrikes the balsam at _o_ at such an angle as to be totally reflected\r\nand made to pass out of the prism in the direction _o r_. If the prism\r\nbe blackened at the surface the ray will be entirely absorbed. The\r\nother ray passes on through the other half of the prism and emerges in\r\nthe direction of _qs_. It is evident that the emergent light from a\r\nnicol has only half the illuminating power possessed by the immergent\r\nrays.\r\n\r\nThe polarized plane of light from the nicol just described may be\r\nregarded as passing also into a second nicol of essentially the same\r\nconstruction as the first.\r\n\r\nThis second nicol, called the analyzer, is so constructed as to\r\nrevolve freely about its longitudinal axis, and is attached to a\r\ngraduated circle in such a way that the degree of rotation can be\r\naccurately read. If the planes of polarization of the two nicols are\r\ncoincident when prolonged, the ray of light passing from the first\r\nnicol will pass through the second practically unchanged in character\r\nor intensity. If, however, the analyzing nicol be turned until the\r\nplane of polarization is at right angles to that of the polarizer the\r\nimmergent ray will suffer refraction in such a manner as to be totally\r\nreflected when reaching the film of balsam and will be thus entirely\r\nlost. In making a complete revolution of the analyzer, therefore, two\r\npositions of maximum intensity of light and two of darkness will be\r\nobserved. In intermediate positions the ray immergent to the analyzer\r\nwill be separated as in the first instance into two rays _g p_ varying\r\nintensities, one of which will be always totally reflected.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 32. THEORY OF THE NICOL.]\r\n\r\nIn Fig. 32 is given a more detailed illustration of the action of the\r\nrays of light. The film of balsam is represented as enlarged and of\r\nthe thickness _bb_. Draw the perpendiculars represented by the dotted\r\nlines _n_₁ _n_ʹ₁, _n_₂ _n_ʹ₂, _n_₃ _n_ʹ₃ and _n_₄ _n_ʹ₄. In passing\r\ninto the prism at _m_ both refracted rays are bent towards the normal\r\n_m n_ʹ₁. The degree of deflection depends on the refractive index of\r\nthe two rays 1.52 and 1.66 respectively. The refractive index of the\r\nextraordinary ray in calcspar being 1.52, and in Canada balsam 1.54,\r\nit suffers but little disturbance in passing from one to the other.\r\nOn the other hand the balsam, being considerably less refractive\r\nfor the ordinary ray than the calcspar, causes that ray to diverge\r\noutwards from the normal _o n_ʹ₂, and to such a degree as to suffer\r\ntotal reflection. The critical angle, that is the angle at which a ray\r\nissuing from a more refractive into a less refractive medium, emerges\r\njust parallel to the bounding surfaces, depends on the relative index\r\nof refraction. In the case under consideration the ratio for balsam\r\nand spar is 1.54/1.66 = 0.928 = sin 68°. Therefore the limiting value\r\nof _m o_ _n_₃ so that _m o_ may just emerge in the direction _od_ is\r\n68°. If now _mo_ were parallel to _o d_ the angle _m o n_, would be\r\njust 68°, being opposite _b a d_. which has been ground to 68° in the\r\nconstruction of the prism. But in passing into the prism, _m o_ is\r\nrefracted so that the angle _m o n_₃ is greater than _b a d_. It is\r\ntherefore always certain that by grinding _b a d_ to 68° the ordinary\r\nray _m o_ will be with certainty entirely thrown out in every case. In\r\nrespect of the analyzing nicol the following additional observations\r\nwill be found useful. In all uniaxial crystals there are two directions\r\nat right angles to each other, one of greatest and one of least\r\nresistance to the propagation of luminous vibrations. These planes are\r\nin the direction of the principal axis and at right angles thereto.\r\nOnly light vibrating in these two directions can be transmitted through\r\ncalcspar; and all incident light propagated by vibrations in a plane\r\nat any other angle to the principal section is resolved into two\r\nsuch component rays. But the velocities of transmission in the two\r\ndirections are unequal, that is, the refractive index of the spar for\r\nthe two rays is different. If the analyzing nicol be so adjusted as to\r\nreceive the emergent light from the polarizer when the corresponding\r\nplanes of the two prisms are coincident when extended, the emergent\r\nextraordinary ray falling into a plane of the same resistance as\r\nthat it had just left is propagated through the second nicol with\r\nthe same velocity that it passed the first one. It is therefore\r\nsimilarly refracted. If, however, the two prisms be so arranged that\r\ncorresponding planes cross then the extraordinary ray falls into a\r\nplane which it traverses with greater velocity than it had before and\r\nis accordingly refracted and takes the course which ends in total\r\nreflection at the film of balsam. No light therefore can pass through\r\nthe prism in that position. If any other substance, as for instance\r\na solution of sugar, capable of rotating a plane of polarized light,\r\nbe interposed between the two nicols the effect produced is the same\r\nas if the analyzer had been turned to a corresponding degree. When\r\nthe analyzer is turned to that degree the corresponding planes again\r\ncoincide and the light passes. This is the principle on which the\r\nconstruction of all polarizing instruments is based.[36]\r\n\r\n=63. The Polariscope.=—A polariscope for the examination of solutions\r\nof sugar consists essentially of a prism for polarizing the light,\r\ncalled a nicol, a tube of definite length for holding the sugar\r\nsolution, a second nicol made movable on its axis for adjustment to\r\nthe degree of rotation and a graduated arc for measuring it. Instead\r\nof having the second nicol movable, many instruments have an adjusting\r\nwedge of quartz of opposite polarizing power to the sugar, by means of\r\nwhich the displacement produced on the polarized plane is corrected.\r\nA graduated scale and vernier serve to measure the movement of the\r\nwedges and give in certain conditions the desired reading of the\r\npercentage of sugar present. Among the multitude of instruments which\r\nhave been devised for analytical purposes, only three will be found\r\nin common use, and the scope of this volume will not allow space\r\nfor a description of a greater number. For a practical discussion\r\nof the principles of polarization and their application to optical\r\nsaccharimetry, the reader may conveniently refer to the excellent\r\nmanuals of Sidersky, Tucker, Landolt, and Wiechmann.[37]\r\n\r\n=64. Kinds of Polariscopes.=—The simplest form of a polarizing\r\napparatus consists of two nicol prisms, one of which, _viz._, the\r\nanalyzer, is capable of rotation about its long axis. The prolongation\r\nof this axis is continuous with that of the other prism, _viz._, the\r\npolarizer. The two prisms are sufficiently removed from each other to\r\nallow of the interposition of the polarizing body whose rotatory power\r\nis to be measured.\r\n\r\nFor purposes of description three kinds of polarimeters may be\r\nmentioned.\r\n\r\n1. _Instruments in which the deviation of the plane of polarization is\r\nmeasured by turning the analyzer about its axis._\r\n\r\nInstruments of this kind conform to the simple type first\r\nmentioned, and are _coeteris paribus_ the best. The Laurent, Wild,\r\nLandolt-Lippich, etc., belong to this class.\r\n\r\n2. _Instruments in which both nicols are fixed and the direction of the\r\nplane of polarized light corrected by the interposition of a wedge of a\r\nsolid polarizing body._\r\n\r\nBelonging to this class are the apparatus of Soleil, Duboscq,\r\nScheibler, and the compensating apparatus of Schmidt and Haensch.\r\n\r\n3. _Apparatus in which the analyzer is set at a constant angle with\r\nthe polarizer, and the compensation secured by varying the length or\r\nconcentration of the interposed polarizing liquid._\r\n\r\nThe apparatus of Trannin belongs to this class.\r\n\r\n=65. Appearance of Field of Vision.=—Polarimeters are also classified\r\nin respect of the appearance of the field of vision.\r\n\r\n1. _Tint Instruments._—The field of vision in these instruments in\r\nevery position of the nicols, except that on which the plane of\r\nvibration of the polarized light is coincident with the three principal\r\nsections, is composed of two semi-disks of different colors.\r\n\r\n2. _Shadow Instruments._—The field of vision in this class of\r\npolarimeters in all except neutral positions, is composed of two\r\nsemi-disks, one dark and one yellow. As the neutral position is\r\napproximated the two disks gradually assume a light yellow color, and\r\nwhen neutrality is reached they appear to be equally colored.\r\n\r\nThe Laurent, Schmidt and Haensch shadow and Landolt-Lippich\r\ninstruments, are of this class.\r\n\r\n3. _Striated Instruments._—In this class the field of vision is\r\nstriated. The lines may be tinted as in Wild’s polaristrobometer or\r\nblack, as in the Duboscq and Trannin instruments. The neutral position\r\nis indicated either by the disappearance of the striae (Wild) or by the\r\nphenomenon of their becoming continuous. (Duboscq, Trannin.)\r\n\r\n=66. Character of Light Used.=—Polariscopes may be further divided into\r\ntwo classes, based on the kind of light employed.\r\n\r\n1. _Instruments which Use Ordinary White Light._—(Oil lamp, etc.)\r\nScheibler, Schmidt and Haensch.\r\n\r\n2. _Instruments Employing Monochromatic Light._—(Sodium flame, etc.)\r\nLaurent, Landolt-Lippich, etc.\r\n\r\n=67. Interchangeable Instruments.=—Some of the instruments in common\r\nuse are arranged to be used either with ordinary lamp or gas light, or\r\nwith a monochromatic flame. Laurent’s polarimeter is one of this kind.\r\nThe compensating instruments also may have the field of vision arranged\r\nfor tints or shadows. Theoretically the best instrument would be one in\r\nwhich the light is purely monochromatic, the field of vision a shadow,\r\nand the compensation secured by the rotation of the second nicol.\r\n\r\nThe accuracy of an instrument depends, however, on the skill and care\r\nwith which it is constructed and used. With quartz wedges properly\r\nground and mounted, and with ordinary white light, polariscopes may be\r\nobtained which give readings as accurate as can be desired.\r\n\r\nSince many persons are more or less affected with color-blindness, the\r\nshadow are to be preferred to the tint fields of vision.\r\n\r\nFor practical use in sugar analysis the white light is much more\r\nconvenient than the monochromatic light.\r\n\r\nFor purposes of general investigation the polarimeters built on\r\nthe model of the laurent are to be preferred to all others. Such\r\ninstruments are not only provided with a scale which shows the\r\npercentage of sucrose in a solution, but also with a scale and vernier\r\nby means of which the angular rotation which the plane of vibration has\r\nsuffered, can be accurately measured in more than one-quarter of the\r\ncircle.\r\n\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION OF POLARIZING INSTRUMENTS.\r\n\r\n=68. Rotation Instruments.=—This instrument has already been described\r\nas one in which the extent of deviation in the plane of polarized light\r\ncaused by the intervention of an optically active substance is measured\r\nby rotating one of the nicols about its axis and measuring the degree\r\nof this rotation by a vernier on a graduated arc.\r\n\r\nIn Germany these instruments are called _polaristrobometers_, and\r\nin France _polarimètrés_. In England and this country the term\r\n_polariscope_ or _polarimeter_ is applied without discrimination to all\r\nkinds of optical saccharimeters.\r\n\r\nThe polariscope of Mitscherlich was one of the earliest in use. It has\r\nnow been entirely superseded by more modern and accurate instruments.\r\n\r\n=69. The Laurent Instrument.=—A polariscope adapted by Laurent to\r\nthe use of monochromatic yellow light is almost exclusively used in\r\nFrance and to a considerable extent in this country. In case a worker\r\nis confined to the use of a single instrument, the one just mentioned\r\nis to be recommended as the best suited to general work. It has the\r\nsecond nicol, called the analyzer, movable and the degree of rotation\r\nproduced is secured in angular terms directly on a divided circle. The\r\nscale is graduated both in angular measurements and in per cents of\r\nsugar for a definite degree of concentration of the solution and length\r\nof observation tube. The normal solution in the laurent instrument\r\ncontains 16.19 grams of pure sugar in 100 true cubic centimeters, and\r\nthe length of the observation tube is 200 millimeters. Both the angular\r\nrotation and the direct percentage of sugar can be read at the same\r\ntime. Great accuracy can be secured by making the readings in each\r\nof the four quadrants. The light is rendered yellow monochromatic by\r\nbringing into the flames of a double bunsen, spoons made of platinum\r\nwire, which carry fragments of fused sodium chlorid.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 33. LAURENT LAMP.]\r\n\r\n=70. The Laurent Burner.=—The theory of the illumination of the laurent\r\nburner is illustrated by the accompanying Fig. 33. The lamp consists\r\nessentially of two bunsens, surmounted by a chimney.[38] A curved\r\nspoon made of platinum gauze serves to hold the fused particles of\r\nsodium chlorid which are used to produce the yellow light. The spoon\r\nis shown at G, held by the arm F, fastened by the key P. The interior\r\nintense flame B B is surrounded by an exterior less highly colored\r\nflame A A. It is important that the optical axis of the polariscope\r\nbe directed accurately upon the disk B, which is the most intense\r\npart of the illumination. The point of the spoon carrying the salt\r\nshould be coincident with the prolongation of the lamp TT, so that it\r\njust strikes the edge of the blue flame. Care should be taken not to\r\npress the spoons into the interior of the flame as by so doing the\r\nintensity of the illumination is very much diminished. Great care must\r\nbe observed in the position of the spoon G, and the platinum arm F\r\nbeing flexible, the operator with a little patience, will be enabled\r\nto properly place the spoon by bending it. Moreover, if the spoon be\r\npressed too far into the flame, the melted particles of salt collecting\r\nin the bottom of G may drop into the lamp and occlude the orifices\r\nthrough which the gas enters. The light of the yellow flame produced by\r\nthe lamp may be further purified by passing through a prism filled with\r\na solution of potassium dichromate, or better, a homogeneous disk cut\r\nfrom a crystal of that salt.\r\n\r\nSince the flame produced by the above device is not perfectly constant,\r\nbeing more intense at the moment of introducing a fresh portion of\r\nthe fused salt, the author has used a lamp designed to furnish an\r\nabsolutely constant flame.[39] This device which is shown in Fig. 34,\r\nis based on the principle of adding constantly a fresh portion of the\r\nsalt to the flame. The flame is thus kept perfectly uniform in its\r\nintensity.\r\n\r\nThe lamp consists essentially of two wheels with platinum gauze\r\nperimeters and platinum wire spokes, driven by a clock-work D, and\r\nmounted by the supports AAʹ as shown in the figure. The sodium salt,\r\nchlorid or bromid, in dilute solution, is placed in the porcelain\r\ncrucibles F, supported by BBʹ as indicated in the figure, to such a\r\ndepth that the rims of the platinum wheels dip beneath the surface as\r\nthey revolve. The salt is volatilized by the lamp E. By means of the\r\ncrossed bands the wheels are made to revolve in opposite directions\r\nas indicated by the arrows. The solution of the salt which is taken\r\nup by the platinum net-work of the rim of the wheel, thus has time\r\nto become perfectly dry before it enters the flame and the sputtering\r\nwhich a moist salt would produce is avoided. At every instant, by this\r\narrangement, a minute fresh portion of salt is introduced into the\r\nflame with the result of making a perfectly uniform light which can\r\nbe used for hours without any perceptible variation. The mechanism of\r\nthe apparatus is so simple that no further description is necessary.\r\nThe polariscope should be so directed toward the flame as to bring\r\ninto the field of vision its most luminous part. The platinum wheels\r\nare adjustable and should be so arranged as to produce between them an\r\nunbroken yellow flame. The wheels are eight centimeters in diameter and\r\nare driven at a rate to make one revolution in from six to ten minutes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 34. LAMP FOR PRODUCING CONSTANT MONOCHROMATIC\r\nFLAME.]\r\n\r\n=71. Construction of Laurent’s Apparatus.=—The shadow polariscope\r\ninvented by Laurent is constructed as follows: The polarizer is a\r\nspecial nicol which is not fixed in its position, but is so arranged\r\nas to be turned through a small arc about its axis. By this device,\r\nthe quantity of light passing through it can be regulated, and the\r\napparatus is thus useful with colored solutions which are not easily\r\ncleared by any of the common bleaching agents. The greater the quantity\r\nof light admitted, however, the less delicate is the reading of the\r\nshadow produced. The plane of polarized light emergent from this prism,\r\nfalls on a disk of glass half covered by a thin lamina of quartz which\r\nthus divides the field of vision into halves. It is this semi-disk of\r\nquartz which is the distinguishing feature of the apparatus.[40] The\r\npolarized light thus passes without hindrance the half field of vision\r\nwhich is covered by the glass only, but can not pass the quartz plate\r\nunless its axis is set in a certain way. The field of vision may be\r\nthus half dark, or both halves may be equally illuminated or equally\r\ndark according to the position of the nicol analyzer which is freely\r\nmovable about its axis and carries a vernier and reading glass over\r\na graduated circle. The field of vision in the laurent may have any\r\nof the following forms.[41] Let the polarizer be first so adjusted\r\nthat the plane of polarization of the transmitted pencil of light is\r\nparallel to the axis of the plate lying in the direction A B. The two\r\nhalves of the field of vision will then appear equally illuminated in\r\nevery position of the analyzer. But if the polarizing nicol be inclined\r\nto AB at an angle a, the plane of polarization of the rays passing\r\nthrough the quartz plate will undergo deviation through an equal angle\r\nin the opposite direction.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 35. FIELD OF VISION OF A LAURENT POLARISCOPE.]\r\n\r\nIt happens from this, that when in the uncovered half of the field, the\r\nplane of polarization has the direction AC, in the other half it will\r\nhave the direction ACʹ. When the analyzer is rotated, if its plane of\r\npolarization lie in the direction cc, the rays polarized parallel to AC\r\nwill be completely extinguished and the corresponding half of the field\r\nwill be dark. The opposite happens when the plane of polarization lies\r\nin the direction of cʹcʹ. When one-half of the field is thus obscured,\r\nthe other suffers only a partial diminution in the intensity of its\r\nillumination. When the middle position bb is reached in the rotation of\r\nthe analyzer, the illumination of the two halves is uniform, and this\r\nis the point at which the zero of the scale is reached. The slightest\r\nrotation of the analyzer to the right or left of this neutral point\r\nwill cause a shadow to appear on one of the halves of the field, which\r\nby an oscillatory movement of the analyzer, seems to leap from side\r\nto side. The smaller the angle _a_ or BAC, the more delicate will be\r\nthe shading and the more accurate the observation. This angle being\r\nadjustable by the mechanism already described, should be made as small\r\nas will permit the admission of the quantity of light requisite for\r\naccurate observation.\r\n\r\nThe various pieces composing the polariscope are arranged in the\r\nfollowing positions, beginning on the right of Fig. 36, and passing to\r\nthe left, where the observer is seated.[42]\r\n\r\n1. The lamp VV, TT, AA, or the wheel burner:\r\n\r\n2. The lens B for condensing the rays and rendering them parallel:\r\n\r\n3. The tube I, blackened inside to carry the lens:\r\n\r\n4. A thin lamina E, cut from a crystal of potassium bichromate, serving\r\nto render the sodium light more monochromatic: When the saccharine\r\nliquids under examination are colored the crystal of bichromate is\r\nremoved before the observation is made.\r\n\r\n5. The polarizer R, which is rotatable through a small angle by the\r\nlever K:\r\n\r\n6. The lever JK for rotating the tube containing the polarizer: This is\r\noperated by the rod X extending to the left.\r\n\r\n7. Diaphragm D, half covered with a lamina of quartz.\r\n\r\n8. Trough L for holding the observation tube: In the large instrument\r\nshown in the figure, it is more than half a meter in length and\r\narranged to hold an observation tube 500 millimeters long.\r\n\r\n9. Disk C, carrying divided circle and arbitrary sugar scale:\r\n\r\n10. Mirror M, to throw the light of the lamp on the vernier of the\r\nscale:\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 36. LAURENT POLARISCOPE.]\r\n\r\n11. Reading glass N, carried on the same radius as the mirror and used\r\nto magnify and read the scale:\r\n\r\n12. Device F, to regulate the zero of the instrument:\r\n\r\n13. Tube H, carrying a nicol analyzer and ocular O for defining the\r\nfield of vision: This tube is rotated by the radial arm G, carrying the\r\nmirror and reading glass.\r\n\r\n=72 Manipulation.=—The lamp having been adjusted, the instrument, in a\r\ndark room, is so directed that the most luminous spot of the flame is\r\nin the line of vision. An observation tube filled with water is placed\r\nin the trough and the zero of the vernier is placed accurately on the\r\nzero of the scale. The even tint of the field of vision is then secured\r\nby adjusting the apparatus by the device number 12.\r\n\r\n=73 The Soleil-Ventzke Polariscope.=—A form of polariscope giving a\r\ncolored field of vision was in use in this country almost exclusively\r\nuntil within ten years, and is still largely employed. There are\r\nmany forms of tint instruments, but the one almost exclusively used\r\nhere is that mentioned. A full description of their construction and\r\nmanipulation is given by Tucker.[43] By the introduction of a third\r\nrotating nicol in front of the lens next to the lamp, the sensitive\r\ntint at which the reading is made can be kept at a maximum delicacy.\r\nThese instruments are capable of rendering very reliable service,\r\nespecially in the hands of those who have a delicate perception of\r\ncolor. They are inferior, however, to the shadow instruments in\r\ndelicacy, and are more trying to the eye of the observer. The shadow\r\ninstruments therefore, especially those making use of an ordinary\r\nkerosene lamp, have practically driven the tint polariscopes out of use.\r\n\r\nThe general arrangement of a tint instrument as modified by Scheibler\r\nis shown in Fig. 37.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 37. TINT POLARISCOPE.]\r\n\r\nBeginning on the right of the figures, its optical parts are as\r\nfollows: A is a nicol which, with the quartz plate B, forms the\r\napparatus for producing the light rose neutral tint. The proper\r\ndegree of rotation of these two parts is secured by means of the\r\nbutton L attached to the rod carrying the ratchet wheel as shown. The\r\npolarizing nicol is at C, and D is a quartz disk, one-half of which is\r\nright-handed and the other left-handed. At G is another quartz plate\r\nbelonging to the analyzing part of the apparatus. This, together with\r\nthe fixed quartz wedge F, and the movable quartz wedge E, constitute\r\nthe compensating apparatus of the instrument whereby the deviation\r\nproduced in the plane of polarized light by the solution in the tube is\r\nrestored.\r\n\r\nNext to the compensating apparatus is the analyzing nicol which in\r\nthis instrument is fixed in a certain place, _viz._, the zero of the\r\nscale. The analyzer and the telescope for observing the field of vision\r\nare carried in the tube HJ. The movable quartz wedge has a scale which\r\nis read with a telescope K, provided with a mirror inclined at an angle\r\nof 45°, just over the scale and serving to illuminate it. The quartz\r\nwedges are also provided with a movement by which the zero point of\r\nthe scale can be adjusted. A kerosene lamp with two flat wicks is the\r\nbest source of illumination and the instrument should be used in a dark\r\nroom and the light of the lamp, save that which passes through the\r\npolariscope, be suppressed by a shade. The sensitive or transition tint\r\nis produced by that position of the regulating apparatus which gives\r\na field of view of such a nature that a given small movement of the\r\nquartz compensating wedge gives the greatest contrast in color between\r\nthe halves of the field of vision. For most eyes a faint rose-purple\r\ntint, as nearly colorless as possible, possesses this quality. A slight\r\nmovement of the quartz wedge by means of the screw head M will, with\r\nthis tint, produce on one side a faint green and on the other a pink\r\ncolor, which are in strong contrast. The neutral point is reached by so\r\nadjusting the quartz wedge as to give to both halves of the field the\r\nsame faint rose-purple tint.\r\n\r\n=74. The Shadow Polariscope for Lamp Light.=—This form of instrument\r\nis now in general use for saccharimetric purposes. It possesses on\r\nthe one hand, the advantages of those instruments using monochromatic\r\nlight, and on the other, the ease of manipulation possessed by the tint\r\npolariscopes. It differs from the tint instrument in dispensing with\r\nthe nicol and quartz plate used to regulate the sensitive tint, and\r\nin having its polarizing nicol peculiarly constructed in harmony with\r\nthe optical principles of the jellet-corny prism. The more improved\r\nforms of the apparatus have a double quartz wedge compensation. The\r\ntwo wedges are of opposite optical properties, and serve to make\r\nthe observations more accurate by mutual correction. The optical\r\narrangement of the different parts of such a polariscope is shown in\r\nthe following figure.\r\n\r\nThe lenses for concentrating the rays of light and rendering them\r\nparallel are contained in the tube N. At O is placed the modified\r\npolarizing nicol. The two compensating quartz wedges are moved by the\r\nmilled screw-heads EG. The rest of the optical apparatus is arranged\r\nas described under the tint polariscope. For practical purposes, only\r\none of the wedges is employed, but for all accurate work the readings\r\nshould be made with both wedges and thus every possible source of error\r\neliminated.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 38. DOUBLE COMPENSATING SHADOW POLARISCOPE.]\r\n\r\n=75. The Triple Shadow Instrument.=—When properly made, all the\r\ninstruments which have been mentioned, are capable of giving accurate\r\nresults if used in harmony with the directions given. In the use\r\nof polariscopes having colored fields of vision a delicate sense\r\nof distinguishing between related tints is necessary to good work.\r\nColor-blind observers could not successfully use such apparatus. In\r\nthe shadow instruments it is only necessary to distinguish between the\r\nhalves of a field of vision unequally illuminated and to reduce this\r\ninequality to zero. A neutral field is thus secured of one intensity\r\nof illumination and of only one color, usually yellow. Such a field of\r\nvision permits of the easy discrimination between the intensity of the\r\ncoloration of its two halves, and is consequently not trying to the eye\r\nof the observer, and allows of great accuracy of discrimination. This\r\nfield of vision has lately been still further improved by dividing it\r\ninto three parts instead of two. An instrument of this kind, Fig. 39,\r\nin use in this laboratory, permits a delicacy of reading not possessed\r\nby any other instrument used for sugar analysis, and approaching that\r\nof the standard Landolt-Lippich apparatus, used by us for research\r\nwork and for determining the rotation of quartz plates and testing the\r\naccuracy of other polariscopes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 39. TRIPLE SHADOW POLARISCOPE.]\r\n\r\nThe triple shadow is secured by interposing in front of the polarizing\r\nnicol two small nicols as indicated in Fig. 40. The end views in\r\ndifferent positions of the polarizer are shown in the lower part of the\r\ndiagrams.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 40. APPARATUS FOR PRODUCING A TRIPLE SHADOW.]\r\n\r\nInstead of the comparison of the intensity of the illumination being\r\nmade on the halves of the field of vision it is made by comparing\r\nthe segments of the halves with a central band, which also changes\r\nin intensity synchronously with the two segments, but in an opposite\r\ndirection.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ANALYTICAL PROCESS.\r\n\r\n=76. General Principles.=—Having described the instruments chiefly\r\nemployed in the optical examination of sugar solutions, the next step\r\nis to apply them to the analytical work. A common set of directions for\r\nuse will be found applicable to all instruments with such modifications\r\nonly as are required by peculiarities of construction. With the\r\nbest made instruments it is always advisable to have some method of\r\ncontrolling the accuracy of the observation. The simplest way of doing\r\nthis is to test the apparatus by standard quartz plates. These plates\r\nare made from right-handed polarizing quartz crystal ground into plates\r\nof definite thickness and accurately tested by standard instruments.\r\nTheoretically such quartz plates deflect the plane of polarized light\r\nin a degree proportionate to their thickness, but practically some\r\nsmall deviations from the rule are found. With a source of light of the\r\nsame tint, and at a constant temperature, such plates become a safe\r\ntest for the accuracy of the graduation of polariscopes. They are more\r\nconvenient for use than pure sugar solutions of known strength which\r\nare the final standards in all disputed cases. These quartz plates\r\nare conveniently mounted in tubes of the same size as those holding\r\nthe sugar solution, and thus fit accurately into the trough of the\r\npolariscope, the optical axis of which passes through their center.\r\nThe quartz plate when used for setting the scale of a polariscope\r\nshould be placed always in the same position. In some plates slight\r\ndifferences of reading may be noticed on rotating the tubes holding\r\nthem. Theoretically, such differences should not exist, but in practice\r\nthey are sometimes found. The temperature of observation should also\r\nbe noted, and if not that at which the value of the plate was fixed a\r\nproper correction should be made.\r\n\r\n=77. Setting the Polariscope.=—While mention has been made of several\r\nforms of apparatus in the preceding paragraphs, those in common use\r\nare limited to a very small number. In this country quite a number of\r\ncolor instruments may still be found, together with a few laurents,\r\nand a constantly increasing number of shadow instruments for use with\r\nlamp light. The following description of setting the polariscope is\r\nespecially adapted to the last named instrument, but the principles of\r\nadjustment are equally applicable to all.\r\n\r\nThe scale of the instrument is first so adjusted by means of the\r\nadjusting screws provided with each instrument, as to bring the zero\r\nof the vernier and that of the scale exactly together. The telescope\r\nor ocular is then adjusted until the sharp line separating the halves\r\nof the field of vision is brought into focus. This being accomplished\r\nan observation tube filled with pure water is placed in the apparatus\r\nand the telescope again adjusted to bring the dividing line of the\r\nfield into focus. The beginner especially, should repeatedly study\r\nthis adjustment and be impressed with the fact that only in a sharply\r\ndefined field are practical observations of any worth. The importance\r\nof having all the lenses perfect and all the cover glasses without a\r\nflaw may be fully appreciated when it is remembered that the polarized\r\nray, already deprived of half its original luminous power, must pass\r\nthrough several centimeters of crystallized calcium carbonate, and\r\nhalf a dozen disks of glass and quartz, and as many lenses before\r\nreaching the eye of the observer. Only with the greatest care and\r\nneatness is it possible to secure the required degree of illumination.\r\nThe zero point having been well studied and accurately adjusted, the\r\nscale of the instrument may be tried with a series of quartz plates of\r\nknown polarizing power at the temperature of the observation. In the\r\napparatus with double quartz wedge compensation, it will be noticed\r\nthat the marks on one scale are black and on the other red. The\r\nblack is the working and the red the control scale. To operate this\r\ninstrument, the red scale is placed exactly at the zero point. The\r\nblack scale is also placed at zero, and if the field of vision is not\r\nneutral, it is made so by the micrometer screw with which the black\r\nscale is provided. In a right-handed solution, the red scale is left\r\nat zero and the black one moved to the right until neutrality in the\r\nfield of vision is reached and the reading is taken. The observation\r\ntube containing the sugar solution is taken out and the red scale\r\nmoved until the field of vision is again neutral and the reading of\r\nthe red scale taken. The two readings should agree. Any failure in the\r\nagreement shows some fault either in adjusting the apparatus or in its\r\nconstruction, or some error in manipulation.\r\n\r\nThe double compensating shadow instruments are more readily tested\r\nfor accuracy in all parts of the scale than those of any other\r\nconstruction. The two compensating wedges are cut with the greatest\r\ncare, one from a left-handed and the other from a right-handed\r\nperfectly homogeneous quartz crystal. Since faults in these wedges are\r\ndue either to lack of parallelism of surface, or of perpendicularity\r\nto the optical axis of the crystal, and since these faults of\r\ncrystallization or construction must be in a very limited degree common\r\nthey would not coincide once in many thousand times in the two wedges.\r\nThis is easily shown by the theory of probabilities. If, therefore, the\r\ntwo readings made at any point, should not agree, it must be due either\r\nto a fault in one of the wedges, or to a fault in reading or a lack of\r\nadjustment, as has been mentioned. In such cases the readings should be\r\nretaken and the errors are usually easily discovered.\r\n\r\n=78. Control Observation Tube.=—Instead of using quartz plates of known\r\nvalues for testing the accuracy of the scale, an observation tube may\r\nbe used, the length of which can be varied at the pleasure of the\r\nobserver.\r\n\r\nThe construction of a tube of this kind is shown in Fig. 40. The tube\r\nB is movable telescopically in A by means of the ratchet wheel shown.\r\nIt is closed at D water-tight by a glass disk. The tube B fits as\r\naccurately into A as is possible to permit of free movement, and any\r\nliquid which may infilter between its outer surface and the inner\r\nsurface of A is prevented from gaining exit by the washer C, which\r\nfits both tubes water-tight. The ratchet which moves B in A carries\r\na millimeter scale and vernier N whereby the exact thickness of the\r\nliquid solution between the surfaces of the glass disks D and E can be\r\nalways determined.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 41. CONTROL OBSERVATION TUBE.]\r\n\r\nBy this device the length of liquid under observation can be accurately\r\nread to a tenth of a millimeter. The cover glass E is held in position\r\nby any one of the devices in common use for this purpose in the case in\r\nquestion, by a bayonet fastening. The funnel T, communicating directly\r\nwith the interior of A, serves to hold the solution, there being always\r\nenough of it to fill the tube when D is removed to the maximum distance\r\nfrom C, which is usually a little more than 200 millimeters.\r\n\r\nLet the control tube be adjusted to 200 millimeters and filled with a\r\nsolution of pure sugar, which reads 100 per cent or degrees in a 200\r\nmillimeter tube. Since the degree of rotation is, other things being\r\nequal, proportional to the length of the column of polarizing solution,\r\nit follows that if the tube B be moved inward until the distance\r\nbetween D and C is 100 millimeters, the scale should read 50° or per\r\ncent. By adjusting the length of the distance between B and C it is\r\neasily seen that every part of the scale can be accurately tested.\r\n\r\nThe tube should be filled by removing the funnel and closing the\r\norifice with a screw cap which comes with the apparatus. The cap E\r\nis then removed and the tube filled in the ordinary manner. This\r\nprecaution is practiced to avoid carrying air bubbles into the tube\r\nwhen filled directly through the funnel. With a little care, however,\r\nthis danger may be avoided, or should air bubbles enter they can be\r\neasily removed by inclining the tube.\r\n\r\nIn case the solution used be not strictly pure it may still be employed\r\nfor testing the scale. Suppose, for instance, that a solution made up\r\nin the usual way, has been made from a sample containing only 99.4 per\r\ncent of sugar. Then in order to have this solution read 100° on the\r\nscale the tube should be set at 201.2 millimeters, according to the\r\nformula\r\n\r\n    200 × 100\r\n    --------- = 201.2.\r\n       99.4\r\n\r\nBy a similar calculation the position of the tube for reading any\r\ndesired degree on the scale can be determined. The importance of\r\ncontrolling all parts of the scale in compensating instruments is\r\nemphasized by the fact that a variation of only 0.016 millimeter in the\r\nthickness of the compensating wedge will cause a change of one degree\r\nin the reading of the instrument.\r\n\r\n=79. Setting the Polariscope with Quartz Plates.=—Pure sugar is\r\nnot always at the command of the analyst, and it is more convenient\r\npractically to adjust the instrument by means of quartz plates, the\r\nsugar values of which have been previously tested for the character\r\nof the light used. Assuming the homogeneity of a plate of quartz, the\r\ndegree of deflection which it imparts to a plane of polarized light\r\ndepends on the quality of the light, the thickness of the plate, and\r\nthe temperature.\r\n\r\nIn respect of the quality of light, red polarized rays are least, and\r\nviolet most deflected. The degree of rotation produced with any ray,\r\nat a given temperature, is directly proportional to the thickness of\r\nthe plate. Temperature affects the rotating power of a quartz plate\r\nin a degree highly significant from a scientific point of view and\r\nnot wholly negligible for practical purposes. The rotating power of a\r\nquartz plate increases with the temperature and the variation may be\r\ndetermined by the formula given below:[44]\r\n\r\nThe formula is applicable for temperatures between 0° and 100°. Its\r\nvalues are expressed in degrees of angular measure which can be\r\nconverted into degrees of the sugar scale by appropriate factors:\r\n\r\n_Formula.—a_ᵗ = _a_°(1 + 0.000146_t_);\r\n\r\nin which _a_° = polarization in angular degrees at 0°, _t_ the\r\ntemperature of observation and _a_ᵗ the rotation desired.\r\n\r\n_Example._—A quartz plate which has an angular rotation of 33° at 0°\r\nwill have a rotation at 20° of 33°.09834.\r\n\r\n_a_ᵗ = 33(1 + 0.000146 × 20) = 33.09834.\r\n\r\nSince in instruments using the ventzke scale one degree of the sugar\r\nscale is equal to 0.3467 degree angular measure, the sugar value of the\r\nquartz plate mentioned is equal to 95.47 percent; 33.09834 ÷ 0.3467 =\r\n95.47.\r\n\r\nThe sugar value of this plate at 0° is 95.18 per cent; 33 ÷ 0.3467 =\r\n95.18.\r\n\r\n=80. Tables for Correcting Quartz Plates.=—Instead of calculating the\r\nvariation in quartz plates for each temperature of observation, it is\r\nrecommended by the Bureau of Internal Revenue of the Treasury, to use\r\ncontrol quartz plates the values of which at any given temperature, are\r\nfound on a card which accompanies each one.[45] The variations given,\r\nare from temperatures between 10° and 35°. Three control plates are\r\nprovided with each instrument used by the Bureau, for polarimetric\r\nwork in the custom houses, or in ascertaining bounties to be paid on\r\nthe production of domestic sugars. For example, the case of a sugar\r\nwhich polarizes 80°.5 may be cited. One of the control plates nearest\r\nto this number, is found to have at the temperature of observation, a\r\npolarization of 91°.4, the reading being made in each case at 25°. On\r\nconsulting the card which accompanies the control plate, it is seen\r\nthat its value at the temperature mentioned, is 91°.7. The reading of\r\nthe instrument is therefore too low by three-tenths of a degree, and\r\nthis quantity should be added to the observed polarization, making it\r\n80°.8. In this method of correcting the reading for temperature, it is\r\nassumed that the compensating wedges of the instrument, are free of\r\nerror at the points of observation. The plates used for the purpose\r\nabove, are all standardized in the office of weights and measures of\r\nthe Coast and Geodetic Survey, before delivery to the analysts.\r\n\r\n=81. Applicability of Quartz Plates.=—Quartz plates which are correctly\r\nset for one instrument or kind of light, should be equally accurate\r\nfor the sugar scales of all instruments, using the same sugar factor.\r\nIn other words a quartz plate which reads 99° on a scheibler color\r\npolariscope, should give the same reading on the sugar scale of a\r\nshadow compensating or a monochromatic direct reading apparatus using\r\n26.048 grams of sugar.\r\n\r\nThe most useful quartz plates for sugar analysis, are those which give\r\nthe readings at points between 80° and 96°, which cover the limits of\r\nordinary commercial sugars. For molasses the plates should read from\r\n45° to 55°. For sugar juices of the cane and beet, the most convenient\r\ngraduation would be from 10° to 20°, but plates of this value would be\r\ntoo thin for practical work and are not in use. When quartz plates are\r\nto be used for control purposes, they should be purchased from reliable\r\nmanufacturers, or better, tested directly against pure sugar solutions\r\nby the observer.\r\n\r\nIn practice we have found quartz plates as a rule, true to their\r\nmarkings.\r\n\r\n=82. The Sugar Flask.=—Sugar solutions are prepared for polarization in\r\nflasks graduated to hold fifty or one hundred cubic centimeters. For\r\nscientific work a flask is marked to hold 100 grams of distilled water\r\nat 4°. The weights are all to be reduced to a vacuum standard. One\r\nflask having been marked in this way, others may be compared directly\r\ntherewith by means of pure mercury. For this purpose the flasks must be\r\nperfectly dry and the mercury pure, leaving no stain on the sides of\r\nthe flask. The glass must also be strong enough to undergo no change in\r\nshape from the weight of mercury used.\r\n\r\nFor sugar work the true 100 gram flask is not usually employed, but\r\none graduated by weighing at 17°.5. These flasks are graduated by\r\nfirst weighing them perfectly dry, filling with distilled water and\r\nagain weighing fifty and fifty-five, or 100 and 110 grams of water at\r\nthe temperature named. Since the volume of water at 17°.5 is greater\r\nthan at 4° the sugar flask in ordinary use has a greater volume by\r\nabout 0.25 cubic centimeter than the true flask. The observer should\r\nalways secure a statement from the dealer in respect of the volume\r\nof the flask used in testing the scale of the polariscope purchased.\r\nIn the graduation of a flask in true cubic centimeters, when brass\r\nweights are used it will be necessary to correct the weight of each\r\ngram of water by adding to it one milligram, which is almost exactly\r\nthe weight of the volume of air displaced by one gram of water in the\r\ncircumstances named. If the flask be first counterbalanced and it be\r\ndesired to mark it at 100 cubic centimeters the sum of the weights\r\nplaced in the opposite pan should be 100 - 0.100 = 99.900 grams. While\r\nthis is not a rigidly exact correction it will be sufficient for all\r\npractical purposes. A liter of dry air weighs 1.29366 grams; and 100\r\ncubic centimeters of water would therefore displace 0.129 gram of air.\r\nBut the brass weights also displace a volume of air which when deducted\r\nreduces the correction to be made for the water to nearly the one\r\nnamed. For convenience in inverting sugar solutions the flasks used in\r\npractical work are graduated at fifty and fifty-five and 100 and 110\r\ncubic centimeters respectively.\r\n\r\n=83. Preparing Sugar Solutions for Polarization.=—If sugar samples\r\nwere always pure the percentage of sugar in a given solution could be\r\ndirectly determined by immediate polarization. Such cases, however,\r\nare rarely met in practice. In the majority of cases the sample is\r\nnot only to be brought into solution but is also to be decolorized\r\nand rendered limpid by some one of the methods to be described. A\r\nperfectly limpid liquid is of the highest importance to secure correct\r\nobservations. With a cloudy solution the field of vision is obscured,\r\nthe dividing line of the two halves, or the double line in the triple\r\nfield, becomes blurred or invisible and the intensity of illumination\r\nis diminished. A colored liquid which is bright is far more easy to\r\npolarize than a colorless liquid which is turbid. In fact, it is only\r\nrarely in sugar work that samples will be found which require any\r\nspecial decolorizing treatment other than that which is received in\r\napplying the reagents which serve to make the solutions limpid. In the\r\nfollowing paragraphs the approved methods of clarifying sugar solutions\r\npreparatory to observation in the polariscope will be described.\r\n\r\n=84. Alumina Cream.=—The hydrate of alumina, commonly known as alumina\r\ncream, is always to be preferred as a clarifying agent in all cases\r\nwhere it can be successfully applied.[46] It is a substance that acts\r\nwholly in a mechanical way and therefore leaves the sugars in solution\r\nunchanged, carrying out only suspended matters. In the preparation\r\nof this reagent a solution of alum is treated with ammonia in slight\r\nexcess, the aluminum hydroxid produced washed on a filter or by\r\ndecantation until neutral in reaction. The hydroxid is suspended\r\nin pure water in proportions to produce a creamy liquid. Although\r\napparently very bulky, the actual space occupied by the amount of dry\r\nhydroxid added in a few cubic centimeters is so small as to produce no\r\ndisturbing effect of importance on the volume of the sugar solution.\r\nThe cream thus prepared is shaken just before using and from one to\r\nfive cubic centimeters of it, according to the degree of turbidity of\r\nthe saccharine solution, are added before the volume in the flask is\r\ncompleted to the mark. After filling the flask to the mark the ball of\r\nthe thumb is placed over the mouth and the contents well shaken and\r\nallowed to stand for a few moments before filtering.\r\n\r\nThe alumina cream is well suited to use with solutions of commercial\r\nsugars of not too low a grade and of most honeys and high grade\r\nsirups. It is usually not powerful enough to clarify beet and cane\r\njuices, molasses and massecuites.\r\n\r\n=85. Basic Lead Acetate.=—A solution of basic lead acetate is an\r\ninvaluable aid to the sugar analyst in the preparation of samples for\r\npolarimetric observation. It acts as a clarifying agent by throwing\r\nout of solution certain organic compounds and by uniting with the\r\norganic acids in solution forms an additional quantity of precipitate,\r\nand these precipitates act also mechanically in removing suspended\r\nmatters from solution. The action of this reagent is therefore much\r\nmore vigorous than that of alumina cream. Coloring matters are often\r\nprecipitated and removed by treatment with lead acetate. It happens\r\ntherefore that there are few samples of saccharine bodies whose\r\nsolutions cannot be sufficiently clarified by lead acetate to permit of\r\npolarimetric observation.\r\n\r\nThe reagent is most frequently employed of the following strength:[47]\r\nBoil for half an hour in one and a half liters of water 464 grams of\r\nlead acetate and 264 grams of litharge with frequent stirring. When\r\ncool, dilute with water to two liters, allow to stand until clear, and\r\ndecant the solution. The specific gravity of this solution is about\r\n1.267.\r\n\r\nIn a solution of basic lead acetate of unknown strength the percentage\r\nof lead acetate may be determined from its specific gravity by the\r\nfollowing table:[48]\r\n\r\n       PERCENTAGE OF LEAD ACETATE CORRESPONDING TO\r\n             DIFFERENT SPECIFIC GRAVITIES AT 15°.\r\n\r\n                       Percentage of                       Percentage of\r\n    Specific gravity.  lead acetate.

Errors Due to use of Lead Solutions.=—In the use of lead solutions\r\nthere is danger of errors intruding into the results of the work. These\r\nerrors are due to various sources. Lead subacetate solution, when\r\nused with low grade products, or sugar juices, or sirups from beets\r\nand canes, precipitates albuminous matters and also the organic acids\r\npresent. The bulk occupied by these combined precipitates is often of\r\nconsiderable magnitude, so that on completing the volume in the flask\r\nthe actual sugar solution present is less than indicated. The resulting\r\ncondensation tends to give too high a polarimetric reading. With purer\r\nsamples this error is of no consequence, but especially with low grade\r\nsirups and molasses it is a disturbing factor, which must be considered.\r\n\r\nOne of the best methods of correcting it has been proposed by\r\nScheibler.[49] To 100 cubic centimeters of a solution of the sample,\r\nten of lead solution are added, and after shaking and filtering\r\nthe polarimetric reading is taken. Another quantity of 100 cubic\r\ncentimeters of the solution with ten of lead is diluted to 220 cubic\r\ncentimeters, shaken, filtered, and polarized. Double the second\r\nreading, subtract it from the first, multiply the difference by 2.2,\r\nand deduct the product from the first reading. The remainder is the\r\ncorrect polarization.\r\n\r\nThe process just described is for the usual work with beet juices and\r\nsirups. For cane juices measured by the graduated pipette, hereafter to\r\nbe described, and for weighed samples of molasses and massecuites, the\r\nfollowing method of calculation is pursued.[50] To the sample dissolved\r\nin water, add a measured portion of the lead subacetate solution, make\r\nits volume 100 cubic centimeters and observe the polarimetric reading.\r\nPrepare a second solution in the same way and make the volume double\r\nthat of the first and again take the polarimetric reading. Multiply the\r\nsecond reading by two, subtract the product from the first reading and\r\nmultiply the remainder by two, and subtract the product from the first\r\nreading.\r\n\r\n    _Example._—First polarization           30.0\r\n               Second polarization          14.9\r\n               Then 30 - (2 × 14.9 = 29.8) =  0.2\r\n                          0.2 × 2          =  0.4\r\n                and 30 - 0.4               = 29.6\r\n\r\nThe corrected reading therefore shows that the sample contained 29.6\r\nper cent of sugar.\r\n\r\n=87. Error Due to Action of Lead Subacetate on Levulose.=—In the use of\r\nlead subacetate solution not only is there danger of error due to the\r\ncauses just described, but also to a more serious one, arising from the\r\nchemical interaction of the clarifying agent and levulose.[51]\r\n\r\nLead subacetate forms a chemical union with levulose and the resulting\r\ncompound has a different rotatory power from the left-handed sugar in\r\nan uncombined state. By adding a sufficient quantity of subacetate\r\nsolution, the left-handed rotation of levulose may be greatly\r\ndiminished if not entirely destroyed. In this case the dextrose, which\r\nwith levulose forms inverted sugar, serves to increase the apparent\r\nright rotation due to the sucrose in solution. The reading of the\r\nscale is therefore higher than would be given by the sucrose alone.\r\nIf the lead subacetate could be added in just the proportion to make\r\nthe invert sugar neutral to polarized light, its use would render the\r\nanalysis more accurate; but such a case could only arise accidentally.\r\nTo correct the error, after clarification, the compound of levulose and\r\nlead may be decomposed by the addition of acetic acid according to the\r\nmethod of Spencer. In this case the true content of sucrose can only be\r\nobtained by the method of inversion proposed by Clerget, which will be\r\ndescribed in another paragraph.\r\n\r\n=88. Clarification with Mercuric Compounds.=—Where the disturbing\r\nbodies in a solution are chiefly of an albuminoid nature, one of the\r\nbest methods of securing clarification is by the use of a solution\r\ncontaining an acid mercuric compound.[52] In the case of milk this\r\nmethod is to be preferred to all others. Albuminoid bodies themselves,\r\nhave the property of deflecting the plane of polarization, as a rule,\r\nto the left, and therefore, should be completely removed from solutions\r\ncontaining right-handed sugars such as lactose. For this purpose the\r\nmercuric compound is more efficient than any other. It is prepared and\r\nused as follows.[53] Dissolve mercury in double its weight of strong\r\nnitric acid and dilute the solution with an equal volume of water. One\r\ncubic centimeter of this solution is sufficient to clarify fifty times\r\nits volume of milk.\r\n\r\n=89. Decolorization by Means of Bone-Black.=—Where the means already\r\ndescribed fail to make a solution sufficiently colorless to permit of\r\nthe passage of a ray of polarized light, recourse should be had to a\r\ndecolorizing agent. The most efficient of these is bone-black. For\r\nlaboratory work it is finely ground and should be dry if added to an\r\nalready measured solution. When moist it should be added to the flask\r\nbefore the volume is completed, and a correction made for the volume of\r\nthe dry char employed. Bone-black has the power of absorbing a certain\r\nquantity of sugar, and for this reason as little of it should be\r\nemployed as is sufficient to secure the end in view. If not more than\r\none gram of the char be used for 100 cubic centimeters of solution,\r\nthe error is not important commercially. The error may be avoided by\r\nplacing the char on the filter and rejecting the first half of the\r\nfiltered solution. The char becomes saturated with the first portion\r\nof the solution, and does not absorb any sugar from the second. This\r\nmethod, however, does not secure so complete a decolorization as is\r\neffected by adding the black directly to the solution and allowing to\r\nstand for some time with frequent shaking.\r\n\r\n=90. Remarks on Analytical Process.=—Since large weights of sugar are\r\ntaken for polarization, a balance which will weigh accurately to one\r\nmilligram may be used. In commercial work the weighing is made in a\r\ncounterpoised dish with a prominent lip, by means of which the sample\r\ncan be directed into the mouth of the flask after partial solution.\r\nWhere the air in the working room is still, an uncovered balance is\r\nmost convenient. With a little practice the analyst will be able to\r\ndissolve and transfer the sample from the dish to the flask without\r\ndanger of loss. The source of light used in polarizing should be in\r\nanother room, and admitted by a circular opening in the partition. In a\r\nclose polarizing room, which results from the darkening of the windows,\r\nthe temperature will rapidly rise if a lamp be present, endangering\r\nnotably the accuracy of the work, and also interfering with the comfort\r\nof the observer. The greatest neatness must be practiced in all stages\r\nof the work, and especially the trough of the polariscope must be kept\r\nfrom injury which may arise from the leaking of the observation tubes.\r\nDust and dirt of all kinds must be carefully excluded from the lenses,\r\nprisms, wedges and plates of the instrument.\r\n\r\n=91. Determination of Sucrose by Inversion.=—In the foregoing\r\nparagraphs directions have been given for the estimation of sugar\r\n(sucrose) by its optical properties. It has been assumed so far, that\r\nno other disturbing bodies have been present, save those which could be\r\nremoved by the clarifying agents described. The case is different when\r\ntwo or more sugars are present, each of which has a specific relation\r\nto polarized light. In such cases some method must be used for the\r\noptical determination of sucrose, which is independent of the influence\r\nof the other polarizing bodies, or else recourse must be had to other\r\nmethods of analysis. The conversion of the sucrose present into invert\r\nsugar by the action of an acid or a ferment, affords an opportunity for\r\nthe estimation of sucrose in mixed sugars, by purely optical methods.\r\nThis process rests upon the principle that by the action of a dilute\r\nacid for a short time, or of a ferment for a long time, the sucrose\r\nis completely changed, while other sugars present are not sensibly\r\naffected. Neither of these assumptions is rigidly correct but each is\r\npractically applicable.\r\n\r\nThe sucrose by this process of hydrolysis is converted into an equal\r\nmixture of levulose and dextrose. The former, at room temperatures, has\r\nthe higher specific rotating power, and the deflection of the plane of\r\npolarization in a solution of inverted sugar is therefore to the left.\r\nThe levorotatory power of invert sugar varies with the temperature,\r\nand this arises from the optical properties of the levulose. The\r\ninfluence of temperature on the rotating power of other sugars, is not\r\nimperceptible in all cases, but in practice is negligible.\r\n\r\nThis method of analysis is invaluable in control work in factories,\r\nin the customs and in agricultural laboratories. Since the rotating\r\npower of levulose diminishes as the temperature rises, an accurate\r\nthermometric observation must accompany each polarimetric reading. At\r\nabout 88° the rotatory powers of dextrose and levulose are equal, and a\r\nsolution of pure invert sugar examined at that degree, is found to be\r\nneutral to polarized light.\r\n\r\n=92. Clerget’s Method of Inversion.=—The classical method of Clerget\r\nfor the determination of cane sugar by double polarization before and\r\nafter inversion, was first described in a memoir presented to the\r\nSociety of Encouragement for National Industry on the 14th of October,\r\n1846. The following description of the original method is taken from a\r\nreprint of the proceedings of that Society, dated Nov. 1846:\r\n\r\nClerget points out first the observation of Mitscherlich regarding\r\nthe influence of temperature on the rotatory power of invert sugar,\r\nand calls attention to the detailed experiments he has made which\r\nresulted in the determination of the laws of the variation. From these\r\nstudies he was able to construct a table of corrections, applicable in\r\nthe analysis of all saccharine substances in which the cane sugar is\r\npolarized before and after inversion. The basis of the law rests upon\r\nthe observation that a solution of pure sugar, polarizing 100° on the\r\nsugar scale, before inversion, will polarize 44° to the left after\r\ninversion at a temperature of zero. The quantity of sugar operated upon\r\nby Clerget amounted to 16.471 grams in 100 cubic centimeters of liquid.\r\nOn the instrument employed by him this quantity of sugar in 100 cubic\r\ncentimeters gave a reading of 100° to the right on the sugar scale\r\nwhen contained in a tube twenty centimeters in length. The process of\r\ninversion carried on by Clerget is as follows:\r\n\r\nThe sugar solution is placed in a flask, marked on the neck at 100\r\nand 110 cubic centimeters; or if smaller quantities are used, in a\r\nflask marked on the neck at fifty and fifty-five cubic centimeters.\r\nThe flask is filled with the sugar solution to the first mark and\r\nthen a sufficient quantity of strong hydrochloric acid added to bring\r\nthe volume of the liquid to the second mark. The mouth of the flask\r\nis then closed with the thumb and its contents thoroughly mixed by\r\nshaking. A thermometer is placed in the flask which is set in a\r\nwater-bath in such a way that the water comes just above the level of\r\nthe liquid in the neck of the flask. The water is heated in such a\r\nmanner as to bring the temperature of the contents of the flask, as\r\ndetermined by the thermometer, exactly to 68° and at such a rate as to\r\nrequire fifteen minutes to reach this result. At the end of fifteen\r\nminutes the temperature having reached 68° the flask is removed and\r\nplaced at once in another water-bath at the temperature of the room,\r\nto which temperature the contents of the flask are cooled as rapidly\r\nas possible. To make the polarimetric observation a tube twenty-two\r\ncentimeters in length is filled with the inverted sugar solution by\r\nmeans of a tubulure in its center, which serves not only the purpose of\r\nfilling the tube but also afterwards to carry the thermometer, by means\r\nof which the temperature of observation can be taken. If the sugar\r\nsolution be turbid, or contain any lead chlorid due to the previous use\r\nof basic lead acetate in clarification, it should be filtered before\r\nbeing introduced into the observation tube. This tube being one-tenth\r\nlonger than the original compensates for the dilution caused by the\r\naddition of the hydrochloric acid in inversion.\r\n\r\nWhen reading, the bulb of the thermometer should be withdrawn far\r\nenough to permit the free passage of the ray of light and the exact\r\ntemperature of the solution noted.\r\n\r\nThe above outline of Clerget’s method of inversion is given in order\r\nthat the analyst may compare it with any of the variations which he may\r\nfind in other works. The chief points to which attention is called,\r\nare, first, the fact that only a little over sixteen grams of sugar are\r\nused for ten cubic centimeters of strong hydrochloric acid, and second,\r\nthat the time of heating is exactly fifteen minutes, during which time\r\nthe contents of the flask should be raised from room temperature to\r\nexactly 68°.\r\n\r\nFrom the above it is seen that the process of Clerget, as originally\r\ndescribed, can be applied directly to all instruments, using\r\napproximately sixteen grams of sugar in 100 cubic centimeters.\r\nExperience has also shown that even when larger quantities of sugar\r\nare employed, as for instance, approximately twenty-six grams,\r\nthe inversion is effected with practical completeness in the same\r\ncircumstances. It is advised, therefore, that in all analytical\r\nprocesses, in which cane sugar is to be determined by the process of\r\ninversion with an acid, the original directions of Clerget be followed\r\nas strictly as possible. Experience has shown that no one of the\r\nvariations proposed for Clerget’s original method has any practical\r\nadvantage and the analyst is especially cautioned against those\r\nmethods of inversion in which the temperature is continued at 68° for\r\nfifteen minutes or in which it is allowed to go above that degree.\r\n\r\n=93. Influence of Strength of Solution and Time of Heating on the\r\nInversion of Sucrose.=—As has been intimated, the strength of a sugar\r\nsolution and the time of heating with hydrochloric acid are factors\r\nthat must be considered in determining a formula for the calculation\r\nof sucrose by inversion. The Clerget formula holds good only for the\r\nconditions specified and these conditions must be rigidly adhered to\r\nin order to secure the proper results. This matter has been thoroughly\r\nstudied by Bornträger, who also gives a nearly complete bibliography\r\nof the subject.[54] As a result of his investigations it seems\r\nwell established that the original Clerget formula is practically\r\ncorrect for the conditions indicated, Bornträger modifying it only\r\nby substituting in the formula 143.66 for 144. This is so nearly the\r\nsame as the Clerget factor that it is not advisable to substitute it\r\ntherefor. If, however, the inverted sugar solution be diluted to double\r\nits volume before polarization the factor proposed by Landolt, _viz._,\r\n142.4, gives more nearly accurate results. If the hydrochloric acid be\r\nneutralized before polarization by an alkaline body, the character of\r\nthe salt which is formed also influences, to a greater or less extent,\r\nthe specific rotatory power of the solution. Hydrochloric acid itself\r\nalso influences the rotation to a certain degree.[55]\r\n\r\n=94. Calculation of Results.=—The percentage of sucrose in a solution\r\nwhich has been polarized before and after inversion is calculated by an\r\nappropriate formula from the data obtained or is taken directly from\r\ntables. These tables are too long to insert here, and in point of fact\r\nthe calculation can be made from the formula almost as quickly as the\r\nresult can be taken from a table.\r\n\r\nTwo factors are commonly used in the calculations, one based on\r\nthe supposition that a sugar solution polarizing 100° to the right\r\nwill, after inversion, give a reading of 44° to the left, at zero\r\ntemperature. In the second formula in common use the polarization to\r\nthe left in the circumstances mentioned above is assumed to be 42.4, a\r\nnumber reached by Landolt after a long series of experiments.[56] The\r\nprinciple of the calculation of the percentage of sucrose is based upon\r\nthe original observation of Clerget to the effect that the algebraic\r\ndifference of the two readings, divided by 144, less half of the\r\ntemperature, will give the percentage of sucrose desired. The formula\r\nby which this is obtained is\r\n\r\n           _a_ - _b_\r\n    _S_ = -----------.\r\n           _K_ - _t_\r\n                 ----\r\n                   2\r\n\r\nIn this formula _a_ is the polarization on the sugar scale before\r\ninversion, _b_ the polarization after inversion, _K_ the constant\r\nrepresenting the algebraic difference of the two polarizations of\r\npure sugar at 0° and _t_ the temperature of the observation. To _K_\r\nmay be assigned the values 144 or 142.4, the one in more common use.\r\nIn case the polarization, after inversion, is to the left, which is\r\nmore commonly the case, the sum of the two readings is taken for\r\n_a_ - (-_b_) = _a_ + _b_; when both polarizations are to the right\r\nor left the difference is taken. S is the percentage of sucrose desired.\r\n\r\n    _Example.—_Let the polarization before inversion be   +95\r\n                                   and after inversion     -26\r\n                                   and the temperature      20°\r\n\r\n               95 + 26\r\n    Then _S_= -------- = 121 ÷ 134 = 90.6.\r\n              144 - 10\r\n\r\nSubstituting the value 142.4 for _K_, the result of the calculation is\r\n91.4.\r\n\r\nIn high grade sugars, therefore, the difference in the results secured\r\nby taking the two values of _K_ amounts to about 1 per cent of sucrose.\r\n\r\nFor a further discussion of the theory and practice of inversion the\r\nreader is referred to the articles of Herles, Herzfeld, and Wohl.[57]\r\n\r\n=95. Method Of Lindet.=—Courtonne recommends the method of Lindet for\r\nsecuring the inversion instead of the method of Clerget.[58] Modified\r\nby Courtonne, the method is as follows:\r\n\r\nMake two or three times the normal weight of sugar dissolved in water\r\nto a volume of 200 or 300 cubic centimeters, as the case may be. After\r\nthoroughly mixing proceed as follows:\r\n\r\n_First, to Obtain the Polarization Direct._—Place fifty or 100 cubic\r\ncentimeters of the prepared solution in a flask marked at fifty and\r\nfifty-five or at 100 and 110 cubic centimeters, add a sufficient\r\nquantity of lead acetate to secure a complete clarification, make\r\nthe volume to fifty-five or 110 cubic centimeters, shake thoroughly,\r\nfilter, and polarize in a 220 millimeter tube.\r\n\r\n_Second, to Obtain the Rotation after Inversion._—Place twenty cubic\r\ncentimeters of the original solution, in a flask marked at fifty cubic\r\ncentimeters, containing five grams of powdered zinc. The flask should\r\nbe placed in boiling water. Add, little by little so as to avoid a too\r\nrapid evolution of hydrogen, ten cubic centimeters of hydrochloric\r\nacid made of equal parts of the strongest acid and water. After the\r\noperation is terminated, cool to the temperature of the room, make\r\nthe volume to fifty cubic centimeters, polarize, and determine the\r\nrotation. The volume occupied by the zinc which is not dissolved, will\r\nbe about one-half cubic centimeter, hence the deviation should be\r\nmultiplied by the factor 2.475 in order to get the true deviation which\r\nwould have been produced by the pure liquor. We have then:\r\n\r\n    _A_ = the deviation direct.\r\n    _B_ = the deviation after inversion.\r\n    _C_ = the algebraic difference of the deviations.\r\n\r\nThe amount of sucrose, therefore, would be calculated by the formula of\r\nCreydt,[59]\r\n\r\n          _C_ - 0.493_A_\r\n    _X_ = --------------;\r\n            0.827\r\n\r\n\r\nfor raffinose the formula would be\r\n\r\n           _A_ - _S_\r\n    _Y_ =  ---------,\r\n             1.57\r\n\r\nin which _S_ is the deviation due to the sucrose present. The solutions\r\ninverted in the manner described are absolutely colorless. There is no\r\nneed of employing bone-black to secure the saccharimetric reading nor\r\ndoes it present any uncertainty. It is thought by Courtonne that this\r\nmethod will soon take the place of the method of Clerget on account of\r\nthe advantages above mentioned. The method will be somewhat improved by\r\nadopting the following suggestions:\r\n\r\n1. Instead of allowing any arbitrary number for the volume of the\r\nundissolved zinc, decant the liquid, after inversion, into another\r\nflask and wash repeatedly with hot water until all trace of sugar is\r\nremoved from the flask in which the inversion took place.\r\n\r\n2. Instead of polarizing in a 200 millimeter tube make the observation\r\nin a 500 millimeter tube, which will permit of the reading being made\r\nwithout any correction whatever.\r\n\r\n=96. Inversion by Means of Invertase.=—Instead of using acids for the\r\ninversion of cane sugar the hydrolysis can be easily effected by means\r\nof a ferment derived from yeast. A complete history of the literature\r\nand characteristics of this ferment, together with a study of its\r\nproperties and the various methods of preparing it, has been given by\r\nO’Sullivan and Tompson.[60] In the preparation of invertase, the method\r\nfound most effective is the following:\r\n\r\nThe yeast is allowed to liquify for at least a month in a fairly warm\r\nroom without stirring. At the end of this time the surface is removed\r\nand any supernatant liquid poured away. The lower sedimentary part is\r\nthrown on a quick-acting filter and allowed to drain for two days.\r\nTo the filtrate, alcohol of specific gravity 0.87 is gradually added\r\nto the extent of one and a half times its volume, with continued and\r\nvigorous stirring. The process of adding the alcohol and stirring\r\nshould require about half an hour, after which the mixture is allowed\r\nto stand for twenty-four hours to allow the precipitated invertase\r\nto settle. The supernatant liquid is poured away and the precipitate\r\nwashed several times on successive days by decantation with alcohol of\r\n0.92 specific gravity. When the washings become nearly colorless the\r\nprecipitate is thrown on a filter, allowed to drain, and immediately\r\nremoved and mixed with a large bulk of alcohol of 0.92 specific\r\ngravity. The precipitate is again collected, mixed thoroughly with its\r\nown bulk of water, and some alcohol of 0.97 specific gravity, allowed\r\nto stand for a few hours and thrown on a filter. The filtrate contains\r\nthe invertase.\r\n\r\n=97. Determination of Activity of Invertase.=—The activity of a\r\nsolution of invertase, prepared as above, is measured by the number\r\nof minutes required for it to reduce to zero the optical power of a\r\nsolution of 100 times its weight of cane sugar at a temperature of\r\n15°.5. In order to facilitate the action of the invertase, a trace of\r\nsulfuric acid is added to the solution. The manipulation is as follows:\r\n\r\nFifty grams of sucrose are dissolved in water and made to a volume of\r\nnearly a quarter of a liter and placed in a bath maintained at 15°.5.\r\nHalf a gram of the invertase is added, the time noted, the solution\r\nimmediately made up to a quarter of a liter and well shaken. The\r\ncontents of the flask are poured rapidly into five beakers; the actual\r\nquantity in each beaker is not necessarily the same. To each of these\r\nbeakers, in succession, are added the following amounts of decinormal\r\nsulfuric acid, _viz._, one-tenth, three-tenths, six-tenths, one, and\r\none and four-tenths cubic centimeters. After an hour a small quantity\r\nof the solution is taken from beaker No. 3 and the reaction of the\r\ninvertase stopped by adding a few drops of strong potassium hydroxid\r\nand the time of adding this reagent noted. This solution is then read\r\nin the polariscope and the percentage of sugar inverted is calculated\r\nfrom the formula C₁₂H₂₂O₁₁ + H₂O = C₆H₁₂O₆ + C₆H₁₂O₆.\r\n\r\nThe calculation of the amount of cane sugar inverted is based on\r\nthe formula, (38.4 - _d_) ÷ 0.518 = _p_. In this formula _d_ equals\r\nthe divisions of the sugar scale read on the polariscope; _p_ the\r\npercentage of cane sugar inverted; 38.4 the reading on the sugar scale\r\nof the original sugar solution and 51.8 the total number of divisions\r\nof the cane sugar scale that the polariscope reading would fall through\r\nif all the sugar were inverted. The observation tubes used in the\r\npolarization are only 100 millimeters in length. After stopping the\r\naction of the invertase with potassium hydroxid the solution is allowed\r\nto stand for some time before polarization inasmuch as the dextrose\r\nformed appears to assume the state of birotation and some time is\r\nrequired for it to reach its normal rotatory power. If the invertase\r\nbe used in the alcoholic solution a sufficient quantity should be\r\nadded to be equivalent to 0.01 of the sucrose present. The time which\r\nthe contents of beaker No. 3 will take to reach optical activity is\r\ncalculated in a manner described by O’Sullivan and Tompson, but too\r\nlong to be inserted here.[61] The five beakers mentioned above are\r\nexamined in succession and the amount of sulfuric acid best suited to\r\nthe maximum inversion thus determined. This quantity is then used in\r\nsubsequent hydrolyses with the given sample of invertase.\r\n\r\nThe action of invertase on sucrose is very rapid at the first and\r\nbecomes very much slower towards the end. At a temperature of 15°.5 it\r\nis advisable to let the solution stand for forty-eight hours in order\r\nto be sure that complete inversion has taken place. For this reason\r\nthe method by inversion by means of invertase is one of no great\r\npractical importance, but it may often be useful to the analyst when\r\nthe employment of an acid is inadmissible.\r\n\r\n=98. Inversion by Yeast.=—Owing to the difficulty of preparing\r\ninvertase, O’Sullivan and Thompson[62] propose to use yeast as the\r\nhydrolytic agent, as first suggested by Kjeldahl. It is shown that in\r\nthe use of yeast it is not necessary to employ thymol or any other\r\nantiseptic. The method of procedure is as follows: The cane sugar\r\nsolution of usual strength should not be alkaline, but, if possible,\r\nshould be exactly neutral. If there be any ferment suspected, the\r\ntemperature should be momentarily raised to 80° to destroy its\r\nactivity. The polariscopic reading of the solution is then taken at\r\n15°.5 and the amount of copper reduced by the solution should also be\r\ndetermined.\r\n\r\nFifty cubic centimeters of the solution are poured into a beaker and\r\nraised to a temperature of 55° in a constant temperature bath. Some\r\nbrewers yeast amounting to about one-tenth of the total amount of sugar\r\nto be inverted, pressed in a towel, is thrown into the hot solution and\r\nthe whole stirred until mixture is complete. The solution is left for\r\nfour hours in the water-bath, at the end of this time it is cooled to\r\n15°.5, a little freshly precipitated aluminum hydroxid added, and the\r\nvolume made to 100 cubic centimeters. A portion of this solution is\r\nfiltered and its polariscopic reading observed. The solution is then\r\nleft till the next day, when another polariscopic reading is taken in\r\norder to prove that inversion is complete. The copper reducing power is\r\nalso determined. The method of calculating the results is the same as\r\nwhen invertase is used. The following formulas are employed.\r\n\r\n_a_ = the number of divisions indicated by the polariscopic reading for\r\na 200 millimeter tube:\r\n\r\n_aʹ_ = the same number after inversion:\r\n\r\n_m_ = the number of the divisions of the polariscopic scale which 200\r\nmillimeters of the sugar solution containing one gram of cane sugar\r\nper 100, alter at 15°.5 on being inverted: In the case of the ventzke\r\npolarimeter scale, one gram of cane sugar in 100 cubic centimeters,\r\nindicates +3.84 divisions and after inversion it gives -1.34 div. In\r\nexperiments of this kind, therefore, _m_ = 5.18.\r\n\r\n_P_ = the weight of cane sugar present in 100 cubic centimeters of the\r\noriginal solution:\r\n\r\nThe formula employed then is\r\n\r\n          _a_ - 2_a_ʹ\r\n    _P_ = -----------.\r\n             _m_\r\n\r\nFor the copper reduction data the following are used:\r\n\r\n_G_ = the weight of 100 cubic centimeters of the original solution:\r\n\r\n_Gʹ;_ = the same for the inverted solution: Allowance must be made here\r\nboth for the dilution and for the 5 per cent increase of the inverted\r\nsugar, but the latter number is so small that it need not be calculated\r\naccurately.\r\n\r\n_w_ = the weight of the original solution used for the estimation:\r\n\r\n_wʹ_ = the same factor for the inverted solution:\r\n\r\n_k_ = the weight of cupric oxid reduced by _w_:\r\n\r\n_kʹ_ = the same factor for _wʹ_:\r\n\r\n_p_ = the weight of cane sugar present in 100 cubic centimeters of the\r\noriginal solution: The formula to be employed then is\r\n\r\n                   _Gʹ kʹ    G k_\r\n    _p_ = 0.4308(2 ------ - -----).\r\n                     _wʹ      w_\r\n\r\nThis method has been applied to the estimation of cane sugar in\r\nmolasses, apple juices and other substances. It is recommended by the\r\nauthors as a simple and accurate means of estimating sucrose in all\r\nsolutions containing it. The methods of making the copper reductions\r\nwill be given hereafter.\r\n\r\n=99. Application of the Process.=—In practice the process of inversion\r\nis used chiefly in the analysis of molasses and low grade massecuites.\r\nIn approximately pure sugars the direct polarization is sufficiently\r\naccurate for all practical purposes. In molasses resulting from the\r\nmanufacture of beet sugar are often found considerable quantities of\r\nraffinose, and the inversion process has been adapted to that character\r\nof samples. In molasses, in sugar cane factories, the disturbing\r\nfactors are chiefly invert sugars and gums. The processes used for\r\nmolasses will be given in another paragraph. In certain determinations\r\nof lactose the process of inversion is also practiced, but in this\r\ncase the lactose is converted into dextrose and galactose, and the\r\nfactors of calculation are altogether different. The process has also\r\nbeen adapted by McElroy and Bigelow to the determination of sucrose in\r\npresence of lactose, and this method will be described further on. In\r\ngeneral the process of inversion is applicable to the determination of\r\nsucrose in all mixtures of other optically active bodies, which are not\r\naffected by the methods of inversion employed.\r\n\r\n=100. Determination of Sucrose and Raffinose.=—Raffinose is a sugar\r\nwhich often occurs in beets, and is found chiefly in the molasses after\r\nthe chief part of the sucrose has been removed by crystallization. It\r\nis also found in many seeds, notably in those of the cotton plant. In a\r\npure solution of sucrose and raffinose, both sugars may be determined\r\nby the inversion method of Creydt.[63] The inversion is effected by\r\nmeans of hydrochloric acid in the manner described by Clerget. The\r\nfollowing formulas are calculated for a temperature of observation\r\nof 20°, and the readings should be made as near that temperature as\r\npossible.\r\n\r\n              _C_ - 0.493_A_\r\n    (1) _S_ = --------------\r\n                0.827\r\n\r\n              _A_ - _S_                6\r\n    (2) _R_ = --------- = 1.017_A_ - ------.\r\n                 1.57                 1.298\r\n\r\nIn these formulas _S_ and _R_ are the respective per cents of sucrose\r\nand raffinose desired, _A_ the polarization in sugar degrees before\r\ninversion, _B_ the polarization after inversion read at 20°, and _C_\r\nis the algebraic difference between _A_ and _B_. It must be understood\r\nthat these formulas are applicable only to a solution containing no\r\nother optically active substances, save sucrose and raffinose.\r\n\r\n=101. Specific Rotatory Power.=—In order to compare among themselves\r\nthe rotations produced on a plane of polarized light by different\r\noptically active bodies in solution, it is convenient to refer them all\r\nto an assumed standard. The degree of rotation which the body would\r\nshow in this condition, is found by calculation, since, in reality,\r\nthe conditions assumed are never found in practice. In the case of\r\nsugars and other optically active bodies, the standard of comparison\r\nis called the specific rotatory power. This factor in any given case,\r\nis the angular rotation which would be produced by any given substance\r\nin a pure anhydrous state if it were one decimeter in length and of a\r\nspecific gravity equal to water. These are conditions which evidently\r\ndo not exist in the case of sugars, since crystalline sugar particles\r\nhave no polarizing power, and it would be impossible to pass a ray\r\nof light through an amorphous sugar column of the length specified.\r\nThe specific rotatory power is therefore to be regarded as a purely\r\ntheoretical factor, calculated from the actual data obtained by the\r\nexamination of the solution of any given substance. If the length\r\nof the observation tube in decimeters be represented by _l_, the\r\npercentage of the polarizing body in 100 grams by _p_, and the specific\r\ngravity of the solution by _d_, and the observed angle of rotation by\r\n_a_, then the factor is calculated from the formula:\r\n\r\n                    _a_. 100\r\n    [_a_]_{Dj} = ---------------.\r\n                  _p_. _d_. _l_.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe symbols Dj refer to the character of light employed, D indicating\r\nthe monochromatic sodium flame, and j the transition tint from white\r\nlight.\r\n\r\nIf the weight of the polarizing body _c_ be given or known for 100\r\ncubic centimeters of the solution the formula becomes\r\n\r\n                  _a_. 100\r\n    [_a_]_{Dj} = ----------.\r\n                  _c_. _l_.\r\n\r\nThe latter formula is the one easier of application since it is only\r\nnecessary in applying it to dissolve a given weight of the active body\r\nin an appropriate solvent and to complete the volume of the solution\r\nexactly to 100 cubic centimeters. It is therefore unnecessary in this\r\ncase to determine the specific gravity.\r\n\r\n=102. Formulas for Calculating Specific Rotatory Power.=—In order\r\nto determine the specific rotatory power (gyrodynat[64]) of a given\r\nsubstance it is necessary to know the specific gravity and percentage\r\ncomposition or concentration of its solution, and to examine it with\r\nmonochromatic polarized light in an instrument by which the angular\r\nrotation can be measured. The gyrodynat of any body changes with its\r\ndegree of concentration, in some cases with the temperature, and\r\nalways with the color of the light. With the red rays the gyrodynat\r\nis least and itprogressively increases as the violet end of the\r\nspectrum is approached. In practice the yellow ray of the spectrum\r\nhas been found most convenient for use, and in the case of sugars\r\nthe gyrodynat is always expressed either in terms of this ray or if\r\nmade with color compensating instruments in terms of the sensitive or\r\ntransition tint. In the one case the symbol used is (_a_)_{D} and in\r\nthe other (_a_)_{j}. From this statement it follows that (_a_)_{D} is\r\nalways numerically less than (_a_)_{j}. Unless otherwise specified\r\nthe gyrodynat of a body is to be considered as determined by yellow\r\nmonochromatic light, and therefore corresponds to _a__{D}.[65]\r\n\r\n=103. Variations in Specific Rotatory Power.=—The gyrodynat of any\r\noptically active body varies with the nature of the solvent, the\r\nstrength of the solution, and the temperature.[66]\r\n\r\nSince water is the only solvent of importance in determining the\r\ngyrodynat of sugars it will not be necessary here to discuss the\r\ninfluence of the nature of the solvent. In respect of the strength of\r\nthe solution it has been established that in the case of cane sugar the\r\ngyrodynat decreases while with dextrose it increases with the degree\r\nof concentration. The influence of temperature on the gyrodynat of\r\ncommon sugars is not of great importance save in the case of levulose,\r\nwhere it is the most important factor, the gyrodynat rapidly increasing\r\nas the temperature falls. It is of course understood that the above\r\nremarks do not apply to the increase or decrease in the volume of a\r\nsolution at changed temperatures. This influence of temperature is\r\nuniversally proportional to the change of volume in all cases, and\r\nthis volumetric change is completely eliminated when the polarizations\r\nare made at the temperatures at which the solutions are completed to\r\nstandard volumes.\r\n\r\n=104. Gyrodynatic Data for Common Sugars.=—In the case of cane sugar\r\nthe gyrodynat for twenty-five grams of sugar in 100 grams of solution\r\nat 20° is [_a_]_{D} = 66°.37. This is about the degree of concentration\r\nof the solutions employed in the shadow lamplight polariscopes. For\r\nseventeen grams of sugar in 100 grams of solution the number is\r\n[_a_]_{D} = 66°.49. This is approximately the degree of concentration\r\nfor the laurent instrument.\r\n\r\nFor any degree of concentration according to Tollens the gyrodynat may\r\nbe computed by the following formula: [_a_]_{D} = 66°.386 + 0.015035_p_\r\n- 0.0003986_p_², in which _p_ is the number of grams of sugar in 100\r\ngrams of the solution.[67] In the table constructed by Schmitt the data\r\nobtained are as follows:\r\n\r\n    In 100 parts by weight  Specific                   Rotation _a_\r\n         of solution.        gravity     Concentration for 100 mm.\r\n    Sugar _p_.

Bi-Rotation.=—Some sugars in fresh solution show a gyrodynat\r\nmuch higher than the normal, sometimes lower. The former phenomenon\r\nis called bi- the latter semi-rotation. Dextrose shows birotation in\r\na marked degree, also maltose and lactose. After standing for a few\r\nhours, or immediately on boiling, solutions of these sugars assume\r\ntheir normal state of rotation. The addition of a small quantity of\r\nammonia also causes the birotation to disappear.[68] This phenomenon\r\nis doubtless due to a certain molecular taxis, which remains after\r\nsolution is apparently complete. The groups of molecules thus held in\r\nplace have a certain rotatory power of their own and this is superadded\r\nto that of the normal solution. After a time, under the stress of the\r\naction of the solvent, these groups are broken up and the solution then\r\nassumes its normal condition.\r\n\r\n=106. Gyrodynat of Dextrose.=—The gyrodynat of dextrose, as has already\r\nbeen mentioned, increases with the degree of concentration, thus\r\nshowing a property directly opposite that of sucrose.\r\n\r\nThe general formula for the anhydrous sugar is [_a_]_{D} = 52.°718 +\r\n0.017087_p_ + 0.0004271_p_². In this formula _p_ represents the grams\r\nof dextrose in 100 grams of the solution. In a ten per cent solution\r\nthe gyrodynat of dextrose is therefore nearly exactly [_a_]_{D}20° =\r\n53°. As calculated by Tollens the gyrodynats corresponding to several\r\ndegrees of concentration are shown in the following table:\r\n\r\n    _p_ = grams in 100        [_a_]_{D}20° calculated for\r\n    grams of solution.        anhydrous dextrose.\r\n       7.6819                    52°.89\r\n       9.2994                    52°.94\r\n       9.3712                    52°.94\r\n      10.0614                    52°.96\r\n      10.6279                    52°.98\r\n      12.9508                    53°.05\r\n      18.6211                    53°.25\r\n      31.6139                    53°.83\r\n      40.7432                    54°.34\r\n      43.9883                    54°.54\r\n      53.0231                    55°.17\r\n      82.6111                    57°.80\r\n\r\n=107. Gyrodynats of Other Sugars.=—Of the other sugars it will be\r\nsufficient to mention only levulose, maltose, lactose, and raffinose.\r\nFor complete tables of gyrodynatic powers the standard books on\r\ncarbohydrates may be consulted.[69]\r\n\r\nThe gyrodynat of levulose is not definitely established. At 14° the\r\nnumber is nearly expressed by [_a_]_{D}14° = -93°.7.\r\n\r\nInvert sugar, which should consist of exactly equal molecules of\r\ndextrose and levulose, has a gyrodynat expressed by the formula\r\n[_a_]_{D}0° = -27°.9, with a concentration equivalent to 17.21 grams of\r\nsugar in 100 cubic centimeters. The gyrodynat decreases with increase\r\nof temperature, according to the formula [_a_]_{D}_t_° = -(27°.9\r\n- 0.32_t_°). According to this formula the solution is neutral to\r\npolarized light at 87°.2, and this corresponds closely to the data of\r\nexperiment.\r\n\r\nMaltose, in a ten per cent solution at 20°, shows a gyrodynat of\r\n[_a_]_{D}20° = 138°.3.\r\n\r\nThe general formula for other degrees of concentration is [_a_]_{D} =\r\n140°.375 - 0.01837_p_ - 0.095_t_, in which _p_ represents the number\r\nof grams in 100 grams of the solution and _t_ the temperature of\r\nobservation.\r\n\r\nIn the case of lactose [_a_]_{D} = 52°.53, and this number does not\r\nappear to be greatly influenced by the degree of concentration; but is\r\nsomewhat diminished by a rising temperature.\r\n\r\nThe gyrodynat of raffinose in a ten per cent solution is [_a_]_{D} =\r\n104°.5.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHEMICAL METHODS OF ESTIMATING SUGARS.\r\n\r\n=108. General Principles.=—The methods for the chemical estimation of\r\nsugars in common use depend on the reducing actions exerted on certain\r\nmetallic salts, whereby the metal itself or some oxid thereof, is\r\nobtained. The reaction is either volumetric or the resulting oxid or\r\nmetal may be weighed. The common method is, therefore, resolved into\r\ntwo distinct processes, and each of these is carried out in several\r\nways. Not all sugars have the faculty of exerting a reducing action\r\non highly oxidized metallic salts and the most common of them all,\r\n_viz._, sucrose is practically without action. This sugar, however, by\r\nsimple hydrolysis, becomes reducing, but the two components into which\r\nit is resolved by hydrolytic action do not reduce metallic salts in\r\nthe same proportion. Moreover, in all cases the reducing power of a\r\nsugar solution is largely dependent on its degree of concentration, and\r\nthis factor must always be taken into consideration. Salts of copper\r\nand mercury are most usually selected to measure the reducing power\r\nof a sugar and in point of fact copper salts are almost universally\r\nused. Copper sulfate and carbonate are the salts usually employed, and\r\nof these the sulfate far more frequently, but after conversion into\r\ntartrate. Practically, therefore, the study of the reducing action of\r\nsugar as an analytical method will be confined almost exclusively to\r\nthe determination of its action on copper tartrate.\r\n\r\nDirect gravimetric methods are also practiced to a limited extent in\r\nthe determination of sugars as in the use of the formation of sucrates\r\nof the alkaline earths and of the combinations which certain sugars\r\nform with phenylhydrazin. Within a few years this last named reaction\r\nhas assumed a marked degree of importance as an analytical method.\r\nThe most practical treatment of this section, therefore, for the\r\nlimited space which can be given it, will be the study of the reducing\r\naction of sugars, both from a volumetric and gravimetric point of\r\nview, followed by a description of the best approved methods of the\r\ndirect precipitation of sugars by such reagents as barium hydroxid and\r\nphenylhydrazin.\r\n\r\n\r\nVOLUMETRIC METHODS.\r\n\r\n=109. Classification.=—Among the volumetric methods will be given those\r\nwhich are in common use or such as have been approved by the practice\r\nof analysts. Since the use of mercuric salts is now practiced to a\r\nlimited extent, only a brief study of that process will be attempted.\r\nWith the copper methods a somewhat extended description will be given\r\nof those depending on the use of copper sulfate, and a briefer account\r\nof the copper carbonate process.\r\n\r\nIn the copper sulfate method two distinct divisions must be noted,\r\n_viz._, first an indirect process depending first upon the reduction\r\nof the copper to a suboxid, the subsequent action of this body on iron\r\nsalts, measured finally by titration with potassium permanganate; and\r\nsecond, a direct process determined either by the disappearance of the\r\nblue color from the copper solution, or by the absence of copper from a\r\ndrop of the solution withdrawn and tested with potassium ferrocyanid.\r\nThis last mentioned reaction is one which is found in common use. The\r\nvolumetric methods are not, as a rule, as accurate as the gravimetric,\r\ndepending on weighing the resultant metal, but they are far more rapid\r\nand well suited to technical control determinations.\r\n\r\n=110. Reduction of Mercuric Salts.=—The method of determining sugar by\r\nits action on mercuric salts, is due to Knapp.[70] The method is based\r\non the observation that dextrose and other allied sugars, will reduce\r\nan alkaline solution of mercuric cyanid, and that the mercury will\r\nappear in a metallic state.\r\n\r\nThe mercuric liquor is prepared by adding to a solution of ten grams of\r\nmercuric cyanid, 100 cubic centimeters of a solution of caustic soda of\r\n1.145 specific gravity, and making the volume to one liter with water.\r\nThe solution of sugar to be titrated, should be as nearly as possible\r\nof one per cent strength.\r\n\r\nTo 100 cubic centimeters of the boiling solution, the sugar solution is\r\nadded in small portions from a burette and in such a way as to keep the\r\nwhole mass in gentle ebullition.\r\n\r\nTo determine when all the mercuric salt has been decomposed, a drop of\r\nthe clear boiling liquid is removed and brought into contact with a\r\ndrop of stannous chlorid solution on a white surface. A brownish black\r\ncoloration or precipitate will indicate that the mercury is not all\r\nprecipitated. Fresh portions of the sugar must then be added, until no\r\nfurther indication of the presence of mercury is noted. The approximate\r\nquantity of sugar solution required to precipitate the mercury having\r\nthus been determined, the process is repeated by adding rapidly, nearly\r\nthe quantity of sugar solution required, and then only a few drops at a\r\ntime, until the reduction is complete.\r\n\r\nOne hundred cubic centimeters of the mercuric cyanid solution prepared\r\nas directed above, will be completely reduced by\r\n\r\n    202 milligrams of dextrose,\r\n    200   ”   ” invert sugar,\r\n    198   ”   ” levulose,\r\n    308   ”   ” maltose,\r\n    311   ”   ” lactose.\r\n\r\nBy reason of the unpleasant odor of the boiling mercuric cyanid when\r\nin presence of a reducing agent, the process should be conducted in a\r\nwell ventilated fume chamber. With a little practice the process is\r\ncapable of rapid execution, and gives reasonably accurate results.\r\n\r\n=111. Sachsse’s Solution.=—The solution of mercuric salts proposed\r\nby Sachsse, is made by dissolving eighteen grams of mercuric iodid\r\nin twenty-five cubic centimeters of an aqueous solution of potassium\r\niodid. To this solution are added 200 cubic centimeters of potash lye,\r\ncontaining eighty grams of caustic potash. After mixing the solution,\r\nthe volume is completed to one liter. The sugar solutions used to\r\nreduce this mixture, should be more dilute than those employed with\r\nthe mercuric cyanid, and should not be over one-half per cent in\r\nstrength. The end of the reduction is determined as already described.\r\nAfter a preliminary trial, nearly all the sugar necessary to complete\r\nreduction, should be added at once, and the end of the reduction then\r\ndetermined by the addition of successive small quantities. One hundred\r\ncubic centimeters of the mercuric iodid solution prepared as directed\r\nabove, require the following quantities of sugar to effect a complete\r\nreduction:\r\n\r\n    325 milligrams of dextrose,\r\n    269   ”   ” invert sugar,\r\n    213   ”   ” levulose,\r\n    491   ”   ” maltose,\r\n    387   ”   ” lactose.\r\n\r\nBy reason of the great difference between the reducing power of\r\ndextrose and levulose in this solution, it has been used in combination\r\nwith the copper reduction method, to be described, to determine the\r\nrelative proportion of dextrose and levulose in a mixture.[71]\r\n\r\nIt is now known that copper solutions require slightly different\r\nquantities of dextrose, levulose, or invert sugar to effect complete\r\nreduction, but the variations are not great and in the calculation\r\nabove mentioned, it may be assumed that these differences do not exist.\r\n\r\nInstead of using stannous chlorid as an indicator, the end of the\r\nreaction may be determined as follows: A disk of filtering paper is\r\nplaced over a small beaker containing some ammonium sulfid. A drop of\r\nthe clear hot solution is placed on this disk, and if salts of mercury\r\nbe still present a dark stain will be produced; or a drop of the\r\nammonium sulfid may be brought near the moist spot formed by the drop\r\nof mercury salt. An alkaline solution of zinc oxid may also be used.\r\n\r\nThe methods depending on the use of mercuric salts have, of late, been\r\nsupplanted by better processes, and space will not be given here to\r\ntheir further discussion.\r\n\r\n=112. The Volumetric Copper Methods.=—The general principle on which\r\nthese methods depend, is found in the fact that certain sugars,\r\nnotably, dextrose, (glucose), levulose, (fructose), maltose and\r\nlactose, have the property of reducing an alkaline solution of copper\r\nto a lower state of combination, in which the copper is separated as\r\ncuprous oxid. The end of the reaction is either determined by the\r\ndisappearance of the blue color of the solution, or by the reaction\r\nproduced by a drop of the hot filtered solution, when placed in contact\r\nwith a drop of potassium ferrocyanid acidified with acetic.\r\n\r\nThe copper salt which is found to give the most delicate and reliable\r\nreaction, is the tartrate. The number of volumetric processes proposed\r\nand which are in use, is very great, and an attempt even to enumerate\r\nall of these can not be made in this volume. A few of the most reliable\r\nand best attested methods will be given, representing if possible, the\r\nbest practice in this and other countries. The rate of reduction of\r\nthe copper salt to suboxid, is influenced by the rate of mixing with\r\nthe sugar solutions, the temperature, the composition of the copper\r\nsolution and the strength of the sugar solution.\r\n\r\nThe degree of reduction is also modified by the rate at which the\r\nsugar solution is added, and by the degree and duration of heating,\r\nand all these variables together, make the volumetric methods somewhat\r\ndifficult and their data, to a certain extent, discordant. By reason,\r\nhowever, of the ease with which they are applied and the speed of their\r\nexecution, they are invaluable for approximately correct work and for\r\nuse in technical control.\r\n\r\n=113. Historical.=—It is not the purpose in this paragraph to trace\r\nthe development of the copper reduction method for the determination\r\nof reducing sugars, but only to refer to the beginning of the exact\r\nanalytical application of it.\r\n\r\nPeligot, as early as 1844, made a report to the Society for the\r\nEncouragement of National Industry on methods proposed by Barreswil\r\nand Fromherz for the quantitive estimation of sugar by means of copper\r\nsolution.[72] These methods were based on the property of certain\r\nsugars to reduce alkaline copper solution to a state of cuprous oxid\r\nfirst announced by Trommer.[73] This was followed by a paper by Falck\r\non the quantitive determination of sugar in urine.[74]\r\n\r\nIn 1848 the methods, which have been proposed, were critically examined\r\nby Fehling, and from the date of his paper the determination of sugar\r\nby the copper method may be regarded as resting on a scientific\r\nbasis.[75]\r\n\r\nSince the date mentioned the principal improvements in the process\r\nhave been in changing the composition of the copper solution in order\r\nto render it more stable, which has been accomplished by varying the\r\nproportions of copper sulfate, alkali and tartaric acid. For the better\r\nkeeping of the solution the method of preserving the copper sulfate\r\nand the alkaline tartrates in separate flasks and only mixing them\r\nat the time of use has been found very efficacious.[76] For testing\r\nfor the end of the reaction by means of an acetic acid solution of\r\npotassium ferrocyanid the filtering tube suggested by the author, the\r\nuse of which will be described further on, has proved quite useful.\r\nPavy has suggested that by the addition of ammonia to the copper\r\nsolution the precipitated suboxid may be kept in solution and the end\r\nof the reaction thus easily distinguished by the disappearance of the\r\nblue color.[77] Allen has improved on this method by covering the hot\r\nmixture with a layer of paraffin oil whereby any oxidation of the\r\nsuboxid is prevented.[78]\r\n\r\nThe introduction and development of the gravimetric process depending\r\non securing the reduced copper oxid in a metallic state as developed by\r\nAllihn, Soxhlet, and others, completes the resumé of this brief sketch\r\nof the rise and development of the process.\r\n\r\n=114. Action of Alkaline Copper Solution on Dextrose.=—The action to\r\nwhich dextrose and other reducing sugars are subjected in the presence\r\nof a hot alkaline copper solution is two-fold in its nature. In the\r\nfirst place there is an oxidation of the sugar which is transformed\r\ninto tartronic, formic and oxalic acids, the two latter in very small\r\nquantities. At the same time another part of the sugar is attacked\r\ndirectly by the alkali and changed to complex products among which\r\nhave been detected lactic, oxyphenic and oxalic acids, also two bodies\r\nisomeric with dioxyphenolpropionic acid. When the sugar is in large\r\nexcess melassic and glucic acids have also been detected. The glucic\r\nacid may be regarded as being formed by simple dehydration but becomes\r\nat once resolved into pyrocatechin and gluconic acid according to\r\nthe reaction C₁₂H₁₈O₉ = C₆H₆O₂ + C₅H₁₂O₇. The gluconic acid also is\r\ndecomposed and gives birth to lactic and glyceric acids according to\r\nthe formula C₆H₁₂O₇ = C₃H₆O₃ + C₃H₆O₄. The glyceric acid also in the\r\npresence of a base is changed into lactic and oxalic acids. Between\r\nlactic acid and pyrocatechin, existing in a free state, there is\r\nproduced a double reciprocal etherification in virtue of which there\r\narise two ethers isomeric with hydrocaffeic acid, C₉H₁₀O₄. One of these\r\nbodies is an acid and corresponds to the constitution\r\n\r\n               CH₃\r\n              /\r\n        O ── CH\r\n       /      \\\r\n    C₆H₄       CO₂H (2)\r\n       \\\r\n        OH (2)\r\n\r\nand the other is of an alcoholic nature corresponding to the formula\r\n\r\n       CO₂ ── CHOH ── CH₃ (1)\r\n      /\r\n    C₆H₄\r\n      \\\r\n       OH₂ (2)\r\n\r\nOf all these products only oxyphenic and lactic acids and their ethers\r\nand oxalic acid remain unchanged and they can be isolated. All the\r\nothers are transformed in an acid state and they can only be detected\r\nby operating in the presence of metallic oxids capable of precipitating\r\nthem at the time of their formation.[79]\r\n\r\n=115. Fehling’s Solution.=—The copper solution which has been most used\r\nin the determination of reducing sugars is the one proposed by Fehling\r\nas a working modification of the original reagent used by Trommer.[80]\r\n\r\nFollowing is the formula for the preparation of the fehling solution:\r\n\r\n    Pure crystallized copper sulfate CuSO₄.5H₂O, 34.64 grams:\r\n    Potassium tartrate,                         150.00   ”\r\n    Sodium hydroxid,                             90.00   ”\r\n\r\nThe copper sulfate is dissolved in water and the potassium tartrate in\r\nthe aqueous solution of the sodium hydroxid which should have a volume\r\nof about 700 cubic centimeters. The two solutions are mixed and the\r\nvolume completed to a liter. Each cubic centimeter of this solution\r\nwill be reduced by five milligrams of dextrose, equivalent to four and\r\na half milligrams of sucrose.\r\n\r\nThe reaction which takes place is represented by the following\r\nmolecular proportions:\r\n\r\n     C₆H₁₂O₆      =     10CuSO₄.5H₂O\r\n    Dextrose.         Copper sulfate.\r\n       180                2494\r\n\r\nFehling’s solution is delicate in its reactions but does not keep well,\r\ndepositing cuprous oxid on standing especially in a warm place exposed\r\nto light. The fehling liquor was soon modified in its constitution by\r\nsubstituting 173 grams of the double sodium and potassium tartrate for\r\nthe neutral potassium tartrate first used, and, in fact, the original\r\nfehling reagent contained forty grams of copper sulfate instead of the\r\nquantity mentioned above. Other proportions of the ingredients are also\r\ngiven by many authors as fehling solution.\r\n\r\n=116.

Ten cubic centimeters equal\r\n      0.050 gram dextrose. Ten cubic centimeters equal 0.0475 gram cane\r\n      sugar.\r\n\r\n=117. Volumetric Method used in this Laboratory.=—The alkaline copper\r\nsolution preferred in this laboratory has the composition proposed by\r\nViolette. The copper sulfate and alkaline tartrate solutions are kept\r\nin separate vessels and mixed in proper proportions immediately before\r\nuse, and diluted with about three volumes of water. The reduction is\r\naccomplished in a long test tube at least twenty-five centimeters in\r\nlength, and from thirty-five to forty millimeters in diameter.\r\n\r\nThe sugar solution employed should contain approximately one per cent\r\nof reducing sugar. If it should have a greater content it should be\r\nreduced with water to approximately the one named. If it have a less\r\ncontent, it should be evaporated in a vacuum at a low temperature\r\nuntil it reaches the strength mentioned above. A preliminary test\r\nwill indicate almost the exact quantity of the sugar solution to be\r\nadded to secure a complete reduction of the copper. This having been\r\ndetermined the whole quantity should be added at once to the boiling\r\ncopper solution, the test tube held in the open flame of a lamp\r\ngiving a large circular flame and the contents of the tube kept in\r\nbrisk ebullition for just two minutes. The lamp is withdrawn and the\r\nprecipitated suboxid allowed to settle. If a distinct blue color remain\r\nan additional quantity of the sugar solution is added and again boiled\r\nfor two minutes. When the blue coloration is no longer distinct, the\r\npresence or absence of copper is determined by aspirating a drop or\r\ntwo of the hot solution with the apparatus described below. This clear\r\nfiltered liquor is then brought into contact with a drop of potassium\r\nferrocyanid solution acidulated with acetic. The production of a brown\r\nprecipitate or color indicates that some copper is still present,\r\nin which case an additional quantity of the sugar solution is added\r\nand the operation continued as described above until after the last\r\naddition of sugar solution no coloration is produced.\r\n\r\n=118. The Filtering Tube.=—The filtering tube used in the above\r\noperation is made of a long piece of narrow glass tubing with thick\r\nwalls. The length of the tube should be from forty to forty-five\r\ncentimeters. One end of the tube being softened in the flame is pressed\r\nagainst a block of wood so as to form a flange. Over this flange is\r\ntied a piece of fine linen.[82]\r\n\r\nInstead of using a linen diaphragm the tube is greatly improved, as\r\nsuggested by Knorr, by sealing into the end of the tube while hot a\r\nperforated platinum disk. Before using, the tube is dipped into a\r\nvessel containing some suspended asbestos felt and by aspiration a thin\r\nfelt of asbestos is formed over the outer surface of the platinum disk.\r\nBy inverting the tube the water which has entered during aspiration is\r\nremoved. The tube thus prepared is dipped into the boiling solution in\r\nthe test tube above described and aspiration continued until a drop of\r\nthe liquor has entered the tube. It is then removed from the boiling\r\nsolution, the asbestos felt wiped off with a clean towel, and the drop\r\nof liquor in the tube blown through the openings in the platinum disk\r\nand brought into contact with a drop of potassium ferrocyanid in the\r\nusual way. In this way a drop of the liquor is secured without any\r\ndanger of a reoxidation of the copper which may sometimes take place on\r\ncooling.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 42. APPARATUS FOR THE VOLUMETRIC ESTIMATION OF\r\nREDUCING SUGARS.]\r\n\r\nThe careful analyst by working in this way with the volumetric method\r\nis able to secure highly accurate results. The apparatus used is shown\r\nin the accompanying illustration.\r\n\r\n=119. Suppression of the Error Caused by the Action of the Alkali on\r\nReducing Sugars.=—Three methods are proposed by Gaud for correcting\r\nor suppressing the error due to the action of the alkali upon\r\nreducing sugars. In the first place, the common method followed may\r\nbe employed, depending upon the use of an alkaline copper solution of\r\nknown composition and the employment of a reducing sugar solution of\r\na strength varying between one-half and one per cent. The error which\r\nis introduced into such a reaction is a constant one and the solution\r\nhaving been tested once for all against pure sugar is capable of giving\r\nfairly accurate results.\r\n\r\nIn the second place, a table may be constructed in which the error\r\nis determined for sugar solutions for varying strengths, _viz._,\r\nfrom one-tenth of one per cent to ten per cent. If _y_ represent the\r\nerror and _x_ the exact percentage of reducing sugar present then the\r\ncorrection may be made by the following formula;\r\n\r\n    _y_ = -0.00004801_x_ + 0.02876359_x_².\r\n\r\nIn order to use this formula in practice the percentage of reducing\r\nsugar obtained by the actual analysis must be introduced and may be\r\nrepresented by θ. The formula for correction then becomes 0.02876_x_² -\r\n1.000048_x_ + θ = 0; whence the value of _x_ is easily computed.\r\n\r\nIn the third place, the error may be eliminated by substituting for\r\nan alkali which acts upon the glucose one which does not, _viz._,\r\nammonia. At the temperature of boiling water ammonia does not have any\r\ndecomposing effect upon reducing sugars. It is important, however,\r\nthat the reduction take place in an inert atmosphere in order to\r\navoid the oxidation of the dissolved cuprous oxid and the temperature\r\nneed not be carried beyond 80°. The end of the reaction can be easily\r\ndistinguished in this case by the disappearance of the blue color. When\r\none reaction is finished the copper may be completely reoxidized by\r\nconducting through it a current of air or oxygen for half an hour, when\r\nan additional quantity of ammonia may be added to supply any that may\r\nhave evaporated, and a new reduction accomplished with exactly the same\r\nquantity of copper as was used in the first. The solution used by Gaud\r\ncontains 36.65 grams of crystallized copper sulfate dissolved in water\r\nand the volume completed to one liter with ordinary aqueous ammonia.[83]\r\n\r\n=120. Permanganate Process for the Estimation of Reducing\r\nSugars.=—Dextrose, invert sugar, and other reducing sugars can also be\r\ndetermined with a fair degree of accuracy by an indirect volumetric\r\nprocess, in which a standard solution of potassium permanganate is\r\nused as the final reagent.[84] The principle of the process is based\r\nupon the observation that two molecules of dextrose reduce from an\r\nalkaline cupric tartrate solution five molecules of cuprous oxid.\r\nThe five molecules of cuprous oxid thus precipitated when added to an\r\nacid solution of ferric sulfate, will change five molecules of the\r\nferric sulfate to ten molecules of ferrous sulfate. The reaction is\r\nillustrated by the following equation:\r\n\r\n    {  5Cu₂O  } + { 5Fe₂(SO₄)₃ } + {  5H₂SO₄ }  = { 10CuSO₄  }\r\n    {715 parts}   { 2000 parts }   {490 parts}   {1595 parts}\r\n\r\n                + { 10FeSO₄  } + {  5H₂O  }\r\n                  {1520 parts}   {90 parts}\r\n\r\nThe ten molecules of ferrous sulfate formed as indicated in the above\r\nreaction, are reoxidized to ferric sulfate by a set solution of\r\npotassium permanganate. This reaction is illustrated by the equation\r\ngiven below:\r\n\r\n    { 10FeSO₄  } + { K₂Mn₂O₈   } + { 5H₂SO₄ } = { 5Fe₂(SO₄)₂ }\r\n    {1520 parts}   {316.2 parts}  {784 parts}  { 2000 parts }\r\n\r\n                 + {  2MnSO₄ } + {   K₂SO₄   } + {  8H₂O   }\r\n                   {302 parts}   {174.2 parts}   {144 parts}.\r\n\r\nBy the study of the above equations it is seen that two molecules\r\nof dextrose or other similar reducing sugar, are equivalent to one\r\nmolecule of potassium permanganate, as is shown by the following\r\nequations:\r\n\r\n    { 2C₆H₁₂O₆  } = {  5Cu₂O  }  = {  10FeSO₄  } =  {  K₂Mn₂O₈  }\r\n    { 360 parts }   {715 parts}    {1520 parts}     {316.2 parts}\r\n\r\nIt is thus seen that 316.2 parts by weight of potassium permanganate\r\nare equivalent to 360 parts by weight of dextrose; or one part of\r\npermanganate corresponds to 1.1385 parts by weight of dextrose. If,\r\ntherefore, the amount of permanganate required in the above reaction to\r\nrestore the iron to the ferric condition, be multiplied by the factor\r\nmentioned above, the quotient will represent in weight the amount of\r\ndextrose which enters into the reaction. The standard solution of\r\npotassium permanganate should contain 4.392 grams of the salt in a\r\nliter. One cubic centimeter of this solution is equivalent to five\r\nmilligrams of dextrose.\r\n\r\n=121. Manipulation.=—The saccharine solution whose strength is to be\r\ndetermined should contain approximately about one per cent of sugar.\r\nOf this solution ten cubic centimeters are placed in a porcelain dish\r\ntogether with a considerable excess of fehling solution. When no\r\nsucrose is present, the mixture may be heated to the temperature of\r\nboiling water and kept at that temperature for a few minutes until\r\nall the reducing sugar is oxidized. There should be enough of the\r\ncopper solution used to maintain a strong blue coloration at the end\r\nof the reaction. A greater uniformity of results will be secured by\r\nusing in all cases a considerable excess of the copper solution. When\r\nsucrose or other non-reducing sugars are present, the temperature of\r\nthe reaction should not be allowed to exceed 80° and the heating may\r\nbe continued somewhat longer. At this temperature the copper solution\r\nis absolutely without action on sucrose. The precipitated suboxid is\r\nallowed to settle, the supernatant liquid poured off through a filter\r\nand the suboxid washed thoroughly a number of times by decantation with\r\nhot water, the washings being poured through the filter. This process\r\nof washing is greatly facilitated by decanting the supernatant liquid\r\nfrom the porcelain dish first into a beaker and from this into a third\r\nbeaker and so on until no suboxid is carried off. Finally the wash\r\nwater is poured through a filter-paper bringing as little as possible\r\nof the suboxid onto the paper. The suboxid on the filter-paper and in\r\nthe beakers is next dissolved in a solution of ferric sulfate made\r\nstrongly acid with sulfuric; or in a sulfuric acid solution of ammonia\r\nferric sulfate which is more easily obtained free from impurities than\r\nthe ferric sulfate. When all is dissolved from the beakers the solution\r\nis poured upon the suboxid which still remains in the porcelain dish.\r\nWhen the solution is complete it is washed into a half liter flask and\r\nall the vessels which contain the suboxid are also thoroughly washed\r\nand the wash waters added to the same flask. The whole is rendered\r\nstrongly acid with sulfuric and made up to a volume of half a liter.\r\n\r\nThe process carried out as directed, when tested against pure sugar,\r\ngives good results, not varying from the actual content of the sugar\r\nby more than one-tenth per cent below or three-tenths above the true\r\ncontent. The distinct pink coloration imparted to the solution by the\r\npermanganate solution as soon as the iron is all oxidized to the ferric\r\nstate marks sharply the end of the reaction. In this respect this\r\nprocess is very much to be preferred to the usual volumetric processes\r\ndepending upon the coloration produced with potassium ferrocyanid\r\nby a copper salt for distinguishing the end of the reaction. It is\r\nless convenient than the ordinary volumetric process by reason of the\r\nsomewhat tedious method of washing the precipitated cuprous oxid. When\r\na large number of analyses is to be made, however, the whole can be\r\nwashed with no more expenditure of time than is required for a single\r\nsample. One analyst can, in this way, easily attend to fifty or a\r\nhundred determinations at a time.\r\n\r\nIn the application of the permanganate method to the analysis of the\r\njuices of sugar cane and sorghum it is directed to take 100 cubic\r\ncentimeters of the expressed juice and clarify by the addition of\r\ntwenty-five cubic centimeters of basic lead acetate, diluted with\r\nwater, containing enough of the lead acetate, however, to produce a\r\ncomplete clarification. It is not necessary to remove the excess of\r\nlead from the filtrate before the determination. Ten cubic centimeters\r\nof the filtrate correspond to eight cubic centimeters of the original\r\njuice. For percentage calculation the specific gravity of the original\r\njuice must be known. Before the addition of the alkaline copper\r\nsolution, from fifty to seventy-five cubic centimeters of water should\r\nbe added to the clarified sugar juice and the amount of fehling\r\nsolution used in each case should be from fifty to seventy-five cubic\r\ncentimeters. The heating at 75° should be continued for half an hour\r\nin order to insure complete reduction and oxidation of the sugar. The\r\nsucrose can also be estimated in the same juices by inverting five\r\ncubic centimeters of the clarified juice with five cubic centimeters\r\nof dilute hydrochloric acid, by heating for an hour at a temperature\r\nnot above 90°. Before adding the acid for inversion, about 100 cubic\r\ncentimeters of water should be poured over the five cubic centimeters\r\nof sugar solution. The washing of the suboxid and the estimation of the\r\namount reduced are accomplished in the manner above described.\r\n\r\nThis method has been extensively used in this laboratory and with very\r\nsatisfactory results. The only practical objection which can be urged\r\nto it is in the time required for filtering. This fault is easily\r\nremedied by adopting the method of filtering through asbestos felt\r\ndescribed in the next paragraph.\r\n\r\nFor the sake of uniformity, however, the copper solution should\r\nbe boiled for a few minutes before the addition of the sugar in\r\norder to expel all oxygen, the sugar solutions should be made with\r\nrecently boiled water and the precipitation of the suboxid should be\r\naccomplished by heating for just thirty minutes at 75°. At the end of\r\nthis time an equal volume of cold, recently boiled, water should be\r\nadded and the filtration at once accomplished.\r\n\r\n=122. Modified Permanganate Method.=—The permanganate method as used\r\nby Ewell, in this laboratory, is conducted as follows: After the\r\nprecipitate is obtained, according to the directions given in the\r\nmethods described, it is thoroughly washed with hot, recently boiled\r\nwater, on a gooch. The asbestos, with as much of the precipitate as\r\npossible, is transferred to the beaker in which the precipitation was\r\nmade, beaten up with from twenty-five to thirty cubic centimeters\r\nof hot, recently boiled water, and from fifty to seventy-five cubic\r\ncentimeters of a saturated solution of ferric sulfate in twenty-five\r\nper cent sulfuric acid are added to the beaker and then poured through\r\nthe crucible to dissolve the cuprous oxid remaining therein. If the\r\nprecipitate be first beaten up with water as directed, so that no\r\nlarge lumps of it remain, there is no difficulty in dissolving the\r\noxid in the ferric salt; while if any lumps of the oxid be allowed to\r\nremain there is great difficulty. After the solution is obtained, it is\r\ntitrated with a solution of potassium permanganate of such a strength\r\nthat each cubic centimeter is equivalent to 0.01 gram of copper.\r\n\r\nIn triplicate determinations made by this method the precipitates\r\nobtained required after solution in the ferric salt, 28.7, 28.9, 28.6\r\ncubic centimeters of potassium permanganate solution, respectively.\r\nFor the quantities taken this was equivalent to an average percentage\r\nof reducing sugars of 4.19. The percentage obtained by the gravimetric\r\nmethod was 4.26.\r\n\r\nThe method seems to be sufficiently accurate for all ordinary purposes\r\nand is extremely rapid.\r\n\r\nThe permanganate solution used should be standardized by means\r\nof metallic iron, but in ordinary work it is also recommended to\r\nstandardize by check determinations of reducing sugars in the same\r\nsample by the gravimetric method.\r\n\r\n=123. Determination of Reducing Sugar by the Specific Gravity of the\r\nCuprous Oxid.=—Gaud proposes to determine the percentage of reducing\r\nsugar from the specific gravity of the cuprous oxid. The manipulation\r\nis carried out as follows:\r\n\r\nIn a porcelain dish are placed fifty cubic centimeters of the alkaline\r\ncopper solution and an equal quantity of water and the mixture\r\nmaintained in ebullition for two or three minutes. The dish is then\r\nplaced on a boiling water-bath and twenty-five cubic centimeters of a\r\nreducing sugar of approximately one per cent strength added at once.\r\nThe reduction is thus secured at a temperature below 100°, which is an\r\nimportant consideration in securing the minimum decomposing effect of\r\nthe alkali upon the sugar. The dish is kept upon the water-bath for\r\nabout ten minutes when the reduction is complete and the supernatant\r\nliquor should still be intensely blue. The precipitate is washed by\r\ndecantation with boiling water, taking care to avoid the loss of any\r\nof the cuprous oxid. The washing is continued until the wash waters\r\nare neutral to phenolphthalein. The cuprous oxid is then washed into a\r\npyknometer of from twenty to twenty-five cubic centimeters capacity,\r\nthe exact content of which has been previously determined at zero. It\r\nis filled with boiling water, the stopper inserted, and after cooling\r\nthe flask is weighed. Let _P_ be the weight of the pyknometer plus the\r\nliquid and the precipitate, the total volume of which is equal to the\r\ncapacity of the flask at the temperature at which it was filled, that\r\nis _V_ₜ = _V_₀ [1 + 3β(_t_-_t_₀)].\r\n\r\nThis formula is essentially that given in paragraph =51=, for\r\ncalculating the volume of a pyknometer at any temperature, substituting\r\nfor 3β, γ the cubical expansion of glass, _viz_., 0.000025.\r\n\r\nThe specific gravity of the dry cuprous oxid is Δ = 5.881 and let the\r\nspecific gravity of water at the temperature of filling, which can be\r\ntaken from any of the tables of the density of water, be _d_. The total\r\nweight _p_ of the precipitated suboxid may then be calculated by the\r\nfollowing formula:\r\n\r\n\r\n          _P_-_V_ₜ_d_\r\n    _P_ = -----------.\r\n           1 - _d_\r\n               ----\r\n                Δ\r\n\r\nThe density of water at 99°, which is about the mean temperature of\r\nboiling water for laboratories in general, is 0.95934, and this may be\r\ntaken as the weight of one cubic centimeter for purposes of calculation\r\nin the formula above.\r\n\r\nIn order to obtain exact results, it is important that the weight\r\n_P_ be reduced to a vacuum. The weight of cuprous oxid not varying\r\nproportionally to the weight of reducing sugar, it is necessary to\r\nprepare a table showing the principal numerical values of the two, in\r\norder to be able to calculate easily all the possible values, either\r\ndirectly from the table or by appropriate interpolations. Following are\r\nthe chief values which are necessary for the calculation:\r\n\r\n     Milligrams      Milligrams     Milligrams      Milligrams\r\n    cuprous oxid.    dextrose.     cuprous oxid.     dextrose.\r\n\r\n         10             5.413          100            46.221\r\n         20             9.761          200            91.047\r\n         30            14.197          300           138.842\r\n         50            23.036          400           188.928\r\n\r\nIt is claimed by the author that the above method is both simple and\r\nrapid and can be applied with an error of not more than one-thousandth\r\nif the corrections for temperature and pressure be rigorously\r\napplied.[85]\r\n\r\n=124. The Copper Carbonate Process.=—While the copper solutions which\r\nhave been mentioned in previous paragraphs have only a slight action\r\non sucrose and dextrin yet on prolonged boiling even these bodies show\r\na reducing effect due probably to a preliminary change in the sugar\r\nmolecules whereby products analogous to dextrose or invert sugar are\r\nformed. In order to secure a reagent, to which the sugar not reducing\r\nalkaline copper solutions might be more resistant Soldaini has proposed\r\nto employ a liquor containing the copper as carbonate instead of\r\nas tartrate.[86] This solution is prepared by adding to a solution\r\nof forty grams of copper sulfate one of equal strength of sodium\r\ncarbonate. The resulting copper carbonate and hydroxid are collected on\r\na filter, washed with cold water, and dried. The reaction which takes\r\nplace is represented by the following formula:\r\n\r\n    2CuSO₄ + 2Na₂CO₃ + H₂O = CuCO₃ + CuO₂H₂ + 2Na₂SO₄ + CO₂.\r\n\r\nThe dry precipitate obtained, which will weigh about fifteen grams, is\r\nplaced in a large flask with about 420 grams of potassium bicarbonate\r\nand 1400 cubic centimeters of water. The contents of the flask are\r\nheated on a steam-bath for several hours with occasional stirring\r\nuntil the evolution of carbon dioxid has ceased. During this time the\r\nliquid is kept at the same volume by the addition of water, or by\r\nattaching a reflux condenser to the flask. The potassium and copper\r\ncompounds at the end of this time will be found dissolved and the\r\nresulting liquor will have a deep blue color. After filtration the\r\nsolution is boiled for a few minutes and cooled to room temperature.\r\nThe volume is then completed to two liters. A more direct method of\r\npreparing the solution, and one quite as effective, consists in adding\r\nthe solution of the copper sulfate directly to the hot solution of\r\npotassium bicarbonate and heating and shaking the mixture until the\r\ncopper carbonate formed is dissolved. After filtering the volume is\r\nmade as above. The proportions of reagents employed are placed by\r\nPreuss at 15.8 grams of crystallized copper sulfate and 594 grams of\r\npotassium bicarbonate.[87] The soldaini reagent is extremely sensitive\r\nand is capable of detecting as little as half a milligram of invert\r\nsugar. The presence of sucrose makes the reagent more delicate, and it\r\nis especially useful in determining the invert sugar arising during the\r\nprogress of manufacture by the action of heat and melassigenic bodies\r\non sucrose.\r\n\r\n=125. The Analytical Process.=—As in the case of fehling solution a\r\ngreat many methods of conducting the analysis with the soldaini reagent\r\nhave been proposed. The general principle of all these processes is\r\nthe one already described for the alkaline copper tartrate solution,\r\n_viz._, the addition of the reducing sugar solution to the boiling\r\nreagent, and the determination of the end of the reaction by the\r\ndisappearance of the copper.[88]\r\n\r\nPractically, however, these methods have had no general application,\r\nand the use of the soldaini reagent has been confined chiefly to the\r\ndetermination of invert sugar in presence of a large excess of sucrose.\r\nFor this purpose the sugar solution is not added until the blue color\r\nof the reagent has been destroyed, but on the other hand, the reagent\r\nhas been used in excess, and the cuprous oxid formed collected and\r\nweighed as metallic copper. The weight of the metallic copper found,\r\nmultiplied by the factor 0.3546, gives the weight of invert sugar in\r\nthe volume of the sugar solution used. According to Preuss, the factor\r\nis not a constant one, but varies with the quantity of invert sugar\r\npresent, as is seen in the formula _y_ = 2.2868 + 3.3_x_ + 0.0041_x_²,\r\nin which _x_ = the invert sugar, and _y_ the metallic copper.[89]\r\n\r\n=126. Tenth Normal Copper Carbonate Solution.=—In the study of some\r\nof the solutions of copper carbonate, proposed for practical work,\r\nEttore Soldaini was impressed with the difficulty of dissolving so\r\nlarge a quantity of carbonate in the solvent employed.[90] The solution\r\nrecommended by Bodenbender and Scheller,[91] in which forty grams\r\nof the crystallized copper sulfate were used, failed to disclose\r\nan equivalent amount of copper in the reagent ready for use. For\r\nthis reason a tenth-normal copper solution is prepared by Soldaini\r\ncontaining the equivalent of 3.464 grams of copper sulfate in one\r\nliter. The reagent is easily prepared by adding slowly the dissolved\r\nor finely powdered copper salt to a solution of 297 grams of potassium\r\nbicarbonate, and after complete solution of the copper carbonate\r\nformed, completing the volume to one liter. With this reagent as little\r\nas one-quarter of a milligram of reducing sugar can be easily detected.\r\nFor the quantitive estimation of sugar a solution of the above strength\r\nis to be preferred to the other forms of the soldaini reagent by reason\r\nof the ease of direct comparison with standard fehling solutions.\r\n\r\nThe analytical process is conducted with the tenth-normal solution,\r\nprepared by Soldaini and described above, as follows: Place 100 cubic\r\ncentimeters of the reagent in each of several porcelain dishes heat\r\nto boiling, and add little by little the sugar solution to one dish\r\nuntil the blue color has disappeared. Having thus determined nearly the\r\nexact quantity of sugar solution required for the copper in 100 cubic\r\ncentimeters of the reagent the whole of the sugar solution is added at\r\nonce, varying slightly the amounts added to each dish. The boiling is\r\ncontinued for fifteen minutes, and the contents of the dishes poured\r\non filters. That filtrate which contains neither copper nor sugar\r\nrepresents the exact quantity of sugar solution which contained fifty\r\nmilligrams of dextrose.\r\n\r\n=127. Relation of Reducing Sugar to Quantity of Copper Suboxid\r\nObtained.=—The relation of the quantity of copper reduced to the amount\r\nof sugar oxidized by the copper carbonate solution has been determined\r\nby Ost, and the utility of the process thereby increased.[92] The\r\nsolution used should have the following composition: 23.5 grams of\r\ncrystallized copper sulfate, 250 grams of potassium carbonate, and 100\r\ngrams of potassium bicarbonate in one liter. Without an indicator the\r\nend reaction is distinctly marked by the passage of the blue color into\r\na colorless solution. Ost affirms that this solution is preferable\r\nto any form of fehling liquor because it can be kept indefinitely\r\nunchanged; it attacks sucrose far less strongly, and an equal quantity\r\nof sugar precipitates nearly double the quantity of copper. The boiling\r\nrequires a longer time, as a rule ten minutes, but this is a matter of\r\nno importance, when the other advantages are taken into consideration.\r\nThe relations of the different sugars to the quantity of copper\r\nprecipitated are given in the table in the next paragraph.\r\n\r\n=128. Factor for Different Sugars.=—For pure dextrose the relation\r\nbetween sugar and copper reduced has been determined by Ost, and the\r\ndata are given in the table below. The data were obtained by adding\r\nto fifty cubic centimeters of the copper solution twenty-five cubic\r\ncentimeters of sugar solutions of varying strength and collecting,\r\nwashing, and reducing the cuprous oxid obtained in a current of\r\nhydrogen in a glass tube by the method described further on.\r\n\r\nThe boiling in all cases was continued, just ten minutes, although a\r\nslight variation from the standard time did not produce so great a\r\ndifference as with fehling reagent. In the case of dextrose, when fifty\r\nmilligrams were used with fifty cubic centimeters of the solution,\r\nthe milligrams of copper obtained after six, ten and twenty minutes’\r\nboiling were 164.6, 165.5, and 166.9 respectively.[93]\r\n\r\nThe data differ considerably from those obtained by Herzfeld, but\r\nin his experiments the boiling was continued only for five minutes,\r\nand this is not long enough to secure the proper reduction of the\r\ncopper.[94]\r\n\r\n    TABLE SHOWING THE QUANTITY OF COPPER REDUCED BY DIFFERENT SUGARS.\r\n\r\n     Copper.

Pavy’s Process.=—The well-known solubility of cuprous oxid in\r\nammonia led Pavy to adopt a copper reagent containing ammonia in the\r\nvolumetric determination of reducing sugars.[95] In Pavy’s process an\r\nalkaline copper solution is employed made up in the usual way, to which\r\na sufficient quantity of ammonia is added to hold in solution all the\r\ncopper when precipitated as cuprous oxid. The solution used by Pavy has\r\nthe following composition: One liter contains\r\n\r\n    Crystallized copper sulfate   34.65 grams\r\n    Potassium-sodium tartrate    173.00   ”\r\n    Caustic potash               160.00   ”\r\n\r\nFor use 120 cubic centimeters of the above reagent are mixed with 300\r\nof ammonia of specific gravity 0.88, and the volume completed to one\r\nliter with distilled water. Twenty cubic centimeters of this reagent\r\nare equivalent to ten milligrams of dextrose or invert sugar when added\r\nin a one per cent solution.\r\n\r\nIn the use of ammoniacal copper solution, care must be taken that\r\nall the liquids employed be entirely free of oxygen and that the\r\ncontents of the flask in which the reduction takes place be in some way\r\nexcluded from contact with the air. Pavy secured this by conducting\r\nthe reduction in a flask closed with a stopper carrying two holes;\r\none of these served for the introduction of the burette carrying the\r\nsugar solution and the other carried a tube dipping into a water seal\r\nby means of a slit rubber tube, which would permit of the exit of the\r\nvapors of steam and ammonia, but prevent the regurgitation of the water\r\ninto the flask.\r\n\r\nThe complete decoloration of the copper solution marks the end of the\r\nreaction. The usual precautions in regard to the length of the time of\r\nboiling must be observed.\r\n\r\nIt is easy to see that in the Pavy process the quantity of ammonia in\r\nthe solution is rapidly diminished during the boiling and this has led\r\nto the suggestion of other methods to exclude the air. Among these\r\nhave been recommended the introduction of a current of hydrogen or\r\ncarbon dioxid. One of the best methods of procedure is that proposed\r\nby Allen, who recommends covering the copper solution by a layer of\r\nparaffin oil (kerosene).[96]\r\n\r\n=130. Process Of Peska.=—Peska has also independently made use of\r\nAllen’s method of covering the solutions with a layer of paraffin oil\r\nand finds it reliable.[97] The copper reagent employed by him has the\r\nfollowing composition:\r\n\r\n    Crystallized copper sulfate               6.927 grams\r\n    Ammonia, twenty-five per cent strength   160.00 cc.\r\n\r\nThe copper sulfate is dissolved in water, the ammonia added, and\r\nthe volume completed to half a liter with distilled water. A second\r\nsolution containing half a liter is made by dissolving 34.5 grams\r\nof potassium-sodium tartrate and ten grams of sodium hydroxid and\r\ncompleting the cool solution to half a liter with distilled water.\r\nIn all cases the water used in making up the above solutions must be\r\nfreshly boiled to exclude the air.\r\n\r\nFor the titration, fifty cubic centimeters of each of the above\r\nsolutions are taken, mixed and covered with a layer of paraffin oil\r\nhalf a centimeter in depth. The reduction is not accomplished at a\r\nboiling temperature, but at from 80° to 85°. The manipulation is\r\nconducted as follows:\r\n\r\nThe mixed solutions are placed in a beaker, covered with oil, and\r\nheated to 80°. The temperature is measured by a thermometer which also\r\nserves as a stirring rod. The sugar solution is run down the sides\r\nof the beaker from a burette of such a shape as to be protected from\r\nthe heat. After each addition of the sugar solution the mixture is\r\ncarefully stirred, keeping the temperature at from 80° to 85°. The\r\nfirst titration is made to determine approximately the quantity of\r\nsugar solution necessary to decolorize the copper. This done, the\r\nactual titration is accomplished by adding at once the total amount\r\nof sugar solution necessary to decolorize, less about one cubic\r\ncentimeter. Any sugar solution adhering to the side of the beaker\r\nis washed down by distilled water, the contents of the beaker well\r\nstirred, and the temperature kept at 85° for two minutes. The rest of\r\nthe sugar solution is then added in quantities of one-tenth of a cubic\r\ncentimeter until the decoloration is completed. The total time of the\r\nfinal titration should not exceed five minutes. The sugar solution\r\nshould be as nearly as possible of one per cent strength. If a lower\r\ndegree of strength be employed a larger quantity of the sugar is\r\nnecessary to reduce a given quantity of copper.\r\n\r\nIn the case of dextrose, when a one per cent solution is used, eight\r\nand two-tenths cubic centimeters, corresponding to 80.2 milligrams of\r\ndextrose, are required to reduce 100 cubic centimeters of the mixed\r\nreagent. On the other hand, when the sugar solution is diluted to\r\none-tenth of a per cent strength 82.1 milligrams are required.\r\n\r\nWith invert sugar slightly larger quantities are necessary, the\r\nreducing power being as 94.9 to 100 as compared with dextrose. With\r\na one per cent strength of invert sugar it is found that eighty-four\r\nmilligrams are required to reduce 100 cubic centimeters of the mixed\r\nreagent and when the strength of the invert sugar is reduced to\r\none-tenth per cent 87.03 milligrams are required.\r\n\r\n=131. Method Of Allein and Gaud.=—Allein and Gaud have proposed a\r\nfurther modification of the ammonia process which consists essentially\r\nin the suppression of rochelle salt and fixed caustic alkali and the\r\nentire substitution therefor of ammonia. Ammonia acts with much less\r\nvigor upon sugars than the caustic alkalies, and it is therefore\r\nclaimed that the decomposition of the sugar due to the alkali is\r\nreduced to a minimum when ammonia is employed.[98] The copper solution\r\nis made as follows:\r\n\r\nDissolve 8.7916 grams of electrolytic copper in ninety-three grams\r\nof concentrated sulfuric acid diluted with an equal volume of water.\r\nComplete the resulting solution to one liter with concentrated ammonia.\r\nTen cubic centimeters of this solution are equal to fifty grams of\r\ndextrose.\r\n\r\nIt is recommended that the reduction be accomplished in an atmosphere\r\nof hydrogen, but it is apparent that the use of kerosene is permissible\r\nin this case, and on account of its greater simplicity it is to be\r\nrecommended as the best means of excluding the oxygen. The reduction is\r\naccomplished at a temperature of about 80°.\r\n\r\nIt is also proposed to reoxidize the copper by substituting a current\r\nof air for the hydrogen at the end of the reaction, and thus use the\r\nsame copper a number of times. The danger of loss of ammonia, and the\r\ndifficulty of determining when the oxidation is complete, render this\r\nregeneration of the reagent undesirable.\r\n\r\n=132. Method of Gerrard.=—The method of Gerrard does not depend upon\r\nthe use of ammonia, but the principle involved is the same, _viz._, the\r\nholding of the separated cuprous oxid in solution and the determination\r\nof the end of the reaction by the disappearance of the blue color.\r\nAs first proposed by Gerrard, the copper sulfate solution is made of\r\ndouble the strength usually employed and to each 100 cubic centimeters\r\nthereof, before use, three and three-tenths grams of potassium cyanid\r\nare added. This is sufficient to hold the precipitated cuprous oxid in\r\nsolution.[99]\r\n\r\nThe original method of Gerrard is found difficult of execution and the\r\nauthor, in conjunction with Allen, has lately modified it and reduced\r\nit to a practical working basis.[100]\r\n\r\nIn the new method the ordinary fehling solution is employed and it\r\nis prepared for use in the following way: Ten cubic centimeters of\r\nthe fehling solution, or half that quantity of each of the component\r\nparts kept in separate bottles, are placed in a porcelain dish with\r\nforty cubic centimeters of water and brought to the boiling-point. To\r\nthe boiling liquid is added, from a pipette, a five per cent solution\r\nof potassium cyanid until the blue color just disappears, or only a\r\nvery faint tint of blue remains, avoiding any excess of the cyanid. A\r\nsecond portion of the fehling solution equal to that first employed\r\nis added, and to the boiling mixture the solution of sugar is added,\r\nfrom a burette, until the blue color disappears. The contents of the\r\ndish should be kept boiling during the addition of the sugar solution.\r\nThe volume used will contain fifty milligrams of dextrose. The sugar\r\nsolution should be of such a strength as to contain no more than half a\r\nper cent of reducing sugar.\r\n\r\nThe principle of the preparation of the solution may be stated as\r\nfollows: If to a solution of copper sulfate, potassium be added until\r\nthe blue color disappears, a double cyanid of copper and potassium\r\ncyanid is formed according to the following reaction: CuSO₄ + 4KCN =\r\nCu(CN)₂.2KCN + K₂SO₄. This double cyanid is a salt of considerable\r\nstability. It is not decomposed by alkalies, hydrogen or ammonium,\r\nsulfid. With mineral acids it gives a whitish, curdy precipitate. With\r\nfehling solution the same double cyanid is formed as that described\r\nabove. If, however, fehling solution be present in excess of the amount\r\nnecessary to form the double cyanid of copper, this excess can be used\r\nin the oxidation of reducing sugar and the colorless condition of the\r\nsolution will be restored as soon as the excess of the fehling is\r\ndestroyed. The double cyanid holds in solution the cuprous oxid formed\r\nand thus complete decoloration is secured.\r\n\r\n=133. Sidersky’s Modification of Soldaini’s Process.=—In all cases\r\nwhere the sugar solutions are not too highly colored, Sidersky finds\r\nthat the method of reduction in a large test tube, as practiced by\r\nViolette, is applicable with the copper carbonate solution.[101] For\r\nmore exact work it is preferred to determine the quantity of copper\r\nreduced by an indirect volumetric method. The sugar solution, properly\r\nclarified and the lead removed if subacetates have been used, is made\r\nof such a volume as to contain less than one per cent of reducing\r\nsugars. In a flask or large test tube are placed 100 cubic centimeters\r\nof the copper solution, which is boiled for a short time and the sugar\r\nsolution added, little by little, from a pipette, at such a rate as\r\nnot to stop the ebullition. The boiling is continued for five minutes\r\nafter the last addition of the sugar. The vessel is taken from the\r\nflame and 100 cubic centimeters of cold water added, the whole brought\r\non an asbestos felt and the cuprous oxid washed with hot water until\r\nthe alkaline reaction has disappeared. The residual cuprous oxid\r\nis dissolved in a measured quantity of set sulfuric acid, semi- or\r\nfifth-normal, a few particles of potassium chlorate added, and the\r\nmixture boiled to convert any cuprous into cupric sulfate. The reaction\r\nis represented by the following formula:\r\n\r\n    3Cu₂O + 6H₂SO₄ + KClO₃ = 6CuSO₄ + KCl + 6H₂O.\r\n\r\nThe residual sulfuric acid is titrated with a set alkali in excess,\r\nammonia being preferred.\r\n\r\nThe solution of ammonia is made by diluting 200 cubic centimeters of\r\ncommercial aqua ammonia with 800 of water. Its strength is determined\r\nby adding a little copper sulfate solution as indicator and then\r\nthe set solution of sulfuric acid until the blue color disappears.\r\nThe copper sulfate secured from the cuprous sulfate as described\r\nabove is cooled, and a quantity of the ammonia, equal to twenty-five\r\ncubic centimeters of the set sulfuric acid, added. The excess of the\r\nammonia is then determined by titration with the sulfuric acid, the\r\ndisappearance of the blue color being the indication of the end of the\r\nreaction. The number of cubic centimeters of the set sulfuric acid\r\nrequired to saturate the ammonia represents the equivalent of cuprous\r\noxid originally present. One cubic centimeter of normal sulfuric acid\r\nis equivalent to 0.0317 gram of metallic copper.\r\n\r\nTo determine the weight of invert sugar oxidized, multiply the weight\r\nof copper, calculated as above described, by the factor 0.3546.[102]\r\nFor a general application of this method of analysis the relative\r\nquantities of copper reduced by different quantities of sugar must be\r\ntaken into consideration.\r\n\r\nWhile, as has already been stated, the copper carbonate process has\r\nheretofore been applied chiefly to the detection of invert sugar, it\r\nhas merits which justify the expectation that it may some time supplant\r\nthe fehling liquor both for volumetric and gravimetric work. Large\r\nvolumes of the reagent can be prepared at once and without danger of\r\nsubsequent change. The action of the reagent on the hexobioses and\r\ntrioses is far less vigorous than that of the alkaline copper tartrate,\r\nand the end reactions for volumetric work are, at least, as easily\r\ndetermined in the one case as the other.\r\n\r\n=134. Method Depending on Titration of Excess of Copper.=—Instead of\r\nmeasuring the quantity of copper reduced, either by its disappearance\r\nor by reducing the cuprous oxid to a metallic state, Politis has\r\nproposed a method of analysis depending on the titration of the\r\nresidual copper.[103] The reagents employed are:\r\n\r\n(1) A copper solution containing 24.95 grams of crystallized copper\r\nsulfate, 140 grams of sodium and potassium tartrate, and twenty-five\r\ngrams of sodium hydroxid in one liter:\r\n\r\n(2) A solution of sodium thiosulfate containing 24.8 grams of the salt\r\nin one liter:\r\n\r\n(3) A solution of potassium iodid containing 12.7 grams of iodin in one\r\nliter.\r\n\r\nThe reaction is represented by the formula\r\n\r\n    2CuCl₂ + 4KI = Cu₂I₂ + 4KCl + I₂.\r\n\r\nThe analytical process is carried out as follows: In a 100 cubic\r\ncentimeter flask are boiled fifty cubic centimeters of the copper\r\nsolution, ten cubic centimeters of about one-tenth per cent reducing\r\nsugar solution are added, the boiling continued for five minutes,\r\nthe flask filled to the mark with boiling water and its contents\r\nfiltered. Fifty cubic centimeters of the hot filtrate are cooled,\r\nslightly acidified, potassium iodid solution added in slight excess;\r\nand the iodin set free determined by titration with sodium thiosulfate.\r\nThe quantity of iodin obtained corresponds to the unreduced copper\r\nremaining after treatment with the reducing sugar. The number of cubic\r\ncentimeters of thiosulfate used subtracted from twenty-five will give\r\nthe number of cubic centimeters of the copper solution which would be\r\nreduced by five cubic centimeters of the sugar solution used.\r\n\r\n_Example._—In the proportions given above it was found that eleven\r\ncubic centimeters of thiosulfate were required to saturate the iodin\r\nset free. Then 25 - 11 = 14 cubic centimeters of copper solution\r\nreduced by five cubic centimeters of the sugar solution. Since one\r\ncubic centimeter of the copper solution is reduced by 0.0036 gram of\r\ndextrose the total dextrose in the five cubic centimeters = 0.0036 × 5\r\n= 0.0180 gram.\r\n\r\nThe above method does not seem to have any practical advantage over\r\nthose based on noting the disappearance of the copper and is given only\r\nto illustrate the principle of the process. While the titration of the\r\niodin by sodium thiosulfate is easily accomplished in the absence of\r\norganic matter, it becomes difficult, as shown by Ewell, when organic\r\nmatters are present, as they always are in the oxidation of a sugar\r\nsolution. Ewell has therefore proposed to determine the residual copper\r\nby a standard solution of potassium cyanid, but the method has not yet\r\nbeen developed.[104]\r\n\r\n\r\nGRAVIMETRIC COPPER METHODS.\r\n\r\n=135. General Principles.=—In the preceding pages the principles\r\nof the volumetric methods of sugar analysis by means of alkaline\r\ncopper solution have been set forth. They depend either on the total\r\ndecomposition of the copper solution employed by the reducing sugar,\r\nor else on the collection and titration of the cuprous oxid formed in\r\nthe reaction. In the gravimetric methods the general principle of the\r\nprocess rests upon the collection of the cuprous oxid formed and its\r\nreduction to metallic copper, the weight of which serves as a starting\r\npoint in the calculations of the weight of reducing sugar, which has\r\nbeen oxidized in the solution.\r\n\r\nThe factors which affect the weight of copper obtained are essentially\r\nthose which influence the results in the volumetric method. The\r\ncomposition of the copper solution, the temperature at which the\r\nreduction is accomplished, the time of heating, the strength of the\r\nsugar solution and the details of the manipulation, all affect more or\r\nless the quantity of copper obtained. As in the volumetric method also,\r\nthe kind of reducing sugar must be taken in consideration, dextrose,\r\nlevulose, invert sugar, maltose and other sugars having each a definite\r\nfactor for reduction in given conditions. It follows, therefore, that\r\nonly those results are of value which are obtained under definite\r\nconditions, rigidly controlled.\r\n\r\n=136. Gravimetric Methods of the Department of Agriculture\r\nLaboratory.=—The process used in this laboratory is based essentially\r\non the methods of Maercker, Behrend, Morgen, Meissl, Hiller and\r\nAllihn.[105] Where dextrose alone is present, the table of factors\r\nproposed by Allihn is used and also the copper solution corresponding\r\nthereto.\r\n\r\nFor pure invert sugar, the tables and solutions of Meissl are used. For\r\ninvert sugar in the presence of sucrose, the table and process proposed\r\nby Hiller are used.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 43. APPARATUS FOR THE ELECTROLYTIC DEPOSITION OF\r\nCOPPER.]\r\n\r\nThe reduction of the copper solution and the electrolytic deposition of\r\nthe copper are accomplished as follows:\r\n\r\nThe copper and alkali solutions are kept in separate bottles. After\r\nmixing the equivalent volume of the two solutions in a beaker, heat is\r\napplied and the mixture boiled. To the boiling liquid the proper volume\r\nof the cold sugar solution is added. This must always be less than the\r\namount required for complete reduction. The solution is again brought\r\ninto ebullition and kept boiling exactly two minutes. A two-minute\r\nsand glass is conveniently used to determine the time of boiling. At\r\nthe end of this time an equal volume of freshly boiled cold water is\r\nadded, and the supernatant liquor at once passed through a gooch under\r\npressure. The residual cuprous oxid is covered with boiling water and\r\nwashed by decantation until the wash water is no longer alkaline. It\r\nis more convenient to wash in such a way that, at the end, the greater\r\npart of the cuprous oxid is in the gooch. The felt and cuprous oxid are\r\nthen returned to the beaker in which the reduction is made. The gooch\r\nis moistened with nitric acid to dissolve any adhering oxid and then\r\nis washed into the beaker. Enough nitric acid is added to bring all\r\nthe oxid into solution, an excess being avoided, and a small amount\r\nof water added. The mixture is again passed under pressure through\r\na gooch having a thin felt, to remove the asbestos and the filtrate\r\ncollected in a flask of about 150 cubic centimeters capacity. The\r\nwashing is continued until the gooch is free of copper, when the volume\r\nof the filtrate should be about 100 cubic centimeters. The liquid is\r\ntransferred to a platinum dish holding about 175 cubic centimeters and\r\nthe flask washed with about twenty-five cubic centimeters of water.\r\nFrom three to five cubic centimeters of strong sulfuric acid are added\r\nand the copper deposited by an electric current.\r\n\r\n=137. Precipitating the Copper.=—When no more nitric acid is used than\r\nindicated in the previous paragraph, it will not be necessary to remove\r\nit by evaporation. The platinum dishes containing the solutions of the\r\ncuprous oxid are arranged as shown in the figure for the precipitation\r\nof the copper by the electric current. Each of the supporting stands\r\nhas its base covered with sheet-copper, on which the platinum dishes\r\nrest. The uprights are made of heavy glass rods and carry the supports\r\nfor the platinum cylinders which dip into the copper solutions. The\r\ncurrent used is from the city service and is brought in through the\r\nlamp shown at the right of the figure. This current has a voltage of\r\nabout 120. After passing the lamp it is conducted through the regulator\r\nshown at the right, a glass tube closed below by a stopper carrying a\r\npiece of platinum foil, and above by one holding a glass tube, in the\r\nlower end of which is sealed a piece of sheet platinum connected,\r\nthrough the glass tube, with the lamp. The regulating tube contains\r\ndilute sulfuric acid. The strength of current desired is secured by\r\nadjusting the movable pole. A battery of this kind easily secures the\r\nprecipitation of sixteen samples at once, but only twelve are shown\r\nin the figure. The practice here is to start the operation at the\r\ntime of leaving the laboratory in the afternoon. The next morning\r\nthe deposition of the copper will be found complete. The wiring of\r\nthe apparatus is shown in the figure. The wire from the regulator is\r\nconnected with the base of the first stand, and thence passes through\r\nthe horizontal support to the base of the second, and so on. The return\r\nto the lamp is accomplished by means of the upper wire. This plan of\r\narranging the apparatus has been used for two years, and with perfect\r\nsatisfaction.\r\n\r\nWhere a street current is not available, the following directions\r\nmay be followed: Use four gravity cells, such as are employed in\r\ntelegraphic work, for generating the current. This will be strong\r\nenough for one sample and by working longer for two. Connect the\r\nplatinum dish with the zinc pole of the battery. The current is allowed\r\nto pass until all the copper is deposited. Where a larger number of\r\nsamples is to be treated at once, the size of the battery must be\r\ncorrespondingly increased.\r\n\r\n=138. Method Used at the Halle Station.=—The method used at the Halle\r\nstation is the same as that originally described by Maercker for\r\ndextrose.[106] The copper solution employed is the same as in the allihn\r\nmethod, _viz._, 34.64 grams of copper sulfate in 500 cubic centimeters,\r\nand 173 grams of rochelle salt and 125 grams of potassium hydroxid in\r\nthe same quantity of water. In a porcelain dish are placed thirty cubic\r\ncentimeters of copper solution and an equal quantity of the alkali,\r\nsixty cubic centimeters of water added and the mixture boiled. To the\r\nsolution, in lively ebullition, are added twenty-five cubic centimeters\r\nof the dextrose solution to be examined which must not contain more\r\nthan one per cent of sugar. The mixture is again boiled and the\r\nseparated cuprous oxid immediately poured into the filter and washed\r\nwith hot water, until the disappearance of an alkaline reaction. For\r\nfiltering, a glass tube is employed, provided with a platinum disk,\r\nand resembling in every respect similar tubes used for the extraction\r\nof substances with ether and alcohol. The arrangement of the filtering\r\napparatus is shown in Fig. 44. In the Halle method it is recommended\r\nthat the tubes be prepared by introducing a platinum cone in place of\r\nthe platinum disk and filling it with asbestos felt, pressing the felt\r\ntightly against the sides of the glass tube and making the asbestos\r\nfully one centimeter in thickness. This is a much less convenient\r\nmethod of working than the one described above. After filtration and\r\nwashing, the cuprous oxid is washed with ether and alcohol and dried\r\nfor an hour at 110°, and finally reduced to metallic copper in a stream\r\nof pure dry hydrogen, heat being applied by means of a small flame. The\r\napparatus for the reduction of the cuprous oxid is shown in Fig. 45.\r\nThe metallic copper, after cooling and weighing, is dissolved in nitric\r\nacid, the tube washed with water, ether and alcohol, and again dried,\r\nwhen it is ready for use a second time. The percentage of dextrose is\r\ncalculated from the milligrams of copper found by Allihn’s table.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 44. APPARATUS FOR FILTERING COPPER SUBOXID.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 45. APPARATUS FOR REDUCING COPPER SUBOXID.]\r\n\r\n=139. Tables for Use in the Gravimetric Determination of Reducing\r\nSugars.=—The value of a table for computing the percentage of a\r\nreducing sugar present in a solution, is based on the accuracy with\r\nwhich the directions for the determination are followed. The solution\r\nmust be of the proper strength and made in the way directed. The degree\r\nof dilution prescribed must be scrupulously preserved and the methods\r\nof boiling during reduction and washing the reduced copper, followed.\r\nThe quantity of copper obtained by the use of different alkaline copper\r\nsolutions and of sugar solutions of a strength different from that\r\nallowed by the fixed limits, is not a safe factor for computation.\r\nIt must be understood, therefore, that in the use of the tables the\r\ndirections which are given are to be followed in every particular.\r\n\r\n=140. Allihn’s Gravimetric Method for the Determination of\r\nDextrose.=—_Reagents_:\r\n\r\n     I. 34.639 grams of CuSO₄.5H₂O, dissolved in water and diluted to\r\n        half a liter:\r\n\r\n    II. 173 grams of rochelle salts } dissolved in water and diluted\r\n        125 grams of KOH,           } to half a liter.\r\n\r\n_Manipulation_: Place thirty cubic centimeters of the copper solution\r\n(I), thirty cubic centimeters of the alkaline tartrate solution (II),\r\nand sixty cubic centimeters of water in a beaker and heat to boiling.\r\nAdd twenty-five cubic centimeters of the solution of the material to\r\nbe examined, which must be so prepared as not to contain more than one\r\nper cent of dextrose, and boil for two minutes. Filter immediately\r\nafter adding an equal volume of recently boiled cold water and obtain\r\nthe weight of copper by one of the gravimetric methods given. The\r\ncorresponding weight of dextrose is found by the following table:\r\n\r\n    ALLIHN’S TABLE FOR THE DETERMINATION OF DEXTROSE.\r\n\r\n    (A) = Milligrams of copper.\r\n    (B) = Milligrams of

Meissl’s Table for Invert Sugar.=—Invert sugar is usually the\r\nproduct of the hydrolysis of sucrose. The following table is to be used\r\nwhen the hydrolysis is complete, _i_. _e_., when no sucrose is left\r\nin the solution. The solution of copper sulfate and of the alkaline\r\ntartrate are made up as follows: 34.64 grams of copper sulfate in half\r\na liter, and 173 grams of rochelle salt and 51.6 grams sodium hydroxid\r\nin the same volume. The quantity of sugar solution used must not\r\ncontain more than 245 nor less than ninety milligrams of invert sugar.\r\n\r\nIn the determination twenty-five cubic centimeters of the copper\r\nsolution and an equal volume of the alkaline tartrate are mixed and\r\nboiled, the proper amount of sugar solution added to secure a quantity\r\nof invertose within the limits named, the volume completed to 100\r\ncubic centimeters with boiling water, and the mixture kept in lively\r\nebullition for two minutes. An equal volume of recently boiled cold\r\nwater is added and the cuprous oxid at once separated by filtration on\r\nasbestos under pressure, and washed free of alkali with boiling water.\r\nThe metallic copper is secured by one of the methods already described.\r\n\r\n    TABLE FOR INVERT SUGAR BY MEISSL AND WIEN.[107]\r\n\r\n       (A) = Milligrams of copper.\r\n       (B) = Milligrams of

Table for the Determination of Invert Sugar (Reducing Sugars)\r\nin the Presence of Sucrose.=—The method adopted by the Association of\r\nOfficial Agricultural Chemists is essentially that proposed by Meissl\r\nand Hiller.[108] Prepare a solution of the material to be examined in\r\nsuch a manner that it contains twenty grams of the mixed sugars in\r\none hundred cubic centimeters, after clarification and the removal of\r\nthe excess of lead. Prepare a series of solutions in large test tubes\r\nby adding one, two, three, four, five etc. cubic centimeters of this\r\nsolution to each tube successively. Add five cubic centimeters of the\r\nmixed copper reagent to each, heat to boiling, boil two minutes and\r\nfilter. Note the volume of sugar solution which gives the filtrate\r\nlightest in tint, but still distinctly blue. Place twenty times this\r\nvolume of the sugar solution in a 100 cubic centimeter flask, dilute to\r\nthe mark, and mix well. Use fifty cubic centimeters of the solution for\r\nthe determination, which is conducted as already described, until the\r\nweight of copper is obtained. For the calculation of the results use\r\nthe following formulas and table of factors of Meissl and Hiller:[109]\r\n\r\n    Let         Cu = the weight of the copper obtained;\r\n                 P = the polarization of the sample;\r\n                 W = the weight of the sample in the fifty cubic\r\n                     centimeters of the solution used for determination;\r\n                 F = the factor obtained from the table for conversion\r\n                     of copper to invert sugar;\r\n               Cu\r\n              ---- = approximate absolute weight of invert sugar = Z;\r\n                2\r\n\r\n              100\r\n         Z × ----- = approximate per cent of invert sugar = _y_;\r\n               W\r\n\r\n           100P\r\n          ------- = R, relative number for sucrose;\r\n          P + _y_\r\n\r\n           100 - R = I, relative number for invert sugar;\r\n\r\n               Cu\r\n              ---- = per cent of invert sugar.\r\n               W\r\n\r\nZ indicates the vertical column, and the ratio of R to I, the\r\nhorizontal column of the table, which are to be used for the purpose of\r\nfinding the factor (F) for calculating copper to invert sugar.\r\n\r\n_Example_:—The polarization of a sugar is 86.4, and 3.256 grams of it\r\n(W) are equivalent to 0.290 gram of copper. Then:\r\n\r\n          Cu    0.290\r\n         ---- = ----- = 0.145 = Z\r\n          2       2\r\n\r\n         100             100\r\n    Z × ----- = 0.145 × ------ = 4.45 = _y_\r\n          W              3.256\r\n\r\n       100P          8640\r\n     -------- = ------------ = 95.1 = R\r\n      P + _y_    86.4 + 4.45\r\n\r\n      100 - R = 100 - 95.1 = 4.9 = I\r\n\r\n        R : I = 95.1 : 4.9\r\n\r\nBy consulting the table it will be seen that the vertical column headed\r\nI = 150 is nearest to Z, 145, the horizontal column headed 95: 5 is\r\nnearest to the ratio of R to I, 95.1: 4.9. Where these columns meet we\r\nfind the factor 51.2, which enters into the final calculation:\r\n\r\n     CuF     .290 × 51.2\r\n    ----- = ------------- = 4.56 the true per cent of invert sugar.\r\n      W        3.256\r\n\r\n    MEISSL AND HILLER’S FACTORS FOR THE DETERMINATION OF\r\n           MORE THAN ONE PER CENT OF INVERT SUGAR.\r\n\r\n    Ratio of    Approximate absolute weight of invert sugar = _Z_.\r\n     sucrose     I =     I =     I =     I =     I =     I =     I =\r\n    to invert    200     175     150     125     100     75      50\r\n     sugar =      mg.    mg.     mg.      mg.     mg.    mg.     mg.\r\n     R : I.\r\n     0 : 100    56.4    55.4    54.5    53.8    53.2    53.0    53.0\r\n    10 : 90     56.3    55.3    54.4    53.8    53.2    52.9    52.9\r\n    20 : 80     56.2    55.2    54.3    53.7    53.2    52.7    52.7\r\n    30 : 70     56.1    55.1    54.2    53.7    53.2    52.6    52.6\r\n    40 : 60     55.9    55.0    54.1    53.6    53.1    52.5    52.4\r\n    50 : 50     55.7    54.9    54.0    53.5    53.1    52.3    52.2\r\n    60 : 40     55.6    54.7    53.8    53.2    52.8    52.1    51.9\r\n    70 : 30     55.5    54.5    53.5    52.9    52.5    51.9    51.6\r\n    80 : 20     55.4    54.3    53.3    52.7    52.2    51.7    51.3\r\n    90 : 10     54.6    53.6    53.1    52.6    52.1    51.6    51.2\r\n    91 : 9      54.1    53.6    52.6    52.1    51.6    51.2    50.7\r\n    92 : 8      53.6    53.1    52.1    51.6    51.2    50.7    50.3\r\n    93 : 7      53.6    53.1    52.1    51.2    50.7    50.3    49.8\r\n    94 : 6      53.1    52.6    51.6    50.7    50.3    49.8    48.9\r\n    95 : 5      52.6    52.1    51.2    50.3    49.4    48.9    48.5\r\n    96 : 4      52.1    51.2    50.7    49.8    48.9    47.7    46.9\r\n    97 : 3      50.7    50.3    49.8    48.9    47.7    46.2    45.1\r\n    98 : 2      49.9    48.9    48.5    47.3    45.8    43.3    40.0\r\n    99 : 1      47.7    47.3    46.5    45.1    43.3    41.2    38.1\r\n\r\n=143. Table for the Estimation of Milk Sugar.=—The solutions to be used\r\nfor this table are the same as those employed in the preceding table\r\nfor the estimation of invert sugar. The milk sugar is supposed to be in\r\na pure form in solution before beginning the analysis. The method to be\r\nemployed for milk will be given in the part devoted to dairy products.\r\n\r\nIn the conduct of the work twenty-five cubic centimeters of the copper\r\nsolution are mixed with an equal quantity of the alkaline tartrate\r\nmixture, and from twenty to one hundred cubic centimeters of the sugar\r\nsolution added, according to its concentration. This solution should\r\nnot contain less than seventy nor more than 306 milligrams of lactose.\r\nThe volume is completed to 150 cubic centimeters with boiling water and\r\nkept in lively ebullition for six minutes. The rest of the operation is\r\nconducted in the manner already described. From the weight of copper\r\nobtained the quantity of milk sugar is determined by inspecting the\r\ntable. It is recommended to use such a weight of milk sugar as will\r\ngive about 200 milligrams of copper.\r\n\r\n    TABLE FOR DETERMINING MILK SUGAR.\r\n\r\n        (A) = Milligrams of copper.\r\n        (B) = Milligrams of milk sugar.\r\n\r\n    (A)    (B)    (A)   (B)     (A)   (B)     (A)   (B)\r\n    100   71.6    120   86.4    140  101.3    160  116.4\r\n    101   72.4    121   87.2    141  102.0    161  117.1\r\n    102   73.1    122   87.9    142  102.8    162  117.9\r\n    103   73.8    123   88.7    143  103.5    163  118.6\r\n    104   74.6    124   89.4    144  104.3    164  119.4\r\n    105   75.3    125   90.1    145  105.1    165  120.2\r\n    106   76.1    126   90.9    146  105.8    166  120.9\r\n    107   76.8    127   91.6    147  106.6    167  121.7\r\n    108   77.6    128   92.4    148  107.3    168  122.4\r\n    109   78.3    129   93.1    149  108.1    169  123.2\r\n    110   79.0    130   93.8    150  108.8    170  123.9\r\n    111   79.8    131   94.6    151  109.6    171  124.7\r\n    112   80.5    132   95.3    152  110.3    172  125.5\r\n    113   81.3    133   96.1    153  111.1    173  126.2\r\n    114   82.0    134   96.9    154  111.9    174  127.0\r\n    115   82.7    135   97.6    155  112.6    175  127.8\r\n    116   83.5    136   98.3    156  113.4    176  128.5\r\n    117   84.2    137   99.1    157  114.1    177  129.3\r\n    118   85.0    138   99.8    158  114.9    178  130.1\r\n    119   85.7    139  100.5    159  115.6    179  130.8\r\n\r\n    (A)    (B)    (A)   (B)     (A)   (B)     (A)   (B)\r\n    180  131.6    223  164.2    266  197.2    309  231.4\r\n    181  132.4    224  164.9    267  198.0    310  232.2\r\n    182  133.1    225  165.7    268  198.8    311  232.9\r\n    183  133.9    226  166.4    269  199.5    312  233.7\r\n    184  134.7    227  167.2    270  200.3    313  234.5\r\n    185  135.4    228  167.9    271  201.1    314  235.3\r\n    186  136.2    229  168.6    272  201.9    315  236.1\r\n    187  137.0    230  169.4    273  202.7    316  236.8\r\n    188  137.7    231  170.1    274  203.5    317  237.6\r\n    189  138.5    232  170.9    275  204.3    318  238.4\r\n    190  139.3    233  171.6    276  205.1    319  239.2\r\n    191  140.0    234  172.4    277  205.9    320  240.0\r\n    192  140.8    235  173.1    278  206.7    321  240.7\r\n    193  141.6    236  173.9    279  207.5    322  241.5\r\n    194  142.3    237  174.6    280  208.3    323  242.3\r\n    195  143.1    238  175.4    281  209.1    324  243.1\r\n    196  143.9    239  176.2    282  209.9    325  243.9\r\n    197  144.6    240  176.9    283  210.7    326  244.6\r\n    198  145.4    241  177.7    284  211.5    327  245.4\r\n    199  146.2    242  178.5    285  212.3    328  246.2\r\n    200  146.9    243  179.3    286  213.1    329  247.0\r\n    201  147.7    244  180.1    287  213.9    330  247.7\r\n    202  148.5    245  180.8    288  214.7    331  248.5\r\n    203  149.2    246  181.6    289  215.5    332  249.2\r\n    204  150.0    247  182.4    290  216.3    333  250.0\r\n    205  150.7    248  183.2    291  217.1    334  250.8\r\n    206  151.5    249  184.0    292  217.9    335  251.6\r\n    207  152.2    250  184.8    293  218.7    336  252.5\r\n    208  153.0    251  185.5    294  219.5    337  253.3\r\n    209  153.7    252  186.3    295  220.3    338  254.1\r\n    210  154.5    253  187.1    296  221.1    339  254.9\r\n    211  155.2    254  187.9    297  221.9    340  255.7\r\n    212  156.0    255  188.7    298  222.7    341  256.5\r\n    213  156.7    256  189.4    299  223.5    342  257.4\r\n    214  157.5    257  190.2    300  224.4    343  258.2\r\n    215  158.2    258  191.0    301  225.2    344  259.0\r\n    216  159.0    259  191.8    302  225.9    345  259.8\r\n    217  159.7    260  192.5    303  226.7    346  260.6\r\n    218  160.4    261  193.3    304  227.5    347  261.4\r\n    219  161.2    262  194.1    305  228.3    348  262.3\r\n    220  161.9    263  194.9    306  229.1    349  263.1\r\n    221  162.7    264  195.7    307  229.8    350  263.9\r\n    222  163.4    265  196.4    308  230.6    351  264.7\r\n\r\n    (A)    (B)    (A)   (B)     (A)   (B)     (A)   (B)\r\n    352  265.5    365  276.2    377  286.5    389  296.8\r\n    353  266.3    366  277.1    378  287.4    390  297.7\r\n    354  267.2    367  277.9    379  288.2    391  298.5\r\n    355  268.0    368  278.8    380  289.1    392  299.4\r\n    356  268.8    369  279.6    381  289.9    393  300.3\r\n    357  269.6    370  280.5    382  290.8    394  301.1\r\n    358  270.4    371  281.4    383  291.7    395  302.0\r\n    359  271.2    372  282.2    384  292.5    396  302.8\r\n    360  272.1    373  283.1    385  293.4    397  303.7\r\n    361  272.9    374  283.9    386  294.2    398  304.6\r\n    362  273.7    375  284.8    387  295.1    399  305.4\r\n    363  274.5    376  285.7    388  296.0    400  306.3\r\n    364  275.3\r\n\r\n=144. Table for the Determination of Maltose.=—The copper and alkaline\r\nsolutions employed for the oxidation of maltose are the same as those\r\nused for invert and milk sugars.\r\n\r\nIn the manipulation twenty-five cubic centimeters each of the copper\r\nand alkali solutions are mixed and boiled and an equal volume of the\r\nmaltose solution added, which should not contain more than one per\r\ncent of the sugar. The boiling is continued for four minutes, an equal\r\nvolume of cold recently boiled water added, the cuprous oxid separated\r\nby filtration and the metallic copper obtained in the manner already\r\ndescribed. The weight of maltose oxidized is then ascertained from the\r\ntable.\r\n\r\n     _Example._ Weight of impure maltose taken, ten grams to a liter:\r\n        Quantity used, twenty-five cubic centimeters:\r\n        Weight of copper obtained 268 milligrams:\r\n        Weight of maltose oxidized 237 milligrams:\r\n        Weight of impure maltose taken 250 milligrams:\r\n        Percentage of maltose in sample 94.8.\r\n\r\n      TABLE FOR MALTOSE.\r\n\r\n        (A) = Milligrams of copper.\r\n        (B) = Milligrams of maltose.\r\n\r\n     (A)   (B)   (A)   (B)    (A)   (B)    (A)   (B)\r\n     30   25.3    35   29.6    40   33.9    45   38.3\r\n     31   26.1    36   30.5    41   34.8    46   39.1\r\n     32   27.0    37   31.3    42   35.7    47   40.0\r\n     33   27.9    38   32.2    43   36.5    48   40.9\r\n     34   28.7    39   33.1    44   37.4    49   41.8\r\n\r\n     (A)   (B)   (A)   (B)    (A)   (B)    (A)   (B)\r\n     50   42.6    94   81.2   138  120.6   182  160.1\r\n     51   43.5    95   82.1   139  121.5   183  160.9\r\n     52   44.4    96   83.0   140  122.4   184  161.8\r\n     53   45.2    97   83.9   141  123.3   185  162.7\r\n     54   46.1    98   84.8   142  124.2   186  163.6\r\n     55   47.0    99   85.7   143  125.1   187  164.5\r\n     56   47.8   100   86.6   144  126.0   188  165.4\r\n     57   48.7   101   87.5   145  126.9   189  166.3\r\n     58   49.6   102   88.4   146  127.8   190  167.2\r\n     59   50.4   103   89.2   147  128.7   191  168.1\r\n     60   51.3   104   90.1   148  129.6   192  169.0\r\n     61   52.2   105   91.0   149  130.5   193  169.8\r\n     62   53.1   106   91.9   150  131.4   194  170.7\r\n     63   53.9   107   92.8   151  132.3   195  171.6\r\n     64   54.8   108   93.7   152  133.2   196  172.5\r\n     65   55.7   109   94.6   153  134.1   197  173.4\r\n     66   56.6   110   95.5   154  135.0   198  174.3\r\n     67   57.4   111   96.4   155  135.9   199  175.2\r\n     68   58.3   112   97.3   156  136.8   200  176.1\r\n     69   59.2   113   98.1   157  137.7   201  177.0\r\n     70   60.1   114   99.0   158  138.6   202  177.9\r\n     71   61.0   115   99.9   159  139.5   203  178.7\r\n     72   61.8   116  100.8   160  140.4   204  179.6\r\n     73   62.7   117  101.7   161  141.3   205  180.5\r\n     74   63.6   118  102.6   162  142.2   206  181.4\r\n     75   64.5   119  103.5   163  143.1   207  182.3\r\n     76   65.4   120  104.4   164  144.0   208  183.2\r\n     77   66.2   121  105.3   165  144.9   209  184.1\r\n     78   67.1   122  106.2   166  145.8   210  185.0\r\n     79   68.0   123  107.1   167  146.7   211  185.9\r\n     80   68.9   124  108.0   168  147.6   212  186.8\r\n     81   69.7   125  108.9   169  148.5   213  187.7\r\n     82   70.6   126  109.8   170  149.4   214  188.6\r\n     83   71.5   127  110.7   171  150.3   215  189.5\r\n     84   72.4   128  111.6   172  151.2   216  190.4\r\n     85   73.2   129  112.5   173  152.0   217  191.2\r\n     86   74.1   130  113.4   174  152.9   218  192.1\r\n     87   75.0   131  114.3   175  153.8   219  193.0\r\n     88   75.9   132  115.2   176  154.7   220  193.9\r\n     89   76.8   133  116.1   177  155.6   221  194.8\r\n     90   77.7   134  117.0   178  156.5   222  195.7\r\n     91   78.6   135  117.9   179  157.4   223  196.6\r\n     92   79.5   136  118.8   180  158.3   224  197.5\r\n     93   80.3   137  119.7   181  159.2   225  198.4\r\n\r\n     (A)   (B)   (A)   (B)    (A)   (B)    (A)   (B)\r\n    226  199.3   245  216.3   264  233.4   283  250.4\r\n    227  200.2   246  217.2   265  234.3   284  251.3\r\n    228  201.1   247  218.1   266  235.2   285  252.2\r\n    229  202.0   248  219.0   267  236.1   286  253.1\r\n    230  202.9   249  219.9   268  237.0   287  254.0\r\n    231  203.8   250  220.8   269  237.9   288  254.9\r\n    232  204.7   251  221.7   270  238.8   289  255.8\r\n    233  205.6   252  222.6   271  239.7   290  256.6\r\n    234  206.5   253  223.5   272  240.6   291  257.5\r\n    235  207.4   254  224.4   273  241.5   292  258.4\r\n    236  208.3   255  225.3   274  242.4   293  259.3\r\n    237  209.1   256  226.2   275  243.3   294  260.2\r\n    238  210.0   257  227.1   276  244.2   295  261.1\r\n    239  210.9   258  228.0   277  245.1   296  262.0\r\n    240  211.8   259  228.9   278  246.0   297  262.8\r\n    241  212.7   260  229.8   279  246.9   298  263.7\r\n    242  213.6   261  230.7   280  247.8   299  264.6\r\n    243  214.5   262  231.6   281  248.7   300  265.5\r\n    244  215.4   263  232.5   282  249.6\r\n\r\n=145. Preparation of Levulose.=—It is not often that levulose, unmixed\r\nwith other reducing sugars, is brought to the attention of the analyst.\r\nIt probably does not exist in the unmixed state in any agricultural\r\nproduct. The easiest method of preparing it is by the hydrolysis of\r\ninulin. A nearly pure levulose has also lately been placed on the\r\nmarket under the name of diabetin. It is prepared from invert sugar.\r\n\r\nInulin is prepared from dahlia bulbs by boiling the pulp with water\r\nand a trace of calcium carbonate. The extract is concentrated to\r\na sirup and subjected to a freezing temperature to promote the\r\ncrystallization of the inulin. The separated product is subjected to\r\nthe above operations several times until it is pure and colorless. It\r\nis then washed with alcohol and ether and is reduced to a fine powder.\r\nBefore the repeated treatment with water it is advisable to clarify\r\nthe solution with lead subacetate. The lead is afterwards removed by\r\nhydrogen sulfid and the resultant acetic acid neutralized with calcium\r\ncarbonate.\r\n\r\nBy the action of hot dilute acids inulin is rapidly converted into\r\nlevulose.\r\n\r\nLevulose may also be prepared from invert sugar, but in this case it\r\nis difficult to free it from traces of dextrose. The most successful\r\nmethod consists in forming a lime compound with the invert sugar and\r\nseparating the lime levulosate and dextrosate by their difference\r\nin solubility. The levulose salt is much less soluble than the\r\ncorresponding compound of dextrose. In the manufacture of levulose\r\nfrom beet molasses, the latter is dissolved in six times its weight of\r\nwater and inverted with a quantity of hydrochloric acid, proportioned\r\nto the quantity of ash present in the sample. After inversion the\r\nmixture is cooled to zero and the levulose precipitated by adding\r\nfine-ground lime. The dextrose and coloring matters in these conditions\r\nare not thrown down. The precipitated lime levulosate is separated by\r\nfiltration and washed with ice-cold water. The lime salt is afterwards\r\nbeaten to a cream with water and decomposed by carbon dioxid. The\r\nlevulose, after filtration, is concentrated to the crystallizing\r\npoint.[110]\r\n\r\n=146. Estimation of Levulose.=—Levulose, when free of any admixture\r\nwith other reducing sugars, may be determined by the copper method\r\nwith the use of the subjoined table, prepared by Lehmann.[111] The\r\ncopper solution is the same as that used for invert sugar, _viz._,\r\n69.278 grams of pure copper sulfate in one liter. The alkali solution\r\nis prepared by dissolving 346 grams of rochelle salt and 250 grams of\r\nsodium hydroxid in water and completing the volume to one liter.\r\n\r\n_Manipulation._—Twenty-five cubic centimeters of each solution\r\nare mixed with fifty of water and boiled. To the boiling mixture\r\ntwenty-five cubic centimeters of the levulose solution are added, which\r\nmust not contain more than one per cent of the sugar. The boiling is\r\nthen continued for fifteen minutes, and the cuprous oxid collected,\r\nwashed and reduced to the metallic state in the usual way. The quantity\r\nof levulose is then determined by inspection from the table given\r\nbelow. Other methods of determining levulose in mixtures will be given\r\nfurther on.\r\n\r\n    TABLE FOR THE ESTIMATION OF LEVULOSE.\r\n\r\n        (A) = Milligrams of copper.\r\n        (B) = Milligrams

Precipitation of Sugars with Phenylhydrazin=.—The combination of\r\nphenylhydrazin with aldehyds and ketones was first studied by Fischer,\r\nand the near relationship of these bodies to sugar soon led to the\r\ninvestigation of the compounds formed thereby with this reagent.[112]\r\nReducing sugars form with phenylhydrazin insoluble crystalline bodies,\r\nto which the name osazones has been given. The reaction which takes\r\nplace is a double one and is represented by the following formulas:\r\n\r\n    Dextrose. Phenylhydrazin.  Dextrose-phenylhydrazone.\r\n\r\n    C₆H₁₂O₆  +  C₆H₅NH.NH₂    =  C₆H₁₂O₅.N.NHC₆H₅ + H₂O\r\n         and C₆H₁₂O₅.N.NHC₆H₅ + C₆H₅NH.NH₂ =\r\n                 Phenyldextrosazone.\r\n               C₆H₁₀O₄(N.NHC₆H₅)₂ + 2H₂O.\r\n\r\nThe dextrosazone is commonly called glucosazone. The osazones formed\r\nwith the commonly occurring reducing sugars are crystalline, stable,\r\ninsoluble bodies which can be easily separated from any attending\r\nimpurities and identified by their melting points. Glucosazone melts at\r\n205°, lactosazone at 200° and maltosazone at 206°.\r\n\r\nThe osazones are precipitated in the following way: The reducing sugar,\r\nin about ten per cent solution, is treated with an excess of the\r\nacetate of phenylhydrazin in acetic acid and warmed to from 75° to 85°.\r\nIn a short time the separation is complete and the yellow precipitate\r\nformed is washed, dried and weighed. The sugar can be recovered from\r\nthe osazone by decomposing it with strong hydrochloric acid by means\r\nof which the phenylhydrazin is displaced and a body, osone, is formed,\r\nwhich by treatment with zinc dust and acetic acid, is reduced to the\r\noriginal sugar. The reactions which take place are represented by the\r\nfollowing equations:[113]\r\n\r\n                                 Glucososone.\r\n    C₆H₁₀O₄(N.NH.C₆H₅)₂ + 2H₂O =    C₆H₁₀O₆   + 2C₆H₅N₂H₂\r\n\r\n                                Dextrose (Glucose).\r\n                  C₆H₁₀O₆ + H₂ = C₆H₁₂O₆.\r\n\r\nFor the complete precipitation of dextrose as osazone Lintner and\r\nKröber show that the solution of dextrose should not contain more than\r\none gram in 100 cubic centimeters. Twenty cubic centimeters containing\r\n0.2 gram dextrose should be used for the precipitation.[114] To this\r\nsolution should be added one gram of phenylhydrazin and one gram of\r\nfifty per cent acetic acid. The solution is then to be warmed for about\r\ntwo hours and the precipitate washed with from sixty to eighty cubic\r\ncentimeters of hot water and dried for three hours at 105°. One part\r\nof the osazone is equivalent to one part of dextrose when maltose and\r\ndextrin are absent. When these are present the proportion is one part\r\nof osazone to 1.04 of dextrose. Where levulose is precipitated instead\r\nof dextrose 1.43 parts of the osazone are equal to one part of the\r\nsugar.\r\n\r\nSucrose is scarcely at all precipitated as osazone until inverted.\r\n\r\nAfter inversion and precipitation as above, 1.33 parts osazone are\r\nequal to one part of sucrose.\r\n\r\nThe reaction with phenylhydrazin has not been much used for quantitive\r\nestimations of sugars, but it has been found especially useful in\r\nidentifying and separating reducing sugars. It is altogether probable,\r\nhowever, that in the near future phenylhydrazin will become a common\r\nreagent for sugar work.\r\n\r\nMaquenne has studied the action of phenylhydrazin on sugars and\r\nconsiders that this reaction offers the only known means of\r\nprecipitating these bodies from solutions where they are found mixed\r\nwith other substances.[115] The osazones, which are thus obtained, are\r\nusually very slightly soluble in the ordinary reagents, for which\r\nreason it is easy to obtain them pure when there is at the disposition\r\nof the analyst a sufficient quantity of the material. But if the sugar\r\nto be studied is rare and if it contain, moreover, several distinct\r\nreducing bodies, the task is more delicate. It is easy then to confound\r\nseveral osazones which have almost identical points of fusion;\r\nfor example, glucosazone with galactosazone. Finally, it becomes\r\nimpossible by the employment of phenylhydrazin to distinguish glucose,\r\ndextrose or mannose from levulose alone or mixed with its isomers.\r\nIndeed, these three sugars give, with the acetate of phenylhydrazin\r\nthe same phenylglucosazone which melts at about 205°. It is noticed\r\nthat the weights of osazones which are precipitated when different\r\nsugars are heated for the same time with the same quantity of the\r\nphenylhydrazin, vary within extremely wide limits. It is constant for\r\neach kind of sugar if the conditions under which the precipitation\r\nis made are rigorously the same. There is then, in the weight of the\r\nosazones produced, a new characteristic of particular value. The\r\nfollowing numbers have been obtained by heating for one hour at 100°,\r\none gram of sugar with 100 cubic centimeters of water and five cubic\r\ncentimeters of a solution containing forty grams of phenylhydrazin\r\nand forty grams of acetic acid per hundred. After cooling the liquid,\r\nthe osazones are received upon a weighed filter, washed with 100\r\ncubic centimeters of water, dried at 110° and weighed. The weights of\r\nosazones obtained are given in the following table:\r\n\r\n                             Weight of the osazones.\r\n    Character of the sugar.           gram.\r\n\r\n    Sorbine, crystallized             0.82\r\n    Levulose      ”                   0.70\r\n    Xylose        ”                   0.40\r\n    Glucose, anhydrous                0.32\r\n    Arabinose, crystallized           0.27\r\n    Galactose       ”                 0.23\r\n    Rhamnose        ”                 0.15\r\n    Lactose         ”                 0.11\r\n    Maltose         ”                 0.11\r\n\r\nWith solutions twice as dilute as those above, the relative conditions\r\nare still more sensible, and the different sugars arrange themselves in\r\nthe same order, with the exception of levulose, which shows a slight\r\nadvantage over sorbine and acquires the first rank. From the above\r\ndeterminations, it is shown that levulose and sorbine give vastly\r\ngreater quantities of osazones, under given conditions, than the other\r\nreducing sugars. It would be easy, therefore, to distinguish them by\r\nthis reaction and to recognize their presence also even in very complex\r\nmixtures, where the polarimetric examination alone would furnish only\r\nuncertain indications.\r\n\r\nIt is remarkable that these two sugars are the only ones among the\r\nisomers or the homologues of dextrose, actually known, which possess\r\nthe functions of an acetone. They are not, however, easily confounded,\r\nsince the glucosazone forms beautiful needles which are ordinarily\r\nvisible to the naked eye, while the sorbinosazone is still oily and\r\nwhen heated never gives perfectly distinct crystals.\r\n\r\nThis method also enables us to distinguish between dextrose and\r\ngalactose, of which the osazone is well crystallized and melts at\r\nalmost the same temperature as the phenylglucosazone. Finally, it\r\nis observed that the reducing sugars give less of osazones than the\r\nsugars which are not capable of hydrolysis, and consequently differ\r\nin their inversion products. It is specially noticed in this study of\r\nthe polyglucoses (bioses, trioses), that this new method of employing\r\nthe phenylhydrazin appears very advantageous. It is sufficient to\r\ncompare the weights of the osazones to that which is given under the\r\nsame conditions by a known glucose, in order to have a very certain\r\nverification of the probabilities of the result of the chemical or\r\noptical examination of the mixture which is under study. All the\r\npolyglucoses which have been examined from this point of view give\r\nvery decided results. The numbers which follow have reference to one\r\ngram of sugar completely inverted by dilute sulfuric acid, dissolved\r\nin 100 cubic centimeters of water, and treated with two grams of\r\nphenylhydrazin, the same quantity of acetic acid, and five grams of\r\ncrystallized sodium acetate. All these solutions have been compared\r\nwith the artificial mixtures and corresponding glucoses, with the same\r\nquantities of the same reagents. The following are the results of the\r\nexamination:\r\n\r\n                                                  Weight of the osazone.\r\n        Character of the sugar.                           gram.\r\n\r\n    1 {Saccharose, ordinary                               0.71\r\n      {Glucose and levulose (.526 g each)                 0.73\r\n\r\n    2 {Maltose                                            0.55\r\n      {Glucose (1.052 g)                                  0.58\r\n\r\n    3 {Raffinose, crystallized                            0.48\r\n      {Levulose, glucose and galactose (.333 g each)      0.53\r\n\r\n    4 {Lactose, crystallized                              0.38\r\n      {Glucose and galactose (.500 g each)                0.39\r\n\r\nIt is noticed that the agreement for each saccharose is as\r\nsatisfactory as possible. Numbers obtained with the products of\r\ninversion are always a little low by reason of the destructive action\r\nof sulfuric acid, and in particular, upon levulose. This is, moreover,\r\nquite sensible when the product has to be heated for a long time with\r\nsulfuric acid in order to secure a complete inversion. It is evident\r\nfrom the data cited from the papers of Fischer, Maquenne, and others,\r\nthat the determination of sugars by this method is not a very difficult\r\nanalytical process and may, in the near future, become of great\r\npractical importance.\r\n\r\n=148. Molecular Weights of Carbohydrates.=—In the examination of\r\ncarbohydrates the determination of the molecular weights is often of\r\nthe highest analytical value.\r\n\r\nThe uncertainty in respect of the true molecular weights of the\r\ncarbohydrates is gradually disappearing by reason of the insight into\r\nthe composition of these bodies, which recently discovered physical\r\nrelations have permitted.\r\n\r\nRaoult, many years ago,[116] proposed a method of determining molecular\r\nweights which is particularly applicable to carbohydrates soluble in\r\nwater.\r\n\r\nThe principle of Raoult’s discovery may be stated as follows: The\r\ndepression of the freezing point of a liquid, caused by the presence of\r\na dissolved liquid or solid, is proportionate to the absolute amount of\r\nsubstance dissolved and inversely proportionate to its molecular weight.\r\n\r\nThe following formulas may be used in computing results:\r\n\r\n_C_ = observed depression of freezing point:\r\n\r\n_P_ = weight of anhydrous substance in 100 grams:\r\n\r\n    _C_\r\n    --- = _A_ = depression produced by one gram substance in 100 grams:\r\n    _P_\r\n\r\n_K_ = depression produced by dissolving in 100 cubic centimeters a\r\nnumber of grams of the substance corresponding to its molecular weight:\r\n\r\n_M_ = molecular weight:\r\n\r\n                        _C_\r\n    Then we have, _K_ = ---- × _M_.\r\n                        _P_\r\n\r\n_K_ is a quantity varying with the nature of the solvent but with\r\nthe same solvent remaining sensibly constant for numerous groups of\r\ncompounds.\r\n\r\nThe value of\r\n\r\n        _C_\r\n    _A_ ----\r\n        _P_\r\n\r\ncan be determined by experiment. The molecular weight can therefore be\r\ncalculated from the formula\r\n\r\n          _K_\r\n    _M_ = ----.\r\n          _A_\r\n\r\nWith organic compounds in water the value of _K_ is almost constant.\r\n\r\nBrown and Morris[117] report results of their work in extending Raoult’s\r\ninvestigations of the molecular weight of the carbohydrates. The\r\nprocess is carried on as follows:\r\n\r\nA solution of the carbohydrate is prepared containing a known weight\r\nof the substance in 100 cubic centimeters of water. About 120 cubic\r\ncentimeters of the solution are introduced into a thin beaker of about\r\n400 capacity. This beaker is closed with a stopper with three holes.\r\nThrough one of these a glass rod for stirring the solution is inserted.\r\nThe second perforation carries a delicate thermometer graduated to\r\n0°.05. The temperature is read with a telescope. The beaker is placed\r\nin a mixture of ice and brine at a temperature from 2° to 3° below\r\nthe freezing point of the solution. The solution is cooled until its\r\ntemperature is from 0°.5 to 1° below the point of congelation. Through\r\nthe third aperture in the stopper a small lump of ice taken from a\r\nfrozen portion of the same solution, is dropped, causing at once the\r\nfreezing process to begin. The liquid is briskly stirred and as the\r\ncongelation goes on the temperature rises and finally becomes constant.\r\nThe reading is then taken. The depression in the freezing point,\r\ncontrolled by the strength of the solution, should never be more than\r\nfrom 1° to 2°.\r\n\r\nThe molecular weights may also be determined by the boiling points of\r\ntheir solutions as indicated by the author,[118] Beckmann,[119] Hite,\r\nOrndorff and Cameron.[120]\r\n\r\nThe method applied to some of the more important carbohydrates gave the\r\nfollowing results:\r\n\r\n               DEXTROSE.\r\n\r\n     Calculated for C₆H₁₂O₆.

The authors supposed that\r\nthis phenomenon might have some relation to the size of the molecule.\r\nThey, therefore, determined the molecular volume of freshly dissolved\r\ndextrose by the method of Raoult and found _M_ = 180. The high rotatory\r\npower of recently dissolved dextrose is therefore not due to any\r\nvariation in the size of its molecule.\r\n\r\nThe mathematical theory of birotation is given by Müller as\r\nfollows.[121] In proportion as the unstable modification _A_ is\r\ntransformed into the stable modification _B_, the rotation will vary.\r\nLet ρ = the specific rotatory power of _B_ and _a_ρ = that of _A_, both\r\nin the anhydrous state. Let now _p_ grams of the substance be dissolved\r\nin _V_ cubic centimeters of solvent and observed in a tube _l_\r\ndecimeters in length. The time from making the solution is represented\r\nby θ. The angle of rotation α is read at the time θ. Let _x_ = the mass\r\nof _A_, and _y_ = that of _B_, and the equation is derived.\r\n\r\n         _a_ρ_xl_    ρ_yl_\r\n    α = --------- + ------:\r\n           _V_        _V_\r\n\r\n    But _x_ + _y_ = _p_\r\n\r\n                                    ρ_l_\r\n    whence α = [(_a_ - 1)_x_ + _p_] ----.\r\n                                    _V_\r\n\r\nIf now there be introduced into the calculation the final angle of\r\nrotation αₙ, which can be determined with great exactness; we have\r\n\r\n          _p_ρ_l_                            (_a_ - 1)_x_\r\n     αₙ = ------- and consequently α = αₙ[1 + ------------],\r\n            _V_                                  _p_\r\n\r\n           (_a_ - 1)_x_     α\r\n    whence ------------- = --- - 1.\r\n               _p_          αₙ\r\n\r\nThis equation gives the quantity _x_ of the unstable matter which is\r\ntransformed into the stable modification in the time θ.\r\n\r\nIt must be admitted that the quantity _dx_ which is changed during the\r\ninfinitely small time _d_θ is proportional to the mass _x_ which still\r\nexists at the moment θ, whence _dx_ = -Cʹ_xd_θ where Cʹ represents a\r\nconstant positive factor. From this is derived the equation\r\n\r\n    _dx_\r\n    ----- = -Cʹ_d_θ.\r\n    _x_\r\n\r\nIntegrating and calling _x_ the quantity of matter changed to the\r\nstable form at the moment θ, corresponding to a rotation α₀, we have\r\n\r\n            1              _x_₀\r\n    Cʹ = ------- log. nap. ----, and taking into consideration\r\n          θ - θ₀           _x_\r\n\r\nthe equation given above, and substituting common for superior\r\nlogarithms we get\r\n\r\n            1           α₀ - αₙ\r\n    C = --------- log. ---------.\r\n          θ - θ₀         α - αₙ\r\n\r\nExperience has shown that such a constant C really exists, and\r\nits value can be easily calculated from the data of Parcus and\r\nTollens.[122] The mean value of C from these data is 0.0301 for\r\narabinose; 0.0201 for xylose; 0.0393 for rhamnose; 0.0202 for fucose;\r\n0.00927 for galactose; 0.00405 for lactose; 0.00524 for maltose, and\r\nfor dextrose, 0.00348 at 11° to 13° and 0.00398 from 13° to 15°. The\r\nconstant C as is well known, increases as the temperature is raised.\r\n\r\nThe constant C, at a given temperature, measures the progress of the\r\nphenomenon of the change from the unstable to the stable state. It will\r\nbe noticed that among the sugars possessing multirotation properties\r\nthe pentoses possess a much higher speed of transformation than the\r\nothers.\r\n\r\n=150. Estimation of Pentose Sugars and Pentosans as Furfurol.=—The\r\nproduction of furfurol by distilling carbohydrates with an acid has\r\nalready been mentioned. Tollens and his associates have shown that with\r\npentose sugars, and carbohydrate bodies yielding them, the production\r\nof furfurol is quantitive.\r\n\r\nThe production and estimation of furfurol have been systematically\r\nstudied by Krug, to whose paper the reader is referred for the complete\r\nliterature of the subject.[123] The essential principles of the\r\noperation are based on the conversion of the pentoses into furfurol by\r\ndistilling with a strong acid, and the subsequent precipitation and\r\nestimation of the furfurol formed in the first part of the reaction.\r\n\r\nThe best method of conducting the distillation is as follows:\r\n\r\nFive grams of the pentose substance are placed in a flask of about a\r\nquarter liter capacity, with 100 cubic centimeters of hydrochloric acid\r\nof 1.06 specific gravity. The arrangement of the apparatus is shown in\r\nFig. 46. The flame of the lamp is so regulated as to secure about two\r\ncubic centimeters of distillate per minute.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 46. DISTILLING APPARATUS FOR PENTOSES.]\r\n\r\nThe distillate is received in a graduated cylinder and as soon\r\nas thirty cubic centimeters are collected, an equal quantity of\r\nhydrochloric acid, of the strength noted, is added to the distilling\r\nflask, allowing it to flow in slowly so as not to stop the ebullition.\r\nThe process is continued until a drop of the distillate gives no\r\nsensible reaction for furfurol when tested with anilin acetate. The\r\ntest is applied as follows: Place a drop of the distillate on a piece\r\nof filter paper moistened with anilin acetate. The presence of furfurol\r\nwill be disclosed by the production of a brilliant red color. Usually\r\nabout three hours are consumed in the distillation, during which time a\r\nlittle less than 400 cubic centimeters of distillate is obtained. The\r\ndistillate is neutralized with solid sodium carbonate and, in order\r\nto have always the same quantity of common salt present, 10.2 grams\r\nof sodium chlorid are added for each fifty cubic centimeters of water\r\nnecessary to make the total volume to half a liter.[124]\r\n\r\nThe reactions with pentosans probably consist in first splitting up of\r\nthe molecule into a pentose and the subsequent conversion of the latter\r\ninto furfurol according to the following equations:\r\n\r\n        (C₅H₈O₄)ₙ + (H₂O)ₙ = (C₅H₁₀O₅)ₙ\r\n        Pentosan.   Water.  Pentose.\r\n\r\n    and\r\n\r\n        (C₅H₁₀O₅)ₙ = (C₅H₄O₂)ₙ + (3H₂O)ₙ.\r\n        Pentose.    Furfurol.   Water.\r\n\r\n=151. Determination of Furfurol.=—The quantity of furfurol obtained by\r\nthe process mentioned above may be determined in several ways.\r\n\r\n_As Furfuramid._—When ammonia is added to a saturated solution of\r\nfurfurol, furfuramid, (C₅H₄O)₃N₂, is formed. In order to secure the\r\nprecipitate it is necessary that the furfurol be highly concentrated\r\nand this can only be accomplished by a tedious fractional distillation.\r\nThis method, therefore, has little practical value.\r\n\r\n_As Furfurolhydrazone._—Furfurol is precipitated almost quantitively,\r\neven from dilute solutions, by phenylhydrazin. The reaction is\r\nrepresented by the equation:\r\n\r\n             C₆H₈N₂ + C₅H₄O₂  =  C₁₁H₁₀N₂O      +     H₂O.\r\n    Phenylhydrazin.  Furfurol. Furfurolhydrazone.   Water.\r\n\r\n=152. Volumetric Methods.=—Tollens and Günther have proposed\r\na volumetric method which is carried out as follows:[125] The\r\ndistillation is accomplished in the manner described. The distillate\r\nis placed in a large beaker, neutralized with sodium carbonate and\r\nacidified with a few drops of acetic. Phenylhydrazin solution of\r\nknown strength is run in until a drop of the liquid, after thorough\r\nmixing, shows no reaction for furfurol with anilin acetate. The\r\nreagent is prepared by dissolving five grams of pure phenylhydrazin and\r\nthree of glacial acetic acid in distilled water, and diluting to 100\r\ncubic centimeters. The solution is set by dissolving from two-tenths\r\nto three-tenths gram of pure furfurol in half a liter of water and\r\ntitrating with the phenylhydrazin as indicated above. The quantity of\r\nthe pentose used has a great influence on the result.\r\n\r\nWith nearly a gram of arabinose about fifty per cent of furfurol were\r\nobtained while when nearly five grams were used only about forty-six\r\nper cent of furfurol were found. With xylose a similar variation was\r\nfound, the percentage of furfurol, decreasing as the quantity of\r\npentose increased. The method, therefore, gives only approximately\r\naccurate results.\r\n\r\n=153. Method of Stone.=—Another volumetric method proposed by Stone\r\nis based on the detection of an excess of phenylhydrazin by its\r\nreducing action on the fehling reagent.[126] A standard solution of\r\nphenylhydrazin is prepared by dissolving one gram of the hydrochlorate\r\nand three grams of sodium acetate in water and completing the volume\r\nof the liquor to 100 cubic centimeters. This solution contains 1.494\r\nmilligrams of phenylhydrazin in each cubic centimeter, theoretically\r\nequivalent to 1.328 milligrams of furfurol. The reagent is set by\r\ntitrating against a known weight of furfurol. Pure furfurol may be\r\nprepared by treating the crude article with sulfuric acid and potassium\r\ndichromate, and subjecting the product to fractional distillation.\r\nThe distillate is treated with ammonia and the furfuramid formed is\r\npurified by recrystallizing from alcohol and drying over sulfuric acid.\r\nOne gram of this furfuramid is dissolved in dilute acetic acid and\r\nthe volume completed to one liter with water.[127] The phenylhydrazin\r\nsolution being unstable, is to be prepared at the time of use.\r\n\r\nThe titration is conducted as follows: Twenty-five cubic centimeters of\r\nthe distillate obtained from a pentose body, by the method described\r\nabove, are diluted with an equal volume of water, a certain quantity\r\nof the phenylhydrazin solution added to the mixture from a burette and\r\nthe whole heated quickly to boiling. The flask is rapidly cooled and a\r\nportion of its contents poured on a filter. The filtrate should have\r\na pale yellow color and be perfectly clear. If it become turbid on\r\nstanding, it should be refiltered. Two cubic centimeters of the clear\r\nfiltrate are boiled with double the quantity of the fehling reagent.\r\nIf phenylhydrazin be present, the color of the mixture will change\r\nfrom blue to green. By repeating the work, with varying quantities of\r\nphenylhydrazin, a point will soon be reached showing the end of the\r\nreaction in a manner entirely analogous to that observed in volumetric\r\nsugar analysis.\r\n\r\nIn practice the volumetric methods have given place to the more exact\r\ngravimetric methods described below.\r\n\r\n=154. Gravimetric Methods.=—The distillation is carried on and the\r\nvolume of the distillate completed to half a liter as described above.\r\nChalmot and Tollens then proceed as follows:[128] Ten cubic centimeters\r\nof a solution of phenylhydrazin acetate, containing in 100 cubic\r\ncentimeters twelve grams of the phenylhydrazin and seven and a half\r\ngrams of glacial acetic acid dissolved and filtered, are added to the\r\ndistillate and the mixture stirred with an appropriate mechanism for\r\nhalf an hour. The furfurolhydrazone at the end of this time will have\r\nseparated as small reddish-brown crystals. The mixture is then thrown\r\nonto an asbestos filter and the liquid separated with suction. The\r\nsuction should be very gradually applied so as not to clog the felt.\r\nThe precipitate adhering to the beaker is washed into the filter with\r\n100 cubic centimeters of water. The precipitate is dried at about 60°\r\nand weighed. As a check the hydrazone may be dissolved in hot alcohol,\r\nthe filter well washed, dried and again weighed. To obtain the weight\r\nof furfurol the weight of hydrazone found is multiplied by 0.516 and\r\n0.025 added to compensate for the amount which was held in solution\r\nor removed by washing. Less than one per cent of pentose can not be\r\ndetermined by this method since that amount is equalled by the known\r\nlosses during the manipulation.\r\n\r\n_Factor._—To convert the furfurol found into pentoses, the following\r\nfactors are used:\r\n\r\n    Per cent furfurol                                 Multiply for\r\n     obtained from      Multiply for   Multiply for   penta-glucoses\r\n     five grams of      arabinose by.   xylose by.    by.\r\n     pentoses.\r\n\r\n    2.5 per cent or less    1.90         1.70           1.67\r\n    5.0  ”   ”   ”  more    2.04         1.90           1.92\r\n\r\n=155. Method Of Krug.=—In conducting the determination of furfurol,\r\naccording to the method of Chalmont and Tollens just noticed, Krug\r\nobserved that the filtrate, after standing for some time, yielded a\r\nsecond precipitate of furfurol hydrazone. Great difficulty was also\r\nexperienced in collecting the precipitate upon the filter on account\r\nof the persistency with which it stuck to the sides of the vessel\r\nin which the precipitation took place.[129] In order to avoid these\r\ntwo objections, Krug modified the method as described below and this\r\nmodified method is now exclusively used in this laboratory.\r\n\r\nAfter the precipitation of the furfurol hydrazone, it is stirred\r\nvigorously, by means of an appropriate mechanical stirrer, for at\r\nleast half an hour and then allowed to rest for twenty-four hours. On\r\nfiltering after that length of time the filtrate remains perfectly\r\nclear and no further precipitation takes place. After the filtration is\r\ncomplete and the beaker and filtering tube well washed, no attempt is\r\nmade to detach the part of the filtrate adhering to the beaker but the\r\nwhole of the precipitate, both that upon the filter and that adhering\r\nto the sides of the beaker, is dissolved in strong alcohol, from thirty\r\nto forty cubic centimeters being used. The alcoholic solution is\r\ncollected in a small weighed flask, the alcohol evaporated at a gentle\r\nheat and the last traces of water removed by heating to 60° and blowing\r\na current of dry air through the flask. After weighing the precipitate\r\nof furfurol hydrazone, obtained as above, the calculation of the weight\r\nof pentose bodies is accomplished by means of the usual factors.\r\n\r\n=156. Precipitation of Furfurol with Pyrogalol.=—Furfurol is thrown\r\nout of solution in combination with certain phenol bodies by heating\r\ntogether in an acid solution. Hotter has proposed a method for the\r\ndetermination of furfurol based on the above fact.[130] The furfurol\r\nis obtained by distillation in the manner already described and\r\nhydrochloric acid is added if necessary to secure twelve per cent of\r\nthat body in a given volume. The furfurol is thrown out of an aliquot\r\nportion by heating with an excess of pyrogalol in closed tubes for\r\nabout two hours at 110°. The reaction takes place in two stages,\r\nrepresented by the following equations:\r\n\r\n        C₅H₄O₂  + C₆H₆O₃ = C₁₁H₁₀O₅\r\n\r\n    and\r\n\r\n        2C₁₁H₁₀O₅ = C₂₂H₁₈O₉ + H₂O.\r\n\r\nThe aliquot part of the distillate used should not contain more than\r\none-tenth of a gram of furfurol. The precipitate formed in this way is\r\ncollected on an asbestos felt, dried at 103° and weighed. The weight\r\nobtained divided by 1.974 gives the corresponding amount of furfurol.\r\nThere is some difficulty experienced in loosening the precipitate from\r\nthe sides of the tubes in which the heating takes place, but this\r\ndefect can be overcome by heating in covered beakers in an autoclave.\r\n\r\n=157. Precipitation with Phloroglucin.=—Instead of using pyrogalol for\r\nthe precipitating reagent phloroglucin may be employed. The method of\r\nprocedure proposed by Councler for this purpose is given below.[131]\r\nThe furfurol is prepared by distillation in the usual way. The volume\r\nof the distillate obtained is completed to half a liter with twelve per\r\ncent hydrochloric acid, and an aliquot portion, varying in volume with\r\nthe percentage of furfurol is withdrawn for precipitation. This portion\r\nis placed in a glass-stoppered flask with about twice the quantity of\r\nfinely powdered phloroglucin necessary to combine with the furfurol\r\npresent. The contents of the flask are well shaken and allowed to stand\r\nfifteen hours. The precipitate is collected on an asbestos filter,\r\nwashed free of chlorin, dried at the temperature of boiling water and\r\nweighed.\r\n\r\nThe theoretical quantity of precipitate corresponding to one part of\r\nfurfurol, _viz._, 2.22 parts, is never obtained since the precipitate\r\nis not wholly insoluble in water. The actual proportions between\r\nthe precipitate and the original furfurol vary with the amount of\r\nprecipitate obtained.\r\n\r\nWhen the weight of the precipitate is 200 milligrams and over, 2.12\r\nparts correspond to one part of furfurol. When the weight of the\r\nprecipitate varies from fifty to 100 milligrams, the ratio is as 2.05:1\r\nand when only about twenty-five milligrams of precipitate are obtained\r\nthe ratio is as 1.98:1.\r\n\r\nThe quantity of pentose bodies corresponding to the furfurol is\r\ncalculated from the factors given by Tollens in a preceding paragraph.\r\n\r\nThe reaction which takes place with furfurol and phloroglucin is simply\r\na condensation of the reagents with the separation of water. It is very\r\nnearly represented by the following formula:\r\n\r\n      2C₅H₄O₂ + C₆H₆O₃   =   C₁₆H₁₂O₆    +    H₂O.\r\n    Furfurol.  Phloroglucin  Condensation   Water.\r\n                              product.\r\n\r\nIt has been shown by Welbel and Zeisel,[132] that in the presence of\r\ntwelve per cent of hydrochloric acid phloroglucin itself is condensed\r\ninto dark insoluble compounds. When three molecules of furfurol and two\r\nmolecules of phloroglucin are present, the bodies are both condensed\r\nand separated by continued action. When from one and a quarter to three\r\nparts of phloroglucin by weight are used to one part of furfurol, the\r\nweight of the precipitate obtained under constant conditions may serve\r\nsufficiently well for the calculation of the furfurol. The precipitates\r\ncontain chlorin, which they give up even in the cold, to water. For\r\nthese reasons the analytical data obtained by the method of Councler,\r\ngiven above, are apt to be misleading. It is probable also that\r\nsimilar conditions may to a certain extent prevail in the separation\r\nof furfurol with phenylhydrazin, and further investigation in this\r\ndirection is desirable. For the present the very best method that can\r\nbe recommended for the estimation of pentoses and pentosans is the\r\nconversion thereof into furfurol and the separation of the compound\r\nwith phenylhydrazin acetate.\r\n\r\n=158. Estimation of Sugars by Fermentation.=—When a solution of\r\na hexose sugar is subjected to the action of certain ferments a\r\ndecomposition of the molecule takes place with the production of\r\ncarbon dioxid and various alcohols and organic acids. Under the action\r\nof the ferment of yeast _Saccharomyces cerevisiae_ the sugar yields\r\ntheoretically only carbon dioxid and ethyl alcohol, as represented by\r\nthe equation:\r\n\r\n    C₆H₁₂O₆ = 2C₂H₆O + 2CO₂.\r\n\r\nThe theoretical quantities of alcohol and carbon dioxid obtained\r\naccording to this equation are 51.11 percent of alcohol and 48.89 per\r\ncent of carbon dioxid.\r\n\r\nWhen the yeast ferment acts on cane sugar the latter first suffers\r\ninversion, and the molecules of dextrose and levulose produced are\r\nsubsequently converted into alcohol and carbon dioxid as represented\r\nbelow:\r\n\r\n    C₁₂H₂₂O₁₁ + H₂O = 2C₆H₁₂O₆\r\n\r\n    2C₆H₁₂O₆ = 4C₂H₆O + 4CO₂.\r\n\r\nCane sugar, plus the water of hydrolysis, will yield theoretically 53.8\r\nper cent of alcohol and 51.5 per cent of carbon dioxid.\r\n\r\nIn practice the theoretical proportions of alcohol and carbon dioxid\r\nare not obtained because of the difficulty of excluding other\r\nfermentative action, resulting in the formation especially of succinic\r\nacid and glycerol. Moreover, a part of the sugar is consumed by the\r\nyeast cells to secure their proper growth and development. In all\r\nonly about ninety-five per cent of the sugar can be safely assumed as\r\nentering into the production of alcohol. About 48.5 per cent of alcohol\r\nare all that may be expected of the weight of dextrose or invert sugar\r\nused. Only sugars containing three molecules of carbon or some multiple\r\nthereof are fermentable. Thus the trioses, hexoses, nonoses, etc., are\r\nsusceptible of fermentation, while the tetroses, pentoses, etc., are\r\nnot.\r\n\r\n=159. Estimating Alcohol.=—In the determination of sugar by\r\nfermentation, a rather dilute solution not exceeding ten per cent\r\nshould be used. A quantity of pure yeast, equivalent to four or five\r\nper cent of the sugar used, is added, and the contents of the vessel,\r\nafter being well shaken, exposed to a temperature of from 25° to 30°\r\nuntil the fermentation has ceased, which will be usually in from\r\ntwenty-four to thirty-six hours. The alcohol is then determined in the\r\nresidue by the methods given hereafter.\r\n\r\nThe weight of the alcohol obtained multiplied by 100 and divided by\r\n48.5, will give the weight of the hexose reducing sugar which has been\r\nfermented. Ninety-five parts of sucrose will give 100 parts of invert\r\nsugar.\r\n\r\n_Example._—Let the weight of alcohol obtained be 0.625 gram. Then 0.625\r\n× 100 ÷ 48.5 = 1.289 grams, the weight of the hexose, which has been\r\nfermented; 1.289 grams of dextrose or levulose correspond to 1.225 of\r\nsucrose.\r\n\r\n=160. Estimating Carbon Dioxid.=—The sugar may also be determined\r\nby estimating the amount of carbon dioxid produced during the\r\nfermentation. For this purpose the mixture of sugar solution and yeast,\r\nprepared as above mentioned, is placed in a flask whose stopper carries\r\ntwo tubes, one of which introduces air free of carbon dioxid into the\r\ncontents of the flask, and the other conducts the evolved carbon dioxid\r\ninto the absorption bulbs. In passing to the absorption bulbs the\r\ncarbon dioxid is freed of moisture by passing through another set of\r\nbulbs filled with strong sulfuric acid. During the fermentation, the\r\ncarbon dioxid is forced through the bulbs by the pressure produced, or\r\nbetter, a slow current of air is aspirated through the whole apparatus.\r\nThe aspiration is continued after the fermentation, has ceased, until\r\nall the carbon dioxid is expelled. Towards the end, the contents of\r\nthe flask may be heated to near the boiling-point. The increase of\r\nthe weight of the potash bulbs will give the weight of carbon dioxid\r\nobtained. A hexose reducing sugar will yield about 46.5 per cent of its\r\nweight of carbon dioxid. The calculation is made as suggested for the\r\nalcohol process.\r\n\r\nThe fermentation process has little practical value save in determining\r\nsucrose in presence of lactose, as will be described in another place.\r\n\r\n=161. Precipitation of Sugars in Combination with the Earthy\r\nBases.=—The sugars combine in varying proportions with the oxids\r\nand hydroxids of calcium, strontium and barium. Sucrose especially,\r\nfurnishes definite crystalline aggregates with these bases in such\r\na way as to form the groundwork of several technical processes in\r\nthe separation of that substance from its normally and abnormally\r\nassociated compounds. These processes have little use as analytical\r\nmethods, but are of great value, as mentioned, from a technical point\r\nof view.\r\n\r\n=162. Barium Saccharate.=—This compound is formed by mixing the aqueous\r\nsolutions of barium hydroxid and sugar. The saccharate separates\r\nin bright crystalline plates or needles from the warm solution,\r\nas C₁₂H₂₂O₁₁BaO. One part of this precipitate is soluble in about\r\nforty-five parts of water, both at 15° and 100°.\r\n\r\n=163. Strontium Saccharates.=—Both the mono- and distrontium\r\nsaccharates are known, _viz._, C₁₂H₂₂O₁₁SrO + 5H₂O and C₁₂H₂₂O₁₁2SrO.\r\n\r\nThe monosalt may be easily secured by adding a few of its crystals to a\r\nmixture of sugar and strontium hydroxid solutions.\r\n\r\nThe disaccharate is precipitated as a granular substance when from two\r\nto three molecules of strontium hydroxid are added to a boiling sugar\r\nsolution. The reaction is extensively used in separating the sugar from\r\nbeet molasses.\r\n\r\n=164. Calcium Saccharates.=—Three calcium saccharates are known in\r\nwhich one molecule of sugar is combined with one, two and three\r\nmolecules of lime respectively.\r\n\r\nThe monosaccharate is obtained by mixing the sugar and lime in the\r\nproper proportion and precipitating by adding alcohol.\r\n\r\nThe precipitate is partly granular and partly jelly-like, and is\r\nsoluble in cold water. The dicalcium compound is obtained in the same\r\nway and has similar properties. Both, on boiling, with water, form the\r\ntrisaccharate and free sugar.\r\n\r\nThe tricalcium saccharate is the most important of these compounds, and\r\nmay be obtained directly by mixing freshly burned and finely ground\r\nlime (CaO) with a very cold dilute solution of sugar.\r\n\r\nThe compound crystallizes with three or four molecules of water.\r\nWhen precipitated as described above, however, it has a granular,\r\nnearly amorphous structure, and the process is frequently used in the\r\nseparation of sugar from beet molasses.\r\n\r\nIn the laboratory but little success has been had in using even the\r\nbarium hydroxid as a chemical reagent, and therefore the reactions\r\nmentioned above are of little value for analytical purposes. In\r\nseparating sugar from vegetable fibers and seeds, however, the\r\ntreatment with strontium hydroxid is especially valuable the sugar\r\nbeing subsequently recovered in a free state by breaking up the\r\nsaccharate with carbon dioxid. The technical use of these reactions\r\nalso is of great importance in the beet sugar industry.\r\n\r\n=165. Qualitive Tests for the Different Sugars.=—The analyst will\r\noften be aided in examining an unknown substance by the application\r\nof qualitive tests, which will disclose to him the nature of the\r\nsaccharine bodies with which he has to deal.\r\n\r\n=166. Optical Test for Sucrose.=—The simplest test for the presence of\r\nsucrose is made with the polariscope. A small quantity of the sample\r\nunder examination is dissolved in water, clarified by any of the usual\r\nmethods, best with alumina cream, and polarized. A portion of the\r\nliquor is diluted with one-tenth its volume of strong hydrochloric acid\r\nand heated to just 68°, consuming about fifteen minutes time in the\r\noperation. The mixture is quickly cooled and again polarized in a tube\r\none-tenth longer than before used; or the same tube may be used and the\r\nobserved reading of the scale increased by one-tenth. If sucrose be\r\npresent the second reading will be much lower than the first, or may\r\neven be to the left.\r\n\r\n=167. Cobaltous Nitrate Test for Sucrose.=—Sucrose in solution may be\r\ndistinguished from other sugars by the amethyst violet color which it\r\nimparts to a solution of cobaltous nitrate. This reaction was first\r\ndescribed by Reich, in 1856, but has only lately been worked out in\r\ndetail. The test is applied as follows:\r\n\r\nTo about fifteen cubic centimeters of the sugar solution add five cubic\r\ncentimeters of a five per cent solution of cobaltous nitrate. After\r\nthoroughly mixing the two solutions, add two cubic centimeters of a\r\nfifty per cent solution of sodium hydroxid. Pure sucrose gives by this\r\ntreatment an amethyst violet color, which is permanent. Pure dextrose\r\ngives a turquoise blue color which soon passes into a light green. When\r\nthe two sugars are mixed the coloration produced by the sucrose is the\r\npredominant one, and one part of sucrose in nine parts of dextrose can\r\nbe distinguished. If the sucrose be mixed with impurities such as gum\r\narabic or dextrin, they should be precipitated by alcohol or basic lead\r\nacetate, before the application of the test. Dextrin may be thrown\r\nout by treatment of the solution with barium hydroxid and ammoniacal\r\nlead acetate. The reaction may also be applied to the detection of\r\ncane sugar in wines, after they are thoroughly decolorized by means of\r\nlead acetate and bone-black. The presence of added sucrose to milk,\r\neither in the fresh or condensed state, may also be detected after the\r\ndisturbing matters are thrown out with lead acetate. The presence of\r\nsucrose in honey may also be detected by this process. The reaction\r\nhas been tried in this laboratory with very satisfactory results. The\r\namethyst violet coloration with sucrose is practically permanent. On\r\nboiling the color is made slightly bluish, but is restored to the\r\noriginal tint on cooling. Dextrose gives at first a fine blue color\r\nwhich in the course of two hours passes into a pale green. A slight\r\nflocculent precipitate is noticed in the tube containing the dextrose.\r\nMaltose and lactose act very much as dextrose, but in the end do not\r\ngive so fine a green color. If the solutions containing dextrose,\r\nlactose and maltose be boiled, the original color is destroyed and a\r\nyellow-green color takes its place. The reaction is one which promises\r\nto be of considerable practical value to analysts, as it may be applied\r\nfor the qualitive detection of sucrose in seeds and other vegetable\r\nproducts.[133]\r\n\r\n=168. The Dextrose Group.=—In case the carbohydrate in question shows a\r\nright-handed rotation and the absence of sucrose is established by the\r\npolariscopic observation described above, the presence of the dextrose\r\ngroup may be determined by the following test.[134]\r\n\r\nFive grams of the carbohydrate are oxidized by boiling with from twenty\r\nto thirty cubic centimeters of nitric acid of 1.15 specific gravity,\r\nand then at gentle heat evaporated to dryness with stirring. If much\r\nmucic acid be present, as will be the case if the original matter\r\ncontained lactose some water is added and the mixture well stirred,\r\nand again evaporated to dryness to expel all nitric acid. The residue\r\nshould be of a brown color. The mass is again mixed with a little\r\nwater and the acid reaction neutralized by rubbing with fine-ground\r\npotassium carbonate. The carbonate should be added in slight excess and\r\nacetic acid added to the alkaline mixture, which is concentrated by\r\nevaporation and allowed to stand a few days. At the end of this time\r\npotassium saccharate has formed and is separated from the mother liquid\r\nby pouring on a porous porcelain plate. The residue is collected,\r\ndissolved in a little water and again allowed to crystallize, when it\r\nis collected on a porous plate, as before, and washed by means of an\r\natomizer with a little aqueous spray until it is pure white and free of\r\nany oxalic acid. The residual acid potassium saccharate may be weighed\r\nafter drying and then converted into the silver salt. The potash salt\r\nfor this purpose is dissolved in water, neutralized with ammonia and\r\nprecipitated with a solution of silver nitrate. The precipitate is\r\nwell stirred, collected on a gooch and washed and dried in a dark\r\nplace. It contains 50.94 percent of silver. All sugars which contain\r\nthe dextrose group yield silver saccharate when treated as above\r\ndescribed. Inulin, sorbose, arabinose and galactose yield no saccharic\r\nacid under this treatment, and thus it is shown that they contain\r\nno dextrose group. Milk sugar, maltose, the dextrins, raffinose and\r\nsucrose yield saccharic acid when treated as above and therefore all\r\ncontain the dextrose group.\r\n\r\n=169. Levulose.=—The levulose group of sugars, wherever it occurs, when\r\noxidized with nitric acid, gives rise to tartaric, racemic, glycolic\r\nand oxalic acids, which are not characteristic, being produced also\r\nby the oxidation of other carbohydrates. A more distinguishing test\r\nis afforded by the color reactions produced with resorcin.[135] The\r\nreagent is prepared by dissolving half a gram of resorcin in thirty\r\ncubic centimeters each of water and strong hydrochloric acid. To the\r\nsugar solution under examination an equal volume of strong hydrochloric\r\nacid is added, and then a few drops of the reagent. The mixture is\r\ngently warmed, and in the presence of levulose develops a fire-red\r\ncolor. Dextrose, lactose, mannose and the pentoses do not give the\r\ncoloration, but it is produced by sorbose in a striking degree, and\r\nalso by sucrose and raffinose since these sugars contain the levulose\r\ngroup.\r\n\r\n=170. Galactose.=—The galactose which arises from the hydrolysis of\r\nmilk sugar is readily recognized by the mucic acid which it gives on\r\noxidation with nitric acid.[136] The analytical work is conducted\r\nas follows: The body containing galactose or galactan is placed in\r\na beaker with about sixty cubic centimeters of nitric acid of 1.15\r\nspecific gravity for each five grams of the sample used. The beaker\r\nis placed on a steam-bath and heated, with frequent stirring, until\r\ntwo-thirds of the nitric acid have been evaporated. The residual\r\nmixture is allowed to stand over night and the following morning is\r\ntreated with ten cubic centimeters of water, allowed to stand for\r\ntwenty-four hours, filtered through a gooch, and the collected matter\r\nwashed with twenty-five cubic centimeters of water, dried at 100° and\r\nweighed. The mucic acid collected in this way will amount to about\r\nthirty-seven per cent of the milk sugar or seventy-five per cent of the\r\ngalactose oxidized. Raffinose yields under similar treatment, about\r\ntwenty-three per cent of mucic acid, which proves that the galactose\r\ngroup is contained in that sugar. Raffinose, therefore, is composed of\r\none molecule each of dextrose, levulose, and galactose.\r\n\r\n=171. Invert Sugar.=—The presence of a trace of invert sugar\r\naccompanying sucrose can be determined by Soldaini’s solution,\r\nparagraph =124=, or by boiling with methyl blue.[137] Methyl blue is\r\nthe hydrochlorate of an ammonium base, which, under the influence of\r\na reducing agent, loses two atoms of hydrogen and becomes a colorless\r\ncompound. The test for invert sugar is made as follows: The reagent\r\nis prepared by dissolving one gram of methyl blue in water. If the\r\nsugar solution is not clear, twenty grams of the sugar are dissolved\r\nin water clarified by lead subacetate, the volume completed to 100\r\ncubic centimeters, and the solid matters separated by filtration. The\r\nfiltrate is made slightly alkaline with sodium carbonate to remove the\r\nlead. A few drops of soda lye solution are then added and the mixture\r\nthrown on a filter. To twenty-five cubic centimeters of the filtrate a\r\ndrop of the methyl blue solution is added, and a portion of the liquor\r\nheated in a test tube over the naked flame. If, after boiling for one\r\nminute, the coloration disappear, the sample contains at least 0.01\r\nper cent of invert sugar; if the solution remain blue it contains none\r\nat all or less than 0.01 per cent. The test may also be made with the\r\ndilute copper carbonate solution of Ost described further on.\r\n\r\n=172. Compounds with Phenylhydrazin.=—Many sugars may also be\r\nqualitively distinguished by the character of their compounds with\r\nphenylhydrazin. In general, it may be said that those sugars which\r\nreduce fehling solution form definite crystalline compounds with the\r\nreagent named. If a moderately dilute hot solution of a reducing sugar\r\nbe brought into contact with phenylhydrazin acetate, a crystalline\r\nosazone is separated. The reaction takes place between one molecule of\r\nthe sugar and two molecules of the hydrazin compound, according to the\r\nfollowing formula:\r\n\r\n    C₆H₁₂O₆ + 2C₆H₅N₂H₃ = C₁₈H₂₂N₄O₄ + 2H₂O + H₂.\r\n\r\nThe hydrogen does not escape but combines in the nascent state with the\r\nexcess of phenylhydrazin to form anilin and ammonia.\r\n\r\nThe precipitation is accomplished as follows:\r\n\r\nOne part by weight of the sugar, two parts of phenylhydrazin\r\nhydrochlorate, and three parts of sodium acetate are dissolved in\r\ntwenty parts of water and gradually heated on the water-bath.\r\n\r\nThe osazone slowly separates in a crystalline form and it is freed from\r\nthe mother liquor by filtration, and purified by solution in alcohol\r\nand recrystallization. The crystals are composed of yellow needles,\r\nwhich are difficultly soluble in water and more easily in hot alcohol.\r\nThe crystals are not decomposed by a dilute acid but are destroyed by\r\nthe action of strong acids.\r\n\r\n_Dextrosazone._—The crystals melt at from 204° to 205°, reduce fehling\r\nliquor, and dissolved in glacial acetic acid are slightly left rotating.\r\n\r\n_Levulosazone._—This body has the same properties as the dextrose\r\ncompound.\r\n\r\n_Maltosazone._—This substance melts at 206° with decomposition. It is\r\nleft rotating. Its structure is represented by the formula C₂₄H₃₂N₄O₉.\r\n\r\n_Galactosazone._—This substance, C₁₈H₂₂N₄O₄, has the same centesimal\r\ncomposition as the corresponding bodies produced from dextrose and\r\nlevulose. It is distinguished from these compounds, however, by its low\r\nmelting point, _viz._, 193°.\r\n\r\nThe above comprise all the phenylosazones which are important from\r\nthe present point of view. Sucrose, by inversion, furnishes a mixture\r\nof dextros- and levulosazones when treated with phenylhydrazin, while\r\nstarch and dextrin yield the dextros- or maltosazone when hydrolyzed.\r\nLactose yields a mixture of dextros- and galactosazones when hydrolyzed\r\nand treated as above described.\r\n\r\nThe reactions with phenylhydrazin are approximately quantitive and it\r\nis possible that methods of exact determination may be based on them in\r\nthe near future.[138]\r\n\r\n=173. Other Qualitive Tests for Sugars.=—The analyst may sometimes\r\ndesire a more extended test of qualitive reactions than those given\r\nabove. The changes of color noticed on heating with alkalies may\r\noften be of advantage in discriminating between different sugars. The\r\nformation of definite compounds with the earthy and other mineral bases\r\nmay also be used for qualitive determinations. One of the most delicate\r\nqualitive tests is found in the production of furfurol and this will be\r\ndescribed in the following paragraphs.\r\n\r\n=174. Detection of Sugars and Other Carbohydrates by Means of\r\nFurfurol.=—The production of furfurol (furfuraldehyd) as noted in\r\nparagraph =150=, is also used quantitively for the determination of\r\npentose sugars and pentosans.\r\n\r\nFurfurol was first obtained from bran (_furfur_), whence its name,\r\nby treating this substance with sulfuric acid, diluted with three\r\nvolumes of water, and subjecting the mixture to distillation. Its\r\npercentage composition is represented by the symbol C₅H₄O₂, and its\r\ncharacteristics as an aldehyd by the molecular structure C₄H₃O,C-HO.\r\n\r\nCarbohydrates in general, when treated as described above for bran,\r\nyield furfurol, but only in a moderate quantity, with the exception of\r\nthe pentoses.\r\n\r\nMylius has shown[139] that Pettenkofer’s reaction for choleic acid is\r\ndue to the furfurol arising from the cane sugar employed, which, with\r\nthe gall acid, produces the beautiful red-blue colors characteristic of\r\nthe reaction.\r\n\r\nVon Udránszky[140] describes methods for detecting traces of\r\ncarbohydrates by the furfurol reaction, which admit of extreme\r\ndelicacy. The solution of furfurol in water, at first proposed by\r\nMylius, is to be used and it should not contain more than two and\r\ntwo-tenths per cent, while a solution containing five-tenths per cent\r\nfurfurol is found to be most convenient. The furfurol, before using,\r\nshould be purified by distillation, and, as a rule, only a single drop\r\nof the solution used for the color reaction.\r\n\r\nThe furfurol reaction proposed by Schiff[141] appears to be well suited\r\nfor the detection of carbohydrates. It is made as follows:\r\n\r\nXylidin is mixed with an equal volume of glacial acetic acid and the\r\nsolution treated with some alcohol. Strips of filter paper are then\r\ndipped in the solution and dried. When these strips of prepared paper\r\nare brought in contact with the most minute portion of furfurol,\r\nfuroxylidin is formed, C₄H₃OCH(C₈H₈NH₂)₂, producing a beautiful red\r\ncolor. In practice, a small portion of the substance, supposed to\r\ncontain a carbohydrate, is placed in a test tube and heated with a\r\nslight excess of concentrated sulfuric acid. The prepared paper is then\r\nplaced over the mouth of the test tube so as to be brought into contact\r\nwith the escaping vapors of furfurol.\r\n\r\nThe furfurol reaction with α-naphthol for some purposes, especially\r\nthe detection of sugar in urine, is more delicate than the one just\r\ndescribed. This reaction was first described by Molisch[142], who,\r\nhowever, did not understand its real nature.\r\n\r\nThe process is carried on as follows: The dilute solution should\r\ncontain not to exceed from 0.05 to one-tenth per cent of carbohydrates.\r\nIf stronger, it should be diluted. Place one drop of the liquid in a\r\ntest tube with two drops of fifteen per cent alcoholic solution of\r\nα-naphthol, add carefully one-half cubic centimeter of concentrated\r\nsulfuric acid, allowing it to flow under the mixture. The appearance\r\nof a violet ring over a greenish fringe indicates the presence of a\r\ncarbohydrate. If the substance under examination contain more than a\r\ntrace of nitrogenous matter, this must be removed before the tests\r\nabove described are applied.\r\n\r\nIf the liquids be mixed by shaking when the violet ring is seen, a\r\ncarmine tint with a trace of blue is produced. If this be examined with\r\na spectroscope, a small absorption band will be found between D and E,\r\nand from F outward the whole spectrum will be observed. One drop of\r\ndextrose solution containing 0.05 per cent of sugar gives a distinct\r\nreaction by this process. It can be used, therefore, to detect the\r\npresence of as little as 0.028 milligram of grape sugar. This test has\r\nbeen found exceedingly delicate in this laboratory, and sufficiently\r\nsatisfactory without the spectroscopic adjunct.\r\n\r\nThe furfurol reaction is useful in detecting the presence of minute\r\ntraces of carbohydrates but is of little value in discriminating\r\nbetween the different classes of these bodies.\r\n\r\nIt is not practical here to go into greater detail in the description\r\nof qualitive reactions. The analyst, desiring further information,\r\nshould consult the standard works on sugar chemistry.[143]\r\n\r\n=175. Detection of Sugars by Bacterial Action.=—Many forms of bacteria\r\nmanifest a selective action towards sugars and this property may in the\r\nfuture become the basis of a qualitive and even quantitive test for\r\nsugars and other carbohydrates. Our present knowledge of the subject\r\nis due almost exclusively to the researches of Smith, conducted at the\r\nDepartment of Agriculture.[144] Dextrose is the sugar first and most\r\nvigorously attacked by bacterial action, and by proper precautions the\r\nwhole of the dextrose may be removed from mixtures with sucrose and\r\nlactose.\r\n\r\nThe development of other forms of micro-organisms which will have the\r\nfaculty of attacking other and special forms of carbohydrates is to be\r\nlooked for with confident assurance of success.\r\n\r\n\r\nDETERMINATION OF STARCH.\r\n\r\n=176. Constitution of Starch.=—The molecule of starch is without doubt\r\nformed by the condensation of a large number of hexose bodies. On\r\naccount of its great insolubility its molecular weight has not been\r\ndetermined with any degree of accuracy. Its formula may be expressed\r\neither as (C₆H₁₀O₅)ₙ or (C₁₂H₂₀O₁₀)ₙ. It is insoluble in cold water and\r\nother common solvents and does not pass into solution in any reagent\r\nwithout undergoing a change of structure. In hot water it forms a paste\r\nand when heated under pressure with water it undergoes a partial change\r\nand becomes soluble. Heated with acids or subjected to the action of\r\ncertain ferments it suffers hydrolysis and is transformed into dextrin,\r\nmaltose and dextrose. In analytical work an attempt is usually made to\r\ntransform the starch entirely into dextrose, the quantity of which is\r\nthen determined by some of the processes already given. All starches\r\npossess the property of giving an intensely blue color with iodin and\r\nthis reaction serves to detect the most minute quantity of the material.\r\n\r\nStarch grains derived from different sources are distinguished by\r\ndifferences in size and appearance. In most cases a careful examination\r\nof the starch particles will reveal their origin.[145] The greatest\r\npart of the cereal grains is composed of starch, the percentage ranging\r\nfrom sixty to eighty. Rice has the greatest percentage of starch in\r\nits composition of any substance. Certain root crops are also rich\r\nin starch, such as the potato, artichoke and cassava. Starch appears\r\nas one of the first products of vegetable metabolism, according to\r\nsome authorities, preceding the formation of sugars. By reason of its\r\ngreater complexity, however, it is more probable that the production\r\nof simple sugars precedes the formation of the more complex molecule.\r\nStarch granules are probably used as a food by the plant in the\r\nbuilding of more complex structures and the excess of this food is\r\nstored in the seeds and in tubers.\r\n\r\n=177. Separation of Starch Particles.=—Advantage is taken of the\r\ninsolubility of the starch particles to secure their separation from\r\nthe other vegetable structures with which they are associated. The\r\nsubstances containing starch are reduced to a pulp as fine as possible,\r\nand this pulp being placed in a fine cloth the starch particles are\r\nwashed through the cloth with water. The milky filtrate carrying the\r\nstarch is collected in an appropriate holder and, after some time, the\r\nparticles subside. They may then be collected and dried. While this\r\nprocess is the one used commercially in the manufacture of starch, it\r\ncan only give approximate data respecting the actual quantity of starch\r\nin a given weight of the sample. It is not quite possible by this\r\nmethod to get all the starch separated from the rest of the vegetable\r\nmatter, and particles of foreign substances, such as cellulose and\r\nalbuminoid matters, may pass through the filter cloth and be found\r\nwith the deposited granules. It follows from this that the quantitive\r\ndetermination of the starch in a given sample by any direct method is\r\nonly approximately exact.\r\n\r\n=178. Methods of Separation.=—Hot acids cannot be safely employed\r\nto dissolve starch from its natural concomitants because other\r\ncarbohydrate bodies become soluble under similar conditions. In such\r\ncases the natural sugars which are present should be removed by cold\r\nwater and the starch dissolved from the residue by a diastatic ferment.\r\nInstead of this the sugars may be determined in a separate portion\r\nof the pulped material and the starch, together with the sugars,\r\ndetermined, and the quantity of sugar found deducted from the final\r\nresult.\r\n\r\nIn these cases the final determinations are made on the sugars, after\r\ninverting the sucrose, and proceeding as directed for invert sugars\r\nin paragraph =141=. The starch, after separation with diastase, is\r\nconverted into dextrose by one of the methods to be given and the\r\nresulting dextrose determined by one of the approved methods.\r\n\r\n=179. Separation with Diastase.=—Diastase or malt extract at a\r\ntemperature of about 65° rapidly renders starch soluble. Cereals,\r\npotato meal and other starch-holding bodies are dried, first at a low\r\ntemperature, and extracted with ether or petroleum to remove fat. The\r\nmaterial is then rubbed up with water, boiled, cooled to 65°, and\r\ntreated with malt extract (diastase) prepared as given below. One\r\nkilogram of ground green malt is mixed with one liter of glycerol\r\nand an equal quantity of water, and allowed to stand, with frequent\r\nshaking, for eight days. After that time the mixture is filtered,\r\nfirst through a small filter press and afterwards through paper. In\r\ncase no filter press is at hand the mixture may be pressed in a bag\r\nand the liquor obtained, filtered. Malt extract obtained in this way\r\nwill keep its diastatic properties for a long time. In its use, blank\r\ndeterminations must be made of the dextrose produced by treating equal\r\nportions of it with hydrochloric acid. For three grams of starchy\r\nmaterial twenty-five cubic centimeters of the malt solution should be\r\nused and the mixture kept at 65° for two hours.[146]\r\n\r\n=180. Method in Use at the Halle Station.=—The method of separating\r\nstarch from cereals, potatoes and other starch-holding materials,\r\nemployed at the Halle station, is essentially the same as already\r\ndescribed.[147]\r\n\r\nThe malt extract used is prepared immediately beforehand, inasmuch\r\nas no preservative is added to it. It can be quickly prepared by\r\ndigesting, for a short time at not above 50°, 100 grams of finely\r\nground dried malt with one liter of water and separating the extract by\r\nfiltration. This extract will keep only a few hours.\r\n\r\nThe material in which the starch is to be determined is dried and\r\nextracted with ether. From two to four grams of the extracted\r\nmaterial, according to the amount of starch which it contains, are\r\nboiled for half an hour with 100 cubic centimeters of water, cooled to\r\n65°, treated with ten cubic centimeters of malt extract and kept at\r\nthe temperature named for half an hour. It is then again boiled for\r\nfifteen minutes, cooled to the temperature mentioned and again treated\r\nwith malt extract as above. Two treatments with malt extract are\r\nusually sufficient to bring all the starch into solution. Finally it\r\nis again boiled and the volume completed to 250 cubic centimeters and\r\nthrown upon a filter. Two hundred cubic centimeters of the filtrate are\r\nconverted into dextrose by boiling with hydrochloric acid, and the rest\r\nof the analysis is conducted in the usual manner. The dextrose value of\r\nthe quantity of malt extract used must be determined upon a separate\r\nportion thereof, and the quantity of dextrose found deducted from the\r\ntotal amount obtained in the analysis.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 47. AUTOCLAVE FOR STARCH ANALYSIS.]\r\n\r\n=181. Separation by Hydrolysis with Water at High\r\nTemperatures.=—Instead of dissolving the starch with diastase, it may\r\nbe brought into solution by heating with water under pressure. The\r\nformer method employed of heating in sealed flasks has been entirely\r\nsuperceded by heating in an autoclave. The materials are best held in\r\nmetal beakers furnished with a cover which prevents loss from boiling\r\nif the pressure should be removed too rapidly after the completion\r\nof the operation. The autoclave is a strong metal vessel capable of\r\nresisting the pressure of several atmospheres. It is furnished with a\r\npressure gauge C and a safety valve D, as shown in the figure. The top\r\nis securely screwed on by means of a wrench, shown at the right hand\r\nside. In the figure a portion of the case is represented cut away to\r\nshow the arrangement of the metal beakers inside.\r\n\r\nIn the method of Reinke, as practiced at the Halle station, and in\r\nthis laboratory, about three grams of the starchy substance are placed\r\nin each of the metal beakers with twenty-five cubic centimeters of\r\na one per cent lactic acid solution and thirty cubic centimeters of\r\nwater. The contents of the beaker are thoroughly mixed and they are\r\nthen heated for two and a half hours in the autoclave, at a pressure\r\nof three and a half atmospheres. The addition of the lactic acid is\r\nfor the purpose of protecting any sugar which may be present from\r\ndecomposition at the high pressure and temperature employed. After\r\nthe completion of the heating, the autoclave is allowed to cool, the\r\ncover is removed and the beakers taken out and their contents washed\r\nwith hot water into quarter liter flasks. After cooling, the volume\r\nis completed with cold water, and after standing for half an hour,\r\nwith frequent shaking, the contents of the flasks are filtered and\r\n200 cubic centimeters of the filtrate in each case converted into\r\ndextrose with hydrochloric acid in the usual way. In order to obtain\r\nagreeing results, it is highly necessary that the substance before\r\ntreatment should be ground to a fine powder. The addition of the lactic\r\nacid, as practiced in the reinke method, tends to give somewhat high\r\nresults, due probably to the hydrolytic action of the acid on the\r\nfiber present. When starchy bodies are heated in the autoclave for the\r\ndetermination of their starch by polarimetric methods, or for ordinary\r\ndeterminations, the use of lactic acid should be omitted.\r\n\r\n_Example._—The following data indicate the methods of calculation to\r\nbe followed in the determination of the percentage of starch in the\r\nmaterial by diastatic hydrolysis: Three grams of a barley were inverted\r\nby diastase, as directed above, the volume of the solution made a\r\nquarter of a liter, filtered, 200 cubic centimeters of the filtrate\r\nconverted into dextrose by hydrochloric acid, the volume completed to\r\nhalf a liter with water and fifty cubic centimeters thereof oxidized\r\nby the alkaline copper solution in the usual way. The amount of copper\r\nobtained was 331 milligrams, corresponding to 174 milligrams of\r\ndextrose. The amount of malt extract used in hydrolyzing the barley\r\nmentioned above, was ten cubic centimeters. The diastatic solution\r\ninverted with hydrochloric acid and treated as indicated above, yielded\r\n191 milligrams of copper, corresponding to ninety-eight milligrams of\r\ndextrose in ten cubic centimeters of the malt extract. The quantity of\r\nmalt extract represented in the final determination of copper, however,\r\nwas only one and six-tenths cubic centimeters. We then have:\r\n\r\n    Total dextrose                                    174 milligrams\r\n    Dextrose in one and six-tenths cubic centimeters\r\n         malt extract                                  16 milligrams\r\n    Dextrose corresponding to 240 milligrams of\r\n         barley                                       158 milligrams\r\n\r\nCalculated on the proportion that dextrose is to starch, as ten is to\r\nnine, this is equivalent to 142 milligrams of starch. The percentage\r\nof starch in the original substance, therefore, was equivalent to 142\r\nmultiplied by 100, divided by 240, _viz._, 59.17.\r\n\r\n=182. Principles of the Methods of Determination.=—In the approximately\r\npure state in which starch exists in the trade, it may be determined\r\nby conversion into dextrose and estimating the latter by one of the\r\nmethods given. It is probable that there is no known method by which\r\nstarch can be entirely converted into dextrose, and all the methods of\r\nhydrolysis, when used for quantitive purposes, must be standardized,\r\nnot by the theoretical quantity of dextrose which a given weight of\r\npure starch should yield, but by the actual quantity obtained. Starch\r\nis not largely converted into dextrose by any of the diastatic ferments\r\nwhich produce principally maltose and dextrins. Recourse must therefore\r\nbe had to strong acids. In practice, hydrochloric is the one usually\r\nemployed. By the action of a hot mineral acid, not only is starch\r\nconverted into dextrose, but also the dextrose found is subjected to\r\nchanges. In such cases an opposing action seems to be exerted by the\r\nhydrolytic agent, a part of the dextrose formed suffering a partial\r\ncondensation, and thus assuming a state of higher molecular weight,\r\napproaching the constitution of the dextrins. Another part of the\r\ndextrose may also suffer oxidation and thus disappear entirely in\r\nrespect of the further steps in starch analysis.\r\n\r\nIn such cases, the best the analyst can do is to conduct the hydrolysis\r\nin as nearly as possible constant conditions, and to assume that the\r\npercentage of dextrose present at a given time bears a constant ratio\r\nto the quantity of starch hydrolyzed. In reality almost all the starch\r\nappears finally as dextrose, and by proceeding on the assumption noted\r\nabove a fairly satisfactory accounting may be made of the remainder.\r\n\r\nStarch being insoluble, it cannot be determined directly by its\r\nrotatory power. When heated for a few hours in contact with water at a\r\nhigh pressure, starch becomes soluble, and in this state has a fairly\r\nconstant gyrodynat, _viz._, [_a_]_{D} = 197°.\r\n\r\nStarch is also rendered soluble by rubbing it in a mortar for about ten\r\nminutes with an excess of strong hydrochloric acid, and in this way\r\na quick approximate idea may be obtained of the percentage present.\r\nStarch prepared in this manner, however, has a strong reducing power on\r\nmetallic salts, showing that a part of it has already, even in so short\r\na time, assumed the state of maltose or dextrose. The gyrodynat of\r\npure anhydrous starch in such conditions varies from [_a_]_{D} = 197°\r\nto [_a_]_{D} = 194°. Starch is also rendered soluble by boiling with\r\nsalicylic acid, whereby a solution is obtained having a gyrodynat of\r\n[_a_]_{D} = 200°(circa). The methods of procedure for the analysis of\r\nstarch will be set forth in detail in the following paragraphs.\r\n\r\n=183. Estimation of Water.=—In prepared or commercial starches the\r\nwater may be determined by heating in a partial vacuum. The temperature\r\nat first should be low, not exceeding 60°. After drying for an hour\r\nat that heat the temperature may be gradually increased. The last\r\ntraces of water come off from starch with difficulty, and the final\r\ntemperature may be carried a little beyond 100° without danger of\r\ndecomposition.\r\n\r\nOst recommends the use of an atmosphere of hydrogen or illuminating\r\ngas.[148] One and a half grams of the finely powdered sample are\r\nplaced in the drying tube described in paragraph =23=, and heated in\r\na stream of dry hydrogen. The temperature at first is kept at about\r\n60° for several hours and is then gradually increased to 120°. Ost\r\nstates that even at 150° the sample preserves its pure white color,\r\nbut so high a temperature is not necessary. Maercker, at the Halle\r\nstation, makes use of the same process, but employs illuminating gas\r\ninstead of hydrogen. The importance of beginning the desiccation at\r\na low temperature arises from the fact that at a higher temperature,\r\nbefore the greater part of the water is driven off, the starch will\r\nsuffer a partial fusion and form a paste which is very difficult to\r\ndry. The dried sample must be kept in a stoppered vessel to prevent the\r\nabsorption of hygroscopic moisture.\r\n\r\n=184. Estimation of Ash.=—When the drying is accomplished in a flat\r\nplatinum dish, the same sample may serve for incineration. Otherwise\r\nthe incineration may be accomplished in another portion of the sample\r\nby following directions already given.[149]\r\n\r\n=185. Nitrogen.=—Even very pure samples of starch may contain a little\r\nnitrogen which is most conveniently determined by moist combustion.[150]\r\n\r\nAs a rule, in commercial starches of good quality, the quantity of pure\r\nstarch may be considered to be the remainder after subtracting the sum\r\nof the weights of water, ash and nitrogen multiplied by 6.25, from the\r\noriginal weight of the sample taken.\r\n\r\n    _Example_:—\r\n\r\n        Per cent of moisture found          12.85\r\n         ”   ”   ”  ash found                0.08\r\n         ”   ”   ”  nitrogen × 6.25          0.27\r\n                                          -----\r\n              Sum                           13.20\r\n        Per cent of pure starch in sample   86.80\r\n\r\nSamples of starch usually contain also traces of fat and fiber, and\r\nthese when present in weighable quantities, should be determined and\r\nproper deductions made.\r\n\r\n=186. Hydrolysis with Acids.=—The acids commonly chosen for hydrolyzing\r\nstarch are sulfuric and hydrochloric. The former has the advantage of\r\nbeing more easily removed from the finished product but the latter\r\nperforms the work with less damage to the sugars formed. For commercial\r\npurposes sulfuric and for analytical practice hydrochloric acids are\r\ncommonly employed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 47 (BIS). MAERCKER’S HYDROLYZING APPARATUS FOR\r\nSTARCH.]\r\n\r\nThe best process for analytical purposes is the one proposed by\r\nSachsse.[151] In this method the starch is heated with the hydrolyzing\r\nmixture in the proportion of three grams to 200 cubic centimeters\r\nof water and twenty of hydrochloric acid of 1.125 specific gravity,\r\ncontaining five and six-tenths grams of the pure gas. The heating is\r\ncontinued for three hours on a steam-bath. Maercker recommends, instead\r\nof the above procedure, heating for two hours at gentle ebullition in\r\nan oil-bath. In this method three grams of the starch are reduced to\r\npaste with 200 cubic centimeters of water, and then boiled for two\r\nhours with fifteen cubic centimeters of hydrochloric acid of 1.125\r\nspecific gravity. The erlenmeyers in which the hydrolysis takes place\r\nare heated in an oil-bath and are provided with reflux condensers made\r\nof long glass tubes on which some bulbs have been blown, as shown in\r\nthe accompanying figure. In all cases after hydrolysis the solution\r\nis neutralized, made to a standard volume and an aliquot part, after\r\nfiltration, diluted to contain an amount of dextrose suited to the use\r\nof the table by Allihn for calculating the percentage of sugar. In\r\ndiluting the solution preparatory to the estimation of dextrose, it is\r\nwell to remember that nine parts of starch will furnish theoretically\r\nten parts of dextrose. Since three grams of the sample are used,\r\ncontaining approximately eighty-five per cent of starch, the quantity\r\nof dextrose present is a little less than three grams. The solution\r\nshould therefore contain not less than 300 cubic centimeters.\r\n\r\n=187. Factor for Calculating Starch from the Dextrose Obtained.=—If all\r\nthe starch could be converted into dextrose without loss, the quantity\r\nof it could be easily calculated theoretically on the supposition that\r\nthe formula of starch is (C₆H₁₀O₅)ₙ. The factor by this assumption is,\r\nstarch = dextrose × 0.90. If the starch have the formula assigned to it\r\nby Nägeli, _viz._, C₃₆H₆₂O₃₁ the formula becomes, starch = dextrose ×\r\n0.918.\r\n\r\nOst prefers to work by Sachsse’s method and to use the factor 0.925 to\r\nconvert the dextrose into starch.[152]\r\n\r\nIn view of all the facts in the case it appears that the analyst will\r\nreach nearly correct results by converting the starch into dextrose\r\nby heating for three hours at 100° with hydrochloric acid or for two\r\nhours at gentle ebullition as directed above, determining the resultant\r\ndextrose and multiplying the weight thereof by 0.92.\r\n\r\n=188. Polarization of Starch.=—Starch may be prepared for polarization\r\nby dissolving it in cold hydrochloric acid. The process as carried\r\nout by Effront is as follows.[153] Five grams of starch are rubbed\r\nwith twenty cubic centimeters of cold concentrated hydrochloric\r\nacid for nearly ten minutes or until the solution is quite clear.\r\nThe volume is completed to 200 cubic centimeters with water and the\r\nsolution polarized. By this process there is always produced a notable\r\nquantity of reducing sugars, and for this reason it must be admitted\r\nthat a portion of the starch has suffered complete hydrolysis. Ost\r\ntherefore recommends the use of an acid of 1.17 specific gravity,\r\nand the gyrodynat of the soluble starch thus produced is found to\r\nvary from [_a_]_{D} = 196°.3 to 196°.7. When acid of 1.20 specific\r\ngravity is employed the gyrodynat falls to [_a_]_{D} = 194.2.[154] For\r\napproximately correct work the solution with the weaker hydrochloric\r\nacid and subsequent polarization is to be recommended as the most rapid\r\nmethod for starch determination.\r\n\r\nIt will be of interest to add the observation that the gyrodynat of\r\nmaltose has lately been redetermined by Ost, who finds it to be\r\n[_a_]_{D}²⁰ ° = 137°.04 ± 0.19.[155]\r\n\r\n=189. Solutions of Starch at High Pressure.=—Starch may also be brought\r\ninto a condition suited to polarization by dissolving in water at a\r\nhigh temperature and pressure. The solution is accomplished in an\r\nautoclave as described in =181=.\r\n\r\nFrom two to three grams of starch are used and from eighty to ninety\r\ncubic centimeters of water. The starch is first reduced to a pasty\r\nstate by heating with the water and, when evenly distributed throughout\r\nthe flask, is rendered soluble by heating from three to five hours in\r\nan autoclave at from two to three atmospheres. The material is entirely\r\nwithout action on an alkaline copper solution. After heating, the\r\nvolume of the solution is completed to 100 cubic centimeters and it is\r\nthen polarized. The gyrodynat of starch dissolved in this way varies\r\nfrom [_a_]_{D} = 196°.5 to 197°.[156]\r\n\r\nStarch is prepared by Baudry for polarization by boiling with salicylic\r\nacid.[157] The gyrodynat of starch dissolved in this way is [_a_]_{D} =\r\n200°.25.\r\n\r\n=190. Polarization after Solution in Dilute Nitric Acid.=—Guichard\r\nrecommends saccharification with ten per cent nitric acid (ten cubic\r\ncentimeters strong acid, ninety cubic centimeters water).[158] This\r\ntreatment, even after prolonged boiling, gives only a light straw color\r\nto the solution which does not interfere with its polarization with a\r\nlaurent instrument.\r\n\r\nIn working on cereals four grams of the finely ground material, in\r\nwhich the bran and flour are intimately mixed, are used.\r\n\r\nThe material is placed in a flask of about 500 cubic centimeters\r\ncapacity, with 100 cubic centimeters of the dilute acid. The flask is\r\nclosed with a stopper carrying a reflux condenser. After boiling for\r\nan hour the contents of the flask are filtered and examined in the\r\nsaccharimeter. The dextrose formed is determined by the polarimetric\r\ndata and the quantity of starch transformed calculated from the\r\ndextrose. The following formula is used:\r\n\r\n           _av_ × 25 × 0.016\r\n    _A_ = ------------------.\r\n                 2 × 52.8\r\n\r\nIn this formula _a_ = the rotation in angular degrees, _v_ = the volume\r\nof the liquid and _A_ = the starch transformed.\r\n\r\nIn this method no account is taken of the sucrose and other sugars\r\nwhich are present in cereals. In the case of sucrose the left-handed\r\nsugar produced by treatment with nitric acid would diminish the\r\nrotation to the right and thus introduce an error. On the other hand\r\nthe dextrose formed from the fiber of the bran would be calculated as\r\nstarch. If these two errors should be compensating the method might\r\nprove practical.\r\n\r\n=191. Rapid Estimation Of Starch.=—For the rapid estimation of starch\r\nin cereals, cattle foods and brewery refuse, Hibbard recommends a\r\nmethod which is carried out as follows:\r\n\r\nThe malt extract is prepared by covering ground, dry malt with water\r\ncontaining from fifteen to twenty per cent of alcohol. The object of\r\nadding alcohol is to preserve the filtered extract. It exercises a\r\nslight retarding effect on the action of the diastase, but prevents the\r\nmalt extract from fermenting. After standing for a few hours in contact\r\nwith the malt, the liquid is separated by filtration and is then ready\r\nfor use. The substance in which the starch is to be determined should\r\nbe dry enough to be finely pulverized, but previous extraction with\r\nether is omitted. Enough of the material to contain at least half a\r\ngram of starch is placed in a flask with fifty cubic centimeters of\r\nwater and from one to two cubic centimeters of malt extract added. The\r\nmixture is at once heated to boiling with frequent shaking to prevent\r\nthe formation of clots. The addition of the diastase before boiling is\r\nto aid in preventing the formation of lumps. After boiling a minute\r\nthe mixture is cooled to 60° and from two to three cubic centimeters\r\nof the malt extract added. It is then slowly heated until it again\r\nboils, consuming about fifteen minutes, when, after cooling, it is\r\ntested with iodin for starch. If a blue color be produced the operation\r\nabove described is repeated until it fails to reappear. The mixture\r\nis then made up to a standard volume, thrown on a linen filter and an\r\naliquot part of the filtrate, representing from 200 to 300 milligrams\r\nof starch, is boiled with five cubic centimeters of hydrochloric acid,\r\nof thirty per cent strength, for half an hour. The total volume of the\r\nliquid before boiling should be completed to sixty cubic centimeters.\r\nBy the method above described, it is claimed that the determination of\r\nstarch in a cereal or similar substance can be completed within two\r\nhours. The chief amount of time saved is in the heating with the malt\r\nextract, which instead of being continued for two hours, as usually\r\ndirected, can be accomplished in thirty minutes.[159]\r\n\r\n=192. Precipitation of Starch with Barium Hydroxid.=—The tendency of\r\ncarbohydrate bodies to unite with the earthy bases has been utilized by\r\nAsboth as a basis for the quantitive determination of starch.[160]\r\n\r\nAbout three grams of the finely ground sample containing the starch,\r\nor one gram of pure starch, are rubbed up in a mortar with water and\r\nthe detached starch remaining suspended in the wash water is poured\r\noff. This operation is repeated until all the starch is removed. In\r\ndifficult cases hot water may be used. The starch thus separated is\r\nheated in a quarter liter flask to the boiling point to reduce it to\r\nthe condition of paste. When the paste is cold it is treated with fifty\r\ncubic centimeters of the barium hydroxid solution, the flask closed and\r\nwell shaken for two minutes. The volume is then completed to the mark\r\nwith forty-five per cent alcohol, the flask well shaken and allowed\r\nto stand. In a short time the barium-starch compound separates and\r\nsettles. Fifty cubic centimeters of the clear supernatant liquor are\r\nremoved with a pipette, or the liquor may be passed through a filter\r\nand the quantity mentioned removed for titration of the residual barium\r\nhydroxid after the addition of a few drops of phenolphthalein solution.\r\n\r\nThe quantity of barium hydroxid remaining, deducted from the original\r\nquantity, gives the amount which has entered into composition with\r\nthe starch; the composition of the molecule being BaOC₂₄H₄₀O₂₀, which\r\ncontains 19.10 per cent of barium oxid and 80.90 per cent of starch.\r\n\r\nThe set solution of barium hydroxid must be preserved from contact with\r\nthe carbon dioxid of the air. The burette should be directly attached\r\nto the bottle holding the set solution, by any of the usual appliances,\r\nand the air entering the bottle must be deprived of carbon dioxid. The\r\nwater used in the work must be also free of air, and this is secured by\r\nboiling immediately before use.\r\n\r\n_Example._—A sample of flour selected for the analysis weighed\r\n3.212 grams. The starch was separated and reduced to paste in the\r\nmanner described above. Thirty and four-tenths cubic centimeters of\r\ntenth-normal hydrochloric acid were exactly neutralized by ten cubic\r\ncentimeters of the barium hydroxid solution. After treatment as above\r\ndescribed, fifty cubic centimeters of the clear liquor, corresponding\r\nto ten cubic centimeters of the added barium hydroxid, required 19.05\r\ncubic centimeters of tenth-normal hydrochloric acid. Then 30.4 - 19.05\r\n= 11.35, and 11.35 x 5 = 56.75, which number corresponds to the total\r\ntitration of the residual barium hydroxid in terms of tenth-normal\r\nhydrochloric acid. This number multiplied by 0.0324, _viz._, starch\r\ncorresponding to one equivalent of barium, gave 1.8387 grams of starch\r\nor 57.24 per cent of the weight of flour employed.\r\n\r\nThe barium hydroxid method has been given a thorough trial in this\r\nlaboratory and the results have been unsatisfactory when applied to\r\ncereals. The principle of the process, however, appears to be sound,\r\nand with a proper variation of working details, it may become practical.\r\n\r\n=193. Disturbing Bodies in Starch Determinations.=—Stone has made a\r\ncomparison of the standard methods of starch determinations, and the\r\nresults of his work show that in the case of pure starch all of the\r\nstandard methods give approximately correct figures. For instance, in\r\nthe case of a pure potato starch, the following data were obtained:\r\n\r\nBy inversion with hydrochloric acid, 85.75 per cent; by inversion with\r\noxalic and nitric acids, 85.75 per cent; by solution in salicylic acid,\r\n85.47 per cent; and by precipitation with barium hydroxid, 85.58 per\r\ncent.[161]\r\n\r\nWhen these methods are used, however, for the determination of starch\r\nin its original state, the widest variations are secured. Stone shows\r\nthat these variations are due chiefly to the inverting effect of the\r\nreagents employed upon the pentosans present. In experiments made with\r\npure xylan obtained from wheat straw, the methods employed gave from\r\n44.73 to 67.16 per cent of material, which would be calculated by\r\nthe usual methods as starch. Stone also shows that the pentosans are\r\npractically unaffected by the action of diastase or malt extract. Pure\r\nxylan treated with diastase, under the condition in which starch is\r\nconverted into maltose and other soluble carbohydrates, fails to give\r\nany subsequent reaction whatever with alkaline copper solution. In\r\nall cases, therefore, where starch occurs in conjunction with pentose\r\nbodies, it is necessary to separate it by diastatic action before\r\napplying any of the methods of conversion of the starch into dextrose\r\nor its precipitation by barium hydroxid.\r\n\r\n=194. Colorimetric Estimation of Starch.=—The production of the\r\nintensely blue color which starch gives with iodin has been used not\r\nonly as the basis of a qualitive method, but also of many attempts at\r\nquantitive determination. These attempts have, as a rule, been attended\r\nwith very unsatisfactory results, due both to the extraordinary\r\ndelicacy of the reaction and to the fact that starches of different\r\norigin do not always give exactly the same intensity of tint when\r\npresent in the same quantity. At the present it must be admitted that\r\nlittle should be expected of any quantitive colorimetric test.\r\n\r\nIn case such a test is desired the procedure described by Dennstedt\r\nand Voigtländer may be followed.[162] A weighed quantity of the\r\nstarch-holding material, containing approximately half a gram of\r\nstarch, is placed in a two liter flask and boiled with a liter of\r\nwater. After cooling, the volume is completed to two liters and\r\nthe starch allowed to subside. Five cubic centimeters of the clear\r\nsupernatant liquor are placed in a graduated cylinder holding 100, and\r\nmarked in half cubic centimeters. One drop of a solution of iodin in\r\npotassium iodid is added and the volume completed to the mark. A half\r\ngram of pure starch is treated in the same way and different measured\r\nportions of the solution treated as above until the color of the first\r\ncylinder is matched. From the quantity of pure starch in the matched\r\ncylinder the quantity in the sample is determined. The test should be\r\nmade in duplicate or triplicate. If a violet color be produced instead\r\nof a blue, it may be remedied by treating the sample with alcohol\r\nbefore the starch granules are dissolved.\r\n\r\n=195. Fixation of Iodin.=—In addition to forming a distinctive blue\r\ncolor with iodin, starches have the power of fixing considerable\r\nquantities of that substance. The starches of the cereals have this\r\npower in a higher degree than those derived from potatoes. In presence\r\nof a large excess of iodin the starches of rice and wheat have a\r\nmaximum iodin-fixing power of about nineteen per cent of their weight.\r\nWhen only enough of iodin is employed to enter into combination\r\nthe percentage absorbed varies from nine to fifteen per cent. The\r\nabsorption of iodin by starches is a matter of importance from a\r\ngeneral chemical standpoint, but as at present determined has but\r\nlittle analytical value. It is evident, however, that this absorption\r\nmust take place according to definite chemical quantities and the\r\nresearches of investigators may in the future discover some definite\r\nquantitive method of measuring it.[163]\r\n\r\n=196. Identification of Starches of Different Origin.=—It is often\r\nimportant, especially in cases of suspected adulteration, to determine\r\nthe origin of the starch granules. For this purpose the microscope\r\nis the sole resort. In many cases it is easy to determine the origin\r\nof the starch by the size or the shape and marking of the grains. In\r\nmixtures of more than one kind of starch the distinguishing features of\r\nthe several starches can be clearly made out in most instances. There\r\nare, however, many instances where it is impossible to discriminate\r\nby reason of the fact that the characteristics of starch granules\r\nvary even in the same substance and from year to year with varying\r\nconditions of culture.\r\n\r\nIn many cases the illustrations of the forms and characteristics of\r\nstarch granules which are found in books are misleading and no reliance\r\ncan be placed on any illustrations which are not either photographs or\r\ndrawings made directly from them. In the microscopic study of starches\r\nthe analyst will be greatly helped by the following descriptions of the\r\ncharacteristic appearance of the granules and the classifications based\r\nthereon.[164]\r\n\r\n=197. Vogel’s Table of the Different Starches and Arrowroots of\r\nCommerce.=—_A._ Granules simple, bounded by rounded surfaces.\r\n\r\n    I.

Blyth’s Classification.=—Blyth gives the following scheme for the\r\nidentification of starch granules by their microscopic appearance.[165]\r\n\r\n_Division I.—Starches showing a play of colors with polarized light and\r\nselenite plate_:\r\n\r\nThe hilum and concentric rings are clearly visible, and all the starch\r\ngranules, oval or ovate. Canna arrowroot, potato, arrowroot, calumba,\r\norris root, ginger, galangal and turmeric belong to this division.\r\n\r\n_Division II.—Starches showing no iridescence, or scarcely any, when\r\nexamined by polarized light and selenite_:\r\n\r\nClass I.—The concentric rings are all but invisible, and the hilum\r\nstellate. The bean, pea, maize, lentil, dari and nutmeg starches are in\r\nthis class.\r\n\r\nClass II.—Starches which have both the concentric rings and hilum\r\ninvisible in the majority of granules: this important class includes\r\nwheat, barley, rye, chestnut, acorn, and many starches in medicinal\r\nplants.\r\n\r\nClass III.—All the granules are truncated at one end. This class\r\nincludes sago, tapioca and arum, several drugs and cinnamon and cassia.\r\n\r\nClass IV.—In this class all the granules are angular in form and it\r\nincludes oats, tacca, rice, pepper and ipecacuanha.\r\n\r\n=200. Preparation of Starches for Microscopical Examination.=—The\r\napproximately pure starches of commerce may be prepared for microscopic\r\nexamination by rubbing them up with water and mounting some of the\r\nsuspended particles by one of the methods to be described below.\r\n\r\nIn grains, seeds and nuts the starch is separated by grinding with\r\nwater and working through fine linen. The starch which is worked\r\nthrough is allowed to subside, again beaten up with water if necessary\r\nand the process continued until the grains are separated sufficiently\r\nfor microscopic examination. A little potash or soda lye may be used,\r\nif necessary, to separate the granules from albuminous and other\r\nadhering matter. The analyst should have a collection of samples of all\r\ncommon starches of known origin for purposes of comparison.\r\n\r\nThe granules are mounted for examination by plain light in a medium\r\nof glycerol and camphor water. When polarized light is used the\r\nmounting should be in Canada balsam.[166] The reader can find excellent\r\nphotomicrographs of the more common starches in Griffith’s book.[167]\r\n\r\n=201. Appearance in Balsam with Polarized Light.=—Mounted in balsam\r\nthe starches are scarcely visible under any form of illumination\r\nwith ordinary light, the index of refraction of the granules and the\r\nbalsam being so nearly alike. When, however, polarized light is used\r\nthe effect is a striking one. It is very easy to distinguish all the\r\ncharacteristics, except the rings, the center of the cross being at the\r\nnucleus of the granule.\r\n\r\nWith the selenite plate a play of colors is produced, which is peculiar\r\nto some of the starches and forms the basis of Blyth’s classification.\r\n\r\n=202. Description Of Typical Starches.=—The more commonly occurring\r\nstarches are described by Richardson as they appear under the\r\nmicroscope magnified about 350 diameters.[168]\r\n\r\nThe illustrations, with the exception of the cassava starch, and the\r\nmaize starch accompanying it were drawn by the late Dr. Geo. Marx from\r\nphotographs made by Richardson in this laboratory. The two samples\r\nexcepted were photographed for the author by Dr. G. L. Spencer.\r\n\r\n_Maranta Starch._—Of the same type as the potato starch are the various\r\narrowroots, the only one of which commonly met with in this country\r\nbeing the Bermuda, the starch of the rhizome of _Maranta arundinacea_,\r\nand the starch of turmeric.\r\n\r\nThe granules are usually not so varied in size or shape as those of\r\nthe potato, averaging about 0.07 millimeter in length as may be seen\r\nin Fig. 48. They are about the same size as the average of the potato,\r\nbut are not often found with the same maximum or minimum magnitude,\r\nwhich circumstance, together with the fact that the end at which the\r\nnucleus appears is broader in the maranta and more pointed in the\r\npotato, enables one to distinguish the two starches without difficulty.\r\nWith polarized light the results are similar to those seen with potato\r\nstarch, and this is a ready means of distinguishing the two varieties,\r\nby displaying in a striking way the form of the granule and position of\r\nthe hilum.\r\n\r\n_Potato Starch._—The starch grains of the potato are very variable in\r\nsize, being found from 0.05 to 0.10 millimeter in length, and in shape\r\nfrom oval and allied forms to irregular and even round in the smallest.\r\nThese variations are illustrated in Fig. 49, but the frequency of the\r\nsmaller granules is not as evident as in some other cases. The layers\r\nare visible in some granules with great distinctness and in others\r\nhardly at all, being rather more prominent in the starch as obtained\r\nfrom a freshly cut surface. The rings are more distinct, too, near\r\nthe hilum or nucleus, which in this, as in all tuberous starches, is\r\neccentric, shading off toward the broader or more expanded portion\r\nof the granule. The hilum appears as a shadowy depression, and with\r\npolarized light its position is well marked by the junction of the arms\r\nof the cross. With polarized light and a selenite plate a beautiful\r\nplay of colors is obtained. The smaller granules, which are nearly\r\nround, may readily be confused with other starches, but their presence\r\nserves at once to distinguish this from maranta or Bermuda arrowroot\r\nstarch. Rarely compound granules are found composed of two or three\r\nsingle ones each with its own nucleus.\r\n\r\n_Ginger Starch._—This starch is of the same class as those from the\r\npotato and maranta and several others which are of underground origin.\r\nIn outline the granules are not oval like those named, but more\r\nrectangular, having more obtuse angles in the larger ones and being\r\ncylindrical or circular in outline in the smaller, as indicated in Fig.\r\n50. They average nearly the same size as maranta starch, but are much\r\nmore variable, both in size and form. The rings are scarcely visible\r\neven with the most favorable illuminations.\r\n\r\n_Sago Starch._—This exists in two modifications in the market; as raw\r\nand as prepared sago. In the prepared condition it is characterized by\r\na larger circular depression in the center of most of the granules. The\r\nrings are not visible. They are mostly circular in form or approaching\r\nit, and vary from 0.025 to 0.065 millimeter in diameter, as indicated\r\nin Fig. 51.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 48.

INDIAN CORN STARCH × 150.\r\n\r\nPLAIN ILLUMINATION.\r\n\r\nA. Hoen & Co., Lithocaustic]\r\n\r\n_Pea and Bean Starches._—These starches produce but a slight effect\r\nwith polarized light. The rings are scarcely visible, and the hilum is\r\nstellate or much cracked along a median line, the bean more so than the\r\npea, the latter resembling fresh dough kneaded again into the center\r\nas in making rolls, and the former the shape assumed by the same after\r\nbaking. The grains of both are somewhat variable in size, ranging from\r\n0.025 to 0.10 millimeter in length, as shown in Figs. 52 and 53.\r\n\r\n_Wheat Starch_ grains are quite variable in size, varying from 0.05\r\nto 0.010 millimeter in diameter. They belong to the same class as\r\nbarley and rye, the hilum being invisible and the rings not prominent.\r\nThe granules are circular disks in form, and there are now and then\r\ncontorted depressions resembling those in pea starch. They are the\r\nleast regular of the three starches named and do not polarize actively.\r\nThe typical forms of these granules are shown in Fig. 54.\r\n\r\n_Barley Starch_ is quite similar to that of wheat, but the grains do\r\nnot vary so much in size, averaging 0.05 millimeter. They have rings\r\nwhich are much more distinct, and very small granules adhering to the\r\nlargest in bud-like forms, as seen in Fig. 55.\r\n\r\n_Rye Starch_ is more variable in size, many of the granules not\r\nexceeding 0.02 millimeter, while the largest reach 0.06 to 0.07\r\nmillimeter. It lacks distinctive characteristics entirely, and is the\r\nmost simple in form of all the starches. Fig. 56 shows the appearance\r\nof the granules under the microscope.\r\n\r\n_Oat Starch_ is unique, being composed of large compound masses of\r\npolyhedral granules from 0.12 to 0.02 millimeter in length, the single\r\ngranules averaging 0.02 to 0.015 millimeter. It does not polarize\r\nactively, and displays neither rings nor hilum. The illustration, Fig.\r\n57, shows its nature with accuracy.\r\n\r\n_Indian Corn Starch._—The granules of maize starch are largely of\r\nthe same size, from 0.02 to 0.03 millimeter in diameter, with now\r\nand then a few which are much smaller. They are mostly circular in\r\nshape or rather polyhedral, with rounded angles, as shown in Figs. 58\r\nand 61. They form very brilliant objects with polarized light, but\r\nwith ordinary illumination show but the faintest sign of rings and a\r\nwell-developed hilum, at times star-shaped, and at others more like a\r\ncircular depression.\r\n\r\n_Rice Starch_ is very similar to that of maize, and is easily confused\r\nwith it, the grains being about the same size. The grain, however,\r\nis distinguished from it by its polygonal form, and its well defined\r\nangles, as indicated in Fig. 59. The hilum is more prominent and more\r\noften stellate or linear. Several granules are at times united.\r\n\r\n_Cassava Starch._—This variety of starch is obtained from the root of\r\nthe sweet cassava, which grows in great profusion in Florida. It is\r\ncompared with maize starch in Figs. 60 and 61. In the illustration the\r\ngranules are represented as magnified 150 diameters. The grains of the\r\ncassava starch measure about 0.012 millimeter in diameter and resemble\r\nvery nearly maize starch, except that they have greater evenness of\r\noutline.[169]\r\n\r\nFor further descriptions of starch grains the reader is referred to the\r\nwork of Griffith, already cited.\r\n\r\nThese descriptions, it will be seen, do not agree entirely with those\r\nof some other authors, but they are based on a somewhat extensive\r\nexperience.\r\n\r\nThere are peculiarities of size, shape and appearance of starch\r\ngranules, which must be allowed for, and the necessity for every\r\ninvestigator to compare a starch which he is desirous of identifying\r\nwith authentic specimens, must always be recognized.\r\n\r\n\r\nAUTHORITIES CITED IN PART SECOND.\r\n\r\n[23] Vines, Vegetable Physiology.\r\n\r\n[24] Berichte der deutschen chemischen Gesellschaft, Band 23, S. 2136;\r\nStone, Agricultural Science Vol. 6, p. 180.

Introduction.=—In the preceding part directions have been given\r\nfor the estimation of sugars and starches in approximately pure forms.\r\nIn the present part will be described the most approved methods of\r\nseparating these bodies and other carbohydrates from crude agricultural\r\nproducts and for their chemical examination. In many respects the\r\nprocesses which in a small way are used for preparing samples for\r\nanalysis are employed on a large scale for technical and manufacturing\r\npurposes. It is evident, however, that the following paragraphs must be\r\nconfined strictly to the analytical side of the question inasmuch as\r\nanything more than mere references to technical processes would lead\r\ninto wide digressions.\r\n\r\nIn the case of sugars the analyst is for the most part quite as much in\r\nneed of reliable methods of extraction and preparation as of processes\r\nfor analysis. With starches the matter is more simple and the chief\r\nmethods of separating them for examination were necessarily described\r\nin the previous part.\r\n\r\nSugars in fresh plants exist almost entirely in solution. This is true\r\nof all the great sources of the sugar of commerce, _viz._, the palm,\r\nthe maple, the sugar beet and sugar cane. This statement is also true\r\nof fruits and the natural nectar of flowers. By natural or artificial\r\ndrying the sugar may be reduced to the solid or semisolid state as in\r\nthe cases of raisins and honey. In certain seeds, deficient in water,\r\nsugars may possibly exist in a solid state naturally, as may be the\r\ncase with sucrose in the peanut and raffinose in cotton seed.\r\n\r\nStarches on the other hand when soluble, are probably not true\r\nstarches, but they partake more or less of a dextrinoid nature. Fine\r\nstarch particles occur abundantly in the juices of some plants,\r\nas for instance sorghum, where they are associated with sugar and\r\ncan be obtained from the expressed juice by subsidence. But even\r\nin such a case it is not certain that the starch enters into the\r\ngeneral circulation. It is more likely formed locally by biochemical\r\ncondensation of its constituents. Starches in a soluble or semisoluble\r\nstate are transported, as a rule, to the tubers or seeds of plants\r\nwhere they are accumulated in large quantities as a reserve food for\r\nfuture growth. For a study of the plant metabolism whereby starch is\r\nproduced and for its histological and physiological properties the\r\nreader may consult the standard authorities on vegetable physiology.[170]\r\n\r\n=204. Sugar in the Sap of Trees.=—Many trees at certain seasons of the\r\nyear, carry large quantities of sugar in their sap. Among these the\r\nmaple and sugar palm are preeminent. The sap is secured by cutting a\r\npocket into the side of the tree or by boring into it and allowing the\r\nsap to run into an appropriate receptacle through a spile. The content\r\nof sugar in the sap of the maple and palm varies greatly. In some cases\r\nit falls as low as one and a half and in others rises to as much as\r\nsix or seven per cent.[171] In most cases the sugar in the maple sap is\r\npure sucrose, but towards the end of the flowing season it may undergo\r\nchanges of a viscous nature due to fermentation, or inversion, forming\r\ntraces of invert sugar. In this country the sap of the maple may flow\r\nfreely on any warm day in winter, but the sugar season proper begins\r\nabout February 15th in Southern Ohio and Indiana, and about March 25th\r\nin Vermont. It lasts from six weeks to two months. The sap flows best\r\nduring moderately warm, still days, after a light freeze.\r\n\r\nIn addition to sugar the maple sap contains a trace of albuminoid\r\nmatters and some malic acid combined with lime. As a rule it can be\r\nsubjected to polarization without preliminary clarification.\r\n\r\n=205. Determination of Sugar in Saps.=—In most cases the sap may be\r\ndirectly polarized in a 200 millimeter tube. Its specific gravity is\r\nobtained by a spindle or pyknometer, and the percentage of sugars taken\r\ndirectly from the table on page 73, the degree brix corresponding to\r\nthe sugar percentage.\r\n\r\nOn polarizing, the sugar percentage is calculated as follows:\r\n\r\nMultiply the specific gravity of the sap by 100 and divide the product\r\nby 26.048. Divide the direct reading of the sap on the sugar scale by\r\nthe quotient obtained above, and the quotient thus obtained will be the\r\ncorrect percentage of sugar in the original solution.\r\n\r\nThe formula is applicable for those instruments in which 26.048 grams\r\nrepresent the normal quantity of sugar which in 100 cubic centimeters\r\nreads 100 divisions on the scale. When other factors are used they\r\nshould be substituted for 26.048 in the above formula.\r\n\r\nThe principle of the calculation is based on the weight of the sap\r\nwhich is contained in 100 cubic centimeters, and this is evidently\r\nobtained by multiplying 100 by the specific gravity of the sap. Since\r\n26.048 is the normal quantity of sugar in that volume of the solution\r\nthe quotient of the actual weight divided by that factor shows how many\r\ntimes too great the observed polarization is. The simple division of\r\nthe polariscope reading by this factor gives the correct reading.\r\n\r\n_Example_: Let the specific gravity of the sap be 1.015 and the\r\nobserved polarization be 15.0. Then the true percentage of sugar in the\r\nsap is found by the equation:\r\n\r\n101.5 : 26.048 = 15.0 : _x_.\r\n\r\nWhence _x_ = 3.85 = percentage of sugar in the sap.\r\n\r\nThe process outlined above is not applicable when a clarifying reagent\r\nsuch as lead subacetate or alumina cream must be used. But even in\r\nthese cases it will not be found necessary to weigh the sap. A sugar\r\nflask graduated at 100 and 110 cubic centimeters is used and filled to\r\nthe first mark with the sap, the specific gravity of which is known.\r\nThe clarifying reagent is added, the volume completed to the second\r\nmark with water, and the contents of the flask well shaken and thrown\r\non a dry filter. The observation tube, which should be 220 millimeters\r\nin length, is then filled with the clear filtrate and the rest of the\r\nprocess is as described above. A 200 millimeter tube may also be used\r\nin this case and the observed reading increased by one-tenth.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 62. LABORATORY CANE MILL.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 63. WEIGHING PIPETTE.]\r\n\r\n=206. Estimation of Sugar in the Sap of Sugar Cane and Sorghum.=—In\r\nbodies like sugar cane and sorghum the sap containing the sugar will\r\nnot flow as in the cases of the maple and sugar palm. The simplest way\r\nof securing the sap of the bodies named is to subject them to pressure\r\nbetween rolls. A convenient method of obtaining the sap or juice is\r\nby passing the cane through a small three-roll mill indicated in the\r\nfigure. Small mills of this kind have been used in this division for\r\nmany years and with entire satisfaction. Small canes, such as sorghum,\r\nmay be milled one at a time, or even two or three when they are very\r\nsmall. In the case of large canes, it is necessary that they be split\r\nand only half of them used at once. The mill should not be crowded by\r\nthe feed in such a way as to endanger it or make it too difficult for\r\nthe laborer to turn. From fifty to sixty per cent of the weight of a\r\ncane in juice may be obtained by passing it through one of these small\r\nmills. Experience has shown that there is a little difference between\r\nthe juice as first expressed and the residual sap remaining in the\r\nbagasse, but the juice first expressed may be used for analysis for\r\ncontrol purposes as a fair representative of all that the cane contains.\r\n\r\nTo determine the percentage of juice expressed, the canes may be\r\nweighed before passing through the mill and the juice collected. Its\r\nweight divided by the weight of the original cane will give the per\r\ncent of the juice expressed, calculated on the whole cane. Instead of\r\nweighing the juice the bagasse may also be collected and weighed; but\r\non account of the rapidity with which it dries the operation should be\r\naccomplished without delay. The expressed juice is clarified with lead\r\nsubacetate, filtered and polarized in the manner described in former\r\nparagraphs. Instead of weighing the juice, its specific gravity may\r\nbe taken by an accurate spindle and the volume of it, equivalent to a\r\ngiven weight, measured from a sucrose pipette.[172]\r\n\r\nA sucrose pipette for cane juice has a graduation on the upper part\r\nof the stem which enables the operator to deliver double the normal\r\nweight for the polariscope used, after having determined the density of\r\nthe juice by means of a spindle. A graduation of from 5° to 25° of the\r\nbrix spindle will be sufficient for all variations in the density of\r\nthe juice, or one covering a range of from 10° to 20° will suffice for\r\nmost instances. The greater the density of the juice the less volume\r\nof it will be required for the weight mentioned. For general use, the\r\nsucrose pipette is graduated on the stem to deliver from forty-eight\r\nto 50.5 cubic centimeters, the graduations being in terms of the brix\r\nspindle. The graduation of the stem of this instrument is shown in the\r\naccompanying figure. In the use of the pipette it is only necessary\r\nto fill it to the degree on the stem corresponding to the degree brix\r\nfound in the preliminary trial.\r\n\r\nThe quantities of juice corresponding to each degree and fractional\r\ndegree of the brix spindle are given in the following table; calculated\r\nfor the normal weight 26.048 grams for the ventzke and for 16.19 grams\r\nfor the laurent scale. The measured quantities of juice are placed in\r\na 100 cubic centimeter sugar flask, treated with the proper quantity\r\nof lead subacetate, the volume completed to the mark, and the juice\r\nfiltered and polarized in a 200 millimeter tube.

For instance, if the\r\ndegree brix is found to be 19.9, 48.1 cubic centimeters are to be used.\r\nThis quantity can be easily run from a burette. In order to make the\r\npipette more convenient it has been customary in this laboratory, as\r\npracticed by Carr, to attach a glass tube with a stopcock by means of\r\na rubber tube to the upper part of the pipette, whereby the exact\r\nlevel of the juice in the stem of the pipette can be easily set at any\r\nrequired mark.\r\n\r\nIn the polarization of dilute solutions, such as are found in the\r\nsaps and juices referred to above, it must not be forgotten that the\r\ngyrodynat of the sucrose is increased as the density of the solution\r\nis diminished. This change introduces a slight error into the work\r\nwhich is of no consequence from a technical point of view, but\r\nbecomes a matter which must be considered in exact determinations. To\r\navoid the annoyance of calculating the gyrodynat for every degree of\r\nconcentration, tables have been constructed by Schmitz and Crampton by\r\nmeans of which the actual percentage of sugar, corresponding to any\r\ndegree of polarization, is determined by inspection. These tables may\r\nbe used when extremely accurate work is required.[173]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 64. GIRD’S GRAVIMETER.]\r\n\r\n=207. Measuring Sugar Juices with a Gravimeter.=—A convenient method of\r\nweighing sugar juices is the gravimetric process designed by Gird.[174]\r\nThe apparatus is fully illustrated by Fig. 64. The hydrometer F has a\r\nweight of 26.048 grams and its stem is also graduated in degrees brix.\r\nThe juice is poured into the cylinder A and allowed to stand until air\r\nbubbles have escaped. In filling A the finger is held over the orifice\r\nG so that the siphon tube B is completely filled, the air escaping at\r\nthe vent C. After the tube is filled the finger is withdrawn from G and\r\nall the liquid which will run out at G allowed to escape. The sugar\r\nflask D is now brought under G and the hydrometer F allowed to descend\r\ninto A. The hydrometer will displace exactly its own weight of liquid.\r\nFor convenience of reading, the index E may be used which is set five\r\ndegrees above the surface of the liquid in A. The number of degrees\r\nbrix read by E is then diminished by five. The hydrometer has been\r\nimproved since the description given by the addition of a thermometer\r\nwhich, in addition to carrying a graduation in degrees, also shows the\r\ncorrection to be made upon the degree brix for each degree read. It is\r\nevident that the hydrometer may be made of any weight, and thus the\r\ndelivery of any desired amount of juice be secured.\r\n\r\n=208. Determination of Reducing Bodies in Cane Juices.=—Sucrose in\r\ncane juices is constantly accompanied with reducing sugars, or other\r\nbodies which have a similar action on fehling liquor, which interfere\r\nto a considerable degree with the practical manufacture of sugar. It is\r\nimportant to determine with a moderate degree of accuracy the quantity\r\nof these bodies. These sugars or reducing bodies are of a peculiar\r\nnature. The author pointed out many years ago that these reducing\r\nbodies were without action on polarized light, and for this reason\r\nproposed the name anoptose as one characteristic of their nature.[175] It\r\nis also found that these bodies do not yield theoretically the quantity\r\nof alcohol which a true sugar of the hexose type would give.[176] It is\r\nentirely probable, therefore, that they are quite different in their\r\nnature from many of the commonly known sugars. On account of the\r\ndifficulty of separating these bodies in a pure state their actual\r\ncopper reducing power is not known. For practical purposes, however, it\r\nis assumed to be the same as that of dextrose or invert sugar and the\r\npercentage of these bodies present is calculated on that assumption.\r\nIn the determination of these sugars or reducing bodies, the quantity\r\nweighed may be determined by an apparatus entirely similar to the\r\nsucrose pipette just described above. The quantity of juice used should\r\nbe diluted as a rule to such a degree as not to contain more than one\r\nper cent of the reducing bodies. For the best work, the juices should\r\nbe clarified with lead subacetate and the excess of lead removed with\r\nsodium carbonate. For technical control work in sugar factories, this\r\nprocess may be omitted as in such cases rapidity of work is a matter\r\nof considerable importance and the approximate estimation of the total\r\nquantity of reducing bodies is all that is desired.\r\n\r\nFor volumetric work, the solution of copper and the method of\r\nmanipulation described in paragraph =117= are most conveniently used.\r\n\r\n=209. Preservation of Sugar Juices for Analysis.=—Lead subacetate not\r\nonly clarifies the juices of canes and thus permits of their more exact\r\nanalytical examination, but also exercises preservative effects which\r\nenable it to be used as a preserving agent and thus greatly diminish\r\nthe amount of work necessary in the technical control of a sugar\r\nfactory. Instead, therefore, of the analyst being compelled to make an\r\nexamination of every sample of the juice, aliquot portions representing\r\nthe different quantities can be preserved and one analysis made for\r\nall. This method has been thoroughly investigated by Edson, who also\r\nfinds that the errors, which may be introduced by the use of the lead\r\nsubacetate in the analytical work, may be entirely avoided by using the\r\nnormal lead acetate.[177]\r\n\r\nIn the use of the normal lead acetate, much less acetic acid is\r\nrequired in the polariscopic work than when the subacetate is used.\r\nThe normal lead acetate is not so good a clarifying agent as the\r\nsubacetate, but its efficiency in this respect is increased by the\r\naddition of a little acetic acid. In its use, it is not necessary to\r\nremove the lead, even for the determination of the reducing bodies.\r\n\r\nFor further details in regard to the technical determination of\r\nreducing bodies, special works may be consulted.[178]\r\n\r\n=210. Direct Determination of Sugars in Canes.=—The methods, which\r\nhave just been described, of securing the juices of cane by pressure\r\nand of determining the sugars therein, do not give the actual\r\npercentage of sugar in the cane. An approximate result may be secured\r\nby assuming that the cane is composed of ninety parts of juice and\r\nten parts of cellular tissues and other insoluble matters. This\r\nassumption is approximately true in most cases, but there are often\r\nconditions arising which render the data calculated on the above\r\nassumption misleading. In any particular case in order to be certain\r\nthat the correct percentage of sugar is secured it will be necessary\r\nto determine the fiber in the cane. This is an analytical process of\r\nconsiderable labor and especially so on account of the difficulty of\r\nsecuring samples which represent the average composition of the cane.\r\nThe fibrous structure of the canes, the hardness of their external\r\ncovering and the toughness of their nodes or joints render the\r\nsampling extremely difficult. Moreover, the content of sugar varies\r\nin different parts of the cane. The parts nearest the ground are,\r\nas a rule, richer than the upper joints and this is especially true\r\nof sugar cane. In order, therefore, to get a fair sample, even of a\r\nsingle cane, all parts of it must be considered. Several methods of the\r\ndirect determination of sugar in canes have been proposed and will be\r\ndescribed below.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 65. MACHINE FOR CUTTING CANES.]\r\n\r\n=211. Methods of Cutting or Shredding the Cane for Analytical\r\nPurposes.=—A simple method of cutting canes into small pieces which\r\nwill permit of an even sampling is very much to be desired. The\r\ncutting apparatus shown in Fig. 65 has been long in use in this\r\nlaboratory. The canes by it are cut into thin slices, but the cutting\r\nedge of the knife being perpendicular to the length of the cane renders\r\nthe use of the instrument somewhat laborious and unsatisfactory. A\r\nconsiderable time is required to cut a single cane and the slices which\r\nare formed should be received in a vessel which will protect them as\r\nmuch as possible from evaporation during the process of the work.\r\nInstead of the apparatus above a small cane cutting machine arranged\r\nwith four knives on a revolving disk maybe used. The apparatus is shown\r\nin Fig. 66. The cane is fed against the knives through the hole shown\r\nin the open front of the apparatus and the knives thus strike the cane\r\nobliquely.[179] The knives can be set in the revolving disk at any\r\ndesired position so as to cut the canes into chips as fine as may be\r\ndesired. The cossettes furnished by this method may be sampled directly\r\nfor the extraction of the sugar. In the case of the cossettes from\r\nboth instruments described above a finer subdivision may be secured by\r\npassing them through a sausage cutter.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 66. CANE CUTTING MILL.]\r\n\r\nThe best method for shredding canes, however, is to pass them through\r\nthe apparatus described on page 9. That machine gives an extremely\r\nfine, moist mass, which is of uniform nature and capable of being\r\ndirectly sampled.\r\n\r\n=212. Methods of Determination.=—Even the finely divided material\r\nobtained by the machine just described is not suited to give an\r\ninstantaneous diffusion for polarization as is done by the finely\r\nground beet pulp to be described further on. For the determination of\r\nsugar a proper weight of the cossettes or pulp obtained as described\r\nabove, taken after thorough mixing, is placed in a flask graduated\r\nproperly and treated with water.[180]\r\n\r\nThe flask in which the mixture takes place should be marked to\r\ncompensate for the volume of the fiber of the cane. When the normal\r\nweight of cane is taken for the ventzke scale, _viz._, 26.048, the\r\nflask should be graduated at 102.6 cubic centimeters. If double the\r\nnormal weight be taken, the flask should be graduated at 205.2 cubic\r\ncentimeters. This graduation is based on the assumption of the presence\r\nof fiber amounting to ten per cent of the weight of the cossettes. The\r\nfiber is so nearly the density of the juice obtained as to be regarded\r\nas one gram equal to one cubic centimeter. The flask is at first filled\r\nalmost full of water and then warmed to near the boiling point for an\r\nhour with frequent shaking. It is then filled to a little above the\r\nmark, the contents well mixed and warmed for ten minutes more with\r\nfrequent shaking. After cooling, the volume is made up to the mark,\r\nwell shaken and poured upon a filter. The filtrate is collected in a\r\nsugar flask marked at fifty and fifty-five cubic centimeters. When\r\nfilled to the first mark a proper quantity of lead subacetate is added,\r\nthe volume completed to the second mark with water, the contents of the\r\nflask well shaken, poured upon a filter and the filtrate polarized in\r\nthe usual way.\r\n\r\nThe reducing sugar is determined in an aliquot part of the filtrate by\r\none of the alkaline copper methods.\r\n\r\n=213. Determination by Drying and Extraction.=—Instead of the diffusion\r\nand polarization method just described, the fine pulp obtained may\r\nbe dried, the dried residue ground in a drug mill and extracted with\r\naqueous alcohol or with water.\r\n\r\nTo facilitate the calculation when this method is employed, the water\r\ncontent of a small portion of the well sampled pulp is determined. The\r\nrest of the pulp is dried, first for a few hours at a temperature not\r\nabove 60° or 70°, and then at the temperature of boiling water, either\r\nin the open air or a partial vacuum, until all the water is driven off.\r\nThe dried residue can then be preserved in well stoppered bottles for\r\nthe determination of sugar at any convenient period. The finely ground\r\ndried residue for this purpose is placed in an extraction apparatus\r\nand thoroughly exhausted with eighty per cent alcohol. The extract is\r\ndried and weighed, giving the total weight of all sugars present. After\r\nweighing, the extract is dissolved in water, made up to a definite\r\nvolume and the reducing sugars determined in an aliquot portion thereof\r\nby the usual methods. The weight of reducing sugars found, calculated\r\nfor the whole extract deducted from the total weight of this extract\r\nwill give the weight of the sucrose in the sample. From this number the\r\ncontent of sugar in the original cane is determined from the percentage\r\nof water found in the original sample.\r\n\r\n_Example._—In a sample of finely pulped canes the content of water is\r\nfound to be 76.5 per cent. The thoroughly dried pulp is ground and\r\nextracted with aqueous alcohol. Five grams give two and five-tenths\r\ngrams of the extract. The extract is dissolved in water, made up to\r\na definite volume and the reducing sugars determined in an aliquot\r\npart and calculated for the whole, amounting to 150 milligrams. The\r\nextract is therefore composed of 2.35 grams of sucrose and 0.15 gram\r\nof reducing sugars. The calculation is now made to the original sample\r\nwhich contained 76.5 per cent of water and 23.5 per cent of dry matter,\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\n     5 : _x_ :: 23.5 : 100, whence _x_ = 21.27,\r\n\r\nthe weight of the original material corresponding to five grams of the\r\ndry substance. The original composition of the sample is therefore\r\nexpressed by the following numbers:\r\n\r\n                              Per cent.\r\n    Sucrose                     11.1\r\n    Reducing sugars              0.7\r\n    Water                       76.5\r\n    Fiber (insoluble matter)    11.7\r\n\r\n=214. Examination of the Bagasse.=—The method just described for the\r\nexamination of canes may be also applied to the analysis of bagasses,\r\nwith the changes made necessary by the increased percentage of fiber\r\ntherein. On account of the large surface exposed by the bagasse, the\r\nsampling, shredding and weighing should be accomplished as speedily as\r\npossible to avoid loss of moisture.\r\n\r\nThe optical examination of bagasses is rendered difficult by reason of\r\nthe uneven pressure to which the canes are subjected. With fairly good\r\nmilling in technical work the bagasses will have at least thirty per\r\ncent of fiber. The method for the polariscopic examination is therefore\r\nbased upon that assumption, but the volume of the solution must be\r\nchanged for varying percentages of fiber in the bagasse. On account of\r\nthe smaller percentage of sugar, it is convenient to take double or\r\nthree times the normal weight of the bagasse for examination. Since\r\nlarge sugar flasks are not commonly to be had the diffusion of the\r\nbagasse may be conducted in a quarter liter flask. In a quarter liter\r\nflask place 52.096 grams of the finely shredded bagasse, very nearly\r\nfill the flask with water and extract the sugar as described for canes\r\nin the foregoing paragraphs. In the weight of bagasse used there will\r\nbe, in round numbers, fifteen grams of fiber. When the volume of water\r\nis completed to the mark the actual content of liquid in the flask will\r\ntherefore be only 235 cubic centimeters. Fifty cubic centimeters of the\r\nfiltrate are placed in a sugar flask marked at fifty and fifty-five\r\ncubic centimeters, the proper quantity of lead subacetate solution\r\nadded, the volume completed to the upper mark, the contents of the\r\nflask well shaken, filtered and polarized in a 200 millimeter tube. Let\r\nthe reading obtained be four degrees and increase this by one-tenth for\r\nthe increased volume of solution above fifty cubic centimeters. The\r\ntrue reading is therefore four degrees and four-tenths. This reading,\r\nhowever, must be corrected, because the original volume instead of\r\nbeing 200 cubic centimeters, is 235 cubic centimeters. The actual\r\npercentage of sugar in the sample examined is obtained by the following\r\nproportion:\r\n\r\n    200 : 235 = 4.4 : _x_.\r\n\r\nThe correct reading is therefore 5°.2, the percentage of sugar in the\r\nsample examined.\r\n\r\nThe results obtained by the method just described may vary somewhat\r\nfrom the true percentage by reason of the variation of the content\r\nof fiber in the bagasse. It is, however, sufficiently accurate for\r\ntechnical control in sugar factories and on account of its rapidity\r\nof execution is to be preferred for this purpose. More accurate\r\nresults would be obtained by drying the bagasse, and proceeding with\r\nthe examination in a manner entirely analogous to that described for\r\nthe extraction of sugar from dried canes by aqueous alcohol. In both\r\ninstances the reducing sugar is determined in the manner already\r\nmentioned.\r\n\r\n=215. Determination of Fiber in Cane.=—In estimating the content\r\nof sugar in canes by the analysis of the expressed juices, it is\r\nimportant to make frequent determinations of the fiber for the purpose\r\nof obtaining correct data for calculation. In periods of excessive\r\ndrought, or when the canes are quite mature, the relative content of\r\nfiber is increased, while, on the other hand, in case of immature\r\ncanes, or during excessive rainfalls, it is diminished. The chief\r\ndifficulty in determining the content of fiber in canes is found in\r\nsecuring a representative sample. On account of the hard and fibrous\r\nnature of the envelope and of their nodular tissues, canes are reduced\r\nto a fine pulp with great difficulty by the apparatus in ordinary\r\nuse. A fairly homogeneous pulp, however, may be obtained by means of\r\nthe shredder described on page 9. The canes having been shredded as\r\nfinely as possible, a weighed quantity is placed in any convenient\r\nextraction apparatus and thoroughly exhausted with hot water. The\r\ntreatment with hot water should be continued until a few drops of the\r\nextract evaporated on a watch glass will leave no sensible residue.\r\nThe residual fiber is dried to constant weight at the temperature of\r\nboiling water, cooled in a desiccator and rapidly weighed and the\r\npercentage of fiber calculated from the data obtained. On account of\r\nthe great difficulty of securing a homogeneous pulp, even with the best\r\nshredding machines, the determination should be made in duplicate or\r\ntriplicate and the mean of the results entered as the percentage of\r\nfiber. The term fiber as used in this sense, must not be confounded\r\nwith the same term employed in the analysis of fodders and feeding\r\nstuffs. In the latter case the term is applied to the residue left\r\nafter the successive treatment of the material with boiling, dilute\r\nacid and alkali. The analysis of canes for feeding purposes is\r\nconducted in the general manner hereinafter described for fodders.\r\n\r\n=216. Estimation of Sugar in Sugar Beets.=—The methods employed for\r\nthe determination of the sugar content of beets are analogous to those\r\nused for canes, with such variations in the method of extraction as are\r\nmade possible and necessary by the difference in the nature of these\r\nsacchariferous plants. The sugar beet is more free of fiber and the\r\nhard and knotty substances composing the joints of plants are entirely\r\nabsent from their composition. For this reason they are readily\r\nreduced to a fine pulp, from which the sugar is easily extracted.\r\nThe analytical processes are also greatly simplified by the complete\r\nabsence of reducing sugars from the juices of healthy beets. The only\r\nsugar aside from sucrose which is present in these juices is raffinose,\r\nand this is not found in healthy beets, except when they have been\r\ninjured by frost or long keeping. In practical work, therefore, the\r\ndetermination of sucrose completes the analysis in so far as sugars are\r\nconcerned. Four methods of procedure will illustrate all the principles\r\nof the various processes employed.\r\n\r\n=217. Estimation of Sucrose in the Expressed Juice.=—In the first\r\nmethod the beets are reduced by any good shredding machine, to a fine\r\npulp, which is placed in a press and the juice expressed. In this\r\nliquor, after clarification with lead subacetate, the sucrose is\r\ndetermined by the polariscope. The methods of measuring, clarifying and\r\npolarizing are the same as those described for saccharine juices in\r\nparagraphs =83-85=. The mean percentage of juice in the sugar beet is\r\nninety-five. The corrected polariscopic reading obtained multiplied by\r\n0.95 will give the percentage of sugar in the beet.\r\n\r\n_Example._—The solids in a sample of beet juice, as measured by a brix\r\nspindle, are 17.5 per cent. Double the normal weight of the juice is\r\nmeasured from a sucrose pipette, placed in a sugar flask, clarified,\r\nthe volume completed to 100 cubic centimeters, the contents of the\r\nflask well shaken and filtered. The polariscopic reading obtained is\r\n29°.0. Then (29.0 ÷ 2) × 0.95 = 13.8 = percentage of sucrose in the\r\nbeet.\r\n\r\n=218. Instantaneous Diffusion.=—In the second process employed for\r\ndetermining the sugar content of beets, the principle involved depends\r\non the use of a pulp so finely divided as to permit of the almost\r\ninstant diffusion of the sugar present throughout the added liquid.\r\nThis diffusion takes place even in the cold and the process thus\r\npresents a convenient and rapid method for the accurate determination\r\nof the percentage of sugar in beets. The pulping is accomplished by\r\nmeans of the machine described on page 10, or the one shown in Fig. 67.\r\nThe beet is pressed against the rapidly revolving rasp by means of the\r\ngrooved movable block and the finely divided pulp is received in the\r\nbox below. These machines afford a pulp which is impalpable and which\r\nreadily permits an almost instantaneous diffusion of its sugar content.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 67. APPARATUS FOR PULPING BEETS.]\r\n\r\n=219. Pellet’s Method of Cold Diffusion.=—The impalpable pulp having\r\nbeen obtained, by one of the processes described, the content of sugar\r\ntherein is determined as follows:[181]\r\n\r\nA normal or double normal quantity of the pulp is quickly weighed,\r\nto avoid evaporation, in a sugar dish with an appropriate lip, and\r\nwashed into the flask, which should be graduated, as shown in Fig. 68,\r\nto allow for the volume of the fiber or marc of the beet. Since the\r\nbeet pulp contains, on an average, four per cent of marc, the volume\r\nwhich is occupied thereby is assumed to be a little more than one cubic\r\ncentimeter. Since it is advisable to have as large a volume of water\r\nas convenient, it is the practice of Pellet to wash the pulp into a\r\nflask graduated at 201.35 cubic centimeters. If a 200 cubic centimeter\r\nflask be used, the weight of the pulp should be 25.87 instead of\r\n26.048 grams. After the pulp is washed into the flask, about six cubic\r\ncentimeters of lead subacetate of 30° baumé are added, together with a\r\nlittle ether, to remove the foam. The flask is now gently shaken and\r\nwater added to the mark and the contents thoroughly shaken. If the pulp\r\nis practically perfect, the filtration and polarization may follow\r\nimmediately. The filter into which the contents of the flask are poured\r\nshould be large enough to hold the whole quantity. It is recommended\r\nto add a drop or two of strong acetic acid just before completing\r\nthe volume of the liquid in the flask to the mark. The polarization\r\nshould be made in a 400 millimeter tube, which will give directly the\r\npercentage of sugar present. It is not necessary to heat the solution\r\nin order to insure complete diffusion, but the temperature at which the\r\noperation is conducted should be the ordinary one of the laboratory.\r\nIn case the pulp is not as fine as should be, the flask should be\r\nallowed to stand for half an hour after filling, before filtration.\r\nAn insufficient amount of lead subacetate may permit some rotatory\r\nbodies other than sugar to pass into solution, and care should be\r\ntaken to have always the proper quantity of clarifying material added.\r\nThe presence of these rotating bodies, mostly of a pectic nature,\r\nmay be shown by extracting the pulp first with cold water until all\r\nthe sugar is removed, and afterwards with boiling water. The liquor\r\nobtained from the last precipitation will show a decided right-handed\r\nrotation, unless first treated with lead subacetate, in which case\r\nthe polarization will be zero. A very extended experience with the\r\ninstantaneous cold aqueous diffusion has shown that the results\r\nobtained thereby are quite as reliable as those given by hot alcoholic\r\nor aqueous digestion.\r\n\r\n=220. Flask for Cold Diffusion and Alcohol Digestion.=—For convenience\r\nin washing the pulp into the sugar flask, the latter is made with\r\nan enlarged mouth as shown in Fig. 68. The dish holding the weighed\r\nquantity of pulp is held with the lip in the mouth of the flask, and\r\nthe pulp washed in by means of a jet of water furnished from a pressure\r\nbottle or washing flask. The flask shown is graduated for the normal\r\nweight of pulp, _viz._, 26.048 grams. The marking is on the constricted\r\nneck and extends from 100 to 101.3 cubic centimeters. This permits\r\nof making the proper allowance for the volume occupied by the marc\r\nor fiber, but this is unnecessary for the usual character of control\r\nanalyses. In the case of healthy, fresh beets, the volume occupied\r\nby the marc is nearly one and three-tenths cubic centimeters for the\r\nnormal polariscopic weight of 26.048 grams of pulp. For the laurent\r\ninstrument this volume is nearly one cubic centimeter.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 68. APPARATUS FOR COLD DIFFUSION.]\r\n\r\n=221. Extraction with Alcohol.=—The third method of determining sugar\r\nin beets is by alcoholic extraction. The principle of the method is\r\nbased on the fact that aqueous alcohol of not more than eighty per\r\ncent strength will extract all the sugar from the pulp, but will not\r\ndissolve the pectic and other rotatory bodies, which, in solution,\r\nare capable of disturbing the rotatory power of the sugar present.\r\nIt is also further to be observed that the rotatory power of pure\r\nsucrose, in an aqueous alcoholic solution, is not sensibly different\r\nfrom that which is observed in a purely aqueous liquid. The pulp,\r\nwhich is to be extracted, should be in as fine a state of subdivision\r\nas convenient, and the process may be carried on in any of the forms\r\nof extraction apparatus already described, or in the apparatus shown\r\nin Fig. 69. The extraction tube, of the ordinary forms of apparatus,\r\nhowever, is scarcely large enough to hold the required amount of pulp,\r\nand therefore special tubes and forms of apparatus have been devised\r\nfor this method of procedure. In weighing the pulp for extraction,\r\na quarter, half, or the exact amount required for the polariscope\r\nemployed, should be used. If the tubes are of sufficient size the full\r\nweight may be taken, _viz._, 26.048 or 16.19 grams for the instruments\r\nin ordinary use. Since the pulp contains a large quantity of water,\r\nthe extraction could be commenced with alcohol of standard strength,\r\n_viz._, about ninety-five per cent. The volume of alcohol employed\r\nshould be such as will secure a strength of from seventy to eighty\r\nper cent when mixed with the water contained in the pulp. The flask\r\nreceiving the extract should be kept in continuous ebullition and the\r\nprocess may be regarded as complete in about one hour, when the pulp\r\nhas been properly prepared. The method of extracting beet pulp with\r\nalcohol is due to Scheibler, and in its present form the process is\r\nconducted according to the methods described by Scheibler, Sickel, and\r\nSoxhlet.[182]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 69. SICKEL-SOXHLET EXTRACTOR.]\r\n\r\nIf the pulp be obtained by any other means than that of a fine rasp,\r\nthe extraction of the sugar by the aqueous alcohol takes a long time,\r\nand even a second extraction may be necessary. It is convenient to use\r\nas a flask for holding the solvent, one already graduated at 100 or 110\r\ncubic centimeters. A flask especially constructed for this purpose, has\r\na constricted neck on which the graduations are made, and a wide mouth\r\nserving to attach it to the extracting apparatus, as shown in Fig.\r\n68. When the extract is obtained in this way, it is not necessary to\r\ntransfer it to a new flask before preparing it for polarization. When\r\nthe extraction is complete, the source of heat is removed, and when all\r\nthe alcohol is collected in the flask, the latter is removed from the\r\nextraction apparatus, cooled to room temperature, a sufficient quantity\r\nof lead subacetate added, the flask well shaken, the volume completed\r\nto the mark with water, again well shaken and the contents of the\r\nflask thrown upon the filter. It is important to avoid loss of alcohol\r\nduring filtration. For this purpose it is best to have a folded filter\r\nand to cover the funnel immediately after pouring the contents of the\r\nflask upon the filter paper, with a second larger funnel. The stem of\r\nthe funnel carrying the filter paper, should dip well into the flask\r\nreceiving the filtrate. As in other cases of filtering sugar juices for\r\npolarization, the first portions of the filtrate received should be\r\nrejected. The percentage of sugar is obtained in the filtrate in the\r\nusual way.\r\n\r\nWhere a weight of pulp equal to the normal factor of the polariscope\r\nemployed is used, and the extract collected in a 100 cubic centimeter\r\nflask, the percentage of sugar is directly obtained by making the\r\nreading in a 200 millimeter tube. With other weights of pulp, or other\r\nsizes of flask, the length of the observation tube may be changed or\r\nthe reading obtained corrected by multiplication or division by an\r\nappropriate factor. A battery of sickel-soxhlet extractors is shown in\r\nFig. 69.[183]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 70.]\r\n\r\n=222. Scheibler’s Extraction Tube.=—In order to secure a speedy\r\nextraction of large quantities of pulp, Scheibler recommends the use of\r\nthe extraction tube shown in Fig. 70.[184] The apparatus is composed of\r\nthree concentric glass cylinders. The outer and middle cylinders are\r\nsealed together at the top, and the inner one is movable and carries\r\na perforated diaphragm below, for filtering purposes. Near the top it\r\nis provided with small circular openings, whereby the alcoholic vapors\r\nmay gain access to the condenser (not shown). The middle cylinder is\r\nprovided with two series of apertures, through the higher of which the\r\nvapor of alcohol passes to the condenser, while the alcohol which has\r\npassed through the pulp and collected between the inner and middle\r\ncylinders, flows back through the lower into the flask (not shown)\r\ncontaining the boiling alcohol.\r\n\r\nThe middle cylinder is provided with a curved bottom to prevent the\r\nfiltering end of the inner tube from resting too tightly against it.\r\n\r\nThe tube containing the pulp is thus protected from the direct heat\r\nof the alcoholic vapors during the progress of extraction by a thin\r\ncushion of liquid alcohol.\r\n\r\n=223. Alcoholic Digestion.=—The fourth method of determining sugar in\r\nbeet pulp, is by means of digestion with hot alcohol. The principle\r\nof this method is precisely the same as that which is involved in\r\naqueous diffusion in the cold. The diffusion, however, in the case of\r\nthe alcohol, is not instantaneous, but is secured by maintaining the\r\nmixture of the pulp and alcohol for some time at or near the boiling\r\npoint. The methods of preparing the pulp, weighing it and introducing\r\nit into the digestion flask are precisely those used for aqueous\r\ndigestion, but in the present case a somewhat coarser pulp may be\r\nemployed. The method is commonly known as the rapp-degener process.[185]\r\n\r\nAny convenient method of heating the alcohol may be used. In this\r\nlaboratory the flasks are held on a false bottom in a bath composed of\r\ntwo parts of glycerol and one of water. One side of the bath holder\r\nis made of glass, as shown in Fig. 71, in order to keep the flasks in\r\nview. In order to avoid the loss of alcohol, the digestion flask should\r\nbe provided with a reflux condenser, or be attached to an ordinary\r\ncondenser, which will reduce the vapors of alcohol again to a liquid.\r\nUnless the weather be very warm, the reflux condenser may consist of\r\na glass tube of rather wide bore and at least one meter in length, as\r\nshown in Fig. 71. A slight loss of alcohol during the digestion is of\r\nlittle consequence. A convenient method of procedure is the following.\r\n\r\nDouble the quantity of the beet pulp required for the ventzke\r\npolariscope, _viz._, 52.096 grams, weighed in a lipped metal dish,\r\nis washed, by means of alcohol, into a flask marked at 202.6 cubic\r\ncentimeters, and the flask filled two-thirds with ninety-five per\r\ncent alcohol and well shaken. Afterwards, a proper quantity of lead\r\nsubacetate is added, and then sufficient alcohol to complete the volume\r\nto the mark. The flask is then attached to the condenser, placed in\r\na water-glycerol bath and heated to a temperature of 75° for about\r\nforty-five minutes. At the end of this time, the flask is removed from\r\nthe bath and condenser, cooled quickly with water, alcohol added to\r\nthe mark and well shaken. The filtration should be accomplished with\r\nprecautions, to avoid the loss of alcohol mentioned in paragraph =221=.\r\nThe filtrate is examined in the polariscope in a 200 millimeter tube,\r\nand the reading obtained gives directly the percentage of sugar in the\r\nsample examined. Half the quantity of pulp mentioned, in a 101.3 cubic\r\ncentimeter flask, may also be used. A convenient form of arranging a\r\nbattery of flasks is shown in the accompanying figure.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 71. BATTERY FOR ALCOHOLIC DIGESTION.]\r\n\r\n=224. Determination of Sugar in Mother Beets.=—In selecting mother\r\nbeets for seed production, it is necessary to secure only those of a\r\nhigh sugar content. This is accomplished by boring a hole about two and\r\na half centimeters in diameter obliquely through the beet by means of\r\nthe apparatus shown in Fig. 72.\r\n\r\nThe beet is not injured for seed production by this process, and the\r\npulp obtained is used for the determination of sugar. The juice is\r\nexpressed by means of the small hand press shown in Fig. 73. Since only\r\na small quantity of juice is obtained, it is advisable to prepare it\r\nfor polarization in a sugar flask marked at fifty cubic centimeters.\r\nThe density of the juice, by reason of its small volume, is easiest\r\nobtained by the hydrostatic balance, as described in paragraph =53=.\r\nIn lieu of this, the juice may be quickly weighed in a counterbalanced\r\ndish on a balance giving results accurate to within one milligram. The\r\nrest of the analytical process is similar to that already described.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 72. RASP FOR SAMPLING MOTHER BEETS.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 73. HAND PRESS FOR BEET ANALYSIS.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 74.]\r\n\r\n=225. Aqueous Diffusion.=—The process of instantaneous aqueous\r\ndiffusion may also be applied to the examination of mother beets. For\r\nthis purpose the beets are perforated by a rasp, devised by Keil, shown\r\nlying on the floor in Fig. 72, the characteristics of which are shown\r\nin Fig. 74. The conical end of the rasp is roughened in such a way\r\nas to reduce the beet to an impalpable pulp. This end is fastened by\r\na bayonet fastening to the cylindrical carrier or arm in such a way\r\nthat, by means of a groove in the conical end of the rasp, the pulp is\r\nintroduced into the cylinder. The cylinder is provided with a small\r\npiston by means of which the pulp can be withdrawn when the cylindrical\r\nportion of the rasp is detached from the driving machinery. It is\r\nimportant that the rasp be driven at a high rate of speed, _viz._, from\r\n1500 to 2000 revolutions a minute. The sample of pulp at this rate of\r\nrevolution is taken almost instantly, and with skilled manipulators the\r\nwhole operation of taking a sample, removing the rasp by means of its\r\nbayonet fastenings, withdrawing the sample of pulp and replacing the\r\nrasp ready for another operation does not consume more than from ten\r\nto twenty seconds. From three to four samples may thus be taken in a\r\nminute. The samples of pulp as taken are dropped into numbered dishes\r\ncorresponding to the numbers on the beets. One-quarter of the normal\r\nweight for the polariscope is used for the analysis. The pulp is placed\r\nin a fifty cubic centimeter flask, water and lead subacetate added, the\r\nflask well shaken, filled to the mark with water, again well shaken,\r\nthe contents thrown on the filter, and the filtrate polarized in a 400\r\nmillimeter tube, giving the direct percentage of sugar. For practical\r\npurposes the percentage of marc in the beet may be neglected. If the\r\npolarization take place in a 200 millimeter tube the number obtained\r\nshould be multiplied by two for the content of sugar.\r\n\r\nIn numbering sugar beets which are to be analyzed for seed production,\r\nit is found that a small perforated tin tag bearing a number may be\r\nsafely affixed to the beet by means of a tack. It is not safe to use\r\npaper tags as they may become illegible by becoming wet before the\r\nsorting of the beets is completed. Where from 1000 to 2000 beets\r\nare to be examined in a day, the number of the beets and the dishes\r\ncorresponding thereto must be carefully controlled to avoid confusion\r\nand mistakes.\r\n\r\n=226. Determination of Sugars without Weighing.=—An ingenious device\r\nfor the rapid analysis of mother beets is based upon the use of a\r\nmachine which cuts from the beet a core of given dimensions and this\r\ncore is subsequently reduced to a pulp which is treated with cold water\r\nand polarized in the manner described above. The cutting knives of the\r\nsampler can be adjusted to take a core of any desired size. Since the\r\nbeets used for analysis have essentially the same specific gravity, the\r\ncores thus taken weigh sensibly the same and the whole core is used\r\nfor the analysis, thus doing away with the necessity of weighing. The\r\ncore obtained is reduced to a pulp in a small machine so adjusted as\r\nto permit the whole of the pulp, when prepared, to be washed directly\r\ninto the sugar flask. By the use of this machine a very large number of\r\nanalyses can be made in a single day, and this is highly important in\r\nthe selection of mother beets, for often 50,000 or 100,000 analyses are\r\nto be made in a short time.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 75. TUBE FOR CONTINUOUS OBSERVATION.]\r\n\r\n=227. Continuous Diffusion Tube.=—To avoid the delay occasioned by\r\nfilling and emptying observation tubes in polariscopic work, where\r\nlarge numbers of analyses of canes and beets are to be made, Pellet\r\nhas devised a continuous diffusion tube, by means of which a solution,\r\nwhich has just been observed, is rapidly and completely displaced by a\r\nfresh solution. This tube, improved by Spencer, is shown in Fig. 75.\r\nThe fresh solution is poured in at the funnel, displacing completely\r\nthe old solution which flows out through the tube at the other end.\r\nThe observer watches the field vision and is able to tell when the\r\nold solution is completely displaced by the clearing of the field, at\r\nwhich time the reading of the new solution can be quickly made. When\r\nsolutions are all ready for examination an expert observer can easily\r\nread, by the aid of this device, from four to five of them in a minute.\r\n\r\n=228. Analysis of Sirups and Massecuites.=—The general principles which\r\ncontrol the analysis of sirups and massecuites are the same whether\r\nthese products be derived from canes or beets. In the case of the\r\nproducts of canes, the sirups or massecuites contain chiefly sucrose,\r\ninvert sugar, and other copper reducing bodies, inorganic matters and\r\nwater. In the case of products derived from sugar beets the contents\r\nare chiefly sucrose, inorganic matters, a trace of invert sugar,\r\nraffinose and water. The principles of the determination of these\r\nvarious constituents have already been described.\r\n\r\n=229. Specific Gravity.=—The specific gravity of sirups and molasses\r\ncan be determined by the spindle in the usual way, but in the case of\r\nmolasses which is quite dense, the spindle method is not reliable. It\r\nis better, therefore, both in molasses and massecuites, to determine\r\nthe density by dilution. For this purpose, as described by Spencer,\r\na definite weight of material, from 200 to 250 grams, is dissolved\r\nin water and the volume of the solution completed to half a liter. A\r\nportion of the solution is then placed in a cylinder and the quantity\r\nof total solids contained therein determined in the usual way by a brix\r\nor specific gravity hydrometer. In case 250 grams of the material be\r\nused the calculation of the brix degree for the original material is\r\nconducted according to the following formula:\r\n\r\n          G × _B_ × _V_\r\n    _x_ = -------------.\r\n              _W_\r\n\r\nIn the above formula _x_ is the required brix degree, _V_ the volume\r\nof the solution, _B_ the observed brix degree of the solution, and G\r\nthe corresponding specific gravity obtained from the table on page 73.\r\nWhen only small quantities of the material are at hand the hydrostatic\r\nbalance (=53=) should be employed. For this purpose twenty-five grams\r\nof the material are dissolved in water and the volume of the solution\r\nmade up to 100 cubic centimeters. The sinker of the hydrostatic balance\r\nis placed in the solution and equilibrium secured by placing the\r\nweights upon the arm of the balance in the usual manner. Since the arm\r\nof the balance is graduated to give, by direct reading, the specific\r\ngravity, the density can be obtained at once.\r\n\r\n_Example._—Let the position of the weights or riders upon the balance\r\narm be as follows:\r\n\r\n    (1) at point of suspension of the bob = 1.000\r\n    (3) at mark 7 on beam                 = 0.07\r\n    (4) at mark 9 on beam                 = 0.009\r\n           Specific gravity               = 1.079\r\n\r\nThe nearest brix degree corresponding to this specific gravity (=58=)\r\nis 19. The total weight of the solution is equal to 100 × 1.079,\r\n_viz._, 107.9 grams. Since the solution contains nineteen per cent of\r\nsolid matter as determined by the hydrostatic balance, the total weight\r\nof solid matter therein is 107.9 × 19 ÷ 100 = 20.5 grams. The total per\r\ncent. of solid matter in the original sample is therefore 20.5 ÷ 25 ×\r\n100 = 82 and the specific gravity corresponding thereto (page 74) is\r\n1.42934.\r\n\r\nThe specific gravity of a massecuite may also be determined in\r\npyknometers especially constructed for this purpose.[186]\r\n\r\n=230. Determination Of Water.=—The accurate determination of water\r\nin sirups and massecuites is a matter of considerable difficulty.\r\nThe principles of conducting the process (=26=), applicable also to\r\nthe determination of water in honeys and other viscous liquids, are\r\nas follows: In all cases where invert sugar is present the drying\r\nshould be conducted at a temperature not exceeding 75° or 80°. In\r\ndense molasses and massecuites a weighed quantity should be dissolved\r\nand made up to a definite volume and an aliquot portion taken for\r\nthe determination. In order to secure complete desiccation at a low\r\ntemperature, the drying should be accomplished in partial vacuum (pages\r\n22, 23). The process of desiccation should be conducted in shallow,\r\nflat-bottom dishes which may be conveniently and cheaply made of\r\naluminum and the process is hastened by filling the dish previously\r\nwith thoroughly dried fragments of pumice stone. When the sample does\r\nnot contain any invert sugar the desiccation can be safely accomplished\r\nat the temperature of boiling water. Drying should be continued in all\r\ncases until practically constant weight is obtained.\r\n\r\n=231. Determination Of Ash.=—Ash is an important constituent of the\r\nsirups, molasses, and massecuites from canes and exists in very much\r\nlarger quantities in the same products from beets. The ash may be\r\ndetermined directly by careful incineration, but it is customary to add\r\na few drops of sulfuric acid, sufficient to combine with all the bases\r\npresent and be in slight excess. The presence of sulfuric acid is of\r\nsome advantage in the beginning of the carbonization and renders the\r\nprocess somewhat easier of accomplishment. When sulfuric acid is used,\r\nthe weight of ash obtained must be diminished by one-tenth to allow for\r\nthe increased weight obtained by the conversion of the carbonates into\r\nsulfates. In general, the principles and methods described on pages\r\n36-40 are to be employed.\r\n\r\n=232. Determination of Reducing Sugars in Sirups, Molasses, and\r\nMassecuites.=—The quantity of reducing sugars in the products derived\r\nfrom the sugar beet, as a rule, is insignificant. In the products from\r\nsugar cane there are large quantities of reducing matters which, in\r\ngeneral, are determined by any of the standard methods already given.\r\nIt has been shown by the author[187] that the juices of healthy sugar\r\ncanes contain a small quantity of invert sugar, but this statement has\r\nbeen contradicted by Bloufret.[188] It is certain, however, that the\r\nreducing bodies derived from the products of manufacture of sugar cane\r\nand sorghum deport themselves in a manner somewhat different from pure\r\ninvert sugar. In the absence of definite information in respect of the\r\nconstitution of these bodies, the methods applicable to dextrose and\r\ninvert sugar may be applied.\r\n\r\nSince the paragraphs relating to these processes were printed some\r\nimportant improvements in the preparation of the alkaline copper\r\nsolutions have been made. The copper carbonate solution, as has already\r\nbeen said, is peculiarly suited to the determination of reducing sugars\r\nin the presence of sucrose and the modified forms of this solution,\r\nand the methods of employing them with invert sugar, dextrose,\r\nlevulose, and maltose, are described below.\r\n\r\n=233. Estimation of Minute Quantities of Invert Sugar in Mixtures.=—The\r\nmethod of Hiller and Meissl, paragraph =142=, may be used for the\r\nestimation of small quantities of invert sugar in mixtures. A modified\r\nform of Soldaini’s reagent is, however, to be preferred for this\r\npurpose. Ost has proposed and tested a copper carbonate solution for\r\nthe purpose mentioned which gives reliable results.[189] The solution\r\nhas the following composition:\r\n\r\n    One liter contains   3.6 grams crystallized copper sulfate.\r\n                       250.0   ”   potassium carbonate.\r\n                       100.0   ”   hydrogen potassium sulfate.\r\n\r\nThis reagent undergoes no change when kept for a long while, especially\r\nin large vessels. Even in smaller vessels it can be kept for a year or\r\nmore without undergoing any change.\r\n\r\nThe method of analysis is the same as that described in paragraph\r\n=128=, with the exception that the boiling is continued for only five\r\nminutes instead of ten, and the quantities of the copper and sugar\r\nsolutions used are doubled, being 100 and fifty cubic centimeters\r\nrespectively. In no case must the solution used contain more than\r\nthirty-eight milligrams of invert sugar. The quantity of sucrose in the\r\nmixture is obtained by polarization (=94=).

Soldaini’s Method Adapted to Gravimetric Work.=—By reason of\r\ntheir better keeping qualities and because of their less energetic\r\naction on non-reducing sugars, copper carbonate solutions are to be\r\npreferred to the alkaline copper tartrate solutions for gravimetric\r\ndeterminations of reducing sugars in cane juices and sugar house\r\nproducts, provided the difficulties which attend the manipulation\r\ncan be removed. Ost has succeeded in securing perfectly satisfactory\r\nresults with copper carbonate solution by slightly varying the\r\ncomposition thereof and continuing the boiling, for the reduction of\r\nthe copper, ten minutes.[191] The copper solution is made as follows:\r\n\r\n     17.5 grams crystallized copper sulfate.\r\n    250.0   ”   potassium carbonate.\r\n    100.0   ”       ”     bicarbonate.\r\n\r\nThe above ingredients are dissolved in water and the volume of\r\nthe solution completed to one liter. The object of the potassium\r\nbicarbonate is to secure in the solution an excess of carbon dioxid\r\nand thus prevent the deposition of basic copper carbonate on keeping.\r\nThe manipulation is conducted as follows:\r\n\r\nOne hundred cubic centimeters of the copper solution are mixed with\r\nhalf that quantity of the sugar solution in a large erlenmeyer, which\r\nis placed upon a wire gauze, heated quickly to boiling and kept in\r\nebullition just ten minutes. The sugar solution should contain not\r\nless than eighty nor more than 150 milligrams of the reducing sugar,\r\nand the quantity of the solution representing this should be diluted\r\nto fifty cubic centimeters before mixing with the copper solution.\r\nAfter boiling, the contents of the erlenmeyer are quickly cooled and\r\nfiltered with suction through an asbestos filter and the whole of the\r\ncopper suboxid washed into the filter tube. This precipitated suboxid\r\nis washed once with a little potassium carbonate solution then with hot\r\nwater and finally with alcohol, well dried, heated to redness, and the\r\ncopper oxid obtained reduced to metallic copper in an atmosphere of\r\nhydrogen entirely free of arsenic. From the weight of metallic copper\r\nobtained the quantity of sugar which has been oxidized is calculated\r\nfrom the tables below.\r\n\r\nIt is evident that the process given above may be varied so as to\r\nconform to the practice observed in this laboratory of cooling the\r\nboiling solution sufficiently at once by adding to it an equal volume\r\nof recently boiled, cold water, collecting the precipitated copper\r\nsuboxid in a gooch, and, after washing it, securing solution in nitric\r\nacid and the precipitation of the copper by electrolysis.\r\n\r\n    TABLE SHOWING MILLIGRAMS DEXTROSE,\r\n    LEVULOSE AND INVERT SUGAR OXIDIZED,\r\n      CORRESPONDING TO MILLIGRAMS OF\r\n             COPPER REDUCED.\r\n\r\n    Copper.

Weighing the Copper as Oxid.=—In the usual methods of the\r\ndetermination of reducing bodies, the percentage is calculated either\r\nvolumetrically from the quantity of the sugar solution required to\r\ndecolorize a given volume of the alkaline copper solution, or the\r\nreduced copper suboxid is brought into a metallic state by heating in\r\nan atmosphere of hydrogen or by electrolytic deposition. A quicker\r\nmethod of procedure is found in completing the oxidation of the cupric\r\noxid by heating to low redness in a current of air.[192] For this\r\ndetermination the precipitation of the cuprous oxid and its filtration\r\nare made in the usual manner. The cuprous oxid is collected in a\r\nfiltering tube, made by drawing out to proper dimensions a piece of\r\ncombustion tube, and has a length of about twelve centimeters in all.\r\nThe unchanged part of the tube is about eight centimeters in length\r\nand twelve millimeters in diameter. It is filled by first putting in\r\na plug of glass wool and covering this with an asbestos felt on top\r\nof which another plug of glass wool is placed. After the cuprous oxid\r\nis collected in the tube it is washed with boiling water, alcohol and\r\nether. The rubber tube connecting it with the suction is of sufficient\r\nlength to permit the tube being taken in one hand and brought into\r\na horizontal position over a bunsen. The tube is gradually heated,\r\nrotating it meanwhile, until any residual moisture, alcohol or ether,\r\nis driven off from the filtering material. The layer of glass wool\r\nholding the cuprous oxid is gradually brought into the flame and as\r\nthe oxidation begins the material will be seen to glow. The heating is\r\ncontinued for some time after the glowing has ceased, in all for three\r\nor four minutes, the tube and the copper oxid which it contains being\r\nbrought to a low redness. The current of air passing over the red-hot\r\nmaterial in this time oxidizes it completely. The filtering tube,\r\nbefore use, must be ignited and weighed in exactly the same manner as\r\ndescribed above. The heat is so applied as not to endanger the rubber\r\ntube attached to one end of the filtering tube nor to burn the fingers\r\nof the operator as he turns the tube during the heating. After complete\r\noxidation the tube is cooled in a desiccator and weighed, the increase\r\nof weight giving the copper oxid. For the atomic weights, 63.3 copper\r\nand 15.96 oxygen, one gram of copper oxid is equivalent to 0.79864\r\ngram of copper, and for the weights 63.17 copper and 15.96 oxygen, one\r\ngram of copper oxid equals 0.79831 gram of copper. From the amount of\r\nmetallic copper calculated by one of these factors, the reducing sugar\r\nis determined by the tables already given.\r\n\r\n=236. Estimation of Dry Substance, Polarization and Apparent Purity for\r\nFactory Control.=—For technical purposes the methods of determining\r\nthe above factors, proposed by Weisberg and applicable to concentrated\r\nsirups, massecuites, and molasses, may be used.[193] Five times the half\r\nnormal quantity of the material, _viz._, 65.12 grams, are placed in a\r\nquarter liter flask, dissolved in water and the flask filled to the\r\nmark. In the well shaken mixture, which is allowed to stand long enough\r\nto be free of air, the degree brix is estimated by an accurate spindle.\r\nFor example, in the case of molasses, let the number obtained be 18.8.\r\n\r\nFifty cubic centimeters of the solution are poured into a 100 cubic\r\ncentimeter flask, the proper quantity of lead subacetate added, the\r\nflask filled to the mark with water, its contents filtered, and the\r\nfiltrate polarized in a 200 millimeter tube. Let the number obtained\r\non polarization be 22°.1. This number may be used in two ways. If\r\nit be multiplied by two the polarization of the original sample is\r\nobtained; in this case, _viz._, 44°.2. In the second place, if 44.2 be\r\nmultiplied by 0.26048 and this product divided by the specific gravity\r\ncorresponding to 18°.8. _viz._, 1.078, the quotient 10.68 is secured\r\nrepresenting the polarization or per cent of sugar contained in the\r\nsolution of which the degree brix was 18.8°. From the numbers 18.8 and\r\n10.68 the apparent purity of the solution, 56.8, is calculated, _viz._,\r\n10.68 × 100 ÷ by 18.8. The original product as calculated above gives a\r\npolarization of 44.2 and this number multiplied by 100 and divided by\r\n56.8 gives 77.8, or the apparent percentage of dry matter. The original\r\nsample of molasses, therefore, had the following composition:\r\n\r\n    Degree brix (total solids)   77.8 per cent.\r\n    Sucrose                      44.2    ”\r\n    Solids, not sucrose          33.6    ”\r\n    Apparent purity              56.8    ”\r\n\r\nIt is seen from the above that with a single weighing and a single\r\npolarization, and within from ten to fifteen minutes, all needful\r\ndata in respect of the proper treatment of molasses for the practical\r\ncontrol and direction of a factory can be obtained.\r\n\r\nIn case a laurent polariscope is used, five times the normal weight,\r\n_viz._, eighty-one grams of the raw material are used and the process\r\nconducted as above.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUCROSE, DEXTROSE, INVERT SUGAR, LEVULOSE, MALTOSE, RAFFINOSE, DEXTRIN\r\nAND LACTOSE IN MIXTURES.\r\n\r\n=237. Occurrence.=—Sucrose and invert sugar are found together in many\r\ncommercial products, especially in raw sugars and molasses made from\r\nsugar cane, and in these products sucrose is usually predominant. They\r\nalso form the principal saccharine contents of honey, the invert sugar,\r\nin this case, being the chief ingredient.\r\n\r\nIn commercial grape sugar, made from starch, dextrose is the important\r\nconstituent, while in the hydrolysis of starch by a diastatic ferment,\r\nmaltose is principally produced. In the manufacture of commercial\r\nglucose by the saccharification of starch with sulfuric acid, dextrin,\r\nmaltose, and dextrose are the dominant products, while in the similar\r\nsubstance midzu ame, maltose and dextrose are chiefly found, and only a\r\nsmall quantity of dextrose.[194] In honeys derived from the exudations\r\nof coniferous trees are found also polarizing bodies not enumerated\r\nabove and presumably of a pentose character.[195] In evaporated milks\r\nare usually found large quantities of sucrose in addition to the\r\nnatural sugar therein contained. These mixtures of carbohydrates often\r\npresent problems of great difficulty to the analyst, and the following\r\nparagraphs will be devoted to an elucidation of the best approved\r\nmethods of solving them.\r\n\r\n\r\nOPTICAL METHODS.\r\n\r\n=238. Sucrose and Invert Sugar.=—The chemical methods of procedure to\r\nbe followed in the case of a sample containing both sucrose and invert\r\nsugar have been given in sufficient detail in preceding paragraphs\r\n(=124, 171=). When, however, it is desirable to study further the\r\ncomposition of the mixture, important changes in the method are\r\nrendered imperative. While the estimation of the sucrose and the total\r\ninvert sugar, or the sum of the dextrose and levulose, is easy of\r\naccomplishment the separate determination of the dextrose and levulose\r\nis not so readily secured. In the latter case the total quantity of the\r\ntwo sugars may be determined, and after the destruction or removal of\r\none of them the other be estimated in the usual way; or in the mixture\r\nthe levulose can be determined by the variation in its gyrodynat,\r\ncaused by changes of temperature.\r\n\r\n=239. Optical Neutrality of Invert Sugar.=—The gyrodynat of levulose\r\ndecreases as the temperature rises (=107=) and at or near a temperature\r\nof 87°.2, it becomes equal to that of dextrose, and, therefore, pure\r\ninvert sugar composed of equal molecules of levulose and dextrose is\r\noptically neutral to polarized light at that temperature. On this fact\r\nChandler and Ricketts have based a method of analysis which excludes\r\nany interference in polarization due to invert sugar.[196] To secure\r\nthe polarization at approximately a temperature of 87°, a water-bath\r\nis placed between the nicols of an ordinary polariscope in such a way\r\nas to hold a tubulated observation tube in the optical axis of the\r\ninstrument. The ends of the bath, in the prolongation of this axis, are\r\nprovided with clear glass disks. The space between the cover glasses\r\nof the observation tube and the glass disks of the bath is occupied by\r\nthe water of the bath. When this is kept at a constant temperature it\r\ndoes not interfere with the reading. The observation tube may be of\r\nglass, but preferably is constructed of metal plated with platinum on\r\nthe inside. For the most exact work the length of the observation tube,\r\nat 87°, is determined by measurement or calculation. The bath is heated\r\nwith alcohol lamps or other convenient means. The arrangement of the\r\napparatus is shown in Fig. 75.\r\n\r\nIn a mixture of sucrose and invert sugar any rotation of the plane\r\nof polarized light at 87° is due to the sucrose alone. In a mixture\r\nof dextrose and sucrose the polarization is determined, and, after\r\ninversion, again determined at 87°. The latter number is due to\r\ndextrose alone, and the difference between the two gives the rotation\r\ndue to sucrose.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 75.—CHANDLER AND RICKETTS’ POLARISCOPE.]\r\n\r\n=240. Sucrose and Raffinose.=—In raw sugars made from beet molasses\r\nconsiderable quantities of raffinose are found. The method of inversion\r\nand polarization in such cases is described in paragraph =100=. In\r\nmaking the inversion by the method proposed by Lindet (=95=), and\r\nconducting the polarization on a laurent instrument, a slightly\r\ndifferent formula, given below, is used; _viz._:\r\n\r\n          _C_ - 0.4891_A_\r\n    _S_ = ---------------\r\n              0.810\r\n\r\n               _A_ - _S_\r\n    and  _R_ = ----------,\r\n                  1.54\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nin which the several letters refer to the same factors as are indicated\r\nby them in the formula of Creydt. In the application of the formula\r\njust given the normal weight of the mixed raw sugars used is 16.2\r\ngrams.[197]\r\n\r\n=241. Optical Determination of Levulose.=—The determination of levulose\r\nby optical methods alone is made possible by reason of the fact that\r\nthe gyrodynats of the sugars with which it is associated are not\r\nsensibly affected by changes of temperature. The principle of the\r\nprocess, as developed by the author, rests on the ascertainment of the\r\nchange in the gyrodynat of levulose when its rotation is observed at\r\nwidely separated temperatures.[198] The observation tube employed for\r\nreading at low temperatures is provided with desiccating end tubes,\r\nwhich prevent the deposition of moisture on the cover glasses. The\r\nrelations of this device to the optical parts of the apparatus are\r\nillustrated in Fig. 76.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 76.—APPARATUS FOR POLARIMETRIC OBSERVATIONS AT LOW\r\nTEMPERATURES.]\r\n\r\nThe protecting tubes are made of hard rubber and the desiccation is\r\nsecured by surrounding the space between the rubber and the perforated\r\nmetal axis with fragments of potash or calcium chlorid.\r\n\r\nThe details of the construction are shown in a horizontal section\r\nthrough the center of the observation tube in Fig. 77. In this figure\r\nthe observation tube, made of glass or metal, is represented by _i_,\r\nthe metal jacket, open at the top in the =V= shape as described, by\r\n_k_. The observation tube is closed by the heavy disk _b_ made of\r\nnon-polarizing glass. This disk is pressed against the end of the\r\nobservation tube by the rubber washer _a_, when the drying system about\r\nto be described is screwed on to _k_. The apparatus for keeping the\r\ncover glass dry is contained in the hard rubber tube _m_ and consists\r\nof a perforated cylinder of brass _e_, supported at one end by the\r\nperforated disk _c_ and at the outer ends by the arms _d_. It is closed\r\nby a cover glass of non-polarizing glass _s_ and can be screwed on to\r\nthe system _h_ at _n_. The space _p_ is filled with coarse fragments\r\nof caustic soda, potash, or calcium chlorid by removing the cover\r\nglass _s_. The perforated disk _c_ prevents any of the fragments from\r\nentering the axis of observation. When the cover glass _s_ is replaced,\r\nit just touches the free end of the perforated metal tube preventing\r\nany of the fragments of the drying material from falling into the\r\ncenter at the outer end. When this drying tube is placed in position,\r\nthe contents of the observation tube _i_ can be kept at the temperature\r\nof zero for an indefinite time without the deposition of a particle of\r\nmoisture either upon the glass _b_ or _s_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 77.—CONSTRUCTION OF DESICATING TUBE.]\r\n\r\nFor determining the rotation at a high temperature the apparatus of\r\nChandler and Ricketts (=238=) may be used or the following device:\r\nThe polarizing apparatus shown above, Fig. 76, may be used after the\r\n=V= shape box is removed from the stand, which is so constructed as\r\nto receive a large box covered with asbestos felt an inch thick. The\r\nobservation tube is held within this box in the same way as in the one\r\njust described so that the hot water extends not only the entire length\r\nof the tube but also covers the cover glasses. In both cases the cover\r\nglasses are made of heavier glass and are much larger in diameter than\r\nfound in the ordinary tubes for polariscopes. The protecting cylinders\r\nof hard rubber are not needed at high temperatures but can be left on\r\nwithout detriment.\r\n\r\nThe illustration, Fig. 78, shows the arrangement of the apparatus with\r\na silver tube in position, which can be filled and emptied without\r\nremoving it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 78.—APPARATUS FOR POLARIZING AT HIGH TEMPERATURES.]\r\n\r\nIn practice the water is heated with a jet of steam and an even\r\ntemperature is secured by a mechanical stirrer kept slowly in motion.\r\nWith such a box it is easy to maintain a temperature for several\r\nhours which will not vary more than half a degree. The temperature\r\nfor reading the hot solutions was fixed at 88°, this being nearly the\r\ntemperature at which a mixture of equal molecules of levulose and\r\ndextrose is optically inactive. In every case the sugar solutions were\r\nmade up to the standard volume at the temperatures at which they were\r\nto be read and thus the variations due to expansion or contraction\r\nwere avoided. When solutions are read at a high temperature, they must\r\nbe made with freshly boiled water so as to avoid the evolution of air\r\nbubbles which may otherwise obscure the field of vision.\r\n\r\nBy means of the apparatus described it is easy for the analyst to make\r\na polarimetric reading at any temperature desired. In all cases the\r\nobservation tube should be left at least a half an hour and sometimes\r\nlonger in contact with the temperature control media before the reading\r\nis made.\r\n\r\nThe appearance of the field of vision is usually a pretty fair index\r\nof the point of time at which a constant temperature is established\r\nthroughout all parts of the system. Any variation in temperature\r\nproduces a distortion of the field of vision while a constant fixed\r\ntemperature will disclose the field of vision in its true shape and\r\ndistinctness of outline.\r\n\r\n_Principles of the Calculation._—If 26.048 grams of pure sucrose be\r\ndissolved in water and the volume made 100 cubic centimeters, it will\r\nproduce an angular rotation of 34°.68 when examined in a 200 millimeter\r\ntube with polarized sodium monochromatic light. Upon the cane sugar\r\nscale of an accurately graduated shadow instrument the reading will be\r\n100 divisions corresponding to 100 per cent of pure sucrose.\r\n\r\nIn the complete inversion of the cane sugar the reaction which takes\r\nplace is represented by the following formula:\r\n\r\n                       —          +\r\n    C₁₂H₂₂O₁₁ + H₂0 = C₆H₁₂O₆ + C₆H₁₂O₆.\r\n\r\nThe minus and plus signs indicate that the resulting invert sugar is\r\na mixture of equal parts of levulose (_d_ fructose) and dextrose (_d_\r\nglucose). We are not concerned here with the fact that a complete\r\ninversion of cane sugar is a matter of great difficulty nor with the\r\ndanger which is always experienced of destroying a part of one of the\r\nproducts of inversion. They are matters which may cause a variation\r\nin the analytical data afterward, but do not affect the principles on\r\nwhich the process is based.\r\n\r\nIn the inversion of 26.048 grams of cane sugar there are therefore\r\nproduced 13.71 grams of levulose and 13.71 grams of dextrose or, in\r\nall, 27.42 grams of the mixed sugars.\r\n\r\nThe angular rotation which would be produced by 13.71 grams of\r\ndextrose in a volume of 100 cubic centimeters and through a column 200\r\nmillimeters in length is, with sodium light, 14°.53 equivalent to 41.89\r\ndivisions of the cane sugar scale. The specific rotatory power of a\r\ndextrose solution of the density given is almost exactly 53, and this\r\nnumber is used in the calculations.\r\n\r\nIn a mixture of the two sugars under the conditions mentioned and at a\r\ntemperature of 0° the angular rotation observed is -15°.15 equivalent\r\nto 43.37 divisions of the cane sugar scale.\r\n\r\nThe + rotation due to the dextrose is 14°.53. Therefore the total\r\nnegative rotation due to levulose at 0° is 15°.15 + 14°.53 =\r\n29°.68. Hence the gyrodynat of levulose at 0° and in the degree of\r\nconcentration noted is readily calculated from the formula\r\n\r\n                 29.68 × 100\r\n    [α]°_{D} = - ------------ = -108.24.\r\n                  2 × 13.71\r\n\r\nSince at 88° (_circa_) the mixture of levulose and dextrose is neutral\r\nto polarized light, it follows that at that temperature the specific\r\nrotatory power of levulose is equal to that of dextrose, _viz._, 53°.\r\n\r\n    [α]⁸⁸ °_{D} = - 53°.\r\n\r\nThe total variation in the specific rotatory power of levulose, between\r\nzero and 88°, is 55°.24. The variation for each degree of temperature,\r\ntherefore, of the specific rotatory power of levulose is equal to\r\n55.24 divided by 88, which is equal to 0.628. From these data it is\r\neasy to calculate the specific rotatory power of levulose for any\r\ngiven temperature. For instance, let it be required to determine the\r\ngyrodynat of levulose at a temperature of 20°. It will be found equal\r\nto 108.24 - 0.628 × 20 = 95.68. The required rotatory power is then\r\n[_a_]²⁰ °_{D} = -95°.68.\r\n\r\nIn these calculations the influence of the presence of hydrochloric\r\nacid upon the rotatory power of the levulose is neglected.\r\n\r\nSince the variation in angular rotation in the mixture at different\r\ntemperatures is due almost wholly to the change in this property of the\r\nlevulose it follows that the variation for each degree of temperature\r\nand each per cent of levulose can be calculated. Careful experiments\r\nhave shown that the variation in the rotatory power of levulose between\r\n0° and 88° is represented by a straight line. For 13.71 grams per\r\n100 cubic centimeters the variation for each degree of temperature\r\nis equal to 43.37 ÷ 88 = 0.49 divisions on the cane sugar scale, or\r\n15.15 ÷ 88 = 0°.1722 angular measure. If 13.71 grams of levulose in\r\n100 cubic centimeters produce the deviations mentioned for each degree\r\nof temperature, one gram would give the deviation obtained by the\r\nfollowing calculations:\r\n\r\nFor the cane sugar scale 0.49 ÷ 13.71 = 0°.0357 and for angular\r\nrotation 0.1722 ÷ 13.71 = 0.01256.\r\n\r\nThe above data afford a simple formula for calculating the percentage\r\nof levulose present from the variation observed in polarizing a\r\nsolution containing levulose, provided that the quantity of levulose\r\npresent is approximately fourteen grams per 100 cubic centimeters.\r\n\r\n_Example._—Suppose in a given case the difference of reading between\r\na solution containing an unknown quantity of levulose at 0° and 88°\r\nis equal to thirty divisions of the cane sugar scale. What weight of\r\nlevulose is present? We have already seen that one gram in 100 cubic\r\ncentimeters produces a variation of 0.0357 division for 1°. For 88°\r\nthis would amount to 3.1416 divisions. The total weight of levulose\r\npresent is therefore 30 ÷ 3.1416 = 9.549 grams. In the case given\r\n26.048 grams of honey were taken for the examination. The percentage of\r\nlevulose was therefore 9.549 × 100 ÷ 26.048 = 36.66 per cent.\r\n\r\nIf it be inconvenient to determine the polarimetric observations at\r\ntemperatures so widely separated as 0° and 88° the interval may be\r\nmade less. In the above case if the readings had been made at 20° and\r\n70° the total variation would have been only ⁵⁰/⁸⁸ of the one given,\r\n_viz._, 17.05 divisions of the cane sugar scale. The calculation would\r\nthen have proceeded as follows:\r\n\r\n0.0357 × 50 = 1.785.\r\n\r\nThen, 17.05 ÷ 1.785 = 9.552 grams of levulose, from which the actual\r\npercentage of levulose can be calculated as above.\r\n\r\nWith honeys the operation is to be conducted as follows:\r\n\r\nSince honeys contain approximately twenty per cent of water and in the\r\ndry substance have approximately forty-five per cent of levulose, about\r\n38.50 grams of the honey should be taken to get approximately 13.8\r\ngrams of levulose.\r\n\r\nIn the actual determination the calculations may be based on\r\nthe factors above noted, but without respect to the degree of\r\nconcentration. If half the quantity of dextrose noted be present its\r\nspecific rotatory power is only reduced to about 52°.75, and this will\r\nmake but little difference in the results. In the case of honey 13.024\r\ngrams of the sample are conveniently used in the examination, half the\r\nnormal weight for the ventzke sugar scale. The error, however, due to\r\ndifference in concentration is quite compensated for by the ease of\r\nclarification and manipulation. Alumina cream alone is used in the\r\nclarification, thus avoiding the danger of heating the solution to a\r\nhigh temperature in the presence of an excess of lead acetate.\r\n\r\nAn interesting fact is observed in cooling solutions of honey to\r\n0°. The maximum left hand rotation is not reached as soon as the\r\ntemperature reaches 0° but only after it has been kept at that\r\ntemperature for two or three hours. The line representing the change in\r\nrotatory power in solutions of honey between 10° and 88° is practically\r\nstraight but from 10° to 0°, if measured by the readings taken without\r\ndelay, it is decidedly curved; the reading being less at first than\r\nit is afterwards. After three hours the 0° becomes sensibly constant\r\nand then the whole line is nearly straight, but still with a slight\r\ndeficiency in the reading at the 0°. For this reason the computations\r\nshould be based on readings between 10° and 88° rather than on a\r\nnumber covering the whole range of temperature. Nevertheless, if the\r\nsolution be kept at 10° for three hours before the final reading is\r\ntaken, no error of any practical magnitude is introduced.\r\n\r\nThe calculations given above, for the cane sugar scale, can also be\r\nmade in an exactly similar manner for angular rotation. The angular\r\nvariation produced by one gram of levulose for 1° of temperature\r\nis 0°.01256. For 88° this would become 1°.10528. Suppose the total\r\nobserved angular deviation in a given case between 0° and 88° to be\r\n10°.404, then the weight of levulose present is 10.404 ÷ 1.10528 =\r\n9.413 grams.\r\n\r\nIn the case mentioned 26.048 grams of honey were taken for the\r\nexamination. The percentage of levulose present, therefore, was 9.413 ×\r\n100 ÷ 26.048 = 36.13.\r\n\r\n=241. General Formula for the Calculation of Percentage of\r\nLevulose.=—Let _K_ = deviation in divisions of the cane sugar scale or\r\nin angular rotation produced by one gram of levulose for 1° temperature.\r\n\r\nLet _T_ and _tʹ_ = temperatures at which observations are made.\r\n\r\nLet _R_ = observed deviation in rotation.\r\n\r\nLet _W_ = weight of levulose obtained.\r\n\r\nLet _L_ = per cent of levulose required.\r\n\r\n                      _R_\r\n    Then  _L_ = --------------- ÷ _W_.\r\n                _K_(_T_ - _tʹ_)\r\n\r\nIn most genuine honeys the value of _R_ between 0° and 88° is\r\napproximately thirty divisions of the cane sugar scale or 10° angular\r\nmeasure for 26.048 grams in 100 cubic centimeters, read in a 200\r\nmillimeter tube, or, for 13.024 grams in 100 cubic centimeters read in\r\na 400 millimeter tube.\r\n\r\nThe method of analysis outlined above has been applied in the\r\nexamination of a large number of honeys with most satisfactory results.\r\nIt can also be applied with equal facility to other substances\r\ncontaining levulose.\r\n\r\n=242. Sucrose and Dextrose.=—In mixtures these two sugars are easily\r\ndetermined by optical processes, provided no other bodies sensibly\r\naffecting the plane of polarized light be present. The total deviation\r\ndue to both sugars is determined in the usual way. The percentage\r\nof sucrose is afterwards found by the inversion method (=92=). The\r\nrotation, in the first instance due to the sucrose, is calculated from\r\nthe amount of this body found by inversion, and the residual rotation\r\nis caused by the dextrose. The percentage of dextrose is easily\r\ncalculated by a simple proportion into which the numbers expressing the\r\ngyrodynats of sucrose and dextrose enter. When the readings are made on\r\na ventzke scale the calculations are made as follows:\r\n\r\n    Weight of sample used          26.048 grams.\r\n    First polarization             88°.5\r\n    Polarization after inversion   10°.5\r\n    Temperature                    20°.0\r\n    Percentage of sucrose           58.4\r\n    Rotation due to dextrose       30°.1\r\n\r\nPercentage of dextrose:\r\n\r\n    66.5 : 53 = _x_ : 30.1; whence _x_ = 37.8.\r\n\r\nThe sample examined therefore contains 58.4 per cent of sucrose and\r\n37.8 per cent of dextrose.\r\n\r\nIt is evident that the method just described is also applicable when\r\nmaltose, dextrin, or any other sugar or polarizing body, not sensibly\r\naffected by the process of inversion to which the sucrose is subjected,\r\nis substituted for dextrose. When, however, more than two optically\r\nactive bodies are present the purely polariscopic process is not\r\napplicable. In such cases the chemical or the combined chemical and\r\noptical methods described further on can be employed.\r\n\r\n=243. Lactose in Milk.=—By reason of its definite gyrodynat lactose\r\nin milk is quickly and accurately determined by optical methods, when\r\nproper clarifying reagents are used to free the fluid of fat and\r\nnitrogenous substances. Soluble albuminoids have definite levogyratory\r\npowers and, if not entirely removed, serve to diminish the rotation due\r\nto the lactose.\r\n\r\nMilk casein precipitated by magnesium sulfate has the following\r\ngyrodynatic numbers assigned to it:[199]\r\n\r\n    Dissolved in water [_a_]_{D} = -80°\r\n        ”     ”  very dilute solution [_a_]_{D} = -87°.\r\n        ”     ”  dilute sodium hydroxid solution [_a_]_{D} = -76°.\r\n        ”     ”  strong potassium hydroxid solution [_a_]_{D} = -91°.\r\n\r\nThe hydrates of albumen have rotation powers which vary from [_a_]_{D}\r\n= -71°.40 to [_a_]_{D} = -79°-05. From the chaotic state of knowledge\r\nconcerning the specific rotating power of the various albumens, it is\r\nimpossible to assign any number which will bear the test of criticism.\r\nFor the present, however, this number may be fixed at [_a_]_{D} = -70°\r\nfor the albumens which remain in solution in the liquids polarized for\r\nmilk sugar.[200]\r\n\r\nMany reagents have been prepared for the removal of the disturbing\r\nbodies from milk in order to make its polarization possible. Among\r\nthe precipitants which have been used in this laboratory may be\r\nmentioned:[201]\r\n\r\n(1) Saturated solution basic lead acetate, specific gravity 1.97:\r\n\r\n(2) Nitric acid solution of mercuric nitrate diluted with an equal\r\nvolume of water: (=88.=)\r\n\r\n(3) Acetic acid, specific gravity 1.040, containing twenty-nine per\r\ncent acetic acid:\r\n\r\n(4) Nitric acid, specific gravity 1.197, containing thirty per cent\r\nnitric acid:\r\n\r\n(5) Sulfuric acid, specific gravity 1.255, containing thirty-one per\r\ncent sulfuric acid:\r\n\r\n(6) Saturated solution of sodium chlorid:\r\n\r\n(7) Saturated solution of magnesium sulfate:\r\n\r\n(8) Solution of mercuric iodid in acetic acid, formula; potassium\r\niodid, 33.2 grams; mercuric chlorid, 13.5 grams; strong acetic acid,\r\n20.0 cubic centimeters; water 640 cubic centimeters.\r\n\r\nAlcohol, ether, and many solutions of mineral salts, hydrochloric and\r\nother acids are also used as precipitants for albumen, but none of them\r\npresents any advantages.\r\n\r\nExperience has shown that the best results in polariscopic work are\r\nsecured by the use of either the mercuric iodid or the acid mercuric\r\nnitrate for clarifying the milk. The latter reagent should be used\r\nin quantities of about three cubic centimeters for each 100 of milk.\r\nIt is evident when it is desired to determine the residual nitrogen\r\nin solution, the former reagent must be employed. The quantity of\r\nalbuminoid matter left in solution after clarification with mercurial\r\nsalts is so minute as to exert no sensible effect on the rotation of\r\nthe plane of polarized light produced by the lactose.\r\n\r\nFor purposes of calculation the gyrodynat of lactose in the ordinary\r\nconditions of temperature and concentration may be represented by\r\n[_a_]_{D} = 52°.5 (=107=).\r\n\r\n_Polarization._—The proper weight of milk is placed in a sugar flask,\r\ndiluted with water, clarified with the mercuric salt, the volume\r\ncompleted to the mark, and the contents shaken and poured on a filter.\r\nThe filtrate is polarized in tubes of convenient length. The observed\r\nrotation may be expressed either in degrees of angular measurement or\r\nof the sugar scale. The weight of milk used may be two or three times\r\nthat of the normal weight calculated for the instrument employed.\r\nInstead of weighing the milk a corresponding volume determined by its\r\nspecific gravity may be delivered from a burette-pipette (p. 231).\r\nFor the laurent polariscope three times, and for the half-shadow\r\ninstruments for lamplight, twice the normal weight of milk should be\r\nused. For approximately sixty cubic centimeters of milk the flask\r\nshould be marked at 105 cubic centimeters in compensation for the\r\nvolume of precipitated solids or the reading obtained from a 100 cubic\r\ncentimeter flask, decreased by one-twentieth.\r\n\r\nFor the laurent instrument the normal weight of lactose is determined\r\nby the following proportions:\r\n\r\nGyrodynat of sucrose, 66.5: lactose: 52.5 = _x_: 16.19.\r\n\r\nWhence _x_ = 20.51, that is, the number of grams of pure lactose in 100\r\ncubic centimeters required to read 100 divisions of the sugar scale of\r\nthe instrument.\r\n\r\nFor the ventzke scale the normal quantity of lactose required to read\r\n100 divisions is found from the following equation:\r\n\r\n66.4: 52.5 = _x_: 26.048\r\n\r\nWhence _x_ = 32.74.\r\n\r\nIn the one case three times the normal weight of milk is 61.53 and in\r\nthe other twice the normal weight, 65.48 grams.\r\n\r\n=244. Error due to Volume of Precipitate.=—Vieth states that the\r\nvolume allowed for the precipitated solids in the original process,\r\n_viz._, two and four-tenths cubic centimeters, is not sufficiently\r\nlarge.[202] In such cases it is quite difficult to decide on any\r\narbitrary correction based on the supposed quantities of fat and\r\nalbuminoids present. A better method than to try to compensate for\r\nany arbitrary volume is to remove entirely the disturbing cause or\r\neliminate it by indirect means. To wash the precipitate free of sugar\r\nwithout increasing the bulk of the filtrate unduly would be extremely\r\ndifficult and tend, moreover, to bring some of the precipitated matters\r\nagain into solution. It is better, therefore, to eliminate the error by\r\ndouble dilution and polarization (=86=). The principle of this method\r\nis based on the fact, that, within limits not sensibly affecting the\r\ngyrodynat by reason of different densities, the polarizations of two\r\nsolutions of the same substance are inversely proportional to their\r\nvolumes.\r\n\r\nFor convenience, it is recommended that the volumes of the samples in\r\neach instance be 100 and 200 cubic centimeters, respectively, in which\r\ncase the true reading is obtained by the simple formula given in the\r\nlatter part of =86=.\r\n\r\nIn this laboratory the double dilution method of determining the volume\r\nof the precipitate is conducted as follows:[203]\r\n\r\nIn each of two flasks marked at 100 and 200 cubic centimeters,\r\nrespectively, are placed 65.52 grams of milk, four cubic centimeters\r\nof mercuric nitrate added, the volume completed to the mark and the\r\ncontents of the flask well shaken.\r\n\r\nAfter filtering, the polarization is made in a 400 millimeter tube\r\nby means of the triple shadow polariscope described in =75=. From\r\nthe reading thus obtained the volume of the precipitate and the\r\ndegree of correction to be applied are calculated as in the subjoined\r\nexample. The flasks should be filled at near the temperature at which\r\nthe polarizations are made and the observation room must be kept at\r\npractically a constant temperature of 20° to avoid the complications\r\nwhich would be produced by changes in the gyrodynat of lactose and\r\nthe value of the quartz plates and wedges of the apparatus by marked\r\nvariations in temperature.\r\n\r\n_Example._—Weight of milk used in each case 65.52 grams.\r\n\r\n    Polarimetric reading from the 100 cubic centimeter flask, 20°.84\r\n         ”          ”     ”    ”  200   ”       ”        ”    10°.15\r\n    Then      10.15 × 2 = 20.30\r\n              20.84 - 20.30 = 0.54\r\n              0.54 × 2 = 1.08\r\n              20.84 - 1.08 = 19.76\r\n              19.76 ÷ 4 = 4.94,\r\n\r\nwhich is the corrected reading showing the percentage of lactose in the\r\nsample used.\r\n\r\nThe volume of the precipitate is calculated as follows:\r\n\r\n20.84 ÷ 4 = 5.21, the apparent percentage of lactose present.\r\n\r\nThen 5.21: 4.94 = 100: _x_.\r\n\r\nWhence _x_ = 94.82. From this number it is seen that the true volume of\r\nthe milk solution polarized is 94.82 instead of 100 cubic centimeters,\r\nwhence the volume occupied by the precipitate is 100 - 94.82 = 5.18\r\ncubic centimeters. So little time is required to conduct the analysis\r\nby the double dilution method as to render it preferable in all cases\r\nwhere incontestable data are desired. Where arbitrary corrections are\r\nmade the volume allowed for the precipitate may vary from two and a\r\nhalf cubic centimeters in milks poor in fat, to six for those with a\r\nhigh cream content.\r\n\r\nFor milks of average composition sufficient accuracy is secured by\r\nmaking an arbitrary correction of five cubic centimeters for the volume\r\nof the precipitate.\r\n\r\n\r\nSEPARATION OF SUGARS BY CHEMICAL AND CHEMICAL-OPTICAL METHODS.\r\n\r\n=245. Conditions of Separation.=—In the foregoing paragraphs the\r\noptical methods for determining certain sugars have been described.\r\nMany cases arise, however, in which these processes are inapplicable or\r\ninsufficient. In these instances, the analyst, as a rule, will be able\r\nto solve the problem presented by the purely chemical methods which\r\nhave been previously described, or by a combination of the chemical\r\nand optical processes. Not only have the different sugars distinctive\r\nrelations to polarized light, but also they are oxidized by varying\r\nquantities of metallic salts and these differences are sufficiently\r\npronounced to secure in nearly every instance, no matter how complex,\r\ndata of a high degree of accuracy.\r\n\r\nThe carbohydrates of chief importance, from an agricultural point of\r\nview, are starch and sucrose; while the alternation products of chief\r\nimportance, derived therefrom by chemical and biological means, are\r\ndextrin, maltose, dextrose and invert sugar.\r\n\r\n=246. Sucrose, Levulose, and Dextrose.=—The purely chemical methods of\r\nseparating these three sugars have been investigated by Wiechmann.[204]\r\nThey are based on the data obtained by determining the percentage of\r\nreducing sugars, both before and after the inversion of the sucrose,\r\nand before and after the removal of the levulose. For the destruction\r\nof the levulose, the method of Sieben is employed, and attention is\r\ncalled to the fact that the complete removal of the levulose by this\r\nprocess is difficult of accomplishment, and is probably attended with\r\nalterations of the other sugars present.\r\n\r\n=247. Sieben’s Method of Determining Levulose.=—The decomposing action\r\nof hot hydrochloric acid on levulose, and its comparative inaction on\r\ndextrose are the basis of Sieben’s process.[205] The hydrochloric acid\r\nemployed should contain about 220 grams of the pure gas per liter, that\r\nis, be of twenty-two per cent strength, corresponding to 1.108 specific\r\ngravity. If the substance acted on be invert sugar, its solution should\r\nbe approximately of two and a half per cent strength. To 100 cubic\r\ncentimeters of such a solution, sixty of the hydrochloric acid are\r\nadded, and the mixture immersed in boiling water for three hours.\r\n\r\nAfter quickly cooling, the acid is neutralized with sodium hydrate of\r\nthirty-six times normal strength. Ten cubic centimeters of the hydrate\r\nsolution will thus neutralize the sixty of hydrochloric acid which have\r\nbeen used to destroy the levulose. The work of Wiechmann discloses the\r\nfact, easily prevised, that the method used for destroying levulose is\r\nnot always effective and that action of the reagent is not exclusively\r\nconfined to the levogyrate constituent of the mixture. Nevertheless,\r\ndata of reasonable accuracy may be secured by this process, which is\r\nbest carried out as described by Wiechmann. In this connection the\r\npossibility of the polymerization of the dextrose molecules, when\r\nheated with hydrochloric acid, must not be overlooked.\r\n\r\n=248. The Analytical Process.=—The total quantity of invert sugar in a\r\ngiven solution is determined by the methods already given (=136, 141=.)\r\n\r\nAfter this has been accomplished, the levulose is destroyed as\r\ndescribed above, and the dextrose determined by any approved method\r\n(=136, 140=). In the presence of sucrose, the sum of the reducing\r\nsugars is first determined as in =136, 142=. After the inversion of\r\nthe sucrose, the invert sugar is again determined, and the increased\r\nquantity found, calculated to sucrose. The levulose is then destroyed\r\nby hydrochloric acid, and the dextrose determined as described above.\r\nThe quantity of sucrose may also be determined by an optical method\r\n(=91, 92, 94=.).\r\n\r\n=249. Calculation of Results.=—If we represent by a the weight of\r\nmetallic copper reduced by the invert sugar present in a solution\r\ncontaining sucrose, and by _b_ that obtained after the inversion of\r\nthe sucrose, the quantity of copper corresponding to the sucrose is _b\r\n- a_ = _c_. After the destruction of the levulose, the copper reduced\r\nby the residual dextrose may be represented by _d_. The weight of\r\ncopper equivalent to the levulose is, therefore, _b - d_ = _e_. From\r\nthe tables already given, the corresponding quantities of the sugars\r\nequivalent to _c, d_, and _e_ are directly taken. Example:\r\n\r\n                           { 163.8  milligrams invert sugar.\r\n    _a_ = 300 milligrams = { 156.5       ”     dextrose.\r\n                           { 185.63      ”     levulose.\r\n\r\n    _b_ = 500     ”\r\n\r\n    _d_ = 275     ”      =  142.8        ”     dextrose.\r\n\r\n    _c_ = 200     ”      =  106.3        ”     invert sugar.\r\n\r\n    _e_ = 225     ”      =  133.89       ”     levulose.\r\n\r\nThe 106.3 milligrams of invert sugar equivalent to _c_, correspond to\r\n101 milligrams of sucrose. The quantity of dextrose equivalent to 275\r\nmilligrams of copper is 142.8. Of this amount 53.15 milligrams are\r\ndue to the inverted sucrose, leaving 89.65 milligrams arising from\r\nthe invert sugar and dextrose originally present. This quantity is\r\nequivalent to 175 milligrams of copper.\r\n\r\nOf the 300 milligrams of copper obtained in the first instance, 125\r\nare due to levulose in the original sample, corresponding to 69.73\r\nmilligrams which number, multiplied by two, gives the invert sugar\r\npresent.\r\n\r\nThe sample examined, therefore, had the following composition:\r\n\r\n    Sucrose        101.00 milligrams.\r\n    Invert sugar   139.46     ”\r\n    Dextrose        19.92     ”\r\n                   ------\r\n         Sum       260.38     ”\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, if the invert sugar be calculated from the quantity\r\ncorresponding to the 225 milligrams of copper corresponding to _e_, the\r\ndata will be very different from those given above. In this instance of\r\nthe levulose found corresponding to 225 milligrams of copper, _viz._,\r\n133.89, 53.15 milligrams are due to the inverted sucrose. Then the\r\nquantity due to the invert sugar at first present is 133.89 - 53.15 =\r\n80.74 milligrams. Since half the weight of invert sugar is levulose,\r\nthe total weight of the invert sugar at first present is 161.48,\r\nleaving only 8.91 milligrams due to added dextrose. The difficulties in\r\nthese calculations doubtless arise from the imperfect destruction of\r\nthe levulose, and from variations in the reducing action of sugars on\r\ncopper salts in the presence of such large quantities of sodium chlorid.\r\n\r\n=250. Calculation from Data obtained with Copper Carbonate.=—The\r\nwide variations observed in different methods of calculations in the\r\npreceding paragraph, are due in part to the different degrees of\r\noxidation exerted on alkaline copper tartrate by the dextrose and\r\nlevulose. Better results are obtained by conducting the analytical work\r\nwith Ost’s modification of Soldaini’s solution (=128=).\r\n\r\nThe relative quantities of levulose and dextrose oxidized by this\r\nsolution are almost identical, and the calculations, therefore, result\r\nin nearly the same data, whether made from the numbers obtained with\r\nthe residual dextrose or from the levulose destroyed. The method of\r\napplying this method is illustrated in the following calculation.\r\n\r\n_Example._—In a mixture of sucrose, invert sugar, and dextrose, the\r\nquantities of copper obtained by using the copper carbonate solution\r\nwere as follows:\r\n\r\n    Copper obtained before inversion       = _a_ =       150 milligrams.\r\n       ”      ”     after     ”            = _b_ =       250     ”\r\n       ”      ”       ” destroying lev’e   = _d_ =       137.5   ”\r\n       ”  equivalent to inverted sucrose   = _b_ - _a_ = _c_ = 100     ”\r\n       ”      ”      ”  levulose           = _b_ - _d_ = _e_ = 112.5   ”\r\n\r\n                                      {44.0 milligrams invert sugar.\r\n    _a_ = 150    milligrams Cu = {45.3      ”   dextrose.\r\n                                      {42.5      ”   levulose.\r\n    _d_ = 137.5       ”      ” =  41.55     ”   dextrose.\r\n    _c_ = 100         ”      ” =  29.5      ”   invert sugar = 28.025\r\n                                                            sucrose.\r\n    _e_ = 112.5       ”      ” =  31.9      ”   levulose.\r\n\r\n    14.75 milligrams of dextrose = 48.5 milligrams Cu.\r\n    14.75   ”         ” levulose = 51.5      ”      ”\r\n\r\n    137.5 - 48.5 = 89.0 milligrams Cu due to dextrose present before\r\n                        inversion.\r\n           89.0 milligrams Cu = 27 milligrams dextrose before inversion.\r\n   150.0 - 89.0       ”     ” = 61.0  ”   Cu due to levulose present\r\n                                          before inversion.\r\n            61.0       ”     ” = 17.8  ”   levulose before inversion.\r\n    17.8 × 2    = 35.6 milligrams invert sugar present before inversion.\r\n    27.0 - 17.8 =  9.2   ”        dextrose        ”       ”       ”\r\n\r\nAgain:\r\n\r\n    112.5 - 51.5 = 61.0 milligrams Cu due to levulose present\r\n                        before inversion.\r\n    61.0 milligrams Cu = 17.8 milligrams levulose.\r\n    17.8      ”   levulose indicate 35.6 milligrams invert sugar.\r\n    Dextrose in invert sugar before inversion = 17.8 milligrams.\r\n    Total dextrose before inversion = 27.0 milligrams.\r\n    Dextrose above amount required for invert sugar = 27.0 - 17.8\r\n                                                    = 9.2 milligrams.\r\n\r\nThe respective quantities of the three sugars in the solution are,\r\ntherefore:\r\n\r\n    Sucrose      = 28.025 milligrams.\r\n    Invert sugar = 35.6        ”\r\n    Dextrose     =  9.2        ”\r\n\r\nThe calculations made from the later data (=234=) give almost the same\r\nresults.\r\n\r\n=251. Winter’s Process.=—Winter has proposed a method of separating\r\ndextrose and levulose in the presence of sucrose based on the\r\nselective precipitation produced on treating mixtures of these sugars\r\nin solution with ammoniacal lead acetate.[206]\r\n\r\nThe reagent is prepared immediately before use by adding ammonia to\r\na solution of lead acetate until the opalescence which is at first\r\nproduced just disappears. The separation is based on the fact that\r\nthe compound of sucrose with the reagent is easily soluble in water,\r\nwhile the salts formed with levulose and dextrose are insoluble. The\r\nseparation of the sugars is accomplished as follows:\r\n\r\nThe ammoniacal lead acetate is added to the solution of the mixed\r\nsugars until no further precipitate is produced. The precipitated\r\nmatters are digested with a large excess of water and finally separated\r\nby filtration. The sucrose is found in the filtrate in the form of a\r\nsoluble lead compound, from which it is liberated by treatment with\r\ncarbon dioxid. The lead carbonate produced is separated by filtration\r\nand the sucrose is estimated in an aliquot part of the filtrate by\r\noptical or chemical methods. The precipitate containing the lead\r\ncompounds of dextrose and levulose is washed free of sucrose, suspended\r\nin water and saturated with carbon dioxid. By this treatment the lead\r\ncompound with dextrose is decomposed and, on filtration, the dextrose\r\nwill be found in the filtrate, while the lead compound of the levulose\r\nis retained upon the filter with the lead carbonate. After well washing\r\nthe precipitate, it is again suspended in water and saturated with\r\nhydrogen sulfid. By this treatment the lead levulosate compound is\r\nbroken up and the levulose obtained, on subsequent filtration, in\r\nthe filtrate. The dextrose and levulose, after separation as above\r\ndescribed, may be determined in aliquot parts of their respective\r\nfiltrates by the usual gravimetric methods. Before determining the\r\nlevulose the solution should be heated until all excess of hydrogen\r\nsulfid is expelled.\r\n\r\nThis method was used especially by Winter in separating the various\r\nsugars obtained in the juices of sugar cane. It has not been largely\r\nadopted as a laboratory method, and on account of the time and trouble\r\nrequired for its conduct, is not likely to assume any very great\r\npractical importance.\r\n\r\n=252. Separation of Sugars by Lead Oxid.=—In addition to the\r\ncombination with the earthy bases, sugar forms well defined compounds\r\nwith lead oxid. One of these compounds is of such a nature as to have\r\nconsiderable analytical and technical value. Its composition and the\r\nmethod of preparing it have been pointed out by Kassner.[207]\r\n\r\nSucrose, under conditions to be described, forms with the lead oxid\r\na diplumbic saccharate, which separates in spheroidal crystals, and\r\nhas the composition corresponding to the formula C₁₂H₁₈O₁₁Pb₂ + 5H₂O.\r\nThe precipitation takes place quantitively and should be conducted as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\nThe substance containing the sucrose, which may be molasses, sirups\r\nor concentrated juices, is diluted with enough water to make a sirup\r\nwhich is not too viscous. Lead oxid suspended in water is stirred into\r\nthe mass in such proportion as to give about two parts of oxid to one\r\nof the sugar. The stirring is continued for some time until the oxid\r\nis thoroughly distributed throughout the mass and until it becomes\r\nthick by the commencement of the formation of the saccharate. As soon\r\nas the mass is sufficiently thickened to prevent the remaining lead\r\noxid from settling, the stirring may be discontinued and the mixture\r\nis left for twenty-four hours, at the end of which time the sucrose\r\nhas all crystallized in the form of lead saccharate. The crystals of\r\nlead saccharate can be separated by a centrifugal machine or by passing\r\nthrough a filter press, and are thoroughly washed with cold water, in\r\nwhich they are almost insoluble. The washed crystals are beaten up with\r\nwater into a thick paste and the lead separated as basic carbonate by\r\ncarbon dioxid. The sucrose is found in solution in the residual liquor\r\nand is concentrated and crystallized in the usual way.\r\n\r\nReducing sugars have a stronger affinity for the lead oxid than the\r\nsucrose, and this fact is made use of to effect a nearly complete\r\nseparation when they are mixed together. In order to secure this the\r\nlead oxid is added in the first place only in sufficient quantity to\r\ncombine with the reducing sugars present, the process being essentially\r\nthat described above. The reducing sugars which are precipitated as\r\nlead dextrosates, lead levulosates, etc., are separated in the usual\r\nway by a centrifugal or a filter press, and the resulting liquor,\r\nwhich contains still nearly all the sucrose, is subjected to a second\r\nprecipitation by the addition of lead oxid. The second precipitation\r\nobtained is almost pure diplumbic saccharate.\r\n\r\nIn the precipitation of the sugar which is contained in the beet\r\nmolasses, where only a trace or very little invert sugar is present,\r\nthe sucrose is almost quantitively separated, and by the concentration\r\nof the residual liquor, potash salts are easily obtained. In this case,\r\nafter the decomposition of the lead saccharate by carbon dioxid, the\r\nresidual sugar solution is found entirely free of lead. Where invert\r\nsugar is present, however, in any considerable proportions, it is found\r\nto exercise a slightly soluble influence on the lead saccharate, and\r\nin this case a trace of lead may pass into solution. For technical\r\npurposes, this is afterwards separated by hydrosulfuric acid or the\r\nintroduction of lime sulfid.\r\n\r\nLead oxid is regenerated from the basic lead carbonate obtained by\r\nheating in retorts to a little above 260°, and the carbon dioxid\r\nevolved can also be used again in the technical process.\r\n\r\n=253. Commercial Glucose and Grape Sugar.=—The commercial products\r\nobtained by the hydrolysis of starch are known in the trade as glucose\r\nor grape sugar. The former term is applied to the thick sirup obtained\r\nby concentrating the products of a partial hydrolysis, while the latter\r\nis applied to the solid semi-crystalline mass, secured by continuing\r\nthe hydrolyzing action until the intermediate products are almost\r\ncompletely changed to dextrose. In this country the starch employed\r\nis obtained almost exclusively from maize, and the hydrolyzing agent\r\nused is sulfuric acid.[208] The products of conversion in glucose are\r\nchiefly dextrins and dextrose with some maltose, and in grape sugar\r\nalmost entirely dextrose. When diastase is substituted for an acid, as\r\nthe hydrolytic agent, maltose is the chief product, the ferment having\r\nno power of producing dextrose. In the glucose of Japan, known as midzu\r\name dextrin and maltose are the chief constituents.[209]\r\n\r\nCommercial glucose is used chiefly by confectioners for manufacturing\r\ntable sirups and for adulterating honey and molasses.\r\n\r\nCommercial grape sugar is chiefly employed by brewers as a substitute\r\nfor barley and other grains.\r\n\r\nIn Europe, the starch which is converted into glucose, is derived\r\nprincipally from potatoes. The method employed in conversion, whether\r\nan acid or diastatic action, is revealed not only by the nature of\r\nthe product, but also by the composition of its ash. In the case of\r\ndiastatic conversion the ash of the sample will contain only a trace of\r\nsulfates, no chlorin, and be strongly alkaline, while the product of\r\nconversion with sulfuric acid will give an ash rich in sulfates with a\r\nlittle lime and be less strongly alkaline.\r\n\r\nThe process of manufacture in this country consists in treating the\r\nstarch, beaten to a cream with water, with sulfuric acid, usually under\r\npressure, until the product shows no blue color with iodin. The excess\r\nof acid is removed with marble dust, the sirup separated by filtration,\r\nwhitened by bleaching with sulfurous acid or by passing it through\r\nbone-black and evaporated to the proper consistence in a vacuum. The\r\nsolid sugar, consisting mostly of dextrose, is made in the same manner,\r\nsave that the heating with the acid is continued until the dextrin and\r\nmaltose are changed into maltose. The product is either obtained in\r\nits ordinary hydrated form or by a special method of crystallization\r\nsecured as bright anhydrous crystals. Solutions of dextrose, when first\r\nmade, show birotation, but attain their normal gyrodynatic state on\r\nstanding for twenty-four hours in the cold, or immediately on boiling.\r\n\r\n=254. Methods Of Separation.=—The accurate determination of the\r\nquantities of the several optically active bodies formed in commercial\r\nglucose is not possible by any of the methods now known. Approximately\r\naccurate data may be secured by a large number of processes, and these\r\nare based chiefly on the ascertainment of the rotation and reducing\r\npower of the mixed sugars, the subsequent removal of the dextrose and\r\nmaltose by fermentation or oxidation and the final polarization of the\r\nresidue. The difficulties which attend these processes are alike in\r\nall cases. Fermentation may not entirely remove the reducing sugars or\r\nmay act slightly on the dextrin. In like manner the oxidation of these\r\nsugars by metallic salts may not entirely decompose them, may leave an\r\noptically active residue, or may affect the optical activity of the\r\nresidual dextrin. The quantitive methods of separating these sugars\r\nby means of phenylhydrazin, lead salts or earthy bases have not been\r\ndeveloped into reliable and applicable laboratory processes. At the\r\npresent time the analyst must be contented with processes confessedly\r\nimperfect, but which, with proper precautions, yield data which are\r\nnearly correct. The leading methods depending on fermentation and\r\noxidation combined with polarimetric observations will be described in\r\nthe subjoined paragraphs.\r\n\r\n=255. Fermentation Method.=—This process is based on the assumption\r\nthat, under certain conditions, dextrose and maltose may be removed\r\nfrom a solution and the dextrin be left unchanged. In practice,\r\napproximately accurate results are obtained by this method, although\r\nthe assumed conditions are not strictly realized. In the prosecution\r\nof this method the polarimetric reading of the mixed sugars is made,\r\nand the maltose and dextrose removed therefrom by fermentation\r\nwith compressed yeast. The residual dextrins are determined by the\r\npolariscope on the assumption that their average gyrodynat is 193.\r\nIn the calculation of the quantities of dextrose and maltose their\r\ngyrodynats are fixed at 53 and 138 respectively. The total quantity\r\nof reducing sugar is determined by the usual processes. The relative\r\nreducing powers of dextrose and maltose are represented by 100 and 62\r\nrespectively. The calculations are made by the following formulas:[210]\r\n\r\n    _R_  = reducing sugars as dextrose\r\n    _d_  = dextrose\r\n    _m_  = maltose\r\n    _dʹ_ = dextrin\r\n    _P_  = total polarization\r\n                  (calculated as apparent gyrodynat)\r\n    _Pʹ_ = rotation after fermentation\r\n                  (calculated as apparent gyrodynat).\r\n\r\n    Whence _R_ = _d_ + 0.62_m_              (1)\r\n           _P_ = 53_d_ + 138_m_ + 163_dʹ_   (2)\r\n           _Pʹ_ = 193_dʹ_                   (3)\r\n\r\nFrom these three equations the values of _d_, _m_, and _dʹ_ are readily\r\ncalculated:\r\n\r\n    _Example_: To find _d_ and _m_:\r\n\r\n    Subtract (3) from (2) _P_  = 53_d_ + 133_m_ + 193_dʹ_\r\n                          _Pʹ_ =                  193_dʹ_\r\n                          --------------------------------------\r\n                          _P_ - _Pʹ_ = 53_d_ + 138_m_ (4)\r\n\r\n    Multiply (1) by 53 and subtract from (4)\r\n\r\n              _P_ - _Pʹ_ = 53_d_ + 138_m_\r\n                  53_R_  = 53_d_ +  32.86_m_\r\n              -------------------------------------------\r\n              _P_ - _Pʹ_ - 53_R_ = 105.14_m_    (5)\r\n\r\n                          _P_ - _Pʹ_ - 53_R_\r\n             Whence _m_ = ------------------    (6)\r\n                                105.14\r\n\r\n                  _d_ = _R_ - 0.62_m_           (7)\r\n\r\n                        _Pʹ_\r\n                 _dʹ_ = ----                     (8)\r\n                         193\r\n\r\nSidersky assigns the values [_a_]_{D} = 138.3 and [_a_]_{D} = 194.8 to\r\nmaltose and dextrin respectively in the above formulas.[211]\r\n\r\n_Illustration_: In the examination of a sample 26.048 grams of midzu\r\name in 100 cubic centimeters were polarized in a 200 millimeter tube\r\nand the following data were obtained:\r\n\r\nPolarization of sample in angular degrees 69°.06, which is equal to an\r\napparent gyrodynat of 132.6:\r\n\r\nTotal reducing sugar as dextrose 33.33 per cent:\r\n\r\nPolarization in angular degrees after fermentation 30°.84 = [_a_]_{D} =\r\n59.2.\r\n\r\nSubstituting these values in the several equations gives the following\r\nnumbers:\r\n\r\n    (1)  0.3333 = _d_ + 0.62_m_\r\n    (2)   132.6 = 53_d_ + 138_m_ + 193_dʹ_\r\n    (3)    59.2 = 193_dʹ_\r\n    (4)    73.4 = 53_d_ + 138_m_\r\n    (5)   55.74 = 105.14_m_\r\n    (6)     _m_ = 0.5301 = 53.01 per cent.\r\n    (7)     _d_ = 3333 - 3286 = 0.0047 =  00.47 per cent.\r\n    (8)    _dʹ_ = 59.2 ÷ 193 = 0.3067 = 30.67  ”   ”\r\n\r\n_Summary_: Sample of midzu ame:\r\n\r\n    Percentage of dextrin               30.67 per cent.\r\n        ”      ”  maltose               53.01  ”   ”\r\n        ”      ”  dextrose              00.47  ”   ”\r\n        ”      ”  water                 14.61  ”   ”\r\n        ”      ”  ash                   00.31  ”   ”\r\n                                        -----\r\n                          Sum           99.07  ”   ”\r\n                          Undetermined   0.93  ”   ”\r\n\r\nFor polarization the lamplight shadow polariscope employed for sugar\r\nmay be used, and the degrees of the sugar (ventzke) scale converted\r\ninto angular degrees by multiplying by 0.3467.\r\n\r\nThe process of fermentation is conducted as described in the paragraph\r\ngiven further on, relating to the determination of lactose in the\r\npresence of sucrose.\r\n\r\n=256. The Oxidation Method.=—The removal of the reducing sugars may\r\nbe accomplished by oxidation instead of fermentation. The process\r\nof analysis is in all respects similar to that described in the\r\nforegoing paragraph, substituting oxidation for fermentation.[212]\r\nFor the oxidizing agent mercuric cyanid is preferred, and it is\r\nconveniently prepared by dissolving 120 grams of mercuric cyanid and\r\nan equal quantity of sodium hydroxid in water mixing the solutions\r\nand completing the volume to one liter. If a precipitate be formed\r\nin mixing the solutions it should be removed by filtering through\r\nasbestos. For the polarization, ten grams of the sugars in 100 cubic\r\ncentimeters is a convenient quantity. Ten cubic centimeters of\r\nthis solution are placed in a flask of water marked at fifty cubic\r\ncentimeters, a sufficient quantity of the mercuric cyanid added to\r\nremain in slight excess after the oxidation is finished (from twenty to\r\ntwenty-five cubic centimeters) and the mixture heated to the boiling\r\npoint for three minutes. The alkali, after cooling, is neutralized with\r\nstrong hydrochloric acid and the passing from alkalinity to acidity\r\nwill be indicated by a discharge of the brown color which is produced\r\nby heating with the alkaline mercuric cyanid. The heating with the\r\nmercury salt should be conducted in a well ventilated fume chamber.\r\n\r\nThe calculation of the results is conducted by means of the formulas\r\ngiven in the preceding paragraph. In the original paper describing\r\nthis method, it was stated that its accuracy depended on the complete\r\noxidation of the reducing sugar in a manner leaving no optically active\r\nproducts, and on the inactivity of the reagents used in respect to the\r\ndextrin present. These two conditions are not rigidly fulfilled, as is\r\nshown by Wilson.[213] According to his data maltose leaves an optically\r\nactive residue, which gives a somewhat greater right hand rotation than\r\nis compensated for by the diminished rotation of the dextrin. Wilson,\r\nhowever, confesses that the dextrin used contained reducing sugars,\r\nwhich would not be the case had it been prepared by the process of\r\ntreating it with alkaline mercuric cyanid as above indicated. Upon the\r\nwhole, the oxidation of the reducing sugar by a mercury salt gives\r\nresults which, while not strictly accurate, are probably as reliable as\r\nthose afforded by fermentation. The author has attempted to supplant\r\nboth the oxidation and fermentation methods by removing the reducing\r\nsugars with a precipitating reagent, such as phenylhydrazin, but the\r\nmethods are not sufficiently developed for publication.\r\n\r\n=257. Removal of Dextrose by Copper Acetate.=—Maercker first called\r\nattention to the fact that Barfoed’s reagent (one part copper acetate\r\nin fifteen parts of water, and 200 cubic centimeters of this solution\r\nmixed with five cubic centimeters of thirty-eight per cent. acetic\r\nacid) reacts readily with dextrose, while it is indifferent to maltose\r\nand dextrins. Sieben’s method of removing dextrose is based on this\r\nfact.[214] It is found that under certain conditions pure maltose\r\ndoes not reduce either the acidified or neutral solution of copper\r\nacetate, while dextrose or a mixture of dextrose and maltose does so\r\nreadily. It is also shown that the fermentation residue under suitable\r\nconditions acts like maltose. Maltose solutions reduce the reagent\r\nafter boiling four minutes while at 40°-45° they have no effect even\r\nafter standing four days. The amount of copper deposited by dextrose,\r\nunder the latter conditions, is found to depend to a certain extent on\r\nthe amount of free acetic acid present, and as the solutions of copper\r\nacetate always contain varying quantities of acetic acid which cannot\r\nbe removed without decomposition and precipitation of basic salt, the\r\nuse of an absolutely neutral solution is impracticable. The reagent\r\nprepared according to Barfoed’s directions is almost saturated, but a\r\nhalf normal solution is preferable. Sieben proposes two solutions: I,\r\ncontaining 15.86 grams copper and 0.56 gram acetic anhydrid per liter;\r\nII, containing 15.86 grams copper and three grams acetic anhydrid per\r\nliter. The reduction of the dextrose is secured by placing 100 cubic\r\ncentimeters of the solution in a bottle, adding the sugar solution,\r\nstoppering and keeping in a water-bath at 40°-45° two or three days. An\r\naliquot portion is then drawn off and the residual copper precipitated\r\nby boiling with forty-five cubic centimeters of the alkali solution\r\nof the fehling reagent and forty cubic centimeters of one per cent\r\ndextrose solution, filtered and weighed as usual. The results show that\r\neither solution can be used, and that standing for two days at 45°\r\nis sufficient. One hundred cubic centimeters of the copper solution\r\nare mixed with ten cubic centimeters of the sugar solution containing\r\nfrom two-tenths to five-tenths gram of dextrose, as this dilution\r\ngives the best results. No reduction is found to have taken place when\r\nsolutions containing five-tenths gram maltose or five-tenths gram\r\nfermentation residue are used. The data can not be compiled in the\r\nform of a table similar to Allihn’s, as it is impossible to obtain a\r\nsolution of uniform acidity each time, and the solution will have to be\r\nstandardized by means of a known pure dextrose solution and the result\r\nobtained with the unknown sugar solution properly diluted compared with\r\nthis. This method of Sieben’s has never been practiced to any extent in\r\nanalytical separations and can not, therefore, be strongly recommended\r\nwithout additional experience.\r\n\r\n=258. Removal of Dextrin by Alcohol.=—By reason of its less solubility,\r\ndextrin can be removed from a solution containing also dextrose and\r\nmaltose by precipitation with alcohol. It is impracticable, however, to\r\nsecure always that degree of alcoholic concentration which will cause\r\nthe coagulation of all the dextrins without attacking the concomitant\r\nreducing sugars. In this laboratory it has been found impossible to\r\nprepare a dextrin by alcoholic precipitation, which did not contain\r\nbodies capable of oxidizing alkaline copper solutions.\r\n\r\nThe solution containing the dextrin is brought to a sirupy consistence\r\nby evaporation and treated with about ten volumes of ninety per cent\r\nalcohol. After thorough mixing, the precipitated dextrin is collected\r\non a filter and well washed with alcohol of the strength noted. It is\r\nthen dried and weighed. If weaker solutions of dextrin are used, the\r\nalcohol must be of correspondingly greater strength. In the filtrate\r\nthe residual maltose and dextrose may be separated and determined by\r\nthe chemical and optical methods already described.\r\n\r\n\r\nCARBOHYDRATES IN MILK.\r\n\r\n=259. The Copper Tartrate Method.=—The lactose in milk is readily\r\nestimated by the gravimetric copper method described in paragraph\r\n=143=. Before the application of the process the casein and fat of\r\nthe milk should be removed by an appropriate precipitant, and an\r\naliquot part of the filtrate, diluted to contain about one per cent\r\nof milk sugar, used for the determination. The clarification is very\r\nconveniently secured by copper sulfate or acetic acid, as described\r\nin the next paragraph. A proper correction should be made for the\r\nvolume occupied by the precipitate and, for general purposes, with\r\nwhole milk of fair quality this volume may be assumed to be five per\r\ncent. One hundred grams of milk will give a precipitate occupying\r\napproximately five cubic centimeters. In the analytical process, to\r\ntwenty cubic centimeters of milk, diluted with water to eighty, is\r\nadded a ten per cent solution of acetic acid, until a clear whey is\r\nshown after standing a few minutes, when the volume is completed to 100\r\ncubic centimeters with water, and the whole, after thorough shaking,\r\nthrown on a filter. An aliquot part of the filtrate is neutralized with\r\nsodium carbonate and used for the lactose determination. This solution\r\ncontains approximately one per cent of lactose. In a convenient part\r\nof it the lactose is determined and the quantity calculated for the\r\nwhole. This quantity represents the total lactose in the twenty\r\ncubic centimeters of milk used. The weight of the milk is found by\r\nmultiplying twenty by its specific gravity. From this number the\r\npercentage of lactose is easily found. In this process the milk is\r\nclarified by the removal of its casein and fat. Other albuminoids\r\nremain in solution and while these doubtless disturb the subsequent\r\ndetermination of lactose, any attempt at their removal would be equally\r\nas disadvantageous. The volume of the precipitate formed by good, whole\r\nmilk when the process is conducted as above described, is about one\r\ncubic centimeter, for which a corresponding correction is readily made.\r\n\r\n=260. The Official Method.=—The alkaline copper method of determining\r\nlactose, adopted by the Association of Official Agricultural Chemists,\r\nis essentially the procedure proposed by Soxhlet.[215]\r\n\r\nDilute twenty-five cubic centimeters of the milk, held in a half\r\nliter flask, with 400 cubic centimeters of water and add ten cubic\r\ncentimeters of a solution of copper sulfate of the strength given for\r\nSoxhlet’s modification of Fehling’s solution, page 129; add about seven\r\nand a half cubic centimeters of a solution of potassium hydroxid of\r\nsuch strength that one volume of it is just sufficient to completely\r\nprecipitate the copper as hydroxid from one volume of the solution of\r\ncopper sulfate. In place of a solution of potassium hydroxid of this\r\nstrength eight and a half cubic centimeters of a half normal solution\r\nof sodium hydroxid may be used. After the addition of the alkali\r\nsolution the mixture must still have an acid reaction and contain\r\ncopper in solution. Fill the flask to the mark, shake and filter\r\nthrough a dry filter.\r\n\r\nPlace fifty cubic centimeters of the mixed copper reagent in a beaker\r\nand heat to the boiling point. While boiling briskly, add 100 cubic\r\ncentimeters of the lactose solution, prepared as directed above, and\r\nboil for six minutes. Filter immediately and determine the amount of\r\ncopper reduced by one of the methods already given, pages 149-155.\r\nObtain the weight of lactose equivalent to the weight of copper found\r\nfrom the table on page 163.\r\n\r\n=261. The Copper Cyanid Process.=—It has been found by Blyth that the\r\ncopper cyanid process of Gerrard gives practically the same results\r\nin the determination of sugar in milk as are obtained by optical\r\nmethods.[216] The milk for this purpose is clarified, by precipitating\r\nthe casein with acetic acid in the following manner:\r\n\r\nTwenty-five cubic centimeters of milk are diluted with an equal\r\nvolume of distilled water, and strong acetic acid added until the\r\ncasein begins to separate. The liquid is heated to boiling and, while\r\nhot, centrifugated in any convenient machine. The supernatant liquid\r\nobtained is separated by filtration and the solid matter thrown upon\r\nthe filter and well washed with hot water. The filtrate and washings\r\nare cooled and completed to a volume of 100 cubic centimeters. This\r\nliquid is of about the proper dilution for use with the copper cyanid\r\nreagent. The percentage of sugar determined by this reagent agrees well\r\nwith that obtained by the optical method, when no other sugars than\r\nlactose are present. If there be a notable difference in the results\r\nof the two methods other sugars must be looked for. The presence\r\nof dextrin may be determined by testing a few drops of the clear\r\nliquor with iodin, which, in the presence of dextrin, gives a reddish\r\ncolor. Other sugars are determined by obtaining their osazones. For\r\nthis purpose the filtrate obtained as above should be concentrated\r\nuntil the volume is about thirty cubic centimeters. Any solid matter\r\nwhich separates during the evaporation is removed by filtration. The\r\nosazones are precipitated in the manner described in paragraph =147=.\r\nOn cooling, the almost solid crystalline mass obtained is placed on\r\na filter, washed with a little cold water, the crystals then pressed\r\nbetween blotting paper and dried at a temperature of 100°. The dry\r\nosazones obtained are dissolved in boiling absolute alcohol, of which\r\njust sufficient is used to obtain complete solution. The alcoholic\r\nsolution is set aside for twelve hours and the separation of a\r\ncrystalline product after that time shows that dextrose or invert sugar\r\nis present. Milk sugar alone gives no precipitate but only a slight\r\namorphous deposit. The lactosazone is precipitated by adding a little\r\nwater to the hot alcoholic solution and the crystals thus obtained\r\nshould be dissolved in boiling absolute alcohol and reprecipitated by\r\nthe addition of water at least three times in order to secure them\r\npure. The osazones are identified by their melting points, paragraph\r\n=172=. The first part of this method does not appear to have any\r\nadvantage over the optical process by double dilution (p. 278), and\r\nrequires more time.\r\n\r\n=262. Sugars in Evaporated Milks.=—In addition to the lactose normally\r\npresent in evaporated milks the analyst will, in most cases, find large\r\nquantities of sucrose. The latter sugar is added as a preservative and\r\ncondiment. By reason of the ease with which sucrose is hydrolyzed,\r\nevaporated milk containing it may have also some invert sugar among\r\nits contents. A method of examination is desirable, therefore, which\r\nwill secure the determination of lactose, sucrose and invert sugar\r\nin mixtures. The probability of the development of galactose and\r\ndextrose during the evaporation and conservation of the sample, is not\r\ngreat. The best method of conducting this work is the one developed by\r\nBigelow and McElroy.[217] The principle on which the method is based\r\nrests on the fact that in certain conditions, easily supplied, the\r\nsucrose and invert sugar present in a sample may be entirely removed\r\nby fermentation and the residual lactose secured in an unchanged\r\ncondition. The lactose is finally estimated by one of the methods\r\nalready described.\r\n\r\nThe details of the process follow:\r\n\r\nOn opening a package of evaporated milk, its entire contents are\r\ntransferred to a dish and well mixed. Several portions of about\r\ntwenty-five grams each are placed in flasks marked at 100 cubic\r\ncentimeters. To each of the flasks enough water is added to bring\r\nall the sugars into solution and normal rotation is made certain by\r\nboiling. After cooling, the contents of the flasks are clarified by\r\nmercuric iodid in acetic acid solution. The clarifying reagent is\r\nprepared by dissolving fifty-three grams of potassium iodid, twenty-two\r\ngrams of mercuric chlorid, and thirty-two cubic centimeters of\r\nstrongest acetic acid in water, mixing the solutions and completing the\r\nvolume to one liter. The clarification is aided by the use of alumina\r\ncream (=84=). The flask is filled to the mark, and the contents well\r\nshaken and poured on a filter. After rejecting the first portion of\r\nthe filtrate the residue is polarized in the usual manner. Two or more\r\nseparate portions of the sample are dissolved in water in flasks of the\r\nsize mentioned, heated to 55°, half a cake of compressed yeast added\r\nto each and the temperature kept at 55° for five hours. The residue in\r\neach flask is treated as above described, the mercuric solution being\r\nadded before cooling to prevent the fermentative action of the yeast,\r\nand the polarization noted.\r\n\r\nBy this treatment the sucrose is completely inverted, while the\r\nlactose is not affected. The percentage of sucrose is calculated by\r\nthe formulas given in paragraph =94=, using the factor 142.6. At the\r\ntemperature noted the yeast exercises no fermentative, but only a\r\ndiastatic action.\r\n\r\nIn each case the volume of the precipitated milk solids is determined\r\nby the double dilution method, and the proper correction made (p. 278).\r\nThe lactose remaining is determined by chemical or optical methods,\r\nbut it is necessary, in all cases where invert sugar is supposed to be\r\npresent, to determine the total reducing sugars in the original sample\r\nas lactose. If the quantity thus determined and the amount of sucrose\r\nfound as above are sufficient to produce the rotation observed in the\r\nfirst polarization, it is evident that no invert sugar is present. When\r\nthe polarization observed is less than is equivalent to the quantity\r\nof sugar found, invert sugar is present, which tends to diminish the\r\nrotation produced by the other sugars. In this case it is necessary to\r\nremove both the sucrose and invert sugar by a process of fermentation,\r\nwhich will leave the lactose unchanged.\r\n\r\nThis is accomplished by conducting the fermentation in the presence\r\nof potassium fluorid, which prevents the development of the lactic\r\nferments. For this purpose 350 grams of the evaporated milk are\r\ndissolved in water and the solution boiled to secure the normal\r\nrotation of the lactose. After cooling to 80°, the casein is thrown\r\ndown by adding a solution containing about four grams of glacial\r\nphosphoric acid and keeping the temperature at 80° for about fifteen\r\nminutes. After cooling to room temperature, the volume is completed\r\nto one liter with water, well shaken and poured onto a filter. An\r\naliquot part of the filtrate is nearly neutralized with a noted volume\r\nof potassium hydroxid. Enough water is added to make up, with the\r\nvolume of potassium hydroxid used, the total space occupied by the\r\nprecipitated solid, corresponding to that part of the filtrate, and if\r\nnecessary, refilter. The volume occupied by the precipitated solids is\r\neasily determined by polarization and double dilution. The filtrate,\r\nobtained from the process described above, is placed in portions of\r\n100 cubic centimeters each in 200 cubic centimeter flasks with about\r\ntwenty milligrams of potassium fluorid in solution, and half a cake of\r\ncompressed yeast. The yeast is broken up and evenly distributed, and\r\nthe fermentation is allowed to proceed for ten days at a temperature\r\nof from 25° to 30°. At the end of this time experience has shown that\r\nall of the sucrose and invert sugar has disappeared, but the lactose\r\nremains intact. The flasks are filled to the mark with water and the\r\nlactose determined by chemical or optical methods. By comparing the\r\ndata obtained from the estimation of the total reducing sugars before\r\nfermentation or inversion and the estimation of the lactose after\r\nfermentation, the quantity of invert sugar is easily calculated. The\r\nexperience of this laboratory shows that invert sugar is rarely present\r\nin evaporated milks, which is an indication that the sucrose added\r\nthereto does not generally suffer hydrolysis. The mean percentage of\r\nadded sucrose found in evaporated milks is about forty.\r\n\r\n\r\nSEPARATION AND DETERMINATION OF STARCH.\r\n\r\n=263. Occurrence.=—Many bodies containing starch are presented for\r\nthe consideration of the agricultural analyst. First in importance\r\nare the cereals, closely followed by the starchy root crops. Many\r\nspices and other condiments also contain starchy matters. In the\r\nsap of some plants, for instance sorghum, at certain seasons,\r\nconsiderable quantities of starch occur. In the analysis of cereals\r\nand other feeding stuffs, it has been the usual custom to make no\r\nseparate determination of starch, but to put together all soluble\r\ncarbohydrates and estimate their percentage by subtracting from 100\r\nthe sum of the percentages of the other constituents of the sample.\r\nThis aggregated mass has been known as nitrogen-free extract. Recent\r\nadvances in methods of investigation render it advisable to determine\r\nthe starch and pentosan carbohydrates separately and to leave among\r\nthe undetermined bodies the other unclassed substances, chiefly of a\r\ncarbohydrate nature, soluble in boiling dilute acid and alkali.\r\n\r\n=264. Separation of Starch.=—Starch being insoluble in its natural\r\nstate, it is impossible to separate it from the other insoluble matters\r\nof plants by any known process. In bringing it into solution it\r\nundergoes certain changes of an unknown nature, but tending to produce\r\na dextrinoid body. Nevertheless, in order to procure the starch in a\r\nstate of purity suited to analytical processes, it becomes necessary\r\nto dissolve the starch from the other insoluble bodies that naturally\r\naccompany it. As has been shown in preceding paragraphs, there are only\r\ntwo methods of securing the solution of starch which fully meet the\r\nconditions of accurate analysis. These are the methods depending on the\r\nuse of diastatic ferments and on the employment of heat and pressure\r\nin the presence of water. These two processes have been described\r\nin considerable detail in paragraphs =179-181=. It is important, in\r\nstarch determinations, to remove from the sample the sugar and other\r\nsubstances soluble in water and also the oils, when present in large\r\nquantities, before subjecting it to the processes for rendering the\r\nstarch soluble.\r\n\r\n=265. Desiccation of Amyliferous Bodies.=—The removal of sugars and\r\noils is best secured in amyliferous substances after they are deprived\r\nof their moisture. As has already been suggested, the desiccation\r\nshould be commenced at a low temperature, not above 60°, and continued\r\nat that point until the chief part of the water has escaped. The\r\noperation may be conducted in one of the ways already described\r\n(pp. 12-27). There is great difference of opinion among analysts in\r\nrespect of the degree of temperature to which the sample should be\r\nfinally subjected, but for the purposes here in view, it will not be\r\nfound necessary to go above 105°. Before beginning the operation the\r\nsample should be as finely divided as possible, and at its end the\r\ndried residue should be ground and passed through a sieve of half a\r\nmillimeter mesh.\r\n\r\n=266. Indirect Method of Determining: Water in Starch.=—It is claimed\r\nby Block[218] that it is necessary to dry starch at 160° in order to get\r\ncomplete dehydration. Wet starch as deposited with its maximum content\r\nof water has nine molecules thereof, _viz._, C₆H₁₀O₅ + 9H₂O. Ordinary\r\ncommercial starch has about eighteen per cent of water with a formula\r\nof C₆H₁₀O₅ + 2H₂O.\r\n\r\nThe percentage of water may be determined by Block’s feculometer or\r\nBlock’s dose-fécule. The first apparatus determines the percentage of\r\nanhydrous starch by volume, and the second by weight.\r\n\r\nBlock’s assumption that starch can absorb only fifty per cent of its\r\nweight of water is the basis of the determination.\r\n\r\nA noted weight of starch is rubbed up with water until saturated, the\r\nwater poured off, the starch weighed, dried on blotting paper until it\r\ngives off no more moisture and again weighed. Half of the lost weight\r\nis water, from which the original per cent of water can be calculated.\r\nThis at best seems to be a rough approximation and not suited to\r\nrigorous scientific determination.\r\n\r\n=267. Removal of Oil and Sugar.=—The dried, finely powdered sample,\r\nobtained as described above, is placed in any convenient extractor\r\n(=33-43=) and the oil or fat it contains removed by the usual solvents.\r\nFor ordinary purposes, even with cereals, this preliminary extraction\r\nof the oil is not necessary, but it becomes so with oily seeds\r\ncontaining starch. The sugar is subsequently removed by extraction\r\nwith eighty per cent alcohol and the residue is then ready for the\r\nextraction of the starch. In most cases the extraction with alcohol\r\nwill be found sufficient. In some bodies, for instance the sweet potato\r\n(batata), the quantity of sugar present is quite large, and generally\r\nsome of it is found. If not present in appreciable amount, the alcohol\r\nextraction may also be omitted. The sample having been prepared as\r\nindicated, the starch may be brought into solution by one of the\r\nmethods described in paragraphs =179-181=, preference being given to\r\nthe aqueous digestion in an autoclave. The dissolved starch is washed\r\nout of the insoluble residue and determined by optical or chemical\r\nmethods =186-194=.\r\n\r\n=268. Preparation of Diastase for Starch Solution.=—The methods of\r\npreparing malt extract for use in starch analysis have been described\r\nin paragraph =179=. If a purer form of diastase is desired it may be\r\nprepared by following the directions given by Long and Baker.[219]\r\nDigest 200 grams of ground malt for twenty-four hours with three parts\r\nof twenty per cent alcohol. Separate the extract by filtration and\r\nto the filtrate add about one and a half liters of ninety-three per\r\ncent alcohol and stir vigorously. After the precipitate has subsided\r\nthe supernatant alcohol is removed by a syphon, the precipitate is\r\nbrought onto a filter and washed with alcohol of a strength gradually\r\nincreasing to anhydrous, and finally with anhydrous ether. The diastase\r\nis dried in a vacuum over sulfuric acid and finally reduced to a fine\r\npowder before using. Thus prepared, it varies in appearance from a\r\nwhite to a slightly brownish powder. Made at different times and from\r\nseparate portions of malt, it may show great differences in hydrolytic\r\npower.\r\n\r\n=269. Estimation of Starch in Potatoes by Specific Gravity.=—A roughly\r\napproximate determination of the quantity of starch in potatoes can be\r\nmade by determining their specific gravity. Since the specific gravity\r\nof pure starch is 1.65, it follows that the richer a potato is in\r\nstarch the higher will be its specific gravity. The specific weight\r\nof substances like potatoes is conveniently determined by suspending\r\nthem in water by a fine thread attached to the upper hook of a balance\r\npan. There may be a variation of the percentage of other constituents\r\nin potatoes as well as of starch, and therefore the data obtained from\r\nthe following table can only be correct on the assumption that the\r\nstarch is the only variable. In practice, errors amounting to as much\r\nas two per cent may be easily made, and therefore the method is useful\r\nonly for agronomic and commercial and not for scientific purposes. The\r\nmethod is especially useful in the selection of potatoes of high starch\r\ncontent for planting. The table is constructed on the weight in grams\r\nin pure water of 10000 grams of potatoes and the corresponding per\r\ncents of dry matter and starch are given. It is not always convenient\r\nto use exactly 10000 grams of potatoes for the determination, but the\r\ncalculation for any given weight is easy.[220]\r\n\r\n_Example._—Let the weight of a potato in air be 159 grams, and its\r\nweight in water 14.8 grams.\r\n\r\nThen the weight of 10000 grams of potatoes of like nature in water\r\nwould be found from the equation 159: 10000 = 14.8: _x_.\r\n\r\nWhence _x_ = 931 nearly.\r\n\r\nIn the table the nearest figure to 931 is 930, corresponding to 24.6\r\nper cent of dry matter and 18.8 per cent of starch. When the number\r\nfound is half way between the numbers given in the table the mean of\r\nthe data above and below can be taken. In other positions a proper\r\ninterpolation can be made if desired but for practical purposes the\r\ndata corresponding to the nearest number can be used.\r\n\r\n    TABLE FOR CALCULATING STARCH IN\r\n    POTATOES FROM SPECIFIC GRAVITY.\r\n\r\n    10000 grams\r\n    of potatoes\r\n     weigh in     Per cent    Per cent\r\n      water.     dry matter.   starch.\r\n      Grams.\r\n\r\n        750         19.9        14.1\r\n        760         20.1        14.3\r\n        770         20.3        14.5\r\n        780         20.7        14.9\r\n        790         20.9        15.1\r\n        800         21.2        15.4\r\n        810         21.4        15.6\r\n        820         21.6        15.8\r\n        830         22.0        16.2\r\n        840         22.2        16.4\r\n        850         22.4        16.6\r\n        860         22.7        16.9\r\n        870         22.9        17.1\r\n        880         23.1        17.3\r\n        890         23.5        17.7\r\n        900         23.7        17.9\r\n        910         24.0        18.2\r\n        920         24.2        18.4\r\n        930         24.6        18.8\r\n        940         24.8        19.0\r\n        950         25.0        19.2\r\n        960         25.2        19.4\r\n        970         25.5        19.7\r\n        980         25.9        20.1\r\n        990         26.1        20.3\r\n       1000         26.3        20.5\r\n       1010         26.5        20.7\r\n       1020         26.9        21.1\r\n       1030         27.2        21.4\r\n       1040         27.4        21.6\r\n       1050         27.6        21.8\r\n       1060         28.0        22.2\r\n       1070         28.3        22.5\r\n       1080         28.5        22.7\r\n       1090         28.7        22.9\r\n       1100         29.1        23.3\r\n       1110         29.3        23.5\r\n       1120         29.5        23.7\r\n       1130         29.8        24.0\r\n       1140         30.2        24.4\r\n       1150         30.4        24.6\r\n       1160         30.6        24.8\r\n       1170         31.0        25.0\r\n       1180         31.3        25.5\r\n       1190         31.5        25.7\r\n       1200         31.7        25.9\r\n       1210         32.1        26.3\r\n       1220         32.3        26.5\r\n       1230         32.5        26.7\r\n       1240         33.0        27.2\r\n       1250         33.2        27.4\r\n       1260         33.4        27.6\r\n       1270         33.6        27.8\r\n       1280         34.1        28.3\r\n       1290         34.3        28.5\r\n       1300         34.5        28.7\r\n       1310         34.9        29.1\r\n       1320         35.1        29.3\r\n       1330         35.4        29.6\r\n       1340         35.8        30.0\r\n       1350         36.0        30.2\r\n       1360         36.2        30.4\r\n       1370         36.6        30.8\r\n\r\n=270. Constitution of Cellulose.=—The group of bodies known as\r\ncellulose comprises many members of essentially the same chemical\r\nconstitution but of varying properties. The centesimal composition of\r\npure cellulose is shown by the following numbers:\r\n\r\n    Carbon,   44.2 per cent\r\n    Hydrogen,  6.3  ”   ”\r\n    Oxygen,   49.5  ”   ”\r\n\r\ncorresponding to the formula C₆H₁₀H₅.\r\n\r\nAccording to the view of Cross and Bevan, cellulose conforms in respect\r\nof its ultimate constitutional groups to the general features of the\r\nsimple carbohydrates, but differs from them by reason of a special\r\nmolecular configuration resulting in a suppression of the activity of\r\nconstituent groups in certain respects, and an increase in activity of\r\nothers.[221]\r\n\r\n=271. Fiber and Cellulose.=—The carbohydrates of a plant insoluble in\r\nwater are not composed exclusively of starch. There are, in addition\r\nto starch, pentosan fibers yielding pentose sugars on hydrolysis and\r\nfurfuraldehyd on distillation with a strong acid. The quantitive\r\nmethods for estimating the pentosan bodies are given in paragraphs\r\n=150-157=. The method to be preferred is that of Krug (=155=).\r\n\r\nIn the estimation of cattlefoods and of plant substances in general the\r\nresidue insoluble in dilute boiling acid and alkali is called crude or\r\nindigestible fiber.\r\n\r\nThe principle on which the determination depends rests on the\r\nassumption that all the protein, starch and other digestible\r\ncarbohydrates will be removed from the sample by successive digestion\r\nat a boiling temperature with acid and alkali solutions of a given\r\nstrength. It is evident that the complex body obtained by the treatment\r\noutlined above is not in any sense a definite chemical compound, but it\r\nmay be considered as being composed partly of cellulose.\r\n\r\n=272. Official Method of Determining Crude Fiber.=—The method of\r\nestimating crude fiber, adopted by the Association of Official\r\nAgricultural Chemists, is as follows:[222]\r\n\r\nExtract two grams of the substance with ordinary ether, at least\r\nalmost completely, or use the residue from the determination of the\r\nether extract. To this residue, in a half liter flask, add 200 cubic\r\ncentimeters of boiling 1.25 per cent sulfuric acid; connect the flask\r\nwith an inverted condenser, the tube of which passes only a short\r\ndistance beyond the rubber stopper into the flask. Boil at once, and\r\ncontinue the boiling for thirty minutes. A blast of air conducted into\r\nthe flask may serve to reduce the frothing of the liquid. Filter, wash\r\nthoroughly with boiling water until the washings are no longer acid,\r\nrinse the substance back into the same flask with 200 cubic centimeters\r\nof a boiling 1.25 per cent solution of sodium hydroxid, free or nearly\r\nfree of sodium carbonate, boil at once and continue the boiling for\r\nthirty minutes in the same manner as directed above for the treatment\r\nwith acid. Filter into a gooch, and wash with boiling water until the\r\nwashings are neutral, dry at 110°, weigh and incinerate completely. The\r\nloss of weight is crude fiber.\r\n\r\nThe filter used for the first filtration may be linen, one of the forms\r\nof glass wool or asbestos filters, or any other form that secures clear\r\nand reasonably rapid filtration. The solutions of sulfuric acid and\r\nsodium hydroxid are to be made up of the specified strength, determined\r\naccurately by titration and not merely from specific gravity.\r\n\r\nThe experience of this laboratory has shown that results practically\r\nidentical with those got as above, are obtained by conducting the\r\ndigestions in hard glass beakers covered with watch glasses. The ease\r\nof manipulation in the modification of the process just mentioned is a\r\nsufficient justification for its use.\r\n\r\n=273. Separation of Cellulose.=—Hoppe-Seyler observed that cellulose,\r\nwhen melted with the alkalies at a temperature as high as 200°, was not\r\nsensibly attacked.[223]\r\n\r\nLange has based a process for determining cellulose on this\r\nobservation.[224]\r\n\r\nThe process, as improved by him, is carried out as follows:\r\n\r\nFrom five to ten grams of the substance are moistened with water and\r\nplaced in a porcelain dish with about three times their weight of\r\ncaustic alkali free of nitrates and about twenty cubic centimeters\r\nof water. The porcelain dish should be deep and crucible shaped and\r\nshould be placed in an oil-bath, the temperature of which is easily\r\ncontrolled. The contents of the dish are stirred with the thermometer\r\nbulb until all foaming ceases and the temperature of the mixture is\r\nthen kept at from 175° to 180° for an hour. After the melt has cooled\r\nto 80° about seventy-five cubic centimeters of hot water are added to\r\nbring it into solution and it is then allowed to cool. The solution is\r\nacidified with sulfuric and placed in large centrifugal tubes. After\r\nbeing made slightly alkaline with soda lye, the tubes are subjected\r\nto continued energetic centrifugal action until the cellulose is\r\nseparated. The supernatant liquid can be nearly all poured off and the\r\nseparated cellulose is broken up, treated with hot water and again\r\nseparated by centrifugal action. The cellulose is finally collected\r\nupon the asbestos felt, washed with hot water, alcohol and ether, dried\r\nand weighed. With a little practice it is possible to complete the\r\nseparation of cellulose in two and one-half hours.\r\n\r\n=274. Solubility of Cellulose.=—Cellulose resembles starch in its\r\ngeneral insolubility, but, unlike starch, it may be dissolved in some\r\nreagents and afterwards precipitated practically unchanged or in a\r\nstate of hydration. One of the simplest solvents of cellulose is zinc\r\nchlorid in concentrated aqueous solution.\r\n\r\nThe solution is accomplished with the aid of heat, adding one part by\r\nweight of cotton to six parts of zinc chlorid dissolved in ten parts of\r\nwater.\r\n\r\nA homogeneous sirup is obtained by this process, which is used in the\r\narts for making the carbon filaments of incandescent electric lamps.\r\n\r\nIn preparing the thread of cellulose, the solution, obtained as\r\ndescribed above, is allowed to flow, in a fine stream, into alcohol,\r\nwhereby a cellulose hydrate is precipitated, which is freed from zinc\r\nhydroxid by digesting in hydrochloric acid.\r\n\r\nHydrochloric acid may be substituted for water in preparing the reagent\r\nabove noted, whereby a solvent is secured which acts upon cellulose\r\nreadily in the cold.\r\n\r\nA solution of ammoniacal cupric oxid is one of the best solvents for\r\ncellulose. The solution should contain from ten to fifteen per cent of\r\nammonia and from two to two and a half of cupric oxid.\r\n\r\nIn the preparation of this reagent, ammonium chlorid is added to a\r\nsolution of cupric salt and then sodium hydroxid in just sufficient\r\nquantity to precipitate all of the copper as hydroxid. The precipitate\r\nis well washed on a linen filter, squeezed as dry as possible and\r\ndissolved in ammonia of 0.92 specific gravity. The cellulose is readily\r\nprecipitated from the solution in cuprammonium by the addition of\r\nalcohol, sodium chlorid, sugar, or other dehydrating agents. Solutions\r\nof cellulose are used in the arts for many purposes.[225]\r\n\r\n=275. Qualitive Reactions for Detecting Cellulose.=—Cellulose may be\r\nidentified by its resistance to the action of oxidizing agents, to the\r\nhalogens and to alkaline solutions. It is further recognized by the\r\nsirupy or gelatinous solutions it forms with the solvents mentioned\r\nabove. The cellulose hydrates precipitated from solutions have in some\r\ninstances the property of forming a blue color with iodin.\r\n\r\nA characteristic reaction of cellulose is secured as follows: To a\r\nsaturated solution of zinc hydrochlorate, of 2.00 specific gravity, are\r\nadded six parts by weight of potassium iodid dissolved in ten parts\r\nof water and this solution is saturated with iodin. Cellulose treated\r\nwith this reagent is at once stained a deep blue violet color.[226] For\r\nthe characteristics of cellulose occurring in wood the researches of\r\nLindsey may be consulted.[227]\r\n\r\n=276. More Rarely Occurring Carbohydrates.=—It is not possible here\r\nto give more space to the rarer forms of carbohydrates, to which the\r\nattention of the agricultural analyst may be called. Nearly a hundred\r\nkinds of sugars alone have been detected in the plant world. For\r\ndescriptions of the properties of these bodies and the methods of their\r\ndetection and determination, the standard works on carbohydrates may be\r\nconsulted.[228]\r\n\r\n\r\nAUTHORITIES CITED IN PART THIRD.\r\n\r\n[170] Vines; Physiology of Plants.

The\r\npolariscopic examination is made in a ten per cent solution at a\r\ntemperature of 20°. The gyrodynats of sucrose, dextrose and levulose\r\nat the temperature mentioned are fixed at 66.5, 53.5 and -81.9\r\nrespectively. The gravimetric determinations are conducted according\r\nto the methods already described. In the formulas for calculating\r\nthe results _a_ represents sucrose, _b_ reducing sugars, _x_ the\r\ndextrose, _y_ the levulose, and _d_ the observed polarization expressed\r\nin degrees angular measure. The gyrodynats of sucrose, dextrose and\r\nlevulose divided by 100 are represented by _s_, _d_ and _l_. The\r\ncalculations are made from the following formulas:\r\n\r\n    (_as_ + _xd_) - _yl_ = _p_.\r\n    (_as_ + _xd_) = _p_ + _yl_.\r\n    _xd_ = _p_ + _yl_ - _as_.\r\n\r\n          _p_ + _yl_ - _as_\r\n    _x_ = -----------------.\r\n               _d_\r\n\r\nIn this calculation the gyrodynat of levulose is about ten degrees\r\nlower than that of most authorities.\r\n\r\n[205] Vid. op. cit., 23, Band 24, S. 869.\r\n\r\n[206] Vid. op. cit. supra, 1888, S. 782.\r\n\r\n[207] Neue Zeitschrift für Rübenzucker-Industrie, Band 35, S. 166.\r\n\r\n[208] Journal of the American Chemical Society, Vol. 2, p. 399:\r\nScience, Oct. 1, 1881: Proceedings American Association for the\r\nAdvancement of Science, 1881, p. 61: Sugar Cane, Vol. 13, p. 533, pp.\r\n61-66.\r\n\r\n[209] Wiley and McElroy; Agricultural Science, Vol. 6, p. 57.\r\n\r\n[210] Chemical News, Vol. 46, p. 175.\r\n\r\n[211] Vid. op. cit, 14, p. 352.\r\n\r\n[212] Vid. op. et loc. cit., 41.\r\n\r\n[213] Vid. op. cit., 41, Vol. 65, p. 169.\r\n\r\n[214] Zeitschrift des Vereins für die Rübenzucker-Industrie, 1884, S.\r\n854.\r\n\r\n[215] Bulletin 46, Division of Chemistry, U.

Nomenclature.=—The terms fat and oil are often used\r\ninterchangeably and it is difficult in all cases to limit definitely\r\ntheir application. The consistence of the substance at usual room\r\ntemperatures may be regarded as a point of demarcation. The term fat,\r\nin this sense, is applied to glycerids which are solid or semi solid,\r\nand oil to those which are quite or approximately liquid. A further\r\nclassification is found in the origin of the glycerids, and this\r\ngives rise to the groups known as animal or vegetable fats and oils.\r\nIn this manual, in harmony with the practices mentioned above, the\r\nterm fat will be used to designate an animal or vegetable glycerid\r\nwhich is solid, and the term oil one which is liquid at common room\r\ntemperature, _viz._, about 20°. There are few animal oils, and few\r\nvegetable fats when judged by this standard, and it therefore happens\r\nthat the term oil is almost synonymous with vegetable glycerid and fat\r\nwith a glycerid of animal origin. Nearly related to the fats and oils\r\nis the group of bodies known as resins and waxes. This group of bodies,\r\nhowever, can be distinguished from the fats and oils by chemical\r\ncharacteristics. The waxes are ethers formed by the union of fatty\r\nacids and alcohols of the ethane, and perhaps also of the ethylene\r\nseries.[229] This chemical difference is not easily expressed and the\r\nterms themselves often add confusion to the meaning, as for instance,\r\njapan wax is composed mostly of fats, and sperm oil is essentially a\r\nwax.\r\n\r\n=278. Composition.=—Fats and oils are composed chiefly of salts\r\nproduced by the combination of the complex base glycerol with the fat\r\nacids. Certain glycerids, as the lecithins, contain also phosphorus\r\nin organic combinations, nitrogen, and possibly other inorganic\r\nconstituents in organic forms. By the action of alkalies the glycerids\r\nare easily decomposed, the acid combining with the inorganic base and\r\nthe glycerol becoming free. The salts thus produced form the soaps\r\nof commerce and the freed base, when collected and purified, is the\r\nglycerol of the trade.\r\n\r\nWhen waxes are decomposed by alkalies, fatty acids and alcohols of the\r\nethane series are produced.\r\n\r\nThe natural glycerids formed from glycerol, which is a trihydric\r\n(triatomic) alcohol, are found in the neutral state composed of three\r\nmolecules of the acid, united with one of the base. If R represent the\r\nradicle of the fat acid the general formula for the chemical process by\r\nwhich the salt is produced is:\r\n\r\n    Glycerol.  Acid.    Salt.    Water.\r\n         O.H               O.R\r\n     C₃H₅O.H + 3R.OH = C₃H₅O.R + 3H₂O.\r\n         O.H               O.R\r\n\r\nThe resulting salts are called triglycerids or neutral glycyl\r\nethers.[230] In natural animal and vegetable products, only the neutral\r\nsalts are found, the mono- and diglycerids resulting from artificial\r\nsynthesis. For this reason the prefix tri is not necessarily used in\r\ndesignating the natural glycerids, stearin, for instance, meaning the\r\nsame as tristearin.\r\n\r\n=279. Principal Glycerids.=—The most important glycerids which the\r\nanalyst will find are the following:\r\n\r\n    Olein,    C₃H₅O(O.C₁₈H₃₃O)₃.\r\n    Stearin,  C₃H₅O(O.C₁₈H₃₅)₃.\r\n    Palmitin, C₃H₅O(O.C₁₆H₃₁O)₃.\r\n    Linolein, C₃H₅O(O.C₁₈H₃₁O)₃.\r\n    Butyrin,  C₃H₅O(O.C₄H₇O)₃.\r\n\r\nOlein is the chief constituent of most oils; palmitin is found in palm\r\noil and many other natural glycerids; stearin is a leading constituent\r\nof the fats of beeves and sheep, and butyrin is a characteristic\r\nconstituent of butter, which owes its flavor largely to this glycerid\r\nand its nearly related concomitants.\r\n\r\n=280. Extraction of Oils and Fats.=—Preparatory to a physical and\r\nchemical study of the fats and oils is their separation from the\r\nother organic matters with which they may be associated. In the case\r\nof animal tissues this is usually accomplished by the application\r\nof heat. The operation known as rendering may be conducted in many\r\ndifferent ways. For laboratory purposes, the animal tissues holding the\r\nfat are placed in a convenient dish and a degree of heat applied which\r\nwill liquify all the fat particles and free them from their investing\r\nmembranes. The temperature employed should be as low as possible to\r\nsecure the desired effect, but fats can be subjected for some time to\r\na heat of a little more than 100°, without danger of decomposition.\r\nThe direct heat of a lamp, however, should not be applied, since it\r\nis difficult to avoid too high a temperature at the point of contact\r\nof the flame and dish. The dry heat of an air-bath or rendering in an\r\nautoclave or by steam is preferable. The residual animal matter is\r\nsubjected to pressure and the combined liquid fat freed from foreign\r\nmatters by filtering through a jacket filter, which is kept at a\r\ntemperature above the solidifying point of the contents.\r\n\r\nOn a large scale, as in rendering lard, the fat is separated by steam\r\nin closed vats which are strong enough to withstand the steam pressure\r\nemployed. For analytical purposes it is best to extract the fat from\r\nanimal tissues in the manner described, since the action of solvents\r\nis slow on fat particles enveloped in their containing membranes, and\r\nthe fats, when extracted, are liable to be contaminated with extraneous\r\nmatters. In dried and ground flesh meal, however, the fat may be\r\nextracted with the usual solvents. For the quantitive determination of\r\nfat in bones or flesh, the sample, as finely divided as possible, is\r\nthoroughly dried, and the fat separated from an aliquot finely powdered\r\nportion by extraction with chloroform, ether, or petroleum. The action\r\nof anhydrous ether on dried and powdered animal matters is apparently\r\na continuous one. Dormeyer has shown that even after an extraction of\r\nseveral months additional matter goes into solution.[231] The fat in such\r\ncases can be determined by saponification with alcoholic potash and the\r\nestimation of the free fatty acids produced.\r\n\r\nFrom vegetable substances, such as seeds, the fat is extracted either\r\nby pressure or by the use of solvents. For quantitive purposes, only\r\nsolvents are employed. The dry, finely ground material is exhausted\r\nwith anhydrous ether or petroleum spirit, in one of the convenient\r\nforms of apparatus already described (=33->43=). In very oily seeds\r\ngreat difficulty is experienced in securing a fine state of subdivision\r\nsuited to complete extraction. In such cases it is advisable to conduct\r\nthe process in two stages. In the first stage the material, in coarse\r\npowder, is exhausted as far as possible and the percentage of oil\r\ndetermined. The residue is then easily reduced to a fine powder, in an\r\naliquot part of which the remaining oil is determined in the usual way.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 79.—OIL PRESS.]\r\n\r\nIn securing oils for physical and chemical examination both pressure\r\nand solution may be employed. The purest oils are secured by pressure\r\nat a low temperature. To obtain anything like a good extraction some\r\nsort of hydraulic pressure must be used. In this laboratory a press\r\nis employed in which the first pressure is secured by a screw and\r\nthis is supplemented by hydraulic pressure in which glycerol is the\r\ntransmitting liquid. The construction of the press is shown in the\r\naccompanying figure.\r\n\r\nThe whole press is warmed to nearly 100°. The hot finely ground oily\r\nmaterial, enclosed in a cloth bag, is placed in the perforated cylinder\r\nand compressed as firmly as possible by turning with the hands the\r\nwheel shown at the top of the figure. The final pressure is secured by\r\nthe screw shown at the bottom of the figure whereby a piston is driven\r\ninto a cylinder containing glycerol. The degree of pressure obtained is\r\nequal to 300 atmospheres.\r\n\r\nEven with the best laboratory hydraulic pressure not more than\r\ntwo-thirds of the total oil contents of oleaginous seeds can be secured\r\nand the process is totally inapplicable to securing the oil from\r\ntissues when it exists in quantities of less than ten per cent. To get\r\npractically all of the oil the best method is to extract with carefully\r\ndistilled petroleum of low boiling point.\r\n\r\nIn the preparation of this reagent the petroleum ether of commerce,\r\ncontaining bodies boiling at temperatures of from 35° to 80°, is\r\nrepeatedly fractioned by distillation until a product is obtained\r\nwhich boils at from 45° to 60°. The distillation of this material\r\nis conducted in a large flask heated with steam, furnished with a\r\ncolumn containing a number of separatory funnels and connected with an\r\nappropriate condenser. The distillate is secured in a bottle packed\r\nwith broken ice, as shown in Fig. 80. A thermometer suspended in the\r\nvapor of the petroleum serves to regulate the process. Too much care\r\nto avoid accidents cannot be exercised in this operation. Not only\r\nmust steam be used in heating, but all flame and fire must be rigidly\r\nexcluded from the room in which the distillation takes place, and\r\nthe doors leading to other rooms where gas jets may be burning must\r\nbe kept closed. In the beginning of the process, as much as possible\r\nof the petroleum boiling under 45° must be removed and rejected. The\r\ndistillation is then continued until the temperature rises above 60°.\r\nThe parts of the distillate saved between these temperatures are\r\nredistilled under similar conditions. Other portions of the petroleum,\r\nboiling at other temperatures, may be secured in the same way. The\r\nproducts may be in a measure freed of unpleasant odors by redistilling\r\nthem from a mixture with lard. When used for quantitive purposes the\r\npetroleum ether must leave no residue when evaporated at 100°.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 80.—APPARATUS FOR FRACTIONAL DISTILLATION OF\r\nPETROLEUM ETHER.]\r\n\r\n=281. Freeing Extracted Oils from Petroleum.=—The petroleum ether which\r\nis used for extracting oils tends to give them an unpleasant odor and\r\nflavor and its entire separation is a matter of some difficulty. The\r\ngreater part of the solvent may be recovered as described in paragraph\r\n=43=. Heating the extracted oil for several hours in thin layers, will\r\nremove the last traces of the solvent, but affords opportunity for\r\noxidation, especially in the case of drying oils. An effective means\r\nof driving off the last traces of petroleum is to cause a current of\r\ndry carbon dioxid to pass through the sample contained in a cylinder\r\nand heated to a temperature of from 85° to 90°. The atmosphere of the\r\ninert gas will preserve the oil from oxidation and the sample will,\r\nas a rule, be found free of the petroleum odor after about ten hours\r\ntreatment. Ethyl ether or chloroform may be used instead of petroleum,\r\nbut these solvents act on other matters than the glycerids, and the\r\nextract is therefore liable to be contaminated with more impurities\r\nthan when the petroleum ether is employed. Other solvents for fats\r\nare carbon tetrachlorid, carbon disulfid, and benzene. In general,\r\npetroleum ether should be employed in preference to other solvents,\r\nexcept in the case of castor oil, which is difficultly soluble in both\r\npetroleum and petroleum ethers.\r\n\r\n=282. Freeing Fats Of Moisture.=—Any excess of water in glycerids will\r\naccumulate at the bottom of the liquid sample and can be removed by\r\ndecanting the fat or separating it from the oil by any other convenient\r\nmethod. The warm oil may be almost entirely freed of any residual\r\nmoisture by passing it through a dry filter paper in a jacket funnel\r\nkept at a high temperature. A section showing the construction of such\r\na funnel with a folded filter paper in place, is shown in Fig. 81.\r\nThe final drying, when great exactness is required, is accomplished\r\nin a vacuum, or in an atmosphere of inert gas, or in the cold in an\r\nexsiccator over sulfuric acid. In drying, it is well to expose the\r\nhot oil as little as possible to the action of the air. Wherever\r\nconvenient, it should be protected from oxidation by some inert gas or\r\na vacuum.\r\n\r\n=283. Sampling for Analysis.=—It is a matter of some difficulty to\r\nsecure a representative sample of a fat or oil for analytical purposes.\r\nThe moisture in a fat is apt to be unevenly distributed, and the\r\nsampling is to be accomplished in a manner to secure the greatest\r\npossible uniformity. When the quantity of material is of considerable\r\nquantity a trier may be used which will remove a cylindrical or partly\r\ncylindrical mass from the whole length or depth. By securing several\r\nsubsamples of this kind, and well mixing them, an average sample of the\r\nwhole mass may be secured. Where the fat is found in different casks\r\nor packages samples should be drawn from each as described above. The\r\nsubsamples are mixed together in weights corresponding to the different\r\ncasks from which they are taken and the mass obtained by this mixture\r\ndivided into three equal portions. Two of these parts are melted in a\r\ndish at a temperature not exceeding 60°, with constant stirring, and\r\nwhen fully liquid the third part is added. As a rule, the liquid fat\r\nretains enough heat to melt the added quantity. As soon as the mixed\r\nfats begin to grow pasty the mass is vigorously stirred to secure an\r\nintimate mixture of the water and other foreign bodies.[232]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 81.—SECTION SHOWING CONSTRUCTION OF A FUNNEL FOR\r\nHOT FILTRATION.]\r\n\r\nIn the case of butter fat the official chemists recommend that\r\nsubsamples be drawn from all parts of the package until about 500 grams\r\nare secured. The portions thus drawn are to be perfectly melted in a\r\nclosed vessel at as low a temperature as possible, and when melted\r\nthe whole is to be shaken violently for some minutes till the mass is\r\nhomogeneous, and sufficiently solidified to prevent the separation of\r\nthe water and fat. A portion is then poured into the vessel from which\r\nit is to be weighed for analysis, and this should nearly or quite fill\r\nit. This sample should be kept in a cold place till analyzed.[233]\r\n\r\n=284. Estimation of Water.=—In the official method for butter fat,\r\nwhich may be applied to all kinds, about two grams are dried to\r\nconstant weight, at the temperature of boiling water, in a dish with\r\nflat bottom, having a surface of at least twenty square centimeters.\r\n\r\nThe use of clean dry sand or asbestos is admissible, and is necessary\r\nif a dish with round bottom be employed.\r\n\r\nIn the method recommended by Benedikt, about five grams of the sampled\r\nfat are placed in a small flask or beaker and dried at 100° with\r\noccasional stirring to bring the water to the surface.\r\n\r\nAccording to the method of Sonnenschein, the sample is placed in a\r\nflask carrying a cork, with an arrangement of glass tubes, whereby a\r\ncurrent of dry air may be aspirated over the fat during the process\r\nof drying. When the flask is properly fitted its weight is taken, the\r\nfat put in and reweighed to get the exact amount. The fat is better\r\npreserved by aspirating carbon dioxid instead of air.[234] The moisture\r\nmay also be readily determined by drying on pumice stone, as described\r\nin paragraph =26=. In this case it is well to conduct the desiccation\r\nin vacuum or in an inert atmosphere to prevent oxidation.\r\n\r\n\r\nPHYSICAL PROPERTIES OF FATS.\r\n\r\n=285. Specific Gravity.=—The specific gravity of an oil is readily\r\ndetermined by a westphal balance (=53=), by a spindle, by a sprengel\r\ntube, or more accurately by a pyknometer. The general principles\r\ngoverning the conduct of the work have already been given (=48-59=).\r\nThe methods described for determining the density of sugar solutions\r\nare essentially the same as those used for oils, but it is to be\r\nremembered that oils and fats are lighter than water and the\r\ngraduation of the sinkers for the hydrostatic balance, and the\r\nspindles for direct determination must be for such lighter liquids.\r\nThe necessity of determining the density of a fat at a temperature\r\nabove its melting point is manifest, and for this reason the use of\r\nthe pyknometer at a high temperature (40° to 100°) is to be preferred\r\nto all the other processes, in the case of fats which are solid at\r\ntemperatures below 25°.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 82.—BALANCE AND WESTPHAL SINKER.]\r\n\r\nWhen great delicacy of manipulation is desired, combined with\r\nrapid work, an analytical balance and westphal sinker may be used\r\nconjointly.[235] In this case it is well to have two or three sinkers\r\ngraduated for 20°, 25°, and 40°, respectively. Nearly all fats,\r\nwhen melted and cooled to 40°, remain in a liquid state long enough\r\nto determine their density. The sinkers are provided with delicate\r\nthermometers, and the temperature, which at the beginning is a little\r\nabove the degree at which the sinker is graduated, is allowed to\r\nfall to just that degree, when the equilibrium is secured in the\r\nusual manner. The sinker is conveniently made to displace just five\r\ngrams of distilled water at the temperature of graduation, but it is\r\nevident that a round number is not necessary, but only convenient for\r\ncalculation.\r\n\r\n=286. Expression of Specific Gravity.=—Much confusion arises in the\r\nstudy of data of densities because the temperatures at which the\r\ndeterminations are made are not expressed. The absolute specific\r\ngravity would be a comparison of the weight of the object at 4°, with\r\nwater at the same temperature. It is evident that such determinations\r\nare not always convenient, and for this reason the determinations of\r\ndensity are usually made at other temperatures.\r\n\r\nIn the case of a sinker, which at 35° displaces exactly five grams of\r\nwater, the following statements may be made: One cubic centimeter of\r\nwater at 35° weighs 0.994098 gram. The volume of a sinker displacing\r\nfive grams of water at that temperature is therefore 5.0297 cubic\r\ncentimeters. This volume of water at 4° weighs 5.0297 grams. In a given\r\ncase the sinker placed in an oil at 35° is found to displace a weight\r\nequal to 4.5725 grams corresponding to a specific gravity of 35°/35°\r\n= 0.9145. From the foregoing data the following tabular summary is\r\nconstructed:\r\n\r\n    Weight of 5.0287 cubic centimeters of oil   at 35°, 4.5725 grams.\r\n      ”    ”  5.0297   ”        ”      ”  water at 35°, 5.0000   ”\r\n      ”    ”  5.0297   ”        ”      ”    ”   ”   4°, 5.0297   ”\r\n\r\n    Relative weight of oil at 35°, to water at 35°, 0.9145 grams.\r\n      ”        ”    ”   ”  ”  35°, ”    ”   ”   4°, 0.9092   ”\r\n\r\n=287. Coefficient of Expansion of Oils.=—Oils and fats of every\r\nkind have almost the same coefficient of expansion with increasing\r\ntemperature. The coefficient of expansion is usually calculated by the\r\nformula\r\n\r\n            _D_₀ - _D_₀ʹ\r\n    δ = ----------------\r\n        (_tʹ_ - _t_)_D_₀\r\n\r\nin which δ represents the coefficient of expansion, _D_₀ the density at\r\nthe lowest temperature, _D_₀ʹ the density at the highest temperature,\r\n_t_ the lowest, and _tʹ_ the highest temperatures.\r\n\r\nIn the investigations made by Crampton it was shown that the formula\r\nwould be more accurate, written as follows:[236]\r\n\r\n                _D_₀ - _D_₀ʹ\r\n    δ = ---------------------------\r\n        (_tʹ_ - _t_) × _D_₀ + _D_₀ʹ\r\n                     ---------------\r\n                            2\r\n\r\n\r\nThe absolute densities can be calculated from the formula Δ = δ +\r\n_K_, in which Δ represents the coefficient of absolute expansion, δ\r\nthe apparent coefficient of expansions observed in glass vessels, and\r\n_K_ the cubical coefficient of expansion of the glass vessel. The\r\nmean absolute coefficient of expansion for fats and oils, for 1° as\r\ndetermined by experiment, is almost exactly 0.0008, and the apparent\r\ncoefficient of expansion nearly 0.00077.[237]\r\n\r\n=288. Standard of Comparison.=—In expressing specific gravities it is\r\nadvisable to refer them always to water at 4°. The temperature at which\r\nthe observation is made should also be given. Thus the expression of\r\nthe specific gravity of lard, determined at different temperatures, is\r\nmade as follows:\r\n\r\n        15°.5                   40°\r\n    _d_ ------ = 0.91181;  _d_ ----- = 0.89679;\r\n          4°                     4°\r\n\r\n            100°\r\n    and _d_ ---- = 0.85997,\r\n             4°\r\n\r\nindicating the relative weights of the sample under examination at\r\n15°.5, 40°, and 100°, respectively, to water at 4°.\r\n\r\n=289. Densities of Common Fats and Oils.=—It is convenient to have at\r\nhand some of the data representing the densities of common fats and\r\noils, and the following numbers are from results of determinations made\r\nin this laboratory:[238]\r\n\r\n                                15°.5         40°         100°\r\n        Temperature.      _d_ = -----.  _d_ = ---.  _d_ = ----.\r\n                                  4°           4°          4°\r\n    Leaf lard                 0.91181         0.89679        0.85997\r\n    Lard stearin              0.90965         0.89443        0.85750\r\n    Oleostearin               0.90714         0.89223        0.85572\r\n    Crude cottonseed oil      0.92016         0.90486        0.86739\r\n    Summer    ”       ”       0.92055         0.90496        0.86681\r\n    Winter    ”       ”       0.92179         0.90612        0.86774\r\n    Refined   ”       ”       0.92150         0.90573        0.86714\r\n    Compound lard     ”       0.91515         0.90000        0.86289\r\n    Olive oil                 0.91505         0.89965        0.86168\r\n\r\n=290. Melting Point.=—The temperature at which fats become sensibly\r\nliquid is a physical characteristic of some importance. Unfortunately,\r\nthe line of demarcation between the solid and liquid states of this\r\nclass of bodies is not very clear. Few of them pass _per saltum_ from\r\none state to the other. In most cases there is a gradual transition,\r\nwhich, between its initial and final points, may show a difference\r\nof several degrees in temperature. It has been noted, further, that\r\nfats recently melted behave differently from those which have been\r\nsolid for several hours. For this reason it is advisable, in preparing\r\nglycerids for the determination of their melting point, to fuse them\r\nthe day before the examination is to be made. The temperature at which\r\na glycerid passes from a liquid to a solid state is usually higher than\r\nthat at which it resumes its solid form. If, however, the change of\r\ntemperature could be made with extreme slowness, exposing the sample\r\nfor many hours at near its critical temperature, these differences\r\nwould be much less marked.\r\n\r\nMany methods have been devised for determining the melting point of\r\nfats, and none has been found that is satisfactory in every respect. In\r\nsome cases the moment at which fluidity occurs is assumed to be that\r\none when the small sample loses its opalescence and becomes clear.\r\nIn other cases the moment of fluidity is determined by the change of\r\nshape of the sample or by observing the common phenomena presented by\r\na liquid body. In still other cases, the point at which the sample\r\nbecomes fluid is determined by the automatic completion of an electric\r\ncircuit, which is indicated by the ringing of a bell. This latter\r\nprocess has been found very misleading in our experience. Only a few of\r\nthe proposed methods seem to demand attention here, and some of those,\r\ndepending on the visible liquefaction of a small quantity of the fat or\r\nbased on the physical property, possessed by all liquids when removed\r\nfrom external stress, of assuming a spheroidal state will be described.\r\nOther methods which may demand attention in any particular case may be\r\nfound in the works cited.[239]\r\n\r\n=291. Determination in a Capillary Tube.=—A capillary tube is dipped\r\ninto the melted fat and when filled one end of the tube is sealed in\r\nthe lamp and it is then put aside in a cool place for twenty-four\r\nhours. At the end of this time the tube is tied to the bulb of a\r\ndelicate thermometer the length used or filled with fat being of the\r\nsame length as the thermometer bulb. The thermometer and attached fat\r\nare placed in water, oil, or other transparent media, and gently warmed\r\nuntil the capillary column of fat becomes transparent. At this moment\r\nthe thermometric reading is made and entered as the melting point of\r\nthe fat. In comparative determinations the same length of time should\r\nbe observed in heating, otherwise discordant results will be obtained.\r\nAs in all other methods, the resulting members are comparative and not\r\nabsolute points of fusion, and the data secured by two observers on the\r\nsame sample may not agree, if different methods of preparing the fat\r\nand different rates of fusion have been employed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 83.—MELTING POINT TUBES.]\r\n\r\nSeveral modifications of the method just described are practiced, and\r\nperhaps with advantage in some cases. In one of these a small particle\r\nof the fat is solidified in a bulb blown on a small tube, as indicated\r\nin Fig. 83, tube _a_. The tube, in an upright position, is heated in a\r\nconvenient bath until the particle of fat just begins to run assuming\r\nsoon the position shown in tube _b_. This temperature is determined\r\nby a thermometer, whose bulb is kept in contact with the part of the\r\nobservation tube containing the fat particle. The rise of temperature\r\nis continued until the fat collected at the bottom of the bulb is\r\nentirely transparent. This is called the point of complete fusion.[240]\r\n\r\nPohl covers the bulb of a thermometer with a thin film of fat, and the\r\ninstrument is then fixed in a test tube, in such a way as not to touch\r\nthe bottom, and the film of fat warmed by the air-bath until it fuses\r\nand collects in a droplet at the end of the thermometer bulb.[241]\r\n\r\nCarr has modified this process by inserting the thermometer in a round\r\nflask in such a way that the bulb of the thermometer is as nearly\r\nas possible in the center. By this device the heating through the\r\nintervening air is more regular and more readily controlled.[242]\r\n\r\nA particle of fat placed on the surface of clean mercury will melt\r\nwhen the mercury is raised to the proper temperature. Where larger\r\nquantities of the fat are employed, a small shot or pellet of mercury\r\nmay be placed upon the surface and the whole warmed until the metal\r\nsinks. Of the above noted methods, the analyst will find some form\r\nof capillary tube or the use of a film of the fat on the bulb of a\r\nthermometer the most satisfactory.[243]\r\n\r\nHehner and Angell have modified the sinking point method by increasing\r\nthe size of the sinker without a corresponding increase in weight.\r\nThis is accomplished by blowing a small pear-shaped float, nearly\r\none centimeter in diameter and about two long. The stem of the pear\r\nis drawn out and broken off, and while the bulb is still warm, the\r\nopen end of the stem is held in mercury, and a small quantity of this\r\nsubstance, sufficient in amount to cause the float to sink slowly\r\nthrough a melted fat, is introduced into the bulb of the apparatus\r\nand the stem sealed. The whole bulb should displace about one cubic\r\ncentimeter of liquid and weigh, after filling with mercury, about\r\nthree and four-tenths grams. In conducting the experiment about thirty\r\ngrams of the dry melted fat are placed in a large test tube and cooled\r\nby immersing the tube in water at a temperature of 15°. The tube\r\ncontaining the solidified fat is placed in a bath of cold water and the\r\nsinker is placed in the center of the surface of the fat. The bath is\r\nslowly heated until the float disappears. The temperature of the bath\r\nis read just as the bulb part of the float disappears. The method is\r\nrecommended especially by the authors for butter fat investigations.[244]\r\n\r\n=298. Melting Point Determined by the Spheroidal State.=—The method\r\ndescribed by the author, depending on the assumption of the spheroidal\r\nstate of a particle of liquid removed from all external stress, has\r\nbeen found quite satisfactory in this laboratory, and has been adopted\r\nby the official chemists.[245] In the preparation of the apparatus there\r\nare required:\r\n\r\n(_a_) a piece of ice floating in distilled water that has been recently\r\nboiled, and (_b_) a mixture of alcohol and water of the same specific\r\ngravity as the fat to be examined. This is prepared by boiling\r\ndistilled water and ninety-five per cent alcohol for a few minutes to\r\nremove the gases which they may hold in solution. While still hot, the\r\nwater is poured into the test tube described below until it is nearly\r\nhalf full. The test tube is then nearly filled with the hot alcohol,\r\nwhich is carefully poured down the side of the inclined tube to avoid\r\ntoo much mixing. If the alcohol is not added until the water has\r\ncooled, the mixture will contain so many air bubbles as to be unfit for\r\nuse. These bubbles will gather on the disk of fat as the temperature\r\nrises and finally force it to the top.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 84.—APPARATUS FOR THE DETERMINATION OF MELTING\r\nPOINT.]\r\n\r\nThe apparatus for determining the melting point is shown in Fig. 84,\r\nand consists of (_a_) an accurate thermometer reading easily tenths of\r\na degree; (_b_) a cathetometer for reading the thermometer (but this\r\nmay be done with an eye-glass if held steadily and properly adjusted);\r\n(_c_) a thermometer; (_d_) a tall beaker, thirty-five centimeters\r\nhigh and ten in diameter; (_e_) a test tube thirty centimeters long\r\nand three and a half in diameter; (_f_) a stand for supporting the\r\napparatus; (_g_) some method of stirring the water in the beaker (for\r\nexample, a blowing bulb of rubber, and a bent glass tube extending to\r\nnear the bottom of the beaker).\r\n\r\nThe disks of fat are prepared as follows: The melted and filtered fat\r\nis allowed to fall from a dropping tube from a height of about twenty\r\ncubic centimeters on a smooth piece of ice floating in recently boiled\r\ndistilled water. The disks thus formed are from one to one and a half\r\ncentimeters in diameter and weigh about 200 milligrams. By pressing the\r\nice under the water the disks are made to float on the surface, whence\r\nthey are easily removed with a steel spatula, which should be cooled in\r\nthe ice water before using. They should be prepared a day or at least a\r\nfew hours before using.\r\n\r\nThe test tube containing the alcohol and water is placed in a tall\r\nbeaker, containing water and ice, until cold. The disk of fat is then\r\ndropped into the tube from the spatula, and at once sinks until it\r\nreaches a part of the tube where the density of the alcohol-water is\r\nexactly equivalent to its own. Here it remains at rest and free from\r\nthe action of any force save that inherent in its own molecules.\r\n\r\nThe delicate thermometer is placed in the test tube and lowered until\r\nthe bulb is just above the disk. In order to secure an even temperature\r\nin all parts of the alcohol mixture in the vicinity of the disk, the\r\nthermometer is gently moved from time to time in a circularly pendulous\r\nmanner.\r\n\r\nThe disk having been placed in position, the water in the beaker is\r\nslowly heated, and kept constantly stirred by means of the blowing\r\napparatus already described.\r\n\r\nWhen the temperature of the alcohol-water mixture rises to about\r\n6° below the melting point, the disk of fat begins to shrivel, and\r\ngradually rolls up into an irregular mass.\r\n\r\nThe thermometer is now lowered until the fat particle is even with the\r\ncenter of the bulb. The bulb of the thermometer should be small, so as\r\nto indicate only the temperature of the mixture near the fat. A gentle\r\nrotatory movement from time to time should be given to the thermometer\r\nbulb. The rise of temperature should be so regulated that the last\r\n2° of increment require about ten minutes. The mass of fat gradually\r\napproaches the form of a sphere, and when it is sensibly so the reading\r\nof the thermometer is to be made. As soon as the temperature is taken\r\nthe test tube is removed from the bath and placed again in the cooler.\r\nA second tube, containing alcohol and water, is at once placed in the\r\nbath. The test tube (ice water having been used as a cooler) is of\r\nlow enough temperature to cool the bath sufficiently. After the first\r\ndetermination, which should be only a trial, the temperature of the\r\nbath should be so regulated as to reach a maximum of about 1°.5 above\r\nthe melting point of the fat under examination.\r\n\r\nThe edge of the disk should not be allowed to touch the sides of the\r\ntube. This accident rarely happens, but in case it should take place,\r\nand the disk adhere to the sides of the tube, a new trial should be\r\nmade.\r\n\r\nTriplicate determinations should be made, and the second and third\r\nresults should show a near agreement.\r\n\r\n_Example._—Melting point of sample of butter:\r\n\r\n                  Degrees.\r\n    First trial    33.15\r\n    Second trial   33.05\r\n    Third trial    33.00\r\n\r\nThe fatty acids, being soluble in alcohol, cannot be treated as the\r\nordinary glycerids. But even those glycerids which are slightly soluble\r\nin alcohol may be subjected to the above treatment without fear of\r\nexperiencing any grave disturbance of the fusing points.\r\n\r\n=293. Solidifying Point.=—The temperature at which a fat shows\r\nincipient solidification is usually lower than the point of fusion.\r\nThe same difficulties are encountered in determining the temperature\r\nof solidification as are presented in observing the true melting\r\npoint. The passage from a transparent liquid to an opaque solid is\r\ngradual, showing all the phases of turbidity from beginning opalescence\r\nto complete opacity. The best the analyst can do is to determine,\r\nas accurately as possible, the temperature at which the more solid\r\nglycerids of the mixture begin to form definite crystals. This point is\r\naffected to a marked degree by the element of time. A fat cooled just\r\nbelow its melting point will become solid after hours, or days, whereas\r\nit could be quickly cooled far below that temperature and still be\r\nlimpid.\r\n\r\nThe methods of observation are the same for the glycerids and fatty\r\nacids, and the general process of determination is sufficiently set\r\nforth in the following description of the method as used in this\r\nlaboratory.[246]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 85.—APPARATUS FOR DETERMINING CRYSTALLIZING POINT.]\r\n\r\nThe melted fat or fat acid is placed in a test tube contained in a\r\nlarge bottle, which serves as a jacket to protect the tube from sudden\r\nor violent changes of temperature. The efficiency of the jacket may\r\nbe increased by exhausting the air therefrom, as in the apparatus\r\nfor determining the heat of bromination, hereafter described. A very\r\ndelicate thermometer, graduated in tenths of a degree, and having a\r\nlong bulb, is employed. By means of the reading glass, the reading can\r\nbe made in twentieths of a degree. The arrangement of the apparatus\r\nis shown in Fig. 85. The test tube is nearly filled with the melted\r\nmatter. The bottom of the jacket should be gently warmed to prevent a\r\ntoo rapid congelation in the bottom of the test tube containing the\r\nmelted fat, and the tube is to be so placed as to leave an air space\r\nbetween it and the bottom of the bottle. The thermometer is suspended\r\nin such a manner as to have the bulb as nearly as possible in the\r\ncenter of the melted fat. The thermometer should be protected from air\r\ncurrents and should be kept perfectly still. In case the congealing\r\npoint is lower than room temperature the jacket may be immersed in a\r\ncooling mixture, the temperature of which is only slightly below the\r\nfreezing point of the fatty mass.\r\n\r\nWhen crystals of fat begin to form, the descent of the mercury in the\r\nstem of the thermometer will become very slow and finally reach a\r\nminimum, which should be noted. As the crystallization extends inwards\r\nand approaches the bulb of the thermometer a point will be reached when\r\nthe mercury begins to rise. At this time the partially crystallized\r\nmass should be vigorously stirred with the thermometer and again left\r\nat rest in as nearly, the original position as possible. By this\r\noperation the mercury will be made to rise and its maximum position\r\nshould be noted as the true crystallizing point of the whole mass.\r\nIn comparing different samples, it is important that the elements of\r\ntime in which the first crystallization takes place should be kept, as\r\nnearly as possible, the same. A unit of one hour in cooling the mixture\r\nfrom a temperature just above its point of fusion until the incipient\r\ncrystallization is noticed, is a convenient one for glycerids and for\r\nfat acids.\r\n\r\n=294. Determination of Refractive Power.=—The property of refracting\r\nlight is possessed by fats in different degrees and these differences\r\nare of great help in analytical work. The examination may be made by\r\nthe simple refractometer of Abbe or Bertrand, or by the more elaborate\r\napparatus of Pulfrich.\r\n\r\nThe comparative refractive power of fats can also be observed by\r\nmeans of the oleorefractometer of Amagat-Jean or the differential\r\nrefractometer of Zune.[247]\r\n\r\nFor details of the construction of these apparatus, with a description\r\nof the optical principles on which they are based, the papers above\r\ncited may be consulted. In this laboratory the instruments which have\r\nbeen employed are three in number, _viz._, Abbe’s small refractometer,\r\nPulfrich’s refractometer using yellow light, and the oleorefractometer\r\nof Amagat-Jean. A brief description of the methods of manipulating\r\nthese instruments is all that can be attempted in this manual.\r\n\r\n=295. Refractive Index.=—Refractive index is an expression employed to\r\ncharacterize the measurement of the degree of deflection caused in a\r\nray of light in passing from one transparent medium into another. It is\r\nthe quotient of the sine of the angle of the incident, divided by the\r\nsine of the angle of the refracted ray.\r\n\r\nIn the case of oils which remain liquid at room temperatures, the\r\ndeterminations can be made without the aid of any device to maintain\r\nliquidity. In the case of fat which becomes solid at ordinary room\r\ntemperatures, the determination must either be made in a room\r\nartificially warmed or the apparatus must have some device, as in\r\nthe later instruments of Abbe and Pulfrich, and in the apparatus of\r\nAmagat-Jean, whereby the sample under examination can be maintained in\r\na transparent condition. In each case the accuracy of the apparatus\r\nshould be tested by pure water, the refractive index of which at 18°\r\nis 1.333. The refractive index is either read directly on the scale\r\nas in Abbe’s instrument, or calculated from the angles measured as in\r\nPulfrich’s apparatus.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 86.—ABBE’S REFRACTOMETER.]\r\n\r\n=296. Abbe’s Refractometer.=—For practical use the small instrument\r\ninvented by Abbe will be found sufficient. The one which has been\r\nin use for many years in this laboratory is shown in Fig. 86. The\r\nillustration represents the apparatus in the position preliminary to\r\nreading the index. In preparing the sample of oil for observation the\r\ninstrument is turned on its axis until the prisms between which the\r\noil is placed assume a horizontal position, as is seen in Fig. 87. The\r\nmovable prism is unfastened and laid aside, the fixed prism covered\r\nwith a rectangular shaped piece of tissue paper on which one or two\r\ndrops of the oil are placed. The movable prism is replaced in such a\r\nmanner as to secure a complete separation of the two prisms by the film\r\nof oiled tissue paper. A little practice will enable the analyst to\r\nsecure this result.\r\n\r\nAfter the paper disk holding the fat is secured by replacing the upper\r\nprism, the apparatus is placed in its normal position and the index\r\nmoved until the light directed through the apparatus by the mirror\r\nshows the field of vision divided into dark and light portions. The\r\ndispersion apparatus is now turned until the rainbow colors on the part\r\nbetween the dark and light fields have disappeared. Before doing this,\r\nhowever, the telescope, the eyepiece of the apparatus, is so adjusted\r\nas to bring the cross lines of the field of vision distinctly into\r\nfocus. The index of the apparatus is now moved back and forth until the\r\nline of the two fields of vision falls exactly at the intersection of\r\nthe cross lines. The refractive index of the fat under examination is\r\nthen read directly upon the scale by means of a small magnifying glass.\r\nTo check the accuracy of the first reading, the dispersion apparatus\r\nshould be turned through an angle of 180° until the colors have again\r\ndisappeared, and, after adjustment, the scale of the instrument again\r\nread. These two readings should nearly coincide, and their mean is the\r\ntrue reading of the fat under examination.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 87.—CHARGING POSITION OF REFRACTOMETER.]\r\n\r\nFor butter fats the apparatus should be kept in a warm place, the\r\ntemperature of which does not fall below 30°. For reducing the results\r\nobtained to a standard temperature, say 25°, the factor 0.000176 may be\r\nused. As the temperature rises the refractive index falls.\r\n\r\n_Example._—Refractive index of a butter fat determined at 32°.4 =\r\n1.4540, reduced to 25° as follows: 32.4 -25 = 7.4; 0.000176 × 7.4 =\r\n0.0013; then 1.4540 + 0.0013 = 1.4553.\r\n\r\nThe instrument used should be set with distilled water at 18°, the\r\ntheoretical refractive index of water at that temperature being 1.333.\r\nIn the determination above given, the refractive index of pure water\r\nmeasured 1.3300; hence the above numbers should be corrected for theory\r\nby the addition of 0.0030, making the corrected index of the butter fat\r\nmentioned at the temperature given, 1.4583.\r\n\r\n=297. Pulfrich’s Refractometer.=—For exact scientific measurements,\r\nPulfrich’s apparatus has given here entire satisfaction. In this\r\ninstrument a larger quantity of the oil is required than for the\r\nabbe, and this quantity is held in a cylindrical glass vessel luted\r\nto the top of the prism. The method of accomplishing this and also an\r\nillustration of the refraction of the rays of light are shown in Fig.\r\n88.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 88.—PRISM OF PULFRICH’S REFRACTOMETER.]\r\n\r\nThe angle _i_ is measured by a divided circle read with the aid of a\r\nsmall telescope. The index of the prism of highly refractive glass\r\n_N_ is known. The oil is seen at _n_. The light used is the yellow\r\nsodium ray (_D_). From the observed angle the refractive index of n is\r\ncalculated from the formula\r\n\r\n           ______________\r\n    _n_ = √_N_² - sin²_i_.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor convenience the values of _n_ for all usual values of _i_ are\r\ncomputed once for all and arranged for use in tabular form. The latest\r\nmodel of Pulfrich’s apparatus, arranged both for liquid and solid\r\nbodies, and also for spectrometric observation is shown in Fig. 89.\r\n\r\nWhen the sodium light is used it is placed behind the apparatus and\r\nthe light is collected and reflected on the refractive prism by the\r\nlens _N_. Through _H_ and _G_ is secured the micrometric reading of the\r\nangle on the scale _D_ by means of the telescopic arrangement _F E_.\r\nFor regulating the temperature of the oil and adjacent parts, a stream\r\nof water at any desired temperature is made to circulate through _L_\r\nand _S_ in the direction indicated by the arrows. The manner in which\r\nthis is accomplished is shown in the cross section of that part of the\r\napparatus as indicated in Fig. 90.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 89.—PULFRICH’S NEW REFRACTOMETER.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 90.—HEATING APPARATUS FOR PULFRICH’S REFRACTOMETER.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 91.—SPECTROMETER ATTACHMENT.]\r\n\r\nFor further details of the construction and operation of the apparatus\r\nthe original description may be consulted.[248]\r\n\r\nIn case a spectrometric observation is desired the _H_ ray, for\r\ninstance, is produced by the geissler tube _Q_, Fig. 91. The light is\r\nconcentrated and thrown upon the refractive prism by the lens _P_, the\r\nlens _N_, Fig. 89, being removed for this purpose.\r\n\r\nTables, for correcting the dispersion and for calculating the indices\r\nfor each angle and fraction thereof, and for corrections peculiar to\r\nthe apparatus, accompany each instrument.\r\n\r\n=298. Refractive Indices of some Common Oils.=—The following numbers\r\nshow the refractive indices obtained by Long for some of the more\r\ncommon oils. The light used was the yellow ray of the sodium flame.[249]\r\n\r\n                                          Refractive  Calculated\r\n            Name.

In this case\r\nthe reading of the scale gives the index as determined by the yellow\r\nray.

Oleorefractometer.=—Instead of measuring the angular value of\r\nthe refractive power of an oil it may be compared with some standard\r\non a purely arbitrary scale. Such an apparatus is illustrated by the\r\noleorefractometer of Amagat-Jean, or by Zeiss’s butyrorefractometer.\r\n\r\nIn the first named instrument, Fig. 92, the oil to be examined is\r\ncompared directly with another typical oil and the shadow produced by\r\nthe difference in refraction is located on a scale read by a telescope\r\nand graduated for two different temperatures.[251] The internal\r\nstructure of the apparatus is shown in Fig. 93.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 92.—OLEOREFRACTOMETER.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 93.—SECTION SHOWING CONSTRUCTION OF\r\nOLEOREFRACTOMETER.]\r\n\r\nIn the center of the apparatus a metal cylinder, _A_, is found carrying\r\ntwo plate glass pieces, _C B_, so placed as to form an angle of 107°.\r\nThis cylinder is placed in a larger one, provided with two circular\r\nglass windows. To these two openings are fixed to the right and left,\r\nthe telescopic attachments, _G_, _V, S, E_, and the apparatus _M, H,\r\nSʹ_, _Eʹ_, for rendering the rays of light parallel. The field of\r\nvision is divided into two portions, light and dark, by a semicircular\r\nstop inserted in the collimator, and contains the double scale shown\r\nin the figure placed at _H_. The field of vision is illuminated by a\r\ngas or oil lamp placed at a convenient distance from the collimator.\r\nThe inner metallic cylinder _A_ is surrounded with an outer one, to\r\nwhich the optical parts are attached at _D Dʹ_ by means of plane glass\r\nplates. This cylinder is in turn contained in the large water cylinder\r\n_P P_, carrying a thermometer in the opening shown at the top on the\r\nleft. The manipulation of the apparatus is very simple. The outer\r\ncylinder is filled with water, at a temperature below 22°, the middle\r\none with the typical oil furnished with the instrument, the cover of\r\nthe apparatus carrying the thermometer placed in position and the\r\ncup-shaped funnel inserted in the cylinder _A_, which is at first also\r\nfilled with the typical oil. The whole system is next brought slowly\r\nto the temperature of 22° by means of the lamp shown in Fig. 92. The\r\ntelescope is adjusted to bring the scale of the field of vision into\r\nfocus and the line dividing the light and shadow of the field should\r\nfall exactly on 0°_a_. If this be not the case the 0° is adjusted by\r\nscrews provided for that purpose until it is in proper position. The\r\ntypical oil is withdrawn from _A_ by the cock _R_, the cylinder washed\r\nwith a little of the oil to be examined and then filled therewith. On\r\nagain observing the field of vision the line separating the shadow from\r\nthe light will be found moved to the right or left, if the oil have\r\nan index different from that of the typical oil. The position of the\r\ndividing line is read on the scale.\r\n\r\nFor fats the temperature of the apparatus is brought exactly to 45°\r\nand the scale 0°b is used. In other respects the manipulation for\r\nthe fats is exactly that described for oils. In the use of 0°a, in\r\ncase the room be warmer than 22°, all the liquids employed should be\r\ncooled below 22° before being placed in the apparatus. It is then only\r\nnecessary to wait until the room temperature warms the system to 22°.\r\nIn the case of fats it is advisable to heat all the liquids to about\r\n50° and allow them to cool to 45° instead of heating them to that\r\ntemperature by means of the lamp.\r\n\r\nOne grave objection to this instrument is found in the absence of the\r\nproper scientific spirit controlling its manufacture and sale, as\r\nevidenced by the attempt to preserve the secret of the composition\r\nof the typical oil and the negligence in testing the scale of the\r\ninstruments which will be pointed out further along.\r\n\r\nAccording to Jean[252] the common oils, when purified, give the\r\nfollowing readings at 22°:\r\n\r\n    Peanut oil     +3.5 to  +6.5\r\n    Colza   ”     +17.5 ”  +21.0\r\n    Cotton  ”     +18.0 ”  +18.0\r\n    Linseed ”     +47.0 ”  +54.5\r\n    Lard    ”      +5.5 ”   +5.5\r\n    Olive   ”      +1.5 ”    0.0\r\n    Sesamé  ”     +17.5 ”  +19.0\r\n    Oleomargarin  -15.0 ”  -15.0\r\n    Butter fat    -30.0 ”  -30.0\r\n    Mutton oil      0.0 ”    0.0\r\n    Fish    ”     +38.0 ”  +38.0\r\n\r\nIn this instrument, therefore, vegetable and fish oils, as a rule, show\r\na right hand, and animal fats a left hand deviation.\r\n\r\nThe oleorefractometer has been extensively used in this laboratory and\r\nthe data obtained thereby have been found useful. We have not found,\r\nhowever, the values fixed by Jean to be constant. The numbers for lard\r\nhave varied from -3.0 to -10.0, and other fats have shown almost as\r\nwide a variation from the values assigned by him.\r\n\r\nJean states that the number for lard, determined by the\r\noleorefractometer, is -12, and he gives a definite number for each of\r\nthe common oils and fats. On trying the pure lards of known origin in\r\nthis instrument, I have never yet found one that showed a deviation of\r\n-12 divisions of the scale; but I have no doubt that there are many\r\nsuch lards in existence. The pure normal lards derived from the fat\r\nof a single animal would naturally show greater variations in their\r\nchemical and physical properties, than a typical lard derived from\r\nthe mixed fats of a great many animals. In leaf lard, rendered in the\r\nlaboratory, the reading of the oleorefractometer was found to be -10°,\r\nwhile with the intestinal lard it was -9°. On the other hand, a lard\r\nrendered from the fat from the back of the animal showed a reading of\r\nonly -3°, and a typical cottonseed oil a reading of +12°. According\r\nto the statement of Jean, a lard which gives even as low a refractive\r\nnumber as -9, by his instrument, would be adjudged at least one-quarter\r\ncottonseed oil.\r\n\r\nAfter a thorough trial of the instrument of Jean, I am convinced that\r\nit is of great diagnostic value, but if used in the arbitrary manner\r\nindicated by the author it would lead to endless error and confusion.\r\nIn other words, this instrument is of greater value in analyses than\r\nAbbe’s ordinary refractometer, because it gives a wider expansion in\r\nthe limits of the field of vision, and therefore can be more accurately\r\nread, but it is far from affording a certain means of discovering\r\ntraces of adulteration with other fats.\r\n\r\n=300. Variations in the Instruments.=—In the use of the\r\noleorefractometer, attention should be called to the fact that, through\r\nsome negligence in manufacture, the instruments do not give, in all\r\ninstances, the same reading with the same substance. Allen obtained the\r\nfollowing data with a sample of lard examined in three instruments,\r\n_viz._, 4°.5, 6°, and 11°. Such wide differences in the scales of\r\nthe instruments cannot fail to disparage the value of comparative\r\ndeterminations.\r\n\r\nThe variations in samples of known origin, when read on the same\r\ninstrument, however, will show the range of error to which the\r\ndeterminations made with the oleorefractometer are subject. Pearmain\r\nhas tabulated a large number of observations of this kind, covering 240\r\nsamples of oils.[253]\r\n\r\nFollowing are the data relating to the most important oils.\r\n\r\n                      AT 22°.\r\n\r\n                          Highest    Lowest     Mean\r\n                          reading.  reading.  reading.\r\n        Name of oil.

Butyrorefractometer.=—Another instrument graduated on an\r\narbitrary scale is the butyrorefractometer of Zeiss. This apparatus,\r\nwhich resembles in some respects the instrument of Abbe, differs\r\ntherefrom essentially in dispensing with the revolving prisms of\r\nAmici, whereby the chromatic fringing due to dispersion is corrected,\r\nand on having the scale fixed for one substance, in this instance,\r\npure butter fat. The form of the instrument is shown in Fig. 94. The\r\nachromatization for the butter fat is secured in the prisms between\r\nwhich a film of the fat is placed, as in the Abbe instrument. When\r\na fat, differing from that for which the instrument is graduated is\r\nintroduced, the fringes of the dark and light portions of the field\r\nwill not only be colored (difference in dispersion), but the line of\r\nseparation will also be displaced (difference in refractive power). The\r\napparatus is therefore used in the differential determination of these\r\ntwo properties. It must not be forgotten, however, that butter fats\r\ndiffer so much in these properties among themselves as to make possible\r\nthe condemnation of a pure as an adulterated sample.\r\n\r\n=302. Method of Charging the Apparatus.=—The prism casing of the\r\ninstrument is opened by turning the pin _F_ to the right and pushing\r\nthe half _B_ of the prism casing aside. The prism and its appendages\r\nmust be cleaned with the greatest care, the best means for this purpose\r\nbeing soft clean linen moistened with a little alcohol or ether.\r\n\r\nMelt the sample of butter in a spoon and pour it upon a small paper\r\nfilter held between the fingers and apply the first two or three drops\r\nof clear butter fat so obtained to the surface of the prism contained\r\nin prism casing _B_. For this purpose the apparatus should be raised\r\nwith the left hand so as to place the prism surface in a horizontal\r\nposition.\r\n\r\nPress _B_ against _A_ and replace _F_ by turning it in the opposite\r\ndirection into its original position; thereby _B_ is prevented from\r\nfalling back and both prism surfaces are kept in close contact.\r\n\r\n=303. Method of Observation.=—While looking into the telescope, give\r\nthe mirror _J_ such a position as to render the critical line which\r\nseparates the bright left part of the field from the dark right part\r\ndistinctly visible. It may also be necessary to move or turn the\r\ninstrument about a little. First it will be necessary to ascertain\r\nwhether the space between the prism surfaces be uniformly filled with\r\nbutter, for, if not, the critical line will not be distinct.\r\n\r\nBy allowing a current of water of constant temperature to flow through\r\nthe apparatus, some time previous to the taking of the reading, the at\r\nfirst somewhat hazy critical line approaches in a short time, generally\r\nafter a minute, a fixed position and quickly attains its greatest\r\ndistinctness. When this point has been reached note the appearance of\r\nthe critical line (_i. e._, whether colorless or colored and in the\r\nlatter case of what color); also note the position of the critical line\r\non the centesimal scale, which admits of the tenth divisions being\r\nconveniently estimated, and at the same time read the thermometer. By\r\nmaking an extended series of successive readings and by employing an\r\nassistant for melting and preparing the small samples of butter, from\r\ntwenty-five to thirty refractometric butter tests may, after a little\r\npractice, be made in an hour.\r\n\r\nThe readings of the refractive indices of a large number of butter\r\nsamples made at 25° are, by means of a table which will be found\r\nbelow, directly reduced to scale divisions and yield the following\r\nequivalents:[254]\r\n\r\n    Natural butter (1.4590-1.4620) : 49.5-54.0 scale divisions.\r\n    Margarin       (1.4650-1.4700) : 58.6-66.4   ”       ”\r\n    Mixtures       (1.4620-1.4690) : 54.0-64.8   ”       ”\r\n\r\nWhenever, in the refractometric examination of butter at a temperature\r\nof 25°, higher values than 54.0 are found for the critical lines these\r\nsamples will, according to Wollny, by chemical analysis, always be\r\nfound to be adulterated; but in all samples in which the value for\r\nthe position of the critical line does not fall below 52.5, chemical\r\nanalysis maybe dispensed with and the samples may be pronounced to be\r\npure butter.\r\n\r\nIn calculating the position of the critical line for other temperatures\r\nthan 25° allow for 1° variation of temperature a mean value of 0.55\r\nscale division. The following table, which has been compiled in this\r\nmanner, shows the values corresponding to various temperatures, each\r\nvalue being the upper limit of scale divisions admissible in pure\r\nbutter:\r\n\r\n    Temp.

If\r\nthe reading show higher numbers for the critical line the sample should\r\nbe reserved for chemical analysis. A special thermometer for use in the\r\nexamination of butter will be described in the section devoted to dairy\r\nproducts.\r\n\r\n=304. Range of Application of the Butyrorefractometer.=—The extended\r\nrange of the ocular scale of the refractometer, _n_ = 1.42 to 1.49,\r\nwhich embraces the refractive indices of the majority of oils and fats,\r\nrenders the instrument applicable for testing oils and fats and also\r\nfor examining glycerol.\r\n\r\nBy reference to the subjoined table the scale divisions may be\r\ntransformed into terms of refractive indices. It gives the refractive\r\nindices for yellow light for every ten divisions of the scale. The\r\ndifferential column Δ gives the change of the refractive indices in\r\nterms of the fourth decimal per scale division. Owing to the accuracy\r\nwith which the readings can be taken (0.1 scale division) the error of\r\nthe value of _n_ rarely exceeds one unit of the fourth decimal of _n_.\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLE OF REFRACTIVE INDICES.\r\n\r\n    Scale div.  n_{D}.

In cases, however, where the critical line presents very\r\nbroad fringes (turpentine, linseed oil, etc.) it is advisable to repeat\r\nthe reading with the aid of a sodium flame.\r\n\r\n=305. Viscosity.=—An important property of an oil, especially when its\r\nlubricating qualities are considered, is the measure of the friction\r\nwhich the particles exert on other bodies and among themselves, in\r\nother words, its viscosity. In the measure of this property no definite\r\nelement can be considered, but the analyst must be content with\r\ncomparing the given sample with the properties of some other liquid\r\nregarded as a standard. The usual method of procedure consists in\r\ndetermining the time required for equal volumes of the two liquids to\r\npass through an orifice of given dimensions, under identical conditions\r\nof temperature and pressure. In many instances the viscosity of oils is\r\ndetermined by comparing them with water or rape oil, while, in other\r\ncases, a solution of sugar is employed as the standard of measurement.\r\n\r\nIn case rape oil be taken as a standard and its viscosity represented\r\nby 100 the number representing the viscosity of any other oil may be\r\nfound by multiplying the number of seconds required for the outflow of\r\nfifty cubic centimeters by 100 and dividing by 535. If the specific\r\ngravity vary from that of rape oil, _viz._, 0.915, at 15°, a correction\r\nmust be made by multiplying the result obtained above by the specific\r\ngravity of the sample and dividing the product by 0.915. If _n_ be the\r\nobserved time of outflow in seconds and _s_ the specific gravity the\r\nviscosity is expressed as follows:[255]\r\n\r\n          _n_ × 100 × _s_     _n_ × 100 × _s_\r\n    _V_ = ---------------- = ----------------.\r\n            535 × 0.195          489.525\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 95.—DOOLITTLE’S VISCOSIMETER.]\r\n\r\nIt is important that the height of the oil in the cylinders from which\r\nit is delivered be kept constant, and this is secured by supplying\r\nadditional quantities, on the principle of the mariotte bottle.\r\n\r\n=306. The Torsion Viscosimeter.=—In this laboratory the torsion\r\nviscosimeter, based on the principle described by Babcock is used.\r\nThe instrument employed is the one described by Doolittle.[256] The\r\nconstruction of the apparatus is illustrated in Fig. 95.\r\n\r\nA steel wire is suspended from a firm support and fastened to a stem\r\nwhich passes through a graduated horizontal disk, thus permitting the\r\naccurate measurement of the torsion of the wire. The disk is adjusted\r\nso that the index point reads exactly _0_, thus showing that there is\r\nno torsion in the wire. A brass cylinder seven centimeters long by\r\nfive in diameter, having a slender stem by which to suspend it, is\r\nimmersed in the oil and fastened by a thumbscrew to the lower part of\r\nthe stem of the disk. The oil cup is surrounded by a bath of water or\r\nhigh fire-test oil, according to the temperature at which it is desired\r\nto determine the viscosity. This temperature obtained, while the disk\r\nis resting on its supports, the wire is twisted 360° by rotating the\r\nmilled head at the top. The disk being released, the cylinder rotates\r\nin the oil by virtue of the torsion of the wire.\r\n\r\nThe action now observed is identical with that of the simple pendulum.\r\n\r\nIf there were no resistance to be overcome, the disk would return to\r\n0, and the momentum thus acquired would carry it 360° in the opposite\r\ndirection. But the resistance of the oil to the rotation of the\r\ncylinder causes the revolution to fall short of 360°, and the greater\r\nthe viscosity of the oil the greater will be the resistance, and also\r\nthe retardation. This retardation is found to be a very delicate\r\nmeasure of the viscosity of the oil.\r\n\r\nThis retardation may be read in a number of ways, but the simplest\r\nis to read directly the number of degrees of retardation between the\r\nfirst and second complete arcs covered by the rotating pendulum. For\r\nexample, suppose the wire be twisted 360° and the disk released so that\r\nrotation begins. In order to obtain an absolute reading to start from,\r\nwhich shall be independent of any slight error in adjustment, ignore\r\nthe starting point and make the first reading of the index at the end\r\nof the first swing. The disk is allowed to complete a vibration and\r\nthe needle is read again at its nearest approach to the first point\r\nread. The difference in the two readings will measure the retardation\r\ndue to the viscosity of the liquid. In order to eliminate errors\r\nduplicate determinations are made, the milled head being rotated in an\r\nopposite direction in the second one. The mean of the two readings will\r\nrepresent the true retardation. Each instrument is standardized in a\r\nsolution of pure cane sugar, as proposed by Babcock, and the viscosity,\r\nin each case, is a number representing the number of grams of sugar in\r\n100 cubic centimeters, which, at 22°, would produce the retardation\r\nnoted.\r\n\r\nEach instrument is accompanied by a table which contains the\r\nnecessary corrections for it and the number expressing the viscosity,\r\ncorresponding to the different degrees of retardation, as read on the\r\nindex. The following numbers, representing the viscosity of some oils\r\nas determined by the method of Doolittle, were obtained by Krug.[257]\r\n\r\n    Peanut     oil  48.50\r\n    Olive       ”   53.00\r\n    Cottonseed  ”   46.25\r\n    Linseed     ”   33.50\r\n\r\n=307. Microscopic Appearance.=—When fats are allowed to slowly\r\ncrystallize from an ethereal solution they may afford crystalline\r\nforms, which, when examined with a magnifying glass, yield valuable\r\nindications of the nature and origin of the substance under\r\nexamination.[258]\r\n\r\nThe method of securing fat crystals for microscopic examination, which\r\nhas been used in this laboratory, is as follows: From two to five\r\ngrams of the fat are placed in a test tube and dissolved in from ten\r\nto twenty cubic centimeters of ether. The tube is loosely stoppered\r\nwith cotton and allowed to stand, for fifteen hours or longer, in a\r\nmoderately warm room where no sudden changes of temperature are likely\r\nto take place. It is advisable to prepare several solutions of the same\r\nsubstance with varying properties of solvent, for it is not possible\r\nto secure in a given instance those conditions which produce the most\r\ncharacteristic crystals. The rate and time of the crystallization\r\nshould be such that the microscopic examination can take place when\r\nonly a small portion of the fat has separated in a crystalline\r\ncondition. A drop of the mass containing the crystals is removed by\r\nmeans of a pipette, placed on a slide, a drop of cotton or olive\r\noil added, a cover glass gently pressed down on the mixture and the\r\npreparation subjected to microscopic examination. Several slides should\r\nbe prepared from the same or different crystallizations. Sometimes the\r\nresults of an examination made in this way are very definite, but the\r\nanalyst must be warned not to expect definite data in all cases. Often\r\nthe microscopic investigations result in the production of negative or\r\nmisleading observations, and, at best, this method of procedure must be\r\nregarded only as helpful and confirmatory.\r\n\r\nA modification of the method of preparation described above has been\r\nsuggested by Gladding.[259] About five grams of the melted fat are\r\nplaced in a small erlenmeyer, dissolved in a mixture of ten cubic\r\ncentimeters of absolute alcohol mixed with half that quantity of ether.\r\nThe flask is stoppered with a plug of cotton and allowed to stand in a\r\ncool place for about half an hour. By this treatment the more easily\r\ncrystallizable portions of the fat separate in a crystalline form,\r\nwhile the triolein and its nearly related glycerids remain in solution.\r\nThe crystalline product is separated by filtration through paper wet\r\nwith alcohol and washed once with the solvent mentioned above. After\r\ndrying in the air for some time the crystals are removed from the paper\r\nand dissolved in twenty-five cubic centimeters of ether, the cotton\r\nplug inserted, and the erlenmeyer placed, in a standing position, in\r\na large beaker containing water. The water jacket prevents any sudden\r\nchanges of temperature and affords an opportunity for the uniform\r\nevaporation of the ether which should continue for fifteen hours or\r\nlonger in a cool place.\r\n\r\nOther solvents, _viz._, alcohol, chloroform, carbon disulfid, carbon\r\ntetrachlorid, petroleum and petroleum ether have been extensively used\r\nin the preparation of fat crystals for microscopic examination, but in\r\nour experience none of these is equal to ether when used as already\r\ndescribed.\r\n\r\n=308. Microscopic Appearance of Crystals of Fats.=—For an extended\r\nstudy and illustration of the characteristics of fat crystals the\r\nbulletin of the Division of Chemistry, already cited, may be consulted.\r\nIn the case of lard, there is a tendency, more or less pronounced, to\r\nform prismatic crystals with rhombic ends. Beef fat on the other hand\r\nshows a tendency to form fan-shaped crystals in which the radii are\r\noften curved.\r\n\r\nTypical crystals of swine and beef fat are shown in the accompanying\r\nfigures, 96 and 97.[260] In mixtures of swine and beef fats the typical\r\ncrystals are not always developed, but in most cases the fan-shaped\r\ncrystals of the beef fat will appear more or less modified when that\r\nfat forms twenty per cent or more of the mixture. When only five or\r\nten per cent of the beef fat on the one hand or a like amount of\r\nswine fat on the other are present the expectation of developing any\r\ncharacteristic crystals of the minimum constituent is not likely to be\r\nrealized.\r\n\r\nThe typical crystals of lard are thought by some experts to be palmitin\r\nand those of beef fat stearin, but no direct evidence has been adduced\r\nin support of these _a priori_ theories.\r\n\r\nIn the experience of this laboratory, as described by Crampton,[261]\r\nthe differences between the typical crystallization of beef and swine\r\nfats are plainly shown. In mixed fats, on the contrary, confusing\r\nobservations are often made. In a mixture of ten per cent of beef\r\nand ninety per cent of swine fats a uniform kind of crystallization\r\nis observed, not distinctly typical, but the characteristics of the\r\nlard crystals predominate. In many cases a positive identification\r\nof the crystals is only made possible by repeated crystallizations.\r\nIn the examination of so-called refined lards, which are mixtures of\r\nlard and beef fat, the form of aggregation of the crystals is found\r\nto resemble the fan-shaped typical forms of beef fat. When the single\r\ncrystals, however, are examined with a higher magnifying power, they\r\nare not found to be pointed but blunt, and some present the appearance\r\nof plates with oblique terminations, but not so characteristic as\r\nthose obtained from pure lard. In other cases in compound lards no\r\nbeef fat crystals are observed and these lards may have been made\r\npartly of cotton oil stearin. When a lard crystal presents its edge\r\nto observation it may readily escape identification, or may even be\r\nmistaken for a crystal of beef fat. In order to insure a side view the\r\ncover glass should be pressed down with a slight rotatory movement,\r\nwhereby some of the lard crystals at least may be made to present a\r\nside view.\r\n\r\n=309. Observation of Fat Crystals with Polarized Light.=—The\r\nappearance of fat crystals, when observed by means of polarized light\r\nalone or with the adjunct of a selenite plate, is often of value in\r\ndistinguishing the nature and origin of the sample.[262]\r\n\r\nEvery fat and oil which is amorphous will present the same set of\r\nphenomena when observed with polarized light through a selenite plate,\r\nbut when a fat has been melted and allowed to cool slowly the field of\r\nvision will appear mottled and particolored when thus examined. This\r\nmethod has been largely used in the technical examination of butter\r\nfor adulterants, and the microscope is extensively employed by the\r\nchemists of the Bureau of Internal Revenue for this purpose. In the\r\nexamination of the crystals of butter fat by polarized light a cross is\r\nusually observed when the nicols are turned at the proper angle, but\r\nthe cross, while almost uniformly seen with butter, is not distinctive,\r\nsince other fats often show it. These forms of crystals are best\r\nobtained by heating the butter fat to the boiling-point of water for\r\nabout a minute and then allowing it to slowly solidify, and stand for\r\ntwenty-four hours.\r\n\r\nPure butter, properly made, is never subjected to fusion, and hence,\r\nwhen examined through a selenite plate, presents a uniform field of\r\nvision similarly illuminated and tinted throughout. In oleomargarin,\r\nthe fats are sometimes, during their preparation, in a fused condition.\r\nThe field of vision is therefore filled to a greater or less extent\r\nwith crystals more or less perfect in form. Some of these crystals,\r\nbeing doubly refracting, will impart to a selenite field a mottled\r\nappearance. Such a phenomenon is therefore indicative of a fraudulent\r\nbutter or of one which has been at some time subjected to a temperature\r\nat or above its fusing point.\r\n\r\n=310. Spectroscopic Examination of Oils.=—The presence of chlorophyll\r\nor of its alteration products is a characteristic of crude oils of\r\nvegetable origin. In refined oils, even when of a vegetable origin,\r\nall traces of the chlorophyll products may disappear. The absorption\r\nbands given by oils are not all alike and in doubtful cases a suspected\r\nsample should be compared with one of known origin.\r\n\r\nIn conducting the examination, the oil in a glass vessel with parallel\r\nsides, is placed in front of the slit of the spectroscope and any\r\nabsorption band is located by means of the common divided scale and by\r\nthe color of the spectrum on which it falls. Olive and linseed oils\r\ngive three sharply defined absorption bands, a very dark one in the\r\nred, a faint one on the orange and a well marked one in the green.\r\n\r\nSesame, arachis, poppyseed and cottonseed oils also show absorption\r\nbands. Castor and almond oils do not affect the spectrum.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 96. LARD CRYSTALS × 65.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 97. REFINED LARD (BEEF FAT) CRYSTALS × 65.\r\n\r\nA. Hoen & Co., Lithocaustic.]\r\n\r\nRape and flaxseed oils absorb a part of the spectrum but do not affect\r\nthe rest of it. The spectroscope is of little practical utility in oil\r\nanalysis.[263]\r\n\r\n=311. Critical Temperature of Solution.=—The study of the critical\r\ntemperature of solution of oils has been made by Crismer, who finds it\r\nof value in analytical work.[264] If a fatty substance be heated under\r\npressure, with a solvent, _e. g._, alcohol, it will be noticed that as\r\nthe temperature rises the meniscus of separation of the two liquids\r\ntends to become a horizontal plane. If at this point the contents of\r\nthe tube be thoroughly mixed by shaking and then be left at rest, a\r\npoint will soon be reached at which the two liquids again separate,\r\nand this point is distinctly a function of temperature. Following\r\nis a description of a convenient method of determining the critical\r\ntemperature of the solution of fats and oils for experimental purposes.\r\nTubes are prepared for holding the reagents in such a way that, after\r\nthe introduction of the fat and alcohol, they can be easily sealed. The\r\ncapacity of these tubes should be about five cubic centimeters. They\r\nshould be charged with about one cubic centimeter of the dry filtered\r\nfat and about twice that quantity of ninety-five per cent alcohol.\r\nCare should be exercised to avoid touching the upper sides of the tube\r\nwith the reagents. When charged the tubes are sealed in the flame of\r\na lamp and attached to the bulb of a delicate thermometer in such a\r\nmanner as to have the surface of its liquid contents even with the top\r\nof the bulb. The tube is conveniently fastened to the thermometer by a\r\nplatinum wire. For duplicate determinations two tubes may be fastened\r\nto the same thermometric bulb. The apparatus thus prepared is placed in\r\na large vessel filled with strong sulfuric acid. The operator should\r\nbe careful to protect himself from the danger which might arise from\r\nan explosion of the sealed tubes during heating. It is advisable in\r\nall cases to observe the reaction through a large pane of clear glass.\r\nThe bath of sulfuric acid is heated by any convenient means and an\r\neven temperature throughout the mass is secured by stirring with the\r\nthermometer and its attachments. When the meniscus which separates\r\nthe two liquids becomes a horizontal plane the thermometer is removed\r\nand the liquid in the tubes well mixed until it appear homogeneous.\r\nThe thermometer is replaced in the bath, which is allowed to cool\r\nslowly, and the phenomena which take place in the sealed tubes are\r\ncarefully noted. The critical temperature of solution is that at which\r\nthe two liquids begin to separate. This moment is easily noted. It\r\nis, moreover, preceded by a similar phenomenon taking place in the\r\ncapillary part of the tube which retains a drop of the mixture on\r\nshaking. In this droplet an opalescence is first noted. In the mass of\r\nthe liquid this opalescence, a few seconds afterwards, is observed to\r\npermeate the whole, followed by the formation of zones and finally of\r\nthe reappearance of the meniscus of separation between the two liquids.\r\nThe temperature at this moment of opalescence preceding the separation\r\nof the liquid is the critical temperature of solution. With alcohol of\r\n0.8195 specific gravity, at 15°.5 (ninety-five per cent), the observed\r\ncritical temperatures for some of the more common fats and oils are as\r\ngiven below:\r\n\r\n    Butter fat     100°.0\r\n    Oleomargarin   125°.0\r\n    Peanut oil     123°.0\r\n    Cotton  ”      116°.0\r\n    Olive   ”      123°.0\r\n    Sesamé  ”      121°.0\r\n    Colza   ”      132°.5\r\n    Mutton tallow  116°.0\r\n    Beef marrow    125°.0\r\n    Nut oil        100°.5\r\n\r\nWhen the alcohol is not pure or if it be of a different density from\r\nthat named, the numbers expressing the critical temperature of solution\r\nwill vary from those given above.\r\n\r\n=312. Polarization.=—The pure glycerids are generally neutral to\r\npolarized light. In oils the degree of polarization obtained is often\r\nvariable, sometimes to the right and sometimes to the left. Olive oil,\r\nas a rule, shows a slight right hand polarization. Peanut, sesamé, and\r\ncottonseed oils vary in polarizing power, but in no case is it very\r\nmarked. Castor oil polarizes slightly to the right.\r\n\r\nIn determining the polarizing power of an oil it should be obtained in\r\na perfectly limpid state by filtration and observed through a tube of\r\nconvenient length, as a rule, 200 millimeters. The deviation obtained\r\nmay be expressed in divisions of the sugar scale of the instrument or\r\nin degrees of angular rotation.\r\n\r\n=313. Turbidity Temperature.=—The turbidity temperature of a fat, when\r\ndissolved in glacial acetic acid, as suggested by Valenta, may prove\r\nof some diagnostic value.[265] The fats are dissolved, with the aid of\r\nheat, in glacial acetic acid and, on slowly cooling, the temperature at\r\nwhich they become turbid is observed. The following data observed by\r\nJones are given for comparison.[266]\r\n\r\nThe numbers represent the turbidity temperature of the fat when treated\r\nwith the glacial acetic acid, and allowed to cool slowly. Butter fat,\r\nfrom 40° to 70°, mostly from 52° to 65°; oleomargarin, 95° to 106°;\r\nrape oil, 101°; sesamé oil, 77°; linseed oil, 53° to 57°; lard oil,\r\n96°; olive oil, 89°; peanut oil, 61° to 88°.\r\n\r\nIt is important in this test that the acetic acid be absolutely\r\nglacial. About three cubic centimeters of the glacial acetic acid, and\r\nthree of the fat, should be used.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHEMICAL PROPERTIES.\r\n\r\n=314. Solubility in Alcohol.=—As has already been noted, the glycerids\r\nare freely soluble in ether, chloroform, carbon bisulfid, acetone,\r\ncarbon tetrachlorid, and some other less commonly used solvents. Their\r\nsolubility in absolute alcohol is variable and the determination of its\r\ndegree may often be useful in analytical work.\r\n\r\nThe method used by Milliau for determining the degree of solubility\r\nis as follows:[267] The fatty matter is deprived of its free acids by\r\nshaking for half an hour with twice its volume of ninety-five per cent\r\nalcohol. After standing until the liquids are separated, the oil or fat\r\nis drawn off and washed three times with distilled water. The sample\r\nis deprived of water by filtering through a hot jacket filter and a\r\ngiven weight of the dry sample is well shaken with twice its weight of\r\nabsolute alcohol. A weighed portion of the alcoholic solution obtained\r\nis evaporated to remove the alcohol and the weight of the residual\r\nfat determined. From the data obtained the percentage of solubility\r\nis calculated. Olive oils, when treated as described above, show a\r\nsolubility of about forty-three parts per thousand of absolute alcohol,\r\ncotton oil sixty-two parts, sesamé forty-one parts, peanut sixty-six\r\nparts, colza twenty parts, and flaxseed seventy parts per thousand.\r\n\r\n=315. Coloration Produced by Oxidants.=—When oils and fats are mixed\r\nwith oxidizing reagents, such as sulfuric and nitric acids, the\r\nglycerids are partly decomposed with the production of colors which\r\nhave some analytical significance. The most simple method of applying\r\nthese tests is by the use of a thick porcelain plate provided with\r\nsmall cup-shaped depressions for holding the few drops of material\r\nrequired. Two or three drops of the oil under examination are placed\r\nin each of the cups, a like quantity of the oxidizing reagent added,\r\nand the mixture stirred with a small glass rod. The colors produced\r\nare carefully noted and the mixture is allowed to remain at room\r\ntemperature for at least twelve hours in order that the final tint may\r\nbe observed. The sulfuric acid used for this reaction should have a\r\nspecific gravity of one and seven-tenths and the nitric acid should\r\nhave the usual commercial strength of the strongest acid. Pure lard,\r\nwhen treated with sulfuric acid, as above described, shows but little\r\nchange of color while the vegetable oils mostly turn brown or black. In\r\naddition to the reagents mentioned many others, including sulfuric and\r\nnitric acids, sulfuric acid and potassium bichromate, chlorin, ammonia,\r\nhydrogen peroxid, sodium hydroxid and aqua regia are used. Only a few\r\nof these tests seem to have sufficient analytical importance to merit\r\nany detailed description.[268]\r\n\r\n=316. Coloration in Large Masses.=—Instead of applying the color test\r\nin the small way just described, larger quantities of the fat may\r\nbe used, either in the natural state or after solution in petroleum\r\nor other solvent. For this purpose about ten cubic centimeters of\r\nthe oil are shaken with a few drops of sulfuric acid or sulfuric and\r\nnitric acids. Lard, when thus treated (five drops of sulfuric acid to\r\nten cubic centimeters of lard) shows practically no coloration. When\r\ntreated with an equal volume of sulfuric acid and shaken, the lard on\r\nseparating has a brown-red tint.[269]\r\n\r\nOlive oil, with a few drops of sulfuric acid, gives a green color,\r\nwhile cottonseed, peanut and other vegetable oils, when thus treated\r\nwith sulfuric and nitric acids, show brown to black coloration. The\r\ndelicacy of the reaction may be increased by first dissolving the fat\r\nor oil in petroleum ether.\r\n\r\nIn the use of the coloration test with solvents, a convenient method\r\nis to dissolve about one cubic centimeter of the fat in a test tube in\r\npetroleum ether, add one drop of strong sulfuric acid and shake.\r\n\r\nIn the case of lard, the color does not change or becomes yellow\r\nor red. Cottonseed oil, similarly treated, shows a brown or black\r\ncolor.[270]\r\n\r\n=317. Special Nitric Acid Test.=—A special nitric acid test for\r\ncottonseed oil is made with nitric acid of exactly 1.375 specific\r\ngravity at 15°. This test is especially valuable in detecting\r\ncottonseed in olive oil. The operation is conveniently conducted by\r\nshaking together equal volumes of the oil and acid in a test tube until\r\nan intimate mixture or emulsion is secured. When any considerable\r\nquantity of cottonseed oil is present an immediate brown coloration\r\nis produced, from the intensity of which the relative proportion of\r\ncottonseed oil in the case of a mixture may be roughly approximated.\r\nWhen only a little cottonseed oil is present in the mixture, the test\r\ntube containing the reagents should be set aside for several hours\r\nbefore the final observation is made.\r\n\r\n=318. Coloration with Phosphomolybdic Acid.=—Among the color tests, one\r\nwhich we have found of use is the coloration produced in certain oils,\r\nmostly of a vegetable origin, by phosphomolybdic acid.[271]\r\n\r\nThe method of applying the test is extremely simple. A few cubic\r\ncentimeters of the oil or melted lard are dissolved in an equal volume\r\nof chloroform, and a third volume of ten per cent phosphomolybdic acid\r\nadded. The mouth of the test tube is closed with the thumb, and the\r\nwhole is violently shaken. On being left in repose, the phosphomolybdic\r\nacid gathers at the top, and the coloration produced therein is easily\r\nobserved. Cottonseed oil and peanut oil both give a beautiful green\r\nwhen treated in this way, which is turned to a blue on the addition of\r\nammonia. Linseed oil gives a green color, but forms a kind of emulsion\r\nwhich obscures the color to some extent. The pure lards rendered in\r\nthe laboratory give no coloration whatever to the reagent, but it\r\nretains its beautiful amber color in every case. Mixtures containing\r\nas little as ten per cent cottonseed oil and ninety per cent lard,\r\nshow a distinct greenish tint, while twenty per cent cottonseed oil\r\ngives a distinct green. This reaction, therefore, may be considered\r\nof great value, and on account of its easy application it should come\r\ninto wide use. But it is probable that different samples of cottonseed\r\noil, refined to different degrees or in different ways, vary in their\r\ndeportment with phosphomolybdic acid as they do with silver nitrate. In\r\nother words, there may be some samples of cottonseed oil which will not\r\ngive the green color when treated as above, or so faintly as to have no\r\ndiagnostic value in mixtures.\r\n\r\nThis reaction shows itself with nearly all vegetable oils but those\r\nwhich have been chemically treated either for the purpose of bleaching,\r\nor for the removal of the acidity, do not respond to the test at all,\r\nor else in a feeble manner, and that only after standing some time.\r\nLard, goose fat, tallow, deer fat, butter fat, etc., show no change in\r\ncolor on being treated with this reagent, either with or without the\r\naddition of alkali. The presence of a small quantity of vegetable oil\r\nbetrays itself by the appearance of the above mentioned coloration,\r\nthe intensity of which forms an approximate measure of the amount of\r\nvegetable oil present in the sample. In experiments with suspected\r\nlards, which deviated in their iodin absorption numbers from those of\r\ngenuine lard, the results were concordant, the color deepening as the\r\niodin figure rose. The mineral fats (paraffin, vaselin) are without\r\naction on this reagent, and the only animal fat which reduces it is\r\ncodliver oil.\r\n\r\nIn like manner some samples of lard may be found which exhibit a\r\ndeportment with this reagent similar to that shown with vegetable oils,\r\nand tallow and lard oil have been shown to give more distinct reactions\r\nthan some of the vegetable oils.[272]\r\n\r\nThe phosphomolybdic acid may be prepared by precipitating a solution\r\nof ammonium molybdate with sodium phosphate and dissolving the washed\r\nprecipitate in a warm solution of sodium carbonate. The solution is\r\nevaporated to dryness and the dry residue subjected to heat. If a blue\r\ncoloration be produced it may be discharged by adding a little nitric\r\nacid and reheating. The residue is dissolved in water, acidified with\r\nnitric and made of such a strength as to contain about ten per cent of\r\nthe substance.\r\n\r\n=319. Coloration with Picric Acid.=—If to ten cubic centimeters of oil\r\na cold saturated solution of picric acid in ether be added and the\r\nlatter be allowed to evaporate slowly, the acid remains dissolved in\r\nthe oil, to which it communicates a brown color.\r\n\r\nPure lard, after the evaporation of the ether, appears of a\r\ncitron-yellow color; if cottonseed oil be present, however, the mixture\r\nassumes a brown-red color.[273]\r\n\r\n=320. Coloration with Silver Nitrate.=—A modification of Bechi’s\r\nmethod of reducing silver nitrate, given further on, has been proposed\r\nby Brullé.[274] The reagent employed consists of twenty-five parts\r\nof silver nitrate in 1,000 parts of alcohol of ninety-five per cent\r\nstrength. Twelve cubic centimeters of the oil to be examined and five\r\nof the reagent are placed in a test tube, held in a vessel containing\r\nboiling water, and the ebullition continued for about twenty minutes.\r\nAt the end of this time an olive oil, even if it be an impure one,\r\nwill show a beautiful green tint. With seed oils the results are\r\nquite different. Cotton oil submitted to this treatment becomes\r\ncompletely black. Peanut oil shows at first a brown-red coloration and\r\nfinally a somewhat green tint, losing its transparency. Sesamé oil is\r\ndistinguished by a red-brown tint very pronounced and remaining red.\r\nColza oil takes on a yellowish green coloration, becomes turbid and is\r\neasily distinguished in its reaction from olive oil. In mixtures of\r\nolive oil with the other oils, any notable proportion of the seed oils\r\ncan be easily determined by the above reactions. Natural butter treated\r\nwith this reagent retains its primitive color. That containing margarin\r\nbecomes a brick-red and as little as five per cent of margarin in\r\nbutter can be detected by this test. With ten per cent the tint is very\r\npronounced.\r\n\r\n=321. Coloration with Stannic Bromid.=—This reagent is prepared by\r\nadding dry bromin, drop by drop, to powdered or granulated tin held in\r\na flask immersed in ice water, until a persistent red color indicates\r\nthat the bromin is in excess. In the application of this reagent three\r\nor four drops of it are added successively to a little less than that\r\nquantity of the oil, the mixture well stirred and set aside for a few\r\nminutes. The unsaponifiable matters of castor oil give a green color\r\nwhen thus treated, sandal wood oil a blood-red color and cedar oil a\r\npurplish color.[275]\r\n\r\n=322. Coloration with Auric Chlorid.=—The use of auric chlorid\r\nfor producing colorations in oils and fats was first proposed by\r\nHirschsohn.[276] One gram of auric chlorid is dissolved in 200 cubic\r\ncentimeters of chloroform and about six drops of this reagent added\r\nto five cubic centimeters of the oil to be tested. In the case of\r\ncottonseed oil a beautiful red color is produced.\r\n\r\nI have found that even pure lards give a trace of color sometimes with\r\nthis reagent, and therefore the production of a slight red tint cannot\r\nin all cases be regarded as conclusive of the presence of cottonseed\r\noil.[277]\r\n\r\nIn general, it may be said that the color reactions with fats and oils\r\nhave a certain qualitive and sorting value, and in any doubtful case\r\nthey should not be omitted. Their value can only be established by\r\ncomparison under identical conditions with a large number of fats and\r\noils of known purity. The analyst must not depend too confidingly on\r\nthe data found in books, but must patiently work out these reactions\r\nfor himself.\r\n\r\n=323. Thermal Reactions.=—The measurement of the heat produced by\r\nmixing glycerids with reagents which decompose them or excite other\r\nspeedy chemical reactions, gives valuable analytical data. These\r\nmeasurements may be made in any convenient form of calorimeter. The\r\ncontaining vessel for the reagents should be made of platinum or some\r\nother good conducting metal not affected by them.\r\n\r\nThe heat produced is measured in the usual way by the increment in\r\ntemperature noted in the mass of water surrounding the containing\r\nvessel. The determination of the heat produced in chemical reactions is\r\na tedious and delicate operation requiring special forms of apparatus\r\nfor different substances. The time element in these operations is\r\na matter of importance, since it is necessary to work in rooms\r\nsubject to slight changes of temperature and to leave the apparatus\r\nfor some time at rest, in order to bring it and its contents to a\r\nuniform temperature. For these reasons the more elaborate methods of\r\ncalorimetric examination are not well suited to ordinary analytical\r\nwork, and the reader is referred to standard works on thermal\r\nchemistry for the details of such operations.[278] For our purpose here\r\na description of two simple thermal processes, easily and quickly\r\nconducted, will be sufficient, while a description of the method of\r\ndetermining the heat of combustion of foods will be given in another\r\nplace.\r\n\r\n=324. Heat of Sulfuric Saponification.=—Maumené was the first to\r\nutilize the production of heat caused by mixing sulfuric acid with a\r\nfat as an analytical process.[279] In conducting the process a sulfuric\r\nacid of constant strength should be employed inasmuch as the rise of\r\ntemperature produced by a strong acid is much greater than when a\r\nweaker acid is employed. The process is at best only comparative and it\r\nis evident that the total rise of temperature in any given case depends\r\non the strength of the acid, the character, and purity of the fat or\r\noil, the nature of the apparatus and its degree of insulation, the\r\nmethod of mixing and the initial temperature. For this reason the data\r\ngiven by different analysts vary greatly.[280] For some of the methods\r\nof conducting the operation the reader may consult the work of Allen,\r\ncited above, or other authorities.[281]\r\n\r\nIn this laboratory the process is conducted as follows:[282] The initial\r\ntemperature of the reagents should be a constant one. For oils 20° is a\r\nconvenient starting point and for fats about 35°, at which temperature\r\nmost of them are soft enough to be easily mixed with the reagent. The\r\nacid employed should be the pure monohydrated form, specific gravity at\r\n20°, 1.845.\r\n\r\nThe apparatus used is shown in Fig. 98.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 98.—APPARATUS FOR DETERMINING RISE OF TEMPERATURE\r\nWITH SULFURIC ACID.]\r\n\r\nThe test tube which holds the reagents is twenty-four centimeters in\r\nlength and five in diameter. It is provided with a stopper having three\r\nperforations, one for a delicate thermometer, one for a bulb funnel\r\nfor delivering the sulfuric acid, and one to guide a stirring rod bent\r\ninto a spiral as shown. The thermometer is read with a magnifying\r\nglass. Fifty cubic centimeters of the fat are placed in the test tube\r\nand ten of sulfuric acid in the funnel and the apparatus is exposed\r\nat the temperature desired until all parts of it, together with the\r\nreagents, have reached the same degree. The test tube holding the oil\r\nshould be placed in a vacuum-jacket tube, such as will be described in\r\nparagraph =316=. The oil is allowed to run in as rapidly as possible\r\nfrom the funnel and the stirring rod is moved up and down two or three\r\ntimes until the oil and acid are well mixed. Care must be exercised\r\nto stir no more than is necessary for good mixing. The mercury is\r\nobserved as it ascends in the tube of the thermometer and its maximum\r\nheight is noted. With the glass it is easy to read to tenths, when\r\nthe thermometer is graduated in fifths of a degree. When oils are\r\ntested which produce a rise of temperature approaching 100°, in the\r\nabove circumstances, (cottonseed, linseed and some others) either\r\nsmaller quantities should be used or the oil diluted with some inert\r\nsubstance or dissolved in some inert solvent of high boiling point.\r\nFor a study of the variations produced in the rise of temperature when\r\nvarying proportions of oil and acid are used, the work of Munroe may be\r\nconsulted.[283]\r\n\r\nThe thermélaeometer described by Jean is a somewhat complicated piece\r\nof apparatus and does not possess any advantage over the simple form\r\ndescribed above.[284]\r\n\r\nInstead of expressing the data obtained in thermal degrees showing the\r\nrise of temperature, Thompson and Ballentyne refer them to the heat\r\nproduced in mixing sulfuric acid and water.[285]\r\n\r\nThe observed thermal degree of the oil and acid divided by that of\r\nthe water and acid is termed the specific temperature reaction.\r\nFor convenience in writing, this quotient is multiplied by 100.\r\nThe respective quantities of acid and water are ten and fifty\r\ncubic centimeters. This method of calculation has the advantage of\r\neliminating to a certain degree the variations which arise in the use\r\nof sulfuric acid of differing specific gravities. In the following\r\ntable are given the comparative data obtained for some common oils.[286]\r\n\r\n                  Acid of 95.4        Acid of 96.8        Acid of 99\r\n                     per cent.           per cent.            per cent.\r\n                /-----------------\\ /----------------\\  /--------------\\\r\n                  Rise of  Specific  Rise of  Specific  Rise of Specific\r\n                   temp.     temp.    temp.     temp.    temp.   temp.\r\n                   with    reaction.  with    reaction   with   reaction.\r\n    Kind of oil.  the oil.           the oil.           the oil.\r\n                     0°        0°       0°        0°       0°      0°\r\n\r\n    Olive oil       36.5       95     39.4       85       44.8      96\r\n    Rapeseed oil    49.0      127     37.0       89       58.0     124\r\n    Castor oil      34.0       88\r\n    Linseed oil    104.5      270                        125.2     269\r\n\r\n=325. Method of Richmond.=—The rise of temperature produced by\r\nmixing an oil and sulfuric acid is determined by Richmond in a simple\r\ncalorimeter, which is constructed by fitting a small deep beaker inside\r\na larger one with a packing of cotton. The heat capacity of the system\r\nis determined by adding to ten grams of water, in the inner beaker,\r\nat room temperature, twenty-five grams of water of a noted higher\r\ntemperature and observing the temperature of the mixture. The cooling\r\nof the system, during the time required for one determination of heat\r\nof sulfuric saponification, does not exceed one per cent of the whole\r\nnumber of calories produced.[287] Between the limits of ninety-two per\r\ncent and one hundred per cent the rise of temperature observed is\r\ndirectly proportional to the strength of the acid.\r\n\r\n_Relative Maumené Figure._—The total heat evolved per mean molecule is\r\ncalled by Richmond the relative maumené figure. It is calculated as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n    Let _x_ = percentage of sulfuric acid in the acid employed;\r\n        _h_ = heat capacity of calorimeter in grams of water;\r\n        _R_ = observed rise of temperature (twenty-five grams of\r\n                   oil, five cubic centimeters sulfuric acid);\r\n        _K_ = potash absorbed for saponification (19.5 per cent of\r\n                   potassium hydroxid, standard of comparison);\r\n        _M_ = relative maumené figure:\r\n\r\n                        21.5      20 + _h_    19.5\r\n    Then _M_ = _R_ × -----------× --------- × -----.\r\n                      _x_ - 78.5     20        _K_\r\n\r\n=326. Heat of Bromination.=—The rise of temperature caused by mixing\r\nfats with sulfuric acid has long been used to discriminate between\r\ndifferent fats and oils. Hehner and Mitchell propose a similar reaction\r\nbased upon the rise of temperature produced by mixing bromin with\r\nthe sample.[288] The action of bromin on unsaturated fatty bodies is\r\ninstantaneous and is attended with a considerable evolution of heat.\r\nSince the action of bromin on many of the oils is very violent it is\r\nnecessary to dilute the reagent with chloroform or glacial acetic acid.\r\nOwing to its high boiling point the acetic acid has some advantage\r\nover chloroform for this purpose. The tests are conveniently made in\r\na vacuum-jacket tube. In such a tube there is no loss of heat by\r\nradiation. The bromin is measured in a pipette having at its upper end\r\na tube filled with caustic lime held between plugs of asbestos. The\r\nbromin sample to be tested and the diluent employed are kept at the\r\nsame temperature before beginning the trial. They are quickly mixed\r\nand the rise of temperature noted. The oil is first dissolved in the\r\nchloroform and the bromin then added.\r\n\r\nA somewhat constant relation is noticed between the rise of temperature\r\nand the iodin number when one gram of oil, ten cubic centimeters of\r\nchloroform and one cubic centimeter of bromin are used.\r\n\r\nIf the rise in temperature in degrees be multiplied by 5.5 the product\r\nis approximately the iodin number of the sample. Thus a sample of lard\r\ngave a rise in temperature of 10°.6 and an iodin number of 57.15. The\r\nnumber obtained by multiplying 10.6 by 5.5 is 58.3.\r\n\r\nIn like manner the numbers obtained for some common oils are as follows:\r\n\r\n    Material.

Modification of the Heat of Bromination Method.=—The method\r\ndescribed above by Hehner and Mitchell presents many grave difficulties\r\nin manipulation, on account of the inconvenience of handling liquid\r\nbromin. The process is made practicable by dissolving both the oil or\r\nfat and the bromin in chloroform, or better in carbon tetrachlorid, in\r\nwhich condition the bromin solution is easily handled by means of a\r\nspecial pipette.[289]\r\n\r\nIn order to make a number of analyses of the same sample ten grams of\r\nthe fat may be dissolved in chloroform or carbon tetrachlorid and the\r\nvolume completed with the same solvent to fifty cubic centimeters.\r\nIn like manner twenty cubic centimeters of the bromin are dissolved\r\nin one of the solvents named and the volume completed to 100 cubic\r\ncentimeters therewith.\r\n\r\nFor convenience of manipulation the solutions are thus made of such a\r\nstrength that five cubic centimeters of each represent one gram of the\r\nfat and one cubic centimeter of the liquid bromin respectively.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 99. APPARATUS FOR DETERMINING HEAT OF BROMINATION.]\r\n\r\nThe apparatus used for the work is shown in the accompanying figure.\r\nThe pipette for handling the bromin solution is so arranged as to be\r\nfilled by the pressure of a rubber bulb, thus avoiding the danger of\r\nsucking the bromin vapor into the mouth. The filling is secured by\r\nkeeping the bromin solution in a heavy erlenmeyer with a side tubulure\r\nsuch as is used for filtering under pressure. The solutions are\r\nmixed in a long tube, held in a larger vessel, from which the air is\r\nexhausted to secure a minimum radiation of heat. A delicate thermometer\r\ngraduated in tenths serves to register the rise of temperature. The fat\r\nsolution is first placed in the test tube, with care not to pour it\r\ndown the sides of the tube but to add it by means of a pipette reaching\r\nnearly to the bottom. The whole apparatus having been allowed to come\r\nto a standard temperature the bromin solution is allowed to run in\r\nquickly from the pipette. No stirring is required as the liquids are\r\nsufficiently mixed by the addition of the bromin solution. The mercury\r\nin the thermometer rapidly rises and is read at its maximum point by\r\nmeans of a magnifying glass. With a thermometer graduated in tenths, it\r\nis easy to read to twentieths of a degree.\r\n\r\nIt is evident that the rise of temperature obtained depends on\r\nsimilar conditions to those mentioned in connection with sulfuric\r\nsaponification. Each system of apparatus must be carefully calibrated\r\nunder standard conditions and when this is done the comparative rise\r\nof temperature obtained with various oils and fats will prove of\r\ngreat analytical use. It is evident that the ratio of this rise of\r\ntemperature to the iodin number must be determined for every system of\r\napparatus and for every method of manipulation employed, and no fixed\r\nfactor can be given that will apply in every case.\r\n\r\nWith the apparatus above described and with the method of manipulation\r\ngiven the following data were obtained for the oils mentioned:\r\n\r\n                            Rise of temperature.\r\n    Olive oil                      20°.5\r\n    Refined cottonseed oil         25°.7\r\n    Sunflowerseed oil              28°.4\r\n    Calycanthusseed oil            29°.0\r\n\r\nBromin and chloroform, when mixed together, give off heat, due to\r\nthe chemical reaction resulting from the substitution of bromin for\r\nhydrogen in the chloroform molecule and the formation of hydrobromic\r\nacid. For this reason the data obtained, when chloroform is used as a\r\nsolvent, are slightly higher than with carbon tetrachlorid. The use of\r\nthe latter reagent is therefore to be preferred.\r\n\r\n=328. Haloid Addition Numbers.=—Many of the glycerids possess the\r\nproperty of combining directly with the haloids and forming thereby\r\ncompounds in which the haloid, by simple addition, has become a part of\r\nthe molecule. Olein is a type of this class of unsaturated glycerids.\r\nThe process may take place promptly as in the case of bromin or move\r\nslowly as with iodin. The quantity of the haloid absorbed is best\r\ndetermined in the residual matter and not by an examination of the fat\r\ncompound. By reason of the ease with which the amount of free iodin in\r\nsolution can be determined, this substance is the one which is commonly\r\nemployed in analytical operation on fats.\r\n\r\nIn general, the principle of the operation depends on bringing the fat\r\nand haloid together in a proper solution and allowing the addition\r\nto take place by simple contact. The quantity of the haloid in the\r\noriginal solution being known, the amount which remains in solution\r\nafter the absorption is complete, deducted from that originally\r\npresent, will give the quantity which has entered into combination with\r\nthe glycerid.\r\n\r\n=329. Hübl’s Process.=—In determining the quantity of iodin which\r\nwill combine with a fat, the method first proposed by Hübl, or some\r\nmodification thereof, is universally employed.[290] In the determination\r\nof the iodin number of a glycerid it is important that it be\r\naccomplished under set conditions and that iodid be always present\r\nin large excess. It is only when data are obtained in the way noted\r\nthat they can be regarded as useful for comparison and determination.\r\nMany modifications of Hübl’s process have been proposed, but it is\r\nmanifestly impracticable to give even a summary of them here. As\r\npracticed in the chemical laboratory of the Agricultural Department and\r\nby the Association of Official Agricultural Chemists, it is carried out\r\nas follows:[291]\r\n\r\n\r\n(1) PREPARATION OF REAGENTS.\r\n\r\n(_a_). _Iodin Solution._—Dissolve twenty-five grams of pure iodin in\r\n500 cubic centimeters of ninety-five per cent alcohol. Dissolve thirty\r\ngrams of mercuric chlorid in 500 cubic centimeters of ninety-five per\r\ncent alcohol. The latter solution, if necessary, is filtered, and then\r\nthe two solutions mixed. The mixed solution should be allowed to stand\r\ntwelve hours before using.\r\n\r\n(_b_). _Decinormal Sodium Thiosulfate Solution._—Dissolve 24.8 grams\r\nof chemically pure sodium thiosulfate, freshly pulverized as finely as\r\npossible and dried between filter or blotting paper, and dilute with\r\nwater to one liter, at the temperature at which the titrations are to\r\nbe made.\r\n\r\n(_c_). _Starch Paste._—One gram of starch is boiled in 200 cubic\r\ncentimeters of distilled water for ten minutes and cooled to room\r\ntemperature.\r\n\r\n(_d_). _Solution of Potassium Iodid._—One hundred and fifty grams of\r\npotassium iodid are dissolved in water and the volume made up to one\r\nliter.\r\n\r\n(_e_). _Solution of Potassium Bichromate._—Dissolve 3.874 grams of\r\nchemically pure potassium bichromate in distilled water and make the\r\nvolume up to one liter at the temperature at which the titrations are\r\nto be made.\r\n\r\n\r\n(2). DETERMINATION.\r\n\r\n(_a_). _Standardizing the Sodium Thiosulfate Solution._—Place twenty\r\ncubic centimeters of the potassium bichromate solution, to which have\r\nbeen added ten cubic centimeters of the solution of potassium iodid,\r\nin a glass stopper flask. Add to this mixture five cubic centimeters\r\nof strong hydrochloric acid. Allow the solution of sodium thiosulfate\r\nto flow slowly into the flask until the yellow color of the liquid\r\nhas almost disappeared. Add a few drops of the starch paste, and with\r\nconstant shaking continue to add the sodium thiosulfate solution until\r\nthe blue color just disappears. The number of cubic centimeters of\r\nthiosulfate solution used multiplied by five is equivalent to one gram\r\nof iodin.\r\n\r\n_Example._—Twenty cubic centimeters of potassium bichromate solution\r\nrequired 16.2 sodium thiosulfate; then 16.2 × 5 = 81 = number cubic\r\ncentimeters of thiosulfate solution equivalent to one gram of iodin.\r\nThen one cubic centimeter thiosulfate solution = 0.0124 gram of iodin:\r\n(Theory for decinormal solution of sodium thiosulfate, one cubic\r\ncentimeter = 0.0127 gram of iodin.)\r\n\r\n(_b_). _Weighing the Sample._—About one gram of butter fat is placed\r\nin a glass stopper flask, holding about 300 cubic centimeters, with\r\nthe precautions to be mentioned for weighing the fat for determining\r\nvolatile acids.\r\n\r\n(_c_). _Absorption of Iodin._—The fat in the flask is dissolved in ten\r\ncubic centimeters of chloroform. After complete solution has taken\r\nplace thirty cubic centimeters of the iodin solution (1) (_a_) are\r\nadded. The flask is now placed in a dark place and allowed to stand,\r\nwith occasional shaking, for three hours.\r\n\r\n(_d_). _Titration of the Unabsorbed Iodin._—One hundred cubic\r\ncentimeters of distilled water are added to the contents of the flask,\r\ntogether with twenty cubic centimeters of the potassium iodid solution.\r\nAny iodin which may be noticed upon the stopper of the flask should\r\nbe washed back into the flask with the potassium iodid solution. The\r\nexcess of iodin is taken up with the sodium thiosulfate solution, which\r\nis run in gradually, with constant shaking, until the yellow color of\r\nthe solution has almost disappeared. A few drops of starch paste are\r\nadded, and the titration continued until the blue color has entirely\r\ndisappeared. Toward the end of the reaction the flask should be\r\nstoppered and violently shaken, so that any iodin remaining in solution\r\nin the chloroform may be taken up by the potassium iodid solution in\r\nthe water. A sufficient quantity of sodium thiosulfate solution should\r\nbe added to prevent a reappearance of any blue color in the flask for\r\nfive minutes.\r\n\r\n(_e_). _Setting the Value of the Iodin Solution by the Thiosulfate\r\nSolution._—At the time of adding the iodin solution to the fat, two\r\nflasks of the same size as those used for the determination should be\r\nemployed for conducting the operation described above, but without the\r\npresence of any fat. In every other respect the performance of the\r\nblank experiments should be just as described. These blank experiments\r\nmust be made each time the iodin solution is used.\r\n\r\n_Example of Blank Determinations._—Thirty cubic centimeters of\r\niodin solution required 46.4 cubic centimeters of sodium thiosulfate\r\nsolution: Thirty cubic centimeters of iodin solution required 46.8\r\ncubic centimeters of sodium thiosulfate solution: Mean, 46.6 cubic\r\ncentimeters.\r\n\r\n    Weight of fat                              1.0479 grams\r\n    Quantity of iodin solution used           30.0    cubic centimeters\r\n    Thiosulfate equivalent to iodin used      46.6      ”        ”\r\n    Thiosulfate equivalent to remaining\r\n      iodin                                   14.7      ”        ”\r\n    Thiosulfate equivalent to iodin absorbed  31.9      ”        ”\r\n    Percent of iodin absorbed, 31.9 × 0.0124 × 100 ÷ 1.0479 = 37.75.\r\n\r\n=330. Character of Chemical Reaction.=—The exact nature of the chemical\r\nprocess which takes place in this reaction is not definitely known.\r\nHübl supposed that the products formed were chloro-iodid-additive\r\ncompounds, and he obtained a greasy product from oleic acid, to which\r\nhe ascribed the formula C₁₈H₃₄IClO₂. By others it is thought that\r\nchlorin alone may be added to the molecule.[292]\r\n\r\nIn general, it may be said that none of the glycerids capable\r\nof absorbing halogens is able to take on a quantity equivalent\r\nto theory.[293] While the saturated fatty acids (stearic series)\r\ntheoretically are not able to absorb iodin some of them are found to\r\ndo so to a small degree. It is evident, therefore, that it is not\r\npossible to calculate the percentage of unsaturated glycerids in a fat\r\nfrom their iodin number alone. According to the data worked out by\r\nSchweitzer and Lungwitz both addition and substitution of iodin take\r\nplace during the reaction.[294] This fact they determined by titration\r\nwith potassium iodate and iodid according to the formula 5HI + HIO₃ =\r\n6I + 6H₂O. The authors confess that whenever free hydriodic acid is\r\nfound in the mixture that iodin substitution has taken place and that\r\nfor each atom of hydrogen eliminated from the fat molecule two atoms\r\nof iodin disappear, one as the substitute and the other in the form\r\nof hydriodic acid. When carbon bisulfid or tetrachlorid is used as a\r\nsolvent no substitution takes place and pure additive compounds are\r\nformed.\r\n\r\nThe following process is recommended to secure a pure iodin addition\r\nto a glycerid: About one gram or a little less of the oil or fat is\r\nplaced in a glass stopper flask, to which are added about seven-tenths\r\nof a gram of powdered mercuric chlorid and twenty-five cubic\r\ncentimeters of a solution of iodin in carbon bisulfid. The stopper is\r\nmade tight by smearing it with powdered potassium iodid, tied down,\r\nand the mixture is heated for some time under pressure. By this method\r\nit is found that no hydriodic acid is formed, and hence all the iodin\r\nwhich disappears is added to the molecule of the glycerid. The additive\r\nnumbers obtained for some oils are appended:\r\n\r\n                     Time of                    Per cent      Per cent\r\n         Oil.        heating.

Solution in Carbon Tetrachlorid.=—Gantter has called attention\r\nto the fact that the amount of iodin absorbed by fat does not depend\r\nalone upon the proportion of iodin present but also upon the amount of\r\nmercuric chlorid in the solution.[295] Increasing amounts of mercuric\r\nchlorid cause uniformly a much greater absorption of the iodin.\r\nFor this reason he proposes to discard the use of mercuric chlorid\r\naltogether for the hübl test and to use a solvent which will at the\r\nsame time dissolve both the iodin and the fat. For this purpose he uses\r\ncarbon tetrachlorid. The solutions are prepared as follows:\r\n\r\n_Iodin Solution._—Ten grams of iodin are dissolved in one liter of\r\ncarbon tetrachlorid.\r\n\r\nIn the preparation of this solution the iodin must not be thrown\r\ndirectly into the flask before the addition of the tetrachlorid. Iodin\r\ndissolves very slowly in carbon tetrachlorid and the solution is made\r\nby placing it in a sufficiently large weighing glass and adding a\r\nportion of the carbon tetrachlorid thereto. The solution is facilitated\r\nby stirring with a glass rod until the added tetrachlorid is apparently\r\ncharged with the dissolved iodin. The dissolved portion is then poured\r\ninto a liter flask, new portions added to the iodin and this process\r\ncontinued until the iodin is completely dissolved, and then sufficient\r\nadditional quantities of the tetrachlorid are added to fill the flask\r\nup to the mark.\r\n\r\n=332. Sodium Thiosulfate Solution.=—Dissolve 19.528 grams of pure\r\nsodium thiosulfate in 1000 cubic centimeters of water. For determining\r\nthe strength of the solution by titration, the solution of iodin in\r\ncarbon tetrachlorid and a solution of sodium thiosulfate in water are\r\neach placed in a burette. A given volume of the iodin solution is\r\nfirst run into a flask with a glass stopper and afterward the sodium\r\nthiosulfate added little by little until, after a vigorous shaking,\r\nthe liquid has only a little color. Some solution of starch is then\r\nadded and shaken until the mixture becomes deep blue. The sodium\r\nthiosulfate solution is added drop by drop, with vigorous shaking after\r\neach addition, until the solution is completely decolorized. If both\r\nsolutions have been correctly made with pure materials they will be of\r\nequal strength; that is, ten cubic centimeters of the iodin solution\r\nwill be exactly decolorized by ten cubic centimeters of the sodium\r\nthiosulfate solution.\r\n\r\n=333. Method of Conducting the Absorption.=—The quantity of the fat\r\nor oil employed should range from 100 to 200 milligrams, according to\r\nthe absorption equivalent. These quantities should be placed in flasks\r\nwith glass stoppers in the ordinary way. In the flasks are placed\r\nexactly fifty cubic centimeters of the iodin solution equivalent to\r\n500 milligrams of iodin, and the flask is then stoppered and shaken\r\nuntil the fat or oil is completely dissolved. In order to avoid the\r\nvolatilization of the iodin finally, sufficient water is poured into\r\nthe flask to form a layer about one millimeter in thickness over the\r\nsolution containing the iodin and fat. The stopper should be carefully\r\ninserted and the flask allowed to stand at rest for fifty hours.\r\n\r\n=334. Estimation of the Iodin Number.=—This is determined in the usual\r\nway by titration of the amount of iodin left in excess after the\r\nabsorption as above described. The iodin number is to be expressed\r\nby the number of milligrams of iodin which are absorbed by each 100\r\nmilligrams of fat.\r\n\r\n_Example._—One hundred and one milligrams of flaxseed oil were\r\ndissolved in fifty cubic centimeters of the carbon tetrachlorid\r\nsolution of iodin and allowed to stand as above described for fifty\r\nhours. At the end of this time, 42.3 cubic centimeters of the sodium\r\nthiosulfate solution were required to decolorize the excess of iodin\r\nremaining.\r\n\r\n_Statement of Results._—Fifty cubic centimeters of the sodium\r\nthiosulfate equal 500 milligrams of iodin; therefore, 42.3 cubic\r\ncentimeters of the thiosulfate solution equal 423 milligrams of iodin.\r\nThe difference equals seventy-seven milligrams of iodin absorbed by 101\r\nmilligrams of the flaxseed oil. Therefore, the iodin number equivalent\r\nand the milligrams of iodin absorbed by 100 milligrams of flaxseed oil\r\nequal 76.2.\r\n\r\nIt is evident from the above determination that the iodin number of\r\nthe oil, when obtained in the manner described, is less than half that\r\nsecured by the usual hübl process. Since the solvent employed, however,\r\nis more stable than chloroform when in contact with iodin or bromin,\r\nthe proposed variation is one worthy of the careful attention of\r\nanalysts.\r\n\r\nMcIlhiney has called especial attention to the low numbers given by the\r\nmethod of Gantter, and from a study of the data obtained concludes that\r\niodin alone will not saturate glycerids, no matter what the solvents\r\nmay be.[296]\r\n\r\nIt is clear, therefore, that the process of Gantter cannot give numbers\r\nwhich are comparable with those obtained by the usual iodin method. Any\r\ncomparative value possessed by the data given by the process of Gantter\r\nmust be derived by confining it to the numbers secured by the carbon\r\ntetrachlorid process alone.\r\n\r\n=335. Substitution of Iodin Monochlorid for Hübl’s Reagent.=—Ephraim\r\nhas shown that iodin monochlorid may be conveniently substituted for\r\nthe hübl reagent with the advantage that it can be safely used at once,\r\nwhile the hübl reagent undergoes somewhat rapid changes when first\r\nprepared. The present disadvantage of the process is found in the fact\r\nthat the iodin monochlorid of commerce is not quite pure and each new\r\nlot requires to be titrated for the determination of its purity.\r\n\r\nThe reagent is prepared of such a strength as to contain 16.25 grams\r\nof iodin monochlorid per liter. The solvent used is alcohol. The\r\noperation is carried out precisely as in the hübl method, substituting\r\nthe alcoholic solution of iodin monochlorid for the iodin reagent\r\nproposed by Hübl.[297] If the iodin monochlorid solution, after acting\r\non the oil, be titrated without previous addition of potassium iodid a\r\nnew value is obtained, the chloriodin number. In titrating, the sodium\r\nthiosulfate is added until the liquid, which is made brown by the\r\nseparated iodin, becomes yellow. At this point the solution is diluted,\r\nstarch paste added, and the titration completed.\r\n\r\n=336. Preservation of the Hübl Reagent.=—To avoid the trouble due to\r\nchanges in the strength of Hübl’s reagent, Mahle adds hydrochloric acid\r\nto it at the time of its preparation.[298] The reagent is prepared as\r\nfollows: Twenty-five grams of iodin dissolved in a quarter of a liter\r\nof ninety-five per cent alcohol are mixed with the same quantity of\r\nmercuric chlorid in 200 cubic centimeters of alcohol, the same weight\r\nof hydrochloric acid of 1.19 specific gravity added and the volume of\r\nthe mixture completed to half a liter with alcohol. After five days\r\nsuch a solution gave, on titration, 49.18 instead of 49.31 grams per\r\nliter of iodin.\r\n\r\nIt will be observed that this solution is double the usual strength,\r\nbut this does not influence the accuracy of the analytical data\r\nobtained. It appears that the hübl number is not, therefore, an iodin\r\nnumber, but expresses the total quantity of iodin, chlorin and oxygen\r\nabsorbed by the fat during the progress of the reaction.\r\n\r\n=337. Bromin Addition Number.=—In the process of Hübl and others an\r\nattempt is made to determine the quantity of a halogen, _e.g._, iodin,\r\nwhich the oil, fat or resin will absorb under certain conditions.\r\nThe numbers obtained, however, represent this absorption only\r\napproximately, because the halogen may disappear through substitution\r\nas well as absorption. Whether or not a halogen is added, _i. e._,\r\nabsorbed or substituted, may be determined experimentally.\r\n\r\nThe principle on which the determination depends rests on the fact that\r\na halogen, _e. g._, bromin, forms a molecule of hydrobromic acid for\r\nevery atom of bromin substituted, while in a simple absorption of the\r\nhalogen no such action takes place. If, therefore, bromin be brought\r\ninto contact with a fat, oil or resin, the determination of the\r\nquantity of hydrobromic acid formed will rigidly determine the quantity\r\nof bromin substituted during the reaction. If this quantity be deducted\r\nfrom the total bromin which has disappeared, the relative quantities of\r\nthe halogen added and substituted are at once determined. In the method\r\nof McIlhiney[299] bromin is used instead of iodin because the addition\r\nfigures of iodin are in general much too low.\r\n\r\n_The Reagents._—The following solutions are employed:\r\n\r\n1. One-third normal bromin dissolved in carbon tetrachlorid:\r\n\r\n2. One-tenth normal sodium thiosulfate:\r\n\r\n3. One-tenth normal potassium hydroxid.\r\n\r\n_The Manipulation._—From a quarter to one gram of the fat, oil or\r\nresin, is dissolved in ten cubic centimeters of carbon tetrachlorid\r\nin a dry bottle of 500 cubic centimeters capacity, provided with a\r\nwell-ground glass stopper. An excess of the bromin solution is added,\r\nthe bottle tightly stoppered, well shaken and placed in the dark. At\r\nthe end of eighteen hours the bottle is placed in a freezing mixture\r\nand cooled until a partial vacuum is formed. A piece of wide rubber\r\ntubing an inch and a half long is slipped over the lip of the bottle so\r\nas to form a well about the stopper. This well having been filled with\r\nwater the stopper is lifted and the water is sucked into the bottle\r\nabsorbing all the hydrobromic acid which has been formed. The well\r\nshould be kept filled with water, as it is gradually taken in until in\r\nall twenty-five cubic centimeters have been added. The bottle is next\r\nwell shaken and from ten to twenty cubic centimeters of a twenty per\r\ncent potassium iodid solution added.\r\n\r\nThe excess of bromin liberates a corresponding amount of iodin, which\r\nis determined by the thiosulfate solution in the usual way, after\r\nadding about seventy-five cubic centimeters of water. The total bromin\r\nwhich has disappeared is then calculated from the data obtained,\r\nthe strength of the original bromin solution having been previously\r\ndetermined. The contents of the bottle are next transferred to a\r\nseparatory funnel, the aqueous portion separated, filtered through a\r\nlinen filter, a few drops of thiosulfate solution added, if a blue\r\ncolor persist, and the free hydrobromic acid determined by titration\r\nwith potassium hydroxid, using methyl orange as indicator. The end\r\nreaction is best observed by placing the solution in a porcelain\r\ndish, adding the alkali in slight excess, and titrating back with\r\ntenth-normal hydrochloric acid until the pink tint is perceived.\r\nFrom the number of cubic centimeters of alkali used the amount of\r\nbromin present as hydrobromic acid is calculated, and this expressed\r\nas percentage gives the bromin substitution figure. The bromin\r\nsubstitution figure multiplied by two and subtracted from the total\r\nabsorption gives the addition figure.\r\n\r\nFollowing are the data for some common substances:\r\n\r\n                    Total bromin\r\n                    absorption in   Bromin addition  Bromin substitution\r\n      Substance.   eighteen hours.     figure.          figure.\r\n    Rosin             212.70            0.00           106.35\r\n    Raw linseed oil   102.88          102.88            00.00\r\n    Boiled ”     ”    103.92          103.92            00.00\r\n    Salad cotton ”     65.54           64.26             0.64\r\n    Sperm        ”     56.60           54.52             1.04\r\n\r\nBy the process just described it is possible to detect mixtures of\r\nrosins and rosin oils with animal and vegetable oils. In this respect\r\nit possesses undoubted advantages over the older methods.\r\n\r\n=338. Method Of Hehner.=—The absorption of bromin which takes place\r\nwhen unsaturated fats are brought into contact with that reagent was\r\nmade the basis of an analytical process, proposed by Allen as long\r\nago as 1880.[300] In the further study of the phenomena of bromin\r\nabsorption, as indicated by McIlhiney, Hehner modified the method as\r\nindicated below.[301] From one to three grams of the sample are placed\r\nin a tared wide-mouthed flask and dissolved in a little chloroform.\r\nBromin is added to the solution, drop by drop, until it is in decided\r\nexcess. The flask is placed on a steam-bath and heated until the\r\ngreater part of the bromin is evaporated, when some more chloroform is\r\nadded and the heating continued until all the free bromin has escaped.\r\nThe flask is put in a bath at 125° and dried to constant weight. A\r\nlittle acrolein and hydrobromic acid escape during the drying and the\r\nresidue may be colored, or a heavy bromo oil be obtained. The gain\r\nin weight represents the bromin absorbed. The bromin number may be\r\nconverted into the iodin number by multiplying by 1.5875.[302]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 100.—OLEIN TUBE.]\r\n\r\n=339. Halogen Absorption and Addition of Fat Acids.=—Instead of\r\nemploying the natural glycerids for determining the degree of action\r\nwith the halogens the acids may be separated by some of the processes\r\nof saponification hereafter described and used as directed for the\r\nglycerids themselves. It is doubtful if any practical advantage arises\r\nfrom this variation of the process. If the fat acids be separated,\r\nhowever, it is possible to get some valuable data from the halogen\r\nabsorption of the fractions. Theoretically the stearic series of acids\r\nwould suffer no change in contact with halogens while the oleic series\r\nis capable of a maximum absorptive and additive action. On this fact is\r\nbased a variation of the iodin process in which an attempt is made to\r\nseparate the oleic acid from its congeners and to apply the halogen to\r\nthe separated product.\r\n\r\nThe method of separation devised by Muter is carried out as\r\nfollows:[303] The separatory or olein tube consists of a wide burette\r\nstem, provided with a lateral stopcock, and drawn out below to secure a\r\nclamp delivery tube, and at the top expanded into a bulb closed with a\r\nground glass stopper, as shown in Fig. 100. Forty cubic centimeters of\r\nliquid are placed in the tube and the surface is marked 0. Above this\r\nthe graduation is continued in cubic centimeters to 250, which figure\r\nis just below the bulb at the top.\r\n\r\nThe process of analysis is conducted as follows: About three grams of\r\nthe oil or fat are placed in a flask, with fifty cubic centimeters of\r\nalcoholic potash lye, containing enough potassium hydroxid to ensure\r\ncomplete saponification. The flask is closed and heated on a water-bath\r\nuntil saponification is complete. The pressure flask to be described\r\nhereafter may be conveniently used. After cooling, the excess of alkali\r\nis neutralized with acetic acid in presence of phenolphthalien and then\r\nalcoholic potash added until a faint pink color is produced. In a large\r\nporcelain dish place 200 cubic centimeters of water and thirty of a ten\r\nper cent solution of lead acetate and boil. Pour slowly, with constant\r\nstirring, into the boiling liquid the soap solution prepared as above\r\ndescribed, and allow to cool, meanwhile continuing the stirring. At the\r\nend, the liquid remaining is poured off and the solid residue washed\r\nwith hot water by decantation.\r\n\r\nThe precipitate of lead salts is finally removed from the dish into a\r\nstoppered bottle, the dish washed with pure ether, the washings added\r\nto the bottle together with enough ether to make the total volume\r\nthereof 120 cubic centimeters. The closed bottle is allowed to stand\r\nfor twelve hours with occasional shaking, by which time the lead oleate\r\nwill have been completely dissolved. The insoluble lead salts are next\r\nseparated by filtration, and the filtrate collected in the olein tube.\r\nThe washing is accomplished by ether and, to avoid loss, the funnel\r\nis covered with a glass plate. The ethereal solution of lead oleate\r\nis decomposed by dilute hydrochloric acid, using about forty cubic\r\ncentimeters of a mixture containing one part of strong acid to four\r\nof water. The olein tube is closed and shaken until the decomposition\r\nis complete, which will be indicated by the clearing of the ethereal\r\nsolution. The tube is allowed to remain at rest until the liquids\r\nseparate and the aqueous solution is run out from the pinch-cock at the\r\nlower end. The residue is washed with water by shaking, the water drawn\r\noff as just described, and the process continued until all acidity is\r\nremoved.\r\n\r\nWater is then added until the separating plane between the two liquids\r\nis at the zero of the graduation, and enough ether added to make the\r\nethereal solution of a desired volume, say 200 cubic centimeters. After\r\nwell mixing, the ethereal solution or an aliquot part thereof, _e.g._,\r\nfifty cubic centimeters, is removed by the side tubulure and nearly\r\nthe whole of the ether removed from the portion by distillation. To\r\nthe residue are added fifty cubic centimeters of pure alcohol and the\r\nsolution is titrated for oleic acid with decinormal sodium hydroxid\r\nsolution. Each cubic centimeter of the hydroxid solution used is\r\nequivalent to 0.0282 gram of oleic acid. The total quantity of oleic\r\nacid contained in the amount of fat used is readily calculated from the\r\ndata obtained.\r\n\r\nTo determine the iodin absorption of the free acid another measured\r\nquantity of the ethereal solution containing as nearly as possible half\r\na gram of oleic acid, is withdrawn from the olein tube, and the ether\r\nremoved in an atmosphere of pure carbon dioxid. To the residue, without\r\nallowing it to come in contact with the air, fifty cubic centimeters\r\nof Hübl’s reagent are added and the flask put aside in the dark for\r\ntwelve hours. At the end of this time thirty-five cubic centimeters of\r\na ten per cent solution of potassium iodid are added, the contents of\r\nthe flask made up to a quarter of a liter with water, fifteen cubic\r\ncentimeters of chloroform added, and the excess of iodin titrated\r\nin the way already described. The percentage of iodin absorbed is\r\ncalculated as already indicated.\r\n\r\nLane has proposed a more rapid process for the above determination.[304]\r\nThe lead soaps are precipitated in a large erlenmeyer and cooled\r\nrapidly in water, giving the flask meanwhile a circular motion which\r\ncauses the soaps to adhere to its walls. Wash with hot water, rinsing\r\nonce with alcohol, add 120 cubic centimeters of ether, attach a reflux\r\ncondenser, and boil until the lead oleate is dissolved, cool slowly, to\r\nallow any lead stearate which has passed into solution to separate, and\r\nfilter into the olein tube. The rest of the operation is conducted as\r\ndescribed above. The percentage of oleic acid and its iodin absorption\r\nin the following glycerids are given in the table below:\r\n\r\n                            Cottonseed oil.   Lard.   Peanut oil.\r\n    Per cent oleic acid         75.16         64.15     79.84\r\n    Per cent iodin absorbed    141.96         99.48    114.00\r\n\r\n=340. Saponification.=—In many of the analytical operations which are\r\nconducted on the glycerids it is necessary to decompose them. When this\r\nis accomplished by the action of a base which displaces the glycerol\r\nfrom its combination with the fat acids, the resulting salts are known\r\nas soaps and the process is named saponification. In general use the\r\nterm saponification is applied, not only strictly, as above defined,\r\nbut also broadly, including the setting free of the glycerol either by\r\nthe action of strong acids or by the application of superheated steam.\r\nIn chemical processes the saponification of a glycerid is almost\r\nalways accomplished by means of soda or potash lye. This may be in\r\naqueous or alcoholic solution and the process is accomplished either\r\nhot or cold, in open vessels or under pressure. It is only important\r\nthat the alkali and glycerid be brought into intimate contact. The\r\nrate of saponification is a function of the intimacy of contact, the\r\nnature of the solvent and the temperature. For chemical purposes, it\r\nis best that the decomposition of the glycerid be accomplished at a\r\nlow temperature and for most samples this is secured by dissolving the\r\nalkali in alcohol.\r\n\r\nIn respect of solvents, that one would be most desirable, from\r\ntheoretical considerations, which acts on both the glycerids and\r\nalkalies. In the next rank would be those which dissolve one or the\r\nother of the materials and are easily miscible, as, for instance,\r\ncarbon tetrachlorid for the glycerid and alcohol for the alkali.\r\nAs a rule, the glycerid is not brought into solution before the\r\nsaponification process is commenced. Instead of using an alcoholic\r\nsolution of sodium or potassium hydroxid the sodium or potassium\r\nalcoholate may be employed, made by dissolving metallic sodium or\r\npotassium in alcohol. It is probable, however, that a little water is\r\nalways necessary to complete the process.\r\n\r\nIf a fat be dissolved in ether and treated with sodium alcoholate,\r\na granular deposit of soap is soon formed and the saponification is\r\ncompleted in twenty-four hours. As much as 150 grams of fat can be\r\nsaponified with ten grams of metallic sodium dissolved in 250 cubic\r\ncentimeters of absolute alcohol.[305] For practical purposes the\r\nalcoholic solution of the hydroxid is sufficient.\r\n\r\nThe chemical changes which fats undergo on saponification are of a\r\nsimple kind. When the process is accomplished by means of alkalies,\r\nthe alkaline base takes the place of the glycerol as indicated in the\r\nfollowing equation:\r\n\r\n      Triolein 884.          Potassium hydroxid 168.\r\n       C₃H₅(O.C₁₈H₃₃O)₃   +      3KOH                =\r\n\r\n              Potassium oleate 960.     Glycerol 92.\r\n                 (KO.C₁₈H₃₃O)₃      +     C₃H₅(OH)₃.\r\n\r\nThe actual changes which take place in ordinary saponification are\r\nnot so simple, however, since natural glycerids are mixtures of\r\nseveral widely differing fats, each of which has its own rate of\r\ndecomposition. Palmitin and stearin, for instance, are saponified more\r\nreadily than olein and some of the saponifiable constituents of resins\r\nand waxes are extremely resistant to the action of alkalies. The above\r\nequation may be regarded as typical for saponification in aqueous or\r\nalcoholic solutions in open dishes or under pressure. If the alkali\r\nused be prepared by dissolving metallic sodium or potassium in absolute\r\nalcohol (sodium alcoholate or ethoxid) the reaction which takes place\r\nis probably represented by the equation given below:\r\n\r\n    C₃H₅(O.C₁₈H₃₃O)₃ + 3C₂H₅.ONa = C₃H₅(ONa)₃ + 3C₁₈H₃₃O.O.C₂H₅,\r\n\r\nin which it is seen that complete saponification cannot occur without\r\nthe absorption of some water, by which the sodium glyceroxid is\r\nconverted into glycerol and sodium hydroxid, the latter compound\r\neventually uniting with the ethyl ether of the fat acid.[306]\r\n\r\nGlycerids are decomposed when heated with water under a pressure of\r\nabout sixteen atmospheres or when subjected to a current of superheated\r\nsteam at 200°. The reaction consists in the addition of the elements\r\nof water, whereby the glyceryl radicle is converted into free glycerol\r\nand the fat acid is set free. The chemical change which ensues is shown\r\nbelow:\r\n\r\n    C₃H₅(O.C₁₈H₃₃O)₃ + 3H₂O = 3C₁₈H₃₄O₂ + C₃H₅(OH)₃.\r\n\r\nThe details of saponification with sulfuric acid are of no interest\r\nfrom an analytical point of view.[307]\r\n\r\n=341. Saponification in an Open Dish.=—The simplest method of\r\nsaponifying fats is to treat them with the alkaline reagent in an\r\nopen dish. In all cases the process is accelerated by the application\r\nof heat. Vigorous stirring also aids the process by securing a more\r\nintimate mixture of the ingredients. This method of decomposing\r\nglycerids, however, is not applicable in cases where volatile ethers\r\nmay be developed. These ethers may escape saponification and thus\r\nprevent the formation of the maximum quantity of soap. While not suited\r\nto exact quantitive work, the method is convenient in the preparation\r\nof fat acids which are to be the basis of subsequent analytical\r\noperations, as, for instance, in the preparation of fat acids for\r\ntesting with silver nitrate. Large porcelain dishes are conveniently\r\nused and the heat is applied in any usual way, with care to avoid\r\nscorching the fat.\r\n\r\n=342. Saponification under Pressure.=—The method of saponification\r\nwhich has given the best satisfaction in my work and which has been\r\nadopted by the Association of Official Agricultural Chemists is\r\ndescribed below.[308]\r\n\r\n_Reagents._—The reagents employed are a solution of pure potash\r\ncontaining 100 grams of the hydroxid dissolved in fifty-eight grams of\r\nrecently boiled distilled water, alcohol of approximately ninety-five\r\nper cent strength redistilled over caustic soda, and sodium hydroxid\r\nsolution prepared as follows:\r\n\r\nOne hundred grams of sodium hydroxid are dissolved in 100 cubic\r\ncentimeters of distilled water. The caustic soda should be as free as\r\npossible from carbonates, and be preserved from contact with the air.\r\n\r\n_Apparatus._—A saponification flask; it has a round bottom and a ring\r\nnear the top, by means of which the stopper can be tied down. The flask\r\nis arranged for heating as shown in Fig. 101. A pipette graduated to\r\ndeliver forty cubic centimeters is recommended as being more convenient\r\nthan a burette for measuring the solutions: A pipette with a long stem\r\ngraduated to deliver 5.75 cubic centimeters at 50°.\r\n\r\n_Manipulation._—The fat to be examined should be melted and kept in a\r\ndry warm place at about 60° for two or three hours, until the water\r\nhas entirely separated. The clear supernatant fat is poured off and\r\nfiltered through a dry filter paper in a jacket funnel containing\r\nboiling water. Should the filtered fat, in a fused state, not be\r\nperfectly clear, it must be filtered a second time. The final drying is\r\naccomplished at 100° in a thin layer in a flat bottom dish, in partial\r\nvacuum or an atmosphere of inert gas.\r\n\r\nThe saponification flasks are prepared by thoroughly washing with\r\nwater, alcohol, and ether, wiping perfectly dry on the outside,\r\nand heating for one hour at the temperature of boiling water. The\r\nhard flasks used in moist combustions with sulfuric acid for the\r\ndetermination of nitrogen are well suited for this work. The flasks\r\nshould be placed in a tray by the side of the balance and covered with\r\na silk handkerchief until they are perfectly cool. They must not be\r\nwiped with a silk handkerchief within fifteen or twenty minutes of the\r\ntime they are weighed or else the electricity developed will interfere\r\nwith weighing. The weight of the flasks having been accurately\r\ndetermined, they are charged with the melted fat in the following way:\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 101.—APPARATUS FOR SAPONIFYING UNDER PRESSURE.]\r\n\r\nThe pipette with a long stem, marked to deliver 5.75 cubic centimeters,\r\nis warmed to a temperature of about 50°. The fat, having been poured\r\nback and forth once or twice into a dry beaker in order to thoroughly\r\nmix it, is taken up in the pipette, the nozzle of the pipette having\r\nbeen previously wiped to remove any externally adhering fat, is carried\r\nto near the bottom of the flask and 5.75 cubic centimeters of fat\r\nallowed to flow into the flask. After the flasks have been charged\r\nin this way they should be re-covered with the silk handkerchief and\r\nallowed to stand for fifteen or twenty minutes, when they are again\r\nweighed.\r\n\r\n=343. Methods of Saponification.=—_In the Presence of Alcohol._—Ten\r\ncubic centimeters of ninety-five per cent alcohol are added to the fat\r\nin the flask, and then two cubic centimeters of the sodium hydroxid\r\nsolution. A soft cork stopper is inserted and tied down with a piece\r\nof twine. The saponification is completed by placing the flask upon\r\nthe water or steam-bath. The flask during the saponification, which\r\nshould last one hour, should be gently rotated from time to time, being\r\ncareful not to project the soap for any distance up its sides. At the\r\nend of an hour the flask, after having been cooled to near the room\r\ntemperature, is opened.\r\n\r\n_Without the Use of Alcohol._—To avoid the danger of loss from the\r\nformation of ethers, and the trouble of removing the alcohol after\r\nsaponification, the fat may be saponified with a solution of caustic\r\npotash in a closed flask without using alcohol. The operation is\r\ncarried on exactly as indicated above for saponification in the\r\npresence of alcohol, using potassium instead of sodium hydroxid\r\nsolution. For the saponification, use two cubic centimeters of the\r\npotassium hydroxid solution which are poured on the fat after it has\r\nsolidified in the flask. Great care must be taken that none of the\r\nfat be allowed to rise on the sides of the saponifying flask to a\r\npoint where it cannot be reached by the alkali. During the process of\r\nsaponification the flask can only be very gently rotated in order to\r\navoid the difficulty mentioned. This process is not recommended with\r\nany apparatus except a closed flask with round bottom. Potash is used\r\ninstead of soda so as to form a softer soap and thus allow a more\r\nperfect saponification.\r\n\r\nThe saponification may also be conducted as follows: The alkali and fat\r\nin the melted state are shaken vigorously in the saponification flask\r\nuntil a complete emulsion is secured. The rest of the operation is then\r\nconducted as above.\r\n\r\n=344. Saponification in the Cold.=—By reason of the danger of loss\r\nfrom volatile ethers in the hot alcoholic saponification, a method\r\nfor successfully conducting the operation in the cold is desirable.\r\nSuch a process has been worked out by Henriques.[309] It is based\r\nupon the previous solution of the fat in petroleum ether, in which\r\ncondition it is so easily attacked by the alcoholic alkali as to make\r\nthe use of heat during the saponification unnecessary. The process is\r\nconveniently conducted in a porcelain dish covered with a watch glass.\r\nFive grams of the fat are dissolved in twenty-five cubic centimeters\r\nof petroleum ether and treated with an equal quantity of four per cent\r\nalcoholic soda lye. The process of saponification begins at once and\r\nis often indicated by the separation of sodium salts. It is best to\r\nallow the action to continue over night and, with certain difficultly\r\nsaponifiable bodies, such as wool fat and waxes, for twenty-four hours.\r\nIn the case of butter fat an odor of butyric ether may be perceived at\r\nfirst but it soon disappears. After the saponification is complete,\r\nthe excess of alkali is determined by titration in the usual way with\r\nset hydrochloric acid, using phenolphthalien as indicator. For the\r\ndetermination of volatile acids, the mixture, after saponification is\r\ncomplete, is evaporated rapidly to dryness, the solid matter being\r\nreduced to powder with a glass rod, after which it is transferred\r\nto a distilling flask and the volatile acids secured by the usual\r\nprocesses. In comparison with the saponification and reichert-meissl\r\nnumbers obtained with hot alcoholic potash, the numbers given by the\r\ncold process are found to be slightly higher with those fats which give\r\neasily volatile ethers. On account of the simplicity of the process\r\nand the absence of danger of loss from ethers, it is to be recommended\r\ninstead of the older methods in case a more extended trial of it should\r\nestablish the points of excellence claimed above.\r\n\r\n=345. Saponification Value.=—The number of milligrams of potassium\r\nhydroxid required to completely saturate one gram of a fat is known as\r\nthe saponification value of the glycerid. The process of determining\r\nthis value, as worked out by Koettstorfer and modified in the\r\nlaboratory of the Department of Agriculture, is as follows:[310]\r\n\r\nThe saponification is accomplished with the aid of potassium hydroxid\r\nand in the flask and manner described in the preceding paragraph. About\r\ntwo grams of the fat will be found a convenient quantity. Great care\r\nmust be exercised in measuring the alkaline solution, the same pipette\r\nbeing used in each case and the same time for draining being allowed in\r\nevery instance. Blanks are always to be conducted with each series of\r\nexaminations. As soon as the saponification is complete, the flask is\r\nremoved from the bath, allowed to cool and its contents are titrated\r\nwith seminormal hydrochloric acid and phenolphthalien as indicator.\r\nThe number expressing the saponification value is obtained by\r\nsubtracting the number of cubic centimeters of seminormal hydrochloric\r\nacid required to neutralize the alkali after saponification from\r\nthat required to neutralize the alkali of the blank determinations,\r\nmultiplying the result by 28.06 and dividing the product by the number\r\nof grams of fat employed.\r\n\r\n_Example._—Weight of sample of fat used 1.532 grams: Number of cubic\r\ncentimeters half normal hydrochloric acid required to saturate blank,\r\n22.5: Number of cubic centimeters of half normal hydrochloric acid\r\nrequired to saturate the alkali after saponification 12.0: Difference,\r\n10.5 cubic centimeters:\r\n\r\nThen 10.50 × 28.06 ÷ 1.532 = 192.3.\r\n\r\nThis latter number represents the saponification value of the sample.\r\n\r\n=346. Saponification Equivalent.=—Allen defines the saponification\r\nequivalent as the number of grams of fat saponified by one equivalent,\r\n_viz._, 56.1 grams of potassium hydroxid.[311] The saponification\r\nequivalent is readily calculated from the saponification value using\r\nit as a divisor and 56100 as a dividend. Conversely the saponification\r\nvalue may be obtained by dividing 56100 by the saponification\r\nequivalent. No advantage is gained by the introduction of a new term so\r\nnearly related to saponification value.\r\n\r\n=347. Saponification Value of Pure Glycerids.=—The theoretical\r\nsaponification values of pure glycerids are given in the following\r\ntable.[312]\r\n\r\n                                Molecular   Saponification\r\n     Name.

Acetyl Value.=—Hydroxy acids and alcohols, when heated with\r\nglacial acetic acid, undergo a change which consists in substituting\r\nthe radicle of acetic acid for the hydrogen atom of the alcoholic\r\nhydroxyl group. This change is illustrated by the equations below:[313]\r\n\r\n_For a Fat Acid_:\r\n\r\n    Ricinoleic acid.

The contents of the flask are transferred to a larger vessel\r\nof about one liter capacity, mixed with half a liter of water and\r\nboiled for half an hour. To prevent bumping, some bubbles of carbon\r\ndioxid are drawn through the liquid by means of a tube drawn out to\r\na fine point and extending nearly to the bottom of the flask. The\r\nliquids are allowed to separate into two layers and the water is\r\nremoved with a syphon. The oily matters are treated several times with\r\nboiling water until the acetic acid is all washed out. The acetylated\r\nfat acids are filtered through a dry hot jacket filter and an aliquot\r\npart, from three to five grams, is dissolved in absolute alcohol.\r\nAfter the addition of phenolphthalien the mixture is titrated as in\r\nthe determination of the saponification value. The acid value thus\r\nobtained is designated as the acetyl acid value. A measured quantity\r\nof alcoholic potash, standardized by seminormal hydrochloric acid,\r\nis added, the mixture boiled and the excess of alkali determined by\r\ntitration. The quantity of alkali consumed in this process measures the\r\nacetyl value. The sum of the acetyl acid and the acetyl values is the\r\nacetyl saponification value. The acetyl value is therefore equal to\r\nthe difference of the saponification and acid values of the acetylated\r\nfat acids. In other words, the acetyl value indicates the number of\r\nmilligrams of potassium hydroxid required to neutralize the acetic acid\r\nobtained by the saponification of one gram of the acetylated fat acids.\r\n\r\n_Example._—A portion of the fat acids acetylated as described, weighing\r\n3.379 grams, is exactly neutralized by 17.2 cubic centimeters of\r\nseminormal potassium hydroxid solution, corresponding to 17.2 × 0.02805\r\n= 0.4825 gram of the hydroxid, hence 0.4825 × 1000 ÷ 3.379 = 142.8, the\r\nacetyl acid value of the sample.\r\n\r\nAfter the addition of 32.8 cubic centimeters more of the seminormal\r\npotash solution, the mixture is boiled to saponify the acetylated\r\nfat acids. The residual potash requires 14.2 cubic centimeters of\r\nseminormal hydrochloric acid. The quantity of potash required for the\r\nacetic acid is therefore 32.8 - 14.3 = 18.5 cubic centimeters or 18.5 ×\r\n0.02805 = 0.5189 gram of potassium hydroxid. Then 0.5189 × 1000 ÷ 3.379\r\n= 153.6 = acetyl value of sample. The sum of these two values, _viz._,\r\n142.8 and 153.6 is 296.4, which is the acetyl saponification value of\r\nthe sample. As with the iodin numbers, however, it is also found that\r\nacids of the oleic series give an acetyl value when treated as above,\r\nand it has been proposed by Lewkowitsch to determine, in lieu of the\r\ndata obtained, the actual quantity of acetic acid absorbed by fats.[315]\r\nThis is accomplished by saponifying the acetylated product with\r\nalcoholic potash and determining the free acetic acid by distillation,\r\nin a manner entirely analogous to that used for estimating volatile fat\r\nacids described further on.\r\n\r\nThe rôle which the acetyl value plays in analytical determinations is\r\ninteresting, but the data it gives are not to be valued too highly.\r\n\r\n=349. Determination of Volatile Fat Acids.=—The fat acids which are\r\nvolatile at the temperature of boiling water, consist chiefly of\r\nbutyric and its associated acids occurring in the secretions of the\r\nmammary glands. Among vegetable glycerids cocoanut oil is the only\r\ncommon one which has any notable content of volatile acids. The boiling\r\npoints of the above acids, in a pure state, are much higher than the\r\ntemperature of boiling water; for instance, butyric acid boils at about\r\n162°. By the expression volatile acids, in analytical practice, is\r\nmeant those which are carried over at 100°, or a little above, with\r\nthe water vapor, whatever be their boiling point. The great difficulty\r\nof removing the volatile from the non-volatile fat acids has prevented\r\nthe formulation of any method whereby a sharp and complete separation\r\ncan be accomplished. The analyst, at the present time, must be content\r\nwith some approximate process which, under like conditions, will give\r\ncomparable results. Instead, therefore, of attempting a definite\r\ndetermination, he confines his work to securing a partial separation\r\nand in expressing the degree of volatile acidity in terms of a standard\r\nalkali. To this end, a definite weight of the fat is saponified, the\r\nresulting soap decomposed with an excess of fixed acid, and a definite\r\nvolume of distillate collected and its acidity determined by titration\r\nwith decinormal alkali. The weight of fat operated on is either two and\r\na half[316] or five grams.[317]\r\n\r\nNumerous minor variations have been proposed in the process, the most\r\nimportant of which is in the use of phosphoric instead of sulfuric\r\nacid in the distillation. An extended experience with both acids has\r\nshown that no danger is to be apprehended in the use of sulfuric acid\r\nand that on the whole it is to be preferred to phosphoric.[318]\r\n\r\nThe process as used in this laboratory and as adopted by the official\r\nagricultural chemists is conducted as follows:[319]\r\n\r\n=350. Removal of the Alcohol.=—The saponification is accomplished in\r\nthe manner already described, (=341-344=) and when alcoholic potash is\r\nused proceed as follows:\r\n\r\nThe stopper having been laid loosely in the mouth of the flask, the\r\nalcohol is removed by dipping the flask into a steam-bath. The steam\r\nshould cover the whole of the flask except the neck. After the alcohol\r\nis nearly removed, frothing may be noticed in the soap, and to avoid\r\nany loss from this cause or any creeping of the soap up the sides of\r\nthe flask, it should be removed from the bath and shaken to and fro\r\nuntil the frothing disappears. The last traces of alcohol vapor may be\r\nremoved from the flask by waving it briskly, mouth down, to and fro.\r\n\r\n_Dissolving the Soap._—After the removal of the alcohol the soap\r\nshould be dissolved by adding 100 cubic centimeters of recently\r\nboiled distilled water, or eighty cubic centimeters when aqueous\r\npotassium hydroxid has been used for saponification, and warming on the\r\nsteam-bath, with occasional shaking, until the solution of the soap is\r\ncomplete.\r\n\r\n_Setting free the Fat Acids._—When the soap solution has cooled to\r\nabout 60° or 70°, the fat acids are separated by adding forty cubic\r\ncentimeters of dilute sulfuric acid solution containing twenty-five\r\ngrams of acid in one liter, or sixty cubic centimeters when aqueous\r\npotassium hydroxid has been used for saponification.\r\n\r\n_Melting the Fat Acid Emulsion._—The flask is restoppered as in the\r\nfirst instance and the fat acid emulsion melted by replacing the flask\r\non the steam-bath. According to the nature of the fat examined, the\r\ntime required for the fusion of the fatty acid emulsions may vary from\r\na few minutes to several hours.\r\n\r\n_The Distillation._—After the fat acids are completely melted, which\r\ncan be determined by their forming a transparent, oily layer on the\r\nsurface of the water, the flask is cooled to room temperature, and\r\na few pieces of pumice stone added. The pumice stone is prepared by\r\nthrowing it, at a white heat, into distilled water, and keeping it\r\nunder water until used. The flask is connected with a glass condenser,\r\nFig. 102, slowly heated with a naked flame until ebullition begins, and\r\nthen the distillation continued by regulating the flame in such a way\r\nas to collect 110 cubic centimeters of the distillate in, as nearly as\r\npossible, thirty minutes. The distillate should be received in a flask\r\naccurately marked at 110 cubic centimeters.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 102.—APPARATUS FOR THE DISTILLATION OF VOLATILE\r\nACIDS.]\r\n\r\n_Titration of the Volatile Acids._—The 110 cubic centimeters of\r\ndistillate, after thorough mixing, are filtered through perfectly\r\ndry filter paper, 100 cubic centimeters of the filtered distillate\r\npoured into a beaker holding about a quarter of a liter, half a cubic\r\ncentimeter of phenolphthalien solution added and decinormal barium\r\nhydroxid solution run in until a red color is produced. The contents\r\nof the beaker are then returned to the measuring flask to remove any\r\nacid remaining therein, poured again into the beaker, and the titration\r\ncontinued until the red color produced remains apparently unchanged for\r\ntwo or three minutes, The number of cubic centimeters of decinormal\r\nbarium hydroxid solution required should be increased by one-tenth to\r\nrepresent the entire distillate.\r\n\r\nThe number thus obtained expresses, in cubic centimeters of decinormal\r\nalkali solution, the volatile acidity of the sample. In each case\r\nblank distillations of the reagents used should be conducted under\r\nidentical conditions, especially when alcoholic alkali is used for\r\nsaponification. It is difficult to secure alcohol which will not yield\r\na trace of volatile acid in the conditions named. The quantity of\r\ndecinormal alkali required to neutralize the blank distillate is to be\r\ndeducted from that obtained with the sample of fat.\r\n\r\n=351. Determination of Soluble and Insoluble Fat Acids.=—The volatile\r\nfat acids are more or less soluble in water, while those which are\r\nnot distillable in a current of steam are quite insoluble. It is\r\nadvisable, therefore, to separate these two classes of fat acids, and\r\nthe results thus obtained are perhaps more decidedly quantitive than\r\nare given by the distillation process just described. The methods used\r\nfor determining the percentage of insoluble acids are essentially those\r\nof Hehner.[320] Many variations of the process have been proposed,\r\nespecially in respect of the soluble acids.[321]\r\n\r\nThe process, as conducted in this laboratory and approved by the\r\nAssociation of Official Agricultural Chemists, is as follows:\r\n\r\n_Preparation of Reagents.—Sodium Hydroxid Solution._—A decinormal\r\nsolution of sodium hydroxid is used. Each cubic centimeter contains\r\n0.0040 gram of sodium hydroxid and neutralizes 0.0088 gram of butyric\r\nacid (C₄H₈O₂).\r\n\r\n_Alcoholic Potash Solution._—Dissolve forty grams of good caustic\r\npotash in one liter of ninety-five per cent alcohol redistilled over\r\ncaustic potash or soda. The solution must be clear and the potassium\r\nhydroxid free from carbonates.\r\n\r\n_Standard Acid Solution._—Prepare accurately a half normal solution of\r\nhydrochloric acid.\r\n\r\n_Indicator._—Dissolve one gram of phenolphthalien in 100 cubic\r\ncentimeters of ninety-five per cent alcohol.\r\n\r\n_Determination.—Soluble Acids._—About five grams of the sample are\r\nplaced in the saponification flask already described, fifty cubic\r\ncentimeters of the alcoholic potash solution added, the flask stoppered\r\nand placed in the steam-bath until the fat is entirely saponified. The\r\noperation may be facilitated by occasional agitation. The alcoholic\r\npotash is always measured with the same pipette and uniformity further\r\nsecured by allowing it to drain the same length of time (thirty\r\nseconds). Two or three blank experiments are conducted at the same time.\r\n\r\nIn from five to thirty minutes, according to the nature of the fat, the\r\nliquid will appear perfectly homogeneous and, when this is the case,\r\nthe saponification is complete and the flask is removed and cooled.\r\nWhen sufficiently cool, the stopper is removed and the contents of\r\nthe flask rinsed with a little ninety-five per cent alcohol into an\r\nerlenmeyer, of about 200 cubic centimeters capacity, which is placed on\r\nthe steam-bath together with the blanks until the alcohol is evaporated.\r\n\r\nThe blanks are titrated with half normal hydrochloric acid, using\r\nphenolphthalien as indicator, and one cubic centimeter more of the half\r\nnormal hydrochloric acid than is required to neutralize the potash in\r\nthe blanks is run into each of the flasks containing the fat acids. The\r\nflask is connected with a reflux condenser and placed on the steam-bath\r\nuntil the separated fat acids form a clear stratum on the upper surface\r\nof the liquid. The flask and contents are cooled in ice-water.\r\n\r\nThe fat acids having quite solidified, the liquid contents of the\r\nflask are poured through a dry filter into a liter flask, taking care\r\nnot to break the cake. Between 200 and 300 cubic centimeters of water\r\nare brought into the flask, the cork with the condenser reinserted\r\nand the flask placed on the steam-bath until the cake of acid is\r\nthoroughly melted. During the melting of the cake of fat acids, the\r\nflask should occasionally be agitated with a rotary motion in such a\r\nway that its contents are not made to touch the cork. When the fat\r\nacids have again separated into an oily layer, the flask and its\r\ncontents are cooled in ice-water and the liquid filtered through the\r\nsame filter into the same liter flask as before. This treatment with\r\nhot water, followed by cooling and filtration of the wash water, is\r\nrepeated three times, the washings being added to the first filtrate.\r\nThe mixed washings and filtrate are made up to one liter, and 100\r\ncubic centimeters thereof in duplicate are titrated with decinormal\r\nsodium hydroxid. The number of cubic centimeters of sodium hydroxid\r\nrequired for each 100 cubic centimeters of the filtrate is multiplied\r\nby ten. The number so obtained represents the volume of decinormal\r\nsodium hydroxid neutralized by the soluble fat acids of the fat, plus\r\nthat corresponding to the excess of the standard acid used, _viz._, one\r\ncubic centimeter. The number is therefore to be diminished by five,\r\ncorresponding to the excess of one cubic centimeter of half normal\r\nacid. This corrected volume multiplied by 0.0088 gives the weight of\r\nsoluble acids as butyric acid in the amount of fat saponified.\r\n\r\n_Insoluble Acids._—The flask containing the cake of insoluble fat acids\r\nfrom the above determination and the paper through which the soluble\r\nfat acids have been filtered are allowed to drain and dry for twelve\r\nhours, when the cake, together with as much of the fat acids as can be\r\nremoved from the filter paper, is transferred to a weighed evaporating\r\ndish. The funnel, with the filter, is then placed in an erlenmeyer and\r\nthe paper thoroughly washed with absolute alcohol. The flask is rinsed\r\nwith the washings from the filter paper, then with pure alcohol, and\r\nthe rinsings transferred to the evaporating dish. The dish is placed\r\non the steam-bath until the alcohol is evaporated, dried for two hours\r\nat 100°, cooled in a desiccator and weighed. It is again placed in the\r\nair-bath for two hours, cooled as before and weighed. If there be any\r\nconsiderable decrease in weight, reheat two hours and weigh again. The\r\nfinal weighing gives the weight of insoluble fat acids in the sample,\r\nfrom which the percentage is easily calculated.\r\n\r\nThe quantity of non-volatile and insoluble acids in common glycerids\r\nis from ninety-five to ninety-seven parts in 100. The glycerids yield\r\nalmost the same proportion of fat acids and glycerol when the acids are\r\ninsoluble and have high molecular weights. When the acids are soluble\r\nand the molecular weight low the proportion of acids decreases and that\r\nof glycerol increases.\r\n\r\nIn the following table will be found the data secured by quantitive\r\nsaponification and separation of soluble and insoluble acids found in\r\nthe more common glycerids:[322]\r\n\r\n                                                 Yield per 100 parts\r\n                           Molecular weight of       of glycerid.\r\n    Glycerid.

It is evident from this that the yield of more than 100 parts\r\nof fat acids and glycerol given by glycerids is due to the absorption\r\nof water during the reaction.\r\n\r\n=352. Formulas for General Calculations.=—For calculating the\r\ntheoretical yields of fat acids and glycerol, the following general\r\nformulas may be used:\r\n\r\n    Let _M_ = the molecular weight of the fat acid:\r\n        _K_ = saponification value:\r\n        _F_ = the quantity of free fat acids in the glycerid:\r\n        _N_ = the quantity of neutral fat in the glycerid:\r\n        _A_ = the number of milligrams of potassium hydroxid required\r\n              to saturate the free acid in one gram of the\r\n              sample.\r\n\r\nThe free acid is determined by the method given below.\r\n\r\n_M_ grams of a fat acid require 56100 milligrams of potassium hydroxid\r\nfor complete neutralization while _F_ grams corresponding to 100 grams\r\nof fat are saturated by 100 × _A_ milligrams of the alkali.\r\n\r\n    Then _M_ : 56100 = _F_ : 100_A_.\r\n\r\n                  _AM_\r\n    Whence _F_ = ------                 (1).\r\n                   561\r\n\r\nLikewise since _M_ grams of fat acid require the quantity of potassium\r\nhydroxid mentioned above we have:\r\n\r\n    1 : _K_ = _M_ : 56100,\r\n\r\n                 56100\r\n    Whence _M_ = ------                 (2).\r\n                  _K_\r\n\r\n    Substituting this value of _M_ in (1) we have\r\n\r\n          _A_ × 56100    100_A_\r\n    _F_ = ------------ = -------        (3).\r\n            561 × _K_      _K_\r\n\r\nIt is evident that it is not necessary to calculate the acid value\r\n(_A_) of the sample and the saponification value (_K_) of the free fat\r\nacids, the ratio _A_/_K_ alone being required. It will be sufficient\r\ntherefore to substitute for _A_ and _K_ the number of cubic centimeters\r\nof alkali solutions required for one gram of the fat and one gram of\r\nthe fat acids, respectively. If _a_ and _b_ represent these numbers the\r\nformula may be written\r\n\r\n          100_a_\r\n    _F_ = -------                       (4);\r\n           _b_\r\n\r\n                                100_a_\r\n    and _N_ = 100 - _F_ = 100 - ------  (5).\r\n                                  _b_\r\n\r\nTo simplify the determinations, it may be assumed that the free fat\r\nacids have the same molecular weight as those still in combination with\r\nthe glycerol in any given sample. On this assumption, the process may\r\nbe carried on by determining the acid value _A_ and the saponification\r\nvalue _K_ for the total fat acids. The mean molecular weight _M_, the\r\npercentage of free fat acids _F_, and the proportion of neutral fat\r\n_N_, may then be calculated from the formulas (2), (3), (4), and (5).\r\n\r\nFurther, let _G_ = the quantity of glycerol and _L_ that of fat acids\r\nobtainable from one gram of neutral fat, that is, ¹/₁₀₀ of _H_ the\r\npercentage of total fat acids.\r\n\r\nThe molecular weight of the neutral fat in each case is 3_M_ + 38.\r\nTherefore, 3_M_ + 38 parts of neutral fat yield 3_M_ parts of fat acids\r\nand ninety-two parts of glycerol (C₃H₈O₃ = 92).\r\n\r\n                _H_        3_M_\r\n    Then _L_ = ----- = ----------       (6);\r\n                100     3_M_ + 38\r\n\r\n                 92\r\n    and _G_ = ---------                 (7).\r\n              3_M_ + 38\r\n\r\n_N_ per cent of neutral fat yields, therefore, on saponification, the\r\nfollowing theoretical quantities of fat acids _F_, and glycerol _G_\r\nexpressed as parts per hundred.\r\n\r\n                      3_M_\r\n        _F_ = _N_ × --------            (8);\r\n                    3_M_ + 38\r\n\r\n                       92\r\n    and _G_ = _N_ × ---------           (9).\r\n                    3_M_ + 38\r\n\r\nFormula (9) expresses also the total yield of glycerol from any given\r\nsample. For a further discussion of this part of the subject a work of\r\na more technical character may be consulted.[323]\r\n\r\n=353. Determination of a Free Fat Acid in a Fat.=—The principle of\r\nthe method rests upon the comparative accuracy with which a free fat\r\nacid can be titrated with a set alkali solution when phenolphthalien\r\nis used as an indicator. Among the many methods of manipulation which\r\nthe analyst has at his command there is probably none more simple and\r\naccurate than that depending on the solution of the sample in alcohol,\r\nether, chloroform, or carbon tetrachlorid. Any acidity of the solvent\r\nis determined by separate titration and the proper correction made.\r\nEither an aqueous or alcoholic solution of the alkali may be used,\r\npreferably the latter. The alkaline solution may be approximately or\r\nexactly decinormal, but it is easier to make it approximately so and\r\nto determine its real value before each operation by titration against\r\na standard decinormal solution of acid. About ten grams of the sample\r\nand fifty cubic centimeters of the solvent will be found convenient\r\nquantities.\r\n\r\n_Example._—Ten grams of rancid olive oil dissolved in alcohol ether\r\nrequire three and eight-tenths cubic centimeters of a solution of\r\nalcoholic potash to saturate the free acid present. When titrated with\r\ndecinormal acid the potash solution is found to contain 25.7 milligrams\r\nof potassium hydroxid in each cubic centimeter. The specific gravity\r\nof the oil is 0.917 and the weight used therefore 9.17 grams. Then the\r\ntotal quantity of potassium hydroxid required for the neutralization of\r\nthe acid is 25.7 × 3.8 = 97.7 milligrams.\r\n\r\nThe acid value _A_ is therefore:\r\n\r\n          3.8 × 25.7\r\n    _A_ = ----------- = 10.6\r\n             9.17\r\n\r\nIt is customary to regard free acid as oleic, molecular weight 282. On\r\nthis assumption the percentage of free acids in the above case is found\r\nby the formula\r\n\r\n                     3.8 × 25.7 × 282\r\n    _A_ (per cent) = ----------------- = 5.35\r\n                        561 × 9.17\r\n\r\n=354. Identification of Oils and Fats.=—Properly, the methods of\r\nidentifying and isolating the different oils and fats should be\r\nlooked for in works on food adulteration. There are, however, many\r\ncharacteristics of these glycerids which can be advantageously\r\ndiscussed in a work of this kind. Many cases arise in which the analyst\r\nis called upon to determine the nature of a fat and discover whether\r\nit be admixed with other glycerids. It is important often to know in\r\na given case whether an oil be of animal or vegetable origin. Many of\r\nthe methods of analysis already described are found useful in such\r\ndiscriminations. For instance, a large amount of soluble or volatile\r\nacids in the sample under examination, would indicate the presence\r\nof a fat derived from milk while the form of the crystals in a solid\r\nfat would give a clue to whether it were the product of the ox or the\r\nswine. In the succeeding paragraphs will be briefly outlined some of\r\nthe more important additional methods of determining the nature and\r\norigin of fats and oils of which the history is unknown.\r\n\r\nThe data obtained by means of the methods which have been described,\r\nboth physical and chemical, are all useful in judging the character and\r\nnature of a glycerid of unknown origin. The colorations produced by\r\noxidizing agents, in the manner already set forth will be found useful,\r\nespecially when joined to those obtained with cottonseed and sesame\r\noils yet to be described. For instance, the red coloration produced by\r\nnitric acid of 1.37 specific gravity is regarded by some authorities\r\nas characteristic of cottonseed oil as well as the reduction by it of\r\nsilver nitrate. The coloration tests with silver nitrate (paragraph\r\n=320=) and with phosphomolydic acid (paragraph =318=) are also helpful\r\nin classifying oils in respect of their animal or vegetable origin.\r\nThe careful consideration of these tests, together with a study of the\r\nnumbers obtained by treating the samples with iodin, and the heat of\r\nbromination and sulfuric saponification, is commended to all who are\r\ninterested in classifying oils. In addition to these reactions a few\r\nspecific tests are added for more detailed work.\r\n\r\n=355. Consistence.=—It has already been said that oils are mostly of\r\nvegetable origin and the solid fats of animal derivation. In the animal\r\neconomy it would be a source of disturbance to have in the tissues a\r\nlarge body of fat which would remain in a liquid state at the normal\r\ntemperature of the body. Nearly all the animal fats are found to have\r\na higher melting point than the body containing them. An exception is\r\nfound in the case of butter fat, but it should be remembered that this\r\nfat is an excretion and not intended for tissue building until it has\r\nundergone subsequent digestion. Fish oils are another notable exception\r\nto the rule, but in this case these oils can hardly be regarded as true\r\nglycerids in the ordinary sense of that term.\r\n\r\nIn general, it may be said that a sample of a glycerid, which in its\r\nnatural state remains liquid at usual room temperatures, is probably\r\nan oil of vegetable origin. Fish oils have also an odor and taste\r\nwhich prevent them from being confounded with vegetable oils. In oils\r\nwhich are manufactured from animal glycerids such as lard oil, the\r\ndiscrimination is more difficult but peculiarities of taste and color\r\nare generally perceptible.\r\n\r\n=356. Nature of the Fat Acid.=—When it is not possible to discriminate\r\nbetween samples by the sensible physical properties just described,\r\nmuch light can be thrown on their origin by the determination of their\r\nother physical properties, such as specific gravity, refractive index,\r\nmelting point, etc., in the manner already fully described. Further\r\nlight may be furnished by saponification and separation of the fat\r\nacids. The relative quantities of oleic, stearic, palmitic, and other\r\nacids will help to a correct judgment in respect of the nature of the\r\nsample. The vegetable oils and lard oils, for instance, consist chiefly\r\nof olein; lard and tallow contain a large proportion of stearin; palm\r\noil and butter fat contain considerable portions of palmitin, and\r\nthe latter is distinguished moreover by the presence of soluble and\r\nvolatile acids combined as butyrin and its associated glycerids.\r\n\r\nOleic acid can be rather readily separated from stearic and palmitic\r\nby reason of the solubility of its lead salts in ether. One method of\r\naccomplishing this separation has already been described (paragraph\r\n=339=).\r\n\r\n=357. Separation with Lime.=—A quicker, though perhaps not as accurate\r\na separation of the oleic from the palmitic and stearic acids, is\r\naccomplished by means of lime according to the method developed by\r\nBondzyuski and Rufi.[324] This process is used chiefly, however, to\r\nseparate the free fat acids (palmitic, stearic) from the neutral fat\r\nand the free oleic acid. It probably has no point of superiority over\r\nthe lead process.\r\n\r\n=358. Separation of the Glycerids.=—The fact that olein is liquid at\r\ntemperatures allowing palmitin and stearin to remain solid, permits of\r\na rough separation of these two classes of bodies by mechanical means.\r\nThe mixed fats are first melted and allowed to cool very slowly. In\r\nthese conditions the stearin and palmitin separate from the olein in\r\na crystalline form and the olein is removed by pressure through bags.\r\nIn this way lard is separated into lard oil, consisting chiefly of\r\nolein, and lard stearin, consisting largely of stearin. Beef (caul) fat\r\nis in a similar manner separated into a liquid (oleo-oil) and a solid\r\n(oleo-stearin) portion. It is evident that these separations are only\r\napproximate, but by repeated fractionations a moderately pure olein or\r\nstearin may be obtained.\r\n\r\n=359. Separation as Lead Salts.=—Muter’s process, with a special\r\npiece of apparatus, has already been described (=339=). For general\r\nanalytical work the special tube may be omitted. In a mixture of\r\ninsoluble free fat acids all are precipitated by lead acetate, and the\r\nresulting soap may be extracted with ether, either with successive\r\nshakings or in a continuous extraction apparatus. In this latter case\r\na little of the lead stearate or palmitate may pass into solution in\r\nthe hot ether and afterwards separate on cooling. When the operation\r\nis conducted on from two to three grams of the dry mixed acids, the\r\npercentage proportions of the soluble and insoluble acids (in ether)\r\ncan be determined. The lead salt which passes into solution can be\r\ndecomposed and the oleic acid removed, dried and weighed. Dilute\r\nhydrochloric acid is a suitable reagent for decomposing the lead soap.\r\nThe difference between the weight of the oleic acid and that of the\r\nmixed acids before conversion into lead soap furnishes the basis for\r\nthe calculation. For further details in respect of the fat acids the\r\nreader may consult special analytical works.[325]\r\n\r\n=360. Separation of Arachidic Acid.=—Peanut oil is easily distinguished\r\nfrom other vegetable glycerids by the presence of arachidic acid.\r\n\r\nThe method used in this laboratory for separating arachidic acid is\r\na modification of the usual methods based on the process as carried\r\nout by Milliau.[326] About twenty grams of the oil are saponified with\r\nalcoholic soda, using twenty cubic centimeters of 36° baumé soda\r\nsolution diluted with 100 cubic centimeters of ninety per cent alcohol.\r\nWhen the saponification is complete, the soda is converted into the\r\nlead soap by treatment with a slight excess of a saturated alcoholic\r\nsolution of lead acetate. Good results are also obtained by using\r\ndilute alcohol, _viz._, fifty per cent, instead of ninety per cent, in\r\npreparing the lead acetate solution.\r\n\r\nWhile still warm the supernatant liquid is decanted, the precipitate\r\nwashed by decantation with warm ninety per cent alcohol and triturated\r\nwith ether in a mortar four times, decanting the ethereal solution in\r\neach instance. By this treatment all of the lead oleate and hypogaeate\r\nare removed and are found in the ethereal solution, from which they can\r\nbe recovered and the acids set free by hydrochloric acid and determined\r\nin the usual way.\r\n\r\nThe residue is transferred to a large dish containing two or three\r\nliters of pure water and decomposed by the addition of about fifty\r\ncubic centimeters of strong hydrochloric acid. The lead chlorid formed\r\nis soluble in the large quantity of water present, which should be\r\nwarm enough to keep the free acids in a liquid state in which form\r\nthey float as a clear oily liquid on the surface. The free acids are\r\ndecanted and washed with warm water to remove the last traces of lead\r\nchlorid and hydrochloric acid. The last traces of water are removed\r\nby drying in a thin layer in vacuo. Practically all of the acids,\r\noriginally present in the sample except oleic and hypogaeic, are thus\r\nobtained in a free state and their weight is determined.\r\n\r\nThe arachidic acid may be separated almost quantitively by dissolving\r\nthe mixed acids in forty cubic centimeters of ninety per cent alcohol,\r\nadding a drop of hydrochloric acid, cooling to 16° and allowing to\r\nstand until the arachidic acid has crystallized. The crystals are\r\npurified by washing twice with twenty cubic centimeters of ninety\r\nper cent and three times with the same quantity of seventy per cent\r\nalcohol. The residual impure arachidic acid is dissolved in boiling\r\nabsolute alcohol, poured through a filter and washed with pure hot\r\nalcohol. The filtrate is evaporated to dryness and heated to 100° until\r\na constant weight is obtained. From the above data, the percentages of\r\noleic, hypogaeic, arachidic and other acids in the sample examined are\r\ncalculated.\r\n\r\nIn the above process, owing to the pasty state of the lead soaps, the\r\ntrituration in a mortar with ether is found troublesome. The extraction\r\nof the lead oleate and hypogaeate is facilitated by throwing the pasty\r\nethereal mass on a filter and washing it thoroughly with successive\r\nportions of about fifty cubic centimeters of ether. By this variation,\r\nit was found by Krug in this laboratory, that less ether was required\r\nand a more complete removal of the lead oleate effected. The solution\r\nof the lead oleate is completed by about half a dozen washings with\r\nether as above described. The extraction may also be secured by placing\r\nthe lead soaps in a large extracting apparatus and proceeding as\r\ndirected in paragraph =40=. The residue is washed from the filter paper\r\ninto a large porcelain dish and decomposed as already described with\r\nhydrochloric acid. After the separation is complete, the mixture is\r\ncooled until the acids are solid. The solid acids are then transferred\r\nto a smaller dish, freed of water and dissolved in ether. The ethereal\r\nsolution is washed with water to remove any traces of lead salt or of\r\nhydrochloric acid. After the removal of the ether, the arachidic acid\r\nis separated as has already been described.\r\n\r\nThe melting point of pure arachidic acid varies from 73° to 75°.\r\n\r\n=361. Detection of Arachis= (=Peanut=) =Oil.=—Kreis has modified\r\nthe usual process of Renard for the detection of arachis oil, by\r\nprecipitating the solution of the fat acid with an alcoholic instead\r\nof an aqueous solution of lead acetate, in a manner quite similar to\r\nthat described above.[327] The fat acids are obtained in the usual\r\nmanner, washed with hot water and the acids from twenty grams of the\r\noil dissolved in 100 cubic centimeters of ninety per cent alcohol.\r\nThe solution is cooled in ice-water and the fat acids precipitated by\r\nthe addition of fifteen grams of lead acetate dissolved in 150 cubic\r\ncentimeters of ninety per cent alcohol. The precipitate, after standing\r\nfor two hours, is separated by filtration through cotton wool and is\r\nextracted for six hours with ether. The residue is boiled with 250\r\ncubic centimeters of five per cent hydrochloric acid until the fat\r\nacids appear as a clear oily layer upon the surface. The acids thus\r\nobtained are washed with hot water to remove lead chlorid, dried by\r\npressing between blotting paper, dissolved in 100 cubic centimeters of\r\nninety per cent alcohol, cooled to 15° and allowed to stand for several\r\nhours, after which time any arachidic acid present is separated by\r\ncrystallization and identified in the usual manner.\r\n\r\nWhen it is not important to obtain all of the acid present, the process\r\nmay be simplified in the following manner:\r\n\r\nThe fat acids obtained from twenty grams of oil are dissolved in 300\r\ncubic centimeters of ether and treated at the temperature of ice-water\r\nwith a quantity of the alcoholic lead acetate solution mentioned above.\r\nLead oleate remains in solution and the precipitate which forms after\r\na few hours consists almost wholly of the lead salts of the solid fat\r\nacids. The precipitate is collected, washed with ether and identified\r\nin the usual manner.\r\n\r\n=362. Cottonseed Oil, Bechi’s Test.=—Crude, fresh cottonseed oil, when\r\nnot too highly colored, and generally the refined article, may be\r\ndistinguished from other oils by the property of reducing silver salts\r\nin certain conditions. The reaction was first noticed by Bechi and has\r\nbeen the subject of extensive discussions.[328]\r\n\r\nThe process as proposed by Bechi has been modified in many ways but\r\napparently without improving it. It is conducted as follows: One gram\r\nof silver nitrate is dissolved in 200 cubic centimeters of ninety-eight\r\nper cent alcohol and forty cubic centimeters of ether and one drop of\r\nnitric acid added to the mixture. Ten cubic centimeters of the oil\r\nare shaken in a test tube with one cubic centimeter of this reagent,\r\nand then with ten cubic centimeters of a mixture containing 100\r\ncubic centimeters of amyl alcohol and ten of colza oil. The mixture\r\nis divided into two portions, one of which is put aside for future\r\ncomparison and the other plunged into boiling water for fifteen\r\nminutes. A deep brown or black color, due to the reduction of silver,\r\nreveals the presence of cottonseed oil.\r\n\r\nIn this laboratory the heating is accomplished in a small porcelain\r\ndish on which is often deposited a brilliant mirror of metallic silver.\r\nThe white color of the porcelain also serves as a background for the\r\nobservation of the coloration produced. In most instances a green color\r\nhas been noticed after the reduction of the silver is practically\r\ncomplete. Unless cottonseed oil has been boiled or refined in some\r\nunusual way, the test, as applied above, is rarely negative. The\r\nreduction of the silver is doubtless due to some aldehydic principle,\r\npresent in extremely minute quantities, and which may be removed by\r\nsome methods of technical treatment. The silver nitrate test therefore\r\nis reliable when the reduction takes place, but the absence of a\r\ndistinct reaction may not in all cases prove the absence of cottonseed\r\noil.\r\n\r\n=363. Milliau’s Process.=—Milliau has proposed the application of\r\nthe silver salt directly to the free fat acids of the oil instead of\r\nto the oil itself.[329] About fifteen cubic centimeters of the oil\r\nare saponified with alcoholic potash in the usual manner, 150 cubic\r\ncentimeters of water added to the dish and the mixture boiled until\r\nthe alcohol is evaporated. The fat acids are freed by the addition of\r\ndecinormal sulfuric acid and as they rise to the surface in a pasty\r\ncondition are removed with a spoon. The free acids are washed with\r\ndistilled water. The water is drained off and the free acids dissolved\r\nin fifteen cubic centimeters of ninety-two per cent alcohol and two\r\ncubic centimeters of a three per cent solution of silver nitrate.\r\nThe test tube containing the mixture is well shaken and placed in a\r\nwater-bath, out of contact with light, and left until about one-third\r\nof the alcohol is evaporated. Ten cubic centimeters of water are\r\nadded, the heating continued for a few minutes and the color of the\r\nsupernatant fat acids observed. The presence of cottonseed oil is\r\nrevealed by the production of a lustrous precipitate which colors the\r\nfat acids black. In some cases the process of Milliau gives better\r\nresults than the original method of Bechi, but this is not always the\r\ncase. It does away with the use of amyl alcohol and colza oil, but\r\nits manipulation is more difficult. In all doubtful cases the analyst\r\nshould apply both methods.\r\n\r\n=364. Detection of Sesame Oil.=—Milliau has pointed out a\r\ncharacteristic reaction of this oil which may be used with advantage\r\nin cases of doubtful identity.[330] The identification is based on the\r\nfact that the free acids of sesame oil, or some concomitant thereof,\r\ngive a rose-red color when brought in contact with a solution of sugar\r\nin hydrochloric acid.\r\n\r\nThe analytical process is conducted as follows: About fifteen grams\r\nof the oil are saponified with alcoholic soda and when the reaction\r\nis complete treated with 200 cubic centimeters of hot water and\r\nboiled until the alcohol is removed. The fat acids are set free with\r\ndecinormal sulfuric acid and removed with a spoon as they rise to the\r\nsurface in a pasty state, in which condition they are washed by shaking\r\nwith water in a large test tube. When washed, the acids are placed in\r\nan oven at 105° until the greater part of the water is evaporated and\r\nthe acids begin to become fluid. At this point they are treated with\r\nhalf their volume of hydrochloric acid saturated with finely ground\r\nsugar. On shaking the mixture, a rose color is developed which is\r\ncharacteristic of the sesame oil. Other oils give either no coloration\r\nor at most a yellow tint.\r\n\r\n=365. The Sulfur Chlorid Reaction.=—Some vegetable oils, when treated\r\nwith sulfur chlorid, give a hard product similar to elaidin, while lard\r\ndoes not. This reaction is therefore helpful in discriminating between\r\nsome vegetable and animal glycerids. The process which is described by\r\nWarren has been used with some satisfaction in this laboratory.[331]\r\n\r\nFive grams of the oil or fat are placed in a tared porcelain dish and\r\ntreated with two cubic centimeters of carbon bisulfid and the same\r\nquantity of sulfur chlorid. The dish is placed on a steam-bath and its\r\ncontents stirred until the reaction is well under way. The heating is\r\ncontinued until all volatile products are evaporated, the hard mass\r\nbeing well rubbed up to facilitate the escape of imprisoned vapors.\r\nThe powdered or pasty mass is transferred to a filter and washed with\r\ncarbon bisulfid to remove all unaltered oil. The washing with carbon\r\nbisulfid is hastened by pressure and about 200 cubic centimeters of the\r\nsolvent should be used. After drying, the weight of insoluble matter is\r\nobtained and deducted from the total weight of the sample used.\r\n\r\nThe color and tenacity of the hard, insoluble portion are\r\ncharacteristic. The quantitive part of the operation appears to have\r\nbut little value, but applied qualitively in this laboratory it\r\nproduces hard, leathery masses with cotton, olive and peanut oils,\r\nand but little change in lard and beef fats. Qualitively applied,\r\nthe process is conducted as described above but without making the\r\nweighings. In this instance it is as easy of application as the process\r\nof Bechi and is deserving of greater attention than has been given it\r\nby analysts.\r\n\r\nIn the combination which takes place between the sulfur and the fat it\r\nis probable that only addition products are formed, since the quantity\r\nof alkali required for saponification is not diminished by previously\r\ntreating the fat with sulfur chlorid.[332] The reactions which take\r\nplace are probably well represented by the following equations, in\r\nwhich oleic acid is treated with sulfur chlorid:\r\n\r\n    C₁₈H₃₄O₂ + S = C₁₈H₃₄S.O₂.\r\n    C₁₈H₃₄S.O₂ + NaOH = C₁₈H₃₄SO₂Na + H₂O.\r\n\r\n=366. Detection of Cholesterin and Phytosterin in\r\nGlycerids.=—Cholesterin is often found in animal glycerids and a\r\ncorresponding body, phytosterin, is sometimes found in oils of a\r\nvegetable origin.[333] When one of these two bodies is present it may\r\nbe useful in distinguishing between animal and vegetable glycerids.\r\nThey are detected as follows: Fifty grams of the glycerids in each\r\ncase are saponified with alcoholic alkali, preferably potash, in order\r\nto have a soft soap. After saponification is complete, the alcohol is\r\nevaporated and the residual soap dissolved in two liters of water.\r\nThe mixture is shaken with ether and the ethereal solution evaporated\r\nto a small bulk. The residue, which may contain a small quantity of\r\nunsaponified fat, is again treated with alcoholic potash and subjected\r\na second time to the action of ether, as indicated above, with the\r\naddition of a few drops of water and of alcohol if the emulsion\r\nseparate slowly. The ethereal extract finally secured is allowed to\r\nevaporate slowly and the cholesterin (phytosterin) is obtained in a\r\ncrystalline form. The melting point of the cholesterin crystals is 146°\r\nand that of the phytosterin 132°.\r\n\r\nCholesterin crystallizes in thin rhombic tables while phytosterin\r\nseparates in stellar aggregates or in bundles of long needles.\r\n\r\nWhen dissolved in chloroform the two products show different color\r\nreactions with sulfuric acid, cholesterin giving a cherry and\r\nphytosterin a blue-red tint. In a mixture of animal and vegetable\r\nglycerids the two products are obtained together and the melting point\r\nof the mixture may afford some idea of the relative quantities of each\r\npresent. It is evident, however, that no reliable judgment can be\r\nformed from these data of the relative proportions of the two kinds of\r\nglycerids in the original sample.\r\n\r\n=367. Cholesterin and Paraffin in Ether Extracts.=—In ethereal extracts\r\nof some bodies, especially of flowers of the chrysanthemum, paraffin\r\nis found combined with cholesterin. The two bodies may be separated as\r\nfollows:[334]\r\n\r\nThe ether extract is treated with aqueous then with alcoholic potash\r\nseveral times; the residue soluble in ether is a solid body melting at\r\nfrom 70° to 100°.\r\n\r\nIf the ethereal solution be cooled in a mixture of snow and salt, a\r\ncrystalline deposit is formed. This substance, purified by repeated\r\nprecipitations, is obtained colorless in fine crystalline scales\r\nmelting at 64°. It is very soluble in ether, benzene and chloroform,\r\nalmost insoluble in cold alcohol, and somewhat soluble in hot.\r\n\r\nIts percentage composition is:\r\n\r\n              Per cent.\r\n    Carbon     85.00\r\n    Hydrogen   14.95\r\n\r\nIt is therefore a paraffin.\r\n\r\nThe ethereal solution, freed by the above process from paraffin, leaves\r\non evaporation a crystalline mass which is cholesterin, retaining\r\nstill a small quantity of fat matters. In treating the crystals with\r\nalcoholic potash these fat bodies are saponified and the residue is\r\ntaken up with ether. The cholesterin is obtained in fine needles\r\nmelting at from 170° to 176°. It presents all the reactions of\r\ncholesterin, especially the characteristic reaction with chloroform and\r\nsulfuric acid.\r\n\r\n=368. Absorption of Oxygen.=—Among oils a distinction is made between\r\nthose which oxidize readily and those which are of a more stable\r\ncomposition. Linseed oil, for instance, in presence of certain metallic\r\noxids, absorbs oxygen readily and is a type of the drying oils, while\r\nolive oil represents the opposite type.\r\n\r\nThe method of determining the quantity of oxygen absorbed is due to\r\nLivache and is carried out as follows:[335]\r\n\r\nPrecipitated metallic lead (by zinc) is mixed in a flat dish, with\r\nthe oil to be tested, in the proportions of one gram of lead to\r\nthree-quarters of a gram of oil, and exposed to the air and light of\r\nthe workroom. The dish is weighed from time to time until there is no\r\nlonger any increase in weight.\r\n\r\nInstead of lead, finely divided copper has been used by Krug in this\r\nlaboratory, but the percentage of absorption of oxygen is not so\r\nhigh with copper as with lead. Krug found the quantities of oxygen\r\nabsorbed, after nine days, by the samples treated with copper and lead\r\nrespectively to be the following:\r\n\r\n                     Copper, per cent    Lead, per\r\n                     oxygen absorbed.   cent oxygen\r\n                                         absorbed.\r\n\r\n    Olive oil              1.69            2.03\r\n    Cottonseed oil         4.25            5.30\r\n    Peanut oil             2.74            3.87\r\n    Linseed oil            5.55            7.32\r\n\r\nLivache found that linseed oil absorbed about twice as much oxygen as\r\nindicated by the data just given.\r\n\r\n=369. Elaidin Reactions.=—In discriminating between oils and fats\r\nhaving a preponderance of olein and others with a smaller proportion of\r\nthat glycerid, the conversion of the olein into its isomer elaidin is\r\nof diagnostic value. The following will be found a convenient method of\r\napplying this test:[336]\r\n\r\nAbout ten cubic centimeters of the oil are placed in a test tube\r\ntogether with half that quantity of nitric acid and one gram of\r\nmercury. The mixture is shaken until the mercury dissolves when the\r\nmass is allowed to remain at rest for twenty minutes. At the end of\r\nthis time it is again shaken and placed aside. In from one to three\r\nhours the reaction is complete. Olive, peanut and lard oils give\r\nvery hard elaidins. The depth to which a plunger of given weight and\r\ndimensions sinks into an elaidin mixture at a given temperature, has\r\nbeen used as a measure of the percentage of olein contained in the\r\nsample of oil, but it is evident that such a determination is only\r\nroughly approximate. Copper may be used instead of mercury for the\r\ngeneration of the oxids of nitrogen, but it is not so effective. The\r\nvapors of nitric oxids may also be conducted directly into the oil\r\nfrom a convenient generator. The reaction may also be accomplished\r\nby shaking the oil with nitric acid and adding, a drop at a time, a\r\nsolution of potassium nitrite.\r\n\r\n\r\nAUTHORITIES CITED IN PART FOURTH.\r\n\r\n[229] Benedikt and Lewkowitsch; Oils, Fats, Waxes, p. 1.\r\n\r\n[230] Op. cit. supra, p. 46.\r\n\r\n[231] Archiv für Physiologie, 1895, Band 61, S. 341: Chemiker-Zeitung\r\nRepertorium, Band 16, S. 338.\r\n\r\n[232] Vid. op. cit. 1, p. 63.\r\n\r\n[233] Bulletin No. 46, Division of Chemistry, U.

Nature of Nitrogenous Bodies.=—The nitrogenous bodies, valuable\r\nas foods, belong to the general class of proteids and albuminoids. They\r\nare composed chiefly of carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, sulfur and nitrogen.\r\nSome of them, as lecithin and nuclein, contain phosphorus instead of\r\nsulfur, but these resemble the fats rather than the proteids.\r\n\r\nNitrogenous organic bodies of the class mentioned above are designated\r\nby the general name proteids. The term albumin is restricted in a\r\nphysiological sense to a certain class of proteids. The term albuminoid\r\nis often used synonymously, as above, for proteids, but, more strictly\r\nspeaking, it should be reserved for that class of bodies such as\r\ngelatin, mucin, keratin and the like, not really proteids, but,\r\nnevertheless, closely resembling them.[337] In chemical composition the\r\nproteids are characterized by the relative constancy of their nitrogen\r\ncontent, the mean percentage of this element being about sixteen, but\r\nvarying in some instances more than two units from that number.\r\n\r\n=371. Classification of Proteids.=—Many classifications of the\r\nproteids have been given based on physical, chemical and physiological\r\ncharacteristics. In respect of origin, they are divided into two great\r\nclasses, _viz._, vegetable and animal. In respect of their physical and\r\nchemical properties the following classification of the proteids may be\r\nmade.[338]\r\n\r\n_Albumins._—These are proteids soluble in water and not precipitated\r\nfrom their aqueous solutions by sodium chlorid or magnesium sulfate.\r\nThey are easily coagulated by heat and are represented by three great\r\nclasses, _viz._, egg-, serum-, and lactalbumin.\r\n\r\nEgg albumin occurs in the white of egg; serum albumin is found in the\r\nserum of the blood. Vegetable albumins have been prepared from wheat,\r\nrye, potatoes, and papaws. (_Carica Papaya_). These vegetable albumins\r\nare coagulated by heat at about 70° and are not precipitated by the\r\nsalt solutions named above, nor by acetic acid. The myrosin of mustard\r\nseeds also resembles vegetable albumin.\r\n\r\n_Globulins._—These bodies are insoluble in water, soluble in dilute\r\nsolutions of neutral salts, but precipitated therefrom by saturation\r\nwith sodium chlorid or magnesium sulfate. They are coagulated by heat.\r\nAmong others belonging to this group are serum globulin, fibrinogen,\r\nmyosin, crystalin, and globin.\r\n\r\nSerum globulin is found in the serum of blood; cell globulin is found\r\nin lymph cells; fibrinogen occurs in the blood plasma; plasmin, in\r\nblood plasma; myosin, in dead muscles; vitellin, in the yolk of eggs;\r\ncrystalin, in the lens of the eye; haemoglobin, in the red pigment of\r\nthe blood; haemocyanin, in the blood of certain low grade animals.\r\n\r\nVegetable globulins are found in the cereals, leguminous plants,\r\npapaws and other vegetables, and are divided into two groups, myosins\r\nand paraglobulins. The vegetable myosins coagulate at from 55° to\r\n60° and are precipitated from a saline solution by removing the salt\r\nby dialysis. In this form, however, they lose their true nature as\r\nglobulins, becoming insoluble in weak saline solutions.\r\n\r\nThe vegetable paraglobulins are coagulated at from 70° to 75°.\r\nVegetable vitellin, which is not included in this classification, can\r\nbe obtained in a crystalline form and of remarkable purity.[339]\r\n\r\n_Albuminates._—This name is given to the compounds of the proteids with\r\nmetallic oxids or bases, and also to acid and alkali albumins. They\r\nare insoluble in water or dilute neutral salts, but easily soluble in\r\nstrong acids or alkalies. Casein is a type of this group.\r\n\r\nAcid albumin is made from egg albumin by treatment with hydrochloric\r\nacid; alkali albumin is formed in egg albumin by the action of a dilute\r\nalkali; trinitroalbumin is formed from dry albumin by treatment with\r\nnitric acid; casein or caseinogen is the chief proteid in milk.\r\n\r\nThe chief vegetable albuminates are legumin and conglutin. Legumin\r\nis a vegetable casein and occurs chiefly in peas, beans and other\r\nleguminous seeds. It is prepared by extracting the meal of the seeds\r\nmentioned with dilute alkali, filtering the extract, precipitating with\r\nacetic acid, washing the precipitate with alcohol, and drying over\r\nsulfuric acid. Treated with sulfuric acid it yields leucin, tyrosin and\r\nglutamic and aspartic acids. Conglutin is prepared in a similar manner\r\nfrom almonds.\r\n\r\nIt is probable that these bodies do not exist as such in the fresh\r\nseeds in question but are produced therein from the other proteids\r\nby the alkali used in extraction. A further description of vegetable\r\nproteids will be found in the special paragraphs devoted to the study\r\nof these bodies in the principal cereals.\r\n\r\n_Proteoses._—This name is applied to proteids which are not coagulated\r\nby heat, but most of them are precipitated by saturated solutions of\r\nneutral salts. They are also precipitated by nitric acid. They are\r\nformed from other proteids by the action of proteolytic ferments. The\r\nalbumoses represent this group.\r\n\r\nProtoalbumose is soluble in distilled water and weak saline solutions\r\nand is precipitated by mercuric chlorid and copper sulfate.\r\n\r\nHeteroalbumose is insoluble in distilled water, but soluble in weak\r\nsaline solutions, from which it separates when the salts are removed\r\nby dialysis. Deuteroalbumose is soluble in distilled water and saline\r\nsolutions and is not precipitated on saturation with sodium chlorid. It\r\nis thrown out by mercuric chlorid but not by copper sulfate.\r\n\r\nVegetable proteoses are known as phytalbumoses, two of which have been\r\nfound in the juice of the papaw mentioned above. They have also been\r\nfound in cereals.\r\n\r\n_Peptones._—These bodies are very soluble in water but are not thrown\r\nout by heat, by saturation with neutral salts, nor by nitric acid. They\r\nare completely precipitated by tannin and by strong alcohol.\r\n\r\nThe peptones are the only soluble proteids which are not precipitated\r\nby saturation with ammonium sulfate. The principal animal varieties are\r\nhemi- and anti-peptones. These forms of proteids do not appear to exist\r\nas such in vegetable products but are produced in large quantities by\r\ntreating other proteids with pepsin or pancreatin. In sprouting plants,\r\nthere appears to be a widely diffused ferment capable of converting\r\nthe proteids of the cotyledons into peptonoid bodies and thus fitting\r\nthem for entering the tissues of the new plant.\r\n\r\n_Insoluble Proteids._—This class includes a miscellaneous collection\r\nof nitrogenous bodies not belonging to any of the definite groups\r\nalready mentioned. Fibrin and gluten are types of these insoluble\r\nbodies. Fibrin is formed from the fibrinogen of fresh blood and causes\r\ncoagulation. When washed free of red blood corpuscles it is a white\r\nelastic solid. It is insoluble in water and is converted into albumoses\r\nand peptones by trypsin and pepsin. It swells up when treated with\r\na very weak one-tenth per cent solution of hydrochloric acid and\r\ndissolves to acid albumin when heated therewith.\r\n\r\nGluten is the most important of the insoluble vegetable proteids and\r\nforms the chief part of the nitrogenous constituents of wheat. It is\r\nreadily prepared by washing wheat flour in cold water, as will be\r\ndescribed further on. It is probably a composite body formed by the\r\nprocess of extraction from at least two proteid bodies existing in\r\nwheat. When dried it forms a horny elastic mass of a yellow-gray color.\r\nGluten is composed of two bodies, one soluble the other insoluble\r\nin alcohol. The part insoluble in alcohol has been called vegetable\r\nfibrin, and the soluble part is subdivided into two portions, one\r\nunicedin or vegetable unicin, and the other glutin (gliadin) or\r\nvegetable gelatin. Gluten, according to some authorities, does not\r\nproperly exist in wheat flour, but is formed therein by the action\r\nof water and certain ferments from free existing proteids. A better\r\nexplanation of the composition of gluten is that of Osborne, which will\r\nbe given further on.\r\n\r\n=372. Albuminoids.=—In this paragraph the term albuminoids is not\r\nemployed as synonymous with proteids but as characteristic of a class\r\nof bodies nearly resembling them, but, nevertheless, differing from\r\nthem in many important particulars. Following is an abstract of their\r\nclassification as given in Watt’s dictionary.[340]\r\n\r\n_Collagen._—The nitrogenous portions of connective tissues are largely\r\ncomposed of collagen. By boiling water it is converted into gelatin.\r\nIt may be prepared from tendons as follows: The tendinous tissues are\r\nshredded as finely as possible and extracted with cold water to remove\r\nthe soluble proteids. Thereafter they are subjected for several days to\r\nthe action of lime water, which dissolves the cement holding the fibers\r\ntogether. The residual insoluble matter is washed with water, weak\r\nacetic acid, and again with water. The residue is chiefly collagen,\r\nmixed, however, with some elastin and nuclein. With dilute acids and\r\nalkalies collagen swells up after the manner of fibrin. The organic\r\nnitrogenous matter of bone consists largely of collagen, which is\r\nsometimes called ossein.\r\n\r\n_Gelatin._—When the white fibers of collagen, obtained as above, are\r\nsubjected to the action of boiling water or of steam under pressure\r\nthey dissolve and form gelatin. Isinglass is a gelatin made from the\r\nswimming bladder of the sturgeon or other fish. Glue is an impure\r\ngelatin obtained from hides and bones. Pure gelatin may be prepared\r\nfrom the commercial article by removing all soluble salts therefrom by\r\ntreatment with cold water, dissolving in hot water and filtering into\r\nninety per cent alcohol. The gelatin separates in the form of white\r\nfilaments and these are removed and dried. Gelatin is insoluble in\r\ncold but soluble in hot water. It is insoluble in alcohol, ether and\r\nchloroform. Its hot aqueous solutions deflect the plane of polarized\r\nlight to the left. Its gyrodynat varies with temperature and degree of\r\ndilution and is also influenced by acids and alkalies. At 30° it is\r\n[α]_{D}³⁰° = -130.\r\n\r\nGelatin is not precipitated by acetic acid nor lead acetate solution,\r\nin which respect it differs from chondrin.\r\n\r\nIf boiled for a day, or in a short time if heated to 140° in a sealed\r\ntube, gelatin loses its power of setting and is split up into two\r\npeptonoid bodies, semi-glutin and hemi-collin. Gelatin is easily\r\ndigested but cannot take the place of other proteids in nutrition.\r\n\r\n_Mucin._—This albuminoid, together with globulin, forms the principal\r\npart of connective tissue. It is also present in large quantities in\r\nmucus and is the chief lubricant of mucous membranes. It is extremely\r\ndifficult to prepare mucin in a state of purity, and it is not certain\r\nthat it has ever been accomplished. It is precipitated but not rendered\r\nsubsequently insoluble by sodium chlorid, magnesium sulfate and\r\nalcohol. When boiled with sulfuric acid it yields leucin and tyrosin\r\nand, with caustic soda, pyrocatechin.\r\n\r\n_Met- and Paralbumin._—Metalbumin is a form of mucin and differs from\r\nparalbumin by giving no precipitate when boiled. Both bodies yield\r\nreducing sugars when boiled with dilute sulfuric acid.\r\n\r\n_Nuclein._—The nitrogenous matters which form the nuclei of the\r\nultimate cells are called nuclein. Nuclein resembles mucin in many\r\nphysical properties but contains phosphorus. It is also, like mucin,\r\nresistant to pepsin digestion. The nuclein of eggs and milk probably\r\ncontains iron. Nuclein is found also in cells of vegetable origin and\r\nin yeast and mildew.\r\n\r\n_Nucleoproteids._—These are bodies which yield both nuclein and albumin\r\nwhen boiled with water or treated with dilute acids or alkalies. Many\r\nnucleoproteids have the physical properties of mucus and the sliminess\r\nof the bile and of the synovial liquid is due to them. They are the\r\nchief nitrogenous constituent of all protoplasm.\r\n\r\n_Chondrin._—Chondrin is obtained from cartilage by boiling with water.\r\nThe solutions of chondrin set on cooling in the manner of gelatin. They\r\nare precipitated by the same reagents used for throwing out gelatin and\r\nmucin. Chondrin is also levorotatory. By some authorities chondrin is\r\nregarded as a mixture of gelatin and mucin.\r\n\r\n_Elastin._—The elastic fibers of connective tissue are composed of\r\nthis material. It can be prepared from the neck muscles by boiling\r\nwith ether and alcohol to remove fats and then for a day and a half\r\nwith water to extract the collagens. The residue is boiled with strong\r\nacetic acid and thereafter with strong soda until the fibers begin to\r\nsmell. It is then treated with weak acetic acid and for a day with\r\ndilute hydrochloric acid. The acid is removed by washing with water\r\nand the residue is elastin. There is no solvent which acts on elastin\r\nwithout decomposing it. It is digested by both pepsin and trypsin with\r\nthe formation of peptones.\r\n\r\n_Keratin._—This nitrogenous substance is found chiefly in hairs,\r\nnails, and horns. It is essentially an alteration proteid product due\r\nto peripheral exposure. It is prepared by digesting the fine ground\r\nmaterial successively with ether, alcohol, water and dilute acids. The\r\nresidue is keratin. An imperfect aqueous solution may be secured by\r\nheating for a long time under pressure to 200°. It is also dissolved\r\nby boiling the materials mentioned above with alkalies, and when the\r\nsolution thus obtained is treated with water, hydrogen sulfid is\r\nevolved, showing that the sulfur of the molecule is loosely combined.\r\n\r\nHorn swells up when treated with dilute acetic acid and dissolves in\r\nthe boiling glacial acid. When treated with hot dilute sulfuric acid it\r\nyields aspartic and volatile fat acids, leucin and tyrosin. Keratin,\r\nwhen burning, gives off a characteristic odor as is perceived in\r\nburning hair.\r\n\r\n_Other Albuminoids._—Among the albuminoids of less importance may be\r\nmentioned neurokeratin found in the medullary sheath of nerve fibers;\r\nchitin occurring in the tissues of certain invertebrates; conchiolin,\r\nfound in the shells of mussels and snails; spongin, occurring in\r\nsponges; fibroin forming silk and spiders webs; and hyalin or hyalogen\r\nfound in edible birds’ nests.\r\n\r\nThe nitrogenous bases in flesh which are soluble in cold water,\r\n_viz._, kreatin, kreatinin, carnin, sarkin and xanthin are not classed\r\namong the albuminoid bodies, since they have a much higher percentage\r\nof nitrogen than is found in true proteid bodies, and are further\r\ndifferentiated from them by the absence of sulfur.\r\n\r\n=373. Other Forms of Nitrogen.=—In addition to the proteids and\r\nalbuminoids mentioned above, agricultural products may contain nitrogen\r\nin the form of ammonia, amid nitrogen and nitric acid. The quantities\r\nof nitrogen thus combined are not large but often of sufficient\r\nmagnitude to demand special study. In general, these bodies belong to\r\ntransition products, representing stages in the transfer of nitrogen\r\nfrom the simple to complex forms of combination, or the reverse.\r\n\r\nFor instance, the nitrogen which finally appears in the proteids\r\nof a plant has entered its organism chiefly as nitric acid, and\r\nthe nitric acid which is found in a vegetable product is therefore\r\na representative of the quantity of unabsorbed nitrogen present in\r\nthe tissues at the moment when the vital activity of the plant is\r\narrested. In some instances, it is found that the absorption of\r\nnitrates by vegetable tissues takes place in far larger quantities than\r\nis necessary for their nutrition, and in these cases the excess of\r\nnitrates accumulates, sometimes to a remarkable extent. In a case cited\r\nin the reports of the Kansas Agricultural Experiment Station, where\r\nIndian corn was grown on ground which had been used for a hog pen, the\r\nquantity of potassium nitrate found in the dried stalks was somewhat\r\nremarkable. When one of the stalks was cut in two and tapped lightly\r\nupon a table, crystals of potassium nitrate were easily obtained in the\r\nform of fine powder. On splitting the cornstalk the crystals in the\r\npith could be seen without the aid of a microscope. On igniting a piece\r\nof the dried stalk it burned rapidly with deflagration. The percentage\r\nof potassium nitrate in the dried material was 18.8. Cattle eating this\r\nfodder were poisoned.[341]\r\n\r\nIn preserved meat products large quantities of oxidized nitrogen are\r\noften found, and these come from the use of potassium nitrate as a\r\npreserving and coloring agent. Ammonia is rarely found in vegetable\r\ntissues in greater quantities than mere traces, but may often exist in\r\nweighable amounts in animal products.\r\n\r\nAmid nitrogen is found rather constantly associated with proteid\r\nmatters in vegetable products. Asparagin and glutamin are instances\r\nof amid bodies of frequent occurrence. Betain and cholin are found in\r\ncottonseed.\r\n\r\nThe occurrence of nitrogen, in the form of alkaloids, is of interest\r\nto agricultural chemists in this country, chiefly from its presence\r\nas nicotin in tobacco and from a toxicological point of view, but\r\nin other localities the production of alkaloids, as for instance in\r\nopium, tea and coffee, is a staple agricultural industry. The methods\r\nof separating and determining these forms of nitrogen will be given\r\nfurther on. This description can evidently not include an extended\r\ncompilation of the methods of separating and determining alkaloidal\r\nbodies, with the exception of those with which the agricultural\r\nanalyst will be called upon frequently to deal, _viz._, nicotin and\r\ncaffein and nitrogenous bases such as betain and cholin.\r\n\r\n\r\nQUALITIVE TESTS FOR NITROGENOUS BODIES.\r\n\r\n=374. Nitric Acid.=—Any nitric acid or nitrate which an agricultural\r\nproduct may contain may be leached out by treating the fine-ground\r\nmaterial with cold water. From vegetable matters this extract is\r\nevaporated to a small bulk, filtered, if necessary, and tested for\r\nnitric acid by the usual treatment with ferrous sulfate and sulfuric\r\nacid. In the case of vegetable substances there will not usually\r\nbe enough of organic matter to interfere with the delicacy of the\r\nreaction, but in animal extracts this may occur. Colored extracts\r\nshould be decolorized with animal char (bone-black) before they are\r\nsubjected to examination. It is not well to attempt to remove the\r\norganic matters, but, since they are more insoluble in water than the\r\nnitrates, the solution containing both may be evaporated to dryness\r\nand treated with a quantity of cold water insufficient for complete\r\nsolution. The nitrates will be found in the solution obtained in a\r\nlarger proportionate quantity than before.\r\n\r\n=375. Amid Nitrogen.=—One or more atoms of the hydrogen in ammonia may\r\nbe replaced by acid or basic bodies (alcohol radicles). In the former\r\ncases amids, in the latter amins result. In the ratio of displacement\r\nthere are formed primary, secondary, and tertiary bodies determined by\r\nthe number of hydrogen atoms replaced. The primary amids are the only\r\nones of these bodies that are of interest in this connection.\r\n\r\nThe amids are easily decomposed, even on heating with water and the\r\nmore readily with acids and alkalies, the amido radicle being converted\r\ninto ammonia. A type of these reactions is given below.\r\n\r\n    CH₃.CO.NH₂ + H₂O = CH₂.CO.OH + H₃N.\r\n\r\nOn boiling an amid with hydrochloric acid, the ammonia is procured\r\nas chlorid whence it is easily expelled by heating with an alkali.\r\nIn a body free of ammonia, an amid is easily detected by subjecting\r\nthe substance containing it to the action of hot hydrochloric acid,\r\nfiltering, neutralizing the free acid with sodium hydroxid, adding an\r\nexcess thereof and distilling into an acid.[342] In case the quantity\r\nof ammonia produced is very small it may be detected by the nessler\r\nreagent.[343] Amids are soluble in a fresh, well washed preparation\r\nof cupric hydrate suspended in water. The hydrate also passes into\r\nsolution forming a liquid of a deep blue color.\r\n\r\nIf amids be added to a cold solution of potassium nitrate in sulfuric\r\nacid free nitrogen is evolved.\r\n\r\n=376. Ammoniacal Nitrogen.=—This combination of nitrogen may be\r\ndetected by distilling the sample, or an aqueous extract thereof, with\r\nmagnesia or barium carbonate. The ammonia is collected in an acid and\r\ndetected therein by the usual qualitive reactions.\r\n\r\n=377. Proteid Nitrogen.=—There are a few general qualitive reactions\r\nfor proteid nitrogen and some special ones for distinct forms thereof.\r\nBelow will be given a few of those reactions which are of most\r\nimportance to the agricultural analyst:\r\n\r\n_Conversion into Ammonia._—All proteid matters are converted into\r\nammonia on boiling with strong sulfuric acid in presence of an oxygen\r\ncarrier. Mercury is the substance usually selected to effect the\r\ntransfer of the oxygen. Bodies which are found to be free of nitrates,\r\nammonia and amids, are subjected directly to oxidation with sulfuric\r\nacid, and the ammonia produced thereby is distilled and detected in\r\nthe manner already suggested. If nitrogen be present in the form of\r\nammonia, amids and nitrates, the substance may be heated with an acid,\r\nhydrochloric or acetic, thrown on a filter, washed with hot dilute acid\r\nand the residue tested as above for proteid nitrogen.\r\n\r\n_Biuret Reaction._—When proteid matter is dissolved in sulfuric acid,\r\nthe solution, made alkaline with potassium hydroxid and treated with a\r\nfew drops of a solution of copper sulfate, gives a violet coloration.\r\nThis is commonly known as the biuret reaction, because the substance\r\nC₂H₆N₃O₂, biuret, left on heating urea to 160° gives the coloration\r\nnoted in the conditions mentioned.\r\n\r\nIt has been found by Bigelow, in this laboratory, that if a solution is\r\nto be examined containing a very small amount of a proteid or similar\r\nbody, the copper sulfate solution should not contain more than four\r\ngrams of CuSO₄.5H₂O in 100 cubic centimeters of water, and the test\r\nshould first be made by adding to the solution one or two drops of\r\nthis copper sulfate solution, and then a strong excess of potassium\r\nor sodium hydroxid. The test may be repeated, using from one-half to\r\ntwo cubic centimeters of the copper sulfate solution, according to the\r\namount of proteid present. If too much of the copper sulfate solution\r\nbe employed its color may conceal that of the reaction.\r\n\r\nHeating to the boiling point sometimes makes the violet color more\r\ndistinct.\r\n\r\nIf a solid is to be examined it is first suspended in water, and in\r\nthis state treated in the same manner as a solution. If solution is not\r\ncomplete, the mixture should be filtered when the color produced may be\r\nobserved in the filtrate.\r\n\r\nProteoses and peptones give a red to red-violet and other proteids a\r\nviolet to violet-blue coloration.\r\n\r\n_Xanthoproteic Reaction._—Strong nitric acid produces a yellow\r\ncoloration of proteid matter, which is intensified on warming. On\r\ntreating the yellow mixture with ammonia in slight excess the color is\r\nchanged to an orange or red tint.\r\n\r\n=378. Qualitive Tests for Albumin.=—Albumin is one of the chief\r\nproteids and exists in both animal and vegetable substances. It is\r\nsoluble in cold water and may therefore be separated from many of its\r\nnearly related bodies which are insoluble in that menstruum. In aqueous\r\nsolutions its presence may be determined by the general reactions for\r\nproteid matters given above or by the following tests:\r\n\r\n_Precipitation by Heat._—Albumin is coagulated by heat. Vegetable\r\nalbumins become solid at about 65° and those of animal origin at a\r\nsomewhat higher temperature (75°). Some forms of animal albumin,\r\nhowever, as for instance that contained in the serum, coagulate at a\r\nlower temperature.\r\n\r\n_Precipitation by Acids._—Dilute acids also precipitate albumins\r\nespecially with the aid of heat. Practically all the albumins are\r\nthrown out of solution by application of heat in the presence of dilute\r\nacids.\r\n\r\n_Mercuric Salts._—Acid mercuric nitrate and a mixture of mercuric\r\nchlorid, potassium iodid and acetic acid completely precipitate all\r\nalbuminous matters.[344]\r\n\r\nThe yellow or red color produced on heating albumin with the mercuric\r\nnitrate is known as Million’s reaction.\r\n\r\n=379. Qualitive Test for Peptones and Albuminates.=—When peptones and\r\nalbuminates are dissolved in an excess of glacial acetic acid and the\r\nsolution treated with sulfuric acid a violet color is produced and also\r\na faint fluorescence.\r\n\r\n_Separation of Peptones and Albumoses._—In a solution of peptones and\r\nalbumoses the latter may be precipitated by saturating the solution\r\nwith finely powdered zinc or ammonium sulfate.\r\n\r\n_Action of Phosphotungstic Acid._—All proteid matters in aqueous,\r\nalkaline or acid solutions, are precipitated by sodium phosphotungstate\r\nin a strongly acid solution. Acetic, phosphoric, or sulfuric acid may\r\nbe used for producing the required acidity, preference being given to\r\nthe latter.\r\n\r\n_Action of Trichloracetic Acid._—In the precipitation of albumin by\r\ntrichloracetic acid, there is formed a compound of the two bodies which\r\nto 100 parts of albumin has 26.8 parts of the trichloracetic acid.\r\n\r\nThe different albuminoid bodies obtained by precipitation behave in\r\na similar manner. There are formed flocculent precipitates insoluble\r\nboth in dilute and concentrated acids in the cold and also at a high\r\ntemperature, with the exception of the hemialbumose compound.[345]\r\n\r\nAlbumin peptone, however, gives with the acid named in concentrated\r\nsolution a precipitate easily soluble in an excess of the reagent. In\r\nthe analysis of cow’s milk but not of human milk, this acid can be used\r\nfor the estimation of the albuminoid substances. With both kinds of\r\nmilk it can be used for the estimation of the albumin after the removal\r\nof the casein.\r\n\r\nAfter precipitation of the albuminoid bodies, the milk sugar can be\r\nestimated by polarizing the filtrate and, volumetrically after removal\r\nof the excess of the acid by evaporation. By means of trichloracetic\r\nacid it is possible to separate albumin peptone from mucus and mucus\r\npeptone. A similar reaction is also produced by dichloracetic acid, but\r\nthe reaction with this last agent is less delicate than with the other.\r\nNeither mucus nor albumin is precipitated by chloracetic acid.\r\n\r\n=380. Action of Albumins on Polarized Light.=—Many of the albumins and\r\nalbuminates, when in solution, strongly deflect the plane of polarized\r\nlight to the left.[346]\r\n\r\nThe gyrodynats of some of the albumins and albuminates are given below:\r\n\r\n    Serum albumin  [α]_{D} = -57°.3 to -64°.6.\r\n    Egg albumin    [α]_{D} = -35°.5 to -38°.1.\r\n    Serum globulin [α]_{D} = -47°.8.\r\n    Milk albumin   [α]_{D} = -76°.0 to -91°.0.\r\n\r\nOur knowledge of the gyrodynatic numbers of the proteids and allied\r\nbodies is too fragmentary to be of any great help in analytical work.\r\nIn practice, the rotatory power of these bodies becomes a disturbing\r\nforce in the determination of milk sugar.[347] A further study of this\r\nproperty of certain proteids may lead to analytical processes for their\r\ndetection and determination, but no reliable methods for this can now\r\nbe recorded.\r\n\r\n=381. Alkaloidal Nitrogen.=—Only a general statement can be made here\r\nin respect of the detection of alkaloidal nitrogen in vegetable or\r\nanimal tissues. Alkaloids are not found in healthy animal tissues and\r\nthe description of methods for isolating and detecting ptomaines is\r\nforeign to the purpose of this work. In vegetable tissues the presence\r\nof alkaloids may be established by the following methods of examination.\r\n\r\nThe fine-ground tissues are made to pass a sieve of half millimeter\r\nmesh and when suspended in water are acidified with sulfuric. The\r\nmixture is then thoroughly extracted by shaking in a separatory funnel\r\nwith petroleum ether, benzene and chloroform, successively. Some\r\nresins, glucosids and a few alkaloidal bodies not important here are\r\nextracted by this treatment.\r\n\r\nThe residue is made distinctly alkaline with ammonia and treated\r\nas above with the same solvents. In the solution obtained as last\r\nmentioned nearly all the alkaloidal bodies found in plants are\r\ncontained.\r\n\r\nAll the alkaloids in a plant may be obtained by digesting the finely\r\ndivided material with dilute sulfuric acid. The acid solution thus\r\nobtained is made nearly neutral with ammonia or magnesia, concentrated\r\nto a sirup, and gums, mucilage, etc. thrown out by adding about three\r\nvolumes of ninety-five per cent alcohol. The alkaloids are found in the\r\nfiltrate. The alcohol is evaporated from the filtrate and the residue\r\ntested for alkaloids by group reagents.[348] Potassium mercuric iodid\r\nand phosphotungstic and molybdic acids are types of these reagents.\r\n\r\nThe same group reagents may also be applied to the extracts obtained\r\nwith petroleum ether, benzene and chloroform, in all cases, after the\r\nremoval of the solvents by evaporation.\r\n\r\n\r\nESTIMATION OF NITROGENOUS BODIES IN AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS.\r\n\r\n=382. Total Nitrogen.=—Any one of the methods heretofore described for\r\nthe estimation of total nitrogen in soils or fertilizers is applicable\r\nfor the same purpose to agricultural products. One among these,\r\nhowever, is so superior in the matter of convenience and certainty, as\r\nto make it preferable to any other. The moist combustion of the sample\r\nwith sulfuric acid with subsequent distillation of the ammonia produced\r\nis the process which is to be recommended.[349]\r\n\r\nThe usual precautions for securing a representative sample should be\r\nobserved, but no further directions are needed. In all cases hereafter,\r\nwhere the estimation of nitrogen is enjoined, it is understood that the\r\nmoist combustion process is to be used unless otherwise stated.\r\n\r\n=383. Estimation of Ammoniacal Nitrogen.=—If the distillation of\r\nammonia be accomplished with the aid of magnesia alba or barium\r\ncarbonate it may be safely conducted on the finely ground materials\r\nor, in case of animal bodies, in as fine a state of subdivision as\r\nmay be conveniently secured. Since the salts of ammonia are easily\r\nsoluble in water they may be all obtained in aqueous solution, and the\r\ndistillation of this solution with magnesia gives correct results.\r\nExperience has shown that the stronger alkalies, such as sodium and\r\npotassium hydroxids, cannot be safely used in the distillation of\r\nammonia from mixtures containing organic nitrogenous materials because\r\nof the tendency of these bodies to decomposition, in the circumstances,\r\nyielding a portion of their nitrogen as ammonia. Barium carbonate acts\r\nwith less vigor on non-ammoniacal nitrogenous matters than magnesia,\r\nand in some cases, as pointed out further on, may be substituted\r\ntherefor with advantage. There is no danger of failing to obtain a part\r\nof the ammonia on distillation with magnesia provided the latter does\r\nnot contain more than a trace of carbonate.[350]\r\n\r\nWhen no easily decomposable organic nitrogenous matters are present,\r\nthe distillation may be conducted with the stronger alkalies in the\r\nmanner prescribed.[351] All the necessary details of conducting the\r\ndistillation are found in the preceding volumes of this work.\r\n\r\n=384. Estimation of Amid Nitrogen.=—In bodies containing no ammonia,\r\nor from which the ammonia has been removed by the method described in\r\nthe preceding paragraph, the nitrogen in the amid bodies is converted\r\ninto ammonia by boiling for about an hour with five per cent sulfuric\r\nor hydrochloric acid. The ammonia thus produced is estimated in the\r\nusual manner after distillation over magnesia free of carbonate. The\r\nfree acid is exactly neutralized with sodium or potassium carbonate\r\nbefore the addition of the magnesia. The results are given in terms of\r\nasparagin. The reaction which takes place in the decomposition of the\r\namid body is indicated by the following equation:\r\n\r\n    Asparagin.      Sulfuric  Aspartic   Ammonium\r\n                      acid.     acid.     sulfate.\r\n    2C₄H₈N₂O₃ + 2H₂O + H₂SO₄ = 2C₄H₇NO₄ + (H₄N)₂SO₄.\r\n\r\nHalf of the nitrogen contained in the amid body is thus obtained as\r\nammonia.\r\n\r\nIt is advisable to calculate all the amid nitrogen in agricultural\r\nproducts as asparagin.\r\n\r\n=385. Sachsse’s Method.=—A method for the determination of amid\r\nbodies by liberation of free nitrogen has been described by Sachsse\r\nand Kormann.[352] It is based on the reaction which takes place when\r\namid bodies are brought into contact with nitrites in presence of an\r\nacid. The mixture of the reagents by which the gas is set free is\r\naccomplished in the apparatus shown in Fig. 103. The vessel _A_ has a\r\ncapacity of about fifty cubic centimeters and carries a stopper with\r\nthree perforations for the arrangement shown.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 103.—APPARATUS FOR AMID NITROGEN.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 104.—SACHSSE’S EUDIOMETER.]\r\n\r\nAbout six cubic centimeters of a concentrated aqueous solution of\r\npotassium nitrite are placed in _A_ and the lower parts of the tubes\r\n_a_ and _b_ are filled with water to a little above _e_ in order to\r\nexclude the air therefrom. Dilute sulfuric acid is placed in one of\r\nthe funnels and an aqueous solution of the amid in the other. The air\r\nis displaced from the empty part of _A_ by introducing the sulfuric\r\nacid, a little at a time, whereby nitrous acid and nitric oxid are\r\nevolved. This operation is continued until all the air has been driven\r\nout through _c d_, the open end of _d_ being kept in the liquid in the\r\ndish shown in Fig. 104. The eudiometer in which the evolved nitrogen\r\nis measured is shown in Fig. 104, and should have a capacity of about\r\nfifty cubic centimeters, and be graduated to fifths. It is filled\r\nwith the solution of ferrous sulfate contained in _B_ by sucking at\r\n_g_, after which the clamp _h_ is replaced, the cock _f_ closed, and\r\nthe free end of _d_ placed in the lower end of the eudiometer. The\r\nsolution of the amid is run slowly into the generator _A_, Fig. 103,\r\ntogether with small additional quantities of the sulfuric acid when\r\nthe evolution of gas becomes slow. From time to time _h_ is opened\r\nand fresh quantities of the ferrous solution allowed to flow into the\r\neudiometer. Any trace of the amid remaining in the funnel is washed\r\ninto _A_ with pure water, with care to avoid the introduction of air.\r\nWhen the liquid in _A_ assumes a permanent blue color the decomposition\r\nis complete. The residual gas is driven out of _A_ by filling with\r\nwater. The tubes _d_ and _h_, after all the nitric oxid is absorbed,\r\nare removed from the eudiometer which is transferred to a cylinder\r\ncontaining water and immersed therein until the two liquid surfaces\r\nare at the same level and the volume of the nitrogen observed. After\r\ncorrection for temperature and pressure, the weight of the nitrogen is\r\ncalculated. Twenty-eight parts by weight of nitrogen correspond to 150\r\nof pure asparagin, 181 of tyrosin and 131 of leucin.[353] This method of\r\nprocedure is difficult of manipulation and is apt to give results that\r\nare too high. It cannot be preferred to the more simple and accurate\r\nprocesses already described.\r\n\r\n=386. Preparation of Asparagin.=—In case the analyst desires to prepare\r\na quantity of asparagin for comparative purposes it may be easily\r\naccomplished in the following way: A sufficient quantity of pease\r\nor beans is sprouted in a dark place and allowed to grow until the\r\nreserve food of the seed is exhausted. The young sprouts are gathered,\r\nshredded and subjected to strong pressure. The juice thus obtained is\r\nboiled to coagulate the albumin, and thrown on a filter. The filtrate\r\nis evaporated to a thin sirup and set aside to allow the asparagin\r\nto separate in a crystallized form. If the crystals at first formed\r\nare colored they may be dissolved, decolorized with bone-black, and\r\nrecrystallized. Instead of the above method the young shoots may be\r\nshredded, extracted with hot water and the extract treated as above. A\r\nlarger yield of the asparagin is obtained by the latter process than by\r\nthe one mentioned above.[354]\r\n\r\n=387. Detection and Estimation of Asparagin and Glutamin.=—Of all\r\nthe amid bodies asparagin is the most important from an agricultural\r\nstandpoint, because of its wide distribution in vegetable products.[355]\r\nAsparagin is easily obtained from the aqueous extracts of plants by\r\ncrystallization.[356] In addition to its crystalline characteristics\r\nasparagin may be identified by the following tests. Heated with\r\nalkalies, including barium hydroxid, asparagin yields ammonia. Boiled\r\nwith dilute acids it forms ammonium salts. A warm aqueous solution\r\ndissolves freshly prepared copper hydroxid with the production of a\r\ndeep blue color. Sometimes, on cooling, crystals of the copper compound\r\nformed are separated. Asparagin crystallizes with one molecule of\r\nwater. Glutamin gives essentially the reactions characteristic of\r\nasparagin, but crystallizes without water in small white needles.\r\nAsparagin is easily detected with the aid of the microscope by placing\r\nsections of vegetable tissues containing it in alcohol. After some\r\ntime microscopic crystals of asparagin are separated. The presence of\r\nlarge quantities of soluble carbohydrates seriously interferes with the\r\nseparation of asparagin in crystalline form.\r\n\r\nFor the detection of glutamin the liquid containing it is boiled with\r\ndilute hydrochloric acid, by which ammonia and glutamic acid are\r\nformed. On the addition of lead acetate to the solution the glutamic\r\nacid is thrown out as a lead salt, in which, after its decomposition\r\nwith hydrogen sulfid, the characteristic properties of glutamic acid\r\ncan be established.\r\n\r\nThe above process is chronophagous and also uncertain where the\r\nquantity of glutamin is very small and that of other soluble organic\r\nmatters very large. A much better process, both for the detection\r\nof glutamin and asparagin, is the following, based on the property\r\npossessed by mercuric nitrate of precipitating amids.\r\n\r\nThe aqueous extract containing the amid bodies is mixed with lead\r\nacetate until all precipitable matters are thrown out and the mixture\r\npoured into a filter. To the filtrate is added a moderately acid\r\nsolution of mercuric nitrate. The precipitate produced is collected\r\non a filter, washed, suspended in water, decomposed with hydrogen\r\nsulfid and again filtered. The amid bodies (glutamin, asparagin, etc.)\r\nare found in the filtrate and can be detected and estimated by the\r\nprocesses already described. A reaction showing the presence of an amid\r\nbody is not a positive proof of the presence of asparagin or glutamin,\r\nsince among other amids, allantoin may be present. This substance is\r\nfound in the sprouts of young plants and also in certain cereals, as\r\nshown by researches in this laboratory.[357] Allantoin, glutamin, and\r\nasparagin, when obtained in solution by the above process, may be\r\nsecured, by careful evaporation and recrystallization, in well defined\r\ncrystalline forms. Asparagin gives lustrous, rhombic prisms, easily\r\nsoluble in hot water, but insoluble in alcohol and ether.\r\n\r\nAllantoin is regarded as a diureid of glyoxalic acid and has the\r\ncomposition represented by the formula C₄H₆N₄O₃. It crystallizes in\r\nlustrous prisms having practically the same solubility as asparagin.\r\n\r\nGlutamin is the amid of amidoglutaric acid. It crystallizes in fine\r\nneedles. Its structural formula is represented as\r\n\r\n            CO.NH₂\r\n           /\r\n    C₃H₅(NH₂)\r\n           \\\r\n            CO₂H.\r\n\r\n=387. Cholin and Betain.=—Cholin is a nitrogenous base found in both\r\nanimal and plant tissues. Its name is derived from the circumstance\r\nthat it was first discovered in the bile. It is found in the brain,\r\nyolk of eggs, hops, beets, cottonseed and many other bodies. When\r\nunited with glycerolphosphoric acid it forms lecithin, a compound of\r\ngreat physiological importance. From a chemical point of view, cholin\r\nis oxyethyltrimethyl-ammonium hydroxid,\r\n\r\n        OH\r\n       /\r\n    C₂H₄          ; (C₅H₁₅NO₂).\r\n       \\\r\n        N(CH₃)₃.OH\r\n\r\nIt is crystallized with difficulty and is deliquescent. Its most\r\nimportant compound, from an analytical point of view, is its platinum\r\nsalt C₅H₁₄ONCl₂PtCl₄. This salt crystallizes in red-yellow plates and\r\nis insoluble in alcohol.\r\n\r\nBetain, C₅H₁₁NO₂, is the product of the oxidation of cholin.\r\n\r\nIn this laboratory the bases are separated from cottonseed and from\r\neach other by the process described below.[358]\r\n\r\nAbout five pounds of fine-ground cottonseed cake are extracted with\r\nseventy per cent alcohol. The material should not be previously treated\r\nwith dilute mineral acids because of the danger of converting a part\r\nof the cholin into betain. The alcohol is removed from the filtered\r\nextract and the residue dissolved in water. The aqueous solution is\r\ntreated with lead acetate until no further precipitation takes place,\r\nthrown on a filter, the lead removed from the filtrate with hydrogen\r\nsulfid and the liquid evaporated to a viscous syrup. The sirup is\r\nextracted with alcohol containing one per cent of hydrochloric acid.\r\nThe solution thus obtained is placed in a deep beaker and the bases\r\nprecipitated by means of an alcoholic solution of mercuric chlorid. The\r\ncomplete separation of the salts requires at least two weeks.\r\n\r\nThe double salts of the bases and mercury thus obtained, after freeing\r\nfrom the mother liquor, are recrystallized from a solution in water\r\nand from the pure product thus obtained the mercury is removed after\r\nsolution in water, by hydrogen sulfid. The filtrate, after separating\r\nthe mercury, contains the bases as chlorids (hydrochlorates). The\r\nsolution of the chlorids is evaporated slowly in (pene) vacuo to a\r\nthick sirup and set over sulfuric acid to facilitate crystallization.\r\nThe hydrochlorates are obtained in this way colorless and in\r\nwell-shaped crystalline forms.\r\n\r\nIn a quantitive determination, a small amount of the fine meal is\r\nextracted at once with one per cent hydrochloric acid in seventy per\r\ncent alcohol, the salts obtained purified as above and weighed.\r\n\r\nThe following process serves to determine the relative proportions of\r\ncholin and betain in a mixture of the two bases.\r\n\r\nA definite weight of the chlorids, prepared as directed above, is\r\nextracted by absolute alcohol. This treatment dissolves all the cholin\r\nchlorid and a little of the betain salt. The alcoholic solution is\r\nevaporated and again extracted with absolute alcohol. This process is\r\nrepeated three times and at the end the cholin chlorid is obtained free\r\nof betain. In a sample of cottonseed cake examined in this laboratory\r\nthe two bases were found present in the following relative proportions,\r\n_viz._, cholin 17.5 per cent, betain 82.5 per cent. Thus purified the\r\ncholin is finally precipitated by platinum chlorid. For a description\r\nof the special reaction, by means of which cholin and betain are\r\ndifferentiated, the paper cited above may be consulted.\r\n\r\nThese bodies have acquired an economic interest on account of their\r\noccurrence in cottonseed meal, which is so extensively used as a\r\ncattle food. It is evident from the relative proportions in which they\r\noccur that the less nocuous base, betain, is the more abundant. It is\r\npossible, however, that the base originally formed is cholin and that\r\nbetain is a secondary product.\r\n\r\nExperience has shown that it is not safe to feed cottonseed meal to\r\nvery young animals, while moderate rations thereof may be given to\r\nfull-grown animals without much expectation of deleterious results. In\r\nthe case of toxic effects it is fair to presume that a meal has been\r\nfed in which the cholin is relatively more abundant than the betain.\r\n\r\n=389. Lecithin.=—Lecithin is a nitrogenous body, allied both to the\r\nfats and proteids and containing glycerol and phosphoric acid. Its\r\npercentage composition is represented with some accuracy by the formula\r\nC₄₂H₈₆NPO₉, or according to Hoppe-Seyler, C₄₄H₉₀NPO₉. It appears to\r\nbe a compound of cholin with glycerolphosphoric acid. It is widely\r\ndistributed both in animal and vegetable organisms, in the latter\r\nespecially in pease and beans.\r\n\r\nFrom a physiological point of view, lecithin is highly important as the\r\nmedium for the passage of phosphorus from the organic to the inorganic\r\nstate, and the reverse. This function of lecithin has been thoroughly\r\ninvestigated in this laboratory by Maxwell.[359]\r\n\r\nIn the extraction of lecithin from seeds (pease, beans, etc.) it is not\r\npossible to secure the whole of the substance by treatment with ether\r\nalone.[360]\r\n\r\nThe extraction of the lecithin may, however, be entirely accomplished\r\nby successive treatments for periods of about fifteen hours with pure\r\nether and alcohol. This is better than to mix the solvents, since, in\r\nthis case, the ether having the lower boiling point is chiefly active\r\nin the extraction. When the extraction is accomplished by digestion\r\nand not in a continuous extracting apparatus the two solvents may be\r\nmixed together and thus used with advantage. After the evaporation of\r\nthe solvents, the lecithin is ignited with mixed sodium and potassium\r\ncarbonate whereby the organic phosphorus is secured without loss in an\r\ninorganic form. Where greater care is desired, the method described for\r\norganic phosphorus in soils may be used.[361] The inorganic phosphorus\r\nthus obtained is estimated in the usual way as magnesium pyrophosphate.\r\n\r\nFor analytical purposes, the extraction of lecithin from vegetable\r\nsubstances is conducted in this laboratory as follows:[362] The\r\nfine-ground pea or bean meal is placed in an extraction apparatus\r\nand treated continuously with anhydrous ether for fifteen hours. The\r\nether in the apparatus is replaced with absolute alcohol and the\r\nextraction continued for six hours longer. The alcoholic extract is\r\nevaporated to dryness and treated with ether. The part of the lecithin\r\nat first insoluble in ether becomes soluble therein after it has been\r\nremoved from the vegetable tissues by alcohol. Moreover, any trace of\r\ninorganic phosphorus which may have been removed by the alcohol, is\r\nleft undissolved on subsequent treatment with ether. The ether extract\r\nfrom the alcohol residue is added to that obtained directly, the ether\r\nremoved by evaporation, and the total lecithin oxidized and the residue\r\nused for the estimation of phosphorus as already described.\r\n\r\nIn determining the lecithin in eggs, the procedure employed for\r\nvegetable tissues is slightly changed.[363] The whole egg, excluding\r\nthe shell, is placed in a flask with a reflux condenser and boiled for\r\nsix hours with absolute alcohol. The alcohol is then removed from the\r\nflask by evaporation and the residue treated in like manner with ether\r\nfor ten hours. The ether is removed and the dry residue rubbed to a\r\nfine powder, placed in an extractor and treated with pure ether for\r\nten hours. The extract thus secured is oxidized after the removal of\r\nthe ether by fusion with mixed alkaline carbonates and the phosphorus\r\ndetermined in the usual way.\r\n\r\n=390. Factor for Calculating Results.=—The percentage of lecithin is\r\ncalculated from the weight of magnesium pyrophosphate obtained by\r\nmultiplying it by the factor, 7.2703.[364] This factor is calculated\r\nfrom the second formula for lecithin given above, in which the\r\npercentage of phosphorus pentoxid, P₂O₅, is 8.789.\r\n\r\n_Example._—In fifty-four grams of egg, exclusive of the shell, is found\r\nan amount of organic phosphorus yielding 0.0848 gram of magnesium\r\npyrophosphate. Then 0.0848 × 7.2703 = 0.61652 and 0.61652 × 100 ÷ 54 =\r\n1.14. Therefore the percentage of lecithin in the egg is 1.14.\r\n\r\n=391. Estimation of Alkaloidal Nitrogen.=—The alkaloids contain\r\nnitrogen in a form more difficult of oxidation than that contained in\r\nproteid or albuminoid forms. It is doubtful whether any of the nitrogen\r\nin alkaloids becomes available for plant nutrition by any of the usual\r\nprocesses of fermentation and decay to which nitrogenous bodies are\r\nsubmitted in the soil. Likewise, it is true that it is not attacked by\r\nthe digestive processes in any way preparatory to its assimilation as\r\nfood by the animal tissues. Alkaloidal nitrogen is therefore not to be\r\nregarded as a food either for the animal or plant.\r\n\r\nFor the general methods of estimating alkaloids the reader is referred\r\nto standard works on plant chemistry and toxicology. The alkaloids of\r\ninterest in this manual are those which are found in tobacco, tea,\r\ncoffee and a few other products of agricultural importance. The best\r\nmethods of isolating and estimating these bodies will be given in the\r\npart of the volume devoted to the special consideration of the articles\r\nmentioned.\r\n\r\n\r\nSEPARATION OF PROTEID BODIES IN VEGETABLE PRODUCTS.\r\n\r\n=392. Preliminary Treatment.=—The chief disturbing components of\r\nvegetable tissues, in respect of their influence on the separation\r\nand estimation of the proteid constituents, are fats and oils and\r\ncoloring matters. In many cases these bodies are present in such\r\nsmall quantities as to be negligible, as, for instance, in rice. In\r\nother cases they exist in such large proportions as to present almost\r\ninsuperable difficulties to analytical operations, as is the case with\r\noily seeds. In all instances, however, it is best to remove these\r\nbodies, even when present in small proportions, provided it can be done\r\nwithout altering the character of the proteid bodies. This is secured\r\nby extracting the fine-ground vegetable material first with petroleum\r\nether, and afterwards with strong alcohol and ether. Practically, all\r\nof the fatty bodies and the greater part of the most objectionable\r\ncoloring matters are removed by this treatment. The extraction should\r\nin all cases be made at low temperatures, not exceeding 35°, to avoid\r\nthe coagulating effect of higher temperatures upon the albuminous\r\nbodies which may be present.\r\n\r\nIn this laboratory, fatty seeds, as for instance peanuts, are first\r\nground into coarse meal, then extracted with petroleum ether, ground\r\nto a fine meal and the fat extraction completed with petroleum ether,\r\nninety-five per cent alcohol and pure sulfuric ether. The residue of\r\nthe last solvent may be removed by aspirating air through the extracted\r\nmeal. In some cases, it is advisable to extract with ethyl ether before\r\nas well as after the alcoholic extraction. This treatment removes at\r\nleast a part of the water and prevents the dilution of the first part\r\nof alcohol added to such an extent as to make it dissolve some of the\r\nproteid matters. In each case, a portion of the alcoholic extract\r\nshould be tested qualitively for proteid matter. If any be found,\r\nstronger alcohol should be used for, at least, the first extraction. A\r\nportion of the meal, prepared as above directed, is extracted with a\r\nten per cent solution of sodium chlorid, as described further on, and a\r\nmeasured portion of the filtered extract diluted with water until the\r\nproteid matter in solution begins to be precipitated. By this treatment\r\nthe proper strength of the salt solution, to be used for the subsequent\r\nextraction, is determined. To save time in dialyzing, the solution of\r\nsalt employed as a solvent should be as dilute as possible.\r\n\r\nThe mixture of meal and solvent sometimes filters with difficulty.\r\nIn these cases, it is advisable to first pour it into a linen bag\r\nfrom which the liquid portion can be removed by gentle pressure and\r\nsubsequently filtered through paper. As a last resort, the liquid\r\nsecured from the linen filter can be saturated with ammonium, zinc or\r\nmagnesium sulfate, whereby all the proteid matters are thrown out.\r\nAfter filtering, the residue is again dissolved in salt solution and\r\ncan then be readily filtered through paper.\r\n\r\nThe clear filtrate should be tested by fractional precipitation by heat\r\nand the final filtrate by acetic acid, as will be described further on.\r\n\r\nThe proteid matter may be further freed from amid compounds by\r\ntreatment with copper sulfate.[365] This treatment is not advisable,\r\nhowever, except for the purpose of determining the total proteid\r\nnitrogen in the sample. The action of the water, heat and cupric\r\nsulfate combined is capable of inducing grave changes in the character\r\nof the residual matter which would seriously interfere with the results\r\nof subsequent studies of the nature of the proteid bodies.\r\n\r\nIn many instances, as with cereal grains, the separation of the proteid\r\nbodies is accomplished by no further preliminary treatment than is\r\nnecessary to reduce them to the proper degree of fineness.\r\n\r\n=393. Diversity of Character.=—The proteids which occur in vegetable\r\nproducts are found in all parts of the tissues of the plants, but in\r\ncereals especially in the seeds. In grass crops and in some of the\r\nlegumes, such as clover, the nitrogenous matters are chiefly found in\r\nthe straw and leaves. The general classification of these bodies has\r\nalready been given, but each kind of plant presents marked variations,\r\nnot only in the relative proportions of the different classes, but also\r\nin variations in the nature of each class. For this reason the study\r\nof vegetable proteids is, in some respects, a new research for each\r\nkind of plant examined. There are, however, some general principles\r\nwhich the analyst must follow in his work, and an attempt will be made\r\nhere to establish these and to construct thereon a rational method\r\nof conducting the investigation. In the separation and estimation\r\nof complex bodies so nearly related to each other, it is difficult\r\nnot only to secure satisfactory results, but also to prevent the\r\ntransformation of some forms of proteid matter into others nearly\r\nrelated thereto by the action of the solvents used for separation and\r\nprecipitation.\r\n\r\n=394. Separation of Gluten from Wheat Flour.=—The most important\r\nproteid in wheat is the body known as gluten, a commercial name given\r\nto the nitrogenous matters insoluble in cold water. The gluten thus\r\nobtained does not represent a single chemical compound, but is a\r\ncomplex consisting of at least two proteid bodies, which together form\r\nan elastic, pasty mass, insoluble in cold water containing a trace\r\nof mineral salts. This mass has the property of holding mechanically\r\nentangled among its particles bubbles of gas, which, expanding under\r\nthe action of heat during cooking, give to bread made of glutenous\r\nflours its porous property.\r\n\r\nIn respect of proteids, the American wheats, as a rule, are quite\r\nequal to those of foreign origin. This is an important characteristic\r\nwhen it is remembered that both the milling and food values of a wheat\r\ndepend largely on the nitrogenous matter which is present. It must\r\nnot be forgotten, however, that merely a high percentage of proteids\r\nis not always a sure indication of the milling value of a wheat. The\r\npercentage of gluten to the other proteid constituents of a wheat is\r\nnot always constant, and it is the gluten content of a flour on which\r\nits bread making qualities chiefly depend. The percentage of moist\r\ngluten gives, in a rough way, the property of the glutenous matter of\r\nabsorbing and holding water under conditions as nearly constant as\r\ncan be obtained. In general, it may be said that the ratio between\r\nthe moist gluten and the dry gluten in a given sample is an index for\r\ncomparison with other substances in the same sample. Upon the whole,\r\nhowever, the percentage of dry gluten must be regarded as the safer\r\nindex of quality. In respect of the content of glutenous matter, our\r\ndomestic wheats are distinctly superior to those of foreign origin.\r\nThey are even better than the Canadian wheats in this respect. It may\r\nbe fairly inferred, therefore, that while our domestic wheats give a\r\nflour slightly inferior in nutritive properties to that derived from\r\nforeign samples, it is nevertheless better adapted for baking purposes,\r\nand this quality more than compensates for its slight deficiency in\r\nrespect of nutrition, a deficiency, which, however, is so minute as to\r\nbe hardly worth considering.[366]\r\n\r\nThe gluten is separated in this laboratory from the other constituents\r\nof a flour by the following process:\r\n\r\nTen grams of the fine-ground flour are placed in a porcelain dish,\r\nwell wet with nearly an equal weight of water at a temperature of not\r\nto exceed 15°, and the mass worked into a ball with a spatula, taking\r\ncare that none of it adheres to the walls of the dish. The ball of\r\ndough is allowed to stand for an hour, at the end of which time it\r\nis held in the hand and kneaded in a stream of cold water until the\r\nstarch and soluble matter are removed. The ball of gluten thus obtained\r\nis placed in cold water and allowed to remain for an hour when it is\r\nremoved, pressed as dry as possible between the hands, rolled into a\r\nball, placed in a flat bottom dish and weighed. The weight obtained\r\nis entered as moist gluten. The dish containing the ball of gluten is\r\ndried for twenty hours in a steam-bath, again weighed, and the weight\r\nof material obtained entered as dry gluten. The determination of dry\r\nand moist gluten cannot in any sense be regarded as an isolation and\r\nestimation of a definite chemical compound. For millers’ and bakers’\r\npurposes, however, the numbers thus obtained have a high practical\r\nvalue. A typical wheat grown in this country will contain about 26.50\r\nper cent of moist and 10.25 per cent of dry gluten.\r\n\r\nThe gluten of wheat is composed of two proteid bodies, gliadin and\r\nglutenin.[367] Gliadin contains 17.66 per cent, and glutenin 17.49 per\r\ncent of nitrogen. Gliadin forms a sticky mass when mixed with water and\r\nis prevented from passing into solution by the small content of mineral\r\nsalts present in the flour. It serves to bind together the other\r\ningredients of the flour, thus rendering the dough tough and coherent.\r\nGlutenin serves to fix the gliadin and thus to make it firm and solid.\r\nGlutenin alone cannot yield gluten in the absence of gliadin, nor\r\ngliadin without the help of glutenin. Soluble metallic salts are also\r\nnecessary to the formation of gluten, and act as suggested above, by\r\npreventing the solution of the gliadin in water, during the process of\r\nwashing out the starch. No fermentation takes place in the formation of\r\ngluten from the ingredients named.\r\n\r\nThe gluten, which is obtained in an impure state by the process above\r\ndescribed, is, therefore, not to be regarded as existing as such in the\r\nwheat kernel or flour made therefrom, but to arise by a union of its\r\nelements by the action of water.\r\n\r\n=395. Extraction with Water.=—It is quite impossible to get an extract\r\nfrom fine-ground vegetable matter in pure water because the soluble\r\nsalts of the sample pass at once into solution and then a pure water\r\nsolvent becomes an extremely dilute saline solution. The aqueous\r\nextract may, however, be subjected to dialysis, whereby the saline\r\nmatter is removed and the proteid matter, not precipitated during the\r\ndialytic process, may be regarded as that part of it in the original\r\nsample soluble in pure water. Nevertheless, in many instances, it\r\nis important to obtain an extract with cold water. In oatmeal the\r\naqueous extract is obtained by Osborne as follows:[368] Five pounds of\r\nfine-ground meal are shaken occasionally with six liters of cold water\r\nfor twenty-four hours, the liquid removed by filtration and pressure\r\nand the extraction continued with another equal portion of water in\r\nthe manner noted. The two liquid extracts are united and saturated\r\nwith commercial ammonium sulfate which precipitates all the dissolved\r\nproteid matter. The filtrate obtained is collected on a filter, washed\r\nwith a saturated solution of ammonium sulfate and removed as completely\r\nas possible from the filter paper by means of a spatula. Any residual\r\nprecipitate remaining on the paper is washed into the vessel containing\r\nthe removed precipitate and the undissolved precipitate well beaten up\r\nin the liquid, which is placed in a dialyzer with a little thymol, to\r\nprevent fermentation, and subjected to dialysis for about two weeks. At\r\nthe end of that time, the contents of the dialyzer are practically free\r\nof sulfates. The contents of the dialyzers are then thrown on a filter\r\nand in the filtrate are found those proteids first extracted with\r\nwater, precipitated with ammonium sulfate and redissolved from this\r\nprecipitated state by pure water. In the case of oatmeal, this proteid\r\nmatter is not coagulated by heat, and may be obtained in the dry state\r\nby the evaporation of the filtrate last mentioned at a low temperature\r\nin vacuo. It is evident that the character of the proteid matter thus\r\nobtained will vary with the nature of the substance examined. In the\r\ncase of oats, it appears to be a proteose and not an albumin.\r\n\r\n=396. Action of Water on Composition of Proteids.=—When a body, such\r\nas oatmeal, containing many proteids of nearly related character, is\r\nexposed to the action of a large excess of water, the proteid bodies\r\nmay undergo important changes whereby their relations to solvents are\r\nchanged. After oatmeal has been extracted with water, as described\r\nabove, the proteid matter originally soluble in dilute alcohol\r\nundergoes an alteration and assumes different properties. The same\r\nremark is applicable to the proteid body soluble in dilute potash.\r\nNearly all the proteid matter of oatmeal is soluble in dilute potash,\r\nif this solvent be applied directly, but if the sample be previously\r\ntreated with water or a ten per cent salt solution the subsequent\r\nproportion of proteid matter soluble in dilute potash is greatly\r\ndiminished.[369] Water applied directly to the oatmeal apparently\r\ndissolves an acid albumin, a globulin or globulins, and a proteose. The\r\nbodies, however, soluble in water, exist only in small quantities in\r\noatmeal. Experience has shown that in most instances, it is safer to\r\nbegin the extraction of a cereal for proteid matter with a dilute salt\r\nsolution rather than with water, and to determine the matters soluble\r\nin water alone by subsequent dialysis.\r\n\r\n=397. Extraction with Dilute Salt Solution.=—In general, it is\r\nadvisable to begin the work of separating vegetable proteids by\r\nextracting the sample with a dilute brine usually of ten per cent\r\nstrength. As conducted by Osborne and Voorhees, on wheat flour, the\r\nmanipulation is carried on as follows:[370]\r\n\r\nThe fine-ground whole wheat flour, about four kilograms, is shaken with\r\ntwice that weight of a ten per cent sodium chlorid solution, strained\r\nthrough a sieve, to break up lumps, and allowed to settle for sixteen\r\nhours. At the end of this time, about half of the supernatant liquid\r\nis removed by a siphon or by decantation and filtered. Two liters\r\nmore of the salt solution are added, the mixture well stirred and the\r\nwhole brought onto the filter used above. The filtrate is collected\r\nin successive convenient portions and each portion, as soon as it is\r\nobtained, is saturated with ammonium sulfate. All the proteid matter is\r\nprecipitated by this reagent. The precipitate is collected on a filter,\r\nredissolved in a convenient quantity of the salt solution and dialyzed\r\nfor fourteen days or until all sulfates and chlorids are removed. The\r\nproteid matter, which is separated on dialysis, in this instance, is a\r\nglobulin.\r\n\r\nThe proteid matter not precipitated on dialysis is assumed to be that\r\npart of the original substance soluble in water.\r\n\r\nA part of the water soluble proteid matter obtained as above is\r\ncoagulated by heat at from 50° to 80°. The part not separated by heat\r\ngives a precipitate on saturation with sodium chlorid.\r\n\r\nIn wheat there are found soluble in water two albumins and a\r\nproteose.[371]\r\n\r\nIn separating the albumin coagulating at a low boiling point from the\r\ndialyzed solution mentioned above, it is heated to 60° for an hour,\r\nthe precipitate collected on a gooch, washed with hot water (60°), and\r\nthen successively with ninety-five per cent alcohol, water-free alcohol\r\nand ether. On drying the residual voluminous matter on the filter over\r\nsulfuric acid, it becomes dense and horny, having in an ash free state,\r\naccording to Osborne, the following composition:\r\n\r\n              Per cent.\r\n    Carbon      53.06\r\n    Hydrogen     6.82\r\n    Nitrogen    17.01\r\n    Sulfur       1.30\r\n    Oxygen      21.81\r\n\r\n=398. Treatment without Precipitation with Ammonium Sulfate.=—Where\r\nabundant means are at hand for dialyzing large volumes of solution, the\r\npreliminary treatment of the solution made with ten per cent sodium\r\nchlorid with ammonium sulfate may be omitted.\r\n\r\nWhen the precipitated proteids are to be used for the estimation of\r\nthe nitrogen therein contained, it has been proposed to substitute\r\nthe corresponding zinc salt for the ammonium sulfate.[372] This\r\nreagent has given satisfactory results in this laboratory and while a\r\nlarger experience is desirable before commending it as an acceptable\r\nsubstitute in all cases, yet its obvious advantage, in being free of\r\nnitrogen for the use mentioned, entitles it to careful consideration.\r\n\r\nThe manipulation, with the exception of the precipitation with ammonium\r\nsulfate, is the same as that described in the preceding paragraph. The\r\nglobulins are completely precipitated when the dialysis is complete and\r\nmay be separated from the soluble albumins and proteoses by filtration.\r\n\r\n=399. Separation of the Bodies Soluble in Water.=—_Albumins._—By the\r\nmethods of treatment just described, the proteid matters soluble in\r\nten per cent sodium chlorid solution are separated into two classes,\r\n_viz._, globulins insoluble in pure water and albumins and proteoses\r\nsoluble in pure water. The aqueous solution will also contain any amids\r\nor nitrogenous bases soluble in the dilute saline solution and in\r\nwater. Osborne and Voorhees have found that the best way of separating\r\nthe albumins in the pure aqueous solution is by the application of\r\nheat.[373] By means of a fractional coagulation the albumins are\r\ndivided into classes, _viz._, those separating at from 60° to 65° and\r\nthose remaining in solution at that temperature but separating up to\r\n85°. The respective quantities of these albumins are determined by\r\ncollecting them in a filter and estimating the nitrogen therein by\r\nmoist combustion in the usual way. Even a larger number of albumins may\r\nbe secured, as in the maize kernel, by such a fractional precipitation\r\nby means of heat. Chittenden and Osborne find in this instance that the\r\nprecipitation begins at about 40°.[374]\r\n\r\n_Proteose._—After the separation of the albumins by heat the filtrate\r\nmay still contain proteid matter. This matter belongs to the proteose\r\nclass. It may be partially secured by concentrating the filtrate,\r\nafter the removal of the albumins, to a small bulk when a part of\r\nthe proteose body will separate. It may be thrown out entirely by\r\ntreating the filtrate above mentioned with fine-ground salt until it is\r\nsaturated or by adding salt until the solution contains about twenty\r\nper cent thereof and precipitating the proteose by acetic acid.[375]\r\n\r\n=400. Separation of the Globulins.=—The globulins which are extracted\r\nwith ten per cent solution of sodium chlorid and precipitated on\r\ndialysis may be separated by fractional solution into several bodies of\r\nnearly related properties. This solution is conveniently accomplished\r\nby saline solvents of increasing strength. In the case of the maize\r\nglobulins, Chittenden and Osborne employ dilute solutions of common\r\nsalt for effecting the separation, beginning with a quarter of a per\r\ncent and ending with a two per cent mixture.[376]\r\n\r\n=401. Proteids Soluble in Dilute Alcohol.=—Some of the proteid bodies\r\nwhich are soluble in dilute salt solution and in water are also soluble\r\nin alcohol. Since these bodies are more easily identified by the\r\nprocesses already described, attention will be given in this paragraph\r\nsolely to those proteid bodies which are insoluble in water or dilute\r\nsalt solution and are soluble in dilute alcohol.\r\n\r\nFor the extraction of these bodies, the residue, left after extraction\r\nwith a ten per cent solution of sodium chlorid or with water, is\r\nmixed with enough strong alcohol to secure by the admixture with the\r\nwater present in the sample an alcohol of about seventy-five per cent\r\nstrength. The mixture is well shaken and digested for some time, at a\r\ntemperature of about 46°, and thrown on a filter which is kept at about\r\nthe same temperature. The residue is again mixed with alcohol of the\r\nsame strength (seventy-five per cent) using about four liters for two\r\nand a half kilos of the original material. During the second digestion\r\nthe temperature is kept at about 60°. The latter operation is repeated\r\nthree times and in each case the filtrate obtained is evaporated\r\nseparately.[377] This process is especially applicable to the meal from\r\nmaize kernels, which contains a high relative percentage of an alcohol\r\nsoluble proteid, zein.\r\n\r\nThe chief part of the zein is found in the first two extracts, obtained\r\nas described above. On evaporation, the zein separates as a tough,\r\nleathery, yellow-colored mass on the walls of the containing vessel. It\r\nis cut into small pieces and digested for several days in cold, pure\r\nalcohol. This is followed by digestion with a mixture of ether and\r\npure alcohol, and finally with pure ether. By this treatment a part of\r\nthe zein becomes insoluble in seventy-five per cent alcohol. The part\r\nsoluble in dilute alcohol is precipitated by pouring it into water.\r\n\r\nAnother method of preparing zein is to extract the meal with\r\nseventy-five per cent alcohol after it has been treated with a ten per\r\ncent salt solution.\r\n\r\nIn this case the extraction is continued with seventy-five per cent\r\nalcohol in successive portions until no more proteid matter passes\r\ninto solution. The several extracts are united and the alcohol removed\r\nby distillation, by which process the zein is separated. It is washed\r\nwith distilled water, until the sodium chlorid is removed, dissolved\r\nin warm alcohol of about eighty per cent strength and any insoluble\r\nmatter removed by filtration. On evaporating the filtrate nearly\r\nto dryness, the zein is separated and pressed as free of water as\r\npossible, yielding a yellow, elastic substance resembling molasses\r\ncandy. This preparation is purified by digestion with pure alcohol\r\nand ether in the manner described. The two zeins which are secured\r\nby the treatment, one soluble and the other insoluble in alcohol, are\r\npractically identical in composition.[378]\r\n\r\nZein freshly precipitated by pouring its alcoholic solution in water\r\nis wholly insoluble in water, and, on boiling therewith, is changed\r\ninto the variety insoluble in dilute alcohol. Boiled with dilute\r\nsulfuric acid, six in 300 cubic centimeters of water, it melts, forming\r\na gummy mass, which is very slowly attacked by the acid yielding\r\nproteoses and peptones. Heated with stronger sulfuric acid it undergoes\r\ndecomposition, yielding leucin, tyrosin, and glutamic acid.\r\n\r\n=402. Solvent Action of Acids and Alkalies.=—In the preceding\r\nparagraphs, a synopsis has been given of the methods of separating\r\nproteid matters in such a manner as to secure them in a pure state in\r\nthe same conditions as they exist in the natural substances. A very\r\nlarge percentage of the proteid matter is still left undissolved after\r\nextraction with the solvents already mentioned.\r\n\r\nOften important information may be gained concerning the nature of the\r\nresidual proteid matters by fractional extraction with dilute acids\r\nand alkalies. When the strength of these solutions is such that they\r\ncontain about one per cent of the acid or alkali, the whole of the\r\nproteid matter may be dissolved by boiling successively with acid and\r\nalkali for half an hour. The proteid matter passing into solution in\r\nthese cases is usually changed in character, assuming the nature of\r\nproteoses or allied bodies, when treated with an acid, and becoming\r\nalbuminates when boiled with an alkali. Easily soluble carbohydrate\r\nmatter is also removed by this treatment so that the residue obtained\r\nconsists largely of cellulose and is known as crude or insoluble fiber.\r\nThe removal of all the bodies soluble in dilute boiling acid and alkali\r\nis accomplished by the method described in paragraph =272=.\r\n\r\nFor research purposes, the solvent action of dilute alkali is of chief\r\nimportance to the analyst, and the extraction of the proteid matter,\r\nafter all that is soluble in water, common salt solution and alcohol\r\nhas been removed, should commence with a solution of potassium or\r\nsodium hydroxid containing not over two-tenths per cent of the alkali.\r\n\r\nIt has been shown by Osborne that the solvent action of very dilute\r\nalkali, in the cold, may be exerted without changing the character of\r\nthe dissolved proteid.[379]\r\n\r\n=403. Method of Extraction.=—The solvent employed is usually a\r\ntwo-tenths per cent solution of potassium hydroxid. It may be added\r\ndirectly to the substance or may follow extraction with water,\r\nsalt solution or alcohol. In the former case, the manipulation\r\nis illustrated by the following description of the treatment of\r\noatmeal:[380]\r\n\r\nOne hundred grams of oatmeal are mixed with half a liter of a\r\ntwo-tenths per cent potassium hydroxid solution and allowed to stand\r\nfor some time at room temperature. The mixture is strained through\r\na cloth to remove the chaff and the residue is stirred with another\r\nsmall portion of the solvent, again strained in the same cloth and the\r\nresidue squeezed dry. The strained liquids are united and enough more\r\nof the solvent added to make the volume 700 cubic centimeters. After\r\nstanding for some time, the insoluble matter settles to the bottom of\r\nthe vessel and the supernatant liquid is decanted. More solvent is\r\nadded to the residue, well mixed therewith and treated as above. It is\r\nadvisable to make a third extraction in the same way. The extracts are\r\nunited, passed through a filter, the proteid matter in solution thrown\r\nout by acetic acid, washed with water, alcohol and ether and dried over\r\nsulfuric acid.\r\n\r\nThe methods of procedure, when the sample has been previously extracted\r\nwith water, salt solution or alcohol, are essentially the same as that\r\njust described and the reader may consult the paper of Osborne for\r\ndetails.[381]\r\n\r\n=404. Methods of Drying Separated Proteids.=—In the preceding\r\nparagraphs, the analyst has been directed, in most instances, to\r\ndry the proteid matter, after it is secured in as pure a form as\r\npossible, at room temperature, over sulfuric acid. By this treatment\r\nthe preparation may be obtained in a form suited to the study of its\r\nphysical properties, since its solubility has not been affected by\r\nsubjecting it to a high temperature. When it is desired to use the\r\nsample only for chemical analysis it is not necessary to wait on the\r\nslow process above mentioned. In this case the sample may be dried in\r\nan inert atmosphere at the temperature of a steam-bath or even at 110°.\r\nIt is better, however, to avoid so high a temperature and to conduct\r\nthe desiccation in vacuo at a heat not above that of boiling water. The\r\nsample, before drying, should be reduced to the finest possible state\r\nof comminution, otherwise particles of aqueous vapor may be retained\r\nwith great tenacity.\r\n\r\nIn many cases it is advisable to dry the sample pretty thoroughly, then\r\ngrind to a fine powder and finish the desiccation with the pulverulent\r\nmass. This treatment can be followed when the quantity of the material\r\nis considerably in excess of that required for the analytical\r\noperations.\r\n\r\n=405. Determination of Ash.=—No method of treatment is known by means\r\nof which vegetable proteid matters may be obtained entirely free\r\nof mineral matters. The mineral bases may be naturally present in\r\nthe proteid matter as organic and inorganic salts, or they may be\r\nmechanically entangled therewith, having been derived either from\r\nthe other tissues of the plant or from the solvents employed. It is\r\nnecessary in calculating the analytical data to base the computation on\r\nthe ash free substance. The percentage of ash is determined by any of\r\nthe standard processes or by heating the sample in a combustion tube,\r\nto very low redness, in a current of oxygen. The total residue obtained\r\nis used in calculating the percentage of ash, and the weights of\r\nmaterial subsequently used for the determination of carbon, hydrogen,\r\nnitrogen and sulfur are corrected for the calculations by deducting the\r\nquantity of mineral matter contained therein.\r\n\r\nBy reason of the highly hygroscopic nature of the dry proteid bodies,\r\nthey must be kept over a desiccating material and weighed quickly on a\r\nbalance, in an atmosphere which is kept free of moisture by the usual\r\nmethods.\r\n\r\n=406. Carbon and Hydrogen.=—Carbon and hydrogen are estimated in\r\nproteid matters by combustion with copper oxid. Osborne prefers to burn\r\nthe sample in a platinum boat in a current of air or of oxygen free of\r\nmoisture and carbon dioxid.[382] It is advisable to use also a layer of\r\nlead chromate in addition to the copper oxid and metallic copper. The\r\nmethod of conducting the combustion has already been described.[383] The\r\nanalyst should have at his disposal a quantity of pure sugar, which\r\nmay be used from time to time in testing the accuracy of the work.\r\nIn beginning a series of combustions this precaution should never be\r\nomitted. The addition of the lead chromate is to make more certain the\r\nabsorption of oxidized sulfur produced during the combustion.\r\n\r\n=407. Estimation of Nitrogen.=—In most cases it is found convenient,\r\nduring the progress of separating vegetable proteids, to determine the\r\nquantity of each kind by estimating the nitrogen by moist combustion\r\nand computing the quantity of proteid matter by multiplying the\r\nnitrogen by 6.25. The estimation of the nitrogen is made either on an\r\naliquot part of the extract or by direct treatment of the residue.\r\n\r\nIn the pure extracted proteid matter the nitrogen is most conveniently\r\ndetermined by moist combustion, but it may also be obtained either by\r\ncombustion with soda-lime or with copper oxid, or by other reliable\r\nmethods.[384]\r\n\r\nThe percentages of nitrogen found in the principal proteid bodies,\r\ntogether with the factors for computing the weights of the proteid\r\nbodies from the weights of nitrogen found, are given below:\r\n\r\n      Name of body.    Percentage of nitrogen.

Determination of Sulfur.=—Sulfur is a characteristic constituent\r\nof the proteid bodies, existing in quantities approximating one per\r\ncent of their weight.\r\n\r\nIn the estimation of sulfur, it is first converted into sulfuric acid,\r\nwhich is thrown out by a soluble barium salt and the sulfur finally\r\nweighed as barium sulfate.\r\n\r\nAll the sulfur existing in the organic state in a proteid may be\r\nobtained by burning in a current of oxygen and conducting the gaseous\r\nproducts of combustion through solid sodium or potassium carbonate\r\nat or near a red heat.[385] The organic sulfur may also be converted\r\ninto sulfuric acid by fusing the proteid body with a mixture of\r\nsodium hydroxid and potassium nitrate. The fused mass, after cooling,\r\nis dissolved in water, the solution acidified with hydrochloric,\r\nevaporated to dryness to decompose nitrates and remove excess of\r\nhydrochloric acid and dissolved in a large excess of water. After\r\nstanding for a day, the solution is filtered and the sulfuric acid\r\nthrown out of the hot filtrate with a slight excess of barium chlorid\r\nsolution. The usual precautions in precipitating, filtering and\r\nigniting the barium sulfate are to be observed.[386]\r\n\r\n=409. General Observations.=—In the preceding paragraphs have been\r\nstated the general principles upon which the separation of vegetable\r\nproteid matters depends, and a description has been given of the\r\nseveral processes by which this separation is accomplished. In\r\neach case, however, special conditions exist which require special\r\nmodifications of the general processes, and these can only be\r\nsuccessfully secured by the skill, judgment and patient labor of the\r\ninvestigator. Many of these cases have been already worked out, and the\r\nvaluable data secured by Chittenden, Osborne and others, are accessible\r\nto the analyst in the papers already cited. In the case of the proteids\r\nin the peanut, a similar work has been done in this laboratory by\r\nBigelow, the data of which have not yet been published. It is only\r\nby a careful study of the work already done as outlined here and as\r\npublished in full in the cited papers, that the analyst will be able to\r\nsecure trustworthy guidance for future investigations.\r\n\r\n=410. Dialysis.=—One of the most important of the operations connected\r\nwith the separation and analysis of proteids is the removal of the\r\nsalts whereby their solutions are secured. This is accomplished by\r\nsubjecting the solutions of the proteid matters to dialysis. The\r\nsolution is placed in bags made of parchment dialysis paper. These\r\nbags are tied about a glass tube, whereby access may be had to their\r\ncontents during the progress of the work. Since the volume of the\r\nliquid increases during the process, the bags should not be filled too\r\nfull in the beginning.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 105. DIALYZING APPARATUS.]\r\n\r\nIn this laboratory the dialysis is carried out by Bigelow with the\r\ncity water from the Potomac, which is first passed through a battery\r\nof porous porcelain filtering tubes to remove any suspended silt or\r\nmicro-organisms. If unfiltered water be used, the germs therein cause\r\na fermentation in the proteid matter, which seriously interferes with\r\nthe value of the data obtained, and which can only be avoided by the\r\nuse of an antiseptic, such as an alcoholic solution of thymol. Even\r\nwith filtered water, the use of a few drops of the solution mentioned\r\nis often necessary. To avoid the use of too great quantities of the\r\nfiltered water, the dialyzers are arranged _en batterie_, as shown in\r\nthe figure. The filtered water enters the first vessel and thence\r\npasses through all. The parchment bags are frequently changed from\r\nvessel to vessel, each being brought successively into the first vessel\r\nin contact with the fresh water. In some cases the final steps in the\r\ndialysis may be accomplished in distilled water.\r\n\r\nIt is advisable to conduct a fractional preliminary dialysis of the\r\nsalt solution containing proteids in such a way as to secure the\r\nglobulins precipitated in each interval of twenty-four hours. Each\r\nportion thus secured may be examined with the microscope. Usually a\r\nperiod of two weeks is required to entirely remove the mineral salts\r\nfrom solution. If prepared parchment tubes be used for the dialysis,\r\nthey should be first tested for leaks, and should not be more than half\r\nfilled. By the use of a large number of these tubes a greater surface\r\nis exposed to dialytic action, and the time required to complete the\r\noperation is correspondingly decreased.\r\n\r\n\r\nSEPARATION AND ESTIMATION OF NITROGENOUS BODIES IN ANIMAL PRODUCTS.\r\n\r\n=411. Preparation of the Sample.=—Animal products present many\r\ndifficulties in respect of the reduction thereof to a sufficiently\r\ncomminuted condition for analytical examination. In the case of bones,\r\nthe choppers used for preparing them for feeding to fowls are the most\r\nefficient apparatus for reducing them to fragments. In this condition\r\nthey may be ground to a finer state in a sausage machine. The flesh of\r\nanimals may be reduced by this machine, with two or three grindings,\r\nto a fairly homogeneous mass. Subsequent grinding in a mortar with\r\npowdered glass or sharp sand may serve to reduce the sample to a finer\r\npulp, but is not usually necessary and should be avoided when possible.\r\nThe sample thus prepared serves for the estimation of water, ash\r\nand fat by methods already described. The sample should be prepared\r\nin quantities of considerable magnitude, the whole of any organ or\r\nseparate portion of the body being used when possible. In examining the\r\nwhole body the relative weights of blood, bones, viscera, muscle, hide\r\nand other parts should first of all be ascertained and noted.\r\n\r\n=412. Treatment of Muscular Tissues for Nitrogenous Bodies.=—For\r\nthe present purpose a brief sketch of the method of separating the\r\nnitrogenous bodies in the muscular tissues of the body is all that\r\ncan be attempted. For methods of examining the different organs and\r\nparts of the body in greater detail, standard works on physiological\r\nchemistry may be consulted.[387]\r\n\r\n_Extraction with Cold Water._—A noted quantity of the finely divided\r\ntissues is mixed with several volumes of ice-cold water and well rubbed\r\noccasionally for several hours, the temperature meanwhile being kept\r\nlow. The mixture is poured into a linen bag and the liquid portion\r\nremoved by gentle pressure. The residue in like manner is treated with\r\nfresh portions of cold water until it gives up no further soluble\r\nmatters. An aliquot portion of the extract is concentrated to a small\r\nbulk and serves for the determination of total nitrogen. The methods of\r\nseparating and estimating nitrogenous bodies in flesh soluble in water\r\nwill be given in considerable detail further on.\r\n\r\n_Extraction with Ammonium Chlorid and Hydrochloric Acid._—The residue,\r\nafter exhaustion with cold water, is extracted with a solution of\r\nammonium chlorid containing 150 grams of the salt in a liter. This\r\nmethod of extraction is entirely similar to that with water just\r\ndescribed. Globulins and myosin pass into solution by this treatment.\r\nThe residual mass is washed as free as possible of the solvent and\r\nis then further extracted with dilute hydrochloric acid containing\r\nfour cubic centimeters of the fuming acid in a liter. The treatment\r\nwith dilute acid is continued until no further substance passes\r\ninto solution. This is determined by neutralizing a portion of the\r\nextract with sodium carbonate, or by the direct addition of potassium\r\nferrocyanid. In either case absence of a precipitate indicates that no\r\nnitrogenous matters are present in the solution.\r\n\r\n_Extraction with Alkali._—The residue from the acid extraction is\r\nwashed with water until the acid is removed and then extracted in a\r\nsimilar manner with a dilute solution of sodium or potassium hydroxid\r\ncontaining not to exceed two grams of the caustic to the liter. When\r\nthis residue is finally washed with water and a little acetic acid,\r\nit will be found that practically all the purely albuminous bodies\r\ncontained in the tissues have been extracted with the exception of any\r\nfibrin, which the blood, present in the tissues at the commencement of\r\nthe extraction, may have contained. The extract should be acidified\r\nwith acetic as soon as obtained.\r\n\r\n_Extraction with Boiling Water._—The residual matter boiled for some\r\ntime with water will part with its collagen, which, when transformed by\r\nthe heat into glutin, passes into solution.\r\n\r\nThe sarcolemma, membranes, elastic fibers and keratin remain\r\nundissolved.\r\n\r\n=413. Contents of the Several Extracts.=—By the systematic treatment of\r\nmuscular tissues in the manner just described, the nitrogenous bodies\r\nthey contain are separated into five classes, _viz._:\r\n\r\n_Cold Water Extract._—This contains serum albumin, serum globulin,\r\nmuscle albumin, myosin, mucin and peptone.\r\n\r\n_Ammonium Chlorid Extract._—This solution contains the globulins and\r\nalso in many cases some myosin and serum globulin.\r\n\r\n_Hydrochloric Acid Extract._—When the extractive matter removed by\r\nhydrochloric acid, thrown out by sodium carbonate and well washed with\r\nwater, has a neutral reaction, it consists of syntonin, when acid, of\r\nan albuminate.\r\n\r\n_Alkali Extract._—The acid albumin of the animal tissue is found in the\r\nalkaline solution and may be thrown out by making the solution slightly\r\nacid.\r\n\r\n_Insoluble Residue._—The fifth class contains the insoluble nitrogenous\r\nbodies mentioned above.\r\n\r\n=414. General Observations.=—Only a brief résumé of the methods of\r\ntreating animal tissues for nitrogenous bases is given above, since\r\na more elaborate discussion of these principles and methods would\r\nlead too far away from the main purpose of this manual. For practical\r\npurposes, the most important of these bodies are those soluble in water\r\nand the methods of treating these will be handled at some length.\r\nUnfortunately, the methods of determining the exact qualities of these\r\nbodies are not as satisfactory in case of animal as in vegetable\r\nnitrogenous bodies. The flesh bases, soluble in water, contain a much\r\nlarger percentage of nitrogen than is found in true proteid bodies,\r\nand therefore the multiplication of the weight of nitrogen found\r\ntherein by 6.25 does not give even a near approximation of the actual\r\nquantities of the nitrogenous bodies present in the sample.\r\n\r\nSome of the flesh bases contain more than twice as much nitrogen as\r\nis found in proteids, and in such cases 3.12, and not 6.25, would be\r\nthe more correct factor to use in the computation. When possible,\r\ntherefore, these bodies should be precipitated and weighed after\r\ndrying, but this is not practicable in many instances. The sole\r\nresource of the chemist in such cases is to determine the nature of the\r\nbody as nearly as possible by qualitive reactions, then to determine\r\nthe total nitrogen therein and multiply its weight by the corresponding\r\nfactor. The principal flesh bases have the following percentages of\r\nnitrogen and the approximate factors for calculating analytical data\r\nare also given:\r\n\r\n    Name of base.    Formula.

Composition of Meat Extracts.=—The meat extracts of commerce\r\ncontain all the constituents of meat that are soluble in warm water.\r\nThe parts which are soluble in warm water and not in cold are found\r\nin the cold aqueous solution as suspended or sedimentary matters.\r\nAmong the nitrogenous bodies present are included albumin, albumose\r\nand peptone among the proteids, carnin, kreatin, kreatinin, sarkin and\r\nxanthin among the non-proteids, and inosinic and uric acids and urea\r\namong other nitrogenous bodies. Among the non-nitrogenous bodies are\r\nfound lactic and butyric acids, inosit and glycogen. Among mineral\r\nbodies occurs the phosphates and chlorids of the common bases. In\r\naddition to these bodies, meat extracts may also contain gelatin and\r\nother decomposition products of proteid matter. Since meat extract is\r\nsupposed to be prepared by the digestion of the meat free of bones\r\nand put in cold water or in warm water not above 75°, the presence\r\nof gelatin would indicate a different method of preparation, _viz._,\r\neither by boiling water or water heated above the boiling point under\r\npressure. In a properly prepared extract, the percentage of gelatin is\r\nvery small.\r\n\r\nApproximately one-tenth of the whole nitrogen present is in the form\r\nof albumoses and only a trace as peptones. By far the greater part of\r\nthe nitrogen exists as flesh bases (kreatin, etc.). The composition of\r\nthree meat extracts, numbers one and two solid and number three liquid,\r\nis given in the subjoined table.[388]\r\n\r\n                                           No. 1.

Analysis of Meat Extracts.=—The analysis of a meat extract\r\nshould include the determination of the water, ash and total nitrogen.\r\nAfter multiplying the nitrogen which exists as proteids by 6.25 and\r\nadding together the percentages of all the ingredients, ash, water,\r\netc., including ammonia, the sum is to be subtracted from 100 and the\r\ndifference entered as non-nitrogenous organic matter. The nature of\r\nthis conglomerate has already been explained.\r\n\r\n_Water._—It is advisable to determine the water in a partial vacuum\r\n(=20=) or in an atmosphere of hydrogen (=23-25=).\r\n\r\nThe water may also be determined in solid extracts by placing about\r\nfive grams of the material in a flat bottom tin foil dish about\r\nfifty-five millimeters in diameter and twenty millimeters deep. The\r\nmaterial is dissolved in enough warm water to fill the dish a little\r\nover one-half and the liquid is then absorbed by adding a weighed\r\nquantity of fibrous asbestos or of dry fragments of pumice stone.\r\nThe asbestos is to be preferred because of the fact that it may be\r\nsubsequently cut into small bits for the determination of the gelatin.\r\nThe dish thus prepared is dried to constant weight in a steam-bath\r\nor vacuum oven. The weight of the dish and of the added absorbent,\r\ntogether with that of the material employed and of the dried dish and\r\nits contents, give the data for calculating the percentage of water.\r\nThe contents of the dish are used as described further on for the\r\ndetermination of gelatin. In liquid extracts the water is determined in\r\nan entirely analogous manner, using about twenty grams of the material\r\nand omitting the solution in water.\r\n\r\nIn solid extracts, the part insoluble in cold water is determined\r\nseparately.\r\n\r\n_Ash._—The ash is determined by ignition at the lowest possible\r\ntemperature, best in a muffle (=28-32=). The ash should be examined\r\nqualitively. Where a quantitive analysis is desired, larger quantities\r\nof the extract are incinerated and the constituents of the ash\r\ndetermined in the usual way.[389]\r\n\r\n_Total Nitrogen._—Since nitrates are not present unless added in\r\nthe manufacture, the total nitrogen is best determined by moist\r\ncombustion.[390]\r\n\r\n_Nitric Nitrogen._—The extract should be tested for nitrates and if\r\npresent they are determined in the manner already described.[391]\r\n\r\n_Ammoniacal Nitrogen._—When ammonia is present it is determined by\r\ndistillation with magnesia.[392]\r\n\r\nSince boiling with magnesia may cause the distillation of more\r\nammonia than is present as ammonium salts, the plus being due to the\r\ndecomposition of some other nitrogenous compounds, Stutzer replaces the\r\nmagnesia with barium carbonate.[393]\r\n\r\n_Proteid Nitrogen Insoluble in Sixty-Two Per Cent Alcohol._—The aqueous\r\nsolution is treated with strong alcohol until the mixture contains\r\nabout sixty-two per cent of the reagent. The precipitate produced is\r\nseparated by filtration, washed with sixty-two per cent alcohol and the\r\nnitrogen therein determined.\r\n\r\n_Albumose Nitrogen._—This is secured by saturating the aqueous solution\r\nwith zinc or ammonium sulfate. The separated albumoses are skimmed from\r\nthe surface, thrown in a filter, washed with a saturated solution of\r\nzinc sulfate and the nitrogen determined therein by moist combustion.\r\nIn the filtrate from the above separation, peptone is detected\r\nqualitively by adding a few drops of dilute solution of copper sulfate\r\n(biuret reaction).\r\n\r\n_Kreatin, Kreatinin and Other Flesh Bases._—The clear, aqueous solution\r\nof the extract is acidified with sulfuric, mixed with a solution of\r\nsodium phosphotungstate and allowed to stand for about six days. The\r\nprecipitate is collected, washed with a solution of the precipitant,\r\nand the nitrogen therein determined. The nitrogen found, less that due\r\nto ammonia, represents the total nitrogenous matter precipitated by\r\nthe phosphotungstic acid. From this quantity is deducted the nitrogen\r\nin the proteids, precipitated by sixty-two per cent alcohol and by\r\nammonium or zinc sulfate, and the remainder represents the nitrogen in\r\nflesh bases.\r\n\r\nThe nitrogen thrown out by the phosphotungstic acid is deducted from\r\nthe total nitrogen, and the remainder represents the nitrogenous bodies\r\nnot precipitable by the reagent named.\r\n\r\nThis method of separating the nitrogenous matters in meat extracts is\r\nbased on the observation that these bodies contain at most only a small\r\nquantity of peptones, so small as to be safely negligible.[394]\r\n\r\n_Quantities used for Analysis._—In conducting the separations above\r\nnoted, it will be found convenient to use in each case about five\r\ngrams of the solid or twenty of the liquid extract. In the nitrogen\r\ndeterminations, the weight of the sample should be inversely\r\nproportional to its content of nitrogen.\r\n\r\n=417. Preparation of the Phosphotungstic Reagent.=—The phosphotungstic\r\nreagent is conveniently prepared as follows:\r\n\r\nDissolve 120 grams of sodium phosphate and 200 of sodium tungstate in\r\none liter of water and add to the solution 100 cubic centimeters of\r\nstrong sulfuric acid. When the reagent is prepared for general purposes\r\nit is customary to acidify with nitric, but in the present instance,\r\ninasmuch as the precipitate is used for the determination of nitrogen,\r\nit is evident that sulfuric should be substituted for nitric acid.\r\nIn all cases the analyst must be assured of the strong acidity of\r\nthe reagent, and in addition to this the solutions of proteid matter\r\nto which the reagent is added must first be made strongly acid with\r\nsulfuric.\r\n\r\n=418. Zinc Sulfate as Reagent for Separating Albumoses from\r\nPeptones.=—When the albumoses are separated from the peptones, by\r\nprecipitation with ammonium sulfate, there may be danger of some of\r\nthis reagent adhering to the albumose, and in this way the quantity of\r\nnitrogen obtained on analysis may be increased. To avoid an accident of\r\nthis kind Bömer replaces the ammonium by zinc sulfate.[395]\r\n\r\nSince the precipitation of the albumoses by saturated saline solutions\r\ndepends on their hydrolytic power, the substitution of another salt\r\nfor ammonium sulfate capable of strongly attracting water, may be made\r\nif that salt does not possess any objectionable property. Crystallized\r\nzinc sulfate will dissolve in less than its own weight of cold water\r\nand is therefore well suited for the purpose in view.\r\n\r\nIn the case of a meat extract, the precipitation is accomplished as\r\nfollows: Fifty cubic centimeters of the extract, freed from all solid\r\nmatter by filtration and containing about two grams of the soluble\r\nproteids, are saturated in the cold with finely powdered zinc sulfate.\r\nThe separated albumoses collect on the surface and are skimmed off,\r\npoured on a filter and washed with cold saturated zinc sulfate\r\nsolution. The filter and its contents are used for the determination of\r\nnitrogen by moist combustion.[396]\r\n\r\nThe filtrate from the precipitated albumoses gives no biuret reaction,\r\nand, therefore, as in the use of ammonium sulfate, is free of albumin.\r\n\r\nThe biuret reaction is applied to the zinc sulfate filtrate as follows:\r\nThe filtrate is greatly diluted with water and freed of zinc by means\r\nof a saturated solution of sodium carbonate. The filtrate free of zinc\r\nis evaporated on the steam-bath, made strongly alkaline with sodium\r\nhydroxid and treated with a few drops of a two per cent copper sulfate\r\nsolution, added successively.\r\n\r\nAnother advantage possessed by the zinc sulfate is found in the fact\r\nthat in the filtrate from the separated albumoses the peptones and\r\nother flesh bases can be thrown out by phosphotungstic acid. Before the\r\napplication of the reagent, the filtrate should be made strongly acid\r\nby adding about an equal volume of dilute sulfuric acid (one part of\r\nacid to four of water.)\r\n\r\nThe nitrogen in the precipitate thus obtained is determined by moist\r\ncombustion in the manner already suggested.\r\n\r\nIf the proteid matters contain salts of ammonium it is probable\r\nthat a difficultly soluble double sulfate of zinc and ammonium,\r\n(NH₄)₂SO₄.ZnSO₄.6H₂O, will be found in the precipitate. Ammonium salts,\r\nif present, should therefore be removed by distillation with magnesia.\r\nIt is better, however, to throw down the ammonia with the first zinc\r\nprecipitate, distil this with magnesia and determine the amount of\r\nnitrogen derived from the ammonia compounds. In a second sample, the\r\ntotal nitrogen is determined by moist combustion and the difference\r\nbetween the two results gives that due to albumoses.\r\n\r\n=419. Examination for Muscular Tissue.=—Some samples of meat extracts\r\ncontain small quantities of finely ground muscular tissue. For\r\ndetecting this the extract is treated with cold water and the insoluble\r\nresidue examined with a microscope. If muscular tissue be found, about\r\neight grams of the extract or twenty-five of the fluid preparation, are\r\ntreated with cold water, the insoluble matter collected upon a filter,\r\nwashed with cold water, and the nitrogen determined in the residue. The\r\npercentage of nitrogen multiplied by 6.25 gives the quantity of muscle\r\nfiber proteids present. The filtrate from the above determination\r\nis acidified with acetic, boiled, any precipitate which is formed\r\ncollected and the nitrogen therein determined. The nitrogen obtained\r\nmultiplied by 6.25 gives the quantity of coagulable albumin present.\r\nAn aliquot portion of the filtrate is used for the determination of\r\nnitrogen and the percentage therein found, deducted from the total\r\nnitrogen of the sample, gives a remainder which may be used as a\r\nrepresentative of the whole of the nitrogen present in the form of\r\nalbumin and muscular tissue.\r\n\r\n=420. Estimation of Gelatin.=—The tin foil dish and its contents\r\nused for the determination of water, as above described, are cut\r\ninto small pieces, placed in a beaker and extracted four times with\r\nabsolute alcohol. After the removal of the alcohol, the residue is\r\nextracted with ice water containing ten per cent of alcohol, in\r\nwhich a small piece of ice is kept to avoid a rise of temperature.\r\nThe beaker should be shaken during the extraction, which should last\r\nfor about two minutes. Where large numbers of samples are treated\r\nat once, any convenient form of shaking machine may be employed. At\r\nleast two extractions with ice water must be made. The residue is then\r\ncollected upon a filter and washed with ice water until the washings\r\nare completely colorless. The residue on the filter is replaced in\r\nthe beaker, boiled with water, well washed on the filter with boiling\r\nwater, the filtrate and washings concentrated and the nitrogen therein\r\ndetermined.\r\n\r\nThe principle of this determination is based on the fact that gelatin\r\nis almost completely insoluble in ice water while serum peptones and\r\nalbumin peptones are almost completely soluble in that reagent. On\r\nthe other hand, the flesh bases and the proteids present are almost\r\ncompletely removed by the preliminary treatment with alcohol and ice\r\nwater or are left undissolved by the hot water. The solution in boiling\r\nwater, therefore, contains practically nothing but gelatin.[397]\r\n\r\nIn a later article, Stutzer modifies the method given above as\r\nfollows:[398]\r\n\r\nOf dry and moist extracts from five to seven grams and of liquid\r\nextracts from twenty to twenty-five grams are used for the\r\ndetermination and placed in tin foil dishes, as described above. In\r\ncase of solid extracts, a sufficient quantity of warm water is added to\r\ncompletely dissolve them, the solution being facilitated by stirring.\r\nIn case the solution is too thin it should be concentrated before going\r\nfurther. It is treated with a sufficient amount of dust-free ignited\r\nsand to completely absorb it, and the dish and its contents are then\r\ndried to a constant weight. The dried contents of the dish are rubbed\r\nup in a mortar, the dish cut into fine bits, and all placed in a\r\nbeaker. The solid syrphete[399] is extracted four times with 100 cubic\r\ncentimeters of absolute alcohol, the alcohol in each case being poured\r\nthrough an asbestos filter for the purpose of collecting any matters\r\nsuspended therein. In a large flask are placed 100 grams of alcohol,\r\n300 grams of ice and 600 grams of cold water, and the flask is placed\r\nin a large vessel and packed with finely divided ice. Four beakers\r\nmarked _b, c, d, e_ are also placed in ice and the beaker containing\r\nthe syrphete, left after extraction with absolute alcohol as above\r\nmentioned, is marked _a_ and also placed in pounded ice. The extraction\r\nwith cold alcoholic water proceeds as follows:\r\n\r\nIn beaker _a_ are poured 100 cubic centimeters of the mixture in the\r\nlarge flask, its contents are stirred for two minutes and then the\r\nliquid portion poured off into beaker _b_ to which, at the same time,\r\na piece of ice is added. In beaker _a_ are poured again 100 cubic\r\ncentimeters from the large flask, treated as above described, and the\r\nliquid extract poured into beaker _c_. In like manner the extraction\r\nin beaker _a_ is continued until each of the beakers has received\r\nits portion of the extract. By this time the liquid over the sand in\r\nbeaker _a_ should be completely colorless. The filtration of the liquid\r\nextract is accomplished as follows:\r\n\r\nIn a funnel of about seven centimeters diameter is placed a perforated\r\nporcelain plate about four centimeters in diameter which is covered\r\nwith asbestos felt with long fiber. Three filters are prepared in this\r\nway. On the first filter are poured the contents of beaker _b_. After\r\nthe liquid has passed through, the sand and other residue in beaker _a_\r\nare transferred to the filter and the beaker and residue washed with\r\nthe alcoholic ice water from the large flask. The filtration should\r\nbe accomplished under pressure. On the second filter are poured the\r\ncontents of beaker _c_. On the third filter the contents of beakers\r\n_d_ and _e_. The washing with alcoholic ice water from the large flask\r\nis continued in each instance until the filtrate is colorless. At the\r\nsame time the asbestos filter, which was used in the first instance for\r\nfiltering the absolute alcohol extract, is washed with the alcoholic\r\nice water mixture from the large flask. At the end the sand remaining\r\nin beaker a together with all the asbestos filters are brought\r\ntogether into a porcelain dish, boiled two or three times with water,\r\nthe aqueous solution filtered and the filtrate concentrated and used\r\nfor the estimation of the nitrogen. The quantity of nitrogen found\r\nmultiplied by 6.25 represents the proteid matter in the gelatin of the\r\nsample.\r\n\r\nThe object of the multiple filters, described above, is to accelerate\r\nthe process, and they are required because the gelatin quickly occludes\r\nthe filter pores. For this reason the asbestos filters are found\r\nto operate better than those made of paper. It should be mentioned\r\nthat the residue of the peptones insoluble in alcohol may contain,\r\nin addition to gelatin, also small quantities of albumoses. From the\r\nquantity of albumose nitrogen found, it is understood that the nitrogen\r\nin the form of coagulable albumin, determined as described in the first\r\nprocess mentioned above, is to be deducted, since these coagulable\r\nalbumins are insoluble in alcohol.\r\n\r\n=421. Estimation of Nitrogen in the Flesh Bases Soluble in\r\nAlcohol.=—About five grams of the dry extract, ten grams of the\r\nextract containing water or twenty-five grams of the liquid extract\r\nare placed in a beaker and enough water added in each case to make\r\nabout twenty-five cubic centimeters in all. Usually no water need be\r\nadded to the liquid extracts. Very thin peptone solutions should be\r\nevaporated until the content of water is reduced to seventy-five per\r\ncent. The solution, prepared as above indicated, is treated slowly\r\nwith constant stirring with 250 cubic centimeters of absolute alcohol,\r\nthe stirring continued for some minutes and the vessel set aside for\r\ntwelve hours, at the end of which time the precipitate is separated by\r\nfiltration and washed repeatedly with strong alcohol. Leucin, tyrosin\r\nand a part of the flesh bases are dissolved by alcohol. The alcohol is\r\nremoved by distillation and the residue dissolved in water. Any flocky\r\nresidue which remains on solution with water is removed by filtration,\r\nthe nitrogen determined therein and the quantity thereof added to the\r\nalbumose nitrogen found, as hereafter described.\r\n\r\nThe volume of the aqueous solution is completed with water to half a\r\nliter. One hundred cubic centimeters of this solution are used for the\r\ndetermination of total nitrogen, and another 100 cubic centimeters\r\nfor the determination of ammoniacal nitrogen by distillation with\r\nbarium carbonate. A part of the ammonia may have escaped during the\r\npreliminary distillation of the alcohol and therefore the amount found\r\nmay not represent the whole amount originally present. The use of the\r\nabove determination is principally to ascertain the correction to be\r\nmade in the amount of total nitrogen found in the first 100 cubic\r\ncentimeters of the solution.\r\n\r\n=422. Treatment of the Residue Insoluble in Alcohol.=—The residue\r\ninsoluble in alcohol is washed from the filter into the beaker in\r\nwhich the first solution was made. The aqueous mixture is warmed\r\non a water-bath until the alcohol adhering to the precipitate is\r\ncompletely evaporated, when the contents of the beaker are poured upon\r\na filter free of nitrogen. A small part of the albumose, by reason of\r\nthe treatment with alcohol, tends to remain undissolved, and it is\r\nadvisable to collect this albumose upon a filter, wash it well with hot\r\nwater and estimate the nitrogen therein. The quantity of nitrogen thus\r\nfound is to be added to the albumose nitrogen determined as described\r\nlater on.\r\n\r\nThe total filtrate obtained from the last filtration is made up to\r\na volume of half a liter, of which fifty cubic centimeters are used\r\nfor the determination of total nitrogen, fifty cubic centimeters for\r\nthe determination of gelatin, albumose and peptone, and 100 cubic\r\ncentimeters for the residual peptones. The albumose, together with the\r\ngelatin and peptones carried down with it, is precipitated with zinc or\r\nammonium sulfate solution, and its per cent calculated from the amount\r\nof nitrogen found in the precipitate. The true peptone is determined by\r\nsubtracting the quantity of nitrogen determined as albumose from the\r\ntotal nitrogen in solution.\r\n\r\nThe rest of the liquid, _viz._, 300 cubic centimeters, is evaporated to\r\na small volume and tested qualitively for true peptones as follows:\r\n\r\nTo separate the albumose and gelatin a concentrated liquor is treated\r\nwith an excess of finely divided ammonium sulfate so that a part of\r\nthe salt remains undissolved. The separated albumose, gelatin and\r\nundissolved ammonium salts are collected on a filter, the filtrate\r\nmixed with a few drops of dilute copper sulfate solution and a\r\nconsiderable quantity of concentrated soda or potash lye added. Care\r\nshould be taken that the quantity of copper is not too great, otherwise\r\nthe peculiar red coloration will be obscured by the blue color of the\r\ncopper solution.\r\n\r\n=423. Pancreas Peptone.=—The filtrate obtained as described above, by\r\ntreating the portion of the material insoluble in alcohol with warm\r\nwater, contains in addition to the albumose and gelatin the whole of\r\nthe pancreas peptone which may be present. To separate this peptone,\r\n100 cubic centimeters of the aqueous solution are evaporated in a\r\nporcelain dish until the volume does not exceed ten cubic centimeters.\r\nWhen cool, at least 100 cubic centimeters of a saturated cooled\r\nsolution of ammonium sulfate solution are added, the mixture thoroughly\r\nstirred, the precipitate collected upon a filter and washed with a cold\r\nsaturated solution of ammonium sulfate. The contents of the filter\r\nare dissolved in boiling water, the filter thoroughly washed and the\r\nfiltrate and washings evaporated in a porcelain dish with the addition\r\nof barium carbonate until, on the addition of new quantities of barium\r\ncarbonate, no further trace of ammonia can be discovered. The residue\r\nis extracted with water, the barium sulfate and carbonate present\r\nseparated by filtration, well washed and the nitrogen determined in the\r\nevaporated filtrate and washings in the usual way and multiplied by\r\n6.25 to determine the quantity of pancreas peptone.\r\n\r\n=424. Albumose Peptone.=—A part of the albumose peptone which may be\r\npresent is determined in conjunction with the other bodies mentioned\r\nabove. The chief quantity is found in the solution of the residue\r\ninsoluble in alcohol in the following manner:\r\n\r\nFifty cubic centimeters of the solution of this residue in hot water\r\nare mixed with an equal volume of dilute sulfuric acid, one volume\r\nof acid to three of water, in the cold, and a solution of sodium\r\nphosphotungstate added until it produces no further precipitate. The\r\nprecipitate is washed with dilute sulfuric acid and the nitrogen\r\ndetermined therein. The nitrogen thus found is derived from the\r\nalbumose, pancreas peptone and gelatin. The quantity of nitrogen in the\r\npancreas peptone and gelatin, as above described, is subtracted from\r\nthe total quantity found in the phosphotungstic acid precipitated, and\r\nthe remainder represents the nitrogen due to the albumose.\r\n\r\n=425. Nitrogen in the Form of Flesh Bases Insoluble in Alcohol.=—This\r\nis determined by subtracting the quantity of nitrogen, determined by\r\nthe phosphotungstic acid method already described, from the total\r\nquantity of nitrogen found in the precipitate insoluble in alcohol and\r\nsoluble in water.\r\n\r\n\r\nAUTHORITIES CITED IN PART FIFTH.\r\n\r\n[337] Watts’ Dictionary of Chemistry, new edition, Vol. 4, p. 327.\r\n\r\n[338] Vid. op. cit. supra, p. 330.\r\n\r\n[339] Barbieri, Journal für praktische Chemie, neue Folge Band 18, S.\r\n114.\r\n\r\n[340] Vid. op. cit. 1, p. 339.\r\n\r\n[341] Bulletin No. 49, Kansas Experiment Station, May, 1895.\r\n\r\n[342] This work, Vol. 2, p. 208.\r\n\r\n[343] Vid. op. cit. supra, Vol. 1, p. 570.\r\n\r\n[344] Wiley, American Chemical Journal, Vol. 6, No. 5, p. 289.\r\n\r\n[345] Obermayer, Chemiker-Zeitung Repertorium, Oct. 1889, S. 269.\r\n\r\n[346] Hoppe-Seyler, Handbuch der physiologisch- und\r\npathologisch-chemischen Analyse, S. 269.\r\n\r\n[347] Wiley, American Chemical Journal, Vol. 6, p. 289.\r\n\r\n[348] Dragendorff’s Plant Analysis, p. 55.\r\n\r\n[349] This work, Vol. 2, pp. 192 et seq.\r\n\r\n[350] Chemiker-Zeitung, Band 20, S. 151.\r\n\r\n[351] This work, Vol. 2, p. 207.\r\n\r\n[352] Landwirtschaftlichen Versuchs-Stationen, Band 17, S. 321:\r\nZeitschrift für analytische Chemie, Band 14, S. 380.\r\n\r\n[353] Vid. op. cit. 12, p. 245.\r\n\r\n[354] Landwirtschaftlichen Versuchs-Stationen, Band 16, S. 61.\r\n\r\n[355] Berichte der deutschen chemischen Gesellschaft, Band 10, Ss. 85,\r\n199; Band 16, S. 312: Chemiker-Zeitung, Band 20, S. 145.\r\n\r\n[356] Zeitschrift für analytische Chemie, Band 22, S. 325.\r\n\r\n[357] Richardson and Crampton, Berichte der deutschen chemischen\r\nGesellschaft, Band 19, S. 1180.\r\n\r\n[358] Maxwell, American Chemical Journal, Vol. 13, p. 470.\r\n\r\n[359] Vid. op. cit. supra, Vol. 15, p. 185.\r\n\r\n[360] Vid. op. cit. supra, Vol. 13, p. 13: Schulze, Zeitschrift\r\nphysiologische Chemie, Band 14, S. 491.\r\n\r\n[361] This work, Vol. I, p. 411.\r\n\r\n[362] Vid. op. cit., 22, Vol. 13, p. 15.\r\n\r\n[363] Vid. op. cit. supra, Vol. 15, p. 188.\r\n\r\n[364] Hoppe-Seyler, Handbuch der physiologisch- und\r\npathologisch-chemischen Analyse, S. 169.\r\n\r\n[365] This work, Vol. 2, p. 225.\r\n\r\n[366] Bulletin No. 45, Division of Chemistry, U.

Introductory.=—The importance of dairy products has led to the\r\npublication of a vast amount of literature relating thereto, and it\r\nseems almost a hopeless task to present even a typical abstract of\r\nthe various analytical processes which have been proposed and used in\r\ntheir study. The general principles which have been developed in the\r\npreceding parts of this volume are applicable to the study of dairy\r\nproducts, and the analyst who is guided by them can intelligently\r\nexamine the bodies specially considered in the present part. There\r\nhave been developed, however, many valuable processes for the special\r\nexamination of dairy products, which are of such a nature that they\r\ncould not be properly discussed in the preceding pages. In the present\r\npart an effort will be made to present in a typical form the most\r\nimportant of these processes and to state the general principles on\r\nwhich they are based. This subject is naturally subdivided into three\r\nparts, _viz._, milk, butter and cheese. The milk sugar industry is not\r\nof sufficient importance to receive a special classification.\r\n\r\n\r\nMILK.\r\n\r\n=427. Composition of Milk.=—The composition of milk not only varies\r\nwith the genus and species of the mammal from which it is derived, but\r\nalso depends in a marked degree on idiosyncrasy.[400]\r\n\r\nMilk is a mixture containing water, proteids, fat, carbohydrates,\r\norganic and inorganic acids and mineral salts. There have also been\r\nobserved in milk in minute quantities ammonia, urea, hypoxanthin,\r\nchyme, chyle, biliverdin, cholesterin, mucin, lecithin, kreatin, leucin\r\nand tyrosin. In the fermentation which milk undergoes in incipient\r\ndecomposition there is sometimes developed from the proteid matter, as\r\npointed out by Vaughn, a ptomaine, tyrotoxicon, which is a virulent\r\npoison.[401] The presence of these last named bodies is of interest\r\nchiefly to the physiologist and pathologist and can receive no further\r\nattention here.\r\n\r\nFrom a nutritive point of view, the important components of milk are\r\nthe fats, proteids and sugar, but especially in the nourishment of the\r\nyoung the value of lime and phosphoric acid must be remembered. The\r\nmean composition of the most important milks, as determined by recent\r\nanalyses, is given below:\r\n\r\n            Water.     Sugar.    Proteids.    Fat.       Ash.\r\n           Per cent.

Alterability of Milk.=—The natural souring and coagulation of\r\nmilk is attributed by most authorities to bacterial action produced\r\nby infection from the air or containing vessels.[406] Pasteur, however,\r\nshows that fresh milk sterilized at a temperature of 110° may be\r\nexposed to the air without danger of souring.[407] After about three\r\ndays, however, a fermentation is set up which is totally different from\r\nthat produced by the microzymes naturally present in the milk. This\r\npoint has been further investigated by Béchamp, who finds that the\r\nnatural souring of milk is accomplished without the evolution of any\r\ngas, while the fermentation produced in sterilized milk by the microbes\r\nof the air, is uniformly attended by a gaseous development.[408] As a\r\nresult of his investigations, he concludes that the souring of milk\r\ntakes place spontaneously by reason of milk being an organic matter,\r\nin the physiological sense of the term, and that this alteration is\r\nproduced solely by the natural microzymes of the milk.\r\n\r\nAccording to Béchamp, the milk derived from healthy animals is capable\r\nof spontaneous alteration, which consists in the development of lactic\r\nacid and alcohol, and of curd in those milks which contain caseinates\r\nproduced by the precipitating action of the acids formed. Oxygen and\r\nthe germs which are present in the air, according to him, have nothing\r\nto do with this alteration in the properties of milk. Milk belongs\r\nto that class of organic bodies like blood, which are called organic\r\nfrom a physiological point of view, on account of containing automatic\r\nforces which produce rapid changes therein when they are withdrawn\r\nfrom the living organisms.\r\n\r\nAfter milk has become sour by the spontaneous action of the microzymes\r\nwhich it contains, there are developed micro-organisms, such as\r\nvibriones and bacteria from a natural evolution from the microzymes.\r\n\r\nMilk which is sterilized at a high temperature, _viz._, that of boiling\r\nwater or above, is no longer milk in the true physiological sense of\r\nthat term. The globules of the milk undergo changes and the microzymes\r\na modification of their functions, so that in milk thus altered by\r\nheat, they are able to produce a coagulation without development of\r\nacidity. The microzymes thus modified, however, retain to a large\r\nextent their ability to become active. Human milk differs from cow\r\nmilk in containing neither caseinates nor casein, but special proteid\r\nbodies, and also a galactozyme or galactozymase functionally very\r\ndifferent from that which exists in cow milk. The extractive matter\r\nis also a special kind, consisting of milk globules and microzymes\r\nbelonging particularly to it and containing three times less phosphate\r\nand mineral salts than cow milk. Boiling the milk of the cow or other\r\nanimals does not render it similar to that of woman. There is no\r\ntreatment, therefore, of any milk which renders it entirely suited to\r\nthe nourishment of infants. The composition of the milk of the cow may\r\nbe represented by three groups:\r\n\r\n1. Organic elements in suspension; consisting chiefly of the globules\r\nof the milk, which are mostly composed of the fat, of an epidermoid\r\nmembrane containing mineral matter of special soluble albumins and of\r\nmicrozymes containing also mineral matter.\r\n\r\n2. Dissolved constituents; consisting of caseinates, lactalbuminates,\r\ngalactozymase, holding phosphates in combination, lactose, extractive\r\nmatter, organic phosphates of lime, acetates, urea and alcohol.\r\n\r\n3. Mineral matters in solution; consisting of sodium and calcium\r\nchlorids, carbon dioxid and oxygen.[409]\r\n\r\nIt will be noticed from the above classification that Béchamp fails to\r\nmention citrate of lime. It is scarcely necessary to add to this brief\r\nrésumé of the theories of Béchamp that they are entirely at variance\r\nwith the opinions held by nearly all his contemporaries.\r\n\r\n=429. Effects of Boiling on Milk.=—On boiling, the albumin in milk is\r\ncoagulated and on separating the proteid bodies by saturation with\r\nmagnesium sulfate no albumin is found in the filtrate. The total casein\r\nprecipitated from boiled is therefore greater than from unboiled milk.\r\nJager has shown that the casein can be precipitated from boiled milk by\r\nrennet, but with greater difficulty than from unboiled.[410] According\r\nto this author in 3.75 per cent of proteid in milk there are found 3.15\r\nper cent of casein, 0.35 of albumin and 0.25 of globulin.\r\n\r\n=430. Appearance of the Milk.=—The color, taste, odor and other\r\nsensible characters of the milk are to be observed and noted at the\r\ntime the sample is secured. Any variation from the faint yellow color\r\nof the milk is due to some abnormal state. A reddish tint indicates\r\nthe admixture of blood, while a blue color is characteristic of the\r\npresence of unusual micro-organisms. Odor and taste will reveal often\r\nthe character of the food which the animals have eaten. Any marked\r\ndeparture of the sample from the properties of normal milk should at\r\nonce lead to its condemnation for culinary or dietetic purposes.\r\n\r\n=431. Micro-Organisms of the Milk.=—Milk is a natural culture solution\r\nfor the growth of micro-organisms, and they multiply therein with\r\nalmost incredible rapidity. Some of these are useful, as, for instance,\r\nthose which are active in the ripening of cream, and others are of an\r\ninjurious nature, producing fermentations which destroy the sugars or\r\nproteids of the milk and develop acid, alcohol, mucous or ptomaine\r\nproducts. It is not possible here to even enumerate the kinds of\r\nmicro-organisms which abound in milk and the reader is referred to the\r\nstandard works on that subject.[411]\r\n\r\nFor analytical purposes it is important that the sample be kept as\r\nfree as possible of all micro-organisms, good or bad, which may be\r\naccomplished by some of the methods given below.\r\n\r\n=432. Sampling Milk.=—It is not difficult to secure for examination\r\nrepresentative samples of milk, if the proper precautions be taken.\r\nOn the other hand, the ease and rapidity with which a milk undergoes\r\nprofound changes render necessary a careful control of the methods\r\nof taking samples. The most rapid changes to which a mass of milk is\r\nobnoxious are due to the separation of the fat particles and to the\r\naction of bacteria. Even after standing for a few minutes, it will be\r\nfound that the fat globules are not evenly distributed. Before securing\r\nthe sample for analysis, it is necessary to well stir or mix the milk.\r\nA mean sample may also be secured from a can of milk by the sampling\r\ntube devised by Scovell, which will be described below.\r\n\r\nIn securing samples, a full detailed description of the cow or herd\r\nfurnishing them is desirable, together with all other data which seem\r\nto illustrate in any way the general and particular conditions of the\r\ndairy. Samples are to be preserved in clean, well stoppered vessels,\r\nproperly numbered and securely sealed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 106.—SCOVELL’S MILK SAMPLING TUBE.]\r\n\r\n=433. Scovell’s Milk Sampler.=—In sampling large quantities of milk\r\nin pails or shipping cans, it is exceedingly inconvenient to mix the\r\nmilk by pouring from one vessel to another or by any easy process of\r\nstirring. In order to get representative samples in such conditions,\r\nScovell has put in use a sampler, by means of which a typical portion\r\nof the milk may be withdrawn from a can without either pouring or\r\nstirring. The construction of the sampler is shown in Fig. 106,\r\nrepresenting it in outline and longitudinal section. The tube _a_,\r\nmade of brass, is open at both ends and of any convenient dimensions.\r\nIts lower end slides in a large tube _b_, closed at the bottom and\r\nhaving three elliptical, lateral openings _c_, which admit the milk as\r\nthe tube is slowly depressed in the contents of the can. In getting\r\nthe sample, _a_ is raised as shown in profile. When the bottom of\r\n_b_ reaches the bottom of the can _a_ is pushed down as shown in the\r\nsection. The milk contained in the sampler is then readily withdrawn.\r\n\r\n=434. Preserving Milk for Analysis.=—Pasteurizing or boiling the sample\r\nis not advisable by reason of the changes produced in the milk by heat.\r\nThe milk sample may be preserved by adding to it a little chloroform,\r\none part in 100 being sufficient. Boric and salicylic acids may also\r\nbe used, but not so advantageously as formaldehyd or mercuric chlorid.\r\nRideal has observed that one part of formaldehyd will preserve 10,000\r\nparts of milk in a fresh state for seven days. The formaldehyd sold in\r\nthe trade contains about one part of formaldehyd in 320 of the mixture.\r\nOne-half pint of this commercial article is sufficient for about twenty\r\ngallons of milk, corresponding to about one part of pure formaldehyd\r\nto 45,000 parts of milk. Rideal much prefers formalin (formaldehyd) to\r\nborax or boric acid as a milk preservative. No ill effects due to its\r\ntoxic action have been observed, even when it is consumed in a one per\r\ncent solution.[412]\r\n\r\nSamples of milk can be kept in this way from four to six weeks by\r\nadding about one drop of the commercial formaldehyd to each ounce of\r\nsample. The analyst should remember in such cases that the formaldehyd\r\nmay not all escape on evaporation, on account of forming some kind of\r\na compound with the constituents of the milk, as is pointed out by\r\nBevan.[413]\r\n\r\nBevan suggests that the formaldehyd may not actually be retained in the\r\nsample, but that the increase in the apparent amount of total solids\r\nis due to the conversion of the lactose into galactose. This point,\r\nhowever, has not been determined.\r\n\r\nRichmond and Boseley propose to detect formalin by means of\r\ndiphenylamin. A solution of diphenylamin is made with water, with the\r\nhelp of just enough sulfuric acid to secure a proper solvent effect.\r\nThe liquid to be tested, which is supposed to contain formaldehyd, or\r\nthe distillate therefrom, is added to this solution and boiled. If\r\nformaldehyd be present, a white flocculent precipitate is deposited,\r\nwhich is colored green if the acid used contain nitrates. For other\r\nmethods of detecting formalin and for a partial literature of the\r\nsubject the paper mentioned above may be consulted.\r\n\r\nOne gram of fine-ground mercuric chlorid dissolved in 2,000 grams of\r\nmilk will preserve it, practically unchanged, for several days. One\r\ngram of potassium bichromate dissolved in one liter of milk will also\r\npreserve it for some time. Thymol, hydrochloric acid, carbon disulfid,\r\nether and other antiseptics may also be employed. No more of the\r\npreserving agent should be used than is required to keep the milk until\r\nthe analysis is completed.\r\n\r\nAll methods of preservation are rendered more efficient by the\r\nmaintenance of a low temperature, whereby the vitality of the bacteria\r\nis greatly reduced.\r\n\r\n=435. Freezing Point of Milk.=—By reason of its content of sugar and\r\nother dissolved solids, the freezing point of milk is depressed below\r\n0°. A good idea of the purity of whole milk is secured by subjecting\r\nit to a kryoscopic test. The apparatus employed for this purpose is\r\nthat used in general analytical work in the determination of freezing\r\npoints. Pure full milk freezes at about 0°.55 below zero, and any\r\nmarked variation from this number shows adulteration or abnormal\r\ncomposition.[414] A simple apparatus, especially adapted to milk, is\r\ndescribed by Beckmann.[415] The kryoscopic investigation may also be\r\nextended to butter fat dissolved in benzol.\r\n\r\n=436. Electric Conductivity of Milk.=—The electric conductivity of milk\r\nmay also be used as an index of its composition. The addition of water\r\nto milk diminishes its conductivity.[416] This method of investigation\r\nhas at present but little practical value.\r\n\r\n=437. Viscosity Of Milk.=—The viscosity of milk may be determined by\r\nthe methods already described. Any variation from the usual degree\r\nof fluidity is indicated either by the abstraction of some of the\r\ncontents of the milk, the addition of some adulterant or the result of\r\nfermentation.\r\n\r\n=438. Acidity and Alkalinity of Milk.=—Fresh milk of normal\r\nconstitution has an amphoteric reaction. It will redden blue and blue\r\nred litmus paper. This arises from the presence in the milk of both\r\nneutral and acid phosphates of the alkalies. A saturated alkaline\r\nphosphate, _i. e._, one in which all the acid hydrogen of the acid\r\nhas been replaced by the base has an alkaline reaction while the\r\nacid phosphates react acid. When fresh milk is boiled its reaction\r\nbecomes strongly alkaline and this arises chiefly from the escape\r\nof the dissolved carbon dioxid. By the action of micro-organisms on\r\nthe lactose of milk, the alkaline reaction soon becomes acid, and\r\ndelicate test paper will show this decomposition long before it becomes\r\nperceptible to the taste. It is advisable to test the reactions of the\r\nmilk as soon as possible after it is drawn from the udder, both before\r\nand after boiling.\r\n\r\n=439. Determination of the Acidity of Milk.=—In the determination of\r\nthe acidity of milk it is important that it first be freed of the\r\ncarbon dioxid it contains.[417] Van Slyke has found that too high\r\nresults are obtained by the direct titration of milk for acidity, and\r\nwhen the milk is previously diluted the results are also somewhat too\r\nhigh.[418] Good results are got by diluting the milk with hot water\r\nand boiling for a short time to expel the carbon dioxid. Twenty-five\r\ncubic centimeters of milk are diluted with water to about a quarter of\r\na liter, as above, two cubic centimeters of a one per cent alcoholic\r\nphenolphthalien added and the titration accomplished by decinormal\r\nalkali. This variation of the methods of procedure, suggested by\r\nHopkins and Powers, appears to be the best process at present known for\r\nthe determination of acidity. The reader is referred to the paper cited\r\nabove for references to other methods which have been proposed.\r\n\r\n=440. Opacity Of Milk.=—The white color and opacity of milk are\r\ndoubtless due to the presence of the suspended fat particles and to\r\nthe colloid casein. On the latter it is probably principally dependent\r\nsince the color of milk is not very sensibly changed after it has\r\npassed the extractor, which leaves not to exceed one-tenth of one per\r\ncent of fat in it. Some idea of the quality of the milk, however, may\r\nbe obtained by determining its opacity. This is accomplished by the use\r\nof a lactoscope. The one generally employed was devised by Feser and is\r\nshown in Fig. 107.\r\n\r\nThe instrument consists of a cylindrical glass vessel of a little more\r\nthan 100 cubic centimeters content, in the lower part of which is set a\r\ncone of white glass marked with black lines. Into this part are placed\r\nfour cubic centimeters of milk. A small quantity of water is added and\r\nthe contents of the vessel shaken. This operation is repeated until the\r\nblack lines on the white glass just become visible. The graduations on\r\nthe left side show the volume of water which is necessary to bring the\r\ndark lines into view, while those on the right indicate approximately\r\nthe percentage of fat present.\r\n\r\nAmong the other lactoscopes which have been used may be mentioned\r\nthose of Donné, Vogel, Hoppe-Seyler, Trommer, Seidlitz, Reischauer,\r\nMittelstrass, Hénocque, and Heusner.[419] Since the invention of so many\r\nquick and accurate methods of fat estimation these instruments have\r\nlittle more than a historical interest.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 107.—LACTOSCOPE, LACTOMETER AND CREAMOMETER.]\r\n\r\n=441. Creamometry.=—The volume of cream which a sample of milk affords\r\nunder arbitrary conditions of time and temperature is sometimes of\r\nvalue in judging the quality of milk. A convenient creamometer is\r\na small cylinder graduated in such a way that the volume of cream\r\nseparated in a given time can be easily noted. There are many kinds of\r\napparatus used for this purpose, a typical one being shown in Fig. 107.\r\n\r\nThe usual time of setting is twenty-four hours. A quicker determination\r\nis secured by placing the milk in strong glass graduated tubes and\r\nsubjecting these to centrifugal action. The process is not exact and\r\nis now rarely practiced as an analytical method, even for valuing the\r\nbutter making properties of milk.\r\n\r\n=442. Specific Gravity.=—The specific gravity of milk is uniformly\r\nreferred to a temperature of 15°. Generally no attempt is made to free\r\nthe milk of dissolved gases beforehand. This should not be done by\r\nboiling but by placing the sample in a vacuum for some time. Any of the\r\nmethods described for determining specific gravity in sugar solutions\r\nmay be used for milk (=48-59=). The specific gravity of milk varies in\r\ngeneral from 1.028 to 1.034. Nearly all good cow milk from herds will\r\nshow a specific gravity varying from 1.030 to 1.032. In extreme cases\r\nfrom single cows the limits may exceed those first given above, but\r\nsuch milk cannot be regarded as normal.\r\n\r\nIncreasing quantities of solids not fat in solution, tend to increase\r\nthe specific gravity, while an excess of fat tends to diminish it.\r\nThere is a general ratio existing between the solids not fat and\r\nthe fat in cow milk, which may be expressed as 9: 4. The removal of\r\ncream and the addition of water in such a manner as not to affect the\r\nspecific gravity of the sample disturbs this ratio.\r\n\r\nThe determination of the specific gravity alone, therefore, cannot be\r\nrelied upon as an index of the purity of a milk.\r\n\r\n=443.= =Lactometry.=—A hydrometer especially constructed for use in\r\ndetermining the density of milk is called a lactometer. In this country\r\nthe one most commonly used is known as the lactometer of the New York\r\nBoard of Health. It is a hydrometer, delicately constructed, with a\r\nlarge cylindrical air space and a small stem carrying the thermometric\r\nand lactometric scales. It is shown held in the creamometer in Fig.\r\n107. The milk is brought to a temperature of 60° F. and the reading\r\nof the lactometer scale observed. This is converted into a number\r\nexpressing the specific gravity by means of a table of corresponding\r\nvalues given below. Each mark on the scale of the instrument\r\ncorresponds to two degrees and these marks extend from 0° to 120°.\r\nThe numbers of this scale can be converted into those corresponding\r\nto the direct reading instrument, described in the next paragraph, by\r\nmultiplying them by 0.29.\r\n\r\nThe minimum density for whole milk at 60° F. is fixed by this\r\ninstrument at 100°, corresponding to a specific gravity of 1.029. The\r\ninstrument is also constructed without the thermometric scale. The\r\nmean density of many thousand samples of pure milk, as observed by the\r\nNew York authorities, is 1.0319.\r\n\r\nThe specific gravity is easily secured, and while not of itself\r\ndecisive, should always be determined. The specific gravity of milk\r\nincreases for some time after it is drawn and should be made both when\r\nfresh and after the lapse of several hours.[420]\r\n\r\nTABLE SHOWING SPECIFIC GRAVITIES CORRESPONDING TO DEGREES OF THE NEW\r\nYORK BOARD OF HEALTH LACTOMETER.

The figures given represent those found in the second and third\r\ndecimal places of the number expressing the specific gravity. Thus 31\r\non the scale indicates a specific gravity of 1.031. This instrument is\r\nalso known as the lactometer of Quévenne. For use with milk, the scale\r\nof the instrument does not need to embrace a wider limit than from\r\n25 to 35, and such an instrument is capable of giving more delicate\r\nreadings than when the scale extends from 14 to 42, as is usually the\r\ncase with the quévenne instrument.\r\n\r\nLanglet has invented a lactoscope with a scale, showing the corrections\r\nto be applied for temperatures other than 15°. A detailed description\r\nof this instrument, as well as the one proposed by Pinchon, is\r\nunnecessary.[421]\r\n\r\n=445. Density of Sour Milk.=—Coagulated milk cannot be used directly\r\nfor the determination of the specific gravity, both because of its\r\nconsistence and by reason of the fact that the fat is more or less\r\ncompletely separated. In such a case, the casein may be dissolved by\r\nthe addition of a measured quantity of a solvent of a known specific\r\ngravity, the density of the resulting solution determined and that\r\nof the original milk calculated from the observed data. Ammonia is a\r\nsuitable solvent for this purpose.[422]\r\n\r\n=446. Density of the Milk Serum.=—The specific gravity of the milk\r\nserum, after the removal of the fat and casein by precipitation and\r\nfiltration, may also be determined. For normal cow milk the number is\r\nabout 1.027.\r\n\r\n=447. Total Solids.=—The direct gravimetric determination of the total\r\nsolids in milk is attended with many difficulties, and has been the\r\ntheme of a very extended periodical literature. A mere examination of\r\nthe many processes which have been proposed would require several pages.\r\n\r\nThe most direct method of procedure is to dry a small quantity of milk\r\nin a flat-bottom dish to constant weight on a steam-bath. The surface\r\nof the dish should be very large, even for one or two grams of milk;\r\nin fact the relation between the quantity of milk and the surface of\r\nthe dish should be such that the fluid is just sufficient in amount to\r\nmoisten the bottom of the dish with the thinnest possible film. The\r\ndish, during drying, is kept in a horizontal position at least until\r\nits contents will not flow. The water of the sample will be practically\r\nall evaporated in about two hours. The operation may be accelerated by\r\ndrying in vacuo.\r\n\r\nThe drying may also be accomplished by using a flat-bottom dish\r\ncontaining some absorbent, such as sand, pumice stone, asbestos or\r\ncrysolite. The milk may also be absorbed by a dried paper coil and\r\ndried thereon (=26=).\r\n\r\nIt is convenient to determine the water in the sample subsequently\r\nto be used for the gravimetric determination of the fat, and this is\r\nsecured by the adoption of the paper coil method, as suggested by the\r\nauthor, or by the use of a perforated metal tube containing porous\r\nasbestos, as proposed by Babcock.[423]\r\n\r\nThe process is conveniently carried out as follows:\r\n\r\nProvide a hollow cylinder of perforated sheet metal sixty millimeters\r\nlong and twenty millimeters in diameter, closed five millimeters from\r\none end by a disk of the same material. The perforations should be\r\nabout 0.7 millimeter in diameter and as close together as possible.\r\nFill loosely with from one and a half to two and a half grams of dry\r\nwoolly asbestos and weigh. Introduce a weighed quantity of milk (about\r\nfive grams). Dry at 100° for four hours. During the first part of the\r\ndrying the door of the oven should be left partly open to allow escape\r\nof moisture. Cool in a desiccator and weigh. Repeat the drying until\r\nthe weight remains constant. Place in an extractor and treat with\r\nanhydrous ether for two hours. Evaporate the ether and dry the fat at\r\n100°. The extracted fat is weighed and the number thus obtained may be\r\nchecked by drying and weighing the cylinder containing the residue.\r\n\r\nThe asbestos best suited for use in this process should be of a woolly\r\nnature, quite absorbent, and, previous to use, be ignited to free it\r\nof moisture and organic matter. A variety of serpentine, crysolite is\r\nsometimes used instead of asbestos. When the content of water alone is\r\ndesired, it is accurately determined by drying in vacuo over pumice\r\nstone (page 33).\r\n\r\nThe methods above mentioned are typical and will prove a sufficient\r\nguide for conducting the desiccation, either as described or by any\r\nmodification of the methods which may be preferred.\r\n\r\n=448. Calculation of Total Solids.=—By reason of the ease and\r\ncelerity with which the density of a milk and its content of fat\r\ncan be obtained, analysts have found it convenient to calculate the\r\npercentage of total solids instead of determining it directly. This\r\nis accomplished by arbitrary formulas based on the data of numerous\r\nanalyses. These formulas give satisfactory results when the samples do\r\nnot vary widely from the normal and may be used with advantage in most\r\ncases.\r\n\r\nAmong the earliest formulas for the calculation may be mentioned those\r\nof Fleischmann and Morgen,[424] Behrend and Morgen,[425] Claus, Stutzer\r\nand Meyer,[426] Hehner,[427] and Hehner and Richmond.[428] Without doing\r\nmore than citing these papers it will be sufficient here to give the\r\nformulas as corrected by the most recent experience.\r\n\r\nIn the formula worked out by Babcock the specific gravity of the sample\r\nis represented by _S_, the fat by _F_, and the solids not fat by _t_.\r\nThe formula is written as follows:[429]\r\n\r\n             100_S_ - _FS_\r\n    _t_ = ( -----------------  -  1)(250 - 2.5 _F_).\r\n             100 - 1.0753_FS_\r\n\r\nIn this formula it is assumed that the difference between the specific\r\ngravity of the milk serum and that of water is directly proportional\r\nto the per cent of solids in the serum, but this assumption is not\r\nstrictly correct. Even in extreme cases, however, the error does not\r\namount to more than 0.05 per cent.\r\n\r\nSince a given amount of milk sugar increases the density of a milk\r\nmore than the same quantity of casein, it is evident that the formula\r\nwould not apply to those instances in which the ratio between these two\r\ningredients is greatly disturbed, as for instance, the whey.\r\n\r\nThe formula of Hehner and Richmond, in its latest form, is expressed as\r\nfollows:\r\n                  _G_\r\n     _T_ = 0.2625 ---- + 1.2_F_,\r\n                  _D_\r\n\r\nin which _T_ represents the total solids, _G_ the reading of the\r\nquévenne lactometer, _D_ the specific gravity, and _F_ the fat.\r\n\r\n_Example._—Let the reading of the lactometer be 31, corresponding to\r\n_D_ 1.031, and the percentage of fat be three and five-tenths, what is\r\nthe percentage of the total solids?\r\n\r\nSubstituting these values in the formulas we have\r\n\r\n                  31\r\n    _T_ = 0.2625 ----- + 1.2 × 3.5 = 12.09.\r\n                 1.031\r\n\r\nTo simplify the calculations, Richmond’s formula may be written\r\n\r\n           _G_     6_F_\r\n    _T_ = ----- + ----- + 0.14.\r\n            4       5\r\n\r\nCalculated by this shortened formula from the above data _T_ = 12.09,\r\nthe same as given in the larger formula.\r\n\r\nCalculating the solids not fat in the hypothetical case given above by\r\nBabcock’s formula, we get _t_ = 8.46, and this plus 3.5 gives 11.96,\r\nwhich is slightly lower than the number obtained by the richmond\r\nprocess.\r\n\r\nThe babcock formula may be simplified by substituting the number\r\nexpressing the reading of the quévenne lactometer for that donating the\r\nspecific gravity, in other words, the specific gravity multiplied by\r\n100 and the quotient diminished by 1000.\r\n\r\nThe formulas for solids not fat and total solids then become\r\n\r\n          _L_                       _L_\r\n    _t_ = ---- + 0.2_F_, and _T_ = ----- + 1.2_F_,\r\n           4                         4\r\n\r\nin which _L_ represents the reading of the lactometer. By the addition\r\nof the constant factor 0.14 the results calculated by the formula of\r\nBabcock are the same as those obtained by the method of Richmond.\r\n\r\nIn the following table are given the solids not fat in milks as\r\ncalculated by Babcock’s formula.

Determination of Ash.=—In the determination of the solid residue\r\nobtained by drying milk, it is important to observe the directions\r\nalready given (=28-32=).\r\n\r\nIn the direct ignition of the sample, a portion of the sulfur and\r\nphosphorus may escape oxidation and be lost as volatile compounds.\r\nThis loss may be avoided by the use of proper oxidizing agents or by\r\nconducting the combustion as heretofore described.[430] In the official\r\nmethod, it is directed to add six cubic centimeters of nitric acid to\r\ntwenty of milk, evaporate to dryness and ignite the residue at a low\r\nred heat until free of carbon.[431] It is doubtful if this precaution\r\nbe entirely sufficient to save all the sulfur and phosphorus, but\r\nthe method is evidently more reliable than the common one of direct\r\nignition without any oxidizing reagent whatever.\r\n\r\n\r\nESTIMATION OF FAT.\r\n\r\n=450. Form of Fat in Milk.=—The fat in milk occurs in the form of\r\nglobules suspended in the liquid, in other words in the form of an\r\nemulsion. Many authorities have asserted that each globule of fat is\r\ncontained in a haptogenic membrane composed presumably of nitrogenous\r\nmatter, but there is no convincing evidence of the truth of this\r\nopinion. The weight of experimental evidence is in the opposite\r\ndirection. The supposed action of the membrane and the phenomena\r\nproduced thereby are more easily explained by the surface tension\r\nexisting between the fat globules and the menstruum in which they are\r\nsuspended.\r\n\r\nBabcock affirms that the spontaneous coagulation of the fibrin present\r\nin milk tends to draw the fat globules into clusters, and this tendency\r\ncan be arrested by adding a little soda or potash lye to the milk as\r\nsoon as it is drawn.[432]\r\n\r\nThe diameter of the fat globules is extremely variable, extending in\r\nsome cases from two to twenty micromillimeters. In cow milk, the usual\r\ndiameters are from three to five micromillimeters.\r\n\r\n=451. Number of Fat Globules in Milk.=—The number of fat globules in\r\nmilk depends on their size and the percentage of fat. It is evident\r\nthat no definite statement of the number can be made. There is a\r\ntendency, on the part of the globules, to diminish in size and increase\r\nin number as the period of lactation is prolonged. To avoid large\r\nnumbers, it is convenient to give the number of globules in 0.0001\r\ncubic millimeter. This number may be found within wide limits depending\r\non the individual, race, food and other local conditions to which the\r\nanimal or herd is subjected. In general, in whole milk this number will\r\nbe found between 140 and 250.\r\n\r\n=452. Method of Counting Globules.=—The number of globules in milk is\r\ncomputed with the aid of the microscope. The most convenient method\r\nis the one devised by Babcock.[433] In carrying out this computation,\r\ncapillary tubes, from two to three centimeters long and about one-tenth\r\nmillimeter in internal diameter, are provided. The exact diameter of\r\neach tube, in at least three points, is determined by the micrometer\r\nattachment of the microscope, and from these measurements the mean\r\ndiameter of the tube is calculated. This known, its cubic content\r\nfor any given length is easily computed. Ten cubic centimeters of\r\nthe milk are diluted with distilled water to half a liter and one\r\nend of a capillary tube dipped therein. The tube is quickly filled\r\nwith diluted milk and each end is closed with a little wax to prevent\r\nevaporation. Several of these tubes being thus prepared, they are\r\nplaced in a horizontal position on the stage of the microscope and\r\ncovered with glycerol and a cover glass. The tubes are left at rest\r\nfor some time until all the fat globules have attached themselves\r\nto the upper surfaces, in which position they are easily counted.\r\nThe micrometer is so placed as to lie parallel with the tubes, and\r\nthe number of globules, corresponding to each division of its scale,\r\ncounted. The mean number of globules corresponding to each division of\r\nthe micrometer scale is thus determined.\r\n\r\nTo compare the data obtained with each tube they are reduced to a\r\ncommon basis of the number of globules found in a length of fifty\r\ndivisions of the micrometer scale in a tube having a diameter of 100\r\ndivisions, using the formula\r\n\r\n           10000_n_\r\n    _N_ = ---------,\r\n             _d_²\r\n\r\nin which _n_ = the number of globules found in the standard length of\r\ntube measured and _d_ = the diameter of the tube. It is not difficult\r\nto actually count all the globules in a length of fifty divisions of\r\nthe scale, but the computation may also be made from the mean numbers\r\nfound in a few divisions. The usual number of globules found in a\r\nlength of 0.1 millimeter in a tube 0.1 millimeter in diameter, varies\r\nfrom fifty to one hundred.\r\n\r\n_Example._—The length of one division of the micrometer scale is 0.002\r\nmillimeter, and the internal diameter of the tube 0.1 millimeter. The\r\ncontent of a tube, of a length of 0.002 × 50 = 0.1 millimeter, is\r\ntherefore 0.0007854 cubic millimeter.\r\n\r\nThe cubic content of a tube 100 scale divisions in diameter and fifty\r\nin length is 0.0031416 cubic millimeter. The number of globules found\r\nin fifty divisions of the tubes used is 40. Then the number which would\r\nbe contained in a tube of a diameter of 100 divisions of the micrometer\r\nscale and a length of fifty divisions thereof is\r\n\r\n          10000_n_   400000\r\n    _N_ = -------- = ------ = 160.\r\n            _d_²      2500\r\n\r\nSince the milk is diluted fifty times, the actual number of globules\r\ncorresponding to the volume given is 8000. It is convenient to reduce\r\nthe observations to some definite volume, _exempla gratia_, 0.0001\r\ncubic centimeter. The equation for this in the above instance is\r\n0.0031416: 0.0001 = 8000: _x_, whence _x_ = 223, = number of fat\r\nglobules in 0.0001 cubic millimeter.\r\n\r\nIn one cubic millimeter of milk there are therefore 2,230,000 fat\r\nglobules, and in one cubic centimeter 2,230,000,000 globules. In a\r\nsingle drop of milk there are from one to two hundred million fat\r\nglobules.[434]\r\n\r\n=453. Classification of Methods of Determining Fat in Milk.=—The fat,\r\nbeing the most valuable of the constituents of milk, is the subject\r\nof a number of analytical processes. An effort will be made here to\r\nclassify these various methods and to illustrate each class with one\r\nor more typical processes. In general the methods may be divided into\r\nanalytical and commercial, those of the first class being used for\r\nscientific and of the other for trade purposes. For normal milk, some\r\nof the trade methods have proved to be quite as accurate as the more\r\nchronokleptic analytical processes to which, in disputed cases, a final\r\nappeal must be taken. When the analyst is called upon to determine the\r\nfat in a large number of samples of milk some one of the trade methods\r\nmay often be adopted with great advantage.\r\n\r\n=454. Dry Extraction Methods.=—Among the oldest and most reliable\r\nmethods of determining fat in milk, are included those processes based\r\non the principle of drying the milk and extracting the fat from the\r\nresidue by an appropriate solvent. The solvents generally employed are\r\nether and petroleum spirit of low boiling point. The methods of drying\r\nare legion.\r\n\r\nIn extracting with ether, it must not be forgotten that other bodies\r\nthan fat may pass into solution on the one hand and on the other any\r\nsubstituted glycerid, such as lecithin or nuclein, which may be present\r\nmay escape solution, at least in part. Perhaps petroleum spirit,\r\nboiling at from 45° to 60°, is the best solvent for fat, but it is\r\nalmost the universal custom in this and other countries to use ether.\r\n\r\n=455. The Official Methods.=—In the methods adopted by the Association\r\nof Official Agricultural Chemists two processes are recommended.\r\n\r\n(1) _The Asbestos Process_: In this process it is directed to extract\r\nthe residue from the determination of water by the asbestos method\r\n(=447=) with anhydrous pure ether until the fat is removed, evaporate\r\nthe ether, dry the fat at 100° and weigh. The fat may also be\r\ndetermined by difference, after drying the extracted cylinders at 100°.\r\n\r\n(2) _Paper Coil Method_: This is essentially the method proposed by\r\nAdams as modified by the author.[435] Coils made of thick filter paper\r\nare cut into strips 6.25 by 62.5 centimeters, thoroughly extracted with\r\nether and alcohol, or the weight of the extract corrected by a constant\r\nobtained for the paper. If this latter method be used, a small amount\r\nof anhydrous sodium carbonate should be added. Paper free of matters\r\nsoluble in ether is also to be had for this purpose. From a weighing\r\nbottle about five grams of milk are transferred to the coil by a\r\npipette, taking care to keep dry the lower end of the coil. The coil,\r\ndry end down, is placed on a piece of glass, and dried at a temperature\r\nof boiling water for one hour, or better, dried in hydrogen at a\r\ntemperature of boiling water, transferred to an extraction apparatus\r\nand extracted with absolute ether or petroleum spirit boiling at about\r\n45°. The extracted fat is dried in hydrogen and weighed. Experience\r\nhas shown that drying in hydrogen is not necessary. The fat may be\r\nconveniently dried in partial vacuo.\r\n\r\n=456. Variations of Extraction Method.=—The method of preparing the\r\nmilk for fat extraction is capable of many variations. Some of the most\r\nimportant follow:\r\n\r\n(1) _Evaporation on Sand_: The sand should be pure, dry and of uniform\r\nsize of grain. It may be held in a dish or tube. The dish may be made\r\nof tin foil, so that it can be introduced with its contents into the\r\nextraction apparatus after the desiccation is complete. For this\r\npurpose, it is cut into fragments of convenient size after its contents\r\nhave been poured into the extractor. The scissors used are washed with\r\nthe solvent.\r\n\r\n(2) _Evaporation on Kieselguhr_: Dry kieselguhr (infusorial earth,\r\ntripoli) may take the place of the sand as above noted. The\r\nmanipulation is the same as with sand.\r\n\r\n(3) _Evaporation on Plaster of Paris_,[436] (_Soxhlet Method_),[437] (4)\r\n_On Pumice Stone_, (5) _On Powdered Glass_, (6) _On Chrysolite_:[438]\r\nThe manipulation in these cases is conducted as with sand and no\r\ndetailed description is required.\r\n\r\n(7) _Evaporation on Organic Substances_: These variations would fall\r\nunder the general heading of drying on paper. The following materials\r\nhave been used; _viz._, sponge,[439] lint,[440] and wood pulp.[441] In\r\nthese variations the principal precautions to be observed are to secure\r\nthe organic material in a dry state and free of any matter soluble in\r\nthe solvent used.\r\n\r\n(8) _Dehydration with Anhydrous Copper Sulfate_: In this process the\r\nwater of the sample is absorbed by powdered anhydrous copper sulfate,\r\nthe residual mass extracted and the butter fat obtained determined by\r\nsaponification and titration.[442] In the manipulation about twenty\r\ngrams of the anhydrous copper sulfate are placed in a mortar, a\r\ndepression made therein in such a manner that ten cubic centimeters of\r\nmilk can be poured into it without wetting it through to the mortar.\r\nThe water is soon absorbed when the mass is ground with a little dry\r\nsand and transferred to the extractor.\r\n\r\nPetroleum spirit of low boiling point is used as a solvent, successive\r\nportions of about fifteen cubic centimeters each being forced through\r\nthe powdered mass under pressure. Two or three treatments with the\r\npetroleum are required. The residual butter fat, after the evaporation\r\nof the petroleum, is saponified with a measured portion, about\r\ntwenty-five cubic centimeters, of seminormal alcoholic potash lye. The\r\nresidual alkali is determined by titration with seminormal hydrochloric\r\nacid in the usual manner. From the data obtained is calculated the\r\nquantity of alkali employed in the saponification. The weight of butter\r\nfat extracted is then calculated on the assumption that 230 milligrams\r\nof potash are required to saponify one gram of the fat.\r\n\r\n=457. Gypsum Method for Sour Milk.=—In sour milk, extraction of the\r\ndry residue with ether is attended with danger of securing a part of\r\nthe free lactic acid in the extract. This may be avoided, at least\r\nin part, by making the milk neutral or slightly alkaline before\r\ndesiccation. This method is illustrated by a variation of Soxhlet’s\r\nmethod of drying on gypsum proposed by Kühn.[443] The curdled milk is\r\ntreated with potash lye of forty per cent strength until the reaction\r\nis slightly alkaline. For absorbing the sample before drying, a mixture\r\nis employed consisting of twenty-five grams of plaster of paris, four\r\nof precipitated carbonate of lime and two of acid potassium sulfate. To\r\nthis mixture ten grams of the milk, rendered alkaline as above noted,\r\nare added in a desiccating dish, the excess of moisture evaporated at\r\n100°, the residual mass finely ground and extracted with ether for\r\nfour hours. A little gypsum may be found in the solution, but in such\r\nsmall quantities as not to interfere seriously with the accuracy of the\r\nresults obtained.\r\n\r\n=458. Estimation of Fat in Altered Milk.=—In altered milk the lactose\r\nhas usually undergone a fermentation affording considerable quantities\r\nof lactic acid. If such milks be treated by the extraction method for\r\nfat, the results will always be too high, because of the solubility of\r\nlactic acid in ether.\r\n\r\nVizern[444] has proposed to avoid this error by first warming the soured\r\nmilk for a few minutes to 40°, at which temperature the clabber is\r\neasily divided by vigorous shaking. Of the milk thus prepared, thirty\r\ngrams are diluted with two or three volumes of water and poured onto a\r\nsmooth and moistened filter. The vessel and filter are washed several\r\ntimes until the filtrate presents no further acid reaction. The filter\r\nand its contents are next placed in a vessel containing some fine\r\nwashed sand. A small quantity of water is added, sufficient to form a\r\npaste. With a stirring rod, the filter is entirely broken up and the\r\nwhole mass thoroughly mixed. Dried on the water bath the material is\r\nsubjected to extraction in the ordinary way. Several analyses made\r\non fresh milk and on milk kept for several months show that almost\r\nidentical results are obtained.\r\n\r\nIn respect of this process there would be danger, on long standing,\r\nof the formation of free acids from butter glycerids, and these acids\r\nwould be removed by the process of washing prescribed. In this case the\r\nquantity of fat obtained would be less than in the original sample.\r\n\r\n=459. Comparison of Methods.=—An immense amount of work has been done\r\nby analysts in comparing the various types of extraction methods\r\noutlined above.[445]\r\n\r\nThe consensus of opinion is that good results are obtained by all the\r\nmethods when properly conducted, and preference is given to the two\r\nmethods finally adopted by the Association of Official Chemists. As\r\nsolvents, pure ether and petroleum spirit of low boiling point are\r\npreferred. The direct extraction gravimetric processes are important,\r\nsince it is to these that all the other quicker and easier methods must\r\nappeal for the proof of their accuracy.\r\n\r\n=460. Wet Extraction Methods.=—It has been found quite impracticable to\r\nextract the fat from milk by shaking it directly with the solvent. An\r\nemulsion is produced whereby the solvent itself becomes incorporated\r\nwith the other constituents of the milk, and from which it is not\r\nseparated easily even with the aid of whirling. The disturbing element\r\nwhich prevents the separation of the solvent is doubtless the colloid\r\ncasein, since, when this is previously rendered soluble, the separation\r\nof the solvent holding the fat is easily accomplished.\r\n\r\nThe principle on which the methods of wet extraction are based is a\r\nsimple one; _viz._, to secure a complete or partial solution of the\r\ncasein and subsequently to extract the fat with a solvent immiscible\r\nwith water. The methods may be divided into three great classes;\r\n_viz._, (1) those in which the solvent is evaporated from the whole of\r\nthe extracted fat and the residual matters weighed; (2) processes in\r\nwhich an aliquot part of the fat solution is employed and the total fat\r\ncalculated from the data secured; (3) the density of the fat solution\r\nis determined at a definite temperature and the percentage of fat\r\ncorresponding thereto determined from tables or otherwise. Methods (1)\r\nand (2) are practically identical in principle and one or the other may\r\nbe applied according to convenience or to local considerations. The\r\nmethods may be further subdivided in respect of the reagents used to\r\nsecure complete or partial solution of the casein, as, for instance,\r\nalkali or acid.[446]\r\n\r\n=461. Solution in an Acid.=—A good type of these processes is the\r\nmethod of Schmid.[447] In this process ten cubic centimeters of milk\r\nare placed in a test tube of about five times that content, graduated\r\nto measure small volumes. An equal quantity of hydrochloric acid is\r\nadded, the mixture shaken, boiled until it turns dark brown, and cooled\r\nquickly. The fat is extracted by shaking with thirty cubic centimeters\r\nof ether. After standing some time the ethereal solution separates and\r\nits volume is noted. An aliquot part of the solution is removed, the\r\nsolvent evaporated, and the weight of fat in the whole determined by\r\ncalculation.\r\n\r\nThe schmid process has been improved by Stokes,[448] Hill,[449] and\r\nRichmond.[450] The most important of these variations consists in\r\nweighing instead of measuring the milk employed, thus insuring greater\r\naccuracy. Dyer and Roberts affirm that the ether dissolves some of the\r\ncaramel products formed on boiling condensed milk with hydrochloric\r\nacid, and that the data obtained in such cases by the process of Schmid\r\nare too high.[451]\r\n\r\nSince lactic acid is also slightly soluble in ether, sour milk should\r\nnot be extracted with that solvent. In these cases petroleum spirit,\r\nor a mixture of petroleum and ether, as suggested by Pinette, may be\r\nused.[452] Another variation consists in extracting the fat with several\r\nportions of the solvent and evaporating all the extracts thus obtained\r\nto get the total fat. This method is perhaps the best of those in which\r\nthe fat is extracted from the residual liquid after the decomposition\r\nof the casein by an acid, and may be recommended as both reliable and\r\ntypical within the limitations mentioned above.\r\n\r\n=462. Solution in an Alkali.=—The casein of milk is not so readily\r\ndissolved in an alkali as in an acid, but the solution is sufficient\r\nto permit the extraction of the fat. Soda and potash lyes and ammonia\r\nare the alkaline bodies usually employed. To promote the separation\r\nof the emulsions, alcohol is added with advantage. The principle of\r\nthe process rests on the observed power of an alkali to free the fat\r\nglobules sufficiently to allow them to dissolve in ether or some other\r\nsolvent. When the solvent has separated from the emulsion at first\r\nformed, the whole or a part of it is used for the determination of fat\r\nin a manner entirely analogous to that employed in the process with the\r\nacid solutions described above. There are many methods based on this\r\nprinciple, and some of the typical ones will be given below. Experience\r\nhas shown that extraction from an alkaline solution is more troublesome\r\nand less perfect than from an acid and these alkaline methods are,\r\ntherefore, not so much practiced now as they were formerly.\r\n\r\n=463. Method of Short.=—Instead of measuring the volume of the\r\nseparated fat, Short has proposed a method in which the casein is\r\ndissolved in an alkali and the fat at the same time saponified. The\r\nsoap thus produced is decomposed by sulfuric acid and the volume of the\r\nseparated fat acids noted. This volume represents eighty-seven per cent\r\nof the corresponding volume of fat.[453]\r\n\r\nThe solvent employed is a mixture of sodium and potassium hydroxids,\r\ncontaining in one liter 125 and 150 grams, respectively, of these\r\nalkalies. The sample of milk is mixed with half its volume of the\r\nreagent and placed in boiling water for two hours. By this treatment\r\nthe casein is dissolved and the fat saponified. After cooling to about\r\n60°, the soap is decomposed by the addition of equal parts of sulfuric\r\nand acetic acids. The tubes containing the mixture are again placed in\r\nboiling water for an hour and they are then filled with boiling water\r\nto within one inch of the top. The tubes may either be furnished with a\r\ngraduation or the column of fat be measured by a scale.\r\n\r\n=464. Method of Thörner.=—The process of Short is conducted by Thörner\r\nas follows:[454]\r\n\r\nTen cubic centimeters of milk measured at 15° are saponified, in\r\ntubes fitting a centrifugal, by the addition of one and a half cubic\r\ncentimeters of an alcoholic potash lye, containing 160 grams of\r\npotassium hydroxid per liter, or one cubic centimeter of an aqueous\r\nfifty per cent soda lye. The saponification is hastened by setting the\r\ntubes in boiling water, where they remain for two minutes. The soap\r\nformed is decomposed with a strong acid, sulfuric preferred, the tubes\r\nplaced in the centrifugal and whirled for four minutes, when the fat\r\nacids will be formed in the narrow graduated part of the tube and the\r\nvolume occupied thereby is noted after immersion in boiling water.\r\nThörner’s process is not followed in this country, but is used to a\r\nconsiderable extent in Germany.[455]\r\n\r\n=465. Liebermann’s Method.=—In this method, fifty cubic centimeters\r\nof milk, at ordinary temperatures, are placed in a glass cylinder\r\ntwenty-five centimeters high and about four and a half internal\r\ndiameter; five cubic centimeters of potash lye of 1.27 specific gravity\r\nare added, the cylinder closed with a well fitting cork stopper and\r\nthoroughly shaken.[456] After shaking, fifty cubic centimeters of\r\npetroleum spirit, boiling point about 60°, are added. The cylinder is\r\nagain stoppered and vigorously shaken until an emulsion is formed.\r\nTo this emulsion fifty cubic centimeters of alcohol of ninety-five\r\nper cent strength are added, and the whole again thoroughly shaken.\r\nAfter four or five minutes the petroleum spirit, containing the fat,\r\nseparates. In order to insure an absolute separation of the fat,\r\nhowever, the shaking may be repeated three or four times for about\r\none-quarter minute, waiting each time between the shakings until the\r\nspirit separates.\r\n\r\nOf the separated petroleum spirit twenty cubic centimeters are placed\r\nin a small weighed flask. The use of the flask is recommended on\r\naccount of the ease with which the petroleum spirit can be evaporated\r\nwithout danger of loss of fat. Instead of the flask a weighed beaker or\r\nother weighed dish may be employed.\r\n\r\nThe petroleum spirit is carefully evaporated on a water-bath and the\r\nresidue dried at 110° to 120° for one hour. The weight found multiplied\r\nby five gives the content of fat in 100 cubic centimeters of the\r\nmilk. The percentage by weight can then be calculated by taking into\r\nconsideration the specific gravity of the milk employed.\r\n\r\nThe results obtained by this method agree well with those obtained by\r\nthe paper coil method, when petroleum spirit instead of sulfuric ether\r\nis used as the solvent for the fat. Sulfuric ether, however, gives\r\nan apparently higher content of fat because of the solution of other\r\nbodies not fat present in the milk.\r\n\r\n=466. Densimetric Methods.=—Instead of evaporating the separated fat\r\nsolution and weighing the residue, its density may be determined and\r\nthe percentage of fat dissolved therein obtained by calculation, or\r\nmore conveniently from tables. The typical method of this kind is due\r\nto Soxhlet, and until the introduction of modern rapid volumetric\r\nprocesses, it was used perhaps more extensively than any other\r\nproceeding for the determination of fat in milk.[457] The reagents\r\nemployed in the process are ether saturated with water and a potash lye\r\ncontaining 400 grams of potash in a liter. The principle of the process\r\nis based on the assumption that a milk made alkaline with potash will\r\ngive up all its fat when shaken with ether and the quantity of fat in\r\nsolution can be determined by ascertaining the specific gravity of the\r\nethereal solution.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 108. AREOMETRIC FAT APPARATUS.]\r\n\r\nThe apparatus is arranged as shown in Fig. 108, whereby it is easy to\r\ndrive the ethereal fat solution into the measuring vessel by means of\r\nthe bellows shown. In the bottle, seen at the right of the engraving\r\nare placed 200 cubic centimeters of milk, ten of the potash lye and\r\nsixty of the aqueous ether. The milk and potash are first added and\r\nwell shaken, the ether then added, and the contents of the bottle are\r\nshaken until a homogeneous emulsion is formed. The bottle is then set\r\naside for the separation of the ethereal solution, which is promoted\r\nby gently jarring it from time to time. When the chief part of the\r\nsolution has separated, a sufficient quantity of it is driven over\r\ninto the measuring apparatus, by means of the air bulbs, to float the\r\nhydrometer contained in the inner cylinder. After a few moments the\r\nscale of the oleometer is read and the percentage of fat calculated\r\nfrom the table. All the measurements are made at a temperature of\r\n17°.5. The temperature is preserved constant by filling the outer\r\ncylinder of the apparatus with water. If the room be warmer than 17°.5,\r\nthe water added should be at a temperature slightly below that and\r\n_vice versa_. The oleometer carries a thermometer which indicates the\r\nmoment when the reading is to be made.\r\n\r\nThe scale of the oleometer is graduated arbitrarily from 43 to 66,\r\ncorresponding to the specific gravities 0.743 and 0.766, respectively,\r\nor to corresponding fat contents of 2.07 and 5.12 per cent, in the\r\nmilk, a range which covers most normal milks.\r\n\r\nIn the use of the table the per cents corresponding to parts of an\r\noleometer division can be easily calculated.\r\n\r\n    TABLE FOR CALCULATING PER CENT OF FAT IN MILK BY AREOMETRIC METHOD\r\n    OF SOXHLET.\r\n\r\n    Reading of   Per cent fat    Reading of   Per cent fat\r\n    oleometer.    in milk.        oleometer.    in milk.\r\n\r\n       43           2.07            55           3.49\r\n       44           2.18            56           3.63\r\n       45           2.30            57           3.75\r\n       46           2.40            58           3.90\r\n       47           2.52            59           4.03\r\n       48           2.64            60           4.18\r\n       49           2.76            61           4.32\r\n       50           2.88            62           4.47\r\n       51           3.00            63           4.63\r\n       52           3.12            64           4.79\r\n       53           3.25            65           4.95\r\n       54           3.37            66           5.12\r\n\r\n=467. Application of the Areometric Method.=—Soxhlet’s method, as\r\noutlined above, with many modifications, has been extensively used\r\nin Europe and to a limited degree in this country, and the results\r\nobtained are in general satisfactory, when the sample is a mixed one\r\nfrom a large number of cows and of average composition.\r\n\r\nThe author has shown that the process is not applicable to abnormal\r\nmilk and often not to milk derived from one animal alone.[458]\r\n\r\nThe chief difficulty is found in securing a separation of the emulsion.\r\nThis trouble can usually be readily overcome by whirling. Any\r\ncentrifugal machine, which can receive the bottle in which the emulsion\r\nis made, may be employed for that purpose.\r\n\r\nSince the introduction of more modern and convenient methods of fat\r\ndetermination, the areometric method has fallen into disuse and perhaps\r\nis no longer practiced in this country. It is valuable now chiefly from\r\nthe fact that many of the recorded analyses of milk fat were made by\r\nit, and also for its typical character in representing all methods of\r\nanalysis of fat in milk based on the density of ethereal solutions.\r\n\r\n=468. The Lactobutyrometer.=—A typical instrument for measuring the\r\nvolume of fat in a milk is known as Marchand’s lactobutyrometer. It\r\nis based on the observation that ether will dissolve the fat from\r\nmilk when the casein is wholly or partly dissolved by an alkali, and\r\nfurther, that the fat in an impure form can be separated from its\r\nethereal solution by the action of alcohol. Experience has shown\r\nthat all the fat is not separated from the ethereal solution by this\r\nprocess, and also that the part separated is a saturated solution in\r\nether. The method cannot be rigorously placed in the two classes given\r\nabove, but being volumetric demands consideration here chiefly because\r\nof its historical interest.[459]\r\n\r\nThe instrument employed by Marchand is a tube about thirty centimeters\r\nlong and twelve in diameter, closed at one end and marked in three\r\nportions of ten cubic centimeters each. The upper part is divided in\r\ntenths of a cubic centimeter. The superior divisions are subdivided so\r\nthat the readings can be made to hundredths of a cubic centimeter.\r\n\r\nThe tube is filled with milk to the first mark and two or three drops\r\nof a twenty-five per cent solution of soda lye added thereto. Ether is\r\npoured in to the second mark, the tube closed and vigorously shaken.\r\nAlcohol of about ninety per cent strength is added to the upper mark,\r\nthe tube closed, shaken and allowed to stand in a vertical position,\r\nwith occasional jolting, until the separation of the liquids is\r\ncomplete. In order to promote the separation the tube is placed in a\r\ncylinder containing water at 40°.\r\n\r\nWhen the separation is complete the milk serum is found at the bottom,\r\nthe mixture of alcohol and ether in the middle and the fat at the top.\r\nThe mixture of ether and alcohol contains 0.126 gram of fat, and each\r\ncubic centimeter of the separated ether fat 0.233 gram of fat. The\r\ntotal volume of the separated fat, multiplied by 0.233, and the product\r\nincreased by 0.126, will give the weight of fat in the ten cubic\r\ncentimeters of milk employed.\r\n\r\n_Example._—Milk used, ten cubic centimeters of 1.032 specific gravity\r\n= 10.32 grams. The observed volume of the saturated ether fat solution\r\nis two cubic centimeters. Then the weight of fat is 2 × 0.233 + 0.126 =\r\n0.592 gram. The percentage of fat in the sample is 0.592 × 100 ÷ 10.32\r\n= 5.74.\r\n\r\nIn the apparatus used in this laboratory the upper division of the\r\ngraduation is marked 12.6, because this represents the quantity of fat\r\nwhich remains in the ether-alcohol mixture for one liter of milk. From\r\nthis point the graduation is extended downward to ninety-five, which,\r\nfor ten cubic centimeters of milk, represents 0.95 gram. After the fat\r\nhas separated, enough ninety-five per cent alcohol is added to bring\r\nthe upper surface exactly to the graduation 12.6. The number of grams\r\nper liter of milk is then read directly from the scale.\r\n\r\nIn respect of applicability, the observation made regarding Soxhlet’s\r\nareometric method may be repeated.\r\n\r\nIn practical work in this country the lactobutyrometer is no longer\r\nused, but many of the recorded determinations of fat in milk have been\r\nmade by this method.\r\n\r\n=469. Volumetric Methods.=—For practical purposes, the volumetric\r\nmethods of estimating fat in milk have entirely superseded all the\r\nother processes. It has been found that the fat readily separates in a\r\npure state from the other constituents of milk whenever the casein is\r\nrendered completely soluble; whereas no process has yet been devised\r\nwhereby the fat can be easily separated in a pure state from milk\r\nwhich has not been treated with some reagent capable of effecting a\r\nsolution of the casein. The volumetric methods may be divided into\r\ntwo classes; _viz._, (1) Those in which the fat is separated by the\r\nsimple action of gravity, and (2) those in which the natural action\r\nof gravity is supplanted by centrifugal motion. Each of these classes\r\nembraces a large number of variations and some of the typical ones will\r\nbe described in the following paragraphs. As solvents for the casein a\r\nlarge number of reagents has been used, including alkalies and single\r\nand mixed acids. In practice, preference is given to the least complex\r\nand most easily prepared solvents.\r\n\r\n=470. Method Of Patrick.=—A typical illustration of the method of\r\ncollecting the fat after solution of the casein, without the aid of\r\nwhirling, is found in the process devised by Patrick.[460]\r\n\r\nThe solvent employed is a mixture of acetic, sulfuric and hydrochloric\r\nacids, saturated with sodium sulfate, in the respective volumetric\r\nproportions of nine, five and two. The separation is accomplished in a\r\nlarge test tube drawn out near the top into a constricted neck which is\r\ngraduated to measure the volume of the separated fat or to give direct\r\npercentage results.\r\n\r\nThe tube should have a content of about twenty-five cubic centimeters\r\nbelow the upper mark on the neck. In use 10.4 cubic centimeters of\r\nmilk and a sufficient quantity of the mixed acids to fill it nearly\r\nto the upper mark are placed in the tube, together with a piece of\r\npumice stone, and the mixture boiled. On cooling below 100°, the fat\r\nwill separate and the volume thereof may be measured in the constricted\r\nportion of the tube. The volume of the fat may be converted into weight\r\non multiplying by 0.88 at 60°, or more conveniently the percentage\r\nof fat be taken from a table. In practice, the tube is filled with\r\nthe milk and acid mixture nearly up to the neck, its contents well\r\nmixed and additional acid mixture added until the liquid is raised\r\nin the tube above the neck. After mixing a second time, the contents\r\nare boiled for five minutes and the fat allowed to collect in the\r\nexpanded part of the tube above the neck. When the fat has collected,\r\nthe mixture is boiled gently a second time for a few minutes. By this\r\ntreatment the fat is mixed with the upper portions of the acid liquid\r\nand clarified. The clearing of the fat may be hastened by sprinkling\r\nover it a little effloresced sodium sulfate. The fat is brought into\r\nthe graduated neck by opening a small orifice in the belly of the tube,\r\nwhich is closed by means of a rubber band. When the temperature has\r\nreached 60°, the space occupied by the fat is noted and the numbers\r\nobtained express the percentage of fat in the sample.\r\n\r\nThis process is illustrative of the principle of analysis, but is no\r\nlonger used in analytical determinations.\r\n\r\n=471. The Lactocrite.=—One of the earliest methods for fat estimation\r\nin milk, depending on the solution of the casein and the collection\r\nof the fat by means of whirling, is based on the use of a centrifugal\r\nmachine known as the lactocrite. This apparatus is modeled very like\r\nthe machine usually employed for creamery work,[461] and at one time\r\nwas extensively used, but it has now given place to less troublesome\r\nand expensive machines. The acid mixture for freeing the fat of casein\r\nis composed of glacial acetic acid carrying five per cent of sulfuric.\r\nThe samples of milk are heated with the acid mixture in test tubes\r\nprovided with stoppers and short glass tubes to return the condensation\r\nproducts. The hot mixture is poured into a small metallic cylindrical\r\ncup holding about three cubic centimeters. This cup fits by means of\r\nan accurately ground shoulder on a metal casing, carrying inside a\r\nheavy glass graduated tube of small internal diameter. The excess of\r\nthe milk mixture escapes through a small aperture in the metallic screw\r\ncap of the metal holder. The metal holder is cut away on both sides in\r\norder to expose the graduations on the glass tube. The glass tube is\r\nheld water-tight by means of perforated elastic washers. Thus prepared\r\nthe tubes are inserted in the radial holes of a revolving steel disk\r\npreviously heated to a temperature of 60°. The whirling is accomplished\r\nin a few minutes by imparting to the steel disk a speed of about 6,000\r\nrevolutions per minute. At the end of this operation the fat is found\r\nin a clear column in the small glass tube and the number of the\r\ndivisions it occupies in this tube is noted. Each division of the scale\r\nrepresents one-tenth per cent of fat.\r\n\r\nThis apparatus is capable of giving accurate results when all its parts\r\nare in good working order. In this laboratory the chief difficulty\r\nwhich its use has presented is in keeping the joints in the glass metal\r\ntube tight.\r\n\r\nThis description of the apparatus is given to secure an illustration of\r\nthe principle involved, a principle which has been worked out in later\r\ntimes into some of the most rapid and practical processes of estimating\r\nfat in milk.\r\n\r\n=472. Modification of Lindström.=—Many modifications have been proposed\r\nfor conducting the determination of fat by means of the lactocrite,\r\nbut they do not involve any new principle and are of doubtful merit.\r\nIn the modification suggested by Lindström, which has attained quite\r\nan extended practical application, the solvent mixture is composed of\r\nlactic and sulfuric acids and the butyrometer tubes are so changed\r\nas to permit the collection of the fat in the graduated neck after\r\nwhirling, by means of adding water. The apparatus is also adjusted\r\nto secure the congelation of the fat column before its volume is\r\nnoted.[462] The analyst can read the fat volume at his leisure when it\r\nis in the solid state and is not confused by changes of volume during\r\nthe observation. The best acid mixture has been found to be composed of\r\n100 volumes of lactic, an equal amount of acetic and fifteen volumes of\r\nsulfuric acids.[463]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 109. BABCOCK’S BUTYROMETER AND ACID MEASURE.]\r\n\r\n=473. The Babcock Method.=—Among the many quick volumetric methods\r\nwhich have been proposed for the determination of fat in milk, none has\r\nsecured so wide an application as that suggested by Babcock.[464]\r\n\r\nThe chief point of advantage in the use of this method is found in\r\neffecting the solution of the casein by means of sulfuric acid of about\r\n1.83 specific gravity. By this reagent the casein is dissolved in a few\r\nmoments without the aid of any other heat than that generated by mixing\r\nthe milk with the reagent. The bottle in which the separation is made\r\nis shown in Fig. 109. The graduations on the neck are based on the use\r\nof eighteen grams of milk. To avoid the trouble of weighing, the milk\r\nis measured from a pipette graduated to deliver eighteen grams of milk\r\nof the usual specific gravity. While it is true that normal milk may\r\nvary somewhat in its density, it has been found that a pipette marked\r\nat 17.6 cubic centimeters delivers a weight which can be safely assumed\r\nto vary but slightly from the one desired. The graduated bottle holds\r\neasily thirty-five cubic centimeters of liquid in its expanded portion\r\nand the volume of milk just noted is mixed with an equal volume of\r\nsulfuric acid, conveniently measured from the lip cylinder shown in the\r\nfigure. The complete mixture of the milk and acid is effected by gently\r\nrotating the bottle until its contents are homogeneous. The final color\r\nof the mixture varies from dark brown to black.\r\n\r\nWhile still hot, the bottles are placed in a centrifugal machine and\r\nwhirled for at least five minutes. The most convenient machine, where\r\nit is available, is the one driven by a jet of steam. The revolutions\r\nof the centrifugal should be at least 700 per minute for a twenty inch\r\nand 1,200 for a twelve inch wheel. After five minutes the bottles are\r\nremoved and filled to the upper mark or nearly so with hot water,\r\nreplaced in the machine and whirled for at least one minute. The fat\r\nwill then be found in a clearly defined column in the graduated neck of\r\nthe bottle. In reading the scale, the extreme limits between the lowest\r\npoint marked by the lower meniscus and the highest point marked by the\r\nedge of the upper meniscus are to be regarded as the termini of the fat\r\ncolumn.\r\n\r\nIn testing cream by the babcock process, it may either be diluted\r\nuntil the column of fat secured is contained in the graduated part of\r\nthe neck or specially graduated bottles may be used.\r\n\r\n_Condensed Milk_: In applying the babcock test to condensed milk, it is\r\nnecessary to weigh the sample and to use only about eight grams.[465]\r\nThis quantity is placed in the bottle and dissolved in ten cubic\r\ncentimeters of water and the analysis completed as above. The reading\r\nnoted is multiplied by eighteen and divided by the weight of the sample\r\ntaken.\r\n\r\n_Skim Milk_: In determining the fat in skim milk and whey, it is\r\ndesirable to use a bottle of double the usual capacity, but with the\r\nsame graduation on the neck. The percentage of fat noted is divided by\r\ntwo.\r\n\r\n_Cheese_: Five grams are a convenient quantity of cheese to employ.\r\nTo this quantity in the bottle are added fifteen cubic centimeters\r\nof hot water and the flask gently shaken and warmed until the cheese\r\nis softened. The treatment with acid and whirling are the same as\r\ndescribed above. The noted reading is multiplied by eighteen and\r\ndivided by five.\r\n\r\n=474. Solution in Amyl Alcohol and Hydrochloric and Sulfuric\r\nAcids.=—Leffmann and Beam have proposed to aid the solution of the\r\ncasein in sulfuric acid by the previous addition to the milk of a\r\nmixture of equal volumes of amyl alcohol and hydrochloric acid.[466]\r\nIn this process the same graduated flasks may be used as in the\r\nbabcock process, or a special flask may be employed. In this case the\r\ngraduation of the neck is for fifteen cubic centimeters of milk, and\r\neach one and a half cubic centimeters is divided into eighty-six parts.\r\nThe quantity of milk noted is placed in the flask, together with three\r\ncubic centimeters of the mixture of amyl alcohol and hydrochloric acid,\r\nand well shaken. To the mixture, sulfuric acid of 1.83 specific gravity\r\nis added until the belly of the flask is nearly full and the contents\r\nwell mixed by shaking. When the casein is dissolved, the addition of\r\nthe sulfuric acid is continued until the flask is filled to the upper\r\nmark and again the contents mixed. It is well to close the mouth of\r\nthe flask with a stopper while shaking. The bottle is placed in a\r\ncentrifugal and whirled for a few moments, when the fat is collected in\r\nthe graduated neck and its volume noted.\r\n\r\nThe process is also known in this country as the beimling method.[467]\r\nThe fat separated in the above process is probably mixed with a little\r\nfusel oil, and therefore it is advisable to use the specially graduated\r\nbottle instead of one marked in absolute volumes.[468]\r\n\r\nThe method, when conducted according to the details found in the\r\npapers cited, gives accurate results, but is somewhat more complicated\r\nthan the babcock process and is not now used to any great extent in\r\nanalytical work.\r\n\r\n=475. Method of Gerber.=—The method proposed by Gerber for estimating\r\nfat in milk is based on the processes of Babcock, Beimling and Beam\r\nalready described. The tubes in which the decomposition of the milk and\r\nthe measurement of the fat are accomplished are of two kinds, one open\r\nat only one end for milk and the other open at both ends for cheese.\r\nThey are closed during the separation by rubber stoppers.[469]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 110. GERBER’S BUTYROMETERS.]\r\n\r\nThe apparatus have been greatly improved and simplified since the first\r\ndescription of them was published and have come into extensive use in\r\nEurope and to a limited extent in this country.[470]\r\n\r\nThe butyrometer tubes are made of various sizes and shapes, but the\r\nmost convenient are those noted above as shown in Fig. 110.\r\n\r\nBefore adding the strong sulfuric acid, one cubic centimeter of amyl\r\nalcohol is mixed with the milk in the butyrometer. This admixture\r\nserves to clarify the fat and render the reading more easy.\r\n\r\nThe centrifugal is run by hand, and the required speed of rotation is\r\ngiven it by means of a cord wrapped spirally about its axis, as shown\r\nin Fig. 111. The cord in the new machines is replaced by a leather\r\nstrap working on a ratchet.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 111. GERBER’S CENTRIFUGAL.]\r\n\r\nThe process is more speedy than that of Babcock, and the results have\r\nbeen shown by a large experience to be reliable and accurate.\r\n\r\nThe sulfuric acid employed is of 1.825 to 1.830 specific gravity. There\r\nis no danger of loss by the formation of volatile ethers where the\r\nquantity of amyl alcohol used does not exceed one cubic centimeter.\r\nIn a comparison of the respective merits of the methods of Babcock,\r\nThörner and Gerber, made by Hausamann, the first place is awarded to\r\nthe Gerber process.[471] In the figure 110, the butyrometers marked 2,\r\n5 and 8 are for milk, and those numbered 1, 3 and 7 are for cream\r\nand cheese. In conducting the analysis, ten cubic centimeters of the\r\nsulfuric acid are placed in the butyrometer with one cubic centimeter\r\nof the amyl alcohol. When mixed, eleven cubic centimeters of the\r\nmilk are added and the contents of the tube well mixed, the tube\r\nstoppered and placed in the centrifugal. The larger tubes, open at both\r\nends, require double the quantities of the reagents mentioned. The\r\nmeasurements are made at about 15°.\r\n\r\nMinute directions for conducting the analyses with milk, skim milk,\r\nbuttermilk, cream, condensed milk, cheese and butter accompany each\r\napparatus.\r\n\r\n\r\nPROTEID BODIES IN MILK.\r\n\r\n=476. Kinds of Proteid Bodies in Milk.=—The proteid bodies in milk\r\nare all found in at least partial solution. Some authorities state\r\nthat a portion of the casein is present in the form of fine particles\r\nsuspended after the manner of the fat globules.[472] The number and\r\nkind of proteid bodies are not known with definiteness. Among those\r\nwhich are known with certainty are casein, albumin, peptone and fibrin.\r\nThe latter body was discovered in milk by Babcock.[473] Lactoglobulin\r\nand lactoprotein are also names given to imperfectly known proteid\r\nbodies in milk. Lactoprotein is not precipitated either by acids or\r\nby heat and is therefore probably a peptone. By far the greater part\r\nof the proteid matters in milk is casein. Casein has been called\r\ncaseinogen by Halliburton,[474] and paracasein by Schulze and Röse.[475]\r\nCasein has intimate relations to the mineral matters in milk, and\r\nis probably itself made up of several proteid bodies of slightly\r\ndiffering properties. In general all that class of proteid matter\r\ncontained in milk which is precipitated by rennet or a weak acid, or\r\nspontaneously on the development of lactic acid, is designated by the\r\nterm casein, while the albumins and peptones in similar conditions\r\nremain in solution. Casein contains phosphorus, presumably as nuclein.\r\nFibrin is recognized in milk by the reactions it gives with hydrogen\r\nperoxid or gum guiacum. The decomposition of hydrogen peroxid is not\r\na certain test for fibrin, inasmuch as pus and many other bodies will\r\nproduce the same effect. If the milk decompose hydrogen peroxid,\r\nhowever, before and not after boiling, an additional proof of the\r\npresence of fibrin is obtained, since boiled fibrin does not act on\r\nthe reagent.[476] The gum guiacum test is applied by dipping a strip of\r\nfilter paper into the milk and drying. The solution of gum guiacum is\r\napplied to the dried paper and the presence of fibrin is recognized\r\nby the blue color which is produced. The fibrin is probably changed\r\ninto some other proteid during the ripening of cream in which the\r\nfibrin is chiefly found. The albumin in milk is coagulated by boiling,\r\nwhile the casein remains practically unaffected when subjected to that\r\ntemperature.\r\n\r\n=477. Estimation of Total Proteid Matter.=—The total proteid matter\r\nin milk is determined by any of the general methods applicable to the\r\nestimation of total nitrogen, but the moist combustion method is by far\r\nthe most convenient. From the total nitrogen, that which represents\r\nammonia or other nonproteid nitrogenous bodies, is to be deducted\r\nand the remainder multiplied by an appropriate factor. Practically\r\nall the nitrogen obtained is derived from the proteid matters and,\r\nas a rule, no correction is necessary. The factors employed for\r\ncalculating the weight of proteid matter from the nitrogen obtained\r\nvary from 6.25 to 7.04. It is desirable that additional investigations\r\nbe made to determine the magnitude of this factor. It is suggested\r\nthat provisionally the factor 6.40 be used. In the method adopted by\r\nthe Association of Official Agricultural Chemists it is directed that\r\nabout five grams of milk be placed in the oxidizing flask and treated\r\nwithout previous evaporation exactly as described for the estimation\r\nof total nitrogen in the absence of nitrates. The nitrogen obtained is\r\nmultiplied by 6.25 to get the total proteid matter.[477] In order to\r\nprevent the too great dilution of the sulfuric acid, the milk may be\r\nevaporated to dryness or nearly so before oxidation. In this laboratory\r\nit is conveniently done by placing the milk first in the oxidizing\r\nflask, connecting this with the vacuum service and placing the flask in\r\nhot water. The aqueous contents of the milk are quickly given off at\r\na temperature not exceeding 85°, and the time required is only a few\r\nminutes.\r\n\r\nThe milk may also be dried in dishes made of thin glass or tin foil\r\nand, after desiccation, introduced with the fragments of the dishes\r\ninto the oxidizing flask.\r\n\r\nThe preliminary drying in the oxidizing flask is recommended as the\r\nbest.\r\n\r\nSöldner oxidizes the nitrogen in human milk by boiling ten cubic\r\ncentimeters thereof for three hours with twenty-five of sulfuric\r\nacid, fifty milligrams of copper oxid and three drops of a four per\r\ncent platinic chlorid solution, and, after distilling the ammonia,\r\nuses the factor 6.39 for calculating the proteid matter. According to\r\nthis author human milk is much less rich in nitrogenous constituents\r\nthan is generally supposed, containing not more than one and a half\r\nper cent thereof in average samples collected at least a month after\r\nparturition.[478]\r\n\r\n=478. Precipitation of Total Proteids with Copper Sulfate.=—This method\r\nof throwing out the total proteids of milk is due to Ritthausen.[479]\r\nThe proteids and fat are precipitated together by the addition of a\r\nmeasured volume of copper sulfate solution, containing 63.92 grams\r\nof the crystallized salt in one liter. The process, as modified by\r\nPfeiffer, is conducted as follows:[480]\r\n\r\nTen grams of milk are diluted with ten times that much water, five\r\ncubic centimeters of the copper sulfate solution added and then soda\r\nlye solution drop by drop until the copper is just precipitated. This\r\nis determined by testing a few drops of the filtrate with soda lye,\r\nwhich, when the copper is precipitated, will give neither a turbidity\r\nnor a blue color.\r\n\r\nThe mixture is poured into a dry tared filter, the precipitate washed\r\nwith hot water, dried to constant weight and weighed. The fat is\r\nremoved from the dry pulverized mass by extraction with ether and the\r\nresidue dried and weighed.\r\n\r\nThe quantity of copper oxyhydrate contained in the precipitate is\r\ncalculated from the quantity of the copper solution used and amounts\r\nto 0.2026 gram. The casein thus prepared contains not only the copper\r\ncompound named, but also some of the sodium sulfate formed on the\r\naddition of the soda lye and other mineral salts present in the milk\r\nand from which it is quite impossible to completely free it. There are\r\nalso many other objections to the process, and the product is of such a\r\nnature as to render the data obtained by the method very doubtful.\r\n\r\nThis method is chiefly valuable on account of its historical interest.\r\nNot only are the drying and weighing of the precipitate rendered\r\nunnecessary by the modern methods of determining nitrogen, but there\r\nare numerous sources of error which seem to throw doubt on the accuracy\r\nof the results. The copper hydroxid does not lose all its water even on\r\ndrying at 125°.[481] The method therefore can only be recommended for\r\npractical purposes when all the tedious processes of drying, extracting\r\nand calculating the quantity of copper oxid are abandoned and the moist\r\nwashed precipitate used directly for the determination of nitrogen.\r\n\r\n=479. Proteid Bodies by Ammonium Sulfate.=—All the proteid bodies\r\nexcept peptones are precipitated from milk on saturation with ammonium\r\nsulfate. This method has little analytical value because of the\r\npresence of nitrogenous salt in the precipitate. Zinc sulfate may be\r\nsubstituted for the ammonium salt and thus a determination of proteid\r\nmatter other than peptone be obtained. This result subtracted from the\r\ntotal proteid nitrogen gives that due to peptone.\r\n\r\n=480. Total Proteid Matter by Tannic Acid.=—For the determination\r\nof the total proteid matter in milk Sebelien uses the following\r\nprocess.[482] From three to five grams are diluted with three or four\r\nvolumes of water, a few drops of a saline solution added (sodium\r\nphosphate, sodium chlorid, magnesium sulfate, _et similia_), and the\r\nproteid bodies thrown out with an excess of tannic acid solution.\r\nThe precipitate is washed with an excess of the precipitant and the\r\nnitrogen therein determined and multiplied by 6.37.\r\n\r\n=481. Separation of Casein from Albumin.=—Sebelien prefers magnesium\r\nsulfate or sodium chlorid to acetic acid as the best reagent for\r\nseparating casein from lactalbumin. Of the two saline reagents\r\nmentioned, the former is the better. The milk is first diluted\r\nwith a double volume of the saturated saline solution and then the\r\nfine powdered salt added until saturation is secured. The casein\r\nis completely thrown out by this treatment, collected on a filter,\r\nwashed with the saturated saline solution, and the nitrogen therein\r\ndetermined. The difference between the total and casein nitrogen gives\r\nthe quantity due to the albumin plus the almost negligible quantity due\r\nto globulin.[483]\r\n\r\n=482. Van Slyke’s Method of Estimating Casein.=—The casein may be\r\nseparated from the other albuminoids in milk by the procedure proposed\r\nby Van Slyke.[484] Ten grams of the fresh milk are diluted with ninety\r\ncubic centimeters of water and the temperature raised to 40°. The\r\ncasein is thrown down with a ten per cent solution of acetic acid, of\r\nwhich about one and a half cubic centimeters are required. The mixture\r\nis well stirred and the precipitate allowed to subside. The whey is\r\ndecanted onto a filter, and the precipitate washed two or three times\r\nwith cold water, brought finally onto the filter and washed once or\r\ntwice with cold water. The filter paper and its contents are used\r\nfor the determination of nitrogen in the usual way. The casein is\r\ncalculated from the nitrogen found by multiplication by the factor\r\n6.25. Milk may be preserved for this method of determination by adding\r\nto it one part of finely powdered mercuric chlorid for each two\r\nthousand parts of the sample. The method is not applicable to curdled\r\nmilk.\r\n\r\n=483. Theory of Precipitation.=—Most authorities now agree in supposing\r\nthat the state of semisolution in which the casein is held in milk\r\nis secured by the presence of mineral matters in the milk, in some\r\nintimate combination with the casein. Among these bodies lime is of\r\nthe most importance. The action of the dilute acid is chiefly on these\r\nmineral bodies, releasing them from combination with the casein, which,\r\nbeing insoluble in the milk serum, is precipitated.\r\n\r\n=484. Factors for Calculation.=—Most analysts still use the common\r\nproteid factor, 6.25, in calculating the quantity of proteids from the\r\nnitrogen determined by analysis. For casein many different factors have\r\nbeen proposed. According to Makeris the factor varies from 6.83 to\r\n7.04.[485] Munk gives 6.34 for human and 6.37 for cow milk.[486] Sebelien\r\nadopts the latter factor, and Hammersten nearly the same; _viz._,\r\n6.39. The weight of authority, at the present time, favors a factor\r\nconsiderably above 6.25 for calculating the casein and, in fact, the\r\ntotal proteids of milk from the weight of nitrogen obtained.\r\n\r\n=485. Béchamp’s Method of Preparing Pure Casein.=—The casein in about\r\none liter of milk is precipitated by adding gradually about three\r\ngrams of glacial acetic acid diluted with water. The addition of the\r\nacid is arrested at the moment when litmus paper shows a slightly acid\r\nreaction. The precipitate thus produced, containing all the casein,\r\nthe milk globules and the microzymes, is separated by filtration,\r\nbeing washed by decantation before collecting it on the filter. On\r\nthe filter it is washed with distilled water and the fat removed by\r\nshaking with ether. The residue is suspended in water, dissolved in the\r\nleast possible quantity of ammonium carbonate, any insoluble residue\r\n(microzymes, globules) separated by filtration and the pure casein\r\nthrown out of the filtrate by the addition of acetic acid. The washing\r\nwith distilled water, solution in ammonium carbonate, filtration and\r\nreprecipitation are repeated three or four times in order to obtain\r\nthe casein entirely free of other substances. Casein thus prepared is\r\nburned to a carbon free ash with difficulty and contains but little\r\nover one-tenth per cent of mineral matter.[487]\r\n\r\n=486. Separation of Casein with Carbon Dioxid.=—The supersaturation of\r\nthe lime compounds of casein with carbon dioxid diminishes the solvent\r\naction of the lime and thus helps to throw out the proteid matter. For\r\nthis reason Hoppe-Seyler recommends the use of carbon dioxid to promote\r\nthe precipitation of the casein.[488] The milk is diluted with about\r\ntwenty volumes of water and treated, drop by drop, with very dilute\r\nacetic acid as long as a precipitate is formed. A stream of pure carbon\r\ndioxid is conducted through the mixture for half an hour, and it is\r\nallowed to remain at rest for twelve hours, when the casein will have\r\nall gone down and the supernatant liquid will be clear. Albumins and\r\npeptones are not thrown out by this treatment.\r\n\r\nThe method of precipitation is advantageously modified by saturating\r\nthe diluted milk with carbon dioxid before adding the acetic acid, less\r\nof the latter being required when used in the order just noted.[489]\r\n\r\n=487. Separation of Albumin.=—In the filtrate from the casein\r\nprecipitate the albumin may be separated by heating to 80°. It may also\r\nbe precipitated by tannic acid, in which case it may contain a little\r\nglobulin. It may also be thrown out by saturation with ammonium or\r\nzinc sulfates. The latter reagent is to be preferred when the nitrogen\r\nis to be determined in the precipitate. The quantities of albumin and\r\nglobulin, especially the latter, present in milk are small compared\r\nwith its content of casein.\r\n\r\n=488. Separation of Globulin.=—The presence of globulin in milk\r\nis demonstrated by Sebelien in the following manner:[490] The milk\r\nis saturated with finely powdered common salt and the precipitate\r\nproduced is separated by filtration. This filtrate in turn is\r\nsaturated with magnesium sulfate. The precipitate produced by this\r\nreagent is collected on a filter, dissolved in water and precipitated\r\nby saturation with sodium chlorid. This process is repeated several\r\ntimes. The final precipitate is proved to be globulin by the following\r\nreactions: When a solution of it is dialyzed the proteid body\r\nseparates as a flocculent precipitate, which is easily dissolved in\r\na weak solution of common salt. The clear solution thus obtained\r\nbecomes turbid on adding water, and more so after the addition of a\r\nlittle acetic acid. A neutral solution of the body is also completely\r\nprecipitated by saturation with sodium chlorid. These reactions serve\r\nto identify the body as a globulin and not an albumin. All the globulin\r\nin milk is not obtained by the process, since a part of it is separated\r\nwith the casein in the first precipitation.\r\n\r\n=489. Other Precipitants of Milk Proteids.=—Many other reagents besides\r\nthose mentioned have been used for precipitating milk proteids, wholly\r\nor in part. Among these may be mentioned the dilute mineral acids,\r\nlactic acid, rennet, mercuric iodid in acetic acid, phosphotungstic\r\nacid, acid mercuric nitrate, lead acetate and many others.\r\n\r\nIt has been shown by the author that many of these precipitants do not\r\nremove all the nitrogen but that among others the mercury salts are\r\neffective.[491] When nitrogen is to be subsequently determined the acid\r\nmercuric nitrate cannot be employed.\r\n\r\n=490. Precipitation by Dialysis.=—Since the casein is supposed to be\r\nheld in solution by the action of salts it is probable that it may be\r\nprecipitated by removing these salts by dialysis.\r\n\r\n=491. Carbohydrates in Milk.=—The methods of determining lactose in\r\nmilk, both by the copper reduction and optical processes, have been\r\nfully set forth in foregoing paragraphs (=243, 244, 259, 262=). In\r\ngeneral, the optical method by double dilution is to be preferred\r\nas practically exact and capable of application with the minimum\r\nconsumption of time.[492] For normal milks a single polarization is\r\nentirely sufficient, making an arbitrary correction for the volume\r\noccupied by the precipitated proteids and fat. This correction is\r\nconveniently placed at six and a half per cent of the volume of milk\r\nemployed.\r\n\r\nThe polarimetric estimation of lactose in human milk is likely to give\r\nerroneous results by reason of the existence in the serum of polarizing\r\nbodies not precipitable by the reagents commonly employed for the\r\nremoval of proteids.[493] The same statement may be made in respect of\r\nass and mare milk. The use of acetopicric acid for removing disturbing\r\nbodies, as proposed by Thibonet[494] does not insure results free from\r\nerror. With the milks above mentioned, it is safer to rely on the data\r\nobtained by the alkaline copper reagents.\r\n\r\n=492. Dextrinoid Body in Milk.=—In treating the precipitate, produced\r\nin milk by copper sulfate, with alcohol and ether for the purpose\r\nof removing the fat, Ritthausen isolated a dextrin like body quite\r\ndifferent from lactose in its properties.[495] The alcohol ether extract\r\nevaporated to dryness leaves a mass not wholly soluble in ether, and\r\ntherefore not composed of fat. This residue extracted with ether,\r\npresents flocky particles, soluble in water and mostly precipitated\r\ntherefrom by alcohol. This body has a slight reducing effect on\r\nalkaline copper salts and produces a gray color with bismuth nitrate.\r\nThe quantity of this material is so minute as to lead Ritthausen to\r\nobserve that it does not sensibly affect the fat determinations when\r\nnot separated. It is not clearly demonstrated that it is a dextrinoid\r\nbody and the analyst need not fear that the optical determination of\r\nmilk sugar will be sensibly affected thereby.\r\n\r\nRaumer and Späth assume that certain discrepancies, observed by them\r\nin the data obtained for lactose by the copper and optical methods,\r\nare due to the presence of this dextrinoid body, but no positive proof\r\nthereof is adduced.[496]\r\n\r\n=493. Amyloid Bodies in Milk.=—Herz has observed in milk a body\r\nhaving some of the characteristics of starch.[497] Observed by the\r\nmicroscope, these particles have some of the characteristics of the\r\nstarch grains of vegetables, with a diameter of from ten to thirty-five\r\nmicromillimeters. They are colored blue by iodin. When boiled with\r\nwater, however, these particles differ from starch in not forming\r\na paste. The particles are most abundant in the turbid layer found\r\nimmediately beneath the ether fat solution in the areometric process of\r\nSoxhlet.\r\n\r\nThe amyloid particles may be collected from cheese and butter by\r\nboiling with water, when they settle and can be observed on the\r\nsediment after freeing of fat by ether.\r\n\r\nSome of the statements regarding the adulteration of dairy products\r\nwith starch may have been made erroneously by reason of the natural\r\noccurrence of these particles.\r\n\r\nAs in the case of the dextrin like body mentioned above this starchy\r\nsubstance, if it really exist, occurs in too minute a quantity to\r\ninfluence the results of any of the analytical methods heretofore\r\ndescribed.\r\n\r\nIn connection with the supposed presence of an amyloid body in milk,\r\nit should be remembered that certain decomposition nitrogenous bodies\r\ngive practically the same reactions as are noted above.[498] Among these\r\nmay be mentioned chitin, which occurs very extensively in the animal\r\nworld. The proof of the existence of dextrinoid and amyloid bodies in\r\nmilk rests on evidence which should be thoroughly revised before being\r\nundoubtedly accepted.\r\n\r\n\r\nANALYSIS OF BUTTER.\r\n\r\n=494. General Principles.=—The general analysis of butter fat is\r\nconducted in accordance with the methods described in the part of this\r\nvolume devoted to the examination of fats and oils. The methods of\r\nsampling, drying, filtering, and of determining physical and chemical\r\nproperties, are there developed in sufficient detail to guide the\r\nanalyst in all operations of a general nature. There remain for\r\nconsideration here only the special processes practiced in butter\r\nanalysis and which are not applied to fats in general. These processes\r\nnaturally relate to the study of those properties of a distinctive\r\nnature, by means of which butter is differentiated from other fats for\r\nwhich it may be mistaken or with which it may be adulterated. These\r\nspecial studies, therefore, are directed chiefly to the consideration\r\nof the peculiar physical properties of butter fat, to its content of\r\nvolatile acids and to its characteristic forms of crystallization as\r\nobserved with the aid of the microscope. For dietetic, economic and\r\nlegal reasons, it is highly important that the analyst be able to\r\ndistinguish a pure butter from any substitute therefor.\r\n\r\n=495. Appearance of Melted Butter.=—Fresh, pure butter, when slowly\r\nmelted, shows after a short time the butter fat completely separated,\r\nof a delicate yellow color and quite transparent. Old samples of\r\nbutter do not give a fat layer of equal transparency. Oleomargarin,\r\nor any artificial butter when similarly treated, gives a fat layer\r\nopalescent or opaque. By means of this simple test an easy separation\r\nof pure from adulterated butter may be effected. In mixtures, the\r\ndegree of turbidity shown by the separated fats may be regarded as a\r\nrough index of the amount of adulteration. In conducting the work,\r\nthe samples of butter, in convenient quantities according to the size\r\nof the containing vessel, are placed in beakers and warmed slowly at\r\na temperature not exceeding 50°. After a lapse of half an hour the\r\nobservations are made.\r\n\r\nIf one part of the melted butter be shaken with two volumes of warm\r\nwater (40°) and set aside for five minutes the fat is still found as an\r\nemulsion, while oleomargarin, similarly treated, shows the fat mostly\r\nseparated. This process has some merit, but must not be too highly\r\nvalued.[499]\r\n\r\n=496. Microscopic Examination of Butter.=—The microscope is helpful in\r\njudging the purity of butter and the admixture of foreign fats, if not\r\nin too small quantity to be of any commercial importance, can easily\r\nbe detected by this means.[500] The methods of preparing butter fat\r\nin a crystalline state are the same as those described in paragraphs\r\n=307-309=. The crystals of butter fat differ greatly in appearance\r\nwith the different methods of preparation. When butter is melted,\r\nfiltered, heated to the boiling point of water and slowly cooled,\r\nit forms spheroidal crystalline masses as seen by the microscope,\r\nwhich present a well defined cross with polarized light. This cross\r\nis not peculiar to butter fat, but is developed therein with greater\r\ndistinctiveness than in other fats of animal origin.\r\n\r\nPure, fresh, unmelted butter, when viewed with polarized light through\r\na plate of selenite, presents a field of vision of uniform tint,\r\nvarying with the relative positions of the nicols. When foreign fats,\r\npreviously melted, as in rendering, are mixed with the butter the\r\ncrystallization they undergo disturbs this uniformity of tint and the\r\nfield of vision appears particolored. Old, rancid or melted butter may\r\ngive rise to the same or similar phenomena under like conditions of\r\nexamination. The microscope thus becomes a most valuable instrument for\r\nsorting butters and in distinguishing them in a preliminary way from\r\noleomargarin.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 112. THERMOMETER FOR BUTYROREFRACTOMETER.]\r\n\r\n=497. Judgment of Suspected Butter or Lard by Refractive Power.=—In\r\ndiscriminating between pure and adulterated butters by the aid of the\r\nbutyrorefractometer (=301=), the absolute reading of the instrument is\r\nof less importance than the difference which is detected between the\r\nhighest permissible numbers, for any degree of temperature, and the\r\nactual reading obtained at that temperature. These differences, within\r\ncertain limits, do not perceptibly vary with the temperature, and\r\nheretofore they have been determined with the aid of a table, and in\r\nthis respect the observations have been made the more laborious.\r\n\r\nWollny has rendered these tables unnecessary by constructing a\r\nthermometer in which the mercury column does not indicate degrees of\r\ntemperature, but the highest permissible number for butter or lard\r\nat the temperature of observation. The scale of the instrument is so\r\nadjusted as to include temperatures of from 30° to 40°, which renders\r\nit suited to the examination of butter and lard. The oleothermometer is\r\nshown in Fig. 112.\r\n\r\nThe side of the scale _B_ is for butter and that marked _S_ for lard.\r\nThe use of the instrument is the simplest possible. The sample of fat\r\nis placed in the prisms in the usual manner. When the mercury in the\r\nthermometer is at rest, the scale of the instrument is read. In the\r\ncase of a butter, if the reading of the scale give a higher number than\r\nthat indicated by the thermometer, the sample is pronounced suspicious\r\nand the degree of suspicion is proportional to the difference of the\r\ntwo readings.\r\n\r\n=498. Estimation of Water, Fat, Casein, Ash and Salt.=—The methods\r\nproposed by the author for conducting these determinations, with\r\nminor amendments, have been adopted by the Association of Official\r\nAgricultural Chemists.[501]\r\n\r\n_Water._—The sample held in a flat bottom dish is dried to constant\r\nweight at about 100°. The weight of the sample used should be\r\nproportional to the area of the bottom of the dish, which should be\r\njust covered by the film of melted fat. The dish may be previously\r\npartly filled with sand, asbestos or pumice stone. The drying may take\r\nplace in the air, in an inert gas or in a vacuum.\r\n\r\n_Fat._—The fat in a sample of butter is readily determined by treating\r\nthe contents of the dish after the determination of water with an\r\nappropriate solvent.\r\n\r\nThe process is conducted as follows:\r\n\r\nThe dry butter from the water determination is dissolved in the dish\r\nwith ether or petroleum spirit. The contents of the dish are then\r\ntransferred to a weighed gooch with the aid of a wash bottle containing\r\nthe solvent, and washed till free of fat. The crucible and contents are\r\nheated at the temperature of boiling water till the weight is constant.\r\nThe weight of fat is calculated by difference from the data obtained.\r\n\r\nThe fat may also be determined by drying the butter on asbestos or\r\nsand, and subsequently extracting the fat by anhydrous alcohol free\r\nether. The extract, after evaporation of the ether, is dried to\r\nconstant weight at the temperature of boiling water and weighed.\r\n\r\n_Casein or Curd and Ash._—The crucible containing the residue from the\r\nfat determination is covered and heated, gently at first, gradually\r\nraising the temperature to just below redness. The cover may then be\r\nremoved and the heat continued till the contents of the crucible are\r\nwhite. The loss in weight of the crucible and contents represents\r\ncasein or curd, and the residue is mineral matter or ash.\r\n\r\n_Salt._—It is the usual custom in the manufacture of butter in this\r\ncountry to add, as a condiment, a certain proportion of salt. In\r\nEurope, the butter offered for consumption is usually unsalted. A\r\nconvenient method of determining the quantity of salt is found in the\r\nremoval thereof, from the sample, by repeated washing with hot water\r\nand in determining the salt in the wash water by precipitation with\r\nsilver nitrate. The operation is conducted as follows: From five to\r\nten grams of the sample are placed in a separatory funnel, hot water\r\nadded, the stopper inserted and the contents of the funnel well shaken.\r\nAfter standing until the fat has all collected on top of the water, the\r\nstopcock is opened and the water is allowed to run into an erlenmeyer,\r\nbeing careful to let none of the fat globules pass. Hot water is again\r\nadded to the beaker, and the extraction is repeated several times,\r\nusing each time from ten to twenty cubic centimeters of water. The\r\nresulting washings contain all but a mere trace of the sodium chlorid\r\noriginally present in the butter. The sodium chlorid is determined in\r\nthe filtrate by a set solution of silver nitrate, using a few drops of\r\na solution of potassium chromate as an indicator.\r\n\r\nIt is evident that the quantity of salt may also be determined from the\r\nash or mineral matter obtained, as above noted, by the same process.\r\nIf desirable, which is rarely the case, the gravimetric method of\r\nestimating the silver chlorid may be used.\r\n\r\n=499. Volatile or Soluble Acids.=—The distinguishing feature of butter,\r\nfrom a chemical point of view, is found in its content of volatile or\r\nsoluble fat acids. Among the volatile acids are reckoned those which\r\nare carried over in a current of steam at a temperature only slightly\r\nhigher than that of boiling water. As soluble acids are regarded\r\nthose which pass without great difficulty into solution in hot water.\r\nThese two classes are composed essentially of the same acids. Of these\r\nbutyric is the most important, followed by caproic, caprylic and capric\r\nacids. Small quantities or rather traces of acetic, lauric, myristic\r\nand arachidic acids are also sometimes found in butter. Palmitic,\r\nstearic and oleic acids also occur in large quantities. The above named\r\nacids, in combination with glycerol, form the butter fat.\r\n\r\n=500. Relative Proportion of Ingredients.=—The composition of butter\r\nfat is given differently by different authorities.[502] A typical dry\r\nbutter fat may be regarded as having the following composition:\r\n\r\n                                  Per cent.\r\n    Butyrin                          7.00\r\n    Caproin, Caprylin and Caprin     2.30\r\n    Olein                           37.70\r\n    Palmitin, stearin, etc.          53.00\r\n\r\nPure butter fat consists principally of the above glycerids, some\r\ncoloring principles, varying in quantity and composition with the food\r\nof the animal, and a trace of lecithin, cholesterol, phytosterol and a\r\nlipochrome.\r\n\r\n=501. Estimation of Volatile or Soluble Acids.=—The volatile or soluble\r\nacids in butter fat are estimated by the methods already described\r\n(=349, 351=). In practice preference is given to the method of\r\ndetermining volatile acids, based on the principle that under standard\r\nconditions practically all the acids of this nature are secured in a\r\ncertain volume of the distillate. This assumption is not strictly true,\r\nbut the method offers a convenient and reliable manner of obtaining\r\nresults which, if not absolute, are at least comparative.\r\n\r\nThe quantity of acid distilled is determined by titration with tenth\r\nnormal alkali and for convenience the data are expressed in terms of\r\nthe volume of the alkali consumed. Five grams of normal butter fat\r\nwill give a distillate, under the conditions given, requiring about\r\ntwenty-eight cubic centimeters of tenth normal alkali for complete\r\nsaturation. This is known as the reichert-meissl number. Occasionally\r\nthis number may rise to thirty-two or may sink to twenty-five. Cases\r\nhave been reported where it fell below the latter number, but such\r\nsamples cannot be regarded as normal butter.\r\n\r\nThe determination of the reichert-meissl number is the most important\r\nof the chemical processes applied to butter fat analysis.\r\n\r\n=502. Saponification Value and Reichert Number.=—It may often be\r\nconvenient to make the same sample of butter fat serve both for the\r\ndetermination of the saponification value and of the reichert number.\r\nFor this purpose it is convenient to use exactly five grams of the\r\ndry filtered fat. The saponification may be accomplished either under\r\npressure or by attaching a reflux condenser to the flask as suggested\r\nby Bremer.[503] When the saponification, which is accomplished with\r\nalcoholic potash lye containing about 1.25 grams in each ten cubic\r\ncentimeters of seventy per cent alcohol, is finished, and the contents\r\nof the flask are cooled, the residual alkali is titrated with a set\r\nsulfuric acid solution, using phenolphthalein as indicator. When the\r\ncolor has almost disappeared, an additional quantity of the indicator\r\nis added and the titration continued until the liquid is of an amber\r\ntint. A sample of the alkali, treated as above, is titrated at the same\r\ntime and from the two sets of data obtained, the saponification number\r\nis calculated as indicated in paragraph (=345=).\r\n\r\nA few drops of the alcoholic lye are added to the contents of the flask\r\nand the alcohol removed by evaporation. The residual soap and potassium\r\nsulfate are dissolved in 100 cubic centimeters of recently boiled\r\nwater, some pieces of pumice added, and the volatile acids removed by\r\ndistillation in the usual way after adding an excess of sulfuric acid.\r\nIt is important to conduct blank distillations in the same form of\r\napparatus to determine the magnitude of any corrections to be made.\r\nThe size of the distilling flask and the form of apparatus to prevent\r\nmechanical projection of sulfuric acid into the distillate should be\r\nthe same in all cases.\r\n\r\n=503. Modification of the Reichert-Meissl Method.=—Kreis has proposed\r\nthe use of strong sulfuric acid for saponifying the fats, the\r\nsaponification and distillation being accomplished in one operation.\r\nA source of error of some inconvenience in this method is due to the\r\ndevelopment of sulfurous acid by the reducing action of the organic\r\nmatter on the oil of vitriol. Pinette proposes to avoid this difficulty\r\nby adding, before the distillation is begun, sufficient potassium\r\npermanganate to produce a permanent red coloration. By this means the\r\nsulfurous acid is completely oxidized and its transfer to the standard\r\nalkali during distillation entirely prevented. The same result is\r\naccomplished by Micko by the use of potassium bichromate. The details\r\nof the manipulation are as follows:[504]\r\n\r\nAbout five grams of the fused fat (butter or oleomargarin) are placed\r\nin a flask of approximately 300 cubic centimeters capacity. After\r\ncooling, there are added ten cubic centimeters of sulfuric acid\r\ncontaining three grams of water to each ninety-seven grams of the\r\nstrongest acid.\r\n\r\nThe fat and acid are well mixed by a gentle rotatory motion of the\r\nflask and placed in a water bath at a temperature of 35° (_circa_) for\r\nfifteen minutes. At the end of this time the flask is removed from\r\nthe bath and 125 cubic centimeters of water added, little by little,\r\nkeeping the contents cool. Next are added four cubic centimeters of a\r\nfour per cent solution of potassium bichromate. The contents of the\r\nflask are vigorously shaken and, after five minutes, a solution of\r\nferrous sulfate is added gradually from a burette until the reaction\r\nwith a drop of potassium ferrocyanid shows a slight excess of the iron\r\nsalt. The volume of the liquor in the flask is then increased to 150\r\ncubic centimeters by the addition of water and 110 cubic centimeters\r\ndistilled. After mixing and filtering through a dry filter, the acid\r\nin 100 cubic centimeters is determined by standard tenth normal barium\r\nhydroxid solution and the number thus obtained increased by one-tenth\r\nrepresenting the total acid obtained.\r\n\r\n=504. Elimination of Sulfurous Acid.=—Prager and Stern[505] propose to\r\neliminate the sulfurous acid by a stream of air, succeeded by one of\r\ncarbon dioxid, and proceed as follows: Five grams of the butter fat are\r\nbrought into a liter flask, ten cubic centimeters of strong sulfuric\r\nacid are added and the flask is kept for ten minutes at 30-32° with\r\nconstant agitation. When the liquid is cold, air is bubbled through\r\nit until the odor of sulfurous acid has disappeared. One hundred\r\ncubic centimeters of water are added, with precautions against rise\r\nof temperature, and carbon dioxid is bubbled through for ten minutes.\r\nThis is then displaced by a stream of air for another ten minutes, the\r\ndelivery tube is washed into the flask with fifty cubic centimeters\r\nof water and the distillation is effected. The following results are\r\nquoted:\r\n\r\nCubic centimeters of tenth normal alkali required by five grams of\r\nbutter fat:\r\n\r\n                Reichert-Meissl.  Prager-Stern.\r\n    Sample _a_       29.86           29.60\r\n      ”    _b_       30.23           29.65\r\n      ”    _c_       28.34           27.76\r\n      ”    _d_       28.20           28.10\r\n\r\nThe authors do not comment on the possibility of loss of acids\r\nother than sulfurous in the stream of air, but they admit that\r\nfurther investigation is requisite to render the suggestion of Kreis\r\nserviceable.\r\n\r\n=505. Errors Due to Poor Glass.=—The easy solubility of the glass\r\nholding the reagents is the cause of some of the difficulties attending\r\nthe determination of the saponification value. The separated silica\r\ntends to carry down, mechanically, a part of the alkali. This is shown\r\nby the fact that after the color has been discharged by titration\r\nwith acid and the flask set aside a reappearance of the red color is\r\nnoticed, after a time, beginning at the bottom of the flask.[506] In\r\norder to avoid difficulties of this nature, either cold saponification\r\nshould be practiced or the digestion vessels used for moist combustion\r\nin sulfuric acid be employed.\r\n\r\nErrors may also be easily introduced by the use of uncalibrated\r\nburettes and from the employment of varying quantities of the\r\nphenolphthalein solution.\r\n\r\n=506. Estimation of the Molecular Weight of Butter and Butter\r\nSubstitutes.=—Garelli and Carono have proposed a method for\r\ndiscriminating between butter and its substitutes by the kryoskopic\r\ndetermination of molecular weights.\r\n\r\nThe molecular weights of stearin, palmitin and olein are 890, 806\r\nand 884, and of butyrin, caproin and caprylin 303, 386 and 470\r\nrespectively. Pure butter, therefore, has a lower mean molecular weight\r\nthan margarin.\r\n\r\nThe method and apparatus of Beckmann are used in the determination,\r\nfifteen grams of benzol being employed as a solvent.\r\n\r\nThe constant for the molecular depression of the benzol is found to be\r\n53.\r\n\r\nThe molecular weight obtained with samples of pure butter varied from\r\n696 to 716, and for oleomargarin from 780 to 883.\r\n\r\nThe figures obtained with mixtures of twenty, twenty-five, thirty-three\r\nand fifty per cent of margarin with butter were 761, 720, 728 and 749\r\nrespectively. The method can be relied upon to classify samples as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n1. Pure butter.\r\n\r\n2. Butter containing margarin.\r\n\r\n3. Suspicious butter.[507]\r\n\r\n=507. Substitutes and Adulterants of Butter.=—In this country, butter\r\nis never adulterated with cocoa or sesame oil, as is sometimes the case\r\nin other lands. The common substitute for butter here is oleomargarin,\r\nand the most common butter adulterant, neutral lard. The methods of\r\nanalyses, by means of which these bodies can be identified, have\r\nalready been sufficiently described. By the use of certain digestive\r\nferments and other bodies, butter may be made to hold an excessive\r\nquantity of casein, sugar and water in the form of a somewhat permanent\r\nemulsion.[508] This form of adulteration is revealed at once on melting\r\nthe sample.\r\n\r\n=508. Furfurol Reaction with Sesame Oil.=—Olive oil and sometimes\r\nbutter are mixed with the cheaper body, sesame oil. The latter is\r\ndetected with certainty, from the red coloration it gives when mixed\r\nwith furfurol and hydrochloric acid. Instead of furfurol, some body\r\nyielding it when subjected to the action of hydrochloric acid, _viz._,\r\nsucrose or a pentose sugar, may be used. It has been found by Wauters,\r\nhowever, that an alcoholic solution of two grams of furfuraldehyd in\r\n100 cubic centimeters of alcohol is the best reagent. One-tenth of a\r\ncubic centimeter of this reagent is used for each test.[509]\r\n\r\nThe test is made as follows: The quantity of the furfuraldehyd solution\r\nmentioned above is mixed with ten cubic centimeters of hydrochloric\r\nacid, and there are added, without mixing, an equal volume of the\r\nsuspected oil. On standing, a red coloration is produced at the zone of\r\nseparation of the two liquids. If the oil be sesame, the coloration is\r\nproduced instantly. As little as one per cent of sesame in a mixed oil\r\nwill show the color in two minutes. The manipulation is also varied by\r\nshaking together the reagents and the melted butter. Turmeric, which\r\nis sometimes used in coloring butter, also gives the rose-red color\r\nwhen treated with hydrochloric acid, but turmeric supplies its own\r\nfurfuraldehyd. It is easy to distinguish therefore the coloration due\r\nto sesame oil, which is developed only when furfuraldehyd is present,\r\nfrom that due to the turmeric, which is produced without the aid of the\r\nspecial reagent.\r\n\r\n=509. Butter Colors.=—Where cows are deprived of green food and root\r\ncrops, such as carrots, and kept on a poorly balanced ration, the\r\nbutter made from their milk may be almost colorless. To remedy this\r\ndefect it is quite a common practice to color the product artificially.\r\nAlmost the sole coloring matter used in this country is anatto.[510]\r\nOther coloring matters which are occasionally employed are turmeric,\r\nsaffron, marigold leaves, yellow wood (_Chlorophora tinctoria_), carrot\r\njuice, chrome yellow (lead chromate) and dinitrocresol.\r\n\r\nThe use of small quantities of anatto, turmeric or saffron is\r\nunobjectionable, from a sanitary point of view, but this is not the\r\ncase with such a substance as lead chromate. The detection of anatto or\r\nsaffron in butter may be accomplished by the method of Cornwall.[511]\r\nAbout five grams of the warm filtered fat are dissolved in about fifty\r\ncubic centimeters of ordinary ether, in a wide tube, and the solution\r\nis vigorously shaken for from ten to fifteen seconds, with from twelve\r\nto fifteen cubic centimeters of a very dilute solution of caustic\r\npotash or soda in water, only alkaline enough to give a distinct\r\nreaction with turmeric paper, and to remain alkaline after separating\r\nfrom the ethereal fat solution. The corked tube is set aside, and in\r\na few hours, at most, the greater part of the aqueous solution, now\r\ncolored more or less yellow by the anatto, can be drawn from beneath\r\nthe ether with a pipette or by a stopcock below, in a sufficiently\r\nclear state to be evaporated to dryness and tested in the usual way\r\nwith a drop of concentrated sulfuric acid.\r\n\r\nSometimes it is well to further purify the aqueous solution by shaking\r\nit with some fresh ether before evaporating it, and any fat globules\r\nthat may float on its surface during evaporation should be removed by\r\ntouching them with a slip of filter paper; but the solution should not\r\nbe filtered, because the filter paper may retain much of the coloring\r\nmatter.\r\n\r\nThe dry yellow or slightly orange residue turns blue or violet blue\r\nwith sulfuric acid, then quickly green, and finally brownish or\r\nsomewhat violet this final change being variable, according to the\r\npurity of the extract.\r\n\r\nSaffron can be extracted in the same way; it differs from anatto very\r\ndecidedly, the most important difference being in the absence of the\r\ngreen coloration.\r\n\r\nGenuine butter, free from foreign coloring matter, imparts at most a\r\nvery pale yellow color to the alkaline solution; but it is important\r\nto note that a mere green coloration of the dry residue on addition\r\nof sulfuric acid is not a certain indication of anatto (as some books\r\nstate) because the writer has thus obtained from genuine butter,\r\nfree from foreign coloring matter, a dirty green coloration, but not\r\npreceded by any blue or violet-blue tint.\r\n\r\nBlank tests should be made with the ether.\r\n\r\nTurmeric is easily identified by the brownish to reddish stratum that\r\nforms between the ethereal fat solution and the alkaline solution\r\nbefore they are intimately mixed. It may be even better recognized by\r\ncarefully bringing a feebly alkaline solution of ammonia in alcohol\r\nbeneath the ethereal fat solution with a pipette, and gently agitating\r\nthe two, so as to mix them partially.\r\n\r\nAnother method of separating artificial coloring matter has been\r\nproposed by Martin.[512]\r\n\r\nA method of determining the relative amount of butter color has been\r\nworked out by Babcock.[513]\r\n\r\n\r\nEXAMINATION OF CHEESE.\r\n\r\n=510. Composition Of Cheese.=—Pure cheese is made from whole milk by\r\nprecipitating the casein with rennet. The precipitated casein carries\r\ndown also the fat of the milk and a little lactose and whey remain\r\nincorporated with the cheesy mass. The ingredients of cheese are\r\ntherefore those of the whole milk less the greater part of the whey,\r\n_id est_, milk sugar, lactalbumin, globulin, soluble mineral matters\r\nand water. In the conversion of the crude precipitate noted above into\r\nthe cheese of commerce, it is subjected to a ripening process which is\r\nchiefly conditioned by bacterial action. It is not possible here to\r\nenter into a discussion of methods of isolating and identifying the\r\nbacteria which promote or retard the ripening process.[514] As a rule,\r\nabout a month is required for the curing process, before the cheeses\r\nare ready for boxing and shipment. The most important changes during\r\nripening take place in the proteid matter, which is so altered as to\r\nbecome more palatable and more digestible as a result of the bacterial\r\nactivity.\r\n\r\nThe percentage composition of the principal cheeses of commerce are\r\nshown in the following table:[515]\r\n\r\n                  Water,     Casein,     Fat,      Sugar,     Ash,\r\n                 Per cent.

A good American green cheese made from milk of\r\nthe composition noted below will have the composition which is\r\nappended.[516]\r\n\r\n        TABLE SHOWING MEAN COMPOSITION OF\r\n            MILK AND CHEESE MADE THEREFROM.\r\n                               Milk.

This is a point of\r\nsome importance in judging the purity of a cheese. When the full milk\r\nof a mixed herd is used the percentage of fat in a cheese will always\r\nbe considerably higher than that of casein.\r\n\r\n=511. Manipulation of the Milk.=—When sweet milk is received at the\r\ncheese factory, a starter of sour milk is added to it in order to\r\nhasten its ripening. When it is thought that the proper degree of\r\nacidity has been secured, it is subjected to a rennet test. In this\r\ntest 160 cubic centimeters of the milk are heated to 30° and mixed\r\nwith five cubic centimeters of the rennet solution made by diluting\r\nfive cubic centimeters of the rennet of commerce with fifty cubic\r\ncentimeters of water. The number of seconds required for the milk\r\nto curdle is noted. The observation is facilitated by distributing\r\nthroughout the milk a few fine fragments of charcoal. The contents of\r\nthe vessel are given a circular motion and, at the moment of setting,\r\nthe movement of the black particles is suddenly arrested. If coloring\r\nmatter be added to the milk, it should be done before it becomes sour.\r\nThe quantity of rennet required is determined by the nature of the\r\ncheese which it is desired to make. For a cheese to be rapidly cured,\r\nenough rennet should be added to produce coagulation in from fifteen\r\nto twenty minutes, and when slow curing is practiced in from thirty\r\nto forty-five minutes. When the mass is solid so that it can be cut\r\nwith a knife, the temperature is raised to 37°, and it is tested on a\r\nhot iron until it forms threads an eighth of an inch in length. This\r\ntest is made by applying an iron heated nearly to redness to the curd.\r\nWhen the curd is in proper condition threads from a few millimeters to\r\ntwo centimeters in length are formed, when the iron is withdrawn. The\r\nlonger threads indicate, but only to a limited extent, a higher degree\r\nof acidity.[517] This test is usually made about two and one-half hours\r\nfrom the time of coagulation. The whey is then drawn off through a\r\nstrainer and the curd is placed on racks with linen bottoms in order\r\nthat the residual whey may escape, the curd being stirred meanwhile.\r\nIn from fifteen to twenty minutes it can be cut into blocks eight or\r\nten inches square and turned over. This is repeated several times in\r\norder to facilitate the escape of the whey. When the curd assumes a\r\nstringy condition, it is run through a mill and cut into small bits and\r\nis ready for salting, being cooled to 27° before the salt is added.\r\nFrom two to three pounds of salt are used for each 100 pounds of curd.\r\nThe curd is then placed in the molds and pressed into the desired\r\nform. The cheeses thus prepared are placed on shelves in the ripening\r\nroom and the rinds greased. They should be turned and rubbed every day\r\nduring the ripening, which takes place at a temperature of from 15° to\r\n18°.[518]\r\n\r\n=512. Official Methods of Analysis.=—The methods of cheese analysis\r\nrecommended by the Association of Official Agricultural Chemists\r\nare provisional and are not binding on its members. They are as\r\nfollows:[519]\r\n\r\n_Preparation of Sample._—Where the cheese can be cut, a narrow wedge\r\nreaching from the edge to the center will more nearly represent the\r\naverage composition than any other sample. This should be chopped quite\r\nfine, with care to avoid evaporation of water, and the several portions\r\nfor analysis taken from the mixed mass. When the sample is obtained\r\nwith a cheese trier, a plug perpendicular to the surface one-third of\r\nthe distance from the edge to the center of the cheese more nearly\r\nrepresents the average composition than any other. The plug should\r\neither reach entirely or half way through the cheese. For inspection\r\npurposes the rind may be rejected, but for investigations where the\r\nabsolute quantity of fat in the cheese is required the rind should be\r\nincluded in the sample. It is well, when admissible, to secure two or\r\nthree plugs on different sides of the cheese, and, after splitting them\r\nlengthwise with a sharp knife, use portions of each for the different\r\ndeterminations.\r\n\r\n_Determination of Water._—From five to ten grams of cheese are placed\r\nin thin slices in a weighed platinum or porcelain dish which contains\r\na small quantity of freshly ignited asbestos to absorb the fat. The\r\ndish is heated in a water oven for ten hours and weighed; the loss in\r\nweight is considered as water. If preferred, the dish may be placed in\r\na desiccator over concentrated sulfuric acid and dried to constant\r\nweight. In some cases this may require as much as two months. The acid\r\nshould be renewed when the cheese has become nearly dry.\r\n\r\n_Determination of Ether Extract._—Grind from five to ten grams of\r\ncheese in a small mortar with about twice its weight of anhydrous\r\ncopper sulfate. The grinding should continue until the cheese is finely\r\npulverized and evenly distributed throughout the mass, which will have\r\na uniform light blue color. This mixture is transferred to a glass tube\r\nhaving a strong filter paper, supported by a piece of muslin, tied over\r\none end. Put a little anhydrous copper sulfate into the tube next to\r\nthe filter before introducing the mixture containing the cheese. On top\r\nof the mixture place a tuft of ignited asbestos, and place the tube in\r\na continuous extraction apparatus and treat with anhydrous ether for\r\nfifteen hours. Dry the fat obtained at 100° to constant weight.\r\n\r\n_Determination of Nitrogen._—The nitrogen is determined by the kjeldahl\r\nmethod, using about two grams of cheese, and multiplying the percentage\r\nof nitrogen found by 6.25 for proteid compounds.\r\n\r\n_Determination of Ash._—The dry residue from the water determination\r\nmay be used for the ash determination. If the cheese be rich in fat,\r\nthe asbestos will be saturated therewith. This may be carefully ignited\r\nand the fat allowed to burn, the asbestos acting as a wick. No extra\r\nheat should be applied during this operation, as there is danger of\r\nspurting. When the flame has died out, the burning may be completed in\r\na muffle at low redness. When desired, the salt may be determined in\r\nthe ash in the manner specified under butter (=498=).\r\n\r\n_Determination of Other Constituents._—The sum of the percentages of\r\nthe different constituents, determined as above, subtracted from 100\r\nwill give the amount of organic acids, milk sugar etc., in the cheese.\r\n\r\n=513. Process of Mueller.=—The process of Müller,[520] as modified by\r\nKruger,[521] is conducted as follows: About ten grams of a good average\r\nsample of cheese are rubbed in a porcelain mortar with a mixture of\r\nthree parts of alcohol and one part of ether. After the mixed liquids\r\nhave been in contact with the cheese five or ten minutes they are\r\npoured upon a weighed filter of from fifteen to sixteen centimeters\r\ndiameter, and this process is repeated from one to three times, after\r\nwhich the contents of the mortar are brought upon the filter. The\r\nfiltrate is received in a weighed flask, the alcohol ether driven off\r\nby evaporation and the residue dried. Since it is difficult to get\r\nall the particles of cheese free from the mortar, it is advisable to\r\nperform the above process in a weighed dish which can afterwards be\r\nwashed thoroughly with ether and alcohol and dried and the amount of\r\nmatter remaining thereon accounted for. The residue remaining in the\r\nflask after drying is treated several times with pure warm ether,\r\nand the residue also remaining upon the filter mentioned above is\r\ncompletely extracted with ether. The dried residue obtained in this\r\nway from the filter plus the residue in the flask which received the\r\nfiltrate, plus the amount left upon the dish in which the cheese was\r\noriginally rubbed up, constitute the total dry matter of the cheese\r\nfreed of fat. All the material soluble in ether should be collected\r\ntogether, dried and weighed as fat.\r\n\r\nBy this process the cheesy mass is converted into a fine powder which\r\ncan be easily and completely freed from fat by ether, and can be dried\r\nwithout becoming a gummy or horny mass.\r\n\r\nFor the estimation of the nitrogen, about three grams of the well\r\ngrated cheese are used and the nitrogen determined by moist combustion\r\nwith sulfuric acid.[522]\r\n\r\nFor the estimation of ash, about five grams are carbonized, extracted\r\nwith water, and the ash determined as described below.[523]\r\n\r\nChar from two to three grams of the substance and burn to whiteness\r\nat the lowest possible red heat. If a white ash cannot be obtained in\r\nthis manner, exhaust the charred mass with water, collect the insoluble\r\nresidue on a filter, burn, add this ash to the residue from the\r\nevaporation of the aqueous extract and heat the whole to a low redness\r\ntill the ash is white.\r\n\r\n=514. Separation of Fat from Cheese.=—It is often desirable to secure\r\na considerable quantity of the cheese fat for physical and chemical\r\nexamination without the necessity of effecting a complete quantitive\r\nseparation. In this laboratory this is accomplished by the method of\r\nHenzold.[524] The cheese, in quantities of about 300 grams, is cut\r\ninto fragments about the size of a pea and treated with 700 cubic\r\ncentimeters of potash lye, which has previously been brought to a\r\ntemperature of about 20°. The strength of the lye should be such that\r\nabout fifty grams of the caustic potash are contained in each liter of\r\nthe solution.\r\n\r\nThe treatment is conveniently conducted in a wide neck flask and the\r\nsolution of the casein is promoted by vigorous shaking. After from five\r\nto ten minutes, it will be found that the casein is dissolved and the\r\nfat is found swimming upon the surface of the solution in the form of\r\nlumps. The lumps of fat are collected in as large a mass as possible by\r\na gentle shaking to and fro. Cold water is poured into the flask until\r\nthe fat is driven up into the neck, whence it is removed by means of a\r\nspoon.\r\n\r\nThe fat obtained in this way is washed a few times with as little cold\r\nwater as possible in order to remove the residue of potash lye which\r\nit may contain. Experience shows that the fat by this treatment is\r\nnot perceptibly attacked by the potash lye. In a short time, by this\r\nprocedure, the fat is practically all separated and is then easily\r\nprepared for chemical analysis by filtering and drying in the manner\r\nalready described (=283=). The fat may also be separated, but with less\r\nconvenience, by partially drying the sample, reducing it to a finely\r\ndivided state and applying any of the usual solvents. The solvent\r\nis removed from the extract by evaporation and the residual fat is\r\nfiltered and prepared for examination as usual.\r\n\r\n=515. Filled Cheese.=—The skim milk coming from the separators is\r\nunfortunately too often used for cheese making. The abstracted fat\r\nis replaced with a cheaper one, usually lard. These spurious cheeses\r\nare found in nearly every market and are generally sold as genuine.\r\nThe purchasers only discover the fraud when the cheese is consumed.\r\nMany of the States have forbidden by statute the manufacture and sale\r\nof this fraudulent article. Imported cheeses may also be regarded\r\nwith suspicion, inasmuch as the method of preparing filled cheese is\r\nwell known and extensively practiced abroad. A mere determination of\r\nthe percentage of fat in the sample is not an index of the purity of\r\nthe cheese. It is necessary to extract the fat by one of the methods\r\nalready described and, after drying and filtering, to submit the\r\nsuspected fat to a microscopic and chemical examination. A low content\r\nof volatile fat acid and the occurrence of crystalline forms foreign to\r\nbutter will furnish the data for a competent judgment.\r\n\r\nWhen the reichert-meissl number falls below twenty-five the sample\r\nmay be regarded with suspicion. The detection of the characteristic\r\ncrystals of lard or tallow is reliable corroborating evidence (=308=).\r\n\r\nIt is stated by Kühn[525] that the margarin factory of Mohr, at\r\nBahrenfeld-Altona, has made for many years a perfect emulsion of fat\r\nwith skim milk. This product has been much used in the manufacture of\r\nfilled cheese which is often found upon the German market.\r\n\r\n=516. Separation of the Nitrogenous Bodies in Cheese.=—The general\r\nmethods of separation already described for proteid bodies (=417-425=)\r\nare also applicable to the different nitrogenous bodies present\r\nin cheese, representing the residue of these bodies as originally\r\noccurring in the milk, and also the products which are formed therefrom\r\nduring the period of ripening. For practical dietary and analytical\r\npurposes, these bodies may be considered in three groups:\r\n\r\n(_a_) The useless (from a nutrient point of view) nitrogenous bodies,\r\nincluding ammonia, nitric acid, the phenylamido-propionic acids,\r\ntyrosin, leucin and other amid bodies.\r\n\r\n(_b_) The albumoses and peptones, products of fermentation soluble in\r\nboiling water.\r\n\r\n(_c_) The caseins and albuminates, insoluble in boiling water.\r\n\r\nThe group of bodies under (_a_), according to Stutzer, may be separated\r\nfrom the groups (_b_) and (_c_) by means of phosphotungstic acid. For\r\nthis purpose a portion of an intimate mixture of fine sand and cheese\r\n(100 cheese, 400 sand) corresponding to five grams of cheese, is\r\nshaken for fifteen minutes with 150 cubic centimeters of water. After\r\nremaining at rest for another fifteen minutes 100 cubic centimeters of\r\ndilute sulfuric acid (one acid, three water) are added, followed by\r\ntreatment with the phosphotungstic acid as long as any precipitate is\r\nproduced. The mixture is thrown on a filter and the insoluble matters\r\nwashed with dilute sulfuric acid until the filtrate amounts to half\r\na liter. Of this quantity an aliquot part (200 cubic centimeters) is\r\nused for the determination of nitrogen. From the quantity of nitrogen\r\nfound, that representing the ammonia, as determined in a separate\r\nportion, is deducted and the remainder represents the nitrogen present\r\nin the cheese as amids.[526]\r\n\r\n_Albumoses and Peptones._—Albumoses and peptones are determined in\r\ncheese by the following method:[527] A quantity of the sand mixture\r\nalready described, corresponding to five grams of the cheese, is\r\ntreated with about 100 cubic centimeters of water, heated to boiling,\r\nand the clear liquid above the sand poured into a flask of half a liter\r\ncapacity. The extraction is continued with successive portions of water\r\nin like manner until the volume of the extract is nearly half a liter.\r\nWhen cold, the volume of the extract is completed to half a liter with\r\nwater, the liquor filtered, 200 cubic centimeters of the filtrate\r\ntreated with an equal volume of dilute sulfuric acid (one to three) and\r\nphosphotungstic acid added until no further precipitate takes place.\r\nThe nitrogen is determined in the precipitate after filtration and\r\nwashing with dilute sulfuric acid.\r\n\r\n_Casein and Albuminates._—The quantity of casein and albuminates in\r\ncheese is calculated by subtracting from the total nitrogen that\r\ncorresponding to ammonia, amids, that in the indigestible residue\r\nand that corresponding to the albumose and peptone. In three samples\r\nof cheese, _viz._, camembert, swiss, and gervais, Stutzer found the\r\nnitrogen, determined as above, distributed as follows:[528]\r\n\r\n                              Camembert.  Swiss.  Gervais.\r\n    N as ammonia                 13.0      3.7       1.6\r\n    N as amids                   38.5      9.0       5.2\r\n    N as albumose peptone        30.5      8.6      15.5\r\n    N indigestible                4.0      2.4       8.6\r\n    N as casein, albuminates     14.0     76.3      69.1\r\n\r\n_Ammoniacal Nitrogen._—The ammoniacal nitrogen is determined by mixing\r\na quantity of the sand-cheese corresponding to five grams of cheese,\r\nwith 200 cubic centimeters of water, adding an excess of barium\r\ncarbonate and collecting the ammonia by distillation in the usual way.\r\n\r\n_Digestible Proteids._—The digestible proteids in cheese are determined\r\nby the process of artificial digestion, which will be described in the\r\npart of this volume treating of the nutritive value of foods.\r\n\r\nThese data show the remarkable changes which the proteids undergo where\r\nthe ripening is carried very far as in the camembert cheese.\r\n\r\n=517. Koumiss.=—Fermented mare milk has long been a favorite beverage\r\nin the East, where it is known as koumiss. In Europe and this country\r\ncow milk is employed in the manufacture of fermented milk, although it\r\nis less rich in lactose than mare milk. The process of manufacture is\r\nsimple, provided a suitable starter is at hand. A portion of a previous\r\nbrewing is the most convenient one, the fermentation being promoted by\r\nthe addition of a little yeast. After the process of fermentation is\r\nfinished the koumiss is placed in bottles and preserved in a horizontal\r\nposition in a cellar, where the temperature is not allowed to rise\r\nabove 12°.\r\n\r\n=518. Determination of Carbon Dioxid.=—The carbon dioxid in koumiss is\r\nconveniently estimated by connecting the bottle by means of a champagne\r\ntap with a system of absorption bulbs.[529] The exit tube from the\r\nkoumiss bottle passes first into an erlenmeyer, which serves to break\r\nand retain any bubbles that pass over. The water is next removed by\r\nmeans of sulfuric acid. The koumiss bottle is placed in a bath of water\r\nwhich is raised to the boiling point as the evolution of the gas is\r\naccomplished. The arrangement of the apparatus is shown in Fig. 113. At\r\nthe end of the operation any residual carbon dioxid in the apparatus\r\nis removed by aspiration after removing the tap and connecting it\r\nwith a soda-lime tube to hold the carbon dioxid in the air. A large\r\nbalance suited to weighing the koumiss bottle is required for this\r\ndetermination. The carbon dioxid may also be determined, but less\r\naccurately, by loss of weight in the koumiss bottle after adding weight\r\nof water retained in the apparatus.\r\n\r\n=519. Acidity.=—Although koumiss may contain a trace of acetic acid,\r\nit is best to determine the acid as lactic. The clarification is\r\nmost easily accomplished by mixing the koumiss with an equal volume\r\nof ninety-five per cent alcohol, shaking and filtering. The first\r\nfiltrate will usually be found clear. If not it is refiltered. In an\r\naliquot part of the filtrate the acidity is determined by titration\r\nwith tenth-normal sodium hydroxid solution, using phenolphthalein as\r\nindicator. The necessary corrections for dilution and volume of the\r\nprecipitated casein are to be made. A linen filter may be used when\r\npaper is found too slow.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 113. APPARATUS FOR DETERMINING CARBON DIOXID IN\r\nKOUMISS.]\r\n\r\n=520. Alcohol.=—Half a liter of koumiss, to which 100 cubic centimeters\r\nof water have been added, is distilled until the distillate amounts to\r\n500 cubic centimeters.\r\n\r\nIf the distillate be turbid 100 cubic centimeters of water are added\r\nand the distillation repeated. The alcohol is determined by the\r\nprocesses described hereafter.\r\n\r\n=521. Lactose.=—The milk sugar may be determined by any of the methods\r\ndescribed, but most conveniently by double dilution and polarization\r\n(=86=).\r\n\r\n=522. Fat.=—Evaporate twenty grams of the sample to dryness and extract\r\nwith pure ether or petroleum spirit in the manner already described\r\n(=455=).\r\n\r\nThe analysis is more quickly accomplished by the volumetric method of\r\nBabcock or Gerber (=473-475=).\r\n\r\n=523. Proteids.=—The total proteids are most easily estimated by the\r\nofficial kjeldahl method.[530] The separation of the proteid bodies is\r\naccomplished by the methods described in paragraphs =475-489=.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the methods already described for separating the soluble\r\nand suspended proteid bodies in milk, and which may be used also for\r\nkoumiss, the following should also be mentioned as of especial worth:\r\n\r\n_Separation by Filtration through Porous Porcelain._—A purely physical\r\nmethod, and one which is to be recommended by reason of the absence\r\nof any chemical action upon the different proteid matters, is that\r\nproposed by Lehmann, depending upon the principle that when milk is\r\nforced through porous porcelain, the albumin passes through together\r\nwith the milk, sugar and other soluble constituents as a clear\r\nfiltrate, while the casein and fat are perfectly retained.[531]\r\n\r\nBy this method it is quite certain that the albumin and other perfectly\r\nsoluble proteids of milk may be obtained in the purest form.\r\n\r\n_Separation by Precipitation with Alum._—Probably the best chemical\r\nmethod of separating the two classes of proteid matters is that\r\nproposed by Schlosmann, which is effected by means of precipitating the\r\ncasein with a solution of alum.[532]\r\n\r\nThe principle of this separation rests upon the fact that a solution\r\nof potash alum, when added to milk diluted with four or five times its\r\nvolume of water, will completely separate the casein without affecting\r\nthe albumin or globulin. The operation is conducted as follows:\r\n\r\nTen cubic centimeters of the milk are diluted with from three to five\r\ntimes that quantity of water and warmed to a temperature of about\r\n40°. One cubic centimeter of a concentrated solution of potash alum\r\nis added, the mixture well stirred and the coagula which are formed\r\nallowed to subside. If the coagulation of the casein does not take\r\nplace promptly, a small addition of the alum solution is made, usually\r\nnot exceeding half a cubic centimeter, until the precipitation is\r\ncomplete. The temperature during the process should be kept as nearly\r\nas possible 40°. After a few minutes, the mixture is poured upon a\r\nfilter and the filtrate, if not perfectly clear, is poured back until\r\nit is secured free of turbidity. In difficult cases the filtration may\r\nbe promoted by the addition of some common salt or calcium phosphate,\r\nthe latter acting mechanically in holding back the fine particles of\r\ncasein. The precipitate is washed with water at a temperature of 40°,\r\nand afterwards with alcohol, not allowing the alcohol wash water to\r\nflow into the filtrate. When the water has been chiefly removed from\r\nthe precipitate by washing with alcohol, the fat of the precipitated\r\ncasein is removed with ether and the residue used for the determination\r\nof nitrogen in the usual way. The albumin is removed from the filtrate\r\nby a tannin solution in the manner already described (=480=). If it be\r\ndesired to separate the albumin and globulin, the methods described in\r\nparagraph =399= may be used.\r\n\r\n=524. Mercurial Method.=—A volumetric method for determining the total\r\nproteid matter in milk has lately been proposed by Deniges.[533] It is\r\nbased upon the observation that in the precipitation of proteid matter\r\nby mercury salts, a definite quantity of mercury in proportion to the\r\namount of proteid, is carried down therewith. The precipitation is made\r\nwith a mercurial salt of known strength and the excess of the mercurial\r\nsalt in the filtrate is determined by titration. For the details of the\r\nmanipulation, the paper cited above may be consulted.\r\n\r\n=525. Water and Ash.=—From two to five grams of the koumiss are dried\r\nto constant weight in a flat platinum dish over ignited sand, asbestos\r\nor pumice stone, and the dried residue incinerated.\r\n\r\n=526. Composition of Koumiss.=—The composition of koumiss varies with\r\nthe character of the milk used and the extent of the fermentation. Some\r\nof the data obtained by analysts are given below:[534]\r\n\r\n    COMPOSITION OF KOUMISS.\r\n\r\n                                                      Carbon\r\n    Kind     Water,  Sugar,  Alcohol, Fat,  Proteid,  dioxid,  Acidity,\r\n     of       Per    Per      Per     Per    Per       Per      Per\r\n    milk.    cent.  cent.     cent    cent.  cent.    cent.    cent.\r\n    Cow      89.32   4.38    0.76     2.08   2.56     0.83      0.47\r\n    Probably  3.95   1.38    0.88     2.89               0.82\r\n      cow\r\n      skim’d\r\n    Mare     91.87   0.79     2.89    1.19     1.91               1.04\r\n\r\nFrom the above it is seen that koumiss is made either from whole or\r\nskim milk, and that the percentage of alcohol may vary within large\r\nlimits, its proportion being inverse to that of the milk sugar.\r\n\r\nKoumiss is a beverage which is very palatable, easily digested and one\r\nwhich is not appreciated in this country in proportion to its merits,\r\nespecially for the use of invalids.\r\n\r\n\r\nAUTHORITIES CITED IN PART SIXTH.\r\n\r\n[400] Wiley; Proceedings of the Society for the Promotion of\r\nAgricultural Science, 1889, p. 84.

Classification.=—In the preceding parts have been set forth the\r\nfundamental principles underlying the conduct of agricultural analysis\r\nand a résumé of the best practice of the art. The analyst, as a rule,\r\nwill seldom be required to undertake investigations which are unnoticed\r\nin the preceding pages. Cases will arise, however, in which problems\r\nare presented which can not be solved by the rules already elucidated.\r\nIn respect of the great classes of agricultural bodies, it will be\r\nobserved that dairy products have already received special mention.\r\nIn respect of foods and fodders in general, it is evident that they\r\nare chiefly composed of moisture, ash, carbohydrates, oils and proteid\r\nmatters. The methods of identifying, separating and estimating these\r\nconstituents have been fully set forth. It is not necessary, therefore,\r\nto study in this part the analytical processes which are applicable\r\nto cereals, cattle foods and other food products, further than is\r\nnecessary to present in the most important cases a working résumé of\r\nprinciples and methods. There remain, however, certain products of\r\nimportance which require some special modifications of treatment,\r\nand it is to these that the present part will be chiefly devoted.\r\nAmong these are found tobacco, tea and coffee, fruits, fermented and\r\ndistilled drinks and certain animal products. It is evident that an\r\nenumeration of all agricultural products, with a description of their\r\nmethods of examination, would be impracticable in the available space\r\nand undesirable by reason of the repetition which would be required.\r\nIn each case the analyst, in possession of the methods described, will\r\nbe able to adapt the means at his disposal to the desired purpose to\r\nbetter advantage than any rigid directions could possibly secure.\r\n\r\nIn respect of the analytical methods of determining the nutritive\r\nvalue of foods, they may be divided into chemical and physiological.\r\nThe chemical methods embrace the thermal and artificial digestion\r\ninvestigations, and the physiological include those which are carried\r\nout with the help of the animal organisms. In the latter case the\r\ndigestive process is checked by the analysis of the foods before\r\ningestion and of the excreta of all kinds during and after digestion.\r\n\r\nIt is evident that a detailed description of this method should be\r\nlooked for in works devoted to physiological chemistry.\r\n\r\n\r\nCEREALS AND CEREAL FOODS.\r\n\r\n=528. General Analysis.=—The cereals are prepared for analysis by\r\ngrinding until the fragments pass a sieve having circular perforations\r\nhalf a millimeter in diameter. The moisture, ash, ether extract,\r\nproteids and carbohydrates are determined by some one of the\r\nprocesses already described in detail. In this country the methods\r\nof the Association of Official Agricultural Chemists are generally\r\nfollowed.[535] For convenience these methods are summarized below.\r\n\r\n_Moisture._—Dry from two to three grams of the fine-ground sample for\r\nfive hours, at the temperature of boiling water, in a current of dry\r\nhydrogen. If the substance be held in a glass vessel, the latter should\r\nnot be in contact with the boiling water.\r\n\r\n_Ash._—Char from two to three grams of the sample and burn to whiteness\r\nat the lowest possible red heat. If a white ash can not be obtained in\r\nthis manner, exhaust the charred mass with water, collect the insoluble\r\nresidue on a filter, burn it, add this ash to the residue from the\r\nevaporation of the aqueous extract and heat the whole to low redness\r\nuntil the ash is white.\r\n\r\n_Ether Extract._—Pure ether is prepared by washing the commercial\r\narticle four or five times with water to free it of the chief part\r\nof the alcohol it contains. The residual water is mostly removed by\r\ntreating the liquid with caustic soda or potash. Any residual alcohol\r\nor water is finally removed by the action of metallic sodium. The\r\nether thus prepared is stoppered, after the evolution of hydrogen has\r\nceased, and is kept over metallic sodium. Immediately before use it\r\nshould be distilled out of contact with moist air.\r\n\r\nThe residue from the determination of moisture, as described above, is\r\nextracted in an appropriate apparatus (=39=) with the pure ether for\r\nsixteen hours. The extract is dried to constant weight. The weight may\r\nbe checked by drying and weighing the extraction tube and its contents\r\nbefore and after the operation.\r\n\r\n_Crude Proteids._—Proceed as in the method of determining nitrogen in\r\nthe absence of nitrates and multiply the weight of nitrogen obtained\r\nby 6.25. This factor is a general one, but should not be rigidly\r\napplied. In each instance, according to the nature of the cereal, the\r\nappropriate factor, pointed out in paragraph =407= should be used, and\r\nthe factor 6.25 be applied only in those cases where a special factor\r\nis not given. The factors for the common cereals are wheat 5.70, rye\r\n5.62, oats 6.06, maize 6.22, barley 5.82 and flaxseed 5.62.\r\n\r\nFor separating the proteid matters consult paragraphs =392-410=. In the\r\ncase of wheat the methods of Teller may be consulted.[536]\r\n\r\n_Amid Nitrogen._—The albuminoid nitrogen is determined as directed in\r\nparagraph =203= of volume II. The difference between this number and\r\nthat representing the total nitrogen gives the nitrogen as amids.\r\n\r\n_Fiber and Carbohydrates._—The methods of analysis are described in\r\ndetail in Part Third.\r\n\r\n=529. Bread.=—In general, the same processes are followed in bread\r\nanalysis as are used with cereals and flours. In addition to\r\nthe regular analytical processes, breads are to be examined for\r\nadulterants, bleaching and coloring matters, and for the purpose of\r\ndetermining the changes which have taken place in their nutrient\r\nconstituents in the processes of fermentation and cooking.\r\n\r\n_Temperature of Baking._—The interior of a loaf during the process\r\nof baking does not attain the high temperature commonly supposed.\r\nThis temperature is rarely found to be more than one degree above the\r\nboiling point of water.[537] In biscuits and other thin cakes, which\r\nbecome practically dry and which by reason of their thinness are the\r\nmore readily penetrated by heat, the temperature may go as high as 110°.\r\n\r\n_Soluble Extract._—The quantity of matters both in flour and bread,\r\nsoluble in cold water, is determined by extraction in the usual way\r\nand drying the extract. Soluble albuminoids, sugars and mineral salts\r\nare extracted by this process. When possible, the operation should be\r\nconducted both on the bread and the flour from which it is made.\r\n\r\n_Color._—In baker’s parlance is found an apparent contradiction of\r\nterms, since it speaks of bread with “no color” when the loaf is dark\r\nbrown, while a white loaf is said to have a high color. An ideal\r\ncolor for the interior of a loaf is a light cream tint, which is\r\nmore desirable than a pure white.[538] The texture, odor and flavor of\r\nthe loaf are also to be considered, but these are properties of more\r\nimportance to the technical expert than to the analyst.\r\n\r\n_Quantity of Water._—It is not possible to set a rule of limitation in\r\nrespect of the quantity of water a bread should hold. For full loaves,\r\nperhaps forty per cent is not too high a maximum, while some authors\r\nput it as low as thirty-four per cent. Some flours are capable of\r\nholding more water than others, and the loaf should have just enough\r\nwater to impart to the slice of bread the requisite degree of softness\r\nand the proper texture. Most breads will have a content of water\r\nranging from thirty to forty per cent. In biscuits and other thin cakes\r\nthe moisture is much less in quantity.\r\n\r\n_Acidity._—The acidity of both bread and flour is determined by shaking\r\nten grams of the sample with 200 cubic centimeters of distilled water\r\nfor fifteen minutes, pouring the mass on a filter and titrating an\r\naliquot part of the filtrate with tenth-normal alkali. The acidity is\r\nreckoned as lactic acid in the case of breads raised by fermentation.\r\n\r\n_Nature of Nitrogenous Compounds._—The methods of investigation are\r\ndescribed in paragraphs =392-410=.\r\n\r\n=530. Determination of Alum in Bread.=—The presence of alum in bread\r\nmay be detected by means of logwood. Five grams of fresh logwood chips\r\nare digested with 100 cubic centimeters of amyl alcohol. One cubic\r\ncentimeter of this decoction and the same quantity of a saturated\r\nsolution of ammonium carbonate are mixed with ten grams of flour and\r\nan equal quantity of water. With pure flour, a slight pink tint is\r\nproduced. In the presence of alum the color changes to a lavender or\r\nblue, which is persistent on heating.\r\n\r\nThe test may be varied by diluting five cubic centimeters of the\r\nreagents mentioned with ninety cubic centimeters of water and pouring\r\nthe mixture over ten grams of the crumbled bread. After standing for\r\nfive minutes, any residual liquid is poured off and the residue, washed\r\nonce with a little water, is dried in a steam bath, when the blue color\r\nis developed if alum be present.[539]\r\n\r\n=531. Chemical Changes Produced by Baking.=—Changes of a chemical\r\nnature, produced in bread by baking, are found chiefly in modifications\r\nof the starch and proteids. The starch is partly converted into dextrin\r\nand the albumins are coagulated. The changes in digestion coefficient\r\nare determined by the methods which follow. The fermentations which\r\nprecede the baking are due to the usual decompositions of the\r\ncarbohydrates under the influence of yeast germs.\r\n\r\n\r\nFODDERS, GRASSES AND ENSILAGE.\r\n\r\n=532. General Principles.=—The analyst, in examining the fibrous foods\r\nof cattle, is expected to determine moisture, ash, fiber and other\r\ncarbohydrates, ether extract and albuminoid and amid nitrogen. If a\r\nmore exhaustive study be required, the sugar and starch are separated\r\nfrom the other non-nitrogenous matters, the carbohydrate bodies\r\nyielding furfuraldehyd separately determined and the ash subjected to\r\na quantitive analysis. The processes are conducted in harmony with the\r\nprinciples and methods of procedure fully set forth in the preceding\r\npages.\r\n\r\nGreen fodders and grasses are easily dried and sampled by comminution\r\nin the shredder described on page 9, and roots by that shown on page\r\n10. The moisture is determined by drying a small sample of the shredded\r\nmass, while the rest of it is dried, first at about 60° and finally\r\nat 100°, or a little above, ground to a fine powder and subjected to\r\nanalysis by methods already described. The food values as obtained\r\nby analysis should be compared, when possible, with those secured by\r\nnatural and artificial digestion.\r\n\r\nEnsilage is shredded and analyzed in precisely the same way, but in\r\ndrying, the content of volatile acids formed during fermentation must\r\nbe considered. In other words, the loss on drying ensilage at 100°, or\r\nslightly above, is due not only to the escape of water but also to the\r\nvolatilization of the acetic acid, which is one of the final products\r\nof fermentation which the mass undergoes in the silo.\r\n\r\n=533. Organic Acids in Ensilage.=—In the examination of ensilage, the\r\norganic acids which are present may be determined by the processes\r\ndescribed in following paragraphs. The acetic acid, formed chiefly\r\nby fermentation, is conveniently determined by the method given for\r\ntobacco further on. Lactic acid is detected and estimated by expressing\r\nthe juice from a sample of ensilage, removing the acetic acid by\r\ndistillation, repeated once or twice, and treating the filtered residue\r\nwith zinc carbonate in excess, filtering and determining the zinc\r\nlactate in the filtrate. The zinc is determined by the method described\r\nfor evaporated apples and the lactic acid calculated from the weight of\r\nzinc found. Crystallized zinc lactate contains 18.18 per cent of water\r\nand 27.27 per cent of zinc oxid.[540]\r\n\r\n=534. Changes due to Fermentation in the Silo.=—Silage differs from\r\ngreen fodder in having less starch and sugar, more acetic and lactic\r\nacids and alcohol and a higher proportion of amid to albuminoid\r\nnitrogen.[541] There is also a considerable loss of nitrogenous\r\nsubstances in ensilage, due probably to their conversion into ammonium\r\nacetate, which is lost on drying.\r\n\r\n=535. Alcohol in Ensilage.=—The fermentation which takes place in the\r\nsilo is not wholly of an alcoholic nature, as the development of lactic\r\nacid, noted above, clearly indicates. The alcohol which is formed may\r\nescape and but small quantities can be detected in the ripened product.\r\nSo small is this quantity of alcohol that it appears to be useless to\r\ntry to secure a quantitive estimation of it. Qualitively, it may be\r\ndetected by collecting it in a distillate, which is neutralized or made\r\nslightly alkaline with soda or potash lye and redistilled. The greater\r\npart of the alcohol will be found in the first few cubic centimeters,\r\nwhich are made alkaline with potash lye and as much iodin added as\r\ncan be without giving a red tint to the solution. Any alcohol which is\r\npresent will soon separate as iodoform.\r\n\r\n=536. Comparative Values of Fodder and Ensilage.=—In judging of the\r\ncomparative values of green and dry fodders for feeding purposes, it is\r\nnecessary to secure representative samples in the green, quickly dried\r\nand ensilaged condition. It is quite certain that the greater part of\r\nthe sugar contained in green fodders is lost both by natural curing and\r\nby placing in a silo. When well cured by the usual processes there is\r\nbut little loss of nitrogenous matters, but in the silo this loss is\r\nof considerable magnitude, amounting in some instances to as much as\r\nthirty per cent.\r\n\r\nThe ideal way of preparing green fodders in order to preserve the\r\nmaximum food value efficiently, is to shred them and dry rapidly by\r\nartificial heat, or in the sunlight, until they are in a condition\r\nwhich insures freedom from fermentation. In this condition, when placed\r\nin bales, under heavy pressure, the food constituents are preserved in\r\nthe highest available form. The immense sugar content of the stalks of\r\nmaize and sorghum could be preserved in this way almost indefinitely.\r\n\r\n\r\nFLESH PRODUCTS.\r\n\r\n=537. Names Of Meats.=—The parts of the animal from which the meats are\r\ntaken have received distinctive names, which serve to designate the\r\nparts of the carcass offered for sale. These names are not invariable\r\nand naturally are quite different in many markets. In this country\r\nthere is some degree of uniformity among butchers in naming the meats\r\nfrom different parts. The names in scientific use for the parts of\r\nmutton, beef and pork are found in the accompanying illustrations.[542]\r\n\r\n=538. Sampling.=—When possible the whole animal should constitute the\r\nsample. The relative weights of blood, intestinal organs, hide, hoofs,\r\nhorns, bones and edible flesh are determined as accurately as possible.\r\nThe general method of preparing samples of animal products is given in\r\nparagraph =5=.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 114.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 115.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 116.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: NAMES OF CUTS OF MEAT.]\r\n\r\nThe method of sampling employed by Atwater and Woods is essentially\r\nthat just noted.[543] The sample, as received at the laboratory, is\r\nweighed, the flesh (edible portion) is then separated from the refuse\r\n(skin, bones etc.) and both portions weighed. There is always a slight\r\nloss in the separation, evidently due to evaporation and to small\r\nfragments of the tissues that adhere to the hands and to the implements\r\nused in preparing the sample. The perfect separation of the flesh from\r\nthe other tissues is difficult, but the loss resulting from this is\r\nsmall. In sampling the material for analysis, it is finely chopped,\r\neither in a tray or in a sausage cutter, and in each case is well mixed.\r\n\r\n=539. Methods of Analysis.=—The general methods for the analyses of\r\nfood products are applicable to meats and animal products in general.\r\nIn the separation of the nitrogenous constituents the methods described\r\nin paragraphs =411-414= are followed. It is not safe to estimate as\r\nproteids the total nitrogen multiplied by 6.25, since the flesh bases\r\nhave much higher percentages of nitrogen than are found in proteid\r\nmatters. As indicated in paragraph =280= the complete extraction of\r\ndried meats by ether is difficult of accomplishment. After a few hours\r\nit may be assumed that the total extract will represent the fat,\r\nalthough additional soluble matters are obtained by continuing the\r\nprocess. The heat producing power may be calculated from the analytical\r\ndata secured. The methods which have been described in the preceding\r\npages will be found sufficient for guidance in the examination of\r\nanimal products, and the analyst will find them, when modified to suit\r\nparticular cases, adapted to the isolation and estimation of proximate\r\nfood principles.\r\n\r\nThe methods of analyses followed by Atwater and Woods are given\r\nbelow:[544]\r\n\r\n_Water and Water-Free Substance._—The drying is done in ordinary water\r\novens at a temperature of nominally 100°, but actually at 96° and 98°.\r\nFor each analysis of animal tissues (flesh) one or more samples of from\r\nfifty to one hundred grams of the freshly chopped substance are weighed\r\non a small plate, heated for from twenty-four to forty-eight hours,\r\ncooled, allowed to stand in the open air for about twenty-four hours,\r\nweighed, ground, sifted through a sieve with circular holes one-half\r\nmillimeter in diameter, bottled and set aside for analysis. In case of\r\nfat samples which cannot be worked through so fine a sieve, either a\r\ncoarser sieve is used or the substance crushed as finely as practicable\r\nand bottled without sifting.\r\n\r\nFor the complete desiccation, about two grams of material are dried for\r\nthree hours. It is extremely difficult to get an absolutely constant\r\nweight, though it is found that this is in most cases approximately\r\nattained in four hours.\r\n\r\n_Nitrogen, Protein, Albuminoids etc._—The nitrogen is determined in\r\nthe partly dried substance by the method of Kjeldahl. The protein is\r\ncalculated by multiplying the percentage of nitrogen by 6.25. The\r\nnitrogenous matters in meats and fish, _i. e._, in the materials which\r\nhave practically no carbohydrates, are also estimated by subtracting\r\nthe sum of ether extract and ash from the water-free substance, or\r\nthe sum of water, ether extract and ash from the fresh substance, the\r\nremainder being taken as proteids, albuminoids etc., by difference.\r\nWhile this is not an absolutely correct measure of the total\r\nnitrogenous matter, it is doubtless more nearly so than the product of\r\nthe nitrogen multiplied by 6.25.\r\n\r\n_Fat (Ether Extract)._—The fat is extracted with ether in the usual\r\nmanner. The point at which the extraction is complete is not always\r\neasy to determine. For the most part, the extraction is continued for\r\nsuch time as experience indicates to be sufficient, and then the flask\r\nis replaced by another and the extraction repeated until the new flask\r\nshows no increase in weight.\r\n\r\nAccording to experience, the fat of many animal tissues is much more\r\ndifficult to extract than that of most vegetable substances. In\r\ngeneral, the greater the percentage of fat in a substance the more\r\ndifficult is the removal of the last traces. Dried flesh is frequently\r\nso hard that the fineness of the material to be extracted seems to be a\r\nvery important matter.\r\n\r\n_Ash._—Ash is determined by the method recommended by the Association\r\nof Official Agricultural Chemists.\r\n\r\n_Food Value—Potential Energy._—The food materials are not necessarily\r\nburned in the calorimeter, but the fuel value of a pound of each of the\r\nfoods, as given in the tables, is obtained by multiplying the number of\r\nhundredths of a pound of protein and of carbohydrates by 18.6 and the\r\nnumber of hundredths of a pound of fat by 42.2, and taking the sum of\r\nthese three products as the number of calories of potential energy in\r\nthe materials.\r\n\r\nMore reliable results are obtained by using the factors obtained by\r\nStohmann; _viz._, 5731 calories for proteids, 9500 calories for common\r\nglycerids, 9231 calories for butter fat, 3746 calories for pentose\r\nsugars, 3749 calories for dextrose and levulose and 3953 calories for\r\nsucrose and milk sugar.[545]\r\n\r\n=540. Further Examination of Nitrogenous Bodies.=—It is evident\r\nthat both of the methods proposed above for the examination of the\r\nnitrogenous constituents of meats are unreliable. If the total nitrogen\r\nbe determined and multiplied by 6.25 the product does not by any means\r\nrepresent the true quantity of nitrogenous matter since the flesh bases\r\ncontain in some instances more than twenty-five per cent of nitrogen.\r\n\r\nIf, on the other hand, the water, ash and fat in a meat sample be\r\ndetermined and the sum of their per cents be subtracted from 100, the\r\ndifference represents the nitrogenous bodies plus all undetermined\r\nmatters and errors of analysis. The assumption that meats are free\r\nof carbohydrates is not tenable since glycogen is constantly found\r\ntherein and in horse flesh in comparatively large amounts. In a\r\nthoroughly scientific analysis of meats, the nitrogenous bodies should\r\nbe separated and determined by groups, according to the principles\r\ndeveloped in paragraphs =411-414=. This process requires a great amount\r\nof analytical work and in general it will be sufficient to make a\r\ncold water extract to secure the flesh bases and a hot water extract\r\nto secure the gelatin. The nitrogen is then determined in each of\r\nthese portions separately. The nitrogen in the cold water extract is\r\nmultiplied by four, in the hot water extract by six and in the residue\r\nby 6.25. The sum of these products represents approximately the total\r\nnitrogenous matter in the sample.\r\n\r\nAqueous extracts containing nitrogen are easily prepared for moist\r\ncombustion by placing them in the digestion flasks, connecting the\r\nlatter with the vacuum service and evaporating the contents of the\r\nflask nearly to dryness. The sulfuric acid is then added and the\r\nnitrogen converted into ammonia and determined in the usual manner.\r\n\r\n=541. Fractional Analysis of Meats.=—A better idea of the composition\r\nof a meat is obtained by separating its constituents into several\r\ngroups by the action of different solvents. This method has been\r\nelaborated by Knorr.[546]\r\n\r\nThe separation of the meats in edible portion and waste and the\r\ndetermination of moisture and fat are conducted as already described.\r\nThe residue from the fat extraction is exhausted with alcohol, and\r\nin the extract are found the nitrogenous bases kreatin, kreatinin,\r\nsarkin and xanthin, and urea, lactic, butyric, acetic and formic acids,\r\nglycogen and inosit. In the residue from the alcohol extraction, the\r\nproteid nitrogen is determined in a separate sample.\r\n\r\nA separate portion of the sample is ground to a fine paste and\r\nrepeatedly rubbed up with cold water, which is poured through a tared\r\nfilter. When the extraction is complete, the filter and its contents\r\nare dried and the dry residue determined. This residue represents\r\nthe nitrogenous constituents of the muscle fibers and their sheaths\r\ntogether with any other bodies insoluble in cold water. The filtrate\r\nfrom the cold water extraction is heated to boiling to precipitate\r\nthe albuminous matters which are collected, dried and weighed, or the\r\nnitrogen therein determined and the albuminous matters calculated by\r\nmultiplying by the usual factor. The filtrate from the coagulated\r\nalbuminous bodies is evaporated to dryness and weighed. It consists\r\nessentially of the same materials as the alcoholic extract mentioned\r\nabove. The ash and nitrogen in the aqueous extract are also determined.\r\n\r\nThe mean content of the edible parts of common meats, expressed as per\r\ncents in groups as mentioned, follow:\r\n\r\n                                        Per cent.\r\n    Water                                73.11\r\n    Ash                                   1.18\r\n    Total soluble matter                 26.89\r\n    Phosphoric acid                       0.49\r\n\r\n                                        Per cent.\r\n     { Proteids insoluble in cold water  13.76\r\n     { Of which coagulable by heat        2.24\r\n   Cold water extract                     3.56\r\n     { Ash in water extract               1.09\r\n     { Of which phosphoric acid           0.38\r\n\r\n                                        Per cent.\r\n    Fat                                   4.93\r\n    Alcohol extract                       3.03\r\n    Proteids in residue from alcohol     17.88\r\n    Total nitrogen in sample              3.37\r\n\r\n=542. Estimation of Starch in Sausages.=—Starchy substances are\r\nsometimes added to sausages for the purpose of increasing their weight.\r\nThe presence of starch in a sausage is easily detected by iodin. The\r\nquantity may be determined by the following process:[547]\r\n\r\nThe principle of the process is based upon the observation that while\r\nstarch is easily soluble in an aqueous solution of the alkalies, it is\r\ninsoluble in an alcoholic solution thereof. The chief constituents of\r\nmeat, _viz._, fat and proteid matters, on the other hand, are readily\r\nsoluble in an alcoholic solution of potash or soda. This renders the\r\nseparation of the starch easy. The sample is warmed on a water bath\r\nwith a considerable excess of an eight per cent solution of potassium\r\nhydroxid in alcohol whereby the fat and flesh are quickly dissolved.\r\nThe starch and other carbohydrate bodies, remain in an undissolved\r\nstate. In order to prevent the gelatinizing of the soap which is\r\nformed, the mass is diluted with warm alcohol, the insoluble residue\r\ncollected upon a filter and washed with alcohol until the alkaline\r\nreaction disappears. The residue is then treated with aqueous potassium\r\nhydroxid solution, whereby the starch is brought into solution and,\r\nafter filtration, is treated with alcohol until it is all precipitated.\r\nThe precipitated starch is collected upon a filter, washed with alcohol\r\nand finally with ether, dried and weighed. Starch prepared in this\r\nway contains a considerable quantity of potash, the amount of which\r\ncan be determined by incineration. In order to avoid this trouble,\r\nthe starch, after separation in the first instance as above mentioned\r\nand solution in aqueous potassium hydroxid, is precipitated on the\r\naddition of enough acetic to render the solution slightly acid. The\r\nprecipitated starch, in this instance, is practically free of potash,\r\nsince potassium acetate is soluble in alcohol.\r\n\r\n=543. Detection of Horse Flesh.=—Since horse flesh has become an\r\nimportant article of human food and is often sold as beef and sausage,\r\na method of distinguishing it is desirable. The comparative anatomist\r\nis able to detect horse flesh when accompanied by its bones, or\r\nin portions sufficiently large for the identification of muscular\r\ncharacteristics. It is well known that horse flesh contains a much\r\nhigher percentage of glycogen than is found in other edible meats.\r\nNiebel has based a method of detecting horse flesh upon this fact, the\r\nglycogen being converted into dextrose and determined in the usual way.\r\nWhenever the percentage of reducing sugars in the dry fat-free flesh\r\nexceeds one per cent, Niebel infers that the sample under examination\r\nis horse flesh.[548]\r\n\r\nThe reaction for horse flesh, proposed by Bräutigam and Edelmann, is\r\npreferred by Baumert. In this test about fifty grams of the flesh are\r\nboiled for an hour with 200 cubic centimeters of water, the filtered\r\nbouillon evaporated to about half its volume, treated with dilute\r\nnitric acid and the clear filtrate covered with iodin water. Horse\r\nflesh, by reason of its high glycogen content, produces a burgundy\r\nred zone at the points of contact of the two liquids. In the case of\r\nsausages, if starch have been added, a blue zone is produced, and if\r\ndextrin be present, a red zone, both of which obscure the glycogen\r\nreaction. The starch is easily removed by treating the bouillon with\r\nglacial acetic acid. No method is at present known for separating\r\ndextrin from glycogen. The detection of horse flesh is a matter of\r\nconsiderable importance to agriculture as well as to the consumers,\r\nespecially of sausages. A considerable quantity of horse flesh is\r\nannually sent to the market, little of which presumably is sold under\r\nits own name. As a cheap substitute for beef and pork in sausages, its\r\nuse must be regarded as fraudulent, although no objection can be urged\r\nagainst its sale when offered under its own name.[549]\r\n\r\n\r\nMETHODS OF DIGESTION.\r\n\r\n=544. Artificial Digestion.=—The nutrient values of cereals and other\r\nfoods are determined both by chemical analysis and by digestion\r\nexperiments. The heat forming properties of foods are disclosed by\r\ncombustion in a calorimeter, but the quantity of heat produced is not\r\nin every case a guide to the ascertainment of the nutritive value. This\r\nis more certainly shown, especially in the case of proteid bodies, by\r\nthe action of the natural digestive ferments.\r\n\r\nIt is probable that the digestion, which is secured by the action of\r\nthese ferments without the digestive organs, is not always the same as\r\nthe natural process, but when the conditions which prevail in natural\r\ndigestion are imitated as closely as possible the effects produced can\r\nbe considered as approximately those of the alimentary canal in healthy\r\naction.\r\n\r\nThree classes of ferments are active in artificial digestion, _viz._,\r\namylolytic ferments, serving to hydrolyze starch and sugars and to\r\nconvert them into dextrose, maltose and levulose, aliphalytic ferments,\r\nwhich decompose the glycerids and proteolytic ferments, which act on\r\nthe nitrogenous constituents of foods. When these ferments are made\r\nto act on foods under proper conditions of acidity and temperature,\r\nartificial digestion ensues, and by the measurement of the extent\r\nof the action an approximate estimate of their digestibility can be\r\nsecured. In artificial digestion, the temperature should be kept near\r\nthat of the body, _viz._, at about 40°.\r\n\r\nThe soluble ferments which are active in the digestion of foods, as\r\nhas been intimated, comprise three great classes. Among the first\r\nclass, _viz._, the amylolytic ferments, are included not only those\r\nwhich convert starch into dextrose, but also those which cause the\r\nhydrolysis of sugars in general. Among these may be mentioned ptyalin,\r\ninvertase, trehalase, maltase, lactase, diastase, inulase, pectase\r\nand cyto-hydrolytic ferments which act upon the celluloses and other\r\nfibers.\r\n\r\nAmong the aliphalytic ferments, in addition to those which act also\r\nupon proteid matter, may be mentioned a special one, lipase.\r\n\r\nIn the third class of ferments are found pepsin, trypsin or pancreatin\r\nand papain.\r\n\r\nFor the latest information in regard to the nature of the soluble\r\nferments and their nomenclature, the work of Bourquelot may be\r\nconsulted.[550]\r\n\r\n=545. Amylytic Ferments.=—A very active ferment of this kind is found\r\nin the saliva. Saliva may be easily collected from school boys, who\r\nwill be found willing to engage in its production if supplied with\r\na chewing gum. A gum free of sugar is to be used, or if the chewing\r\ngum of commerce is employed, the saliva should not be collected\r\nuntil the sugar has disappeared. A dozen boys with vigorous chewing\r\nwill soon provide a sufficient quantity of saliva for practical use.\r\nThe amylolytic digestion is conducted in the apparatus hereinafter\r\ndescribed for digestion with pepsin and pancreatin. The starch or\r\nsugar in fine powder is mixed with ten parts of water and one part of\r\nsaliva and kept at about 37°.5 for a definite time. The product is then\r\nexamined for starch, sucrose, maltose, dextrose, dextrin and levulose\r\nby the processes already described. In natural digestion the hydrolysis\r\nof the carbohydrates is not completed in the mouth. The action of\r\nthe ferment is somewhat diminished in the stomach, but not perhaps\r\nuntil half an hour after eating. The dilute hydrochloric acid in the\r\nstomach, which accumulates some time after eating, is not active in\r\nthis hydrolysis. On the contrary the amylolytic ferment of the saliva\r\nis somewhat enfeebled by the presence of an acid. The active principle\r\nof the saliva is ptyalin.\r\n\r\nThe diastatic hydrolysis of starch has already been described (=179=).\r\nIt is best secured at a somewhat higher temperature than that of the\r\nhuman stomach.\r\n\r\n=546. Aliphalytic Ferments.=—In the hydrolysis of glycerids in the\r\nprocess of digestion the fat acids and glycerol are set free. Whether\r\nthe glycerids be completely hydrolyzed before absorption is not\r\ndefinitely known. In certain cases where large quantities of oil have\r\nbeen exhibited for remedial purposes, the fat acids and soaps have been\r\nfound in spherical masses in the dejecta[551] and have been mistaken for\r\ngall stones.\r\n\r\nThe fat which enters the chyle appears to be mostly unchanged, except\r\nthat it is emulsified.[552] The aliphalytic ferment can be prepared\r\nfrom the fresh pancreas, preferably from animals that have not been\r\nfed for forty hours before killing. It is important to prepare the\r\nferment entirely free of any trace of acid. The fresh glands are rubbed\r\nto a fine paste with powdered glass and extracted for four days with\r\npure glycerol, to which one part of one per cent soda solution has\r\nbeen added. The filtered liquor contains aliphalytic, proteolytic and\r\namylytic ferments, and is employed for saponification by shaking with\r\nthe fat to form an emulsion and keeping the mixture, with occasional\r\nshaking, at a temperature of from 40° to 60°. The free acids can\r\nbe titrated or separated from the unsaponified fats by solution in\r\nalcohol.[553]\r\n\r\nHeretofore it has not been possible to separate a pure aliphalytic\r\nferment from any of the digestive glands. The digestion of\r\ncarbohydrates and that of fats are intimately associated, and these\r\ntwo classes of foods seem to play nearly the same rôle in the animal\r\neconomy.\r\n\r\nThe aliphalytic ferments, prepared from the fresh pancreas, act also on\r\nthe glucosids and other ester-like carbohydrate bodies. Since the fats\r\nmay be regarded as ethers, the double action indicates the similarity\r\nof composition in the two classes of bodies.[554] The aliphalytic\r\nferments exist also in plants and have been isolated from rape seed.[555]\r\n\r\n=547. Proteolytic Ferments.=—The most important process in artificial\r\ndigestion is the one relating to the action of the ferments on proteid\r\nmatters. The hydrolysis of fats and carbohydrates by natural ferments\r\ntakes place best in an alkaline medium, while in the case of proteids\r\nwhen pepsin is used an acid medium is preferred. Since the acidity\r\nof the stomach is due chiefly to hydrochloric, that acid is employed\r\nin artificial digestion. The hydrolyte used is uniformly the natural\r\nferment of the gastric secretions, _viz._, pepsin; but this is often\r\nfollowed by the pancreatic ferment, (pancreatin, trypsin) in an\r\nalkaline medium. During the digestion, the proteids are changed into\r\npeptones, and the measurement of this change determines the degree of\r\ndigestion. The total proteid matter is determined in the sample, and\r\nafter the digestion is completed, the soluble peptones are removed\r\nby washing and the residual insoluble proteid matter determined by\r\nmoist combustion. The difference in the two determinations shows the\r\nquantity of proteid matter digested. The investigations of Kühn on the\r\ndigestion of proteids may be profitably consulted.[556] For a summary\r\nof digestion experiments in this country the résumé prepared by Gordon\r\nmay be consulted.[557] The method followed in this laboratory is fully\r\ndescribed by Bigelow and Hamilton.[558]\r\n\r\n=548. Ferments Employed.=—Both the pepsins of commerce and those\r\nprepared directly from the stomachs of pigs may be used. The commercial\r\nscale pepsin is found, as a rule, entirely satisfactory, and more\r\nuniform results are secured by its use than from pepsin solutions made\r\nfrom time to time from pig stomachs. In the preparation of the pepsin\r\nsolution one gram of the best scale pepsin is dissolved in one liter\r\nof 0.33 per cent hydrochloric acid. Two grams of the sample of food\r\nproducts, in fine powder, are suspended in 100 cubic centimeters of the\r\nsolution and kept, with frequent shaking, at a temperature of 40° for\r\ntwelve hours. The contents of the flask are poured on a wet filter, the\r\nresidue on the filter well washed with water not above 40°, the filter\r\npaper and its contents transferred to a kjeldahl flask and the residual\r\nnitrogen determined and multiplied by 6.25 to get the undigested\r\nproteid matter. A large number of digestions can be conducted at once\r\nin a bath shown in Fig. 117.[559] The quantity of water in the bath\r\nshould be as large as possible.\r\n\r\n=549. Digestion in Pepsin and Pancreatin.=—The digestion of the\r\nproteids is not as a rule wholly accomplished by the stomach juices,\r\nand, therefore, in order to secure in artificial digestion results\r\napproximating those produced in the living organism, it is necessary\r\nto follow the treatment with pepsin by a similar one with the pancreas\r\njuices. The method employed in this laboratory is essentially that of\r\nStutzer modified by Wilson.[560]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 117. BATH FOR ARTIFICIAL DIGESTION.]\r\n\r\nThe residue from the pepsin digestion, after washing, is treated for\r\nsix hours at near 40° with 100 cubic centimeters of pancreas solution,\r\nprepared as follows:\r\n\r\nFree the pancreas of a healthy steer of fat, pass it through a sausage\r\ngrinder, rub one kilogram in a mortar with fine sand and allow to stand\r\nfor a day or longer. Add three liters of lime water, one of glycerol,\r\nof 1.23 specific gravity, and a little chloroform and set aside for\r\nsix days. Separate the liquor by pressure in a bag and filter it\r\nthrough paper. Before using, mix a quarter of a liter of the filtrate\r\nwith three-quarters of a liter of water and five grams of dry sodium\r\ncarbonate, or its equivalent crystallized, heat from 38° to 40° for\r\ntwo hours and filter.[561] In order to avoid the trouble of preparing\r\nthe pancreas solution pure active pancreatin may be used.[562] One and\r\na half grams of pure pancreatin and three grams of sodium carbonate\r\nare dissolved in one liter of water and 100 cubic centimeters of this\r\nsolution are used for each two grams of the sample. In all cases where\r\ncommercial pepsin and pancreatin are used, their activity should be\r\ntested with bodies such as boiled whites of eggs, whose coefficient of\r\ndigestibility is well known and those samples be rejected which do not\r\nprove to have the required activity.[563]\r\n\r\n=550. Digestion in Pancreas Extract.=—In order to save the time\r\nrequired for successive digestions in pepsin and pancreatin Niebling\r\nhas proposed to make the digestion in the pancreas extract alone.[564]\r\nThis process and also a slight modification of it have been used with\r\nsuccess by Bigelow and McElroy.[565] Two grams of the sample are washed\r\nwith ether and placed in a digestion flask with 100 cubic centimeters\r\nof two-tenths per cent hydrochloric acid. The contents of the flask\r\nare boiled for fifteen minutes, cooled, and made slightly alkaline\r\nwith sodium carbonate. One hundred cubic centimeters of the unfiltered\r\npancreas solution, prepared as directed above, are added and the\r\ndigestion continued at 40° for six hours. The residue is thrown on a\r\nfilter, washed, and the nitrogen determined. The method is simplified\r\nby the substitution of active commercial pancreatin for pancreas\r\nextract. The solution of the ferment is made of the same strength as is\r\nspecified above.\r\n\r\n=551. Artificial Digestion of Cheese.=—The artificial digestion of\r\ncheese is conducted by Stutzer as follows:[566]\r\n\r\nThe digestive liquor is prepared from the fresh stomachs of pigs by\r\ncutting them into fine pieces and mixing with five liters of water and\r\n100 cubic centimeters of hydrochloric acid for each stomach. To prevent\r\ndecomposition, two and a half grams of thymol, previously dissolved in\r\nalcohol, are added to each 600 cubic centimeters of the mixture. The\r\nmixture is allowed to stand for a day with occasional shaking, poured\r\ninto a flannel bag and the liquid portion allowed to drain without\r\npressing. The liquor obtained in this way is filtered, first through\r\ncoarse and then through fine paper, and when thus prepared will keep\r\nseveral months without change. It is advisable to determine the content\r\nof hydrochloric acid in the liquor by titration and this content should\r\nbe two-tenths of a per cent. The cheese to be digested is mixed with\r\nsand as previously described, freed of fat by extraction with ether,\r\nand a quantity corresponding to five grams of cheese placed in a\r\nbeaker, covered with half a liter of the digestive liquor and kept at\r\na temperature of 40° for forty-eight hours. At intervals of two hours\r\nthe flasks are well shaken and five cubic centimeters of a ten per\r\ncent solution of hydrochloric acid added and this treatment continued\r\nuntil the quantity of hydrochloric acid amounts to one per cent. After\r\nthe digestion is finished, the contents of the beaker are thrown on a\r\nfilter, washed with water and the nitrogen determined in the usual way\r\nin the residue. By allowing the pepsin solution to act for two days as\r\ndescribed above, the subsequent digestion with pancreas solution is\r\nsuperfluous.\r\n\r\n=552. Suggestions Regarding Manipulation.=—The filter papers should\r\nbe as quick working as possible to secure the separation of all\r\nundissolved particles. They should be of sufficient size to hold the\r\nwhole contents of the digestion flask at once, since if allowed to\r\nbecome empty and partially dry, filtration is greatly impeded. The\r\nresidue should be dried at once if not submitted immediately to moist\r\ncombustion. After drying, the determination of the nitrogen can be\r\nmade at any convenient time. Beaker flasks, _i. e._, lip erlenmeyers\r\nwith a wide mouth are most convenient for holding the materials during\r\ndigestion. The flasks are most conveniently held by a crossed rubber\r\nband attached at either end to pins in the wooden slats extending\r\nacross the digestive bath. The bath should be suspended by cords from\r\nsupports on the ceiling and a gentle rotatory motion imparted to it\r\nresembling the peristaltic action attending natural digestion.\r\n\r\n=553. Natural Digestion.=—The digestion of foods by natural processes\r\nis determined chiefly by the classes of ferments already noted. The\r\nprinciple underlying digestive experiments with the animal organism\r\nmay be stated as follows: A given weight of food of known composition\r\nis fed to a healthy animal under the conditions of careful control and\r\npreparation already mentioned. The solid dejecta of the animal during a\r\ngiven period are collected and weighed daily, being received directly\r\nfrom the animal in an appropriate bag, safely secured, as is shown in\r\nthe accompanying figure. The dejecta are weighed, dried, ground to a\r\nfine powder, mixed and a representative part analyzed. The difference\r\nbetween the solid bodies in the dejecta and those given in the food\r\nduring the period of experiment represents those nutrients which have\r\nbeen digested and absorbed during the passage of the food through the\r\nalimentary canal. The urine, containing solid bodies representing the\r\nwaste of the animal organism, does not require to be analyzed for the\r\nsimple control of digestive activity outlined above. In a complete\r\ndetermination of this kind the exhalations from the surface of the\r\nbody and from the lungs are also determined. In the latter case the\r\nhuman animal is selected for the experiment; in the former it is more\r\nconvenient to employ the lower animals, such as the sheep and cow.\r\n\r\nThe arrangement of the stalls and of the apparatus for collecting the\r\nexcreta should be such as is both convenient and effective.[567]\r\n\r\nThe method of constructing a bag for attachment to a sheep is shown in\r\nFig. 118. It is made according to the directions given by Gay, of heavy\r\ncloth and in such a way as to fit closely the posterior parts of the\r\nanimal.[568] When attached, its appearance is shown in Fig. 119.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 118.—BAG FOR COLLECTING FECES.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 119.—FECAL BAG ATTACHMENT.]\r\n\r\nHealthy animals in the prime of life are used, and the feeding\r\nexperiments are conducted with as large a number of animals as\r\npossible, in order to eliminate the effects of idiosyncrasy. The food\r\nused is previously prepared in abundant quantity and its composition\r\ndetermined by the analysis of an average sample.\r\n\r\nThe feeding period is divided into two parts. In the first part the\r\nanimal is fed for a few days with the selected food until it is certain\r\nthat all the excreta are derived from the nutrients used. In the second\r\npart the same food is continued and the excreta collected, weighed, the\r\nmoisture determined, and the total weight of the water-free excreta\r\nascertained. The first part should be of at least seven and the second\r\nof at least five days duration. The urine and dung are analyzed\r\nseparately. Males are preferred for the digestion experiments because\r\nof the greater ease of collecting the urine and feces without mixing.\r\nFor ordinary purposes the feces only are collected. The methods of\r\nanalysis do not differ from those described for the determination of\r\nthe usual ingredients of a food.\r\n\r\n_Example._—The following data taken from the results of digestive\r\nexperiments, obtained at the Maine Station, will illustrate the method\r\nof comparing the composition of the food with that of the feces and\r\nof determining the degree of digestion which the proteids and other\r\nconstituents of the food have undergone.\r\n\r\n    COMPOSITION OF MAIZE FODDER AND OF FECES\r\n          THEREFROM AFTER FEEDING TO SHEEP.\r\n\r\n                     BEFORE DRYING.\r\n                 Water,   Ash,  Proteid,  Fiber,   Fat, Undetermined,\r\n                   per     per     per      per     per     per\r\n       Food.      cent.   cent.   cent.    cent.   cent.   cent.\r\n    Sweet maize  83.85    1.13    2.18     4.14    0.62    8.08\r\n    Feces        72.01    ...      ...      ...     ...     ...\r\n\r\n                                DRY.\r\n                    Ash,    Proteid,  Fiber,   Fat,  Undetermined,\r\n                    per      per       per     per      per\r\n       Food.        cent.    cent.     cent.   cent.    cent.\r\n    Sweet maize     7.01     13.52    25.63    3.86      49.98\r\n    Feces           14.42    17.52    19.34    2.68      46.04\r\n\r\n                    DAILY WEIGHTS.\r\n                      Green,    Dry,\r\n       Food.          grams.   grams.\r\n    Sweet maize         2521     407\r\n    Feces                445     125\r\n\r\n                   PER CENT DIGESTED.\r\n       Food.

These data\r\nare taken only from the results obtained from a single sheep and one\r\narticle of food. The mean data secured from two animals and three kinds\r\nof maize fodder show the following per cents of digestibility: Ash\r\n39.4, proteid 61.8, fiber 76.7, undetermined matters 72.1, fat 76.4.\r\nThe undetermined matters are those usually known as nitrogen free\r\nextract and composed chiefly of pentosans and other carbohydrates.[569]\r\n\r\n=554. Natural Digestibility of Pentosans.=—The digestibility of\r\npentosan bodies in foods under the influence of natural ferments\r\nhas been investigated by Lindsey and Holland.[570] The feeding and\r\ncollection of the feces is carried on as described above and the\r\nrelative proportions of pentosan bodies in the foods and feces\r\ndetermined by estimating the furfuraldehyd as prescribed in paragraph\r\n=150=.[571]\r\n\r\n\r\nPRESERVED MEATS.\r\n\r\n=555. Methods of Examination.=—In general the methods of examination\r\nare the same as those applied in the study of fresh meats. The contents\r\nof water, salt and other preservatives, fat and nitrogenous matters are\r\nof most importance. When not already in a fine state, the preserved\r\nmeats are run through meat cutters until reduced to a fine pulp. Most\r\npotted meats are already in a state of subdivision well suited to\r\nanalytical work. The composition of preserved meats has been thoroughly\r\nstudied in this laboratory by Davis.[572]\r\n\r\n=556. Estimation Of Fat.=—Attention has already been called to\r\nthe difficulty of extracting the fat from meats by ether or other\r\nsolvents.[573] In preserved meats, as well as in fresh, it is preferable\r\nto adopt some method which will permit of the decomposition of the\r\nother organic matters and the separation of the fat in a free state.\r\nThe most promising methods are those employed in milk analyses for\r\nthe solution of nitrogenous matters. Sulfuric or hydrochloric acid\r\nmay be used for this purpose, preference being given to sulfuric. The\r\nseparated fats may be taken up with ether or separated by centrifugal\r\naction. A method of this kind for preserved meats, suggested by\r\nHefelmann, is described below.\r\n\r\nAbout six grams of the moist preserved meat are placed in a calibrated\r\ntest tube and dissolved in twenty-five cubic centimeters of fuming\r\nhydrochloric acid. The tube is placed in a water bath, quickly heated\r\nto boiling and kept at that temperature for half an hour. About twenty\r\ncubic centimeters of cold water are added and the temperature lowered\r\nto 30°, then twenty cubic centimeters of ether and the tube gently\r\nshaken to promote the solution of the fat. When the ether layer has\r\nseparated, its volume is read and an aliquot part removed by means of a\r\npipette, dried and weighed. The separation of the ethereal solution is\r\ngreatly promoted by whirling.\r\n\r\nThe mean proportions of the ingredients of preserved meats are about as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n                        Per cent.\r\n\r\n    Water                 67.0\r\n    Dry matter            33.0\r\n\r\nOf which\r\n\r\n    Nitrogenous bodies    19.0\r\n    Fats                  10.5\r\n    Ash and undetermined   3.5\r\n\r\n=557. Meat Preservatives.=—Various bodies are used to give taste and\r\ncolor to preserved meats and to preserve them from fermentation. The\r\nmost important of these bodies are common salt, potassium and sodium\r\nnitrates, sulfurous, boric, benzoic and salicylic acids, formaldehyd,\r\nsaccharin and hydronaphthol. A thorough study of the methods of\r\ndetecting and isolating these bodies has been made in this laboratory\r\nby Davis and the results are yet to be published as a part of Bulletin\r\n13.\r\n\r\n\r\nDETERMINATION OF NUTRITIVE VALUES.\r\n\r\n=558. Nutritive Value of Foods.=—The value of a food as a nutrient\r\ndepends on the amount of heat it gives on combustion in the tissues of\r\nthe body, _i. e._ oxidation, and in its fitness to nourish the tissues\r\nof the body, to promote growth and repair waste. The foods which\r\nsupply heat to the body are organic in their nature and are typically\r\nrepresented by fats and carbohydrates. The foods which promote growth\r\nand supply waste are not only those which preeminently supply heat,\r\nbut also include the inorganic bodies and organic nitrogenous matters\r\nrepresented typically by the proteids. It is not proper to say that\r\none class of food is definitely devoted to heat forming and another to\r\ntissue building, inasmuch as the same substance may play an important\r\nrôle in both directions. As heat formers, carbohydrates and proteids\r\nhave an almost equal value, as measured by combustion in oxygen, while\r\nfat has a double value for this purpose. The assumption that combustion\r\nin oxygen forms a just criterion for determining the value of a food\r\nmust not be taken too literally. There are only a few bodies of the\r\nvast number which burn in oxygen that are capable of assimilation\r\nand oxidation by the animal organism. Only those parts of the food\r\nthat become soluble and assimilable under the action of the digestive\r\nferments, take part in nutrition and the percentage of food materials\r\ndigested varies within wide limits but rarely approaches 100. It may\r\nbe safely said that less than two-thirds of the total food materials\r\ningested are dissolved, absorbed, decomposed and assimilated in the\r\nanimal system. We have no means of knowing how far the decomposition\r\n(oxidation) extends before assimilation, and therefore no theoretical\r\nmeans of calculating the quantity of heat which is produced during the\r\nprogress of digestion. The vital thermostat is far more delicate than\r\nany mechanical contrivance for regulating temperature and the quantity\r\nof food, in a state of health, converted into heat, is just sufficient\r\nto maintain the temperature of the body at a normal degree. Any excess\r\nof heat produced, as by violent muscular exertion, is dissipated\r\nthrough the lungs, the perspiration and other secretions of the body.\r\n\r\nPure cellulose or undigestible fiber, when burned in oxygen, will\r\ngive a thermal value approximating that of sugar, but no illustration\r\nis required to show that when taken into the system the bodily heat\r\nafforded by it is insignificant in quantity.\r\n\r\nThermal values, therefore, have little comparative usefulness\r\nin determining nutritive worth, except when applied to foods of\r\napproximately the same digestive coefficient.\r\n\r\n=559. Comparative Value of Food Constituents.=—It has already been\r\nnoted that, judged by combustion in oxygen, carbohydrates and proteids\r\nhave about half the thermal value possessed by fats. Commercially,\r\nthe values of foods depend in a far greater degree on their flavor\r\nand cooking qualities than upon the amount of nutrition they\r\ncontain. Butter fat, which is scarcely more nutritious than tallow,\r\nis worth twice as much in the market, while the prices paid for\r\nvegetables and fruits are not based to any great extent on their food\r\nproperties.[574] In cereals, especially in wheat, the quantity of fat is\r\nrelatively small, and starch is the preponderating element. In meats,\r\ncarbohydrates are practically eliminated and fats and proteids are the\r\npredominating constituents.\r\n\r\nIn the markets, fats and proteids command far higher prices than\r\nsugars and starches. The relative commercial food value of a cereal\r\nmay be roughly approximated by multiplying the percentages of fat and\r\nprotein by two and a half and adding the products to the percentage of\r\ncarbohydrates less insoluble fiber. This method was adopted in valuing\r\nthe cereals at the World’s Columbian Exposition.[575]\r\n\r\n=560. Nutritive Ratio.=—In solid foods the nutritive ratio is that\r\nexisting between the percentage of proteids and that of carbohydrates,\r\nincreased by multiplying the fat by two and a half and adding the\r\nproduct. In a cereal containing twelve per cent of protein, seventy-two\r\nof carbohydrates, exclusive of fiber, and three of fat, the ratio is\r\n12: 72 + 3 × 2.5 = 6.5. Instead of calculating the nutritive ratio\r\ndirectly from the data obtained by analysis, it may be reckoned from\r\nthe per cents of the three substances in the sample multiplied by their\r\ndigestive coefficient. Since the relative amounts of proteids, fats and\r\ncarbohydrates digested do not greatly differ, the numerical expression\r\nof the nutritive ratio is nearly the same when obtained by each of\r\nthese methods of calculation.\r\n\r\nWhere the proportion of protein is relatively large the ratio is called\r\nnarrow, 1: 4 ... 6. When the proportion of protein is relatively small\r\nthe ratio is called broad 1: 8 ... 12. In feeding, the nutritive ratio\r\nis varied in harmony with the purpose in view, a narrow ratio favoring\r\nthe development of muscular energy, and a wide one promoting the\r\ndeposition of fat and the development of heat. These principles guide\r\nthe scientific farmer in mixing rations for his stock, the work horses\r\nreceiving a comparatively narrow and the beeves a relatively wide ratio\r\nin their food.\r\n\r\n=561. Calorimetric Analyses of Foods.=—The general principles of\r\ncalorimetry have been already noticed. The theoretical and chemical\r\nrelations of calorimetry have been fully discussed by Berthelot,\r\nThomsen, Ostwald and Muir.[576] In the analyses of foods the values\r\nas determined by calculation or combustion are of importance in\r\ndetermining the nutritive relations.\r\n\r\nAtwater has presented a résumé of the history and importance of\r\nthe calorimetric investigations of foods to which the analyst is\r\nreferred.[577]\r\n\r\nIn the computation of food values the percentages of proteids,\r\ncarbohydrates and fats are determined and the required data obtained\r\nby applying the factors 4100, 5500 and 9300 calories for one gram of\r\ncarbohydrates, proteids and fats respectively.\r\n\r\nFor most purposes the computed values are sufficient, but it is well to\r\ncheck them from time to time by actual combustions in a calorimeter.\r\n\r\n=562. Combustion in Oxygen.=—The author made a series of combustions\r\nof carbonaceous materials in oxygen at the laboratory of Purdue\r\nUniversity in 1877, the ignition being secured by a platinum wire\r\nrendered incandescent by the electric current. The data obtained were\r\nunsatisfactory on account of the crudeness of the apparatus. The\r\ndiscovery of the process of burning the samples in oxygen at a high\r\npressure has made it possible to get expressions of thermal data which\r\nwhile not yet perfect, possess a working degree of accuracy. The best\r\nform of bomb calorimeter heretofore employed is that of Hempel, as\r\nmodified by Atwater and Woods.[578]\r\n\r\nA section of this calorimeter, with all the parts in place, is shown in\r\nFig. 120.\r\n\r\nIn the figure the steel cylinder _A_, about 12.5 centimeters deep and\r\n6.2 in diameter, represents the chamber in which the combustion takes\r\nplace. Its walls are about half a centimeter thick and it weighs about\r\nthree kilograms. It is closed, when all the parts are ready and the\r\nsample in place, by the collar _C_, which is secured gas tight by means\r\nof a powerful spanner. The cover is provided with a neck _D_ carrying a\r\nscrew _E_ and a valve screw _F_. In the neck _D_, where the bottom of\r\nthe cylinder screw _E_ rests, is a shoulder fitted with a lead washer.\r\nThrough _G_ the oxygen used for combustion is introduced. The upper\r\nedge of the cylinder _A_ is beveled and fits into a groove in the cover\r\n_B_, carrying a soft metal washer. To facilitate the screwing on of the\r\ncover, ball bearings _KK_, made of hard steel, are introduced between\r\nthe collar and the cover. The platinum wires _H_ and _I_ support the\r\nplatinum crucible holding the combustible bodies which are ignited by\r\nraising the spiral iron wire connecting them to the temperature of\r\nfusion by an electric current. The combustion apparatus when charged is\r\nimmersed in a metal cylinder _M_, containing water and resting on small\r\ncylinders of cork. The water is stirred by the apparatus _LL_. The\r\ncylinder _M_ is contained in two large concentric cylinders, _N_, _O_,\r\nmade of non-conducting materials and covered with disks of hard rubber.\r\nThe space between _O_ and _N_ may be filled with water. The temperature\r\nis measured by the thermometer _P_, graduated to hundredths of a degree\r\nand the reading is best accomplished by means of a cathetometer.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 120. HEMPEL AND ATWATER’S CALORIMETER.]\r\n\r\n=563. The Williams Calorimeter.=—The calorimeter bomb has been\r\nimproved by Williams by making it of aluminum bronze of a spheroidal\r\nshape. The interior of the bomb is plated with gold. By an ingenious\r\narrangement of contacts the firing is secured by means of a permanently\r\ninsulated electrode fixed in the side of the bomb. The calorimetric\r\nwater, as well as that in the insulating vessel, is stirred by means\r\nof an electrical screw so regulated as to produce no appreciable\r\ndegree of heat mechanically. The combustion is started by fusing a\r\nfine platinum wire of definite length and thickness by means of an\r\nelectric current. The heat value of this fusion is determined and the\r\ncalories produced deducted from the total calories of the combustion.\r\nThe valve admitting the oxygen is sealed automatically on breaking\r\nconnection with the oxygen cylinder. The effluent gases, at the end of\r\nthe combustion, may be withdrawn through an alkaline solution and any\r\nnitric acid therein thus be fixed and determined.[579]\r\n\r\n=564. Manipulation and Calculation.=—The material to be burned is\r\nconveniently prepared by pressing it into tablets. The oxygen is\r\nsupplied from cylinders, of which two should be used, one at a pressure\r\nof more than twenty atmospheres. By this arrangement a pump is not\r\nrequired.\r\n\r\nIn practical use, a known weight of the substance to be burned is\r\nplaced in the platinum capsule, the cover of the bomb screwed on, after\r\nall adjustments have been made, and the apparatus immersed in the water\r\ncontained in _M_, which should be about 2° below room temperature. All\r\nthe covers are placed in position and the temperature, of the water in\r\n_M_ begins to rise. Readings of the thermometer are taken at intervals\r\nof about one minute for six minutes, at which time the temperature of\r\nthe bomb and calorimetric water may be regarded as sensibly the same.\r\nThe electric current is turned on, the iron wire at once melts, ignites\r\nthe substance and the combustion rapidly takes place. In the case of\r\nbodies which do not burn readily Atwater adds to them some naphthalene,\r\nthe thermal value of which is previously determined. The calories due\r\nto the combustion of the added naphthalene are deducted from the total\r\ncalories obtained.\r\n\r\nThe temperature of the water in _M_ rises rapidly at first, and\r\nreadings are made at intervals of one minute for five minutes, and then\r\nagain after ten minutes. The first of the initial readings, the one at\r\nthe moment of turning on the current, and the last one mentioned above\r\nare the data from which the correction, made necessary by the influence\r\nof the temperature of the room, is calculated by the following\r\nformulas.[580]\r\n\r\nThe preliminary readings of the thermometer at one minute intervals\r\nare represented by _t_₁, _t_₂, _t_₃ ... _t_ₙ₁. The last observation\r\ntₙ₁ is taken as the beginning temperature of the combustion and is\r\nrepresented in the formulas for calculations by Θ₁. The readings after\r\ncombustion are also made at intervals of one minute, and are designated\r\nby Θ₂, Θ₃ ... Θₙ. The readings are continued until there is no observed\r\nchange between the last two. Generally this is secured by five or six\r\nreadings.\r\n\r\nThe third period of observations begins with the last reading Θₙ, which\r\nin the next series is represented by _tʹ_₁, _tʹ_₂ ... _tʹ_ₙ₂.\r\n\r\nIn order to make the formulas less cumbersome let\r\n\r\n    _t_ₙ₁ - _t_₁\r\n    ------------ = _v_,\r\n       _n_₁ - 1\r\n\r\n    _tʹ_ₙ₁ - _tʹ_₁\r\n    ------------- = _vʹ_,\r\n       _n_₂ - 1\r\n\r\n    _t_₁ + _t_₂ + _t_₃ ... _t_ₙ₁\r\n    --------------------------- = t,\r\n            _n_₁\r\n\r\n         _tʹ_₁ + _tʹ_₂ + _tʹ_₃ ... _tʹ_ₙ₂\r\n    and -------------------------------- = _tʹ_.\r\n                     _n_₂\r\n\r\nThe correction to be made to the difference between Θₙ - Θ₁ for the\r\ninfluence of the outside temperature is determined by the formula of\r\nRegnault-Pfaundler, which is as follows:\r\n\r\n             _v_ - _vʹ_ ⁿ⁻¹              Θₙ + Θ₁\r\n    ∑ Δ_t_ = -------------- ( ∑  Θ_r_ + -------- - _nt_) - (_n_ - 1)_v_,\r\n             _tʹ_ - _t_  ₁                  2\r\n\r\n             ⁿ⁻¹\r\n    in which  ∑ Θ_r_\r\n              ₁\r\n\r\nis calculated from the observation of the thermometer Θ₁, Θ₂ etc.,\r\nmade immediately after the combustion. It is equal to the sum of\r\nobservations Θ₁, Θ₂ etc., increased by an arbitrary factor equivalent\r\nto (Θ₂ - Θ₁)/9, which is made necessary by reason of the irregularity\r\nof the temperature increase during the first minute after combustion,\r\nthe mean temperature during that minute being somewhat higher than the\r\nmean of the temperatures at the commencement and end of that time.\r\n\r\nThe quantity of heat formed by the combustion of the iron wire used for\r\nigniting the sample is to be deducted from the total heat produced.\r\nThis correction may be determined once for all, the weight of the\r\niron wire used being noted and that of any unburned portion being\r\nascertained after the combustion.\r\n\r\nTen milligrams of iron, on complete combustion, will give sixteen\r\ncalories.\r\n\r\nIn the combustion of substances containing nitrogen, or in case the\r\nfree nitrogen of the air be not wholly expelled from the apparatus\r\nbefore the burning, nitric acid is formed which is dissolved by the\r\nwater produced.\r\n\r\nThe heat produced by the solution of nitric acid in water is 14.3\r\ncalories per gram molecule. The quantity of nitric acid formed is\r\ndetermined by titration and a corresponding reduction made in the total\r\ncalculated calories.\r\n\r\nIn the titration of nitric acid it is advisable to make use of an\r\nalkaline solution, of which one liter is equivalent to 4.406 grams of\r\nnitric acid. One cubic centimeter of the reagent is equivalent to a\r\nquantity of nitric acid represented by one calorie.\r\n\r\nSince the materials of which the bomb is composed have a specific heat\r\ndifferent from that of water, it is necessary to compute the water\r\nthermal value of each apparatus.\r\n\r\nThe hydrothermal equivalent of the whole apparatus is most simply\r\ndetermined by immersing it at a given temperature in water of a\r\ndifferent temperature.[581] With small apparatus this method is quite\r\nsufficient, but there are many difficulties attending its application\r\nto large systems weighing several kilograms. In these cases the\r\nhydrothermal equivalent may be calculated from the specific heats of\r\nthe various components of the apparatus.\r\n\r\nIn calculating these values the specific heats of the various\r\ncomponents of the apparatus are as follows:\r\n\r\n    Brass        0.093\r\n    Steel        0.1097\r\n    Platinum     0.0324\r\n    Copper       0.09245\r\n    Lead         0.0315\r\n    Oxygen       0.2389\r\n    Glass        0.190\r\n    Mercury      0.0332\r\n    Hard rubber  0.33125\r\n\r\n_Example._—It is required to calculate the hydrothermal value of a\r\ncalorimeter composed of the following substances:\r\n\r\n                                                            Hydrothermal\r\n                                                               value.\r\n    Steel bomb and cover, 2850 grams × 0.1097              312.65 grams.\r\n    Platinum lining, capsule and wires, 120 grams × 0.0324   3.89   ”\r\n    Lead washer, 100 grams × 0.0315                          3.15   ”\r\n    Brass outer cylinder, 500 grams × 0.093                 46.50   ”\r\n    Mercury in thermometer, 10 grams × 0.0332                0.33   ”\r\n    Glass (part of thermometer in water), 10 grams × 0.19    1.90   ”\r\n    Brass stirring apparatus (part in water), 100 grams\r\n           × 0.093                                           9.30   ”\r\n                                                           ------\r\n        Total water value of system                        377.72   ”\r\n\r\nWhen a bomb of 300 cubic centimeters capacity is filled with oxygen at\r\na pressure of twenty-four atmospheres it will hold about ten grams of\r\nthe gas, equivalent to a water value of 2.40 grams. Hence the water\r\nvalue of the above system when charged, assuming the bomb to be of the\r\ncapacity mentioned, is 380.12 grams.\r\n\r\nIf the cylinder holding the water be made of fiber or other\r\nnon-conducting substance, its specific heat is best determined by\r\nfilling it in a known temperature with water at a definite different\r\ntemperature.\r\n\r\nIt is advisable to have the water cylinder of such a size as to permit\r\nthe use of a quantity of water for the total immersion of the bomb\r\nwhich will weigh, with the water value of the apparatus, an even number\r\nof grams. In the case above, 2622.28 grams of water placed in the\r\ncylinder will make a water value of 3,000 grams, which is one quite\r\nconvenient for calculation.\r\n\r\n=565. Computing the Calories of Combustion.=—In the preceding paragraph\r\nhas been given a brief account of the construction of the calorimeter\r\nand of the methods of standardizing it and securing the necessary\r\ncorrections in the data directly obtained in its use. An illustration\r\nof the details of computing the calories of combustion taken from the\r\npaper of Stohmann, Kleber and Langbein, will be a sufficient guide for\r\nthe analyst in conducting the combustion and in the use of the data\r\nobtained.[582]\r\n\r\nWeight of substance burned, 1.07 grams.\r\n\r\nWater value of system (water + apparatus), 2,500 grams.\r\n\r\nPreliminary thermometric readings, _t_₁ = 26.8; _t_₂ = 27.2; _t_₃ =\r\n27.7; _t_₄ = 28.1; _t_₅ = 28.5; _t_ₙ₁ = 28.9.\r\n\r\nThermometric reading after combustion, Θ₁ = 28.9; Θ₂ = 202; Θ₃ = 213;\r\nΘ₄ = 214.2; Θₙ = 214.0.\r\n\r\nFinal thermometric readings, _tʹ_₁ = 214.0; _tʹ_₂ = 213.8; _tʹ_₃ =\r\n213.6; _tʹ_₄ = 213.5; _tʹ_₅ = 213.3; _tʹ_₆ = 213.1; _tʹ_₇ = 212.9;\r\n_tʹ_₈ = 212.7; _tʹ_₉ = 212.6; _tʹ_₁₀ = 212.4; _tʹ_ₙ₂ = 212.2.\r\n\r\nFrom the formulas given above the following numerical values are\r\ncomputed:\r\n\r\n    _v_ = 0.42.\r\n    _vʹ_ = -0.18.\r\n    _t_ = 27.9.\r\n    _tʹ_ = 213.1.\r\n    _n_ = 5.\r\n\r\n    ⁿ⁻¹                          Θ₂ - Θ₁\r\n    ∑ Θ_r_ = Θ₁ + Θ₂ + Θ₃ + Θ₄ + ------- = 667.\r\n    ₁                               9\r\n\r\nSubstituting these values in the formula of Regnault-Pfaundler, the\r\nvalue of the correction for the influence of the external air is\r\n\r\n             0.42 - (-0.18)         214 + 29\r\n    ∑ Δt = [--------------- (677 + --------- - (5 × 27.9))\r\n               213.1 - 27.9             2\r\n\r\n                                 - (4 × 0.42)] = 0.45,\r\n\r\nwhich is to be added to the end temperature (Θₙ = 214.0).\r\n\r\nThe computation is then made from the following data:\r\n\r\n    Corrected end temperature (Θₙ + 0.45)   214.45 = 15°.3699\r\n    Beginning temperature (Θ₁)               28.90 = 12°.8406\r\n    Increase in temperature                 185.55 =  2°.5293\r\n    Total calories 2.5293 × 25000                  =   6323.3\r\n    Of which there were due to iron burned                9.1\r\n    ”    ”     ”    ”   nitric acid dissolved             8.2\r\n    Total calories due to one gram of substance        5893.5\r\n\r\nThe thermometric readings are given in the divisions of the thermometer\r\nwhich in this case are so adjusted as to have the number 28.90\r\ncorrespond to 12°.8406, and each division is nearly equivalent to\r\n0°.014 thermometric degree.\r\n\r\nThe number of calories above given is the proper one when the\r\ncomputation is made to refer to constant volume. By reason of the\r\nconsumption of oxygen and the change of temperature, although mutually\r\ncompensatory, the pressure may be changed at the end of the operation.\r\nThe conversion of the data obtained at constant volume referred to\r\nconstant pressure may be made by the following formula, in which [_Q_]\r\nrepresents the calories from constant volume and _Q_ the desired data\r\nfor constant pressure, _O_ the number of oxygen atoms, _H_ the number\r\nof hydrogen atoms in a molecule of the substance, and 0.291 a constant\r\nfor a temperature of about 18°, at which the observations should be\r\nmade.\r\n\r\n                 _H_\r\n    _Q_ = [_Q_] + (---  -  _O_) 0.291.\r\n                  2\r\n\r\n=566. Calorimetric Equivalents.=—By the term calorie is understood the\r\nquantity of heat required to raise one gram of water, at an initial\r\ntemperature of about 18°, one degree. The term ‘Calorie’ denotes the\r\nquantity of heat, in like conditions, required to raise one kilogram of\r\nwater one degree.\r\n\r\nFor purposes of comparison and for assisting the analyst in adjusting\r\nhis apparatus so as to give reliable results, the following data,\r\ngiving the calories of some common food materials, are given:\r\n\r\n      Substance.

Distinction between Butter and Oleomargarin.=—Theoretically\r\nthe heats of combustion of butter fat and oleomargarin are different\r\nand de Schweinitz and Emery propose to utilize this difference for\r\nanalytical purposes.[583] The samples of pure butter fat examined by\r\nthem afforded 9320, 9327 and 9362 calories, respectively. The calories\r\nobtained for various samples of oleomargarin varied from 9574 to\r\n9795. On mixing butter fat and oleomargarin, a progressive increase\r\nin calorimetric power is found, corresponding to the percentage of the\r\nlatter constituent. Lards examined at the same time gave from 9503 to\r\n9654 calories.\r\n\r\n\r\nFRUITS, MELONS AND VEGETABLES.\r\n\r\n=568. Preparation of Sample.=—Fresh fruits and vegetables are most\r\neasily prepared for analysis by passing them through the pulping\r\nmachine described on page 9. Preliminary to the pulping they should\r\nbe separated into skins, cores, seeds and edible portions, and the\r\nrespective weights of these bodies noted. Each part is separately\r\nreduced to a pulp and, at once, a small quantity of the well mixed\r\nsubstance placed in a flat bottom dish and dried, first at a low\r\ntemperature, and finally at 100°, or somewhat higher, and the\r\npercentage of water contained in the sample determined. The bulk of\r\nthe sample, three or four kilograms, is dried on a tray of tinned or\r\naluminum wire, first at a low and then at a high temperature, until all\r\nor nearly all the moisture is driven off. The dried pulp is then ground\r\nto as fine a powder as possible and subjected to the ordinary processes\r\nof analysis; _viz._, the determination of the moisture, ash, nitrogen,\r\nfiber, fat and carbohydrates.\r\n\r\nIn this method of analysis it is customary to determine the\r\ncarbohydrates, exclusive of fiber, by subtracting the sum of the per\r\ncents of the other constituents and the nitrogen multiplied by 6.25\r\nfrom 100.\r\n\r\n=569. Separation of the Carbohydrates.=—It is often desirable to\r\ndetermine the relative proportions of the more important carbohydrates\r\nwhich are found in fruits and vegetables. The pentoses and pentosans\r\nare estimated by the method described in paragraph =150=. The cane\r\nsugar, dextrose and levulose are determined by extracting a portion of\r\nthe substance with eighty per cent alcohol and estimating the reducing\r\nsugars in the extract before and after inversion by the processes\r\ndescribed in paragraphs =238-251=. The percentages of sugars deducted\r\nfrom the percentage of carbohydrates, exclusive of fiber, give the\r\nquantity of gums, pentosans, cellulose and pectose bodies present.\r\n\r\nPectose exists chiefly in unripe fruits. By the action of the fruit\r\nacids and of a ferment, pectose, in the process of ripening, is\r\nchanged into pectin and similar hydrolyzed bodies soluble in water.\r\nThe gelatinous properties of boiled fruits and fruit juices are due to\r\nthese bodies, boiling accelerating their formation. In very ripe fruits\r\nthe pectin is completely transformed into pectic acids. The galactan is\r\nestimated as described in =585=.\r\n\r\n=570. Examination of the Fresh Matter.=—To avoid the changes which take\r\nplace in drying fruits and vegetables, it is necessary to examine them\r\nin the fresh state. The samples may be first separated into meat and\r\nwaste, as suggested above, or shredded as a whole. The moisture in the\r\npulp is determined as indicated above, and in a separate portion the\r\nsoluble matters are extracted by repeated treatment with cold water.\r\nThe seeds, skins, cellulose, pectose and other insoluble bodies are\r\nthus separated from the sugars, pectins, pectic and other acids, and\r\nother soluble matters. The insoluble residue is rapidly dried and the\r\nrelative proportions of soluble and insoluble matters determined. The\r\nestimation of these bodies is accomplished in the usual way.\r\n\r\n=571. Examination of Fruit and Vegetable Juices.=—The fruits and\r\nvegetables are pulped, placed in a press and the juices extracted. The\r\npressure should be as strong as possible and the press described in\r\nparagraph =280= is well suited to this purpose. The specific gravity of\r\nthe expressed juice is obtained and the sucrose therein determined by\r\npolarization before and after inversion. The reducing sugars and the\r\nrelative proportions of dextrose and levulose are determined in the\r\nusual manner. In grape juice dextrose is the predominant sugar while in\r\nmany other fruits left hand or optically inactive sugars predominate.\r\nSoluble gums, dextrin, pectin etc., may be separated from the sugars by\r\ncareful precipitation with alcohol, or the total solids, ash, nitrogen,\r\nether extract and acids be determined and the carbohydrates estimated\r\nby difference. From the carbohydrates the total percentage of sugars is\r\ndeducted and the remainder represents the quantity of pectin, gum and\r\nother carbohydrates present.\r\n\r\n=572. Separation of Pectin.=—Pectin exists in considerable quantities\r\nin the juice of ripe fruits (pears) and may be obtained in an\r\napproximately pure state from the juices by first removing proteids\r\nby the careful addition of tannin, throwing out the soluble lime\r\nsalts with oxalic acid and precipitating the pectin with alcohol. On\r\nboiling with water, pectin is converted into parapectin, which gives\r\na precipitate with lead acetate. Boiling with dilute acids converts\r\npectin into metapectin, which is precipitated by a barium salt.\r\n\r\nPectic acid may be obtained by boiling an aqueous extract (carrots)\r\nwith sodium carbonate and precipitating the pectic with hydrochloric\r\nacid. It is a jelly-like body and dries to a horny mass.\r\n\r\n=573. Determination of Free Acid.=—The free acid, or rather total\r\nacidity of fruits, is determined by the titration of their aqueous\r\nextracts or expressed juices with a set alkali. In common fruits and\r\nvegetables the acidity is calculated to malic C₄H₆O₅, in grapes to\r\ntartaric C₄H₆O₆, and in citrous fruits to citric acid C₆H₈O₇. Many\r\nother acids are found in fruits and vegetables, but those mentioned are\r\npredominant in the classes given.\r\n\r\n=574. Composition of Common Fruits.=—The composition of common\r\nfruits in this country has been extensively investigated at the\r\nCalifornia Station and the following data are derived chiefly from its\r\nbulletins.[584]\r\n\r\n        Name.

Dried Fruits.=—A method of preserving fruits largely practiced\r\nconsists in subjecting them, in thin slices or whole, to the action\r\nof hot air until the greater part of the moisture is driven off. The\r\ntechnique of the process is fully described in recent publications.[588]\r\nIt has been shown by Richards that fruit subjected to rapid evaporation\r\nundergoes but little change aside from the loss of water.[589]\r\n\r\nIn the analyses of dried fruits the methods already described are used.\r\nThe presence of pectin renders the filtration of the aqueous extract\r\nsomewhat difficult, and in many cases it is advisable to determine the\r\nsugars present in the extract without previous filtration.\r\n\r\n=577. Zinc in Evaporated Fruits.=—Fruits are commonly evaporated on\r\ntrays made of galvanized iron. In these instances a portion of the zinc\r\nis dissolved by the fruit acids, and will be found as zinc malate etc.,\r\nin the finished product. The presence of zinc salts is objectionable\r\nfor hygienic reasons, and therefore the employment of galvanized trays\r\nshould be discontinued. The presence of zinc in evaporated fruits may\r\nbe detected by the following process.[590] The sample is placed in\r\na large platinum dish and heated slowly until dry and in incipient\r\ncombustion. The flame is removed and the combustion allowed to proceed,\r\nthe lamp being applied from time to time in case the burning ceases.\r\nWhen the mass is burned out it will be found to consist of ash and\r\nchar, which are ground to a fine powder and extracted with hydrochloric\r\nor nitric acid. The residual char is burned to a white ash at a low\r\ntemperature, the ash extracted with acid, the soluble portion added to\r\nthe first extract and the whole filtered. The iron in the filtrate is\r\noxidized by boiling with bromin water and the boiling continued until\r\nthe excess of bromin is removed. A drop of methyl orange is placed in\r\nthe liquid and ammonia added until it is only faintly acid. The iron is\r\nprecipitated by adding fifty cubic centimeters of a solution containing\r\n250 grams of ammonium acetate in a liter and raising the temperature to\r\nabout 80°. The precipitate is separated by filtration and washed with\r\nwater at 80° until free of chlorids. The filtrate is saturated with\r\nhydrogen sulfid, allowed to stand until the zinc sulfid settles and\r\npoured on a close filter. It is often necessary to return the filtrate\r\nseveral times before it becomes limpid. The collected precipitate is\r\nwashed with a saturated solution of hydrogen sulfid containing a little\r\nacetic acid. The precipitate and filter are transferred to a crucible,\r\ndried, ignited and the zinc weighed as oxid. Small quantities of zinc\r\nsalts added to fresh apples which were dried and treated as above\r\ndescribed, were recovered by this method without loss. Other methods of\r\nestimating zinc in dried fruits are given in the bulletin cited.\r\n\r\nEvaporated apples contain a mean content of 23.85 per cent of water and\r\n0.931 per cent of ash.\r\n\r\nThe mean quantity of zinc oxid found in samples of apples dried in\r\nthe United States is ten milligrams for each 100 grams of the fruit,\r\nan amount entirely too small to produce any toxic effects. When zinc\r\nexists in the soil it will be found as a natural constituent in the\r\ncrop.[591]\r\n\r\n=578. Composition of Watermelons and Muskmelons.=—In the examination of\r\nmelons a separation of the rind, seeds and meat is somewhat difficult\r\nof accomplishment, since the line of demarcation is not distinct.\r\nIn watermelons the separation of rind and meat is made at the point\r\nwhere the red color of the meat disappears. In muskmelons no such\r\ndefinite point is found and in the examination of these they are taken\r\nas a whole. The total moisture, ash and nitrogen may be determined\r\nin the whole mass or in the separate portions. The sugars are most\r\nconveniently determined in the expressed juices. The mean composition\r\nof the melons given below is that obtained from analyses made in the\r\nDepartment of Agriculture.[592]\r\n\r\n                  COMPOSITION OF MELONS.\r\n                                             Total\r\n                Total weight,       Juice,   proteids,   Ash,\r\n                   grams.          per cent. per cent. per cent.\r\n    -------------------------------------------------------------\r\n    Watermelons    10330       meat 83.99      6.12      0.37\r\n                               rind 81.02\r\n    -------------------------------------------------------------\r\n    Muskmelons      3407            80.23      6.45      0.57\r\n\r\n                  COMPOSITION OF JUICE.\r\n                      Sucrose in   Reducing sugars      Ash in\r\n                        juice,        in juice,         juice,\r\n                      per cent.       per cent.        per cent.\r\n    -------------------------------------------------------------\r\n    Watermelons   meat  1.92      meat 4.33         meat  0.31\r\n                  rind  0.34      rind 2.47         rind  0.38\r\n    -------------------------------------------------------------\r\n    Muskmelons          1.02           3.04               0.53\r\n\r\n\r\nTEA AND COFFEE.\r\n\r\n=579. Special Analysis.=—Aside from the examination of teas and coffees\r\nfor adulterants, the only special determinations which are required\r\nin analyses are the estimation of the alkaloid (caffein) and of the\r\ntannin contained therein. It is chiefly to the alkaloid that the\r\nstimulating effects of the beverages made from tea and coffee are due.\r\nThe determination of the quantity of tannin contained in tea and coffee\r\nis accomplished by the processes described under the chapter devoted to\r\nthat glucosid.\r\n\r\nThe general analysis, _viz._, the estimation of water, ether extract,\r\ntotal nitrogen, fiber, carbohydrates and ash, with the exceptions noted\r\nabove, is conducted by the methods which have already been given.\r\n\r\nFor detailed instructions concerning the detection of adulterants of\r\ntea and coffee the bulletins of the Chemical Division, Department of\r\nAgriculture, may be consulted.[593]\r\n\r\n=580. Estimation of Caffein= (=Thein=).—The method adopted by Spencer,\r\nafter a thorough trial of all the usual processes for estimating this\r\nalkaloid, is as follows:[594] To three grams of the finely powdered tea\r\nor coffee, in a 300 cubic centimeter flask, add about a quarter of a\r\nliter of water, slowly heat to the boiling point, using a fragment of\r\ntallow to prevent frothing, and boil gently for half an hour. When\r\nboiling begins, the flask should be nearly filled with hot water\r\nand more added from time to time to compensate for the loss due to\r\nevaporation. After cooling, add a strong solution of basic lead acetate\r\nuntil no further precipitation is produced, complete the volume to the\r\nmark with water, mix and throw on a filter. Precipitate the lead from\r\nthe filtrate by hydrogen sulfid and filter. Boil a measured volume of\r\nthis filtrate to expel the excess of hydrogen sulfid, cool and add\r\nsufficient water to compensate for the evaporation. Transfer fifty\r\ncubic centimeters of this solution to a separatory funnel and shake\r\nseven times with chloroform. Collect the chloroform solution in a tared\r\nflask and remove the solvent by gentle distillation. A safety bulb,\r\nsuch as is used in the kjeldahl nitrogen method, should be employed to\r\nprevent entrainment of caffein with the chloroform vapors.\r\n\r\nThe extraction with chloroform is nearly complete after shaking out\r\nfour times; a delicate test, however, will usually reveal the presence\r\nof caffein in the watery residue even after five or six extractions,\r\nhence seven extractions are recommended for precautionary reasons. The\r\nresidual caffein is dried at 75° for two hours and weighed.\r\n\r\nThe principal objection which has been made to Spencer’s method is\r\nthat the boiling with water is not continued for a sufficient length\r\nof time. For the water extraction, Allen prescribes at least six hours\r\ncohobation.[595] In this method six grams of the powdered substance\r\nare boiled with half a liter of water for six hours in a flask, with\r\na condenser, the decoction filtered, the volume of the filtrate\r\ncompleted to 600 cubic centimeters with the wash water, heated to\r\nboiling, and four cubic centimeters of strong lead acetate solution\r\nadded, the mixture boiled for ten minutes, filtered and half a liter\r\nof the filtrate evaporated to fifty cubic centimeters. The excess of\r\nlead is removed with sodium phosphate and the filtrate and washings\r\nconcentrated to about forty cubic centimeters. The caffein is removed\r\nby shaking four times with chloroform. Older but less desirable\r\nprocesses are fully described by Allen.[596]\r\n\r\nIn France this method is known as the process of Petit and Legrip, and\r\nit has been worked out in great detail by Grandval and Lajoux and by\r\nPetit and Terbat.[597]\r\n\r\n=581. Estimation of Caffein by Precipitation with Iodin.=—The caffein\r\nin this method is extracted, the extract clarified by lead acetate and\r\nthe excess of lead removed as in Spencer’s process described above. The\r\ncaffein is determined in the acidified aqueous solution thus prepared,\r\naccording to the plan proposed by Gomberg, as follows:[598]\r\n\r\nDefinite volumes of the aqueous solution of the caffein are acidulated\r\nwith sulfuric and the alkaloid precipitated by an excess of a set\r\nsolution of iodin in potassium iodid. After filtering, the excess of\r\niodin in an aliquot part of the filtrate is determined by titration\r\nwith a tenth normal solution of sodium thiosulfate. The filtration of\r\nthe iodin liquor is accomplished on glass wool or asbestos. The results\r\nof the analyses are calculated from the composition of the precipitated\r\ncaffein periodid; _viz._, C₈H₁₀N₄O₂.HI.I₄. The weight of the alkaloid\r\nis calculated from the amount of iodin required for the precipitation\r\nby the equation 4I: C₈H₁₀N₄O₂ = 508: 194. From this equation it is\r\nshown that one part of iodin is equivalent to 0.3819 part of caffein,\r\nor one cubic centimeter of tenth normal iodin solution is equal to\r\n0.00485 gram of iodin.\r\n\r\nIn practice, it is recommended to divide the aqueous extract of the\r\nalkaloid, prepared as directed above, into two portions, one of which\r\nis treated with the iodin reagent without further preparation, and\r\nthe other after acidulation with sulfuric. After ten minutes, the\r\nresidual iodin is estimated in each of the solutions as indicated\r\nabove. The one portion, containing only the acetic acid resulting from\r\nthe decomposition of the lead acetate, serves to indicate whether\r\nthe aqueous solution of the caffein contains other bodies than that\r\nalkaloid capable of forming a precipitate with the reagent, since the\r\ncaffein itself is not precipitated even in presence of strong acetic\r\nacid.\r\n\r\nIn the solution acidulated with sulfuric, the caffein, together with\r\nthe other bodies capable of combining with iodin, is precipitated. The\r\nresidual iodin is determined in each case, and thus the quantity which\r\nis united with the caffein is easily ascertained. The weight of iodin\r\nwhich has entered into the precipitated caffein periodid multiplied by\r\n0.3819 gives the weight of the caffein in the solution.\r\n\r\nGomberg’s method has been subjected to a careful comparative study by\r\nSpencer and has been much improved by him in important particulars.[599]\r\n\r\nIt is especially necessary to secure the complete expulsion of\r\nthe hydrogen sulfid and to observe certain precautions in the\r\naddition of the iodin reagent. The precipitation should be made in a\r\nglass-stoppered flask, shaking thoroughly after the addition of the\r\niodin and collecting the precipitate on a gooch. As thus modified, the\r\niodin process gives results comparable with those obtained by Spencer’s\r\nmethod, and it can also be used to advantage in estimating caffein in\r\nheadache tablets in the presence of acetanilid.\r\n\r\n=582. Freeing Caffein of Chlorophyll.=—Any chlorophyll which may pass\r\ninto solution and be found in the caffein may be removed by dissolving\r\nthe caffein in ten per cent sulfuric acid, filtering, neutralizing\r\nwith ammonia and evaporating to dryness. The residue is taken up with\r\nchloroform, the chloroform removed at a low temperature and the pure\r\ncaffein thus obtained.[600]\r\n\r\n=583. Proteid Nitrogen.=—The proteid nitrogen in tea and coffee may be\r\ndetermined in the residue after extraction of the alkaloid by boiling\r\nwater as described above. More easily it is secured by determining\r\nthe total nitrogen in the sample and deducting therefrom the nitrogen\r\npresent as caffein. The remainder, multiplied by 6.25, will give the\r\nquantity of proteid matter.\r\n\r\n=584. Carbohydrates of the Coffee Bean.=—The carbohydrates of the\r\ncoffee bean include those common to vegetable substances; _viz._,\r\ncellulose, pentosan bodies (xylan, araban), fiber etc., together\r\nwith certain sugars, of which sucrose is pointed out by Ewell as the\r\nchief.[601] In smaller quantities are found a galactose yielding body\r\n(galactan), as pointed out by Maxwell, a dextrinoid and a trace of a\r\nsugar reducing alkaline copper solution.\r\n\r\nThe sucrose may be separated from the coffee bean by the following\r\nprocess:[602] The finely ground flour is extracted with seventy per\r\ncent alcohol, the extract clarified with lead acetate, filtered, the\r\nlead removed from the filtrate with hydrogen sulfid, the excess of the\r\ngas removed by boiling, the filtrate evaporated in a partial vacuum to\r\na sirup and the sucrose crystallized from a solution of the sirup in\r\nalcohol.\r\n\r\nFor a quantitive determination, ten grams of the coffee flour are\r\nextracted with ether and the residue with seventy-five per cent\r\nalcohol. This process, conducted in a continuous extraction apparatus,\r\nshould be continued for at least twenty-four hours. The alcohol is\r\nremoved by evaporation, the residue dissolved in water, clarified with\r\nbasic lead acetate, filtered, the precipitate washed, the lead removed,\r\nagain filtered, the filtrate washed and wash water and filtrate\r\nmade to a definite volume. In an aliquot part of this solution the\r\nsugars are determined by the alkaline copper method, both before and\r\nafter inversion. From the data obtained the percentage of sucrose is\r\ncalculated.\r\n\r\nIn a coffee examined by Ewell the percentage of sucrose was found to be\r\n6.34. The pentose yielding constituents of the coffee bean amount to\r\nfrom eight to ten per cent.\r\n\r\nWhen coffee meal is extracted with a five per cent solution of sodium\r\ncarbonate, a gummy substance is obtained, which is precipitable by\r\nalcohol. This gum, after washing with hydrochloric acid containing\r\nalcohol, gives a gray, translucent, hard mass on drying. On hydrolysis\r\nit yielded 75.2 per cent of dextrose, on distillation with hydrochloric\r\nacid, thirteen per cent of furfuraldehyd and, on oxidation with nitric\r\nacid, 18.7 per cent of mucic acid. This gum, therefore, consists\r\nchiefly of a mixture of galactan, xylan and araban.\r\n\r\n=585. Estimation of Galactan.=—From three to five grams of the\r\nsubstance supposed to contain galactan are placed in a beaker with\r\nsixty cubic centimeters of nitric acid of 1.15 specific gravity. The\r\nmixture is evaporated on a steam bath until it is reduced to one-third\r\nof its original volume, allowed to stand for twenty-four hours, ten\r\ncubic centimeters of water added, well stirred and again allowed\r\nto stand for twenty-four hours, until the mucic acid is separated\r\nin a crystalline form. To remove impurities from the mucic acid it\r\nis separated by filtration, washed with not to exceed twenty cubic\r\ncentimeters of water, placed together with the filter in the beaker,\r\nfrom twenty-five to thirty cubic centimeters of ammonium carbonate\r\nsolution, containing one part of dry ammonium carbonate, nineteen\r\nparts of water and one part of ammonium hydroxid, added and heated to\r\nnear the boiling point. The mucic acid is dissolved by the ammonium\r\ncarbonate solution and any insoluble impurity separated by filtration,\r\nthe filtrate being received in a platinum dish, the residue well washed\r\nand the entire filtrate and wash water evaporated to dryness on a steam\r\nbath acidified with dilute nitric, well stirred and allowed to stand\r\nuntil the mucic acid separates in a crystalline form. The separation\r\nis usually accomplished in half an hour, after which time the crystals\r\nof mucic acid are collected on a tared filter, or gooch, and washed\r\nwith not to exceed fifteen cubic centimeters of water followed with\r\nsixty cubic centimeters of alcohol, then with ether, dried at 100°\r\nand weighed. For computing the amount of galactose, one gram of the\r\nmucic acid is equal to 1.333 of galactose and one gram of galactose is\r\nequal to nine-tenths gram of galactan. Before the commencement of the\r\noperation, the material should be freed of fatty matters in the case of\r\noily seeds and other substances similar thereto.[603]\r\n\r\n=586. Revised Factors for Pentosans.=—The factors given in paragraph\r\n=154= have lately been recalculated by Mann, Kruger and Tollens, and\r\nas a result of their investigations the following factors are now\r\nrecommended.[604] The quantity of furfurol is derived from the weight of\r\nfurfurolhydrazone obtained by the formula:\r\n\r\n    1. Furfurolhydrazone × 0.516 + 0.0104 = furfurol.\r\n    2. Furfurol × 1.84 = pentosans.\r\n    3. Furfurol × 1.64 = xylan.\r\n    4. Furfurol × 2.02 = araban.\r\n\r\nThe pentoses (xylose, arabinose) may be calculated from the pentosans\r\n(xylan, araban) by dividing by 0.88.\r\n\r\nThe method of procedure preferred for the estimation of the pentosans\r\nis that described in paragraph =157=. The phloroglucin is dissolved in\r\nhydrochloric acid of 1.06 specific gravity before it is added to the\r\nfurfurol distillate. The latest factor for converting the phloroglucid\r\nobtained into furfurol is to divide by 1.82 for small quantities and\r\n1.93 for large quantities. After the furfurol is obtained, the factors\r\ngiven above are applied.\r\n\r\n=587. Application of Roentgen Rays to Analysis.=—The detection of\r\nmineral matters in vegetable substances by roentgen photography has\r\nbeen proposed by Ranvez.[605] This process will prove extremely valuable\r\nin detecting the lacing of teas with mineral substances. Practically,\r\nit has been applied by Ranvez in the detection of mineral substances\r\nmixed with saffron with fraudulent intent.\r\n\r\nBarium sulfate is often mixed with saffron for the purpose of\r\nincreasing its weight. Pure saffron and adulterated samples are\r\nenclosed in capsules of black paper and exposed on the same sensitive\r\nplate for a definite time to the rays emanating from a crookes tube.\r\nIn this case the pure saffron forms only a very faint shadow in the\r\ndeveloped negative, while the parts to which barium sulfate are\r\nattached produce strong shadows. The principle involved is applicable\r\nto a wide range of analytical research.\r\n\r\n\r\nTANNINS AND ALLIED BODIES.\r\n\r\n=588. Occurrence and Composition.=—The tannins and allied bodies,\r\nwhich are of importance in this connection, are those which occur in\r\nfood products and beverages and also those made use of in the leather\r\nindustry. The term tannin is applied to a large class of astringent\r\nsubstances, many of which are glucosids. Tannic acid is the chief\r\nconstituent of the tannins, and is found in a state of comparative\r\npurity in nutgalls. The source from which the tannic acid is derived is\r\nindicated by a prefix to the name, _e. g._, gallotannic, from nutgalls,\r\nand caffetannic, from coffee etc. The tannins have lately been the\r\ntheme of a critical study by Trimble, and the reader is referred to\r\nhis work for an exhaustive study of the subject.[606] Tannin is one of\r\nthe most widely diffused compounds, occurring in hundreds of plants.\r\nCommercially, the oaks and hemlocks are the most important plants\r\ncontaining tannin. The sumach, mangrove, canaigre, palmetto and many\r\nothers have also been utilized as commercial sources of tannin. The\r\ntannins as a class are amorphous and odorless. They are slightly acid\r\nand strongly astringent. Their colors vary from dark brown to pure\r\nwhite. They are soluble in water, alcohol, ether and glycerol and\r\ninsoluble in chloroform, benzol, petroleum ether, carbon bisulfid and\r\nthe oils. The tannins give blue or green precipitates with iron salts\r\nand most of them brown precipitates with potassium bichromate. They are\r\nall precipitated by gelatin or albumin. Tannins are not only generally\r\nof a glucosidal nature, but are found quite constantly associated with\r\nreducing sugars, or in unstable combination therewith.\r\n\r\nThe reducing sugars may be separated from the tannin by precipitating\r\nthe latter with lead acetate and determining the glucose in the\r\nfiltrate after the removal of the lead. A separate portion of the\r\ntannin is hydrolyzed with sulfuric or hydrochloric acid and the\r\nreducing sugars again determined. Any excess of sugars over the first\r\ndetermination is due to the hydrolysis of the tannin glucosid.\r\n\r\n=589. Detection and Estimation of Tannins.=—The qualitive reactions\r\nabove mentioned serve to detect the presence of a tannin. Of the iron\r\nsalts ferric acetate or chlorid is preferred. Ferrous salts do not\r\ngive any reaction with dilute tannin solutions. An ammoniacal solution\r\nof potassium ferricyanid forms with tannins a deep red color changing\r\nto brown. In quantitive work the tannins are mostly determined by\r\nprecipitation with metallic salts, by treatment with gelatin or hide\r\npowder, or by oxidation with potassium permanganate. Directions for the\r\nestimation of glucosids in general are found in Dragendorff’s book.[607]\r\n\r\n=590. Precipitation with Metallic Salts.=—The methods depending on\r\nprecipitation of the tannins with metallic salts are but little used\r\nand only one of them will be mentioned here. A full description of\r\nthe others is contained in Trimble’s book.[608] A method for the\r\ndetermination of caffetannic acid in coffee has been worked out by Krug\r\nand used with some satisfaction.[609]\r\n\r\nIn this method two grams of the coffee meal are digested for thirty-six\r\nhours with ten cubic centimeters of water, a little more than twice\r\nthat volume of ninety-five per cent alcohol added and the digestion\r\ncontinued for a day. The contents of the flask are poured on a filter\r\nand the residue washed with alcohol. The filtrate contains tannin,\r\ncaffetannic acid and traces of coloring matter and fat. It is heated\r\nto the boiling point and clarified with a solution of lead acetate.\r\nA caffetannate of lead containing forty-nine per cent of the metal\r\nis precipitated. As soon as the precipitate has become flocculent it\r\nis collected on a filter, washed with ninety per cent alcohol until\r\nthe soluble lead salts are all removed, then with ether and dried.\r\nThe composition of the precipitate is represented by the formula\r\nPb₃(C₁₅H₁₅O₈)₂. The caffetannic acid is calculated by the equation:\r\nWeight of precipitate: weight of caffetannic acid = 1267: 652.\r\n\r\n=591. The Gelatin Method.=—The precipitation of tannin with gelatin is\r\nthe basis of a process for its quantitive estimation which, according\r\nto Trimble, is conducted as follows:[610] Two and a half grams of\r\ngelatin and ten grams of alum are dissolved in water and the volume of\r\nthe solution made up to one liter. The solution of gelatin and also\r\nthat of the tannin are heated to 70° and the tannin is precipitated\r\nby adding the gelatin reagent slowly, with constant stirring, until\r\nthe precipitate coagulates, and, on settling, leaves a clear liquor in\r\nwhich no further precipitate is produced on adding a few drops more\r\nof the reagent. In case the clearing of the mixture do not take place\r\nreadily, the process should be repeated with a more dilute tannin\r\nsolution. The precipitate is collected on two counterpoised filter\r\npapers one placed inside the other, dried at 110° and weighed, the\r\nempty filter paper being placed on the pan with the weights. For pure\r\ntannin (gallotannic acid) fifty-four per cent of the weight of the\r\nprecipitate are tannin. Ammonium chlorid and common salt have been used\r\nin place of the alum in preparing the reagent, but if the proportion of\r\nalum mentioned above be used, satisfactory results will be obtained in\r\nmost cases.\r\n\r\n=592. The Hide Powder Method.=—The principle of this method is based on\r\nthe change in specific gravity, _i. e._, total solids, which a tannin\r\nsolution will undergo when brought into contact with raw hides in a\r\nstate of fine subdivision. The hide powder absorbs the tannin, and the\r\ntotal solid content of the solution is correspondingly diminished. The\r\nmethod is conducted according to the official directions as follows:[611]\r\n\r\n_Preparation of the Sample._—The bark, wood, leaves or other materials\r\nholding the tannins, are dried and ground to a fine powder and\r\nthoroughly extracted with water as mentioned below. In each case the\r\nsolution or extraction is made as thorough as possible and the volume\r\nof the extract is made up to a definite amount.\r\n\r\n_Quantity of Tanning Material._—Use such an amount of the tanning\r\nmaterial as shall give in 100 cubic centimeters of the filtered\r\nsolution about one gram of dry solids. In the case of barks, woods,\r\nleaves and similar materials, transfer to a half liter flask, fill\r\nthe flask with water at approximately 80° and let stand over night in\r\na bath which is kept at 80°, cool, fill to the mark, shake well and\r\nfilter. In the case of extracts and sweet liquors, wash the proper\r\nquantity into a half liter flask with water at approximately 80°,\r\nalmost filling the flask, cool and fill to the mark.\r\n\r\n_Determination of Moisture._—Dry five grams of the sample in a flat\r\nbottom dish at the temperature of boiling water until the weight\r\nbecomes constant.\r\n\r\n_Determination of Total Solids._—Shake the solution, which should\r\nbe at a temperature of about 20°, and immediately remove 100 cubic\r\ncentimeters with a pipette, evaporate in a weighed dish and dry to\r\nconstant weight at the temperature of boiling water.\r\n\r\n_Determination of Soluble Solids._—Filter a portion of the solution\r\nthrough a folded filter, returning the filtrate to the filter twice\r\nand adding a teaspoonful of kaolin, if necessary. Evaporate 100 cubic\r\ncentimeters of the filtrate and dry as above.\r\n\r\n_Determination of Tanning Substances._—Extract twenty grams of hide\r\npowder by shaking for five minutes with 250 cubic centimeters of water,\r\nfilter through well washed muslin or linen, repeat the operation three\r\ntimes and dry as much as possible in a suitable press. Weigh the wet\r\npowder and determine the residual moisture in about one-fourth of the\r\nwhole by drying to constant weight at 100°. Shake 200 cubic centimeters\r\nof the unfiltered solution of the tannin with the rest of the moist\r\nhide powder for about five minutes, add five grams of barium sulfate,\r\nshake for one minute and filter through a schleicher and schüll folded\r\nfilter, No. 590, fifteen centimeters in diameter, returning the first\r\ntwenty-five cubic centimeters of the filtrate. Evaporate 100 cubic\r\ncentimeters of the clear filtrate and dry the residue to constant\r\nweight at a temperature of boiling water. The difference between the\r\nsoluble solids obtained in the filtered tannin solution and the residue\r\nas obtained above is the amount of tanning material absorbed by the\r\nhide powder. This weight must be corrected for the water retained by\r\nthe hide powder. The shaking must be conducted by means of a mechanical\r\nshaker, in order to remove all the tannin substance from the solution.\r\nThe simple machine used by druggists, and known as the milkshake, is\r\nrecommended.\r\n\r\n_Testing the Hide Powder._—Shake ten grams of the hide powder with 200\r\ncubic centimeters of water for five minutes, filter through muslin\r\nor linen, squeeze out thoroughly by hand, replace the residue in the\r\nflask and repeat the operation twice with the same quantity of water.\r\nPass the last filtrate through paper until a perfectly clear liquid is\r\nobtained. Evaporate 100 cubic centimeters of the final filtrate in a\r\nweighed dish, dry at 100° until the weight is constant. If the residue\r\namount to more than ten milligrams the sample should be rejected. The\r\nhide powder must be kept in a dry place and tested once a month.\r\n\r\nPrepare a solution of pure gallotannic acid by dissolving five grams in\r\none liter of water. Determine the total solids by evaporating 100 cubic\r\ncentimeters of this solution and drying to constant weight. Treat 200\r\ncubic centimeters of the solution with hide powder exactly as described\r\nabove. The hide powder must absorb at least ninety-five per cent of\r\nthe total solids present. The gallotannic acid used must be completely\r\nsoluble in water, alcohol, acetone and acetic ether and should contain\r\nnot more than one per cent of substances not removed by digesting with\r\nexcess of yellow mercuric oxid on the steam bath for two hours.\r\n\r\n_Testing the Non-Tannin Filtrate. For Tannin_:—Test a small portion\r\nof the clear non-tannin filtrate with a few drops of a ten per cent\r\nsolution of gelatin. A cloudiness indicates the presence of tannin, in\r\nwhich case the determination must be repeated, using twenty-five grams\r\nof hide powder instead of twenty grams.\r\n\r\n_For Soluble Hide_:—To a small portion of the clear non-tannin\r\nfiltrate, add a few drops of the original solution, previously filtered\r\nto remove reds. A cloudiness indicates the presence of soluble hide\r\ndue to incomplete washing of the hide powder. In this case, repeat the\r\ndetermination with perfectly washed hide powder.\r\n\r\n=593. The Permanganate Gelatin Method.=—This process, which is\r\nessentially the method of Löwenthal, as improved by Councler, Schroeder\r\nand Proctor and as used by Spencer for the determination of tannin in\r\nteas, is conducted as described below.[612] The principle of the process\r\nis based on the oxidation of all bodies in solution oxidizable by\r\npotassium permanganate, the subsequent precipitation of the tannin by\r\na gelatin solution, and the final oxidation, by means of permanganate,\r\nof the remaining organic bodies. The difference between the total\r\noxidizable matter and that left after the precipitation of the tannin\r\nrepresents the tannin originally in solution.\r\n\r\n_Reagents Required._—The following reagents are necessary to the proper\r\nconduct of the potassium permanganate process:\r\n\r\n(1). Potassium permanganate solution containing about one and a third\r\ngrams of the salt in a liter:\r\n\r\nThe potassium permanganate solution is set by titration against the\r\ndecinormal oxalic acid solution mentioned below. The end reaction with\r\nthe indicator must be of the same tint in all the titrations, _i. e._,\r\neither golden yellow or pink.\r\n\r\n(2). Tenth-normal oxalic acid solution for determining the exact titer\r\nof the permanganate solution:\r\n\r\n(3). Indigo-carmin solution to be used as an indicator and containing\r\nsix grams of indigo-carmin and fifty cubic centimeters of sulfuric\r\nacid in a liter. The indigo-carmin must be very pure and quite free of\r\nindigo-blue.\r\n\r\n(4). Gelatin solution, prepared by digesting twenty-five grams of\r\ngelatin at room temperature for one hour in a saturated solution of\r\nsodium chlorid, then heating until solution is complete, cooling and\r\nmaking the volume up to one liter:\r\n\r\n(5). A salt acid solution, made by adding to 975 cubic centimeters of\r\na saturated solution of sodium chlorid, enough strong sulfuric acid to\r\nbring the volume of the mixture to one liter:\r\n\r\n(6). Powdered kaolin for promoting filtration.\r\n\r\n_The Process._—Five grams of the finely powdered tea (or other\r\nvegetable substance containing tannin) are boiled with distilled water\r\nin a flask of half a liter capacity for half an hour. The distilled\r\nwater should be at room temperature when poured over the powdered tea.\r\nAfter cooling, the volume of the decoction is completed to half a\r\nliter, and the contents of the flask poured on a filter. To ten cubic\r\ncentimeters of the filtered tea infusion are added two and a half times\r\nas much of the indigo-carmin solution and about three-quarters of a\r\nliter of distilled water.\r\n\r\nThe permanganate solution is run in from a burette, a little at a time,\r\nwith vigorous stirring, until the color changes to a light green, and\r\nthen drop by drop until the final color selected for the end of the\r\nreaction, golden yellow or faint pink, is obtained. The number of cubic\r\ncentimeters of permanganate required is noted and represented by a in\r\nthe formula below. The titration should be made in triplicate and the\r\nmean of the two more nearly agreeing readings taken as the correct one.\r\n\r\nOne hundred cubic centimeters of the filtered tea infusion, obtained\r\nas directed above, are mixed with half that quantity of the gelatin\r\nreagent, the first named quantity of the acid salt solution added,\r\ntogether with ten grams of the powdered kaolin, the mixture well\r\nshaken for several minutes and poured on a filter. Twenty-five cubic\r\ncentimeters of the filtrate, corresponding to ten of the original\r\ntea solution are titrated with the permanganate reagent, under the\r\nconditions given above, and the reading of the burette made and\r\nrepresented by _b_. The quantity of permanganate solution, _viz._, _c_,\r\nrequired to oxidize the tannin is calculated from the formula _a - b_ =\r\n_c_. The relation between the permanganate, oxalic acid and tannin is\r\nsuch that 0.04157 gram of gallotannic acid is equivalent to 0.063 gram\r\nof oxalic acid. The relation between the oxalic acid solution and the\r\npermanganate having been previously determined the data for calculating\r\nthe quantity of tannin, estimated as gallotannic acid, are at hand.\r\n\r\n=594. The Permanganate Hide Powder Method.=—Instead of throwing out the\r\ntannin with gelatin it may be absorbed by hide powder. The principle of\r\nthe process, save this modification, is the same as in the method just\r\ndescribed. As described by Trimble, the analysis is conducted according\r\nto the following directions:[613]\r\n\r\n_Reagents Required._—The reagents required for conducting the\r\npermanganate hide powder process are as follows:\r\n\r\n1. _Permanganate Solution._—Ten grams of pure potassium permanganate\r\nare dissolved in six liters of water. The solution is standardized with\r\npure tannin. The moisture in the pure tannin is determined by drying at\r\n100° to constant weight and then a quantity of the undried substance,\r\nrepresenting two grams of the dried material, is dissolved in one\r\nliter of water. Ten cubic centimeters of this solution and double\r\nthat quantity of the indigo solution to be described below, are mixed\r\nwith three-quarters of a liter of water and the permanganate solution\r\nadded from a burette with constant stirring until the liquid assumes\r\na greenish color and then, drop by drop, until a pure yellow color\r\nwith a pinkish rim is obtained. Fifty cubic centimeters of the pure\r\ntannin solution are digested, with frequent shaking, with three grams\r\nof hide powder which has been previously well moistened and dried in a\r\npress for eighteen or twenty hours, the contents of the flask thrown\r\non a filter and ten cubic centimeters of the filtrate titrated with\r\nthe permanganate solution as directed above. The difference between\r\nthe amount of permanganate solution required for the first and second\r\ntitrations represents the amount of pure tannin or oxidizable matter\r\nremoved by the hide powder.\r\n\r\n2. _Indigo Solution._—The indicator which is used in the titrations\r\nis prepared by dissolving thirty grams of sodium sulfindigotate in\r\nthree liters of dilute sulfuric acid made by adding one volume of the\r\nstrong acid to three volumes of water. The solution is shaken for a few\r\nminutes, thrown upon a filter and the insoluble residue washed with\r\nsufficient water to make the volume of the filtrate six liters.\r\n\r\n3. _Hide Powder._—The hide powder used should be white, wooly in\r\ncharacter and sufficiently well extracted with water to afford no other\r\nextract capable of oxidizing the permanganate solution.\r\n\r\n_The Process._—The reagents having been prepared and tested as above,\r\nthe solution of the substance containing the tannin, prepared as\r\ndescribed further on, is titrated first with the permanganate solution\r\nin the manner already given. Fifty cubic centimeters of the tannin\r\nsolution are then shaken, from, time to time for eighteen hours,\r\nwith three grams of hide powder, thrown upon a filter and ten cubic\r\ncentimeters of the filtrate titrated with the potassium permanganate as\r\nabove described. From the data obtained, the quantity of permanganate\r\nsolution corresponding to the tannin removed by the hide powder is\r\neasily calculated. The value of the permanganate solution having been\r\npreviously set with a pure tannin, renders easy of calculation the\r\ncorresponding amount of pure tannin in the solution under examination.\r\n\r\n=595. Preparation of the Tannin Infusion.=—A sample weighing about a\r\nkilogram should be secured, representing as nearly as possible the\r\nwhole of the materials containing tannin in a given lot. The sample\r\nis reduced to a fine powder and passed through a sieve containing\r\napertures about a millimeter in diameter. The quantity of the sample\r\nused for the extraction depends largely upon its content of tannin.\r\nFive grams of nutgalls, ten grams of sumach or twenty grams of oak\r\nbark represent about the quantities necessary for these classes of\r\ntannin-holding materials. The sample is boiled for half an hour with\r\nhalf a liter of water, filtered through a linen bag into a liter flask\r\nand washed and pressed with enough water to make the volume of the\r\nfiltrate equal to one liter. The proper quantities of this solution are\r\nused for the analytical processes described above.\r\n\r\n\r\nTOBACCO.\r\n\r\n=596. Fermented and Unfermented Tobacco.=—Samples of tobacco may\r\nreach the analyst either in the fermented or unfermented state. As a\r\nbasis for comparison, it is advisable in all cases to determine the\r\nconstituents of the sample before fermentation sets in. The analysis,\r\nafter fermentation is complete, will then show the changes of a\r\nchemical nature which it has undergone during the process of curing and\r\nsweating. Only tobacco which has undergone fermentation is found to be\r\nin a suitable condition for consumption. In addition to the natural\r\nconstituents of tobacco, it may contain, in the manufactured state,\r\nflavoring ingredients such as licorice and sugar, coloring matters and\r\nin some instances, it is said, opium or other stimulating drugs. It\r\nis believed, however, that opium is not often found in manufactured\r\ntobacco, and it has never been found in this laboratory in cigarettes,\r\nalthough all the standard brands have been examined for it.[614]\r\n\r\nIn researches made at the Connecticut Station it is shown that\r\nfermentation produces but little change in the relative quantities\r\nof nitric acid, ammonia, fiber and starch in the leaves, while those\r\nof nicotin, albuminoids and amids are diminished. This is not in\r\nharmony with the generally accepted theory that starch is inverted and\r\nfermented during the process.[615]\r\n\r\nThe nature of the ferments which are active in producing the changes\r\nwhich tobacco undergoes in curing, is not definitely understood. Some\r\nof the organic constituents of the tobacco undergo a considerable\r\nchange during the process. Any sugar which is found in the freshly\r\ncured leaves disappears wholly or in part. As products of fermentation\r\nmay also be found succinic, fumaric, formic, acetic, propionic and\r\nbutyric acids.\r\n\r\n=597. Acid and Basic Constituents of Tobacco.=—In unfermented and\r\nfermented tobacco are found certain organic acids, among the most\r\nimportant of which are citric, malic, oxalic, pectic and tannic. Of\r\nthe inorganic acids the chief which are found are nitric, sulfuric\r\nand hydrochloric. Among the bases ammonia and nicotin are the most\r\nimportant. Ammonia is found in the unfermented tobacco in only small\r\nquantities, but in the fermented product it may sometimes reach as high\r\nas half a per cent. The presence of these two nitrogenous bases in\r\ntobacco renders the estimation of the proteid matter contained therein\r\nsomewhat tedious and difficult.\r\n\r\n=598. Composition of Tobacco Ash.=—The mineral constituents of tobacco\r\nare highly important from a commercial point of view. The burning\r\nproperties of tobacco depend largely upon the nature of its mineral\r\nconstituents. A sample containing a large quantity of chlorids\r\nburns much less freely than one in which the sulfates and nitrates\r\npredominate. For this reason, the use of potash fertilizers containing\r\nlarge amounts of chlorin is injudicious in tobacco culture, the\r\ncarbonates and sulfates of potash being preferred. The leaves of the\r\ntobacco plant contain a much larger percentage of mineral constituents\r\nthan the stems, their respective contents of pure ash, that is ash free\r\nfrom carbon dioxid, carbon and sand, being about seventeen and seven.\r\nThe pure ash of the leaves has the following mean composition: Potash\r\n29.1 per cent, soda 3.2 per cent, lime 36.0 per cent, magnesia 7.4 per\r\ncent, iron oxid 2.0 per cent, phosphoric acid 4.7 per cent, sulfuric\r\nacid 6.0 per cent, silica 5.8 per cent, and chlorin 6.7 per cent.[616]\r\n\r\n=599. Composition of Tobacco.=—The mean composition of some of the more\r\nimportant varieties of water-free tobacco is shown in the following\r\ntable:[617]\r\n\r\n                               Havana,  Sumatra,  Kentucky,   Java,\r\n                              per cent. per cent. per cent. per cent.\r\n    Nicotin                     3.98       2.38      4.59      3.30\r\n    Malic acid                 12.11      11.11     11.57      6.04\r\n    Citric acid                 2.05       2.53      3.40      3.30\r\n    Oxalic acid                 1.53       2.97      2.03      3.38\r\n    Acetic acid                 0.42       0.29      0.43      0.22\r\n    Tannic acid                 1.13       0.98      1.48      0.51\r\n    Nitric acid                 1.32       0.60      1.88      0.23\r\n    Pectic acid                11.36      11.88      8.22     10.13\r\n    Cellulose                  15.76      10.59     12.48     11.82\r\n    Ammonia                     0.49       0.06      0.19      0.23\r\n    Soluble nitrogenous matter  7.74       8.84     13.90     10.39\r\n    Insoluble    ”        ”     9.75       7.97      8.10      9.53\r\n    Residue and chlorophyll     5.15       8.63      1.99      6.45\r\n    Oil                         1.03       1.26      2.28      0.81\r\n    Ash                        17.50      17.03     14.36     18.46\r\n    Undetermined                8.68      12.88     13.10     15.20\r\n\r\nAmong the undetermined matters are included those of a gummy or\r\nresinous composition not extracted by ether, the exact nature of\r\nwhich is not well understood, and the starches, sugars, pentosans and\r\ngalactan.\r\n\r\nTobacco grown in more northern latitudes has less nicotin than the\r\nsamples given in the foregoing table.\r\n\r\nThe following table shows the composition of tobacco grown in\r\nConnecticut:[618]\r\n\r\n    (A)= Unfermented,\r\n    (B)= Fermented,\r\n                  Upper leaves.

Estimation of Water.=—In the estimation of water in vegetable\r\nsubstances, as has already been noted, it is usual to dry them in\r\nthe air or partial vacuum, or in an inert gas, at a temperature of\r\n100° until a constant weight is reached. By this process, not only\r\nthe water, but all substances volatile at the temperature and in the\r\nconditions mentioned are expelled. The quantity of these volatile\r\nsubstances in vegetable matter, as a rule, is insignificant and hence\r\nthe total loss may be estimated as water. In the case of tobacco a\r\nfar different condition is presented, inasmuch as the nicotin, which\r\nsometimes amounts to five per cent of the weight of the sample, is also\r\nvolatile under the conditions mentioned. It is advisable, therefore, to\r\ndry the sample of tobacco at a temperature not above fifty degrees and\r\nin a vacuum as complete as possible. Tobacco is also extremely rich in\r\nits content of crystallized mineral salts, containing often water of\r\ncrystallization, and there is danger of this crystal water being lost\r\nwhen the sample is dried at 100°. The desiccation is conveniently made\r\nin the apparatus described on page 22. If a high vacuum be employed,\r\n_viz._, about twenty-five inches of mercury, it is better not to allow\r\nthe temperature to go above 40° or 45°. A rather rapid current of dry\r\nair should be allowed to pass through the apparatus for the more speedy\r\nremoval of the moisture and a dish containing sulfuric acid may also be\r\nplaced inside of the drying apparatus. It is possible by proceeding in\r\nthis way to secure constant weight in the sample after a few hours.\r\n\r\n=601. Estimation of Nitric Acid.=—The nitric acid in a sample of\r\ntobacco is most easily estimated by the ferrous chlorid process.[619]\r\n\r\nThe sample is best prepared by making an alcoholic extract which is\r\naccomplished by exhausting about twenty-five grams of the fine tobacco\r\npowder with 200 cubic centimeters for forty per cent alcohol made\r\nslightly alkaline by soda lye. The mixture is boiled in a flask with\r\na reflux condenser for about an hour. After cooling, the volume is\r\ncompleted to a definite quantity, and, after filtering, an aliquot\r\npart is used for the analytical process. It is evident that the nitric\r\nacid cannot be estimated in this case after previous reduction to\r\nammonia by zinc or iron on account of the presence of ammonia in the\r\nsample itself. If, however, the amount of ammonia be determined in a\r\nseparate portion of the sample, the nitric acid may be reduced in the\r\nusual way, by zinc or iron, the total quantity of ammonia determined by\r\ndistillation, the quantity originally present in the sample deducted\r\nand the residual ammonia calculated to nitric acid.\r\n\r\n=602. Sulfuric and Hydrochloric Acids.=—These two acids are determined\r\nin the ash of the sample by the usual methods. The sulfuric acid thus\r\nfound represents the original sulfuric acid in combination with the\r\nbases in the mineral parts of the plant, together with that produced\r\nby the oxidation of the organic sulfur during combustion. In order to\r\navoid all loss of sulfur during the combustion, the precautions already\r\ngiven should be observed. The separation of the sulfur pre-existing as\r\nsulfates from that converted into sulfates during the combustion is\r\naccomplished as previously directed.[620] For ordinary purposes, this\r\nseparation is not necessary.\r\n\r\nTo avoid loss of chlorin from volatilization during incineration the\r\ntemperature should be kept at the lowest possible point until the mass\r\nis charred, the soluble salts extracted from the charred mass and the\r\nincineration completed as usual.\r\n\r\n=603. Oxalic, Citric and Malic Acids.=—The separation and estimation of\r\norganic acids from vegetable tissues is a matter of great difficulty,\r\nespecially when they exist as is usually the case, in very minute\r\nproportions. During incineration, the salts of the inorganic acids\r\nare converted into carbonates and the subsequent examination of the\r\nash gives no indication of the character of the original acids. In\r\nthe case of tobacco, the organic acids of chief importance, from an\r\nanalytical point of view, are oxalic, citric and malic. These acids may\r\nbe extracted and separated by the following process:[621]\r\n\r\nTen grams of the dry tobacco powder are rubbed up in a mortar with\r\ntwelve cubic centimeters of dilute sulfuric acid (one to five) and then\r\nabsorbed with coarse pumice stone powder in sufficient quantity to\r\ncause all the liquid to disappear. The mass is placed in an extraction\r\napparatus of proper size and thoroughly extracted with ether until a\r\ndrop of the extract leaves no acid residue on evaporation. Usually\r\nabout ten hours are required. The organic acids are thus separated\r\nfrom the mineral acids. The ether is removed from the extract and\r\nthe residue dissolved in hot water, cooled, filtered, if necessary\r\nseveral times, until the solution is separated from the fat and resin\r\nwhich have been extracted by the ether. The filtrate is neutralized\r\nwith ammonia, slightly acidified with acetic and the oxalic acid\r\ncontained therein thrown out by means of a dilute solution of calcium\r\nacetate, which must not be added in excess. The calcium oxalate is\r\nseparated by filtration, and determined as lime oxid. To the filtrate\r\nis added drop by drop, with constant stirring, a dilute solution of\r\nlead acetate, prepared by mixing one part of a saturated solution of\r\nlead acetate with four parts of water. When the precipitate formed\r\nhas settled, the clear supernatant liquid is tested by adding a drop\r\nof acetic acid and a few drops of the dilute lead acetate. In case a\r\nprecipitate be formed, the addition of the lead acetate is continued\r\nuntil a precipitate is secured which will immediately dissolve in\r\nacetic acid. At this moment the citric acid is almost completely\r\nprecipitated. In order to avoid the accumulation of the acetic acid\r\nby reason of the repetition of the process as above described, the\r\nmixture is neutralized each time with dilute ammonia. The precipitated\r\nneutral lead citrate obtained by the above process, is separated by\r\nfiltration and, in order to avoid its decomposition when washed with\r\npure water, it is washed with a very dilute acetic acid solution of\r\nlead acetate. The washing and filtration are accomplished as quickly\r\nas possible, and the final washing is made with alcohol of thirty-six\r\nper cent strength. In the filtrate the residual lead citrate, together\r\nwith a little lead malate, are precipitated by the alcohol used as the\r\nwash and this precipitate is also separated by filtration. The filtrate\r\ncontaining the greater part of the malic acid is evaporated to remove\r\nthe alcohol and treated with lead acetate in excess. Afterwards it\r\nis mixed with five times its volume of thirty-six per cent alcohol\r\ncontaining a half per cent of acetic acid. In these conditions the lead\r\nmalate is completely precipitated as neutral salt, and after standing a\r\nfew hours, is separated by filtration. The three precipitates, obtained\r\nas above, are dried at 100° and weighed. If the precipitates have\r\nbeen collected on filter paper they should be removed as completely\r\nas possible, the papers incinerated in the usual way and any reduced\r\nlead converted into nitrate and oxid by treatment with nitric acid and\r\nsubsequent ignition. From the quantities of lead oxid obtained, the\r\nweights of the citric and malic acids are computed. The precipitate\r\nwhich is obtained by the action of alcohol, above noted, is also dried\r\nand ignited and the lead oxid found divided equally between the citric\r\nand malic acids, the respective quantities of which found, are included\r\nin computing their total weights. The weight of the citric acid is\r\ncalculated from the formula (C₆H₅O₇)₂Pb₃ + H₂O, and that of the malic\r\nacid from the formula C₄H₄O₅Pb + H₂O.\r\n\r\n=604. Acetic Acid.=—For the determination of the volatile acids of the\r\nfatty series existing in tobacco, the following process, also due to\r\nSchlösing, may be followed:[622]\r\n\r\nThe apparatus employed is shown in Fig. 121. Ten grams of the\r\npulverized tobacco, moistened with water and mixed with a little\r\npowdered tartaric acid, are placed in the tube _A_. The two ends of\r\nthe tube, _A_, are stoppered with asbestos or glass wool. Steam,\r\ngenerated in the flask, _D_, is passed into _B_. After fifteen minutes,\r\nor as soon as it is certain that the contents of _A_ have reached a\r\ntemperature of 100°, the dish, _F_, containing mercury, is placed in\r\nthe position shown in the figure. The steam, by this arrangement,\r\nis forced into the lower end of _A_, passes into the condenser _E_,\r\nand the condensed water collected in _C_. The operation should be so\r\nconducted as to avoid any condensation of water in _B_. It is advisable\r\nduring the progress of the distillation, which should continue for at\r\nleast twenty minutes, to neutralize from time to time the acetic acid\r\ncollected in _C_ by a set solution of dilute alkali, or, an excess of\r\nthe alkaline solution may be placed in _C_ and the part not neutralized\r\nby the acetic acid determined at the end of the distillation by\r\ntitration.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 121.—APPARATUS FOR ACETIC ACID.]\r\n\r\n=605. Pectic Acid.=—Under this term are included not only the pectic\r\nacid but all the other bodies of a pectose nature contained in tobacco.\r\nThese bodies are of considerable interest, although they do not belong\r\nto the most important constituents. In fresh tobacco leaves are found\r\nthree pectin bodies. One pectin is soluble in water, another is an\r\ninsoluble pectose and the third is the pectose body forming salts\r\nwith the alkalies, _i. e._, true pectic acid. In fermented tobacco\r\npectic acid is found chiefly in combination with lime in the ribs of\r\nthe leaves, serving to give them the necessary stiffness. For the\r\nestimation of the pectin bodies (mucilage) the powdered tobacco is\r\nthoroughly extracted with cold water. An aliquot part of the aqueous\r\nextract is mixed with two volumes of strong alcohol and allowed to\r\nstand in a well closed vessel in a cool place for twenty-four hours.\r\nThe precipitate is collected on a filter, washed with sixty-six per\r\ncent alcohol, dried and weighed. The dried residue is incinerated and\r\nthe amount of ash determined. In general, vegetable mucilages contain\r\nabout five per cent of ash. If more than this be found, it is due to\r\nthe solution of the salts of the organic acids contained in the sample.\r\nA dried vegetable mucilage, obtained as above, dissolves in water to\r\na mucilaginous liquid which does not reduce alkaline copper solution\r\nuntil it has been hydrolyzed by boiling with a dilute mineral acid.[623]\r\n\r\n=606. Tannic Acid.=—This acid is separated and estimated by the\r\nprocesses given in paragraphs =589-595=.\r\n\r\n=607. Starch and Sugar.=—The unfermented leaves of tobacco contain\r\nconsiderable quantities of carbohydrates in addition to woody fiber,\r\npentosans, galactan and cellulose. Among these, starch is the most\r\nimportant. Sugar exists in small quantities in the fresh leaf,\r\nusually not over one per cent. During fermentation, according to some\r\nauthorities, the starch is partially converted into sugar and the\r\nlatter substance disappears under the action of the alcoholic ferments.\r\nIt has been found at the Connecticut Station, however, that the starch\r\ncontent of the leaf does not decrease during fermentation. The starch\r\nand sugar may be determined in the fresh leaves by the methods already\r\ngiven.\r\n\r\nIn the manufacture of certain grades of tobacco it is customary to add\r\na quantity of sugar. The analyst may thus be called upon to determine\r\nin some cases whether the sugar found in a sample is natural or added.\r\nThe occurrence of natural sugars in tobacco has been investigated at\r\nthe instance of the British Treasury.[624]\r\n\r\nThe natural sugars which may be found in sun dried tobaccos usually\r\ndisappear entirely during the process of fermentation. It was found by\r\nthe Somerset House chemists that the content of sugar in commercial\r\ntobaccos varies from none at all to over fifteen per cent. A remarkable\r\nexample of this variation is reported in two samples from this\r\ncountry, one of which, grown in Kentucky, contained no sugar, and the\r\nother grown in Virginia, 15.2 per cent.\r\n\r\nIt was noticed that the saccharin matters in the tobaccos examined\r\nwere neutral to polarized light. They are determined by their copper\r\nreducing power. The tobacco sugars are therefore to be classed with the\r\nreducing bodies, not optically active, found in the juices of sorghum\r\nand sugar canes.\r\n\r\n=608. Ammonia.=—As has already been intimated, ammonia exists only\r\nin minute quantities in fresh tobacco leaves, but in considerable\r\nquantities after fermentation. In the estimation of ammonia, twenty\r\ngrams of the tobacco powder are digested with 250 cubic centimeters of\r\nwater, acidulated with sulfuric and after an hour enough water added\r\nto make the total quantity 400 cubic centimeters. After filtration, an\r\naliquot part of the filtrate, about 200 cubic centimeters, is treated\r\nwith magnesium oxid in excess and the ammonia and nicotin removed by\r\ndistillation in a current of steam. The distillate is collected in\r\ndilute sulfuric acid of known strength. The total amount of the two\r\nbases is determined by titration and the quantity of base representing\r\nthe nicotin, which has been determined in a separate sample, subtracted\r\nin order to obtain the weight of the ammonia.[625]\r\n\r\nThe ammonia in tobacco is determined by Nessler in the following\r\nmanner:[626]\r\n\r\nThe powdered tobacco is mixed with water and magnesium oxid and after\r\nstanding for several hours it is distilled in a current of steam, the\r\ndistillate received in dilute sulfuric acid and the process continued\r\nuntil a drop of the distillate gives no reaction for ammonia with the\r\nnessler reagent. The excess of sulfuric acid in the distillate is\r\nneutralized with pure sodium carbonate and the nicotin precipitated\r\nby a neutral solution of mercuric iodid and potassium iodid. The\r\nprecipitate is separated by filtration, the filtrate treated with\r\nsodium sulfid, and the ammonia again obtained by distillation with\r\nan alkali, collected in dilute solution of set sulfuric acid and\r\ndetermined by titration. The difference of the two determinations\r\nrepresents the ammonia.\r\n\r\n=609. Nicotin.=—In this laboratory McElroy has made a study of some of\r\nthe best approved methods for determining nicotin, and finds the most\r\nsimple and reliable to be that proposed by Kissling.[627] The finely\r\npowdered tobacco should be dried at a temperature not exceeding 60°, or\r\nit may be partially dried at that temperature before grinding and the\r\nfinal drying completed afterwards. Twenty grams of the powdered sample\r\nare intimately mixed by means of a pestle with ten cubic centimeters\r\nof dilute alcoholic solution of soda lye, made by dissolving six grams\r\nof sodium hydroxid in forty cubic centimeters of water and completing\r\nthe volume to 100 cubic centimeters with ninety-five per cent alcohol.\r\nThe mass is transferred to an extraction paper cylinder, placed in\r\nan extraction apparatus and extracted for three hours with ether.\r\nThe ether is nearly all removed by careful distillation, the residue\r\nmixed with fifty cubic centimeters of a very dilute soda lye solution\r\n(4 to 100) and subjected to distillation in a current of steam. The\r\nflask containing the nicotin extract should be connected with the\r\ncondensing apparatus by a safety bulb as is usual in the distillation\r\nof substances containing fixed alkali. The distillation should be\r\nconducted rapidly and in such a manner that when 200 cubic centimeters\r\nof the distillate have been collected, not more than fifteen cubic\r\ncentimeters of the liquid remain in the distillation flask. In\r\nthe distillate, the nicotin is determined by titration with a set\r\nsolution of dilute sulfuric acid, using rosolic acid or phenacetolin\r\nas indicator. It is advisable to titrate each fifty cubic centimeters\r\nof the distillate as it is received and the distillation is continued\r\nuntil the last fifty cubic centimeters give no appreciable quantity\r\nof the alkaloid. In the calculations one molecule of sulfuric acid is\r\nequivalent to two molecules of nicotin according to the equation\r\n\r\n    H₂SO₄ = (C₁₀H₁₄N₂)₂.\r\n     98       324\r\n\r\n_Polarization Method._—Popovici has based a method of detecting the\r\nquantity of nicotin in tobacco on its property of rotating the plane\r\nof polarized light.[628] The gyrodynat of pure nicotin is expressed by\r\nthe formula [_a_]_{D} = -161°.6. When ten parts of nicotin are mixed\r\nwith ninety parts of water, this value becomes -74°.1. By reason of\r\nthis great depression in gyrodynatic value Popovici determined the\r\nrelation which exists between the dilute solutions of nicotin and the\r\nnumber of minutes of angular rotation produced on polarization in a\r\n200 millimeter tube. In a solution in which two grams of nicotin are\r\ncontained in fifty cubic centimeters, each minute of angular rotation\r\nis found to correspond to 6.5 milligrams of nicotin. For one gram in\r\nsolution in the same volume one minute of angular rotation corresponds\r\nto 5.9 milligrams and for a half gram in solution to 5.7 milligrams.\r\n\r\nThe nicotin is prepared for polarization by extracting with ether, as\r\nindicated in the previous paragraph, and the ethereal solution from\r\ntwenty grams of tobacco is shaken with a concentrated solution of\r\nsodium phosphotungstate in nitric acid by means of which nicotin and\r\nammonia are precipitated and rapidly settle. The supernatant liquid\r\nis carefully poured off and the residue made up to a volume of fifty\r\ncubic centimeters with distilled water and the nicotin freed from any\r\nof its compounds by the addition of eight grams of finely powdered\r\nbarium hydroxid. In order to promote the decomposition of the nicotin\r\ncompounds the mixture should be shaken at intervals for several hours.\r\nThe at first blue precipitate changes into blue green and finally into\r\nyellow. It is separated by filtration and the somewhat yellow colored\r\nfiltrate placed in an observation tube, polarized, the polarization\r\ncalculated to minutes of angular rotation and the number of minutes\r\nthus found multiplied by the nearest factor given above.\r\n\r\nThe analyst will find a description of other methods of estimating\r\nnicotin in tobacco in the periodical literature of analytical\r\nchemistry.[629]\r\n\r\n=610. Estimation of Amid Nitrogen.=—For the estimation of amid\r\nnitrogen ten grams of the powdered tobacco are digested with 100\r\ncubic centimeters of forty per cent alcohol, the extract separated by\r\nfiltration, acidified with sulfuric and the albumin, peptone, nicotin\r\nand ammonia precipitated with as little phosphotungstic acid as\r\npossible. The precipitate is separated by filtration and seventy-five\r\ncubic centimeters of the filtrate evaporated in a thin glass or tin\r\nfoil capsule after the addition of a little barium chlorid and the\r\nnitrogen determined in the residue. The nitrogen thus obtained is that\r\nwhich was present in an amid state. The nitrogen present as amids,\r\nammonia and nicotin subtracted from the total nitrogen leaves that\r\npresent as protein.\r\n\r\n=611. Fractional Extraction of Tobacco.=—To determine the character of\r\nthe soluble constituents of tobacco it is advisable to subject it to\r\na fractional extraction with different reagents. The reagents usually\r\nemployed in the order mentioned are petroleum ether, ether, absolute\r\nalcohol, water, dilute soda lye and dilute hydrochloric acid. The\r\nextract obtained by petroleum ether contains vegetable wax, chlorophyll\r\nand its alteration products, fat, ethereal oils, and resin bodies.\r\nThe extract with ether may be divided into water soluble and alcohol\r\nsoluble bodies. Among the first are small quantities of glucosids and\r\nnicotin while in the alcoholic solution resin predominates.\r\n\r\nThe alcoholic extract is also divided into water soluble and alcohol\r\nsoluble parts. The first contains the nicotin, which is insoluble in\r\nether, in combination with acids, together with tannic acid and allied\r\nbodies and also the sugar. The part insoluble in water consists chiefly\r\nof resin.\r\n\r\nThe aqueous solution contains the vegetable mucilages (pectin) soluble\r\ncarbohydrates, soluble proteids and organic acids.\r\n\r\nThe dilute soda lye solution contains chiefly proteids.\r\n\r\nThe dilute hydrochloric acid solution contains the starch and the\r\noxalic acid originally combined with lime. The extractions with dilute\r\nsoda lye and dilute hydrochloric acid should be made at a boiling\r\ntemperature. The residual matter consists of a mixture of carbohydrate\r\nbodies to which the term crude fiber is usually applied.\r\n\r\n=612. Burning Qualities.=—When tobacco is to be used for the\r\nmanufacture of cigars, or cigarettes, or for smoking in pipes, its\r\nability to keep burning is a matter of great importance. The tobacco,\r\nwhen once ignited, should burn for some time and form, a fluffy ash,\r\nfree of fused mineral particles. A tobacco with good burning properties\r\nis one containing nitrates in considerable quantity, not too much sugar\r\nand starch, a porous cellular structure and comparatively free of\r\nchlorin. In determining comparative burning properties the tests may\r\nbe applied to the single leaf or the tobacco may be first rolled into\r\na cigar form and burned in an artificial smoker.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 122. APPARATUS FOR SMOKING.]\r\n\r\nIn applying the test to the leaf it is important that the ignition\r\nbe made with a fuse without flame, which maintains a uniform burning\r\npower. Any good slow burning fuse may be used and it is applied to the\r\nleaf in such a way that a hole may be burned in it, leaving its edges\r\nuniformly ignited. The number of seconds elapsing before the last spark\r\nis extinguished is noted. At the Connecticut Experiment Station a\r\nlighter, proposed by Nessler, is employed. It is prepared by digesting\r\neighty grams of gum arabic in 120 cubic centimeters, and forty grams of\r\ngum tragacanth in a quarter of a liter of water for two days, mixing\r\nthe mucilaginous masses and adding ten grams of potassium nitrate and\r\nabout 350 grams of pulverized charcoal. The mixture is rolled, on a\r\nplate sprinkled with charcoal, into sticks a few inches in length and\r\nof the diameter of a cigar and dried at a gentle heat. These fuses\r\nburn slowly and without smoke and are well suited for lighting tobacco\r\nleaves. Several tests, at least six, should be made with each leaf.\r\nLeaves having a uniform burning power should be used as comparators and\r\nthe number of seconds they burn be designated by 100. It is important\r\nthat all the samples to be tested be exposed for a day or two to the\r\nsame atmosphere in order that they may have, as nearly as possible,\r\nthe same content of moisture. The burning tests, when possible, should\r\nbe made both before and after fermentation. As a rule fermentation\r\nimproves the burning quality of second rate leaves, but has little\r\neffect on leaves of the first quality.\r\n\r\n=613. Artificial Smoker.=—For the purpose of comparing the burning\r\nproperties of cigars, or of leaves rolled into cigar form, the\r\nartificial smoking apparatus devised by Penfield and modified in this\r\nlaboratory is employed.[630] The construction of the apparatus is shown\r\nin the accompanying figure.\r\n\r\nThe lighted cigar is set in the tube at the left, so that air entering\r\nthe test-tube must pass through the cigar. The test-tube contains\r\nenough water to seal the end of the tube carrying the cigar, and is\r\nconnected with the aspirator on the right by the =T= tube, as shown. An\r\narm of the =T= dips just beneath the surface of the liquid in the cup\r\nin the center. Water flows in a slow stream into the aspirator through\r\nthe tube at the extreme right, forcing the air out through the arm\r\nof the =T= until the siphon begins to act. While the water is voided\r\nthrough the long arm of the siphon, air enters through the cigar, the\r\nliquid rising in the =T=. The action of the apparatus is automatic and\r\nintermittent. When the cigar is about one-third burned, it is removed\r\nwithout disturbing the ash cone, and the latter examined and compared\r\nwith other samples as a standard. The sealing liquid of the long arm of\r\nthe =T= may be mercury or water. In case mercury be used, care must be\r\ntaken not to immerse the open end of the =T= more than one millimeter\r\ntherein.\r\n\r\n\r\nFERMENTED BEVERAGES.\r\n\r\n=614. Description.=—Among fermented beverages are included those\r\ndrinks, containing alcohol, prepared by fermenting the sugars or\r\nstarches of fruits, cereals or other agricultural products. Wine\r\nand beer, in their various forms, and cider are the chief members\r\nof this class of bodies. Koumiss, although a fermented beverage, is\r\nnot included in this classification, having been noticed under dairy\r\nproducts. The large number of artificial drinks, made by mixing alcohol\r\nwith fruit and synthesized essences, is also excluded, although the\r\nmethods of analysis which are used may be applied also to them.\r\n\r\nFermented beverages containing less than two per cent of alcohol are\r\nusually regarded as non-intoxicating drinks. Beers are of several\r\nvarieties, and the term includes lager beer, ale, porter and stout.\r\nDistilled liquors are obtained by separating the alcohols and other\r\nvolatile matters from the products of fermentation by distillation.\r\nIt is not practicable here to attempt a description of the methods of\r\npreparing fermented drinks. Special works on this branch of the subject\r\nare easy of access.[631]\r\n\r\n=615. Important Constituents.=—Alcohol is the most important\r\nconstituent of fermented beverages. The solid matters, commonly called\r\nextract, which are obtained on evaporation are composed of dextrins,\r\nsugars, organic acids, nitrogenous bodies and mineral matters affording\r\nash on combustion. Of these the dextrins and sugars form the chief part\r\nand the proteid bodies nearly ten per cent in the case of beers made of\r\nmalt and hops. In beers the bitter principles derived from hops, while\r\nnot important by reason of quantity, are of the utmost consequence from\r\na gustatory and hygienic point of view. The ash of fermented beverages\r\nvaries with their nature, or with the character of the water used\r\nin making the mash. In the manufacture of beer, water containing a\r\nconsiderable proportion of gypsum is often used, and this substance is\r\nsometimes added in the course of manufacture, especially of wine. The\r\npresence of common salt in the ash in any notable quantity is evidence\r\nof the addition of this condiment, either to improve the taste of the\r\nbeverage or to increase the thirst of the drinker. In cider the organic\r\nacids, especially malic, are of importance.\r\n\r\nGlycerol is a product of fermentation and of the hydrolysis of the fats\r\nand oils in the substances fermented.\r\n\r\n=616. Specific Gravity.=—In order to secure uniformity of expression,\r\nthe specific gravity of fermented beverages is determined at about\r\n15°.6, although that is a temperature much below the average found in\r\nAmerican laboratories. The specific gravity may be determined by an\r\nalcoholometer, pyknometer or hydrostatic balance in harmony with the\r\ndirections given in paragraphs =48-54= and =285=. By reason of the\r\nextractive matters held in solution, fermented beverages are usually\r\nheavier than water, even if the content of alcohol be twenty per cent\r\nor more. On the other hand distilled liquors are lighter than water.\r\n\r\n=617. Determination of Alcohol.=—The determination of the percentage of\r\nalcohol present in a solution is based on two general principles. On\r\nthe one hand, and this is the base of the methods in common use, the\r\nalcohol is secured mixed only with water and its amount determined by\r\nascertaining the specific gravity of the mixture. On the other hand the\r\nquantity of alcohol in a mixture may be determined by ascertaining the\r\ntemperature of the vapors produced on boiling. This is the principle\r\ninvolved in the use of the ebullioscope. The latter method is not\r\nemployed to any extent in this country.\r\n\r\n_Use of the Alcoholometer._—The alcoholometer usually employed is\r\nknown by the name of Gay-Lussac, who first made practical use of it in\r\nthe determination of alcohol. It is constructed in such a way as to\r\nread directly the volume of absolute alcohol contained in one hundred\r\nvolumes of the liquid at a temperature of 15°.6. The instruments\r\nemployed should be carefully calibrated and thoroughly cleaned by\r\nwashing with absolute alcohol before use. The stem of the instrument\r\nmust be kept free from any greasy substance, and this is secured by\r\nwashing it with ether. After this last washing the analyst should be\r\ncareful not to touch the stem of the instrument with his fingers. It is\r\nmost convenient to make the determination exactly at 15°.6, but when\r\nmade at other temperatures the reading of the instrument is corrected\r\nby tables which may be found in works especially devoted to the\r\nanalysis of wines.[632]\r\n\r\nIn this country the alcoholometer is used to some extent, but the\r\nofficial method is based upon the determination of the specific gravity\r\nby an instrument constructed in every respect like the alcoholometer,\r\nbut giving the specific gravity of the liquor at 15°.6 instead of its\r\npercentage by volume in alcohol. The reading of the instrument having\r\nbeen determined at a temperature of 15°.6, the corresponding percentage\r\nof alcohol by volume or by weight is taken directly from the table\r\ngiven further on.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 123. METAL DISTILLING APPARATUS.]\r\n\r\n_Methods of Distillation._—The metal apparatus employed in the\r\nlaboratory of the Department of Agriculture, for the distillation of\r\nfermented beverages in order to determine the percentage of alcohol\r\nby the method given above, is shown in the accompanying figure. The\r\napparatus consists of a retort of copper carried on supports in such a\r\nway as to permit an alcohol or bunsen lamp to be placed under it. It\r\nis connected with a block tin condenser and the distillate is received\r\nin a tall graduated cylinder placed under the condenser in such a way\r\nas to prevent the loss of any alcohol in the form of vapor. Exactly\r\n300 cubic centimeters of the wine or fermented beverage are used for\r\nthe distillation. Any acid which the wine contains is first saturated\r\nwith calcium carbonate before placing in the retort. Exactly 100\r\ncubic centimeters of distillate are collected and the volume of the\r\ndistillate is completed to 300 cubic centimeters by the addition of\r\nrecently distilled water.[633] The cylinder containing the distillate is\r\nbrought to a temperature of 15°.6, the alcoholometer inserted and its\r\nreading taken with the usual precautions.\r\n\r\n_Official Method._—The alcoholometers employed in the official methods\r\nare calibrated to agree with those used by the officers of the Bureau\r\nof Internal Revenue. They are most conveniently constructed, carrying\r\nthe thermometer scale in the same stem with that showing the specific\r\ngravity. It is highly important that the analyst assure himself of\r\nthe exact calibration of the instrument before using it. Inasmuch as\r\nthe volume of the distillate may not be suited in all cases to the\r\nuse of a large alcoholometer, it is customary in this laboratory to\r\ndetermine the specific gravity by means of the hydrostatic balance,\r\nas described further on. Attention is also called to the fact that,\r\nin the official method, directions are not given to neutralize the\r\nfree acid of the fermented beverage before the distillation. Since the\r\nInternal Revenue Bureau is concerned chiefly with the determination of\r\nalcohol in distilled liquors, this omission is of little consequence.\r\nEven in ordinary fermented beverages the percentage of volatile acids,\r\n(acetic etc.,) is so small as to make the error due to the failure to\r\nneutralize it of but little consequence. In order, however, to avoid\r\nevery possibility of error, it is recommended that in all instances the\r\nfree acids of the sample be neutralized before distillation. In this\r\nlaboratory, the distillations are conducted in a glass apparatus shown\r\nin the accompanying figure. The manipulation is as follow:[634]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 124. DISTILLING APPARATUS.]\r\n\r\nOne hundred cubic centimeters of the liquor are placed in a flask of\r\nfrom 250 to 300 cubic centimeters capacity, fifty cubic centimeters\r\nof water added, the flask attached to a vertical condenser by means\r\nof a bent bulb tube, 100 cubic centimeters distilled and the specific\r\ngravity of the distillate determined. The distillate is also weighed,\r\nor its weight calculated from the specific gravity. The corresponding\r\npercentage of alcohol by weight is obtained from the appended table,\r\nand this figure multiplied by the weight of the distillate, and the\r\nresult divided by the weight of the sample, gives the per cent of\r\nalcohol by weight contained therein.\r\n\r\nThe percentage of alcohol by volume of the liquor is the same as that\r\nof the distillate, and is obtained directly from the appended table.\r\n\r\nIn distilled liquors about thirty grams are diluted to 150 cubic\r\ncentimeters, 100 cubic centimeters distilled and the per cent of\r\nalcohol by weight determined as above.\r\n\r\nThe percentage of alcohol by volume in the distillate is obtained from\r\nthe appended table. This figure divided by the number expressing the\r\nvolume in cubic centimeters of the liquor taken for the determination\r\n(calculated from the specific gravity), and the result multiplied by\r\n100 gives the per cent of alcohol by volume in the original liquor.\r\n\r\n=618. Determining the Specific Gravity of the Distillate.=—The specific\r\ngravity of the distillate may be determined by the pyknometer,\r\nalcoholometer, hydrostatic balance or in any accurate way. The volume\r\nof the distillate is not always large enough to be conveniently used\r\nwith an alcoholometer, especially the large ones employed by the Bureau\r\nof Internal Revenue. In the laboratory of the Agricultural Department,\r\nit is customary to determine the density of the distillate by the\r\nhydrostatic balance shown in paragraph =285=. The specific gravity\r\nis in each case determined at 15°.6, referred to water of the same\r\ntemperature, or if at a different temperature calculated thereto.\r\n\r\n=619. Table for Use with Hydrostatic Plummet.=—It is more convenient to\r\ndetermine the density of the alcoholic distillate at room temperature\r\nthan to reduce it to the standard for which the plummet is graduated.\r\nIn the case of a plummet which displaces exactly five grams, or\r\nmultiple thereof, of distilled water at 15°.6, the corrections for\r\ntemperatures between 12°.2 and 30° are found in the following table,\r\nprepared by Bigelow.[635]\r\n\r\nIf the weight of the alcoholic solution displaced be 4.96075 grams the\r\napparent specific gravity 0.99215 and the temperature of observation\r\n25°.4, the correction, which is additive, as given in the table is\r\n0.00191 and the true specific gravity is 0.99406 and the percentage of\r\nalcohol by volume 4.08.\r\n\r\nWhen the plummet does not exactly displace five grams of water at\r\n15°.6, but nearly so, the table may still be used.\r\n\r\nFor example, suppose the weight of water displaced be 4.9868 instead of\r\nfive grams. The apparent specific gravity of the water by this plummet\r\nis 0.99736 and the difference between this and the true specific\r\ngravity is 0.00264, which is a constant correction to be added to the\r\nspecific gravity as determined in each case.\r\n\r\n    CORRECTION TABLE FOR SPECIFIC GRAVITY.\r\n\r\n    _Below 15°.6 Subtract; Above 15°.6 Add._\r\n\r\n    Temp.

Calculating Results.=—The specific gravity of the alcoholic\r\ndistillate having been determined by any approved method and corrected\r\nto a temperature of 15°.6, the corresponding per cents of alcohol by\r\nvolume and by weight are found by consulting the following table.[636]\r\nIf, for example, the corrected specific gravity be exactly that given\r\nin any figure of the table the corresponding per cents are directly\r\nread. If the specific gravity found fall between two numbers in the\r\ntable the corresponding per cents are determined by interpolation.\r\n\r\n        TABLE SHOWING PERCENTAGE OF ALCOHOL\r\n            BY

Determination of Percentage of Alcohol by Means Of Vapor\r\nTemperature.=—The temperature of a mixture of alcohol and water vapors\r\nis less than that of water alone and the depression is inversely\r\nproportional to the quantity of alcohol present. This principle is\r\nutilized in the construction of the ebullioscope or ebulliometer.\r\nIn this apparatus the temperature of pure boiling water vapor is\r\ndetermined by a preliminary experiment. This point must be frequently\r\nrevised in order to correct it for variations in barometric pressure.\r\nThe water is withdrawn from the boiler of the apparatus, the same\r\nvolume of a wine or beer placed therein, and the vapor temperature\r\nagain determined. By comparing the boiling point of the wine, with a\r\nscale calibrated for different percentages of alcohol, the quantity\r\nof spirit present is determined. When water vapor is at 100° a _vin\r\nordinaire_ having eight per cent of alcohol gives a vapor at 93°.8. The\r\npresence of extractive matters in the sample, which tend to raise its\r\nboiling point, is neglected in the calculation of results.\r\n\r\n=622. Improved Ebullioscope.=—The principle mentioned in the above\r\nparagraph may be applied with a considerable degree of accuracy, by\r\nusing the improved ebullioscope described below.[637]\r\n\r\nThe apparatus consists of a glass flask F, shaped somewhat like an\r\nerlenmeyer, closed at the top with a rubber stopper carrying a central\r\naperture for the insertion of the delicate thermometer A B, and a\r\nlateral smaller aperture for connecting the interior of the flask with\r\nthe condenser D. The return of the condensed vapors from D is effected\r\nthrough the tube entering the flask F in such a manner as to deliver\r\nthe condensed liquid beneath the surface of the liquid in F as shown\r\nin the figure. The flask F contains pieces of scrap platinum or pumice\r\nstone to prevent bumping and secure an even ebullition. The flask F\r\nrests upon a disk of asbestos, perforated in such a way as to have the\r\nopening fully covered by the bottom of the flask. To protect F against\r\nthe influence of air currents it is enclosed in the glass cylinder E\r\nresting on the asbestos disk below and closed with a detachable soft\r\nrubber cover at the top. The temperature between the cylinder E and\r\nthe flask F is measured by the thermometer C and the flame of the\r\nlamp G should be so adjusted as to bring the temperature between the\r\nflask F and the cylinder E to about 90° at the time of reading the\r\nthermometer B. The bulb of the thermometer B may be protected by a thin\r\nglass tube carrying distilled water, so adjusted as to prevent the\r\nescape of the watery vapor into F. The thermometer B is such as is used\r\nfor determining molecular weights by the cryoscopic method. It has a\r\ncistern at A which holds any excess of mercury not needed in _adjusting\r\nthe thermometer_ for any required temperature.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 125. IMPROVED EBULLIOSCOPE.]\r\n\r\nA second apparatus, exactly similar to the one described, is\r\nconveniently used for measuring the changes in _barometric_ pressure\r\nduring the process of the analysis. The temperature of the vapor of\r\nboiling water having been first determined, the beer or wine is placed\r\nin F, and the temperature of the vapor of the boiling liquid determined\r\nafter the temperature of the air layer between E and F reaches about\r\n90°, measured on the thermometer C. By using alcoholic mixtures of\r\nknown strength the depression for each changing per cent of alcohol\r\nis determined for each system of apparatus employed, and this having\r\nonce been done, the percentage of alcohol in any unknown liquid is\r\nat once determined by inspecting the thermometer, the bulb of which\r\nis immersed in the vapor from the boiling liquid. In the apparatus\r\nfigured, a depression of 0°.8 is equivalent to one per cent of alcohol\r\nby volume. Full directions for the manipulation of the apparatus may be\r\nfound in the paper cited above.\r\n\r\n=623. Total Fixed Matters.=—The residue left on evaporating a fermented\r\nbeverage to dryness is commonly known as extractive matter, or\r\nsimply extract. It is composed chiefly of unfermented carbohydrates,\r\norganic acids, nitrogenous bodies, glycerol and mineral substances.\r\nHydrochloric and sulfuric acids may also be found therein. If any\r\nnon-volatile preservatives have been used in the sample, such as\r\nborax, salicylates and the like, these will also be found in the\r\nsolid residue. The bodies which escape are water, alcohols, ethers\r\nand essential oils. The character of the residue left by wines and\r\nbeers is evidently different. In each case it should contain typical\r\ncomponents which aid in judging of the purity of the sample. For\r\ninstance, in beers the substitution for malt of carbohydrate bodies\r\ncomparatively free of proteids, produces a beer containing a deficiency\r\nof nitrogenous bodies. Pure malt beer will rarely have less than\r\none-half of a per cent of proteids, while beer made largely of glucose,\r\nrice or hominy grits, will have a much smaller quantity. First will be\r\ndescribed below the methods of determining the fixed residue left on\r\nevaporation, and thereafter the processes for ascertaining its leading\r\ncomponents.\r\n\r\n=624. Methods of the Official Chemists.=—Two methods are in use by\r\nthe official chemists for determining the fixed solids in fermented\r\nbeverages.[638] They are as follows:\r\n\r\n_Direct Method._—Fifty cubic centimeters of the sample are weighed,\r\nplaced in a platinum dish about eighty millimeters in diameter and\r\ncapable of holding about seventy-five cubic centimeters and evaporated\r\non the steam bath to a sirupy consistence. The residue is heated for\r\ntwo and a half hours in a drying oven at the temperature of boiling\r\nwater and weighed.\r\n\r\n_In Sweet Wines._—Ten cubic centimeters of the liquor are weighed and\r\ndiluted to 100 with water. Fifty cubic centimeters of this solution are\r\nevaporated as described above.\r\n\r\n_Optional Method._—Fifty cubic centimeters of the sample are placed in\r\na platinum or porcelain dish and evaporated on the steam bath until\r\nthe volume is reduced to one-third. The dealcoholized liquid is washed\r\ninto a fifty cubic centimeter flask, cooled and made up to the original\r\nvolume. It is mixed thoroughly and the specific gravity ascertained\r\nwith a pyknometer, hydrostatic balance or an accurately standardized\r\nhydrometer. The percentage of total solids is obtained from the\r\nappended table. The column on the left of the specific gravity gives\r\nthe percentage of extract in a wine, as calculated by Hager, and that\r\non the right the percentage of extract in a beer or wort, as calculated\r\nby Schultze. According to Baumert, however, Schultze’s table gives\r\nresults which approximate more closely the data obtained by direct\r\nestimation than does Hager’s.\r\n\r\n    TABLES OF HAGER AND SCHULTZE

======+==================+===========\r\n\r\nIf it be desired to use this table for the examination of liquors\r\ncontaining a higher percentage of extract, Schultze’s table (intended\r\noriginally for wort) may be consulted.\r\n\r\nGautier regards the fixed solids as the residue obtained on\r\nevaporating, in a flat platinum dish, ten cubic centimeters of wine at\r\n100° for four hours and a half.[639]\r\n\r\nThe official French method is as follows: Twenty cubic centimeters of\r\nwine are placed in a flat bottom, platinum dish of such a diameter\r\nthat the depth of the liquid therein does not exceed one millimeter.\r\nThe dish should be immersed as totally as possible in the steam. The\r\nheating is continued for six hours.\r\n\r\nThe following method is used at the municipal laboratory of Paris:\r\n\r\nTwenty-five cubic centimeters of wine are placed in a flat bottom,\r\nplatinum dish seventy millimeters in diameter and twenty-five deep. The\r\ndish is placed on a water bath in such a manner that it just touches\r\nthe surface of the water which is kept at a constant level. The heating\r\nis continued for seven hours.[640]\r\n\r\n=625. Determination in a Vacuum.=—To avoid the changes and\r\ndecomposition produced by heating, the fixed solids may also be\r\ndetermined by drying the sample in a vacuum over sulfuric acid. In\r\nthis laboratory, it has been found that the process may be greatly\r\nfacilitated by connecting the desiccating apparatus with the vacuum\r\nservice of the working desks in which a vacuum corresponding to a\r\nmercurial column of 600 millimeters is obtained. The desiccator is\r\nprovided with a valve whereby a minute current of dry air is allowed\r\nto flow through it. This current is not large enough to lessen the\r\nvacuum but is sufficient to greatly accelerate the rapidity of the\r\nevaporation. The evaporation is hastened also, in a marked degree, by\r\nabsorbing the liquid with a piece of filter paper previously dried in a\r\nvacuum. When it is desired to examine the residue, however, it must be\r\nobtained in a flat dish exposing a large surface to evaporation.\r\n\r\n=626. Estimation of Water.=—It is evident that the percentage of water\r\nin a fermented beverage is easily calculated when the percentage of\r\nalcohol by weight and that of the dry residue are known. In a given\r\ncase, if the number of grams of alcohol in 100 of the sample be five\r\nand that of fixed solids four and a half, the quantity of water therein\r\nis 100 - (5.0 + 4.5) = 90.5 grams. In this case the volatile essences\r\nare counted as water, but these, at most, are so small in quantity as\r\nto be practically unweighable. Nevertheless, it must be admitted that\r\ndirect drying, in many cases, may give erroneous results, especially\r\nwhen the sample contains an abundance of ethers and of glycerol. The\r\nloss which takes place on evaporation may be diminished by adding to\r\nthe sample, before evaporation, a known weight of potassium sulfate\r\nin crystals, which serves to increase the surface of evaporation, to\r\nhasten the process and to obtain a quantity of residue in excess of\r\nthat secured by direct evaporation in an open dish.\r\n\r\n=627. Total Acidity.=—The acidity found in fermented beverages is\r\ndue both to the natural acids of the materials from which they are\r\nmade, and to those caused by fermentation. The typical acids also\r\nindicate the nature of the original materials, as malic in cider and\r\ntartaric in wine. The acids of beers are due almost exclusively to\r\nfermentation, and acetic is probably the dominant one. In determining\r\ntotal acidity, it is not always convenient to ascertain beforehand what\r\nacid predominates, nor to accurately distribute the acid among its\r\nvarious components. In the analytical work it is advisable, therefore,\r\nto estimate the total acid of cider as malic, of wines as tartaric and\r\nof beers as acetic. The process of titration is conducted as follows:\r\n\r\nExpel any carbon dioxid that is present by continued shaking. Transfer\r\nten cubic centimeters to a beaker and, in the case of white wines, add\r\nabout ten drops of a neutral litmus solution. Add decinormal sodium\r\nhydroxid solution until the red color changes to violet. Then add the\r\nreagent, a few drops at a time, until a drop of the liquid, placed on\r\ndelicate red litmus paper, shows an alkaline reaction.\r\n\r\nOne cubic centimeter of decinormal sodium hydroxid solution = 0.0075\r\ngram tartaric, 0.0067 of malic and 0.006 gram of acetic acid.\r\n\r\n=628. Determination of Volatile Acids.=—Fifty cubic centimeters of the\r\nsample, to which a little tannin has been added to prevent foaming,\r\nare distilled in a current of steam. The flask is heated until the\r\nliquid boils, when the lamp under it is turned down and the steam\r\npassed through until 200 cubic centimeters have been collected in the\r\nreceiver. The distillate is titrated with decinormal sodium hydroxid\r\nsolution and the result expressed as acetic acid.\r\n\r\nOne cubic centimeter of decinormal sodium hydroxid solution = 0.0060\r\ngram acetic acid.\r\n\r\nThe acidity due to volatile acids may be determined by ascertaining the\r\ntotal acidity as above described, evaporating 100 cubic centimeters to\r\none-third of their volume, restoring the original volume with water and\r\nagain titrating. The difference between the first and second titrations\r\nrepresents the volatile acidity.\r\n\r\nA method of determining volatile acidity in wines, without the\r\napplication of heat, has been proposed by de la Source.[641] The\r\nsample, five cubic centimeters, freed of carbon dioxid by shaking,\r\nis placed in a flat dish about eight centimeters in diameter. In a\r\nseparate portion of the sample, the total acidity is determined in the\r\npresence of phenolphthalien by a set solution of barium hydroxid, one\r\ncubic centimeter of which is equal to four milligrams of sulfuric acid.\r\nThe sample in the flat dish is placed in a desiccator, which contains\r\nboth sulfuric acid and solid potassium hydroxid, and left for two days,\r\nby which time it is practically dry. The residue is dissolved in two\r\ncubic centimeters of warm water and the dish is kept in the desiccator\r\nfor an additional two days. By this time the volatile acids, even\r\nacetic, will have disappeared and the residual acidity is determined\r\nafter solution in water.\r\n\r\nThe method is also applicable when wines have been treated with an\r\nalkali. In this case two samples of five cubic centimeters each are\r\nacidified with two cubic centimeters of a solution of tartaric acid\r\ncontaining twenty-five grams per liter. This treatment sets free the\r\nvolatile acids, and their quantity is determined as before.\r\n\r\n=629. Titration with Phenolphthalien.=—The total acidity is also easily\r\ndetermined by titration with a set alkali, using phenolphthalien as\r\nindicator. Colored liquors must be treated with animal black before the\r\nanalysis. The sample is shaken to expel carbon dioxid and five cubic\r\ncentimeters added to 100 of water containing phenolphthalien. The set\r\nalkali (tenth normal soda) is added until the red color is discharged.\r\nEven wines having a considerable degree of color may be titrated in\r\nthis way.[642] The acidity, expressed as tartaric, may be stated as due\r\nto sulfuric by dividing by 1.53.\r\n\r\n=630. Determination of Tartaric Acid.=—The determination of potassium\r\nbitartrate is necessary when an estimation of the free tartaric acid is\r\ndesired.[643]\r\n\r\nFifty cubic centimeters of wine are placed in a porcelain dish and\r\nevaporated to a sirupy consistence, a little quartz sand being added\r\nto render subsequent extraction easier. After cooling, seventy cubic\r\ncentimeters of ninety-six per cent alcohol are added with constant\r\nstirring. After standing for twelve hours, at as low a temperature as\r\npracticable, the solution is filtered and the precipitate washed with\r\nalcohol until the filtrate is no longer acid. The alcoholic filtrate\r\nis preserved for the estimation of the tartaric acid. The filter and\r\nprecipitate are returned to the porcelain dish and repeatedly treated\r\nwith hot water, each extraction being filtered into a flask or beaker\r\nuntil the washings are neutral. The combined aqueous filtrates and\r\nwashings are titrated with decinormal sodium hydroxid solution.\r\n\r\nOne cubic centimeter of decinormal sodium hydroxid solution = 0.0188\r\ngram potassium bitartrate.\r\n\r\nThe alcoholic filtrate is made up to a definite volume with water and\r\ndivided into two equal portions. One portion is exactly neutralized\r\nwith decinormal sodium hydroxid solution, the other portion added,\r\nthe alcohol evaporated, the residue washed into a porcelain dish and\r\ntreated as above.\r\n\r\nOne cubic centimeter decinormal sodium hydroxid solution = 0.0075 gram\r\ntartaric acid.\r\n\r\nAs, however, only half of the free tartaric acid is determined by this\r\nmethod:\r\n\r\nOne cubic centimeter decinormal sodium hydroxid = 0.0150 gram of\r\ntartaric acid.\r\n\r\n=631. Modified Berthelot-Fleury Method.=—Ten cubic centimeters of\r\nwine are neutralized with potassium hydroxid solution and mixed in a\r\ngraduated cylinder with forty cubic centimeters of the same sample.\r\nTo one-fifth of the volume, corresponding to ten cubic centimeters of\r\nwine, fifty cubic centimeters of a mixture of equal parts of alcohol\r\nand ether are added and allowed to stand twenty-four hours. The\r\nprecipitated potassium bitartrate is separated by filtration, dissolved\r\nin water and titrated. The excess of potassium bitartrate over the\r\namount of that constituent present in the wine corresponds to the free\r\ntartaric acid.[644]\r\n\r\n=632. Determination of Tartaric, Malic and Succinic Acids.=—Two hundred\r\ncubic centimeters of wine are evaporated to one-half, cooled and lead\r\nsubacetate solution added until the reaction is alkaline.[645] The\r\nprecipitate is separated by filtration and washed with cold water until\r\nthe filtrate shows only a slight reaction for lead. The precipitate\r\nis washed from the filter into a beaker, by means of hot water, and\r\ntreated hot with hydrogen sulfid until all the lead is converted into\r\nsulfid. It is then filtered hot and the lead sulfid washed with hot\r\nwater until the washings are no longer acid. The filtrate and washings\r\nare evaporated to fifty cubic centimeters and accurately neutralized\r\nwith potassium hydroxid. An excess of a saturated solution of calcium\r\nacetate is added and the liquid allowed to stand from four to six\r\nhours with frequent stirring. It is then filtered and the precipitate\r\nwashed until the filtrate amounts to exactly 100 cubic centimeters.\r\nThe precipitate of calcium tartrate is converted into calcium oxid by\r\nigniting in a platinum crucible. After cooling, from ten to fifteen\r\ncubic centimeters of normal hydrochloric acid are added, the solution\r\nwashed into a beaker and accurately titrated with normal potassium\r\nhydroxid solution. Every cubic centimeter of normal acid saturated\r\nby the calcium oxid is equivalent to 0.0750 gram tartaric acid. To\r\nthe amount so obtained, 0.0286 gram must be added, representing the\r\ntartaric acid held in solution in the filtrate as calcium tartrate. The\r\nsum represents the total tartaric acid in the wine.\r\n\r\nThe filtrate from the calcium tartrate is evaporated to about\r\ntwenty-five cubic centimeters, cooled and mixed with three times\r\nits volume of ninety-six per cent alcohol. After standing several\r\nhours, the precipitate is collected on a weighed filter, dried at\r\n100° and weighed. It represents the calcium salts of malic, succinic\r\nand sulfuric acids and of the tartaric acid which remained in\r\nsolution. This precipitate is dissolved in a minimum quantity of\r\nhydrochloric acid, filtered and the filter washed with hot water.\r\nPotassium carbonate solution is added to the hot filtrate, and the\r\nprecipitated calcium carbonate separated by filtration and washed.\r\nThe filtrate contains the potassium salts of the above named acids.\r\nIt is neutralized with acetic acid, evaporated to a small volume\r\nand precipitated hot with barium chlorid. The precipitate of barium\r\nsuccinate and sulfate is separated by filtration, washed with hot\r\nwater and treated on the filter with dilute hydrochloric acid. The\r\nbarium sulfate remaining is washed, dried, ignited and weighed. In\r\nthe filtrate, which contains the barium succinate, the barium is\r\nprecipitated hot with sulfuric acid, washed, dried, ignited and\r\nweighed. Two hundred and twenty-three parts of barium sulfate equal 118\r\nparts of succinic acid. The succinic and sulfuric acids, as well as the\r\ntartaric acid remaining in solution, which is equal to 0.0286 gram,\r\nare to be calculated as calcium salts and the result deducted from the\r\ntotal weight of the calcium precipitate. The remainder is the calcium\r\nmalate, of which 172 parts equal 134 parts malic acid.\r\n\r\nAccording to Macagno, succinic acid may be estimated in wines by the\r\nfollowing process:[646] One liter of the wine is digested with lead\r\nhydroxid, evaporated on the water bath and the residue extracted with\r\nstrong alcohol. The residual salts of lead are boiled with a ten\r\nper cent solution of ammonium nitrate, which dissolves the salts of\r\nsuccinic acid. The solution is filtered, the lead removed by hydrogen\r\nsulfid, boiled, neutralized with ammonia and treated with ferric\r\nchlorid as long as a precipitate is formed. The ferric succinate is\r\nseparated by filtration, washed and ignited. The succinic acid is\r\ncalculated from the weight of ferric oxid obtained.\r\n\r\nMalic acid in wines and ciders is determined by the method of Berthelot\r\nin the following manner:[647] The sample is evaporated until reduced\r\nto a tenth of its volume. To the residue an equal volume of ninety per\r\ncent alcohol is added and the mixture set aside for some time. The\r\ntartaric acid and tartrates separate, together with the greater part of\r\nthe salts of lime which may be present.\r\n\r\nThe supernatant liquid is decanted and a small quantity of lime\r\nadded to it until in slight excess of that required to neutralize\r\nthe acidity. Calcium malate is separated mixed with lime. The solid\r\nmatters are separated by filtration, dissolved in a ten per cent\r\nsolution of nitric acid, from which the lime bimalate will separate in\r\na crystalline form. The weight of calcium bimalate multiplied by 0.59\r\ngives that of the malic acid.\r\n\r\n=633. Polarizing Bodies in Fermented Beverages.=—The study of the\r\nnature of the carbohydrates, which constitute an important part of the\r\nsolid matters dissolved in fermented beverages, is of the greatest\r\nimportance. These bodies consist of grape sugars, sucrose, tartaric\r\nacid and the unfermented hydrolytic products derived from starch. A\r\nnatural grape sugar (chiefly dextrose) is found in wines. Sucrose\r\nis also a very important constituent of sweet wines. The hydrolytic\r\nproducts of starch are found in beers, either as a residue from the\r\nfermentation of malt or from the rice, glucose, hominy grits etc.,\r\nadded in brewing. The character and quantities of these residues can\r\nbe determined by the methods already given in the parts of this volume\r\nrelating to sugars and starches. For convenience, however, and for\r\nspecial application to the investigation of fermented beverages a\r\nrésumé of the methods adopted by the official chemists follows:[648]\r\n\r\n=634. Determination of Reducing Sugars.=—The reducing sugars are\r\nestimated as dextrose, and may be determined by any of the methods\r\ngiven for the estimation thereof (=113-140=).\r\n\r\n=635. Polarization.=—All results are to be stated as the polarization\r\nof the undiluted sample. The triple field shadow saccharimeter is\r\nrecommended, and the results are expressed in the terms of the sugar\r\nscale of this instrument. If any other instrument be used, or if it be\r\ndesirable to convert to angular rotation, the following factors may be\r\nemployed:\r\n\r\n    1° Schmidt and Haensch   = 0°.3468 angular rotation D.\r\n    1° angular rotation D    = 2°.8835 Schmidt and Haensch.\r\n    1° Schmidt and Haensch   = 2°.6048 Wild (sugar scale).\r\n    1° Wild (sugar scale)    = 0°.3840 Schmidt and Haensch.\r\n    1° Wild (sugar scale)    = 0°.1331 angular rotation D.\r\n    1° angular rotation D    = 0°.7511 Wild (sugar scale).\r\n    1° Laurent (sugar scale) = 0°.2167 angular rotation D.\r\n    1° angular rotation D    = 4°.6154 Laurent (sugar scale).\r\n\r\nIn the above table D represents the angular rotation produced with\r\nyellow monochromatic light.\r\n\r\n(_a_) _In White Wines or Beers._—Sixty cubic centimeters of wine are\r\ndecolorized with three cubic centimeters of lead subacetate solution\r\nand filtered. Thirty cubic centimeters of the filtrate are treated with\r\none and five-tenths cubic centimeters of a saturated solution of sodium\r\ncarbonate, filtered and polarized. This gives a solution of nearly\r\nten to eleven, which must be considered in the calculation, and the\r\npolariscope reading must accordingly be increased one-tenth.\r\n\r\n(_b_) _In Red Wines._—Sixty cubic centimeters of wine are decolorized\r\nwith six cubic centimeters of lead subacetate solution and filtered. To\r\nthirty cubic centimeters of the filtrate, three cubic centimeters of\r\na saturated solution of sodium carbonate are added, filtered and the\r\nfiltrate polarized. The dilution in this case is nearly five to six,\r\nand the polariscope reading must accordingly be increased one-fifth.\r\n\r\n(_c_) _In Sweet Wines._ (1) _Before Inversion._—One hundred cubic\r\ncentimeters are decolorized with two cubic centimeters of lead\r\nsubacetate solution and filtered after the addition of eight cubic\r\ncentimeters of water. One-half cubic centimeter of a saturated solution\r\nof sodium carbonate and four and five-tenths cubic centimeters of water\r\nare added to fifty-five cubic centimeters of the filtrate, the liquids\r\nmixed, filtered and polarized. The polariscope reading is multiplied by\r\n1.2.\r\n\r\n(2) _After Inversion._—Thirty-three cubic centimeters of the filtrate\r\nfrom the lead subacetate in (1) are placed in a flask with three cubic\r\ncentimeters of strong hydrochloric acid. After mixing well, the flask\r\nis placed in water and heated until a thermometer, placed in the flask\r\nwith the bulb as near the center of the liquid as possible, marks 68°,\r\nconsuming about fifteen minutes in the heating. It is then removed,\r\ncooled quickly to room temperature, filtered and polarized, the\r\ntemperature being noted. The polariscope reading is multiplied by 1.2.\r\nBecause of the action of lead subacetate on invert sugar (=87=) it is\r\nadvisable to decolorize the samples with other reagents (=87-89=).\r\n\r\n(3) _After Fermentation._—Fifty cubic centimeters of wine, which have\r\nbeen dealcoholized by evaporation and made up to the original volume\r\nwith water, are mixed, in a small flask, with well washed beer yeast\r\nand kept at 30° until fermentation has ceased, which requires from\r\ntwo to three days. The liquid is washed into a 100 cubic centimeter\r\nflask, a few drops of a solution of acid mercuric nitrate and then lead\r\nsubacetate solution, followed by sodium carbonate, added. The flask\r\nis filled to the mark with water, shaken, the solution filtered and\r\npolarized and the reading multiplied by two.\r\n\r\n=636. Application of Analytical Methods.=—(1) _There is no\r\nrotation._—This may be due to the absence of any rotatory body, to the\r\nsimultaneous presence of the dextrorotatory nonfermentable constituents\r\nof commercial dextrose and levorotatory sugar, or to the simultaneous\r\npresence of dextrorotatory cane sugar and levorotatory invert sugar.\r\n\r\n(_a_) _The Wine is Inverted._—A levorotation shows that the sample\r\ncontains cane sugar.\r\n\r\n(_b_) _The Wine is Fermented._—A dextrorotation shows that both\r\nlevorotatory sugar and the unfermentable constituents of commercial\r\ndextrose are present.\r\n\r\nIf no change take place in either (_a_) or (_b_) in the rotation,\r\nit proves the absence of unfermented cane sugar, the unfermentable\r\nconstituents of commercial dextrose and of levorotatory sugar.\r\n\r\n(2) _There is right rotation._—This may be caused by unfermented cane\r\nsugar, the unfermentable constituents of commercial dextrose or both.\r\n\r\n(_a_) The sugar is inverted:\r\n\r\n(_a_₁) _It rotates to the left after inversion._—Unfermented cane sugar\r\nis present.\r\n\r\n(_a_₂) _It rotates more than 2°.3 to the right._—The unfermentable\r\nconstituents of commercial dextrose are present.\r\n\r\n(_a_₃) _It rotates less than 2°.3 and more than 0°.9 to the right._—It\r\nis in this case treated as follows:\r\n\r\nTwo hundred and ten cubic centimeters of the sample are evaporated\r\nto a thin sirup with a few drops of a twenty per cent solution of\r\npotassium acetate. To the residue 200 cubic centimeters of ninety per\r\ncent alcohol are added with constant stirring. The alcoholic solution\r\nis filtered into a flask and the alcohol removed by distillation\r\nuntil about five cubic centimeters remain. The residue is mixed with\r\nwashed bone-black, filtered into a graduated cylinder and washed until\r\nthe filtrate amounts to thirty cubic centimeters. When the filtrate\r\nshows a dextrorotation of more than 1°.5, it indicates the presence of\r\nunfermentable constituents of commercial dextrose.\r\n\r\n(3) _There is left rotation._—The sample contains unfermented\r\nlevorotatory sugar, derived either from the must or mash or from\r\nthe inversion of added cane sugar. It may, however, also contain\r\nunfermented cane sugar and the unfermentable constituents of commercial\r\ndextrose.\r\n\r\n(_a_) The wine sugars are fermented according to directions in =262=.\r\n\r\n(_a_₁) _It polarizes 3° after fermentation._—It contains only\r\nlevorotatory sugar.\r\n\r\n(_a_₂) _It rotates to the right._— It contains both levorotatory sugar\r\nand the unfermentable constituents of commercial dextrose.\r\n\r\n(_b_₁) The sucrose is inverted according to (_c_), in (2).\r\n\r\n(_b_₂) It is more strongly levorotatory after inversion. In contains\r\nboth levorotatory sugar and unfermented cane sugar.\r\n\r\n=637. Estimation of Sucrose, Dextrose, Invert Sugar, Maltose and\r\nDextrin.=—The total and relative quantities of these carbohydrates are\r\ndetermined by the processes already described (=237-262=).\r\n\r\n=638. Determination of Glycerol.=—(_a_) _In Dry Wines and Beers._—One\r\nhundred cubic centimeters of wine are evaporated in a porcelain dish\r\nto about ten cubic centimeters, a little quartz sand and milk of lime\r\nadded and the evaporation carried almost to dryness. The residue is\r\nmixed with fifty cubic centimeters of ninety per cent alcohol, using\r\na glass pestle or spatula to break up any solid particles, heated to\r\nboiling on the water bath, allowed to settle and the liquid filtered\r\ninto a small flask. The residue is repeatedly extracted in a similar\r\nmanner, with small portions of boiling alcohol, until the filtrate in\r\nthe flask amounts to about 150 cubic centimeters. A little quartz sand\r\nis added, the flask connected with a condenser and the alcohol slowly\r\ndistilled until about ten cubic centimeters remain. The evaporation\r\nis continued on the water bath until the residue becomes sirupy. It\r\nis cooled and dissolved in ten cubic centimeters of absolute alcohol.\r\nThe solution may be facilitated by gentle heating on the steam bath.\r\nFifteen cubic centimeters of anhydrous ether are added, the flask\r\nstoppered and allowed to stand until the precipitate has collected on\r\nthe sides and bottom of the flask. The clear liquid is decanted into\r\na tared weighing bottle, the precipitate repeatedly washed with a few\r\ncubic centimeters of a mixture of one part of absolute alcohol and\r\none and five-tenths parts anhydrous ether and the washings added to\r\nthe solution. The ether-alcohol is evaporated on the steam bath, the\r\nresidue dried one hour in a water oven, weighed, the amount of ash\r\ndetermined and its weight deducted from that of the weighed residue to\r\nget the quantity of glycerol.\r\n\r\n(_b_) _In Sweet Wines._—One hundred cubic centimeters of wine are\r\nevaporated on the steam bath to a sirupy consistence, a little quartz\r\nsand being added to render subsequent extraction easier. The residue\r\nis repeatedly treated with absolute alcohol until the united extracts\r\namount to from 100 to 150 cubic centimeters. The solution is collected\r\nin a flask and for every part of alcohol one and five-tenths parts of\r\nether are added, the liquid well shaken and allowed to stand until it\r\nbecomes clear. The supernatant liquor is decanted into a beaker and the\r\nprecipitate washed with a few cubic centimeters of a mixture of one\r\npart alcohol and one and five-tenths parts ether. The united liquids\r\nare distilled, the evaporation being finished on the water bath, the\r\nresidue is dissolved in water, transferred to a porcelain dish and\r\ntreated as under (_a_).\r\n\r\n=639. Determination of Coloring Matters in Wines.=—The methods of\r\ndetecting the more commonly occurring coloring matters in wines as\r\npracticed by the official chemists are given below.\r\n\r\n(_a_) _Cazeneuve Reaction._—Add two-tenths gram of precipitated\r\nmercuric oxid to ten cubic centimeters of wine, shake for one minute\r\nand filter.\r\n\r\nPure wines give filtrates which are colorless or light yellow, while\r\nthe presence of a more or less red coloration indicates that an anilin\r\ncolor has been added to the wine.\r\n\r\n(_b_) _Method of Sostegni and Carpentieri._—Evaporate the alcohol from\r\n200 cubic centimeters of wine. Add from two to four cubic centimeters\r\nof a ten per cent solution of hyrochloric acid, immerse therein some\r\nthreads of fat-free wool and boil for five minutes. Remove the threads,\r\nwash them with cold water acidified with hydrochloric, then with hot\r\nwater acidified with hydrochloric, then with pure water and dissolve\r\nthe color in a boiling mixture of fifty cubic centimeters of water and\r\ntwo cubic centimeters of concentrated ammonia. Replace the threads by\r\nnew ones, acidify with hydrochloric and boil again for five minutes.\r\nIn the presence of anilin colors to the amount of two milligrams per\r\nliter, the threads are dyed as follows:\r\n\r\n    Safranin       light rose-red.\r\n    Vinolin        rose-red to violet.\r\n    Bordeaux-red   rose-red to violet.\r\n    Ponceau-red    rose-red.\r\n    Tropæolin oo   straw yellow.\r\n    Tropæolin ooo  light orange.\r\n\r\n(_c_) _Detection of Fuchsin and Orseille._—To twenty cubic centimeters\r\nof wine add ten cubic centimeters of lead acetate solution, heat\r\nslightly and mix by shaking. Filter into a test-tube, add two cubic\r\ncentimeters of amyl alcohol and shake. If the amyl alcohol be\r\ncolored red, separate it and divide it into two portions. To one add\r\nhydrochloric acid, to the other ammonia. When the color is due to\r\nfuchsin, the amyl alcohol will in both cases be decolorized; when due\r\nto orseille, the ammonia will change the color of the amyl alcohol to\r\npurple-violet.\r\n\r\n=640. Determination of Ash.=—The residue from the direct extract\r\ndetermination is incinerated at as low a heat as possible. Repeated\r\nmoistening, drying and heating to low redness is advisable to get rid\r\nof all organic substances. When a quantitive analysis of the ash is\r\ndesired, large quantities of the sample are evaporated to dryness and\r\nthe residue incinerated with the usual precautions.\r\n\r\n=641. Determination Of Potash.=—(_a_) _Kayser’s Method._—Dissolve\r\nseven-tenths gram pure sodium hydroxid and two grams of tartaric\r\nacid in 100 cubic centimeters of wine, add 150 cubic centimeters of\r\nninety-two to ninety-four per cent alcohol and allow the liquid to\r\nstand twenty-four hours. The precipitated potassium bitartrate is\r\ncollected on a small filter and washed with fifty per cent alcohol\r\nuntil the filtrate amounts to 260 cubic centimeters. The precipitate\r\nand filter are transferred to the beaker in which the precipitation was\r\nmade, the precipitate dissolved in hot water, the volume made up to 200\r\ncubic centimeters and fifty cubic centimeters thereof titrated with\r\ndecinormal sodium hydroxid solution, adding 0.004 gram to the final\r\nresult, representing the potash which remains in solution as bitartrate.\r\n\r\n(_b_) _Platinum Chlorid Method._—Evaporate 100 cubic centimeters of the\r\nwine to dryness, incinerate the residue and determine the potash as in\r\nash analysis.[649]\r\n\r\n=642. Determination of Sulfurous Acid.=—One hundred cubic centimeters\r\nof wine are distilled in a current of carbon dioxid, after the addition\r\nof phosphoric acid, until about fifty cubic centimeters have passed\r\nover. The distillate is collected in accurately set iodin solution.\r\nWhen the distillation is finished, the excess of iodin is determined\r\nwith set sodium thiosulfate solution and the sulfurous acid calculated\r\nfrom the iodin used.\r\n\r\n=643. Detection of Salicylic Acid.=—(_a_) _Spica’s Method._—Acidify 100\r\ncubic centimeters of the liquor with sulfuric and extract with sulfuric\r\nether. Evaporate the extract to dryness, warm the residue carefully\r\nwith one drop of concentrated nitric acid and add two or three drops\r\nof ammonia. The presence of salicylic acid in the liquor is indicated\r\nby the formation of a yellow color due to ammonium picrate and may be\r\nconfirmed by dyeing therein a thread of fat-free wool.\r\n\r\n(_b_) _Bigelow’s Method._—Place 100 cubic centimeters of the wine\r\nin a separatory funnel, add five cubic centimeters of sulfuric acid\r\n(1-3) and extract with a sufficient quantity of a mixture of eight or\r\nnine parts of ether to one part of petroleum ether. Throw away the\r\naqueous part of the extract, wash the ether once with water, then shake\r\nthoroughly with about fifty cubic centimeters of water, to which from\r\nsix to eight drops of a one-half per cent solution of ferric chlorid\r\nhave been added. Discard the aqueous solution, which contains the\r\ngreater part of the tannin in combination with iron, wash again with\r\nwater, transfer the ethereal solution to a porcelain dish and allow\r\nto evaporate spontaneously. Heat the dish on the steam bath, take up\r\nthe residue with one or two cubic centimeters of water, filter into\r\na test-tube and add one to two drops of one-half per cent solution\r\nof ferric chlorid. The presence of salicylic acid is indicated by\r\nthe appearance of a violet-red coloration. In the case of red wines,\r\na second extraction of the residue with ether mixture is sometimes\r\nnecessary. This method cannot be used in the examination of beers and\r\nales.\r\n\r\n(_c_) _Girard’s Method._—Extract a portion of the acidified liquor\r\nwith ether as in the preceding methods, evaporate the extract to\r\ndryness and exhaust the residue with petroleum ether. The residue from\r\nthe petroleum ether extract is dissolved in water and treated with a\r\nfew drops of a very dilute solution of ferric chlorid. The presence\r\nof salicylic acid is indicated by the appearance of a violet-red\r\ncoloration.\r\n\r\n=644. Detection of Gum and Dextrin.=—Four cubic centimeters of the\r\nsample are mixed with ten cubic centimeters of ninety-six per cent\r\nalcohol. When gum arabic or dextrin is present, a lumpy, thick and\r\nstringy precipitate is produced, whereas pure wine becomes at first\r\nopalescent and then gives a flocculent precipitate.\r\n\r\n=645. Determination of Nitrogen.=—The best method of determining\r\nnitrogen in fermented beverages is the common one of moist combustion\r\nwith sulfuric acid. The sample is placed in the kjeldahl digestion\r\nflask, which is attached to the vacuum service and placed in a\r\nsteam bath until its contents are dry or nearly so. The process is\r\nthen conducted in harmony with the well known methods. Where large\r\nquantities of the sample are to be employed, as in drinks containing\r\nbut little nitrogen, the preliminary evaporation may be accomplished in\r\nan open dish, the contents of which are transferred to the digestion\r\nflask before any solid matter is deposited. The same procedure may be\r\nfollowed when the sample foams too much on heating.\r\n\r\n=646. Substitutes for Hops.=—It is often claimed that cheap and\r\ndeleterious bitters are used in brewing in order to save hops. While\r\nit is doubtless true that foreign bitters are sometimes employed, the\r\nexperience of this laboratory goes to show that such an adulteration\r\nis not very prevalent in this country.[650] Possibly strychnin,\r\npicrotoxin, quassin, gentian and other bitter principles have sometimes\r\nbeen found in beer, but their use is no longer common. It is difficult\r\nto decide in every case whether or not foreign bitters have been added.\r\nA common process is to treat the sample with lead acetate, filter,\r\nremove the lead from the filtrate and detect any remaining bitters by\r\nthe taste. All the hop bitters are removed by the above process. Any\r\nremaining bitter taste is due to other substances. For the methods of\r\ndetecting the special bitter principles in hops and other substances,\r\nthe work of Dragendorff may be consulted.[651]\r\n\r\n=647. Bouquet of Fermented and Distilled Liquors.=—The bouquet of\r\nfermented and distilled liquors is due to the presence of volatile\r\nmatters which may have three different origins. In the first place the\r\nmaterials from which these beverages are made contain essential oils\r\nand other odoriferous principles.[652] In the grape, for instance, the\r\nessential oils are found particularly in the skins. These essential\r\nprinciples may be secured by distilling the skins of grapes in a\r\ncurrent of steam. This method of separation, however, cannot be\r\nregarded as strictly quantitive.\r\n\r\nIn the second place, the yeasts which produce the alcoholic\r\nfermentation are also capable of producing odoriferous products.\r\nThese minute vegetations, resembling in their biological relations\r\nthe mushrooms, grow in the soil and reach their maturity at about\r\nthe time of the harvest of the grapes. Their spores are transmitted\r\nthrough the air, reach the expressed grape juice and produce the vinous\r\nfermentation. The particular odor due to any given yeast persists\r\nthrough many generations of culture showing that the body which\r\nproduces the odor is the direct result of the vegetable activity of\r\nthe yeast. A beer yeast, after many generations of culture, will still\r\ngive a product which smells like beer, and in like manner a wine yeast\r\nwill produce one which has the odor of wine. The quantity of odorant\r\nmatter produced by this vegetable action is so minute as to escape\r\ndetection in a quantitive or qualitive way by chemical means. These\r\nsubtle perfumes arise moreover not only from the breaking up of the\r\nsugar molecule, but are also the direct results of molecular synthesis\r\naccomplished under the influence of the yeast itself.\r\n\r\nIn the third place, the fermented and distilled liquors contain\r\nodoriferous principles due to the chemical reactions which take place\r\nby the breaking up of the sugar and other molecules during the process\r\nof fermentation. The alcohols and acids produced have distinct odors by\r\nwhich they are often recognized. This is particularly true of ethylic,\r\npropylic, butylic, amylic and oenanthylic alcohols and acetic acid.\r\nThese alcohols themselves also undergo oxidation, passing first into\r\nthe state of aldehyds which, together with ethers, produce the peculiar\r\naroma which is found in various fruits. The etherification noted above\r\nis of course preceded by the formation of acids corresponding to the\r\nvarious aldehyds present. The formation of these ethers takes place\r\nvery slowly during aging, and it therefore requires three or four\r\nyears for the proper ripening of wines or distilled liquors. By means\r\nof artificial heat, electricity and aeration, the oxidizing processes\r\nabove noted may be hastened, but it is doubtful whether the products\r\narising from this artificial treatment are as perfect as those which\r\nare formed in the natural processes.\r\n\r\n\r\nAUTHORITIES CITED IN PART SEVENTH.\r\n\r\n[535] Bulletin 46, Chemical Division U.
