To-day it\r\nmay be questioned if any two localities of foreign and uncivilized\r\nlands are as well known, by name at least, as these that mark the\r\napproach to the arctic realm in the northwest of the American\r\ncontinent. One of those periodic movements in the history of peoples\r\nwhich mark epochs in the progress of the world, and have their source\r\nin a sudden or unlooked-for discovery, directed attention to this new\r\nquarter of the globe, and to it stream and will continue to stream\r\nthousands of the world's inhabitants. Probably not less than from\r\nthirty-five thousand to forty thousand people, possibly even\r\nconsiderably more, have in the short period following the discovery of\r\ngold in the Klondike region already passed to or beyond the portals of\r\nwhat has not inaptly been designated the New Eldorado. To some of\r\nthese a fortune has been born; to many more a hope has been shattered\r\nin disappointment; and to still more the arbiter of fate, whether for\r\ngood or for bad, has for a while withheld the issue.\r\n\r\nIn its simplest geographical setting Dawson, this Mecca of the north,\r\nis a settlement of the Northwest Territory of Canada, situated at a\r\npoint thirteen hundred miles as the crow flies northwest of Seattle.\r\nIt is close to, if not quite on, the Arctic Circle, and it lies the\r\nbetter part of three hundred miles nearer to the pole than does St.\r\nPetersburg in Russia. By its side one of the mighty rivers of the\r\nglobe hurries its course to the ocean, but not too swiftly to permit\r\nof sixteen hundred miles of its lower waters being navigated by craft\r\nof the size of nearly the largest of the Mississippi steamers, and\r\nfive hundred miles above by craft of about half this size. In its own\r\nparticular world, the longest day of the year drawls itself out to\r\ntwenty-two hours of sunlight, while the shortest contracts to the same\r\nlength of sun absence.\r\n\r\nDuring the warmer days of summer the heat feels almost tropical; the\r\nwinter cold is, on the other hand, of almost the extreme Siberian\r\nrigor. Yet a beautiful vegetation smiles not only over the valleys,\r\nbut on the hilltops, the birds gambol in the thickets, and the tiny\r\nmosquito, either here or near by, pipes out its daily sustenance to\r\nthe wrath of man. The hungry forest stretches out its gnarled and\r\nragged arms for still another hundred or even three hundred miles\r\nfarther to the north.\r\n\r\nUp to within a few years the white man was a stranger in the land, and\r\nthe Indian roamed the woods and pastures as still do the moose and\r\ncaribou. To-day this has largely changed. The banks of the once silent\r\nriver now give out the hum of the sawmill, the click of the hammer,\r\nand the blast of the time-whistle, commanding either to rest or to\r\nwork. A busy front of humanity has settled where formerly the grizzly\r\nbear lapped the stranded salmon from the shore, and where at a still\r\nearlier period--although perhaps not easily associated with the\r\nhistory of man--the mammoth, the musk ox, and the bison were masters\r\nof the land. The red man is still there in lingering numbers, but his\r\nspirit is no longer that which dominates, and his courage not that of\r\nthe untutored savage.\r\n\r\nThe modern history of Dawson begins with about the middle of 1896,\r\nshortly after the \"public\" discovery of gold in the Klondike tract.\r\nThree or four months previous there was hardly a habitation, whether\r\ntent or of logs, to deface the landscape, and the voice of animate\r\nNature was hushed only in the sound of many waters. At the close of\r\nthe past year, as nearly as estimate can make it, there were probably\r\nnot less than from fourteen thousand to fifteen thousand men, women,\r\nand children, settled on the strip of land that borders the Yukon,\r\nboth as lowland and highland, for about two miles of its course near\r\nthe confluence of the Klondike. Many of these have located for a\r\npermanence, others only to give way to successors more fortunate than\r\nthemselves. Some of the richest claims of the Bonanza, now a famed\r\ngold creek of the world, are located hardly twelve miles distant, and\r\nthe wealth of the Eldorado is discharged within a radius of less than\r\ntwenty miles. Over the mountains that closely limit the head springs\r\nof Bonanza and Eldorado, Hunker, Dominion, and Sulphur Creeks\r\nthread their own valleys of gold in deep hollows of beautiful\r\nwoodland--fascinating even to-day, but already badly scarred by the\r\nwork that man has so assiduously pressed in the region. This is the\r\nKlondike, a land full of promise and of equal disappointment, brought\r\nto public notice in the early part of 1897, when intelligence was\r\nreceived by the outside world regarding the first important gold\r\nlocation on Bonanza Creek in August of the year previous.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LOOKING DOWN THE LYNN CANAL--SKAGUAY RIVER, WITH\r\nSKAGUAY ON THE LEFT.]\r\n\r\nOn the 24th of July of the past year I found myself on the principal\r\nthoroughfare of Skaguay, the ubiquitous Broadway, contemplating a\r\njourney to the new north. The route of travel had been determined for\r\nme in part by the non-arrival at Seattle of the expected steamers from\r\nthe mouth of the Yukon River, and by that woeful lack of knowledge\r\nregarding \"conditions\" which so frequently distinguishes steamship\r\ncompanies. It was to be, therefore, the overland route, and from\r\nSkaguay it was merely the alternative between the White Pass and the\r\nChilkoot Pass or Dyea trails. The two start from points barely four\r\nmiles apart, cross their summits at very nearly the same distance from\r\none another, and virtually terminate at the same body of inland water,\r\nLake Lindeman, the navigable head of the great Yukon River. A more\r\nthan generous supply of summer heat gave little warning of that bleak\r\nand severe interior with which the world had been made so well\r\nfamiliar during the last twelvemonth, and from which we were barely\r\nsix hundred miles distant; nor did the character of the surroundings\r\nbetray much of an approach to the Arctic Circle. Mountains of aspiring\r\nelevations, six thousand to seven thousand feet, most symmetrically\r\nseparated off into pinnacles and knobs, and supporting here and there\r\nenough of snow to form goodly glaciers, look down upon the narrow\r\ntrough which to-day is the valley of the Skaguay River. At the foot of\r\nthis ancient fiord lies the boom town of Skaguay. Charming forests,\r\nexcept where the hand of man has leveled the work of Nature to suit\r\nthe requirements of a constructing railway, yet clothe the mountain\r\nslopes and fill in the gap that lies between them, shadowing the dense\r\nherbage and moss which almost everywhere form an exquisite carpeting\r\nto the underlying rock. The ear may catch the strains of a few\r\nmosquitoes, or the mellow notes of the robin or thrush, but rising far\r\nabove these in the majesty of tone and accent is the swish of the\r\ntumbling cataracts which bring the landscape of Norway to America.\r\nMan, it is claimed, is much the same the world over; but there is a\r\nlimitation. The second habitation of white man in Skaguay was\r\nestablished less than a year before my visit; yet at that time,\r\npresumably to meet the demands of a resident population of nearly five\r\nthousand, and of the wandering hordes pressing to the interior, the\r\ndestructive hand of the advertiser had already inscribed on the walls\r\nof rock, in characters twenty feet or more in height, and sufficiently\r\nelevated to make them nearly the most conspicuous elements of the\r\nlandscape, the glories of cigars, the value of mental and physical\r\nspecifics, and of other abominations which were contrived to fatten\r\nthe Yankee pocket.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A SUMMER DAY ON THE SKAGUAY.]\r\n\r\nHad it not been for the kindly advice of one who had just returned\r\nfrom the Klondike, and who claimed to have crossed both passes fifty\r\ntimes, I should almost unhesitatingly have taken the White Pass trail;\r\nbut the representation that beyond the summit the mud would be\r\nneck-deep and virtually impenetrable for a distance of twenty miles or\r\nmore, cast the decision in favor of the Chilkoot. The fortunate or\r\nunfortunate circumstance that a billowy sea made a landing of\r\npassengers at Dyea impossible on that day threw me back upon my first\r\nresource, and about two hours before midday of the 30th I was mounted\r\non a horse following out the Skaguay trail. By seven o'clock in the\r\nevening of the following day I had reached Lake Lindeman, and about a\r\nhalf hour later Lake Bennett, the starting point of the lines of Upper\r\nYukon steamers which had just recently been established. We had made\r\nthe forty miles of the dreaded White Pass trail without serious\r\nhindrance or delay, up over the summit of 2,860 feet elevation, and\r\ndown over a course which was depicted in colors of hardship that would\r\nhave done more truthful service in describing a pass in the Himalayas.\r\nThere was no mud, not a trace of snow or ice except on the mountain\r\ndeclivities, and had it not been for a horse that was both stiff and\r\nlame, and required my attention as pedestrian to an extent that had\r\nnot been bargained for, the journey would have been an exceptionally\r\ndelightful one.\r\n\r\nIt is true that an unfortunate fall at one time almost deprived me of\r\nmy animal, but the service of tackle soon put him to rights and to his\r\nfeet, and but few blood marks were left on the rocks to tell of the\r\nstruggle. The most disagreeable incident of the journey was a dense\r\nand shifting fog, which so blocked out the landscape of early evening\r\nas to necessitate \"feeling\" the brokenness of a glaciated country in\r\norder to ascertain wherein lay the trail. But beyond this there was a\r\nperpetual delight in the landscape--in the narrow rocky defile, the\r\nbursting torrent, the open meadows, with their carpet of green and\r\nvariegated with fireweed, gentian, rose, and forget-me-not, which more\r\nthan compensated for the little vexations that allied themselves with\r\nthe journey.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COMING DOWN THE WHITE PASS--WINTER.]\r\n\r\nIt is not often that the selection of a route of travel is determined\r\nby the odorous or malodorous qualities which appertain thereto. Such a\r\ncase was, however, presented here. It was not the depth of mud alone\r\nwhich was to deter one from essaying the White Pass route; sturdy\r\npioneers who had toiled long and hard in opening up one or more new\r\nregions, laid emphasis upon the stench of decaying horse-flesh as a\r\nfactor of first consideration in the choice of route. So far as stench\r\nand decaying horse-flesh were concerned, they were in strong evidence.\r\nThe Desert of Sahara, with its lines of skeletons, can boast of no\r\nsuch exhibition of carcasses. Long before Bennett was reached I had\r\ntaken count of more than a thousand unfortunates whose bodies now made\r\npart of the trail; frequently we were obliged to pass directly over\r\nthese ghastly figures of hide, and sometimes, indeed, broke into them.\r\nMen whose veracity need not be questioned assured me that what I saw\r\nwas in no way the full picture of the \"life\" of the trail; the\r\ncarcasses of that time were less than one third of the full number\r\nwhich in April and May gave grim character to the route to the new\r\nEldorado. Equally spread out, this number would mean one dead animal\r\nfor every sixty feet of distance! The poor beasts succumbed not so\r\nmuch to the hardships of the trail as to the inhuman treatment, or\r\nlack of care and assistance, which they received on the part of their\r\nowners. Once out of the line of the mad rush, perhaps unable to\r\nextricate themselves from the holding meshes of soft snow and of\r\nquagmires, they were allowed to remain where they were, a food\r\noffering to the army of carrion eaters which were hovering about,\r\nonly too certain of the meal which was being prepared for them.\r\nOftentimes pack saddles, and sometimes even the packs, were allowed to\r\nremain with the struggling or sunken animal--such was the mad race\r\nwhich the greed of gold inspired.\r\n\r\nOn October 9th I was again at Bennett, this time returning from my\r\njourney into the interior, and full of experience of what steam\r\nnavigation on the upper six hundred miles of Yukon waters might mean.\r\nThere was now a change in the sentiment regarding the quality of the\r\ntwo passes. The Pacific and Arctic Railway, the pioneer of Alaska\r\nsteam railways, was operating twelve miles of track, and had thus\r\nmaterially reduced the \"hardships\" of the Skaguay trail; the Chilkoot,\r\non the other hand, was represented to be in the worst of mood, and\r\nprepared to put the passing traveler into the same condition. It was\r\nmore than late in the season, but the winter's blasts had been stayed\r\noff by a full month, and there were still no signs of their coming. A\r\nlittle ice had begun to form along the river's margin and over\r\nsheltered pools, and an occasional cool night made demands for\r\nmoderately warm clothing proper; but, on the whole, the temperature\r\nwas mild and balmy, and to its influence responded a vegetation which\r\nin its full glory might easily have called to mind the region of the\r\nJuniata.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CUTTING GRADE FOR THE PACIFIC AND ARCTIC\r\nRAILWAY--TUNNEL MOUNTAIN, WHITE PASS ROUTE.]\r\n\r\nAlthough strongly warned against taking the Chilkoot Pass so late in\r\nthe season, many of the outgoers, whose recollections of events in the\r\nearly part of the year were still vividly fresh, and who could not be\r\npersuaded that the period of a few months had so effaced the\r\nconditions of the past as to permit a steam railway to enter for\r\ntwelve miles into the region, chose it in preference to the White\r\nPass. My own mind had been cast in the same direction; not, however,\r\nfrom a point of judicious preference, but merely because I was anxious\r\nto see for myself that which had become historic in the movement of\r\n1898, and of instituting a direct comparison of the physical features\r\nand general characteristics of the two routes. With no serious\r\nhindrance, the journey from Bennett out was that of a full day only,\r\nand there was no particular reason to suspect that there would be\r\ndelay. Snow had fallen on the summit and whitened all the higher\r\npoints, but seemingly it hung in only a measurably thin crust, and\r\nwith not enough to necessitate breaking a trail.\r\n\r\nA crude steam ferry across Lake Lindeman cuts off about six miles from\r\nthe first part of the trail, after which a rapidly rising path,\r\nsufficiently distinct to permit it to be easily followed, winds over\r\nthe rocks and among rock _débris_ to Long Lake, situated at an\r\nelevation of some twenty-six hundred feet, where night shelter is\r\nfound in a fairly comfortable tent. Up to this point we had\r\nencountered but little snow, and the condition of the trail was such\r\nas to allow of rapid travel. A wise caution detained us here for the\r\nnight, and the incoming of a solitary traveler warned us that a\r\nblizzard had struck the summit of the pass, and buried it beneath a\r\nheavy mantle of snow. Had we been a day earlier we might have crossed\r\ndry shod, a very exceptional condition at this time of the year, but\r\nnow the possibilities of a struggle gravely presented themselves. A\r\nlight frost of the night had fairly congealed the soil, but the lake\r\ndid not carry enough surface ice to interfere with the progress of a\r\nscow, and we reached the farther end without difficulty. The two-mile\r\nportage to Crater Lake was largely a snow traverse, but an easy one;\r\nat this time, however, it began to snow heavily, and the immediate\r\nprospect was anything but cheerful. A low fog hung over the waters,\r\nbut not so low or so dense as to prevent us from occasionally catching\r\nglimpses of the rocks which projected with disagreeable frequency from\r\nan assumed bottomless pit or \"crater.\" The ascent from Crater Lake to\r\nthe summit, somewhat less than three hundred and fifty feet, was made\r\nin about half an hour, and then began the steep and sudden plunge\r\nwhich marks the southern declivity of this famous mountain pass. Some\r\nlittle caution was here required to keep a foothold, and a too sudden\r\nbreak might have led to an exhilarating, even if not anxiously sought\r\nafter, glissade; but in truth, to any one only moderately practiced in\r\nmountaineering, even this steep face, which descends for a thousand\r\nfeet or more from a summit elevation of thirty-four hundred feet,\r\npresents little difficulty and hardly more danger. What there is of a\r\ntrail zigzags in wild and rapid courses over an almost illimitable\r\nmass of rock _débris_, at times within sheltered or confined hollows,\r\nbut more generally on the open face of the declivity. This it is more\r\nparticularly that carries to many a certain amount of fear in the\r\nmaking of the passage, but, with proper caution and the right kind of\r\nboots, nothing of danger need be apprehended.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately for the enjoyment of the scenery of the pass, I could\r\nsee but a modest part of it. Although snow was no longer falling, and\r\nthe atmosphere had settled down to a condition of almost passive\r\ninactivity--much to the surprise, if not disappointment, of a few who\r\nhad prophesied a stiff and biting wind the moment we passed the\r\ndivide--heavy cloud banks hovered about the summits, and only at\r\nintervals did they afford glimpses of the majestic mountain peaks by\r\nwhich we were surrounded. Enough, however, could be seen to justify\r\nfor the pass the claims of most imposing scenery, and its superiority\r\nin this respect over the White Pass. The temperature at the time of\r\nour crossing was a few degrees below freezing, perhaps 25° or 27° F.,\r\nbut our rapid walk brought on profuse perspiration, and it would have\r\nbeen a pleasure, if a sense of proper caution had permitted, to divest\r\nourselves of mackinaws and travel in summer fashion. We made Sheep\r\nCamp, with its surroundings of beautiful woodland, shortly after noon,\r\nand Cañon City, which, as the terminus of a good coach road to Dyea,\r\nvirtually marks the end or beginning of the Chilkoot trail, at two\r\no'clock.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE FINAL ASCENT TO CHILKOOT SUMMIT--WINTER.]\r\n\r\nTo a mountaineer or traveler of ordinary resource neither the White\r\nPass nor the Chilkoot Pass will appear other than it actually\r\nis--i. e., a mountain pass, sufficiently rough and precipitous in\r\nplaces, and presenting no serious obstacle to the passage of man,\r\nwoman, or child. True, I did not see them at their worst, but they\r\nwere both represented to be frightfully bad even at the time of my\r\ncrossing. The seasonal effects, doubtless, do much to modify the\r\ncharacter of the trails, and even local conditions must mold them to a\r\nvery considerable extent. It is not difficult to conceive of miry\r\nspots along the White Pass trail, or of snow-swept areas on the\r\nChilkoot, and there certainly must be times when both trails are in a\r\nmeasure or way impassable. All trails are, however, subject to\r\nmodifications in character, and even the best is at times sufficiently\r\nbad. Trains of pack animals cross the White Pass both winter and\r\nsummer, and, even with the great loss to their \"forefathers,\" their\r\ntestimony of steady work is a recommendation of the class of service\r\nin which they are engaged. A limited number of cattle and horses have\r\nalso found their way over the summit of the Chilkoot Pass--some\r\ncrossing immediately after us--but the trail is too steep on the ocean\r\nside to fit it for animal service, although I strongly suspect that\r\nwere the location in Mexico instead of in Alaska, there would be a\r\ngoodly number of _caballeros_ and _arrieros_ to smile at the\r\nproposition of presented difficulties. Indian women seem to consider\r\nit no hardship to pack a fifty-pound sack of flour and more over the\r\nsummit, and there are many men who do not hesitate to take double this\r\nload, and make several journeys during the same day. It is the load\r\nthat kills, and it was, doubtless, this influence, united to a cruel\r\nmethod, which so strongly impressed the pioneers with the notion of\r\nextreme hardship. The most level and perfect road, to one carrying for\r\nmiles a pack of from sixty to eighty pounds, soon begins to loom up a\r\nsteep incline.\r\n\r\nBoth the northern and southern slopes of the Chilkoot Pass are largely\r\nsurfaced with shattered rocks, over which, with occasional deflections\r\nacross more pleasant snow banks, a fairly well-defined trail mounts on\r\neither side to the summit. In its grim landscape effects, more\r\nparticularly on the inner face, where a number of rock-bound\r\ntarns--Crater Lake, Long Lake, Deep Lake--afford a certain relief to\r\nthe degree of desolation which the scene carries, it reminded me much\r\nof the famous Grimsel Pass, and here as well as there the modeling of\r\nthe surface through glacial action was strongly in evidence. The\r\nvastly towering Alpine peaks were, however, wanting, and the glaciers\r\nthat still appeared showed that they had long since passed their\r\nbetter days. The actual summit is trenched by a narrow rocky gap,\r\nroughly worn through walls of granite, and by it have passed the\r\nthousands who have pressed to the interior. There is no timber growth\r\nat or near this summit, nor is there soil sufficient to give support\r\nto an arboreal vegetation. Nearest to the top line a prostrate form of\r\nscrubby hemlock (_Tsuga Pattoniana_) alone makes pretense to being a\r\ntree, but below it of itself grows to majestic proportions, and about\r\n\"Sheep Camp,\" with Menzie's spruce, a birch, and cottonwood (_Populus\r\nbalsamifera_), forms part of the beautiful woodland, which with\r\never-increasing freshness descends to the lower levels.\r\n\r\nLest I be accused of too freely seeing the beauties of the northern\r\nlandscape, I venture in my defense the following graphic description\r\nof the Dyea Valley from the pen of another traveler and geologist,\r\nProf. Israel Russell: \"In the valley of the Taiya the timber line is\r\nsharply drawn along the bordering cliffs at an elevation of about\r\ntwenty-five hundred feet. Above that height the mountain sides are\r\nstern and rugged; below is a dense forest of gigantic hemlocks,\r\nfestooned with long streamers of moss, which grows even more\r\nluxuriantly than on the oaks of Florida. The ground beneath the trees\r\nand the fallen monarchs of the forest are densely covered with a soft,\r\nfeathery carpet of mosses, lichens, and ferns of all possible tints of\r\nbrown and green. The day I traversed this enchanted valley was bright\r\nand sunny in the upper regions, but the valley was filled with\r\ndrifting vapors. At one minute nothing would be visible but the somber\r\nforest through which the white mist was hurrying; and the next the\r\nveil would be swept aside, revealing with startling distinctness the\r\ntowering mountain spires, snowy pinnacles, and turquoise cliffs of ice\r\ntowering heavenward. These views through the cloud rifts seemed\r\nglimpses of another world. Below was a sea of surging branches that\r\nfilled all the valley bottom and dashed high on the bordering cliffs.\r\nMuch space could be occupied with descriptions of the magnificent\r\nscenery about Lynn Canal, and of the wonderful atmospheric effects to\r\nbe seen there, but the poetry of travel is foreign to these pages, and\r\nmust be left for more facile pens.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE CHILKOOT TRAIL--POWER HOUSE OF THE AËRIAL TRAMWAY.]\r\n\r\nIn its present condition the Chilkoot trail has the advantage over the\r\nSkaguay in its shorter length, the distance from Dyea to the head of\r\nLake Lindeman, the virtual head of river navigation, being about\r\ntwenty-four miles; from Skaguay to Bennett, along the usual White Pass\r\ntrail, the distance is fully ten or twelve miles longer, although a\r\ncut-off by way of the summit lakes reduces the traverse considerably.\r\nAt intervals along both routes fairly good accommodation can now be\r\nhad. One condition of the Chilkoot Pass, and that a not altogether\r\nlight one, places it during certain months at a disadvantage as\r\ncompared with the White Pass. I refer to the dangers from avalanches.\r\nThese are of the true Alpine type, having their source in the heavy\r\nbeds of snow which cling with bare support to the steeply pitching\r\nmountain walls, in places along some of the narrowest parts of the\r\npass. The appalling catastrophe of April, 1898, which caused the loss\r\nof sixty-three lives, and followed closely upon an earlier event of\r\nlike nature, had its seat in the steep, rocky ledges of the east wall\r\nbetween Sheep Camp and the Scales. It is claimed that the Indians\r\nalong the trail clearly foresaw the impending event, and announced it\r\nin unmistakable language, but their warnings were allowed to go\r\nunheeded. They themselves did not make the traverse on that day. The\r\nminor disaster of the following December (9th), when but six lives\r\nwere sacrificed, took place on the steep declivity which faces Crater\r\nLake, not far from the service house of the Chilkoot Pass Aërial\r\nTramway Company. Here the mountain face is very precipitous and gives\r\nbut insecure lodgment to the snow. The Indians carefully watch all\r\nnatural signals and urge a rapid journey. However useful these trails\r\nmay have been in the past, how well or how indifferently they may have\r\nmet the wants of the pioneers of 1897 and 1898, they are destined\r\nbefore long to be thrown into that same obscurity which they held when\r\nthe Indians and a few adventurous trappers and traders alone made use\r\nof them as avenues of communication between the inner and outer\r\nworlds. The advance of the iron horse is now an assured fact, and the\r\nPacific and Arctic Railway, whose construction is engineered by some\r\nof the most experienced mechanical talent of Great Britain and\r\nAmerica, will minister before many months not alone to the\r\nprofessional interlopers in the new land, but to hosts of tourists as\r\nwell. The road, which in reaching White Pass summit will have a\r\nmaximum gradient of a little more than five per cent, is of\r\nnarrow-gauge construction, solidly supported on dressed ties brought\r\nfrom the forests of Oregon. No terminal appears to have been as yet\r\ndefinitely determined upon, although the charter act recites Fort\r\nSelkirk on the Yukon, about one hundred and sixty miles above Dawson,\r\nas such. Operating as it now does sixteen miles or more of road, it is\r\nalready an extensive freight carrier; but until its completion to\r\nBennett or to some point close to a navigable part of the Yukon River,\r\nthe Chilkoot Pass tramway, a remarkable construction which crosses\r\nover the summit and deposits at Crater Lake, must continue to handle a\r\nlarge part of the business intended for the interior.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SUMMIT OF THE CHILKOOT PASS, WITH IMPEDIMENTA OF\r\nPROSPECTORS, APRIL, 1898.]\r\n\r\nIt is safe to say that the stirring scenes which were enacted on the\r\npasses during the winter of 1897-'98, when the impedimenta of travel\r\nand occupation were packed together in the manner of an army camp,\r\nwill not be repeated again. The past history was a short one, and it\r\ngives way to one of greater promise.\r\n\r\n\r\n     NOTE.--For most of the photographic illustrations the author is\r\n     indebted to the work of Curtis, Barley, and E.

D.,\r\n\r\nASSISTANT PROFESSOR OF SOCIOLOGY, MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF\r\nTECHNOLOGY, BOSTON, LECTURER IN ANTHROPOLOGY AT COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY,\r\nNEW YORK.\r\n\r\n\r\nPrehistoric archæology is possessed of a distinct advantage over\r\nlinguistics in the investigation of racial problems; for human remains\r\nare often discovered in connection with the implements, utensils, or\r\ntrinkets by which the civilization of an extinct people is\r\narchæologically determined. To attempt even an outline of the cultural\r\nhistory of Europe would be obviously impossible in this place. It\r\nwould fill a complete volume by itself alone. Furthermore, the short\r\nspan of forty years since the inception of archæological science has\r\nnot sufficed to produce complete unanimity of opinion among the\r\nleading authorities. Many important questions, especially concerning\r\neastern Europe, are still awaiting settlement. All that we can hope to\r\ndo is to describe what may be termed a few fixed points in European\r\ncultural history. This, as in our discussion of physical origins,[B]\r\nwe shall attempt to do by means of definite propositions, concerning\r\nwhich there is now substantial agreement.\r\n\r\nI. _In western and southern Europe an entirely indigenous culture\r\ngradually evolved during the later stone age. This was characterized\r\nby great technical advance in fashioning implements, carvings, and\r\ndesigns in stone, bone, ivory, and copper; by the construction of\r\ndolmens and habitations of stone; by pottery-making; and possibly even\r\nby a primitive system of writing._\r\n\r\nA marked reaction has taken place during the last ten years among\r\narchæologists respecting the course of cultural development in France.\r\nIt was long believed that after the first crude attempts of the\r\npalæolithic epoch an extended _hiatus_ ensued, followed by the sudden\r\nappearance of a more highly developed civilization, brought by an\r\nimmigrant broad-headed race from the East. Two waves of invasion were\r\ndescribed: the first bringing polished stone, a later one introducing\r\nbronze, cereals, agriculture, and the domestication of animals. Not\r\neven credit for the construction of the great stone dolmen tombs was\r\ngranted to the natives in Gaul, for these were all ascribed to an\r\ninvasion from the North. The undoubted submergence of the primitive\r\nlong-headed population of France by a brachycephalic type from the\r\nEast, to which we have already adverted, was held accountable for a\r\nradical advance in civilization. Even the existence of a bronze age\r\nwas denied to this country, it being maintained that the introduction\r\nof bronze was retarded until both metals came in together from the\r\nOrient in the hands of the cultural deliverers of the land. The\r\nabsence of a distinct bronze age was speedily disproved; but the view\r\nthat France and western Europe were saved from barbarism only by a new\r\nrace from the East still held sway. It is represented by the classical\r\nschool of G. de Mortillet, Bertrand, Topinard, and a host of minor\r\ndisciples. The new school, holding that a steady and uninterrupted\r\ndevelopment of culture _in situ_ was taking place, is represented\r\nnotably by Reinach[C] in France and by Sergi[D] in Italy. Their proof\r\nof this seems to be unanswerable. Granting that it is easier to borrow\r\nculture than to evolve it, a proposition underlying the older view, it\r\nseems nevertheless that the West has too long been denied its rightful\r\nshare in the history of European civilization.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: NEOLITHIC IVORY CARVING. Mas d'Azil.\r\n\r\n(By special permission. Further reproduction prohibited.)]\r\n\r\nA notable advance in the line of culture entirely indigenous to\r\nsouthwestern Europe has been lately revealed through the interesting\r\ndiscoveries by Piette at the station of Brassempuoy and in the grotto\r\nof Mas d'Azil. Carvings in ivory, designs upon bone, evidence of a\r\nnumerical system, of settled habitations, and, most important of all,\r\nof a domestication of the reindeer, of the horse, and the ox in the\r\npure stone age have been found; and that, too, in the uttermost\r\nsouthwestern corner of Europe. In the lake dwellings of Switzerland,\r\nas also in Scandinavia, a knowledge of agriculture, pottery, and the\r\ndomestication of animals is evinced, likewise as a native discovery.\r\nFrom other quarters of the continent in the stone age comes similar\r\ntestimony to a marked advance of man culturally. The justly celebrated\r\ncarving of a reindeer from Thayngen, almost worthy of a modern\r\ncraftsman, betrays no mean artistic ability. The man who drew it was\r\nfar from being a savage, even if he knew no metals, and buried his\r\ndead instead of cremating them. The evidence as to early domestication\r\nof animals is perhaps the most startling. Carved horses' heads, with\r\nhalters and rude bridles, have been surely identified by Piette and\r\nothers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BONE CARVING. Thayngen. (After Bertrand, 1891.)]\r\n\r\nA system of writing seems also to have been invented in western Europe\r\nas far back as the stone age.[E] Letourneau and Bordier have advanced\r\ngood evidence to this effect, although it is not yet incontestably\r\nproved. The Phoenicians were perhaps antedated in their noted\r\ninvention by the dolmen builders, by the lake dwellers of the earliest\r\ntimes, and, according to Sergi, also by the people of the Villanova\r\npre-Etruscan culture in Italy. In an earlier time still in the Po\r\nValley, as far back as the stone-age _Terramare_ period, pottery was\r\nmade, and that, too, of a very decent sort. And all this time there is\r\nnot the slightest evidence of contact with or knowledge of the East.\r\nAs Reinach says, in no dolmen, no lake station, no excavation of the\r\nstone age is there any trace of an Assyrian or Babylonian cylinder, or\r\neven an Egyptian amulet. Even the jade and nephrite found in western\r\nEurope from Switzerland to Norway, which has so long been regarded as\r\nevidence of early commerce with the East, he denies as proof of such\r\ncontact. The case thus put may perhaps be over-strenuously stated, yet\r\none can not but realize from it that western Europe has too long been\r\nlibeled in respect of its native aptitude for civilization. This is\r\nnot constituted of bronze alone, nor is its trade-mark cremation.\r\nThus, while an intensive outbreak of culture of a high order may not\r\nhave arisen west of the Alps, it can no longer be denied that the\r\ngeneral standard of intelligence was surely rising of its own native\r\nvolition.\r\n\r\nII. _Throughout the eastern Alpine highlands, a culture far more\r\nhighly evolved than the neolithic one in the West, and betraying\r\ncertain Oriental affinities, appears at a very early time, a thousand\r\nyears or more before the Christian era. This prehistoric civilization\r\nrepresents a transitional stage between bronze and iron._\r\n\r\nIn a secluded valley in upper Austria, close to the border line of\r\nSalzburg, by the little Alpine hamlet of Hallstatt, a remarkable\r\nnecropolis was discovered more than a half century ago, which marked\r\nan epoch in archæological research. Excavations at this place alone,\r\nfar from any present considerable seat of population, have already\r\nrevealed more than three thousand graves. The primitive culture here\r\nunearthed, represented by all kinds of weapons, implements, and\r\nornaments, bore no resemblance to any of the then known classical ones\r\nof the Mediterranean basin. Its graves contained no Roman coins or\r\nrelics. There was nothing Greek about it. It contained no trace either\r\nof writing or chronology. It was obviously prehistoric; there was no\r\nsuggestion of a likeness to the early civilizations in Scandinavia. It\r\nwas even more primitive than the Etruscan, and entirely different from\r\nit, especially in its lack of the beautiful pottery known to these\r\npredecessors of the Romans. Little wonder that von Sacken, who first\r\nadequately described it in 1868, and Hochstetter, who worthily carried\r\non his researches, believed that Hallstatt represented an entirely\r\nindigenous and extinct Alpine civilization. On the other hand, so\r\nexceedingly rich and varied were the finds in this out-of-the-way\r\ncorner of Europe, that another and quite different view seemed\r\njustifiable. Might this not be an entirely exotic culture? products\r\ngained by trade from all parts of the world, being here deposited with\r\ntheir dead by a people who controlled the great and very ancient salt\r\nmines hereabouts? Neither of these interpretations of this find at\r\nHallstatt have been exactly verified by later researches, and yet its\r\nimportance has not lessened in the least. By later discoveries all\r\nover eastern Europe south of the Danube, from the Tyrol over to the\r\nBalkan peninsula, as well as throughout northern Italy, Würtemberg,\r\nand even over into northeastern France, the wide extension of this\r\ncivilization[F] proves that it must in a large measure have developed\r\nupon the spot, and not come as an importation from abroad. On the\r\nother hand, its affinity in many details with the cultures both of\r\nItaly and Greece proved that it had made heavy drafts upon each of\r\nthese, profiting greatly thereby. The best opinion to-day is, that it\r\nconstitutes a link in the chain of culture between eastern and western\r\nEurope. As such it is of primary importance in any study of European\r\norigins.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BRONZE SITULA.\r\n\r\nWatsch, Austrian Tyrol.]\r\n\r\nThe primitive stage of European civilization, to which the term\r\nHallstatt is specifically applied by archæologists, is characterized\r\nby a knowledge both of bronze and iron, although the latter is\r\nrelatively insignificant. Its rarity indicates that we have to do with\r\nthe very beginnings of its use. In this early combination of bronze\r\nand iron the Hallstatt culture is in strong contrast with the rest of\r\nEurope. Almost everywhere else, as in Hungary for example, a pure\r\nbronze age--sometimes one even of copper also--intervenes between the\r\nuse of stone and iron. Here, however, the two metals, bronze and iron,\r\nappear simultaneously. There is no evidence of a use of bronze alone.\r\nBearing in mind, what we shall subsequently emphasize in the case of\r\nScandinavia, that in that remote part of Europe man had to put up with\r\nthe inferior metal for close upon a thousand years before the\r\nacquisition of a better substitute, it will be seen that at Hallstatt\r\na remarkable foreshortening of cultural evolution had ensued. Iron, as\r\nwe have said, was still comparatively rare. Only in the case of small\r\nobjects, less often in the blades of bronze-handled swords, does this\r\nmore precious metal appear. But it is far more common than in the\r\nearliest Greek civilizations made known to us by Schliemann and\r\nothers.\r\n\r\nPages of description would not give so clear an idea of this early\r\ncivilization as the pictures of their lives, which the Hallstatt\r\npeople have fortunately left to us. These are found in _repoussé_ upon\r\ntheir bronzes, and particularly upon their little _situlæ_, or\r\nmetallic pails. These _situlæ_ are, in fact, the most distinctive\r\nfeature among all the objects which they have left to us. By means of\r\nthem their civilization has been most accurately traced and identified\r\ngeographically. On the opposite page we have reproduced the design\r\nupon the most celebrated of these _situlæ_, discovered by Deschmann in\r\n1882, at Watsch in the Tyrol. Another from Bologna, typical of the\r\npre-Etruscan Italian time, will be found upon a later page. Upon each\r\nof these, the skill manifested in the representation of men and\r\nanimals is no less remarkable than the civilization which it depicts.\r\nThe upper zone of this _situla_ from Watsch apparently shows a festal\r\nprocession, possibly a wedding, for a lady rides in the second\r\nchariot. The grooms and outriders betoken a party of distinction. As\r\nfor the second zone, doubt as to its exact interpretation prevails.\r\nHochstetter declares it to be a banquet, food and entertainment being\r\noffered to the personages seated upon chairs at the left. Bertrand is\r\ndisposed to give it more of a religious interpretation. As for the\r\ncontest between gladiators armed with the cestus, all is plain. The\r\nspectators, judges, even the ram and the helmet for reward of the\r\nvictor, are all shown in detail. It is not necessary for us to cite\r\nmore evidence. A civilization already far from primitive is surely\r\ndepicted. As for its date, all are agreed that it is at least as early\r\nas ten centuries before Christ;[G] not far, that is to say, from the\r\nsupposed Homeric epoch in Greece.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BRONZE BREASTPLATE FROM OLYMPIA. (After Furtwaengler's\r\nOlympia, 1892.)]\r\n\r\nThe Hallstatt civilizations betray unmistakable affinities with three\r\nother prehistoric European cultures, widely separated from one\r\nanother. It contains many early Greek elements; it is very similar to\r\na notable prehistoric culture in the Caucasus Mountains; and it\r\nresembles most nearly of all perhaps the pre-Etruscan civilization in\r\nItaly. With the third of these--the Italian--it seems to have been\r\nmost nearly upon terms of equality, each borrowing from the other,\r\nafter a fashion of which we shall have occasion to speak shortly. On\r\nthe other hand, the relation of the Hallstatt culture to that of\r\nGreece and Caucasia seems to be somewhat more filial rather than\r\nfraternal. In describing the area of this civilization, we have seen\r\nhow firmly it is intrenched all through the southern part of\r\nAustria-Hungary and well over into the north of the Balkan peninsula.\r\nA comparison of Furtwaengler's magnificent collection of objects from\r\nOlympia with those of Hallstatt instantly reveals their similarities.\r\nTo make this clear, we have reproduced one of the Olympian\r\nbreastplates, ornamented with figures, which at once suggest those\r\nupon the _situla_ from Watsch above described. This design is doubly\r\ninteresting. It shows us a slightly higher stage of the art of figural\r\nrepresentation, as well as of conventional design. Not only the men\r\nand horses, but the borders, are far better drawn. More than this, we\r\nbegin to detect a distinctly Oriental motive in other details. The\r\nbulls and the lions--lions are not indigenous to Europe nowadays--at\r\nonce remind us of their Babylonian and Assyrian prototypes. We have\r\nentered the sphere of Asiatic artistic influence, albeit very\r\nindistinctly. This design here represented, it should be said, is\r\nrather above the average of the Olympian finds of the earlier epoch.\r\nMany of the other objects, especially the little votive figures of\r\nbeasts and men, are much more crude, although always characteristic\r\nand rudely artistic in many ways. Through this Olympian stage of\r\nculture we pass transitionally on to the Mycenæan, which brings us\r\ninto the full bloom of the classic Greek.\r\n\r\nThe Oriental affinities of the Hallstatt culture have been especially\r\nemphasized by recent archæological discoveries at Koban, in the\r\nCaucasus Mountains. A stage of culture transitional between bronze and\r\niron, almost exactly equivalent to that of the eastern Alps, is\r\nrevealed. Similarities in little objects, like fibulæ, might easily be\r\naccounted for as having passed in trade, but the relationship is too\r\nintimate to be thus explained. Hungary forms the connecting link\r\nbetween the two. In many respects its bronze age is different from\r\nthat of Hallstatt, notably in that the latter seems to have acquired\r\nthe knowledge of iron and of bronze at about the same time. In Hungary\r\nthe pure bronze age lasted a long time, and attained a full maturity.\r\nA characteristic piece is represented herewith. In respect of the\r\nrepresentation of figures of animals such as these, Hallstatt,\r\nHungary, and Koban are quite alike.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HUNGARIAN BRONZE VESSEL. (After Hampel, 1876.)]\r\n\r\nHave we proved that bronze culture came from Asia by reason of these\r\nrecent finds in the Caucasus? Great stress has been laid upon them in\r\nthe discussion of European origins. Are we justified in agreeing with\r\nChantre that two currents of culture have swept from Asia into\r\nEurope--one by the Caucasus north of the Black Sea and up the Danube;\r\nthe other across Asia Minor and into the Balkan peninsula, thence\r\njoining the first in the main center of Hallstatt civilization, east\r\nof the Alps? The point seems by no means established. Relationship\r\ndoes not prove parentage. Far more likely does it appear that the\r\nKoban culture is a relic or an offshoot rather than a cradle of bronze\r\ncivilization. And even Chantre, ardent advocate as he is of Oriental\r\nderivations, seems to feel the force of this in his later writings,\r\nfor he confesses that Koban is rather from Mediterranean European\r\nsources than that Europe is from Koban. Most probable of all is it,\r\nthat both Hallstatt and Koban are alike derived from a common root in\r\nthe neighborhood of Chaldea.\r\n\r\nIII. _The Hallstatt (or Celtic?) civilization of bronze and iron\r\nroughly overlies the present area occupied by the broad-headed Alpine\r\nrace; yet this type is not always identified with the Oriental\r\nculture. It seems to have appeared in Europe in a far lower stage of\r\ncivilization, and to have subsequently made progress culturally upon\r\nthe spot._\r\n\r\nTo trace any definite connection between race and civilization in\r\nEurope is rendered extremely hazardous scientifically by reason of the\r\nappearance along with bronze of the custom of burning instead of\r\nburying the dead, their ashes being disposed in cinerary urns, jars,\r\nor other receptacles. By this procedure all possible clew to the\r\nphysical type of the people is, of course, annihilated at once. It has\r\nbecome almost an axiom among archæologists that bronze culture and\r\nincineration are constant companions. Wherever one appears, the other\r\nmay confidently be looked for. Together they have long been supposed\r\nto be the special and peculiar attributes of a new broad-headed\r\nimmigrant race from the East. To prove this conclusively is, of\r\ncourse, absolutely impossible for the above-mentioned reason. Of the\r\ntwo, it seems as if incineration would be a more reliable test of race\r\nthan a knowledge of bronze; for burial customs, involving as they do\r\nthe most sacred instincts and traditions of a people, would be most\r\npersistently maintained, even throughout long-continued migrations.\r\nThe use of bronze, on the other hand, being a matter of obvious\r\nutility, and capable of widespread dissemination commercially, is\r\nseemingly of far less ethnic significance.\r\n\r\nTo indicate the uncertainty of proof in these matters, let us suppose\r\nthat the Hallstatt civilization, for example, is the result of an\r\nimmigration of a brachycephalic Oriental civilized race overlying a\r\nprimitive native long-headed one. That seems best to conform to the\r\ndata, which northern Italy at least affords. Suppose the new\r\npeople--call them Celts with the best authorities, if you\r\nplease--brought not only bronze and iron, but the custom of\r\nincineration. Prior to their appearance inhumation was the rule. What\r\nwould be the result if one attempted to determine the physical\r\ncharacter of that people from a study of the remains in their\r\nnecropoli? All the crania to be found in the graves with the precious\r\nobjects of bronze would in no wise represent the people who brought\r\nthat bronze. They burned their bridges behind them at death, and\r\ndisappeared for good and all. And the remains left to the archæologist\r\nwould represent precisely that class in the population which had\r\nnothing to do with the main characteristics of its civilization. And\r\nthen, again, we must bear in mind that the interments in these\r\nnecropoli as a whole, both with burned or buried dead, constitute a\r\nselected type. Neither Hallstatt, Watsch, nor any of the burial places\r\nof their type were open to the great mass of the common people. They\r\nwere sacred spots, far removed among the mountains from any centers of\r\npopulation. Only the rich or powerful presumably had access to them.\r\nThey are no more typical of the Hallstatt people, therefore, than\r\ninterments in Westminster Abbey are representative of the English\r\nmasses. All our data are necessarily drawn from a class within a\r\nclass. Inductions from them must be very gingerly handled.\r\n\r\nThe situation above described seems to prevail almost everywhere in\r\nthe Hallstatt cultural area. Two distinct burial customs denote\r\npossibly two separate peoples, the inhumers being certainly the older.\r\nIn the Hallstatt necropolis, for example, about one third of the\r\ngraves once contained human remains, all the others containing mere\r\nashes. So ancient are these graves that only eight crania from the\r\nhundreds of interments of the first class are available for study.\r\nThese are of a pronounced long-headed type.[H] The modern populations\r\nof this part of Europe are, as we have seen, among the broadest-headed\r\npeople in the world, as are also all the modern Illyrians. Yet from\r\nthe great necropolis at Glasinac in Bosnia, with its twenty thousand\r\ntumuli, the meager Hallstatt returns are amply corroborated.[I] The\r\nancient inhabitants were as long-headed as they are pronouncedly of\r\nthe opposite type to-day. Up in Bohemia and Moravia also, according to\r\nNiederle, the first bronze-age people, such as we know them, were\r\nstill dolichocephalic quite like their predecessors in the pure stone\r\nage. And here also is incineration just about frequent enough to make\r\nit uncertain whether the human remains are typical or not.\r\n\r\nUnder these circumstances, three suppositions are open to us. We may\r\nhold that these long-headed crania of the Hallstatt people are\r\nworthless for any anthropological purposes whatever. This one would\r\ncertainly be tempted to do were the testimony, such as it is, not so\r\nunanimous. Or, secondly, we may assume that these long-headed\r\nHallstatt people belonged to a period subsequent to the appearance of\r\nthe brachycephalic type in western Europe. If we do so, we place them\r\nin the same class with the Teutonic race which so certainly appears\r\nto overlie this one in the later iron age in Switzerland and\r\nthroughout southern Germany; for the Helvetians and the _Reihengräber_\r\nconquerors from the north surely imposed a novel culture, albeit a\r\nmilitant one, upon the long-settled Alpine people, racially speaking.\r\nThe Hallstatt civilization is immeasurably too early to permit of this\r\nhypothesis. At this time the long-headed Teutonic peoples about\r\nScandinavia were certainly vastly inferior in culture, as we shall\r\nattempt to prove shortly. Thus we are forced to the third conclusion\r\nif we admit the competency of our cranial evidence--namely, that the\r\nHallstatt people in this early bloom of civilization in Europe were\r\nallied to the Mediterranean type of the south. No other source for\r\nsuch a dolichocephalic population is possible. Our stock of types of\r\nthis kind is exhausted.\r\n\r\nIt does not require a great credulity to admit of this hypothesis,\r\nthat the Hallstatt people were of Mediterranean type. Were not the\r\nGreeks, the Phoenicians, and the Egyptians all members of this same\r\nrace? One single difficulty presents itself. Over in Italy, throughout\r\nthe valley of the Po, an entirely analogous civilization to that of\r\nthe eastern Alps occurs. Hallstatt and Villanova, Watsch and Bologna,\r\nare almost identical culturally. And yet over here in Italy the new\r\nculture of bronze and of incineration seems to be borne by a\r\nbroad-headed people of the same type as the modern one. Thus, for\r\nexample, at Novilara so long as the bodies were all inhumed, the\r\npeople were of the long-headed Mediterranean type once indigenous to\r\nthe whole of Italy, now surviving, as we have seen, only in the\r\nsouthern half. On the other hand, when incineration begins to appear\r\nin this place, the human remains still left to us are of a mixed and\r\nfar more broad-headed type. It would seem admissible to assume that\r\nwhen the modern brachycephalic Alpine race submerged the native one it\r\nbrought new elements of civilization with it. Many Italian\r\nauthorities, at all events, agree in ascribing the new culture--call\r\nit Umbrian with Sergi, or proto-Etruscan with Helbig--to a new race of\r\nVeneto-Illyrian or Alpine physical proclivities. What they have not\r\ndefinitely proved, however, is that any necessary connection between\r\nrace and culture exists. There is much to show that the broad-headed\r\nrace came in some time before the introduction of the new arts. Even\r\nin the later _Terramare_ period, preceding the Italian Hallstatt\r\nculture, when stone and copper only are in evidence, a change of\r\nphysical type in the people apparently begins, just as also in France\r\nin the neolithic period.\r\n\r\nThe most indubitable testimony that the Alpine race did not appear in\r\nwestern Europe, armed _cap-à-pie_ with bronze and other attributes of\r\nculture, is afforded by the lake dwellings of Switzerland. Here in the\r\npile-built villages of the Swiss lakes we can trace an uninterrupted\r\ndevelopment of civilization from the pure stone age through bronze and\r\ninto iron. Beginning at a stage of civilization about equal to that of\r\nthe ancient Aryan-speaking peoples, judged by the root words known to\r\nus; not only knowledge of the metals, but of agriculture, of the\r\ndomestication of animals, and of the finer arts of domestic life, have\r\nlittle by little been acquired. Equally certain is it that no change\r\nof physical type has occurred among these primitive Swiss, at least\r\nuntil the irruptions of the Teutonic Helvetians and others at the\r\nopening of the historic period. From the very earliest times in the\r\nstone age a broad-headedness no less pronounced than that of the\r\nmodern Swiss prevailed among these people.[J] Here would seem to be\r\npretty conclusive proof that the Alpine race entered Europe long\r\nbefore the culture with which its name has been all too intimately\r\nassociated.\r\n\r\nIn the outlying parts of Europe, perhaps even in Gaul, it is extremely\r\ndoubtful whether any closer connection between race and culture exists\r\nthan in the Alps. It has long been maintained that the brachycephalic\r\npeople of the Round Barrows introduced bronze into Britain. Surely, as\r\nwe have already shown, things point to that conclusion.[K] Beddoe,\r\nDawkins, and other authorities maintain it at all events. Yet Canon\r\nTaylor makes it pretty evident that the new race arrived in Britain,\r\nas it certainly did in Gaul, considerably in advance of any knowledge\r\nof the metals. As for Scandinavia, much the same relation holds true.\r\nBoth race and culture, as we shall see, came from the south, but it is\r\nby no means clear that they arrived at the same time or that one\r\nbrought the other. In Spain, Siret has asserted that bronze came in\r\nthe hands of a new immigrant broad-headed race, but the authoritative\r\nopinion of Cartailhac discovers no direct evidence to this effect.\r\n\r\nThe final conclusions which would seem to follow from our tedious\r\nsummary is this: That the nearly contemporaneous appearance of a\r\nbrachycephalic race and the first knowledge of metals indicative of\r\nOriental cultural influences in western Europe, is more or less a\r\ncoincidence. The first civilized peoples of the Hallstatt period seem\r\nto have been closely allied, both in physical type and culture, with\r\nthe Greeks and other peoples of the classic East. Among them, perhaps\r\nover them, swept the representatives of our broad-headed Alpine type\r\nwho came from the direction of Asia. These invaders may have been the\r\nScythians, although the matter is incapable of proof. Pressure from\r\nthis direction set both culture and population in motion toward the\r\nwest, in much the same way that the fall of Constantinople in the\r\nfifteenth century induced the Renaissance in Italy.\r\n\r\nIV. _The remarkable prehistoric civilization of Italy is due to the\r\nunion of two cultures: one from the Hallstatt region having entered\r\nEurope by way of the Danube, the other coming from the southeast by\r\nsea being distinctly Mediterranean. From these evolved the Umbrian and\r\nthe Etruscan civilizations, followed in the historic period by the\r\nearly Latin._\r\n\r\nThe earliest culture in Italy worthy the name is found in the\r\n_palafitte_ or pile dwellings, in the northern lakes, and in the\r\nso-called _terramare_ settlements in the valley of the Po. The former\r\nare not distinguishable from similar structures in the Swiss lake\r\ndwellings, but the _terramare_ are entirely peculiar to Italy. Their\r\nlike is not found anywhere else in Europe. Briefly described, they are\r\nvillages built upon raised platforms of earth, encircled by a moat,\r\nand generally having a ditch or small pond in the middle, in which an\r\naltar is erected. These complicated structures are built upon the low,\r\nmarshy, alluvial plains along the Po, but show many points of\r\nsimilarity with the true pile dwellings. The people of this early\r\nperiod were in the pure stone age, with few arts save that of making\r\nthe coarser kinds of pottery. From their osseous remains, they seem to\r\nhave been of a long-headed type, quite like their predecessors, who\r\nwere cave dwellers. After a time, without any modification of the\r\nmodes of construction of their settlements, new elements appear among\r\nthese _terramare_ people, bringing bronze and introducing cremation.\r\nAt about the same period, as we have said, the Alpine broad-headed\r\nrace began its submergence of the primitive Ligurian type, leading to\r\nthe formation of the north Italian population as we see it to-day.\r\nThis type surely invaded Italy from the north and northeast.\r\n\r\nFrom the foregoing considerations it will appear that there were two\r\nconstituent streams of culture and also of men here uniting in the\r\nvalley of the Po and on the northern slopes of the Apennines.\r\nPossibly, as Chantre affirms, these two streams were from a common\r\nOriental source, here being reunited after long and independent\r\nmigrations. At all events, a remarkable advance in culture speedily\r\nensued, superior to either of those from which its elements were\r\nderived. For the civilization unearthed at Villanova, in the Certosa\r\nat Bologna, at Este, and elsewhere, while in much of its bronze work\r\nsimilar to the Hallstatt types, contained a number of added features,\r\nobviously either indigenous or brought directly from the south. The\r\nHallstatt affinities are especially revealed in the _situlæ_ to which\r\nwe have already called attention. That of Arnoaldi, discovered at\r\nBologna, betrays much the same grade of skill in manufacture as the\r\none from Watsch. Its flat development is shown by the accompanying\r\ncut. The scenes represented are not dissimilar. The boxers armed with\r\nthe cestus, the chariots, and horses closely resemble one another. No\r\ndoubt of a close intercourse between the two regions of Bologna and\r\nAustria can possibly exist.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ARNOALDI SITULA, BOLOGNA.\r\n\r\n(From Revue Archéologique, 1885, vol. ii, Plate XXV.)]\r\n\r\nThe influence of the second or native element in prehistoric Italian\r\ncivilization appears most clearly in the Etruscan period. Etruria,\r\nlying south of the Apennines, was more essentially Italian, as we\r\nmight expect, than the region about Bologna, where the Umbro-Hallstatt\r\nor continental culture flourished. It is easy to note the superiority\r\nin the former case. It is most clearly indicated in the pottery. Here\r\nwe find an art which is truly indigenous to the climate and soil of\r\nthe Mediterranean.\r\n\r\nPopularly, the word \"Etruscan\" at once suggests the ceramic art; the\r\nprogress effected in a short time was certainly startling. To give an\r\nidea of the sudden change, we have reproduced upon page 30\r\nillustrations of typical bits of Italian pottery.[L] The first vase,\r\nprior to the full Etruscan culture, shows its crudity at once, both in\r\nits defects of form and the plainness and simplicity of its\r\nornamentation. Such a vessel might have been made in Mexico or even by\r\nour own Pueblo Indians. In a century or two some teacher made it\r\npossible to produce the sample depicted in the next cut. Perfect in\r\nform, superb in grace of outline, its decoration is most effective;\r\nyet it betrays greater skill in geometrical design than in the\r\nrepresentation of animate life. The dog drawn on the girdle is still\r\nfar from lifelike. Then come--probably after inspiration from Greek\r\nart--the possibilities in complex ornamentation represented by our\r\nthird specimen. Not more pleasing in form, perhaps less truly artistic\r\nbecause of its ornateness, it manifests much skill in the delineation\r\nof human and animal forms. The culture culminates at this point. From\r\nprofusion of ornament and overloaded decoration, degeneracy begins. It\r\nis the old story of the life and decay of schools of art, time in and\r\ntime out, the world over.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: EARLY ETRUSCAN.\r\n\r\nLATER ETRUSCAN.\r\n\r\nGREEK ETRUSCAN.]\r\n\r\nThe advance in culture typified by our vases was equaled in all the\r\ndetails of life. The people built strongly walled cities; they\r\nconstructed roads and bridges; their architecture, true predecessor of\r\nthe Roman, was unique and highly evolved. All the plain and good\r\nthings of life were known to these people, and their civilization was\r\nrich in its luxury, its culture and art as well. In costumes, jewelry,\r\nthe paraphernalia of war, in painting and statuary they were alike\r\ndistinguished. Their mythology was very complex, much of the Roman\r\nbeing derived from it. Most of our knowledge of them is derived from\r\nthe rich discoveries in their chambered tombs, scattered all over\r\nItaly from Rome to Bologna. There can be no doubt of a very high type\r\nof civilization attained long before the Christian era. Roman history\r\nis merged in the obscurity of time, five or six hundred years later\r\nthan this. The high antiquity of the Etruscan is therefore beyond\r\nquestion. But its highly evolved art and culture show that we have no\r\nlonger to do with European origins; to discuss it further would lead\r\nus to trench upon the field of classical rather than prehistoric\r\narchæology.\r\n\r\nV. _The northwestern corner of Europe, including Scandinavia, Denmark,\r\nand the Baltic plain of Germany, throughout the prehistoric period has\r\nbeen characterized by backwardness of culture as compared with the\r\nrest of Europe. It was populated from the south, deriving a large part\r\nof such primitive civilization as it possessed from the south and the\r\nsoutheast as well._\r\n\r\nThat this region was necessarily uninhabited during the Glacial epoch,\r\nlong after the advent of man in southern Europe, is indubitable. It is\r\nproved by the extent of the glaciated area, which extends on the\r\nmainland as far south as Hamburg, Berlin, and Posen, and over the\r\nentire British Isles at the same time.[M] It was by the melting of\r\nthis vast sheet of ice that those high level river terraces in France\r\nand Belgium were formed, in which the most ancient and primitive\r\nimplements of human manufacture occur. In the area beneath this ice\r\nsheet no trace of human occupation until long after this time occurs.\r\nThis fact of itself, is not absolutely conclusive, for glaciation\r\nwould have obliterated all traces of anterior habitation or activity.\r\nAs to the possibility of a tertiary population before the Glacial\r\nepoch, it presents too remote a contingency for us to consider,\r\nalthough we do not deny its possibility. It too far antedates\r\nprehistory, so to speak.\r\n\r\nAt the notable International Congress of Anthropology and Prehistoric\r\nArchæology at Stockholm in 1874 a landmark in these sciences was\r\nestablished by substantial agreement among the leading authorities\r\nfrom all over Europe upon the proposition now before us.[N] First of\r\nall, every one subscribed to the view that the palæolithic or oldest\r\nstone age was entirely unrepresented in Sweden. The earliest and\r\nsimplest stone implements discovered in the southern part of that\r\ncountry betray a degree of skill and culture far above that so long\r\nprevalent in France and Germany. Stone is not only rubbed and polished\r\ninto shape, but the complicated art of boring holes in it has been\r\nlearned. Norway also seems to be lacking in similar evidence of a\r\nhuman population in the very lowest stage of civilization. Stone\r\nimplements anterior to the discovery of the art of rubbing or\r\npolishing are almost unknown. Only about Christiania have any finds at\r\nall been made. In Denmark some few very rude implements have been\r\nfound. They are so scarce as to suggest that they are mere rejects or\r\nhalf-finished ones of a later type. The kitchen middens, or shell\r\nheaps, of Jutland, for which the region is most notable, as described\r\nby Steenstrup, abound in stone implements. They all represent man in\r\nthe neolithic age. Polished stones are as abundant as the rudely\r\nhammered ones are rare. From the absence of all the very early stone\r\nimplements, and from the sudden appearance of others of a far more\r\nfinished type, the possibility of a gradual evolution of culture about\r\nScandinavia _in situ_ is denied on all hands. The art of working stone\r\nhas surely been introduced from some more favored region. The only\r\nplace to look for the source of this culture is to the south.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FLINT DAGGER.\r\n\r\n(From Montelius, 1895 b.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: STONE AXE.\r\n\r\n(From Montelius, 1895 b.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BRONZE AXE.\r\n\r\n(From Montelius, 1895 b.)]\r\n\r\nTardy in its human occupation and its stone culture, Scandinavia was\r\nstill more backward, as compared with the rest of Europe, in its\r\ntransition to the age of bronze. This is all the more remarkable in\r\nview of the rich store of raw materials on every hand. Nowhere else in\r\nEurope does the pure stone age seem to have been so unduly protracted.\r\nA necessary consequence of this was that stone-working reached a\r\nhigher stage of evolution here than anywhere else in the world save in\r\nAmerica. In other parts of Europe the discovery of metal-working, of\r\ncourse, immediately put an end to all progress in this direction. The\r\nultimate degree of skill to which they attained is represented in the\r\naccompanying cuts. The first, a flint poniard, shows the\r\npossibilities, both in the line of form and finish, of manufacture by\r\nthe chipping process. To equal this example one must look to the most\r\nskillful of the American Indians, as in Tennessee, where they were\r\ntoo remote from mines of native copper to make use of a ready\r\nsubstitute for stone. Our second implement is an axe hammer, made of\r\ndiorite. To shape, sharpen, bore, and polish a piece of stone like\r\nthis certainly required a long apprenticeship in the art.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BRONZE BRACELET: 650-500 B. C. (From Montelius, 1895\r\nb.)]\r\n\r\nBronze culture, when it did at last appear in this remote part of\r\nEurope, came upon the scene suddenly and in full maturity. Whether\r\nthis was as early as the eighth to the tenth century, as Montelius\r\navers, is disputed by many. All are nevertheless agreed that evidence\r\nis absolutely lacking that the art was of indigenous origin. From what\r\npart of the world this knowledge of bronze ultimately came we leave an\r\nopen question, as also whether it came with Phoenician traders or\r\ndirect from Greece, as Worsaae affirms. It was certainly introduced\r\ninto Sweden, making its way into Norway about the same time directly\r\nfrom the peninsula of Jutland. Its first appearance is in a highly\r\nevolved state. Such crude attempts at manufacture as Chantre finds so\r\nlong prevalent along the Rhone Valley, for example, are entirely\r\nabsent. Both in form and ornamentation the hand of the master is\r\napparent. This bronze age, like that of stone, lasted a very long\r\ntime--far longer than anywhere else on the continent. Central Europe\r\npassed through three stages of metallic progress while Scandinavia was\r\nevolving two. Not until the second or third century of our era--not\r\nuntil the time of the Romans, it would appear--did iron begin to\r\nsupplant bronze. History repeats itself. The excessive duration of the\r\nbronze age, as in the case of stone antecedently, led to the\r\nattainment of a remarkable skill. The two accompanying cuts are\r\ntypical of the best work of this time. In the one case, merely\r\nsuperficial ornament, especially the skillful use of the spiral; in\r\nthe other, real beauty of form in the bracelet, are clearly apparent.\r\nPossessed of such skill in the working of bronze, it is small wonder\r\nthat the need of a better metal was not felt. Only when fashioned into\r\nweapons of war does iron reveal its supremacy over bronze. This, of\r\ncourse, with the campaigns of historical times, brings us to the end\r\nof our chronicle.\r\n\r\nThe prehistoric experience of metal-working in Scandinavia is typical\r\nof the other details of its cultural evolution. In its earliest epoch\r\nno trace of domestic animals is present. It is rather a remarkable\r\nfact that even the reindeer seems to have been unknown.[O] What can\r\nPenka say to this in his positive affirmation that the original Aryans\r\ngot up into Scandinavia, having followed the reindeer from central\r\nEurope north after the retreat of the ice sheet? The fact is,\r\narchæologically speaking, from the evidence furnished by the kitchen\r\nmiddens, that if they ever did this \"they left a fine country, where\r\ndeer were plenty, to subsist upon shellfish on the foggy coasts of\r\nDenmark.\"[P] The entire absence of economic motive for such a\r\nmigration is at once apparent. Men seldom travel far under such\r\nconditions. Quite early, however, even in the stone age, do evidences\r\nof domestic animals occur, to the dog being added the ox, horse,\r\nswine, and sheep. Pottery in a rude form also follows. Finally, and in\r\napparent coincidence with the bronze culture, comes a new custom of\r\nincineration. The dead are no longer buried, but burned. A profound\r\nmodification of religious ideas is hereby implied. It seems to have\r\nbeen at about this time also that our Alpine racial type entered\r\nScandinavia from Denmark, although, as we have already observed, it is\r\nyet far from certain that the new race was the active agent in\r\nintroducing the new elements of culture. All that we know is that they\r\nboth came from the south, and reached this remote region at about the\r\nsame time.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThat the origins of culture in Europe are certainly mixed would seem\r\nto be about the main conclusion to be drawn from our extended\r\ndiscussion. It has an iconoclastic tone. Yet we would not leave the\r\nmatter entirely in the air, nor would we agree with Mantegazza (1884)\r\nin his conclusion that \"Ignoramus\" sums up our entire knowledge of the\r\nsubject. There is some comfort to be drawn even from this mass of\r\nconflicting opinions. Our final destructive aim has been achieved if\r\nwe have emphasized the danger of correlating data drawn from several\r\ndistinct sciences, whose only bond of unity is that they are all\r\nconcerned with the same object--man. The positive contribution which\r\nwe would seek to make is that the whole matter of European origins is\r\nby no means so simple as it has too often been made to appear. It is\r\nnot imperative that conclusions from all the contributory sciences of\r\nphysical anthropology, philology, and cultural history should be\r\nsusceptible of interweaving into a simple scheme of common origins for\r\nall. The order of races, for example, need mean nothing as respects\r\npriority of culture. Nor do the two sciences, philology and\r\narchæology, involve one another's conclusions so far as civilization\r\nis concerned. Language and industrial culture may have had very\r\ndifferent sources; their migrations need stand in no relation to one\r\nanother in the least. Each science is fully justified in its own\r\ndeductions, but must be content to leave the results of others in\r\npeace. Such is the ultimate conclusion to which all the latest\r\nauthority is tending. Only by a careful comparison of data from each\r\nsphere of investigation may we finally hope to combine them all in a\r\ncomposite whole, as many-sided and complex as the life and nature of\r\nman itself.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[A] Advance sheets from The Races of Europe, now in the press of D.\r\nAppleton and Company, to appear in May.

Everybody knows that by heating\r\nthe solid it passes into the liquid state, and that by heating the\r\nliquid it passes into the form of gas or vapor. So also everybody\r\nknows that when the vapor of water is cooled it is liquefied, and that\r\nby cooling liquid water sufficiently it becomes solid or turns to ice.\r\nIn the same way many of the substances that are known to us as\r\nliquids, such as alcohol and ether, can be converted into the form of\r\ngas or vapor by heat. In fact, this is true of most liquids. The\r\ntemperature at which a solid passes into the liquid state is called\r\nits melting point, and the temperature at which a liquid passes into\r\nthe gaseous state is called its boiling point. The boiling point of\r\nwater, for example, is 100° C. (212° F.) in the open air. But the\r\nboiling point varies with the pressure exerted upon the surface. The\r\npressure that we ordinarily have to deal with is that of the\r\natmosphere. If the pressure is increased the boiling point is raised,\r\nand if the pressure is decreased the boiling point is lowered. In\r\ndealing, then, with the conversion of a gas into a liquid, or that of\r\na liquid into a gas, both the temperature and the pressure have to be\r\nconsidered.\r\n\r\nJust as water is most familiar to us in the liquid form, so there are\r\nsubstances that are most familiar to us in the gaseous form. In fact,\r\nthe only gaseous substances that can be said to be familiar to\r\neverybody are the gases contained in the air. The principal\r\nconstituents of the air are nitrogen and oxygen, which form\r\nrespectively about four fifths and one fifth of its bulk. Besides\r\nthese gases, however, the air contains water vapor, carbonic-acid gas,\r\nammonia, argon in small quantities, and many other substances in still\r\nsmaller quantities. For the purposes of this article it is only\r\nnecessary to have in mind the nitrogen, oxygen, water vapor, and\r\ncarbonic acid. Of these, the water vapor is easily converted into\r\nliquid, as, for example, in the formation of rain, while the other\r\nconstituents are liquefied with difficulty. The name \"liquid air\" is\r\napplied to the substance that is obtained by converting the air as a\r\nwhole into a liquid; but in this process the water and the carbonic\r\nacid become solid and can be filtered from the liquid so that the\r\nlatter consists almost wholly of oxygen and nitrogen. A few years ago\r\nthis liquid was obtainable in only very small quantities. To-day,\r\nthanks especially to the efforts of Mr. Charles E. Tripler, of New\r\nYork, it can be produced in any desired quantity, and at moderate\r\ncost. In consequence of this, it has come to be talked about in a\r\nfamiliar way, and many persons have had the privilege of seeing and\r\nfeeling it, and of learning something about its wonderful properties.\r\nThe object of this article is to explain the method employed in the\r\nproduction of liquid air, to give an account of some of its\r\nproperties, and to indicate some of the uses to which it may possibly\r\nbe put.\r\n\r\nIn the older text-books of physics and of chemistry certain gases were\r\nclassed as \"permanent,\" under the impression that these could not be\r\nliquefied, and this impression was based upon the fact that all\r\nefforts to liquefy them had failed. A brief account of these efforts\r\nwill be helpful.\r\n\r\nAmong the so-called permanent gases was chlorine. An English chemist,\r\nNorthmore, first succeeded, early in this century, in liquefying\r\nchlorine. His work was, however, lost sight of, and in 1823 Faraday at\r\nthe Royal Institution showed independently that this transformation of\r\ngaseous chlorine into the liquid can be effected comparatively easily.\r\nThe method used by him is this: When chlorine gas is passed into cold\r\nwater it forms with the water a solid product known as chlorine\r\nhydrate. If kept well cooled this hydrate can be dried. If then its\r\ntemperature is raised even to the ordinary temperature of the room,\r\nthe solid hydrate is decomposed into liquid water and gaseous\r\nchlorine. Faraday put some of the solid hydrate into a stout glass\r\ntube sealed at one end and bent at the middle. The other end of the\r\ntube was then closed. The tube was then suspended so that the two ends\r\nwere turned downward. On gently warming the end in which was the solid\r\nhydrate, this was decomposed into chlorine and water. But the gas\r\ngiven off would under ordinary conditions have occupied a much larger\r\nspace than the solid hydrate. Being prevented from expanding by the\r\ntube in which it was inclosed, it was under very considerable\r\npressure. The end of the tube that was not warmed was cooled, and in\r\nthis end, in consequence of the pressure and the comparatively low\r\ntemperature, chlorine, which is gaseous under the ordinary pressure of\r\nthe air, appeared as a liquid. The general method made use of by\r\nFaraday in this classical experiment is that which is always made use\r\nof for the purpose of liquefying gases, but for some gases pressures\r\nvery much higher and temperatures very much lower are required.\r\nFaraday himself succeeded in liquefying all the gases then known\r\nexcept oxygen, hydrogen, nitrogen, nitric oxide, and marsh gas. He\r\nsubjected oxygen to a pressure of about one thousand pounds to the\r\nsquare inch, or nearly seventy atmospheres, but it showed no signs of\r\nliquefaction. Later experimenters increased the pressure to four\r\nthousand pounds to the square inch, with no better results, so that it\r\nis not surprising that it came to be held that some gases are\r\npermanent.\r\n\r\nWithin comparatively recent years several gases have been liquefied on\r\nthe large scale by means of pressure. These are ammonia, carbonic\r\nacid, nitrous oxide, and chlorine. Ammonia is used for producing low\r\ntemperatures, as in breweries and in cold-storage plants and in the\r\nmanufacture of ice; carbonic acid, for fire extinguishers and for\r\ncharging beer with the gas; nitrous oxide, for producing anæsthesia;\r\nand chlorine in connection with several branches of chemical\r\nmanufacture. The production of low temperatures by means of liquid\r\nammonia and of liquid carbonic acid will be more fully dealt with\r\nfurther on, when the principles involved will be briefly presented. It\r\nis to be borne in mind that these substances are liquefied by means of\r\npressure alone, at temperatures that are easily reached, so that it\r\nappears that by mechanical pressure it is possible to produce low\r\ntemperatures. In 1869 an important fact was discovered by Andrews. It\r\nwas that for every gas there is a temperature above which it is\r\nimpossible to liquefy it by pressure. Thus, if chlorine is at any\r\ntemperature above 146° C. (294° F.) it can not be liquefied. This\r\ntemperature is called the \"critical temperature\" of chlorine. The\r\npressure to which the gas must be subjected at the \"critical\r\ntemperature\" in order that the gas may be liquefied is called the\r\n\"critical pressure.\" In the case of chlorine this is 93.5 atmospheres.\r\nNow, the critical temperature of the gases that were called permanent\r\ngases are very low--lower than could be reached by the means at the\r\ncommand of earlier experimenters. The critical temperature of oxygen,\r\nfor example, is -118.8° C. (-182° F.), while that of nitrogen is -146°\r\nC. (-230° F.). The critical pressures are 50.8 and 35 atmospheres\r\nrespectively. As there is no difficulty in obtaining these pressures,\r\nthe problem of liquefying oxygen and nitrogen and air resolves itself\r\ninto finding a method of producing temperatures below the critical\r\ntemperatures of these gases.\r\n\r\nIt is well known that a temperature somewhat below the freezing point\r\nof water can be produced artificially by mixing ice and salt. The\r\nordinary ice-cream freezer is a familiar application of this method of\r\nproducing cold. Other freezing mixtures that are sometimes used\r\nconsist of calcium chloride and snow, that gives the temperature -48°\r\nC. (-54.4° F.), and solid carbonic acid and ether, that is capable of\r\nlowering the temperature to -100° C. (-148° F.). But even with the\r\nlatter mixture it is not possible to reach the critical temperature of\r\noxygen or that of nitrogen. How, then, is it possible to reach these\r\nextremely low temperatures?\r\n\r\nIn order to answer this question it will be necessary to take into\r\nconsideration certain temperature changes that are observed when\r\nsolids are melted and liquids are boiled, as well as when gases are\r\nliquefied and liquids are frozen. When heat is applied to a mass of\r\nice at its melting point it melts and forms a mass of water having the\r\nsame temperature. Heat disappears in the operation. It is stored up in\r\nthe water. This disappearance of heat that accompanies the melting of\r\nice can be shown in a very striking way by mixing a certain weight of\r\nice with the same weight of water that has been heated to 80° C. (176°\r\nF.). The ice will melt and all the water obtained will be found to\r\nhave the temperature of the melting ice--that is, 0° C. (32° F.). The\r\nwater of 80° C. is thus cooled down to 0° by the melting of the ice.\r\nAgain, when heat is applied to water its temperature rises until the\r\nboiling point is reached. Then it is converted into vapor, but this\r\nvapor has the temperature of the boiling water. During the process of\r\nboiling there is no rise in the temperature of the water or of the\r\nvapor. Heat disappears, therefore, or is used up in the process of\r\nvaporization. Similar phenomena are observed whenever a solid is\r\nmelted or a liquid is boiled. When, however, a gas is liquefied it\r\ngives up again the heat that is absorbed by it when it is formed from\r\na liquid; and so also when a liquid solidifies it gives up the heat it\r\nabsorbs when it is formed from a solid.\r\n\r\nBut it is not necessary that a gas should be converted into a liquid\r\nin order that it should give up heat. Whenever it is compressed it\r\nbecomes warmer. Some of the heat stored up in it is, as it were,\r\nsqueezed out of it. Conversely, whenever a gas expands, it takes up\r\nheat and, of course, surrounding objects from which the heat is taken\r\nbecome colder. Now, it is a comparatively simple matter to compress\r\nair. Every wheelman knows that, and he also knows that the process\r\ncauses a rise in temperature; at least he knows it if he uses a small\r\nhand pump. With large pumps run by steam any desired pressure can be\r\nreached. This is simply a question of securing the proper engines, and\r\nvessels sufficiently strong to stand the pressure. It has already been\r\npointed out that several gases are now liquefied on the large scale by\r\nmeans of pressure. It is to be noted that low temperatures can be\r\nproduced by converting certain gases, such as ammonia and carbonic\r\nacid, into liquids, and by compressing certain gases, as, for example,\r\nair. When liquefied gases are used it is only necessary to allow them\r\nto pass rapidly into the gaseous state, when more or less heat is\r\nabsorbed. This is the basis for the use of liquid ammonia in the\r\nmanufacture of ice. A vessel containing the liquid ammonia is placed\r\nin another containing water. The inner vessel being opened, the liquid\r\nammonia is rapidly converted into the gas; heat is absorbed from the\r\nwater; it freezes. When a vessel containing liquid carbonic acid is\r\nopened so that the gas that is formed escapes through a small valve,\r\nso much heat is absorbed that a part of the liquid carbonic acid is\r\nitself frozen. In this case the substance is present in all three\r\nstates of aggregation--the solid, the liquid, and the gaseous. The use\r\nof a mixture of ether and solid carbonic acid as a freezing mixture\r\nhas already been referred to. Its value depends, of course,\r\nprincipally upon the fact that solid carbonic acid is liquefied, and\r\nthe liquid then converted into gas, both of which operations involve\r\nabsorption of heat.\r\n\r\nWe are now prepared to understand the important experiments of\r\nCailletet and of Pictet, the results of which were published in 1877.\r\nIt should be said that they worked independently of each\r\nother--Cailletet in Paris and Pictet in Geneva. Pictet liquefied\r\ncarbonic acid and sulphur dioxide by pressure. The liquid carbonic\r\nacid was passed through a tube that was surrounded by liquid sulphur\r\ndioxide boiling in a partial vacuum. The liquid carbonic acid thus\r\ncooled was then boiled under diminished pressure in a jacket\r\nsurrounding a tube in which the gas to be liquefied was contained\r\nunder high pressure. When this gas was allowed to escape from a small\r\nopening its temperature was so reduced by the expansion that a part of\r\nit was liquefied in the tube and passed off as a liquid. Cailletet\r\nworked in essentially the same way, but on a smaller scale. Neither of\r\nthese experimenters liquefied oxygen or nitrogen on the large scale,\r\nbut they pointed out the way that must be followed in order that\r\nsuccess may be attained. They destroyed the belief in \"permanent\"\r\ngases.\r\n\r\nLater experimenters in this field are Wroblewski, Olszewski, and\r\nDewar, who have been interested mainly in the purely scientific side\r\nof the problem, while Linde in Germany, Hampson in England, and\r\nTripler in the United States have their minds on the practical side.\r\nNotwithstanding the low temperatures involved in the experiments, a\r\nnumber of heated discussions have been carried on in the scientific\r\njournals touching the question of priority. To the unprejudiced\r\nobserver it appears that all of those named above are entitled to\r\ncredit. They have all helped the cause along, but just how to\r\napportion the credit no one knows. In a general way, however, some of\r\nthe results obtained by each in turn should be given. Wroblewski and\r\nOlszewski have carried on the work begun by Cailletet and Pictet, and\r\nhave produced lower temperatures. In the latest form of apparatus used\r\nby Olszewski, liquid ethylene is used as the cooling agent. Its\r\nboiling point is -102° C. (-151.6° F.). By causing it to boil rapidly\r\nunder diminished pressure a temperature below the critical temperature\r\nof oxygen can be reached. As early as 1891 Olszewski obtained as much\r\nas two hundred cubic centimetres of liquid air by this method. Dewar\r\nhas also made use of liquid ethylene. This was passed through a spiral\r\ncopper tube surrounded by solid carbonic acid and ether. It was then\r\npassed into a cylinder surrounded by another cylinder containing solid\r\ncarbonic acid and ether. A spiral copper tube, which runs through the\r\nouter cylinder and also through the inner cylinder in which the\r\nethylene was boiling under diminished pressure, carried the air. This\r\nwas liquefied and then collected in a vacuum vessel below. Later he\r\nfound that air can be liquefied by using liquid carbonic acid alone as\r\nthe cooling agent. A sectional drawing of his apparatus described in\r\n1896 is given herewith. As he remarks: \"With this simple machine, one\r\nhundred cubic centimetres of liquid oxygen can readily be obtained,\r\nthe cooling agent being carbon dioxide, at the temperature of -79°. If\r\nliquid air has to be made by this apparatus, then the carbonic acid\r\nmust be kept under exhaustion of about one inch of mercury pressure,\r\nso as to begin with a temperature of -115°.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFIG. 1.--LABORATORY LIQUEFACTION APPARATUS OF DEWAR FOR THE PRODUCTION\r\nOF LIQUID OXYGEN, ETC.\r\n\r\nA, air or oxygen inlet; B, carbon-dioxide inlet; C, carbon-dioxide\r\nvalve; D, regenerator coils; F, air or oxygen expansion valve; G,\r\nvacuum vessel with liquid oxygen; H, carbon-dioxide and air outlet;\r\no, air coil; ø, carbon-dioxide coil.]\r\n\r\nThe introduction of the vacuum vessel by Dewar has been of great\r\nservice in all the work on liquefied gases. A vacuum vessel is a\r\ndouble-walled glass vessel, as shown in Fig. 1, G. The space between\r\nthe inner and outer walls of the vessel is exhausted by means of an\r\nair pump before it is closed. The vessel is therefore surrounded by a\r\nvacuum. As heat is not conducted by a vacuum, it is possible to keep\r\nspecimens of liquefied gases in such vessels for a surprisingly long\r\ntime. Heat enough can not pass through the vacuum to vaporize the\r\nliquid rapidly. The most common form of these vessels is that of a\r\nglobe. Such a vessel is known as a Dewar globe or bulb.\r\n\r\nIt has been found that liquid air can be kept very well by putting it\r\nin a tin or galvanized iron vessel, which in turn is placed in a\r\nlarger one, and then filling the space between the two with felt.\r\nUnder these conditions vaporization takes place quite slowly, and it\r\nis possible to transport the liquid comparatively long distances. It\r\nhas, for example, been transported from New York to Baltimore and\r\nWashington. In one case with which the writer is familiar two cans\r\nwere taken from Mr. Tripler's laboratory in the morning, delivered at\r\nthe Johns Hopkins University in the afternoon, and used to illustrate\r\na lecture in the evening. After the lecture there was enough left for\r\ncertain experiments that were carried on during the rest of the night.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 2.--DIAGRAM SHOWING WORKING OF COMPRESSION\r\nAPPARATUS FOR MAKING LIQUID AIR.]\r\n\r\nTripler, Linde, and Hampson have all succeeded in devising forms of\r\napparatus by means of which air can be liquefied without the aid of\r\nother cooling agents than the expanding air. In principle the methods\r\nemployed by these three workers are essentially the same. It appears\r\nfrom the published statements that at the present time Tripler's plant\r\nis the most efficient. While a few years ago a half pint or so of\r\nliquid air is said to have cost five hundred dollars, now five gallons\r\ncan be made for about twenty dollars, and probably much less. The\r\ngeneral working of Tripler's apparatus can be made clear by the aid of\r\nthe accompanying drawing, Fig. 2. A^1, A^2, A^3 represent steam\r\ncompression pumps. Air is taken through I from above the roof of the\r\nlaboratory. In the first pump it is compressed to sixty-five pounds to\r\nthe square inch. It, of course, becomes heated as it is compressed. In\r\norder to cool it down again it is passed through a coil, B^1, which is\r\nsurrounded by water of the ordinary temperature. This compressed and\r\ncooled air is then further compressed in the second pump, A^2, to four\r\nhundred pounds to the square inch. Again it is cooled in the same way\r\nas before by means of water which circulates around the coil B^2. Once\r\nmore the air is compressed, this time in the cylinder A^3, in which it\r\nis subjected to a pressure of two thousand to twenty-five hundred\r\npounds to the square inch; and then this compressed air is brought\r\ndown to the ordinary temperature in the cooler B^3. The air under this\r\ngreat pressure is now passed through the purifier C, where it is freed\r\nfrom particles of dust and to a great extent from moisture. From C the\r\nair passes into the inner bent tube, about thirty feet in length,\r\nuntil it reaches D. This may be called the critical point of the\r\napparatus. Here is situated a needle valve from which the air is\r\nallowed to escape. It, of course, expands enormously, and is\r\ncorrespondingly cooled. This very cold air passes into the space\r\nbetween the inner and outer tubes, and finally escapes at F. The\r\nresult of this is that the compressed air in the inner tube is soon\r\ncooled down so far that a considerable part of the air that escapes at\r\nD appears in the liquid form. This collects in the lower part of the\r\njacket, and on opening the stopcock at E the liquid escapes in a\r\nstream the size of one's finger.\r\n\r\nIn Mr. Tripler's laboratory the liquid is collected in the cans\r\nalready referred to. Although for the reasons mentioned the\r\nevaporation of the liquid is comparatively slow, it is constantly\r\ngoing on, and as the gas formed occupies a very much larger volume\r\nunder the pressure of the atmosphere than the liquid from which it is\r\nformed, it is necessary to leave the cans loosely covered. Otherwise\r\nthe pressure would increase to such an extent as to burst any but the\r\nstrongest vessels. One cubic foot of liquid air gives at atmospheric\r\npressure eight hundred cubic feet of gaseous air.\r\n\r\nLiquid air obtained as described is a turbid, colorless liquid. The\r\nturbidity is due to the presence of solid water and solid carbonic\r\nacid. By passing the liquid through a paper filter the solids are\r\nremoved, and a transparent liquid is thus obtained. This, as already\r\nstated, consists mostly of nitrogen and oxygen in the proportion of\r\nabout four fifths of the former to one fifth of the latter. Though it\r\nshould not be forgotten that this liquid contains argon in small\r\nquantity, besides three or four other substances in still smaller\r\nquantities, as has recently been shown by Professor Ramsay, we may\r\ndisregard everything except the nitrogen and oxygen. Liquid air is a\r\n_mixture_ of these two substances. They are not chemically combined as\r\nhydrogen and oxygen are, for example, in water. This mixture boils at\r\n-191° C. (-312° F.), which is the temperature of the liquid as it is\r\nin the cans. As the nitrogen boils at a lower temperature (-194° C. or\r\n318° F.) than oxygen (-183° C. or 297° F.), more nitrogen is converted\r\ninto gas in a given time than oxygen, and after a time the liquid\r\nthat is left is much richer in oxygen than ordinary air. When liquid\r\nair is poured upon water it, being a little lighter than the water,\r\nfloats, not quietly, to be sure, but in a very troubled way. Soon,\r\nhowever, the liquid sinks to the bottom because the nitrogen, which is\r\nthe lighter constituent, passes into the gaseous state, and the liquid\r\noxygen which is left is a little heavier than water. The experiment is\r\na very beautiful one. A scientific poet could alone do justice to it.\r\nThe beauty is enhanced by the fact that while liquid air is colorless,\r\nor practically so, liquid oxygen is distinctly blue.\r\n\r\nAlthough liquid air has the temperature -191° C. (-312° F.), one can\r\nwithout danger pass the hand through it rapidly. The sensation is a\r\nnew one, but it is evanescent. Very serious results would follow if\r\nthe hand were allowed to remain in the liquid even for a short time.\r\nThe tissues would be killed. So also, it is possible to pass the hand\r\nrapidly through molten lead without injury. In the latter case the\r\nmoisture on the hand is converted into vapor which forms a protecting\r\ncushion between the hand and the hot liquid; while, in the former\r\ncase, the heat of the hand converts the liquid air immediately\r\nsurrounding it into gas which prevents the liquid from coming in\r\ncontact with the hand.\r\n\r\nWhen the liquid is poured out of a vessel in the air it is rapidly\r\nconverted into gas. The great lowering in the temperature causes a\r\ncondensation of the moisture of the air in the form of a cloud. The\r\nsame thing is seen when the cover is removed from a can containing the\r\nliquid. Of course, this liquid does not wet things as water does.\r\nWhen, however, as happened in New York, the lecturer deliberately\r\npours a dipperful of the liquid upon a priceless Worth gown, he may\r\nexpect to hear expressions of horror from the owner. This experiment\r\npassed off most successfully. Every trace of the liquid air was\r\nconverted into invisible gases before the fleeting agony of the\r\nsympathetic audience had passed away.\r\n\r\nThe effects of very low temperature upon a number of substances have\r\nbeen studied, and some of them can easily be shown. Paraffin, resin,\r\nand rubber immersed in liquid air soon become very brittle, and the\r\ncolor of the resin is completely changed. A beefsteak or an onion also\r\nbecomes brittle, and can be broken into small fragments by the blow of\r\na hammer. A similar effect is produced in the case of some metals. Tin\r\nand iron, for example, become brittle, and the tenacity of the iron is\r\ngreatly increased. A copper wire, however, retains its flexibility. At\r\nlow temperatures the electric conductivity of all metals is increased.\r\nIn general, the lower the temperature the greater the conductivity. If\r\na copper wire could by any means be kept cold enough, electrical\r\nenergy could be transmitted by it with but little loss--perhaps none.\r\nMercury is easily frozen by surrounding it with liquid air, and the\r\nsolid thus formed is very hard, though if it is cooled down\r\nsufficiently it becomes brittle.\r\n\r\nAlcohol can be frozen without difficulty by means of liquid air. By\r\nthe aid of the lowest temperatures hitherto attainable it has only\r\nbeen possible to convert alcohol into a pasty mass. The frozen alcohol\r\nis as hard as ice. When alcohol is dropped into liquid air the drops\r\nretain the globular form. When taken out on a platinum loop the flame\r\nof a Bunsen burner does not set fire to it.\r\n\r\nPhosphorescence is greatly increased by cooling substances down to the\r\ntemperature of liquid air. This has been shown by means of water,\r\nmilk, paper, eggs, and feathers. An egg and a feather could be\r\ndistinctly seen in a dark room.\r\n\r\nScarlet iodide of mercury is converted into the yellow variety when it\r\nis subjected to the temperature of liquid air. Some other colors are\r\nchanged under the same circumstances, but not enough is known of this\r\nsubject to warrant a general statement.\r\n\r\nAttention has already been called to the fact that liquid air loses\r\nits nitrogen more rapidly than it does its oxygen, and that, after a\r\ntime, the residue contains a large proportion of oxygen. As combustion\r\nis combination with oxygen, combustion or burning takes place more\r\nreadily in contact with this liquid oxygen than it does in the air. If\r\na lighted match is attached to the end of a steel watch spring, and\r\nthis then plunged beneath the surface of liquid air, the spring will\r\nsoon take fire and burn brilliantly, the sparks flying off for some\r\ndistance in beautiful coruscations. Hair felt, which does not burn in\r\nthe air, burns in a flash when soaked with liquid air. Finally, when\r\nliquid air is confined in any vessel not capable of sustaining an\r\nenormous pressure, say about ten thousand pounds to the square inch,\r\nthe vaporization goes on until the vessel bursts or the stopper is\r\nforced out. It might therefore be used as an explosive without any\r\naddition, but its manipulation is not altogether simple.\r\n\r\nNow for the inevitable question: Of what use is liquid air likely to\r\nbe? This is a perfectly proper question, and yet, if scientific\r\nworkers always stopped to ask it, and would not work unless they could\r\nfind a favorable answer, progress would, to say the least, be much\r\nslower than it is. Most great practical discoveries have necessarily\r\npassed through the plaything stage. Some of the most important\r\ndiscoveries have not even furnished playthings, and have found no\r\npractical applications as this expression is commonly understood. But\r\nthe production of liquid air, while furnishing mankind with a\r\nbeautiful and instructive plaything, seems likely to find practical\r\napplications. We may look for these in four directions, to each of\r\nwhich a short paragraph may be devoted:\r\n\r\nFirst, as a cooling agent. Low temperature is marketable. To be sure,\r\nthe demand for the extremely low temperature that can be produced by\r\nliquid air does not exist to-day, but this concentrated low\r\ntemperature can be diluted to suit conditions. The only question to be\r\nanswered in this connection is, then, What is the cost of cold\r\nproduced by liquid air? It is impossible for any one to answer this\r\nquestion at all satisfactorily at present. It can only be said that\r\nthis is what experimenters are trying to find out. It appears,\r\nhowever, that they are on the way to cheap liquid air, and that as the\r\nprocesses are improved the price will become lower and lower.\r\n\r\nSecond, for the construction of motors. There is no doubt that liquid\r\nair with its enormous power of expansion can be used as a source of\r\nmotive power just as compressed air is. In the case of steam it is\r\nnecessary to heat the water in order to convert it into steam, and to\r\nheat the steam to give it the power of expansion. The cost is, in the\r\nfirst instance, that of the fuel. Given a certain amount of heat, and\r\na certain amount of work is obtained. If liquid air is used, the\r\nproblem is much the same. Engines must be run in order to compress the\r\nair which is to be liquefied. Every gallon of liquid air has been\r\nproduced at the expense of work of some kind. Now, the question arises\r\nat once, What proportion of the work that was put in that gallon of\r\nliquid air in the course of its production can be got out of it again?\r\nIt is certain that all of it can not be got out unless all that we\r\nhave ever learned about such matters goes for nothing. In dealing with\r\nthe problem of the application of liquid air as a source of motive\r\npower we are therefore doubly handicapped. In the first place, we do\r\nnot know the cost of the liquid when produced on the large scale; and,\r\nin the second place, _we_ do not know the probable efficiency of a\r\nliquid-air motor. I say \"we do not know.\" Perhaps Mr. Tripler and the\r\nothers engaged in the experiments on this subject do know\r\napproximately. We certainly can not blame them for not telling us all\r\nthey know at this stage of the work. It is unfortunate, however, that\r\nsuch a statement as was recently published in a popular magazine\r\nshould be allowed to gain currency--apparently with the sanction of\r\nMr. Tripler. The statement referred to is to the effect that ten\r\ngallons of liquid air have been made by the use of three gallons of\r\nliquid air in the engine. If that means that the ten gallons of liquid\r\nair are made from air at the ordinary pressure, the statement is in\r\ndirect conflict with well-established principles. If it means that the\r\nten gallons of liquid air are made from air that has already been\r\npartly compressed, we must know how much work has been done before the\r\nliquid-air engine began. Leaving out of consideration the question of\r\ncost, it may be pointed out that liquid-air engines would have the\r\nadvantage of compactness, though they would necessarily be heavy, as\r\nthey would have to be strong enough to stand the great pressure to\r\nwhich they would be subjected.\r\n\r\nThe third application of liquid air that has been suggested is in the\r\npreparation of an explosive. In fact, an explosive has been made and\r\nused for some time in which liquid air is one of the constituents.\r\nWhen the liquid from which a part of the nitrogen has boiled off is\r\nmixed with powdered charcoal, the mixture burns with great rapidity\r\nand great explosive force. \"To make this explosive, Dr. Linde pours\r\nthe liquid containing about forty or fifty per cent of oxygen on\r\nfragments of wood charcoal, two or four cubic millimetres in size.\r\nThese are kept from scattering under the ebullition of the liquid by\r\nmixing them into a sort of sponge with about one third of their weight\r\nof cotton wool.\" Of course, this explosive must be made at or near the\r\nplace where it is used. It has been in use in the way of a practical\r\ntest in a coal mine at Pensberg, near Munich. It is claimed that the\r\nresults were satisfactory. The chief advantage of the explosive is its\r\ncheapness, and the fact that it soon loses its power of exploding.\r\n\r\nFinally, the fourth application of liquid air is for the purpose of\r\ngetting oxygen from the air. This can be accomplished by chemical\r\nmeans, but the chemical method is somewhat expensive. Oxygen has\r\ncommercial value, and cheap oxygen would be a decided advantage in a\r\nnumber of branches of industry. It will be observed that it is the\r\nliquid oxygen that makes possible the preparation of the explosive\r\ndescribed in the last paragraph. Oxygen as such in the form of gas is\r\nof value in Deacon's process for the manufacture of chlorine. In this\r\nprocess air and hydrochloric acid are caused to act upon each other so\r\nas to form water and chlorine. The nitrogen takes no part in the act,\r\nand it would be an advantage if it could be left out. It is only the\r\noxygen that is wanted. There are many other possible uses for oxygen\r\neither in the liquid or in the gaseous form, but these need no mention\r\nhere.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion it may safely be said that it is highly probable that\r\nliquid air will be found to be a useful substance, but it is\r\nimpossible at present to speak with any confidence of the particular\r\nuses that will be made of it. As work with it is being carried on\r\nenergetically in at least three countries, we may confidently expect\r\nimportant developments in the near future.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY OF THE WEST INDIES.\r\n\r\nBY F. L. OSWALD.\r\n\r\n\r\nII.--BIRDS.\r\n\r\nThe abundance of birds on the four largest islands of the West Indian\r\narchipelago, where indigenous mammals are almost limited to rodents\r\nand bats, has often suggested the conjecture that the ancestors of\r\nthose islanders must have been immigrants from the east coasts of the\r\nAmerican mainland; and that theory seems to be confirmed by two facts:\r\nthe identity, or similarity, of numerous Mexican and West Indian\r\nspecies, and the circumstance that those analogies include so many\r\nswift-winged birds.\r\n\r\nThere are no woodpeckers in the forests of the Antilles, and only two\r\nspecies of large gallinaceous birds, but a prodigious variety of\r\npigeons, swallows, finches, and crows. The _alcedos_ (kingfishers) are\r\nscarce, but the blackbirds so numerous that some of the countless\r\nspecies seem to claim a South American and even transatlantic\r\nancestry. The restless _estornino_ of the Cuban highland forests, for\r\ninstance, might be mistaken for a varnished starling, resembling the\r\n_Sturnus vulgaris_ of western Europe in everything but the more\r\nbrilliant luster of its plumage. The curious _codornilla_, or dove\r\nquail, too, has its nearest relatives on the other side of the\r\nAtlantic, in Syria, Arabia, and the foothills of the Atlas. It builds\r\nits nest on the ground and, judging from its appearance, would seem to\r\nform a connecting link between the doves and small _gallinæ_; but its\r\nwings are those of a pigeon, and with the assistance of a northeast\r\ngale may possibly have carried it across the ocean.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CROWN PIGEON.]\r\n\r\nIn studying the geographical distribution of animals, we may estimate\r\nthe prevalence of special genera by the number of their varieties, or\r\nby the aggregate sum of individuals, and in the latter sense the\r\nmigratory pigeons of our forest States once nearly outnumbered all the\r\nother birds of North America, though the family is limited to five or\r\nsix species. But in the West Indies the _Columbidæ_ predominate in\r\nboth respects. Cuba is a country of wild pigeons as pre-eminently as\r\nSouth Africa is a land of pachyderms and Madagascar of night monkeys.\r\nThe _Columba leucocephala_ (a congener of our ringdove) inhabits the\r\nmountain forests in countless swarms, and at the end of the rainy\r\nseason visits grainfields in such numbers that hundreds are sometimes\r\ncaptured in nets, by means of corn scattered along the furrows.\r\n\r\nA closely allied variety is found in San Domingo, where in many upland\r\nregions a darkey, equipped with a shotgun and a supply of gunpowder,\r\ncan dispense with agriculture and raise a family of anthropoids on\r\npigeon pies and _tortillas_, compounded from the grain found in the\r\ncrops of his victims.\r\n\r\nBut the _tittyblang_ (_tête-blanc_) has scores of smaller and larger\r\ncousins, culminating in the Cuban primate of the family, the splendid\r\n_paloma real_, with its coronet of pearl-gray plumes and dark-blue\r\nwings.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CRESTED CURASSOW.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PORTO RICO PARRAKEET.]\r\n\r\nDucks, too, must number some twenty West Indian species, and one kind\r\nof wild geese often obliged the rice planters to employ mounted\r\nsharpshooters, who galloped up and down the long dikes, yelling\r\nblasphemies, and every now and then enforcing their quotations with a\r\nhandful of buckshot. But, for all that, the planter could think\r\nhimself lucky to gather a sixty-per-cent harvest of the total produce,\r\nfor experience soon enabled the long-necked depredators to estimate\r\nthe target range of the _cazador_ within a dozen yards and take wing\r\nin the nick of time, only to resume their feast at the other end of\r\nthe plantation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: VERVAIN HUMMING BIRD AND NEST.]\r\n\r\nA long-continued process of natural selection has also modified the\r\nhabits of numerous species of West Indian parrots. Four hundred years\r\nago, when Fernan Oviedo superintended the placer mines of Hayti,\r\n_loris_ were so abundant and tame that his assistants often amused\r\nthemselves prowling about a thicket of berry bushes and capturing the\r\nchattering visitors by means of a common ring net. Nestlings could be\r\ntaken from every hollow tree, and often from the thatchwork of\r\ndeserted Indian cabins; but the overconfident specimens came to grief,\r\nand the survivors have learned to give the Caucasian varieties of the\r\n_Simia destructor_ a wide berth. They raise their young in the\r\ncavities of the tallest forest trees, and approach human habitations\r\nonly at dawn of day and sometimes during the noonday heat, when\r\ncreoles can be relied upon to indulge in a _siesta_ nap. In reliance\r\non their protective colors, gray parrakeets frequent the dead timber\r\nof the coffee plantations, while the leaf-green Amazon parrot sticks\r\nto leaf trees.\r\n\r\n\"When they alight on a dry branch,\" says Captain Gosse, in his Jamaica\r\nchronicle, \"their emerald hue is conspicuous and affords a fair mark\r\nfor the gunner, but in a tree of full foliage their color proves an\r\nexcellent concealment. They seem aware of this, and their sagacity\r\nprompts them to rely on it for protection. Often we hear their voices\r\nproceeding from a certain tree, or have marked the descent of a flock,\r\nbut on proceeding to the spot, though the eye has not wandered from\r\nit, we can not discover an individual; we go close to the tree, but\r\nall is silent; we institute a careful survey of every part with the\r\neye, to detect the slightest motion, or the form of a bird among the\r\nleaves, but in vain, and we begin to think that they have stolen off\r\nunperceived, but on throwing a stone into the tree a dozen voices\r\nburst forth into cry, and as many green birds dart forth upon the\r\nwing.\"\r\n\r\nThe gorgeous macaws, on the other hand, seem to owe their color\r\ncontrasts to sexual selection. \"Ya son vencidos los pavos de\r\nIndia\"--\"That does beat a Hindostan peacock\"--exclaimed King\r\nFerdinand, when Columbus introduced those most splendid products of\r\nthe American tropics.\r\n\r\nNor can the exigencies of protection have evolved the glaring colors\r\nof the West Indian hornbill. The _toco_ (toucan), as the Cubans call\r\nthe yellow-billed species, can be descried from a distance of two\r\nhundred yards, and is, indeed, not anxious to be admired at close\r\nrange. Old specimens get as wary as mountain ravens, but, like crows,\r\nbecome ridiculously tame in captivity, and will follow their\r\nproprietors with loud croaks, every now and then opening their\r\nlunch-trap to indicate their desire for refreshment. They are, on the\r\nwhole, the hardiest of all tropical birds, and can weather the winters\r\nof our coast towns as far north as Wilmington, in open-air cages,\r\nowing perhaps to their habit of extending their excursions to the high\r\nmountain ranges of their native land.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE SMALLEST BIRD.]\r\n\r\nEconomical Nature rarely wastes the gift of song on a bird of bright\r\nplumage, but it is less easy to understand why so many feathered\r\nbeauties should have been afflicted with harsh and positively\r\nrepulsive voices. The horrid screams of the peacocks, guinea hens, and\r\nmacaws can hardly be supposed to charm their mates, and are too easily\r\nrecognized to deter their natural enemies. But the roars (there is no\r\nmore adequate word) of some species of hornbills would almost seem\r\nintended to serve the latter purpose.\r\n\r\n\"The voice of the _Buceros bicornis_,\" says Wallace, \"can be plainly\r\nheard at a distance of a mile, so that the amazement of travelers\r\nvisiting its haunts seems explicable enough. Its screams may be\r\ndescribed as something between the bray of a jackass and the shriek of\r\na locomotive, and are not surpassed in power by any sound that an\r\nanimal is capable of making. They re-echo through the hills to such a\r\ndegree that it is difficult to assign the noise to a bird, and are\r\nsometimes kept up so continuously as to become absolutely unbearable.\"\r\n\r\nThe condor and the harpy eagle have not found their way across the\r\nCaribbean Sea, but the West Indies boast three varieties of fish\r\neagles, several species of mountain falcons, and a curious singing\r\nowl, the _oriya_, that chants its serenades in the plaintive strain of\r\nthe whip-poor-will, and is dreaded by the Porto Rico darkeys as a bird\r\nof ill-omen:\r\n\r\n      \"Grita l'oriya: Venga amigo,\r\n      Venga conmigo a mi patria,\r\n      Venga te-digo!\"\r\n\r\nSmall hooting owls abound, and there are four species of sparrow\r\nhawks, one of them not much larger than a finch.\r\n\r\nIt is probably the smallest bird of prey, and there is no doubt that\r\none species of West Indian humming bird is the smallest bird on earth,\r\nthe _Vervain colibri_, of Jamaica, that hides its nest under an orange\r\nleaf, and, though an insect-eater, could be easily overpowered by an\r\nable-bodied bumblebee. In beauty some of the south Cuban species rival\r\nthose of the Amazon Valley, and frequent every flowering shrub from\r\nthe jungles of the coast lands to the highland meadows of the Sierra\r\nMaestra. In Hayti there are parklike plateaus where they often appear\r\nin swarms at a time of the year when the forests of the foothills are\r\ndrenched by the afternoon cloudbursts of the rainy season, and on some\r\nof the smaller Antilles they are seen only during the flowering period\r\nof special plants.\r\n\r\nIn the solitudes of the Morne Range (San Domingo) mountain ravens rear\r\ntheir brood in the crevices of steep rocks, and fiercely attack birds\r\nof prey, not excepting the black-crested eagle, that now and then\r\nvisits the sierras in quest of conies. But the winged constables of\r\nthe highlands rarely leave their mountain reservation. Of\r\nAbd-el-Wahab, the Arabian heretic, it used to be said that \"Mohammedan\r\nzealots shrank in affright from his superior fanaticism,\" and on the\r\nmidway terraces of the Dominican sierras the persecution mania of the\r\ngiant crow yields to that of the great shrike, the _Lanius rufus_,\r\nthat operates pairwise and assails all winged comers with absolutely\r\nreckless courage.\r\n\r\nThe raven of the Mornes seems to be identical with the cosmopolitan\r\nforager that is found in the uplands of the eastern continent from\r\nthe bleak summit regions of the Hindu-Kush to the sierras of Portugal,\r\nand from the Atlas to the Norwegian Alps; but there are several\r\nexclusively West Indian species of the genus _Corvus_, including a\r\nsteel-blue rook that flits about the Cuban coffee plantations and has\r\na curious habit of perching on a stump and talking to itself in a sort\r\nof croaking chuckle for half hours together.\r\n\r\nThe _gallinæ_, as might be expected from their limited wing-power, are\r\nwell represented in the number of individuals, rather than of species.\r\nTurkeys, though abundant in the coast forests of Central America, are\r\nnot found wild in any part of the West Indies, where the perennial\r\npresence of berries would be as inviting as the absence of foxes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE CARIBBEAN ALBATROSS.]\r\n\r\nIn the mountains some species of curassow have, however, developed\r\ninto a stately game bird, the _Oreophasis niger_, or highland\r\n\"pheasant,\" that lays a dozen large eggs, and in its courtship season\r\nbecomes so infatuated that it can be approached and killed with a\r\ncommon walking-stick. The consequent persecution has made it rather\r\nscarce in famine-stricken Cuba, but in Hayti it can still be seen in\r\ntroops of a dozen or more, scratching up the dry leaves of the sierra\r\nforests, or pecking at insect-haunted shrubs, exactly like a flock of\r\nTennessee turkeys.\r\n\r\nThere are also several varieties of true pheasants, and two species of\r\nquail (besides the above-mentioned _codornilla_), and in eastern Cuba\r\nnumerous barnyard chickens have taken to the woods and become so shy\r\nthat it seems a puzzle how their ancestors in the coast range of\r\nBurmah could ever be captured and domesticated. They still practice\r\npolygamy, combined with a system of co-operative housekeeping, to\r\njudge from the number of eggs that are often found in one nest. At\r\nthe approach of an unfeathered biped the hen bird takes wing with a\r\nscreech, and is apt to vanish for the rest of that day. The roosters\r\nare rarely seen, their glaring colors having faded into more\r\nprotective shades of olive and brown, but at dawn of day their shrill\r\nreveille can be heard from afar in the heart of the pathless jungle\r\nwoods.\r\n\r\n[_To be continued._]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINSANE CHARACTERS IN FICTION AND THE DRAMA.\r\n\r\nBY PROF. CESARE LOMBROSO.\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of the things that most strikes one who compares the ancient\r\ntheater, and even the theater of a few years ago, with the modern\r\ntheater, is the enormous difference in the character of the\r\npersonages, and particularly the curious frequency of insane as\r\nprincipal personages in the modern theater. We have come to such a\r\npoint that one may be almost sure that in reading over a new play, by\r\nIbsen, for example, he will find three or four insane personages in\r\nit, if, the characters are not all so. These madmen have\r\ncharacteristics so particularized as to seem as if they might have\r\nbeen depicted by an alienist. If the protagonists are not mad, they\r\nare agitated by such violent and strange passions as the ordinary\r\nworld never meets in life; which it therefore refuses to accept when\r\nthey are described in a scientific book, but nevertheless receives\r\nthem when it sees them in the scenes or meets them in the romances of\r\nthe great modern novelists.\r\n\r\nIbsen, for example, has made a most exact picture of the progressive\r\ngeneral paralysis which arises, precisely as he depicts it, in men of\r\ngenius, of great mental activity, who have wasted their hereditary\r\npower in pleasures or excessive work; and there is in them both\r\nimpulsiveness and want of will power, complete perversion of all the\r\ninstincts, and mental confusion, alternating here and there with\r\ngenial flashes; but he is wrong in accumulating in a single subject\r\nthe maladies of a large number of diseased, and therefore exaggerating\r\ntheir eccentricities--as he exaggerates atavism and heredity of\r\ndisease when he makes the morbid son repeat the same incoherent\r\nphrases as the father from whom he inherits his disorder used.\r\n\r\nJust and true, however, is that other form of heredity under which\r\nfrom a father corrupted by licentious indulgence and by alcohol, and\r\ncriminally vicious, is born, besides a paresic son, a lascivious and\r\ncriminal daughter, who throws herself into prostitution at the first\r\nopportunity without any special cause.\r\n\r\nSo, too, that love of art existing now as only a dream, and that\r\negotistic good nature which enjoys the advantages of a mother's care\r\nwithout gratitude, those short accesses of genial eloquence followed\r\nby fury which burst out from the midst of apathy, and which are\r\ndrowned in the intoxication of alcohol with a complete, immediate\r\nforgetfulness of everything, are specific traits of paralytic\r\ndementia.\r\n\r\nIbsen, in Hedda Gabler, describes to us a neurotic woman who, being\r\npregnant, and therefore suffering more acute attacks, avenges herself,\r\nthough married, upon her former lover, who had left her, by burning\r\nthe manuscripts which he expected to make him famous. Virile, like all\r\ncriminals, she nursed her resentment from youth.\r\n\r\nIn the Pillars of Society the great political characters are rogues\r\nand neurotics.\r\n\r\nIn Berkmann the true criminal banker comes into play. He does not kill\r\nor ravish, but appropriates the money belonging to his bank under the\r\nillusion that he will be able to make great gains with it through the\r\naccomplishment of wonderful things that will secure to him his single\r\njoy--power; and that he can then restore the sum with redoubled\r\ninterest.\r\n\r\nThis case is of a kind of very frequent occurrence, and shows a\r\ncomplete absence in the banker of affection and of moral sense. He\r\nsacrifices the woman who loves him to further the desires of an\r\naccomplice. He has a faithful friend who, robbed by him, continues to\r\nvisit him every day and give him the solace of admiration even when\r\nall despise him; and he repels him when he fails to absolve him and to\r\nbelieve in the possibility of his return to power. Later the defaulter\r\npretends that he has studied his own case, and has probed it in every\r\nway, with the result of a complete acquittal of himself. And why all\r\nthis? Because he has used the money of others for great purposes: to\r\nconnect seas, to excavate the millions that are shut up in the bosom\r\nof the earth and are crying out to be brought into the light. Thus it\r\nis that with the combined genius and delirium of megalomaniacs he\r\nhears the call of the minerals and the groaning of the ships longing\r\nto be set free. Conscience, duty, and probity do not exist for him. He\r\nbelieves that his quality as a man of genius permits him everything;\r\ntherefore he sacrifices to his chimeras the beings who love him most.\r\n\"I am,\" he says, \"like a Napoleon disabled by a shot in his first\r\nbattle\"; and he does not perceive that he has grown old, that he has a\r\nmortal heart disease; and he dreams of returning to power and of\r\nhearing men ask the benefit of his advice, and no longer talks with\r\nanybody, because there is nobody but his old lover who does not\r\nbelieve him guilty.\r\n\r\nFinally, repulsed by all, he plunges into the whirl of life and the\r\ntorment of the mountain, and dies at last of syncope; while his\r\nequally egotistical son deserts the mother who adores him to go to\r\nthe south with the wealthy Amasia, daughter of his father's enemy.\r\n\r\nIn Dostoievski, madmen, especially epileptics, constitute the absolute\r\nmajority of the characters; or else they are born criminals, such as\r\nmy school has attempted to identify by the figures on the hand.\r\n\r\n\"This strange family,\" he writes in The House of the Dead, \"had an air\r\nwhich attracted notice at the first glance.\" All the prisoners were\r\nmelancholy, envious, terribly vain, presumptuous, susceptible, and\r\nformal in the highest degree. Vanity ruled always, without the least\r\nsign of shame or repentance or the least sorrow over the commission of\r\nan offense. Nearly all the convicts dreamed aloud or raved during\r\nsleep. Most usually they spoke words of abuse and slang, talked of\r\nknife and axe. \"We are a ruined people,\" they said; \"we have no\r\nbowels; therefore we cry out in the night.\"\r\n\r\nThis impossibility of feeling remorse or penitence, along with vanity\r\nand exaggerated love of pomp, are characteristics well known to all\r\nobservers. But other traits were manifested perhaps more conspicuous,\r\nand such as are common to children. On feast days the more elegant\r\nones dressed gorgeously, and could be seen parading themselves through\r\nthe barracks. Pleasure in being well dressed amounted to childishness\r\nin them.\r\n\r\nReasoning has no power upon men like Petroff, because they have not\r\nany decisive will. If they have, there are no longer obstacles to it.\r\nSuch persons are born with an idea that moves them unconsciously all\r\ntheir lives hither and thither. They are quiet till they have found\r\nsome object that strongly arouses their desire; then they no longer\r\nspare even their heads. \"More than once have I wondered to see how\r\nPetroff robbed me in spite of the affection he had for me. This\r\nhappened to him at intervals, when he had a strong desire to drink. A\r\nperson like him is capable of assassinating a man for twenty-five\r\nsoldi, only to drink a litre; on other occasions he would scorn\r\nthousands of rubles. He often confessed his thefts to me, lamenting\r\nthat I no longer had the objects, but showed no penitence for having\r\nstolen them; bore reproofs because he thought they were inevitable, or\r\nbecause he deserved to receive them; because I ought to punish him to\r\ncompensate myself for the things I had lost, but thought within\r\nhimself that they were trifles that one ought to be above speaking\r\nof.\"\r\n\r\nFurther on the novelist speaks of the smuggler by profession, a\r\npleasant fellow, condemned for life for his offenses, who could not\r\nlose the instinct for smuggling brandy into the prison. He received\r\nonly a ridiculous profit, was greatly afraid of the rod, although he\r\nhad rarely passed under it, wept, swore that he would not offend any\r\nmore, and then fell down.\r\n\r\nZola also reproduces my epileptic moral madman in _La Bête Humaine_,\r\nin the alcoholic in _L'Assommoir_, the paranoiac in Work, and himself\r\nconfesses to having taken the brief of his immortal chain of romances,\r\nRougon, from a study made by Aubry in a provincial family celebrated\r\nfor its richness in degenerates, criminals, and insane, all derived\r\nfrom a dull, neurotic Keratry.\r\n\r\nDaudet depicts in Jack a series of _mattoidi_, that particular species\r\nof insane which I first discovered, that occupies a position between\r\nparanoiacs, geniuses, and imbeciles.\r\n\r\nANCIENT ROMANCE AND THEATER.--We turn now to the ancient theater and\r\nromance. All the Roman novels of Petronius and Apuleius are rich in\r\nobscene, mythological, and magical adventures, most improbable and\r\nsatirical, without ever defining a character or including a real\r\nmadman.\r\n\r\nIn the ancient Greek theater, while the idea of heredity is\r\ndiscernible under the form of fate, while violent passion is every now\r\nand then depicted under marvelous forms, while anomalies strike us,\r\nand furies of Ajax and Dejanira, of Orestes and Oedipus, and the\r\nmelancholy of Philoctetes, they all still have a common type, which is\r\nnot perceived in ordinary life. They are madmen who do not exist in\r\nany asylum, who seem symbolical, and have little correspondence with\r\nthe men of the mythological and heroic epoch to which they all\r\nbelonged; they never, except in Euripides, present a specific\r\npersonage, nor ever, unless with rare exceptions--as in the Persians\r\nof Æschylus and a few other lost works, like the Siege of\r\nMiletus--deal with contemporary historical facts.\r\n\r\nThese poets were concerned with the symbol, the moral, the tradition,\r\nand, if I may be permitted the term, the blasphemy, the declamation,\r\nrather than with depicting the person. This is further seen in the\r\ncomedy of the Greek decadence, and still further in that of the\r\nRomans, in which, except in the political squibs, the same personages\r\nnearly always appear, as well as showing out of the masks intended for\r\nthe common people--and these figures have come down to us. There are\r\nnearly always the old miser or rake, the go-between slave, the\r\nbraggart soldier. The plots were likewise the same: changed children,\r\nreconciled lovers, except in the Greek political satires, in which the\r\ndemerits of the adversary were exaggerated into the most atrocious\r\ncaricature, and which became like real humorous journals of the\r\npolitical trifles of the day.\r\n\r\nYet these highly cultivated peoples, agitated by grand public\r\npassions, had absorbing, moving controversies--the struggles of the\r\nGracchi, the banishment of Themistocles and Aristides, and the varying\r\nfortunes of Marius, of which no trace is found. Nor, for the rest, did\r\nthe Latins, who were our masters, and were, as we are after them,\r\ncopyists, followers in the footsteps of their Greek predecessors,\r\nreadapt contemporary events to their dramatic lines. We in our turn,\r\ndown to Goldoni and Molière, and even to this very century, have\r\ncopied those ancient comic and tragic writers, warming them up afresh\r\nfrom Orestes and Clytemnestra, and from events which had not the least\r\necho among us. Trissin, Maffei, and Alfieri delineated more or less,\r\non one side tyrants, on the other tyrannicides, which have little to\r\ndistinguish them from one another. So in Schiller and Goethe, all the\r\npassions are of the scene rather than of personages. Thus Faust, for\r\nexample, and Margaret, are not persons who have a special character.\r\nThey are, in fact, personages who cover a symbol, who would tell the\r\nstory of literature, the story of the beautiful, the skepticism of\r\nknowledge, but they tell it with a number of interesting, moving\r\nfacts, without delineating an individuality. Faust is neither very\r\ngood nor very bad, since he with his easy way of speaking commits\r\nrogueries of every kind till finally he is redeemed. He is a\r\nscientific student with a passion for investigation, but in his\r\nenthusiasm, instigated by the devil or by doubt, he too often deserts\r\nthe search for the truth for that of pleasure, too often forsakes the\r\nstudies that had ennobled his life from youth, and as a man to enjoy\r\nthe nights of the Brocken, and worse, the favors of Margaret, of\r\nHelen, till the moment when he redeems himself by saving a people; but\r\nhe does this at the last instant, when he is about to die, and has\r\nnothing more to enjoy. Margaret, too, is a child like other children,\r\nwho, like so many others, suffers herself to be beguiled by manly\r\nbeauty, and has no good qualities except that of being able to die\r\nwith fortitude, hoping with the penalty to expiate the sin, which is,\r\nin fact, more the devil's than hers.\r\n\r\nThe elder Dumas invented an immense diverting confusion of facts, but\r\nhis personages are always the same, and are the occasion, the\r\ninstrument, the setting of the adventures.\r\n\r\nTHE REASONS FOR THIS ABSENCE.--The inquiry into the reasons of this\r\nabsence of insane persons in the older romances and dramas is a\r\ncurious one. The first cause lies evidently in the law of proceeding\r\nin every organism as in every work from the simple to the complex. As\r\nin penal law, not the criminal but the crime was studied at first,\r\nwhile now both are studied together; as in primordial medicine only\r\nthe disease was studied, while now the patient is studied first of\r\nall; so in the drama and in comedy, in the measure that the thought\r\nhas become discriminating, it has substituted or rather associated\r\nwith observation of the fact _per se_, that of the author of the fact.\r\nThe study, of course, exacts more acumen, but it also better satisfies\r\nour reinvigorated culture and opens broader horizons to us.\r\n\r\nWe have thus done more than abandon the pedantesque scale of the old\r\ntime and the mere study of the fact; we have introduced characters\r\ninto the personages, which, while they correspond to living and real\r\ncharacters that we have under our eyes, attempt to resolve a problem\r\nand teach us a moral, and go so far as to represent to us a symbolical\r\nidea which is a pure abstraction of the author's, reaching thence the\r\nmaximum of complication.\r\n\r\nNaturally, such salient characters as madmen, eccentrics, and\r\ncriminals would not be likely to escape the notice of the dramatist,\r\nwho finds in them motives for great effects without departing from\r\ntruth and probability.\r\n\r\nBut there is another more material reason for the recent introduction\r\nof insane characters into the theater, and for their greater frequency\r\nand participation in real life. It has been remarked that insane\r\npersons have multiplied a hundredfold with civilization, to such an\r\nextent that where a few years ago one madhouse was enough, now five\r\nhundred and six are needed. Taking, for example, the statistics of the\r\nmost progressive country in the world, those of the United States,\r\nfurnished by its invaluable census report,[A] we see that the number\r\nof insane persons, which was 15,610 in 1850, 24,042 in 1860, and\r\n37,432 in 1870, rose in 1880 to 91,994; while the population, from\r\n23,191,876 in 1850, increased to 38,558,371 in 1870, to 50,155,783 in\r\n1880--that is, while the population doubled in a little more than\r\nthirty years, the insane increased sixfold; so, in the last decade the\r\nincrease in population was thirty per cent, and that of insane one\r\nhundred and fifty-five per cent.\r\n\r\nIn France[B] there were 131.1 insane per 100,000 inhabitants in 1883,\r\n133 in 1884, 136 in 1888. These figures indicate that the number of\r\ninsane is larger in the most civilized countries, and is increasing\r\nevery year. It may indeed be said that many of these insane are not\r\nproduced but are only revealed by civilization, and that the opening\r\nof the large asylums has caused a considerable number to be brought\r\ninto the light who were not known of before. It is true that the\r\ngreater care we give now to the insane, as well as to consumptives,\r\nmakes them longer-lived. And it is true that as the mind grows\r\nenlightened criminals come to be regarded as insane and thus increase\r\nthe apparent number of such. But all this is not sufficient to explain\r\na doubling in a decade, a tenfold increase in twenty years.\r\n\r\nWe know, too, that civilization has brought on the development of new\r\nforms of disease, which hardly existed before. For example, general\r\nprogressive paralysis was formerly so rare that no special name was\r\ngiven to it till our time, while now it forms the larger quota of the\r\nmaladies of the wealthy, of thinkers, and of military men. Epilepsy\r\nhas greatly increased in its psychical form, so that what are called\r\npsychical and obscure epilepsy are a revelation of our times, and that\r\nits close association with crime (which I believe to be one of the\r\nsure facts of modern psychiatry) is still accepted by only a very few\r\nalienists, not to say that it is rejected with indignation, and, I\r\nwill remark, with profound ignorance, by most modern jurists.\r\n\r\nAlcoholism, too, has taken on enormous proportions. Not that the\r\nancients did not drink, but rather that pure alcohol had not yet been\r\nintroduced; while in the middle ages it passed for one of the most\r\nefficacious remedies--_aqua vita_, living water. Dr. Beard has made a\r\nmost judicious observation in America which I have been able to verify\r\nin Sicily--that there must be a very advanced degree of civilization,\r\nor rather of degeneracy produced by civilization, for inebriety to be\r\ntransformed into that aggregation of disasters, especially of the\r\nnervous system, which is called alcoholism. Now we have not alcoholism\r\nonly, but morphinism, cocainism, all stimuli of the nervous system,\r\nwhich are used by barbarians as potent excitants, but not to the point\r\nof producing stable alterations except in rare cases, like the _amuck_\r\nof the Malays.\r\n\r\nAnd now, we all of us, at least in the capitals and the great centers,\r\nfind ourselves consumed by a feverish activity which makes the mind\r\nlabor much more than Nature intended it should, under which is\r\nproduced all this mass of neurasthenics, hystericals, besides the\r\nmultitudes of moral insane, profoundly egotistical persons, without\r\naffection and wholly directed by a powerful passion for gold, for\r\nwhich they sacrifice everything, even salvation!\r\n\r\nAnd, finally, we have that group of semi-insane, which I call\r\n_mattoidi_, and who are known as _détraqués_ in France and _cranks_ in\r\nNorth America--that is, those who have the livery of genius with a\r\nsubstratum of weakness and the practical cunning of the average man,\r\nwho betray their errors only when they write, who hardly exist save\r\namong males (with a few exceptions, like Michel) and in the great\r\ncenters. I have never seen them in the country. Civilization is now\r\ndepopulating the country and building up the cities, as it is also\r\naugmenting physical excitants with alcoholism, morphinism, etc.\r\nCivilization emblazons the baton of the marshal, and not only of the\r\nmarshal but of the president of the republic, in the eyes of everybody\r\nwho can read and write. Why, then, should we not suppose that\r\ncivilization can further derange the equilibrium of mental labor and,\r\nindirectly, therefore cause an increase of insanity?\r\n\r\nNot only has the number of insane increased, but their importance in\r\nsociety has multiplied fourfold; for which reason we can not fail to\r\ngive them attention. The morally insane in politics and the\r\nmegalomaniac insane in the bank who inspired Ibsen are to be found\r\nwalking around in every country. The blood-criminal, transmuted into\r\nthe forger and the bankrupt, penetrates into our houses, and we suffer\r\nfrom him every day; while the insane man at first was not regarded, or\r\nwas adored under the form of a saint or hated as a wizard, possessed\r\nof the devil always, or seemed a phenomenon strange to society, a\r\nspecies of extraplanetary meteor. If we add that the degeneration\r\nprovoked by the abuses of civilization has begotten a multitude of\r\nforms akin to madness which afford a field for combinations now\r\ntragic, now strangely comic--like the phobia by which one is afraid to\r\ncross a room, or avoids a certain group of words, or refuses to know\r\nhow many doors and windows there are on the street, or can not be at\r\nease without saying sexual pacifying formulas; a class who with their\r\nperverted tastes form a real new world apart; and they all may inspire\r\nnew dramatic settings forth.\r\n\r\nAs a third cause we add that in our age psychology has penetrated into\r\nall departments. There are psychologies of the senses, of the\r\nsentiments, of the will, the psychology of the crowd, of the insane,\r\nof criminals, and finally the psychology of the cell, or at least of\r\nthe infusoria (Binet). Therefore, as statistics is applied to history,\r\nto politics, to religion, in the same way psychology has at last\r\nentered into romance and the drama, and has taken the lion's share.\r\nAnd, far from being repelled by the public, the authors who use it or\r\nabuse it, like Euripides and to a certain point Shakespeare, win the\r\nadmiration of the public; and we are proud to see Zola taking from\r\n_L'Uomo delinquente_ the Jacques of his _Bête humaine_ to make an\r\nimmortal figure of him, and Dostoiewski depicting innate criminals in\r\nhis House of the Dead, and the criminaloid in his Crime and\r\nPunishment; and we do not despise Bourget when, making more a\r\ncaricature of psychology than a psychology, he assumes to apply it to\r\nthe toilets of women and the Parisian _cocottes_ under the form of a\r\npsychology of love.\r\n\r\nIt may at first sight seem a contradiction that we have shown that\r\nthere were also found in antiquity at great intervals dramatic poets\r\nand romancers like Shakespeare, Dante, and Euripides who, led by the\r\nobserving and creative instinct, did not confine themselves to events,\r\nbut studied characters too, and, keenly perceiving the dramatic\r\npotencies in the character of insanity, treasured it up in their\r\nworks. Thus Euripides depicts Helena, vain even into her old age,\r\nsaving a part of the hair she was offering at the tomb of her sister\r\nso as not to lose what remained of her former beauty; and Orestes has\r\nnot the simple bestial fury depicted by Æschylus, but has choreic\r\nmovements, genial intervals, and a tendency to suicide, which show\r\nthat the author had attained a true conception of the maniac.\r\n\r\nIn the Mahabharata the maiden Damaianti is described as made insane by\r\nlove (Book II, st. iii) and Nalo, who, possessed by the demon Kali,\r\nstakes his kingdom on the dice, and, denying his wife, abandons her in\r\nthe wood:\r\n\r\n\"And with soul slave to the thought, discolored face, and all absorbed\r\nin sighs, now lifting up the head, now musing, bereft of sense, you\r\nwould say; a sudden pallor came on. With mind occupied with one\r\ndesire, nor sleep, nor the table, nor the sight of familiar friends\r\nafforded pleasure, nor day nor night gave repose. Ah! poor miserable\r\none! thus exclaiming and bursting into tears, by that lament, by those\r\nsoul-sick acts, she was recognized by her friends.\"\r\n\r\nNiceforus has shown how Dante in his Inferno has delineated in the\r\ndamned the characteristics which my school gives to the born criminal.\r\nShakespeare has done better, and has divined many criminal\r\ncharacteristics through the greater intensity of the crime in the\r\ncriminal woman. Virile even when compared with the criminal man, Lady\r\nMacbeth is crueler than her husband, and, more than that, has many of\r\nthe characteristics of men:\r\n\r\n      \"Bring forth men-children only,\r\n      For thy undaunted mettle should compose\r\n      Nothing but males.\"\r\n\r\nAnd Macbeth, as cool in the crime as the artful contriver of it, is\r\nhysterical and hypnotic, and in the accesses reproduces the acts and\r\nwords of the tragedy, showing that the author knew that hysterics and\r\nsomnambulists often repeat the acts and the emotions which mark the\r\nclimax of their malady.\r\n\r\nHamlet has the folly of doubts and hallucinations, simulates the\r\nravings of a madman, but in his suspicious cunning discovers and\r\nanticipates what is contemplated to his harm, is homicidal through\r\nfear, and is yet often discreet, and a good lover, save that his love\r\nvanishes before the fixed idea.\r\n\r\nIn Ophelia, disappointed love, the contact with a madman or a\r\npretended one, the death of her father almost under her very eyes,\r\nprovoke a species of madness which would now be called mental\r\nconfusion, with vague ideas of persecution, dim recollections of love\r\nbetrayed and of her father, incoherent and confused expressions ending\r\nin automatic suicide. This confirms our conclusions.\r\n\r\nGenius has also anticipated an epoch in the use and abuse of lunatics,\r\njust because time is canceled for genius, because genius anticipates\r\nthe future work of centuries. But on this subject the inquiry is\r\npertinent why, while in the complaisant literary world such creations\r\nas the Argenson of Daudet, the Jack of Zola, and the Eliza of Goncourt\r\nfind, if not an immediate, a kindly and ready acceptance--while all\r\nthe great artists, even the most ancient ones, have given the type\r\nwhich I assign to the born delinquents to executioners and\r\ncriminals--the world has refused to accept the existence of the\r\ncriminal type of insanity in genius, and the relations in criminals\r\nbetween epilepsy and crime which are nevertheless received in romance\r\nand the drama. It is because when we are in the presence of true\r\nfigures, made to move before us under a strong light by the great\r\nartists, the consciousness of the truth which lies dormant in all of\r\nus, smothered and broken under distortion by the schools, reawakens,\r\nand rebels against the conventional forms which they have imposed; all\r\nthe more so because the charm of art has vastly magnified the lines of\r\nthe truth, has rendered them more evident, and has thus much\r\ndiminished the effort required to master them. If, on the other hand,\r\nwe base our conclusion upon cold statistics and what I should call a\r\nskeleton study of the facts, we find the old views rising in confusion\r\nwith those of sentiment and the artistic sense, and we arrive at\r\nnothing.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[A] Compendium of the Tenth Census of the United States, Part II, p.\r\n1659.

But,\r\njudging by the political situation, and taking the armaments as an\r\noutward sign of good intentions, the era of peace and good will among\r\nnations is certainly far off. To get a trading advantage here and a\r\nconcession from a semibarbarous country there is still the ambitious\r\nstriving of the cabinets and the diplomacy of Europe. To give the\r\nstriving emphasis, industry is taxed to the breaking point and labor\r\nto the starving point. Russia exhausts her resources in a railroad\r\nthrough the Siberian waste in her endeavor to obtain an outlet to the\r\nsea, which is jealously closed to her at the southwestern end of her\r\ndominions by England. The trader of Manchester, fearing for his\r\nmarkets, grows frantic at the prospect of Russian cotton goods being\r\nbrought to China or to India. The mere acquisition of a port in\r\nManchuria by Russia threatens to seal his doom. But he might look on\r\nwith complacency. Russia's labor is very dear, capital is dear, wages\r\nare on the Asiatic level, famine still stalks through the land,\r\nintercommunication is made difficult by the lack of roads, and her\r\nwonderful natural resources lie unimproved because the eyes of greed,\r\nlike those of the dog crossing the stream, are turned on the coveted\r\npiece of meat he sees reflected in the water, and to grasp which he\r\ndrops the one he holds in his mouth. France bristles with bayonets,\r\nand is constantly at pains to increase her naval armaments, about\r\nwhose seaworthiness her own minister of marine expresses suspicions,\r\nin obedience to a nervous restlessness for foreign acquisition.\r\nEngland, after her feat in civilizing savages and barbarians in the\r\ncustomary fashion, shown again at Omdurman, is ready to turn her war\r\ndogs on France, because the latter has the temerity to demand a slice\r\nof Soudanese territory. Well might she have given as hush-money, or\r\nfor the mere grace of the action, a few thousand square miles of a\r\ncountry closed to access except by the permission of Great Britain,\r\nwhich has successfully pre-empted every desirable bit of land in\r\nsight.\r\n\r\nGermany, instead of using her newly liberated energies at home in an\r\nendeavor to elevate the miserable condition of her working classes,\r\ntaxes their bread and meat, never too freely supplied, to increase the\r\nsize of her armies and the number of her battle ships. The defense and\r\nexpansion of her colonial empire is her leading thought. A strange\r\nparadox: The workingman and the peasant are overburdened with taxes on\r\nthe necessaries of life, so as to procure markets for a limited\r\nquantity of factory products outside of the field secured in open\r\ncompetition.\r\n\r\nWhile professing friendship and brotherly love, they all have their\r\neyes on their neighbor's throat, fearful only lest the other might\r\nclutch first.\r\n\r\nAs we are in danger of being drawn into this vortex, it is well to\r\nexamine the range of possibilities and see what the trade amounts to,\r\nto obtain which the scientific intellect of Europe and America has\r\nbeen strained to its limits to discover new means of destruction for\r\nattack and defense unknown to the other brothers in the common bond of\r\ncivilization.\r\n\r\nIt is a matter of course that trade among European nations does not\r\ncome within this circle, nor of European nations with the United\r\nStates. It does not depend on battle ships. In the annexed tables I\r\nhave classified the countries in three classes: (1) Independent\r\nstates; (2) colonies of European countries, populated by people of\r\nEuropean stock; and (3) colonies and dependencies of European\r\ncountries, but of non-European stock.\r\n\r\nI have reduced the values of imports and exports of the different\r\ncountries, published in their own currencies, to American dollars. As\r\nthe values are paper currencies, silver currencies, or conventional\r\nvalues, and of fluctuating rates, I have in such instances taken a\r\nyearly average, which will be found in the footnotes of the tables.\r\n\r\n\r\n_I.

Japan has shown her teeth and claws. The\r\nhistory of Poland, Port Arthur, or Kiao-tchow is not likely to find\r\nrepetition on her territory. Only the defenseless tempt the avidity of\r\nthe civilizing nations. The import trade of China, an empire with one\r\nfourth the population of the entire world, is but half as much again\r\nas that of Japan, with but one ninth of the population of the\r\nCelestial Empire. Japan's trade has trebled within the last dozen\r\nyears. Her imports of merchandise are over two dollars _per capita_.\r\nThose of China are thirty-four cents. It will be said that China\r\nparceled out to modern nations will vastly extend in trading\r\nopportunities. So it may. We have, however, national disposition to\r\ntake into consideration. England has devoted her best efforts to\r\nIndia. After a century spent in bringing the various races to\r\nsubmission, the process of \"benevolent assimilation\" is helped along\r\nby a never-ending flow of capital from England. She has become the\r\nteacher and administrator of the people of Hither and Farther India.\r\nIt is doubtful whether under existing conditions any better government\r\nfor their three hundred millions could be devised by any outer force.\r\nThough England does her utmost, as she understands it, to make the\r\npeople under her dominion happy and prosperous, although the rule of\r\nlaw and a degree of local independence are established, yet she finds\r\nsmall thanks from her wards. They have their own notions of happiness,\r\nand seem to prefer misery of their selection to the advantages of the\r\nwhite man's ordering. The fact is, the brown man and the yellow man\r\nhave different notions and desires from the white man. No amount of\r\njostling, pushing, and urging will make them take up our views, our\r\ntastes, our working methods, except in the due development of time.\r\nOur ideas as to necessaries of life and theirs are widely different.\r\nTheir simple needs are easily supplied from native hands, who\r\nunderstand far better than our potters do the clay they have to deal\r\nwith. The progress in trade will not be rapid, and will certainly be\r\ndisappointing to those who expect to see it extend into general lines\r\nof merchandise. The import trade of India and its dependencies (1897)\r\nis $284,000,000, inclusive of Ceylon and the net trade of the Straits\r\nSettlements. This amount, directly catering to the wants of fully\r\nthree hundred millions of people, is but about one third more than the\r\nnet import trade of Australasia, with a population of less than five\r\nmillions of people. The _per-capita_ consumption of imported\r\nmerchandise of the Asiatic possessions of England is ninety-seven\r\ncents; of Australasia, $41.66. I must say here in explanation that the\r\nvalues of importations of merchandise, as published in the English\r\nreturns and lately reproduced by the Bureau of Statistics of the\r\nTreasury Department, Colonial Systems of the World, is $305,000,000,\r\nwhich would make a showing of $63.33 _per capita_. But in the English\r\nreturns the intercolonial trade figures are included. The Treasury\r\nBureau did not mention this in its publication, and gave thereby a\r\nbasis for erroneous deductions. I have deducted all the intercolonial\r\ntrade figures of imports and exports from the returns of each of the\r\nAustralian colonies, so as to bring the figures to a basis of parity\r\nwith the accounts of Canada, and other colonies and dependencies where\r\nno duplications of this kind are possible. The figures of importations\r\nremaining over are reduced by this process to £40,500,000, or about\r\n$200,000,000--$41.66 _per capita_. The inhabitants of the Anglo-Saxon\r\ncolonies of the world number but seventeen million. Their net imports\r\nof merchandise are $460,000,000. The seven hundred and thirty millions\r\nof Hindu and Mongolian populations import $530,000,000. These are the\r\nlands of fabled wealth. Antiquity and the middle ages dreamed of\r\nriches inexhaustible in connection with their names. To-day still the\r\npopular belief is that the wealth of nations is dependent on the\r\nconduct of direct trade with the far East. The country can not be rich\r\nwhose millions find happiness in a sufficient supply of millet or\r\nrice, whatever the wealth of a small favored class may be. But these\r\nnations were the teachers of the barbarians whose descendants now\r\npopulate America and Europe. The disciples have improved on the\r\nmasters. We have improved the tools which they invented and applied\r\nnew forces of production. We have cheapened the processes of\r\nproduction. We have quintupled, we have decupled time. But whatever\r\nour improvements in the tools, they are still our masters in the work.\r\nAny one who would endeavor to substitute the product of our mills in\r\ncotton, in silk, in wool, in wood, iron, clay, in lacquer, cloisonné,\r\nor enamel, for theirs, and not see at a glance the hopelessness, would\r\nindeed prove his incapacity for grasping the situation. Our best\r\nproducers study with profit the work of China and, chiefly, of Japan,\r\nand are grateful for the inspiration they derive from it. But they do\r\nnot attempt to copy. Neither in color effect nor design could they\r\nstand the test of comparison. Five thousand years have been recovered\r\nfrom the sepulcher under which they had been sleeping. But the oldest\r\ntraces unearthed in the valley of the Euphrates still take us back to\r\nthe farthest East as the originator of what we cover by the term\r\n\"civilization.\" The Mongolian shares the lot of all who have benefited\r\nthe race.\r\n\r\nIf we can not expect great openings for our mill products in Asia,\r\nAfrica is a new field for the civilizing efforts of Europe, and will\r\nrepay cultivating, perhaps. The negro has neither factories nor\r\nworkshops. There at least is an unlimited field for trade expansion.\r\nGermany, the latest comer, with the zeal of all fresh missionaries, is\r\neagerly taking up her colonizing mission. The result is not very\r\nencouraging. There is a fine set of buildings with garden spots and\r\nharbor improvements in the settlement at Cameroon, and a well-stocked\r\ngraveyard of what were once good German boys, victims of the deadly\r\nclimate and of the expansion fever. So far this is the only net\r\nshowing to the credit side of the ledger. The territory in Africa\r\ncovers nearly one million square miles. The possession of such an\r\nempire is worth a sacrifice, apparently, and Germany is not\r\nparsimonious in this direction. The contribution of the German\r\nGovernment to the administration fund of the African colonies was\r\n$2,194,000 in 1896-'97. This does not include the expense of\r\nmaintaining the military and naval forces stationed in the African\r\nsettlements. The annual importations of all the colonies amounted (in\r\n1897) to $2,261,000, inclusive of New Guinea. So it costs the\r\nGovernment more than one dollar to enable its citizens to do a\r\ndollar's worth of trade. The population is estimated at 10,200,000.\r\nWhat possibilities stretch out before us, if they could be made to\r\nwear shirts or uniforms like the native police force, which has been\r\norganized at Cameroon! The extent of the territory, however, precludes\r\nthe possibility of successfully conducting the missionary effort to\r\ninduce them to wear clothes. The question also remains open what\r\nreturn could be made, even if the recipients could be brought to\r\nappreciate the advantage of a fuller covering of their nakedness than\r\nthe traditional one.\r\n\r\nFrance is in possession of territories in Africa, the population of\r\nwhich is on a more advanced status. The territories of the Senegal\r\nhave been under French dominion for a period of two hundred years and\r\nmore, and trade relations with the Senegal and Soudan have been\r\nassiduously cultivated. In Asia, Tonquin and Annam were to open the\r\nroad to a very active trade with China. She has held undisputed\r\nlodgment since 1814 in Pondicherry and other towns in India that\r\nremained over to her from her East Indian empire conquered by Dupleix\r\nand abandoned by Louis XV's weak policy. Still, with all the tender\r\ncare and an expenditure for the colonial service, as per budget of\r\n1898, of about 80,000,000 francs, and not counting the colonial\r\nexpense _êtat_ of the ministry of war and of the navy, the entire\r\nexport trade of France to her Asiatic possessions is 35,000,000\r\nfrancs; to her African dominions, outside of Algiers, 22,000,000\r\nfrancs; and to her American possessions, with barely five hundred\r\nthousand inhabitants, 35,000,000 francs. The territories to which this\r\ntrade caters have a population of about twenty-two million in Asia and\r\ntwenty-five million in Africa. If we include the French islands in\r\nAmerica and French Guiana, the exports of French merchandise to all\r\nher colonies amount to about 95,000,000 francs. If we include the\r\nallowance for colonial service from the naval and military budget,\r\nFrance has an expense that exceeds the amount of her colonial export\r\ntrade. How much better off France would be if she would drop this\r\nburden! She could do the same trading and save her money, annually\r\nwasted, and her men annually slaughtered to the mania of colonial\r\nexpansion.\r\n\r\nThe forty-five millions peopling the French possessions in Asia and\r\ntropical Africa consume altogether about $30,000,000 worth of foreign\r\nimports. The French share of this is about $11,000,000, or a little\r\nover one third--eleven millions of trade against fourteen millions of\r\ndirect expense. The contributions to the American colonies are but\r\n$2,000,000, inclusive of about $1,000,000 to the penal establishment\r\nat Cayenne.\r\n\r\nItaly's demonstration of the extent to which this madness can carry\r\notherwise sane statesmen is fresh in everybody's memory. Outside of\r\nRussia, the poor--meaning the working classes--are in no country of\r\nEurope as poor as in Italy. If we take the production per acre in all\r\nthe cereals as a gauge of interior development, then no European\r\ncountry west of Russia, not excepting Spain, is in a more backward\r\nstate. Wise statesmanship would have found here a field for\r\ncultivation sufficiently large to tax all its energies. The peaceful\r\nacquisitions of industry did not satisfy the ambition of the\r\nGovernment. Conquests in equatorial Africa were deemed more essential\r\nto the kingdom's material welfare, but lately freed from the deadening\r\ngrasp of clericalism and absolutism, than the improvement of\r\nopportunities lavishly present at home. What she has cultivated at an\r\nenormous expense of blood and treasure has borne the ordinary harvest\r\nof failure and disaster. The entire import trade of Massowah, to which\r\nthe whole world contributed, and which is largely a transit trade,\r\namounts to about $5,000,000. The expenditure on account of her Red Sea\r\npossessions for the year 1895-'96 is given in the Statesman's Year\r\nBook as 123,738,064 lires ($24,000,000). The contribution to the\r\nmaintenance of this her \"white man's burden,\" from 1882 to 1895, was\r\n303,905,926 lires. At present (1897-'98), after the sobering lesson\r\nreceived in 1896, the net expense is about $3,500,000 (17,000,000\r\nlires).\r\n\r\nThe three powers--France, Italy, and Germany--point a lesson of\r\nunmistakable significance. The figures speak for themselves. No amount\r\nof expense can make the African and the Asiatic consume an appreciable\r\namount of European merchandise. No amount of cultivation can make the\r\ntropics endurable to the northern man. Labor and exertion on his part\r\nunder the rays of a deadly sun and a miasma-breeding soil are entirely\r\nout of the question. Those who would make the endeavor in the manner\r\nof the temperate zone would only succeed the sooner in reaching the\r\nend of white man's settlement in the tropics, disease and death.\r\n\r\nMany point to the Dutch East India settlements as a successful\r\ncommercial enterprise. But, taking the best construction given to the\r\nstory from the trader's point of view, the present satisfactory\r\nconditions have been reached after a great deal of disappointment,\r\nloss, and bloodshed. A large revenue is acquired from Government sales\r\nof colonial produce; still, with all this added to the other revenues\r\nfrom land tax, excise, and other duties, the Government has a\r\ndeficiency of over 10,000,000 florins a year in her East India\r\npossessions. The budget for 1898 shows an expense _état_ of\r\n146,150,164 florins, which is met by a revenue from all sources of but\r\n135,204,203 florins.\r\n\r\nThis is the richest part of the Malay world, and for centuries has\r\nbeen in the possession of Europe's most enlightened people. The\r\nresults, if the _per-capita_ unit of imports and exports is taken as a\r\ncriterion, are not different from those shown in the account of the\r\nPhilippines, governed for centuries by Spain. The loss of their\r\ncolonies is ascribed to the oppressive rule which the Spaniards\r\nexercised. The Netherlands, devoting all their efforts to the\r\ndevelopment of the resources of the islands, at least during the\r\ngreater part of this century, do not show much better results. The\r\nimports _per capita_ of the Dutch possessions are $1.80, and the\r\nexports $2.63. The imports of the Philippines are $1.50 and the\r\nexports $2.63 _per capita_.\r\n\r\nFrom this we may be permitted to deduce that the Malay Islands are not\r\nlikely to prove a more thankful field for cultivation by our traders\r\nthan to the extent indicated in the trade reports set forth above.\r\n\r\nUnder the conditions here delineated, it would be inviting all the\r\nrisks and dangers connected with expansion and colonization, while\r\nnothing is to be gained in a commercial sense that can not be realized\r\nby the means now in our hands.\r\n\r\nAll the ends of trade can be attained without territorial expansion.\r\nThe trade in the hands of peoples under English sovereignty is open to\r\nall commerce on equal terms. Not even the sovereign country, except in\r\nthe recent concessions by Canada, receives a preference. The\r\nprotection of the British flag is tendered gratis to the colonies and\r\ndependencies. The imports of these countries cover about one half of\r\nthe trade of all the world, outside of Europe and the United States.\r\nThough they have but 4.67 per cent of the population, the Anglo-Saxon\r\ncolonies do sixty-nine per cent of the trade of all the colonies and\r\ndependencies of the British Empire.\r\n\r\nSouth and Central America absorb about one fourth--24.6 per cent of\r\nimports and 26.7 per cent of exports--of the world's trade here\r\nsummarized. The colonies peopled by Anglo-Saxon population and the\r\nLatin-American states together, though but 7.3 per cent of the\r\ninhabitants, do an importing trade of 57.4 per cent of the trade of\r\nthe world here reviewed. The countries trading under the protection of\r\nthe British flag and the Latin-American states combined have about\r\nseventy-three per cent of that trade among them. All this trade, as\r\nwell as by far the greatest part of the rest, is incontestably\r\naccessible to-day on an equal basis to all the world. The key to it\r\nlies in the best terms, the best value. The trader and not the admiral\r\ngoverns the field. Prince Heinrich will not succeed better than\r\nAdmiral von Diederichs in convincing China of the advantages Germany\r\ncan offer if Mr. Carnegie's rails are cheaper than Mr. Krupp's. A\r\nwhole fleet of American battle ships will not convince the Asiatics\r\nthat our cotton goods are as desirable as the English so long as the\r\nlatter make goods suitable to their markets, and the Americans offer\r\nonly products calculated to cover the home demands.\r\n\r\nThe golden rule is a more effective trade opener than the cannon's\r\nmouth. Fair and square dealing among nations does not entail expense,\r\nbut brings in good returns. Our national policy, however, has been one\r\nstudiously calculated to array the world against us. Like every policy\r\nin behalf of a selfish interest, it injures the foreign people against\r\nwhich it is directed far less than the nation which devises it.\r\n\r\nThe trade of Australasia, Argentina, and Uruguay, and the Cape is\r\nbased chiefly on wool and hides. The imports of these countries,\r\nnumbering but eleven million inhabitants, amount to $440,000,000,\r\nequaling in amount the trade of China, Japan, Persia, and India, with\r\ntheir seven hundred and fifty million inhabitants. Though but 1.2 per\r\ncent of the population of the world (outside of Europe and the United\r\nStates), their imports are 27.8 per cent of the totals of the figures\r\nin the tables. In exports they do about $400,000,000, or 24.9 per cent\r\nof the total sum of exports here given. It would be worth cultivating\r\nfriendly relations with them. They are inhabited by people of European\r\nstock, and come nearer to the standard of life of Americans than any\r\nof the other nations of the globe. Our latest effort to draw them\r\ncloser to us was the Dingley tariff, with its duty of eleven cents a\r\npound on greasy wool and of fifteen per cent on raw hides. The action\r\ncan not be construed as a very friendly one. But neither is the effect\r\nas calculated by the wise heads who insisted on the provisions of the\r\nwool tariff, the woolen and worsted manufacturers of the East, and the\r\nwool raisers of the West. The wool and woolen trade of America has\r\nsuffered many vicissitudes during the thirty-five years of high\r\ntariffs. It has gone through many periods of depression. But it is\r\ndoubtful whether at any time more disastrous conditions existed than\r\nhave marked the twelve months ending at this writing (March, 1899).\r\n\r\nThe situation can be appreciated from the fact that wool, imported\r\nprior to the passing of the Dingley tariff, is being reshipped to\r\nEngland, where it is bringing better prices than can be obtained here\r\nunder the ægis of the protective duty of eleven cents a pound. Three\r\nand a half million pounds were shipped in the seven months ending\r\nJanuary 31st.\r\n\r\nWe should profit by this experience, try to cultivate friendly\r\nrelations in parts of the world where advantageous trade connections\r\ncan be established, instead of following the _ignis fatuus_ of Asiatic\r\nexpansion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE INTERPRETATION OF NATURE.\r\n\r\nBY EDMUND NOBLE.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is an interesting and suggestive fact in Nature study that at the\r\noutset man was thrown utterly upon himself for the very vocabulary of\r\nthe world-puzzle which presented itself to him for solution. He had\r\nnot only to unriddle his \"inscription in an unknown tongue,\" but to\r\nevolve even the possibility of an explanation out of his inner\r\nconsciousness. His first theories of the universe were based, not on\r\nanything which the cosmos was, independently of him, but upon his own\r\nnature and activities as a living animal. This resort to himself as\r\nhis chief means of interpretation resulted from the very nature of the\r\nknowing process; for knowledge of things is never in any absolute\r\nsense what things are, but is rather what they are like. When we\r\ncognize an object we do it by referring that object to the class of\r\nobjects which in one or more respects it resembles. And as in this\r\nprocess we draw from the objects most familiar to us the principle of\r\nexplanation which we need for the less familiar things that have not\r\nyet become part of our mental possessions, much depends upon priority\r\nin the setting up of mental classes, as well as on the strength of the\r\nimpression which they make upon the mind. The earliest and deepest\r\nclass impressions are necessarily those which arise out of man's\r\nknowledge of himself--of his body and the parts thereof, of his\r\ncorporeal activities, and of his feelings and thoughts; next, of the\r\nbodies of other men and of their movements; finally, in the order of\r\nvividness, of the animate and inanimate objects most nearly related to\r\nhis life. It is these classes which, by virtue of their priority and\r\nstrength, naturally acquire dominating influence over all later\r\nacquirements, and it is to them that the mind refers the impressions\r\ngained from the more remote inorganic world.\r\n\r\nAmong the simpler illustrations of the effort man makes to assimilate\r\nthe external system to himself are those with which we are more or\r\nless familiar in the domain of language. We find them first in the\r\nforms for gender by which, in all inflectional tongues, inanimate\r\nobjects are to this extent likened to living animals. A similar\r\ntendency is at work in the widespread lingual habit of naming things\r\nafter parts of the body, as in the case of \"door,\" called the \"eye of\r\nthe house\" by the native of Banks' Island; of \"son-tree,\" the term\r\napplied by the Siamese to \"fruit\"; of the Malay's use of the noun\r\n\"child\" for \"lock\"; of \"house-belly,\" the African Mandingo's\r\nequivalent for \"in the house\"; and of \"hair,\" often used for \"leaf\" or\r\n\"feather\" in many Melanesian languages.[A] In more modern forms of\r\nspeech the process is suggested by such expressions as the _head_ of a\r\nbridge, the _eye_ of a needle, the _mouth_ of a river, the _neck_ of\r\nan estuary, the _trunk_ and _arms_ of a tree, the _lungs_ of a\r\nbellows, the _bones_ of an umbrella, the _nose_ of a promontory, the\r\n_ears_ of a book, the _fingers_ of a clock, the _legs_ of a table, the\r\n_veins_ of marble, the _foot_ of a mountain. Then there are analogies\r\nbased on the activities of the human body, for when we describe things\r\nas standing, sitting, or lying; as rising, falling, running, or\r\nclimbing--when we use expressions like \"striking clock,\" \"dancing\r\nlight,\" \"sleeping lake,\" \"yawning precipice,\" \"laughing skies,\"\r\n\"babbling brooks,\" \"raging billows,\" we are applying to the objects\r\nnamed terms originally used to describe our own acts. The sense of\r\nhearing, again, is utilized in such expressions as _taube Nuss_ (\"with\r\nnothing in the shell\") and _taube Kohlen_ (\"those which have burned\r\nout\"). So the defect of blindness is objectified in the _cæcum vallum_\r\nof Roman speech, in _ciego_, said in Spanish of cheese that \"has no\r\neyes,\" and in the _blinder Schuss_ of the Germans, whose more familiar\r\n_Augenblick_ everybody recalls. Not less suggestive are the numerous\r\nexpressions which project conceptions of life and death into the\r\nenvironment, such as the _caput mortuum_ (_tête morte_) of chemistry,\r\n_eau vive_ (_Quellwasser_), \"dead water\" (turn of the tide), _todte\r\nFarbe_ and _lebhafte Farbe_, _vivus lapis_ (firestone), \"quicksand\"\r\nand \"quicksilver,\" the \"dead of night,\" \"dead weight,\" a \"dead level,\"\r\nand _todtes Kapital_. Nor must we forget that the reading of vitality\r\ninto inorganic objects, common enough among savages, has by no means\r\ndisappeared from civilized races. Dr. Stanley Hall's inquiries have\r\nshown that out of forty-eight children just attaining school age,\r\ntwenty believed the moon and stars to be alive, fifteen thought a doll\r\nand sixteen thought flowers would suffer pain if burned. One pupil\r\ndescribed the crescent moon as \"half stuck\" or \"half buttoned\" into\r\nthe sky; the spluttering of coals in a fire was called \"barking\" by a\r\ngirl four years and a half old. Miss Ingelow says that when over two\r\nyears old, and for about a year after, she had the habit of\r\nattributing intelligence not only to all living creatures, but even to\r\nstones and manufactured articles.\r\n\r\nThis projection of words originally descriptive of the human body or\r\nof its activities into the objective world of Nature finds its richest\r\nillustrations in poetry,[B] where it may be held to represent less the\r\nelaborate artifice of a cultured mind than one of the most primitive\r\ntendencies of that mind powerfully swayed by emotion. Yet the process\r\nbelongs equally to the more prosaic efforts which man puts forth to\r\nutilize the objects of his environment in the interests of\r\nself-maintenance. One of the earliest of these is seen in the use of\r\nwords describing parts of the body to facilitate the description of\r\nthe external world in its numerical aspects. Thus the Chinese use for\r\n\"two\" certain syllables (_ny_ and _ceul_) which originally mean\r\n\"ears,\" the Hottentots employing the word for \"hand\" in the same\r\nsense. In middle high German the word for \"sheaf\" (_Schock_) signifies\r\nsixty, and is applied in that sense to all kinds of objects. The\r\nLetts, owing to their habit of throwing fish three at a time, employ\r\nthe word _mettens_, \"a throw,\" in the sense of \"three.\" Among the same\r\npeople flounders are tied in lots of thirty, whence has arisen the\r\npractice of designating thirty by the word _kahlis_, meaning \"cord.\"\r\nThe Quichuas attach the significance of ten to the word _chuncu_,\r\n\"heap.\" The Gallas word for \"half\" has been traced to the verb\r\n_chaba_, \"to break,\" and is the equivalent of our own word \"fraction.\"\r\nSo in a large number of languages the term for hand signifies \"five,\"\r\n\"two hands\" meaning ten, and \"man\" (\"two hands and two feet\") twenty.\r\n\r\nA like origin must be claimed for the measures of space and weight\r\nneeded by man in his industrial and commercial activities. The finger,\r\nthe thumb, the hand, the palm, the forearm, the foot--the extended\r\narms, as in the ancient _orgya_, and the extended legs, as in the\r\nmodern yard--have all played a fundamental part in determining the\r\nstandard measures of the civilized world. To the same class belong the\r\n[Greek: gyê], the extent of field that could be worked by a laborer in\r\none day; the _stade_, the distance which a good runner could traverse\r\nwithout stopping to take rest; also measures of time, such as the old\r\ndivision of the day based on the length of a man's shadow.\r\n\r\nThe human body was thus of primary importance as a means of\r\ncomprehending and coming into relations with the external world. But\r\nmen also sought to make the environment intelligible to them by\r\nprojecting into it the images gained from the more general aspects of\r\ntheir life. Such phrases as \"pig of iron,\" \"monkey wrench,\" \"battering\r\nram,\" \"lifting crane,\" remind us of a period in which objects were\r\nactually shaped so as to enable the mind to accommodate itself more\r\ncompletely to the thought of their vitality. The Greek sailing vessel,\r\nfor example, was so constructed--with the body of a bird, with cheeks,\r\neyes, and projecting ears--as to make it seem to the navigators of\r\nthe time as almost alive. And the dolphins, eagles, ravens, and\r\ndragons which threatened England from the prows of the invading Danish\r\nfleet have had their prototypes in almost every nation that has\r\nbetaken itself to the sea.\r\n\r\nNot less suggestive are the more general aspects of the process. Our\r\nancestor called the earth's satellite the \"moon,\" or \"measurer,\"\r\nbecause it served him as a divider of time. The familiar grains of\r\nwheat and barley which he harvested became the units of his measures.\r\nSo the names of his seasons were based on the fall of the leaves, the\r\nreappearance of particular stars, or the periodical inundations upon\r\nwhich he depended for his food. The most primitive method in\r\nchronology is that which enables man to orient himself in the world of\r\ntime by associating particular lunations with vicissitudes of weather,\r\nwith seasonal aspects of vegetation, and with the constantly changing\r\nsights and sounds of the animal world. In the calendar of the\r\nCrees,[C] for example, we find such designations as \"duck-month,\"\r\n\"frog-moon,\" \"leaf-moon,\" \"berries-ripe-month,\" \"buffalo-rutting\r\nmoon,\" \"leaves-entirely-changed,\" \"leaves-in-the-trees,\"\r\n\"fish-catching-moon,\" \"moon-that-strikes-the-earth cold,\"\r\n\"coldest-moon,\" \"ice-thawing-moon,\" \"eagles-seen-moon.\" So in the\r\ncalendars of Central America and Mexico,[D] the months are named\r\nvariously after the arrival of birds, the blossoming of flowers, the\r\nblowing of winds, the return of mosquitoes, and the appearance of\r\nfishes. The Greeks constantly used the movements of birds to mark the\r\nseasons; the arrival of the swallow and kite were thus noted. Hesiod\r\ntells us how the cry of the crane signaled the departure of winter,\r\nwhile the setting of the Pleiades gave notice to the plowman when to\r\nbegin his work. The Incas[E] called Venus \"the hairy,\" on account of\r\nthe brightness of her rays, just as the Peruvians named her the\r\n\"eight-hour torch,\" or \"the twilight lamp,\" from the time of her\r\nshining. One at least of the three portions into which the Greeks\r\ndivided their night received its name--[Greek: peri lychnôn\r\nhaphas]--from the social custom of lighting the lamps at dusk. For\r\nwhole races the departure of the sun made night a time of danger, and\r\nman did his best to lessen the mystery of the heavens by filling their\r\nobscure depths with the figures of animals and heroes, or by likening\r\ntheir shining lines of cosmic cloud to a road or highway for the march\r\nof beings celestial and terrestrial. Thus, for the speakers of\r\nSanskrit the Milky Way was \"The Path of the Gods\"; the Lithuanians\r\ndubbed it \"The Bird Road\"; in Low German it is known as \"The Way of\r\nCows\"; the Cymris associated it with the course of the wind; for\r\nScandinavians it was \"The Road of Winter\"; the Persians viewed it as\r\nthe route along which the straw carrier drew his burden; to this day\r\nthe Winnebagoes call it \"The Way of the Chiefs.\"[F]\r\n\r\nScience itself is indebted to terms and phrases in which outer\r\nrealities are assimilated to the circumstances of the life lived by\r\nman and by the societies which he forms. Such words as \"attraction,\"\r\n\"repulsion,\" \"resistance,\" \"nature,\" \"body,\" \"atom,\" \"current,\"\r\ncontain obviously anthropomorphic elements. The human origin of the\r\nidea conveyed by the term \"inertia\" may be more or less veiled by\r\nunfamiliar Latin elements, yet it is recovered for us again in\r\n_Trägheit_, \"idleness,\" the German form of the word. The phrase\r\n\"natural selection\" contains a teleological element which has more\r\nthan once been used to throw discredit on the process which it\r\ndescribes. And when one observes how persistently such an\r\nanthropopathic expression as \"affinity\" is still applied to chemical\r\nreaction, or with what _naïveté_ the term \"law\" is transferred from\r\nthe realm of human jurisprudence into the domain of natural processes,\r\none ceases to wonder at the constant confusions of outer with inner in\r\nwhich so much of the psychomorphism of the time has had its origin.\r\n\r\nIt would be strange, then, if, seen in so many of man's efforts to\r\ninterpret the inanimate things around him, this process of\r\nself-projection should not also be valid for the larger relations of\r\nhis mental activity to the universe. It is but a step, in fact, from\r\nthe application of anthropomorphic words to the objects and processes\r\nof Nature, to the employment regarding such processes of\r\nanthropomorphic thought. As the child finds the satisfaction of its\r\nfancy in the discovery of some strange face as suggested to him in the\r\ndecorations of the wall paper which surrounds his sick-bed, or in\r\ntracing out from the contours of clothes hung up within range of his\r\nvision the preposterous outline or figure of some human likeness or\r\ncaricature, so the savage, with a deeper purpose born of necessity,\r\ntraces out from the larger patterns of the moving world about him the\r\norganic shapes, embodying will and personality, that are to serve him\r\nas explanations of the external power which touches his existence for\r\ngood or for evil, and which, thus serving him, enable him to come into\r\nrelations with that power. It is the deepest interests of human life\r\nwhich make this process necessary, and it is of the very nature of the\r\nprocess that the characters thus projected into the environment must\r\nalways--throughout the history of human ascent, and at every\r\nparticular stage of it--be closely and definitely correlated with the\r\ndegree and kind of the self-knowledge which is its source.\r\n\r\nThe earliest of the animal characters displaying this correlation,\r\nand used as a means of understanding the environment, could not well\r\nhave been other than that of motion. That by the higher mammals, at\r\nany rate, moving things, even when inorganic, are generally regarded\r\nas alive, is a view rendered probable by a large body of evidence.[G]\r\nBut when man finally appeared on the scene, a new element came in to\r\ncomplicate the merely animal attitude in which vitality was attributed\r\nto inanimate objects in motion. By contemplating the phenomena of his\r\nsubjective life, and observing analogous phenomena in his\r\nfellow-beings--through the consideration of dreams, swoons, even death\r\nitself--our ancestor discovered in himself a character deeper than\r\nthat of vitality; came to recognize that the living creature, animal\r\nand human, possesses an inner principle or essence underlying its\r\nactivities; is not only \"alive,\" but also \"animated.\" At first the\r\nconception of vitality was one with the conception of bodily activity;\r\nat last man learned to differentiate the movements of the body from an\r\ninner essence to which he believed them to be due--learned, in a word,\r\nto distinguish between the corporeal existence and the soul. And\r\nhaving effected this first rude division of the characters of soul\r\nfrom the merely physical attributes of life, our ancestor soon\r\nprojected the new view which he had reached of himself into the\r\nobjects of his environment. The beneficent influences of Nature, so\r\nnecessary to his life, he now invested with the good purposes of the\r\nbetter nature within him; in the maleficent forces of the cosmos he\r\nread the malignant will of his own angry passions.\r\n\r\nBut it is not as mere phenomena that these powers, thus finally\r\nensouled and regarded as personal, can be thought about. In the\r\nbeginning the human mind carries on its mental processes largely with\r\nthe aid of images--recovered images of something seen, heard, felt, or\r\ntasted--and is yet far off from the stage of scientific thought in\r\nwhich abstract concepts take the place of the recovered mental\r\npictures which have been yielded through the senses. Man thus needed\r\nconcrete images with which to think about the personal powers of the\r\nexternal world, and he naturally found them in the animal and human\r\nshapes already familiar to him. Discovering some likeness between a\r\nNature force and some animal, he henceforth associated the two, and\r\nrecalled the image of the animal as the more concrete means of mental\r\nrecovery when he wished to think of the abstract Nature power. Or,\r\nassociating some departed ancestor, relative, hero, or king with the\r\nNature force--an association which would be greatly strengthened by\r\nbelief in the survival of the soul after death--he gradually\r\nconfounded the disembodied human power with the soul of the Nature\r\npower, and through the law of least effort, used the concrete image of\r\nthe departed human being to stand in his mental processes for the much\r\nmore difficult thought of the Nature force. But, whatever the process,\r\nanimal shapes were obviously needed to reduce the Nature powers to\r\nsuch a degree of concreteness as would make it possible for primitive\r\nman to deal with them as objects of thought. And it is not less\r\ncertain that while, for some races, the earliest shapes thus utilized\r\nwere those of the lower animals, the final form for all races was that\r\nof man himself.\r\n\r\nIn the anthropomorphic stage, then, there is the same effort to\r\nunderstand the external system by assimilating it to something with\r\nwhich man is already familiar. The worshiped deities may be many or\r\nfew, numberless as the Nature forces, polytheistic as among the Greeks\r\nand Romans, or one as in the monotheism of the Semite. Man likens them\r\nto himself, attributes to them not only his outward shape, but also\r\nhis failings and virtues, making his Pantheon resemble not only the\r\nsocial order, but also the political system under which he happens to\r\nlive. It is the completeness of this assimilation which made\r\nanthropomorphism the most persistent aspect of man's intellectual\r\ngrowth the world has known. Yet the view could linger only as the\r\npossession of the intellectually slothful and immature. The\r\ninadequacy, the crudeness, of the conception in which Deity was imaged\r\nas a gigantic man gradually forced itself upon the attention of the\r\nmore thoughtful. Increased mental activity, a better acquaintance with\r\nnatural processes, brought the idea of a power above Nature rather\r\nthan merely superior to man; and as the human mind passed from the\r\nconception of the superhuman to that of the supernatural--as,\r\nmoreover, the thought of merely local gods gave way to the idea of\r\ngods not limited in their functions to particular areas--the\r\nanthropomorphic shapes naturally fell away from the powers they could\r\nno longer adequately represent.\r\n\r\nThen other changes, strictly correlated with man's advancing knowledge\r\nof himself, ushered in the latest stage of his attitude toward the\r\nexternal system. For in the same mind which had been compelled to\r\nreject crude anthropomorphism, there had been growing the\r\nconsciousness of man as something more than a mere compound of\r\nvitality, consciousness, and will--something more than a set of bodily\r\nand mental capacities essential to the work of self-maintenance--the\r\nthought that man was the sum of his higher, not of his lower\r\nqualities, that henceforth he must be measured by the activities which\r\nhe carried on in the domain of pure thought. And this recognition of\r\nmental attributes as the most worthy, the most exalted characters of\r\nhuman personality, could not fail to impress itself upon the\r\nconception of deity already undergoing deanthropomorphization. More\r\nand more, therefore, in the higher mind of the race, the Divine Being,\r\nnot only losing his former bodily form, but yielding even the grosser\r\nattributes of personality with which he has been invested, becomes for\r\nthe thought of man a psychical being in the deepest sense of that\r\nterm. Anthropomorphism, or man-likening, passes away, and in its place\r\ncomes psychomorphism, or mind-likening.\r\n\r\nTwo aspects are thus recognizable in the mental interpretation of the\r\nenvironment: on the one hand an aspect which may be called causal,\r\nsince it seeks the source of the power exerted by Nature forces and\r\nobjects; on the other, an aspect which is obviously formal, its main\r\nsignificance being that it condenses, so to speak, groups of qualities\r\ninto a single mental sign. The causal aspect yields, in howsoever\r\nsimple or complex a form, a theory of the cosmos or of its parts; the\r\nformal aspect is no more than a means, ready at hand, in the visible\r\nbodies of animals and men for facilitating the use of that theory in\r\nprocesses of thought. Hence we may regard vitalism, animism,\r\npsychomorphism as so many stages of man's attitude toward the external\r\nsystem, corresponding with the degree of his power to apprehend the\r\nmore abstract as distinguished from the more particular and\r\nsuperficial characters of things that come within the range of his\r\nknowledge. In the first, he explicitly recognizes vitality, the most\r\nobvious character of Nature force; in the second, subsuming vitalism,\r\nhe raises the soul life to the place of honor; in the third, subsuming\r\nboth vitalism and animism, he emphasizes in psychomorphism the highest\r\nhuman qualities which his mind enables him to recognize.\r\n\r\nThe passage from the idea of multiplicity to that of unity is itself\r\nan inseparable part of the total process. As at the beginning man\r\nreads vitality into the separate objects and forces of Nature, without\r\nany thought of their underlying unity, so he regards as discrete,\r\nunconnected, objectively unrelated, the multifarious souls with which,\r\nin his thought, these various powers of the environment have come to\r\nbe animated. But in course of time, by an inner necessity of\r\nintellectual growth, relations come to be perceived between the forces\r\nof Nature, likenesses are recognized between the functions of spirits\r\nand deities--between the powers put forth and the results achieved.\r\nThe result is a process of coalescence which, to describe it in the\r\nbriefest way, first merges a large number of spirit-evolved gods into\r\na smaller number of relatively independent divinities, forms these\r\ninto pantheons of gods each subordinated to a superior, and finally\r\nunites all beings regarded as divine in the single, all-comprehending,\r\nomniscient and omnipotent Deity of monotheism.\r\n\r\nIn all this advance, moreover, we find that the process illustrated\r\nby the changing phases of man's mental attitude toward Nature also\r\nholds good of the multifarious acts by which, in what is known as\r\nreligion, man has sought to realize that attitude in conduct. For, in\r\nseeking to adjust himself to the system of Power, man has been forced\r\nto conceive of his Pantheon in terms as well of his social\r\narrangements as of the political system under which he happened to be\r\nliving. The spirit world of a horde of savages could only reflect the\r\nindefiniteness and disunion of the nomads whose imagination it\r\nsatisfied. But as the household made its appearance, as a definite\r\nsocial structure arose, and the straggling tribes began to be united\r\ninto nations, the gods themselves took on the characters of an\r\nanalogous transformation. The divine selfishness--the \"_remota ab\r\nnostris rebus_\"--long ago satirized by the poet Lucretius, obviously\r\ncorrelated with the attitude of man toward man, just as naturally gave\r\nway, with the growth of the social sympathies, to the thought of that\r\nmore active concern in human affairs which is one of the salient\r\ncharacters of the later phases of monotheism. The original\r\nindifference of Deity toward ethical issues--a widespread feature of\r\nthe earlier religious conceptions--could not but pass away with the\r\nmoral stagnation of the ancient communities out of which it had\r\narisen. So the comparatively new thought of a God definitely\r\nidentified in his aims and activities with the cause of moral reform\r\nis no less obviously a result of the new attitude of man himself\r\ntoward problems of social improvement; while the persistence with\r\nwhich, in human thought, morals remain associated with religion\r\nsufficiently illustrates the extent to which man's view of each has\r\nbeen determined by the self-knowledge which underlies his attitude\r\ntoward both. Note also, finally, the manifest relation in which our\r\nhuman thought regarding mind and body has always stood toward\r\nconceptions of a world-soul, and then the dependence of man's view of\r\nthe relation of God to the world upon the knowledge of his own planet\r\nand of its place in the universe. For as long as our ancestor held the\r\nold geocentric theory of the cosmos--regarded the heavens as a set of\r\nspheres revolving around a flat earth--the thought of a deity outside\r\nthe world related to it as a mechanician might be to a cunningly\r\ndevised piece of clockwork which he had brought into existence, was\r\ninevitable. But when the geographical discoveries of the fifteenth\r\ncentury co-operated with the revelations of Galilei to secure the\r\nfinal triumph of the Copernican over the Ptolemaic theory of the\r\nworld-order, the ancient view of Deity as external to his creation\r\ngave place to the essentially modern conception of his immanence.\r\n\r\nIf now we attentively examine the progress above described, we shall\r\nfind that the earliest attitude of the human mind toward the external\r\nsystem tends in the latest to repeat itself on a higher plane and\r\nwith a richer content. Thus vitalism, by the process of unification\r\nand intensification, culminates in anthropomorphic monotheism, while\r\nanimism, through the coalescence of objects and forces at first\r\nbelieved to be separately animated, finally develops into pantheism.\r\nThese two lines of thought, moreover, tend themselves to converge, or,\r\nat any rate, to become interchangeable, since monotheism, by\r\ndeanthropomorphizing itself, approximates to pantheism, as is well\r\nseen in the Christian theologies and ethical religions of the world;\r\nwhile pantheism, by emphasizing the characters of intelligence and\r\nwill, is sometimes hardly to be distinguished from those modern forms\r\nof monotheism which teach the doctrine of immanence. The intellectual\r\noutcome of the whole movement, embodying the modern attitude in Nature\r\nphilosophy, is thus no longer anthropomorphism, but psychomorphism,\r\nsince it reads into the universe, not the characters which distinguish\r\nhuman beings from the lower animals, but the highest manifestation of\r\nthe characters recognized to be common to both, namely, psychic\r\ncharacters--the characters, in a word, of mind. For the deepest\r\nreaches of human thought, the process of man-likening has thus given\r\nway to the process of mind-likening. On the subjective side of mental\r\ninquiry we get psychomorphic monotheism, or what may be called\r\ntheological pantheism; while on the objective side we reach scientific\r\npantheism, or monism. It is true that the psychomorphism of scientific\r\nmonism is reached by a process different from that which has\r\nculminated in the mind-likening of theological pantheism. Yet in both\r\ncases there is the same projection of intelligence into the external\r\nsystem as a means of comprehending it. And as the intelligence of\r\natoms implies their vitality, we really return in scientific monism to\r\nthe vitalistic attitude of the primitive observer of Nature. The\r\nsalient difference between the two views is this: that while early man\r\nsubsumed under his concept of vitality only the rudest characters\r\nthereof, the terms in the mind of the monist connotes in all their\r\nrichness the ideas associated with mind.\r\n\r\nEnough has now been said to show the basis on which rests the whole\r\nsuperstructure, of man's mental attitude toward the cosmos. Despite\r\nall uncertainties regarding the details of the process, we may be\r\nassured of its fundamental nature, and are thus compelled to recognize\r\nthe dependence of the forms of man's mental attitude toward the\r\nuniverse upon his knowledge of himself. It is because his own actions\r\nhave their source in a personal will that he refers external movements\r\nto will. He is conscious of his own acts, and the world around him can\r\nnot be devoid of a like illumination. Does he himself plan? Nature\r\nmust also be intelligent. And the highest qualities which he can\r\ndiscover in himself he reads unhesitatingly into the cosmos.\r\n\r\nAt first sight, then, knowledge may seem inextricably involved in the\r\nprocess here described. If man can not know the external system to\r\nwhich he must adapt himself save by assimilating it to himself--save\r\nby interpreting it on the basis of analogies which he discovers\r\nbetween his own body and its activities, and the world with its\r\nactivities--are we not committed by our very nature as organisms to\r\nall the errors which that nature imposes upon us? If, in other words,\r\nevery effort to view the universe as it is, independently of us, be\r\nrendered impossible by the very nature of the knowing process, with\r\nwhat chance of success shall we seek to eliminate those vitalistic and\r\npsychomorphic characters which seem to belong to that process as its\r\nvery warp and woof? In reality our knowledge inflicts upon us no such\r\ndilemma. Man is the helpless \"measure of the universe\" only to the\r\nextent that his reasoning processes are undeveloped. That knowledge\r\nmust always have a subjective element is undoubted, but that man must\r\nalways mistake the subjective vesture with which things are clothed by\r\nthe senses for the things themselves is an inference which the whole\r\nhistory of thought negatives. While his life remained simple,\r\nprimitive man could regard appearances as realities without\r\nprejudicing the overplus of utility brought to him by his knowledge.\r\nYet as his relation to the natural surroundings grew in complexity,\r\nthe importance of the reasoning process, with its veto power over the\r\ndeliverances of the senses, began to assert itself. At first accepted\r\nwith little or no demur, these deliverances came more and more to be\r\nchallenged in the interest of self-maintenance; and finally, by\r\nexpansion of a germ possessed by the mind in the beginning, there was\r\ndeveloped that way of dealing with the testimony of appearances which\r\nwe call the objective method. The evidence previously accepted had\r\nbeen, though on the whole useful, in large measure misleading. For in\r\nappearances men saw and felt mainly what Nature was for them, and only\r\nto a minor degree what the external world was for and in itself. The\r\ngreat need of the investigator of Nature is to know what things are\r\nindependently of man, in order to know how they act on one another, as\r\na means of knowing how they will act on the human organism, and how\r\nthat organism may react on them in the interest of its own life. The\r\nprejudice done by implicit reliance on sense testimony arose out of\r\nthe fact that it presented objects as largely unrelated to each\r\nother--as so much being, rather than as so much doing, acting and\r\ninteracting, determining and interdetermining. It became the function\r\nof reason to develop, out of the material furnished by the senses, a\r\nknowledge of the true nature of the system external to man and\r\ninvolving him in its scope which we call universe. In the carrying out\r\nof this function the analogical process has remained, but the\r\nanalogies utilized, from being likenesses between what things seem to\r\nbe to the senses, have more and more become analogies between\r\npropositions made regarding what things do, regarding how things act\r\nupon, are related to and determine each other.\r\n\r\nOur knowledge of Nature, therefore, illustrates progress from a stage\r\nin which external objects are viewed as so much doing--from a stage in\r\nwhich they seem more or less isolated, more or less independent of\r\neach other--to a stage in which we know them as acting and\r\ninteracting, and therefore, by virtue of this action and interaction,\r\nas interrelated and interdependent. It was because man had to begin\r\nwith the thought of the world around him as a series of unconnected\r\naspects that he fell into the error of regarding every object as\r\ncontaining within itself the powers which it put forth; it was by\r\ngradually progressing to the knowledge of the external system as a\r\nprocess that he discovered how inextricably the smallest \"flower in\r\nthe crannied wall\" is linked to its vastest environment, and how\r\ndependent must be the mechanism of the molecule, as well as of the\r\nsolar system, upon the whole universe Power which we call cosmos.\r\n\r\nThus also is it with man's method of interpreting the external world\r\nsystem. At first unable to fully perceive his own relation to that\r\nsystem, as part of his inability to perceive general cosmic relations,\r\nand therefore viewing himself as more or less independent of\r\nNature--as something imposed upon it rather than as something arising\r\nout of it--he naturally sought to force it for purposes of explanation\r\ninto the narrow limits of his knowledge of himself, of his feelings,\r\nhis thoughts, his institutions. But as he grew in the power to\r\ncomprehend his place in the system of things--to understand the way in\r\nwhich the objects and forces of the world were related to each other,\r\ntogether with the way in which he, as knowing organism, was related to\r\nthe universe--he gradually ceased from his vain striving to subject\r\nthe cosmos to himself, and at last learned not only to subordinate\r\nhimself to the cosmos, but to trace to it unreservedly the whole\r\nmethod and meaning of his origin as a living, thinking organism. Man\r\nin the beginning could be no more than the measure of the universe.\r\nThat he has come at last, wielding the objective method, to be its\r\nmeasurer, is the culmination of a struggle between false and true ways\r\nof interpreting Nature which has had the whole history of human\r\nthought for its arena, and for its final triumph the establishment of\r\nthe objective or scientific method of investigation upon impregnable\r\nfoundations.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[A] Codrington.

The labor\r\nquestion, which then commanded so much of our thought, is still\r\nunsettled, and is by no means dwarfed by the subjects now upon every\r\nlip. Rather, as has been shown in an article in a recent number of\r\nthis magazine, this question really forms one of the most important\r\nelements of the present situation, and should not be lost sight of in\r\nshaping public policy. We are entering upon an untilled field as far\r\nas our institutions are concerned, and we have the opportunity to\r\nstart on a higher level in treating the relations of capital and labor\r\nin our new possessions, if we have the wisdom to know how, and the\r\ncourage to do as well as we know.\r\n\r\nIt will help us in a consideration of the present status of the\r\nlaborer and of his future if we study his past, beginning, if not with\r\nAdam, at least with the laborer's entrance into English history as a\r\ndistinct class. Any one at all familiar with Green's Short History of\r\nthe English People will see how much use I have made of that\r\ninstructive and fascinating work. And if I tell only an old story, it\r\nmay still be of value to many of us in recalling facts almost\r\nforgotten, and a help to others whose vision into the past is limited.\r\nBrushing away the cobwebs in the old attic of our father's house\r\nusually brings to light treasures the recollection of which had\r\nslipped from our minds.\r\n\r\nThe free laborer, the man who works for wages, for whom and where he\r\nchooses, did not exist as a class until within about six hundred\r\nyears. In the early days the laborer was tied to the soil where he was\r\nborn. Such a thing as a laborer going about to seek work where he\r\nwould, or having much to say about his master or his wages, was\r\nusually out of the question.\r\n\r\nAt a very early day the towns or boroughs of England had preserved old\r\nrights, or regained them, which the rural part of England had lost,\r\nand in general serfage could not exist there as it did in the country\r\nround them. Trade and manufacture, such as they were in that day, did\r\nnot make the demand for labor which was made by the agricultural\r\npursuits of the country or in the castles of the nobility. So we do\r\nnot find in the towns of the eleventh or twelfth century the large\r\nlabor class we do to-day. In general we may fairly say that the labor\r\nclass began in the country.\r\n\r\nThe manorial system had divided the rural part of England for\r\ncultivation and general order into large estates. The lord of the\r\nmanor occupied a part of the estate for his own demesne and divided\r\nthe rest among his villeins or serfs, who in return were obliged to\r\nrender services to him. It is not necessary for my purpose to enter\r\ninto any long description or discussion of the different relations\r\nexisting between different tenants and their overlord, or the\r\ndifferences existing under Saxon or Norman rule. The general relation\r\nof lord of the manor and his tenants or villeins or serfs is the main\r\npoint to be observed. The villeins or serfs of the manor cultivated\r\nthe lord's home farm or demesne, filled his barn, cut his wood, and\r\ndid all his work. \"These services were the labor rent by which they\r\nheld their lands.\" Some of these tenants, the villeins, were obliged\r\nto work on the lord's demesne at harvest only and to help plow and\r\nsow, while the others, the serfs, to speak in general terms, were\r\nobliged to help on the home farm or in the castle the year round.\r\n\r\nIn course of time the use of a certain parcel of land by the tenant\r\nand a right to pasturage and so forth on the one hand, and the amount\r\nand kind of service required on the other, became definitely regulated\r\nby custom; and instead of the use of the land being a mere indulgence\r\ngiven to the tenant to be taken away from him on any whim of his lord,\r\nit became a definite right in the land which must be respected and\r\ncould be pleaded at law.\r\n\r\n\"The number of teams,\" and so forth, \"the services that a lord could\r\nclaim, at first mere matter of oral tradition, came to be entered on\r\nthe court roll of the manor, a copy of which became the title deed of\r\nthe villein.\" So after a while instead of \"villein\" he became a\r\n\"copyholder.\"\r\n\r\nAs time went on it grew to be customary, instead of rendering services\r\nfor the use of the land held by copyhold, to pay a money rent. In\r\nother words, the system of leasing the little farms came into use, and\r\nfrom that came the tenant farmer. This left the other laborers about\r\nthe lord's demesne or his castle as before. While the class of\r\nvilleins, who did only occasional services, although definite as to\r\namount and time, gradually commuted these services into money\r\npayments, and became farmers, the other serfs still remained on the\r\nmanor, liable to do their work when and where it was customary. This\r\nrise of the wealthier tenants made a new class between the large\r\nproprietors, the lords of the manor, and the tenants or serfs still\r\nbound by custom to work for their lords. But the same process which\r\nfreed the farmer from personal service in time became the chief way of\r\nfreeing the serf also. Until this came about the serf or laborer,\r\nwhatever other rights he might have, and he was not a slave, was born\r\nto his holding and his lord. He could choose neither master nor place\r\nof work. \"He paid head money for license to remove from the estate in\r\nsearch of trade or hire, and a refusal to return on recall by his\r\nowner would have ended in his pursuit as a fugitive outlaw.\" But the\r\nadvance of society silently worked to free the laborer from this local\r\nbondage. The runaway serf gained freedom by residence in a chartered\r\ntown for a year and a day. The influence of the church was directed\r\ntoward his emancipation, at least on all estates outside of its own,\r\nbut the main cause was the growing tendency to commute labor services\r\nfor money payments. As Mr. Green says: \"The luxury of the castle hall,\r\nthe splendor and pomp of chivalry, the cost of campaigns, drained the\r\npurses of knight and baron, and the sale of freedom to a serf or\r\nexemption from services to a villein afforded an easy and tempting\r\nmode of refilling them. In this process even kings took part. Edward\r\nIII sent commissioners to royal estates for the especial purpose of\r\nselling manumissions to the king's serfs, and we still possess the\r\nnames of those who were enfranchised with their families by a payment\r\nof hard cash in aid of the exhausted exchequer.\" The Crusades,\r\nwhatever else they may have accomplished, aided in this freedom for\r\nthe serf. Those costly expeditions dissipated the estates of the\r\nbarons, and, to use Hume's somewhat strained expression, \"Their\r\npoverty extorted from their pride those charters of freedom which\r\nunlocked the fetters of the slave.\" And so, following the rise of the\r\nfarmer, came this new class--the free laborer. By the latter part of\r\nthe fourteenth century labor was no longer, as a rule, \"bound to one\r\nspot or one master; it was free to hire itself to what employer and to\r\nchoose what field of employment it would.\"\r\n\r\nThis is the beginning of the labor class as we know it. In those times\r\nlabor was abundant and therefore cheap. The landowners in the country\r\nand the craftsmen in the town found plenty of help, and the new class\r\nthen coming upon the stage could go where it was needed. From a serf\r\nthe common laborer had become his own master as far as choosing his\r\nown employer and the place of his employment. But just at this time a\r\ncondition of affairs arose which put an end to this state of things.\r\nIn 1348 came the Great Plague. That swept away more than half of the\r\nthree or four millions who then made up the population of England. The\r\nplague and the sudden rise of wages which followed, although coupled\r\nwith an increase in the cost of living, quite naturally brought on an\r\noutburst of lawless self-indulgence which told especially upon the\r\nlaborer looking for work. He easily became the \"sturdy beggar\" or\r\n\"bandit of the woods.\" While harvests rotted to the ground from lack\r\nof hands, in the towns labor was just as scarce and equally as\r\nindependent. The landowners and wealthier craftsmen were startled and\r\nterrified by \"what seemed in their age the extravagant demands of the\r\nnew labor classes.\" Here we have the labor problem at once and at the\r\nbeginning. And from that time to this that problem has been with us.\r\nWith the capitalist one person and the laborer another there has been\r\nalways more or less discord. As Richard T. Ely has somewhere said,\r\nalthough in theory capital and labor should be allies and not enemies,\r\nthe interests of those furnishing capital or labor are not precisely\r\nidentical. But five hundred years ago the labor class of to-day had\r\njust come into existence. It had no organization then, and its members\r\nfew political rights. The landowners and craftsmen could appeal\r\neffectively to the crown and Parliament through their wealth, their\r\npolitical power, and the craftsmen, especially, through their\r\norganizations. The laborer had only himself and brute force. As a\r\nresult, the legislation of that day reflects the demands of the upper\r\nand middle classes only. The laboring class was considered only as it\r\naffected the landowners and craftsmen. So the labor troubles of that\r\nday were met with the Statute of Laborers. \"Every man or woman,\" runs\r\nthis famous provision, \"of whatsoever condition, free or bond, able in\r\nbody, and within the age of threescore years, ... and not having of\r\nhis own about the tillage of which he may occupy himself, and not\r\nserving any other, shall be bound to serve the employer who shall\r\nrequire him to do so, and shall take only the wages which were\r\naccustomed to be taken in the neighborhood where he is bound to serve\"\r\ntwo years before the plague began. A refusal to obey was punished by\r\nimprisonment. Here was an attempt to fix the rate of wages by statute,\r\nand to fix them very much lower than a fair market rate; and, further,\r\nto force the unemployed laborer to serve any man who first demanded\r\nit. The statute failed in its object, naturally, and so sterner\r\nmeasures were adopted. \"Not only was the price of labor fixed by\r\nParliament in the next statute of 1351, but the labor class was once\r\nmore tied to the soil.\" It was made the servant not of one master but\r\nof a class--the employers. \"The laborer was forbidden to quit the\r\nparish where he lived in search of better-paid employment; if he\r\ndisobeyed, he became a 'fugitive,' and subject to imprisonment at the\r\nhands of the justices of the peace.\" Provisions had risen so that a\r\nday's work at the legal wages would not purchase enough for a man's\r\nsupport, and therefore no such law could be enforced literally. Still,\r\nthe landowners persisted in trying, and at last the runaway laborer,\r\nthe man looking for better wages, was branded on the forehead with a\r\nhot iron, while the harboring of serfs in towns was rigorously put\r\ndown. As the landowners wanted all the labor they could get, the\r\ncommutation of labor service for money payments ceased, and every\r\neffort was made and every quibble taken advantage of to annul\r\nmanumissions previously made. In the towns, under the pressure of the\r\ncraftsmen, the system of forced labor was applied with even more\r\nrigor than in the country, and strikes and combinations became\r\nfrequent.\r\n\r\nThat is the state of things in free England at a time when labor was\r\nnot strong enough to protect itself--called upon by the law of the\r\nland to work for less than living wages or be branded as cattle! The\r\nirrepressible conflict between capital and labor began with the very\r\nbeginning of the existence of the labor class.\r\n\r\nIn such a condition of things as here indicated, is it any wonder that\r\nthere were labor disturbances in those days--that there was a peasant\r\nrevolt? Already the doctrine of the equality of man and social\r\ninequality was being preached to the lower classes. In 1360 John\r\nBall--\"a mad priest in Kent,\" as Froissart calls him--preached such a\r\ncommunistic sermon as this to the sturdy yeomen of that day: \"Good\r\npeople, things will never go well in England so long as goods be not\r\nin common, and so long as there be villeins and gentlemen. By what\r\nright are they whom we call lords greater folk than we? On what\r\ngrounds have they deserved it? Why do they hold us in serfage? If we\r\nall came of the same father and mother, of Adam and Eve, how can they\r\nsay or prove that they are better than we, if it be not that they make\r\nus gain for them by our toil what they spend in their pride? They are\r\nclothed in velvet, and warm in their furs and their ermines, while we\r\nare covered with rags. They have wine and spices and fair bread; and\r\nwe oatcake and straw, and water to drink. They have leisure and fine\r\nhouses; we have pain and labor, the rain and wind in the fields. And\r\nyet it is of us and of our toil that these men hold their state.\" That\r\nis the same cry against the inequality of property and social\r\ncondition which we hear to-day. And we may thank him, and men like him\r\nand with his inspiration, that the conditions of five hundred years\r\nago have changed, and that the dawn of a better and higher humanity\r\nhas broken upon us. Filled with socialism and communism as the words\r\nare, they still have a truth which appeals to every sympathetic and\r\nthoughtful man.\r\n\r\nAnd it was in those early days that the old rhyme was heard all over\r\nthe land:\r\n\r\n      \"When Adam delved and Eve span.\r\n      Who was then the gentleman?\"\r\n\r\nThe sermon was preached against the tyranny of property, the rhyme was\r\nfull of the democracy of the coming years.\r\n\r\nI do not imagine that the instigators of such laws as the Statute of\r\nLaborers were hard men as men go. They could see only their side of\r\nthe case. The laborer had become a necessity for them, and they rather\r\nbelieved that the Almighty had put him on earth for their advantage. I\r\nam afraid that something of that spirit still is left among us. The\r\nfeeling still exists that the employer and capitalist can take care\r\nof and provide for the employees better than they can themselves; that\r\nthey should be very thankful when out of his abundance the employer\r\nbuilds them a library or permits them to live in some finely ordered\r\nvillage as he directs. But somehow the feeling is growing now that if\r\nthe wage-earner had a larger and fairer share in the profits he could\r\ntake care of himself better in the end and grow faster, because he\r\nwould be more his own master; and that the good things now and then\r\ngiven him with more or less ostentation as gifts are bought with the\r\nmoney he really ought to have and in the future hopes to have himself.\r\n\r\nWell, the result of such laws and the general social discontent and\r\nthe levy of new taxes upon even the lower classes brought about the\r\nPeasant Revolt in 1381. Of course, the power of the upper classes,\r\naided by the courage of Richard II, then only a boy, put down the\r\nrevolt, but not until the king had promised amnesty and emancipation\r\nto the serfs. Death on the scaffold and in the field soon showed the\r\nparticipants how little such promises were worth. The serfs were\r\nsubdued, but strife between the laborers and employers was not ended.\r\nThe legislation still reflects the terror and greed of the landowners,\r\nfor, in spite of all, labor was in demand and had the market at its\r\nfeet. Legislation forbade \"the child of any tiller of the soil to be\r\napprenticed in a town,\" and the landowners \"prayed Richard to ordain\r\n'that no bondman or bondwoman shall place their children at school, as\r\nhas been done, so as to advance their children in the world by their\r\ngoing into the church.'\" But villeinage continued to disappear, and\r\nwithin the next hundred and fifty years it had become \"an antiquated\r\nthing.\" The failure of the landowners to again fasten labor to the\r\nsoil and to fix low wages drove their energies in a new direction.\r\n\"Sheep farming required fewer hands than tillage, and the scarcity and\r\nhigh price of labor tended to throw more and more land into sheep\r\nfarms.\" As personal service died away it became the interest of the\r\nlord to unite the small holdings on his estate into larger ones. The\r\nevictions consequent upon this course threw many laborers upon the\r\nmarket, and the sheep farms diminished the number required, while the\r\nsmaller amount of holdings devoted to agriculture increased the price\r\nof food. And so it is not surprising that within the course of a\r\ncomparatively few years, instead of a scarcity there was a glut of\r\nlabor; that pauperism increased, and social discontent continued; that\r\nvagabondage with its dangers to society at large became a difficult\r\nproblem. Indeed, the poor have always been with us, but those of us\r\nwho find so much to depress us in these modern days can get new\r\ncourage by looking back to those old days and can see the real\r\nprogress which has been made. The whole lower class in England down to\r\nthe time of Elizabeth stood looking into the face of want. Henry VIII\r\nconfiscated the monasteries, but put nothing in their place, and in a\r\nmeasure by so doing deprived the poor of some relief from the wealth\r\nof the church. But Elizabeth inaugurated a system of poor-laws which,\r\nalthough crude and somewhat hard, still served to ward off some of the\r\nsocial danger. The course of events, however, and the rise of new\r\nindustries did more to make life for the laborer, the landless man,\r\nless bitter. With the discovery of America and the opening of\r\nfisheries in these western waters, and the adventurous and\r\nbuccaneering voyages of Drake and his compeers, came the gradual\r\ndevelopment of manufacture, and a \"more careful and constant\r\ncultivation of the land.\" All these were new and larger avenues for\r\nthe employment of labor. By this time the laborer had grown entirely\r\naway from serfage, had been freed from the terrible grasp of a\r\nhopeless future, and the possibility of a degree of comfort and\r\nindependence had come into existence. We need not linger longer over\r\nhis early days. The laborer still had his peculiar trials and\r\nhardships, but he had a future. From a subject class, the terror as\r\nwell as necessity of its employers, he has grown to be their equal\r\nbefore the law, and this by his own efforts, aided, of course, by the\r\nadvance of society and the broader humanity of mankind.\r\n\r\nThe increase of manufacture brought with it a new danger to the\r\nworking class as we reach our times, and brought about a state of\r\nthings which gave rise to trades unions. Manufacture naturally in the\r\nbeginning was carried on in a small way, but in modern times,\r\nespecially as we get into this century, the small concerns grew into\r\nlarge ones. Instead of one man or partnership with a comparatively\r\nsmall amount of capital, the corporation or joint-stock company with\r\nits large aggregation of capital carries on the business of\r\nmanufacture and trade. This aggregation of capital has made an entire\r\nchange in the relation between employer and employee. The corporation\r\ncame in the line of progress. Consolidation of capital has come to\r\nstay, and properly so, but it brought with it dangers, just as every\r\nstep in advance has done. It was to meet the new dangers to the\r\nwage-earners that trades unions came into being, for trades unions and\r\nlabor unions are really only organizations of labor as corporations\r\nare aggregations of capital.\r\n\r\nWhen industrial establishments were small, the owner, whether in trade\r\nor manufacture, had practically absolute direction of his business. In\r\nthe industrial world what corresponds to an unlimited monarchy in the\r\npolitical world has been the system. As establishments grew larger,\r\nthe autocratic power of the owner passed to the manager acting for the\r\nowners. As one writer puts it: \"Huge industrial establishments are\r\nunder the unrestrained control of a single man. At his will they are\r\nset in motion; at his will they stand still; at his will capital and\r\nlabor unite and are fruitful; at his will they are parted and remain\r\nbarren. Men come and go at his bidding. He knows no superior and\r\nrecognizes no limitations. He calls an attempt at control 'dictation'\r\nand resents it with anger.\" That is the extreme case, and is\r\nindustrial despotism. While the results doubtless are good in many\r\ncases, and the laborer receives fair and decent treatment in most\r\ncases, that is owing to the temperament or prudence and good judgment\r\nof the master and not to the system. Such a condition of things is\r\nbecoming more and more modified. We have reached in many cases a\r\ncondition which may be said to correspond to a monarchy with\r\nconstitutional limitations--the master is restrained in the exercise\r\nof his power by public opinion, the strength of the workingmen, and in\r\nsome cases by legal limitations. The organization of boards of\r\narbitration, and the recognition of the right of the employee to a\r\nshare in the profits, are daily extending. The tendency toward giving\r\nthe wage-earners a share in the business, some modified form of\r\nco-operation, is daily extending. The trend is toward what may be\r\ncalled industrial democracy, just as in the political world real\r\ndemocracy is fast becoming the universal principle, whatever the style\r\nof the government may be.\r\n\r\nThis advance in the industrial world has come about through the\r\nagitation and power of labor organizations, of which, as they exist\r\nnow, trades unions were the early manifestation. The employer, as a\r\nrule, looked after his own interests mainly, and the employee alone by\r\nhimself had to take what he could get and do as he was told. Just as\r\nthe people, after they sunk into subjection in the earlier days, had\r\nlittle political power as against the nobility until they were strong\r\nenough to take it, so the laborer still would be of little account\r\nexcept as a more or less intelligent machine unless he had proved\r\nhimself a man, with a man's aspirations and a man's energy.\r\n\r\nLabor organizations or trades unions came into existence in England.\r\nThe democratic spirit, the spirit of liberty, the Saxon spirit of\r\nindependence, which wrested from kings and the nobility all the rights\r\nwhich the common people enjoy, has been doing in the industrial world\r\nonly what it did in the political world years before.\r\n\r\nWe may say that trades unions find their prototype in the _frith\r\nguilds_ or _peace guilds_ of the Anglo-Saxon. A few words in general\r\nabout them and their successors and the spirit pervading them, the\r\ncauses of their existence and decay, will have a bearing on labor\r\norganizations, which are like them in \"being founded on similar mental\r\nfaculties and desires and as contemplating similar purposes.\"\r\n\r\nThese _frith guilds_ seem to have been associations of neighbors for\r\nmutual help and protection. They replaced the older brotherhood of\r\nkinsfolk, which had existed among the German races, \"by a voluntary\r\nassociation of neighbors for the same purposes of order and\r\nself-defense.\" An isolated existence for a man, even a freeman, was\r\none of danger, especially when the feudal temper of the nobles\r\nincreased and the Danish incursions broke over England. The ties of\r\nkindred had become weakened, and the frith guild took the place of the\r\nfamily. A mutual oath bound the members together, and the monthly\r\nguild feast became the substitute for the old gathering round the\r\nfamily hearth. A member could call upon the guild in case of violence\r\nor wrong; when charged with crime, the guild answered for him, and\r\nwhen guilty, punished him; when poor, it supported him; and when dead,\r\nburied him. When these guilds were located in towns rather than in the\r\ncountry, they inevitably tended in time to combine, and eventually the\r\ntown passed from a collection of guilds into one large guild, and we\r\nhave the _town guild_. The word \"town\" is used in contradistinction\r\nfrom the word \"country,\" just as we say \"town and country,\" \"going to\r\ntown,\" and so on. The spirit of independence and freedom, kept alive\r\nin our town meetings here, and in our local self-government, has come\r\ndown to us through those old town guilds and the boroughs of England.\r\nIt is to the towns of England and not to the country that we owe much\r\nof our liberty to-day.\r\n\r\nSo these guilds in towns, by joining together and making a town guild,\r\nbecame quite strong communities. They made demands upon the crown\r\nitself, and took upon themselves the government of the towns where\r\nthey were located. Their members were the landowners of the town, and\r\nthe other people who came there to settle, no matter how numerous, had\r\nno part in the government. From being democratic in the beginning, as\r\nthe frith guilds were, the towns became oligarchies.\r\n\r\nIn the course of time the differences between town and country became\r\nmore marked. The town guilds began to have less and less to do with\r\nagriculture, although at first they were interested in it. The wealth\r\nin the town is turned to trade and manufacture, such as there was in\r\nthose days. So, by the time of the Norman conquest, in 1066, we hear\r\nlittle of town guilds, but in almost every case _merchant guilds_. The\r\n_town guild_ has become a _merchant guild_, although composed of the\r\nsame constituency. The commercial spirit has become the ruling spirit\r\nof the town.\r\n\r\nAs time went on and life and property became safer and trade\r\nincreased, the consequent accumulation of wealth in towns produced\r\nimportant results in the character of these municipal institutions.\r\n\"In becoming a merchant guild the body of citizens who formed\" the\r\ngovernment of \"the town enlarged their powers of civic legislation by\r\napplying them to the control of their internal trade.\" No longer\r\nconfining themselves to providing for public order or protection from\r\nunjust oppression or dangers from without, they began to legislate for\r\ntheir own immediate advancement and for their own pockets. \"It became\r\ntheir especial business to obtain from the crown or from their lords\r\nwider commercial privileges, rights of coinage, grants of fairs, and\r\nexemptions from tolls; while within the town itself they framed\r\nregulations as to the sale and quality of goods, the control of\r\nmarkets, and the recovery of debts.\" And further, the members of the\r\nguild withdrew from the humbler trades to confine themselves to the\r\nlarger business of commerce or trades requiring large capital, leaving\r\nthe trades and traffic given up to their poorer neighbors. This ruling\r\nclass comprised only a part of the inhabitants, only the members of\r\nthe merchant guild. The great mass of the people, the artisans and the\r\npoor, the men without land, the serfs escaped from the country and\r\ngaining their freedom in the town, all had no voice in the government\r\nwhatever. They lived and worked and earned their daily bread\r\npractically by permission or at least under the direct control of the\r\nmerchant guild. From a simple association, the guilds in towns had\r\nbecome the governing body, and a government in the hands of a few at\r\nthat. From the need of protection on account of individual weakness,\r\nthe members of the guilds had grown to be in need of repression; and\r\nwith the demand for repression came the instrument of repression--the\r\n_craft guild_. Against the autocratic power of the merchant guild\r\narose the craft guilds, or associations of workers in the various\r\ntrades, those trades abandoned by the merchants, and these guilds\r\n\"soon rose into dangerous rivalry with the original merchant guild of\r\nthe town.\"\r\n\r\nThese craft guilds in the old English towns, in order to attain their\r\nobjects, considered it necessary to compel the whole body of craftsmen\r\nbelonging to the trade to join the guild of that craft or trade; and\r\nfurther, that the guild should have legal control over the trade\r\nitself--who should be admitted to it, and so forth. \"A royal charter\r\nwas indispensable for these purposes, and over the grant of these\r\ncharters took place the first struggle with the merchant guild, which\r\nhad till then solely exercised jurisdiction over trade within the\r\nborough.\" The struggle was a fierce one and long continued, but the\r\nspread of the craft guilds went steadily on, and the control of trade\r\npassed into their hands. Then the next step--a share in the government\r\nof the borough itself--was taken, and the government of the towns\r\npassed from an oligarchy into the hands of the middle classes.\r\n\r\nThe craft guild came into being just as its predecessor had, from the\r\nnecessity of association for protection, and like it was democratic at\r\nfirst; and, again like it, became in time an oligarchy as narrow as\r\nthat which it had deposed. The craft guild arose because the artisans\r\nand tradesmen had grown to a position where they could recognize the\r\ninjustice and oppression of the merchant guild, and were strong enough\r\nand persistent enough to assert themselves, and as long as the craft\r\nguilds were democratic in spirit and were true to the needs for which\r\nthey were organized they flourished. But with age and success came\r\nnarrowness and bigotry and opposition to progress. They became\r\nmonopolies of employment and societies of greedy capitalists, and in\r\nEngland withered away before the growth of the modern vast industrial\r\nestablishment.\r\n\r\nI have ventured to give this general sketch of these guilds because\r\nthe same spirit and necessities which inspired them brought the trades\r\nunion into being. The trades union or labor organization was created\r\nto protect the laborer and gain for him a better position in life, to\r\nraise his standard of living. It is like the old guilds in being\r\nsubject to the same dangers as they were, and when it proves false to\r\nits true objects it will pass away as did the old guilds. It will last\r\nonly so long as there is a necessity for its existence, as long as it\r\ndoes the work it is born to do. And when it has come to deny freedom,\r\nto refuse another's rights, and to repress industry, the seeds of\r\ndissolution are already sown.\r\n\r\nTrades unions or labor unions arose from the necessity of organization\r\namong the laborers or wage-earners if they were to hold their own\r\nagainst the aggregation of capital. The craft guild arose at a time\r\nwhen trading and manufacturing concerns were small, when the interest\r\nof both master and workman in a business were alike joined in\r\nopposition to the exactions of a superior class--the merchant guild;\r\nwhile the trades union came upon the field to protect the laborer\r\nagainst his employer. Whatever other objects and aims it may have had\r\ndo not enter into my purposes in this paper. The personal relation\r\nwhich had existed between the master and servant, the employer and his\r\nfew employees, the manufacturer and his half dozen workmen or\r\napprentices, no longer existed when the workers became scores and\r\nhundreds, and the owner of the business was replaced by the manager or\r\nsuperintendent. That personal relation was in some measure a\r\nprotection for both, but when that disappeared the temptation to\r\ngratify owners and stockholders with big dividends became too strong\r\nto be overcome. Against organized capital there was absolute need of\r\norganized labor, and trades unions and labor unions and such\r\norganizations came into existence.\r\n\r\nThere was no possibility of their existence until the laborer had\r\nbecome intellectually and socially capable of organization, and until\r\nthe divine spirit of discontent drove him to association with his\r\nbrother worker. During all the years from the time of his serfdom up\r\nto the time these organizations began he had been slowly growing in\r\ndevelopment and gaining something in political position, but it was\r\nnot until political power came nearer and nearer to him that he gained\r\nthe strength to raise his standard of living, to make a stand for\r\nhimself. He knew the struggle would be a hard one, for everything he\r\ngained seemed to be something taken away from those who held\r\nthemselves above him and better than he.\r\n\r\nAs a rule, we are very well content to let things alone if we\r\nourselves are fairly comfortable, and especially are we blind to\r\nanother's ills if the remedy for them is found in a renunciation of\r\npart of that which we have always considered our own. There is nothing\r\nparticularly new in this. We easily can imagine some worthy burgher in\r\nthe olden time expostulating at the demand of the craft guild even to\r\nbe allowed to exist, and I do not imagine his language varied much in\r\nspirit from the indignant disgust shown by some large employer of\r\nlabor to-day when he talks of labor unions. Doubtless these unions\r\nto-day seem to him to have the same dangerous tendencies which the\r\ncraft guilds were talked of as having eight hundred years ago.\r\n\r\nIf there were no wrongs to right, if selfishness did not exist, if\r\nthere were a real belief in the brotherhood of man, and life were in\r\naccordance with that belief, such organizations might not be\r\nnecessary, or if they existed have other aims; but until all men have\r\nan equal chance for self-development, and a chance for something more\r\nthan a mere existence, labor unions or something to take their place\r\nmust exist.\r\n\r\nAnd so we stand to-day with labor unions and the labor problem, so\r\ncalled, with us. The laboring class is discontented. Men claim as\r\nrights what their fathers would have been glad to get as favors. There\r\nare violence and bad blood and waste, and so there have been from the\r\nbeginning. But there have been also injustice and oppression and greed\r\nfrom the beginning. While we may condemn strongly much of the violence\r\nand wrongdoing of labor organizations, we can find many extenuating\r\ncircumstances. The same spirit of independence, the same desire for\r\nequal justice which animated the old guilds of England, and which have\r\nmade the Englishman and those who have sprung from him the freest as\r\nwell as most law-abiding people on the earth, are found within the\r\norganizations of labor. We in this country hardly can find only danger\r\nin the spirit which impels the workingman to resist every encroachment\r\nupon his rights, to strive for that better future to which he believes\r\nhe is entitled. There were many things done in the youth of our\r\nhistory which in our manhood we regret, and I hardly think, as a\r\nnation, our own robe is so unspotted that we must draw it round us\r\nlest it be soiled by the violence of a perhaps uneducated and\r\ninadvisable but still earnest effort after higher and better\r\nconditions of life. Let us read and ponder over our histories anew,\r\nand with humble hearts try to find a better way both for the laborer\r\nand ourselves.\r\n\r\nI have said that it was through his organization that the laborer has\r\nmade the industrial and social advance he certainly has made in the\r\nlast century. The trades unions, like the guilds before them, had to\r\nstruggle for a legal existence, and their early days were full of\r\nviolence. Dr. Brentano, in his work on Trades Unions, says: \"They have\r\nfought contests quite as fierce as those of the old craftsmen against\r\nthe patricians, if not fiercer. The history of their sufferings since\r\nthe end of the eighteenth century, and of the privations endured for\r\ntheir independence, is a real record of heroism.\" May not we hope with\r\nhim that now they may cease using the arms of violence which belong to\r\nformer times and use the legal means which belong to our days?\r\n\r\nWe can not approve of their violence, but let us not be unduly alarmed\r\nby it. If society becomes so ossified in its usages and habits and\r\nthinking that a newer and better thought can not get in, a nobler way\r\nof living for all be entered upon, it sometimes seems as if in the\r\nvery nature of things violence must come to rend away the\r\nobstructions. I believe that labor organizations are as much the\r\ninstruments of progress as the town guilds and craft guilds of old.\r\nThey will do their work, and the world will be the better for it. They\r\ntend to make society more democratic industrially as well as\r\npolitically, as their predecessors did, and therefore better. For what\r\nis democracy but a practical recognition of the brotherhood of man? If\r\nChristianity amounts to anything, what higher aim should we have than\r\nthat?\r\n\r\nMany students of the problems involved state that in the long run\r\nlabor still does not receive its full share of the profits; that in\r\norder to keep up the standard of living which the wage-earner already\r\nhas reached he must have a larger reserve fund. In other words, he\r\nmust be able to save more. To do that and still live as he claims he\r\nought, his share in the profits, his wages, must be larger than now.\r\nWe can not claim that the standard is too high because admittedly it\r\nis higher than ever before. Hon. Carroll D. Wright, in a recent\r\naddress, says: \"Under the iron law of wages as announced by Ricardo,\r\nit [the labor question] is a struggle simply to secure barely enough\r\nof food and raiment and shelter to preserve the working physical\r\nmachine, the rule being that wages ought not to be paid over the bare\r\nnecessities. To-day the standard of living of the ordinary wage\r\nreceiver involves margins above the iron law of from ten to fifteen\r\nper cent, out of which margin is to be found what are now called\r\nspiritual necessities, means of leisure, reading, music, recreation,\r\netc., so that the demand of the worker in all civilized countries is\r\nfor the expansion of this margin. He feels entitled to this because\r\nsociety has insisted upon educating him, giving him a taste for higher\r\nthings, making him a social and political factor; in fact, fitting\r\nhim for membership in a democratic community.\"\r\n\r\nLabor organizations, in spite of much extravagant language and many\r\nill-advised acts, certainly aim at a better condition for the\r\nwage-earner. We fail to see the intelligence underlying industrial\r\ncontroversies because progress has been so rapid. Some of the methods\r\nof labor organizations are violent and the weapons used are in a great\r\nmeasure strikes and boycotts. That is industrial warfare and is as\r\ncostly and wasteful and cruel in many ways as any warfare is, but very\r\noften these organizations seem to have no other method of making their\r\npower felt; no other way of bringing about a needed reform. And we can\r\nnot say that all strikes have been or are necessarily wrong, except in\r\nthe same way that all warfare is an evil. The very readiness to strike\r\nwill effect a reform which a known weakness or lack of courage on the\r\npart of the organization would have prevented. Such an authority as\r\nJohn Stuart Mill says that \"strikes, therefore, and the trade\r\nsocieties which render strikes possible, are for these various reasons\r\nnot a mischievous, but, on the contrary, a valuable part of the\r\nexisting machinery of society.\" Whether in a particular case a strike\r\nor boycott is right or wrong depends upon the facts of that case, and\r\nwhether we have reached a point where strikes are no longer right, no\r\nmatter what may have been the case in the past, is another question.\r\nLet us hope we are nearer that time, at any rate. It will depend upon\r\nthe attitude of employers as well as employees.\r\n\r\nOut of strikes themselves comes a remedy. Daniel J. Ryan, in his\r\narticle on Arbitration, records that \"for sixteen years the disputes\r\nof labor and capital in the rolling mills of England have been settled\r\nby arbitration, and it has been an era remarkably free from strikes.\r\nThe Board of Arbitration for the north of England iron business was,\r\nas all efforts of this kind usually are, the outgrowth of a strike.\"\r\nNow, in this part of England before the formation of this board,\r\nstrikes were chronic. The works in that section recently had 1,913\r\npuddling furnaces--more than in all Pennsylvania, and half as many as\r\nin the entire United States.\r\n\r\nThe limits of this article will not allow a discussion of voluntary or\r\ninvoluntary arbitration, but let me say that in the above case we see\r\nthat a simple arrangement between the parties changed all the strife\r\nto peace. Will society long tolerate a continuance of industrial\r\nwarfare when it has in its own hands a preventive? For its own\r\nprotection will it not tell employer and laborer, \"You must settle\r\nyour differences quietly by mutual agreement, or, if you can not, I\r\nwill settle them for you\"? It says this now to the individual. Men and\r\nwomen are not allowed in these days to settle their rights and wrongs\r\nby brute force. That method passed away long years ago in civilized\r\ncommunities. And society must continue to suffer from the violence and\r\nwaste of strikes until it teaches employers and workingmen and itself\r\na higher and better way.\r\n\r\nMay not it be possible that the outcome will be that associations of\r\nwage-earners are to be treated as the equals of the employer? Will not\r\nthe democratic spirit of the age to come so permeate the industrial as\r\nwell as the political world that the laborer and the employer will\r\neach have a share in the business they together carry on?\r\n\r\nI have tried to make a very broad sketch of the change which has taken\r\nplace in the condition of the laborer, with a consideration of some of\r\nthe means by which that has come about. No longer is he a serf--no\r\nlonger even the servant of a ruling class. He at length has risen to a\r\nshare in the government of his town and country. No longer are laws\r\npassed against him specially, but in his favor. The laborer has become\r\nfree--free to follow along the path of his predecessors, to gain full\r\njustice, but not to oppress others. Before the law at least he is the\r\nequal of his employer. I have implied at least that he has but\r\nfollowed the spirit which led his older brother of the middle class up\r\nfrom practical subjection to power. The craft guilds of the one, the\r\nlabor unions of the other, are in the same line as the old town\r\nguilds. They all are manifestations of that democratic independence\r\nwhich seems necessary for political freedom. They all imply the\r\ncapacity for organization as they all have shown its power. Let us\r\nbelieve that, like the old guilds, these labor organizations are\r\nhelpful parts of the machinery of human progress. They force upon us\r\nthe fact that there have been and are injustices which must be\r\nrighted. We are beginning to learn that we can not depend upon one\r\nside alone for our political economy or our facts; that we need an\r\norganization strong enough to compel respect in order to protect those\r\nwho without it would be, as they have been, helpless.\r\n\r\nAll the smoke and clash of industrial warfare seem terrifying; the\r\ninnocent victims shock our sense of justice, but it is leading to the\r\nperfect peace. The true democracy--the brotherhood of man--is forcing\r\nitself upon mankind. If we in our prejudice, our selfishness, our\r\nignorance, defy the signs of its coming, try to prevent its growth, or\r\nfind only license in liberty, we shall continue to suffer all the ills\r\nwhich an obstruction of progress or a violation of its laws always\r\nbrings with it. Is it not true that never in the history of the world\r\nhas there been an agrarian rising, a peasant revolt, a labor war, that\r\nback of it we do not find as a main cause the injustice, the\r\noppression, the selfishness of a more powerful class? And will there\r\nbe perfect peace, perfect prosperity, until the divine harmony--the\r\nreal brotherhood of man--is the rule of life? Wrong always breeds\r\nviolence. But out of that violence, when the wrong is made right,\r\ncomes peace. Massachusetts in her motto declares that \"by the sword\r\nshe seeks peace,\" and, to use Richard T. Ely's words, \"the Prince of\r\nPeace proclaimed, 'Think not that I am come to send peace on earth; I\r\ncame not to send peace, but a sword'; and yet truly was he called the\r\nPrince of Peace.\" Often is war the price of peace. And no one, no\r\nclass of men, deserve their freedom unless, when all other means fail,\r\nthey have the courage and energy to pay the price.\r\n\r\nTherefore, we will not be alarmed at struggles which in the end will\r\nbring about a better condition of life for all. Rather let us try to\r\nend those struggles by pushing bravely on toward the end mankind is\r\nstriving for. We, with such a past as ours, must not be false to the\r\nideal which is our birthright; we should not be incapable of finding\r\nthe true way. If we will forget our merely partisan strife, our petty\r\njealousies, our class distinctions, and have only one aim, justice for\r\nall, an equal chance for self-development for all, whether he be born\r\nrich or poor, the ruling spirit of the next century will keep America\r\nstill true to her high calling, and mankind still will find in her the\r\ninspiration to raise the disheartened and lowly of other lands. The\r\ntruest patriotism is broad enough to help the unfortunate everywhere,\r\nand with courage, intelligence, and a faith in true democracy we shall\r\nnot fail.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BERING SEA CONTROVERSY ONCE MORE.\r\n\r\nBY PROF. T. C. MENDENHALL.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Clark's interesting and, on the whole, fair review of my article\r\non Expert Testimony in the Bering Sea Controversy, printed in this\r\njournal in 1897, might be allowed to stand, without comment, as the\r\nbest possible vindication of the work of the Bering Sea Commission of\r\n1891-'92, and as strong corroborative evidence of the soundness of the\r\nposition taken in the article referred to. One or two quotations which\r\nhe makes, however, are placed in such relation to other parts of the\r\npaper as to imply meanings which a reading of the article as a whole\r\nwill show were never intended. This is notably true of the description\r\nof the frame of mind in which a scientific man should approach or\r\nconduct any investigation, which Mr. Clark quotes, and the further\r\nstatement that, unfortunately, he often fails to come up to the\r\nstandard set, and especially when his own interests are involved.\r\n\r\nIt might easily be inferred that these remarks were meant to have\r\nspecial application to the members of one or both Bering Sea\r\ncommissions, while as a matter of fact they were a part of the general\r\nintroduction, occurring some time before any reference is made to the\r\ncommissions. I should greatly regret having any one understand that\r\nthere was the slightest intimation of the existence of a \"handsome\r\nretainer,\" or anything of the sort, in connection with any or all of\r\nthe Bering Sea investigations.\r\n\r\nAs far as the American representatives on the first commission are\r\nconcerned, it is no harm to say that the pecuniary residual was\r\nunfortunately affected by the wrong sign, and this was doubtless the\r\ncase as well with Dr. Jordan and his colleagues.\r\n\r\nAs to the truth of the statement regarding the \"scientific expert,\" no\r\nevidence need be offered here, for it is furnished by every court in\r\nthe land, and not a day passes that does not witness a struggle\r\nbetween \"experts\" who have nearly always started from the same\r\npremises, but whose conclusions are diametrically opposed to each\r\nother. What I do want to say is that this is quite consistent with the\r\nperfect honesty and good intent of the experts themselves. It is the\r\nresult of the limitations to which the operations of the human\r\nintellect are still subjected, and it is a fact always to be reckoned\r\nwith in matters of this kind. There should be no skepticism as to the\r\nhonesty and frankness of Sir George Baden-Powell and Dr. George M.\r\nDawson in assuming an attitude so opposed to that of the American\r\ncommissioners in 1892.\r\n\r\nMr. Clark regards my article of 1897 as a \"prediction of failure for\r\nthe new commission,\" an assumption quite unjustified and unsustained\r\nby the article itself, in which the fullest recognition is shown of\r\nthe great value of the work of Dr. Jordan and his colleagues. Indeed,\r\nthe article was purposely prepared and published before the meeting of\r\nthe second commission, that it might not seem to be in any way a\r\ncriticism upon its work. Now that both commissions have made public\r\ntheir findings, the whole matter is easily accessible, but Mr. Clark\r\nis hardly just to the first commissioners on either side, by the\r\nslight reference he makes to their separate reports to their\r\nrespective governments. A more careful study of both might have led to\r\nsome modification of his views, even concerning the partition of\r\nauthorship which he has ventured to make. It is no mean compliment,\r\nhowever, to find him admitting, in regard to the report of the\r\nAmerican commissioners, that \"not a single statement of fact in it has\r\nproved fallacious, and the more exhaustive investigations of 1896 and\r\n1897 corroborate its conclusions in every particular.\" And this\r\nadmission lies adjacent to his assertion that \"the investigations\r\nconducted by the two commissions [of 1891] were, from a scientific\r\npoint of view, of the nature of a farce.\" The fact is, Mr. Clark seems\r\nto have strangely misunderstood the character of the investigations\r\nwhich were contemplated and desired. The natural history of the fur\r\nseal was not the question submitted to the joint commission, except\r\nin so far as it specially affected seal life in Bering Sea and the\r\nmeasures necessary for its proper protection and preservation.\r\n\r\n\"Facts, causes, and remedies\" were the subjects to be considered.\r\nThere is an old saying that the flavor of the pudding may often be\r\nrevealed by chewing the string, and no long and exhaustive\r\ninvestigation was necessary to enable the American commissioners to\r\narrive at what Mr. Clark admits to be the \"facts, causes, and\r\nremedies\" for the Bering Sea problem. Not many weeks were occupied in\r\nthe field, it is true, for the commission was delayed in its\r\nappointment and notification, and the season was nearly over when it\r\nreached the islands. But, as Mr. Clark justly remarks, one member of\r\nthe commission, Dr. Merriam, was already exceptionally well informed\r\nconcerning the habits of the fur seal, and some things may be so in\r\nevidence that even a physicist can see them.\r\n\r\nIt is true that the _joint_ report of the commission of 1891-'92 was\r\nmeager, and the explanation lies close at hand in the unwillingness of\r\nthe American commissioners to swerve from what they were convinced was\r\nabsolutely true. Mr. Clark will look in vain for the \"handwriting of\r\ndiplomacy mingled with that of science,\" for the appearance of which\r\nin the report of the commission of 1897 he offers apologies, except,\r\nindeed, it be the diplomacy of going straight at the facts without\r\nconcealment or evasion, on which Americans have sometimes prided\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\nThe joint report was limited to that, and only that, on which the\r\ncommissioners were actually agreed, and the American commissioners\r\nhave explained in their separate report that had they been willing to\r\nconcede certain points the joint report would have been greatly\r\naugmented in volume. Mr. Clark has reviewed the conclusions of the\r\ncommission of 1897, which he justly considers a most important and\r\nvaluable document. It has not escaped his attention that in a number\r\nof the paragraphs of this report the American commissioners have\r\ncommitted themselves to the approval of several doubtful statements,\r\nsuch as that \"the pelagic industry is conducted in an orderly manner,\r\nand in a spirit of acquiescence in the limitations imposed by law\";\r\nthat a certain number of females may be killed without involving the\r\nactual diminution of the herd; the \"tendency toward equilibrium\r\ntheory\"; that the herd is still far from a stage that threatens\r\nextermination, and others. These statements he excuses as \"balm for\r\nthe wounded feelings of the pelagic sealer\"; \"a concession to\r\ndiplomacy\"; \"a diplomatic concession to take the sting out of the real\r\nadmission\"; \"another concession to diplomacy,\" etc. I do not wish to\r\nbe understood as questioning the necessity or wisdom of inserting\r\nthese paragraphs in the joint report, but is it not a little strange\r\nthat with them in, and apologizing for them as he does, Mr. Clark\r\nshould have selected this as a model of what the report of a\r\nscientific commission ought to be and sufficient of itself to forever\r\nfix the value of the scientific expert in the settlement of government\r\ndisputes? As I have already intimated, no one appreciates more highly\r\nthan I the great work done by Dr. Jordan and his associates in the\r\nstudy of the natural history of the seal. May not the work of the two\r\ncommissions, as _bearing on the problem of the fur-seal industry_, be\r\nsummed up about as follows?--The report of the American members of the\r\nfirst commission related facts, declared causes, and proposed\r\nremedies. The American case at the Paris arbitration rested on these.\r\nAs almost universally happens, arbitration resulted in compromise,\r\nunsatisfactory to both parties, and, as has since turned out,\r\ndecidedly unfavorable to one. The commission of 1897 has made a joint\r\nreport of considerable length and much importance, in which the\r\n\"facts, causes, and remedies\" of the report of 1892 are in a sense\r\nconfirmed, but with a number of concessions that do not strengthen the\r\nAmerican contention regarding pelagic sealing, the justice of which\r\nseems to be admitted by Mr. Clark. But the practical question is, What\r\nhas been the effect of either or both of these commissions upon the\r\nfur-seal industry? It would be unkind to press this question upon one\r\nwho characterizes the work of the first commission as above quoted,\r\nand who speaks of the second as having, after being in joint session\r\none week, \"concluded its labors, reaching a full and satisfactory\r\nagreement.\" If he really wishes to know what progress is being made\r\nunder such an agreeable state of affairs, let him inquire of the\r\nInternational Joint Commission, which is endeavoring to arrange all\r\noutstanding differences between this country and Canada.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCAUSES AND PREVENTION OF INSANITY.\r\n\r\nBY SMITH BAKER, M. D.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is being found out that cases of insanity may of themselves fall\r\nnaturally into two classes: the first comprising those who get well,\r\nand the second those who do not. To the first class belong the\r\ndeliriums of fevers and other like diseases, and also certain acute\r\nmanias and melancholias and the so-called generalized insanities. In\r\nthe second class are included the insanities which last indefinitely,\r\nor, if seemingly cured, which, in the proportion of from twelve to\r\nfourteen per cent, come back again one or more times, and finally do\r\nnot recover. Says Regis: \"Out of all forms of mental alienation or\r\ninsanity only the generalized types--i. e., mania and melancholia--are\r\ncurable. The systematized insanities are essentially chronic and\r\nrecover only exceptionally\" (Practical Manual of Mental Medicine, page\r\n54). The latter are known by such specific names as paranoia, chronic\r\nmania, chronic melancholia, insanity of doubt, circular insanity,\r\nhereditary insanity, and the like. What makes such a division of\r\ninsanities into these two classes significant is not only that those\r\nof the first class get well and the others do not, but that, generally\r\nspeaking, these latter are so founded in the constitution of the\r\nindividual that they can not recover, let everything as yet possible\r\nbe done for them as it may. Probably there are exceptions to this;\r\nbut, if so, they are not very often met with. All these cases seem to\r\nbe doomed from the very first either to follow a slowly downward grade\r\nto the very end, or else to manifest a series of alternate better and\r\nworse stages, which, while giving rise to bright hopes of ultimate\r\nrecovery, nevertheless just as surely tend more or less rapidly\r\ndownward, in pretty strict accordance with the rule. In passing, it\r\nmay be noted that not only the tragedy of such alternations of\r\nemphatic despair and delusive hope constitutes not the least of the\r\nwretchedness involved in the history of these cases, but that it is by\r\nno means the easiest thing about them to manage; for, in the earlier\r\nstages, it is almost impossible to make associates or relatives\r\nunderstand the full meaning of the disease, or to take a correct view\r\nof its probable outcome. Even much later on they cling to the\r\npossibility of recovery, which is as delusive as it is painful, for\r\nthe disease goes on, nevertheless, with varying stride and\r\nmanifestation, until it finally becomes evident that hope is almost\r\nabsolutely without any real foundation.\r\n\r\nNow, when a case of persistent or recurrent but really irrecoverable\r\ninsanity is studied, with respect not only to the life of the\r\nindividual affected but to the lives of his ancestors, both remote and\r\nnear, and in sufficient detail, it is seen that the causes of the\r\npresent breakdown have been long and surely operative in those from\r\nwhom he has inherited certain unfavorable characteristics, and at\r\nwhose hands he has had his bringing up and education; and this even\r\nmuch more weightily than in himself or the life which he has lived. So\r\nfar as the patient's own responsible life is concerned, the common\r\ncauses, such as accident, infection, overwork, mental and moral\r\nstrain--in fact, all the usual forms of stress--have, of course, been\r\njust as variously to blame, and in just the same way as they have been\r\nin the production of insanities in other individuals who finally\r\nrecover. But even in respect to these latter, it probably may be most\r\nfrequently discovered that the harmful effects of certain so-called\r\nexciting causes have been experienced, not because of the common\r\nemergencies and exigencies of life so much as because of some peculiar\r\nbut unrevealed characteristics which have produced and maintained a\r\nsort of vicious maelstrom into which have been attracted all the\r\ndetrimental influences that have accidentally or intentionally come\r\nwithin reach. For instance, such persons are almost always\r\npredetermined to grow up into harmful bodily and mental habits. Says\r\nPeterson: \"Among all degenerates there is a taste or appetite for\r\ncertain foods or drugs which tend to favor their dissolution (alcohol,\r\nmorphine, cocaine, and the like)\" (State Hospitals Bulletin, vol. i,\r\np. 372). So also are they apt to be wrongly educated, or to draw\r\naround them harmful associates; to develop the most wearying and\r\nexhausting enthusiasms, or to choose a business and place of residence\r\nto which they are not adapted; to marry some one who will chiefly wear\r\nand burden them; to assume responsibilities and positions out of\r\nkeeping with their native strength and endurance; in fact, to get\r\nentangled in all the affairs of life in just the very way calculated\r\nto bring about the one thing which should have been, by every known\r\nmeans, sought to be avoided. It is in this way that \"physiological\r\nfate\" unconsciously spins the web which ultimately fastens its own\r\ndoom. That such a pernicious course should eventually result in\r\ndisaster is no wonder at all; for when investigated deeply and\r\ncomprehensively enough, it is seen that of all possible persons, such\r\nare, by birth, the very least calculated to endure the wear and tear\r\nthus engendered and maintained; while, as scarcely a word is ever\r\nheard and scarcely an effort is ever made as to the necessity for so\r\ntraining and educating and inspiring these people that the defects of\r\nheredity will be remedied, it follows that the most ordinary ventures\r\nof commonplace life are by far more dangerous to them than to their\r\nbetter-endowed fellows.[A] When properly endowed by heredity, and\r\nadequately bred and educated, it is almost beyond wonder, the amount\r\nand character of persistent stress which human nature can triumphantly\r\nendure. When otherwise, however, it is no wonder at all that sooner or\r\nlater serious breakdown comes to pass.\r\n\r\nThe importance of saying this is obvious when we consider that as a\r\nrule active life is allowed to be entered upon without adequate\r\npreparation and intelligent adaptation of either bodily or mental\r\nstrength to the stress that is likely to be encountered. Always it is\r\nasked, if anything is asked at all, \"Has he the skill to make his\r\nway?\" instead of, \"Has he the prospective endurance required by what\r\nhe purposes undertaking?\" while, if the latter chances to be\r\nconsidered at all, the conclusion is most usually based upon present\r\nappearances rather than upon past tendencies or actual developments.\r\nElsewhere I have said: \"In almost every instance (of breakdown) I\r\nhave come across the result of some big educational blunder, owing\r\neither to the system in vogue or else to those who execute it.\" (See\r\nSteps toward Insanity, New York Medical Journal, August 14, 1897.)\r\n\r\nThere is one fact about heredity which seems not to be commonly\r\nconsidered--namely, that each individual is really the descendant of\r\nnot only his immediate parents, but of the two lines of ancestry\r\nindefinitely far back and widespread. Thus, in many instances, the\r\ndominating characteristics are not those of father and mother, but of\r\ngrandparents, or of some other antecedent or collateral relatives\r\ninstead. In fact, each individual in its development from the germ to\r\nadulthood passes through not only many animal forms, but through many\r\nancestral phases of character as well. And, as in the first case, the\r\nsize and strength of adult physical features depend on the stage at\r\nwhich growth becomes abnormally extended, perverted, or arrested, so,\r\nwith regard to mental and moral qualities and their persistence under\r\nstress, the outcome mostly if not entirely depends upon the extent to\r\nwhich they are allowed or constrained to develop, or the reverse. Here\r\nwe often see the absolutely limiting influence of \"atavism,\" or what\r\nis characterized as \"reversion,\" to generations further removed than\r\nthe parental, but which really is the result of an exaggeration or a\r\nstoppage, or a perversion of development before the stage of parental\r\ndominance is finally reached. In this way the featural and mental\r\ncharacteristics of relatives as far removed as great-grandparents or\r\ngreat-granduncles, as well as grandparents and uncles, are seen to\r\nappear in children even when young, to be finally either accentuated\r\nand made prominent, or else possibly outgrown or otherwise overcome as\r\nthe years go by, and as the later parental determining powers and the\r\ncorresponding environment come to manifest their influence.\r\n\r\nWith this view of heredity in mind, it is easy to see how the real\r\nbasis of every mental breakdown may be and probably is simply an\r\noverdoing or perversion or other irregularity at some premature or\r\n\"atavistic\" stage of development; and that anything and everything\r\nwhich may have had to do in causing this should be considered as a\r\nprimary step toward the insanity itself. But easy as it is to see this\r\ntheoretically, it does not necessarily follow that it is easy to get\r\nhold of the real facts or to help the matter in any given case. Many\r\ntimes families are loath to reveal things which might indicate such a\r\nbasis of the dreaded disease. Many times they do not recognize the\r\nnecessity of telling what they would otherwise be willing enough to\r\nreveal. Many things are absolutely forgotten or have been at best only\r\nvaguely comprehended. Sometimes conscious deception is practiced; at\r\nothers, the party who really has known the facts is dead or is\r\notherwise inaccessible. But more often, and more interfering still, is\r\nthe unconscious perversion of facts, either from the false meanings\r\nwhich, owing to specific views and predilections and fears, are read\r\ninto them, not only by the laity, but often by the profession, or else\r\nfrom the wrong deductions derived from actual facts clearly\r\nunderstood. Try as one may, it is often most difficult to get a\r\nsufficient number of clearly defined facts to enable even the most\r\nexpert to form a true and comprehensive idea of the case in hand.[B]\r\nThis leads to the remark that what is now absolutely needed is some\r\nform of record-keeping which shall become a general practice on the\r\npart of heads of families and their physicians, and which may be\r\nhanded down from generation to generation; and not only this, but that\r\nthese shall be so accurately and fully kept that they may be worthy of\r\nconsideration as the best and in fact the only basis of a scientific\r\ngeneralization in case of mental or moral emergency. That people as a\r\nrule would probably resent this, as constituting an undue interference\r\nwith the sanctity of personal and family rights, while undoubtedly\r\nrendering it practically nugatory for the time being, does not in any\r\ngood sense militate against either the scientific need or the great\r\ngood which would accrue from the use of such family records faithfully\r\nand intelligently kept. It is encouraging to note that already the way\r\nfor such records is being opened in the demands made by the various\r\n_questionnaires_ sent out by Dr. G. Stanley Hall and others who are\r\ninterested in the scientific study of children. (See various issues of\r\nthe American Journal of Psychology, and of the Pedagogical Seminary,\r\nfor pertinent suggestions and results. Also an article by Dr. William\r\nH. Thomson, in the Yale Medical Journal for April, 1898.) Much more\r\nuseful and in general satisfactory would this be than the blind\r\nstaggering after elusory causation now so universally and yet so\r\nfutilely pursued.\r\n\r\nAnd the same may be said with reference to statistics as commonly\r\ntabulated. These having reference but to the surface showings, the\r\nafter-the-mischief-is-done results, and so often obtained under\r\nmisleading constraint or other unfavorable influences, are scarcely\r\ncapable of even hinting the significance of real conditions, and\r\nespecially of tendencies that have existed antecedent to the\r\nindividual breakdown. For instance, such statistics as those compiled\r\nby Dr. Wise (see State Hospitals Bulletin, vol. i, page 157), when\r\nsubjected to the requirements of an accurate causative consideration,\r\neasily lend themselves to the criticism made by the author himself,\r\nwho says, \"The careful inquirer can receive no reliable information\r\nfrom the study of insane hospital statistics except the bare fact of\r\nthe number of insane persons under care and treatment.\" Yet a glance\r\nat his tables shows that forty-two per cent of the cases admitted to\r\nthe New York State hospitals for the year ending September 30, 1895,\r\nare to be noted as suffering from constitutional degeneracies, and so\r\npresumably to be incurable. The more than twenty per cent of cases of\r\ninsanity reported to have had hereditary antecedents, although\r\nundoubtedly as accurate as possible under the circumstances, merely\r\nchronicle the more obvious matters, and must necessarily have left out\r\nof account all the less obvious but in many respects even more\r\nimportant ones. And so with all the other series thus far published.\r\nThey are good as indicating where we are to look for some of the steps\r\ntoward insanity, but for the most part they are quite inadequate for a\r\nbasis of comprehensive discussion or anything like accurate\r\nconclusion.\r\n\r\nThe pressing need, then, is that there shall be obtained a series of\r\nstatistics which shall be founded upon the most definite, penetrating,\r\nand far-reaching studies of cases that it is possible for the trained\r\nscientist, with the help of an intelligent, willing laity, to make. In\r\nthis respect it may be said that the assistance of the latter is just\r\nas essential as the painstaking devotion of the former; for it is upon\r\nthe facts which an intelligent laity can observe and report that the\r\nscientist can bring his training to bear in such a way as to arrive\r\neventually at accurate and therefore most useful generalizations. But\r\nsuch concurrent observation and study will never be until the public\r\nshall have come to look upon insanity as merely an unfortunate disease\r\ninstead of a stigmatized disgrace, which, with certain exceptions, it\r\nshould not be considered to be. Nor will this be the case until\r\nprofessional examiners in lunacy shall regularly ask for such family\r\nrecords, and thus create a need for their being made. When both the\r\npublic as well as the profession lay aside entirely the common notions\r\nof a transcendental origin of insanity, and set to work to study the\r\nperfectly natural steps through which degeneration and breakdown\r\neventually come to be, all will see the desirability of such health\r\nrecords being accurately and fully kept, not only as a help toward\r\ndetermining the nature and prospects of any given case, but also\r\ntoward preventing the development of those constitutional tendencies\r\nwhich lead to trouble, as well as in helping on those that provide\r\nagainst it.\r\n\r\nWhen we come to study the causes of insanity with a view to\r\nsuccessfully preventing it, we are led to the supposition that the\r\nnearer to very first steps we can push our investigations the greater\r\nwill be our service. Remembering that the well-born, well-bred\r\npersonality generally bears almost every sort of stress with\r\ncomparative impunity, it becomes us to ask just how does the\r\nopposite--the ill-born, ill-bred--constitution come so to be, and\r\nhence to break down so easily. Certainly, the weak, easily breaking\r\nstrains must have their origin and growth just as definitely as the\r\nmore enduring ones, and if we can get an accurate notion of such\r\norigin and the conditions of subsequent growth, it seems probable that\r\nuseful knowledge will thus be attained.\r\n\r\nWith this object in view an investigation was undertaken which should\r\ncover the life histories of a series of families with sufficient\r\ndetail and extension to warrant at least tentative conclusions as well\r\nas also to indicate probable lines for future work. So far as\r\npossible, inquiries were pushed along collateral as well as direct\r\nlines of ancestry; and not only ill health but common habits and\r\nexperiences were, so far as possible, given the consideration strictly\r\ntheir due. In every way the attempt was made to properly estimate the\r\nfactors appertaining to the more intimate personal life as well as\r\nthose that were more obvious and impersonal. Often, however, the\r\ncompleted record proved to be more or less broken; more often still,\r\nimportant items--the most important of all, in fact--could only be\r\nobtained under promise of absolute secrecy as to future use. So, as\r\nmatters of absolute science, the following conclusions must stand\r\nchiefly as challenges for future confirmation or change. But, so far\r\nas they can be allowed to go, they may be accepted as pretty\r\nthoroughly based in ascertained fact and legitimate generalization.\r\n\r\nThe very first conclusion, so far as the natural history of the steps\r\ntoward insanity is concerned, is that the weak constitutional strands\r\nand tendencies have their beginnings in those ancestral marriages\r\nwhich, chiefly for educational reasons, I have chosen to call\r\n\"unphysiological.\"[C] By an unphysiological marriage one need not mean\r\na marriage between people obviously deformed or imbecile or insane, or\r\notherwise permanently unfitted, but rather between people who are\r\nfound to be not well adapted to each other in some important sense.\r\nThus, too great physical disproportion; too great disparity of age, or\r\nof temperament, or of family or of natural tendencies; or, on the\r\nother hand, too near a sameness, either through consanguinity or other\r\nsources; or too fixed constitutional characteristics; or even too\r\ngreat differences of education, religion, taste, or ambition. In fact,\r\nit seems probable that anything and everything which difficultly\r\namalgamates in marriage, and as surely fails to blend in progeny, may\r\nbe considered as unphysiological in this connection. As I have said\r\nelsewhere: \"The parties entering into such an unphysiological marriage\r\nmay both be normal individually, but yet not physiologically\r\nmarriageable, because they are either too distantly or too nearly, or\r\nin fact too unphysiologically, related, either physically or\r\npsychically. In such cases the ultimate outcome is almost absolutely\r\ncertain, and is noted chiefly by a definite class of tensions and\r\nreactions of both mind and body which invariably impress themselves\r\nupon progeny, and which for the most part are made obvious in this\r\nparticular way. No matter how unphysiological such marriages may be,\r\nhowever, they do not necessarily or very often result in the evolution\r\nof insanity in the parties contracting them, but rather they do lay\r\nthe foundation of degenerative tendencies which almost invariably\r\npredetermine the development of this affection in more or less remote\r\nsucceeding generations. Nor do the children of such marriages\r\nnecessarily or generally become insane, although they sometimes do;\r\nbut, impressed as these are by the degenerative malnutritions and\r\ntensions and reactions of their parents, they tend to exhibit arrests\r\nand eccentricities of development, which in turn become intensified in\r\nthe next, and again, in turn, in all the generations following, until\r\nthe instability becomes so marked that explosion occurs. In passing,\r\nit may be said that the most frequent source of the initiatory\r\ntensions and reactions resulting from unphysiological marriage is\r\nundoubtedly found in abnormal cohabitation, and the unrest and\r\nunsatisfaction and exhaustion resulting therefrom. Such a condition of\r\nthings begets in perfectly normal people an irritating, nagging,\r\nexhausting, persistent erethism, which in time involves the whole\r\norganism and deflects it from its norm. Two people enmeshed in such a\r\nbond always go to excesses and irregularities, either in abstinence or\r\nindulgence; or, if not this, then the whole matter becomes aversional,\r\nwith straining antipathy, perverting practices, and ideational\r\ndistrusts and loathings more and more predominating. No wonder that\r\nsuch people predetermine succeeding generations to abnormal\r\nsensitiveness, irregular growth, and erratic manifestations in both\r\nmental and physical spheres.\" (See New York Medical Journal for August\r\n14, 1897; also Journal of Nervous and Mental Diseases, vol. xvii, page\r\n669.)\r\n\r\nNow, the outcome of such marriages seems to be a vitiated stream of\r\ntendency, which carries with it in its progress from generation to\r\ngeneration certain elements which predetermine to still fuller\r\nvitiation, even with incurable insanity, as noted above. Thus, people\r\nendowed with such natural characteristics, being altogether too prone\r\nto gravitate toward each other, eventually marry, and thus emphasize\r\nin progeny the vitiation already doubly initiated. Nature's course\r\ndemands that such people marry, if at all, into the healthiest, most\r\ncorrective stock possible. But here immediately there arises not only\r\na scientific prohibition, but an ethical question which should be\r\nheeded: Should such people really marry even the best of stock, with\r\nthe probability of thus vitiating a stream which until this time has\r\nevidently been becoming clearer and stronger? Again, people who are\r\nconstitutionally tending to mental breakdown are very apt to load\r\nthemselves down with duties and get themselves into situations which\r\nmust necessarily prove to be too onerous and too perplexing for their\r\npoorly developed strength and skill. Of course, circumstances often\r\nrequire this. Many times, however, there is a kind of impulsive\r\nrestlessness coupled with a short-sighted optimism, both\r\nconstitutional, which, altogether more than ordinary circumstances,\r\nare to blame for undue assumption of work or care, and whose effect\r\nis, perhaps, best seen in the persistent tendency of such people to\r\noriginate and perpetuate exhausting habits, both of mind and body.\r\nThus, the habit of self-poisoning from poorly digested and poorly\r\nassimilated food is easily acquired by such people, and always becomes\r\na source of progressive brain starvation and often of consequent\r\nmental breakdown. Says Dr. A. S. Thayer (Journal of Medicine and\r\nScience, vol. iii, page 173), \"There is ground for belief that\r\nexhaustion--fatigue--is dependent upon poisoning of the cells of the\r\nbrain, muscles, and other tissues by the waste products of functional\r\nactivity.\"[D] Again, as already noted, perversions of the natural\r\ninstincts--of appetite for food, of desire for gain, of social or\r\nother ambitions, and especially of the sexual impulse and its habitual\r\nindulgence--fasten themselves upon such individuals with a permanence\r\nand destructiveness that must almost of necessity lead to disaster.[E]\r\nAnd so we may see that as a most natural, although often a\r\nfar-removed, result of unphysiological marriages, proceeding through\r\ngenerations which have been thus predestinated to weakening choices\r\nand practices, insanity finally appears to mark the ultimate extent\r\nboth of the mental disorganization and bodily inefficiency, which\r\nextent is owing not only to the original initiating steps, but also to\r\nsubsequent stages of causation, progressively developed from\r\ngeneration to generation.\r\n\r\nAnother great source of vitiation of the stream of tendency is found\r\nin two people who marry in a truly enough physiological sense, but who\r\nfind or force themselves in lives of wear and tear which progressively\r\nunfit them for childbearing and child nurture. Poorly calculated\r\nambitions, unexpected difficulties to be surmounted, depressing\r\noppositions, with perhaps more or less actual disease or accident,\r\nlargely account for this in a general way. Obviously, during the\r\nchild-rearing age, the effect of what parents are obliged to endure\r\nand execute upon the fortunes of progeny becomes a matter of\r\nfar-reaching importance. That anything which persistently exhausts or\r\noverstrains the parents must tell in the later dynamic tendency and\r\ndevelopment is premised at least by certain recent studies, especially\r\nthose of Hodge on the influence of fatigue, and of Van Gieson on the\r\neffects of exhaustion and intoxication upon the nervous elements. (See\r\nalso Peterson, _op. cit._) In no sense can parents be said to live for\r\nthemselves chiefly. Always the influence of their own health,\r\nhappiness, and prosperity upon their children should be remembered,\r\nand should be made as constructive as possible. That this can be\r\nconsciously attempted with commensurate results is more or less\r\nevidenced not only by common observation but by investigation. Not,\r\nhowever, in the sense that parents are always able to endow children\r\nwith some particular, much-wished-for characteristic, as so many\r\nsuppose--for it must be remembered that perhaps pretty fixed\r\ntendencies for several generations may have to be overcome and\r\nreversed before such special results can be obtained, but in the much\r\nbetter sense of giving such an impetus healthward and strengthward and\r\nlifeward as may later on be the beginning of a constitutional\r\nfoundation that shall support many generations of full health and\r\nlongevity.\r\n\r\nIf, then, the first steps--and, generally speaking, the most important\r\nsteps--are discovered in the unphysiological marriage and its\r\ninfluence upon the bearing and rearing of progeny, then it is obvious\r\nenough that prevention of incurable insanity should begin with giving\r\nadequate attention to this phase of the subject, and this first and\r\nemphatically. Already the law says that certain peculiarly afflicted\r\nindividuals can not marry; and probably this is about as far as the\r\nlaw can helpfully go until, at least, public intelligence as well as\r\nprivate sentiment will sustain it in going further. So we must look to\r\nthese latter--a widespread intelligence and a corresponding earnest\r\nsentiment founded upon such intelligence--for the means of making\r\nprogress toward the prevention of insanity. But how can this needed\r\nknowledge and helpful sentiment come to be? Certainly not by\r\nperpetuating the present notions of so-called \"modesty\" and \"purity,\"\r\nwhich, as now held, must always interfere with the study and practice\r\nnecessary for ascertaining the truth, and for applying it to the needs\r\nof race-building. The time ought to come soon, very soon, when matters\r\nof such serious content shall not be so absolutely subject to the\r\ndominance of conventionality and guesswork and recklessness as now,\r\nbut shall instead be subject to the sway of accurate science and its\r\ncareful adaptation to human conditions. Every marriage now is at best\r\nbut an experiment--blind and chance-taking often, in a most wasteful\r\nand dangerous sense. Let it remain, if it must, an experiment still,\r\nbut one which shall be henceforth conducted with such foresight and\r\nskill, and withal with such intelligent purpose, as shall certainly\r\npoint to improved results from generation to generation. Experience\r\nshows that it is comparatively easy to ascertain what marriages,\r\ngenerally speaking, are prone to result in obviously vitiated progeny;\r\nor if not in these, then, to some extent at least, in the progeny\r\nwhich, being unnaturally constituted, are prone to develop their\r\nweaker strands of personality, and so to break down in the end. But to\r\nthis course neither prudery nor superstition nor selfishness will ever\r\nassent; it must be pursued in spite of these, and by the only method\r\nwhich science now recognizes--namely, accurate observation, careful\r\nrecord, and the most comprehensive, skillful comparison, all in order\r\nthat truthful inductions may be finally secured. That parents should\r\ntrain up their children to look forward to marriage not as the acme of\r\npersonal indulgence and satisfaction, but as a most responsible\r\npartnership for the developmental keeping of unborn fortunes, and the\r\nproper nurturing of the children that may come to them, is no longer\r\nspeculation, but a science-founded fact. Undoubtedly the highest state\r\nof adult satisfaction will always be closely associated with what may\r\nbe characterized as child completion. Moreover, that an educational\r\nsystem which so thoroughly ignores this most important of all\r\neducational subjects must, in time, be subjected to the criticism\r\nwhich science may justly develop, is amply borne out by the cases\r\nstudied. Often, indeed, has it appeared that had a modicum of real\r\nknowledge been at hand, most disastrous results would naturally have\r\nbeen obviated. Educators lead the day; why not they lead in directions\r\nwhich shall most truly correct the results of physiological ignorance\r\nand daring? That no man or woman should go forth from college with\r\nsuch vital knowledge unlearned is probably the first and most\r\nimportant means of preventing incurable insanity conceivable; and that\r\nthese in turn should never hesitate to diffuse popularly that which\r\nthey have been so favored in the learning, implies a duty which the\r\nintelligence itself makes clear.\r\n\r\nSo, too, if persistent overstrain and exhaustion of parents, either\r\nprospective or actual, leads directly to starvation of their own\r\nstructural elements, how probable that the initiating and bearing and\r\nnurturing of children is to a like extent detrimentally interfered\r\nwith in any given case through the development of an \"erratic cell\r\ngrowth.\" Certain it is that completeness of development depends on two\r\nthings--namely, nutrition and exercise. In a biological sense both\r\nthese are dependent upon a right adjustment of supply to demand. Hence\r\nstarvation or engorgement, inactivity or overwork, each may lead to\r\nthe same dynamic result--that is to say, to an interference with the\r\nproper growth of the organism. That due heed, then, should always be\r\ngiven to the necessary health preservation of those who essay to\r\nbecome parents, not only in preparation for but during the whole\r\nso-called childbearing period, is so scientifically deducible that it\r\nmay be for all practical purposes considered as axiomatic. The way to\r\nhave healthy, long-lived, and happy children is for parents to be\r\nhealthful and intelligently careful themselves; while the whole\r\nscience of health must eventually consist in the science of such\r\nsymmetrical and high development as will enable individuals to endure\r\nnecessary strain, resist disease, and rapidly and fully recover from\r\naccident and infection.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[A] \"It is perfectly certain that two in every three children are\r\nirretrievably damaged or hindered in their mental and moral\r\ndevelopment in the schools; but I am not sure that they would fare\r\nbetter if they stayed at home.\"--Baldwin, in _Mental Development_, p.\r\n38.\r\n\r\n[B] See an instance clearly elucidative of this in an account of the\r\nKelly murder trial, given by Dr. Walter Channing in the American\r\nJournal of Insanity for January, 1898, page 385.\r\n\r\n[C] See New York Medical Journal for August 14, 1897.\r\n\r\n[D] See also Dr. Edward Cowles.

State Hospitals\r\nBulletin, vol. i, p. 327.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSKETCH OF WILLIAM PENGELLY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe name of William Pengelly is most closely associated with the\r\nexplorations of caves in England containing relics of men together\r\nwith the remains of extinct animals, the results of which, confirming\r\nsimilar conclusions that had been reached in France, convinced English\r\ngeologists of man's extreme antiquity. Speaking of him at the time of\r\nhis death as one of the last survivors of the heroes who laid the\r\nfoundation of geological science, Prof. T. G. Bonney said, \"He has\r\nleft behind an example of what one man can do in advancing knowledge\r\nby energy and perseverance.\"\r\n\r\nWILLIAM PENGELLY was born at East Looe, a fishing village in Cornwall,\r\nEngland, January 12, 1812, and died in Torquay, March 16, 1894. The\r\nname of Pengelly is not uncommon in Cornwall, and has figured in\r\nEnglish history--among others, in the person of Sir Thomas Pengelly,\r\nwho was chief baron of the exchequer, and left certain sums for the\r\ndischarge of debtors from the jails of Bodmin and Launceston. His\r\nfather was captain of a small coasting vessel, and he acquired a\r\nstrong attachment to the sea. He was sent to the Dame's School in his\r\nnative village when very young, and before he was five years old had\r\nmade so rapid progress that his mother applied to the master of a\r\nschool for larger boys to receive him as a pupil. The master declined\r\nto take him, but, hearing him reading as he passed the door of the\r\nhouse not long afterward, concluded to grant the mother's request. At\r\nschool he soon gained such a reputation for scholarship that the boys\r\nmade him spend all his play hours helping them in their lessons. His\r\nschool days ended when he was twelve years old, and he accompanied his\r\nfather to sea, making, however, voyages that were seldom more than\r\nthree days long, most of the work of which consisted in taking in and\r\ntaking out cargo. The sailors soon discovered his clerkly gifts and\r\nemployed him to write their letters, but did not so well appreciate\r\nhis excellent conversational powers. On \"tailoring days\" it was\r\nunderstood that his clothes should be repaired for him, while he read\r\naloud for the general benefit, and the sailors would amuse themselves\r\nby finding solutions to questions in Walkingham's Arithmetic. His\r\nseafaring life closed in his sixteenth year, when the death of a\r\nbrother made it desirable that he should remain at home.\r\n\r\nThough working hard all the day for a mere support, young Pengelly\r\nmanaged to spend several hours every night in study, seeking to master\r\nmathematics. He had no tutor and no really good text-books, but made\r\nsuch progress in his studies that in a comparatively short time he\r\nbecame \"a mathematical tutor of no mean order.\" He bought his first\r\nEuclid of a peddler who occasionally visited the place; then, having\r\nsaved up a little money for the purpose, it was a happy day for him\r\nwhen he walked thirty miles to Devonport and back, bearing, on his\r\nreturn, twenty volumes in a bundle over his shoulder; among them were\r\nthe works of some of the standard authors, for he cultivated a\r\nliterary as well as a mathematical taste.\r\n\r\nHe received his first lesson in geology while he was still a sailor\r\nboy, at Lyme Regis--a spot exceedingly rich in fossils. A laborer whom\r\nhe was observing broke a stone, the opening of which disclosed a fine\r\nammonite. To his question as to what the fossil was, the laborer\r\nreplied that if he had read his Bible he would have known; that there\r\nwas once a flood that covered all the world; the things that were\r\ndrowned were buried in the mud, and this was a snake which had\r\nsuffered that fate. \"A snake! but where's his head?\" He was again\r\nreferred to the Bible, which would tell him why the snakes in the\r\nrocks had no heads. \"We're told there that the seed of the woman shall\r\nbruise the serpent's head. That's how 'tis.\" The second lesson came a\r\nfew years later, in a reading club of which Pengelly was a member.\r\nThey were reading Dick's Christian Philosopher, and came to a\r\ngeological section, when the reader remarked that \"as geology was very\r\nlikely to be extremely dry, and as many good people thought it\r\ndangerous if not decidedly infidel in its teachings, he would propose\r\nthat the selection should not be read. This was passed by acclamation,\r\nand the reader passed on to astronomy.\"\r\n\r\nWhile still young, Pengelly removed to Torquay, where he spent the\r\nremainder of his life. Shortly after arriving there, he opened a small\r\nday school on the Pestalozzian system, into which he introduced the\r\nnovelty of the use of chalk and the blackboard in giving instruction.\r\nBeginning with six pupils, the school grew rapidly. He had private\r\npupils, too, and in 1846 these had become so numerous that he gave up\r\nhis school, and as a special tutor in mathematics and the natural\r\nsciences found his life occupation. Some of his pupils became\r\ndistinguished in after life; while others, like the two Russian\r\nprinces, nephews of the Czar Alexander II, and Princess Mary, of the\r\nNetherlands, all of whom became much attached to him, were famous by\r\nreason of their position. His attention was brought for a third time\r\nto geology while looking over some books which he thought might be\r\nuseful to his pupils, when he found one published by the brothers\r\nChambers, which contained a chapter on that science. This was not\r\nmuch, but it was enough to inform him how much had already been done\r\nin geology, and, perhaps, to give him a hint of some of the\r\npossibilities that lay in it. From this time on, he was ardently\r\ninterested in geology. The journal of his first visit to London and\r\nthe British Museum, in 1843, attests how he was becoming absorbed in\r\nit. He spent his holidays in geological explorations and in excursions\r\nwhich gradually grew larger, until his position as a geologist was\r\nrecognized, and he became an authority respecting all points and\r\nphenomena which had come under his personal knowledge. A hint dropped\r\nto him by Professor Jameson as he was about to visit the Isle of Arran\r\ntaught him to make his notes of observations on the spot, and greatly\r\nhelped, his daughter Hester observes in the biography on which we have\r\ndrawn very largely, \"to form those habits of extreme accuracy which\r\ncharacterized all his scientific work.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1837 Mr. Pengelly assisted in the reorganization of the Torquay\r\nMechanics' Institute, with which he maintained a connection for more\r\nthan twenty years, and before which he delivered many lectures. In\r\n1844 he participated in the organization of the Torquay Natural\r\nHistory Society, of which he became, in 1851, honorary secretary, and\r\nremained so for more than thirty-nine years. \"Under his guidance it\r\nbecame a scientific power in the country. Year after year he lectured\r\nthere, tincturing the locality with his own enthusiasm; and from the\r\nsociety there ultimately sprang the museum in Babbacombe Road, with\r\nits admirable collections.\"\r\n\r\nHis lectures, delivered gratuitously at Torquay, were very popular,\r\nand were attended by large audiences. The fame of them spread, and he\r\nwas called to other places--Exeter, Exmouth, and larger towns and\r\nfarther off, and to the great learned societies--where he lectured,\r\nalways with success, and to the satisfaction and delight of his\r\naudiences. \"Those persons living, and they are many,\" says Mr. F. S.\r\nEllis in the preface to Hester Pengelly's biography of her father,\r\n\"who had the good fortune to hear Pengelly lecture will bear ready\r\nwitness to the complete mastery he always had of his subject, and of\r\nthe faculty of imparting his knowledge. Even when speaking upon\r\nabstruse subjects to a mixed audience, he would make the matter\r\nperfectly clear without in any degree appearing to talk down to the\r\ncapacity of those he was addressing.... His manner was no less\r\npleasing and attractive than the language in which he clothed his\r\nideas was grateful to the ear.\" Geology and astronomy furnished the\r\nsubjects of the lectures.\r\n\r\nIt would be impracticable in a brief sketch to follow the detail of\r\nPengelly's geological investigations previous to his engaging in\r\nsystematic cave exploration. They embraced fields chiefly in\r\nDevonshire and Cornwall, and afforded subjects for correspondence and\r\ndiscussion with many of the most eminent British geologists, and some\r\nof other countries than England. A study of some fossil fish, first\r\nobserved by Mr. Charles W. Peach in Cornwall, furnished the occasion\r\nfor one of his first recorded papers, On the Ichthyolites of East\r\nCornwall, in the Transactions of the Royal Geological Society of East\r\nCornwall, 1849-'50; and a single volume--the seventh--of these\r\nTransactions contains nine of his papers. Another subject of interest\r\nwas the beekites, curious formations of chalcedonic silica on the\r\nlimestone fragments in the New Red Sandstone of Devonshire, first\r\nobserved by Dr. Beek, of Bristol, concerning which he read a paper at\r\nthe Cheltenham meeting of the British Association, the first which he\r\nattended, in 1856. In 1860 he completed the formation of a collection\r\nof Devonian fossils from Devon and Cornwall, which was presented by\r\nthe Baroness Burdett-Coutts to the new museum of the University of\r\nOxford, in connection with the foundation of a geological scholarship,\r\nand was named \"the Pengelly Collection.\"\r\n\r\nThe first of the more important geological researches with which\r\nPengelly's name is intimately associated was the exploration of the\r\npeculiar formation at Bovey Tracey, for the identification of its\r\nfossils and the determination of its age. The plain in which the\r\nformation lay had an aspect suggesting the basin of an ancient lake,\r\nand its deposits, \"very different from the solid rocks of the\r\nsurrounding hills,\" confirmed the suggestion. They consisted of\r\ngravels, sands, and clays, distinctly stratified, with seams of\r\nlignite, for which they had been worked. The pits had already\r\nattracted some notice, and the deposits had been mentioned in\r\nscientific literature, but very little had been learned concerning\r\ntheir age. In 1860 the subject was mentioned by the late Dr. Falconer,\r\nan eminent paleontologist, to Miss Burdett-Coutts as one the\r\ninvestigation of which would be a boon to science. Miss Coutts\r\nsupplied the money that was needed, and the direction of the\r\nsystematic investigation was intrusted to Pengelly; on learning which,\r\nSir Charles Lyell wrote to him: \"I am very glad of the prospect of our\r\nknowing something of the Bovey coal plants. It is almost a reproach to\r\nEnglish geology that they have been so little explored, as they are\r\nperhaps the only fossils of the Tertiary period to which they belong.\"\r\nIn order to determine accurately the nature, thickness, and order of\r\nthe successive beds, and to make a satisfactory collection of fossils,\r\na new section of the deposit was made, measuring one hundred and\r\ntwenty-five feet, down to the bottom of a seam of lignite four feet in\r\nthickness, the \"last bed\" of the workmen, but not at the actual base\r\nof the deposit. Thirteen of the thirty-one beds of lignite which were\r\ncut through, and two of the beds of clay, yielded distinguishable\r\nplant remains. These were sent to Dr. Oswald Heer, of Switzerland, for\r\nexamination; and he determined from the collection fifty species,\r\nincluding ferns, conifers, figs, cinnamon trees, an oak, a laurel,\r\nvines, andromedas, a bilberry, a gardenia, a water lily, and some\r\nleguminous plants. Heer referred the group to the Lower Miocene\r\nperiod, but some modification was afterward made in this determination\r\nin the light of a fuller knowledge of the Tertiary flora. The deposits\r\nand work at Bovey Tracey were the subject of a memoir to the Royal\r\nSociety by Sir Charles Lyell; and Dr. Heer's account of his work--The\r\nFossil Flora of Bovey Tracey--was published in 1863.\r\n\r\nWhile this investigation was going on, Lyell was preparing the fifth\r\nedition of his Manual of Geology. He invited Pengelly to suggest\r\ncorrections to the text, saying that, besides positive mistakes, he\r\nwould \"be glad of any hints and suggestions made freely, which your\r\nknowledge of the manner in which beginners are struck may enable you\r\nto send us.\" The criticisms supplied by Mr. Pengelly were adopted by\r\nLyell except where they had already been made unnecessary.\r\n\r\nOn the accidental discovery by workmen, in 1858, of a cavern in\r\nWindmill Hill, overhanging the town of Brixham, Pengelly at once\r\nthought of finding what was in it, and what story it might have to\r\ntell. He visited the place and applied to the owner for permission to\r\nexplore it in behalf of the Torquay Natural History Society. But on\r\nconsultation with Dr. Hugh Falconer it was decided that as that\r\nsociety probably had not means sufficient to bear the expense of the\r\nexploration, the Royal and Geographical Societies should be applied to\r\nfor a grant. This was obtained, and the work was carried on under the\r\nsuperintendence of Professor Prestwich and Mr. Pengelly, on whom, as a\r\nresident of the place, the burden substantially fell. The decision to\r\nexplore the cave was brought about largely by the fact that it was a\r\nvirgin cave which had been inaccessibly closed during an incalculably\r\nlong period, the last previous event in its history having been the\r\nintroduction of a reindeer antler, which was found attached to the\r\nupper surface of the stalagmitic floor. It was therefore free from the\r\nobjection urged against Kent's Cavern that, having been long known and\r\nopen, it had probably been ransacked again and again. A thorough\r\nmethod of exploration was determined upon, beginning with the\r\nexamination and removal of the stalagmitic floor; after which the\r\nupper bed should be dealt with in a similar manner horizontally\r\nthroughout the entire length of the cavern, or so far as practicable;\r\nthen the next lower bed, and so on, till all the deposits had been\r\nremoved. By this method the general stratigraphical order of the\r\ndeposits and their characteristics could be learned, all their fossils\r\nsecured, and the highest possible exactness attained. The excavations\r\nwere continued through twelve months, at the end of which the cave had\r\nbeen practically emptied. Besides furnishing interesting indications\r\nrelative to its physical history, the cave yielded sixteen hundred and\r\ntwenty-one bones and thirty-six flints. While most of the flints were\r\nflakes, some of which possibly might not be artificial, three were\r\nfairly well made implements of paleolithic type; and it was therefore\r\nconcluded that man either frequented or at any rate sometimes entered\r\nthe Brixham Cave while Devonshire was inhabited by various mammals\r\nwhich are now extinct. Previous to the execution of this work, all\r\ngeological evidence as to the antiquity of man had been received, even\r\nby English geologists of the first rank, with what Pengelly called\r\napathy and skepticism. After the work it soon became evident, Pengelly\r\nsaid in an address to the Section of Anthropology of the British\r\nAssociation, in 1883, that this geological apathy had been more\r\napparent than real. \"In fact, geologists were found to have been not\r\nso much disinclined to entertain the question of human antiquity, as\r\nto doubt the trustworthiness of the evidence which had previously been\r\noffered to them on the subject.\" The discoveries are thought to have\r\nhad a considerable share in disposing Mr. Prestwich to undertake the\r\ninvestigation of the remains at Amiens and Abbeville in France and\r\nHoxne in England, \"which added to his own great reputation and rescued\r\nM. Boucher de Perthes from undeserved neglect.\" Prof. Boyd Dawkins\r\nsays that they established beyond all doubt the existence of\r\npaleolithic man in the Pleistocene age, and caused the whole of the\r\nscientific world to awake to the fact of the vast antiquity of the\r\nhuman race. Of course, they aroused a theological controversy which\r\nwas long and bitter, and has only recently died out. Pengelly had no\r\ntrouble through it all. \"Geologists,\" he said, \"see no mode of\r\nreconciling the Mosaic account of creation with geological science....\r\nFor myself, I am satisfied that science can do nothing for the\r\nsalvation of the soul, and that the Bible is able, through God's\r\ngrace, to make us wise unto salvation.\" No doubts or difficulties\r\ncould ever undermine his faith as a Christian.\r\n\r\nThe evidence accumulated at Brixham suggested the propriety of a\r\nre-examination of other evidences of man's antiquity, and\r\nparticularly, in England, of those from Kent's Hole, or Cavern, at\r\nTorquay. The existence of this cave had been known from time\r\nimmemorial, but the first recorded exploration of it was made in 1824\r\nby Mr. Northmore, of Cleve, looking for organic remains and an ancient\r\ntemple of Mithras. Mr. W. C. Trevelyan followed him, and first\r\nobtained results of value to science. The Rev. J. MacEnery, a Roman\r\nCatholic priest, began a four years' exploration of the cave in 1825,\r\nand prepared a narrative of his work, which was not published for\r\nseveral years after his death, having been lost, and found by Pengelly\r\nafter a long search. He showed that the cave had been inhabited,\r\npractically at the same time, by man and various extinct animals; but\r\nthe antiquity of man not being yet a live subject, little regard was\r\npaid to his evidences. With a grant of a hundred pounds from the\r\nBritish Association, the work was begun under the direction of a\r\ncommittee of which Pengelly was the leading spirit and the working\r\nmember. It opened a new chapter in his life, his daughter says, \"for\r\nhe not only superintended the exploration of the cavern, but undertook\r\nits entire management, throwing himself, heart and soul, into the\r\nnumerous duties which it entailed. The labor was arduous, and severely\r\ntaxed his energies for fifteen years; but it was a congenial\r\nemployment, and most faithfully performed.... After undertaking the\r\nexploration, Pengelly became such an enthusiast in the progress made\r\nthat, when in Torquay, he never (unless prevented by illness) failed\r\non a single week day to visit the cavern, while he devoted many hours\r\nat home in the examination of the specimens exhumed. He even abridged\r\nhis short holidays, and all idea of living in London was abandoned on\r\nthis account.\" In the investigation, the surface accumulations having\r\nbeen removed and preserved for examination, the floor of granular\r\nstalagmite was stripped off, so as to lay bare the cave earth, and\r\nthis was dug out ultimately to a depth of four feet in a series of\r\nprismatic blocks, a yard long and a foot square in section, layer by\r\nlayer. This material was examined in the cave by candlelight, then at\r\nthe door by daylight. A box was appropriated to each \"yard,\" in which\r\nall the objects of interest found in that particular earth were put.\r\nThe boxes, with the record of what they contained, were sent daily to\r\nPengelly, who cleaned the articles and repacked them, and kept regular\r\nrecords of his day's works. Other materials were dealt with with\r\nsimilar thoroughness in ways according to their nature. \"Whatever was\r\ndiscovered beneath the stalagmite flooring must have been sealed up by\r\nit for, at the very least, two thousand years, probably for a much\r\nlonger time.\" The exploration was completed June 19, 1880. The more\r\nthan seventy-three hundred prisms of material which proved productive\r\nyielded, besides fifty thousand bones examined by Prof. Boyd Dawkins,\r\nnumerous implements, including those of bone, the work of man. Two\r\ndeposits were evident, one of \"cave earth,\" and one of breccia beneath\r\nit. A glance at the implements from them showed that they were very\r\ndissimilar. Those from the breccia were more massive and ruder in\r\nevery way than the others, and none of them were of bone. \"In short,\r\nthe stone tools, though both sets were unpolished and coeval with\r\nextinct mammals, represent two distinct civilizations. It is equally\r\nclear that the ruder men were the more ancient, for their tools were\r\nlodged in a deposit which, whenever the two occurred in the same\r\nvertical section, was invariably the undermost.\" Various conditions in\r\nthe deposits united in indicating that the interval between them must\r\nhave been very considerable. Other caves were examined by Pengelly,\r\nbut his most important discoveries were made in those of Brixham and\r\nKent.\r\n\r\nA third section of Pengelly's scientific work reviewed by Prof. T. G.\r\nBonney in the summary he has added to Miss Pengelly's biography, from\r\nwhich we have quoted freely, includes miscellaneous papers on geology\r\nand kindred subjects, relating almost exclusively to the southwest of\r\nEngland. As a rule, the papers are comparatively short, being the\r\nfruits of researches which either did not demand a long time, or could\r\nbe carried on at intervals as circumstances allowed, and appeared\r\nmostly in the transactions of local societies.\r\n\r\nPengelly was one of the prime movers and a leading spirit in the\r\norganization, in 1862, of the Devonshire Association for the\r\nAdvancement of Science, Literature, and Art, at Plymouth, and was its\r\npresident in 1867-'68. The objects of the association were \"to give a\r\nstronger impulse and a more systematic direction to scientific inquiry\r\nin Devonshire, and to promote the intercourse of those who cultivate\r\nscience, literature, or art in different parts of the country.\" It\r\nworked according to the methods of the British Association, with\r\nliterature and art added to its objects, besides giving some attention\r\nto history and archæology. The first meeting was held under the\r\npresidency of Sir John Bowring. In 1872 the president was the bishop\r\nof the diocese, Dr. Temple, now Archbishop of Canterbury. In 1863\r\nPengelly was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society.\r\n\r\nFrom 1856, when he read a paper at the Cheltenham meeting, Mr.\r\nPengelly was almost a constant attendant upon the meetings of the\r\nBritish Association, and gained, as the years advanced, a prominent\r\nposition among its leading members. He was president of the Geological\r\nSection at the Plymouth meeting, 1877. At the jubilee meeting of the\r\nassociation, held at York in 1880, he made the acquaintance of Prof.\r\nAsa Gray, which ripened into a friendship and resulted in a visit of\r\nProfessor Gray and Mrs. Gray to Torquay. He met another distinguished\r\nAmerican man of science, Prof. O. C. Marsh, recently deceased, at the\r\nInternational Geological Congress in London, in 1888. In 1801 he\r\nreceived a visit from Prof. G. F. Wright. He opposed the transference\r\nof the meeting of the British Association to Montreal in 1884, on\r\naccount of the expense and the sacrifice of time which he thought many\r\nwho would like to attend could not afford, and did not go himself. In\r\nMarch, 1874, he was visited at Torquay by Professor Phillips and\r\nothers in behalf of a number of members of the British Association,\r\nand presented with an illuminated parchment containing the signatures\r\nof the contributors and a check, as a testimonial \"in recognition of\r\nhis long and valued services to science in general, and more\r\nespecially for the exploration of Kent's Cavern. Replying to the\r\naddresses, he said he had done the work in connection with Kent's\r\nCavern simply because he liked it.... He had experienced intense\r\npleasure in it, and he could assure them that, on his finding a\r\n_Machairodus latidus_, after seven years and a half exploration, the\r\ndiscovery of that one tooth, in his opinion, was worth all the money\r\nthat had been spent in the exploration of the cavern.\"\r\n\r\nBesides geology, Mr. Pengelly had a living concern with astronomy, on\r\nsubjects of which he lectured and read papers, and in folklore, and\r\nwas \"extremely interested\" in the religious history of Cornwall. He\r\nbecame a member of the Society of Friends about 1853, and married his\r\nsecond wife, Lydia Spriggs, in that body. She assisted him in his\r\nscientific work, preparing diagrams.\r\n\r\nOf Pengelly's character as a man, Professor Bonney speaks of the great\r\ncharm in his personality, and the union in him of \"such strong mental\r\npowers, and no less strong sense of what was just, true, and right, to\r\nsuch genuine humor and hearty enjoyment of wit.\" Sir Archibald Geikie\r\nspeaks of his \"genial, kindly, and helpful nature, and his invariably\r\nbright, cheery, and witty talk.\" Prof. Rupert Jones characterizes him\r\nas \"a good example of a religious man--earnest, persevering, and exact\r\nin scientific research.\" The Rev. Robert Hardy says, \"He did not\r\nobtrude his theological opinions, but it was easy to perceive that he\r\nwas a man of true religious character.\" Sir Joseph Lister, looking\r\nback to the times of his acquaintance with him, recalled \"vividly the\r\nimpression of his great intellectual powers, his genial benevolence,\r\nand his sparkling humor.\"\r\n\r\nAs a lecturer his style is described as having been \"most attractive.\r\nIt is incisive, clear, and at times there are touches of humor. His\r\nperfect knowledge of the subject, combined with intense earnestness,\r\nclothed his lecture with genuine eloquence.\"\r\n\r\nMiss Pengelly's biography abounds with illustrations of her father's\r\nrare faculty of attracting and interesting workingmen. A letter from\r\none such man expresses gratitude, mingled with great pleasure, for the\r\nlasting happiness he was \"so anxious and constant to impart to us\r\nyoung men during the Young Men's Society and afterward at the\r\nMechanics' Institute, ... and I have often felt and said I owe more\r\ngratitude for the small amount of knowledge I possess, to Mr.\r\nPengelly, of Torquay, than to any living man, and I think there are a\r\nfew now in Torquay who might truly say so too.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEditor's Table.\r\n\r\n\r\n_KINDERGARTENIZED CHILDREN._\r\n\r\nWe do not know whether the verb \"to kindergartenize\" has yet crept\r\ninto the language, but, after reading the article of Miss Marion\r\nHamilton Carter in the March Atlantic on The Kindergarten Child--after\r\nthe kindergarten, one is disposed to think that such a verb is a\r\npresent necessity. The question as to whether the kindergarten on the\r\nwhole is a good institution is too wide for discussion within the\r\nrestricted limits of the Table; but no one can read Miss Carter's\r\narticle without being forced to the conclusion that, in some of its\r\naspects, kindergarten work is of very doubtful utility. That lady\r\nfound by actual experience with two or three successive levies of\r\nkindergarten children that they seemed to have an impaired rather than\r\nan improved faculty of acquiring knowledge, that their infancy seemed\r\nto have been artificially prolonged, that they had become accustomed\r\nto a nauseating amount of endearment in the language addressed to them\r\nby their instructors, that they seemed to expect to be continually\r\namused, and that a certain drill through which they had been put for\r\nthe alleged purpose of developing their powers of imagination had gone\r\na long way toward making them incapable of speaking of things simply\r\nas they found them. All this is set forth in Miss Carter's article in\r\na manner which leaves little doubt that she has described things\r\nsubstantially as they fell under her observation.\r\n\r\nThere is one important principle in education which it seems to us the\r\nkindergarten system too much ignores, if it does not completely set it\r\nat defiance, and that is that very young children require a great deal\r\nof letting alone. The spontaneous activity of the little ones--and\r\nthey are sure to be active if they get the chance--is worth more for\r\ntheir education than any amount of directed activity. Their\r\nimaginations, too, will take care of themselves much better than we\r\ncan take care of them. Nothing is less favorable to the development of\r\nimagination in a child than constant intercourse with grown people who\r\nhave passed the imaginative stage, and whose daily duty it is to lay\r\nout ordered knowledge for assimilation by these babes. It is no wonder\r\nthat part of the system should consist of special exercises for the\r\ncultivation of the very faculty which the system as a whole is so\r\nadapted to dull and to weaken. Anything much more silly, however, than\r\nthe method described by Miss Carter it would be difficult to imagine.\r\n\r\nThe great popularity of the kindergarten is due in large measure to\r\nthe fact that it relieves mothers during part of the day of the care\r\nof their small children. That it does this in very many cases at the\r\nexpense of weakening the tie between mother and child there is too\r\nmuch reason to fear. The State has been stepping in more and more\r\nbetween parents and children, until now it lays its hand almost upon\r\nthe cradle. The mothers of the republic are giving way, so far as\r\ninfluence over the rising generation is concerned, to the schoolmarms;\r\nbut it is idle to expect that the latter can take the place of the\r\nmothers we used to know. The kindergarten constitutes a vast extension\r\nof the educational machinery previously in operation, and machinery is\r\nalways impressive, especially to those who do not understand it. What\r\npeople see is that the system works very smoothly and uniformly and\r\nrhythmically, and that it saves, or seems to save, them a great deal\r\nof trouble; and that it is enough to make them think it something very\r\nfine. Whether it is really saving trouble in the end is a question\r\nwhich we consider quite open to discussion. There is room, in our\r\nopinion, to inquire whether the stimulus of society is not too early\r\nand too systematically brought to bear on the infants who throng the\r\neducational nursery--whether it is well for children of three and four\r\nto be brought every day under the eye of, and more or less into\r\ncompetition with, a large number of companions of their own age. We\r\ndoubt much whether it tends to simplicity of character, and we can not\r\nbut regard it as distinctly unfavorable to the development of\r\nindividuality. The rule of fashion begins at once to operate with\r\ngreat intensity, and the child loses the power of conceiving life\r\nexcept in the herd. As to whether trouble on the whole is being saved\r\nto parents by the new system, the question could best be answered by\r\nascertaining whether, in the long run, parents have more or less\r\ntrouble with their children now than formerly. We should be surprised\r\nto hear any one maintaining that they had less.\r\n\r\nWe are aware that parents, for the most part, enthusiastically testify\r\nthat their children enjoy the kindergarten very much; but may it not\r\nbe possible for children, as well as their elders, to like what is not\r\naltogether for their good? We do not consider that we can safely\r\nfollow all a child's likes and dislikes in the matter of diet, or\r\ncompanionship, or hours for going to bed and rising. Sensible people\r\ndo not think that everything children crave should be given to them,\r\nor that more than a limited number of excitements should be thrown in\r\ntheir way. It is one of the drawbacks to wealth that the possessors of\r\nit can hardly refrain from half burying their children beneath a\r\nprofusion of toys, and crowding upon them such a multitude of\r\ndistractions, in the way of travel, shows of all kinds, and society,\r\nthat all chance of development from within is well-nigh destroyed. It\r\nhas been remarked by many that the children of to-day who rarely read\r\na story that is not illustrated, have much less imagination than the\r\nchildren of former days, who in reading had to make and did make their\r\nown mental pictures. Yet what pampered child ever said he or she was\r\npampered too much? What overflattered child ever asked for a surcease\r\nof flattery? What child suffering from an excessive amount of social\r\nexcitement ever requested that it might have less of such unhealthy\r\nstimulation? The inference we draw is that it does not settle the\r\nquestion finally in favor of the kindergarten to say that children\r\nenjoy it. If Miss Carter's experience is to be depended on, the result\r\nat least of some kindergarten training is to stimulate the vanity of\r\nthe little ones and give them a quite undue sense of their\r\nself-importance. They would enjoy that while it lasted, poor little\r\nthings! but it would be a bad preparation for the subsequent work of\r\neducation. One broad fact stares the educational world in the face,\r\nand that is that the average child has to-day, at a given age, a less\r\ncapacity for learning than the average child of twenty-five or thirty\r\nyears ago. What share the kindergarten may have had in this retardment\r\nof intellectual development is a question which deserves\r\ninvestigation. Messrs. McLellan and Dewey, in their work on The\r\nPsychology of Number (International Education Series), say (page 154):\r\n\"We have known the seven-year-old 'head boy' of a kindergarten,\r\nconducted by a noted kindergarten teacher, who could not recognize a\r\nquantity of three things without counting them by ones.... There is\r\nsurely something lacking either in the kindergarten as a preparation\r\nfor the primary school, or in the primary school as a continuation of\r\nthe kindergarten, when a child, after full training in the\r\nkindergarten, together with two years' work in the primary school, is\r\nconsidered able to undertake nothing (in arithmetic) beyond the number\r\ntwenty.\" These authors enter into a very elaborate analysis of the\r\nnumber concept, and lay down with extreme care what they conceive to\r\nbe the best lines of approach to the youthful mind in the teaching of\r\narithmetic. It seems to us, however, that the number concept will dawn\r\nupon the youthful mind without much effort on the part of teachers\r\nwhen the time arrives for it to be of use. In most childish games the\r\nelement of number is involved. The smallest girl with a skipping rope\r\nwill get into the way of counting her skips with a more or less\r\ndistinct conception of the difference between one number and another.\r\nSo in the matter of \"turns\" in any game in which two or more are\r\nengaged: if one child wants to have more \"turns\" than it is entitled\r\nto, the others have to be very young indeed not to protest. In a\r\ntug-of-war with, say, four on each side, the addition of a fifth to\r\none side without permission would make trouble in the camp. When\r\ncandies are being distributed the arithmetical sense is generally\r\nkeenly alive.\r\n\r\nWe conclude by commending Miss Carter's article to the careful\r\nconsideration of all who are interested in educational problems. She\r\nwrites with a certain tinge of vexation, and, without meaning it, may\r\nhave somewhat forced the case against her kindergarten children. The\r\nAtlantic Monthly deserves credit, we must add, for the many able and\r\ntimely articles which it has lately been publishing on educational\r\ntopics--articles stamped by the breadth of thought and high culture\r\nwhich are characteristic of our contemporary, and eminently adapted to\r\nassist in delivering our educational methods from bondage to a\r\nmechanical routine, and bringing them nearer to the simplicity and\r\nfreedom of Nature.\r\n\r\n\r\n_IS FREEDOM LIMITED BY CLIMATE?_\r\n\r\nSince the United States turned its ambition toward the tropics, the\r\nquestion as to whether its political institutions can be extended to\r\nthe inhabitants there has been widely discussed. As might be expected,\r\nthe philanthropic advocates of expansion have insisted that \"the\r\nblessings of freedom and civilization\" are not limited by latitude or\r\nlongitude. Any other position would, of course, have involved them in\r\nthe charge of inconsistency and hypocrisy. But certain philosophic\r\nexpansionists, as they may be politely called, have taken the opposite\r\nview. \"It is a cardinal fact,\" they say, quoting the language of a\r\nrecent essay of Mr. Benjamin Kidd, \"that in the tropics the white man\r\nlives and works only as a diver lives and works under water....\r\nNeither physically, morally, nor politically can he be acclimatized in\r\nthe tropics.\" Still quoting his language, they say again that \"a\r\nclearer insight into the laws that have shaped the course of human\r\nevolution must bring us to see that the process which has gradually\r\ndeveloped the energy, enterprise, and social efficiency of the race\r\nnorthward, and which has left less richly endowed in this respect the\r\npeople inhabiting the regions where the conditions of life are\r\neasiest, is no passing accident, nor the result of circumstances\r\nchangeable at will, but part of the cosmic order of things which we\r\nhave no power to alter.\"\r\n\r\nWhether Mr. Kidd recognizes the odious significance of his captivating\r\nspeculation or not, it is certainly a plea and an apology for slavery\r\nand political despotism in the tropics. Most welcome will it be to all\r\nthose nations and people of easy conscience and measureless greed that\r\nnow hold in bondage of greater or less intensity millions of the\r\ninhabitants of that rich and splendid region. But there is reason to\r\nbelieve that it must be relegated to the limbo of a kindred and\r\npopular superstition. Within the past year much has been said about\r\nthe genius of the Anglo-Saxon for freedom and the ethnic incapacity of\r\nthe Latins for that boon of civilization. Even so great a scholar as\r\nGuizot encourages this extraordinary theory. Again and again does he\r\npoint out in his History of Civilization how the spirit of freedom may\r\nbe traced to the Teutonic hordes that swarmed the forests of Germany.\r\nHe does so despite the overwhelming evidence against him to be found\r\nin his own pages even. In apology for his misinterpretation of social\r\nphenomena there can be urged his ignorance of the law of evolution and\r\nof the hardly less important law of the militant origin of despotism\r\nand the pacific origin of freedom. No such apology can, however, be\r\nmade in behalf of Mr. Kidd, or of any other apostle of imperialism.\r\nNot only have they at command all the generalizations of social\r\nscience, but all the facts upon which those generalizations are based,\r\nto prove that neither climate nor race is a limitation upon freedom.\r\n\r\nIf climate determined the character of the political institutions of a\r\npeople, many questions would be suggested at once that would be beyond\r\nsolution. Why, for instance, should a certain freedom have existed in\r\nAthens, and the most intolerable despotism in Sparta? Again, why\r\nshould there be despotism in Russia and Germany as well as in Morocco\r\nand Egypt? Another series of questions equally perplexing can be\r\nraised. Why should there be more freedom in England to-day than six\r\nhundred or even one hundred years ago? The climate has not changed in\r\nthe interval. Why should the institutions of Spain in the thirteenth\r\ncentury have been more liberal than in the seventeenth? Why was it\r\nthat the freedom that existed in Germany before the Thirty Years' War\r\nhad virtually ceased to exist at the Peace of Westphalia? Here also\r\nthe climate had not changed. Why, finally, was there a reaction toward\r\ndespotism in France after the French Revolution, in Germany after the\r\ndisturbances of 1848, in England after the Crimean War, and in the\r\nUnited States after the rebellion? The only satisfactory answer to\r\nthese questions is to be found in the fact that militant activities\r\nalways lead to despotism, and pacific activities always to freedom.\r\nWhen people get into war, the central power must exercise all the\r\nauthority over life and property essential to success in battle. The\r\nimpulse thus given to despotism spreads to every part of the social\r\nfabric. When people are devoted to the pursuits of peace, the forces\r\nthat make for freedom transform their ideas, feelings, morals, and\r\ninstitutions, political, industrial, and social.\r\n\r\nWhether despotism exists, as Mr. Kidd and his followers assume, among\r\nall the indigenous populations of the tropics, only a careful\r\ninvestigation of the subject would permit one to say. But that it\r\nmust, as they contend, always exist there, none of the laws of social\r\nevolution gives the slightest warrant. Wherever it does exist, it had\r\nthe same origin that it had in England, and in obedience to the same\r\nforces of peace and industry that operated against it in that country,\r\nit must pass away. The struggles between clans and tribes for the\r\npossession of desirable territory, or for the capture of food or\r\nslaves, or for the gratification of predatory and belligerent\r\ninstincts, gave rise to the permanent chief, to the ruling hierarchy,\r\nand to all the other characteristics of a militant society. The degree\r\nof heat or humidity or the luxuriant vegetation of the tropics had no\r\nmore to do with this political organization than the degree of cold,\r\nor the dryness of the atmosphere, or the comparative poverty of the\r\nsoil of some of the Western States with the similar political\r\norganization of the Indians that roamed over them. None of these\r\nphysical characteristics can prevent the play of those forces that\r\ndrive people eventually to the adoption of that form of social\r\norganization that will best promote their happiness. As the social\r\nphilosophy of evolution shows, the social organization best fitted for\r\nthis purpose is the one where the largest individual freedom prevails.\r\nSince the abolition of slavery and serfdom and many other forms of\r\ndespotism has been found necessary for the best interests of society\r\nin Europe, we have a right to believe that the abolition of the same\r\nforms of despotism will be found necessary for the best interests of\r\nsociety in the tropics.\r\n\r\nIt is true that in the tropics the white man has found it\r\nuncomfortable to work, and has often reduced the indigenes to a kind\r\nof slavery. But that either is inevitable and unavoidable because of\r\nthe laws of social evolution, or any more than a temporary reversion,\r\nthere is no reason for holding. Alfred Russel Wallace, who spent\r\ntwelve years in the tropics, says in a recent article that the white\r\nman can and does work in every part of them. If he does not work, it\r\nis simply for the same reason that he does not work in Europe or the\r\nUnited States--namely, because he does not have to. When, however,\r\nnecessity lays its heavy hands on him, driving him to earn his living\r\nby the sweat of his brow, he does it in the tropical region quite as\r\nwell as he does in the temperate. That is shown particularly in\r\nQueensland. But when natives can be reduced to slavery the crime is\r\ncommitted with slight compunction, and defended on the same ground\r\nthat it was defended in the South and elsewhere. The time must come,\r\nhowever, as it came in Brazil and in other countries where slave labor\r\nwas found too wasteful and demoralizing, when it will be displaced\r\nwith free labor. The time must come, too, when free institutions will\r\nbe found as essential under the equator as farther north. Without them\r\nsocial evolution can not reach its highest point, nor man attain to\r\nhis greatest happiness, a state that he is always seeking, no matter\r\nwhere he lives.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nScientific Literature.\r\n\r\n\r\nSPECIAL BOOKS.\r\n\r\nThe famous discovery in Java, by Dubois, of the skullcap, femur, and\r\ntwo teeth in the upper Tertiary rocks has led to many interesting\r\ndiscussions, among which was a paper read by Ernst Haeckel before the\r\nInternational Congress of Zoölogists, held in Cambridge, England, last\r\nyear. In this paper Haeckel contended that in these remains we had at\r\nlast the long-sought-for missing link.[A] This paper excited much\r\ninterest, which led to a request for its publication. The intelligent\r\npublic, without knowing much about the value of the osteological\r\npoints under discussion, were ready to grant that here indeed was the\r\nmissing link, since the highest authorities in science were divided in\r\nopinion as to whether the remains belonged to a very low member of the\r\nhuman race or a very high member of the manlike apes. The conclusion\r\nwould naturally follow that it made but little difference whether the\r\nremains proved to be those of man or monkey, as here was a creature so\r\nintermediate in structure that it stood on the dividing line, so to\r\nspeak. In this little book Haeckel presents the old evidences as to\r\nthe structural similarities between man and the higher apes, and\r\nplaces the Java remains (_Pithicanthropus erectus_) as the last link\r\nin the chain of descent. He also traces the ancestors of the apes\r\nthrough the mammalian series down, step by step, to the lowest\r\nvertebrates, and on through the invertebrates to the lowest forms of\r\nlife. The suggestions are in many cases hypothetical yet instructive,\r\nas showing the possible lines of descent.\r\n\r\nThe unaccountable attitude of the distinguished Virchow in the\r\npresence of these remains is in harmony with his uncompromising and,\r\none might say, unreasoning attitude in regard to the derivative\r\ntheory. Haeckel shows this up very clearly in the following, which we\r\nquote: \"Virchow went to the Leyden Congress with the set purpose of\r\ndisproving that the bones found by Dubois belonged to a creature which\r\nlinked together apes and man. First, he maintained that the skull was\r\nthat of an ape, while the thigh belonged to man. This insinuation was\r\nat once refuted by the expert paleontologists, who declared that\r\nwithout the slightest doubt the bones belonged to one and the same\r\nindividual. Next, Virchow explained that certain exostoses or growths\r\nobservable on the thigh proved its human nature, since only under\r\ncareful treatment the patient could have healed the original injury.\r\nThereupon Professor Marsh, the celebrated paleontologist, exhibited a\r\nnumber of thigh bones of wild monkeys which showed similar exostoses,\r\nand had healed without hospital treatment. As a last argument the\r\nBerlin pathologist declared that the deep constriction behind the\r\nupper margin of the orbits proved that the skull was that of an ape,\r\nas such never occurred in man. It so happened that a few weeks later\r\nProfessor Nehring, of Berlin, demonstrated exactly the same formation\r\non a human prehistoric skull received by him from Santos, in Brazil.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMr. _Russell_ expresses a hope that the review of some of the\r\ncharacteristics of rivers given in one of the chapters of his _Rivers\r\nof North America_[B] may stimulate a desire in American students \"to\r\nknow more of the many and varied charms of their native land.\" The\r\nstudy of rivers is an alluring one, whether pursued upon the little\r\nlocal stream of one's neighborhood or upon the grand rivers that form\r\nsystems and determine geographical districts; whether made with the\r\nassistance of a fishing-rod or of a steamboat. It can not fail to be\r\npromoted by Mr. Russell's instructive book, which the local student or\r\nthe excursionist may consult with profit, while the geographer and\r\ngeologist will find it a convenient manual. A river, when we come to\r\nthink of it, means a great deal. Economically, it is the most valuable\r\ntopographical feature a country can possess; geologically and\r\ngeographically, it is a result of prominent features of the earth's\r\nstructure, and is the cause of modifications in its surface which in\r\ntime may revolutionize the topographical conditions and produce\r\nclimatic and physical changes. All these characteristics of rivers are\r\nsystematically and comprehensively set forth in Mr. Russell's book,\r\nwhere the life-history of the stream is presented, from its beginning\r\nin a little mountain torrent or hillside rill, through its course as\r\nit descends to the plain, wearing and tearing and deepening its\r\nchannel. In the plain its character and action are modified under the\r\nnew conditions in which it finds itself, and gradually, as it\r\napproaches its mouth, it deposits, whereas it had torn away at its\r\nbeginning, and shows contrasts quite as marked as those between youth\r\nand old age. Rivers have their growth in time, too, and a stream that\r\nhas been carrying on its work for long ages presents different\r\ncharacteristics throughout its course from one that comes fresh to its\r\ntask, and these differences are pointed out. We are told, too, how\r\nrivers grow, drawing new affluents to themselves and extending their\r\nsources backward, and how when the sources of streams on different\r\nsides of a watershed approach on the summit, there is a struggle for\r\nthe mastery. These are only a few of the new suggestions which the\r\nbook offers us. Coming to the more matter-of-fact details, the laws\r\ngoverning streams and their course; the influence of inequalities and\r\nthe hardness of rocks, especially on riverside scenery; and the office\r\nof rivers as carriers of material in suspension and in solution, are\r\nconsidered; then their deposits, under various heads and aspects, and\r\nthe effects of changes in the elevation of the land, of variations in\r\nthe load of material and of changes of climate upon them; the origin\r\nand characteristics of stream terraces and stream development, the\r\ntopics concerning which are too many and varied to bear more than a\r\npassing reference. The more salient characteristics of American rivers\r\nare discussed as to the nine drainage slopes--the Atlantic, St.\r\nLawrence, Hudson Bay, Arctic, Bering, Pacific, Great Basin, Gulf, and\r\nCaribbean--each slope presenting its own general characteristics, with\r\nvarieties in detail almost as numerous as the rivers. The whole is\r\nbriefly summarized in the last chapter, The Life History of a River.\r\nWe have given merely the tamest inventory of only a part of the topics\r\nof Mr. Russell's book. As the subject is treated by the author with\r\ncareful attention to specific features, as the magnitude of our river\r\nsystems is indicated, and as rivers with different or contrasting\r\ncharacteristics--the St. Lawrence and the Colorado, for example--are\r\ncompared with one another, the subject takes on an aspect that is\r\nreally grand.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[A] The Last Link.

Price, $2.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENERAL NOTICES.\r\n\r\nAn unfulfilled intention entertained by two successive prosectors of\r\nthe London Zoölogical Society--the late Professor Garrod and the late\r\nW. A. Forbes--of writing a treatise on bird anatomy, is carried out in\r\nthe present work[A] by their successor, _Frank E. Beddard_. Professor\r\nGarrod had nearly completed an account of the Anatomy of the Fowl,\r\nwhich was to be followed by a presentation of the anatomical\r\ncharacters of the different groups. Professor Forbes died before he\r\nwas able to add anything to the manuscripts left by Professor Garrod.\r\nIn the instance of the present work the detailed account of _Gallus_,\r\nwith which Professor Garrod intended to preface his book, has been\r\nrendered unnecessary by Dr. Shufeldt's monograph on the Raven, dealing\r\nwith one particular bird type. Accepting this as a sufficient\r\npresentation of that feature of the subject, Mr. Beddard begins with a\r\ngeneral sketch of bird structure, purposely avoiding histological\r\ndetail and the elaborate description of anatomical facts, which\r\nin the present state of our knowledge are not of great use in\r\nclassification. The main part of the book is the account of the\r\nstructure of the different groups of birds, which is treated of to a\r\nconsiderable extent; and a large number of facts, some of which are\r\nrecorded for the first time, are incorporated in the systematic part\r\nof the book. While all the principal facts pertaining to the subject\r\nare believed to have been given, and nothing of importance to have\r\nbeen left out, references are made in each section to most of the\r\nmemoirs already published. The majority of the facts of bird structure\r\nhave been verified by the author, especially those relating to\r\nosteology and anatomy, and he has drawn liberally on the notebooks of\r\nhis two predecessors. The book gives first an account of the general\r\nstructure of birds; next of the reproductive and renal organs, the\r\ncirculatory, respiratory, and muscular systems, osteology, brain and\r\nnervous system, and affinities of birds, and, finally, the\r\nclassification.\r\n\r\n_Bush Fruits_[B] is the first of a proposed series of monographs on\r\nthe various types of American fruits, to be published under the\r\neditorial direction of Prof. L. H. Bailey. Its purpose is to present\r\nboth the practical and the technical phases of all the important\r\nquestions concerned in the cultivation and domestication of the fruits\r\nthat grow on bushes; and the attempt is made to present these two\r\nsides separate from the details of history, botany, and entomology, so\r\nthat the practical reader may be introduced at once to the information\r\nhe is seeking. The aim is made to treat general truths and principles\r\nrather than mere details of practice, leaving the reader to think out\r\nand solve the local problems for himself. The author, Mr. _F. W.\r\nCard_, who presented the work originally as a Cornell University\r\nthesis, was first a bush-grower, and then a student and teacher,\r\nacquiring first the practice and then the theory. The fruits treated\r\nof are raspberries, blackberries, dewberries, currants, gooseberries,\r\nbuffalo berry, gounie, huckleberries, Juneberries, the cranberry,\r\nbarberry, and sand cherry--all, as to their important types, except\r\nthe currants, evolutions from the species of our own woods. A useful\r\nlist of American books on bush fruits is given in the appendix.\r\n\r\n_The History of the World, from the Earliest Historical Time to the\r\nYear 1898_,[C] is the latest addition to the Concise Knowledge\r\nLibrary, \"a series of volumes on great subjects, containing in an\r\nabridged form a wealth of exact information which can be thoroughly\r\nrelied upon by the student, and yet of such a popular character as to\r\nmeet the needs of the general reader.\" This compact volume of 790\r\npages presents a complete survey of the world's history. After a brief\r\nintroduction describing the various races that have furthered\r\ncivilization, ancient history proper begins with the Egyptians, the\r\npeople of whom we possess the earliest records, and who were the first\r\nto emerge out of the darkness of prehistoric times. Closely connected\r\nwith them, both by racial affinities and political ties, were the\r\nother great empires in the southwestern part of Asia that one after\r\nthe other rose, flourished, and fell into decay. The interesting part\r\nof the book here is the constant reference to the familiar facts of\r\nthe Bible, the connection of the known with the unknown. The rise and\r\ndevelopment of Greece and Rome, following in due course, bring us down\r\nto the middle ages. Mediæval history has for its stage Europe, and for\r\nits argument the upbuilding of the states on which our modern\r\npolitical institutions rest. Modern history, dating from the discovery\r\nof America, then turns the eyes of the nations westward, to found\r\nempires beyond the sea. Nor is the East forgotten. Asia, the cradle of\r\nman, and Africa, where he first rose into consciousness of himself and\r\nrecorded his deeds, again claim the historian's attention. But now it\r\nis China and Japan on the one continent, and the conquests and\r\ncolonies of the Europeans on the other. Neither is the country\r\nyoungest in civilization, Australasia, passed by. And the history of\r\nall these countries, whether east or west, is brought down to date.\r\nEven our recent war with Spain is briefly told. Indeed, the value of\r\nthe book as a work of reference lies in the fact that it encompasses\r\n_all_ the world's history, giving in compact, handy form the chief\r\ndata in the progress of the human race, that otherwise must be sought\r\nfor in a dozen different places. Another valuable feature of the book,\r\nattainable only on the plan of rigid selection of salient points, is\r\nthe connection between the different peoples. Their interdependence,\r\nthe sequence of their appearance on the stage of action, and their\r\ndecline, are most vividly realized in such a bird's-eye view. The book\r\nhas maps and a full index.\r\n\r\nThe essays comprised in Mr. _William M. Bryant's_ volume entitled\r\n_Life, Death, and Immortality, and Kindred Essays_[D] have developed,\r\nas he expresses it, one by one during a number of years past. The term\r\ndeveloped is a happy one, for the papers were certainly not made to\r\norder, but read like results of systematic, continuous thinking. They\r\nconcern the religious aspect of human nature. The author thinks that\r\nnegative criticism has for the time being exhausted its resources, and\r\nthe time has come for further positive interpretation of the\r\nfundamental conceptions of the Christian doctrine as to man's nature\r\nand destiny. A reference to a few of the points in the first essay,\r\nwhich gives the title to the book, will afford a view of the author's\r\nmethod. Men of science are constantly insisting that the total\r\nquantity of energy is changeless, and nothing can be added to it and\r\nnothing taken away. What are the \"total quantity of energy\" and the\r\n\"great first cause\" but the same, to the activity of which is due\r\nevery phase of reality? This being changeless, it could not at some\r\nperiod \"have created a world and afterward left it to spin on of its\r\nown accord 'without interference.'\" Mind is a form of energy,\r\nconsequently indestructible and undying, and the question of\r\nimmortality is reduced to the form \"whether in respect of man's\r\nessential nature as a thinking unit, death can ever be more than\r\ntransition from one to another grade of life.\" Other essays are on\r\nOriental Religions, Church Organization, The Heresy of Non-Progressive\r\nOrthodoxy, Christian Ethics and those of other religions, and\r\nEternity.\r\n\r\nProfessor _Merriman's_ _Elements of Sanitary Engineering_[E] is a\r\nthoroughly practical treatise setting forth the principal rules and\r\nlaws relating to sanitation, both individual and municipal, as it is\r\npracticed to-day. A brief historical introduction is followed by a\r\nclassification of diseases, and a general consideration of such\r\nquestions as filth and disease, impure air and disease, drinking water\r\nand disease, etc. The second chapter takes up the question of the\r\npurification of water. Chapter III discusses the practical aspects,\r\nfor a municipality, of water-supply systems. Consumption of water,\r\ncapacity of storage reservoirs, pipe lines, pumping engines, tanks and\r\nstand pipes and street mains are among the special headings. Sewerage\r\nsystems are next dealt with. A discussion of questions connected with\r\nthe disposal of garbage and sewage forms the fifth and last chapter of\r\nthe book. An item which adds value to the volume is the series of\r\nexercises and problems, practically applying the laws set forth, which\r\nfollows each chapter.\r\n\r\n_An Epitome of Human Histology_[F] has been written by Mr. _Weysse_ to\r\nmeet the difficulty in which the conscientious student of microscopic\r\nanatomy is placed who finds himself in possession of a great many\r\nisolated facts about the minute structure of the body, but with rather\r\nan indefinite conception of the relation of those facts to one another\r\nand of the subject as a whole. In the writing the author has sought to\r\npresent all the facts that are of real importance to the student; to\r\nexpress them in the briefest and clearest language, omitting whatever\r\nis not strictly required; and to arrange them in such a way that the\r\nreader, in considering any organ, may, if he will, actually sketch\r\neach part as he proceeds, and thus make a diagrammatic plan or picture\r\nof the entire structure. The book is not for idle students, but for\r\nserious ones, and it is not a text-book or intended to take the place\r\nof one; and it can serve its true purpose only when used by students\r\nwho have had laboratory practice as well as lectures in histology, and\r\nhave thus examined the actual structures.\r\n\r\nIn his work on _Elementary Botany_,[G] Professor _Atkinson_ introduces\r\nthe method which he has found successful in teaching beginners. Many\r\nof the newer botanical text-books, in reacting against the plan of\r\npresenting first the higher types of plant life, overwhelm the student\r\nnot only with a multitude of unfamiliar forms, but demand from him\r\npowers of comparison and analysis that are generally the result of\r\nmuch scientific discipline. In this book the pupil receives some\r\npreliminary guidance in habits of correct induction. By studying the\r\nprocesses of transpiration, nutrition, growth, and irritability in\r\nplants belonging to higher as well as lower groups, he learns the\r\nuniversality of these life principles, and is led to see the\r\nfoundations for sound generalization. This the author considers vastly\r\nmore important than the knowledge of individual plants. The student,\r\nhowever, in this investigation becomes acquainted with special forms\r\namong the lower plants, and is thus prepared to take up morphology\r\nsystematically. This topic begins with the study of Spirogyra, and\r\nends with an outline of twenty lessons in the angiosperms. The final\r\nthird of the book is devoted to ecology, the study of plants in their\r\nnatural surroundings and of their modifying factors--climate, soil,\r\ntopography, etc. The illustrations, which are above the average\r\nthroughout the work, are in this division exceedingly good. The\r\ndescriptive text of the same section is entertaining enough to be used\r\nas a class reader, and would interest those unfamiliar with botany.\r\nThere are several slight errors to be corrected in a future edition.\r\nIn the table of measures a kilometre is made to equal one hundred\r\ninstead of one thousand metres, and the references to plates are\r\noccasionally wrong. On page 345 the reference should be 449, and on\r\npage 349 should be 458 in place of 457. In describing pollination of\r\nthe skunk cabbage, the words \"rub off\" are ambiguous. The uninitiated\r\nmight suppose that the insect obtained pollen from the stigmas instead\r\nof depositing it there. The book is not intended for recitation, but\r\nfor reference and as a guide in study. It is supplied with an appendix\r\nupon the collection and preservation of material, and an index.\r\n\r\nA notice of a book[H] of this nature is justified in this column,\r\nsince it contains much that will be of interest to the student of\r\nethnology, folklore, and cognate subjects. It is interesting to get a\r\nglimpse of matters pertaining to social customs, ways of thinking, and\r\nthe occurrences which animated these ways among the Japanese a\r\nthousand and more years ago. The author says, \"It is a remarkable and,\r\nI believe, an unexampled fact that a very large and important part of\r\nthe best literature which Japan has produced was written by women.\"\r\n\r\nThe preparation of his _Elementary Text-Book of Botany_[I] was\r\nundertaken by Mr. _Vines_ to meet a demand which appeared to exist for\r\na less bulky and expensive volume than his Students' Text-Book. A more\r\nimportant feature than the diminution of the bulk is claimed in the\r\nsimplification which the contents have undergone from the omission of\r\ncertain difficult and still debatable topics. The usual divisions into\r\nmorphology, anatomy, physiology, and systematic botany are followed;\r\nbut the caution is appended that it must not be forgotten that these\r\nare all parts of one subject, different methods of studying one\r\nobject--the plant. Hence they must be pursued together. \"For instance,\r\nthe morphology of the leaf can not be profitably studied without a\r\nknowledge of its structure and functions; and it is also important to\r\nknow what is the systematic position of each of the various plants\r\nwhose leaves afford the material for study. In a word, the student\r\nshould not attempt to read the book straight through from the\r\nbeginning as if it were a novel. On the contrary, he may begin with\r\nany one of the four parts as his main subject; but that part must be\r\nstudied in close relation with the other three parts\"; and this method\r\nof proceeding is facilitated by the insertion of a large number of\r\ncross-references in the text.\r\n\r\nA satisfactory account is given by _C. Francis Jenkins_ in\r\n_Animated Pictures_[J] of the development and present state of\r\nchronophotography, or the art of \"conveying by persistence of vision a\r\ncounterfeit impression of objects in motion through the display in\r\nrapid succession of a series of related pictures.\" The story shows\r\nvery clearly that this, like most other inventions of consequence, is\r\nno sudden discovery, but is the culmination of a very long series of\r\nexperiments. The principle of it is embodied in the toy, the zoetrope,\r\nthe origin of which is not known, though a citation from Lucretius\r\nindicates that something of the kind existed in his time. With the\r\ndiscovery of instantaneous photography, a new application of the\r\nprinciple of the zoetrope was found. Muybridge and Marey were pioneers\r\nin this development with their photographs of the motions of animals\r\nvaluable in sciences. Since their work was begun the photographic\r\nprocesses and apparatus have been greatly improved. Mr. Jenkins\r\nforecasts a brilliant and useful future for the art, which he hopes\r\nwill be prosecuted along the line of other than its present most\r\npopular uses. The book is practical as well as historical and\r\nprophetic, and contains an account of Mr. Jenkins's phantoscope as the\r\nfirst successful \"moving picture projecting apparatus,\" for which he\r\nreceived the Elliott Cresson medal from the Franklin Institute.\r\n\r\n_The Metric System of Weights and Measures_, prepared by Mr. _A. D.\r\nRisteen_, and published by the Hartford Steam-Boiler Inspection\r\nCompany, Hartford, Connecticut (price, $1.25), gives what has long\r\nbeen wanted--a neat volume, convenient for the pocket and durably\r\nbound, furnishing tables for instantly converting all the metrical\r\nunits up to one hundred of each into those of the English weights and\r\nmeasures, and _vice versa_. Calculation, being needed only for the\r\nnumbers above one hundred, for which there are already short devices,\r\nis reduced to the lowest possible limit.\r\n\r\n_Terrestrial Magnetism_, an international quarterly journal, edited by\r\n_L. A. Bauer_ and _Thomas French, Jr._, and published at the\r\nUniversity of Cincinnati, is the recognized organ of the International\r\nConference on Terrestrial Magnetism and Atmospheric Electricity. The\r\nSeptember number, 1898, contains the proceedings of the conference,\r\nwhich met in connection with the last Bristol meeting of the British\r\nAssociation. It contains in full the welcoming address of Prof. W. E.\r\nAyrton, the opening address of A. W. Rücker, president of the\r\nconference, and ten of the papers read at the meeting.\r\n\r\nThe name of Prof. _John Trowbridge_ as author of such a book as\r\n_Philip's Experiments; or, Physical Science at Home_ (D. Appleton and\r\nCompany, $1) is a sure guarantee of its scientific value. The author\r\nhas given a chapter substantially out of his own experience, for he\r\nsays his taste for science and for drawing were stimulated by his\r\nfather in the manner here described. His object in publishing it is\r\n\"to show that a few moments devoted each day at home to simple\r\ninvestigations can result in habits of self-reliance in the\r\nacquirement of a modern language and in the study of the art of\r\ndrawing.\" He endeavors also to show how to cultivate a taste for\r\nmathematics by studying practical problems in surveying and in sailing\r\na boat; and how much a parent can accomplish in the formation of a\r\nson's tastes without special knowledge, and without the expenditure of\r\nmuch time and money. The account is in the form of letters from the\r\nfather to a friend, describing his experiments with his son Philip in\r\nthis method of teaching. He has always cultivated fellowship with the\r\nboy; and, finding him inclined to improve and add to the designs on\r\nthe wall-paper, puts objects to be drawn and copied in his way, and\r\ninduces him to go out and draw from Nature. So the boy learns to study\r\nforms and observe. To teach language he gives him regularly the daily\r\nGerman newspaper, to pick out what he can from it, and joins him in\r\nthe sport. In a similar way he introduces Philip to surveying and\r\nphysics, and other branches of science. The plan is a success; Philip\r\nattracts attention by the ingenuity which his training has enabled him\r\nto develop, and going to college is graduated with credit and in\r\npossession of a live as well as a book knowledge of what he has\r\nstudied.\r\n\r\nIn _The Story of the English_ (American Book Company) the more\r\nprominent facts of English history from the beginning to the present\r\ntime are related by _H. A. Guerber_ in simple, brief narratives. A\r\ncommendable feature of the book is the insistence in the preface of\r\nthe essential oneness of the English and American people--an idea that\r\ncan hardly be too sedulously cultivated. The author's principal object\r\nhas been to render pupils so familiar with the prominent characters of\r\nEnglish history that they shall henceforth seem like old\r\nacquaintances, and, in addition, to make the story attractive; but it\r\nis a fact to be regretted that he has regarded the growth of English\r\nlaw and liberty and the changes in religion as too unintelligible and\r\nuninteresting to be more than touched upon \"very briefly and in the\r\nmost simple way.\" The growth of law and liberty are the very things\r\nthat it is most important to fix the attention of children upon, and\r\nit is only because they have suffered comparative neglect in the\r\neducation of teachers in favor of stories of war and intrigue that\r\nthey are not the most intelligible and interesting branch of the\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\nProf. _Francis E. Nipher_, of Washington University, having been\r\ncalled upon to present a paper to an educational convention on the\r\nGreater Efficiency of Science Instruction, undertook to show how such\r\nchanges as were adapted to promote that end might be accomplished\r\nwithout radical departures from present methods; and the _Introduction\r\nto Graphical Algebra_ (Henry Holt & Co., New York, 60 cents) is the\r\nresult of that effort. The author believes that the study of algebra\r\nand geometry as distinct subjects having no relation to each other\r\ngives the pupil a false idea of the intellectual situation of to-day;\r\nthat by injecting here and there into the ordinary instruction in\r\nalgebra such material as is found in his book, new meaning will be\r\ngiven to the operations involved in the solution of equations, and new\r\ninterest in the subject may be aroused; and that as scientific\r\ninvestigators are making much use of other methods than Euclid's,\r\nwhile the study of his geometry should not be banished from our\r\nschools, some of the time given to it might be usefully spent in\r\nelementary analytical geometry or graphical algebra. The treatise is\r\nbrief and convenient in size and composed in clear language.\r\n\r\n_The New Man, a Chronicle of the Modern Time_ (Philadelphia: The\r\nLevytype Company), is a story written by _Ellis Paxson Oberholzer_\r\nwith reference to that expansion of women's education and sphere of\r\naction which is suggested by the phrase \"the new woman.\" In it \"the\r\nnew woman is developed to her logical conclusion, and the new man as\r\nhe must needs become under the reaction of her influence,\" and it\r\ndeals with \"men and women imbued with the modern university spirit,\r\nwhose emotional natures are developed under the scientific impulse of\r\nour time, and whose thoughts and actions reflect that impulse in the\r\nmidst of all the varied realities of our modern life.\"\r\n\r\n_Armageddon_ (Rand, McNally & Co.), to the plot of which the author's\r\nname of _Stanley Waterloo_ seems curiously appropriate, is possibly a\r\nspecimen of a class of literature to which we are likely to be treated\r\nin abundance for a few years to come. The spoliation of the Spanish\r\nEgyptians by the Americans having come to a halt with the gain of\r\nPuerto Rico and the Philippines, the great Anglo-American alliance\r\nenters upon the view and is made a fact, though informally. The two\r\nnations together build the Nicaragua Canal, and are about to celebrate\r\nits completion, when they are anticipated by the precipitation of the\r\nwar of the nations through the simultaneous occurrence of a number of\r\nslight international quarrels in different parts of the world.\r\nGermany, Russia, the Scandinavians, and the Latins are pitted on one\r\nside, and the British and Americans, assisted by the British colonies\r\nand the Japanese, on the other; and the battle of the combined fleets\r\noccurs near the Canaries. The hero of the story has invented an air\r\nship which carries terrible explosives to be dropped from a great\r\nheight into the midst of the enemy. This engine does its work at the\r\ndecisive moment, and then follows the grab game of negotiations, in\r\nwhich might rules, and Germany joins the Anglo-Saxon alliance against\r\nthe rest of the world. Finally, the air-ship engine of destruction has\r\nrendered war henceforth forever impossible.\r\n\r\nMr. _James Reid Cole_, president of a classical and military school at\r\nDallas, Texas, has published under the title of _Miscellany_ what is\r\nsubstantially a picture or transcript of his own life. It contains a\r\nvariety of articles--literary essays, school addresses, and even\r\nschoolboy compositions--the chief interest of which is to the author\r\nand his close friends. Other papers, such as A Bird's-eye View of\r\nJohnston's Surrender, the sketches of the Life of Lieutenant C. C.\r\nCole, the Looking Backward over the course of the author's own life,\r\nand political and legislative speeches may have a more general value\r\nas partial reflections of the times to which they relate, more\r\nintimate than are usually to be derived from ordinary sketches and\r\nhistories.\r\n\r\nThe publications of the _New York Academy of Sciences_ now consist of\r\ntwo series--the _Annals_ (8vo) and the _Memoirs_ (4to). The\r\nTransactions, in which the shorter papers and business reports have\r\nhitherto appeared, are abolished, and the matter appears in the\r\nAnnals. This publication, which was begun in 1824, contains the\r\nscientific contributions and reports of researches, together with the\r\nreports of meetings. The complete volumes will hereafter coincide with\r\nthe calendar year. Vol. X, Nos. 1 to 12, contains three papers by H.\r\nS. Davis and one by Frank Schesinger based on the Rutherfurd\r\nphotographs of the stars; The Nature and Origin of Stipules, by A. A.\r\nTyler, and an examination of the Ascidian Half-Embryo, by H. E.\r\nCrampton, Jr. Vol. XI, Part II, contains the annual address of\r\nretiring President J. J. Stevenson, February 28, 1898, on the Debt of\r\nthe World to Pure Science, and six articles on special subjects in\r\nbiology.\r\n\r\nThe Commissioner of Labor was authorized by Congress in 1895 to make\r\nan investigation, so far as it could be done within the limits of the\r\nregular appropriations to his department, relative to the economic\r\naspects of the liquor traffic. He interpreted such an investigation to\r\ninclude the consideration of monetary conditions; of the agricultural\r\nand other products used in the production of liquors; of the\r\nmanufacture of liquors as a distinct industry; of transportation,\r\nconsumption, and the traffic in them; of the revenue derived from them\r\nand the laws regulating its collection; and of the experience and\r\npractice of employers in relation to the use of intoxicants. In some\r\nof these phases of the subject the facts were not separable from those\r\nrelating to other matters; in others, they were to be found in the\r\nreports of other departments; and original inquiry was necessary only\r\nwith reference to the last three items of the category. The results of\r\nthis inquiry are given in the _Twelfth Annual Report of the\r\nCommissioner of Labor, 1897_, under the heading of _Economic Aspects\r\nof the Liquor Problem_.\r\n\r\n_A New Story of the Stars_ is an essay in which _A. W. Bickerton_,\r\nprofessor of chemistry and physics in Christ Church College, New\r\nZealand, sets forth a theory of the origin of universes or of parts of\r\nuniverses by impact. Nebulæ already existing--but how existing we are\r\nnot informed--careering through space, are supposed to collide,\r\nwhereby heat and light are developed. They may meet in face, and would\r\nthen probably coalesce, but more likely the impact would be a grazing\r\none, when three bodies would be produced; a portion, or slice, as the\r\nauthor calls it, of each of the colliding bodies would be sheared off,\r\nforming an intensely hot and bright new star, while the original\r\nmasses would go on their course, having the parts that had been in\r\ncontact heated and made brilliant, so as to present in their\r\nrevolutions the aspect of variable stars. The author's attention was\r\ndrawn to this subject by the appearance of a new star in Cygnus in\r\n1877. A little while afterward Nova Aurigæ appeared, presenting\r\nexactly the phenomena he had predicted. Professor Bickerton writes as\r\none who understands his subject; there is nothing in his speculations,\r\nso far as we have observed, that grates harshly with known facts, and\r\nit can be read, as he reads it, to account plausibly for some of the\r\nfacts--just as can several other theories of the formation of the\r\nuniverse which are still only speculations. The problem is yet far\r\nfrom comprehension, and is one of the legacies which the nineteenth\r\ncentury is destined to bequeath to the twentieth.

Marsh, professor of\r\npaleontology in Yale University, and curator of the geological\r\ncollection of that institution, died of pneumonia at his home in New\r\nHaven, Connecticut, March 18th. He had not been in good health for\r\nseveral years, and succumbed to the effects of a cold which he had\r\ncaught before wholly recovering from a previous cold. A sketch of his\r\nlife up to that time, embracing the most active parts of his career as\r\na geological explorer, in which he gained great renown, was given,\r\nwith a portrait, in the Popular Science Monthly for September, 1878.\r\nDuring the period that has intervened he made studies of the results\r\nof his explorations and other geological work, and published papers of\r\nvery high scientific value. About a year ago he transferred his\r\nextensive and famous collections at the Peabody Museum to the\r\nuniversity. These collections were among the finest of their kind in\r\nthe world, and were especially remarkable for their fossils of immense\r\nanimals exhumed from the Western plains. They were greatly admired by\r\nProfessor Gaudry, the eminent French geologist, who spoke of them in\r\nterms of high praise in the _Revue des Deux Mondes_ of October 15,\r\n1898. It was through his efforts that the funds were obtained from\r\nGeorge Peabody, his uncle, for the construction of the Peabody Museum,\r\na part of which has been built. His health having apparently improved\r\nfor a few months previous to his death, he had been working with\r\nrenewed activity at the museum, and had recently written articles on\r\npaleontological subjects. Having considerable means of his own, he\r\nserved the university without salary, and carried on his explorations\r\nmostly at his own cost, paying large sums to assistants and for other\r\nitems in the work. He left ten thousand dollars to the National\r\nAcademy of Sciences, of which he was one of the founders and was for\r\nseveral years president, and all of the rest of his estate, estimated\r\nto be worth nearly one hundred thousand dollars, to Yale University.\r\n\r\n=Popular Co-operation in Health Work.=--In a review of A Quarter\r\nCentury of Public Health Work in Michigan, Mr. Theodore R. MacClure,\r\nchief clerk of the State Board of Health office, says that experience\r\nin the State has indicated that it is necessary to have the\r\nco-operation of the people if the dangerous communicable diseases are\r\nto be restricted and prevented. In order to accomplish this result,\r\nthe State Board of Health has published leaflets relating to the modes\r\nof spreading and the best methods for the restriction and prevention\r\nof such diseases. These leaflets have been printed by tens of\r\nthousands, and whenever a dangerous disease is reported to the central\r\noffice several copies of the leaflet relating to the disease in\r\nquestion are usually sent to the local health officer. He is requested\r\nto place one of these instructive publications with the family where\r\nthe disease exists, and a copy with each neighbor of the infected\r\npremises. The instruction comes at a time when people are interested\r\nto know about the disease in question, and in this way their general\r\nco-operation is sought and secured. Citizens are thus educated and\r\nbecome familiar with their duties in the premises, are taught wherein\r\nthe dangers lie and how to avoid them, and are prompted by the\r\nstrongest considerations to do their part in the matter.\r\n\r\n=Death of Prof. Oliver Marcy.=--Dr. Oliver Marcy, professor of natural\r\nscience in Northwestern University, who died February 19th, in the\r\neightieth year of his age, was a native of Coleraine, Massachusetts;\r\nwas graduated from Wesleyan University in 1846, became teacher of\r\nmathematics in Wilbraham Academy, Massachusetts, and later professor\r\nof geology, etc., in that institution. In 1862 he was appointed\r\nprofessor of geology in Northwestern University, Evanston, Illinois,\r\nbut taught in addition, at times, other branches of science and even\r\nsome branches in other lines. He was twice acting president of the\r\nuniversity. In conjunction with Prof. Alexander Winchell, he prepared\r\na monograph on Fossils from the Niagara Limestone of Chicago, which\r\nwas read to the Boston Society of Natural History. In 1866 he was\r\nnaturalist to a Government expedition to the Bitter Root Mountains in\r\nIdaho and Montana, in which he collected scientific material, and of\r\nwhich he published an account in 1867. He wrote papers concerning the\r\ngeology of the shore of Lake Michigan and of the region about Chicago;\r\nbrought two fossil trees found in the university grounds to scientific\r\nnotice; and contributed considerably to geological publications. He\r\nwas curator to the natural history collection of his university for\r\nnearly thirty years. Two fossil species and a mountain in Montana have\r\nbeen named after him.\r\n\r\n=Which is the Fittest to Survive?=--Prof. A. W. Rücker spoke in his\r\nopening address at the recent meeting of the International Magnetic\r\nConference in Bristol, England, of what seems to be a law of Nature,\r\nthat the products of an organism are fatal to itself; in accordance\r\nwith which, he said, pure science is threatened by the very success of\r\nits practical applications. The smoke of our cities blots the stars\r\nfrom the vision of the astronomer, and now the science of terrestrial\r\nmagnetism is threatened by the artificial earth currents of the\r\nelectric railway. Prof. W. E. Ayrton, in his welcoming address, took\r\nanother view of the subject and answered the reference the electrical\r\nengineers make to the principle of the survival of the fittest when\r\nthey are told of the ruin their wires are bringing upon magnetic\r\nobservatories--\"So much the worse for the observatories\"--\"Can the\r\nsystem of electric traction that has already destroyed the two most\r\nimportant magnetic observatories in the United States and British\r\nNorth America be the best and fittest to survive? Again, do we take\r\nsuch care and spend such vast sums in tending the weak and nursing the\r\nsick because we are convinced that they are the fittest to survive?\r\nMay it not be perhaps because we have an inherent doubt about the\r\njustice of the survival of the strongest, or perhaps because even the\r\nstrongest of us feels compelled modestly to confess his inability to\r\npick out the fittest, that modern civilization encourages, _not_ the\r\ndestruction but the preservation of what has obvious weakness, on the\r\nchance that it may have unseen strength? When the electrical engineer\r\nfeels himself full of pride at the greatness, the importance, and the\r\npower of his industry, and when he is inclined to think slightingly of\r\nthe deflection of a little magnet compared with the whirl of his\r\none-thousand-horse-power dynamo, let him go and visit a certain dark\r\nstoreroom near the entrance hall of the Royal Institution, and while\r\nhe looks at some little coils there, ponder on the blaze of light\r\nthat has been shed over the whole world from the dimly lighted\r\ncupboard in which these coils now lie. Then he may realize that while\r\nthe earth as a magnet has endured for all time, the earth as a tramway\r\nconductor may at no distant date be relegated to the class of\r\ntemporary makeshifts, and that the raids of the feudal baron into the\r\nagricultural fields of his neighbors were not more barbarous than the\r\nalarms and excursions of the tramway engineer into the magnetic fields\r\nof his friends.\"\r\n\r\n=Teaching the Teachers.=--The following suggestive paragraph is taken\r\nfrom the inaugural address of William Henry Preece, president of the\r\nBritish Institution of Civil Engineers: \"Our educational methods have\r\nbegun at the wrong end. We ought to teach the masters first and then\r\nthe men. Moreover, we have to teach the teachers and those who have\r\ncontrol of the purse-strings. The County Councils of England are\r\nscarcely qualified as yet to discharge the very serious duty of\r\nproperly dealing with a question so few of them understand--though\r\nmany of them have tackled the matter manfully, especially the London\r\nCounty Council, through its Technical Education Board, on which a\r\nlarge proportion of co-opted experts have seats, who, by supporting\r\nexisting institutions, have contributed toward the supply of teachers.\r\nBut how are we to approach the masters? A fault once discovered is\r\nhalfway to repair. It is difficult to remove the scales from the eyes\r\nof the man who has been successful in business and knows not of his\r\nblindness; but the coming generation will be more enlightened, and the\r\nfuture masters better educated. We are suffering from a lack of\r\ncompetent teachers. A teacher who has had no training in the practical\r\nworld is worse than useless, for he imparts ideas derived from his\r\ninner consciousness or from the false teaching of his own abstract\r\nprofessor, which lead to mischief. In my own experience I have met\r\nwith very serious inconveniences from this cause. The ideal professor\r\nof pure abstract science is a very charming personage, but he is a\r\nvery arrogant and dogmatic individual, and, being a sort of little\r\nmonarch in his own laboratory and lecture room, surrounded by devoted\r\nsubjects, his word is law, and he regards the world at large,\r\nespecially the practical world, as outside his domain and beneath his\r\nnotice. He is generally behind the age. These are not the men for\r\ntechnical institutes. Such teachers should possess the diploma of this\r\ninstitution.\"\r\n\r\n=The People of India and the Missionaries.=--In the light of three\r\nmonths' special observation, J. T. Sunderland has reviewed in the New\r\nWorld Magazine the prospects of the success of Christian missions in\r\nIndia. There are several causes that hinder their progress, among\r\nwhich the author mentions as more important the number of Christian\r\nsects and denominations; the character of the doctrines preached, in\r\nthat in many aspects they do not appeal to Hindu or Mohammedan faith\r\nor modes of thought, and in some contradict them, and as to those\r\npoints are a serious hindrance to the progress of Christianity; and\r\nthe vices of many Europeans, creating a prejudice against their\r\nprofessed religion that is not wholly contradicted by the testimonies\r\nand examples of the missionaries and men of nobler stamp. To the last\r\nobjection the answer is easy, though it may not always be convincing,\r\nthat these wicked men sin not because they are natural products of\r\nChristianity, but because they disobey it. A strong factor in\r\ndisarming prejudice against Christianity and winning favor for it is\r\nthe fact that through it, directly or indirectly, certain very\r\nimportant kinds of good are coming to India--education, schools,\r\nbooks, science, invention. The contact of India with Christian lands,\r\ncivilization, thought, and life, is steadily telling upon Indian\r\nthought. Further, \"it is to be said to the honor of all the Protestant\r\nmissions of India, at least, of whatever name, that they are helping,\r\ninstructing, and lifting up the lower classes, and offering them hopes\r\nand prospects such as they could not have had under their old faiths.\r\nThis is much, very much.\" The very presence of the missionary in a\r\ncommunity is likely to be an enlightening influence. He is a man of\r\nmore than common education, and \"has brought with him to India\r\nsomething of the thought, the culture, the ideals of life, the habits\r\nand customs of the Western world. He introduces higher standards of\r\nliving. He gives his influence in favor of better public sanitation,\r\nbetter homes for the people, better streets and public buildings,\r\nbetter public improvements generally. His home and family life, in\r\nwhich the wife receives the same consideration as her husband, and the\r\ndaughters are educated with the same care as the sons, becomes a\r\nvaluable object lesson in the community where he dwells.\" The missions\r\nas a whole are regarded by the author as an important factor in a\r\ngreat religious evolution. The precise form and direction which this\r\nevolution will take seem to be a matter yet to be determined.\r\n\r\n=Weeds under Cultivation.=--For several years past the botanical\r\ndepartment of Michigan Agricultural College has maintained a \"weed\r\ngarden,\" and has grown a hundred or more species of the most\r\ntroublesome weeds in plots. Some curious results from the experiments\r\nare recorded by Prof. W. J. Beal in a paper read at the meeting, 1897,\r\nof the Society for the Promotion of Agricultural Science. The most\r\nvigorous and aggressive weeds seem to take on under cultivation the\r\nweakness and capriciousness of delicate cultivated plants. \"It is very\r\ninstructive,\" Professor Beal says, \"to note how much better many of\r\nthese plants thrive when they get away from the spot where they have\r\nbeen confined for from two to several years. Seedlings of Jamestown\r\nweed were larger in the plantain bed than in their own. After three\r\nyears the plantain nearly ran out and _Amaranthus albus_ entirely\r\ndisappeared. One species of pigweed grew finely for two years, but\r\nafterward made a small display; and another variety did not seem very\r\npersistent for a plant that ranked among the weeds, but shied off from\r\nits home ground 'as if searching for fresh fields.' Barnyard grass\r\n(_Panicum crusgalli_) behaved like pigweed, and 'needed considerable\r\nattention.' The little round-leaved mallow, which roots deeply about\r\nrubbish piles in mellow soil, was grown of respectable proportions in\r\nthe garden with considerable difficulty, and with no more ease in the\r\nbottom lands of other parts of the botanic garden. Considerable pains\r\nis required every year to keep on hand even fairly well-grown\r\nspecimens of mullein. Knotgrass, which thrives with abuse and seems to\r\nenjoy trampling by feet, was grown with difficulty in the plots.\r\n'Insects prey upon it; rust causes it to dwindle and disappear.'\r\n'Motherwort grows rank four feet high near the barnyard fence, and the\r\nflowers are covered with bees, but when kept several years in the same\r\nbed it goes off into the sulks as though neglected.' Shepherd's purse\r\nis often disturbed by a parasitic fungus, and it is difficult to grow\r\nnice plants long in the same place. Cocklebur, if found long in the\r\nsame spot, is troubled sadly with a mildew, and more recently also\r\nwith a rust.\"\r\n\r\n=Operations against Woodchucks.=--Prof. F. H. Storer records in the\r\nBulletin of the Bussey Institution, Harvard University, the results of\r\nhis experiments in the destruction of woodchucks, which, besides being\r\nvery injurious to lands he had under cultivation, appeared to be\r\nincreasing. Smothering by a volatile liquid driven into the burrow has\r\nbeen suggested by Professor Hilgard, who recommends bisulphide of\r\ncarbon. Professor Bussey finds that liquid not wholly satisfactory and\r\nliable to objections, and prefers a preparation of naphtha or other\r\nvolatile liquid. In any event, some device seems to be needed for\r\nforcing a considerable quantity of the vapor into the very end of the\r\nburrow. Poisons are dangerous because of the probability that the\r\nanimal would bring the food on which they are placed to the mouth of\r\nthe burrow for eating, where children or useful animals might get it.\r\nWhile experimenting with burning Cayenne pepper or sulphur on touch\r\npaper, in order to smoke out the burrows, the author became acquainted\r\nwith the \"woodchuck torches\" of Mr. B. M. Wedger, of Roslindale,\r\nMassachusetts. These consist of nitrate of soda, sulphur, mealed\r\ngunpowder, and sulphide of antimony, so packed into a tube like a\r\nRoman candle that on burning the fuse the vapors would be forced by\r\ngreat pressure to the farthest recesses of the burrow. They proved\r\neffectual, and it was indeed rare that any woodchuck to which they\r\nwere applied ever reported himself again. Professor Storer also\r\ndescribes some experiments he made in burning sulphur in the burrows,\r\nwith special expedients for insuring more rapid and perfect combustion\r\nof the sulphur; these promised fairly well. Mr. Henry Stewart has\r\ndescribed in the Country Gentleman an effectual method of destroying\r\nwoodchucks with blasting powder or dynamite.\r\n\r\n=Evolution in Lamps.=--The story of lamps from Herodotus down to 1830,\r\nMr. Henry C. Mercer says, in an instructive study on Light and Light\r\nMaking in the contributions of the Bucks County (Pa.) Historical\r\nSociety, is not one of development. In principle and form they remain\r\nthe same, whether as the tin cylindrical or boat-shaped cups on\r\ncandlestick pedestals and the round tin cups with hemispherical lids,\r\nor the lidless cups resting on wooden stands such as were recently\r\nrescued by the author from the garret rubbish of old Bucks County. And\r\nbefore Herodotus, as we follow the lamp back into the tombs of the Old\r\nWorld, we find the boat-shaped form of earthenware preceding the\r\nboat-shaped form of iron and possibly even that of bronze. The\r\nchalk-cup lamp found by Canon Greenwell in the neolithic flint mines\r\nat Grimes Graves, England, perhaps the oldest wick-floating lamp in\r\nthe world, is not essentially different from the oyster shell filled\r\nwith lard and provided with wicks that may be found among Virginia\r\nnegroes to-day. The Egyptian, Grecian, Phoenician, and Roman lamps, as\r\nthey have been found in the tombs and as we see them in the museums,\r\nare not unlike the lard lamps that were most in use early in the\r\nnineteenth century. Then crude grease gave way to sperm oil and lard\r\noil, with especial adaptations of the lamps that made them more\r\nconvenient and improved the light; and burning fluids that were\r\nconvenient and clean and gave a brilliant light, but were dangerous;\r\nand kerosene, with other improvements in the lamps and refinements in\r\nthe oil that enabled it to give the most perfect artificial light yet\r\nfound and to keep up the fight for quality with gas and\r\nelectricity--all these having come in within the life-time of men\r\nstill among us. Besides the old lamps, our ancestors had candles,\r\nmolded when the price of tin, the material for the molds, did not\r\nforbid the luxury, and before them tallow dips; a suspended wick was\r\ndipped into a pot of hot tallow, on a cold day, and the operation was\r\nrepeated till layer after layer of grease hardened, and the candle was\r\nthick enough. These candles were, however, troublesome in hot weather,\r\non account of their propensity to yield to the temperature and fall\r\nover. \"Who shall say, however, that candle-dipping is older than\r\nmolding, when we know ... that they molded candles in County Galway,\r\nIreland, in late years by punching holes in peat and pouring in tallow\r\non the down-hung wick of twisted flax fiber?\" The Irish had, too, as\r\nhad the negroes, the rush light, a greased rush set in a hole in a\r\nwooden block serving as a candlestick; or rushes joined in a triple\r\ntwist which flies apart when lighted, increasing the blaze. From this\r\nMr. Mercer passes to forms of candlesticks and torches and cressets\r\nand methods of producing fire, whither we can not follow him, for the\r\nmultitude of details he notices, which will not bear abstracting.\r\n\r\n=Inconsistent Philozoists.=--In his address at the opening of the\r\nphysiological and pathological laboratories at Belfast, Ireland, Lord\r\nLister took occasion to give some illustrations, drawn from practice,\r\nof the value of pathological research. \"There are people,\" he said,\r\n\"who do not object to eating a mutton chop--people who do not even\r\nobject to shooting a pheasant with a considerable chance that it may\r\nbe only wounded and may have to die after lingering in pain, unable to\r\nobtain its proper nutriment--and yet who consider it something\r\nmonstrous to introduce under the skin of a guinea-pig a little\r\ninoculation of some microbe to ascertain its action. These seem to me\r\nto be most inconsistent views. If these experiments upon the lower\r\nanimals were made for the mere sport of the thing, they would be\r\nindeed to be deprecated and decried; but if they are made with the\r\nwholly noble object of not only increasing human knowledge, but also\r\nof diminishing human suffering, then I hold that such investigations\r\nare deserving of all praise. Those little know who lightly speak on\r\nthese matters how much self-denial is required in the prosecution of\r\nsuch researches when they are conducted, as indeed they always are, as\r\nfar as I am aware, with the object of establishing new truth.\"\r\n\r\n=The Ruins of Xkichmook, Yucatan.=--The group of ruins in Yucatan\r\ncalled Xkichmook was discovered by Mr. Edward H. Thompson in 1888,\r\nwhen he read a paper before the American Antiquarian Society embodying\r\nhis first impressions of it. He has since made studies of it extending\r\nover a period of seven years. The group is about one hundred and forty\r\nmiles south of Merida and forty or fifty miles east of Campeche,\r\nsituated in a narrow valley between a series of rocky hills, and has\r\nto be approached by precipitous paths over the hillsides, and thence\r\ndown the beds of dry _arroyos_ whose yearly freshets wash away all\r\nvegetation. Ten buildings, including one called the Palace, and two\r\nmounds were explored, and some miscellaneous excavations were\r\nmade--all of which are described in the author's paper (Field\r\nColumbian Museum), with figures of the buildings and objects. Pottery\r\nand flaked stone implements were plentiful, but polished implements\r\nand specimens of sculpture were exceedingly rare. The flat under\r\nsurfaces of the ceiling stones of the vaulted chambers seem to have\r\ncontained very elaborate designs; in another chamber portions of a\r\npainting were still partly preserved; in another, curious drawings or\r\nglyphs in strong black lines once existed; in another was a painted\r\nhuman figure, of which only the flowing headdress, a portion of the\r\nface, and certain devices issuing from the mouth and probably\r\nindicating speech, now remain. The mysterious red hand was found\r\npainted in various places, and in one a human hand in blue pigment was\r\nfound, the impression of which was so fresh and perfect in places that\r\neven the minute lines of the skin were visible. In ten years of\r\ninvestigation among the ruins of Yucatan and Campeche not as many\r\nspecimens of worked obsidian were found as could be picked up in half\r\nan hour among certain Mexican ruins; but traces of ancient fabrication\r\nof flint implements were more plentiful than anywhere else.\r\n\r\n=The Seventeen-Year and the Thirteen-Year Locusts.=--The periodical\r\ncicada, or seventeen-year locust, as it is called, is distinctly\r\nAmerican, and has the longest life period of any known insect. It is\r\nespecially remarkable, Mr. C. L. Marlatt observes in his memoir upon\r\nit, in its adolescent period, the features of particular divergence\r\nfrom other insects being its long subterranean life of thirteen or\r\nseventeen years, and the perfect regularity with which at the end of\r\nthese periods every generation, though numbering millions of\r\nindividuals, attains maturity almost at the same moment. At this\r\nmoment the brood issue from the ground, leaving innumerable exit\r\nholes, and swarm over trees and shrubs, filling the air with their\r\nstrident calls, and laying their eggs in slits which they cut in the\r\ntrees. The larvæ, when hatched, fall to the ground, and quickly burrow\r\nout of sight, each \"forming for itself a little subterranean chamber\r\nover some rootlet, where it remains through winter and summer, buried\r\nfrom sun, light, and air, and protected in a manner from cold and\r\nfrost.... It lives thus alone in its moist earthen chamber,\" rarely\r\nchanging its position unless some accident to the nourishing rootlet\r\nmay necessitate its seeking another, passing the thirteen or seventeen\r\nyears of its hypogeal existence in slow growth and preparation for a\r\nfew weeks only of winged life in the air and light. Other cicadas\r\nappear every year, usually in comparatively small numbers. They are\r\nprobably equally long in maturing, but the periods of their lives have\r\nfrom some cause or another been cast in \"off\" years. The thirteen-year\r\nbroods are southern, and the shortening of their periods of\r\ndevelopment may possibly be accounted for by the longer season of\r\nwarmth in the southern year giving them the number of hours or of\r\naggregate degrees of warmth in thirteen years that the more northern\r\nbroods can not receive in less than seventeen years. This, however, is\r\nonly speculation, and there are difficulties in applying the\r\nsupposition to make it fit all the facts; and many believe that the\r\ntwo races are specifically different. The late Prof. Charles V. Riley\r\ndistinguished twenty-two different broods of cicadas in the United\r\nStates, seven of which appertain to the thirteen-year period (_Cicada\r\ntredecem_).\r\n\r\n\r\nMINOR PARAGRAPHS.\r\n\r\nThe Bureau of Nature Study of Cornell University is making a\r\npraiseworthy effort to interest children in caring for birds, or, as\r\nits circular has it, treating them as \"summer boarders.\" It publishes\r\na leaflet entitled The Birds and I, which it sends free to teachers\r\nwho ask for it and who will give it to their pupils. It has pictures\r\nof various styles of bird houses, which may serve as patterns for the\r\nconstruction of homes for the summer guests. \"The kind of birds,\" the\r\ninteresting circular of the bureau says, \"that will set up\r\nhousekeeping in the homes that you provide will harm no one. They are\r\nnever cross, never throw stones or rob us, but are always happy and\r\nhave cheerful songs. We are always kind to people having such\r\ndispositions, and why should we not be so to birds as well?\" The\r\nbureau invites correspondence from boys and girls disposed to\r\nentertain birds.\r\n\r\nThe National Geographic Society offers prizes of one hundred and fifty\r\ndollars and seventy-five dollars severally for the first and second\r\nbest essays relating to pre-Columbian discoveries and settlements of\r\nthe Norsemen on the mainland of North America, and the location of the\r\nlands mentioned in the Icelandic Sagas, the competition to close\r\nDecember 31, 1899. The essays sent in should be typewritten in the\r\nEnglish language, not exceeding six thousand words in length, and may\r\nbe accompanied by maps and illustrations for explanation of the text,\r\nbut not for embellishment. The committee of awards consists of Mr.\r\nHenry Gannett, Prof. Albert Bushnell Hart, Mrs. Anita Newcomb McGee,\r\nProf. John Bach McMaster, and Coast Survey Superintendent Henry S.\r\nPritchet.\r\n\r\nExperiments by a German naturalist, Herr Albrecht Bethe, summarized in\r\nthe _Revue Scientifique_, upon recognition of one another by ants,\r\nconfirm the opinions of Lubbock, McCook, Forel, and others that they\r\nare guided by the sense of smell. Herr Bethe found that an ant\r\n\"whitewashed\" with liquid of ants of its own nest was well received by\r\nits fellows when it went among them; but when the liquid of ants of a\r\ndifferent nest was applied it was attacked at once. An ant washed with\r\nalcohol, next with water, and then with the liquid of a strange\r\nspecies was well received in a nest of that species, although it was\r\nmuch smaller than any of the individuals composing it. Another ant\r\nwashed with alcohol and water, dried, and immediately returned to its\r\nfellows of its own nest, was attacked by them; but when kept for\r\ntwenty-four hours after drying, or long enough to recruit itself, was\r\nreceived by them.\r\n\r\nThe following tables are taken from a paper by Dr. J. Richardson\r\nArmstrong in a recent Lancet, describing his experience with\r\ndiphtheria antitoxine in private practice in treating one hundred and\r\ntwenty-two cases of diphtheria:\r\n\r\n  ------------------------+------+----------+--------\r\n                          |      |Recovered.|  Died.\r\n  ------------------------+------+----------+--------\r\n            1.            |      |          |\r\n  Total number of cases   |      |          |\r\n    treated from June     |      |          |\r\n    21 to Dec. 17, 1897   |  42  |    36    |    6\r\n  Severe cases; antitoxine|      |          |\r\n    injected              |  22  |    20    |    2\r\n  Mild cases; antitoxine  |      |          |\r\n    not injected          |  20  |    16    |    4\r\n                          +======+==========+========\r\n            2.            |      |          |\r\n  Total number of cases   |      |          |\r\n    treated, January 1    |      |          |\r\n    to December 31,       |      |          |\r\n    1898                  |  80  |    77    |    3\r\n  Severe cases, injected  |  55  |    54    |    1\r\n  Mild cases, non-injected|  25  |    23    |    2\r\n  ------------------------+------+----------+--------\r\n\r\nIn answer to the question, Should every case of diphtheria be treated\r\nwith antitoxine, Dr. Armstrong says: \"Some of the cases are\r\nsufficiently mild not to need it, so I will not go so far as to say\r\nthat it is absolutely essential to inject in every case, although I\r\nwould call it an excellent practice to do so, and the patients would\r\nmake much more rapid recoveries. I think that injection ought to be\r\ninsisted upon as early as possible in every case that is at all severe\r\nor likely to prove so, and I think that the medical man who does not\r\nemploy antitoxine and who loses a large proportion of his cases is\r\nincurring a responsibility which is almost criminal. The earlier a\r\npatient is injected the greater is the chance of recovery, and the\r\nmore rapid is the recovery.\"\r\n\r\nAmong the leading principles of forestry, as defined by the chief fire\r\nwarden of Minnesota, are that the best agricultural land should not be\r\ndevoted to forest while wood and timber can be profitably grown on\r\nsoil that is unfit for farming purposes; that the management should be\r\ncontinuous, and no more timber should be taken out of the forest in\r\none year, or in a series of ten or twenty years, than grows in the\r\nentire forest in the same period; that the cutting of timber should be\r\nin blocks or strips, so as to facilitate reproduction on the clear\r\nareas by seeds falling from the trees left standing; and that the\r\nforest, when young, must have in numbers vastly more trees than when\r\nit is mature. To make good timber, the forest, when young, must be\r\ncrowded so as to secure height growth. Mixed wood, managed on forestry\r\nprinciples in the Black Forest of Germany, has per acre, at the age of\r\ntwenty years, 3,960 trees; at the age of one hundred years, 262 trees.\r\n\r\nA new process for the production of a textile material is thus\r\ndescribed in Industries and Iron: \"It consists of 'squirting,' in a\r\nfashion similar to that of making electric incandescent carbons, pure\r\ngelatin in threads of about one thousandth part of an inch in\r\ndiameter, the thread being taken away on revolving tapes. The threads\r\nare wound upon reels and exposed to formalin vapor, which exercises a\r\nmost remarkable effect on the gelatin, rendering it insoluble in any\r\nmedium yet applied to it. The tensile qualities of the thread are also\r\nincreased, while, in opposition to that produced under the Lehner\r\nprocess (which is simply forming nitrated cellulose into threads for\r\nweaving), it is capable of taking up any dye desired; and it is, of\r\ncourse, impervious to any hygroscopic influence.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES.\r\n\r\nProf. E. C. Pickering, of the Harvard College Observatory, announces\r\nthe discovery by Mrs. Fleming of a new variable star in Sagittarius.\r\nIt was found on eight of the photographs in her large collection. On\r\nMarch 8, 1898, it was of the fifth magnitude, and on April 29, 1898,\r\nof the eighth magnitude. A plate taken on March 9, 1899, shows it\r\nstill visible and of the tenth magnitude. Its spectrum resembles that\r\nof other new stars. The entire number of new stars discovered since\r\n1885 is six, of which five have been found by Mrs. Fleming.\r\n\r\nBecause of the great loss by fire which occurs every year in the\r\nRussian villages, the government is making efforts to induce the\r\npeasantry, says the _Saturday Review_, to employ some less dangerous\r\nmaterial than straw thatch for the roofing of their _izbas_. There has\r\nalready been a large increase in the use of shingle, and this has led\r\nto a considerable importation from Belgium and Germany, and also from\r\nthe United States, of simple and inexpensive shingle making machines,\r\nfor use in rural districts. German manufacturers, whose \"commercial\r\nintelligence department\" is remarkably well informed, are now making\r\nredoubled efforts to meet the immense demand anticipated. An improved\r\nand inexpensive hand fire engine is also being provided. Roofing felt\r\nor paper is very generally used under the shingle, and the demand for\r\nthis is also increasing.\r\n\r\nA fourth specimen of the _Notornis Mantelli_, a bird of New Zealand\r\nsupposed to have become extinct, was captured in August last, and has\r\nbeen prepared for the museum by Mr. W. B. Benham. The first specimen\r\nwas obtained, recently slain, by Mr. W. Mantell, in 1849, and is\r\npreserved in the British Museum; the second was killed by Maoris in\r\n1851, and is in the Colonial Collection; and the third, now in the\r\nDresden Museum, was taken in 1879. All these birds were found in a\r\nsingle denuded region of the country. The present specimen was caught\r\nby a dog in the bushes near Lake Te Anan, still in the same region,\r\nand is a very fine young female.\r\n\r\nA plant growing in the dense jungles of Langsuam, Siam, was described\r\nby H. Warington Smyth, in an address to the Royal Geographical\r\nSociety, as having the property of setting up a great irritation in\r\nthe skin of any person coming in contact with it. \"It has a large,\r\nbroad leaf, and the Siamese declare that, after being badly stung by\r\nit, the only remedy is the heat of a fire; to bathe in a stream, which\r\nis the natural impulse, is considered absolutely fatal. A spot on the\r\nKra-Champawn trail is known as _Burmatai_, from the fact that a party\r\nof Burmese, coming across to harry their neighbors in the old fighting\r\ndays, are said to have got into a thick growth of this plant, and to\r\nhave bathed in the stream to allay the agony, with the result that\r\nthey all died there.\" The Siamese call the plant _kalang-ton chang_.\r\n\r\nIn the western part of Belgium the dog has been employed as a beast of\r\nburden from time immemorial. The Belgian dog (known only by this name)\r\nis a large, compactly built animal, measuring from twenty to thirty\r\ninches in height; the hair is smooth and short, generally tan or dark\r\nbrown in color. It is the custom to crop both ears and tail. The dogs\r\nare usually driven before carts weighing from one hundred to one\r\nhundred and twenty pounds, in teams of from two to six abreast. A\r\nharness very similar in arrangement to that of the horse is used. Six\r\nof these animals will draw from six to eight hundred pounds. They are\r\nput to work when about a year old. They vary in price from twenty-five\r\nto sixty shillings. There are over two thousand dogs in Ghent licensed\r\nas draught animals.\r\n\r\nA plant described by M. Henri Chantrey as most probably answering to\r\nthe manna found by the Hebrews in the desert is the thallophyte\r\n_Canona esculenta_, or edible lichen, which grows in the deserts of\r\nPersia, Arabia, Mesopotamia, and Sahara. It is a grayish cryptogam of\r\nabout the size of a pea, bearing short bracteate appendages on its\r\ntop; when cut, it resembles a mass of dull white flour paste. It is an\r\nephemeral substance, and must be collected the morning it appears, as\r\nit will soon dry up; but when properly prepared it can be kept in a\r\nclose vessel. It is highly appreciated by the wandering Arabs, who\r\nhave often been saved by it from starvation, and they lay up stores of\r\nit when opportunity offers. It is easily collected, for it never\r\nadheres to any foreign body, and, so far as appearance goes, seems as\r\nif it might have been thrown on the ground. There is but little\r\nsuggestion of the mushroom in its taste, which is rather starchy, with\r\na slight flavor of sugar. Cattle are very fond of it. The Arabs boil\r\nit into a gelatinous paste, which they serve in various ways. They\r\npreserve it by drying it in the shade and pack it in bladders or\r\nskins. It is not a complete first-class food, but is very good for a\r\nfew days till something better can be got.\r\n\r\nThe Jernkontoret of Sweden is an ironmasters' exchange at Stockholm,\r\nwhich was founded in 1747 for the financial convenience of the\r\nsubscribers, and now possesses a reserve fund of about $1,500,000. The\r\nfunctions of the society have been considerably enlarged since its\r\ninstitution. It has organized a corps of mining engineers and\r\nmetallurgists, who receive salaries from it, and further from\r\nmanufacturers whom they may serve. They are often commissioned to go\r\nabroad and obtain information and practical hints bearing upon their\r\nprofession. The institution is supported by a light assessment on the\r\nproduction of its constituency. It has a fine building, and publishes\r\nan annual volume in _Jernkontorets Annalen_, containing original\r\nmemoirs and reports from technical agents, which is sent gratuitously\r\nto all the masters of forges in Sweden, and is sold abroad.\r\n\r\nIn a number of glass mirrors of the third and fourth centuries,\r\nexamined by M. Berthelot, the glass was coated with a metallic\r\nsubstance and with a layer of whitish material. The metal proved to be\r\nlead, with no trace of gold, silver, copper, tin, antimony, or\r\nmercury, and no sign of organic substance was present. It was thus\r\nshown that no extraneous material was used to cement the lead to the\r\nglass. The mirrors appeared to have been cut from hollow blown glass\r\nglobes, and it is possible that before the globe was cut the molten\r\nlead had been poured into the interior, and had adhered to the\r\npreviously warmed glass. The whitish layer consisted of lead carbonate\r\nand lead oxide formed by the oxidation of the lead coating and calcium\r\ncarbonate, which had been deposited from the water of the district in\r\nwhich the mirrors were found.\r\n\r\nThe list of recent deaths among men known in connection with science\r\nand its applications includes the names of Prof. Karl Müller,\r\nbotanist, one of the founders of the German scientific weekly, _Die\r\nNatur_, February 9th, aged eighty-one years; Sir John Struthers,\r\nemeritus professor of anatomy in the University of Aberdeen, in his\r\nsixty-seventh year; John Kreusi, mechanical engineer and inventor, at\r\nSchenectady, N.
