The administration of this bath cannot be too\r\nhighly recommended for beetles which have been rendered unrecognizable by\r\ngrease, especially when dust has been mixed with the grease. This\r\nimmersion, of variable duration according to circumstances, will restore\r\nto these insects, however bad they have become, all their brilliancy and\r\nall their first freshness, and the efflorescences of cupric oxide will\r\nnot reappear. This preventive and curative method is also readily\r\napplicable to beetles glued upon paper which have become greasy; plunge\r\nthem into benzine in the same way, and as the gum is insoluble in the\r\nliquid, they remain fastened to their supports. Pruinose beetles, which\r\nare few in number, are the only ones that benzine can alter; the others,\r\nwhich are glabrous, pubescent, or scaly, can only gain by the process,\r\nand they will always make a good show in the collection.--_A.

The main\r\nbuildings are provided with corner pavilions, the atticas of which\r\nproject over the roofs, and these atticas and other parts of the\r\nbuildings are to be surmounted by quadrigas, one of which is shown in\r\nthe annexed cut, taken from the _Illustrirte Zeitung_. This group was\r\nmodeled by V. Pilz, of Vienna, and represents a winged goddess in a\r\nchariot drawn by four spirited steeds harnessed abreast. She holds a\r\nwreath in her raised right hand, and her left hand is represented as\r\nholding the lines for guiding the horses. The group is full of expression\r\nand life, and will add greatly to the beauty of the building to be\r\nsurmounted by it.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe strongest wood in the United States, according to Professor Sargent,\r\nis that of the nutmeg hickory of the Arkansas region, and the weakest the\r\nWest Indian birch _(Rur seva_). The most elastic is the tamarack, the\r\nwhite or shellbark hickory standing far below it. The least elastic and\r\nthe lowest in specific gravity is the wood of the _Ficus aurea_. The\r\nhighest specific gravity, upon which in general depends value as fuel, is\r\nattained by the bluewood of Texas _(Condalia obovata_).\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGLAZED WARE FINIAL.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GLAZED WARE FINIAL.]\r\n\r\nThis grand 16th century finial is a fine example of French ceramic ware,\r\nor glazed terracotta, and it is illustrated both by geometrical elevation\r\nand a cross sectional drawing. This latter shows the clever building up\r\nof the structure by means of a series of five pieces, overlapping each\r\nother, and kept rigid by means of a stout wrought-iron upright in the\r\ncenter, bolted on to the ridge, and strapped down on the hip pieces. Its\r\noutline is well designed for effect when seen at a distance or from\r\nbelow, and its glazed surface heightens the artistic colorings, giving it\r\na brilliant character in the sunlight, as well as protecting the ware\r\nfrom the action of smoke and weather.--_Build. News_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWAGE EARNERS AND THEIR HOUSES.\r\n\r\nMANUFACTURERS AS LANDLORDS.\r\n\r\n\r\nAmong the more prominent movements of the day for the improvement of the\r\ncondition of the working men are those which are growing into fashion\r\nwith large manufacturing incorporations. Their promise lies immediately\r\nin the fact that they call for no new convictions of political economy,\r\nand hence have nothing disturbing or revolutionary about them. Accepting\r\nthe usages and economical principles of industrial life, as the progress\r\nof business has developed them, an increasing number of large\r\nmanufacturers have deemed it to their interest not only to furnish shops\r\nand machinery for their operatives, but dwellings as well, and in some\r\ninstances the equipments of village life, such as schools, chapels,\r\nlibraries, lecture and concert halls, and a regime of morals and\r\nsanitation. Probably the most expensive investment of this sort in the\r\nUnited States, if not in the world, by any single company, is that of\r\nPullman, on Lake Calumet, a few miles south of Chicago, an enterprise as\r\nyet scarcely five years old. It is by no means a novel undertaking,\r\nexcept in the magnitude, thoroughness, and unity of the scheme. Twenty\r\nyears ago the managers of the Lonsdale Mills, in Rhode Island, were\r\nerecting cottages on a uniform plan and maintaining schools and religious\r\nservices for their operatives. More recent but more extensive is the\r\nvillage of the Ponemah Cotton Mill, near Taftville, Conn. These are\r\nillustrations merely of similar investments upon a smaller scale\r\nelsewhere. But the European examples are older, such as Robert Owen's\r\nexperiment at New Lanark in Scotland, Saltaire in Yorkshire, Dollfuss'\r\nMulhausen Quarter in Alsace, and M. Godin's community in the French\r\nvillage of Guise, which are among the more familiar instances of\r\ninvestments originally made on business principles, with a view to the\r\nimproved conditions of workmen. New Lanark failed as a commercial\r\ncommunity through the visionary character of its founder; the Godin works\r\nat Guise have passed into the co-operative phase within the past five\r\nyears, but Saltaire and Mulhausen still retain their proprietary business\r\nfeatures.\r\n\r\nThe class of ventures of which these instances are but the more\r\nconspicuous examples has peculiar characteristics. They differ from the\r\nPeabody and Waterlow buildings of London, described in _Bradstreet's_\r\nlast August, from Starr's Philadelphia dwellings, and from the operations\r\nof the \"Improved Dwellings Association\" of New York in these particulars:\r\nthe latter are financially a pure question of direct investment; are\r\nmainly concerned with life among the poor of cities, and, whatever\r\nphilanthropy may be in their motive, are capable of adaptation to any\r\nclass of citizens. The former, while investments also, are composite, the\r\nbusiness of manufacturing being associated with that of rent collecting\r\nand sharing its profits and losses; their field of operations is almost\r\ninvariably rural, and tenancy is restricted to the employes of the\r\nproprietor. On the other hand, they differ from all co-operative and\r\nsocialistic communities in that they are an adaptation to existing\r\ncircumstances, propose to demonstrate no new theories of economics, are\r\nfree from all religious bonds, do not depend on any unity of opinion, and\r\ndo not touch the question of the proper distribution of wealth.\r\n\r\nIt is, of course, no new thing for owners of large factories,\r\nparticularly in country districts, to furnish tenements for their\r\noperatives, and oftentimes it is quite indispensable that they should,\r\nbecause there would otherwise be no accommodation for their workmen. What\r\nis recent and exceptional is the spread of the belief that it pays to\r\nmake the accommodations furnished healthful, convenient, and attractive.\r\nThe sources of profit from this careful provision are these: the\r\nproprietors have control of the territory, and are able to prescribe\r\nregulations which keep out the saloon and disreputable characters, and at\r\nonce there is a saving in police and court and poor taxes; for the same\r\nreason the workmen are more regular and steady in their labor, for there\r\nis no St. Monday holiday, nor confused head and uncertain hand; the\r\ntenants are better able to pay their rents, and when their landlord and\r\nemployer are the same person, he collects his rent out of the wages; the\r\nsuperior accommodations and more settled employment act strongly against\r\nlabor strikes. It will be seen that the larger and better product of\r\nlabor is a great factor in the profitableness of such enterprises, and\r\nthat it arises from the improved character of the laborer, on the same\r\nprinciple that a farmer's stock pays him best when it is of good breed,\r\nis warmly housed, and well fed. Against the operations of the London\r\nPeabody and Waterlow funds it has been alleged that they dispossess the\r\npoor shiftless tenant and bring in a new class, so that they do not\r\nimprove the condition of their tenants, but afford opportunity for better\r\nones to cheapen the price of their accommodations. The manufacturing\r\nlandlord cannot wholly do this, because the first thing he has to\r\nconsider is whether the applicant for a dwelling is a good workman, not\r\nwhether he can be trusted for his rent. His labor he must have. His\r\noutlook is to make that labor worth more to him, by placing it in the\r\nbest attainable surroundings. Can this be done? If so, the ends of\r\nhumanity are answered as well as the purse filled, for both interests\r\ncorrespond.\r\n\r\nMr. Pullman, who founded the enterprise on Calumet Lake, has uttered\r\nsentiments like these, and has proved that in this instance it does pay\r\nto make his workmen's families comfortable, and secure from sickness and\r\ntemptation. As a financial operation Pullman is profitable. There are now\r\n1,700 dwellings, either separate or in apartment houses, in this town,\r\nwhere five years ago the prairie stretched on every side unbroken. Every\r\ntenement is connected with common sewerage, water, and gas systems, in\r\nwhich the most scientific principles and expert skill have been applied.\r\nThe price of tenements ranges from $5 per month for two rooms in an\r\napartment house to $16 for a separate dwelling of five rooms; but there\r\nis a different class of houses for clerks, superintendents, and\r\noverseers. The average price per room is $3.30 a month, or nearly twelve\r\nper cent. higher than in Massachusetts manufacturing towns, where it is\r\n$2.86. Taking each tenement at an average of three rooms, this rate will\r\npay six per cent. on an investment of $3,140,000, without taking into\r\naccount taxes and repairs, or say six per cent. on $3,000,000. But one\r\nsource of profit of great moment must not be overlooked, and it is the\r\nappreciation of real estate by the increase of population. This is a\r\nsmall factor in a great city, at least so far as concerns the humbler\r\ngrade of dwellings, but in the country it is enormous. A tract of land\r\nwhich has been a farm becomes a village of from 1,000 to 10,000\r\ninhabitants. Its value advances by leaps and bounds.\r\n\r\nAt Pullman, in addition to the shops and dwellings, there are trees and\r\nturf-bordered malls and squares, a church, a theater, a free library with\r\nreading rooms, a public hall, a market house, provided at the expense of\r\nthe company. Liquor can only be sold at the hotel to its guests, and then\r\nunder restrictions. There is a system of public schools under a board of\r\neducation, which is about the only civic organization, strictly speaking,\r\nin the community. One man suffices for police duty, and he made but\r\nfifteen arrests in the last two years. It is reported that the death rate\r\nso far, including the mortality from accidents, has been under seven in\r\n1,000 per annum. In Great Britain the rate is a small fraction over 22 in\r\n1,000. The vital statistics of the United States show a smaller mortality\r\nthan this, but they are rendered abnormal by the heavy immigration which\r\npours into the country. Emigrants are, in the language of insurance men,\r\na selected class. They are usually at the most vigorous time of life and\r\nof hardiest and most enterprising spirit.\r\n\r\nThey leave behind them the very young and the old and those enfeebled by\r\ndisease or habits. To this cause must be attributed in part the\r\nexceptional record of Pullman in death rate, as it is a new town. Yet\r\nthere can be no question that the sanitary conditions of the place are\r\nexcellent. It is difficult in mixed enterprises of this nature to tell\r\nwhat the rate of profit upon the tenement part of the business is, since\r\nthe rental and the factory react upon each other; but in the American\r\ninstances quoted in this article the investment as a whole is\r\nremunerative. In the Godin operations at Guise, which have been\r\nco-operative for the last five years, the capital is put at $1,320,000,\r\nand the net earnings have averaged during that time $204,640 per annum,\r\nor 15½ per cent.\r\n\r\nAt Pullman a demand has arisen on the part of the tenants for a chance to\r\nacquire proprietorship in their homes; and while the company has withheld\r\nthe privilege from its original purchase of 3,500 acres, it has bought\r\nadjoining land, where it offers to advance money for building, and to\r\ntake pay in monthly installments. This assimilates so much of the\r\nenterprise to that at Mulhausen, and shows the drift toward a\r\nco-operative phase of capital and labor. Indeed, this tendency will\r\nprobably prove to be strongly characteristic of all similar schemes as\r\nfast as they attain to any magnitude. Tendencies which can be resisted in\r\ncommunities of few hundreds become overpowering when the population rises\r\ninto thousands. But from the purely commercial point of view, this drift\r\nis hardly to be deprecated, so long as the operation of selling houses\r\nreturns the capital and interest safely.\r\n\r\nProjects of this nature go far toward modifying the stress of antagonisms\r\nbetween labor and capital, because if they are successful these are\r\nharmonized to an appreciable extent, and this gives public interest to\r\nthem. The eventual adjustment must come, not from convictions of duty,\r\ndoctrinaire opinions, or sentiments of sympathy, but on business\r\nprinciples, and it is a sure step in advance to show that self-interest\r\nand philanthropy are in accord. How great the field for experiments of\r\nthis nature is in the United Spates may be gathered from the census of\r\n1880, which shows 2,718,805 persons employed in the industrial\r\nestablishments of the country, with an annual production of\r\n$5,842,000,000, and a capital of nearly half that amount. Of these hands\r\nand values nearly two-thirds belong to the north Atlantic\r\nStates,--_Bradstreet's_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHOTEL DE VILLE, ST. QUENTIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis charming building has an uncommonly well-designed facade,\r\npicturesque in the extreme, rich in detail, and thoroughly dignified. We\r\nare indebted to M. Levy, of Paris, for the loan of M. Garen's spirited\r\netching, from which our illustration is taken. The arcaded piazza on the\r\nground story, the niche-spaced tier of traceried windows on the first\r\nfloor, the flamboyant paneled cornice stage, and the three crowning\r\ngables over it unite in one harmonious conception, the whole elevation\r\nbeing finished by a central tower, while at either end of the facade two\r\nmassively treated buttresses furnish a satisfactory inclosing line, and\r\ngive more than a suggestion of massiveness, so necessary to render an\r\narcaded front like this quite complete within itself; otherwise it must\r\nmore or less appear to be only part of a larger building. The style is\r\nLate Gothic, designed when the first influence of the Early Renaissance\r\nwas beginning to be felt through France as well as Belgium, and in\r\nseveral respects the design has a Flemish character about it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HOTEL DE VILLE, ST. QUENTIN.]\r\n\r\nSt. Quentin is situated on the Goy, in the department of Cotes du Nord,\r\nand the town is seated in a picturesque valley some ten miles S.S.W. of\r\nthe capital, St Brieuc, which is a bishop's see, and has a small harbor\r\nnear the English Channel, and about thirty miles from St.\r\nMalo.--_Building News_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFIRE DOORS IN MILLS.\r\n\r\n[Footnote: From a lecture before the Franklin Institute by C. John\r\nHexamer.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are few parts in fire construction which are of so much importance,\r\nand generally so little understood, as fire doors. Instances of the\r\nfaulty construction of these, even by good builders and architects, may\r\ndaily be seen. Iron doors over wooden sills, with the flooring boards\r\nextending through from one building to the other, are common occurrences.\r\nWe frequently find otherwise good doors hung on wooden jambs by ordinary\r\nscrews. Sliding doors are frequently hung on to woodwork, and all\r\nattachments are frequently so arranged that they would be in a very short\r\ntime destroyed by fire, and cause the door to fall. In case of fire, a\r\nsolid iron door offers no resistance to warping. In an iron lined door,\r\non the contrary, the tendency of the sheet iron to warp is resisted by\r\nthe interior wood, and when this burns into charcoal, it still resists\r\nall warping tendencies. I have seen heavily braced solid iron doors\r\nwarped and turned after a fire, having proved themselves utterly\r\nworthless. It is needless to say that when wooden doors are lined, they\r\nshould be lined on both sides; but frequently we find so-called fireproof\r\ndoors lined on one side only.\r\n\r\nGood doors are frequently blocked up with stock and other material, so\r\nthat in case of fire they could not be closed without great exertion; or\r\nthey have been allowed to get out of order, so that in case of fire they\r\nare useless. This has been so common that it has given rise to the\r\njocular expression of insurance men, when they are told that a fire door\r\nexists between the two buildings, \"Warranted to be open in case of fire.\"\r\nThe strictest regulations should exist in regard to closing the fire\r\ndoors nightly. Frequently we find that although the fire door, and its\r\ndifferent parts, are correctly made, there are openings in the wall which\r\nwould allow the fire to travel from one building to the other, such as\r\nunprotected belt and shaft holes. That a fire door may be effective, it\r\nmust be hung to the only opening in the wall.\r\n\r\nThe greatest care must be exercised to keep joists from extending too far\r\ninto the wall, so as not to touch the joists of the adjacent building,\r\nwhich would transmit the flames from one building to the other in case of\r\nfire. A good stone sill should be placed under the door, and the floor\r\nthereby entirely cut. Sills should be raised about one and a half inches\r\nabove the level of the floor, in order to accomplish the necessary\r\nflooding of the same. If stock must be wheeled from one building to the\r\nother, the sill can be readily beveled on both sides of the wall,\r\nallowing the wheels to pass readily over it. Lintels should consist of\r\ngood brick arches. When swing doors are used, they should be hung on good\r\niron staples, well walled into the masonry, and the staples so arranged\r\nthat the door will have a tendency to close by its own weight. The door\r\nshould consist of two layers of good one and a quarter inch boards,\r\nnailed crosswise, well nailed together and braced, and then covered with\r\nsheet iron nailed on, or if of sheet tin, flanged, soldered, and nailed.\r\nParticular care should be taken to insert plenty of nails, not only along\r\nthe edge of the door, but crosswise in all directions. I have seen cases,\r\nwhere the entire covering had been ripped off through the warping\r\ntendencies of the sheet iron.\r\n\r\nThe hinges on these doors should be good strap hinges, tightly fastened\r\nto the door by bolts extending through it, and secured by nuts on the\r\nother side. Good latches which keep the door in position when closed\r\nshould always be provided. In no case should the door be provided with a\r\nspring lock which cannot be freely opened, as employes might thereby be\r\nconfined in a burning room.\r\n\r\nSliding doors should be hung on wrought iron runways, fastened tightly to\r\nthe wall. Wooden runways iron lined, which we frequently see, are not\r\ngood, as the charring of the wood in the interior causes them to weaken\r\nand the doors to drop. Runways should be on an incline, so that the door\r\nwhen not held open will close itself. Care must be taken to have a stop\r\nprovided in the runway, so that the doors may not, as I have frequently\r\nseen them, overrun the opening which it is to protect. Doors should\r\noverlap the edges of the openings on all sides. Large projecting jambs\r\nshould never be used.\r\n\r\nAll doors contained in \"fire walls\" should have springs or weights\r\nattached to them, so as to be at all times closed. Fire doors can be shut\r\nautomatically by a weight, which is released by the melting of a piece of\r\nvery fusible solder employed for this purpose. So sensitive is this\r\nsolder that a fire door has been made to shut by holding a lamp some\r\ndistance beneath the soldered link and holding an open handkerchief\r\nbetween the lamp and link. Though the handkerchief was not charred, hot\r\nair enough had reached the metal to fuse the solder and allow the\r\napparatus to start into operation.\r\n\r\nThese solders are alloys more fusible than the most fusible of their\r\ncomponent metals. A few of them are: Wood's alloy, consisting of:\r\ncadmium, 1 to 2 parts; tin, 2 parts; lead, 4 parts; bismuth, 7 to 8\r\nparts.\r\n\r\nThis alloy is fusible between 150° and 159° Fahr. The fusible metal of\r\nD'Arcet is composed of: bismuth, 8 parts; lead, 5 parts; tin, 3 parts. It\r\nmelts at 173.3°. We can, therefore, by proper mixture, form a solder\r\nwhich will melt at any desirable temperature. Numerous devices for\r\nclosing doors automatically have been constructed, all depending upon the\r\nuse of the fusible solder catch.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSTEEL STRUCTURES.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt a recent meeting of the Engineers' Club of Philadelphia, Mr. James\r\nChristie presented a paper upon \"The Adaptation of Steel to Structural\r\nWork.\" The price of steel has now fallen so low, as compared with iron,\r\nthat its increased use will be actively stimulated as the building\r\nindustries revive. The grades and properties of the steels are so\r\ndistinct and various that opinions differ much as to the adaptability of\r\neach grade for a special purpose. Hitherto, engineers have favored open\r\nhearth steel on account of uniformity, but recent results obtained from\r\nBessemer steel tend to place either make on equality. The seeming\r\ntendency is to specify what the physical properties shall be, and not how\r\nthe steel shall be made.\r\n\r\nFor boiler and ship plates, the mildest and most ductile steel is\r\nfavored. For ships' frames and beams, a harder steel, up to 75,000 pounds\r\ntenacity, is frequently used. For tension members of bridges, steel of\r\n65,000 to 75,000 pounds tenacity is usually specified; and for\r\ncompression members, 80,000 to 90,000 pounds. In the Forth Bridge,\r\ncompression steel is limited to 75,000 to 82,000 pounds. Such a marked\r\nadvantage occurs from the use of high tension steel in compression\r\nmembers, and the danger of sudden failure of a properly made strut is so\r\nlittle, that future practice will favor the use of hard steel in\r\ncompression, unless the material should prove untrustworthy. In columns,\r\neven as long as forty diameters, steel of 90,000 pounds tenacity will\r\nexceed the mildest steel 35 per cent., or iron 50 per cent., in\r\ncompressive resistance.\r\n\r\nThe present uncertainty consists largely as to how high-tension steel\r\nwill endure the manipulation usual with iron without injury. A few\r\nexperiments were recently made by the writer on riveted struts of both\r\nmild and hard steel, which had been punched, straightened, and riveted,\r\nas usual with iron, but no indication of deterioration was found.\r\n\r\nSteel castings are now made entirely trustworthy for tensile working\r\nstresses of 10,000 to 15,000 pounds per square inch. In some portable\r\nmachinery, an intermittent tensile stress is applied of 15,000 pounds,\r\nsometimes rising to 20,000 pounds per square inch of section, without any\r\nevidence of weakness.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nEqual volumes of amyl alcohol (rectified fusel oil) and pure concentrated\r\nhydrochloric acid, shaken together in a test tube, unite to form a single\r\ncolorless liquid; if one volume of benzine (from petroleum) be added to\r\nthis, and the tube well shaken, the contents will soon separate into\r\n_three_ distinct colorless fluids, the planes of demarkation being\r\nclearly discernible by transmitted light.

Jour._]\r\n\r\nBy WILLIAM H. PICKERING.\r\n\r\n\r\nWithin the last few years the subject of dry plate photography has\r\nIncreased very rapidly, not only in general popularity, but also in\r\nimportance in regard to its applications to other departments of science.\r\nNumerous plate manufacturers have sprung up in this country as well as\r\nabroad, and each naturally claims all the good qualities for his own\r\nplates. It therefore seemed desirable that some tests should be made\r\nwhich would determine definitely the validity of these claims, and that\r\nthey should be made in such a manner that other persons using instruments\r\nsimilarly constructed would be able to obtain the same results.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most important tests needed are in regard to the\r\nsensitiveness of the plates. Most plate makers use the wet plates as\r\ntheir standard, giving the sensitiveness of the dry plates at from two to\r\nsixty times greater; but as wet plates vary quite as much as dry ones,\r\ndepending on the collodion, condition of the bath, etc., this system is\r\nvery unsatisfactory. Another method, employed largely in England, depends\r\non the use of the Warnerke sensitometer. In this instrument the light\r\nfrom a tablet coated with luminous paint just after being exposed to a\r\nmagnesium light is permitted to shine through a colored transparent film\r\nof graduated density upon the plate to be tested. Each degree on the film\r\nhas a number, and, after a given exposure, the last number photographed\r\non the plate represents the sensitiveness on an empirical scale. There\r\nare two or three objections to this instrument. In the first place, the\r\nlight-giving power of the luminous tablet is liable to variations, and,\r\nif left in a warm, moist place, it rapidly deteriorates. Again, it has\r\nbeen shown by Captain Abney that plates sensitized by iodides, bromides,\r\nand chlorides, which may be equally sensitive to white light, are not\r\nequally affected by the light emitted by the paint; the bromides being\r\nthe most rapidly darkened, the chlorides next, and the iodides least of\r\nall. The instrument is therefore applicable only to testing plates\r\nsensitized with the same salts.\r\n\r\nIn this investigation it was first shown that the plates most sensitive\r\nfor one colored light were not necessarily the most so for light of\r\nanother color. Therefore it was evident that the sun must be used as the\r\nultimate source of light, and it was concluded to employ the light\r\nreflected from the sky near the zenith as the direct source. But as this\r\nwould vary in brilliancy from day to day, it was necessary to use some\r\nmethod which would avoid the employment of an absolute standard of light.\r\nIt is evident that we may escape the use of this troublesome standard, if\r\nwe can obtain some material which has a perfectly uniform sensitiveness;\r\nfor we may then state the sensitiveness of our plates in terms of this\r\nsubstance, regardless of the brilliancy of our source. The first material\r\ntried was white filter paper, salted and sensitized in a standard\r\nsolution of silver nitrate. This was afterward replaced by powdered\r\nsilver chloride, chemically pure, which was found to be much more\r\nsensitive than that made from the commercial chemicals. This powder is\r\nspread out in a thin layer, in a long paper cell, on a strip of glass.\r\nThe cell measures one centimeter broad by ten in length. Over this is\r\nlaid a sheet of tissue paper, and above that a narrow strip of black\r\npaper, so arranged so as to cover the chloride for its full length and\r\nhalf its breadth. These two pieces of paper are pasted on to the under\r\nside of a narrow strip of glass which is placed on top of the paper cell.\r\nThe apparatus in which the exposures are made consists of a box a little\r\nover a meter in length, closed at the top by a board, in which is a\r\ncircular aperture 15'8 cm. in diameter. Over this board may be placed a\r\ncover, in the center of which is a hole 0.05 cm. in diameter, which\r\ntherefore lets through 0.00001 as much light as the full aperture. The\r\nsilver chloride is placed a distance of just one meter from the larger\r\naperture, and over it is placed the photographic scale, which might be\r\nmade of tinted gelatines, or, as in the present case, constructed of long\r\nstrips of tissue paper, of varying widths, and arranged like a flight of\r\nsteps; so that the light passing through one side of the scale traverses\r\nnine strips of paper, while that through the other side traverses only\r\none strip. Each strip cuts off about one-sixth of the light passing\r\nthrough it, so that, taking the middle strip as unity, the strips on\r\neither side taken in order will transmit approximately--\r\n\r\n 1    2    3    4    5    6    7    8    9\r\n2.0  1.65 1.4  1.2  1.0  0.85 0.7  0.6  0.5\r\n\r\nThe instrument is now pointed toward the zenith for about eight minutes,\r\non a day when there is a bright blue sky. On taking the apparatus into\r\nthe dark room and viewing the impression by gaslight, it will be found\r\nthat the markings, which are quite clear at one end, have entirely faded\r\nout by the time the middle division is reached. The last division clearly\r\nmarked is noted. Five strips cut from sensitized glass plates, ten\r\ncentimeters long and two and a half in width, are now placed side by side\r\nunder the scale, in the place of the chloride. By this means we can test,\r\nif we wish, five different kinds of plates at once. The cover of the\r\nsensitometer containing the 0.05cm. hole is put on, and the plates\r\nexposed to sky light for a time varying anywhere between twenty seconds\r\nand three minutes, depending on the sensitiveness of the plates. The\r\ninstrument is then removed to the dark room, and the plates developed by\r\nimmersing them all at once in a solution consisting of four parts\r\npotassium oxalate and one part ferrous sulphate. After ten minutes they\r\nare removed, fixed, and dried. Their readings are then noted, and\r\ncompared with those obtained with the silver chloride. The chloride\r\nexperiment is again performed as soon as the plates have been removed,\r\nand the first result confirmed. With some plates it is necessary to make\r\ntwo or three trials before the right exposure can be found; but if the\r\nimage disappears anywhere between the second and eighth divisions, a\r\nsatisfactory result may be obtained.\r\n\r\nThe plates were also tested using gaslight instead of daylight. In this\r\ncase an Argand burner was employed burning five cubic feet of gas per\r\nhour. A diaphragm 1 cm. in diameter was placed close to the glass\r\nchimney, and the chloride was placed at 10 cm. distance, and exposed to\r\nthe light coming from the brightest part of the flame, for ten hours.\r\nThis produced an impression as far as the third division of the scale.\r\nThe plates were exposed in the sensitometer as usual, except that it was\r\nfound convenient in several cases to use a larger stop, measuring 0.316\r\ncm. in diameter.\r\n\r\nThe following table gives the absolute sensitiveness of several of the\r\nbest known kinds of American and foreign plates, when developed with\r\noxalate, in terms of pure silver chloride taken as a standard. As the\r\nnumbers would be very large, however, if the chloride were taken as a\r\nunit, it was thought better to give them in even hundred thousands.\r\n\r\nSENSITIVENESS OF PLATES.\r\n\r\nPlates.

A somewhat prolonged research would indicate what\r\neffect the presence of sunspots had on solar radiation--whether it was\r\nincreased or diminished.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNATURAL GAS FUEL AND ITS APPLICATION TO MANUFACTURING\r\nPURPOSES.\r\n\r\n[Footnote: Read before the Iron and Steel Institute of London, May 8,\r\n1885.]\r\n\r\nBy Mr. ANDREW CARNEGIE, New York.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn these days of depression in manufacturing, the world over, it is\r\nspecially cheering to be able to dwell upon something of a pleasant\r\ncharacter. Listen, therefore, while I tell you about the natural gas fuel\r\nwhich we have recently discovered in the Pittsburg district. That\r\nPittsburg should have been still further favored in the matter of fuel\r\nseems rather unfair, for she has long been noted for the cheapest fuel in\r\nthe world. The actual cost of coal, to such as mine their own, has been\r\nbetween 4s. and 5s. per ton; while slack, which has always been very\r\nlargely used for making gas in Siemens furnaces and under boilers, has\r\nranged from 2s. to 2s. 6d. per ton. Some mills situated near the mines or\r\nupon the rivers for many years received slack coal at a cost not\r\nexceeding 1s. 6d. per ton. It is this cheap fuel which natural gas has\r\ncome to supplant. It is now many years since the pumping engines at oil\r\nwells were first run by gas, obtained in small quantities from many of\r\nthe holes which failed to yield oil. In several cases immense gas wells\r\nwere found near the oil district; but some years elapsed before there\r\noccurred to any one the idea of piping it to the nearest manufacturing\r\nestablishments, which were those about Pittsburg. Several years ago the\r\nproduct of several gas wells in the Butler region was piped to two mills\r\nat Sharpsburg, five miles from the city of Pittsburg, and there used as\r\nfuel, but not with such triumphant success as to attract much attention\r\nto the experiment. Failures of supply, faults in the tubing, and\r\nimperfect appliances for use at the mills combined to make the new fuel\r\ntroublesome. Seven years ago a company drilled for oil at Murraysville,\r\nabout eighteen miles from Pittsburg. A depth of 1,320 feet had been\r\nreached when the drills were thrown high in the air, and the derrick\r\nbroken to pieces and scattered around by a tremendous explosion of gas.\r\nThe roar of escaping gas was heard in Munroville, five miles distant.\r\nAfter four pipes, each two inches in diameter, had been laid from the\r\nmouth of the well and the flow directed through them, the gas was\r\nignited, and the whole district for miles round was lighted up. This\r\nvaluable fuel, although within nine miles of our steel-rail mills at\r\nPittsburg, was permitted to waste for five years. It may well be asked\r\nwhy we did not at once secure the property and utilize this fuel; but the\r\nbusiness of conducting it to the mills and there using it was not well\r\nunderstood until recently. Besides this, the cost of a line was then more\r\nthan double what it is now; we then estimated that £140,000 would be\r\nrequired to introduce the new fuel. The cost to-day does not exceed\r\n£1,500 per mile. As our coal was not costing us more than 3s. per ton of\r\nfinished rails, the inducement was not in our opinion great enough to\r\njustify the expenditure of so much capital and taking the risk of failure\r\nof the supply. Two years ago men who had more knowledge of the oil-wells\r\nthan ourselves had sufficient faith in the continuity of the gas supply\r\nto offer to furnish us with gas for a sum per year equal to that hitherto\r\nannually paid for coal until the amount expended by them on piping had\r\nbeen repaid, and afterward at half that sum. It took us about eighteen\r\nmonths to recoup the gas company, and we are now working under the\r\npermanent arrangement of one-half the previous cost of fuel on cars at\r\nwork. Since our success in the use of this new natural fuel at the rail\r\nmills, parties still bolder have invested in lines of piping to the city\r\nof Pittsburg, fifteen to eighteen miles from the wells. The territory\r\nunderlain with this natural gas has not yet been clearly defined. At the\r\nprincipal field, that of Murraysville (from which most of the gas is\r\nobtained to-day), I found, upon my visit to that interesting region last\r\nautumn, that nine wells had been sunk, and were yielding gas in large\r\nquantities. One of these was estimated as yielding 30,000,000 cubic feet\r\nin 24 hours. This district lies to the northeast of Pittsburg, running\r\nsouthward from it toward the Pennsylvania Railroad. Gas has been found\r\nupon a belt averaging about half a mile in width for a distance of\r\nbetween four and five miles. Beyond that again we reach a point where\r\nsalt water flows into the wells and drowns the gas. Several wells have\r\nbeen bored upon this belt near the Pennsylvania Railroad, and have been\r\nfound useless from this cause. Geologists tell us that in this region a\r\ndepression of 600 feet occurs in the strata, but how far the fault\r\nextends has not yet been ascertained. Wells will no doubt soon be sunk\r\nsouthward of the Pennsylvania Railroad upon this half-mile belt. Swinging\r\nround toward the southwest, and about twenty miles from the city, we\r\nreach the gas fields of Washington county. The wells so far struck do not\r\nappear to be as strong as those of the Murraysville district, but it is\r\npossible that wells equally productive may be found there hereafter.\r\nThere are now four wells yielding gas in the district, and others are\r\nbeing drilled. Passing still further to the west, we reach another gas\r\nterritory, from which manufacturing works in Beaver Falls and Rochester,\r\nsome twenty-eight miles west of Pittsburg, receive their supply.\r\nProceeding with the circle we are drawing in imagination around\r\nPittsburg, we pass from the west to the southwest without finding gas in\r\nany considerable quantity, until we reach the Butler gas field,\r\nequidistant from Pittsburg on the northwest, with Washington county wells\r\non the southwest. Proceeding now from the Butler field to the Allegheny\r\nRiver, we reach the Tarentum district, still about twenty miles from\r\nPittsburg, which is supplying a considerable portion of the gas used.\r\nDrawing thus a circle around Pittsburg, with a radius of fifteen to\r\ntwenty miles, we find four distinct gas-producing districts. In the city\r\nof Pittsburg itself several wells have been bored; but the fault before\r\nmentioned seems to extend toward the center of the circle, as salt water\r\nhas rushed in and rendered these wells wholly unproductive, though gas\r\nwas found in all of them.\r\n\r\nI spent a few days very pleasantly last autumn driving with some friends\r\nto the two principal fields, the Murraysville and the Washington county.\r\nIn the former district the gas rushes with such velocity through a 6-inch\r\npipe, extending perhaps 20 feet above the surface, that it does not\r\nignite within 6 feet of the mouth of the pipe. Looking up into the clear\r\nblue sky, you see before you a dancing golden fiend, without visible\r\nconnection with the earth, swayed by the wind into fantastic shapes, and\r\nwhirling in every direction. As the gas from the well strikes the center\r\nof the flame and passes partly through it, the lower part of the mass\r\ncurls inward, giving rise to the most beautiful effects gathered into\r\ngraceful folds at the bottom--a veritable pillar of fire. There is not a\r\nparticle of smoke from it. The gas from the wells at Washington was\r\nallowed to escape through pipes which lay upon the ground. Looking down\r\nfrom the roadside upon the first well we saw in the valley, there\r\nappeared to be an immense circus-ring, the verdure having been burnt and\r\nthe earth baked by the flame. The ring was quite round, as the wind had\r\ndriven the flame in one direction after another, and the effect of the\r\ngreat golden flame lying prone upon the earth, swaying and swirling with\r\nthe wind in every direction, was most startling. The great beast\r\nApollyon, minus the smoke, seemed to have come forth from his lair again.\r\nThe cost of piping is now estimated, at the present extremely low prices,\r\nwith right of way, at £1,600 sterling per mile, so that the cost of a\r\nline to Pittsburg may be said to be about £27,000 sterling. The cost of\r\ndrilling is about £1,000, and the mode of procedure is as follows: A\r\nderrick being first erected, a 6 inch wrought-iron pipe is driven down\r\nthrough the soft earth till rock is reached from 75 to 100 feet. Large\r\ndrills, weighing from 3,000 to 4,000 lb., are now brought into use; these\r\nrise and fall with a stroke of 4 to 5 feet. The fuel to run these drills\r\nis conveyed by small pipes from adjoining wells. An 8-inch hole having\r\nbeen bored to a depth of about 500 feet, a 5-5/8 inch wrought-iron pipe\r\nis put down to shut off the water. The hole is then continued 6 inches in\r\ndiameter until gas is struck, when a 4-inch pipe is put down. From forty\r\nto sixty days are consumed in sinking the well and striking gas. The\r\nlargest well known is estimated to yield about 30,000,000 cubic feet of\r\ngas in twenty-four hours, but half of this may be considered as the\r\nproduct of a good well. The pressure of gas as it issues from the mouth\r\nof the well is nearly or quite 200 lb. per square inch. One of the gauges\r\nwhich I examined showed a pressure of 187 lb. Even at works where we use\r\nthe gas nine miles from the well, the pressure is 75 lb. per square inch.\r\nAt one of the wells, where it was desirable to have a supply of pure\r\nwater, I found a small engine worked by the direct pressure of the gas as\r\nit came from the well; and an excellent supply of water was thus obtained\r\nfrom a spring in the valley. Eleven lines of pipe now convey gas from the\r\nvarious wells to the manufacturing establishments in and around\r\nPittsburg. The largest of these for the latter part of the distance is 12\r\ninches in diameter. Several are of 8 inches throughout. The lines\r\noriginally laid are 6 inches in diameter. Many of the mills have as yet\r\nno appliances for using the gas, and much of it is still wasted. It is\r\nestimated that the iron and steel mills of the city proper require fuel\r\nequal to 166,000 bushels of coal per day; and though it is only two years\r\nsince gas was first used in Pittsburg, it has already displaced about\r\n40,000 bushels of coal per day in these mills. Sixty odd glass works,\r\nwhich required about 20,000 bushels of coal per day, mostly now use the\r\nnatural gas. In the work around Pittsburg beyond the city limits, the\r\namount of coal superseded by gas is about equal to that displaced in the\r\ncity. The estimated number of men whose labor will be dispensed with in\r\nPittsburg when gas is generally used is 5,000. It is only a question of a\r\nfew months when all the manufacturing carried on in the district will be\r\noperated with the new fuel. As will be seen from the analyses appended to\r\nthis paper, it is a much purer fuel than coal; and this is a quality\r\nwhich has proved of great advantage in the manufacture of steel, glass,\r\nand several other products. With the exception of one, and perhaps two\r\nconcerns, no effort has been made to economize in the use of the new\r\nfuel. In our Union Iron Mills we have attached to each puddling furnace a\r\nsmall regenerative appliance, by the aid of which we save a large\r\npercentage of fuel. The gas companies will no doubt soon require\r\nmanufacturers to adopt some such appliance. At present, owing to the\r\nfact that there is a large surplus constantly going to waste, they allow\r\nthe gas to be used to any extent desired. Contracts are now made to\r\nsupply houses with gas for all purposes at a cost equal to that of the\r\ncoal bill for the preceding year. In the residences of several of our\r\npartners no fuel other than this gas is now used, and everybody who has\r\napplied it to domestic purposes is delighted with the change from the\r\nsmoky and dirty bituminous coal. Some, indeed, go so far as to say that\r\nif the gas were three times as costly as the old fuel, they could not be\r\ninduced to go back to the latter. It is therefore quite within the region\r\nof probability that the city, now so black that even Sheffield must be\r\nconsidered clean in comparison, may be so revolutionized as to be the\r\ncleanest manufacturing center in the world. A walk through our rolling\r\nmills would surprise the members of the Institute. In the steel rail\r\nmills for instance, where before would have been seen thirty stokers\r\nstripped to the waist, firing boilers which require a supply of about 400\r\ntons of coal in twenty-four hours--ninety firemen in all being employed,\r\neach working eight hours--they would now find one man walking around the\r\nboiler house, simply watching the water gauges, etc. Not a particle of\r\nsmoke would be seen. In the iron mills the puddlers have whitewashed the\r\ncoal bunkers belonging to their furnaces. I need not here say how much\r\npleasure it will afford me to arrange that any fellow members of the\r\nInstitute who may visit the republic are afforded an opportunity to see\r\nfor themselves this latest and most interesting development of the fuel\r\nquestion. Good Mother Earth supplies us with all the fuel we can use and\r\nmore, and only asks us to lead it under our boilers and into our heating\r\nand puddling furnaces, and apply the match. During the winter several\r\nexplosions have occurred in Pittsburg, owing to the escape of gas from\r\npipes improperly laid. The frost having penetrated the earth for several\r\nfeet and prevented escape upward, the freed gas found its way into the\r\ncellars of houses, and, as it is odorless, its presence was not detected.\r\nThis resulted in several alarming explosions; but the danger is to be\r\nremedied before next year. Lower pressure will be carried in the pipes\r\nthrough the city, and escape pipes leading to the surface will be placed\r\nalong the surface at frequent intervals. In the case of manufacturing\r\nestablishments, the gas is led into the mills overhead, and, all the\r\npipes being in the open air, no danger of explosion is incurred.\r\n\r\nThe following extract from the report of a committee, made to the\r\nAmerican Society of Mechanical Engineers at a recent meeting, gives an\r\nidea of the value of the new fuel: \"Natural gas, next to hydrogen, is the\r\nmost powerful of the gaseous fuels, and, if properly applied, one of the\r\nmost economical, as very nearly its theoretical heating power can be\r\nutilized in evaporating water. Being so free from all deleterious\r\nelements, notably sulphur, it makes better iron, steel, and glass than\r\ncoal fuel. It makes steam more regularly, as there is no opening of\r\ndoors, and no blank spaces are left on the grate bars to let cold air in,\r\nand, when properly arranged, regulates the steam pressure, leaving the\r\nman in charge nothing to do but to look after the water, and even that\r\ncould be accomplished if one cared to trust to such a volatile\r\nwater-tender. Boilers will last longer, and there will be fewer\r\nexplosions from unequal expansion and contraction, due from cold draughts\r\nof air being let in on hot plates.\r\n\r\n\"An experiment was made to ascertain the value of gas as a fuel in\r\ncomparison with coal in generating steam, using a retort or boiler of 42\r\ninches diameter, 10 feet long, with 4 inch tubes. It was first fired with\r\nselected Youghiogheny coal, broken to about 4 inch cubes, and the furnace\r\nwas charged in a manner to obtain the best results possible with the\r\nstack that was attached to the boiler. Nine pounds of water evaporated to\r\nthe pound of coal consumed was the best result obtained. The water was\r\nmeasured by two meters, one in the suction and the other in the\r\ndischarge. The water was fed into a heater at a temperature of from 60°\r\nto 62°; the heater was placed in the flue leading from the boiler to the\r\nstack in both gas and coal experiments. In making the calculations, the\r\nstandard 76 lb. bushel of the Pittsburg district was used. Six hundred\r\nand eighty-four pounds of water were evaporated per bushel, which was\r\n60.9 per cent. of the theoretical value of the coal. Where gas was burned\r\nunder the same boiler, but with a different furnace, and taking 1 lb. of\r\ngas to be 2.35 cubic feet, the water evaporated was found to be 20.31\r\nlb., or 83.4 per cent. of the theoretical heat units were utilized. The\r\nsteam was under the atmospheric pressure, there being a large enough\r\nopening to prevent any back pressure, the combustion of both gas and coal\r\nwas not hurried. It was found that the lower row of tubes could be\r\nplugged and the same amount of water could be evaporated with the coal;\r\nbut with gas, by closing all the tubes--on the end next the stack--except\r\nenough to get rid of the products of combustion, when the pressure on the\r\nwalls of the furnace was three ounces, and the fire forced to its best,\r\nit was found that very nearly the same results could be obtained. Hence\r\nit was concluded that the most of the work was done on the shell of the\r\nboiler.\"\r\n\r\nIn no other way can I give the members of the Iron and Steel Institute so\r\nmuch information in regard to this new fuel as by including in this paper\r\na very able communication from the chief chemist at our Edgar Thomson\r\nSteel Works, Mr. S.A. Ford, who is to-day the highest authority upon the\r\nsubject:\r\n\r\n\"So much has been claimed for natural gas as regards the superiority of\r\nits heating properties as compared with coal, that some analyses of this\r\ngas, together with calculations showing the comparison between its\r\nheating power and that of coal, may be of interest. These calculations\r\nare, of course, theoretical in both cases, and it must not be imagined\r\nthat the total amount of heat, either in a ton of coal or 1,000 cubic\r\nfeet of natural gas, can ever be fully utilized. In making these\r\ncalculations I employed as a basis what in my estimation was a gas of an\r\naverage chemical composition, as I have found that gas from the same well\r\nvaries continually in its composition. Thus, samples of gas from the same\r\nwell, but taken on different days, vary in nitrogen from 23 per cent. to\r\n_nil_, carbonic acid from 2 per cent. to _nil_, oxygen from 4 per cent,\r\nto 0.4 per cent., and so with all the component gases. Before giving the\r\ntheoretical heating power of 1,000 cubic feet of this gas I will note a\r\nfew analyses. The first four are of gas from the same well; samples\r\ntaken on the same day that they were analyzed. The two last are from two\r\ndifferent wells in the East Liberty district:\r\n\r\n                          ANALYSES OF NATURAL GAS.\r\n\r\n--------------------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+\r\n                    |   1    |    2   |    3   |   4    |   5    |   6    |\r\n--------------------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+\r\nWhen tested.........|10-28-84|10-29-84|11-24-84|12-4-84 |10-18-84|10-25-84|\r\n                    | per ct.| per ct.| per ct.| per ct.| per ct.| per ct.|\r\nCarbonic acid ......|    0.8 |    0.6 |   Nil. |   0.4  |  Nil.  |    0.30|\r\nCarbonic oxide......|    1.0 |    0.8 |    .58 |   0.4  |    1.0 |    0.30|\r\nOxygen... ... ......|    1.1 |    0.8 |    .78 |   0.8  |    2.10|    1.20|\r\nOlefiant gas .......|    0.7 |    0.8 |    0.98|   0.6  |    0.80|    0.6 |\r\nEthylic hydride ....|    3.6 |    5.5 |    7.92|  12.30 |    5.20|    4.8 |\r\nMarsh gas ..........|   72.18|   65.25|   60.70|  49.58 |   57.85|   75.16|\r\nHydrogen ...........|   20.02|   26.16|   29.03|  35.92 |    9.64|   14.45|\r\nNitrogen ...........|  Nil.  |  Nil.  |  Nil.  | Nil.   |   23.41|    2.89|\r\nHeat units .........|728,746 |698,852 |627,170 |745,813 |592,380 |745,591 |\r\n--------------------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+\r\n\r\n\"We will now show how the natural gas compares with coal, weight for\r\nweight, or, in other words, how many cubic feet of natural gas contain as\r\nmany heat units as a given weight of coal, say a ton.

Now, 1,000 cubic feet of this gas will weigh\r\n265,887 grains, or in round numbers 38 lb. avoirdupois. We find that\r\n64.8585 grammes, or 1,000 grains, of carbon contain 523,046 heat units,\r\nand 265,887 grains, or 38 lb., of carbon contain 139,398,896 heat units.\r\nThen 57.25 lb. of carbon contain the same number of heat units as 1,000\r\ncubic feet of the natural gas, viz., 210,069,604.

The\r\n64.4 lb. of this coal contains 210,069,640 heat units, or 54.4 lb. of\r\ncoal is equal in its heating power to 1,000 cubic feet of natural gas. If\r\nour coal cost us 5s. per ton of 2,000 lb., then 54.4 lb. costs 1.632d.,\r\nand 1,000 cubic feet of gas is worth for its heat units 1.632d. As the\r\nprice of coal increases or decreases, the value of the gas will naturally\r\nvary in like proportions. Thus, with the price of coal at 10s. per ton\r\nthe gas will be worth 3.264d. per 1,000 cubic feet. If 54.4 lb. of coal\r\nis equal to 1,000 cubic feet of gas, then one ton, or 2,000 lb., is equal\r\nto 36,764 cubic feet, or 2,240 lb. of coal is equal to 40,768 cubic feet\r\nof natural gas. If we compare this gas with anthracite coal, we find that\r\n1,000 cubic feet of gas is equal to 58.4 lb. of this coal, and 2,000 lb.\r\nof coal is equal to 34,246 cubic feet of natural gas. Then, if this coal\r\ncost 26s. per ton, 1,000 cubic feet of natural gas is worth 9½d. for its\r\nheating power. In collecting samples of this gas I have noticed some very\r\ninteresting deposits from the wells. Thus, in one well the pipe was\r\nnearly filled up with a soft grayish-white material, which proved on\r\ntesting to be chloride of calcium. In another well, soon after the gas\r\nvein had been struck, crystals of carbonate of ammonia were thrown out,\r\nand upon testing the gas I found a considerable amount of that alkali,\r\nand with this well no chloride of calcium was observed until about two\r\nmonths after the gas had been struck. In these calculations of the\r\nheating power of gas and coal no account is of course taken of the loss\r\nof heat by radiation, etc. My object has been to compare these two fuels\r\nmerely as regards their actual value in heat units.\"\r\n\r\nBearing in mind that it is never wise to prophesy unless you know, I\r\nhesitate to speak of the future; but considering the experience we have\r\nhad in regard to the productiveness of the oil territory, which is now\r\nyielding 70,000 barrels of petroleum per day, and which has continued to\r\nincrease year after year for twenty years, I see no reason to doubt the\r\nopinion of experts that the territory which has already been proved to\r\nyield gas will suffice for at least the present generation in and about\r\nPittsburg.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA GAS-ENGINE WATER-SUPPLY ALARM.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nA very useful contrivance for the purpose of reporting automatically the\r\nfailure of the water supply to a gas-engine has been arranged by\r\nProfessor Ph. Carl, of Munich. What led to the adoption of the device was\r\nthat, during last winter, the water supply in the neighborhood of the\r\nProfessor's laboratory was several times cut off without previous notice;\r\nthe result being the failure of the water needed for cooling the cylinder\r\nof his Otto gas-engine. On inquiring into the matter, he discovered that\r\nthe same thing frequently occurred in other places where gas-engines were\r\nin use; and this caused him to design a contrivance to put an alarm-bell\r\ninto action at the instant when the water ceased to flow, and so enable\r\nany overheating of the engine, and injuries thereby resulting, to be\r\nprevented in time. The arrangement (represented half size in the\r\naccompanying engraving) is screwed down directly to the water outflow\r\npipe, R. Before the aperture of the pipe is a lever, with a disk on one\r\narm, on to which the issuing water impinges, thereby keeping the lever in\r\nthe position indicated by the dotted lines. The effect of this is to\r\nbreak the platinum contact at C, and so interrupt the circuit of an\r\nalarm-bell placed in any suitable position. Suppose the water ceases to\r\nflow; the spring, F, comes into play, contact is made at C, and the bell\r\ncontinues to ring till some one comes to stop it. It is almost needless\r\nto remark that the disk, D, and the pin, E, are composed of insulating\r\nmaterial, such as vulcanite.--_Jour.

PRATT, F.C.S.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt frequently happens in the laboratory that platinum vessels, after\r\nlong-continued use, begin to show signs of wear, and become perforated\r\nwith minute pinholes. When they have reached this stage, they are usually\r\naccounted of no further utility, and are disposed of as scrap; not that\r\nit is impossible to repair them--for with fine gold wire and an\r\noxyhydrogen jet this is easily feasible--but that the proper appliances\r\nand skill are not in possession of all. Irrespective of the manipulation\r\nof the hydrogen jet, it is rather difficult without long practice to hold\r\nthe end of the fine wire precisely over the aperture and to keep it in\r\nposition. It occurred to me that, if the gold in a finely divided\r\ncondition could be placed in very intimate contact with the platinum,\r\njudging from the fusibility of gold-platinum alloys, union could be\r\neffected at a lower temperature over the ordinary gas blowpipe. I tried\r\nthe experiment, and found the supposition correct. The substance I used\r\nwas auric chloride, AuCl_{3}, which, as is well known, splits up on\r\nheating, first into aurous chloride, and at a higher temperature gives\r\noff all its chlorine and leaves metallic gold. Operating on a perforated\r\nplatinum basin, in the first instance, I placed a few milligrammes of the\r\naurous chloride from a 15 grain tube precisely over the perforation, and\r\nthen gently heated to about 200° C. till the salt melted and ran through\r\nthe holes. A little further heating caused the reduced gold to solidify\r\non each side of the basin. The blowpipe was now brought to bear on the\r\nbottom of the dish, right over the particular spots it was wished to\r\nsolder, and in a few moments, at a yellow-red heat (in daylight), the\r\ngold was seen to \"run.\" On the vessel being immediately withdrawn, a very\r\nneat soldering was evident. The operation was repeated several times,\r\ntill in a few minutes the dish had been rendered quite tight and\r\nserviceable.\r\n\r\nUsing the gold salt in this way, the principal difficulty experienced in\r\nholding gold wire unflinchingly in the exact position vanishes, while\r\nonly a comparatively low temperature and small amount of gold is\r\nnecessary. Care must be taken to withdraw the platinum from the flame\r\njust at the moment the gold is seen to run, for if the heat be continued\r\nlonger, the gold alloys with a larger surface of platinum, spreads, and\r\nleaves the aperture empty. As in the case of all gold-soldered vessels,\r\nthe article cannot afterward be safely exposed to a temperature higher\r\nthan that at which the soldering was effected, and on this account it is\r\nadvisable to use as small an amount of auric chloride as possible. When\r\nthe perforations are of comparatively large size, the repairing is not so\r\neasy, owing to the auric chloride, on fusing, refusing to fill them. I\r\nfind, however, that if some spongy platinum be mixed with a few\r\nmilligrammes of the gold salt, pressed into the perforation, and heat\r\napplied as directed, a very good soldering can be effected. It is well to\r\nhammer the surface of the platinum while hot, so as to secure perfect\r\nunion and welding of the two surfaces. This may be done in a few minutes\r\nin such a manner as to render the repair indistinguishable. Strips of\r\nplatinum may be joined together in much the same way as already\r\ndescribed--a few crystals of auric chloride placed on each clean surface\r\nand gently heated till nearly black, then bound together and further\r\nheated for a few moments in the blowpipe flame. Rings and tubes can also\r\nbe formed on a mandrel, and soldered in the same fashion, and the chemist\r\nthus enabled to build up small pieces of apparatus from sheet platinum in\r\nthe laboratory.--_Chem. News._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE HELICOIDAL OR WIRE STONE SAW.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe sides of solid bodies, whatever be the degree of hardness, and\r\nhowever fine the texture, possess surfaces formed of a succession of\r\nprojections and depressions. When two bodies are in contact, these\r\nprojections and indentations fit into one another, and the adherence that\r\nresults is proportional to the degree of roughness of the surfaces. If,\r\nby a more or less energetic mechanical action, we move one of the bodies\r\nwith respect to the other, we shall produce, according as the action\r\novercomes cohesion, more or less disintegration of the bodies. The\r\nresulting wear in each of them will evidently be inversely proportional\r\nto its hardness and the nature of its surface; and it will vary, besides,\r\nwith the pressure exerted between the surfaces and the velocity of the\r\nmechanical action. We may say, then, that the wear resulting from rubbing\r\ntwo bodies against each other is a function of their degree of hardness,\r\nof the extent and state of their surface, of the pressure, of the\r\nvelocity, and of the time.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGS. 1, 2 and 3.--APPARATUS FOR SAWING STONE.]\r\n\r\nAccording as these factors are varied in a sense favorable or unfavorable\r\nto their proper action, we obtain variations in the final erosion. Thus,\r\nin rubbing together two bodies of different hardness and nature of\r\nsurface, we obtain a wear inversely proportional to the hardness and\r\nstate of polish of their surfaces. Through the interposition of a\r\npulverized hard body we can still further accelerate such wear, as a\r\nconsequence of the rapid renewal of the disintegrating element.\r\n\r\nThe gradual wear effected over the entire surface of a body brings about\r\na polish, while that effected along a line or at some one point\r\ndetermines a cleavage or an aperture.\r\n\r\nThe process usually employed in quarries or stone-yards for sawing\r\nconsists in slowly moving a stone-saw backward and forward, either by\r\nhand or machinery, and with scarcely any pressure. Mr. P. Gray has,\r\nhowever, devised a new process, which is based upon the theoretical\r\nconsiderations given above. His _helicoidal saw_ is, in reality, an\r\nendless cable formed by twisting together three steel wires in such a way\r\nas to give the spirals quite an elongated pitch.\r\n\r\nThe apparatus in its form for cutting blocks of stone into large slabs\r\n(Figs. 1, 2, and 3) consists of two frames, A A, five feet apart, each\r\nformed of two iron columns, 7½ feet in height and one foot apart, fixed\r\nto cast iron bases resting upon masonry. At the upper part, a frame, B B,\r\nformed of double T-irons cross-braced here and there, supports a\r\ntransmission composed of gearwheels, R R, and a pitch-chain, G G. Along\r\nthe columns of the frame, which serve as guides, move two kinds of\r\npulley-carriers, C C. The pulleys, D D, are channeled, and receive the\r\ncable, a a, which serves as a helicoidal saw. The direction of the saw's\r\nmotion is indicated by the arrow. The carriages, C C, are traversed by\r\nscrews, V V, which are fixed between the columns. The extremity, v, of\r\nthe axle of the pulley to the right is threaded, and actuates a\r\nhelicoidal wheel, E, which transmits motion to the wheel, R, through the\r\nintermedium of the vertical shaft, F. This transmission, completed by the\r\nwheels, R R, and the pitch-chains, G G, is designed to move the saw\r\nvertically, through the simultaneous shifting of the carriages, C C. A\r\ntension weight, P, through the intermedium of pulleys, D_{1} D_{1},\r\npermits of keeping the saw taut. A reservoir, H, at the upper part of the\r\nframe, B B, contains the water and sand necessary for sawing. The feeding\r\nis effected by means of a rubber tube, I, terminating in a flattened\r\nrose, J, which is situated over the aperture made by the saw. A small\r\npump, L. over the reservoir takes water from K, and raises it to H. The\r\nsand is put in by hand.\r\n\r\nAbove the basin, K, a system of rails and ties supports the carriage, Q,\r\nupon which is placed the block of stone to be sawn. When one operation\r\nhas been finished, and it is desired to begin another, it is necessary to\r\nraise the pulley-carriers and the saw. In order to do this quickly, there\r\nis provided a special transmission, M, which is actuated by hand, through\r\na winch.\r\n\r\nThe work done by this saw is effected more rapidly than by the ordinary\r\nprocesses, and certain very hard rocks, usually regarded as almost\r\nintractable, can be sawed at the rate of from one to one and a half\r\ninches per hour.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 4.--APPARATUS FOR SAWING STONE INTO SLABS.]\r\n\r\nFor sawing marble into slabs of all thicknesses, the arrangement\r\ndescribed above may be replaced by a system consisting of two drums\r\nhaving several channels to receive as many saws, or two corresponding\r\nseries of channeled pulleys, b b (Fig. 4), independent of each other, but\r\nkeyed to the same axles, i i. When the pulleys have been properly spaced\r\nby means of keys, the whole affair is rendered solid by a bolt, g. The\r\nextremity of the axles forms a nut into which pass vertical screws, c c.\r\nThese latter are connected above with cone-wheels, l l, which, gearing\r\nwith bevel wheels keyed to the shafts, e, secure a complete\r\ninterdependence of the whole. The ascending motion, which is controlled\r\nby the endless screws, f, and the helicoidal wheels, m, is in this way\r\neffected with great regularity. Uprights, a a, of double T-iron, fixed to\r\njoists, k k, and connected and braced by pieces, d d, form a strong\r\nframe.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 5.--APPLICATION OF GAY'S STONE SAW IN A MARBLE\r\nQUARRY.]\r\n\r\nThe power necessary to run this kind of saw is less than _n_ × ¼ H.P.,\r\non account of the number of passive parts. The most interesting\r\napplication of the helicoidal saw is in the exploitation of quarries.\r\nFig. 5 represents a Belgian marble quarry which is being worked by Mr.\r\nGay's method.\r\n\r\n_Tubular Perforators_.--Mr. Gay has rendered his saw completer by the\r\ninvention of a tubular perforator for drilling the preliminary well. It\r\nis based upon the same principle as the Leschot rotary drill, but differs\r\nfrom that in its extremity being simply of tempered steel instead of\r\nbeing set with black diamonds. A special product, called metallic\r\nagglomerate, is used instead of sand for hastening the work.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 6.--TUBULAR PERFORATOR.]\r\n\r\nThe apparatus, Fig. 6, consists of an iron plate cylinder, A, 27½\r\ninches in diameter, and of variable length, according to the depth to be\r\nobtained, and terminating beneath in a steel head, B, of greater\r\nthickness. This cylinder is traversed by a shaft, C, to which it is\r\nkeyed, and which passes through the center of the aperture drilled. This\r\nshaft is connected with the cylinder, A, through the intermedium of cross\r\nbars, D, and transmits thereto a rapid rotary motion, which is received\r\nat the upper part from a telodynamic wire that passes through the channel\r\nof the horizontal pulley, P.

Lewis,\r\nAberdare, lead mineral agent to the Marquis of Bute, and W.H. Massey,\r\nelectric light engineer to the Queen. Both these gentlemen, having been\r\nmembers of jury, were not allowed to compete for an award. The invention,\r\nsays _Engineering_, seems to possess considerable merit, and it should\r\nprove of practical utility in collieries where enginemen are usually kept\r\nwinding for many hours at a stretch, and where the slightest mistake on\r\nthe part of the driver may lead to an accident.\r\n\r\nSafety hooks are often fitted to winding ropes, and although the damage\r\nto life and property is greatly reduced by the use of them, they do not\r\nprotect a descending cage from injury in a case of overwinding; besides\r\nwhich, they are almost useless when a wild run takes place, an accident\r\nwhich, strange to say, has already occurred many times after engines and\r\nboilers have been laid off for repairs. Stop valves are left open, the\r\nreversing lever is not fixed in mid-gear, steam is got up in the boilers\r\nat a time when no one is in the engine house, and the engines run away.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LEWIS & MASSEY'S AUTOMATIC SAFETY GEAR.]\r\n\r\nVarious devices have been suggested and tried as a preventive, but their\r\napplication has either caused as much mischief as a bad accident, or it\r\nhas depended upon the driver doing something intentionally; whereas in\r\nthe automatic gear of Messrs. Massey and Lewis, of which an illustration\r\nis annexed, there is nothing to cause damage or to interfere in any way\r\nwith the proper handling of the engines, and it is practically out of the\r\npower of the driver to render the gear inoperative. It is here shown in\r\nits simplest form as applied to the ordinary reversing and steam handles\r\nof a winding engine, the only additions being an arm jointed to the top\r\nof the valve spindle, with its connections to the shaft of the reversing\r\nlever, and a disk receiving a suitable motion from the main shaft of the\r\nengine. On the disk is a projecting piece or stop which is brought into\r\nsuch positions, at or near the end of each journey, that the stop valve\r\ncannot be opened, except slightly, when the reversing lever is not set\r\nfor winding in the proper direction, or when the cages have reached a\r\npoint beyond which it is undesirable that the engine driver should have\r\nthe power of turning on full steam. Thus, if one cage is at bank, the\r\ndriver cannot draw it up into the head gear suddenly; but after it has\r\nbeen lifted slowly off the keeps or fangs, and the reversing lever thrown\r\nover, the stop valve can be lifted wide open; and supposing that while\r\nthe engine is running the driver neglects to shut off steam in proper\r\ntime, then the projecting piece on the disk in traveling round, slowly\r\nor quickly, and by steps according to requirements, will come in contact\r\nwith the driver, and so prevent an accident by bringing the reversing\r\nlever into or beyond mid-gear.\r\n\r\nMessrs. Lewis and Massey contemplate the use of governors in combination\r\nwith various forms of their automatic gear, so as to provide for every\r\nimaginable case of winding, and also to avoid accidents when heavy loads\r\nare sent down a pit; the special feature in their mechanism being that\r\nwhen two or more things happen with regard to the positions of steam or\r\nreversing handles, speed or position of cages in the pit, whatever it may\r\nbe necessary to do to meet the particular case shall be done\r\nautomatically.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE WATER SUPPLY OF ANCIENT ROMAN CITIES.\r\n\r\n[Footnote: An address by Prof. W.H. Corfield, M.D., M.A., delivered\r\nbefore the Sanitary Institute of Great Britain, July 9, 1885.--_Building\r\nNews_.]\r\n\r\n\r\nAs the supply of water to large populations is one of the most important\r\nsubjects in connection with sanitary matters, and one upon which the\r\nhealth of the populations to a very large extent depends, I propose to\r\ngive a short account of some of the more important works carried out for\r\nthis purpose by the ancient Romans--the great sanitary engineers of\r\nantiquity--more especially as I have had exceptional opportunities of\r\nexamining many of those great works in Italy, in France, and along the\r\nnorth coast of Africa. Of the aqueducts constructed for the supply of\r\nRome itself we have an excellent detailed account in the work of\r\nFrontinus, who was the controller of the aqueducts under the emperor\r\nNerva, and who wrote his admirable work on them about A.D. 97.\r\n\r\nIt may be interesting in passing to mention that Frontinus was a\r\npatrician, who had commanded with distinction in Britain under the\r\nemperor Vespasian, before he was appointed by the emperor Nerva as\r\ncontroller (or, we should say, surveyor) of the aqueducts. He was also an\r\nantiquarian, and in his work he not only describes the aqueducts as they\r\nwere in this time, but also gives a very interesting history of them. He\r\nbegins by telling us that for 441 years after the building of the\r\ncity--that is to say, B.C. 312--there was no systematic supply of water\r\nto the city; that the water was got direct from the Tiber, from shallow\r\nwells, and from natural springs; but that these sources were found no\r\nlonger to be sufficient, and the construction of the first aqueduct was\r\nundertaken during the consulship of Appius Claudius Crassus, from whom it\r\ntook the name of the Appian aqueduct. This was, as may be expected from\r\nits being the first aqueduct, not a very long one; the source was about\r\neight miles to the east of Rome, and the length of the aqueduct itself\r\nrather more than eleven miles, according to Mr. James Parker, to whose\r\npaper on the \"Water Supply of Ancient Rome\" I am indebted for many of the\r\nfacts concerning the aqueducts of Rome itself. This aqueduct was carried\r\nunderground throughout its whole length, winding round the heads of the\r\nvalleys in its course, and not crossing them, supported on arches, after\r\nthe manner of more recent constructions; it was thus invisible until it\r\ngot inside the city itself, a very important matter when we consider how\r\nliable Rome was, in these early times, to hostile attacks.\r\n\r\nIt was soon found that more water was required than was brought by this\r\naqueduct, and it was no doubt considered desirable to have tanks at a\r\nhigher level in the city than those supplied by the Appian aqueduct. It\r\nwas determined, therefore, to bring water from a greater height, and from\r\na greater distance, and the river Anio, above the falls at Tivoli, was\r\nselected for this purpose. The second aqueduct, the Anio Vetus, was no\r\nless than 42 miles in length, and was, like the Appian, entirely under\r\nthe surface of the ground, except at its entrance into Rome at a point\r\nabout 60 ft. higher than the level of the Appian aqueduct.\r\n\r\nLittle search has been made for the remains of this aqueduct, and its\r\nexact course is not known; but during my examination of the remains of\r\nthe subsequent aqueducts at a place called the Porta Furba, near Rome,\r\nwhere the ruins of five aqueducts are seen together, and at, or close to,\r\nwhich point the Anio Vetus must also have passed underground, I was\r\nrewarded for my search by discovering a hole, something like a fox's\r\nhole, leading into the ground; and on clearing away a few loose stones\r\nwhich had apparently been thrown into it, and putting my arm in, I found\r\nthat it led into the specus or channel of an underground aqueduct; and on\r\nrelating this incident to the late Mr. John Henry Parker, the\r\nantiquarian, who was then in Rome, and showing him a sketch of the place,\r\nhe said that he had no doubt that I had been fortunate enough to discover\r\nthe exact position of the veritable Anio Vetus at that spot. These two\r\naqueducts sufficed for the supply of Rome with water for about 120 years,\r\nfor Frontinus tells us that 127 years after the date at which the\r\nconstruction of the Anio Vetus was undertaken--that is to say, the 608th\r\nyear after the foundation of the city--the increase of the city\r\nnecessitated a more ample supply of water, and it was determined to bring\r\nit from a still greater distance. It was no longer considered necessary\r\nto conceal the aqueduct underground during the whole of its course, and\r\nso it was in part carried above ground on embankments or supported upon\r\narches of masonry. The water was brought from some pools in one of the\r\nvalleys on the eastern side of the Anio, some miles farther up than the\r\npoint from which the Anio Vetus was supplied; and the new aqueduct, which\r\nwas 54 miles in length, was called the Marcian, after the Prætor Marcius,\r\nto whom the work was intrusted. Frontinus also tells us the history of\r\nthe other six aqueducts which were in existence in his time, viz., the\r\nTepulan, the Julian, the Virgo, the Alsietine or Augustan, the Claudian,\r\nand the Anio Novus; the last two being commenced by the Emperor Caligula,\r\nand finished by Claudius, because \"seven aqueducts seemed scarcely\r\nsufficient for public purposes and private amusements;\" but it is not\r\nnecessary for our purpose to give any detailed account of the course of\r\nthese aqueducts; it is only necessary to mention one or two very\r\ninteresting points in connection with them. In order to allow of the\r\ndeposit of suspended matters, piscinæ, or settling reservoirs, were\r\nconstructed in a very ingenious manner. Each had four compartments, two\r\nupper and two lower; the water was conducted into one of the upper\r\ncompartments, and from this passed, probably by what we should call a\r\nstanding waste or overflow pipe, into the one below; from this it passed\r\n(probably through a grating) into the third compartment at the same\r\nlevel, and thence rose through a hole in the roof of this compartment\r\ninto the fourth, which was above it, and in which the water, of course,\r\nattained the same level as in the first compartment, thence passing on\r\nalong the aqueduct, having deposited a good deal of its suspended matter\r\nin the two lower compartments of the piscinæ. Arrangements were made by\r\nwhich these two lower compartments should be cleaned out from time to\r\ntime. The specus or channel itself was, of course, constructed of\r\nmasonry, generally of blocks of stone cemented together, and it was\r\nfrequently, though not, it would appear always, lined with cement inside.\r\nIt was roofed over, and ventilating shafts were constructed at intervals;\r\nin order to encourage the aeration of the water, irregularities were\r\noccasionally introduced in the bed of the channel. The water supplied by\r\nthe different aqueducts was of various qualities; thus, for instance,\r\nthat of the Alsietine, which was taken from a lake about 18 miles from\r\nRome, was of an inferior quality, and was chiefly used to supply a large\r\nnaumachia, or reservoir, in which imitation sea fights were performed;\r\nwhile, on the other hand, the water of the Marcian was very clear and\r\ngood, and was therefore used for domestic purposes. Frontinus gives the\r\nmost accurate details as to the measurements of the amount of water\r\nsupplied by the various aqueducts, and the quantities used for different\r\npurposes. From these details Mr. Parker computes the sectional area of\r\nthe water at about 120 square feet, and says: \"We can form some opinion\r\nof the vast quantity if we picture to ourselves a stream 20 ft. wide by 6\r\nft. deep constantly pouring into Rome at a fall six times as rapid as\r\nthat of the river Thames.\" He considers that the amount was equivalent to\r\nabout 332 million gallons a day, or 332 gallons per head per day,\r\nassuming the population of the city to be a million. When we consider\r\nthat we in London have only 30 gallons a head daily, and that many other\r\ntowns have less, we get some idea of the profusion with which water was\r\nsupplied to ancient Rome. But the remains of Roman aqueducts are not only\r\nto be found near Rome. Almost every Roman city, whether in Italy or in\r\nthe south of France, or along the north coast of Africa, can show the\r\nremains of its aqueduct, and almost the only things that are to be seen\r\non the site of Carthage are the remains of the Roman water tanks and the\r\nruins of the aqueduct which supplied them. The most beautiful aqueduct\r\nbridge in the world, on the course of the aqueduct which supplied the\r\nancient Nemaucus, now Nismes, still stands, and is called, from the name\r\nof the department in which it is, the Pont du Gard. It consists of a row\r\nof large arches crossing the valley over which the water had to be\r\ncarried, surmounted by a series of smaller arches, and these again by a\r\nseries of still smaller ones, carrying the specus of the aqueduct. This\r\nsplendid bridge still stands perfect, so that one can walk through the\r\nchannel along which the water flowed, and it might be again used for its\r\noriginal purpose. There was, however, one city which, from the fact that\r\na great part of it was situated upon a hill, was more difficult to supply\r\nwith water than any of the rest, and which, at the same time, from its\r\nsize, its great importance, and the fact that it was the favorite summer\r\nresidence of several of the Roman emperors, and notably of Claudius, who\r\nwas born there, and who had a palace on the top of the hill, must of\r\nnecessity be supplied with plenty of water, and that too from a\r\nconsiderable height. I refer to Ludgunum (now Lyons), then the capital of\r\nSouthern Gaul. This city was built by Lucius Munatius Plaucus, by order\r\nof the Senate in A.U.C. 711. Augustus went there in A.U.C. 738, and\r\nafterward lived there from 741 to 744. It was he who raised it to a very\r\nhigh rank among Roman cities. It had its forum near the top of the hill\r\nnow called Fourvieres (probably a corruption of Forum Vetus), an imperial\r\nplace on the summit of the same hill, public baths, an amphitheater, a\r\ncircus, and temples.\r\n\r\nIn order to supply this city with water, standing as it did on the side\r\nof a hill at the junction of two great rivers (now Rhone and Saone), it\r\nwas necessary to search for a source at a sufficient height, and this\r\nPlaucus found in the hills of Mont d'Or, near Lyons, where a plentiful\r\nsupply of water was found at a sufficient height, viz., that of nearly\r\n2,000 ft. above the sea. From this point an aqueduct, sometimes called\r\nfrom its source the aqueduct of Mont d'Or, and sometimes the aqueduct of\r\nEcully, from the name of a large plain which it crossed, was constructed,\r\nor rather two subterranean aqueducts were made and joined together into\r\none, which crossed the plain of Ecully, in a straight line still\r\nunderground; but the ground around Lyons was not like the Campagna, near\r\nRome, and it was necessary to cross the broad and deep valley now called\r\nLa Grange, Blanche. This, however, did not daunt the Roman engineers;\r\nmaking the aqueduct end in a reservoir on one side of the valley, they\r\ncarried the water down into the valley, probably by means of lead pipes,\r\nin the manner which will be described more at length further on, across\r\nthe stream at the bottom of the valley by means of an aqueduct bridge 650\r\nft. long, 75 ft. high, and 28½ ft. broad, and up the other side into\r\nanother reservoir, from which the aqueduct was continued along the top of\r\na long series of arches to the reservoir in the city, after a course of\r\nabout ten miles.\r\n\r\nIn the time of Augustus, however, it was found that the water brought by\r\nthis aqueduct was not sufficient, especially in summer; and as there was\r\na large Roman camp which also required to be supplied with water,\r\nsituated at a short distance from the city, it was determined to\r\nconstruct a second aqueduct. For this purpose the springs at the head of\r\na small river, called now the Brevenne, were tapped, and conveyed by\r\nmeans of an underground aqueduct (known as the aqueduct of the Brevenne)\r\nwhich wound round the heads of the valleys, and after a course of about\r\nthirty miles is believed by some to have arrived at the city, but by\r\nothers to have stopped at the Roman camp, and to have been constructed\r\nexclusively for its supply.\r\n\r\nI have here a diagram, after Flacheron, showing a section of this\r\naqueduct, and this will give a very good general idea of the section of a\r\nRoman aqueduct where constructed underground. It will be seen that the\r\nspecus or channel is 60 centimeters (or nearly 2 ft.) wide, and 1m. 57c.\r\n(or a little over 5 ft.) high, and that it is lined with a layer of 3 c.\r\n(or nearly 1¼ in.) of cement. It is constructed of quadrangular blocks of\r\nstone cemented together, and has an arched stone roof. It will be noticed\r\nalso that the angles at the lower part of the channel are filled up with\r\ncement; it appears also that this aqueduct crossed a small valley by\r\nmeans of inverted siphons. But neither of these aqueducts came from a\r\nsource sufficiently high to supply the imperial palace on the top of\r\nFourvieres.\r\n\r\nTheir sources are, in fact, according to Flacheron, at a height of nearly\r\n50 ft. below the summit of Fourvieres, and it was, therefore, considered\r\nnecessary by the emperor Claudius to construct a third aqueduct. The\r\nsources of the stream now called the Gier, at the foot of Mont Pila,\r\nabout a mile and a half above St. Chamond, were chosen for this purpose,\r\nand from this point to the summit of Fourvieres was constructed by far\r\nthe most remarkable aqueduct of ancient times, an engineering work which,\r\nas will be seen from the following description, partly taken from\r\nMontfalcon's history of Lyons, partly from Flacheron's account of this\r\naqueduct, and partly from my own observations on the spot, reflects the\r\ngreatest possible credit on the Roman engineers, and shows that they were\r\nnot, as has been frequently supposed by those who have only examined\r\naqueducts at Rome, by any means ignorant of the elementary principles of\r\nhydraulics.\r\n\r\nTo tap the sources of a river at a point over 50 miles from the city, and\r\nto bring the water across a most irregular country, crossing ten or\r\ntwelve valleys, one being over 300 ft. deep, and about two-thirds of a\r\nmile in width, was no easy task; but that it was performed the remains of\r\nthe aqueduct at various parts of its course show clearly enough. It\r\ncommences, as I have said, about a mile and a half from the present St.\r\nChamond, a town on the river Gier, about 16 miles from St. Etienne. Here\r\na dam appears to have been constructed across the bed of the river,\r\nforming a lake from which the water entered the channel of the aqueduct,\r\nwhich passed along underground until it came to a small stream which it\r\ncrossed by a bridge, long since destroyed.\r\n\r\nAfter this it again became subterraneous for a time, and then crossed\r\nanother stream on a bridge of nine arches, the ruins of some of the\r\ncolumns of which are still to be seen; and from these ruins it would\r\nappear that the bridge had, at some time or another, been destroyed,\r\nprobably by the stream running under it having become torrential, and\r\nsubsequently rebuilt; again it became concealed underground, to reappear\r\nin crossing a small valley and another small stream, when it was again\r\nconcealed by the ground, and in one or two places channels were even cut\r\nfor it through the solid rock, after which it reappeared on the surface\r\nat a point where now stands the village of Terre-Noire, and where it was\r\nnecessary that it should somehow or another cross a broad and deep\r\nvalley. It ended in a stone reservoir, from which eight lead pipes\r\ndescending into the valley were carried across the stream at the bottom\r\non an aqueduct bridge, about 25 ft. wide, and supported by twelve or\r\nthirteen arches, and then mounted the other side of the valley into\r\nanother reservoir, of which scarcely any remains are now seen, from which\r\nthe aqueduct started again, disappearing almost immediately under the\r\nsurface of the ground, to appear again from time to time crossing similar\r\nvalleys and streams upon bridges, the remains of some of which may still\r\nbe seen, until it reached Soucieu, on the edge of the valley of the\r\nGaronne, where are still seen the remains of a splendid bridge, the\r\nthirteenth on its course, nearly 1,600 ft. long, and attaining a height\r\nof 56 ft. at its highest point above the ground. The object of this\r\nbridge was to convey the channel of the aqueduct at a sufficient height\r\ninto a reservoir on the edge of the valley.\r\n\r\nThe remains of this bridge leave no doubt that it was purposely destroyed\r\nby barbarians; some of the arches near the end of it remain, while the\r\nrest have been thrown down, some on one side and some on the other; but\r\nhappily the arches next to the reservoir, at the end of the bridge and on\r\nthe edge of the valley, remain, and the reservoir itself is still in part\r\nintact, supported on a huge mass of masonry. Four holes are to be seen in\r\nthat part of the front of the reservoir which is left, being the holes\r\nfrom which the lead pipes descended into the valley. There must have been\r\nnine of these pipes in all. These holes are elliptical in shape, being 12\r\nin. high by 9½ in. wide, and the interior of the reservoir is still seen\r\nto be covered with cement. The walls of the reservoir were about 2 ft. 7\r\nin. thick, and were strengthened by ties of iron; it had an arched stone\r\nroof in which there was an opening for access. From this the nine lead\r\npipes descended the side of the valley supported on a construction of\r\nmasonry, crossed the river by an aqueduct bridge, and ascended into\r\nanother reservoir on the other side, entering the reservoir at its upper\r\npart just below the spring of the arches of the roof. From this reservoir\r\nthe aqueduct passed to the next on the edge of the large and deep valley\r\nof Bonnan, being underground twice and having three bridges on its\r\ncourse, the last of which, the sixteenth on the course of the aqueduct,\r\nends in a reservoir on the edge of the valley. Only one of the openings\r\nby which the siphons, of which there were probably ten, started from the\r\nreservoir is now left. The bridge across the valley below had thirty\r\narches, and was about 880 ft. long by 24 ft. wide.\r\n\r\nA number of the arches still remain standing, and, the pillars of the\r\narches were constructed of transverse arches themselves. The work\r\nconsisted of concrete, formed with Roman cement so hard that it turns the\r\npoints of pickaxes when employed against it, with layers of tiles at\r\nregular intervals. The surface of the concrete is covered with small\r\ncubical blocks of stone placed so that their diagonals are horizontal and\r\nvertical, and forming what is known as _opus reticulatum_. After crossing\r\nthe bridge the pipes were carried up the other side of the valley into a\r\nreservoir, of which little remains, and then the aqueduct was continued\r\nto the next valley, passing over three bridges in its course. This\r\nvalley, that of St. Irenée, is much smaller than either of the others,\r\nbut nevertheless it was deep enough to necessitate the construction of\r\ninverted siphons, of which there were eight. Leaving the reservoir on the\r\nother side of this valley, the aqueduct was carried on a long bridge (the\r\ntwentieth on its course) which crossed the plateau on the top of\r\nFourvieres and opened into a large reservoir, the remains of which are\r\nstill to be seen on the top of that hill.\r\n\r\nFrom this reservoir, which was 77 ft. long and 51 ft. wide, pipes of lead\r\nconveyed the water to the imperial palace and to the other buildings near\r\nthe top of the hill. Some of these lead pipes were found in a vineyard\r\nnear the top of Fourvieres at the beginning of the eighteenth century,\r\nand were described by Colonia in his history of Lyons. They are made of\r\nthick sheet lead rolled round so as to form a tube, with the edges of the\r\nsheet turned upward, and applied to one another in such a way as to leave\r\na small space, which was probably filled with some kind of cement. These\r\npipes, of which it is said that twenty or thirty, each from 15 ft. to 20\r\nft. long, were found, were marked with the initial letters TI. CL. CAES.\r\n(Tiberius Claudius Cæsar), and afford positive evidence that the work was\r\ncarried out under the emperor Claudius. Lead pipes, constructed in a\r\nsimilar manner, have also been found at Bath, in this country, in\r\nconnection with the Roman baths. The great difference between this\r\naqueduct and those near Rome arises from the fact that, instead of being\r\ncarried across a nearly flat country, it was carried across one\r\nintersected with deep ravines, and that it was therefore necessary to\r\nhave recourse to the system of inverted siphons. There can be no doubt\r\nthat the inverted siphons were made of lead, although no remains of them\r\nhave been found; for we know that the Romans used lead largely, and, as\r\nwe have seen, pieces of the lead distribution pipes have been found. It\r\nis possible, and even likely, that strong cords of hemp were wound round\r\nthe pipes forming the siphons, as is related by Delorme in describing a\r\nsimilar Roman aqueduct siphon near Constantinople; Delorme also\r\ndescribes, in the aqueduct last mentioned, a pipe for the escape of air\r\nfrom the lowest part of the siphon carried up against a tower, which was\r\nhigher than the aqueduct, and it is certain that there must have been\r\nsome such contrivance on the siphons of the aqueduct constructed at\r\nLyons.\r\n\r\nFlacheron supposes that they consisted of small pipes carried from the\r\nlowest part of the siphons up along the side of the valley and above the\r\nreservoirs, or, in some instances, of taps fixed at the lowest part of\r\nthe siphons. The Romans have been blamed for not using inverted siphons\r\nin the aqueducts at Rome, and it has been said that this is a sufficient\r\nproof that they did not understand the simplest principles of hydraulics,\r\nbut the remains of the aqueducts at Lyons negative this assumption\r\naltogether. The Romans were not so foolish as to construct underground\r\nsiphons, many miles long, for the supply of Rome; but where it was\r\nnecessary to construct them for the purpose of crossing deep valleys,\r\nthey did so. The same emperor Claudius who built the aqueduct at Rome\r\nknown by his name built the aqueduct of Mont Pila, at Lyons, and it is\r\nquite clear, therefore, that his engineers were practically well\r\nacquainted with the principles of hydraulics. It is thus seen that the\r\nancient Romans spared no pains to obtain a supply of pure water for their\r\ncities, and I think it is high time that we followed their example, and\r\nwent to the trouble and expense of obtaining drinking water from\r\nunimpeachable sources, instead of, as is too often the case, taking\r\nwater which we know perfectly well has been polluted, and then attempting\r\nto purify it for domestic purposes.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSTEAM ENGINE ECONOMY.\r\n\r\nBy Chief Engineer JOHN LOWE, U.S. Navy.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe purpose of this article is to point out an easy method whereby any\r\nintelligent engineer can determine the point at which it is most\r\neconomical to cut off the admission of steam into his cylinder.\r\n\r\nIn the attack upon such a problem, it is useful to employ all the senses\r\nwhich can be brought to bear upon it; for this purpose, diagrams will be\r\nused, in order that the sense of sight may assist the brain in forming\r\nits conclusions.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: STEAM ENGINE ECONOMY.--BY JOHN LOWE, CHIEF ENGINEER\r\nU.S.N.]\r\n\r\nFig. XABCX is an ideal indicator card, taken from a cylinder, imagined to\r\nbe 600 feet long, in which the piston, making one stroke per minute, has\r\ntherefore a piston speed of 600 feet per minute. Divide this card into\r\nany convenient number of ordinates, distant _dx_ feet from each other,\r\nwriting upon each the absolute pressure measured upon it from the zero\r\nline XX.\r\n\r\nBy way of example, let the diameter of the cylinder be 29.59 inches, and\r\nlet the back pressure from all causes be 7 pounds uniformly throughout.\r\nIt will be represented by the line b_{1}, b_{2}, etc. This quantity\r\nsubtracted from the pressures p_{1}, p_{2}, etc., leaves the remainder\r\n(p-b) upon each ordinate, which remainder represents the net pressures\r\nwhich at that point may be applied to produce external power.\r\n\r\nIf, now, A is the area of the piston, then the external power (d W)\r\nproduced between each ordinate is:\r\n\r\nTo any convenient scale, upon each ordinate, set off the appropriate\r\npower as calculated by this equation (1).\r\n\r\n        A(p-b)dx\r\ndW = --------------. (1.)\r\n         33,000\r\n\r\nThere will result the curve _w, w, w_, determining the power which at any\r\npoint in the diagram is to be regarded as a gain, to be carried to the\r\ncredit side of the account.\r\n\r\nIt is evident that, so long as the gains from expansion exceed the losses\r\nfrom expansion, it is profitable to proceed with expansion, but that\r\nexpansion should cease at that point at which gains and losses just\r\nbalance each other.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO CALCULATE THE LOSSES.\r\n\r\nThe requisite data are furnished by the experiments conducted some years\r\nsince by President D.M. Greene, of Troy College, for the Bureau of Steam\r\nEngineering, U.S. Navy.\r\n\r\nAccording to these experiments, the heat which is lost per hour by\r\nradiation through a metallic plate of ordinary thickness, exposed to dry\r\nair upon one side and to the source of heat upon the other, for one\r\ndegree difference in temperature, is as follows:\r\n\r\n             Condition.

(2)\r\n       60     33,000\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the same scale as the power gains, upon each ordinate, set off the\r\nappropriate power loss, as calculated by this equation (2).\r\n\r\nThere will result the curve r, r, r, which determines the power which at\r\nany point in the diagram is to be regarded as a loss, to be carried to\r\nthe debit side of the account. This curve of losses intersects the curve\r\nof gains at a point (it is evident) where each equals the other.\r\n\r\nTherefore this is the point at which expansion should cease, and this\r\nabsolute pressure is the economic terminal pressure, which determines the\r\nnumber of expansions profitable under the given conditions.\r\n\r\nIn the foregoing example are taken k = 0.3070554, t' = 331.169, t = 60,\r\nwhile the back pressure was taken at 7 pounds.\r\n\r\nBy way of further illustration, first let the back pressure be changed\r\nfrom 7 to 5.\r\n\r\nBy equation 1 there will result a new curve of gains, W, W, W, a portion\r\nonly being plotted.\r\n\r\nSecond, let t' = 331.169 as before.\r\n            t  = 150 instead of 60.\r\n            k  = 0.2507097 instead of 0.3070554.\r\n\r\nThere will result the second curve of losses, R, R, R, intersecting the\r\nsecond curve of gains at the point F, the new economic point for our new\r\nconditions.\r\n\r\nThese two examples fully illustrate the whole subject, furnishing an easy\r\nand, when carefully made, a very exact calculation and result.\r\n\r\nThe following are a few of the general conclusions to be drawn:\r\n\r\n1. That radiation is a tangible and measurable cause, sufficient to\r\naccount for all losses heretofore ascribed to an intangible,\r\nimmeasurable, and wholly imaginary cause, viz., \"internal evaporation and\r\nre-evaporation.\"\r\n\r\n2. In order to prevent the high initial temperatures now used becoming a\r\nsource of loss, it is necessary to prevent the quantity dS (t'-t)\r\nbecoming great, by making dS as small as possible. In other words, we\r\nmust compound our engines. Thus for the first time is pointed out the\r\ntrue reason why compound engines are economical heat engines.\r\n\r\n3. The foregoing reasoning being correct, it follows that steam jackets\r\nare a delusion.\r\n\r\n4. In order to attain economy, we must have high initial temperatures,\r\nsmall high pressure cylinders, low back pressures from whatsoever cause,\r\nhigh piston speeds, short rather than long strokes, to avoid the cooling\r\neffects of a long piston rod; but especially must we have scrupulous and\r\nperfect protection from radiation, especially about the cylinder heads,\r\nnow oftentimes left bare.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nELECTRICITY IN WARFARE.\r\n\r\n[Footnote: From a recent lecture before the Franklin Institute,\r\nPhiladelphia.]\r\n\r\nBy Lieut. B.A. FISKE, U.S.N.\r\n\r\n\r\nLieutenant Fiske began by paying a tribute to the remarkable pioneer\r\nefforts of Colonel Samuel Colt, who more than forty years ago blew up\r\nseveral old vessels, including the gunboat Boxer and the Volta, by the\r\nuse of electricity. Congress voted Colt $17,000 for continuing his\r\nexperiments, which at that day seemed almost magical; and he then blew up\r\na vessel in motion at a distance of five miles. Lieut. Fiske next\r\nreferred briefly to the electrical torpedoes employed in the Crimean war\r\nand our civil war.\r\n\r\nAt the present day, an electrical torpedo may be described as consisting\r\nof a strong, water-tight vessel of iron or steel, which contains a large\r\namount of some explosive, usually gun-cotton, and a device for detonating\r\nthis explosive by electricity. The old mechanical mine used in our civil\r\nwar did not know a friendly ship from a hostile one, and would sink\r\neither with absolute impartiality. But the electrical submarine mine,\r\nbeing exploded only when a current of electricity is sent through it from\r\nship or shore, makes no such mistake, and becomes harmless when detached\r\nfrom the battery. The condition of the mine at any time can also be told\r\nby sending a very minute current through it, though miles away and buried\r\ndeep beneath the sea.\r\n\r\nWhen a current of electricity goes through a wire, it heats it; and if\r\nthe current be made strong enough, and a white hot wire thus comes in\r\ncontact with powder or fulminate of mercury in a torpedo, an explosion\r\nwill result. But it is important to know exactly when to explode the\r\ntorpedo, especially during the night or in a fog; and hence torpedoes are\r\noften made automatic by what is called a circuit closer. This is a device\r\nwhich automatically bridges over the distance between two points which\r\nwere separated, thus allowing the current to pass between them. In\r\nsubmarine torpedoes it is usual to employ a small weight, which, when the\r\ntorpedo is struck, is thrown by the force of the blow across two contact\r\npoints, one of which points is in connection with the fuse and the other\r\nin connection with the battery, so that the current immediately runs over\r\nthe bridge thus offered, and through the fuse. In practice, these two\r\ncontact points are connected by a wire, even when the torpedo is not in\r\nthe state of being struck; but the wire is of such great resistance that\r\nthe current is too weak to heat the wire in the fuse. Yet when the weight\r\nabove mentioned is thrown across the two contact points, the current runs\r\nacross the bridge, instead of through the resistance wire, and is then\r\nstrong enough to heat the wire in the fuse and explode the torpedo. The\r\nadvantage of having a wire of high resistance between the contact points,\r\ninstead of having no wire between them, is that the current which then\r\npasses through the fuse, though too weak to fire it, shows by its very\r\nexistence to the men on shore that the circuit through the torpedo is all\r\nright.\r\n\r\nBut instead of having the increased current caused by striking the\r\ntorpedo to fire the torpedo directly, a better way is to have it simply\r\nmake a signal on shore. Then, when friendly vessels are to pass, the\r\nfiring battery can be disconnected; and when the friendly ship bumps the\r\ntorpedo, the working of the signal shows not only that the circuit\r\nthrough the fuse is all right, but also that the circuit closer is all\r\nright, so that, had the friendly ship been a hostile ship, she would\r\ncertainly have been destroyed.\r\n\r\nWhile the management of the torpedo is thus simple, the defense of a\r\nharbor becomes a complex problem, on account of the time and expense\r\nrequired to perfect it, and the training of a corps of men to operate the\r\ntorpedoes.\r\n\r\nIn order to detect the presence of torpedoes in an enemy's harbor, an\r\ninstrument has been invented by Capt. McEvoy, called the \"torpedo\r\ndetecter,\" in which the action is somewhat similar to that of the\r\ninduction balance, the iron of a torpedo case having the effect of\r\nincreasing the number of lines of force embraced by one of two opposing\r\ncoils, so that the current induced in it overpowers that induced in the\r\nother, and a distinct sound is heard in a telephone receiver in circuit\r\nwith them. As yet, this instrument has met with little practical success,\r\nbut, its principle being correct, we can say with considerable confidence\r\nthat the reason of its non-success probably is that the coils and current\r\nused are both too small.\r\n\r\nLieut. Fiske described the spar torpedo and the various classes of\r\nmovable torpedoes, including the Lay. His conclusion is that the most\r\nsuccessful of the movable torpedoes is the Simms, with which very\r\npromising experiments have been conducted under the superintendence of\r\nGen. Abbot.\r\n\r\nRecent experiments in England have shown that the Whitehead torpedo, over\r\nwhich control ceases after it is fired, is not so formidable a weapon\r\nwhen fired at a ship _under way_ as many supposed, for the simple reason\r\nthat it can be dodged. But an electrical torpedo, over which control is\r\nexercised while it is in motion through the water, cannot be dodged,\r\nprovided it receives sufficient speed. For effective work against ships\r\ncapable of steaming fifteen knots per hour, the torpedo should have a\r\nspeed of twenty knots. There is no theoretical difficulty in the way of\r\nproducing this, for a speed of eleven knots has already been recorded,\r\nthough an electric torpedo, to get this speed, would have to be larger\r\nthan a Whitehead having the same speed. It may be conceived that a\r\ntorpedo carrying 50 lb. of gun-cotton, capable of going 20 knots per\r\nhour, so that it would pass over a distance of 500 yards in about 45\r\nsec., and yet be absolutely under control all the time, so that it can be\r\nconstantly kept pointed at its target, would be a very unpleasant thing\r\nfor an enemy to meet.\r\n\r\nMilitary telegraphy is a second use of electricity in warfare. Lieut.\r\nFiske traces its origin to our own civil war. Foreign nations took the\r\nhint from us, and during the invasion of France the telegraph played a\r\nmost important part. In military telegraph trains, miles of wire are\r\ncarried on reels in specially constructed wagons, which hold also\r\nbatteries and instruments. Some of the wire is insulated, so that it can\r\nrest on the ground, and thus be laid out with great speed, while other\r\nwire is bare, and is intended to be put on poles, trees, etc. For\r\nmountain service the wires and implements are carried by pack animals.\r\nRegularly trained men are employed, and are drilled in quickly running\r\nlines, setting up temporary stations, etc. In the recent English\r\noperations in Egypt, the advance guard always kept in telegraphic\r\ncommunication with headquarters and with England, and after the battle of\r\nTel-el-Kebir news of the victory was telegraphed to the Queen and her\r\nanswer received in forty-five minutes.\r\n\r\nThe telephone is also used with success in warfare, and in fact sometimes\r\nassists the telegraph in cases where, by reason of the haste with which a\r\nline has been run, the current leaks off. A telephone may then be used to\r\nreceive the message--and for a transmitter a simple buzzer or automatic\r\ncircuit breaker, controlled by an ordinary key. In the case of vessels\r\nthere is much difficulty in using the telegraph and the telephone, as the\r\nwire may be fouled and broken when the ship swings by a long chain. In\r\nEngland in the case of a lightship this difficulty has been surmounted,\r\nor rather avoided, by making hollow the cable by which the ship rides,\r\nand running an insulated wire along the long tube thus formed inside. But\r\nthe problem is much simplified when temporary communication only is\r\ndesired between ships at anchor, between a ship and the shore, or even\r\nbetween a ship and a boat which has been sent off on some special\r\nservice, such as reconnoitering, sounding, etc. In this case portable\r\ntelephones are used, in which the wire is so placed on a reel in circuit\r\nwith the telephone that communication is preserved, even while the wire\r\nis running off the reel.\r\n\r\nThe telegraph and telephone are both coming largely into use in artillery\r\nexperiments, for example, in tracking a vessel as she comes up a channel\r\nso that her exact position at each instant may be known, and in\r\ndetermining the spot of fall of a projectile. In getting the time of\r\nflight of projectiles electricity is of value; by breaking a wire in\r\ncircuit with a chronograph, the precise instant of start to within a\r\nthousandth of a second being automatically registered. Velocimeters are a\r\nfamiliar application of electricity somewhat analogous. In these, wires\r\nare cut by the projectile at different points in its flight, and the\r\nbreaking of the electric current causes the appearance of marks on a\r\nsurface moving along at a known speed. The velocity of the projectile in\r\ngoing from one wire to another can then be found.\r\n\r\nElectricity is also used for firing great guns, both in ships and forts.\r\nIn the former, it eliminates the factor of change produced by the rolling\r\nof the ship during the movement of the arm to fire the gun. The touch of\r\na button accomplishes the same thing almost instantaneously. Moreover, an\r\nabsolutely simultaneous broadside can be delivered by electricity. The\r\nofficer discharges the guns from a fighting tower, whither the wires\r\nlead, and the men can at once lie down out of the enemy's machine guns,\r\nas soon as their own guns are ready for discharge. The electric motor\r\nwill certainly be used very generally for handling ordnance on board\r\nships not very heavily plated with armor, since a small wire is a much\r\nmore convenient mode of conveying energy to a motor of any kind, and is\r\nmuch less liable to injury, than a comparatively large pipe for conveying\r\nsteam, compressed air, or water under pressure. Besides, the electric\r\nmotor is the ideal engine for work on shipboard, by reason of its smooth\r\nand silent motion, its freedom from dirt and grease, the readiness with\r\nwhich it can be started, stopped, and reversed, and its high efficiency.\r\nIndeed, in future we may look to a protected apparatus for all such uses\r\nin every fort and every powerful ship.\r\n\r\nIn photographing the bores of great guns, electric lights are used, and\r\nthey make known if the gun is accurately rifled and how it is standing\r\nthe erosion of the powder gases.\r\n\r\nIn the case of a fort, electricity can be employed in connection with the\r\ninstruments used for determining at each instant the position of an\r\napproaching vessel or army. Whitehead torpedoes are now so arranged that\r\nthey can be ejected by pressing an electric button.\r\n\r\nElectric lights for vessels are now of recognized importance. At first\r\nthey were objected to on the ground that if the wire carrying the current\r\nshould be shot away in action, the whole ship would be plunged in\r\ndarkness; and so it would be in an accident befalling the dynamo that\r\ngenerates the current. The criticism is sensible, but the answer is that\r\ndifferent circuits must be arranged for different parts of the ship, and\r\nthe wires carrying the current must be arranged in duplicate. It is also\r\neasy to repair a break in a copper wire if shot away. As to the dynamo\r\nand engines, they must be placed below the water line, under a protective\r\ndeck, and this should be provided for in building the vessel. There\r\nshould be several dynamos and engines. All the dynamos should, of course,\r\nbe of the same electromotive force, and feed into the same mains, from\r\nwhich all lamps draw their supply, and which are fed by feeders from the\r\ndynamo at different points, so that accident to the mains in one part of\r\nthe ship will affect that part only. But it is the arc light, used as\r\nwhat is called a search light, that is most valuable in warfare. Lieut.\r\nFiske thinks its first use was by the French in the siege of Paris, to\r\ndiscover the operations of the besiegers. It can be carried by an army in\r\nthe field, and used for examining unknown ground at night, searching for\r\nwounded on the battle field, and so on. On fighting vessels the search\r\nlight is useful in disclosing the attack of torpedo boats or of hostile\r\nships, in bringing out clearly the target for guns, and in puzzling an\r\nenemy by involving him successively in dazzling light and total darkness.\r\nLieut. Fiske suggests that this use would be equally effective in\r\nembarrassing troops groping to the attack of a fort at night by sudden\r\nalternations of blinding light and paralyzing darkness. There should be\r\nfour search lights on each side of a ship.\r\n\r\nAs to the power and beauty of the search light, Lieut. Fiske refers to\r\nthe magnificent one with which he lighted up Philadelphia last autumn,\r\nduring the electric exhibition in that city. One night he went to the\r\ntower of the Pennsylvania railroad station and watched the light\r\nstationed at the Exhibition building on 32d street. The ray of light when\r\nturned at right angles to his direction looked like a silver arrow going\r\nthrough the sky; and when turned on him, he could read the fine print of\r\na railroad time table at arm's length. Flashes from his search light were\r\nseen at a distance of thirty miles.\r\n\r\nIn using incandescent lamps for night signaling, the simplest way is to\r\narrange a keyboard with keys marked with certain numbers, indicating the\r\nnumber of lamps arranged in a prominent position, which will burn while\r\nthat key is being pressed. For example, suppose the number 5348 means\r\n\"Prepare to receive a torpedo attack.\" Press keys 5, 3, 4, 8, and the\r\nlights of lamps 5, 3, 4, 8, successively blaze out.\r\n\r\nElectrical launches have been used to some extent, their storage\r\nbatteries being first charged ashore or on board the ship to which the\r\nlaunch belongs. They have carried hundreds of people, and have made eight\r\nknots an hour. The improvement of storage batteries, steadily going on,\r\nwill eventually cause the electrical launch to replace the steam launch.\r\nOne of its advantages is in having no noise from an exhaust and no flame\r\nflaring above a smoke pipe to betray its presence. In warfare two sets of\r\nstorage batteries should be provided for launches, one being recharged\r\nwhile the other is in use.\r\n\r\nMr. Gastine Trouse has recently invented \"an electric sight,\" a filament\r\nof fine wire in a glass tube covered with metal on all sides save at the\r\nback. The battery is said to be no larger than a man's finger, and to be\r\nattached to the barrel near the muzzle by simple rubber bands, so\r\narranged that the act of attaching the battery to the barrel\r\nautomatically makes connection with the sight; and so arranged also that\r\nthe liquid of the battery is out of action except when the musket is\r\nbrought into a horizontal position for firing.\r\n\r\nTo throw a good light upon the target the same inventor has devised a\r\nsmall electric lamp and projector, which is placed on the barrel near the\r\nmuzzle by rubber bands, the battery being held at the belt of the\r\nmarksman, with such connections that the act of pressing the butt of the\r\nmusket against the shoulder completes the circuit, and causes the bright\r\ncylinder of light to fall on the target, thus enabling him to get as good\r\na shot as in the day time.\r\n\r\nSearch lights and incandescent lights are advantageously used with\r\nballoons. In submarine boats electricity will one day be very useful.\r\nSubmarine diving will play a part in future wars, and the diver's lamp\r\nwill be electrical.\r\n\r\nProgress has been made also in constructing \"electrical guns,\" in which\r\nthe cartridge contains a fuse which is ignited by pressing an electric\r\nbutton on the gun. A better aim can be had with it, when perfected, than\r\nwith one fired by a trigger. At present, according to Lieut. Fiske, this\r\ninvention has not reached the practical stage, and the necessity for a\r\nbattery to fire a cartridge is decidedly an objection. But the battery is\r\nvery small, needs little care, and will last a long time. The hard pull\r\nof the ordinary trigger causes a movement of the barrel except in the\r\nhands of the most highly skilled marksmen, and this hard pull is a\r\nnecessity, because the hammer or bolt must have considerable mass in\r\norder to strike the primer with sufficient force to explode it. Having\r\nthe mass, it must have considerable inertia; hence it needs a deep notch\r\nto hold it firm when jarred at full cock, and this deep notch\r\nnecessitates a strong pull on the trigger. But with an electric gun the\r\ncircuit-closing parts are very small and light, and can be put into a\r\nrecess in the butt of the gun, out of the way of chance blows. Thus a\r\nlight pressure of the finger is alone needed to fire it, while from the\r\nsmall inertia of the parts a sudden shock will not cause accidental\r\nclosing of the circuit and firing of the gun.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMEUCCI'S CLAIMS TO THE TELEPHONE.\r\n\r\n\r\nOur readers have already been informed through these columns that,\r\nnotwithstanding the refusal of the Attorney-General, Mr. Garland, to\r\ninstitute suit for the nullification of the Bell patent, application has\r\nagain been made by the Globe Telephone Co., of this city, the Washington\r\nTelephone Co., of Baltimore, and the Panelectric Co. These applications\r\nhave been referred to the Interior Department and Patent Office for\r\nexamination, and upon their report the institution of the suit depends.\r\nThe evidence which the companies above mentioned have presented includes\r\nnot only the statement of Prof. Gray and the circumstances connected with\r\nhis caveat, but brings out fully, for the first time, the claims of\r\nAntonio Meucci.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MEUCCI'S CAVEAT, 1871.]\r\n\r\nThe latter evidence is intended to show that Meucci invented the\r\nspeaking telephone not only before Bell, but that he antedated Reis by\r\nseveral years. In a recent interview with Meucci we obtained a brief\r\nhistory of his life and of his invention, which will, no doubt, interest\r\nour readers. Meucci, a native of Italy, was educated in the schools of\r\nFlorence, devoting his time as a student to mechanical engineering. In\r\n1844 he gave considerable attention to the subject of electricity, and\r\nhad a contract with the government of the island of Cuba to galvanize\r\nmaterials used in the army. While experimenting with electricity he read\r\nthe works of Becquerel, Mesmer, and others who treated largely of the\r\nvirtues of electricity in the cure of disease. Meucci made experiments in\r\nthis direction, and at one time thought that he heard the sound of a sick\r\nperson's voice more distinctly than usual, when he had the spatula\r\nconnected with the wire and battery in his mouth.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGS. 1 AND 2.--1849.]\r\n\r\nThe apparatus he used for this purpose is shown in Fig. 1. It consists of\r\nan oval disk or spatula of copper attached to a wire which was coiled and\r\nsupported in an insulating handle of cork. To ascertain that he was able\r\nto hear the sound, he covered the device with a funnel of pasteboard,\r\nshown in the adjoining figure, and held it to his ear, and thought that\r\nhe heard the sound more distinctly.\r\n\r\nThese instruments were constructed in 1849 in Havana, where Meucci was\r\nmechanical director of a theater. In May, 1851, he came to this country,\r\nand settled in Staten Island, where he has lived ever since. It was not\r\nuntil a year later that he again took up his telephonic studies, and then\r\nhe tried an arrangement somewhat different from the first. He used a tin\r\ntube, Figs. 3 and 4, and covered it with wire, the ends of which were\r\nsoldered to the tongue of copper. With this instrument, he states, he\r\nfrequently conversed with his wife from the basement of his house to the\r\nthird floor, where she was confined as an invalid.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGS. 3 AND 4.--1852.]\r\n\r\nContinuing his experiments, he conceived the idea of using a bobbin of\r\nwire with a metallic core, and the first instrument he constructed on\r\nthis idea is shown in Fig. 5. It consisted of a wooden tube and\r\npasteboard mouth piece, and supported within the tube was a bundle of\r\nsteel wires, surrounded at their upper end by a bobbin of insulated wire.\r\nThe diaphragm in this instrument, was an animal membrane, and it was slit\r\nin a semicircle so as to make a flap or valve which responded to the air\r\nvibrations. This was the first instrument in which he used a bobbin, but\r\nthe articulation naturally left much to be desired, on account of the use\r\nof the animal membrane. Meucci fixes the dates from the fact that\r\nGaribaldi lived with him during the years 1851-54, and he remembers\r\nexplaining the principles of his invention to the Italian patriot.\r\n\r\nAfter constructing the instrument just described, Meucci devised another\r\nduring 1853-54. This consisted of a wooden block with a hole in the\r\ncenter which was filled with magnetic iron ore, and through the center of\r\nwhich a steel wire passed. The magnetic iron ore was surrounded by a coil\r\nof insulated copper wire. But an important improvement was introduced\r\nhere in the shape of an iron diaphragm. With this apparatus greatly\r\nimproved effects were obtained.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 5.--1853.]\r\n\r\nIn 1856 Meucci first tried, he says, a horseshoe magnet, as shown in Fig.\r\n6, but he went a step backward in using an animal membrane. He states\r\nthat this form did not talk so well as some which he had made before, as\r\nmight be expected.\r\n\r\nDuring the years 1858-60 Meucci constructed the instrument shown in Fig.\r\n7. He here employed a core of tempered steel magnetized, and surrounded\r\nit with a large coil. He used an iron diaphragm, and obtained such good\r\nresults that he determined to bring his invention before the public. His\r\nnational pride prompted him to have the invention first brought out in\r\nItaly, and he intrusted the matter to a Mr. Bendalari, an Italian\r\nmerchant, who was about to start for that country. Bendalari, however,\r\nneglected the matter, and nothing was heard of it from that quarter. At\r\nthe same time Meucci described his invention in _L'Eco d'Italia_, an\r\nItalian paper published in this city, and awaited the return of\r\nBendalari.\r\n\r\nMeucci, however, kept at his experiments with the object of improving his\r\ntelephone, and several changes of form were the result. Fig. 8 shows one\r\nof these instruments constructed during 1864-65. It consisted of a ring\r\nof iron wound spirally with copper wire, and from two opposite sides iron\r\nwires attached to the core supported an iron button. This was placed\r\nopposite an iron diaphragm, which closed a cavity ending in a mouthpiece.\r\nHe also constructed the instrument which is shown in Fig. 9, and which,\r\nhe says, was the best instrument he had ever constructed. The bobbin was\r\na large one, and was placed in a soapbox of boxwood, with magnet core and\r\niron diaphragm. Still seeking greater perfection, Meucci, in 1865, tried\r\nthe bent horseshoe form, shown in Fig. 10, but found it no improvement;\r\nand, although he experimented up to the year 1871, he was not able to\r\nobtain any better results than the best of his previous instruments had\r\ngiven.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 6.--1856.]\r\n\r\nWhen Meucci arrived in this country, he had property valued at $20,000,\r\nand he entered into the brewing business and into candle making, but he\r\ngradually lost his money, until in 1868 he found himself reduced to\r\nlittle or nothing. To add to his misery, he had the misfortune of being\r\non the Staten Island ferryboat Westfield when the latter's boiler\r\nexploded with such terrible effect in 1871. He was badly scalded, and for\r\na time his life was despaired of. After he recovered he found that his\r\nwife, in their poverty, had sold all his instruments to John Fleming, a\r\ndealer in second-hand articles, and from whom parts of the instruments\r\nhave recently been recovered.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 7.--1858-60.]\r\n\r\nWith the view of introducing his invention, Meucci now determined to\r\nprotect it by a patent; and having lost his instrument, he had a drawing\r\nmade according to his sketches by an artist, Mr. Nestori. This drawing he\r\nshowed to several friends, and took them to Mr. A. Bertolino, who went\r\nwith him to a patent attorney, Mr. T.D. Stetson, in this city. Mr.\r\nStetson advised Meucci to apply for a patent, but Meucci, without funds,\r\nhad to content himself with a caveat. To obtain money for the latter he\r\nformed a partnership with A.Z. Grandi, S.G.P. Buguglio, and Ango\r\nTremeschin. The articles of agreement between them, made Dec. 12, 1871,\r\ncredit Meucci as the inventor of a speaking telegraph, and the parties\r\nagree to furnish him with means to procure patents in this and other\r\ncountries, and to organize companies, etc. The name of the company was\r\n\"Teletrofono.\" They gave him $20 with which to procure his caveat, and\r\nthat was all the money he ever received from this source.\r\n\r\nThe caveat which Meucci filed contained the drawing made by Nestori, and\r\nas shown in the cut, which is a facsimile, represents two persons with\r\ntelephones connected by wires and batteries in circuit. The caveat,\r\nhowever, does not describe the invention very clearly; it describes the\r\ntwo persons as being insulated, but Meucci claims that he never made any\r\nmention of insulating persons, but only of insulating the wires. To\r\nexplain this seeming incongruity, it must be stated that Meucci\r\ncommunicated with his attorney through an interpreter, as he was not\r\nmaster of the English language; and even at the present time he\r\nunderstands and speaks the language very poorly, so much so that we found\r\nit necessary to communicate with him in French during the conversation in\r\nwhich these facts were elicited.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 8.--1864-65.]\r\n\r\nIn the summer of 1872, after obtaining his caveat, Meucci, accompanied by\r\nMr. Bertolino, went to see Mr. Grant, at that time the Vice President of\r\nthe New York District Telegraph Company, and he told the latter that he\r\nhad an invention of sound telegraphs. He explained his inventions and\r\nsubmitted drawings and plans to Mr. Grant, and requested the privilege of\r\nmaking a test on the wires of the company, which test if successful would\r\nenable him to raise money. Mr. Grant promised to let him know when he\r\ncould make the test, but after nearly two years of waiting and\r\ndisappointment, Mr. Grant said that he had lost the drawings; and\r\nalthough Meucci then made an instrument like the one shown in Fig. 9 for\r\nthe purpose of a test, Mr. Grant never tried it. Meucci claims that he\r\nmade no secret of his invention, and as instance cites the fact that in\r\n1873 a diver by the name of William Carroll, having heard of it, came to\r\nhim and asked him if he could not construct a telephone so that\r\ncommunication could be maintained between a diver and the ship above.\r\nMeucci set about to construct a marine telephone, and he showed us the\r\nsketch of the instrument in his memorandum book, which dates from that\r\ntime and contains a number of other inventions and experiments made by\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 9.--1864-65.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 10.--1865.]\r\n\r\nWhen Professor Bell exhibited his inventions at the Centennial, Meucci\r\nheard of it, but his poverty, he claims, prevented him from making his\r\nprotestations of priority effective, and it was not until comparatively\r\nrecently that they have been brought out with any prominence.--_The\r\nElectrical World._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAN ELECTRICAL CENTRIFUGAL MACHINE FOR LABORATORIES.\r\n\r\n[Footnote: Paper read before Section B, British Association, Aberdeen\r\nmeeting.]\r\n\r\nBy ALEXANDER WATT, F.I.C., F.C.S.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe late Dr. Mohr[1] of Bonn, advocated the use of a centrifugal machine\r\nas a means of rapidly drying crystals and crystalline precipitates; but\r\nalthough they are admirably adapted for that purpose, centrifugal\r\nmachines are seldom seen in our chemical laboratories.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: \"Lehrb. d. Chem. Analyt. Titrirmethode,\" 3d ed., 1870, p.\r\n684.]\r\n\r\nThe neglect of this valuable addition to our laboratory apparatus is\r\nprobably owing to the inconvenience involved in driving the machine at a\r\nhigh speed by means of the ordinary hand driving gear, especially when\r\nthe rotation has to be maintained for a considerable length of time. It\r\noccurred to me, therefore, that by attaching the drum or basket of the\r\nmachine (or the rotating table of Mohr's apparatus) directly to the\r\nspindle of an electro-motor, the difficulty of driving might be got over,\r\nand at the same time a combination of great efficiency would result, as\r\nthe electro-motor, like the centrifugal machine, is most efficient when\r\nrun at a high speed. The apparatus shown in the sketch consists\r\nessentially of a perforated basket, A, which is slipped on to a cone\r\nattached to the spindle, S, of an electro-motor, and held in position by\r\nthe nut, D. The casing, B, with its removable cover, C, serves to receive\r\nthe liquid driven out of the substance being dried. A flat form of the\r\nordinary Siemens H armature, E, revolves between the poles, P, of the\r\nelectro-magnets, M, which are connected by means of the base plate, I.\r\nThe brass cross-bar, G, carries the top bearing of the spindle, S, and\r\nprevents the magnet poles from being drawn together.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nFrom four to six cells of a bichromate battery or Faure secondary battery\r\nfurnish sufficient power to run the machine at a high speed. An apparatus\r\nwith a copper basket four inches in diameter has been found extremely\r\nuseful in the laboratory for drying such substances as granulated\r\nsulphate of copper and sulphate of iron and ammonia, but more especially\r\nfor drying sugar, which when crystallized in very small crystals cannot\r\nbe readily separated from the sirupy mother-liquor by any of the usual\r\nlaboratory appliances. For drying substances which act on copper the\r\nbasket may be made of platinum or ebonite; in the latter case, owing to\r\nthe increased size of the perforations, it may be necessary to line the\r\nbasket with platinum wire gauze or perforated parchment paper.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTRANSMISSION OF POWER BY ELECTRICITY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe experiments of M. Marcel Deprez have entered on a decisive phase. The\r\ndynamos are completed, and were put in place on the 20th October, when M.\r\nDeprez carried out some preliminary tests in the presence of a commission\r\nconsisting of MM. Collignon, Inspector-General des Ponts et Chaussées;\r\nDelebecque, Ingenieur en Chef du Materiel et de la Traction of the\r\nNorthern Railway of France; Contanini, engineer in the same company; and\r\nSartaux. The generating dynamos made by MM. Breguet, and the receiving\r\ndynamos constructed by MM. Mignon and Rouart, were during a preliminary\r\ntrial placed side by side, one portion of the circuit being very short,\r\nand the other twice the distance between La Chapelle and Creil, or\r\nseventy miles. In future experiments the two dynamos will be placed in\r\ntheir normal positions at each end of the line. The generating machine is\r\ndriven by a locomotive engine; the resistance of its field magnets is\r\n5.68 ohms, and of the two armatures 33 ohms. The resistance of the two\r\narmatures of the receiving machine is 36.8 ohms, and the resistance of\r\nthe line is 97 ohms; the generator and receiver field magnets are excited\r\neach by a separate machine. Five different trials were made at varying\r\nspeeds of the driving shaft; the initial work on this shaft was measured\r\nby a dynamometer, and the available energy of the shaft of the receiving\r\nmachine was ascertained by a Prony brake; the other results of the\r\nexperiments were deduced from the constants of the machines and from\r\ngalvanometric measurements. For the first trials the different elements\r\nwere as follows:\r\n\r\n1. _Generating dynamos:_\r\n  Velocity of shaft                 123 revolutions.\r\n  Electromotive force at terminals, 3370.25 volts.\r\n        \"        \"            total 3624.7    \"\r\n  Available work at driving shaft.    43   h. p.\r\n  Electrical work of generator        37.38 \"\r\n  Difference absorbed                  5.62 \"\r\n\r\n2. _Line:_\r\n  Work absorbed by the line.           7.59 h. p.\r\n\r\n3. _Receiving dynamos:_\r\n  Velocity of shaft                  154 revolutions.\r\n  Electromotive force at terminals,  2616.25 volts.\r\n        \"       \"        total       2336.94  \"\r\n  Electrical work of receiver          24.10 h. p.\r\n  Available work on shaft              22.10  \"\r\n  Difference absorbed                   2     \"\r\n\r\nThe duty obtained would thus be 22.10/43 = 51.3 per cent., if the work\r\nabsorbed by the exciting machines be not considered. Taking this into\r\naccount, it would be reduced to 40 per cent.\r\n\r\nIn subsequent experiments the speed of the generator was increased\r\ngradually. In the last trial the following were the elements:\r\n\r\n1. _Generating dynamos:_\r\n  Speed of shaft                      190 revolutions.\r\n  Electromotive force at terminals    5231.25 volts.\r\n        \"       \"        total        5469.75  \"\r\n  Available work on driving shaft,      62    h. p.\r\n  Electrical work on generator          53.59  \"\r\n  Difference absorbed                    8.51  \"\r\n  Work absorbed by armature              2.33  \"\r\n\r\n2. _Line:_\r\n  Work absorbed by conductors        7.21 h. p.\r\n\r\n3. _Receiving dynamos_:\r\n  Speed of shaft                      248 revolutions.\r\n  Electromotive force at terminals    4508    volts.\r\n  Electromotive force total           4242.67  \"\r\n  Electrical work of receiver           41.44 h. p.\r\n  Work measured on receiver shaft       35.8   \"\r\n  Difference absorbed                    5.64  \"\r\n  Duty obtained, not including exciting machine 57 per cent.\r\n  Duty obtained, including exciting machine     48    \"\r\n\r\nDuring the various experiments the current traversing the line varied\r\nfrom 7.59 amperes to 7.21 amperes. No heating of any kind was observed.\r\n\r\nM.J. Bertrand, who communicated a paper to the Academy of Sciences on the\r\nsubject, commented on the relatively low speeds. It corresponds to a\r\nlinear displacement of the surface armatures, in no case exceeding the\r\nspeed of a locomotive wheel. The tension reached 5,500 volts., under very\r\nsatisfactory mechanical conditions, and with a current that in no way\r\nendangered the line. This first experiment is certainly encouraging, and\r\nit will be followed by others of a more complete and exhaustive\r\ncharacter. MM. De Rothschild are now embodying a powerful commission of\r\nFrench and foreign scientists who will follow the subject carefully, and\r\nreport upon it. It may be safely predicted that one result of this action\r\nwill be the development of a new series of observations of the highest\r\ntechnical interest and value.--_Engineering._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LOCKED AND CORDED BOX TRICK.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe trick with the locked and corded box, I believe, is an old one,\r\nthough perhaps not in its present form. In late years it has been revived\r\nwith improvements, and popularized by those clever illusionists, Messrs.\r\nMaskelyne & Cook and Dr. Lynn, at the Egyptian Hall. There are several\r\nways of working the trick or, rather, of arranging the special bit of\r\nmechanism wherein the peculiar features of the box consist. The one I am\r\nabout to describe is, I think, the best of those I am acquainted with, or\r\nat liberty to divulge. Indeed, I don't know that any method is better,\r\nand this one has the advantage over most others of allowing the performer\r\nto get into as well as out of the box, without leaving a trace of his\r\nmeans of ingress. It will be seen the box is paneled, and all the panels\r\nlook equally firm and fixed. As a matter of fact, one of the panels is\r\nmovable, though the closest scrutiny would fail to discover this if the\r\nbox and fittings are carefully made and adjusted. Fig. 1 shows the\r\ngeneral appearance of the box, of which the back is the same as the\r\nfront. In the box I describe, the end marked + has a movable panel. The\r\nsize of the box should be regulated by the size of the performer; but one\r\nmeasuring 3 feet 6 inches long by 2 feet back to front, and 21 inches\r\nhigh, exclusive of the lid, which may be 3 inches, will be of general\r\nuse. In making the box it is most important that all sides and panels\r\nlook alike, and that nothing special in the appearance of the end with\r\nthe loose panel should attract notice. Fig. 2 shows this end with\r\nfittings drawn half of full size, and it will he seen from this that the\r\nframing, A, is 3 inches wide by 1¼ inches thick, and the panel, B, ½ inch\r\nthick.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1.]\r\n\r\nIt will be noticed that the top and bottom rails of the frame are\r\nrabbeted to receive the panel, but the sides are grooved, the groove in\r\nfront rail being double the depth of the one in the back rail.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE LOCKED AND CORDED BOX TRICK. By DAVID B. ADAMSON.]\r\n\r\nThe dotted line, B, shows the size of the panel; the dotted line, C,\r\nshows the depth of groove in the front rail. From this it will be clear\r\nthat the panel is only held in place at the back and front, and that on\r\nsliding it toward the front it will be free out of the groove in the back\r\nrail. Three sides of it are thus free, and a little manipulation will\r\nallow of its being taken out altogether, leaving plenty of space for the\r\nperformer to get out, presuming him to have been locked inside the box.\r\n\r\nIf the panel were to be finished in this way, without further fittings,\r\nthe secret would soon be discovered; and I now proceed to show how the\r\npanel is held in place and firm while under examination.\r\n\r\nDetermine the size of screws that are to be used in fixing the brass\r\ncorner clamps. Let us say No. 7 is decided on; and if brass screws are\r\nused, then get a piece of brass, Fig. 4, the exact diameter of the\r\nscrew-head, and a little longer than the thickness of the framing. If\r\niron screws are to be used, then this piece must be iron. Now bore a hole\r\ninto which this bolt will fit closely, right through the framing at D,\r\nFig. 2. It is most important that the hole should be made close up to the\r\nedge of the panel, B, so that when the bolt is in it firmly holds the\r\npanel, and prevents it moving from back to front in the grooving. Now get\r\na piece of sheet brass, 1/8 inch thick, and cut it to the shape shown by\r\nE, Fig. 2. The width of this piece should not be less than 3/8 inch, and\r\nit must be of such length that the end reaches to the middle of the top\r\nframing, as shown at L, Fig. 2. This piece of brass is sunk in the top\r\nand front framing, as shown by the dotted lines, G, in Figs. 2 and 3, and\r\nalso in section in the latter.\r\n\r\nWhen the box is open, the lower or short arm of this lever, which is\r\nshaped as shown full size, at E, Fig. 8, is kept pressed down on the\r\nbolt, D, as shown by the dotted lines, E, E, E, Fig. 2, and E, Fig. 7, by\r\nof the spring, J, Fig. 2.\r\n\r\nOn the box being closed, a pin on the under edge of lid goes into the\r\nhole, L, Fig. 3, and presses the end of the lever down in such a way as\r\nto raise the claw end of it from D. The thick dotted lines, F, F, F, Fig.\r\n2, show position of lever when box is closed.\r\n\r\nIt will be noted that the bolt, D, Fig. 4, has a groove cut in it all\r\naround, into which the claw fits. This prevents the bolt being pushed\r\nbackward or forward when the box is open.\r\n\r\nThe lever must be hung as shown, K, Fig. 2. The exact position of this\r\nis immaterial, but it is as well to have the fulcrum as near the end as\r\nmay be, in order that the claw may be raised sufficiently with only a\r\nsmall movement of the short arm of the lever. Of course, the shorter the\r\narm is, the more accurately the lid and pin must be made to close.\r\n\r\nIf the pin, pressing short arm down, be too short, the pressure will not\r\nbe enough to release the claw, and consequently the performer might find\r\nhimself really unable to get out of the box after it is locked.\r\n\r\nThe end of the lever should be finished with a wood block, as Fig. 6,\r\nlarger than the pin on the lid, as represented by L and M, Fig. 3.\r\n\r\nThe block may be of other material, but should be colored the same as the\r\nwood the box is made of, so that, if any one were to look down on it, no\r\nsuspicion would be aroused, as might be were plain brass used.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG 4.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG 5.]\r\n\r\nIn Fig. 5, I show an easy way of hanging the lever. It is simply a piece\r\nof wire sharpened and notched, so as to form several small barbs,\r\npreventing withdrawal. The mode of fixing will be easily understood by\r\nreference to B and C, Fig. 5. Some considerable amount of care will have\r\nto be bestowed on fitting and adjusting this part of the work, on which\r\nthe successful performance of the trick consists, and before finally\r\nfixing up, it should be ascertained that all the movements work\r\nharmoniously. It will be best to cut the groove in which the lever works\r\nfrom below, and, after the lever is fixed, to fill up the space not\r\nrequired by the lever with strips of wood, H, H. If preferred, the space\r\ncan be shaped out from the back, i.e., the inside of the framing, and\r\nthen filled where not required, but as this, however neatly done, would\r\nshow a joint which might be detected by sharp eyes, it is better to cut\r\nfrom below, though more troublesome.\r\n\r\nThe end containing the movable panel being arranged, make up the rest of\r\nthe box to it, taking care to make the rebates of the top and bottom\r\nframes to correspond with those of the end.\r\n\r\nThe other panels should not, however, depend on the grooves on two sides\r\nonly, but at tops and bottoms as well.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 6.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 7. & FIG. 8.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 9.]\r\n\r\nThe rebates are to be cut only to have all the framing inside look alike;\r\nand as the panel, B, is made to fit quite close into the rebate, it will\r\nnot be surmised that it is not fitted in the usual way.\r\n\r\nAfter the box is made and fitted together, the clamping must be done. The\r\nonly necessity for this is in order that the bolt, D, which we have seen\r\nis made on the outside end exactly to match the screws used to fasten the\r\nclamps, should not be conspicuous, as it would be were it alone. As it\r\nis, it will not be specially observable, being apparently only one of the\r\nscrews to fasten the clamps.\r\n\r\nThe clamps may be of thin brass or iron, shaped as shown at Fig. 9. One\r\nof the corner holes must be arranged to cover D exactly, and the others\r\nregulated to it. Let us suppose that A, Fig. 9, is the one through which\r\nthe bolt goes; the other corner screw holes must be equally distant from\r\nthe edges of the clamps. Twelve of these clamps will be needed. After\r\nthey have been screwed on, put the bolt through, and let the claw of the\r\nlever hold it in place. Then mark and cut the bolt flush with the clamp,\r\nmaking a hollow on the end of it to imitate the screws, as D, Fig. 4. The\r\nother end of the bolt should either be made flush with the inside of\r\nframe and colored to match it, or, better, cut short and faced flush with\r\na piece of wood to match the framing.\r\n\r\nIf a piece of wood with a knot be chosen for this side of the frame, so\r\nmuch the better. Immediately over the hole, L, a wooden pin should be\r\nfixed in the lid, and of such length that it will press the short arm of\r\nlever down sufficiently. It should fit the hole pretty closely.\r\n\r\nAt the other end, a corresponding pin and hole should be made, and, say,\r\ntwo along the front. These will then look as if they were intended merely\r\nas fittings to hold the lid in position. The lid at the other end of the\r\nbox from the movable panel should have a stop of some sort; the ordinary\r\nbrass joint stop will do as well as any, and should be strong. The reason\r\nfor placing it at what I may call \"the other end\" is that, when the box\r\nis being examined, it will attract notice, and draw attention from the\r\nmovable panel end.\r\n\r\nWe may now finally adjust the loose panel, which must fit tight at top\r\nand bottom, and be slightly beveled, as shown on section. Two holes must\r\nalso be cut through it, at such a distance from each other that a finger\r\nand thumb can be put through them, so as to allow of the panel being\r\nmoved. In the deep grooving in front also put a couple of springs, say\r\npieces of clock springs, as shown, I, I, Fig, 2. These serve to assist\r\nthe bolt, D, by pushing the panel into position.\r\n\r\nHoles to match those in end panel must also be cut in the other panels,\r\nand when a lock, preferably a padlock, has been fitted, the box is\r\ncomplete.\r\n\r\nI don't know whether it is necessary to say that the lid should be hinged\r\nat the back, and of course it will add to the appearance of the box if it\r\nbe polished or oiled.\r\n\r\nNow, for those who may not have seen the locked and corded box trick\r\nperformed, a few words of caution may not be out of place. Don't forget\r\nto have something in a pocket easily got at that will serve to push the\r\nbolt out, before going into the box. A piece of stout wire, a small\r\npencil case, or anything of that sort will do. Be careful when getting\r\ninto the box to lie with your head toward the loose panel end, and face\r\ntoward the front--as there will be no space to turn round; the right hand\r\nwill then be uppermost and free to push the bolt out. Having done this,\r\ngrasp the panel with the finger and thumb by means of the two holes, push\r\nit to the front of the box, when the back edge will be clear of the\r\ngroove. It can now easily be pulled into the box, and the performer can\r\ncreep out. When out, refix panel and bolt so that everything looks as it\r\nwas. Any cording that may be over the end of the box will give\r\nsufficiently to allow of exit.\r\n\r\nI have, I think, made it quite clear that padlock and ropes have nothing\r\nto do with the real performance of the trick, but they serve to mystify\r\nspectators, who may be allowed to knot the rope and seal the knots in any\r\nway they choose.\r\n\r\nThere must always be a screen or curtain to hide the box from the\r\nspectators while the performer is getting in or out.--_D.B.

It is only by reason of improved\r\nmethods of preparation that the latter have become cheaper, while their\r\nuse has at the same time increased. Iridium is mixed with platinum in\r\norder to increase its strength and durability. The normal standards of\r\nthe metrical system are made of platinum-iridium on account of its known\r\nimmutabilty. In 1882, platinum stood 15 per cent. below its present\r\nvalue; but its increased employment for industrial purposes led to the\r\nsubsequent improvement in price. Thallium has experienced a severe\r\ndepreciation on account of the economical process by which it is\r\nextracted from the residue of the lead chambers used in the manufacture\r\nof sulphuric acid. The use of this metal is mainly confined to\r\nexperimental purposes. The fall in silver has arisen from increased\r\nproduction and diminished use for coinage.\r\n\r\nMagnesium was scarcely of any industrial value prior to the fall in price\r\nnow recorded. Improved processes for its treatment have successfully\r\nengaged the attention of scientific men, and it is now capable of being\r\nused as an alloy with other metals. The Salindres factory regulates the\r\nprice to a certain extent, and its system of working is regarded as a\r\nguide in the various processes connected with this branch of industry.\r\nThe manufacture of potassium and sodium will, it is expected, be more\r\nfully elucidated than hitherto, by means of researches made at Schering's\r\nCharlottenburg factory. The course of nickel prices illustrates the\r\nstimulus to economical production afforded by an increased consumption.\r\nThis latter fact is principally due to the employment of nickel for\r\ncoinage, as alloy for alfenide, etc. The use of cadmium is materially\r\nrestricted by its relatively limited supply. Hitherto, its only source\r\nwas in the incidental products of zinc distillation, but of late it has\r\nbeen attempted to bring it into solution from its oxide combinations. An\r\nincreased employment of cadmium for industrial purposes is expected to\r\nfollow.\r\n\r\nProduction in excess of the demand has caused the depreciation recorded\r\nin tin, and various other metals not commented upon, this remark applying\r\neven to the scarce metals, arsenic and antimony. Even the better marks of\r\nCornwall tin and Mansfield refined copper have had to follow the downward\r\ncourse of the market.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA PERPETUAL CALENDAR.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe annexed figure represents a perpetual calendar, which any one can\r\nconstruct for himself, and which permits of finding the day that\r\ncorresponds to a given date, and conversely.\r\n\r\nThe apparatus consists of a certain number of circles and arcs of circles\r\ndivided by radii. The ring formed by the two last internal circles is\r\ndivided into 28 equal parts, which bear the names of the week, the first\r\nseven letters of the alphabet in reversed order, and two signs X. The\r\ncircle formed by the external circumference of the ring constitutes the\r\nmovable part of the apparatus, and revolves around its center. Two\r\ncircular sectors, which are diametrically opposite, are each divided into\r\nseven parts and constitute the fixed portions. In the divisions of the\r\nupper sector are distributed the months, according to the order of the\r\nmonthly numbers. In the other sector the days of the month are regularly\r\ndistributed. In order to render the affair complete, a table is arranged\r\nupon the movable disk for giving the annual numbers, or rather, in this\r\ncase, the annual letters. The calendar is used as follows: Say, for\r\nexample, we wish to find what days correspond to the different dates of\r\nAugust, 1885; we look in the table for the letter (D) that corresponds to\r\nthis year; then we bring this letter under the given month (August) and\r\nthe days marked upon the movable disk corresponding to the dates sought,\r\nand it only remains to make a simple reading.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PERPETUAL CALENDAR.]\r\n\r\nIt will be seen that the leap-years correspond to two letters. We here\r\nemploy the first to Feb. 29 inclusive, and the second for the balance of\r\nthe year. The calendar may be made of cardboard, and be fixed to\r\nwood.--_La Nature._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAN ACCOMPLISHED PARROT.\r\n\r\n\r\nAround the door of a Sixth Ave. bird store near Twenty-third St. was\r\ngathered the other day a crowd so large that it was a work of several\r\nminutes to gain entrance to the interior. From within there proceeded a\r\nhoarse voice dashed with a suspicion of whisky, which bellowed in\r\nIrish-American brogue the enlivening strains of \"Peek-a-boo.\" With each\r\nreiteration of \"Peek-a-boo\" the crowd hallooed with delight, and one\r\nsmall boy, in the exuberance of his joy, tied himself into a sort of knot\r\nand rolled on the pavement. Suddenly the inebriated Irishman came to a\r\ndead stop, and another voice, pleasanter in quality, sang the inspiring\r\nnational ode of \"Yankee Doodle,\" followed by the stentorian query and\r\nanswer all in one, \"How are the Psi-Upsilon boys? Oh, they're all right!\"\r\n\r\nA passer-by, puzzled at the scene, made his way into the store and soon\r\nsolved the mystery. In a large cage in the center was an enormous green\r\nand yellow parrot, which was hanging by one foot to a swinging perch, and\r\ntrolling forth in different voices with the ease of an accomplished\r\nventriloquist. He resumed a normal position as he was approached, and\r\nflapping his wings bellowed out, \"Hurrah for Elaine and Logan!\" Then,\r\ncocking his head on one side, he dropped into a more conversational tone,\r\nand with a regular \"Alice in Wonderland\" air remarked: \"It's never too\r\nlate to mend a bird in the hand;\" and again, after a pause, \"It's a long\r\nlane that never won fair lady.\" His visitor affably remarked:\r\n\r\n\"You're quite an accomplished bird, Polly,\" and quick as a flash the\r\ncreature replied:\r\n\r\n\"I can spell, I can. C-a-t, cat. D-o-g, fox,\" with an affectation of\r\njuvenility which was grewsome. He resented an ill-advised attempt at\r\nfamiliarity by snapping at the finger which tried to scratch his poll,\r\nand barked out:\r\n\r\n\"Take care! I'm a bad bird, I am. You betcher life!\"\r\n\r\n\"He's one of the cleverest parrots I have had for some time,\" said his\r\nowner, Mr. Holden. \"In fact, he is almost as good as Ben Butler, whom I\r\nsold to Patti. His stock of proverbs seems inexhaustible, and he makes\r\nthem quite funny by the ingenious way in which he mixes them up. I could\r\nnot begin to tell you all the things he says, but his greatest\r\naccomplishment is his singing. He is a double yellowhead--the only\r\nspecies of parrot which does sing. The African grays are better talkers,\r\nbut they do not sing. They only whistle. What do I ask for him? Oh, I\r\nthink $200 is cheap for such a paragon, don't you?\"--_N.Y.

Those who, for the last six or\r\nseven years, have gone thither to work with diligence find at every\r\nrecurring season some improvement or new progress.\r\n\r\nA rented house, a small shed in a yard, little or no apparatus, and four\r\nwork rooms--such was the debut of the station; and modest it was, as may\r\nbe seen. Later on, the introduction of a temporary aquarium, which,\r\nwithout being ornamental, was not lacking in convenience, sufficed for\r\nmaking some fine discoveries regarding numerous animals.\r\n\r\nA small boat served for supplying necessaries to the few workers who were\r\nthen visiting Roscoff; but as the number of these kept gradually\r\nincreasing, it became necessary to think of enlarging the station, and\r\nthe purchase of a piece of property was decided upon. Since then, Mr.\r\nLacaze Duthiers has done nothing but develop and transform this first\r\nacquisition. A large house, which was fitted up in 1879, formed the new\r\nlaboratory. This was built in a large garden situated nearly at the edge\r\nof the sea. We say _nearly_, as the garden in fact was separated from the\r\nsea by a small road. The plan in Fig. 1 shows that this road makes an\r\nangle; but formerly it was straight, and passed over the terrace which\r\nnow borders upon the fish pond. How many measures, voyages, and endless\r\ndiscussions, and how much paper and ink, it has taken to get this road\r\nceded to the laboratory! Finally, after months of contest, victory\r\nrewarded Mr. Duthiers's tenacity, and he was then able to begin the\r\nconstruction of a pond and aquarium. All this was not done at once.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1.--PLAN OF THE ROSCOFF LABORATORY.]\r\n\r\nAnother capital improvement was made in 1882. The public school adjoining\r\nthe establishment was ceded to it, the separating walls fell, the school\r\nbecame a laboratory, the class rooms were replaced by halls for research,\r\nand now no trace of the former separation can be seen--so uniform a whole\r\ndoes the laboratory form. No one knows what patience it required to form,\r\npiecemeal as it were, so vast an establishment, and one whose every part\r\nso completely harmonizes.\r\n\r\nDuring the same year a park, one acre in area, was laid out on the beach\r\nopposite the laboratory. This is daily covered by the sea, and forms a\r\npreserve in which animals multiply, and which, during the inclement\r\nseason, when distant excursions are impossible, permits of satisfying the\r\ndemands that come from every quarter. All, however, is not finished. Last\r\nyear a small piece of land was purchased for the installation of\r\nhydraulic apparatus for filling the aquarium. This acquisition was\r\nlikewise indispensable, in order to prevent buildings from being erected\r\nupon the land and shutting off the light from the work rooms opposite.\r\nAlas, here we find our enemy again--the little road! Negotiations have\r\nbeen going on for eighteen months with the common council, and, what is\r\nworse, with the army engineers, concerning the cession of this wretched\r\nfootpath.\r\n\r\nThe reader now knows the principal phases of the increases and\r\nimprovements through which the Roscoff station has passed. If, with the\r\nplan before his eyes, he will follow us, we will together visit the\r\nvarious parts of the laboratory. The principal entrance is situated upon\r\nthe city square, one of the sides of which is formed by the buildings of\r\nthe station. We first enter a large and beautiful garden ornamented with\r\nlarge trees and magnificent flowers which the mild and damp climate of\r\nRoscoff makes bloom in profusion. We next enter a work room which is\r\ndesigned for those pupils who, doing no special work, come to Roscoff in\r\norder to study from nature what has been taught them theoretically in the\r\nlecture courses of schools, etc. There is room here for nine pupils, to\r\neach of whom the laboratory offers two tables, with tanks, bowls,\r\nreagents, microscopes, and instruments of all kinds for cabinet study, as\r\nwell as for researches upon animals on the beach. Here the pupils are in\r\npresence of each other, and so the explanations given by the laboratory\r\nassistants are taken advantage of by all. At the end of this room, on\r\nturning to the left, we find two large apartments--the library and\r\nmuseum. Here have been gradually collected together the principal works\r\nconcerning the fauna of Roscoff and the English Channel, maps and plans\r\nuseful for consultation, numerous memoirs, and a small literary library.\r\nThe scientific collection contains the greater portion of the animals\r\nthat inhabit the vicinity of Roscoff. To every specimen is affixed a\r\nlabel giving a host of data concerning the habits, method of capture, and\r\nthe various biological conditions special to it. In a few years, when the\r\ndata thus accumulated every season by naturalists have been brought\r\ntogether, we shall have a most valuable collection of facts concerning\r\nthe fauna of the coast of France. Two store rooms at the end of these\r\napartments occupy the center of the laboratory, and are thus more easy of\r\naccess from the work rooms, and the objects that each one desires can be\r\nquickly got for him.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 2.--INTERIOR OF ONE OF THE STALLS FOR STUDY.]\r\n\r\nAfter the store rooms comes what was formerly the class room for boys,\r\nand which has space for three workers, and then the former girls' class\r\nroom, which has space for eight more. Let us stop for a moment in this\r\nlarge room, which is divided up into eight stalls, each of which is put\r\nat the disposal of some naturalist who is making original researches.\r\nFig. 2 represents one of these, and all the rest are like it. Three\r\ntables are provided, the space between which is occupied by the worker.\r\nOf these, one is reserved for the tanks that contain the animals,\r\nanother, placed opposite a window giving a good light, supports the\r\noptical apparatus, and the last is occupied by delicate objects,\r\ndrawings, notes, etc., and is, after a manner, the worker's desk. Some\r\nshelving, some pegs, and a small cupboard complete the stall. It is\r\nunnecessary to say that the laboratory furnishes gratuitously to those\r\nwho are making researches everything that can be of service to them.\r\n\r\nFour of these stalls are situated to the north, with a view of the sea,\r\nand the other four overlook the garden. They are separated from each\r\nother by a simple partition, and all open on a wide central corridor that\r\nleads to the aquarium. Before reaching the latter we find two offices\r\nthat face each other, one of them for the lecturer and the other for the\r\npreparator. These rooms, as far as their arrangement is concerned, are\r\nidentical with the stalls of the workers. The laboratory, then, is\r\ncapable of receiving twenty-three workers at a time, and of offering them\r\nevery facility for researches.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 3.--GENERAL VIEW OF THE ROSCOFF LABORATORY.]\r\n\r\nThe aquarium is an immense room, 98 ft. in length by 33 in width, glazed\r\nat the two sides. It is at present occupied only by temporary tanks that\r\nare to be replaced before long by twenty large ones of 130 gallons\r\ncapacity, and two oval basins of from 650 to 875 gallons capacity,\r\nconstructed after the model of the one that is giving so good results at\r\nBanyuls. At the extremity of the aquarium there is a store room\r\ncontaining trawls, nets of all kinds, and mops, for the capture of\r\nanimals. Here too is kept the rigging of the two laboratory boats, the\r\nDentale and Laura. Above the store room is located the director's work\r\nroom.\r\n\r\nA wide terrace separates the aquarium from the pond. This latter is 38\r\nyards long by 35 wide. Thanks to a system of sluice valves, it is filled\r\nduring high tide, and the water is shut in at low tide, thus permitting\r\nof having a supply of living animals in boxes and baskets until the\r\nresources of the laboratory permit of a more improved arrangement. This\r\nbasin is shown in Fig. 3. It is at the north side of the laboratory as\r\nseen from the beach. Here too we see the aquarium, the garden, and a\r\nportion of the shore that serves as a post for the station boats.\r\n\r\nWe must not, in passing, fail to mention the extreme convenience that the\r\nproximity of the aquarium work room to the pond and sea offers to the\r\nstudent.\r\n\r\nThis entire collection of halls, constituting the scientific portion of\r\nthe laboratory, occupies the ground floor. The first and second stories\r\nare occupied by sleeping apartments, fourteen in number. These, without\r\nbeing luxurious, are sufficiently comfortable, and offer the great\r\nadvantage that they are very near the work rooms, thus permitting of\r\nobserving, at leisure, and at any hour of the day or night, the animals\r\nunder study.\r\n\r\nEverything is absolutely free at the laboratory. The work rooms,\r\ninstruments, reagents, boats, dwelling apartments, etc., are put at the\r\ndisposal of all with an equal liberality; and this absence of distinction\r\nbetween rich or poor, Frenchmen or foreigners, is the source of a\r\ncharming cordiality and good will among the workers.\r\n\r\nShall we speak, too, of the richness of the Roscoff fauna? This has\r\nbecome proverbial among zoologists, as can be attested by the 265 of them\r\nwho have worked at the laboratory. The very numerous and remarkable\r\nmemoirs that have been prepared here are to be found recorded in the\r\nfourteen volumes of the _Archives de Zoologie Experimentale_ founded by\r\nMr. Lacaze Duthiers.\r\n\r\nIt only remains to express our hope that the aquarium may be soon\r\nfinished; but before this is done it will be necessary to get possession\r\nof that unfortunate little road. After this final victory, Mr. Duthiers\r\nin his turn will be able, amid his pupils, to enjoy all those advantages\r\nof his work which he has until now offered to others, but from which he\r\nhimself has gained no benefit.--_La Nature._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MURÆNÆ AT THE BERLIN AQUARIUM.\r\n\r\n\r\nOf all fish, eels are probably the most interesting, as the least is\r\nknown of them. Electricians are now examining the animal source of\r\nelectricity in the electric eel (Gymnotus electricus); zoologists are\r\nstill searching for the solution of the problem of the generation of\r\neels, of which no more is known than that the young eels are not born\r\nalive; and numerous fishing societies are now studying the important\r\nquestion of raising eels in ponds, lakes, etc., that are not connected\r\nwith the sea.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE MURÆNÆ AT THE BERLIN AQUARIUM.]\r\n\r\nThe annexed cut, taken from the _Illustrirte Zeitung_, is a copy of a\r\ndrawing by Muetzel, and represents a group of Mediterranean Murænæ\r\n(Muræna Helena). This fish attains a length of from 5 ft. to 6 ft., and\r\nhas a smooth, scaleless body of a dark color, on which large light-yellow\r\nspots appear, which give the fish a very peculiar appearance. The\r\npectoral fin is missing, but it has the dorsal and anal fins, which it\r\nuses with great ability. Its head is pointed, and its jaws are provided\r\nwith extraordinarily sharp teeth, which are inclined toward the rear; and\r\nat each side of the head it is provided with a gill. The nostrils are on\r\nthe upper side of the snout, and a second, tubular, pair of nostrils is\r\nlocated near the eyes. The bright eyes have a fierce expression, which\r\nmakes the fish appear very much like a snake. These fish are ravenous,\r\nand devour crabs, snails, worms, and fishes, and if they have no other\r\nfood, bite off the tails of their brethren. They are caught in eel\r\nbaskets or cages, and by means of hooks; but they are rather dangerous to\r\nhandle, as they attack the fishermen and injure them severely.\r\n\r\nSince the times of the ancients, Murænæ have been prized very highly on\r\naccount of their savory flesh. The Romans were great experts at feeding\r\nthese fish, Vidius Pollio being the master of them all, as he made a\r\npractice of feeding his Murænæ with the flesh of slaves sentenced to\r\ndeath. Pliny states that at Cæsar's triumphal entry Hirius furnished six\r\nthousand Murænæ. Slaves were frequently driven into the ponds, and were\r\nimmediately attacked by the voracious fishes, and killed in a very short\r\ntime.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMETAMORPHOSES OF ARCTIC INSECTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the chapter entitled \"Das insektenleben in arktischen ländern,\" which\r\nDr. Christopher Aurivillius contributes to the account of A.E.\r\nNordenskiöld's Arctic investigations, published this year in Leipzig,[2]\r\nthe author says: \"The question of the mode of life of insects and of its\r\nrelation to their environment in the extreme north is one of especial\r\ninterest. Knowing, as we do, that any insect in the extreme north has at\r\nthe most not more than from four to six weeks in each year for its\r\ndevelopment, we wonder how certain species can pass through their\r\nmetamorphosis in so short a period. R. McLachlan adverts, in his work\r\nupon the insects of Grinnell Land, to the difficulties which the\r\nshortness of the summer appears to put in the way of the development of\r\nthe insects, and expresses the belief that the metamorphosis which we are\r\naccustomed here to see passed through in one summer there requires\r\nseveral summers. The correctness of this supposition has been completely\r\nshown by the interesting observations which G. Sandberg has made upon\r\nspecies of lepidoptera in South Varanger, at 69° 40' north latitude.\r\nSandberg succeeded in following the development from the egg onward of\r\nsome species of the extreme north. _Oeneis bore_, Schn., a purely Arctic\r\nbutterfly, may be taken as an example. This species has never been found\r\noutside of Arctic regions, and even there occurs only in places of purely\r\nArctic stamp. It flies from the middle of June onward, and lays its eggs\r\non different species of grass. The eggs hatch the same summer; the larva\r\nhibernates under ground, continues eating and growing the next summer,\r\nand does not even then reach its full development, but winters a second\r\ntime and pupates the following spring. The pupa, which in closely related\r\nforms, in regions further to the south, is suspended free in the air upon\r\na blade of grass or like object, is in this case made in the ground,\r\nwhich must be a very advantageous habit is so raw a climate. The imago\r\nleaves the pupa after from five or six weeks, an uncommonly long period\r\nfor a butterfly. In more southern regions the butterfly pupa rests not\r\nmore than fourteen days in summer. The entire development, then, takes\r\nplace much more slowly than it does in regions further south. Sandberg\r\nhas shown, then, by this and other observations, that the Arctic summer,\r\neven at 70° N., is not sufficient for the development of many\r\nbutterflies, but that they make use of two or more summers for it. If\r\nthen more than one summer is requisite for the metamorphosis of the\r\nbutterflies, it appears to me still more likely that the humble-bees need\r\nmore than one summer for their metamorphosis. With us only the developed\r\nfemale lives over from one year to the next; in spring she builds the new\r\nnest, lays eggs, and rears the larvæ which develop into the workers, who\r\nimmediately begin to help in the support of the family; finally, toward\r\nautumn, males and females are developed. It seems scarcely credible that\r\nall this can take place each summer in the same way in Grinnell Land, at\r\n82° N., especially as the access to food must be more limited than it is\r\nwith us. The development of the humble-bee colony must surely be quite\r\ndifferent there. If it is not surely proved that the humble-bees occur at\r\nso high latitudes, one would not, with a knowledge of their mode of life,\r\nbe inclined to believe that they could live under such conditions. They\r\nseem, however, to have one advantage over their relatives in the south.\r\nIn the Arctic regions none of those parasites are found which in other\r\nregions lessen their numbers, such as the _conopidæ_ among the flies, the\r\nmutillas among the hymenoptera, and others.\"--_Psyche._\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Nordenskiöld, A.E., Studien und forschungen veranlasst durch\r\nmeine reisen im hohen norden.

MERRIAM, M.D., Omaha, Neb.,\r\n\r\n\r\nProfessor of the Principles and Practice of Medicine in the\r\nUniversity of Nebraska College of Medicine, Lincoln, Neb.\r\n\r\nThe records of the Nebraska State Medical Society show that the only\r\nreport of progress on nervous and mental diseases ever made in the\r\nhistory of the society (sixteen years) was made by the writer last year;\r\nand expecting that those appointed to make a report this year would,\r\njudging by the history of the past, fail to prepare such a report, I have\r\nseen fit to prepare a brief volunteer report of such items of progress as\r\nhave come to my notice during the last twelve months. I have not been\r\nable to learn that any original work has been done in our State during\r\nthe past year, nor that those having charge of the insane hospital have\r\nutilized the material at their command to add to the sum of our knowledge\r\nof mental diseases.\r\n\r\nLast year I said: \"There is a growing sentiment that many diseases not\r\nheretofore regarded as nervous (and perhaps all diseases) are of nervous\r\norigin.\" This truth, that all pathologico-histological changes in the\r\ntissues of the body are degenerative in character, and, whether caused by\r\na parasite, a poison, or some unknown influence, are first brought about\r\nby or through a changed innervation, is one that is being accepted very\r\nlargely by the best men in the profession, and the accumulation of facts\r\nis increasing rapidly, and the acceptance of this great truth will prove\r\nto be little short of revolutionary in its influence on the treatment of\r\nthe disease. This is the outgrowth of the study of disease from the\r\nstandpoint of the evolution hypothesis. Derangements of function precede\r\nabnormalities of structure; hence the innervation must be at fault before\r\nthe organ fails. Hence the art of healing should aim at grappling with\r\nthe neuroses first, for the local trophic changes, perverted secretions,\r\nand structural abnormalities are the effects or symptoms, not the causes\r\nof the disease. Dr. J.L. Thudicum has studied the chemical constitution\r\nof the brain, and he holds that, \"When the normal composition of the\r\nbrain shall be known to the uttermost item, then pathology can begin its\r\nsearch for abnormal compounds or derangements of quantities.\" The great\r\ndiseases of the brain and spine, such as general paralysis, acute and\r\nchronic mania, and others, the author believes will all be shown to be\r\nconnected with special chemical changes in neuroplasm, and that a\r\nknowledge of the composition and properties of this tissue and of its\r\nconstituents will materially aid in devising modes of radical treatment\r\nin cases in which, at present, only tentative symptomatic measures are\r\ntaken.\r\n\r\nThe whole drift of recent brain inquiry sets toward the notion that the\r\nbrain always acts as a whole, and that no part of it can be discharging\r\nwithout altering the tensions of all the other parts; for an identical\r\nfeeling cannot recur, for it would have to recur in an unmodified brain,\r\nwhich is an impossibility, since the structure of the brain itself is\r\ncontinually growing different under the pressure of experience.\r\n\r\nInsanity is a disease of the most highly differentiated parts of the\r\nnervous system, in which the psychical functions, as thought, feeling,\r\nand volition, are seriously impaired, revealing itself in a series of\r\nmental phenomena. Institutions for the insane were at first founded for\r\npublic relief, and not to benefit the insane; but this idea has changed\r\nin the past, and there is a growing feeling that a natural and domestic\r\nabode, adapted to the varying severity of the different degrees of\r\ninsanity, should be the place for the insane, with some reference to\r\ntheir wants and necessities, and that many patients (not all) could be\r\nbetter treated in a domestic or segregate asylum than in the prison-like\r\nstructures that so often exist, and that the asylum should be as much\r\nhouse-like and home-like in character as the nature of the insanity would\r\npermit; while exercise and feeding are accounted as among the best\r\nremedies in some cases of insanity, particularly in acute mania.\r\n\r\nThe new disease called morbus Thomsenii, of which I wrote in my report\r\nlast year, has been carefully studied by several men of eminence, and the\r\nfollowing conclusions have been reached as to its pathology: The weight\r\nof the evidence seems to prove that it is of a neuropathic rather than a\r\nmyopathic nature, and that it depends on an exaggerated activity of the\r\nnervous apparatus which produces muscular tone, and that it has much\r\nanalogy to the muscular phenomena of hysterical hypnosis, the genesis of\r\nwhich is precisely explained by a functional hyperactivity of the nervous\r\ncenters of muscular activity. Until quite recently it was supposed that\r\nthe rhythmical action of the heart was entirely due to the periodical and\r\norderly discharge of motor nerve force in the nerve ganglia which are\r\nscattered through the organ; but recent physiological observations, more\r\nespecially the brilliant researches of Graskell, seem to show that the\r\ninfluence of the cardiac ganglia is not indispensable, and that the\r\nmuscular fiber itself, in some of the lower animals, at all events\r\npossesses the power of rhythmical contraction.\r\n\r\nSeveral valuable additions to our knowledge of the anatomy of the nervous\r\nsystem have been made by Huschke, Exner, Fuchs, and Tuczek.\r\n\r\nTuczek and Fuchs have confirmed the discoveries of Exner, that there are\r\nno medullated nerve fibers in the convolutions of the infant, and\r\nFlechzig has developed this law, that \"medullated nerve fibers appear\r\nfirst in the region of the pyramidal tracts and corona radiata, and\r\nextend from them to the convolutions and periphery of the brain,\" being\r\npractically completed about the eighth year. This fact is of practical\r\nimportance in nervous and mental diseases, since it is becoming an\r\nadmitted truth that the histological changes in disease follow in an\r\ninverse order the developmental processes taking place in the embryo.\r\nHence the recent physiological division of the nervous system by Dr.\r\nHughlings Jackson into highest, middle, and lowest centers, and the\r\nevolution of the cerebro-spinal functions from the most automatic to the\r\nleast automatic, from the most simple to the most complex, from the most\r\norganized to the least organized. In the recognition of this division we\r\nhave the promise of a steadier and more scientific advance, both in the\r\nphysiology and in the pathology of the nervous system.\r\n\r\nMr. Victor Horsley has recently demonstrated the existence of true\r\nsensory nerves supplying the nerve trunks of nervi-nervorum.\r\n\r\nProf. Hamilton, of Aberdeen, claims that the corpus callosum is not a\r\ncommissure, but the decussation of cortical fibers on their way down to\r\nenter the internal and external capsules of the opposite side.\r\n\r\nProfs. Burt G. Wilder, of Ithaca, and T. Jefrie Parker, of New Zealand\r\nInstitute, have proposed a new nomenclature for macroscopic encephalic\r\nanatomy, which, while seemingly imperfect in many respects, has, at\r\nleast, the merit of stimulating thought, and has given an impulse to a\r\nreform which will not cease until something has been actually\r\naccomplished in this direction. The object being to substitute for many\r\nof the polynomial terms, technical and vernacular, now in use, technical\r\nnames which are brief and consist of a single word. This has already been\r\nadopted by several neurologists, of whom we may mention Spitzka, Ramsey,\r\nWright, and H.T. Osborn.\r\n\r\nLuys holds that the brain, as a whole, changes its position in the\r\ncranial cavity according to different attitudes of the body, the free\r\nspaces on the upper side being occupied by cerebro-spinal fluid, which,\r\nobeying the laws of gravity, is displaced by the heavier brain substance\r\nin different positions of the body.\r\n\r\nLuys claims that momentary vertigo, often produced by changing from a\r\nhorizontal to a vertical position, seasickness, pain in movement in cases\r\nof meningitis, epileptic attacks at night, etc., may be by this\r\nexplained. These views of Luys are accepted as true, but to a less extent\r\nthan taught by Luys. The prevalent idea that a lesion of one hemisphere\r\nproduces a paralysis upon the opposite side of the body alone is no\r\nlonger tenable, for each hemisphere is connected with both sides of the\r\nbody by motor tracts, the larger of the motor tracts decussating and the\r\nsmaller not decussating in the medulla. Hence a lesion of one hemisphere\r\nproduces paralysis upon the opposite side of the body. It has recently\r\nbeen established that a lesion of one hemisphere in the visual area\r\nproduces, not blindness in the opposite eye, as was formerly supposed,\r\nbut a certain degree of blindness in both eyes, that in the opposite eye\r\nbeing greater in extent than that in the eye of the same side. Analogy\r\nwould indicate that other sensations follow the same law, hence the\r\nprobability is that all the sensations from one side of the body do not\r\npass to the parietal cortex of the opposite side, but that, while the\r\nmajority so pass, a portion go up to the cortex of the same side from\r\nwhich they come.\r\n\r\nDr. Hammond says that the chief feature of the new Siberian disease\r\ncalled miryachit is, that the victims are obliged to mimic and execute\r\nmovements that they see in others, and which motions they are ordered to\r\nexecute.\r\n\r\nDr. Beard, in June, 1880, observed the same condition when traveling\r\namong the Maine hunters, near Moosehead Lake. These men are called\r\njumpers, or jumping Frenchmen. Those subject to it start when any sudden\r\nnoise reaches the ears. It appears to be due to the fact that motor\r\nimpulse is excited by perceptions without the necessary concurrence of\r\nthe volition of the individual to cause the discharge, and are analogous\r\nto epileptiform paroxysms due to reflex action.\r\n\r\nThe term spiritualism has come to signify more than has usually been\r\nascribed to it, for some recent authors are now using the term to denote\r\na neurosis or nervous affection peculiar to that class of people who\r\nclaim to be able to commune with the spirits of the dead.\r\n\r\nEvidence obtained from clinical observations has tended of late to locate\r\nthe pathological lesions of chorea in the cerebral cortex.\r\n\r\nDr. Godlee's operation of removing a tumor from the brain marks an\r\nimportant step in cerebral localization, and cerebral surgery bids fair\r\nto take a prominent place in the treatment of mental diseases.\r\n\r\nWernicke has observed that the size of the occipital lobes is in\r\nproportion to the size of the optic tracts, and that the occipital lobes\r\nare the centers of vision.\r\n\r\nHughlings Jackson has observed that limited and general convulsions were\r\noften produced by disease in the cortex of the so-called motor\r\nconvolutions. The sense of smell has been localized by Munk in the gyri\r\nhippocampi, while the center of hearing has been demonstrated to be in\r\nthe temporal lobes. The center for the muscles of the face and tongue is\r\nin the inferior part of the central convolution; that for the arm, in the\r\ncentral part; that for the leg, in the superior part of the same\r\nconvolution; the center for the muscles and for general sensibility, in\r\nthe angular gyrus; and the center for the muscles of the trunk, in the\r\nfrontal lobes. In pure motor aphasia the lesion is in the posterior part\r\nof the left third frontal convolution; in cases of pure sensory aphasia,\r\nthe lesion is in the left first temporal convolution.\r\n\r\nThe relation of the cerebrum to cutaneous diseases has been studied much\r\nof late, and it is now held that the cutaneous eruptions are mainly due\r\nto the degree of inhibiting effect exerted upon the vaso-motor center.\r\n\r\nThe relation of the spinal cord to skin eruptions has been more\r\nthoroughly investigated and more abundant evidence supplied to\r\ndemonstrate the influence degeneration of the spinal cord has in causing\r\nskin diseases, notably zoster, urticaria, and eczema.\r\n\r\nThis rheumatism, pneumonia, diabetes, and some kidney diseases and liver\r\naffections are often the result of persistent nervous disturbance is now\r\nheld. That a high temperature (the highest recorded) has resulted from\r\ninjuries of the spinal cord, and where the influence of microzymes is\r\nexcluded, is not a matter of question. In one instance, the temperature\r\nreached 122° F., and remained for seven weeks between 108° and 118° F.\r\nThe patient was a lady; the result was recovery. Hence it cannot be fever\r\nwhich kills or produces rapid softening of the heart and other organs in\r\nfatal cases of typhoid. Fever, so far as it consists in elevation of\r\ntemperature, can be a simple neurosis.\r\n\r\nMany other items of progress might be presented did time permit,\r\nparticularly in the treatment of nervous affections, but this I leave for\r\nanother occasion.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSCARING THE BABY OUT.\r\n\r\n\r\nDr. Grangier, surgeon in the French army, writes from Algeria: \"A few\r\ndays after the occupation of Brizerte, when the military authorities had\r\nforbidden, under the severest penalties, the discharge of firearms within\r\nthe town, the whole garrison was awakened at three o'clock one morning by\r\nthe tremendous explosion of a heavily loaded gun in the neighborhood of\r\nthe ramparts; a guard of soldiers rushed into the house from whence the\r\nsound had come, and found a woman lying on the floor with a newly born\r\nbabe between her thighs. The father of the child stood over his wife with\r\nthe smoking musket still in his hand, but his intentions in firing the\r\ngun had been wholly medical, and not hostile to the French troops. The\r\nhusband discovered that his wife had been in labor for thirty-six hours.\r\nLabor was slow and the contractions weak and far apart. He had thought it\r\nadvisable to provoke speedy contraction, and, following the Algerian\r\ncustom to _scare the baby_ out, he had fired the musket near his wife's\r\near; instantanously the accouchement was terminated. After being\r\nimprisoned twenty-four hours, the Arab was released.\"--_Cincinnati\r\nLancet._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"ELASTIC LIMIT\" IN METAL.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe _Engineering and Mining Journal_ raises the question whether steel,\r\nwhich is becoming so popular a substitute for wrought iron, will, when it\r\nis subjected to continuous strain in suspension bridges and other similar\r\nstructures, do as well as iron has proved that it can. Recent tests of\r\nsections from the cables at Fairmount Park, Philadelphia, and at Niagara\r\nFalls show that long use has not materially changed the structure. The\r\n_Journal_ says: \"It is a serious question, and one which time only can\r\ncompletely answer, whether steel structures will prove as uniformly and\r\npermanently reliable as wrought iron has proved itself to be. In other\r\nwords, whether the fibrous texture of wrought iron can be equaled in this\r\nrespect by the granulated texture of steel or ingot iron. In this\r\nconnection it is interesting to note that the fibrous texture referred to\r\nis imparted to wrought iron by the presence in it of a small proportion\r\nof slag from the puddling furnace, and that this can be secured in the\r\nBessemer converter also if desired. The so-called _Klein-Bessemerei,_\r\ncarried on at Avesta in Sweden for several years past, produces an\r\nexclusively soft, fibrous iron by the simple device of pouring slag and\r\niron together into the ingot mould. This requires however a very small\r\ncharge (usually not more than half a ton), and a direct pouring from the\r\nconverter, without the intervention of a ladle, which would chill the\r\nslag.\"\r\n\r\nThe effect of the introduction of slag would seem to be to retrace the\r\nsteps usually taken in producing steel, viz., to separate the iron from\r\nits impurities, and then to add definite quantities of carbon and such\r\nother ingredients as are found to neutralize the effects of certain\r\nimpurities not fully removed.\r\n\r\nThe most intelligent engineers, after ascertaining by exhaustive physical\r\ntests what they need, present their \"requirements\" to the iron and steel\r\nmakers, whose practical experience and science guide them in the\r\nprotracted metallurgical experiments necessary to find the exact process\r\nrequired. The engineer verifies the product by further tests, and by\r\npractical use may find that his \"requirement\" needs further\r\nmodifications. As a result of all this care, some degree of certainty is\r\nsecured as to what the material may be expected to do.\r\n\r\nNo doubt the chemical composition of the slag used at Avesta was known\r\nand met some equally well known want in the iron, and thus the result\r\narrived at was one which had been definitely and intelligently sought.\r\n\r\nAn important factor in selecting material for the cables of suspension\r\nbridges is its _true elastic limit_. By this term we mean the percentage\r\nof the total strength of the material which it can exert continuously\r\nwithout losing its resilience, i.e., its power to resume its former shape\r\nand position when stress is removed. Now, in the case particularly of\r\nsteel wire as commonly furnished in spiral coils, the curve put into the\r\nwire in the process of manufacture seriously diminishes this available\r\nsustaining power.\r\n\r\nFor it is evident that it would be unsafe to subject these cables at any\r\ntime to a stress beyond their elastic limit. If, e.g., a snowstorm or a\r\ngreat crowd of people should load a bridge beyond this limit, when the\r\nextra weight was removed the cables could not bring the bridge back to\r\nits normal place, and the result would be a permanent flattening and\r\nweakening of the arch.\r\n\r\nBy a process invented and patented by Col. Paine, the wire in the New\r\nYork and Brooklyn bridge was furnished _straight_ instead of curved. Now,\r\nif a short piece of common steel wire is taken from the coil, and pulled\r\ntoward a straight position, and then released, it springs back into its\r\nformer curve; but if a short piece of the straight-furnished wire that\r\nwas put into this bridge is bent, and then released, it springs back\r\ntoward its straight position.\r\n\r\nIt is easy to see that if a curved wire is pulled straight, there must\r\noccur a distention of the particles on the inside of the curve and a\r\ncompression of those on the outside. The inside is in fact strained past\r\nits elastic limit before _any_ stress comes upon the outside. Hence,\r\nafter the wire has been pulled straight, the elastic limit of only a\r\nportion of it can be taken into the account in calculating the load that\r\ncan safely be put upon it. In the case of curved steel wire pulled\r\nstraight, its ultimate strength was found to be only about 90 per cent.\r\nthat of similar wire furnished straight by this process. The superior\r\nductility of iron wire in some measure compensates for the distention of\r\nthe particles on the inside of the curve, and that is a reason why it has\r\nheretofore been used for suspension bridges. But with straight steel wire\r\nthere is no such distention, and its _entire elastic limit_ is available.\r\nThis elastic limit is 66 per cent. of the ultimate strength, and,\r\nbesides, that ultimate strength is 10 per cent. greater than that of\r\nsimilar curved wire. Thus if we have a curved steel wire large enough to\r\nsustain 1,000 lb. without breaking, a similar straight wire, such as\r\nthose in this bridge, will hold up 1,100 lb., and 66 per cent. of this\r\n1,100 lb = 720 lb.\r\n\r\nThe elastic limit of curved wire has never been determined, since any\r\nstress that will cause it to reach a straight line is beyond the elastic\r\nlimit of the inside of its sectional area. That of curved iron wire has\r\nbeen estimated at 40 per cent. of its ultimate strength, which is about\r\nhalf the ultimate strength of curved steel wire; that is, it would be\r\nunsafe to put more than 40 per cent. of 500 lb.--or 200 lb.--upon a\r\ncurved iron wire when a _straight_ steel one can sustain 720 lb. without\r\ninjury. In the New York and Brooklyn bridge the cost of a sufficient\r\namount of such iron wire as is used in all other suspension bridges would\r\nhave been some $200,000 greater than that of the straight steel wire\r\nwhich was used. At five per cent., this effects an annual saving in\r\ninterest of $10,000.\r\n\r\nThere must, too, be a considerable saving in the current expense for\r\npainting and care, to say nothing of the more neat and elegant appearance\r\nof the less bulky steel. And as the whole area of the section of these\r\nwires is subjected to an even strain that is always far within the\r\nelastic limit, there is no danger of a change of structure under that\r\nstress.\r\n\r\nIt is highly probable--although Col. Paine has been too busy to work up\r\nthe matter--that piano wire made in this straight method could be drawn\r\nup to and kept at pitch, without approaching very near the elastic limit.\r\nIn that case not only would they seldom if ever require tuning, but\r\nprobably all along the tone would be more satisfactory. And there would\r\nnot be those exasperating periods when the pitch is not quite perfect,\r\nbut yet is not far enough out to make it seem worth while to send for a\r\ntuner.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nA catalogue, containing brief notices of many important scientific papers\r\nheretofore published in the SUPPLEMENT, may be had gratis at this office.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTHE SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN SUPPLEMENT.\r\n\r\nPUBLISHED WEEKLY.\r\n\r\nTerms of Subscription, $5 a Year.\r\n\r\nSent by mail, postage prepaid, to subscribers in any part of the United\r\nStates or Canada.
