Could the queer, sceptical old fellow return\r\nto earth again after his long quiet sleep of almost four centuries,\r\nhow astonished would he appear at the revelations of the students\r\nwho have followed his suggestion during the last century even! And\r\nyet in reality how little has been revealed to the limited vision of\r\nman, compared with the vast resources of nature still unexplored and\r\nshrouded in mystery. In enumerating the precious stones among the\r\nworks of nature worthy of the contemplation and earnest study of man,\r\nRabelais not only exhibited a prophetic discernment, but he disclosed\r\nthe fancies which invested these mineral objects in his day and in\r\nearlier times, and which have in a measure descended to the present\r\nera, and still exert some influence.\r\n\r\nThe study of the gems is one of the most interesting of all the\r\nobjects of natural history; and although the field of research appears\r\nsomewhat limited at first glance, the scene expands as we advance,\r\nand we are soon lost in the beauty and mystery of the subject, which\r\nas yet no man has been fully able to comprehend and explain. It is\r\ncommonly understood that this study is simply a matter of commerce,\r\nor belonging to the province of the jeweller or the mineralogist. But\r\nthe subject is really of far greater importance. Several of the ablest\r\nof our philosophers have been deeply interested in this pursuit, and\r\nhave revealed to us startling phenomena, many of which have been turned\r\ngreatly to the aid of science and the comfort of mankind. After so many\r\nyears of study and research, the field of observation and discovery is\r\nby no means exhausted.\r\n\r\nWe may take another view of the subject solely with the artistic eye,\r\nand find much for enjoyment and contemplation. In the art of ancient\r\ntimes the precious stones played an important part, and by means of the\r\nengraved gems we are enabled to form an idea of the wonderful skill\r\nof the artists of those periods. By means of these engraved stones\r\nthe portraits of many of the illustrious characters of antiquity have\r\nbeen preserved, and also representations of some of the masterpieces\r\nof sculpture, which have since been destroyed by time or the hand of\r\nbarbarism. If the reader, exercising a little credulity and patience,\r\nwill kindly follow me through the observations of many years here\r\ncondensed and recorded, he may in a slight degree partake of some of\r\nthe enthusiasm and interest of the author.\r\n\r\nBut, before we proceed very far on the pleasant and seductive journey,\r\nlet us understand each other, and, above all, allow the author to\r\nconfess that his knowledge of the subject is decidedly imperfect, and\r\nperhaps somewhat visionary at times.\r\n\r\nWe will consider first the diamond, not because we regard it the\r\nforemost in interest among minerals, but because it is to-day reckoned\r\ncommercially, as it was in the time of the Latin philosopher, Pliny,\r\nnearly two thousand years ago, “Maximum in rebus humanis,”--“The most\r\ncostly of human possessions.” But we must, however, slightly modify\r\nthe remark, and now apply it to the rare colored varieties of the gem,\r\nsince commerce and refined taste rank the red sapphire far above the\r\ncolorless diamond in value, and sometimes even the emerald and rare\r\nblue sapphires exceed it in price. It is interesting, and at times\r\namusing, to read the views of the ancient gem-writers, and even those\r\nof mediæval times, relating to this remarkable mineral, and compare\r\nthem with the accepted opinions of the present day. The ancients were\r\ncompletely ignorant of the nature of the stone, and called it “adamas,”\r\nor the invincible, from the mistaken idea that it could resist all\r\nexternal violence, and was also perfectly indestructible. Modern\r\nscience, however, has disclosed the fact that the gem is not only quite\r\ndelicate in its structure, but that it is also utterly perishable in\r\nits nature. The revelations of chemistry have clearly demonstrated that\r\nthe glittering stone, known as the diamond, is simply crystallized\r\ncarbon, and one of the allotropic forms of that protean element which,\r\nby the aid of some mysterious agency, can deposit its substance in\r\nthe shape of a sooty blackness, as in the coal, or in the transparent\r\ncrystal of diamond, which may be regarded as the very emblem of light.\r\nFurthermore, the gem is not only the concentrated embodiment of human\r\nvaluation, but it is also the standard of hardness among all mineral\r\nsubstances; and yet, strange to say, plumbago, which apparently is of\r\nthe same composition, is exactly the reverse, and quite as soft as talc.\r\n\r\nHere, then, we may behold one of the strangest antitheses to be seen\r\nin the whole mineral kingdom, for we have a simple and singular\r\nmineral composed of the meanest of elements, yet whose different forms\r\nillustrate the extremes of hardness, and may also be considered to\r\nrepresent the antipodes of material treasures.\r\n\r\nThe crystallized and transparent variety, when it occurs in its\r\ngreatest perfection, and especially with the rare colors of red, blue,\r\nand green, forms indeed the most beautiful of all the decorative stones\r\nyet known to man. For it not only far exceeds all others in degree of\r\nhardness, but it also surpasses them in its extraordinary brilliancy\r\nand the wonderful display of the prismatic colors, especially by\r\nartificial light, which charm it alone possesses of all the gems and\r\nprecious stones.\r\n\r\nAlthough it is widely distributed over the world, and has been known\r\nto man for many centuries, yet its distribution, its deposition, its\r\ngeological age, are not only puzzling themes to the mineralogist, but\r\nthey are yet subjects of startling interest to the philosopher.\r\n\r\nThe origin of the stone has long been a subject of inquiry among\r\nexperimentalists, and it has received more attention from them than\r\nall the other gems reckoned together. As for our humble opinion, after\r\nlong consideration of this multitude of hypotheses, we are inclined\r\nto assert the diamond to be the product of decomposition of vegetable\r\nmaterial, and derived from one of the numerous chemical compounds of\r\ncarbon and hydrogen. We find some of these forms generated wherever\r\nvegetable matter is decomposed under water, and in the gem strata of\r\nthe diamond placers we may observe abundant evidence of material for\r\nmetamorphosis. If we admit the origin of the gem to be from vegetable\r\nmatter, or derived from any transformations of organic débris, we then\r\nreduce the history of the diamond to a simple problem; for it is quite\r\neasy to explain, or rather imagine, the required chemical change under\r\nthe action of electricity or telluric magnetism, and all along the true\r\ngem formations the phenomena of the earth’s vitality in this respect\r\nare remarkable.\r\n\r\nCarbon is commonly mentioned as the meanest of elements, yet, when\r\nwe come to consider its bearing in the mineral kingdom, and its\r\nvast relations in human industry, or its effect in the progress of\r\ncivilization, it deserves a higher rank, or certainly a more generous\r\nclassification among the constituents of the earth. For it not only\r\noccurs in various states in the air, the sea, and the more solid\r\nportions of the earth, but we find it an essential ingredient in the\r\nstructure of all animal and vegetable life. It is really one of the\r\nmost interesting and important of the elementary bodies, and may\r\npresent itself in a variety of allotropic forms of remarkable and\r\nstriking character. To its combination in the mineral substance known\r\nas coal the world owes its greatest blessing, save the golden grains\r\nTriptolemus gave to mankind. From its purest and crystallized form art\r\nderives its richest and most dazzling object of ornamentation. Without\r\nit the globe would soon become desolate and all organic life cease to\r\nexist.\r\n\r\nIn contemplating the transcendent beauties of the purest of its states,\r\nthe observer can hardly realize that between the sparkling diamond and\r\nthe black, lustreless mineral known as graphite, there is only the\r\ndifference in the arrangement of their invisible atoms. Yet, so far\r\nas we know at the present day, the two objects are apparently of the\r\nsame composition, differing only in their system of crystallization.\r\nThe first we recognize as the perfection of natural beauty, the\r\nconcentration of brilliancy, and the standard of limpidity, while the\r\nother is directly the opposite in its effects and relations. The\r\ndiamond, when exposed to sufficient heat, parts with its wonderful\r\nbeauty and disappears, leaving only a minute trace of seemingly\r\ncarbonized matter.\r\n\r\nIt often perplexes the student in chemistry to explain the varied\r\nforms and the different properties of substances having apparently\r\nthe same composition. It is not especially in the mineral kingdom\r\nthat he meets with these strange anomalies, but his mystery becomes\r\nintensified when attempting to solve the problems of organic life. For\r\ninstance, in seeking to explain the odors of vegetable substances,\r\nhe finds that ten parts of carbon and sixteen of hydrogen appear to\r\nform the sole constituents of many perfumes,--like the oil of lemons,\r\nlavender, turpentine, etc. And yet, with the elements known, he not\r\nonly finds himself unable to combine them artificially so as to produce\r\nthe perfumes, or explain satisfactorily why bodies possessing the same\r\nconstituent parts exhale odors so different.\r\n\r\nAmong all these investigations and reasonings the question comes\r\nforcibly to the mind, why was the gem created, and has the day gone by\r\nwhen the conditions required for its formation no longer exist? With\r\ndue respect to the phenomena connected with the crystallization and\r\ndeposition of metals and minerals at the present time, we cannot answer\r\nthis inquiry hastily.\r\n\r\nWe may affirm, perhaps, that nature possesses the power to form the\r\ndiamond to-day, but are the conditions requisite for its evolution\r\npresent and complete? We will not now attempt to discuss the arguments\r\nbearing upon this interesting theme; but we will, however, modestly\r\nstate that it is our belief that the diamond is the last gem placed\r\nupon the earth, and that the period of its deposition was subsequent\r\nto the introduction of some of the higher forms of animal life on the\r\nglobe, and, possibly, since the appearance even of man.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER II.\r\n\r\n                  ANTIQUITY OF THE DIAMOND AS A GEM.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is quite certain that the diamond is not one of the earliest gems\r\nknown to man, and the facts of the stone not having been found among\r\nthe ruins of Nineveh or Bassora, the Etruscan sepulchres, or the\r\njewels of the ancient tombs of the Phœnicians of the island of Cyprus,\r\nrecently explored by Di Cesnola, afford strong presumptive evidence\r\nthat its discovery dates within historic times. As the gem in its\r\nnatural state is not often finely crystallized with smooth planes\r\nand perfect transparency, like the limpid crystals of quartz, it was\r\nprobably long overlooked by man, and its adoption in the decorative\r\narts preceded by the bright-colored and softer stones. The rough\r\ncrystals are not attractive when placed in comparison with many other\r\ngems, and their degree of hardness, coupled with their rarity, probably\r\ngave them their value among the ancients. We are inclined to think that\r\ntheir use was governed by the fancy of the rich and powerful nobles,\r\nand that the emerald and the blue and red stones took precedence in the\r\nselection of gems until the art of polishing was discovered.\r\n\r\nIn the time of Pliny the stone was acquired only by the richest of\r\nkings; and in the days of Alexander Severus, in the third century, it\r\nwas remarkable for its price, while the emerald was estimated for its\r\nbeauty. Lollia, at the Banquet of Caligula, glittering with the spoils\r\nof Asia Minor, of fabulous value, did not wear the diamond, so far as\r\nwe can ascertain.\r\n\r\nThere is evidence to lead to the presumption that the gem was regarded\r\nin the early periods more of a curiosity possessing talismanic powers\r\nthan as an ornamental stone. The famous crown of Chosroes, made in the\r\nlatter part of the sixth century, and brought to light by Shah Abbas\r\nafter a thousand years of concealment in an obscure fortress among the\r\nmountains of Lauristan, does not contain diamonds among its ornaments,\r\nbut is incrusted with pearls and rubies.\r\n\r\nThe absence of the stone in this royal tiara, constructed at this early\r\nperiod of time, is certainly significant, and indicates that it was not\r\nhigh in estimation, or that the art of polishing in a definite manner,\r\nso as to reveal the hidden splendors of the gem, had not then been\r\ndiscovered.\r\n\r\nThe early practice of polishing the natural faces of the crystal did\r\nnot reward the patient lapidary by a corresponding increase of beauty.\r\nHence we can explain the setting of rough diamonds in mediæval times\r\nlong after the process of polishing had been discovered and put in\r\npractice by the Orientals.\r\n\r\nThe crown of the Khan of the Tatars, captured on the Oxus by the\r\nPersians in the fifth century, is described as being ornamented with\r\nseveral thousand pearls, but there is no allusion to any stones\r\nresembling diamonds; yet the Tatars had undoubted access to the\r\ncommercial marts of India.\r\n\r\nThe cup of Chosroes I., of the seventh monarchy of Persia, and which\r\nis still extant, is composed of small disks of colored glass united\r\nby a gold setting, and having at the bottom a crystal engraved with\r\nthe figure of the monarch. This royal relic is destitute of diamonds.\r\nWhen the treasures of the Persian palace of Dastagherd were captured\r\nin the seventh century, no mention of the diamond was made in the\r\nenumeration of the articles. Among them were the famous throne of gold\r\ncalled “Takdis,” supported on feet composed of rubies; also the crown\r\nformed of a thousand huge pearls. If diamonds were abundant at this\r\nperiod, why do we not find them among the decorations of the royal\r\njewels? Macondi, however, says that the Sassanian king had nine seals\r\nof office, the first of which was a diamond with a ruby centre, bearing\r\nthe portrait, name, and titles of the monarch.\r\n\r\nThe sacred standard of Persia, the famous “durn-foh-Kawani,” or\r\nleathern apron of the blacksmith Kawak, which was eighteen feet long\r\nby twelve feet broad, was richly adorned with silk and the finest\r\ngems when it was captured by the Arabs in 636, at the great battle of\r\nCadesia. Its value was then estimated at $150,000, but the diamond is\r\nnot mentioned among its ornaments, and if it had been abundant we\r\nmight expect to see it prominently displayed among the decorations.\r\nHowever, we must admit that many of these historical descriptions\r\nare very incorrect, and often partake largely of the nature of the\r\nfabulous. And so, in the description of the capture of Ctesiphon by the\r\nArabs in the seventh century, the historian states that vast quantities\r\nof gems and precious stones and treasures of wondrous beauty, of more\r\nthan one hundred millions of dollars in value were obtained. Among the\r\ndescriptions of the articles comprised in this immense booty we fail to\r\nfind any allusion to the diamond, and yet we know that the gem was not\r\nunknown to Persians at that time.\r\n\r\nTo give the reader an idea of the magnificent tastes of the Persian\r\nnobles at that period, we will mention some of the articles captured at\r\nthis time by the freebooters of the desert.\r\n\r\nA wonderful carpet woven of white brocade is described as being one of\r\nthe marvels of the world. It was four hundred and fifty feet long by\r\nninety feet in breadth, and exhibited a border worked in with precious\r\nstones of various hues to represent a garden of all kinds of beautiful\r\nflowers. The leaves were formed of emeralds and other green colored\r\nstones, while the buds and blossoms were composed of pearls, rubies,\r\nsapphires, and other gems of immense value.\r\n\r\nThe captured robe of state was thickly embroidered with the most\r\nbeautiful rubies and pearls. The arms, helmets, and scimetars found\r\nin the royal treasury fairly flashed with the gleams of the rarest\r\nprecious stones, so thickly were they incrusted over the metal.\r\nAt a later period of the monarchy the Sassanian kings adorned the\r\nparaphernalia of their courts to a degree of magnificence which is\r\nalmost incredible. Some of the coins and sculptures yet extant have\r\npreserved faithful representations of their luxury in dress. Many of\r\nthe robes were beautifully embroidered and covered with gems and pearls.\r\n\r\nThe royal crown at this period, it appears, was not worn by the\r\nmonarch, but was suspended from the ceiling in the throne-room directly\r\nover the king’s head when seated on the throne.\r\n\r\nTheophrastus, a Greek writer living three centuries before the\r\nChristian era, does not mention the gem in a clear and distinct manner.\r\nIt is true he alludes to adamas, but it is now thought by several\r\nmineralogists that this term was then applied to steel and some of the\r\nvarieties of corundum. The descriptions of the splendid fêtes given\r\nby the army of Alexander at this period, when the wealth of India and\r\nPersia was brought forth to deck the Persian maidens, do not mention\r\nthe diamond.\r\n\r\nAt this period, and even in later times, the royal insignia and the\r\nemblems of Persian authority were such as wreaths and vines of pure\r\ngold laden with flowers and clusters composed chiefly of emeralds,\r\nrubies, carbuncles, and other bright-colored gems, but not including\r\nthe adamas. Of like description were those famous canopies under which\r\nthe ancient potentates of Persia sat and gave their audiences.\r\n\r\nPliny, three centuries later, was the first to describe the gem in\r\nunmistakable terms, but even then but very little of a definite\r\ncharacter was known of it.\r\n\r\nThe Romans had access at an early period to the gem-producing\r\ncountries. Ceylon and India had long been known to the Roman merchants,\r\nand their caravans traversed entire Asia from the coast of Syria to\r\nthe Chinese ocean in two hundred and forty-three days. Their fleets\r\nsailed regularly in the time of Claudian from the Red Sea to Ceylon,\r\nCoromandel, and Malabar. Ceylon was then famous for its luminous\r\ncarbuncles and the lustre of its pearls. The famous fairs of Armenia\r\nand Nisbis, which attracted the merchants of Asia, also furnished the\r\nRomans with many of their luxuries. There certainly were no serious\r\nobstacles to the introduction of the gem into the bazaars of the\r\nwealthy nations of the Mediterranean in early times and subsequent\r\nperiods if it was then an article of commerce.\r\n\r\nWith the ancient history of the gem there is also a remarkable fact to\r\nbe considered in its study,--its diminutive size. It is believed by\r\nmany antiquaries that the diamonds known or used by the Romans were\r\nwell-defined octahedral crystals, of not over four or four and a half\r\nkarats weight. It may be stated in reply that the exportation of larger\r\ngems may have been forbidden by the Hindoo rulers, as we have seen in\r\nlater times concerning the rubies found in Burmah. But we place but\r\nlittle confidence in this objection. Large and fine gems, had they been\r\nknown in the days of Roman prosperity and luxury, would surely have\r\nfound their way from time to time to the wealthy marts of the empire.\r\n\r\nThere is other evidence to found the belief that most, if not all, of\r\nthe diamonds of antiquity were of small size. The celebrated traveller\r\nand diamond merchant Tavernier boldly asserted in his day, that prior\r\nto the sixteenth century the largest diamonds seen in India were about\r\nten to twelve karats weight. Tavernier was well informed of the history\r\nof the gem, and had visited several times the most famous mines of\r\nIndia. We are inclined to support the views of the French traveller,\r\nand believe that the famous diamonds known as the paragons are of\r\nmodern discovery, or since the sixteenth century.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER III.\r\n\r\n                          DIAMOND LOCALITIES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe diamond is widely dispersed over the earth, and undoubtedly occurs\r\nin countries where its existence is not now suspected. The difficulty\r\nof detection has restricted its geographical area in history, yet\r\nenough is known to regard its deposition as almost universal, or at\r\nleast quite as frequent as that of gold. In some countries the deposits\r\nare very limited, while in others, like those of Africa, Brazil, and\r\nIndia, they stretch away over immense distances.\r\n\r\nWe will proceed to give brief descriptions of the well-known diamond\r\ndistricts, and mention others but little known to commerce or the\r\nmineralogists. For more extended accounts of the historical mines we\r\nmust refer the reader to the works of the authors quoted in our text.\r\nWe will commence with those of Asia.\r\n\r\nThe diamond fields in India are very extensive, and occur everywhere\r\namong the hills of the great range that extends from Cape Comorin\r\nthrough the whole of Bengal for a distance of several hundred miles and\r\nwith an average breadth of fifty miles.\r\n\r\nHow long these mines have been known to man must always remain a matter\r\nof conjecture; but it is nevertheless certain that the famous mines\r\nhave been discovered within the past thousand years, and probably a\r\nmuch less period of time. It is stated that many of the gem districts\r\nalong this range have not been explored carefully, and that the\r\nkingdoms of Golconda and Visapour alone have supplied most of the gems\r\nknown in India. And it is also related that none of these localities\r\nhave been scientifically mined or surveyed with a view to thorough\r\ndevelopment.\r\n\r\nThe most ancient of the diamond mines in India are supposed to be those\r\nof Soumelpour, near the river Gonet, a tributary of the Ganges; but the\r\ncelebrated mines of Golconda and Raolconda have been known only since\r\nthe fifteenth and sixteenth centuries.\r\n\r\nThe richest mine of India, and the most extraordinary of any yet\r\ndiscovered in the world, is that known by the name of Gani, or Couleur.\r\nIt is situated under a plain at the foot of a mountain about seven\r\ndays’ journey west of Golconda, and was discovered by accident about\r\nthe middle of the sixteenth century.\r\n\r\nA native digging the earth to sow millet threw up a bright, clear\r\ncrystal of twenty-five karats. It was soon recognized to be a diamond,\r\nand crowds of Hindoos flocked to the fields to reap the most wonderful\r\nharvest of gems yet known. A vast number of large gems were obtained,\r\nand among them the Great Mogul, which weighed in its rough condition\r\nseven hundred and ninety-three karats. The gems of this mine were\r\nremarkable for their large size, but they were not of the clearest and\r\npurest water, the color and lustre of the stone seeming to partake of\r\nthe quality of the earth composing the matrix.\r\n\r\nThis idea, which prevails among the miners in other gem districts in\r\nIndia and also in other countries, lends support to the belief that\r\nthe diamonds were formed in the strata of gravel where they are now\r\nfound, and not in the hard crystalline rocks and afterwards set free by\r\ndisintegration.\r\n\r\nThe matrix of these mines, as well as of all the others in different\r\nparts of the world, is essentially the same; and consists of rolled or\r\nbroken masses of quartz, mixed or united with sand or earth impregnated\r\nwith a ferruginous oxide. Amongst this conglomerate, or immediately\r\nbelow it, mixed with clay, the diamonds are found, and generally\r\nunattached to any substance.\r\n\r\nThe earliest and best accounts of the mines of Golconda are to be\r\nfound in the narrative of Tavernier, who visited them in the middle\r\nof the seventeenth century. At this time they were in prosperous\r\ncondition and furnished occupation to many thousand men. There were\r\nbut four mines then worked in Hindostan, and more than sixty thousand\r\nminers were employed at the mine of Gani, or Couleur, alone. About\r\nthirty years after the last visit of Tavernier, the Earl Marshal of\r\nEngland, who had previously examined the diamond mines on the coast\r\nof Coromandel, visited those in Bengal. He found that diamond mines\r\noccurred everywhere along the slope of the hills extending through the\r\ncountry; but that very few of them were worked, and that nearly all of\r\nthe diamonds then supplied to commerce were obtained from the kingdoms\r\nof Golconda and Visapour. He gives descriptions of twenty-three mines\r\nin Golconda and fifteen in Visapour.\r\n\r\nThe most famous of these at that time was called Currure, and was\r\nworked by the king for his own use. Several very large gems are said\r\nto have been found at this locality. It is related that a Portuguese\r\ngentleman from Goa, having received permission to explore a part of\r\nthis mine, had the good fortune to discover a diamond of two hundred\r\nand six karats, which so overjoyed him that he erected a large stone\r\nover the spot with an inscription in Hindoo commemorative of the event.\r\n\r\nNear this place there was another famous mine which yielded stones\r\nof fine form and water, occurring in black earth, which is regarded\r\nin India as a singular formation. In all the mines of Visapour the\r\ndiamonds are found in red and yellow earth, and this is generally the\r\ncolor of the matrix elsewhere.\r\n\r\nWilliam Methold visited the mines of Golconda at a later period, and\r\nrelates that at that time they gave employment to about thirty thousand\r\nlaborers. The means for exploration were then exceedingly simple,\r\nand no mechanical contrivances were adopted for excavating the pits\r\nor bailing out the water. Shafts were rudely sunk in the earth to the\r\ndepth of sixty or seventy feet, and the cascalho found at even that\r\ndepth. It appeared to be reddish, mixed with white and yellow chalk,\r\nand was rich in diamonds. Rarely, stones of one hundred and twenty to\r\ntwo hundred karats were found, while those of ten to fifteen karats\r\nwere quite abundant; but by far the greater number were so minute that\r\nit required from eight to twenty of them to weigh a karat.\r\n\r\nWithin the present century Dr. Buchanan and Mr. Voysey visited the\r\nmines of India, and have left interesting and accurate descriptions of\r\ntheir examinations and observations.\r\n\r\nThe famous mine of Pannah was examined in 1813, and found to be\r\nsituated in a table-land of great extent a thousand feet or more above\r\nthe Gangetic plain. The whole plain, wherever the gravelly formation\r\nappeared, afforded diamonds at various depths ranging from six feet\r\nto twenty-four. Many mines were worked in beds or borders of rivers\r\nbecause they were easy of access, and the lazy natives lacked the\r\nability and means to explore the adjacent plains, which abounded in\r\ndiamonds, but were destitute of the water required for washing the\r\ngravel.\r\n\r\nThe effect of the Brazilian discovery and its yield of several tons of\r\ndiamonds was severely felt in Hindostan, and many of its mines were\r\nstopped in consequence. Yet there is abundant virgin territory left in\r\nIndia for future successful exploration, if conducted scientifically\r\nand with ample means.\r\n\r\nThe natives, with their rude methods of mining, generally ceased\r\noperations when the deposit required the removal of twenty-four feet of\r\nsuperincumbent soil. Hindoo labor, also, though apparently very cheap,\r\nis in reality costly when we come to compare their slow and feeble\r\nresults to the efforts of well organized and conducted operations.\r\nHence the diamond has always been a costly gem in Hindostan, and it is\r\nworth more in that country at the present time than in Europe.\r\n\r\nConcerning the widespread idea of the reproduction of diamonds in India\r\nwe will make only a brief allusion at the present time.\r\n\r\nThis theory does not seem to be of a very recent date, for the\r\nPortuguese traveller Garcias, who had been physician to the Viceroy at\r\nGoa in the early part of the sixteenth century, and who visited the\r\nmines, has left in his treatise published in 1565, some curious notes\r\non the rapid generation of diamonds at that time. And he affirms that\r\nthe soil a few feet below the surface will, in the interval of two\r\nor three years, produce diamonds again; but he also admits that the\r\nlargest gems are only found at much greater depths.\r\n\r\nMr. Voysey, who examined the principal mines in Southern India in 1821,\r\nwas also assured by the miners of this reproduction; and from his\r\ninvestigations he was led to adopt similar views.\r\n\r\nDr. Buchanan in 1813 visited the famous Pannah mine, and these views\r\nthen prevailed at that locality. He examined the diamond-bearing earth,\r\nbut observed nothing very peculiar in its formation. It seemed to be\r\nvery red, and characterized by pebbles stained by iron and a great\r\nvariety of quartz in broken fragments, chiefly white in color, or\r\nstained red in places, or dotted with black spots.\r\n\r\nThe miners who were then operating the mines assured the Doctor “that\r\nthe generation of diamonds is always going forward, and that they\r\nhave just as much chance of success in searching earth which has been\r\nfourteen or fifteen years unexamined as in digging in what has never\r\nbeen disturbed; and in fact,” he says, “I saw them digging up earth\r\nwhich had evidently been before examined, as it was lying in irregular\r\nheaps as thrown out after examination.”\r\n\r\nBorneo is thought to be rich in diamonds, but concerning the extent\r\nand productiveness of the placers but little definitely is known. The\r\nisland has long been known as abounding in the gem, but travellers\r\nand mineralogists have been prevented from exploring it by a variety\r\nof causes, chiefly arising from opposition of the native rulers and\r\ndifficulty in penetrating into the interior of the country where the\r\nmines are found.\r\n\r\nTavernier was desirous of visiting these mines, but was dissuaded from\r\ngoing by these supposed or fancied difficulties, and the fact that the\r\nQueen at that time forbade the exportation of the gem. Therefore we\r\nhave to regret the absence of the report which this able and truthful\r\ntraveller would have made if he had visited those regions.\r\n\r\nThe Borneo diamonds are reported to be the best in the world, and to\r\nowe their excellence to a faint steel-like tinge and a very vivid\r\nadamantine flash. We are inclined to think, however, that diamonds of\r\nthis description may be found in various countries, and that commerce\r\nassigns their locality to Borneo as a matter of convenience and trade.\r\n\r\nBorneo is yet a _terra incognita_, and its features have not yet been\r\nmade known to geography or even commerce. The second island in size in\r\nthe world, and itself almost a continent, it presents a vast field to\r\nthe explorer, with its broad prairies, immeasurable forests, deep and\r\nimpenetrable jungles, interspersed with lofty ridges of mountains. Its\r\nmineral wealth is undetermined, but enough is known to found the belief\r\nthat the island is one of the richest in this respect on the globe.\r\n\r\nConcerning the diamond mines we have but imperfect accounts and none\r\nof very recent dates. However, it is known that the character of the\r\nmines is the same as that of India and elsewhere, and that the gems\r\nare found in a gravelly stratum at various depths below the surface.\r\nThe best of these mines are said to be situated along the river Lavi,\r\nnear Sukkademia, and to be worked in a rude manner by the Malays\r\nand Chinese. Mines on the northwest coast of the island have been\r\nworked extensively, but it is reported that no large diamonds have\r\nbeen discovered there. The Colonial Secretary, Mr. Low, states that\r\nthe gems are found in the greatest quantities in Sango, Landak, and\r\nBanjarmassin, and that the stones, although of small size, are of the\r\npurest water.\r\n\r\nThe quantity of diamonds afforded by Borneo is not exactly known, but\r\na recent writer in the Journal of the Geographical Society of London\r\ngives it as about two thousand karats annually. It is also stated by\r\nvarious authorities that the mines of the island have never yet yielded\r\na diamond of thirty-six karats in weight.\r\n\r\nIf these reports are correct, how can we explain the accounts of the\r\ngreat diamond belonging to the Sultan of Mattan, which may be found in\r\nthe History of Java, by Sir Stamford Raffles, and also in the Memoirs\r\nof the Batavian Society?\r\n\r\nThe famous mines of Brazil, which gave rise to a new era in the\r\ncommerce and history of diamonds, were discovered by accident. And\r\nwe are not aware of an instance of the discovery of a single diamond\r\ndistrict or region of country, with the exception of the Urals, which\r\ncan be ascribed to the results of scientific research. Even the\r\nwonderfully rich mines of the Province of Bahia in Brazil were first\r\nmade known by a slave who noticed the similarity of the soil to that\r\nof the diamond mines of Minas Geraes, where he had formerly worked.\r\n\r\nIn 1727 a Portuguese by the name of Lobo, while visiting the gold mines\r\nof the Sierra do Frio, a desolate country about four hundred miles\r\nnorth of Rio Janeiro, noticed some bright crystals of stone which the\r\nignorant miners picked up from time to time and treasured as trifles.\r\nGathering a number of them, he submitted them to some Dutch traders,\r\nwho informed him as to their valuable character. The Dutch at once\r\ncontracted with the Brazilian Government for all of the rough diamonds\r\nthat might be found, and for a long time controlled the trade. The\r\nmines where the gems were first discovered were situated in the midst\r\nof a desolate country destitute of vegetation and of considerable\r\nelevation above the level of the sea. Since this period other mining\r\ndistricts have been discovered, and it is now ascertained that the\r\nwhole of the vast territory situated between the twelfth and twentieth\r\nparallels of latitude and extending even to Matto Grosso, a thousand\r\nmiles distant, belongs to the gem-bearing formation.\r\n\r\nThis vast space of territory has not been examined scientifically,\r\nand but little is known of its condition except that it is diamond\r\nyielding. Since their discovery the mines have been worked with more\r\nor less activity with slave labor under the direction of companies of\r\nlarge capital. Skilled labor with the modern appliances of science has\r\nnot yet been employed in these mining districts. And the condition\r\nof the country, its laws, and the controlling power of the diamond\r\ncorporations, will render the application of scientific skill a\r\ndifficult and hazardous task. The explorations are conducted in a\r\nprimitive manner during the dry season, which lasts from April to\r\nOctober. They are made generally in the beds of the streams which have\r\nbeen dried up by the summer’s drouth. Rivers are sometimes diverted\r\nfrom their natural course, and their gravelly beds completely removed\r\nto sheds on the banks to await the rainy season, when water, which is\r\nrequired for washing, will be in abundance. The cascalho, a name given\r\nto the peculiar gravel, composed of quartz fragments mixed with sand\r\nand clay united with a ferruginous cement, which contains the diamonds,\r\nis then placed in shallow troughs, and a stream of water directed upon\r\nit until it is well cleansed, when it is removed and dried in the sun.\r\nThe dried residue is then carefully searched for diamonds, and it is\r\nnot always easy to distinguish them among a great variety of pebbles,\r\nof which the _débris_ is chiefly composed.\r\n\r\nSome of the diamond mines were of great extent and required many\r\nlaborers to conduct the operations. That of Mandanga employed twelve\r\nhundred slaves in its excavations alone, besides many free persons\r\nengaged in other duties. The yield of the Brazilian mines at first was\r\nenormous, and one thousand one hundred and forty-six ounces of the\r\nprecious gem were shipped to Lisbon in one year. The vast quantities\r\nof the gem thrown upon the markets brought the price of them down to\r\nfive dollars per karat.\r\n\r\nConsternation speedily spread among the diamond dealers all over the\r\nworld; and many of them, believing that the gems would soon be as\r\ncommon as transparent quartz, declined to invest largely, even at\r\nthese low prices. But a panic was checked by the prompt action of\r\nthe Brazilian Government, in claiming the working of the mines as a\r\nroyal monopoly, and also regulating the supply. In this condition of\r\naffairs the working of the mines and the trade remain at the present\r\nday; but the African discoveries and free explorations may change\r\nthis restriction and monopoly if the Cape fields continue to yield\r\ntheir present supply. According to the estimates of Baron d’Eschwège,\r\nthe quantity of diamonds obtained from the Brazilian mines under the\r\nGovernment restrictions averaged between 1730 and 1814 thirty-six\r\nthousand karats annually, the cost of which amounted to nearly four\r\ndollars per karat.\r\n\r\nFrom a variety of causes the supply gradually diminished until about\r\nthe year 1830, when the diminution was so great, coupled with the\r\nincreased cost of exploration, that the rough stones cost eight dollars\r\nper karat. In 1843 the discovery of the Bahia mines increased greatly\r\nthe yearly supply, which was then about thirty thousand karats. For two\r\nyears after the discovery of the Sincora mines the supply amounted to\r\nsix hundred thousand karats. But the great distance of the mines from\r\nthe large towns and the coast, the fearful malaria which prevailed\r\nin the district, together with the difficulty of obtaining supplies,\r\nhave prevented the working of the mines to any great extent; and in\r\nconsequence the supply in 1852 sank to one hundred and thirty thousand\r\nkarats. In 1732 the price of the rough gem was five dollars per karat,\r\nbut in three years after it rose to about eight dollars per karat, and\r\nremained at that figure as late as 1742.\r\n\r\nThe Brazilian diamonds are generally very small compared with those\r\nyielded by some of the India mines, like that of Gani, which produced a\r\ngreat many gems of ten to forty karats weight. Of the Brazilian yield\r\nit was found by Professor Tennant that out of one thousand diamonds,\r\none half weighed less than half a karat; three hundred, less than one\r\nkarat; eighty, one and a half karats; one hundred and nineteen varied\r\nfrom two to twenty karats, and only one reached twenty-four karats.\r\n\r\nBrazil still exports annually diamonds to the value of several millions\r\nof dollars, but the exploration has probably been checked by the influx\r\nfrom South Africa and the consequent fall in prices.\r\n\r\nOut of the immense number of gems yielded by these mines,--the district\r\nof Minas Geraes is said to have produced two tons in weight,--it is\r\nstrange that more large gems have not been found.\r\n\r\nQuite a number of diamonds exceeding fifty karats have been\r\ndiscovered, and several over one hundred karats, the largest being\r\nknown as the Star of the South, which weighed two hundred and\r\nfifty-four karats. This fine gem was found in 1853 in the mines of\r\nBegagem by a negress. It was in the form of a dodecahedral crystal.\r\nAnother fine gem, called the Abaethe, was found in 1797 in the alluvium\r\nof the river Abaethe. Three convicts, banished into the interior of the\r\nsavage country, wandered about from thicket to thicket and mountain\r\nto mountain, in hope of discovering some treasure that would restore\r\nthem again to their friends. After six years of weary wanderings and\r\nsevere privations they at length stumbled upon a diamond of one hundred\r\nand five karats in the bed of the river above named. They ventured\r\nto return to the inhabited regions and confided their good fortune\r\nto a priest. He took them at once to the Governor of Villa-Rica, who\r\nsuspended the sentence of the convicts and sent the priest to Rio\r\nJaneiro with the gem.\r\n\r\nA frigate was despatched with the treasure and the clergyman to Lisbon.\r\nThe King, delighted with his acquisition, fully pardoned the convicts\r\nand advanced the priest to a high rank in his profession.\r\n\r\nMany attempts have been made to trace the diamonds of Minas Geraes to\r\nprimitive and unbroken rocks on the more elevated plateaux or even\r\namong the more distant mountains. And sometimes the gems have been\r\nfound in cascalho at a great elevation, or perhaps in crevices of the\r\nsandstones; and hence the idea has arisen that the solid matrix has\r\nbeen found. The cascalho is the true matrix, whether found in the\r\nlowlands or on the mountain peaks. The color of this conglomerate is\r\nnot uniform and varies in many districts. At the rich St. Antonio’s\r\nmine it is of a dark gray; at the Veneno it is of a light ochre with\r\nlumps cemented with ferruginous oxide; in the Pitanga mine it is of\r\na light gray and almost white, and contains but few diamonds, but of\r\nthe finest quality. The observer is sometimes led to believe that the\r\nabundance of the ferruginous oxide is evidence of the abundance of\r\ngems, and this fact is also noticed in the famous mines of Ceylon,\r\nwhere, however, the diamond does not occur.\r\n\r\nConcerning the accounts of finding the diamonds in Brazil in their\r\nnative rock, as described by Claussen and later still by Redington,\r\nwe are not yet willing to give full credence any more than to the\r\nstories of diamonds having been found in the “old rock” in India. We\r\nhave no doubt of the gem having been found in what appears to be a\r\nsoft sandstone, but which is in reality a secondary product like the\r\nheterogeneous cascalho. And we can conceive this sandstone-like deposit\r\nto be formed at the bottom of lagoons under like conditions which gave\r\norigin to the conglomerate.\r\n\r\nClaussen published in the Bulletins of the Academy of Sciences and\r\nBelles-lettres at Brussels, in 1841, an interesting account of his\r\nobservations while searching for a matrix of the diamond.\r\n\r\nHe affirms that the gems are found at the mines of Grammagon in beds\r\nof a soft sandstone, which he calls a psammite sandstone, and which\r\nresembles the itacolumite, which is much harder. He also describes\r\nseveral specimens in which the gems are embedded in the sandstone,\r\nbut admits that they are not very common. The same writer mentions\r\ninstances where they are said to have occurred between plates of mica\r\nlike the flattened garnets. Furthermore, he states that the crystals\r\nfound in the itacolumite are rounded octahedrons and those found in\r\npsammite sandstone are perfect octahedrons.\r\n\r\nClaussen, although he believed the itacolumite to be the matrix of\r\nthe gem, was unable to explain its total absence in places where the\r\nitacolumite was greatly developed. He was also forced, when tracing\r\nthe origin of the cascalho, to admit the existence of a secondary\r\nitacolumite posterior to the transition formation.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting as well as perplexing to follow the multitude of\r\nviews expressed by mineralogists when attempting to explain the\r\nformation of the diamond. Most of them are determined to give the\r\ngem an ancient origin, and insist upon the action of plutonic forces\r\nupon dioritic veins. Humboldt maintained that the gems of the Ural\r\nMountains had a geological relation to the carboniferous dolomite of\r\nAdolfskoi as well as to augitic porphyry. But Verneuil and Murchison,\r\nexamining the mines, found the alluvia which contained the diamonds\r\nhad no carbon; therefore the hypothesis was incorrect, and the matrix\r\nof the stone must be sought in another direction. The mines of Brazil\r\nhave been examined during a century past by a number of geologists and\r\namateurs like Mawe, Martins, St. Hilaire, Claussen, Eschwège, Burton,\r\nHartt, and others; and to their works we must refer the reader for\r\nextended descriptions of the geological features of the country and the\r\npeculiarities of the gem mines.\r\n\r\nIn the recent exploration of the diamond fields by Professor Hartt, the\r\nProfessor decidedly opposes the views of Claussen by saying, “I do not\r\nbelieve that the diamond ever occurs in the true palaeozoic itacolumite\r\nin Brazil, but that it is derived from the tertiary sandstones.”\r\nAfter casual examination of the diamond-bearing sands of the mines\r\nin Bahia, he is also led to believe that they have resulted from the\r\ndisintegration of Chapada sandstones; and he regrets that they have\r\nnever been critically examined, for he thinks that the mystery of the\r\norigin of the diamond may be solved from their study.\r\n\r\nHowever, from the multitude of hypotheses to which the study of the\r\nsubject has given rise, we find nothing to shake our confidence in the\r\nbelief of the formation of the diamond in the secondary gravel beds\r\nwhere they are now found.\r\n\r\nShortly after the opening of the Bahia mines, black, brown, and even\r\nclay-colored pebbles were found associated with the transparent\r\ndiamonds in the cascalho. These pebbles were of various sizes,\r\ngenerally quite small, but sometimes appearing in masses as large as\r\none thousand karats. Their nature was not at first recognized, and they\r\nwere thrown aside with all other stones of little or no value. Finally\r\na quantity was gathered and sent to a merchant in Paris, where they\r\nwere seen by Count de Douhet. The Count in 1867 presented a notice\r\nof them to the Academy of Sciences and pronounced them to be massive\r\ncarbon, and a variety of the diamond. The exact localities in Brazil\r\nwhere it occurs we are unable to describe, but believe them to be\r\nsituated in the Province of Bahia. As to the quantity gathered we are\r\nalso unable to give a definite opinion, but have reason to think that\r\nit is quite limited; and, moreover, we have yet to learn that it occurs\r\nin any other diamond mines in the world.\r\n\r\nThe color of the carbon, or carbonado, as it is called by the\r\nBrazilians, is generally black, but it may be light-brown or of a\r\ngreenish gray color, when diluted with clay. It is always opaque, but\r\nis not always compact, being sometimes quite porous, like pumice-stone.\r\nIt never crystallizes, but generally appears in angular pieces in lumps\r\nor concretionary masses whose specific gravity is 3 to 3.4, while that\r\nof the transparent diamond is 3.5.\r\n\r\nThe black and perfectly crystallized diamond, which is very rare, is\r\nnot to be confounded with this variety.\r\n\r\nThe hardness of the carbon is equal to that of the transparent diamond,\r\nand probably some of the purest and most compact specimens are harder\r\neven than the limpid variety; for the black gems are generally harder\r\nthan the light-colored, and we have for instances the deep-blue\r\nsapphire, the black tourmaline, etc.\r\n\r\nAt first this newly discovered mineral was pulverized, and its powdered\r\ndust used to polish diamonds and other gems, and was then sold for a\r\nfew francs the karat. Lately, however, science has applied its use to\r\nnew inventions; and the demand for it in its application to the drill\r\nand the saw has increased its value to several dollars the karat, and\r\nthe price is still increasing. Its advantages over the crystallized\r\nvarieties are very decided, and it is as hard and has no cleavage\r\nplanes, and is therefore far better able to resist the effects of shock.\r\n\r\nThe only diamond known to have been found in modern times in Western\r\nEurope is that picked up in a brook in the County of Fermanagh in\r\nIreland. Its weight was not given, but it was stated to be of a reddish\r\ncast and valued by Mr. Rundell at twenty guineas. Some mineralogists\r\nhave maintained that the stone in question was not in place and was\r\nprobably brought in the crop of some bird of passage from Brazil or the\r\ntropical countries of America.\r\n\r\nTo us, however, a more plausible and probable theory would be that the\r\nstone was in place, and that its presence is no more remarkable than\r\nthe gold nuggets found in the same country. In fact, this instance\r\nis no more strange than the finding of the great American diamond\r\nin Virginia, which was also a solitaire and many miles below the\r\nauriferous fields whence it is supposed to have drifted. We shall not\r\nbe surprised to learn of the occurrence of diamonds in other parts\r\nof Europe. Pliny ends his chapter on the diamond by stating on the\r\nauthority of Scepsius that diamonds are found in Germany and in the\r\nisland of Basilia along with amber.\r\n\r\nEastern Russia was long ago suspected of being diamondiferous; and as\r\nearly as 1826 Maurice Englehardt pointed out the resemblance of the\r\nUral districts to those of Brazil. It was, however, left to Humboldt\r\nand his companions to make known the actual occurrence of these gems\r\nin this country. For in 1829, during their visit to Siberia, they\r\ndiscovered several diamonds on the estates of Count Porlier, about one\r\nhundred and sixty miles west of Perm, on the western declivity of the\r\nUral Mountains. Active search having been instituted, forty diamonds\r\nwere found in the detritus on the banks of the Adolfskoi. Strange to\r\nrelate, they were discovered in the gold-bearing alluvium twenty feet\r\nabove the stratum containing bones of mammoths and rhinoceroses. Since\r\nthis period they have also been found at several other places along the\r\nUralian chain.\r\n\r\nIn commenting upon the occurrence of these diamonds of the Adolfskoi\r\nwhich are preserved in the collection of Prince Butera, some of our\r\nbest geologists have come to a startling conclusion.\r\n\r\nHumboldt, Sir Roderick Murchison, and M. Verneuil, obtaining\r\ninformation from different points in Siberia, have been led to the\r\nbelief that the diamond in these localities was formed at a date\r\nsubsequent to the destruction of the mammoths.\r\n\r\nSince this period Colonel Helmersen has made known other points along\r\nthe Uralian chain of mountains where the gem has been found, as\r\nEkaterinsburg, Kushvinsk, and Versch-Urak. But we have no information\r\nof “placers” of any considerable extent having been discovered, or\r\nthe finding of the gem in sufficient numbers to warrant systematic\r\nexplorations.\r\n\r\nFuture research may reveal other localities in Siberia where this gem\r\noccurs, for the country was known to the ancients as furnishing the\r\nadamas.\r\n\r\nAmnian in the fourth century mentions the region of Agathyrsi as one of\r\nthe gem-bearing countries; and this country included the Ural Mountains\r\nand part of Siberia. It is not at all strange that the exact localities\r\nshould have been forgotten during the long intervening space of time\r\nand the many political convulsions that have interrupted commercial\r\nintercourse with those far-off regions.\r\n\r\nIt was well known that Scythia furnished the ancients with gold for\r\ncenturies; but in modern times all trace of the localities was lost\r\nuntil revealed by the researches of German miners exploring for copper\r\nand iron. Stranger still, the locality of the gold mines in Spain, so\r\nfamous in ancient times, is unknown at the present day.\r\n\r\nThe gold fields of the Southern States of North America have been\r\nknown to be diamond-bearing for forty years or more, but as yet no\r\nearnest or well-directed search has been made for the gems. During\r\nthis period of time more than thirty diamonds have been picked up by\r\naccident along the gold belt which extends from the central and eastern\r\nportion of Alabama, through Georgia, North and South Carolina, even\r\nto the interior of Virginia. All along this auriferous formation the\r\nitacolumite appears in the gravel beds or in ledges or even in large\r\nmountains in some localities.\r\n\r\nIn Alabama, where the itacolumite is abundant, several fine diamonds of\r\nthree or four karats weight have been found.\r\n\r\nThe northeastern portion of Georgia has also yielded some beautiful\r\nstones to the miners while washing for gold. Some of these we have\r\nseen and found them to be of the purest water. The Glade mines, a few\r\nmiles north of Gainesville, have yielded several fine diamonds, some\r\nof which have been cut in London. They were found by accident in the\r\nriffles of the gold-washing machines, and were preserved by the miners\r\nsimply as curiosities. At the Horshaw gold mines, a few miles farther\r\nto the northeast, a large diamond was picked up, but unfortunately\r\ndestroyed by the ignorance of the laborers, who unluckily reasoned\r\nlike the ancients concerning its destructibility, and therefore tried\r\nthe effects of a heavy sledge upon it while placed on an anvil. An\r\nexamination of this last deposit in 1866 convinced the writer that it\r\nwas a true diamond field; and search was rewarded with the finding of\r\ntwo small but well-crystallized diamonds. So far as we can ascertain,\r\nall the diamonds thus far discovered in these regions have been finely\r\ncrystallized.\r\n\r\nNorth Carolina has also yielded some fine specimens of three and four\r\nkarats weight; but the largest diamond thus far found in the United\r\nStates and preserved was picked up in 1856 on the banks of the James\r\nRiver, opposite the city of Richmond in Virginia. The spring floods\r\nhad probably washed it down from the gold fields which are situated a\r\nfew miles above. The stone was a well-defined octahedral crystal. Its\r\nweight, while in the rough state, was about twenty-five karats, and\r\nits color was of a faint greenish white tinge. Its transparency was\r\nperfect, but its refractions were somewhat impaired by a flaw or a\r\nspeck in the interior.\r\n\r\nThe American diamond-cutting establishment of Morse, Crosby, & Foss, of\r\nBoston, cut this gem very successfully at the cost of about $1,300. The\r\nstone was purchased by a distinguished American athlete in New York,\r\nand worn by him in a breast-pin for many years.\r\n\r\nNone of these diamond fields have been examined systematically by\r\nexperienced miners with a view to their development, and in fact no\r\ndefinite idea of their limit or their value can be given. But we have\r\nthe impression that they are far more extensive than has been imagined\r\nby mineralogists. The returning gem-seekers who have been educated\r\nin the diamond mines of South Africa may investigate ere long these\r\nunknown districts and settle the question beyond further inquiry. In\r\nCalifornia, a few diamonds are reported to have been found here and\r\nthere among the gold fields, but nothing like a gem placer has yet\r\nbeen revealed. The geological formations of Arizona and New Mexico are\r\nmore promising than any part of the United States, and explorations\r\nmay disclose extensive and valuable gem deposits in those regions.\r\nThe originators of the famous diamond swindle in Arizona chose their\r\nlocality with more than ordinary sagacity.\r\n\r\nThe account of this daring scheme reads more like romance than reality,\r\nand it was more than ordinary boldness that prompted the perpetrators\r\nto visit foreign lands, purchase quantities of rough diamonds and then\r\nplant them in a distant, desolate, and hostile country to entrap the\r\nwary speculator. The success of this piracy was fortunately checked\r\nby the sagacity of one of the United States geologists exploring the\r\nadjacent territory, who quickly disclosed the fraud, but not in time\r\nto prevent the swindlers from pocketing large sums of money from\r\nspeculators in California.\r\n\r\nPliny mentioned Arabia as one of the localities of the gem; but modern\r\ninvestigators believe that he founded his views on the facts of the\r\ndiamonds being obtained from Arabian merchants, and that they really\r\ncame from other countries.\r\n\r\nThis probably is the true version of the commerce of the Arabians\r\nin those days; but we see no objection to the belief that Arabia\r\nmay have been a diamond-bearing country in early times, and may\r\npossess undeveloped fields at the present day. Northern Africa was\r\nalso asserted to be diamond yielding, and modern investigators have\r\nestablished the truth of the assertion.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1867 the attention of gem-seekers was turned to vague\r\nreports of the discovery of rich diamond fields in South Africa, and\r\nthe pages of history were examined closely to prove that in ancient\r\ntimes this continent was known as a diamond country. It is undoubtedly\r\ntrue that Africa yielded diamonds to the ancients, for within thirty\r\nyears several have been found in Algiers, and are now preserved in\r\nthe collections of Paris. They were discovered in the auriferous\r\nsands of the river Goumal, in the Province of Constantine, by natives\r\nwhile washing for gold. They were small in size but of unmistakable\r\ncharacter. This discovery strengthens the ancient report of the\r\nCarthaginians’ procuring the gems from the Etrurians, who brought them\r\nfrom the interior of Africa.\r\n\r\nIn 1867 a diamond was discovered by accident in the soil several\r\nhundred miles north of the Cape of Good Hope. The report was not\r\ncredited, and it was not until a number had been found and tested that\r\nthe attention of adventurous men was fairly aroused. Success soon\r\nrewarded the labors of the first bands of gem-seekers; and the news,\r\nwidespread over the world, soon brought thousands of determined and\r\nhardy men, who are even yet earnestly exploring the gem districts and\r\nalso revolutionizing the country.\r\n\r\nThe gem mines now under process of exploration are situated on the\r\nVaal River and its tributaries, the best of them being found near the\r\njunction of the Vaal and Orange Rivers and from five to six hundred\r\nmiles north of the Cape. The locality known as Du Toits Pan soon\r\nbecame famous and yielded a great number of diamonds, some of them\r\nover 100 karats and one reaching the great weight of 288³⁄₄ karats.\r\nThe topography of the country around these mines is characterized by\r\nlow, flat-topped hills, which strike the observer at once by their\r\nsingularity. The storm clouds, their frequency, their dull gray hue,\r\ntheir constant commotion, and the nearness of their approach to the\r\nearth are also quickly noticed by the new-comer, so strangely different\r\nare they from the ordinary atmospheric changes.\r\n\r\nFive miles to the north of Du Toits occurs one of the most remarkable\r\nmines yet discovered in any part of the world. It is called Colesberg\r\nKopje, and although one of the richest spots of the globe, it is also\r\none of the meanest places on God’s earth. Several thousand men have\r\nbeen actively engaged upon it for a number of years past, and many\r\nthousand diamonds have been taken from it. So rich has been its yield\r\nthat it is stated that four thousand have been obtained in a single day.\r\n\r\nThe extent of the excavation is enormous, and yet all has been done by\r\nsimple and even rude means. But little advantage has been taken of the\r\nuse of machinery and skilled labor, and most of the operations have\r\nbeen conducted in a primitive manner. The distance to the coast and the\r\ngreat expense of transportation is perhaps the principal reason why\r\ndifferent and more satisfactory arrangements have not been made.\r\n\r\nThe photographs of the appearance of this field and its excavations\r\nstrike one with amazement. The countless array of tents in the distance\r\non the borders of the deposit; the thousands of busy miners; the huge\r\nand deep ditches stretching across the plain, vast enough to float a\r\nfleet of men-of-war; the lofty mounds of thrown-up earth,--all together\r\npresent a startling picture never to be forgotten.\r\n\r\nThe depths of these enormous ditches vary from ten to more than one\r\nhundred feet.\r\n\r\nAll this herculean labor has been performed in less than twenty years\r\nunder the stimulus of extraordinary prosperity, and it indicates a\r\ndetermination to explore the country thoroughly.\r\n\r\nAs yet there has been no complete survey of these regions, and the\r\nextent of the diamond fields is still unknown. Sufficient evidence,\r\nhowever, has been received to indicate that they cover an area of one\r\nthousand square miles, and are situated principally in the Orange\r\nRiver Free State, but also extend into the Transvaal Republic and Cape\r\nColony. These districts alone will afford remunerative labor for some\r\ntime to come, and we have little doubt but that other fields of even\r\ngreater extent will before long be discovered in other parts of Africa.\r\n\r\nFor a long time past we have been led to regard this continent as\r\ncontaining the most extensive and richest diamond deposits on the\r\nglobe. A great portion of Africa belongs to the geological conditions\r\nwhich produce the diamonds, and the present explorations will educate\r\na host of gem-seekers, who will not only investigate other parts of\r\nAfrica, but will also explore other countries. Therefore we may expect\r\nthe diamond trade to receive a strong impetus for some years to come,\r\nand that new mines may for a time reduce the present prices of the gem.\r\n\r\nThe largest diamond yet afforded by the South Africa mines is that\r\ncalled the Stewart. It was found at Waldeck’s plant, in November, 1872,\r\nby a man named Antonies. Its form was that of a modified octahedron,\r\nbeautifully crystallized, and exhibiting a faint tinge of yellow.\r\nOn the outside of the crystal were a few specks and flaws, but the\r\ninterior appears to be free from imperfections. Its original weight was\r\n288³⁄₈ karats.\r\n\r\nA vast number of the diamonds found in these fields are tinged with a\r\nfaint hue, generally yellow or faint brown. This peculiarity was also\r\nnoticed with the yield of the Brazilian mines.\r\n\r\nIt is quite impossible to give a correct account of the quantity\r\nafforded by these mines up to the present time. It amounts to many\r\nmillions of dollars, and is sufficiently large to produce a marked\r\neffect upon the market, but nothing like the panic which followed the\r\ndiscovery of the Brazilian mines. The value of the diamonds exported at\r\nCape Town in 1871 is said to have been $7,500,000, but it was probably\r\nmuch greater.\r\n\r\nAustralia has afforded to the gold miners quite a number of small\r\ndiamond crystals, and gem fields undoubtedly occur within its\r\nborders. Among the auriferous sands of the Maguarie River minute\r\ncrystals have been picked by the careless miner from time to time,\r\nand other localities have also afforded specimens of the mineral, but\r\nno systematic search has yet been made for them. A number of these\r\nspecimens of diamonds, although of minute form, were exhibited at\r\nMelbourne in 1865.\r\n\r\nThe islands of Java and Sumatra yield diamonds among their mineral\r\ntreasures, but, strange to say, the island of Ceylon, which is the\r\nmost remarkable gem deposit in the world, does not produce a single\r\nspecimen. The island is not far distant from the gem districts of lower\r\nBengal. The formation appears to be of the same character, but it is\r\nevident that the geological conditions which deposited the sapphire,\r\nthe zircon, spinel, etc., differed from those required by the diamond.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\n                        ORIGIN OF THE DIAMOND.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe origin of this precious stone has been a favorite study with man\r\nfrom the earliest times of its history; and, as we have already stated,\r\nit has given birth to a multitude of hypotheses.\r\n\r\nThe peculiar fascination which attends the contemplation of the gems\r\narises partly from their commercial distinction, as well as from\r\ncertain mysterious properties with which they have been invested not\r\nonly by tradition but even by scientific research.\r\n\r\nWe will not, however, venture to affirm that they are more wonderful or\r\ndeserving of a higher place in the estimation of man than the beautiful\r\nand more transient flowers of vegetation. Both are indeed objects of\r\nour highest consideration.\r\n\r\nThe transparent diamonds always occur in crystalline forms, although\r\nthey sometimes appear almost amorphous or even cylindrical or globular.\r\nIts primitive form, however, is the octahedron.\r\n\r\nThey are found generally in limited deposits, which are often as\r\nshallow and well defined as the gold fields, which are termed placers;\r\nand therefore we will also call the diamond fields “diamond placers.”\r\n\r\nIn some “placers” the shapes of the crystals are perfectly regular,\r\nwhile in others they are greatly modified and rendered indistinct. In\r\nsome mines they occur in fine octahedrons with beautifully truncated\r\nedges, but in other districts the rare form of the regular cube may\r\nabound. Every section of the diamond-bearing countries seems to have\r\nsome peculiarity either in color, form, or arrangement of crystal. It\r\nis indeed true that experts, from an examination of the rough specimen,\r\nare sometimes able to detect the locality whence the diamond was\r\nobtained. The same facility may be applied to the natural crystals of\r\nother gems, but it cannot be established as a fixed or general rule.\r\nThe diamond “placers,” distinct and well defined, are far more numerous\r\non the earth’s crust than is generally believed.\r\n\r\nA thousand plausible and often ingenious theories on the geological\r\ncharacter of the diamond have been advanced in modern times or within\r\na century past; and a great variety of rocks or mineral substances\r\nextending from itacolumite to xanthophyllite have been affirmed to be\r\nthe parent mineral. The real matrix, or such as we believe it to be,\r\nof the diamond is the same all over the world. The associate minerals\r\nwhich form the conglomerate in which it is generally found may vary\r\nsomewhat, but the character of the deposit is but little changed. This\r\nmatrix is a secondary product, and consists of a conglomerate gravel\r\nwhich once abounded in remains of animal and vegetable life.\r\n\r\nThe keen eye of Buffon early detected the formation of the true gem\r\nstrata; and believing that the gems were produced in these peculiar\r\nbeds by the solar forces, he boldly asserted that they were formed in\r\nthe superficial strata from _débris_ of older formations, mineral,\r\nanimal, and vegetable. “On ne peut leur donner d’autre origine, d’autre\r\nmatrice que la terre limoneuse qui rassemblant les debris des autres\r\nmatieres.”\r\n\r\nThis matrix is a well-defined conglomerate, which is found generally\r\non elevated plateaux, and which corresponds to the bottoms of shallow\r\nlagoons or lakes of inconsiderable depth. In the earthy portion, which\r\nis composed of a variety of _débris_, occur the diamonds, interspersed\r\namong the quartz or rock pebbles, and in a marked and continuous layer.\r\nThese formations are well known to the geologist, for they occur in\r\nalmost every country on the globe.\r\n\r\nIn various parts of the earth’s structure we find solid strata\r\nof conglomerate and sandstone, which have been formed at distant\r\nand different periods of the world’s history. In other places we\r\nmay observe the loose materials of the same formation awaiting\r\ntransformation when exposed to the action of water highly charged with\r\niron, lime, or silica, and we may even see the process taking place at\r\nthe present day. For example, we will take the broad tracts of level\r\ncountry known in the south of France as the “Landes.” Here we have an\r\nexcellent illustration of the formation of the gem beds, lacking,\r\nhowever, the precious stones. Below the surface of these plains, and\r\ngenerally at the depth of about three feet, a conglomerate called\r\n“allios” has formed, and is still in the process of forming. This stony\r\nlayer, which is composed of quartz pebbles mixed with sand, has been\r\ncemented strongly together by the vegetable and organic matter which\r\nhas trickled down from the surface of the earth during indefinite\r\nperiods of time. The action of this organic _débris_ soon renders the\r\nconglomerate quite impervious to water, and retards its passing into\r\nthe sand beds or other strata below. In consequence thereof these broad\r\ntracts of level lands become stagnant lagoons of water during the rainy\r\nseasons, and all the remains of vegetable and other organic life sink\r\ndown into these layers of stone, gradually filling up the interstices\r\namong the rocks and lesser pebbles.\r\n\r\nThis collection of decayed various organic substances is generally\r\nof a gray or blackish color, or may be of a rusty yellow-hue like\r\nferruginous sandstone. Its cementing power has given a special name\r\nto the formation it has caused; and to the gold-miner it is known as\r\nhard-pan, to the gem-seeker as cascalho or “mellan.” Its peculiar hue,\r\ntogether with the metallic fracture of its layers, has given rise to\r\nthe belief that it was composed chiefly of a ferruginous oxide. Recent\r\nanalysis, however, of the “allios” has shown that this idea is partly\r\nerroneous, and that the color and the substance of the formation\r\nin reality arises from the juice and _débris_ of plants loaded with\r\ntannin and other matter. Iron, it seems from these investigations, is\r\npresent only in small quantities, and also is afforded by the secretion\r\nof vegetable life. However, the quantity of iron in the conglomerate\r\nvaries considerably in different localities, but most of it seems to be\r\nacquired from the action of vegetable vitality.\r\n\r\nThese conglomerates of the Landes have been a long time in process of\r\nformation; but in other localities, like those of the Cape de Verde,\r\nto which the waves of the sea have had access, we may witness the\r\ntransformation going on with rapidity. No great time is required by\r\nnature for this production, but rather the application or conjunction\r\nof certain materials exposed to the action of chemical changes and\r\ntelluric forces.\r\n\r\nIt has been asserted that the diamond has been found embedded in\r\nthe singular quartzite to which Count D’Eschwège gave the name of\r\nitacolumite, but we are inclined from examination of one of these\r\nspecimens to think that its presence is quite accidental.\r\n\r\nIn the State of Georgia there are immense beds of itacolumite,\r\nappearing, also, here and there along the auriferous formation which\r\nextends from Virginia to central Alabama; and they afford ample fields\r\nfor proof of the statement that the mineral is really the true matrix\r\nof the gem. But, after careful examination of some of these exposed\r\nrocks, we are led to regard the itacolumite as an associate mineral\r\nto the diamond, and that any farther connection with the gem is very\r\ndistant. Fragments of this rock are quite often found together with\r\nquartz in the conglomerate; but we do not regard their presence\r\nas essential as that of a ferruginous oxide, which is one of the\r\ndistinguishing features of all gem mines, and especially of the famous\r\ndeposits of Ceylon, where the diamond is never found.\r\n\r\nThe best and most characteristic mines of India, Brazil, and Africa are\r\nsituated on elevated plateaux, where there is at present but little\r\nvegetation.\r\n\r\nTo give the reader an idea of the formation, we will describe one\r\nof the districts of South Africa, which may serve to illustrate all\r\nothers. At Pnict Kopje, in the Vaal region, the diamonds are found\r\non an elevated plateau one hundred and fifty feet above the river\r\nbed; and many of them have been discovered but two or three feet\r\nbelow the surface, in company with fossil wood and even bones. In the\r\nOrange River Republic they occur frequently in peculiar isolated and\r\ncircumscribed spots, called by the miners “pans.” These are basin-like\r\nhollows which are filled with water during the wet seasons. In these\r\npans none of the diamonds exhibit signs of abrasion caused by shock\r\nor attrition, although the quartz pebbles forming the gravel and\r\nconglomerate show in their rounded angles evidences of aqueous action.\r\nThe gems are not only found in the shallow edges of these hollows,\r\nbut are taken from depths of one hundred feet and more. And they are\r\nalways found in their peculiar and connected conglomerate, which seems\r\nto have formed at the bottom of some pool or lake. Hence we may explain\r\nthe superficial depth of the cascalho at the shores of the extinct\r\npond, and the increased depth at central parts of the fields. If motion\r\nhad taken place among the pebbles forming the conglomerate after the\r\ndeposition of the diamond, we might properly look for worn surfaces on\r\nthe gems from shock with contact with loose rocks; for slight blows\r\nwill mar the surface of the diamond, even if its edges scratch all\r\nother minerals with perfect ease.\r\n\r\nIn these pans the diamonds are natural in form, indicating that they\r\nhave not moved since the time they were deposited. But in the beds of\r\nthe rivers which have in later times worn deep ravines in the face of\r\nthe country we find diamonds with abraded surfaces, having been rolled\r\nabout by the torrents for indefinite periods of time. Whence come the\r\nalluvial soils and the gravel beds which cover the gem strata and\r\ncompletely fill up the lake depression, especially when there are no\r\nsurrounding elevations to furnish disintegrated material?\r\n\r\nThis serious question will naturally arise in the minds of all\r\nobservers; and to answer it clearly will be a difficult task. Sometimes\r\nthe thought occurs to us that much of the quartz gravel has formed in\r\nthese pools at subsequent periods and has been broken up and rolled\r\nabout by the waves until another stratum of alluvium has formed above\r\nit; but we will not venture to assert an opinion to this effect.\r\nStill, it is a great mystery to ascertain whence some of the quartz\r\npebbles came from in the present elevated condition of the placers and\r\nthe absence of similar rocks in the vicinity. There is another fact\r\nconnected with the diamond placers which deserves consideration, and\r\nthat is their great elevation above the sea level.\r\n\r\nThe mines of India, Africa, and Brazil are situated at a considerable\r\naltitude above the ocean. Those of India are generally a thousand feet\r\nabove the sea level; while the wonderful gem mines of the adjacent\r\nisland of Ceylon, which are also true placers, occur but few feet above\r\nthe line of the tides, but do not yield the diamond. It is certainly\r\nremarkable that Ceylon does not afford this gem among the great number\r\nof other precious stones. At first thought the idea occurs to the\r\nobserver that as flora and fauna have their distribution according to\r\ncertain elevations a similar rule may be applied to the deposition of\r\nminerals. But there are too many exceptions known to oppose this view,\r\nhowever pleasing the theory may be.\r\n\r\nOne of the strongest arguments in favor of the theory of the recent\r\ndeposition of the gem is connected with its discovery in the gold mines\r\nof the Adolfskoi in Siberia. Here they were found in alluvial strata\r\ntwenty feet above those deposits which contained the bones of the\r\nmammoth and the rhinoceros. Hence Humboldt, Murchison, and Verneuil\r\nwere led to the conclusion that they had been deposited there since the\r\nintroduction of animal life. There are also some remarkable evidences\r\nto sustain the view that these gems were formed in the conglomerate\r\nand earth where they are now found. In some of the mines of India they\r\nhave been taken out of red earth with the earth clinging to their\r\nsides as if it had become attached to them, while the crystals were\r\nof a soft, glutinous substance. In the Museum of Rio Janeiro there is\r\na large rounded diamond which has very distinct impressions of grains\r\nof sand upon its sides. The British Museum contains an octahedral\r\ncrystal attached to alluvial gold, and Dr. Nello Franka mentions\r\nanother which enclosed a leaf of gold. A number of specimens have been\r\nobserved containing splinters of ferruginous quartz and crystals of\r\nother substances. The microscope often reveals in the interior of these\r\nstones germs of fungi and even vegetable fibres of higher organization,\r\nsome of which resemble the moss-like appearance seen in the moss agates.\r\n\r\nIt was from the study of these conditions, connected with the fact\r\nthat the stone becomes black when strongly heated, that Goppert was\r\nled to assert that it could not be of igneous origin. It was also\r\nfrom investigation of the refractive powers of the gem that Sir David\r\nBrewster was induced to assume the hypothesis that it was, or that\r\nit might be, a congealed secretion of a vegetable production. This\r\ndistinguished philosopher was seeking a perfect lens for microscopic\r\nuse; and discovered that the diamond, notwithstanding its immense\r\nrefractive power, was of very doubtful character in its adaptation\r\nto this purpose, and that its laminæ were sometimes of different\r\nshades and even arranged in a series of stratification. They not only\r\ndiffered from each other in color and purity, but did not exhibit a\r\ncommon focus. Therefore, Brewster was led to infer from these and other\r\nphenomena that the mineral was of vegetable origin, and that its parts\r\nmust have been held in solution before crystallization took place.\r\n\r\nThere is nothing very startling in this hypothesis, no more so than\r\nin the case of the amber, which is now admitted to be a fossil resin,\r\nand which is, in its refractive powers, second only to the diamond.\r\nTherefore we cannot object to the theory of vegetable origin on account\r\nof the property of brilliancy.\r\n\r\nTavernier observed that the color of the diamonds in India\r\noften partook of the color of the gravel in which they were\r\ndeposited,--white, reddish, blackish, or greenish, according to the\r\ncolor and purity of the matrix. This fact has also been noticed in\r\nBrazil; and it lends support to the view that the gems have been\r\ndeposited under stagnant water, and have received some tinge from its\r\ncolor.\r\n\r\nThe diamond is admitted by microscopists to be one of the foulest gems\r\nknown to them; and specimens are rare that do not exhibit cavities,\r\nimperfections, or foreign matter in their interior. A painstaking\r\nmicroscopist, after examining the large collection of rough crystals\r\nof the East India Company in London, which numbered several hundred\r\nspecimens, came to the following conclusion: “It seems to be a general\r\ntruth that there are comparatively few diamonds without cavities and\r\nflaws, and that the diamond is a fouler stone than any other used in\r\njewelry.”\r\n\r\nBerzelius first called attention to a black substance which he found in\r\na diamond belonging to the collection of Countess Porlier; and since\r\nthen many other examples have been observed. Frequently black specks\r\nresembling anthracite have been noticed in the Brazilian diamonds.\r\nTavernier saw in India a large diamond of one hundred and four karats,\r\nwhose central portion was so foul as to render the stone worthless.\r\nWhen it was cut open the cavity yielded about eight karats of filth,\r\nresembling that of a rotten weed.\r\n\r\nThe diamond is now recognized by the chemist as a crystalline form\r\nof pure carbon. Newton, in 1675, with the wonderful penetration of\r\nhis genius, and reasoning from the high refractive power of the gem,\r\nwhich so far exceeded the degree due its density, believed it to be\r\ncombustible. More than a century later the experimentalists of the\r\nAcademy of Florence strengthened this view by destroying it in the\r\nfocus of powerful burning mirrors. Lavoisier, however, dispelled\r\nall doubts concerning its combustibility by burning it under a\r\nreceiver filled with oxygen gas. It has since been ascertained that\r\na temperature of 14° Wedgewood completely volatilizes the diamond,\r\nproducing carbonic acid gas. An English experimentalist, however, has\r\nrecently declared that the gem may be consumed at a red heat, and\r\nmaintains that he has accomplished this result by enveloping the stone\r\nin certain alkalies.\r\n\r\nIt has been admitted by eminent geologists that the diamond proceeded\r\nfrom the slow decomposition of vegetable material, and even animal\r\nmatter, as the requisite carbon could be obtained from either source.\r\nBut they have also strenuously maintained that the gem was formed\r\nunder the same conditions of heat as produced the metamorphism of\r\nargillaceous and arenaceous schists, these schists being supposed\r\nto have once been altered from shales impregnated with carbonaceous\r\nsubstances of organic origin. To this theory the revelations of the\r\nmicroscope offer decisive objections, since this instrument shows that\r\nthere has been no action of heat in the formation of the stone, for the\r\nvegetable remains often detected in the interior of the mineral forbid\r\nthe development of any considerable degree of caloric. Therefore, as\r\nthere is no evidence of the influence or effect of heat upon these\r\norganic matters within the diamond, the theory must be abandoned.\r\n\r\nGeologists have been, perhaps, too tenacious in their views of the\r\norigin of many of the rocks that compose the earth’s crust, and\r\nespecially in maintaining that many crystalline rocks are as old\r\nas the dawn of creation. We know that some of these minerals may be\r\nproduced artificially at the present day, and that the forces that\r\narranged all rocks of a high molecular organization are still in force.\r\n\r\nWe sometimes speak of old crystalline rocks with the inference that\r\ntheir age is beyond comparison, and therefore undetermined. Yet\r\nthe microscope is constantly lessening the force of these views by\r\nrevealing prodigious numbers of minute and animal forms in fossil\r\ncondition in various kinds of crystalline rocks.\r\n\r\nWe also observe that various forms of silex have been deposited on the\r\nearth in recent periods of its history, and even since the appearance\r\nof animal life, for we find their remains transformed into agate. Thus\r\nit is evident that nature still possesses the power to deposit certain\r\nforms of mineral substances.\r\n\r\nArago and Biot, reasoning from the energy of the refractive power of\r\nthe diamond, were inclined to believe that it contained hydrogen. Sir\r\nHumphrey Davy suspected the presence of oxygen, but sought for it in\r\nvain after many careful experiments. Chaucourtois, however, deriving\r\na theory from chemical results, came to the view that the stone is\r\nderived by the humid process from a hydrocarburet. Reasoning from the\r\nprocess of forming sulphur from hydro-sulphuretted emanations, he\r\nbelieved that in the humid oxidation of a carburetted hydrogen the\r\nhydrogen is oxidized, while part of the carbon becomes carbonic acid,\r\nand the rest remains as carbon and may crystallize into diamond.\r\n\r\nSupposing this hypothesis to be correct, where do you find the required\r\nmaterials for the formation of the diamond? the reader may ask. At\r\nthe bottom of these lagoons the decomposition of organic matter\r\nfurnished abundant means for the production of the gem. Carbonic acid\r\nis everywhere produced from the decomposition of animal and vegetable\r\nmatter. It is constantly evolved from the earth, and has the property\r\nof decomposing many of the hardest rocks. It is the cause of that\r\nmysterious decay which Dolomieu called “La maladie du granite.”\r\n\r\nIn carburetted hydrogen we have the united force of two of the most\r\nactive substances known as organogens, or generators of organic bodies.\r\nBut of the vast range of their properties, their affinities, and their\r\ninterior changes we are still profoundly ignorant. We may, however,\r\neasily recognize the fact that their combinations and also almost every\r\nother chemical compound may be decomposed by electricity or galvanism.\r\n\r\nHere then we have a clew, though perhaps distant, to the formation\r\nof the gem. Is not the production of drops of water by passing the\r\nelectric spark through a mixture of hydrogen and atmospheric oxygen\r\nsuggestive of the manner in which the diamond might be formed from\r\ncarburetted hydrogen? It is true this experiment in the laboratory\r\nhas failed to produce the transparent and crystalline form of carbon,\r\nalthough it has thrown down the element in an amorphous state. This\r\nfailure is by no means decisive, for many of the simple acts of nature\r\nare beyond the imitative power of man.\r\n\r\nAnd then again the chemist may exclaim, “How is it possible for the gem\r\nto be produced in this manner, when the combination of these elementary\r\nbodies is always or nearly always attended with the development of a\r\nconsiderable degree of heat, while the diamond contains at times germs\r\nof organic matter? Would not these organic remains be destroyed during\r\nthis process? On the contrary, they do not exhibit the least trace of\r\nthe effect of combustion or even heat, and are as well defined as the\r\ninsects in the fossil resins.” In reply we will point to the formation\r\nof fulgurites through the agency of the lightning without the evolution\r\nof heat.\r\n\r\nHistory presents some almost incredible examples of the stupidity and\r\nobstinacy of mankind in the explanation of natural phenomena. It seems\r\nquite impossible that when the German philosopher Chladni, less than\r\na century ago, asserted that meteorites were extra-terranean bodies,\r\nthe Academies of Europe laughed at him in scorn. Several meteoric\r\nshowers falling in Europe shortly after did not convince the bigoted\r\nphilosophers. And when Pictet in 1802 read a paper before the French\r\nInstitute in favor of the theory, he was insulted by his learned\r\naudience. It was not until a year afterwards, when the great meteoric\r\nshower occurred in Normandy, that Biot, deputized by the French\r\nGovernment, succeeded in convincing the most sceptical. Yet only a few\r\nyears previous De Luc, the first meteorologist of Europe, the founder\r\nof geology, declared that he would not believe it even if a stone\r\nshould fall at his feet from the skies. In 1751, Peysonnel presented\r\nto the Academy of Sciences at Naples an elaborate memoir in which he\r\nvery plainly proved that the coral belonged to the animal and not\r\nthe vegetable kingdom. But his admirable paper was hooted at by the\r\nEuropean naturalists; and even the distinguished philosopher Reaumur\r\ndeclared that the idea which was advanced was really too absurd to be\r\ndiscussed.\r\n\r\nWhen we come to review the hypotheses of science during the last\r\ncentury, we shall feel more inclined to be generous and flexible in our\r\nviews of natural phenomena.\r\n\r\n  “There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio,\r\n  Than are dreamt of in your philosophy.”\r\n\r\nThe nodular or globular forms of the gem present no serious objection\r\nto the idea of vegetable or animal origin; and we may refer for\r\nargument to the calcareous nodules of the old red sandstone. These\r\nconcretionary and radiated masses are merely sarcophagi of animal\r\nremains; and their arrangement plainly shows the chemical influences\r\nof decaying animal matter and also the multiple and varied effect\r\nof crystalline attraction and electric force. Can we say that the\r\ncrystallized diamonds occurring in well-defined placers are any\r\nmore remarkable than the little globular petrifactions found in the\r\ncretaceous formation and known as the _Coscinopora globularis_, and\r\nwhich nature provided with a perforation so that ancient man adopted\r\nthem as ornaments in place of beads?\r\n\r\nWe are often reminded by the antiquary of the remarkable foresight or\r\nacuteness of the ancient poet Lucretius in his explanation of certain\r\nnatural phenomena which have since been verified by modern science. But\r\nof all the heaven-inspired dreamers none have come nearer the truth in\r\nterrestrial matters than the Arabian poet Fizee, who wrote:--\r\n\r\n  “The sun from whom the seven seas obtain pearls,\r\n  The black stone from his rays obtains the jewel,\r\n  The mine from the correcting influence of his beams obtains gold.”\r\n\r\nPlato believed that the gems were produced by a sort of vivifying\r\nspirit descending from the stars. It is undoubtedly from the influence\r\nof the solar forces and the magnetic and electric currents which are\r\nconstantly playing through the crust of the earth that the gems derive\r\ntheir origin.\r\n\r\nThese phenomena of the earth’s vitality are manifested in their\r\ngreatest force along certain elliptics, which may be traced over the\r\ntrue gem districts of Asia, Africa, and Brazil, and in marked contrast\r\nto adjacent territories. The miners in South Africa, disturbed by the\r\nsevere whirlwinds and frequent thunder-storms, soon began to imagine\r\nthat the excessive electric action had something to do with the\r\ncreation of the gems they sought. Mr. Voysey, Geologist to the India\r\nSurvey, also observed the very marked telluric action in the diamond\r\nformations of India, and moreover that the process of crystallization\r\ntook place there with wonderful rapidity. So convinced was this\r\nkeen observer of the present reproduction of gems in the alluvial\r\nsoil or conglomerate that he commenced to collect the proofs of\r\nrecrystallization. Unfortunately for science, Mr. Voysey died shortly\r\nafter he adopted these views. Dr. Buchanan, another traveller who\r\nvisited many of the mines of India, was impressed with this idea; and\r\nhe was assured by the miners all over India that the regeneration of\r\ndiamonds is always going on in the peculiar gravel. In proof of their\r\nstatements, many men were then engaged in working over the _débris_\r\nthat had been examined many years before. An interval of fifteen years\r\nwas sufficient in their estimation to reproduce new gems, at least to a\r\ncertain extent. This reproduction, or rather, we will say, assertion of\r\na reproduction, reminds one of the mysterious action of the nitre beds,\r\nwhich yield rich returns after a rest of a few years, and especially\r\nthose which occur among rocks which are destitute of potash.\r\n\r\nIt is to the learned Abbé Haüy we owe the theory that crystals are\r\nmade up of an assemblage of minute parts or molecules, each having the\r\nsame definite form. To the diamond especially this hypothesis may be\r\napplied, since it is composed of thin laminæ covering or concealing\r\nits primary form. With the aid of the skill of the artisan we can\r\nremove these coverings one after the other, until the definite and\r\nelementary form of the crystal be revealed. In the time of Louis\r\nXIV. it was thought that the size of diamonds might be increased by\r\nplacing them in certain solutions, as crystals of salt are enlarged by\r\nimmersing them in solutions of the same substance. But the difficulty\r\nthen was to find the required liquid; and even at the present day we\r\nhave not yet succeeded in discovering the composition of the water of\r\ncrystallization of crystals of quartz or topaz, although Nature has\r\nshown the fluid to us in the cavities of certain crystals.\r\n\r\nThese curious speculations which were discussed in the days of the\r\n“Grand Monarque” are again revived by the theory that gold nuggets are\r\nnot only deposited from aqueous solutions, but are actually increasing\r\nin size under certain influences and conditions.\r\n\r\nBut where does this metal come from? the inquirer may ask. From a\r\nvariety of sources, we may reply. Does not the water of the ocean\r\ncontain it in appreciable quantities, and did not M. Sage extract\r\nit from the ashes of certain burned vegetable substances? We also\r\nknow for a certainty that iron is produced by vegetable vitality, but\r\nwe will not attempt to explain the manner or whence the material is\r\nprimarily derived. Cosmic dust or the invisible atoms of the atmosphere\r\nmay be the source. The origin of the gold nuggets and the particles of\r\ngold-dust in the well-defined placers, as advanced in the hypotheses of\r\nRaymond and Murray within the past few years, is connected very closely\r\nwith the theory of the recent formation of diamonds in similar placers.\r\n\r\nIn connection with this theme, it is proper to make a digression in\r\nexplanation of the condition and formation of the gold placers, as they\r\nseem to be highly suggestive of the depositions of the diamond placers.\r\nGold is often found in the same strata with the diamonds, and the\r\npresence of the one sometimes indicates the deposition of the other.\r\nBut this is not invariably the fact. Yet the peculiar formation in\r\nwhich the metal and the gem occur leads the geologist to similar trains\r\nof reasoning when seeking to explain their presence in the tertiary\r\nstrata of very recent times. It has been generally supposed that all\r\nalluvial gold is the result of disintegration of the old crystalline\r\nrocks. But we now distinguish placer gold into two kinds, as the\r\nalluvial and that which results from decomposition of quartz reefs.\r\nThe distinction between these two qualities of the same metal arises\r\nfrom differences which are quite strongly marked. The alluvial gold is\r\ngenerally much purer than the reef gold; and the reefs rarely, if ever,\r\ncontain nuggets. The appearance of the nuggets and particles from the\r\ntrue placers, in comparison with the gold-dust evidently set free by\r\naqueous action, is suggestive of a theory that they have been deposited\r\nby different agencies.\r\n\r\nIt has been suggested by Mr. Selwyn, the Government Geologist of\r\nVictoria, while studying these differences, that the gold nuggets found\r\nin the drift may have been deposited from solutions containing gold by\r\nmeans of electric and chemical agencies. Mr. Skey, analyst to the New\r\nZealand Geological Survey, has recently come to similar conclusions\r\nfrom his researches on the subject. The theory is well illustrated by\r\nthe formation of crystals and masses of iron pyrites from solutions of\r\nthat metal; and as gold is often found associated, free and uncombined,\r\nin these pyritiferous depositions, there is sufficient evidence to\r\nbelieve there may be some connection in the manner of formation.\r\n\r\nFrom the results of certain chemical experiments in the laboratory,\r\nit would appear that organic matter is one of the necessary chemical\r\nagents for the decomposition of some of the solutions of gold.\r\nTherefore, if we assume this hypothesis to have a positive bearing\r\nupon this question, the abundance of organic matter occurring in the\r\ngravel beds adds to its weight as an argument. Selwyn found in the\r\ngold-bearing drifts of Australia quantities of fragments of wood,\r\nroots of trees, and other organic _débris_ to serve as nuclei, or as\r\nreagents for the reduction of mineral solutions. We may introduce as\r\nevidence the formation of iron pyrites in crystalline forms, which is\r\ntaking place at the present day under the action of sea-water. The\r\nmetal in these instances replaces the organic structure of wood, or\r\nassumes definite forms with a particle of organic matter as a nucleus.\r\n\r\nThe formation of gold nuggets from solutions of the metal is by no\r\nmeans as wonderful or difficult of explanation as some other phenomena\r\nwitnessed in metallurgy. The strange play of pseudomorphism is well\r\ndefined in some instances, if not well understood. Here we observe\r\nthat the peculiarity of form may be rigidly adhered to, while the\r\ncomposition is completely changed. In the waters of certain copper\r\nmines, drills, rings, and bars of iron that have accidentally been left\r\nhave in course of time become transformed into pure copper. The iron\r\nof the implements has changed places with the atoms of copper held in\r\nsolution.\r\n\r\nIn connection with this interesting theory, there are some puzzling\r\nfacts to be deduced from the phenomena of the auriferous sand beds\r\nof some of the rivers of Europe. The gold placers along the coast\r\nof the Danube and the Rhine are situated far from the mountains,\r\nthe supposed sources of the metal, and there are also wide barren\r\ndistricts intervening. The river Tesino affords no gold in its sands\r\nuntil its waters have passed through and beyond Lake Maggiore. From\r\nthese and other examples, it is quite evident that the gold which\r\nappears in these river beds has been derived from the placers through\r\nwhich the rivers have passed, and not from quartz reefs in the distant\r\nmountainous regions. The situation of these placers, with the evenness\r\nand regularity of their deposits, also the absence of auriferous ledges\r\namong the contiguous rocks, permit the observer to indulge in the idea\r\nthat the gold may have been deposited from solutions and not from\r\nthe decomposition of crystalline rocks. We certainly have sufficient\r\nevidence to object to that final explanation which ascribes all these\r\ndepositions to aqueous action in distant times, and to the abrasion\r\nof primitive mountains, the evidence of whose existence is alone and\r\ndoubtfully afforded by the _débris_ which form the strata of the gold\r\nand diamond placers. The ancients long ago noticed the deposition of\r\ngold in the beds of rivers; hence the phrase “The gold-breeding sands\r\nof Pactolus.”\r\n\r\nIt has been a favorite theory with many persons of a philosophic turn\r\nof mind that all organic forms were created upon the earth not by\r\nmere chance or hap-hazard, nor by what have been called by the early\r\ngeologists “freaks of nature,” but, on the contrary, with some definite\r\nintent on the part of the Creator, and perhaps for the welfare of\r\nmankind. Some of these far-sighted thinkers have advanced their views\r\nso far as to maintain that even obscure animal and vegetable forms\r\nmay have some indirect or distant effect upon the well-being of man.\r\nWe all must admit that it is indeed a beautiful hypothesis, even if\r\nit be contested by stern and savage arguments. But if we indulge in\r\nthis manner of reasoning, there seems to be hardly a limit in natural\r\nphilosophy in which we may not seek for evidence.\r\n\r\nCan we not include the subject of our treatise among those things\r\nwhich are supposed to have some influence upon the moulding of human\r\ncharacter? Certainly its geological age, its origin, the beauties and\r\nwonders of its physical properties, and their application to art and\r\nscience as well as to the wants of society, furnish evidence to sustain\r\nan inference.\r\n\r\nBut how can a cold, inanimate object like a gem influence the condition\r\nor expansion of the human intellect? the rigid materialist may say. The\r\ngems, he will maintain, apply only to the superficial wants of man, and\r\ndirectly tend to degrade rather than elevate our natural morals; that\r\nthey are articles of commerce, and that commerce debases our natural\r\ninstincts.\r\n\r\nOn the contrary, we may say that the beautiful in nature of whatever\r\ndegree is calculated to assist in the development of mental culture;\r\nand without these beautiful lessons and examples constantly spread\r\nout before us, man would always have remained in a state of utter\r\nbarbarism. As we look back upon the history of life, how many of the\r\ntriumphs of human architecture may be traced to the suggestions arising\r\nfrom the observance of the varied forms of nature! Nearly all of the\r\nbeauties of the Gothic or Grecian styles may be found existing in the\r\nfossil relics of by-gone ages or even in the multiple forms of existing\r\nvegetation. What grand deductions Newton derived from his studies of\r\nthe glories of the opal and the iridescent gleams of the soap-bubble!\r\n\r\nLet us follow our theme a little longer. In reviewing the fragmentary\r\nremains of the early periods of the earth’s history, the observer\r\nwill admit that there has been a marked progress in even vegetable\r\nlife as well as in the animal. For in the primitive ages we find the\r\nnon-flowering plants were more numerous than the flowering species.\r\nTherefore, in contemplating the precedence of succession of animal\r\nand vegetable life, the thought naturally occurs to us that perhaps\r\nthe most delicate and beautiful of all our flowers elate from recent\r\ngeological periods.\r\n\r\nWe may also apply this hypothesis to the gems, and perhaps maintain\r\nthat they too have arrived at perfection by progressive stages. The\r\ncorundum, for instance, in the primitive rocks is never so pure and\r\nperfect as the nodules and crystals found in the true gem strata of\r\nrecent formations. The emerald of the limestone is also incomparably\r\nabove the beryls of the granites. The spinels, the chrysoberyls, the\r\nzircons, and the topazes of the gem beds are generally far superior\r\nto those found in the old crystalline rocks. There are, however, some\r\nplain exceptions to this plausible theory; and the finest of the\r\ntourmalines are found in cavities in granite ledges that appear to be\r\nof an early age.\r\n\r\nWe are also sometimes inclined to think that color in the early ages\r\nof terrestrial life was wanting in the rich hues which now deck\r\nanimate nature. For of all the relics of the old geologic forms that\r\nare preserved to us their colors are either greatly faded or were at\r\nfirst faintly painted. Even in the tertiary division the hues are\r\nnot beautiful. The shells, however, exhibit a trace of the pearly\r\nhue of the nacre, which may once have shone as brightly as in the\r\nmodern mollusca. Some of the fossil fishes display a gleam of the\r\nsilver tints that now glisten on the sides of the living species.\r\nFossil corals preserved in the marble, however, have retained the\r\nbeauty of form but lost all delicacy of hue, if they ever possessed\r\nany. Still, absence of bright and glowing colors of the animals in\r\na fossil state is by no means conclusive evidence that nature was\r\nthen devoid of external decoration. For we may see on every side\r\nhow the beautiful hues of animal and vegetable life may fade and\r\ndisappear altogether on the suspension of vital activity; and also\r\nhow the process of solidification and petrifaction may modify or even\r\nobliterate all traces of organic color. It is, however, a fact that the\r\nrichest-colored gems and minerals are found near the surface of the\r\nearth, as though they required the direct influence of the solar rays,\r\nlike the finest varieties of colored coral and the gorgeous flowers of\r\nvegetation.\r\n\r\nIn reflecting upon these phenomena, and in seeking for the causes that\r\nled to the creation of the diamond, and sifting down the evidence\r\nthat science has patiently brought to light, we are naturally led to\r\nphilosophic musings. It is a singular reflection that much of our\r\ncommercial greatness is derived from luxuriant vegetations of early\r\nages of the earth’s history. How much pleasure, how many of the\r\ncomforts of civilization and even the necessities of life, do we owe\r\nto the extinct fauna of by-gone ages! Even invalid man, seeking to\r\nrestore the exhausted fountains of his shattered nature in the waters\r\nof some of the sulphur springs, quaffs the life-restoring principles\r\nfrom the mineral and animal _débris_ of the lower ocean of the old\r\nred sandstone. Here, then, is a happy adaptation of the vague and\r\nempty theory of transmigration of the ancients,--the metempsychosis of\r\nEmpedocles. Certain elements imprisoned in the earth for ages return\r\nagain at last to reanimate exhausted man and improve his social life.\r\nThe same agency in recent times, and by natural though mysterious laws,\r\nhas produced from similar materials the gem, which seems to be quite as\r\nnecessary for the superficial wants of mankind as gold or silver.\r\n\r\nIn studying the earth’s history and examining the successive phases\r\nof its development, we are insensibly led to the idea that all these\r\nstages, seemingly progressive, never retrograde, were for a definite\r\npurpose, if not for the exclusive benefit of mankind. For it is only\r\njust before the introduction of man that some of the highest orders\r\nof vegetation, such as the _Rosaceæ_, appear on the earth. There is\r\ncertainly a marked intent in the appearance of the pear, the apple,\r\nplum, cherry, peach, and other fruits, with the true grasses, late in\r\nthe tertiary period.\r\n\r\nWe may also trace this suggestive progression in the development\r\nof even insect life. In the Silurian age the hum of the insect was\r\nunheard; and it was not until the oölitic period that this form of\r\nanimal life appeared. A fossil gem--the amber--reveals the time of the\r\nbirth of the insect dearest to man; and it was not until the eocene\r\nchange that the earth heard for the first time\r\n\r\n  “The soft murmur of the vagrant bee.”\r\n\r\nMay we not also place in the same category of possible intents the late\r\ndeposition of the diamond? It is not so very strange, after all, when\r\nwe come to consider the vast field that lies within the range of the\r\nargument.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER V.\r\n\r\n                       PHYSICAL PROPERTIES, ETC.\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore explaining, or rather attempting to explain, the phenomena\r\nof some of the prominent physical properties of the mineral, it is\r\nproper that we should give a description of its forms and its natural\r\nappearance as it is taken from the mines, so that our reader may become\r\nmore familiar with the subject. We will not, however, venture very far\r\namong the dry details of crystallography, even if it be a subject of\r\ngreat interest to the student in science. The stone which so readily\r\nattracts the eye by its dazzling splendors after it has received a\r\ndefinite form and polish from art, is seldom attractive to the view\r\nunless it occurs in a rare and perfect form of crystallization. Even\r\nthen, in this primitive state it exhibits none of the rainbow play\r\nof color which makes the stone so celebrated and so beautiful. In\r\nreality, in these rare conditions it is seldom if ever so lustrous and\r\npleasing to the sight as crystals of many other minerals. In general,\r\nthe diamond is so obscure in its attractions that practised eyes are\r\nrequired for its search.\r\n\r\nRecently the distinguished savant Von Tschudi, in visiting some of\r\nthe diamond mines of Brazil, was unable to distinguish readily the\r\ngems as they lay in the washed cascalho, while the trained eyes of the\r\nnegro miners picked them out with ease. It has been stated that the\r\ndiamonds are always or nearly always covered with an earthy crust of\r\nvarious hues, especially greenish or yellowish, which is hardly the\r\nfact; for what appears to be a crust is often caused by the salient\r\nedges of the laminæ, among which a little earthy or coloring matter\r\nhas been introduced. These extraneous colors generally disappear when\r\nthe surface of the stone is removed; and, in fact, the degree of their\r\nintensity is very much modified when the rough gem is placed in alcohol\r\nor in any fluid of high refraction.\r\n\r\nThe dull, whitish appearance seen in the natural diamonds is also\r\nproduced by the action of fire, which raises the edges of the laminæ,\r\nproducing a faint milky aspect.\r\n\r\nThe primitive form of the mineral is the octahedron, and many irregular\r\nmasses may be reduced by cleavage to that of a double pyramid.\r\nThese octahedral crystals are sometimes as perfect in outline as a\r\nmathematical model, with clean-cut angles and smooth faces. In some\r\nspecimens the edges may be truncated, that is, as if they had been\r\nflattened or ground off by mechanical means. Generally, however, the\r\ncrystals are of the form of the octahedrons with rounded faces. The\r\ndodecahedrons, with their twelve faces, and the cubes, with their\r\nfour sides, may also be reduced by cleavage to the primitive form of\r\nthe double pyramid. Sometimes two crystals are united, forming what\r\nare called hemitrope or twin crystals. Then, again, a number may be\r\ngrouped together, assuming on the whole a globular-like mass. But they\r\nare decidedly different from the globular, which in their form of\r\ncrystallization radiate from the centre of the crystal.\r\n\r\nThe variety of diamond called boart, or bort, deriving its name from\r\nthe supposed abortive attempt of nature to form a perfect crystal,\r\nis also quite deficient in cleavage, or its laminæ are so irregular\r\nas to render splitting quite impossible and the cutting of the stone\r\nequally so. The transparency of these forms is also affected by the\r\narrangement of crystallization; hence they are generally crushed into\r\npowder for polishing material or used for various purposes in the\r\narts. The specific gravity of these varieties seems to be influenced\r\nby the manner of crystallization. For instances, we find that the fine\r\ntransparent crystals have a specific gravity of 3.55 (water being\r\nconsidered the standard as 1), while the bort is somewhat less; and the\r\nmassive variety called the carbonado varies from 3 to 3.4, according to\r\nthe amount of earthy matter it may contain. It has also been asserted\r\nthat the blue, the green, the orange, and the red varieties are heavier\r\nthan the white. The phenomena of electricity observed in the diamond\r\nare not remarkable, and are inferior to most of the gems. Some of the\r\nprecious stones when excited retain their electrical properties for\r\nhours or even days, but the diamond loses it almost immediately. It\r\nexhibits vitreous electricity when rubbed.\r\n\r\nMuch has been said and written concerning the artificial\r\nphosphorescence exhibited by the diamond when removed to a dark room\r\nafter having been exposed for a short time to the sun’s rays. We are\r\nnot able to verify this statement, and feel inclined to doubt its\r\ncorrectness, although we have been assured by experimenters of the fact.\r\n\r\nOne of the most remarkable properties of the diamond is its extreme\r\nhardness, in which it far exceeds all known substances in the mineral\r\nkingdom. This peculiarity is due to the substance itself, but appears\r\nto be modified by its color and its form of crystallization like some\r\nother minerals.\r\n\r\nThe more perfectly the crystal is formed, the easier its laminæ become\r\ndetached, and the softer the substance appears to be. In the globular\r\nforms, which are quite deficient in cleavage planes, the hardness\r\nis excessive, and often resists the most determined efforts of the\r\nlapidary. Even in fine crystals we shall find that certain angles are\r\nharder than others; and we may observe the same relative degree among\r\ncrystals of other minerals, like those of the topaz. In the large\r\ntransparent diamonds of irregular form, spots of excessive hardness are\r\noften found. These are called by the lapidaries “knots,” and appear to\r\nbe due to a change in the process of crystallization. The coloring\r\nmatter, or the mode of its formation, seems to affect the degree of\r\nhardness in many minerals; and in respect to the diamond, the rare\r\ncrystallized black form is harder than the limpid or lighter colored.\r\n\r\nSome years ago a black diamond from Borneo was placed in the hand\r\nof Gallais the lapidary, to be experimented upon at the expense of\r\nthe French Institute. The chief object of the test was to ascertain\r\nthe relative degree of hardness in comparison with some of the other\r\nvarieties of diamond. In this trial the lapidary wore out his steel\r\nwheel and a large quantity of ordinary diamond dust without making\r\nthe least impression on the surface of the black diamond. Although\r\nheavily loaded with weights, it lost none of its roughness, and was\r\nheated almost to whiteness by the friction of the wheel, which revolved\r\nwith great velocity. During the period of this extreme velocity it is\r\nreported that a shower of sparks was emitted; but how shall we account\r\nfor this scintillation, when the ordinary transparent diamond does not\r\ngive forth sparks when struck by steel?\r\n\r\nThe carbonado, which is amorphous and without cleavage, is also\r\nextremely hard. The term “adamas,” which the ancients bestowed upon it\r\nas denoting an invincible infrangibility, is not quite appropriate; for\r\nalthough it is far superior in hardness to all other known substances,\r\nit is in reality very fragile. And in the power to resist the effect\r\nof shock it is also inferior to some of the other gems, and especially\r\nthe sapphire. Therefore several mineralogists have thought that the\r\nancients really applied the term to steel or to some of the varieties\r\nof corundum, like the ruby and the sapphire, and not the diamond.\r\nIt is curious that this property should be ascribed erroneously to\r\nthe diamond for so many ages, when a trifling experiment would have\r\ndisclosed the real condition of things. In the days of the poet\r\nLucretius the gem was believed to be able to resist violent blows.\r\n\r\n                      ----“adamantina saxa\r\n  Prima acie constant, ictus contemnere sueta.”\r\n\r\nPliny entertained the same idea, and also that its infrangibility\r\ncould be overcome only by first steeping it in goats’ blood. Even in\r\nmediæval times Ben Mansur, the Persian mineralogist, gravely states\r\nthat a diamond laid upon the anvil and struck by a hammer would not\r\nbe broken, but would be driven by the violence of the blow into the\r\nsubstance of the anvil. This stupid but wide-spread idea has prevailed\r\neven in modern times; and many a gem has been sacrificed by the\r\nignorant in testing the character of the stone. The brittleness of the\r\ngem is partly due to its singular cleavage, which in regular crystals\r\nis so perfect and uniform as to permit the lapidary to remove the\r\nlaminæ so as to entirely demolish the structure of the crystal. But\r\nwhen once accomplished, no artisan, however skilful, can replace them\r\nagain. The facility with which the stone may be separated was known in\r\nancient times among the Hindoos, and probably in Europe as early as the\r\nsixteenth century, as De Boot knew of a physician who could divide the\r\ndiamond into thin scales like a piece of talc; but it was forgotten\r\nuntil Wollaston not many years ago stumbled upon the secret of cleavage\r\nand made it known to modern science.\r\n\r\nThe real charm and value of the diamond lie in its remarkable\r\nbrilliancy, and in the wonderful prismatic display of the bright and\r\nbeautiful colors, which are constantly fugitive, but perpetually\r\nreturning, as the learned Abbé Haüy elegantly expresses it. When a\r\nray of light is reflected from the surface of a body, a particular\r\nimpression is conveyed to the eye, which we may properly term the\r\neclat. This impression is often so decided and so varied in its\r\neffects, that we are able to distinguish certain substances at a\r\nglance; and the reflection from the diamond exhibits a peculiarity\r\nwhich is seen only in a very few substances. This is known as the\r\nadamantine flash, and none of the gems display it to any marked degree\r\nexcept the rare zircon. We witness the perfection of this property in\r\nthe black and opaque but crystallized diamond, when faceted by art; and\r\nalso in some few minerals of which we shall soon make mention. When\r\nthe rays of light are refracted, after passing through the transparent\r\ndiamond after it has been cut in a certain manner, and its facets\r\nare arranged in an exact relation to each other, then we obtain\r\nthe remarkable exhibition of color which is known as the prismatic\r\ndisplay. This singular property is seen in perfection, or even to any\r\nconsiderable degree, only in the diamond, among all the gems thus\r\nfar known. But art, however, has succeeded in imitating it in one\r\nof her productions of glass, and so admirably, that under favorable\r\ncircumstances it is quite impossible for the eye alone to distinguish\r\nthe artificial from the real gem. Some of the theories relating to the\r\ncauses of these phenomena we will discuss hereafter, and at the present\r\nwill only say that it is to modern science the diamond owes the full\r\ndevelopment of its latent beauty; and that the result was not attained\r\nuntil Newton demonstrated the laws that govern the refraction of light.\r\nIt is only in the brilliant and rose-cut forms, or their modifications,\r\nwhen made with mathematical precision, that the brilliancy and beauty\r\nof the stone is displayed in perfection. The ancients, therefore, were\r\nnot acquainted with the full splendors of the gem. For, being ignorant\r\nof the laws of refraction of light, they polished the stone chiefly\r\nwith the view of preserving its greatest weight; and, at the same time,\r\nproducing perfect transparency. Hence most of the specimens of ancient\r\nand barbaric art are rudely cut, and therefore do not exhibit the\r\ndegree of beauty which is latent in the mineral. This is also one of\r\nthe reasons why the luxurious Romans preferred the opal to the diamond,\r\nsince the polished, or even the rude specimens of opal exhibited their\r\nglorious reflections of wondrous hues, both by day and in artificial\r\nlight by night; while the diamond, with its natural or polished faces,\r\ngave forth no prismatic display in the daylight, and but a slight\r\ndegree comparatively in artificial light at night.\r\n\r\nWhence arises this remarkable brilliancy, and to what particular cause\r\nis the property due? This inquiry has afforded a fruitful theme of\r\nspeculation among philosophers, but at the present time we are content\r\nto say that the refractive power of the gem is due to the nature of its\r\nsubstance. This is somewhat indefinite, it is true, but what else can\r\nwe say?\r\n\r\nUnder the general belief that the harder the gem the higher its\r\nrefractive powers would be, it has been maintained that the brilliancy\r\nof the diamond arose from the simple property of its excessive\r\nhardness. Investigation, however, does not sustain this widespread\r\nview. Hardness, indeed, may have considerable relation with the\r\narrangement and form of the molecules composing the gem, for in the\r\nsame crystal it is not uniform,--some faces and angles being harder\r\nthan others,--but it does not determine the degree of brilliancy. To\r\nstrengthen this statement we will take for instances the soft minerals,\r\ncrocroisite, the chromate of lead; the Greenockite, the sulphuret of\r\ncadmium; and the octahedrite, the oxide of titanium, which exceed even\r\nthe diamond in brilliancy. There are also other decided examples among\r\nthe transparent minerals to sustain this view; the most remarkable\r\nof which perhaps may be found in the zircon, a gem which is soft\r\nas quartz; yet it ranks next to the diamond in brightness, and far\r\nsurpasses in eclat every other gem, even the sapphire, which is next\r\nto the diamond in hardness. Density does not seem to have anything to\r\ndo with the determination of the refractive power of gems, for the\r\ngarnet, spinel, sapphire, and zircon are much heavier than the diamond,\r\nand are yet far inferior in brilliancy. The topaz is exactly of the\r\nsame specific gravity as the diamond (3.55), but nevertheless its\r\nrefractive powers have but little more than one half the energy of the\r\ndiamond. The relative brilliancy of the diamond to that of the purest\r\nlimpid quartz is 8 to 3; but the relative density is only as 4 to 3.\r\nAll diamonds do not exhibit the same degree of brilliancy, because\r\nthey do not possess alike the same quality of purity or perfection of\r\ncrystallization.\r\n\r\nWe often observe among the minerals that the most perfect specimens\r\nare found of a diminutive size; and we shall also find that the finest\r\nand purest types of the diamond occur in stones of little weight. The\r\nlarger crystals, or amorphous masses, seem to be wanting in purity\r\nand brightness as compared with the lesser; and this peculiarity may\r\nbe observed well marked in some of the other gems. Here, then, we may\r\nfind material for the argument that the degree of brilliancy is in a\r\nmeasure due to the perfection of the crystallization of the stone;\r\nand, therefore, the larger and coarser the laminæ of the crystal the\r\nless will be its brightness. One thing, however, is certain; that the\r\nmost brilliant gems are obtained from stones of no great weight, and\r\nwhich also seem, from their form, to indicate a nodular arrangement of\r\nparticles in their formation; or, in other words, a certain concentric\r\nmanner of crystallization. This form of deposition is not peculiar\r\nto the diamond, but is clearly shown in the sapphires, topazes,\r\nchrysoberyls, tourmalines; and the finest specimens of these gems are\r\ncut from these nodular forms. We think we are correct in stating that\r\nthe greatest brilliancy and the most beautiful prismatic display may\r\nbe observed in diamonds of less than ten karats in weight. In fact,\r\nthe diminution of brilliancy in the gem, when above twenty karats,\r\nis easily discerned by the eye alone, as compared with the vivid and\r\nadamantine flash of a pure and perfect four or eight karat stone. The\r\nsame peculiarity may be observed in the little globular masses of the\r\nchrysoberyl, which are seldom larger than a pea in size, but which,\r\nwhen cut, exhibit flashes of fire which are only equalled or excelled\r\nby the diamond, or the rarer zircon. We can hardly realize that the\r\nlittle rounded pebbles of white topaz, known as _gouttes d’eau_, “drops\r\nof water,” will yield gems of such lustre as to be often exhibited,\r\nand even sold for the diamond. Yet the larger irregular masses, or\r\nfinely crystallized specimens of the same mineral, do not afford gems\r\nof unusual brilliancy. In these instances we may affirm that the form\r\nor mode of crystallization has something to do with the degree of\r\nbrilliancy.\r\n\r\nThe prismatic play of color which this gem alone possesses to any\r\nconsiderable degree constitutes its chief charm, and its cause has\r\nbeen a matter of earnest study among opticians. A plausible theory has\r\nlately been advanced by an English philosopher that the colored rays\r\nare produced by the relation of the high refractive to its very low\r\ndispersive power. For instance, this refractive power in the diamond,\r\nor, in other words, its property of bending a ray of light falling\r\nobliquely upon its surface, is 2.439, while that of water is only\r\n1.336, and that of glass 1.500. But its power of dispersing a ray of\r\nwhite light, or, in other words, of separating it into its compound\r\ncolors in reference to its refractive power, is only 0.038, while\r\nthat of glass is 0.052. Hence it is surmised that this inferiority\r\nof dispersive power is required for the production of the splendid\r\ncolored reflections which constitute the glory of the gem. It is also\r\nmaintained that this high refractive power separates the red and the\r\nblue rays more than a high dispersive power would in other transparent\r\nbodies, and to such degree as to allow each color of the spectrum its\r\nfull force. As example, the zircon, with its inferior reflections, is\r\noffered, its refraction being 1.99 on the established scale, while its\r\ndispersive power is as high as 0.044. The relations of the spinel are\r\nalso as 1.81 to 0.040, and neither does the gem display the rainbow\r\nhues. This theory is certainly ingenious, and if correct the test\r\nmay be applied to other transparent minerals possessing similar\r\nrelations. We may, therefore, expect the white garnet to exhibit the\r\nproperty of prismatic display, as it has a refractive power of 1.81 and\r\na dispersive power of 0.033. But, unfortunately, perfectly pure and\r\ntransparent white garnets are unknown, and we must therefore turn to\r\nother minerals for comparison.\r\n\r\nTo the white tourmaline, then, we will apply the test, since this\r\nmineral has a refractive power of 1.66, with a dispersive power of\r\nonly 0.028. Here, then, we have nearly the same relation as observed\r\nin the diamond; and, if the theory be correct, we may reasonably\r\nexpect the exhibition of the same phenomena. But, upon examination of\r\nseveral perfectly white and transparent tourmalines from Mt. Mica,\r\ncut into regular brilliants, we have failed to detect an increase of\r\nprismatic display, or even discover any evidence to lend support to\r\nthe plausibility of the hypothesis. We, therefore, reluctantly turn to\r\nother arguments for a solution of this most interesting problem.\r\n\r\nThe snow-white diamond displays the rainbow hues in the greatest\r\nperfection; and this is the reason why this quality is sought for in\r\npreference to the light buff or deeper yellow, which are in reality\r\nmore brilliant. The deeper the hue of the gem, the less becomes the\r\nprismatic display; and when the diamond becomes of deep and decided\r\nhue, the colored reflections cease altogether. It is somewhat\r\nsingular that the colored gems are generally more brilliant than the\r\npure white, that is, if the color is not so deep as to affect the\r\ntransparency of the stone. For examples, we shall find that the white\r\nsapphire has an index of refraction equal to 1.768, while the blue has\r\n1.794, and the red 1.779. The refractive of the white topaz is 1.610,\r\nwhile the yellow is 1.632.\r\n\r\nThe brilliancy and rainbow play of the diamond is not so apparent by\r\ndaylight as by certain kinds of artificial light, when all its latent\r\nbeauties are called forth as if by magic. The light of the camp-fire in\r\nthe obscurity of night produces a marvellous effect upon the polished\r\nstone; and it is no wonder that the savage heart of the Russian\r\nGeneral, Suvaroff, was fascinated by the vivid gleams of his treasured\r\ndiamonds when viewed at night in the flickering beams of his bivouac\r\nfire. It may seem singular that the brilliant white light of gas does\r\nnot display the qualities of the diamond as the duller flame of the wax\r\ncandle. The secret lies, perhaps, in the difference in their spectra.\r\nNevertheless, there is a great difference in their effects upon the\r\ngem, and it is a fact that the wax candle far exceeds the gaslight in\r\ncalling forth the latent splendors of the gem. Therefore, we can assert\r\nthat the brilliancy of toilets where the diamond is much worn depends\r\ngreatly upon the manner of illuminating the apartment.\r\n\r\nWe now come to another interesting problem in the study of the nature\r\nof the diamond. We refer to the various colors of the gem. As we have\r\nmaintained that the mineral is of vegetable origin we may be expected\r\nto explain the phenomena of its color upon this hypothesis, and also\r\naccount for the various changes of the gem when exposed to the effects\r\nof heat or the fire test. But we must admit with candor that our views\r\nconcerning this physical property are decidedly unsatisfactory, and\r\nshall refer the reader to one of the chapters in our treatise on the\r\nTourmaline, in which are grouped some of the theories relating to the\r\nsubject. In fact, we may repeat the remarks of Huyghens, who said at\r\nthe end of the seventeenth century: “In spite of the labors of Newton,\r\nno one has yet fully discovered the cause of the color of bodies.”\r\n“We must, then,” says M. Babinet, “admire, without penetrating their\r\nsecret, the unparalleled red of the Oriental ruby, the pure yellow of\r\nthe topaz, the unmingled greenness of the emerald, the soft blue of the\r\nsapphire, and the rich violet of the amethyst. This is not the only\r\nthing the discovery of which we shall leave to posterity.”\r\n\r\nThe color-suite of the mineral is much more extensive and varied than\r\nhas been generally admitted by mineralogists. We are led to infer from\r\ntheir works that white is the prevailing hue of the gem; but Beudant\r\ndeclares that perfect limpidity and whiteness is rare comparatively,\r\nand that the stone is generally affected with yellowish or brownish\r\ntints. But what becomes of the vast numbers of these clouded or tinged\r\nand inferior gems, if the mines yield so many of them in comparison\r\nwith the snow-white? Are they consumed in polishing others, or\r\nexpended in the arts, or have the lapidaries secret processes by which\r\nthese objectionable tints are expunged from the stone?\r\n\r\nBarbot, the French jeweller, declares that, by means of certain\r\nparticular and energetic agents, aided by a proper degree of heat, he\r\nis able to remove the greens of all shades, the light-red, and the\r\nyellow, when the coloring matter is superficial, or even situated\r\nbetween the external laminæ. We are inclined to believe Barbot in this\r\nparticular reference, especially as he admits that he is unable to\r\nchange much the deep-yellow, the brown, and the smoky-tinted stones.\r\nOf the yellow tints, the diamond affords the most beautiful examples,\r\nand far surpasses in variety all the other gems, with the exception\r\nperhaps of quartz. To the yellow topaz it is decidedly superior in its\r\nrange of shades, and in some of its chrome-like tints it is without\r\nan equal among the gems. This hue of chrome mixed with a faint tinge\r\nof green is a delicate, yet gorgeous, shade, and is not often seen.\r\nStones of a canary-yellow are quite common, and perfect resemblances to\r\nthe Brazilian topaz are not rare. From these hues they pass insensibly\r\ninto brown and black. The transparent light-brown stones are often\r\nmodified in hue when exposed to the action of heat, and some of them\r\nexhibit remarkable changes of color. M. Halpen, in 1866, exhibited to\r\nthe French Academy of Sciences a singular diamond of this description.\r\nIt was a stone of sixty grains weight, and of a whitish hue tinged\r\nslightly with brown. But when it was exposed to the action of heat it\r\nchanged its tint to a fine rose-color, and retained it for six or eight\r\ndays, when it gradually returned to its natural hue. This remarkable\r\neffect was not an accidental result, but was tried five times at the\r\nAcademy with success and without injury to the stone. In other colored\r\ndiamonds the action of fire often produces permanent effects, and\r\nsometimes a brownish hue is converted into a decided red color. Buckman\r\nsaw a diamond with a large brown spot in its interior change to a\r\nbeautiful red, like that of the Balais ruby, after the stone had been\r\nplaced in borax and exposed to a red heat. Another stone, however, of\r\nsimilar appearance, likewise exposed, changed to a permanent black,\r\nto the great injury of the gem and dismay of the experimenter. The\r\nred varieties of this mineral are rarely of deep tints, but when they\r\nexhibit a decided red color they form the most gorgeous of gems. The\r\nlargest and finest of this description known is the ten-karat stone\r\npurchased by the Emperor Paul of Russia for one hundred thousand\r\nroubles. This gem may be considered the marvel of the mineral kingdom.\r\nThe princely collection of the late Mr. Hope possessed one of a\r\nblood-red garnet shade, also a fine twelve and a half karat stone of an\r\napricot hue, besides several others of a beautiful hyacinth red, or of\r\na lilac pink.\r\n\r\nThe celebrated cabinet of gems belonging to the late Marquis de Drée\r\ncontained a large and beautiful rose-colored diamond. Prince Riccia,\r\nof Naples, acquired in 1830 a very fine rose-colored brilliant of\r\nfifteen karats weight. M. Halpen, in 1838, exhibited a magnificent\r\ngem of this description of twenty-two and a half karats. Among the\r\ncrown jewels of France there are several splendid brilliants of a\r\npeach-blossom hue, and there are also quite a number to be seen among\r\nthe princely caskets of Europe. It is, however, somewhat remarkable\r\nthat this gem, although possessing several shades of red, never, or\r\nvery rarely, occurs of a decided violet or purple color. Diamonds of a\r\nlight aqua-marine of greenish and bluish tints are not rare, but those\r\nof a positive grass-green color are uncommon. Perfect stones of decided\r\ngreen form the most magnificent gems of this color. The velvety green\r\nflashed forth by the extraordinary power of the stone surpasses beyond\r\ncomparison the finest emeralds with their duller reflections. In fact,\r\nwe may term the splendid green diamond of forty karats, now in the\r\nGreen Vaults at Dresden, as being one of the five paragons among all\r\nthe gems of the world.\r\n\r\nIn the Museum of Natural History in Paris there are some small diamonds\r\nof very fine shades of green, which were collected by the celebrated\r\nWerner. Some of the diamonds which have a slight milky hue, when cut\r\nso as to allow the play of light within the stone, present a very\r\nbeautiful appearance. The varied flashes of colored rays, in contrast\r\nwith the duller hues of the stone, appear like the charming effects of\r\nthe finest specimens of Siberian adularia, and are therefore entitled\r\nto the name of aventurine diamonds.\r\n\r\nThe asterism, or star-like form of six rays, which is so beautifully\r\ndisplayed by the sapphire when it assumes a certain form of internal\r\narrangement of crystallization, is sometimes, though very rarely,\r\nwitnessed in the diamond. There is one of this description to be seen\r\nin the Museum of the _Jardin des Plantes_ in Paris.\r\n\r\nThe diamond is rarely found of a perfect shade of blue; but there are\r\nnow in Europe several magnificent gems of this description. Foremost of\r\nall of them stood the famous blue diamond of 67²⁄₁₆ karats, belonging\r\nto the French crown. This marvel of Nature’s work, with two other\r\ndiamonds of paler hue and lesser weight,--thirty-one and ten karats\r\nrespectively,--disappeared on that fatal night of September, 1792,\r\nand have never since been discovered. At the present day, the finest\r\nknown is that which belongs to the princely collection of the late Mr.\r\nHope, and weighs 44¹⁄₄ karats. It is of a fine blue; but exhibits that\r\nsteel-like tint which is so often seen in sapphires. The next in value\r\nand beauty is that which is preserved at Munich. It is a magnificent\r\ngem of thirty-six karats weight, and of superb color.\r\n\r\nThe crystallized black diamond is a very rare stone; and, when\r\npolished, it forms a unique gem, since it exhibits a remarkable\r\nbrilliancy, proceeding, as it were, from darkness itself. We do not now\r\nrefer to the compact variety, known as carbon or carbonado, which is\r\nnever found except in the amorphous form, but the crystalline variety,\r\nwhich is of greater density and more homogeneous. The famous collector,\r\nDogni, possessed a very fine specimen of this kind which had been cut\r\nwith small facets, and exhibited a vivid eclat. It afterwards came into\r\nthe possession of Mr. Bapst, who disposed of it to Louis XVIII. for\r\nthe sum of twenty-four thousand francs. A large and unique diamond,\r\nalmost black, formerly belonged to the late Duke of York. Several of\r\nthe European mineralogical cabinets have interesting and valuable\r\ncollections of colored diamonds; but the finest is to be seen in the\r\nImperial Cabinet of Minerals at Vienna. This beautiful and complete\r\nseries, which illustrates the great range of the color-suite of the\r\ngem, was the life-long labor of a Tyrolese gentleman, by the name of\r\nHelmreicher. This enthusiastic amateur went to Brazil, and passed most\r\nof his life in the mines, searching for the gems.\r\n\r\nWe will not fatigue our readers with long quotations of authors and\r\nphilosophers concerning the spiritual properties of this gem; but we\r\nwill briefly say, that a well-selected compilation of all these views\r\nand speculations, extending back to very early times, would form a\r\nchapter by itself, and quite as interesting as absurd. Even the good\r\nsense of the Latin philosopher Pliny was affected so far as to indulge\r\nin the belief that the gem was not only an antidote to poison, but also\r\nfreed the mind from vain fears. Late in mediæval times, the adamas\r\nwas invested with supernatural powers, and regarded as a spiritual\r\ncreation. And even in the commencement of the seventeenth century\r\nBoetius de Boot, in his treatise on gems, asserts that the diamond\r\npossesses wonderful metaphysical properties; but remarks that they do\r\nnot reside in the stone _per se_, but belong to the angelic spirits\r\nwhom it has pleased the Almighty to connect, in a mysterious manner,\r\nwith certain substances in nature.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\n                 THE TURKISH CASKET AND ANCIENT GEMS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Sultan of Turkey is said to possess many wonderful diamonds\r\nand other gems among the regalia and ornaments treasured up in the\r\nstrongholds of the Seraglio; but very little is known, definitely and\r\npositively, concerning them.\r\n\r\nIn 1840 the Sultan granted a firman to the Duke of Devonshire and a\r\nparty of friends, permitting them to examine the court-jewels. One\r\nof this party, my illustrious kinsman Dr. Cyrus Hamlin, has recently\r\ndescribed to me the impression they made upon his memory, more than\r\nthirty years ago. The number of articles was too great, and their\r\neffect too dazzling, for the memory to be able to particularize them\r\nafter so long an interval of time. He remembers that in two strongly\r\nbuilt rooms, and displayed on mats, or cushions of velvet, were a\r\nvast number of decorations and insignia, crescents, tiaras, clasps,\r\nand necklaces, etc. Among the latter was one of wondrous beauty and\r\nperfection, which the Sultan wished to present to the Princess of\r\nWales on her visit to Stamboul. The beautiful Princess wore it at the\r\nreception she gave the Sultan and his cabinet, but for various reasons\r\nwas obliged to return the magnificent gift.\r\n\r\nAmong the arms of former Sultans were the swords of Al-u-deen, and\r\nSolyman the Magnificent. Besides their historical renown, they\r\nwere interesting on account of their superb workmanship, and their\r\ndecorations with gems of wonderful beauty.\r\n\r\nIn 1880 an American traveller was admitted to a view of some of the\r\nrooms in the Treasury of the Seraglio, and from memory of what he saw\r\nthere wrote the following description:--\r\n\r\n “In the centre of the first room is a throne. It is a platform\r\n about two and one half feet square, with a cushion of cloth-of-gold\r\n embroidered with pearls, rubies, and diamonds. Around three sides of\r\n the cushion is a low rail supported by miniature columns, and standing\r\n about eight inches high. The whole body of the throne is overlaid\r\n with plates of gold, and the rail is studded with clusters of rubies\r\n symmetrically arranged. The first thought that strikes one on seeing\r\n this throne is the surpassing value of its jewels, and the second is\r\n the superlative discomfort of the concern viewed as a resting-place.\r\n The rail, which answers for arms and back, is perpendicular and\r\n rectangular, and could rest neither the arms nor the back of the\r\n enthroned Sultan. Uneasy the man that sits the throne, must be the\r\n Turkish equivalent of the proverb concerning the wearer of the crown.\r\n In one corner of the room is another throne, said to be the throne\r\n of Nadir Shah, of Persia. It is of some dark wood, delicately inlaid\r\n with ivory and pearl, and has a canopy of the same materials, from the\r\n centre of which hangs a great gold ball decorated with precious stones.\r\n\r\n “In one of the cabinets is the cradle of the imperial babies. It\r\n stands low on its rockers, like the cradles now in use in Turkey. The\r\n two ends rise a foot above the mattress, and are connected at the top\r\n by a bar which runs lengthwise of the cradle. The whole is of solid\r\n gold, and the outside of the cradle is crusted with pearls, diamonds,\r\n rubies, and turquoises.\r\n\r\n “In one of the galleries are the effigies of all the Sultans of\r\n Turkey down to Mahmoud the Reformer. The figures are dressed in what\r\n professes to be the state robes actually worn by the Sultans whom\r\n they represent. The costumes are all different, and differ very\r\n much in cut, indicating the changes of fashion during the last five\r\n hundred years. But all these dresses agree in the feature of richness.\r\n Cloth-of-gold and silk brocade are the materials, and many of the\r\n figures are weighed down with jewels. The swords or daggers which all\r\n of the figures wear are especially magnificent in their display of\r\n precious stones. The dagger of Sultan Mahomet II., the conqueror of\r\n Constantinople, has in its handle an emerald full two inches long and\r\n an inch thick. I use the adjective ‘thick’ advisedly, for solidity of\r\n splendor is the impression left on the mind by that emerald. All of\r\n these gentlemen wore large turbans, and bedecked their turbans with\r\n diamonds. The only exceptions are seen in the case of the boy Sultan,\r\n Osman II., who was killed by his janissaries before he had attained\r\n man’s estate, and in the case of Sultan Mahmoud, the Reformer,\r\n who alone of all his kinsmen appears in European broadcloth. His\r\n head-dress is the fez cap, with a plume of bird-of-paradise feathers\r\n fastened in place by a great spray of diamonds.\r\n\r\n “But there is no such thing as describing in detail the splendors\r\n of these rooms. There are antique arms and armor heavy with gold\r\n and jewels; there are innumerable horse-trappings and saddles,\r\n covered with plates of gold and studded with emeralds, rubies,\r\n topazes, diamonds, and pearls; there are saddle-cloths embroidered\r\n with precious stones. Several sofa-covers hang in the cabinets as\r\n background to the smaller articles. They are worth $150,000 apiece,\r\n and are heavy cloth-of-gold embroidered with seed pearls. In one of\r\n the cabinets are three uncut emeralds, the largest being the size of\r\n a man’s fist, and the smallest larger than a hen’s egg. The birds of\r\n the palace realized the experience of dwelling in cages of gold, for\r\n here they hang,--these ancient cages of gold wire. Some of the cages\r\n have a clock in the bottom, face downward, so that the royal household\r\n might see the time of day as they lolled on the divans beneath. The\r\n Imperial Princes appear to have gone to school in childhood, for here\r\n are the satchels in which they carried their books,--bags of velvet\r\n embroidered with gold and pearls and diamonds. In another place you\r\n see many mottoes from the Koran, embroidered in diamonds on red\r\n velvet. There are amber mouthpieces for pipes, studded with diamonds\r\n and rubies. There are coffee-sets and tea-sets of all degrees of\r\n magnificence; and vases of crystal and agate and onyx,--some of these\r\n profusely bejewelled. There are inkstands and snuff-boxes innumerable,\r\n all glittering with priceless gems. There are royal knives and forks\r\n and spoons of solid gold, with jewels on their handles. There is an\r\n immense array of clocks. One would suppose that every Sultan had his\r\n private clock, which ceased to tick when his heart stopped beating.\r\n\r\n “Among the articles in this imperial treasure-house are many\r\n which must be regarded simply as toys. Of such is a tea-set of\r\n tortoise-shell as thin as paper. Another toy is a lady’s parasol of\r\n white silk exquisitely embroidered with gold, the staff of which is\r\n a single branch of coral so long and true and well adapted to its\r\n purpose that one might search years and fail to find its like. There\r\n are also very many fans of varying degrees of splendor. Another one of\r\n the toys is a figure of a sultan seated on his throne under a golden\r\n canopy ribbed with alternate rubies and emeralds. The whole structure\r\n is, perhaps, six inches high. The body of the figure is a single\r\n huge pearl, the lower extremities are carved from a blue turquoise,\r\n and the turban is a solid mass of diamonds. There is literally no\r\n end to the marvels of this place. After every conceivable use has\r\n been made of jewels, the surplus unmounted stones are gathered by\r\n handfuls into crystal bowls at one end of the cabinets in the second\r\n room. The spoils of all the empires which preceded the Ottoman Empire\r\n are heaped up in these two dingy stone rooms in the old Seraglio at\r\n Constantinople.\r\n\r\n “It requires some time fully to realize the enormous wealth of this\r\n treasure-house. But slowly one becomes convinced that these treasures\r\n can only be the accumulation of centuries, and represent the heritage\r\n of the Ottomans from all their predecessors. Once assured of this,\r\n the traveller will find a peculiar fitness in the aspect and attitude\r\n of the guards of the place. They stand, dressed in spotless black\r\n broadcloth, four or five feet apart, in line along the cabinets,\r\n perfectly motionless. And they are solemn of countenance, as if\r\n standing by the catafalque of some deceased monarch lying in state for\r\n the homage of his subjects.\r\n\r\n “I first visited this place shortly after the late war with Russia.\r\n The Turkish Government was in sore straits for the means of daily\r\n existence. The Sultan had just sent his gold and silver plate to the\r\n mint to be coined in order to buy up the depreciated paper currency.\r\n The people of whole districts were at the verge of starvation because\r\n the $80,000,000 of paper money in circulation had lost its purchasing\r\n power. I was naturally incredulous as to the reality of what I had\r\n seen. If these jewels were real, their value must be sufficient to pay\r\n off the dishonored bonds of Turkey. It did not seem reasonable that\r\n the Turkish Government could have passed through such straits as those\r\n to which it had been reduced by the war without having recourse to\r\n their treasure-house. Multitudes of articles in those rooms have an\r\n immense antique and artistic value entirely aside from their intrinsic\r\n value.\r\n\r\n “I spoke in this strain to one of the officers of the Imperial Ottoman\r\n Bank, and he replied that the jewels were unquestionably genuine.\r\n He said that during the war the Turks borrowed $30,000,000 from\r\n the bank. The loan was to be secured by pledge of jewels from this\r\n treasure-house, and the bank officials were told to help themselves\r\n from its riches. They selected enough of the jewels to guarantee them\r\n amply against loss. These jewels were packed in three small boxes and\r\n removed to the vaults of the bank. But their removal left no gap in\r\n the great accumulation. Afterward I asked a Turk why the Government\r\n did not sell this treasure and be at ease. ‘Sell it?’ said the Turk;\r\n ‘why, it is the treasure of all the Sultans! It cannot be sold.’\r\n\r\n “So there is this treasure-house to-day--a grand relic of ancient\r\n splendor--in the hands of the broken, ruined remnant of the house of\r\n Osman. The possession of this enormous wealth must be a terrible\r\n temptation at times to the worn man who wears the Sacred Sword of\r\n Turkey. But he clings to it through all his adversity, for it is the\r\n only relic left to the Empire of the glory of its past.”\r\n\r\nTwo of the oldest authenticated diamonds in Europe belong to the\r\nSultan. One of them, a beautiful stone of twenty-four karats, and\r\nwhich adorns the aigrette of the Imperial plume on days of parade, was\r\nfound in Constantinople in the time of Mahomet IV. It was picked up\r\nby a poor man upon a heap of dirt not far from the gate of Egrikapon.\r\nThe finder had no idea of the value of his treasure, and sold it for a\r\ntrifle. Passing through the hands of several purchasers, the gem was\r\nfinally brought to the notice of the guild of goldsmiths, when its true\r\ncharacter was made known. It was then seized by the Grand Vizier and\r\nannexed to the Imperial treasures by an edict. The other diamond, which\r\nis of greater beauty and weight, was found by a child playing in the\r\nHaiwanserai, or the Hebdomon, during the reign of Mahomet II., or about\r\nthe middle of the fifteenth century. It was believed by the antiquaries\r\nthat these gems belonged to the treasures of ancient Byzantium, and\r\nthat the last may have adorned the crown of the Byzantine emperors.\r\nThis jewel was lost by the fault of the masters of the wardrobe on the\r\nplace of the Hebdomon during a triumphal march in the twenty-second\r\nyear of the reign of Justinian, or 548 A.D. We can learn nothing more\r\nconcerning the condition of these diamonds when found, but infer that\r\nthey were polished, otherwise they probably would not have attracted\r\nthe notice of the finders.\r\n\r\nLamartine and other historians of the Ottoman Empire allude to its\r\ntreasury as in reality a wonderful museum of art, whose wealth is\r\nunknown and perhaps incalculable. They state that in four vast\r\napartments beneath the Seraglio, vaulted subterraneously to shelter\r\nthem from the ravages of fire, are collected the sacred relics, the\r\njewels, the gems, and a great variety of objects of value that have\r\naccumulated since the origin of the monarchy. The antiquary may well\r\nsay in viewing this collection of treasure, “The spoils of the universe\r\nare here represented.” For whatever of value and historic worth was\r\nsaved from the wreck of Rome or preserved from the accumulations of\r\nthe Greek conquests was gathered at Byzantium. In this fatal Acropolis\r\nat the extreme point of the continent of Europe, the Greek Empire\r\nhad indeed collected all its monuments, all its masterpieces, all\r\nits riches, as if to tempt fate and render the prize all the more\r\nglittering to the eyes of the Ottomans.\r\n\r\nMany, if not the most, of these priceless relics and treasures fell\r\ninto the clutches of the Turks when Constantinople was won. Nothing\r\nescaped at that time. There is no doubt but that many remarkable gems\r\nwere captured at this period, but concerning their nature and their\r\nvalue history has left us but little more than conjecture.\r\n\r\nHowever, the historians speak definitely of the Greek emperors during\r\ntheir prosperity as displaying a magnificence worthy of the luxurious\r\nperiods of Rome. The costumes of these rulers are described as marvels\r\nof art, and their jewels as of inestimable price. The accounts remind\r\nthe reader of the descriptions left by Claudian of the treasures of\r\nTheodosius:--\r\n\r\n  “Sidonian mantles rich with purple fold,\r\n  Belts bossed with pearls, robes stiff with gems and gold,\r\n  And breastplates shining green with emeralds bright,\r\n  And helmets rich with precious sapphires dight.”\r\n\r\nThat diamonds were then used as gems and held in high estimation may\r\nbe inferred from the single remark of the indignant historian, “One\r\nman buys entire Syria with the diamonds of his wife.” Perhaps the word\r\ndiamond was thus used figuratively, and the expression referred to gems\r\nand jewels in general.\r\n\r\nBesides these accumulations of the Greeks, much of the spoil collected\r\nby Timour in his merciless sack of India and Persia came afterwards\r\ninto the possession of the Emirs of Asiatic Turkey, and eventually\r\ndrifted to Constantinople. What these treasures were may be imagined\r\nfrom the glowing descriptions given by the historians of the last\r\nscenes of the life and reign of the great Tatar conqueror. The\r\nmagnificent fêtes given by Timour on his return to Samarcand after the\r\nconquest of Arabia and Eastern Turkey, surpassed in historic splendor\r\neven the descriptions of Oriental fable. In the gigantic palace\r\nerected by him during the days of leisure between his conquests, and\r\nwhich was one of the marvels of the architectural world, he celebrated\r\nin a single day the marriage of six of his grandsons. The spoils of the\r\nuniverse were displayed in the decorations of the marriage feasts. The\r\nwealth of the Indies had been transferred to the home of the Tatar.\r\nPearls, sapphires, and diamonds were showered in profusion upon the\r\nmarried pairs. Nine times did they change their apparel, and, arrayed\r\nin different solid cinctures of a tissue of pearls and diamonds,\r\npresent themselves to the view of Timour,--the last festivities of the\r\ngreat Tatar chieftain.\r\n\r\nThis wonderful display of mediæval times recalls to the mind of\r\nthe antiquary the magnificent marriage feasts of Alexander and his\r\neighty lieutenants with their beautiful Persian brides. This historic\r\nfestivity took place in Persia 324 B. C., when the Greek army returned\r\nfrom India, and continued for five days. Like that of Timour, it\r\ndisplayed in its magnificence the gems and art treasures of conquered\r\nAsia. The diamond, however, does not appear. Art evidently had not\r\nthen acquired the process by which the natural and rough crystal is\r\ndeveloped into a gem of sparkling and lustrous beauty. And the selected\r\nbrides, to enhance their natural charms, wore pearls, emeralds, rubies,\r\nand turquoises wreathed among their tresses of hair, or in their\r\nnecklaces, amulets, anklets, and bracelets.\r\n\r\nAmong the treasures supposed to be gathered in these catacombs, of\r\nan Empire’s wealth at Constantinople, there is one especially dear\r\nto the _dilettante_,--the wondrous ring of Ahmed. Vanquished in the\r\nlong, bloody, and desperate battle fought upon the slopes of Olympus\r\nwhen entire Turkey was the prize, Ahmed offered to his victorious\r\nbrother Selim I. a single gem to purchase the honors of a tomb. This\r\nprecious stone was set in a ring richly chased in gold, and was the\r\ngift of Bajazet II. to the most beloved of his children. It was as\r\ndear as the ring Solomon wore, and which was gifted with wonderful\r\npowers extending even to the invisible world. But it was as fatal as\r\nthat which Polycrates cast into the sea as an offering to the gods for\r\nhis long-continued prosperity. History does not mention the nature of\r\nthis remarkable treasure, nor relate whether it was diamond, sapphire,\r\nor emerald. However, we may glean some idea as to its rarity and\r\nbeauty from the statement that the Genoese jewellers who were then the\r\ngem-venders of the world placed its value at a year’s revenue of all\r\nAsia Minor.\r\n\r\nThe antiquary may also find among these dusty and forgotten collections\r\nsome of the lost gems and beautiful works of art of ancient Rome, or,\r\nperhaps, the rich ornaments brought home by the Macedonian soldiers\r\nfrom their Eastern triumphs, or the holy relics which the Arabs removed\r\nfrom the Gothic treasury at Toledo, and concealed in their fortresses\r\nand fastnesses of Syria. In mediæval times the precious stones and all\r\nthat was marvellous in decorative art that fell into the hands of the\r\nGenoese and Venetian merchants went to Constantinople to adorn the\r\nmagnificence of the Turkish nobles. Whatever the Mamelukes had gathered\r\ntogether in their treasury in Egypt, rescued from the dust of the\r\ncatacombs, or wrested from the isolated strongholds of Western Africa,\r\nwas seized by one fell swoop of the Turkish horsemen and transferred to\r\nthe Bosphorus.\r\n\r\nThe extravagance of the Turkish nobility during some of the brilliant\r\nreigns of the Empire was extreme, and seems to belong to the golden\r\nage of fable rather than to the truthful periods of history. We can\r\nform some idea of the wealth of these favorites of the Sultans from the\r\nglowing descriptions left by the Ottoman historians.\r\n\r\nSinan-Pasha, the Turkish Marius, seven times exiled and seven times\r\nconsul, yet dying at last at eighty while conducting the army\r\nto Hungary, left a heritage worthy of a king. Among his immense\r\npossessions the historian enumerates thirty-two cuirasses incrusted\r\nwith rubies, fifteen strings of huge pearls, sixty bushels of fine\r\npearls, seven tablecloths bespangled with diamonds, all accumulated\r\nduring campaigns in Europe, Asia, and Africa. Another potentate,\r\nthe Grand Vizier Sokolli, exhibited a love of magnificence worthy\r\nof the most reckless Roman profligates. His garden, near Tokat, was\r\nthe wonder of Asia Minor, and was called the garden of Paradise,\r\n“Djennet-bagni.” Its parterres, instead of being covered with natural\r\nflowers, sparkled with rubies and precious stones imitating the form\r\nof flowers and surpassing them in splendor. This unique display of art\r\nwas finally destroyed by the victorious barbarian hordes from Asia,\r\nand the beautiful imitations of flowering vegetation were borne off\r\nto the distant steppes to be transferred into ornaments for arms and\r\nhorse-gear.\r\n\r\nIn forming a conjecture of the value of the treasures of the Turkish\r\nSeraglio, the antiquary naturally and justly recalls to memory the\r\nmagnificence of early history and the numerous spoliations of ancient\r\nnations that eventually fell into the grasp of the Greek and Roman\r\nEmperors. Let us follow briefly the historian among some of the\r\nfragments of history which relate to this subject, and seem to indicate\r\nthat the treasures of the earth gathered during the last two thousand\r\nyears in reality drifted in course of time and by the fortunes of war\r\nto the Greek Capitol. It is the sad epitome of man’s greatness and his\r\ninsignificance. For the pillage which graced the triumphs of the Greek\r\nand Roman arms not only represented the peaceful industry of nations,\r\nbut they were also often the memorials of the destruction of the\r\nearth’s fairest hopes.\r\n\r\nRome, in the height of her glory, displayed a magnificence worthy of\r\nthe valor of her arms and the magnitude of her conquests. Her temples\r\nwere profusely decorated with gems, and her nobles vied with each other\r\nin the possession of the rare and the beautiful. At times the Coliseum\r\nexhibited the wealth of the nation and the liberality of its rulers.\r\nThe poet who describes the games of Carinus affirms that the porticos\r\nof the immense edifice were gilded, and the extensive circles which\r\ndivided the ranks of spectators from each other were studded with a\r\nprecious mosaic of beautiful stones,--\r\n\r\n  “Balteus in gemmis in lita portico aureo\r\n  Certatim radiant,” etc.\r\n\r\nIn the triumphs of Rome the spoils of the last conquest were not only\r\ndisplayed, but the accumulated riches of the Empire were ostentatiously\r\nexhibited to view at the same time.\r\n\r\nTo give the reader an idea of the magnificence of these celebrations,\r\nwe will describe the triumphal entry into the eternal city by Aurelian\r\nwhen returning from the conquest of Palmyra and the nations situated\r\nalong the great commercial highways to Asia. This was one of the\r\ngreatest of the Roman triumphs, and spread a dazzling glory over the\r\nname of the conqueror. The pomp was opened by the stately procession of\r\ntwenty enormous elephants, followed by four royal tigers and more than\r\ntwo hundred of the most curious animals from all parts of the world.\r\nThen came a fierce and haughty band of sixteen hundred gladiators,\r\nselected for their beauty, strength, and skill. The wealth of Asia\r\nfollowed this vanguard of brute strength. Displayed in charming\r\narrangement or carelessly heaped in immense piles, the spectators\r\nwitnessed the arms, ensigns, and a vast collection of the objects of\r\nvalue and luxury of many conquered nations. Among the articles of\r\ngold were exhibited the numerous crowns of Aurelian, together with\r\nthe magnificent plate and wardrobe of the Syrian queen. Amidst this\r\nglittering array appeared the embassies of foreign and distant nations;\r\nand the ambassadors of Ethiopia, Arabia, Persia, India, and China,\r\nwith their brilliant or picturesque costumes, added greatly to the\r\ninterest and splendor of the scene. Following these came long trains\r\nof captives from various nations,--Goths, Vandals, Sarmatians, Gauls,\r\nSyrians, etc.,--with the ill-fated emperor, Tetricus, and his son,\r\ndressed in Gallic costume. But the most attractive figure of all to\r\nthe Roman populace was the beauteous form of the celebrated queen of\r\nthe Syrian deserts. Zenobia was on foot and alone. As if in mockery of\r\nhuman ambition, she preceded the magnificent chariot in which she once\r\nhoped to have entered Rome. Her elegant figure was shackled with solid\r\nchains of gold, while she tottered under the weight of the inestimable\r\njewels which adorned her natural graces. In the rear appeared the still\r\nmore sumptuous chariots of Odenatus and of the Persian monarch. The\r\ntriumphal car which carried Aurelian was resplendent with gems, and was\r\ndrawn by four stags.\r\n\r\nOne of the most magnificent exhibitions of extravagance and luxury of\r\nancient times was displayed on the march of Tiridates and his Parthian\r\nnobles, when they went to Rome to receive the nominal crown from the\r\nhand of Nero. Four thousand selected Parthian cavalry, clothed in rich\r\napparel, escorted the King. The entire expense of the journey, which\r\nlasted several months and amounted to more than thirty thousand dollars\r\na day, was paid by the Romans. The triumphal procession traversed Asia\r\nMinor, crossed the Hellespont, passed through upper Greece, around the\r\nAdriatic, and then down the peninsula to Rome.\r\n\r\nIt was a great day for Rome when the Parthians approached its walls.\r\nThe city was illuminated, and decorated with garlands and the movable\r\nwealth of the Empire. The Roman nobles were clad in white; and the\r\nsplendid Pretorian guards, glittering with their arms and decorations,\r\nwere drawn up in two lines stretching from the end of the Forum to the\r\nRostra. Through these lines of steel, flanked by a vast assemblage\r\nof citizens, Tiridates and his proud nobles marched to the Rostra,\r\nand received from the hands of Nero the promised diadem. The Empire\r\nimpoverished herself in this barbaric display and attempt to awe and\r\ncharm her haughtiest foe. The accumulated spoils of three hundred\r\ntriumphs at Rome formed a glittering prize to the minds of Alaric and\r\nhis devoted Goths.\r\n\r\nBut six years before the capture of the city, Rome displayed her\r\nmagnificence and her wealth in the ovation given to St. Melania on\r\nher return. The extent of the decoration of the temples and their\r\nshrines may be inferred from the quotations of the historians. Serena,\r\nthe wife of the Roman general, Stilicho, on great occasions wore a\r\nmagnificent necklace which she borrowed from the statue of Vesta. But\r\nthe protection of the goddess could not protect the unfortunate woman\r\nfrom being strangled by the Romans during the siege by the Goths.\r\n\r\nThe fame of these treasures had spread all over the known world.\r\nAnd to the Goths the beauty of gems and the delights of luxuries\r\nwere not entirely unknown. For, in previous times, they had invaded\r\nthe coasts of the Euxine Sea and sacked many of the rich cities,\r\nlike Trebizond. In the pillage of the city by the Goths, Alaric is\r\nsaid to have protected the consecrated plate and ornaments of the\r\ntemples; but he undoubtedly confiscated the most valuable and notable\r\nof the treasures. The booty of the army was immense; and when the\r\nvictorious soldiers took their departure the roads were incumbered\r\nwith the rich and weighty spoils. The haughty victors, clad in the\r\nvestments of unexpected luxury, might have been seen resting by the\r\nwayside, waited on by their captives,--the sons and daughters of Roman\r\nsenators,--drinking the wine of Italy in golden goblets, decorated with\r\ngems.\r\n\r\nThe treasures obtained by the Goths in the conquest and sack of Italy\r\nwere borne away with them to Gaul. Besides these, the Gothic chieftains\r\nare said to have possessed many valuable gifts from other nations. The\r\nrecord of these wonderful works of art has been lost; but a few scraps\r\nof history, here and there, give glimpses of marvellous treasures.\r\nWhen the Franks pillaged the palace at Narbonne in France, in the\r\nsixth century, they found many curious and costly ornaments of gold.\r\n\r\nBut most of the treasures and choice works were undoubtedly carried\r\nalong with the army into Spain, and deposited in the Gothic treasury\r\nat Toledo. These were eventually captured by the Saracens and sent\r\nto Damascus. Thus, by the singular fortunes of war, these remarkable\r\nand beautiful relics returned to the Holy Land whence some of them\r\nhad been taken centuries before. Among these articles was the famous\r\n“Missorium,” or great dish for the service of the table, weighing five\r\nhundred pounds. It was formed of solid gold of exquisite workmanship,\r\nrichly inlaid with gems, and was the pride of the Goths.\r\n\r\nThe wonderful emerald table, which has been so enthusiastically\r\ndescribed by the Arabian writers, was also seized at the same time. The\r\ntransparent top of this table was encircled with three rows of fine\r\npearls, supported on three hundred and sixty-five feet, formed of gold\r\nand gems. This superb piece of workmanship was valued at five hundred\r\nthousand pieces of gold.\r\n\r\nThe marriage feast of Adolphus, the successor of Alaric, with Placidia,\r\nthe daughter of the great Theodosius, was a memorable occasion in\r\nancient history. It was celebrated at Narbonne, and displayed the\r\nprodigality and magnificence of the Goths. The ceremony was performed\r\naccording to the lavish fashion of the Romans and the rude customs\r\nof the victors. Adolphus offered to his bride, in accordance with\r\nthe manner of his nation, the spoils of her country. Fifty beautiful\r\nyouths, attired in silken robes, presented the happy maiden with one\r\nhundred basins, one half of which were filled with gold, and the rest\r\nwere heaped with gems of an inestimable price. Such was the inconstancy\r\nof fortune in those days, and such the cruelty of the times, that only\r\na year after this grand event the beautiful woman, the daughter of a\r\nRoman emperor, and the wife of the Gothic chieftain, might have been\r\nseen marching on foot with a crowd of vulgar captives, in front of the\r\nhorse of the assassin of her beloved husband. However, a few short days\r\nafter the usurpation, the Gothic army, struck with pity and indignation\r\nat the sufferings of Placidia, attacked and slew her barbarous master.\r\n\r\nGenseric, with his Moors and Vandals, fiercer in their pillage than the\r\nGoths of Alaric, ravaged Rome for fourteen days and nights. Everything\r\nof value, sacred or profane, was seized and borne away to the galleys\r\nof the invaders. Even the Empress Eudoxia was rudely stripped of her\r\nornaments; and the holy relics, brought from Jerusalem by Titus and\r\nspared by Alaric, were taken from the temples and transferred to\r\nCarthage. One of the vessels, containing a part of the sacred utensils\r\nand other treasures, was shipwrecked on the same shore which a thousand\r\nyears later swallowed up the wonderful and blood-stained emeralds\r\nwhich Cortez wrested from Mexico and carried with him when wrecked\r\nwith the Admiral of Castile. The remainder were saved to swell the\r\nponderous pile of booty when Carthage fell before the arms and genius\r\nof Belisarius. All these treasures, the collections of the Moor and the\r\nVandal, were transported to the Bosphorus to enrich the city of the\r\nconquerors.\r\n\r\nTo the successful army and its general a triumph was decreed; and it\r\nwas the first Byzantium had ever seen. The display on this historic\r\noccasion was worthy of the army and its hero. The wealth of nations was\r\nbrought forth to heighten the splendor of the scene. Rich armor, golden\r\nthrones, chariots, varied forms of sculpture and furniture, statues,\r\nvases, and other objects of art, together with the holy relics of the\r\nJewish Temple, were displayed in the procession.\r\n\r\nBut the grandest object of all was presented by the noble and majestic\r\nform of Belisarius, marching on foot at the head of a band of his\r\nbravest officers. Later in life, at the capture of Ravenna, Belisarius\r\nobtained the treasures of the Gothic army, which had been collected\r\nin that stronghold. These were transferred to the Byzantine palace;\r\nbut the deserving general was deprived of his hard-won triumph, for\r\nJustinian had now become envious of the glory of his subject. The\r\nmagnificent spectacle of the booty was not exhibited to the populace;\r\nbut shown only to the flattering and subservient senate.\r\n\r\nThe results of the Persian conquests largely increased the number,\r\nvariety, and value of the art and gem collections at Constantinople.\r\nThe Persian monarch, Chosroes, to arrange and preserve the treasures\r\ngathered by rapine or tribute, constructed an elegant palace at\r\nDastagherd beyond the Tigris. In this stronghold, protected in a\r\nhundred vaults, were deposited most of the gold, silver, gems, silks,\r\naromatics, and other objects collected from Persia and other countries\r\nof Asia. All these fell into the bold hands of the Roman Emperor\r\nHeraclius; but a part of them, during an unlucky tempest, were lost\r\nin the waves of the Euxine Sea. In the capture of Tauris, Heraclius\r\nobtained what were supposed to have been the spoils of Crœsus, which\r\nhad been transported by Cyrus from the citadel of Sardes.\r\n\r\nOnce only, before the coming of the Turk, was Constantinople, during\r\nits many centuries of varied prosperity and adversity, subjected to\r\nserious pillage. Hostile armies had again and again surged up to its\r\nalmost impregnable walls, only to retire in discomfiture; and it seemed\r\nas though the grand old city was protected by some invisible agency\r\nfrom external violence. Internal dissension, however, was the bane of\r\nthe capital, and was the true cause of the success of the Latins, and\r\nfinally that of the Turks. The successful attack by the combined forces\r\nof the Latins and Venetians was one of the results of the Crusades. It\r\ntook place in the commencement of the thirteenth century.\r\n\r\nThe city, however, remained under the Latin power for only fifty-seven\r\nyears, when it was recaptured by a bold stroke of the Greeks. Injured\r\nby the pillage of the Latins, and many of its beautiful edifices\r\ndestroyed by fire during the siege or subsequent occupation, the\r\nGreek capital not only lost its prestige of divine protection, but it\r\nhas never recovered its former splendor. How much of the spoils were\r\nremoved by the captors is a matter of conjecture. The historians of the\r\nGreeks and Latins--the spoiled and spoiler--undoubtedly exaggerate the\r\ninjury of the conquest and the quantity of booty obtained.\r\n\r\nTwo of the Emperors, succeeding by usurpation, fled from the city\r\nwith much treasure before it was finally captured. Even then one\r\nquarter of the accepted plunder was reserved for the elected ruler\r\nof Constantinople. And as to the remainder, which is said to have\r\nbeen divided equally between the French and Venetians, and valued at\r\n11,125,000 marks of silver, or $11,000,000, there is no record extant\r\nof the articles. We know that the bronze horses of the Hippodrome\r\nwere transferred to Saint Mark’s Palace, and the crown of thorns\r\nto the Sainte Chapelle at Paris. We also learn that many gems-the\r\nadamas, emerald, jacinth, ruby, sapphire--were among the spoils; but\r\nif the sack was complete, why did Venice years afterwards offer ten\r\nthousand ducats for the seamless vesture of the Redeemer, which was\r\nthen among the sacred reliquaries of Constantinople? If these spoils\r\nwere divided between the conquerors, how explain the fact recorded in\r\nFrench history, that the sacred relics sent to Paris and placed in\r\nthe church erected to receive them were purchased? It is a matter of\r\nhistory that the crown of thorns, with the piece of the true cross, the\r\nantique gems, and other relics that were deposited in Sainte Chapelle,\r\ntogether with the construction of the building, cost Saint Louis of\r\nBaldwin, Emperor of Constantinople, a sum of money equal to 2,800,000\r\nfrancs. This fact, coupled with the offer of the Venetians for the\r\nholy vestment, renders the accounts of the sack of the city still more\r\nobscure. The historian Yriarte declares that the only monuments of art\r\ndeemed by the Venetians as worthy of transporting to their capital were\r\nthe famous bronze horses. If this statement is correct, the Venetians\r\nmust have been sadly deficient in taste, or history has wrongfully\r\naccused the founders of Constantinople of spoliation.\r\n\r\nAccording to the early accounts, Constantine, in the reconstruction\r\nof Byzantium, despoiled the cities of Asia and Greece of their most\r\nvaluable ornaments, the trophies of memorable wars, the objects of\r\nreligious veneration, the most finished statues of the gods and heroes,\r\nof the sages and poets, of ancient times. The most celebrated works\r\nof the age of Pericles and Alexander were remorselessly seized by\r\nthe Emperor and transferred to his capital to enhance its beauty and\r\nits renown. So many statues and architectural masterpieces had been\r\ntransported to the Bosphorus that the historian Cedrenus ironically\r\nsaid, “Nothing in this great city was wanting except the souls of\r\nthe illustrious men whom those admirable monuments were intended to\r\nrepresent.”\r\n\r\nIn the reign of Justinian the city was decorated by the best of living\r\nartists. In the construction of the public edifices, the richest\r\nmaterials were sought for and used with lavish hand. The bright hues,\r\nthe primitive lustre, of many of the stones of which the buildings were\r\ncomposed were so remarkable as to form the theme of a poet. Distant\r\ncountries were explored for choice materials. The costly marbles of\r\nAsia, Gaul, Greece, and Africa were transported to the Bosphorus.\r\nAmong the rare stones used by the Greek architects, one may recognize\r\nin the ruins of the present day, the emerald-green marble of Laconia,\r\nthe golden-hued of Mauritania, the black of Gaul, and the purple and\r\nred, with intersecting veins of sea-green, of Phrygia. The shrine which\r\nstood in the Mosque of Saint Sophia a thousand years ago or more must\r\nhave been of marvellous beauty. The wealth and energy of the ancient\r\nworld was expended upon it; and we can form some picture of it in our\r\nimagination from the fact that the Emperor Justinian, on beholding it\r\nafter its completion, exclaimed, with outstretched arms, “Solomon, I\r\nhave surpassed thee.”\r\n\r\nThe magnificence displayed by the wealthy houses of Byzantium in their\r\ninternal arrangements must have been of an extraordinary character\r\nif we can judge correctly from the invectives of Chrysostom; and\r\nthe utensils of silver and gold were in massiveness far beyond the\r\nprodigality of modern times. Ramusio, the Venetian historian, dazzles\r\nthe reader with his glittering descriptions of the acquisitions of his\r\ncountrymen. He mentions with preciseness the vases whose forms were as\r\ngrotesque and varied as the caprice of man,--the murrhines Pompey won\r\nin his triumphs over Mithridates and Tigranes; chalices decked with\r\ngems or formed of turquoise, jasper, and amethyst; crowns of gold,\r\nstudded with pearls; unnumbered emeralds, sapphires, topazes, jacinths,\r\nand other gems; also the matchless carbuncles which afterwards adorned\r\nthe altar at Saint Mark’s, and which were believed by the superstitious\r\nto have the power of dissipating the darkness by their refulgent beams\r\nof light.\r\n\r\nConstantinople, with its remaining works of art, again fell into the\r\npower of the Greeks and was retained by them until captured by the\r\nTurks. To describe the treasures of the Greek capital before its\r\ncapture, and correctly estimate the character and value of the objects\r\nremoved, and those secreted and again brought to light, will be a\r\ndifficult task for some restless antiquary. We are, however, inclined\r\nto believe the Greeks successfully secreted many of their choicest\r\ngems. All through the pages of early and mediæval history, the reader\r\nwill observe that by a strange caprice of fortune many of the richest\r\nand rarest works of art and nature passed into the possession of the\r\nrulers of Byzantium, Constantinople, or Stamboul. These three names,\r\ndistinct in their meaning, yet relate to one and the same city, which,\r\nduring its existence of more than a thousand years, passed successively\r\nunder the sway of the Roman, the Greek, and the Turk. Stamboul is still\r\nthe Mecca of the antiquary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\n                           RUSSIAN REGALIA.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe empire of Russia has the most splendid collection of diamonds of\r\nany country in the world, with the exception, perhaps, of Persia. In\r\nthe Kremlin at Moscow, and the Winter Palace at St. Petersburg, are\r\npreserved a multitude of gems of the highest perfection and beauty,\r\nand also many interesting ornaments formed or captured by the early\r\nrulers of Russia. Possessing many of the avenues of approach and trade\r\nwith the countries of Central and Southern Asia, this country has long\r\nenjoyed excellent facilities for obtaining the gems from Upper India\r\nand Persia. The enormous quantity the treasury still possesses, added\r\nto the great number given away in past times by various sovereigns,\r\nnaturally gives rise to the inquiry, whence this great abundance of\r\nprecious stones came. We may say that this grand accumulation commenced\r\nin the earliest days of the Russian dynasty, and has been steadily\r\nincreasing by direct intercourse with the gem-producing countries.\r\n\r\nMany of the fine gems that fell into the hands of the Turks in their\r\nvarious conquests, have indirectly passed, by purchase or otherwise,\r\ninto the possession of the Russians.\r\n\r\nSome others recall the times of the incursions of the Cossacks of the\r\ntenth century, when the fearless hordes of the North marched even to\r\nthe gates of Constantinople, and imposed menaces and ransoms upon the\r\nGreek emperors.\r\n\r\nThe crafty policy of the Russian dates back from those distant times.\r\n“Let us be content,” said the old Russian chieftain to his impetuous\r\nwarriors complaining of treaties and tributes; “is it not better to\r\nobtain, without fighting, the gold, the silver, the silk, the precious\r\nstones of these people?”\r\n\r\nThe still earlier Scythians, with their light active horse, performed\r\nincredible journeys even into Illyricum and Thrace. The river Danube\r\noffered but a slight barrier to these fearless riders; and they boldly\r\ntraversed flood, forest, and plain, sweeping, with impunity and menace,\r\neven up to the walls of Byzantium. They pillaged, without remorse, the\r\nrich towns and country palaces of the nobles, and returned to their\r\nforest wilds accompanied by thousands of captives, and laden with booty\r\nof immense value.\r\n\r\nWe are also reminded by the historian, that a part of Russia,\r\nespecially Poland, was the Sarmatia of the ancients, whence issued\r\nthe fearless swarms of invincible Huns and Goths and Sclavonians, who\r\nspread desolation at various times over nearly the whole of Europe.\r\nAlthough these fierce hordes seldom returned to their native plains,\r\npreferring the sunnier portions of the conquered countries, yet they\r\ndid not abandon all communication with the land of their birth. Many of\r\ntheir incursions into the Roman provinces were rewarded with immense\r\nbooty of captives, and a variety of plunder. For fifteen hundred years\r\nthe customs of the Poles were but little changed. The love of nomadic\r\nlife, of magnificence, of arms, dress, ornaments, was a predominating\r\ntrait until a very recent period. The famous political assemblies of\r\nthe Poles on the plain of Volo were among the grandest displays of\r\nbarbaric splendors of any age; and sometimes one hundred thousand Poles\r\nwere assembled in conclave.\r\n\r\nThe chivalry, the wealth of the country, was represented there. All\r\nthe nobles and citizens of note attended, mounted upon the finest\r\nhorses, and caparisoned and decorated in the most lavish manner. As the\r\nhistorian says, “The children of the desert strove to hide the furs and\r\nskins in which they were clothed, under chains of gold and the glitter\r\nof jewels. Their bonnets were composed of panther skin; plumes of\r\neagles or herons surmounted them; on their front were the most splendid\r\nprecious stones. Their robes of sable or ermine were bound with\r\nvelvet or silver; their girdles studded with jewels; over all their\r\nfurs were suspended chains of diamonds. One hand of each nobleman was\r\nwithout a glove; on it was the splendid ring on which the arms of his\r\nfamily were engraved,--the mark, as in ancient Rome, of the equestrian\r\norder,--another proof of the intimate connection between the race, the\r\ncustoms, the traditions of the Northern tribes, and the founders of the\r\nEternal City.” But nothing in this rivalry of magnificence could equal\r\nthe splendor of their arms: double poniards, double scimetars set with\r\nbrilliants; bucklers of costly workmanship; battle-axes enriched in\r\nsilver and glittering with emeralds and sapphires.\r\n\r\nAfter reviewing the history of ancient and mediæval Poland, we are\r\nnot surprised at the accumulation of gems in Russia, nor at the fact\r\nthat some of the fine gems now in the modern cabinets of Europe were\r\nobtained from that country. For instance, the splendid green diamond of\r\nDresden came from Warsaw.\r\n\r\nThe grand repository of the Empire is in the towers of the Kremlin;\r\nand here are preserved the sacred relics and the almost innumerable\r\ntreasures of the Empire. In the galleries of this ancient castle of\r\nthe Muscovites are gathered such an accumulation of wonders that the\r\nvisitor is fairly dazzled, and is forcibly reminded of the tales of\r\nEastern romance, of the munificence of the store-house of the Caliph\r\nHaroun-Al-Raschid, and the wells of Aboul Kasem.\r\n\r\nDiamonds, rubies, sapphires, emeralds, topazes, and other gems, of\r\nlarge size and wondrous beauty, flash from every side of the apartment;\r\nand their profusion astonishes the mineralogist, who has been\r\naccustomed to regard these natural treasures as rare. It will be quite\r\nimpossible to enumerate or explain properly the glittering arrangement\r\nof these marvellous works of art and nature. The sceptres, the crowns,\r\nthe caskets, the reliquaries, the globes, thrones, and the insignia\r\nof religion and royalty collected here, fairly dazzle the eye by the\r\nreflections from the immense number of gems which decorate them. The\r\nscene reminds one of the prismatic effect of the rays of the morning or\r\nevening sun upon the numberless raindrops on the grass, after a shower\r\nhas passed.\r\n\r\nHere we shall find the crowns of the Muscovite Czars, together with the\r\ncaptured diadems and regalia of the countries that form a part of this\r\nvast realm. Among them may be seen, in all of their original quaintness\r\nand splendor, the crowns of Siberia, Novgorod, Kazan, Moscow, Poland,\r\nand the Crimea. To this imperial display we may expect to see added, at\r\nno distant day, the jewels of the Southern countries, which seem to be\r\nthe inevitable heirlooms of the sagacious Cossack.\r\n\r\nTo describe correctly, and in a proper manner, the works of ancient,\r\nmediæval, and modern art collected here, would require a large volume\r\nby itself. We will, however, attempt to give a brief description\r\nof some of the beautiful crowns, which, though generally of rude\r\nworkmanship, are yet studded with gems of an immense value, and are\r\nalso objects of great historic interest.\r\n\r\nForemost of all, appears the magnificent diadem worn by the former\r\nEmpress Anna Ivanovna, and which is, perhaps, one of the most splendid\r\njewels of its kind in the world. It is well proportioned, and lightly\r\nformed of open gold work, incrusted with a vast number of exquisite\r\ngems, and among them 2,536 diamonds of great perfection. On its top,\r\nserving as a base to a slender cross of pearls, is placed the immense\r\nand wonderful ruby, which the Russian ambassador purchased at Pekin, at\r\nthe price of 120,000 roubles.\r\n\r\nThe crown of Vladimir, which is used at the crowning of the heir to\r\nthe throne, is composed of filigree gold-work, surmounted by a cross\r\nof plain gold, with a large pearl on each arm. It is surrounded at its\r\nbase by a band of sable fur, and is ornamented with 4 fine emeralds, 2\r\nrubies, and 25 pearls.\r\n\r\nThis crown was a gift from the Emperor Alexis Comnenus, and was brought\r\nwith ceremony from Constantinople, by a Greek embassy, in the year 1116.\r\n\r\nThis circumstance recalls to memory the history and fate of the last of\r\nthe Comnenuses, the self-styled Emperor of Trebizond, and who afforded\r\nso many themes of ridicule to the knights and troubadours of the\r\nfifteenth century.\r\n\r\nIn connection with our subject, it may be proper to give a sketch of\r\nthe appearance of this potentate when he gave an audience to foreign\r\nambassadors.\r\n\r\nHis dress was a tight gown of scarlet silk; around his neck, down the\r\nfront of his gown, and around the bottom of it, were bands of gold\r\nabout four inches wide; these were edged with pearls, and ornamented\r\nwith large rubies and emeralds in rows down the centre of each band\r\nof gold. On his arms, above the elbows, were golden armlets, and\r\naround his wrists gold bracelets, all set with precious stones of\r\nvarious colors. His girdle was of the same pattern, about three inches\r\nwide, and had a hanging end about two feet long, which the Byzantine\r\nemperors, for some undiscovered reason, always carried over the left\r\narm. In his right hand he bore a golden sceptre about three feet long,\r\nwith a large cross at the top, set with enormous pearls. On his head he\r\nwore a close golden crown, of which the top was arranged in metal like\r\na helmet. From this crown a fillet set with pearls hung down on each\r\nside of his face as far as his beard, which was of considerable length.\r\nScarlet silk hose and golden sandals completed the Imperial costume,\r\nexcept two round ornaments of gold, each of the size of a plate, which\r\nwere affixed to his robe on the outside of his thigh.\r\n\r\nSuch was the appearance of this vain ruler when he gave audience to\r\nthe envoys of Mahomet II., the conqueror of Constantinople. The plain\r\nsteel-clad warriors of the Sultan briefly said, “Wilt thou secure thy\r\ntreasures and thy life by resigning thy kingdom; or wilt thou rather\r\nforfeit thy kingdom, thy treasures, and thy life?”\r\n\r\nThe sceptre of Vladimir is also preserved here. It is about three feet\r\nlong, and contains among its ornaments 268 diamonds, 360 rubies, and 15\r\nemeralds. The enamel covering of the rest of the surface, unadorned\r\nby the gems, represents religious subjects, painted and treated in the\r\nByzantine style.\r\n\r\nThe tiara of Astrakhan is far more complex in its construction, and is\r\nvery rich in barbaric taste. It is now known as the gold Imperial Crown\r\nof the First Order of the Czar; and is a tall, imposing structure,\r\ncovered with brilliant gems. Among them are many fine rubies, emeralds,\r\npearls, and an enormous sapphire of great value.\r\n\r\nThe crown of Kazan, captured in 1553 by John IV., is a very interesting\r\nspecimen of mediæval workmanship, and shows the influence of Persian\r\nart in its arrangement. It is of gold filigree-work, intermixed with\r\nblack, and is adorned with splendid rubies, turquoises, and pearls. On\r\nthe summit is placed a very large ruby, surmounted with two pearls.\r\n\r\nThe ornament known as the diamond cap of the Czar is a singular\r\ncombination of the rude and the beautiful in art. It is profusely\r\ngarnished with 817 diamonds of the first water, besides 4 magnificent\r\nrubies and 8 emeralds. This is also surmounted with an enormous ruby,\r\nwhich sustains on its summit a solid Greek cross, composed of gems and\r\npearls set in gold.\r\n\r\nWe have not space to describe the remaining diadems of ancient rulers,\r\nor those of recent times, nor the rich breast-crosses, the sceptres,\r\nand the various regalia used in the coronation of the Russian Emperors,\r\nbut will mention the Grand Imperial Orb, before proceeding to the\r\ndescription of the ancient and curious thrones.\r\n\r\nThe Orb is an immense globe of gold, heavily chased and richly\r\nincrusted with large and beautiful gems. It is surmounted with a tall\r\nGreek cross, also studded with precious stones of the purest water and\r\ncolor. It is of Byzantine workmanship, as early as the tenth century,\r\nand is said to have served as model for several other ornaments of this\r\ncharacter, made at Venice in later times. The upper portion of the\r\nexterior of the globe is arranged in four triangular spaces, whereon\r\nare enamelled in color scenes from the life of David. Among the gems\r\nwhich are set in enamelled gold are 58 diamonds, 89 rubies, 23 blue\r\ngems(?), 50 emeralds, and 38 pearls.\r\n\r\nThe three unique chairs used as thrones in the coronations of the\r\nrulers of Russia are objects of historical interest and are of great\r\nvalue intrinsically. The smallest of the three, designated as the\r\nStool, is the most ancient of all, having been presented in 1605 by\r\nShah Abbas of Persia to the Czar Boris Godunoff. It is completely\r\ncovered with polished sheets of beaten gold decorated with pearls and\r\nprecious stones. The second seat is in the form of a high-back chair\r\nof rude workmanship, and is intended for the reigning Empress, and\r\nis called the Golden Throne. Although its proportions are uncouth, a\r\nmine of wealth has been expended in its decorations, and it is inlaid\r\nwith 1,500 rubies, 8,000 turquoises, 2 magnificent topazes, and 4 rare\r\namethysts. The third chair, of rude construction, was made as early as\r\n1660, and is intended for the Emperor, and designated as the Diamond\r\nThrone. It is literally a mass of sparkling diamonds; and every portion\r\nof the chair is aglow with brilliant colored flashes of the diamonds,\r\nso profusely is this gem used in its decoration. The rude and imperfect\r\ncutting of these beautiful stones indicates their Oriental origin as\r\nwell as their antiquity.\r\n\r\nThe Priests’ Treasury in the Kremlin is a wonderful accumulation of\r\nwealth. We will attempt to describe but one of the articles to be\r\nseen there. In a golden casket studded with the finest gems may be\r\nseen some ancient holy relics given by one of the Greek Emperors of\r\nConstantinople. Among them there is a fragment of stone from the tomb\r\nof Christ, and a bit of wood from the cross. The elegance and richness\r\nof the casket will remind the antiquary of the receptacle of the tooth\r\nof Buddha, which was formerly preserved at Kandy, the capital of Ceylon.\r\n\r\nThis relic was kept in a golden casket incrusted with the finest\r\ngems. This was also encased in four other boxes, all of which were\r\nstudded with precious stones of enormous value, and forming together a\r\npriceless reliquary to which none of the shrines of civilized countries\r\ncould offer an equal in comparison, not excepting that of the famous\r\nVirgin of Loretto in Italy.\r\n\r\nIn the great hall devoted to the collection of arms and armor may be\r\nseen a great number of articles highly interesting to the antiquary\r\nand historian. Arms and armor of all periods from Europe and Asia are\r\nrepresented here,--the plain steel-clad vestments of the Crusader;\r\nthe richly chased and inlaid coats of mail of the knights of mediæval\r\ntimes; the light defences of the Persian and Saracen horsemen,\r\nglittering with those gems which were supposed to possess the power of\r\naverting fatal missiles; the casques of the Circassian mountaineers,\r\nbrilliant with barbaric decorations; scimetars, bucklers, scabbards,\r\nand a great variety of other arms, resplendent with the most beautiful\r\nof the rarest and most precious stones.\r\n\r\nThere is also a most costly and unique collection of saddles and\r\nhorse-gear to be seen. These are mostly presents of Emperors of\r\nConstantinople in early times, and from Grand Turks and Persian Shahs\r\nof later periods. Some of these are of great value and contain gems of\r\nhistoric interest. Their decorations are profuse; and the bits, curbs,\r\nbridles, headstalls, and, in fact, all portions of the trappings that\r\nwill admit of the setting of precious stones, are literally incrusted\r\nwith splendid gems, forming stars, suns, and various ornaments of\r\ngrotesque shapes.\r\n\r\nIn one of the rooms of the Winter Palace at St. Petersburg are\r\ndeposited many of the jewels of the Empire, and especially those\r\nrequired in the court ceremonies.\r\n\r\nAmong them may be seen the beautiful crowns and coronets of the late\r\nEmperor and Empress. The crown of the Emperor is of magnificent\r\nworkmanship, and dazzles the eye with the splendor of its gems. In\r\noutline it resembles the dome-formed patriarchal mitre, which was a\r\nfavorite shape among the Byzantines. Upon the summit appears a cross\r\nformed of five beautiful diamonds, which is also supported by a large\r\nspinel ruby, polished, but not faceted. This ruby and cross are\r\nsupported by a foliated arch composed of eleven great diamonds and\r\nrising from the back and front of the base of the crown. On either\r\nside of this central arch is attached a hoop formed of thirty-eight\r\nlarge and perfect pearls. The spaces on either side of these arches\r\nare filled with leaf-work and ornaments in silver, incrusted with\r\ndiamonds underlaid with the richest purple velvet. The band which forms\r\nthe base of the crown is of gold, and is ornamented with twenty-eight\r\nmagnificent diamonds.\r\n\r\nThe coronet of the Empress is thought to be the most beautiful\r\ncollection of diamonds ever presented to the view in a single ornament.\r\nIt is composed of four very large diamonds of the purest water, and\r\neighteen others of slightly smaller size, together with a multitude of\r\nlesser diamonds of exquisite water. The flash of these beautiful gems\r\nreminds the observer of a collection of rainbows.\r\n\r\nAmong the other regalia of this collection may be seen the most\r\nremarkable necklace of diamonds in Europe. In the links which form the\r\nchain are twenty-two huge brilliants of great value, and, as pendants\r\nto the connecting chain, fifteen other diamonds of surprising size\r\nappear, forming an ornament of great beauty.\r\n\r\nIn this room may also be seen the plume of Russia’s great general,\r\nSuvaroff. It is an aigrette composed entirely of diamonds of wonderful\r\nlustre, and was the gift of the Sultan of Turkey.\r\n\r\nAmong the curiosities preserved here are the Order of Saint Andrew,\r\nmounted with five pink diamonds; also two of the famous Siberian\r\nberyls,--one green, the other blue,--surrounded in their settings with\r\ndiamonds.\r\n\r\nIn the museum of the Hermitage, adjoining the Winter Palace, may be\r\nseen one of the finest and largest collections of gems in the world.\r\nIt is composed of choice selections from some of the most celebrated\r\ncabinets that have been formed in Europe during the past two centuries,\r\nand comprises the better portions of those known as the collection of\r\nthe Duke of Orleans (Philippe Egalité), that of the famous Strozzi, and\r\nthat of the Beverly, which had been formed under the direction of the\r\nlearned antiquary Dutens. The cabinet is not only extremely valuable in\r\nits art treasures, in the form of engraved gems and cameos, ancient,\r\nmediæval, and modern, but it is a noble monument of the good taste and\r\nliberality of the sovereigns of Russia. The description of these alone\r\nwould require a ponderous volume.\r\n\r\nIn another gallery in the same palace may be seen the plume of Prince\r\nPotemkin, glittering with gems of the purest ray, presented to him by\r\nthe Sultan of Turkey; also the two magnificent bouquets of artificial\r\nflowers composed of the finest colored diamonds, topazes, pearls,\r\nsapphires, rubies, and other gems, which rival in their hues the most\r\nbeautiful of the productions of the vegetable kingdom; the identical\r\nparrot which was carved from a single emerald, and given by King Pedro\r\nII. of Portugal, to his bride, the Princess of Savoy; together with a\r\nvast number of priceless objects of virtu of various ages, many of them\r\nprofusely decorated with interesting and valuable gems. The Hermitage,\r\nlike the Green Vaults at Dresden, is one of the jewel-boxes of the\r\ncivilized world.\r\n\r\nIn the museum of the School of Mines at St. Petersburg may be seen the\r\nfinest collection of the gems in their natural and rough condition\r\nin the world, not even excepting the magnificent collections of the\r\nBritish Museum, or that of the Jardin des Plantes in Paris. The\r\nglittering treasures of Siberia are here displayed in lavish profusion.\r\nNatural crystals of diamond, of chrysoberyl, of topaz, beryl, and\r\nemerald attest, by their beautiful forms, the great mineral wealth of\r\nthat vast country. The crystals of emerald are enormous and exceed\r\nin size all others in the world. The topazes are unsurpassed in\r\ntheir beauty and variety of tints. The collection of beryls is truly\r\nwonderful, and contains specimens of exquisite color and of great\r\nvalue. They may be seen not only of green, blue, white, and yellow,\r\nbut even pink, which is an exceedingly rare hue for this mineral. The\r\ncabinet of tourmalines is superb, and nobly illustrates the beauty and\r\nvariety of colors and forms of that wonderful mineral.\r\n\r\nIn the arsenal of the Alexander Palace may be seen a curious and\r\nvaluable collection of arms and armor of all ages, and among them\r\nmany ornaments beautifully worked in precious stones. Prominent among\r\nthem are the two sets of horse-gear which came as presents from the\r\nSultan of Turkey. The first is a souvenir of the conclusion of that\r\npeace which was signed at Adrianople when the Cossacks had passed the\r\nbarriers of the Balkan Mountains and almost clutched the long-coveted\r\nprize of Istamboul in their grasp. It is superb in its construction,\r\nwith its mountings and stirrups of gold, and its velvet trappings\r\nstudded with flashing diamonds. But the second saddle is even far\r\nsuperior in its ornaments and its effects to the first. It is indeed a\r\nglorious specimen of Persian handicraft and ornamentation, and worthy\r\nof one of the heroes of the Arabian Nights. It fairly glitters with the\r\nmultitude of diamonds of which it is composed, and some of which are of\r\ngreat size and wondrous lustre. It is indeed a barbaric mine of wealth.\r\n\r\nThis costly present was given to the Czar by the Sultan after the\r\nfatal battle of Konieh, when the Porte supplicated Russia to send an\r\nauxiliary force to defend a tottering throne against the attacks of a\r\nrebellious vassal.\r\n\r\nMany of the cathedrals, convents, and monasteries of Russia are\r\nrichly endowed with gems and jewels of great beauty and value. In the\r\nKazan Cathedral at St. Petersburg may be seen the miraculous image of\r\nthe Virgin brought from Kazan in 1579. It is covered with gold, and\r\nincrusted with diamonds and other gems. The sacristy of the Monastery\r\nof Solovetsk is one of the richest in the realm, and is filled with\r\njewels and gems which have been presented in times past by kings,\r\nprinces, and nobles.\r\n\r\nIn the Cathedral of the Archangel Michael, in Moscow, there are some\r\nancient reliquaries adorned with gems of remarkable beauty. The\r\ndiamonds, however, are surpassed by the magnificent emeralds.\r\n\r\nIn the sacristy of the Holy Synod in Moscow are preserved some\r\nwonderful sacerdotal robes and ornaments. One of the sakkos of crimson\r\nvelvet is so heavily laden with diamonds, rubies, pearls, emeralds,\r\netc., that its weight amounts to fifty-four pounds. The great mitre\r\nis also so studded with gems, such as the finest diamonds, rubies,\r\nemeralds, pearls, and sapphires, that it weighs five and a half pounds.\r\nThe decoration of these sacred objects has been made by lavish hands\r\nand from an abundance of the most costly materials.\r\n\r\nThe famous Convent of Troitza possesses rare and beautiful gems and\r\njewels among its gifts and reliquaries, which are well worthy of\r\nexamination by _dilettanti_. From a great variety of sources these\r\nriches have accumulated. The shrine has been famous for many centuries\r\npast; and czars, princes, boyars, and peasants have deposited their\r\nofferings both in ostentation as well as with the hope of divine\r\ndispensation.\r\n\r\nIts treasury is indeed a colossal jewel-box, whose wealth must amount\r\nto many millions in value, and which rivals, if it does not surpass\r\nin richness, the famous shrine of Loretto in Italy. The variety of\r\narticles decorated with gems exhibited here is marvellous. Art has made\r\nuse of the precious stones in her decorations with lavish hand. Some of\r\nthe frames in which are set sacred pictures are literally composed of\r\ngems of the largest size and also costly in price. Even the robes of\r\nthe Madonnas are spangled with diamonds, rubies, sapphires, topazes,\r\nand emeralds, forming the richest mosaics.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible, from the imperfect information we have received from\r\ntravellers concerning this wonderful museum of ancient and mediæval\r\nart, to give an accurate account of its treasures; but we hope some of\r\nthe learned antiquaries of Western Europe may be induced to examine\r\nthem, and make known their history. Among the great numbers of engraved\r\ngems, skilled search may reveal some of the most beautiful forms of\r\nancient art, and supply some of the missing links in glyptic history.\r\n\r\nAccording to these vague accounts a volume might be written on the\r\ndescription of the _armoires_, among which are comprised Bibles,\r\nGospels, liturgical books, bound with covers of silver gilt and\r\nincrusted with precious stones, such as the onyx, sardonyx, agate,\r\nchrysoprase, aqua-marinas, lapis lazuli, malachite, turquoise. The\r\nclasps of these volumes are made of gold or silver, in which antique\r\ncameos are set. Among the sacred utensils and relics are described\r\nchalices of gold belted with rows of diamonds, and a great variety of\r\nvessels richly ornamented; also crosses studded with beautiful emeralds\r\nand rubies; sapphire rings; vases and chandeliers of silver; dalmatics\r\nof brocade embroidered with flowers composed of gems, and with legends\r\nin old Sclavonic, written in pearls; enamelled censers; triptychs\r\nstoried with countless figures. Besides these articles we have\r\nenumerated, the museum contains a great number of others, including\r\nimages of saints and Madonnas richly decorated, masses of precious\r\nmetals, and heaps of precious stones in their natural state. What a\r\nglorious field of study for the amateur and the historian is presented\r\nhere!\r\n\r\nAmong the paragons possessed by the Crown is the diamond known as\r\nthe Orloff, which derives its name from one of the counts of that\r\ncelebrated family, who purchased it for the Empress Catherine. It is\r\none of the finest gems in the world, and is the largest in Europe. It\r\nrivals in beauty the famous Regent of the French regalia, which it\r\nsurpasses in size. The weight of this diamond is 194³⁄₄ karats, and it\r\nis exactly of the form of the famous diamond described by Tavernier as\r\nthe Great Mogul. In shape it is ovoid, or rather, in gem nomenclature,\r\nof a high-crowned rose-pattern. It is possible that this gem is the\r\nlong-lost Mogul. Were it not for the remarkable accuracy of the\r\ndistinguished French traveller, we should at once pronounce the Orloff\r\nto be the missing Mogul. Hence the question arises, may not Tavernier\r\nhave made an error in his calculation of weight? It is certainly very\r\nremarkable that two rare stones of such great weight, and such unusual\r\nform, should possess so great and so many degrees of resemblance. And\r\nit may be possible that the Mogul diamond is concealed in some of the\r\nobscure fastnesses of Persia, and may appear again to the world, like\r\nthe crown of Chosroes, after a thousand years of concealment.\r\n\r\nThe Orloff disputes with the Regent the claim of being the finest\r\nknown gem in the universe. Both have their ardent admirers. The Regent\r\nowes much of its fancied superiority to the regularity and perfection\r\nof its form, which is that of a perfect brilliant, and may therefore\r\nbe regarded as the type of the style. The Orloff, likewise, may be\r\nselected as the perfected model of the form known as the rose-cut.\r\nTherefore, either gem may be considered as the perfection of the\r\nbrilliant or the rose-style of cutting. The brilliant is certainly\r\nthe most symmetrical of all the forms; but does it enable the gem to\r\nexhibit to a full degree its powers of refraction? It may exhibit\r\nthe prismatic play of color in greater perfection; but does not the\r\nrose-cut project brighter beams of light in a more extensive proportion\r\nthan the brilliant? Let the opticians decide.\r\n\r\nThe Orloff now adorns the Russian sceptre, being placed in the top,\r\njust under the golden eagle.\r\n\r\nConcerning the history of the Orloff there is considerable obscurity,\r\neven in that which relates to the time and the manner in which it came\r\ninto possession of the Russians. At all events, there is no doubt but\r\nit formed a part of the spoils of Delhi, and was brought to Persia,\r\nalong with the Koh-i-noor and other gems, by the conqueror, Nadir Shah.\r\nIts subsequent history, however, is somewhat mixed up with other gems.\r\nDutens relates a romantic story of its having formed one of the eyes\r\nof the great idol at Seringapatam, and having been stolen by a French\r\ndeserter, who managed to be installed as a priest and attached to the\r\ntemple. Pallas, however, gives a totally different version, which he\r\nis said to have derived from the son of the Armenian who sold the gem\r\nto the Russians. This Armenian purchased the diamond from one of the\r\nAfghan generals, who formerly served with Nadir, and who received it as\r\nhis share of the booty. But so far as we can learn, the gem was brought\r\nto Europe by the Earl of Effingham, who obtained it when Governor\r\nGeneral of India. It frequently changed owners before it fell into the\r\npossession of the Greek merchant who took it to St. Petersburg and sold\r\nit to Prince Orloff. The price said to have been paid for it is given\r\nat $450,000, besides an annuity of $20,000 and a patent of nobility.\r\n\r\nThe Shah is a remarkably irregular prism of slab of diamond, partially\r\nfaceted by art. Tradition has associated with it adventures of a\r\nstartling and bloody character.\r\n\r\nIt was one of the gems possessed by Nadir Shah, and at the time of his\r\ndeath was received as booty and secreted by one of the assassins. Long\r\nafter the event, an Afghan visited an Armenian by the name of Shafras,\r\nwho lived at Bassora with his two brothers, and offered him a large\r\ndiamond, an emerald, a ruby of fabulous size, a sapphire of wonderful\r\nbeauty, together with a hundred other stones of less value. The\r\nstranger asked an insignificant price for these valuable gems, but the\r\nArmenian was not at the time able to furnish the means of purchase, and\r\nentreated the Afghan to return at another time with his treasures. But\r\nsuspicious of the good faith of the jeweller, the mountaineer departed\r\nand disappeared. Several years afterward the Armenian met, by chance,\r\nthe Afghan at Bagdad, where the gems were sold to a Jew for 65,000\r\npiastres. Shafras summoned his two brothers, and they assassinated\r\nthe stranger and the Jew, and flung their bodies into the Euphrates.\r\nThe brothers fled to the desert, and while attempting to divide their\r\nspoils fell into dispute. In the depths of night the elder brother slew\r\nhis two companions in crime, and fled to Constantinople. From thence\r\nhe passed to Holland, and informed several of the Courts of Europe\r\nof his treasures. Catherine is said to have invited him to Russia,\r\nbut would not accede to his terms of purchase. The Armenian, while at\r\nSt. Petersburg, was induced by some of the courtiers to lead a life\r\nof dissipation, with the view of ultimately obtaining his treasures.\r\nBut, soon perceiving the intentions of his associates, he secretly\r\nquitted the country, and was heard of no more for ten years, when by\r\naccident it was discovered that he was living quietly at Astrakhan. New\r\novertures were at once made to him by the Russians, but he would not\r\nconsent to meet the negotiators, except at Smyrna. At this city the\r\npurchase was finally made, and the Shah passed into the possession of\r\nthe Muscovites for an immense sum of money,--said to be $650,000.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately for this romantic story, only the outlines of which we\r\nhave here given, it is now reported that Chosroes, the son of Abbas\r\nMirza, presented the gem to the Emperor of Russia. Another account\r\nstates that it was purchased of Chosroes by the Russian Government. At\r\nall events, no matter what its true history may be since the death of\r\nNadir, it is a gem of the most perfect purity of color and freedom from\r\nblemish. Upon one of its sides an inscription in the Persian language\r\nhas been engraved by some lapidary of extraordinary patience. Its\r\nweight is ninety-five karats.\r\n\r\nMany of the Russian nobles possess fine diamonds, which are not well\r\nknown to the public. We know that the Princess Yassopouff owns the fine\r\nbrilliant of forty karats called the Polar Star; but what has become of\r\nthe fine gem of ninety karats, which was cut for Russia by the French\r\nlapidary Jarlet, at the close of the seventeenth century?\r\n\r\nWhile we are speaking of lost gems, we will call the attention of\r\nthe reader to the large pear-shaped diamond of 157¹⁄₄ karats, which\r\nTavernier bought at Amadabad in India, and brought to Europe on his\r\nreturn. This gem also has disappeared from history, and thus far evaded\r\nall attempts for its recovery. The history of all the large and famous\r\ndiamonds brought to Europe would form a most interesting chapter, if\r\nsome tireless antiquary could be induced to take up the subject and\r\nclear away the obscure wanderings of some of them.\r\n\r\nThe history of Potemkin, as related by a recent writer, reveals an\r\nextravagance unequalled since the days of the Roman follies; and it\r\nreads in these sober times more like romance than reality. The Prince,\r\nwhen fully attired, wore a collar of the Order of Saint Alexander,\r\nwhich was the gift of the Empress, and profusely ornamented with\r\ndiamonds of the value of 60,000 roubles. A laurel wreath, which he wore\r\non state occasions, also the gift of Catherine, was beautifully wrought\r\nin gold, and set with superb emeralds and diamonds which were estimated\r\nas worth 150,000 roubles.\r\n\r\nThe picture presented by this bold favorite in his sunniest days,\r\nwhen, for instance, he assisted the Empress to alight from her\r\ncarriage, surpasses the display of Prince Esterhazy in later times.\r\nOrloff was then dressed in a scarlet coat, over which hung a long cloak\r\nof gold lace extravagantly ornamented with precious stones of enormous\r\nvalue. In fact, his dress was completely covered with beautiful\r\ngems; and his hat was so heavily laden with precious stones, that an\r\n_aide-de-camp_ carried it for him when not in use.\r\n\r\nCatherine was not only passionately fond of belles-lettres and the\r\narts, but she had a generous heart withal, as evinced by the numerous\r\ngifts she bestowed upon her friends. The value of the gems and the\r\njewels she gave to her favorites exceeds almost the bounds of belief,\r\nand far surpasses the munificence of any of the sovereigns of history.\r\nThe total estimate of the worth of these gifts amounts to the enormous\r\nsum of 88,820,000 roubles. We will enumerate some of them. To Zoritz\r\nshe gave diamonds of the value of 200,000 roubles. To Plato Zouboff,\r\ngems worth 100,000 roubles. To Zawadoffsky, to Lanskoi, to Zermoloff,\r\nshe presented caskets of diamonds of the value of 80,000 roubles each.\r\nWasulitschikoff and Kozzakoff each received presents of the same\r\nprecious stone, costing 60,000 and 50,000 roubles. The five brothers of\r\nthe Orloff family, and especially Potemkin, received gifts amounting in\r\nvalue to many millions of roubles. To the famous house of Bariatinsky\r\nCatherine gave many beautiful gems which are still preserved among the\r\ntreasures of the family. Among them is a splendid solitaire diamond\r\nwith a pendant, which was given to one of the Princes at his baptism.\r\n\r\nSome of these jewels are of unique patterns and workmanship, and of\r\nimmense value. Among them is a necklace of solitaires, each stone\r\nas large as the end of the thumb, with large pear-shaped pendants\r\nattached. There is also a bracelet of rude Persian art, made of beaten\r\ngold, and set with uncut crystals of diamonds, thus indicating a very\r\nancient origin, or singular caprice on the part of the maker.\r\n\r\nThere are still preserved among the princely families of Russia, as\r\nwell as in the Royal casket, many diamonds yet in their rough and\r\ncrystallized forms, or imperfectly cut in the Oriental and ancient\r\nmanner.\r\n\r\nThe remarkable soldier, Suvaroff, although careless of his dress and\r\nhis personal appearance, was passionately fond of jewels. And the\r\nallied sovereigns of Europe, learning of his love of the beautiful,\r\nsent him several superb gems, among which was a large diamond of great\r\nbeauty, from the Empress Catherine.\r\n\r\nLike Charles _le Temeraire_, the terrible Cossack carried his gem\r\ntreasures with him during his campaigns; and he took infinite delight\r\nin examining their charms, in times of danger and fatigue. They were of\r\nvarious kinds and of great value; but the one he prized the most was\r\nthe gift of the Czarina. This splendid gem he always reserved for the\r\nlast look, after toying with the others; and seemed fascinated with the\r\nstrange gleams of the prismatic display, as the stone was viewed in the\r\ndim and flickering light of the camp-fire.\r\n\r\nWhat a picture is presented of the grim and fearless veteran, deriving\r\na gleam of comfort from his treasures during that lonely bivouac on the\r\nsummit of the high Alps, in Switzerland, on that fearful night in 1799,\r\nwhen the victorious French, under Lecourbe, forced the Tatar general,\r\nwith his twenty-four thousand desperate soldiers, and with terrible\r\nlosses, over the desolate and rarely trodden pass of the Kenzig Culm!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\n                            FRENCH REGALIA.\r\n\r\n\r\nPrevious to the time of the French Revolution, and commencing from\r\nperiods dating back beyond mediæval days, France had accumulated a\r\ncasket of gems and jewels of extraordinary richness and value. The\r\namateur may form an idea of their beauty and magnificence, from the\r\nfamous report made to the French Assembly by M. Delattre in 1791. In\r\nthis list there were enumerated with special care, 9,547 diamonds, 506\r\npearls, 230 rubies, 134 sapphires, 150 emeralds, 71 topazes, 3 Oriental\r\namethysts, 8 Syrian garnets, and 8 other stones not designated.\r\n\r\nThe estimated value of these treasures, together with the bijou and\r\nmounted parures belonging to the Crown, amounted to nearly thirty\r\nmillion francs. From this carefully arranged inventory, we have made\r\nthe following selection, which will be interesting to the reader at the\r\npresent day, as not only showing the estimated worth of the gems at\r\nthat time, but also describing some of the fine gems whose history has\r\nsince been lost.\r\n\r\n +-----------------------------------------------+----------+----------+\r\n |

collection was mysteriously stolen in\r\nSeptember, 1792, and many of the fine gems have not been recovered.\r\nNeither has time yet divulged the authors of this bold theft, nor\r\nexplained clearly the motives that led to the act. The circumstances\r\nconnected with this celebrated robbery are interesting although\r\nobscure. They are as follows:--\r\n\r\nAfter the fearful and bloody scenes of the 10th of August and the\r\n2d of September, fears were entertained by the Republican chiefs\r\nconcerning the safety of the public treasures. Therefore the building\r\nwhich contained the gems was closed to the public; and the Commune of\r\nParis, representing the domain of the State, placed its seals upon\r\nthe apartments wherein were placed the crown, sceptre, the golden\r\nwreath left by Cardinal Richelieu to Louis XIII., and a great number\r\nof gems and bijou. On the morning of the 17th of September M. Sergent\r\nand two other Commissioners of the Police perceived that during the\r\nnight thieves had entered the halls of the Garde Meuble by scaling the\r\ncolonnade from the side of the Place Louis XV., and opening the windows\r\non that side. They had broken the seals, picked the locks, and, after\r\nremoving many of the inestimable treasures, had disappeared, without\r\nleaving a trace of their flight.\r\n\r\nThe city was thrown into consternation at the boldness of the act\r\nand the magnitude of the robbery. Active and untiring search was at\r\nonce made, but not a trace of the plunder nor the least clew to the\r\nperpetrators could be obtained.\r\n\r\nNot long after, however, an anonymous letter revealed the information\r\nthat a part of the spoil was then secreted in a ditch beside one of the\r\nalleys of the Champs d’Elysées. Sergent, with his colleagues, hastened\r\nto the spot indicated, and found there the Regent diamond and the\r\nmagnificent agate cup then known as the Chalice of Abbé Suger.\r\n\r\nSearch was thus stimulated to further exertions, but without avail and\r\ntwelve years passed without affording the least clew to the robbers. At\r\nthis time a forgery was committed upon the Bank of France, and several\r\npersons were arrested for the act. Among them was a veteran soldier who\r\nhad formerly served in the Pandours, and who was called by his comrades\r\n“Baba.”\r\n\r\nWhen arraigned before the court, Baba made the following singular\r\nconfession after betraying his accomplices in the forgery: “This is\r\nnot the first time,” he exclaimed in an excited manner, “that my\r\nconfessions have been useful to society; and if you condemn me I shall\r\nimplore the clemency of the Emperor. Without me Napoleon would not\r\nbe on the throne, for it is to me alone the success of the battle of\r\nMarengo is due. I was one of the robbers of the Garde Meuble. I aided\r\nmy accomplices to bury in the ditch in the Champs d’Elysées the Regent\r\nand the other objects which, being easily recognized, would have led\r\nto detection. Upon the consideration of a promise which has been\r\nperfectly kept, I revealed this hiding-place. The Regent was found;\r\nand, gentlemen of the court, you are not ignorant of the fact that the\r\nmagnificent diamond was placed in the hands of the Dutch by the First\r\nConsul to procure the funds which were so much needed after the 18th\r\nBrumaire.”\r\n\r\nBaba was nevertheless condemned to the galleys, but the sentence was\r\nnot enforced, and shortly afterwards he was sent to the prison in the\r\nBicêtre, where he remained until he died. Nothing further than this was\r\never made known publicly, but suspicions of complicity in the robbery\r\nwere directed towards the Orleans family.\r\n\r\nNapoleon, when crowned as Emperor, and with the wealth of Europe at\r\nhis command, made great efforts to restore the National regalia to\r\ntheir former beauty and value. The various countries of Europe were\r\nransacked for the lost gems; and it is stated that a number of them\r\nwere recovered. Great numbers of other gems were also bought and added\r\nto the Regalia; so that in 1810 the inventory of the Crown exhibited a\r\nlist of 37,393 precious stones.\r\n\r\nThe changes of the one hundred days and the Restoration left the\r\nNational property untouched. Under the reigns of Louis XVIII. and\r\nCharles X. additions were made, and the casket contained 64,812 gems\r\nand precious stones of all kinds. The inventory of 1849 presented\r\nthe same number of articles, with a total valuation of over twenty\r\nmillions of francs, without estimating the value of the bijou.\r\n\r\nThere must have been a large augmentation during this time, for the\r\npresent which Louis XVIII. ordered to be made deducted from the\r\ncollection diamonds of the value of three quarters of a million of\r\nfrancs. This costly present was in the form of the Order of Saint\r\nEsprit and constructed of superb diamonds.\r\n\r\nOf the robbery of 1792, the Sancy diamond and the unique blue one of\r\nsixty-seven karats have never been recovered. Since the inventory of\r\n1810 two beautiful gems have also disappeared. One of these was the\r\nmagnificent opal which Josephine wore, and which was known as the\r\nBurning of Troy. The other was the beautiful brilliant of thirty-four\r\nkarats which was obtained by M. Elias for Napoleon. This was the\r\nmuch-loved gem which the Emperor is said to have carried with him on\r\nhis person, and which was asserted to have been lost in the rout at\r\nWaterloo.\r\n\r\nThe magnificent blue diamond, which was regarded as one of the marvels\r\nof the mineral kingdom, has never been recovered. Its early history\r\nhas also been lost, but the gem is believed to be the identical stone\r\nwhich Tavernier brought from India and sold to Louis XIV. At that time\r\nit was described as a gem of a beautiful violet hue, but of a bad form,\r\nbeing flat and thin. Its weight in this condition was 112³⁄₁₆ karats,\r\nwhich would probably afford a fine brilliant of the size of the missing\r\nstone, 67²⁄₁₆ karats. History has failed to trace the wanderings of\r\nthis gem since its departure from the Louvre, but suspicion rests upon\r\nthe superb blue diamond which was in the possession of the English\r\nbanker, the late Mr. Hope. However, the English diamond weighs but\r\n44¹⁄₂ karats. Therefore a loss of quite 22 karats was incurred in\r\nrecutting the stone in order to escape detection.\r\n\r\nThe Regent diamond, which was found uninjured in the ditch of the\r\nChamps d’Elysées, is in reality the most beautiful diamond yet known\r\nin the world. It is not the largest, but it is the most perfect of all\r\nthe paragons, being almost faultless in its transparency and purity, as\r\nwell as in its exact and symmetrical form.\r\n\r\nIt derives its name from the fact that it was purchased and added to\r\nthe French casket by the Regent of France. This magnificent gem was\r\nfound in the diamond mines of Puteal, about one hundred and thirty-five\r\nmiles from the city of Golconda. It weighed in its natural condition\r\nfour hundred and ten karats, but during the process of cutting it\r\nwas reduced to 136¹⁴⁄₁₆ karats. A Parsee merchant by the name of\r\nJamcund, who was a famous collector of diamonds, obtained possession\r\nof the stone and brought it to Madras, where he sold it to the English\r\nGovernor, William Pitt, for $60,000. Pitt brought the stone safely\r\nto London, and, after having had it cut, offered it for sale. The\r\nRoyal House of England declined to invest in the gem; but after long\r\nnegotiations the Duke of Orleans, Regent of France during the minority\r\nof Louis XV., purchased it in 1717 for the sum of 3,375,000 francs.\r\nSeventy-four years afterwards a commission of experts reckoned its\r\nvalue at 12,000,000 francs, and even this enormous sum is exceeded by\r\nthe valuation of the present day.\r\n\r\nNapoleon, after establishing his fortunes, redeemed the Regent from\r\nthe Dutch bankers, and had it set in the handle of the sword of state.\r\nSince then it has been removed and so arranged in its setting as to be\r\nplaced at will either in the crown or used separately.\r\n\r\nTo the historian this beautiful gem is singularly interesting, for\r\nit has indirectly exercised a mighty influence upon the destinies of\r\nEurope and the progress of civilization. It was of infinite aid to\r\nNapoleon after the 18th Brumaire; and probably without the help of\r\nthe little glittering pebble as a collateral for the Dutch loan, the\r\ndecisive battle of Marengo never would have been fought. And it is no\r\nless certain that William Pitt, England’s Premier, never would have\r\nbeen the leading statesman of Europe had not his grandfather acquired\r\nthe diamond in India and established the prosperity of his family by\r\nits sale. Pitt was the master of European politics; and even after\r\nhis life was crushed out by the defeat at Austerlitz, the heritage of\r\nhis genius and his hate was apparent in every coalition, every blow,\r\nagainst Napoleon that finally culminated at Waterloo. Therefore, in\r\nreviewing the history of the Regent diamond, the philosopher might be\r\ntempted to say that it was to the same gem, by a singular fatality or\r\ncaprice of fortune, the “Great Captain” indirectly owed his success and\r\nhis downfall.\r\n\r\nThe jewels belonging to the Crown of France, as collected and restored\r\nby Napoleon, and increased by the good taste of the succeeding rulers\r\nof the country, are of great beauty and value. It is, indeed, one of\r\nthe finest collections of Europe. The casket, at the present time,\r\ncontains sixty perfect diamonds, varying in weight from 25 to 28\r\nkarats, besides the splendid and matchless Regent. The actual crown\r\ndisplays eight great diamonds of the purest water, weighing from 19 to\r\n28 karats each, besides the Regent, which may be adapted at will.\r\n\r\nDuring the Universal Exposition at Paris, in 1855, the jewels of the\r\nCrown were displayed to the public. Many of the gems were mounted for\r\nthe occasion in new parures; and the arrangement presented one of the\r\nmost charming exhibitions ever seen in civilized countries.\r\n\r\nWe will now turn to the history of one of the lost diamonds of the\r\nCrown, and relate the facts and hypotheses concerning it as fully as we\r\nhave been able to collect them. They form, indeed, a perplexing theme.\r\n\r\nThe beautiful diamond inventoried as the Sancy, and of the weight\r\nof 33¹²⁄₁₆ karats and valued at 1,000,000 francs, was also stolen\r\nand never recovered. This gem has been associated with the fortunes\r\nof the redoubtable Burgundian warrior, Charles the Bold; and its\r\nhistory has done more to perpetuate his name than the record of all\r\nhis misdeeds and his desperate battles. To prove, however, that this\r\nis the identical gem lost to the Swiss will be a difficult task; for\r\nthe antiquaries have unearthed more Sancy diamonds than there were\r\n“Richmonds in the field.” The name of Sancy has, indeed, become famous\r\nby embracing in one story the fortunes of three distinct gems.\r\n\r\nThe erudite King has patiently traced out the traditions connected with\r\nthe name of Sancy, and appears to prove that three stories instead of\r\none are included in the history of Baron Sancy. But the stone that was\r\nstolen from the French casket in 1792 is inventoried at the weight of\r\n33¹²⁄₁₆ karats, while the gem that has lately gone back to India, and\r\nis supposed to be the stolen gem, weighs quite 54 karats. Here is a\r\nnew mystery for the antiquaries to clear away; or did Delattre and his\r\nassociates, who made out this inventory with exceeding care, write 33\r\ninstead of 53?\r\n\r\nThe histories of these diamonds are so interesting that we will attempt\r\nto repeat them here, following, in part, the views of Mr. King. Not\r\nlong after the invention, by Berquen, of diamond-cutting by the process\r\nof abrasion, Charles the Bold, then in the full blaze of martial glory,\r\nsubmitted to him three large rough diamonds. The native of Bruges\r\nsucceeded so well in polishing them, that Charles presented him with\r\nthe princely sum of 3,000 ducats.\r\n\r\nOne of these gems Charles gave to Pope Sextus IV., and it was mounted\r\nin the Tiara, where it is said to remain. The second was presented to\r\nLouis XI. of France; while the third was reserved by the Burgundian\r\nhero, and set in a grotesque manner to be worn as a personal ornament.\r\n\r\nThis jewel, of true barbaric design, was formed of a triangular shape,\r\nwith the newly cut diamond in the centre. This diamond was ⁵⁄₈ of an\r\ninch in its widest diameter, and was shaped as a pyramid, with the apex\r\ncut into a four-rayed star in relief. Around the gem were set three\r\nlarge Balais rubies and four magnificent pearls, each more than half an\r\ninch in diameter.\r\n\r\nOne of the Fugger family, in 1555, made a careful drawing of the jewel,\r\nwith a written description of it, and these were afterwards published\r\nby Lambeccius in his Bibliotheca Cæsarea; so there can be no doubt\r\nabout the appearance of the original diamond of Charles the Bold in its\r\nearly days.\r\n\r\nWhen the Duke led his band of freebooters into Switzerland on his\r\nlong-projected foray, he took most of his gems along with him, not\r\ndreaming of disaster, and probably loving to view his treasures even\r\namid the hardships of a campaign. Rough soldiers are sometimes as\r\nfond of the beautiful in art and nature as more delicate and refined\r\norganizations; and Charles the Bold and Suvaroff are not the only\r\nexamples.\r\n\r\nThe terrific onslaught of the Swiss at Grandson crushed the Burgundian\r\nranks so quickly that Charles had only time to escape with his sword,\r\nleaving all his cherished treasures in the hands of the dauntless\r\nmountaineers.\r\n\r\nIn the sack of the camp which speedily followed the rout, a soldier\r\nfound the golden box in which the famous pendant was kept, but\r\nregarding the jewel as a gaudy and worthless bauble, he tossed it away\r\nunder a wagon, and retained the box only. Shortly afterwards he began\r\nto suspect that the contents of so beautiful a box must have some\r\nrelative value, and returning to the place he recovered the despised\r\njewel. He did not long retain his treasure, but sold it to a priest\r\nfor one florin. The priest also did not appear to have a high regard\r\nfor his purchase, for he disposed of it to the magistrates of his own\r\ncanton for three francs.\r\n\r\nWhen it became known that the Bernese Government had possession of\r\nthe Duke’s famous jewels, Jacob Fugger, one of the members of the\r\ncelebrated Nuremberg family, went to Bern and negotiated for their\r\npurchase. The famous pendant, together with the Duke’s cap, which was\r\nmade of silk covered with pearls and Balais rubies, and a plume case\r\nset with diamonds, pearls, and Balais rubies, were bought for the sum\r\nof 47,000 francs. Fugger retained the pendant in his possession at\r\nNuremberg for many years, indulging in the hope, it has been said, that\r\nthe Duke’s great-grandson, the Emperor Charles V., would purchase it\r\nas a family relic. When the celebrated capitalist died the ornament was\r\nstill in his possession; but his great-nephew, who inherited the jewel,\r\nsold it to Henry VIII. of England. After the death of this monarch,\r\nhis daughter presented the diamond to her bridegroom; and thus, by a\r\nremarkable coincidence, and after an absence of seventy-six years, the\r\nroyal gem is again restored to the rightful heir of its original owner.\r\nSo far the history of Sancy No. 1 can be clearly traced.\r\n\r\nNow for the stories relating to the Sancy diamond No. 2. But, before\r\nproceeding further in this interesting and misty search, we will\r\nexplain the history of the nobleman who has inseparably connected his\r\nname with so many gems.\r\n\r\nNicolas Harlai, Seigneur de Sancy, was of French descent, and the\r\ntreasurer and intimate friend of King Henry IV. He had filled several\r\npositions of high responsibility, and served as ambassador to several\r\nof the Courts of Europe. He was also known as a man of culture, a lover\r\nof the fine arts, and an amateur in gems.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1589, Baron Sancy is said to have obtained a large diamond\r\nfrom the Pretender to the Crown of Portugal, as security for a loan\r\nof one hundred thousand livres. The antiquaries have thus far failed\r\nto ascertain whence this gem was obtained; but it cannot be supposed\r\nthat it was the identical jewel Philip II. of Spain had received from\r\nthe English Princess, for the Spaniard was then the bitterest foe of\r\nDon Antonio. Furthermore, Philip, when dying, in 1598, ten years later\r\nthan the above-mentioned period, gave to the Infanta a diamond of great\r\nbeauty saying that it once belonged to Queen Mary of England. At all\r\nevents, it is quite certain that the French Baron had in his hands a\r\nlarge and valuable diamond.\r\n\r\nNot long after this acquisition, Henry IV. wished to engage the\r\nservices of a select body of Swiss soldiers, to serve in his army; and\r\nas security for the pay of these hirelings, he sent the gem by a trusty\r\nservant to Harlai, who was then in Switzerland. The faithful valet,\r\nwhilst on his way to Bern, was beset by robbers in the forests that\r\nconceal the entrance to the pass of the Dôle, one of the mountains of\r\nthe Jura. He managed to swallow the diamond without being perceived by\r\nthe bandits, before he was stripped and assassinated.\r\n\r\nThe Baron, on learning the fate of his envoy, mistrusted that he had\r\nresorted to this expedient of concealing his treasure. He therefore\r\nsent a party of soldiers to the place, disinterred the body, and\r\nrecovered the gem. It was immediately placed in the hands of the Jews\r\nof Metz, as security for a large sum of money; and it is also related\r\nthat the gem was never redeemed. Here ends the history of the second\r\nSancy; and no further account of it can be found.\r\n\r\nConcerning the history of Sancy No. 3, it is related that when Baron\r\nSancy returned from Constantinople, where he had been as ambassador,\r\nhe exhibited a large and beautiful diamond, which he had acquired for\r\nthe sum of $120,000. This statement is somewhat obscure, from the fact\r\nthat the ambassador was not Harlai de Sancy, but his son Achille, who\r\nwas also sent on various missions by Richelieu during the years 1626\r\nto 1635. However, it is certain that a new diamond was imported into\r\nFrance by one of the Sancys, and that it was a remarkable gem. It was\r\ndescribed as being of the form of an almond, faceted all over its\r\nsurface with small facets, after the manner practised in India. The\r\nweight of this gem has been variously stated; and these conflicting\r\nstatements have served to increase the mystery concerning the Sancy\r\ngems. The weight of the diamond has been given as high as one hundred\r\nand twenty-six karats; but Delisle assured Dutens that he saw M.\r\nJacquemin, the Crown jeweller, weigh the gem, and that it did not\r\nexceed fifty-four karats. Nevertheless, the famous inventory of the\r\nFrench gems in 1792 gives 33¹²⁄₁₆ karats as the true weight of the\r\nfamous Sancy diamond. How shall we explain this wide discrepancy?\r\n\r\nForty-two years after the death of the Baron, the diamond passed\r\ninto the hands of Henrietta Maria, the queen-dowager of England, and\r\nsubsequently into the possession of James II. The unfortunate king,\r\nwhile in exile, sold the gem to Louis IV. for the sum of $125,000; and\r\nhere its history ends.\r\n\r\nDuring the latter part of the seventeenth century, Robert de Berquen,\r\na descendant of the famous lapidary, wrote his “Merveilles des Indes,”\r\nand therein he describes the diamond brought from India by Baron Sancy,\r\nas then in possession of the Queen of England, and being almond-like\r\nin form, faceted on both sides, and of fifty-four karats in weight.\r\nThis account agrees with those of the French jewellers, and serves to\r\nconnect the history of the gem up to this period.\r\n\r\nNot many years after the bold robbery of 1792, a large diamond was\r\nacquired, by some mysterious means, by the widow of Charles IV. of\r\nSpain, who gave it to the notorious Prince of Peace Godoy. In 1838,\r\nPrincess Paul Demidoff is said to have purchased it for half a million\r\nof roubles; and it is also certain that the Demidoff family sold it in\r\n1865, to the Parsee millionnaire, Sir Jansetjee Jejeebhoy of Bombay,\r\nfor $100,000.\r\n\r\nNow the question arises, which was the true Sancy? And to settle the\r\ninquiry satisfactorily, will be a difficult task. From all these\r\naccounts, the reader may infer that there are three distinct diamonds\r\nincluded under the history of Sancy. The first is the diamond of the\r\nDuke of Burgundy, weighing, from its description, about thirty-three\r\nkarats, and of a well-marked form. This gem is clearly traced to Philip\r\nII. of Spain. The second, which was of unknown weight, was last noticed\r\nin the hands of the Jews at Metz. The third was of the form of a\r\nbrilliolette, and of fifty-four karats weight, and has lately returned\r\nto the land of its birth, with the honors of the name of Sancy. Which\r\nof these gems deserves the name of the Sancy diamond?\r\n\r\nMadame de Pompadour, in the bright days of her prosperity, possessed\r\nsome rare gems, but we can learn but little concerning them. Her will\r\nindicates that the beautiful ring containing white and rose-colored\r\ndiamonds was given to the Duke de Goutaud, and also that the rare\r\ndiamond of an aqua marine tint went to the Duke de Choiseul.\r\n\r\nAfter having referred to the political importance of the Regent\r\ndiamond, it may be proper for us to briefly mention the famous affair\r\nof the diamond necklace, which unjustly cast a stain upon the prestige\r\nof royalty in France, and ultimately exerted a certain influence, among\r\nother causes, that led to the downfall of the monarchy, and the fearful\r\nscenes that followed. The details of this daring scheme read more like\r\nromance than reality; yet they are well substantiated in history.\r\n\r\nIt appears that Böhmer, a jeweller of Paris, had collected, in 1784, a\r\nlarge number of beautiful diamonds, with which he formed a magnificent\r\nnecklace valued at 1,600,000 francs. The jewel had been offered to the\r\nQueen Marie Antoinette; but she had declined the purchase as beyond her\r\nmeans at the time. Her regrets at her inability to obtain the splendid\r\ndecoration reached the ears of Prince Cardinal de Rohan, who was then\r\nliving at Paris, in disgrace, for having divulged some court secrets\r\nwhile he was ambassador at Vienna. The Prince was not only handsome\r\nand conceited, but he was notorious for his gallantry and his follies.\r\nUnfortunately for himself and the court, he sought at this time to\r\nregain the favor of the Queen, and made it the grand object of his life.\r\n\r\nHe had among his intimate acquaintances a bold, dashing woman by the\r\nname of Madame de la Motte, who pretended to be a countess of the\r\nfamily of Valois. She had married a man by the name of La Motte, who\r\nwas intimate with the notorious quacks Villette and Cagliostro, who\r\nwere then in the zenith of their fame. The Countess was well known\r\nin Paris as a woman of immorality and deeply versed in the arts of\r\nintrigue.\r\n\r\nShe became acquainted with the facts of the Queen’s admiration for the\r\nnecklace and the infatuation of Rohan for the Queen; and upon these\r\nshe arranged her scheme for duping the Prince and obtaining possession\r\nof the property. She soon won the confidence of Rohan, and represented\r\nto him the Queen’s intense longing for the necklace, and the favor he\r\nwould gain in loaning the means which would enable her to obtain the\r\ncoveted jewel and pay for it at her leisure. She promised, furthermore,\r\nthrough the aid of Cagliostro, to obtain an interview with the Queen on\r\nthis subject. The promised interview took place one night in August,\r\n1784, in the garden of Versailles; but the Queen was represented by a\r\nlow character by the name of D’Oliva, who was almost a counterpart of\r\nMarie Antoinette.\r\n\r\nRohan was completely deceived, and agreed to purchase the necklace;\r\nwhich he did not long after, giving his notes for half-yearly payments,\r\nand receiving as security a bond from the pretended Queen, which,\r\nhowever, was forged by La Motte’s husband. The Prince Cardinal then\r\nintrusted the jewel to the Countess for conveyance to the Queen;\r\nbut she passed it over to her husband, who lost no time in hurrying\r\nto London, where he immediately converted its gems into money. The\r\nCountess, however, did not hasten to join her husband, but remained at\r\nParis, rejoicing in her audacity and good fortune, and with the hope of\r\nplucking more feathers from her princely victim. Nearly a year passed\r\naway before the secret was discovered.\r\n\r\nBöhmer, anxious for his pay, approached the King; and the fraud was\r\nat once discovered. The Cardinal Prince was arrested just as he was\r\nabout to perform mass before the court, and sent to the Bastile.\r\nAfter a short imprisonment, he was tried by a court of justice, but\r\nacquitted of criminal offence. However, he was sent in disgrace to\r\nreside at an abbey of his in Auvergne. Madame la Motte paid dearly for\r\nher crime and her dalliance in Paris after the prize had been secured,\r\nfor she was sentenced to be branded on the shoulders, scourged in\r\npublic, and condemned to perpetual imprisonment. She bore her trials\r\nwith fortitude, and had the good fortune to escape from her prison\r\nin less than a year after her sentence. She joined her husband in\r\nLondon, and there published a bitter pamphlet against the French Court,\r\nand especially the Queen. It is generally supposed that the Countess\r\ndied in London in 1791, either from a fever or the result of an\r\naccident caused by a drunken debauch. But a startling story comes from\r\nRussia, giving another account of the last moments of this celebrated\r\nadventuress.\r\n\r\nIt appears that the Emperor Alexander, disgusted with the conduct\r\nof three lady reformers who attempted to establish a revolution in\r\nreligious opinion at St. Petersburg, banished them to the Crimea. They\r\nwere Princess Galitzin, Madame de Krudener, and a mysterious personage\r\nwho went by the name of Countess Gauchin. After death, which occurred\r\nduring her banishment to the Crimea, the strange Countess proved to\r\nbe the notorious De la Motte, who many years before had been publicly\r\nbranded on the Place de la Grève in Paris.\r\n\r\nIt would appear from statements in mediæval history that necklaces were\r\nnot much known in France, or at least were not in fashion, until the\r\ntimes of Charles VIII. For one of the earliest known in that country\r\nwas that given by the above-named monarch to the beautiful Agnes\r\nSorel. The uncut gems, which were of great beauty and value, weighed\r\nheavily upon the delicate neck and bosom of the fair creature; and she\r\ncomplained of it to her lover as being an instrument of torture as well\r\nas a decoration. The King, fascinated with the charming effect of the\r\ngems, together with the natural entrancing beauty of the maiden, begged\r\nher to wear it, saying, with a supplicating smile, “One might surely\r\nbear some little inconvenience to please those we love.”\r\n\r\nThe late Madame Thiers possessed a rare jewel, which came to her by\r\ninheritance, and which she wisely bequeathed to the Louvre collection.\r\nThis jewel is a necklace of precious stones of the sixteenth century\r\nworkmanship, and is regarded as without a rival in Europe except among\r\nthe regalia preserved at St. Petersburg.\r\n\r\nThere are a great many diamonds owned in France among the nobility, the\r\nlanded proprietors, and the successful merchants. Paris has been for a\r\nlong time the chief market in the world for the sale of the gem; and\r\nmost of the stones cut at Amsterdam find their way, primarily, to the\r\nParisian bazaars. Many of these are taken as securities by the rich;\r\nbut the most of them are absorbed by the requirements of fashion and\r\nthe love of display.\r\n\r\nAdventurers, during the tide of success, prefer to invest their gains\r\nin gems, and especially diamonds, rather than in lands or bonds. There\r\nis a twofold reason for this preference. Great wealth can be concealed\r\nin a handful of gems which can be easily transported; and the glitter\r\nof the stones adds vastly to the fascinations of the investment.\r\nDisastrous wars and commercial panics generally betray hoards of this\r\ndescription; and new sources of the precious stones are thus opened to\r\ncommerce. It is reported that the Bonaparte family, since the disaster\r\nat Sedan, have thrown upon the market diamonds to the value of several\r\nmillions of dollars.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\n                THE REGALIA AND OTHER GEMS OF ENGLAND.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe casket of gems belonging to the English Crown is not of\r\nancient date, for the followers of Cromwell--iconoclasts and\r\neconomists--ordered all the ancient regalia to be sold. However, some\r\nof the finest of the gems were recovered not long after, and were used\r\nin the decorations of the coronation of Charles II.\r\n\r\nThe present crown of England was made by English artisans, in 1838,\r\nwith gems taken from old diadems and others bought by Victoria. It is\r\ndescribed by Professor Tennant as follows:--\r\n\r\n “The imperial state crown of Her Majesty, Queen Victoria, was made\r\n in the year 1838, by Messrs. Rundell and Bridge, with jewels taken\r\n from old crowns, and others furnished by command of Her Majesty. It\r\n consists of diamonds, pearls, rubies, sapphires, and emeralds, set in\r\n silver and gold; it has a crimson-velvet cap with ermine border, and\r\n is lined with white silk. Its gross weight is 39 oz. 5 dwts. Troy.\r\n\r\n “The lower part of the band above the ermine border consists of a\r\n row of 129 pearls; and the upper part of the band, of a row of 112\r\n pearls; between which, in the front of the crown, is a large sapphire\r\n [partly drilled] purchased for the crown by His Majesty, King George\r\n IV. At the back is a sapphire of smaller size and 6 other sapphires,\r\n 3 on each side, between which are 8 emeralds. Above and below the 7\r\n sapphires are 14 diamonds, and around the 8 emeralds 128 diamonds.\r\n Between the emeralds and sapphires are 16 trefoil ornaments containing\r\n 160 diamonds. Above the band are 8 sapphires surmounted by 8 diamonds,\r\n between which are 8 festoons, consisting of 148 diamonds. In the\r\n front of the crown, and in the centre of a diamond Maltese cross, is\r\n the famous ruby said to have been given to Edward, Prince of Wales,\r\n the Black Prince, by Don Pedro, King of Castile, after the battle of\r\n Najara, near Vittoria, A.D. 1367. This ruby was worn in the helmet of\r\n Henry V. at the battle of Agincourt, A.D. 1415. It is pierced quite\r\n through, after the Eastern custom, the upper part of the piercing\r\n being filled up by a small ruby. Around this ruby, to form the cross,\r\n are 75 brilliant-diamonds. Three other Maltese crosses, forming the\r\n two sides and back of the crown, have emerald centres, and contain\r\n respectively 132, 124, and 130 brilliant-diamonds. Between the 4\r\n Maltese crosses are 4 ornaments, in the form of French _fleurs de\r\n lis_, with 4 rubies in their centres, and surrounded by rose-diamonds,\r\n containing respectively, 84, 86, 86, 87 rose-diamonds. From the\r\n Maltese crosses issue 4 imperial arches composed of oak-leaves and\r\n acorns; the leaves containing 728 rose, table, and brilliant diamonds;\r\n 32 pearls forming the acorns, set in cups, containing 54 rose-diamonds\r\n and 1 table-diamond. The total number of diamonds in the arches and\r\n acorns is 108 brilliant, 116 table, and 559 rose diamonds. From the\r\n upper part of the arches are suspended 4 large pendent pear-shaped\r\n pearls with rose-diamond cups, containing 12 rose-diamonds, and\r\n stems, containing 24 very small rose-diamonds. Above the arch stands\r\n the Mound, containing in the lower hemisphere 304 brilliants, and\r\n in the upper 244 brilliants; the zone and arc being composed of 33\r\n rose-diamonds. The cross on the summit has a rose-cut sapphire in the\r\n centre, surrounded by 4 large brilliants and 108 smaller brilliants.”\r\n\r\nThe value of this beautiful ornament has been estimated by Barbot, the\r\nFrench jeweller, at the sum of $600,000, which, however, is probably\r\nvery far below its real value.\r\n\r\nThe great prize and boast of the English treasures is the diamond\r\ncalled the Koh-i-noor, one of the spoils of the East India loot.\r\n\r\nFrom the many descriptions given of it and its real and supposed\r\nhistory, it is better known to the English reader than any other\r\ngem; yet there are in Europe several diamonds of greater size and\r\nperfection, and a number of gems of greater beauty, and certainly of\r\na higher value. The Koh-i-noor is said to have been discovered in the\r\nmine of Gani, near Golconda, about the middle of the sixteenth century.\r\nIt is thought by some to be a portion of the Great Mogul diamond; but\r\nof the correctness of this view there is considerable doubt.\r\n\r\nThe form in which it was found by the English at the time of capture\r\ncertainly conveys the idea that it may have been cleft from a larger\r\nspecimen; but, according to Tavernier, the Great Mogul was ground down\r\nand not rifted by means of its cleavage planes at all. At all events,\r\nthe gem, when it reached England, weighed one hundred and eighty-six\r\nkarats, and its sides were polished and faceted in the Oriental\r\nmanner, without regard to a symmetrical form. In this condition it was\r\nuncouth, it is true, but it was supposed to be the famous Koh-i-noor,\r\n“the mountain of light,” of Eastern romance and history. Now, in its\r\nnew shape, it is no longer one of the giants of its species, and the\r\nprestige which the Hindoos bestowed upon it has also vanished. The\r\nrecutting of this gem, and the attempt to reduce its irregular form\r\ninto the shape of a brilliant, was most unfortunate. It is now only a\r\nbrilliant in name, and it is far too thin in substance to exhibit the\r\nbeautiful and natural refractive powers of the mineral.\r\n\r\nIn reality, the form of the brilliant should be cut according to\r\nmathematical laws; and its depth and breadth must be of a certain fixed\r\nratio to call forth the natural brilliancy and prismatic display of the\r\nstone. This relative degree of form and its wonderful results is well\r\nexemplified in the gems cut by Ralph Potter at the commencement of this\r\ncentury, who was, without doubt, the best diamond-cutter the world has\r\nseen. It is also laid down as a mathematical problem in the scale which\r\nJeffries has prepared.\r\n\r\nThe Koh-i-noor, before cutting, weighed one hundred and eighty-six\r\nkarats; and was the second diamond in Europe. It is now reduced\r\nto 102¹⁄₄ karats, with its splendors but little increased; and is\r\nreckoned as the fifth in size among the European diamonds; and, to\r\nour view, is inferior in value to many of the diamonds of less size,\r\nand especially the green diamond of Dresden, or the blue of the Hope\r\ncollection. In fact, it is far exceeded in beauty and splendor by the\r\nimitations of art. The prestige has been injured, if not destroyed, by\r\ncutting; and its position among the great gems of the world reduced to\r\na comparatively low degree, notwithstanding its great weight.\r\n\r\nNo amateur will say that the gem has gained any advantage in cutting,\r\nwhen he sums up the arguments in favor of and against the operation. He\r\nwill not say the Koh-i-noor, exhibited in the London exhibition, was\r\nsuperior in all respects to the time-honored gem displayed among the\r\ncrown jewels of the Tower of London a few years before. In reality,\r\nits appearance in the Crystal Palace was inferior to that of its glass\r\nmodels; and a comparison of its form with the examples offered by\r\nJeffries will at once show its imperfections.\r\n\r\nIn its spread, as compared with that of a properly proportioned\r\none-hundred-karat brilliant, it is quite one third too large; or, in\r\nplainer language, it is now a badly shaped stone, and cannot display\r\nits latent splendors unless surrounded by a great number of wax candles.\r\n\r\nA comparison with the outlines of the Regent will at once show the\r\nwant of harmony in its shape so far as development of brilliancy and\r\nprismatic display are concerned; and to obtain the display of these\r\nproperties, without which the diamond is not much better than common\r\nlimpid quartz, the form of the gem must be invariably of a certain\r\nsize and depth. A lustreless mass of diamond, no matter how large it\r\nmay be, is not a choice example of the mineral, in comparison with a\r\nsmaller stone, radiant with its natural, or rather developed, beauties.\r\nSize alone, without special excellence, brings no charm with it, but\r\nrather places it among mineralogical curiosities. Therefore, we regret\r\nexceedingly the recent cutting of the Koh-i-noor, which has injured its\r\nprestige, and reduced its value incomparably.\r\n\r\nHad the lapidaries adopted the form of the Sancy, that is, the shape\r\nof the almond, with small facets all over it, a far greater brilliancy\r\nwould have been obtained. Such is the opinion of Babinet and other\r\nconnoisseurs, who are able to judge on this subject. The Koh-i-noor,\r\nbefore cutting, was submitted by Prince Albert to the examination\r\nof several eminent men, amongst whom was Sir David Brewster; and a\r\nvariety of opinions were expressed upon the subject. It is generally\r\nbelieved that ideas of fashion directed the shape of the stone to\r\nbe adopted; and that if its form had been left to Coster, the model\r\nof the brilliolette would have been copied, and but little of the\r\nstone sacrificed in the cutting. However, it is too late to lament\r\nthe accident or the error; but we hope that the experience acquired\r\nwill preserve other specimens for the admiration of art, although it\r\navailed nought in the case of the Star of the South, another stone\r\nadmirably adapted for the exhibition of the beauty of the brilliolette\r\nmodel. This form, with numerous small facets, in both instances would\r\nhave given more luminous points, and therefore produced more splendid\r\neffects.\r\n\r\nBabinet properly exclaims against the mode of cutting the large gems\r\nwith large facets, as thereby much of the glory of the gem is lost. Had\r\nthe Regent, even, been cut with smaller and more numerous facets, its\r\nsplendors would have been greater. As we have previously stated, the\r\nmost vivid play of light and color is exhibited in diamonds of about\r\nten karats or less; we may, perhaps, attribute the difference to the\r\nviolation of some law in optics, as well as to the difference in the\r\nlaminæ or substance of the larger stones.\r\n\r\nBabinet, in defence of his remarks on this interesting subject, states\r\nthat the beautiful rainbow hues are produced by the light entering\r\nthe upper surfaces of the gem, and, being reflected backwards from\r\nthe bottom surfaces, is then refracted, after traversing the side\r\nfacets. The white light is then decomposed into every variety of hue,\r\nthe perfection of which depends upon the condition of reflection and\r\nrefraction. If the facets are too large and the light too voluminous\r\nthere is danger of neutralization of these colors, and that white light\r\nbe reproduced.\r\n\r\nWe doubt very much if this historic gem has been known to history for\r\nmore than five hundred years. If it is, as it has been alleged, a part\r\nof the Great Mogul, its appearance among mankind dates from 1550.\r\nHad it been known in the times when Timour so mercilessly attacked\r\nIndia, it could hardly have escaped the rapacity of the Tatar. And\r\nthe history of this conquest, in the latter part of the fourteenth\r\ncentury, leads us to believe that all, or nearly all, of the great\r\ndiamonds of Bengal have been discovered since that time. Had this gem\r\nbeen added to the Mogul treasury at Delhi in 1304, from the conquest\r\nof Malwa by Ala-ud-deen, it probably would have been known to Timour.\r\nThe last Tatar invasion, in 1736, under Nadir Shah, found the gem set\r\nin the turban of the Great Mogul, and it was carried away to Khorasan\r\nby the victorious host, together with all the fabulous wealth which\r\nhad been garnered up during nearly four centuries of prosperity. From\r\nNadir it was wrested by assassination, and passed from ruler to ruler,\r\nwith strange vicissitudes, until the Sikh power succumbed to the arms\r\nof England; when it passed, in 1850, with other treasures, from the\r\nstronghold of Lahore to the jewel-chamber of Windsor Castle.\r\n\r\nIll fortune has always attended the possession of this gem, it is\r\nsaid; and certainly the reduction of the stone in the blind attempt\r\nto improve its brilliancy may be classed in this category. The\r\nHindoos have always maintained that it inevitably brought ruin to\r\nits possessor; and surely, the history of the Mogul Empire, the reign\r\nof Nadir Shah, its conqueror, the Dooranee dynasty, and the rule of\r\nthe Sikhs give strength to the plausibility of the tradition. In the\r\nchapter on the gems of Asia we shall again refer to this stone.\r\n\r\nEngland has had the opportunity, during her Indian conquests, of\r\ncollecting the most magnificent parure of gems the world has seen. The\r\npride of the French Crown, the matchless Regent, was brought to London\r\nby the English Governor, Pitt, and offered to the Royal House; the\r\ngreat Orloff, the boast of the Russian regalia, was brought from India\r\nby an Englishman, Earl Effingham; and many other fine diamonds and\r\ngems from Hindostan have been brought within the reach of the English\r\nCrown before being offered elsewhere for disposition. The neglect to\r\nsecure these beautiful and matchless treasures is inexcusable even in a\r\ncommercial view, for a gem paragon is “an empire made portable.”\r\n\r\nAmong the diamonds brought from India by Englishmen, the Pigott and the\r\nNassac deserve some mention.\r\n\r\nThe Pigott was a splendid gem of 47¹⁄₂ karats, and derived its name\r\nfrom its importer. In 1801 it was placed in a lottery in London, and\r\nvalued at $150,000. The lucky drawer of the prize was content to part\r\nwith it for $30,000 to an English jeweller, who afterwards sold it to\r\nAli Pacha of Egypt. The Egyptian prince conceived a strange attachment\r\nto the gem. He did not display it among the ornaments on his person;\r\nbut concealed it in a silken bag which he attached to his girdle. The\r\nstory goes that when Ali was mortally wounded by Reschid Pacha he\r\ngave orders to have his favorite wife, Vasilika, strangled, and also\r\ncommanded Captain D’Anglas to crush the diamond in his presence. A\r\nsingle blow of the hammer crushed to atoms this beautiful gem, which\r\nwas really one of the finest in Europe on account of the perfection of\r\nits form and the absolute purity of its water. The model alone remains.\r\nThe fascinating Vasilika by some means managed to escape the sentence\r\nof death.\r\n\r\nThe Nassac diamond was brought from India by the Marquis of Hastings,\r\nand formed a part of the Deccan booty. After passing through several\r\nownerships it was finally purchased by the Marquis of Westminster for\r\nabout fifty thousand dollars. It has since been recut into a triangular\r\nform, and its original weight reduced from eighty-nine to about\r\nseventy-eight karats. In its new form it has gained vastly in lustre\r\nand brilliancy.\r\n\r\nThe famous blue diamond known as the Hope diamond, from the fact that\r\nit belonged to one of the distinguished family of bankers of that name,\r\nis really one of the most valuable diamonds in Europe, for it is indeed\r\none of the marvels of the mineral kingdom. Its weight is 44¹⁄₂ karats,\r\nbut its history is unknown; and this obscurity leads to the suspicion\r\nit may be the lost gem of the French casket since reduced in size. It\r\nis now mounted as a medallion with a border of rose-cut diamonds and\r\ntwenty brilliants, each of one karat weight and of the finest water.\r\n\r\nThis beautiful gem was shown to the public at the great Exhibition of\r\n1851 in London, and the description given of it by Mr. Hertz is worth\r\nrepeating here. It is “a most magnificent and rare brilliant of a\r\ndeep sapphire-blue, of the greatest purity and most beautifully cut:\r\nit is of true proportions, not too thick nor too wide-spread. This\r\nmatchless gem combines the beautiful color of the sapphire with the\r\nprismatic fire and brilliancy of the diamond; and on account of its\r\nextraordinary color, great size, and other fine qualities, it certainly\r\nmay be called unique, as we may presume that there exists no cabinet\r\nnor any collection of crown jewels in the world which can boast of the\r\npossession of so curious and fine a gem.”\r\n\r\nThe value of this wonderful specimen of Nature’s work has been\r\nvariously estimated. It is understood that Mr. Hope paid but $65,000\r\nfor it, which is a mere bagatelle to its comparative worth. To our\r\nview this matchless gem should be valued as highly as any of the fine\r\nparagon diamonds of the world, and we do not include the Koh-i-noor as\r\namong this number. In this estimate we refer only to the comparison of\r\nactual merits and qualities, unbiassed by the whims of royalty or of\r\nfashion.\r\n\r\nA hundred years ago and more the citizens of London, transported with\r\njoy over the victory at Culloden by the Duke of Cumberland, hailed the\r\nsoldier as a hero and a deliverer, and presented him with a beautiful\r\ndiamond. It was a splendid gem of thirty-two karats weight, and cost\r\nthe city the sum of $50,000. Not many years ago, however, the House of\r\nHanover laid claim to the gem by reason of certain laws of inheritance;\r\nand we are informed that Queen Victoria, after investigating the claim,\r\nordered the gem to be given up to the claimant.\r\n\r\nMr. Hertz, of London, in the course of his long experience collected a\r\nvery costly, as well as unique and beautiful, collection of gems. His\r\ncabinet of diamonds, embracing almost every shade and color, rivalled\r\nin excellence the celebrated Wernerian cabinet at Freiburg, and that of\r\nAbbé Haüy at the Jardin des Plantes at Paris; but was surpassed by that\r\nof Helmreicher now preserved in the Imperial Museum at Vienna.\r\n\r\nAs the reader may be interested in the tastes of the English nobility\r\nin the good old times, we will look over a few of the pages of English\r\nhistory, and relate some of the incidents of court life, and describe\r\nthe appearance of some of the distinguished characters of different\r\nreigns.\r\n\r\nEleanor of Provence exhibited great extravagance at her coronation\r\nas Queen of King Henry III., who was called the greatest fop of his\r\ntime (1236). It was probably Eleanor who established the fashion of\r\nwearing chaplets of gold and gems over the hair. On the occasion of\r\nher coronation she had on no less than nine garlands or wreaths formed\r\nof gold and clusters of colored precious stones. She had, also, among\r\nher regalia, a great crown glorious with gems, and girdles radiant\r\nwith the most beautiful specimens of the mineral kingdom. The wedding\r\npresent from her sister, Queen Marguerite of France, was a large silver\r\npeacock, whose train was set with sapphires and pearls and other\r\nprecious stones. It was used as a reservoir for perfumed waters.\r\n\r\nIt seems that the old Crusaders were wont to deck themselves with\r\ngems; and Provençal traditions declare that the first intimation Queen\r\nBerengaria had of the seizure of Richard Cœur de Lion was the sale of a\r\nbelt adorned with gems, which she knew he wore and would not part with\r\nexcept by violence.\r\n\r\nThe coronation of Henry VIII. was attended with extraordinary splendor,\r\nand the King was arrayed with the finest gems that could be obtained.\r\n\r\nAt the famous Tournament of the Cloth of Gold, the English and French\r\nnobility attempted to outshine each other in the magnificence of their\r\ndresses and decorations. And the vanity of the festival caused the\r\nfinancial distress or ruin of many a gallant knight.\r\n\r\nAt the banquet at this time King Henry gave Anne Boleyn a beautiful\r\njewel valued at 15,000 crowns.\r\n\r\nWhen Bluff King Hal went to meet his bride, Anne of Cleves, he was\r\narrayed so magnificently as to be likened by the wits of the time to\r\nthe “king of diamonds.” He wore a coat of purple velvet curiously\r\nembroidered with gold and lace. “The sleeves were cut, and lined with\r\ncloth of gold, and clasped with great buttons of diamonds, rubies,\r\nand Orient pearls; his sword and girdle set with stones and special\r\nemeralds; his cap garnished with stones, but his bonnet was so rich of\r\njewels that few men could value them. Besides all this he wore a collar\r\nof such Balais rubies and pearls that few men ever saw the like.”\r\n\r\nHenry demanded of Francis I. of France, the gems and jewels which\r\nhad belonged to his sister Mary, who had married Louis XII. Among\r\nthem were a ruby two inches and a half long, some great pearls, and\r\nlarge diamonds, forming together a casket which the Earl of Worcester\r\ndescribes as the “goodliest and richest sight of jewels he ever saw.”\r\nBut they were never returned; and Francis refused to allow the claim on\r\naccount of the loss of the fine diamond known as the Mirror of Naples,\r\nand which he valued at 30,000 crowns. What this diamond really was, and\r\nits subsequent history, is still a matter of historical conjecture.\r\n\r\nMary Queen of Scots, when married to the Dauphin of France in 1558,\r\nwas decked in a marvellous manner with all that art could afford at\r\nthe time. Her crown was of exquisite workmanship, and was composed of\r\ngold, with diamonds, pearls, rubies, and emeralds of immense value,\r\nhaving a huge carbuncle suspended in the middle valued at half a\r\nmillion crowns. Around her neck was hung the esteemed jewel known in\r\nScottish history as the “Great Harry.” The inventories of her property\r\nshow that she possessed a large number of valuable gems. It seems that\r\nshe lavished upon Bothwell, before they parted at Carberry Hill, jewels\r\nof more than $30,000 in value.\r\n\r\nOne of the most magnificent pageants known in English history was\r\nthat celebrated by the wealth of England and illustrated with the\r\npoetry of Ben Jonson, and which was the occasion of investing the\r\neldest son of Queen Anne with the rights of the Prince of Wales, in\r\n1609. The “Glorious Masque,” which took place at this time, has never\r\nbeen excelled in England. The whole court of England and all the\r\naristocratic beauties of the day were engaged in the event. The palace\r\nof Whitehall was transformed into a scene of enchantment under the\r\nhands of the best artists of the time, guided by the taste of Inigo\r\nJones. This magnificent festival, characterized by so many beautiful\r\nand dazzling scenes, was the happiest in the life of Queen Anne of\r\nDenmark.\r\n\r\nA few years after this glorious celebration, which lingered in the\r\nmemory of the participants like a golden dream, Queen Anne died; and\r\nthe King, on opening her coffers and cabinets, discovered that all of\r\nher beautiful gems and jewels had disappeared; and notwithstanding the\r\nQueen’s maid and attendants were arrested, and diligent search made in\r\nall directions, there is no evidence that even a trace was ever found\r\nof the missing treasure. No vestige was ever obtained of the jewels\r\nwhich Herrick made for her, and which were worth nearly $200,000.\r\n\r\nWhen the Duke of Buckingham was sent to Paris, in 1625, to bring over\r\nto England Queen Henrietta Maria, he carried with him twenty-seven rich\r\nsuits of clothing, as beautiful and valuable as the invention of the\r\ntimes could make them. The suit arranged for his entry into Paris was\r\nreckoned of a value of more than a quarter of a million of dollars. It\r\nwas made of white satin and uncut velvet, set all over with diamonds.\r\nHis spurs, hat-band, feather, girdle, and sword were all covered with\r\ndiamonds. For the wedding day, at Paris, he had a suit of purple\r\nsatin, embroidered all over with Orient pearls, and a cloak to match,\r\nmade after the Spanish fashion, all of the value of about one hundred\r\nthousand dollars.\r\n\r\nCharles I. had many fine gems and jewels at his disposal; and,\r\naccording to the documents still extant, he made free use of them. The\r\nvery first year of his reign, he examined the contents of the jewel\r\nhouse, with a view of pledging them in the future; and it is said that\r\nhis queen, Henrietta, raised in one year ten millions of dollars on the\r\nroyal jewels. The great collar of rubies was sold in Holland.\r\n\r\nCharles, in the days of his prosperity, was an eager purchaser of gems\r\nand jewelry; and a record is preserved which shows that he bought in a\r\nyear and a half, a quarter of a million dollars’ worth of jewelry, and\r\nchiefly to use as gifts. It is also related that he bought the great\r\ndiamond which Sir Paul Pindar brought home from Constantinople, and\r\nwhich he valued at $150,000. The subsequent history of this rare gem is\r\nto be placed among the mysterious things of the past.\r\n\r\nThe queen of James II. was ornamented for the coronation in a manner\r\nthat would have startled even Lollia Paulina; and a half million\r\ndollars were expended in dressing her up. The diadem also was a\r\nwondrous piece of extravagance for the times, and cost more than five\r\nhundred and fifty thousand dollars. The historian of the times states\r\nthat “the jewels she had on were reckoned at a million’s worth, which\r\nmade her shine like an angel.” The exiled Queen, in the after years of\r\nher widowhood, said to the nuns of Chaillot, “My dress and royal mantle\r\nwere covered with precious stones; and it took all the jewels that the\r\ngoldsmiths of London could procure to decorate my crown.”\r\n\r\nWhen Queen Caroline was crowned as consort of George II., she made use\r\nof all the material she could find in London. And Lord Hervey exclaims\r\nthat “the appearance and the truth of her finery was a mixture of\r\nmagnificence and meanness not unlike the eclat of royalty in many other\r\nparticulars, when it comes to be nicely considered, and its source\r\ntraced to what money hires and flattery lends.” For it is stated that\r\nshe used upon her head all the pearls and necklaces she could borrow\r\nfrom the ladies of quality; and that she placed upon her petticoat all\r\nthe diamonds she could hire of the Jews and jewellers in town.\r\n\r\nWhen Philip of Spain went to England to receive his bride, Queen Mary,\r\nthe ceremonies on the occasion were conducted with great splendor. The\r\nKing was accompanied by sixty of the most distinguished grandees of\r\nSpain, clad in royal array. He was dressed in a robe of rich brocade\r\nbordered with large pearls and diamonds. His trunk hose were of white\r\nsatin worked with silver. He wore a collar of beaten gold full of\r\ninestimable diamonds, and from which hung the jewel of the Golden\r\nFleece. Around his knee was the Garter, studded with beautiful gems of\r\nvarious colors.\r\n\r\nThe daughter of Henry VIII. inherited her father’s love for ornamental\r\ndisplay; and at the time of her marriage with Philip of Spain, she\r\nappeared magnificently arrayed. She is described as wearing a robe\r\nwhose ample train was bordered with pearls and diamonds of immense size\r\nand value. The large sleeves were ornamented with clusters of gold set\r\nwith pearls and diamonds. Her coif was bordered with two rows of large\r\ndiamonds; and she wore on her breast a splendid diamond of inestimable\r\nvalue, which Philip had sent her as a gift. Mary, on her death-bed,\r\nsent the most of her jewels to her sister Elizabeth of England; and\r\nKing Philip added to them a casket of very beautiful gems.\r\n\r\nElizabeth, when she became Queen of England, gradually acquired a\r\npassion for jewelry, which finally became absurd and grotesque. She\r\npossessed at one time two thousand dresses and an immense quantity of\r\ngems. The portrait of Queen Elizabeth at Henham Hall represents her\r\nin a blaze of jewels. She appears with an enormous ruff, which rose\r\nas a bird-like structure behind the fabric of jewels which adorned\r\nher head, until it overtopped the cross of her regal diadem. A rich\r\ncollar of gold, woven in delicate filigree work, set with pearls,\r\nrubies, and amethysts, adorned her neck. The bodice of her dress was\r\nalso ornamented with gold filigree set with many gems; and the sleeves\r\nwere profusely ornamented to match the bodice. Horace Walpole, in\r\ndescribing her portraits, says, “There is not one that can be called\r\nbeautiful. The profusion of ornaments with which they are loaded are\r\nmarks of her continual fondness for dress; while they entirely exclude\r\nall grace, and leave no more room for a painter’s genius, than if he\r\nhad been employed to copy an Indian idol, totally composed of hands and\r\nnecklaces. A pale Roman nose; a head of hair loaded with crowns, and\r\npowdered with diamonds; a vast ruff, a vaster fardingale, and a bushel\r\nof pearls,--are features by which everybody knows at once the picture\r\nof Elizabeth.”\r\n\r\nSir Walter Raleigh dressed himself in a gorgeous manner, and was\r\nprofusely decorated with gems. On court days, even his shoes wore gems\r\nof the value of more than $30,000 (£6,600). His armor was of solid\r\nsilver, with sword and belt blazing with diamonds, rubies, and pearls.\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Buckingham, the favorite of King James, wore his diamonds\r\nloosely attached, so that he might shake off a few at pleasure. His\r\ncloaks were trimmed with great diamond buttons; his hat-bands were of\r\ndiamonds; also his cockades. Among his many rich suits was one of white\r\nuncut velvet, set all over with diamonds, to the value of £80,000;\r\nbesides a great feather bespangled with diamonds, as well as his sword,\r\ngirdle, hat, and spurs.\r\n\r\nIn olden times the shrine of Thomas à Becket was famous throughout\r\nEngland and attracted countless devotees from all parts of the realm.\r\nOne hundred thousand persons of all ranks are said to have visited it\r\nin one year, offering a vast variety of gifts. In the twelfth century\r\nLouis VII. of France, disguised as a common pilgrim in the meanest\r\ngarb, visited the shrine and presented it with a famous precious\r\nstone, called the Regale of France, and as large as a bird’s egg. Not\r\na fragment of this glittering and splendid shrine--a mass of gold and\r\njewels--remains at the present day to interest the antiquary; and its\r\ntreasures have been scattered to the winds, leaving no trace behind.\r\n\r\nThe churches of England, as well as France and Spain, were at one time\r\nenormously rich in precious stones and ecclesiastical ornaments of the\r\njewellers’ art; but wars and insurrections are fatal to collections of\r\nthe rare and the beautiful; and the fury and cupidity of the Leaguers,\r\nthe iconoclasts, and the revolutionists have destroyed these treasures\r\nof art and nature, or dispersed them so that their identity is lost.\r\n\r\nThe magnificence of the English clergy led Pope Innocent III. to\r\nexclaim, “O England, thou garden of delights! Thou art truly an\r\ninexhaustible fount of riches. From thy abundance much may be exacted.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER X.\r\n\r\n                             ASIATIC GEMS.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo Asia we naturally turn for the history of the diamond, and a\r\nsolution of some of the phenomena connected with the mineral. But\r\nhere we have to contend with vexations at all points; and instead of\r\nclearness, we have obscurity, disconnected histories, conflicting\r\ntraditions, and superstitious fancies. However, from the mass of\r\nfragments which have been preserved, the patient antiquary eventually\r\nmay be able to arrange an interesting story relating to the gem in the\r\nearly days of its discovery and its adoption in ornamentation.\r\n\r\nWe will now proceed to mention some of the celebrated stones whose\r\nhistory has been more or less clearly defined; and regret to say that\r\nthere are a large number of others of great interest and value, but of\r\nwhich we are unable to give a correct description.\r\n\r\nThe Hindoos prize diamonds greatly on account of their supposed\r\nspiritual properties, and they reluctantly part with them unless\r\ncompelled by dire necessity, or induced by the hope of greater\r\ngain. Many of the fine diamonds brought to Europe from Asia have\r\nblood-stained histories, and some of them are connected with appalling\r\natrocities. Therefore we may with propriety say that few of the noble\r\ngems would have found their way to Europe had the free will of their\r\nrightful owners been consulted.\r\n\r\nThe foremost gem in the history of the diamond was that which was\r\ncalled the Great Mogul. This was the largest of all known diamonds,\r\nand was found in the rich mines of Gani about the year 1650, or nearly\r\na century after their discovery. It became the property of Vizier\r\nMirgimola, who, although a Persian by birth, had by ability and tact\r\nrisen to the honor of general and vizier to the King of Golconda. By\r\nmeans of his rapacity in war, and his success in working the diamond\r\nmines, he became enormously wealthy, and accumulated immense numbers of\r\ngems. The King finally became jealous of the wealth and power of his\r\nfavorite, and resolved to destroy him. But Mirgimola, warned of his\r\ndanger in time, succeeded in escaping with all his treasures to the\r\ncapital of Shah Jehan, the Great Mogul. The wily Persian gained the\r\nfavor and protection of the Hindoo monarch by magnificent presents of\r\ngems, the chief of which was the immense diamond which has since been\r\ncalled the Great Mogul.\r\n\r\nThe original weight of this mammoth gem is said to have been 787¹⁄₂\r\nkarats; but during the process of cutting it was reduced to 279 karats.\r\nTavernier relates that the work had been intrusted to a Venetian\r\nlapidary by the name of Hortensio Borghis, who, ignorant of the duties\r\nof his task, removed the flaws and external imperfections by grinding\r\nthe surface of the stone away. The labor required by this operation\r\nseems almost incredible when we come to consider the hardness of the\r\nstone, and estimate the difficulty of polishing it, especially with\r\nthe rude means then in use by the Oriental lapidaries. The cutting\r\nof the Pitt diamond (now the Regent) required two years’ time, with\r\nthe aid of modern appliances and the facilities afforded by means of\r\ncleavage, by which large fragments were removed and utilized. Therefore\r\nthe statement that this stone was reduced solely by grinding from\r\n787¹⁄₂ karats to 279 karats is likely to meet with disbelief among the\r\nlapidaries; for the operation must have required more than the fifteen\r\nyears which had elapsed from the discovery of the gem to the time\r\nTavernier examined it. Tavernier says distinctly that cleavage was not\r\nresorted to in facilitating the reduction of the stone. We quote: “Had\r\nthe Sieur Hortensio been well acquainted with his profession he might\r\nhave obtained from this great stone some good pieces without doing\r\nany injury to the King, and without having taken so much trouble in\r\ngrinding it away; but he was not a very skilful diamond-cutter.” This\r\nstatement establishes the fact that the secret of reducing diamonds by\r\ncleavage was known at that time.\r\n\r\nFifteen years after the discovery Tavernier saw the gem in the hands\r\nof Aurungzeb, who was then Mogul, Shah Jehan having been deposed and\r\nplaced in confinement. The distinguished traveller was allowed to\r\nexamine the gem, weigh it, and make a drawing of it. It was then of\r\nthe form of half an egg, and very high-crowned, and had been cut with\r\nmany facets, quite regularly arranged over its superior surfaces. It\r\nwas also of fine water, and disfigured by only one crack on its lower\r\nborder, and a little flaw in the interior.\r\n\r\nThe French traveller gives an account of the ceremony of his\r\nexamination as conducted with great precision and the utmost solemnity,\r\nas though the gems were the crystallizations or the embodiments of\r\ndeparted spirits. The gems were brought in upon two lacquered trays\r\ncovered with brocade, and were counted over thrice, and three lists\r\nmade of them by different scribes. This process was not particularly\r\nflattering to the pride of the guest, but it serves to illustrate or\r\nestablish the fact that the Hindoo character for deception and theft\r\nwas quite as marked then as now.\r\n\r\nSince this period no further mention has been made of the gem by\r\nany authentic writer; but it is supposed to have formed a part of\r\nthe plunder of Delhi, when Nadir Shah captured all the treasures\r\naccumulated during four hundred years of prosperity, and which were\r\nvalued at from $150,000,000 to $350,000,000.\r\n\r\nThe next largest diamond shown to Tavernier was one of only 54¹⁄₂\r\nkarats, and all the rest were much inferior. Hence it is surmised that\r\nthe Koh-i-noor, the Shah, and the Daria-i-noor were then unknown, and\r\nwere discovered at a later period. But it is stated that the former\r\nMogul, who was still in confinement, retained many of the gems of\r\nhis own collecting, and that they may have been among them. Or they\r\nmay have been in possession of Mirgimola. At all events, the Mogul\r\ndisappeared with the last Tatar invasion; and new paragons, like the\r\nKoh-i-noor, became known to the world. After the assassination of Nadir\r\nShah his treasures were scattered among many chieftains, and all record\r\nof many of them has been lost.\r\n\r\nThe fate of the Mogul is shrouded in mystery. The famous gem preserved\r\nin the Persian treasury and called Daria-i-noor, “the ocean of lustre,”\r\nwhich Forbes saw and described, is not the lost stone. By some it is\r\nbelieved to be hidden away in some obscure fortress, to appear at\r\nsome future day when the possessor may display his hidden treasure in\r\nsafety. This view is certainly warranted by the discovery of the large\r\nflat diamond of one hundred and thirty karats among the jewels taken\r\nfrom the harem of Reeza Kooli at the capture of Coocha by the Persian\r\narmy in 1832. Also the finding of the celebrated crown of Chosroes by\r\nAbbas in the treasury of one of the Princes in the Lauristan Mountains\r\nnear the Persian Gulf, where it had lain concealed for a thousand years.\r\n\r\nWere it not for the general accuracy and truthfulness of Tavernier,\r\nand the drawing he has left of the diamond, we might claim the Orloff\r\nas the missing Mogul. Certainly the resemblance in form is very\r\nremarkable; and the location of the flaws, with the rare circumstance\r\nof shape, are facts very strongly in favor of the Orloff. The question\r\nnow arises, did Tavernier make an error in his weight and draw the\r\noutlines carelessly or from memory? We have seen how confused history\r\nhas become regarding the identity of the Sancy diamond.\r\n\r\nThe real Koh-i-noor of Hindoo history is probably the great Mogul\r\nor the Orloff; and the name would be appropriately applied to the\r\ndome-like shape of both of the stones, with their flashing beams of\r\nlight, rather than to the flattened form of the English stone now\r\ncalled the Koh-i-noor, and which exhibited but little lustre. It\r\nis highly probable that the diamond of Runjeet Sing, the English\r\nKoh-i-noor, was one of the magnificent diamonds surrendered to Nadir\r\nShah by Mohammed Shah at the sack of Delhi in 1739, but there is no\r\npositive proof of his obtaining the great heirloom of the descendants\r\nof Aurungzeb.\r\n\r\nIn reviewing the history of the Great Mogul gems, from the time of\r\nTavernier down to the present day, we are inclined to regard the term\r\nKoh-i-noor, or “mountain of light,” as a misnomer, and that the gem\r\nreceived this distinction only after its arrival at Kabul, or came\r\ninto the possession of Runjeet Sing; neither have we any evidence to\r\nprove that the Koh-i-noor was the Great Mogul; for that appellation is\r\nnot given to it by the early writers. But it is not probable that the\r\nterm, so superlative of excellence and superiority, would be applied\r\nto an inferior gem, while the great diamond of the Mogul, weighing two\r\nhundred and eighty karats, was in existence.\r\n\r\nThe history of all these great diamonds is very obscure; and as the\r\nvalue of the Indian weights and measures varies so much at different\r\nplaces and at different times, it is quite impossible to follow with\r\nprecision the fragments of history that relate to them.\r\n\r\nSeveral accounts have been given of the manner in which the Koh-i-noor\r\nfell into the clutches of Runjeet; but that of Dr. Wilson, as published\r\nin the official catalogue of the great Exhibition at London, is\r\nprobably correct. It is as follows:--\r\n\r\n “When Shah Soujah was driven from Kabul, he became the nominal guest\r\n and actual prisoner of Runjeet Sing, who spared neither opportunity\r\n nor menace until, in 1813, he compelled the fugitive monarch to resign\r\n the precious gem, presenting him on the occasion, it is said, with a\r\n lakh of rupees, or about £12,000 sterling.\r\n\r\n “According to Shah Soujah’s own account, however, he assigned to\r\n him the revenues of three villages, not one rupee of which he ever\r\n realized. Runjeet was highly elated by the acquisition of the diamond,\r\n and wore it as an armlet at all public festivals.\r\n\r\n “When he was dying, an attempt was made by persons about him to\r\n persuade him to make the diamond a present to Juggernaut; and it is\r\n said he intimated by an inclination of the head his assent. The\r\n treasurer, however, in whose charge it was, refused to give it up\r\n without some better warrant; and Runjeet dying before a written order\r\n could be signed by him, the Koh-i-noor was preserved for a while\r\n for his successors. It was occasionally worn by Khurruk Sing and\r\n Shir Sing. After the murder of the latter it remained in the Lahore\r\n Treasury until the supersession of Dhulip Sing and the annexation of\r\n the Punjaub by the British Government, when the civil authorities took\r\n possession of the Lahore Treasury, under the stipulation previously\r\n made, that all the property of the State should be confiscated to the\r\n East India Company, in part payment of the debt due by the Lahore\r\n Government, and of the expenses of the war. It was at the same time\r\n stipulated that the Koh-i-noor should be surrendered to the Queen of\r\n England.\r\n\r\n “The diamond was conveyed to Bombay by Governor General the Earl of\r\n Dalhousie, whom ill health had compelled to repair to the coast, and\r\n was then given in charge to Lieutenant-Colonel Mackeson, C. B., and\r\n Captain T. Ramsay, the Military Secretary to the Governor General,\r\n to take to England. These officers embarked on board Her Majesty’s\r\n steamship ‘Medea,’ and left Bombay on the 6th of April, 1850. They\r\n arrived at Portsmouth on the 30th of June; and two days afterwards\r\n relinquished their charge to the Chairman and Deputy-chairman of the\r\n Court of Directors, by whom, in company with the President of the\r\n Board of Control, the Koh-i-noor was delivered to her Majesty on\r\n the 3d of July,--an appropriate and honorable close to its eventful\r\n career.”\r\n\r\nWe are led to infer from the accounts of history that some of the\r\nIndian rulers collected enormous quantities of the precious stones.\r\nIt is stated that Mahmoud, in his campaign in India about the eleventh\r\ncentury, captured the temple Bheen, which, according to Ferishta,\r\ncontained a greater quantity of precious stones and pearls “than was\r\never collected in the royal treasury of any prince on earth.” They were\r\ncarried off to Ghizna.\r\n\r\nIn another campaign the idol at Sumnat, fifteen feet high, was\r\ncaptured, which being broken open yielded great quantities of rubies,\r\ndiamonds, and pearls which had been concealed in it. These were\r\ncarried to Ghizna. Ferishta says Ala-ud-deen obtained from the Raja of\r\nMahrattas fifty pounds of diamonds, rubies, emeralds, and sapphires,\r\nand also one hundred and seventy-five pounds of pearls.\r\n\r\nIn the middle of the sixteenth century Acber of India gave a splendid\r\nbanquet in honor of his birthday; and, if the reports concerning it are\r\ncorrect, it was one of the most magnificent entertainments ever given\r\non the earth. Acres of land were covered with silken and flaxen tents,\r\nand the horses and elephants were bespangled with gold and gems. The\r\ntents of the Nabob were not only exquisitely made and adorned, but even\r\nthe carpets which covered the earth were richly embroidered with gold,\r\npearls, and precious stones. In describing the beauty and magnificence\r\nof the Hindoo nobles, the historian states that they were adorned with\r\ndiamonds that “sparkled like the firmament.”\r\n\r\nShah Jehan, the greatest of Mogul sovereigns since Timour, collected\r\nthe wealth of India around him, and lavished it in a manner that reads\r\nmore like a chapter in the “Arabian Nights” than a page of historic\r\nreality. At his death the treasury contained $150,000,000; and his\r\npalace, with its embellishments and ornaments, was the most beautiful\r\nthe world has ever seen. The Peacock Throne was valued at $30,000,000,\r\nand his crown at $12,000,000. The diadem had twelve points, each tipped\r\nwith a diamond of large size and the purest water. In the centre was\r\nembedded a huge pearl, and the rest of the crown was a glittering mass\r\nof rubies, diamonds, and other gems.\r\n\r\nThe dress of the Emperor was in keeping with his extravagance: around\r\nhis neck he wore three strings of immense pearls; his arms were covered\r\nwith armlets of diamonds and bracelets of other gems; his sword and\r\nbuckler were incrusted with diamonds and rubies; and his sceptre was\r\nentwined with a chain of pearls, rubies, and diamonds. Besides his\r\ncrown, he had a rich turban plumed with long heron feathers; on one\r\nside was a huge ruby, on the other a diamond, while an immense emerald\r\ndecorated the front.\r\n\r\nThe famous Peacock Throne of Indian history is no myth; for Tavernier\r\nexamined it with care, and has left a description of it so clear, that\r\nits reality and its value are matters of fact. It was so called from\r\nthe figures of two peacocks with expanded tails standing behind it as\r\nlarge as life. These figures were constructed of gold and precious\r\nstones of all varieties, and so arranged as to represent the natural\r\ncolors of the birds. The beautiful hues of the feathers were closely\r\nimitated by the arrangement of fine rubies, diamonds, sapphires,\r\nemeralds, and other gems.\r\n\r\nThe throne was six feet long and four feet wide, and was constructed\r\nof solid gold, inlaid with diamonds, emeralds, and rubies. Steps of\r\nsilver were placed in front of it; while a canopy of gold, fringed with\r\npearls, supported by twelve pillars emblazoned with flashing gems,\r\nsurmounted the whole. Between the peacocks stood a representation of\r\nthe parrot, carved from emerald or some green stone. On each side of\r\nthe throne was placed one of the sacred umbrellas, called chattars,\r\nmade of richly embroidered crimson velvet fringed with pearls. Their\r\nhandles were of solid gold, about eight feet long, and studded with\r\ndiamonds. This was the most costly and superb work of art of its kind\r\never invented.\r\n\r\nIts rival was the Cerulean Throne of the House of Bhamenee in the\r\nNizam. It was constructed in the seventeenth century, and, according to\r\nthe description of Ferishta, the Persian historian, was nine feet long\r\nby three feet wide, made of ebony, covered with plates of gold, and\r\nincrusted with gems. Its value was estimated at quite twenty millions\r\nof dollars. At the sack of Delhi, the Peacock Throne, with many other\r\npriceless relics, fell into the hands of Nadir Shah and his ravenous\r\nfollowers, and was carried off by them, and broken up.\r\n\r\nWe may form an idea of the magnificent costumes worn by the Eastern\r\nmonarchs, from the description given by Mr. Elphinstone, the British\r\nenvoy to the King of Kabul, in 1808. At the reception given to the\r\nembassy, the king was literally covered with gems. At first sight, he\r\nappeared to be clothed with an armor composed of jewels; but, on close\r\ninspection, his dress was found to consist of a green tunic covered\r\nwith large flowers in gold and precious stones. Over these a large\r\nbreastplate of diamonds shaped like two flattened _fleurs de lis_ was\r\nworn. Upon each thigh, ornaments fashioned after the same manner were\r\nplaced; while large emerald bracelets appeared on the arms, and many\r\nother jewels were adjusted to different parts of the body. In one\r\nof these bracelets flashed the Koh-i-noor, then regarded as one of\r\nthe largest diamonds in the world. Over the chest were arranged some\r\nstrings of very large pearls, like loose cross-belts. The crown was\r\nabout nine inches high, and formed entirely of precious stones, like\r\nthe wonderful plumes of Prince Esterhazy. It seemed to be radiated,\r\nlike the ancient crowns; and behind the rays appeared peaks of purple\r\nvelvet. Several small branches with pendants apparently projected from\r\nthe crown; but the ornament was so complicated and so dazzling, that it\r\nwas difficult for the spectators to understand it, and quite impossible\r\nto describe it.\r\n\r\nOther famous diamonds besides the Mogul are missing; and modern history\r\nis unable to account for them. What has become of the splendid flat\r\ndiamond weighing two hundred and forty-two karats, which Tavernier\r\nexamined in Golconda; or the immense Agrah of six hundred and\r\nforty-five karats, in the rough, which the same traveller saw in India?\r\nWere they also gathered by the followers of Nadir, and divided in the\r\nspoliation of the property of the conqueror? We know that Persia,\r\nenriched by the last conquest of India, is immensely rich in precious\r\nstones of all descriptions; but the number, the character, and the\r\nvalue of them, are as shadowy as those of Turkey. However, we have a\r\nray of intelligence from Bernier, who hastily estimated the value of\r\nthe Persian jewels at thirteen and one half milliards of francs.\r\n\r\nThis prodigious estimate has been strengthened by the gorgeous\r\nappearance of the last Persian ambassador to France. The costume of\r\nthis Emir fairly blazed with the brilliancy of the most costly gems,\r\nand recalled the departed glory of the last Prince of Esterhazy. The\r\npresents sent at the same time by the Sultan to the Empress Eugenie\r\nwere most magnificent, especially the diamond bracelets, and were\r\nglorious emblems of Oriental favor.\r\n\r\nAmong the diamonds possessed by the Persian Crown, besides the\r\nDaria-i-noor, which is said to weigh two hundred and thirty-two karats,\r\nwe have information of three others of remarkable size and beauty.\r\nThey are named the Taj-Mah, or Crown of the Moon, of one hundred and\r\nforty-six karats; the Sea of Glory, of sixty-six karats; and the\r\nMountain of Splendor, of one hundred and thirty-five karats, valued at\r\n$729,000.\r\n\r\nDr. Beke, at the meeting of the British Association, in 1851, read a\r\npaper on a new diamond that had lately come into the possession of\r\nPersia. He referred to the diamond slab of one hundred and thirty\r\nkarats that had been captured at Coocha, in 1832, and which he thought\r\nmight have been a part of the Koh-i-noor when in its natural state.\r\nThe only account of its history the Persians could obtain, was the\r\nstatement that it was found in the possession of a poor man, a native\r\nof Khorasan, who used it for the purpose of lighting his fires, by\r\nstriking it against steel [the mineral does not possess the property],\r\nand that it had thereby sustained some damage. The gem was presented by\r\nAbbas Murza to his father, Futteh Ali Shah, and is presumed to be now\r\namong the crown jewels of Persia.\r\n\r\nOne of the latest accounts of the Persian treasures is given by Mr.\r\nEastwick, who was permitted to examine them. He found them placed in\r\na small, strongly built room, to which access was had by means of a\r\nnarrow, steep stairway and very small door. In this apartment, spread\r\nout upon thick, velvety carpets, were displayed gems and jewels of the\r\nvalue of $35,000,000. Conspicuous among them was the Kaianian crown,\r\nwhich was shaped like a flower-pot, and topped by an immense uncut\r\nruby as big as a hen’s egg, which is supposed to have come from Siam.\r\nBeside this tiara were spread two lambskins covered with beautiful\r\naigrettes of diamonds; and before them lay trays of pearl, ruby, and\r\nemerald necklaces, with countless rings. The famous Kaianian belt was\r\nalso an object of wonder. This relic of barbaric splendor weighs about\r\ntwenty pounds. It is nearly a foot in depth, and is incrusted massively\r\nwith splendid diamonds, pearls, rubies, and emeralds.\r\n\r\nThe exhibition of arms was worthy of the Oriental taste for martial\r\ndecoration, and recalled to memory the ancient fondness for such\r\nthings, and the sword and scabbard of Mithridates, which has been\r\nmentioned in history as being of enormous value. Some of these, now\r\nbelonging to the Persian Shah, are magnificently decorated with gold\r\nand gems, to the value of more than a quarter of a million of dollars.\r\n\r\nThe arms of defence of the Oriental nations have been noted from the\r\nearliest times for the beauty and splendor of their decorations, in\r\nwhich lavish use has been made of the finest diamonds, emeralds,\r\nrubies, and other precious stones, set in a variety of metals. The\r\nexcellence of these precious productions was made known to the nations\r\nof the Mediterranean by means of commercial caravans long before the\r\ninvasions of Xerxes or Alexander; and some of them are objects of\r\nadmiration to the skilled artisans of the present day.\r\n\r\nIn Lahore, Benares, and Lucknow are yet preserved the secrets of the\r\ngold workers of Assyria and ancient Phœnicia, which have long been\r\nforgotten in the countries where they were invented. The enamels of\r\nthese artisans, especially the green, red, blue, and turquoise hues,\r\nare not surpassed in beauty of tint by the finest enamels of Paris.\r\n\r\nAs Persia is the home of the turquoise, the traveller would expect\r\nto see the finest representative of the mineral species in this\r\ncollection. And he will not be disappointed, for the specimen of\r\nturquoise treasured here above all others is of a magnificent color,\r\nfrom three to four inches long, and without a flaw. Its value is not\r\ngiven; but we may draw an inference from Shylock’s turquoise, which was\r\nworth “a wilderness of monkeys.”\r\n\r\nBesides the above enumerated articles the treasury contains numberless\r\nobjects of value not described, and among them piles of gauntlets and\r\nbelts, massive with pearls and diamonds.\r\n\r\nThe present ruler of Persia, Nasiru’d-din, during his late visit to\r\nEurope, displayed upon his person many of the chief treasures of his\r\ncrown. They were not, however, exhibited to advantage, for his costume\r\nwas an incongruous mixture of the amplitude of nomadic ideas with the\r\nclose-fitting symmetry of the French tailor. The ridiculous figure of\r\nthe Shah, surmounted by the ancient lofty Persian hat, heightened in\r\ncomicality by a pair of gold-bowed spectacles, presented a picture\r\nthat detracted from the splendor of the gems which he wore. His coat,\r\nwhich was made after the style of the Parisian frock, was plaited over\r\nthe hips and adorned with extraordinary gems. From waist to shoulder,\r\narranged in _echelon_, were placed five enormous diamonds, each said\r\nto be larger than the English Koh-i-noor. The collar and sleeves of\r\nthis garment were also fairly incrusted by brilliants of great beauty;\r\nwhile over his breast hung his various insignia and orders set with the\r\nfinest of gems. His sword-belt and sheath were formed of gold, studded\r\nwith diamonds, rubies, and emeralds; while his golden spurs were formed\r\nof diamonds of such perfection as to flash like sunbeams as he walked\r\nalong.\r\n\r\nMany fine diamonds are undoubtedly to be found among the nabobs and\r\nprinces of India. And their concealment may have been advised by the\r\nlessons of the past. Fears of English rapacity may have caused the\r\nfracture of the famous Nizam diamond, or a report to that effect. This\r\nbeautiful gem, which is said to have weighed three hundred and forty\r\nkarats, belonged to the King of Golconda, and is said to have been\r\nbroken at the commencement of the last Indian revolt.\r\n\r\nIn 1807 a fine diamond of seventy-seven karats was obtained by the\r\nRanee Ruthen from the bed of the river Sumbhulpore; and in 1809 a fine\r\ngem of one hundred and sixty-eight karats was found in the sands of the\r\nriver Mahamuddee.\r\n\r\nThe King of Ava possesses many diamonds, but of unknown value. Colonel\r\nSymes saw, in his visit of 1795, many rude ornaments of remarkable\r\nsplendor and value. One of the state carriages fairly blazed with its\r\ndecorations of burnished gold, covered with diamonds and other gems.\r\n\r\nThe Sultan of Mattan in Borneo is said to possess a remarkable diamond;\r\nbut there is some doubt as to its authenticity, like its great rival,\r\nthat of the King of Portugal. But Mr. Hugh Low, Colonial Secretary\r\nof the Island, declares in his work on Sarawak and its productions,\r\npublished in 1848, that the gem of the Sultans is a real diamond,\r\nand of the great weight of three hundred and sixty-seven karats. It\r\nwas, at that time, in the rough state, and its shape was that of an\r\negg indented on one side. Its value was estimated by Mr. Crawford\r\nto be £269,378. Sir Stamford Raffles relates that the stone has\r\nremained as an heirloom in the royal family for four descents, and\r\nis almost the only appendage of royalty now remaining. The Governor\r\nof Batavia, desirous of obtaining the gem, is said to have sent Mr.\r\nStewart to Borneo to negotiate for it. But although the tempting offer\r\nof $150,000, with two brigs of war with their guns and ammunition,\r\nwas made to the Sultan, he refused to deprive his family of the rich\r\ninheritance which was supposed to be in the possession of the diamond.\r\n\r\nIn the time of Sir Stamford Raffles few courts in Europe could boast of\r\na more brilliant display of diamonds than was exhibited by the ladies\r\nof Batavia in the prosperous days of Dutch commerce, when the trade of\r\nIndia and Eastern Asia was to a very great extent in the control of\r\nHolland.\r\n\r\nWe cannot properly close this chapter on the gems of Asia without\r\nmaking a brief allusion to that master-piece of architecture, the Taj\r\nMahal, the palace-tomb, which Shah Jehan erected at Agra in memory\r\nof his beautiful and beloved wife. The Mogul Emperor promised the\r\ndying Empress the most beautiful tomb the world had ever seen; and he\r\nkept his promise. Even to-day, after so many centuries of neglect and\r\npillage, the fairy-like structure rises to the view more like one of\r\nthe dreams of the “Arabian Nights” than a material edifice constructed\r\nby human hands.\r\n\r\nIn its construction the wealth of India was placed at the service\r\nof its architects, and thousands of laborers were employed for many\r\nyears. The chief architect was a Frenchman, M. de Bordeaux, who also\r\ndesigned the famous Peacock Throne at Delhi. Enormous quantities of\r\nprecious and semi-precious stones of all descriptions were used in its\r\nornamentation, and inlaid in its walls, its columns, and ornaments. The\r\nimages were masses of glittering gems, and some of the mosaics were\r\nmarvels of beauty and human skill.\r\n\r\nIn a curious manuscript, still preserved, is given an account of the\r\ngems, jewels, etc., and their value, used in the construction. All\r\nparts of Asia were searched for the richest gems,--Thibet for its\r\nturquoises, Ceylon for its lapis lazuli, Persia for its amethysts,\r\nLunka for its sapphires, and Pannah for its diamonds. The famous Hindoo\r\ntemple of Sumnat was, in the days of its perfection, one of the most\r\nrenowned of all the shrines of India, and must have been a structure of\r\nwonderful richness, when its fifty-six pillars, incrusted and inlaid\r\nwith multitudes of precious stones, sparkled in the morning light. Even\r\nat the present day its ruins, though despoiled of their ornaments, are\r\nvery beautiful and impressive.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\n                            MISCELLANEOUS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe royal family of Brazil are said to possess diamonds of great\r\nbeauty, selected for their superiority from the best of the products of\r\nthe mines of the country. But we have not been able to obtain reliable\r\ndescriptions of them.\r\n\r\nThe Crown of Portugal, by virtue of its inheritance, is said to own\r\nimmense numbers of the gem; and it is understood that they are held in\r\nreserve, and only a certain quantity are to be sold from time to time\r\naccording to the demands of the market. In corroboration of this report\r\nit is said that the Bank of Lisbon, sold, in 1863, rough diamonds to\r\nthe value of 1,800,000 francs out of the collection brought from Brazil\r\nby John VI. in 1821. It was also stated that the value of the remainder\r\nwas estimated at 35,000,000 francs.\r\n\r\nMr. Mawe, at the time of his visit to Lisbon, stated that the treasury\r\nof the King contained diamonds amounting in weight to four thousand or\r\nfive thousand karats. The same traveller and gem-expert says that a\r\nvast number of the Brazilian diamonds have passed into the possession\r\nof the King of Portugal. And he furthermore states that he examined\r\ndiamonds belonging to this potentate, which were worth more than two\r\nmillion pounds sterling.\r\n\r\nAmong the crown jewels of Portugal there is a gem of large dimensions\r\nwhich has been reported to be a diamond weighing 1,680 karats. Mr.\r\nMurray described it to be as large as an ostrich egg, and added that\r\nMr. Mawe informed him that it was a white topaz. Romè de L’Isle, in his\r\ntreatise on Crystallography, published in 1783, describes the stone\r\nas a diamond, but admits that it is suspected to be a white topaz.\r\nIt is a little singular that this discrepancy and obscurity has not\r\nbeen definitely cleared up during all this time, when the character\r\nof the stone can so easily be ascertained. As the massive variety of\r\ndiamond is found in masses of more than one thousand karats, it is even\r\nprobable that the crystalline and transparent variety may occur of\r\nequal weight.\r\n\r\nMr. Murray mentioned a beautiful gem of two hundred and fifteen karats,\r\ncalled the Round Brilliant of Portugal, and estimated its value at\r\n£388,290. Mr. Mawe describes another a little less in size, and also\r\ntwo nearly perfect octahedrons of one hundred and thirty-four and one\r\nhundred and twenty karats each.\r\n\r\nThe state waistcoat of Joseph I. had twenty buttons, each button being\r\ncomposed of a solitaire diamond of the value of $20,000, and the\r\nrest of its ornaments were corresponding in beauty and value. This\r\ngarment is said to have been the richest ever seen in Europe, with the\r\nexception of the recent grand illumination by the Shah of Persia. It\r\nhas also been stated that the golden cane of John VI. had in its top a\r\nsplendid brilliant of the value of a million of francs.\r\n\r\nThe largest of the Brazilian diamonds was discovered as late as 1852,\r\nby a negress working in the mines of Begagem. Like most of the large\r\ndiamonds, its form was not symmetrical, and its shape was much modified\r\nfrom the regular crystalline forms. In 1856 it was brought to France\r\nand exhibited to the members of the Academy of Sciences. The gem then\r\nweighed in its rough state 254¹⁄₂ karats, and appeared perfectly\r\ntransparent and without tint. It was placed in the hands of Coster, of\r\nAmsterdam, for cutting, and reduced in weight to 127 karats. The form\r\ngiven it was the brilliant; but the gem was cut too thin to exhibit\r\nits full beauty. The spread of its table will be found, on comparison,\r\nto be much greater than that of the Regent diamond, which weighs 136\r\nkarats, or almost 10 karats more; therefore Babinet properly exclaims\r\nagainst the taste which adopted an imperfect brilliant, at a great\r\nreduction of weight, when the form of the brilliolette, like that of\r\none of the Sancys, would have preserved three fourths of its weight and\r\ngiven it a more splendid lustre. It would then have been the second\r\ndiamond in weight and beauty in Europe. This gem is known as the Star\r\nof the South, but is sometimes called the Halphen diamond, from the\r\nname of the gentleman who bought it on its arrival in Europe.\r\n\r\nThe gem treasures of the Elector of Saxony are among the most valuable\r\nand unique in Europe. The commencement of their collection dates from\r\nan early period. The famous silver mines, prior to the discovery of\r\nAmerica, placed the Saxon princes among the richest sovereigns of\r\nEurope; and they took pride in exhibiting their magnificence, in\r\nexpending vast sums of money in the purchase of gems, jewels, and works\r\nof art.\r\n\r\nThe treasures thus accumulated during a long period of time are of\r\nimmense value; and the apartments where they are displayed remind\r\nthe observer of the gorgeous descriptions of Oriental magnificence.\r\nAnd unless we except the unknown collection in the Turkish Seraglio\r\nand those of the Crown of Russia, it is the most extensive and\r\ninteresting in the world. All that is rare and beautiful on earth is\r\nhere represented; and the total valuation of all the objects of art\r\nand nature must amount to many millions of dollars. They are contained\r\nin eight large consecutive rooms, each surpassing the previous one\r\nin the splendor and richness of its contents. Among the diamonds are\r\nsome large and unique gems of the rose pattern. The gala dress and the\r\ndecorations of the Elector, which fairly dazzle the eye with their\r\nfloods of brilliancy, are also kept here. In the epaulette there are\r\nthree splendid brilliants which weigh nearly fifty carats each.\r\n\r\nBut the chief attraction among all this vast collection of gems is the\r\nfamous green diamond. This wonderful stone is of oblong form, 1¹⁄₁₂\r\ninches in length by ¹⁰⁄₁₂ of an inch in width, and weighs 31¹⁄₄ karats.\r\nIt is mounted in a clasp, set with large white brilliants. The price\r\npaid for it is kept a profound secret; but it is reported that it was\r\nobtained at Warsaw by Augustus the Strong, and that he paid 60,000\r\nthalers for it. Amateurs generally regard the blue diamond as the most\r\nastonishing and perfect of the products of the mineral kingdom; but we\r\nfail to perceive, in the exhibition of this color, any advantage over\r\nthe fine green or the pure red diamonds.\r\n\r\nThere is another diamond in this collection which is one of the\r\nfinest in Europe, although it weighs but 48³⁄₄ karats. It is known\r\nas the Saxon white brilliant, and is of rare perfection of form\r\nand brilliancy. It is about 1¹⁄₁₂ inches square, and is set in the\r\ninsignia of the Order of the Golden Fleece, surrounded with other fine\r\nbrilliants. Augustus purchased it, and is said to have given more\r\nthan $700,000 for it. This gem has a great reputation for its beauty.\r\nComparison with the Regent, the Orloff, and others, can alone determine\r\nits degree of excellence.\r\n\r\nThe fifth and sixth divisions of the eighth apartment are devoted to\r\nthe display of diamonds, and the insignia of Saxony. The decorations of\r\nthe Elector, consisting of buttons, collar, sword-hilt, and scabbard,\r\nall glittering with diamonds, present a charming appearance. There are\r\nalso to be seen, profusely decorated with gems, the Saxon Order of the\r\nRue Garland, and the seven orders of the Golden Fleece.\r\n\r\nAmong the royal treasures in Munich there are several beautiful pink\r\ndiamonds of large size, and a magnificent blue one of thirty-six\r\nkarats, which is set in the Order of the Golden Fleece.\r\n\r\nIn the treasury of the royal palace may be seen many fine single\r\ndiamonds, together with magnificent emeralds and sapphires of great\r\nvalue. The King’s and Queen’s crowns, resplendent with brilliants,\r\nare kept here, with others of older date which belonged to the former\r\nCounts Palatine. Among the relics are preserved the ancient diadems of\r\nHenry II. and his Empress Kunigunda of the date 1010; also, the orb and\r\nsceptre of the Emperor Charles VII., together with his crown.\r\n\r\nPrussia has but few diamonds, the policy of the Hohenzollerns having\r\nbeen adverse to the purchase of gems as baubles. Austria, however, is\r\nrich in diamonds, and possesses some extraordinary gems. The Imperial\r\nJewel Office at Vienna contains a rare collection of great value. Here\r\nis preserved the famous Regalia of Charlemagne, which were buried\r\nwith the great conqueror in his tomb at Aix la Chapelle. Barbarossa,\r\nin 1165, dared to violate the sanctity of this sepulchre, and removed\r\nthe barbaric jewels, which are of great interest to the antiquary and\r\nthe historian. For several centuries past they have been used at the\r\ncoronation of the German emperors. The crown is a magnificent specimen\r\nof the art of the Middle Ages, and is ornamented with rough diamonds\r\nand other gems in their natural state.\r\n\r\nThe crown and sceptre of Rudolph II. may be seen here. They are also\r\nadorned with uncut diamonds and gems, and were formerly worn by the\r\nGerman emperors elect on their entrance into Frankfort.\r\n\r\nThe chains, collars, decorations, regalia, belonging to the dresses\r\nof the various Austrian Orders, namely, Golden Fleece, Maria Theresa,\r\netc., and worn by the Emperor, exhibit a splendid collection of\r\ndiamonds, topazes, emeralds, etc., unique in size and perfection.\r\n\r\nHere is also to be seen the famous yellow diamond known as the\r\nFlorentine. It is in the form of a double rose with facets cut all\r\naround, and weighs 139¹⁄₂ karats. It is of a fine lustre, but of\r\na yellow tinge, sufficient to impair the beauty of the prismatic\r\nreflections. The Emperor Francis, as Grand Duke of Tuscany, inherited\r\nthe gem, which accounts for its presence in Vienna.\r\n\r\nThis gem has been confounded with the diamond given to the Pope by\r\nCharles the Bold; but its history is very obscure, and its introduction\r\ninto Europe is unknown. There is, however, a story among the Italians\r\nthat it was first discovered by an amateur while hunting over the\r\nrelics and objects of virtu in a curiosity shop at Florence, where\r\nit was regarded as a crystal of yellow quartz. Tavernier saw it in\r\nFlorence in the middle of the seventeenth century, but does not mention\r\nits history. Besides this gem there are several large diamonds in\r\nEurope whose history has become very confused, and it is now difficult\r\nto trace their identity in several instances.\r\n\r\nThe Florentine is the rarest specimen of the kind known, and, although\r\nit is not cut with regularity, its lustre and its brilliancy are\r\ngreatly increased by its star-like cut. It is 1¹⁄₆ inches in length,\r\nby one inch wide, and is neatly set in a large _sevignée_, surrounded\r\nby other fine diamonds. Its value is placed at $450,000. There is also\r\nanother large and fine diamond intended as a button for a hat, but its\r\nhistory is unknown.\r\n\r\nThe finest rose-colored diamond known belongs to the Austrian jewels.\r\nIt is of a beautiful rose-color, thirty-two karats in weight, and of\r\nremarkable lustre. It is now placed in the centre of a knot of white\r\nbrilliants to which the decoration of the cross of Maria Theresa is\r\nattached. Here is also the beautiful bouquet of flowers made for Maria,\r\nand constructed out of colored diamonds and other precious stones.\r\n\r\nThe finest collection of colored diamonds in the world is to be seen\r\nhere. It was made by a Tyrolese named Helmreicher, who went to Brazil\r\nand spent the most of his life there in searching for them among\r\nthe different mines. They illustrate finely the wide range of color\r\npossessed by the gem.\r\n\r\nThe Empress of Austria, in 1800, during the war with France, wishing to\r\nemulate the manners of ancient warriors, sent to the Archduke Charles,\r\nthen in command of the army of Bohemia, a helmet set with magnificent\r\ngems.\r\n\r\nIn ancient times it was not rare for Eastern monarchs to array\r\nthemselves richly, which the stern Romans affected to despise,\r\nbelieving in the virtues of unadorned steel. The decorations of\r\nArtaxerxes Mnemon and Mithridates are said to have amounted to millions\r\nof dollars in value. It is also reported that Alexander, at the battle\r\nof Arbela, wore a helmet with a gorget of polished steel set with\r\ngems. Murat, however, the gayest of all modern generals, obtained his\r\npicturesque effects by means of colored fabrics and feathers rather\r\nthan from gold and gems.\r\n\r\nThere were few persons among the frequenters of the courts of Europe\r\nduring the past three-quarters of a century who had not heard of the\r\nvalue and the splendor of the Esterhazy jewels. It appears that near\r\nthe close of the last century Nicholas, Prince Esterhazy, assisted at\r\nthe crowning of Francis II. as King of Hungary. He was then captain\r\nof the Guard of Honor, which was composed of twenty-four nobles and\r\nprinces of inferior rank, and on this occasion first appeared in his\r\nornaments of precious stones. The Prince, not content with the usual\r\ndecorations belonging to his rank and his corps, transformed all parts\r\nof his equipments which were of metal into open gold-work incrusted\r\nwith gems. The effect was so beautiful as to stimulate the Prince\r\nto continue and complete his designs in a magnificent manner. And\r\ntherefore he sought far and wide for the finest gems to adorn his\r\nperson.\r\n\r\nThis passion for collecting and decorating soon ripened into a mania,\r\nand developed a prodigality greater than the Curii or Fabricii\r\never dreamed of. Ample means were at hand to foster this love of\r\nmagnificence, for the Prince was feudal proprietor of a third of\r\nHungary, being possessor of thirty-three manors, and lord of seventeen\r\ngrand seignories.\r\n\r\nThe uniform of his rank as general of Hungarian huzzars, composed\r\nof jacket, pelisse, and pantaloons, was woven with pearls of the\r\nfinest description; and among the multitudes of gems which formed the\r\ndecorations were fifty thousand fine diamonds of the brilliant form.\r\nThe weight of these mantles of magnificence was more than one man could\r\nendure for a length of time; and its profusion of ornament recalled the\r\nbarbaric splendor of Lollia Paulina as she appeared at the banquet of\r\nCaligula. Gems of all colors and varieties were employed by the Prince,\r\nand many fine rubies, emeralds, and topazes were made use of. The most\r\nvalued and the most delicately formed of all his ornaments was the\r\naigrette of diamonds which replaced the ordinary plumes on his huzzar\r\ncap. It was called the most beautiful jewel in the universe. These\r\nartificial plumes, which flashed like flames of fire, contained five\r\nthousand diamonds of the purest transparency and most beautiful colors.\r\nTheir weight amounted to one pound and a half avoirdupois. Around the\r\nhuzzar cap were placed a wreath and a band, over which were ranged, in\r\nmany rows, the finest and most brilliant pearls. The sword and scabbard\r\nwere incrusted with the rarest brilliants. The broad band which hung\r\nover the shoulder to the belt was a remarkable article of workmanship.\r\nIt was a simple band covered with fine pearls and the most precious\r\ndiamonds, one of which, at the shoulder, was valued at 20,000 livres\r\nand another at the waist at 12,000 livres. Besides these ornaments he\r\nhad for decorations six orders,--of the Toison d’Or, of the Bath, Saint\r\nAndrew, and others, all constructed of unequalled magnificence.\r\n\r\nThese costumes were worn by the Princes Nicholas and Paul at the\r\ncoronation of Francis II., of George IV., of William IV., of Victoria,\r\nand of the Emperors of Russia and Austria; and were the themes of\r\nadmiration, even among the glittering uniforms of higher ranks. But\r\nfinally, by the fatality that attends collections of all that is\r\nbeautiful on the earth, there came a change in the fortunes of the\r\nheir of Esterhazy. Paul, the last Prince, died some years ago harassed\r\nwith debts. His estates were hypothecated; but his jewels passed into\r\nthe hands of his creditors, and many of them were sent to London to\r\nbe separated and sold. Since then most of the beautiful gems, which\r\nsparkled so brilliantly in former times in the courts of Europe, have\r\nbeen scattered over the world, and their identity lost, their history\r\nforgotten.\r\n\r\nThere is a very beautiful diamond of thirty-six karats owned in\r\nHolland, but its history we have not learned.\r\n\r\nThe famous crown of St. Stephen of Hungary, which disappeared during\r\nthe Revolution of 1848, is said not to have any diamonds among its\r\ngems. Whether the absence of this stone is due to the extreme antiquity\r\nor to the whims of the constructors of the crown, we are unable to\r\nstate.\r\n\r\nThe late Duke of Brunswick had before his death a marvellous collection\r\nof diamonds, partly acquired in gratification of his eccentric tastes\r\nand partly obtained by inheritance. Among the latter was the famous\r\nCumberland diamond of thirty-two karats, which had descended to the\r\nheir of the House of Hanover. We have not been able to obtain a\r\ndescription of these treasures, nor can we learn of their disposition\r\nby the remarkable will of their late possessor.\r\n\r\nAmong the church regalia of Catholic Europe, and the offerings\r\npresented in past times to the various shrines of the saints of their\r\nreligion, are yet preserved many gems of great beauty and value, and\r\namong them a great number of diamonds. Some of them have been stripped\r\nduring the ravages of war, or by the iconoclastic fury of civil\r\ndisturbances; and the pious monks have, in instances, restored their\r\nloss by the substitution of paste, which has pleased the pilgrim’s eye\r\nquite as well. For instance, the celebrated shrine of the Three Magi at\r\nCologne has been despoiled of a great part of its vast treasures. And\r\nthe skulls of the kings, inscribed with their names--Gaspar, Melchior,\r\nand Balthazar--written in rubies, were once crowned with gold diadems,\r\nresplendent with brilliant gems, now replaced by silver, gilt, and\r\npaste, or imitations. The custodians of the relics and jewels still\r\nassert, through pious fraud or a convenient ignorance, that their value\r\namounts to 6,000,000 francs.\r\n\r\nCatholicism, when it had the means, spared no expense in decorating\r\nits shrines and beautifying its relics. It well understood the effect\r\nof the glitter of gold and the brilliancy of gems upon the human\r\nimagination. The examples of this barbaric and yet cultivated taste\r\nare to be seen in all parts of Europe. Relics and insignia were not\r\nonly lavishly adorned, like the Remonstrance at Prague with its 6,666\r\ndiamonds, but the bones of their saints were committed to the earth\r\nornamented with costly gems, like those of Cardinal Borromeo interred\r\nat Milan two hundred years ago. The shrine of Loretto in Italy has been\r\nthe most favored of all in Europe in attracting gifts from the rich\r\nand powerful as well as from the sick and the conscience-stricken. If\r\nreports are true, it has been and now is the receptacle of many of the\r\nmost beautiful treasures of the mineral kingdom. As its history is not\r\ngenerally known, we will briefly allude to it, and give a still briefer\r\ndescription of its jewels.\r\n\r\nCasa Santa denotes the chapel of the Holy Virgin at Loretto in Italy.\r\nIts chief room is the chamber in which the Blessed Virgin is said to\r\nhave been born, where she was betrothed to Joseph, where the angel\r\nsaluted her, and where the Holy Ghost overshadowed her, etc. Tradition\r\nsays it was carried, in May, 1291, through the air by angels from\r\nGalilee to Tersato in Dalmatia, and four and a half years afterwards\r\nwas taken to Italy and set down in a wood in the district of Recanati,\r\na thousand paces from the sea.\r\n\r\nStrange to relate, it was more than two hundred years before any author\r\nin that country took any notice of the event or of the building. It\r\nwas, when first brought to notice, simply a house of one room; but as\r\nreligious enthusiasm became excited it also became necessary to repair\r\nits decayed condition and improve its appearance. Therefore, Clement\r\nVII. caused a vaulted roof to be placed upon it and new foundations\r\nto support its tottering walls. At a later period it was completely\r\nencased in the finest Carrara marble, under the directions of the most\r\ncelebrated sculptors of the age and during the pontificates of Leo X.,\r\nPaul III., and Gregory XIII. The edifice which encloses the chamber\r\nwithin its spacious walls was designed by Bramante, and its sculptures\r\nwere designed and executed by the most famous artists. This is\r\ncomposed of Istrian stone resembling the Travertine stone so much used\r\nat Rome.\r\n\r\nWithin the ancient chamber, which is regarded as one of the holiest of\r\nall the holy precincts known, stands the sacred image, called the Great\r\nMadonna, five feet high, made of cedar, and carved, as tradition says,\r\nby St. Luke, who was a carver as well as a physician. Upon her head\r\nis placed a triple crown of gold, enriched with diamonds and pearls,\r\na gift from Louis XIII. of France. Over her shoulders an ample robe\r\nis cast, glittering with jewels of all descriptions and said to be of\r\ninestimable price.\r\n\r\nThe niche in which the image is placed is also decorated with gems,\r\nand among them are seventy-one of the finest of the Bohemian topazes\r\n[quartz].\r\n\r\nAdjoining the Virgin on the right side appears a statue of an angel\r\ncast in pure gold. This is also profusely enriched with diamonds and\r\nother gems. Some of these, which are said to have cost 50,000 ducats,\r\nwere the offering of Eleanora of the House of Este, the Queen of\r\nKing James II. of England, when she sought for the intercession of\r\nthe Virgin to grant her an heir. The Pretender to the British Crown\r\nwas born not long after, to the delight of all those who believed in\r\nmiraculous intervention.\r\n\r\nOn the left side of the Virgin a silver statue of an angel is placed,\r\nand still further on the right appears another costly image. This last\r\nwas the gift of Louis XIII. of France, in gratitude for the birth of\r\nthe Dauphin, afterwards “Le Grand Monarque,” Louis XIV.\r\n\r\nSeven lamps of solid gold are continually burning with a sacred flame\r\nbefore the image of the Virgin, and other parts of the room are\r\nilluminated with thirty-seven silver lamps.\r\n\r\nAlthough many of the reports concerning the valuables belonging to this\r\nfamous shrine are probably fiction, there is no doubt of the immense\r\nvalue of the gems and jewels that have been presented to it. The\r\ndonations to the wealth of this famous shrine have been given from all\r\nparts of the world where the Catholic religion has been venerated. And\r\nall classes, both rich and poor, have zealously invoked the blessing of\r\nthe mysterious spirit by their liberal bequests.\r\n\r\nThe rich Abbey of St. Denys, before the Revolution, is said to have\r\npossessed a rare and costly assemblage of gems, jewels, and jewelled\r\nrelics. They were reported to have been the accumulation of many\r\ncenturies, dating back to the Carlovingian kings.\r\n\r\nAmong them were said to have been valuable presents from the Emperors\r\nof Byzantium. But this is doubtful, for the Greeks despised Catholicism\r\nand the Crusaders. There may have been, and probably were, fine gems of\r\nvarious kinds from the spoils obtained by the Franks in the conquest\r\nof Constantinople. There is no doubt, however, as to the richness of\r\nthe works of mediæval art; for we find sufficient evidence in the old\r\nwork of Dom Doublet’s, “Tresor of St. Denys,” although the collection\r\nitself has long since been dispersed and almost forgotten.\r\n\r\nThe iconoclastic fury of the Revolution collected many of the treasures\r\nof this Abbey, with those of other chapels of Paris, and offered them\r\nat public sale in 1794. It is said that this collection embraced\r\na great quantity of precious stones,--rubies, topazes, sapphires,\r\netc.,--both in the rough crystal and rudely cut, thus proving their\r\nOriental origin. It is also stated that this much-to-be-lamented\r\nassemblage of beautiful things brought but 80,000 francs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\n                        CUTTING OF THE DIAMOND.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe art of polishing the diamond was discovered by man at an earlier\r\nage than history has generally ascribed to it. Positive evidence,\r\nhowever, is wanting as to exact dates; and the proof is chiefly\r\npresumptive. However, there is no doubt but that it was far anterior\r\nto the times when Berquen announced his improvements on the process.\r\nWe are quite willing to admit that the process of abrading the diamond\r\nagainst diamond was really discovered by the native of Bruges; but we\r\ncannot entertain the idea that the Hindoos were too stupid to pulverize\r\nthe diamond and use its powder in polishing the gems. The natives\r\nhad made use of powdered corundum in the earliest days, and it is\r\npreposterous not to admit they pulverized the diamond also.\r\n\r\nMost of the gems of antiquity, whether rubies or diamonds, are cut\r\nrudely; and often, with the latter gem, the natural faces of the\r\ncrystal are alone polished. Tavernier found that the native Hindoos\r\npolished the natural faces of the crystal if it was clear, and covered\r\nthe flawed and the defective with facets to disguise them. And so\r\ncommon was this practice, that the traveller was always suspicious of\r\nthe quality of the stone, whenever it was offered to him cut in this\r\nmanner.\r\n\r\nThe improvement with many of these diamonds is so slight, that we\r\nconsider the fact to be one of the reasons why certain natural\r\ncrystals, like those in the crown and clasp of Charlemagne, for\r\ninstance, were left in their rough state; the advantage derived from\r\ncutting not being equal to the time and labor expended.\r\n\r\nIt is true that we have no direct evidence of the cutting of the\r\ndiamond in ancient times, and those that have descended to us from\r\nundoubted early Roman periods are in the shape of natural crystals; but\r\nstill there is indirect testimony bearing in favor of the view.\r\n\r\nThe ancient gem engravers were wont to use splinters of broken\r\ndiamonds in their labors upon various kinds of gems; and they probably\r\npowdered the adamas, as well as varieties of corundum, for the purpose\r\nof polishing the hard stones. Scarcity of the mineral, rather than\r\nignorance of its properties, may have prevented its general use.\r\n\r\nJanon de St. Laurent, in his work on engraving tools, maintains that\r\nthe ancient instruments for the purpose of cutting gems were the same\r\nas the modern; and not only the wheel was used, but diamond dust was\r\nalso employed in the process. There is no doubt that the wheel and\r\nother tools were in use in Asia for a long period before their adoption\r\nby the nations on the Mediterranean. So far as we know, Persia was\r\nthe birthplace of gem engraving. Why are there not more examples of\r\npolished diamonds, if the process is so ancient? the reader may ask. We\r\nmay in part answer this question by saying, that the process of cutting\r\nregular facets on the gems was not early known, or the custom adopted;\r\nand, the polishing being so difficult, that the lapidaries were content\r\nto polish the natural faces only. Polished crystals of diamonds of this\r\ncharacter have descended to us from early times, and other examples are\r\nto be seen in ancient jewels. So little beauty was obtained by this\r\npolishing, that not much was gained in the vast labor required; and\r\nthe native crystals were often used without any aid from the lapidary.\r\nWe may see them in their rough crystalline forms in the crowns of\r\nthe Gothic princes, the Iron Crown of Italy, and the ornaments of\r\nCharlemagne, besides other relics of ancient and even mediæval times.\r\n\r\nThis custom of using the rough gems prevailed to some extent in recent\r\ntimes; and De Laet states that as late as the middle of the seventeenth\r\ncentury rough spinels were preferred to the cut for ornamentation.\r\nHowever, we will briefly allude to one or two instances in history,\r\nwhich lead the reader to infer that the diamond received a definite\r\npolish at an early day. Chrysostom, an authentic writer of the fourth\r\ncentury, in describing the magnificence of the Greek emperors at\r\nByzantium, mentions the dazzling splendor of the diamonds scintillating\r\nby agitation. If the historian does not use this description for the\r\ngems in general, we may infer that the diamonds had been polished;\r\nsince the unpolished stones do not exhibit much, if any, play of the\r\nprismatic hues. The maxim, “diamond cut diamond,” is of ancient origin,\r\nand may perhaps be referred to the saying in vogue among the Greeks\r\nas early as the seventh century, “that for the purpose of cutting\r\ndiamonds, a diamond was most effectual.”\r\n\r\nThe accounts of the Oriental historians concerning the fêtes of Timour\r\nin the fourteenth century, where diamonds were showered in profusion\r\nupon the guests, leave no doubts as to the art of polishing the gem as\r\nearly as that period.\r\n\r\nThe inventory of the _joyaux_ belonging to the Duc d’Anjou, in 1360,\r\nshows that diamonds were then cut, although rudely. It makes special\r\nmention of several diamonds, and one in particular set in a reliquary,\r\nand cut in escutcheon. Other polished diamonds are described in the\r\naccount given of the splendid entertainment given at the Louvre, by the\r\nDuke of Burgundy, to the King and Court of France.\r\n\r\nThere is also evidence to prove that diamond lapidaries were at work\r\nin Paris, when Berquen came to reside there. However, it was not until\r\n1475, after Berquen returned to his native city, Bruges, that the mode\r\nof polishing diamonds by direct abrasion became known in Europe. And\r\nwhen Charles the Bold intrusted the three famous gems to his skill,\r\nand rewarded him with 3,000 ducats for his labor, the name of Berquen\r\nbecame famous and widespread throughout Europe.\r\n\r\nNearly two centuries after this success, Cardinal Mazarin attempted\r\nto establish the business of diamond-cutting in Paris, and confided\r\nto the lapidaries he had invited to reside there, twelve of the\r\nfinest diamonds belonging to the Crown to be recut. These gems, from\r\ntheir beauty, and the circumstance of cutting, were called the twelve\r\nMazarins. History has neglected to record the fate of these magnificent\r\ngems save one. In the inventory of the French jewels in 1791, there\r\nis the solitary description, “the tenth Mazarin.” The others have\r\ndisappeared.\r\n\r\nThe Cardinal made every attempt to establish the favorite project\r\non a firm basis; but they were in vain; for the Dutch marine had\r\ncomplete control of most of the exports of India, and decided in favor\r\nof Amsterdam. Moreover, the establishment of the diamond trade in\r\nHolland was one of the indirect results of the revocation of the Edict\r\nof Nantes, and it was controlled by Israelite refugees from France.\r\nThe business gradually languished at Paris, and of the seventy-five\r\ndiamond-cutters of Mazarin’s industry, but five were left in 1775; and\r\nsoon after this, in spite of individual efforts and influences, it\r\nceased altogether. Even at the recent period of 1852, Paris did not\r\npossess a single diamond-cutter. At this time M. Philippe resolved\r\nto make the attempt to revive the good intentions of Mazarin, and has\r\nthus far succeeded well. But, in spite of all the English and French\r\nopposition, the diamond trade is still controlled by the Amsterdam\r\nJews, several thousand of whom are engaged in the business of cutting\r\nthe stones.\r\n\r\nDiamond-cutting was also practised to some extent in London during the\r\nlast century and the early part of this; but concerning it we have\r\nlearned but few particulars. It was conducted on strict mathematical\r\nprinciples, however; and the gems cut during this time in London are\r\neagerly sought for by amateurs, under the name of the “Old English\r\nStyle.” The brilliants of Ralph Potter, cut at the commencement of this\r\ncentury, are by far the finest exponents of the art as well as of the\r\nnatural powers of the gem. Since the discovery of the African mines the\r\nLondon establishments have been actively engaged, and we also learn\r\nthat branches of the business have been located in other cities of\r\nEngland.\r\n\r\nThe process of diamond-cutting is a very simple matter to those\r\nacquainted with the nature of the gem. To cut the facets, two stones\r\nare cemented on two sticks and rubbed against each other until a\r\nfacet is cut; then the position of one of the stones is changed, and\r\nanother flat surface cut. The process is thus continued until the gem\r\nis faceted all over, at the expense, however, of the other stone,\r\nwhich does most of the cutting. After the facets are cut, and a\r\ndefinite form given to the stone, the gem is placed in the hands of the\r\npolisher, who fastens it in solder, and then places it upon a small\r\nsteel disk which revolves horizontally with a rapidity of 1,500 to\r\n3,000 times a minute. This disk is moistened with diamond powder mixed\r\nwith oil, and one facet is polished at a time. The diamond-cutting\r\nproper is a rapid operation; but the polishing is slow and tedious. One\r\ncutter can generally furnish sufficient work for four or five polishers.\r\n\r\nThere are a number of forms adopted by the lapidaries for these gems,\r\nbut the two principal ones are the brilliant and the rose. The first\r\npattern, which was invented in Europe in the seventeenth century, is\r\nperhaps the best of all to call forth the powers of the gem. The second\r\nis of unknown age, and was practised by the Hindoos in ancient times.\r\nIt affords the largest beams of light for the weight, but it lacks in\r\ncolored reflections when compared with the brilliant.\r\n\r\nFor the perfection of the rainbow play of hues, it is essential that\r\nthe facets of the superior and inferior parts of the stone should\r\ncorrespond in exact proportions and at fixed distances, so as to\r\nmultiply the reflections and refractions, and produce the colors of the\r\nprismatic spectrum. Therefore the perfect cutting of the diamond is a\r\nmathematical problem, governed by rigid laws.\r\n\r\nAll limpid and white gems must be cut according to this rule, but in\r\ncase of colored stones the case is far different; for perfection\r\nof color is to be attained, and brilliancy is a secondary thought.\r\nTherefore a fine ruby or sapphire may be decidedly thin in form, and\r\nyet be a gem of great beauty and value. It is very rare we obtain\r\nthe full perfection of brilliancy and color in the colored gems; for\r\ngenerally the depth of the finest hues prevents a display of the\r\nrefractive powers of the stone.\r\n\r\nThe process of rifting diamonds by splitting them in their cleavage\r\nplanes was known long ago to the Hindoos; but, strange to say, it\r\nwas forgotten by modern lapidaries until revived by Wollaston not\r\nmany years ago. By this means masses of the crystal may be removed to\r\nescape a flaw or remove a spot, and yet preserve material that may be\r\nutilized, and which would have been lost by the process of grinding\r\naway the exterior.\r\n\r\nSome diamonds of the spheroidal form are deficient in cleavage\r\nplanes, and are quite impracticable for cutting; and the fact of the\r\nimpossibility of polishing them is sufficient proof of their peculiar\r\norigin, and that their form is not due to aqueous action.\r\n\r\nOthers, known as bort, seem to be of concentric arrangement, as though\r\ncrystallization radiated from the centre; and it is very difficult to\r\npolish them. The Hindoos avail themselves of this natural cleavage, and\r\nform table diamonds by adroitly striking along one of the planes of the\r\nstone with a sharp-edged tool, thereby separating the layers of the gem\r\nas the slate is rifted by the miner.\r\n\r\nThe operation, which seems so simple, really requires considerable\r\nskill and much of that acquired instinct or tact which is best\r\nexhibited by our Western Indians, who chip, with marvellous rapidity\r\nand certainty, a glass bottle into symmetrical arrow-heads. This method\r\nof reducing diamonds by cleavage was early known to the Hindoos, and\r\nis mentioned by Tavernier in an unmistakable manner in his published\r\ntravels.\r\n\r\nThe process of reduction by this means is very rapidly accomplished by\r\nthe skilful workman. At a glance he ascertains the direction of the\r\nlaminæ, which remind one of the layers of the onion, and then cuts\r\na small notch with another diamond in the place he selects. In this\r\nminute rift he places the edge of his blunt steel knife, and, tapping\r\nthe back of it with a light iron rod, the diamond is split with perfect\r\nease. By this process flaws and imperfections in the external layers of\r\nthe stone are removed without delay. In reducing the natural diamond\r\nto a regular form much of its substance is lost, and sometimes as much\r\nas one half of the weight of the stone. This loss, however, depends\r\ngreatly upon the natural form of the crystal. The perfect octahedrons\r\nlose but one fifth of their weight when transformed into the shape of\r\nthe brilliant; but the rhombohedrons lose over one third in taking the\r\nsame form.\r\n\r\nThe following will give the reader an idea of the losses of the rough\r\nstones when converted into fine gems. However, it must be remembered\r\nthat these great stones are generally of irregular shape and are\r\nrarely of fine crystalline forms. The Mogul weighed in the rough 780¹⁄₂\r\nkarats, but was reduced in cutting to 279⁹⁄₁₆ karats. The Regent\r\nweighed 410 karats, reduced to 136¹⁴⁄₁₆ karats. The Koh-i-noor weighed\r\n186¹⁄₂ karats, reduced to 102¹⁄₂. L’Etoile du Sud, 254¹⁄₂ karats,\r\nreduced to 124⁴⁄₁₆.\r\n\r\nThe process of cutting diamonds of large size is always attended\r\nwith risk, and is necessarily a costly operation. The Regent cost in\r\ncutting $25,000, and occupied two years’ time. The Star of the South,\r\nwhich was cut by Coster, occupied but ninety days, and the Koh-i-noor\r\nonly thirty-eight working days. This great feat in diamond-cutting\r\nwas performed by the ablest of the Holland lapidaries, with the aid\r\nof steam power. Although the time expended was less than forty days,\r\nyet the cost of cutting is said to have been $40,000, which sum was\r\nlessened by the sale of the rifted fragments.\r\n\r\nThe Oriental lapidaries, destitute of mechanical appliances of any\r\nconsiderable aid, consumed years in cutting some of the paragons of\r\nIndia. This condition of affairs will explain the reason why the\r\nArmenian lapidaries asked the immense sum of $80,000 to cut the slab of\r\ndiamond weighing 130 karats, which was captured by the Sultan of Persia\r\nat Coocha, in 1832.\r\n\r\nThe process of diamond-cutting has within a few years been established\r\nin the United States, and is due to the energy and superior inventive\r\ntalent of Mr. Henry D. Morse, of Boston. This gentleman conceived the\r\nidea of arranging a machine for the cutting and polishing of these\r\ngems, to enable the American jewellers to have their work performed at\r\nhome, instead of sending it to Europe.\r\n\r\nWhile engaged in perfecting his appliances, chance threw in his way\r\nan itinerant vendor of porcelain, who had in former years served as\r\nlaborer in the diamond ateliers of Amsterdam. The sight of the rough\r\ngems and the apparatus recalled to the Jew the scenes of his youth, and\r\nawakened a desire of renewing his former occupation; and he offered to\r\nperform the part of diamond-cutter. But, as the process was carefully\r\nconsidered, it was discovered that the Jew could only cut the facets\r\nof the diamond, and the art of the subsequent polishing he did not\r\nunderstand. It seemed strange that an artisan who possessed the rare\r\nability to tell at a glance how large a gem the stone would cut, how to\r\navoid internal imperfections, and how to take advantage of its cleavage\r\nplanes, could not polish the facets after he had cut them. But such was\r\nthe fact; for the two processes of cutting and polishing are widely\r\ndifferent, and require separate instruction. However, the deficiency\r\nwas soon supplied by an acquaintance, who was induced to leave Holland\r\nand act as polisher in the American diamond adventure.\r\n\r\nThe establishment was now complete, but the business was at first\r\nconfined to recutting and repolishing gems that had been damaged by\r\nlong use or accident. The inventive genius of Mr. Morse made several\r\nimportant changes in the machinery required by the lapidary, and\r\ndisplaced the rude and cumbersome apparatus of the old system. At first\r\nbut two or three men were employed; but after the discovery of the\r\nSouth African diamond mines, the rough gems imported to this country\r\nsoon furnished material for a more extensive establishment than was at\r\nfirst contemplated; and so the workshop was enlarged, and the workmen\r\nincreased, until twenty-four polishing wheels were put in operation\r\nby steam power, and a force of thirty persons employed in the various\r\nparts of the process. At first none but foreigners were employed in the\r\nlabor; but Mr. Morse believed that American ingenuity could master all\r\nthe difficulties of the process, and finally succeeded in educating\r\na corps of workmen who soon proved to be far superior to any of the\r\nartisans imported from the diamond-cutting establishments of Amsterdam.\r\nNow the atelier of Mr. Morse may be considered as essentially American\r\nboth in its artists and its arrangements.\r\n\r\nMany fine gems of large size have been polished by Mr. Morse, and among\r\nthem four of the great weight of fifty karats each. And very recently\r\nhe has ventured to attempt the cutting of a great diamond from South\r\nAfrica, weighing one hundred and twenty-five karats. The operation was\r\na successful one, and after three and a half months’ labor a beautiful\r\ngem of seventy-seven karats weight was obtained, which is greatly\r\nadmired by amateurs and experts, not only on account of the rare\r\nbeauty and perfection of the mineral itself, but also as a remarkable\r\nspecimen of workmanship in shaping its present form.\r\n\r\nThe process of cutting the diamond is divided at Amsterdam into several\r\ndistinct branches, and workmen are educated to perform one part, but\r\nnot another. Thus the cleaving, the cutting, and the polishing have\r\nspecial operators, who become expert in performing well the parts\r\nassigned to them without attempting the others.\r\n\r\nThis ceremony and care adopted by the Jews has undoubtedly produced\r\nskilful workmen; but we see no reason why all the parts may not be\r\nperfectly acquired by an intelligent mechanic. The art of cleavage,\r\nhowever, requires tact, and ought to include some knowledge of\r\nmineralogy.\r\n\r\nFor the particulars of the art of diamond-cutting, we will refer our\r\nreaders to the interesting chapters by Jeffries, Mawe, and Barbot; but\r\nwe will, however, briefly mention some of the forms adopted for the\r\ndiamond, and how they are produced.\r\n\r\nThe table and the rose patterns were the first regular forms adopted\r\nby the lapidaries. The first was simply the top of the stone ground\r\nflat with a corresponding flat bottom of less area, with its four upper\r\nand lower sides parallel to each other. As the light passed through\r\nthe stone without much refraction, the beauty of the mineral was not\r\ndeveloped by this pattern.\r\n\r\nIt has been stated that the rose shape was invented in Paris under the\r\nauspices of Cardinal Mazarin, but Tavernier describes the diamonds of\r\nAurungzeb of India as being of the rose-cut. Therefore we must give a\r\nmore ancient date to the pattern than Mazarin’s day. The form of the\r\nrose-cut is simply that of a hemisphere covered with small facets. Its\r\nflattened base is therefore admirably adapted for incrustation work,\r\nand the foil on which it is generally set serves as a refracting mirror\r\nfor the entering rays of light.\r\n\r\nThe rose pattern has several names which indicate the number of facets\r\nwhich they may bear. If it has but twelve or less facets it is called\r\nan Antwerp rose; if but eighteen or twenty it is a semi-Holland, and a\r\nHolland rose if it bears twenty-four facets. At the present time these\r\ngems are not in much demand, unless for incrustation work, for which\r\nthey are superior both in effect and in adaptability to the surface of\r\nthe object to be ornamented.\r\n\r\nThe form which appears to exhibit the splendors of the gem to the\r\nbest advantage is that known as the brilliant, and is rightly named\r\nfrom its effects. It was discovered in Italy in the latter part of\r\nthe seventeenth century by Peruzzi of Venice, which city was then one\r\nof the chief gem marts of the world. The conclusions which led to\r\nthe adoption of the shape were derived from experiments upon colored\r\nstones. This form of the brilliant is that of the ancient deep table\r\nmodified by receiving thirty-two facets above and twenty-four below its\r\ngirdle. The great relative depth of the gem, aided by the numerous\r\nfacets of the sides, appears to increase the natural refractive power\r\nof the stone by confining, as it were, the rays of light inside of it.\r\n\r\nAnother pattern, called the brilliolette, shows the beautiful qualities\r\nof the gem to great advantage. It is formed like two rose diamonds\r\njoined together at the base; or may be flattened and elongated like the\r\nalmond, and faceted all over with small facets. This is the form of the\r\nSancy, and should have been given to the Koh-i-noor and the Star of the\r\nSouth. The Austrian yellow diamond is of this pattern, and was probably\r\ncut in India, but when and where is still a mystery. And it is thought\r\nthat the famous twelve Mazarins were also cut after this shape.\r\n\r\nThe star pattern, which was invented by Caire, is but little used at\r\nthe present time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\n                     TESTING OF THE DIAMOND, ETC.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe testing of the diamond is generally an easy matter to the expert,\r\nbut the merchant and the amateur are often unable to decide quickly\r\nconcerning the character of a gem that may be offered to them. The\r\nlearned Abbé Haüy was often called in consultation upon matters of this\r\nkind, and even appeared in court as an expert of diamonds. Fortunately,\r\nthe methods of ascertaining the diamond beyond a doubt are now so easy\r\nand numerous that few attempts are made like those of the last century,\r\nwhen white topazes and zircons were sold or substituted for diamonds.\r\n\r\nWe may be permitted to say that the first and surest test of the\r\ngem is that of hardness, and that the diamond scratches all other\r\nsubstances with ease. The application of this test is not always made\r\nwith facility, but a little practice with a rough crystal of diamond\r\nwill soon enable the experimenter to perform it satisfactorily.\r\nIn performing the test for hardness for all gems it is well to be\r\nprovided with a fine English file, and splinters of quartz, topaz, and\r\nsapphire. The file, adroitly applied, will detect the character of gems\r\nbelow the quartz in hardness, and the splinters above mentioned will\r\ndetermine all others but the diamond.\r\n\r\nIn applying these tests, it is well to touch the middle of a facet, if\r\nthe gem be polished, and remember that the edges of many of the gems\r\nare very brittle. The diamond, for instance, although it is so very\r\nhard when its surface is directly tested, yet its thin edges, when cut\r\ninto a gem, are broken down with the greatest ease; therefore the test\r\nof hardness should be applied to the polished face of the stone.\r\n\r\nBut when the stone has been polished and set in such a manner that the\r\ntest of hardness cannot be easily applied, then the easiest method of\r\ndistinguishing its character is to expose it to the rays of artificial\r\nlight and observe their effects. If the stone, when placed at a certain\r\ndistance from the candle, flashes out the prismatic hues in a marked\r\nmanner, then the observer may safely conclude that the object is either\r\na diamond or one of the artificial gems known as strass. To distinguish\r\nthem by means of the eye alone will be a difficult task, for both\r\npossess very high refractive powers and exhibit remarkable displays\r\nof the prismatic hues; but the application of a fragment of diamond,\r\nsapphire, or topaz to the object will at once make known its character,\r\nand even the test of the steel file will betray the softness of the\r\nglass.\r\n\r\nThe transparent zircons closely approach the diamond in brilliancy,\r\nand are among the rarest of gems; in fact, a fine specimen of perfect\r\npurity would be worth more to the amateur than a diamond of equal\r\nweight. The pure yellow are declared by King to be among the rarest and\r\nmost beautiful of gems on account of their remarkable brilliancy and\r\nlustre. He also states that they are seldom found above two karats in\r\nweight.\r\n\r\nThe white zircon, which resembles the diamond so closely, is always\r\nminute and rarely above one karat in size. All that are known in\r\ncommerce come from Matura, in Ceylon, and are sometimes called Matura\r\ndiamonds. In times past they were in great demand for incrustation\r\nwork of watches and jewelry, for when cut in the form of roses and set\r\nupon brilliant foil they could not be easily detected by the eye from\r\nthe diamond. At the present day they are seldom seen in commerce, but\r\nwhether from scarcity, or from an improvement in the ideas of honor\r\nin the jewellers, we are unable to state. We know, however, that they\r\nare still mined by the natives of Ceylon, and are used in Asia for\r\nornamental purposes. The white spinel is sometimes mistaken for the\r\nadamas; but its inferiority in hardness and its want of the prismatic\r\nhues render its detection easy. The white topaz, when of two or three\r\nkarats weight, resembles the diamond in the rough very closely,\r\nespecially when in the modified or globular forms of crystallization.\r\nThe degree of specific gravity is exactly the same; but the test\r\nof hardness and the want of the prismatic display serve to dispel\r\nall doubts as to its nature. Neither of these gems, nor the white\r\nsapphire, has that peculiar sharp flash of the diamond which is known\r\nas the adamantine eclat. It has been stated by Hoppè that some of the\r\nBrazilian diamonds do not exhibit any more play of color when cut than\r\nrock crystal; but we have no doubt but that the writer is in error,\r\nand has probably been deceived by some of the white spinels or topazes\r\nwhich are sometimes found in the diamond mines of Brazil and are of\r\ngreat brilliancy.\r\n\r\nTo estimate the value of a rough diamond and ascertain its purity\r\nis often a difficult task, and one that requires both education and\r\ntact. For the surface of the natural gem, especially the modified and\r\nspheroidal crystals, is generally dull and chatoyant. This singular\r\nappearance, which has been erroneously represented as a thin crust, is\r\nin reality produced by the salient edges of the laminæ of which the\r\nstone is composed. The same or a similar effect may be artificially\r\nproduced in the polished diamond by heating it to a white heat, as has\r\nbeen seen in the diamonds injured in the great fires of Hamburg and\r\nChicago.\r\n\r\nBarbot, the French jeweller, declared that he had discovered a means\r\nby which the apparent rough, translucent coating could be changed into\r\nperfect transparency so as to give a clear view of the condition of the\r\ninterior. This statement, however, is very much doubted by lapidaries.\r\n\r\nWhen the rough diamond is placed in turpentine, alcohol, or even\r\nwater, it appears more transparent than before and like a bubble\r\nof air. We have therefore sometimes thought that Barbot had really\r\ndiscovered some fluid of high refractive power, immersed in which the\r\nrough diamond became transparent. For it is a well-established fact\r\nknown among chemists, that rough gems of a lower refractive power, like\r\nsapphire, chrysoberyl, spinel, etc., if placed in a fluid possessing\r\nan equal refractive energy, like that of muriate of antimony, become\r\nclear, and the observer is enabled to look through them. This discovery\r\nstrengthens Barbot’s statement and places it within the possibilities;\r\nbut as yet we know of no fluid that possesses a refractive power equal\r\nto the diamond. Topaz, emerald, and other gems of low refractive power\r\ncan be readily examined by using the oil of cassia, which has the\r\nrefractive energy of 1.64.\r\n\r\nThe rough diamonds often exhibit various colors, but generally of\r\nfaint tints. Sometimes the hue is not perfectly distributed throughout\r\nthe stone, but may be confined to a part of it, as in the sapphire,\r\nor even in one of its laminæ. It is a singular fact that the external\r\ncoverings of the mineral often contain the shades which render the\r\nrough gem of a disagreeable hue, and which may be made to disappear by\r\nthe process of cutting. Therefore, it sometimes requires experience\r\nand tact to determine the value of a rough diamond which possesses a\r\ndecided hue. However, those stones which exhibit a greenish or reddish\r\ncolor are considered safe stones for investment, and will develop\r\ninto superior gems after cutting. The bluish and the blackish are\r\nthought to be harder than the others; while the yellowish and grayish\r\ncolors indicate inferior stones. The brownish and yellowish hues may\r\ndisappear in process of cutting, but there is greater uncertainty in\r\nthese shades than in the others. Sometimes a stone which promises to\r\nyield a perfectly white gem, after cutting turns out to be of a decided\r\ndisagreeable tinge. Therefore the cutting of a rough diamond is often\r\nattended with some hazard.\r\n\r\nThe Hindoos have a practice of examining their stones before purchase\r\nby placing them in an aperture in the wall, with a lighted lamp in\r\nthe rear. And to ascertain their color they take them under the cover\r\nof a tree thick with foliage, where the verdure of the shade quickly\r\nreveals any other tinge, especially the bluish. It is quite difficult\r\nto distinguish the snow-white, except by contrast. The officers of\r\nthe Junta Diamontina, in Brazil, have a rough way of testing the\r\nnative diamonds from quartz, white topaz, and spinel, by rubbing them\r\ntogether close to the ear. The sharp tone which is thus produced is\r\ncharacteristic, but the test requires a keen and practised ear.\r\n\r\nSpecific gravity is one of the best tests for determining the nature\r\nof polished stones. By this means some of the precious minerals can be\r\ndetected with ease, like the zircon and the emerald, notwithstanding\r\ntheir color. But when applied to the diamond the experimenter should\r\nremember that its weight is exactly that of the white topaz; yet\r\nto distinguish them, the degree of hardness or the phenomena of\r\nelectricity will at once enable the expert to discriminate with ease\r\nand without a doubt. For the best methods of ascertaining the specific\r\ngravity of the stones, we must refer the reader to elementary works on\r\nchemistry and physics.\r\n\r\nThe test of its electrical phenomena is an important one, as one can\r\nthereby almost instantly detect it from other gems, especially the\r\nwhite topaz. When rubbed it exhibits vitreous electricity like glass,\r\nbut loses it in a very few moments.\r\n\r\nAnother curious phenomenon, called single refraction, enables the\r\nobserver to distinguish the mineral from all other gems except the\r\ngarnet and spinel, the others having double refraction, or, in other\r\nwords, giving a double image of a candle-light when it is viewed\r\nthrough their facets.\r\n\r\nFor the purpose of observing this phenomenon, Sir David Brewster\r\ninvented an instrument which he called a lithoscope. It consisted of a\r\nsmall glass prism which moved around a fixed joint so that the lower\r\nsurface of it could be laid upon the surface, or a facet of the stone\r\nto be examined. In this position, the two surfaces being parallel, the\r\nimage reflected from the lower surface of the prism would coincide with\r\nthat reflected from the surface of the stone. A drop of the oil of\r\ncassia or of sulphuret of carbon is placed between the prism and the\r\nfacet, and then the observer turns a screw to raise the prism a little\r\nround its joint. The effect of this is to separate the image of a light\r\nor a small luminous aperture as given by the prism from that given by\r\nthe facet; and the difference in the intensity and the color of these\r\ntwo images is an infallible indication of the nature of the stone. The\r\nimage from the diamond will be many times brighter than that reflected\r\nfrom the face of the prism when testing any of the other precious\r\nstones.\r\n\r\nA simpler mode is sometimes adopted by experts, but it requires some\r\ndexterity to exhibit the property. The method is this: the diamond is\r\nheld up to the eye, and a needle point or a small hole pierced in a\r\ncard is looked at. If the object is seen double, as if there were two\r\nneedle points or two holes, then the stone examined is not a diamond,\r\nas but one aperture should be seen.\r\n\r\nWith the aid of the tourmaline tongs, however, we have an easier\r\nmethod--subject to a few exceptions--of detecting the properties of\r\nrefraction of all gems even when they have been cut. The transparent\r\ntourmaline, when cut in thin plates parallel to the axes of its\r\nnatural crystals, possesses the strange and extraordinary power of\r\nextinguishing or causing to disappear one of the rays of polarized\r\nlight, while the other is preserved. Therefore, when a body possessing\r\nsingle refraction, although perfectly transparent, is placed between\r\nthe two thin slices of tourmaline composing the tourmaline tongs or\r\npolariscope, no light passes through; the instrument does not afford\r\nthe least glimmer of a ray of light. But when the transparent body\r\ninterposed in the polariscope is of double refraction, light passes\r\nthrough as if by magic.\r\n\r\nWhen the gem has been cut for ornamental purposes it is often difficult\r\nto adjust the faces of it to the plates of the polariscope. Then\r\nrecourse may be had to the use of a glass cell containing a fluid of a\r\nhigh refractive power, like the oil of cassia, turpentine, sulphuret\r\nof carbon, etc. The stone immersed in these fluids admits the light\r\nin all directions, and is then easily viewed through the plates of\r\nthe instrument. These fluids, however, are not of sufficiently high\r\nrefractive powers to do justice to the diamond and the zircon, but they\r\nanswer admirably for all gems of a less refractive power, like the\r\nvarieties of sapphire, spinel, topaz, garnet, tourmaline, emerald, etc.\r\n\r\nThe tourmaline tongs furnish the expert with a rapid and easy method\r\nof detecting many of the gems by reason of the phenomena of their\r\nrefraction. But the experimentalist must be on his guard lest he\r\npronounce substances to be of double when they really possess but\r\nsingle refraction. Glass has a tendency to crystalline regularity when\r\nheated and cooled suddenly, and may therefore acquire the property\r\nof polarizing the ray that passes the first plate of tourmaline and\r\ndispose of a part of that which passes the second. Certain minerals\r\nof the cubic system produce the same result by reason of a certain\r\nrare but forced arrangement; and some crystals, like the topaz, when\r\ncut in a certain direction to their optical axes cease to exhibit the\r\nphenomena of double refraction.\r\n\r\nOne of the chief tests used by the jewellers of olden times to\r\ndistinguish the diamond was the test of the tincture. This tincture was\r\na varnish made of ivory black and mastic, and when applied to the back\r\nof the diamond seemed to increase its lustre, while other gems were\r\nimpaired in their natural effects. Modern investigators, however, have\r\nshown that this procedure is a fallacious one, and is in reality one of\r\nthe absurd traditions which have been attached to the gem from early\r\ntimes, like some of the supposed spiritual properties.\r\n\r\nA perfect diamond must stand the tests for purity, faultlessness, and\r\ntransparency, and when these are carefully applied to the stone perfect\r\ngems will be found to be very rare.\r\n\r\nAs we have said before, the diamond is the foulest of gems, and is\r\nexceedingly liable to be injured by faults, such as are described\r\nin the technical terms of the jewellers as ashes, gray spots, rusty\r\nplaces, flaws, cavities, fissures, veins, feathers, foreign bodies,\r\nwavy and vitreous spots. Very few diamonds can stand the test of the\r\nmicroscope and be pronounced perfect. Still these microscopic faults\r\nare not to be considered in the commerce of the gem, but only in the\r\nstudy of its origin and nature. The jeweller may properly pronounce\r\nperfect the gem whose faults cannot be detected by the human eye. Even\r\nthe magnificent Regent has one small foul speck in it, according to\r\nJeffries; and Sir David Brewster found in the Koh-i-noor three specks,\r\nor rather cavities, in its central portion, which appeared to view in\r\nmore or less distinctness according as the light reached them.\r\n\r\nAfter a diamond has been cut it is not easy to ascertain its degree of\r\nperfection without careful examination, and this occupies considerable\r\ntime. And gems which appear at first glance to be pure and perfect are\r\noften found to be defective after examination.\r\n\r\nBabinet, of the French Institute, adopted the following method to study\r\nthe effects of the diamond, and it was his intention to apply the test\r\nduring his leisure moments to the principal diamonds in France; but\r\nother important labors diverted him from his purpose. He pierced a\r\nhole in a white card, a little larger than the diamond to be examined,\r\nand then passed a ray of sunlight or of the electric lamp through this\r\nhole. In the pathway of this ray, at a certain distance from the hole\r\nbehind the card, he placed the diamond so that the ray of light fell\r\nupon the anterior surface of the stone. The rays reflected from this\r\nanterior surface, or, in other words, the table of the diamond, and\r\nthose which pass through the stone are reflected back on the card,\r\nwhere they exhibit a white image of the table surrounded by small\r\nbands iridescent with the prismatic colors. By this simple method\r\nBabinet found that if the diamond had been well cut the colors were\r\nconsiderable in number, were well separated, and equally spread around\r\nthe white reflection of the table. As each of these bands indicates\r\none of the lustres of the stone, it is easy to estimate them both in\r\nnumber, quality, and symmetry. Therefore the observer can not only\r\ndetect the errors of the cutting of the gem, but decide upon the form\r\nbest adapted for the stone.\r\n\r\nThe term used to express the weight of the diamond and all the gems\r\nis derived from the word _Keration_, a kind of vetch, whose seeds,\r\nbeing generally of a uniform weight, furnished the Orientals with the\r\nmeans of estimating the value of precious stones. It is supposed to\r\nrepresent the equivalent of four Troy grains, but by actual measurement\r\nthe diamond karat weighs but 3¹⁄₃ Troy grains at the present day, and\r\nit may descend even lower in the scale, unless the unit be established\r\nby law. The history of the series of diminutions by which the karat\r\nhas reached its present weight is obscure, but as the term is supposed\r\nto represent four Troy grains it should equal them in reality. That\r\nit is a mere conventional weight is shown by its variance in European\r\ncountries, as well as in the gem-producing countries of Asia. In\r\nmaking use of the term to express the weight of precious stones we\r\nwould suggest that it be written karat, as more in accordance with\r\nits derivation, and that the commonly accepted word carat be used when\r\nwe wish to define the alloy of certain metals, like that of gold and\r\nsilver coins.\r\n\r\nBefore proceeding to the subject of the valuation of diamonds, we\r\nwill say a few words concerning the imitations produced by the skill\r\nof man. Many attempts at imitating the diamond have been made by\r\nexperimentalists for a long time past, and much ingenuity shown by\r\nthem. To those of our readers who desire to study especially these\r\nexperiments we will refer them to the works of Silliman, Hare, Latour,\r\nSaix, Despretz, Dumas, Ebleman and Gaudin, Mohler, St. Clair, Deville,\r\nGaunal, Becquerel, Joyce, Cagnard de la Tour, Mactear, Hannay, and many\r\nother well-known experimenters.\r\n\r\nDespretz’s experiments, which were based upon certain combinations\r\nof carbon, are deserving of mention. The chemists have discovered\r\nthat in combining sulphur and carbon a colorless liquid is produced\r\nresembling water, and apparently containing nothing but sulphur and\r\ncarbon. Therefore, Despretz reasoned, if he could get rid of the\r\nsulphur by some manner, the carbon might be crystallized. And to\r\nobtain this result, the action of the volcanic battery offered the\r\nmost plausible means. With the aid of this battery the experimenter\r\nreally succeeded in obtaining on a thread of platina, passed through a\r\nsolution containing carbon, some small crystalline depositions, which\r\nby their form and hardness seemed to be embryonic diamonds. But here\r\nthe experiment ended. Nature refused to reveal her secrets.\r\n\r\nThe alchemists of the Middle Ages seeking the transformation of gold\r\nfrom baser metals, have been well represented by the chemists of the\r\npresent century attempting to imitate the diamond. Philosophy and\r\nscience have united their efforts in these fascinating experiments; but\r\nNature still defies the most determined efforts of art in respect to\r\nthe reproduction of the diamond.\r\n\r\nThe mineral appears to be an allotropic form of a simple elementary\r\nbody which Nature offers to us with lavish hand. And when we consider\r\nthe triumphs of chemistry, the process of transforming this element\r\ninto the coveted form does not seem to be so very difficult to the\r\ncasual thinker. But Nature is stubborn in revealing her simple acts.\r\nHowever, we are not without faith in these determined efforts of\r\nscientific skill; for we know that art now produces the brother of\r\nthe diamond, graphite, at will. And we see that at the soda works at\r\nAussig this form of carbon is obtained as a secondary product by the\r\ndecomposition of cyanogen and its combinations. We do not, however,\r\nlook forward with much pleasure to the realization of this idea; for\r\nsuccess in producing the diamond will annihilate at a single blow an\r\nimportant article of commerce, and rob ornamentation and investment of\r\none of its most desired objects.\r\n\r\nArt, however, in its researches on this subject, has succeeded in\r\nproducing a glass which, when cut, approaches very closely the\r\nbrilliancy and prismatic display of the diamond. The artificial gems\r\nmade from this glass, which is supposed to have thallium as a base,\r\ninstead of lead, are really superior examples of art. “Nothing but\r\nglass,” is a phrase too often used contemptuously and unjustly; for\r\nthese imitations are quite as charming as the adamas itself. In the\r\nflash of their rainbow hues, they surpass some of the great diamonds,\r\nlike the Koh-i-noor; and in brilliancy they exceed all other gems.\r\nTheir refraction reaches 2 on the established scale, while that of the\r\ndiamond is reckoned at 2.4, and that of the sapphire, 1.79. They lack,\r\nhowever, hardness; and the effect of time dims their lustre. But this\r\ndefect may yet be remedied; for the ancients made glass quite as hard\r\nas quartz. And when we come to examine those wonderful specimens of\r\nancient glass, with their exquisite colorings, exhumed by General Di\r\nCesnola in the Phœnician tombs of Cyprus, who will venture to establish\r\na limit to the art of glass-making? Even within the past few years, a\r\nprocess has been discovered by which the elasticity and hardness of\r\nglass have been increased to a remarkable degree; and if the defect of\r\nbrittleness can be overcome, a new era in glass-making will have been\r\nreached.\r\n\r\nArtificial diamonds are often worn at the present day; and the fair\r\nwearer consoles herself with the hope that, when sunnier days come,\r\nthe artificial will give place to the real. It will not be soon\r\nforgotten by the votaries of fashion, that the Duchesse de Berri,\r\narriving in France, received for her bridal ornaments only the\r\nimitation, and that she wore them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\n                         VALUE OF THE DIAMOND.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe history of the commercial value of the diamond, extending back\r\nto a distant period of time, forms an interesting chapter for the\r\nphilosopher as well as the merchant. It would appear that the gem had\r\nbeen comparatively independent of the caprice of fashion, and that it\r\nhas had for many years a value quite as fixed as gold or silver. This\r\ncomparative valuation only applies to the snow-white diamonds, and to\r\nthose whose imperfections are not readily discernible to the naked eye.\r\n\r\nIn estimating the value of diamonds, Barbot divides their shades into\r\nfifteen degrees, as follows: In the first degree he places the rare\r\ndiamonds which exhibit the vivid gleam like the flash of polished\r\nsteel; second degree, snow-white, first water; third degree, white,\r\nfirst water; fourth degree, white, with faint shades, red, yellow,\r\nand blue; fifth degree, white, yellow, or green, second water; sixth\r\ndegree, grayish-yellow or green, second water; seventh degree, orange\r\nyellow; eighth degree, translucent topaz yellow; ninth degree,\r\ntranslucent deep green; tenth degree, translucent brick-red; eleventh\r\ndegree, translucent deep red; twelfth degree, quite opaque, dingy blue;\r\nthirteenth degree, quite opaque, deep bottle green; fourteenth degree,\r\nquite opaque, brown or blackish; fifteenth degree, quite opaque, black\r\nas jet.\r\n\r\nIn ancient times, the gem probably had no fixed commercial value,\r\nand was sought for as a curiosity or as a talisman. In the fifteenth\r\nand sixteenth centuries, the goldsmiths of Italy, which was then the\r\nrichest country in the world, established a comparative valuation for\r\nthe four precious stones, ruby, emerald, diamond, and sapphire. From\r\nthese accounts we learn that the diamond of one karat was valued at\r\n100 gold scudi, and that the emerald was estimated at 400, and the red\r\nsapphire, or ruby, at 800, or eight times the price of the adamas.\r\nThese valuations, if we estimate the scudi at nine English shillings,\r\nmake a diamond of one karat worth $225, and the ruby of the same weight\r\nat $1,800, or nearly two thousand dollars, a statement which is quite\r\nincredible.\r\n\r\nIn the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries and even before these dates,\r\nVenice was the chief gem mart of Europe. Her merchants had control of\r\na great part of the trade with the Eastern countries; and most of the\r\nOriental luxuries passed through their hands. From the account of the\r\nauction sale, in the year 1606, of the effects of a diamond merchant\r\nin that city, we learn the value of diamonds of one karat weight at\r\nthat time. They were then valued at £21 13_s._ 4_d._, which was an\r\nenormous sum, compared with the value of money at the present day.\r\n\r\nIn 1750, the price of the stone in Europe was $40 for one-karat gems.\r\nThis was just before the discovery of the Brazilian mines. The sudden\r\ninflux of the gems reduced the price shortly after to $5 per karat;\r\nbut the market soon recovered from the panic, and in 1791, at the time\r\nthe inventory of the French jewels was made, the price had arisen to\r\n$30 for the same class of diamonds. Since this period, the prices have\r\nvaried, from the influences of the wars of Europe, sinking at the time\r\nof the disturbances of the Revolution of 1848, to $20 and $25 per\r\nkarat. But after the year 1850, the price of the gem steadily advanced,\r\nand in 1865, its quotations were almost the same as that of Venice in\r\n1606. This comparison, however, should not be made without remembering\r\nthe vast difference in the value of money of the two periods.\r\n\r\nThe valuations of the diamond for more than a century past have been\r\nbased upon the form of the brilliant, while those of the star, table,\r\nrose, and others, have been valued at lesser and sometimes almost\r\nnominal prices.\r\n\r\nThe price of the rose diamonds has been affected by the views of\r\nfashion for a long time, and at the present day we are unable to\r\nestablish any fixed scale. We will, however, append the views of some\r\nof the gem experts as to the valuation of this pattern, during the past\r\ntwo centuries.\r\n\r\nRobert de Berquen, in 1669, valued the rose cut\r\n\r\n  of  1 karat at   100 francs.\r\n  ”   2   ”   ”    500   ”\r\n  ”   4   ”   ”  1,500   ”\r\n  ”   8   ”   ”  6,000   ”\r\n  ”  10   ”   ”  9,000   ”\r\n\r\nThis estimate, however, was not founded upon any principle; and it was\r\nnot until the celebrated Tavernier formed his rule for the valuation of\r\nthe rose cut, that the diamond had any definite value. Tavernier, in\r\n1692, took for an example a rose of one karat, of fine water, white,\r\nand of good form, and fixed the valuation at 150 francs, and for gems\r\nof greater weight multiplied this figure by the square of their weight.\r\nThe justly celebrated jeweller and traveller also followed the same\r\nrule with fine diamonds that were not of regular form. The brilliant\r\ncut was not then known.\r\n\r\nIn 1858, in France, the comparative values were: for one karat, fine\r\nbrilliant cut, 300 francs; for one karat, fine rose cut, 200 francs.\r\n\r\nThe following list has been kindly furnished me by Henry D. Morse,\r\nEsq., of Boston, as giving the value of diamonds in the United States\r\nat the present time, January, 1884. The prices have fluctuated\r\nconsiderably during the past year, and the estimates given are\r\nwholesale prices, and regarded as being quite low for fine stones:--\r\n\r\n  Lots averaging   ¹⁄₂ karat each,   $60 per karat.\r\n   ”       ”       ³⁄₄   ”     ”      80  ”    ”\r\n   ”       ”     1       ”     ”     100  ”    ”\r\n   ”       ”     1¹⁄₄   ”     ”     110  ”    ”\r\n   ”       ”     1¹⁄₂   ”     ”     125  ”    ”\r\n   ”       ”     1³⁄₄   ”     ”     145  ”    ”\r\n   ”       ”     2       ”     ”     175  ”    ”\r\n\r\nAbove two karats the prices are not much increased per karat, because\r\nof their not being as much in demand. Stones of five karats and\r\nupwards, being very slow to sell, at the present time can be bought at\r\n$175 to $200 per karat, of the same qualities as the two-karat stones\r\nquoted above. Very extra white perfect stones, when well cut, bring,\r\nwhen sold singly or few at a time, from 20 to 25 per cent more than the\r\nprices quoted. The lower grades of stones are generally sold in lots,\r\nand the sizes do not make much difference in price. The larger they are\r\nthe less desirable, and oftentimes stones of from five to ten karats\r\nare sold cheaper than stones of one to two karats; the price depending\r\nupon the shade of color and skill in cutting. Lots of this description\r\ncan be bought for from $75 to $90 per karat. If the tinge is a little\r\nmore decided they will bring but $60 per karat. The yellow diamonds\r\neven ranging as high as ten to twenty karats bring about $45 per karat.\r\nFlawy stones bring from $15 to $35 per karat, according to their color,\r\nsize, and brilliancy. Fine rough stones of assorted sizes, varying\r\nfrom three to ten karats, bring from $30 to $45 per karat according to\r\ntheir shape and perfection. Smaller sizes are reckoned in value from\r\n$15 to $20 per karat. Cheaper grades and off-colored crystals are sold\r\nas low as $8 to $12 per karat. The bort diamonds vary in value; those\r\ncoming from Africa bring but $1.50 per karat, while the same variety\r\nfound in Brazil bring $6. The carbon variety of the best sizes bring\r\nabout $20 per karat. Fifteen years ago the same mineral could be bought\r\nfor $2.50 per karat; while the Brazilian bort was quoted at $9.\r\n\r\nOf colored diamonds, those slightly tinged with various colors,\r\nespecially the yellow and brown, were valued in London and Amsterdam,\r\nin 1872, as follows:--\r\n\r\n  Under 1  karat   30s. to  £2 10s. per karat.\r\n   1 to 2    ”     40   ”    4 10    ”    ”\r\n   2 ”  3    ”     £3   ”    5 10    ”    ”\r\n\r\nThe following account of Cape of Good Hope diamonds which were sold by\r\nauction at Covent Garden, February, 1872, may interest the reader in\r\ncomparison with other sales at various periods of time:--\r\n\r\nOne white rough diamond, 9¹⁄₂ karats, £60; one slightly off color, 7¹⁄₄\r\nkarats, £37; a curious cabinet specimen of native diamond in matrix,\r\n£14, one large rough gem, drop shape, 14¹⁄₂ karats, £42. Among the cut\r\ndiamonds the following were sold: a magnificent brilliant, 8 karats,\r\n430 guineas; a fine yellow brilliant of great lustre, 7¹⁄₂ karats,\r\n140 guineas; a brilliant of great spread and good water, about 7¹⁄₂\r\nkarats, 140 guineas; a large, lustrous brilliant of fine color weighing\r\nabout 7 karats, 480 guineas; a court tiara of five graduated brilliant\r\nstars, 185 guineas; a brilliant necklace of forty graduated collets,\r\n£300.\r\n\r\nThe following sale by auction, in London, of some of the Imperial\r\njewels belonging to the Empress Eugenie, may also interest the reader;\r\nand we have therefore thought proper to insert the account. It took\r\nplace in July, 1872, at the rooms of Christie, Manson, & Co.:--\r\n\r\nLots 16 and 17.

Yet the\r\nrequirements of society and the arts are so vast that the gem\r\napparently seems to be a rare stone, while in reality it ranks low down\r\nin the scale of rarity.\r\n\r\nAlthough we believe that there are immense diamond placers yet to be\r\ndiscovered in Africa, Asia, and America, we do not think that the gem\r\nwill ever lose its high rank in the wants of fashion and ornamentation,\r\nor that its price will ever again descend to the valuation of 1848\r\nexcept in transient times of far-extended commercial distress. The\r\nmisfortunes of any one country will not affect the established price to\r\nany great extent, since the demand from other countries is so great as\r\nto preserve a well-marked equilibrium.\r\n\r\nIndia, with its millions of people who prefer to invest their gains in\r\na gem to all other known property, will furnish an eager market for the\r\ndiamond for many ages to come. The history of the influx and absorption\r\nof silver by that country furnishes an interesting parallelism.\r\n\r\nMost of the people of the earth entertain superstitious fancies, and\r\nespecially invest the gems with spiritual powers or special attributes.\r\nHence the innate love of ornament, combined with the desire of\r\npossessing a rare treasure, will always give to the gems a prestige\r\nand a commercial value above all other things. Puritanical morality\r\nmay rail against the gems as luxuries; but the nature of man must be\r\nchanged before these ideas can be universally adopted. The refinements\r\nof civilization, as well as the follies of barbaric ages, call for\r\nthe ornamentation of jewels and gems. And modern economy may, with\r\nTiberius, complain in vain of that “rage for jewels and precious stones\r\nwhich drains the empire of its wealth, and sends, in exchange for its\r\nbaubles, the money of the commonwealth to foreign nations.”\r\n\r\nA brilliant writer has lately stated that “Pictures, gems, china,\r\nbronzes, _bric-à-brac_ of every sort, rare shawls, rare engravings,\r\nand even rare fruits, flowers, and dogs are steadily tending upwards\r\nin value, as if their price depended upon a want and not a caprice. It\r\nis the most curious illustration of the unchangeableness of the law\r\nwhich governs even caprices that we are acquainted with; and tends to\r\nindicate that the desire for the rare, which we all notice and smile\r\nat, in bibliopoles, antiquarians, entomologists, and every variety\r\nof the genus collector, is not an exceptionable eccentricity, but a\r\npermanent attribute of the human mind, though only noticed in those who\r\nhave wealth to indulge in some unusual or splendid form. It is like the\r\ndesire of accumulation, one of the passions, and not one of the mere\r\ntastes of men; and may be relied on in business, almost as certainly as\r\nself-interest, vanity, or ambition.”\r\n\r\nThe relative worth of the diamond has never been better described than\r\nby the following lines from the pen of an able English author:--\r\n\r\n “It is in truth the very essence of property. It is riches condensed\r\n and wealth secured; too small to be seen by the midnight burglar; too\r\n easily hid to be seized by the tyrant; and too quickly carried away to\r\n be wrested from the patriot exile or torn from the hunted outlaw. In\r\n vain would the vanquished monarch strive to remove his bags of gold,\r\n or transport his territorial domains; but a diamond is an empire made\r\n portable, with which he might purchase a better kingdom, and mount a\r\n prouder throne. Had the treasure of Crœsus been invested in brilliants\r\n he might have founded a nobler Lydia beyond the reach of his Persian\r\n invader.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             THE EMERALD.\r\n\r\n  “The emerald burns intensely bright,\r\n  With radiance of an olive light;\r\n  This is the faith that highest shines,\r\n  No need of charity declines,\r\n  And seeks no rest and shuns no strife,\r\n  In working out a holy life.”\r\n\r\n  MARBODEUS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             THE EMERALD.\r\n\r\n\r\nDutens and several others who have written upon gems and precious\r\nstones during the last two centuries, have asserted that the ancients\r\nwere unacquainted with the true emerald, and that Heliodorus, when\r\nspeaking nearly two thousand years ago of “gems green as a meadow in\r\nthe spring,” or Pliny, when describing stone of a “soft green lustre,”\r\nreferred to the peridot, the plasma, the malachite, or the far rarer\r\ngem, the green sapphire. But the antiquary has come to the rescue with\r\nthe treasures of the despoiled mounds of Tuscany, the exposed ashes of\r\nHerculaneum and Pompeii, and now exhibits emeralds which were mounted\r\nin gold two thousand years before Columbus dreamed of the New World, or\r\nPizarro and his remorseless band gathered the precious stones by the\r\nhundred-weight from the spoils of Peru.\r\n\r\nAlthough these specimens of antique jewelry set with emeralds may be\r\nnumbered by the score or more in the museums and reliquaries of Europe,\r\nbut very few engraved emeralds have descended to us from ancient times.\r\nThis rarity is not due to the hardness of the stone, for the ancient\r\nlapidaries cut the difficult and still harder sapphire; therefore we\r\nmust believe the statement of the early gem-writers that the emerald\r\nwas exempted from the glyptic art by common consent on account of its\r\nbeauty and costliness.\r\n\r\nStones possessing a green color have been used for ornamental purposes\r\nfrom the very earliest periods of the social life of man. And as we\r\nreview the archæological history of the human race, it would seem as\r\nthough minerals of this hue had been especially selected among all\r\nothers for ornamental purposes.\r\n\r\nFor instances of this primitive selection, we will refer to the green\r\nstone hatchets found among the ancient tombs of Brittany; the axe heads\r\nof jade in New Caledonia; the green serpentine implements of Africa;\r\nthe articles carved from green zoisite, revered among the Chinese from\r\ntime immemorial; as well as the green jade and amazon stones, which\r\nthe Mexicans wrought with wondrous skill into strange and grotesque\r\nforms, and which they prized above even their magnificent and matchless\r\nemeralds. It is also clearly evident that the emerald was discovered in\r\nvery ancient times, and that it was early adopted in ornamentation, and\r\nwas prized as among the most valuable of the gems, if not the highest\r\nin estimation, for its color and fancied virtues.\r\n\r\nPliny was undoubtedly familiar with the true emerald, and expressed\r\nhis satisfaction in the following language:--\r\n\r\n “There is no color so pleasing to the eye as that of the emerald.\r\n Whoever delights in the verdure of herb and leaf must enjoy infinitely\r\n more the contemplation of emeralds; for no verdure can compare to\r\n theirs. They are the only stones that charm the eye without wearying\r\n it. It loses its lustre neither in sun nor in shade, nor in artificial\r\n light. It shines continually with the same soft glow.”\r\n\r\nIn the time of Alexander, the emblems of authority of the Persians\r\nconsisted of golden imitations of vines, loaded with clusters of\r\nemeralds, carbuncles, and other gems. At the famous marriage feast\r\nof Alexander and his eighty companions with their beautiful Persian\r\nbrides, emeralds appear to have been the favorite gem used, and to have\r\nbeen esteemed above all other ornaments except the beautiful pearls of\r\nthe Persian Gulf.\r\n\r\nIn ancient times this gem was not only prized as an ornament, but also\r\nas a talisman, and even as a medicine in the powdered state. Its beauty\r\ncaptivated the vain and frivolous, and its supposed virtues endeared\r\nit to the rich and the wise. It was supposed to exercise a good effect\r\nupon the eyesight; hence it was worn as a seal to be looked at; when\r\nworn as an amulet it endowed the wearer with courage, drove away evil\r\nspirits, assuaged terror, and prevented attacks of epilepsy.\r\n\r\nPliny states that Paulina, at the Banquet, was literally covered with\r\nemeralds and pearls, arranged over her dress in alternate rows.\r\n\r\nThe famous and fatal ring which Polycrates cast into the sea, as an\r\noffering to the gods in return for forty years of prosperity, was set\r\nwith a beautiful emerald.\r\n\r\nThe ancient Etruscans carved the emerald at a very remote period, and\r\nthe fact is proven by the scarabeus in the Townley collection.\r\n\r\nThe Castellani collection exhibits ear-rings of gold set with pendants\r\nof emeralds which were found in the tombs at Bolsena.\r\n\r\nIn the Devonshire gems there is a large emerald cut into a Gorgon’s\r\nhead, in high relief,--evidently a gem of great antiquity and of\r\nexceeding value at the time of its conversion into a work of art.\r\n\r\nWithin the sarcophagus of Maria Honorii fifty rings set with different\r\nstones were found, and among them an emerald set in gold and engraved\r\nwith a head supposed to be that of Honorius himself. It was probably\r\nfashioned for a royal signet and buried with the remains of its owner.\r\n\r\nThe famous mirror or lens, in or through which the cruel and\r\nnear-sighted Nero was wont to view the bloody combats in the arena at\r\nRome, is supposed to have been cut from an emerald; but it was probably\r\na lens cut from green glass.\r\n\r\nIt appears, however, from the researches of the antiquaries, that the\r\ngem was very rare until the Imperial epoch, when they were introduced\r\nfrom Asia and other countries in accordance with the luxury and\r\nextravagance of the age. Castellani’s collection displays some fine\r\nexamples of the jewelry of this period set with emeralds. Among them\r\nthere is a beautiful necklace formed of sixteen natural crystals of\r\nemerald fastened in gold; and also another composed of ten natural\r\ncrystals of emerald set in double chains of gold. Among the engraved\r\ngems may be seen an emerald intaglio, representing a Nereid on a sea\r\nbull, and two other intaglios of beryl, with pictures of Mars, and a\r\nportrait of Julia Paula.\r\n\r\nFrom the earliest times of history monarchs and potentates of all\r\nranks and races, from Solomon to Montezuma, were wont to wear signet\r\nrings, which were sometimes engraved, and were then often used to\r\nimpart authority either by the exhibition of the ring itself, or its\r\nimpression upon papyrus, parchment, or wax. The most celebrated ring of\r\nthis description we have any authentic knowledge of, was that formed\r\nof a large emerald set in gold and worn by Alexander the Great, whose\r\nportrait was engraved upon the stone. The hero, when dying, bestowed it\r\nupon his favorite general, Perdiccas, and thereby invested him with the\r\nauthority of succession. History refuses to make known the fate of this\r\nsplendid gem. It is probable that Ptolemy Soter obtained possession\r\nof it when Perdiccas was slain in Egypt, and that eventually Augustus\r\nCæsar may have worn it for his first imperial seal, which was an\r\nemerald engraved with the head of Alexander.\r\n\r\nAfter the death of Pompey in Egypt, his seal ring, which represented\r\na lion holding a sword in his paw, was taken to Rome and presented\r\nto Cæsar, who burst into tears on receiving the signet of his former\r\nassociate and unfortunate rival.\r\n\r\nThe practice of interring with the dead some of the jewels worn in\r\nlife, has been practised in recent times. When Cardinal Borromeo was\r\nburied at Milan two hundred years ago or more, a large gold cross,\r\ncontaining seven large and fine emeralds surrounded with diamonds, was\r\nplaced in his tomb. When Lord Palmerston was buried at Westminster\r\nAbbey, the officiating clergyman threw into the grave several diamond\r\nand gold rings as a peace offering. In ancient times the custom was\r\nof frequent occurrence, and to this habit we owe the preservation of\r\nmany beautiful gems and jewels, which have in this manner escaped the\r\npillage and fury of thieves and iconoclasts.\r\n\r\nThe mineral has borne the name of emerald since the middle of the\r\nseventeenth century, at which time it was adopted by the mineralogist,\r\nWallerius. But whence it is derived, and on what particular grounds, we\r\nare not informed. In Asia, in ancient times, it was described under the\r\nSanskrit name, “marakat,” which is connected with “esmark,” signifying\r\na sea monster, or “makara,” meaning the sea. As it passed westward,\r\namong the Persians it became “zabargat,” and still farther on its\r\njourney it was changed by the Greeks and Latins into “smaragdus.” The\r\nderivation of its ancient terms is also exemplified by the use or\r\npurposes in which the gem and its varieties were used. It was therefore\r\nfrequently chosen by the antique gem cutters and engravers, as the\r\nproper material for the representation of all maritime subjects or any\r\nallusions to the sea gods.\r\n\r\nThe emerald is now one of the rarest of gems; and its scarcity gives\r\nrise to the inquiry as to what has become of the abundant shower of\r\nemeralds which fairly rained upon Spain during the early days of the\r\nconquest of Mexico and Peru, bringing down the value of fine stones to\r\na trifling price. As with all commercial articles, there is a waste and\r\nloss to be accounted for during the wear of three centuries; but this\r\nalone will not explain their present rarity in civilized countries.\r\nEven in the times of Charles II., when the destitution of the country\r\nwas extreme, the Dukes of Infantado and Albuquerque had millions in\r\ndiamonds, rubies, and precious stones, yet hardly possessed a single\r\nsou. So impoverished was the land, and so slender were the purses of\r\nall, that the Duke of Albuquerque dined on an egg and a pigeon, yet it\r\nrequired six weeks to make an inventory of his plate. At this period,\r\nwhen the nobles gave fêtes the lamps were often decorated with emeralds\r\nand the ceilings garlanded with precious stones. The women fairly\r\nblazed with sparkling gems of fabulous value, while the country was\r\nstarving. Most, if not all, of this missing treasure was transferred\r\nto Asia, and with the silver current which flowed steadily from the\r\nSpanish coffers into India went many of the emeralds also; for in those\r\nregions this gem is regarded as a foreign stone, and the natives,\r\ninvesting it with the possession of certain talismanic properties,\r\nprize it above all earthly treasures.\r\n\r\nWhen the Spaniards commenced their march toward the capital of Mexico,\r\nthey were astonished at the magnificence of the costumes of the\r\nchiefs who came to meet them as envoys or join them as allies; and\r\namong the splendid gems which adorned their persons they recognized\r\nemeralds and turquoises of such rare perfection and beauty that their\r\ncupidity was excited to the highest degree. During the after years of\r\nconquest and occupation the avaricious spoilers sought in vain for\r\nthe parent ledge where these precious stones were found. Recent times\r\nhave, however, revealed the home of the Mexican turquoise, which has\r\nproved to be in the northern part of Mexico, as the Totonacs informed\r\nthe inquiring Spaniards. The first of these mines, which is of great\r\nantiquity, is situated in the Cerrillos Mountains, eighteen miles\r\nfrom Santa Fé. The deposit occurs in soft trachyte, and an immense\r\ncavity of several hundred feet in extent has been excavated by the\r\nIndians while searching for this gem in past times. Probably some\r\nof the fine turquoises worn by the Aztec nobles at the time of the\r\nSpanish Conquest came from this mine. Another mine is located in the\r\nSierra Blanca Mountains in New Mexico, but the Navajos will not allow\r\nstrangers to visit it. Stones of transcendent beauty have been taken\r\nfrom it, and handed down in the tribe from generation to generation as\r\nheirlooms. Nothing tempts the cupidity of the Indians to dispose of\r\nthese gems, and gratitude alone causes them to part with any of these\r\ntreasures, which, like the mountaineers of Thibet, they regard with\r\nmystical reverence. The Navajos wear them as ear-drops, by boring them\r\nand attaching them to the ear by means of a deer sinew. Lesser stones\r\nare pierced, then strung on sinews, and worn as necklaces. Even the\r\nnobler Ute Indians, when stripping the ornaments of turquoise from the\r\nears of the conquered Navajos, value them as sacred treasures, and\r\nrefuse to part with them even for gold or silver.\r\n\r\nAll the Spanish accounts of the invasion of Mexico agree in the\r\ngreat abundance of emeralds, both in the adornment of the chiefs and\r\nnobles and also in the decoration of the gods, the thrones, and the\r\nparaphernalia. The Mexican historian Ixtlilxochitl says the throne of\r\ngold in the palace of Tezcuco was inlaid with turquoises and other\r\nprecious stones; that a human skull in front of it was crowned with an\r\nimmense emerald of a pyramidal form.\r\n\r\nThe great standard of the republic of Tlascala was richly ornamented\r\nwith emeralds and silver-work. The fantastic helmets of the chiefs\r\nglittered with gold and precious stones, and their plumes were set\r\nwith emeralds. The mantle of Montezuma was held together by a clasp of\r\nthe green chalchivitl (jade), and the same precious gem, with emeralds\r\nof uncommon size, ornamented other parts of his dress.\r\n\r\nThe Mexicans carved the obdurate jade and emerald with wonderful skill,\r\nusing, like the Peruvians, nothing but silicious powder and copper\r\ninstruments alloyed with tin. They also worked with exquisite taste\r\nin gold and silver, and they represented Nature so faithfully and so\r\nbeautifully that the great naturalist Hernandez took many of these\r\nobjects thus portrayed for his models when describing the natural\r\nhistory of the country.\r\n\r\nWhen Cortez returned home he displayed five emeralds of extraordinary\r\nsize and beauty, and presented them to his bride, the niece of the\r\nDuke de Bejar. On his famous expedition along the Pacific coast and up\r\nthe Gulf of California he was reduced to such want as to be obliged to\r\npawn these jewels for a time. One of them was as precious as Shylock’s\r\nturquoise, and Gomara states that some Genoese merchants who examined\r\nit in Seville offered forty thousand golden ducats for it. One of the\r\nemeralds was in the form of a rose; the second in that of a horn; the\r\nthird like a fish with eyes of gold; the fourth was like a little bell,\r\nwith a fine pearl for a tongue, and it bore on its rim the following\r\ninscription in Spanish: “Blessed is he who created thee!” The fifth,\r\nwhich was the most valuable of all, was in the form of a small cup\r\nwith a foot of gold, and with four little chains of the same metal\r\nattached to a large pearl as a button: the edge of the cup was of\r\ngold, on which was engraved in Latin words, “Inter natos mulierum non\r\nsurrexit major.” These splendid gems are now buried deep in the sand\r\non the coast of Barbary, where they were lost in 1529, when Cortez was\r\nshipwrecked with the Admiral of Castile whilst on their way to assist\r\nCharles V. at the siege of Algiers.\r\n\r\nMariana, in his history of Spain, declares that Cortez had, besides\r\nthe five great historical emeralds, also two emerald vases which were\r\nvalued at 300,000 ducats. Whether these remarkable treasures were\r\nswallowed up by the sea with the other five when the conqueror of\r\nMexico was shipwrecked, history does not relate.\r\n\r\nAmong the presents sent to Charles V. of Spain by the first Spanish\r\ncommissioners, Puerto Carreso and Montijo, in 1519, and also by\r\nMontezuma through his governor Teuthlili, were the following articles,\r\naccording to the description given by Peter Martyr, the learned\r\nItalian, who enjoyed the friendship of Columbus and the confidence of\r\nthe Spanish Court. The Chronicles of Gomara also contain the same list:\r\na gold necklace composed of seven pieces with 183 small emeralds set\r\nin it, and 232 gems similar to small rubies, from which hung 27 little\r\nbells of gold and several fine pearls; another necklace composed of\r\nfour pieces of gold with 102 red gems like small rubies, 172 emeralds,\r\nand 10 fine pearls, with 26 little bells of gold attached.\r\n\r\nThe historians, Gomara and Martyr, mention among the prizes which fell\r\ninto the hands of Cortez, an immense emerald of a pyramidal form,\r\nwhose base was as large as the palm of the hand; and which may have\r\nbeen the identical stone which crowned the skull which stood before\r\nthe throne in the palace of Tezcuco. At all events, an emerald of this\r\ndescription Cortez sent as a present to the Emperor of Spain, together\r\nwith his letters of explanation, after the fall of the city of Mexico.\r\nThe letters and the various presents were intrusted to the care of\r\ntwo of his confidential officers, Quinones and Avila. Arriving at the\r\nAzores, Quinones lost his life in a brawl, and jeopardized the mission;\r\nbut Avila escaped and put to sea, to be captured shortly after by a\r\nFrench privateer; and the rich spoils of the Aztecs were presented to\r\nthe King of France, instead of the Emperor of Spain. Francis I. gazed\r\nwith delight upon the splendors of the gem, and with a feeling of envy\r\nexclaimed that he “would like to see the clause in Adam’s testament,\r\nwhich entitled his brothers of Castile and Portugal to divide the New\r\nWorld between them.” What has become of this historic stone?\r\n\r\nThe quantity of emeralds obtained by the Spaniards in their pillage of\r\nMexico was large; but it was trifling when compared with that collected\r\nby Pizarro and his remorseless followers in the sack of Peru. Many\r\nlarge and magnificent stones were then obtained by the Spaniards; but\r\nthe transcendent gem of all, called by the Peruvians the Great Mother,\r\nand nearly as large as an ostrich egg, was concealed by the natives,\r\nand all the efforts of Pizarro and his successors to discover it proved\r\nunavailing.\r\n\r\nPrevious to the plunder of America by Cortez and his followers,\r\nemeralds were not numerous in Europe; but early in the sixteenth\r\ncentury they began to appear in Spain, and were soon afterwards\r\ndistributed among the powerful and wealthy throughout Europe. England\r\nseems to have had at one time a large share of them, and perhaps many\r\nof them were taken by her freebooters from the richly laden Spanish\r\ngalleons. In the days of Queen Elizabeth emeralds were exhibited in\r\nprofusion, if we can give credence to the chronicles and inventories of\r\nthat period.\r\n\r\nThe parure of emeralds which the Queen of Navarre bequeathed in 1572,\r\nto her daughter Catherine, must have been of wonderful beauty and\r\nperfection.\r\n\r\nWhat is the stone lately given to Mustapha, the ex-premier of Tunis,\r\nby the Bey, and described as the famous emerald once belonging to the\r\nSpanish Crown? Was it one recovered from the shipwreck of Cortez, or\r\nwas it one of those given away by the Spanish rulers in the early days\r\nof the conquest of Peru, when they imagined the emerald mines were as\r\nbroad and exhaustless as the silver beds of Potosi?\r\n\r\nThe finest emerald in Europe is said to belong to the Emperor of\r\nRussia. It weighs but thirty karats; but it is of the most perfect\r\ntransparency, and of the most beautiful color. There are many other\r\nfine emeralds among the imperial jewels of the Czar, some of which\r\nare of great size and rare beauty. The ancient crown of Vladimir\r\nglitters with four great stones of unusual brilliancy. The grand state\r\nsceptre is surmounted by another emerald of great size. The sceptre\r\nof Poland, which is now treasured in the Kremlin, has a long green\r\nstone, fractured in the middle. It is not described, and may be one of\r\nthe Siberian tourmalines, some of which closely approach the emerald\r\nin hue. The imperial orb of Russia, which is said to be of Byzantine\r\nworkmanship of the tenth century, has fifty emeralds. This fact alone\r\nwould seem to prove that emeralds were known in Europe or Asia Minor\r\nlong before the discovery of America; but, on the other hand, the\r\nancient crown which was taken when Kazan was subjugated in 1553,\r\nis destitute of emeralds. And hence we are inclined to believe the\r\nimperial orb to be of modern workmanship, especially as some of the\r\nancient state chairs do not exhibit emeralds among their decoration of\r\ngems and precious stones.\r\n\r\nThe immense uncut Peruvian emerald, given by Rudolph II. to the Elector\r\nof Saxony, is still preserved in the Green Vaults at Dresden.\r\n\r\nQueen Elizabeth of England sent to Henry IV., the champion of the\r\nReformed faith, a beautiful emerald, which she herself had worn. She\r\ngave it as a token of esteem, and reminded the gay monarch that the gem\r\npossessed the virtue of not breaking so long as faith remains entire\r\nand firm.\r\n\r\nIt has been stated that the Emperor Charlemagne regarded the gift\r\nfrom the Empress Irene as the dearest of all his talismans. This\r\ntreasure consisted of a piece of the true cross, enclosed in a large\r\nemerald, which was attached to a strong chain of golden links. When\r\nhis sepulchre was rifled of the treasures deposited with the deceased\r\nmonarch, this relic was removed with the rest of the jewels; and\r\nin 1811 was presented to Napoleon by the Burghers of the city of\r\nAix-la-Chapelle. Bonaparte one day playfully threw it over the neck\r\nof Queen Hortense, declaring that he had worn it on his breast in the\r\nbloody battles of Austerlitz and Wagram, as Charlemagne had worn it on\r\nthe field of battle in the Middle Ages. Hortense wore it until the day\r\nof her death.\r\n\r\nThe emeralds of the French Crown at the time the famous inventory was\r\ntaken in 1781, do not appear to have been of very great purity. Several\r\nof them exhibited fine color, but had many faults. Five of the best\r\nwere valued at that time at fifty thousand francs, or ten thousand\r\ndollars, each.\r\n\r\nIn the famous Hungarian crown, the large sapphire is surrounded with\r\nfour green stones of oblong form, whose species are unknown. It is\r\nalso a mystery how they came there, as they are not mentioned in the\r\ninventory made of the jewel when Queen Elizabeth of Hungary pledged it\r\nto the Emperor Frederick IV.\r\n\r\nThe Sultan of Turkey is known to possess some exquisite emeralds; and\r\nRambusson, a French writer on gems, declares that they are the finest\r\nin the world. One of them is said to weigh one hundred and twenty-five\r\nounces, and is probably another lump of antique glass. Another of three\r\nhundred karats weight, and of less doubtful character, is a gem of\r\ngreat purity and perfection of color. It adorns the handle of a poniard.\r\n\r\nIn the museum at Florence there is a small vase carved in emerald, and\r\nalso another ornament of similar form, fashioned from a fine beryl.\r\nThe mineralogical collection at Munich boasts of some immense emeralds\r\nwhich are supposed to have been obtained from Spain, and part of\r\nher Peruvian booty. There are also some splendid specimens of uncut\r\nemeralds in the cabinet of minerals at Vienna. The Saxon and the Papal\r\ncrowns contain very beautiful emeralds.\r\n\r\nProbably the most beautiful specimen of the natural emerald in the\r\nworld is that presented to the renowned shrine of Loretto in Italy, by\r\nDon Pierre Daragon, when Spanish ambassador at Rome. He was formerly\r\nviceroy in Peru and obtained the treasure at that time. The specimen\r\nis a mass of white limestone, crowned with great crystals of emeralds\r\nmore than an inch in diameter and of exquisite color and lustre.\r\n\r\nThe name of Emerald Isle is generally supposed to have been derived\r\nfrom the ever green appearance of its shores but an antiquary asserts\r\nthat it arose from the ring which was set with “Optimo Smaragdo,” and\r\nwhich Pope Adrian sent to King Henry II. as the instrument of his\r\ninvestiture with the dominion of Ireland.\r\n\r\nThere is a very fine and large crystal of emerald in the museum at\r\nLeiden, but its history is unknown.\r\n\r\nDhuleep Singh of India possesses a flattened crystal of three inches in\r\nlength by two in width, and half an inch in depth, which is regarded as\r\nof great value in India. It is said to be of very fine color and with\r\nbut few imperfections.\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Devonshire’s crystal in its natural state is reckoned as\r\none of the finest, if not the finest single specimen in the world. It\r\nis from Muzo in New Granada, and more than two inches in length. Its\r\nform is that of a hexagonal crystal, and its weight is 8 oz. 18 dwts.\r\nThe color of the stone is beautiful, but several flaws impair the value\r\nas a gem.\r\n\r\nDuring the visit of the Prince of Wales to India, many fine emeralds\r\nwere exhibited to the royal party by the Hindoo nobility. At the\r\ngrand reception given them at Madras, the Prince of Virianagram wore\r\na bracelet composed of three splendid emeralds of very great size.\r\nAt Kandy, in Ceylon, the Buddhist priests brought forth from their\r\nsanctuary for the inspection of the Prince, an immense emerald four\r\ninches long by two inches in depth.\r\n\r\nA ring cut out of a single emerald, 1¹⁄₄ inches in diameter, with the\r\nname of the Emperor Jehangir engraved upon it, was presented to the\r\nEast India Company.\r\n\r\nOne of the most costly and difficult works in engraving upon the\r\nemerald in modern times, was that executed by Carlo Costanzi during the\r\nlast century. Upon a table of emerald two inches in diameter, the head\r\nof Pope Benedict and those of St. Peter and St. Paul were engraved. Two\r\nyears and a half were required by the lapidary for the execution of his\r\ntask. The engraved gem may now be seen in the treasury of St. Petronio\r\nat Bologna.\r\n\r\nSome very fine emeralds are said to be preserved in the royal\r\ncollection at Madrid, one quite as large as the Devonshire emerald and\r\nwithout many flaws.\r\n\r\nThe Spanish freebooters, returning home from their American fights\r\nladen with gems, did not forget the shrines of Spain in their peace\r\nofferings. Marshal Lannes, in sacking the church of our Lady of the\r\nPillar, which was one of the richest in Spain, obtained an immense\r\nbooty. Madame Junot declares in her memoirs that it was not far below\r\nfive millions of francs in value.\r\n\r\nHarsh stories are also told of the acts of vandalism of Marshal Junot\r\nwhile he was military governor of Spain. It is related that when\r\nhe visited the Cathedral of Toledo, the church dignitaries freely\r\nexhibited to him the magnificent jewels and treasures which belonged\r\nto the church and had been accumulating for many ages. The crown of\r\nthe Virgin, which was beautifully constructed of gold and adorned with\r\nexquisite gems, was placed in his hands for close examination. The\r\nsummit of this admirable and holy piece of human art was surmounted by\r\na large emerald of almost transcendent beauty. The French freebooter\r\nexamined the beautiful jewel for a few moments, and then coolly\r\ntwisted off the emerald from its setting and placed it in his pocket,\r\nexclaiming, with a Parisian grimace, “Ceci doit être à moi.”\r\n\r\nFinely formed crystals of emerald, when not too large, were in early\r\ntimes mounted in gold and in jewelry without receiving any artificial\r\npolish from the lapidary. Examples are often found in the tombs of\r\nantiquity. The Princess Bariatinsky has a valuable necklace of ancient\r\nemeralds fashioned in this manner.\r\n\r\nThe Orientals, taking advantage of the facility with which the prisms\r\nare broken at right angles to the axis, frequently used slices of the\r\ncrystals, sometimes artificially polished, but often with the natural\r\nplanes of cleavage preserved. This practice was quite common prior to\r\nthe fifteenth century. They also adopted the unfortunate custom of\r\nengraving them with condensed quotations from the Koran, and often\r\ndrilled holes through the centre of the stones so as to string them as\r\nnecklaces or as ear ornaments.\r\n\r\nOne of the finest gems that adorned the gorgeous harness of Runjeet\r\nSingh was a beautiful emerald maltreated in this manner. Major Pearse\r\nfound in a Punjaub tope a reliquary formed from an emerald three inches\r\nlong and two inches thick, with the ends rounded off. It was originally\r\na gem of fine color, but had been bored half through its axis to\r\ncontain two finger joints of some revered Buddhist saint or petted\r\nmonkey.\r\n\r\nThe emerald has been a subject of controversy among the chemists and\r\nmineralogists, and its character, especially the cause of its beautiful\r\ncolor, is not clearly defined even at the present day. But that\r\ndistinguished chemist, Professor Lewy of Paris, seems to offer, thus\r\nfar, the most correct and plausible theory. More than ten years ago\r\nhe boldly asserted that the hue is not due to the oxide of chromium,\r\nand with this opinion he confronted such eminent men as Vauquelin,\r\nKlaproth, and others of high rank in the scientific world. Not\r\ncontent with his researches in his laboratory in Paris, he resolutely\r\ncrossed the ocean and sought the emerald in its parent ledges in the\r\nlofty table-lands of New Granada. Here he obtained new information\r\nof a geological character which goes far to strengthen his position.\r\nThe experiments of M. Lewy indicate, if they do not prove, that the\r\ncoloring matter of the emerald is organic, and readily destroyed\r\nby heat, which would not be the case if it was due to the oxide of\r\nchromium. All my own fire-tests with the Granada emerald corroborate\r\nthe views of M. Lewy, for in every instance the gem lost its hue when\r\nsubmitted to a red heat.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, the recent researches of Wöhler and Rose give negative\r\nresults. These experienced chemists kept an emerald at the temperature\r\nof melted copper for an hour, and found that, although the stone had\r\nbecome opaque, the color was not affected. They therefore considered\r\nthe oxide of chromium to be the coloring agent, without, however,\r\ndenying the presence of organic matter. The amount of the oxide of\r\nchromium found by many chemists varies from one to two per cent, while\r\nLewy and others found it in a quantity so small as to be inappreciable,\r\nand too minute to be weighed.\r\n\r\nBefore the ordinary blowpipe the emerald passes rapidly into a whitish\r\nvesicular glass, and with borax it forms a fine green glass, while its\r\nsub-species, the beryl, changes into a colorless bead; with salt of\r\nphosphorus it slowly dissolves, leaving a silicious skeleton.\r\n\r\nM. Lewy visited the mines at Muzo in Granada, and from the results of\r\nhis analyses, together with the fact of finding emeralds in conjunction\r\nwith the presence of fossil shells in the limestone in which they\r\noccur, he arrived at the conclusion that they have been formed in the\r\nwet way,--deposited from a chemical solution. He also found that when\r\nextracted they are so soft and fragile that the largest and finest\r\nfragments can be reduced to powder by merely rubbing them between the\r\nfingers, and the crystals often crack and fall to pieces after being\r\nremoved from the mine, apparently from loss of water. Consequently,\r\nwhen the emeralds are first extracted they are laid aside carefully for\r\na few days until the water is evaporated.\r\n\r\nThis statement relative to the softness of the gem and its subsequent\r\nhardening has been met with a shout of derision from some of the\r\ngem-seekers,--none louder than that of Barbot, the retired jeweller.\r\nBarbot seems to forget that the rock of which his own house in Paris is\r\nconstructed undergoes the same change after being removed from the deep\r\nquarries in the catacombs under the city.\r\n\r\nThis phenomenon is observed with many rocks. Flints acquire additional\r\ntoughness by the evaporation of water contained in them. The yellow\r\ngneiss of Ceylon is soft when quarried, but hardens on exposure to the\r\natmosphere. The Egyptian verde antique marble, which was named after\r\nAugustus and Tiberias, was easily quarried with steel implements, but\r\nquickly hardened on exposure to the external air. The mosaic plates\r\nof this mineral which are inlaid in the decorative work of the Tuscan\r\nGothic buildings are yet quite hard. The steatite of Saint Anthony’s\r\nFalls grows harder on exposure, and other minerals, when quarried\r\nfrom considerable depths, become firmer on exposure to the action of\r\nthe air. Observations of this kind led Kuhlman to investigate the\r\ncause; and he believes that the hardening of rocks is not owing\r\nsolely to the evaporation of quarry-water, but that it depends upon\r\nthe tendency which all earthy matters possess to undergo a spontaneous\r\ncrystallization by slow desiccation, which commences the moment the\r\nrock is exposed to the air.\r\n\r\nThe coloring matter of the emerald seems to be derived from the\r\ndecomposition of the remains of animals who have lived in a bygone age,\r\nand whose remains are now found fossilized in the rock which forms the\r\nmatrix of the gem. This rock in Granada is a black limestone, with\r\nwhite veins containing ammonites. Specimens of these rocks, exhibiting\r\nfragments of emeralds _in situ_ and also ammonites, are to be seen in\r\nthe mineralogical gallery of the Jardin des Plantes in Paris. Lewy\r\nbelieves that the beautiful tint of these gems is produced by an\r\norganic substance, which he considers to be a carburet of hydrogen,\r\nsimilar to that called chlorophyll, which constitutes the coloring\r\nmatter of the leaves of plants; and he has shown that the emeralds of\r\nthe darkest hue, which contain the greatest amount of organic matter,\r\nlose their color completely at a low red heat, and become opaque and\r\nwhite; while minerals and pastes which are well known to be colored by\r\nchromium, like the green garnets (the lime-chrome garnets) of Siberia,\r\nare unchanged in hue by the action of heat.\r\n\r\nAt the present time the composition of the emerald is supposed to be\r\na silicate of alumina and glucina, with traces of organic matter and\r\nalso other earths and oxides; but silica, alumina, and glucina are the\r\nprincipal component parts. It resembles quartz in some of its physical\r\nproperties, having a specific gravity of 2.6 to 2.7, and a refractive\r\nenergy of 1.58, but its degree of hardness is slightly greater, ranging\r\nfrom 7.5 to 8.0, while that of quartz is but 7.0.\r\n\r\nThe Peruvians maintain that the emerald ripens and deepens in color\r\nafter having been mined and exposed to the air and light. Whether\r\nthis assertion has been corroborated or not we cannot yet say; but it\r\nis a well-substantiated fact that some minerals do gain in color and\r\nhardness on exposure, and equally well proved that many others lose\r\ntheir tints very perceptibly. Strange to say, the cystine calculi\r\nundergo a similar change of color, and assume a fine greenish-blue tint\r\nwhen exposed to the light, changing from a fawn color. The specimens\r\nin Guy’s Museum described by Dr. Marcet in 1817 were of a pale\r\nbrown, but according to the report of Golding Bird they now resemble\r\nthe green sulphate of iron. Dr. Peter observed the same mysterious\r\nchange of color in the two cystine calculi preserved in the museum of\r\nTransylvania University, and noted the fact that the change takes place\r\non the side exposed to the light.\r\n\r\nBut one locality thus far has been discovered in the United States or\r\neven in North America, and this occurs in North Carolina. For several\r\nyears previous to the year 1880, Mr. J. A. Stephenson, a collector of\r\nminerals, had obtained in Alexander County a number of beryls and\r\ncrystals of transparent minerals which had the shape of beryl with a\r\ntint of the emerald hue, also other crystals of acicular form which\r\nexhibited the true color of the finest Granada specimens of emeralds.\r\n\r\nSome of these minerals were shown in 1880 to William E. Hidden, a\r\nyoung naturalist then engaged in searching the mineral belts of North\r\nand South Carolina and Georgia for rare minerals. The beauty of these\r\nspecimens led the young enthusiast to make a thorough search for the\r\nparent ledge; and, after a few weeks of earnest labor in cutting deep\r\nditches in the soil near the spot where a number of crystals had been\r\nfound, he was rewarded with the discovery of the original deposit in\r\na rock of gneiss. In this rock, in which felspar preponderates, he\r\nfound implanted in open pockets and lenticular fissures crystals of\r\nemeralds, quartz, rutile, monazite, beryl, and also many crystals\r\nof long and slender shapes which appeared to be diopside, but which\r\nexhibited colors of white, yellow, and green of the most beautiful\r\nemerald hues. The mineral which appeared to be diopside was submitted\r\nto the examination of the distinguished chemist, J. Lawrence Smith,\r\nwho soon pronounced it to be a new form of spodumene, and named it\r\nHiddenite after the young explorer. Since then the explorations have\r\nbeen continued, and have yielded many very beautiful specimens of\r\nboth the emerald and the hiddenite. At the depth of thirty-three feet\r\nbelow the surface of the rock several pockets were discovered which\r\nyielded some beautiful emeralds and hiddenites. They occurred at the\r\nbottom of the pockets, just as the finest crystals of tourmaline are\r\nfound in the cavities of the granite ledges at Mount Mica in Maine.\r\nTwelve of these pockets were found within an area of forty feet square,\r\nextending to thirty feet in depth. The largest crystal of emerald found\r\nwas more than three inches in length and three quarters of an inch in\r\nbreadth, but its color, although of the true emerald hue, is, however,\r\nrather faint. Some of the smaller crystals are of much deeper tint,\r\nand resemble the pure specimens from Granada. But the most interesting\r\ntreasures of the mineral kingdom revealed by this exploration were\r\nthe crystals which analysis proved to be composed of a silicate of\r\nalumina and lithia, otherwise known as spodumene. Some of these\r\ncrystals were white or light yellow, others were of a rich yellow hue\r\nshading into brown, while others exhibited the purest prismatic green\r\nof various depths of hue. In some of the green crystals the color has\r\nbeen uniform, while in others it is more intense at one end of their\r\nextremities.\r\n\r\nQuite a number of the crystals and their fragments have been cut and\r\npolished into gems which rival, by their lustre and beauty of color,\r\nthe best of the South American emeralds. On account of their extreme\r\nrarity, as well as their beauty, they have been sought for by amateurs,\r\nand have commanded high prices. As the field of deposit thus far known\r\nis quite limited, we fear that the yield of this charming mineral will\r\nnot meet even the demands of science.\r\n\r\nProfessor Cleaveland, who was one of the best authorities of his day,\r\nmaintained more than half a century ago that emeralds which exhibited a\r\nlively and beautiful green hue were found in blasting a canal through\r\na ledge of graphic granite in the town of Topsham in Maine. Several\r\nof the crystals presented so pure, uniform, and rich a green, that he\r\nventured to pronounce them precious emeralds. But to-day we are unable\r\nto verify the assertion, or point to a single specimen similar in hue\r\nto the emerald from the above-mentioned locality.\r\n\r\nThe nearest approach to the emerald in color, with the exception\r\nof the incomparable green tourmalines from Maine, and the emeralds\r\nand hiddenites of North Carolina, are the beryls of North and South\r\nRoyalston, in the State of Massachusetts. These beautiful stones\r\nexhibit the physical characteristics of emeralds, with the exception\r\nof the color, in which they differ very perceptibly. But to appreciate\r\nfully the difference in hue we must compare the two gems. Then the\r\nlively green of the beryl fades away before the overpowering hue of the\r\nemerald, whose rich prismatic green may be taken as the purest type of\r\nthat color known to the chemist or the painter.\r\n\r\nSeveral years ago we visited the localities in Massachusetts which were\r\nfamous in the days of Hitchcock and Webster. We found that the beryls\r\noccurred in a very coarse granite, where the quartz appeared in masses\r\nand the felspar in huge crystals. These also occur in finer granite,\r\nand exhibit no indications of veins or connection with each other.\r\nThey are few in number, and are soon exhausted by blasting, being\r\ngenerally very superficial. After removing several tons of the rock at\r\nthe locality at North Royalston, where the beryls appear on the summit\r\nof the loftiest hill, our labors were at length rewarded with two\r\nbeautiful crystals. One of them was a fine prism an inch in diameter,\r\nof perfect transparency and of a deep sea-green color, which, however,\r\nis far from being similar to the transcendent hue of the Granada\r\nemeralds, which exhibit an excess of neither blue nor yellow. The other\r\nwas yellowish-green, resembling the chrysoberyls of Brazil.\r\n\r\nOther but imperfect crystals were brought to light, some fragments\r\nof which exhibited the deepest golden tints of the topaz, and others\r\nthe tints of the sherry-wine colored topazes of Siberia. Magnificent\r\ncrystals have been found in these localities in times long past, and\r\nfrom the fragments and sections of crystals found in the _débris_ of\r\nearly explorations, we observed the wide range of color, and the deep\r\nlongitudinal striæ which characterize the renowned beryls from the\r\nAltai Mountains, in Siberia. Lively sea and grass green, light and deep\r\nyellow, also blue crystals of various shades, have been found here.\r\n\r\nAt the quarries on Rollestone Mountain in Fitchburg, beryls of a\r\nrich golden color have been blasted out. Some of these approach the\r\nchrysoberyl and topaz in hardness and hue. Others so closely resemble\r\nthe yellow diamond that they may readily be taken for that superior\r\ngem. The refractive power of these yellow stones is remarkable; and the\r\ngoniometer will probably reveal a higher index than is accorded to all\r\nthe varieties of beryl by the learned Abbé Haüy.\r\n\r\nBeautiful transparent beryls have been found among the granite hills of\r\nOxford County in Maine; and the late Governor Lincoln, nearly half a\r\ncentury ago, possessed a splendid crystal, quite three inches in length\r\nand of great purity and brilliancy. Some very beautiful transparent\r\nblue crystals of beryl have recently been found in the western part of\r\nOxford County, Maine, which have yielded gems of considerable value.\r\nProbably active search for this mineral in this region will bring to\r\nlight some charming specimens.\r\n\r\nNew Hampshire is famous for its gigantic beryls; and the localities\r\nof Acworth and Grafton have yielded some enormous crystals. One was\r\nremoved by Mr. Alger, of more than a ton in weight; and a still larger\r\none was observed by Mr. Hubbard, who estimated its weight at two\r\nand one half tons. These gross specimens are generally opaque, with\r\npatches of translucent or even transparent mineral on their sides.\r\nThe regularity of their crystalline forms is also much impaired or\r\ndistorted.\r\n\r\nAt Haddam, in Connecticut, beautiful crystals of beryl have been\r\ndiscovered; and one of these of fine green color, an inch in diameter\r\nand several inches in length, was preserved in the cabinet of Colonel\r\nGibbs. Professor Silliman possessed another fine one, seven inches in\r\nlength.\r\n\r\nThe mountains in Colorado have yielded some fine specimens. But the\r\nfinest of the beryl species come from Russia. In the Ural Mountains\r\nthe crystals are small, but of fine color; in the Altai Mountains they\r\nare very large and of a greenish-blue; but in the granitic ledges of\r\nOdon Tchelon in Daouria, on the frontier of China, they are found in\r\nthe greatest perfection. They occur on the summit of the mountain\r\nin irregular veins of micaceous and white indurated clay, and are\r\ngreenish-yellow, pure pale-green, greenish-blue, and sky-blue. The\r\nchief matrix of the beryl all over the world is graphic granite, but it\r\nmay occur in other rocks. The light green stones of Limoges, in France,\r\nappear in a vein of quartz traversing granite. At Royalston we observed\r\nthem to spring seemingly from the felspar and project into smoky\r\nquartz, becoming more transparent as they advanced into the harder\r\nstone.\r\n\r\nThe beryl possesses the same crystalline form and specific gravity\r\nas the emerald, but its hardness, especially in the blue and white\r\nvarieties, is sometimes greater. They are both silicates of alumina,\r\nand the only perceptible difference in the two stones is in the\r\ncolor. Cleaveland thought that as the emerald and beryl had the same\r\nessential characters, they might gradually pass into each other; and\r\nKlaproth, finding the oxides of both chrome and iron in one specimen,\r\nwas led to take the same view. The crystals of true emerald are almost\r\nalways small, with the exception of those found in the Wald district\r\nin Siberia, whilst those of the beryl vary from a few grains to more\r\nthan a ton in weight. The crystals of both are almost invariably\r\nregular hexahedral prisms, sometimes slightly modified. Those of the\r\nberyl we sometimes find quite flat, as though they had been compressed\r\nby force; then again they are acicular and of extraordinary length,\r\nconsidering their slender diameter. Sometimes their lateral faces are\r\nlongitudinally striated, and as deeply as the tourmaline, so that the\r\nedges of the prism are rendered indistinct. Other crystals are curved,\r\nand some perforated in the axis like the tourmaline, so as to contain\r\nother minerals. Sometimes they are articulated like the pillars of\r\nbasalt, and separated at some distance by the intervening quartz. These\r\nmodified forms give rise to curious speculations as to their formation\r\nand origin. If we admit the action of fire (which is improbable), then\r\nthe separation may be easily explained; but if we insist that they were\r\ndeposited in the wet way and by slow process, how can we account for\r\nthe dislocation? “By electricity,” whispers a friend,--“by telluric\r\nmagnetism, that wonderful unexplained and mysterious force which has\r\ncaused the grand geological changes of the globe, and is still at work.”\r\n\r\nSometimes the crystals of beryl are of two distinct colors, but\r\ngenerally they are of one color, often shading into white at either\r\nextremity. They may exhibit the richest golden-yellow, or a light\r\ncerulean blue, or a clear sea-green like those described by Pliny, now\r\ncalled aqua-marines. “Qui viridatem puri maris imitantur.”\r\n\r\nOne distinction between beryl and quartz is afforded by the appearance\r\nof its fracture. A crystal of beryl breaks into smooth planes, the\r\nfaces of which are at right angles to the axis of the prism; while the\r\nfracture of the surface of broken quartz is invariably conchoidal.\r\n\r\nBlue beryls were highly prized by the ancients. Beautiful specimens\r\nare found in the glens of the Mourne Mountains in Ireland. But finer\r\ngems are brought from the granite district of Nertschinsk, in Siberia,\r\nand also from various localities in the Uralian and Altaian Mountains,\r\nwhere the Romans were supposed to have obtained them in early times.\r\n\r\nIts name is derived from the Persian “belur,” which the Romans changed\r\ninto “beryllus.” Sometimes it occurs of a rose color. A few have\r\nbeen found at Elba and one at Haddam by Colonel Gibbs. One of the\r\nmost beautiful specimens of beryl known was discovered in Siberia.\r\nIt consisted of a magnificent crystal of smoky quartz, in the base\r\nof which appeared several fine crystals of beryl, of an exquisite\r\nyellowish-green and greenish-blue.\r\n\r\nIn the princely collection of Mr. Vaux, of Philadelphia, may be seen a\r\ncrystal of beryl from the Mourne Mountains of Ireland, two inches in\r\nlength by five eighths of an inch in diameter. It is of a celestial\r\nblue color, much deeper in hue at one extremity than at the other. But\r\nthe gem of this collection among the beryls is a specimen purchased\r\nin Russia, in 1875. It is a six-sided prism nine inches in length and\r\nsix inches in circumference. The color is of a rich oily green, and\r\nseveral inches of its upper extremity is transparent, while the rest\r\nis translucent. It rests upon a mass of granite, and is a specimen of\r\nextraordinary size and beauty.\r\n\r\nMr. Clay of the same city has a remarkable prism of Siberian beryl two\r\ninches in diameter, which exhibits a tint of celestial blue externally\r\nbut which appears of a decided green hue in its interior.\r\n\r\nAt the Centennial Exhibition Brazil exhibited a fine crystal of a warm\r\nceladine green color. Russia displayed some very beautiful specimens of\r\nthe yellow, green, and blue beryls from Siberia. Some very beautiful\r\ncrystals of emerald, both solitary and fixed in the matrix, were also\r\nexhibited from the same country.\r\n\r\nSeveral of the mineralogical cabinets of Europe possess fine suites\r\nof the emerald and beryl in a great variety of forms and degrees of\r\nperfection. Those of the École des Mines at St. Petersburg, the Jardin\r\ndes Plantes at Paris, and the British Museum, are of very great\r\ncommercial value and mineralogical interest.\r\n\r\nAt the French Exposition in 1867, the celebrated jeweller, Froment\r\nMeurice, exhibited a beautiful specimen of modern glyptic art cut in\r\nberyl. It comprised the bust of the Emperor Napoleon III. carved in\r\npure aqua-marine. The image was placed upon a miniature pedestal of\r\nblood-red jasper, before which the imperial eagle spread his wings and\r\nperched upon a base of red jasper, which was studded with stars of\r\ntopazes, bosses of pearls, and bordered with roses formed of minute\r\namethysts.\r\n\r\nA beautiful blue stone adorns the summit of the crown of England, and\r\nhas been described as a sapphire of unusual purity. But mineralogists\r\naffirm, that the gem is a blue beryl, and it is surmised by others that\r\nit is the identical and famous stone which Edward the Confessor wore\r\nin a ring. It is of a lovely color, oval in form, and measures 2¹⁄₁₀\r\ninches in length by 1¹⁄₂ in width, and 1¹⁄₅ in depth.\r\n\r\nA superb aqua-marine formerly adorned the tiara of Pope Julius II.\r\nand was considered as one of the most celebrated in the world,\r\nnotwithstanding it exhibited a slight flaw. This gem, which was of\r\nan exquisite sea-green color, was 2¹⁄₁₀ inches in length and 2²⁄₅ in\r\ndepth. After having been kept in the Museum of Natural History in Paris\r\nfor more than three hundred years, Napoleon presented it to Pope Pius\r\nVII.\r\n\r\nThe Asiatics, and especially the Turkish officers, prize the prisms of\r\nberyl as handles to their scimetars and daggers. This fondness for\r\ndecoration of sword-blades and arms is by no means confined to the\r\nsoldiers of the East. The officers of Napoleon’s armies exhibited the\r\nsame taste. Murat adorned the hilt of his sword with one of the finest\r\nberyls ever seen in Europe. Another famous aqua-marine formed the\r\nhandle of the sword of the poet Moncrif, who, like another celebrated\r\nswordsman, the painter Caravaggio, compelled admiration of his works at\r\nthe point of his sword. This blood-stained gem bore as inscription the\r\nepitomized history of the author, a quotation from the poet Theophile,\r\n“Tous mes jours sont des Mardis-gras.”\r\n\r\nOne of the most beautiful beryls known is that purchased by the English\r\nbanker, Mr. Hope, and placed in his collection of gems. It weighs six\r\nand one half ounces, and cost its princely owner nearly twenty-five\r\nhundred dollars. It is reported to have come from the mine of Cangazum,\r\nin the district of Coimbatoor in India, a locality which has been long\r\nfamous for its fine beryls.\r\n\r\nThe most magnificent aqua-marine described in history is that belonging\r\nto Dom Pedro. It was found in the diamond districts of Minas Geraes,\r\nin Brazil. In form and size it resembles the head of a calf. Only on\r\none side does it preserve any trace of a crystalline form; the rest\r\nis water-worn. It is said to be of a fine color, without a flaw, and\r\nperfectly transparent.\r\n\r\nFor many ages the shrine of the Abbey of St. Denys, at Paris, received\r\nrare and valuable gems as offerings; and at the time of the French\r\nRevolution the collection had become very valuable. The iconoclasts\r\nordered it to be separated and sold. It brought 80,000 francs, and\r\nwas scattered along the commercial highways of the world, never again\r\nto be reunited. One of the finest aqua-marines, mounted in sapphires\r\nand pearls, and engraved with the portrait of Julia, the daughter of\r\nTitus, was fortunately rescued, and may now be seen in the collection\r\nof the National Library of France. This splendid gem is of the unusual\r\nmagnitude of 2¹⁄₂ inches by 2¹⁄₈. For quite a thousand years it formed\r\na part of a golden reliquary celebrated as “l’escrain de Charlemagne.”\r\nHistory relates that it was presented by the great Emperor before his\r\ndeath to the Abbey of St. Denys. This is one of the finest specimens of\r\nan ancient intaglio carved upon beryl that has survived the destructive\r\npillage of armies and the wreck of time since the early days of the\r\nRoman Empire. It is said that specimens of antique engraving upon this\r\ngem are about as rare as those carved upon the emerald, and their\r\nrarity is believed to be due to their great value, as well as to their\r\nscarcity in the gem markets in ancient times.\r\n\r\nSeveral royal relics of the lower Empire containing emeralds are still\r\npreserved, to attest the use of the gem in those days as well as the\r\nesteem in which it was held. The famous Iron Crown of Lombardy, made\r\nperhaps before the sixth century, contains several emeralds. This\r\nrenowned relic is simply a circlet of gold, covering an iron nail\r\nof the cross, beaten out thin. The crown of the queen of one of the\r\nGothic kings of Spain, of the seventh century, was recently exhumed\r\nat Toledo, and also exhibits emeralds among other gems. And there are\r\nother examples to prove the use of the emerald in mediæval times for\r\nornamental purposes.\r\n\r\nNo other gem has been counterfeited with such perfection as the\r\nemerald; and in fact it is utterly impossible to distinguish the\r\nartificial from the real gems by the aid of the eye alone; even the\r\nlittle flaws, which lull the suspicions of the inexperienced, are\r\neasily produced by a dexterous blow from the mallet of the skilled\r\nartisan. Not only emeralds, but most of the gems and precious stones,\r\nare now imitated with such consummate skill as to deceive the eye; and\r\nnone but experts are aware of the extent to which these fictitious gems\r\nare worn in fashionable society, for oftentimes the wearers themselves\r\nimagine that they possess the real stones. There is not one in a\r\nhundred jewellers who is acquainted with the physical properties of the\r\ngems; and very few can distinguish the diamond from the white zircon or\r\nthe white topaz, the emerald from the tourmaline of similar hue, the\r\nsapphire from iolite, or the topaz from the Bohemian yellow quartz.\r\nJewellers are governed generally by sight, which they believe to be\r\ninfallible, whilst hardness and specific gravity are the only sure\r\ntests.\r\n\r\nArtificial gems, rivalling in beauty of color the most brilliant and\r\ndelicately tinted of the productions of Nature, are now made at Paris\r\nand in other European cities. The establishments at Septmoncel in the\r\nJura alone employed a thousand persons, and fabulous quantities of the\r\nglittering pastes were made there and sent to all parts of the world.\r\n\r\nA fine specimen of prase, when cut, affords a fair imitation of\r\nthe emerald. The green fluor-spar which Haüy called “emeraude de\r\nCarthagène” may also be substituted, but the application of the file\r\ndetects the trick with ease. Some of the green tourmalines approach the\r\nemeralds in hue very closely, and by artificial light it is impossible\r\nto distinguish them from each other. Fragments of quartz may be stained\r\nby being steeped in green-colored tinctures. The Greeks stained quartz\r\nso like the real gem, that Pliny exclaimed against the fraud, while\r\ndeclining to tell how it was done. The Ancona rubies at the present day\r\nare made by plunging quartz into a hot tincture of cochineal, which\r\npenetrates the minute fissures of the rock.\r\n\r\nBut notwithstanding the high art reached by modern glass-makers, they\r\nare yet far behind the ancients in imitating the emerald in point of\r\nhardness and lustre. Many emerald pastes of Roman times still extant\r\nare with difficulty distinguished from the real gem, so much harder and\r\nmore lustrous are they than modern glass. The ancient Phœnician remains\r\nfound in the island of Sardinia by Cavalier Cara, in 1856, show fine\r\ncolor in their enamels and glass-works. The green pigment brought home\r\nfrom the ruins of Thebes by Mr. Wilkinson, was shown by Dr. Ure to\r\nconsist of blue glass in powder, with yellow ochre and colorless glass.\r\nFrom Greek inscriptions dating from the period of the Peloponnesian\r\nwar, we learn that there were signets of colored glass among the gems\r\nin the treasury of the Parthenon.\r\n\r\nOf all the emerald imitations that have descended to us from antiquity,\r\nnone are more remarkable, none more interesting to the antiquary and\r\nhistorian, than the famous Sacro Catino of the cathedral of Genoa. This\r\ncelebrated relic is a glass dish, or patera, fourteen inches in width,\r\nfive inches in depth, and of the richest transparent green color,\r\nthough disfigured by several flaws. It was bestowed upon the Republic\r\nof Genoa by the Crusaders, after the capture of Cæsarea in 1101, and\r\nwas regarded as an equivalent for a large sum of money due from the\r\nChristian army. It was traditionally believed to have been presented\r\nto King Solomon by the Queen of Sheba, and afterward preserved in the\r\nTemple; and some accounts relate that it was used by Christ at the\r\ninstitution of the Lord’s supper. The Genoese received it with so\r\nmuch veneration and faith, that twelve nobles were appointed to guard\r\nit, and it was exhibited but once a year, when a priest held it up in\r\nhis hand to the view of the passing throng. The State, in 1319, in a\r\ntime of pressing need, pawned the holy relic for 1,200 marks of gold\r\n($200,000), and redeemed it with a promptness which proved its belief\r\nin the reality of the material, as well as in its sanctity. And it\r\nis also related that the Jews, during a period of fifty years, lent\r\nthe Republic 4,000,000 francs, holding the sacred relic as a pledge\r\nof security. Seven hundred years passed away, when Napoleon came; and\r\nas he swept down over Italy, gathering her art treasures, he ordered\r\nthe “Holy Grail” to be conveyed to Paris. It was deposited in the\r\nCabinet of Antiquities in the Imperial Library, and the mineralogists\r\nquickly discovered it to be glass. It is due to the memory of Condamine\r\nto state that he was the first to doubt the material of the Sacro\r\nCatino; for, when examining it by lamplight in 1757, in the presence\r\nof the Princes Corsini, he observed none of the cracks, clouds, and\r\nspecks common to emeralds, but detected little bubbles of air. In\r\n1815, the Allies ordered its return to the cathedral of Genoa. During\r\nthis journey the beautiful relic was broken; but its fragments were\r\nrestored by a skilful artisan, and it is now supported upon a tripod,\r\nthe fragments being held together by a band of gold filigree. This\r\nremarkable object of antiquity, which is of extraordinary beauty of\r\nmaterial and workmanship, furnishes a theme over which the antiquaries\r\nlove to muse and wrangle.\r\n\r\nAnother of the antique monster emeralds, weighing twenty-nine\r\npounds, was presented to the abbey of Reichenau, near Constance, by\r\nCharlemagne. Beckman has also detected this precious relic to be\r\nglass. And probably the great emerald of two pounds weight brought home\r\nfrom the Holy Land by one of the dukes of Austria, and now deposited in\r\nthe collection at Vienna, is of the same material. Another, more than\r\neight inches long, was preserved in the chapel of St. Wenceslaus at\r\nPrague. The hardness of our glass is yet far inferior to that of the\r\nancients; and even the ruby lustre of the potters of Umbria, which was\r\nso precious to the _dilettanti_ of the Cinque Cento period, has not\r\nbeen recovered.\r\n\r\nThe enormous emerald dishes and statues and obelisks described\r\nby Herodotus, Theophrastus, Appian, and others were undoubtedly\r\nconstructed of glass, and exhibited to the ignorant multitudes as\r\nformed of monster emeralds.\r\n\r\nOne of the most curious of these impositions was the sculptured lion\r\non the tomb of Hermias on the island of Cyprus, which had emerald eyes\r\nwhich shone so brightly as to frighten away the fish in the sea near by.\r\n\r\nThe wonderful “Table of Solomon” which formed a part of Alaric’s Roman\r\nspoils, and was taken by his Goths to Spain, where it was captured by\r\nthe Arab invaders and afterwards sent to Damascus, was probably another\r\nspecimen of the ingenuity of the glass-workers of Alexandria or Tyre.\r\nIt is described by one of the Arabian historians as of a marvellous\r\nbeauty, being formed of a single slab of solid emerald, encircled with\r\nrows of pearls, and supported on many feet composed of gems and gold.\r\n\r\nThe famous Barberini vase, found in one of the tombs of the Roman\r\nemperors, and exhibiting white figures upon a dark-blue ground, was\r\nlong thought to be carved from some variety of sardonyx, but proved\r\nin modern times to be of hard antique glass. Of similar material\r\nthe unique ewer in the Brescian Museum and the vases in the Palace\r\nBorbonico are composed, and all of these are of great antiquity. The\r\nsapphire cup of Theolinda, the once celebrated Queen of Lombardy, now\r\npreserved in the Cathedral at Monza, is glass.\r\n\r\nThere are but very few stones whose colors resemble that of the\r\nemerald, and therefore frauds are easily detected. A well-selected\r\nspecimen of prase may be passed as an inferior emerald, as well as\r\nthe translucent stones cut from the Chinese jade; but their want of\r\ntransparency offers a serious objection to them as a gem. The green\r\ntourmaline, when it approaches the emerald in hue, is of equal value.\r\nThe green zircon and the green spinel would be far superior to the\r\nemerald in brilliancy, and therefore of greater value to the amateur.\r\nThe chrome-green garnet of Hungary and the emerald-green garnet of\r\nSiberia would command a high price, if of pure color, as they surpass\r\nthe glucina emerald in eclat and are moreover exceedingly rare. The\r\nperidot may assume the exact hue of the Granada emerald. The glass\r\nimitations are almost _fac-similes_ in hue, and are far superior in\r\nbrilliancy to the mineral itself; but their softness, which readily\r\nyields to the file, betrays their nature without difficulty.\r\n\r\nSince the time of the Spanish Conquest, New Granada has furnished the\r\nworld with the most of its emeralds. The most famous mines are at\r\nMuzo, in the valley of Tunca, between the mountains of New Granada\r\nand Popayan, about seventy-five miles from Santa Fé de Bogota, where\r\nevery rock, it is said, contains an emerald. At present the supply of\r\nemeralds is very limited, owing to restrictions on trade, and want of\r\ncapital and energy in mining operations.\r\n\r\nBlue as well as green emeralds are found in the Cordillera of the\r\nCubillan. The Esmeraldas mines in Equador are said to have been worked\r\nsuccessfully at one period by the Jesuits. The Peruvians obtained many\r\nemeralds from the barren district of Atacama, and in the times of the\r\nConquest there were quarries on the River of Emeralds near Barbacoas.\r\nEmeralds of a poor quality are found at Limoges in France, and also in\r\nNorway. In some of the felspar quarries in Finland they occur in large\r\nthick crystals, several feet in thickness, of a fine color, but not\r\ntransparent.\r\n\r\nEmeralds are found in Siberia, and some of the localities may have\r\nfurnished to the ancients the Scythian gems which Pliny and others\r\nmention. In the Wald district magnificent crystals have been found\r\nembedded in mica-slate. One of these--a twin-crystal, now in the\r\nimperial cabinet at St. Petersburg--is seven inches long, four inches\r\nbroad, and weighs four and a half pounds. There is another mass in the\r\nsame collection which measures fourteen inches long by twelve broad\r\nand five thick, weighing sixteen and three-quarter pounds troy. This\r\ngroup shows twenty crystals from a half inch to five inches long, and\r\nfrom one to two inches broad. They were discovered by a peasant cutting\r\nwood near the summit of the mountain. His eye was attracted by the\r\nlustrous sparkling amongst the decomposed mica where the ground had\r\nbeen exposed by the uprooting of a tree by the violence of the wind. He\r\ncollected a number of the crystals, and brought them to Katharineburg\r\nand showed them to M. Kokawin, who recognized them and sent them to\r\nSt. Petersburg, where they were critically examined by Van Worth and\r\npronounced to be emeralds. One of these crystals was presented by the\r\nEmperor to Humboldt when he visited St. Petersburg, and it is now\r\ndeposited in the Berlin collection. Quite a number of emeralds are\r\nnow brought from the Siberian localities, and it is believed that\r\nenterprise and capital would produce a large supply of the gem.\r\n\r\nNear Salsberg, in the Tyrol, the emerald occurs in a mica-slate which\r\nappears on the face of a very steep precipice difficult of access,\r\nand about 8,700 feet above the sea-level. They are of good color, but\r\nmuch impaired in their transparency by foreign matter and imperfect\r\ncrystallization. Some of the finest stones yielded by this locality\r\nwere exhibited as cabinet specimens by the Emperor of Russia at the\r\nParis Exposition.\r\n\r\nThe supply of emeralds from South America is very limited, and\r\nmay be ascribed to want of skilful mining, as well as to climate,\r\nthe political condition of the country, and the indolence of its\r\ninhabitants. The localities cannot be exhausted, for they are too\r\nnumerous and extensive. The elevated regions in Granada admit of\r\nscientific exploration by Europeans, and at the present day the\r\nonly emerald-mining operations conducted in South America have been\r\nprosecuted near Santa Fé de Bogota by a French company, which has paid\r\nthe Government $14,000 yearly for the right of mining, all the emeralds\r\nobtained being sent to Paris to be cut by the lapidaries of that city.\r\nIn the Atacama districts, and along the banks of the River of Emeralds,\r\nthe physical obstructions are difficult to overcome; and pestilential\r\ndiseases of malignant character forbid the long sojourn of the\r\nEuropean. Yet the introduction of Chinese labor may prove successful\r\nand highly remunerative, since the coolie reared among the jungles and\r\nrice-swamps of Southern China is quite as exempt from malarial fevers\r\nas the negro.\r\n\r\nHassaurek was surprised not to find emeralds for sale at Guayaquil,\r\nas they had been found in abundance in Equador at the time of the\r\nConquest. The Alcalde of the region around the River Bechile gave\r\nStephenson, the traveller, three emeralds which were found in the sands\r\nat the mouth of the river.\r\n\r\nConcerning the emerald mines whence the ancients drew their supplies\r\nof gems, there remains but little positive information. They were\r\nundoubtedly established in Arabia, Africa, and Scythia, but all record\r\nof them is lost. As regards the Egyptian mines, modern travellers have\r\nproved their existence. At the ancient mines at Gebel Zabara, which\r\nwere worked in the time of the Ptolemies, M. Callaud found the tools of\r\nthe miners as they had left them, and also many inferior emeralds among\r\nthe _débris_ of the pits. Mehemet Ali attempted to reopen them, but was\r\nunsuccessful, as the matrix of the gem proved to be exhausted. This\r\ndiscovery establishes the truth of Pliny’s remark concerning some of\r\nthe localities of the emerald. They are the same gems whose beauty was\r\npraised by the Persian poets. We have no evidence of ancient mines of\r\nemeralds in Asia; and Tavernier, who sought in vain to discover them,\r\nventured to state that he believed that some of the emeralds he saw in\r\nIndia must have come from Peru, by way of the Philippine Islands, long\r\nbefore the Conquest by the Spaniards.\r\n\r\nOther mines undoubtedly were worked in Africa; and we know that in the\r\ntime of Justinian, the Abyssinians searched the coast, even as far as\r\nthe equator. The African emeralds were not of the first quality; and at\r\na later period of Roman history the Scythian emeralds were reckoned as\r\nthe first in value and beauty, the Bactrian second, while the African\r\nwere classed as third. About the fourth century the throne of the White\r\nHuns was famous for the splendid Scythian emeralds which adorned it.\r\n\r\nThe price of the emerald has no fixed and extended scale, like that\r\nof the diamond, and the fluctuations of its value during the past\r\nthree centuries form an interesting chapter in the history of gems.\r\nIn the time of Dutens (1777) the price of small stones of the first\r\nquality was one louis the karat; one and a half karats, five louis;\r\ntwo karats, ten louis; and beyond this weight no rule of value could\r\nbe established. In De Boot’s day (1600) emeralds were so plenty as\r\nto be worth only a quarter as much as the diamond. The markets were\r\nglutted with the frequent importations from Peru, and thirteen years\r\nbefore the above-mentioned period one vessel brought from South America\r\ntwo hundred and three pounds of fine emeralds, worth at the present\r\nvaluation more than seven millions of dollars. At the beginning\r\nof this century, according to Caire, they were worth no more than\r\ntwenty-four francs (or about five dollars) the karat, and for a long\r\ntime antecedent to 1850, they were valued at only $15 the karat.\r\nSince this period they have become very rare, and their valuation has\r\nadvanced enormously. In fact, the value of the emerald now exceeds that\r\nof the diamond, and is rapidly approaching the ratio fixed by Benvenuto\r\nCellini in the middle of the sixteenth century, which rated the emerald\r\nat four times, and the ruby at eight times, the value of the diamond.\r\nFine stones (the emerald is exceedingly liable to flaw, the beryl is\r\nmore free, and the green sapphire is rarely impaired by fissures or\r\ncracks) of one karat in weight are worth at the present day $200 or\r\nmore. Fine gems of two karats weight will command $500; while larger\r\nstones are sold at extravagant prices.\r\n\r\nMost of our aqua-marines come from Brazil and Siberia, and small stones\r\nare sold at trifling prices. Some of them, however, when perfect and\r\nof fine color, command fabulous sums. The superb little beryl found at\r\nMouzzinskaia is valued by the Russians at the enormous sum of $120,000,\r\nalthough the crystal weighs but little more than one ounce. Another\r\nrough prism preserved in the Museum at Paris, and weighing less than\r\none hundred grains, has received the tempting offer of 15,000 francs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               THE OPAL.\r\n\r\n  “What radiant changes strike the astonished sight!\r\n  What glowing hues of mingled shade and light!”\r\n\r\n  FALCONER.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               THE OPAL.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is the composition of this wonderful stone, which displays such\r\nwondrous hues? What is the nature of this remarkable mineral, which\r\nseems to concentrate within its substance all the glories of the\r\nrainbow, and which rivals in its hue the finest gem of the mineral\r\nworld? The Turk believes that it falls from heaven in the lightning’s\r\nflash, and it is often regretted by the mineralogist that the theory\r\ncannot be sustained. Surely a gem so beautiful, so delicate and so\r\npure ought to be of celestial origin, and free from the impurities and\r\nimperfections of the earth. Alas, we have but one precious stone that\r\ncomes to us from the far-off region of celestial space,--olivine,--and\r\nthat as yet has been found only in minute grains.\r\n\r\nBut if we cannot ascribe the origin of our beautiful gems directly to\r\nthe stars and other bodies in space, we may affirm that their birth or\r\ndevelopment in the bosom of our earth may be due in a great measure to\r\nextra-terrestrial influences. And as regards the precious opal, if we\r\ncannot prove it of divine origin, we can with truth affirm that there\r\nis a deep mystery connected with the mineral both in its composition\r\nand its physical properties. The liberal-minded physicist to-day finds\r\nhimself somewhat baffled when attempting to explain the phenomena of\r\nthe gem in accordance with our imperfect knowledge of natural laws.\r\nApparently it is nothing more than hydrated silica or quartz; but it is\r\nof a lower specific gravity, and some of its varieties are so tender\r\nand delicate in structure as to be at the caprice of the atmosphere.\r\n\r\nIt has been maintained that the peculiarities of the opal depend in\r\na great measure upon the quantity of water it contained, and which,\r\nmixed mechanically with the silica, varies from three to twenty per\r\ncent. But some chemists who have interested themselves in the study\r\nof the composition of the mineral do not regard the presence of water\r\nas absolutely essential for the development of the varied flashes of\r\ncolor. We will only state in this brief sketch that there is certainly\r\na mystery connected with the part water plays in producing and\r\nperfecting the beauty of the opal. This quantity or factor of water\r\nvaries greatly in the different varieties of opal. Apparently when heat\r\nis applied to the mineral the brilliancy of its hues is increased,\r\neither from evaporation of its water or some structural change. But\r\nif the degree of heat is too great, or its application too prolonged,\r\nthe hues of the opal vanish and cannot be recalled by human skill. The\r\nsame results from the effects of heat may be noticed in other gems\r\nof greater density and hardness, as the emerald, the topaz, and the\r\ntourmaline. It has been maintained that a faded opal may be restored to\r\nbeauty by immersion for a time in water, with the view of restoring the\r\nfancied loss by evaporation; but we fear that the experimentalist will\r\nbe often disappointed with his results. However, there is one singular\r\nvariety of the mineral known as the hydrophane, which does not exhibit\r\ncolors until after it has been immersed for a time in water, and when\r\nremoved from its bath and becomes dry again its hues vanish. Therefore,\r\nwe may justly affirm that there is a mystery in connection with the\r\ninfluence of water in producing the color of the opal. The optical\r\nproperties of this mineral do not afford decisive distinction, and it\r\nnever crystallizes in regular and definite form like quartz, neither\r\ndoes it exhibit a trace of double refraction.\r\n\r\nWe will say no more at present concerning the composition of this\r\ninteresting substance except to allude briefly to the experiment of\r\nDamour, who found the opal to turn black when sulphuric acid was\r\napplied to it; hence he inferred that the substance contained some\r\norganic matter, but precisely what he could not determine, although\r\nhe suspected the presence of bituminous matter. Similar foreign\r\nbodies have been detected in many other precious stones. In fact,\r\nmany of our gems are impaired by impurities; and so generally, that\r\na stone of absolute purity is of rare occurrence. Even the diamond,\r\nwhich is regarded as the emblem of light and purity, is reckoned by\r\nmicroscopists as one of the foulest of gems.\r\n\r\nWerner divided the opal into four sub-species, and Jameson has\r\nseparated it into seven varieties. The principal divisions, however,\r\nmay be classed as follows: precious or noble opal, presenting refulgent\r\ntints; fire opal, with fire-like reflections; girasole, with reddish\r\nreflections when exposed to the sunlight; common opal, translucent\r\nand without reflections; wood opal or petrified opal, possessing the\r\ncharacters of common opal; hyalite, clear and colorless as glass.\r\nThere is another kind of opal which we have never seen, but which is\r\ndescribed as the asteriated opal. We are not able to give a minute\r\ndescription of its appearance or draw a comparison between it and that\r\nof asteriated quartz, sapphire, or garnet. It is said to display great\r\nbeams of light which undulate over its surface like the flashings of\r\nlightning piercing the storm cloud. The variety known as the moss opal\r\nsometimes displays in its interior dendritic crystallization of a dark\r\nsubstance resembling delicate mosses, ferns, or trees. And the gleam of\r\nthe colored rays flashing amidst these miniature forests and groups of\r\nfoliage often present charming effects.\r\n\r\nThe grand characteristic which gives to the gem its value and renown is\r\nthe wonderful play of the colored reflections which it displays, and\r\nwhich embrace all of the prismatic tints of the solar spectrum. As we\r\nview its vivid rainbow flashes when the gem is held in the sunlight,\r\nwe must admit it to be the most magnificent of gems, and join with the\r\nLatin philosopher, who remarked that it was made up of the glories\r\nof the most precious stones. For as the light falls upon it in varied\r\ndirections, its reflections recall the lively green of the emerald, or\r\nthe tender blue of the sapphire, the rich yellow of the topaz, or the\r\ngorgeous red of the ruby.\r\n\r\nThis mineral has not only been an object of delight to the fashionable\r\nworld, but it has also been a wonder and a perplexity to the\r\nphilosophers. In admiring its beauties and attempting to account for\r\nits phenomena, Newton was led to the series of experiments and to that\r\ntrain of sublime reasoning that gave to science the most brilliant\r\nand extraordinary of his discoveries. The colored refractions of the\r\ngem reminded the philosopher of the iridescence of the soap-bubble,\r\nand the soap-bubble suggested the undulatory theory of light. Newton,\r\nafter long study of the opal, is said to have declared that its hues\r\nwere produced by the refractions and reflections of light at the\r\nnumerous minute fissures which traverse the stone in all directions.\r\nBut this theory is denied by many at the present day, and especially by\r\nMohrs, who maintains that the thin films of air filling the cavities\r\nof the stone would produce iridescence only. Other opticians believe\r\nthe colored reflections to be due to laminæ formed by incipient\r\ncrystallization, as seen in the equally remarkable mineral known as\r\nlabradorite. Babinet believes the brilliant colors of the opal to be\r\ndue to the narrow fissures in the stone, like those produced in the\r\npartial fracture of glass or quartz. He also refers for example to\r\nthe colors of thin transparent plates, and believes that the colors\r\nof flowers are produced in like manner from the overlaying of the\r\ntransparent tissues of which the petals are composed. This, then,\r\naccording to the French philosopher, is the secret of the gorgeous\r\nhues of vegetation from their first development to the period of their\r\nfinal decay. The diamond, when cut in a regular form, displays the most\r\nmagnificent flashes of the prismatic hues by artificial light; and\r\nalthough the mineral is composed of an infinite number of laminæ, no\r\none maintains the theory that the color is produced by thin films of\r\nair like those in the soap-bubble. We also may observe the same hues\r\nsparkling among the dew-drops in the morning sunlight, and likewise\r\nin the artificial diamonds, which are composed of solid glass and\r\napparently homogeneous.\r\n\r\nIn examining the interior of an opal, we often fail to perceive any\r\ncause for the reflections of color, especially in the limpid varieties.\r\nThe flashes appear when the light enters the stone at a certain angle,\r\nbut when viewed in any other direction the gem presents the usual\r\nappearance of common transparent quartz. In other varieties of the\r\nmineral, however, especially the milky or translucent, a cause for\r\nthe colored reflections is easily observed. We have under observation\r\nthe beautiful opal known as the “Oberon,” and beneath its translucent\r\nsurface appear thin films of a faint reddish hue suspended at different\r\ndepths within its interior. They are so well defined that their edges\r\nmay be recognized, and they lie like thin clouds suspended in a hazy\r\nsky. But as the gem is turned so that the light strikes the film at a\r\ndifferent angle, the scene is instantly changed, and a mass of flame\r\nreplaces the sombre tint. It is a little curious that some of the films\r\nexhibit the different colors of the spectrum as the angle of light is\r\nchanged, while others display only the green and blue color, no matter\r\nhow the light strikes them. In fact, the films or patches, which are\r\napparently alike, produce different results from the same rays of\r\nlight; and some display the continuous spectrum, while others exhibit\r\nbut one color. It is a little singular that all transparent minerals\r\nwhen fractured do not exhibit alike in their fractures the prismatic\r\ngleams displayed by quartz and glass. We have before us a beautiful\r\ntransparent white crystal of adularia or moon-stone from St. Gothard,\r\nand although it is fissured and fractured in a thousand places, yet we\r\nobserve little iridescence in it even when exposed to the sunlight.\r\n\r\nThe localities where the precious opal is now found are but few, and\r\nnone of them were probably known to the ancients. All record of the\r\nold opal mines is now lost; but there were undoubtedly deposits of the\r\nmineral in Arabia, Syria, and in Asia, whence the ancients derived\r\ntheir gems. The famous Hungarian mines were not discovered until late\r\nin the fifteenth century, and the country was quite unknown to the\r\nRomans.\r\n\r\nThe principal mines explored at the present day, and whence most of our\r\nopals are now derived, are those of Hungary and Honduras. The Hungarian\r\nmines are of great extent and are now scientifically explored, but\r\nthose of Central America are undetermined and but rudely mined. It is\r\nbelieved that there are other mines in Central America besides those of\r\nHonduras, for the natives at times bring fine specimens to the coast\r\nfrom localities widely separated. It is quite true that most of the\r\nopals of America are less hard than the Hungarian, but they are no\r\nless brilliant, and some of them withstand atmospheric effects and the\r\nwear of time quite as well. The Honduras opals are found near Gracias\r\na Dios in porcelain earth, and are extracted in irregular masses,\r\nsometimes uniform or globular concretions, with rough and deeply\r\nindented surfaces. These masses do not exhibit the least tendency to\r\ncrystallization like quartz, and they are generally quite small. Their\r\nnatural colors are pale, and vary from brown to a pearly gray. They\r\noften exhibit a rich and varied play of the rainbow hues, even in their\r\nnatural and rough condition. But sometimes, when this rough exterior is\r\nremoved by the lapidary’s wheel, and the gem is highly polished, the\r\ncolors vanish as if by magic. The polished stone no longer displays\r\na single ray of the brilliant fires which illuminated every angle of\r\nthe stone when in its rough state. This singular disappearance may be\r\nexplained by the theory that the surface has been too highly polished,\r\nand the substance of the stone is rendered too transparent to permit\r\nthe requisite degree of reflection, for when the surface is slightly\r\nroughened the play of colors again returns. The finest specimens\r\nare therefore those which are translucent, or those which, being\r\ntransparent, are backed by an opaque ground which refracts the light.\r\n\r\nThe opal-bearing districts in Central America are far more extensive\r\nthan is generally supposed. The Province of Honduras abounds in them,\r\nand we have evidence of others occurring in the State of Guatemala on\r\nthe Pacific coast. The following descriptions of some of the opal mines\r\nof Honduras were published by Dr. J. Le Conte, in 1868, in his report\r\nof the Inter-oceanic Railroad survey:--\r\n\r\n “Extensive beds of common opal and semi-opal are seen along a belt\r\n extending through the central part of the department of Gracias; but\r\n these varieties, though very beautiful and possessing high interest\r\n to the mineralogist, are without commercial value from the ease with\r\n which artificial products may be made which precisely resemble them.\r\n The localities worthy of exploration are those in which the opal\r\n forms veins (not beds) in compact but brittle trachyte of a dark\r\n color. The veins, as will be seen, are not confined to such rock, but\r\n seem to have their origin in it, and are probably not found except\r\n in connection with it. The best-known mines of precious opal are in\r\n the department of Gracias; several localities have yielded valuable\r\n gems, but they are all remote from the line of road. Some are in the\r\n vicinity of the town of Gracias, others near Intibucat; but the most\r\n important are at Erandique. The working is now carried on in a very\r\n small way; but the locality is extensive, and in my opinion mining\r\n on a large scale would be attended with profit. The country near by\r\n abounds with beds of common opal, as in many other places, but the\r\n gems occur in somewhat irregular veins running in a northeast and\r\n southwest direction, and with a nearly perpendicular dip. The veins\r\n are not continuous, but branch off and disappear at short intervals;\r\n neither are the contents of uniform quality, but the valuable parts\r\n are usually in belts in the vein, and limited on each side by portions\r\n of ordinary opal without play of colors. These lines of light are\r\n sometimes numerous and narrow, alternating with the common opal\r\n forming a very beautiful gem. Many again, even of large size, are\r\n uniform in structure, and exhibit a play of colors as brilliant as the\r\n finest opals from Hungary. The hill in which they are found is about\r\n two hundred and fifty feet high, and two or three miles in length, and\r\n for a width of half a mile for its whole length opals have been found\r\n wherever excavations have been made. The rock in which they occur is\r\n a hard, brittle trachyte of a vitreous lustre, and splintering into\r\n acute fragments when struck; a bed several feet in thickness overlying\r\n this rock is of a gray color and soft consistence, and also contains\r\n opal veins; it is probably a trachyte changed by atmospheric action.\r\n\r\n “Other localities within two leagues of Erandique have furnished very\r\n fine opals, but as they are not now worked I did not visit them. Many\r\n places on the road between Intibucat and Las Piedras appear favorable\r\n to the existence of opal mines; but only careful scrutiny by a number\r\n of explorers can discover them. I would mention as most worthy of\r\n future attention the vicinity of Lepasale and of Yucusapa and the\r\n ascent of the great mountain of Santa Rosa. Greater expectations and\r\n indeed almost certain success will attend the search for opal mines\r\n in the valley leading from Tambla towards the pass of Guayoca, nearly\r\n on the line of the proposed road. Within half a mile of Tambla are\r\n immense beds of common opal of various shades of color. Near Guayoca\r\n are banded opals of alternate layers of opaque and semi-transparent\r\n white, having the appearance of onyx; these occur in a red vitreous\r\n trachyte and sometimes in contact with the masses of petrified wood\r\n which strew the ground for a considerable distance. Veins of a\r\n pearl-colored opal, with red reflections, are also found here; they\r\n have no commercial value, but serve as indications of better things in\r\n the neighborhood.\r\n\r\n “Between the two localities mentioned (that near Tambla and that of\r\n Guayoca), Mr. W. W. Wright, chief assistant of the survey, has, by\r\n following some obscure indications, arrived at a vein of very pretty\r\n glassy opals and yellow fire opals, not of great value, but serving to\r\n strengthen the opinion expressed of the ultimate discovery of precious\r\n opals in the vicinity. Near Choluteca are found fire opals, some of\r\n which I was told possess merit. One (not of the best) given me is\r\n precisely similar to those obtained by Mr. Wright near Tambla. Within\r\n one league of Goascoran, as I am informed by Fernando Gaillardo, a\r\n resident of that town, is a mine producing opals with a good play of\r\n colors.”\r\n\r\nAnother remarkable deposit of opal was found by Mr. Wright about five\r\nmiles east of Villa San Antonio in the plains of Camayagua. Though not\r\nof high value, it may be of use for ornamental purposes, being of a\r\nfine red color with transparent amethystine bands. It occurs in veins\r\nin gray porphyry, sometimes several inches thick, and may be procured\r\nin large quantities. Precious opal has been discovered in the iron\r\nmines at Barcoo in Queensland, and a number of specimens were exhibited\r\nat Philadelphia, at the Centennial. Some of these specimens were very\r\nfair, and gave promise of choice gems. The blue tints displayed by some\r\nof them were of great purity. They appeared to be of the hard variety,\r\nand therefore less liable to be affected by the ravages of time, or\r\ninfluence of exposure.\r\n\r\nWe will not fatigue our readers with a long dissertation on the\r\nformation of the opal. We will however, quote one theory which all may\r\nunderstand.\r\n\r\nThe boiling waters of the Iceland geyser are projected into the air\r\nat a considerable height, and are heavily charged with silica. As the\r\nwaters fall upon the earth, large piles of earthy and stony material\r\nare formed in process of time. When these silicious masses are broken\r\nopen, translucent and transparent portions of silica are found,\r\nexhibiting the colored reflections of the noble opal as long as they\r\nremain hydrated, or, in other words, as long as they retain a certain\r\nquantity of water in their composition. This observation has led\r\nM. Descloizeaux to the belief that opals found in volcanic rocks or\r\nigneous rocks have had their origin in phenomena analogous to those of\r\nthe Iceland geysers. The matrix of the opal is a varied one. The gem is\r\nnot only found in porcelain earth, but it occurs in fissures and seams,\r\nin what appear to be old igneous rocks. It has also been deposited in\r\nrecent periods, as in the limestones of the argillaceous beds, and even\r\nin the formations of the silicious waters of the hot springs of the\r\npresent time. The decomposed cement of the old Roman ruins around the\r\nhot springs of Polombieres, uniting with certain chemical properties of\r\nthe waters, has changed into opal and hyalite. Trees within historic\r\ntimes have been transformed into opal or semi-opal; and on the island\r\nof Unja one may see blocks and trunks of trees (some even showing the\r\nmarks of the hatchet) converted into opal. Silicified trees forty or\r\nfifty feet in length, may be seen stretched from Cairo to Suez. In many\r\nother parts of the world trees and plants have been transformed by the\r\nmysterious processes of nature into a silicious substance possessing\r\nthe characters of opal; but none of these vegetable metamorphoses\r\nexhibit the rainbow hues to any marked degree. Quartz, when flawed in\r\nthe interior, sometimes exhibits a remarkable iridescence, and may\r\nimitate the opal, especially if viewed at a distance. Such specimens\r\nof iridized quartz are called “iris,” and they may be artificially\r\nproduced by a sudden blow upon the stone, or by heating it and\r\nsuddenly dropping it into cold water. The superb iris ornaments worn by\r\nthe Empress Josephine were of remarkable brilliancy and play of colors.\r\nIn ancient and mediæval times, iridescent quartz was held in great\r\nesteem; and fine specimens mounted in antique jewelry are preserved at\r\nthe present day. It is described in the “Lapidarium” of Marbodeus as\r\nfollows:--\r\n\r\n  “By the Red Sea the swarthy Arabs glean\r\n  The iris, splendent with the crystal’s sheen;\r\n  Its form six-sided, full of heaven’s own light,\r\n  Has justly gained the name of rainbow bright.”\r\n\r\nThe fire opal occurs in its greatest perfection in the porphyritic\r\nrocks at Zimapan in Mexico. It is generally of a translucent\r\nhyacinth-red color and flashes forth dazzling beams of fiery\r\ncarmine-red with yellow and green reflections. This Mexican gem is the\r\nmost beautiful and gorgeous of all the varieties of opal; but, alas!\r\nit is also the most sensitive, and is frequently irreparably injured\r\nby water or exposure, or even by sudden atmospheric changes. So easily\r\naffected are the opals by the vicissitudes of the weather that they\r\nare almost always brighter in summer than in winter. But there are\r\nsome varieties that are not so easily influenced, and are not injured\r\nby contact with water. The fact that this variety of opal is injured\r\nin course of time by contact with moisture or careless exposure is not\r\nremarkable when some of the harder gems undergo a change from similar\r\nexposure. The hard amethystine quartz, when worn as a finger ornament,\r\nwill completely bleach out and become colorless in a few years. The\r\nblack opal is the product of art, and for this purpose harlequin opals\r\nare used. The harlequin opal is simply the matrix of other gems spotted\r\nhere and there with flakes of color dispersed over an opaque ground,\r\nand its name was suggested by the resemblance to the motley tints of\r\nthe harlequin’s dress. Masses of the matrix, with fragments or specks\r\nof opal interspersed in its substance, are soaked for a time in a\r\nsaccharine solution, and afterwards in diluted sulphuric acid. The\r\nporous parts of the matrix absorb a minute quantity of the solution,\r\nwhich is afterwards charred by the sulphuric acid; while the solid and\r\ntransparent parts remain unchanged and exhibit an increased play of\r\ncolors upon the black ground.\r\n\r\nThe ancients undoubtedly obtained their opals from Syria and Arabia\r\nor other Eastern countries, for the Hungarian mines which now supply\r\nthe world with most of the finest gems were not discovered until the\r\nfifteenth century. The famous mines are situated on a mountain which\r\nis one of the spurs of the Carpathians. They belong to the Seignory\r\nPeklin, and are near the village of Czernizka. In the early days of\r\ntheir discovery, and for a long period afterwards, they were explored\r\ncasually and from time to time. At the present day, however, the\r\nexplorations are conducted with regularity and the appliances of\r\nskilled labor. The surface of the mountain has been removed to a great\r\nextent during this long-continued search of many centuries, but as yet\r\nno explorations have been attempted into the interior of the ledges.\r\nThe true matrix appears not to be more than four to eight yards in\r\ndepth below the alluvial soil. It is arranged in continuous beds of\r\nlittle hardness, but resembling porphyry in color. The opal formation\r\nappears to extend to a considerable distance beyond the flanks of the\r\nmountain; for, in the cultivated fields below, the laborers often find\r\nbeautiful gems washed out by violent rain-storms from the exposed and\r\nsuperficial soils.\r\n\r\nThe opals from these mines are the hardest and most enduring of all the\r\nknown localities of the earth, yet they have to be carefully tempered\r\nto heat and moisture before they can be utilized. M. Frangoll Delius,\r\nthe Commissioner of the Austrian mines, states that these opals, when\r\nfirst extracted from their rocky beds, are soft, friable, and tender,\r\nand not in a condition to be worked. But after they have been exposed\r\nto the air and sunlight for some days or a definite time, they become\r\nharder, and the stones also become decidedly smaller from contraction.\r\nThis exposure is required to be carefully regulated lest the stone\r\nbecome fissured by sudden contraction. When exposed to the effects of\r\nartificial heat, colors appear sooner than when it is submitted to the\r\naction of the sun’s rays. It is curious to watch the gradual unfolding\r\nand the display of these beautiful hues. At first the stone is limpid\r\nand rayless as pellucid quartz. But as the quarry water is evaporated\r\nby the effect of heat or time, and the stone contracts in volume, the\r\niridized reflections then begin to appear, increasing in perfection and\r\nvariety, until the requisite degree of moisture is expelled. If this\r\nevaporation is carried too far by heat the splendors of the gem vanish\r\ncompletely, never to be recalled. It is a singular fact that exposure\r\nto the sun’s rays gives the opal much finer hues than the action of\r\nartificial heat. And it is also a remarkable circumstance that of\r\nall the variety of prismatic hues displayed by this gem, the violet\r\ninvariably appears the first, according to M. Delius.\r\n\r\nThe ancients rarely engraved upon the opal, influenced perhaps partly\r\nfrom its enormous value in those times, and partly from its soft and\r\nfragile nature. They imitated the gem, however, with such perfection\r\nthat Pliny declared that it was almost impossible to distinguish\r\nthe false from the real. Modern gem imitators have utterly failed\r\nin producing anything approaching the precious opal in beauty. The\r\nassertion of Pliny in regard to the imitation of the glories of this\r\ngem has always been received with incredulity by the moderns on account\r\nof the failures of our most skilled artisans; but the discoveries among\r\nthe ancient Phœnician tombs in the island of Cyprus by Di Cesnola\r\nrather strengthen Pliny’s remark.\r\n\r\nIn this collection we may view a great and elegant variety of\r\nglass-ware exhumed from the tombs of the Phœnician nobility who\r\nlived three thousand years ago or more. Many of these vessels gleam\r\nwith what appear to be iridescent tints of gold, blue, red, and other\r\ncolors of the loveliest tints, recalling to mind the most beautiful and\r\ngorgeous reflections of the opal. Some of the articles are entirely\r\nof one color, while others are composed of patches of various hues\r\nresembling enormous opals with broad gleams of pure color. Peligot\r\nmaintains that these superb colors are clue to the effect of great\r\nage; and the substance of the glass being separated into laminæ, the\r\ncolors may be explained by the law of iridescence. But we are half\r\ninclined to believe that they may be due to the skill of the artisan in\r\na great measure,--hence the variety of color in different vessels of\r\nthe same age. In the famous collection of Signor Castellani there is a\r\nsolid glass ring quite two inches in diameter taken from the ancient\r\nEtruscan tombs. This interesting relic exhibits patches of color as\r\nbright as the prismatic gleams, and they do not appear to arise from\r\nany disintegration of the material, but rather to be produced by the\r\ndesign of the workman. We surely will not ascribe to effect of age\r\nthe decided iridescent glaze which we see in the Maiolica pottery of\r\nHispano-Moresque objects of the thirteenth or fifteenth centuries, or\r\nin the Gubbio products of the sixteenth century.\r\n\r\nThe famous opal of history was that which was worn in a ring by the\r\nRoman Senator Nonius in the days of the Triumvirate. Its size scarcely\r\nexceeded that of a hazel-nut, yet its beauty and perfection were such\r\nthat it was considered a marvel among the _dilettanti_ of Rome, and\r\nvalued at the enormous sum of nearly a million dollars. Marc Antony,\r\nremembering the sacrifice of the matchless pearl by Cleopatra, and\r\nstill enslaved by her irresistible charms, sought to obtain the opal,\r\nintending it as a present to the siren queen of Egypt. But Nonius\r\nrefused to part with the treasure which was the idol of his heart,\r\nand sought safety in flight. The beauty and charm of the gem may be\r\nestimated by the fact that banishment then to a Roman was worse than\r\ndeath. History makes no further mention of this wonderful opal, and\r\neven if preserved among the spoils of ancient Byzantium its glories\r\nhave probably vanished ere this, yielding to the destructive effects of\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nThe finest opal of modern times was that which was worn by the Empress\r\nJosephine in the days of Imperial splendor. It was indeed a magnificent\r\ngem. Its flashing beams of light were so strong and vivid as to\r\ngive the appearance of living flames of fire, and hence the name of\r\n_l’incendie de Troie_,--“the burning of Troy,”--was bestowed upon it.\r\nThe base of this opal was completely opaque, but the superior portion\r\nwas perfectly transparent, and through it were reflected a multitude of\r\nfiery gleams of red light. The fate of this beautiful gem is unknown.\r\nThere are two splendid opals still to be seen among the Crown jewels\r\nof France, notwithstanding the frequent change of dynasties. One is\r\nplaced in the centre of the Order of the Toison d’Or, and the other\r\nforms the clasp of the royal mantle.\r\n\r\nIn the imperial cabinet at Vienna is exhibited the grandest specimen of\r\nthis gem yet discovered. It was found in the mines of Hungary in 1770,\r\nand purchased by the Austrian Government. It measures 3³⁄₄ inches in\r\nlength, and is 2¹⁄₂ inches in thickness. Its weight is about seventeen\r\nounces, and its value is estimated at about $300,000. Although it\r\nis injured by several cracks and fissures, it possesses a brilliant\r\nplay of color, and is justly regarded as the finest specimen known,\r\neven surpassing the beautiful fire opal brought home from Mexico by\r\nHumboldt, and which is still preserved in the museum at Berlin.\r\n\r\nAt the close of the last century, but before the Revolution broke out\r\nin France, Mons. D’Auguy, a financier of Paris, came in possession\r\nof a most remarkable opal of the harlequin variety. It was of oval\r\nform, ⁷⁄₈ of an inch in length by ⁵⁄₈ in breadth. This gem was of\r\nwondrous beauty, and was pronounced perfect by the connoisseurs. It\r\nis now in the hands of the family of Count Waliski. At the same time\r\nthe well-known amateur Fleury owned a rival to Auguy’s opal, which it\r\nexceeded slightly in size.\r\n\r\nAnother magnificent opal is described by Jackson as having been\r\nexhibited at Vienna. It was nearly an inch in length, and was of the\r\nharlequin order, having three longitudinal bands from which flashed\r\nresplendent flames of light and color. It was pronounced by the\r\nvirtuosi of Dresden and Vienna to be the third in rank of all the fine\r\nopals then known.\r\n\r\nIn the Musée de Minéralogie of Paris may be seen a splendid opal which\r\nhas been carved into a bust of Louis XIII. when a child. King very\r\nproperly exclaims against the barbarism and extravagance where work and\r\nmaterial mutually destroy each other’s beauty and value. The Spanish\r\nhistorians, in their marvellous stories of the wonders seen in Mexico\r\nat the time of the Conquest, describe the image of the mystic deity\r\nQuetzalcoatl (God of the air) on the great pyramid of Cholula, as\r\nwearing a mitre waving with plumes of fire, and which was supposed to\r\nhave been produced by masses of the fire opal.\r\n\r\nDr. Le Conte brought home from his geological surveys in Honduras, a\r\nnumber of beautiful opals from the mines in that country. They have\r\nsince been cut and mounted in gold with diamond settings, in the form\r\nof a necklace, which is regarded by connoisseurs as one of the most\r\nvaluable jewels in the United States.\r\n\r\nAt the Centennial Exhibition of the United States, Austria exhibited\r\nsome very beautiful opals of various kinds, both polished and in the\r\nnatural state. One of the polished gems was two inches in diameter and\r\nvalued at $25,000. It was of a faint milky white tint, like most of\r\nthe Hungarian opals, and displayed a charming arrangement of colors.\r\n\r\nThe splendors of the opal are best seen when exposed to the direct rays\r\nof the sun, and viewed through a magnifying glass of low power. The\r\ndazzling scene has no equal in art or nature, for the vivid hues of the\r\nsolar spectrum are here displayed with the most charming effect. The\r\ncolors are in broad patches and not blended with their complementary\r\nhues as seen in the continuous spectrum, and the effects of the pure\r\ngreen, red, blue, and yellow, flashing forth in perfect purity and\r\nintensity, without definite arrangement, remind the observer of the\r\nbrilliancy of the kaleidoscope. In this fascinating display of hues one\r\nmight expect to see the colors pass into each other as in the solar\r\nspectrum, and as the field of view is changed; but such is not always\r\nthe result. The red may exhibit a tinge of yellow, or the green a shade\r\nof blue before they disappear from view; but generally the patch of\r\ncolor ends abruptly, preserving its purity of tint to the last.\r\n\r\nThe alternate and irregular flashing of all these varied hues always\r\npresents a harmonious spectacle, such is the wondrous power of Nature\r\nin all her arrangements and groupings. The stone, when arranged by\r\nthe art of the lapidary, is almost always cut with a convex surface.\r\nHowever, when the opal is attached to an opaque substance which serves\r\nas a reflector to the rays of light, the stone may then have its\r\nsurface cut almost flat. The colors displayed by this gem embrace\r\nquite all of the tints seen in the solar spectrum, and they are as\r\npure. The shades of green, blue, yellow, and red will bear comparison\r\nwith the hues of the solar spectrum, and the gems of other minerals\r\nare rare that can bear this decisive test. Sometimes but one color is\r\nvisible in the stone, and then it is called emerald or golden opal,\r\naccording to the tint exhibited.\r\n\r\nThe purchase of opals in the rough natural state is attended with\r\ndanger, for often the glittering mass, after being shaped and polished\r\nby the lapidary, is transformed into a transparent but hueless stone.\r\nThe cutting of the opal is always a hazardous operation, from the\r\nfragility of the material and the special tact required in determining\r\nthe shape to be given the gem. We will relate an instance to illustrate\r\nthe history of the whole.\r\n\r\nA traveller from Central America brought home a splendid rough fire\r\nopal which dazzled the eye with its fiery reflections. We took it to\r\nan honest lapidary, who received it with a doubtful look. The next day\r\nthe opal was returned, having been shaped into the usual oval form,\r\nbut only a faint gleam of any of the colored rays flashed from its\r\nsurface, or the interior. “Is this the gem we gave you yesterday?” we\r\ndemanded of the artisan. With a smile the lapidary took the transparent\r\nstone and roughened its finely polished surface upon the wooden\r\nwheel. In an instant the lost fire returned as if directed by magic’s\r\nwand. The perfect transparency of the gem, with its high polish,\r\nhad allowed the rays of light to pass directly through it, and there\r\nwas but little refraction, but on roughening the surface the light\r\nwas interrupted and the peculiar property of the mineral displayed.\r\nUnfortunately the lesson was not concluded here. At the last touch\r\nof the wheel the beautiful gem flew into two parts, and its glories\r\ndeparted in an instant. Saddened with the day’s experience, we took\r\nthe two fragments, cemented them together, and tossed the stone into a\r\ndrawer which contained other mineral specimens of no great value. Some\r\nmonths after, while searching for a misplaced mineral, a gleam of light\r\nsuddenly flashed out as we opened the drawer. It was the neglected and\r\nabused opal, which now gleamed with the energy of a living coal of\r\nfire. It had recovered its beautiful reflections, and still adorns,\r\nnotwithstanding its fracture, a most cherished jewel.\r\n\r\nWhence this mysterious change? the reader may ask. We can only say that\r\nthe complete transparency of the stone had been lessened, and perhaps\r\nthe change was due to the action of some of the ingredients of the\r\ncement with which we united the fragments of the broken gem.\r\n\r\nSome of the Central American opals have the reputation of fading and\r\nbecoming translucent and opaque in course of time, or according to the\r\ncircumstances of exposure. We will relate an instance which forms a\r\npart of our experience and education in the study of gems.\r\n\r\nA few years ago, two Spaniards arrived in New York with a bag of rough\r\nopals brought from Central America, but from what particular locality\r\nwe never learned. The specimens varied in size from that of a bean to\r\nthat of an English walnut, and were extremely beautiful. They had a\r\nfresh appearance, as though they had been recently extracted from the\r\nmines, and many of them had portions of the soft sandy matrix still\r\nattached to them. They excited suspicions of not having been properly\r\ntempered and hardened by exposure; but their beauty, which reminded\r\none of the perfect glow-worm, or lumps of phosphorus moistened with\r\noil, did not allow the spectator to hesitate about the purchase of\r\nthem, especially as they were offered at a moderate price. We invested\r\nin the purchase of several charming specimens, and never wearied in\r\nexamining their exquisite effects. Still, we felt a vague suspicion\r\nof the enduring qualities of our newly acquired treasures. The most\r\nbeautiful stone, the size of a small almond, we carried in our pocket\r\nfor a long time, not only for our gratification but for the purpose of\r\nstudying the effect of the atmosphere upon its reflections. Soon after\r\nour acquisition, we fancied a slight shadow or nebulosity appearing\r\nin one end of the stone. We carefully watched it, and before long an\r\nindistinct cloudiness began to appear, like the dim and distant haze\r\nof a summer sky on the commencement of a storm. Even then we thought\r\nit might be mere fancy on our part. But when the shadow changed\r\nto opacity, and the transparency of the gem, with its beautiful\r\nreflections, vanished, never to return, we were compelled to admit that\r\neven substances of the mineral kingdom had their diseases as well as\r\nforms of the organic world.\r\n\r\nThis is indeed but one example to illustrate a theory; but most of\r\nthose we purchased at that time of the Spaniards have altered in\r\nappearance, and some of them quite as seriously. Therefore we have\r\narrived at the conclusion that recently mined opals should be bought\r\nwith caution; and that the perfection of a rough opal as a gem cannot\r\nbe safely estimated until after it has been cut by the lapidary.\r\n\r\nNo definite idea can be given in relation to the price of the opal,\r\nso much depends upon the degree of its brilliancy and play of colors.\r\nThe gem is not sold by weight, but its value is estimated by its size\r\nand the perfection of its charms. An opal half an inch in diameter\r\nexhibiting fair colors may be worth $5, and another of the same size,\r\nof greater perfection, may bring $5,000, or more. The palmy days of the\r\nopal were during the period of Roman luxury, as the beauties of the\r\ndiamond were not then fully revealed, and the opal flashed forth its\r\nmarvellous beams of color both by daylight and artificial light. The\r\ngem then commanded enormous prices. According to the tables of Dureau\r\nde la Malle, the opal of Nonius was valued at twenty million sesterces,\r\nor about eight hundred thousand dollars. Enormous as this sum of money\r\nappears, Catherine of Russia would have given as much for the gem, if\r\nits beauty had been in keeping with its reputation.\r\n\r\nThe commerce of the opal affords a curious example of credulity and\r\nsuperstition, which is in singular contrast with the progressive ideas\r\nof our advanced civilization. In times past the changes that sometimes\r\noccur in the opal from physical causes have impressed the minds of\r\nsome excessively superstitious people as due to supernatural causes.\r\nAnd from these trivial fancies the most beautiful and _recherché_ of\r\nall that Nature has offered to us in the mineral kingdom has been\r\nplaced under ban. This superstitious dread may be of ancient origin,\r\nand whence its source we know not. But it is a matter of history that\r\nthe opal was the favorite gem among the Romans in their best periods\r\nof intelligence and refinement. So far from being feared at that time,\r\nit was eagerly sought for, as it was supposed to possess the power\r\nof warning against disaster, and exhibiting the rosy herald of joy.\r\nHence it has been thought that a feeling of superstition as well as of\r\navarice influenced Nonius when his paragon was demanded of him.\r\n\r\nIt is possible that the dread of the opal may be derived from the\r\nsuperstitious fancies that have descended to us from neolithic times,\r\nlike the superstitions connected with the ancient stone implements\r\nwhich are now called in Western Europe elf-stones. In Scotland at the\r\npresent day the ancient arrow-heads of stone are known as elf-bolts\r\nor fairy shots, and believed to protect the wearer from disease or\r\nmisfortune. Thus it appears that stone weapons of an extinct race\r\nare used as ridiculous charms by later nations far advanced in\r\ncivilization. History shows us how elves and fairies were created in\r\nthe popular imagination from neolithic sources, and how weapons and\r\nornaments of stone, amber, and metal became invested with mystic powers\r\nas objects of handicraft of the elves themselves. These objects are\r\nnot only regarded as fairy charms among the races of the East, but the\r\nbelief in their powers and use is quite as strong and tenacious among\r\nthe Celtic portions of Europe. In other countries these primitive\r\nideas of fairies and charms have become modified, and blossomed into\r\npoetic fancies to please chiefly the innocence of childhood. Some of\r\nthese the genius of Shakspeare and other poets have made beautiful,\r\nand to these we offer no objection. Poetic license may sometimes\r\ninvest an object with a positive effect which eventually may assume\r\nthe appearance of fact. Thus the allusion to changes in the beauty of\r\nthe opal in connection with misfortune, which was made by Sir Walter\r\nScott, in his novel “Anne of Geierstein,” was taken to heart seriously\r\nby many of his readers, and the gem was placed under ban. The popular\r\nimagination became so strongly affected that the commerce of the opal\r\nin England became very seriously injured; and even at the present\r\nday many a timid maiden hesitates over the selection of the opal for\r\nornamentation. Every mineralogist and man of science will rejoice to\r\nlearn that Queen Victoria exhibits sterling good sense in selecting the\r\nopal among her choicest family gifts, thereby presenting a pleasing\r\ncontrast to the superstitious and foolish fancies of the Empress\r\nEugénie.\r\n\r\nTo the amateur who loves the rare and beautiful, with a feeling\r\nuntrammelled by any of the misty traditions of the past or the caprices\r\nof fashion of the present, the opal is the dearest of all the gems. For\r\nit is not only rare, but it displays the glories of all the other gems;\r\nand it is the only one that defies the skill of the modern artisan to\r\nimitate. Its flash instantly betrays its character, and places it above\r\nsuspicion, while quite all of the precious stones regarded as gems are\r\nnow imitated so perfectly as to require close and careful inspection,\r\nand sometimes the application of scientific tests.\r\n\r\nWhen we recall the phenomena of the opal, and the wonders of its\r\nreflections, with their strange and sudden disappearance, we may pardon\r\nthe credulity of the Arabian romance writers in ascribing to the gem\r\nsupernatural powers. It was a beautiful theory with them that it falls\r\nfrom heaven in the lightning’s flash, and is the veritable Ceraunia.\r\nIts charming and mysterious play of colors suggested to their ardent\r\nimaginations the glories of Paradise, and hence they invested it with\r\nwonderful talismanic properties, and believed it to be the abode of\r\nafreets and genii. Alas for romance! Science clearly demonstrates that\r\nmany of the phenomena which puzzle the superstitious are simply due to\r\natmospheric influences and to the natural laws which regulate the decay\r\nof organic and inorganic forms.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             THE SAPPHIRE.\r\n\r\n\r\n  “The azure light of sapphire stone\r\n  Resembles that celestial throne,\r\n  A symbol of each simple heart\r\n  That grasps in hope the better part,\r\n  Whose life each holy deed combines,\r\n  And in the light of virtue shines.”\r\n\r\n  MARBODEUS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             THE SAPPHIRE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe colored varieties of sapphire were probably known to primitive\r\nman, and were gathered in their rough state to serve as rude ornaments\r\nlong before the diamond, with its less attractive natural appearance,\r\nwas recognized as a treasure or a gem. The mountain torrents, laying\r\nbare the superficial strata of the gem beds, early exposed to view\r\nthe sapphires of bright and attractive colors, which readily caught\r\nthe close, observing eye of the savage; while the diamond, lustreless\r\nwithin its apparent crust, was unnoticed and unknown until civilization\r\nbecame far advanced and revealed the hidden splendors of the gem by the\r\napplication of art.\r\n\r\nWe may therefore infer with a reasonable degree of probability that the\r\ncolored sapphires, though perhaps not the most ancient in mineralogy,\r\nwere in reality among the earliest gems known to man. The researches\r\nof the antiquary and the archæologist rather strengthen this view, for\r\nspecimens of these stones are found among the ruins of the ancient and\r\nlong-forgotten cities of Arabia and Persia, while the diamond is not.\r\n\r\nThis beautiful mineral has been known in the land of its birth from\r\ntime immemorial as “korund;” and under this harsh name were included\r\nall those beautiful gems known to commerce as the Oriental ruby, topaz,\r\nemerald, and sapphire. The ancients in the days of Pliny bestowed upon\r\nthe blue variety the more euphonious name of “hyacinthus.” Modern\r\nnomenclature, however, has adopted the term “sapphire” for all the\r\ntransparent forms of the mineral, reserving the name “corundum” for the\r\nopaque and translucent or non-crystallized varieties.\r\n\r\nIn making use of this word, we have another illustration of the strange\r\nadoption of a term which is destitute of any relationship to the\r\ncharacters of the object it is intended to describe. The “sapphirus” of\r\nthe ancients referred to lapis-lazuli, a blue opaque mineral spotted\r\nwith minute metallic flakes; and the only significance it bears in\r\nconnection with any of the forms of corundum is the simple fact that\r\nit means azure. If we follow the antiquaries still farther into the\r\nmists of early language, in seeking the etymology of the name, we\r\nshall probably find even less satisfaction. The nature of this gem, as\r\nwell as most of the other precious stones, was mere conjecture to the\r\nancients, and they formed their estimate of them chiefly from their\r\nhardness and color.\r\n\r\nAmong the early Greeks, Theophrastus strove in vain to discover some\r\nsatisfactory basis of arrangement for these minerals, and to explain\r\ntheir forms, their constituents, and the manner of their creation. But\r\nhis efforts and those of his contemporaries were of little avail; and\r\nso Ictinus, when he constructed the marvellous façade of the Parthenon,\r\nand Phidias, while he adorned it with immortal statues of marble and\r\nother stones, were alike ignorant of the nature of the materials\r\nthey employed in their work. Several centuries later the treatises\r\nof the Latin philosopher Pliny show that science had made but little\r\nprogress in this respect. The people of India and of the valley of the\r\nEuphrates, however, undoubtedly studied at a very early period the\r\ninternal structure of the precious stones, and the revelations thus\r\nobtained had some effect in shaping their religion and their views of\r\ncivilization.\r\n\r\nIn searching for the mysterious in the gems, the Assyrians discovered\r\nthe cuneiform crystals in the interior of transparent sapphires, and\r\nadopted the forms for their own use, believing them to be the language\r\nof the genii. We have little doubt but that the cuneiform character\r\nwhich now reveals the history of the extinct Oriental empires had\r\nits origin from the wonderful crystallizations sometimes seen in the\r\ninternal structure of the sapphire. These crystals are sometimes\r\nvisible to the naked eye; but when the polished surface of the mineral\r\nis exposed to a magnifying lens of even low power, they appear with\r\nstartling distinctness, and exhibit forms of perfect arrow-head shape\r\nof all colors. The field of vision may at first include but a single\r\narrow-head crystal of perfect symmetrical outline floating in the\r\nazure of the stone; but as the field is shifted myriads of crystals may\r\nsuddenly come into view, presenting a scene of such remarkable beauty\r\nand fascination that the observer ceases to wonder at the credulity of\r\nArabian superstition. These crystallizations may occur in sapphires\r\nof any hue, and then again we may search in vain for them in many\r\nother specimens of the same mineral. Some specimens may contain a very\r\nfew of these arrow-head forms, while others seem to be composed of\r\nmultitudes and masses of them. One large red sapphire of four karats\r\nweight submitted to our inspection appears to be composed of clouds\r\nof these cuneiform crystals; and under the magnifying power of about\r\ntwenty diameters it presents fields of arrow-heads flashing forth the\r\nmost brilliant hues, and changing into new scenes of startling and\r\ntranscendent beauty as the focus is varied. Whatever startled the\r\nimagination of the ancients with a new and mysterious beauty was at\r\nonce invested with supernatural power.\r\n\r\nIn connection with this theme it is interesting and instructive to\r\ntrace back the history of the gems and precious stones even within\r\nthe period of the past two hundred years, and read the descriptions\r\nand definitions bestowed upon them by mineralogists. Some of the most\r\ngifted of men, like Linnæus and Wallerius, labored diligently to place\r\nthem correctly in science; but their efforts to define and arrange them\r\nproperly seem at the present day like schoolboy fancies. Daubenton\r\nconceived the brilliant but erroneous idea of arranging them according\r\nto their color, taking the solar spectrum for a standard. His idea\r\nwas to place them in seven genera, according to the seven principal\r\nprismatic colors, and constitute species according to the different\r\nshades. This able man was not then aware that the sapphire and the\r\ntourmaline exhibit quite all of the colors of his seven genera.\r\n\r\nRomè de L’Isle was the first mineralogical writer who classed the gems\r\nsystematically; but it has since appeared that the amateur, Chevalier\r\nBaillou, preceded him in his crystallogical ideas; for in 1747 this\r\nobserver described, in the catalogue of his collection, his views in\r\nrelation to the properties of gems, and how their characters might be\r\nreadily ascertained by the tests of hardness and specific gravity,\r\nand also by the form of their crystallizations. The distinguished and\r\nlearned Abbé Haüy became interested and even fascinated with the study\r\nof the history and physical properties of the gems and the precious\r\nstones; and to his genius we are indebted for much of the information\r\nwe have at the present day on this subject. He was deeply interested\r\nin the nature and characteristics of the Oriental precious stones;\r\nand being dissatisfied with the harsh term and the vague synonomy of\r\n“korund,” as applied to some of them, he proposed the more elegant\r\nname, “telesie.” But science, often disdainful of new terms, finally\r\nadopted the name proposed by Wallerius; and at the present time all of\r\nthe fine and transparent varieties of corundum are called sapphire.\r\n\r\nThis remarkable mineral is found in mineralogical specimens in China,\r\nSiberia, America, and other parts of the world; but all of the fine\r\ngems, with perhaps few exceptions, come from Burmah, Pegu, Siam, lower\r\nBengal, and Ceylon.\r\n\r\nThe island of Ceylon is the most famous of all the localities thus\r\nfar known, and it is in reality the most wonderful gem deposit in the\r\nworld. It was known in the period of the Roman Empire, as the land of\r\nthe luminous carbuncle. This island, which is situated at the southeast\r\nextremity of the peninsula of Bengal, and separated from it by a broad\r\nbut shallow strait, is about as large as England in its area. In the\r\nsouthern centre of the island a group of lofty mountains appears,\r\nrising to the height of about 8,000 feet above the level of the sea.\r\nOn one side this great upheaval descends in successive ranges of hills\r\nuntil the flanks of the mountains subside into the alluvial plains;\r\nwhilst on the other side the mountain range is characterized by abrupt\r\nprecipices sometimes of several thousand feet in height. The great\r\ngem-producing districts of the island extend along the base of this\r\nmountain range for about fifty miles; and the central and richest part\r\nis considered to be located around Ratnapoora, which is scarcely two\r\nhundred feet above the level of the sea. This want of elevation in the\r\nCeylon gem strata or placers becomes a marked feature when considering\r\nthe high plateaux in which the diamond occurs in other parts of the\r\nworld, also coupled with the fact that the two gems are not found\r\ntogether in the same placers. Here are situated the celebrated mines\r\nwhich have yielded vast quantities of the sapphire, especially the\r\nblue variety, for an indefinite period of time. They are not small and\r\ntrivial deposits, but extend over large areas. Some of the plains which\r\ncover the deposits are more than thirty miles in extent, and form a\r\nlarge tract of country. Among them are the Kondapalle, Elk, Tolapella,\r\nHorton, Bopatalava, Moonstone, Newera Ellia, and many others.\r\n\r\nThe amount of labor expended in excavations on these plains is\r\nstupendous, and evidences still remain which indicate vast operations\r\nand remunerative labor in far distant times. The eastern portion of\r\nthe plain at Newera Ellia furnishes a good example of the extent of\r\nthe explorations. This region is still called the vale of rubies, and\r\nwas mined on a grand scale by the ancient kings of Kandy. Many acres\r\nof this plain have been completely upturned, and the surface is still\r\nindented with numberless pits of large size, varying from three to\r\nseventeen feet in depth. The period of these extensive operations is\r\nunknown, and is so far distant as to be beyond the mention of history\r\nor tradition.\r\n\r\nMost of the gem-bearing districts are classed as wild lands, and belong\r\nto the English Crown. As yet the authorities have never bestowed a\r\nthought upon their value as a source of revenue, and the search for\r\ngems is free to the world. Although much territory has been mined in a\r\nrude manner in past times, the fields are by no means exhausted, and\r\noffer excellent inducements to skilled labor. If some of the energy and\r\ndetermination now exhibited in the South Africa diamond mines could be\r\ntransported to Ceylon, the gem marts would soon display the splendors\r\nof ancient times.\r\n\r\nRatnapoora, which is the gem mart of Ceylon, and situated in the midst\r\nof the mines, means literally the city of rubies. The mines adjacent to\r\nit and in the district of Saffragan are the principal ones now worked\r\nin the island, but the gems are found under the western plains that\r\nextend from Adams Peak to the sea. The plains and valleys southeast of\r\nRatnapoora are all gem fields; and the beds of the torrents sometimes\r\ncontain so great a quantity of broken fragments of sapphire, garnet,\r\nzircon, etc., that the sifted sands are used by the lapidaries in\r\npolishing gems.\r\n\r\nThe mining operations are generally carried on by the native Cingalese,\r\nwho labor in the light of a pastime and only during intervals of their\r\nagricultural employments. Some few, however, undertake the labor as a\r\nregular business, but they belong to a low and dissipated class, and do\r\nnot work systematically or with regularity. Therefore, the gem-mining\r\nof Ceylon cannot be regarded as a fixed and permanent business.\r\n\r\nWhen an exploration has been determined upon, a small party of\r\nvillagers set out for the promising region provided with the implements\r\nof mining and the means of camping out. The times selected for the\r\noperations are after the heavy rains which prevail in June and October,\r\nand the floods have subsided. The beds of rivers or smaller streams\r\nare often chosen as easier of access than the plains. If the river-bed\r\nis selected, the first act of the explorers is to seek for the proper\r\nlocality where the gem-bearing strata may be found. To ascertain\r\nthis, the Cingalese thrust a long iron rod of ten or twelve feet in\r\nlength into the earth, and test the nature of the sub-soil. By means\r\nof long practice, the natives can adroitly penetrate the earth to a\r\nconsiderable depth, and, by the resistance to the movement of the rod,\r\ncan detect the gem deposit of which they are in search.\r\n\r\nIf the indications are good, the natives proceed to build a hut if they\r\nare at a distance from their village, and prepare for the operations,\r\nwhich often extend over many weeks. After diverting a part of the force\r\nof the stream so as to form a quiet pool, they proceed to excavate the\r\nsand and gravel within a certain area. In order to accomplish this they\r\nuse hoes with handles fifteen or more feet in length. The top strata\r\nare hurriedly raked up and thrown away; but as the pit deepens and the\r\ngem stratum is approached, the work is performed with greater care. As\r\nsoon as the hoes bring up fragments and bowlders of white quartz, or\r\nstrike a thin ferruginous crust, every particle of the gravel drawn\r\nup is carefully preserved. The gravel and sand thus obtained are then\r\nplaced in large baskets woven of split bamboo and shaped to a conical\r\npoint at the bottom. The basket thus filled is placed in the current of\r\nwater, and its contents washed by imparting to it a circular motion.\r\nThis washing process is kept up until the stones, gravel, and lesser\r\nparticles are cleansed. During this operation the gems, which are much\r\nheavier than common stones, settle at the bottom of the basket, and are\r\nthere collected together, so that when the superincumbent gravel is\r\nremoved, the sapphires, garnets, zircons, etc., are easily discovered\r\nat the bottom and removed. This is the manner in which the wet diggings\r\nare carried on, and is the easiest mode of exploration; but it is by no\r\nmeans as sure or often as profitable as the operations in dry ground\r\non the river banks or in the plains. The dry diggings are much more\r\nlaborious, as the soil is firmer and the gem strata must be transported\r\nto water to be washed and sifted. These dry deposits are found the\r\nrichest beneath the alluvial plains, which seem to have been in distant\r\ntimes shallow lakes and lagoons.\r\n\r\nThe gem stratum called mellan is always well defined, and occurs at\r\na certain depth, which seems to correspond to the bottom of the lake\r\nat a definite period. This depth varies from two to twenty feet, and\r\nis perhaps even greater; but the natives rarely excavate below the\r\ndepth of twenty feet. This peculiar formation, which is generally\r\nhorizontal, is composed of a conglomerate of quartz gravel resting upon\r\nor mixed with a stiff clay, often indurated by a ferruginous oxide. In\r\namong this cascalho, or just below it and adhering to it, are found\r\nthe fine pebbles and crystals of sapphire, tourmaline, garnet, zircon,\r\nspinel, and chrysoberyl. Under these rocks and in peculiar hollows in\r\nthe plastic clay, which the natives call elephants’ footsteps, the gems\r\nare found clustered together heterogeneously, and often so perfect in\r\nform as to appear as though created there. At other places they are\r\ncollected together in these pockets in such a manner as to suggest the\r\nidea that they had been washed in by a current of water.\r\n\r\nAll these varieties of gems, some of them widely differing from each\r\nother in composition and form of crystallization, are here embedded\r\ntogether, and seem to have one common origin. This is the true matrix,\r\nand the gems are not found in other portions of the soil unless some\r\ndisturbing force has removed them, like a strong current of water\r\nbreaking up the cascalho and transporting the gems to alluvions of its\r\nown deposit.\r\n\r\nIt is maintained and generally believed by mineralogists that the\r\nsapphire is formed in crystalline rocks; that in process of time the\r\nmatrix is disintegrated, the gems set free, and washed down to the\r\nalluvial soils where they are now found. It is also thought that the\r\ngem-seekers might with patient care trace the precious stones to their\r\nsource in the primitive ledges or the mountains, as the gold miner\r\noften follows for long distances the particles of gold in the soil\r\nuntil he discovers the parent vein in the solid ledge. But in Ceylon\r\nthis view is not entertained by the natives; and all scientific efforts\r\nto find the sapphires in the mountain ledges have utterly failed. All\r\ntrace of the sapphire and its attendant gems ceases as soon as we reach\r\nthe limit of the gem stratum, and what seems to have once formed the\r\nshore of the lagoon. Beyond this plainly marked outline we may search\r\nin vain for the least sign of a connection with the older rocks either\r\nadjoining or at a distance. The result is the same if we examine the\r\nledges on the same level or those of a higher elevation.\r\n\r\nIn some countries, in the granular limestone of New Jersey for\r\ninstance, or the ripidolite of North Carolina, the granite of Siberia,\r\nor the dolomites of Switzerland, we find sapphire, or more properly\r\ncorundum, of undecided colors, of inferior transparency or even of\r\nopacity; but it is very rare that a specimen is found of sufficient\r\npurity for ornamentation. The most transparent and perfect of these\r\nsapphires are generally impaired by cleavage planes which traverse the\r\nstone in several directions, preventing refraction of light, and often\r\nso marked as to appear like flaws. This circumstance indicates that the\r\nforces that deposited corundum and the fine sapphires were certainly\r\ndifferent in character, or that the conditions in which they were\r\nexerted were not the same. For in Burmah, Pegu, India, or Ceylon, and\r\nwherever the perfect sapphires are found, they have one common matrix,\r\nand that is the peculiar ferruginous conglomerate.\r\n\r\nThis conglomerate is recognized as a recent formation; and how came\r\nthese gems, which are believed to be as old as creation itself, to be\r\nfound among it? This formation is not only recent, but it is actually\r\ntaking place all over the world at the present day, and examples may\r\nbe found in almost every country. We find in many places the peculiar\r\nstrata of sand, gravel, and masses of stone in proper position to\r\nchange into conglomerate, which requires the action of water highly\r\ncharged with iron and lime or silica. Darwin found these stony layers\r\nin process of forming on the beaches of the Cape de Verde Islands,\r\nand in vain attempted to knock out a bolt of iron which had been cast\r\nashore from some wreck not long before, and had in a short space of\r\ntime become firmly fixed in the conglomerate. We may observe the same\r\nprocess taking place to-day on the coast of Cornwall, and among the\r\n_débris_ of the ledges of the Abrolhos Islands. In dredging rivers\r\nlarge masses of solid conglomerate are often brought to light.\r\nThe Thames has furnished many examples; and not many years ago a\r\ncannon-ball embedded in a crystalline calcareous rock was taken from\r\nthe bed of the Mediterranean not far from the mouth of the Rhone. Fresh\r\nwater laden with _débris_ of vegetable matter also possesses the same\r\ncementing action as sea water, and an excellent example is seen in the\r\nallios now forming in the Landes of southern France. This allios is\r\nalso a conglomerate, which has formed and is now forming at the depth\r\nof about three feet below the surface. Here the conglomerate of sand,\r\npebbles, and angular fragments of rock is firmly cemented together by\r\nthe rain-water, which filters down from the surface of the earth laden\r\nwith vegetable matter. The cascalho in which the diamond is found is of\r\nsimilar character, and has a similar origin, for we likewise find there\r\ntraces of vegetable _débris_, and the diamond itself contains germs of\r\nfungi and vegetable fibres of higher organizations.\r\n\r\nBut whence come the elements which form the gems? the inquirer will\r\nsay. Can we gather figs from thistles? Marco Polo in the thirteenth\r\ncentury visited these gem beds, and has left his views in the\r\nfollowing lines: “In ista insula nascuntur boni et nobiles rubini et\r\nnon nascuntur in aliquo loco plus. Et hic nascuntur safri et topazii,\r\namethisti et aliquæ aliæ petræ pretiosæ et rex istius insulæ habet\r\npulchriorem rubinum de mundo.” Buffon, four centuries later, in\r\nseeking for the causes of the formation of this mineral, observed the\r\npeculiarities of the matrix on this island, and boldly stated that\r\nthe origin of the precious stones like the rubies, the sapphires, and\r\ntopazes of the East is the same as that of the diamond. He also stoutly\r\nmaintained that these stones form and are found in the conglomerate\r\nin which is collected the _débris_ of other matters. The researches\r\nof Sir Samuel Baker and others on these deposits seem to indicate, if\r\nthey do not prove, that the sapphire in particular was formed in the\r\nsands, clay, or conglomerate where it is now found, and was not set\r\nfree by the disintegration of the old crystalline rocks. Nordenskiold\r\nrecognized these gem beds as true placers, but was inclined to think\r\nthe gem strata had decayed and left the gems free. An article published\r\nsome years ago in “Once a Week,” and supposed to have been from the pen\r\nof Sir Samuel Baker, who had lived many years at Ratnapoora, and had\r\nattentively examined the gem-bearing formations, gave the following\r\naccount:--\r\n\r\n “A common but erroneous belief is that the gems are formed in the\r\n mountains and washed down by the abrasion of the rocks and deposited\r\n in the alluvial bottoms. If it were so, they would have been traced\r\n to their source and sought for in the mountains, where they would\r\n naturally be found in greater quantities; but the natives never\r\n think of searching for precious stones in such places, and in the\r\n localities where they are found there does not appear to have been\r\n any local alteration in the veins of gravel since they were first\r\n thrown there; and my own conviction formed from observation on the\r\n spot, and for this and other reasons following, is that the sapphire\r\n and other gems have been formed and are still forming in the places\r\n where they are now found. In the first place, rounded sapphires and\r\n sapphire crystals with facets of brilliant lustre are found lying side\r\n by side. Secondly, both the rounded stones and the numerous perfect\r\n crystals, with their pyramids unbroken, show that they were never\r\n broken from other rocks, but were formed unattached to any matrix, in\r\n a soft medium such as fine sand or clay. I have seen hundreds of these\r\n taken loose from the same spot. Thirdly, crystals of sapphire are\r\n found with their edges reduced, yet with brilliant facets, which is\r\n inconsistent with their reduction by rolling. Fourthly, sapphire being\r\n much harder than any other stone with which it could come in contact,\r\n it is not easy to understand how any attrition could be brought to\r\n bear upon it to bring it to the beautifully translucent polish which\r\n the rounded stones usually bear more especially considering the short\r\n distance from the mountains to the alluvial bottoms between which the\r\n water-wearing process is supposed to be effected.\r\n\r\n “It is remarkable that the rounded sapphires and rubies are always\r\n the densest and of the finest water and color; showing that they were\r\n formed by different chemical forces from the others. In short, there\r\n is no more reason for supposing rounded sapphires to be water-worn\r\n than for supposing that the bowlders of jasper, for instance, on the\r\n Egyptian desert were so formed, when a fracture shows them to have\r\n been formed in concentric layers and to be in their original state.\r\n The same remarks apply to the crystals of some other minerals, as\r\n zircon, tourmaline, and spinel.”\r\n\r\nThe mineralogist, in contesting this opinion, will point to the round\r\npebbles of sapphire as evidence of disintegration and subsequent\r\naqueous action. But upon careful inquiry we shall find that these\r\nnodular masses are regular concretions and natural formations, which\r\ndo not owe their form to the abrasion of exterior force, but are the\r\nresults of crystalline action. We shall also find that these peculiar\r\nstones always form the finest specimens of the class of gems to\r\nwhich they belong, whether sapphire, diamond, tourmaline, topaz, or\r\nchrysoberyl.\r\n\r\nIn regard to beauty of color, density, hardness of texture, and\r\nbrilliancy, these apparently water-worn masses are decidedly superior\r\nto the perfectly shaped crystals, and among all the true gem mines of\r\nthe world this rule is observed. In the conglomerate of Ceylon we often\r\nfind gems whose appearance indicates the shock and abrasion of waves or\r\ncurrents of water, while we find in adjoining places perfectly formed\r\ncrystals whose facets display a lustre as brilliant as on the day of\r\ntheir creation. Some, then, have perhaps been moved about by aqueous\r\naction, while others have never stirred from their first position.\r\n\r\nAmong all the multitudes of sapphires taken from the mines of Ceylon,\r\nwe have never seen or heard of a specimen fairly attached to any rock\r\nas a matrix. Sometimes the ferruginous cement which is one of the\r\nnecessary components of the matrix unites accidentally the rough gem to\r\na mass of quartz, but all the sapphires we have seen exhibit no sign of\r\nhaving been attached permanently to any mineral substance. In fact, all\r\nthe rounded stones and the more perfect crystallized specimens have the\r\nappearance of having been formed in a soft medium like sand or clay.\r\n\r\nWhence come the masses of quartz that are always found in the\r\nconglomerate, and which sometimes occur of a large size? may be\r\nasked by the inquirer. This is a question which cannot be answered\r\nsatisfactorily, especially when the adjoining ledges do not contain the\r\nmaterial. We can, however, solve the problem by supposing that beds of\r\nquartz have been formed on the beds of the lagoons, and were afterwards\r\nbroken up by the action of the waves, frost, or other agencies.\r\nThe clay, which is often a component of this matrix, is sometimes\r\nargillaceous and at other times kaolin. We are generally inclined to\r\nbelieve that these substances are always the results of decomposition;\r\nyet there are abundant evidences to show that they may be original\r\ndeposits. The distinguished geologist Jameson was forced to admit this\r\nfrom his extended observations. We find blue, reddish, and yellowish\r\nmud in cavities of the hard crystalline rocks enveloping crystals of\r\nquartz and topaz, as at Greenwood, in Maine, or Schneckenstein, in\r\nGermany. The phenomena are well marked in the felspar quarries at\r\nBowdoinham, in Maine, and also at Schemnitz, in Hungary, in a vein four\r\nor five inches wide traversing porphyry. Whence comes this substance,\r\nwhen there is no opportunity for infiltration, if it is not an original\r\ndeposition? Perhaps by pseudomorphism.\r\n\r\nHow and why were these sapphires deposited in globular forms when the\r\nlaw of crystallization is so rigid and inflexible? This is a question\r\nwhich requires considerable assurance to answer, in the view that they\r\nare original depositions; but Nature offers many examples to sustain\r\nthe theory if we search her domain; for instance, how were the rounded\r\nnodules of flint formed in the chalk-beds? Their shape is not due to\r\nattrition, and their peculiar arrangement forbids the belief that they\r\nhave been rolled or abraded by the agency of water. In the interior of\r\nsolid ledges we find nodules of quartz with rounded edges, as though\r\nthey had been exposed to some dissolving agency or abrading force; yet\r\nthey have been beyond the reach of external violence. Hence we must\r\nconclude that their globular form is perhaps due to some deviation in\r\nthe usual process of deposition or crystallization. Huronite occurs in\r\nspherical masses in hornblendic bowlders; and we may find nodules of\r\ntourmaline in the interior of the most perfect crystals of the mineral.\r\nThere are other examples.\r\n\r\nThe Cingalese do the mining and sell the gems to Moors, who resort\r\nto Ratnapoora to attend the jewel fair, which is held at the annual\r\nBuddhist festival of the Pera. Purchasers not only from all parts of\r\nCeylon, but India, come to buy gems at this time. It has therefore\r\nbecome the great jewel mart of the world; and one can find there many\r\nof the rare and beautiful gems found in other parts of the world: the\r\nemeralds of Peru, the topazes of Brazil, the opals of Honduras, the\r\nturquoises of Persia, the jade of China; in fact, most of the gems\r\nthat have a commercial value, or any tradition attached thereto, are to\r\nbe found at these fairs. They are of greater importance than the famous\r\nfairs at Novgorod in Russia, to which the gems and precious stones of\r\nNorthern and Central Asia are annually sent.\r\n\r\nThe Hindoos are the best buyers of gems of all the nations of the\r\nworld. Their rajahs and princes pay the highest prices for the\r\nparagons; and the poor native had rather invest in a gem, which to\r\nhis simple belief adds to his security and happiness, than hoard\r\ngold coins, which are no better for concealment. The Moors are also\r\ngenerally the lapidaries. The tools which they use in cutting the gems\r\nare rude and primitive, and often the stones are much impaired under\r\ntheir hands; but some of the workmen are skilful and are able to copy\r\nwith exactness the most perfectly cut gems of the European lapidaries.\r\nWorkmen of the inferior class may be found in the little towns all over\r\nthe island; but the artists of the first rank are located at Callatura\r\nand Colombo. Immense numbers of garnets, zircons, and inferior\r\nsapphires, with other gems, are cut by these rude artisans, who place\r\nbut little value on their time, and therefore work for a trifle. These\r\nprecious stones are then sold on the island or exported to foreign\r\nlands, but are generally taken to India by travelling merchants, who\r\nexchange them for produce or money. The demand is so great from the\r\npopulous Mohammedan nations, that many of these gems are really higher\r\nin price in India than in the gem marts in Europe, as in the time of\r\nTavernier, three hundred years ago. Another potent reason prevents the\r\nmarket from being glutted: the Hindoo parts with his gem reluctantly,\r\nand only in case of necessity or in hope of greater gain; and the\r\nwealthy Parsee prides himself upon his display of gems, as well as\r\nupon his degree of caste. The quantity of gems treasured up by the\r\ninhabitants of India must be immense.\r\n\r\nThe composition of the sapphire, when found in the clear, transparent\r\nform, is pure alumina. Its degree of hardness is 9, being inferior only\r\nto the diamond; and its range of colors is very extensive, embracing\r\nmost of those seen in the solar spectrum. Its specific gravity varies\r\nfrom 3.9 to 4.3; and, with the exception of the zircon, it is the\r\nheaviest of all the gems. It is also compact and exceedingly tough in\r\nits texture, and resists the shocks and wear of time better than any\r\nother gem, not excepting even the diamond, which is harder, but far\r\nmore fragile. In point of brilliancy, it is below the zircon, garnet,\r\nand the spinel, its refractive index being 1.77 to 1.79. This mineral\r\npossesses remarkable electrical properties, but not so marked in degree\r\nas in the tourmaline or topaz; when this property is excited in the\r\npolished specimen, the attraction continues for a considerable length\r\nof time. The property of double refraction is not often very distinct,\r\nand by means of this peculiarity it is sometimes detected from the\r\nspinel.\r\n\r\nThe term corundum is now applied to the coarser and less transparent\r\nkinds of the stone, which have been used as a polishing material from\r\ntime immemorial. The granular variety known as emery is largely mixed\r\nwith iron ores, and is far inferior to the transparent and purer\r\nvarieties as an abrading agent. It is always of a blackish or dark-gray\r\nhue, and is often mistaken for iron ore. Asia Minor furnishes nearly\r\nall of the emery used in the arts. It is found there in masses or\r\nbowlders, either free or in granular limestone. In the United States it\r\nis found along the gold belt in the Southern States; and in Chester,\r\na town of Massachusetts, it occurs in a large and valuable vein\r\nassociated with diaspore, ripidolite, etc., which generally accompany\r\nit. At this mine at Chester, translucent sapphires of bi-pyramidal form\r\nare sometimes found. Dr. C. J. Jackson found one small blue crystal\r\nquite transparent and doubly terminated.\r\n\r\nThe corundum belt of the United States has been traced, with wide\r\nintervals, however, from Philadelphia to Northern Georgia. All along\r\nthis distance of several hundred miles, masses of corundum, more or\r\nless transparent, have been found during the past forty years, but\r\nactive search failed to reveal the mineral in its matrix. A few years\r\nago exploration in the extreme southwestern part of North Carolina\r\ndiscovered the long-looked-for corundum _in situ_. It was found on the\r\nside of a mountain, in a mica-like substance called ripidolite. The\r\ncorundum from this locality appears in geodes and also in well-marked\r\ncrystals, ranging from small size to even the weight of three hundred\r\npounds. It is often of perfect transparency, but may be translucent\r\nor opaque. The transparent crystals and masses, although possessing\r\nlimpidity, are traversed in all directions with cleavage planes, which\r\nprevent their use in ornamentation. The colors are also irregularly\r\ndistributed in patches, clouds, or in thin veneers; many specimens have\r\nbeen seen of variegated hues,--red, white, yellow, and blue,--and even\r\nthe whole of these colors have been seen in a single specimen.\r\n\r\nFrom the great number of specimens submitted to our examination we\r\nhave no hesitation in saying that gems cannot be quarried at will from\r\nthese mines. The inequality of color and the frequency of cleavage\r\nplanes will forbid. Small gems of few grains weight may be cut from\r\nsome of the transparent masses if the clear portions are selected with\r\ncare, and cut with that skill which is required in the shaping of gems\r\nwhose color is unequally distributed. But it is doubtful if fine gems\r\nare found in this formation, for the conditions which deposited the\r\ncorundum here, and the more perfect specimens in the true gem strata\r\nelsewhere, are quite different.\r\n\r\nThe colors of the North Carolina corundum are often very fine, and\r\nwe have seen specimens of a superb blue that retain their hues\r\nby candlelight. None of the reds we have ever seen have the true\r\npigeons’-blood tint, but are tinged with blue, and are therefore of a\r\nfiner shade when seen by artificial light than by daylight. The yellows\r\nare also of a decided shade, and generally form a portion only of the\r\ncrystal or mass of sapphire.\r\n\r\nSome fine crystals have been found here, but we have seen none so\r\nperfectly crystallized as the pyramidal specimens from the Asiatic\r\nmines. Several large crystals have been exhumed, one of which\r\nweighs three hundred pounds, and is well defined in its form of\r\ncrystallization. It is now preserved in the valuable cabinet of\r\nProfessor Shepherd, of Amherst College.\r\n\r\nA few years ago the gold-miners, while seeking for gold in the\r\nriver-beds and alluvial deposits among the mountains of Montana,\r\nobserved little transparent crystals of stone among the nuggets and\r\nflakes of gold, as they cleared out their rude apparatus used in\r\nwashing the auriferous soils. But little notice was taken of these\r\nlimpid stones, as their colors were generally faint; but the observing\r\ngold-seekers remarked their great weight and the remarkable coldness\r\nto the touch, as they passed them around to each other in wonderment.\r\nFor a long time the miners flung these minerals away with other refuse,\r\nunconscious of their character or their value; but one day there\r\nappeared in the dark sands of the gold-pans a stone which flashed forth\r\nsuch brilliant red gleams as to excite anew the curiosity and cupidity\r\nof the miners. This discovery led to inquiry, and the gold-seekers\r\nlearned too late concerning the value of the treasures they had\r\ncarelessly thrown away. Afterwards the gems were preserved and sent\r\nwith the gold-dust to the States. They proved to be sapphires. Some\r\nof them were finely crystallized in long, regular prisms, but the\r\nmost of them were without definite form. None of the several hundred\r\nspecimens that have been submitted to us exhibited smooth faces, like\r\nthe brilliant facets of crystals found in cavities of the crystalline\r\nrocks or in the gem mines of Ceylon; but all exhibited a roughness of\r\nthe exterior, as though they had been abraded by aqueous action.\r\n\r\nThe colors of these sapphires are generally faded or faint; some are\r\nsnow-white, but the most of them are of a faint bluish or greenish\r\ncast. We have, however, seen small gems of fine red, yellow, hyacinth,\r\nlight-blue, and celadine green. We have also information of a beautiful\r\nred sapphire of six karats, but failed to trace it after it was sent\r\nfrom Montana.\r\n\r\nThis discovery establishes the fact beyond a doubt that the gem occurs\r\nin quite perfect form in the territories of the United States. Most\r\nof the specimens we have seen were collected at El Dorado Bar, which\r\nhas since been abandoned by the gold-seekers. From this superficial\r\nsearch and incomplete information concerning the locality of the gem,\r\nwe are unable to determine whether regular gem mines are to be found in\r\nthis country, or along the slope of the mountains, which extend either\r\nnorth or south to a great distance. We have been assured, however, by\r\nofficers of the army, that fine sapphires have been brought to them\r\nby the Indians in Colorado living on the same range and formation\r\nthat stretches into Montana. Therefore we shall not be surprised if\r\nwell-directed search along this formation should reveal gem beds of\r\nvalue; and the mere circumstance that the gold-washers do not discover\r\nthem is of but little weight; for gem-seeking and gold-mining are two\r\ndifferent explorations.\r\n\r\nIt is a little singular that none of the beautiful gems occur in huge\r\nspecimens, like some of the products of the vegetable kingdom. Nature,\r\nhowever, in the mineral line, or certainly with the gems, creates\r\nher perfections in small bodies. We sometimes find a clear crystal\r\nof topaz, tourmaline, or emerald of a few ounces or even pounds in\r\nweight, but they are very rare; while the generality of all the choice\r\nspecimens are comparatively of a diminutive size. When occurring above\r\na certain weight they become defective either in color, limpidity,\r\nor form. They are precious stones, it is true, so far as composition\r\nis concerned, but they are not gems according to the acceptance of\r\nthe word. By the word gem we not only mean a precious stone, but its\r\ntransformation into a form possessing limpidity, brilliancy, attractive\r\ncolor, or some other charm.\r\n\r\nAs regards the sapphire, its perfect forms occur in diminutive\r\nsize. This mineral is also found in Bohemia, near Merowitz, in an\r\nargillaceous or marly cement, with garnets, zircons, and even fossil\r\nshells. Tavernier relates that he saw in possession of General\r\nWallenstein, when at Prague, some beautiful rubies, which were obtained\r\nin Bohemia. Fine stones of even five karats weight have been discovered\r\nat these mines. Concerning the mines of Lower Bengal we have but little\r\ninformation, and will not venture to give a description. We think they\r\nhave the same characteristics as those of the gem beds of Ceylon. The\r\nIlmenes Mountains, in Siberia, furnish sapphires of a strong blue. In\r\nGreece and Saxony they are also found in small quantities of undecided\r\ncolors, and generally opaque. Impure specimens of well-defined colors\r\nare found in the volcanic _débris_ of Expailly, in France, or among the\r\nsnow-white dolomites of St. Gothard; in the granite ledges close to\r\nthe base of the glacier of Bois, in the Alps of Savoy, we may observe\r\nregular prisms of sapphire, quite transparent and sometimes of a\r\ndecided blue or a tender green.\r\n\r\nThe massive and opaque varieties known as adamantine spar are said\r\nto be found in granitic rocks in China, and on the coast of Malabar;\r\nbut very little is known concerning the exact condition of these\r\nlocalities. Fibrolite and magnetic iron are said to accompany the\r\ncorundum in several of its localities. Brard believes that the blue\r\ndiamond of Pliny of the Island of Cyprus is no other than the blue\r\nsapphire. And this belief is not without foundation, as some of the\r\nvarieties of corundum are found on the islands and coasts not far\r\ndistant. Occasionally stones of fine blue tints and of considerable\r\nsize are found. In 1853, a large and beautiful piece was found in the\r\ngem strata near Ratnapoora, and sold to a Moor at Colombo for $20,000.\r\nFragments as large as goose eggs are also sometimes found in the\r\nSaffragan district, but are of an inferior character, according to Dr.\r\nDavy. Mawe describes one of three hundred and ten karats. We have in\r\nour collection a transparent, light-blue, and finely shaped crystal of\r\nthree hundred and eight karats, but we fear that it will not match the\r\ndistinct crystal of three inches in length which belonged to Sir Abram\r\nHume.\r\n\r\nThe suite of blues exhibited by this gem is very extensive, and\r\nembraces all known shades and even the purest prismatic hue. The deep\r\nregal blue is too intense a color for a night gem, as by artificial\r\nlight it becomes black. But there are sapphires of a celestial blue\r\npossessing perfect limpidity and rich velvety reflections that retain\r\ntheir splendid colors by night as well as by day, and they merit the\r\ndistinction bestowed upon them by the ancients when they consecrated\r\nthem to Jupiter. These superb gems are, however, exceedingly rare, and\r\nare eagerly sought for by amateurs at prices far above that of the\r\ncolorless diamond. The general color of the blue sapphire is a light\r\nshade, from which it passes through various gradations to a blue black.\r\nPerfect stones of fine colors are quite rare, for they are apt to be\r\nclouded, and the color distributed unevenly in the mass. Frequently\r\nthe color is in one extremity of the crystal, or appears as a spot on\r\nthe surface of a nodule. In other specimens it is arranged in bands or\r\nthin clouds. Hence much skill is often required to cut them so that the\r\ngem may display a proper distribution. Frequently the color is left in\r\nthe bottom of the gem, and when the stone is set the color is diffused\r\nby refraction through the upper portions, so as to give the gem the\r\nappearance of being colored throughout.\r\n\r\nOne of the most perfect and beautiful specimens of sapphire is the\r\nmagnificent blue gem now in the Natural History Museum of Paris. It\r\nwas given by M. Weiss in exchange for a collection of choice minerals.\r\nIt is of the form of an oblique angular parallelopipedon of 132¹⁄₁₆\r\nkarats. Haüy thought it had been cut and polished; but Satrin believed\r\nthat only its natural faces were polished, and that the form of the\r\nprimitive crystal was not altered. This is the most probable view,\r\nfor no lapidary of even ordinary skill would select the rhomboidal\r\nform for so beautiful and valuable a gem. This remarkable gem, without\r\ndefects, notwithstanding its great size, was found in Bengal by a poor\r\nwooden-spoon maker. It finally was acquired by Rospoli, of Rome, but\r\nwas purchased for the French Crown after several vicissitudes. It was\r\nobtained at the price of 170,000 francs, which price is certainly below\r\nits true value. France also possesses several other superb sapphires\r\nof large size. There is also in Dresden a fine sapphire, a gift from\r\nPeter the Great.\r\n\r\nThere was in the ancient Hungarian crown a fine large sapphire,\r\nsurrounded with four oblong green gems, the nature of which has not yet\r\nbeen made known. These mysterious green stones, rendered still more\r\ninteresting by the disappearance of the crown, are perhaps of modern\r\nintroduction, as they are not mentioned in the inventory of the jewel\r\nwhen Queen Elizabeth pledged it to the Emperor Frederick IV. Hence the\r\ninquiry arises, are they green sapphires, emeralds, tourmalines, or\r\nantique glass?\r\n\r\nIn the Universal Exhibition at London, in 1855, two immense and\r\nbeautiful sapphires were displayed among the collection of gems and\r\njewels which had been gathered from all parts of the world; they\r\nbelonged to Miss Burdett Coutts, and were valued at nearly $200,000.\r\nAt the same exhibition might have been seen a beautiful oval sapphire,\r\nand another in the form of a drop, and of very unusual size and beauty,\r\nbelonging to a rich Russian countess.\r\n\r\nThe Imperial Crown of the First Order of the Czar of Russia contains an\r\nenormous blue sapphire of great beauty and value. The Russian treasury\r\nalso possesses some others of great size and rare beauty. Among them\r\nis the famous light-blue stone which formerly belonged to the cabinet\r\nof the English banker, the late Mr. Hope. There is also a very large\r\nand celebrated sapphire, said to be of marvellous beauty in the Vienna\r\nKronenschatze. Most of the treasuries and regalias of Europe contain\r\nfine sapphires of value and beauty. Among the Crown jewels of France,\r\nthere are two superb gems of twenty-seven karats each, one of nineteen\r\nkarats, and about a dozen ranging in weight from nine to thirteen\r\nkarats each.\r\n\r\nThe Hindoos took great pleasure in carving images of their idols, and\r\nin making grotesque forms as well as talismans, from the precious\r\nstones found in their country; and very many examples are shown to the\r\ntraveller. The sapphire was often chosen for this purpose; and neither\r\nits excessive hardness nor its high price offered any serious obstacles\r\nto the determined votary or the superstitious grandee. There is a\r\nstatuette of Buddha, one inch in height, carved by the Hindoos out of\r\na perfect sapphire, in the British Museum, which came from the sack of\r\nIndia. One of the richest reliquaries of any age or any country is the\r\ngolden case at Kandy in Ceylon, which contains a tooth of Buddha, but\r\nwhich the naturalists declare to be the tooth of a monkey. Never was\r\nfancied sanctity so dearly enshrined. The dental specimen is enclosed\r\nin five golden cases fitting each other _en suite_ and incrusted with\r\nthe finest rubies, sapphires, and other gems Ceylon and India has\r\nafforded.\r\n\r\nPhilostratus describes a chamber in the ancient Royal Palace of the\r\nParthians at Babylon as follows: “It has a roof fashioned into a\r\nvault like the heaven, composed entirely of sapphires, which are the\r\nbluest of stones, and resemble the sky in color. This is the chamber\r\nin which the King delivers his judgment.” The Asiatics, in all periods\r\nof their semi-civilized history, made a lavish use of this gem in the\r\ndecorations of their dwellings and their temples. Even the partial\r\nruins of some of these edifices still to be seen in various parts of\r\nIndia, exhibit great beauty in their impaired mosaics of precious\r\nstones.\r\n\r\nThe red sapphire is known in commerce as the Oriental ruby, and when in\r\nperfection is the most magnificent of gems, and is rarely approached in\r\nthe beauty of its gorgeous hue by any other gem. The term ruby is an\r\nindefinite one, and refers to any stone of a rich red color. All these\r\ngems were classed together in the time of Pliny, under the generic name\r\nof “carbunculus,” but the red sapphire was reckoned a variety, and\r\nespecially referred to under the name of “lychnis.” It is seldom found\r\nexceeding three karats in weight, and the distinguished mineralogist,\r\nBeudant, declares that a perfect red sapphire of thirty troy grains\r\nis unknown, and would be of inestimable value. It is a singular fact\r\nthat while the blue variety should occur in masses and crystals of even\r\nseveral ounces in weight, the red is rare even at four karats. Modern\r\nmineralogists now maintain that all of the large historic rubies are\r\nspinels, but it is within the bounds of possibility that large red\r\nsapphires do occur sometimes as exceptions to an apparently rigid rule;\r\nfor we have lately received from the Ceylon mines a transparent crystal\r\nof pink color which weighs two hundred and forty-one karats. It is\r\nalso stated that the King of Arrakan possesses two magnificent prisms\r\nof one and a half inches in length and an inch in diameter.\r\n\r\nBut of all the fine red sapphires which are known and proved, there\r\nare but few above five karats. The largest one of which we have\r\nany definite knowledge is the beautiful gem set in the Toison d’Or\r\nof the French Regalia, and which weighs 8³⁄₁₆ karats (= 26 grains\r\ntroy). The inventory of the French gems in 1791 justly illustrates\r\nthe comparative rarity and diminutive size of the stone; for in this\r\nsplendid collection, which had accumulated during a long period of\r\ntime, and was then the richest in Europe, there were but four red\r\nsapphires above five karats, and only five above four karats. This\r\nvariety is singularly liable to imperfections, and far more so than\r\neither the blue or the yellow. It is rare to find a ruby of the pure\r\nand characteristic pigeons’-blood tint that does not in some degree\r\nexhibit silky and opalescent fibres. This defect, which generally\r\nappears as a milkiness in the interior of the gem, is due to minute\r\ncrystals dispersed throughout the stone, and which become apparent when\r\nthe mineral is viewed parallel to the primitive axis of the crystal.\r\nHence, in cutting the rough stone, considerable care must be exercised\r\nby the lapidary, so as to shape the gem and render its opalescence\r\ninvisible. Rubies of exquisite color are often rendered comparatively\r\nvalueless on account of fibres, clouds, and chalcedony-like bands.\r\nAll the red sapphires, however, are not affected in this way. The\r\nblood-red are much more liable than those which have a tinge of\r\nblue. We have examined a number of red sapphires perceptibly tinted\r\nwith violet, which were completely free from internal defects. This\r\nopalescence is never possessed by the spinel, and is therefore one of\r\nthe distinguishing marks in testing the nature of the red gems. The red\r\ntourmaline is also strangely liable to internal fibres, hollow threads,\r\nclouds, and longitudinal streaks, and sometimes presents an appearance\r\nsimilar to that of the ruby. The red sapphire is also distinguished\r\nfrom the other varieties by being decidedly heavier, and also by being\r\nsofter than the deep-blue.\r\n\r\nCeylon is famous for the abundance of blue sapphires, while the red\r\nvariety is comparatively rare. In Burmah, however, the red variety is\r\nthe most abundant and of the finest hue. The Ceylon rubies are regarded\r\nas inferior in tint to those found in Ava and Pegu of the Burmese\r\nEmpire; but they are less inclined to be opalescent, and are therefore\r\nmore brilliant. The violet tinge of the Ceylon rubies lessens their\r\nbeauty when viewed by daylight; but it disappears in a great measure\r\nby artificial light, and the hue then becomes of a fine prismatic red,\r\naccompanied by the most vivid lustre; therefore we may say in general\r\nterms that the Burmese rubies are the most beautiful by daylight, and\r\nthat the Ceylonese are superior by night.\r\n\r\nThe finest mines of rubies in the world are near the Capelan Mountains\r\nin Ava. But concerning their extent, history, and exploration, very\r\nlittle is known. Colonel Symes, who visited the country in 1795, with\r\nthe British Embassy, stated that the richest and most valuable of the\r\nmines were then situated in the vicinity of the capital; but that there\r\nwere many other mines in various parts of the kingdom. The information\r\nconcerning these remarkable deposits is vague and uncertain even at\r\nthe present day; but sufficient is known to establish the fact that\r\nthe geological formation is very similar to the gem beds of Ceylon and\r\nLower Bengal. According to the publications of the Asiatic Society of\r\nBengal, the principal mines of Burmah are situated about seventy miles\r\neast of the capital; and the deposits are discovered by sinking pits\r\nat various depths in the earth until the gem stratum is reached. It\r\nappears to be precisely like the conglomerate of Ceylon, and occurs at\r\na depth varying from two to forty feet below the surface.\r\n\r\nIt is stated that all of the fine gems above a certain weight are\r\nmonopolized by the king, who styles himself “Lord of the rubies,” and\r\nconsequently but very few find their way to the marts of other nations.\r\nIt is also stated that the gems are polished at Amarapoora, where there\r\nare about twenty lapidary establishments; and that pulverized blue\r\nsapphire, or the massive corundum spar, which is a trifle harder than\r\nthe red variety, is used as the abrading material. All of the mines\r\nare jealously guarded from the visits of Europeans; and when Professor\r\nOldham was allowed to examine some of them in 1855, he could learn of\r\nbut one European who had previously seen them. This favored person\r\nwas a deserter from the British army, and was employed by the king as\r\nsuperintendent of the mines.\r\n\r\nThis gem is so highly prized in Burmah that when a fine gem is\r\ndiscovered a procession is formed of grandees, elephants, and soldiers,\r\nand sent out to meet it and escort it to the royal treasury. The\r\nlong and exclusive possession of these mines has enriched the Crown\r\nimmensely; but nothing is known with certainty. Colonel Symes,\r\nhowever, saw some of the state carriages of the King of Ava, which\r\nwere splendidly decorated with jewels. One of these carriages was a\r\nmagnificent and singular production of art. Its decorations were so\r\nprofuse and contained so many precious stones set in silver and gold,\r\nthat it presented one entire blaze of the most brilliant colors. A\r\nvast variety of gems were used in the construction of this truly\r\nOriental vehicle; and among them were to be seen diamonds, rubies,\r\nwhite and blue sapphires, emeralds, amethysts, garnets, topazes, and\r\ncrystals of all kinds. Another of these queer barbaric monuments of\r\nart was lately exhibited at Rangoon. It is known as the Royal Hitee.\r\nThis grotesque piece of architecture, with fantastic name, is a light\r\nedifice thirty-five feet high, formed of seven terraces, surmounted\r\nby an umbrella, which is the emblem of royalty. The terraces were\r\nrichly inlaid with gold and precious stones; and the sacred umbrella\r\nwas profusely decorated with valuable rubies, pearls, diamonds, and\r\nemeralds.\r\n\r\nRambusson has recently stated that none of the mines yielding rubies\r\nhave been worked for one hundred and fifty years; and that all of the\r\ngems now offered in commerce have been collected previously. We think\r\nthis author is somewhat mistaken in this statement; for we know that\r\nthe Ceylon gem-deposit yields more of these gems at the present time\r\nthan for a long time past; and we do not quite believe that search\r\nfor them has been entirely suspended in Siam or in Burmah. During the\r\nlast years of the occupation of Ceylon by the Dutch, they exacted\r\nfrom the tribes of the interior of the island an annual tribute in\r\nthe form of a certain quantity of precious stones. Hence the King of\r\nKandy forbade further exploration for gems by the natives; and so the\r\ngem-fields lay neglected for a long time. Lately, however, under the\r\nEnglish rule, the ancient fondness for gem-mining has revived among the\r\nCingalese, and some fine gems have been discovered. In 1875 a native\r\nhunter found in a remote district of Siam some remarkable mines of red\r\nand blue sapphires; and explorations brought to light many valuable\r\nstones, which found their way to the gem marts of Rangoon and Calcutta.\r\nSplendid specimens were shown to Admiral Coote; and the consul at\r\nBangkok saw a magnificent stone of three hundred and seventy karats,\r\nwhich yielded a blue gem of one hundred and eleven karats weight, and\r\nof the finest water.\r\n\r\nRubies are even now scarce in India, and probably always will be,\r\nsince the demand for them is very great among the wealthy of the\r\npopulous nations of that country. Even three centuries ago Tavernier\r\nfound it profitable to buy them in Europe and sell them again in the\r\ncountry whence they had been taken perhaps many centuries before. Red\r\nsapphires not only exhibit singular internal structures, but they may\r\nbe colored strangely, thus puzzling the experimentalist to account\r\nfor the distribution of coloring matter. Davila possessed a fine and\r\nrare ruby which exhibited a clear white band between two parts of red.\r\nAnother gem showing a strange arrangement of color was to be seen in\r\nthe cabinet of Chantilly. It was half red and half yellow. Stones of\r\nsuch distribution of color are marvels of rarity; but it is quite\r\ncommon to meet with them partly red and blue or white, or blue and\r\nyellow. They sometimes display a vague dichroism which is not so well\r\ndefined as in the iolite or tourmaline. The naturalist Fanjas found\r\nat Expailly, in France, a transparent sapphire which, viewed in one\r\ndirection, exhibited a green hue approaching the emerald in its beauty\r\nof tint, but when seen in another light it appeared of a very beautiful\r\nblue. In the Orleans collection there was a curious sapphire which had\r\nbeen engraved with the figure of a woman, the head being formed of\r\nwhite, and the dress of intense blue. It is related that M. Bossi, of\r\nMilan, who was an excellent connoisseur in gems, saw in possession of\r\nPrince Metsch a superb sapphire which appeared to be dotted with flakes\r\nof gold. We sometimes notice this singular appearance in the interior\r\nof other gems, and find by the use of the microscope that it is due\r\nto internal flaws or reflections from plate-like crystals within the\r\nstone. We are inclined to believe that this gem of Prince Metsch is\r\nto be classed with the sapphire owned by Abbé Pullini, which had been\r\nengraved upon by the ancients. This stone, when viewed in a certain\r\ndirection, exhibited flakes of gold in the interior, which disappeared\r\nwhen the view was changed, which would hardly have been the case if the\r\nreflections had been produced by opaque bodies. We have before us a\r\npolished Siberian beryl which shows flakes of silver-white in certain\r\nlights, but which appear of dark-brown when the axis of vision is\r\nchanged.\r\n\r\nThe Crown of England possesses some large and beautiful colored rubies,\r\nbut they are probably spinels. The large one standing in the centre of\r\nthe Maltese cross on top of the British crown is probably a spinel,\r\nbut nevertheless of great beauty. It is also a gem of considerable\r\nhistoric interest, if we can believe the traditions that cluster around\r\nit, and it is believed to be the identical stone given to the famous\r\nBlack Prince of England, by King Pedro of Castile, after the battle of\r\nNajara. Tradition also asserts that King Henry V. of England wore it\r\nin the front of his helmet, in the bloody battle of Agincourt, about\r\na hundred years later. Its earlier history seems to be lost. Perhaps\r\nthis is the identical ruby given in 1360 to Rudolph II. of Austria\r\nby the Queen Dowager of France. When Peter the Great visited England\r\nhe gave one of the members of the royal family a very beautiful ruby\r\nwhich he carelessly took from his vest pocket. The last message sent\r\nby Mary, Queen of Scots, before execution to the Duke of Guise was\r\naccompanied with a beautiful ruby ring, as proof of the credibility of\r\nthe messenger.\r\n\r\nThe King of Burmah is said to possess an immense ruby of wonderful\r\nbeauty, of the size of a pigeon’s egg, but there is no authentic record\r\nof it. Tavernier mentions a ruby of 50 karats and another of 17¹⁄₂\r\nkarats, which he saw in possession of the King of Visapour; but as all\r\ngems of fine red color were then classed as rubies, we are ignorant\r\nof their nature. Among the numerous articles of loot obtained by the\r\nFrench in the sack of the Summer Palace at Pekin, was the necklace\r\nof the Emperor of China. This celestial jewel was formed of green\r\njade stones of delicate color, perforated and strung upon a cord, to\r\nthe centre of which was attached a monster red stone, of the nature\r\nof which we are not informed. It has been stated that the East India\r\nCompany has the largest specimen of red sapphire known, but we are\r\nunable to vouch for the statement. The largest ruby seen in India by\r\nGarcia was of twenty-four karats weight. Chardin, however, describes\r\na magnificent one among the crown jewels of Persia, in the year 1666.\r\nThis matchless gem was as large as a hen’s egg cut in half, and was of\r\nsuperb color. On its superior face the name of “Chaic Sophy” had been\r\nengraved by one of its former possessors.\r\n\r\nThe Crown of Russia possesses the finest and most valuable collection\r\nof rubies in the civilized world. Some of them are of enormous size and\r\nare probably spinels, but they are nevertheless of great beauty and\r\nvalue. The degree of color gives the true value to the gem, no matter\r\nwhat its composition may be, if its hardness is equal to quartz. Among\r\nthe red gems of lesser size there are undoubtedly red sapphires of\r\nvalue, but we have no positive details concerning them. In fact, all\r\nof the red stones of fine hues are classed as rubies without regard to\r\ntheir nature. The famous ruby placed under the cross in the Russian\r\ncrown of Anna Ivanovna is said to have been bought at Pekin by the\r\nRussian ambassador for 120,000 roubles. It is indeed a wonderful gem,\r\nand is one of the marvels of the mineral world, whether its material be\r\ncorundum, tourmaline, or spinel. It is now known that the Chinese have\r\nmines of rubies in the mountains of the Province of Yu-Nan, and it is\r\npossible that this gem may have come from that locality. The tourmaline\r\ndeposits of Nertschinsk, which yield gems of splendid red hues, are\r\nnot far distant from Pekin, and those mines may claim the honor of\r\nproducing this rare stone.\r\n\r\nThe throne of gold, called by the Persians Takdis, was supported on\r\nfeet formed of rubies. One of the seal rings of Chosroes II. was a\r\npink ruby, with the legend engraved upon it, “Riches are the source of\r\nprosperity.” The fifth seal ring was a red ruby, bearing the legend,\r\n“Splendor and prosperity.”\r\n\r\nThe flowers, composed of the finest gems afforded by the mines of\r\nIndia, and placed by Shah Jehan on the tomb of his beautiful wife, in\r\nthat wonderful mausoleum, the Taj Mahal, were the most precious ever\r\nmade. The roses of these garlands were made of the finest rubies; and\r\nthe leaves were composed of emeralds, which were made to glisten with\r\ndiamond spray. The screen which was built around the tomb was carved\r\nfrom marble, and as delicately wrought as a veil of lace; and along its\r\nborders, lilies, tulips, roses, and other beautiful flowers, composed\r\nof precious stones, were inlaid in the marble.\r\n\r\nThe tomb of Mahomet, at Medina, must contain some superb gems and\r\nworks of the goldsmith’s art. Here is to be seen that masterpiece of\r\nembroidery, the veil of Kunderas, which is composed of inwrought pearls\r\nand various precious stones of the value of ten millions of rupees. The\r\nfaithful relate, that when the rays of the morning sun glance over it,\r\nits wonderful beauty seems enhanced by invisible influences. The famous\r\nsympathetic ruby of the sacred Kaaba, now preserved in the temple at\r\nMecca, and believed to have fallen from the heavens at the beginning\r\nof the world, is undoubtedly an aerolite. The fiery red hue which it\r\nexhibited when traversing the sky, coming from unknown space, gave rise\r\nto the tradition of its being a latent ruby whose gleams of beauty had\r\nbeen temporarily suspended.\r\n\r\nThe yellow variety of sapphire is quite common, and exhibits many of\r\nthe finest shades of yellow; but they are generally very faint in\r\ntint and often like the lemon in hue. They are exceedingly liable\r\nto imperfections, and especially to that opalescence which so often\r\ndisfigures the red sapphire. Fine specimens, therefore, possessing\r\ntransparency and beauty of color, are rare gems. But when it does occur\r\nin perfection, it forms a magnificent gem, which is only surpassed by\r\nthe yellow diamond and zircon. Its rich golden hues, with soft and\r\nsatin-like flashes, are far superior to the Brazilian topaz.\r\n\r\nThe Museum of Natural History in Paris possesses one of the finest\r\nyellow sapphires known. It is a wonderfully lustrous gem of fine color,\r\nand measures nearly an inch in length by half an inch in breadth. There\r\nis also in the same cabinet a strange gem which was once placed among\r\nthe crown jewels of France. It was mentioned in the famous inventory\r\nof 1791, as a singular corundum of 19²⁄₁₆ karats weight, and of 6,000\r\nfrancs value. It had been polished in the form of an elongated oval,\r\nand exhibited the remarkable appearance of being deep-blue at the\r\nextremities and yellow in the centre. This singular distribution of\r\ncolor is not often seen in fine specimens, although it is frequently\r\nmet with among the inferior. We have also had the pleasure of examining\r\nanother large gem, cut into the form of a brilliant, whose diagonal\r\ncorners were blue and yellow, and yet, such was its play of dichroism,\r\nthat light reflected through these two colors produced but a faint\r\ntinge of green.\r\n\r\nThis double arrangement of coloring is sometimes seen with blue and\r\nred sapphires, or yellow, blue, and white; but we have learned of but\r\none fine gem displaying the red and yellow. Several of the transparent\r\ncrystals from North Carolina exhibit the two hues in the same crystal;\r\nand we have seen one that was actually red, yellow, white, and blue.\r\nBut the specimen was not sufficiently perfect to form a gem. Sometimes\r\nthe yellow hues are of a greenish cast, and then they resemble the\r\nfinest of the golden chrysoberyls, or they may approach the more\r\nverdant shade of the peridot. It is said by the antiquaries that none\r\nof the collections of ancient Greek and Roman engraved gems possess a\r\nsingle specimen in yellow sapphire. This singular absence may be partly\r\naccounted for by its rarity in perfection, and also from its liability\r\nto appear pale when set in gold.\r\n\r\nIn the French casket of gems, in the year 1791, mention was made of\r\na superb yellow sapphire of 27¹⁴⁄₁₆ karats, two of 13 karats each,\r\nand one of 11 karats, all of which were valued at 8,900 francs. The\r\nbeautiful specimen now exhibited in the Cabinet of Minerals, in the\r\nGarden of Plants at Paris, which is of the purest and richest color,\r\njoined with wonderful lustre, is supposed to be the gem mentioned above\r\namong the crown jewels. The French amateur and writer on gems, Caire,\r\nonce possessed a remarkable and charming yellow sapphire of the great\r\nweight of twenty-nine karats. Its former Hindoo owner had seriously\r\nimpaired its beauty by drilling a hole in one extremity for the purpose\r\nof suspension; and had also engraved on its sides inscriptions in\r\nArabic, which were probably condensed quotations from the Koran to\r\npreserve the possessor from harm.\r\n\r\nThe green variety is probably the rarest of all the forms of sapphire,\r\nand finely tinted stones are very seldom seen. They are generally of\r\na faint sea-green tinge, and resemble beryls in their hues. But when\r\nthey do occur of grass-green color, they form magnificent gems and far\r\nexceed the true emerald in lustre and brilliancy. We very much doubt,\r\nhowever, if they ever approach the emerald in its exquisite shade of\r\ngreen. We have examined many green stones from the Ceylon gem mines,\r\nand with one exception have found them to be green spinels, zircons,\r\nand tourmalines of various intensities of shade. The one undoubted\r\nspecimen referred to was of an impure hue. The celebrated Romè de\r\nL’Isle possessed two beautiful crystals of green sapphire. When they\r\ndisplay the sea-green hue or the mountain-blue of the beryl, they are\r\nthen called Oriental aqua-marines, but fine stones of this description\r\nare not common. We have seen some small but very beautifully tinted\r\ngems of this class from the gold fields of Montana. Barbot speaks\r\nwith ecstasy of two green sapphires from Matura in Ceylon, and which\r\nfar exceeded any other gem in their velvety color, limpidity, and\r\nbrilliancy. It is possible that these two gems may have been zircons,\r\nas these stones abound in Matura, and are of the most vivid lustre when\r\nperfect. But stones of fine green hues of this mineral are exceedingly\r\nrare. We have also seen a specimen of transparent corundum from Siam\r\nwhich was dichroite, blue and green one way, and entirely green the\r\nother. It called to mind that found at Expailly in France, by the\r\nnaturalist Fanjas, and which appeared of an almost emerald green when\r\nviewed in one direction, or of a most beautiful blue when the axis of\r\nvision was changed.\r\n\r\nThe name girasole is applied to those gems that exhibit a peculiar\r\nradiance when exposed to the sunbeams. This curious play of light is\r\nseen in the transparent and translucent stones, but especially in\r\nthe translucent. When the gem which possesses this quality is cut in\r\nthe boss form it shows a glimmering light brighter at one part than\r\nat another, owing to a peculiar internal refraction. The effect is\r\nvery beautiful when the gem is of fine color, and the bright spot\r\nmoves mysteriously over a more sombre ground as the stone is turned\r\nin various directions. The sapphire rarely shows this property to\r\nthe same perfection exhibited by one of the varieties of opal. We\r\nhave seen two specimens from the North Carolina corundum mines, which\r\nwould have been very superior gems if they had not been traversed in\r\nall directions by numerous cleavage planes. They were quite an inch\r\nin diameter, of a nodular form, and had been deposited in a ledge of\r\nripidolite.\r\n\r\nOne of the most remarkable varieties of the sapphire is known as the\r\nasteria, which was so named by Pliny from the fact of its displaying\r\ndiverging rays of light. This phenomenon is only seen in stones of\r\nsemi-opacity or inferior clearness, and the star-like rays are so\r\narranged as to be inclined to each other at an angle of 60 degrees.\r\nThese stones may be of various colors,--blue, red, or gray,--yet the\r\nrays of the star are always white or faintly tinged, and stream forth\r\nin beautiful contrast to a ground of delicate blue or decided red.\r\nThe stars appear the most distinctly to view when the polished gem is\r\nexposed to direct sunlight or a small bright flame. This mysterious\r\nplay is seen in but few of the gems, and the sapphire exhibits it\r\nin its greatest perfection. It is indeed a curious thing to see a\r\nsix-rayed star with long silken beams of light suddenly appear to view\r\nas the gem is turned to the light, and as quickly disappear as the\r\nfocus is changed. No wonder the ancients believed the appearance due\r\nto supernatural powers. The microscope, however, has disclosed to the\r\nmoderns the cause of the asterism. This instrument reveals multitudes\r\nof minute crystals within the stone, arranged in three different but\r\nequal angles. To obtain the stellate appearance in perfection, then,\r\nthe stone must be cut and polished in cabochon or dome-like form.\r\nThe apex of the gem is then in a direct plane to these angles, being\r\nperpendicular to the axis of the primitive form of the crystal, and\r\ntherefore the rays of light are reflected from the sides of these\r\nmultitudinous crystals producing the asterism.\r\n\r\nAs we have said before, some other minerals exhibit this phenomenon\r\nat times. We find it in rare specimens of quartz and in some of the\r\nmica group. In some rare fragments of quartz from Siberia the stellate\r\nappearance is seen in extraordinary perfection. The six-rayed star is\r\nnot only seen by refracted light, but is even visible by transmitted\r\nlight. Sometimes these stones also exhibit reflections of red and blue\r\nas the direction of the stone is changed, thus combining the girasole\r\nand asteria in the same gem. Lancon relates that M. Desmaret possessed\r\na little plate of this variety of quartz, of so great beauty and\r\nperfection as to refuse 25,000 francs for it. There is in the Museum\r\nof the Jardin des Plantes a remarkable diamond asteria; and there are\r\nalso in this collection and in the cabinet of the École des Mines some\r\nsuperb blue and red sapphire asterias.\r\n\r\nThe pure white sapphires are not often found. When well cut they\r\nexhibit a vivid eclat, and are sometimes mistaken for diamonds; but\r\nthey are easily detected by the expert, since they do not possess\r\neven three fourths of the degree of brilliancy of the diamond, nor\r\nthe prismatic play of color. Some of the faint-colored stones lose\r\ntheir tints when subjected to a high degree of heat, and improve in\r\nbrilliancy and lustre. It is said that the Orientals practise this\r\ntrick extensively, and sell the altered gems for diamonds. We are not\r\naware of the refractive index of these fire-tested stones having been\r\nmeasured with the view of ascertaining the degree of change; but it\r\nis certain that their lustre is increased in a marked degree. Heat,\r\nhowever, does not affect all colored sapphires. Some of the red are\r\noften changed to deeper hues, and others are not affected. Brogniart\r\nfound that the French sapphires from Expailly were actually rendered\r\nmore intense in color by the action of fire. After numerous experiments\r\nwith the faint-colored sapphires from Montana, we also have come to\r\nthe conclusion that the stones from this locality are not perceptibly\r\naffected by long-continued heat.\r\n\r\nSir David Brewster, in conducting his famous experiments in optics, was\r\nof the opinion that the white sapphire, on account of its structure and\r\nits refractive power, was superior to all other transparent minerals\r\nfor lenses for the microscope. The diamond, which one would naturally\r\nsuppose to be the most perfect material for the purpose, on account of\r\nits high refractive power and apparent clearness, is really faulty, and\r\ncomparatively worthless on account of its internal structure. If the\r\nwhite sapphire is of such excellence in this respect, on account of its\r\ncompactness and refractive power, why will not the white zircon prove\r\nfar superior as a lens, as it is the most compact, transparent, hard\r\nmineral known, and its refractive power is much greater than that of\r\nthe sapphire? Black sapphires are now and then mentioned by authors,\r\nbut we are inclined to believe that they are very rare; for Davy\r\ndeclares that he met with but two or three specimens in his travels\r\nin India or Ceylon. Blue stones of very deep hue appear sometimes\r\nquite black; but when they are placed in a strong light, and viewed in\r\nanother direction, the blue tinge clearly appears. The violet sapphire\r\nof perfect hue is a very rare gem, and may be regarded as an accidental\r\nstone, being formed of an admixture of the blue and the red. Davy,\r\nin all his extended researches in Ceylon, found but two specimens of\r\nviolet sapphire; and in our examinations of the rough gems from the\r\nmines, we are inclined to think the purple spinel is often supposed\r\nto be a purple sapphire. Romè de L’Isle found that this variety of\r\nsapphire is oftener ruby-violet than sapphire-violet, or that the red\r\ntinge prevailed more distinctly than the blue. The lilac-blue are\r\nexceedingly rare, and are eagerly sought for by amateurs.\r\n\r\nThere are some sapphires which exhibit a double play of colors when\r\nviewed by natural and then by artificial light. For instance, they may\r\ndisplay a decided blue color by day and an amethystine tint by night.\r\nD’Auguy possessed a stone that showed in the daylight a beautiful,\r\nclear, and sparkling blue, but by candlelight it changed to a royal\r\npurple. The cause of this phenomenon is perhaps due to an excess of\r\nlatent red in the stone, which, however, is not visible in the daytime;\r\nbut which is called forth by the difference in the illuminating lights,\r\nas is shown in their spectra. The hyacinth sapphire is seldom seen, and\r\nwhen perfect is regarded as among the marvels of the species. Dutens\r\npossessed a fine one which had been engraved upon by the Greeks.\r\n\r\nThe subject of the glyptic art, or engraving upon stones, is very\r\ninteresting to the student who seeks for evidences and traces of the\r\nsocial life of man in early ages. The engraved cylinders of Babylon\r\nand Nineveh, with their cuneiform legends, carry us back to traditions\r\ntwo thousand years before the Christian era; and from the engraved\r\nscarabei of Egypt and Etruria we form some ideas of the people whose\r\nhistory has otherwise been lost. We may, perhaps, consider the true era\r\nof the glyptic art as dating from the time of the Macedonian princes\r\nand the Persian conquests, although it had been practised in a rude way\r\nfrom far earlier times. This art of cutting figures upon bright and\r\nrichly colored, though minute stones, was quite as much admired among\r\nthe ancients as the laborious skill, with its powerful blows, which\r\nproduced the heroic statues out of bronze or marble. And perhaps we may\r\nsay that these gems, in their estimation, were of greater value, not\r\nonly on account of their beauty and rarity and their minuteness, but\r\nalso on account of their hardness, which defied the steel instruments\r\nof the ordinary sculptor, and yielded only to the dust and splinters of\r\nthe hardest minerals, like the sapphire and the diamond. We may also\r\nsafely affirm that the gem-engravers of the Alexandrian and Augustan\r\nages were, in all that concerns excellence of design and composition,\r\nrivals of the most famous workers in marble and bronze. These admirable\r\nand wonderful artists contrived to enclose within the narrow limit of a\r\nlittle stone all the complicated details of an event in history, or of\r\na fable in mythology; and to make them stand forth in beautiful relief\r\nas a cameo, or to sink them down as an intaglio, with all that truth of\r\ndesign and power of expression which characterize the excellence of the\r\nlargest works of the most consummate masters.\r\n\r\nBy means of these engraved gems, miniature but accurate copies of some\r\nof the celebrated masterpieces and noblest works of ancient sculptors\r\nhave been preserved to us, while the originals have been destroyed,\r\nand even the record of them lost. An instance may be observed in the\r\nengraved gem in the Orleans cabinet, which is the only representation\r\nwe now have of the famous statue of the Repose of Hercules, by\r\nLysippus. As a learned critic has said, in these gems we have the\r\nemanations, ever fresh and unfaded, of the feelings and the taste\r\nof those ages when the love of the beautiful was the all-prevailing\r\nand almost sole religion, and flourished unfettered by tradition,\r\nprejudice, and conventional rules; whilst from the universal demand\r\nduring those same ages for engraved gems, whether for signets or for\r\npersonal ornaments, artists of the highest ability did not disdain the\r\nnarrow field of the precious stone as the arena for the exercise of\r\ntheir power. The unparalleled vigor and perfection of many of these\r\nperformances are a sufficient proof that they proceeded directly from\r\nthe master’s hand, and were not mere slavish copies, by a mechanic,\r\nafter designs created by the genius of another. The lovers of the fine\r\narts may derive much benefit from the study of the antique in this\r\nparticular branch of workmanship. What is there more pleasant than the\r\ncontemplation of the work of the artists of antiquity; and to behold,\r\nshut up, as it were, within the narrow compass of a small gem, all the\r\nmajesty of a vast design and a most elaborate performance? During the\r\nflourishing periods of the Greeks countless statues were carved by\r\nnumerous artists; and it has been stated that Lysippus alone executed\r\nfifteen hundred, all perfect, and some of them colossal. Throughout\r\nAsia Minor, Greece, and Italy every town had its temple, gymnasium,\r\nor forum peopled with statues of those among her sons who had in any\r\nway distinguished themselves in arms, letters, or public games. These\r\nbecame the spoil of the later Romans, and an incredible number were\r\ntransported to Rome from time to time. Nero is said to have selected\r\nfrom Delphos alone five hundred bronze statues for transportation to\r\nRome. The Etruscan bronzes were quite as plentiful; and Flaccus is\r\nsaid to have carried away in triumph two thousand statues from the sack\r\nof Volsinii.\r\n\r\nFrom these statements in ancient history concerning the number of large\r\nworks in statuary, we can form some idea of the inexhaustible treasury\r\nof portraiture in another and oftentimes less costly material. It is\r\nestimated that for a period of three hundred years, the engraved gems\r\nwere manufactured in countless numbers all over the Roman world. It is\r\na little curious that licentious scenes and figures are never or rarely\r\nfound on antique gems.\r\n\r\nAmong the gems preserved in the museum of the Vatican may be seen two\r\nengraved intaglios of early date, upon sapphires of an amethystine\r\nhue. Among the most beautiful of the engraved sapphires that have been\r\npreserved to us from ancient times is that of Cneus, now placed in the\r\ncabinet of the Strozzi, in Italy, which represents the figure of young\r\nHercules. In the collection of gems at Turin there is a white sapphire,\r\non which a fine head of Tiberius has been engraved. There may be seen\r\namong the crown jewels of Russia a beautiful sapphire of two shades,\r\nengraved with a representation of a female figure enveloped in drapery.\r\nThe figure is engraved in the darker shade of the stone, while the\r\ndrapery is carved from the lighter part. The French cabinet boasts of\r\na very fine blue sapphire with an engraving representing the Emperor\r\nPertinax.\r\n\r\nKing, the excellent and tireless antiquary, mentions, in his chapter\r\non the hyacinthus, several beautiful and unique engraved sapphires. He\r\nstates that engraved gems of this class, dating to times previous to\r\nthe Imperial epoch, are extremely rare; still, there are extant some\r\nundoubted specimens, among which are a small Etruscan scarabeus and a\r\nmagnificent head of Jupiter, executed in the purest Greek style. The\r\naccidental discovery of the last indicates how many more of the fine\r\ngems of antiquity may yet appear in course of time to gladden the\r\nlovers of the glyptic art. This gem was an inch in diameter, and of\r\nfine color; but to utilize it to the wants of the Turkish possessor,\r\nwho wished to set it in the handle of his dagger, the engraved side\r\nwas set downward and thus preserved from injury, while the back of the\r\nstone was rudely faceted by some Eastern lapidary. A Medusa’s head of\r\nthe same style of execution, upon a stone of remarkable beauty, is\r\none of the chief glories of the celebrated Marlborough collection.\r\nIn the same museum there is another larger and deeper-hued sapphire\r\nbearing the head of Caracalla, the short, curly hair of the irascible\r\ntyrant being represented by a series of minute holes closely drilled\r\ntogether. One of the most famous of all engraved gems of this material\r\nis the signet ring of Constantius. The stone is one of great beauty and\r\nperfection, and weighs fifty-three karats. Its engraving represents the\r\nEmperor as spearing a monstrous wild boar before a reclining female\r\nfigure, personifying Cæsarea of Cappadocia, the scene of exploit.\r\nIt bears an inscription in proof of its royal use,--the letters\r\n“Constantivs Avg.” King mentions another fine specimen of the time of\r\nHadrian, representing “Hebe feeding the eagle.” It was heart-shaped in\r\nform, of fine color, and quite an inch and a half in diameter.\r\n\r\nThe museums of Europe contain many examples of mediæval and modern\r\nengraved sapphires, one of the finest of which is the famous portrait\r\nof Pope Paul III. among the Pulsky gems, and attributed to Il Greco.\r\nIt is a very beautiful stone, and three quarters of an inch square. In\r\nthe Marlborough cabinet there is an extraordinary specimen of a thumb\r\nring of high antiquity, cut from a single stone, but of rather a pale\r\ntint. Rings containing both plain and engraved sapphires have been the\r\nappointed symbol of church authority from a very early day. They have\r\noften been bestowed as the badge of pontifical rank, and the custom has\r\ndescended to the present day. King devotes an interesting chapter to\r\nthe history and description of this class of ornaments and symbols; and\r\nto his pages we must refer the interested reader.\r\n\r\nEngraved red sapphires of ancient date are extremely rare, so rare\r\nthat the experienced antiquaries, Lessing and Clarac, deny the\r\nexistence of any antique intaglios of this variety. Investigation\r\nhas proved that many of the supposed engraved rubies are really red\r\nspinel, garnet, or zircon. Nevertheless, there are a few examples to\r\nprove that the ancients did make use of the gem in the glyptic art,\r\nalthough the act was regarded as one of extreme extravagance, from\r\nthe rarity, costliness, and beauty of the material. The Devonshire\r\nparure exhibits a convex red sapphire of about three karats weight,\r\nof pure pigeons’-blood tint, and engraved with a Venus Victrix in the\r\nlatest Roman manner. Another shows a full-length figure of Osiris, in\r\nhalf-relief, of the time of Hadrian. In the museum of the Jardin des\r\nPlantes there are said to be two engraved red sapphires.\r\n\r\nThere are but few gems with which the blue sapphire can be confounded.\r\nThe blue diamond can be easily detected by its superior brilliancy and\r\nhardness. It is very rare that the tourmaline appears of a deep blue,\r\nand still more rare for the topaz to assume the appearance except of\r\nthe very light varieties, and the same may be said of the beryl. The\r\niolite, which, however, is a very rare mineral, may resemble the blue\r\nsapphire, but its inevitable dichroism betrays its character. Turn the\r\ngem before the eye, and the deception vanishes; the blue disappears as\r\nif by magic, and the stone is gray. Kyanite sometimes appears of the\r\nmost beautiful blue tints, but its softness indicates its nature, and\r\nprevents its use as a gem. The glass-workers, however, produce the most\r\nbeautiful and attractive imitations of sapphire, and of all colors,\r\nlacking but one desideratum, and that is the thus far unattainable\r\ndegree of hardness. The red, green, yellow, and white varieties may\r\nall of them be closely approached in color by other gems, and the best\r\nmethods of detection are the tests of specific gravity, degree of\r\nhardness, and the optical phenomena.\r\n\r\nThe blue variety of sapphire being less sought after in ornamentation\r\nthan the diamond, has not had a fixed scale in valuation. Still, prior,\r\nor for a few years prior, to 1850, the ordinary sapphire was placed\r\nby jewellers upon the same valuation as the emerald, or at about $15\r\nthe karat. Since this period its value has quadrupled, but has not\r\nkept pace with that of the emerald. The pale-blue stones have only a\r\nnominal value, and the same may be said of the very dark blue. But\r\nthose sapphires which exhibit the perfect tint of the prismatic blue\r\ncan command very high prices.\r\n\r\nThe ancient Romans excelled in their imitations of the ruby, both\r\nin hardness, color, and lustre; and a number of examples are yet\r\npreserved in some of the European cabinets. The bold robber, Charles,\r\nthe Duke of Burgundy, was the possessor of several famous gems which\r\nhe carried with him on his campaigns, and used as personal decorations\r\non particular occasions. One of the choicest of them was a monster\r\nruby more than an inch in diameter, which the famous Margaret of Anjou\r\nhad given him. On that fatal day at Grandson it was placed with the\r\nhistoric diamond in a golden box, and left in the tent of the Duke,\r\nwhere it was captured by the mountaineers. The gems were carried to\r\nBerne by the victorious Swiss, and afterwards offered for sale to the\r\nrich Nuremberger, Jacob Fugger. Then it was discovered by the expert\r\nthat the ruby was indeed a lump of red glass of ancient make, and\r\nprobably of the date of the Roman Empire.\r\n\r\nAs the red sapphire is one of the rarest as well as the most beautiful\r\nof all gems, its value is in keeping with its attributes. As it\r\noverpowers all other gems with its gorgeous red, which is a pure\r\nprismatic hue, so it transcends all others in price. There are but\r\nvery few gems with which it can be confounded in color. But no matter\r\nwhat the material may be, provided it displays the royal tint. It is\r\nextremely rare that the red tourmaline or spinel exhibit the perfect\r\ntint which is the characteristic of the red sapphire. The zircon\r\nsometimes displays a fine red color, and may imitate the sapphire. It\r\nis also within the range of possibilities that the diamond and garnet\r\nmay closely resemble the true ruby. We have seen small garnets that\r\nexhibited the pigeons’-blood tint. The scarcity of the ruby is so great\r\nthat fine gems are only to be acquired by the very wealthy. In the\r\ntimes of Cellini, three centuries ago, the price of the red sapphire\r\nwas eight times that of the diamond. And to-day we may safely adopt\r\nCellini’s estimate, for the gem is so rare that we cannot readily\r\ncompute its value in comparison with the diamond, which is so abundant.\r\n\r\nKing, in commenting upon the valuation of precious stones during the\r\npast three hundred years, mentions two fine rubies which were sold in\r\nLondon recently for enormous sums of money. One of three karats brought\r\n$1,500; while another of finer tint, of less than four karats (11\r\ngrains), was sold for $5,500, or for $500 a grain, which price is quite\r\nequal to Cellini’s estimate made in the year 1560.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX.\r\n\r\n\r\n  A.\r\n\r\n  Abbas Murza, 214.\r\n\r\n  Abbé Haüy, views of, 75, 91, 253, 371.\r\n\r\n  Abbey of St. Dennis, gems of, 236,
