The pebble I hold in my hand was picked\r\nup in the bed of the torrent which is dashing down the side of yonder\r\nhill, and winding its way through that beautiful valley, and over those\r\n\r\n  Huge rocks and mounds confus'dly hurl'd.\r\n  The fragments of an earlier world,\r\n\r\nwhich partially filling up the chasm, and obstructing the course of\r\nthe rushing waters, give rise to those gentle murmurings that are so\r\ninexpressibly soothing and delightful to the soul.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: ORIGIN OF THE PEBBLE.]\r\n\r\nUpon examining this stone I discover that it is but the fragment of a\r\nmuch larger mass, and has evidently been transported from a distance,\r\nfor its surface is smooth and rounded, the angles having been worn\r\naway by friction against other pebbles, produced by the agency of\r\nrunning water. I trace the stream to its source, half way up the hill,\r\nand find that it gushes out from a bed of gravel lying on a stratum of\r\nclay, which forms the eminence where I am standing, and is nearly 300\r\nfeet above the level of the British Channel. From this accumulation of\r\nwater-worn materials the pebble must have been removed by the torrent,\r\nand carried down to the spot where it first attracted our notice; but\r\nwe are still very far from having ascertained its origin. The bed of\r\nstones on the summit of this hill is clearly but a heap of transported\r\ngravel--an ancient sea-beach or shingle--formed of chalk-flints, that\r\nat some remote period were detached from their parent rock, and\r\nbroken, rolled, and thrown together, by the action of the waves. We are\r\ncertain of this because we know that flints cannot grow;[A] that they\r\nwere originally formed in the hollows or fissures of other stones; and\r\nupon inspecting the pebble more attentively, we perceive, not only that\r\nsuch was the case, but also that it has been moulded in _Chalk_, for it\r\ncontains the remains of certain species of extinct shells and corals,\r\nwhich are found exclusively in that rock. Here then a remarkable\r\nphenomenon presents itself for our consideration; this flint, now so\r\nhard and unyielding, must once have been in a soft or fluid state,\r\nfor the delicate markings of the case and spine of an _Echinus_, or\r\nSea-Urchin, are deeply impressed on its surface;[B] and a fragile shell\r\nwith its spines, is partially imbedded in its substance.[C] Nay more,\r\nupon breaking off one end of the pebble,[D] we find that a sponge, or\r\nsome analogous marine zoophyte, is entirely enveloped by the flint;\r\nand also that there are here and there portions of minute corals, and\r\nscales of fishes. What a \"_Medal of Creation_\" is here--what a page of\r\nnature's volume to interpret--what interesting reflections crowd upon\r\nthe mind!\r\n\r\n[A] \"_Flints cannot grow._\"--Here I would digress for a moment to\r\nnotice an opinion so generally prevalent, that perhaps some of my\r\nyoung readers will not be prepared at once to answer the question--_Do\r\nstones grow?_ The farmer who annually ploughs the same land, and\r\nobserves a fresh crop of stones every season, will probably reply in\r\nthe affirmative; and the general observer who has for successive years\r\nnoticed his gardens and plantations strewn with stones, notwithstanding\r\ntheir frequent removal, may possibly entertain the same opinion; but\r\na little reflection will show that stones cannot be said to grow or\r\nincrease, in the proper acceptation of the term. Animals and plants\r\ngrow, because they are provided with vessels and organs by winch they\r\nare capable of taking up particles of matter and converting them\r\ninto their own substance; but an inorganic body can only increase in\r\nbulk by the addition of some extraneous material; hence stones may\r\nbecome incrusted, or they may be cemented together and form a solid\r\nconglomerate, but they possess no inherent power by which they can\r\nincrease either in size or number--_they cannot grow_.\r\n\r\n[B] Plate I, _a_.\r\n\r\n[C] Plate I, _b_.\r\n\r\n[D] Plate I, _c_.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: FOSSIL ECHINUS WITH SPINES.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lign. 2:--Fossil Turban Echinus, with its\r\nspines; in limestone.\r\n\r\n(See '_Medals of Creation_', p. 340.)]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: FOSSIL SHELLS IN CHALK.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lign. 3:--Shell with spines, imbedded in Chalk;\r\nfrom Lewes. (See '_Medals of Creation_,' 1 p. 390.)]\r\n\r\nTo avoid confusion, we will reverse the order of our inquiry, and first\r\ncontemplate the formation of the flint in its native rock. The Chalk,\r\nthat beautiful white stone, which (as an American friend, who saw it\r\nfor the first time, observed), is so like an artificial production,\r\nabounds in marine shells and corals, and in the remains of fishes,\r\ncrabs, lobsters, and reptiles, all of which differ essentially from\r\nliving species; although a few of the corals and shells resemble, in\r\nsome particulars, certain kinds that inhabit the seas of hot climates.\r\nThese remains are found in so perfect a state--the shells with all\r\ntheir spines and delicate processes (_Lign. 3_), and the fishes with\r\ntheir teeth (_Lign, 4_), scales, and fins, entire--that no doubt can be\r\nentertained of the animals having been surrounded by the chalk while\r\nliving in their native sea, and that many of them were entombed in\r\ntheir stony sepulchres suddenly, when the rock was in the state of mud,\r\nor like liquid plaster of Paris.[E]\r\n\r\n[E] See Note I. _Shells in the Chalk._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lign. 4:--Fossil teeth of Fishes of the Shark\r\nfamily, in Chalk; from Lewes. (See '_Medals of Creation_.' p. 625.)]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: SHELLS AND FISHES IN CHALK.]\r\n\r\nBut besides the fossils which are obvious to the unassisted eye, the\r\nChalk teems with myriads of minute forms that may readily be detected\r\nwith a lens of moderate power; and even when these have been extracted,\r\nthe residue, which appears to be merely white calcareous earth, is\r\nfound, when examined under the microscope, to consist almost wholly of\r\nbodies yet more infinitesimal--of perfect shells and corals, so minute,\r\nthat a cubic inch of chalk may contain upwards of a million of these\r\norganic remains (see _Lign. 5_)!\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lign. 5:--A few grains of Chalk-dust highly\r\nmagnified, and shown to consist of shells, &c.\r\n\r\n  _a, a_, Shells called Rotalia.\r\n\r\n     _b_, ------------- Textularia.\r\n\r\n  (See '_Medals of Creation_,' p. 232.)\r\n\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Chalk is stratified--that is, divided into _strata_ or layers--as\r\nif a certain quantity of mud had sunk to the bottom of the sea, and\r\nenveloped the shells, corals, &c., which fell in its way, and had\r\nbecome somewhat solid before another layer was deposited upon it.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: FLINT NODULES AND VEINS.]\r\n\r\nThe mineral substance termed _silex_ or _flint_, is variously\r\ndistributed in the chalk. It most commonly occurs in the state of\r\nnodules of an irregular or spheroidal, globular figure, which are\r\narranged in rows parallel and alternating with, the cretaceous strata;\r\nit is likewise disposed in continuous thin layers, which are spread\r\nover considerable areas; and it often forms horizontal, vertical, and\r\noblique veins, that fill up the fissures and interstices of the chalk.\r\nThe siliceous nodules frequently enclose corals, shells, sponges,\r\nand other organic remains, as in the pebble before us; and in many\r\ninstances these fossils are found partly imbedded in the chalk and\r\npartly invested with flint. But though flints contain in abundance\r\nrelics of the same species of marine animals as the chalk, they are not\r\nlike that rock composed of an aggregation of fossil remains; on the\r\ncontrary, the siliceous earth, which is their constituent substance,\r\nwas evidently once in a state of complete solution in water, and\r\nprecipitated into the chalk before the latter was consolidated, the\r\norganic bodies serving as nuclei or centres around which the silex\r\nconcreted; for the deposition of the flint, like that of the chalk,\r\nappears to have taken place periodically.[F]\r\n\r\n[F] Note II. _Wood in flint._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lign. 6:--Minute fossil shells from Flint and\r\nChalk, very highly magnified, and seen by transmitted light.\r\n\r\n  1, 2, 3, 6, Rotaliæ;\r\n\r\n  4, Portion of a Nautilus;\r\n\r\n  5, Rotalia composed of flint.\r\n\r\n  (See '_Medals of Creation_,' p. 232.)\r\n\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: ANIMALCULES IN CHALK.]\r\n\r\nThe composition of the Chalk, and the prevalence throughout that rock\r\nof the relics of animals that can only live in salt-water, prove\r\nincontestably that the chalk and flint were deposited in the sea;\r\nand that our beautiful South Downs, now so smooth and verdant, and\r\nsupporting thousands of flocks and herds, and the rich plains and\r\nfertile valleys spread around their flanks, were once the bed of an\r\nocean. It is also evident not only that such must have been the case,\r\nbut also that the Chalk was deposited in the basin of a very _deep_\r\nsea--in the profound abyss of an ocean as vast as the Atlantic.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: AMMONITES AND NAUTILI.]\r\n\r\nFrom the absence of gravel, shingle, and sea-beach, it is certain that\r\nthe white chalk-strata were formed at a great distance from sea-shores\r\nand cliffs; and this inference is confirmed by the swarms of shells\r\ntermed _Ammonites_ and _Nautili_, which we know from their peculiar\r\nstructure were, like the recent pearly Nautilus, inhabitants of deep\r\nwaters only. For these are chambered shells; that is, are divided\r\ninternally by thin transverse shelly septa or plates, into numerous\r\ncells; the body of the animal occupied only the outer compartment,\r\nbut was connected with the entire series of chambers by a tube or\r\nsiphuncle, which passed through each partition. This mechanism\r\nconstituted an apparatus which contributed to the buoyancy of these\r\nanimals when afloat on the waves; for the Ammonites and Nautili were\r\nable to swim on the surface, or sink to the depths of the ocean at\r\npleasure.\r\n\r\n    The fragile Nautilus that steers his prow,\r\n    The sea-born sailor of his shell canoe,\r\n    The Ocean Mab, the fairy of the sea,\r\n    O'er the blue waves at will to roam is free.\r\n    He, when the lightning-winged tornadoes sweep\r\n    The surf, is safe, his home is in the deep;\r\n    And triumphs o'er the Armadas of mankind,\r\n    Which shake the world, yet crumble in the wind.\r\n\r\n                              Byron, _The Island_.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: WHITBY SNAKE-STONES.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lign. 7:--Ammonite from Whitby.]\r\n\r\nThe Ammonites, so called from the supposed resemblance of their shells\r\nto the fabled horn of Jupiter Ammon, are only known in a fossil state;\r\nbut they must have swarmed in the ancient seas, for several hundred\r\nspecies have been discovered in the Chalk and antecedent strata, though\r\nnone have been found in any deposits of more recent formation; at the\r\ntermination of the chalk epoch the whole race, therefore, appears to\r\nhave perished. The Ammonites are commonly termed _snake-stones_, from\r\nthe origin ascribed to them by local legends; those of Whitby are well\r\nknown (see _Lign. 7_).[G]\r\n\r\n[G] Note III. _Whitby Ammonites._\r\n\r\n    Thus Whitby's nuns exulting told--\r\n    How that of thousand snakes, each one\r\n    Was changed into a coil of stone,\r\n        When holy Hilda prayed:\r\n    Themselves, within their sacred bound,\r\n    Their stony folds had often found.\r\n\r\n                              Scott's _Marmion_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lign. 8:--Nautilus from the Chalk, near Lewes,\r\n(one-eighth the natural size.)]\r\n\r\nThe Nautili were the contemporaries of the Ammonites, and many kinds\r\nare found associated with those shells, in strata far more ancient than\r\nthe Chalk; and several species of both genera, as we have previously\r\nshown, were inhabitants of the cretaceous ocean. When the Ammonites\r\nbecame extinct, the Nautili continued to flourish, and numerous\r\nexamples occur in the strata that were deposited during the vast period\r\nwhich intervened between the close of the Chalk formation, and the\r\ndawn of the existing condition of the earth's surface. At the present\r\ntime two or three kinds only are known in a living state, and these are\r\nrestricted to the seas of tropical climes, and so seldom approach the\r\nshores, that but few specimens of the animals that inhabit the shells\r\nhave been obtained.\r\n\r\nThe Nautilus, therefore, is one of those types of animal organization\r\nthat have survived all the physical revolutions to which the surface of\r\nthe earth was subjected during the innumerable ages that preceded the\r\ncreation of the human race.[H] This remarkable fact is portrayed with\r\nmuch force and beauty by Mrs. Howitt, in the following stanzas:\r\n\r\n[H] Note IV. _Fossil Nautili._\r\n\r\nTO THE NAUTILUS.\r\n\r\n    Thou didst laugh at sun and breeze\r\n    In the new created seas;\r\n    Thou wast with the reptile broods\r\n    In the old sea solitudes,\r\n    Sailing in the new-made light,\r\n    With the curled-up Ammonite.\r\n    Thou surviv'dst the awful shock,\r\n    Which turn'd the ocean-bed to rock;\r\n    And chang'd its myriad living swarms\r\n    To the marble's veined forms.\r\n    Thou wert there, thy little boat,\r\n    Airy voyager! kept afloat,\r\n    O'er the waters wild and dismal,\r\n    O'er the yawning gulfs abysmal;\r\n    Amid wreck and overturning,\r\n    Rock-imbedding, heaving, burning,\r\n    Mid the tumult and the stir,\r\n    Thou, most ancient mariner!\r\n    In that pearly boat of thine,\r\n    Sail'dst upon the troubled brine.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE SEA-SHORE.]\r\n\r\nWe have thus acquired satisfactory proof that the flint of which our\r\npebble is composed, was once fluid in an ocean teeming with beings, of\r\ngenera and species unknown in a living state, and that it consolidated\r\nand became imbedded in the chalk, which was then being deposited at\r\nthe bottom of the sea; hence the shells, corals, and other organic\r\nremains, which we now find attached to its surface, and enclosed in\r\nits substance. Thus much for the origin of the pebble; let us next\r\ninquire by what means it was dislodged from its rocky sepulchre, cast\r\nup from the depths of the ocean, and transported to the summit of the\r\nhill whence it was dislodged by yonder torrent. If we stroll along the\r\nsea-shore, and observe the changes which are there going on, we shall\r\nobtain an answer to these questions; for\r\n\r\n    There is a _language_ by the lonely shore--\r\n    There is society where none intrudes,\r\n    By the deep Sea, and music in its roar!\r\n\r\n                              Byron.\r\n\r\nThe incessant dashing of the waves against the base of the\r\nchalk-cliffs, undermines the strata, and huge masses of rock are\r\nconstantly giving way and falling into the waters. The chalk then\r\nbecomes softened and disintegrated, and is quickly reduced to the state\r\nof mud, and transported to the tranquil depths of the ocean, where it\r\nsubsides and forms new deposits; but the flints thus detached, are\r\nbroken and rolled by attrition into the state of boulders, pebbles, and\r\ngravel, and ultimately of sand.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lign. 9:--View of Brighton Cliffs; looking\r\neastward from Kemp Town.[I]\r\n\r\n  _a.

It is therefore manifest,\r\nthat at some very distant period of the earth's physical history, the\r\nbed of the Chalk-ocean was broken up, extensive areas were protruded\r\nabove the waters, lines of sea-cliffs were formed, and boulders, sand,\r\nand shingle accumulated at their base. Subsequent elevations of the\r\nland took place, and finally, the sea-beach was raised to its present\r\nsituation, which is several hundred feet above the level of the sea!\r\n\r\nEvery part of the earth's surface presents unequivocal proofs that the\r\nelevation of the bed of the ocean in some places, and the subsidence\r\nof the dry land in others, have been, and are still, going on; and\r\nthat, in truth, the continual changes in the relative position of the\r\nland and water, are the effects of laws which the Divine Author of\r\nthe Universe has impressed on matter, and thus rendered it capable of\r\nperpetual renovation:--\r\n\r\n    Art, Empire, Earth itself, to change are doomed;\r\n    Earthquakes have raised to heaven the humble vale,\r\n    And gulfs the mountain's mighty mass entombed,\r\n    And where the Atlantic rolls wide continents have bloomed.\r\n\r\n                              Beattie.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: IMMUTABILITY OF THE SEA.]\r\n\r\nOur noble poet, Lord Byron, in his sublime apostrophe to the Sea,\r\nhas most eloquently enunciated the startling fact revealed by modern\r\ngeological researches,--namely, that if the character of immutability\r\nbe attributable to anything on the surface of our planet, it is to the\r\nocean and not to the land!--\r\n\r\n      Roll on, thou deep and dark blue ocean--roll!\r\n      Ten thousand fleets sweep over thee in vain;\r\n      Man marks the earth with ruin--his controul\r\n      Stops with the shore:--upon the watery plain\r\n      The wrecks are all thy deed, nor doth remain\r\n      A shadow of man's ravage, save his own.\r\n      When, for a moment, like a drop of rain.\r\n      He sinks into thy depths with bubbling groan,\r\n    Without a grave, unknell'd, uncoffin'd, and unknown!\r\n\r\n      Thy shores are empires, changed in all save thee,--\r\n      Assyria, Greece, Rome, Carthage, what are they?\r\n      Thy waters wasted them while they were free,\r\n      And many a tyrant since; their shores obey\r\n      The stranger, slave, or savage,--their decay\r\n      Has dried up realms to deserts:--not so thou,\r\n      Unchangeable, save to thy wild waves' play--\r\n      _Time writes no wrinkle on thine azure brow:_\r\n    _Such as Creation's dawn beheld, thou rollest now!_\r\n\r\n      Thou glorious mirror, where the Almighty's form\r\n      Glasses itself in tempests; in all time,\r\n      Calm or convulsed--in breeze, or gale, or storm,\r\n      Icing the Pole, or in the torrid clime\r\n      Dark-heaving, boundless, endless, and sublime--\r\n      The image of Eternity--the throne\r\n      Of the Invisible; even from out thy slime\r\n      The monsters of the deep are made; each zone\r\n    Obeys thee: thou goest forth, dread, fathomless, alone!\r\n\r\n                              Childe Harold. _Canto IV._\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: APOSTROPHE TO THE OCEAN.]\r\n\r\nI will conclude this \"first lesson\" with the following beautiful\r\nremark of an eminent living philosopher:[J]--\"To discover order and\r\nintelligence, in scenes of apparent wildness and confusion, is the\r\npleasing task of the geological inquirer; who recognises, in the\r\nchanges which are continually taking place on the surface of the globe,\r\na series of necessary operations, by which the harmony, beauty, and\r\nintegrity of the Universe are maintained and perpetuated; and which\r\nmust be regarded, not as symptoms of frailty or decay, but as wise\r\nprovisions of the Supreme Cause, to ensure that circle of changes, so\r\nessential to animal and vegetable existence.\"\r\n\r\n[J] Dr. Paris.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             MORE THOUGHTS\r\n\r\n                                 ON A\r\n\r\n                                PEBBLE.\r\n\r\n  \"Not a mote in the beam, not an herb on the mountain, not a pebble\r\n  on the shore, not a seed far-blown into the wilderness, but contributes\r\n  to the lore that seeks in all the true principle of life--the\r\n  beautiful--the joyous--the immortal.\"\r\n\r\n                                       Sir E.

To ascertain if this\r\ninference is correct, it will be necessary to divide the stone in a\r\nlongitudinal direction--but I will first strike off a small fragment,\r\nand examine it by the aid of a microscope.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: FOSSIL ANIMALCULES.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lign. 10:--Fossil animalcules (_Xanthidia_) in\r\nFlint.]\r\n\r\nBy a sharp blow of a hammer, a very thin and minute portion of the\r\nflint has been detached (see _Lign. 10, fig. 1_); it is translucent,\r\nand when held between the eye and a strong light, appears like a slice\r\nof horn; and a few extremely minute specks may with difficulty be\r\ndetected. Under the microscope, five of these almost invisible points\r\nare well defined, and present a radiated appearance (see _fig. 3_); but\r\nI will substitute a higher power, and lo! they are seen to be distinct\r\nglobular or spherical bodies beset with spines (_fig. 3_); and with a\r\nstill more powerful lens, one which magnifies many hundred times, their\r\nnature is completely displayed. The whole five possess this general\r\ncharacter--a central globular case or shell, from which radiate tubes\r\nor hollow spines, that terminate in fringed or divided extremities\r\n(_figs. 4, 5, 6_); but these bodies differ from each other in the\r\nrelative proportions of the shell and spines, and in the number,\r\nshape, and length of the tubular appendages. The group, in short, is\r\nseparable into three distinct species, of the same kind of fossil\r\nremains; and several other varieties occur in the chalk and flint. .\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: XANTHIDIA IN FLINT.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lign. 11:--_Xanthidium palmatum_ in flint:\r\nhighly magnified.]\r\n\r\nBut what are these bodies?--They are the durable cases of animalcules,\r\nmany species of which swarm in our seas, and are so minute, that\r\nthousands may be contained in a drop of water! In a living state,\r\nthe case is flexible and filled with a granular jelly, which is the\r\nsoft body of the animalcule, and the tubes and the outer surface are\r\ninvested with a similar substance. After death the soft parts dissolve;\r\nbut the case and its spines often remain unchanged.\r\n\r\nIn another magnified portion of the pebble, a specimen of the\r\nmicroscopic discoidal shells which we have already seen compose the\r\ngreater part of the white chalk (_Lign. 5_, p. 14), is beautifully\r\ndisplayed when viewed by transmitted light, under a highly magnifying\r\npower (_Lign. 12_).[K] Our investigation has thus shown, that a great\r\npart of the pebble is actually composed of the aggregated fossil\r\nremains of animalcules, so minute as to elude our unassisted vision,\r\nbut which the magic power of the microscope reveals to us, preserved,\r\nlike flies in amber, in all their original sharpness of outline and\r\ndelicacy of structure.\r\n\r\n[K] Note VI. _Rotaliæ in chalk and flint._\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: ROTALIA IN FLINT.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lign. 12:--Rotalia in flint: highly magnified.]\r\n\r\nOn another fragment of this stone two glittering specks, not larger\r\nthan a pin's head, are discernible (_Lign. 9_): these with a magnifier\r\nof moderate power, are seen at a glance to be scales of fishes. But\r\nthey differ from each other; both have the surface smooth, and without\r\nenamel: in the one the margin or edge is simple (_fig. 3_); in the\r\nother, it is divided like the teeth of a comb (_fig. 2_);--trifling as\r\nthis difference may appear, it is sufficient to enable the naturalist\r\nto determine that the fishes which furnished these scales belonged to\r\ntwo distinct orders, of which the Salmon and the Mullet are living\r\nexamples.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lign. 13:--Scales of Fishes in flint.\r\n\r\n  Fig. 1.--A fragment of the pebble with the scales of the natural size.\r\n\r\n       2.--One of the Scales (of a species of _Beryx_) highly magnified.\r\n\r\n       3.--The other Scale (of a species of _Salmo_).\r\n\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Plate II._\r\n\r\n_Longitudinal section of the Pebble._\r\n\r\n_Page 41._]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: SECTION OF THE PEBBLE.]\r\n\r\nSECTION OF THE PEBBLE.\r\n\r\n_Plate II._\r\n\r\n\r\nWe will now avail ourselves of the assistance of the lapidary, and\r\ndivide the pebble in a longitudinal direction;--what a beautiful and\r\ninteresting section is thus obtained! The markings observable on the\r\nfractured portion of the stone (see Plate I, c), are thus\r\nshown to have originated, as we surmised, from some organic body,\r\nwhich the flint, when fluid, had penetrated and enveloped. The enclosed\r\nfossil was obviously one of those soft marine zoophytes, allied to the\r\n_Actiniæ_ or _Sea-Anemones_, which are of a globular, spherical, or\r\ninversely conical shape, and consist of a tough, jelly-like substance,\r\npermeated with tubes, disposed in a radiated manner around a central\r\ncavity, or digestive sac; a structure admitting of that constant supply\r\nand circulation of sea-water, which the economy of these curious forms\r\nof animal existence requires.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: ISLE OF WIGHT PEBBLES.]\r\n\r\nThe surface exposed by the division of the pebble, is an oblique\r\nvertical section of the petrified zoophyte. It shows a central canal\r\nfilled with bluish-grey flint (_Plate II, c_), in a mass traversed by\r\ntubes or channels, which possess considerable beauty and variety of\r\ncolour from an impregnation of iron.[L] A transverse section (see\r\n_Lign. 14._ fig. 1) would, of course, have a central spot, with rays\r\nproceeding thence to the circumference, as in the oblique fracture\r\n(_Plate I, c_).[M]\r\n\r\n[L] Specimens of this kind form beautiful objects when polished, and\r\nare mounted as brooches by the lapidaries of Brighton, Bognor, and\r\nthe Isle of Wight, who term them petrified sea-animal flowers.

It was\r\nattached to a rock, stone, or shell, by root-like fibres which spread\r\nout from its base; and its soft body was strengthened, as is the case\r\nin many sponges and animals of a similar nature, by numerous siliceous\r\nspines or spicula, which are often found in the flint and chalk (see\r\n_Lign. 10._ fig. 5).[N]\r\n\r\n[N] Note VIII. _Zoophytes of the Chalk._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lign. 14:--Choanites _Konigi_: from\r\nthe Chalk.\r\n\r\n  Fig. 1.--A transverse section.\r\n\r\n       2.--Upper portion of the body.\r\n\r\n       3.--Vertical section, like the pebble, Pl.

Richardson, Esq.\r\n\r\n    The Nautilus and the Ammonite\r\n        Were launch'd in storm and strife;\r\n    Each sent to float, in its tiny boat,\r\n        On the wide, wild sea of life.\r\n\r\n    And each could swim on the ocean's brim,\r\n        And anon, its sails could furl;\r\n    And sink to sleep in the great sea deep,\r\n        In a palace all of pearl.\r\n\r\n    And their's was a bliss, more fair than this,\r\n        That we feel in our colder time;\r\n    For they were rife in a tropic life,\r\n        In a brighter, happier clime.\r\n\r\n    They swam 'mid isles, whose summer smiles\r\n        No wintry winds annoy;\r\n    Whose groves were palm, whose air was balm.\r\n        Where life was only joy.\r\n\r\n    They roam'd all day, through creek and bay,\r\n        And travers'd the ocean deep;\r\n    And at night they sank on a coral bank,\r\n        In its fairy bowers to sleep.\r\n\r\n    And the monsters vast, of ages past.\r\n        They beheld in their ocean caves;\r\n    And saw them ride, in their power and pride,\r\n        And sink in their billowy graves.\r\n\r\n    Thus hand in hand, from strand to strand,\r\n        They sail'd in mirth and glee;\r\n    Those fairy shells, with their crystal cells,\r\n        Twin creatures of the sea.\r\n\r\n    But they came at last, to a sea long past,\r\n        And as they reach'd its shore,\r\n    The Almighty's breath spake out in death,\r\n        And the Ammonite liv'd no more.\r\n\r\n    And the Nautilus now, in its shelly prow,\r\n        As o'er the deep it strays,\r\n    Still seems to seek, in bay and creek,\r\n        Its companion of other days.\r\n\r\n    And thus do we, in life's stormy sea,\r\n        As we roam from shore to shore;\r\n    While tempest-tost, seek the lov'd--the lost--\r\n        But find them on earth no more!\r\n\r\nGeology, in the magnitude and sublimity of the objects of which it\r\ntreats, ranks next to Astronomy in the scale of the sciences.\r\n\r\n                                                 Sir J.

Page 13. _Shells in Chalk._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe shells of mollusca, in consequence of their durability, are the\r\nmost abundant fossils in the sedimentary strata;[X] entire layers\r\nof marble and other limestone, of great thickness and extent, are\r\nwholly composed of an aggregation of a few species or genera: in some\r\ninstances of fresh-water snails--as, for example, the Sussex and\r\nPurbeck marbles;[Y] in others, of marine bivalves and univalves, as the\r\noyster-conglomerate of Bromley, and the shelly limestones of Portland,\r\nDorsetshire, &c.\r\n\r\n[X] For an account of the geological value of fossil shells, see\r\n'_Medals of Creation_,' vol. i. p. 363.\r\n\r\n[Y] See '_Wonders of Geology_,' 6th Edition, p. 402.\r\n\r\nThe cretaceous strata contain many hundred species of bivalves and\r\nunivalves, by far the greater part of which belong to extinct genera;\r\nand the species, with but four or five exceptions, are unknown in more\r\nrecent deposits. In loose sandy strata, fossil shells are oftentimes\r\nbeautifully preserved, and may be obtained in as perfect a condition\r\nas if gathered from the sands on the sea-shores: such is the state of\r\nthe specimens which abound in the sandy clays near Barton in Hampshire,\r\nand in the \"_Crag_\" of Essex and Suffolk. In certain beds of clay,\r\nshells are also found entire; sometimes retaining the epidermis, and\r\nthe cartilaginous ligament of the hinge. The bivalves in the white\r\nchalk are generally perfect; but the univalves, probably from the more\r\ndelicate structure of the originals, seldom retain any vestiges of the\r\nshell, excepting portions of the internal nacreous coat adhering to the\r\nchalk casts, which have been moulded in the interior of the shells.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lign. 19:--Bivalve shells (_Terebratulæ_) from\r\nChalk (_natural size_).\r\n\r\n  1, 2.

Among the bivalves that prevail in the\r\nEnglish chalk, are three or four kinds of _Terebratulæ_: which are\r\nsmall, elegant, subglobular shells, belonging to a family of which\r\nnearly 500 species, referable to several genera, have been obtained\r\nfrom the British strata.[Z] Certain genera are restricted to the most\r\nancient sedimentary rocks, in which they occur in almost incredible\r\nnumbers; others have a wider range and are met with in the later\r\nsecondary deposits; while a few are found in the newest beds, and\r\nhave living representative species in the seas of warm climates. From\r\nthe immense antiquity of their lineage, these _Terebratulæ_ have been\r\nhumourously termed the \"_fossil aristocracy_.\" Some of the most common\r\nchalk species are figured of the natural size in _Lign. 19_. When\r\nliving the animal was attached to a rock or other body by means of a\r\n_byssus_ or peduncle, exserted through the aperture in the beak or\r\ncurved extremity of the largest valve.[AA] The shells of the smooth\r\n_Terebratulæ_ are full of minute holes or perforations, which may\r\nreadily be distinguished with a lens of moderate power.\r\n\r\n[Z] See '_Wonders of Geology_,' 6th Edit. p. 329.\r\n\r\n[AA] In the Conchological Gallery of the British Museum there is a\r\ngroup of thirty or forty recent _Terebratulæ_ attached to a stone by\r\ntheir peduncles; from Australia.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: PETRIFIED OYSTER.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lign. 20:--Oyster from the Chalk, near Brighton\r\n(natural size).]\r\n\r\nOccasionally the soft body of the mollusk completely silicified--that\r\nis, transmuted into flint--is found in its natural position in the\r\nshell. A beautiful example of this kind is represented in _Lign. 20_.\r\nIt is an extinct species of oyster: both valves were entire when I\r\nremoved the chalk and cleared the specimen; part of one valve has\r\nbeen broken away to expose the petrified body of the animal. I have\r\nseen a _Trigonia_[AB] from the oolite of Tisbury in Wiltshire, in\r\nwhich the entire body of the mollusk was transformed into flint, and\r\nthe _branchiæ_ or lamellated gills were beautifully defined, though\r\nconverted into semi-transparent chalcedony.\r\n\r\n[AB] _Trigonia:_ a genus of bivalves, of which there are many extinct\r\nspecies in the chalk and oolite; some bands of Portland stone are an\r\naggregation of _Trigoniæ:_ a few very small species, inhabitants of the\r\nseas of Australia and New Zealand, are the only known living forms of\r\nthis once prevailing type of mollusca.

Page 17. _Wood in Flint._\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: WOOD IN FLINT.]\r\n\r\nI would remind the reader that the white chalk, together with the\r\nvarious strata of sand, clay, and limestone, comprising the cretaceous\r\nformation of England, must be regarded as an ancient ocean-bed; in\r\nother words, an accumulation of earthy sediments, formed in the\r\nprofound depths of the sea, in periods of long duration and of\r\nincalculable antiquity, and more or less consolidated by subsequent\r\nchemical and mechanical agency. These deposits are made up of organic\r\nand inorganic materials: the former consist of the debris of the cliffs\r\nand shores which encompassed the ancient ocean, of the spoils of the\r\nland brought into the waters by floods and rivers, and of mineral\r\nmatter thrown down from chemical solutions. The organic substances\r\nare the durable remains of the animals and plants which lived and\r\ndied in the sea, and of terrestrial and fluviatile species that were\r\ntransported from islands or continents by rivers and their tributaries.\r\nThe whole constitutes such an assemblage of strata as would probably be\r\npresented to observation, if a mass of the bed of the Atlantic 2,000\r\nfeet in thickness, were elevated above the waters, and became dry land;\r\nthe only essential difference would be in the generic and specific\r\ncharacters of the imbedded animal and vegetable remains.\r\n\r\nThe vestiges of terrestrial and fluviatile animals and plants found in\r\nthe chalk are comparatively but few: I have collected from Kent and\r\nSussex, bones of gigantic land lizards, (the _Iguanodon_), of flying\r\nreptiles, (_Pterodactyles_), and of fresh-water Turtles, and water-worn\r\nfragments of stems of coniferous trees allied to the _Araucaria_ or\r\nNorfolk Island Pine; fruits or aments of coniferse; and stems and\r\nfoliage of plants related to the _Cycas_ and _Zamia_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lign. 21:--Fragment of coniferous wood in flint.]\r\n\r\nA fragment of silicified wood imbedded in a flint, is represented in\r\n_Lign. 21_. It was obtained from a wall in Lewes Priory in Sussex; and\r\nthough it has been exposed to the atmosphere seven or eight centuries,\r\nstill exhibits the characteristic internal structure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNote III.

Dufresnoyi_: 2_a_, part of the same.\r\n\r\n  3. _A. lautus_: 3_a_, keel and septum of the same.\r\n\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe Ammonites differ from the Nautili in having the margins of the\r\nsepta or internal shelly partitions (which in the latter are smooth),\r\nfoliated or wrinkled; and the siphunculus or tube placed along the\r\nback of the shell, whereas in the Nautilus it is central. The sides of\r\nthe shell in the Ammonites are very generally more or less ornamented\r\nwith arched elevations and depressions, and studded with spines and\r\ntubercles, as in the specimens above figured.\r\n\r\nThere are several kinds of Ammonites found in the Lias at Whitby and\r\nother places in Yorkshire; the most common species is figured in\r\n_Lign. 7_. p. 20; the dark colour of this fossil is produced by the\r\nargillaceous stone with which it is now filled. The internal structure\r\nof these Ammonites is generally well preserved, the chambers being\r\nlined with spar or other mineral matter; transverse polished sections\r\nare often very beautiful from the several cells being occupied by\r\nvariously coloured marble, susceptible of a high polish. (Pl. III.) In\r\nsome examples the entire shell is transmuted into brilliant pyrites\r\n(sulphuret of iron), and the chambers are filled with white spar; a\r\nspecimen of this kind in my possession, collected by Lady Murchison, is\r\nthe most elegant fossil imaginable.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Plate III._\r\n\r\n_Polished section of an Ammonite._\r\n\r\n_Page 70._]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: AMMONITE-MARBLE.]\r\n\r\nIt is not unusual for the visitors at Whitby to inquire of the\r\ncollectors how it is that the head of the animal is never found?\r\nand the crafty dealers, willing to accommodate the taste of their\r\ncustomers, carve the extremity of an Ammonite into the semblance of\r\na serpent's head, and affix two red eyes; thus producing a veritable\r\nproof of the truth of the legend of St. Hilda! My young readers will\r\nnot be duped by this trick-of-trade, if they reflect but a moment on\r\nthe real nature of a fossil Ammonite: they will remember that it is a\r\nshell which, when empty, became filled with what was then soft mud, but\r\nis now stone; in like manner as if liquid plaster of Paris were poured\r\ninto an empty snail-shell and consolidated.\r\n\r\nIn some parts of Somersetshire, a beautiful marble composed of an\r\naggregation of two or three small species of Ammonites, is used for\r\nsideboards and other ornamental purposes: the polished slabs are\r\ndiversified by the numerous sections of the shells.\r\n\r\nSome of the clays of the Lias abound in a species of Ammonite of\r\nextraordinary beauty from the iridescent lustre of the pearly coat of\r\nthe shell: a slab of stone from Watchett, on which a hundred or more\r\nAmmonites of this kind are displayed, may be seen in the British Museum.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNote IV. Page 23. _Fossil Nautili._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe beauty, elegant form, and remarkable internal structure of the\r\nshell of the Nautilus, have rendered it in all ages an object of\r\ncuriosity and admiration: yet an accurate knowledge of the organization\r\nof the animal to which it belongs, has but recently been obtained. The\r\nNautili may be regarded as Cuttle-fish or _Sepiæ_, inhabiting shells\r\nfurnished with an apparatus to impart buoyancy, and enable the animals\r\nto swim on the surface, or sink to the profound depths of the ocean.\r\nA few explanatory remarks on the nature of the recent Sepia may be\r\nnecessary to render the subject intelligible to the unscientific reader.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: RECENT NAUTILUS.]\r\n\r\nThe _Sepia_ or Cuttle-fish of our seas is of an oblong form, and\r\ncomposed of a soft substance covered with a tough integument or skin:\r\nit varies from a few inches to a foot or more in length. The mouth\r\nis placed in the centre of one extremity of the body, and has a\r\npair of powerful, curved, horny mandibles, much resembling the beaks\r\nof a parrot: it is surrounded by eight long arms like the rays of a\r\nstar-fish, and these are beset with rows of little cups which act as\r\nsuckers, and enable the animal to secure its prey, and attach itself\r\nwith great firmness to any object.[AC] It has a distinct head, with\r\ntwo eyes as perfect as in the vertebrated animals, and complicated\r\norgans of hearing: and below the head there is a tube or funnel which\r\nacts as a locomotive instrument, and propels the animal backwards by\r\nthe forcible ejection of the water which has served the purpose of\r\nrespiration, and can be thrown out with considerable force by the\r\ncontraction of the body. The soft parts are supported by a large\r\ninternal bone or osselet of a very curious structure, which, when dried\r\nand reduced to powder, forms the substance used by scriveners, termed\r\n_pounce_. These naked mollusca also possess a membranous bag or sac,\r\ncontaining a dark-coloured fluid resembling ink in appearance, which\r\nthey eject into the surrounding water upon the approach of danger, and\r\nby the obscurity thus induced foil the pursuit of their enemies. This\r\nfluid, when inspissated, forms the base of the colour termed _sepia_ by\r\nartists.\r\n\r\n[AC] From this arrangement of the organs of prehension around the head,\r\nthis order of mollusca is termed the _Cephalopoda_; _i. e._, the feet\r\naround the head.\r\n\r\nThe body of the Nautilus resembles in its essential characters that of\r\nthe Cuttle-fish, and occupies the large outer receptacle of the shell;\r\nmaintaining a connection with the inner compartments by means of the\r\nmembranous siphunculus or tube, which is only partially invested with\r\nshell. The internal chambers are air-cells, and the animal can fill\r\nthe siphunculus with fluid, or exhaust it at will; the difference thus\r\neffected in its specific gravity enables it to rise to the surface or\r\nsink to the bottom with facility. Now if' we imagine a Cuttle-fish\r\nplaced in the outer chamber of a Nautilus-shell, and provided with a\r\nsiphuncule, but having neither ink-bag nor osselet--these organs being\r\nunnecessary to an animal possessing a chambered shell--we shall have a\r\ngeneral idea of the nature of the recent species.\r\n\r\nThe Nautilus is essentially an inhabitant of deep water: it creeps\r\nalong the ground at the bottom of the sea, with its shell upwards like\r\nthe snail; and by means of its arms can proceed with considerable\r\nspeed.[AD]\r\n\r\n[AD] See '_Conchologia Systematica_,' vol. ii. p. 302, and '_Elements\r\nof Conchology_,' p. 22, by Mr. Lovell Reeve, F.L.S., for an admirable\r\ndescription of the recent Nautilus, with illustrations.\r\n\r\nA large and splendid species of fossil Nautilus is not uncommon in the\r\nLondon Clay of the Isle of Sheppey, Sussex, and Hampshire. The chambers\r\nare often lined with spar or other brilliant mineral matter; and\r\npolished sections, like those of the Ammonites, admirably display the\r\ninternal structure.[AE]\r\n\r\n[AE] See Dr. Buckland's '_Bridgewater Treatise_' for numerous figures\r\nof Ammonites and Nautili; _plates_ 31 to 34. Consult also '_Medals of\r\nCreation_,' vol. ii. p. 457.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNote V. Page 27. _Brighton Cliffs._\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: BRIGHTON CLIFFS.]\r\n\r\nThe stranger who approaches Brighton by the railroads through deep\r\ntunnels and cuttings in the chalk, and perceives the town spread\r\nover the plain and on the sides of a valley of the South Downs, will\r\nnaturally expect to find the sea-shore bounded by chalk-cliffs. But\r\na wall of admirable construction, extends from the Steyne to beyond\r\nKemptown, and effectually conceals from view the materials that\r\ncompose the site of that part of Brighton; a ramble along the shore to\r\nRottingdean is therefore necessary to reveal to the inquiring observer,\r\nthe nature of the strata that flank the southern border of the Downs.\r\n\r\nThe sketch given in page 27, represents the appearance of part of the\r\ncoast to the east of Kemptown. The base of the cliff to the height of a\r\nfew feet, is seen to consist of the white chalk with its usual layers\r\nof flint nodules, forming a low wall or terrace, which slopes seaward,\r\nand extends far into the British channel--probably to the opposite\r\ncoast of France: at low-water a considerable expanse of modern shingle\r\nand sand is spread over, and in a great measure conceals, the chalk,\r\nat a few yards distance from the cliff. Upon the terrace of chalk, at\r\nthe height of from ten to fifteen feet above the modern beach, there\r\nis a bed of pebbles and sand, containing also a considerable number\r\nof boulders of granite, porphyry, and other crystalline rocks foreign\r\nto the south-east of England: in fact, a sea-beach, which must have\r\nbeen formed at some remote period, in the same manner as the modern\r\nshingle. Upon this ancient beach are strata of loam, and chalk-rubble,\r\nwith flints partially water-worn, and boulders of sandstone, breccia,\r\ngranite, &c., constituting the upper sixty or eighty feet of the cliff.\r\nIn these beds, and also in the ancient shingle, many teeth and bones of\r\nmammoths (extinct species of elephant), horse, deer, oxen, and other\r\nruminants, and bones of whales, have been discovered.[AF]\r\n\r\n[AF] See '_Medals of Creation_,' p. 914.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE SUSSEX COAST.]\r\n\r\nA few hundred yards beyond Kemptown the inroads of the sea have\r\ndestroyed all vestiges of the strata above described, and the cliffs\r\nconsist of a perpendicular wall of chalk; if we extend our walk to\r\nRottingdean, we shall perceive here and there isolated patches of the\r\nancient shingle, and of the calcareous strata containing elephants'\r\nbones.\r\n\r\nThe appearances described demonstrate the following changes in this\r\npart of the Sussex coast. _Firstly_, the chalk terrace (_Lign. 9, c_;\r\np. 27) on which the ancient shingle (_b_) rests, was on a level with\r\nthe sea for a long period; for this beach must have been accumulated,\r\nlike the modern, by the action of the waves on the then existing chalk\r\ncliffs. But there must also have been some cause not now in operation,\r\nby which pebbles, and boulders of granite and other rocks foreign to\r\nthis coast, with bones of extinct mammalia, &c., were thrown up on\r\nthe strand, and imbedded in the beach then in progress of formation.\r\nThese materials were probably brought from some distant part of the\r\nthen continental shores by floating ice: an agency by which delicate\r\nbones and shells may be transported and deposited without injury amidst\r\npebbles and boulders.\r\n\r\n_Secondly._ The whole line of coast with the ancient shingle must\r\nhave subsided to such a depth as to admit of the deposition of the\r\ncalcareous materials forming the \"Elephant bed;\" and from the absence\r\nof beach and shingle in these strata, it may be inferred that this\r\ndeposition took place in tranquil water: possibly at that period this\r\npart of the Sussex coast formed a sheltered bay.\r\n\r\n_Lastly._ The land was elevated to its present level, and the formation\r\nof the modern sea-beach and cliffs commenced.[AG]\r\n\r\n[AG] See '_Medals of Creation_,' \"On the Geological structure of\r\nBrighton Cliffs,\" p. 913.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNote VI. Page 38. _Rotaliæ in Chalk and Flint._\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: FOSSIL FORAMINIFERA.]\r\n\r\nThe shells called _Rotaliæ_ (see _Lign._ 5 and 6, p. 14 and 16) belong\r\nto a group of marine animals of very simple organization, and which\r\npresent great variety in the form and markings of their testaceous\r\ncoverings; but they all agree in having the sides of the shell pierced\r\nby numerous holes or foramina; whence the scientific term of the\r\nOrder, _Foraminifera_, is derived: these openings are for the egress\r\nof delicate filaments, which appear to be organs of progression and\r\nrespiration.\r\n\r\nThe _Foraminifera_ are, with but few exceptions, exceedingly minute;\r\nin an ounce of sea-sand, between three and four millions have been\r\ndetected. The body of these animalcules consists of uniform granules\r\nenclosed in a skin or integument, having one or more digestive sacs\r\nor cavities; these creatures appear, in fact, to be mere polypes,\r\nprotected by testaceous coverings. Some have but a single cell; others\r\nhave many, disposed in a conical or cylindrical form; many kinds, of\r\nwhich the _Rotaliæ_ are examples, are discoidal involutes, and divided\r\ninternally by septa into distinct chambers:[AH] they resemble in this\r\nrespect the shell of the Nautilus, but are readily distinguished by the\r\nperforations.\r\n\r\n[AH] See '_Wonders of Geology_,' 6th Edit. p. 322.\r\n\r\nAll the various kinds of _Foraminifera_ swarm in the present seas,\r\nand were not less numerous in the ancient ocean. We have seen that\r\nthe white chalk almost wholly consists of a few genera of these\r\nanimalcules; and in many strata of sand they are so abundant, that\r\na cubic inch of the mass contains upwards of sixty thousand. In the\r\n_Rotalia_, the body is entirely enclosed within the shell, and occupies\r\nall the cells; and long, soft, tentacula are sent off through the\r\nforamina. The shell, therefore, though resembling in form that of\r\nthe Nautilus, is essentially different; for in the latter, the outer\r\nchamber only is occupied by the body of the animal, the internal ones\r\nbeing successively quitted empty dwellings; whereas, in the _Rotaliæ_\r\nand analogous _Polythalamia_,[AI] all the cells are contemporaneously\r\nfilled by the soft parts of the animalcule.\r\n\r\n[AI] _Polythalamia, many-chambered_, is a general term applied to these\r\nshells.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: RECENT FORAMINIFERA.]\r\n\r\nWhen the shell is removed, which is readily effected by immersion in\r\ndiluted hydrochloric acid, the body is exposed, and found to consist\r\nof a series of lobes or sacs, united by a tube corresponding somewhat\r\nin its position with the siphuncle of the Nautilus, but which is the\r\ndigestive canal. The body of a recent animalcule of this kind, deprived\r\nof the shell, is figured in _Lign. 23_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lign. 23:--The body of a recent animalcule\r\nallied to the _Rotalia_, deprived of its shell; _highly magnified_.]\r\n\r\nNot only the characters of fossil shells of such infinite minuteness\r\ncan be revealed by the microscope, but even the soft parts of the\r\nanimalcules which inhabited them; for these are occasionally preserved,\r\nand may be demonstrated with as much distinctness as the recent\r\nexamples.[AJ] In flint the soft parts of _Rotaliæ_, _Textulariæ_,\r\n&c., are abundant, and may be seen, with but little preparation, like\r\ninsects in amber: the specimen figured in _Lign. 12_, p. 39, shews\r\nthe body of a _Rotalia_ well defined; the only preparation this atom\r\nof flint has undergone, is immersion in Canada balsam. To detect such\r\ndelicate structures in chalk requires, however, some experience in\r\nmicroscopic manipulation, as the calcareous matter must be dissolved\r\nin hydrochloric acid, and the animal substance separated from the\r\nresiduum.[AK]\r\n\r\n[AJ] See '_Wonders of Geology_,' 6th Edit., p. 322.\r\n\r\n[AK] See my '_Memoir on the fossil remains of the soft parts of\r\nForaminifera in Chalk, &c._' Philosophical Transactions, 1846, p. 465.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNote VII. Page 43. _Isle of Wight Pebbles._\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: ISLE OF WIGHT PEBBLES.]\r\n\r\nThe nodules and veins of flint that are so abundant in the upper\r\nchalk, have probably been produced by the agency of heated waters\r\nand vapours; the perfect fluidity of the siliceous matter before its\r\nconsolidation is proved, not only by the sharp moulds and impressions\r\nof shells and other organisms retained by the flints, but also by the\r\npresence of numerous remains in the substance of the nodules, and the\r\nsilicified condition of the sponges and other zoophytes which abound in\r\nthe cretaceous strata.\r\n\r\nNow although silex, or the earth of flint, is but sparingly soluble in\r\nwater of the ordinary temperature, its solution readily takes places\r\nin vapour heated a little above that of fused cast iron, as has been\r\nproved by direct experiment;[AL] and similar effects are being produced\r\nat the present moment by natural causes. The siliceous deposits thrown\r\ndown by the intermittent boiling fountains, called the Geysers, in\r\nIceland, are well known;[AM] and in New Zealand this phenomenon is\r\nexhibited on a still grander scale. From the crater of the volcanic\r\nmountain of Tongariro,[AN] which is several thousand feet above the\r\nlevel of the sea, jets of vapour and streams of boiling water highly\r\ncharged with silex, are continually issuing forth, and dashing down\r\nthe flanks of the volcano in cascades and torrents, empty themselves\r\ninto the lakes at its base. As the water cools, siliceous sinter is\r\ndeposited in vast sheets, and incrustations of flint form around the\r\nextraneous substances lying in the course of the thermal streams. Silex\r\nis also precipitated by the boiling waters in stalagmitic concretions,\r\nand in nodules resembling in colour and solidity the flints of the\r\nEnglish chalk. The complete impregnation and silicification of\r\norganized bodies is attributable to an agency of this kind; and\r\nalthough the origin of the siliceous waters that deposited the nodules\r\nand veins of flint in the chalk is still involved in obscurity, the\r\nmode in which the latter were formed is satisfactorily elucidated.\r\n\r\n[AL] See '_Wonders of Geology_,' p. 100.\r\n\r\n[AM] Ibid., p. 95.\r\n\r\n[AN] Ibid., p. 98.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lign. 24:--Zoophytes in Chalk and Flint.\r\n\r\n  1.

Pebble enclosing a zoophyte.\r\n\r\n]\r\n\r\nOf the perfect transmutation into flint of the most delicate organic\r\nstructures, the pebbles strewn along the sea-shore of the south coast\r\nof England, afford a beautiful illustration; those from the Isle of\r\nWight are especially celebrated for their rich and varied colours.\r\nThe most common and interesting are those which exhibit sections of\r\nChoanites, as in the specimen which suggested the reflections embodied\r\nin these pages. Other allied forms are scarcely less beautiful; the\r\npetrified zoophytes called _Siphonia_, which, when living, consisted\r\nof a soft mass traversed by tubes, for the free ingress and egress of\r\nthe water, often display the internal structure of the original: as\r\nin the polished transverse section figured above, _Lign. 24, fig. 3_.\r\nOther bodies of this class occur in the flint, and present interesting\r\nexamples of the zoophytes of the chalk ocean.\r\n\r\nBut many of the Isle of Wight pebbles exhibit no traces of animal\r\nstructure, yet are valuable and instructive as mineralogical specimens:\r\nsuch are the clear and transparent pebbles with bands and veins of\r\nquartz and chalcedony. Some specimens are as pellucid as rock-crystal;\r\nothers are of a bright yellow, amber, dark-brown, and bluish-black\r\ncolour, and are often mottled with dendritical or arborescent\r\nmanganese. (_Plate IV._) The moss agates, as they are called by the\r\nlapidaries, are silicified sponges. Small pebbles of pure transparent\r\nrock-crystal are often found among the shingle in Compton and Sandown\r\nbays, and have probably been washed out of the wealden strata; for\r\nsimilar stones occur in the Tilgate grit, and at Tunbridge Wells: in\r\nthe latter place, they are cut and polished for rings, brooches, &c.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Plate IV._\r\n\r\n_Polished sections of Pebbles._\r\n\r\n_Page 86._]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: ZOOPHYTES OF THE CHALK.]\r\n\r\nOn the shores of the Isle of Wight, pebbles of jasper, resembling those\r\nfrom Egypt, and of banded quartz, with arborescent markings, or with\r\nzones of rich brown, are also met with; these do not appear to have\r\noriginated from the chalk strata.\r\n\r\nPebbles of silicified wood have been collected in Sandown bay by Mr.\r\nFowlstone; and water-worn boulders and pebbles of petrified wood,\r\nbones, &c., are common in Brook bay; rolled masses of the fresh-water\r\nshelly limestones (Sussex and Purbeck marbles) are also abundant in the\r\nsame localities.[AO]\r\n\r\n[AO] All these varieties may be obtained of Mr. Fowlstone, 4, Victoria\r\nArcade, Ryde.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNote VIII. Page 45. _Zoophytes of the Chalk._\r\n\r\n\r\nZoophytes, especially sponges, occur in such prodigious numbers in some\r\nof the chalk strata, that the nucleus of almost every flint nodule is\r\nan organic body. In many instances the silex has completely permeated\r\nthe animal substance, as in the pebbles before described; but sometimes\r\nthe sponge is a white calcareous mass, occupying a hollow in the flint:\r\na branched specimen of this kind, exposed on breaking a small nodule,\r\nis represented at _Lign. 24, fig. 2_.\r\n\r\nIn describing sponge as an animal substance, it may be necessary to\r\nexplain that the sponge in ordinary use is the flexible skeleton of\r\na living zoophyte, and was originally invested with a gelatinous or\r\nslimy matter, which lined all the pores and channels. When alive in\r\nthe water, currents constantly enter the outer pores, traverse all\r\nthe internal inosculating canals, and issue from the larger orifices\r\nwhich often project above the surface in perforated papillæ. By\r\nthe circulation of the sea-water through the porous structure, the\r\nnutrition of the animated mass is effected; and the modifications\r\nobservable in the number, size, form, and arrangement of the pores,\r\ncanals, and apertures, in the different kinds of this type of\r\norganization, are subservient to this especial function.\r\n\r\nBut associated with the true _Poriferæ_ or sponges, are numerous\r\nzoophytes which resemble them in form, but are of an entirely distinct\r\nnature; for they are the fossilized remains of _Polyparia_, that is, of\r\nthe frame-work of an aggregation of polypes, each individual of which\r\nhad an independent existence, although the whole were united by one\r\ncommon living integument, like the _Alcyonium_, or dead-men's fingers,\r\nof our coasts.[AP]\r\n\r\n[AP] See '_Medals of Creation_,' p. 251.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lign. 25:--Flints deriving their forms from the\r\nzoophytes they enclose.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: FUNGIFORM FLINTS.]\r\n\r\nAmong the flints whose forms depend on the organic bodies they enclose,\r\nare some which bear so close a resemblance in shape to _Fungi_, that\r\nthey are provincially called in Sussex \"_petrified mushrooms_;\" several\r\nof them are figured above (_Lign. 25_). In these fossils there are\r\nopenings at the base, and a groove on the margin of the upper part, in\r\nwhich the structure of the enclosed body is generally more or less\r\ndistinctly seen; and upon breaking one of these bodies, a section of\r\na funnel-shaped zoophyte is obtained. The origin of these flints will\r\nbe understood by reference to the four interesting specimens here\r\ndelineated, one-sixth of the natural size in linear dimensions.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lign. 26:--Ventriculites from the Chalk, Lewes.\r\n\r\n  1. A perfect specimen in Chalk, shewing the external net-like surface.\r\n\r\n  2. An expanded specimen, displaying the inner surface studded with cells.\r\n\r\n  3. A Ventriculite with the lower part enveloped in Flint.\r\n\r\n  4. Part of a Ventriculite; the base invested with Flint: the root-like\r\n       fibres are seen at a.\r\n\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: VENTRICULITES.]\r\n\r\nThis zoophyte, to which the name of _Ventriculite_ has been given to\r\ndenote its usual shape, was a hollow inverted cone, terminating at\r\nthe base in a point, whence radicles or root-like processes were sent\r\noff, by which the animal was firmly attached to the rock. The outer\r\nintegument was disposed in meshes like a net (see _Lign. 26, fig.\r\n1_), and the inner surface was beset with regular circular openings,\r\nthe orifices of tubular cells (_fig. 2_); each of which was probably\r\noccupied by a polype. The substance of the _Polyparium_, or general\r\nsupport of this family of animalcules, which alone occurs in a fossil\r\nstate, appears to have been analogous to that of the soft _Alcyonia_,\r\nand to have possessed a common irritability; the entire mass\r\ncontracting and expanding, as is the case in many recent zoophytes.[AQ]\r\n\r\n[AQ] See '_Wonders of Geology_,' 6th Ed., p. 610; '_Medals of\r\nCreation_,' p. 273-276; and '_Geological Excursions round the Isle of\r\nWight_,' pp. 179-184, for an account of the silicification of these and\r\nother Zoophytes.\r\n\r\nThe flints, _figs. 3, 7, 8, 9, Lign. 25_, were evidently formed\r\nin the manner exemplified in _fig. 3, Lign. 26_; _figs._ 2, 4, 6,\r\nare illustrated by _fig. 4, Lign. 26_; for the chalk specimens,\r\n_Lign. 26_, shew that all these flints have been moulded around\r\n_Ventriculites_, and that their diversity of figure has arisen from\r\nthe quantity of silex that happened to permeate the substance of the\r\nzoophyte; if but a small portion, flint like _figs._ 2 and 4, were\r\nthe result; if the quantity were considerable, the larger fungiform\r\nexamples were produced.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNote IX. Page 50. _Minute Corals from Chalk._\r\n\r\n\r\nSome layers of chalk are composed of an aggregation of many kinds of\r\ndelicate corals, the interstices being filled up with _Rotaliæ_ and\r\nother foraminiferous shells. In the cliffs near Dover there are several\r\nbeds of this nature, well known to collectors for the profusion of\r\nexquisite specimens they yield to the experienced investigator. _Lign.\r\n17_, p. 50, represents several varieties from different localities;\r\nthe small figures shew the natural size, and the enlarged ones their\r\nappearance when magnified. Attached to the surface of shells, and\r\nsometimes standing erect in crannies of flint nodules, beautiful corals\r\nmay often be detected by the aid of a lens of moderate power. By\r\nbrushing chalk in water, and examining the deposit, delicate fossils of\r\nthis kind may also be obtained.[AR]\r\n\r\n[AR] Refer to '_Medals of Creation_,' p. 284, and to '_Wonders of\r\nGeology_,' _Lecture VI._ p. 588, for a comprehensive view of Recent and\r\nFossil Corals.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: NATURE OF CORALS.]\r\n\r\nFrom the close analogy of the fossil corals to existing forms, it would\r\nnot be difficult to give restored figures of the originals. Every\r\nlittle branch might be represented fraught with living polypes: in some\r\ncells the agile inmates might be shown with the mouth expanded, and\r\nthe tentacula in rapid motion; in others withdrawn into their stony\r\nrecesses, and devouring the infinitesimal atoms that constitute their\r\nfood: even their varied hues might be introduced, and thus a vivid\r\npicture be presented of the microscopic beings which peopled the waters\r\nof the ancient chalk ocean.\r\n\r\nThat the Corals, which from their elegance and beauty are preserved in\r\nalmost every cabinet, have been fabricated--or, in other words, built\r\nup--by polypes, in the same manner as the honey-comb of the bee and\r\nwasp, is so prevalent yet erroneous an opinion, that I am induced to\r\npoint out its fallacy, by giving a brief account of the formation of\r\nthese substances. The three recent specimens represented in _Lign. 27_\r\nwill serve to illustrate my remarks.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lign. 27:--Recent Corals.\r\n\r\n  1. _Oculina ramea._\r\n\r\n  2. _Madrepora muricata._\r\n\r\n  3. _Isis hippuris._\r\n\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe coral, _fig. 1_, was an internal axis or skeleton, deposited by the\r\nsoft fleshy integument with which, when living, it was wholly invested;\r\nin the same manner as are the bones of animals, by the special membrane\r\n(_periosteum_) that secretes them. This integument lined every cell,\r\nand the polypes were permanently united to it. When the live coral is\r\ntaken out of the water, the animalcules shrink up and quickly perish;\r\ntheir soft parts and the external investing substance putrefy, and the\r\nstony axis beset with the radiated cells alone remains.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: RECENT CORALS.]\r\n\r\nIn the example of _Oculina ramea_, or May-blossom Coral, _fig. 1_, from\r\nthe Mediterranean, the cells are large and distinct; in the _Madrepore_\r\nfrom the West Indies, _fig. 2_, they are small and very closely\r\naggregated.\r\n\r\nThe specimen of _Isis_ (_fig. 3_) belongs to a group of coral-zoophytes\r\nin which the polype-cells consist of a substance that is durable, but\r\nnot so hard as coral, and invests an axis composed of a tough flexible\r\nmaterial, which is exposed at the base of _fig 3_, by the removal of\r\nthe external or cortical part in which the polypes were situated. The\r\n_Gorgonia_, or Venus's fan, has a similar structure and composition.[AS]\r\n\r\n[AS] See '_Wonders of Geology_,' vol. ii. p. 616.\r\n\r\nIn the _Red Coral_, so largely employed in the manufacture of beads,\r\nbrooches, and other ornaments, not only the animalcules, but also\r\ntheir receptacles, are composed of a soft perishable substance. When\r\nalive, the polypes, as well as the investing fleshy integument, are of\r\na delicate bluish tint; the internal calcareous axis alone possesses\r\nthe peculiar red colour. Upon being taken out of the sea, vitality\r\nquickly ceases, the soft parts decompose, and the beautiful crimson\r\nstone commonly known as the _true coral_, is obtained free from all\r\ntraces of the soft mass by which it was secreted. Although an actual\r\ninvestigation of the facts described can only be instituted near the\r\nseas of warm climates, yet our coasts abound in certain coral-zoophytes\r\nin which similar phenomena may readily be observed. Most persons in\r\ntheir rambles by the sea-side must have noticed on the fuci, algæ,\r\nshells, pebbles, &c., patches of a white earthy substance, which\r\nwhen closely examined resemble delicate lace-work. These apparently\r\ncalcareous incrustations are clusters of the zoophytes termed\r\nthe _Flustra_, or sea-mat.[AT] When removed from the water, this\r\naggregation of polypes seems coated over with a glossy film or varnish;\r\nand with a lens of moderate power the surface is seen to be full of\r\npores, disposed with much regularity. If viewed under the microscope\r\nwhile immersed in sea-water, a very different appearance is presented.\r\nEvery pore is found to be the opening of a cell whence issues a tube\r\nfringed with several long feelers or arms; these expand, then suddenly\r\ncontract and withdraw into the cell, and again issue forth; the whole\r\nsurface of the Flustra being covered with these hydra-like animalcules.\r\nThe Flustra, therefore, like the corals, constitutes an assemblage of\r\npolypes, each individual being permanently fixed in a durable cell,\r\nand the whole attached to a common integument by which the calcareous\r\nframe-work was secreted and maintained.[AU]\r\n\r\n[AT] See '_Wonders of Geology_,' Plate 5.\r\n\r\n[AU] See Dr. Johnson's beautiful work on '_British Zoophytes_,' in\r\nwhich are numerous figures of various species of Flustra.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNote X. Page 53. _Infusorial earth from Richmond in Virginia._\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: INFUSORIAL EARTHS.]\r\n\r\nThe greatest natural operations are produced by the most simple\r\nand apparently inadequate agents: for as the illustrious Galileo\r\nemphatically remarked, \"_La nature fait beaucoup avec peu, et ses\r\nopérations sont toutes également merveilleuses._\" The profound thinker\r\nHobbes, in the same spirit observes, \"The majesty of God appeareth no\r\nless in small things than in great, and as it exceedeth human sense in\r\nthe immensity of the universe, so also doth it in the smallness of the\r\nparts thereof.\" This sublime truth is strongly impressed on the mind\r\nof the geological inquirer, who perceives that whole countries and\r\nmountain ranges of great elevation and extent, are wholly composed of\r\nthe aggregated remains of beings of such infinite minuteness that but\r\nfor the powerful optical instruments of modern times, their presence\r\nwould never have been suspected.\r\n\r\nA few years only have elapsed since the sagacious Ehrenberg first\r\ndrew attention to this subject, and pointed out the proper method of\r\ninvestigation;[AV] and so rapid has been the progress of discovery in\r\nthis department of science, that _infusorial deposits_, as these beds\r\nof fossil animalcules are designated, have been detected in every\r\nquarter of the globe. A fact equally unexpected and remarkable has also\r\nbeen established, namely, that at the present moment similar minute\r\nliving agents are largely contributing to the increase of the solid\r\nmaterials of the crust of our planet.\r\n\r\n[AV] See '_Medals of Creation_,' p. 244, for instructions for the\r\nmicroscopical examination of earths, chalk, &c.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: RICHMOND EARTH.]\r\n\r\nThe infusorial earth of Virginia, alluded to in the text, is a\r\nyellowish siliceous clay, forming a deposit from twelve to fifteen\r\nfeet in thickness, upon which the towns of Richmond and Petersburgh\r\nare built. The surface of the country over which it extends is\r\ncharacterized by a scanty vegetation, owing to the siliceous nature of\r\nthe soil dependent on the minute organisms of which it almost entirely\r\nconsists. When a few grains of this earth are properly prepared for\r\nmicroscopic examination, immense numbers of the shields or cases of\r\nanimalcules are visible under a magnifying power of 300 diameters; in\r\nfact, the merest stain left by the evaporation of water in which some\r\nof the marl has been mixed, teems with these fossil remains.[AW]\r\n\r\n[AW] Specimens of Infusorial earths, prepared for the microscope, may\r\nbe obtained of Mr. Topping, 4, New Winchester Street, Pentonville Hill,\r\nNew Road, London.\r\n\r\nThese organisms are of exquisite structure, and comprise many\r\nspecies and genera. The most beautiful and abundant are the circular\r\nshields, termed _Coscinodisci_ (sieve-like disks), which are elegant\r\nsaucer-shaped cases, elaborately ornamented with hexagonal apertures\r\ndisposed in curves, somewhat resembling the engine-turned sculpturing\r\nof a watch; these shells are from 1/1000 to 1/100 of an inch in\r\ndiameter. A segment of one of these disks, highly magnified, is\r\nrepresented in _Lign. 18, fig. 2_. The body of the living animalcule\r\nwas protected and enclosed by a pair of these concave shells, the\r\nperforations admitting of the exsertion of filaments or tentacula.\r\nThis species of _Coscinodiscus_ abounds in the present seas, and\r\nconstitutes no inconsiderable proportion of the food of Pectens and\r\nother testaceous mollusca.[AX]\r\n\r\n[AX] See '_Thoughts on Animalcules_,' p. 103.\r\n\r\nAll the animalcules found in the Richmond earth are marine, and most\r\nof them belong to genera, and many to existing species; although the\r\nposition of the American strata proves that they are referable to a\r\nperiod of immense antiquity.\r\n\r\nIn Germany, beds of a white infusorial earth, resembling magnesia\r\nin appearance, and termed _Bergh-mehl_, or fossil farina, occur at\r\nBilin, and several other places: at San Fiora in Tuscany, near Egra\r\nin Bohemia, in the Bermudas, Barbadoes, &c., similar deposits have\r\nbeen discovered; all being composed of the shields of various kinds of\r\nanimalcules. But I must not extend these remarks, and will only add a\r\nfew observations on the infusorial earth of Barbadoes, which has but\r\nrecently been brought under the notice of geologists by Sir Robert\r\nSchomburgk, and is especially interesting for the exquisite beauty and\r\nvariety of its organisms, and the circumstances under which the deposit\r\noccurs.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: FOSSIL INFUSORIA OF BARBADOES.]\r\n\r\nBarbadoes, an island of the West Indies, is about twelve miles in\r\nlength from north to south, and consists of coral reefs, capped in one\r\ndistrict by tertiary sandstones and limestones, which attain a height\r\nof 1200 feet above the sea. Over the rest of the island, coral reefs\r\nform the entire surface, which is divided by vertical walls of coral,\r\nsome of them nearly 200 feet high, into six terraces, indicating as\r\nmany periods of upheaval. In the lowest reef, Indian hatchets have\r\nbeen found twenty feet above high water mark; shewing that the last\r\nmovement, at least, took place within the human period. The tertiary\r\nstrata are more or less inclined, and in many places vertical, and\r\ncontorted. Strata of marl, several hundred feet thick, predominate; and\r\nthere are beds of bituminous coal, sandstone, clays, and ferruginous\r\nsands. Arenaceous limestone containing teeth of sharks, spines of\r\nechini, and shells, forms the summit of a hill nearly 1,000 feet high.\r\nThe white marls abound in 300 species of the most beautiful siliceous\r\ninfusoria; many are peculiar, others the same as occur in the Richmond\r\nearth, and some belong to recent species.[AY]\r\n\r\n[AY] Sir R.
