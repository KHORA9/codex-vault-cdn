A person can slaughter his animals outside such a\r\nfacility only for use by him, members of his household, his nonpaying\r\nguests and employees. He is not allowed to sell any portion of the\r\ncarcass.

The most important considerations are health, care\r\nof the animal prior to slaughter, kind of animal (lamb or mutton), and\r\nexpected meat yield.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                Health\r\n\r\nOne should take care that an unhealthy animal is not selected for\r\nslaughter. At the time of selection, look for signs of sickness such\r\nas fever, increased breathing rate and diarrhea. Animals suspected of\r\nbeing unhealthy should be treated by a veterinarian until the animal\r\nis returned to a healthy state.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             Animal Care\r\n\r\nTo obtain high-quality meat, it is important to exercise proper care\r\nof the animal prior to slaughter. Pen the animal in a clean, dry place\r\nthe day before slaughtering. Restrict the animal from feed 24 hours\r\nprior to slaughter, but provide access to water at all times.\r\nWithholding feed results in greater ease of evisceration (because the\r\ngastrointestinal tract is smaller) and minimizes the migration of\r\ningested bacteria from the gastrointestinal tract into the blood\r\nstream. Access to water enhances complete bleeding, results in\r\nbrighter colored lean in the carcass, and enhances pelt removal.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      Animal Type and Meat Yield\r\n\r\nAnimal age will have a sufficient effect on the palatability of the\r\ncooked product. Carcasses from sheep are classed as lamb (12 to 14\r\nmonths or less), yearling mutton (14 to 24 months), or mutton (over 2\r\nyears) on the basis of differences that occur in the development of\r\ntheir muscular and skeletal systems. Differences in palatability\r\nbetween the lamb and mutton meat are substantial. Meat from mutton\r\ncarcasses has a very intense flavor which is undesirable to some\r\nindividuals. Mutton is seldom marketed as retail cuts but rather as\r\nsoup stock or in further processed meat items.\r\n\r\nA meat-type lamb carcass, when cut and trimmed according to the\r\nmethods described later, will yield over 70 percent of its carcass\r\nweight in major trimmed cuts. Expected yields of retail cuts from a\r\nyield grade 2 (trim) and a yield grade 4 (wasty) carcass are presented\r\nin table 1.\r\n\r\n       _TABLE 1—Comparison of yield of retail cuts between USDA\r\n               yield 2 and yield grade 4 lamb carcasses_\r\n  ------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n                                     Percentage of carcass weight\r\n\r\n  Closely trimmed                 ---------------------------------\r\n  retail cuts                       Yield grade 2    Yield grade 4\r\n  ------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n  Leg, short cut....................     22.2             19.4\r\n  Sirloin...........................      6.4              5.8\r\n  Short loin........................     10.1              9.5\r\n  Rack..............................      7.9              7.5\r\n  Shoulder..........................     23.8             21.6\r\n  Neck..............................      2.1              1.9\r\n  Breast............................      9.8              9.8\r\n  Foreshank.........................      3.4              3.2\r\n  Flank (boneless stew).............      2.3              2.3\r\n  Kidney............................      0.5              0.5\r\n  Fat...............................      8.2             15.4\r\n  Bone..............................      3.3              3.1\r\n                                  ---------------------------------\r\n      Total.........................    100.0            100.0\r\n  ------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n    Adapted from Smith, King, and Carpenter, 1975.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                      PREPARING FOR SLAUGHTER\r\n\r\nPrior to the day of slaughter, select the slaughter site, accumulate\r\nall equipment, prepare for waste disposal, and, if necessary, make\r\narrangements with a local processor or meat market for chilling and\r\ncutting the carcass. If you plan to have the carcass chilled and cut\r\nup, arrangements should be made concerning the time and day on which\r\nthe carcass can be accepted, the charges and specific instructions for\r\nchilling, cutting, wrapping, and freezing the carcass.\r\n\r\n                           Site Selection\r\n\r\nSelection of the slaughter site is extremely important. A site with\r\nclean running water is best. If a tree is to be used, a healthy limb,\r\n6 to 8 inches in diameter, which is 8 to 10 feet from the ground is\r\nneeded. This will ensure that the limb will not break from the weight\r\nof the carcass and the carcass can be fully extended from the ground\r\nfor pelting and viscera removal. If slaughter is to be done in a barn,\r\nbe sure that a strong beam 8 to 10 feet from the floor is available.\r\nThe floor should be clean, and preferably, concrete.\r\n\r\nAfter selection of the slaughter site, clean up the area to ensure\r\nthat leaves and dirt are not blown on the carcass during slaughter. If\r\nthe site has a wooden or concrete floor, wash the floor and all\r\nequipment with plenty of soap and water. Be sure to rinse thoroughly\r\nbecause sanitizers discolor the meat and may cause off flavors. If\r\nslaughtering is to be done outdoors, use straw to cover the area where\r\nthe carcass will be pelted and eviscerated.\r\n\r\nThe weather on the day of slaughter should also be considered. During\r\nhot weather, slaughter is best performed during the early morning or\r\nlate evening hours. Since an inexperienced person will take 1 to 2\r\nhours to complete the slaughter operation, care should be taken to\r\npreclude long exposure to high temperatures. During cold weather of\r\nless than 35° F, slaughter can be done at any time, since spoilage\r\nbacteria do not grow as rapidly in a cold environment. Slaughter\r\nduring high winds will result in dirt and other contaminants being\r\nblown onto the carcass.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           Waste Disposal\r\n\r\nAll waste products should be disposed of in a sanitary manner. If the\r\nwork is to be done in the open, one should select a site with good\r\ndrainage so that blood and water can drain away from the carcass.\r\nBlood and water must not be allowed to pollute nearby streams or other\r\nwater supplies.\r\n\r\nDisposal of viscera is often a problem. Arrangements should be made to\r\nhave a local processor or rendering plant pick it up. If this is not\r\npossible, it should be buried so that dogs and other animals cannot\r\ndig it up.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         Slaughter Equipment\r\n\r\nElaborate and expensive equipment is not necessary, but certain items\r\nare essential (fig. 1). The following slaughter equipment is\r\nrecommended:\r\n\r\n  1. .22-caliber rifle or pistol with long or long rifle cartridges.\r\n  2. Sharp boning knife and steel.\r\n  3. Block and tackle or strong rope.\r\n  4. Oil or water stone.\r\n  5. Ample clean water for washing hands, carcass, and by products.\r\n  6. Tree with strong limb, beam, or tripod 8 to 10 feet high.\r\n  7. Buckets (two or three).\r\n  8. Ice or cold water.\r\n  9. Straw for placing under animal during pelting and evisceration.\r\n  10. Clean cloths or plastic for protection of meat during transport.\r\n  11. Clean string.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Rifle, knives, meat saw, scrapers, gambrel, hook]\r\n  Figure 1.—Equipment for slaughter.\r\n\r\nBe sure that all equipment which will come in contact with meat is\r\nthoroughly cleaned. Most people get blood and other material on their\r\nouter garments during slaughter, which should not be transferred to\r\nthe carcass after it is washed. If weather permits, wear short sleeve\r\nshirts and wash arms and hands frequently to prevent contamination.\r\n\r\nAdditional equipment needed for cutting the carcass is discussed in\r\nthe section on carcass cutting.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              SLAUGHTER\r\n\r\n                              Stunning\r\n\r\nThe animal should be properly secured to a tree or strong post and\r\nkilled as quickly and humanely as possible. Stun the animal with a\r\nwell directed bullet (.22 caliber rifle or pistol) in the forehead,\r\nmidway between and slightly above the eyes (fig. 2). Make the first\r\nshot count since a careless shot can cause the animal much pain or\r\ninjure helpers. As with the use of any firearms, normal precautions\r\nshould be taken when stunning the animal.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Rifle muzzle pointed at forehead of sheep]\r\n  Figure 2.—Stunning.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              Bleeding\r\n\r\nBleeding should be done as quickly as possible after the animal is\r\ndown, using a straight boning knife and holding the animal in position\r\nwith the knee on or behind the shoulder. Grasp the lower jaw with the\r\nleft hand, pull the head back and insert the knife just back of the\r\njaw where the angle is made (fig. 3). With the cutting edge to the\r\noutside, insert the knife as close to the neck bone as possible. Cut\r\nclear through and then outward, severing the windpipe, gullet and\r\nblood vessels (fig. 4).\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Man inserting knife near the jaw of the sheep]\r\n  Figure 3.—Bleeding.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Man finishing the cut of the sheep’s neck]\r\n  Figure 4.—Bleeding.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            Pelt Removal\r\n\r\nHands and equipment must be kept clean in order to produce a clean\r\ncarcass. Dirt and wool on the carcass are very difficult to remove and\r\nusually have to be trimmed. Make certain there is a good supply of\r\nclean water available at all times. Also, pelting (fisting) is much\r\neasier if the hands are kept slightly wet.\r\n\r\n_Legs, Breast and Midline_.—The pelt can be opened around the legs and\r\nalong the midline and breast from the horizontal or suspended\r\nposition. The procedure selected depends on personal preference and\r\nthe equipment available.\r\n\r\n_Horizontal method_.—Place the animal on its back on a clean floor\r\n(concrete, slate, or piece of plywood) (fig. 5). Standing to one side\r\nof the lamb, hold one front leg between your knees and allow the lamb\r\nto lean away. Remove a narrow strip of skin down the front of the\r\nforeleg, being sure to remove the skin over the knee (fig. 6). Turn\r\nthe knife (with the cutting edge toward the skin) and make an opening\r\nto the neck in front of the breast (fig. 7). Make certain to cut\r\ntoward the skin to avoid cutting through the thin membrane (fell)\r\ncovering the outside of the carcass. If this membrane is broken, the\r\nlean muscles will bulge through and give the carcass an unattractive\r\nappearance.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Sheep lying supine on a plywood sheet]\r\n  Figure 5.—Horizontal position.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Man cutting pelt off front leg using a knife]\r\n  Figure 6.—Skinning foreleg.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Man cutting pelt up leg to breast using a knife]\r\n  Figure 7.—Skinning neck.\r\n\r\nSkin the opposite leg the same way, meeting the cut made in front of\r\nthe breast. Open the pelt down the neck to the opening made by\r\nsticking (fig. 8). This will form a V-shaped strip of pelt over the\r\nbreast. Remove the pelt over the breast by pulling the pelt up and\r\nback. Once started, it is best to complete by fisting. Push the fist\r\nunder the pelt with the knuckles next to the carcass and the thumb\r\nover the first finger (fig. 9). Press the fist up against the skin\r\nworking it away from the carcass. Work slowly and avoid tearing\r\nthrough the fell and muscles. After the pelt is loosened over the\r\nbrisket (fig. 10), stop and skin out the rear legs.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Man using knife to skin up to neck]\r\n  Figure 8.—Skinning neck.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Man pulling up on pelt on breast]\r\n  Figure 9.—Fisting brisket.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Man pulling up on pelt, peeling it back away from head]\r\n  Figure 10.—Fisting brisket.\r\n\r\nStretching the rear legs, remove a strip of skin down the back of the\r\nleg and over the hock (fig. 11). With the leg still between your\r\nknees, turn the knife outward and open the skin from the hock to a\r\npoint in front of the anus (fig. 12). Skin around the hock and down\r\nthe shank. Remove the foot at the last joint (the one next to the\r\nhoof). See fig. 13. Follow the same procedure on the other leg and\r\nthen fist the pelt off the inside of the legs and over the crotch\r\n(fig. 14).\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Man cutting pelt off hindleg using a knife]\r\n  Figure 11.—Skinning hindleg.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Man cutting up leg to anus using a knife]\r\n  Figure 12.—Cutting to midline.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Man cutting off foot using a knife]\r\n  Figure 13.—Removing foot.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Pelt partially removed]\r\n  Figure 14.—Fisting over inside of legs.\r\n\r\nFrom the breast, fist down the belly and around the navel to the\r\nopening at the crotch (fig. 15). The carcass is now ready to be hung.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Man pushing hand down between pelt and carcass]\r\n  Figure 15.—Fisting down belly.\r\n\r\nTie a heavy cord around the hindlegs, and suspend the carcass. The\r\npoint of hanging should be approximately seven feet from the ground to\r\nprovide a good working height.\r\n\r\n_Suspended method_.—Tie a heavy string around one of the rear legs and\r\nsuspend the carcass (fig. 16). On the leg not suspended, remove a\r\nstrip of skin over the hock and past the dew-claws (fig. 17). Turn the\r\nknife outward and open the skin from the hock to a point in front of\r\nthe anus. Skin around the hock and down the shank (fig. 18). Remove the\r\nfoot at the last joint.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Sheep hung up by one rear leg]\r\n  Figure 16.—Suspended carcass.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Man slicing pelt away from lower hindleg near hoof]\r\n  Figure 17.—Skinning hindleg.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Man slicing pelt away from upper hindleg]\r\n  Figure 18.—Skinning hindleg.\r\n\r\nRemove a strip of skin along the suspended leg and cut the skin from\r\nthe hock towards the anus, connecting with the cut from the other leg\r\n(fig. 19). Remove the skin around the shank. Fist along the cut\r\nbetween the legs, removing the pelt around the back of the legs, in\r\nthe crotch and around the front of the legs. Suspend the carcass by\r\nthe opposite leg and remove the foot on the loosened leg. Tie a heavy\r\ncord around both rear legs and suspend the carcass (fig. 20).\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Sheep hung up by one rear leg]\r\n  Figure 19.—Skinning hindleg.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Sheep hung up by both rear legs using a single rope]\r\n  Figure 20.—Both legs tied.\r\n\r\nRemove a strip of skin along the back of the front legs from the knee\r\nto the foot (fig. 21). Make a split in the pelt beginning at each knee\r\nand connecting at the neck in front of the breast. Open the pelt down\r\nthe neck to the opening made by sticking (fig. 22).\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Man slicing across front leg just above the hoof]\r\n  Figure 21.—Skinning foreleg.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Man slicing pelt away from breast using a knife]\r\n  Figure 22.—Opening pelt to neck.\r\n\r\nRemove the pelt over the breast by pulling the pelt up and back (fig.\r\n23). Once started, it is best to complete by fisting. Fist along the\r\nbelly and around the flanks, meeting the opening made at the rear legs\r\n(fig. 24).\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Man sliding hand between pelt and chest]\r\n  Figure 23.—Fisting brisket.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Man sliding hand between pelt and belly]\r\n  Figure 24.—Fisting belly.\r\n\r\n_Sides and back_.—Open the pelt down the midline of the belly and\r\nloosen the navel. Hold the pelt tight with one hand and fist off the\r\nsides, work around to the back, and up around the hindlegs (fig. 25).\r\nIf the fell is broken try to work around the break to get a new start.\r\nFist down past the shoulder, around the sides and up over the rump.\r\nFrom underneath the hock, push up until the pelt hangs by the skin\r\nthat is fastened to the tail and anus (fig. 26). It will be necessary\r\nto use a knife to remove the pelt around the tail (fig. 27). Carefully\r\nskin around the tail and allow the pelt to drop (fig. 28).\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Man sliding hand between pelt and sides]\r\n  Figure 25.—Fisting side and back.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Man pulling pelt up and away from back]\r\n  Figure 26.—Pulling pelt up.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Man slicing pelt around tail using a knife]\r\n  Figure 27.—Skinning around tail.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Pelt laying on ground at head of suspended animal]\r\n  Figure 28.—Let pelt drop.\r\n\r\nThe front feet can be removed by cutting through the joint at the knee\r\n(fig. 29) or by breaking them at the “break” or “spool” joints. To\r\nbreak the legs at the “break” or “spool” joint, cut across the tendon\r\nbetween the knee and foot (fig. 30), grasp the foot in one hand, the\r\nleg in the other, and break back and sideways. On young lambs the\r\n“break” joint will snap easily and the foot can be removed. On older\r\nlambs, it will be necessary to cut across the pastern joint and twist\r\nthe toes off. This joint is called the “spool” joint (fig. 31). Wash\r\nthe carcass thoroughly before eviscerating. Remove the head at the\r\njoint closest to the head (fig. 32).\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Man slicing through front knee joint using a knife]\r\n  Figure 29.—Removing foreleg.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Man slicing off front foot using a knife]\r\n  Figure 30.—Removing front foot at spool joint.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Sliced spool joint]\r\n  Figure 31.—Spool joint.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Man slicing through neck using a knife]\r\n  Figure 32.—Removing head.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            Evisceration\r\n\r\nLoosen the large intestine by cutting around the rectum deep into\r\nthe pelvic canal (fig. 33). Pull the rectum outward cutting any\r\nremaining attachments. Tie a piece of string around the large\r\nintestine near its opening and let it drop into the pelvic cavity\r\n(fig. 34). In lamb or mutton the pelvic bone is not separated.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Man using knife around anus]\r\n  Figure 33.—Loosening anus.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Man tying shut anus]\r\n  Figure 34.—Tying anus.\r\n\r\nLocate the end of the sternum (fig. 35) and split the breastbone with\r\na knife or saw (fig. 36). Do not cut into the body cavity. Make a cut\r\nthrough the cod or udder into the pelvic cavity. Make this opening\r\nlarge enough to insert the hand. Insert the knife handle inside the\r\nbody cavity and with the blade extended outward, open the body cavity\r\nto the opening made at the brisket (fig. 37). Allow the paunch and\r\nintestines to roll out and hang. Do not allow them to fall as the\r\nesophagus will tear and spill its contents onto the carcass. Find the\r\nloosened large intestine, and pull it down past the kidneys, leaving\r\nthe kidneys intact (fig. 38). Remove the liver by reaching behind and\r\npulling it while cutting the connective tissue (fig. 39). Examine it\r\nfor any abscesses (yellow or white pus) or scar tissue. Remove the\r\ngall bladder from the liver by cutting beneath it and pulling (fig.\r\n40).

Usually, a meat inspector or graduate\r\nveterinarian is the only person qualified to do this, but under farm\r\nconditions it becomes necessary for you to look for the obvious signs\r\nof disease or damage. If any part of the viscera or carcass is\r\nquestionable, you should obtain expert advice.\r\n\r\nBruises, minor injuries, parasites in the organs, and enclosed\r\nabscesses, and single tumors are frequently local conditions that can\r\nbe easily removed. However, the presence of congestion or inflammation\r\nof the lungs, intestines, kidneys, inner surface of chest or abdominal\r\ncavity and numerous yellowish or pearl-like growths scattered\r\nthroughout the organs should be viewed seriously. Carcasses and\r\nviscera having such abnormalities should be examined by a graduate\r\nveterinarian and his opinion obtained as to the wholesomeness of the\r\nmeat. You should check with a cooperating veterinarian before\r\nslaughtering the animal to be certain he will be available if you\r\nshould seek his advice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                        CHILLING THE CARCASS\r\n\r\nFollowing evisceration, the lamb carcass should be carefully trimmed\r\nand any pieces of adhering skin, wool, bruises, hair, or manure\r\nremoved. Lamb carcasses are not split longitudinally because they are\r\nnot thick enough in any dimension to create cooling problems.\r\n\r\nThe surfaces of freshly slaughtered lamb carcasses are contaminated\r\nwith bacteria that can spoil the meat unless their growth is promptly\r\nchecked. Bacterial growth can be slowed by prompt chilling and keeping\r\nthe carcass at low temperatures. If the weather is suitable (28° to\r\n35° F), the carcass can be wrapped in a sheet, hung and chilled in a\r\nwell ventilated shed. Wrapping with clean cloth will partially protect\r\nthe carcass from contamination.\r\n\r\n_Do not_ allow the carcass to freeze because freezing within one day\r\nafter death may toughen the meat. If the carcass cannot be chilled to\r\nbelow 40° F on the farm, it should be transported to the local locker\r\nplant or market for chilling. The need for prompt and thorough\r\nchilling of warm carcasses cannot be over-emphasized. The carcass can\r\nbe cut into retail cuts after the carcass has been chilled for 24 to\r\n48 hours.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CUTTING\r\n\r\nUse the following guidelines to determine cutting and packaging\r\ninstructions for the processor if the carcass is not cut and wrapped\r\non the farm.\r\n\r\n_Chops_.—Those from young animals can be broiled or pan fried and\r\nshould be at least ¾ to 1 inch thick. The loin and rib chops are\r\nrelatively small and it takes two or three to comprise a serving.\r\nThose from the sirloin and shoulder are larger and only one chop may\r\nsuffice. Allow ¾ of a pound bone-in per person (uncooked) as a guide.\r\n\r\n_Roasts_.—Allow ¾ pound per serving for bone-in roasts (leg,\r\nshoulder) and ½ pound per serving for boneless roast (bone and\r\nrolled shoulder).\r\n\r\n_Ground lamb and stew_.—Allow ½ pound per serving.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      Carcass Cutting Equipment\r\n\r\nElaborate and expensive equipment is not necessary, but certain items\r\nare essential. The following equipment is recommended:\r\n\r\n  1. Steel.\r\n  2. Boning knife.\r\n  3. Meat saw.\r\n  4. Freezer paper (see section on “wrapping”).\r\n  5. Freezer tape.\r\n  6. Meat grinder (electric or hand powered).\r\n\r\n\r\n                         Cutting the Carcass\r\n\r\nBegin cutting the lamb carcass by removing the thin cuts—the breast,\r\nflank, and foreleg. Lay the carcass on its side and mark a cutting\r\nline from the elbow joint of the foreleg to the front part of the\r\nhindleg. Most of the flank can be removed by starting the cut between\r\nthe legs at the cod or udder fat where the flank begins. Figure 44\r\nshows this cut made in a straight line from the front of the hindleg\r\nto the elbow joint. More of the rear flank and lower ribs can be\r\nremoved by making the cut higher, near the hindleg. However, the cut\r\nacross the lower shoulder should be as close to the joint on the\r\nforeleg as possible to leave the shoulder roast large.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Man sawing off flank]\r\n  Figure 44.—Steamling.\r\n\r\nAfter removing the thin cuts from both sides, remove the kidneys,\r\nkidney fat, and diaphragm (fig. 45), if not removed at slaughter. Turn\r\nthe carcass over on to the cut surfaces and remove the neck. Cross\r\nsectional cuts make neck chops, which should be braised; or the neck\r\nmay be cut off flush with the top of the shoulder and added to stew or\r\nground lamb (figs. 46 and 47).\r\n\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Kidneys with fat attached lying next to carcass]\r\n  Figure 45.—Kidney and kidney fat.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Man sawing through neck]\r\n  Figure 46.—Neck chops or slices.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Neck chops lying next to carcass]\r\n  Figure 47.—Neck chops or slices.\r\n\r\nThe trimmed carcass is separated into four primal cuts, each with\r\ndifferent characteristics (figs. 48 and 49). A cut between the fifth\r\nand sixth ribs removes the shoulder. Another cut between the 12th and\r\n13th (last) rib separates the rib from the loin (the 13th rib remains\r\nin the loin). The loin and legs are separated just in front of the\r\nhipbones by cutting through the small of the back where the curve of\r\nthe leg muscles blend into the loin. This is the cut being made in\r\n  Figure 48.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Man making third saw cut across carcass]\r\n  Figure 48.—Preparing four primal cuts.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Carcass cut into four pieces]\r\n  Figure 49.—Preparing four primal cuts.\r\n\r\nSplit the legs through the center of the backbone (fig. 50). Trim the\r\nflank and cod or udder fat off (fig. 51). Remove the backbone from the\r\nleg by making a saw cut approximately parallel to the split surface of\r\nthe backbone and 1 inch below this surface (fig. 52). Saw\r\napproximately 1 inch deep, or until you feel a slight slippage when\r\nyou cut through part of the hipbone.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Hind quarter split using saw]\r\n  Figure 50.—Splitting legs.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Leg of lamb and trimmed pieces displayed]\r\n  Figure 51.—Leg of lamb.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Saw separating backbone from leg of lamb]\r\n  Figure 52.—Backbone removal.\r\n\r\nBe careful not to saw all the way through the hipbone. Insert a knife\r\ninto the saw cut, find the “slip” joint between the bones and cut\r\nunderneath the backbone to complete its removal (fig. 53). Cut off the\r\nlower shank bones by sawing where the tendon enters the muscle (fig.\r\n54).\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Knife slicing off backbone using a knife]\r\n  Figure 53.—Backbone removal.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Saw cutting off lower leg]\r\n  Figure 54.—Removing lower shank.\r\n\r\nThe leg may be further trimmed by cutting through the knee or “stifle”\r\njoint to remove the shank. This joint is located about halfway between\r\nwhere the muscles of the shank end and the muscles of the lower leg\r\nbegin. Cut into the tissues over the bones until you locate the joint\r\nand work the knife through it (fig. 55). Continue cutting straight\r\nacross the heel of the leg.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Knife slicing through stifle joint using a knife]\r\n  Figure 55.—Stifle joint.\r\n\r\nSeveral sirloin chops may be removed by knife and saw cuts made\r\nparallel to the cut separating the leg from the loin (fig. 56).\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Saw cutting off chops]\r\n  Figure 56.—Sirloin chops.\r\n\r\nSplit the loin through the center of the backbone and remove the flank\r\nabout 1 inch from the loin “eye” (figs. 57 and 58).\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Saw cutting loin in half along backbone]\r\n  Figure 57.—Splitting loin.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Saw cutting off flank edge]\r\n  Figure 58.—Removing flank edge.\r\n\r\nLoin chops are made by cutting perpendicular to the backbone (fig.\r\n59). Usually chops are cut ¾ of an inch to an inch thick. Doubles or\r\n“English” loin chops are made from a loin which has not been split\r\n(fig. 60). The flank portion may be ground or made into stew.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Saw cutting across loin]\r\n  Figure 59.—Preparing loin chops.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Loin chops displayed]\r\n  Figure 60.—Loin chops.\r\n\r\nRemove the fell membrane from each sirloin, loin, and rib chop before\r\ncooking; the fell becomes hard in frying. When the chop is cold the\r\nfell peels off easily; start peeling at the lower end of the chop\r\n(fig. 61).\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Man pulling membrane away from chop]\r\n  Figure 61.—Removing fell membrane.\r\n\r\nLeave the fell on the leg and shoulder roasts to lessen the\r\nevaporation of meat juices. Clean fell on roasts, chops, or stews will\r\nnot affect flavor.\r\n\r\nThe rib should be split somewhat differently than the other primal\r\ncuts (figs. 62 and 63). The backbone is not split but is removed by\r\ncutting through the ribs along the ridge where they join the backbone.\r\nContinue cutting close to the backbone to separate one rib section.\r\nRepeat this cut along the opposite side of the backbone to separate it\r\nfrom the other rib section. Remove the breast portion by cutting\r\napproximately 2 inches from the rib “eye” (fig. 64).\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Saw cutting through ribs at backbone using a knife]\r\n  Figure 62.—Splitting rib.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Saw cutting through ribs at backbone]\r\n  Figure 63.—Splitting rib.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Knife slicing through ribs]\r\n  Figure 64.—Separating breast from rib.\r\n\r\nRib chops are easily made by cutting between the ribs (fig. 65).\r\nRemove the fell before cooking. The breast portion may be barbecued in\r\none piece or made into riblets by cutting between the ribs (fig. 66).\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Knife slicing rib chops of rib rack]\r\n  Figure 65.—Preparing rib chops.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Rib chops and breast displayed]\r\n  Figure 66.—Rib chops and breast.\r\n\r\nAfter splitting, the shoulder may be roasted as is, made into chops,\r\nor boned and rolled to make a more easily carved roast (figs. 67 and\r\n68).\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Saw cutting through shoulder]\r\n  Figure 67.—Splitting shoulder.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Chops and roasts displayed]\r\n  Figure 68.—Shoulder chops and roasts.\r\n\r\nArm chops should be made first by cutting parallel to the surface made\r\nwhen the foreleg and breast were removed. Only two or three arm chops\r\nshould be made (fig. 69). Blade chops are made by cutting between the\r\nribs and sawing through the blade and backbone.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Saw cutting through shoulder]\r\n  Figure 69.—Preparing arm chops.\r\n\r\nTo prepare a boneless shoulder, first remove the ribs and backbone by\r\ncutting closely underneath the ribs following their curvature; then\r\ncutting along and over the backbone and neck vertebrae to remove them\r\n(fig. 70). Start at the rear surface and cut along the lower edge of\r\nthe blade bone to lift the underlying muscles exposing the blade bone\r\nand arm bone (fig. 71). Cut along the edges of these bones and then\r\nlift the over-lying meat and cut close to the top surface of these\r\nbones to remove them (fig. 72). The blade bone has a ridge which runs\r\nclose to and nearly parallel to its shorter edge. Try not to cut\r\nthrough the skin surface when cutting over this ridge. The boneless\r\nmeat should be rolled so that the shoulder “eye” is lengthwise in the\r\nroast. The shoulder “eye” is located under the flat surface of the\r\nshoulder blade. Roll the meat as tightly as possible, then tie\r\nsecurely with strong twine or cord (fig. 68). The boneless shoulder\r\nmay be made into a pocket roast and stuffed with ground lamb or other\r\ndressing. The edges of the meat are laced together after stuffing.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Knife slicing off ribs on shoulder]\r\n  Figure 70.—Boning shoulder.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Knife exposing blade bone]\r\n  Figure 71.—Boning shoulder.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Display of boneless shoulder and removed bones]\r\n  Figure 72.—Boned shoulder.\r\n\r\nThe lower shank bones of the foreleg are removed by cutting or sawing\r\nthrough the joint. The foreleg and hind shank are often barbecued, cut\r\ninto stew, or boned, and the meat ground.\r\n\r\nThe breast can be cut into stew, boned and rolled, ground, or made\r\ninto a pocket roast by cutting under and close to the ribs to form a\r\npocket which can be stuffed. The edges are then laced together (fig.\r\n73).\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Display of breast and foreshank]\r\n  Figure 73.—Breast and foreshank.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              Wrapping\r\n\r\nImmediately after chilling and cutting, meat _must be_ properly\r\nwrapped, quickly frozen, and stored at 0° F or lower until needed.\r\nProper wrapping is essential to maintain meat quality; therefore, one\r\nshould:\r\n\r\n  • Use moisture-vapor proof wrap such as heavily waxed freezer\r\n    paper or specifically laminated paper.\r\n\r\n  • Prepare convenient family-sized packages.\r\n\r\n  • Wrap meat closely, eliminating as much air as possible.\r\n\r\n  • Improper wrapping will allow air to enter and result in “freezer\r\n    burn” and rancidity.\r\n\r\n  • Use a proper wrapping procedure (fig. 74).\r\n\r\n  • Label and date each package properly.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Drawing showing 5 steps to wrapping meat]\r\n  Figure 74.—Wrapping procedure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                     FREEZING AND FROZEN STORAGE\r\n\r\nWhen freezing large quantities of meat, it is best to use a commercial\r\nestablishment for fast freezing. Since a lamb carcass will yield only\r\n70 to 75 percent usable retail cuts or about 38 pounds from a 50 pound\r\nlamb carcass, the home freezer will adequately handle this amount.\r\nWhen using the home freezer be sure to:\r\n\r\n  • Clean and defrost freezer.\r\n\r\n  • Freeze meat at -10° or lower.\r\n\r\n  • Freeze only the amount of meat that will freeze in 24 hours.\r\n\r\n  • Allow ample air circulation by not overpacking the freezer.\r\n\r\n  • In the freezer maintain 0° F or less for storage.\r\n\r\nRemember, proper wrapping and freezing does not improve quality but\r\nmaintains original quality. It is safe to refreeze meat that has been\r\nkept below 40° F during thawing. However, refreezing is not usually\r\nrecommended because there is some loss of meat quality.\r\n\r\nLamb cuts should be utilized within 6 to 9 months after freezing;\r\nground and stew lamb within 3 to 4 months. Longer storage results in\r\nlowered quality.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            MEAT COOKERY\r\n\r\nTender cuts of meat are best cooked with dry heat such as broiling,\r\nroasting, and panbroiling. Less tender cuts of meat are tenderized by\r\ncooking with _moist_ heat. Connective tissue is softened and\r\ntenderized by cooking slowly in moisture.\r\n\r\nTemperature control is very important in meat cookery. Meat loses\r\nmoisture, fat, and other volatile substances during cooking. However,\r\nsome of the meat juices and fat may be retained in the pan drippings.\r\n\r\nCooking losses can be controlled by controlling the oven cooking\r\ntemperature and final internal temperature of the meat. Shrinkage is\r\nincreased when hot oven temperatures are used for cooking and when the\r\nmeat is cooked to a higher internal temperature.\r\n\r\nThe meat thermometer is the most accurate guide to the degree of\r\ndoneness of meat. Cooking time can be used as a guide to the degree of\r\ndoneness, but this may be influenced by fat and moisture content, and\r\nshape or size of the cut.\r\n\r\nFresh lamb is usually cooked to an internal temperature of 170 to 180° F\r\n(77 to 82° C). Chops or roasts from the leg, loin, back, or shoulder\r\nare suited to dry heat cookery methods such as broiling or roasting.\r\nOther cuts from the lamb carcass such as stew meat, neck slices, lamb\r\nriblets, and shank are best suited to moist cookery methods such as\r\nbraising. Lamb should be served hot and not allowed to cool before\r\nserving.\r\n\r\nMore detailed instructions for cooking procedures can be obtained from\r\nthe following sources:\r\n\r\n  USDA Beef Slaughtering Bulletin, FB 2209\r\n\r\n  USDA Lamb in Family Meals, HG 124\r\n\r\n  Lessons on Meat\r\n  National Live Stock and Meat\r\n  Board 36 South Wabash\r\n  Avenue, Chicago, 111. 60603\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                       PRESERVING LAMB PELTS\r\n\r\nSelect pelts for preserving which are free of numerous holes and which\r\nhave relatively clean fleece. The day the pelt is removed, wash the\r\nfleece thoroughly with cold water. High pressure water can be used if\r\nthe fleece is extremely dirty. Remove any large pieces of connective\r\ntissue or flesh adhering to the pelt. In a cool, dry shelter or\r\nbuilding, spread the pelt, wool down, on the floor and cover with an\r\neven layer of salt. A small amount of alum can be added to the salt.\r\n\r\nTake care to put salt on all the edges. Salted pelts may be piled on\r\ntop of one another, all pelts fleece down. Curing time should be 15 to\r\n30 days. Check the salt covering weekly. After curing, the pelt can be\r\nscraped to remove connective tissue or flesh. Neatsfoot oil can be\r\nrubbed into the pelt to make it soft and flexible. The fleece can be\r\ncombed and brushed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                   ☆ U.S. GOVERNMENT PRINTING OFFICE: 1977 O-244-090\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n                          TRANSCRIBER’S NOTES\r\n\r\n 1.
