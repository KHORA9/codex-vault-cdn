He has prospered in the past, but\r\nthe future holds still greater and richer prospects. And in no country\r\nin the world are those prospects brighter than in the Commonwealth of\r\nAustralia. The world's surface is gradually filling up, and most of the\r\nolder countries have reached sight of the limit of cultivation, so the\r\nworld's millions have to look to newer lands to provide them with food.\r\nThe great island continent in the southern seas possesses a vast area of\r\nproven wheat land, as yet untouched by the plough. It lies dormant,\r\nfertile, and responsive, awaiting the union of labour and land to yield\r\nabundance of food.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BREAKING UP NEW GROUND.]\r\n\r\nAustralia has many rural industries, but of agriculture wheat is the\r\nmost important, just as it is the most important of the world's crops.\r\nWheat is the king of cereals--the prime essential of civilised life.\r\nNearly half the inhabitants of the globe are wheat-eaters. And the\r\nnumber is growing, for the Eastern races are becoming consumers of\r\nwheat, which is significant of a higher standard of living. For as races\r\nrise in the human scale wheat becomes a more important part of their\r\nfood. This alone shows the increasing importance of the cereal, and the\r\nimportance of the men who grow it. Indeed, the food value of wheat, its\r\nease of cultivation and preparation for human use, the fact that it will\r\ngrow and flourish in so many different soils and climates, and can be\r\nmade into so many and various products, combined with its quick and\r\nbountiful return, all go to enhance the value of wheat grain, and the\r\nprospects of the man who grows it.\r\n\r\nScience is teaching how to produce more wheat from the same area, is\r\nimproving the varieties of wheat and the methods of cultivating it, and\r\nteaching how to restore impoverished lands. And there is still an\r\nenormous area as yet untouched, while land is being utilised now that\r\ntwenty years ago was deemed incapable of growing wheat. Who can tell\r\nwhat the future will find?\r\n\r\nAustralia alone has many millions of acres of wheat land as yet unused\r\nfor that purpose. One of the youngest of nations, yet one of the oldest\r\nparts of the world geologically, it can house and feed millions more\r\nthan its present population. There is room for the extension and\r\ncontinuation of the magnificent progress that wheatgrowing has already\r\nmade. The story of wheat cultivation is the story of progress. In\r\nAustralia, within the last decade, wheatgrowing has advanced rapidly.\r\nRailways have been built out into new districts, and freight is cheap.\r\nTowns have sprung into existence, and the whole aspect of the\r\ncountryside in district after district being altered by increasing\r\nsettlement, where wheatfields have taken the place of sheep paddocks.\r\nThese towns are solvent and prosperous, and certain of a great future,\r\nfor there is room for immensely greater settlement. The majority of the\r\nwheat farms are larger than necessary, and only a small percentage of\r\nthe wheat land is cultivated. The urgent necessity is for more men to\r\nbuild homes and farm these lands. There are both private and public\r\nlands awaiting settlement.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TYPICAL CLASSES OF FARMING LANDS.]\r\n\r\nThe profitable nature of wheatgrowing in Australia is shown by the\r\ncomfortable homesteads and the strong financial position of numerous\r\nfamilies in the wheat districts. Many of these successful\r\nwheatgrowers, indeed most of them, are men who started with little or\r\nno capital in cash, but with plenty of energy and willingness to work.\r\nThey have built homes for themselves in the \"bush,\" and found\r\nprosperity, and there is room for thousands of other men to follow in\r\ntheir footsteps. In a favourable year a wheatfarmer will often receive\r\nas much, or more, for his crop than the capital value of his land.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIRST STAGES OF CROPPING.]\r\n\r\nIn the early stages of wheatgrowing in Australia mistakes were made and\r\nprogress was slow. Wheat was grown in the wrong soil and districts, and\r\nsuitable varieties of the cereal were not available. Cultivation was\r\nconfined to the moist coastal country, with its annual rainfall of 30 to\r\n40 in., and wheat was not a success. The discovery that the drier\r\ndistricts inland were more suitable for wheatgrowing altered the\r\nposition very happily. The bulk of the wheat is now grown in districts\r\nwith a rainfall of 20 to 25 in. and under. This averaged rainfall is\r\nconsidered sufficient for wheatgrowing, and safer than a heavier\r\nrainfall. Wheatgrowing has been most profitable in districts with a\r\nrainfall below 20 in., and an average of 40 bushels per acre has been\r\nharvested from 600 acres. On well-worked fallowed land splendid\r\nmoney-making crops have been gathered, although the growing crop only\r\nhad 2 or 3 in. of rain.\r\n\r\nIn Australian wheat districts the quantity of rain is not as important\r\nas the time of the year in which it falls. Rain is wanted in the early\r\nautumn, so that ploughing can be done, and in the spring, when the wheat\r\nis heading and flowering. With rain in April and May, and again in\r\nSeptember or October, the Australian wheatgrower is assured of a fine\r\ncrop. In the wheat districts those are the seasonable times to get rain.\r\nThe summer is usually dry and warm, and this is one of the main\r\nadvantages from the wheatgrower's standpoint. This fine dry\r\nweather--which is exceptionally healthy for the human being--means the\r\nproduction of a high-class grain, for which there is an unlimited demand\r\nin the world's markets. Unless the common rule is broken, and the season\r\nis unduly wet, there is no fear of rust, and nothing to interfere with\r\nthe haymaking. The main crop, which is kept for grain, can be left\r\nstanding safely in the paddocks until it is thoroughly ripe, when it is\r\ntaken off with a stripper or harvester and bagged. So the districts that\r\nhave heavy summer rains are largely unsuitable for wheatgrowing, but\r\nthose in which the rains fall during the autumn, winter, and spring, and\r\nhave dry summers, are most suitable.\r\n\r\nWhile the present average is low in the Australian wheatgrowing\r\ndistricts compared with other countries, the cost of production is also\r\nremarkably low. Furthermore, methods are improving generally, and a\r\nconsiderable increase in yield can be expected with confidence. The very\r\nrichness of the soil and the kindliness of the climate has tempted\r\ngrowers to adopt speculative methods of growing wheat. The main idea has\r\nbeen to put a large area under crop on the chance of striking a good\r\nyear, when a small fortune may be realised. But growers are being\r\neducated to the value of more careful methods as paying best in the long\r\nrun. The average yield in Australia has been about 11 to 13 bushels per\r\nacre. The total area under wheat and the wheat yield in the different\r\nAustralian States for the season 1913-14 was:--\r\n\r\n\r\n     +------------------+---------------+------------------+-----------+\r\n     |                  |               |                  |  Average  |\r\n     |      State.      | Area.--Acres. | Yield.--Bushels. | per Acre. |\r\n     |------------------+---------------+------------------+-----------+\r\n     |New South Wales   | 3,206,600     |  38,043,360      |   11.09   |\r\n     |Victoria          | 2,786,421     |  32,936,245      |   12.84   |\r\n     |South Australia   | 2,699,632     |  16,736,988      |    7.47   |\r\n     |Western Australia | 1,104,753     |  13,496,242      |   12.02   |\r\n     |Queensland        |   132,655     |   1,769,432      |   13.34   |\r\n     |Tasmania[A]       |    18,054     |     421,380      |   23.33   |\r\n     |                  |---------------|------------------+-----------+\r\n     |                  | 9,948,115     | 103,403,647      |   10.39   |\r\n     +------------------+---------------+------------------+-----------+\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote A: Estimated.]\r\n\r\nAs stated, compared with some of the older countries, such averages seem\r\nsmall, yet in the dry districts of Australia they mean a reasonable\r\nmargin of profit. In such districts it is estimated that a 10-bushel\r\ncrop per acre will pay $0.60 per bushel. Of late years the price\r\nreceived by growers has averaged about $0.84 per bushel.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DISC PLOUGHS ARE POPULAR IN AUSTRALIA.]\r\n\r\nThe average return does not show what a district or country is capable\r\nof producing, as it is reduced by the low yields of careless and\r\nunskilled farmers. The men are responsible, and not the soil or climate.\r\nThere are thousands of farmers who never have a lower average than 20 to\r\n25 bushels, while in some well-farmed districts a whole locality has\r\naveraged nearly 30 bushels to the acre. The whole tendency now is\r\ntowards more careful methods and higher averages, and this will mean\r\ngreater prosperity for the farmers. As it is, men have been wonderfully\r\nsuccessful in growing wheat in Australia, and if this is the case with\r\nthe careless, largely happy-go-lucky style of the past, the prospect is\r\nextremely promising for the future. In a way, new men coming into\r\nAustralia, and taking up wheatgrowing, stand a better chance than many\r\nof the long-settled farmers who have got into a groove--even a\r\nprofitable one--and who do not care to bother greatly with progressive\r\nideas. The new comer has no preconceived notions, and comes with an open\r\nmind adaptable to the teachings of experience.\r\n\r\nThe new settler has his path made easy by the attention the Governments\r\nof the different States are giving to wheatgrowing. In all the States\r\nthere is a Department of Agriculture, and all its accumulated knowledge\r\nis available to the farmer. In all the principal States there are\r\nGovernment Experiment Farms, where new wheats are tried, and also the\r\nbest methods; the results are furnished to the public. In most of the\r\nwheat districts there are demonstration plots showing the best varieties\r\nto grow in the different localities. The new settler is advised what\r\nvarieties to grow in his locality, and when to grow them, what amount of\r\nfertiliser to use, and the best methods of handling his land. In any\r\ndifficulty the resources of the Department of Agriculture are at his\r\nservice. At the Government farms crops of the best wheats are grown, and\r\nthe seed distributed amongst the farmers, while inspectors are\r\ncontinually travelling through the country lecturing and visiting the\r\ngrowers, and advising them, whenever advice is asked for. With such\r\nfacilities the future of the settler practically depends upon the use he\r\nmakes of his opportunities, and the opportunities are unsurpassed in any\r\nother country.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PUTTING IN SEED.]\r\n\r\nIn the wheat districts the summer is warm, and the thermometer often\r\nregisters over 100 degs. Fahr., but it is a dry, healthy heat that is\r\nnot as uncomfortable as the lower temperatures in moister climates. The\r\nwarm weather holds for two or three months in midsummer, when the heat\r\nduring the day is trying, but for the remainder of the year the climate\r\nis perfect. The winter is mild, so much so that live stock need no\r\nshelter, and often fatten on the natural pasture throughout the year.\r\nFarming operations can be conducted throughout the year. There is no\r\nsnow or period when work is practically at a standstill.\r\n\r\n\r\nAUSTRALIAN WHEAT AREA.\r\n\r\nOn the average of the past five years the wheat yield of Australia\r\nrepresents about 2 per cent. of the world's production. The return per\r\nacre is low, but as has been pointed out, the cost of production is\r\nlikewise low, and it is doubtful if in any other country the business of\r\ngrowing wheat is more profitable. The area now cultivated is but a mere\r\npercentage of what could be put under wheat profitably. The exact area\r\nis almost impossible to arrive at, for the simple reason that with\r\nimproved methods and better varieties of wheat, the extent of country in\r\nwhich the cereal can be successfully grown increases.\r\n\r\nFor practical purposes the area deemed suitable for wheatgrowing is that\r\nwhich has sufficient rainfall to admit of ploughing being carried out at\r\nthe right time of the year, as already stated, from March to June, to\r\ncover the growing period, and to fill the grain during September and\r\nOctober. In other words, it is not so much a matter of what the annual\r\nrainfall is as when the rain usually falls. The State of New South Wales\r\nfor example. For a long time land with less than a rainfall of 20 in.\r\nhas been excluded from the area considered safe for profitable\r\nwheatgrowing. Even then the area in that State suitable for wheat covers\r\n25 million acres. In the State of South Australia farmers place the\r\nannual rainfall limit at 16 in., provided it is regular and the land is\r\nproperly worked. If wheat can be grown on that rainfall in the latter\r\nState, and the evidence is that it certainly can, at least another\r\n10,000,000 acres can be added to the wheat belt of the State. Although,\r\ntherefore, the present area under wheat (1913-14) is only 3,206,600\r\nacres, there are 35,000,000 acres on a moderate estimate in New South\r\nWales alone that can grow wheat profitably. And experiments in the west\r\nshow that a still greater extension of the wheat belt can be looked for,\r\nespecially with improvement in the breeding of varieties suitable for\r\nthe dryer districts. At present, however, there is no necessity for\r\nsettlers to go outside the area of \"safe country.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: (1) TYPICAL AUSTRALIAN FARM SCENE. (2) PREPARING WHEAT\r\nFOR HARVEST. (3) PLOUGHING.]\r\n\r\nWhat can be achieved in dry districts with a limited and intermittent\r\nrainfall has been most forcibly proved by experience. At Messrs. Gagie\r\nBros.' farm, Spy Hill, West Wyalong, New South Wales, a yield of 24\r\nbushels of wheat was obtained in the 1911-12 season on a rainfall of 668\r\npoints--less than 7 in.! Of course, such a crop could not be grown on\r\nsuch a rainfall alone, as a much larger quantity of water would be\r\nrequired to produce that amount of wheat. The crop during the growing\r\nperiod only received 668 points of rain, but in the land on which it was\r\ngrown, and which was fallowed and properly worked, a large quantity of\r\nmoisture was stored from the previous year, and on this reserve the\r\ngrowing crop grew, and with the additional 668 points that fell during\r\nthe growing period a yield of 24 bushels per acre was obtained.\r\n\r\nStill more remarkable were the results obtained in the same season from\r\nexperiment plots on the farm of Mr. Carew, Deniliquin, in the same\r\nState. The seed was sown on well-worked fallow land in which a good\r\namount of the previous year's rainfall had been conserved. The rainfall\r\nduring the growing period was 322 points, distributed as follows:--May,\r\n210; June, 60; July, 12; August, nil; September, 37; October, 3 points.\r\nUnder ordinary conditions such a rainfall would mean utter failure of a\r\nwheat crop, yet in this case a yield of 14 bushels per acre was\r\nobtained.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A FINE CROP OF WHEAT.]\r\n\r\nAgain at Mr. G. Laidlaw's farm, \"Elm Park,\" Jindera, Albury, New South\r\nWales, 28 bushels 56 lbs. were obtained on fallowed land with a rainfall\r\nof 752 points.\r\n\r\nWith a seasonal distribution of rain wheat can be successfully grown\r\nwith an average of 10 in. There are growers in country that ten years\r\nago was considered outside the wheat belt, that is, the safe country,\r\nwho for the last five years have never harvested less than an average of\r\n25 bushels per acre. Yet an average of 12 to 15 bushels has proved\r\nprofitable.\r\n\r\nIn Victoria, wheatgrowing can increase fivefold before the whole of the\r\nsuitable land is brought under the plough. The wheat crop of that State\r\nshould, if the settlers are forthcoming, within a few years reach\r\n8,000,000 acres, provided that one-third of each farm is regularly\r\ncultivated. The area under wheat in 1913-14 was 2,786,421 acres, so\r\nthere is room for thousands of growers yet.\r\n\r\nIn South Australia and in Western Australia there are immense areas,\r\nrunning into millions of acres, which yet remain to be brought under\r\nwheat. In Queensland wheatgrowing practically remains to be developed.\r\nAt present stockraising proves most profitable, but there is no question\r\nthat in the course of time that State will add immensely to the wheat\r\nbelt of the Commonwealth. In all the States the usual course has been\r\nfor wheat to follow stockraising, after the latter have sweetened and\r\nimproved the soil, making it more compact and suitable for cultivation.\r\nIn new lands, where the soil has been practically untrodden for ages, it\r\nis seldom immediately suitable for the cultivation of wheat, in what\r\nlater on proved to be ideal wheat districts. Therefore, in such a vast\r\ncountry as Australia, which totals 2,974,581 square miles, it is beyond\r\nman's calculations to even estimate what proportion may ultimately come\r\nunder the plough.\r\n\r\nAt the present time, however, it is far from extravagant to say that\r\nwhile Australia is now, roughly, producing 100,000,000 bushels of wheat\r\non 10,000,000 acres, it is capable, without improving the average yield,\r\nof producing 1,000,000,000 bushels of wheat from 100,000,000 acres. And\r\nas the experience of good farms has conclusively demonstrated that the\r\naverage yield could be much greater than it is at present, with good\r\nfarming methods, the general use of more suitable varieties of wheat,\r\nnot to mention the still greater improvement in the breeding of suitable\r\nwheats, that yield should certainly be half as much again. Australia\r\ntherefore stands out as promising to be one of the greatest\r\nwheat-producing countries in the world.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AUSTRALIA'S AVERAGE WHEAT YIELD IS FROM 11 TO 13 BUSHELS\r\nPER ACRE, BUT THOUSANDS OF FARMS YIELD FROM 20 TO 25 BUSHELS PER ACRE.]\r\n\r\nAustralia has the land and climate; she wants the men.\r\n\r\nThere is a large area of country in Victoria, South Australia, and New\r\nSouth Wales known as the Mallee, the name being derived from a dense\r\ndwarf eucalyptus scrub which covers the land in its natural state. For a\r\nlong period this land was deemed unfit for wheatgrowing on account\r\nmainly of the low rainfall, and, away from the River Murray, absence of\r\nwater supply. Experience has long since proved that it is very\r\nprofitable wheat land when properly worked, while the discovery of a\r\nsub-artesian water supply and good water-holding country has overcome\r\nmost of the difficulty that first faced settlement. There is a large\r\narea of this land available for share farming, and a great area is also\r\nbeing opened up for settlement, particularly in South Australia. There\r\nis thus a sound prospect fronting the new settler, as he might start on\r\nthe Mallee country share farming, and on what he has earned establish\r\nhimself on a holding of his own, with all the advantage of a practical\r\nexperience of that particular type of land and the climate. The Mallee\r\nsoil is mostly sandy loam, but red and black loams, varying from sand to\r\nclay, are found. It is a low elevation above sea level, but the country\r\nis undulating. The vegetation is reckoned a sound guide to the quality\r\nof the soil for wheatgrowing; indeed, this same principle can be\r\naccepted in all parts of the wheat belt. On the Mallee the richest parts\r\nare denoted by the pines and bull oak trees, while the large and small\r\nMallee marks good and medium loams and clays.\r\n\r\nThe Mallee land is suitable for handling by the man with small means,\r\neither on a farm of his own or as a share farmer, as in the first case\r\nthe clearing is cheap, while in the second he can handle a large area.\r\nThe scrub is broken down by rollers, and is comparatively easily\r\neradicated. For a time young suckers come up amongst the wheat crop, but\r\nthey are burnt off when the standing stubble is burnt after the crop has\r\nbeen taken off, and in time quite cleaned out. The soil is naturally\r\nrich in potash, nitrogen, and lime, but requires superphosphate, as the\r\npercentage of phosphoric acid is low. Although the average yield is\r\nlower than other parts of the wheat belt, wheatgrowing has proved very\r\nprofitable in the Mallee country, and there is plenty of evidence of\r\nthat fact.\r\n\r\nIn Victoria the Mallee country is an important part of the wheat belt of\r\nthat State, there being over 800,000 acres under wheat last season\r\n(1913-14) out of a total area for that State of 2,786,421 acres. Yet it\r\nis only within the last ten years that it has had any reputation for\r\nfarming, being mostly looked upon as useless. Most of the first settlers\r\nwere share farmers with little capital, but with brains and energy, and\r\nmany of them are now worth from $50,000.00 to $100,000.00. There were\r\nfailures in the early days, because there was want of knowledge of the\r\nproper methods of working low-rainfall country for growing wheat, and\r\nalso proper methods and lack of proper implements for that class of\r\ncountry. Suitable implements, especially \"stump-jump\" implements, have\r\nbeen evolved, and there is a solid guide for the new settlers to follow.\r\nOne of the leading farmers in the Mallee country in Victoria, Mr. R.\r\nBlackwood, at Hopetoun, where the soil is of average quality and the\r\nrainfall less than 14 in., started on the share system in 1892. It was\r\nseven years before he adopted the \"bare fallow\" method, an essential in\r\nsuch country, and since doing so he has averaged 16 bushels per acre. In\r\nthe record dry year (1902) his crop went 8 bushels to the acre, and paid\r\nworking expenses. By 1913 he was the owner of 5000 acres. He crops about\r\n650 acres each year, and fallows about the same area, working on a\r\nthree-year rotation of fallow, wheat, grazing.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CARTING STOOKS.]\r\n\r\n\r\nFACTORS GOVERNING WHEATGROWING.\r\n\r\nThe principal factors governing wheatgrowing in Australia are:--\r\n\r\n\r\n     Conservation of soil moisture by fallowing the land.\r\n\r\n     Sowing of varieties of wheat most suitable for the different\r\n     districts.\r\n\r\n     Judicious use of fertilisers.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe settler has not to find these things out for himself. He has the\r\nassistance of well-organised and progressive departments of agriculture\r\nin the different States to tell him what to do, how and when to do it.\r\nThe working of his land is a matter upon which he will be fully\r\ninformed. He will have the scientific experience of the departmental\r\nexperts, the examples of local experimental plots, and the experience of\r\nworking farmers to guide him in regard to the best method of working his\r\nsoil. Methods vary somewhat in different soils and districts, as has\r\nbeen previously stated.\r\n\r\nHe is informed as to the best varieties to sow in his district and the\r\nproper time to sow them. The completeness of that information can be\r\ngathered from the following particulars which are supplied by the\r\nDepartment of Agriculture in New South Wales every season. Similar\r\ninformation is furnished in other States. In New South Wales a\r\nclassification of varieties of wheat is made by the department, and a\r\ntable published for the information of wheatgrowers. The following is\r\nthe classification for the season 1913-14:--\r\n\r\n\r\n     With regard to time of maturity varieties of wheat recommended were\r\n     classified as follows:--\r\n\r\n\r\n     Very Early.--Bunyip, Florence, Firbank.\r\n\r\n     Early.--Comeback, Thew, Steinwedel.\r\n\r\n     Mid-season.--Bobs, John Brown, Cedar, Warren, Federation, Bayah,\r\n     Rymer.\r\n\r\n     Late.--Jonathan, Marshall's No. 3, Zealand, Yandilla King,\r\n     Cleveland, Huguenot.\r\n\r\n     Very Late.--Hayne's Blue Stem.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn respect of time of sowing the varieties mentioned above were\r\nrecommended in inverse order.\r\n\r\nJust as the farmer is advised as to the most suitable varieties of wheat\r\nfor his district, so experiments are conducted to ascertain the most\r\nuseful quantity of manure, and full particulars made available in the\r\nagricultural gazettes or journals which are published in the different\r\nStates, as well as being made available in bulletin form. The question\r\nof manuring is a very important one to the wheatgrower, as it influences\r\nthe yield greatly in most of the principal areas, if not all. As\r\nAustralian wheat soils possess abundance of nitrogen and sufficient\r\npotash, but are mostly deficient in phosphoric acid, the manure chiefly\r\nused on the wheatfields is superphosphates. There are some localities\r\nwhere further experiment is required to definitely ascertain the most\r\nsuitable fertiliser, but in the main superphosphate is the requirement,\r\nand practically the only manure used. This has been the course proved\r\nmost satisfactory by practical experience in wheatgrowing, and careful\r\nexperiment also with nitrogenous, pathonic, and phosphate manures,\r\nsingly and combined. Superphosphate has proved superior to bonedust or\r\nbasic slag; sulphate of potash has not increased the yield, while\r\nnitrogenous fertilisers, such as dried blood or sulphate of ammonia,\r\nhave proved either useless or harmful. In New South Wales the quantity\r\nof superphosphate usually used is 56 lbs. per acre, and the same\r\nquantity is generally applied in Victoria, but in South Australia the\r\ndressings are much heavier, running from 1 cwt. to 2 cwts. per acre. In\r\nNew South Wales experiments carried out clearly prove that larger\r\nquantities, say, 84-112 lbs. to the acre, do not result in bigger yields\r\nbeing obtained, while the still heavier quantities, 1-1/2 to 2 cwt.,\r\nhave actually resulted in poorer yields.\r\n\r\nIn Victoria about 56 lbs. of superphosphate to the acre is also the\r\nusual thing, but the amount used averages probably from 56 to 84 lbs.;\r\nthe drier districts require less, and the wetter districts more, than\r\nthese amounts. Remarkable results are obtained from such small dressings\r\nas 30 lbs. of superphosphate.\r\n\r\nIn South Australia heavier dressings of superphosphate are used than in\r\nthe other States. Wheatgrowing in South Australia was, in fact,\r\nrevolutionised and changed into a most profitable business through the\r\nintroduction and general practice of using this artificial fertiliser.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WITH AUSTRALIAN STRIPPER HARVESTERS WHEAT IS HARVESTED,\r\nTHRESHED AND PUT INTO THE BAG FOR 8 TO 10 CENTS PER BUSHEL.]\r\n\r\nCommercial fertilisers are analysed by the Departments of Agriculture,\r\nand official lists are published showing their content.\r\n\r\nThe Australian wheatgrower is practically not troubled with wheat\r\ndiseases. Thirty years ago rust was a trouble, but the breeding of\r\nrust-resistant varieties of wheat has effectually overcome that\r\ndrawback, and rust is seldom, if ever, heard of now. In addition,\r\nwheatgrowing is now carried on in districts where the conditions are\r\nseldom favourable to rust, which is only liable to cause serious loss\r\nwhen there is hot, moist weather late in the spring. This weather is\r\nvery rarely experienced in the Australian wheat belt, and certainly\r\nlittle has been heard of rust for many years.\r\n\r\nSmut is the only other important parasitic disease, but as the practice\r\nof \"pickling\" seed before sowing is extending, this trouble has\r\npractically disappeared. Bunt or stinking smut is so called because it\r\nhas an objectionable smell, which makes its presence known in the grain\r\nand deteriorates its value. As stated, it can be readily prevented by\r\ntreating the seed. Smut belongs to a low form of plant life, and the\r\nplant is produced from a seed, which in its turn matures and produces\r\nother seed, which are microscopic and are known as spores. These spores\r\nare found when matured in masses occupying the place of the wheat\r\nkernels, and these masses are called bunt-balls. The chief and almost\r\nonly cause of smut is sowing wheat seed which has healthy smut spores\r\nattached to it. By destroying the vitality of these spores the grain\r\ncrop will be clean.\r\n\r\nThe most common solutions for pickling wheat seed are bluestone (copper\r\nsulphate) 1-1/2 lb. to 10 gallons of water, and formalin 1 lb. to 45\r\ngallons of water. Bunt balls are lighter than wheat, and float in water,\r\nso if the wheat to be treated is poured slowly into the pickle, and in\r\nsuch a way that the bunt balls will not be carried down by the grain,\r\nthey will float on top, and can be skimmed off and destroyed. The\r\ndetails of pickling vary on different farms, but a common method is to\r\nplace the wheat about 2 bushels at a time in loosely-tied butts or bags,\r\nand then by means of a lever it is lowered into the solution for two or\r\nthree minutes, when it is raised on to a sloping trough, where the\r\nsuperfluous solution can drain back into the cask. Another method is to\r\nplace the seed wheat, either loose or in bags, in elevated casks or\r\ntroughs made out of hollow logs, and pour the bluestone solution over\r\nit. After it has remained on the wheat the necessary time it is run off\r\ninto another cask or trough placed in a lower position. After the seed\r\nhas been treated it requires some time drying before it can be sown\r\nthrough the drill. All that is necessary is to place the butts where\r\nthey can drain freely, and the seed will be ready to sow after a few\r\nhours.\r\n\r\nThe fullest particulars as to the best way of combating this disease or\r\nany minor trouble is always obtainable from the Departments of\r\nAgriculture in the various States.\r\n\r\n\"Take-all\" occasionally affects wheat crops growing under any\r\ndisadvantageous set of conditions, but good farming is a remedy for that\r\ntrouble, which is a minor one.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECURING A WHEAT FARM.\r\n\r\nWheat land may be secured through public or private channels, but the\r\narea of available Government lands is greater in some States than\r\nothers. The landseeker having decided in which State he is going to\r\nreside, will adopt the means of securing a wheat farm best suited to his\r\ncapital. Not only are Crown lands being opened up, principally by\r\nrailway construction, but in some States the Government purchases\r\nprivate estates, which are subdivided and sold in small areas to farmers\r\non exceptionally easy terms. Estates are also being constantly so\r\nsubdivided by private owners, and sold on terms extending over ten,\r\nfifteen, and twenty years. With ordinary good fortune the farmer going\r\non such estates is in a sound and safe position after three or four\r\nseasons. If he has the misfortune to experience a dry season at the\r\nstart, it will, of course, take him longer to work to independence, as\r\ncan easily be understood. On the other hand a normal year will see him\r\nwell started and safe for another two or three seasons, while a really\r\ngood year will place him in a position which means that only\r\ncarelessness and improvidence can prevent him from attaining comfortable\r\nand practically independent circumstances.\r\n\r\nIn the different States information can be obtained from the Government\r\nInformation Bureau or Departments of Lands as to what Government lands\r\nare available for settlement.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HARVESTER AS USED IN AUSTRALIA.]\r\n\r\nThe particulars of private lands for sale may be obtained from city and\r\ncountry agents. They vary considerably in price according to the\r\nlocality, nature of improvements and proximity to railways. They may be\r\nsaid to range from $16.80 to $38.40 per acre for improved land. In the\r\nmajority of cases such lands are either cleared or partly cleared, and\r\nthe settler is able to put in a crop right away, providing he obtains\r\npossession at a seasonable time. The ploughing and sowing period is\r\nmainly in April and May, and running to June, harvesting taking place in\r\nNovember and December. The almost invariable practice in Australia is to\r\ncombine wheatgrowing and sheepfarming. Sheep are especially profitable\r\nin Australia. This is an excellent combination, as the busy periods do\r\nnot clash, and the sheep help to fertilise the land, clear the stubble\r\npaddocks, and are also often useful for the purpose of eating down a\r\ncrop in the early stages where it may be making an unduly rapid growth.\r\n\r\nIn most districts 250 acres of wheat is as much as one man can manage\r\nwithout outside help, except at harvest time, although some energetic\r\nfarmers manage 300 acres. In the more settled districts wheat farms\r\nusually range from 300 to 600 acres, but larger farms, up to four and\r\nfive thousand acres, are common. They are either worked on shares (see\r\np. 38), or with hired labour, and are usually owned by men who have\r\nstarted on a small area, and increased it by subsequent purchase with\r\nmoney made from wheatgrowing. On many large properties hitherto devoted\r\nto sheepraising the practice is growing of putting down a large area\r\nunder wheat.\r\n\r\nIt is not practical to definitely state the amount of capital required\r\nto purchase and prepare an area of land for a wheat farm. Much will\r\ndepend upon the capacity and experience, business acumen, and\r\nresourcefulness of the settler, as is the case in all callings, but the\r\ndetailed information given in these pages should enable the intending\r\nsettler to work out the amount approximately required by his condition\r\nand the lines he intends adopting.\r\n\r\n\r\nWORKING PLANT REQUIRED.\r\n\r\nThe intending settler has to consider not only the capital required to\r\nsecure his farm, whatever its nature, but also the expenditure necessary\r\nin obtaining a working farm plant. Prices of machinery cover a wide\r\nrange, according to size, &c. In working 200 to 250 acres of wheat\r\ncrop, the following plant would be required, and the prices given are\r\napproximately correct:--\r\n\r\n\r\n     Five horses (good selected mares, if possible,\r\n     that will give an annual return of, say,\r\n     four foals), at $144 per head                    $720.00\r\n\r\n     Five sets of harness                               72.00\r\n\r\n     One dray and set harness                           86.00\r\n\r\n     One four-furrow plough                            144.00\r\n\r\n     One set of harrows                                 33.00\r\n\r\n     One seed drill                                    182.00\r\n\r\n     One cultivator                                     96.00\r\n                                                       ------\r\n         Implements for putting in and working\r\n           growing crop                              $1333.00\r\n\r\n     One reaper and binder                             142.00\r\n\r\n     One stripper-harvester                            430.00\r\n                                                     --------\r\n     Total                                           $1905.00\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: STEAM THRESHER AT WORK.]\r\n\r\nA chaffcutter ($67.00) might be added to the above list, and in some\r\nlocalities a roller, costing about $19.00, is required. The price of\r\nhorses varies. In the above list they have been placed at $144.00, but\r\nsuitable animals may be secured for $96.00 to $120.00 per head. As soon\r\nas he can manage it the new farmer will want to get a waggon ($168.00).\r\nHe will soon want a vehicle to move about in, a sulky ($72.00 to\r\n$96.00), a light horse and harness, saddle, &c. Minor implements and\r\ntools for fencing, carpentering, building, and so on will be wanted, and\r\naltogether it would be well to reckon that working plant generally will\r\ncost about $2400.00. To work a large area would not cost more\r\nproportionately by any means; it is reckoned that an area of 600 acres\r\nof cultivation costs about $3360.00 for working plant.\r\n\r\nAll the above parts of the plant would not be required at once, and the\r\nabove amounts can be greatly reduced by obtaining smaller implements,\r\nlighter horses, and so on. Furthermore, it is not necessary that the\r\nfull amount should be paid down for the plant. Cash would have to be\r\npaid for the horses, but machinery and most of the balance of the plant\r\ncan be acquired on terms, part payment being in cash, while the balance\r\nruns over till after harvest, or even over two seasons. Usually\r\none-third is paid in cash, and the balance about February or March,\r\nafter the farmer has received the money for his crop. It is to the\r\ninterest of the machinery firms, storekeepers, and others who do\r\nbusiness with the wheatfarmer to help him as far as possible, especially\r\nin the early years, and in Australia, when a man shows he is honest and\r\nhard-working, he will receive every consideration in this direction.\r\n\r\nThe wheatgrower has also to allow for the keep of himself and his family\r\nwhile waiting for his crop to ripen.\r\n\r\nIn the above plant a stripper-harvester has been allowed for, but if a\r\nstripper and winnower be used instead, the cost for implements would be\r\nabout $120.00 less. On the other hand, more labour would be required to\r\nwork them. The utilisation of the stripper-harvester is the most popular\r\nmethod of taking off a wheat crop.\r\n\r\nThe stripper is an Australian invention. It is a machine drawn through\r\nthe ripe standing crop by three or four horses attached to its side. The\r\nhorses walk in the stubble of the harvested portion. The ripe ears\r\ncoming within reach of the machine, which has a 5-ft. cut, are gathered\r\nby a comb, and directed to a cutting plate, where the beater drum cuts\r\nthem from the straw and threshes the grain out. At the same time the\r\ngrain, with the chaff and some straw, is thrown into a receptacle at the\r\nback of the machine. When this is full the stripper is driven to a\r\npicked place in the paddock and emptied. Here a winnower has been\r\nplaced, and the mixture of grain and rubbish out of the stripper is put\r\nthrough this winnower, which cleans and bags the wheat ready for market.\r\nIn fair crops one winnower, with four men to work it, will keep two\r\nstrippers going.\r\n\r\nThe stripper-harvester is another Australian invention. It is an\r\nimprovement on the stripper, and is now in more general use. It is\r\nreally a combined stripper and winnower. It takes off the heads of\r\nwheat, and also threshes and cleans them as it goes along, and delivers\r\nthe grain into bags at the side of the machine. This reduces the cost of\r\nharvesting, as less labour is required. Two men can work a harvester,\r\none driving the machine while the other removes and sews up the bags.\r\nThe machines cut 5 to 6 ft., but 8-ft. machines have proved successful\r\nof late, and with them a good area can be handled in a day. The smaller\r\nmachine will strip about 10 acres of a fair crop in a working day.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: (1) STEAM THRESHER. (2) STOOK-BUILDING. (3) HARVEST\r\nPICNIC. (4) BALING FOR EXPORT. (5) STOOKS READY FOR CARTING.]\r\n\r\n\r\nWORKING THE WHEAT FARM.\r\n\r\nThe settler having acquired his land, he will require to fence in his\r\nholding, and also subdivide it into convenient paddocks or fields. All\r\nAustralian farms are fenced, and in districts in which the rabbit is a\r\nmenace the boundary fences are wire-netted. Unless timber is very\r\nplentiful wire fences are almost universal. Posts, which are obtained\r\nfrom timber on the farm that is fallen, and split into the necessary\r\nlengths, are erected 9 or 11 ft. apart, with six or seven wires running\r\nthrough them. Sometimes the posts are put at a greater distance apart,\r\nand \"droppers\" placed between them at distances of 7 or 8 ft. Some of\r\nthese droppers are of split timber, but patent droppers, made of wire\r\nand iron, can be obtained. Where timber is scarce such fences are\r\ncheaper. The droppers hold the wires to which they are attached in their\r\nplace, but are not sunk into the ground. Fencing costs about $144.00 to\r\n$168.00 per mile. Netting the fences to keep out the rabbit costs an\r\nadditional $192.00 to $240.00 per mile. If the new farm consists of\r\nimproved, that is, cleared or partly cleared land, the settler will\r\nprobably get his crop in before he does his fencing. It would be better\r\nfor him to do that than leave his sowing till unduly late.\r\n\r\nWhere green timber has to be cleared off the land it is ringbarked\r\nfirst, and the trees allowed to die before they are grubbed out.\r\nRingbarking consists of cutting a small strip of bark from around the\r\ntrunk of the tree to prevent the flow of sap keeping it alive. After\r\nringbarking, the trees usually throw out young shoots or \"suckers,\"\r\nwhich have to be broken off. Usually this has to be done twice, and is\r\ncalled suckering. The deeper the trees are ringbarked, the bigger the\r\npiece of bark removed, the sooner it will die, but there is then a\r\ngreater tendency to throw out suckers. The trees take two or three years\r\nto die, then they are grubbed and burnt. It is very seldom that the\r\ngreen trees are cut out at once, as this is very much more expensive,\r\nand for some time after removal the ground is too sour to be good for\r\nwheat or other crops. When the country is ringbarked the ground\r\nsweetens, and by the time the tree is dead is ready for cropping. While\r\nthe trees are dying the country is usually used for grazing sheep and\r\nother stock, as it will be carrying good pasture. Of recent years a\r\nsystem has been tried, with considerable success, of poisoning the green\r\ntimber with a mixture of arsenic and soda and water. A ring is chopped\r\nround the tree, and the bark thus makes a rough cup, into which the\r\nmixture is poured. This treatment has proved very effective.\r\n\r\nThe cost of ringbarking and all similar operations, of course, depends\r\nupon the amount of timber on the country, but it usually costs from 24\r\ncents to 30 cents per acre, while suckering costs 8 cents to 12 cents\r\nper acre. After the trees are dead they are grubbed or burnt out, all\r\nroots to 12 or 18 in. depth being removed, and this work costs from\r\n$2.80 to $3.60 per acre. In some cases the country is what is known as\r\n\"Yankee-grubbed,\" in which case the trees are cut off level with the\r\nground, and roots allowed to remain in below the surface. When the\r\ncountry was used for grazing only, this was found a cheap and efficient\r\nmethod, but nevertheless only a small proportion of Australian wheat\r\ncountry has been so treated. To cultivate \"Yankee-grubbed\" country what\r\nare known as stump-jump implements, ploughs and cultivators are used.\r\nThese are available on the market, and as \"Yankee-grubbing\" is certainly\r\ncheaper than the usual method of grubbing, it has some attraction to the\r\nman with limited capital. The more careful farmers, however, do not\r\nadvocate this method.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THRESHING BY HORSE POWER.]\r\n\r\nIt must be remembered that the above prices for clearing are where\r\nlabour has to be employed. It must also be remembered that the amount of\r\ntimber on different classes of wheat country in the different States\r\nvaries very much, so while it is usually estimated that clearing land\r\nfor wheat costs about $4.30 per acre, it does not mean that it will\r\nalways cost that, or, in any case, that the settler has to pay that\r\namount out in cash. After the timber is grubbed and pulled down it is\r\nusually piled together and burnt. It burns well, and the burning\r\nenriches the soil. The settler starting in to clear his farm has ever\r\nthe future picture in mind of when the work is done, and he has a\r\nbeautifully-cleared, improved property on which to spend the latter\r\nyears of his life. And there is no finer picture than an improved wheat\r\nfarm, with its alternation of park-like paddocks, paddocks carrying a\r\nflock of sheep, paddocks of growing crops, and paddocks of fallowing\r\nploughed land ready for the crop next season, or perhaps carrying a\r\nrotation crop of oats, rape, or cowpea. The homestead, surrounded by its\r\norchard, stables, hayshed, and machinery sheds, and poultry run, will\r\nstand upon a rise, from which the whole property can be surveyed. And\r\nto none is the picture finer than to the man who by his own toil and\r\nenergy has cleared and improved most of those paddocks. Such wheat farms\r\nare to be found in thousands throughout Australia.\r\n\r\nOne of the first things the settler has to do is to provide a water\r\nsupply. It is the exception to find wheat farms with a natural permanent\r\nwater supply, such as a creek or river. In most cases the settler\r\ndepends upon tanks or dams for watering his stock. A suitable low-lying\r\nsite is picked, and the earth is scooped out and banked up at the end\r\nand sides, so there is a hole into which the rainwater runs, following\r\nthe natural lay of the country, and assisted and directed by drains and\r\ngutters. These tanks, as they are called, usually range from 1000 to\r\n2000 cubic yards, and cost up to 24 cents or 30 cents per yard to\r\nexcavate. In most districts the country holds water splendidly, and when\r\nthe tank is filled by the autumn and winter rains it will carry through\r\nthe summer. For domestic use galvanised tanks are depended upon, being\r\nplaced to catch the rainwater off the rooms of the homestead buildings.\r\nIn some districts water is obtained by sinking shallow wells. In parts\r\nof the wheat country sub-artesian wells are also common, good water\r\nbeing obtained by boring 200 to 300 ft., when an unfailing supply of\r\ngood water for stock is secured. The real artesian country, where deep\r\nbores are sunk for water, is outside the present wheat belt.\r\n\r\nIn the season ploughing usually starts at 7.30 a.m. and goes on until\r\n5.30 p.m., with a break of a couple of hours during the day for dinner;\r\nthat is, where labour is employed. The settler himself handling his own\r\nland usually works from dawn till dark, using changes of horses during\r\nthe day. Both mouldboard and disc ploughs are in use, some soils suiting\r\none and some the other, while use for both will often be found on the\r\none farm. The four-furrow plough, drawn by five or six horses, is most\r\nfavoured, and with it four to six acres will be done in a day. Harrowing\r\nis done with a set of three to six sections of tines, covering from 12\r\nto 20 ft. in width, and doing 15 to 20 acres a day. The bulk of the\r\nsowing is done with a combined drill, which plants the seed and\r\ndistributes artificial fertiliser at the same time. The amount of seed\r\nsown per acre varies from 25 to 45 lbs., and even up to 100 lbs. in some\r\nparts of the Commonwealth, while usually about the same amount of\r\nsuperphosphate is distributed, 45 to 60 lbs. being the most common\r\nquantity. Both hoes and disc drills are in use, ranging from twelve to\r\nfifteen tubes, the tubes being 7 in. apart. These particulars apply\r\nmostly to the man cultivating 200 to 300 acres himself.\r\n\r\nIt is often found beneficial to harrow the growing crop until it is 3 or\r\n4 in. high. While the crop is growing the settler will find plenty to do\r\nin clearing and improving his property, attending to his sheep, and so\r\non. If he is on shares he will find work for his team and himself on\r\nother properties, at contract work, or on the local roads.\r\n\r\nHarvest time comes well on in the summer, and for several weeks everyone\r\nis busy on the farm. It is usual when putting in a wheat crop to sow a\r\nportion for hay. Either a separate crop is sown or a special variety\r\nsuitable for hay is sown around the main grain crop. This is cut with\r\nthe reaper and binder just after the wheat plant has flowered. The\r\nsheaves, which are tied by the machine, are stooked in the paddock for\r\nten or fourteen days until dry enough to be carted in and stacked. The\r\nclimate--as a rule fine weather prevails--is favourable to haymaking,\r\nand a bright-coloured nutritious hay is produced. The average yield is a\r\nton to one ton and a-half to the acre, but three, four, and even five\r\nton crops are taken off, but that is usually in a crop sown and\r\ncultivated specially for hay with the intention of supplying the chaff\r\nmarket, which is an industry in itself. The wheatfarmer, properly\r\nspeaking, only cuts what he will require for his own horses. A reaper\r\nand binder is drawn by three horses, and will cut from 10 to 12 acres\r\nper day. One man is required to drive the machine, and one or two men to\r\npick up and stook the sheaves. Some farmers cut their own hay for chaff,\r\nworking the machine either by hand or with horse-works for turning the\r\ncutting wheel, but the majority have the hay cut by contractors, who\r\ntravel through the country with a special plant for the purpose,\r\ncharging $2.16 per ton for cutting. After a portion round the edges of\r\nthe crops has been cut for hay a strip of land is ploughed around the\r\ncrop in the stubble for the purpose of making a break in case of fire,\r\nand thus enabling a fire that might approach the crop being controlled\r\non the bare ploughed ground.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CARTING WHEAT TO RAILWAY STATION.]\r\n\r\nThe wheat crop is allowed to become dead ripe in the paddock, as for\r\nstripping the ears must be dry and quite ripe. Once it is ready to strip\r\nevery effort is made to take the crop off as quickly as possible, as it\r\ndoes not improve standing, for some of the grain is likely to be shaken\r\nout by winds. The more modern wheats, however, hold the grain\r\nwonderfully against wind or hail. Varieties of wheat are sown so they\r\nwill mature at different times, which extends the harvesting period, as\r\none crop will be ready to harvest before the other is quite ripe, and\r\nthere is thus a useful rotation. At harvesting time work usually starts\r\nin the paddock about 8 a.m., as the wheat does not strip well until the\r\nhot sun gets on it, as it toughens during the night. The work goes on\r\nuntil 7 or 7.30 p.m., with a break of two hours at mid-day, and spells\r\nof twenty minutes in the morning and afternoon. Where labour is employed\r\none man drives the harvester, but his horses are looked after, fed,\r\ngroomed, and harnessed for him. This saves time, and enables the crop to\r\nbe taken off the more quickly. Of course, the farmer in a small way will\r\ndo his own work, requiring only a little assistance at harvest time,\r\nsomeone to sew up and stack the bags. As there is always a rush at\r\nharvest time, the bags of grain are often left lying in the paddocks in\r\nsmall heaps until the crop is all off, when they are carted to the\r\nrailway or mill. Some farmers do their own carting, but the majority pay\r\nthe regular carriers to do this work, the cost varying according to\r\ndistance, but is generally done for 24 cents per ton per mile. About\r\n12-1/2 bags of wheat go to the ton.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AUSTRALIAN WHEAT FOR EXPORT FROM FARM TO WHARF.]\r\n\r\nAt present in Australia wheat is all handled in bags which contain about\r\n3 bushels of grain. The price of empty bags varies from $1.50 to $2.00\r\nper doz. Very few second-hand bags are used. The different State\r\nGovernments in Australia are now considering the wisdom of introducing\r\nthe American system of handling wheat in bulk. The Governments of New\r\nSouth Wales and of Western Australia have definitely announced their\r\nintention of establishing that system, while it is being favourably\r\nconsidered in Victoria. Once the system was introduced in any of the\r\nStates it would probably be only a short time before it was adopted\r\nthroughout the Commonwealth. At present, however, bags are in\r\nuniversal use, the grain being thus carried both for local and export\r\ntrade.\r\n\r\nThe settler finds no difficulty in selling his wheat, as grain merchants\r\nand millers compete for it. Often sales are made before the crop is\r\nripe. The large wheat merchants and shippers have their agents in every\r\ntown, and these men visit the farms, inspect the grain, and make an\r\noffer according to the ruling market price. The local millers are also\r\ncompeting for what grain they want for local consumption. The grower is\r\npaid on delivery at the mill or the nearest railway station. If he\r\nprefers to do so he can store it with the buying firms, giving them the\r\nright to purchase when he is prepared to sell, or he can store on the\r\nfarm. The export values of wheat per bushel for the last six years, have\r\nbeen:--\r\n\r\n\r\n     1909     $1.00\r\n     1910      1.00\r\n     1911      0.84\r\n     1912      0.95\r\n     1913      0.84\r\n     1914      0.82\r\n\r\n\r\nWheat is bought and sold on what is known as the f.a.q. (fair average\r\nquality) system. Samples of wheat are taken from the various districts\r\nby the different Chambers of Commerce, and each State fixes its own\r\nf.a.q. standard. These samples are mixed together, and by careful\r\ntesting on a patent scale it is ascertained what an Imperial bushel of\r\nweight actually weighs. The idea is to ascertain as equitably as\r\npossible what a fair average sample of the season's wheat should weigh.\r\nThe standard varies a little in different years; it may be 61, 62, 64,\r\nor as low as 58 lbs. to the bushel. Whatever it is fixed at for the\r\nseason that is the basis upon which all sales are made. If the market\r\nprice for wheat, for instance, is $1.20 per bushel, it is for wheat up\r\nto the f.a.q. standard. Say the latter has been fixed at 62 lbs., the\r\nwheat must show that weight. Agents have what is called a chrondrometer\r\nfor the purpose of testing the wheat. If it is below the f.a.q.\r\nstandard, a lower price is given. This system has been devised to suit\r\nthe export trade. Samples of the standard wheat are sent to markets\r\nabroad, and all cargoes are sold on that basis. When they arrive at the\r\nmarket abroad they must test up to the f.a.q. standard. This system has\r\nbeen in force in Australia for nearly half a century.\r\n\r\nIt must be understood that this standard f.a.q. weight has nothing to do\r\nwith the quantity for which the grower is paid. He is always paid on the\r\nImperial bushel basis, 60 lbs. Whatever the standard may be, every 60\r\nlbs. of wheat is a bushel. The f.a.q. weight is a standard for quality,\r\nnot quantity.\r\n\r\nThere is always a market for Australian wheat, and the price is always\r\nequal to what wheat is bringing in the world's main markets. Australian\r\nwheat has a character of its own, and a character that is improving.\r\nBritish millers want it on account of the large amount of flour it\r\nproduces, and the colour and bloom it gives to their product. The grain\r\nis usually bright and clear in texture and rich in gluten, having fine\r\nmilling qualities. Of late years Australian wheats have been\r\nconsiderably improved in strength, and this factor is continuing, and\r\nthey undoubtedly promise to more than equal any wheat produced,\r\npossessing not only colour and bloom, but also strength, and giving the\r\nmiller what he wants to produce an ideal article.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FARMERS IN AUSTRALIA ARE NOT HARASSED BY HIGH RAIL\r\nFREIGHTS.]\r\n\r\n\r\nCOST OF PRODUCING WHEAT.\r\n\r\nThe cost of production of wheat is a most important matter to the\r\ngrower. As already stated, the comparatively low yields in Australia are\r\namply compensated for by the low cost of producing wheat.\r\n\r\nIn regard to the work on the farm, the following figures are\r\napproximately the prices for different classes of work when it is done\r\nby contract:--Ploughing new ground, $1.68 per acre; old or fallowed\r\nground, $1.45 per acre; harrowing, 18 cents to 24 cents per acre;\r\ncultivating, $0.50 per acre; drilling, 36 cents per acre; harvesting\r\nwith stripper-harvester, 72 cents per acre; cutting with binder, 84\r\ncents per acre; stooking, 24 cents per acre; carting and stacking hay,\r\n$1.35 per acre.\r\n\r\nSuperphosphate is the main fertiliser used. Australian wheat soils are\r\nnaturally strong in nitrogen and potash, but in many cases are deficient\r\nin available phosphoric acid. Superphosphate costs about $1.20 per cwt.,\r\nand may be reckoned at 48 cents to 60 cents per acre. Seed wheat runs\r\nfrom 96 cents to $1.20 per bushel; sowing 45 lbs. to the acre represents\r\n72 cents to 84 cents per acre.\r\n\r\nIt is reckoned that if the same work is done by weekly-paid labour the\r\ncost is reduced by fully 30 per cent. all round.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HARVESTING SCENE, DARLING DOWNS, QUEENSLAND]\r\n\r\nIn common practice it is considered that it costs $4.80 to $6.00 per\r\nacre to put in and take off an acre of wheat. The following figures are\r\nreliable estimates of the actual cost of production by official experts,\r\nand also actual figures supplied by working farmers.\r\n\r\nIn the following estimate of the cost of producing wheat it is assumed\r\nthat the land is fallowed, and the estimate is based on a yield of 20\r\nbushels per acre:--\r\n\r\n\r\n     Ploughing once at $1.45 per acre                 $1.45\r\n\r\n     Harrowing three times at 18 cents per acre        0.54\r\n\r\n     Cultivating once at $0.60 per acre                0.60\r\n\r\n     Drilling at 36 cents per acre                     0.36\r\n\r\n     Seed, 45 lbs., at 80 cents per bushel             0.72\r\n\r\n     Pickling seed                                     0.06\r\n\r\n     Superphosphate, 1/2 cwt. at $1.20                 0.60\r\n\r\n     Harvesting with harvester at 72 cents per acre    0.72\r\n\r\n     Seven bags at $1.60 per dozen                     0.84\r\n                                                      -----\r\n                                                      $4.89\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE STRIPPER AT WORK.]\r\n\r\nIf the land is not fallowed and the seed sown immediately after\r\nploughing, the cost is correspondingly less. The above figures are the\r\ncost if the work is done on contract. If it is done by weekly hired\r\nlabour the work comes out about 30 per cent. cheaper, as will be seen by\r\nthe following figures:--\r\n\r\n\r\n     Ploughing: Wages, one man at $6.00 per week; man's rations, $2.40\r\n     per week; feed for four horses for week, $9.60; total, $18.00. One\r\n     man with four horses in a three-furrow plough will do 22 acres in\r\n     six days at a cost of less than $0.84 per acre. Drilling: Man's\r\n     wages, $6.00; rations, $2.40; horsefeed, three horses, $7.20;\r\n     total, $7.80. He will drill 90 acres in six days at that cost, or\r\n     less than $0.18 per acre. Other operations cost similarly less, but\r\n     in all cases wear and depreciation of plant and interest on capital\r\n     invested in plant should be allowed for.\r\n\r\n\r\nThese figures, however, concern cases where labour is employed. The\r\nfollowing figures show the outlay where a man is doing the work himself.\r\nHe could plough, cultivate, and sow 250 acres, which would take him\r\ntwenty-two weeks. The first year he has to purchase his seed wheat and\r\nfeed for his horses:--\r\n\r\n     190 bushels seed wheat at $0.80 per bushel     $153.60\r\n\r\n     10 tons chaff at $19.20 per ton                 192.00\r\n                                                    -------\r\n                                                    $345.60\r\n\r\n     Approximately $1.38 per acre.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt harvest time he would first reap portion of his crop to secure a\r\nsupply of horse feed for the following year, say, 10 acres:--\r\n\r\n\r\n     Reaping and haymaking, 2 men's wages for\r\n       three days at $1.92, food $0.48 per day       $14.40\r\n\r\n     Twine (for binding the sheaves)                   6.00\r\n\r\n     Harvesting the wheat crop: One man's wages\r\n       $1.92, food $0.48 per day for forty days       96.00\r\n\r\n     One hundred dozen bags at $1.68 per dozen       168.00\r\n\r\n     Horsefeed, 5 tons chaff at $19.20 per ton        96.00\r\n\r\n     Cartage, 1000 bags wheat at $0.18 per bag       180.00\r\n                                                    -------\r\n                                                    $560.40\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is reckoning the crop as averaging 15 bushels per acre, when the\r\nreturns would be:--\r\n\r\n\r\n     15 tons of chaff (a low estimate) at $19.20\r\n       per ton                                      $288.00\r\n\r\n     1200 bags of wheat, 3600 bushels at $0.80 per\r\n       bushel                                       2880.00\r\n                                                   --------\r\n                                                   $3168.00\r\n\r\n     Less expenditure ($345.60, $560.40)             906.00\r\n                                                   --------\r\n         Balance                                   $2262.00\r\n\r\n\r\nTo be thoroughly correct we should allow for:--\r\n\r\n\r\n     Interest on plant, costing, say, $1920.00 at\r\n       5 per cent.                                  $96.00\r\n\r\n     Depreciation of plant, 10 per cent.            192.00\r\n\r\n     Rent on 250 acres at $1.20 per acre            300.00\r\n                                                   -------\r\n           Total                                   $588.00\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd in addition allow for the value of the farmer's own labour:--\r\n\r\n\r\n     Twenty-two weeks putting in crop at $12.00\r\n       per week                                   $264.00\r\n\r\n     Ten weeks harvesting at $14.40 per week ..    144.00\r\n                                                  -------\r\n                                                  $408.00\r\n\r\n\r\nWe still have a satisfactory result, viz.:--\r\n\r\n\r\n      Returns                                      $3168.00\r\n\r\n      Outlay                              $570.00\r\n\r\n      Interest, &c.                        588.00\r\n\r\n      Farmer's labour                      408.00\r\n                                          -------   1902.00\r\n                                                   --------\r\n            Net clear return                       $1266.00\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom this it can be seen that very handsome returns can be obtained\r\nwhere the farmer is working his land properly, and growing a good\r\nportion, if not all, of his crop on fallowed land. Then his average\r\nwould be nearer 25 bushels than 15, and his net return nearly as much\r\nagain. In the above example, after making full allowance for all\r\nlegitimate charges, the cost of producing a 15-bushel crop from 250\r\nacres comes out at about $7.44 per acre.\r\n\r\n\r\nSHARE FARMING.\r\n\r\nOne of the most prominent and, in a sense, unique features of\r\nwheatgrowing in Australia is the share-farming system. In New South\r\nWales, for instance, something like one-sixth of the wheat crop is put\r\nin on shares. Under this system the landowner and the worker with\r\nlimited means co-operate to their mutual benefit. One provides the land\r\nand the other the labour, and, under certain conditions, they share the\r\nproduce. Since it was introduced many years ago, share farming has\r\nbecome popular because it has proved a boon to both parties and to the\r\ndifferent States, while providing an exceptionally safe means of giving\r\nmen the opportunity to ultimately acquire farms of their own.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WHEAT AT COUNTRY RAILWAY SIDING.]\r\n\r\nThe conditions upon which land is worked on shares differs slightly in\r\ndifferent districts, but usually they are somewhat on the following\r\nlines. The landowner provides the land ready for the plough, fenced and\r\ncleared; the seed wheat, and bluestone for pickling same; bags and twine\r\nfor his share of the crop. The share farmer usually provides machinery\r\nand horses to work the land, put in and take off the crop, all labour\r\nand bags and twine for his share of the crop. In the majority of cases\r\nthe landowner and the share farmer each take half the proceeds, or \"bag\r\nfor bag,\" each reserving the right to dispose of his share when and\r\nwhere he deems fit. In some cases the agreement is more liberal to the\r\nshare farmer, and a fixed amount--perhaps 16 to 18 bushels--is agreed\r\nupon, which is shared equally, any balance being taken by the farmer.\r\nThis is sometimes adopted as an incentive to good farming, and in cases\r\nas an inducement to attract the share farmer into new districts some\r\ndistance from the railway. There have been cases where farmers have\r\nsecured very good crops, 30 to 36 bushels to the acre, which meant that\r\nthey received 22 and 28 bushels per acre for their share, while the\r\nlandowner only received 8 bushels. These are exceptional conditions. As\r\nstated, the usual practice is to share equally. The following are sample\r\nspecimens of the different agreements worked under:--\r\n\r\n\r\n     The landowner finds the land, all seed, and half manure; the farmer\r\n     finds plant, labour, and half manure. Each takes half the crop.\r\n\r\n     The landowner provides land, all seed and all manure; the farmer\r\n     plant and labour, and takes one-third of the crop, the landowner\r\n     taking two-thirds.\r\n\r\n     The landowner provides land only, and takes one-third of the crop;\r\n     the farmer provides plant, labour, seed, and manure, taking\r\n     two-thirds of the crop.\r\n\r\n     The landowner provides all stock, land, and half manure; the farmer\r\n     provides labour, seed, and half manure, and the crop is divided\r\n     equally.\r\n\r\n     The landowner provides land, seed, and manure; the farmer does all\r\n     the work, and the crop is equally divided.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A NICE MIXED FARM.]\r\n\r\nIt will thus be seen that some minor differences occur in the\r\nagreements. The first of the above list is most common. There are cases,\r\nhowever, where a progressive owner is anxious to get his land under\r\nwheat, and has financed the farmer, finding everything but labour. The\r\nlandowner has provided a working plant, for which the farmer pays him\r\nfrom the proceeds of the crops, the payments extending over a term of\r\nseasons. Under this system men have started without any capital, and in\r\na few years possessed a plant worth several hundred pounds, together\r\nwith a snug banking account to their credit. Of course, in such cases\r\nthe landowner knows his man, and knows he is honest, experienced, and\r\ncapable. Usually the men have worked on the place as farm hands.\r\n\r\nUnder any conditions it is essential that the share farmer must have\r\ncertain qualifications. It could not be expected that the landowner\r\nwould consent to allow him to work valuable land otherwise. Practical\r\nexperience of wheatgrowing is required, together with a good personal\r\ncharacter. Local experience is also usually required, and in any case it\r\nwould be the wisest course for any man to secure in his own interests\r\nsuch experience before endeavouring to start farming on shares. In\r\nAustralia the man who is in earnest, and determined to go on the land,\r\nwill find no difficulty in obtaining such experience. There is a good\r\ndemand for willing farm workers at a rate of wages that will allow a\r\nthrifty man to put something by, while he is gaining a practical\r\nexperience and a knowledge of local conditions. Once he has those he\r\nwill not find it difficult to obtain the chance to start working on\r\nshares.\r\n\r\nThe share farmer has to find his own dwelling, and support himself and\r\nfamily. In some cases the owner erects the dwellings under special\r\nterms, but usually, as the farmer hopes to only be engaged for a few\r\nseasons share farming, the building is of a cheap nature, as the climate\r\nis temperate.\r\n\r\nA man with $1440.00 or $1920.00 can purchase horses and obtain a plant,\r\nfinancing himself for a couple of years without depending too much on\r\ncredit. Men have started with less and succeeded, as examples given\r\nlater will show. It is not necessary to purchase a complete plant, and,\r\nas already stated, the more expensive implements can be purchased on\r\nterms. A man can handle 200 to 300 acres, and at the ruling prices for\r\nwheat of recent years, taking the average obtained by good farmers, the\r\nreturns will run from $9.60 to $14.00 per acre and more for his share.\r\nIn addition, after ploughing and sowing is completed, a team of horses\r\nwill earn good money at contract work in the district, carrying on the\r\nroads and so on, until harvest time. In this way a farmer in three or\r\nfour years, perhaps less, will be in the position to take up land on his\r\nown account on a private or Government subdivision, and start in to\r\nbuild a permanent and comfortable home for himself and his family.\r\n\r\nWhile share farming he has proved his capability and obtained the\r\nconfidence that comes with experience, together with a valuable\r\nknowledge of local conditions, which is a great help in selecting land\r\nfor purchase.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen that share farming affords exceptional opportunities for\r\nthe energetic man with a small capital. He can start without sinking\r\nall his capital in rent or purchase money, and perhaps burdening himself\r\nwith a heavy debt. In his own interests he has that to farm well, and\r\nindeed in most cases the terms of the agreement require conditions\r\nessential to good farming. Farmers are usually required to plough to a\r\nspecified depth, and at times to prepare an area of fallow land for the\r\nsucceeding crop. He is allowed to graze his horses on the property, or\r\ngiven the use of a paddock at a low rental.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THIS CROP YIELDED OVER 30 BUSHELS TO THE ACRE.]\r\n\r\nOne of the advantages of share farming, making towards amicable working,\r\nis that the interests of the landowner and the farmer are the same. Both\r\nare anxious to secure the greatest possible return from the land, and\r\nthere is a direct community of interest. The landowner may be more\r\nconcerned about maintaining the fertility of the soil, and securing good\r\nfarming, but this is also to the interest of the farmer, and certainly\r\naffords him a valuable lesson for the future when he is working his own\r\nproperty. While the system beyond question is equitable and fair, and\r\ngives the farmer an excellent chance to achieve success that would not\r\nbe the case where he was working on wages, or an ordinary tenant,\r\nadmittedly it is also advantageous to the landowner. He secures a good\r\nreturn from his land, and avoids the anxiety and trouble often\r\nassociated with the employment of labour on a large scale, while he has\r\nnot to embark a large sum of money in working plant.\r\n\r\nIn connection with a system such as this the evidence of an unbiassed,\r\nindependent outside body is, perhaps, more convincing than anything\r\nelse. It is available.\r\n\r\nIn 1910 Australia was visited by the Scottish Agricultural Commission, a\r\nbody of practical men from Scotland, who investigated rural conditions\r\nin the Commonwealth. The Commission toured the Commonwealth, visiting\r\ndifferent wheat districts, and came into direct touch with local\r\nconditions. They paid great attention to the share farming, as its\r\npossibilities could not fail to impress them, and in their report on\r\n\"Australia: Its Land, Conditions, and Prospects,\" they had the following\r\nto say:--\r\n\r\n\r\n     \"After a year or two the newcomer finds himself ready for a start\r\n     on his own account. If he possessed a few hundred pounds when he\r\n     landed, he will now seek to become his own landlord in one or other\r\n     of the ways open to him. If, however, he has yet too little money\r\n     for that, he will be well advised to take no risks, but to be\r\n     content meantime either with renting a farm or with farming on the\r\n     share system. A man who is intelligent and industrious, who has had\r\n     sufficient experience of farming in Australia, but who has not\r\n     enough money to buy land, cannot do better than turn his attention\r\n     to farming on shares.\r\n\r\n     \"He can take up wheatfarming ... and if he has a good reputation,\r\n     he will find no difficulty in getting on shares the kind of farm he\r\n     wants.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW THE SETTLER IS ASSISTED.\r\n\r\nThe different Australian States fully recognise the great value to the\r\ncommunity of the farmer, and special steps are taken to assist him in\r\ndifferent ways.\r\n\r\nFinancial assistance is rendered through agricultural banks in West\r\nAustralia and Queensland, the Credit Foncier in Victoria, and State\r\nBanks in New South Wales and South Australia. Through these Government\r\ninstitutions advances are made to settlers. Full particulars in this\r\nregard are furnished in another booklet, obtainable by intending\r\nsettlers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FARMERS ON THE WAY TO A COUNTRY SHOW.]\r\n\r\nIn Australia all the railways are State-owned, and the endeavour is to\r\ncarry farm produce and farming implements, fertilisers, &c., at the\r\nlowest possible rate compatible with the railways covering working\r\nexpenses and depreciation of stock. Special rates are made for long\r\ndistances. The rates vary in the different States, but it can be\r\nconfidently said that they prove no hindrance to successful\r\nwheatgrowing. As all the wheat grown in Australia has to be carried to\r\nthe seaboard on the railways, the particulars of success achieved, as\r\nalready given, proves that. The Commonwealth Statistician furnishes the\r\nfollowing particulars of State railway rates for agricultural produce in\r\nthe different States, which serve as a guide to the settler:--\r\n\r\n\r\n     +------------------+-------------------------------------+\r\n     |                  |Charge per Ton in                    |\r\n     |                  |truckloads for a haul of             |\r\n     |      State.      +-----------+------------+------------+\r\n     |                  | 50 miles. | 100 miles. | 200 miles. |\r\n     +------------------+-----------+------------+------------+\r\n     |                  |     $     |      $     |      $     |\r\n     |New South Wales   |   1.20    |    1.80    |    2.28    |\r\n     |Victoria          |   1.32    |    2.04    |    2.52    |\r\n     |Queensland        |   1.10    |    2.10    |    2.64    |\r\n     |South Australia   |   1.48    |    2.10    |    3.10    |\r\n     |Western Australia |   1.50    |    2.14    |    2.90    |\r\n     |Tasmania          |   1.62    |    2.32    |    3.12    |\r\n     +------------------+-----------+------------+------------+\r\n     |Average           |   1.36    |    2.08    |    2.76    |\r\n     +------------------+-----------+------------+------------+\r\n\r\n     +------------------+-------------------------------------+\r\n     |                  |Charge per Ton in                    |\r\n     |                  |truckloads for a haul of             |\r\n     |       State.     +-----------+------------+------------\r\n     |                  | 300 miles. | 400 miles. | 500 miles.|\r\n     +------------------+------------+------------+-----------+\r\n     |                  |      $     |      $     |      $    |\r\n     |New South Wales   |    2.52    |    2.72    |    2.88   |\r\n     |Victoria          |    2.96    |    3.36    |    3.76   |\r\n     |Queensland        |    2.88    |    3.12    |    3.36   |\r\n     |South Australia   |    4.10    |    5.10    |    6.10   |\r\n     |Western Australia |    4.08    |    5.28    |    5.76   |\r\n     |Tasmania          |     ...    |     ...    |     ...   |\r\n     +------------------+------------+------------+-----------+\r\n     |Average           |    3.10    |    3.90    |    4.38   |\r\n     +------------------+------------+------------+-----------+\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following table shows the rates on low-class freight, which includes\r\nordinary articles of merchandise, such as are particularly identified or\r\nconnected with the primary industries:--\r\n\r\n\r\n     +------------------+-----------+------------+------------+\r\n     |                  |      Charge per Ton for haul of     |\r\n     |     State.       +-----------+------------+------------+\r\n     |                  | 50 miles. | 100 miles. | 200 miles. |\r\n     +------------------+-----------+------------+------------+\r\n     |                  |     $     |      $     |      $     |\r\n     |New South Wales   |   0.60    |    0.86    |    1.36    |\r\n     |Victoria          |   1.02    |    1.60    |    2.40    |\r\n     |Queensland        |   1.10    |    2.10    |    3.60    |\r\n     |South Australia   |   1.00    |    1.84    |    3.26    |\r\n     |Western Australia |   1.20    |    2.00    |    3.40    |\r\n     |Tasmania          |   1.20    |    1.62    |    2.04    |\r\n     +------------------+-----------+------------+------------+\r\n     |Average           |   1.00    |    1.64    |    2.86    |\r\n     +------------------+-----------+------------+------------+\r\n\r\n     +------------------+------------+------------+------------+\r\n     |                  |      Charge per Ton for haul of      |\r\n     |     State.       +------------+------------+------------+\r\n     |                  | 300 miles. | 400 miles. | 500 miles. |\r\n     +------------------+------------+------------+------------+\r\n     |                  |      $     |      $     |      $     |\r\n     |New South Wales   |    1.86    |    2.36    |    2.86    |\r\n     |Victoria          |    2.84    |    3.24    |    3.64    |\r\n     |Queensland        |    4.40    |    5.60    |    5.60    |\r\n     |South Australia   |    4.26    |    5.26    |    6.26    |\r\n     |Western Australia |    4.40    |    5.60    |    6.60    |\r\n     |Tasmania          |     ...    |     ...    |     ...    |\r\n     +------------------+------------+------------+------------+\r\n     |Average           |    3.62    |    4.42    |    5.48    |\r\n     +------------------+------------+------------+------------+\r\n\r\n\r\nThe railways being publicly owned, there is always a demand for a\r\nreduction of rates when they show any undue profit over working\r\nexpenses. The object of railway administration is to assist the\r\nproducer.\r\n\r\nThe oversea trade of Australia runs into enormous figures, amounting in\r\n1913 to $759,422,400.00. Extensive shipping facilities are available,\r\nand the producer has cheap and constant access to the world's markets.\r\nThe Australian wheatgrower is practically able to compete on equal terms\r\nin this regard with the farmer in the North and Midland counties of\r\nEngland.\r\n\r\nThe postal, telegraphic, and telephonic services are also State\r\nconcerns. There is a universal penny post throughout Australia,\r\ntelegrams are conveyed at cheap rates, and special facilities are\r\nprovided for groups of neighbouring farmers to secure a united telephone\r\nservice. The farmer is able to keep in close touch with the world's\r\nmarkets through these means.\r\n\r\nThe Departments of Agriculture in the different States have, of course,\r\nbeen created to advance the interests of the farming community. They are\r\nlarge and important departments, well equipped, and have proved of great\r\npractical value. Wheatgrowing being the most important crop in\r\nAustralia, the industry receives special attention, and scientific\r\ninvestigation and experiment is being constantly made, and the results\r\ncommunicated to the wheatgrowers.\r\n\r\nAgricultural colleges, where accommodation is provided for students, who\r\nare given theoretical and practical instruction in different branches of\r\nfarming; experiment farms, where students are also trained;\r\ndemonstration farms; and farmers' experiment plots are conducted by the\r\nDepartments of Agriculture. Wheatbreeding and pathological and\r\nbacteriological work is carried on, and expert instructors work in the\r\nfield assisting the farmer in every possible way. Bulletins dealing with\r\ndifferent phases of work on the wheat farm, giving the results of\r\nexperiments made, lists of varieties of wheat to plant and when to plant\r\nthem, are issued in large numbers, and either given to the farmer free\r\nor sold at a nominal price. Agricultural gazettes and journals are also\r\nissued monthly, while topical information is made public through the\r\ncolumns of the press, which in Australia devotes an unusual amount of\r\nspace regularly to rural topics.\r\n\r\nIn New South Wales wheat experiments are conducted at the Cowra\r\nExperiment Farm, which is the headquarters, and at the Hawkesbury\r\nAgricultural College, and Wagga, Bathurst, Glen Innes, Nyngan, and Yanco\r\nFarms. At Nyngan tests are made with a view to determining the\r\nsuitability of the different varieties for cultivation in dry areas. The\r\nwork at each farm consists of:--Pedigree plots of the main varieties\r\ngrown on the farms; crossbreds in course of fixation for local\r\nconditions of soil and climate; a \"stud variety trial,\" including all\r\nstandard varieties, newly-introduced wheats, and samples sent for\r\nidentification; \"stud bulks\" to provide seed for planting the farm areas\r\nwhich supply seed wheat for sale.\r\n\r\nSince 1897 the Government agricultural experts have been endeavouring to\r\ndetermine the varieties of wheats most suitable for different districts,\r\nand to secure new types which return the best milling results locally,\r\nand their efforts have been very successful. In this connection the work\r\nof the late William Farrer, wheat experimentalist of the Department of\r\nAgriculture, New South Wales, has become world famous. His efforts were\r\ndirected to the production of new varieties of greater milling value and\r\nmore rust-resistant. Farrer's wheats, which rank among the most prolific\r\ngrain varieties, are largely cultivated in Australia. Farrer's work is\r\nstill carried on, and it has been proved that Australia can produce\r\nstrong white wheat equal in flour production to the old varieties, and\r\nequal in strength to the famed standard Manitoba wheat. Australian wheat\r\nis eagerly sought after by British millers.\r\n\r\nFarrer's work has been of direct and material value to the wheatgrowers,\r\nand his memory is held high in Australia. Prior to the introduction into\r\nthe wheatgrowing areas of his crossbred wheats, growers depended mostly\r\nupon Purple Straw varieties. Hardly any varieties were known, and little\r\nattention was paid to the advisability of sowing certain varieties\r\neither early or late in the season. The advent of these new varieties\r\nhas brought about a great change. Such an extensive range is provided\r\nthat farmers can begin their sowing much earlier, and finish with other\r\nvarieties much later than was the case before. The sowing season has\r\nbeen lengthened by more than two months. Not only is the sowing period\r\nconsiderably prolonged, but the harvesting period is prolonged also, for\r\nthe late varieties sown early mature late, those sown in mid-season are\r\nharvested in mid-season, and the early varieties which have been sown\r\nlate mature and are harvested early. Thus instead of the whole crop\r\nbecoming ripe at the one time it ripens in stages, and is harvested\r\naccordingly. Such a system has immense advantages over the old days,\r\nwhen practically the whole crop ripened at once.\r\n\r\nThe foremost variety bred by William Farrer is \"Federation,\" which has\r\nbecome a general favourite in New South Wales, Victoria, and South\r\nAustralia. This variety is a very heavy yielder, has good\r\ndrought-resistant qualities, and withstands wind and weather so well\r\nthat it may be said to be storm-proof. It would require a storm of\r\nexceptional violence to either cause the crop to lodge or the ear to\r\nshed its grain. Consequently it is most popular with growers, and a very\r\nlarge proportion of the wheat area is sown with this variety. It is\r\nestimated that in New South Wales and Victoria alone the increased value\r\nin yield obtained from this variety is worth over $2,880,000.00 annually\r\nto the growers. It is estimated that the yield of Federation is at least\r\n3 bushels more per acre than the next best yielding variety in New South\r\nWales.\r\n\r\nOther of Farrer's wheats have been singularly successful, as an instance\r\n\"Bunyip,\" which can be sown safely a month later than was the case with\r\nany variety previously. It must be recognised that the result of such\r\nexperimental work is of great value to the grower.\r\n\r\nNew wheat varieties are bred at the experimental farms, and thoroughly\r\ntested and proved before they are put out to the farmer. In New South\r\nWales they are then grown on farmer's experimental plots. The State is\r\ndivided into divisions, and in each an inspector supervises the sowing\r\nand cultivation of these plots, which are situated on private farms by\r\nspecial arrangement, the farmer carrying out the work and the department\r\nfinding seed, manure, and supervision, usually near the roadside, where\r\nthe plots can be seen by district farmers and progress noted. The\r\ninspector advises growers generally, while the plots are a silent\r\nteacher all the time. They have proved a valuable medium of practical\r\neducation amongst the farming community, special attention being given\r\nto cultural methods. In 1911-12 plots were cultivated in New South\r\nWales in eighty-three districts. In 1911 there were seventy-two farmers'\r\nplots in Victoria on which manurial and variety wheat trials were\r\nconducted.\r\n\r\nIn the latter State, however, a change has been made, and the majority\r\nof these plots have been discontinued, and a commencement made towards a\r\npolicy of concentration in experimental investigation. It was decided to\r\nestablish a Central Research Farm at Werribee, on which the initiative\r\nwith regard to all experimental and research work is undertaken, while\r\nother State farms and the Agricultural College will be used as district\r\nexperiment stations. The work at the Central Research Farm is intended\r\nto confer on agriculture the benefits of the most scientific advances by\r\nthe prosecution of investigations and trials under practical and\r\naccurately-recorded conditions concerning problems involved in\r\nincreasing the agricultural output. Attention will be given to\r\nimprovement of wheat, soil renovation, fertilising and tillage methods,\r\nrotation of crops, &c. The farm is within 18 miles of the capital city,\r\nMelbourne, and is easy of access by farmers from all parts of the State.\r\nMuch of the soil closely resembles in physical character and chemical\r\nanalysis that of the principal wheatgrowing districts. At Longerenong\r\nAgricultural College and the Rutherglen Viticultural College attention\r\nis given to the improvement of wheat by systematic selection,\r\ncrossbreeding and hybridisation in one case, and the fixation and\r\ntesting of new crossbred wheats in the other.\r\n\r\nSouth Australia also has its Government Agricultural College, where\r\nextensive wheat experiments are conducted. The college has been of the\r\ngreatest benefit to the farming community. In that State there are\r\nseveral demonstration and experiment farms established by the State,\r\nincluding the Parafield Wheat Research Station, 170 acres in extent,\r\nwhich is set apart for the raising of high-grade seed wheat for\r\ndistribution amongst growers, and the raising of new varieties of wheat\r\nby crossbreeding and selection.\r\n\r\nIn Western Australia several State farms were established for the\r\npurpose of demonstrating the possibilities of farming on up-to-date\r\nprinciples in the different districts. Having achieved that object as\r\nfar as pioneering work is concerned, they are now maintained as\r\nexperiment stations for the production of purebred cereals, &c. At\r\nNarrogin State Farm students are accepted for instruction in practical\r\nagriculture.\r\n\r\nQueensland has its Agricultural College and State Farms. Although the\r\narea under wheat has not yet attained large dimensions in that State,\r\nprincipally because stockraising proves so profitable, good average\r\nyields are obtained as compared with the other States, and considerable\r\nscientific attention is being devoted to wheat culture. At the Roma\r\nState Farm and Hermitage State Farm extensive wheat experiments are\r\ncarried out in the way of manurial trials, variety tests, and methods of\r\ntillage. The greater portion of the State Farm, Hermitage, is devoted to\r\nthe production of seed wheat true to type, thus making available a\r\nsupply of tested seed for the growers.\r\n\r\nAgricultural High Schools are also established in some States, and\r\nagricultural teaching and agricultural education extends from the\r\nclasses in the State Public Schools, through the High Schools,\r\nAgricultural Colleges, and finally the University.\r\n\r\nAgricultural Societies exist in practically every farming district in\r\nAustralia. They are usually subsidised by the various State Governments,\r\nand conduct annual agricultural shows, which are a source of education\r\nand social entertainment. They are the leading functions in the\r\ndifferent country districts. Usually experts from the Departments of\r\nAgriculture attend these shows--at times a special exhibit is made by\r\nthe State Experimental Farms--and lecture on agriculture. In the capital\r\ncities Royal Agricultural Societies hold annual shows, which are\r\nmagnificent exemplifications of the resources of the States and the\r\nprogress in agriculture. Wheat competitions are naturally a strong\r\nfeature of these exhibitions.\r\n\r\nSouth Australia led the way in the formation of an Agricultural Bureau,\r\nwhich has branches throughout the country districts. The members meet\r\nregularly, and discuss farming subjects, are periodically addressed by\r\nofficers of the Department of Agriculture, and also hold an annual\r\nconference. The bureau has proved a valuable means of education, as it\r\nbrings the farmers together, and engenders a spirit of co-operation and\r\nmutual assistance. In New South Wales an Agricultural Bureau was formed\r\nwithin recent years, and is now well established, having nearly 100\r\nbranches. Farmers' unions and associations are also powerful bodies in\r\nAustralia, exercising both an educational and political influence.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOCIAL LIFE IN AUSTRALIA.\r\n\r\nAustralia is essentially a \"White Man's Country.\" Over 90 per cent. of\r\nthe total population of 4,872,059 people are of British descent. The\r\npeople are free and democratic, and their laws progressive and advanced;\r\nin industrial and social legislation Australia leads the world. It is\r\nessentially a peaceful country, and so far has been blessed by never\r\nhaving war within its boundaries. Respect for the law, and absence of\r\nviolent crime is a marked feature of life in the Commonwealth. In the\r\ncountry districts crime is practically unknown, and it is common for\r\nhouses to be left unguarded, and locked doors are rare. The people are\r\nkindly and hospitable, and there is very little class distinction. In\r\nits place is an equality of opportunity that opens all avenues to those\r\nwith ambition. Working men and their sons frequently rise to the highest\r\npositions the States have to offer, and such an occurrence is so common\r\nas to fail to arouse any comment. In politics there is a universal\r\nsuffrage, every man and woman having a voice in the government of the\r\ncountry, therefore the laws are framed for the good of the majority. No\r\nland offers better or freer social conditions to the homemaker.\r\nAdvantages offer not only to the settler himself, but he has every\r\nreason to hope for a happy destiny for his children.\r\n\r\nAs has been stated, the climate is exceptionally healthy and mild. The\r\ndry atmosphere, long hours of sunshine and open-air life tend to health\r\nand happiness. Indeed it is no exaggeration to say that the fertility of\r\nthe soil and the congenial climate has greatly lead to easy-going\r\nmethods of farming, which are not altogether in the interests of the\r\ncountry. Few countries could carry on their rural industries with\r\nsimilar easy methods; none would leave the people as prosperous as the\r\npeople of Australia.\r\n\r\nThe information already given shows that the wheatfarmer, except in the\r\nmost isolated districts, has the facilities for educating his children\r\nat little or no cost. Living is cheap on the farm. In most parts of the\r\nwheat belt fruit grows luxuriantly, and within three or four years a few\r\ntrees will provide the settler with sufficient fresh fruit for home\r\nconsumption, and to make jam and preserves for the family use.\r\nVegetables can be grown during the greater part of the year, and\r\nthroughout the twelve months if there is an ample water supply. Ideal\r\nsettlers' homes are to be met with in all districts--a weatherboard or\r\nbrick cottage, comfortable and roomy, with wide verandahs, covered with\r\ncreeping grape or passion fruit vines, a few beds of brilliant flowers,\r\na vegetable patch, and an acre or so of fruit trees. Many wheatgrowers\r\ncombine fruitraising or poultry-keeping with wheatgrowing; some, in\r\nsuitable districts, find great profit in cultivating a vineyard. These\r\ndevelopments depend upon the man and his capability and tendencies, and\r\nupon the co-operation and talents of his wife.\r\n\r\nFor his meat supply the farmer usually depends upon his own flock of\r\nkilling sheep, varied with beef or bacon procured from the township. If\r\nhe is within 10 miles of the township he will obtain his bread supply\r\nfrom the local baker, although, of course, many housewives do their own\r\nbaking. In the country districts, however, bread and stores are\r\ndelivered long distances, 20 miles and more.\r\n\r\nThe smallest country town has its church, school, post and telegraph\r\noffice, bank, savings bank, stores, blacksmith's shop, hotel, and so on.\r\nThere is usually a School of Arts, with a circulating library.\r\n\r\nThe country districts enjoy a system of local government, and the farmer\r\nelects the councillors who manage local affairs.\r\n\r\nHe has his annual show, usually an annual race meeting. There are\r\nfootball and cricket clubs for his boys. Open-air sports are popular in\r\nthe country districts of Australia, and are a splendid means of bringing\r\nthe young fellows together.\r\n\r\nThe Agricultural Bureau or Farmers' Associations' meetings provide\r\nintercourse with other men on the land. Farmers' picnics or carnivals\r\nare an annual function in many places.\r\n\r\nWithin 2, 3, or 4 miles away, according to the size of his farm, there\r\nare neighbouring farmers and their families. The settler is not an\r\nisolated unit in a strange land, but is living in a civilised country\r\namongst civilised progressive people, enjoying the advantages and\r\nfacilities of modern conditions, and living under a system of political\r\nand religious liberty.\r\n\r\nTo all white men Australia, with its vast tracts of untilled wheat land,\r\nholds out a welcome hand. The self-reliant man, with a small capital,\r\ncan come to Australia, confident that with energy and attention to his\r\nwork he can build up a prosperous career, and rear his children in a\r\ncontented home surrounded by health and happiness, helping in the making\r\nof a young, clean nation, part and parcel of an enlightened race.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n     _By Authority:_\r\n\r\n     McCARRON, BIRD & CO., MELBOURNE,\r\n     479 COLLINS STREET.",
