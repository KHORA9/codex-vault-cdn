In less favored localities, the drive may be long and the\r\nrelaxation short, but not so in the Connecticut Valley. Half an hour of\r\ntravel, either to the east or to the west from any large community,\r\nprovides an escape to the hills, where people, cars, houses, and all the\r\nminutiae of urban civilization are blurred on the canvas of upland and\r\nlowland.\r\n\r\nLocal pride and personal prejudice may proclaim one view superior to\r\nanother; but the praise so liberally bestowed upon the heights beyond\r\nWestfield, the Mount Tom Reservation, the land called Goshen, Shelburne\r\nSummit, and many another site, merely bespeaks the rivalry of equally\r\nfavored vantage points. Perhaps the trail to Pelham would not be singled\r\nout for special mention by the undiscriminating enthusiast, but the\r\nconnoisseur of New England's scenic beauty returns and follows it again\r\nand again. A good road may take some credit for its popularity, but\r\nthere is a deeper cause than this which brings him back; for, if there\r\nis drama in scenery, he finds it here. The road leads out of\r\nNorthampton, and from the graceful arch of the Coolidge Memorial Bridge\r\nhe views the flood-scarred lowlands that border the river, and across\r\nthe flat plain into Hadley he sees visible reminders that river and\r\nfarmer periodically struggle over ownership of the land. Then a rise in\r\nthe road constricts the view but offers a promise of something\r\ndifferent. Ahead, rolling fields stretch to the beckoning hills beyond\r\nAmherst, but the hills appear and disappear in tantalizing cadence as\r\nthe car tops each rise and drops into the ensuing hollow. Soon West\r\nPelham comes into view, and the rise to the highland begins. Beside the\r\nroad a brook tumbles into the valley; and as the car climbs the heights\r\nto Pelham, and miles of wooded land are suddenly spread before the eye,\r\nthe wayfarer realizes that here is the dramatic climax to his trip and\r\nto the murmured story of the brook. But the long ridges reaching out to\r\nthe north and to the south, the deep valleys between them, and the sky\r\nwhich meets the farthest ridge do not enclose the panorama. It has a\r\nfourth dimension--time--a dimension as limitless as the horizon.\r\n\r\nWith just a dash of imagination, the wayfarer may journey backward\r\nthrough time; through scenes of infinite variety; through countless\r\nyears of unceasing change; through situations so different that he would\r\nscarcely have recognized his New England. The scarred plain of the\r\nriver, the brook, the soil, the rocks, the upland and the valley,--all\r\ntell a fascinating and a logical, if surprising, geological tale. A\r\ndetour down this fourth dimension promises as much interest as a journey\r\nthrough the other three.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                          Today and Yesterday\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the Coolidge Memorial Bridge the broad lowland seems to reach out\r\nin all directions towards the encircling hills. Far down the river, the\r\ndistant bank rises a sheer thirty feet from the water and is high enough\r\nto surmount even the worst of floods. Yet each year this bank recedes as\r\nthe unconsolidated sediment at its base is sapped by the stream and is\r\ncarried away. Three times the river road has been moved back from the\r\ninsatiable Connecticut, and today the main Hockanum highway takes the\r\nlong route far from the water's edge.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The River Works_\r\n\r\nNearer the bridge the land is lower, and it shows the effects of\r\nfrequent inundation, but not of scour. A great sand bar lies in the\r\ncurve of the stream, and the low parallel ridges suggest that they, too,\r\nwere awash in the Connecticut before its eastern bank encroached so far\r\nupon the town of Hadley. The tongue of land which serves as\r\nNorthampton's airport is a succession of bars and abandoned channels\r\nwhich record the migration of the river away from its old bank along\r\nBridge Street. The Connecticut is robbing Hadley to pay Northampton, but\r\nthere was a time when Northampton was pilfered, too.\r\n\r\nSwales line the landscape as far as Hadley; and each year, at the time\r\nof high water, they must now be content with the meager overflow, where\r\nonce they sped the entire stream upon its southward course. But even\r\nnow, in flood, their original function may be restored. For the swale\r\njust west of Hadley was a roaring torrent in 1938, 1936, and 1896.\r\nIndeed, it threatened to appropriate the entire stream, and each of the\r\ngreat curving hollows that furrow the lowland are scour-channels which\r\nwere made at other times.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 1. _The Connecticut River undercuts the Hadley\r\n    bank at Hockanum._]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 2. _Natural levees border the Connecticut River\r\n    south of the Sunderland Bridge._]\r\n\r\nThe river has moved at will from one side of its alluvial plain to the\r\nother, and its threats to change its course are not to be taken lightly.\r\nUntil 1830 it flowed past Northampton, around the great ox-bow to\r\nEasthampton and then back to the watergap between Mount Tom and Mount\r\nHolyoke. It served as the main line of communication to the Atlantic\r\nseaboard and was a much travelled route. In the spring of that year high\r\nwater breached the narrow neck of land between the two ends of the\r\nmeander loop, and practically overnight the route to New London was\r\nshortened by three miles. Although the event was not a source of\r\nrejoicing to the landowners, Northampton declared a day of thanksgiving\r\nbecause they were now, thanks be to Providence, three miles nearer the\r\nsea. How often the river has changed its course may never be determined,\r\nbut the floodplain is grooved with swampy or silt-filled ox-bow lakes,\r\nnot only near Northampton, but all the way from Brattleboro, Vermont, to\r\nMiddletown, Connecticut. They tell of older shifts in the course of a\r\nriver which still displays its brute power within the limits of its\r\nalluvial plain.\r\n\r\nThe inundation of 1936 did more than scour the river's floodplain; it\r\nleft thick deposits of sand and silt upon many of the fields. Each\r\npreceding flood has done the same sort of thing, dropping coarse sand in\r\ngreatest abundance on the banks where the river flowed straightest.\r\nFlood by flood, the deposit has risen higher on these favored sites,\r\nwhere the swift main current slackens as it spreads over the broad, flat\r\nplain. Today the banks form natural levees sloping away from the river\r\nat many points southward from the Sunderland Bridge.\r\n\r\nJust when the river started to shift back and forth across its alluvial\r\nplain is not revealed, but it was long before the white man penetrated\r\nthe country. Indian graves and campsites have been laid bare as the high\r\nwater of each new flood has removed the silt left during earlier\r\ninundations. The sites rarely yield any implement brought by the\r\nEuropeans; they record long years of Indian occupation in the land\r\ncalled Norwottock, a land in which the red man found a river which\r\ntemperamentally shifted its course in response to periodic floods.\r\n\r\nThe floodplain ends at a rise in the road not far east of Hadley. The\r\nrise is a scalloped embankment, reminiscent of the high bank on the\r\nriver bend downstream from Hadley; even the long narrow swamp at the\r\nbase looks like a filled ox-bow, and the scallops look like bites which\r\nthe hungry river took from its banks. This embankment continues\r\nnorthward past Mount Warner, following the present channel closely\r\nthrough North Hadley, and it passes just east of Sunderland village.\r\nCorresponding banks are present on the west side of the stream in South\r\nDeerfield and Hatfield. Within the confines of those terraces the\r\nConnecticut has had free play, but its course has never strayed east or\r\nwest of these well defined boundaries.\r\n\r\nWave-like hills of sand cap the embankments in several localities north\r\nof Hatfield and North Hadley. Some, perched on the terrace edge, were\r\npartly cut away when the river was establishing the limits of its\r\nfloodplain. Wherever the pine trees are cut down, or the grass plowed\r\nunder, the sand within these hills begins to drift. They look and act\r\nlike those hills of the desert, the sand dunes, and they record the\r\ndrift of wind-whipped sand across a naked land, before the river had\r\nestablished a floodplain within its present confines.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Landscape Changes_\r\n\r\nFine sand, silt, or clay is found beneath the windblown sand wherever\r\nthe river banks undercut the dunes. The clays are especially widespread,\r\nfor each of the numerous local brickyards has its clay pit, and there\r\nare many more clay banks which have no brickyard. The clays are\r\nrhythmically banded. One band, composed of very fine material which\r\nsettles from suspension only after weeks of absolute quiet, retains\r\nmoisture tenaciously; adjacent bands dry more rapidly, are somewhat\r\nsandy, and settle from suspension in less than a week. A large body of\r\nquiet water in which so much fine clay could settle must have occupied\r\nthe valley before the river was there, and the only type of water body\r\nwhich could have provided the proper environment is a fresh-water lake,\r\nfree from agitation during the long winter months when its surface was\r\nfrozen over. These thin clay bands are deposits of a winter season, when\r\nstreams are low and their load light. Then, even the finest particles\r\ncan settle, during the many weeks of quiet water, as a paper-thin layer\r\nupon the lake bottom. The coarser sandy layer just above the finest clay\r\nrecords the spring break-up, the melting of the ice, and resuscitated\r\nstreams flowing from the hills with a vigor that can be acquired only\r\nwhen the melt-water from the winter snow combines with the normal\r\nrun-off. The sand which these freshets bring to the lake diminishes as\r\nthe spring floods subside, and the sediment becomes progressively finer\r\nuntil next spring comes around.\r\n\r\n    Pl. 2. _Features of the landscape which originated during\r\n    comparatively recent time._\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: a. _Air view of the ox-bow lake between Northampton\r\n    and Mt. Tom._]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: b. _Roches moutonnées of the Pelham Hills seen from\r\n    Hadley._]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 3. _Block diagram showing the main features of\r\n    central Massachusetts at the present time._]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 4. _Block diagram showing the main features of\r\n    central Massachusetts during the recession of the Ice Sheet._]\r\n\r\nEach sandy layer is a spring; each clay band, a winter; and the two\r\ntogether mark the passage of a year. High spring floods are rarely\r\nlocal; floods on the Connecticut are usually matched by floods in the\r\nMerrimack watershed to the east and along Housatonic to the west. Floods\r\nof the past were much the same, and many of them can be identified\r\nreadily in the banded clays of the Connecticut Valley. Each one can be\r\ntraced in contemporaneous deposits which were formed in other parts of\r\nthe lowland and in neighboring lake basins.\r\n\r\nSome of the winter bands, together with the layers below them, are torn\r\nand folded, and the tops of the folds have been sheared off. Covering\r\nthem invariably is the sand layer of the spring break-up. Plain from\r\nthese features is a winter episode of freezing to the lake bottom, and\r\nof ice contorting the clays as it expanded and contracted in response to\r\nfluctuations in the surface temperatures. The normal cyclic repetition\r\nof sand and clay was resumed when these particularly hard winters came\r\nto an end.\r\n\r\nAt South Hadley Falls the lake clays rest upon a gravel bed, and the\r\nbottom layer records the lake's first year of life in that locality. The\r\noverlying bands provide the evidence of a characteristic climatic\r\nsequence which can also be recognized in the clays at Chicopee and at\r\nother points still farther south in the lowland. But at Chicopee there\r\nare many layers which are older than the bottom layer at South Hadley\r\nFalls; and at Springfield many layers appear that are older than the\r\nbasal band at Chicopee. From the sediment deposited in its waters, the\r\nstory of the lake is not difficult to decipher. It existed at\r\nSpringfield years before it appeared at South Hadley Falls; in fact, it\r\nflooded the meadows near Middletown, Connecticut, for nearly 6,000 years\r\nbefore its waters existed near Northampton.\r\n\r\nThese beds of clay hold the moisture close to the surface throughout the\r\nlowland, making it available to the fields of vegetables and tobacco.\r\nTowards the valley margins these crops disappear because the fine\r\nsediments end against the rocky shores of the adjacent hills which pass\r\ninto and beneath sloping terraces of sand and gravel. In the numerous\r\nterraces which fringe the hills, the horizontal beds of gravel lie above\r\nlakeward-dipping beds of coarse sand; they underlie broad flats furrowed\r\nby channel-like depressions which radiate from the valleys at the apex\r\nof each flat. On these terraces one can easily picture sand-laden waters\r\ncoursing through the channels and building deltas outward into the lake.\r\n\r\nDeltas were built wherever streams from the highlands entered the\r\nvalley, and they mark the ancient level of the lake. Strangely, their\r\nelevation drops from 315 feet at Montague to 300 feet at Amherst, and is\r\nonly 268 feet at South Hadley. The changing elevation shows either that\r\nthe lake surface sloped southward--and indeed this would be unique--or\r\nthat the shoreline was raised in the north and that the lake drained\r\nsouthward. The latter surmise is plainly the more plausible.\r\n\r\nMost deltas on the east side of the valley are pitted by numerous\r\nconical depressions. In a depression on a delta plain near Montague, an\r\nexcavation, made to obtain road fill, disclosed a mass of disordered\r\ngravel which must originally have been deposited in the horizontal\r\ntop-set beds of the delta, but which now lies in the bottom of a\r\ndepression mingled with the fine sand of the underlying fore-set beds.\r\nThe top-set beds seem to have been supported for some time and then\r\ncollapsed as if the underpinnings were removed. The crudely circular or\r\nelliptical outlines of the depressions suggest that stray icebergs\r\ndrifted upon the delta slopes, where they were anchored or buried by the\r\nsandy outwash. The buried ice-cakes survived until the lake was drained,\r\nand the baselevel of the streams was lowered, for the depressions have\r\nno outwash within them. They collapsed soon after the lake vanished,\r\nbecause water soaking through the delta sands melted the ice, much as it\r\nthaws the ground for dredging in the Yukon. Even today this gravelly\r\nground, particularly the beach of the ancient lake, is well drained, and\r\nit forms the best land for the apple orchards of the valley.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Glaciers Came_\r\n\r\nThe delta deposits and the clays form a thin veneer over a bouldery soil\r\nthat comes to light along the delta-top margins and in gulches cut down\r\nthrough the gravel and sand. Some of the boulders are huge, attaining\r\ndiameters of twenty feet; and all are strangers to their present resting\r\nplaces. Some are set upon a bare rock floor, scratched as though by\r\nsandpaper, and they teeter to the weight of a child; most are embedded\r\nin soil. These \"erratics\" seem to have been left like unwanted objects,\r\npicked up and carried for a time, and then dropped when the bearer\r\nwearied of their weight. The scratches on the rock floor are parallel\r\ngrooves, all of which trend southward. They are unmistakable tracks left\r\nby glaciers, and the boulders are like the stones perched on glacial ice\r\nfor a ride to the terminal moraine.\r\n\r\nThe land above the old lake shore is bare scratched rock or rocky soil\r\ncalled boulder till. Every hill farm has been cleared of more stones\r\nthan trees, and it is only with the vogue of the rock garden that these\r\nerratics have found any merit in man's estimation. It has been said with\r\na considerable element of truth that the lake margin can be identified\r\nby the stone fences heaped up by exasperated farmers at the line where\r\nthe water once lapped the slopes of the glaciated hills. Striations and\r\nerratics decorate the tops of Mount Tom and Mount Holyoke, and those who\r\nvisit Mount Monadnock or Mount Washington will find they must inscribe\r\ntheir initials over the signature of the great ice sheet.\r\n\r\nThe stranger rocks or erratics, stranded promiscuously over the\r\ncountryside, can be traced to hills farther north. Clearly the ice sheet\r\nwas moving southward, picking up debris and abrading the countryside\r\nlike a great sanding machine. Northern slopes were worn to long gentle\r\ninclines and the southern slopes kept their original forms or were\r\nsteepened as the ice plucked fractured blocks from their moorings. One\r\nimaginative writer likened the glaciated rock hills to the wigs of\r\nsheep's wool worn by the jurists of his day; the name stuck, and they\r\nare still known as _roches moutonnées_. Look at the Pelham Hills from\r\nthe Coolidge Memorial Bridge and you will see the top of Jeffrey Lord\r\nAmherst's wig facing towards Canada.\r\n\r\nWithin the Connecticut Lowland the moving ice often picked up a load of\r\ndebris more cumbersome than it could drag along. It handled the\r\nsituation most satisfactorily by dropping the load and streamlining it,\r\nand these piles of glacial debris with blunt north slopes and gentle\r\nsoutherly sides are drumlins. When next you pass the apple orchards of\r\nSouth Amherst, recall that the smooth elliptical hill east of the road\r\nto South Hadley is a drumlin, a relic of an overloaded glacier.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Just Before the Ice Age_\r\n\r\nThe glacier advanced as far as Long Island and Martha's Vineyard, and\r\nthe lakes of the Connecticut Valley formed along the ice margin and\r\nspread northward as the ice front receded. The distinct layers, or\r\nvarves, of clay mark off 25,000 years since the recession began, but for\r\na million years before its final retreat, the ice covered all New\r\nEngland intermittently. This length of time transcends human\r\ncomprehension unless one considers years in terms of what has been done.\r\nA million years is not too long for a sand-laden ice sheet, moving only\r\na few feet each year, to grind tens of feet of solid rock off the north\r\nsides of the \"everlasting\" hills. To those who study the earth, \"Before\r\nthe Ice Age\" has about the same significance as \"Before the Hurricane\"\r\nhas to the average citizen of New England. It is in such terms that\r\ngeologic time must be considered.\r\n\r\nThe ice sheet simply modified the pre-glacial topography; it changed\r\nsymmetrical hills to asymmetric _roches moutonnées_ and left boulder\r\ntill spread over much of the bedrock floor. The greatest changes were\r\neffected in the White Mountains, where the steep-walled river valleys\r\nwere changed to troughs with a U cross-section, as in the scenic\r\nnotches; or with steep headwalls like that in Tuckerman Ravine, a\r\ntypical alpine cirque. Within the lowlands boulder till was left as a\r\nblanket, concealing the irregularities which were made in the rock floor\r\nat an earlier geologic date. These irregularities may pass unnoticed\r\nunless some construction project happens to reveal them. Bedrock is\r\nrarely over seventy feet down at any point in the lowland, but work at\r\nthe Sunderland Bridge and the Coolidge Memorial Bridge encountered\r\nmasses of glacial debris in a deep fluvial channel more than three\r\nhundred feet below the river surface and at least two hundred feet below\r\nthe present level of the sea. This deep trough is not over one hundred\r\nyards wide, and if it were fully exposed to view, it would look like a\r\nminiature Saguenay gorge. Similar trenches in every part of eastern\r\nNorth America, from Hudson Bay to Cape Hatteras, show that the land once\r\nstood higher than it does now, and that the main rivers flowed in deep,\r\nnarrow canyons, although the upland surface between the rivers had its\r\npresent characteristics. Thus, in Pliocene time, while primitive members\r\nof the human race were entering old England, New England rose high above\r\nsea level, and its lowlands were trenched by quickened streams.\r\n\r\nThe narrow gorges are an eloquent, if mute, record of rivers suddenly\r\nrejuvenated, their current accelerated and the exuberant waters cutting\r\ninto freshly elevated rock. Massachusetts and the neighboring states\r\nalong the Atlantic seaboard formed a plateau-like upland, perhaps one\r\nthousand feet higher than today, and the coastline lay fifty to one\r\nhundred miles out under the present waters of the Atlantic.\r\n\r\nThe Pliocene episode of stream incision was of short duration. The\r\ngorges are not wide, and only near the sea do they cut deep into the\r\ncoherent crystalline rock which gives New England its solid foundation.\r\nNowhere did the land remain elevated long enough to permit the rivers to\r\nwiden their canyons through the plateau-like country and to modify the\r\nessential features of the landscape. The latter were acquired in an\r\nearlier geologic epoch called the Miocene, and the scenic pattern carved\r\nby running water in that relatively remote division of time still\r\ndominates the region's topographic form.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Rivers Carried Off the Everlasting Hills_\r\n\r\nEvery stream has its load of sediment, as the silt- and sand-filled\r\nreservoirs along the edges of the valley so effectively testify. Each\r\nsandy river bed is an aggregate of rolling grains, moving with the\r\ncurrent, slow where it is slow and faster where the current is\r\naccelerated, but travelling always towards the sea. Every grain is a\r\npiece of the countryside lost to the land and soon to become a part of\r\nthe ocean floor. Very little of this sand comes from the lowland itself,\r\nfor the Connecticut may cut the bank below Hadley, but it leaves almost\r\nas much sand as it acquires on the opposite shore. The river's burden is\r\nbrought to it by swift tributaries--the brook at West Pelham and\r\nhundreds more like it. Their sides are cut-banks, but no extensive sand\r\nbars are built to balance their erosive work; what they pick up they\r\ncarry to the lowland, and what they bring to the lowland is soon\r\ntransported to the sea.\r\n\r\nThe contribution which the tributaries make to the lowland rivers was\r\ndemonstrated only too conspicuously by the great fans of coarse debris\r\nspread across the valley of the Deerfield River and the West River\r\nduring the floods that accompanied the torrential rains of the\r\nhurricane. Parts of the village of Townshend, Vermont, nestling in the\r\nflat floor of the West River valley, were buried in gravel wash, and the\r\nhillside roads above were gullied ten feet deep. One harassed traveler\r\naptly remarked that the original road level could be recognized from the\r\nfew concordant remnants of pavement beside the trout brook.\r\n\r\nThe hill slopes at Townshend rise and end near Jamaica, about one\r\nthousand feet higher in elevation. Here the roads are in good condition.\r\nThere are no signs of erosion, and the rolling uplands extend for miles\r\nwith no signs of gullying or wash by the heavy rains.\r\n\r\nThe debris handled by the West River now and for ages past has come from\r\nthe steep hill slopes along the main valley. Each load of sand has cut\r\nthese slopes back from the main stream and has widened the lowland\r\nfloor. So, for millions of years, the tributaries of the Connecticut\r\nhave pushed the valley walls farther from the main river, and their\r\ntributaries in turn have pushed their hill slopes back, while the valley\r\nfloors have steadily widened. The Connecticut Lowland was broadened in\r\nthis way, and the tributary Deerfield has developed its valley in\r\nsimilar fashion but to a lesser degree. Today streams near the\r\nheadwaters acquire sediment, not from the upland across which they flow\r\nto reach the deeply entrenched valleys, but from the steep slopes in the\r\nmost remote recesses of the upland on which they rise.\r\n\r\nFlat valley floors are broadened in coherent rocks as well as in\r\nunconsolidated sand--less rapidly, indeed, but just as surely; and every\r\nregion is worn down to the grade of the streams which drain it, except\r\nfor those rare masses of resistant rock which defy decay and yield\r\nreluctantly to their inevitable fate. The rocks of the Mount Holyoke and\r\nMount Tom ranges, Mount Warner, the Pocumtuck Hills and the highlands on\r\nboth sides of the Connecticut Valley are made of tougher ingredients\r\nthan the lowland, and even millions of years of incessant onslaught by\r\nrunning water did not suffice to level them by Miocene time, when the\r\nlowland was excavated.\r\n\r\n    Pl. 3. _Erosion remnants or monadnocks surmounting base levelled\r\n    surfaces._\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: a. _Mt. Sugarloaf, a remnant of Triassic rocks\r\n    disappearing grain by grain down the Connecticut River._]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: b. _Mt.

It continues southward\r\nwith diminishing elevation to New Haven, where it joins another broad\r\ndepression, now flooded by the waters of Long Island Sound.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Before the Rivers Cut the Valleys_\r\n\r\nThose who would see the land as it was before the rivers carved the\r\nlowlands must put back every grain of sand the waters carried away; they\r\nmust fill in these valleys to the level of the Jamaica upland. Then only\r\nwill the country be as it was before the streams were rejuvenated and\r\nstarted to cut deep trenches and to widen them as the Deerfield has done\r\nat Charlemont.\r\n\r\nBroad, open valley flats or straths surmount the steep V-shaped notches\r\nof both the Deerfield and Westfield Rivers. Surely, everyone who has\r\npaused at the lookout on the east summit of the Mohawk Trail has seen\r\nthe upland sloping gently towards the Deerfield and then breaking\r\nsharply at the top of the present canyon. The same view confronts the\r\nmotorist who drives from Adams to Cummington, just after he leaves the\r\nvillage of Plainfield. Here the shallow bowl in front of him holds no\r\nhint of the deep notch in which the Westfield flows. The gentle contour\r\nof the land suggests only the slow but methodical sort of change which\r\ncomes with maturity. Those who favor air travel will see, as they fly\r\nover Mount Tom, a similar but more dissected strath reaching into the\r\nhills northwestward from Northampton. Aeroplanes flying the Boston-New\r\nYork route pass over straths which have been trenched by the Connecticut\r\nalong its course from Middletown to New London.\r\n\r\nThe straths are part of a mature, but ancient drainage system, which was\r\ngraded a thousand feet above the level of the present streams and only a\r\nfew hundred feet below the main upland. Certain broad depressions\r\nthrough the highlands east of the Connecticut Lowland suggest that this\r\ndrainage pursued a southeastward course to the Atlantic, and that the\r\nriver did not establish its modern course until the straths were\r\nelevated and notched.\r\n\r\nThe land level above the strath-margins is a still older surface from\r\nwhich the rock-benches were cut. The higher surface stretches to the\r\nhorizon at Pelham, but Mount Monadnock and Wachusett stand conspicuously\r\nabove it. And on the Mohawk Trail one must ascend the tower at the\r\neastern summit before any higher land comes into view. Greylock's summit\r\nand the long chain of the Green Mountains attain greater elevations. The\r\nWest River and Deerfield basins are graded to the level of this higher\r\nand older erosion surface, but farther north a chain of peaks including\r\nStratton and Okemo swing eastward towards Ascutney. They appear to have\r\nformed a divide on this ancient land, as they do today; and beyond their\r\ncrests rivers have run to the Saint Lawrence and Hudson basins from a\r\ntime which antedated any of the familiar features of the New England\r\nlandscape.\r\n\r\nAlthough this flat upland surface is more complex than it appears to the\r\neye, it dominates all of southern New England, and ramifying arms of it\r\npenetrate northward into the White Mountains of New Hampshire and Maine.\r\nAnother great arm passes west of Mount Greylock and spreads out between\r\nthe Catskill Mountains and the Adirondacks. During the long period of\r\nerosion when it was formed, New England was reduced nearer to the grade\r\nof the main rivers than at any other time either before or since, and\r\nonly rocks which have effectively resisted all later assaults by the\r\ngeologic processes of destruction surmount the surface. To the eye, the\r\nregion appears so nearly planed that it has been called the New England\r\npeneplane.\r\n\r\nThe upland continues southward through the Berkshire and Litchfield\r\nHills, descending in a series of almost imperceptible steps towards Long\r\nIsland Sound and the Atlantic. A few miles south of Litchfield,\r\nConnecticut, its low angle of declivity increases abruptly, and the more\r\nsteeply inclined surface passes beneath the waters of Long Island Sound.\r\nThe sudden change in dip suggests that two erosional planes are present\r\nand that each was formed under somewhat different circumstances and in\r\ndifferent periods of geologic time. The soundness of this surmise can be\r\ndemonstrated in Long Island where sediments laid in a Cretaceous sea\r\nrest upon the older and more sharply inclined erosional plane and rise\r\napproximately to the level of the New England upland. The deposits form\r\na wedge between the two planes, and their Cretaceous age supplies a\r\nseries of dates that would otherwise be difficult to establish in New\r\nEngland's geological history. Erosion fashioned the New England upland\r\nin the early and middle epochs of the Tertiary period, immediately\r\nfollowing the deposition of sediments in the Cretaceous sea. And the\r\nsouthward sloping plane upon which those sediments rest records an even\r\nearlier episode of denudation--an episode lost in the shuffle of later\r\nevents in Massachusetts but preserved in fragmentary form in\r\nConnecticut, thanks to the protection afforded by the sedimentary cover.\r\n\r\nHad we lived in central New England when erosion of the upland and of\r\nthe younger straths was in progress, we would have noted that the valley\r\nforms were well defined in the headwaters and lower reaches of the\r\nstreams, which made their way through a country of light-colored or gray\r\nclayey soil. In the middle reaches the valley boundaries were blurred\r\nand indistinct, and the country through which they flowed was surfaced\r\nby red and sandy soil. The middle region is now the lowland, but even\r\nthen it formed a depression athwart the topographic and hydrographic\r\nfeatures of the country; and its distinctive red soil resembled alluvial\r\nwash or fill in a long basin. Its low relief would have been as\r\nimpressive in early Tertiary time as its higher relief is today, for\r\nthen it had little topographic competition anywhere between the present\r\nsites of New Haven, Connecticut, and Northfield, Massachusetts.\r\n\r\nThe land had one dominant characteristic--a relatively flat or faintly\r\nterraced surface. But this surface concealed a mosaic made of an\r\ninfinite variety of rocks, each responding to the attack of weather in\r\nits own particular way. Erosion has brought out the pattern of the\r\nmosaic, and we have retraced the steps in its development. Viewing the\r\nevolution of the countryside in retrospect, we see its features take\r\nform much as a worker on an inlaid bronze might watch the design come\r\nout when it is etched. The creation of the mosaic or inlay is another\r\npart of the history, and the relief of the land now permits closer\r\nscrutiny of the pattern than would have been possible in Cretaceous\r\ntime.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                  The Mosaic of Central Massachusetts\r\n\r\n\r\nThe great artisan incorporated three main features in the mosaic beneath\r\nthe New England upland, and from them erosion developed the major\r\npattern of the present landscape. The three units of the pattern\r\ncomprise a somewhat heterogeneous but durable foreground in the east, a\r\nweak inlaid design in the center, and a moderately homogeneous and\r\ndurable background in the west. The foreground and background are simply\r\na suitable base for the younger, central feature of the design--an inlay\r\nwhich was completed in Triassic time, while the mighty dinosaurs were\r\nbeginning to gain confidence as the new rulers of the earth. Skillful\r\nartistry and complicated technique were expended on the Triassic inlay,\r\nfor in part it was rolled in, partly melted in, and some of it was cut\r\nin amid the tougher materials now found on either side.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Red Rock Basin_\r\n\r\nThe youngest ingredients which were incorporated in the inlay are a\r\nseries of fine-grained red sandstones and consolidated clays or shales.\r\nThey are horizontal layers, turned up slightly at the edges of the\r\nlowland, but elsewhere they lie in almost horizontal beds that extend\r\nfrom South Hadley through Chicopee (Chicopee shale), Springfield, and\r\nLongmeadow (Longmeadow sandstone) to a point just south of Hartford.\r\nNear the hills which form the eastern boundary of the lowland these\r\nfine-grained sediments locally give way to coarse tabular deposits of\r\nangular gravel, which appear along the base of the Wilbraham Mountains\r\nand again in Mount Toby and northward. The deposits are isolated or\r\ndetached masses which resemble fans emerging from mountains, not unlike\r\nthe more modern sands and gravels which the Westfield River left where\r\nit emerged from the western hills. But the Triassic gravels are red, and\r\nthey are firmly cemented into conglomerate; yet it is plain that this\r\npart of the inlay was made by washing and rolling the red muds, sands,\r\nand cobbles into a depressed basin waiting to receive them.\r\n\r\nThe southern part of the basin was deepened, and the highlands were\r\nrejuvenated spasmodically from Springfield to New Haven. The sinking of\r\nthe lowland on the west and the rising of the highlands on the east took\r\nplace along a fracture plane, commonly called \"the eastern border\r\nfault,\" near the eastern limits of the red sediments throughout that\r\npart of the valley. The rocks composing the alluvial fans are flexed\r\nsharply downward east of Portland, Connecticut, like compressed pages in\r\na book, where the great eastern mountain block pushed obliquely against\r\nthem. In this way the mountain range was renewed as erosion wore it\r\naway, and the basin was deepened periodically as the wash from the\r\nhighlands filled it. The intermittent uplift sustained the growth of the\r\nfans along the edge of the lowland, but the frequent recurrence of\r\nmovement never permitted these graded accumulations of waste to extend\r\nfar out from their mountain sources.\r\n\r\nThe great fracture, which sharply delimits rocks of different origins,\r\nand the deformation in the strata near Portland record, as surely as the\r\nwritings of any human historian, a tale of periodic rock compression and\r\nparoxysmal release that must have been accompanied by violent tremors.\r\nConnecticut and Massachusetts had their earthquakes and had them as\r\nviolent as any now originating in the western ranges of the United\r\nStates and Mexico; but happily they shook a land which was overrun by\r\nthe dinosaurs, and which was not yet ready for human habitation.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 7. _Map of Mount Toby showing gorges filled with\r\n    conglomerate._]\r\n\r\nNear the northern terminus of the Triassic basin the eastern boundary\r\nwas not subject to intermittent and violent movements during the later\r\nstages of sedimentation, as it was in the south. Instead, the youngest\r\npart of the red-rock inlay consists, in some places, of unfractured\r\nboulder beds which were washed far out towards the center of the\r\nlowland; elsewhere, landslides brought masses of rock debris upon soft\r\nred and gray shales, which may have accumulated in shallow lakes; in\r\nstill other localities, long stringers of red sediment reach far back\r\ninto the eastern highlands. Many boulders in the conglomerate at the\r\nsouth end of Mount Toby are eight feet in diameter, and torrential\r\nmountain streams brought them to their resting place. A few are\r\nscratched and grooved, much like the boulders in the till left by the\r\nice sheet; perhaps they signify the presence of snow fields and glaciers\r\nin the mountain range, but the scratches may have been acquired by\r\navalanching. The landslide masses buried in the shales at the Sunderland\r\ncaves show that the mountain front was steep, and the ancient talus or\r\nslide rock near the Central Vermont Railroad south of Roaring Brook\r\nshows plainly that the mountain front was a precipitous cliff of\r\ngranite. The stringers of conglomerate extending eastward into the\r\ngranite upland south of Montague, north of Leverett station, at Amherst,\r\nand again near Granby, are alluvial fill in ancient mountain gorges.\r\n\r\nThis old mountain mass stood out as a long, straight range extending\r\nfrom a point east of New Haven northward into New Hampshire. It was of\r\nmoderate height in Connecticut, but it became higher and more rugged to\r\nthe north; glaciers may have nestled around its crest east of Deerfield,\r\nand its front was an impressive slope of slide rock. Granite gorges with\r\ntapering gravel plains, dry one day and raging torrents the next,\r\nfingered eastward into the mountain block. At that time the Connecticut\r\nValley was much like the land east of the Sierra Nevada in California,\r\nwhere greater contrasts in heights and depths are to be found than in\r\nany other part of the United States.\r\n\r\n\r\n_A Dinosaur Diary_\r\n\r\nLike the valley east of the Sierras, the depression in central\r\nMassachusetts contained playa lakes and intermittent streams. Sand\r\nbrought by the mountain torrents clogged the channels and spread into\r\nbroad alluvial plains, while silt accumulated in muddy lake basins.\r\nBlack sandy shales now mark the sites of the lake beds, and their black\r\ncolor comes from the coaly remnants of Triassic plants. Some swampy lake\r\nmargins supported peat bogs, which have been preserved in coal seams two\r\nto three inches thick between Granby and South Hadley. Many of the lakes\r\nlasted long enough to become stocked with half a dozen species of fish.\r\nBut the fish led a precarious existence, and their skeletons were buried\r\nin great numbers in the upper lacustrine layers when the lakes dried up,\r\nand dust and sand drifted over the parched basins at Durham,\r\nConnecticut, and at Sunderland, Massachusetts. The remains were interred\r\neven more effectively when cloudbursts in the hills brought thick layers\r\nof gravel out over the ancient lake beds.\r\n\r\nMost of the lakes and ponds were ephemeral, but the fact that their\r\npresence was more than a mirage in a Triassic desert is clear from the\r\nripple-marks retained on their sun-hardened surfaces, and from the\r\nimpressions of objects which touched them while they were still soft.\r\nStray series of parallel furrows record the passing of drifting shrubs,\r\nand the abrupt disappearance of rain-drop imprints at a well defined\r\nline in the hardened mud marks the exact position of the water level in\r\na few of these Triassic water bodies. Footprints register the activities\r\ncarried on by a bizarre animal population. Beside the road to the French\r\nKing Bridge and in the river bed at Turners Falls the ripple-marked\r\nsurfaces contain the impressions of many feet, and the dinosaur tracks\r\nat \"the Riffles\" beside the Northampton-Holyoke highway are known\r\nthroughout the country. In Connecticut, Middletown and Durham are famed\r\nfor their tracks, and the impressions left in the playa beds by muddy\r\nfeet are so widely distributed throughout the lowland that it must have\r\ntaken a lot of walking by many generations of dinosaurs to leave such an\r\nample record.\r\n\r\n    Pl. 4. _Rocks of the Triassic basin and their record._\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: a. _A dinosaur walked from the raindrop marked\r\n    surface at the right to a shallow pond at the left._]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: b. _Volcanoes ejected much ash and many bombs to form\r\n    the Granby tuff._]\r\n\r\nSome of these three-toed animals were like the modern lizards and walked\r\non all four feet; but the great majority walked on two feet and, like\r\nthe kangaroos, used their tails to balance their bodies, and their short\r\nfore limbs to support them when they crouched. In any single playa\r\ndeposit, variations in the sizes and kinds of footprints reveal that\r\nmany individuals made them; yet strangely, most of the tracks at any one\r\nplace are headed in a single direction. Apparently the herd instinct\r\nmust have been strong in these reptiles, as it is in kangaroos or in a\r\nflock of turkeys, all following a leader, with only an occasional\r\nindividual going off to one side or back-tracking in a display of\r\nindependence. And so the dinosaurs dominated the life in the early\r\nConnecticut basin, as it sank and trembled, and as mountains rose to the\r\neast; on dry days and days of cloudburst, on hot days and days when\r\nfrost crystals formed in the mud, they roamed the plain, as the lowland\r\nsettled nearly two miles and filled to the brim with red sands, muds,\r\nand marginal gravels.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Volcanoes_\r\n\r\nRed is the predominant color in the central inlay of the New England\r\ndesign, but greens and blue-black lines have been worked into the\r\npattern. The dinosaur-ridden basin has a rim south of Middletown in\r\nConnecticut, and another north of Holyoke in Massachusetts; it lies just\r\nwest of the dinosaur-track ledge near Holyoke, and the tracks themselves\r\nare only thirty feet above the bottom of the basin. The rim is an odd\r\nensemble--now red and now green; here solid and hard and black, there\r\nsoft and fragmental and crumbly. The fragments may be angular or round;\r\nsandy or glassy; dense and solid, or full of bubble holes like molasses\r\ntaffy. The whole looks like the spread-out ash dump from a giant power\r\nplant. And not only does it resemble an ash heap--it _is_ the ash heap\r\nof a volcano; and the hard black layers within it are lava flows\r\ninterspersed with the heavy falls of ash.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 8. _Map showing agglomerate burying a fault\r\n    scarp on the power line through the east gap of the Notch._]\r\n\r\nThe ancient ash heap grows thicker east of the Connecticut River, and it\r\nis more than 3,000 feet from top to bottom around a series of massive\r\nblue-black rock-columns southeast of the Mount Holyoke Hotel. These are\r\nthe lava-filled necks of craters which became quiescent with the dawn of\r\nthe dinosaur days. The ash deposit, called the Granby tuff, grows\r\nthinner eastward away from the craters and disappears completely\r\nnortheast of Granby, where a stream deploying from a valley in the\r\neastern mountains washed it away as fast as it fell and left coarse\r\ngravel in the form of a huge fan.\r\n\r\nThe floor on which the ash came to rest was not everywhere the same.\r\nWhere now it crosses the Northampton-Holyoke highway and the\r\nAmherst-South Hadley road it was a lava flow; but north of Granby and at\r\nnumerous places between the Hockanum and Amherst-South Hadley roads the\r\nash lies on conglomerate. Along the Amherst-Springfield power line, a\r\nblock of the conglomerate floor was pushed up five hundred feet above\r\nthe same beds farther west, forming a small block mountain which was\r\nentirely buried beneath the ash. Similar block mountains can be observed\r\nunder the blanket of ash, especially on the south side of the Holyoke\r\nRange; and renewed movement subsequently affected many of the blocks\r\nnorth of Granby, where the ash deposit and even some of the sediments\r\nlaid down in the earlier days of the dinosaurs were fractured and\r\ndisplaced. As a rule, along any one fault, the block on the east was\r\npushed up and moved southward; and the block on the west was pressed\r\ndown: as a group, the fractures may form the beginning of the great\r\neastern border fault which bounds the basin farther south.\r\n\r\nThe volcanoes which made the Granby tuff or ash bed erupted\r\nintermittently for a long period of time. Usually, the river which\r\nemerged from the eastern mountain range brought so much fluvial debris\r\nthat ash is not in evidence except in the immediate vicinity of the\r\ncraters located between the Notch and the summit of Mount Holyoke. Even\r\nthough alluvial sands and gravels supplant the tuff here and there, the\r\nriver did not succeed in closing or quenching those fiery vents. The\r\nrocks now present recount a struggle in which, at times, the river\r\nencroached upon the cinder cones; at others, the ashes choked the stream\r\nand buried its alluvial wash.\r\n\r\nWhile the volcanoes rumbled and erupted, earth forces intermittently\r\nthrust the eastern mountain range southward and upward, dragging the\r\neastern margin of the lowland with it and upturning the sedimentary\r\nfill, much as a plow might upend a layer of snow at the roadside before\r\nshearing it off and pushing it out of the way. The relentless movement\r\ncaused the entire eastern floor of the basin to be broken into blocks;\r\nthe easterly ones were piled against the westerly, and their eastern\r\nedges were pushed down into the basin floor and the western borders rode\r\nup on their neighbors. Through all this tremendous disturbance the great\r\nstream pouring out of the mountain pass kept the elevated blocks cut\r\ndown and the small basins filled in. Earthquakes, erupting volcanoes,\r\nand shifting rivers made life for the dinosaurs troubled and a bit\r\nuncertain.\r\n\r\nOnly once did the volcanoes dominate the situation in the valley, and\r\nthat was very early in their history. A group of vents, localized along\r\na southward trending zone about a mile west of the Notch, and another\r\ngroup along the present course of the Connecticut River from Turners\r\nFalls to Sunderland poured out billions of cubic feet of black basaltic\r\nlava into the center of the lowland. Eruptions followed in such rapid\r\nsuccession that the rivers never scoured the surface of the earlier\r\nflows. Lava piled up 400 feet thick in the center of the basin east of\r\nthe Mount Tom Range; it moved eastward in a flow which thinned against\r\nthe fans of rivers issuing from the eastern mountain, and it ended in a\r\nformidable wall of scoria confronting the mountain streams. Lava buried\r\nthe northern basin from Sunderland to Turners Falls and beyond, while\r\nthe southern basin filled from Northampton to New Haven. But lava\r\ndominance was short-lived, and even before its bubbly surface reddened\r\nto the weather, streams had covered it with gravel.\r\n\r\nThe lava flows are the most resistant materials used in the lowland\r\ndesign. They form the ridge east of Greenfield in the northern basin.\r\nThe Holyoke and Mount Tom Ranges are remnants of these flows, tilted at\r\nmoderate but varying angles by the recurrent movements which enlivened\r\nthe epoch of dinosaurs and volcanoes.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 9. _Block diagram showing the main features of\r\n    central Massachusetts during volcanic stage._]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 10. _Block diagram showing the Triassic basins\r\n    of central Massachusetts._]\r\n\r\nThe most spectacular episode of lava extrusion was localized in a small\r\nvolcanic center situated about one mile west of the Notch in the Holyoke\r\nRange. All flows in the range moved away from this center, and before\r\nthe great outpouring took place, minor explosive outbursts had built\r\ncones of ash with bases up to a mile in diameter. Small lava tongues are\r\ninterspersed with the ash beds, and mixtures of sand and lava tell of\r\nbreaks through the 1,500 feet of sandy fill which was rapidly\r\naccumulating in the basin. Throughout this early period of volcanic\r\nactivity the streams brought out so much wash from the eastern mountains\r\nthat they soon dominated the scene in Massachusetts, and in Connecticut\r\nvolcanoes gained ascendancy for one brief moment of geologic time, when\r\nan early flow covered much of the valley from Hartford south.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Original Valley_\r\n\r\nThe first and oldest ingredients in the central design are entirely red.\r\nThe materials are fragments of older rocks--granite and gneiss, schist\r\nand pegmatite, feldspar and quartz. They are invariably coarse, for\r\nevery layer of inwashed sediment has pieces over an eighth of an inch in\r\ndiameter, and only the coarser particles were smoothed. The finer\r\nparticles were not moved about enough to have their sharp corners worn\r\naway. The pebbles and clay in the thick layers of conglomerate at the\r\nFrench King Bridge were dropped by rushing, overloaded torrents\r\ndeploying on a lowland--a situation not unlike the one at Townshend,\r\nVermont, during the hurricane deluge. Only fine debris was transported\r\nacross the fans to the far side of the basin. The western hills made\r\nsmall contributions of sediment; but their streams brought particles\r\nwhich never exceeded an inch in diameter, and in quantities so moderate\r\nthat the fragments underwent some sorting and sizing as they were spread\r\nover the lowland. From the very start the valley was deeper near the\r\neast wall than the west; and the eastern mountain block was greatly\r\nelevated, whereas the western block was simply a hilly upland.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 11. _Map of the old volcanic region near Mount\r\n    Hitchcock and west of the Notch._]\r\n\r\nThe edge of the eastern mountain mass is located at the French King\r\nBridge and passes half a mile west of Montague. Its location beneath the\r\nyounger fill is known less perfectly farther south, but it seems to\r\nextend through Amherst, certainly west of South Amherst and Granby and\r\nprobably east of the Notch. At least two mountains rose above the\r\nancient lowland floor; the northern one is a long ridge of schist\r\nbetween Bernardston and Mount Hermon, and the other is Mount Warner.\r\nMount Warner is an island of highland rocks in a sea of red sandstone\r\nfill. The Bernardston ridge resembles a peninsula in somewhat analogous\r\nsedimentary surroundings. The two eminences reveal the form of the\r\nvalley floor and the western hills at the dawn of the Triassic period,\r\nfor they were spared from destruction by burial, until deep erosion\r\nexposed them again in Miocene time.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Hot Springs in Central Massachusetts_\r\n\r\nHot springs the world over register their presence by leaving deposits\r\nof unusual minerals, and they have left this sort of record at\r\nLoudville. Here the coarse sandstones of the lowland rest upon gneiss,\r\nand at the south end of the Loudville lead vein barium sulphate\r\ncrystals, called barite, formed in the sand before it was cemented into\r\nsolid rock. The crystals are the product of highly charged mineral\r\nwater, rising through the sands from a subjacent fissure. The fissure\r\nitself is also filled with barite, and with galena and quartz as well.\r\nIt is the vein which was worked in the old Loudville lead mine. There\r\nare other veins in the western and eastern highlands at Hatfield, at the\r\nNorthampton reservoir near Whately, and at Leverett. All are in\r\nfractures which were still partly open when the valley first took form.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Marginal Uplands_\r\n\r\nThe rocks which formed the high eastern mountain range of Triassic time\r\nand the rocks which made the old western hills and underlay the basin\r\nfloor comprise essentially a single group characterized by its\r\ncomplexity. At one place the rock resembles sandstone, but the layers\r\nstand on end; at another, it looks like shale, but the stone breaks\r\nacross the color banding instead of parallel to it; and at a third place\r\na fissure seems to have opened and had a crystallizing melt poured into\r\nit. These tabular, filled fissures can be found nearly everywhere,\r\ncoursing in every direction and at all conceivable inclinations to form\r\na network that binds the older rocks into a firmly knit whole. The\r\nfillings, or dikes, are like reinforcing rods, holding the rocks\r\ntogether and withstanding the agents of destruction. Thus, the story of\r\nthe highlands has three distinctive phases,--a relatively young phase\r\nwhen the interlacing reinforcements were poured into fractures; a\r\nsomewhat more remote stage, when the bedded rocks were crumpled into\r\ntheir inclined positions; and an earlier stage, when the bedded rocks\r\nwere deposited. The geologic dates of these three events may vary from\r\none locality to another, and they certainly are different in the Eastern\r\nUpland as compared with the Western Upland; but the events always\r\noccurred in this sequence and constitute the broader aspects of the\r\nstory at all places.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 12. _Block diagram showing topography during\r\n    formation of the lead veins._]\r\n\r\n\r\n                          _The Eastern Upland_\r\n\r\nThe Eastern Upland includes the land between the Connecticut Valley and\r\nthe Atlantic Ocean. At present, it has the general form of a broad\r\nrolling highland with ridges and valleys that have a north-south trend.\r\nClose inspection shows that the rocks in the ridges are different from\r\nthose in the long valleys. Also the layering of the materials ranges\r\nfrom a vertical attitude, as at Ware and Brimfield, to undulating and\r\nalmost horizontal positions, as at Spencer and Worcester.\r\n\r\nThrough vertical and horizontal beds alike run those reinforcing\r\nsheets--some tabular and vertical, called dikes; others also tabular but\r\nhorizontal, called sills; and some are just huge, irregular masses\r\nwithout visible bottoms, called stocks and batholiths. Some of them,\r\ncomposed of uniform, small, light-colored minerals, are granite; others\r\nare made entirely of large minerals over an inch across and are called\r\npegmatite; a few, with cuneiform intergrowths of a dark mineral in a\r\nlight one, arranged like Arabic writing, are known as graphic granite.\r\n\r\n    Pl. 5. _Intrusive and extrusive igneous rocks._\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: a. _Columnar lava rests upon red sandstone in the\r\n    cliffs at Greenfield._]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: b. _Fissures were filled with liquid rock that became\r\n    solid and bonded wall to wall at the Windsor Dam._]\r\n\r\nEvery one of these masses flowed into the rocks along fractures and\r\nother zones of weakness, crystallizing as they lost their heat and\r\nsolvents to the hot springs of that ancient time. They are all invaders,\r\nor intrusives, which inserted themselves into the older beds. Whether\r\nthey were squeezed into the fissures by the pressures that crumpled the\r\noriginal beds into their upturned positions, or whether they, like the\r\nliquid in a hydraulic press, transferred pressure from a deep reservoir\r\nto the walls of the fissures and so pushed the beds into their distorted\r\nforms, is unknown. Two features are clear; the distortion of the beds\r\nand intrusion of the liquid bodies were almost simultaneous, and the hot\r\nsprings associated with them were still active at the dawn of Triassic\r\ntime. These profound disturbances transformed the land into a series of\r\nelevated, wave-like folds, and rains promptly began to tear away at the\r\nsummits of the newly raised mountains. From them was carved a serrate\r\nand rugged landscape, part of which was later buried beneath the\r\nTriassic fill.\r\n\r\n\r\n            _Coal Swamps in Massachusetts and Rhode Island_\r\n\r\nAmong the strata of the Eastern Upland which were folded, intruded,\r\nbaked hard, and stewed in hot spring water, one group stands\r\npre-eminent. It forms a broad band starting north of Worcester and\r\nreaching to Providence and beyond. Nearly everywhere it carries coaly\r\nmaterial or impressions of plants which are now extinct, but which\r\nflourished in the Coal Age or Carboniferous period. Some of the coal\r\nseams were mined in the Providence basin, but they had been so heated by\r\nintrusive granite that they are partly graphitic and proved difficult to\r\nburn. The great extent of some of the coal seams suggests a panorama of\r\nimmense swamps, and of land so flat that, for long periods, streams\r\nbrought no sediment, and the trees and water-loving plants furnished the\r\nonly fill. At other times sluggish rivers, flowing from the northwest,\r\nlaid thick layers of sandy mud over the surface of the bogs. The\r\nalternating muds and coal seams are thousands of feet thick, and they\r\nrecord the story of a basin which sank as fast as it filled--a\r\ndepression which was never built high enough to be a well drained plain,\r\nyet never subsided sufficiently to be inundated by the sea. The\r\nCarboniferous peat bogs and mud flats may have extended westward almost\r\nto the Connecticut Valley; and farther to the northwest they were\r\nbounded by a chain of rolling hills.\r\n\r\nThe rock floor of the coal basin contains a variety of ancient\r\nmaterials. Some rocks were river deposits, some were marine limestones,\r\na few were lava and volcanic ash, and many were granite and gneiss which\r\ncrystallized at great depths and became exposed only after streams had\r\nstripped away the thick overburden. The basin floor thus holds a complex\r\nstory, in which land and sea, vulcanism and quiet, erosion and\r\ndeposition, all played their respective roles. Only in the west, along\r\nthe margin of the Connecticut Valley, is the involved story at all\r\nclear. And in the Western Upland across the red-rock inlay, it is\r\npossible to see some of the land as it was before trees took root in the\r\nswamps, and rivers brought sands and muds from the vegetated hills that\r\nhemmed in the coal basin.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          _The Western Upland_\r\n\r\nMany years ago, when transportation facilities were not what they are\r\nnow, New England settlers mined iron ore from the hill north of\r\nBernardston and smelted it in local charcoal furnaces. The rocks\r\ncontaining the iron are creased into sharp, close folds, and they came\r\ninto such close contact with a hot granite intrusive that their minerals\r\nwere changed by its action. This granite, however, is older than the one\r\nwhich is associated with the disturbed Carboniferous beds, for it was\r\nintruded when the Devonian sediments from Gaspé to Connecticut were\r\ndeformed. It was this profound disturbance that turned the red rocks of\r\nRoche Percé from a horizontal to a vertical position and raised a\r\nmountain range which stretched through all of northern New Brunswick,\r\nMaine, the lowland section of New Hampshire, and a belt extending for\r\nsome miles east and west of the Connecticut Valley. The eroded remnants\r\nof these Shickshock Mountains formed the backdrop for the great\r\nCarboniferous coal swamps in Rhode Island, Massachusetts, and Acadia.\r\n\r\nThe iron ore was a hot spring replacement of a limestone containing\r\nshells of sea organisms which lived when chordate animals first became\r\nabundant. This was the Devonian period in geologic history--the time\r\nwhen a backbone appeared essential in every really high-grade animal.\r\nThe limestone rests upon a beach gravel, now consolidated into a\r\nquartzite conglomerate. The gravel consisted of small white quartz\r\npebbles which came from the many veins in the steeply inclined slates of\r\nthe adjacent coast.\r\n\r\nMarine deposits of Devonian age are found as far south as Leverett, and\r\nscattered outcrops indicate that the old seaway reached northward up the\r\nConnecticut, entering Canada east of Lake Memphremagog. Thence it spread\r\neastward to Gaspé and westward to Montreal, and around the north and\r\nwest side of the Adirondack Mountains into New York State. A low rolling\r\nland where the Green Mountains stand today formed the western shore of\r\nthe Devonian sea for many miles northward into Quebec. The Adirondack\r\nand Taconic Mountains were a fused aggregate of undulating uplands which\r\nlimited the seaway on the south along the International Boundary. Its\r\neastern shore lay far beyond the horizon of the region described in this\r\nbrief account.\r\n\r\nThe rocks of the old Devonian coast in Massachusetts were chiefly\r\nslates, cut by many quartz veins. They are exposed along the Mohawk\r\nTrail in the ascent from Greenfield to Shelburne Summit, and they\r\ncontinue northward in an almost unbroken band through Bernardston,\r\nBrattleboro, and Northfield (Vermont) to Lake Memphremagog. They contain\r\ncasts of planktonic life which inhabited the Ordovician seas in these\r\nnorthern latitudes, and the Ordovician strata, together with still older\r\nCambrian sediments found below them, meet the Devonian beach deposits at\r\na sharp angle, just as the slates along the coast of Maine meet the\r\nmodern beach sands and gravels. Like the slates of Maine, they were\r\neroded deeply before the beach existed, and their slaty structure and\r\ntheir steeply inclined attitudes were acquired in a still more ancient\r\nepoch of deformation.\r\n\r\nThe folded rocks of Ordovician age flanked the highland area which now\r\nconstitutes the axis of the Green Mountains. West of the Green Mountains\r\nthey make the Taconic Range, and to the east they appear in ranges that\r\ngo under a variety of names, including the Northfield and the Lowell\r\nMountains. In the Taconics the folds have the shape of waves advancing\r\nwestward from the center of disturbance in the Green Mountain axis;\r\nwithin the Connecticut basin the Ordovician folds have wave-fronts which\r\nadvance from the same axis eastward across the Memphremagog sea. Along\r\nthe eastern margin of the old land a series of dark green intrusives\r\ncalled peridotite welled up from the depths of the earth, and they now\r\ncut through the rocks extending from Chester, Massachusetts, to Thetford\r\nMines, Quebec; they are like giant boundary posts marking the ancient\r\nline of demarcation between sea and land in Cambro-Ordovician time.\r\n\r\nOriginally the folded strata in the Taconic region were deposited in\r\nclear marine waters, where calcium carbonate accumulated rapidly. But\r\nthe sediments of the same age east of the Green Mountain land represent\r\nan unbroken succession of hardened muds, which rest on sandy muds, and\r\non fine and coarse products of violent volcanic eruptions--tuffs and\r\nagglomerates--and lava flows. No lime-secreting animals could thrive in\r\nthis sea, although they numbered billions in the western waters; for\r\nonly floating plankton could escape the interminable mud, and they\r\ndrifted up and down the coast from Quebec to Connecticut. One or two\r\nstraits may have connected the clear waters of the west with the muddy\r\nwaters of the east, for some of the planktonic organisms have been found\r\nin the muddier sediments of the westerly waterbody.\r\n\r\nThe Cambro-Ordovician sea lapped even older rocks, contorted and cut by\r\nintrusives which bonded them precisely as much younger invading liquid\r\nrock bonded the younger sediments of the Eastern and Western Uplands.\r\nThe older rocks were also laid in a sea--a sea so much more ancient than\r\nthe Cambrian and Ordovician seaways that its shoreline and even its form\r\nand extent are at best conjectural. And when we study these oldest\r\nmarine beds, we find that their ingredients were in part derived from\r\nstill more ancient sedimentary rocks, which accumulated in the sea, and\r\nthat these old beds were elevated into the land that supplied the waste\r\nnow found in the oldest coherent section of rocks in western New\r\nEngland. Indeed, the dawn of the Cambrian period, when life first became\r\nabundant, was merely a half-way mark through geologic time. Although\r\nhalf a billion years have elapsed from the Cambrian to the present,\r\nanother half a billion years reach still farther back towards the\r\nbeginnings of earth history, beyond which science has not yet peered\r\nsuccessfully. These billion years are but a finite segment of history,\r\nbounded by the infinite past and the infinity of the future.\r\n\r\nIt seems appropriate, therefore, to end our journey down the fourth\r\ndimension at this point, and as we retrace our steps, we can profitably\r\nsurvey the chronologic succession of events and scenes which followed\r\neach other from Cambrian time to the Twentieth Century A.D.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                   The Story of Central Massachusetts\r\n\r\n\r\nThe protracted story of central Massachusetts might be that of many\r\nanother section of eastern North America, except for minor details. In\r\nCambrian time an inland sea, well stocked with simple marine organisms,\r\nwashed the shores of an archipelago which extended north and south\r\nthrough the Berkshire Hills, the Green Mountains, and the Notre Dame\r\nMountains. Composed of rocks which themselves had had a long and\r\ninvolved geological past, the islands rose intermittently as streams and\r\nwaves wore them away. Clear water and sandy beaches stretched along\r\ntheir western shore, and the original Adirondack Mountains were just\r\nvisible from the summits of the higher islands. Swift streams raced down\r\ntheir eastern slopes, carrying gravels, sands, and silts into the\r\neastern arm of the sea, and only free-swimming animals could survive in\r\nits turbid waters. For a time, volcanoes erupted and fumed along the\r\nentire eastern coast from Thetford Mines, Quebec, to Plainfield,\r\nMassachusetts, but their activity was short-lived. Only the streams\r\nwhich drained the broad islands endured, and they never ceased to pour\r\nmud into the eastern ocean. Gaps in the island chain permitted some of\r\nthe free-swimming organisms to migrate to the western sea, where\r\nbottom-living plants and animals were actively secreting the limy shells\r\nand skeletons which helped build thick deposits of Cambrian limestone.\r\n\r\nThese conditions continued into the ensuing Ordovician period of\r\ngeologic time, but gradually the situation changed. Again the volcanoes\r\nrenewed their activity, and masses of dark peridotite were intruded\r\nalong the eastern shore; the island chain rose rapidly, and the straits\r\nclosed. The elevated land began to expand outward, and folds spread\r\neastward on the east and westward on the west, like waves from a center\r\nof disturbance. So great was the pressure that portions of the old land\r\nwere sheared outward over the folded sediments. The Taconic disturbance\r\nwas on from the city of Quebec to the city of Washington; and the\r\nstreams, like ants, kept at their endless task of carrying sand and\r\ngravel into any and every depression they could find. They piled up\r\ngreat thicknesses of Silurian sandstone in Maine and New York, and so\r\neffectively did they tear down the Taconic Mountains that the Silurian\r\nsea was ultimately able to penetrate the region from Thetford Mines,\r\nQuebec, almost to White River Junction on the Connecticut River.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 13. _Block diagram showing main features of\r\n    central New England during middle Ordovician time._]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 14. _Block diagram showing main features of\r\n    central New England at the end of Ordovician time._]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 15. _Block diagram showing main features of\r\n    central New England during the Devonian period._]\r\n\r\nOne period later a Devonian sea followed in the wake of the Silurian\r\nsea, but its waters penetrated even farther south to Leverett,\r\nMassachusetts. The quartz gravels of its advancing beach covered the\r\nworn flanks of the Taconic folds. Sea animals left their shells to form\r\na bed of limestone which may be seen today at Bernardston. But again the\r\nsea was shouldered aside by the restive land, which rose from Gaspé to\r\nVirginia. Much of the region affected by the Taconic disturbance was\r\nelevated again, and a broad band of Devonian sediments was folded\r\nclosely through northern New Brunswick, southern Quebec, northern Maine,\r\nnorthern and central New Hampshire, and central Massachusetts. Granites\r\nwelled up into the sediments, and dikes filled all the fissures. The\r\nbaking, stewing, and reinforcing they gave to the older sediments made\r\nthem so firm that they are still one of the most coherent and resistant\r\nseries of rocks in New England and maritime Canada. This was the\r\nShickshock or Acadian disturbance. Meanwhile the first forests took root\r\non the long piedmont plains that spread from the rising mountains\r\nwestward into the Catskill Plateau of New York State (Catskill\r\nsandstone) and eastward to the coast of Maine (Perry formation).\r\n\r\nThe margins of the piedmont plain sank. Vast, luxuriant swamps succeeded\r\nthe old forests in Pennsylvania on the western piedmont, and in Rhode\r\nIsland, Massachusetts, and Acadia on the eastern piedmont. The swamp\r\nvegetation later became the coal seams of eastern North America, and\r\nwell does this time merit its name--the Carboniferous period. The\r\nShickshock Mountains remained in the hinterland forming highlands from\r\nSpencer, Massachusetts, westward into New York State; but they were\r\nshorn of their crags, and only on rare occasions were the streams swift\r\nenough to carry silt into the swamps and to bury the accumulated peat.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 16. _Block diagram showing the main features of\r\n    central New England during the Carboniferous period._]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 17. _Block diagram showing the main features of\r\n    central New England in early Triassic time._]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 18. _Block diagram showing the main features of\r\n    central New England during late Triassic time._]\r\n\r\nTorn and twisted as New England had been by the two previous\r\ndisturbances, it was to suffer yet again. The entire northern section of\r\nthe eastern coal swamps began to rise, and the movement spread southward\r\nthrough New Jersey, eastern Pennsylvania, Maryland, Virginia, the\r\nCarolinas, and Georgia. Granites insinuated themselves once more into\r\nfissures in the elevated landmass; the rocks were pushed outward from\r\nthe raised block; and the sediments of the coal fields were thrown into\r\nfolds which diminished in magnitude towards Ohio on one side and Cape\r\nBreton Island on the other. This was the Appalachian Revolution. When it\r\nwas over, even the youngest sediments were interlaced with granite\r\nsheets and dikes; they were cooked hard in hot spring waters; and they\r\nwere crumpled into close, long north-south folds. The landscape was\r\nchanged completely: mountains had replaced the peat swamps; and from\r\ntheir summits alpine glaciers were plucking rock fragments which they\r\ndumped into the Boston basin. Streams, too, cut deeply into the\r\nmountainous upland, but there were no other local basins in which the\r\nfluvial debris could come to rest.\r\n\r\nThis was, in brief, the course of events which transpired in that era of\r\ngeologic time called the Paleozoic. Twice as long as all ensuing time,\r\nthe era was one of kaleidoscopic change, with placid seas, eruptive\r\nvolcanoes, swift streams, and towering mountains competing for the lead\r\nroles in three rather similar historical cycles. When the Paleozoic era\r\nwas over, the matrix of tough, resistant rocks was ready for the\r\ndelicate inlaid design which was imposed upon it in the Triassic period.\r\n\r\nThere was nothing tranquil about Triassic time. While hot springs, born\r\nin the cooling granites, still oozed from rents in the mountainsides, a\r\ntremendous 100-mile-long rift tore through the east margin of the old\r\nShickshock Mountain foundation. The rift was a clean break at some\r\nplaces, but elsewhere it was splintered and offset. Each northern sector\r\nof the break invariably ended west of the beginning of a southern one,\r\nand the intervening rock is characterized by multiple fissures with more\r\nor less displacement of their walls.\r\n\r\nThe block east of the rift moved south and rose, while that to the west\r\nwas depressed into a tilted and asymmetric basin. Mountain streams\r\nflowing eastward to the Atlantic were caught at the base of the rift,\r\nand a new set of torrents dashed down the west-facing scarp of the\r\nelevated block. After every cloudburst these new streams left their\r\ncontributions of boulders in screes along the east side of the basin.\r\nThe gravels steadily increased in thickness, covering the hills and\r\nvalleys that furrowed the lowland floor. Much of the ancient relief\r\nstill lies buried beneath the fill, but some of the eminences were\r\nexhumed one hundred and fifty million years later and have received\r\nman-given names like Mount Warner and Bernardston Ridge. As the basin\r\nsubsided vertically for more than a mile, the mountain streams spread\r\nfans westward across most of its floor, restricting the contributions of\r\nthe western rivers to a zone which is now less than two miles wide. The\r\nlargest of the eastern rivers wore a valley three miles wide where it\r\nentered the lowland northeast of Granby.\r\n\r\nThen volcanoes broke loose in the basin floor. Lava oozed through the\r\nsand west of the Notch in the Holyoke Range, and it frothed out of the\r\nopenings or was blown violently from them. But by sheer persistence the\r\nrivers still dominated the scene as volcanic activity waxed and waned,\r\nand 1,500 feet of alluvial wash piled up around the volcanic cones. The\r\nenergy of the volcanoes was ultimately spent, but for some time lava\r\npoured out of craters along a line extending southward from the main\r\neruptive center, and from a second center which approximates the course\r\nof the Connecticut River from Sunderland to Turners Falls. It flowed\r\nwestward into the middle of the basin in a series of sheets until it was\r\n400 feet deep; it pressed upward against the sand plains along the\r\nwestern hills; it surged east up the fan slopes where it ended in a\r\nfrothy wall; and it spread southward from these two centers and from\r\nothers to New Haven. The lava, now tilted, gives substance to the\r\nGreenfield Ridge, the Mount Holyoke and Mount Tom Ranges, and the long\r\nline of hills that pass through Hartford and Meriden.\r\n\r\nSpectacular was this outburst in its time, and profound was its\r\ninfluence upon later scenery, but short was its duration. Before weather\r\ncould redden the lava surface, streams washed gravel over it; and only\r\nat the main centers between the Mount Holyoke Hotel and the\r\nAmherst-South Hadley road were the volcanoes able to hold out against\r\nthe relentless activity of running water.\r\n\r\nThe block east of the rift continued to move southward and to rise,\r\nwhile the streams draining it entrenched themselves in an effort to\r\nremain at grade with the basin floor. The moving mountain mass pushed\r\nthe lava flow up on end and twisted its eastern edge around, dragging it\r\nalong to the south. The rock splinters which were formed in the process\r\nsliced the basin sediments into small blocks, some of which can be seen\r\nnorth of Turners Falls and also at the Holyoke Range. Ultimately the\r\nupward and southwestward movement along the rift piled the eastern\r\nblocks against the more westerly ones, pushing the west side of each\r\neastern block up on the east side of the adjacent western one, and\r\ndepressing its eastern side more deeply into the basin floor. The many\r\nfractures which were made weakened the basalt lava sheet along certain\r\nzones where, in recent time, the elements have worn the notches in the\r\nHolyoke Range.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 19. _Block diagram showing the main features of\r\n    central New England at the opening of the Cenozoic era._]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 20. _Block diagram showing the main features of\r\n    central New England at the present time._]\r\n\r\nStreams from the eastern highland stubbornly filled up the holes and\r\nplaned off the raised blocks during the entire period of intermittent\r\nmovement. In the midst of the tussle between earth forces and fluvial\r\nagents the volcanoes again broke into explosive eruptions, and volcanic\r\nash filled many of the block-like depressions all the way from Granby to\r\nlocalities south of Holyoke. Then the fiery vents cooled, and the earth\r\nmovements diminished in their vigor. But they left a mountain front so\r\nsteep that talus and landslide deposits accumulated at its base near\r\nMount Toby; and the block mountain range was so high that glaciers may\r\nhave wreathed its summit. The mountain mass descended southward, and it\r\nwas penetrated by at least one low pass northeast of Granby.\r\n\r\nIn the basin itself, alluvial fans encroached from the eastern mountain\r\nfront, but out in the middle of the valley ephemeral playas and shifting\r\nlakes were numerous. Rushes fringed the lake shores; fish stocked their\r\nwaters; and dinosaurs lumbered over the adjacent flats. The region was\r\none of violent rains and seasonal droughts, of hot days and frosty\r\nnights--a semi-desert country lying in the lee of the Appalachian\r\nranges, somewhat as the intermontane valleys of the West lie in the rain\r\nshadow of bordering mountains. Eight thousand feet of sediments poured\r\ninto the Triassic trough while these conditions lasted, but the\r\nsituation altered slowly as the Jurassic period dawned.\r\n\r\nThroughout earth history, vulcanism and mountain-making have been\r\nspasmodic events; but so long as rain has fallen and water has run\r\ndownhill to the sea, the unspectacular rivers have never relinquished\r\ntheir task of reducing the lands to the lowest grade on which water will\r\nflow. During all of the Jurassic and Cretaceous periods, and even into\r\nthe Eocene epoch of the Tertiary, New England's rivers worked towards\r\nthis end, and they came as close to attaining their goal as the restless\r\nearth has ever permitted them to do. The region from the Atlantic to the\r\nbases of the Green Mountains and the White Mountains was reduced to a\r\nbroad, faintly terraced erosional plain. Not all of it was leveled, for\r\nMount Wachusett, Mount Monadnock, the summits of Mount Greylock and\r\nMount Ascutney resisted the wear and tear of the weather and of running\r\nwater, and retained some of their original stature. At the headwaters of\r\nthe streams the Green Mountain chain and the White Mountains also\r\nwithstood reduction to the common level, forming the divide between St.\r\nLawrence and Atlantic drainage. Such rivers as the Merrimack, the West,\r\nthe Deerfield, and the Farmington followed somewhat different courses\r\nthan they do today, for some of the drainage heading in the Western\r\nUpland of New England flowed straight across the red-rock valley to the\r\nsea.\r\n\r\nDuring Tertiary time the entire region rose vertically as a unit. The\r\nrise was intermittent, punctuated by long stillstands of the upland with\r\nrespect to the sea. One of the earlier uplifts carried the land some 200\r\nfeet higher; and although the rivers maintained their courses, they\r\ndeepened their valleys and ultimately widened them into broad, open\r\nplains far back towards their headwater reaches. In the resistant rocks\r\non either side of the red-rock basin the valleys were sharp and well\r\ndefined, but in the soft Triassic sediments the rivers cut wide swaths,\r\nnearly eliminating the low divides which kept them in their independent\r\ncourses.\r\n\r\nIn Middle Tertiary time renewed uplifts occurred, and ultimately the\r\nstrathed surface was elevated 1,800 feet inland at the Green Mountain\r\ndivide. Once more the rivers started busily cutting down; but in a\r\nprotracted stillstand, while the New England upland still lacked 700\r\nfeet of its present elevation, the Atlantic Ocean planed off the hills\r\nin southern Connecticut as far north as Middletown, and the Farmington\r\nRiver adopted a more direct route across the marine plain to the sea.\r\nBefore the West, Deerfield, and Westfield Rivers could lower their\r\nchannels to grade in the reinforced rocks of the Eastern Upland, a\r\ntributary of the Farmington worked headward along the poorly\r\nconsolidated red rocks of the basin and diverted the waters of the\r\nnorthern streams into its own channel. This was the birth of the\r\nConnecticut River, and in late Tertiary time, the energies of the\r\nnew-born stream were effectively expended widening the whole of the\r\nTriassic basin. Even some of its larger tributaries developed wide\r\nvalley floors with steep walls in the hard crystalline rocks of the\r\nuplands. Only the lava flows and the buried old-rock mountains withstood\r\nplanation in the red-rock basin. The flows form such trap ridges as\r\nGreenfield Ridge, the Mount Holyoke Range, the Mount Tom Range, the\r\nHanging Hills of Meriden. Exhumed mountains are typified by Mount\r\nWarner.\r\n\r\nAll of northeastern North America was raised to great heights in late\r\nPliocene time, and the Atlantic Ocean withdrew at least fifty miles\r\nsoutheastward from the present shoreline. The rejuvenated rivers\r\ndeepened their valleys, forming narrow, sharply incised canyons like the\r\ngorges of the Hudson and the Saguenay; and the Connecticut made a deep\r\ngroove in the lowland floor, cutting to depths which have been partly\r\ndisclosed by drilling at the Calvin Coolidge Memorial Bridge and the\r\nSunderland Bridge.\r\n\r\nWhile the land stood in this high position, one winter's snow in the\r\nWhite Mountains failed to melt before the next began to fall. Snowfall\r\naccumulated upon snowfall, covering not only the White Mountains, but\r\nall of Canada and New England; and the Ice Age was here to stay more or\r\nless continuously for a million years. The ice piled up against the\r\nhighest mountains and ultimately rose so far above them that it slid\r\nover their tops without attempting to detour around them. Its surface\r\nmay have been 13,000 feet above sea level in northern New Hampshire, and\r\nits surface slope, which is estimated at 150 feet per mile, would give a\r\nthickness of 10,000 feet at Northampton. The continent yielded slowly\r\nunder this great load, and it sank until all of the elevation gained in\r\nthe Pliocene movement was wiped out, and more besides. The ice radiated\r\nfrom the centers of maximum accumulation--at first from the White\r\nMountains, and then from northern Ontario, and finally from Labrador.\r\nThe continental glacier crept southward to Long Island and Martha's\r\nVineyard, where its front melted in the waters of the Atlantic as fast\r\nas new ice came up behind. It dragged and pushed and carried debris,\r\nonly to dump it in a hummocky ridge, like a rampart, to mark its\r\nfarthest advance.\r\n\r\nAt last the glaciers started to melt even faster than new masses moved\r\ndown from the north, and the ice front began to recede 400 to 700 feet\r\nper year. The sea followed it, up the Hudson, up the St. Lawrence, in\r\nover the coastal lowlands for a short distance; and everywhere pounding\r\nwaves made beaches at the water line. And in the path of its slow,\r\ndeliberate retreat, the glacier left rock debris--boulders on the hills\r\nand in the valleys, boulders everywhere; all the landscape was marred\r\nand desolate.\r\n\r\nThe ice had weighed the pre-glacial valleys down more deeply in the\r\nnorth than in the south. One such valley was the Connecticut Lowland, in\r\nwhich water gathered to overflow-height at Middletown. Thus Lake\r\nSpringfield came into being, and it spread northward as the ice front\r\nreceded. North of the Holyoke Range another lake formed, and this\r\nnorthern body of water has been named Lake Hadley. Streams flowed off\r\nthe ice, off the hills--flowed with unimpeded vigor, for there were no\r\ntrees or grass to retard the run-off. Deltas grew out from the shores,\r\nand annual layers of clay settled on the lake bed.\r\n\r\nThe ice grew thinner, its area smaller, and its load lighter; and as\r\nMother Earth lost her heavy burden, the land rose, more in the north\r\nthan in the south. The differential rise decanted the water southward\r\nout of the lake basins, and the seas retired from the coastal lowlands.\r\nOld shores and sea beaches remained as flat terraces sloping gently\r\nsouthward. The rivers raced down the steep beach slopes to the old lake\r\nfloors and sea bottom. They cut their channels deeply into the\r\nunconsolidated deltas and meandered back and forth over the flat,\r\nungraded lacustrine plains, as if uncertain where to flow. They flooded\r\nthe lands in the spring, leaving loose sand and silt for the winds to\r\nblow when the water was low. Sand dunes rose near the river banks at\r\nNorth Hadley, Sunderland, Hatfield, and South Deerfield; but the march\r\nof the dunes was arrested as post-glacial vegetation repossessed the\r\nland. It was at this point in the story that man found and settled the\r\nConnecticut Valley, becoming a witness to the geologic work of the river\r\nand an aid to the work of the wind as his plow bared the fertile soil to\r\nthe elements.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                           Interesting Places\r\n\r\n\r\nBooks and periodicals supply dinner menus for the hostess and list\r\ntheatrical offerings for the habitué. Surely suggestions of places for a\r\npicnic or an evening drive are equally in order. Experience, some of it\r\npainful, soon reduces the number of pleasant picnic sites: poison ivy or\r\na deceptive bog may linger in the memory and automatically eliminate\r\nsome otherwise delightful spot. But places suitable to every taste lie\r\nwithin the Connecticut Valley or along its fringing uplands. Some are\r\nnear the highways and others are on woodland trails; a few are\r\ninteresting for their immediate surroundings and many because of their\r\nexpansive view. Here is a landscape which can be appreciated without\r\nleaving or stopping the car; but there is a sight which can be relished\r\nonly from a trail, or from a pinnacle accessible to the agile climber.\r\nDrives satisfy some tastes; but places to stop, meditate, and conjure up\r\nthe past appeal to others. The Valley and its environs have something\r\nfor every temperament and every mood.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Mount Lincoln in Pelham_\r\n\r\nMount Lincoln is remote enough from highways to offer some measure of\r\nretreat, yet it is not discouragingly inaccessible. The summit rises\r\nabout 300 feet above the nearest road, which lies a mile away by\r\nwoodland trail. It is Pelham's highest eminence, and its height is\r\nenhanced by a fire tower which affords a magnificent view in every\r\ncompass direction.\r\n\r\nThe gently undulating New England upland stretches off to the north and\r\neast for miles. The innumerable hills which compose it integrate to form\r\na horizontal skyline, which suggests a flat erosional plane, originally\r\nformed at, or near, the level of the sea. To the northeast Mount\r\nMonadnock in New Hampshire rises prominently above the general level,\r\nfor its extremely resistant rock withstood reduction by weather and\r\nwater more effectively than the weaker bedrock on every side.\r\n\r\nThe valley lowland begins but three miles to the southwest. The range of\r\nhills stretching away like beads on a string is the Holyoke Range. Mount\r\nToby, Mount Sugarloaf, and the Pocumtuck Hills are the prominences in\r\nthe lowland to the northwest. The lowland was eroded out of the New\r\nEngland upland after the land was elevated far back in Tertiary time,\r\nand the disintegrating rock was carried to the sea by the rivers. The\r\nhills in the lowland were left where the rocks resisted destruction more\r\nsuccessfully than elsewhere, but they only approximate the level of the\r\nupland of which they were once a part.\r\n\r\nMount Lincoln and the surrounding hills are strewn with boulders. Every\r\nslope is dotted with large irregularly shaped rocks, many of which have\r\nsmoothed facets marred by minute scratches. The boulders were left by\r\nthe Great Ice Sheet when it melted off New England, and the scratches\r\nwere made when the ice dragged the boulders over hard rock surfaces.\r\nThese stones came down from the north, and among them you may recognize\r\ntypes which you have seen in the ledges around Orange and Northfield.\r\nEarly Pelham settlers found the boulders as much in their way as the\r\ntrees; so they burned or used the trees, and they piled the stones in\r\nlong rows to fence their fields. Stone fences characterize all glaciated\r\nregions, and here they follow the roadsides for miles, reaching to the\r\nedge of the deposits in glacial Lake Hadley.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Mount Toby_\r\n\r\n\"Let's go to Mount Toby\" usually means to go to the camp ground along\r\nRoaring Brook at the east base of the mountain, or to one of the sugar\r\ncamps on the west slope, or to the Sunderland Caves at the north end.\r\nAll of these places are worth knowing, but the view from the mountain\r\ntop deserves at least one trip, and the wood road from Roaring Brook is\r\nreplete with interesting sights.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Pl. 6. _View of the Holyoke Range from Mt.

Pelham asbestos mine\r\n\r\nThe side road to Roaring Brook leaves the highway east of Mount Toby\r\njust north of the old cemetery, and the camp site is on the west side of\r\nthe Central Vermont Railway tracks. The gray rocks east of the tracks\r\nare part of the ancient mountains of Triassic time. Their lofty summits\r\nhave been worn away by the unceasing activity of weather and running\r\nwater, and they are now lower than the fans of waste which was\r\ndischarged from the ancient valleys. Roaring Brook is continuing the\r\nwork of erosion as it tumbles down from Mount Toby, and frost has\r\nloosened the great boulders that lie on the mountainside.\r\n\r\nThe rock along Roaring Brook is very different from that east of the\r\nrailroad. It looks a great deal like concrete, with a large assortment\r\nof aggregate materials mixed in with the cement. The rock is\r\nconglomerate, a mass of coarse stones washed out of the ancient Triassic\r\nmountains, deposited at their base and in contemporary stream valleys,\r\nand then cemented during the ensuing ages. Many of the pebbles in the\r\nconglomerate cannot be found in the old rocks east of the railroad\r\ntracks. Actually these rocks change in character at different levels in\r\nthe uplands of today, and still higher changes which were present in\r\nthis mountain group during Triassic time have been destroyed, though the\r\nrecord of their presence has been retained in the fragments which\r\ncompose the conglomerate.\r\n\r\nThe woodland trail starts up the mountain about 100 yards north of the\r\npicnic grounds. The rock beside it is red granite, and the streams of\r\nTriassic time flowed over it as they carried the gravel which now makes\r\nthe Mount Toby conglomerate. The latter first appears about 100 feet\r\nuphill, and it is virtually the only rock exposed from this point to the\r\nsummit. Interspersed sandstone beds disintegrate easily and form quiet\r\npools and basins in the adjacent brook; the pools end a few feet\r\nupstream where the water cascades over the edge of the next higher\r\nconglomerate stratum.\r\n\r\nMount Toby's summit rises above any other eminence in central\r\nMassachusetts east of Ashfield and south of Mount Grace near Northfield.\r\nFrom it the entire country to the south appears low and flat, except for\r\nthe teeth of the Mount Holyoke Range and the long ridge extending\r\nsouthward from Mount Tom. A slope rises westward from the lowland to\r\nmeet the edge of the flat New England upland along a line that passes\r\nthrough Shelburne, Conway, Goshen, and Granville. East of Toby this same\r\nupland comes so close that it seems but a step across to it.\r\n\r\nMany peaks may be seen rising above the New England upland. The one far\r\nto the east is Wachusett. Up there to the north-northeast are Monadnock\r\nand Mount Grace. Over in the northwest are Stratton and Glastenbury in\r\nVermont, and much nearer and lower is Bald Mountain at Shelburne Falls.\r\nMount Greylock, the highest point in Massachusetts, is almost due west.\r\n\r\nThe lowland was excavated after the New England upland was elevated, and\r\nthe main features which distinguish the present landscape were carved\r\nout before the end of the Miocene epoch of Tertiary time. The high\r\npoints which surmount the upland are monadnocks which, like their\r\nprototype Mount Monadnock, successfully resisted the ravages of time and\r\nNew England's changing but rigorous climate.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Sunderland Caves_\r\n\r\nThe Sunderland Caves are on the northwest side of Mount Toby, just a\r\nshort walk and an easy climb from State Highway 63. They penetrate a\r\ncliff made of conglomerate overlying a shale which accumulated in a\r\nTriassic lake. The shale makes the floor of the cave. Joints, forming a\r\nright angle with the cliff, break the conglomerate into giant blocks.\r\nFrost, smooth shale surfaces, and gravity have caused the two end pieces\r\nto creep away from the other conglomerate blocks. The second block from\r\nthe end has fallen against the end block, forming a high-roofed cave\r\nabout 100 feet long.\r\n\r\nDirectly southwest of the lower entrance to the cave, the shale beds are\r\nhighly distorted along the borders of a trough-like mass of angular\r\nconglomerate or breccia, in which boulders up to six feet in diameter\r\nare numerous. It is believed to be the record of a Triassic landslide,\r\nwhich avalanched down the mountain front immediately to the east, and\r\ninto the old lake at the mountain base. It plowed up the clays in the\r\nlake bed, carried some of them away, and furrowed the others into the\r\ncrumpled forms that are clearly visible along the path to the caves.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Mount Sugarloaf_\r\n\r\nMount Sugarloaf does not offer Mount Lincoln's retreat from crowds nor\r\nMount Toby's expansive landscape, but it is accessible, and it provides\r\nan unrivaled view of the valley between South Deerfield and the Holyoke\r\nRange. Its red sandstones and conglomerates rise almost sheer for 500\r\nfeet above the Sunderland-South Deerfield road. On the northwest and\r\nsoutheast sides the cliffs are determined by nearly vertical joint\r\nplanes. During the Ice Age, the southward-moving glacier plucked away\r\nthe loosely attached blocks facing the South Deerfield and Sunderland\r\nsections of the lowland, leaving Sugarloaf as a remnant between the\r\njoint surfaces.\r\n\r\nThe great bites which the meandering Connecticut River has taken out of\r\nthe lowland are visible east of Sunderland village and south towards\r\nHatfield. Each arc in the edge of the scalloped flood plain is the\r\nextremity of a meander loop which the wandering river carved in its bank\r\nand then abandoned by breaking through the narrow base or tongue, as it\r\ndid at the Northampton ox-bow.\r\n\r\nAn area of low, rolling, sandy hills extends through the pine woods for\r\na mile southward from South Deerfield. The hills are dunes which formed\r\nwhen the Connecticut was picking its channel across the newly exposed\r\nand barren bed of glacial Lake Hadley.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 22. _Meander scarps form a margin to the\r\n    Connecticut River flood plain at Sunderland._]\r\n\r\nThe panorama from the west side of Mount Sugarloaf centers about the\r\ndeep gorge of the Deerfield River. The top of the gorge widens out into\r\na broad strath and affords a glimpse of the more remote upland. The\r\nriver, emerging from this canyon during post-glacial time, built a huge\r\ndelta into glacial Lake Hadley, and much of the delta still remains in\r\nthe terrace which is utilized by the Boston and Maine Railroad as it\r\ndescends into Greenfield.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Turners Falls_\r\n\r\nRushing water has a fascination which was frankly recognized by the\r\nhighway engineers who made the parking place facing the Connecticut\r\nwhere Route 2 passes along the north side of Turners Falls. Here the\r\nriver drops over a series of sandstone ledges into a deep and narrow\r\nchannel at the east base of the trap ridge. Waterfalls are not common in\r\nrivers flowing through lowlands; they indicate disturbances of normal\r\nstream development and sometimes change in course.\r\n\r\nThe Connecticut Lowland is old, but its ancient drainage lines were\r\nburied by the deposits left in glacial Lake Hadley. The river's present\r\ncourse was established upon these lacustrine sediments, and the inner\r\nvalley plain is excavated in them. Before entrenchment took place, the\r\nsouth-flowing reach of the river above Millers Falls was deflected\r\nwestward across the lake plain by the delta of Millers River. It was\r\nturned southward once again by the trap ridge near Turners Falls. The\r\nriver soon cut through the unconsolidated lake beds and found that it\r\nwas out of its pre-glacial channel. The delta of Millers River had\r\ndiverted the water from the old rock valley beneath the Montague sand\r\nplain, across a rock divide, and into the pre-glacial valley of Falls\r\nRiver. The lake-fill in Falls River has been almost completely removed,\r\nand Turners Falls now mark the spot where the Connecticut pours over the\r\nbank and into the channel of its pre-glacial tributary. The falls have\r\nreceded upstream several hundred feet and have cut a deep gash in the\r\nTriassic rocks.\r\n\r\n    Pl. 7. _Gorges, in highland and lowland alike, were formed when the\r\n    rivers were superimposed on coherent rock._\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: a. _View of the Deerfield River gorge emerging on\r\n    valley lowland as seen from Mt. Sugarloaf._]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: b. _View of the French King gorge as seen from the\r\n    bridge._]\r\n\r\nTurners Falls are the product of a series of coincidences. First, the\r\nice sheet and Lake Hadley buried all established drainage lines and\r\nforced the streams to adopt new routes over the bared lake bottom. While\r\nthe lake existed, Millers River threw a weak obstruction in the path of\r\nthe Connecticut, diverting it to that part of the lowland where one of\r\nits pre-glacial tributaries had excavated a slender rock gorge along a\r\nfault plane. The river washed the lake deposits out of the gorge,\r\nexposed the old bank of Falls River, and was busily cutting a new gorge\r\nback into this bank when the dam was constructed and its erosive\r\nactivities were suddenly arrested.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The French King Bridge_\r\n\r\nThe highway from Greenfield to Athol and Fitchburg passes Turners Falls\r\nand crosses the Connecticut River near Millers Falls by way of the\r\nFrench King Bridge. Here the roadway is more than 130 feet above the\r\nwater level. A picnic ground and parking place at the west end of the\r\nbridge make it a particularly attractive place to stop and enjoy the\r\nview upstream towards Northfield.\r\n\r\nThe river occupies a narrow rock gorge for a mile north of the bridge,\r\nbut at that point the valley widens out. This entire section of the\r\nriver's course was established on the old bed of glacial Lake Hadley;\r\nbut after the unconsolidated deposits were washed away, the stream found\r\nitself flowing along the weak contact between the Triassic conglomerate\r\non the west bank and the metamorphic rocks of the highlands on the east\r\nbank. The river deepened its channel on the weak contact zone and made\r\nthe scenic cut over which the bridge was built.\r\n\r\nThe pre-glacial valley lies beneath the sand plain east of the river.\r\nMillers River crosses this old valley between Millers Falls and its\r\nconfluence with the Connecticut, at the east end of the bridge. The\r\nrapids at the junction can be traced to the ridge of crystalline rock\r\nbetween the east bank of the present Connecticut and the west bank of\r\nthe pre-glacial Connecticut. The resistant ledge forms a barrier which\r\nMillers River has not yet eroded to its grade.\r\n\r\nThe conglomerate beds on the west wall of the gorge dip steeply eastward\r\ntowards the river and end against the crystallines. The beds were\r\noriginally laid down with a gentle westward inclination. They were\r\ntilted steeply in the opposite direction against the crystallines by\r\nfaulting, which elevated the ranges and pressed down the adjacent basin\r\nduring Triassic time.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Titan's Piazza and Titan's Pier_\r\n\r\nNot so long ago, giants and the devil received the credit or the blame\r\nfor such oddities in nature as rock-masses broken into six-sided\r\ncolumns. Ireland has its Giant's Causeway, and Yellowstone National Park\r\nits Devil's Post-pile. Titan's Piazza and Titan's Pier were likewise\r\nattributed to activities of the leader of fallen angels and were given\r\nnames appropriate to such an origin by the early settlers. Dr.\r\nHitchcock, in characteristic fashion, undertook the task of correcting\r\nthe errors of puritanical psychology by renaming these places during one\r\nof the early Mountain Day trips from Amherst College. The entire college\r\nbody sojourned to the west end of the Holyoke Range to hear the cliffs\r\nrenamed and their true nature explained.\r\n\r\nDevil or no devil, those huge columns had a hot origin. The dark rock in\r\nthem is part of the main lava sheet which stretches across the valley in\r\nthe Holyoke Range and swings southward in the Nonotuck--Mount Tom Range.\r\nThe lava poured out of a series of volcanoes which were strung out along\r\na fissure about three miles to the east, and the molten mass had a\r\ntemperature of 1200° to 1300° C. The hot lava radiated its heat to the\r\nsandstone below and to the air above; and, as it cooled, it contracted\r\nlike any other substance. The shrinkage was so great that series of\r\ncracks formed in regular pattern, with each crack perpendicular to the\r\ncooling surface. The stresses producing the fissures were equal in all\r\ndirections and would have made circular cracks and cylindrical columns;\r\nbut cylinders have non-cylindrical spaces between them, and the pattern\r\nin which the columns are most nearly cylindrical and yet completely\r\noccupy all space is hexagonal. So contraction broke the lava into\r\nhexagonal columns perpendicular to the cooling surface. The columns are\r\nparallel where the lava floor is regular but are curved or radial where\r\nthe floor is rolling.\r\n\r\n    Pl. 8. _Trap ridges, near and far._\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: a. _View of Titan's Piazza at Hockanum showing the\r\n    columns resting upon the gently inclined sandstone._]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: b. _View of the Springfield lowland from the\r\n    Westfield marble quarry. The Wilbraham Mts. appear in the distance.\r\n    The trap ridge extends through the middle and is breached by the\r\n    Westfield River._]\r\n\r\nThe columns on Titan's Pier lie across the river from the\r\nNorthampton-Holyoke road in the narrow gap at Mount Tom station. The\r\nbasalt flow is inclined 15° southeastward, and the columns stand\r\nperpendicular to the surface--hence they are inclined with respect to\r\nthe water level. Doubtless the devil docked his boat on the gently\r\ninclined rock surface of the cove on the downstream side of the pier.\r\n\r\nTitan's Piazza is situated east of the road to the Mount Holyoke House.\r\nIt is an extremely narrow ledge backed by a stockade of columns. The\r\nfront of the piazza is literally strewn with wreckage from the house,\r\nfor a slope over 100 feet high is covered with angular pieces of basalt\r\nwhich have fallen from the back wall. The lower ends of the columns\r\nbreak off into shallow hexagonal saucers with the concave sides up. Many\r\nhave slid down the slope, to the delight of the birds that bathe in\r\nthem. Higher up the cliff, the saucers become deeper, and towards the\r\ntop the columns scale on into bullet shaped masses.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Westfield Marble Quarry_\r\n\r\nAnyone who drives westward on the Jacob's Ladder route from Springfield\r\npasses first through the open, rolling country of the Connecticut\r\nLowland. Hills are in sight, but they seem remote until he leaves\r\nWestfield, and there the upland rises before him like a 900-foot wall.\r\nThe road uses the gateway cut in the wall by the Westfield River, and\r\nthe drive westward towards the headwaters of the river is one of the\r\nbest known scenic attractions in western Massachusetts. But a greater\r\ntreat awaits the person who will venture southward on the road along the\r\nLittle Westfield River. It follows the canyon brink about 500 feet above\r\nthe stream. Near the hilltop, a side road turns north to the Westfield\r\nMarble quarry, which provides a vantage point overlooking fifty miles of\r\ncountry to the north, east and south.\r\n\r\nThe Westfield River meanders eastward across the flat lowland. Its banks\r\nare terraced, each level cut in the lake beds or in the delta which the\r\nriver built in glacial Lake Springfield. The scalloped margins of the\r\nterraces are the extremities of meander loops which developed when the\r\nriver was not entrenched as deeply in the unconsolidated deposits as it\r\nis today.\r\n\r\nThe flatness of the twenty-mile strip of lowland is impressive, for it\r\nends only at the Wilbraham Mountains, eight miles east of Springfield.\r\nBeneath the lowland lie soft and gently dipping sandstones and sandy\r\nshales, capped by a thin veneer of lake clays and river sands. The\r\nshales are the youngest Triassic beds remaining in the region, and they\r\noutcrop between Thompsonville and Windsor Locks, Connecticut. Younger\r\nshales above them succumbed to Tertiary erosion.\r\n\r\nThe Wilbraham Mountains are granite and gneiss which formed the roots of\r\nthe ancient Triassic ranges. Their present accordant summits are a\r\ntribute to the leveling activities which running water performed on a\r\nquiescent land, whereas the deep V-shaped valleys incised in the level\r\nsummits record uplift and quickened erosion in Tertiary and glacial\r\ntime. Indeed, the lowland itself owes its existence to the power of\r\nrejuvenated streams working on non-resisting rocks.\r\n\r\nThe Holyoke and Mount Tom ranges are visible far to the northeast, and a\r\nchain of low hills connects Tom with the ridges between Hartford and\r\nAvon, Connecticut. These linear hills surmount the lowland because they\r\nare made of basaltic lava, which is better able to resist the rain and\r\nthe weather than the sandstones and shales above and below. Scattered\r\nflat-topped hills between Southwick and Granby are sheets of basalt-like\r\nrock called diabase, which was inserted between a sandstone roof and\r\nfloor. Nowhere can one better appreciate the highly individualized\r\nimprint which each geological element has made upon the central New\r\nEngland landscape.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Old Lead Mines_\r\n\r\nThe colonial period in our nation's history was characterized by an\r\nignorance of its mineral wealth and a dependence upon Europe for most\r\nraw materials, especially essential metals. During the War for\r\nIndependence, European supplies were cut off, and Yankee ingenuity had\r\nto make the most of local deposits of metallic minerals. It was not long\r\nbefore mines were in operation on several lead veins in the Connecticut\r\nValley, yielding a supply of lead for the duration of the war. But the\r\nmines were small, and most of them were soon abandoned, remaining only\r\nas historical sites, or as collecting localities for the mineralogist.\r\nFive of these old deposits are still accessible: four lie west of the\r\nvalley at Loudville, West Farms, Hatfield, and Williamsburg; an\r\nimportant one is situated east of the valley at Leverett. All are very\r\nsimilar in geology and mineralogy, yet each possesses its own\r\nindividuality.\r\n\r\nThe Loudville vein was worked intermittently as late as 1861. It follows\r\na fault fracture between walls of gneiss, but at the southwest end of\r\nthe vein some of the minerals are disseminated through the Triassic\r\nsandstone and conglomerate. This feature indicates that the sediments\r\nwere unconsolidated at the time of mineralization. The fault zone\r\nresembles many analogous fissures which give forth hot mineral-bearing\r\nwaters in the Basin and Range region of Nevada, for the charged waters\r\nhave impregnated the sands which cover the fissures.\r\n\r\nThe Loudville vein contains numerous well-formed crystals. Barite was\r\nthe first mineral deposited, and it is readily recognized as a heavy,\r\neasily scratched substance with one set of cleavage planes at right\r\nangles to two others. Gray metallic galena and resinous cleavable\r\nsphalerite or zinc blende occupy much of the space between the barite\r\nplates. Hard hexagonal crystals or white masses of quartz coat and even\r\nreplace the barite plates. Spike-shaped crystals of calcite and siderite\r\nline many of the cavities and coat the quartz. A patient search will be\r\nrewarded by the finding of other minerals, including pyrite,\r\nchalcopyrite, pyromorphite, wulfenite, malachite and azurite.\r\n\r\nThe old shaft has been closed and the tunnel at the river level has\r\ncollapsed, hence the only exposures are in the open cuts. The most\r\ninteresting is the one at the south end, where the barite plates are\r\ndisseminated through the sandstone.\r\n\r\nAnother series of pits can be found easily about 100 yards west of the\r\nroad to West Farms and about one mile north of the Loudville deposit.\r\nThe vein attains a maximum width of three feet between walls of gneiss,\r\nand it occupies a fault fracture which seems to be continuous with the\r\nLoudville zone. Included in the vein are many fragments of a black\r\nphyllite resembling the Leyden argillite, as well as pieces of gneiss.\r\nThe minerals are identical with those found in the Loudville deposit,\r\nbut the specimens of quartz, galena and sphalerite are more spectacular.\r\n\r\nThe Hatfield vein occurs in a rock of igneous origin, known as the\r\nWilliamsburg granodiorite. It is exposed at the west edge of the valley,\r\nabout 200 feet from Federal Highway 5, at the northern limit of the\r\nsettlement called West Hatfield. The workings are full of water, and the\r\nvery thorough mining activities carried on by mineral collectors and by\r\nSmith College and Amherst classes have reduced the waste pile to\r\nnegligible proportions. Early collections and records reveal that the\r\nvein is essentially like those farther south. At Hatfield, West Farms\r\nand Loudville the fractures do not parallel the systems in the Triassic\r\nsediments and lavas.\r\n\r\nA galena-bearing vein outcrops near the Whately-Williamsburg town line\r\nat the north end of the Northampton reservoir. Leyden argillite forms\r\nthe walls of a fault fissure. Barite is absent from this vein, but fine\r\nquartz, pyrite and chalcopyrite coat the walls. Coarse comb quartz\r\nencrusts the older minerals, together with breccia fragments and cubes\r\nof galena. The vein is remote from the valley and differs in mineralogy\r\nand texture from those within the valley. Other deposits like it have\r\nbeen found in the nearby hills.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 23. _Geologic map of the region in the vicinity\r\n    of the lead veins near Leverett._]\r\n\r\n  1. Only barite in these veins\r\n  2. Best mineral locality\r\n  3. Best place to see fault\r\n  4. Slickensides and tension cracks show direction of movement on\r\n          fracture making opening for vein\r\n  5. Best place to see quartz replacing barite along crush zones in vein\r\n\r\nThe Leverett lead vein is the most interesting of the group because it\r\nis so well exposed that the nature of the vein system is admirably\r\ndisplayed. The deposit lies in a series of overlapping, nearly vertical\r\nfault fissures in gneiss. Slickensides and tension cracks on the walls\r\nof the veins indicate that the movement was nearly horizontal from\r\nnortheast to southwest. Wherever a fracture begins to narrow and close\r\nup, another begins to widen and become conspicuous a few feet to the\r\nnorthwest of it. Several different fissures appear along the length of\r\nthe mineral zone.\r\n\r\nThe same minerals are present as are found in the Loudville, West Farms\r\nand Hatfield veins, but barite is more abundant and quartz less so.\r\nNumerous cavities lined with crystals indicate that the vein formed\r\nclose to the earth's surface. Apparently the minerals entered fractures\r\nsituated near the front of a range that bordered the basin in Triassic\r\ntime. A fault zone so located would lack the great thickness of rock\r\nthat once lay over the gneiss and would be free from any appreciable\r\noverburden of outwash within the Triassic basins.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Dinosaur Tracks Near Holyoke_\r\n\r\nPeople still write from as far away as the Rocky Mountains to ask if the\r\ndinosaur footprints beside the Connecticut River are still in place.\r\nThey are. Anyone may see them in that triangular area between the Boston\r\nand Maine tracks and Federal Highway 5 about one-quarter mile north of\r\nthe entrance to Mountain Park. Marvelous as their preservation from the\r\nassaults of man may seem, it is even more amazing that they should have\r\nbeen preserved in rock at all.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Pl. 9a. _The dinosaur track preserve at Smith's Ferry\r\n    near Holyoke._]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Pl. 9b. _Varved clays or calendar beds on river bank\r\n    south of Hadley._]\r\n\r\nThe footprint beds are shaly sandstones about thirty feet above the\r\nGranby tuff--a bed of volcanic ash formed in late Triassic time. They\r\nare inclined 15° towards the river, and even the higher strata which\r\nform the \"Riffles\" are footprint-bearing. The sandstones are\r\nripple-marked, and they contain worm trails and a few casts of salt\r\ncrystals. Some beds have impressions of reeds. The footprints range from\r\nhalf an inch to ten inches in length, and the stride of the larger\r\nanimals was from five to eight feet. Most of the tracks are headed up\r\nthe present slope, but a few are going in the opposite direction.\r\n\r\nThe sandstones were laid down as almost horizontal beds of sand which\r\nwere occasionally covered and rippled by moving but rather shallow\r\nwater. Rushes and reeds, which have left stray impressions in the rock,\r\ngrew seasonally in the shallow waters, but in between the periodic rains\r\nand floods, the local climate seems to have been quite dry--and probably\r\nvery warm. The sedimentary record suggests a lowland much like some of\r\nthe tropical valleys in the West Indies, lying in the rain shadow of\r\nadjacent mountains.\r\n\r\nThe large tracks invariably have impressions of three toes. Even a\r\ncareful search does not disclose the double tracks which would have been\r\nleft by quadrupeds, and for years the bipedal impressions were called\r\nbird tracks. But birds have spurs which leave a mark behind the middle\r\ntoe; these animals had no spurs and were not birds, but reptiles.\r\nGregarious animals generally follow a leader, and only an occasional\r\nindividual strays from the beaten path. The tracks at Holyoke suggest\r\nthat these Triassic reptiles traveled in small herds.\r\n\r\nThe modern silts of the Connecticut Valley are not a good medium for the\r\npreservation of tracks because they lack coherence, and they drift with\r\nthe wind as soon as they dry. Clays in a region of seasonal aridity are\r\ndifferent. They are baked hard in the hot sun, and the water contains\r\ndissolved mineral matter which crystallizes in the clay and sand as the\r\nwater evaporates, cementing the particles into a rock-like aggregate.\r\nImpressions in this sort of mud are preserved. The Connecticut Valley\r\nhad the right kind of sediment and climate in Triassic time; impressions\r\nof salt crystals can be found in the shales where the tracks are\r\nclearest, not only in this locality but elsewhere in the neighborhood of\r\nHolyoke and West Springfield. These precipitated salts helped hold the\r\nclays together until they were effectively buried, and afterwards a\r\nfirmer cement was deposited around the particles.\r\n\r\nFootprints are known near South Hadley, at Turners Falls, at Gill, and\r\nalong the highway to the French King Bridge; but they do not portray the\r\ncharacter of the animals, their habits and the mode of preservation of\r\ntheir tracks as effectively as the tracks north of Holyoke. Certainly no\r\noccurrence of tracks _in situ_ is as accessible, and no geological\r\nexhibit in New England has received so many visitors.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Fossil Fishing_\r\n\r\nMany years ago men were excavating to lay a foundation for a waterwheel\r\nat what was Whittemore's Ferry, three miles north of Sunderland. They\r\nmade a catch of some of the most ancient fish ever taken in New England,\r\nbut the fish were petrified and did not put up a fight.\r\n\r\nThey were found in layers of black shale, in which skeletons and\r\ncarbonized tissues were well preserved. Of the five genera identified,\r\nall but one were ganoids.\r\n\r\nThe shale accumulated as mud on a Triassic lake bottom, and it was\r\ncovered by a coarse stream-laid gravel which has since been cemented\r\ninto rock. The mud was not eroded by the stream which washed down the\r\ngravel, and the pebbles are not even impressed into the underlying\r\nshale. Apparently the fish perished as the waters evaporated and the\r\nlake became a playa flat. The limited variety of fish suggests that the\r\nconnections with outside regions were restricted, and that living\r\nconditions within the basin were rigorous. The situation may have been\r\nlike that found in the fresh water lakes along the western margin of the\r\nGreat Basin in Nevada and eastern California.\r\n\r\nOther lake deposits with fish remains appear at different levels from\r\nWhittemore's Ferry up to the Sunderland Caves. Each is covered by a\r\nconglomerate layer, and at each place the lake clays had been partially\r\nhardened before the pebbles were washed over them. Seemingly dry\r\nalluvial plains followed transient lakes in kaleidoscopic but cyclic\r\nsuccession.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Calendar Beds_\r\n\r\nThe lakes in which the fish lived and died date back to late Triassic\r\ntime. Much younger were the lakes that followed the continental ice\r\nsheets, and in many valley localities these younger water bodies have\r\nregistered their brief span of geologic life. For they, too, were\r\nsettling basins for clays, which are characterized by annual\r\ndepositional bands like the growth rings in a tree. These clays may be\r\nexamined best in the clay pits at any of the brickyards, particularly at\r\nSouth Hadley Falls, or beside the high river banks rising above the\r\nConnecticut flood plain just south of Hadley.\r\n\r\nThe clays consist of alternating thin, dark, fine bands and thick,\r\nlight, coarser ones. The coarser bands are sandy, and some of them have\r\nripple-marks. The total number of pairs of beds is the number of years\r\nthat glacial Lakes Springfield and Hadley inundated the valley, but it\r\nis not a simple matter to count them. Actually the lake bottom deposits\r\nare but a small fraction of the total volume of material brought to the\r\nlake. Lake shore deposits and deltas grew outward and buried the bottom\r\ndeposits after a few hundred years had passed. Thus in the pits at South\r\nHadley Falls, the clays rest upon glacial gravels, and a scant hundred\r\nlayers intervene between them and the sands above. Shore encroachment is\r\nnot encountered at Hadley, but the shallow depth of the present water\r\ntable hinders deep exploration, and the Fort River has removed many of\r\nthe upper beds.\r\n\r\nLong winters result in thick winter deposits, and heavy spring floods\r\ncause thick sand layers. If the winter of any year is long at\r\nNorthampton, it is usually long everywhere in New England; and if the\r\nConnecticut has floods, most neighboring drainage systems have them,\r\ntoo. In this way, similar layers, or similar successions of layers, are\r\nformed at different places at the same time; and the lake deposits at\r\nWhite River Junction, Deerfield, Hadley, South Hadley Falls, Chicopee\r\nand Springfield may be matched and dated with respect to each other. The\r\ncomplete record in the valley shows that, in the vicinity of the Holyoke\r\nRange, the lake came into existence about 18,000 years ago.\r\n\r\nIn each of the clay pits every set of lines exposed on the working faces\r\nrepresents a year, and the deposit as a whole is a calendar--in fact, it\r\nis also a thermograph for part of the region's post-glacial history.\r\nSome bands at South Hadley Falls and along the Hadley river bank are\r\nhighly distorted, and the distorted layers are planed off smooth. Spring\r\nsand covers the distorted beds. The disturbance can be attributed to ice\r\nwhich froze to the lake bottom and dragged the clay layers as it\r\nexpanded and contracted with changes in temperature.\r\n\r\nLocally the clays are exceptionally hard about certain centers, forming\r\nclay stones or concretions. A willow twig or shell or some organic\r\nsubstance is commonly present at their cores. Groundwater has deposited\r\ncalcium and iron carbonate about the adjacent clay particles and\r\ncemented them into rock.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Holyoke Range_\r\n\r\nFor years it has been a popular outdoor pastime to \"walk the Range.\" The\r\ndistance is neither so great nor the route so rugged that it cannot be\r\ncovered in the course of an afternoon, even if ample time is allotted\r\nfor stops at the many lookouts. The latter provide ever changing views\r\nof the valley from Greenfield and beyond, to Meriden, Connecticut. The\r\nbuildings in Hartford are easily visible on a clear day. The trail\r\nfollows the crest of the Range closely and only rarely leaves the basalt\r\nlava flow. The trip is somewhat less arduous from west to east than it\r\nis in the opposite direction, and the view from Bare Mountain is a\r\npleasant climax for those ending their hike at the Notch.\r\n\r\nAt the toll booth the trail leaves the road which ascends to the Mount\r\nHolyoke Hotel and angles upward along the mountain slope. Overhead the\r\ndark basaltic lava columns rest upon red and white Triassic sandstone,\r\nand the path soon crosses the contact between the two types of rocks. A\r\nshort distance above the contact the trail takes advantage of a col and\r\nclimbs to the top of the ridge. Down the steep southeasterly slope Mount\r\nHolyoke College appears in the distance through a screen of oak trees.\r\n\r\nThe remainder of the climb is gentle, and soon the path enters the\r\nclearing around the hotel. The view is arresting. The Connecticut\r\nemerges from behind Mount Sugarloaf, wanders through the Hadley fields,\r\nflows through the watergap just west of Mount Holyoke, and disappears\r\nfar to the south beyond Springfield. Northampton is spread out below.\r\nAutomobiles on the Hockanum Road look like so many moving dots. The\r\nhills between the Range and South Hadley are made of volcanic ash and\r\nlava; many have pipe-like cores which were the necks of ancient\r\nvolcanoes. Off to the east are higher points on the Range which lie on\r\nthe route to be followed.\r\n\r\nThe path continues along the crest of the range and descends gradually\r\nto the toll road level at Taylor's Notch. Here it is on sandstone, and\r\nthe lava-sandstone contact is exposed on both sides of the gap.\r\nSandstone cliffs rise fifty feet high a few yards down the road; and the\r\nfine arenaceous character of the rock and its bedding are visible at\r\nsome distance.\r\n\r\nThe trail climbs steeply from this col and soon skirts the edge of an\r\nabrupt cliff, in which are carved the initials of many hikers who paused\r\non the ledge to rest and to enjoy the panorama. Eastward the path might\r\nwell serve as the model for a roller coaster in an amusement park. \"The\r\nSisters\" are a series of hills separated by sharp, deep valleys; and no\r\nsooner has one attained a summit than a drop down the other side is in\r\norder. Abrupt 30-foot cliffs trending north and south form many of the\r\nvalley margins; they are smooth joint surfaces where the rock is weak,\r\nand where blocks were plucked out by the great Ice Sheet. Each of \"the\r\nSisters\" has a cleared lookout which affords a new picture of the\r\nHadley-Deerfield lowland to the north.\r\n\r\nThe last lookout is some distance below the succession of summits, and\r\nit affords a view to the east. A cliff drops 200 feet vertically, and\r\nabout one-quarter of a mile farther east other cliffs of red-weathering\r\nbasalt face towards it. Almost all of the broad, low gap between the\r\ncliffs is underlain by a complicated mixture of volcanic ash,\r\nagglomerate and irregular lava flows. The cliff itself is thick columnar\r\nbasalt, and at its base is a coarse sandstone. But the sandstone is thin\r\nand disappears in the depression, whereas the agglomerate and lava\r\nbecome very thick and extend northward to the top of \"Little Tinker\" and\r\nthe \"Tinker.\" They are part of an ancient volcanic cone, buried in\r\nsandstone both to the east and to the west. Flow structures in the main\r\nsheet move away from this center, which is believed to have been one of\r\nthe volcanoes on the line which supplied the basalt for the great lava\r\nfield.\r\n\r\nIn the depression, the trail winds between hills of twisted lava and\r\nconsolidated agglomerate. When the trees are leafed out and the\r\nsurrounding hills concealed, it is easy to imagine oneself on the slope\r\nof a Pacific volcano. The trail divides at the lowest point in the\r\ndepression, and the less used fork goes north to the Bay Road at the\r\nnorthern base of the Range. The other fork ascends Mount Hitchcock, and\r\nat a slight elevation above the low flat it crosses from the agglomerate\r\nto the Holyoke basalt sheet.\r\n\r\nThe best lookout on the Range between the Mount Holyoke Hotel and Bare\r\nMountain is on top of Mount Hitchcock. A side trail leads out to a\r\npromontory, from which one may peer along the face of the Range, look\r\ndown upon the \"Tinker\" and \"Little Tinker,\" and gaze over the lowland\r\nwhich the Connecticut has excavated in the New England upland through\r\nthe long course of geologic time.\r\n\r\nThe east slope of Mount Hitchcock descends steeply, and many a hasty\r\nhiker has made the trip in less time than he intended. The path drops to\r\na flat which measures about 1,000 feet across, and in which the\r\nsandstone lying below the lava sheet is sporadically exposed. Here the\r\nthick basaltic lava has been worn away; and erosion ceases both east and\r\nwest at conspicuous fracture surfaces which locally become fault planes.\r\n\r\nBeyond this low notch the trail leads irregularly upward and eventually\r\ncomes out on Bare Mountain. The top is bare indeed; even scrub oak is\r\nabsent from the summit. The long south slope of the Range is clearly\r\nvisible, and to the west is the Mount Holyoke Hotel where the hike\r\nstarted. The Mount Tom Range, with the Connecticut River at its foot, is\r\njust to the left. Due south are the towers of Mount Holyoke College and\r\nthe cities of Holyoke and Springfield. If the day is clear, the tall\r\nbuildings of Hartford appear in the far distance. Six hundred feet\r\ndirectly below, the highway goes through the Notch, and across the road\r\nis the trap quarry in Notch Mountain, which supplies the crushed stone\r\nfor the local highways. The face of Notch Mountain lies north of the\r\nmain line of the Range because the basalt sheet has been displaced\r\nnorthward between fault planes that bound the eminences on either side.\r\nThe notches utilized by the highway and by the power line are due to\r\nfacile erosion of the crushed rock along the fault planes. Farther to\r\nthe east, Mount Norwottock rises to the greatest height in the Range,\r\nand the view from its summit is at least the equal of that from Bare\r\nMountain. The Hadley lowland stretches northward between the Pelham\r\nHills on the east and the Berkshire Hills on the west, and protruding\r\nabove its relatively flat surface are Mount Warner, Mount Sugarloaf and\r\nMount Toby. The Deerfield gorge trenches the western upland just west of\r\nSugarloaf, and on the skyline is Glastenbury far off in Vermont.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 24. _Diagrams showing the stages in development\r\n    of topography in the vicinity of the Notch._]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: a. _The New England peneplain stage at the Notch._]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: b. _The incoherent rocks are removed from the lava\r\n    flow._]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: c. _The contours of the cliffs are smoothed out._]\r\n\r\nThe downward trail follows the cliff above the highway. The drop is\r\nrapid but not precipitous, and soon the western half of the trail is\r\nbehind.\r\n\r\nThe east end of the Range, especially beyond Mount Norwottock, is less\r\ncommonly visited, but it offers much more of the valley's story. Here\r\nthe Range is more broken than it is in the western half, and the trail\r\nwinds through valleys for much of the distance. Long gentle slopes from\r\nthe west lead to mountain summits, and steep eastern descents take the\r\nhiker into the valleys. Plainly the walk is much easier from west to\r\neast than in the opposite direction.\r\n\r\nThe trail leads from the crusher scales around the north base of Notch\r\nMountain and thence up the power line to the crest of the ridge. The\r\npath lies on conglomerate below the lava sheet through most of the\r\ndistance and returns to the lava only where it bends eastward along the\r\ncrest line. Faulting east of Notch Mountain has moved the base of the\r\nlava southward until it abuts on the sandstone above the lava occurring\r\nwest of the fracture. Thus, the entire backslope of the Range along the\r\npower line is coarse sandstone, whereas in the woods to the east it is\r\nvesicular basaltic lava.\r\n\r\nMany small but abrupt descents occur along the path as it follows the\r\nridge eastward. Each of them marks the position of a minor fault, along\r\nwhich the eastern side has been pushed down and southward under the\r\nwestern side. However, the elevation of the trail increases gradually to\r\nthe summit of Mount Norwottock, which is almost as high as the uplands\r\nbordering the valley. If one can momentarily overlook the lowland\r\nexcavated on the incoherent Triassic sandstones, the regional surface\r\nseems to slope gently upward to the east, the north and the west. Far to\r\nthe east Mount Wachusett rises above the general level, and there in the\r\nnortheast is Monadnock's sharp cone. On the western skyline Mount\r\nGreylock's summit, with the fire tower at the north end, attains\r\nprominence as Massachusett's highest peak. The long ridge of Glastenbury\r\nand the point of Bald Mountain are clearly visible in the northwest. Far\r\nto the south stretches the lowland, and on a clear day Hartford's towers\r\nstand sharp and clear against the sky.\r\n\r\nThe north face of the Range is a sheer 250-foot cliff. The south side is\r\na half-mile-long, 20-degree slope. Eastward the crest terminates in a\r\nprecipitous drop, and the trail winds down the corner between the north\r\nface and the cliffs at the east end. It crosses the contact between the\r\nlava flow and the red Triassic conglomerate about 150 feet below the\r\nsummit. The conglomerate beds are separated by shaly sandstones, many of\r\nwhich have weathered out to make rock shelters; these are the so-called\r\n\"Horse Sheds\" and are said to have been used during Shays' Rebellion.\r\n\r\nThe great cliff at the east end of Norwottock was caused by the rapid\r\nerosion of the sandstones below the lava sheet, which has receded\r\nsteadily westward as it was undermined. Recession started at a fault\r\nplane about halfway between Norwottock and Hilliard Knob, for here\r\ndisplacement pushed the lava down and southward on the east side until\r\nthe subjacent sandstone was exposed west of the fault. Exposure led to\r\nerosion and to recession of the lava cap.\r\n\r\nThe trail passes through the \"Horse Sheds\" to the south base of the\r\nRange, following the contact of the lava with the overlying sandstone\r\nfor about one-half mile on the way towards Hilliard Knob. This eminence\r\nlies over half a mile north of the crest of the Range, for it has been\r\noffset by faulting, much like the displacements near Mount Norwottock\r\nand Notch Mountain, and the trail passes suddenly from the conglomerate\r\nabove the lava flow to the conglomerate below it. Trail markers must be\r\nobserved closely through this section because many wood roads cross the\r\npath.\r\n\r\nEastward the way again leads upward to the lava and follows the crest of\r\na low section of the Range, but soon another fault breaks the continuity\r\nof the ridge, and the high top of Flat Mountain stands out on the far\r\nside of a deep hollow. The hollow is underlain by sandstone below the\r\nlava sheet, and the trail follows down the steep dip slope of the beds,\r\nonly to ascend again towards the reddish basalt cliffs of the mountain.\r\nAt the base of the flow, the bed of a dry brook exposes a mass of frothy\r\nlava.\r\n\r\nThe best views from the top of Flat Mountain are those along the south\r\nslope of the Range towards Mount Tom, and northward across the Hadley\r\nlowland. The path then turns down the north face of the mountain some\r\n200 yards along the crest from the west end and, passing over a series\r\nof conglomerate ledges underlying the lava, it continues along a wood\r\nroad beside a steep-sided brook until it comes to the Bay Road at the\r\nfork to Dwight and Belchertown.\r\n\r\nAny nature lover will find the trail very interesting. The views from\r\nthe western half are unexcelled. Wild flowers and birds abound along the\r\nless frequented eastern section. Anyone wishing to see how molten lavas\r\nand earth movements in the distant past have influenced the topography\r\nof the present will find the far eastern walk a veritable revelation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                         Trips from Northampton\r\n\r\n\r\nNorthampton makes an excellent base for many drives that will gratify\r\nthe lover of scenery, of rocks, or of minerals. The drives range from\r\nten to one hundred miles in length, and any one of them may be extended\r\nor shortened at the whim of the driver. To the east the hard surface of\r\nRoute 9 leads through Amherst, Pelham, and Belchertown; and to the west,\r\nas the Berkshire Trail, it rises to the western upland via Williamsburg\r\nand Goshen. Side roads go to Ashfield and Conway, and permit a return by\r\nway of South Deerfield; or, via Cummington and West Chesterfield, one\r\nmay come back by way of Huntington and Westhampton. Federal Highway 5\r\nfollows the Valley north to Greenfield, whence optional return routes\r\nare available through Shelburne Falls, Conway and South Deerfield in the\r\nwestern upland; or through Orange, Pelham and Amherst in the eastern\r\nupland. Each of these routes offers arresting views of the broad\r\nConnecticut Valley, the picturesque gorges along its margins, and the\r\neven-crested highlands with distant peaks of greater elevation. Indeed,\r\nthe choice of attractive drives is bewildering, even for those who are\r\nhesitant about wandering off the surfaced highways.\r\n\r\nIn the following pages only a few of the possibilities which are\r\navailable to the motorist are described. And for each one chosen, the\r\nstriking views and the significant geological features are indicated, in\r\nthe hope and belief that the traveler may turn explorer and, in\r\nfollowing other byways, may reconstruct for himself many additional\r\ndetails of the region's geologic past.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Northampton, Amherst, Pelham_\r\n\r\nThe route leaves from the Court House corner on Highway 5 and the\r\nexcursion follows Route 9 eastward across the Coolidge Memorial Bridge\r\n(1.3),[1] where a panorama of the floodplain with its many channel scars\r\nand terrace levels is spread out below (see pp. 1-3). Beyond Hadley\r\n(3.0) the road tops the highest river floodplain at a conspicuous\r\nterrace (4.9) and rolls gently over the ancient bed of Lake Hadley. The\r\nshore line of this glacial lake appears as a broad flat between Orchard\r\nStreet and Lincoln Avenue in Amherst (6-9). (See pp. 5-7.)\r\n\r\nThe route turns left at the traffic intersection (7.2) and continues to\r\nthe north end of the common (7.4), where it turns right on the Pelham\r\nroad. This road crosses the lake bottom from the Central Vermont\r\nRailroad tracks (7.9) to the Orient (9.9), where the delta of glacial\r\nOrient Brook made a conspicuous gravel terrace at the farthest limit of\r\nthe lake. Stone fences make their appearance (see pp. 8-9); rocky ledges\r\nand erratics abound at higher elevations, but perched shore lines of\r\nice-margin lakes occur at many levels up Pelham Hill. The road to Mount\r\nLincoln (see pp. 51-52) turns right (11.2) just west of the Amherst\r\nreservoir (11.4). As the road approaches the hilltop (12.9), an opening\r\nwestward through the trees reveals an unusual view of the Holyoke Range;\r\nand the broad lowland valley from Mount Tom in the south to Mount\r\nSugarloaf in the north spreads out below. On the hilltop (13.3) the road\r\nenters the Daniel Shays Highway (13.9). Mount Wachusett (see p. 15) lies\r\nstraight ahead and projects above the great expanse of the New England\r\nupland (see p. 46); Mount Monadnock rises even higher in the northeast,\r\nand everywhere, deep valleys furrow the highland and break its otherwise\r\nmonotonous surface.\r\n\r\nThe Daniel Shays Highway runs north to Athol, where it joins the Mohawk\r\nTrail; but on this trip we shall turn to the right, or south, at Pelham\r\nand follow Federal Highway 202 along the valleys in the Quabbin\r\nreservoir watershed. Pelham gneiss is the most abundant rock along the\r\nhighway, outcropping west of the road (14.1) in a series of\r\neastward-dipping layers that resemble sandstone. Mount Lincoln's fire\r\ntower stands high above the skyline directly west from the power line\r\ncrossing (16.1). The country has a gently rolling form, which was\r\nimposed upon it by the ice sheet (see p. 9), and the miles of stone\r\nfences represent glacial debris piled up by the early settlers in an\r\neffort to bring agricultural order out of geological chaos. Blossoms on\r\nthe wild cherry trees along these fences and the flowering dogwood make\r\nthis a particularly attractive drive in the spring. A ledge of gneiss\r\nwith large eye-shaped crystals of reddish feldspar lies east of the\r\nhighway at 16.3 miles. As the road begins to descend (18.1), a panorama\r\nof the broad lowland between Belchertown and Palmer spreads out below.\r\nView succeeds view as the road drops to lower levels: At one place it is\r\nHolyoke and Springfield; at another it is Belchertown; and finally the\r\nhighway comes to the corners (21.1) where routes lead right to Amherst,\r\nleft to Worcester, and straight ahead through Belchertown to Palmer,\r\nSpringfield and Holyoke.\r\n\r\nThe Granby-Holyoke road (Federal Highway 202) turns right at the south\r\nend of the Belchertown common (22.0). After crossing the railroad\r\n(22.4), it passes out upon the plain of glacial Lake Springfield (25.3)\r\nwhere the stone fences cease to line the roads, because the lake\r\ndeposits cover the glacial boulders. Rocky islands in glacial Lake\r\nSpringfield surmount the flat lacustrine plain (26.9). Granby is\r\nsituated on a long rolling point (28 to 31.6) that is underlain\r\nprincipally by flat-lying arkosic conglomerate, but more ancient\r\ncrystalline rocks appear just a little farther east. In this section the\r\nlake plain is very narrow, and the drop to the Connecticut River Valley\r\nbegins at 32.3 miles and continues to the junction with the South Hadley\r\nroad (33.2), where varved clay (see pp. 4-7) makes its appearance in the\r\npits to the right of the highway.\r\n\r\nThe itinerary of this excursion continues on Federal Highway 202 through\r\nHolyoke in preference to the alternate routes through South Hadley and\r\nthence either by way of Hockanum (p. 85) or via Amherst (pp. 83-84) to\r\nNorthampton. The Holyoke road crosses the Connecticut River (33.8 to\r\n34.1) where the Longmeadow or youngest Triassic sandstone appears in a\r\nseries of serrate ledges between the bridge and the dam at the right.\r\nMud-cracks on some layers and ripple marks on others tell of wet and dry\r\nseasons at the time they were formed. The route turns right just south\r\nof the Holyoke post office (34.6) and right again into Federal Highway 5\r\n(36.2), which parallels the river.\r\n\r\nThe road has been built on a terrace which was once the flat bottom of\r\nglacial Lake Springfield (37.8), but at the north end of the city it\r\ndescends towards the Connecticut River, utilizing the contact between\r\nthe red layers of Longmeadow sandstone and the massive, dark green\r\nGranby tuff with large volcanic bombs that are visible from the road.\r\nThe twin entrances to Mountain Park (38 and 38.2) may tempt the motorist\r\nto indulge in an attractive side trip, but there is enough to occupy him\r\non the main highway. Nearer the river (38.5), a ledge slopes from the\r\nroadway to the railroad tracks and to a series of riffles in the stream.\r\nThis is the Smith's Ferry footprint locality (pp. 66-67), and the\r\nwidened highway and the entrance to the ledges offer an invitation which\r\ncannot be declined (38.6).\r\n\r\nNorth of the dinosaur tracks, road, railroad and river run parallel.\r\nLateral roads are few, but there is a gateway (40.2) into the Mount Tom\r\nReservation. The Granby tuff, which has outcropped persistently on the\r\nwest side of the road, rises to a high bluff and then passes eastward\r\nbeneath the river (40.6). The underlying second lava replaces it in the\r\nroad cuts and is especially conspicuous along the railroad (40.9). The\r\nnext dark gray bluff west of the road (41.4 to 41.6) is part of the\r\nHolyoke flow which caps the Mount Tom and Mount Holyoke ranges (see pp.\r\n26-27). Soon it, too, crosses the river to Titan's Pier (pp. 60-61), and\r\nold residents say that a ledge of it outcropped in the river bed at low\r\nwater before the Holyoke dam raised the water level. Directly ahead,\r\nsouthward-dipping beds of conglomerate outcrop on either side of the\r\nroad (41.0); these beds underlie the lava forming the gentle southern\r\nslopes of the ranges, and their position beneath the trap can be seen\r\nplainly on the steep northern slopes.\r\n\r\nThe road through the Mount Tom Reservation rejoins the highway (42.2)\r\njust south of the outlet from the Oxbow Lake (42.3), the upper end of\r\nwhich also loops 'round and abuts against the highway (42.7). (See\r\np. 3.) Annual floods inundate most of this section, and even the\r\nbanked-up road and railroad periodically go under the swirling waters of\r\nthe swollen river. A sign (43.5) announces that the roadway was 13.5\r\nfeet below water at the height of the 1936 flood, but it is hoped that\r\nthe new dike at the southern limit of Northampton will hereafter turn\r\nthe floods away from the lower sections of the city. Federal Highway 5\r\nbears right (44.0), and the road ahead continues into the Berkshire\r\nTrail. Of passing interest is the fact that a well drilled near this\r\njunction penetrated 3,700 feet of Triassic arkose without reaching the\r\ncrystalline rock floor. The road crosses the unused bed of Mill River\r\n(44.2) and comes once again to the Court House corner in Northampton\r\n(44.6).\r\n\r\n\r\n_Belchertown, Amherst, and Northampton_\r\n\r\nIn our first tour we noted that a road (Route 9) turns right to Amherst\r\nat the south end of the Daniel Shays Highway (21.1), and if we will\r\nreturn to this junction, it will be worth our while to make the Amherst\r\nrun. Just beyond the intersection the highway traverses the level gravel\r\nplain of a nice margin lake (see p. 7) before it descends (22.0) toward\r\nthe Lake Hadley plain. Erratic boulders and stone fences are abundant on\r\nthe slope, and the bedrock is part of the pre-Triassic complex. One very\r\ninteresting pegmatite contains inclusions of contorted schist (23.2).\r\nThe road soon leaves the rocky slopes for the gravel plain of Lake\r\nHadley, but only a short distance northward and westward lie the\r\nBelchertown Ponds, which seem to occupy a large and deep kettle hole\r\narea (see pp. 7-8).\r\n\r\nThe road winds through pine-clad kame terraces, left on the margin of\r\nthe ice which filled the Lake Hadley basin; and where it emerges from\r\nthe woods (24.4), the line of hills making the Holyoke Range may be seen\r\nstretching westward in a series of sharp points. These are the\r\nprojecting edges of the Holyoke lava flow which resisted erosion after\r\nall the softer sediment and volcanic debris flanking it were removed.\r\n\r\nThe road to Mount Lincoln turns right at Pansy Park (24.9), and north of\r\nthis point the Amherst road follows a kame terrace between the Pelham\r\nHills on the right, and the former ice-filled bed of glacial Lake Hadley\r\non the left. Ultimately (27.1) the highway leaves the terrace and drops\r\nto a delta which was deposited in Lake Hadley. The view northward shows\r\nMount Toby and Mount Sugarloaf outlined sharply, and to the east near\r\nthe Orient, the sharp V-shaped notch of the north fork of Fort River\r\ncuts one of the kame terraces. The delta deposit (27.5 to 27.7) shows\r\nexcellent fore-set beds in the gravel pit (27.7), and its entire surface\r\nis dotted with ponds which occupy irregular kettle holes (see pp. 7-8).\r\n\r\nThe highway continues down the delta slope and crosses the Fort River\r\n(28.4). This river established a meandering course upon the bed of Lake\r\nHadley, but its floodplain is now excavated below the level of the lake\r\ndeposits, which form a terrace above the stream. The road passes through\r\nAmherst (30.2) and returns to Northampton (37.4) by the outbound route.\r\n\r\n\r\n_South Hadley, Amherst, Northampton_\r\n\r\nThe route 116 north from the road junction at South Hadley Falls (33.2)\r\nalso has its points of interest. After it passes over the deeply\r\ndissected deposits in Lake Springfield, it rises above the old lake\r\nlevel at the Mount Holyoke campus (35.1) and continues at this higher\r\nelevation beyond the Hockanum-Amherst fork (35.9) in the center of South\r\nHadley. Along the right fork (State Highway 116), which leads to\r\nAmherst, horizontal Longmeadow sandstone outcrops west of the road\r\n(37.1) where the slope to the valley of Bachelor Brook begins. The flat\r\nlake plain extends from Moody's Corner (37.4) to the base of the Holyoke\r\nRange. A gravel road turns right from the highway (38.2) and crosses the\r\nbrook one mile east, and from this locality were excavated many of the\r\nexcellent dinosaur footprints in the Amherst College collection.\r\n\r\nThe lake plain ends at ledges of Granby tuff and agglomerate (38.5). The\r\noutcrops east of the road are grooved with glacial striations, and the\r\nfragmental nature of the rock is clearly revealed in the smooth surface.\r\nLava lies on the tuff west of the road (38.7) and also at the bottom of\r\nthe volcanic series at the Aldrich Lake road (39.0). Coarse\r\nconglomerates make recurrent ridges as far as the base of the Range\r\n(39.5), where the road follows a shelf cut into the Holyoke lava flow\r\njust west of the Notch fault. The conglomerate east of this fault was\r\ndisplaced downward; and as it disintegrates easily, a depression has\r\nbeen cut into the Range east of the road. The quarry situated at the top\r\nof the Range (39.8) just north of the Amherst town line, has brought to\r\nlight many fault fractures that have served the mineral collector well\r\nfor almost a century. The Range trail (see pp. 73-75) westward leaves\r\nthe highway at the town line marker, and the path eastward follows the\r\nold trolley line northeastward from the scales house.\r\n\r\nThe route begins its descent (40.2) through a cut in conglomerate, and\r\nthe entire northern valley is spread out below: Sugarloaf and Toby close\r\nthe eastern side of the view, and hills far up in Vermont form the\r\nbackground in the northwest. The road quickly reaches the flat plain of\r\nLake Hadley (40.7), with apple orchards stretching along its gravel\r\nshore line. The Bay Road crosses the highway (41.1) and parallels the\r\nRange from end to end.\r\n\r\nThe lake deposits fail to conceal many earlier features. Two drumlins\r\n(see p. 9) rise to the east of the road (41.8) near South Amherst. South\r\nAmherst (42.7) is on an island in the old lake; erratic boulders cover\r\nthe hilltop, and bare rocks mark the old wave-washed shore. The highway\r\ncrosses Fort (or Freshman) River (43.8), and at the railroad tracks\r\n(44.6) it rises to the old lake beach, which is continued in the flat\r\nland on the south side of the Amherst College campus. The route turns\r\nleft at Northampton Road (Route 9) and continues to Northampton (52.2).\r\n\r\nThe Hockanum Road (State Highway 63), which follows the left fork at\r\nSouth Hadley (33.2), crosses the Lake Springfield sand plain (34.1) and\r\nrises above the lake level beyond Bachelor Brook (34.3), staying at this\r\nhigher altitude beyond the junction with the Moody's Corner road (35.3).\r\nThe hills directly ahead are tuff, agglomerate and lava, and are\r\nproducts of the last volcanic episode in this region. Dry Brook (35.6)\r\nflows on the sandstone overlying the Holyoke lava sheet, and the latter\r\noutcrops in the road cuts (35.8) and to the left in Titan's Pier (see\r\npp. 60-61). The road to the Mount Holyoke House and Titan's Piazza (see\r\np. 61) turns right (36.0) where the highway breaks through the last of\r\nthe lava mass.\r\n\r\nThe 1936 flood inundated this highway (36.5 to 37.2), and the old\r\nwatermark may still be identified by debris caught in the bushes and\r\nleft on pasture land. The view upstream from the floodplain (37.0) shows\r\nwhere the Connecticut is cutting into its eastern bank and causing it to\r\nrecede (see pp. 1-2). Soon it will penetrate the valley of Fort River.\r\nThe road passes through a woodland on the dissected lake-shore deposits,\r\nbut it soon emerges upon the lake bottom and early river silts (38.6).\r\nThe Bay Road (39.8) enters from the east just south of the bridge over\r\nFort River (39.9). The road joins the outbound route at Hadley (41) and\r\nreturns to Northampton (44).\r\n\r\n\r\n_Holyoke, Easthampton, Northampton_\r\n\r\nThe return from Holyoke (36.2) by way of Easthampton leaves Federal\r\nHighway 5 and rises westward across a ridge of Granby tuff. Several\r\nsmall lakes (36.7) occupy basins on the friable \"second\" sandstone\r\nbetween the \"second\" lava and Granby tuff, which lie immediately to the\r\neast, and the Holyoke lava, which lies below and to the west. The\r\nsandstone is very thin, and the road shortly begins to climb up the dip\r\nslope of the Holyoke lava sheet. Sandstone crops out below the sheet at\r\nthe west base of a low cliff (38.1) which continues northward to the\r\nsouth face of Mount Tom. The Christopher Clark road through the Mount\r\nTom Reservation enters from the north at the summit (38.5); it follows a\r\nscenic route under the west cliffs of the Range to its north end at\r\nMount Nonotuck, where it drops abruptly in a series of hairpin curves to\r\nMount Tom Junction on Federal Highway 5.\r\n\r\nAt the junction of the Easthampton and Christopher Clark roads, a\r\nturn-out offers an opportunity to view the Western Upland, within which,\r\nas it makes its way from Goshen and Williamsburg to Northampton, the\r\nMill River has cut an impressive valley. On the long descent to the base\r\nof the mountain (39.5), the Easthampton road is cut out of coarse\r\narkosic sandstones, but then it levels off abruptly on the flat plain of\r\nglacial Lake Hadley. The lake sediments continue into the center of\r\nEasthampton (41.3), broken only by the shallow valley of the Manhan\r\nRiver. From Easthampton the route utilizes the College Highway (State\r\nHighway 10) to Northampton; and its position on the lake beds affords\r\ngood views of the Range and of the abnormally broad floodplain of the\r\nmeandering Connecticut River in the vicinity of the Oxbow. Just north\r\nand east of the New Haven Railroad's underpass, the river has cut away\r\nthe terrace followed by the road, and this low stretch, like the rest of\r\nthe floodplain, is subject to frequent inundations.\r\n\r\nThe road enters Northampton east of the Smith College campus (45.5) and\r\njoins the Berkshire Trail. A right turn at the traffic light leads to\r\nthe Court House corner (45.7).\r\n\r\n\r\n_Northampton, Hadley, Sunderland, Hatfield_\r\n\r\nThis tour also leaves Northampton by the Coolidge Memorial Bridge, but\r\nat Hadley (3.0) it turns north on State Highway 63 and follows the river\r\nto Sunderland. Here the route recrosses the river, joining Federal\r\nHighway 5 at South Deerfield, and from this point south to Northampton\r\nthe road lies almost literally in the shadow of the western upland.\r\n\r\nIn Hadley (3.0) the road turns north along Center Street and then swings\r\nright at the curve in the Connecticut (3.5). The river bank is lined\r\nwith riprap to resist the current and to prevent the river from washing\r\naway a substantial section of the town. Across the stream in Hatfield\r\nthe Connecticut very nearly achieved the type of destruction which the\r\nresidents of Hadley are trying to escape, and the flood-channel, or\r\n\"washout,\" which was gouged by the swollen stream in the spring of 1936,\r\nmay be seen (4.3) on the way to North Hadley. The road approaches Mount\r\nWarner, whose crystalline rocks appear at the south end of a long, low\r\nspur (4.8) on the edge of the river floodplain. Elsewhere along the base\r\nof the eminence, which scarcely merits the name \"Mount,\" the crystalline\r\nrocks are hidden by a terrace, but they crop out on the higher slopes.\r\nThe younger red Triassic sandstones are present, too, and they may be\r\nseen dipping steeply westward in the brook bed between the bridge (5.9)\r\nand the dam (6.1) at North Hadley.\r\n\r\nSand dunes appear near the river on the outskirts of North Hadley (6.3)\r\nand extend north beyond Mount Warner (7.0) to the point where the road\r\ndrops from the terrace to the floodplain (8.2). Here the former bed of\r\nthe river is occupied by a puny brook, which enters the mainstream on\r\nthe left. The terrace marking the edge of the floodplain lies close to\r\nthe east side of the road for a long distance (8.2 to 9.8) and then\r\nswings a half mile eastward. The road follows a high area between two\r\nabandoned channels formerly used by the river (11.3), until it joins the\r\nAmherst-Sunderland road (11.8) at the southern edge of Sunderland. The\r\nroute turns left in the center of town (12.4), crossing the river\r\nbeneath Mount Sugarloaf, and it continues on to Federal Highway 5 at the\r\ntraffic light in South Deerfield (14.2).\r\n\r\nOn the trip south from the junction, sand dunes appear east of the\r\nrailroad between the Boston & Maine (14.6) and the New Haven crossings\r\n(14.9). The highway is situated on the flat bed of Lake Hadley from this\r\npoint to Hatfield. The road to Whately, which turns west at 16.7, offers\r\nsome attractions. It forks two miles beyond Whately, and the right\r\nbranch leads to the Northampton reservoir and to Haydenville (see\r\np. 89). The left branch follows West Fork Brook and comes back to\r\nFederal Highway 5 at North Hatfield (19.1). Either route provides a\r\nscenic drive over little-frequented gravel roads.\r\n\r\nFrom the main highway the delta built by West Fork Brook into glacial\r\nLake Hadley appears as a flat terrace along the western highland (18.2).\r\nThe rolling fields (19.7) east of the railroad are dunes which were once\r\nraised by the wind along the old Connecticut channel. Mill River, which\r\nrises near Conway, parallels the highway for 6.1 miles and crosses it\r\nhere to enter the Connecticut (20.3). The road approaches the massive\r\ngray rocks of the western upland (20.5), and the Hatfield lead vein (see\r\np. 64) outcrops in a bluff on the right (20.9). The view south (22.3)\r\nshows the water gap between the Mount Holyoke and Mount Tom ranges. At\r\nthe State Police barracks (23.4) the Hatfield road turns left, and a\r\nshort distance beyond (23.9), on the west side of the road, is the\r\nabandoned City Quarry. The granite exposed in the quarry contains a\r\nblack, radio-active mineral called allanite, and each glistening black\r\ncrystal is surrounded by a reddish halo caused by bombardment of the\r\nfeldspar by alpha particles.\r\n\r\nA road to Florence branches right (24.5) near the railroad crossing, and\r\none to the Coolidge Bridge turns left across the Boston & Maine tracks\r\n(24.7). A by-pass to the Berkshire Trail (25.6) goes west, and the tour\r\nreturns to the Court House corner (26.1).\r\n\r\n\r\n_Northampton, Cummington, Plainfield, and South Deerfield_\r\n\r\nThis tour includes a representative section of the Connecticut Lowland,\r\ntraverses rugged valleys on the western margin of the lowland, and\r\ncrosses a wide remnant of the New England upland. The trip is 58.6 miles\r\nlong, and all of it except the last twelve miles moves through rapidly\r\nchanging scenery.\r\n\r\nThe route leaves the Court House corner on State Highway 9, the\r\nBerkshire Trail, following Main and Elm Streets past Smith College. At\r\nthe Cooley Dickinson Hospital the road rises from the bed of glacial\r\nLake Hadley to the Mill River delta, which, despite some dissection,\r\nmaintains the same general level through Florence (2.6) to Look Park\r\n(3.4), where a ridge dotted with glacial erratics rises through it. The\r\nroad follows the delta margin past the Veteran's Hospital and shortly\r\n(4.3) climbs to the land of erratics and stone fences. The road from\r\nWhately (see p. 88) enters from the right in Haydenville (7.1), and the\r\nTrail continues up Mill River to Williamsburg (8.1). Not far beyond the\r\ncenter of Williamsburg the road forks left for Chesterfield and right\r\nfor Cummington.\r\n\r\nThe right hand route climbs a long wooded hill with a deep valley on the\r\nright and occasional cliffs of schist intruded by reinforcing granite\r\ndikes on the left. The view back near the hilltop (12.5) offers, through\r\na frame of trees, a panorama of the Mount Holyoke and Mount Tom Ranges\r\nsurmounting the Connecticut Lowland. The New England upland begins at\r\nthe hilltop (13.1) in Goshen. Just past Goshen Pond (13.6), a road\r\ncontinues straight ahead to Ashfield, and the hard surface of the\r\nBerkshire Trail curves left. Ledges of flaggy Goshen schist outcrop from\r\nGoshen to Swift River (18.4); the banding of the ledges is almost\r\nhorizontal at one place (14.6) and makes excellent flagging for garden\r\nwalks. The west-flowing Swift River tumbles into the deeply entrenched,\r\neast-flowing Westfield River at Swift River village, and the combined\r\nstreams flow due south through a \"door\" in a vertical wall of Goshen\r\nschist so narrow and inconspicuous that the water appears to run\r\ndownhill and then up again. The Berkshire Trail follows up the north\r\nbank of the Westfield River as far as the lower bridge (19.5), at\r\nCummington, where a road to Chesterfield turns left (19.6).\r\n\r\nThe Plainfield road branches off to the right across the river at the\r\ncenter of Cummington (20.5), and it climbs almost continuously from the\r\nWestfield valley to the summit of the New England upland at the\r\nPlainfield corner (24.5). Here the broad, gently rolling expanse of\r\ncountry offers no suggestion of the deep valley only three miles away.\r\n\r\nThe tour takes the road right (Route 116) to Ashfield (33.0), Conway\r\n(40.2), and South Deerfield (46.6), where it turns south on Federal\r\nHighway 5, returning to Northampton (58.6) over ground that is covered\r\nin another tour (see pp. 87-88). The twenty-two miles of country between\r\nPlainfield and South Deerfield contain a succession of highland views,\r\nglimpses into youthfully incised valleys, and a final sweep of\r\nConnecticut lowland that defy description. Nearly everywhere the\r\nglaciers of the Ice Age have scraped away the soil and have exposed the\r\nunderlying metamorphosed sediments. Their high structures and their\r\nmetamorphism show that they are merely the roots of an ancient range\r\nthat once rose majestically to summits which, were they restored, would\r\ndwarf the planed upland of today. Rugged as some of the topography may\r\nseem, prolonged erosion has greatly softened and tamed it. (For more\r\ndetails of the features which can be seen along this route, see pp. 94\r\n-95.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                         Trips from Greenfield\r\n\r\n\r\nThe most popular drive from Greenfield is westward over the Mohawk\r\nTrail, but the eastward continuation of this highway to Orange, combined\r\nwith the Daniel Shays Highway to Pelham, offers almost equal attractions\r\nand should not be missed.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Mohawk Trail, Adams, Plainfield, and South Deerfield_\r\n\r\nThe Mohawk Trail (State Highway 2) heads west from the center of\r\nGreenfield and crosses the Green River (0.6) before climbing out of the\r\nvalley. A lookout (2.1) affords an excellent view of the north end of\r\nthe Connecticut Lowland, and the observation tower on Shelburne Summit\r\n(3.2), situated on a shelf cut out of black Ordovician slate (see pp. 35\r\n-37), provides a broader sweep of central New England scenery. Beyond,\r\nthe upland is gently rolling, trenched by one deep valley at Shelburne\r\nCenter (6.8). The descent into this valley (5.6) offers a glimpse to the\r\nsouth across the Deerfield River gorge, but the road soon rises again,\r\nhovering 300 feet above the sharply incised stream. The Sweetheart\r\nTeahouse (9.9) makes use of one of the ideal sites overlooking the gorge\r\nand river. The highway to Colrain (10.2) continues straight ahead, but\r\nthe Trail turns left across the Deerfield River (10.6) and then right in\r\nShelburne Falls. The road left leads to Conway and South Deerfield.\r\n\r\nThick, almost horizontal bands of gray granite gneiss are exposed in the\r\nroad cuts (11.6) along the south bank of the Deerfield River, but the\r\nentrenched stream has left so little room for the highway that the\r\nlatter soon crosses to the relatively low and more hospitable north bank\r\n(11.9). For many miles the road follows the stream so closely that\r\nspring floods occasionally cover its surface with ice cakes. The drive\r\nalong this stretch to the next bridge (21.0) contains the most restful\r\nscenery on the trip, though the flat open valley is hemmed in by abrupt\r\nslopes which rise for 800 feet. Nor does the flatness of the valley\r\nharmonize with the mountain-structure of the platy Goshen schist, which\r\nstands on edge all along the roadside. Davis Brook (18.7) crosses the\r\nroute, and the road beside it leads up to the Davis Mine, which once did\r\na thriving business extracting iron pyrites for the manufacture of\r\nsulphuric acid.\r\n\r\nOnce more the highway crosses the Deerfield River (21.0) and enters\r\nMohawk Park, which invites the motorist to linger. A mile farther on\r\n(22.0) the road leaves the Deerfield River (22.0) and follows the narrow\r\ngorge of Cold River, which seems scarcely wide enough to accommodate it.\r\nA shady picnic ground and auto camp (23.6) lie just below the narrowest\r\nand deepest part of the gorge (24.5), where the crowding summits seem to\r\ntower high above the puny cars.\r\n\r\nThe road crosses to the north bank of Cold River (25.8) and climbs a\r\nshelf cut into green volcanic schists (25.8 to 27.6). Leaving the gorge\r\n(26.6), it ascends to the upland (29.0), while in view below is the\r\nlaborious route of the Boston and Maine Railroad along the Deerfield and\r\nthence through the east portal of the Hoosac Tunnel near Zoar.\r\n\r\nA lookout (29.4) affords a memorable view of the sharp V-shaped gorge of\r\nthe Deerfield River cut deep into the highland surface, which stretches\r\nunbroken to the horizon, with only a few divides rising to greater\r\nelevations in the west and northeast. A set of broad rock benches, about\r\n200 feet lower than the upland, forms a strath terrace (see pp. 46-47)\r\nwhich closely follows the river's course. Great landslide scars, caused\r\nby the heavy rains accompanying the 1938 hurricane, mar the valley walls\r\nfar to the north and again eastward from Zoar.\r\n\r\nThe road to Zoar (30.2) turns right a short distance east of the\r\nWhitcomb Summit (30.6), where lookout towers at an elevation of 2,240\r\nfeet enhance the excellence of the view westward across other straths to\r\nMount Greylock, the highest point in Massachusetts. From these same\r\nvantage points, one may survey the deceptively smooth slope of the New\r\nEngland upland eastward down the course of the Deerfield towards the\r\nAtlantic coast.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Pl. 10. _View of the Deerfield gorge from the east\r\n    summit of the Mohawk Trail._\r\n\r\n_The high level flat to the extreme right and extreme left is the New\r\nEngland peneplain. The terrace bordering the steep walls of the gorge is\r\na strath._]\r\n\r\nThe road crosses a series of strath heads, which drain into the Cold\r\nRiver, and ascends to the west summit (33.2). At first it seems possible\r\nto throw a stone into North Adams, so abrupt is the western slope. The\r\ncity lies deep in a limestone valley, and beyond it the Taconic ranges\r\nrise steeply west of Williamstown, over six miles away.\r\n\r\nOn the long descent into the valley, the roadway is cut into\r\nalbite-biotite schists with horizontal cleavage. Above and below the\r\nsharp hairpin turn (35.2), there is a beautiful view to the south along\r\nthe strike of the limestone trench and along the route (State Highway 8)\r\nwhich is to be followed from North Adams (37.8) to Adams. Not far south\r\nof North Adams the road passes the west portal of the Hoosac Tunnel\r\n(39.4). Boulders on the mountainside east of the highway are glacial\r\nerratics which were left above the level of the valley trains and above\r\nthe surface of glacial Lake Bascom. The limestone which outcrops on the\r\nslopes of Mount Greylock west of the road is used for lime (41.6), and\r\nthe quarries provide ideal exposures for a study of the rock. The\r\nburning plant (42.2) is at the roadside. The road branches in the center\r\nof Adams (43.6), one route (State Highway 116) continuing ahead to Savoy\r\nand Plainfield, the other veering right to Mount Greylock, Dalton, and\r\nPittsfield.\r\n\r\nThe Savoy road follows a broad valley eastward into the hills. A\r\nperceptible steepening of the slope occurs where it crosses from the\r\ndolomitic limestone below, to the albite-biotite schist above, at a\r\nthrust fault (47.5). Hard white Cheshire quartzite (48.2) and arenaceous\r\nlimestone (49.0 to 49.6) overlie the schist and outcrop by the roadside,\r\nand in places the arenaceous limestone has weathered to a white\r\nglistening sand.\r\n\r\nThe road soon drops into a wide and open valley (50.1) which seems to\r\nslope interminably southeastward; this is the head of the Westfield\r\ndrainage, and it has occupied this position in the Westfield system far\r\nback in geologic time (see p. 14). The little village of Savoy (51.8)\r\nnestles near the eastern edge of the valley, and once beyond the\r\nsettlement, the highway tops a divide (52.7) comprised of rolling hills.\r\nIt skirts Plainfield Pond (56.0 to 56.4) and then comes out upon a\r\npanorama of the upland which embraces the entire Westfield basin (57.5).\r\nThis section is underlain by the Savoy schist, which is characterized by\r\nits many large red garnets. At the hilltop (59.7) in Plainfield the road\r\nforks, the route to the right descending to the Berkshire Trail and the\r\nroad ahead proceeding to Ashfield. This portion of the New England\r\nupland lies so far back from the main streams that the small tributaries\r\nhave not yet cut deeply into its gently rolling surface, and no hint of\r\nhidden valleys can be detected in the peaceful landscape.\r\n\r\nThe Ashfield road traverses woodland country that is almost flat. The\r\nstream valleys are broad and are rarely more than a hundred feet below\r\ndivides. Even Swift River (63.9), which crosses the road about two miles\r\nabove the end of its entrenched gorge, has not deepened its valley,\r\ndespite the long span of years since New England was raised to its\r\npresent elevation (see p. 47). Past the alternate road to Cummington\r\n(64.0), the route continues across the flat country above Ashfield; but\r\nwhere the road to Goshen turns south (66.4), deep dissection of the New\r\nEngland upland begins. An opening in the trees (66.6 to 67.1) discloses\r\nthe valleys along the South River in the vicinity of South Ashfield, as\r\nwell as the level skyline in the highlands east of the Connecticut\r\nValley. The road drops into the South River valley at Ashfield (68.2),\r\nwhere a choice of routes to Greenfield is presented. The road that\r\nfollows the South River to Conway (75.4) is the more interesting.\r\n\r\nThe river is joined by a tributary from the north at South Ashfield\r\n(69.9), and the streams occupy deep but open valleys. Kame terraces\r\nflank the rivers and are a source of gravel for road ballast. The old\r\ndam (73.9) near Conway is a picturesque spot, and the deep, shady pool\r\nbelow is not neglected by anglers. Glacial erratics (see pp. 8-9) dot\r\nthe hill slopes, but ledges are rare and consist of the locally named\r\nConway schist where the rock does appear at the surface. The road\r\nbranches again at Conway: the left fork goes north along the dissected\r\nbrink of the Deerfield gorge to Shelburne Falls, but our choice falls\r\nupon the eastward route to South Deerfield.\r\n\r\nThe highway climbs through a cut (75.8) in contorted, gneissic Conway\r\nschist, which seems to be lined with twisted white quartz veins from\r\nthis point to the margin of the Connecticut Valley. The road levels off\r\njust before it reaches the New England upland, and then it drops through\r\nrolling hill country to the shaded valley of Mill Brook (77.4), which it\r\nfollows to the edge of the lowland (80.1). Rocky ledges are common along\r\nthis swiftly flowing stream. A good view of the Pocumtuck Hills appears\r\non the left (79.7), with the flat plain of the old Deerfield delta\r\nstretching to their base. The road crosses this plain and enters South\r\nDeerfield (81.8).\r\n\r\nThe tour turns north on Federal Highway 5, which is built on the\r\ndeposits spread in glacial Lake Hadley by the Deerfield River from its\r\nmouth eastward to the foot of the Pocumtuck Hills of Triassic\r\nconglomerate. Bloody Brook (82.2) drains this part of the plain. North\r\nof the road which goes through the notch between the Sugarloafs (82.6),\r\nthe delta deposits continue as a terrace along the base of the Pocumtuck\r\nHills as far as Cheapside. But the Deerfield has excavated its\r\npost-glacial delta, and the roadway descends to the meander-cut\r\nfloodplain (84.4 to 88.1), though it rises over one of the meander\r\nscarps (85.1). Remnants of the Deerfield delta form a terrace due west\r\nacross the valley and on the margin of the hills. The entire lowland\r\nnorth of the meander-cut terrace was inundated in 1936, and the water\r\nlevel may still be identified by debris on the railroad embankment on\r\nthe right. Old Deerfield (86.1) itself is on a meander-scarp terrace,\r\nand the 1936 flood line is well marked along it. After the road crosses\r\nthe Deerfield River (88.3), it leaves the floodplain as it climbs to the\r\ncenter of Greenfield (89.8).\r\n\r\n\r\n_Greenfield, Orange, Pelham, Amherst, and Deerfield_\r\n\r\nRoute 2 also leads eastward from Greenfield to the French King Bridge\r\nand Millers Falls. The highway out from Greenfield turns north (0.3)\r\nalong the west front of the trap ridge, near the summit of which several\r\nindividual lava flows are represented by separate sets of columns\r\nsuperimposed one upon the other (see p. 26). The underlying bedded\r\nsandstones outcrop in the lower wooded slopes. A road branches right\r\n(1.7) to Turners Falls and crosses the lava ridge, but the main highway\r\ncontinues straight to a sharp curve near Falls River (3.4).\r\nPillow-shaped masses of lava characterize the bottom of the lava flow\r\nand lie above conglomerate in the bluff to the right. The valley of\r\nFalls River is a fault zone slicing across the lava sheet, which\r\nreappears at the lookout-parking place at Turners Falls (3.5). The\r\nextent to which the waterfall has receded (see pp. 58-59) may be judged\r\nfrom the length of the gorge.\r\n\r\nThe route continues left past the bridge entrance (3.6). Ripple-marked\r\nred shales--once Triassic muds in which stray dinosaurs left their\r\ntracks--outcrop by the roadside (4.6 to 5.7), and coarse conglomerate\r\nbeds (5.9) overlie the shales and dip steeply towards the river.\r\nSomewhat farther east a broad sand plain (6.0 to 6.8) of glacial outwash\r\n(see p. 59), which ends at the French King gorge, buries the Triassic\r\nbedrock, but once again conglomerate appears and forms the west wall of\r\nthe gorge. Pre-Triassic crystalline rocks (6.9) likewise outcrop on the\r\nwestern cliffs, and form a narrow ridge between the present course of\r\nthe river and the pre-glacial channel, which lies below the glacial\r\ndelta (7.0 to 7.9) of Millers River.\r\n\r\nThe road to Northfield turns left (7.9) and another (8.7) leads right to\r\nMillers Falls, but Route 2 continues east, climbing high above the river\r\n(9.9), which flows through a narrow gorge. Gneiss with horizontal\r\nbanding outcrops (11.2) in mesa-like hills north of the highway, which\r\ndescends to a point (12.5) that was 5.5 feet under water during the 1936\r\nflood. The road continues near the water's edge for almost half a mile,\r\nand the narrow gorge through gneiss ends at Erving (13.8). Here the\r\nvalley widens out into a hilly lowland which has been developed on\r\nschist with occasional bands of gneiss. The road follows the north bank\r\nof the river across this lowland to Orange (17.9). Route 2 continues to\r\nAthol where the Daniel Shays highway enters from the south, but an\r\nalternate route, which turns right in the center of Orange and crosses\r\nMillers River (18.0), provides a preferable short-cut to the Daniel\r\nShays Highway (21.8). This section of road is lined with stone fences\r\nwhich memorialize the combined labors of the great Ice Sheet and the\r\nearly settlers.\r\n\r\nRoute 32 from Petersham and Worcester enters from the left (22.7) just\r\nbefore the highway dips into the creek bottom at the edge of the Quabbin\r\nbasin. Thence it ascends to the New England upland level, where a\r\nlookout (25.5) affords an expansive view to the east and north, with\r\nMount Monadnock rising prominently on the distant skyline. New Salem\r\n(25.8) is on the hilltop. Hornblende schist outcrops at intervals across\r\nthe broad ridge, and especially near the descent (28.4) southwestward to\r\nanother stream (30.3) which empties into the Quabbin Reservoir. Once\r\nagain the highway climbs rather steadily for three and one-half miles,\r\npassing the Shutesbury road (31.0) on the right, until it reaches\r\nanother lookout (34.6) from which the trenched New England upland\r\nspreads out to the east. Pelham gneiss is the main rock on the broad\r\nridge west of the Quabbin basin, especially in the vicinity of Pelham\r\n(35.2), which gave the rock its name.\r\n\r\nThe tour turns east to Amherst (41.7), following a section which has\r\nbeen described elsewhere (see pp. 78-79). The principal sights include\r\nthe panorama of the Connecticut Lowland and the ice-margin lake\r\ndeposits. The drive from Amherst to Northampton (see pp. 78-79) and from\r\nNorthampton to South Deerfield (see pp. 87-88) on Federal Highway 5 has\r\nlikewise been covered in other tours, but some new features may be seen\r\nalong the shorter route from Amherst to Sunderland.\r\n\r\nThe Sunderland road turns right at the north end of the Amherst common.\r\nIt descends, first, from Amherst Island, in glacial Lake Hadley, to the\r\nold beach at Massachusetts State College (42.6), and then from the beach\r\nto the lake bottom (43.2) north of the campus. The route takes the left\r\nfork in North Amherst (44.2), traverses part of the old lake bed, swings\r\nwest around the Long Plain delta (45.5), and crosses its entrenched\r\nbrook (46.1). Most of the stream's water seeps through the delta sands\r\nand gravels, and emerges in springs at the Fish Hatchery (46.3). Gravel\r\npits across the road furnish an excellent section of the fore-set and\r\ntop-set beds of the delta. The road right (46.8) goes to the delta top\r\neast of Mount Toby, Montague and Turners Falls, but the main highway\r\ncontinues north.\r\n\r\nThe road turns left and then right (47.2), cutting through a beach bar\r\nin glacial Lake Hadley, and passing a sand dune area (47.6) which\r\ndeveloped from the sandy braids in the channel of the Connecticut when\r\nit first established its course on the lake bed (see pp. 4-6). The route\r\ndrops down from a terrace (47.9) to the highest floodplain level of the\r\nConnecticut. Swales (48.3 and 48.5) on this flat represent former river\r\nchannels, and the scalloped embankment to the east records the lateral\r\nswing and undercutting of the meandering river. The North Hadley road\r\n(48.7) enters from the south along a low ridge between two swales, and\r\nafter the sharp right turn into Sunderland (49.2), the road divides, one\r\nfork going north to Montague, the other west across the Sunderland\r\nBridge to South Deerfield.\r\n\r\nThe Sunderland Bridge (49.4 to 49.6) offers a good view downstream along\r\nthe natural levees (see p. 2) and westward to the cliffs of Mount\r\nSugarloaf (see pp. 56-58). The road rises above the floodplain (49.9)\r\nand passes the Sugarloaf trail (50.0) on the right. A right turn into\r\nFederal Highway 5 at South Deerfield (51.0) brings the motorist back to\r\na section of country already described in connection with the Mohawk\r\nTrail tour (see pp. 95-96), and another eight miles of driving brings\r\nhim to Greenfield (59.1).\r\n\r\n\r\n_Greenfield, Turners Falls, Montague, North Amherst_\r\n\r\nA variant of the drive east from Greenfield is available in the route\r\nthat turns right across the Turners Falls Bridge (3.6 to 3.8) and\r\nfollows the east side of the Connecticut Valley southward. The road\r\nturns left in the center of Turners Falls (4.2) and climbs the\r\nembankment which the river excavated in the old lake beds. On the sand\r\nplain above (4.9), the left fork goes to Millers Falls and the right, to\r\nMontague. The Montague road skirts the west side of a low line of hills\r\nwhich terminate at a depression (8.6) on the pre-glacial course of the\r\nConnecticut. The road goes over Saw Mill River (9.4), in the bed of\r\nwhich Triassic conglomerate is exposed. Conglomerate also appears in the\r\nhills directly south, but the older crystalline rocks crop out in an\r\nexhumed ridge to the southwest and in the highlands eastward. The\r\nconglomerates form the south end of a Triassic basin extending from\r\nMount Hermon and Northfield farther up the valley (see p. 26). Beyond\r\nMontague (9.7) Triassic conglomerate appears along the roadside (10.1)\r\nas far as the forks to Sunderland and Millers Falls (10.8).\r\n\r\nThe Millers Falls road follows the foot of a terrace which rises to the\r\nold delta level, and at the next fork (11.0), the route keeps right and\r\ncontinues southward to North Amherst. The delta of the glacial stream\r\nburied many ice cakes which left numerous kettle holes (11.0 to 11.5)\r\nwhen they melted. The stratification of the deposits is displayed in the\r\nmany road cuts. The route crosses the Central Vermont Railroad (11.5)\r\nand follows an old outwash plain southward past the road to Roaring\r\nBrook (13.1) (see p. 54). The tour continues through a narrow stretch in\r\nwhich crystalline rocks predominate, as far as the Long Plain delta\r\n(15.6). Mount Toby rises steeply on the west side of the railroad. A\r\nthird of the way up the mountainside can be seen (13.9) a conspicuous\r\nbench, which consists of an exhumed remnant of the ancient, sloping\r\ngranite mountain front on which the Triassic sediments were laid (see\r\npp. 20-21). The bench level drops northward to the railroad at Roaring\r\nBrook, and southward it crosses the road (14.9). The conglomerate east\r\nof the road (14.9 to 15.3) fills an old mountain valley. A road east\r\n(15.3) goes to Leverett, and the lead vein is located just south of it\r\nat the hilltop.\r\n\r\nThe route skirts the margin of the crystalline rocks and crosses the\r\nrailroad again (15.6). Just beyond the road to Leverett station (16.1)\r\nthe motorist may exercise the option of returning to the Sunderland road\r\n(17.3) by going right across the Long Plain delta and thence to\r\nGreenfield (29.6) via South Deerfield (see p. 95). Or he may extend his\r\ntrip by taking the left fork of the Mount Toby road, which follows the\r\nboundary between the Long Plain delta and the glaciated eastern\r\nhighlands. Boulders and bare ledges feature in the landscape to the\r\neast, whereas the flat delta and the level beach margin (17.9) lie to\r\nthe west. Beyond the limits of the delta lies a series of bare ledges of\r\ngneiss. After crossing Factory Hollow Brook (19.1), the route joins the\r\nSunderland road (19.2) at the center of North Amherst, returning to\r\nGreenfield (34.1) by way of Sunderland and South Deerfield, as before\r\n(see p. 98).\r\n\r\n\r\n_Greenfield, Turners Falls, Montague, Sunderland_\r\n\r\nThe Sunderland road (10.8) just beyond Montague turns right and climbs\r\nthe terrace along the floodplain of Saw Mill River. The plain is the\r\ndelta which this stream built into Lake Hadley. A few rock ridges\r\nproject above it; buried ice has melted to form kettle holes (11.4) (see\r\npp. 7-8); and post-glacial streams have cut valleys in it; yet it\r\npreserves its deltaic form to the old lake margin (11.6). Low shed-like\r\ncliffs occur east of the road (11.9); the overhanging rock is Toby\r\nconglomerate, and the excavated shelter is a gray shale which was laid\r\nin a Triassic lake bed (see pp. 22 and 68). These cliffs recede from the\r\nhighway and end (12.3) at the Sunderland Caves (see p. 55). The route\r\ncontinues downhill and joins the river road on the floodplain of the\r\nConnecticut (14).\r\n\r\nThe road rises over a promontory (14.1) formed by the resistant\r\nDeerfield lava sheet (see p. 26) and then descends to the river\r\nfloodplain and meander-cut terraces (see p. 22), which cross to the east\r\nside of the highway and continue south beyond Sunderland (15.5). In\r\nSunderland junction is made with the longer tour through Amherst (see p.\r\n98), and the return to Greenfield may be made by that route (25.4).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                         Trips from Springfield\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the vicinity of Springfield the most interesting drives are to be\r\nfound on the west side of the Connecticut River, for the comparatively\r\nflat land east of the river is thickly settled and heavily\r\nindustrialized, and geological phenomena are effectively masked. The\r\ncountry to the west offers a display of features which may be traced to\r\nthe activities of the river, to the former presence of glacial Lake\r\nSpringfield, to the prolonged erosion of the Triassic bedrock, and to\r\nthe resistance of the pre-Triassic rocks in the western highland. Almost\r\nany trip will include this entire suite of geological phenomena. The\r\ndistances which are given in the following tours have been taken from\r\nthe west side of the North End Bridge.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Springfield, Holyoke, Easthampton, and Westfield_\r\n\r\nThis route follows north on the floodplain along the river bank via\r\nFederal Highway 5, and the heavy retaining wall is designed to keep the\r\nriver out. The sand promontory which comes to the left side of the road\r\n(0.6) is a remnant of the old lake--bottom deposits. Past the junction\r\nwith the road through West Springfield (0.8), the highway utilizes the\r\nold lake beds, which form a terrace above the present floodplain; but\r\nultimately (1.6) it drops again to the floodplain level, with its many\r\nabandoned channels, although it discreetly stays on one of the higher,\r\nand older, meander-cut terraces. A cut-off to Chicopee turns right\r\n(2.4), but Federal Highway 5 continues north across the meander terraces\r\nto the forks (4.6) which lead to the residential (left) and business\r\n(right) sections of Holyoke.\r\n\r\nHere the main highway climbs steeply from the floodplain to the top of\r\nthe lake deposits. The view north shows the Holyoke Range rising above\r\nthe roofs and chimneys of Holyoke. Lake deposits form a broad flat\r\nbetween the Triassic volcanic ridges which lie to the west and the\r\ntrench cut by the Connecticut River.\r\n\r\nThe road from Westfield and the airport (Federal Highway 202) from the\r\nleft, and the road to Easthampton (7.6) turns left from the main\r\nhighway, which continues north. The north route, described under the\r\ntours from Northampton (see pp. 80-82), features the dinosaur tracks and\r\nthe succession of Triassic rocks. The Easthampton road goes past the\r\nsouth end of the Mount Tom Range, and its scenic attractions have been\r\ndealt with elsewhere (see p. 85). Its most interesting sights are the\r\nline of lakes between the two volcanic series and the view from the\r\nsummit of the ridge. Easthampton (12.7) lies on the old lake bottom,\r\nfrom which an impressive view of the palisade of massive columns\r\ncomprising the tilted lava flow of Mount Tom can be obtained.\r\n\r\nAt Easthampton the tour turns south on the College Highway (State 10)\r\ntowards Southampton and Westfield. The road follows the gravel plain\r\nwhich was spread into Lake Hadley by streams flowing out of the western\r\nhighland. The plain is dissected locally by the Manhan River (15.2 and\r\n18.0) which crosses the road twice, and one small valley near\r\nSouthampton (17.1) discloses Triassic arkose buried by the sand. The\r\nroad rises above the lake deposits (17.4) near the Manhan River, and at\r\nonce glacial erratics become numerous. The \"land of stone fences\" forms\r\na narrow divide between the Lake Hadley basin and the Lake Springfield\r\nsand plain (21.1), which extends south to the valley of the Westfield\r\nRiver. The Holyoke road (22.5), which enters from the left, came over\r\nthe trap ridge and across the lake plain.\r\n\r\nAs the College Highway approaches the edge of the Westfield valley\r\n(23.6), it slopes steeply down to the level floor cut by the river. It\r\ncrosses the Westfield (24.5) and comes to the junction (24.9) with the\r\nJacob's Ladder route (Federal Highway 20), which offers another\r\ninteresting sidetrip into the Western Upland.\r\n\r\nThe route continues south to the center of Westfield (25.2), leaving the\r\nCollege Highway at the south end of the common. The Springfield road\r\ngoes around the central square and starts east in the valley which the\r\nmeandering Westfield River carved out of the Lake Springfield sediments.\r\nThe terrace levels and the scalloped pattern of the meander scarps are\r\nconspicuous along the lowland. The highway crosses the Little Westfield\r\nRiver (26.1) and then the Westfield itself (27.0) just beyond the\r\nentrance to Robinson State Park.\r\n\r\nMost mineral collectors will instantly recognize a road turning off to\r\nthe left (27.8) as the way to the Westfield trap quarry. For years this\r\nlocality has been as important a source of specimens to collectors as it\r\nhas been of crushed rock to road-builders. Beyond the quarry road the\r\nvalley narrows, and the terraces close in as the river enters the gap in\r\nthe trap ridge. The black lava flow crosses the river (28.3) at the\r\nWestfield-West Springfield town line, and shortly the upper flow\r\nappears, resting on red shales in both railroad and road cuts (29.1).\r\nActually there are two flows separated by an amygdaloidal band in the\r\nupper lava series at this place. The highway crosses the Boston and\r\nAlbany tracks (29.3) and leaves the river. After passing the junction\r\nwith the Holyoke road (31.0), the highway drops to the upper terrace\r\nlevel on the bed of glacial Lake Springfield (31.4). The upper terrace\r\nis narrow here, and the road soon descends to the meander-cut terraces\r\nof the floodplain (32.1). The road to Memorial Bridge turns right (32.3)\r\nand our route returns to the North End Bridge (32.8).\r\n\r\n\r\n_Westfield to the Westfield Marble Quarry_\r\n\r\nThis is a short drive of 5.7 miles each way from Westfield, with a mile\r\nwalk from the Little Westfield road to the marble quarry. The view of\r\nthe Little Westfield gorge and the entire Connecticut Lowland from\r\nMeriden to Amherst makes this trip well worth taking.\r\n\r\nThe tour leaves Westfield on the Jacob's Ladder road and soon reaches\r\nthe terraced margin (1.6) of the Westfield valley. The numerous benches\r\nalong the stream banks represent temporary flood-plain levels of the\r\nWestfield. The route turns left from the Jacob's Ladder highway (4.0)\r\nand parallels the base of the western highland to the Little Westfield\r\nroad (4.9). Throughout this distance the marble quarry derrick appears\r\non the highland skyline. Our road turns right at the next crossing and\r\nwinds along the edge of the Little Westfield gorge (see pp. 61-62). The\r\nnarrow hill road to the marble quarry turns right (5.7), but it is\r\ninadvisable to drive. The walk is an easy one, and the view at the top\r\nis worth the moderate physical exertion.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             Optional Trips\r\n\r\nIt must be plain, even to the casual reader, that the foregoing pages\r\nhave been written with self-restraint. Many of the luring side roads\r\nwere passed without so much as a pause; trips to the Cobble Mountain\r\nReservoir west of Westfield, and to the Quabbin Reservoir east of\r\nBelchertown have not even been suggested; some of the main highways were\r\nslighted. For anyone who knows the byways and the hidden beauties that\r\ncan be found in reasonably accessible places, this chapter will seem\r\ninadequate and incomplete.\r\n\r\nBut it would take a volume far beyond the scope of this brief guide to\r\ndo justice to the scenery, the geography, and the geologic detail of the\r\nConnecticut Valley and its bordering uplands. The authors can merely ask\r\nthe indulgence of those who would like to know more.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                      Mineral and Rock Collections\r\n\r\n\r\nTravelers are inveterate collectors of mementos, and those who travel up\r\nand down and across the Connecticut Valley and who delve into its\r\ngeologic history may well be interested in gathering records of its\r\npast. The best records are not in notes or printed pamphlets--not even\r\nin this volume on the subject; they are to be found imprinted in the\r\nrocks and minerals themselves. But the value of records is measured\r\nsolely by their utility, and utility is achieved by systematic\r\narrangement. So the authors will venture a few suggestions on collecting\r\nand arranging the minerals and rocks which are present in the valley and\r\nin the bordering uplands.\r\n\r\nOne mineral may come from a vein, which is the record of a fissure\r\nbeneath a hot spring; another comes from a dike, which was a molten\r\nigneous rock. This specimen is a conglomerate or consolidated gravel\r\nwashed into place by an ancient stream; that is a slate which was\r\ntransformed from clay by intense squeezing and shearing. And if these\r\nfour specimens were to constitute the nucleus of a collection, the need\r\nfor classification is apparent. The first two are minerals, which are\r\nsubstances of limited chemical composition and well defined physical\r\nproperties. The last two are rocks, which are aggregates of minerals or\r\nof mineral grains. And the minerals may be further classified according\r\nto their separate modes of origin. So, too, with the rocks. Their\r\nmineral composition indicates some of the conditions which existed where\r\nthe minerals originated; the shapes of the mineral grains reveal the\r\nprocess which moved them to their present site; and the arrangement of\r\ngrains discloses the conditions existing during aggregation at this new\r\nlocality. Mineral make-up, size, shape, and arrangement of the grains\r\nprovide means of recognizing major rock varieties--namely, sedimentary,\r\nigneous and metamorphic types,--and also of reading each rock's history.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              THE MINERALS\r\n\r\nThe vein minerals, which are deposited in conduits for hot spring water,\r\ncommonly possess attractive crystal forms; they include barite, quartz\r\nand amethyst, fluorite, calcite, datolite, galena, sphalerite, pyrite\r\nand others almost too numerous to list. Almost equally attractive\r\ncrystals may be obtained from some metamorphic rocks, in which they have\r\nformed as heat and pressure abetted the growth of certain minerals at\r\nthe expense of their less favored fellows; this group contains garnet,\r\nkyanite, chlorite, amphibole, epidote and many others. Less spectacular\r\nare the minerals resulting from the decay of rocks by percolating\r\nsurface water, such as kaolin, limonite, some calcite, and the\r\nbright-colored copper carbonates. Two additional types of minerals are\r\nformed as the result of normal sedimentary and igneous processes, which\r\nwill be described at length in connection with these two kinds of rocks.\r\nSo, after the rock specimens are sorted from the minerals, the latter\r\nmay profitably be arranged into five groups:\r\n\r\n  1. The Vein Minerals.\r\n  2. The Minerals of Pegmatites and Igneous Rocks.\r\n  3. The Minerals of Metamorphic Rocks.\r\n  4. The Minerals of Soils and Rock Decay.\r\n  5. The Minerals of Sedimentary Rocks.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          _The Vein Minerals_\r\n\r\nThe mineral list which follows is far from complete; it contains only\r\nthose minerals which are most commonly found in casual visits to the\r\nlocalities discussed in connection with the local tours of the\r\nConnecticut Valley. Additional species are listed and described in any\r\ntextbook on mineralogy.\r\n\r\n  QUARTZ is a hard, white or colorless mineral which will scratch glass\r\n  easily. In the technical language of the crystallographer, crystals\r\n  are hexagonal or six-sided prisms, terminated by hexagonal pyramids;\r\n  and the six flat faces which make the sides, together with the six\r\n  triangular faces which form the apex, are readily recognized. Massive\r\n  forms break with a curved or conchoidal fracture and were used by the\r\n  Indians to make arrow-heads. The mineral is very abundant in all the\r\n  lead veins and trap quarries; and in some of the latter, specimens of\r\n  the purple variety of quartz, amethyst, are common. A black, smoky\r\n  variety has been discovered in the pegmatite dikes of the highlands.\r\n  Chemically quartz is the dioxide of silicon (SiO_2).\r\n\r\n  CALCITE breaks along three smooth surfaces or cleavage planes. Each\r\n  surface is rhomb-shaped, and the six rhombic faces fit together into a\r\n  characteristic rhombohedral form. A knife will scratch the mineral\r\n  easily. Calcite is abundant in the white veins of the trap quarries\r\n  and is the principal constituent of the crystalline limestones in the\r\n  Hoosac Valley between North Adams and Pittsfield. Calcite is a\r\n  carbonate of lime (CaCO_3).\r\n\r\n  BARITE resembles calcite because it can be scratched with a knife and\r\n  has three smooth cleavage planes. It differs in having one cleavage\r\n  perpendicular to the other two, which intersect at angles of 78°. The\r\n  mineral is more than four times the weight of an equal volume of\r\n  water, and it feels heavy. It is found in the lead veins at West\r\n  Farms, Hatfield and Leverett. In large quantities it has commercial\r\n  value as a source of the element barium, for it is the sulphate of\r\n  barium (BaSO_4).\r\n\r\n  GALENA is the chief metallic mineral in the veins at Leverett,\r\n  Hatfield and Loudville. It is very heavy and has a metallic gray\r\n  color; it breaks into perfect cubes. A knife scratches it easily and\r\n  crumbles it to a black powder. The mineral is a lead sulphide (PbS).\r\n\r\n  SPHALERITE is a lustrous, resinous brown mineral in these same veins.\r\n  It cleaves into multi-faced fragments and is softer than a knife.\r\n  Chemically it is the sulphide of zinc (ZnS).\r\n\r\n  PYRITE is the deceptive golden-colored, metal-like mineral which has\r\n  earned the name of \"fool's gold.\" It will scratch glass, and it\r\n  crushes to a black powder. The materials in it are iron and sulphur\r\n  (FeS_2).\r\n\r\n  CHALCOPYRITE resembles pyrite but will not scratch glass and has a\r\n  greenish yellow color. It is a compound of copper, iron and sulphur\r\n  (CuFeS_2).\r\n\r\n\r\nThe veins in the Connecticut Valley region contain many other minerals,\r\namong which must be mentioned datolite, natrolite, apophyllite,\r\nthomsonite, fluorite and babbingtonite in the lavas; and siderite,\r\nrhodochrosite, rhodonite, wulfenite and pyromorphite in the older veins\r\nof the highlands.\r\n\r\n\r\n               _Minerals of Pegmatites and Igneous Rocks_\r\n\r\nThe minerals found in pegmatites are legion. More than thirty can be\r\ncollected on any trip to Collins Hill near Portland, Connecticut, or to\r\nthe Ruggles Mine near Grafton Center, New Hampshire. Only the minerals\r\nappearing most commonly in pegmatites are described, but a list of\r\nothers is appended as an aid in consulting a textbook. Igneous rocks\r\ncontain practically the same suite of minerals as pegmatites, but in\r\nsmaller grains.\r\n\r\n  MICROCLINE is a white to flesh-colored feldspar with two almost\r\n  perpendicular cleavages. It will scratch glass or a knife. One\r\n  cleavage face shows a grid of translucent and transparent lines\r\n  intersecting at 90°.\r\n\r\n  ALBITE is the second most abundant feldspar. It is white and may\r\n  generally be recognized by its two cleavage surfaces at 86°. Its\r\n  growth may be likened to piling a series of plates with their surfaces\r\n  parallel to one of the cleavages; during growth the plates are laid\r\n  alternately face up and face down, so that the 86° cleavage edges\r\n  zigzag in and out, forming a surface which, on the average, is\r\n  perpendicular to the growth cleavage surface. The separate plates can\r\n  usually be detected as fine bands or striations. The mineral scratches\r\n  either glass or a knife.\r\n\r\n  MUSCOVITE is the white mica found in tabular crystals that can be\r\n  cleaved into flexible and elastic sheets. It can be scratched and cut\r\n  easily with a knife or shears.\r\n\r\n  BIOTITE is an amber-colored to black mica. Like muscovite it is\r\n  flexible and elastic, but it is slightly more brittle.\r\n\r\n  TOURMALINE crystals occur in triangular prisms with the corners\r\n  bevelled so as to give them a rounded appearance. They lack cleavage,\r\n  are very brittle, and will scratch glass. Black is their usual color,\r\n  but red and green varieties are present in many pegmatites.\r\n\r\n  SPODUMENE crystals are white to pale rose in color, and they occur as\r\n  flattened prisms with bevelled corners. They cleave parallel to the\r\n  surfaces bevelling the corners. The mineral is much harder than a\r\n  knife, and the cleavage surfaces have a lustrous, slightly satiny\r\n  appearance.\r\n\r\n  RADIOACTIVE MINERALS occur in many pegmatites and metamorphic rocks of\r\n  this region. The species which have been formed as a result of recent\r\n  alteration are brilliant golden or green encrustations in cracks or on\r\n  a pitchy-black nucleus. The most abundant ones are uranite, autunite\r\n  and torbernite. Older primary or source minerals are pitchy-black and\r\n  are surrounded by a narrow rusty red zone or \"halo,\" ^1/_1_6 to 1/8\r\n  inch wide; an elongate species resembling a rusty hand-made nail is\r\n  allanite; the more pitchy, irregular-shaped mineral is usually\r\n  uraninite or pitchblende.\r\n\r\n  Other minerals found in pegmatites in the Connecticut Valley region\r\n  include beryl, apatite, zircon, garnet, fluorite and lepidolite.\r\n\r\n  Most of the minerals in normal igneous rocks are too minute to be\r\n  recognized easily, but a few have distinctive characteristics which\r\n  serve to identify them. QUARTZ is a hard, dark, glassy-looking mineral\r\n  without cleavage. ORTHOCLASE and MICROCLINE feldspar are hard,\r\n  flesh-colored (occasionally white) minerals with flat cleavage\r\n  surfaces. The minerals making the white lathlike mosaic on the\r\n  weathered surface of the Range at the Mount Holyoke House are\r\n  LABRADORITE feldspar. They are about ¼ inch long and ^1/_5_0 inch\r\n  thick--too small to permit testing by ordinary physical methods,\r\n  although unweathered pieces have essentially the same physical\r\n  properties as orthoclase and microcline. The MICAS are flaky and\r\n  reflect light like minute pieces of tinfoil; muscovite is white, and\r\n  biotite is amber-colored to black. CHLORITE resembles mica but is less\r\n  lustrous and is dark green.\r\n\r\n  Some minerals of igneous rocks do not appear in pegmatites. Among them\r\n  is OLIVINE, which has almost the same color as chlorite but is harder\r\n  than a knife and is massive or granular. It is commonly associated\r\n  with massive green SERPENTINE, which is softer than a knife. These\r\n  three minerals are especially abundant in rocks found in the vicinity\r\n  of Blandford, Massachusetts, and Dover and Chester, Vermont.\r\n\r\n  AUGITE is a dark brown to black pyroxene which occurs between the\r\n  mosaic of whitish labradorite feldspar prisms in the weathered diabase\r\n  near the Mount Holyoke House.\r\n\r\n  AMPHIBOLE crystals are dark green to black, \"match-shaped\" crystals.\r\n  They have almost the same hardness as a knife and are characterized by\r\n  two cleavages parallel to their length and intersecting at 56°. The\r\n  mineral is also abundant in metamorphic rocks and is frequently\r\n  reported as a \"fossil fern\" from ledges at Charlemont and Shelburne\r\n  Falls.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    _Minerals of Metamorphic Rocks_\r\n\r\nThe principal minerals of metamorphic rocks include many which are\r\nlikewise present in pegmatites and igneous rocks, such as microcline,\r\nalbite, quartz, muscovite, biotite, amphibole, serpentine and\r\ntourmaline. But there are others which are more exclusively metamorphic:\r\n\r\n  GARNET occurs in twelve- or twenty-four-sided red crystals. It is much\r\n  harder than a knife. The geometric form is diagnostic, and crystals up\r\n  to an inch thick are obtainable in Plainfield, Massachusetts, and at\r\n  Grafton, Chester, and Gassetts in Vermont. They occur in a muscovite\r\n  schist, in which the muscovite flakes are wrapped around the\r\n  individual crystals.\r\n\r\n  TALC is a white to pale-green mineral found around the margins of\r\n  intrusive rocks that are rich in olivine and serpentine. It is\r\n  foliated and is so soft that even solid masses will rub off on cloth.\r\n  It is present in the green marble quarry near Westfield.\r\n\r\n  KYANITE is a sky-blue, bladed mineral, with two excellent cleavages at\r\n  nearly 90°, and a good smooth fracture at almost 90° to both. One face\r\n  is harder than a knife and the other two are softer. It is very\r\n  abundant in the country rock southeast of the Westfield marble quarry.\r\n\r\n\r\n                 _The Minerals of Soils and Rock Decay_\r\n\r\nAluminous minerals decay to KAOLINITE, and those with a high iron\r\ncontent alter to LIMONITE. Both these products of decomposition form a\r\nsticky paste in their original forms. Kaolinite is white to yellow, and\r\nlimonite or ochre is yellow to orange. Limonite also appears in\r\norange-colored or brown balls, in icicle-like masses, and in thin beds.\r\nSpecimens have approximately the hardness of a knife. Quartz does not\r\ndecay easily and remains behind in solid granules.\r\n\r\n\r\n                  _The Minerals of Sedimentary Rocks_\r\n\r\nMost sedimentary rocks are formed by the cementation of deposits of\r\ntransported waste, derived from older materials. They may contain\r\nanything. The minerals which undergo rapid decay break down to limonite,\r\nkaolinite and quartz, leaving only the more resistant varieties, which\r\ninclude, in order of decreasing resistance, quartz, microcline,\r\northoclase, albite and muscovite. Less abundant constituents are garnet,\r\ntourmaline, zircon and magnetite.\r\n\r\nCertain kinds of sedimentary rocks may be formed through other\r\nagencies--for example, limestone, which is composed of calcite,\r\ninitially precipitated by lime-secreting organisms or by the evaporation\r\nof lime-charged waters. The effects of organic activity may be seen in\r\nthe limestone near Bernardston, but most of the calcite now present in\r\nthe rocks of western Massachusetts is of vein or metamorphic derivation.\r\nSalt (halite) and gypsum are formed by the evaporation of saline waters,\r\nbut only the vacated casts of salt crystals have been detected in the\r\nTriassic sediments of the valley.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               THE ROCKS\r\n\r\nRocks record three distinct methods which nature employs in the\r\naggregation of minerals. The sedimentary rocks register the work of\r\nwind, water and ice. Deposits left by wind and water are generally\r\nstratified or bedded, and they, together with glacial deposits, are\r\ncomposed of fragments which touch one another and are cemented at the\r\npoints of contact. Igneous rocks record the solidification of hot\r\nliquids which injected themselves into older rocks or filled crevices,\r\nand which, upon cooling, formed masses of closely fitting crystals. The\r\nthird group includes types which are crystalline like the igneous rocks,\r\nand which may be laminated somewhat like the sediments; they show\r\neffects of heating and squeezing until their original forms and even\r\ntheir minerals were changed. These are the metamorphic rocks.\r\n\r\nAnyone who wants an orderly record of geologic history will arrange his\r\nrocks into these three groups--the sedimentary, the igneous, and the\r\nmetamorphic. In the Connecticut Valley the metamorphic rocks reveal the\r\nancient phases of earth history, and the sediments contain the details\r\nof younger or later geological episodes. The igneous rocks have a wider\r\nhistorical range; and, like the other types, they record a long period\r\nof violence and upheaval which seems out of harmony with the placid\r\ncountryside for which they now provide a solid foundation.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        _The Sedimentary Rocks_\r\n\r\nThe sedimentary rocks are built from the disintegrated wreckage of older\r\nones. The products of rock decay are picked up and dragged, or carried\r\nin suspension or solution, by wind, running water, or moving ice. They\r\nare deposited when and where the transporting agent can no longer\r\nfunction. Such rocks are usually layered because the transporting power\r\nof the carrying agent fluctuates. Bands of one kind of material,\r\nseparated by dissimilar materials above and below, are called beds.\r\n\r\nThe bedded or stratified rocks of the Connecticut Valley vary greatly,\r\nfrom the coarse bouldery deposits in Mount Toby to the fine-textured,\r\nred and black laminated beds at Whittemore's Ferry. Conglomerate,\r\narkose, graywacke, shale and even limestone are represented, but there\r\nis little true sandstone. Sandstone is an even-textured, granular rock,\r\nmost commonly composed of cemented quartz grains. Its uniformity of\r\ngrain-size and composition reflects prolonged weathering of the original\r\nrock and good sorting of the fragments as they were transported to their\r\nnew resting place. The sequence of exposure, transportation and\r\ndeposition was too rapid in the ancient Connecticut Valley to permit\r\nappreciable decay and sorting; hence sandstones are absent. Limestones\r\nand salt beds are likewise rare, but the metamorphosed limestones which\r\nare found in the western highlands and in the Berkshire valley\r\ndemonstrate that limestone-forming processes played a significant, if\r\nintermittent, part in the history of the region.\r\n\r\n  CONGLOMERATE is consolidated gravel. Pebbles and boulders of all sizes\r\n  are packed together by the stream which was moving them, and the\r\n  spaces between the larger fragments are filled with the sand that\r\n  settled in from the stream bed. The entire mass is cemented by silica,\r\n  limonite, carbonates or some other substance deposited by percolating\r\n  ground-water. The Devil's football near the Mount Holyoke House is a\r\n  famous piece which was dislodged from the hillside above; and\r\n  excellent specimens may be collected on Mount Toby, on Mount\r\n  Sugarloaf, and in the cut at Mount Tom Junction.\r\n\r\n  ARKOSE resembles conglomerate, but the individual grains consist of\r\n  mineral fragments, among which reddish feldspar is prominent. Quartz\r\n  and mica may be present, too; and all the pieces are\r\n  characteristically angular, commonly ranging from ^1/_1_6 to 1/8 inch\r\n  in size. The rock is red and crumbles easily. Beds of arkose alternate\r\n  with conglomerate on the steep sides of Mount Sugarloaf.\r\n\r\n  GRAYWACKE is light to dark gray in color, and the fragments composing\r\n  it are sand size pieces of older rocks. A few mineral grains, such as\r\n  quartz, may be present, but mica is rare. Graywacke occurs interbedded\r\n  with arkose in some parts of the valley.\r\n\r\n  SHALE is a thinly laminated sediment composed of microscopic quartz,\r\n  feldspar, mica and kaolinite grains. Most shales in the Connecticut\r\n  valley were deposited as muds in old lake beds. Some are red and\r\n  record ephemeral pools, but others show from their black color, their\r\n  coal layers, and their fish skeletons, that the water bodies in which\r\n  they accumulated remained in existence for a comparatively long time.\r\n\r\n  LIMESTONE is a rock composed of calcium carbonate, and it consists\r\n  essentially of an aggregate of calcite crystals or calcite fragments.\r\n  It will give off gas bubbles in a very dilute solution of hydrochloric\r\n  acid, and it exhibits other properties peculiar to the mineral\r\n  calcite. A thin, sandy limestone bed has been identified in several\r\n  sections of Holyoke.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          _The Igneous Rocks_\r\n\r\nIgneous rocks were once molten, and in this hot fluid state some were\r\nextruded at the surface as lava flows. Congealed flows reveal the\r\nmotion, which brought them to their present resting places, in the\r\nbanding and streaks that are so evident in the patterns of steam holes\r\nand minerals; but their massive structure bears witness to stagnation as\r\nthey hardened. Other molten masses insinuated themselves into\r\nunderground openings, where they solidified as intrusives, varying in\r\nsize from small dikes less than an inch wide, to huge masses that can be\r\nmeasured in miles in any direction. Most of the igneous rocks in the\r\nhighlands of western and central Massachusetts are massive intrusive\r\ntypes; light-colored varieties predominate, but some dark-colored dikes\r\ncut the older rocks both east and west of the valley. Dark-colored,\r\nmassive and banded lavas are conspicuous in the ranges within the\r\nvalley.\r\n\r\nIgneous rocks may be divided into three general groups for practical\r\nclassification, and each major group may be further subdivided. Rather\r\nconveniently each of the major groups may be recognized by the prevalent\r\ncolor of its rocks--whether dark, medium-colored, or light. And within\r\neach major classification there may be flows, characterized by banded\r\nstructures and fine textures; small intrusives composed of well formed\r\ncrystals in a fine-grained groundmass; and large intrusives consisting\r\nof goodsized, equi-granular crystals. Not all of these types can be\r\nfound in central Massachusetts, but the variety of igneous rocks is\r\nsurprising and offers some excellent possibilities for the collector.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            _The Dark Rocks_\r\n\r\nThe dark rocks owe their color to iron-bearing minerals like olivine,\r\npyroxene (augite), amphibole and biotite. All of these minerals weather\r\nto a rusty red surface, which is typical of their outcrops at many\r\nplaces.\r\n\r\n  BASALT is a black rock, dense in some places but perforated with\r\n  bubble holes or vesicles, at others. It occurs throughout the length\r\n  of the Holyoke, Tom and Pocumtuck Ranges; and fragments of basalt are\r\n  abundant in the Granby tuff and agglomerate.\r\n\r\n  DIABASE resembles basalt but is distinguished by the thin, short\r\n  crystals embedded in it. These crystals of labradorite feldspar\r\n  resemble pieces of clipped thread, and they sparkle in reflected\r\n  light. Almost all dark-colored dikes and the slowly cooled central\r\n  portions of thick lava flows consist of diabase.\r\n\r\n  PERIDOTITE is a dark green, coarse, granular rock composed of olivine\r\n  and subordinate amounts of pyroxene. It occurs near Westfield and\r\n  Blandford, and at many places in Vermont.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       _The Medium-Colored Rocks_\r\n\r\nThe medium-colored rocks contain approximately the same proportions of\r\nlight- and dark-colored minerals. The dark iron-bearing minerals are\r\nrelatively stable, but the light-gray feldspars decompose to kaolin and\r\ngive the weathered rock a chalky white surface. Surface flows of this\r\ngroup are unknown in central Massachusetts, but the coarsely granular\r\nintrusives are well represented.\r\n\r\n  GRANODIORITE PORPHYRY is a greenish-gray rock occurring in many dikes\r\n  in the western highlands. It has rectangular crystals of andesine\r\n  feldspar up to 1/8 inch across, and these have a dull porcellaneous\r\n  luster. A few dark-green amphibole crystals are only slightly smaller.\r\n  Both feldspars and amphiboles are embedded in a very fine-textured,\r\n  pale greenish groundmass.\r\n\r\n  GRANODIORITE is a gray equigranular rock containing flesh-colored\r\n  microcline feldspar, white andesine feldspar, greenish flakes of\r\n  chlorite, needles of amphibole and sparse grains of brown biotite. All\r\n  crystals are about ^1/_3_2 inch thick and commonly display a parallel\r\n  arrangement. This rock forms huge irregular masses at Williamsburg,\r\n  Whately and Belchertown.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       _The Light-Colored Rocks_\r\n\r\nThe light-colored rocks are well represented by dikes and large masses\r\nbut not by recognizable surface flows in central Massachusetts. Their\r\nexposures have rarely weathered much, because the predominant minerals\r\nare quartz, microcline, orthoclase and albite, which resist decay.\r\n\r\n  QUARTZ PORPHYRY is a light gray rock that is found in dikes. It has\r\n  porcelain-white cleavable feldspars up to 1/8 inch thick, and dark\r\n  glassy quartz of equal size in a granular mass of very fine-grained\r\n  crystals. Intrusives of this type are numerous in the vicinity of\r\n  Whately.\r\n\r\n  GRAY ALBITE GRANITE occurs in many dikes and small irregular masses\r\n  throughout the highlands. All crystals have approximately the same\r\n  size and rarely exceed ^1/_3_2 inch in thickness. They consist of\r\n  white orthoclase and albite, dark sugary quartz, and brown to black\r\n  biotite.\r\n\r\n  RED MICROCLINE GRANITE is found in very large, irregular intrusives in\r\n  the highlands. The crystals are ^1/_1_6 inch or more in thickness. The\r\n  red color is due to the flesh-colored microcline. Quartz is dark and\r\n  glassy, and muscovite is the typical mica.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        _The Metamorphic Rocks_\r\n\r\nMetamorphic rocks were once sedimentary or igneous rocks which have been\r\nchanged by intense pressure, by heat, or by solutions moving through\r\nthem. Pressure usually produces a sheeted or foliated structure along\r\nwhich the rock exhibits a tendency to part--somewhat like the pages in a\r\nbook that was bound before the ink was dry. Percolating solutions may\r\nproduce chemical alterations in the original materials and even\r\ncrystallize new substances along the foliated surfaces within the rock,\r\nmuch as water circulating through cooled soil may solidify to ice and\r\ncause heaving. Many of the rocks in the highlands bordering the\r\nConnecticut Valley are highly foliated or banded in consequence of the\r\nmechanical deformation they suffered when the ancient upland mountain\r\nsystem was created. They include the slates, schists and gneisses. A few\r\nmassive types, like marble, serpentine and soapstone, owe their origins\r\nchiefly to the effects of heat or of the hot, chemically charged\r\nsolutions which permeated them.\r\n\r\n  SLATES are fine-grained rocks characterized by flat, parallel cleavage\r\n  surfaces which usually cross the original sedimentary structure. They\r\n  were formed from shales, by shearing and compression during ancient\r\n  mountain-making movements. Slates crop out beside the station platform\r\n  at Brattleboro, Vermont, and at many places southward along Federal\r\n  Highway 5 to Greenfield.\r\n\r\n  SCHIST is foliated, too, but it is composed largely of cleavable\r\n  minerals, such as chlorite, muscovite, biotite and amphibole, which\r\n  are distributed along the cleavage surfaces. These minerals result\r\n  from the chemical activity of hot solutions circulating along a slaty\r\n  cleavage, re-crystallizing old materials, and bringing in new to make\r\n  these coarse mineral flakes. The schist receives its specific name\r\n  (biotite schist, chlorite schist, etc.) from the mineral which\r\n  accentuates its cleavage structure.\r\n\r\n  A few schists contain large crystals which bulge the schistose\r\n  surfaces outward around them. Garnet is characteristic in this role,\r\n  and a muscovite schist with garnets in it is called a GARNETIFEROUS\r\n  (or garnet-bearing) MUSCOVITE SCHIST. Other minerals with occurrences\r\n  similar to the garnet are microcline, albite, staurolite, amphibole,\r\n  tourmaline, pyrite and magnetite.\r\n\r\n  GNEISS is a banded rock containing cleavable minerals, but it lacks\r\n  the cleavage structure of schist. The cleavable minerals (biotite,\r\n  muscovite, amphibole, etc.) may give the gneiss its specific name, but\r\n  as often as not, the name is derived from the whole mineral\r\n  assemblage, or from an assumed origin, as in the case of granite\r\n  gneiss. As in the igneous rocks, the mineral ensemble is held together\r\n  by interlocked quartz and feldspar grains. Black-banded biotite gneiss\r\n  and hornblende gneiss are the most abundant varieties in the\r\n  neighborhood of the metropolitan reservoir east of Pelham.\r\n\r\n  MARBLE is a granular rock composed of calcite crystals. It is formed\r\n  when heat volatilizes the bituminous coloring agents of ordinary\r\n  limestone and simultaneously causes enlargement of the calcite grains.\r\n  It is the principal rock in the Berkshire Valley in which North Adams,\r\n  Adams and Pittsfield are located.\r\n\r\n  OPHICALCITE is a lime-silicate rock. It is formed by the chemical\r\n  reactions of hot solutions on limestone or marble at considerable\r\n  depth within the earth. The original calcite is converted into\r\n  diopside, garnet, vesuvianite and tremolite, forming a rock that may\r\n  be massive, or which may preserve some of the original bedded\r\n  structure. It is found in association with the crystalline limestone\r\n  and magnetite at the old iron mine, located one mile north of\r\n  Bernardston.\r\n\r\n  SERPENTINE is a dark-green rock made almost exclusively of the mineral\r\n  serpentine. It results from the reaction of hot solutions on olivine\r\n  and pyroxene rocks (peridotites). Serpentinite is present in the\r\n  Westfield marble quarry and at Zoar on the south side of the Deerfield\r\n  River.\r\n\r\n  SOAPSTONE is composed principally of talc. It, too, results from the\r\n  chemical activity of hot solutions ascending through serpentine and\r\n  causing the mineral transformation. Bodies of this material are\r\n  associated with the serpentinite at Westfield and Zoar, and northward\r\n  in sections of Vermont. It is mined for talc, but in colonial days it\r\n  found many uses. The colonists used cross-cut saws to make blocks for\r\n  foot warmers in their sleighs, to control the heat in the old\r\n  wood-fired ovens and to make water pipes before iron and lead were\r\n  available in adequate quantities. Many soapstone articles may be\r\n  seen--and purchased--in Wiggins Country Store and in other good\r\n  antique shops through the valley. One of the most primitive Indian\r\n  cultures in this region utilized soapstone pots, and exhibits are on\r\n  display at both the Springfield Museum of Natural History and the\r\n  Amherst College Museum.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               Conclusion\r\n\r\n\r\nTo anyone who has had the patience to read through the preceding pages\r\nand to reach these concluding remarks, it must be obvious that geology\r\nis not merely a pastime for specialists. It does not take half a dozen\r\ncollege and university degrees to collect rocks and minerals, and to\r\nunderstand what they mean; or to appreciate not alone the beauty, but\r\nalso the long and involved, yet logical, origin of scenery; or to\r\ncomprehend from a rock-cut or cliff the vast changes which have occurred\r\nin the course of geologic time; or to grasp the current significance, as\r\nwell as the historical importance, of such rock and mineral products as\r\nthe trap, the limestone, the pyrite, the lead veins, the soapstone, the\r\nvarved clay, the gravel banks.\r\n\r\nWhether one's interests are practical, historical, acquisitive,\r\nesthetic, philosophical or scientific, the geological features of the\r\nConnecticut Valley possess the variety to gratify them all. One must\r\nindeed be blind if he cannot find something of interest--a hobby--even a\r\nprofession in the geological display spread before him in central\r\nMassachusetts. Let it not be thought that this little volume tells the\r\nwhole story. On the contrary, its authors expect to have a difficult\r\ntime justifying their sins of omission, more particularly because many\r\nof the omissions have been conscious and deliberate. But they trust they\r\nhave left for the reader a wealth of features which he can make his own\r\nby right of discovery.
