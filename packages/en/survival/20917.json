But the subject\r\nis of such vast importance, and the area suitable for grape culture so\r\nlarge, the diversity of soil and climate so great, that I may be\r\npardoned if I still think that I could be of some use to the beginner;\r\nit is for them, and not for my brethren of the craft more learned than\r\nI am, that I write. If they can learn anything from the plain talk of a\r\npractical worker, to help them along in the good work, I am well\r\nrepaid.\r\n\r\nAnother object I have in view is to make grape growing as easy as\r\npossible; and I may be pardoned if I say that, in my opinion, it is a\r\ndefect in all books we have on grape culture, that the manner of\r\npreparing the soil, training, etc., are on too costly a plan to be\r\nfollowed by men of little means. If we are first to trench and prepare\r\nthe soil, at a cost of about $300 per acre, and then pay $200 more for\r\ntrellis, labor, etc., the poor man, he who must work for a living, can\r\nnot afford to raise grapes. And yet it is from the ranks of these\r\nsturdy sons of toil that I would gain my recruits for that peaceful\r\narmy whose sword is the pruning-hook; it is from their honest,\r\nhard-working hands I expect the grandest results. He who has already\r\nwealth enough at command can of course afford to raise grapes with\r\nbone-dust, ashes, and all the fertilizers. He can walk around and give\r\nhis orders, making grape culture an elegant pastime for his leisure\r\nhours, as well as a source of profit. But, being one of the first class\r\nmyself, I had to fight my way up through untold difficulties from the\r\nlowest round of the ladder; had to gain what knowledge I possess from\r\ndear experience, and can therefore sympathize with those who must\r\ncommence without means. It is my earnest desire to save _them_ some of\r\nthe losses which _I_ had to suffer, to lighten their toil by a little\r\nplain advice. If I can succeed in this, my object is accomplished.\r\n\r\nIn nearly all our books on grape culture I notice another defect,\r\nespecially in those published in the East; it is, that they contain a\r\ngreat deal of good advice about grape culture, but very little about\r\nwine-making, and the treatment of wine in the cellar. For us here at\r\nthe West this is an all-important point, and even our Eastern friends,\r\nif they continue to plant grapes at the rate they have done for the\r\nlast few years, will soon glut the market, and will be forced to make\r\nthem into wine. I shall therefore try to give such simple instructions\r\nabout wine-making and its management as will enable every one to make a\r\ngood saleable and drinkable wine, better than nine-tenths of the\r\nforeign wines, which are now sold at two to three dollars per bottle. I\r\nfirmly believe that this continent is destined to be the greatest\r\nwine-producing country in the world; and that the time is not far\r\ndistant when wine, the most wholesome and purest of all stimulating\r\ndrinks, will be within the reach of the common laborer, and take the\r\nplace of the noxious and poisonous liquors which are now the curse of\r\nso many of our laboring men, and have blighted the happiness of so many\r\nhomes. Pure light wine I consider the best temperance agent; but as\r\nlong as bad whisky and brandy continue to be the common drink of its\r\ncitizens we can not hope to accomplish a thorough reform; for human\r\nnature seems to crave and need a stimulant. Let us then try to supply\r\nthe most innocent and healthy one, the exhilarating juice of the grape.\r\n\r\nI have also endeavored throughout to give plain facts, to substantiate\r\nwith plain figures all I assert; and in no case have I allowed fancy to\r\nroam in idle speculations which cannot be demonstrated in practice. I\r\ndo not pretend that my effort is \"the most comprehensive and practical\r\nessay on the grape,\" as some of our friends call their productions, but\r\nI can claim for it strict adherence to truth and actual results.\r\n\r\nI have not thought it necessary to give the botanical description of\r\nthe grape-vine, and the process of hybridizing, etc.; this has already\r\nbeen so well and thoroughly done by my friend FULLER, that I can do no\r\nbetter than refer the scientific reader to his book. I am writing more\r\nfor the practical farmer, and would rather fill what I think a vacancy,\r\nthan repeat what has been so well said by others.\r\n\r\nWith these few remarks, which I thought due to the public and myself, I\r\nleave it to you, brother-winegrowers, to say whether or not I have\r\naccomplished my task. To all and every one who plants a single vine I\r\nwould extend the hand of good fellowship, for he is a laborer in the\r\ngreat work to cover this glorious land of the free with smiling\r\nvineyards, and to make its barren spots flow with noble grape juice,\r\none of the best gifts of an all-bountiful Creator. All hail to you, I\r\ngreet you from _Free_ Missouri.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGRAPE CULTURE\r\n\r\nREMARKS ON ITS HISTORY IN AMERICA, ESPECIALLY AT THE WEST--ITS PROGRESS\r\nAND ITS FUTURE.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn an old chronicle, entitled, \"The Discovery of America in the Tenth\r\nCentury,\" by CHARLES C. PRASTA, published at Stralsund, we find the\r\nfollowing legend:\r\n\r\n\"LEIF, son of ERIC the Red, bought BYARNES' vessel, and manned it with\r\nthirty-five men, among whom was also a German, TYRKER by name, who had\r\nlived a long time with LEIF'S father, who had become very much attached\r\nto him in youth. And they left port at Iceland, in the year of our Lord\r\n1000.\r\n\r\nBut, when they had been at sea several days, a tremendous storm arose,\r\nwhose wild fury made the waves swell mountain high, and threatened to\r\ndestroy the frail vessel. And the storm continued for several days, and\r\nincreased in fury, so that even the stoutest heart quaked with fear;\r\nthey believed that their hour had come, and drifted along at the mercy\r\nof wind and waves. Only LEIF, who had lately been converted to CHRIST\r\nour Lord, stood calmly at the helm and did not fear; but called on Him\r\nwho had walked the water and quieted the billows, with firm faith, that\r\nHe also had power to deliver them, if they but trusted in Him. And,\r\nbehold! while he still spoke to them of the wonderful deeds of the\r\nLord, the clouds cleared away, the storm lulled; and after a few hours\r\nthe sea, calmed down, and rocked the tired and exhausted men into a\r\ndeep and calm sleep. And when they awoke, the next morning, they could\r\nhardly trust their eyes. A beautiful country lay before them, green\r\nhills, covered with beautiful forests--a majestic stream rolled its\r\nbillows into the ocean; and they cast the anchor, and thanked the Lord,\r\nwho had delivered them from death.\r\n\r\nA delightful country it seemed, full of game, and birds of beautiful\r\nplumage; and when they went ashore, they could not resist the\r\ntemptation to explore it. When they returned, after several hours,\r\nTYRKER alone was missing. After waiting some time for his return, LEIF,\r\nwith twelve of his men, went in search of him. But they had not gone\r\nfar, when they met him, laden down with grapes. Upon their enquiry,\r\nwhere he had stayed so long, he answered: \"I did not go far, when I\r\nfound the trees all covered with grapes; and as I was born in a\r\ncountry, whose hills are covered with vineyards, it seemed so much like\r\nhome to me, that I stayed a while and gathered them.\" They had now a\r\ntwofold occupation, to cut timber, and gather grapes; with the latter,\r\nthey loaded the boat. And Leif gave a name to the country, and called\r\nit Vinland, or Wineland.\"\r\n\r\nSo far the tradition. It is said that coming events cast their shadows\r\nbefore them. If this is so, may we not recognize one of those shadows\r\nin the old Norman legend of events which transpired more than eight\r\nhundred years ago? Is it not the foreshadowing of the destiny of this\r\ngreat continent, to become, in truth and verity, a _Wineland_. Truly,\r\nthe results of to-day would certainly justify us in the assertion, that\r\nthere is as much, nay more, truth than fiction in it. Let us take a\r\nglance at the first commencement of grape culture, and see what has\r\nbeen the progress in this comparatively new branch of horticulture.\r\n\r\nFrom the very first settlement of America, the vine seems to have\r\nattracted the attention of the colonists, and it is said that as early\r\nas 1564, wine was made from the native grape in Florida. The earliest\r\nattempt to establish a vineyard in the British North American Colonies\r\nwas by the London Company in Virginia, about the year 1620; and by\r\n1630, the prospect seems to have been encouraging enough to warrant the\r\nimportation of several French vine-dressers, who, it is said, ruined\r\nthe vines by bad treatment. Wine was also made in Virginia in 1647, and\r\nin 1651 premiums were offered for its production. BEVERLY even\r\nmentions, that prior to 1722, there were vineyards in that colony,\r\nproducing seven hundred and fifty gallons per year. In 1664, Colonel\r\nRICHARD NICOLL, Governor of New York, granted to PAUL RICHARDS, a\r\nprivilege of making and selling wine free of all duty, he having been\r\nthe first to enter upon the cultivation of the vine on a large scale.\r\nBEAUCHAMP PLANTAGENET, in his description of the province of New\r\nAlbion, published in London, in 1648, states \"that the English settlers\r\nin Uvedale, now Delaware, had vines running on mulberry and sassafras\r\ntrees; and enumerates four kinds of grapes, namely: Thoulouse Muscat,\r\nSweet Scented, Great Fox, and Thick Grape; the first two, after five\r\nmonths, being boiled and salted and well fined, make a strong red\r\nXeres; the third, a light claret; the fourth, a white grape which\r\ncreeps on the land, makes a pure, gold colored wine. TENNIS PALE, a\r\nFrenchman, out of these four, made eight sorts of excellent wine; and\r\nsays of the Muscat, after it had been long boiled, that the second\r\ndraught will intoxicate after four months old; and that here may be\r\ngathered and made two hundred tuns in the vintage months, and that the\r\nvines with good cultivation will mend.\" In 1633, WILLIAM PENN attempted\r\nto establish a vineyard near Philadelphia, but without success. After\r\nsome years, however, Mr. TASKER, of Maryland, and Mr. ANTIL, of\r\nShrewsbury, N.J., seem to have succeeded to a certain extent. It seems,\r\nhowever, from an article which Mr. ANTIL wrote of the culture of the\r\ngrape, and the manufacture of wine, that he cultivated only foreign\r\nvarieties.\r\n\r\nIn 1796, the French settlers in Illinois made one hundred and ten\r\nhogsheads of strong wine from native grapes. At Harmony, near\r\nPittsburgh, a vineyard of ten acres was planted by FREDERIC RAPP, and\r\nhis associates from Germany; and they continued to cultivate grapes and\r\nsilk, after their removal to another Harmony in Indiana.\r\n\r\nIn 1790, a Swiss colony was founded, and a fund of ten thousand dollars\r\nraised in Jessamine county, Kentucky, for the purpose of establishing a\r\nvineyard, but failed, as they attempted to plant the foreign vine. In\r\n1801, they removed to a spot, which they called Vevay, in Switzerland\r\nCounty, Indiana, on the Ohio, forty-five miles below Cincinnati. Here\r\nthey planted native vines, especially the Cape, or Schuylkill Muscadel,\r\nand met with better success. But, after about forty years' experience,\r\nthey seem to have become discouraged, and their vineyards have now\r\nalmost disappeared.\r\n\r\nThese were the first crude experiments in American grape culture; and\r\nfrom some cause or another, they seem not to have been encouraging\r\nenough to warrant their continuation. But a new impetus was given to\r\nthis branch of industry, by the introduction of the Catawba, by Major\r\nADLUM, of Georgetown, D.C., who thought, that by so doing, he conferred\r\na greater benefit upon the nation than he would have done, had he paid\r\nthe national debt. It seems to have been planted first on an extensive\r\nscale by NICHOLAS LONGWORTH, near Cincinnati, whom we may justly call\r\none of the founders of American grape culture. He adopted the system of\r\nleasing parcels of unimproved land to poor Germans, to plant with\r\nvines; for a share, I believe, of one-half of the proceeds. It was his\r\nambition to make the Ohio the Rhine of America, and he has certainly\r\ndone a good deal to effect it. In 1858, the whole number of acres\r\nplanted in grapes around Cincinnati, was estimated, by a committee\r\nappointed for that purpose, at twelve hundred acres, of which Mr.\r\nLONGWORTH owned one hundred and twenty-two and a half acres, under\r\ncharge of twenty-seven tenants. The annual produce was estimated by the\r\ncommittee at no less than two hundred and forty thousand gallons, worth\r\nabout as many dollars then. We may safely estimate the number of acres\r\nin cultivation there now, at two thousand. Among the principal grape\r\ngrowers there, I will mention Messrs. ROBERT BUCHANAN, author of an\r\nexcellent work on grape culture, MOTTIER, BOGEN, WERK, REHFUSS, DR.\r\nMOSHER, etc.\r\n\r\nWell do I remember, when I was a boy, some fourteen years old, how\r\noften my father would enter into conversation with vintners from the\r\nold country, about the feasibility of grape culture in Missouri. He\r\nalways contended that grapes should succeed well here, as the woods\r\nwere full of wild grapes, some of very fair quality, and that this\r\nwould indicate a soil and climate favorable to the vine. They would\r\nridicule the idea, and assert that labor was too high here, even if the\r\nvines would succeed, to make it pay; but they could not shake his faith\r\nin the ultimate success of grape culture. Alas! he lived only long\r\nenough to see the first dawnings of that glorious future which he had\r\nso often anticipated, and none entered with more genuine zeal upon the\r\noccupation than he, when an untimely death took him from the labor he\r\nloved so well, and did not even allow him to taste the first fruits of\r\nthe vines he had planted and fostered. Had he been spared until now,\r\nhis most sanguine hopes would be verified.\r\n\r\nI also well remember the first cultivated grape vine which produced\r\nfruit in Hermann. It was an Isabella, planted by a Mr. FUGGER, on the\r\ncorner of Main and Schiller streets, and trained over an arbor. It\r\nproduced the first crop in 1845, twenty years ago, and so plentifully\r\ndid it bear, that several persons were encouraged by this apparent\r\nsuccess, to plant vines. In 1846, the first wine was made here, and\r\nagreeably surprised all who tried it, by its good quality. The Catawba\r\nhad during that time, been imported from Cincinnati, and the first\r\npartial crop from it, in 1848, was so plentiful, that every body,\r\nalmost, commenced planting vines, and often in very unfavorable\r\nlocalities. This, of course, had a bad influence on so capricious a\r\nvariety as the Catawba; rot and mildew appeared, and many became\r\ndiscouraged, because they did not realize what they had anticipated. A\r\nnumber of unfavorable seasons brought grape growing almost to a stand\r\nstill here. Some of our most enterprising grape growers still\r\npersevered, and succeeded by careful treatment, in making even the\r\nCatawba pay very handsome returns.\r\n\r\nIt was about this time, that the attention of some of our grape-growers\r\nwas drawn towards a small, insignificant looking grape, which had been\r\nobtained by a Mr. WIEDERSPRECKER from Mr. HEINRICHS, who had brought it\r\nfrom Cincinnati, and, almost at the same time, by Dr. KEHR, who had\r\nbrought it with him from Virginia. The vine seemed a rough customer,\r\nand its fruit very insignificant when compared with the large bunch and\r\nberry of the Catawba, but we soon observed that it kept its foliage\r\nbright and green when that of the Catawba became sickly and dropped;\r\nand also, that no rot or mildew damaged the fruit, when that of the\r\nCatawba was nearly destroyed by it. A few tried to propagate it by\r\ncuttings, but generally failed to make it grow. They then resorted to\r\ngrafting and layering, with much better success. After a few years a\r\nfew bottles of wine were made from it, and found to be very good. But\r\nat this time it almost received its death-blow, by a very unfavorable\r\nletter from Mr. LONGWORTH, who had been asked his opinion of it, and\r\npronounced it worthless. Of course, with the majority, the fiat of Mr.\r\nLONGWORTH, the father of American grape-culture, was conclusive\r\nevidence, and they abandoned it. Not all, however; a few persevered,\r\namong them Messrs. JACOB ROMMEL, POESCHEL, LANGENDOERFER, GREIN, and\r\nmyself. We thought Mr. LONGWORTH was human, and might be mistaken; and\r\ntrusted as much to the evidence of our senses as to his verdict,\r\ntherefore increased it as fast as we could, and the sequel proved that\r\nwe were right. After a few years more wine was made from it in larger\r\nquantities, found to be much better than the first imperfect samples;\r\nand now that despised and condemned grape is _the_ great variety for\r\nred wine, equal, if not superior to, the best Burgundy and Port; a wine\r\nof which good judges, heavy importers of the best European wines too,\r\nwill tell you that it has not its equal among all the foreign red\r\nwines; which has already saved the lives of thousands of suffering\r\nchildren, men, and women, and therefore one of the greatest blessings\r\nan all-merciful God has ever bestowed upon suffering humanity. This\r\ndespised grape is now the rage, and 500,000 of the plants could have\r\nbeen sold from this place alone the last fall, if they could have been\r\nobtained. Need I name it? it is the Norton's Virginia. Truly, \"great\r\noaks from little acorns grow!\" and I boldly prophecy to-day that the\r\ntime is not far distant when thousands upon thousands of our hillsides\r\nwill be covered with its luxuriant foliage, and its purple juice become\r\none of the exports to Europe; provided, always, that we do not grow so\r\nfond of it as to drink it all. I think that this is pre-eminently a\r\nMissouri grape. Here it seems to have found the soil in which it\r\nflourishes best. I have seen it in Ohio, but it does not look there as\r\nif it was the same grape. And why should it? They drove it from them\r\nand discarded it in its youth; we fostered it, and do you not think,\r\ndear reader, there sometimes is gratitude in plants as well as in men?\r\nOther States may plant it and succeed with it, too, to a certain\r\nextent, but it will cling with the truest devotion to those localities\r\nwhere it was cared for in its youth. Have we not also found, during the\r\nlate war, that the Germans, the adopted citizens of this great country,\r\nclung with a heartier devotion to our noble flag, and shed their blood\r\nmore freely for it, than thousands upon thousands of native-born\r\nAmericans? And why? Because here they found protection, equal rights\r\nfor all, and that freedom which had been the idol of their hearts, and\r\nhaunted their dreams by night; because they had been oppressed so long\r\nthey more fully appreciated the blessings of a free government than\r\nthose who had enjoyed it from their birth. But you may call me\r\nfantastical for comparing plants to human beings, and will say, plants\r\nhave no appreciation of such things. Brother Skeptic, have you, or has\r\nany body, divined _all_ the secrets of Nature's workshop? Truly we may\r\nsay that we have not, and we meet with facts every day which are\r\nstranger than fiction.\r\n\r\nThe Concord had as small a beginning with us. In the winter of 1855 a\r\nfew eyes of its wood were sent me by Mr. JAS. G. SOULARD, of Galena,\r\nIll. I grafted them upon old Catawba vines, and one of them grew. The\r\nnext year I distributed some of the scions to our vine-growers, who\r\ngrafted them also. When my vine commenced to bear I was astonished,\r\nafter what I had heard of the poor quality of the fruit from the East,\r\nto find it so fine, and so luxurious and healthy; and we propagated it\r\nas fast as possible. Now, scarcely nine years from the time when I\r\nreceived the first scions, hundreds of acres are being planted with it\r\nhere, and one-third of an acre of it, planted five years ago, has\r\nproduced for me, in fruit, wine, layers, cuttings, and plants, the\r\nround sum of ten thousand dollars during that time. Its wine, if\r\npressed as soon as the grapes are mashed, is eminently one of those\r\nwhich \"maketh glad the heart of man,\" and is evidently destined to\r\nbecome one of the common drinks of our laboring classes. It is light,\r\nagreeable to the palate, has a very enlivening and invigorating effect,\r\nand can be grown as cheap as good cider. I am satisfied that an acre\r\nwill, with good cultivation, produce from 1,000 to 1,500 gallons per\r\nyear. My vines produced this season at the rate of 2,500 gallons to the\r\nacre, but this may be called an extra-large crop. I have cited the\r\nhistory of these two varieties in our neighborhood merely as examples\r\nof progress. It would lead too far here, to follow the history of all\r\nour leading varieties, though many a goodly story might be told of\r\nthem. Our friends in the East claim as much for the Delaware and\r\nothers, with which we have not been able to succeed. And here let me\r\nsay that the sooner we divest ourselves of the idea that one grape\r\nshould be _the_ grape for this immense country of ours; the sooner we\r\ntry to adapt the variety to the locality--not the locality to the\r\nvariety--the sooner we will succeed. The idea is absurd, and unworthy\r\nof a thinking people, that one variety should succeed equally well or\r\nill in such a diversity of soil and climate as we have in this broad\r\nland of ours. It is in direct conflict with the laws of vegetable\r\nphysiology, as well as with common sense and experience. In planting\r\nour vineyards we should first go to one already established, which we\r\nthink has the same soil and location, or nearly so, as the one we are\r\ngoing to plant. Of those varieties which succeed there we should plant\r\nthe largest number, and plant a limited number also of all those\r\nvarieties which come recommended by good authority. A few seasons will\r\nshow which variety suits our soil, and what we ought to plant in\r\npreference to all others. Thus the Herbemont, the Cynthiana, Delaware,\r\nTaylor, Cunningham, Rulander, Martha, and even the Iona, may all find\r\ntheir proper location, where each will richly reward their cultivator;\r\nand certainly they are all too good not to be tried.\r\n\r\nNow, let us see what progress the country at large has made in\r\ngrape-growing during, say, the last ten years. _Then_, I think I may\r\nsafely assert, that the vineyards throughout the whole country did not\r\ncomprise more than three to four thousand acres. _Now_ I think I may\r\nsafely call them over two millions of acres. _Then_, our whole list\r\nembraced about ten varieties, all told, of which only the Catawba and\r\nIsabella were considered worthy of general cultivation; _now_ we count\r\nour native varieties by the hundreds, and the Catawba and Isabella will\r\nsoon number among the things which have been. Public taste has become\r\neducated, and they are laid aside in disgust, when such varieties as\r\nthe Herbemont, Delaware, Clara, Allen's Hybrid, Iona, Adirondac, and\r\nothers can be had. _Then_, grape-growing was confined to only a few\r\nsmall settlements; _now_ there is not a State in the Union, from Maine\r\nto California, but has its vineyards; and especially our Western States\r\nhave entered upon a race which shall excel the other in the good work.\r\nOur brethren in Illinois bid fair to outdo us, and vineyards spring up\r\nas if by magic, even on the prairies. Nay, grape-culture bids fair to\r\nextend into Minnesota, a country which was considered too cold for\r\nalmost anything except oats, pines, wolves, bears, and specimens of\r\ndaring humanity encased in triple wool. We begin to find out that we\r\nhave varieties which will stand almost anything if they are only\r\nsomewhat protected in winter. It was formerly believed that only\r\ncertain favored locations and soils in each State would produce good\r\ngrapes--for instance, sunny hillsides along large streams; now we begin\r\nto see that we can grow some varieties of grape on almost any soil. One\r\nof the most flourishing vineyards I have ever seen is on one of the\r\nislands in the Missouri river, where all the varieties planted\r\nthere--some six or seven--seemed perfectly at home in the rich, sandy\r\nmould, where it needs no trenching to loosen the soil. _Then_,\r\ngrape-growing, with the varieties then in cultivation, was a problem to\r\nbe solved; _now_, with the varieties we have proved, it is a certainty\r\nthat it is one of the most profitable branches of horticulture, paying\r\nthousands of dollars to the acre every year. _Then_, wine went begging\r\nat a dollar a gallon; _now_ it sells as fast as made at from two\r\ndollars to six dollars a gallon. Instead of the only wine then\r\nconsidered fit to drink, we number our wine-producing varieties by the\r\ndozen, all better than the Catawba; among the most prominent of which I\r\nwill name--of varieties producing white wine, the Herbemont, Delaware,\r\nCassidy, Taylor, Rulander, Cunningham, and Louisiana; of light-red\r\nwines, the Concord; of dark-red wines, the Norton's Virginia,\r\nCynthiana, Arkansas and Clinton; so that every palate can be suited.\r\nAnd California bids fair to outdo us all; for there, I am told, several\r\nkinds of wine are made from the same grape, in the same vineyard, and\r\nin fabulous quantities. To cite an example of the increase in planting:\r\nin 1854 the whole number of vines grown and sold in Hermann did not\r\nexceed two thousand. This season two millions of plants have been grown\r\nand sold, and not half enough to meet the demand. It is said that the\r\ntone of the press is a fair indication of public sentiment. If this is\r\ntrue what does it prove? Take one of our horticultural periodicals, and\r\nnine-tenths of the advertisements will be \"Grape-vines for sale,\" in\r\nany quantity and at any price, from five dollars to one hundred dollars\r\nper 100, raised North, East, South, and West. Turn to the reading\r\nmatter, and you can hardly turn over a leaf but the subject of grapes\r\nstares you in the face, with a quiet impunity, which plainly says, \"The\r\nnation is affected with grape fever; and while our readers have grape\r\non the brain there is no fear of overdosing.\" Why, the best proof I can\r\ngive my readers that grape fever does exist to an alarming degree, is\r\nthis very book itself. Were not I and they affected with the disease, I\r\nshould never have presumed to try their patience.\r\n\r\nBut, fortunately, the remedy is within easy reach. Plant grapes, every\r\none of you who is thus afflicted, until our hillsides are covered with\r\nthem, and we have made our barren spots blossom as the rose.\r\n\r\nTruly, the results we have already obtained, are cheering enough. And\r\nyet all this has been principally achieved in the last few years, while\r\nthe nation was involved in one of the most stupendous struggles the\r\nworld ever saw, while its very existence was endangered, and thousands\r\nupon thousands of her patriotic sons poured out their blood like water,\r\nand the husbandman left his home; the vintner his vineyard, to fight\r\nthe battles of his country. What then shall we become now, when peace\r\nhas smiled once more upon our beloved country; and the thousands of\r\nbrave arms, who brandished the sword, sabre, or musket, have come home\r\nonce more; and their weapons have been turned into ploughshares, and\r\ntheir swords into pruning hooks? When all the strong and willing hands\r\nwill clear our hillsides, and God's sun shines upon _one_ great and\r\nunited people; greater and more glorious than ever; because now they\r\nare _truly free_. Truly the future lies before us, rich in glorious\r\npromise; and ere long the words and the prophecy contained in the old\r\nlegend will become sober truth, and America will be, from the Atlantic\r\nto the Pacific _one_ smiling and happy _Wineland_; where each laborer\r\nshall sit under his own vine, and none will be too poor to enjoy the\r\npurest and most wholesome of all stimulants, good, cheap, native\r\n_wine_. Then drunkenness, now the curse of the nation, will disappear,\r\nand peace and good will towards all will rule our actions. And we,\r\nbrother grape growers? Ours is this great and glorious task; let us\r\nwork unceasingly, with hand, heart, and mind; truly the object is\r\nworthy of our best endeavors. Let those who begin to-day, remember how\r\neasy their task with the achievements and experiments of others before\r\nthem, compared with the labors of those who were the pioneers in the\r\ncultivation of the vine.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPROPAGATION OF THE VINE.\r\n\r\n\r\nI.--FROM SEED.\r\n\r\nThis would seem to be the most natural mode, were not the grape even\r\nmore liable to sport than almost any other fruit. It is, however, the\r\nonly method upon which we can depend for obtaining new and more\r\nvaluable varieties than we already possess, and to which we are already\r\nindebted for all the progress made in varieties, a progress which is,\r\nindeed, very encouraging; for who would deny that we are to-day\r\nimmeasurably in advance of what we were ten years ago. Among the\r\ninnumerable varieties which spring up every day, and which find ready\r\npurchasers, just because they _are new_, there are certainly some of\r\ndecided merit. But those who grow seedlings, should bear in mind, that\r\nthe list of our varieties is already too large; that it would be better\r\nif three-fourths of them were stricken off, and that no new variety\r\nshould be brought before the public, unless it has some decided\r\nsuperiority over any of the varieties we already have, in quality,\r\nproductiveness and exemption from disease. It is poor encouragement to\r\nthe grape growing public, to pay from two to five dollars a vine for a\r\nnew variety, with some high-sounding name, if, after several years of\r\nsuperior cultivation and faithful trial, they find their costly pet\r\ninferior to some variety they already possessed, and of which the\r\nplants could be obtained at a cost of from ten to fifty cents each.\r\n\r\nThe grapes from which the seed is to be used, should be fully ripe, and\r\nnone but well developed, large berries, should be taken. Keep these\r\nduring the winter, either in the pulp, or in cool, moist sand, so that\r\ntheir vitality may remain unimpaired. The soil upon which your seed-bed\r\nis made, should be light, deep and rich, and if it is not so naturally,\r\nshould be made so with well decomposed leaf-mould. As soon as the\r\nweather in spring will permit, dig up the soil to the depth of at least\r\neighteen inches, pulverising it well; then sow the seed in drills,\r\nabout a foot apart, and about one inch apart in the rows, covering them\r\nabout three-quarters of an inch deep. It will often be found necessary\r\nto shade the young plants when they come up, to prevent the sun from\r\nscalding them, but this should not be continued too long, as the plants\r\nwill become too tender, if protected too long. When the young plants\r\nhave grown about six inches, they may be supplied with small sticks, to\r\nwhich they will cling readily; the ground should be kept clean and\r\nmellow, and a light mulch should be applied, which will keep the soil\r\nloose and moist. The young plants should be closely watched, and if any\r\nof them show signs of disease, they should at once be pulled up; also\r\nthose which show a very feeble and delicate growth; for we should only\r\ntry to grow varieties with good, healthy constitutions. In the Fall,\r\nthe young plants should be either taken up, and carefully heeled in, or\r\nthey should be protected by earth, straw, or litter thrown over them.\r\nIn the Spring, they may be transplanted to their permanent locations;\r\nthe tops shortened in to six inches, and the roots shortened in to\r\nabout six inches from the stem. The soil for their reception should be\r\nmoderately light and rich, and loosened up to the depth of at least\r\neighteen inches.\r\n\r\nMake a hole about eight inches deep, then throw in soil so as to raise\r\na small mound in the centre of the hole, about two inches high; on this\r\nplace the young vine, and carefully spread the roots in all directions;\r\nthen fill up with well pulverized soil, so that the upper eye or bud is\r\neven with the surface of the ground; then press the soil down lightly;\r\nplace a good stake, of about four feet high, with the plant, and allow\r\nbut one shoot to grow, which should be neatly tied to the stake as it\r\ngrows. The vines may be planted in rows six feet apart, and three feet\r\napart in the rows, as many of them will prove worthless, and have to be\r\ntaken out. Allow all the laterals to grow on the young cane, as this\r\nwill make it short-jointed and stocky. Cultivate the ground well,\r\nstirring it freely with plough, cultivator, hoe, and rake, which\r\ngenerally is the best mulch that can be applied.\r\n\r\nWith the proper care and attention, our seedlings will generally grow\r\nfrom three to four feet, and make stout, short-jointed wood this second\r\nseason. Should any of them look particularly promising, fruit may be\r\nobtained a year sooner by taking the wood of it, and grafting strong\r\nold vines with it. These grafts will generally bear fruit the next\r\nseason. The method to be followed will be given in another place.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the second season the vines should be pruned to about\r\nthree eyes or buds, and the soil hilled up around them so as to cover\r\nthem up completely. The next spring take off the covering, and when the\r\nyoung shoots appear allow only two to grow. After they have grown about\r\neighteen inches, pinch off the top of the weakest, so as to throw the\r\ngrowth into the strongest shoot, which keep neatly tied to the stake,\r\ntreating it as the summer before, allowing all the laterals to grow.\r\nCultivate the soil well. At the end of this season's growth the vines\r\nshould be strong enough to bear the following summer. If they have made\r\nfrom eight to ten feet of stocky growth, the leading cane may be pruned\r\nto ten or twelve eyes, and the smaller one to a spur of two eyes. If\r\nthey will fruit at all, they will show it next summer, when only those\r\npromising well should be kept, and the barren and worthless ones\r\ndiscarded.\r\n\r\n\r\nII.--BY SINGLE EYES.\r\n\r\nAs this method is mostly followed only by those who propagate the vine\r\nfor sale in large quantities, and but to a limited extent by the\r\npractical vineyardist, I will give only an outline of the most simple\r\nmanner, and on the cheapest plan. Those wishing further information\r\nwill do well to consult \"The Grape Culturist,\" by Mr. A. S. FULLER, in\r\nwhich excellent work they will find full instructions.\r\n\r\nThe principal advantages of this mode of propagation are the following:\r\n1st. The facility with which new and rare kinds can be multiplied, as\r\nevery well ripened bud almost can be transformed into a plant. 2d. As\r\nthe plants are started under glass, by bottom heat, it lengthens the\r\nseason of their growth from one to two months. 3d. Every variety of\r\ngrape can be propagated by this method with the greatest ease, even\r\nthose which only grow with the greatest difficulty, or not at all, from\r\ncuttings in open ground.\r\n\r\nAs to the merits or demerits of plants grown under glass from single\r\neyes, to those grown from cuttings or layers in open ground, opinions\r\ndiffer very much, and both have their advocates. For my part, I do not\r\nsee why a plant grown carefully from a single eye should not be as good\r\nas one propagated by any other method; a poor plant is not worth\r\nhaving, whether propagated by this or any other method, and,\r\nunfortunately, we have too many of them.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PROPAGATING HOUSE.\r\n\r\nI will only give a description of a lean-to of the cheapest kind, for\r\nwhich any common hot-bed sash, six feet long, can be used.\r\n\r\nChoose for a location the south side of a hill, as, by making the house\r\nalmost entirely underground, a great deal of building material can be\r\nsaved. Excavate the ground as for a cellar--say five feet deep on the\r\nupper side, seven feet wide, and of any length to suit convenience, and\r\nthe number of plants you wish to grow. Inside of the excavation set\r\nposts or scantlings, the upper row to be seven feet long above the\r\nground, and two feet below the ground; the lower row four and one-half\r\nfeet above the ground, so that the roof will have about two and\r\none-half feet pitch. Upon these nail the rafters, of two-inch planks.\r\nThen take boards, say common inch-plank, and set them up behind the\r\nposts, one above the other, to prevent the earth from falling in. This\r\nwill make all the wall that is needed on both sides. On the ends,\r\nboards can be nailed to both sides of the posts, and the intervening\r\nspace tilled with spent tan or saw-dust. Upon the rafters place the\r\nsash on the lower side; the upper side may be covered with boards or\r\nshingles, where also the ventilating holes can be left, to be closed\r\nwith trap-doors. The house is to be divided into two compartments--the\r\nfurnace-room on one end, about eight feet long, and the propagating\r\nhouse, The furnace is below the ground, say four feet long, the flue to\r\nbe made of brick, and to extend under the whole length of the bench. To\r\nmake the flue, lay a row of bricks flat and crosswise; on the ends of\r\nthese place two others on their edges, and across the top lay a row\r\nflat, in the same way as the bottom ones were placed. This gives the\r\nflue four inches by eight in the clear. The flue should rise rather\r\nabruptly from the furnace, say about a foot; it can then be carried\r\nfifty feet with, say six to nine inches rise, and still have sufficient\r\ndraft. Inside of the propagating room we have again two\r\ncompartments--the propagating bench, nearest to the furnace, and a\r\nshelf for the reception of the young plants, after their first\r\ntransplanting from the cutting-pots or boxes. Make a shelf or table\r\nalong the whole length of the house; at the lower end it should be\r\nabout eighteen inches from the glass, and five feet wide. To a house\r\nof, say fifty feet, the propagating bench may be, say twelve feet long,\r\nand the room below it and around the flue should be inclosed with\r\nboards, as it will keep the heat better.\r\n\r\n\r\nMODE OF OPERATING.\r\n\r\nThe wood should be cut from the vines in the fall, as soon as the\r\nleaves have dropped. For propagating, use only firm, well-ripened wood\r\nof the last season's growth, and about medium thickness. These are to\r\nbe preferred to either very large or very small ones. The time to\r\ncommence operating will vary according to climate; here it should be\r\nthe early part of February. The wood to be used for propagating can be\r\nkept in a cool cellar, in sand, or buried in the ground out doors. Take\r\nout the cuttings, and cut them up into pieces as represented in Figure\r\n1.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1.]\r\n\r\nThrow these into water as they are cut; it will prevent them from\r\nbecoming dry. It will be found of benefit with hard-wooded varieties to\r\npack them in damp moss for a week or so before they are put into the\r\npropagating pots or boxes; it will soften the alburnous matter, and\r\nmake them strike root more readily. They should then be put into, say\r\nsix-inch pots, filled to about an inch of the top with pure coarse\r\nsand, firmly packed. Place the cuttings, the buds up, about an inch\r\napart, all over the surface of the pot; press down firmly with thumb\r\nand forefinger until the bud is even with the surface; sift on sand\r\nenough to cover the upper point of the bud about a quarter of an inch\r\ndeep; press down evenly, using the bottom of another pot for the\r\npurpose, and apply water enough to moisten the whole contents of the\r\npot. Instead of the pots, shallow boxes of about six inches deep, can\r\nalso be used, with a few holes bored in the bottom for drainage.\r\n\r\nAfter the pots have been filled with cuttings they are placed in a\r\ntemperature of from 40° to 45°, where they remain from two to three\r\nweeks, water being applied only enough to keep them moist, not wet. As\r\nroots are formed at a much lower degree of temperature than leaves,\r\nthey should not be forced too much at the beginning, or the leaves will\r\nappear before we have any roots to support them. But when the cutting\r\nhas formed its roots first, the foliage, when it does appear, will grow\r\nmuch more rapidly, and without any check. Then remove them to another\r\nposition, plunging the pots into sand to the depth of, say three\r\ninches, and raise the temperature at first to 60° for the first few\r\ndays, then gradually raise it to 80°. When the buds begin to push,\r\nraise the temperature to 90° or 95°, and keep the air moist by frequent\r\nwaterings, say once a day. The best for this purpose is pure\r\nrain-water, but it should be of nearly the same temperature as the air\r\nin the house, for, if applied cold, it would surely check the growth of\r\nthe plants. The young growth should be examined every day, to see if\r\nthere is any sign of rotting; should this be the case, give a little\r\nmore air, but admit no sudden cold currents, as they are often fatal.\r\nThe glass should be whitewashed, to avoid the direct rays of the sun.\r\n\r\nWhen the young vines have made a growth of two or three inches shift\r\nthem into three-inch pots.\r\n\r\nSo far we have used only pure sand, which did not contain much plant\r\nfood, because the growth was produced from the food stored up in the\r\nbud and wood, and what little they obtained from the sand, water, and\r\nair. Now, however, our young vines want more substantial food. They\r\nshould therefore be potted into soil, mixed from rotten sod,\r\nleaf-mould, and well-decomposed old barnyard manure. This should be\r\nmixed together six months before using; add, before using, one-quarter\r\nsand, then mix thoroughly, and sift all through a coarse sieve. In\r\noperating, put a quantity of soil on the potting bench, provide a\r\nquantity of broken bricks or potsherds for drainage, loosen the plants\r\nfrom the pots by laying them on their side, giving them a sudden jar\r\nwith the hand, to loosen the sand around them; draw out the plant\r\ncarefully, holding it with one hand, while with the other you place a\r\npiece of the drainage material into the pot; cover it with soil about\r\nan inch; then put in the plant, holding it so that the roots spread out\r\nnaturally; fill in soil around them until the pot is full; press the\r\nsoil down firmly, but not hard enough to break the roots. When the\r\nplants are potted give them water to settle the earth around the roots,\r\nand keep the air somewhat confined for a few days, until they have\r\nbecome established, when more air may be given them. Keep the\r\ntemperature at 85° to 95° during the day, and 70° to 80° during the\r\nnight.\r\n\r\nWhen the plants have made about six inches of growth they can either be\r\nplaced in another house, or in hot-bed frames, if they are to be kept\r\nunder glass. The usual manner of keeping them in pots during summer,\r\nshifting them into larger and larger sizes, I consider injurious to the\r\nfree development of the plants, as the roots are distorted and cramped\r\nagainst the sides of the pots, and cannot spread naturally. I prefer\r\nshifting them into cold frames, in which beds have been prepared of\r\nlight, rich soil, into which the young plants can be planted, and kept\r\nunder whitewashed hot-bed sashes for a while, which, after several\r\nweeks, may be removed, and only a light shading substituted in their\r\nplace, which, after several weeks more, can also be removed. Thus the\r\nyoung plants are gradually hardened, their roots have a chance to\r\nspread evenly and naturally, without any cramping; and such plants,\r\nalthough they may not make as tall a growth as those kept under glass\r\nall the season, will really stand transplanting into the vineyard much\r\nbetter than those hot-house pets, which may look well enough, but\r\nreally are, like spoiled and pampered children, but poorly fitted to\r\nstand the rough vicissitudes of every-day life.\r\n\r\nThe young plants should be lightly tied to small sticks provided for\r\nthe purpose, as it will allow free circulation of air, and admit the\r\nsun more freely to the roots. In the fall, after their leaves have\r\ndropped, they should be carefully taken up, shortened to about a foot\r\nof their growth, and they are then ready either to sell, if they are to\r\nbe disposed of in that way, or for planting into the vineyard. They\r\nshould, however, be carefully assorted, making three classes of\r\nthem--the strongest, medium, and the smallest--each to be put separate.\r\nThe latter generally are not fit to transplant into the vineyard, but\r\nthey may be heeled in, and grown in beds another year, when they will\r\noften make very good plants. Heeling in may be done as shown in Figure\r\n2, laying the vines as close in the rows as they can conveniently be\r\nlaid, and then fill the trench with well-pulverized soil. They can thus\r\nbe safely kept during the winter.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 2.]\r\n\r\nI have only given an outline of the most simple and cheapest mode of\r\ngrowing plants from single eyes, such as even the vineyardist may\r\nfollow. For descriptions of more extensive and costly buildings, if\r\nthey desire them, they had better apply to an architect. I have also\r\nnot given the mode of propagating from green wood, as I do not think,\r\nplants thus propagated are desirable. They are apt to be feeble and\r\ndiseased, and I think, the country at large would be much better off,\r\nhad not a single plant ever been produced by that method.\r\n\r\nPlants from single eyes may also be grown in a common hot-bed; but as\r\nin this the heat can not be as well regulated at will, I think it, upon\r\nthe whole, not desirable, as the expense of a propagating house on the\r\ncheap plan I have indicated, is but very little more, and will\r\ncertainly in the long run, pay much better. Of course, close attention\r\nand careful watching is the first requisite in all the operations.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.--BY CUTTINGS IN OPEN AIR.\r\n\r\nThis is certainly the easiest and most simple method for the\r\nvineyardist; can be followed successfully with the majority of\r\nvarieties, which have moderately soft wood, and even a part of the hard\r\nwood varieties will generally grow, if managed carefully.\r\n\r\n\r\nMODE OF OPERATING.\r\n\r\nThere are several methods, which are followed with more or less\r\nsuccess. I will first describe that which I have found most successful,\r\nnamely, short cuttings, of two or three eyes each, which are made of\r\nany sound, well ripened wood, of last season's growth. Prune the vines\r\nin the fall or early winter, and make the cuttings as soon as\r\nconvenient; for if the wood is not kept perfectly fresh and green, the\r\ncuttings will fail to grow. Now, cut up all the sound, well-ripened\r\nwood into lengths of from two to four eyes each, making them of a\r\nuniform length of say eight inches, and prepare them as shown in Figure\r\n3.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 3.]\r\n\r\nThese should be tied into convenient bundles, from 100 to 250 in each,\r\ntaking care to even the lower ends, and then buried in the ground,\r\nmaking a hole somewhat deeper than the cuttings are long, into which\r\nthe bundles are set on their lower ends, and soil thrown in between and\r\nover them. In spring, as soon as the ground is dry enough, the\r\ncutting-bed should be prepared. Choose for this a light, rich soil,\r\nwhich should be well pulverized, to the depth of at least a foot, and\r\nif not light enough, it should be made so by adding some leaf mould.\r\nNow draw a line along the whole length of the bed; then take a spade\r\nand put it down perpendicular along the line or nearly so, moving it a\r\nlittle backwards and forwards, so as to open the cut. Now take the\r\ncutting and press it down into the cut thus made, until the upper bud\r\nis even with the surface of the soil. The cuttings may be put close in\r\nthe rows, say an inch apart, and the rows made two feet apart. Press\r\nthe ground firmly down with your foot along the line of cuttings, so as\r\nto pack it closely around the cutting. After the bed is finished, mulch\r\nthem with straw, or litter, spent tan or saw-dust, say about an inch\r\nthick, and if none of these can be had, leaves from the forest may be\r\nused for the purpose. This will serve to protect the young leaves from\r\nthe sun, and will also keep an even moisture during the heat of summer,\r\nat the same time keeping the soil loose and porous. If weeds appear,\r\nthey should be pulled up, and the cuttings, kept clean through the\r\nsummer. They will generally make a firm, hardy growth of from one to\r\nfour feet, have become used to all the hardships and changes of the\r\nweather; and as they have formed their roots just where they ought to\r\nbe, about eight inches below the ground, will not suffer so much from\r\ntransplanting, as either a single eye or a layer, whose roots have to\r\nbe put much deeper in transplanting, than they were before, and thus,\r\nas it were, become acclimated to the lower regions. For these reasons,\r\nI think, that a good plant grown from a cutting is preferable to that\r\npropagated by any other method. In the Fall, the vines are carefully\r\ntaken up, assorted and heeled in, in the same manner as described, with\r\nsingle eyes, and cut back to about three inches of their growth. They\r\nare then ready for transplanting into the vineyard.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV.--BY LAYERING.\r\n\r\nThis is a very convenient method of increasing such varieties as will\r\nnot grow readily from cuttings; and vines thus propagated will, if\r\ntreated right, make very good plants. To layer a vine, shorten in its\r\nlast season's growth to about one-half; then prepare the ground\r\nthoroughly, pulverizing it well; then, early in spring make a small\r\nfurrow, about an inch deep, then bend the cane down and fasten it\r\nfirmly in the bottom of the trench, by wooden hooks or pegs, made for\r\nthe purpose. They may thus be left, until the young shoots have grown,\r\nsay six inches; then fill up with finely pulverized soil or leaf-mould.\r\nThe vines will thus strike root generally at every joint. The young\r\nshoots may be tied to small sticks, provided for the purpose, and when\r\nthey have grown about a foot, their tips should be pinched off to make\r\nthem grow more stocky. In the Fall they are taken up carefully,\r\ncommencing to dig at the end furthest removed from the vine, and\r\nseparate each plant between the joints, so that every shoot has a\r\nsystem of roots by itself. They are then either planted immediately, or\r\nheeled in as described before.\r\n\r\n\r\nV.--BY GRAFTING.\r\n\r\nThe principal advantages to be gained by this method are: 1st. The\r\nfacility by which new and rare kinds may be increased, by grafting them\r\non strong stocks of healthy varieties, when they will often grow from\r\nten to twenty feet the first season, producing an abundance of wood to\r\npropagate. 2d. The short time in which fruit can be obtained from new\r\nand untried varieties, as their grafts will generally bear the next\r\nseason. 3d. In every vineyard there are, in these days of many\r\nvarieties, vines which have proved inferior, yet by grafting into them\r\nsome superior variety, they may be made very valuable. 4th. The\r\nfacility by which vines can be forced under glass, by grafting on small\r\npieces of roots, and the certainty with which every bud can thus be\r\nmade to grow.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 4.]\r\n\r\nThe vine, however, does not unite with the same facility as the pear\r\nand apple, and, to ensure success, must be grafted under ground, which\r\nmakes the operation a difficult and disagreeable one. It will therefore\r\nhardly become a general practice; but, for the purposes above named, is\r\nof sufficient importance, to make it desirable that every vineyardist\r\nshould be able to perform it. I have generally had the best success in\r\ngrafting here about the middle of March, in the following manner: Dig\r\naway the ground around the vine you wish to graft, until you come to a\r\nsmooth place to insert your scion; then cut off the vine with a sharp\r\nknife, and insert one or two scions, as in common cleft-grafting,\r\ntaking care to cut the wedge on the scion very thin, with shoulders on\r\nboth sides, as shown in Figure 4, cutting your scion to two eyes, to\r\nbetter insure success. Great care must be taken to insert the scion\r\nproperly, as the inner bark or liber of the vine is very thin, and the\r\nsuccess of the operation depends upon a perfect junction of the stock\r\nand scion. If the vine is strong enough to hold the scion firmly, no\r\nfurther bandage is necessary; if not, it should be wound firmly and\r\nevenly with bass bark. Then press the soil firmly on the cut, and fill\r\nup the hole with well pulverized earth, to the top of the scion.\r\nExamine the stock from time to time, and remove all wild shoots and\r\nsuckers, which it may throw up, as they will rob the graft of\r\nnourishment and enfeeble it.\r\n\r\nOthers prefer to graft in May, when the leaves have expanded, and the\r\nmost rapid flow of sap has ceased, keeping the scions in a cool place,\r\nto prevent the buds from starting. The operation is performed in\r\nprecisely the same manner, and will be just as successful, I think, but\r\nthe grafts that have been put in early, have the advantage of several\r\nweeks over the others, and the latter will seldom make as strong a\r\ngrowth, or ripen their wood as well as those put in early.\r\n\r\nMr. A. S. FULLER performs the operation in the fall, preventing the\r\ngraft from freezing by inverting a flower-pot over it, and then\r\ncovering with straw or litter. He claims for this method--1st. That it\r\ncan be performed at a time when the ground is more dry, and in better\r\ncondition, and business not so pressing as in spring.--2d. That the\r\nscion and stock have more time to unite, and will form their junction\r\ncompletely during the winter, and will therefore start sooner, and make\r\na more rapid growth than in spring. It certainly looks feasible enough,\r\nand is well worth trying, as, when the operation succeeds, it must\r\nevidently have advantages over any of the other modes.\r\n\r\nVines I had grafted in March have sometimes made twenty to thirty feet\r\nof growth, and produced a full crop the next season. This will show one\r\nthe advantage to be derived from it in propagating new and scarce\r\nvarieties, and in hastening the fruiting of them. Should a seedling,\r\nfor instance, look very promising in foliage and general appearance,\r\nfruit may be obtained from it from one to two seasons sooner by\r\ngrafting some of the wood on strong stocks, than from the original\r\nplant. Hence the vast importance of grafting, even to the practical\r\nvineyardist.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE VINEYARD.\r\n\r\n\r\nLOCATION AND SOIL.\r\n\r\nAs the selection of a proper location is of vast importance, and one of\r\nthe main conditions of success, great care and judgment should be\r\nexercised in the choice. Some varieties of grapes may be grown on\r\nalmost any soil, it is true; but even they will show a vast difference\r\nin the quality of the fruit, even if the quantity were satisfactory; on\r\nindifferent soil, and in an inferior location. Everybody should grow\r\ngrapes enough for his own use, who owns an acre of ground, but every\r\none cannot grow them and make the most delicious wine.\r\n\r\nThe best locations are generally on the hillsides, along our larger\r\nrivers, water-courses, and lakes, sloping to the East, South, and\r\nSouthwest, as they are generally more exempt from late spring frosts\r\nand early frosts in fall. The location should be sheltered from the\r\ncold winds from the north and northwest, but fully exposed to the\r\nprevailing winds in summer from the south and southwest. If a hill is\r\nchosen at any distance from a large body of water, it should be high\r\nand airy, with as gentle a slope as can be obtained. The locations\r\nalong creeks and smaller water-courses should be particularly avoided,\r\nas they are subject to late spring frosts, and are generally damp and\r\nmoist.\r\n\r\nThe soil should be a dry, calcareous loam, sufficiently deep, say three\r\nfeet; if possible, draining itself readily. Should this not be the case\r\nnaturally, it should be done with tiles.\r\n\r\nI was much struck by the force of a remark made by medical friend last\r\nsummer, when, in consequence of the continual rains, the ague was very\r\nprevalent. It was this: wherever you will find the ague an habitual\r\nguest with the inhabitants you need not look for healthy grapevines.\r\nWherever we find stagnant water let us avoid the neighboring hillsides,\r\nfor they would not be congenial to our grape-vines. But on the bluffs\r\noverhanging the banks of our large streams, especially on the northern\r\nand western sides, where the vines are sheltered from the north and\r\nwest winds, and fully exposed to the warm southern winds of our summer\r\ndays, and where the fogs arising from the water yet give sufficient\r\nhumidity to the atmosphere, even in the hottest summer days, to refresh\r\nthe leaf during the night and morning hours; where the soil on the\r\nsouthern and eastern slopes is a mixture of decomposed stone and\r\nleaf-mould, and feels like velvet to the feet--there is the paradise\r\nfor the grape; and the soil is already better prepared for it than the\r\nhand of man can ever do. Such locations should be cheap to the\r\ngrape-grower at _any_ price. We find them very frequently along the\r\nnorthern banks of the Missouri and Mississippi rivers, and they will no\r\ndoubt become the favored grape regions of the country. The grape grows\r\nthere with a luxuriance and health which is almost incredible to those\r\nliving in less favored locations.\r\n\r\nBut the question may be asked here, what shall be done by those who do\r\nnot live in these favored regions, and yet would like to grow grapes? I\r\nanswer, let them choose the best location they have, the most free and\r\nairy, and let them choose only those sturdy varieties that withstand\r\neverything. They cannot grow the most delicate varieties--the\r\nHerbemont, the Delaware, the Clara, are not for them; but they can grow\r\nthe Concord, Hartford Prolific, and Norton's Virginia, and they at\r\nleast are \"very good,\" although they may not be the \"best.\" There is no\r\nexcuse for any one in this country why he should not grow his own\r\ngrapes, for the use of his family at least, if he has any ground to\r\ngrow them on.\r\n\r\n\r\nPREPARING THE SOIL.\r\n\r\nIn this, the foundation of all grape-growing, the vineyardist must also\r\nlook to the condition in which he finds the soil. Should it be free of\r\nstones, stumps, and other obstructions, the plough and sub-soil plough\r\nwill be all-sufficient.\r\n\r\nShould your soil be new, perhaps a piece of wild forest land, have it\r\ncarefully grubbed, and every tree and stump taken out by the roots.\r\nAfter the ground is cleared take a large breaking-plough, with three\r\nyoke of sturdy oxen, and plough as deep as you can, say twelve to\r\nfourteen inches. Now follow in the same furrow with an implement we\r\ncall here a sub-soil stirrer, and which is simply a plough-share of\r\nwedge shape, running in the bottom of the furrow, and a strong coulter,\r\nrunning up from it through the beam of the plough, sharp in front, to\r\ncut the roots; the depth of the furrow is regulated by a movable wheel\r\nrunning in front, which can be set by a screw. With two yoke of oxen\r\nthis will loosen the soil to the depth of, say twenty inches, which is\r\nsufficient, unless the sub-soil is very tenacious. In land already\r\ncultivated, where there are no roots to obstruct, two yoke of oxen or\r\nfour horses attached to the plough, and one yoke of oxen or a pair of\r\nhorses or mules to the sub-soil plough, will be sufficient. In stony\r\nsoil the pick and shovel must take the place of the plough, as it would\r\nbe impossible to work it thoroughly with the latter; but I think there\r\nis no advantage in the common method of trenching or inverting the\r\nsoil, as is now practiced to a very great extent. If we examine the\r\ngrowth of our native vines we will generally find their roots extending\r\nalong the surface of the soil. It is unnatural to suppose that the\r\ngrape, the most sun-loving of all our plants, should be buried with its\r\nroots several feet below the surface of the soil, far beyond the reach\r\nof sun and air. Therefore, if you can afford it, work your soil deep\r\nand thoroughly; it will be labor well invested; is the best preventive\r\nagainst drouth, and also the best drainage in wet weather; but have it\r\nin its natural position--not invert it; and do not plant too deep.\r\nShould the soil be very poor it may be enriched by manure, ashes,\r\nbone-dust, etc.; but it will seldom be found necessary, as most of our\r\nsoil is rich enough; and it is not advisable to stimulate the growth\r\ntoo much, as it will be rank and unhealthy, and injurious to the\r\nquality and flavor of the fruit.\r\n\r\nWet spots may be drained by gutters filled with loose stones, or tiles,\r\nand then covered with earth. Surface-draining can be done by running a\r\nsmall ditch or furrow every sixth or eighth row, parallel with the\r\nhillside, and leading into a main ditch at the end or the middle of the\r\nvineyard. Steep hillsides should be terraced or benched; but, as this\r\nis very expensive, they should be avoided.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWHAT SHALL WE PLANT?\r\n\r\n\r\nCHOICE OF VARIETIES.\r\n\r\nIt is a very difficult matter, in a vast country like ours, where the\r\nsoil and climate differ so much, to recommend any thing; and I think it\r\na mistake, into which many of our prominent grape-growers have fallen,\r\nto recommend _any_ variety, simply because it succeeded well _with\r\nthem_, for _general_ cultivation. Grape-growing is, perhaps, more than\r\nany other branch of horticulture or pomology, dependent upon soil,\r\nlocation and climate, and it will not do to dictate to the inhabitants\r\nof a country, in which the \"extremes meet,\" that they should _all_\r\nplant one variety. Yet this has been done by some who _pretend_ to be\r\nauthorities, and it shows, more than any thing else, that they have\r\nmore arrogance than knowledge. I, for my part, have seen such widely\r\ndifferent results, from the same varieties, under the same treatment,\r\nand in vineyards only a few miles apart, but with a different soil and\r\ndifferent aspect, that I am reluctant to recommend to my next neighbor,\r\nwhat he shall plant.\r\n\r\nBut, while the task is a difficult one, yet we may lay down certain\r\nrules, which can govern us in selection of varieties to a certain\r\nextent. We should choose--1st. The variety which has given the most\r\ngeneral satisfaction in the State or county in which we live, or the\r\nnearest locality to us. 2d--Visit the nearest accessible vineyard in\r\nthe month of August and September, observe closely which variety has\r\nthe healthiest foliage and fruit; ripens the most uniformly and\r\nperfectly; and either sells best in market, or makes the best wine, and\r\nwhich, at the same time, is of good quality, and productive enough.\r\nYour observations, thus taken, will be a better guide than the opinion\r\nof the most skillful grape grower a thousand miles off.\r\n\r\nI will now name a few of the most prominent varieties which should at\r\nleast be tried by every grape grower.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CONCORD.\r\n\r\nThis grape seems to have given the most general satisfaction all over\r\nthe country, and seems to be _the_ \"grape for the million.\" Wherever\r\nheard from, it seems to be uniformly healthy and productive. Our\r\nEastern friends complain of its inferior quality; this may be owing\r\npartly to their short seasons, and partly to the too early gathering of\r\nthe fruit. It is one of those varieties which color early, but should\r\nhang a long time after coloring, to attain its full perfection. Here it\r\nis at least _very_ good; makes an excellent wine, and, if we take into\r\nconsideration its enormous productiveness, its vigor and adaptability\r\nto all soils and climates, we must acknowledge that as yet it stands\r\nwithout a rival, and will be a safe investment almost anywhere. Our\r\nlong summers bring it to a perfection of which our Eastern friends have\r\nno idea, until they try it here. It will do well in almost any soil.\r\n\r\n\r\nNORTON'S VIRGINIA.\r\n\r\nThis, so far, is the leading grape for red wine, and its reputation\r\nhere and in the entire West is now so fully established, that it would\r\nbe difficult indeed to persuade our people into the belief, that any\r\nother grape could make a better red wine. It is healthy and uniformly\r\nproductive, and will be safe to plant, I think, in nearly all the\r\nWestern States. I rather doubt that our Eastern friends will succeed in\r\nmaking a first class wine from it, as I think their summers are too\r\nshort, to develop all its good qualities. Will succeed in almost any\r\nsoil, but attains its greatest perfection in southern slopes with\r\nsomewhat strong soil.\r\n\r\n\r\nHERBEMONT.\r\n\r\nThis is a truly delicious grape, but somewhat tender, and wants a long\r\nseason to fully ripen its fruit and bring out all its good qualities.\r\nWill hardly do much further north than we are here, in Missouri, but\r\nis, I think, destined to be one of the leading grapes for the Southern\r\nStates. If you have a warm, southern exposure, somewhat stony, with\r\nlimestone foundation, plant the Herbemont, and you will not be\r\ndisappointed. It is healthy and very productive; more refreshing than\r\nthe Delaware, and makes an excellent wine.\r\n\r\n\r\nDELAWARE.\r\n\r\nIs much recommended by Eastern authorities, and where it succeeds, is\r\ncertainly a fine grape and makes a delicious wine. Here at the West, it\r\nhas proved a failure in most locations, being subject to leaf-blight,\r\nand a feeble grower. There are some locations, however, where it will\r\nflourish; and whoever is the fortunate possessor of such a one should\r\nnot forget to plant it. It seems to flourish best in light, warm,\r\nsomewhat sandy soil.\r\n\r\n\r\nHARTFORD PROLIFIC.\r\n\r\nThis is immensely productive; of very fair quality here; hardy and\r\nhealthy; and if planted for early marketing, will give general\r\nsatisfaction. It hangs well to the bunch, and even makes a very fair\r\nwine. Will flourish in almost every soil.\r\n\r\n\r\nCLINTON.\r\n\r\nHardy, healthy and productive; will make a fair wine, but is here not\r\nequal even to the Concord, and far behind the Norton's Virginia in\r\nquality. May be desirable further north.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPLANTING.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe distance at which the vines may be planted will of course vary\r\nsomewhat with the growth of the different varieties. The rows may all\r\nbe six feet apart, as this is the most convenient distance for\r\ncultivating, and gives ample space for a horse and man to pass through\r\nwith plough or cultivator. Slow-growing varieties, such as the Delaware\r\nand Catawba, may be planted six feet apart in the rows, making the\r\ndistance six feet each way; but the Concord, Norton's Virginia,\r\nHerbemont, Hartford Prolific, Cunningham, and all the strong growers,\r\nwill need more room, say ten feet in the rows, so as to give the vines\r\nample room to spread, and allow free circulation of air--one of the\r\nfirst conditions of health in the vines, and quality of the fruit.\r\n\r\nThe next question to be considered is: Shall we plant cuttings or\r\nrooted plants? My preference is decidedly for the latter, for the\r\nfollowing reasons: Cuttings are uncertain, even of those varieties\r\nwhich grow the most readily; and we cannot expect to have anything like\r\nan even growth, such as we can have if the plants are carefully\r\nassorted. Some of the cuttings will always fail, and there will be gaps\r\nand vacancies which are hard to fill, even if the strongest plants are\r\ntaken for replanting. Therefore, let us choose plants.\r\n\r\nBut we should not only choose rooted plants, but the best we can get;\r\nand these are good one year old, whether grown from cuttings, layers or\r\nsingle eyes. A good plant should have plenty of strong, well-ripened\r\nroots; not covered with excrescences and warts, which is always a sign\r\nof ill health; but smooth and firm; with well-ripened, short-jointed\r\nwood. They should be of uniform size, as they will then make an even\r\nstand in the vineyard, when not forced by the propagator into an\r\nunnaturally rank growth by artificial manures. This latter\r\nconsideration, I think, is very important, as we can hardly expect such\r\nplants, which have been petted and pampered, and fed on rich diet, to\r\nthrive on the every-day fare they will find in the vineyard. Do not\r\ntake second or third rate plants, if you can help it; they may live and\r\ngrow, but they will never make the growth which a plant of better\r\nquality would make. We may hear of good results sometimes, obtained by\r\nplanting second-rate plants, but certainly the results would be better\r\nif better plants had been chosen. Especially important is the selection\r\nof good plants with those varieties which do not propagate and\r\ntransplant readily, such as the Norton's Virginia, Delaware, and other\r\nhard-wood varieties. Better pay double the price you would have to give\r\nfor inferior plants; the best are the cheapest in the end, as they will\r\nmake the healthiest vines, and bear sooner.\r\n\r\nBut I would also caution my readers against those who will sell you\r\n\"extra large layers, for _immediate_ bearing,\" and whose \"plants are\r\nbetter than those whom anybody else may grow,\" as their advertisements\r\nwill term it. It is time that this humbug should cease; time that the\r\npublic in general should know, that they cannot, in nature and reason,\r\nexpect any fruit from a plant transplanted the same season; and that\r\nthose who pretend it can be done, without vital injury to the plant,\r\nare only seeking to fill their pockets at the cost of their customers.\r\nThey know well enough themselves that it cannot be done without killing\r\nor fatally injuring the plant, yet they will impose upon the credulity\r\nof their confiding customers; make them pay from $3 to $5 a piece for a\r\nplant, which these good souls will buy, with a vision of a fine crop of\r\ngrapes before their eyes, plant them, with long tops, on which they may\r\nobtain a few sickly bunches of fruit the first season; but if they do\r\nthe vines will make a feeble growth, not ripen their fruit, and perhaps\r\nbe winter-killed the next season. It is like laying the burden of a\r\nfull grown man on the shoulders of a child; what was perhaps no burden\r\nat all to the one, will kill the other. Then, again, these \"plants,\r\nsuperior to those of every one else.\" It is the duty of every\r\npropagator and nursery-man to raise good plants; he can do it if he\r\ntries; it is for his interest as much as for the interest of his\r\ncustomers to raise plants of the best quality; and we have no reason to\r\nsuppose that we are infinitely superior to our neighbors. While the\r\nfirst is a downright swindle, the latter is the height of arrogance. If\r\nwe had a good deal less of bombast and self laudation, and more of\r\nhonesty and fair dealing in the profession, the public would have more\r\nconfidence in professional men, and would be more likely to practice\r\nwhat we preach. Therefore, if you look around for plants, do not go to\r\nthose who advertise, \"layers for immediate bearing,\" or \"plants of\r\nsuperior quality to all others grown;\" but go to men who have honesty\r\nand modesty enough to send you a sample of their best plants, if\r\nrequired, and who are not averse to let you see how they grow them.\r\nChoose their good, strong healthy, one year old plants, with strong,\r\nfirm, healthy roots, and let those who wish to be humbugged buy the\r\nlayers for _immediate_ bearing. You must be content to wait until the\r\nthird year for the first crop; but, then, if you have treated your\r\nplants as you ought to do, you can look for a crop that will make your\r\nheart glad to see and gather it. You cannot, in reason and nature\r\nexpect it sooner. If your ground has been prepared in the Fall, so much\r\nthe better, and if thrown into ridges, so as to elevate the ground\r\nsomewhat, where the row is to be, they may be planted in the Fall. The\r\nadvantages of Fall planting are as follows: The ground will generally\r\nwork better, as we have better weather in the Fall; and generally more\r\ntime to spare; the ground can settle among the roots; the roots will\r\nhave healed and callused over, and the young plant be ready to start\r\nwith full vigor in spring.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 5.]\r\n\r\nMark your ground, laying it off with a line, and put down a small stick\r\nor peg, eighteen inches long, wherever a plant is to stand. Dig a hole,\r\nabout eight to ten inches deep, as shown in Figure 5, in a slanting\r\ndirection, raising a small mound in the bottom, of well-pulverized,\r\nmellow earth; then, having pruned your plant as shown in Figure 6, with\r\nits roots and tops shortened in, as shown by the dotted lines, lay it\r\nin, resting the lower end on the mound of earth, spread out its roots\r\nevenly to all sides, and then fill in among the roots with rich,\r\nwell-pulverized earth, the upper bud being left above the ground. When\r\nplanted in the fall, raise a small mound around your vine, so that the\r\nwater will drain off, and throw a handful of straw or any other mulch\r\non top, to protect it. Of course, the operation should be performed\r\nwhen the ground is dry enough to be light and mellow, and will readily\r\nwork in among the roots.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 6.]\r\n\r\n\r\nTREATMENT OF THE VINE THE FIRST SUMMER.\r\n\r\nThe first summer after planting nothing is necessary but to keep the\r\nground free from weeds, and mellow, stirring freely with hoe, rake,\r\nplough, and cultivator, whenever necessary. Should the vines grow\r\nstrong they may be tied to the stakes provided in planting, to elevate\r\nthem somewhat above the ground. Allow all the laterals to grow, as it\r\nwill make the wood stronger and more stocky. They may even be\r\nsummer-layered in July, laying down the young cane, and covering the\r\nmain stem about an inch deep with mellow soil, leaving the ends of the\r\nlaterals out of the ground. With free-growing kinds, such as the\r\nConcord and Hartford Prolific, these will generally root readily, and\r\nmake very good plants, the laterals making the stems of the layers.\r\nWith varieties that do not root so readily, as the Delaware and\r\nNorton's Virginia, it will seldom be successful, and should not be\r\npracticed. The vineyard may thus be made to pay expenses, and furnish\r\nthe vines for further plantations the first year. They are taken up and\r\ndivided in the fall, as directed in the chapter for layers. In the\r\nfall, prune the vine to three buds, if strong enough, to one or two if\r\nit has only made a weak growth. A fair growth is from four to five feet\r\nthe first summer. During the winter, trellis should be provided for the\r\nvines, as we may expect them to grow from twelve to fifteen feet the\r\ncoming summer. The cheapest and most economical are those of strong\r\nupright posts, say four inches in diameter, made of red cedar if it can\r\nbe had, if not, of any good, durable timber--mulberry, locust, or white\r\noak--and seven feet long, along which No. 10 wire is stretched\r\nhorizontally. Make the holes for the posts with a post-hole auger, two\r\nfeet deep; set in the posts, charred on one end, to make them durable.\r\nIf wire is to be used, one post every sixteen feet will be enough, with\r\na smaller stake between, to serve as a support for the wires. Now\r\nstretch your wire, the lowest one about two feet from the ground, the\r\nsecond one eighteen inches above it, and the third eighteen inches\r\nabove the second. The wires may be fastened to the posts by nails,\r\naround which they can be twisted, or by loops of wire driven into the\r\npost. Where timber is plenty, laths made of black oak may be made to\r\nserve the same purpose; but the posts must then be set much closer, and\r\nthe wire will be the cheapest and neatest in the end. A good many\r\ngrape-growers train their vines to stakes, believing it to be cheaper,\r\nbut I have found it more expensive than trellis made in the above\r\nmanner, and it is certainly a very slovenly method, compared with the\r\nlatter. Trellis is much more convenient for tying the vines, the canes\r\ncan be distributed much more evenly, and the fruit and young wood, not\r\nbeing huddled and crowded together as on stakes, will ripen much more\r\nevenly, and be of better quality, as the air and sun have free access\r\nto it.\r\n\r\n\r\nTREATMENT OF THE VINE THE SECOND SUMMER.\r\n\r\nWe find the young vine at the commencement of this season pruned to\r\nthree buds of the last season's growth. From these we may expect from\r\ntwo to three strong shoots or canes. Our first work will be to\r\ncultivate the whole ground, say from four to six inches deep, ploughing\r\nbetween the rows, and hoeing around the vines with a two-pronged German\r\nhoe, or _karst_. Figure 7 shows one of these implements, of the best\r\nform for that purpose. The ground should be completely inverted, but\r\nnever do it in wet weather, as this will make the ground hard and\r\ncloggy.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 7.]\r\n\r\nOf the young shoots, if there are three, leave only the two strongest,\r\ntying the best of them neatly to the trellis with bass, or pawpaw bark,\r\nor rye straw. If a Catawba or Delaware, you may let them grow\r\nunchecked, tying them along the uppermost wire, when they have grown\r\nabove it. The Concord, Herbemont, Norton's Virginia, and other\r\nstrong-growing varieties, I treat in the following manner: When the\r\nyoung shoot has reached the second wire I pinch off its leader. This\r\nhas the tendency to force the laterals into stronger growth, each\r\nforming a medium-sized cane. On these we intend to grow our fruit the\r\ncoming season, as the buds on these laterals will generally produce\r\nmore and finer fruit than the buds on the strong canes. Figure 8 will\r\nshow the manner of training the second summer, with one cane layered,\r\nfor the purpose of raising plants. This is done as described before;\r\nonly, as the vine will make a much stronger growth this season than the\r\nfirst, the layering maybe done in June, as soon as the young shoots are\r\nstrong enough. Figure 9 shows the vine pruned and tied, at the end of\r\nthe second season. Figure 10 illustrates the manner of training and\r\ntying the Catawba or Delaware.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 8.    FIG. 9.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 10.]\r\n\r\nThe above is a combination of the single cane and bow system, and the\r\nhorizontal arm training, which I first tried on the Concord from sheer\r\nnecessity; when the results pleased me so much that I have adopted it\r\nwith all strong-growing varieties. The circumstances which led me to\r\nthe trial of this method were as follows: In the summer of 1862, when\r\nmy Concord vines were making their second season's growth, we had, in\r\nthe beginning of June, the most destructive hail storm I have ever seen\r\nhere. Every leaf was cut from the vines, and the young succulent shoots\r\nwere all cut off to about three to three and a half feet above the\r\nground. The vines, being young and vigorous, pushed out the laterals\r\nvigorously, each of them making a fair-sized cane. In the fall, when I\r\ncame to prune them, the main cane was not long enough, and I merely\r\nshortened in the laterals to from four to six buds each. On these I had\r\nas fine a crop of grapes as I ever saw, fine, large, well-developed\r\nbunches and berries, and a great many of them, as each had produced its\r\nfruit-bearing shoot. Since that time I have followed this method\r\naltogether, and obtained the most satisfactory results.\r\n\r\nThe ground should be kept even and mellow during the summer, and the\r\nvines neatly tied to the trellis with bast or straw.\r\n\r\nThere are many other methods of training; for instance, the old bow and\r\nstake training, which is followed to a great extent around Cincinnati,\r\nand was followed to some extent here. But it crowds the whole mass of\r\nfruit and leaves together so closely that mildew and rot will follow\r\nalmost as a natural consequence, and those who follow it are almost\r\nready to give up grape-culture in despair. Nor is this surprising. With\r\ntheir tenacious adherence to so fickle a variety as the Catawba, and to\r\npractices and methods of which experience ought to have taught them the\r\nutter impracticability long ago, we need not be surprised that\r\ngrape-culture is with them a failure. We have a class of grape-growers\r\nwho never learn, nor ever forget, anything; these we cannot expect\r\nshould prosper. The grape-grower, of all others, should be a close\r\nobserver of nature in her various moods, a thinking and a reasoning\r\nbeing; he should be trying and experimenting all the time, and be ready\r\nalways to throw aside his old methods, should he find that another will\r\nmore fully meet the wants of his plants. Only thus can he expect to\r\nprosper.\r\n\r\nThere is also the arm system, of which we hear so much now-a-days, and\r\nwhich certainly looks very pretty _on paper_. But paper is patient, and\r\nwhile it cannot be denied that it has its advantages, if every spur and\r\nshoot could be made to grow just as represented in drawings, with three\r\nfine bunches to each shoot; yet, upon applying it practically, we find\r\nthat vines are stubborn, and some shoots will outgrow others; and\r\nbefore we hardly know how, the whole beautiful system is out of order.\r\nIt may do to follow in gardens, on arbors and walls, with a few vines,\r\nbut I do not think that it will ever be successfully followed in\r\nvineyard culture for a number of years, as it involves too much labor\r\nin tying up, pruning, etc. I think the method described above will more\r\nfully meet the wants of the vinyardist than any I have yet seen tried;\r\nit is so simple that every intelligent person can soon become familiar\r\nwith it, and it gives us new, healthy wood for bearing every season.\r\nPruning may be done in the fall, as soon as the leaves have dropped.\r\n\r\n\r\nTREATMENT OF THE VINE THE THIRD SEASON.\r\n\r\nAt the commencement of the third season, we find our vine pruned to two\r\nspurs of two eyes each, and four lateral canes, of from four to six\r\neyes each. These are tied firmly to the trellis as shown in Figure 12,\r\nfor which purpose small twigs of willows (especially the golden willow,\r\nof which every grape-grower should plant a supply) are the most\r\nconvenient. The ground is ploughed and hoed deeply, as described\r\nbefore, taking care, however, not to plough so deep as to cut or tear\r\nthe roots of the vine.\r\n\r\nOur vines being tied, ploughed, and hoed, we come to one of the most\r\nimportant and delicate operations to be performed; one of as\r\ngreat--nay, greater--importance than pruning. I mean summer-pruning, or\r\npinching, _i.e._ thumb or finger pruning. Fall-pruning, or cutting\r\nback, is but the beginning of the discipline under which we intend to\r\nkeep our vines; summer-pruning is the continuation, and one is useless,\r\nand cannot be followed systematically without the other.\r\n\r\nLet us look at our vine well, before we begin, and commence near the\r\nground. The time to perform the first summer-pruning is when the young\r\nshoots are about six to eight inches long, and when you can see plainly\r\nall the small bunches or buttons--the embryo fruit. We commence on the\r\nlower two spurs, having two buds each. From these two shoots have\r\nstarted. One of them we intend for a bearing cane next summer;\r\ntherefore allow it to grow unchecked for the present, tying it, if long\r\nenough, to the lowest wire. The other, which we intend for a spur again\r\nnext fall, we pinch with thumb and finger to just beyond the last bunch\r\nor button, taking out the leader between the last bunch and the next\r\nleaf, as shown in Figure 11, the cross line indicating where the leader\r\nis to be pinched off. We now come to the next spur, on the opposite\r\nside, where we also leave one cane to grow unchecked, and pinch off the\r\nother. We now go over all the shoots coming from the arms or laterals\r\ntied to the trellis, and also pinch them beyond the last bunch. Should\r\nany of the buds have pushed out two shoots, we rub off the weakest; we\r\nalso take off all barren or weak shoots. If any of them are not\r\nsufficiently developed we pass them over, and go over the vines again,\r\nin a few days after the first pinching.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 11.]\r\n\r\nThis early pinching of the shoot has a tendency to throw all the vigor\r\ninto the development of the young bunch, and the leaves remaining on\r\nthe shoot, which now grow with astonishing rapidity. It is a gentle\r\nchecking, and leading the sap into other channels; not the violent\r\nprocess which is often followed long after the bloom, when the wood has\r\nbecome so hardened that it must be cut with a knife, and by which the\r\nplant is robbed of a large quantity of its leaves, to the injury of\r\nboth fruit and vine. Let any of my readers, who wish to satisfy\r\nthemselves, summer-prune a vine, according to the method described\r\nhere, and leave the next vine until after the bloom, and he will\r\nplainly perceive the difference. The merit of first having practised\r\nthis method here, which I consider one of vast importance in\r\ngrape-culture, belongs to Mr. WILLIAM POESCHEL, of this place, who was\r\nled to do so, by observing the rapid development of the young bunches\r\non a shoot which had accidentally been broken beyond the last bunch.\r\nNow, there is hardly an intelligent grape-grower here, who does not\r\nfollow it; and I think it has added more than one-third to the quantity\r\nand quality of my crop. It also gives a chance to destroy the small,\r\nwhite worm, a species of leaf-folder, which is very troublesome just at\r\nthis time, eating the young fruit and leaves, and which makes its web\r\namong the tender leaves at the end of the shoot.\r\n\r\nThe bearing branches having all been pinched back, we can leave our\r\nvines alone until after the bloom, only tying up the young canes from\r\nthe spurs, should it become necessary. But do not tie them over the\r\nbearing canes, but lead them to the empty space on both sides of the\r\nvine; as our object must be to give the fruit all the air and light we\r\ncan.\r\n\r\nBy the time the grapes have bloomed, the laterals will have pushed from\r\nthe axils of the leaves on the bearing shoots. Now go over these again,\r\nand pinch each lateral back to one leaf, as shown in Figure 12. This\r\nwill make the leaf which remains grow and expand rapidly, serving at\r\nthe same time as a conductor of sap to the young bunch opposite, and\r\nshading it when it becomes fully developed. The canes from the spurs,\r\nwhich we left unchecked, and which we design to bear fruit the next\r\nseason, may now also be stopped or pinched, when they are about three\r\nfeet long, to start their laterals into stronger growth. Pinch off all\r\nthe tendrils; this is a very busy time for the vine-dresser, and upon\r\nhis close attendance and diligence now, depends, in a great measure,\r\nthe value of his crop. Besides, \"a stitch in time saves nine,\" and he\r\ncan save an incredible amount of labor by doing everything at the\r\nproper time.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 12.]\r\n\r\nIn a short time, the laterals on the fruit-bearing branches which have\r\nbeen pinched will throw out suckers again. These are stopped again,\r\nleaving one leaf of the young growth. Leave the laterals on the canes\r\nintended for next years' fruiting to grow unchecked, tying them neatly\r\nwith bass, or pawpaw bark, or with rye straw.\r\n\r\nThis is about all that is necessary for this summer, except an\r\noccasional tying up of a fruiting branch, should its burden become more\r\nthan it can bear. But the majority of the branches will be able to\r\nsustain their fruit without tying, and the young growth which may yet\r\nstart from the laterals may be left unchecked, as it will serve to\r\nshade the fruit when ripening. Of course, the soil must be kept clean\r\nand mellow, as in the former summer. This short pruning is also a\r\npartial preventative against mildew and rot, and the last extremely wet\r\nseason has again shown the importance of letting in light and air to\r\nall parts of the vine; as those vineyards, where a strict system of\r\nearly summer pruning had been followed, did not suffer half as much\r\nfrom rot and mildew as those where the old slovenly method still\r\nprevailed.\r\n\r\nMy readers will perceive, that Fall-pruning, or shortening-in the\r\nripened wood of the vine, and summer-pruning, shortening in and\r\nthinning out the young growth, have one and all the same object in\r\nview, namely, to keep the vine within proper bounds, and concentrate\r\nall its energies for a two-fold object, namely, the production and\r\nripening of the most perfect fruit, and the production of strong,\r\nhealthy wood for the coming season's crop. Both operations are, in\r\nfact, only different parts of one and the same system, of which\r\nsummer-pruning is the preparatory, and fall pruning the finishing part.\r\n\r\nIf we think that a vine is setting more fruit than it is able to bear\r\nand ripen perfectly, we have it in our power to thin it, by taking away\r\nall imperfect bunches, and feeble shoots. We should allow no more wood\r\nto grow than we need for next season's bearing; if we allow three canes\r\nto grow where only two are needed, we waste the energies of the vine,\r\nwhich should all be concentrated upon ripening its fruit in the most\r\nperfect condition, and producing the necessary wood for next season's\r\nbearing, and that of the best and most vigorous quality, but no more.\r\nIf we prune the vine too long, we over-tax its energies; making it bear\r\nmore fruit than it can perfect, and the result will be poor,\r\nbadly-ripened fruit, and small and imperfect wood. If, on the contrary,\r\nwe prune the vine too short, we will have a rank, excessive growth of\r\nwood and leaves, and encourage rot and mildew. Only practice and\r\nexperience will teach us the exact medium, and the observing vintner\r\nwill soon find out where he has been wrong, better than he can be\r\ntaught by a hundred pages of elaborate advice. Different varieties will\r\nrequire different treatment, and it would be foolishness to suppose\r\nthat two varieties so entirely different, as for instance, the Concord\r\nand the Delaware, could be pruned, trained and pinched in the same\r\nmanner. The first, being a rank and vigorous grower, with long joints,\r\nwill require much longer pruning than the latter, which is a\r\nslow-growing, short-jointed vine. Some varieties, the Taylor for\r\ninstance, also the Norton, will fruit better if pruned to spurs on old\r\nwood, than on the young canes; it will therefore be the best policy for\r\nthe vintner in pruning these, to retain the old arms or canes, pruning\r\nall the healthy, strong shoots they have to two buds, as long as the\r\nold arms remain healthy; always, however, growing a young cane to fall\r\nback upon, should the old arm become diseased; whereas, the Catawba and\r\nDelaware, being only moderate growers, will flourish and bear best when\r\npruned short, and to a cane of last season's growth. The Concord and\r\nHerbemont, again, will bear best on the laterals of last season's\r\ngrowth, and should be trained accordingly. Therefore it is, because\r\nonly a few of the common laborers will take the pains to think and\r\nobserve closely, that we find among them but few good vine-dressers.\r\n\r\nAt the end of this season, we find our Concords or Herbemonts, with the\r\nold fruit-bearing cane, and a spur on each side, from which have grown\r\ntwo canes; one of which was stopped, like all other fruit-bearing\r\nbranches, and which we now prune to a spur of two eyes; and another,\r\nwhich was stopped at about three feet, and on which the laterals were\r\nallowed to grow unchecked. We therefore have one of these canes, with\r\nits laterals, on each side of the vine. These laterals are now pruned\r\nprecisely as the last season, each being cut back to from four to six\r\neyes, and the old cane, which has borne fruit, is cut away altogether.\r\nWith Norton's Virginia, Taylor, and some others, which will bear more\r\nreadily on spurs from old wood, the old cane is retained, provided the\r\nshoots on it are sound and healthy, with well developed buds; the weak\r\nones are cut away altogether, and the others cut back to two eyes each.\r\nOne of the canes is pruned, as in the Concord, to be tied to one side\r\nof the trellis, the next spring. This closes our summer and fall\r\npruning for the third year. Of the gathering of the fruit, as well for\r\nmarket as for wine, I shall speak in another chapter.\r\n\r\n\r\nTREATMENT OF THE VINE THE FOURTH SUMMER.\r\n\r\nWe may now consider the vine as established, able to bear a full crop,\r\nand when tied to the trellis in spring, to present the appearance, as\r\nshown in Fig. 13. The operations to be performed are precisely the same\r\nas in its third year.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 13.]\r\n\r\nIn addition, I will here remark, that in wet seasons the soil of the\r\nvineyard should be stirred as little as possible, as it will bake and\r\nclog, and in dry seasons it should be deeply worked and stirred, as\r\nthis loose surface-soil will retain moisture much better than a hard\r\nsurface. Should the vines show a decrease in vigor, they may be manured\r\nwith ashes or compost, or still better, with surface-soil from the\r\nwoods. This will serve to replenish the soil which may have been washed\r\noff and is much more beneficial than stable manure. When the latter is\r\napplied, a small trench should be dug just above the vine, the manure\r\nlaid in, and covered with soil. But an abundance of fresh soil, drawn\r\nup well around the vine, is certainly the best of all manures.\r\n\r\nWhere a vine has failed to grow the first season, replant with extra\r\nstrong vines, as they will find it difficult to catch up with the\r\nothers; or the vacancy can be filled up the next season, by a layer\r\nfrom a neighboring vine, made in the following manner: Dig a trench\r\nfrom the vine to the empty place, about eight to ten inches deep, and\r\nbend into it one of the canes of the vine, left to grow unchecked for\r\nthat purpose, and pruned to the proper length. Let the end of it come\r\nout to the surface of the ground with one or two eyes above it, at the\r\nplace where the vine is to be, and fill up with good, well pulverized\r\nearth. It will strike roots at almost every joint, and grow rapidly,\r\nbut, as it takes a good deal of nourishment from the parent vine, that\r\nmust be pruned much shorter the first year. When the layer has become\r\nwell established, it is cut from the parent vine; generally the second\r\nseason.\r\n\r\nPruning is best done in the fall, but it can be done on mild days all\r\nthrough the winter months, even as late as the middle of March.\r\nFall-pruning will prevent all flow of sap, and the cuttings are also\r\nbetter if made in the fall, and buried in the ground during winter. All\r\nthe sound, well-ripened wood of last season's growth may be made into\r\ncuttings, which may be either planted, as directed in a former chapter,\r\nor sold; and are an accession to the product of the vineyard not to be\r\ndespised, for they will generally defray all expenses of cultivation.\r\n\r\n\r\nTRAINING THE VINES ON ARBORS AND WALLS.\r\n\r\nThis is altogether different from the treatment in vineyards; the first\r\nhas for its object to grow the most perfect fruit, and to bring the\r\nvine, with all its parts, within the easy reach and control of the\r\noperator; in the latter, our object is to cover a large space with\r\nfoliage, for ornament and shade, fruit being but a secondary\r\nconsideration. However, if the vine is treated judiciously, it will\r\nalso produce a large quantity of fruit, although not of as good quality\r\nas in the vineyard.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 14.    FIG. 15.]\r\n\r\nOur first object must be to grow very strong plants, to cover a very\r\nlarge space. Prepare a border by digging a trench two feet deep and\r\nfour feet wide. Fill with rich soil, decomposed leaves, burnt bones,\r\nashes, etc. Into this plant the strongest plants you have, pruned as\r\nfor vineyard planting. Leave but one shoot to grow on them during the\r\nfirst summer, which, if properly treated, will get very strong. Cut\r\nback to three buds the coming fall. These will each throw out a strong\r\nshoot, which should be tied to the arbor they are designed to cover, as\r\nshown in Figure 14, and allowed to grow unchecked. In the fall\r\nfollowing cut each shoot back to three buds, as our first object must\r\nbe to get a good basis for our vines. These will give us nine canes the\r\nthird summer; and as the vine is now thoroughly established and strong,\r\nwe can begin to work in good earnest. It will be perceived that the\r\nvine has three different sections or principal branches, each with\r\nthree canes. Cut one of these back to two eyes, and the other two to\r\nsix or eight buds each, according to the strength of the vine, as shown\r\nin Figure 15. The next spring tie these neatly to the trellis, and when\r\nthe young shoots appear thin out the weakest, and leave the others to\r\ngrow unchecked. The next fall cut back as indicated by the black cross\r\nlines, the weakest to be cut back to one or two eyes, and the stronger\r\nones to three or four, the spurs at the bottom to come in as a reserve,\r\nshould any of the branches become diseased. Figure 16 shows the manner\r\nof pruning.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 16.]\r\n\r\nIn this manner a vine can be made, in course of time, to cover a large\r\nspace, and get very old. The great vine at Windsor Palace was planted\r\nmore than sixty years ago, and in 1850 it produced two thousand large\r\nbunches of magnificent grapes. The space covered by the branches was\r\none hundred and thirty-eight feet long, and sixteen feet wide, and it\r\nhad a stem two feet nine inches in circumference. This is one of the\r\nlargest vines on record. They should, however, be strongly manured to\r\ncome to full perfection.\r\n\r\nOther authorities prefer the Thomery system of training, but I think it\r\nmuch more complicated and difficult to follow. Those wishing to follow\r\nit will find full directions in DR. GRANT'S and FULLER'S books, which\r\nare very explicit on this method.\r\n\r\n\r\nOTHER METHODS OF TRAINING THE VINE.\r\n\r\nThere are many other systems in vogue among vine-dressers in Germany\r\nand France, but as our native grapes are so much stronger in growth,\r\nand are in this climate so much more subject to mildew and rot, I think\r\nthese methods, upon the whole, but poorly adapted to the wants of our\r\nnative grapes, however judicious they may be there. I will only mention\r\na few of them here; one because it is to a great extent followed in\r\nMexico and California, and seems to suit that dry climate and arid soil\r\nvery well; and the other, because it will often serve as a pretty\r\nborder to beds in gardens. The first is the so-called buck or stool\r\nmethod of training. The vine is made to form its head--_i.e._, the part\r\nfrom which the branches start--about a foot above the ground, and all\r\nthe young shoots are allowed to grow, but summer-pruned or checked just\r\nbeyond the last bunch of grapes. The next spring all of the young\r\nshoots are cut back to two eyes, and this system of \"spurring in\" is\r\nkept up, and the vine will in time present the appearance of a bush or\r\nminiature tree, producing all its fruit within a foot from the head,\r\nand without further support than its own stem. Very old vines trained\r\nin this manner often have twenty to twenty-five spurs, and present,\r\nwith their fruit all hanging in masses around the main trunk, a\r\npleasing but rather odd aspect. This method could not be applied here\r\nwith any chance of success only to those varieties which are slow\r\ngrowers, and at the same time very hardy. The Delaware would perhaps be\r\nthe most suitable of all varieties I know for a trial of this method;\r\nsuch strong growers as the Concord and Norton's Virginia could never be\r\nkept within the proper bounds, and it would be useless to try it on\r\nthem. It might be of advantage on poor soil, where there is at the same\r\ntime a scarcity of timber. Figure 17 shows an old vine pruned after\r\nthis method.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 17.]\r\n\r\nThe other method of dwarfing the grape is practiced to make a pretty\r\nborder along walks in gardens, and is as follows: Plant your vines\r\nabout eight feet apart; treat them the first season as in common\r\nvineyard planting, but at the end of the first season cut back to two\r\neyes. Now provide posts, three to three and a half feet long; drive\r\nthem into the ground about eighteen inches to two feet, which can be\r\neasily done if they are pointed at one end, and nail a lath on top of\r\nthem. This is your trellis for the vines, and should be about eighteen\r\ninches above the ground when ready. Now allow both shoots which will\r\nstart from the two buds to grow unchecked; and when they have grown\r\nabove the trellis, tie one down to the right, the other to the left,\r\nallowing them to ramble at will along it. The next fall they are each\r\ncut back to the proper length, to meet the next vine, and in spring\r\ntied firmly to the lath, as shown in Figure 18. When the young shoots\r\nappear, all below the trellis are rubbed off, but all those above the\r\ntrellis are summer-pruned or pinched immediately beyond the last bunch\r\nof grapes, as in vineyard culture, and the trellis, with its garland of\r\nfruit, will present a very pretty appearance throughout the summer. In\r\nthe fall all of these shoots are pruned to one bud, from which will\r\ngrow the fruit-bearing shoot for the next season, as shown in Figure\r\n19; and the same treatment is repeated during the summer and fall.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 18.    FIG. 19.]\r\n\r\n\r\nDISEASES OF THE VINE.\r\n\r\nI cannot agree with Mr. FULLER that the diseases of the vine are not\r\nformidable in this country. They are so formidable that they threaten\r\nto destroy some varieties altogether; and the Catawba, once the glory\r\nand pride of the Ohio vineyards, has for the last fifteen years\r\nsuffered so much from them, that many of the grape-growers who are too\r\nnarrow-minded to try anything else are about giving up grape-growing in\r\ndespair.\r\n\r\nIt is very fortunate, therefore, that we have varieties which do not\r\nsuffer from these diseases, or only in a very slight degree; and my\r\nadvice to the beginner in grape-culture would be, \"not to plant largely\r\nof any variety which is subject to disease.\" Men may talk about\r\nsulphuring, and dusting their vines with sulphur through bellows; but I\r\nwould rather have vines which will bear a good crop without these windy\r\nappliances. We can certainly find some varieties for _every_ locality\r\nwhich do not need them, and these we should plant.\r\n\r\nThe mildew is our most formidable disease, and will very often sweep\r\naway two-thirds of a crop of Catawbas in a few days. It generally\r\nappears here from the first to the fifteenth of June, after abundant\r\nrains, and damp, warm weather. It seems to be a parasitic fungus, and\r\nsulphur applied by means of a bellows, or dusted over the fruit and\r\nvine is said to be a partial remedy. Close and early summer-pruning\r\nwill do much to prevent it, throwing, as it does, all the strength of\r\nthe vine into the young fruit, developing it rapidly, and also allowing\r\nfree circulation of air. In some varieties--for instance, the\r\nDelaware--it will only affect the leaves, causing them to blight and\r\ndrop off, after which the fruit, although it may attain full size, will\r\nnot ripen nor become sweet, but wither and drop off prematurely. In\r\nseasons when the weather is dry and the air pure, it will not appear.\r\nIt is most prevalent in locations which have a tenacious subsoil, and\r\nunder-draining will very likely prove a partial preventive, as excess\r\nof moisture about the roots is no doubt one of its causes.\r\n\r\nThe gray rot, or so-called grape cholera, generally follows the mildew,\r\nand I think that the latter is the principal cause of it, as I have\r\ngenerally found it on berries whose stems have been injured by the\r\nmildew. The berry first shows a sort of gray marbling; in a day or two\r\nit turns to a grayish-blue color, and finally withers and drops from\r\nthe bunch. It will continue to affect berries until they begin to\r\ncolor, but only attack a few varieties--the Catawba, To Kalon,\r\nKingsessing, and sometimes the Diana.\r\n\r\nThe spotted, or brown rot, will also attack many of our varieties; it\r\nis very destructive to the Isabella and Catawba, and even the Concord\r\nis not quite free from it. But it is, after all, not very destructive,\r\nand not half as dangerous as the mildew or gray rot.\r\n\r\nEarly and close summer-pruning is a partial preventative against all\r\nthese diseases, as it will hasten the development of the fruit, allow\r\nfree circulation of air, and the young leaves which appear on the\r\nlaterals after pinching seem to be better able to withstand the effects\r\nof the mildew, often remaining fresh and green, and shading the fruit,\r\nwhen the first growth of leaves have already dropped.\r\n\r\nBut \"an ounce of prevention is better than a pound of cure,\" and our\r\nbest preventive is to plant none but healthy varieties. A grape,\r\nhowever good it may be in quality, is not fit for general cultivation\r\nif seriously affected with any of these diseases. Nothing can be more\r\ndiscouraging to the grape-grower than to see his vines one day rich in\r\nthe promise of an abundant crop, and a few days afterwards see\r\ntwo-thirds or three-fourths swept away by disease. It is because I have\r\nso often felt this bitter disappointment, that I would warn my readers\r\nagainst planting varieties subject to them. I would save _them_ from\r\nthe discouragement and bitter losses which I have experienced, when it\r\nwas out of my power to prevent it. They _can_ prevent it, for the\r\ngrape-growing of to-day is no longer the same uncertain occupation it\r\nwas ten years ago. We of to-day have our choice of varieties not\r\nsubject to disease; let us make it judiciously, and we may be sure of a\r\npaying crop every year.\r\n\r\n\r\nINSECTS INJURIOUS TO THE GRAPE.\r\n\r\nThe grape has many enemies of this kind, but if they are closely\r\nwatched from the beginning their ravages are easily kept within proper\r\nbounds.\r\n\r\nThe common gray cut-worm will often eat the young tender shoots of the\r\nvine, and draw them into the ground below. Wherever this is perceived\r\nthe rascal can easily be found by digging for him under some of the\r\nloose clods of ground below the vine, and should be destroyed without\r\nmercy.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 20.\r\nDELAWARE.--_Berries 1/2 diameter_.]\r\n\r\nSmall worms, belonging to the family of leaf-folders, some of them\r\nwhitish gray, some bluish green, will in spring make their webs among\r\nthe young, downy leaves at the end of the shoots, eating the young\r\nbunches or buttons, and the leaves. These can be destroyed when summer\r\npruning for the first time. Look close for them, as they are very\r\nsmall; yet very destructive if let alone.\r\n\r\nA small, gray beetle, of about the size and color of a hemp-seed, will\r\noften eat a hole into the bud, when it is just swelling, and thus\r\ndestroy it. He is very shy, and will drop from the vine as soon as you\r\ncome near him. It is a good plan to spread a newspaper under the vine,\r\nand then shake it, when he will drop on the paper and can be caught.\r\n\r\nAnother bug, of about the size of a fly, gray, with round black specks,\r\nwill sometimes pay us a visit. They will come in swarms, and eat the\r\nupper side of the leaves, leaving only the skeletons. They are very\r\ndestructive, devouring every leaf, as far as they go; they can also be\r\nshaken off on a paper or sheet spread under the vine.\r\n\r\nThe thrip, a small, rather three-cornered, whitish-green insect, has of\r\nlate been very troublesome, as they eat the under side of the leaves of\r\nsome varieties, especially the Delaware and Norton's Virginia, when the\r\nleaf will show rusty specks on the surface, and finally drop off. It\r\nhas been recommended to go through the vineyard at night, one man\r\ncarrying a lighted torch, and the other beating the vines, when they\r\nwill fly into the flame, and be burnt. They are a great annoyance, and\r\nhave defoliated whole vineyards here last fall.\r\n\r\nAnother leaf-folder makes his appearance about mid-summer, making its\r\nweb on the leaf, drawing it together, and then devouring his own house.\r\nIt is a small, greenish, and very active worm, who, if he \"smells a\r\nrat,\" will drop out of his web, and descend to the ground in\r\ndouble-quick time. I know of no other plan, than to catch him and crush\r\nhis web between the finger and thumb.\r\n\r\nThe aphis, or plant louse, often covers the young shoots of the vine,\r\nsucking its juices. When a shoot is attacked by them, it will be best\r\nto take it off and crush them under your feet, as the shoot is apt to\r\nbe sickly afterwards, any way.\r\n\r\nThe grape vine sphynx will be found occasionally. It is a large, green\r\nworm, with black dots, and very voracious. Fortunately, it is not\r\nnumerous, and can easily be found and destroyed.\r\n\r\nThere are also several caterpillars--the yellow bear, the hog\r\ncaterpillar, and the blue caterpillar, which will feed upon the leaves.\r\nThe only remedy I know against them is hand picking, but they have not\r\nas yet been very numerous, nor very destructive.\r\n\r\nWasps are sometimes very troublesome when the fruit ripens, stinging\r\nthe berries and sucking the juice. A great many can be caught by\r\nhanging up bottles, with a little molasses, which they will enter, and\r\nget stuck in the molasses.\r\n\r\n\r\nBIRDS.\r\n\r\nThese are sometimes very troublesome at the time of ripening, and\r\nespecially the oriole is a \"hard customer,\" as he will generally dip\r\nhis bill into every berry; often ruining a fine bunch, or a number of\r\nthem, in a short time. I have therefore been compelled to wage a war\r\nupon some of the feathered tribe, although they are my especial\r\nfavorites, and I cannot see a bird's nest robbed. However, there are\r\nsome who do not visit the vineyard, except for the purpose of\r\ndestroying our grapes, and these can not complain if we \"won't stand it\r\nany longer,\" but take the gun, and retaliate on them. The oriole, the\r\nred bird, thrush, and cat bird are among the number, and although I\r\nwould like to spare the latter three, in thankful remembrance of many a\r\ngratuitous concert, the first must take his chance of powder and lead,\r\nfor the little rascal is too aggravating. A few dry bushes, raised\r\nabove the trellis will serve as their resting place before they\r\ncommence their work of destruction, where they can be easily killed.\r\n\r\n\r\nFROSTS.\r\n\r\nAlthough our winters are seldom severe enough to destroy the hardy\r\nvarieties, yet they will often fatally injure such half hardy varieties\r\nas the Herbemont and Cunningham, and the severe winter of 1863,-'64,\r\nkilled even the Catawba, down to the snow line, and severely injured\r\nthe Norton's Virginia, and even the Concord. Fortunately, such winters\r\noccur but rarely, and even in localities where the vines are often\r\ndestroyed by the severe cold in winter, this should deter no one from\r\ngrowing grapes, as, with very little extra labor he can protect them,\r\nand bring them safely through the winter. I always cover my tender\r\nvarieties, in fact, all that I feel not quite safe to leave out, even\r\nin severe winters, in the following manner: The vines are properly\r\npruned in the fall; then select a somewhat rainy day, when the canes\r\nwill bend more easily. One man goes through the rows, and bends the\r\ncanes to the ground along the trellis, while another follows with the\r\nspade, and throws earth enough on them to hold them in their places.\r\nAfterwards, I run a plough through the rows, and cover them up\r\ncompletely. In the spring when all danger from frost is over, I take a\r\nso-called spading fork, and lift the vines. The entire cost of covering\r\nan acre of grape vines and taking them up again in spring, will not\r\nexceed $10; surely a trifling expense, if we can thereby ensure a full\r\ncrop.\r\n\r\nWe have thus a protection against the cold in winter, but I know none\r\nagainst early frosts, in fall, and late spring frosts; and the grape\r\ngrower should therefore avoid all localities where they are prevalent.\r\nThe immediate neighborhood of large streams, or lakes, will generally\r\nsave the grape grower from their disastrous influence; and our summers,\r\nhere, along the banks of the Missouri river, are in reality full two\r\nmonths longer than they are in the low, small valleys, only four to six\r\nmiles off. Let the grape grower, in choosing a locality, look well to\r\nthis, and avoid the hills along these narrow valleys. Either choose a\r\nlocation sufficiently elevated, to be beyond their influence, or, what\r\nis better still, choose it on the bluffs above our large streams; where\r\nthe atmosphere, even in the heat of summer, will never become too dry\r\nfor the health of the vine. It is a sad spectacle to see the hopes of a\r\nwhole summer frustrated by one cold night; to see the vines which\r\npromised an abundant crop but the day before, browned and wilted beyond\r\nall hopes of recovery, and the cheerless prospect before you, that it\r\nmay occur every spring; or to see the finest crop of grapes, when just\r\nripening, scorched and wilted by just one night's frost, fit for\r\nnothing but vinegar. Therefore, look well to this, when you choose the\r\nsite of your vineyard, and rather pay five times the price for a\r\nlocation free from frost, than for the richest farm along the so-called\r\ncreek bottoms, or worse still, sloughs of stagnant water.\r\n\r\n\r\nGIRDLING THE VINE TO HASTEN MATURITY.\r\n\r\nThe practice of girdling to induce early ripening is supposed to have\r\nbeen invented by Col. BUCHATT, of Metz, in 1745. He claimed for it that\r\nit would also greatly improve the quality of the fruit, as well as\r\nhasten maturity. That it accomplishes the latter, cannot be denied; it\r\nalso seems to increase the size of the berries, but I hardly think the\r\nfruit can compare in flavor with a well developed bunch, ripened in the\r\nnatural way. As it may be of practical value to those who grow grapes\r\nfor the market, enabling them to supply their customers a week earlier\r\nat least, and also make the fruit look better, and be of interest to\r\nthe amateur cultivator, I will describe the operation for their\r\nbenefit.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 21\r\nNORTON'S VIRGINIA--_Berries 1/3 diameter._]\r\n\r\nIt can be performed either on wood of the same season's growth, or on\r\nthat of last year, but in any case only upon such as can be pruned away\r\nthe next fall. If you desire to affect the fruit of a whole arm or\r\ncane, cut away a ring of bark by passing your knife all around it, and\r\nmaking another incision from a quarter to half an inch above the first,\r\ntaking out the intermediate piece of bark clean, down to the wood. It\r\nshould be performed immediately after the fruit is set. The bunches of\r\nfruit above the incision will become larger, and the fruit ripen and\r\ncolor finely, from a week to ten days before the fruit on the other\r\ncanes. Of course, the cane thus girdled, cannot be used for the next\r\nseason, and must be cut away entirely. The result seems to be the\r\nconsequence of an obstruction to the downward flow of the sap, which\r\nthen develops the fruit much faster.\r\n\r\nRipening can also be hastened by planting against the south side of a\r\nwall or board fence, when the reflection of the rays of the sun will\r\ncreate a greater degree of warmth.\r\n\r\nBut nothing can be so absurd and unnatural than the practice of some,\r\nwho will take away the leaves from the fruit, to hasten its ripening.\r\nThe leaves are the lungs of the plants; the conductors and elevators of\r\nsap; and nothing can be more injurious than to take them away from the\r\nfruit at the very time when they are most needed. The consequence of\r\nsuch an unwise course will be the wilting and withering of the bunches,\r\nand, should they ripen at all, they will be deficient in flavor. Good\r\nfruit must ripen _in the shade_, only thus will it attain its full\r\nperfection.\r\n\r\nAnother practice very injurious to the vines is still in practice in\r\nsome vineyards, and cannot be too strongly condemned. It is the\r\nso-called \"cutting in\" of the young growth in August. Those who\r\npractice it, seem to labor under the misapprehension that the young\r\ncanes, after they have reached the top of the trellis, and are of the\r\nproper length and strength for their next year's crop, do not need that\r\npart of the young growth beyond these limits any more, and that all the\r\nsurplus growth is \"of evil.\" Under the influence of this idea they arm\r\nthemselves with a villainous looking thing called a bill-hook, and cut\r\nand slash away at the young growth unmercifully, taking away one-half\r\nof the leaves and young wood at one fell swoop. The consequence is a\r\nstagnation of sap: the wood they have left, cannot, and ought not to\r\nripen perfectly, and if anything like a cold winter follows, the vines\r\nwill either be killed entirely, or very much injured at least. The\r\nintelligent vine dresser will tie his young canes, away from the\r\nbearing wood as much as he can, to give the fruit the fullest\r\nventilation; but when they have reached the top of the trellis, tie\r\nthem along it and let them ramble as they please. They will thus form a\r\nnatural roof over the fruit, keep off all injurious dews, and shade the\r\ngrapes from above. There is nothing more pleasing to the eye than a\r\nvineyard in September, with its wealth of dark green foliage above, and\r\nits purple clusters of fruit beneath, coyly peeping from under their\r\nleafy covering. Such grapes will have an exquisite bloom, and color, as\r\nwell as thin skin and rich flavor, which those hanging in the scorching\r\nrays of the sun can never attain.\r\n\r\n\r\nMANURING THE VINE.\r\n\r\nAs remarked before, this will seldom be necessary, if the vintner is\r\ncareful enough to guard against washing of the top-soil, and to turn\r\nunder all leaves, etc., with the plow in the Fall. The best manure is\r\nundoubtedly fresh surface soil from the woods. Should the vines,\r\nhowever, show a material decrease in vigor, it may become necessary to\r\nuse a top-dressing of decomposed leaves, ashes, bone-dust, charcoal,\r\netc. Fresh stable-yard manure I would consider the last, and only to be\r\nused when nothing better can be obtained. Turn under with the plow, as\r\nsoon as the manure is spread. Nothing, I think, is more injurious than\r\nthe continual drenching with slops, dish-water, etc., which some good\r\nsouls of housewives are fond of bestowing on their pet grape vines in\r\nthe garden. It creates a rank, unwholesome growth, and will cause\r\nmildew and rot, if anything can.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHINNING OF THE FRUIT.\r\n\r\nThis will sometimes be necessary, to more fully develop the bunches.\r\nThe best thinning is the reduction of the number of bunches at the time\r\nof the first summer pruning. If a vine shows more fruit, than the vine\r\ndresser thinks it can well ripen, take away all weak and imperfect\r\nshoots, and also all the small and imperfect bunches. If the number of\r\nbunches on the fruit bearing branches is reduced to two on each, it\r\nwill be no injury, but make the remaining number of bunches so much\r\nmore perfect. Thinning out the berries on the bunches, although it will\r\nserve to make the remaining berries more perfect and larger, is still a\r\nvery laborious process, and will hardly be followed to any extent in\r\nvineyards, although it can well be practised on the few pet vines of\r\nthe amateur, and will certainly heighten the beauty of the bunches and\r\nberries.\r\n\r\n\r\nRENEWING OLD VINES.\r\n\r\nShould a vine become old and feeble, it can be renewed by layering. The\r\nvine is prepared in the following manner: Prune all the old wood away,\r\nleaving but one of the most vigorous of your canes; then dig a trench\r\nfrom the vine along the trellis, say three feet long, eight inches\r\ndeep; into this bend down the old vine, stump, head and all, fastening\r\nit down with a strong hook, if necessary, letting the end of the young\r\ncane come out about three eyes above the ground, and fill up with rich,\r\nwell pulverized soil. The vine will make new roots at every joint, and\r\nbecome vigorous, and, so to say, young, again. Some recommend this\r\nprocess for young vines, the first year after planting; but if good\r\nplants have been chosen and planted, it will not be necessary. Feeble\r\nand poor plants may need this process, but if plants have good strong\r\nroots when planted, (and _only_ such should be planted when they can be\r\nobtained), they will not be benefited by it.\r\n\r\n\r\nA FEW NECESSARY IMPROVEMENTS.\r\n\r\n_Pruning Shears._ These are very handy, and with them the work can be\r\ndone quicker, and with less labor, as but a slight pressure of the hand\r\nwill cut a strong vine. Fig. 22 will show the shape of one for heavy\r\npruning. They are made by J. T. HENRY, Hampden, Connecticut, and can be\r\nhad in almost all hardware stores. The springs should be of brass, as\r\nsteel springs are very apt to break. A much lighter and smaller kind,\r\nwith but one spring, is very convenient for gathering grapes, as it\r\nwill cut the stem easily and smoothly, and not shake the vine, as\r\ncutting with the knife will do. They are also handy to clip out unripe\r\nand rotten berries, and should be generally used instead of knives.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 22]\r\n\r\n_Pruning Saws._ It will sometimes be necessary to use these, to cut out\r\nold stumps, etc., although, if a vine is well managed, it will seldom\r\nbe necessary. Fig. 23 will show a kind which is very convenient for the\r\npurpose, and will also serve for orchard pruning; the blade is narrow,\r\nconnected with the handle, and can be turned in any direction.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 23.]\r\n\r\n\r\nGATHERING THE FRUIT FOR MARKET.\r\n\r\nIn this, the vineyardist, of course, only aims at profit, and for that\r\npurpose the grapes are often gathered when they are hardly\r\ncolored--long before they are really ripe--because the public will\r\ngenerally buy them at a high price. Let us hope, however, that better\r\ntaste will in time prevail, and that even a majority of the public will\r\nlearn to appreciate the difference between ripe and unripe fruit. I\r\nwould advise my readers at least to wait until the fruit is fully and\r\nevenly colored; for it is our duty to do all we can to correct this\r\nvicious leaning towards swallowing unripe fruit, which is so prevalent\r\nin this nation, and the producer will not lose anything either, because\r\nhis fruit will look much better, it will therefore bring the same price\r\nwhich half ripened fruit would have brought, even a week sooner, and\r\nwill weigh heavier. Every grape will generally color full two weeks\r\nbefore it is fully ripe; and as they are one of the fruits that will\r\nnot ripen _after_ they are gathered, they will shrivel and look\r\nindifferent if gathered before.\r\n\r\nTo ship them to market any distance, they should be packed in low,\r\nshallow boxes, say six inches high, so that they will hold about two\r\nlayers of grapes. Cut the branches carefully, with as long a stem as\r\npossible, for more convenient handling, taking care to preserve all the\r\nbloom, and clipping out all the unripe berries. They are generally\r\nweighed in the basket before packing. Now put a layer of vine leaves on\r\nthe bottom of the box; then make a layer of grapes, laying them as\r\nclose as possible; then put a layer of leaves over them; on them put\r\nanother layer of grapes, filling up evenly; then spread leaves rather\r\nthickly over them, and nail on the cover. The box should be perforated\r\nwith holes, to admit some air. The grapes must be perfectly dry when\r\ngathered, and the box should be well filled to prevent shaking and\r\nbruising.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRESERVING THE FRUIT.\r\n\r\nFor this purpose, the fruit must be thoroughly ripe. When fully ripe,\r\nthe stem will turn brown, and shrivel somewhat. The fruit is then\r\ncarefully gathered, and laid upon a dry floor, or shelves, for a day or\r\ntwo, so that some of the moisture will evaporate. They can then be\r\npacked in boxes, in about the same manner as described before, but\r\npaper will be better than leaves for this purpose. They are then put\r\naway on shelves, in an airy room, which must, however, be free from\r\nfrost, in an even temperature of from 30° to 40°. They should be\r\nexamined from time to time, and the decayed berries taken out. They may\r\nthus be kept for several months.\r\n\r\n\r\nGATHERING THE FRUIT TO MAKE WINE.\r\n\r\nFor this purpose, the grapes should hang as long as it is safe to allow\r\nthem; for it will make a very material difference in the quality of the\r\nwine, as the water will evaporate, and only the sugar remain; and the\r\nflavor or the bouquet will only be fully developed in fully ripened\r\nfruit. For gathering, use clean tin or wooden pails; cut the stems as\r\nshort as possible, and clip or pinch out all unripe or rotten berries,\r\nleaving none but fully ripe berries on the bunch. The further process\r\nwill be described under \"wine making.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVARIETIES OF GRAPES.\r\n\r\n\r\nI would here, again remark, that I consider the question of \"what to\r\nplant\" as chiefly a local one, for which I do not presume to lay down\r\nfixed rules; but which every one must, to a certain extent, determine\r\nfor himself, by visiting vineyards as nearly similar in soil and\r\nlocation to the one he intends to plant, and then closely observing the\r\nhabits of the varieties after planting. Only thus can we obtain certain\r\nresults; not by following blindly in the footsteps of so-called\r\nauthorities, who may live a hundred, or a thousand miles from us, and\r\nwhose success with certain varieties, on soil entirely different from\r\nours, under different atmospheric influences, can by no means be taken\r\nby us as evidence of our success under other circumstances.\r\n\r\n\r\nCLASS 1.--_Varieties most generally used._\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCORD.\r\n\r\nOriginated with Mr. E. BULL, of Concord, Mass. This variety seems to be\r\nthe choice of the majority throughout the country, and however much\r\nopinions may differ about its quality, nobody seems to question its\r\nhardiness, productiveness, health and value as a market fruit. Here it\r\nis of very good quality--and our Eastern brethren have no idea what a\r\nreally well ripened Missouri grown Concord grape is. It seems to become\r\nbetter the further it is grown West and South; an observation which I\r\nthink applies with equal force to the Hartford Prolific, Norton's\r\nVirginia, Herbemont and others.\r\n\r\nBunch large, heavy shouldered--somewhat compact; berries large, round,\r\nblack, with blue bloom; buttery, sweet and rich _here_, when well\r\nripened; with very thin skin and tender pulp. A strong and vigorous\r\ngrower; with healthy, hardy foliage; free from mildew, and but slightly\r\nsubject to rot; succeeds well in almost any soil; and is, so far, the\r\nmost profitable grape we grow. A fine market fruit, and also makes a\r\nfine, light red wine, which is generally preferred to the Catawba. Can\r\nbe easily grown from cuttings.\r\n\r\n\r\nNORTON'S VIRGINIA, (NORTON'S SEEDLING, VIRGINIA SEEDLING).\r\n\r\nOriginated by DR. N. NORTON, of Richmond, Virginia. This grape has\r\nopened a new era in American grape culture, and every successive year\r\nbut adds to its reputation. While the wine of the Catawba is often\r\ncompared to Hock, in the wine of Norton's Virginia, we have one of an\r\nentirely different character; and it is a conceded fact that the best\r\nred wines of Europe are surpassed by the Norton as an astringent, dark\r\nred wine, of great body, fine flavor, and superior medical quality.\r\nVine vigorous and hardy, productive; starting a week later in the\r\nSpring than the Catawba, yet coloring a week sooner; and will succeed\r\nin almost any soil, although producing the richest wine in warm,\r\nsouthern aspects. Bunches medium, compact; berries small, black, sweet\r\nand rich; with dark bluish red juice; only moderately juicy. Healthy in\r\nall locations, as far as I know, but I doubt its utility in the East,\r\nas I do not think the summers warm and long enough. Seems to attain its\r\ngreatest perfection in Missouri, but is universally esteemed in the\r\nWest. Very difficult to propagate, as it will hardly grow from cuttings\r\nin open air.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 24.\r\nHERBEMONT.--_Berries 1/3 diameter._]\r\n\r\n\r\nHERBEMONT (HERBEMONT MADEIRA, WARREN).\r\n\r\nOrigin uncertain. Wherever this noble grape will succeed and fully\r\nripen, it is hard to find a better, for table, as well as for wine. Its\r\nhome seems to be the South; and I think it will become one of the\r\nleading varieties, as soon as the new order of things has been fully\r\nestablished, and free, intelligent labor has taken the place of the\r\ndrudging, dull toil of the slave. It is particularly fond of warm,\r\nsouthern exposures, with light limestone soil, and it would be useless\r\nto plant it on soil retentive of moisture. Bunch long, large shouldered\r\nand compact; berry medium, black, with blue bloom--\"bags of wine,\" as\r\nDowning fitly calls them; skin thin, sweet flesh, without pulp, juicy\r\nand high flavored, never clogs the palate; fine for the table, and\r\nmakes an excellent wine, which should be pressed immediately after\r\nmashing the grapes, when it will be white, and of an exquisite flavor;\r\ngenerally ripens about same time as Catawba. A very vigorous and\r\nhealthy grower, but tender in rich soils, and should be protected in\r\nwinter. Extremely productive.\r\n\r\n\r\nHARTFORD PROLIFIC.\r\n\r\nRaised by Mr. STEEL, of Hartford, Conn.: hardy, vigorous and\r\nproductive; bunch large, shouldered, rather compact; berry full medium,\r\nglobular, with a perceptible foxy flavor; skin thick, black, covered\r\nwith blue bloom; flesh sweet, juicy; much better here than at the East;\r\nof very fair quality for its time of ripening; hangs well to the bunch\r\nhere, although said to drop at the East. For market, this is perhaps as\r\nprofitable as any variety known, as it ripens very early and uniformly,\r\nproducing immense crops. I have made wine from it, which, although not\r\nof very high character, yet ranks as fair.\r\n\r\n\r\nCLINTON.\r\n\r\nOrigin uncertain; from Western New York; vigorous, hardy and\r\nproductive; free from disease; bunch medium, long and narrow, generally\r\nshouldered, compact; berry medium, roundish oblong, black, covered with\r\nbloom; juicy; somewhat acid; colors early, but should hang late to\r\nbecome thoroughly ripe; brisk vinous flavor, but somewhat of the aroma\r\nof the frost grape; makes a dark red wine, of good body, and much\r\nresembling claret, but not equal to Norton's Virginia, or even the\r\nConcord, in my estimation. Although safe and reliable, I think it has\r\nlately been over praised as a wine grape, and as it is a very long,\r\nstraggling grower, it is one of the hardest vines to keep under\r\ncontrol. Propagates with the greatest ease.\r\n\r\n\r\nDELAWARE.\r\n\r\nFirst disseminated and made known to the public by Mr. A. THOMPSON, of\r\nDelaware, Ohio. This is claimed by many to be the best American grape;\r\nand although I am inclined to doubt this, and prefer, for my taste, a\r\nwell ripened Herbemont, it is certainly a very fine fruit.\r\nUnfortunately, it is very particular in its choice of soil and\r\nlocation, and it seems as if there are very few locations at the West\r\nwhere it will succeed. Whoever has a location, however, where it will\r\ngrow vigorously and hold its leaves, will do well to plant it almost\r\nexclusively, as it makes a wine of very high character, and is very\r\nproductive. A light, warm soil seems to be the first requisite, and the\r\nbluffs on the north side of the Missouri river seem to be peculiarly\r\nadapted to it, while it will not flourish on those on the south side.\r\nBunch small, compact, and generally shouldered; berry below medium,\r\nround; skin thin, of a beautiful flesh-color, covered with a lilac\r\nbloom; very translucent; pulp sweet and tender, vinous and delicious;\r\nwood very firm; short-jointed; somewhat difficult to propagate, though\r\nnot so much so as Norton's Virginia. Subject in many locations, to\r\nleaf-blight, and is _there_ a very slow grower. Fine for the table, and\r\nmakes an excellent white wine, equal to, if not superior, to the best\r\nRhenish wines, which sells readily at from five to six dollars per\r\ngallon. Although I cannot recommend it for general cultivation, it\r\nshould be tried every where, and planted extensively where it will\r\nsucceed. Ripens about five days later than Hartford Prolific.\r\n\r\n\r\nCLASS 2.--_Healthy varieties promising well_.\r\n\r\n\r\nCYNTHIANA (RED RIVER).\r\n\r\nOrigin unknown--said to come from Arkansas. This grape promises fair to\r\nbecome a dangerous rival to Norton's Virginia, which variety it\r\nresembles so closely in wood and foliage, that it is difficult if not\r\nimpossible to distinguish it from that variety. The bunch and berry are\r\nof the same color as Norton's Virginia, but somewhat larger, and more\r\njuicy; sweeter, with not quite as much astringency, and perhaps a few\r\ndays earlier. Makes an excellent dark red wine, with not as much\r\nastringency, but even more delicate aroma, and was pronounced the \"best\r\nred wine on exhibition,\" at the last meeting of the State Horticultural\r\nSociety, where it was in competition with eight samples of the Norton's\r\nVirginia. A strong grower, and productive; as difficult to propagate as\r\nthe Norton. Mr. FULLER evidently has not the true variety, when he\r\ncalls it worthless, and identical with the Chippewa and Missouri, from\r\nboth of which it is entirely distinct.\r\n\r\n\r\nARKANSAS.\r\n\r\nClosely resembles the foregoing, and will also make an excellent wine\r\nof a similar character. I consider both of these varieties as great\r\nacquisitions, as they are perfectly healthy, very productive, and will\r\nmake a wine unsurpassed in merit by any of their class.\r\n\r\n\r\nTAYLOR (BULLITT.)\r\n\r\nThis grape, under proper treatment, has proved very productive with me,\r\nand will make a wine of very high quality. The bunches and berries are\r\nsmall, it is true; but not much more so than the Delaware; it also sets\r\nits fruit well, and as it is hardy, healthy, and a strong grower, it\r\npromises to be one of our leading wine grapes. Bunches small, but\r\ncompact, shouldered; berry small; white at the East; pale flesh-color\r\nhere; round, sweet, and without pulp; skin very thin. Requires long\r\npruning on spurs, to bring out its fruitfulness.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 25.\r\nHARTFORD PROLIFIC.--_Berries 1/2 diameter._]\r\n\r\n\r\nMARTHA.\r\n\r\nThis new grape, grown from the seed of the Concord, by that\r\nenthusiastic and warm-hearted horticulturist, SAMUEL MILLER, of\r\nLebanon, Pa., promises to be one of the greatest acquisitions to our\r\nlist of really hardy and good grapes, which have lately come before the\r\npublic. It has fruited with me the last extremely unfavorable season,\r\nand has stood the hardest test any grape could be put to, without\r\nflinching. Bunch medium, but compact and heavy, shouldered; berry pale\r\nyellow, covered with a white bloom; perhaps a trifle smaller than the\r\nConcord; round; pulpy, but sweet as honey, with only enough of the foxy\r\naroma to give it character; juicy--very good. I esteem it more highly\r\nthan any other white grape I have, as it has the healthy habit and\r\nvigorous growth of its parent, and promises to make an excellent white\r\nwine. Hangs to the bunch well, and will ripen some days before the\r\nConcord.\r\n\r\n\r\nMAXATAWNEY.\r\n\r\nAnother very promising white grape--a strong grower, and healthy; may\r\nbe somewhat too late in the east, but will, I think, be valuable at the\r\nWest and South. Bunch medium to large---not shouldered; berry above\r\nmedium; oval; pale yellow, with a slight amber tint on one side; pulp\r\ntender, sweet and sprightly; few seeds; fine aroma; quality, best.\r\nRipens about same time as Catawba; seems to be productive.\r\n\r\n\r\nROGERS' HYBRID, NO. 1.\r\n\r\nThis variety, which is also too late in ripening for the East, to be\r\nmuch esteemed there, fruited with me last season, and more than\r\nfulfilled all the expectations I entertained of it. It is the best of\r\nMr. ROGERS' Hybrids, which I have yet tasted; and its productiveness,\r\nhealthy habit, large berry, and good quality, makes it one of the most\r\ndesirable of all the grapes we raise here, for the table and market.\r\nBunch medium, loose, shouldered; berry very large, oblong, pale\r\nflesh-color; skin thin; pulp tender; few seeds, separating freely from\r\nthe pulp; sweet, vinous and juicy; quality very good. Ripens about same\r\ntime as Catawba. It is to be regretted that Mr. ROGERS has not named\r\nsome of the best of his hybrids, as the numbers give rise to many\r\nmistakes, and a great deal of confusion. It would be in the interest of\r\ngrape-growing if this was avoided, by naming at least the best of them.\r\n\r\n\r\nCREVELING, (CATAWISSA) (BLOOM).\r\n\r\nThis grape, although not quite perhaps so early as has been claimed for\r\nit--ripening about five days after Hartford Prolific--is yet of much\r\nbetter quality; and if it only should prove productive enough, will no\r\ndoubt make an excellent wine. Bunch long, loose, shouldered; berry full\r\nmedium, black, round, with little bloom; pulp tender; dark juice, sweet\r\nand very good--seems to be hardy and healthy.\r\n\r\n\r\nNORTH CAROLINA SEEDLING.\r\n\r\nBunch large, shouldered, compact; berry large, oblong, black, with blue\r\nbloom; pulpy, but sweet and good; ripens only a few days after Hartford\r\nProlific--very productive, hardy and healthy; strong grower. One of the\r\nmost showy market grapes we have--not much smaller than Union\r\nVillage--and as it ripens evenly, and is of very fair quality, is quite\r\na favorite in the market. Makes also a wine of very fair quality.\r\n\r\n\r\nCUNNINGHAM.\r\n\r\nFor the West, and very likely further South, this is a very desirable\r\ngrape for wine, of the Herbemont class. Bunch compact and heavy,\r\nsometimes shouldered; berry rather small, black, without pulp, juicy\r\nsweet and good; productive, but somewhat tender; strong grower; should\r\nbe covered in Winter; makes a very delicious wine, of the Madeira\r\nclass, which very often remains sweet for a whole year. Ripens late,\r\nabout a week after the Catawba.\r\n\r\n\r\nRULANDER.\r\n\r\nMr. FULLER evidently does not know this grape, as he says it is the\r\nsame as Logan. The Rulander we have here, is claimed to be a true\r\nforeign variety. I am inclined to think, however, that it is either a\r\nseedling from foreign seed, raised in the country, or one of the\r\nSouthern grapes of the Herbemont class. Be this as it may however, it\r\ncertainly bears no resemblance to the Logan, which is a true Fox, of\r\nthe Labrusca family. Vine a strong, vigorous, short-jointed grower,\r\nwith heart-shaped, light green, smooth leaves; very healthy, and more\r\nhardy than either the Herbemont or Cunningham. Bunch rather small, very\r\ncompact, shouldered; berry small, black, without pulp, juicy sweet and\r\ndelicious; not subject to rot or mildew: makes a delicious, high\r\nflavored wine, but not a great deal of it. The wine of this variety is\r\ncertainly one of the most delicate and valuable ones we have yet made\r\nhere and on the soil around Hermann, it will, I think, take preference\r\nover the Delaware. Ripens a few days later than Concord.\r\n\r\n\r\nLOUISIANA (BURGUNDER).\r\n\r\nIntroduced here by Mr. F. MUENCH, who received it from Mr. THEARD, of\r\nLouisiana, where it has been cultivated for some time. Some claim that\r\nit is the grape which makes the famous white Burgundy wine of Europe. I\r\nam inclined to think it is also a native, grown from foreign seed, like\r\nthe foregoing, which it closely resembles in foliage and wood; but\r\nwill, I think, make a wine of still higher quality, perhaps the most\r\ndelicate white wine we yet have. It can hardly be distinguished from\r\nthe Rulander in appearance, but has a more sprightly flavor. Ripens at\r\nthe same time.\r\n\r\n\r\nALVEY (HAGAR).\r\n\r\nThis nice little grape will certainly make one of the most delicious\r\nred wines we have, if it can only be raised in sufficient quantity. It\r\nis healthy and moderately productive, but a slow grower. Bunch loose,\r\nsmall, shouldered; berry small, black, without pulp, juicy, sweet and\r\ndelicious; quality best. Ripens about the same time as the Concord.\r\n\r\n\r\nCASSADY.\r\n\r\nBunch medium, very compact, shouldered; berry medium, round,\r\ngreenish-white, covered with white bloom; thick skin, pulpy, but very\r\nsweet, and of fine flavor; makes an excellent white wine; very\r\nproductive, but somewhat subject to leaf-blight in wet seasons; does\r\nnot rot or mildew.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 26.\r\nCONCORD.--_Berries 1/2 diameter._]\r\n\r\n\r\nBLOOD'S BLACK.\r\n\r\nHas often been confounded with Mary Ann, as both varieties were\r\ndisseminated here, by different persons, under the same name. The true\r\nBlood's Black is a few days later than Hartford Prolific; bunch heavy\r\nand compact, shouldered; berry round, black, full medium, of very fair\r\nquality, and an excellent early market grape. The vine is healthy,\r\nhardy, and enormously productive.\r\n\r\n\r\nUNION VILLAGE.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the largest native grape, of fair quality; bunch large, heavy\r\nand compact, shouldered; berry very large, oval, black, with blue\r\nbloom, pulpy, but juicy, sweet and good. Of better quality here than\r\nIsabella; tolerably free from disease, and a splendid market and table\r\nfruit. Ripens rather late.\r\n\r\n\r\nPERKINS.\r\n\r\nFor those who do not object to a good deal of foxy flavor, this will be\r\na valuable market grape, on account of its earliness, beautiful color,\r\nand great productiveness. Mr. FULLER has evidently not the true\r\nvariety, as he describes it as a \"black grape, sour and worthless.\"\r\n\r\nBunch medium, compact, shouldered; berry full medium, oval,\r\nflesh-color, with a beautiful lilac bloom; very sweet, pulpy and foxy.\r\nRipens at same time with Hartford Prolific. Vine a strong grower,\r\nhealthy and hardy.\r\n\r\n\r\nCLARA.\r\n\r\nFor family use, there is at present no grape here at the West, which is\r\nsuperior to this in quality; and although it will not pay to plant\r\nlargely, either for market or wine, yet no one who can appreciate a\r\nreally good grape, should be without a few vines of it at least.\r\n\r\nBunch long, rather loose, shouldered; berry medium, pale yellow,\r\ntranslucent, without pulp, sweet, juicy, and of excellent flavor; vine\r\nmoderately productive and healthy. Ripens with Catawba.\r\n\r\n\r\nIVES' SEEDLING, (IVES' MADEIRA).\r\n\r\nThis variety is recommended so much lately, as a superior grape for red\r\nwine, that I will mention it here, although I have not yet fruited it.\r\nIt was first introduced by Col. WARING, of Hamilton County, Ohio, and\r\nis said to be free from rot, healthy and vigorous, and to make an\r\nexcellent red wine, the must having sold from the press at $4 to $5 per\r\ngallon. The following description is from bunches sent me from Ohio\r\nlast fall:\r\n\r\nBunch medium, compact, shouldered; berry rather below medium, black,\r\noblong, juicy, sweet and well flavored; ripens about the time of the\r\nConcord. Vine vigorous and healthy; said to propagate with the greatest\r\nease; evidently belonging to the Labrusca species.\r\n\r\nWe have a seedling here of the Norton's Virginia, raised by Mr. F.\r\nLANGENDORFER, of this neighborhood, which promises to be a valuable\r\nwine grape for this location. It has not yet been named, and the owner\r\nsays will never receive a name, unless it proves, in some respect,\r\nsuperior to anything we have yet. He has fruited it twice, and made\r\nwine from it the last season, which is of a very high character,\r\nresembling Madeira, of a brownish-yellow color; splendid flavor, and of\r\ngreat body. The vine is a strong grower, healthy and very productive;\r\nbunch long, seldom shouldered, very compact; berry small, black, with\r\nblue bloom; only moderately juicy, and ripens a week later than its\r\nparent. I am inclined to think that it will be of great value here and\r\nfurther south as a wine grape, although it would ripen too late to suit\r\nthe climate further north.\r\n\r\nIt may be expected here that I should speak of the Iona, Israella, and\r\nAdirondac, as many, and good authorities too, think they will be very\r\nvaluable. The Iona and Israella have fruited but once with me, last\r\nsummer, and my experience, therefore, has not been long enough to\r\nwarrant a decided opinion. As far as it goes, however, it has been\r\ndecidedly unfavorable. My Iona vine set about twenty five bunches, but\r\nmildewed and rotted so badly, that I hardly saved as many berries. It\r\nmay improve in time, but I hardly think it will do for our soil;\r\nwhatever it may do for others--and I cannot put it down as \"promising\r\nwell.\" It is a grape of fine quality, _where it will succeed_. The\r\nIsraella stood the climate and bad weather bravely, but ripened at\r\nleast five days later than the Hartford Prolific close by, and was not\r\nas good in quality as that grape; in fact, the most insipid and\r\ntasteless grape I ever tried. They may both improve, however, upon\r\ncloser acquaintance, or be better in other locations. Here, I do not\r\nfeel warranted in praising them, and a description will hardly be\r\nneeded, as their originator has taken good care to so fully bring their\r\nmerits, real or imaginary, before the grape-growing community, that it\r\nwould be superfluous for me to describe them.\r\n\r\nThe Adirondac I saw and much admired at the East, in 1863; and if its\r\noriginator, Mr. BAILEY, had only been liberal enough to furnish me with\r\na scion of two eyes, for which I offered to pay him at the rate of a\r\ndollar per eye, I would, perhaps, be able to report about it. Instead\r\nof the scion, he sent me a dried up vine, which had no life in it when\r\nI received it, and in consequence of these disadvantages, I have not\r\nbeen able to fruit it yet. It seems to be healthy and vigorous,\r\nhowever; and should the quality of the fruit be the same as at the\r\nEast, may be a valuable acquisition.\r\n\r\nOn this list I have only mentioned those which have fruited here from\r\nfour to five years, with very few exceptions, and which have generally,\r\nduring that time, proved successful. To fully warrant the\r\nrecommendation of a grape for general cultivation I think, we should\r\nhave fruited it at least five or six years; and although there are many\r\non this list which I should not hesitate to plant largely, yet I have\r\npreferred to be rather a little over cautious than too sanguine.\r\n\r\n\r\nCLASS 3.--_Healthy varieties, but inferior in quality._\r\n\r\n\r\nMINOR SEEDLING, (VENANGO).\r\n\r\nThis grape has attracted some attention lately--some persons claiming\r\nfor it superior qualities as a _wine_ grape, even classing it with the\r\nDelaware, a statement which I cannot believe. It is a rank Fox, and I\r\ncan therefore hardly think it will make a wine to suit a fastidious\r\npalate.\r\n\r\nBunch medium, very compact, sometimes shouldered; berry full medium,\r\npale red, round, sweet, but very pulpy and foxy. Ripens later than\r\nCatawba; is very productive, vigorous and healthy--not subject to rot.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 27.\r\nCREVELING.--_Berries 1/2 diameter._]\r\n\r\n\r\nMARY ANN.\r\n\r\nThe earliest grape we have--healthy, hardy and productive--but in point\r\nof quality, a rather poor Isabella, which it much resembles.\r\n\r\nBunch full medium, moderately compact, shouldered; berry medium, oval,\r\nblack, pulpy, with a good deal of acidity, and strong flavor. Ripens\r\nabout four to five days before the Hartford Prolific, but is much\r\ninferior to that variety in quality.\r\n\r\n\r\nNORTHERN MUSCADINE.\r\n\r\nVery productive and healthy, but too foxy, and liable to drop from the\r\nbunch when ripe.\r\n\r\nBunch medium, compact, sometimes shouldered; berry round, brown, sweet,\r\nvery foxy--pulpy. Ripens about five days later than Hartford Prolific.\r\n\r\n\r\nLOGAN.\r\n\r\nRipens about same time with Hartford Prolific--but rather inferior in\r\nquality. Bunch long, loose, shouldered; berry medium, oval; resembling\r\nIsabella.\r\n\r\n\r\nBROWN.\r\n\r\nResembling Isabella, but more free from disease; good grower and\r\nproductive; will suit those who like the Isabella.\r\n\r\n\r\nHYDE'S ELIZA, (CANBY'S AUGUST).\r\n\r\nBunch medium, compact; berry medium, round, black, juicy; rather\r\npleasant, but unproductive, and of little value, where better varieties\r\ncan be had.\r\n\r\n\r\nMARION PORT.\r\n\r\nResembles the foregoing; may, perhaps, make a better wine, but cannot\r\nbe recommended.\r\n\r\n\r\nPOESCHEL'S MAMMOTH.\r\n\r\nGrown here, from seed of the Mammoth Catawba, by Mr. MICHAEL POESCHEL.\r\n\r\nBunch medium, compact, sometimes shouldered; berry very large, round,\r\npale red, pulpy; rather deficient in flavor, but very large; free from\r\ndisease. Ripens a week later than Catawba.\r\n\r\n\r\nCAPE (ALEXANDER, SCHUYLKILL MUSCADELL).\r\n\r\nBunch rather small, compact; berry medium, black, round, pulpy, rather\r\nsweet, dark juice. Said to make a good red wine, but my experience has\r\nnot been favorable. Ripens late--a week after the Catawba.\r\n\r\n\r\nDRACUT AMBER.\r\n\r\nA Fox Grape, pale red, pulpy, inferior in quality and color to Perkins,\r\nwhich it closely resembles; ripens about same time.\r\n\r\n\r\nELSINBURGH, (MISSOURI BIRD'S EYE).\r\n\r\nThis old variety was largely disseminated under the latter name, by\r\nNICHOLAS LONGWORTH, of Cincinnati. It is a nice little grape; but too\r\nunproductive to be of any value here, although it makes a very superior\r\nwine. Bunch long and loose, shouldered; berry small, round, black,\r\nmoderately juicy, with little pulp, sweet and good. Ripens a week\r\nbefore the Catawba.\r\n\r\n\r\nGARBER'S ALBINO.\r\n\r\nA grape of very fair quality, and rather early, but a shy bearer. Bunch\r\nsmall, rather loose; berry medium, pale yellow, sweet and good.\r\n\r\n\r\nFRANKLIN.\r\n\r\nA strong grower; said to be very productive; resembling Clinton in\r\nfoliage and general habit. Bunch small, compact; berry below medium,\r\nblack, juicy, with a marked frost grape flavor, and hardly worthy of\r\ncultivation.\r\n\r\n\r\nLENOIR.\r\n\r\nOf the Herbemont class, but about a week earlier; of good quality, but\r\ntoo unproductive to be recommended. Bunch medium, compact, shouldered;\r\nberry small, round, black, sweet and good.\r\n\r\n\r\nNORTH AMERICA.\r\n\r\nEarly and hardy, but too unproductive, and bunch too small. Bunch\r\nsmall, shouldered; berry round; of very good quality for its season;\r\nblack, juicy. Ripens as early as Hartford Prolific.\r\n\r\n\r\nCLASS 4.--_Varieties of good quality, but subject to disease._\r\n\r\n\r\nCATAWBA.\r\n\r\nThis well known grape was brought into notice by Major ADLUM, of\r\nGeorgetown, D.C., who thought he had, by its introduction, conferred a\r\ngreater boon upon the American people, than if he had paid the national\r\ndebt. For the last ten years, it has been so much subject to disease,\r\nthat it cannot be recommended any longer, except for some peculiar\r\nlocations. It is said to be healthy in northern Illinois and Iowa,\r\nwhere it will not stand the winter, however, without protection.\r\n\r\nBunch large, moderately compact, shouldered; berry medium, red, covered\r\nwith lilac bloom; juicy, pulpy, sweet, somewhat astringent, of good\r\nflavor. A fair grape for the table, and makes a good wine, resembling\r\nHock, but subject to mildew, rot and leaf-blight.\r\n\r\n\r\nDIANA.\r\n\r\nA seedling of the foregoing, raised by Mrs. DIANA CREHORE. Perhaps one\r\nof the most variable of all the grapes, being very fine one season, and\r\nvery indifferent the next. Bunch large and long, compact, shouldered;\r\nberry pale red, round, somewhat pulpy; thick skin; juicy and sweet,\r\nwith a peculiar flavor, which DR. WARDER very aptly calls \"feline;\"\r\nothers call it \"delicate.\" Very productive, but subject to leaf-blight,\r\nmildew and rot; although perhaps not so much as the Catawba. Ripens\r\nabout a week earlier.\r\n\r\n\r\nISABELLA.\r\n\r\nUnworthy of cultivation here, but said to be better at the North. Bunch\r\nlong, loose, shouldered; berry medium, oval, black; tough pulp, with a\r\ngood deal of acidity, juicy, and a peculiar flavor. Ripens irregularly.\r\nSubject to rot and leaf-blight.\r\n\r\n\r\nGARRIGUES.\r\n\r\nClosely resembling the Isabella, but ripens more evenly, and is of\r\nsomewhat better quality.\r\n\r\n\r\nTOKALON.\r\n\r\nBunch large, loose, shouldered; berry black, large, sweet and buttery;\r\nof very good quality, but very much subject to disease. Ripens somewhat\r\nlater than Catawba.\r\n\r\n\r\nANNA.\r\n\r\nBunch large and loose; berry pale amber, covered with white bloom;\r\nsweet, tolerable flavor, but poor bearer, and subject to mildew. Ripens\r\nabout same time as Catawba.\r\n\r\n\r\nALLEN'S HYBRID, (ALLEN'S WHITE HYBRID).\r\n\r\nBunch large and loose, shouldered; berry medium, nearly round; white,\r\nwithout pulp, juicy and delicious; quality very good, but variable;\r\nsometimes best. Said to be a hybrid of Vitis Labrusca and a foreign\r\ngrape, raised by J. F. ALLEN, Salem, Massachusetts, and is really a\r\nfine grape, although too tender and variable for extensive vineyard\r\nculture. Ripens about two weeks before Catawba.\r\n\r\n\r\nCUYAHOGA (COLEMAN'S WHITE).\r\n\r\nMuch recommended in Ohio, where it originated, but unworthy of culture\r\nhere, being a poor grower, a shy bearer and very much subject to\r\nleaf-blight. Bunch medium, compact; berry dirty greenish-white; thick\r\nskin; pulpy, and insipid.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEVEREAUX.\r\n\r\nThis is, in dry seasons, a really fine grape, but subject to\r\nleaf-blight and mildew in hot seasons. Bunch often a foot long, loose,\r\nshouldered; berry below medium, round, black, juicy; without pulp,\r\nsweet and vinous. Belonging to the Herbemont family; is a strong\r\ngrower; very productive, and rather tender. May be valuable in well\r\ndrained soils, and southern climate, as it undoubtedly will make a fine\r\nwine.\r\n\r\n\r\nKINGSESSING.\r\n\r\nBunch long and loose, large, shouldered; berry medium, round, pale red,\r\nwith fine lilac bloom; pulpy; of fair quality, but subject to\r\nleaf-blight, and mildew.\r\n\r\n\r\nROGERS' HYBRID, NO. 15.\r\n\r\nBunch large, loose, shouldered; berry above medium, red with blue\r\nbloom, roundish-oblong, pulpy, with peculiar flavor, sweet and juicy. A\r\nshowy grape, but not very good in quality, and much subject to mildew\r\nand rot. Ripens at the same time with Catawba.\r\n\r\n\r\nCLASS 5.--_Varieties unworthy of cultivation._\r\n\r\n\r\nOPORTO.\r\n\r\nOf all the humbugs ever perpetrated upon the grape-growing public, this\r\nis one of the most glaring. The vine, although a rank and healthy\r\ngrower, is unproductive; seldom setting more than half a dozen berries\r\non a bunch, and these are so sour, have such a hard pulp, with such a\r\ndecided frost-grape taste and flavor, and are so deficient in juice,\r\nthat no sensible man should think of making them into wine, much less\r\ncall it, as its disseminator did, \"the true port wine grape.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nMASSACHUSETTS WHITE.\r\n\r\nThis was sent me some eight years ago, by B. M. WATSON, as \"the best\r\nand hardiest white grape in cultivation,\" and he charged me the\r\nmoderate sum of $5 each, for small pot plants, with hardly two eyes of\r\nripened wood. After careful nursing of three years, I had the pleasure\r\nof seeing my labors rewarded by a moderate crop of the vilest _red_ Fox\r\nGrapes it has ever been my ill luck to try.\r\n\r\nThe foregoing have all been tried by me, and have been characterized\r\nand classified as I have found them _here_. The following are varieties\r\nI have not fruited yet, although I have them on trial.\r\n\r\nVarieties highly recommended by good authorities: Telegraph, Black\r\nHawk, Rogers' Hybrids, Nos. 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 13, 19, 22, 33, Hettie,\r\nLydia, Charlotte, Mottled, Pauline, Wilmington, Cotaction and Miles.\r\n\r\nThere are innumerable other varieties, for which their originators all\r\nclaim peculiar merits, and some of whom may prove valuable. But all who\r\nbring new varieties before the public, should consider that we have\r\nalready names enough, nay, more than are good for us, and that it is\r\nuseless to swell the list still more, unless we can do so with a\r\nvariety, superior in some respects to our best varieties. A new grape,\r\nto claim favor at the hands of the public, should be healthy, hardy, a\r\ngood grower, and productive; and of superior quality, either for the\r\ntable or for wine.\r\n\r\nThere are some varieties circulated throughout the country as natives,\r\nwhich are really nothing but foreign varieties, or, perhaps, raised\r\nfrom foreign seed. They will not succeed in open air, although now and\r\nthen they will ripen a bunch. The Brinkle, Canadian Chief, Child's\r\nSuperb, and El Paso belong to this class.\r\n\r\nA really good _table_ grape should have a large amount of sugar, but\r\ntempered and made more agreeable by a due proportion of acid, as, if\r\nthe acid is wanting, it will taste insipid; a tender pulp, agreeable\r\nflavor, a large amount of juice, a good sized bunch, large berry, small\r\nseeds, thin skin, and hang well to the bunch.\r\n\r\nA good _wine_ grape should have a large amount of sugar, with the acid\r\nin due proportion, a distinctive flavor or aroma; though not so strong\r\nas to become disagreeable, and for red wines a certain amount of\r\nastringency. It is an old vintner's rule, that the varieties with small\r\nberries will generally make the best wine, as they are generally richer\r\nin sugar, and have more character than varieties with larger berries.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 28.\r\nCLARA.--_Berries 1/2 diameter._]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWINE-MAKING.\r\n\r\n\r\nGATHERING THE GRAPES.\r\n\r\nAlthough I have described the process already, I will here again\r\nreiterate that the grapes should be thoroughly _ripe_. This does not\r\nsimply mean that they are well colored. The Concord generally begins to\r\ncolor here the 5th of August, and we could gather the majority of our\r\ngrapes, of that variety, for market, by the 15th or 20th of that month;\r\nbut for wine-making we allow them to hang until the 15th or 20th of\r\nSeptember, and sometimes into October. Thus only do we get the full\r\namount of sugar and delicacy of aroma which that grape is capable of\r\ndeveloping, as the water evaporates, and the sugar remains; it also\r\nloses nearly all the acidity from its pulp; and the latter, which is so\r\ntough and hard immediately after coloring, nearly all dissolves and\r\nbecomes tender. The best evidences of a grape being thoroughly ripe\r\nare: 1st. The stem turns brown, and begins to shrivel; 2nd, the berry\r\nbegins to shrivel around the stem; 3d, thin and transparent skin; 4th,\r\nthe juice becomes very sweet, and sticks to the finger like honey or\r\nmolasses, after handling the grapes for some time.\r\n\r\nIt is often the case that some bunches ripen much later on the vines.\r\nIn such a case, the ripest should be gathered first, and those that are\r\nnot fully ripe remain on the vines until mature. They will ripen much\r\nquicker if the ripest bunches have been removed first.\r\n\r\nThe first implements needed for the gathering are clean wooden and tin\r\npails and sharp knives, or better still, the small shears spoken of in\r\na former part of this work. Each gatherer is provided with a pail, or\r\ntwo may go together, having a pail each, so that one can empty and the\r\nother keep filling during the time. If there are a good many unripe\r\nberries on the bunches, they may be put into a separate pail, and all\r\nthat are soft will give an inferior wine. The bunch is cut with as\r\nshort a stem as possible, as the stem contains a great deal of acid and\r\nastringency; every unripe or decayed berry is picked out, so that\r\nnothing but perfectly sound, ripe berries remain.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 29.]\r\n\r\nThe next implement that we need is a wooden tub or vat, to carry the\r\ngrapes to the mill; or the wagon, if the vineyard is any distance from\r\nthe cellar. This is made of thin boards, half-inch pine lumber\r\ngenerally; 3 feet high inside, 10 inches wide at the bottom, 20 inches\r\nwide at the top, being flat on one side, where it is carried on the\r\nback, and bound with thin iron hoops. It is carried by two\r\nleather-straps running over the shoulders, as shown in Fig. 29, and\r\nshould contain about eight to ten pails, or a little over two bushels\r\nof grapes. The carrier can pass easily through the rows with it to any\r\npart of the vineyard, and lean it against a post until full. If the\r\nvineyard is close to the cellar or press-house, the grapes can be\r\ncarried to it directly; if too far, we must provide a long tub or vat,\r\nto place on the wagon, into which the grapes are emptied. I will here\r\nagain repeat that the utmost cleanliness should be observed in _all_\r\nthe apparatus; and no tub or vat should be used that is in the least\r\ndegree mouldy. Everything should be perfectly sweet and clean, and a\r\nstrict supervision kept up, that the laborers do not drop any crumbs of\r\nbread, &c., among the grapes, as this will immediately cause acetous\r\nfermentation. The weather should be dry and fair, and the grapes dry\r\nwhen gathered.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE WINE-CELLAR.\r\n\r\nAs the wine-cellar and press-house are generally built together, I will\r\nalso describe them together. A good cellar should keep about an even\r\ntemperature in cold and warm weather, and should, therefore, be built\r\nsufficiently deep, arched over with stone, well ventilated, and kept\r\ndry. Where the ground is hilly, a northern or northwestern slope should\r\nbe chosen, as it is a great convenience, if the entrance can be made\r\neven with the ground. Its size depends, of course, upon the quantity of\r\nwine to be stored. I will here give the dimensions of one I am\r\nconstructing at present, and which is calculated to store from 15,000\r\nto 20,000 gallons of wine. The principal cellar will be 100 feet long,\r\nby 18-1/2 feet wide inside, and 12 feet high under the middle of the\r\narch. This will be divided into two compartments; the back one, at the\r\nfarthest end of the cellar, to be 40 feet, which is destined to keep\r\nold wine of former vintages; as it is the deepest below the ground, it\r\nwill keep the coolest temperature. It is divided from the front\r\ncompartment by a wall and doors, so that it can be shut off should it\r\nbecome necessary to heat the other, while the must is fermenting. The\r\nother compartment will be 60 feet long, and is intended for the new\r\nwine, as the temperature will be somewhat higher, and, therefore,\r\nbetter adapted to the fermentation of the must. This will be provided\r\nwith a stove, so that the air can be warmed, if necessary, during\r\nfermentation. This will also be closed by folding doors, 5-1/2 feet\r\nwide. There will be about six ventilators, or air-flues, on each side\r\nof these two cellars, built in the wall, constructed somewhat like\r\nchimneys, commencing at the bottom, whose upper terminus is about two\r\nfeet above the arch, and closed with a grate and trap-doors, so that\r\nthey can be closed and opened at will, to admit air and light. Before\r\nthis principal cellar is an arched entrance, twenty feet long inside,\r\nalso closed by folding doors, and as wide as the principal cellar. This\r\nwill be very convenient to store empty casks, and can also be used as a\r\nfermenting room in Fall, should it be needed. The arch of the principal\r\ncellar will be covered with about six feet of earth; the walls of the\r\ncellar to be two feet thick. The press-house will be built above the\r\ncellar, over its entire length, and will also be divided into two\r\nrooms. The part farthest from the entrance of the cellar, to be 60 feet\r\nby 18, will be the press-house proper, with folding doors on both\r\nsides, about the middle of the building, and even with the surface\r\nground, so that a wagon can pass in on one side and out on the other.\r\nThis will contain the grape-mill, wine-presses, apparatus for stemming,\r\nand fermenting vats for white or light-colored wine. The other part, 40\r\nfeet long, will contain an apparatus for distilling, the casks and vats\r\nto store the husks for distilling, and the vats to ferment very dark\r\ncolored wines on the husks, should it be necessary. It will also be\r\nused as a shop, contain a stove, and be floored, so that it will be\r\nconvenient, in wet and cold weather, to cut cuttings, &c. A large\r\ncistern, to be built on one side of the building, so that the necessary\r\nwater for cleaning casks, &c., will be handy; with a force-pump, will\r\ncomplete the arrangement. I need hardly add here, that the whole cellar\r\nshould be paved with flags or brick, and well drained, so that it will\r\nbe perfectly dry.\r\n\r\nThis cellar is destined to hold two rows of casks, five feet long, on\r\neach side. For this purpose layers of strong beams are provided, upon\r\nwhich the casks are laid in such a manner that they are about two feet\r\nfrom the ground, fronting to the middle, and at least a foot or\r\neighteen inches of space allowed between them and the wall, so that a\r\nman can conveniently pass and examine them. This will leave five and\r\na-half to six feet of space between the two rows, to draw off the wine,\r\nmove casks, _&c_.\r\n\r\nThis cellar will, at the present rates of work, cost about $6,000. Of\r\ncourse, the cellar, as before remarked, can be built according to the\r\nwants of the grape-grower. For merely keeping wine during the first\r\nwinter, a common house cellar will do; but during the hot days of\r\nsummer wine will not keep well in it.\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPARATUS FOR WINE-MAKING.--THE GRAPE MILL AND PRESS.\r\n\r\nThis mill can be made very simple, of two wooden rollers, fastened in a\r\nsquare frame, running against each other, and turned with a crank and\r\ncog-wheel. The rollers should be about nine inches in diameter, and set\r\nfar enough apart to mash the berries, but not the seeds and stems. A\r\nvery convenient apparatus, mill and press, is manufactured by Geiss &\r\nBrosius, Belleville, Ill., and where the quantity to be made does not\r\nexceed 2,000 gallons, it will answer every purpose. The mill has stone\r\nrollers, which can be set by screws to the proper distance, with a\r\ncutting apparatus on top, for apples in making cider, which can be\r\ntaken off at will. The press is by itself, and consists of an iron\r\nscrew, coming up through the platform, with a zinc tube around it to\r\nprevent the must from coming in contact with it. The platform has a\r\ndouble bottom, the lower one with grooves; the upper consists simply of\r\nboards, with grooves through it to allow the must to run through. These\r\nboards are held in their places by wooden pegs, and can be taken off at\r\nwill. A circular hopper, about a foot in diameter, and made of laths\r\nscrewed to iron rings, with about a quarter of an inch space between\r\nthem, encloses the zinc tube. The outer frame is constructed in the\r\nsame way, is about 2-1/2 feet in diameter, and bound with strong wooden\r\nand iron hoops. The mashed grapes are poured into the frame, a\r\nclose-fitting cover is put on, which is held down by a strong block,\r\nand the power is applied by an iron nut just on the top of the screw,\r\nwith holes in each end to apply strong wooden levers. The apparatus is\r\nstrong, simple, and convenient, and presses remarkably fast and clean,\r\nas the must can run off below, on the outside and also on the inside.\r\nThe cost of mill and press is about $90, but each can be had separately\r\nfor $45.\r\n\r\nIf a large amount of grapes are to be pressed, the press should be of\r\nmuch larger dimensions, but may be constructed on the same principle--a\r\nstrong, large platform, with a strong screw coming through the middle,\r\nand a frame made of laths, screwed to a strong wooden frame, through\r\nwhich the must can run off freely, with another frame around the\r\noutside of the platform. The must runs off through grooves to the lower\r\nside, where it is let off by a spout. It may be large enough to contain\r\na hundred bushels of grapes at a single pressing, for a great deal\r\ndepends upon the ability of the vintner to press a large amount just at\r\nthe proper time, when the must has fermented on the husks just as long\r\nas he desires it to do.\r\n\r\n\r\nFERMENTING VATS.\r\n\r\nThese should correspond somewhat with the size of the casks we intend\r\nto fill; but they are somewhat unhandy if they hold more than, say four\r\nhundred gallons. They are made of oak or white pine boards, 1-1/2 inch\r\nthick, bound securely by iron hoops, about three feet high, and, say,\r\nfive feet wide. The bottom and inside must be worked clean and smooth,\r\nto facilitate washing. When the must is to ferment a longer time on the\r\nhusks, as is often the case in red wines, a false bottom should be\r\nprovided, for the purpose of holding the husks down below the surface\r\nof the must. It is made to fit the size of the vat, and perforated with\r\nholes, and held in its place by sticks of two inches square, let into\r\nthe bottom of the vat, and which go through the false bottom. A hole is\r\nbored through them, and the bottom held down by means of a peg passed\r\nthrough this hole. The vat is closed by a tight-fitting cover, through\r\nwhich a hole is bored, large enough to admit a tin tube of about an\r\ninch in diameter, to let off the gas. The vats are set high enough\r\nabove the ground to admit drawing off the must through a faucet near\r\nthe bottom of the vat. For those grapes which are to be pressed\r\nimmediately we need no false bottoms or covers for the vats. As\r\nfermentation generally progresses very rapidly here, and it is not\r\ndesirable with most of our wines to ferment them on the husks very\r\nlong, as they generally have astringency enough, operations here are\r\nmuch more simple than in Europe.\r\n\r\nThe must is generally allowed to run into a large funnel, filled with\r\noat straw, and passes through a hose into the casks in the cellar. A\r\nhole can be left through the arch for that purpose, as it is much more\r\nconvenient than to carry the must in buckets from the press into the\r\ncasks.\r\n\r\nIt is sometimes desirable to stem the grapes, although it is seldom\r\npracticed in this country. This can be easily done by passing the\r\nbunches rapidly over a grooved board, made somewhat in the form of a\r\ncommon washboard, only the grooves should be round at the bottom and\r\nthe edges on top. It is seldom desirable here.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE WINE CASKS.\r\n\r\nThese should be made of well-seasoned white oak staves, and can, of\r\ncourse, be of various sizes to meet the wants of the vintner. The best\r\nand most convenient size for cellar use I have found to be about 500\r\ngallons. These are sufficiently large to develop the wine fully, and\r\nyet can be filled quick enough to not interrupt fermentation. Of\r\ncourse, the vintner must have some of all sizes, even down to the\r\nfive-gallon keg; but for keeping wine, a cask of 500 gallons takes less\r\nroom comparatively, and the wine will attain a higher degree of\r\nperfection than in smaller casks. The staves to make such a cask should\r\nbe about 5 feet long, and 1-1/2 to 2 inches thick, and be the very best\r\nwood to be had. The cask will, when ready, be about as high as it is\r\nlong, should be carefully worked and planed inside, to facilitate\r\nwashing and have a so-called door on one end, 12 inches wide and 18\r\ninches high, which is fastened by means of an iron bolt and screw, and\r\na strong bar of wood. This is to facilitate cleaning; when a cask is\r\nempty, the door is taken out, and a man slips into the cask with a\r\nbroom and brush, and carefully washes off all remnants of lees, etc.,\r\nwhich, as the lees of the wine are very slimy and tenacious, cannot be\r\nremoved by merely pouring in water and shaking it about. It is also\r\nmuch more convenient to let these large casks remain in their places,\r\nthan to move them about. The casks are bound with strong iron hoops.\r\n\r\nTo prepare the new casks, and also the vats, etc., for the reception of\r\nthe must, they should be either filled with pure water, and allowed to\r\nsoak for several days, to draw out the tannin; then emptied, scalded\r\nwith hot water, and afterwards steamed with, say two or three gallons\r\nof boiling wine; or they can be made \"wine-green,\" by putting in about\r\nhalf a bushel of unslaked lime, and pouring in about the same quantity\r\nof hot water. After the lime has fallen apart, add about two quarts of\r\nwater to each pound of lime, put in the bung, and turn the cask about;\r\nleaving it lie sometimes on one side, sometimes on the other, so that\r\nthe lime will come in contact with every part of the cask. Then pour\r\nout the lime-water; wash once or twice with warm water, and rinse with\r\na decoction of vine leaves, or with warm wine. Then rinse once more\r\nwith cold water, and it will be fully prepared to receive the must.\r\nThis is also to be observed with old casks, which have become, by\r\nneglect or otherwise, mouldy, or have a peculiar tang.\r\n\r\n\r\nMAKING THE WINE.\r\n\r\nAs we have our apparatus all prepared now, we can commence the\r\noperation itself. This can be done in different ways, according to the\r\nclass of wine we are about to make.\r\n\r\nTo make white, or light-colored wine, the grapes which were gathered\r\nand mashed during the day, can be pressed and put into the cask the\r\nfollowing night. To mash them, we place the mill above one of the\r\nfermenting vats, mashing them as quick as they are carried or hauled to\r\nthe press-house. The vat is simply covered with a cloth during the day.\r\nIf the season has been good, the must will make good wine without the\r\naddition of anything else. In poor seasons it will be necessary to add\r\nwater and sugar, to improve its quality, but I will speak of this\r\nmethod in a separate chapter. In the evening, the must which will run\r\noff, is first drawn from the vat, and by some kept separate; but I\r\nthink, it makes, upon the whole, a better wine, if the pressing is\r\nadded to it. The husks, or mashed grapes, are then poured upon the\r\npress, and pressed until fully dry. To accomplish this the press is\r\nopened several times, and the edges of the cake, or \"cheese,\" as some\r\ncall it, are cut off with an axe or cleaver and put on top, after which\r\nthey are pressed down again. The casks are then filled with the must;\r\neither completely, if it is intended that the must should ferment\r\n_above_, as it is called, or _under_, when the cask is not completely\r\nfilled, so that the husks, which the must will throw up, will remain in\r\nthe cask. Both methods have their advantages, but I prefer the former,\r\nwith a very simple contrivance, to exclude the air, and also prevent\r\nwaste. This is a siphon or tin tube, bent in the form of a double\r\nelbow, of which one end fits tightly in the bung hole, and the other\r\nempties into a dish of water, to be set on one end of the cask, through\r\nwhich the gas escapes, as shown in Fig. 30.\r\n\r\nWe should, however in pressing, be guided somewhat by the weather. In\r\nwarm weather fermentation will commence much sooner, and be more\r\nviolent, than when the weather is cold. Consequently we should press\r\nmuch sooner in warm weather, than when the air is cool. Late in the\r\nfall, it is sometimes advisable to leave the must a day longer on the\r\nhusks, than indicated below. The cellar should be kept at an even\r\ntemperature of about 60° during the first few weeks, and if it does not\r\nnaturally attain this temperature, then it should be warmed by a stove,\r\nas much of the quality of the wine depends upon a thorough fermentation\r\nduring the first ten days.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 30.]\r\n\r\nWhen violent fermentation has ceased, say after about ten or twelve\r\ndays, and the must has become quiet, the cask should be closed with a\r\ntight bung, and the wine is left until it is clear. In about two to\r\nthree months it ought to be perfectly clear and fine--is then racked,\r\n_i.e._, drawn from the lees, by means of a faucet, and put into clean,\r\nsweet casks. It is very important that the casks are \"wine-seasoned,\"\r\nthat is, have no other tang than of wine. For must, fresh brandy or\r\nwhiskey casks may be used, but after the wine has fermented, it will\r\nnot do to use such, as the wine will acquire the smell and taste of the\r\nliquor. When a cask has been emptied, it should be carefully cleaned,\r\nas before described, by entering at the door, or with smaller casks, by\r\ntaking out the head. After it is thoroughly cleansed, it may be\r\nfumigated slightly, by burning a small piece of sulphured paper, or a\r\nnutmeg in it, and then filled. To keep empty casks in good condition\r\nthey should, after cleaning, be allowed to become thoroughly dry, when\r\nthey are sulphured, closed tightly, and laid away in the cellar. The\r\noperation of sulphuring should be repeated every six weeks. If wanted\r\nfor use, they are simply rinsed with cold water.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 31.]\r\n\r\nFor racking the wine, we should have: 1st a large brass faucet. 2d.\r\nPails of a peculiar shape, wider at the top, to prevent wastage. 3d. A\r\nwooden funnel, as shown in Fig. 31, to hold about six gallons. In\r\nracking--first carefully lift the bung of the cask, as the exclusion of\r\nair from above would cause a gurgling motion in the cask, if tapped\r\nbelow, which would stir up the lees in the bottom. Then, after having\r\nloosened with a hammer the wooden peg, closing the tap hole, let your\r\nassistant hold the pail opposite the hole, hold the faucet in your\r\nright hand, and with the left, withdraw the plug, inserting the faucet\r\nquickly. Drive it in firmly with a hammer, and you are ready for the\r\nwork.\r\n\r\nDo not fully open the faucet at first, because the first pailful is\r\ngenerally not quite clear, and should run slowly. You can keep this by\r\nitself; and this, and the last from the lees, is generally put into a\r\ncask together and allowed to settle again. It will make a good, clear\r\nwine after a few weeks. As soon as the wine runs quite clear and\r\nlimpid, it can be put into the cask destined to receive it, and you can\r\nlet it run as fast as it can be emptied. When the wine has run off down\r\nto the tap hole, the cask may be carefully raised on the other end, one\r\ninserting a brick or piece of board under it, while the other lifts\r\ngently and slowly. This may be repeated several times, as long as the\r\nwine runs clear; and even the somewhat cloudy wine may be put with the\r\nfirst pailful into a separate cask. As soon as it comes thick or muddy,\r\nit is time to stop. The lees are emptied out, and will, if distilled,\r\nmake a fine flavored and very strong brandy.\r\n\r\nThis treatment can be applied to all white and light-colored wines,\r\nwhen it is not desirable to have a certain astringency in the wine. The\r\nCatawba, Concord, Herbemont, Delaware, Rulander, Cassady, Taylor,\r\nLouisiana, Hartford Prolific, and Cunningham should all be treated in a\r\nsimilar manner. The Concord, although it will, under this treatment,\r\nmake only a light red wine, of which the color can be changed to dark\r\nred by fermenting on the husks, is not desirable if treated in the\r\nlatter manner; as the peculiar foxy aroma of the grape will be imparted\r\nto the must to such a degree, as to make the flavor disagreeable, I\r\nshall recur to the subject of flavor in wines in another chapter.\r\n\r\nTo make red wine, the must should be fermented on the husks, as\r\ngenerally the darkest color is desired, and also, a certain\r\nastringency, which the wine will acquire principally from the seeds,\r\nskins, and stems of the grapes, which contain the tannin. The grapes\r\nare mashed, and put into the fermenting vat, of the kind described\r\nbefore, with false bottoms. After the vat is filled about three-fourths\r\nthe false bottom is put on, the husks are pressed down by it, until\r\nthey are covered about six inches by the must, and the cover put on. It\r\nis seldom desirable here to ferment longer than three days on the\r\nhusks, if the weather is warm--in a temperature of 60°--two days will\r\noften be enough, as the wine will become too rough and astringent by an\r\nexcessively long fermentation. Only experience will be the proper guide\r\nhere, and also the individual taste. It will be generally time to\r\npress, when the must has changed its sweet taste, and acquired a\r\nsomewhat rough and bitter one. Where it is desired to make a very dark\r\ncolored wine, without too much astringency, the grapes should be\r\nstemmed, as most of the rough and bitter taste is in the stems; and it\r\ncan then be fermented on the husks for six or eight days. In this\r\nmanner the celebrated Burgundy wines are made; also most of the red\r\nwines of France and Germany. Many of them are even allowed to go\r\nthrough the whole process of fermentation, and the husks are filled\r\ninto the cask with the must, through a door, made in the upper side of\r\nthe cask; and it there remains, until the clear wine is drawn off. This\r\nis seldom desirable here, however, as our red wine grapes have\r\nsufficient astringency and color without this process. The treatment\r\nduring fermentation, racking, etc., is precisely the same as with white\r\nwine, with only this difference, that the red wine is generally allowed\r\nto stay longer on the lees; for our object in making this class of wine\r\nis different than in making white, or so-called Schiller or light red\r\nwine. In white and light colored wines we desire smoothness and\r\ndelicacy of bouquet and taste; in dark red wines, we desire astringency\r\nand body, as they are to be the so-called stomach or medical wines. It\r\nis therefore generally racked but once, in the latter part of February\r\nor March, and the white and light colored wines are racked in December\r\nor January, as soon as they have become clear--and again in March. We\r\nalso use no sulphur in fumigating the casks, as it takes away the color\r\nto a certain extent. We generally do not use anything, but simply clean\r\nthe casks well, in racking red wine.\r\n\r\nI will say a few words in regard to _under_ fermentation. If this\r\nmethod is to be followed, the casks are not filled, but enough space\r\nleft to allow the wine to ferment, without throwing out lees and husks\r\nat the bung. The bung is then covered, by laying a sack filled with\r\nsand over it, and when fermentation is over--as well by this as by the\r\nother method--the casks are filled with must or wine, kept in a\r\nseparate cask for the purpose. The casks should always be kept well\r\nfilled, and must be looked over and filled every two or three weeks, as\r\nthe wine will continually lose in quantity, by evaporation through the\r\nwood of the casks. The casks should be varnished or brushed over with\r\nlinseed oil, as this will prevent evaporation to some extent.\r\n\r\nIn wine making, and giving the wine its character, we can only be\r\nguided by practice and individual taste, as well as the prevailing\r\ntaste of the consuming public. If the prevailing taste is for light\r\ncolored, smooth and delicate wines, we can make them so, by pressing\r\nimmediately, and racking soon, and frequently. If a dark colored,\r\nastringent wine is desired, we can ferment on the husks, and leave it\r\non the lees a longer period. There is a medium course, in this as in\r\neverything else; and the intelligent vintner will soon find the rules\r\nwhich should guide him, by practice with different varieties.\r\n\r\nAmong the wines to be treated as dark red, I will name Norton's\r\nVirginia, Cynthiana, Arkansas, and Clinton, and, I suppose, Ives'\r\nSeedling. It would be insulting to these noble wines to class with them\r\nthe Oporto, which may make a very dark colored liquid, but no _wine_\r\nworth the name, unless an immense quantity of sugar is added, and\r\nenough of water to dilute the peculiar vile aroma of that grape.\r\n\r\n\r\nAFTER TREATMENT OF THE WINE.\r\n\r\nEven if the wine was perfectly fine and clear, when drawn off, it will\r\ngo through a second fermentation as soon as warm weather sets it--say\r\nin May or June. If the wine is clear and fine, however, the\r\nfermentation will be less violent, than if it is not so clear, as the\r\nlees, which the wine has never entirely deposited; act as they ferment.\r\nIt is not safe or judicious, therefore, to bottle the wine _before_\r\nthis second fermentation is over. As soon as the wine has become\r\nperfectly clear and fine again--generally in August or September--it\r\ncan be bottled. For bottling wine we need: 1st. clean bottles. 2d. good\r\ncorks, which must first be scalded with hot water, to soften them, and\r\ndraw out all impurities, and then soaked in cold water. 3d. a small\r\nfunnel. 4th. a small faucet. 5th. a cork-press, of iron or wood. 6th. a\r\nlight wooden mallet to drive in the corks.\r\n\r\nAfter the faucet has been inserted in the cask, fill your bottles so\r\nthat there will be about an inch of room between the cork and the wine.\r\nLet them stand about five minutes before you drive in the cork, which\r\nshould always be of rather full size, and made to fit by compressing it\r\nwith the press at one end. Then drive in the cork with the mallet, and\r\nlay the bottles, either in sand on the cellar floor, or on a rack made\r\nfor that purpose. They should be laid so that the wine covers the cork,\r\nto exclude all air.\r\n\r\nThe greater bulk of the wine, however, if yet on hand; can be kept in\r\ncasks. All the wine to be kept thus, should be racked once in about six\r\nmonths, and the casks kept well filled. Most of our native wines,\r\nhowever, are generally sold after the second racking in March, and a\r\ngreat many even as soon as clear--in January.\r\n\r\n\r\nDISEASES OF THE WINE AND THEIR REMEDIES.\r\n\r\nThese will seldom occur, if the wine has been properly treated. Cases\r\nmay arise, however, when it will become necessary to rack the wine, or\r\nfine it by artificial means.\r\n\r\n\r\nTREATMENT OF FLAT AND TURBID WINE.\r\n\r\nThe cause of this is generally a want of Tannin. If the wine has a\r\npeculiar, flat, soft taste, and looks cloudy, this is generally the\r\ncase. Draw the wine into another cask, which has been well sulphured,\r\nand add some pulverized tannin, which can be had in every drug store.\r\nThe tannin may be dissolved in water--about an ounce to every two\r\nhundred gallons of wine--and the wine well stirred, by inserting a\r\nstick at the bung. Should it not have become clear after about three\r\nweeks, it should be fined. This can be done, by adding about an ounce\r\nof powdered gum-arabic to each forty gallons, and stirring the wine\r\nwell when it has been poured in. Or, take some wine out of the\r\ncasks--add to each forty gallons which it contains the whites of ten\r\neggs, whipped to foam with the wine taken out--pour in the mixture\r\nagain--stir up well, and bung up tight. After a week the wine will\r\ngenerally be clear, and should then be drawn off.\r\n\r\n\r\nUSE OF THE HUSKS AND LEES.\r\n\r\nThese should be distilled, and will make a very strong, fine flavored\r\nbrandy. The husks are put into empty barrels or vats--stamped down\r\nclose, and a cover of clay made over them, to exclude the air. They\r\nwill thus undergo a fermentation, and be ready for distillation in\r\nabout a month. They should be taken fresh from the press, however; for\r\nif they come into contact with the air, they will soon become sour and\r\nmouldy. The lees can be distilled immediately. Good fresh lees, from\r\nrather astringent wines are also an excellent remedy when the wine\r\nbecomes flat, as before described.\r\n\r\n\r\nDR. GALL'S AND PETIOL'S METHOD OF WINE MAKING.\r\n\r\nThe process of wine making before described, however, can only be\r\napplied in such seasons, and with such varieties of grapes, that\r\ncontain all the necessary elements for a good wine in due proportion.\r\nFor unfavorable seasons, with such varieties of grapes as are deficient\r\nin some of the principal ingredients, we must take a different\r\ncourse--follow a different method. To see our way clearly before us in\r\nthis, let us first examine which are the constituent parts of must or\r\ngrape juice. A chemical analysis of must, shows the following result:\r\n\r\nGrape juice contains sugar, water, free acids, tannin, gummy and mucous\r\nsubstances, coloring matter, fragrant or flavoring substances, (aroma\r\nbouquet). A good wine should contain all these ingredients in due\r\nproportion. If there is an excess of one, and a want of the other, the\r\nwine will lose in quality. Must, which contains all of these, in due\r\nproportion, we call _normal_ must, and only by determining the amount\r\nof sugar and acids in this so-called normal must, can we gain the\r\nknowledge how to improve such must, which does not contain the\r\nnecessary proportion of each. The frequent occurrence of unfavorable\r\nseasons in Europe, when the grapes did not ripen fully, and were sadly\r\ndeficient in sugar, set intelligent men to thinking how this defect\r\ncould be remedied; and a grape crop, which was almost worthless, from\r\nits want of sugar, and its excess of acids, could be made to yield at\r\nleast a fair article, instead of the sour and unsaleable article\r\ngenerally produced in such seasons. Among the foremost who experimented\r\nwith this object in view I will here name CHAPTAL, PETIOL; but\r\nespecially DR. LUDWIG GALL, who has at last reduced the whole science\r\nof wine-making to such a mathematical certainty, that we stand amazed\r\nonly, that so simple a process should not have been discovered long\r\nago. It is the old story of the egg of Columbus; but the poor vintners\r\nof Germany, and France, and we here, are none the less deeply indebted\r\nto those intelligent and persevering men for the incalculable benefits\r\nthey have conferred upon us. The production of good wine is thus\r\nreduced to a mathematical certainty; although we cannot in a bad\r\nseason, produce as high flavored and delicate wines, as in the best\r\nyears, we can now always make a fair article, by following the simple\r\nrules laid down by DR. GALL. When this method was first introduced, it\r\nwas calumniated and despised--called adulteration of wine, and even\r\nprohibited by the governments of Europe; but, DR. GALL fearlessly\r\nchallenged his opponents to have his wines analyzed by the most eminent\r\nchemists; which was repeatedly done, and the results showed that they\r\ncontained nothing but such ingredients which pure wine should contain;\r\nand since men like VON BABO, DOBEREINER and others have openly endorsed\r\nand recommended gallizing, prejudice is giving way before the light of\r\nscientific knowledge.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 32.]\r\n\r\nBut to determine the amount of sugar and acids contained in the must we\r\nneed a few necessary implements. These are:\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MUST SCALE OR SACCHAROMETER.\r\n\r\nThe most suitable one now in use is the _Oechsle's_ must scale,\r\nconstructed on the principle that the instrument sinks the deeper into\r\nany fluid, the thinner it is, or the less sugar it contains. Fig. 32\r\nshows this instrument, \"which is generally made of silver, or German\r\nsilver, although they are also made of glass. A, represents a hollow\r\ncylinder--best made of glass, filled with must to the brim, into which\r\nplace the must scale B. It is composed of the hollow float _a_, which\r\nkeeps it suspended in the fluid; of the weight _c_, for holding in a\r\nperpendicular position; and of the scale _e_ divided by small lines\r\ninto from fifty to one hundred degrees. Before the gauge is placed in\r\nthe must, draw it several times through the mouth, to moisten it--but\r\nallow no saliva to adhere to it. When the guage ceases to descend, note\r\nthe degree to which it has sunk; after which press it down with the\r\nfinger a few degrees further, and on its standing still again, the line\r\nto which the must reaches, indicates its so-called weight, expressed by\r\ndegrees.\" The must should be weighed in an entirely fresh state, before\r\nit shows any sign of fermentation, and should be free from husks, and\r\npure.\r\n\r\nThis instrument, which is indispensable to every one who intends to\r\nmake wine, can be obtained in nearly every large town, from the\r\nprominent opticians. JACOB BLATTNER, at St. Louis keeps them for sale.\r\n\r\nThe saccharometer will indicate the amount of sugar in the must, and\r\nits use is so simple, that every one can soon become familiar with it.\r\nThe next step in the improvement of wines was to determine the amount\r\nof acids the must contained, and this problem has also been\r\nsuccessfully solved by the invention of the acidimeter:\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ACIDIMETER AND ITS USE.\r\n\r\n\"The first instrument of this kind which came into general use, was one\r\ninvented by DR. OTTO, and consists of a glass tube, from ten to twelve\r\ninches in length, half an inch in width, and closed at the lower end.\r\nFig. 33 shows OTTO'S Acidimeter.\r\n\r\n\"The tube is filled to the partition line _a_, with tincture of litmus.\r\nThe must to be examined, before it has begun to ferment is then poured\r\ninto the tube, until it reaches the line 0. The blue tincture of\r\nlitmus, which would still be blue, if water had been added, is turned\r\ninto rose-color by the action of the acids contained in the must.\r\n\r\n\"If a solution of 1,369 per cent, of caustic ammonia is added to this\r\nred fluid, and the tube is turned around to effect the necessary\r\nmixture, keeping its mouth closed with the thumb, after the addition of\r\nmore or less of the ammonical fluid, it will change into violet. This\r\ntinge indicates the saturation of the acids, and the height of the\r\nfluid in the tube now shows the quantity of acid in the must, by whole,\r\nhalf and fourth parts per cent. The lines marked 1, 2, 3, 4, indicate\r\nwhole per cents.; the short intermediate lines, one-fourth per cents.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 33.]\r\n\r\nWhen DR. GALL, shortly before the vintage of 1850, first publicly\r\nrecommended the dilution of the acids, he was obliged to refer to this\r\ninstrument, as already known, and everywhere at hand, which was at the\r\nsame time cheap, and simple in its use. \"It is true, however, that if\r\nmust is examined by this instrument, the quantity of acids contained in\r\nit, is really somewhat larger than indicated by the instrument; because\r\nthe acids contained in the must require for their saturation a weaker\r\nsolution of ammonia than acetic acid.\" As however, OTTO'S acidimeter\r\nshows about one eighth of the acids less than the must actually\r\ncontains, and about as much acids combined with earths is removed\r\nduring fermentation, DR. GALL recommends that the quantity of acids be\r\nreduced to 6-1/2, or at most 7 thousandths of OTTO'S acidimeter, and\r\nthe results have shown that this was about the right proportion; as the\r\nwines in which the acids were thus diluted were in favor with all\r\nconsumers.\r\n\r\n\"The acidimeter referred to was afterwards improved, by making the tube\r\nlonger and more narrow, and dividing it into tenths of per cents,\r\ninstead of fourths; thus dividing the whole above 0 into thousandths.\r\nBut although by this improved acidimeter the quantity of acids could be\r\nascertained with more nicety, there remained one defect, that in often\r\nturning the glass tube for mixing the fluids, some of the contents\r\nadhered to the thumb in closing its mouth. This defect was remedied in\r\na new acidimeter, invented by Mr. GEISLER, who also invented the new\r\nvaporimeter for the determination of the quantity of alcohol contained\r\nin wine. It is based on the same principle as OTTO'S, but differs\r\naltogether in its construction. It is composed of three parts, all made\r\nof glass; the mixing bottle, Fig. 34; the Pipette, Fig. 35; and the\r\nburette, Fig 36. Besides, there should be ready three small\r\nglasses--one filled with tincture of litmus, the second with a solution\r\nof 1,369 per ammonia, and the third with the must or wine to be tested;\r\nalso, a taller glass, or vessel, having its bottom covered with cotton,\r\nin which glass the burette, after it has been filled with the solution\r\nof ammonia, is to be placed in an upright position until wanted.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 34.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 35.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 36.]\r\n\r\n\"To use this instrument the must and the tincture of litmus, having\r\nfirst received the normal temperature of 14° Reaumer, are brought into\r\nthe mixing bottle by means of the pipette, which is a hollow tube of\r\nglass, open on both ends. To fill it, place its lower end into the\r\ntincture or must, apply the mouth to the upper end, and by means of\r\nsuction fill it with the tincture of litmus to above the line indicated\r\nat A. The opening of the top is then quickly closed with the thumb; by\r\nalternately raising the thumb, and pressing it down again, so much of\r\nthe tincture is then allowed to flow back into the glass so as to lower\r\nthe fluid to the line indicated at A. The remainder is then brought\r\ninto the bottle, and the last drops forced out by blowing into the\r\npipette.\r\n\r\n\"In filling it with must, raise the fluid in the same way, until it\r\ncomes up to the line indicated at B, and then empty into the mixing\r\nbottle.\r\n\r\n\"The burette consists of two hollow tubes of glass. In filling it, hold\r\nthe smaller tube with the right hand into the glass containing the\r\nsolution of ammonia, apply the mouth to the larger one, and by drawing\r\nin the fluid the tube is filled exactly to the line indicated at 0 of\r\nthe tube.\r\n\r\n\"Holding the mixing bottle by the neck between the thumb and forefinger\r\nof the left hand, place the smaller tube of the burette into the mouth\r\nof the mixing bottle, which must be constantly shaken; let enough of\r\nthe solution of ammonia be brought drop by drop, into the mixture in\r\nthe bottle, till the red has been changed into the deep reddish blue of\r\nthe purple onion. This is the sign of the proper saturation of the\r\nacids. To distinguish still better, turn the mixing bottle upside down,\r\nby closing its mouth with the thumb, and examine the color of the fluid\r\nin the tube-shaped neck of the bottle, and afterwards, should it be\r\nrequired, add another drop of the ammonia. Repeat this until the proper\r\ntone of color has been reached, neither red nor blue. After thus fixing\r\nthe precise point of the saturation of the acids, the burette is held\r\nupright, and the quantity of the solution of ammonia consumed is\r\naccurately determined,--that is, to what line on the scale the burette\r\nhas been emptied. The quantity of the solution so used corresponds with\r\nthe quantity of acids contained in the must--the larger division lines\r\nopposite the numbers indicating the thousandths part, and the smaller\r\nlines or dots the ten thousandths part.\r\n\r\n\"Until the eye has learned by practice to recognize the points of\r\nsaturation by the tone of color, it can be proven by means of litmus\r\npaper. When the mixture in the bottle begins to turn blue, put in the\r\nend of a slip of litmus paper about half an inch deep, and then draw\r\nthis end through your fingers, moistened with water. So long as the\r\nends of the blue litmus paper become more or less reddened, the acids\r\nhave not been completely saturated. Only when it remains blue, has the\r\npoint of saturation been reached.\r\n\r\n\"In examining _red_ must, the method should be modified as\r\nfollows:--Instead of first filling the pipette with tincture of litmus,\r\nfill it with water to the line A, and transfer it into the bottle.\r\nAfter the quantity of must has been added, drop six-thousandths of the\r\nsolution of ammonia into the mixture, constantly shaking it while\r\ndropping, then test it, and so on, until, after every further addition\r\nrequired with litmus paper, it is no longer reddened after having been\r\nwiped off.\"\r\n\r\nDR. GALL further gives the following directions, as a guide, to\r\ndistinguish and determine the proportion of acids which a must should\r\ncontain, to be still agreeable to the palate, and good:\r\n\r\n\"Chemists distinguish the acid contained in the grape as the vinous,\r\nmalic, grape, citric, tannic, gelatinous and para-citric acids. Whether\r\nall these are contained in the must, or which of them, is of small\r\nmoment for us to know. For the practical wine-maker, it is sufficient\r\nto know, with full certainty, that, as the grape ripens, while the\r\nproportion of sugar increases, the quantity of acids continually\r\ndiminishes; and hence, by leaving the grapes on the vines as long as\r\npossible, we have a double means of improving their products--the must\r\nor wine.\r\n\r\n\"All wines, without exception, to be of good and of agreeable taste,\r\nmust contain from 4-1/2 to 7 thousandths parts of free acids, and each\r\nmust containing more than seven thousandths parts of free acids may be\r\nconsidered as having too little water and sugar in proportion to its\r\nquantity of acids.\r\n\r\n\"In all wine-growing countries of Germany, for a number of years past,\r\nexperience has proved that a corresponding addition of sugar and water\r\nis the means of converting the sourest must, not only into a good\r\ndrinkable wine, but also into as good a wine as can be produced in\r\nfavorable years, _except_ in that peculiar and delicate aroma found\r\nonly in the must of well-ripened grapes, and which must and will always\r\ndistinguish the wines made in the best seasons from those made in poor\r\nseasons.\r\n\r\n\"The saccharometer and acidimeter, properly used, will give us the\r\nexact knowledge of what the must contains, and what it lacks; and we\r\nhave the means at hand, by adding water, to reduce the acids to their\r\nproper proportion; and by adding sugar, to increase the amount of sugar\r\nthe must should contain; in other words, we can change the poor must of\r\nindifferent seasons into the normal must of the best seasons in\r\n_everything_, _except_ its bouquet or aroma, thereby converting an\r\nunwholesome and disagreeable drink into an agreeable and healthy one.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CHANGE OF THE MUST, BY FERMENTATION, INTO WINE.\r\n\r\nLet us glance for a few moments at this wonderful, simple, and yet so\r\ncomplicated process, to give a clearer insight into the functions which\r\nman has to perform to assist Nature, and have her work for him, to\r\nattain the desired end. I cannot put the matter in a better light for\r\nmy readers than to quote again from DR. GALL. He says:--\"To form a\r\ncorrect opinion of what may and can be done in the manufacture of wine,\r\nwe must be thoroughly convinced that Nature, in her operations, has\r\nother objects in view than merely to serve man as his careful cook and\r\nbutler. Had the highest object of the Creator, in the creation of the\r\ngrape, been simply to combine in the juice of the fruit nothing but\r\nwhat is indispensable to the formation of that delicious beverage for\r\nthe accommodation of man, it might have been still easier done for him\r\nby at once filling the berries with wine already made. But in the\r\nproduction of fruits, the first object of all is to provide for the\r\npropagation and preservation of the species. Each fruit contains the\r\ngerm of a new plant, and a quantity of nutritious matter surrounding\r\nand developing that germ. The general belief is, that this nutritious\r\nmatter, and even the peculiar combination in which it is found in the\r\nfruit, has been made directly for the immediate use of man. This,\r\nhowever, is a mistake. The nutritious matter of the grape, as in the\r\napple, pear, or any similar product, is designed by Nature only to\r\nserve as the first nourishment of the future plant, the germ of which\r\nlies in it. There are thousands of fruits of no use whatever, and are\r\neven noxious to man, and there are thousands more which, before they\r\ncan be used, must be divested of certain parts, necessary, indeed, to\r\nthe nutrition of the future plant, but unfit, in its present state, for\r\nthe use or nourishment of man. For instance, barley contains starch,\r\nmucilaginous sugar, gum, adhesive matter, vegetable albumen, phosphate\r\nof lime, oil, fibre and water. All these are necessary to the formation\r\nof roots, stalks, leaves, flowers and the new grain; but for the\r\nmanufacture of beer, the brewer needs only the first three substances.\r\nThe same rule applies to the grape.\r\n\r\n\"In this use of the grape, all depends upon the judgment of man to\r\nselect such of its parts as he wishes, and by his skill he adapts and\r\napplies them in the best manner for his purposes. In eating the grapes,\r\nhe throws away the skins and seeds; for raisins, he evaporates the\r\nwater, retaining only the solid parts, from which, when he uses them,\r\nhe rejects their seeds. If he manufactures must, he lets the skins\r\nremain. In making wine, he sets free the carbonic acid contained in the\r\nmust, and removes the lees, gum, tartar, and, in short, everything\r\ndeposited during, and immediately after fermentation, as well as when\r\nit is put into casks and bottles. He not only removes from the wine its\r\nsediments, but watches the fermentation, and checks it as soon as its\r\nvinous fermentation is over, and the formation of vinegar about to\r\nbegin. He refines his wine by an addition of foreign substances if\r\nnecessary; he sulphurizes it; and, by one means or another, remedies\r\nits distempers.\r\n\r\n\"The manufacture of wine is thus a many-sided art; and he who does not\r\nunderstand it, or knows not how to guide and direct the powers of\r\nNature to his own purposes, may as well give up all hopes of success in\r\nit.\"\r\n\r\nSo far DR. GALL; and to the intelligent and unbiased mind, the truth\r\nand force of these remarks will be apparent, without further extending\r\nor explaining them. How absurd, then, the blind ravings of those who\r\ntalk about \"natural\" wines, and would condemn every addition of sugar\r\nand water to the must by man, when Nature has not fully done her part,\r\nas adulteration and fraud. Why, there is no such thing as a \"natural\r\nwine;\" for wine--good wine--is the product of art, and a manufacture\r\nfrom beginning to end. Would we not think that parent extremely cruel,\r\nas well as foolish, who would have her child without clothing, simply\r\nbecause Nature had allowed it to be born without it? Would not the\r\nchild suffer and die, because its mother failed to aid Nature in her\r\nwork, by clothing and feeding it when it is yet unable to feed and\r\nclothe itself? And yet, would not that wine-maker act equally foolish\r\nwho has it within his power to remedy the deficiencies of Nature with\r\nsuch means as she herself supplies in good season, and which ought and\r\nwould be in the must but for unfavorable circumstances, over which we\r\nhave no control? Wine thus improved is just as pure as if the sugar and\r\nwater had naturally been in the grapes in right proportions; just as\r\nbeneficial to health; and only the fanatical \"know-nothing\" can call it\r\nadulterated. But the prejudices will disappear before the light of\r\nscience and truth, however much ignorance may clamor against it.\r\nGALILEO, when forced to abjure publicly his great discovery of the\r\nmotion of the earth around the sun as a heresy and lie, murmured\r\nbetween his teeth the celebrated words, \"And yet it moves.\" It _did_\r\nmove; and the theory is now an acknowledged truth, with which every\r\nschoolboy is familiar. Thus will it be with improved wine-making. It\r\nwill yet be followed, generally and universally, as sure as the public\r\nwill learn to distinguish between good and poor wine.\r\n\r\nLet us now observe for a moment the change which fermentation makes in\r\nconverting the must into wine. The nitrogeneous compounds--vegetable\r\nalbumen, gluten--which are contained in the grape, and which are\r\ndissolved in the must as completely as the sugar, under certain\r\ncircumstances turn into the fermenting principle, and so change the\r\nmust into wine. This change is brought about by the fermenting\r\nsubstance coming into contact with the air, and receiving oxygen from\r\nit, in consequence of which it coagulates, and shows itself in the\r\nturbid state of must, or young wine. The coagulation of the lees takes\r\nplace but gradually, and just in the degree the exhausted lees settle.\r\nThe sugar gradually turns into alcohol. The acids partly remain as\r\ntartaric acid, are partly turned into ether, or settle with the lees,\r\nchrystallize, and adhere to the bottom of the casks. The etheric oil,\r\nor aroma, remains, and develops into bouquet; also the tannin, to a\r\ncertain degree. The albumen and gluten principally settle, although a\r\nsmall portion of them remains in the wine. The coloring matter and\r\nextractive principle remain, but change somewhat by fermentation.\r\n\r\nThus it is the must containing a large amount of sugar needs a longer\r\ntime to become clear than that containing but a small portion of it;\r\ntherefore, many southern wines retain a certain amount of sugar\r\nundecomposed, and they are called _sweet_, or liqueur wines; whereas,\r\nwines in which the whole of the sugar has been decomposed are called\r\n_sour_ or _dry_ wines.\r\n\r\nI have thought it necessary to be thus explicit to give my readers an\r\ninsight into the general principles which should govern us in\r\nwine-making. I have quoted freely from the excellent work of DR. GALL.\r\nWe will now see whether and how we can reduce it to practice. I will\r\ntry and illustrate this by an example.\r\n\r\n\r\nNORMAL MUST.\r\n\r\n\"Experiments continued for a number of years have proved that, in\r\nfavorable seasons, grape juice contains, on the average, in 1,000 lbs.:\r\n\r\nSugar,   240 lbs.\r\nAcids,     6  \"\r\nWater,   754  \"\r\n       -----\r\n       1,000  \"\r\n\r\nThis proportion would constitute what I call a normal must. But now we\r\nhave an inferior season, and the must contains, instead of the above\r\nproportions, as follows:\r\n\r\nSugar,   150 lbs.\r\nAcids,     9  \"\r\nWater,   841  \"\r\n       -----\r\n       1,000  \"\r\n\r\nWhat must we do to bring such must to the condition of a normal must?\r\nThis is the question thus arising. To solve it, we calculate thus: If,\r\nin six pounds of acids in a normal wine, 240 pounds of sugar appear,\r\nhow much sugar is wanted for nine pounds of acids? Answer, 360 pounds.\r\nOur next question is: If, in six pounds of acids in a normal must, 754\r\npounds of water appear, how much water is required for nine pounds of\r\nacids? Answer, 1,131 pounds. As, therefore, the must which we intend to\r\nimprove by neutralizing its acids, should contain 360 pounds of sugar,\r\nnine pounds of acids, and 1,131 pounds of water, but contains already\r\n150 pounds of sugar, 9 pounds of acids, and 841 pounds of water, there\r\nremain to be added, 210 pounds of sugar, no acids, and 290 pounds of\r\nwater.\r\n\r\nBy ameliorating a quantity of 1,000 pounds must by 210 pounds sugar,\r\nand 290 pounds water, we obtain 1,500 pounds of must, consisting of the\r\nsame properties as the normal must, which makes a first-class wine.\"\r\n\r\nThis is wine-making, according to GALL'S method, in Europe. Now, let us\r\nsee what we can do with it on American soil, and with American grapes.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MUST OF AMERICAN GRAPES.\r\n\r\nIf we examine the must of most of our American wine grapes closely, we\r\nfind that they not only contain an excess of acids in inferior seasons,\r\nbut also a superabundance of flavor or aroma, and of tannin and\r\ncoloring matter. Especially of flavor, there is such an abundance that,\r\nwere the quantity doubled by addition of sugar and water, there would\r\nstill be an abundance; and with some varieties, such as the Concord, if\r\nfermented on the husks, it is so strong as to be disagreeable. We must,\r\ntherefore, not only ameliorate the acid, but also the flavor and the\r\nastringency, of which the tannin is the principal cause. Therefore it\r\nis, that to us the knowledge of how to properly gallize our wines is\r\nstill more important than to the European vintner, and the results\r\nwhich we can realize are yet more important. By a proper management, we\r\ncan change must, which would otherwise make a disagreeable wine, into\r\none in which everything is in its proper proportion, and which will\r\ndelight the consumer, to whose fastidious taste if would otherwise have\r\nbeen repugnant. True, we have here a more congenial climate, and the\r\ngrapes will generally ripen better, so that we can in most seasons\r\nproduce a drinkable wine. But if we can increase the quantity, and at\r\nthe same time improve the quality, there is certainly an inducement,\r\nwhich the practical business sense of our people will not fail to\r\nappreciate and make use of.\r\n\r\nThere is, however, one difficulty in the way. I do not believe that the\r\nacidimeter can yet be obtained in the country, and we must import them\r\ndirect from the manufacturers, DR. L. C. MARQUART, of Bonn, on the\r\nRhine; or J. DIEHN, Frankfort-on-the-Main.\r\n\r\nHowever, this difficulty will soon be overcome; and, indeed, although\r\nit is impossible to practice gallizing without a saccharometer, we may\r\nget at the surplus of acids with tolerable certainty by the results\r\nshown by the saccharometer. To illustrate this, I will give an example:\r\n\r\nLast year was one of the most unfavorable seasons for the ripening of\r\ngrapes we have ever had here, and especially the Catawba lost almost\r\nnine-tenths of its crop by mildew and rot; it also lost its leaves, and\r\nthe result was, that the grapes did not ripen well. When gathering my\r\ngrapes, upon weighing the must, I found that it ranged from 52° to 70°;\r\nwhereas, in good seasons, Catawba must weighs from 80° to 95°. I now\r\ncalculated thus: if normal must of Catawba should weigh at least 80°,\r\nand the must I have to deal with this season will weigh on an average\r\nonly 60°, I must add to this must about 1/2 lb. of sugar to bring it up\r\nto 80°. But now I had the surplus acid to neutralize yet. To do this, I\r\ncalculated thus: If, even in a normal Catawba must, or a must of the\r\nbest seasons, there is yet an excess of acid, I can safely count on\r\nthere being at least one-third too much acid in a must that weighs but\r\n60°. I, therefore, added to every 100 gallons of must 40 gallons of\r\nsoft water, in which I had first dissolved 80 lbs. of crushed sugar,\r\nwhich brought the water, when weighed after dissolving the sugar in it,\r\nup to 80°. Now, I had yet to add 50 lbs., or half a pound to each\r\ngallon of the original must, to bring _this_ up to 80°. I thus pressed,\r\ninstead of 100 gallons, 150 gallons, from the same quantity of grapes;\r\nand the result was a wine, which every one who has tasted it has\r\ndeclared to be excellent Catawba. It has a brilliant pale yellow color,\r\nwas perfectly clear 1st of January, and sold by me to the first one to\r\nwhom I offered it, at a price which I have seldom realized for Catawba\r\nwine made in the best seasons, without addition of sugar or water.\r\nTrue, it has not as strong an aroma as the Catawba of our best seasons,\r\nnor has it as much astringency; but this latter I consider an\r\nadvantage, and it still has abundant aroma to give it character.\r\n\r\nAnother experiment I made with the Concord satisfied me, without\r\nquestion, that the must of this grape will always gain by an addition\r\nof water and sugar. I pressed several casks of the pure juice, which,\r\nas the Concord had held its leaves and ripened its fruit very well,\r\ncontained sugar enough to make a fair wine, namely, 75°. This I\r\ngenerally pressed the day after gathering, and put into separate casks.\r\nI then took some must of the same weight, but to which I had added, to\r\nevery 100 gallons, 50 gallons of water, in which I had diluted sugar\r\nuntil the water weighed 75°, or not quite two pounds of sugar to the\r\ngallon of water, pressed also after the expiration of the same time,\r\nand otherwise treated in the same manner. Both were treated exactly\r\nalike, racked at the same time; and the result is, that every one who\r\ntries the two wines, without knowing how they have been treated,\r\nprefers the gallized wine to the other--the pure juice of the grape. It\r\nis more delicate in flavor, has less acidity, and a more brilliant\r\ncolor than the first, the ungallized must. They are both excellent, but\r\nthere is a difference in favor of the gallized wine.\r\n\r\nDR. GALL recommends grape sugar as the best to be used for the purpose.\r\nThis is made from potato starch; but it is hard to obtain here, and I\r\nhave found crushed loaf sugar answer every purpose. I think this sugar\r\nhas the advantage over grape sugar, that it dissolves more readily, and\r\ncan even be dissolved in cold water, thus simplifying the process very\r\nmuch. It will take about two pounds to the gallon of water to bring\r\nthis up to 80°, which will make a wine of sufficient body. The average\r\nprice of sugar was about 22 cents per pound, and the cost of thus\r\nproducing an additional gallon of wine, counting in labor, interest on\r\ncapital, etc., will be about 60 cents. When the wine can be sold at\r\nfrom $2 to $3 per gallon, the reader will easily perceive of what\r\nimmense advantage this method is to the grape-grower, if he can thereby\r\nnot only improve the quality, but also increase the quantity of the\r\nyield.\r\n\r\nThe efforts made by the Commissioner of Patents, and the contributors\r\nto the annual reports from the Patent Office, to diffuse a general\r\nknowledge of this process, can therefore not be commended too highly.\r\nIt will help much to bring into general use, among all classes, good,\r\npure, native wines; and as soon as ever the poorer classes can obtain\r\ncheap agreeable wines, the use of bad whiskey and brandy will be\r\nabandoned more and more, and this nation will become a more temperate\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nBut this is only the first step. There is a way to still further\r\nincrease the quantity. DR. GALL and others found, by analyzing the\r\nhusks of the grape after the juice had been extracted by powerful\r\npresses, that they not only still contained a considerable amount of\r\njuice, but also a great amount of extracts, or wine-making principles,\r\nin many instances sufficient for three times the bulk of the juice\r\nalready expressed. This fact suggested the question: As there are so\r\nmany of these valuable properties left, and only sugar and water\r\nexhausted, why cannot these be substituted until the others are\r\ncompletely exhausted? It was found that the husks still contained\r\nsufficient of acids, tannin, aroma, coloring matter, and gluten. All\r\nthat remained to be added was water and sugar. It was found that this\r\ncould be easily done; and the results showed that wine made in this\r\nmanner was equal, if not superior, to some of that made from the\r\noriginal juice, and was often, by the best judges, preferred to that\r\nmade from the original must.\r\n\r\nI have also practiced this method extensively the last season; and the\r\nresult is, that I have fully doubled the amount of wine of the Norton's\r\nVirginia and Concord. I have thus made 2,500 gallons of Concord, where\r\nI had but 1,030 gallons of original must; and 2,600 gallons of Norton's\r\nVirginia, where I had but 1,300 gallons of must. The wines thus made\r\nwere kept strictly separate from those made from the original juice,\r\nand the result is, that many of them are better, and none inferior, to\r\nthe original must; and although I have kept a careful diary of\r\nwine-making, in which I have noted the process how each cask was made,\r\nperiod of fermentation on the husks, quantity of sugar used, etc., and\r\nhave not hesitated to show this to every purchaser after he had tasted\r\nof the wine, they generally, and with very few exceptions, chose those\r\nwhich had either been gallized in part, or entirely.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 37.\r\nUNION VILLAGE.--_Berries 1/3 diameter._]\r\n\r\nMy method in making such wines was very simple. I generally took the\r\nsame quantity of water, the husks had given original must, or in other\r\nwords, when I had pressed 100 gallons of juice, I took about 80 gallons\r\nof water. To make Concord wine, I added 1-3/4 lbs. of sugar to the\r\ngallon, as I calculated upon some sugar remaining in the husks, which\r\nwere not pressed entirely dry. This increased the quantity, with the\r\njuice yet contained in the husks to 100 gallons, and brought the water\r\nto 70; calculating that from 5° to 10° still remained in the husks, it\r\nwould give us a must of about 80°. The grapes, as before remarked, had\r\nbeen gathered during the foregoing day, and were generally pressed in\r\nthe morning. As soon as possible the husks were turned into the\r\nfermenting vat again, all pulled apart and broken, and the water added\r\nto them. As the fermentation had been very strong before, it\r\nimmediately commenced again. I generally allowed them to ferment for\r\ntwenty-four hours, and then pressed again, but pressed as dry as\r\npossible this time. The whole treatment of this must was precisely\r\nsimilar to that of the original.\r\n\r\nIn making Norton's Virginia, I would take, instead of 1-3/4 lbs., 2\r\nlbs. of sugar to the gallon--as it is naturally a wine of greater body\r\nthan the Concord--and I aimed to come as near to the natural must as\r\npossible. I generally fermented this somewhat longer, as a darker color\r\nwas desired. The time of fermentation must vary, of course, with the\r\nstate of the atmosphere; in cooler weather, both pressings should\r\nremain longer on the husks. The results, in both varieties were wines\r\nof excellent flavor, good body, a brilliant color, with enough of\r\ntannin or astringency, and sufficient acid--therefore, in every way\r\nsatisfactory.\r\n\r\nThe experiments, however, were not confined to these alone, but\r\nextended over a number of varieties, with good results in every case.\r\nOf all varieties tried, however, I found that the Concord would bear\r\nthe most of gallizing, without losing its own peculiar flavor; and I\r\nsatisfied myself, that the quantity in this grape can safely be\r\nincreased _here_, from 100 gallons of must to 250 gallons of wine, and\r\nthe quality yet be better, than if the must had been left in its normal\r\ncondition.\r\n\r\nAnd it is here again where only experience can teach us _how far_ we\r\ncan go with a certain variety. It must be clear and apparent to any one\r\nwho is ever so slightly acquainted with wine-making, how widely\r\ndifferent the varieties are in their characteristics and ingredients.\r\nWe may lay it down as a general rule, however, that our native grapes,\r\nwith their strong and peculiar flavors, and their superabundance of\r\ntannin and coloring matter, will admit of much more gallizing, than the\r\nmore delicately flavored European kinds.\r\n\r\nI have thus tried only to give an outline of the necessary operations,\r\nas well as the principles lying at the foundation of them. I have also\r\nspoken only of facts as I have found them, as I am well aware that this\r\nis a field in which I have much to learn yet, and where it but poorly\r\nbecomes me to act the part of teacher. Those desiring more detailed\r\ninformation, I would refer to the Patent Office Reports of 1859-60,\r\nwhere they will find valuable extracts from the works of DR. GALL; and\r\nalso to the original works.\r\n\r\nIf we look at the probable effect these methods of improving wines are\r\nlikely to have upon grape-culture, it is but natural that we should ask\r\nthe question: Is there anything reprehensible in the practice--any\r\nreason why it should not become general? The answer to this is very\r\nsimple. They contain nothing which the fermented grape juice, in its\r\npurest and most perfect state does not also contain. Therefore, they\r\nare as pure as any grape juice can be, with the consideration in their\r\nfavor, that everything is in the right proportion. Therefore, if wine\r\nmade from pure grape juice can be recommended for general use, surely,\r\nthe gallized wines can also be recommended. DR. GALL has repeatedly\r\noffered to pay a fine for the benefit of the poor, if the most critical\r\nchemical analysis could detect anything in them, which was injurious to\r\nhealth, or which pure wines ought not to contain, and his opponents\r\nhave always failed to show anything of the kind.\r\n\r\nI know that some of my wine-making friends will blame me for thus\r\n\"letting the cat out of the bag.\" They seem to think that it would be\r\nbetter to keep the knowledge we have gained, to ourselves, carefully\r\neven hiding the fact that any of our wines have been gallized. But it\r\nhas always been a deep-seated conviction with me, that knowledge and\r\ntruth, like God's sun should be the common property of all His\r\nchildren--and that it is the duty of every one not to \"hide his light\r\nunder a bushel,\" but seek to impart it to all, who could, perhaps, be\r\nbenefitted by it. And why, in reality, should we seek to keep as a\r\nsecret a practice which is perfectly right and justifiable? If there is\r\na prejudice against it, (and we know there is), this is not the way to\r\ncombat it. Only by meeting it openly, and showing the fallacy of it,\r\ncan we hope to convince the public, that there is nothing wrong about\r\nit. Truth and justice need never fear the light--they can only gain\r\nadditional force from it. I do not even attempt to sell a cask of\r\ngallized wine, before the purchaser is made fully acquainted with the\r\nfact, that it has been gallized.\r\n\r\nIt is a matter of course, that many, who go to work carelessly and\r\nslovenly, will fail to make good wine, in this or any other way. To\r\nmake a good article, the nature of each variety and its peculiarities\r\nmust be closely studied--we must have as ripe grapes as we can get,\r\ncarefully gathered; and we need not think that water and sugar will\r\naccomplish _everything_. There is a limit to everything, and to\r\ngallizing as well as to anything else. As soon as we pass beyond that\r\nlimit, an inferior product will be the result.\r\n\r\nBut let us glance a moment at the probable influence this discovery\r\nwill have on American grape culture. It cannot be otherwise than in the\r\nhighest degree beneficial; for when we simply look at grape-culture as\r\nit was ten years ago, with the simple product of the Catawba as its\r\nbasis; a variety which would only yield an average of, say 200 gallons\r\nto the acre--often very inferior wine--and look at it to-day, with such\r\nvarieties as the Concord, yielding an average of from 1,000 to 1,500\r\ngallons to the acre, which we can yet easily double by gallizing, thus\r\nin reality yielding an average of 2,500 gallons to the acre of\r\nuniformly good wine; can we be surprised if everybody talks and thinks\r\nof raising grapes? Truly, the time is not far distant--of which we\r\nhardly dared to dream ten years ago--and which we _then_ thought we\r\nwould never live to see; when _every_ American citizen can indulge in a\r\ndaily glass of that glorious gift of God to man, pure, light wine; and\r\nthe American nation shall become a really _temperate_ people.\r\n\r\nAnd there is room for all. Let every one further the cause of\r\ngrape-culture. The laborer by producing the grapes and wine; the\r\nmechanic by inventions; the law-giver by making laws furthering its\r\nculture, and the consumption of it; and _all_ by drinking wine, in wise\r\nmoderation of course.\r\n\r\n\r\nWINE MAKING MADE EASY.\r\n\r\nSome of my readers may think I did not look much to this, which I told\r\nthem was one of the objects of this little work. To vindicate it and\r\nmyself I will here state, that our object should always be to attain\r\nthe highest perfection in everything. But, while I am aware that I have\r\ngenerally given the outline of operations on a large scale, I have\r\nnever for a moment lost sight of the interests of those, who, like\r\nmyself, are compelled, by bitter necessity, to commence at the lowest\r\nround of the ladder. And how could I forget the bitter experience of my\r\nfirst years, when hindered by want of means; but also the feelings of\r\nsincere joy, of glad triumph, when I had surmounted one more obstacle,\r\nand saw the path open wider before me at every step; and I can,\r\ntherefore, fully sympathize with the poor laborer, who has nothing but\r\nhis industrious hands and honest will to commence with.\r\n\r\nWhile, therefore, it is most advantageous to follow grape-growing and\r\nwine-making with all the conveniences of well prepared soil,\r\nsubstantial trellis, a commodious wine cellar and all its\r\nappurtenances; yet, it is also possible to do without most of these\r\nconveniencies in the beginning, and yet succeed. If the grape-grower\r\nhas not capital to spare to buy wire, he can, if he has timber on his\r\nland, split laths and nail them to the posts instead of wire. He can\r\nlayer his plants even the first summer, and thus raise a stock for\r\nfurther planting; or dispose of them, as already mentioned in the\r\nbeginning of this work. Or he can lease a piece of land from some one\r\nwho wishes to have a vineyard planted on it, and who will furnish the\r\nplants to him, besides the necessary capital for the first year or so.\r\nI have contracted with several men without means in this manner,\r\nfurnished them a small house, the necessary plants, and paid them $150\r\nthe first two years, they giving me half the returns of the vineyards,\r\nin plants and grapes; and they have become wealthy by such means. One\r\nof my tenants has realized over $8,000 for his share the last season,\r\nand will very likely realize the same amount next season.\r\n\r\nAnd if he cannot afford to build a large cellar in the beginning, he\r\ncan also do with a small one, even the most common house cellar will do\r\nthrough the winter, if it is only kept free from frost. One of our most\r\nsuccessful wine-growers here, commenced his operations with a simple\r\nhole in the ground, dug under his house, and his first wine press was\r\nmerely a large beam, let into a tree, which acted as a lever upon the\r\ngrapes, with a press-bed, also of his own making. A few weeks ago the\r\nsame man sold his last year's crop of wine for over $9,000 in cash, and\r\nhas raised some $2,000 worth more in vines, cuttings, etc. Of course,\r\nit is not advisable to keep the wine over summer in an indifferent\r\ncellar, but during fermentation and the greater part of winter, it will\r\nanswer very well, and he can easily dispose of his wine, if good, as\r\nsoon as clear. Or he can dispose of his grapes at a fair price, to one\r\nof his neighbors, or take them to market.\r\n\r\nBut there is another consideration, which I cannot urge too strongly\r\nupon my readers, and which will do much to make grape-growing and\r\nwine-making easy. It is the forming of grape colonies, of\r\ngrape-growers' villages. The advantages of such a colony will be easily\r\nseen. If each one has a small piece of suitable land, (and he does not\r\nneed a large one to follow grape-growing), the neighbors can easily\r\nassist each other in ploughing and sub-soiling; they will be able to do\r\nwith fewer work animals, as they can hitch together, and first prepare\r\nthe soil for one and then for the other; the ravages of birds and\r\ninsects will hardly be felt; they can join together, and build a large\r\ncellar in common, where each one can deliver and store his wine, and of\r\nwhich one perhaps better acquainted with the management of wine than\r\nthe others, and whom all are willing to trust, can have the management.\r\nIf there should be no such man among them, an experienced cooper can be\r\nhired by all, who can also manufacture the necessary casks. An\r\nassociation of that kind has also, generally, the preference in the\r\nmarket over a single individual, and they are able to obtain a higher\r\nprice for their products, if they are of good quality.\r\n\r\nThere are thousands upon thousands of acres of the best grape lands yet\r\nto be had in the West, especially in Missouri, at a merely nominal\r\nprice, which would be well adapted for settlements of that kind; where\r\nthe virgin soil yet waits only the bidding of intelligent labor--of\r\nenterprising and industrious men--to bring forth the richest fruits.\r\nThere is room for all--may it soon be filled with willing hearts to\r\nundertake the task.\r\n\r\nAnd how much easier for you to-day, men with the active hand and\r\nintelligent brain, to commence--with the certainty of success before\r\nyou--with varieties which will yield a large and sure return _every_\r\nyear; with the market open before you, and the experience of those who\r\nhave commenced, to guide you; with the reputation of American wines\r\nestablished; with double the price per gallon--and ten times the\r\nyield--compared with the beginner of only ten years ago, with nothing\r\nbut uncertainty; uncertainty of yield, uncertainty of quality, of\r\nprice, and of effecting a sale.\r\n\r\nIt took a brave heart _then_, and an iron will; the determination to\r\nsucceed,--succeed against _all_ obstacles. And yet, hundreds have\r\ncommenced thus, and have succeeded. Can _you_ hesitate, when the future\r\nis all bright before you, and the thousand and one obstacles have been\r\novercome? If you do, you are not fit to be a grape-grower. Go toil and\r\ndrudge for so many cents per day, in some factory, and end life as you\r\nhave begun it. God's free air, the cultivation of one of His noblest\r\ngifts, destined to \"make glad the heart in this rugged world of ours,\"\r\nis not for you. I may pity you, but I cannot sympathize with nor assist\r\nyou, except by raising a cheap glass of wine to gladden even _your_\r\ncheerless lot.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 38.\r\nMAXATAWNY.--_Berries 1/2 diameter._]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSTATISTICS.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOST OF ESTABLISHING A VINEYARD.\r\n\r\nIn this, of course, allowances must be made for soil, locality, cost of\r\nplants, cost of timber, etc., which will vary with the locality.

The vines were not all in bearing this last\r\nseason, for reasons already given; and the whole amount of vines\r\nbearing, was not more than 2,200--hardly two acres. If my readers will\r\ncontrast this with the yield of the Catawba vineyard, they will see the\r\ndifference in yield between varieties suited to the climate and soil,\r\nand those unused to it.\r\n\r\nThe last season--although unfavorable to the Catawba--produced an\r\nenormous yield of Concord and Norton's Virginia, and cannot be taken as\r\nan average crop. I think about 700 gallons of Norton's Virginia, and\r\n1,200 gallons of Concord would be a fair average estimate per\r\nyear--which the vines can easily produce, and remain healthy and\r\nvigorous.\r\n\r\n\r\nYIELD OF MR.

I regret to say that our Cincinnati friends have not,\r\ngenerally speaking, paid as much attention to the introduction and\r\ntesting of better varieties--and there are but few vineyards in that\r\nneighborhood--where any other variety than the Catawba has been planted\r\nto any extent. It is to be hoped that the signal failure of that variety\r\nlast season will do much to open their eyes to the full importance of\r\nthe subject, and to abandon the Catawba, which evidently will not pay\r\nany longer.\r\n\r\nBut, as we have already said, there are other varieties of grapes being\r\nsuccessfully grown in this vicinity, and we have extended our researches\r\nto some of those vineyards, and give the results as follows:--\r\n\r\nIves' Seedling is a grape of much promise, not addicted to mildew and\r\nrot. Col. WAHRING, of Indian Hill, in this county, has a small vineyard,\r\nonly two acres in bearing, which made, the past season, 650 gallons of\r\nwine. The season previous, only one acre in bearing, yielded 560\r\ngallons. The Colonel makes his account for the past season's business\r\nstand as follows:--\r\n\r\n650 gallons of wine, sold at $4.10 per gallon,    $2,665 00\r\nSale of cuttings,                                  1,500 00\r\n                                                   --------\r\n                                                  $4,165 00\r\nDeduct cost of taking care of vineyard,              100 00\r\n                                                   --------\r\nLeaving net product of vineyard,                  $4,065 00\r\n  Or over $2,000 per acre.\r\n\r\nNorton's Virginia is another promising grape that is being grown\r\nconsiderably hereabouts.\r\n\r\nThe Messrs. BOGEN have given us their figures for the product of this\r\ngrape, as follows:\r\n\r\n1863--From 1-1/2 acres, first year in bearing,\r\n  they made 500 gallons, sold at $3 per gallon,   $1,500 00\r\nSale of cuttings,                                    400 00\r\nSale of roots from layers,                           800 00\r\n                                                   --------\r\n                                                  $2,700 00\r\nDeduct from this, for cost of culture,               100 00\r\n                                                   --------\r\nLeaves net,                                       $2,600 00\r\n  Or $1,733 per acre.\r\n\r\n1864--Yield of same in wine and cuttings,          2,300 00\r\n  Or about $1,500 per acre.\r\n\r\nDelaware is another grape of very great promise and profit, now being\r\nextensively grown throughout the country.

A. THOMPSON.\r\n          JOHN E. MOTTIER.\r\n\r\nThe foregoing contains some valuable facts, but it would seem to me\r\nthat our Cincinnati friends have hardly estimated labor and expenses\r\nhigh enough. We cannot begin to cultivate our vineyards at as low an\r\nestimate.\r\n\r\nThe following is a rough estimate of the last season's crop around\r\nHermann. It may be rather inaccurate, but it is about as near as I\r\ncould come to the result. There are now, I suppose, something like\r\n1,000 acres planted in grapes, of which about 400 may be in bearing.\r\nUnfortunately, nearly all the old vineyards are planted with the\r\nCatawba, which was almost an entire failure this season, the average\r\ncrop being only about 75 gallons to the acre. Most of the later\r\nplanting has been done with the Concord and Norton's Virginia, but\r\nthese vineyards are not bearing yet. Of the Norton's Virginia, the\r\naverage crop the last season may have been about 600 gallons to the\r\nacre; of the Concord, 1,000 gallons per acre. The Herbemont may have\r\nyielded about 800 gallons to the acre.\r\n\r\nGrapes marketed, mostly Concord, 20,000 lbs.\r\n  average price, 15c. per lb.,                              $3,000 00\r\nCatawba wine made, about 25,000 gallons;\r\n  average value, $1.50 per gallon,                          37,500 00\r\nNorton's Virginia wine made, about 10,000 gallons;\r\n  average value, $4 per gallon,                             40,000 00\r\nConcord wine made, about 5,000 gallons;\r\n  average value, $2.50 per gallon,                          12,500 00\r\nHerbemont wine made, about 1,500 gallons;\r\n  average value, $3 per gallon,                              4,500 00\r\nOther varieties made, about 1,000 gallons;\r\n  average value, $3 per gallons,                             3,000 00\r\nGrape roots, cuttings, etc., grown and sold,                50,000 00\r\n                                                           ----------\r\n                                                          $150,500 00\r\n\r\nI think the above is rather below the real amount; and the value of the\r\ncrop may come up even as high as $200,000.\r\n\r\nAlthough grape culture is followed to a larger extent around Hermann\r\nthan anywhere in the State, yet there are also a great many grapes\r\ngrown and wine made around Boonville, in Cooper County; and Augusta,\r\nSt. Charles County; also, Hannibal, on the Mississippi river; and St.\r\nJoseph, on the Missouri; and there is hardly a county in the State now\r\nbut has some flourishing vineyards.\r\n\r\nThe above facts may serve to give my readers a clearer insight into the\r\ncost and profits of grape-growing, and also the comparative varieties.\r\nIn every case, the figures given can be relied on as actual facts.\r\n\r\nIn our neighboring States, Illinois and Iowa, grape-growing is\r\nprogressing rapidly. There are already a number of vineyards established\r\nin the neighborhood of Alton, Belleville, Mascoutah, Warsaw, and Nauvoo,\r\nin Illinois; and in the neighborhood of Burlington and Davenport, in\r\nIowa. I am told that in the neighborhood of Makanda alone, in Jackson\r\nCounty, Illinois, at least 70,000 vines of the Concord will be planted\r\nthe coming spring.\r\n\r\nOur sister State, Kansas, is also progressing bravely in the good work;\r\nand I do not think that, although our propagators throughout the\r\ncountry have done their best, there will be half the number of vines\r\nfor sale that are wanted to meet the demand.\r\n\r\nBut, while I am fully aware of the importance of grape-culture\r\n_everywhere_, I cannot help but believe that the southwest will\r\ntake the preference in grape-growing over the eastern and northern\r\nStates. We have the advantages of longer seasons and a warmer climate,\r\ngenerally of richer soil, of cheaper lands; we can cultivate varieties\r\nwhich cannot be grown by our eastern brethren, and therefore all the\r\nchances are on our side. The mountainous regions of Tennessee, Georgia,\r\nArkansas, Texas, and Alabama may, perhaps, rival and even surpass us in\r\nthe future, but their inhabitants at present are not of the clay from\r\nwhich grape-growers are formed. They still cling to the demon of\r\nslavery, and their hatred of northern industrious _freemen_ seems\r\nto be stronger than their love of prosperity. Let us hope that a better\r\nspirit may prevail, that they will in time begin to see their own\r\ninterest, and welcome with open arms every one who can assist them in\r\ndeveloping the natural advantages of their lands. The grape can only\r\nflourish on _free_ soil, and by _free_ intelligent labor.",
