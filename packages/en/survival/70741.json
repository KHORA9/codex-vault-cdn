B. MARTIN, in Charge, Southern States, Office of Cooperative\r\nExtension Work\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAGRICULTURAL STATUS OF THE NEGRO\r\n\r\n\r\nHome ownership is the largest factor in the solution of the so-called\r\nnegro problem. Cooperative extension work, especially since the\r\ncomprehensive organization of negro extension agents, has been one of\r\nthe greatest influences in encouraging and helping negroes to become\r\nlandowners and to succeed with land investments. Energetic negroes\r\nsoon learn thrift and have the ability to become good demonstrators.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 1.—Negro home remodeled and beautified according to plans and\r\n  suggestions furnished by the negro extension agent. Home ownership\r\n  and improved living conditions are important factors in obtaining\r\n  a permanent upbuilding of the negro farm community in the South.\r\n  That negro agents are building well is indicated by their success\r\n  in influencing the construction of 569 new houses, the remodeling\r\n  of 1,002 old houses, and the beautification of 1,336 home grounds\r\n  during 1924.\r\n]\r\n\r\nIn most parts of the Cotton Belt it has been possible during the last\r\nfew years for farmers to make a good living and to make a profit\r\nbesides. The migration to the North has perceptibly slackened, and\r\nthousands of negroes who have been getting good wages as carpenters,\r\nbricklayers, mechanics, and other artisans in near-by and distant\r\ncities are saving money to buy land. Many of them left their families\r\nat home and are sending them money for their support and for building\r\nsavings accounts to be used in buying a farm home. (Fig. 1.) Of\r\ncourse, a large percentage will remain in the industrial centers of\r\nthe North, but the negro’s love for his folks and for the soil will\r\ninfluence many to begin payments on farms at a time when wages are\r\nhigh and when such crops as cotton, tobacco, and peanuts are bringing\r\ngood prices. Negroes, as a rule, know how to grow the cash crops, and\r\nit has been found in many sections that negroes succeed with poultry,\r\ntruck, dairying, and other diversified interests when they own their\r\nown small farms.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 2.—Field demonstration in cultivating cotton. The\r\nnegro is naturally a farmer and takes a keen interest in putting to\r\nuse the better practices learned at demonstration meetings.]\r\n\r\nBecause of the inevitable economic changes resulting from the World\r\nWar, many large plantations have been cut up and sold at low prices.\r\nIn some sections of the South, chambers of commerce and other\r\nbusiness organizations have been promoting campaigns to encourage\r\nnegroes to become landowners. In 1920 about 217,500 negroes in the\r\nSouthern States owned their farms and about 703,500 were tenants. In\r\nsome States negroes have been buying farms faster than white people,\r\nand the rapid increase of ownership during the last five years is\r\nmost noticeable. It is not surprising that it has taken a backward\r\nrace a long time to acquire property and develop farms. It takes\r\nwhite agricultural college graduates quite a while to do that. The\r\nnext 25 years unquestionably will witness a marked contrast to the\r\nfirst quarter of the century in this regard. It is well that the\r\ndevelopment is taking place along the lines of the negro’s training\r\nand disposition. All of this confirms the judgment of Booker T.\r\nWashington, the negro educator, who said:\r\n\r\n  The negro is, in my opinion, naturally a farmer, and he is at his\r\n  very best when he is in close contact with the soil. (Fig. 2.)\r\n  There is something in the atmosphere of the farm that develops\r\n  and strengthens the negro’s natural common sense. As a rule, the\r\n  negro farmer has a rare gift of getting at the sense of things\r\n  and of stating in picturesque language what he has learned. The\r\n  explanation of it is, it seems to me, that the negro farmer studies\r\n  nature. In his own way he studies the soil, the development of\r\n  plants and animals, the streams, the birds and the changes of the\r\n  seasons. He has a chance of getting at first-hand the kind of\r\n  knowledge that is valuable to him.\r\n\r\nDuring the last few years many persons from different parts of Africa\r\nhave visited this country to study our methods of industrial and\r\nagricultural education. Some of them have been Government officials,\r\nsome teachers in schools and colleges, and some missionaries. They\r\nrepresented many different nationalities, all of which are interested\r\nin the welfare of dark-skinned people. Such visitors are always\r\ninterested in Hampton and Tuskegee Institutes and usually have a\r\nscholastic point of view when they arrive. On their return, however,\r\nthey are always enthusiastic about the men and women extension agents\r\nwhose primary responsibility is to reach the farm and home. They see\r\ngreater significance in demonstrations which proceed from the farm\r\nand home to the school than they do in those which go from the school\r\nto the farm. They seem to realize that the home is the fundamental\r\nunit of civilization and that the agents are the apostles of a\r\nbetter farm and home life, and therefore return to their work with\r\nan optimistic determination to encourage demonstration work in their\r\ncountries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDEVELOPMENT OF NEGRO EXTENSION WORK\r\n\r\n\r\nEARLY HISTORY\r\n\r\nFarmers’ cooperative demonstration work was begun in 1903. At first,\r\nall demonstration agents were white men and women. They enrolled\r\nnegro demonstrators who followed instructions so faithfully and\r\ncarefully that they were often more successful than white farmers and\r\nhome makers. Many instances were reported of negro farmers who got\r\nstarted along the pathway of success because of the stimulation of\r\nsuch demonstrations. County agricultural agents often reported that\r\n25 per cent of their demonstrators were negroes and that many negroes\r\nattended the field meetings and public demonstrations.\r\n\r\nBooker T. Washington had a prominent part in beginning negro\r\nextension work in the South. Tuskegee Institute, which he founded in\r\nAlabama, already had carried instruction to negro farmers through\r\nits faculty, through farm conferences at Tuskegee and in local\r\ncommunities, and through printed bulletins. Doctor Washington also\r\nused a “Jesup wagon,” provided with agricultural equipment to go out\r\namong farmers and demonstrate better farming methods. Washington,\r\nH. B. Frissell, of Hampton Institute, Va., and Seaman A. Knapp of\r\nthe United States Department of Agriculture, worked out the relation\r\nof Hampton and Tuskegee Institutes with the department and made\r\narrangements for the appointment in 1906 of T. M. Campbell, of\r\nTuskegee Institute, the first negro demonstration agent, and of J. B.\r\nPierce, of Hampton Institute, a few days later.\r\n\r\nIn speaking of extension work a few years afterwards, Washington said:\r\n\r\n  It would be impossible to describe here all the ramifications or\r\n  all the various forms which this extension work has taken in recent\r\n  years. The thing that I wish to emphasize, however, is that we are\r\n  seeking in this work less to teach (according to the old-fashioned\r\n  notion of teaching) than to improve conditions.\r\n\r\nHis was a spirit of service. In the same connection he expressed in\r\nthe following excerpt an unusual and unique opinion of the pedagogy\r\nof extension work. His experience and his observations constitute a\r\ngreat inspiration for negro extension agents and educators generally.\r\n\r\n  I have sometimes regarded it as a fortunate circumstance that I\r\n  never studied pedagogy. If I had done so, every time I attempted\r\n  to do anything in a new way I should have felt compelled to reckon\r\n  with all the past, and in my case that would have taken so much\r\n  time that I should never have got anywhere. As it was, I was\r\n  perfectly free to go ahead and do whatever seemed necessary at the\r\n  time, without reference to whether that same thing had ever been\r\n  done by anyone else at any previous time or not.\r\n\r\nGeneral Armstrong, who founded Hampton Institute in Virginia for\r\nNegroes and Indians in the reconstruction days immediately following\r\nthe Civil War, expressed somewhat the same idea when he said:\r\n\r\n  Many teachers seem to me to have disproportionate ideas of the\r\n  forces that make up man. * * * There is plenty of study of methods\r\n  and not enough study of men or of the problems of life.\r\n\r\nNegro home demonstration work was also developed through the interest\r\nand aid of white agents. White supervisory agents still take\r\nsympathetic interest in negro extension activities. In view of the\r\nfact that negro women and girls had always done much of the domestic\r\nlabor in southern homes and because negro schools and colleges had\r\ngiven courses in home economics, home demonstration work for negroes\r\nwas started in the best possible environment and atmosphere. Many\r\nwhite home demonstration agents and demonstrators took pleasure in\r\ngiving instruction in gardening, canning, and preserving to negro\r\nwomen and girls whom they knew. But, as the work developed, it soon\r\nbecame apparent that negro women agents could get access to negro\r\nhomes better than anybody else, so negro home demonstration agents\r\nbegan to be appointed. Annie Peters, of Boley, Okla., was appointed\r\non January 23, 1912, as the first negro home demonstration agent, and\r\nMattie Holmes, of Hampton Institute, Va., on May 24, 1912, as the\r\nsecond. Other appointments followed rapidly.\r\n\r\nIt has been possible to build up an extension organization in the\r\nSouth for negro people, because of such institutions as Hampton and\r\nTuskegee. In fact, the influence of these two major institutions has\r\naffected all the schools and colleges where negro agents have been\r\neducated. Many smaller similar institutions have also contributed\r\nmuch to extension work. Table 1 gives the percentage of negro men and\r\nwomen extension agents who were graduated from Tuskegee and Hampton\r\nInstitutes and from the State agricultural colleges.\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLE 1.—_Percentage of negro extension agents who are college\r\ngraduates_\r\n\r\n  —————————————————————————————————————+——————————————+———————————\r\n               Institution             |     Men      |    Women\r\n  —————————————————————————————————————+——————————————+———————————\r\n                                       | _Percentage_ | _Percentage_\r\n  Hampton Institute                    |       7.50   |       5.40\r\n  Tuskegee Institute                   |      10.16   |       5.40\r\n  State agricultural college           |       9.09   |       2.70\r\n                                       +——————————————+———————————\r\n      Graduates of the three combined  |      26.75   |      13.50\r\n  —————————————————————————————————————+——————————————+———————————\r\n\r\nIn beginning farm and home demonstration work for negroes in 1906,\r\nthe cooperation of the General Education Board of New York was most\r\nvaluable and effective. The board was liberal in its appropriations\r\nand generous in the arrangements for the expenditure of them. The\r\nmoney was turned over to the authorities of the United States\r\nDepartment of Agriculture to be used as they thought best in starting\r\nand promoting the work. It was because of the demonstrated success\r\nof this plan of education that the National, State, and county\r\nauthorities were more disposed to support it.\r\n\r\nWhen it is realized that various Southern States are gradually\r\nincreasing the appropriations to the State agricultural colleges,\r\nand also that a $9,000,000 endowment fund for Hampton and Tuskegee\r\nis being completed, it is possible to look forward to better-trained\r\nnegro agents. Progress can be faster now because the way is clear.\r\nEvery Southern State now has a group of efficient negro agents, whose\r\nnumbers are increasing. (Fig. 3.)\r\n\r\nIn view of the facts that Booker T. Washington gave the credit\r\nfor his own success to the influence General Armstrong had over\r\nhis life and that Tuskegee Institute is an extension and modified\r\nenlargement of Hampton Institute, it is well to trace a further\r\ndevelopment of such teaching and also to get the observation of\r\nthe recognized leaders. Long before the World War and before the\r\nmigration of negroes to the North, Booker T. Washington saw the South\r\nas the permanent home of his people and he urged them to develop the\r\nresources of climate, soil, forests, and folks. He saw conditions\r\nclearly and urged his people to train for skill, to practice thrift,\r\nand to grow better by doing better. This was the best of preparation\r\nfor the negro agency force now in the field.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 3.—Virginia negro extension agents assembled at annual\r\n  meeting. This group is typical of the efficient negro extension\r\n  agents throughout the South who, with vision and good judgment,\r\n  are influencing negroes to follow the best methods of farming and\r\n  home making in order to increase their earning capacity and improve\r\n  their living conditions.\r\n]\r\n\r\nIn the first farmers’ conference at Tuskegee in February, 1892,\r\nwhich, by the way, was the forerunner of farm congresses at\r\nagricultural colleges for white people in various parts of\r\nthe country, the following resolution, among other important\r\ndeliverances, was adopted:\r\n\r\n  In view of our general condition, we would suggest the following\r\n  remedies: (1) That as far as possible we aim to raise at home our\r\n  own meat and bread; (2) that as fast as possible we buy land,\r\n  even though a very few acres at a time; (3) that a larger number\r\n  of our young people be taught trades, and that they be urged to\r\n  prepare themselves to enter as largely as possible all the various\r\n  vocations of life; (4) that we especially try to broaden the\r\n  field of labor for our women; (5) that we make every sacrifice\r\n  and practice every form of economy that we may purchase land and\r\n  free ourselves from our burdensome habit of living in debt; (6)\r\n  that we urge our ministers and teachers to give more attention to\r\n  the material condition and home life of the people; (7) that we\r\n  urge our people not to depend entirely upon the State to provide\r\n  schoolhouses and lengthen the time of the schools, but to take\r\n  hold of the matter themselves where the State leaves off, and\r\n  by supplementing the public funds from their own pockets and by\r\n  building schoolhouses, bring about the desired results; (8) that\r\n  we urge patrons to give earnest attention to the mental and moral\r\n  fitness of those who teach their schools; (9) that we urge the\r\n  doing away with all sectarian prejudice in the management of the\r\n  schools.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nORDER OF DEVELOPMENT\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 4.—Negro county agricultural agent helping a farmer to select\r\n  fattening hogs. Negro farmers desire helpful information on\r\n  specific things that can be put into immediate use with noticeable\r\n  results. In this respect, demonstration activities have rendered a\r\n  valuable service in meeting their needs.\r\n]\r\n\r\nIt has been extension experience that negroes are especially\r\nresponsive to the demonstration method, because of their faith,\r\nconfidence, and optimism. Demonstrations have reached the most\r\nignorant and most needy better than any form of academic instruction,\r\nbecause demonstrators must be doers before they become teachers.\r\nThe effect and power of a demonstration are measured by the\r\nsuccess of the enterprise and the standing and influence of the\r\ndemonstrator. The demonstration method has proved to be not only\r\nthe best for the ignorant, but also for the intelligent. Certainly\r\nthe more intelligent farmers can carry object lessons further than\r\nthe ignorant ones. Furthermore, it is safe to assume a fair amount\r\nof good farm and home development in an intelligent, prosperous\r\ncommunity. Perhaps one reason why farmers tire of institutes and\r\nlectures is because they feel that they have reached a stage of\r\nknowledge where they can do things fairly well and have thus become\r\nteachers and leaders themselves. They do not care to accumulate a\r\nlot of information upon diverse subjects just for the purpose of\r\nacquiring information. They want usable knowledge upon specific\r\nthings. (Fig. 4.) The negro has made sufficient progress for\r\nextension agents to find men, women, boys, and girls in every\r\ncommunity who can demonstrate better farming and home making.\r\n\r\nThe history of extension work for negroes has not been exactly\r\nparallel to that of the whites in the Southern States. The white\r\nagents started work with men demonstrators, followed in succession\r\nby boys, girls, and women. Negro work started with men and women\r\nfirst. The agents tried to meet the most urgent needs of the farms\r\nand homes. At the time when the Department of Agriculture and State\r\nagricultural colleges first began to appoint negro agents, the club\r\nwork of white boys and girls had drifted somewhat away from the\r\ndemonstration feature and was emphasizing the club feature. When the\r\nnegro agents began later to enroll boys and girls they did so because\r\nthey felt that these young folks should have an influence in farming\r\nand in home making in their communities. It was not so much a matter\r\nof teaching and telling as it was of doing and growing. One agent\r\nexpressed it by saying, “We are emphasizing work rather than clubs.”\r\nOf course, in the natural process of evolution, agents came to pay\r\nmore attention to meetings, organization, recreation, and group\r\nactivities in general, but the central theme is the demonstration.\r\n\r\nNegro club members have manifested a disposition for the boy to do\r\nthe farming and the girl the home making. That tendency is general in\r\nall extension work, of course, but the line of differentiation has\r\nnot been so clear in adult activities. Because of the limited funds\r\navailable, few counties have been able to afford both negro men and\r\nwomen agents. Thus it comes about that the men agents do more home\r\nwork and the women agents more farm work than in counties employing\r\nboth county agricultural and home demonstration agents. As time goes\r\non and more agents are appointed, this matter will adjust itself.\r\n\r\nDuring the present period of readjustment and reconstruction it\r\nis becoming more and more apparent to students of extension work\r\nthat the greatest ultimate reform will take place where the most\r\nsuccessful demonstration of content and size are conducted and\r\nwhere such demonstrations are multiplied in the greatest numbers.\r\nMany negro agents seem to have the ability to encourage their\r\ndemonstrators and magnify the influence of their work. They have\r\ncaught the philosophy of the founder of demonstration work, Seaman A.\r\nKnapp, when he said, “Your value lies not in what you can do but in\r\nwhat you can get other people to do.” Negro agents seem to appreciate\r\nthe standing in the community of a man or woman who has done better\r\nwork than anybody else. They enter into the thought and life of the\r\ndemonstrator who estimated that more than 50 men in his neighborhood\r\nhad been influenced by his success with 10 acres of cotton along the\r\nroadside. They know that the boy who said, “My club acre has been\r\nnoticed by many people in this section and I am sure it will cause\r\nsome of my boy friends to join the club next year,” had developed in\r\nhimself the real spirit of service. They appreciate the feeling of\r\npride and satisfaction that came to the girl club member who raised a\r\ndairy calf, built a good house for it, and then saw more than a dozen\r\nlike it built within a radius of 5 miles of her home. (Fig. 5.) The\r\nresult has been to make each person carrying on a demonstration feel\r\nthat he has a responsibility as a leader and teacher in his community.\r\n\r\nThe culminating evidence of these efforts toward improvement through\r\nthe object-lesson method is found in the results obtained in home and\r\nlawn beautification. Particularly in recent years negro extension\r\nagents have brought about marked progress in the renovation,\r\npainting, and whitewashing of houses and outbuildings, and in the\r\ngrowing of flowers, grass, and shrubbery in the front yards.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVALUE OF COOPERATIVE ASSOCIATIONS\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 5.—Negro club member who made sufficient profit from the\r\n  sale of butter and buttermilk to pay her way through Tuskegee\r\n  Institute. The benefits which accrued through her club activities\r\n  were far-reaching in that her neighbors and friends were inspired\r\n  to follow the best dairy practices in an effort to emulate her\r\n  successful results.\r\n]\r\n\r\nNegro farmers have manifested considerable interest in cooperative\r\nmarketing. They belong to cotton, tobacco, peanut, potato, and\r\nsimilar associations. They usually follow carefully instructions\r\nin grading and standardization. They appreciate the opportunity of\r\npurchasing fertilizers and other supplies through the farm bureau and\r\nother organizations engaged in such enterprises. In some counties\r\nwhere associations have given special attention to marketing carloads\r\nof hogs, chickens, potatoes, pecans, and other products produced in\r\nsurplus quantities, the negroes do their share. It has come about\r\nthat most marketing plans which have been developed include negroes\r\nin their operations better than any other form of productive and\r\neducational enterprise. In cooperative-marketing associations the\r\ncommodity is considered rather than the person or the community.\r\nClarendon County, S. C., is a very good example of such development.\r\nThe market bureau, which was established at the suggestion of the\r\ncounty agricultural agent and which is conducted largely under his\r\ndirection and guidance, has the names of more than 700 negroes\r\non its mailing list. These negroes have cooperated not only by\r\nshipping potatoes, hogs, peanuts, chickens, and other commodities,\r\nbut by procuring better seed and stock in order to grow products of\r\nbetter quality for shipment. As this work develops in any community\r\nit gradually brings about a general improvement. It begins with\r\nindividuals but always influences the entire community. (Fig. 6.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 6.—A demonstration of home conveniences designed to lighten\r\n  the labor of the negro home maker and allow her more time for\r\n  self-improvement and recreation. Such demonstrations by local men\r\n  or women have stimulated the adoption of good practices and have\r\n  done much to bring about a general community improvement.]\r\n\r\nSuch cooperation has increased self-respect and has strengthened\r\nmutual confidence. This activity has emphasized the fact that men and\r\nwomen limited in ambition and will power may be greatly stimulated to\r\nsuccessful effort by the esteem and encouragement of their neighbors.\r\nThe county agricultural agent of Clarendon County reported that every\r\nnegro farmer in his county knows No. 1, No. 2, and Jumbo potatoes. He\r\nalso reported that they are striving to produce No. 1’s because they\r\nrealize that products of such quality will receive the commendation\r\nof everybody concerned and also will bring in larger returns. This\r\nrealization of the value of superior products has brought about a\r\ngreat improvement in the type of chickens, pigs, and other farm\r\nanimals raised for market.\r\n\r\nMarketing has tended to unify and systematize extension organization\r\nin the counties more than any other work that has been done thus far.\r\nIt has enlisted the active interest of all farmers, both white and\r\ncolored, and of local business men. Some of the counties which will\r\nhave full quotas of both white and colored extension agents, and\r\ngood representative working organizations are developing extension\r\nprograms to a fuller degree than has been possible heretofore. It\r\nis an enormous task to change the customs and habits of centuries\r\nor even of decades. Negroes who have grown practically nothing but\r\ncotton are slow to become dairymen, poultrymen, and truckers. They\r\nchange mainly because of economic necessity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEVOLUTION OF PLAN\r\n\r\n\r\nThe evolution of an agricultural plan of work among negroes,\r\nin a general way, followed that of the whites. It began with\r\ndemonstrations in the improvement of staple crops and then proceeded\r\nstep by step into crop diversification, animal husbandry, and\r\nconservation. The whole development may be briefly expressed as\r\nfollows: Crop production, livestock production, soil building, and\r\nmarketing. Fortunately, this program is so logical and so appropriate\r\nthat demonstrators and club members are naturally disposed to follow\r\nit. This does not mean that they all do the same things at the\r\nsame time. In livestock activities, one group may be emphasizing\r\ndairy cattle and another hogs. The retroactive influence upon crop\r\nproduction in one direction and soil improvement in another is very\r\npotent. Seaman A. Knapp evidently had this whole evolution in mind,\r\nand he was familiar with the work among negroes, when he told the\r\nagents not to go before the people with elaborate programs. He said:\r\n“The average man, like the crow, can not count more than three. Do\r\nthe next thing.” General Armstrong was dealing with the same people\r\nand, to some extent, with the same thought when he said, “I try to\r\nget at bottom facts, and then take the next step.”\r\n\r\nA general agricultural plan of work, of course, is applicable\r\neverywhere at any time. It is flexible, and requires individual\r\ninitiative and resourcefulness. The more experienced farmers and\r\nclub boys will be in the advanced stages while the novices will be\r\ntaking the first step. The whole procedure goes forward in cycles. As\r\neach cycle comes around, modification and adaptation take place in\r\naccordance with the progress science has made in the meantime. For\r\ninstance, in corn demonstrations in most parts of the South, where,\r\nin former years, farmers planted one-ear varieties, they are now\r\nusing prolific varieties, especially where interplantings of peas and\r\nbeans and where hogging down and grazing are to be done.\r\n\r\nThe Alabama Agricultural Experiment Station recently came to the\r\nconclusion that vetch is the best winter legume for most of the soils\r\nin Alabama. Thousands of negro farmers have accepted that instruction\r\nand are using vetch as a winter legume and soil improver. The negro\r\nfarmers have also accepted the teachings of the experiment station in\r\nregard to the kinds and quantities of fertilizers to be used.\r\n\r\nThe negro home program also has been developed through certain\r\nlogical processes, which may be indicated briefly as follows:\r\nProduction, utilization, construction, and beautification. This,\r\ntoo, is a natural program which may be followed consciously and\r\nintuitively by every person who is properly started in the work.\r\nThe negro women and girls commence with growing vegetables in the\r\ngardens, beginning with the most needed food crops and enlarging\r\ntheir operations gradually. Then they undertake to conserve enough\r\nfor home use during the winter. They sell the surplus vegetables,\r\nboth fresh and canned. It is an easy step from canning vegetables to\r\nthe preservation of fruits. Better bread comes next because of its\r\nimportance as food and because flour, meal, and grains in general are\r\navailable. Then eggs and butter are standardized, and poultry meat\r\nis properly cooked and canned. Such activities, in turn, stimulate\r\nbetter work with pork, beef, and other meats.\r\n\r\nSuccess in such enterprises suggests and encourages home improvement,\r\ninvolving demonstrations in rearranging kitchens, living rooms,\r\nand homes in general. Better furniture is procured and paint and\r\nwhitewash are in demand. Demonstrations with textiles and fabrics\r\nare considered incidentally all along. The girls and women want\r\nsimple neat dresses in their work. The club idea suggests uniforms\r\nfor public demonstrations and meetings. In hundreds of instances the\r\nprogram culminates with an attractive new home in a setting of trees,\r\nshrubbery, and flowers. Such a self-developed program, the germs of\r\nwhich exist in the plans and hopes of the people who are actually\r\ndoing the work on the farms and in the homes, is infinitely more\r\nimportant than one developed for them.\r\n\r\nIt is fortunate that negro extension work started with demonstrations\r\nby individual farmers instead of with organization for instruction\r\npurposes. Organization arose spontaneously. People who did the same\r\nkind of work in the same way were easily organized. Negro farmers\r\nand members of their families who had the same kind of poultry,\r\nfor instance, and who built the same kind of houses, were brought\r\ntogether for mutual stimulation, help, and instruction. Every farmer\r\nwho had an object lesson in growing vetch, soy beans, velvet beans,\r\nor peanuts was glad to join a tour to see similar activities on farms\r\nin other parts of his county. Field meetings, tours, camps, and short\r\ncourses have the elements and principles of organization within\r\nthem. They constitute a focus or converging point for activities\r\nthat are mutual. If the white agents who did negro work in the\r\nbeginning or the negro agents who took it up later had proceeded on\r\nan organization basis first, the whole proposition would have been\r\nmisunderstood by both white and colored people.\r\n\r\nObservation of the experience of the people who made negro extension\r\nwork possible and its success notable, naturally calls attention to\r\nthe elementary methods which have been used. The various processes\r\nmay be stated in a half dozen words: Consultation, demonstration,\r\nemulation, publication, organization, and multiplication. Whether the\r\nagents are working with the approximately 217,500 negroes who own\r\ntheir own farms or with the 703,500 who are tenants, deliberation,\r\nconference, and good judgment are required to establish the work\r\nwithout creating friction. In the pioneer counties, where the\r\ndemonstrations were most successful, the introduction was done in\r\na quiet way. The general public did not know much about it until\r\ngood object lessons in crop production were available, and nothing\r\nprevents or stops criticism so readily as successful demonstrations.\r\nIf the demonstrators have been carefully selected, if they are men\r\nwhose conduct has been exemplary, the conviction is all the stronger.\r\n\r\nThe first negro demonstrators were proud to wear the button furnished\r\nby the Department of Agriculture containing the word “Demonstrator.”\r\nThese buttons were often given out in churches as awards of merit and\r\ndistinction. Negroes are very susceptible to commendation and praise.\r\nIt means a lot to a man, woman, boy, or girl, who has started out\r\non a demonstration program, to receive recognition from his pastor,\r\nhis neighbors, and especially from the leading white citizens.\r\nWhenever a county paper calls attention to the outstanding results\r\nobtained by a negro farmer, he immediately measures up to the added\r\nresponsibility and goes forward on the path of improvement. Whenever\r\nthere is a considerable number of demonstrators of that kind, it is\r\nsafe to do organization work along agricultural and home-economics\r\nlines. In fact, negroes who have demonstrated that kind of enterprise\r\nand dependability are ready for cooperative marketing or other\r\nwelfare organization. The great task that is before the negro\r\nextension force is to multiply the numbers of good demonstrators.\r\nIn this way, they will develop leaders and magnify the kind of\r\nactivities which will meet with universal approval.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGROWTH OF PERSONNEL AND FINANCES[1]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe gradual increase in the number of negro agents and also in the\r\nappropriations for their support during the last 10 years gives much\r\npromise for the development of this work in the future. On June\r\n30, 1915, the end of the first year under the Smith-Lever Act, 49\r\nnegro men agents and 17 women agents were employed, and the total\r\ncost of the work during the year was $31,589. In 1919, 459 negro\r\nmen and women agents were employed and the cost was $247,509. On\r\nJune 30, 1924, the end of the first decade under the Smith-Lever\r\nAct, 299 agents were employed, of whom 191 were men and 108, women.\r\nThe total amount expended during the fiscal year 1924 was $426,266,\r\nwhich was derived from Federal, State, and county sources, and which\r\nrepresented the peak in the amount of money devoted to this work.\r\nMore agents were employed during the war period, but many of them\r\ndevoted only part time to extension work. All things considered,\r\ntherefore, negro extension work is making steady and substantial\r\nprogress every year.\r\n\r\nFrom Table 3, page 28, it will be noted that the increase in the\r\nnumber of negro extension agents and in the cost of maintaining\r\nthem went forward in two distinct stages during the 10-year period\r\nimmediately following the enactment of the Smith-Lever Act. The\r\nnumber of agents and the number of club members increased very\r\nrapidly during the World War, which was followed by a period of\r\nunrest and transition. After that came a settling down and then an\r\nera of solid and substantial development. There has been a gradual\r\nand steady increase in the amount of money devoted to negro extension\r\nwork. Although it is true that not so many agents were on duty in\r\n1924 as in 1919, yet more than four times as many were employed in\r\n1924 as in 1915. Furthermore, the finances had increased more than a\r\ndozenfold. This indicates a better-trained class of negro agents and\r\na greater public willingness to support negro extension work.\r\n\r\nTexas, which receives more Federal money than any other State,\r\nhad 36 negro agents in 1924 and spent $55,424 for their salaries,\r\ntravel, and other necessary expenses. Alabama had 34 negro agents,\r\nmen and women, and $50,057 was spent in the maintenance of their\r\nwork. Mississippi had 36 agents and the cost was $48,876. Virginia\r\nhad a total of 34 agents and the cost of maintaining this force\r\nwas $44,787. Georgia had 26 agents and expended $30,452. Several\r\nother States have a large agency force and the financial support is\r\nbecoming more and more liberal.\r\n\r\nThe percentage of negroes to whites is different in each of the\r\nSouthern States and this fact would be taken into consideration\r\nin any study of appropriations for negro work. At the last\r\ncensus, Georgia had 1,689,114 white people and 1,206,365 negroes;\r\nMississippi, 853,962 whites and 935,184 negroes; Alabama, 1,447,032\r\nwhites and 900,652 negroes; South Carolina, 818,538 whites and\r\n864,719 negroes; North Carolina, 1,783,779 whites and 763,407\r\nnegroes; Texas, 3,918,165 whites and 741,694 negroes; Virginia,\r\n1,617,909 whites and 690,017 negroes; and Oklahoma, 1,821,194 whites\r\nand 149,408 negroes.\r\n\r\nIt will be observed from Table 3 that practically all of the States\r\nwhich took up negro extension work first have the greatest financial\r\nsupport and the largest number of agents in proportion to their negro\r\npopulation. Alabama and Virginia appointed their first negro agents\r\nin 1906; Mississippi, in 1908; Georgia and South Carolina, in 1909;\r\nOklahoma, in 1910; North Carolina, in 1911; and the other States in\r\nrapid succession.\r\n\r\nIt is greatly to the credit of the pioneer agents that their work has\r\nmet with the approval of county commissioners, boards of education,\r\nand public authorities generally. Nothing is quite so encouraging\r\nabout the whole development as the wholesome public sentiment which\r\nhas sustained the work and encouraged the agents. This support is\r\nbased upon knowledge of good work done and results achieved. A large\r\nmetropolitan daily paper, speaking of the present work of the man who\r\nwas the first negro agent appointed by the United States Department\r\nof Agriculture, said:\r\n\r\n  His principal duties are to see that negro county agricultural\r\n  agents obtain outline maps of each county and properly distribute\r\n  the work; that at least one house in each county is built at\r\n  stated intervals according to an approved plan; that one or more\r\n  electric lighting systems be undertaken in the county; that at\r\n  least one house be whitewashed or painted in each demonstration\r\n  community; that one or more water systems be undertaken in each\r\n  county; that at least one farmstead home grounds be developed in\r\n  each community; that at least one sanitary toilet be constructed\r\n  in each demonstration community; that at least one crop-rotation\r\n  demonstration be given; that one or more permanent pastures be\r\n  established; that at least one person in each community be taught\r\n  the use of the farm level; that one year-round garden demonstration\r\n  be established; that at least one farm be properly laid out\r\n  or plotted in each county; that one playground be equipped in\r\n  each community; and that one or more demonstration orchards be\r\n  established in each county.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] Funds for cooperative extension work are appropriated for fiscal\r\nyears ending on June 30, whereas extension agents are required to\r\nprepare their reports for calendar years. For this reason, statements\r\nof funds appearing in this section and in Table 3 are for fiscal\r\nyears ended on June 30, and statistics of demonstration results\r\nappearing in a following section are for the calendar year ended Dec.\r\n31, 1924.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCOOPERATION WITH OTHER AGENCIES\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom several years’ experience it has been found that negro agents\r\ncooperate closely with their schools and churches. Negro preachers\r\nhave great power and influence among their people, not only in\r\nmatters of religion, but also in farming and home making. Wherever an\r\nagent obtains the indorsement of a negro pastor, and also gets this\r\npastor to do some good farming and make his home more attractive,\r\nhe gets assistance that is impossible to obtain from any other\r\nsource. A negro industrial school in a county is usually a center of\r\ninfluence in extension work as well as in public service generally.\r\nSuch a school reenforces the instruction given by the agents and is a\r\ngathering place for demonstrators and club members. The demonstration\r\nactivities improve and enhance the school work to a considerable\r\ndegree.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the cooperation given by churches and schools, many\r\norganizations have assisted negro extension agents in carrying\r\nout local extension programs. Much assistance in this respect has\r\nbeen accorded by vocational educational workers, negro chambers\r\nof commerce, lodges, health societies, negro farmers’ unions,\r\nfederations of women’s clubs, and others.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCLUB WORK BY NEGRO BOYS AND GIRLS\r\n\r\n\r\nAs has already been indicated, 4-H club work among negro boys and\r\ngirls has been a secondary development, but it is now going forward\r\nby leaps and bounds. The work by negro agents among adult negroes was\r\njust getting well started when the Smith-Lever Act was passed. The\r\neffect of the act and of the increase of funds resulting from it was\r\nto strengthen and reenforce what was being done for negro farmers and\r\nhome makers. As was to be expected, the boys and girls soon wanted\r\nto follow in the footsteps of their fathers and mothers. (Fig. 7.)\r\nThere are excellent prospects for junior extension work in the near\r\nfuture. In fact, negro boys and girls have been making records that\r\nare stimulating white club members to greater effort and endeavor.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 7.—This negro club boy is learning seed-corn\r\nselection from his county agricultural agent.]\r\n\r\nAt the close of the 10-year period there was a total enrollment in\r\n4-H club work in the Southern States of 21,721 negro boys and 27,114\r\nnegro girls. These figures show a big increase since 1916, when the\r\nenrollment of 2,551 negro club members was first recorded separately.\r\nAt that time the State club agents suggested that negro boys should\r\nbe organized into farm-makers’ clubs and negro girls into homemakers’\r\nclubs. Prior to that time many negro boys and girls were enrolled in\r\n4-H clubs, but they did not have such different classification as to\r\nmake their work stand out and receive proper emphasis and recognition.\r\n\r\nThe end of the 10-year period also found a great many negro boys and\r\ngirls demonstrating to their parents, their neighbors, and the world\r\nthat they can clear $200 to $300 a year on their club enterprises\r\nand at the same time keep up regular attendance at school during the\r\nterm provided for them by their respective counties and States. A\r\n14-year-old boy or girl who can put $100 or more into a bank and\r\ncontinue saving each year as he or she grows older is assured of an\r\neducation and a start in life. This gives the younger generation a\r\nbig advantage and also furnishes a great inspiration to the agents\r\nwho are working among these people. More work of this kind will\r\nresult in considerable advance on the part of the younger generation\r\nof negroes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MOVABLE SCHOOL\r\n\r\n\r\nA development peculiar to negro extension work is the movable school.\r\nThis is an automobile truck carrying equipment for demonstrations\r\nand accompanied by an automobile conveying instructors. (Fig. 8.)\r\nThe equipment consists of farm and home tools and utensils necessary\r\nto illustrate better methods of farming and home making. The school\r\ngoes to a home where arrangements have already been made by the local\r\nagent, and stays from one to three days. The novelty of the outfit\r\nand the rather spectacular nature of the occasion guarantee a good\r\nattendance of people from the vicinity where the work is to be done.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 8.—Negro movable school which carries equipment and\r\n  instructors to local communities where the better ways of farming\r\n  and home making are demonstrated. Such movable schools have\r\n  supplemented the work of the local negro extension agent, who\r\n  follows up and impresses on the community the lessons brought out.]\r\n\r\nThe local agents and the instructors agree in advance upon what\r\nis to be done. The program includes such things as pruning trees,\r\nterracing land, plowing properly, building a chicken house, building\r\na sanitary privy, grading fruit, eggs, and vegetables, dressing\r\nchickens, making fireless cookers, canning, making work dresses and\r\naprons, and whitewashing or painting the house and outbuildings.\r\nThe people in attendance are divided into small groups and several\r\nenterprises are carried on at the same time. After the various jobs\r\nare completed, the whole crowd makes a tour of inspection and much\r\nincidental instruction is driven home by those in charge. In addition\r\nto having specialists in farming and home making, the school usually\r\ncarries a public-health nurse who gives much needed instruction and\r\ndemonstration. A necessary part of the equipment is a projector for\r\nshowing films and slides during meetings at the school or church.\r\nEquipment is also carried to facilitate games and play for a short\r\ntime every day after the regular work is done.\r\n\r\nIn view of the fact that much interest has been manifested in\r\nthe movable school, it may be desirable to consider it from a\r\nstrictly extension point of view. First, in the communities where\r\nthe negro population is densest and where their welfare has been\r\nmost neglected, more simple instruction and demonstration by the\r\nspecialists and agents themselves are necessary. Just as fast as the\r\nfarmers can make object lessons and assume leadership themselves,\r\njust so fast should that responsibility be passed on to them. Second,\r\nthe movable school supplements the work of the local agent and is\r\nsupplemented by it. When a home with its premises has been renovated\r\nand practically reconstructed by the visit of a movable school, and\r\nwhen the farmer and his family revolutionize their methods on the\r\nfarm, then the question arises as to how many more farmers can be\r\ninfluenced to do likewise. The movable school does much to lay out\r\nthe work of the agents, and if they do not follow up such work and\r\nimpress its lessons, then little benefit is derived. However, the\r\ninfluence can be measured more successfully a year after the visit of\r\nthe movable school than the day after.\r\n\r\nBy request of leading white citizens of Dallas County, Ala., the\r\nmovable school concentrated there for a month and covered the whole\r\ncounty. Many plantation owners, bankers, and business men visited the\r\nschool and saw it in action. Their commendation was most encouraging\r\nand inspires the hope that this enterprise may be used to facilitate\r\nthe reform and readjustment of farm and home life among negro farmers\r\nwho are to remain in the South and improve their conditions. A\r\nprominent English woman, who recently visited a movable school, was\r\nmost favorably impressed. Her only criticism was that it was liable\r\nto cause confusion because of the wealth of instruction given in so\r\nshort a time. She thought that the instruction included more than\r\ncould be assimilated and utilized in a week. She rather facetiously\r\nremarked that it would not surprise her if some of the women were to\r\ngo home and put their babies down in water glass and make “pinless\r\noutfits” for the eggs. Her observation still further confirmed\r\nthe belief that the movable school and the local agents should be\r\nmutually helpful.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSTORIES OF ACHIEVEMENT\r\n\r\n\r\nA few typical stories taken from numerous narratives of success\r\nquoted by negro extension agents will suffice to give trends and\r\ntendencies. Floyd Stokes, of Gloucester County, Va., told the\r\nfollowing story of the help given him through extension work (fig. 9):\r\n\r\n  When I got married back in 1903, I left home to begin life as a\r\n  renter. The little house to which I moved was on 3 acres of land\r\n  which I worked when not engaged in fishing or oystering. After\r\n  having lived on this place three years, a young man, the first\r\n  demonstration agent I had ever heard of, came to me and began\r\n  talking soil improvement and how I could make a living out of it.\r\n  Just about this time the agent induced me to buy 9 acres of land\r\n  near by which were for sale. Four of these acres had been cleared\r\n  and there was an old house on the land that had been used as a\r\n  barn. I sawed some timber, had some doors and windows made for the\r\n  barn, and moved into my own home.\r\n\r\n  Under the instruction of the agent I planted the 3 rented acres to\r\n  melons and sowed cowpeas between the rows at the last cultivation\r\n  to be turned under as green manure. This crop of melons netted\r\n  me $300. On the 4 cleared acres I began soil building and the\r\n  rotation of crops, as follows: In the spring I sowed cowpeas\r\n  for hay, followed by crimson clover, which was turned under the\r\n  following spring and planted to corn. Cowpeas were sown at the\r\n  last cultivation. A good crop of corn was produced the first year.\r\n  The cornland was planted to garden peas the next year, followed\r\n  by crimson clover to be turned under and by potatoes the year\r\n  following. The potatoes were followed by cowpeas, which were cut\r\n  for hay in the fall. In the meantime, I had cleared the other 5\r\n  acres on which I planted melons, followed by crimson clover to be\r\n  turned under for soil improvement.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 9.—Farm home and buildings of Floyd Stokes, of Gloucester\r\n  County, Va., an outstanding negro farmer who attributes his unusual\r\n  success to following the advice and suggestions of the negro\r\n  extension agent. ]\r\n\r\n  Back in the early days when I began work with the agent, my land\r\n  was very thin and light, being of a sandy texture; hence, it would\r\n  not produce over 15 bushels to the acre. By following closely the\r\n  system of crop rotation taught me, the same land is producing at\r\n  this time an average of 45 bushels of corn per acre and other crops\r\n  are doing equally well. From a sand bed, my land has been brought\r\n  to a high state of cultivation.\r\n\r\n  In the fourth year after I had bought my first 9 acres, I purchased\r\n  7 additional acres. From 1911 to 1917 I rented 13 acres adjoining\r\n  the 16 acres I owned. At the expiration of this period I succeeded\r\n  in buying this piece of land, paying cash for it at the rate of\r\n  $100 per acre. Two years later I bought 20 acres more for which\r\n  I paid $3,000 in cash, making my total holdings at this time 49\r\n  acres. The land on which my house stands cost me $800. I have since\r\n  been offered $6,000 for it. On the 20-acre plot is a good house\r\n  which I rent out, although the land is retained for my own use.\r\n\r\n  In 1923 I began to remodel my house. The necessary timber was cut\r\n  from the 20 acres purchased last. I planned to add all modern\r\n  conveniences to the house. A lighting system has been installed and\r\n  I plan to put in a complete water system next year. I have sheds\r\n  for housing the farm tools when not in use, and insist that they\r\n  be kept there. My net income averages around $2,000 per year. I\r\n  have sold $1,600 worth of green peas this season and just to-day\r\n  received $300 in small checks from neighboring farmers for seeds\r\n  and plants grown by me. My farm is self-supporting. I do not buy\r\n  anything that I can grow, and sell all surplus crops. I have eight\r\n  children, all of whom are being educated as fast as they are ready\r\n  for it. Two of my children are graduates of Hampton Institute.\r\n\r\n  I was one of the first to take up demonstration work in Gloucester\r\n  County and through it showed that money could be made out of\r\n  growing garden peas and other truck crops. Since most people at\r\n  that time were practicing fishing and oystering, no one believed\r\n  that truck gardening could be successful. When my success became\r\n  known, one after the other began to take it up until to-day\r\n  Gloucester County has become a great trucking center.\r\n\r\n  What success I have had in land buying, soil improvement, home\r\n  making, and education of my children may be credited to the\r\n  extension service through its agents who have rendered me most\r\n  valuable service for which I am deeply grateful.\r\n\r\nIn Gloucester County, Va., more than 90 per cent of the heads of\r\nnegro families own their own homes, the jail is usually empty, and\r\nthe courts have little to do.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 10.—Herschell Glenn, of Rockdale County, Ga., who made\r\n  a profit of over $265 through club work in 1924. (Photograph\r\n  furnished by Georgia Extension Service)\r\n]\r\n\r\nOne of the best records made in boys’ club work in 1924 was made by\r\nHerschell Glenn, of Rockdale County, Ga. (Fig. 10.) He made a profit\r\nof over $265 on his club work during the year and also had for his\r\nown use 15 bushels of corn and a pig weighing 200 pounds. He has\r\nhad the satisfaction of knowing that his good work has aroused and\r\ninspired hundreds of other boys in Georgia, including a large number\r\nin his own community and county, who will try to excel his record in\r\n1925. In reporting to his local agent he used the following simple\r\nand expressive language:\r\n\r\n  I had 2 acres in cotton. My total cost was $31.50; the total amount\r\n  of seed cotton, 3,150 pounds; total value of seeds and lint cotton,\r\n  $289.52; net profit, $265.85; and net profit per acre, $132.90.\r\n  My corn did not do so well. I only got 15 bushels from my acre. I\r\n  hope to do better next year. My pig is fine. I have fed her six\r\n  months. She weighs 200 pounds. I am proud to be a club boy and will\r\n  continue next year.\r\n\r\nA negro home demonstration agent in Wayne County, N. C., gave a\r\nvery good statement which indicates what is being done by negro\r\nwomen agents in changing home conditions. It will be noted that\r\nshe followed the desirable plan of putting other people forward to\r\ngive testimony and express the sentiments of her people. There is a\r\nfine recognition of individual effort and community cooperation in\r\nthis method of reporting which might well be commended to extension\r\nworkers generally.\r\n\r\n  I have been in the county two years and seven months. It is a\r\n  pleasure to note the improvement of the people along every line.\r\n  They eat better food, sleep in more fresh air, are happier at work,\r\n  take better care of their children, have higher ideals, and have\r\n  learned to sell the surplus food instead of wasting it and to buy\r\n  things which they need. More important than tangible results are\r\n  their changed ideas and attitude toward the work. One man speaking\r\n  at a community meeting said: “The agent has put new life into\r\n  dead bones. I feel better and am doing better and everybody in\r\n  the neighborhood is doing better whether he belongs to the club\r\n  or not.” In the same meeting a woman said: “I am 57 years of age,\r\n  have 20 children, 45 grandchildren, and 7 great grandchildren, but\r\n  have learned more in two years about caring for children, my home,\r\n  and health than I had learned in 55 years before. I have 7 milk\r\n  cows and 75 hens. I sell eggs, milk, butter, apples, peanuts, and a\r\n  few other little things and now I can see day breaking. I am just\r\n  learning how to live.”\r\n\r\nThe negro home demonstration agent of Autauga County, Ala., sketches\r\na general outline of progress which goes into a little more detail in\r\nregard to the various activities. She says:\r\n\r\n  Gardening is no longer a part-time project, but is carried on\r\n  through the year by both women and girls engaged in club work. We\r\n  have been able to keep vegetables the year round, even though we\r\n  have had a long dry spell. The number of insects and other pests,\r\n  such as worms and plant lice, have been kept down by the constant\r\n  use of soapsuds and wood ashes. Our winter gardens are doing fine.\r\n  I feel that beautifying the home and surroundings should get first\r\n  consideration, due to the fact that most of the time is spent in\r\n  the house. Homes have been whitewashed, yards cleaned, and flowers\r\n  planted in each case. Instructions have been given from time to\r\n  time in the care and handling of a cow and the care and handling\r\n  of milk in the home. Very few women are taking this instruction,\r\n  but these few are making and saving money. One separator and six\r\n  sanitary milk pails have been bought this year. We have worked hard\r\n  this year with poultry, trying to do away with scrubs and put in\r\n  more standard breeds. I have succeeded in getting 30 women and 5\r\n  girls to buy standard-bred eggs. As a result we have 1,300 more\r\n  standard-bred chickens this year than we had last year. Our aim is\r\n  to turn out 100 pullets on each yard.\r\n\r\nCanaan community in Montgomery County, Ala., furnishes a fine example\r\nof the ultimate objective of home demonstration work among negroes.\r\nIt is a good illustration of the fact that demonstrations are\r\nprogressive. When one step is taken and success is achieved, the very\r\nsituation is a stimulus to additional steps until the whole home and\r\nits environment become an inspiring object lesson of better living.\r\nThe following story indicates that practically all the homes in that\r\ncommunity are in various stages of advancement in extension work:\r\n\r\n  Almost every house in Canaan community shows signs of effort in\r\n  home improvement, and the demonstration home of this community is\r\n  now in process of development. The house has been remodeled and\r\n  the interior decoration completed. Plans for the yards, walls,\r\n  and fences are under way. This community also leads in bedspread\r\n  making, having 15 finished bedspreads. It is the plan of the agent\r\n  to have one demonstration home complete in each community where\r\n  demonstration work is carried on. The Smothers’ home at Mount Meigs\r\n  is the best example of home improvement in Montgomery County. The\r\n  State agent and the landscape specialist, with the cooperation\r\n  of the county agricultural agent, laid off the walks, surveyed\r\n  the road, and planted the shrubs, flowers, and Bermuda grass. The\r\n  owner found that his two-room house was not in keeping with his\r\n  surroundings and so he decided to remodel. He and his wife left\r\n  the plans of the house entirely to the judgment of the State and\r\n  county home-demonstration agents and were satisfied with the plans\r\n  for an addition of three rooms, a kitchen, back porch, bathroom,\r\n  and an 8-foot L porch. The plans were executed by an architect at\r\n  Tuskegee Institute. The construction is now complete and as soon\r\n  as the plasterers are through, the furniture will be installed.\r\n  At the request of Mr. and Mrs. Smothers, the home-demonstration\r\n  agent helped in the selection of new furniture. The curtains and\r\n  draperies are being made by the club girls of Mount Meigs, and\r\n  girls of another community are framing appropriate pictures.\r\n\r\nThe following extract from the report of the home-demonstration agent\r\nof Washington County, Tex., is typical of the numerous examples of\r\ngood work accomplished by negro club girls:\r\n\r\n  Lena Williams, age 16, of Washington County, Tex., has learned to\r\n  can vegetables and make jelly and pickles so well that her services\r\n  are in great demand. This year, after attending to her work at\r\n  home and keeping up her club activities, Lena made a profit of $63\r\n  by canning for other people and even a greater profit from the\r\n  sale of some of her products, both canned and fresh. With this\r\n  money she bought a purebred Poland China pig, costing $10, and 12\r\n  purebred Rhode Island Red pullets and 1 cockerel, costing $14. Lena\r\n  also attributes her good fortune in having some good warm, tasty\r\n  apparel for school to her activity in canning, as she invested the\r\n  remaining $39 in clothes for school wear, and plans to start a bank\r\n  account from her investment in chickens and pigs.\r\n\r\nIt should be noted that any girl club member who makes the right\r\nstart in productive enterprises is almost sure to go ahead into other\r\nphases of better home making and self-improvement. It is therefore\r\nvery essential to make the proper start. The initial stage from the\r\nviewpoint of the demonstrator is most vital. The importance of the\r\nstarting point was emphasized by Seaman A. Knapp, when he said:\r\n\r\n  Where to commence is the first problem of reform. Shall we trust\r\n  the people and commence by increasing their resources, or shall\r\n  our efforts be directed to improving farm dwellings and home\r\n  conditions, the construction of better highways, the introduction\r\n  of the telephone, rural free delivery, a community library, or\r\n  improved social and religious privileges? Evidently it depends\r\n  upon the degree of advancement in rural communities. The remedy\r\n  that would help one might be utterly unapplicable to another.\r\n  For example, if it were found that the average farmer in a rural\r\n  township lived in a house valued at about $100, without barn,\r\n  garden, cow, or pasture, with an insufficient supply of poultry,\r\n  and unable to read and heavily involved in debt, it would be the\r\n  height of unwisdom to commence the rural uplift by establishing\r\n  a public library or even a school. The rural toilers must be\r\n  first properly nourished, clothed, and housed. It is the order of\r\n  greatest necessity. The means to do this can not be given to them\r\n  and if it were, there would be no uplift. They must be shown how to\r\n  earn it by a better tillage of the soil, and how to husband their\r\n  earnings by greater thrift. A low wage, a small amount of work\r\n  accomplished in a day, and an uneconomic use of resources are a\r\n  part of any civilization limited by a low earning capacity.\r\n\r\n  No more frequent mistake is made than to assume that the low wage\r\n  is the result of oppression. As a rule the wage is determined by\r\n  the accomplishment. In India it requires from 14 to 24 servants to\r\n  do the work of a small household, where 2 would do it better in\r\n  some portions of the United States.\r\n\r\n  Upon the farm one man in the United States with a good team and\r\n  modern machinery can do the work that 50 to 100 men do in many\r\n  oriental countries. Consequently, when oriental farm laborers\r\n  are paid 5 to 10 cents per day they are paid up to their earning\r\n  capacity and that capacity is insufficient to sustain a high\r\n  civilization.... In attempting to raise the condition of the\r\n  colored man, we frequently start too high up, and in talking of the\r\n  higher progress talk right over his head. When I talk to a negro\r\n  citizen I never talk about the better civilization, but about a\r\n  better chicken, a better pig, or a whitewashed house.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDEMONSTRATION RESULTS\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the close of the first decade of negro extension under the\r\nSmith-Lever Act, it is well to make permanent record of some of the\r\nachievements of the negroes in extension work, not only as a matter\r\nof recognition and commendation, but also to set up milestones to\r\nmark progress. At the close of the next decade these figures will\r\nhave even greater interest than now. In fact, they will increase in\r\nimportance and value with the passing of time.\r\n\r\nThe statistics which follow are not complete because they pertain\r\nto the activities of negro agents only. Hundreds of white agents\r\nhave done some work with negroes, which is not reported separately.\r\nIt is probably safe to say that the numbers represented in the 1924\r\nreport might be doubled. Since a system of extension work for negroes\r\nby negroes has been evolved, the tendency has been to turn the\r\nresponsibility over to negro agents. The most harmonious relations\r\nprevail between white and negro agents in all the States and white\r\nagents always stand ready to advise and help.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFARM DEMONSTRATION WORK\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the calendar year 1924, 3,659 negro farmers undertook\r\ndemonstrations with cotton and 3,072 carried the work to completion\r\nand submitted reports. These demonstrations represented a total of\r\n23,043 acres. In addition, 2,630 junior club members planted an acre\r\nor more of cotton and 1,734 of them completed the work and submitted\r\nreports. Many of these boys cleared more than $100 each on their\r\nacres and some more than $200. This is not bad for boys who attend\r\nschool regularly. Making the usual allowance of about 140 work hours\r\nin a year in the production and harvesting of an acre of cotton,\r\nthese club members earned an average of about $1 an hour for every\r\nhour they worked.\r\n\r\nCorn has always been a favorite crop for demonstrations by adults\r\nand juniors in the South, because it is used so much for food and\r\nfeed and because it responds so well to special attention in that\r\nsection of the country. The 1924 annual reports show that 4,317 negro\r\nfarmers undertook demonstrations with corn and that 3,292 finished\r\nthem in good shape. The demonstrations covered 25,442 acres. Of\r\n8,018 club members who planted an acre apiece, 4,308 completed the\r\nwork with marked success. If each successful demonstration should\r\ninfluence only five neighbors, the totals would be impressive, and\r\ndemonstrations of outstanding size, success, and continuity are\r\neven more far-reaching. From a demonstration viewpoint alone, it is\r\nestimated that a million negro farmers and home makers are being\r\ninfluenced effectively.\r\n\r\nIt is worth while to trace the influence of demonstration in\r\nincreasing the production of cotton and corn, but it is equally\r\nsignificant to trace the influence of demonstrations on the growing\r\nof other crops. Additional attention during the last few years in the\r\nSouth has been given to work with legumes. In order to continue the\r\nproduction of large crops of cotton and corn there must be some soil\r\nbuilding. (Fig. 11.) This can be done most readily with such crops as\r\ncowpeas, soy beans, vetch, velvet beans, clover, and alfalfa.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 11.—Negro agent advising a farmer regarding the value of\r\n  cowpeas, soy beans, and other legumes for soil improvement. During\r\n  1924, negro farmers conducted 9,860 demonstrations with cowpeas,\r\n  soy beans, and other leguminous and forage crops, of which 8,358\r\n  were completed on a total acreage of 54,366.]\r\n\r\nIt is very encouraging to note that the negro farmers carried on\r\n9,860 demonstrations with leguminous and other forage crops in 1924\r\nand that 8,358 of these enterprises were completed on a total acreage\r\nof 54,366. In connection with these totals should be considered\r\n2,679 club members who were enrolled to grow legumes and 1,799 who\r\ncompleted the work on their acres. When it is considered that most\r\nof this work was done on rented land and that most of these crops\r\nrequire inoculation and special care, these figures have unusual\r\nvalue. Of course all the legumes were not planted for soil-building\r\npurposes. Some of them were cash crops and some were grown for\r\nfeed. The order of popularity of the principal crops among these\r\ndemonstrators is indicated by the number of demonstrations begun\r\nin 1924, as follows: Cowpeas, 2,885; velvet beans, 1,498; peanuts,\r\n1,313; soy beans, 1,269; lespedeza, 476; and alfalfa, 272. Vetch,\r\nwhich was included in a miscellaneous total of 384, is increasing in\r\npopularity faster now than any other winter legume.\r\n\r\nThe success of negro farmers with such crops as sweet potatoes,\r\ntobacco, and potatoes shows a strong tendency on their part\r\ntoward diversification in cash and food crops. During 1924, 1,817\r\ndemonstrators were enrolled to grow sweet potatoes and 1,461 of them\r\ncompleted the demonstrations and reported their results at the close\r\nof the season. The club enrollment for this popular crop was 836, of\r\nwhom 590 completed their enterprises and reported. The enrollment\r\nfor potatoes was 993 adults and 619 juniors and the completions were\r\n878 and 448, respectively. In tobacco demonstrations 229 men were\r\nenrolled and 211 finished and reported. In junior extension 482 boys\r\ngrew tobacco. In field-crop activities the enrollment of negro girls\r\nhas been very small, just as it has been among the whites, which\r\nclearly indicates that the boys do most of the work on the farm and\r\nthe girls in the home.\r\n\r\nAs a further contribution to the effort of the South to feed itself,\r\nthe activities of negro farmers with cereals other than corn are\r\nindicative. In 1924 demonstrations were undertaken with wheat, oats,\r\nrye, barley, and other cereals, and 2,580 men, 983 boys, and 5 girls\r\nwere enrolled, of whom 1,871 men, 682 boys, and 5 girls completed.\r\nIn these demonstrations the yields were much larger than those of\r\nnear-by farmers or county averages; frequently they were twice or\r\nthree times as large. When a person undertakes, as a representative\r\nof his county, State, and Nation, to make an object lesson to his\r\nneighbors, he assumes a large responsibility.\r\n\r\nSome of the most successful demonstrations in truck farming, from\r\na financial standpoint, have been made by negroes. Good stories of\r\ntheir work with melons, berries, cabbage, turnips, carrots, celery,\r\nand other similar crops come in constantly. Some of the enrollment\r\nfigures in horticultural demonstrations deserve attention and\r\nfavorable comment. Negro farmers undertook 1,392 demonstrations in\r\ntrucking and market gardening and completed 971 with marked success.\r\nA total of 8,729 persons were enrolled to make object lessons in\r\nhome gardens and 6,502 of them were carried through to completion.\r\nThe enrollment in fruits was 2,045, of whom 1,403 completed. Some\r\nextraordinary service was rendered by these farmers in spraying\r\nand pruning, which made their results more satisfactory and their\r\nexamples more potent. In fact, many demonstrators became teachers and\r\nleaders through the merits of their work.\r\n\r\nUnusual significance may very properly be attached to the livestock\r\ndemonstrations of negro farmers. The large number of cows, hogs, and\r\nchickens owned by them indicates increased land ownership by negroes.\r\nIt throws light also on the increased production of feed crops. The\r\nannual reports for 1924 show that 9,936 adult farmers and farm women\r\nwere enrolled as livestock demonstrators, of whom 7,379 completed the\r\nyear’s work and submitted reports. It is safe to assume that most\r\nof the 264,432 animals used in these demonstrations were purebred.\r\nLikewise, it means progress when it is realized that negro boys\r\nand girls cared for 102,070 high-class farm animals in their club\r\nenterprises. The enrollment of negro boys and girls in livestock work\r\nis worthy of the detailed statement given in Table 2.\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLE 2.—_Enrollment of negro boys and girls in livestock\r\ndemonstrations, 1924_\r\n\r\n  ——————————————+———————+——————\r\n   Line of work |  Boys | Girls\r\n  ——————————————+———————+——————\r\n  Hogs          | 3,774 |   682\r\n  Dairy cattle  |   505 | 2,732\r\n  Beef cattle   |    83 |     4\r\n  Poultry       | 2,154 | 7,753\r\n  ——————————————+———————+——————\r\n\r\nSome idea of the substantial nature of the accomplishments of negro\r\nagents may be found in the record for 1924, which shows that they\r\nhelped to procure better sires for the flocks and herds of 3,552\r\nfarms and that they had flocks and herds culled on 4,848 farms. They\r\nalso introduced better balanced feeding for farm animals on 9,520\r\nfarms.\r\n\r\nNegro demonstrators used 68,126 tons of fertilizer and 8,288 tons\r\nof lime in their exemplary farm enterprises in 1924, and they\r\nplowed under 13,547 acres of cover and green-manure crops in their\r\nsoil-improvement operations. Terracing was done on 1,738 farms and\r\nsoil erosion was thereby prevented on 43,299 acres. Drainage systems\r\nwere installed on 573 farms and 18,405 acres were thereby made more\r\nproductive and valuable.\r\n\r\nThe climax of negro extension work comes in the constructive\r\nfeatures just as for the whites. Special import should therefore\r\nbe attached to the fact that the agents had 463 barns, 411 hog\r\nhouses, and 787 poultry houses built according to approved plans.\r\nSome rural-engineering work of a constructive nature was done on\r\n3,967 farms under the guidance of negro extension agents. All this\r\ndevelopment means that thousands of the best negroes are learning\r\nlessons of thrift, economy, and enterprise. They are coming to\r\nrealize more and more the importance of owning land and building\r\npermanent homes. Another decade will probably show even greater\r\nresults along these lines.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHOME DEMONSTRATION WORK\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is certainly very gratifying to note that a large number of negro\r\nwomen and girls are doing excellent home demonstration work. When it\r\nis remembered that they have to help a great deal in cotton, tobacco,\r\nand other fields, there is unusual significance in the fact that they\r\nare willing and anxious to take part in the special activities which\r\nmake for better living and better homes. In 1924, 21,509 women and\r\n27,114 girls were enrolled in the various activities which pertain\r\ndefinitely to the improvement of the home.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting, also, to compare the figures on home gardens\r\nwith those on food preservation and preparation. There seems to be\r\na logical sequence here. During the year, 12,355 women and 14,641\r\ngirls were enrolled in home gardening; 13,911 women and 13,826 girls,\r\nin food preservation; and 14,731 women and 16,537 girls, in food\r\npreparation. As a rule, the work begins with garden demonstrations,\r\nso it would seem that the interest increases as the work progresses.\r\nIt should be remembered also that women and girls did most of the\r\nwork with poultry. The proportion of members completing these\r\ndemonstrations and the number of method demonstrations necessary for\r\ninstruction were about the same as the averages of agents in other\r\nparts of the country and in other lines of work.\r\n\r\nGardening work is begun with the most staple and standard crops and\r\nsoon leads to winter and perennial gardens and the growing of small\r\nfruits. Wherever home ownership obtains, the garden demonstrations\r\nare followed by orchard and lawn demonstrations. Fruit trees suitable\r\nto climatic and soil conditions are planted around the homes, and\r\nsuch activities always approach their climax in beautified front\r\nyards and lawns.\r\n\r\nThe number of dwellings constructed and remodeled under the guidance\r\nof negro women agents and the number of club members demonstrating\r\nthe beautification of home grounds indicate clearly the progress of\r\nnegro home demonstration work. Such activities show that other steps\r\nhave been taken before the family is ready to build. They show,\r\nalso, that a great deal of interest has been aroused and that the\r\nearning power of the people must have been increased to make such\r\nimprovements possible. In 1924, 569 houses were built in accordance\r\nwith plans furnished by negro extension agents and 1,002 houses\r\nwere remodeled in accordance with the suggestions made by them. The\r\nfact that so much work was done to make homes attractive indicates\r\nthat demonstrators are anxious to make improvements. This point is\r\nstill further emphasized by the number of members who were enrolled\r\nin demonstrations in the beautification of home grounds. A total\r\nof 6,433 women and 6,427 girls took up this important enterprise;\r\nin 1,336 homes the grounds were laid out according to a definite\r\nlandscape plan; and 335 school and community grounds were planted\r\naccording to plans.\r\n\r\nPaint and whitewash are good indexes of improvement and prosperity.\r\nDemonstrations of this nature exert a fine influence from the\r\nstandpoint of morals and civilization. In 1924, 2,259 dwellings were\r\npainted or whitewashed as the result of extension influence. Many of\r\nthe dwellings which were built or remodeled installed running water\r\nand lighting and heating systems. Altogether, 151 houses installed\r\none or more of these improvements.\r\n\r\nPerhaps no phases of home demonstration work are more valuable among\r\nnegroes than sanitation and health, which were exemplified by more\r\nthan 10,000 negro homes. In 2,361 homes the doors and windows were\r\nscreened and in 3,781 homes other methods of insect control and\r\nextermination were followed. In most Southern States, negro agents\r\nhave definite plans with blue prints for the construction of sanitary\r\nclosets. These plans were followed in 1,890 homes. A total of 9,734\r\nwomen and 10,351 girls were enrolled in home-health and sanitation\r\ndemonstrations. The agents gave more than 5,000 demonstrations by\r\nway of instruction along this line. The club members and the home\r\ndemonstrators took much interest in home nursing, first aid, care of\r\nteeth, care of skin, good posture, prevention of colds, and similar\r\nhealth activities which the agents were emphasizing.\r\n\r\nThe statistics on house furnishings by negro women and girls compare\r\nfavorably with their activities along other lines. (Fig. 12.) During\r\n1924, 7,688 women and 8,656 girls were enrolled to make or buy and\r\ninstall certain house furnishings suggested by the agents. More than\r\n3,000 individuals conducted demonstrations in treating woodwork,\r\nwalls, and floors. As a result of demonstrations carried on in house\r\nfurnishings, 4,938 improvements were made in bedrooms, 1,744 in\r\nliving rooms, 2,190 in dining rooms, and 1,717 in other rooms of the\r\nhouse.\r\n\r\nDuring the year 4,962 demonstrations in home management were\r\nconducted by women and girls, most of them pertaining to the kitchen\r\nand its equipment. Negro women and girls in their demonstration\r\nactivities rearranged 2,226 kitchens according to plans outlined by\r\nnegro extension agents, installed 326 fireless cookers, 312 kitchen\r\nsinks, 1,198 kitchen cabinets, and thousands of other articles of\r\nequipment and convenience in the kitchen. In equipping the home\r\nlaundry 277 hand washing machines and 26 power washing machines were\r\nobtained. The women and girls also bought 623 electric and gasoline\r\nirons and 70 power vacuum cleaners. The record shows that 4,008 club\r\nmembers and demonstrators followed improved laundry practices for the\r\nfirst time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAGENTS’ ACTIVITIES\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the conduct of demonstration work with negroes the agents made\r\nvisits to 28,410 farms and 26,515 homes. It required 86,824 farm\r\nvisits and 49,334 home visits to get the results heretofore reported.\r\nIt therefore seems that each demonstration farm required an average\r\nof three visits and each demonstration home an average of about\r\ntwo visits. If the demonstrations are large and successful enough,\r\nthe agents will be justified in increasing their visits and also\r\nin further magnifying them with field meetings and tours where the\r\ndemonstrations will be greatly emphasized and the good influences\r\nextended.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 12.—Negro home demonstration agent demonstrating the making\r\n  of rugs for the home. During 1924, 7,688 women and 8,656 girls\r\n  were enrolled to make or buy and install certain house furnishings\r\n  suggested by the agents.]\r\n\r\nIt may be noted further that the agents spent 37,418 days in the\r\nfield and 15,435 days in the office. The negro agents reported 46,100\r\nmethod and result demonstration meetings with a total attendance\r\nof 820,366. This was in addition to 1,863 special meetings for\r\ndemonstrators and leaders, 358 short courses, and 107 camps for\r\nspecial training. Altogether, more than a million people attended\r\nthe special and regular meetings for the promotion of extension work\r\namong negroes. To these impressive totals the number of fairs and\r\nexhibits should be added. Negroes made exhibits at 815 different\r\ncommunity, county, and State fairs, which were seen and studied by\r\nthousands of people. Lantern slides and motion pictures were shown at\r\nmore than 500 meetings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOUTLOOK\r\n\r\n\r\nThe extension work for negroes and by negroes has been built up\r\npractically in the last 10 years. It is a wonderful development in\r\nsuch a short time. It took about the same length of time to build a\r\nsimilar organization for white people. When it is remembered that\r\nnegro work has been established in a period of transition, turmoil,\r\nand readjustment, the significance is all the more remarkable. It is\r\na fine tribute to the good work of the negro agents that, when the\r\nperiod of retrenchment came soon after the World War, their force\r\nand their appropriations were the only ones which were not reduced.\r\nWith this solid foundation, with this inspiring record, and with this\r\nsuccessful history the near future holds out much hope for even more\r\nrapid development. There is no field of education in this country now\r\nwhere greater good can be accomplished by earnest, devoted agents\r\nworking along the right lines.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSTATISTICS\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLE
