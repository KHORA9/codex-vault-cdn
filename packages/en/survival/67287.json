It was hailed with\r\nenthusiasm by some as \"opening a new era in geological science\"; but\r\nwas regarded with scepticism by others, in consequence of the condition\r\nand mineral character of the supposed fossil, and because of the great\r\ninterval in time between the oldest animal remains previously known and\r\nthese new claimants for recognition. Since that time, many new facts\r\nhave been learned, and the question has been under almost continuous\r\ndiscussion and debate, with various fortunes, in different quarters.\r\n\r\nThe author was associated with the original discovery and description\r\nof these supposed earliest traces of life; and has since, in the\r\nintervals of other work, devoted much time to further exploration and\r\nresearch, the results of which have been published from time to time in\r\nthe form of scientific papers. He has also given attention to the later\r\ndiscoveries which have tended to fill up the gap between the Laurentian\r\nfossil and its oldest known successors.\r\n\r\nIn 1875 he endeavoured to sum up in a popular form what was then known,\r\nin a little volume named \"The Dawn of Life,\" which has long been out of\r\nprint; and in 1893 the matter was referred to in a chapter of his work\r\n\"Salient Points in the Science of the Earth.\" In 1895 he was invited\r\nto present the subject to a large and intelligent audience in a course\r\nof lectures delivered in the Lowell Institute, Boston; and the success\r\nwhich attended these lectures has induced him to reproduce them in the\r\npresent work, in the hope that inquiries into the Dawn of Life may\r\nprove as fascinating to general readers as to those who prosecute them\r\nas a matter of serious work, and that their presentation in this form\r\nmay stimulate further research in a field which is destined in the\r\ncoming years to add new and important domains to the knowledge of life\r\nin the early history of the earth.\r\n\r\nHypotheses respecting the introduction and development of life are\r\nsufficiently plentiful; but the most scientific method of dealing\r\nwith such questions is that of searching carefully for the earliest\r\nremains of living beings which have been preserved to us in the rocky\r\nstorehouses of the earth.\r\n\r\nThere are many earnest labourers in this difficult field, and it will\r\nbe the object of the writer in the following pages to do justice to\r\ntheir work as far as known to him, as well as to state his own results.\r\n\r\n                                                               J.

To us\r\nthe objects around us and even our seniors in age seem to have always\r\nbeen, and to have had no origin or childhood. It is only as we advance\r\nin knowledge and experience that we learn to recognise distinctions\r\nof age in beings older than ourselves. In thinking of this, it seems\r\nat first sight an anomaly, or at least contrary to analogy, that the\r\noldest literature and philosophy deal so much with doctrines as to the\r\norigins of things. In this respect primitive men do not seem to have\r\nresembled children; and the fact that our own sacred records begin with\r\nanswers to such questions, and that these appear in the oldest literary\r\nremains of so many ancient nations, and even in the folk-lore of\r\nbarbarous tribes, might be used as an additional argument in favour of\r\nan early Divine revelation on such subjects, as a means of awakening\r\nprimitive men to the comprehension of their own place in the universe.\r\n\r\nHowever this may be, it is certain that modern science at first took a\r\ndifferent stand.\r\n\r\nThe constancy of the motions of the heavenly bodies, our great\r\ntime-keepers, and of the changes on the earth depending upon them, and\r\nthe resolution of apparent perturbations into cycles of greater or less\r\nlength, impressed astronomers and physicists with the permanence of the\r\narrangements of the heavens and their eternal circling round without\r\nany change. In like manner, on the rise of geology, the succession of\r\nchanges recorded in the earth seemed interminable, and Hutton could\r\nsay that in the geological chronology he could see \"no vestige of a\r\nbeginning, no prospect of an end.\"\r\n\r\nBut the progress of investigation has changed all this, and has brought\r\nphysical and natural science back to a position nearer to that of\r\nthe old cosmogonies. Physical astronomy has shown that the constant\r\nemission of heat and light from the sun and other stars must have had\r\na beginning, and is hurrying on toward an end, that the earth and\r\nits satellite the moon are receding from each other, and that even\r\nthe spinning of our globe on its axis is diminishing in rapidity.\r\nIn summing up these and other changes, Lord Kelvin says: \"To hold\r\nthe doctrine of the eternity of the universe would be to maintain a\r\nstupendous miracle, and one contrary to the fundamental laws of matter\r\nand force.\"\r\n\r\nSo, on our earth itself, we can now assign to their relative ages\r\nthose great mountain chains which have been emblems of eternity. We\r\ncan transfer ourselves in imagination back to a time when man and his\r\ncompanion animals of to-day did not exist, when our continents and\r\nseas had not assumed their present forms, and even when the earth was\r\nan incandescent mass with all its volatile materials suspended in its\r\natmosphere. It is true that in all the changes which our earth has\r\nundergone the same properties of matter and the same natural laws\r\nhave prevailed; but the interactions of these properties and laws\r\nhave been tending to continuous changes in definite directions, and\r\nnot infrequently to accumulations of tension leading to paroxysmal\r\nvicissitudes.\r\n\r\nIf all this is true of the earth itself, it is especially applicable\r\nto its living inhabitants. Successive dynasties of animals and plants\r\nhave occupied the earth in the course of geological time; and as we go\r\nback in the record of the rocks, first man himself and, in succession,\r\nall the higher animals disappear, until at length in the oldest\r\nfossiliferous beds only a portion of the more humble inhabitants of the\r\nsea can be found. In the time of the formation of the oldest of these\r\nrocks, or perhaps somewhat earlier, must have been the first beginning\r\nof life on our planet.\r\n\r\nJust as we can trace every individual animal to a microscopic germ in\r\nwhich all its parts were potentially present, so we can trace species,\r\ngenera, and larger groups of animals to their commencement at different\r\npoints of the earth's history, and can endeavour to follow the lines\r\nof creation or descent back to the first beings in which vital powers\r\nmanifested themselves. All such beginnings must end in mystery, for\r\nas yet we do not know how either a germ or a perfect animal could\r\noriginate from inanimate matter; but we may hope at least to make some\r\napproximation to the date of the origin of life and to a knowledge of\r\nthe conditions under which it began to exist, confining ourselves for\r\nthe present principally to the Animal Kingdom.\r\n\r\nAs preliminary to the consideration of this subject, we may shortly\r\nnotice the grades of animals at present existing, and then the evidence\r\nwhich we have of their successive appearance in different periods of\r\ngeological time, in order that we may eliminate all those of more\r\nrecent origin, in so far as the knowledge at present available will\r\npermit, and restrict our consideration to forms which seem to have been\r\nthe earliest. In attempting this, we may use for reference the table\r\nof geological periods and animal types presented in the diagram facing\r\nthis chapter, which is based on one prepared by Prof. Charles A. White,\r\nof the United States Geological Survey, with modifications to adapt it\r\nto our present purpose. In this table the leading groups of animals are\r\nrepresented by lines stretching downward in the geological column of\r\nformations as far as they have yet been traced. Such a table, it must\r\nbe observed, is always liable to the possibility of one or more of its\r\nlines being extended farther downward by new discoveries.\r\n\r\nThe broadest general division of the Animal Kingdom is into back-boned\r\nanimals (Vertebrates) and those which have no back-bone or equivalent\r\nstructure (Invertebrates).[1] The former includes, besides man\r\nhimself, the familiar groups of Beasts, Birds, Reptiles, and Fishes.\r\nThe latter consists of the great swarms of creatures included under\r\nthe terms Insects, Crustaceans, Worms, Cuttle-fishes, Snails, Bivalve\r\nMollusks, Star-fishes, Sea-urchins, Coral Animals, Sea-jellies.\r\nSponges, and Animalcules. This mixed multitude of animals, mostly of\r\nlow grade and aquatic. Includes a vast variety of forms, which, though\r\ncomparatively little known to ordinary observers, are vastly numerous,\r\nof great interest to naturalists, and, as we shall find, greatly older\r\nin geological date than the higher animals.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: The twofold primary division now sometimes used, into\r\nMetazoa and Protozoa, seems more arbitrary and unequal, and therefore\r\nof less practical value.]\r\n\r\nIt will be seen by a glance at the diagram that the higher vertebrates\r\nare of most recent origin, man himself coming in as one of the newest\r\nof all. Only the lower reptiles or batrachians and the fishes extend\r\nvery far back in geological time. None of the other vertebrate groups\r\nreach, so far as yet known, farther back than the middle of the\r\ngeological scale--probably in point of time very much less than this.\r\nThose of the invertebrates that breathe air reach no farther back than\r\nthe fishes, possibly not so far. On the other hand, all the leading\r\ngroups of marine invertebrates run without interruption back to the\r\nLower Cambrian, and some of them still farther. Thus it would appear\r\nthat for long ages before the introduction of land or air-breathing\r\nanimals of any kind, the sea swarmed with animal life, which was almost\r\nas varied as that which now inhabits it. The reasons of this would seem\r\nto be that the better support given by the water makes less demands\r\nupon organs for mechanical strength, that the water preserves a more\r\nuniform temperature than the air, and that arrangements for respiration\r\nin water are less elaborate than those necessary in air. Hence the\r\nconditions of life are, so to speak, easier in water than in air, more\r\nespecially for creatures of simple structure and low vital energy.\r\nBesides this, the waters occupy two-thirds of the surface of the earth,\r\nand in earlier periods probably covered a still greater area.\r\n\r\nWe are now in a position to understand that the Animal Kingdom had\r\nnot one but many beginnings, its leading types arriving in succession\r\nthroughout geological time. Thus the special beginning of any one line\r\nof life, or those of different lines, might form special subjects\r\nof inquiry; but our present object is to inquire as to the first or\r\nearliest introduction of life in our planet, and in what form or forms\r\nit appeared. We may, therefore, neglect all the vertebrate animals and\r\nthe air-breathing invertebrates, and may restrict our inquiries to\r\nmarine invertebrates.\r\n\r\nIn relation to these, six of the larger divisions or provinces of the\r\nAnimal Kingdom may suffice to include all the lower inhabitants of the\r\nocean, whether now or in some of the oldest fossiliferous rocks.[2]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Some modern zoologists, having perhaps, like some of the\r\nold Greeks, lost the idea of the unity of nature, or at least that of\r\none presiding divinity, prefer for the larger divisions of animals\r\nthe term _phylum_ or _phylon_, implying merely a stock, race or kind,\r\nwithout reference to a definite place in an ordered kosmos.]\r\n\r\nLooking more in detail at our diagram, we observe that the higher\r\nvertebrates nearest to man in structure extend back but a little\r\nway, or, with a few minor exceptions, only as far as the beginning\r\nof the Kainozoic or Tertiary Period, in the later part of which\r\nwe still exist. Other air-breathing vertebrates, the birds and\r\nthe true reptiles, extend considerably farther, to the beginning\r\nof the previous or Mesozoic Period. The amphibians, or frog-like\r\nreptiles, reach somewhat farther, and the fishes and the air-breathing\r\narthropods farther still. On the other hand, our six great groups of\r\nmarine invertebrates run back for a vast length of time, without any\r\ncompanions, to the lowest Palæozoic, and this applies to their higher\r\ntypes, the cuttles and their allies, and the crustaceans, as well as\r\nto the lower tribes. Turning now again to our table, we find that\r\nthese creatures extend in unbroken lines back to the Lower Cambrian,\r\nthe oldest beds in which we find any considerable number of organic\r\nremains, and leave all the other members of the Animal Kingdom far\r\nbehind.\r\n\r\nIf now we endeavour to arrange the leading groups of these persistent\r\ninvertebrates under a few general names, we may use the following,\r\nbeginning with those highest in rank:--\r\n\r\n(1) _Insects_ and _Crustaceans_ (Arthropoda).\r\n\r\n(2) _Cuttles, univalve and bivalve Shell-fishes_ (Mollusca).\r\n\r\n(3) _Worms_ (Annelida).\r\n\r\n(4) _Sea-urchins_ and _Sea-stars_ (Echinodermata).\r\n\r\n(5) _Coral Animals_, _Sea-anemones_, and _Sea-jellies_ (Cœlenterata).\r\n\r\n(6) _Sponges_, _Foraminifera_ and _Animalcules_ of simple organization\r\n(Protozoa).\r\n\r\nThere are, it is true, some animals allied to the mollusks and worms,\r\nwhich might be entitled to form separate groups, though of minor\r\nimportance The position of the sponges is doubtful, and the great mass\r\nof Protozoa may admit of subdivision; but for our present purpose these\r\nsix great groups or provinces of the Animal Kingdom may be held to\r\ninclude all the humbler forms of aquatic life, and they keep company\r\nwith each other as far as the Early Cambrian. If, in accordance with\r\nthe previous statements, we choose to divide the earth's history by\r\nthe development of animal life rather than by rock formations, and to\r\nregard each period as presided over by dominant animal forms, we shall\r\nthus have an age of man, an age of mammals, an age of reptiles and\r\nbirds, an age of amphibians and fishes, and an age of crustaceans and\r\nmollusks.\r\n\r\nIt is only within recent years that the researches more especially of\r\nBarrande, Hicks, Lapworth, Linarrson, Brögger, and others in Europe,\r\nand of Matthew, Ford and Walcott in America, have enlarged the known\r\nanimals of the Lower Cambrian to nearly 200 species, and below this\r\nwe know as yet very little of animal life. We may therefore take the\r\nLower Cambrian, or \"Olenellus Zone\" as it has been called from one of\r\nits more important crustaceans,[3] as our starting-point for plunging\r\ninto the depths below. In doing so, we may remark on the orderly and\r\nsymmetrical nature of the chain of life, and on the strange fact that\r\nfor so long ages animal life seems to have been confined to the waters,\r\nand to have undergone little development toward its higher forms. It\r\nis like a tree with a tall branchless stem bearing all its leaves and\r\nverdure at the top, or like some obscure tribe of men long living in\r\nisolation and unknown to fame, and then, under some hidden impulse\r\nor opportunity, becoming a great conquering and dominant nation. Or\r\nto compare it with higher things, it is like the Christian religion,\r\nfor ages confined to a small and comparatively unimportant people,\r\nand developing slowly its faith and hopes, and then suddenly, under\r\nthe personal influence of Christ and His apostles, spreading itself\r\nover the world, and in a few centuries becoming the ruling power in\r\nits greatest empire, surviving the fall of this and permeating all\r\nthe great nations that sprang from its ruins. God's plans in nature,\r\nin history, and in grace seem to us very slow in their growth and\r\nmaturity, but they are very sure.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: See figure, p. 20.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                     _LIFE IN THE EARLY CAMBRIAN_\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  II\r\n\r\n                     _LIFE IN THE EARLY CAMBRIAN_\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the old Chaldean fable of the descent of Ishtar into Hades, to\r\nrecover her lost Tammuz, at each successive gate of the lower regions\r\nshe is stripped of some of her ornaments and garments, till at length\r\nshe has to appear naked and unadorned in the presence of the lord of\r\nthe Nether World. So in our descent from the surface on which men\r\nlive, through the successive rocky layers of the earth's crust, we\r\nleave behind, one by one, all the higher forms of life with which we\r\nare familiar; but there still remain to us our six groups of aquatic\r\ninvertebrates, in the guise, it is true, of species and genera now\r\nunknown in a living state, yet well represented as far down as the\r\nlower part of the Cambrian. Let us now suppose that we take our stand\r\non the shores of the Cambrian sea, or cast our dredge into its waters\r\nin search of these old animals; though we can only actually do so by\r\npainfully hammering and chiselling them out of their rocky tombs, and\r\nthis often in fragments which must be put together before we can fully\r\nrealize the forms and structures of the animals to which they belonged.\r\n\r\nWe may pause here, however, to remark that neither the geographical\r\nnor climatal conditions of the earth at this early time were similar\r\nto these with which we are now familiar. The marine animals of the\r\nCambrian have left their remains in beds of sediment, which now\r\nconstitute rocks forming parts of our continents remote from the sea,\r\nand much elevated above its level, showing that large areas, then under\r\nthe ocean, are now dry land; while there is no good evidence that\r\nthe sea and land have changed places. The facts rather indicate that\r\nthe continents have extended their area at the expense of the ocean,\r\nwhich has, however, probably increased in depth. In evidence of these\r\nstatements, I need only mention that some of the oldest rocks in the\r\nScottish and Welsh hills, in Scandinavia, in Russia and in Bohemia, are\r\nrich in Cambrian marine fossils.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 1.--_Olenellus Thompsoni_, Hall.\r\n\r\nA characteristic Trilobite of the Lower Cambrian in North America.\r\nAfter Walcott and specimen in Peter Redpath Museum.]\r\n\r\nIn America, in like manner, such rocks are found on the flanks of the\r\nAppalachians, in New Brunswick, and in Newfoundland, in the table-land\r\nof Colorado and in the Rocky Mountains. In point of fact, a map of\r\nthe Northern Hemisphere at this period would show only a limited\r\ncircumpolar continent with some outlying islands to the south of it,\r\nand shallows stretching across the northern part of the areas of the\r\npresent Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. The great ocean, however, thus\r\nextending over most of the temperate and tropical parts of the Northern\r\nHemisphere, was probably also more muddy and shallow than that of\r\nmodern times. The surface temperature of this vast ocean was also,\r\nit is probable, more uniform than that of the modern sea, while even\r\nits profounder depths or abysses would have more earth-heat than at\r\npresent. Thus we may, without hesitation, affirm that in this early\r\nage the conditions for the introduction of swarming marine life of low\r\ngrade, and its extension over the whole earth, were at a maximum.\r\n\r\nLet us inquire, then, what these old Cambrian seas actually produced,\r\nmore especially in the early portions of that ancient and probably\r\nprotracted time.\r\n\r\nThe most highly organized type of which we have any certain evidence\r\nis that of the Crustacea, the group to which our modern lobsters and\r\ncrabs belong, and its most prominent representatives are the trilobites\r\n(Figs. 1, 2), so called from the three lobes into which the body is\r\ndivided. These creatures are indeed remarkable for the twofold property\r\nof bilateral symmetry, and fore and aft jointed structure, both based\r\non the number three. From front to rear we have a large head, usually\r\nwith well-developed eyes and oral organs, a middle or thoracic part\r\ncomposed of a series of movable segments, and a tail-piece sometimes\r\nsmall, sometimes nearly as large as the head. Transversely, the body\r\nis divided into a central and two lateral lobes, which can be seen in\r\nthe head, the thorax, and usually in the tail as well. The organization\r\nof these animals must have been as complex as that of most existing\r\nCrustaceans. Their nerve system must have been well developed; a vast\r\nnumber of muscles were required to move the different parts of the\r\ntrunk, and the numerous and complex limbs which have been observed\r\nin some of the species, and no doubt were possessed by all. Their\r\ndigestive and circulatory organs must have been in proportion to the\r\ncomplexity of their locomotive organs.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 2.--_Triarthrus Becki_, Green.\r\n\r\nA Trilobite of primitive type, showing its limbs and antennæ. (After\r\nBeecher.)]\r\n\r\nFigure 2, borrowed from Beecher,[4] shows the limbs of a species,\r\nnot of the Lower Cambrian, but of a somewhat later formation. There\r\ncan be no doubt, however, that those of earlier species were equally\r\nperfect, more especially as Triarthrus is an animal of an old type\r\napproaching to extinction in the age succeeding the Cambrian, and its\r\nrepresentatives in the earlier and palmy days of the family could not\r\nhave been inferior in organization. These creatures swarmed in every\r\nsea in the Cambrian period, and were represented by a great number of\r\nspecies, some of them of large size, others very small; some \r\nmany-jointed, others few-jointed, and with a great variety of tubercles,\r\nspines, and other ornamental and protective parts. If we ask for their\r\naffinities and place in the great group of Crustacea, the answer must\r\nbe that, while in some points allied to the higher forms, they approach\r\nmost nearly to those which occupy a medium position in the class, and\r\nare, in fact, a composite type, presenting points of structure now\r\ndistributed among different groups. If we ask for affinities with lower\r\ngroups, we have to reply that their nearest allies in this direction\r\nare the bristle-footed marine worms; but there is a vast gap, both\r\nin the Cambrian and Modern seas, between any of these worms and the\r\nCrustacea, which, either as embryos or as adults, have any resemblance\r\nto them.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: _American Journal of Science_, 1896.]\r\n\r\nThe Trilobites, after appearing in a great variety of generic and\r\nspecific forms, and playing a most important part in their time,\r\nwere not destined to continue beyond the Carboniferous period, and\r\nbefore that time they were beginning to give place to the Limuli,\r\nKing-crabs, or Horseshoe-crabs, a few species of which continue on our\r\ncoasts until the present time. In this limited duration the Trilobites\r\npresent a strange contrast to certain shrimp-like Crustaceans, their\r\ncontemporaries (the Phyllopods), which very closely resemble some\r\nstill extant, and the same remark applies to swarms of little bivalve\r\nCrustaceans (Ostracods), which are still represented by hosts of modern\r\nspecies both in the sea and in the fresh waters. There is, however,\r\na remarkable group of shrimp-like Crustaceans, represented in the\r\nmodern world by only a few small species, which in the Cambrian age\r\nattained greater size, and constitute a very generalized type combining\r\ncharacters now found in lower and higher groups of Crustacea.\r\n\r\n_Hymenocaris vermicauda_ of Salter (Fig. 3) may serve to illustrate one\r\nof these primitive forms.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 3.--_Hymenocaris vermicauda_, Salter.\r\n\r\nA Lower Cambrian Shrimp of generalized type. (After Salter.)]\r\n\r\nIn point of fact, as Dr. Henry Woodward has shown in an able\r\npresidential address delivered to the Geological Society in 1895, at\r\nthe base of the Lower Cambrian we still have several distinct groups\r\nof Crustacea; and if with some we were to hold them as traceable to\r\none original form or to a worm-like ancestor, we must seek for this\r\nfar back in those pre-Cambrian rocks in which we find no Crustaceans\r\nwhatever. There is, it is true, no good reason to demand this; for\r\nwhatever the cause, secondary or final, which produced any form of\r\nCrustacean in the Lower Cambrian, it might just as well have produced\r\nseveral distinct forms. Evolutionists seem to be somewhat unreasonable\r\nin demands of this kind, for any cause capable of originating a new\r\nform of living being, might have been operative at the same time in\r\ndifferent localities and under somewhat diverse conditions, and may\r\nalso have acted at different times. All imaginary lines of descent of\r\nanimals are more or less subject to this contingency; and this may\r\npartly account for the great diversity in the lines of affiliation\r\npresented to us by evolutionists, which may in part have a basis in\r\nfact in so far as distinct varietal and racial forms are concerned, but\r\nmay just as likely be entirely fallacious in the case of true species.\r\nIn any case, in the lowest rocks into which we can trace Crustacea, we\r\nhave already probably five of the orders into which their successors\r\nin the modern seas are divided by zoologists; and this is certainly a\r\nsingular and suggestive fact, the significance of which we shall be\r\nbetter prepared to understand at a later stage of our investigation.\r\n\r\nAllied in some respects to the Crustacea, though much lower in grade,\r\nare the marine Worms--a great and varied host--usually inhabiting the\r\nshallower parts of the ocean; though the 330 species collected by the\r\n_Challenger_ expedition show that they also abound in those greater\r\ndepths to which voyagers have only recently had access. Sea-worms seem\r\nthus to be able to live in all depths, as well as in all climates; and\r\nin accordance with this they abound in the oldest rocks, which are\r\noften riddled with the holes caused by their burrowing, or abundantly\r\nmarked on the surfaces of the beds with their trails.\r\n\r\nThe great province of the Mollusca, in which, for our present purpose,\r\nwe may include some aberrant and rudimentary Molluscoids, is now best\r\nknown to us by its medium types, the univalve and bivalve Shell-fishes;\r\nthe higher group of the Cuttle-fishes and Nautili, though not uncommon,\r\nbeing much less numerous, and one at least of the lower groups, the\r\nLamp-shells or Brachiopods, being represented in the modern world\r\nby but few forms. The extension of the Mollusks backwards into the\r\nCambrian is remarkable as being on the whole meagre in comparison with\r\nthat of the Crustaceans, and as presenting only in small numbers the\r\ntypes most common in later times. One or two shells, and perhaps some\r\ntracks, represent the highest group: some forms resembling the floating\r\nspecies of Sea-snails, and a very few ordinary bivalves represent\r\nthe types best known in the modern seas; while the Brachiopods, and\r\nprobably some still simpler forms, are in great comparative excess.\r\nThe individual specimens are also of small size, as if these creatures\r\nwere but insinuating themselves on the arena of life in insignificant\r\nand humble forms. So far as yet known, the lowest groups supposed\r\nto be allied to the Mollusks, the Ascidians or Sea-squirts, and the\r\nSea-mosses (Polyzoa), do not appear; but they may have been represented\r\nby species which possessed no hard parts capable of preservation.\r\n\r\nThis leads us to the consideration that while all the Crustacea\r\nnecessarily possess some kind of crust or external skeleton, the\r\nMollusks are very different in this respect. While some of them have\r\nponderous shells, others even of the highest forms are quite destitute\r\nof such protective parts. This again leads to a curious question\r\nrespecting the armature of the Trilobites. Some of these, even of the\r\nlarger species, have strong and formidable spines, like those of the\r\nKing-crabs and other modern Crustaceans. Now in the modern species we\r\nknow these organs to be intended to defend their possessors against the\r\nattacks of fishes more swift and powerful than themselves. But what\r\nenemies of this kind had the Trilobites to dread? Yet species a foot or\r\nmore in length presented great bayonet-like spines.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 4.--_Ctenichnites ingens_, Matthew.\r\n\r\nA slab with markings of aquatic animals. From specimen in Peter Redpath\r\nMuseum.]\r\n\r\nAll that we know on this subject is that on the surfaces of the Lower\r\nCambrian rocks there are in some places complicated and mysterious\r\ntracks or scratches, which seem to have been produced when the rock\r\nwas in the state of soft mud, by large and swiftly swimming animals\r\npossessing some sort of arms or similar appendages (Fig. 4). Matthew\r\nhas ingeniously suggested that they may have been large Mollusks allied\r\nto the modern gigantic Squids which still abound in the ocean, that\r\nthey may have been sufficiently powerful to prey on the Trilobites,\r\nand, being swift swimmers, would have found them a helpless prey but\r\nfor their defensive spines. Yet such large Mollusks might have perished\r\nwithout leaving any remains recognisable in the rocks, except what\r\nmay be termed their hand-writing on clay. A few small examples of the\r\nshell-bearing species of these highest Mollusks, however, appear in\r\nthe Cambrian, and in the succeeding ages they become very abundant and\r\nattain to large dimensions, again dwindling toward modern times. It\r\nwould thus seem that for some unknown reason the highest and lowest\r\nMollusks may have been locally plentiful, but the intermediate types\r\nwere rare.\r\n\r\nThe much lower group of Echinoderms, or Sea-urchins and Sea-stars,\r\ncuriously enough puts in but a small appearance in the Early Cambrian,\r\nbeing represented, as far as yet known, by only one embryonic group,\r\nthe Cystideans. A little later, however, Feather-stars became greatly\r\nabundant, and a little later still the true Star-fishes and Urchins.\r\nThe aberrant group of the Sea-slugs seems, so far as known, to be of\r\nmore modern origin; but most of these animals are soft-bodied, and\r\nlittle likely to have been preserved.\r\n\r\nThe great group of the coral animals, so marked a feature of later\r\nages, is scarcely known in the oldest Cambrian, except by some\r\nhighly generalized forms[5] (Fig. 5). There are, however, small\r\nZoophytes referable to the lower type of Hydroids, and markings which\r\nare supposed to be casts of stranded Jelly-fishes. If, with some\r\nnaturalists, we regard the Sponges as very humble members of the\r\ncoral group (Cœlenterata), then we have a right to add them to its\r\nrepresentatives in the lowest Cambrian; but perhaps they had better be\r\nranked with the next and lowest group of all--the Protozoa.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: Dr. G. J. Hinde has carefully studied these forms, and\r\nalso similar species occurring in Lower Cambrian beds in different\r\nparts of North America, Spain, Sardinia, and elsewhere. See note in the\r\nAppendix, and _Journal Geol. Society of London_, vol. xlv. p. 125.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 5.--_Archæocyathus profundus_, Billings.\r\n\r\nPossibly a Coral of generalized type from the Lower Cambrian of L'Anse\r\nà Loup, Labrador.

There are also in\r\nthe Cambrian some large, laminated, calcareous bodies (Cryptozoon of\r\nHall), to be noticed more fully below, and which have recently been\r\ntraced in still lower deposits even below the lowest Cambrian (Figs.\r\n7, 8). These have some resemblance to the layer-corals or stromatoporæ\r\nof the Silurian and Ordovician, which are by many regarded as the\r\nskeletons of coral animals of a low type; but the microscopic structure\r\nof Cryptozoon rather allies it with some of the larger forms of\r\nProtozoa found higher up in the series of formations. We shall have to\r\ndiscuss this later in connection with still older fossils.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 7.--_Cryptozoon proliferum_, Hall.\r\n\r\nPortion of slab reduced in size. (After Hall.) See also Fig. 59, p.\r\n237.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 7_a_.--_Portion of thin section of Cryptozoon\r\nproliferum (magnified × 50)._]\r\n\r\n(_a_) Corneous layers, (_a¹_) One of these dividing, (_b_) Intermediate\r\nstroma with granules of calcite, dolomite and quartz, traversed by\r\ncanals.\r\n\r\n_From a Micro-photograph by_ Prof. Penhallow.\r\n\r\n[_To face p. 39._\r\n\r\nIf now in imagination we cast our tow-net or dredge into the sea of the\r\nLower Cambrian, we may hope to take specimens illustrative of all our\r\nsix groups of invertebrate animals, and under several of them examples\r\nof more than one subordinate group. Of the Crustaceans we might have\r\nrepresentatives of four or five ordinal groups, and of the Mollusca\r\nas many. These are the two highest and most complicated. In the four\r\nlower groups we would naturally have less variety, though it would seem\r\nstrange, were it not for so many examples in later periods, that the\r\ndominant and highest groups should be most developed in regard to the\r\nnumber of their modifications.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 8.--_Diagrammatic section of two Laminæ of\r\nCryptozoon, showing the Canals of the intermediate space, or Stroma\r\n(magnified)._\r\n\r\nSpecimen in Peter Redpath Museum.]\r\n\r\nOf the whole we might perhaps have been able to secure at least 200\r\nspecies even in one locality. The likelihood is that if there had been\r\na collecting expedition like that of the _Challenger_ in Early Cambrian\r\ntimes, it could have secured thousands of specific forms representing\r\nall the above types, more especially as we probably know very little of\r\nthe softer and shell-less animals of these old seas, and there is some\r\nreason to believe that these may have been in greater proportion than\r\nin the present ocean.\r\n\r\nIn illustration of the richness of some parts of the lowest Cambrian\r\nsea, I may refer here to the large and beautifully illustrated Memoir\r\nof Walcott on the Lower Cambrian, containing fifty folio plates of\r\nspecies collected in a few districts of North America; and, as a minor\r\nexample, to the contents of a loose boulder of limestone of that age,\r\nfound at Little Metis on the Lower St. Lawrence, under the following\r\ncircumstances (Fig. 9):--\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 9.--_Lower Cambrian Fossils found in a few cubic\r\ninches of limestone in a conglomerate at Little Metis; viz., Trilobites\r\nof genera Olenellus, Ptychoparia, Solenopleura, Protypus; Brachiopod\r\nof genus Iphidea; Pteropod of genus Hyolithes; Gastropod, genus\r\nStenotheca; Sponge, undetermined._]\r\n\r\nAlong what is now the valley of the Lower St. Lawrence and the gulf\r\nof the same name, there seem to have been deposited in the oldest\r\nCambrian or Olenellus period beds of limestone rich in shells of marine\r\nanimals and fragments of these. These can be seen in place in some\r\nparts of Newfoundland, and here and there on the hills bounding the\r\nSt Lawrence River; but for the most part they have been swept away\r\nby the sea when these districts were being elevated to form parts\r\nof the American land. Their ruins appear as boulders and pebbles in\r\nthick beds of conglomerate or pudding-stone, constituting portions of\r\nthe Upper Cambrian and Lower Ordovician series, which now occupy the\r\nsouth coast of the Lower St. Lawrence. In one of these boulders, less\r\nthan a foot in diameter, removed from its hard matrix and carefully\r\nbroken up, I found fragments representing eleven different species,\r\nof which no less than eight were trilobites, one a gastropod, one a\r\nbrachiopod, and one probably a sponge--and this forms an interesting\r\nillustration of the number of species sometimes to be found in a\r\nlimited space, and also of the great prevalence of the Trilobites in\r\nthese beds. The statistics of these groups for North America, as given\r\nby Walcott, show 165 species belonging to all the groups enumerated\r\nabove, and of these the Trilobita constitute one-third of the whole;\r\nso that the Olenellus Zone, as it has been called from one genus of\r\nthese Crustaceans, might well be named the reign of Trilobites, unless,\r\nindeed, as the indications already referred to seem to show, giant\r\ncuttle-fishes, destitute of shells, were then the tyrants of the sea,\r\nbut are represented only by the markings of their long and muscular\r\narms on the soft sea mud while dashing after their Crustacean prey.\r\nWhat I desire, however, chiefly to emphasize is, that in the lowest\r\nbeds of the Cambrian we have evidence of sea-bottoms swarming with\r\nrepresentatives of all the leading types of marine invertebrate life,\r\nand therefore seem to be still far from the beginning of living things,\r\nif that was a slow and gradual process, rather than a sudden or rapid\r\nseries of events.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                          _PRE-CAMBRIAN LIFE_\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  III\r\n\r\n                          _PRE-CAMBRIAN LIFE_\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving traced the chain of life through the long geological ages, from\r\nthe present day back to the Cambrian Period, we may now take our stand\r\non the fauna of the lowest Cambrian or Olenellus Zone, as a platform\r\nwhence we may dive into still deeper abysses of past time. Here,\r\nhowever, we seem to have arrived at a limit beyond which few remains\r\nof living things have yet been discovered, though there still remain\r\npre-Cambrian deposits of vast thickness and occupying large areas of\r\nour continents. These pre-Cambrian formations are as yet among those\r\nleast known to geologists. The absence of fossils, the disturbances and\r\nalterations which the rocks themselves have undergone, and which make\r\ntheir relative ages and arrangement difficult to unravel, have acted\r\nas deterrents to amateur geologists, and have to some extent baffled\r\nthe efforts of official explorers. In addition to this, workers in\r\ndifferent regions have adopted different methods of arrangement and\r\nnomenclature; and in a very recent address, the Director-General of the\r\nGeological Survey of Great Britain expresses his inability to satisfy\r\nhimself of the equivalency of the different pre-Cambrian groups on the\r\nopposite sides of the Atlantic, and in consequence prefers to retain\r\nfor those of Britain merely local names.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, those who hold the modern theories of gradual\r\nevolution repudiate the idea that the Lower Cambrian fauna can be\r\nprimitive, and demand a vast series of changes in previous time to\r\nprepare the way for it. In any case this comparatively unexplored\r\nportion of geological time holds out the inducement of mystery and the\r\npossibility of great discoveries to the hardy adventurers who may enter\r\ninto it. It must now be our effort to explore this dim and mysterious\r\ndawn of life, and to ascertain what forms, if any, are visible amid its\r\nfogs and mists.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Kewenian or Etcheminian.\r\n\r\nIn certain basal Cambrian or infra-Cambrian beds, found by Matthew in\r\nSouthern New Brunswick, by Walcott in Colorado, and by Scandinavian\r\nand English geologists in their respective countries, we find a\r\nfew remains referred to Algæ, or seaweeds; small tests or shells of\r\nProtozoa; burrows and trails similar to those of modern sea-worms;\r\na few bivalve shells allied to modern Lingulæ, but presenting some\r\nremarkable generalized characters; some bivalve and shrimp-like\r\nCrustaceans, spicules of sponges, and large laminated forms\r\n(Cryptozoon) similar to those already referred to as occurring in the\r\nUpper Cambrian; also certain mysterious markings that are supposed to\r\nhave been produced by the arms or tentacles of free-swimming animals\r\nof various kinds. In these lower beds the Trilobites have nearly or\r\nquite disappeared, being represented only by doubtful fragments. The\r\nbeds of rock, originally sandy or muddy sediments, contain fossils very\r\nsparingly, and only in certain layers separated by great thicknesses\r\nof barren material, as if earthy matters were being deposited very\r\nrapidly, or as if animal life was rare on the sea-bottom except at\r\nintervals. It has, however, been suggested as possible[6] that much\r\nof the marine population in those early times consisted of pelagic or\r\nswimming animals destitute of any hard parts that could be preserved.\r\nIn addition to biological arguments in favour of this view, there is\r\nthe fact that some of the beds are stained with carbonaceous or coaly\r\nmatter, as if the sediment had been mixed with decomposed remains of\r\nplants or animals retaining no determinate forms. Future discoveries\r\nmay increase our knowledge of the life of this period preceding the\r\nCambrian, but it is evident that so far as these rocks have been\r\nexamined, they indicate a great step downward in regard to the variety\r\nand complexity of marine life.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 6: By Prof. Brookes, of Johns Hopkins University.]\r\n\r\nStill we must bear in mind that in later periods there have been times\r\nof rapid deposition, in which, in certain localities at least, great\r\nthicknesses of rock with few organic remains were formed. We have\r\ninstances of this in the later Cambrian, in the Ordovician, and still\r\nlater in the Permian and Trias. Thus in the beds immediately underlying\r\nthe lowest Cambrian we may be passing through a tract of comparative\r\nbarrenness to find more fertile ground below.\r\n\r\nIt is also to be observed that there is evidence of disturbance\r\noccurring in the interval between the lowest Cambrian and the highest\r\npre-Cambrian, which may involve the lapse of much time not recorded in\r\nthe localities hitherto explored, but of which monuments may be found\r\nelsewhere.\r\n\r\nWe may now, taking some North American localities as our best available\r\nguides, inquire as to the nature and contents of the beds next below\r\nthe Lower Cambrian.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 10.--_Section at Hanford Brook._ (After Matthew.)\r\n\r\nShowing St. John group resting on Etcheminian, and this on Coldbrook\r\n(Huronian).]\r\n\r\nIn Southern New Brunswick, Matthew indicated, several years ago, the\r\noccurrence of certain conglomerates and sandy and slaty beds over the\r\nrocks, mostly of igneous origin, constituting a great thickness of\r\nbeds under the Cambrian, and known locally as the \"Coldbrook\" series,\r\nwhich is probably equivalent to the Huronian of Northern and Western\r\nCanada, to be noticed later. These beds were at first regarded as an\r\nupper member of the Huronian, but subsequently it was thought better\r\nto unite them with the overlying Cambrian as basal Cambrian. The fact\r\nthat these problematical beds were ascertained to be unconformable to\r\nthe Cambrian, and the peculiarity of their fossils, led to their being\r\nconstituted a separate group under the name _Etcheminian_, which seems\r\nto represent a time and conditions introductory to the Cambrian (Fig.\r\n10). The fossils in these beds are few and hard to find. Matthew has\r\nkindly furnished me with the following list.[7] The Trilobites are\r\nconspicuous by their absence. Sea-worms have left burrows, trails, and\r\ncasts, which probably represent several species (Fig. 11). A single\r\nlittle shell (Volborthella) is supposed to be a precursor of the\r\nstraight chambered shells allied to the modern nautilus, which become\r\nso large and numerous in succeeding periods. There are a few univalve\r\nshell-fishes allied to modern sea-snails, a brachiopod of the antique\r\ngenus Obolus, some fragments supposed to represent Cystideans, a\r\nrudimentary type of the stalked sea-stars so abundant later, spicules\r\nof sponges and minute Protozoa, with shells not unlike those of their\r\nmodern successors. This meagre list sums up the forms of life known\r\nin the Etcheminian of this district, one in which the Cambrian beds\r\nexhibit the rich and varied fauna of Trilobites and other animals\r\ndescribed and figured by Matthew in several successive volumes of the\r\n\"Transactions of the Royal Society of Canada\" (Fig. 12).\r\n\r\n[Footnote 7: \"Transactions Royal Society of Canada,\" vol. vii.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 11.--_Trails of Worms of two types (Psammchnites\r\nand Planilites)._]\r\n\r\nBeds in Newfoundland (the Signal Hill and Random Sound series),\r\nunderlying the Lower Cambrian, have afforded to Murray and Billings\r\nsome well-characterized worm-castings of spiral form, and a few\r\nproblematical forms known as Aspidella, which may be Crustaceans or\r\nMollusks allied to the limpets (Fig. 13).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 12.--_Group of pre-Cambrian (Etcheminian) Animals\r\nfrom the Etcheminian._ (After Matthew.)]\r\n\r\nThe name \"Etcheminian\" is derived from that of an ancient Indian tribe\r\nof New Brunswick.\r\n\r\n(_a_) Volborthella, supposed to be a Cephalopod shell.

Matthew, whose opinion on such a subject is\r\nof the highest authority, regards them as a distinct system, but as\r\nbelonging, with the Cambrian, to the great Palæozoic Period. Van\r\nHise, and some other United States authorities, would separate them\r\neven from the Palæozoic, and unite them with the underlying Huronian,\r\nas representing a \"Proterozoic\" or \"Algonkian\" Period. This is merely\r\na matter of classification, necessarily more or less arbitrary; but I\r\nbelieve the facts to be stated subsequently show that it will be best\r\nto unite the Etcheminian and its equivalents with the Palæozoic, and to\r\nplace the groups lower than this in one great division, equivalent to\r\nPalæozoic, and for which many years ago I proposed the name \"Eozoic,\"\r\nor that of the Dawn of Life.\r\n\r\nHaving thus hastily glanced at the slender fauna of the rocks\r\nimmediately below the Cambrian, we may now proceed to inquire a little\r\nmore in detail into its true value and import as leading toward the\r\nbeginning of life. I have already referred to the apparently sudden\r\ndrop in the number of groups and of species below the base of the\r\nCambrian, and have hinted that this may be an effect of temporary\r\nlocal conditions of deposit or of defective information. Another fact\r\nthat strikes us is the diverse and miscellaneous character of the\r\nfossils that remain to us; and this would suggest that we are either\r\ndealing with a mere handful picked at random, as it were out of a\r\nricher fauna, or that in the beginning of things the gaps and missing\r\nlinks between different forms of life were even more pronounced than\r\nat present. This, however, would be likely to occur if the plan of\r\ncreation was to represent at first different types, with few forms in\r\neach; to produce, in short, a sort of type collection representing the\r\nwhole range of organization by a few characteristic things rather than\r\nto give a complete series, with all the intermediate connections. Such\r\na mode of introduction of life is not _à priori_ improbable, however at\r\nvariance with some prevalent hypotheses.\r\n\r\nBeginning with the higher Invertebrates, we must not conclude that\r\nwe have altogether lost the Trilobites. The fragments referred to\r\nthis group may represent at least a few species, and it would be very\r\ninteresting to know more of these as to their relations to their\r\nsuccessors, and whether they are tending to lower or more embryonic\r\nforms. The bivalve Crustaceans (Ostracods) may be regarded as inferior\r\nin rank to the Trilobites, but are still very complex, and specialized\r\nanimals and a specimen silicified in such a manner as to show the\r\ninterior organs testified that, as far back as the Carboniferous at\r\nleast, these creatures were as highly organized as at present,[11]\r\nwhile their generally larger size in the earlier formations tends to\r\nshow that they have rather been degenerating in the lapse of geological\r\ntime.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 11: _Palæocypris Edwardsi_, Brougniart, Coal Formation of St.\r\nEtienne, France.]\r\n\r\nIn regard to the Sea-worms, the burrows, castings, and trails found\r\nin the pre-Cambrian beds are scarcely, if at all, different from\r\nthose now seen on sandy and muddy shores, and would seem to indicate\r\nthat these highly organized and very sensitive and active creatures\r\nswarmed in the muddy bottom of the pre-Cambrian Sea, and lived in the\r\nsame way as at present. It is impossible, however, to know anything\r\nof the internal structures of these creatures, but the marks left by\r\ntheir bristle-bearing feet seem to indicate that some of them at least\r\nbelong to the higher group of Sea-centipedes, creatures rivalling the\r\nCrustaceans in complexity of organization, and near to them in plan\r\nof structure, though at present usually widely separated from them in\r\ncurrent systems of classification. In the Ordovician system, next above\r\nthe Cambrian, Hinde has found many curiously formed jaws of animals of\r\nthis kind, which show at least that their alimentary arrangements were\r\nsimilar to those now in force. If any of the problematical \"Conodonts\"\r\ndiscovered by Pander in the Cambrian of Russia belonged to marine\r\nworms, this inference would be extended back to the Lower Cambrian,\r\nso that if the evidence of structure anywhere remains we may hope\r\nto find that the pre-Cambrian worms were not inferior to their more\r\nmodern successors, perhaps even that in this early period, when they\r\nprobably played a more important part in nature, they were of higher\r\norganization than in later times.\r\n\r\nThe evidence as to pre-Cambrian mollusks, so far as it goes, is\r\neven more curious. The little shell called Volborthella, so far as\r\ncan be judged from its form and internal structure, is a miniature\r\nrepresentative of these straight Nautili, the Orthoceratites of\r\nthe Ordovician and later Palæozoic rocks; and no one doubts that\r\nthese latter belong to the highest class of the Mollusks, a class\r\napproaching in the development of nerve system and sensory organs to\r\nthe Vertebrates themselves. This tiny member of the great class of\r\nCuttle-fishes may perhaps have been more nearly allied to the modern\r\nSpirula than to the Nautilus. In any case, if, as seems altogether\r\nprobable it was, a mollusk, it must have been one of advanced type, and\r\nwith a highly complex structure, as well as the singular apparatus for\r\nflotation implied in a chambered shell with a siphuncle.\r\n\r\nNext to this among these primitive Mollusks are straight and spiral\r\nshells representing those delicate and beautiful animals of the modern\r\nseas, the Pteropods, or wing-footed Sea-snails, beautiful and graceful\r\ncreatures, the butterflies of the sea, and moving in the water with\r\nthe greatest ease and beauty by the aid of membranous fins, or wings,\r\nsometimes brightly coloured. These creatures abound in all latitudes\r\nin the modern ocean, and their delicate shells sometimes accumulate in\r\nbeds of \"Pteropod sand.\" They very early entered on the arena of marine\r\nlife, and have continued to this day.\r\n\r\nWe miss here the two great Molluscan groups of the creeping Sea-snails\r\nlike the limpet and whelk, and of the ordinary bivalves like the\r\noyster and cockle. Both are present in the lowest Cambrian, though in\r\nsmall numbers compared with their present abundance. Possibly they had\r\nnot yet appeared in the Etcheminian Sea, though the muddy and sandy\r\nbottoms, evidenced by its slates and sandstones, would seem to have\r\nafforded favourable habitats, and warrant the expectation that species\r\nmay yet be found.\r\n\r\nThe case was different with the little group of the Lamp-shells, or\r\nBrachiopods. These creatures, somewhat resembling the ordinary bivalves\r\nin their shelly coverings, were very dissimilar in their internal\r\nstructure, and once settled on the bottom they were attached for life,\r\nnot having even the limited means of locomotion possessed by the\r\nSea-snails and common bivalves. They collected their food wholly by\r\nmeans of currents of water produced by cilia, or movable threads, on\r\narms or processes within their shells. In this they resembled the young\r\nor embryo stages of some of the more ordinary Mollusks, though they are\r\nso remote from these in their adult condition that they have usually\r\nbeen placed in a distinct class, and some naturalists have thought\r\nit best to separate them from the Mollusks altogether. Their history\r\nis peculiar. Coming into existence at a very early date, they became\r\nvery abundant in early Palæozoic times, then gradually gave place to\r\nthe ordinary bivalves, and in the modern seas are represented by very\r\nfew species. Yet while in the middle period of their history they are\r\nrepresented by very many peculiar specific and generic forms. Some of\r\nthe earliest types, like Obolus and Lingula, persist very long, and\r\nthe latter has continued without change from the Early Cambrian to the\r\nModern period.\r\n\r\nThe great group of the Sea-stars and Sea-urchins appears only in a\r\nfew of its lower forms, and seems to be the only class represented by\r\nembryonic types. The coral animals are absent, so far as known. The\r\nJelly-fishes and their allies cannot be preserved as fossils, but some\r\npeculiar markings, at one time regarded as plants, are now supposed to\r\nbe trails made by the tentacles of creatures of this kind moving over\r\nmuddy bottoms. A few spicules indicate Sponges, and the ubiquitous\r\ngroups of the marine Protozoa, the Foraminifera and the Radiolaunus,\r\nare represented by shells scarcely distinguishable from those of modern\r\nspecies. The great and peculiar forms represented at this early time by\r\nCryptozoon and its allies seem long ago to have perished, and we shall\r\nhave to return to them in a later stage of our inquiry.\r\n\r\nTo sum up the little that we know of this earliest Palæozoic life:--It\r\nwas perfect of its kind, equally pregnant with evidences of design, and\r\nof the nicest and most delicate contrivance as the animal life of any\r\nlater time, and it presupposed vegetable life and multitudes of minute\r\norganic beings altogether unknown to us to nourish the creatures we do\r\nknow. As an example of this, a little Brachiopod or sponge nourished\r\nby the currents produced by its cilia, or a Jelly-fish gathering\r\nfood by its thread-like tentacles, or a Globigerina selecting its\r\nnourishment by its delicate gelatinous pseudopods, required an ocean\r\nswarming with minute forms of life, which probably can never be known\r\nto us, but every one of which must have been an inscrutable miracle of\r\norganization and vital function.\r\n\r\nLastly, with reference to our present subject, the Etcheminian fossils\r\ncarry life backward one whole great period earlier than the Lower\r\nCambrian, and appear to indicate that we are approaching a beginning\r\nof living things in the Palæozoic world. Much no doubt remains to be\r\ndiscovered, but it would seem that any future discoveries must fail to\r\nnegative this conclusion.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Huronian.\r\n\r\nIn whatever way the rocks immediately below the Cambrian may be\r\nclassified, it is certain that the next system in descending order\r\nis that to which Logan long ago gave the name Huronian, from its\r\ndevelopment on Lake Huron[12]--a name to which it is still entitled,\r\nthough there may, perhaps, be some grounds for dividing it into an\r\nupper and lower member.[13] To this sub-division, however, we need\r\nnot for the present give any special attention. In the typical area\r\nof Lake Huron the Huronian consists of quartzites, which are merely\r\nhardened sandstones, of slates which are muddy or volcanic-ash beds,\r\nof conglomerates or pebble-rocks, and of coarse earthy limestone.\r\nWith these rocks are deposits of igneous material which represent\r\ncontemporary volcanic eruptions. In other districts, as in New\r\nBrunswick, Newfoundland, etc., the beds have been considerably altered,\r\nand are locally more mixed with igneous products. The physical picture\r\npresented to us by the Huronian is that of a shore deposit, formed\r\nunder circumstances in which beds of pebbles and sand were intermixed\r\nwith the products of neighbouring volcanoes.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 12: Dr. G. M. Dawson, F.R.S., the present Director of the\r\nGeological Survey of Canada, whose judgment in this matter should be of\r\nthe highest value, holds that the original simple arrangement of Logan\r\nstill holds, notwithstanding the multitude of new names proposed by the\r\nWestern Geologists of the United States.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 13: Van Hise, \"Pre-Cambrian Rocks of North America.\" _Comptes\r\nRendus_, 5th Session International Geol. Congress 1891, p. 134. Also\r\n\"Report U.S. Geol. Survey, 1895.\"]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 15.--_Annelid Burrows, Hastings Series, Madoc._\r\n\r\n1. _Transverse section of Worm-burrow_--magnified, as a transparent\r\nobject.

The same, magnified.]\r\n\r\nSuch a formation is not likely to afford fossils in any considerable\r\nnumber and variety, even if deposited at a time of abundant marine\r\nlife. It is therefore not wonderful that we find little evidence of\r\nliving beings in the Huronian. In Canada I can point to nothing of this\r\nkind, except a few cylindrical burrows, probably of worms (Fig. 15),\r\nand spicules possibly of silicious sponges, which occur in nodules of\r\nchert in the limestones, traces of laminated forms like Cryptozoon\r\nor Eozoon (Fig. 17), and minute carbonaceous fragments which may be\r\ndebris of sea-weeds or Zoophytes. In rocks of similar age in the United\r\nStates, Gresley has recently discovered worm-burrows, and in Brittany\r\nthere are quartzite beds in which Barrois and Cayeux believe that they\r\nhave found tests of Radiolarians, Foraminifera and spicules of sponges,\r\nbut their organic nature has been denied by Rauff, of Bonn. The casts\r\nof Foraminifera, however, at least appear to be organic (Fig. 16), and\r\nit is quite likely that Cayeux may be able to verify his Radiolarians\r\nand sponges as well. Matthew's observations in New Brunswick in any\r\ncase establish their probability. Gümbel also recognises a species of\r\nEozoon in the equivalent rocks of Bavaria (see p. 213).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 16.--_Casts of Foraminifera, from the Huronian of\r\nBrittany._ (After Cayeux.)\r\n\r\nCompare with Globigerinæ on Fig. 12 and Archæospherinæ, Figs. 50-54.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 17.--_Cryptozoon or Eozoon from the Hastings\r\nSeries, Tudor, Ontario_ (natural size).\r\n\r\nFrom a specimen collected by the late Mr. Vennor, and now in the\r\ncollection of the Geological Survey, Ottawa. (See also Frontispiece and\r\nfigure of _Eozoon Bavaricum_, p. 213.)]\r\n\r\nIt is evident that here we have approached the limit of the higher\r\nforms of marine invertebrate life, having as yet nothing to show except\r\nworms and Protozoa. It is to be observed, however, that there may be\r\nsomewhere Huronian deposits formed in deep and quiet waters, which may\r\ngive better results, and that the unconformity between the Huronian and\r\noverlying Kewenian may indicate a lapse of time, of which monuments may\r\nyet be found.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Laurentian.\r\n\r\nLast of all we have the widely distributed Laurentian system of\r\nLogan, the oldest known to geologists, and which with the Huronian\r\nconstitutes the great Archæan group of formations of Dana and others.\r\nIn its lowest part this consists entirely of the stratified granitic\r\nrock known as gneiss, inter-bedded in some places with dark-coloured\r\ncrystalline rocks or schists. This may be a part of the first-formed\r\ncrust of our globe, produced under conditions different from those\r\nof any later rocks, and incompatible with the existence of life. The\r\nupper part of the Laurentian system, however, known in Canada as the\r\n\"Grenville Series,\" shows evidence of ordinary marine deposition in\r\nquiet waters, which may have been not unfavourable to the lower forms\r\nof marine life; and though its beds have been greatly changed by heat\r\nand pressure, we can still to some extent realize the conditions of a\r\ntime of comparative quiescence intervening between the underlying Lower\r\nLaurentian and the succeeding Huronian. This part of the system still\r\ncontains gneisses, bedded diorites, and other rocks which may have been\r\nvolcanic; but it has also quartzites and quartzose gneisses which must\r\nhave been sandstones or shales, thick limestones, beds of carbon now\r\nin the state of graphite or plumbago, and large beds of iron ore. Such\r\nrocks were in all succeeding formations produced under water and by\r\naccumulations of the remains of plants and the hard parts of animals,\r\nin strictly sedimentary beds, usually formed slowly and without\r\nmechanical disturbance. Hence we may infer that aquatic life at least\r\nexisted in this early period, and as there must have been land and\r\nwater, shallows and deep seas, there may have been scope for various\r\nkinds of living beings. The Grenville period is, however, separated\r\nfrom the succeeding Huronian by a great interval, occupied mainly by\r\nvolcanic ejections and earth-movements; so that our Grenville series,\r\nif it contains organic remains, may be supposed to afford species\r\ndiffering from those of the Huronian, and to form a sort of oasis in\r\nthe desert of the early pre-Cambrian world. We find that the limestones\r\nof this age actually contain remains supposed to be of animal origin.\r\nThey were first found in Canada, which contains the largest and best\r\nexposed area of these rocks in the world, and were brought under the\r\nnotice of geologists by the late Sir William E. Logan, the first\r\ndirector of the Geological Survey of that country.\r\n\r\nIn anticipation of details to be given later, the story of this\r\ndiscovery and its announcement may here be given in brief\r\n\r\nAs early as 1858, Sir William Logan had begun to suspect that certain\r\nlaminated bodies found in the Laurentian limestones of the Grenville\r\nseries might be of organic origin. The points which struck him were\r\nthese: They differed from any known laminated concretions; they\r\nresembled the \"Stromatoporæ\" or layer-corals of the lower Palæozoic\r\nrocks next in succession to the Laurentian and Huronian; the forms were\r\nsimilar in all the specimens, while the mineralizing substances were\r\ndifferent; they were found only in the limestone, and specially in one\r\nof the three great beds known in the formation, the upper limestone\r\nof the Grenville system. He exhibited specimens, and mentioned these\r\nprobabilities at the meeting of the American Association in 1859. In\r\n1862 it was suggested to Logan that the microscopic structure of some\r\nof the best preserved examples should be studied, and slices were\r\naccordingly prepared and submitted to the writer for examination.\r\nThey revealed in the calcareous laminæ of the specimens complicated\r\nsystems of canals or tubes filled with mineral matter, which appeared\r\nto be similar to those that Carpenter had recognised in the thickened\r\nparts of the shells of modern Foraminifera. This clew being followed,\r\nlarge numbers of slices of the supposed fossils and of the containing\r\nlimestone and of similar limestones from other parts of the world were\r\nexamined.\r\n\r\nThe writer also visited the localities of \"Eozoon,\" and studied its\r\nmode of occurrence _in situ_. The facts ascertained were communicated\r\nto the Geological Society of London, the name \"Eozoon Canadense\"\r\nbeing proposed for the species. Its description was accompanied by a\r\npaper on the geological conditions by Logan, and one on the chemical\r\nconditions by Sterry Hunt, while supplementary notes were added by\r\nthe late Dr. Carpenter and Professor T. Rupert Jones. Thus launched\r\non the scientific world, \"Eozoon\" at once became a fertile subject\r\nof discussion, and volumes of more or less controversial literature\r\nhave appeared respecting it. It still has its friends and opponents,\r\nand this may long continue, as so few scientific men are sufficiently\r\nacquainted on the one hand with the possibilities and conditions of the\r\npreservation of fossils in crystalline rocks, and on the other hand\r\nwith the structures of modern \"Protozoa.\" Thus, few are in a position\r\nto form an independent judgment, and \"Eozoon\" has met with some\r\nscepticism on the part both of biological and mineralogical specialists.\r\n\r\nTo aid us in forming an opinion, it will be necessary to consider the\r\noldest known strata of the earth's crust, and the evidence which they\r\nafford of the condition of the world when they were deposited. As\r\npreliminary to this, we may look at the following table of pre-Cambrian\r\nformations in Canada.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUCCESSION OF PRE-CAMBRIAN ROCKS IN CANADA, AS UNDERSTOOD UP TO 1896.\r\n\r\n(_In descending order._)\r\n\r\n    ----------------------------------------------------\r\n  PALÆOZOIC.\r\n  { Etcheminian in New Brunswick, _Kewenian_ or _Upper\r\n  {   Copper-bearing Series_ of Lake Superior, _Signal Hill\r\n  {   Series_ of Newfoundland. _Chuar_, and _Grand Cañon_\r\n  {   rocks of Colorado, etc.\r\n  {\r\n  {   Red and greenish Sandstones and Shales, Conglomerates,\r\n  {   Igneous Outflows and Ash-rocks.

Of this slaggy material there might, however, be\r\ndifferent layers more or less dense in proceeding from the interior to\r\nthe surface. This molten surface would, of course, radiate heat into\r\nspace; and as it would naturally consist of the least fusible matters,\r\nthese would begin to form a solid crust. We may imagine this crust at\r\nfirst to be smooth and unbroken, though such a condition could scarcely\r\nexist for any length of time, as the hardened crust would certainly be\r\ndisturbed by ascending currents from within, and by tidal movements\r\nwithout. Still, it might remain for ages as a spheroidal crust,\r\npresenting little difference of elevation or depression in comparison\r\nwith its extent. When it became sufficiently thick and cool to allow\r\nwater to lie on its surface, new changes would begin. The water so\r\ncondensed would be charged with acid substances which would begin to\r\ncorrode the rocky surface. Penetrating into crevices and flashing into\r\nsteam as it reached the heated interior, it would blow up masses and\r\nfragments of stone, and would perhaps force out and cause to flow over\r\nthe surface beds of molten material from below the crust, and differing\r\nsomewhat from it in their composition. All this aqueous work would\r\naccelerate the cooling and thickening of the crust, and at length a\r\nuniversal or almost universal heated ocean would envelope the globe,\r\nand so far as its surface was concerned, the reign of water would\r\nreplace that of fire. We may pause here to consider the probable nature\r\nof the earth's crust in this condition.\r\n\r\nThe substance most likely to predominate would be silica or quartz,\r\none of the lighter and most infusible materials of the crust; but\r\nwhich, heated in contact with alumina, lime, potash, and other earths\r\nand alkalis, forms fusible slags, enamels and glasses. One of these,\r\ncomposed of silica, alumina, and potash, or soda, was long ago named\r\nby the German miners felspar, a name which it still retains, though\r\nnow several distinct kinds of it are distinguished by different names.\r\nAnother is a compound of silica with magnesia and lime, forming the\r\nmineral known as Amphibole or Hornblende, and by several other names,\r\naccording to its colour and crystalline form. In many deep-seated\r\nrocks these minerals are formed together, and having crystallized\r\nout separately give a spotted and granular character to the mass.\r\nNaturally colourless, all these minerals, and especially the felspar\r\nand hornblende, are liable to be coloured with different oxides of\r\niron, the felspar usually taking a reddish, and the hornblende a\r\ngreenish or blackish hue. Now, if we examine a fragment of the oldest\r\nor fundamental gneiss or granite, we shall see glassy grains of quartz,\r\nreddish or white flat-surfaced crystals of felspar, and dark-coloured\r\nprisms of hornblende. When destitute of any arrangement in layers, the\r\nrock is granite; when arranged more or less in flakes or laminæ, it is\r\ngneiss, the structure of which may arise either from its having been\r\nformed in successive beds, or from its having been flattened or drawn\r\nout by pressure. These structures can be seen more or less distinctly\r\nin any ordinary coarse-grained granite, or with the lens or microscope\r\nin finer varieties.\r\n\r\nThe Lower Laurentian rocks of our section consist essentially of the\r\nmaterials above described, with a vast variety in the proportions\r\nand arrangements of the constituent minerals. There is, there-fore,\r\nnothing to prevent us from supposing that these rocks are really\r\nremains of the lower portions of the original crust which first formed\r\non the surface of our cooling planet, though the details of their\r\nconsolidation and the possible interactions of heat and heated water\r\nmay admit of much discussion and difference of opinion.\r\n\r\nBut after the formation of a crust and its covering in whole or in\r\npart with heated water, other changes must occur, in order to fit the\r\nearth for the abode of life. These proceeded from the tensions set\r\nup by the contraction and expansion of the interior heated nucleus\r\nand the solid crust--a complicated and difficult question, when we\r\nconsider its laws and their mode of operation, but which resulted in\r\nthe folding and fracturing of the crust along long lines which are\r\nparts of great circles of the earth, running in N.E. and S.W. and N.W.\r\nand S.E. directions; and these ridges, which in the earliest Archæan\r\nperiod must have attained to great height and very rugged outlines,\r\nformed the first rudiments of our mountain chains and continents. Those\r\nconstituting the Laurentian nucleus of North America--a very simply\r\noutlined continent--form a case in point (Fig. 18).\r\n\r\nThe elevation of these mountain ridges forced the waters to recede into\r\nthe lower levels. As the old psalm of creation has it,--\r\n\r\n    \"The mountains ascend,\r\n    the valleys descend into\r\n    the place Thou hast founded\r\n    for them,\"\r\n\r\nand so sea-basins and land were produced.\r\n\r\nMilton merely paraphrases this when he says,--\r\n\r\n    \"The mountains huge appear\r\n    Emergent, and their broad, bare backs upheave\r\n    Into the clouds; their tops ascend the sky.\r\n    So high as heaved the tumid hills, so low\r\n    Down sunk a hollow bottom wide and deep.\r\n    Capacious bed of waters.\"\r\n\r\nEnglishmen have been accused of taking their ideas of creation from\r\nMilton rather than from nature or the Bible. Milton had not the\r\nguidance of modern geology. His cosmology is entirely that of a close\r\nstudent of the Biblical narrative of creation. He is in many respects\r\nthe best commentator on the early chapters of Genesis, because he\r\nhad a very clear conception of the mind of the writer, and the power\r\nof expressing the ideas he derived from the old record. For the same\r\nreason he is the greatest bard of creation and primitive man, and\r\nsurprisingly accurate and true to nature.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 18.--_Map of Laurentian, North America._\r\n\r\nShowing the protaxis or nucleus of the continent.]\r\n\r\nThen began the great processes of denudation and sedimentation to which\r\nwe owe the succeeding rock formations. The rains descended on the\r\nmountain steeps, and washed the decaying rocks as sand, gravel and mud\r\ninto the rivers and the sea. The sea itself raged against the coasts,\r\nand cut deeply into their softer parts; and all the detritus thus\r\nproduced by atmospheric and marine denudation was spread out by the\r\ntides and currents in the bed of the ocean, and its gulfs and seas,\r\nforming the first aqueous deposits, while the original land must have\r\nbeen correspondingly reduced.\r\n\r\nThe sea might still be warm, and it held in solution or suspension\r\nsomewhat different substances from those now present in it, and the\r\nland was at first a mere chaos of rocky crags and pinnacles. But so\r\nsoon as the temperature of the waters fell somewhat below the boiling\r\npoint, and as even a little soil formed in the valleys and hollows of\r\nthe land, there was scope for life, provided that its germs could be\r\nintroduced.\r\n\r\nOn a small scale there was something of this same kind in the sea\r\nand land of Java, after the great eruption of Krakatoa, in 1883. The\r\nbare and arid mountain left after the eruption, began, in the course\r\nof a year, to be occupied by low forms of vegetable life, gradually\r\nfollowed by others, and verdure was soon restored. The once thickly\r\npeopled sea-bottom, so prolific of life in these warm seas, but\r\nburied under many feet of volcanic ashes and stones, soon began to be\r\nre-peopled, and is now probably as populous as before. But in this\r\ncase there were plenty of spores of lichens, mosses, and other humble\r\nplants to be wafted to the desolate cone, and multitudes of eggs and\r\nfree-swimming germs of hundreds of kinds of marine animals to re-people\r\nthe sea-bottom. Whence were such things to come from to occupy the\r\nold Archæan hills and sea-basins? and all our knowledge of nature\r\ngives us no answer to the question, except that a creative power must\r\nhave intervened; but in what manner we know not. That this actually\r\noccurred, we can, however, be assured by the next succeeding geological\r\nformation. We have seen that the granitic and gneissic ridges could\r\nfurnish pebbles, sand, and clay, and these once deposited in the\r\nsea-bottom could be hardened into conglomerate, sandstone and slate.\r\nBut beside these we have in the next succeeding or Upper Laurentian\r\nformation rocks of a very different character. We have great beds of\r\nlimestone and iron ore, and deposits, of carbon or coaly matter, now\r\nin the peculiar state of graphite or plumbago, and it is necessary\r\nfor us to inquire how these could originate independently of life. In\r\nmodern seas limestone is forming in coral reefs, in shell beds, and in\r\noceanic chalky ooze composed of minute microscopic shells; but only in\r\nrare and exceptional instances is it formed in any other way; and when\r\nwe interrogate the old limestones and marbles which form parts of the\r\nland, they give us evidence that they also are made up of calcareous\r\nskeletons of marine animals or fragments of these.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 19.--_Distribution of Grenville Limestone in\r\nthe district north of Papineauville, with section showing supposed\r\narrangement of the beds._]\r\n\r\nScale of Map 7 miles to one inch.

(See also Fig. 19A.)\r\n\r\nNow when we find in the Grenvillian series, the first oceanic group of\r\nbeds known to us, great and widely extended limestones, thousands of\r\nfeet in thickness, and rivalling in magnitude those of any succeeding\r\nperiod, we naturally infer that marine life was at work. No doubt\r\nthe primitive sea contained more lime and magnesia than the present\r\nocean holds in solution; but while this might locally favour the\r\naccumulation of inorganic limestones, it cannot account for so great\r\nand extensive deposits. On the other hand, a sea rich in lime would\r\nhave afforded the greatest facilities for the growth of those marine\r\nplants which accumulate lime, and through these for the nutrition of\r\nanimals forming calcareous shells or corals. Thus we have presumptive\r\nevidence that there must have been in the Upper Laurentian sea\r\nsomething corresponding to our coral reefs and shell-beds, whatever\r\nthis something may have been.\r\n\r\nThese limestones, however, demand more particular notice (Fig. 19).\r\n\r\nOne of the beds measured by the officers of the Geological Survey is\r\nstated to be 1,500 feet in thickness, another is 1,250 feet thick,\r\nand a third 750 feet; making an aggregate of 3,500 feet.[14] These\r\nbeds may be traced, with more or less interruption, for hundreds of\r\nmiles. Whatever the origin of such limestones, it is plain that they\r\nindicate causes equal in extent, and comparable in power and duration,\r\nwith those which have produced the greatest limestones of the later\r\ngeological periods. Now, in later formations, limestone is usually an\r\norganic rock, accumulated by the slow gathering from the sea-water,\r\nor its plants, of calcareous matter, by corals, foraminifera, or\r\nshell-fish, and the deposition of their skeletons, either entire or\r\nin fragments on the sea-bottom. The most friable chalk and the most\r\ncrystalline limestones have alike been formed in this way. We know of\r\nno reason why it should be different in the Laurentian period. When,\r\ntherefore, we find great and conformable beds of limestone, such as\r\nthose described by Sir William Logan in the Laurentian of Canada, we\r\nnaturally imagine a quiet sea-bottom, in which multitudes of animals of\r\nhumble organization were accumulating limestone in their hard parts,\r\nand depositing this in gradually increasing thickness from age to age.\r\nAny attempts to account otherwise for these thick and greatly extended\r\nbeds, regularly interstratified with other deposits, have so far been\r\nfailures, and have arisen either from a want of comprehension of the\r\nnature and magnitude of the appearances to be explained, or from the\r\nerror of mistaking the true bedded limestones for veins of calcareous\r\nspar.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 14: Logan: \"Geology of Canada,\" p. 45.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 19A.--_Attitude of Limestone at Côte St. Pierre_\r\n(see Map, p. 88).\r\n\r\n(_a_) Gneiss band in the Limestone, (_b_) Limestone with Eozoon. (_c_)\r\nDiorite and Gneiss.]\r\n\r\nAgain, in the original molten world, it seems likely that most of\r\nthe carbon present--at least, at the surface--was in the atmosphere\r\nin the gaseous form of carbon dioxide. This might be dissolved by\r\nthe rain and other waters; but we know in the modern world no agency\r\nwhich can decompose this compound and reduce it to ordinary carbon\r\nor coal, except that of living plants, which are always carrying on\r\nthis function to an enormous extent. We know that all our great beds\r\nof coal and peaty matter are composed of the remains of plants which\r\ntook their carbon from the air and the waters in past times. We also\r\nknow that this coaly vegetable matter may, under the influence of heat\r\nand pressure, when buried in the earth, be converted into anthracite\r\nand into graphite, and even into diamond. It is true that an eminent\r\nFrench chemist[15] has shown that graphite and hydrocarbons may be\r\nproduced from some of the metallic compounds of carbon which may have\r\nbeen formed under intense heat in the interior of the earth, by the\r\nsubsequent action of water on such compounds; but there is nothing to\r\nshow that this can have occurred naturally, unless in very exceptional\r\ncases. Now in the Grenvillian system in Canada there is not only a\r\nvast quantity of carbon diffused through the limestones, and filling\r\nfissures in other rocks, into which it seems to have been originally\r\nintroduced as liquid bitumen, but also in definite beds associated with\r\nearthy matter, and sometimes ten to twelve feet thick. The occurrence\r\nof this large amount of carbon warrants us in supposing that it\r\nrepresents a vast vegetable growth, either on the land or in the sea,\r\nor both.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 15: Henri Moissan, \"Proceedings Royal Society,\" June, 1896,]\r\n\r\nIn like manner, in later geological periods, beds of iron ore are\r\ngenerally accumulated as a consequence of the solvent action of\r\nacids produced by vegetable decay, as in the clay ironstones of the\r\ncoal formation and the bog iron ores of later times. Thus the beds\r\nof magnetic iron occurring in the Upper Laurentian may be taken as\r\nevidences, not of vegetable accumulation, but of vegetable decay.\r\n\r\nMay not also the great quantity of calcium phosphate mined in the\r\nGrenville series in Canada, indicate, as similar accumulations do in\r\nlater formations, the presence of organisms having skeletons of bone\r\nearth?\r\n\r\nWith reference to the carbon and iron ore of the Grenville series, I\r\nmay quote the following from a paper published in the _Journal of the\r\nGeological Society of London_ in 1870:--\r\n\r\n\"The quantity of graphite in the Upper Laurentian series is enormous.\r\nIn a recent visit to the township of Buckingham, on the Ottawa River,\r\nI examined a band of limestone believed to be a continuation of that\r\ndescribed by Sir W. E. Logan as the Green Lake Limestone. It was\r\nestimated to amount, with some thin interstratified bands of gneiss,\r\nto a thickness of 600 feet or more, and was found to be filled with\r\ndisseminated crystals of graphite and veins of the mineral to such\r\nan extent as to constitute in some places one-fourth of the whole;\r\nand making every allowance for the poorer portions, this band cannot\r\ncontain in all a less vertical thickness of pure graphite than from\r\ntwenty to thirty feet. In the adjoining township of Lochaber Sir W. E.\r\nLogan notices a band from twenty-five to thirty feet thick, reticulated\r\nwith graphite veins to such an extent as to be mined with profit for\r\nthe mineral. At another place in the same district a bed of graphite\r\nfrom ten to twelve feet thick, and yielding twenty per cent, of the\r\npure material, is worked. When it is considered that graphite occurs in\r\nsimilar abundance at several other horizons, in beds of limestone which\r\nhave been ascertained by Sir W. E. Logan to have an aggregate thickness\r\nof 3,500 feet, it is scarcely an exaggeration to maintain that the\r\nquantity of carbon in the Laurentian is equal to that in similar areas\r\nof the Carboniferous system. It is also to be observed that an immense\r\narea in Canada appears to be occupied by these graphitic and Eozoon\r\nlimestones, and that rich graphitic deposits exist in the continuation\r\nof this system in the State of New York; while in rocks believed to be\r\nof this age near St. John, New Brunswick, there is a very thick bed\r\nof graphitic limestone, and associated with it three regular beds of\r\ngraphite, having an aggregate thickness of about five feet.[16]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 16: Matthew, in _Quart. Journ. Geol. Soc._, vol. xxi. p. 423.\r\n\"Acadian Geology,\" p. 662.]\r\n\r\n\"It may fairly be assumed that in the present world, and in those\r\ngeological periods with whose organic remains we are more familiar than\r\nwith those of the Laurentian, there is no other source of unoxidized\r\ncarbon in rocks than that furnished by organic matter, and that this\r\nhas obtained its carbon in all cases, in the first instance, from the\r\ndeoxidation of carbonic acid by living plants. No other source of\r\ncarbon can, I believe, be imagined in the Laurentian period. We may,\r\nhowever, suppose either that the graphitic matter of the Laurentian\r\nhas been accumulated in beds like those of coal, or that it has\r\nconsisted of diffused bituminous matter similar to that in more\r\nmodern bituminous shales and bituminous and oil-bearing limestones.\r\nThe beds of graphite near St. John, some of those in the gneiss at\r\nTiconderoga in New York, and at Lochaber and Buckingham and elsewhere\r\nin Canada, are so pure and regular that one might fairly compare them\r\nwith the graphitic coal of Rhode Island. These instances, however, are\r\nexceptional, and the greater part of the disseminated and vein graphite\r\nmight rather be compared in its mode of occurrence to the bituminous\r\nmatter in bituminous shales and limestones.\r\n\r\n\"We may compare the disseminated graphite to that which we find in\r\nthose districts of Canada in which Silurian and Devonian bituminous\r\nshales and limestones have been metamorphosed and converted into\r\ngraphitic rocks not dissimilar to those in the less altered portions of\r\nthe Laurentian.[17] In like manner it seems probable that the numerous\r\nreticulating veins of graphite may have been formed by the segregation\r\nof bituminous matter into fissures and planes of least resistance, in\r\nthe manner in which such veins occur in modern bituminous limestones\r\nand shales. Such bituminous veins occur in the Lower Carboniferous\r\nlimestone and shale of Dorchester and Hillsborough, New Brunswick, with\r\nan arrangement very similar to that of the veins of graphite; and in\r\nthe Quebec rocks of Point Levi, veins attaining to a thickness of more\r\nthan a foot are filled with a coaly matter having a transverse columnar\r\nstructure, and regarded by Logan and Hunt as an altered bitumen.\r\nThese Palæozoic analogies would lead us to infer that the larger part\r\nof the Laurentian graphite falls under the second class of deposits\r\nabove mentioned, and that, if of vegetable origin, the organic matter\r\nmust have been thoroughly disintegrated and bituminized before it was\r\nchanged into graphite. This would also give a probability that the\r\nvegetation implied was aquatic, or at least that it was accumulated\r\nunder water.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 17: Granby, Melbourne, Owl's Head, etc., \"Geology of Canada,\"\r\n1863, p. 599.]\r\n\r\n\"Dr. Hunt has, however, observed an indication of terrestrial\r\nvegetation, or at least of subaërial decay, in the great beds of\r\nLaurentian iron ore. These, if formed in the same manner as more modern\r\ndeposits of this kind, would imply the reducing and solvent action of\r\nsubstances produced in the decay of plants. In this case such great\r\nore beds as that of Hull, on the Ottawa, 70 feet thick, or that near\r\nNewborough, 200 feet thick,[18] must represent a corresponding quantity\r\nof vegetable matter which has totally disappeared. It may be added that\r\nsimilar demands on vegetable matter as a deoxidizing agent are made\r\nby the beds and veins of metallic sulphides of the Laurentian, though\r\nsome of the latter are no doubt of later date than the Laurentian rocks\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 18: \"Geology of Canada,\" 1863.]\r\n\r\n\"It would be very desirable to confirm such conclusions as those above\r\ndeduced by the evidence of actual microscopic structure. It is to be\r\nobserved, however, that when, in more modern sediments, algæ have\r\nbeen converted into bituminous matter, we cannot ordinarily obtain\r\nany structural evidence of the origin of such bitumen, and in the\r\ngraphitic slates and limestones derived from the metamorphosis of\r\nsuch rocks no organic structure remains. It is true that, in certain\r\nbituminous shales and limestones of the Silurian system, shreds of\r\norganic tissue can sometimes be detected, and in some cases, as in\r\nthe Lower Silurian limestone of the La Cloche mountains in Canada,\r\nthe pores of brachiopodous shells and the cells of corals have been\r\npenetrated by black bituminous matter, forming what may be regarded as\r\nnatural injections, sometimes of much beauty. In correspondence with\r\nthis, while in some Laurentian graphitic rocks,--as, for instance,\r\nin the compact graphite of Clarendon,--the carbon presents a curdled\r\nappearance due to segregation, and precisely similar to that of the\r\nbitumen in more modern bituminous rocks, I can detect in the graphitic\r\nlimestones occasional fibrous structures which may be remains of\r\nplants, and in some specimens vermicular lines, which I believe to be\r\ntubes of Eozoon penetrated by matter once bituminous, but now in the\r\nstate of graphite.\r\n\r\n\"When Palæozoic land-plants have been converted into graphite, they\r\nsometimes perfectly retain their structure. Mineral charcoal, with\r\nstructure, exists in the graphitic coal of Rhode Island. The fronds of\r\nferns, with their minutest veins perfect, are preserved in the Devonian\r\nshales of St. John, in the state of graphite; and in the same formation\r\nthere are trunks of Conifers (_Dadoxylon ouangondianum_) in which the\r\nmaterial of the cell-walls has been converted into graphite, while\r\ntheir cavities have been filled with calcareous spar and quartz, the\r\nfinest structures being preserved quite as well as in comparatively\r\nunaltered specimens from the coal-formation.[19] No structures so\r\nperfect have as yet been detected in the Laurentian, though in the\r\nlargest of the three graphitic beds at St. John there appear to be\r\nfibrous structures which I believe may indicate the existence of\r\nland-plants. This graphite is composed of contorted and slicken-sided\r\nlaminæ, much like those of some bituminous shales and coarse coals; and\r\nin these there are occasional small pyritous masses which show hollow\r\ncarbonaceous fibres, in some cases presenting obscure indications of\r\nlateral pores. I regard these indications, however, as uncertain; and\r\nit is not as yet fully ascertained that these beds at St. John are\r\non the same geological horizon with the Grenville series of Canada,\r\nthough they certainly underlie the Cambrian series of the St. John or\r\nAcadian group, and are separated from it by beds having the character\r\nof the Huronian, and thus come, approximately at least, into the same\r\ngeological position.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 19: \"Acadian Geology,\" p. 535. In calcified specimens the\r\nstructures remain in the graphite after decalcification by an acid.]\r\n\r\n\"There is thus no absolute impossibility that distinct organic tissues\r\nmay be found in the Laurentian graphite, if formed from land-plants,\r\nmore especially if any plants existed at that time having true woody\r\nor vascular tissues; but it cannot with certainty be affirmed that\r\nsuch tissues have been found. It is possible, however, that in the\r\nLaurentian period the vegetation of the land may have consisted wholly\r\nof cellular plants, as, for example, mosses and lichens; and if so,\r\nthere would be comparatively little hope of the distinct preservation\r\nof their forms or tissues, or of our being able to distinguish the\r\nremains of land-plants from those of Algæ. The only apparent plant\r\nof the Laurentian to which a name has been given, _Archæophyton_ of\r\nBritton, from New Jersey, consists of ribbon-like strips, destitute\r\nof apparent structure, and which, if they are of vegetable origin,\r\nmay have belonged to either of the leading divisions of the vegetable\r\nkingdom. I have found similar flat frond-like objects in the limestone\r\nof the Grenville series, at Lachute, in Canada.\r\n\r\n\"We may sum up these facts and considerations in the following\r\nstatements:--First, that somewhat obscure traces of organic structure\r\ncan be detected in the Laurentian graphite; secondly, that the general\r\narrangement and microscopic structure of the substance corresponds with\r\nthat of the carbonaceous and bituminous matters in marine formations\r\nof more modern date; thirdly, that if the Laurentian graphite has been\r\nderived from vegetable matter, it has only undergone a metamorphosis\r\nsimilar in kind to that which organic matter in metamorphosed sediment\r\nof later age has experienced; fourthly, that the association of the\r\ngraphitic matter with organic limestone, beds of iron ore, and metallic\r\nsulphides, greatly strengthens the probability of its vegetable origin;\r\nfifthly, that when we consider the immense thickness and extent of\r\nthe Eozoonal and graphitic limestones and iron ore deposits of the\r\nLaurentian, if we admit the organic origin of the limestone and\r\ngraphite, we must be prepared to believe that the life of that early\r\nperiod, though it may have existed under low forms, was most copiously\r\ndeveloped, and that it equalled, perhaps surpassed, in its results, in\r\nthe way of geological accumulation, that of any subsequent period.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figs. 20 _and_ 21.--_Bent and dislocated Quartzite,\r\nin contorted schists interstratified with Grenville Limestone, near\r\nMontebello._\r\n\r\nThe Quartzites have been broken and displaced, while the schists have\r\nbeen bent and twisted. In the immediate vicinity the same beds may be\r\nseen slightly inclined and undisturbed.]\r\n\r\nLet us take, in connection with all this, the fact that we are dealing\r\nwith the deposits of the earliest ocean known to us--an ocean warm and\r\nabounding in the mineral matters suitable for the skeletons of humble\r\nanimals, and fitted to nourish aquatic plants. The conditions were\r\ncertainly favourable to an exuberant development of the lower forms\r\nof marine life; and in later times, when such conditions prevail, we\r\ngenerally find that life has been introduced to take advantage of them.\r\nThe prudent farmer does not usually allow his best pasture to remain\r\nuntenanted with flocks and herds, and the Great Husbandman of nature\r\nhas, so far as we know, been similarly careful.\r\n\r\nI add two sections showing the local disturbances of beds of quartzite\r\nand schist associated with the Grenville limestones (Figs. 20 and 21,\r\npage 103).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n               _PROBABILITIES AS TO LAURENTIAN LIFE, AND\r\n                    CONDITIONS OF ITS PRESERVATION_\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   V\r\n\r\n               _PROBABILITIES AS TO LAURENTIAN LIFE, AND\r\n                    CONDITIONS OF ITS PRESERVATION_\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have seen that the mineral constitution of the Upper Laurentian\r\naffords evidence that in this age there were already land and water,\r\nand that the processes by which the land is being worn down, and its\r\nmaterials deposited on the sea-bottom, were in full operation; while\r\nthe absence of any evidence of violent wave-action, and the presence of\r\nthick deposits of limestone, coaly matter, iron ore, and fine-grained\r\nbeds of sediment, indicates a time of rest and quiescence. All these\r\nconditions were favourable to the presence of life, and we should\r\nexpect to find in such a period some sign of its commencement.\r\n\r\nBut here we are met by a formidable difficulty. If the beds of the\r\nGrenville series were originally deposits in a quiet sea, they are, as\r\nnow existing in the old Laurentian hills and valleys, very much changed\r\nfrom their original condition. They have, in short, experienced the\r\nchanges known to geologists by the formidable word metamorphism,\r\nwhereby they have lost the more obvious characters of ordinary aqueous\r\ndeposits, and have assumed new and strange forms. Dr. Adams, of\r\nMontreal, has taken the pains to collect a number of chemical analyses\r\nof the gneisses and schists or crystalline slates of the Grenville\r\nseries, and finds that, however unlike to more modern shales and clays,\r\nthey have substantially the same chemical composition. Now if they were\r\noriginally such shales and clays, it has happened to them that the\r\ningredients of the clays have rearranged themselves in new forms and\r\nbecome crystalline. We are familiar in a small way with such changes\r\nwhen brick clay, over-heated in the kiln, becomes fused into slag\r\nor vitrified; and if such slag were allowed to cool very slowly, it\r\nwould present different kinds of crystalline minerals. We actually see\r\nchanges of this kind in the substance of bricks which have been long\r\nexposed to intense heat in the walls of furnaces. Now in the crust of\r\nthe earth, very old rocks, buried under newer deposits, and exposed\r\nto the heat of the interior molten rocks, experience such changes on\r\na great scale; and there is one kind of influence present in the\r\nbowels of the earth which we in our experiments cannot easily imitate\r\nor understand, namely, the action of superheated water prevented by\r\npressure from escaping as steam, and permeating the whole substance of\r\ndeposits, which are thus baked at a high temperature in presence of\r\nwater, instead of being exposed to mere dry heat, as in our kilns and\r\nfurnaces. The study of the partial changes which have passed on later\r\nsediments where in contact with volcanic masses once intensely heated,\r\nenables us to understand the greater and more extensive metamorphism\r\nof the oldest rocks. Thus a mere mud becomes glorified by metamorphic\r\ncrystallization into a micaceous schist. We have taken ordinary clay\r\nas an example; but under the same processes sand has been converted\r\ninto a compact quartzite, ordinary limestone into crystalline marble,\r\nclay-ironstone into magnetic iron ore, coal into graphite, and lavas or\r\nvolcanic ashes into hard crystalline granites, gneisses, or pyroxene\r\nrocks or hornblendic schists, according to their original composition.\r\nThere may exist portions of these old rocks which have been exempt\r\nfrom such alteration, but hitherto we have not been able to find them,\r\nand they are probably under the ocean bed, or deeply burled beneath\r\nlater rocks, while the parts exposed are precisely those which have\r\nby their crumpling and pressure, and the influence of internal heat,\r\nbecome most hardened and altered, and have therefore best resisted\r\ndenudation. We need not therefore be astonished if any organic remains\r\noriginally present in such rocks should have perished, or should have\r\nbeen subjected to such changes of composition and form as to have\r\naltogether lost their original characters. The searcher for fossils\r\nin such rocks has to expect that these can have been preserved only\r\nunder very rare and exceptional circumstances. We have now to consider\r\nwhat these circumstances are, and for simplicity may suppose that we\r\nare endeavouring to discover in a crystalline limestone the remains\r\nof animals having a skeleton of limestone, as is the case with most\r\nshell-fishes and corals, and with many Protozoa and marine worms. In\r\nregard to these, we have to consider what may happen to them when they\r\nare imbedded in calcareous marl or ooze, or the limestone which results\r\nfrom the hardening of such materials; and we have to bear in mind that\r\nsuch organisms usually consist of hard, stony walls or partitions,\r\nenclosing cavities originally filled with the soft parts of the animal\r\nwhich may be supposed to have disappeared by decay before or during the\r\nmineralization of its skeleton.\r\n\r\nSo long as the imbedding mass continues soft and incoherent, shells,\r\ncorals, etc., can be recovered in a condition similar to that of recent\r\nspecimens, except that they may have become bleached in colour and\r\nbrittle in texture, owing to the removal of organic matter intimately\r\nassociated with the lime, and that their cavities may have been filled\r\nwith sand or silt washed into them, or with calcite or calcareous spar\r\nintroduced in solution in water. But if the containing mass has become\r\na hard stone, the material filling the interior of our shell or coral\r\nhas experienced a similar change; and when we break open the stone,\r\nwe may obtain the specimen, now hard, solid, and heavy, but still\r\nshowing more or less of its outer surface and markings, and possibly to\r\nsome extent also its internal structure when it is sliced and studied\r\nunder the microscope. But if the whole mass has been metamorphosed,\r\nand has become crystalline, the contained fossil and its contents may\r\nhave experienced a similar change, and may have so coalesced with the\r\ncontaining matrix that it is no longer separable from it. Even in this\r\ncase, however, if the whole is reduced to a thin transparent slice\r\nand examined microscopically, some traces may be found of the external\r\nand internal limiting lines of the fossil, and even of its minute\r\nstructures, which often cause it to present an appearance granular,\r\ncellular, or otherwise different from that of the enclosing matrix. It\r\nrequires, however, both skill and care to detect organic remains in\r\nsuch circumstances, and they may often escape observation, except when,\r\nas in many old crystalline limestones, the fossils are darkened in\r\nwhole or in part with coaly matter derived from the decay of their own\r\norganic substance. The crystalline Trenton limestone of Montreal, used\r\nthere as a building stone, is an excellent example (Fig. 22).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 22.--_Section of \"Trenton Limestone\" (magnified)._\r\n\r\nShowing its composition of fragments of calcareous fossils.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 23.--_Diagram of different States of Fossilization\r\nof the Cell of a Tubulate Coral._\r\n\r\n(_a_) Natural condition, (_b_) Cell filled with calcite. (_c_) Walls\r\ncalcite, filling silica. (_d_) Walls silica, filling calcite. (_e_)\r\nBoth walls and calcite silica. All these conditions are found in the\r\nfossil corals of the corniferous Limestone of Canada--Middle Permian.]\r\n\r\nIt is otherwise, however, when the calcareous fossils have been filled\r\nor injected with some mineral matter different from the matrix, as, for\r\nexample, silica or some silicate, oxide or sulphide of iron. In this\r\ncase the texture, colour, or hardness of the filling appear different\r\nfrom those of the limestone, and may be seen in a fresh fracture or\r\npolished slice; or when the rock is weathered, the hard mineralizing\r\nsubstance may project from the surface of the specimens, or may be\r\ndisclosed by treating the surface with a weak acid. The figures here\r\ngiven may suffice to show some of these conditions of mineralization\r\nin ordinary limestones, and the effects which they produce (Fig. 23).\r\n\r\nThe mineral matters which thus aid in preserving fossils are of various\r\nkinds, and the whole subject is a very curious one; but for the present\r\nwe may content ourselves with two kinds of mineralization--that by\r\nsilicates and that by magnesian limestone or dolomite.\r\n\r\nFrom the bottom of modern seas the dredge often brings up multitudes\r\nof minute shells, especially those of the simple gelatinous Protozoa,\r\nknown as Foraminifera, whose internal cavities and pores have been\r\nfilled with a greenish mineral composed of silica, iron and potash,\r\ncombined with water (or, chemically speaking, a hydrous silicate of\r\niron and potassium), which is named _glauconite_ from its bluish-green\r\ncolour--a name which we shall do well to remember. In such compounds,\r\nbases of similar chemical properties often replace one another, so\r\nthat various glauconites differ somewhat in composition, the iron\r\nbeing in part often replaced by alumina or magnesia, and the potash by\r\nsoda. The combined water also differs somewhat in its percentage. When\r\nminute shells fossilized in this way are treated with an acid so as to\r\nremove the calcareous shell itself, the enclosed silicate remains as a\r\nbeautiful cast or core, representing all the forms of the interior,\r\nand any pores that may have penetrated the walls, and also perfectly\r\nrepresenting the soft gelatinous body of the animal which once tenanted\r\nthe shells (Fig. 24). (See also Fig. 25 at end of chapter.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 24.--_Cast of Cavities of Polystomella in\r\nGlauconite (magnified)._\r\n\r\nAfter a photograph from Dr. Carpenter, and mounted specimens from his\r\ncollection.]\r\n\r\nWhen we examine oceanic sediments of older date, we find similar\r\nfillings in limestones, chalks, and sandstones of various ages, some\r\nof the latter containing glauconite so abundantly as to bear the name\r\nof green-sands, from their colour; and in these older examples we more\r\nfrequently find alumina and magnesia occupying a large place in the\r\nmineralizing silicate. Fig. 24A gives two illustrations of this--one\r\na crinoidal stem from the Silurian of New Brunswick, injected with a\r\nsilicate of alumina, iron, magnesia and potash; the other a spiral\r\nshell from more ancient perhaps Cambrian rocks in Wales, filled with a\r\nsilicate apparently more nearly related to serpentine. Further examples\r\nwill be referred to in an appended note.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 24A.--(_a_) _Joint of Crinoid injected with a\r\nHydrous Silicate, Silurian, Pole Hill, New Brunswick._ (× 25.)\r\n\r\n(_b_) _Spiral Shell injected with a Hydrous Silicate allied to\r\nSerpentine, near Llangwyllog, North Wales,_ (× 25.)]\r\n\r\nWe may now consider shortly the relation of dolomite, or the mixed\r\ncarbonates of lime and magnesia, to the preservation of fossils. The\r\npresence of dolomite or magnesian limestone in these beds does not\r\naffect the conclusion as to their probable organic origin. This form of\r\nlimestone occurs abundantly in later formations, and is even forming in\r\nconnection with coral deposits in the modern ocean.\r\n\r\nDana has shown this by his observations on the occurrence of dolomite\r\nin the elevated coral island of Matea in Polynesia,[20] under\r\ncircumstances which show that it was formed in the lagoon of an ancient\r\ncoral atoll, or ring-shaped island, while he finds that coral and\r\ncoral sands of the same elevated reef contain very little magnesia.\r\nHe concludes that the introduction of magnesia into the consolidating\r\nunder-water coral sand or mud has apparently taken place--\"(1) In\r\nsea-water at the ordinary temperature; and (2) without the agency of\r\nany other mineral water except that of the ocean\"; but the sand and\r\nmud were those of a lagoon in which the saline matter was in process\r\nof concentration by evaporation under the solar heat. Klement has\r\nmore recently taken up this fact in the way of experiment, and finds\r\nthat, while in the case of ordinary calcite this action is slow\r\nand imperfect, with the aragonite which constitutes the calcareous\r\nframework of certain corals,[21] and at temperatures of 60° or over,\r\nit is very rapid and complete, producing a mixture of calcium and\r\nmagnesium carbonates, from which a pure dolomite more or less mixed\r\nwith calcite may subsequently result.[22]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 20: \"Corals and Coral Islands,\" p. 356, etc.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 21: Aragonite, like ordinary limestone, is calcium carbonate,\r\nbut its atoms seem to be differently arranged, so as to make it a\r\nless stable compound, and it has a different crystalline form. Some\r\ncalcareous organisms are composed of aragonite, others of ordinary\r\ncalcite.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 22:\"Bulletin Geol. Soc. Belgium,\" vol. ix. (1895, p. 3). Also\r\nnotice in _Geol. Mag._, July, 1895, p. 329.]\r\n\r\nI regard these observations as of the utmost importance in reference to\r\nthe relations of dolomite with fossiliferous limestones, and especially\r\nwith those of the Grenville series. The waters of the Laurentian ocean\r\nmust have been much richer in salts of magnesium than those of the\r\npresent seas, and the temperature was probably higher, so that chemical\r\nchanges now proceeding in limited lagoons might have occurred over\r\nmuch larger areas. If at that time there were, as in later periods,\r\ncalcareous organisms composed of aragonite, these may have been\r\ndestroyed by conversion into dolomite, while others more resisting were\r\npreserved, just as a modern _Polytrema_ or _Balanus_ might remain, when\r\na coral to which it might be attached would be dolomitized, or might\r\neven be removed altogether by sea-water containing carbonic acid. There\r\nis reason to believe that this last change sometimes takes place in\r\nthe deeper parts of the ocean at present. This would account for the\r\npersistence of Eozoon and its fragments, when other organisms may have\r\nperished, and also for the frequent filling of the canals and tubuli\r\nwith the magnesian carbonate.\r\n\r\nThe main point here, however, for our present purpose is that, when a\r\ncalcareous shell or skeleton has been thus infiltrated with a silicate,\r\nit becomes imperishable, so that any amount of alteration of the\r\ncontaining limestone short of its absolute fusion would not suffice\r\nto destroy an organism once injected with silicious matter. Thus the\r\noccasional persistence of silicified fossils in highly metamorphosed\r\nlimestones is in no respect contradictory to the general fact, that\r\nwhen not preserved by silicious infiltration, they have perished, and\r\nthis more especially in the case of those whose skeletons are composed\r\nof aragonite.\r\n\r\nCarrying these facts with us, the next question is, What manner of\r\nfossil remains should we expect to find in the Upper Laurentian rocks,\r\nsupposing that any such are therein preserved? The answer to this\r\nquestion follows at once from the facts as to the succession of life\r\nnoticed above. Only the marine invertebrates have been traced as far\r\nback as the oldest Cambrian, and only Worms, Sponges, and Protozoa\r\ninto the Huronian. We should therefore have no expectation of finding\r\nremains of any vertebrate animals or of any of the land invertebrates;\r\nand even allowing for the more favourable conditions, as compared\r\nwith the Huronian, evidenced by the great limestones and the abundant\r\ncarbon, we could scarcely expect anything higher than some of the\r\nlower types of invertebrate life, such as Worms, Hydroids, Corals and\r\nProtozoa. We have next to inquire what forms, possibly organic, have\r\nactually been found, and what information we can derive from them as to\r\nthe beginnings of life. Since, however, such discoveries as have been\r\nmade have been the result of much labour and scientific skill brought\r\nto bear on these old rocks, and are connected with the reputations of\r\nseveral eminent men, now deceased, we may first refer shortly to the\r\nhistory of the discovery of supposed fossils in the Laurentian rocks of\r\nCanada.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 25.--_Nature-print of an etched Specimen of Eozoon._\r\n\r\nShowing the laminæ, a part of the natural margin, near which passes a\r\ndiagonal calcite vein, and at the upper right-hand corner, fragmental\r\nmaterial with casts of Archæospherinæ.

They were\r\nunquestionably below and more ancient than the oldest fossiliferous\r\nCambrian rocks both in Europe and North America, and geologists had for\r\nthe most part contented themselves with regarding them as primitive\r\nrocks, destitute of any geological interest, much as some United States\r\ngeologists of the present day call them the \"Archæan complex,\" a name\r\nwhich the late Prof Dana has well characterized as a \"term of despair.\"\r\n\r\nLogan was, however, a man not to be daunted by an unsolved problem,\r\neven though the facts for its solution must be sought in a wilderness\r\nknown to few except adventurous trappers, hunters, and lumbermen; and\r\nhe soon learned that this ancient gneissic formation contained other\r\nrocks beside gneiss, more especially thick and extensive limestones,\r\nand that its beds seemed to have a definite arrangement, and could\r\nbe traced over great areas. He addressed himself, therefore, to\r\nthe problem of unravelling the tangled \"complex,\" and with a few\r\nhardy assistants, spent years in laboriously tracing its beds along\r\nriver courses and over mountains, and in mapping, in a manner never\r\npreviously attempted, its several members, designating at the same time\r\nthe whole by the term \"Laurentian,\" because it constituted the mass\r\nof the hills lying north of the St. Lawrence, called by old French\r\ngeographers the Laurentides, and separating the St. Lawrence Valley and\r\nthe region of the great lakes from Hudson's Bay and the Arctic Sea. In\r\nthis manner he laid a foundation, which still remains unshaken, for the\r\ngeology of the oldest rocks, and prepared the way for the discovery\r\nof the forms afterward named Eozoon Canadense. At the same time Dr.\r\nSterry Hunt, the chemist of the Survey, was examining chemically the\r\nrocks and minerals collected, and all Sir William's assistants were\r\ninstructed to search, more especially in the limestones, for anything\r\nbearing the aspect of fossils. On the other hand. Dr. Carpenter was\r\nindependently pursuing his studies of the humbler inhabitants of the\r\nmodern ocean, and of the manner in which the pores of their skeletons\r\nbecame infiltrated with mineral matter, and had kindly contributed\r\nspecimens to the collections of the writer in Canada. The discovery\r\nof this most ancient fossil was thus not the chance picking up of a\r\nrare and curious specimen, but the result of several combined lines of\r\nlaborious and skilful research.\r\n\r\nThe following notice of the persons and incidents connected with its\r\ndiscovery is taken from a previous publication of the writer, with only\r\na little alteration in terms to suit it to the present date.\r\n\r\nThe first specimens of Eozoon ever procured, in so far as known, were\r\ncollected at Burgess, in Ontario, by a veteran Canadian mineralogist.\r\nDr. Wilson of Perth, and were sent to Sir William Logan as mineral\r\nspecimens. Their chief interest at that time lay in the fact that\r\ncertain laminæ of a dark green mineral present in the specimens\r\nwere found, on analysis by Dr. Hunt, to be composed of a new hydrous\r\nsilicate, allied to serpentine, and which he named loganite, but\r\nwhich seems to be a mixture of different silicates. The form of this\r\nmineral was not suspected to be of organic origin. Some years after,\r\nin 1858, other specimens, differently mineralized with the minerals\r\nserpentine and pyroxene, were found by Mr. J. McMullen, an explorer in\r\nthe service of the Geological Survey, in the limestone of the Grand\r\nCalumet on the river Ottawa. These seem to have at once struck Sir W.\r\nE. Logan as resembling the Silurian fossils known as _Stromatoporæ_,\r\nor layer-corals, and at that time of quite uncertain nature, though\r\nsupposed to be allied to some kinds of modern corals. He showed them\r\nto Mr. Billings, the palæontologist of the Survey, and to the writer,\r\nwith this suggestion, confirming it with the sagacious consideration\r\nthat inasmuch as the Ottawa and Burgess specimens were mineralized\r\nby different substances, yet were alike in form, there was little\r\nprobability that they were merely mineral or concretionary. Mr.\r\nBillings was naturally unwilling to risk his reputation in affirming\r\nthe organic nature of such specimens; and my own suggestion was that\r\nthey should be sliced, and examined microscopically; and that if\r\nfossils, as they presented merely concentric laminæ and no cells, they\r\nwould probably prove to be protozoa rather than corals. A few slices\r\nwere accordingly made, but no definite structure could be detected.\r\nNevertheless, Sir William Logan took some of the specimens to the\r\nmeeting of the American Association at Springfield, in 1859, and\r\nexhibited them as possibly Laurentian fossils; but the announcement was\r\nevidently received with some incredulity. In 1862 they were exhibited\r\nby Sir William to some geological friends in London, but he remarks\r\nthat \"few seemed disposed to believe in their organic character, with\r\nthe exception of my friend Professor Ramsay.\" In 1863 the General\r\nReport of the Geological Survey, summing up its work to that time, was\r\npublished, under the name of the \"Geology of Canada,\" and in this, at\r\npage 49, will be found two figures of one of the Calumet specimens,\r\nhere reproduced, and which, though unaccompanied with any specific\r\nname or technical description, were referred to as probably Laurentian\r\nfossils (Figs. 26 and 27).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 26.--_Weathered Specimen of Eozoon from the Grand\r\nCalumet._ (Collected by Mr. McMullen.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 27.--_Cross Section of the Specimen represented in\r\nFig. 26._\r\n\r\nThe dark parts are the laminæ of calcareous matter converging to the\r\nouter surface.]\r\n\r\nAbout this time Dr. Hunt happened to mention to me, in connection with\r\na paper on the mineralization of fossils which he was preparing, that\r\nhe proposed to notice the mode of preservation of certain fossil woods\r\nand other things with which I was familiar, and that he would show me\r\nthe paper in proof, in order that he might have any suggestions that\r\noccurred to me. On reading it, I observed, among other things, that\r\nhe alluded to the supposed Laurentian fossils, under the impression\r\nthat the organic part was represented by the serpentine or loganite,\r\nand that the calcareous matter was the filling of the chambers. I took\r\nexception to this, stating that though in the slices before examined\r\nno structure was apparent, still my impression was that the calcareous\r\nmatter was the fossil, and the serpentine or loganite the filling. He\r\nsaid: \"In that case, would it not be well to re-examine the specimens,\r\nand to try to discover which view is correct?\" He mentioned at the same\r\ntime that Sir William had recently shown him some new and beautiful\r\nspecimens collected by Mr. Lowe, one of the explorers on the staff\r\nof the Survey, from a third locality, at Grenville, on the Ottawa.\r\nIt was supposed that these might throw further light on the subject;\r\nand accordingly Dr. Hunt suggested to Sir William to have additional\r\nslices of these new specimens made by Mr. Weston, of the Survey,\r\nwhose skill as a preparer of these and other fossils has often done\r\ngood service to science. A few days thereafter, some slices were sent\r\nto me, and were at once put under the microscope. I was delighted to\r\nfind in one of the first specimens examined, which happened to be cut\r\nparallel to the laminæ, a beautiful group of tubuli penetrating one of\r\nthe calcite layers. Here was evidence, not only that the calcite layers\r\nrepresented the true skeleton of the fossil, but also of its affinities\r\nwith the Foraminifera, whose tubulated supplemental skeleton, as\r\ndescribed and figured by Dr. Carpenter, and represented in specimens\r\nin my collection presented by him, was evidently of the same type with\r\nthat preserved in the canals of these ancient fossils. Fig. 28 is an\r\naccurate representation of the first seen group of canals penetrated by\r\nserpentine.\r\n\r\nOn showing the structures discovered to Sir William Logan, he entered\r\ninto the matter with enthusiasm, and had a great number of slices and\r\nafterwards of decalcified specimens prepared, which were placed in my\r\nhands for examination.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 28.--_Group of Canals in the Supplemental Skeleton\r\nof Eozoon._\r\n\r\nTaken from the specimen in which they were first recognised.\r\n(Magnified.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 29.--_Canals of Eozoon, from same specimen,_\r\n\r\n(Highly magnified.)]\r\n\r\nFeeling that the discovery was most important, but that it would be\r\nmet with determined scepticism on the part both of geologists and\r\nbiologists, I was not content with examining the typical specimens of\r\nEozoon, but had slices prepared of\r\n\r\nevery variety of Laurentian limestone, of altered limestones from the\r\nCambrian and Silurian, and of serpentine marbles of all the varieties\r\nfurnished by our collections. These were examined with ordinary and\r\npolarized light, and with every variety of illumination. Dr. Hunt,\r\non his part, undertook the chemical investigation of the various\r\nassociated minerals. An extensive series of notes and camera tracings\r\nwere made of all the appearances observed; and of some of the more\r\nimportant structures beautiful drawings were executed by the late\r\nMr. H. S. Smith, the then palæontological draughtsman of the Survey.\r\nThe result of the whole investigation was a firm conviction that the\r\nstructure was organic and probably foraminiferal, and that it could be\r\ndistinguished from any merely mineral or crystalline forms occurring in\r\nthese or other limestones.\r\n\r\nAt this stage of the matter, and after exhibiting to Sir William all\r\nthe characteristic appearances in comparison with such concretionary,\r\ndendritic, and crystalline structures as most resembled them, and also\r\nwith the structure of recent and fossil Foraminifera, I suggested that\r\nthe further prosecution of the matter should be handed over to Mr.\r\nBillings, as palæontologist of the Survey, and as our highest authority\r\non the fossils of the older rocks.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 30.--_Casts of Canals of Eozoon, in Serpentine._\r\n\r\nDecalcified and highly magnified.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 31.--_Group of finest Tubuli._\r\n\r\nHighly magnified, from a micro-photograph.]\r\n\r\nI was engaged in other researches, and knew that no little labour\r\nmust be devoted to the work and to its publication, and that some\r\ncontroversy might be expected. Mr. Billings, however, with his\r\ncharacteristic caution and modesty, declined. His hands, he said, were\r\nfull of other work, and he had not specially studied the microscopic\r\nappearances of Foraminifera or of mineral substances. It was finally\r\narranged that I should prepare a description of the fossil, which\r\nSir William would take to London, along with Dr. Hunt's notes, the\r\nmore important specimens, and lists of the structures observed in\r\neach. Sir William was to submit the manuscript and specimens to Dr.\r\nCarpenter, and also to Prof T. Rupert Jones, in the hope that these\r\neminent authorities would confirm our conclusions, and bring forward\r\nnew facts which I might have overlooked or been ignorant of Sir William\r\nsaw both gentlemen, who gave their testimony in favour of the organic\r\nand foraminiferal character of the specimens; and Dr. Carpenter in\r\nparticular gave much attention to the subject, and worked out the\r\nstructure of the delicate tubulation of the surfaces of the laminæ or\r\ncell-walls, which I had not distinguished previously, through a curious\r\naccident as to specimens. Mr. Lowe had been sent back to the Ottawa\r\nto explore, and just before Sir William's departure had sent in some\r\nspecimens from a new locality at Petite Nation, similar in general\r\nappearance to those from Grenville, which Sir William took with him\r\nunsliced to England. These showed in a perfect manner the tubuli of\r\nthe primary cell-wall, which I had in vain tried to resolve in the\r\nGrenville specimens, and which I did not see until after they had been\r\ndetected by Dr. Carpenter in London. Dr. Carpenter thus contributed in\r\na very important manner to the perfecting of the investigations begun\r\nin Canada, and on him fell the greater part of their illustration and\r\ndefence,[23] in so far as Great Britain is concerned.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 23: In papers by Dr. Carpenter, subsequently referred to.\r\nProf. Jones published an able exposition of the facts in the _Popular\r\nScience Monthly_.]\r\n\r\nThe immediate result was a composite paper in the _Proceedings of the\r\nGeological Society_, by Sir W. E. Logan, Dr. Carpenter, Dr. Hunt, and\r\nmyself, in which the geology, palæontology, and mineralogy of _Eozoon\r\nCanadense_ and its containing rocks were first given to the world.[24]\r\nIt cannot be wondered at that when geologists and palæontologists\r\nwere thus required to believe in the existence of organic remains in\r\nrocks regarded as altogether Azoic and hopelessly barren of fossils,\r\nand to carry back the dawn of life as far before those Cambrian rocks,\r\nwhich were supposed to contain its first traces, as these are before\r\nthe middle period of the earth's life-history, some hesitation should\r\nbe felt. Further, the accurate appreciation of the evidence for such a\r\nfossil as Eozoon required an amount of knowledge of minerals, of the\r\nmore humble types of animals, and of the conditions of mineralization\r\nof organic remains, possessed by few even of professional geologists.\r\nThus Eozoon has met with some negative scepticism and positive\r\nopposition--though the latter has been smaller in amount than might\r\nhave been anticipated, when we consider the novel and startling\r\ncharacter of the facts adduced. The most annoying element in the\r\ndiscussion has consisted in the liability of observers, only partially\r\ninformed, to confound our specimens with things of very different\r\ncharacter, from which we had taken pains to distinguish them.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 24: In _Quarterly Journal of Geological Society_, vol. xxii.;\r\n_Proc. Royal Society_, vol. xv.; _Intellectual Observer_, 1865; _Annals\r\nand Magazine of Natural History_, 1874; and other papers and notices.]\r\n\r\n\"The united thickness,\" says Sir William Logan, \"of these three great\r\nseries, the Lower and Upper Laurentian and Huronian, may possibly far\r\nsurpass that of all succeeding rocks, from the base of the Palæozoic to\r\nthe present time. We are thus carried back to a period so far remote\r\nthat the appearance of the so-called Primordial fauna may be considered\r\na comparatively modern event.\"[25] So great a revolution of thought,\r\nand this based on one fossil, of a character little recognisable by\r\ngeologists generally, might well tax the faith of a class of men\r\nusually regarded as somewhat faithless and sceptical. Yet this new\r\nextension of life has been very generally received, and has found\r\nits way into text-books and popular treatises. Its opponents have\r\nbeen under the necessity of inventing the most strange and incredible\r\npseudomorphoses of mineral substances to account for the facts. As\r\nmight have been expected, after the publication of the original paper,\r\nother facts developed themselves. Mr. Vennor found other and scarcely\r\naltered specimens closely allied to the Laurentian forms in the\r\nHastings series of Tudor, probably of Huronian age. Gümbel recognised\r\nthe organism in Laurentian rocks in Bavaria and elsewhere in Europe,\r\nand discovered a new species in the Huronian of Bavaria.[26] Eozoon was\r\nrecognised in Laurentian limestones in Massachusetts[27] and New York,\r\nand there has been a rapid growth of new facts increasing our knowledge\r\nof Foraminifera and other humble animals in the succeeding Eozoic and\r\nPalæozoic rocks. Special interest attaches to the discovery by Mr.\r\nVennor, and by Walcott and Matthew, to be mentioned in the sequel,\r\nand tending to bridge over the interval between the Laurentian fossil\r\nand those of the Lower Cambrian. Another fact, whose significance is\r\nnot to be over-estimated, is the recognition both by Dr. Carpenter\r\nand myself of specimens in which the canals are occupied by dolomite\r\nor by calcite like that of the organism itself I have made several\r\nvisits to the locality at Petite Nation originally discovered by\r\nMr. Lowe, in company with Dr. Carpenter, Dr. Bonney,[28] and other\r\nskilled observers, and have very carefully studied all the facts with\r\nreference to the mode of occurrence of the forms in the beds, and their\r\nassociation with layers of fragmental Eozoon, and have found that these\r\nare strictly in accordance with the theory that these old Laurentian\r\nlimestones are truly marine deposits, holding the remains of the sea\r\nanimals of their time.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 25: _Journal Geological Society_, February, 1865.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 26: _Ueber das Vorkommen von Eozoon_, 1866.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 27: By Mr. Bicknell at Newbury, and Mr. Burbank at\r\nChelmsford. The latter gentleman has since maintained that the\r\nlimestones at the latter place are not true beds; but his own\r\ndescriptions and figures lead to the belief that this is an error\r\nof observation on his part. The Eozoon in the Chelmsford specimens\r\nand in those of Warren, New York, is in small and rare fragments in\r\nserpentinous limestone.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 28: See an excellent account of one of these visits by Dr.\r\nBonney, _Geological Magazine_, 1895.]\r\n\r\nEozoon is not, however, the only witness to the great fact of\r\nLaurentian life, of which it is the most conspicuous exponent. In many\r\nof the Laurentian limestones, mixed with innumerable fragments of\r\nEozoon, there are other fragments with traces of organic structure of\r\na different character. There are also casts in silicious matter which\r\nseem to indicate smaller species of Foraminifera; and large laminated\r\nforms, apparently organic, yet distinct from Eozoon. Some of these must\r\nbe noticed in the following pages.\r\n\r\nOther discoveries also are foreshadowed here. The microscope may\r\nyet detect the true nature and affinities of some of the fragments\r\nassociated with Eozoon. Less altered portions of the Laurentian rocks\r\nmay be found, where even the vegetable matter may retain its organic\r\nforms, and where fossils may be recognised by their external outlines\r\nas well as by their internal structure. Thus the time may come when\r\nthe rocks now called Primordial shall not be held to be so in any\r\nstrict sense, and when swarming dynasties of Protozoa and other low\r\nforms of life may be known as inhabitants of oceans vastly ancient as\r\ncompared with even the old Primordial seas. Who knows whether even the\r\nland of the Laurentian time may not have been clothed with plants,\r\nperhaps as much more strange and weird than those of the Devonian and\r\nCarboniferous, as those of the latter are when compared with modern\r\nforests?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                          _THE DAWN OF LIFE_\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  VII\r\n\r\n                          _THE DAWN OF LIFE_\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the Grenvillian system, as represented in the vicinity of the\r\nOttawa River, perfect specimens of Eozoon are found in one only of\r\nthe principal limestones there exposed, and in certain layers of that\r\nlimestone, and they are associated with concretions and grains of the\r\ngreenish mineral serpentine, which, as we shall see, has much to do\r\nwith their preservation. As exposed on broken surfaces, the specimens\r\nconsist of concentric layers of greenish serpentine and white calcite,\r\nnot, however, even or uniform, as in ordinary concretions having\r\nconcentric structure, but often approaching and uniting with each\r\nother, so as to constitute wide flat chambers, and forming patches from\r\nan inch to nearly a foot in diameter, while some of the larger patches\r\nseem to coalesce or to become confluent. On weathered surfaces the\r\nserpentine laminæ often become brown, owing to the rusting of the iron\r\ncontained in them, and project above the general surface, in this case\r\nresembling very much the appearance of the layer-corals so plentiful in\r\nsome limestones of later date.\r\n\r\nThe external forms of Eozoon are at first sight not very obvious,\r\nas they adhere very closely to the containing rock; but the smaller\r\nspecimens, when entirely weathered out or disengaged by the solution of\r\nthe limestone in an acid, usually present the form of a broad inverted\r\ncone, like some modern sponges or the broader turbinate fossil corals\r\n(Fig. 32). The limestone having, like the other beds of the formation,\r\nbeen much compressed and folded, the specimens of Eozoon are sometimes\r\ncrumpled in these folds or broken across by small cracks or faults,\r\nwhich shift the laminæ slightly out of their places. The cracks thus\r\nformed are also sometimes filled with a fibrous variety of serpentine,\r\nknown to mineralogists as chrysotile and popularly as \"rock cotton\"\r\nor \"asbestus.\" It is finely fibrous, and of a silky lustre, and must\r\nhave been deposited by water in the cracks and fissures formed by the\r\nfracturing of the rock and the contained fossils, by movements taking\r\nplace after the whole was hardened. Accordingly these veins often cross\r\nnot only the rock, but also the serpentine and calcite layers of the\r\ncontained masses of Eozoon, without regard to the direction of their\r\nlaminæ, though sometimes they run parallel to the structure, the rock\r\nhaving broken more easily in that direction.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 32.--_Entire specimen of Eozoon, disengaged from\r\nthe matrix and showing its turbinate form, enclosed in the outline of a\r\nlarger specimen of similar form._\r\n\r\nBoth natural size, Côte St. Pierre. (Specimens in Peter Redpath\r\nMuseum.)]\r\n\r\nBearing in mind these general points of material form and appearance,\r\nwe may now proceed to inquire as to the following points: (1) _The\r\nstructures visible in the specimens_; (2) _The manner in which they are\r\nrepresented by different mineral substances, and how these are to be\r\naccounted for_; (3) _The explanation of the whole on the supposition\r\nthat we are dealing with an animal fossil_.\r\n\r\n(1) In regard to the first of these questions, I may quote here, with\r\nsome slight alteration, from a recent memoir of my own[29]:--\r\n\r\n[Footnote 29: _London Geological Magazine_, 1895.]\r\n\r\nIn recent years I have been disposed to attach more importance than\r\nformerly to the general form of Eozoon. The earlier examples studied\r\nwere, for the most part, imbedded in the limestone in such a manner\r\nas to give little definite information as to external form; and at a\r\nlater date, when Sir William Logan employed one of his assistants, Mr.\r\nLowe, to quarry large specimens at Grenville and Côte St. Pierre, the\r\nattempt was made to secure the most massive blocks possible, in order\r\nto provide large slabs for showy museum specimens.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 33.--_Weathered surface of Eozoon._ Showing\r\nsections of two funnels or tubes with limiting walls, Côte St. Pierre.]\r\n\r\nMore recently, when collections have been made from the eroded and\r\ncrumbling surfaces of the limestone in its wider exposures, it was\r\nfound that specimens of moderate size had been weathered out, and\r\ncould, either naturally or by treatment with acid, be entirely\r\nseparated from the matrix. Such specimens sometimes showed, either on\r\nthe surfaces or on the sides of \"funnels\" and tubes penetrating the\r\nmass (Figs. 33, 34), a confluence of the laminæ, constituting a porous\r\ncortex or limiting structure. Specimens of this kind were figured in\r\n1888, and I was enabled to add to the characters of the species that\r\nthe original and proper form was \"broadly turbinate with a depression\r\nor cavity above, and occasionally with oscula or pits penetrating the\r\nmass.\" The great flattened masses thus seemed to represent confluent or\r\novergrown individuals, often contorted by the folding of the enclosing\r\nbeds.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 34.--_Section of the Base of a specimen of Eozoon._]\r\n\r\nThis specimen shows an oscuilform, cylindrical funnel, cut in such\r\na manner as to show its _reticulated wall_ and the descent of the\r\nlaminæ toward it. Two-thirds of natural size. From a photograph. Col.\r\nCarpenter, also in Redpath Museum.\r\n\r\n[This illustration (from Prof. Prestwich's \"Geology,\" vol. ii. p. 21)\r\nhas been courteously lent by the Clarendon Press, Oxford.]\r\n\r\nThere are also in well-preserved specimens certain constant properties\r\nof the calcite and serpentine layers. The former are continuous,\r\nand connected at intervals, so that if the silicious filling of\r\nthe chambers could be removed, the calcareous portion would form a\r\ncontinuous skeleton, while the serpentine filling the chambers, when\r\nthe calcareous plates are dissolved out by an acid, forms a continuous\r\ncast of the animal matter filling the chambers (Fig. 36). This cast\r\nof the sarcodous material, when thus separated, is very uniformly\r\nand beautifully mammillated on the surfaces of the laminæ, and this\r\ntuberculation gradually passes upward into smaller chambers having\r\namœboid outlines, and finally into rounded chamberlets. It is also\r\na very constant point of structure that the lower laminæ of calcite\r\nare thicker than those above, and have the canal-systems larger and\r\ncoarser. There is thus in the more perfect specimens a definite plan of\r\nmacroscopical structure (Fig. 35).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 35.--_Structure of small specimen of Eozoon,\r\ncalcareous matter removed._]\r\n\r\n1. Natural size. 2. Acervuline cells of upper part. 3. Group of the\r\nsame coalescing into a lamina with tuberculated surface. 4. Laminæ with\r\ntuberculated surfaces in section. (See also Fig. 36.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 36.--_Decalcified Eozoon, in section, slightly\r\nenlarged._ Showing the character of the sarcodous laminæ now replaced\r\nby Serpentine.]\r\n\r\nThe normal mode of mineralization at Côte St. Pierre and Grenville is\r\nthat the laminæ of the test remain as calcite, while the chambers and\r\nlarger canals are filled with serpentine of a light green or olive\r\ncolour, and the finer tubuli are injected with dolomite. It may also\r\nbe observed that the serpentine in the larger cavities often shows a\r\nbanded structure, as if it had been deposited in successive coats, and\r\nthe canals are sometimes lined with a tubular film of serpentine, with\r\na core or axis of dolomite, which also extends into the finer tubuli of\r\nthe surfaces of the laminæ. This, on the theory of animal origin, is\r\nthe most perfect state of preservation, and it equals anything I have\r\nseen in calcareous organisms of later periods. This state of perfection\r\nis, however, naturally of infrequent occurrence.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 37.--_Finest Tubuli filled with Dolomite\r\n(magnified)._]\r\n\r\nThe finer tubuli are rarely perfect or fully infiltrated. Even the\r\ncoarser canals are not infrequently imperfect, while the laminæ\r\nthemselves are sometimes crumpled, crushed, faulted, or penetrated with\r\nveins of chrysotile or of calcite. In some instances the calcareous\r\nlaminæ are replaced by dolomite, in which case the canal-systems\r\nare always imperfect or obsolete. The laminæ of the test itself are\r\nalso in some cases replaced by serpentine in a flocculent form. At\r\nthe opposite extreme are specimens, or portions of specimens, in\r\nwhich the chambers are obliterated by pressure, or occupied only\r\nwith calcite. In such cases the general structure is entirely lost\r\nto view, and scarcely appears in weathering. It can be detected only\r\nby microscopic examination of slices, in parts where the granular\r\nstructure or the tubulation of the calcite layers has been preserved.\r\nAll palæontologists who have studied silicified fossils in the older\r\nrocks are familiar with such appearances.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 38.--_Plan of arrangement of Canals in Lamina of\r\nEozoon._]\r\n\r\nIt has been alleged by Möbius and others that the canal-systems and\r\ntubes present no organic regularity. This difficulty, however, arises\r\nsolely from imperfect specimens or inattention to the necessary results\r\nof slicing any system of ramifying canals. In Eozoon the canals form\r\nramifying groups in the middle planes of the laminæ, and proceed at\r\nfirst almost horizontally, dividing into smaller branches, which\r\nultimately give off brushes of minute tubuli running nearly at right\r\nangles to the surfaces of the lamina, and forming the extremely fine\r\ntubulation which Dr. Carpenter regarded as the proper wall (Figs. 38,\r\n39).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 39.--_Cross section of minute Tubuli, about 5\r\nmicroms in diameter (magnified)._]\r\n\r\nIn my earlier description I did not distinguish this from the\r\ncanal-system, with which its tubuli are inwardly continuous. Dr.\r\nCarpenter, however, understood this arrangement, and has represented\r\nit in his figures[30] (see also Fig. 28). It is evident that in a\r\nstructure like this a transverse or oblique section will show truncated\r\nportions of the larger tubes apparently intermixed with others much\r\nfiner and not continuous with them, except very rarely. Good specimens\r\nand many slices and decalcified portions are necessary to understand\r\nthe arrangement This consideration alone, I think, entirely invalidates\r\nthe criticisms of Möbius, and renders his large and costly figures of\r\nlittle value, though his memoir is, as I have elsewhere shown, liable\r\nto other and fatal objections.[31]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 30: \"Ann. and Mag. Nat. Hist.,\" ser. 4, xiii., p. 456, figs.\r\n3, 4.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 31: \"Museum Memoir,\" pp. 50 _et seq._]\r\n\r\nIt has been pretended that the veins of chrysotile, when parallel\r\nto the laminæ, cannot be distinguished from the minute tubuli\r\nterminating on the surfaces of the laminæ. I feel confident, however,\r\nthat no microscopist who has seen both, under proper conditions of\r\npreservation and study, could confound them. The fibres of chrysotile\r\nare closely appressed parallel prisms, with the optical properties of\r\nserpentine. The best preserved specimens of the \"proper wall\" contain\r\nno serpentine, but are composed of calcite with extremely minute\r\nparallel cylinders of dolomite about five to ten microms. in diameter,\r\nand separated by spaces greater than their own diameter (Figs. 40, 41).\r\nIn the rare cases where the cylinders are filled with serpentine, they\r\nare, of course, still more distinct and beautiful. At the same time,\r\nI do not doubt that observers who have not seen the true tubulation\r\nmay have been misled by chrysotile veins when these fringe the laminæ.\r\nMöbius, for instance, figures the true and false structure as if they\r\nwere the same.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 40.--_Cross section of similar Tubuli to those in\r\nFig. 39, more highly magnified, and showing granular character of the\r\ntest._\r\n\r\n(From camera tracings.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 41.--_Comparison of Tubulate Wall and Prisms of\r\nChrysotile in perspective._]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Canals of Eozoon._ (After Möbius.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Finer Canals of Eozoon._ (After Möbius.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Canals of modern Calcarina._ (After Carpenter.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Canals and Tubule of Tertiary Nummulina._ (After\r\nMöbius.)]\r\n\r\nFig. 42.\r\n\r\nFigures selected from Möbius, to show the resemblance of structures of\r\nEozoon to those of modern Foraminifera.\r\n\r\nProtest should here be made against that mode of treating ancient\r\nfossils which regards the most obscure or defaced specimens as typical,\r\nand those better preserved as mere accidents, of mineral structure. In\r\nTertiary Nummulites injected with glauconite it is rare to find the\r\ntubuli perfectly filled, except in tufts here and there; yet no one\r\ndoubts that these patches represent a continuous structure.\r\n\r\nI have remarked on previous occasions that the calcite constituting the\r\nlaminæ of Eozoon often has a minutely granular appearance, different\r\nfrom that of the surrounding limestone. Under a high power it resolves\r\nitself into extremely minute dots or flocculi, somewhat uniformly\r\ndiffused. Whether these dots are particles of carbon, iron, apatite, or\r\nsilicious matter, or the remains of a porous structure, I do not know;\r\nbut similar appearances occur in the calcareous fossils contained in\r\naltered limestones of later date. Wherever they occur in crystalline\r\nlimestones, supposed to be organic, the microscopist should examine\r\nthem with care. I have sometimes by this appearance detected fragments\r\nof Eozoon which afterward revealed their canals.\r\n\r\n(2) The second question requires us to consider the nature and\r\norigin of the substances constituting the specimens. Reference has\r\nalready been made to these in our fifth chapter, but they may be\r\nmore particularly noticed here in connection with the forms as above\r\ndescribed.\r\n\r\nThe calcareous laminæ are usually composed of clear translucent\r\ncalcite or calcium carbonate, though, as in the case of many later\r\nfossils, sometimes replaced by dolomite. It often has the fine granular\r\nappearance above referred to, but is nearly always crystalline, and\r\ntraversed by cleavage planes visible under the microscope.[32] This\r\ncrystalline structure, as every student of fossils knows, is very\r\ncommon in calcareous fossils of all geological ages. In the thicker\r\nlaminæ the canals traversing them and branching out in their substance\r\nare usually visible under a low power, except when they are filled with\r\ncalcite similar to that of the laminæ themselves. In this case they\r\ncan be seen only by very careful management of an oblique and subdued\r\nlight. When occupied with serpentine, this presents, in a thin slice\r\nunder transmitted light, a yellowish or brownish colour, and in a\r\nspecimen decalcified with an acid an opaque white appearance. In some\r\nof the larger threads of serpentine, as already stated, this mineral\r\nforms a thin outer cylinder with a core of calcite or dolomite within;\r\nbut this appearance is not common. Here and there, especially in the\r\nlower layers, a portion of a tube is filled with the harder mineral\r\npyroxene, which is in some respects similar to serpentine, except\r\nthat it contains lime as well as magnesia, and is destitute of water\r\nas an ingredient The finer tubuli into which the canals ramify are\r\nmost usually filled with dolomite or magnesian limestone, which has\r\na glossy appearance and higher lustre than the surrounding calcite,\r\nand so may be distinguished even in a transparent slice; but these\r\nfine dolomite threads are best seen when the surface of a slice is\r\ntreated with a dilute acid in the cold, in which circumstances the\r\ncalcite is dissolved, while the dolomite remains as tufts of delicate\r\ncylindrical hairs, presenting often a very beautiful appearance under\r\nthe microscope. Thus, as in many other fossils, what are supposed to\r\nhave been tubes and tubuli are found not empty, but filled with matter\r\neven harder and more resisting than the shell itself.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 32: Especially when the specimen has been heated or jarred in\r\nthe process of grinding or polishing.]\r\n\r\nSerpentine is a mineral which has been produced in different ways.\r\nSome igneous or volcanic rocks consist largely of compounds of silica\r\nand magnesia (olivine, etc.). When these rocks have become cold and\r\nare exposed to the action of water, they sometimes absorb this and\r\nbecome hydrated, thus passing into a kind of serpentine. When such\r\nrocks are pulverized and dispersed as volcanic ash, this falling into\r\nthe sea may be there hydrated, and may form serpentinous layers, or in\r\na fine paste or in solution may pass into the pores and cavities of\r\nshells and other organic things, acting, as we have seen, in the same\r\nmanner with ordinary glauconite. In like manner serpentine of this\r\norigin may form nodules or grains in limestones, in consequence of its\r\nparticles being aggregated together by concretionary attraction. We\r\nhave already seen that some comparatively modern so-called glauconites\r\nare essentially of the nature of serpentine, and we know that in the\r\nold Laurentian sea, salts of magnesia and magnesian minerals were\r\nabundant, so that serpentinous minerals might play a greater part than\r\nthey do in the modern seas. Loganite, the mineralizing substance of\r\nthe Burgess Eozoon, is different from serpentine, yet closely allied\r\nto the glauconites. The presence of pyroxene may be explained in a\r\nsimilar way. It is a frequent constituent of bedded volcanic rocks\r\nand of volcanic ashes, and beds of it occur in the Grenville series\r\nwhich once, no doubt, were ash-beds. Layers of it also occasionally\r\noccur from a similar cause in the limestone, and crystals of it have\r\nbeen deposited by water in the veins passing through the limestones\r\nand schists. Dr. Johnston-Lavis has described in the July number of\r\nthe _Geological Magazine_ for 1895 the aqueous deposition at ordinary\r\ntemperature of crystals of pyroxene and hornblende, in cavities and\r\ncrevices of bones included in an ash-bed of recent date, and in\r\npresence of calcite, apatite, and fluoride of calcium, as in the\r\nGrenville series. This is a modern instance analogous to that suggested\r\nabove. Hence all these minerals filling the cavities and canals of\r\nEozoon may have been deposited by water at ordinary temperatures, and\r\nhave no connection with the alteration to which the beds have been\r\nsubsequently subjected.\r\n\r\nI may add here that a Tertiary glauconite from the Calcaire Grossier\r\nof Paris analysed by Berthier[33] is essentially a serpentine composed\r\nof silicate of iron and magnesia, that Loganite as analysed by Hunt\r\ncontains thirty-one per cent, of magnesia, and that Hoskins has\r\nshown[34] that modern glauconites often contain large proportions of\r\nmagnesia and equivalent bases.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 33: Beudant, _Mineralogie_, xi. 178.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 34: _Geological Magazine_, July, 1895.]\r\n\r\nIt is also to be observed that independently of volcanic debris the\r\nreports of the _Challenger_ expedition show that in the deep seas\r\nthe decay of organic matter causes an alkaline condition of the\r\nsediments leading to the formation of alkaline silicates, while the\r\npresence of decaying volcanic dust furnishes the basis, whether of\r\niron, alumina, or magnesia, necessary for the making up of glauconite.\r\nI have also suggested that the assimilation by Protozoa making\r\ncalcareous skeletons, of the matter of Diatoms or humble plants having\r\nsoluble silica in their organization or of silicious Protozoa, and\r\nsponge germs, must set free much soluble silica as a rejected or\r\nexcrementitious matter which may contribute to the same result.\r\n\r\nIt is much more likely that the serpentine of the Laurentian limestones\r\nwas produced in these ways than that it resulted from the hydration\r\nof magnesian minerals after the rock was consolidated. In the former\r\ncase it would be in the most favourable conditions for mineralizing\r\norganisms as glauconites do in the modern seas. In the latter it would\r\ncause disturbances and changes of volume of which we have no evidence.\r\n\r\nWe thus find that the chemistry of the modern seas and that relating to\r\nthe preservation of fossils of various ages by silicious infiltrations\r\nlends great probability to the belief that serpentine played this\r\nrole in the oldest seas, though it would seem that dolomite was more\r\nsuitable to the filling of the extremities of the minute tubes and\r\ntheir finer terminations.[35]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 35: I have shown also that in the limestone containing Eozoon\r\nwe find layers holding concretions of serpentine alternating with\r\nothers holding crystals of dolomite, as if there were at some times\r\nconditions favourable to the deposition of silicate of magnesia, and at\r\nothers to that of the carbonate.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 43.--Stromatocerium rugosum, Hall, Ordovician.]\r\n\r\n(3) Our third question leads to the inquiry in what modern or ancient\r\nmarine animals we can find structures akin to those of our supposed\r\nLaurentian fossil. The first analogy which suggested itself to Sir W.\r\nLogan, and a very natural one, was that to the so-called layer-corals\r\n(Figs. 43 to 45) that abound in the Silurian, Ordovician, and Cambrian\r\nrocks, and which though undoubtedly fossil animals, have proved very\r\ndifficult to interpret or to assign to any known group. At first\r\nvaguely associated with the true corals, they were subsequently\r\nregarded as probably of more simple character, and as gigantic\r\nProtozoa; and later strong reasons have been assigned for giving them\r\nan intermediate place, as allied to those curious communities of humble\r\nanimals possessing simple stomachs and prehensile tentacles (Hydroids)\r\nwhich form some of the simpler corals (Millepores, etc.), and the\r\ncrusts (Hydractiniæ) which cover dead shells and other bodies in the\r\nsea. When examined microscopically, however, they differ very much\r\namong themselves, and it may be that some of them were Hydroids and\r\nsome Protozoa.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 44.--_Structures of Stromatopora._\r\n\r\n(_a_) Portion of oblique section, (_b_) Wall with pores, and coated\r\nwith crystals of quartz, (_c_) Thickened portion of wall with canals,\r\n(_d_) Laminæ and pillars.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 45.--_Tubular Structure of Cœnostroma, Silurian._]\r\n\r\nThe oldest that we at present know, and consequently the nearest in\r\ntime to Eozoon, impress us rather with the latter affinity. They\r\nare the fossils of the genus Cryptozoon of Hall (Fig. 7[36]), which\r\nform great masses filling certain beds of Upper Cambrian age, and\r\nwhich, when sliced and studied microscopically, are found to consist\r\nof concentric thin laminæ filled in between with a porous mass of\r\ncalcareous matter penetrated by an infinity of tortuous tubes. Forms of\r\nthis kind have been traced downward into pre-Cambrian beds in Colorado,\r\nand as we shall find in New Brunswick, into the Upper Laurentian itself.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 36: See Figs. 7 and 7a, pp. 37, 38; also Fig. 8 and\r\nMicroscopic slice, Fig. 59, at end.]\r\n\r\nThey present, however, structural differences from Eozoon, which\r\nrather conforms to the arrangements found in some Protozoa of smaller\r\nsize, and which, under the name of Foraminifera, have abounded in all\r\ngeological periods, and are excessively abundant in the modern ocean.\r\nThey may be defined as animals composed of a soft and apparently\r\nhomogeneous animal jelly known as protoplasm or sarcode. When carefully\r\nexamined, however, it is found to have a granular texture and to be\r\ndivisible into two layers, an outer and an inner, while it possesses\r\na little hollow vessel capable of expanding and absorbing the liquid\r\nmatter of the enclosing protoplasm, and of contracting so as to expel\r\nits contents. This seems to be the only organ of circulation and\r\nexcretion. There are, however, small cells or reproductive bodies in\r\nthe interior, varying in number, size, and development in different\r\nforms. The most remarkable property of these creatures is that of\r\nstretching out from the surface of the body threads or projections of\r\nthe protoplasm,[37] often of considerable length, and which serve at\r\nonce as organs of locomotion and prehension.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 37: Known as Pseudopodia.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Amœba._]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Actinophrys._]\r\n\r\nFrom original sketches.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Biloculina._ A many-chambered Foraminifer. Magnified as\r\na transparent object.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Polystomella._ A spiral Foraminifer. Magnified as an\r\nopaque object.]\r\n\r\nFig. 46.--Recent Protozoa.\r\n\r\nThese creatures are in some respects the simplest of animals, yet\r\nin other respects they present strange complexities. This is more\r\nespecially evident in their tests or coverings, made for the most part\r\nof limestone or calcium carbonate, but sometimes of grains of fine\r\nsand cemented together. These coverings are always perforated with at\r\nleast one orifice for the emission of the thread-like processes or\r\npseudopods, and often with a vast number of small pores for the same\r\npurpose. Sometimes the test or shell is smooth, sometimes beautifully\r\nsculptured externally. Sometimes it consists of a single chamber like\r\na ball or vase. More often, as the animals increase in size, they\r\nform additional chambers, and the body thus becomes divided into\r\nlobes connected with each other by necks passing through orifices in\r\nthe partitions. The chambers are arranged in rows or in spirals, and\r\nin other ways, giving a vast variety of forms, often presenting the\r\nmost beautiful patterns executed in the purest white marble, and the\r\nornamental parts constitute thickenings of the walls giving greater\r\nstrength, and are penetrated with microscopic canals communicating with\r\nthe soft substance of the animal.\r\n\r\nThese creatures abound in all parts of the ocean, from the surface\r\nto the greatest depths. The Foraminifera have also existed from\r\nthe earliest geological times, and in all the long ages of the\r\nearth's history seem to have retained the same structures and even\r\nornamentation; so that species from very old geological formations\r\nare often scarcely distinguishable from those now living, and must\r\nhave played precisely the same parts in the system of nature. One of\r\nthese functions is that of accumulating great thicknesses of calcareous\r\nmatter in the sea-bottom.\r\n\r\nThe manner in which such accumulation takes place we learn from what\r\nis now going on in the ocean, more especially from the result of the\r\nrecent deep-sea dredging expeditions. The Foraminifera are vastly\r\nnumerous, both near the surface and at the bottom of the sea, and\r\nmultiply rapidly; and as successive generations die, their shells\r\naccumulate on the ocean bed, or are swept by currents into banks, and\r\nthus in process of time constitute thick beds of white chalky material,\r\nwhich may eventually be hardened into limestone. This process is now\r\ndepositing a great thickness of white ooze in the bottom of the ocean;\r\nand in times past it has produced such vast thicknesses of calcareous\r\nmatter as the chalk and the nummulitic limestone of Europe and the\r\norbitoidal limestone of America. The chalk, which alone attains a\r\nmaximum thickness of 1,000 feet, and, according to Lyell, can be traced\r\nacross Europe for 1,100 geographical miles, may be said to be entirely\r\ncomposed of shells of Foraminifera imbedded in a paste of still more\r\nminute calcareous bodies, the Coccoliths, which are probably products\r\nof marine vegetable life, if not of some animal organism still simpler\r\nthan the Foraminifera.\r\n\r\nThere are, however, some sessile examples of these animals which\r\nattain to larger dimensions than the free and locomotive forms. As an\r\nexample of these we may take the _Polytrema_, which forms little hard\r\nred lumps on West Indian corals. Such a creature, beginning life as a\r\nlittle round spot of protoplasm, almost invisible, and protected with a\r\nlittle dome of carbonate of lime for the extension of its pseudopods as\r\nit grows in size, adds chamber to chamber in successive tiers till it\r\nassumes an appreciable size, all the chambers communicating with each\r\nother, while the outer ones are perforated with pores for extension of\r\nthe pseudopods. In one form (_Carpenteria_) the same end is secured by\r\nleaving an open space in the middle of the conical mass like the crater\r\nof a small volcano. It is with these larger and sessile forms that\r\nwe must compare Eozoon, though some of its minute structures rather\r\nresemble those of some smaller types.\r\n\r\nAll the creatures referred to above, notwithstanding the differences\r\nin their skeletons, resemble each other very closely in their soft\r\nparts, and come under the general name of Foraminifera, a name\r\nhaving reference to the openings by which the animal matter within\r\ncommunicates with the water without, for nutrition and respiration.\r\nSuch creatures may be regarded as the simplest and most ready media\r\nfor the conversion of vegetable matter into animal tissues, and their\r\nfunctions are almost entirely limited to those of nutrition. Hence it\r\nis likely that they will be able to appear in the most gigantic forms\r\nunder such conditions as afford them the greatest amount of pabulum\r\nfor the nourishment of their soft parts and for their skeletons. There\r\nis reason to believe, for example, that the occurrence, both in the\r\nchalk and the deep-sea mud, of immense quantities of the minute oval\r\nbodies known as Coccoliths along with Foraminifera, is not accidental.\r\nThe Coccoliths appear to be grains of calcareous matter formed in\r\nminute plants adapted to a deep-sea habitat; and these, along with\r\nthe vegetable and animal debris constantly being derived from the\r\ndeath of the living things at the surface, and falling to the bottom,\r\nafford the material both of sarcode and shell. Now if the Laurentian\r\ngraphite represents an exuberance of vegetable growth in those old seas\r\nproportionate to the great supplies of carbonic acid in the atmosphere\r\nand in the waters, and if the Eozoic ocean was even better supplied\r\nwith carbonate of lime than those Silurian seas whose vast limestones\r\nbear testimony to their richness in such material, we can easily\r\nimagine that the conditions may have been more favourable to a creature\r\nlike Eozoon than those of any other period of geological time.\r\n\r\nGrowing, as Eozoon may be supposed to have done, on the floor of the\r\nocean, and covering wide patches with more or less irregular masses,\r\nit must have thrown up from its whole surface its pseudopods to seize\r\nwhatever floating particles of food the waters carried over it There\r\nis also reason to believe, from the outline of certain specimens, that\r\nit often grew upward in inverted, conical, or club-shaped forms, and\r\nthat only the broader patches were penetrated by the tubes or oscula\r\nalready mentioned, admitting the sea-water deeply into the substance of\r\nthe masses. In this way its growth might be rapid and continuous; but\r\nit does not seem to have possessed the power of growing indefinitely\r\nby new and living layers covering those that had died, in the manner\r\nof some corals. Its life seems to have had a definite termination, and\r\nwhen that was reached, an entirely new colony had to be commenced.\r\nIn this it had more affinity with the Foraminifera, as we now know\r\nthem, than with the corals, though practically it had the same power\r\nwith the coral polyps of accumulating limestone in the sea-bottom, a\r\npower indeed still possessed by its foraminiferal successors. In the\r\ncase of coral limestones, we know that a large proportion of these\r\nconsist, not of continuous reefs, but of fragments of coral mixed with\r\nother calcareous organisms, spread usually by waves and currents in\r\ncontinuous beds over the sea-bottom. In like manner we find in the\r\nlimestones containing Eozoon, layers of fragmental matter which shows\r\nin places the characteristic structures, and which evidently represents\r\nthe debris swept from the Eozoon masses and reefs by the action of\r\nthe waves. With this fragmental matter small rounded organisms to be\r\nnoticed in the sequel occur; and while they may be distinct animals\r\nresembling the smaller modern species, they may also be the fry of\r\nEozoon, or small portions of its acervuline upper surface floated off\r\nin a living state, and possibly capable of living independently and of\r\nfounding new colonies.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 47.--_Slice of Limestone (magnified),_\r\n\r\n(_a_) Fragment of Eozoon with canals, (_b_) Fragments of granular\r\ncalcite, probably organic, (_c_) Structureless calcite with cleavage\r\nlines (Côte St. Pierre).]\r\n\r\nIt is only by a somewhat wild poetical licence that Eozoon has been\r\nrepresented as a \"kind of enormous composite animal stretching from the\r\nshores of Labrador to Lake Superior, and thence northward and southward\r\nto an unknown distance, and forming masses 1,500 feet in depth.\" We may\r\ndiscuss by-and-by the question of the composite nature of masses of\r\nEozoon, and we see in the corals evidence of the great size to which\r\ncomposite animals of a higher grade can attain. In the case of Eozoon\r\nwe must imagine an ocean floor more uniform and level than that now\r\nexisting. On this the organism would establish itself in spots and\r\npatches. These might finally become confluent over large areas, just\r\nas massive corals do. As individual masses attained maturity and died,\r\ntheir pores would be filled up with limestone or silicious deposits,\r\nand thus could form a solid basis for new generations, and in this way\r\nlimestone to an indefinite extent might be produced. Further, wherever\r\nsuch masses were high enough to be attacked by the breakers, or where\r\nportions of the sea-bottom were elevated, the more fragile parts of the\r\nsurface would be broken up and scattered widely in beds of fragments\r\nover the bottom of the sea, while here and there beds of mud or sand\r\nor of volcanic debris would be deposited over the living or dead\r\norganic mass, and would form the layers of gneiss and other schistose\r\nrocks interstratified with the Laurentian limestone. In this way, in\r\nshort, Eozoon would perform a function combining that which corals and\r\nForaminifera perform in the modern seas; forming both reef limestones\r\nand extensive chalky beds, and probably living both in the shallow and\r\nthe deeper parts of the ocean. If in connection with this we consider\r\nthe rapidity with which the soft, simple, and almost structureless\r\nsarcode of these Protozoa can be built up, and the probability that\r\nthey were more abundantly supplied with food, both for nourishing their\r\nsoft parts and skeletons, than any similar creatures in later times, we\r\ncan readily understand the great volume and extent of the Laurentian\r\nlimestones which they aided in producing. I say aided in producing,\r\nbecause I would not desire to commit myself to the doctrine that the\r\nLaurentian limestones are wholly of this origin. There may have been\r\nother animal limestone-builders than Eozoon, and there may have been\r\nlimestones formed by plants like the modern Nullipores or by merely\r\nmineral deposition.\r\n\r\nIts relations to modern animals of its type have been very clearly\r\ndefined by Dr. Carpenter. In the structure of its proper wall and its\r\nfine parallel perforations, it resembles the _Nummulites_ and their\r\nallies (Figs. 48, 49); and the organism may therefore be regarded as\r\nan aberrant member of the Nummuline group, which affords some of the\r\nlargest and most widely distributed of the fossil Foraminifera. This\r\nresemblance may be seen in Fig. 48.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 48.--_Section of a Nummulite, from Eocene Limestone\r\nof Syria._\r\n\r\nShowing chambers, tubuli, and canals. Compare this and Fig. 49 with\r\nFigs. 28 and 29.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 49.--_Portion of Shell of Calcarina._\r\n\r\nMagnified, after Carpenter, (_a_) Cells. (_b_) Original cell-wall with\r\ntubuli. (_c_) Supplementary skeleton with canals.]\r\n\r\nTo the Nummulites it also conforms in its tendency to form a\r\nsupplemental or intermediate skeleton with canals, though the canals\r\nthemselves in their arrangement more nearly resemble Calcarina, which\r\nis represented in Fig. 49. In its superposition of many layers, and in\r\nits tendency to a heaped-up or acervuline irregular growth it resembles\r\n_Carpenteria_, _Polytrema_ and _Tinoporus_, forms of a different group\r\nin so far as shell-structure is concerned. The large and curious sandy\r\nForaminifer from the Pacific dredged by Alexander Agassiz, and named\r\nby Goës, _Neusina Agassizi_, may also be mentioned as presenting some\r\npoints of resemblance.[38] It may thus be regarded as a composite\r\ntype, combining peculiarities now observed in two groups, or it may be\r\nregarded as a representative in the Nummuline series of Polytrema and\r\nTinoporus in the Rotaline series. At the time when Dr. Carpenter stated\r\nthese affinities, it might be objected that Foraminifera of these\r\nfamilies are in the main found in the Modern and Tertiary periods. Dr.\r\nCarpenter has since shown that the curious oval Foraminifer called\r\n_Fusulina_, found in the coal formation, is in like manner allied to\r\nboth Nummulites and Rotalines; and still more recently Mr. Brady has\r\ndiscovered a true Nummulite in the Lower Carboniferous of Belgium. This\r\ngroup being now fairly brought down to the Palæozoic, we may hope\r\nfinally to trace it back to the Primordial, and thus to bring it still\r\nnearer to Eozoon in time.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 38: _Bulletin Mus. Comp. Zoology_, vol. xxiii., No. 5, Dec.,\r\n1892.]\r\n\r\nThough Eozoon was probably not the only animal of the Laurentian seas,\r\nyet it was in all likelihood the most conspicuous and important as\r\na collector of calcareous matter, filling the same place afterwards\r\noccupied by the reef-building corals. Though probably less efficient\r\nthan these as a constructor of solid limestones, from its less\r\npermanent and continuous growth, it formed wide floors and patches\r\non the sea-bottom, and when these were broken up vast quantities of\r\nlimestone were formed from their debris. It must also be borne in\r\nmind that Eozoon was not everywhere infiltrated with serpentine or\r\nother silicious minerals; quantities of its substance were merely\r\nfilled with carbonate of lime, resembling the chamber-wall so closely\r\nthat it is nearly impossible to make out the difference, and thus is\r\nlikely to pass altogether unobserved by collectors, and to baffle\r\neven the microscopist. Although therefore the layers which contain\r\nwell-characterized Eozoon are few and far between, there is reason to\r\nbelieve that in the composition of the limestones of the Laurentian it\r\nbore no small part; and as these limestones are some of them several\r\nhundreds of feet in thickness, and extend over vast areas, Eozoon\r\nmay be supposed to have been as efficient a world-builder as the\r\nStromatoporæ of the Silurian and Devonian, the Globigerinæ and their\r\nallies in the chalk, or the Nummulites and Miliolites in the Eocene. It\r\nis a remarkable illustration of the constancy of natural causes and of\r\nthe persistence of animal types, that these humble Protozoans, which\r\nbegan to secrete calcareous matter in the Laurentian period, have been\r\ncontinuing their work in the ocean through all the geological ages,\r\nand are still busy in accumulating those chalky muds with which recent\r\ndredging operations in the deep sea have made us so familiar.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 50.--_Figures of Archæospherinæ._\r\n\r\n(1) Specimen with tubulated wall. (2 to 5) Casts in serpentine, Côte\r\nSt. Pierre and Long Lake]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                      _CONTEMPORARIES OF EOZOON_\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 VIII\r\n\r\n                      _CONTEMPORARIES OF EOZOON_\r\n\r\n\r\nThe name Eozoon, or Dawn-animal, raises the question whether we\r\nshall ever know any earlier representative of animal life. Here I\r\nthink it necessary to explain that in suggesting the name Eozoon for\r\nthe earliest fossil, and Eozoic for the formation in which it is\r\ncontained, I had no intention to affirm that there may not have been\r\nprecursors of the Dawn-animal. By the similar term. Eocene, Lyell\r\ndid not mean to affirm that there may not have been modern types in\r\nthe preceding geological periods: and so the dawn of animal life may\r\nhave had its grey or rosy breaking at a time long anterior to that in\r\nwhich Eozoon built its marble reefs. When the fossils of this early\r\nauroral time shall be found, it will not be hard to invent appropriate\r\nnames for them. There are, however, two reasons that give propriety\r\nto the name in the present state of our knowledge. One is, that the\r\nLaurentian rocks are absolutely the oldest that have yet come under\r\nthe notice of geologists, and at the present moment it seems extremely\r\nimprobable that any older sediments exist, at least in a condition to\r\nbe recognised as such. The other is that Eozoon, as a member of the\r\ngroup Protozoa, of gigantic size and comprehensive type, and oceanic in\r\nits habitat, is as likely as any other creature that can be imagined\r\nto have been the first representative of animal life on our planet.\r\nVegetable life may have preceded it, nay probably did so by at least\r\none great creative æon, and may have accumulated previous stores of\r\norganic matter; but if any older forms of animal life existed, it is\r\ncertain at least that they cannot have belonged to much simpler or more\r\ncomprehensive types. It is also to be observed that such forms of life,\r\nif they did exist, may have been naked protozoa, which may have left no\r\nsign of their existence except a minute trace of carbonaceous matter,\r\nand perhaps not even this.\r\n\r\nBut if we do not know, and perhaps are not likely to know, any\r\nanimals older than Eozoon, may we not find traces of some of its\r\ncontemporaries, either in the Eozoon limestones themselves, or other\r\nrocks associated with them? Here we must admit that a deep-sea\r\nForaminiferal limestone may give a very imperfect indication of the\r\nfauna of its time. A dredger who should have no other information as\r\nto the existing population of the world, except what he could gather\r\nfrom the deposits formed under several hundred fathoms of water,\r\nwould necessarily have very inadequate conceptions of the matter. In\r\nlike manner a geologist who should have no other information as to\r\nthe animal life of the Mesozoic ages than that furnished by some of\r\nthe thick beds of white chalk, might imagine that he had reached a\r\nperiod when the simplest kinds of protozoa predominated over all other\r\nforms of life; but this impression would at once be corrected by the\r\nexamination of other deposits of the same age: so our inferences as to\r\nthe life of the Laurentian from the contents of its oceanic limestones\r\nmay be very imperfect, and it may yet yield other and various fossils.\r\nIts possibilities are, however, limited by the fact that before we\r\nreach this great depth in the earth's crust, we have already left\r\nbehind in much newer formations all traces of animal life except a\r\nfew of the lower forms of aquatic invertebrates; so that we are not\r\nsurprised to find only a limited number of living things, and those of\r\nvery low type. Do we then know in the Laurentian even a few distinct\r\nspecies, or is our view limited altogether to Eozoon Canadense? In\r\nanswering this question, we must bear in mind that the Laurentian\r\nitself was of vast duration, and that important changes of life may\r\nhave taken place even between the deposition of the Eozoon limestones\r\nand that of those rocks in which we find the comparatively rich fauna\r\nof the Primordial age. This subject was discussed by the writer as\r\nearly as 1865, and I may repeat here what could be said in relation to\r\nit at that time:--\r\n\r\n\"In connection with these remarkable remains, it appeared desirable to\r\nascertain, if possible, what share these or other organic structures\r\nmay have had in the accumulation of the limestones of the Laurentian\r\nseries. Specimens were therefore selected by Sir W. E. Logan, and\r\nslices were prepared under his direction. On microscopic examination,\r\na number of these were found to exhibit merely a granular aggregation\r\nof crystals, occasionally with particles of graphite and other foreign\r\nminerals, or a laminated mixture of calcareous and other matters, in\r\nthe manner of some more modern sedimentary limestones. Others, however,\r\nwere evidently made up almost entirely of fragments of Eozoon, or of\r\nmixtures of these with other calcareous and carbonaceous fragments\r\nwhich afford more or less evidence of organic origin. The contents of\r\nthese organic limestones may be considered under the following heads:--\r\n\r\n  1. Remains of Eozoon.\r\n\r\n  2. Other calcareous bodies, probably organic.\r\n\r\n  3. Objects imbedded in the serpentine.\r\n\r\n  4. Carbonaceous matters.\r\n\r\n\"(1) The more perfect individuals of Eozoon do not constitute the mass\r\nof any of the larger specimens in our collections; but considerable\r\nportions of some of them are made up of material of similar minute\r\nstructure, destitute of lamination, and irregularly arranged. Some of\r\nthis material gives the impression that there may have been organisms\r\nsimilar to Eozoon, but growing in an irregular or acervuline manner\r\nwithout lamination. Of this, however, I cannot be certain; and, on the\r\nother hand, there is distinct evidence of the aggregation of fragments\r\nof Eozoon in some of these specimens. In some they constitute the\r\ngreater part of the mass. In others they are imbedded in calcareous\r\nmatter of a different character, or in serpentine or granular pyroxene.\r\nIn most of the specimens the cells of the fossils are more or less\r\nfilled with these minerals; and in some instances it would appear that\r\nthe calcareous matter of fragments of Eozoon has been in part replaced\r\nby serpentine.\"\r\n\r\n[I may add here that in the limestone at Côte St. Pierre there are in\r\nsome of the beds successive laminæ with grains of serpentine and others\r\nwith crystals of dolomite, and that both contain fragments of Eozoon.\r\nIt thus seems as if the magnesia associated with the limestone, at some\r\nstages of deposition took the form of silicate, and in others that of\r\ncarbonate. I may also observe here that I have detected fragments of\r\nEozoon in Laurentian limestone from New Brunswick, from Chelmsford in\r\nMassachusetts, from Warren County, New York, from Brazil, and from the\r\nAlps.]\r\n\r\n\"(2) Intermixed with the fragments of Eozoon above referred to are\r\nother calcareous matters apparently fragmentary. They are of various\r\nangular and rounded forms, and present several kinds of structure. The\r\nmost frequent of these is a strong lamination varying in direction\r\naccording to the position of the fragments, but corresponding, as\r\nfar as can be ascertained, with the diagonal of the rhombohedral\r\ncleavage. This structure, though crystalline, is highly characteristic\r\nof crinoidal remains when preserved in altered limestones. The more\r\ndense parts of Eozoon, destitute of tubuli, also sometimes show\r\nthis structure, though less distinctly. Other fragments are compact\r\nand structureless, or show only a fine granular appearance; and\r\nthese sometimes include grains, patches, or fibres of graphite. In\r\nCambro-Silurian limestones, fragments of corals and shells which have\r\nbeen partially infiltrated with bituminous matter, show a structure\r\nlike this. On comparison with altered organic limestones of the\r\nCambro-Silurian system, these appearances would indicate that, in\r\naddition to the debris of Eozoon, other calcareous structures, more\r\nlike those of crinoids, corals, and shells, have contributed to the\r\nformation of the Laurentian limestones.\r\n\r\n\"(3) In the hydrous silicate (Loganite) filling the chambers of a\r\nlarge specimen of Eozoon from Burgess, there are numerous small pieces\r\nof foreign matter; and the silicate itself is laminated, indicating\r\nits sedimentary nature. Some of the included fragments appear to be\r\ncarbonaceous, others calcareous; but no distinct organic structure\r\ncan be detected in them. There are, however, in the Loganite, many\r\nminute silicious grains of a bright green colour, resembling green-sand\r\nconcretions; and the manner In which these are occasionally arranged\r\nin lines and groups suggests the supposition that they may possibly\r\nbe casts of the interior of minute Foraminiferal shells. They may,\r\nhowever, be concretionary in their origin (Fig. 51).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 51.--Archæospherinæ from Burgess Eozoon. Grains\r\nincluded in Loganite.\r\n\r\n(Magnified.)]\r\n\r\n\"(4) In some of the Laurentian limestones submitted to me by Sir W. E.\r\nLogan, and in others from Arnprior on the Ottawa, there are fibres and\r\ngranules of carbonaceous matter which do not conform to the crystalline\r\nstructure, and present appearances quite similar to those which in\r\nmore modern limestones result from the decomposition of the algæ, etc.\r\nThough retaining mere traces of organic structure, little doubt would\r\nbe entertained as to their vegetable origin if they were found in\r\nfossiliferous limestones. In limestones of Upper Laurentian age, near\r\nSt. John, New Brunswick, more distinct fibres occur, and associated\r\nwith these beds Matthew has found what seem to be spicules of sponges,\r\nsome simple and others hexactinelled like those of Protospongia of the\r\nCambrian.\r\n\r\nThough the abundance and wide distribution of Eozoon, and the important\r\npart it seems to have acted in the accumulation of limestone, indicate\r\nthat it was one of the most prevalent forms of animal existence\r\nin the seas of the Laurentian period, the non-existence of other\r\norganic beings is not implied. On the contrary, independently of the\r\nindications afforded by the limestones themselves, it is evident that\r\nin order to the existence and growth of these large Rhizopods, the\r\nwaters must have swarmed with more minute animal or vegetable organisms\r\non which they could subsist. On the other hand, though this is a less\r\ncertain inference, the dense calcareous skeleton of Eozoon may indicate\r\nthat it also was liable to the attacks of animal enemies. It is also\r\npossible that the growth of Eozoon or the deposition of the serpentine\r\nand pyroxene in which its remains have been preserved, or both, may\r\nhave been connected with certain oceanic depths and conditions, and\r\nthat we have as yet revealed to us the life of only certain stations in\r\nthe Laurentian seas. Whatever conjectures we may form on these more\r\nproblematic points, the observations above detailed appear to establish\r\nthe following conclusions:--\r\n\r\nFirst, that in the Laurentian period, as in subsequent geological\r\nepochs, the Rhizopods were important agents in the accumulation of\r\nbeds of limestone; and secondly, that in this early period these low\r\nforms of animal life attained to a development, in point of magnitude\r\nand complexity, unexampled, in so far as yet known, in the succeeding\r\nages of the earth's history. This early culmination of the Rhizopods is\r\nin accordance with one of the great laws of the succession of living\r\nbeings, ascertained from the study of the introduction and progress of\r\nother groups; and, should it prove that these great Protozoans were\r\nreally the dominant type of animals in the Laurentian period, this fact\r\nmight be regarded as an indication that in these ancient rocks we may\r\nactually have the records of the first appearance of animal life on our\r\nplanet.\r\n\r\nWith reference to the first of the above heads, I have now to state\r\nthat it seems quite certain that the upper and younger portions of\r\nthe masses of Eozoon often passed into the acervuline form, and the\r\nperiod in which this change took place seems to have depended on\r\ncircumstances. In some specimens there are only a few regular layers,\r\nand then a heap of irregular cells. In other cases a hundred or more\r\nregular layers were formed; but even in this case little groups of\r\nirregular cells occurred at certain points near the surface. I have\r\nalso found some masses clearly not fragmental which consist altogether\r\nof acervuline cells. A specimen of this kind is represented in Fig. 52.\r\nIt is oval in outline, enclosed in a nodule of serpentine, about three\r\ninches in length, wholly made up of rounded or cylindrical cells, the\r\nwalls of which have a beautiful tubular structure, but there is little\r\nor no supplemental skeleton. Whether this is a portion accidentally\r\nbroken off from the top of a mass of Eozoon, or a peculiar varietal\r\nform, or a distinct species, it would be difficult to determine. In\r\nthe meantime I have described it as a variety, \"_acervulina_\" of the\r\nspecies Eozoon Canadense. It admits of comparison with a fragment\r\nfigured by Dr. Carpenter, which he compares with the chamberlets and\r\ntubes of _Nummulites lævigata_ of the Eocene.[39] Another variety\r\nalso, from Petite Nation, shows extremely thin laminæ, closely placed\r\ntogether and very massive, and with little supplemental skeleton. This\r\nmay be allied to the last, and may be named variety \"_minor_.\"[40]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 39: _Proceedings of Geological Society_, 1875.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 40: _Annals and Magazine of Natural History_, Sen 4, vol.\r\nxiii. p. 457.]\r\n\r\nAll this, however, has nothing to do with the layers of fragments of\r\nEozoon which are scattered through the Laurentian limestones. In these\r\nthe fossil is sometimes preserved in the ordinary manner, with its\r\ncavities filled with serpentine, and the thicker parts of the skeleton\r\nhaving their canals filled with this substance. In this case the\r\nchambers may have been occupied with serpentine before it was broken\r\nup. At St. Pierre there are distinct layers of this kind, from half an\r\ninch to several inches in thickness, regularly interstratified with\r\nthe ordinary limestone. In other layers no serpentine occurs, but the\r\ninterstices of the fragments are filled with crystalline dolomite or\r\nmagnesian limestone, which has also penetrated the canals; and there\r\nare indications, though less manifest, that some at least of the layers\r\nof pure limestone are composed of fragmental Eozoon.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 52.--_Acervuline Variety of Eozoon, Côte St.\r\nPierre._\r\n\r\n(_a_) General form, half natural size. (_b_) Portion of cellular\r\ninterior, magnified, showing the course of the tubuli.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 53.--_Archæospherinæ from Côte St. Pierre._\r\n\r\n(_a_) Specimens dissolved out by acid, the lower one showing interior\r\nsepta. (_b_) Specimens seen in section.]\r\n\r\nIn the Laurentian limestone of Wentworth, belonging apparently to the\r\nsame band with that of St. Pierre, there are many small rounded pieces\r\nof limestone, evidently the debris of some older rock, broken up and\r\nrounded by attrition. In some of these fragments the structure of\r\nEozoon may be plainly perceived. This shows that still older limestones\r\ncomposed of Eozoon were at that time undergoing waste, and carries our\r\nview of the existence of this fossil back to the very beginning of the\r\nGrenville series of the Laurentian.\r\n\r\nWith respect to organic fragments not showing the structure of Eozoon,\r\nI have not as yet been able to refer these to any definite origin. Some\r\nof them may be simply thick portions of the shell of Eozoon with their\r\npores filled with calcite, so as to present a homogeneous appearance.\r\nOthers have much the appearance of fragments of such Primordial forms\r\nas _Archæocyathus_, now usually regarded as corals or sponges; but\r\nafter much careful search, I have thus far been unable to say more than\r\nI could say in 1865.\r\n\r\nIt is different, however, with the round cells infiltrated with\r\nserpentine and with the silicious grains included in the loganite.\r\nFig. 53 shows such bodies found mixed with fragmental Eozoon and in\r\nseparate thin layers at Côte St. Pierre. In Fig. 51, I have shown\r\nsome of the singular grains found in the loganite occupying the\r\nchambers of Eozoon from Burgess, and in Fig. 54 some remarkable forms\r\nof this kind found in the limestones of Long Lake and Wentworth. All\r\nthese, I think, are essentially of the same nature, namely, chambers\r\noriginally invested with a tubulated wall like Eozoon, and aggregated\r\nin groups, sometimes in a linear manner, sometimes spirally, like those\r\nGlobigerinæ which constitute the mass of modern deep-sea dredgings and\r\nalso of the chalk.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 54.--_Archæospherinæ from Long Lake Limestone._]\r\n\r\n(Magnified.)\r\n\r\n(_a_) Single cell, showing tubulated wall. (_b, c_) Portions of same\r\nmore highly magnified, (_d_) Casts decalcified, and showing casts of\r\ntubules.\r\n\r\nThese bodies occur dispersed in the limestone, arranged in thin layers\r\nparallel to the bedding or sometimes in the large chamber-cavities of\r\nEozoon. They are so variable in size and form that it is not unlikely\r\nthey may be of different origins. The most probable of these may be\r\nthus stated. First, they may in some cases be the looser superficial\r\nparts of the surface of Eozoon broken up into little groups of cells.\r\nSecondly, they may be few-celled germs or buds given off from Eozoon.\r\nThis would correspond with what Carpenter, and more recently Brady and\r\nLester, have observed in the case of some of the larger of the modern\r\nForaminifera. Thirdly, they may be smaller Foraminifera, structurally\r\nallied to Eozoon, but in habit of growth resembling those little\r\nglobe-shaped forms which, as already stated, abound in chalk and in the\r\nmodern ocean. The latter view I should regard as highly probable in the\r\ncase of many of them; and I have proposed for them, in consequence, and\r\nas a convenient name, _Archæospherinæ_ or ancient spherical animals.\r\nCarbonaceous matter is rare in the true Eozoon limestones, and, as\r\nalready stated, I would refer the Laurentian graphite or plumbago\r\nmainly to plants.\r\n\r\nDr. Gümbel, the Director of the Geological Survey of Bavaria, is one of\r\nthe most active and widely informed of European geologists, combining\r\nEuropean knowledge with an extensive acquaintance with the larger and\r\nin some respects more typical areas of the older rocks in America, and\r\nstratigraphical geology with enthusiastic interest in the microscopic\r\nstructures of fossils. He at once, and in a most able manner, took up\r\nthe question of the application of the discoveries in Canada to the\r\nrocks of Bavaria. The spirit in which he did so may be inferred from\r\nthe following extract:--\r\n\r\n\"The discovery of organic remains in the crystalline limestones of the\r\nancient gneiss of Canada, for which we are indebted to the researches\r\nof Sir William Logan and his colleagues, and to the careful microscopic\r\ninvestigations of Drs. Dawson and Carpenter, must be regarded as\r\nopening a new era in geological science.\r\n\r\n\"This discovery overturns at once the notions hitherto commonly\r\nentertained with regard to the origin of the stratified primary\r\nlimestones, and their accompanying gneissic and quartzose strata,\r\nincluded under the general name of primitive crystalline schists. It\r\nshows us that these crystalline stratified rocks, of the so-called\r\nprimary system, are only a backward prolongation of the chain of\r\nfossiliferous strata; the elements of which were deposited as oceanic\r\nsediment, like the clay-slates, limestones, and sandstones of the\r\nPalæozoic formations, and under similar conditions, though at a time\r\nfar more remote, and more favourable to the generation of crystalline\r\nmineral compounds.\r\n\r\n\"In this discovery of organic remains in the primary rocks, we hail\r\nwith joy the dawn of a new epoch in the critical history of these\r\nearlier formations. Already in its light, the primeval geological time\r\nis seen to be everywhere animated, and peopled with new animal forms\r\nof whose very existence we had previously no suspicion. Life, which\r\nhad hitherto been supposed to have first appeared in the Primordial\r\ndivision of the Silurian period, is now seen to be immeasurably\r\nlengthened beyond its former limit, and to embrace in its domain the\r\nmost ancient known portions of the earth's crust. It would almost\r\nseem as if organic life had been awakened simultaneously with the\r\nsolidification of the earth's crust.\"\r\n\r\nGümbel has described from limestones of Laurentian age in various parts\r\nof Europe forms referable to Eozoon or to Archæospherinæ, and I have\r\nfound fragmental Eozoon in specimens collected by Favre in the supposed\r\nArchæan nucleus of the Alps.\r\n\r\nGümbel also found in the Finnish and Bavarian limestones knotted\r\nchambers, like those of Wentworth above mentioned (Fig. 55), which he\r\nregards as belonging to some other organism than Eozoon; and flocculi\r\nhaving tubes, pores, and reticulations which would seem to point to the\r\npresence of structures akin to sponges or possibly remains of seaweeds.\r\nThese observations Gümbel has extended into other localities in Bavaria\r\nand Bohemia, and also in Silesia and Sweden, establishing the existence\r\nof Eozoon fossils in all the Laurentian limestones of the middle and\r\nnorth of Europe.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 55.--_Archæospherinæ from Pargas in Finland._\r\n(After Gümbel.)\r\n\r\n(Magnified.)]\r\n\r\nGümbel has further found in beds overlying the older Eozoic series,\r\nand probably of the same age with the Canadian Huronian, a different\r\nspecies of Eozoon, with smaller and more contracted chambers, and\r\nstill finer and more crowded canals. This, which is to be regarded as\r\na distinct species, or at least a well-marked varietal form, he has\r\nnamed _Eozoon Bavaricum_ (Fig. 56). Thus this early introduction of\r\nlife is not peculiar to that old continent which we sometimes call the\r\nNew World, but applies to Europe as well, and Europe has furnished a\r\nsuccessor to Eozoon in the later Eozoic or Huronian period.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 56.--_Section of Eozoon Bavaricum, with Serpentine,\r\nfrom the Crystalline Limestone of the Hercynian primitive Clay-slate\r\nFormation at Hohenberg; 25 diameters (probably Huronian)._\r\n\r\n(_a_) Sparry carbonate of lime, (_b_) Cellular carbonate of lime, (_c_)\r\nSystem of tubuli. (_d_) Serpentine replacing the coarser ordinary\r\nvariety, (_e_) Serpentine and hornblende replacing the finer variety,\r\nin the very much contorted portions.]\r\n\r\nIn rocks of this age in America, after long search and much slicing of\r\nlimestones, I have hitherto failed to find any decided foraminiferal\r\nremains other than the Tudor and Madoc specimens, which may be of this\r\nage. They are laminated forms resembling Eozoon, but I have reason to\r\nbelieve that their minute structure more closely resembles that of\r\nCryptozoon, though it is somewhat obscure. If these are really Huronian\r\nand not Laurentian, the Eozoon from this horizon does not sensibly\r\ndiffer from that of the Lower Laurentian.\r\n\r\nWe are indebted to Mr. Matthew, of St. John, New Brunswick, who has so\r\ngreatly distinguished himself by his discoveries in the Cambrian of\r\nthat region, for some remarkable additions to the contemporaries of\r\nEozoon. One of these is a laminated body, like Eozoon in its general\r\nappearance, but growing in crowded masses which by mutual pressure\r\nbecome columnar (Fig. 57). In the best preserved specimens each layer\r\nseems to consist of a thin lamina separated from its neighbours by\r\na finely granular mass, traversed by innumerable irregular tubes.\r\nThis recalls the structure of Cryptozoon of Hall, which, as we have\r\nseen, is found in pre-Cambrian rocks in Colorado, and abounds in the\r\nUpper Cambrian in New York, in Minnesota, and in different parts of\r\nCanada, but Archæozoon differs in its form and habit of growth. If\r\nthe Stromatoporæ of the Ordovician and Silurian are hydroids, this\r\nmay also be the case with Cryptozoon; but so far as its own structure\r\nis concerned, it approaches most nearly to the fossils known as\r\nLoftusia in the Carboniferous and later formations, and these are\r\ngenerally regarded as Foraminiferal. We may thus have another giant\r\nForaminiferal organism which contributed to the building up of rocks in\r\nthe Laurentian seas.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 57.--_Archæozoon Acadiense_, Matthew. _Diagrammatic\r\ntransverse and longitudinal sections of a small specimen._\r\n\r\nSpecimen in Peter Redpath Museum.]\r\n\r\n_Pre-Palæozoic Rocks of Southern New Brunswick, as tabulated by\r\nMatthew:--\"_\r\n\r\n  +--+--+------------------------------------------------------------+\r\n  |  |  |                                                Thickness   |\r\n  |  |  |                                                   Feet.    |\r\n  |  |  | Coastal series (or system), 1872.--                        |\r\n  |  |  |   Grits, hydromicaschists, agillities, etc.                |\r\n  |  |  |   resembling the Pebidian rocks of Dr. H.                  |\r\n  |  |  |   Hicks                                          10,000    |\r\n  |  |  |                                                            |\r\n  |  |E | Coldbrook Series (or System), 1865.--                      |\r\n  |  |O |   Diorites, felsites, petrosilex, etc.;                    |\r\n  |  |Z |   resembling the Arvonian rocks of Dr.                     |\r\n  |  |O |   Hicks.

Matthew has\r\nalso described forms which he regards as spicules of sponges from\r\nthe Laurentian of New Brunswick.[42] One of these seems to present\r\ncruciform needles forming square areas, like the Protospongia of\r\nSalter, from the Cambrian.

I do not propose here to treat of the objections in\r\ndetail. I have presented the case of Eozoon on its own merits, and on\r\nthese it must stand. I may merely state that the objectors strive to\r\naccount for the existence of Eozoon by purely mineral deposition, and\r\nthat the complicated changes which they require to suppose are perhaps\r\nthe strongest indirect evidence for the necessity of regarding the\r\nstructures as organic. The reader who desires to appreciate this may\r\nconsult my memoir of 1888.[44]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 44: Also Rowney and King's papers in _Journal Geological\r\nSociety_, August, 1866; and _Proceedings Irish Academy_, 1870 and\r\n1871.]\r\n\r\nI confess that I feel disposed to treat very tenderly the position\r\nof objectors. The facts I have stated make large demands on the\r\nfaith of the greater part even of naturalists. Very few geologists\r\nor naturalists have much knowledge of the structure of foraminiferal\r\nshells, or would be able under the microscope to recognise them with\r\ncertainty. Nor have they any distinct ideas of the appearances of such\r\nstructures under different kinds of preservation and mineralization.\r\nFurther, they have long been accustomed to regard the so-called Azoic\r\nor Archæan rocks as not only destitute of organic remains, but as\r\nbeing in such a state of metamorphism that these could not have been\r\npreserved had they existed. Few, therefore, are able intelligently\r\nto decide for themselves, and so they are called on to trust to the\r\ninvestigations of others, and on their testimony to modify in a marked\r\ndegree their previous beliefs as to the duration of life on our planet.\r\nIn these circumstances it is rather wonderful that the researches made\r\nwith reference to Eozoon have met with so general acceptance, and\r\nthat the resurrection of this ancient inhabitant of the earth has not\r\naroused more of the sceptical tendency of our age.\r\n\r\nIt must not be lost sight of, however, that in such cases there may\r\nexist a large amount of undeveloped and even unconscious scepticism,\r\nwhich shows itself not in active opposition, but merely in quietly\r\nignoring this great discovery, or regarding it with doubt, as an\r\nuncertain or unestablished point in science. Such scepticism is\r\nespecially to be expected on the part of the many enthusiastic students\r\nof petrography who are accustomed to regard rocks merely as mineral\r\naggregates, and even to have their slices prepared in a manner which\r\nscarcely permits organic remains of present to be distinguished.\r\nSuch students should consider that the discovery of Eozoon brings\r\nthe rocks of the Laurentian system into more full harmony with the\r\nother geological formations. It explains the origin of the Laurentian\r\nlimestones in consistency with that of similar rocks in the later\r\nperiods, and in like manner it helps us to account for the graphite\r\nand sulphides and iron ores of these old rocks. It shows us that no\r\ntime was lost in the introduction of life on the earth. Otherwise there\r\nwould have been a vast lapse of time in which, while the conditions\r\nsuitable to life were probably present, no living thing existed to\r\ntake advantage of these conditions. Further, it gives a more simple\r\nbeginning of life than that afforded by the more complex fauna of the\r\nCambrian age; and this is more in accordance with what we know of the\r\nslow and gradual introduction of new forms of living things during the\r\nvast periods of Palæozoic time. In connection with this, it opens a\r\nnew and promising field of observation in the older rocks; and if this\r\nshould prove fertile, its exploration may afford a vast harvest of new\r\nforms to the geologists of the present and coming time. This result\r\nwill be in entire accordance with what has taken place before in the\r\nhistory of geological discovery. I can myself remember a time when the\r\nold and semi-metamorphic sediments constituting the great Cambrian\r\nsystem were massed together in geological classifications as primitive\r\nor primary rocks, destitute or nearly destitute of organic remains.\r\nThe brilliant discoveries of Sedgwick, Murchison, Barrande, and a\r\nhost of others, have peopled these once barren regions; and they now\r\nstretch before our wondering gaze in the long vistas of early Palæozoic\r\nlife. So we now look out from the Cambrian shore upon the ocean of the\r\nEtcheminian, the Huronian, and the Laurentian--all to us yet almost\r\ntenantless, except for the few organisms which, like stray shells cast\r\nupon the beach, or a far-off land dimly seen in the distance, incite\r\nto further researches, and to the exploration of the unknown treasures\r\nthat still lie undiscovered. It would be a suitable culmination of\r\nthe geological work of the last half-century, and one within reach at\r\nleast of our immediate successors, to fill up this great blank, and to\r\ntrace back the Primordial life to the stage of Eozoon, and perhaps even\r\nbeyond this, to predecessors which may have existed at the beginning\r\nof the Laurentian, when the earliest sediments of that great formation\r\nwere laid down. Vast unexplored areas of Laurentian and Huronian rocks\r\nexist in the Old World and the New. The most ample facilities for\r\nmicroscopic examination of rocks may now be obtained; and I could wish\r\nthat one result of the publication of these pages may be to direct the\r\nattention of some of the younger and more active geologists to these\r\nfields of investigation. It is to be observed also that such regions\r\nare among the richest in useful minerals, and there is no reason why\r\nsearch for these fossils should not be connected with other and more\r\npractically useful researches. On this subject it will not be out of\r\nplace to quote the remarks which I made in one of my earlier papers on\r\nthe Laurentian fossils:--\r\n\r\n\"This subject opens up several interesting fields of chemical,\r\nbiological, and geological inquiry. One of these relates to the\r\nconclusions stated by Dr. Hunt as to the probable existence of a\r\nlarge amount of carbonic acid in the Laurentian atmosphere, and of\r\nmuch carbonate of lime in the seas of that period, and the possible\r\nrelation of this to the abundance of certain low forms of plants and\r\nanimals. Another is the comparison already instituted by Professor\r\nHuxley and Dr. Carpenter, between the conditions of the Laurentian and\r\nthose of the deeper parts of the modern ocean. Another is the possible\r\noccurrence of other forms of animal life than Protozoa, which I have\r\nstated in my paper of 1864, after extensive microscopic study of the\r\nLaurentian limestones, to be indicated by the occurrence of calcareous\r\nfragments, differing in structure from Eozoon, but at present of\r\nunknown nature. Another is the effort to bridge over, by further\r\ndiscoveries [similar to those of Cryptozoon and Archæozoon], the gap\r\nnow existing between the life of the Lower Laurentian and that of the\r\nCambrian period. It is scarcely too much to say that these inquiries\r\nopen up a new world of thought and investigation, and hold out the\r\nhope of bringing us into the presence of the actual origin of organic\r\nlife on our planet, though this may perhaps be found to have been\r\npre-Laurentian. I would here take the opportunity of repeating that,\r\nin proposing the name Eozoon for the first fossil of the Laurentian,\r\nand in suggesting for the period the name 'Eozoic,' I have by no means\r\ndesired to exclude the possibility of forms of life which may have been\r\nprecursors of what is now to us the dawn of organic existence. Should\r\nremains of still older organisms be found in those rocks now known to\r\nus only by pebbles in the Laurentian, these names will at least serve\r\nto mark an important stage in geological investigation.\"\r\n\r\nBut what if the result of such investigations should be to produce more\r\nsceptics, or to bring to light mineral structures so resembling Eozoon\r\nas to throw doubt upon the whole of the results detailed in these\r\nchapters? I can fancy that this might be the first consequence, more\r\nespecially if the investigations were those of persons more conversant\r\nwith rocks and minerals than with fossils; but I see no reason to\r\nfear the ultimate results. In any case, no doubt, the value of the\r\nresearches hitherto made may be diminished. It is always the fate of\r\ndiscoverers in Natural Science, either to be followed by opponents who\r\ntemporarily or permanently impugn or destroy the value of their new\r\nfacts, or by other investigators who push on the knowledge of facts and\r\nprinciples so far beyond their standpoint that the original discoveries\r\nare cast into the shade. This is a fatality incident to the progress of\r\nscientific work, from which no man can be free; and in so far as such\r\nmatters are concerned, we must all be content to share the fate of the\r\nold fossils whose history we investigate, and, having served our day\r\nand generation, to give place to others. If any part of our work should\r\nstand the fire of discussion, let us be thankful. One thing at least\r\nis certain, that such careful surveys as those in the Laurentian rocks\r\nof Canada which led to the discovery of Eozoon, and such microscopic\r\nexaminations as those by which it has been worked up and presented to\r\nthe public, cannot fail to yield good results of one kind or another.\r\nAlready the attention excited by the controversies about Eozoon,\r\nby attracting investigators to the study of various microscopic and\r\nimitative forms in rocks, has promoted the advancement of knowledge,\r\nand must do so still more. For my own part, though I am not content to\r\nbase all my reputation on such work as I have done with respect to this\r\nold fossil--which, indeed, was merely an interlude into which I was led\r\nby the urgency of my friend Logan--I am willing at least to take the\r\nresponsibility of the results I have announced, whatever conclusions\r\nmay be finally reached; and in the consciousness of an honest effort\r\nto extend the knowledge of nature, to look forward to a better fame\r\nthan any that could result from the most successful and permanent\r\nvindication of every detail of our scientific discoveries, even if they\r\ncould be pushed to a point which no subsequent investigation in the\r\nsame difficult line of research would be able to overpass.\r\n\r\nContenting myself with these general remarks, I shall close this\r\nchapter with a short summary of the reasons which may be adduced\r\nin support of the animal nature of Eozoon, prefaced by an ideal\r\nrestoration of it in the supposition that it was a rhizopod (Fig. 58).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 58.--_Restoration of Eozoon as a generalized\r\nForaminiferal Organism (enlarged)._\r\n\r\nShowing endosarc, exosarc, and pseudopods, and the calcareous skeleton\r\nwith its canals.]\r\n\r\nIn doing so, I shall merely sum up the evidence as it has been\r\npresented by Sir W. E. Logan, Dr. Carpenter, Dr. Hunt, and the author,\r\nin a short and intelligible form; and I shall do so under a few brief\r\nheads, with some explanatory remarks:--\r\n\r\n1. The Upper Laurentian of Canada, a rock formation whose distribution,\r\nage, and structure have been carefully worked out in several extensive\r\ndistricts by the Canadian Survey, is found to contain thick and widely\r\ndistributed beds of limestone, related to the other beds in the same\r\nway in which limestones occur in the sediments of other geological\r\nformations. There also occur in the same formation, graphite, iron\r\nores, and metallic sulphides, in such relations as to suggest the idea\r\nthat the limestones as well as these other minerals are of organic\r\norigin.\r\n\r\n2. In the limestones are found laminated bodies of definite form and\r\nstructure, composed of calcite alternating with serpentine and other\r\nminerals. The forms of these bodies suggested a resemblance to the\r\nSilurian Stromatoporæ, and the different mineral substances associated\r\nwith the calcite in the production of similar forms showed that these\r\nwere not accidental or concretionary.\r\n\r\n3. On microscopic examination, it proved that the calcareous laminæ\r\nof these forms were similar in structure to the shells of modern\r\nand fossil Foraminifera, more especially those of the Rotaline and\r\nNummuline types, and that the finer structures, though usually filled\r\nwith serpentine and other hydrous silicates, were sometimes occupied\r\nwith calcite, pyroxene, or dolomite, showing that they must when recent\r\nhave been empty canals and tubes.\r\n\r\n4. The mode of filling thus suggested for the chambers and tubes of\r\nEozoon is precisely that which takes place in modern Foraminifera\r\nfilled with glauconite, and in Palæozoic crinoids and corals filled\r\nwith other hydrous silicates, all more or less chemically allied to\r\nserpentine.\r\n\r\n5. The type of growth and structure predicated of Eozoon from the\r\nobserved appearances, in its great size, its laminated and acervuline\r\nforms, and in its canal system and tubulation, are not only in\r\nconformity with those of other Foraminifera, but such as might be\r\nexpected in a very ancient form of that group.\r\n\r\n6. Indications exist of other organic bodies in the limestones\r\ncontaining Eozoon, and also of the Eozoon being preserved not only in\r\nreefs but in drifted fragmental beds as in the case of modern corals.\r\n\r\n7. Similar organic structures have been found in the Laurentian\r\nlimestones of Massachusetts, New York, Brazil,[45] and also in those\r\nof various parts of Europe, and Dr. Gümbel has found an additional\r\nspecies in rocks succeeding the Laurentian.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 45: Fragmental; specimens from J. A. Derby, Esq.]\r\n\r\n8. The manner in which the structures of Eozoon are effected by the\r\nfaulting, development of crystals, mineral veins, and other effects of\r\ndisturbance and metamorphism in the containing rocks, is precisely that\r\nwhich might be expected on the supposition that it is of organic origin.\r\n\r\n9. The exertions of several active and able opponents have failed to\r\nshow how, otherwise than by organic agency, such structures as those\r\nof Eozoon can be formed, except on the supposition of pseudo-morphism\r\nand replacement, which must be regarded as chemically extravagant,\r\nand which would equally impugn the validity of all fossils determined\r\nby microscopic structure. In like manner all comparisons of these\r\nstructures with dendritic and other imitative forms have signally\r\nfailed, in the opinion of those best qualified to judge.\r\n\r\nAnother and perhaps simpler way of putting the case is the\r\nfollowing:--Only four general modes of accounting for the existence\r\nof Eozoon have been proposed. The first is that of Professors King\r\nand Rowney, who regard the chambers and canals filled with serpentine\r\nas arising from the erosion or partial dissolving away of serpentine\r\nand its replacement by calcite. The objections to this are conclusive.\r\nIt does not explain the fine tubulation, which has to be separately\r\naccounted for by confounding it, contrary to the observed facts,\r\nwith the veins of fibrous serpentine which actually pass through\r\ncracks in the fossil. Such replacement is in the highest degree\r\nunlikely on chemical grounds, and there is no evidence of it in the\r\nnumerous serpentine grains, nodules, and bands in the Laurentian\r\nlimestones. On the other hand, the opposite replacement, that of\r\nlimestone by serpentine, seems to have occurred. The mechanical\r\ndifficulties in accounting for the delicate canals on this theory are\r\nalso insurmountable. Finally, it does not account for the specimens\r\npreserved in pyroxene and other silicates, and in dolomite and calcite.\r\nA second mode of accounting for the facts is that the Eozoon forms are\r\nmerely peculiar concretions. But this fails to account for their great\r\ndifference from the other serpentine concretions in the same beds, and\r\nfor their regularity of plan and the delicacy of their structure, and\r\nalso for minerals of different kinds entering into their composition,\r\nand still presenting precisely the same forms and structures. The third\r\nis that first suggested, I think, by Jullien, and later by Gregory and\r\nLavis, that the forms are merely banded alternations of calcite with\r\nsilicious minerals similar to those observed at the junction of igneous\r\nrocks and limestones. To this it may be replied that there is really\r\nonly an apparent resemblance, which, on careful examination, proves\r\nto be illusory; that it does not account for the canals and tubuli,\r\nand that studies of such banded rocks from several regions have been\r\nmade by competent observers, who have distinguished these from the\r\nLaurentian Eozoon. The only remaining theory is that of the filling\r\nof cavities by infiltration with serpentine. This accords with the\r\nfact that such infiltration by minerals akin to serpentine exists in\r\nfossils in later rocks. It also accords with the known aqueous origin\r\nof the serpentine nodules and bands, the veins of fibrous serpentine,\r\nand the other minerals found filling the cavities of Eozoon. Even the\r\npyroxene has been shown by Hunt to exist in the Laurentian in veins\r\nof aqueous origin. The only difficulty existing on this view is how\r\na calcite skeleton with such chambers, canals, and tubuli could be\r\nformed; and this is solved by the discovery that all these facts\r\ncorrespond precisely with those to be found in the shells of modern\r\noceanic Foraminifera. The existence, then, of Eozoon, its structure,\r\nand its relations to the containing rocks and minerals being admitted,\r\nno rational explanation of its origin seems at present possible other\r\nthan that advocated in the preceding pages.\r\n\r\nIf the reader will now turn to the figures in the illustration on the\r\nopposite page (Fig. 59), he will find a selection of examples bearing\r\non the above arguments and objections. Fig. 1 represents a portion of a\r\nvery thin slice of a specimen traversed by veins of fibrous serpentine\r\nor chrysotile, and having the calcite of the walls more broken by\r\ncleavage planes than usual. The portion selected shows a part of one\r\nof the chambers filled with serpentine, which presents the usual\r\ncurdled aspect almost impossible to represent in a drawing (_s_). It\r\nis traversed by a branching vein of chrysotile (_s′_), which, where\r\ncut precisely parallel to its fibres, shows clear fine cross lines,\r\nindicating the sides of its constituent prisms, and where the plane of\r\nsection has passed obliquely to its fibres, has a curiously stippled or\r\nfrowsy appearance.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 59.--_Figures of various Structures and States of\r\nPreservation._\r\n\r\n  Fig. 1.--Portion of two laminæ and intervening serpentine, with\r\n     chrysotile vein.

Nothing can be more\r\ndistinct than the appearances presented by this wall and a chrysotile\r\nvein, under every variety of magnifying power and illumination; and all\r\nwho have had an opportunity of examining my specimens have expressed\r\nastonishment that appearances so dissimilar should have been confounded\r\nwith each other. On the lower side two indentations are seen in the\r\nproper wall (_c_). These are connected with the openings into small\r\nsubordinate chamberlets, one of which is in part included in the\r\nthickness of the slice. At the upper and lower parts of the figure\r\nare seen portions of the intermediate skeleton traversed by canals,\r\nwhich in the lower part are very large, though from the analogy of\r\nother specimens it is probable that they have in their interstices,\r\nand at their branching extremities, minute canaliculi not visible in\r\nthis slice. Fig. 2, from the same specimen, shows the termination of\r\none of the canals against the proper wall, its end expanding into a\r\nwide disc of sarcode on the surface of the wall, as may be seen in\r\nsimilar structures in modern Foraminifera. In this specimen the canals\r\nare beautifully smooth and cylindrical, but they sometimes present a\r\nknotted or jointed appearance, especially in specimens decalcified\r\nby acids, in which perhaps some erosion has taken place. They are\r\nalso occasionally fringed with minute crystals, especially in those\r\nspecimens in which the calcite has been partially replaced with other\r\nminerals. Fig. 3 shows an example of faulting of the proper wall, an\r\nappearance not infrequently observed; and it also shows a vein of\r\nchrysotile crossing the line of fault, and not itself affected by it--a\r\nclear evidence of its posterior origin. Figs. 4 and 5 are examples of\r\nspecimens having the canals filled with dolomite, and showing extremely\r\nfine canals in the interstices of the others: an appearance observed\r\nonly in the thicker parts of the skeleton, and when these are very well\r\npreserved. These dolomitized portions require some precautions for\r\ntheir observation, either in slices or decalcified specimens, but when\r\nproperly managed they show the structures in very great perfection. The\r\nspecimen in Fig. 5 is from an abnormally thick portion of intermediate\r\nskeleton, having unusually thick canals, and referred to in a previous\r\nchapter. Such additional peculiarities and specialties might be\r\nmultiplied to any extent from the numerous prepared specimens now in\r\nour collections.\r\n\r\nOne object which I have in view in thus minutely directing attention\r\nto these illustrations, is to show the nature of the misapprehensions\r\nwhich may occur in examining specimens of this kind, and at the same\r\ntime the certainty which may be attained when proper precautions are\r\ntaken. I may add that such structures as those referred to are best\r\nseen in extremely thin slices, and that the observer must not expect\r\nthat every specimen will exhibit them equally well. It is only by\r\npreparing and examining many specimens that the best results can be\r\nobtained. It often happens that one specimen is required to show well\r\none part of the structures, and a different one to show another; and\r\nprevious to actual trial, it is not easy to say which portion of the\r\nstructures any particular fragment will show most clearly. This renders\r\nit somewhat difficult to supply one's friends with specimens. Really\r\ngood slices can be prepared only from the best material and by skilled\r\nmanipulators; imperfect slices may only mislead; and rough specimens\r\nmay not be properly prepared by persons unaccustomed to the work, or\r\nif so prepared, may not turn out satisfactory, or may not be skilfully\r\nexamined. One slice heated in the grinding may show nothing but\r\ncleavage in the calcite layers, while an adjoining one more carefully\r\nprepared may show beautiful canals. These difficulties, however, Eozoon\r\nshares with other specimens in micro-geology, and I have experienced\r\nsimilar disappointments in the case of fossil wood.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion of this part of the subject, and referring to the notes\r\nappended to this work for some further details, I would express the\r\nhope that those who have hitherto opposed the interpretation of Eozoon\r\nas organic, and to whose ability and honesty of purpose I willingly\r\nbear testimony, will find themselves enabled to acknowledge at least\r\nthe reasonable probability of that interpretation of these remarkable\r\nforms and structures.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                         _THE ORIGIN OF LIFE_\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   X\r\n\r\n                         _THE ORIGIN OF LIFE_\r\n\r\n\r\nThe thoughts suggested to the philosophical naturalist by the\r\ncontemplation of the dawn of life on our planet are necessarily many\r\nand exciting, and the subject has in it the materials for enabling the\r\ngeneral reader better to judge of some of the theories of the origin of\r\nlife agitated in our time. Let us then put Eozoon into the witness-box,\r\nand try to elicit its testimony as to the beginnings of life; supposing\r\nfor the moment that it is really an animal, and not a mere pretender;\r\nthough even in that case, it might serve to represent the first animal,\r\nwhatever it may have been.\r\n\r\nLooking down from the elevation of our physiological and mental\r\nsuperiority, it is difficult to realize the exact conditions in which\r\nlife exists in creatures so simple as the Protozoa. There may perhaps\r\nbe higher intelligences that find it equally difficult to realize how\r\nlife and reason can manifest themselves in such poor houses of clay\r\nas those we inhabit. But placing ourselves near to these creatures,\r\nand entering as it were into sympathy with them, we can understand\r\nsomething of their powers and feelings. In the first place, it is\r\nplain that they can vigorously, if roughly, exercise those mechanical,\r\nchemical, and vegetative powers of life which are characteristic of\r\nthe animal. They can seize, swallow, digest, and assimilate food; and,\r\nemploying its albuminous parts in nourishing their tissues, can burn\r\naway the rest in processes akin to our respiration, or reject it from\r\ntheir system. Like us, they can subsist only on food which the plant\r\nhas previously produced; for in this world, from the beginning of time,\r\nthe plant has been the only organism which could use the solar light\r\nand heat as forces to enable it to turn the dead elements of matter\r\ninto living, growing tissues, and into organic compounds capable of\r\nnourishing the animal. Like us, the Protozoa expend the food which\r\nthey have assimilated in the production of animal force, and in doing\r\nso cause it to be oxidized, or burnt away, and resolved again into\r\ndead matter. It is true that we have much more complicated apparatus\r\nfor performing these functions, but it does not follow that this gives\r\nus much real superiority, except relatively to the more difficult\r\nconditions of our existence. The gourmand who enjoys his dinner may\r\nhave no more pleasure in the act than the Amœba which swallows a\r\nDiatom; and for all that the man knows of the subsequent processes to\r\nwhich the food is subjected, his interior might be a mass of jelly,\r\nwith extemporised vacuoles, like that of his humble fellow-animal. The\r\nworkman or the athlete has bones and muscles of vastly complicated\r\nstructure, but to him the muscular act is as simple and unconscious a\r\nprocess as the sending out of a pseudopod to a Protozoon. The clay is\r\nafter all the same, and there may be as much credit to the artist in\r\nmaking a simple organism with varied powers, as a more complex frame\r\nfor doing nicer work. It is a weakness of humanity to plume itself on\r\nadvantages not of its own making, and to treat its superior gifts as\r\nif they were the result of its own endeavours. The truculent traveller\r\nwho illustrated his boast of superiority over the Indian by comparing\r\nhis rifle with the bow and arrows of the savage, was well answered by\r\nthe question, \"Can you make a rifle?\" and when he had to answer, \"No,\"\r\nby the rejoinder, \"Then I am at least better than you, for I can make\r\nmy bow and arrows.\" The Amœba or the Eozoon is probably no more than\r\nwe its own creator; but if it could produce itself out of vegetable\r\nmatter, or out of inorganic substances, it might claim in so far a\r\nhigher place in the scale of being than we; and as it is, it can assert\r\nequal powers of digestion, assimilation, and motion, with much less of\r\nbodily mechanism.\r\n\r\nIn order that we may feel, a complicated apparatus of nerves and\r\nbrain-cells has to be constructed and set to work; but the Protozoon,\r\nwithout any distinct brain, is all brain, and its sensation is simply\r\ndirect. Thus vision in these creatures is probably performed in a rough\r\nway by any part of their transparent bodies, and taste and smell are\r\nno doubt in the same case. Whether they have any perception of sound\r\nas distinct from the mere vibrations ascertained by touch, we do not\r\nknow. Here also we are not far removed above the Protozoa, especially\r\nthose of us to whom touch, seeing, and hearing are mere feelings,\r\nwithout thought or knowledge of the apparatus employed. We might so far\r\nas well be Amœbas. As we rise higher we meet with more differences.\r\nYet it is evident that our gelatinous fellow-being can feel pain,\r\ndread danger, desire possessions, enjoy pleasure, and in a simple,\r\nunconscious way entertain many of the appetites and passions that\r\naffect ourselves. The wonder is that with so little of organization it\r\ncan do so much. Yet, perhaps, life can manifest itself in a broader\r\nand more intense way where there is little organization; and a highly\r\nstrung and complex organism is not so much a necessary condition of\r\na higher life as a mere means of better adapting it to its present\r\nsurroundings. Those philosophies which identify the thinking mind with\r\nthe material organism, must seem outrageous blunders to an Amœba on\r\nthe one hand, or to an angel on the other, could either be enabled to\r\nunderstand them; which, however, is not very probable, as they are too\r\nintimately bound up with the mere prejudices incident to the present\r\ncondition of our humanity. In any case, the Protozoa teach us how much\r\nof animal function may be fulfilled by a very simple organism, and warn\r\nus against the fallacy that creatures of this simple structure are\r\nnecessarily nearer to inorganic matter, and more easily developed from\r\nit than beings of more complex mould.\r\n\r\nA similar lesson is taught by the complexity of their skeletons. We\r\nspeak in a crude, unscientific way of these animals accumulating\r\ncalcareous matter, and building up reefs of limestone. We must,\r\nhowever, bear in mind that they are as dependent on their food for\r\nthe materials of their skeletons as we are, and that their crusts\r\ngrow in the interior of the sarcode just as our bones do within our\r\nbodies. The provision even for nourishing the interior of the skeleton\r\nby tubuli and canals is in principle similar to that involved in the\r\nHaversian canals, cells, and canalicules of bone. The Protozoon of\r\ncourse knows neither more nor less of this than the average Englishman.\r\nIt is altogether a matter of unconscious growth. The process in\r\nthe Protozoa strikes some minds, however, as the more wonderful of\r\nthe two. It is, says an eminent modern physiologist, a matter of\r\n\"profound significance\" that this \"particle of jelly [the sarcode\r\nof a Foramlnifer] is capable of guiding physical forces in such a\r\nmanner as to give rise to these exquisite and almost mathematically\r\narranged structures.\" Respecting the structures themselves, there is\r\nno exaggeration in this. No arch or dome framed by human skill is more\r\nperfect in beauty or in the realization of mechanical ideas than the\r\ntests of some Foraminifera, and none is so complete and wonderful in\r\nits internal structure. The particle of jelly, however, is a figure of\r\nspeech. The body of the humblest Foramlnifer is much more than this.\r\nIt is an organism with divers parts, as we have already seen in a\r\nprevious chapter, and It is endowed with the mysterious forces of life\r\nwhich in it guide the physical forces, just as they do in building\r\nup phosphate of lime in our bones, or indeed just as the will of the\r\narchitect does in building a palace. The profound significance which\r\nthis has, reaches beyond the domain of the physical and vital, even to\r\nthe spiritual. It clings to all our conceptions of living things: quite\r\nas much, for example, to the evolution of an animal, with all its parts\r\nfrom a one-celled germ, or to the connection of brain-cells with the\r\nmanifestations of intelligence. Viewed in this way, we may share with\r\nthe author of the sentence I have quoted his feeling of veneration in\r\nthe presence of this great wonder of animal life, \"burning, and not\r\nconsumed,\" nay, building up, and that in many and beautiful forms. We\r\nmay realize it most of all in the presence of the organism which was\r\nperhaps the first to manifest on our planet these marvellous powers.\r\nWe must, however, here, also, beware of that credulity which makes too\r\nmany thinkers limit their conceptions altogether to physical force\r\nin matters of this kind. The merely materialistic physiologist is\r\nreally in no better position than the savage who quails before the\r\nthunderstorm, or rejoices in the solar warmth, and seeing no force or\r\npower beyond, fancies himself in the immediate presence of his God. In\r\nEozoon we must discern not only a mass of jelly, but a being endowed\r\nwith that higher vital force which surpasses vegetable life and also\r\nphysical and chemical forces; and in this animal energy we must see an\r\nemanation from a Will higher than our own, ruling vitality itself; and\r\nthis not merely to the end of constructing the skeleton of a Protozoon,\r\nbut of elaborating all the wonderful developments of life that were to\r\nfollow in succeeding ages, and with reference to which the production\r\nand growth of this creature were initial steps. It is this mystery of\r\ndesign which really constitutes the \"profound significance\" of the\r\nforaminiferal skeleton.\r\n\r\nAnother phenomenon of animality forced upon our notice by the Protozoa\r\nis that of the conditions of life in animals not individual, as we\r\nare, but aggregative and accumulative in indefinite masses. What, for\r\ninstance, the relations to each other of the Polyps, growing together\r\nin a coral mass, of the separate parts of a Sponge, or the separate\r\ncells of a Foraminifer, or of the sarcode mass of an indefinitely\r\nspread out Cryptozoon. In the case of the Polyps, we may believe that\r\nthere is special sensation in the tentacles and oral opening of each\r\nindividual, and that each may experience hunger when in want, or\r\nsatisfaction when it is filled with food, and that injuries to one part\r\nof the mass may indirectly affect other parts, but that the nutrition\r\nof the whole mass may be as much unfelt by the individual Polyps as\r\nthe processes going on in our own bones are by us. So in the case of\r\na large Sponge or Foraminifer, there may be some special sensation in\r\nindividual cells, pseudopods, or segments, and the general sensation\r\nmay be very limited, while unconscious living powers pervade the whole.\r\nIn this matter of aggregation of animals we have thus various grades.\r\nThe Foraminifers and Sponges present us with the simplest of all, and\r\nthat which most resembles the aggregation of buds in the plant. The\r\nPolyps and complex Bryozoons present a higher and more specialized\r\ntype; and though the bilateral symmetry which obtains in the higher\r\nanimals is of a different nature, it still at least reminds us of that\r\nmultiplication of similar parts which we see in the lower grades of\r\nbeing. It is worthy of notice here that the lower animals which show\r\naggregative tendencies present but imperfect indications, or none\r\nat all, of bilateral symmetry. Their bodies, like those of plants,\r\nare for the most part built up around a central axis, or they show\r\ntendencies to spiral modes of growth.\r\n\r\nIt is this composite sort of life which is connected with the main\r\ngeological function of the Foraminifer. While active sensation,\r\nappetite, and enjoyment pervade the pseudopods and external sarcode\r\nof the mass, the hard skeleton common to the whole is growing within;\r\nand in this way the calcareous matter is gradually removed from\r\nthe sea-water, and built up in solid reefs, or in piles of loose\r\nforaminiferal shells. Thus it is the aggregative or common life,\r\nalike in Foraminifers as in Corals, that tends most powerfully to the\r\naccumulation of calcareous matter; and those creatures whose life is\r\nof this complex character are best suited to be world-builders, since\r\nthe result of their growth is not merely a cemetery of their osseous\r\nremains, but a huge communistic edifice, to which multitudes of lives\r\nhave contributed, and in which successive generations take up their\r\nabode on the remains of their ancestors. This process, so potent in the\r\nprogress of the earth's geological history, began, as far as we know,\r\nwith Eozoon.\r\n\r\nWhether, then, in questioning our proto-foraminifer, we have reference\r\nto the vital functions of its gelatinous sarcode, to the complexity and\r\nbeauty of its calcareous test, or to its capacity for effecting great\r\nmaterial results through the union of individuals, we perceive that we\r\nhave to do, not with a low condition of those powers which we designate\r\nlife, but with the manifestation of those powers through the means of a\r\nsimple organism; and this in a degree of perfection which we, from our\r\npoint of view, would have in the first instance supposed impossible.\r\n\r\nIf we imagine a world altogether destitute of life, we still might\r\nhave geological formations in progress. Not only would volcanoes belch\r\nforth their liquid lavas and their stones and ashes, but the waves and\r\ncurrents of the ocean and the rains and streams on the land, with the\r\nceaseless decomposing action of the carbonic acid of the atmosphere,\r\nwould be piling up mud, sand, and pebbles in the sea. There might even\r\nbe some formation of limestone taking place where springs charged\r\nwith bicarbonate of lime were oozing out on the land or the bottom of\r\nthe waters. But in such a world all the carbon would be in the state\r\nof carbonic acid, and all the limestone would either be diffused in\r\nsmall quantities through various rocks or in limited local beds, or\r\nin solution, perhaps as chloride of calcium, in the sea. Dr. Hunt has\r\ngiven chemical grounds for supposing that the most ancient seas were\r\nlargely supplied with this very soluble salt, instead of the chloride\r\nof sodium, or common salt, which now prevails in the sea-water.\r\n\r\nWhere in such a world would life be introduced? on the land or in the\r\nwaters? All scientific probability would say in the latter. The ocean\r\nis now vastly more populous than the land. The waters alone afford\r\nthe conditions necessary at once for the most minute and the grandest\r\norganisms, at once for the simplest and for others of the most complex\r\ncharacter. Especially do they afford the best conditions for those\r\nanimals which subsist in complex communities, and which aggregate large\r\nquantities of mineral matter in their skeletons. So true is this that\r\nup to the present time all the species of Protozoa and of the animals\r\nmost nearly allied to them are aquatic. Even in the waters, however,\r\nplant life, though possibly in very simple forms, must precede the\r\nanimal.\r\n\r\nLet humble plants, then, be introduced in the waters, and they would\r\nat once begin to use the solar light for the purpose of decomposing\r\ncarbonic acid, and forming carbon compounds which had not before\r\nexisted, and which independently of vegetable life would never have\r\nexisted. At the same time lime and other mineral substances present in\r\nthe sea-water would be fixed in the tissues of these plants, either\r\nin a minute state of division, as little grains or Coccoliths, or in\r\nmore solid masses like those of the Corallines and Nullipores. In this\r\nway a beginning of limestone formation might be made, and quantities\r\nof carbonaceous and bituminous matter, resulting from the decay of\r\nmarine plants, might accumulate in the sea-bottom. The plants have\r\ncollected stores of organic matter, and their minute germs, along\r\nwith microscopic species, are floating everywhere in the sea. Nay,\r\nthere may be abundant examples of those Amœba-like germs of aquatic\r\nplants, simulating for a time the life of the animal, and then\r\nreturning into the circle of vegetable life. In these some might see\r\nprecursors of the Protozoa, though they are probably rather prophetic\r\nanalogues than blood relations. The plant has fulfilled its function\r\nas far as the waters are concerned, and now arises the opportunity\r\nfor the animal. In what form shall it appear? Many of its higher\r\nforms, those which depend upon animal food or on the more complex\r\nplants for subsistence, would obviously be unsuitable. Further, the\r\nsea-water is still too much saturated with saline matter to be fit\r\nfor the higher animals of the waters. Still further, there may be a\r\nresidue of internal heat forbidding coolness, and that solution of free\r\noxygen which is an essential condition of existence to most of the\r\nmodern animals.[46] Something must be found suitable for this saline,\r\nimperfectly oxygenated, tepid sea. Something too is wanted that can aid\r\nin introducing conditions more favourable to higher life in the future.\r\nOur experience of the modern world shows us that all these conditions\r\ncan be better fulfilled by the Protozoa than by any other creatures.\r\nThey can live now equally in those great depths of ocean where the\r\nconditions are most unfavourable to other forms of life, and in tepid\r\nunhealthy pools overstocked with vegetable matter in a state of\r\nputridity. They form a most suitable basis for higher forms of life.\r\nThey have remarkable powers of removing mineral matters from the waters\r\nand of fixing them in solid forms. So in the fitness of things Eozoon\r\nis just what we need, and after it has spread itself over the mud and\r\nrock of the primeval seas, and built up extensive reefs therein, other\r\nanimals may be introduced capable of feeding on it, or of sheltering\r\nthemselves in its stony masses, and thus we have the appropriate dawn\r\nof animal life.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 46: It has been assumed that any temperature over 120°\r\nFahrenheit would be incompatible with ordinary aquatic life. Still such\r\nlife is at least possible in some form up to 200°.]\r\n\r\nBut what are we to say of the cause of this new series of facts, so\r\nwonderfully superimposed upon the merely vegetable and mineral? Must\r\nit remain to us as an act of creation, or was it derived from some\r\npre-existing matter in which it had been potentially present ? Science\r\nfails to inform us, but conjectural \"phylogeny\" steps in and takes its\r\nplace. Haeckel, one of the prophets of this new philosophy, waves his\r\nmagic wand, and simple masses of sarcode spring from inorganic matter,\r\nand form diffused sheets of sea-slime, from which are in time separated\r\ndistinct Amœboid and Foraminiferal forms. Experience, however, gives us\r\nno facts whereon to build this supposition, and it remains neither more\r\nnor less scientific or certain than that old fancy of the Egyptians,\r\nwhich derived animals from the fertile mud of the Nile.\r\n\r\nIf we fail to learn anything of the origin of Eozoon, and if its\r\nlife-processes are just as inscrutable as those of higher creatures,\r\nwe can at least inquire as to its history in geological time. In this\r\nrespect we find in the first place that the Protozoa have not had\r\na monopoly in their profession of accumulators of calcareous rock.\r\nOriginated by Eozoon in the old Laurentian time, this process has\r\nbeen proceeding throughout the geological ages; and while Protozoa,\r\nequally simple with the great prototype of the race, have been and\r\nare continuing its function, and producing new limestones in every\r\ngeological period, and so adding to the volume of the successive\r\nformations, new workers of higher grades have been introduced, capable\r\nof enjoying higher forms of animal activity, and equally of labouring\r\nat the great task of continent-building; of existing, too, in seas\r\nless rich in mineral substances than those of the Eozoic time, and for\r\nthat very reason better suited to higher and more skilled artists.\r\nIt is to be observed in connection with this, that as the work of\r\nthe Foraminifers has thus been assumed by others, their size and\r\nimportance have diminished, and the grander forms of more recent times\r\nhave some of them been fain to build up their hard parts of cemented\r\nsand instead of limestone.\r\n\r\nBut we further find that, while the first though not the only organic\r\ngatherers of limestone from the ocean waters, they have had to do, not\r\nmerely with the formation of calcareous sediments, but also with that\r\nof silicious deposits. The greenish silicate called glauconite, or\r\ngreen-sand, is found to be associated with much of the foraminiferal\r\nslime now accumulating in the ocean, and also with the older deposits\r\nof this kind now consolidated in chalks and similar rocks. This name\r\nglauconite is, as Dr. Hunt has shown, employed to designate not only\r\nthe hydrous silicate of iron and potash, which perhaps has the best\r\nright to it, but also compounds which contain in addition large\r\npercentages of alumina, or magnesia, or both; and one glauconite from\r\nthe Tertiary limestones near Paris is said to be a true serpentine,\r\nor hydrous silicate of magnesia.[47] Now the association of such\r\nsubstances with Foraminifera is not purely accidental. Just as a\r\nfragment of decaying wood, imbedded in sediment, has the power of\r\ndecomposing soluble silicates carried to it by water, and parting with\r\nits carbon in the form of carbonic acid, in exchange for the silica,\r\nand thus replacing, particle by particle, the carbon of the wood with\r\nsilicon, so that at length it becomes petrified into a flinty mass, so\r\nthe sarcode of a Foraminifer can in like manner abstract silica from\r\nthe surrounding water or water-soaked sediment. From some peculiarity\r\nin the conditions of the case, however, our Protozoon usually becomes\r\npetrified with a hydrous silicate instead of with pure silica. The\r\nfavourable conditions presented by the deep sea for the combination\r\nof silica with bases, as indicated in the reports of the _Challenger_\r\nalready referred to, may perhaps account in part for this. But whatever\r\nthe cause, it is usual to find fossil Foraminifera with their sarcode\r\nreplaced by such material. We also find beds of glauconite retaining\r\nthe forms of Foraminifera, while the calcareous tests of these have\r\nbeen removed, apparently by acid waters.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 47: Berthier, quoted by Hunt.]\r\n\r\nOne consideration which, though conjectural, deserves notice, is\r\nconnected with the food of these humble animals. They are known to feed\r\nto a large extent on minute plants, the Diatoms, and other organisms\r\nhaving silica in their skeletons or cell-walls, and consequently\r\nsoluble silicates in their juices. The silicious matter contained\r\nin these organisms is not wanted by the Foraminifera for their own\r\nskeletons, and will therefore be voided by them as an excrementitious\r\nmatter. In this way, where Foraminifera greatly abound, there may be\r\na large production of soluble silica and silicates, in a condition\r\nready to enter into new and insoluble compounds, and to fill the\r\ncavities and pores of dead shells. Thus glauconite and even serpentine\r\nmay, in a certain sense, be a sort of foraminiferal coprolitic matter\r\nor excrement. Of course it is not necessary to suppose that this is\r\nthe only source of such materials. They may be formed in other ways,\r\nand especially by the disintegration of volcanic ashes and lapilli\r\nin the sea-bottom; but I suggest this as at least a possible link of\r\nconnection.\r\n\r\nWhether or not the conjecture last mentioned has any validity, there is\r\nanother and most curious bond of connection between oceanic Protozoa\r\nand silicious deposits. Professor Wyville Thompson reports from the\r\n_Challenger_ soundings, that in certain areas of the South Pacific\r\nthe ordinary foraminiferal ooze is replaced by a peculiar red clay,\r\nwhich he attributes to the action of water laden with carbonic\r\nacid, in removing all the lime, and leaving this red mud as a sort\r\nof ash, composed of silica, alumina, and iron oxide. Now this is in\r\nall probability a product of the decomposition and oxidation of the\r\nglauconitic matter contained in the ooze. Thus we learn that when\r\nareas on which calcareous deposits have been accumulated by Protozoa\r\nare invaded by cold arctic or antarctic waters charged with carbonic\r\nacid, the carbonate of lime may be removed, and the glauconite left, or\r\neven the latter may be decomposed, leaving silicious, aluminous, and\r\nother deposits, which may be quite destitute of any organic structures,\r\nor retain only such remnants of them as have been accidentally or by\r\ntheir more resisting character protected from destruction.[48] In this\r\nway it may be possible that many silicious rocks of the Laurentian\r\nand Primordial ages, which now show no trace of organization, may be\r\nindirectly products of the action of life. In any case it seems plain\r\nthat beds of green-sand and similar hydrous silicates may be the\r\nresidue of thick deposits of foraminiferal limestone or chalky matter,\r\nand that these silicates may in their turn be oxidized and decomposed,\r\nleaving beds of apparently inorganic clay. Such beds may finally be\r\nconsolidated and rendered crystalline by metamorphism, and thus a\r\ngreat variety of silicated rocks may result, retaining little or no\r\nindication of any connection with the agency of life. We can scarcely\r\nyet conjecture the amount of light which these new facts may eventually\r\nthrow on the serpentine and other rocks of the Eozoic age. In the\r\nmeantime they open up a noble field to chemists and microscopists.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 48: The \"red chalk\" of Antrim, and that of Speeton, contain\r\narenaceous Foraminifera and silicious casts of their shells, apparently\r\ndifferent from typical glauconite, and the extremely fine ferruginous\r\nand argillaceous sediment of these chalks may well be decomposed\r\nglauconitic matter like that of the South Pacific. I have found these\r\nbeds, the hard limestones of the French Neocomian, and the altered\r\ngreen-sands of the Alps, very instructive for comparison with the\r\nLaurentian limestones; and they well deserve study by all interested in\r\nsuch subjects.]\r\n\r\nWhen the marvellous results of recent deep-sea dredgings were first\r\nmade known, and it was found that chalky foraminiferal earth is yet\r\naccumulating in the Atlantic, with sponges and sea-urchins resembling\r\nin many respects those whose remains exist in the chalk, the fact was\r\nexpressed by the statement that we still live in the chalk period.\r\nThus stated, the conclusion is scarcely correct. We do not live in the\r\nchalk period, but the conditions of the chalk period still exist in the\r\ndeep sea. We may say more than this. To some extent the conditions of\r\nthe Laurentian period still exist in the sea, except in so far as they\r\nhave been removed by the action of the Foraminifera and other limestone\r\nbuilders. To those who can realize the enormous lapse of time involved\r\nin the geological history of the earth, this conveys an impression\r\nalmost of eternity in the existence of this oldest of all the families\r\nof the animal kingdom.\r\n\r\nWe are still more deeply impressed with this when we bring into view\r\nthe great physical changes which have occurred since the dawn of life.\r\nWhen we consider that the skeletons of Eozoon contribute to form the\r\noldest hills of our continents; that they have been sealed up in solid\r\nmarble, and that they are associated with hard crystalline rocks\r\ncontorted in the most fantastic manner; that these rocks have, almost\r\nfrom the beginning of geological time, been undergoing waste to supply\r\nthe material of new formations; that they have witnessed innumerable\r\nsubsidences and elevations of the continents; and that the greatest\r\nmountain chains of the earth have been built up from the sea since\r\nEozoon began to exist,--we acquire a most profound impression of the\r\npersistence of the lower forms of animal life, and know that mountains\r\nmay be removed and continents swept away and replaced, before the least\r\nof the humble gelatinous Protozoa can finally perish. Life may be a\r\nfleeting thing in the individual, but as handed down through successive\r\ngenerations of beings, and as a constant animating power in successive\r\norganisms, it appears, like its Creator, eternal.\r\n\r\nThis leads to another and very serious question. How long did lineal\r\ndescendants of Eozoon exist, and do they still exist ? We may for\r\nthe present consider this question apart from ideas of derivation\r\nand elevation into higher planes of existence of which, in point of\r\nfact, we have no actual evidence. Eozoon as a species and even as a\r\ngenus may cease to exist with the Eozoic age, and we have no proof\r\nthat any succeeding forms of Protozoa are its modified descendants.\r\nWhatever the causes which produced the earliest Protozoan, they may\r\nhave continued more or less to be operative in succeeding ages. As far\r\nas their structures inform us, they may as much claim to be original\r\ncreations as Eozoon itself. Still descendants of Eozoon may have\r\ncontinued to exist, though we have not yet met with them. I should not\r\nbe surprised to hear of a veritable specimen being some day dredged\r\nalive in the Atlantic or the Pacific. It is also to be observed that\r\nin animals so simple as Eozoon many varieties may appear, widely\r\ndifferent from the original. In these the general form and habit of\r\nlife are the most likely things to change, the minute structures much\r\nless so. We need not, therefore, be surprised to find its descendants\r\ndiminishing in size or altering in general form, while the characters\r\nof the fine tubulation and of the canal system would remain. We need\r\nnot wonder if any sessile Foraminifer of the Nummuline group should\r\nprove to be a descendant of Eozoon. It would be less likely that a\r\nSponge or a Foraminifer of the Rotaline type should originate from\r\nit. If one could only secure a succession of deep-sea limestones\r\nwith Foraminifers, extending all the way from the Laurentian to the\r\npresent time, I can imagine nothing more interesting than to compare\r\nthe whole series, with the view of ascertaining the limits of descent\r\nwith variation, and the points where new forms are introduced. We have\r\nnot yet such a series, but it may be obtained; and as Foraminifera\r\nare eminently cosmopolitan, occurring over vastly wide areas of\r\nsea-bottom, and are very variable, they would afford a better test of\r\ntheories of derivation than any that can be obtained from the more\r\nlocally distributed and less variable animals of higher grade. I was\r\nmuch struck with this recently, in examining a series of Foraminifera\r\nfrom the Cretaceous of Manitoba, and comparing them with the varietal\r\nforms of the same species in the interior of Nebraska, 500 miles to\r\nthe south, and with those of the English chalk and of the modern seas.\r\nIn all these different times and places we had the same species. In\r\nall they existed under so many varietal forms passing into each other,\r\nthat in former times every species had been multiplied into several.\r\nYet in all, the identical varietal forms were repeated with the most\r\nminute markings alike. Here were at once constancy the most remarkable\r\nand variations the most extensive. If we dwell on the one to the\r\nexclusion of the other, we reach only one-sided conclusions, imperfect\r\nand unsatisfactory. By taking both in connection we can alone realize\r\nthe full significance of the facts. We cannot yet obtain such series\r\nfor all geological time; but it may even now be worth while to inquire,\r\nWhat do we know as to any modification in the case of the primeval\r\nForaminifers, whether with reference to the derivation from them of\r\nother Protozoa or of higher forms of life?\r\n\r\nThere is no link whatever in geological fact to connect Eozoon with any\r\nof the Mollusks, Radiates, or Crustaceans of the succeeding Palæozoic.\r\nWhat may be discovered in the future we cannot conjecture; but at\r\npresent these stand before us as distinct creations. It would, of\r\ncourse, be more probable that Eozoon should be the ancestor of some\r\nof the Foraminifera of the Primordial age, but strangely enough it is\r\nvery dissimilar from all these except Cryptozoon; and here, as already\r\nstated, the evidence of minute structure fails to a great extent, and\r\nEozoon Bavaricum of the Huronian age scarcely helps to bridge over the\r\ngap which yawns in our imperfect geological record. Of actual facts,\r\ntherefore, we have none; and those evolutionists who have regarded the\r\ndawn-animal as an evidence in their favour, have been obliged to have\r\nrecourse to supposition and assumption.\r\n\r\nTaking the ground of the derivationist, it is convenient to assume\r\n(1) that Eozoon was either the first or nearly the first of animals,\r\nand that, being a Protozoan of simple structure, it constitutes an\r\nappropriate beginning of life; (2) that it originated from some\r\nunexplained change in the protoplasmic or albuminous matter of some\r\nhumble plant, or directly from inorganic matter, or at least was\r\ndescended from some creature only a little more simple which had\r\nbeing in this way; (3) that it had in itself unlimited capacities\r\nfor variation and also for extension in time; (4) that it tended to\r\nmultiply rapidly, and at last so to occupy the ocean that a struggle\r\nfor existence arose; (5) that though at first, from the very nature\r\nof its origin, adapted to the conditions of the world, yet as these\r\nconditions became altered by physical changes, it was induced to\r\naccommodate itself to them, and so to pass into new species and genera,\r\nuntil at last it appeared in entirely new types in the Cambrian fauna.\r\n\r\nThese assumptions are, with the exception of the first two, merely\r\nthe application to Eozoon of what have been called the Darwinian laws\r\nof multiplication, of limited population, of variation, of change\r\nof physical conditions, and of equilibrium of nature. If otherwise\r\nproved, and shown to be applicable to creatures like Eozoon, of course\r\nwe must apply them to it; but in so far as that creature itself is\r\nconcerned they are incapable of proof, and some of them contrary to\r\nsuch evidence as we have. We have, for example, no connecting link\r\nbetween Eozoon and any form of vegetable life. Its structures are such\r\nas to enable us at once to assign it to the animal kingdom, and if we\r\nseek for connecting links between the lower animals and plants, we have\r\nto look for them in the modern waters. We have no reason to conclude\r\nthat Eozoon could multiply so rapidly as to fill all the stations\r\nsuitable for it, and to commence a struggle for existence. On the\r\ncontrary, after the lapse of untold ages the conditions for the life of\r\nForaminifers still exist over two-thirds of the surface of the earth.\r\nIn regard to variation, we have, it is true, evidence of the wide range\r\nof varieties of species in Protozoa, within the limits of the group,\r\nbut none whatever of any tendency to pass into other groups. Nor can\r\nit be proved that the conditions of the ocean were so different in\r\nCambrian or Silurian times as to preclude the continued and comfortable\r\nexistence of Eozoon. New creatures came in which superseded it, and\r\nnew conditions more favourable in proportion to these new creatures;\r\nbut neither the new creatures nor the new conditions were necessarily\r\nor probably connected with Eozoon, any farther than that it may\r\nhave served newer tribes of animals for food, and may have rid the\r\nsea of some of its superfluous lime in their interest. In short, the\r\nhypothesis of evolution will explain the derivation of other animals\r\nfrom Eozoon if we adopt its assumptions, just as it will in that case\r\nexplain anything else; but the assumptions are improbable, and contrary\r\nto such facts as we know.\r\n\r\nEozoon itself, however, bears some negative though damaging testimony\r\nagainst evolution, and I take the liberty of repeating here a summary\r\nof its imaginary autobiography:--\"I, Eozoon Canadense, being a creature\r\nof low organization and intelligence, and of practical turn, am no\r\ntheorist, but have a lively appreciation of such facts as I am able\r\nto perceive. I found myself growing upon the sea-bottom, and know not\r\nwhence I came. I grew and flourished for ages, and found no let or\r\nhindrance to my expansion, and abundance of food was always floated\r\nto me without my having to go in search of it. At length a change\r\ncame. Certain creatures with hard snouts and jaws began to prey on\r\nme. Whence they came I know not; I cannot think that they came from\r\nthe germs which I had dispersed so abundantly throughout the ocean.\r\nUnfortunately, just at the same time lime became a little less abundant\r\nin the waters, perhaps because of the great demands I myself had made,\r\nand thus it was not so easy as before to produce a thick supplemental\r\nskeleton for defence. So I had to give way. I have done my best to\r\navoid extinction; but it is clear that I must at length be overcome,\r\nand must either disappear or subside into a humbler condition, and that\r\nother creatures better provided for the new conditions of the world\r\nmust take my place.\" In such terms we may suppose that this patriarch\r\nof the seas might tell his history, and mourn his destiny, though he\r\nmight also congratulate himself on having in an honest way done his\r\nduty and fulfilled his function in the world, leaving it to other and\r\nperhaps wiser creatures to dispute as to his origin and fate, while,\r\nmuch less perfectly fulfilling the ends of their own existence.\r\n\r\nThus our dawn-animal has positively no story to tell as to his own\r\nintroduction or his transmutation into other forms of existence. He\r\nleaves the mystery of creation where it was; but in connection with\r\nthe subsequent history of life we can learn from him a little as to\r\nthe laws which have governed the succession of animals in geological\r\ntime. First, we may learn that the plan of creation has been\r\nprogressive, that there has been an advance from the few, low, and\r\ngeneralized types of the primeval ocean to the more numerous, higher,\r\nand more specialized types of more recent times. Secondly, we learn\r\nthat the lower types, when first introduced, and before they were\r\nsubordinated to higher forms of life, existed in some of their grandest\r\nmodifications as to form and complexity, and occupied very important\r\nplaces in the economy of the world, and that in succeeding ages, when\r\nhigher types were replacing them they were subjected to decay and\r\ndegeneracy. Thirdly, we learn that while the species has a limited term\r\nof existence in geological time, any grand type of animal existence,\r\nlike that of the Foraminifera or of the Sponges, once introduced,\r\ncontinues and finds throughout all the vicissitudes of the earth some\r\nappropriate residence. Fourthly, as to the mode of introduction of new\r\ntypes, or whether such creatures as Eozoon had any direct connection\r\nwith the subsequent introduction of mollusks, worms, or crustaceans, it\r\nis altogether silent, nor can it predict anything as to the order or\r\nmanner of their introduction.\r\n\r\nHad we been permitted to visit the Laurentian seas, and to study\r\nEozoon and its contemporary Protozoa when alive, it is plain that we\r\ncould not have foreseen or predicted from the consideration of such\r\norganisms the future development of life. No amount of study of the\r\nprototypal Foraminifer could have led us distinctly to the conception\r\nof even a Sponge or a Polyp, much less of any of the higher animals.\r\nWhy is this? The answer is that the improvement into such higher types\r\ndoes not take place by any change of the elementary sarcode, either in\r\nthose chemical, mechanical, or vital properties which we can study, but\r\nin the adding to it of new structures. In the Sponge, which is perhaps\r\nthe nearest type of all, we have the movable pulsating cilium and true\r\nanimal cellular tissue, and along with this the spicular or fibrous\r\nskeleton, these structures leading to an entire change in the mode of\r\nlife and subsistence. In the higher types of animals it is the same.\r\nEven in the highest we have white blood-corpuscles and germinal matter,\r\nwhich, in so far as we know, carry on no higher functions of life than\r\nthose of an Amœba; but they are now made subordinate to other kinds of\r\ntissue, of great variety and complexity, which never have been observed\r\nto arise out of the growth of any Protozoon. There would be only a\r\nvery few conceivable inferences which the highest finite intelligence\r\ncould deduce as to the development of future and higher animals. He\r\nmight infer that the foraminiferal sarcode, once introduced, might be\r\nthe substratum or foundation of other but unknown tissues in the higher\r\nanimals, and that the Protozoan type might continue to subsist side\r\nby side with higher forms of living things as they were successively\r\nintroduced. He might also infer that the elevation of the animal\r\nkingdom would take place with reference to those new properties of\r\nsensation and voluntary motion in which the humblest animals diverge\r\nfrom the life of the plant.\r\n\r\nIt is important that these points should be clearly before our minds,\r\nbecause there has been current of late among naturalists a loose way\r\nof writing with reference to them, which seems to have imposed on many\r\nwho are not naturalists. It has been said, for example, that such an\r\norganism as Eozoon may include potentially all the structures and\r\nfunctions of the higher animals, and that it is possible that we might\r\nbe able to infer or calculate all these with as much certainty as we\r\ncan calculate an eclipse or any other physical phenomenon. Now, there\r\nis not only no foundation in fact for these assertions, but it is from\r\nour present standpoint not conceivable that they can ever be realized.\r\nThe laws of inorganic matter give no data whence any _à priori_\r\ndeductions or calculations could be made as to the structure and\r\nvital forces of the plant. The plant gives no data from which we can\r\ncalculate the functions of the animal. The Protozoon gives no data from\r\nwhich we can calculate the specialties of the Mollusc, the Articulate,\r\nor the Vertebrate. Nor unhappily do the present conditions of life of\r\nthemselves give us any sure grounds for predicting the new creations\r\nthat may be in store for our old planet. Those who think to build a\r\nphilosophy and even a religion on such data are mere dreamers, and have\r\nno scientific basis for their dogmas. They are more blind guides than\r\nour primeval Protozoon himself would be, in matters whose real solution\r\nlies in the harmony of our own higher and immaterial nature with the\r\nBeing who is the author of all life--the Father \"from whom every family\r\nin heaven and earth is named.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                      _SOME GENERAL CONCLUSIONS_\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  XI\r\n\r\n                      _SOME GENERAL CONCLUSIONS_\r\n\r\n\r\nIt may very properly be said that many elements of uncertainty\r\naccompany the questions discussed in the previous chapters, and that\r\nin any case our information is too scanty to warrant any positive\r\nconclusions respecting the origin and earliest history of living\r\nbeings. On the other hand, it is well to take stock of what we do know,\r\nand even of what we may reasonably suppose; keeping always in view\r\nthe fact that some parts of the problem of the origin of life are at\r\npresent insoluble, and may possibly ever continue in that condition. I\r\nmay, therefore, profitably close with a summary of what at present seem\r\nto be ultimate facts and principles in this matter, which, if we have\r\nnot yet fully attained to, we may at least keep in view as objective\r\npoints.\r\n\r\nIf we admit that Eozoon was an animal, we may either assume that it\r\nwas the first introduced on the earth, or that there were earlier and\r\npossibly even simpler creatures. In either case we begin the chain of\r\nanimal life with a Protozoan belonging to one of the simpler or more\r\ngeneralized types of that group, and entitled to the name, both because\r\nof its place in order of time and of rank in the development of the\r\nanimal kingdom. If we deny the claims of Eozoon, then the base of our\r\nanimal system must for the present be found in the Sponges, Worms,\r\nForaminifera, and Radiolarians of the Huronian, with the problematical\r\nlaminated forms allied to Cryptozoon which seem to occur even in the\r\nUpper Laurentian. Thus in this case the miracle of creation stands\r\nbefore us in a somewhat more complex form, though greatly less so than\r\nif we had to accept the fauna of the Lower Cambrian as the oldest known.\r\n\r\nUnder any supposition we cannot hope to get beyond a Protozoan or a\r\nfew Protozoa, and we must assume that these could perform perfectly\r\nin their simple way those functions of assimilation, organic\r\ngrowth, reproduction, sensation, and spontaneous motion, which are\r\ncharacteristic of these lowest forms of life in the present world.\r\n\r\nIt is plain, finally, that however simple we imagine this first\r\npossessor of animal life to be, we can have no scientific evidence\r\nof its origination either as an embryo or as an adult. If it had no\r\nliving ancestors, we are thus face to face with the problem of the\r\norigin of animal life, either by what has been termed \"Abiogenesis\" of\r\na merely physical and fortuitous kind, or by creation. This implies\r\nthe previous production of the complex organic compound known as\r\n\"Protoplasm,\" which can, so far as we know, be produced only through\r\nthe agency of previously living \"Protoplasm\" formed by living plants.\r\nWe have, therefore, to presuppose the \"Abiogenesis\" or creation of\r\nplants as predecessors of the animal; but here the same difficulty\r\nmeets us. We have next to imagine the spontaneous origin of the\r\nstructures of the \"Protozoon\"--its outer and inner substance, its\r\nnucleus, its pulsating vesicle, and its pseudopods, with its protective\r\ntest, and its endowment with vital powers of locomotion, sensation,\r\nassimilation, nutrition, and reproduction. Can we suppose that all this\r\ncould come of the chance interaction of physical causes?\r\n\r\nAt present the production of the living from the non-living seems to\r\nbe an impossibility, and the suggestion that at some vastly distant\r\npoint of past time physical conditions may have been so different\r\nfrom those at present existing as to permit spontaneous generation\r\nis of no scientific value. But if the existence of one primitive\r\nProtozoon be granted, what reason have we to believe that it contains\r\npotentially the germ of all the succeeding creatures in the great chain\r\nof life, and the power of co-ordinating these with the successive\r\nphysical changes of the geological ages, and so producing the vast and\r\ncomplicated system of the animal kingdom, extending up to the present\r\ntime? In doing so, we either elevate a low form of animal life into\r\nthe role of Creator, or fall back on indefinite chance, with infinite\r\nprobabilities against us. Reason, in short, requires us to believe in\r\na First Cause, self-existent, omnipotent and all-wise, designing from\r\nthe first a great and homogeneous plan, of which as yet but little\r\nhas been discovered by us. Thus any rational scheme of development of\r\nthe earth's population in geological time must be, not an agnostic\r\nevolution, but a reverent inquiry into the mode by which it pleased the\r\nCreator to proceed in His great work.\r\n\r\nRegarding the matter in this way, there is legitimate scope for science\r\nin tracing the long lines of the different types of ancient animals to\r\nthe modern period, and endeavouring to discover which of our so-called\r\nspecies are original types and which are mere derivative varieties or\r\nraces.\r\n\r\nIt is evident that nothing is gained here by assuming that the whole\r\ngeological record is but one of innumerable vast æons of æons, which\r\nhave gone on in endless succession. If the world is made to stand\r\non an elephant, and this on a tortoise, and this on lower forms, it\r\nhelps us not at all if the last supporter must stand on nothing. The\r\ndifficulty thus postponed only becomes greater; and at the end we have\r\nto imagine, not only life and organization, but even matter and energy\r\nas fortuitously originating or creating themselves, unless produced by\r\nan Almighty Eternal Will.\r\n\r\nIn pursuing studies of this kind, it is best for the present to content\r\nourselves with tracing the continuous chains of similar creatures\r\nthroughout their extension in geological time, rather than to seek for\r\nconnecting links between different lines of being. I endeavoured some\r\nyears ago to give a popular outline of this method in a little work\r\nentitled \"The Chain of Life in Geological Time.\"[49]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 49: Religious Tract Society, London; Revell Publishing Co.,\r\nNew York, Chicago, and Toronto.]\r\n\r\nTaking, for example, the earliest Protozoa--the Foraminifera and\r\nRadiolaria--we find two lines of being that in endless varieties, but\r\nwith little material change, extend from the earliest periods to the\r\npresent time. In successive ages they are represented by families,\r\ngenera, and species, which are regarded as distinct, and known by\r\ndifferent names. But these humble animals are very variable, and what\r\nseem to us to be new types may be merely varieties of ancestral forms.\r\nWe might even affirm that, for all we know, these two great groups,\r\nas they exist in the present ocean, are lineal descendants of those\r\nthat flourished in the Eozoic. We could not prove this, unless we were\r\nto find somewhere a continuous succession of deep-sea deposits that\r\nwould show the gradual changes that had occurred. On the other hand, it\r\nis hard to believe that one individual life, so to speak, could have\r\ncontinued unimpaired to animate successive and increasing masses of\r\nmatter in all the vast time extending from the Eozoic to the modern.\r\nIt is also at least equally possible that the causes and conditions,\r\nwhatever they were, that produced the earliest Protozoa may have acted\r\nagain and again in later times, originating new lines of descent with\r\nrenewed vitality.\r\n\r\nStill, the tracing of these almost incredibly long lines of descent,\r\nif they are such, is a proper, though difficult, subject of scientific\r\nresearch, whatever may be the result. Something has been attempted in\r\nthis direction over limited portions of time; but a vast amount of\r\npatient labour is required before certainty can be attained even in\r\nthis department of investigation.\r\n\r\nWhen, on the other hand, we turn to the question whether such lines\r\nof creation or descent have given off branches leading to new types,\r\nas, for instance, from Protozoa to various Crustaceans or Mollusks,\r\nwe are entirely destitute of facts, and the statement lately made\r\nby a leading agnostic evolutionist, that \"if there is any truth in\r\nthe doctrine of evolution, every class of the animal kingdom must be\r\nvastly older than the past records of its appearance on the surface of\r\nthe globe,\" shows us that all the attempts to construct genealogical\r\ntrees of the descent of animals are, so far as at present known, quite\r\nvisionary. It seems, indeed, that each leading line, as we trace it\r\nback, ends in a blind alley, just where we might suppose that it was\r\nabout to pass into another path. This is one reason of the frequent\r\ncomplaints as to the imperfection of the geological record, and of the\r\noccurrence of \"missing links\" between different types of being. The\r\nonly feasible explanations of this are as yet the suppositions that\r\nthe times of introduction of new types may have been unfavourable to\r\nthe preservation of their remains, or that the first representatives\r\nof each new group were soft-bodied animals incapable of preservation,\r\nor that they happened to be introduced in regions yet unexplored. But\r\nsuch accidents could scarcely have been the rule in every case. Even in\r\nrelation to man himself, he is still man in all the deposits in which\r\nwe can find his remains, and as remote from the apes of his time, in so\r\nfar as we know, as he is from those now his contemporaries. It would\r\nseem, in short, as if, ashamed of his humble origin, he had carefully\r\nobliterated his tracks in ascending from his lowly parentage to the\r\ndignity of humanity. But in this he is only following the example of\r\nother animals, his predecessors. We may, as is now constantly done\r\nby evolutionists, fill up these gaps by plausible conjectures; but\r\nthis is not a scientific mode of procedure, unless we are content to\r\nregard these conjectures as working hypotheses in aid of researches yet\r\nwithout result.\r\n\r\nIt is important that general truths of this kind, impressed upon us by\r\nour descent to the ascertained beginnings of life, should be generally\r\nknown, as counteractive to the confident statements so frequently put\r\nforth by enthusiastic speculators and caterers of sensational popular\r\nscience. In point of fact, we still occupy the position so long ago\r\ndefined by the Apostle Paul, that \"God's invisible things from the\r\ncreation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by the things\r\nthat are made, even His eternal power and divinity\"; and the rational\r\nstudent of nature must still be a pupil in the school of the Almighty\r\nMaker of all things.\r\n\r\nRealizing this, we can learn something both as to the dignity and the\r\nhumility of our own position. On the one hand we perceive that, in\r\nthe whole chain of life, man is the only being in the likeness of the\r\nMaker, fitted to be His deputy in the world, to understand His great\r\nwork, and to be the heir of the whole. To man alone He has proclaimed,\r\n\"I have said ye are gods, and all of you children of the Most High.\" To\r\nman alone has He given that \"inspiration of the Almighty\" which makes\r\nHim the interpreter of nature. On the other hand, when we consider the\r\nlong extent in time of the great chain of life before man, and along\r\nwith this the vast oceanic area inaccessible to us, yet ever since the\r\ndawn of life teeming with living things innumerable, we find that man\r\nis not even in this little world the only object of Divine care, and we\r\nlearn a lesson of humility and of the obligations which rest on us not\r\nonly in relation to our fellow-men, but toward our humbler companions\r\nwho share with us the care of their Father and ours.\r\n\r\nFinally, it is plain that scientific investigation can never bring us\r\nwithin reach of the absolute origin of life, otherwise than by the\r\naction of a creative Will. Had we stood on the earliest shore, and had\r\nwe seen living things appear in the waters where before had been merely\r\ninorganic sand or rock, we should have known as little as we know\r\nto-day of even the proximate causes of this new departure in nature.\r\nIf agnostics, we might have said, \"this is spontaneous generation\";\r\nbut such an expression would convey no distinct idea of the nature\r\nof the change which had occurred. It would be merely a cloak for our\r\nignorance. If theists, we might say, \"this is creation\"; but we would\r\nhave heard no audible fiat, nor seen any process or manipulation, nor\r\nknown by what subordinate agency, if any, the result was produced. We\r\ncould have given no further explanation than that of the ancient writer\r\nwho tells us that God said, \"Let the waters swarm with swarmers.\" We\r\nare told that when these great creative changes occurred, they were\r\nwitnessed by higher intelligences than man. \"Then the morning stars\r\nsang together, and all the sons of God shouted for joy\"[50]; but\r\neven they could perhaps know little more than we, though they might\r\nbe better able to trace the future development of the wonderful plan\r\ncommenced in the humble Protozoa and culminating in man and immortality.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 50: Job xxxviii. 7.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                 _APPENDIX_\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                 _APPENDIX_\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nA. Geological Relations of Eozoon, Archæozoon, etc.\r\n\r\nIN the text I have given the arrangement of the pre-Cambrian\r\nrock-formations of Canada, as understood by me at the time of the\r\ndelivery of the lectures on which this work is based--an arrangement\r\nwhich I believe will, in the main, be sustained by the work of the\r\nfuture, but which cannot as yet be received as final. The work of\r\nLogan and Murray, so far as I have had opportunity to go over their\r\nground, was admirable; but since their time the progress in the\r\nsettlement of the country, the extension of railways, and other means\r\nof communication, and the opening up of mineral deposits have greatly\r\nincreased the means of obtaining information, and detailed explorations\r\nhave been in progress under the Geological Survey of Canada. At this\r\nmoment, under the new Director of the Survey, Dr. G. M. Dawson, much\r\nwork is being done in this difficult field, more especially by Dr.\r\nElls, Dr. Adams, and Mr. Barlow, which it may be hoped will go far\r\nto settle finally the arrangement and distribution of pre-Cambrian\r\nrocks in the Northern part of the American Continent. The maps and\r\ndetailed reports representing these explorations are not yet before\r\nthe public, but from some preliminary notices which have appeared in\r\nscientific periodicals, it may be inferred that the distinction between\r\nthe fundamental gneiss, with its associated igneous products, and the\r\nUpper Laurentian, will become greater than was supposed by Logan. The\r\nLowest Laurentian or Trembling Mountain series of Logan now represents\r\na very widely extended basement formation, not so far as can be\r\nascertained, composed of sedimentary rocks in a metamorphosed state,\r\nbut rather of peculiar aqueo-igneous materials, different from the\r\ngreater part of those which succeeded them, and associated with varied\r\nand extensive igneous intrusions and _in-meltings_ like those which\r\nKeilhau ascertained long ago in the case of similar rocks in Norway.\r\nThe Grenville series, on the other hand, may prove to be a remnant of\r\nan overlying system, originally less extensive or bordering the older\r\ngroup, and greatly attenuated by the enormous denudation which the\r\nwhole region has undergone.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 60.--_Eozoon Canadense._\r\n\r\nPortion of a large specimen.

I have noticed in the text the apparently\r\nwide development of deposits of this age over the area of the Rocky\r\nMountains of Canada, and the corresponding territories in the United\r\nStates. There would seem to be in these regions a great thickness of\r\nunaltered sediments between the Lower Cambrian and the crystalline\r\nrocks below, representing the Huronian and Laurentian. In these very\r\nfew fossils have yet been found, but they afford perhaps the most\r\npromising field, next to their representatives in Newfoundland and\r\nNew Brunswick, for the discovery of the predecessors of the Olenellus\r\nfauna, and the forms of life connecting these with those known in the\r\nHuronian and Laurentian.

Preservation of Organic Remains by Injection with Hydrous Silicates.\r\n\r\nThe late Dr. T. Sterry Hunt contributed to the original paper on\r\nEozoon in the Journal of the Geological Society, a valuable essay on\r\nthe mineralization of fossils by serpentine, glauconite, and allied\r\nhydrous silicates. This was in part reprinted in the notes appended\r\nto one of the chapters of \"The Dawn of Life,\" and the subject was\r\nfurther discussed by Hunt in his invaluable work, \"Chemical and\r\nGeological Essays,\" and more especially in the chapter on the \"Origin\r\nof Crystalline Rocks,\" a chapter which every geologist deserving the\r\nname should study with care.\r\n\r\nI give here some of the more important facts referred to by Hunt, and\r\nmay add that subsequent microscopic studies have familiarized me with\r\nthe occurrence of serpentine and other hydrous silicates as fillings\r\nof the cavities of fossils of various geological ages, insomuch that I\r\nhave come to regard the occurrence of these rocks in association with\r\nfossiliferous limestones as among the best available means to enable us\r\nto ascertain the minute structures of shells, Foraminifera, corals, etc.\r\n\r\nThe following remarks and analyses further illustrate Hunt's views on\r\nthe relations of these minerals, with some of the facts on which they\r\nare based:--\r\n\r\n\"In connection with the Eozoon it is interesting to examine more\r\ncarefully into the nature of the matters which have been called\r\nglauconite or green-sand. These names have been given to substances of\r\nunlike composition, which, however, occur under similar conditions,\r\nand appear to be chemical deposits from water, filling cavities in\r\nminute fossils, or forming grains in sedimentary rocks of various ages.\r\nAlthough greenish in colour, and soft and earthy in texture, it will\r\nbe seen that the various glauconites differ widely in composition.\r\nThe variety best known, and commonly regarded as the type of the\r\nglauconites, is that found in the green-sand of Cretaceous age in\r\nNew Jersey, and in the Tertiary of Alabama; the glauconite from the\r\nLower Silurian rocks of the Upper Mississippi is identical with it\r\nin composition. Analysis shows these glauconites to be essentially\r\nhydrous silicates of protoxyd of iron, with more or less alumina, and\r\nsmall but variable quantities of magnesia, besides a notable amount of\r\npotash. This alkali is, however, sometimes wanting, as appears from\r\nthe analysis of a green-sand from Kent, in England, by that careful\r\nchemist, the late Dr. Edward Turner, and in another examined by\r\nBerthier, from the calcaire grassier, near Paris, which is essentially\r\na serpentine in composition, being a hydrous silicate of magnesia and\r\nprotoxyd of iron. A comparison of these last two will show that the\r\nloganite, which fills the ancient Foraminifer of Burgess, is a silicate\r\nnearly related in composition.\r\n\r\nI.

I cannot doubt that the silicate injecting\r\nCrinoids and other fossils in this limestone must have been introduced\r\ninto these when still recent, and the same remark applies to the\r\nserpentine filling a coral at Lake Chebogamong, and fragments of\r\ncorals at Melbourne, in Eastern Canada, and to the similar mineral\r\nfilling fossils in a limestone from Llangwyllog, in Wales, and in that\r\nof Maxville, Ohio. Hunt regarded all these as coming essentially into\r\nthe same category as regard to general composition and properties. His\r\nanalysis of the minerals from Pole Hill and Llangwyllog is as follows:--\r\n\r\n                   Pole Hill.

In these respects they agree nearly with the\r\nsilicate found by Robert Hoffman, at Raspenau, in Bohemia, where it\r\noccurs in thin layers alternating with picrosmine, and surrounding\r\nmasses of Eozoon in the Laurentian limestones of that region;[51]\r\nthe Eozoon itself being there injected with a hydrous silicate which\r\nmay be described as intermediate between glauconite and chlorite in\r\ncomposition.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 51: _Journ. fur Prakt. Chemie_, Bd., 106 (1869), p. 356.]\r\n\r\nIn the Welsh specimen the silicate is of a deep green colour, except\r\nwhere oxidized, and though only 3 per cent, of the whole, is sufficient\r\nto give it an olive colour and slight serpentinous lustre. In the Pole\r\nHill material, the silicate amounts to 5 per cent, of the whole, and\r\nis of a greyish colour.

Affinities of Eozoon, etc., with more Modern Forms.\r\n\r\nDr. Carpenter, who in admirable papers, which I need not quote\r\nhere,[52] has illustrated in detail the structures of Eozoon, and\r\nshown its resemblance to modern forms, places Eozoon as a generalized\r\ntype between the Nummuline and Rotaline groups of Foraminifera. It\r\nresembles the former in its fine and complicated tubulations, and some\r\nof the larger sessile forms of the latter in its habit of growth.\r\nMore especially, this is near to that of the genera Carpenteria and\r\nPolytrema. In the former, more especially, there are a number of\r\nsomewhat flattened calcareous cells with perforated walls, and built\r\nup in a conical form around a central pipe or funnel into which the\r\napertures of the cells open. A specimen of Carpenteria, enlarged and\r\nhaving the walls of its cells thickened by a supplemental tubulated\r\ndeposit like that of Calcarina, would approach very near to Eozoon.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 52: I may specially refer to the following:--\r\n\r\nW.

Hist._, ser. 4, vol. xiii., pp. 277-284, with two\r\nengravings, 1874.]\r\n\r\nThe question of the general relation of an organism like Eozoon to\r\ncreatures known to us in the modern seas may be answered in either of\r\ntwo ways:--(1) Functionally or in relation to the position of such\r\nan animal in nature: or (2) Zoologically, or with reference to its\r\naffinities to other animals. With reference to the first consideration,\r\nthe answer is plain. The geological function of Eozoon was that of\r\na collector of calcareous matter from the surrounding waters, then\r\nprobably very rich in calcium carbonate, and its role was the same with\r\nthat of the Stromatoporæ and calcareous Sponges, smaller Foraminifera\r\nand Corals in latter times. The answer to the second aspect of the\r\nquestion is less easy. An ordinary observer would at once place\r\nEozoon with the Stromatoporidæ or Layer-corals, which fill or even\r\nconstitute whole beds of limestone in the Cambro-Silurian, Silurian\r\nand Devonian Periods. While, however, Eozoon has been claimed on\r\nthe highest authority for the Rhizopods, the Stromatoporæ and their\r\nallies have been regarded as Sponges, or more recently as Hydroids\r\nallied to the Hydractiniæ and Millepores.[53] I confess that I am not\r\nsatisfied with these interpretations. I have in my collections large\r\nnumbers of encrusting spinous forms, usually called Stromatoporæ, but\r\nwhich I have long set aside as probably Hydractiniæ. There are other\r\nforms with large vertical tubes which I have regarded as corals,\r\nbut some Stromatoporæ seem to be different from either, and I am\r\nstill disposed to regard many of them as Protozoa. Bearing in mind,\r\nhowever, that the Silurian is as remote from the Laurentian on the\r\none hand as from the Tertiary on the other, we might be prepared to\r\nexpect that if the Layer-corals of the Silurian are divisible into\r\ndifferent groups, somewhat widely separated, and we have in the lower\r\nPalæozoic the peculiar type of Cryptozoon, we may be prepared to\r\nexpect in the Laurentian much more generalized forms, less susceptible\r\nof classification in our modern systems. If, therefore, Eozoon were\r\naccessible to us in a living state, I should not be surprised to find\r\nthat--while perhaps more akin to the calcareous-shelled Rhizopods than\r\nto any other modern group--it may have presented points of resemblance\r\nto Sponges or even to Hydroids, in its skeleton and mode of growth, and\r\neven in the arrangement of its soft parts.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 53: See Nicholson and Murie's able memoirs, Publications of\r\nPal. Soc, 1885.]\r\n\r\nTaking this view of its nature and relations, the genus and the\r\nLaurentian species may be characterized as follows:--\r\n\r\n_Genus_ Eozoon, _Dawson_.\r\n\r\nForaminiferal skeletons, with irregular and often confluent cells,\r\narranged in concentric and horizontal laminæ, or sometimes piled in an\r\nacervuline manner. Septal orifices irregularly disposed. Proper wall\r\nfinely tubulated. Intermediate skeleton with branching canals.\r\n\r\nEozoon Canadense, _Dawson_.\r\n\r\nIn inverted conical or rounded masses or thick encrusting sheets,\r\nfrequently of large dimensions. Typical structure stromatoporoid, or\r\nwith concentric calcareous walls, frequently uniting with each other,\r\nand separating flat chambers, more or less mammillated, and spreading\r\ninto horizontal lobes and small chamberlets; chambers often confluent\r\nand crossed by irregular calcareous pillars connecting the opposite\r\nwalls. Upper part often composed of acervuline chambers of rounded\r\nforms. Proper wall tubulated very finely. Intermediate skeleton\r\nlargely developed, especially at the lower part, and traversed by large\r\nbranching canals, often with smaller canals in their interstices. Lower\r\nlaminæ and chambers often three millimetres in thickness. Upper laminæ\r\nand chambers one millimetre or less. Age Upper Laurentian and perhaps\r\nHuronian.\r\n\r\n_Var._ minor.--Supplemental skeleton wanting, except near the base, and\r\nwith very fine canals. Laminæ of sarcode much mammillated, thin, and\r\nseparated by very thin walls. Probably a depauperated variety.\r\n\r\n_Var._ acervulina.--In oval or rounded masses, wholly acervuline. Cells\r\nrounded; intermediate skeleton absent or much reduced; cell-walls\r\ntubulated. This may be a distinct species, but it closely resembles the\r\nacervuline parts of the ordinary form.\r\n\r\nAssuming the Archæospherinæ so abundantly found in the Eozoon\r\nlimestones to be distinct organisms, and not mere germs or buds of\r\nEozoon, they may be thus defined:--\r\n\r\n\r\n_Genus_ Archæospherina, _Dawson_.\r\n\r\nA provisional genus, to include rounded solitary chambers, or\r\nglobigerine assemblages of such chambers, with the cell-wall\r\nsurrounding them tubulated as in Eozoon, or perhaps in some cases with\r\nsimple pores like those of Rotalines. They may be distinct organisms,\r\nor gemmæ, or detached fragments of Eozoon. Some of them much resemble\r\nthe bodies figured by Dr. Carpenter, as gemmæ or ova and primitive\r\nchambers of Orbitolites. They are very abundant on some of the strata\r\nsurfaces of the limestones at Côte St. Pierre. Age Upper Laurentian.\r\n\r\nI may add here the characters of Matthew's new genus, Archæozoon, as\r\ngiven by him:--\r\n\r\n\r\n_Genus_ Archæospherina, _Matthew_.\r\n\r\nSkeleton composed of thin concentric laminæ convex upward, and having\r\nbetween them a granular layer filled with minute branching canals.\r\n\r\nArchæospherina Acadiense, Matthew.\r\n\r\nHabit of growth cylindrical in masses or groups, budding upward. The\r\nmicroscopic characters are thus given by Matthew[54]:--\r\n\r\n\"The structures appear to be allied more closely to Cryptozoon than to\r\nEozoon. The microscopic structure is most easily recognised in the\r\nearthy (as distinguished from the calcareous) layers, and consists\r\nof minute branching canals. Under a one-inch objective the smaller\r\ncanals have the appearance of minute threads, which run sometimes for a\r\ndistance of two millimetres without branching. The larger canals branch\r\nmore frequently and are more sinuous. The canals cross and anastomose\r\nwith each other; they run chiefly at right angles to the axis of the\r\nfossil, and appear to branch most in going outward from the centre.\r\nMore rarely they ascend from the earthy to the calcareous layer,\r\nbranching upward.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 54: Bulletin No. ix., Nat. Hist. Soc of New Brunswick, 1890.]\r\n\r\nIn limestone of the Upper Laurentian, near St. John, New Brunswick.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nD. Cryptozoon.\r\n\r\nThe description above given of Archæozoon very naturally leads us to\r\nconsider the allied Cambrian and pre-Cambrian forms known as Cryptozoon.\r\n\r\nThis remarkable and problematical type was first described by Prof.\r\nJames Hall in the Appendix to his Annual Report of 1882 (No. 26). It\r\nis a large massive organism, occurring abundantly on the surface of a\r\nlimestone of Calciferous (Upper Cambrian) age at Greenfield, Saratoga\r\nCounty, New York. The individuals sometimes attain a diameter of two\r\nfeet, and are often surrounded by smaller specimens apparently budding\r\noff from them. Like Stromatoporæ, they consist of concentric laminæ,\r\nbut these are concave upward, giving a bowl-shaped form to the summits\r\nof the individuals. Prof Hall describes them as \"made up of irregular\r\nconcentric laminæ of greater or less density, and of very unequal\r\nthickness. The substance between the concentric lines in well-preserved\r\nspecimens is traversed by numerous minute irregular canaliculi which\r\nbranch and anastomose without regularity. The central portion of\r\nthe masses is usually filled with crystalline granular and Oolitic\r\nmaterial, and many specimens show the intrusion of these extraneous and\r\ninorganic substances between the laminæ.\"\r\n\r\nProfessor Hall having kindly presented some good specimens to the Peter\r\nRedpath Museum, I have had sections made, and have thus been able to\r\nverify his description, and to compare the structures with those of\r\nsome of the more ancient Stromatoporoid specimens in our collections,\r\nincluding the Archæozoon from New Brunswick, of which Mr. Matthew\r\nhas presented a fine slab to the Museum. I have also, through the\r\nkindness of Professor Winchell, been enabled to compare these with his\r\n_Cryptozoon Minnesotense_, and Dr. Walcott has added specimens of his\r\nStromatoporoid forms from the pre-Cambrian beds of Arizona. It would\r\nappear from these and other specimens in our collections from the\r\nCambrian and older Ordovician beds, that we have here an ancient type\r\nof Stromatoporoid organism in which the original laminæ seem to have\r\nbeen thin and coriaceous, without apparent pores or pillars connecting\r\nthem with each other, but having between them relatively-thick layers\r\nof fine fragmental matter penetrated by numerous irregularly tortuous\r\nand branching tubes. The laminæ often present a carbonaceous or\r\nchitinous appearance, though frequently replaced by mineral matter,\r\nand the intervening layers show both a calcareous and carbonaceous\r\nsubstance, with much fine silicious sand often as rounded grains,\r\nand apparently some dolomitic granules. The tubules seem destitute\r\nof any distinct wall, otherwise the whole would resemble on a large\r\nscale the nodular and laminated masses of _Girvanella_, which Wethered\r\nhas described as surrounding organic fragments in Silurian and\r\nCarboniferous and Jurassic limestones in England.[55]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 55: British Association, Liverpool meeting, 1896.]\r\n\r\nThe _Streptochetus_ of Seely from the Chazy limestone[56] is evidently\r\nvery near to Girvanella, if not generically identical, and I have a\r\nsimilar species from the Lower Cambrian pebbles in the conglomerates\r\nof the Quebec group. In all these forms, however, the thicker or\r\nintermediate laminæ seem to consist wholly of definite convoluted\r\ntubes, whereas in Cryptozoon the tubes, or tubular perforations, are\r\nseparated by a mass of material which in the best preserved specimens\r\nseems to consist of a fibrous stroma including calcareous and silicious\r\nparticles. It seems doubtful to what class of beings such a structure\r\nshould be referred; but whatever its nature, it evidently had great\r\npowers of growth, and seems to be a very ancient form of life.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 56: _Amer.

See Nicholson, \"Manual\r\nof Palæontology,\" ed. of 1889.]\r\n\r\nOne of the species similar in structure to Hall's type, but budding\r\nout into turbinate branches, was discovered by Mr. E. T. Chambers, of\r\nMontreal, in the Ordovician limestone of Lake St. John, and has been\r\nnamed _C. boreale_. It differs in structure from Hall's species in\r\nhaving the tubes less tortuous and more nearly parallel to the laminæ.\r\nIn its outline it reminds one of the problematical Eozoon from the\r\nHastings group at Tudor, Ontario, referred to in the text.\r\n\r\nShould time permit, I hope to have all the specimens in our collections\r\nillustrating this interesting and primitive type examined and\r\ndescribed. In the meantime I may merely remark that a near modern\r\nanalogue would seem to be the gigantic arenaceous Foraminifer _Neusina\r\nAgassizi_, Goës, dredged by Alexander Agassiz in the Pacific, and\r\ndescribed in the Bulletin of the Museum of Comparative Zoology (Vol.\r\nxxiii., No. 5, 1892). The modern form, it is true, is flat and\r\nfoliaceous; but some of the old species approach to this shape, and\r\nif we suppose the little cells of Neusina to represent the tubes of\r\nCryptozoon, and the carbonaceous matter of the latter to be the remains\r\nof the chitinous stroma seen in some specimens, the general resemblance\r\nwill be very close.\r\n\r\nThe whole subject of these peculiar Stromatoporoid forms extending\r\nfrom the Upper Cambrian to the Laurentian, deserves a full and careful\r\ninvestigation, for which I am endeavouring to collect material.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nE. Receptaculites and Archæocyathus.\r\n\r\nIn \"The Dawn of Life\" (1875), reference was made to the singular and\r\ncomplicated organisms of the Upper Cambrian and Ordovician systems\r\nknown as Receptaculites, which at that time was generally regarded as\r\nforaminiferal, and is still placed by Zittel, in his great work on\r\nPalæontology, among forms doubtfully referable to that group. It has\r\nalso been referred to Sponges, though on very uncertain grounds. It has\r\nnot, however, so far as I am informed, been traced any farther back\r\nthan the Upper Cambrian (Calciferous), and no structural links are\r\nknown to connect it with either Eozoon or Archæozoon. For this reason\r\nit was omitted in the text; but I think it well to mention it here, and\r\nto direct attention to it as possibly one of the complex Protozoa which\r\nmay be traced far back toward the beginnings of life.[57]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 57: Billings, \"Palæozoic Times.\"]\r\n\r\nAnother primitive and generalized genus mentioned in the text is\r\n_Archæocyathus_ of Billings, whose headquarters seem to be in the Lower\r\nCambrian, and which may probably be traced farther back.\r\n\r\nMr. Billings described the genus in his \"Report on Canadian Fossils\"\r\n(1861-64), taking _A. profundus_, from the Lower Cambrian of L'Anse à\r\nLoup, on the Labrador coast, in the first instance, as the type.\r\n\r\nA few years later, my attention was attracted to this species by\r\nspecimens presented to me by Mr. Carpenter, a missionary on the\r\nLabrador coast, and which Mr. Billings kindly permitted me to compare\r\nwith his specimens in the Museum of the Geological Survey, collected\r\nby the late Mr. Richardson, at L'Anse à Loup, in Labrador, in what\r\nwere then called Lower Potsdam rocks. Slices of the specimens were\r\nmade for the microscope, when it appeared that, though they had\r\nthe general aspect of turbinate corals, like Petraia, etc., they\r\nwere quite dissimilar in structure, more especially in their porous\r\nouter and inner walls and septa (see Fig. 5, p. 35). Yet they could\r\nscarcely be referred to the group of porous corals known in much later\r\nformations and in the modern seas. Nor could they be referred with\r\nmuch probability to Sponges, as they were composed of solid calcareous\r\nplates, which, as was evident from their textures, could not have been\r\noriginally spicular. One seemed thus shut up to the conclusion that\r\ntheir nearest alliance was with Foraminifera, and if so, they were\r\nvery large and complex forms of that group, consisting of perforated\r\nchambers arranged around a central cavity. I accordingly mentioned them\r\nin this connection in 1875, not as closely related to Eozoon, but as\r\napparently showing the existence of very complex foraminiferal forms in\r\nthe Lower Cambrian.\r\n\r\nThe specimens thus noticed were altogether calcareous, and were of\r\nthe species named _A. profundus_ by Mr. Billings. He had, however,\r\nreferred to the same genus silicified specimens from a later formation,\r\nthe Calciferous (Upper Cambrian) at Mingan, under the name _A.\r\nMinganensis_, which were subsequently found to be associated with\r\nspicules resembling those of lithistid sponges, and which proved to\r\nbe very different from the Lower Cambrian form, and are now referred\r\nto a different genus. The subject had thus become involved in some\r\nconfusion, and was left in this state by Mr. Billings on his death.\r\nI therefore asked my friend, Dr. Hinde, of London, to re-examine my\r\nspecimens, and at the same time those of the Geological Survey were\r\nplaced in his hands by Mr. Whiteaves. Hinde also obtained specimens\r\nfrom Lower Cambrian rocks in Sardinia, where they seem to be abundant,\r\nand from Spain. He states the results of his examinations very fully\r\nin a paper in the Journal of the _Geological Society of London_.[58] He\r\nretains the original name for the older and calcareous form from L'Anse\r\nà Loup, separating from it, however, another form, _A. Atlanticus_\r\nof Billings's, which is destitute of distinct radiating septa and\r\nacervuline, like the lower part of _A. profundus_. This he names\r\n_Spirocyathus_. The Mingan species he places with Sponges under the\r\ngeneric name, _Archæoscyphia_. In this Walcott substantially agrees\r\nwith Hinde in his \"Memoir on the Lower Cambrian Fauna.\" Both seem to\r\nrefer Archæocyathus to corals, though admitting its very exceptional\r\nand anomalous structure. I think, however, we may still be allowed to\r\nentertain some doubts as to the reference to corals, more especially\r\nas the skeleton does not seem to have consisted of aragonite, but of\r\nordinary calcite, like that of the Foraminifera. It is in any case a\r\nprimitive form which seems to be dying out in the Lower Cambrian, and\r\nwe may hope that it may be traced into the pre-Cambrian, and may form a\r\nlink connecting the Palæozoic with the Eozoic faunas. In my description\r\nof it in \"The Dawn of Life\" in 1875, I used the following terms:--\"To\r\nunderstand Archæocyathus, let us imagine an inverted cone of carbonate\r\nof lime from an inch or two to a foot in length, with its point planted\r\nin the mud in the bottom of the sea, while its open cup extends upward\r\ninto the clear water. The lower part buried in the bottom is composed\r\nof an irregular network of thick calcareous plates, enclosing chambers\r\ncommunicating with one another. Above this, where the cup expands, its\r\nwalls are made up of inner and outer plates, perforated with numerous\r\nround pores in vertical rows, and connected with each other by vertical\r\npartitions also perforated, so as to establish a free communication\r\nof the enclosed radiating chambers with each other, as well as with\r\nthe water within and without. Such a structure might no doubt serve as\r\na skeleton for a coral of somewhat peculiar internal structure, but\r\nit might just as well accommodate a protozoan with chambers for its\r\nsarcode, and pores for emission of pseudopods, both outwardly and by\r\nmeans of the interior cup, which in that case would represent a funnel\r\nlike that of Carpenteria, or one of the tubes of Eozoon.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 58: Vol. xlv., 1889, pp. 125 _et seq._]\r\n\r\nOn the whole, when we consider the magnitude and synthetic character\r\nof such forms as Cryptozoon, Receptaculites, and Archæocyathus,\r\nand their association with generalized types of Crustaceans and\r\nBrachiopods, we can scarcely fail to perceive that at the base of the\r\nPalæozoic we are leaving the reign of the higher marine invertebrates,\r\nand entering on a domain where lower and probably Protozoan forms must\r\nbe dominant, and so are getting at least within calculable distance of\r\nthe beginnings of life.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nF. Pre-Geological Evolution.\r\n\r\nReference is incidentally made in the text to the doctrine implied in\r\nthe old notion of successive cataclysms and renewals of the earth,\r\nheld by some ancient mythologies and philosophies, and revived in a\r\nslightly different form by Mr. Herbert Spencer, in connection with the\r\nrequirements of the Darwinian evolution by natural selection. This\r\nprimitive idea was illustrated at considerable length by Professor\r\nPoulton in his address as President of the Zoological Section of the\r\nBritish Association at its meeting in Liverpool (September, 1896). In\r\nthis new and ably presented form, it deserves some notice as excluding\r\nthe hope of our finding the beginnings of life in any geological\r\nformations at present known.\r\n\r\nProfessor Poulton refers to the argument used by Lord Salisbury,\r\nin his address at the Oxford meeting, on the insufficiency of time\r\nfor the requirements of the Darwinian evolution. He then discusses\r\nthe estimates based by Lord Kelvin and Professor Tait on physical\r\nconsiderations, and dismisses them as altogether inadequate, though\r\nhe admits that Professor George Darwin agrees with Lord Kelvin in\r\nregarding 500 millions of years as the maximum duration of the life of\r\nthe sun.\r\n\r\nHe next takes up the estimates of geologists, and rather blames as too\r\nmodest those who ask for the longest time, say 400 millions of years,\r\nfor the duration of the habitable earth. He evidently scarcely deems\r\nworthy of notice the more moderate demands of many eminent students of\r\nthe earth, who have based far lower estimates on more or less reliable\r\ndata of denudation and deposition, and on the thickness of deposits in\r\nconnection with their probable geographical extent.\r\n\r\nHe then proceeds to consider the biological evidence, and dwells on\r\nthe number of distinct types represented as far back as the Lower\r\nCambrian. Independently of the interpretations and explanations\r\nof this great fact, the numerous types there represented, and the\r\npersistence of some of them to the present day, give an almost\r\noverwhelming impression of the vast duration of organisms in time. In\r\nconnection with the supposed slow and gradual process of evolution,\r\nthis naturally leads to the conclusion that \"the whole period in which\r\nthe fossiliferous rocks were laid down must be multiplied several times\r\nfor this later history (that of the higher groups of animals alone).\r\nThe period thus obtained requires to be again increased, and perhaps\r\ndoubled for the earlier history.\" Ordinary geologists naturally stand\r\naghast at such demands, and inquire if they are seriously put forth,\r\nand if it would not be wise to hesitate before accepting a theory on\r\nbehalf of which such drafts on time must be made. The late Edward\r\nForbes once humorously defined a geologist to be \"an amiable enthusiast\r\nwho is happy and content if you will give him any quantity of that\r\nwhich other men least value, namely, past time.\" But had this great\r\nnaturalist lived to \"post-Darwinian\" times, he might have defined a\r\nDarwinian biologist to be an insatiable enthusiast, who feels himself\r\naggrieved if not supplied with infinity itself, wherein to carry on\r\nthe processes of his science. Seriously however, the necessity for\r\nindefinitely protracted time does not arise from the facts, but from\r\nthe attempt to explain the facts without any adequate cause, and to\r\nappeal to an infinite series of chance interactions apart from a\r\ndesigned plan, and without regard to the consideration, that we know of\r\nno way in which, with any conceivable amount of time, the first living\r\nand organized beings could be spontaneously produced from dead matter.\r\nIt is this last difficulty which really blocks the way, and leads to\r\nthe wish to protract indefinitely an imaginary process, which must end\r\nat last in an insuperable difficulty.\r\n\r\nWere Evolutionists content to require a reasonable time for the\r\ndevelopment of life, and to assign this to an adequate cause, they\r\nmight see in the reduction of living things in the pre-Cambrian ages to\r\nfew and generalized or synthetic types, evidence of an actual approach\r\nto the beginnings of life, and beyond this to a condition of the earth\r\nin which life would be impossible.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nG. Controversies Respecting Eozoon.\r\n\r\nIn the text (Chapter IX.) I have referred in a cursory manner to these,\r\nbut have felt that it would be unprofitable to fight the old battles\r\nover again, except in so far as the objections raised have suggested\r\nnew lines of study and investigation. The old objections of Messrs.\r\nRowney, King and Carter were conclusively replied to by the late Dr.\r\nCarpenter. The later criticisms of Möbius in his elaborated memoir\r\nin \"Palæontographica\" were in appearance more formidable; but he had\r\nevidently entered on the question with imperfect material, and a very\r\ndefective conception of its extent and meaning. His treatment of it was\r\nalso marked by unfairness to those who had previously worked at the\r\nsubject, and by that narrow specialism and captious spirit for which\r\nGerman naturalists are too deservedly celebrated. The difficulties he\r\nraised were met at the time, more especially in articles by the present\r\nwriter in the American _Journal of Science_, and in the Canadian\r\nNaturalist. Möbius, I have no doubt, did his best from his special\r\nand limited point of view; but it was a crime which science should\r\nnot readily pardon or forget, on the part of editors of the German\r\nperiodical, to publish and illustrate as scientific material a paper\r\nwhich was so very far from being either fair or adequate.\r\n\r\nThe later objections of Gregory and Lavis are open to similar criticism\r\nas imperfect and partial, and as confounding Eozoon with mineral\r\nstructures which previous writers had carefully distinguished from it.\r\nI have stated these points in letters to _Nature_ and to the Council\r\nof the Dublin Academy, and have also re-stated the evidence bearing on\r\nthe animal nature of Eozoon in a series of papers in the Geological\r\nMagazine for 1895. I may add here, as apposite to the present condition\r\nof the matter, a few remarks referring to the appearance of Eozoon\r\nin Dr. Dallinger's new edition of Carpenter's great work on the\r\nMicroscope,[59] and more especially to his retaining unchanged the\r\ndescription of _Eozoon Canadense_, as a monument of an important\r\nresearch up to a certain date, while adding a note with reference to\r\nthe later criticisms of Mr. Gregory.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 59: _Nature_, March 17, 1892.]\r\n\r\nDr. Carpenter devoted much time to the study of Eozoon, and brought\r\nto bear on it his great experience of foraminiferal forms, and his\r\nwonderful powers of manipulating and unravelling difficult structures.\r\nAfter having spent years in studying microscopic slices of Eozoon and\r\nthe limestones in which it occurs, I have ever felt new astonishment\r\nwhen I saw the manner in which, by various processes of slicing and\r\netching, and by dexterous management of light, he could bring out\r\nthe structure of specimens often very imperfect. Not long before Dr.\r\nCarpenter's death, I had an opportunity to appreciate this in spending\r\na few days with him in studying his more recently acquired specimens,\r\nsome of them from my own collections, and discussing the new points\r\nwhich they exhibited, and which unhappily he did not live to publish.\r\nSome of these new facts, in so far as they related to specimens in our\r\ncabinet here, have since that time been noticed in my _résumé_ of the\r\nquestion in the \"Memoirs of the Peter Redpath Museum,\" 1888.\r\n\r\nThose who know Dr. Carpenter's powers of investigation will not be\r\nastonished that later observers, without his previous preparation\r\nand rare insight, and often with only few and imperfect specimens,\r\nshould have failed to appreciate his results. One is rather surprised\r\nthat some of them have ventured to state with so great confidence\r\ntheir own negative conclusions in a matter of so much difficulty,\r\nand requiring so much knowledge of organic structures in various\r\nstates of mineralization. For myself, after working fifty years at\r\nthe microscopic examination of fossils and organic rocks, I feel more\r\nstrongly than ever the uncertainties and liabilities to error which\r\nbeset such inquiries.\r\n\r\nAs an illustration in the case of Eozoon: since the publication of my\r\nmemoir of 1888, which I had intended to be final and exhaustive as\r\nto the main points in so far as I am concerned, I have had occasion\r\nto have prepared and to examine about 200 slices of Eozoon from new\r\nmaterial; and while most of these have either failed to show the minute\r\nstructures or have presented nothing new, a few have exhibited certain\r\nparts in altogether unexpected perfection, and have shown a prevalence\r\nof injection of the canal system by dolomite not previously suspected.\r\nI have also observed that unsuitable modes of preparation, notably some\r\nof those employed in the preparation of ordinary petrological slices,\r\nmay fail to disclose organic structures in crystalline limestones when\r\nactually present. Since that publication also, the discoveries of Mr.\r\nMatthew in the Laurentian of New Brunswick, and the further study of\r\nthe singular Cambrian forms of the type of Cryptozoon, have opened up\r\nnew fields of inquiry.\r\n\r\nI think it proper to state, in reference to Dr. Dallinger's footnote\r\non the recent paper of Mr. Gregory, that it must not be inferred from\r\nit that Mr. Gregory had access to my specimens from Madoc and Tudor,\r\nthough he no doubt had excellent material from the collections of\r\nthe Canadian Geological Survey. It might also be inferred from this\r\nnote that I have regarded the Madoc and Tudor specimens as \"Lower\r\nLaurentian.\" The fact is, that I was originally induced in 1865, by\r\nthe belief of Sir W. E. Logan at that time that these rocks were\r\nrepresentatives in a less altered state of the middle part of the\r\nLaurentian, to spend some time at Madoc and its vicinity in searching\r\nfor fossils, but discovered only worm-burrows, spicules, and fragments\r\nof Eozoon, which were noticed in the _Journal of the Geological\r\nSociety_ for 1866. (The more complete specimen from Tudor was found by\r\nVennor in 1866.) On that occasion I satisfied myself fully that the\r\nbeds are much older than the Cambro-Silurian strata resting on them,\r\nunconformably; but I felt disposed to regard them as more probably\r\nof the age of some parts of the Huronian of Georgian Bay, which I had\r\nexplored with a similar purpose under Logan's guidance in 1856.\r\n\r\n[In my subsequent notice of the Tudor specimens in \"The Dawn of Life,\"\r\nin 1875, I referred to their age as \"Upper Laurentian or Huronian\";\r\nand I may add, that while it is certain that the beds containing them\r\nare pre-Palæozoic, their place in the Eozoic period is still not\r\nprecisely determined. Work is, however, now in progress which it is\r\nhoped may finally settle the age of the \"Hastings group\" and the old\r\nrocks associated with it. I may add that the specimen of Cryptozoon\r\ndiscovered by Mr. Chambers, and of which a portion is represented\r\nin the Frontispiece, seems to me to throw a new light on the Tudor\r\nspecimen. It shows in any case the survival of Cryptozoa similar\r\nin form and general appearance to that specimen, as late as the\r\nCambro-Silurian or Ordovician.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nH. Notes to Appendix, December, 1896.\r\n\r\nWhile this work was going through the press, I have received the Report\r\nof the U.S. Geological Survey for 1894-95, containing the elaborate\r\nMemoir of C. R. Van Hise on the pre-Cambrian Geology of North America.\r\nIt is a very valuable contribution to the literature of this difficult\r\nsubject, and will constitute a standard book of reference: though I\r\nthink the use of the term \"Algonkian\" for groups of beds which are in\r\npart basal Palæozoic and in part Eozoic or Archæan is to be deprecated,\r\nand scarcely sufficient importance is attached to the labours of the\r\nearly Canadian explorers in this field.\r\n\r\nIn the past summer I was enabled to spend a few days, with the\r\nassistance of my friend Mr. H. Tweeddale Atkin, of Egerton Park, Rock\r\nFerry, in examining the supposed pre-Cambrian rocks of Holyhead Island\r\nand Anglesey. Fossils are very rare in these beds. As Sir A. Geikie\r\nhas shown, the quartzite of Holyhead is in some places perforated with\r\ncylindrical worm-burrows, and in the micaceous shales there are long\r\ncylindrical cords, which may be algæ of the genus _Palæochorda_, and\r\nalso bifurcating fronds resembling _Chondrites_; but I saw no animal\r\nfossils. I have so far been unable to discover organic structure in\r\nthe layers of limestone associated with apparently bedded serpentine\r\nin the southern part of Holyhead Island. In central Anglesey there\r\nare lenticular beds of limestone and dolomite associated with\r\npre-Cambrian rocks, which Dr. Callaway regards as probably equivalent\r\nto the Pebidian of Hicks. In these there are obscure traces of organic\r\nfragments; and in one bed near Bodwrog Church I found a rounded\r\nlaminated body, which may be an imperfectly preserved specimen of\r\nCryptozoon, or some allied organism. The specimens collected have not,\r\nhowever, been yet thoroughly examined. These and other pre-Cambrian\r\ndeposits in Great Britain correspond in their testimony, with the\r\nEozoic rocks of North America, as to the small number and rarity of\r\nfossil remains in the formations below the base of the Palæozoic, and\r\nthe consequent probability that in these formations we are approaching\r\nto the beginning of life on our planet; though there is still reason\r\nto hope that additional oases of life may be found in these deserts\r\nof the pre-Palæozoic. Such rare intervals of fertility should be the\r\nmore valued when the labours of so many skilled observers have proved\r\nso meagre in their results in comparison with the great extent and\r\nthickness of the beds which have been explored.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                    INDEX\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                        PAGE\r\n\r\n  Adams on composition of Laurentian schists             108\r\n  ---- his work on Laurentian stratigraphy               296\r\n  Animals, Cambrian, classes of                        7, 11\r\n  ---- pre-Cambrian                                       53\r\n  ---- Huronian                                           67\r\n  ---- Grenvillian                                   73, 303\r\n  Antiquity, relative                                      6\r\n  Aquatic animals, permanence of                          13\r\n  Aragonite in fossils                                   117\r\n  Archæocyathus                                      35, 315\r\n  Archæozoon                                        214, 309\r\n\r\n  Barlow, his explorations                               296\r\n  Bavaria, Eozoon of                                      71\r\n  Beecher on limbs of Trilobites                          25\r\n  Bicknell on Eozoon                                     141\r\n  Billings on Eozoon                                     137\r\n  ---- on Receptaculites                                 315\r\n  ---- on Archæocyathus                                  316\r\n  ---- on Signal Hill fossils                             54\r\n  Bonney on Côte St. Pierre                              142\r\n  Burbank on Chelmsford Eozoon                           141\r\n\r\n  Calcarina                                              186\r\n  Calumet, Grand, Eozoon of                              130\r\n  Canals of Eozoon                                       133\r\n  Cambrian, life of Early                                 17\r\n  ---- geography of the                                   18\r\n  Carbon in Laurentian limestone                          93\r\n  Carpenter, Dr., on Eozoon                    137, 303, 324\r\n  Cayeux on Huronian fossils                              68\r\n  Chambers, Mr. E.

Minor typos were\r\ncorrected. A web search shows that the anchorless Footnote on page\r\n139 appears to reference the quoted text on page 140. Therefore, the\r\nFootnote was placed after the quoted text.\r\n\r\nOn page 174, Footnote 36 referred twice to Figure 8 and to a\r\n\"Microscopic slice\" as Figure 61 (which does not exist). It is assumed\r\nthe intent was to refer to Figures 7, 7a, 8 and 59 and has been altered\r\nto point to those figures. The caption for Fig. 7 also refers to \"Fig.\r\n61, p. 310\" and has been updated to \"Fig. 59, p. 237\".",
