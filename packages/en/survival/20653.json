Probably this is due\r\nlargely to the fact that most people think of conservation as a problem\r\nfor the federal and state governments, mine owners, great lumber\r\ncompanies, owners of vast tracts of land, and large corporations; and\r\nhave not realized how much the responsibility for the care of our\r\nnatural resources and the penalty for their waste rest with the whole\r\npeople, that every one has a part in this work which has been called\r\n\"the greatest question before the American people.\"\r\n\r\nOne cause of the failure to realize this personal responsibility is that\r\nwhile there have been college text-books and scientific treatises on\r\nvarious branches of the subject, such as Forestry, there has been no\r\nbook treating of the entire problem of our natural resources, their\r\nextent, the amount and nature of their use, their waste, and what may be\r\ndone to conserve them, prepared in a way that can be readily understood\r\nby the ordinary reader, and dealing with the practical, rather than the\r\ntechnical, side.\r\n\r\nIt is to supply the need for such general knowledge, and to show how\r\nsuch saving may be accomplished, that this book has been written. It is\r\ndesigned as a short but complete statement of the entire conservation\r\nquestion, and should be of service for study in teachers' reading\r\ncircles, farmers' institutes, women's clubs, the advanced grades in\r\nschools, and for general library purposes.\r\n\r\nEvery statement of fact bears the weight of authority, for no facts or\r\nfigures are given that have not been verified by government reports,\r\nreports of scientific societies, etc.\r\n\r\nInformation has been gathered from many sources, chief among them being\r\nthe Report of the Conference of Governors at the White House, in May,\r\n1908; the Report of the National Conservation Commission, the Report on\r\nNational Vitality, the Report of the Inland Waterways Commission, of the\r\nGeological Survey, the Census Reports, and many government departmental\r\npamphlets.\r\n\r\nM.

Goldsmith\r\npredicted the certain downfall of lands \"where wealth accumulates and\r\nmen decay,\" but, in the truest, broadest definition, there can be no\r\nnational wealth unless the men and women of the nation are healthy,\r\nintelligent, educated and right-minded. On the other hand it is equally\r\ntrue that if the people of a country are to make the most of themselves\r\nin mind and body; if they are to get the most comfort and happiness out\r\nof life and to become in the highest degree useful, they must develop\r\nits natural resources to the greatest possible degree.\r\n\r\nThe United States is particularly fortunate in its abundant riches of\r\nsoil, forest and mine, and in the fact that from the beginning of the\r\nnation these have been the inheritance not of a people slowly learning\r\nthe use of tools and materials, and emerging from ignorance and\r\nsavagery, but representing the most advanced and enlightened ideas and\r\nspiritual ideals of the time.\r\n\r\nThe result of these conditions has been inventions and discoveries that\r\nhave developed a great nation at home and have done much to better the\r\ncondition of the world. But the very magnitude of our natural wealth has\r\nmade us careless, even prodigal, in its use, and thoughtful men are\r\nbeginning to realize that with the natural increase of population which\r\nis to be expected, we shall, if the present rates of use and waste\r\ncontinue, find ourselves no longer rich, but facing poverty and even\r\nactual want. But it is not too late to save ourselves from the results\r\nof our past extravagance. We are only beginning to see the danger into\r\nwhich we have almost plunged, but we see enough to make us realize that\r\nevery one must do his part in checking the waste. Before this can be\r\nintelligently accomplished we must understand something of the great\r\nnational movement for the conservation of our national resources.\r\n\r\nLet us go back for a moment to the beginning of our history as a nation,\r\nthe days of Washington.\r\n\r\nInvention at that time was little advanced over what it had been three\r\nhundred years before. The same type of slow-sailing vessels carried all\r\nthe commerce. Wind and water were the only powers employed in running\r\nthe few factories. Only a little iron was used in this country, and in\r\nfact almost its only use anywhere at that time was for tools. There was\r\nlittle machinery, and that of the simplest description.\r\n\r\nAnthracite coal was known in this country only as a hard black rock.\r\nBituminous coal, gas, and oil were unknown.\r\n\r\nThe forests stretched away in unbroken miles of wilderness. The wood was\r\nused for the settlers' homes, their fuel, and their scanty furniture,\r\nbut they needed so little that it grew much faster than it could be\r\nused. The man who cut down a tree was a public benefactor. The trees,\r\nthough so necessary to life, were regarded as a serious hindrance to\r\ncivilization, for they must be cleared away before crops could be\r\nplanted.\r\n\r\nTo the pioneers as to us the soil was the most valuable of all\r\nresources. The rivers were necessary to every community for carrying\r\ntheir commerce, and turning the wheels of their saw and grist mills;\r\nwhile the fish, game, and birds made a necessary part of their living.\r\n\r\nUnder these conditions, with every resource to be found in such\r\nabundance that it seemed impossible it could ever be exhausted, and with\r\na small scattered population to draw on all these riches, careless\r\nhabits of using were sure to spring up. Our forefathers took the best\r\nthat the land offered, and that which was easiest to get, and gave no\r\nthought to caring for what remained. Their children, and the new\r\nimmigrants who came in such numbers, all practised the same wasteful\r\nmethods.\r\n\r\nIn the century and a quarter that has passed since then, a great change\r\nhas come over the world. By the magic of the railroad, the telegraph,\r\nand the telephone, all the nations of the earth are bound more closely\r\nto one another now than were the scattered communities of a single\r\ncounty in those days, or than the states of the Union before the Civil\r\nWar.\r\n\r\nThe forests have been cut away and in place of endless miles of\r\nwilderness there now stretch endless miles of fertile farms, yielding\r\nabundant harvests.\r\n\r\nSlow-going sailing vessels have given place to steamboats which now\r\ncarry the river and lake commerce. But men are no longer dependent on\r\nthe rivers, for swift railway trains penetrate every part of the\r\ncountry. The stage-coach is replaced by the trolley-car, and the\r\nhorseback rider, plodding over corduroy roads with his saddle-bags, is\r\nsucceeded by the automobile rider speeding over the most improved\r\nhighways.\r\n\r\nFarm machinery of all descriptions has revolutionized the old methods of\r\ndoing farm work. The fish, game, and birds are largely gone and in\r\ntheir place are the animal foods raised by man. Modern houses, filled\r\nwith countless devices for labor-saving and comfort, have replaced the\r\nsimple homes of colonial days.\r\n\r\nWhat has brought about this change? The energy and industry of American\r\nmen and women, aided for the most part by American inventions, and made\r\npossible by the wonderful natural resources of America.\r\n\r\nNo one could wish to have had our country's development checked in any\r\nway. These great results could be obtained only by using the materials\r\nthat could be had easiest and cheapest, even if it meant great waste in\r\nthe beginning. Labor was scarce and high in this country, abundant and\r\ncheap in Europe. In order to make goods that could be sold at prices\r\neven above those of European countries, it was absolutely necessary to\r\nhave cheap lumber, coal and iron.\r\n\r\nBut the time has come when we can no longer continue this waste without\r\ninterfering with future development. Some of the resources have been so\r\nexhausted that a few years will see the end of their use in large\r\ncommercial quantities. Others, such as coal and iron, will last much\r\nlonger, but when they are gone they can never be replaced; and so far as\r\nwe can now foresee, the country will cease to prosper when they can no\r\nlonger be had for use in manufacturing. The length of time they will\r\nlast at the present rate of use can be easily calculated. It is a long\r\ntime for us to look forward, for it is longer than the lifetime of any\r\nman now living, or of his children, but it is within the life of his\r\ngrandchildren, and that is a very short time in the history of a nation.\r\n\r\nIt may be said that while other nations have passed into decay, none has\r\never exhausted its resources so early in its history, and surely this\r\ngreat rich nation can not so soon face actual need. But we must remember\r\nthat no other nation has ever used its resources as we have used ours.\r\nWe are using in years what other nations have used in centuries.\r\n\r\nIt is not possible now, it probably never will be possible, to use every\r\nparticle of a resource. This would be too expensive, would mean a labor\r\ncost far beyond the value of the thing saved.\r\n\r\nIn the beginning, as we have shown, the vast wastes were not wanton, but\r\nabsolutely necessary, and we have not yet reached the point where we can\r\nafford to use the low-grade ores, to use all lumber waste and to\r\npractise many other economies that may sometime become necessary. But in\r\nthe case of the forests we should provide enough trees for use in coming\r\nyears, and in the case of all minerals, the refuse should be left in\r\nsuch condition that it can easily be ready for possible future use.\r\n\r\nIf conservation meant leaving our resources untouched, and checking\r\ndevelopment in order that there might be an abundance for future\r\ngenerations, it would be both an unwise and unacceptable policy; but it\r\nmust be thoroughly understood that this is not what is desired.\r\n\r\nConservation does not mean the locking up of our resources, nor a\r\nhindrance to real progress in any direction. _It means only wise,\r\ncareful use._\r\n\r\nIt does not mean that we shall cease to cut our timber, but it does mean\r\nthat we shall not waste two-thirds of all that is cut, as we are doing\r\nat present. It means, too, that we shall take better care of articles\r\nmanufactured from it, and most of all, it means that, when a tree is cut\r\ndown another shall, whenever possible, be planted in its stead to\r\nprovide for the needs of the future.\r\n\r\nIt means that we shall not allow the farms of our country to lose five\r\nhundred million dollars in value every year by letting the rich top-soil\r\ndrain off into our rivers, because we have cut away the trees whose\r\nroots held the soil in place. It also means that we shall not steadily\r\nrob the land of the elements that would produce good crops, and put\r\nnothing back into the soil.\r\n\r\nIt means that we shall not kill the birds that destroy harmful insects\r\nand thus invite the insects to destroy the crops that we have cultivated\r\nwith such care.\r\n\r\nIt does not mean that we shall let our mines of coal and iron lie\r\nunused, as the miser does his gold, but that we shall, while taking what\r\nwe need, leave as little waste in the mine as possible, and shall use\r\nwhat we take in the most economical way. This means a saving of money to\r\nthe user, as well as a conservation of resources. It means, too, that we\r\nshall not allow our water-power to remain unused, while we burn millions\r\nof tons of coal in doing the work that water-power would do better.\r\n\r\nIt means that we shall not allow enough natural gas to escape into the\r\nair every day to light all the large cities in the United States. It\r\nmeans that we shall take better care of the life and health of the\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nThis is the true conservation.\r\n\r\nIn the following chapters we shall take up each of the great resources\r\nin turn, shall see what we have used, what we have wasted, what remains\r\nto us, how long it will continue at the present rate, how it may be used\r\nmore wisely, and how it may be replaced, if that be possible, or what\r\nmay be used instead of those which can not be renewed.\r\n\r\nWe shall study how we may make the most of all that nature has given us\r\nand develop our country to the highest possible point, how we may rise\r\nfar above our present level in comfort, convenience, and abundance, and\r\nyet do all these things with much less waste than we now permit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nTHE SOIL\r\n\r\n\r\nThe soil is the greatest of our natural resources. We may almost say\r\nthat it is greater than all the others combined, for from it comes all\r\nof our food; a large part of it directly as plants which grow in the\r\nsoil and which we eat in the form of roots, leaves, grains, berries,\r\nfruits, and nuts; and a part of it indirectly as animals, which have\r\nreceived their food supply from the plants.\r\n\r\nBut this is not all. The soil supplies almost every known need. We build\r\nour homes from the trees of the forest; combined with the iron that\r\ncomes from the soil they furnish our fuel, our ships, our cars, our\r\nfurniture, and countless other things. Our clothing is made from the\r\ncotton or flax which grows from the soil, the wool from the sheep that\r\nfeed on the pastures, or from the silk-worms that feed on leaves.\r\n\r\nSo it is to the earth that we turn for every need, and Mother Nature\r\nsupplies it. But it is of the soil as it gives us our food supply that\r\nwe shall speak in this chapter, and we must first learn the nature of\r\nthe soil, and the process of its making, in order to understand the need\r\nof extraordinary care in its management, and also how to use it so that\r\nit will not wear out, or become exhausted, but will increase in value\r\nfor years and even centuries, as it will if properly cared for.\r\n\r\nThe earth's surface is constantly being renewed. Although the great\r\nformative movements occurred ages ago, yet earthquakes, volcanic action,\r\nwind, frost and water are working continual changes. Hills and mountains\r\nhave been thrown up, and nature has gone to work at once to shave down\r\nthe mountains and fill up the valleys. The whole earth is as carefully\r\nadjusted and balanced as the wheels of a watch, but these adjustments\r\ntake place in long periods of time. In a lifetime, or even a century,\r\nthe changes of the earth's surface seem few and small, but they are none\r\nthe less sure.\r\n\r\nThe soil or humus, that is, the upper layer of the earth's crust which\r\nis used in farming, has an average depth of about four feet, and has\r\nbeen formed by decay, first and most important of all by rock decay\r\nwhich is constantly going on under the surface of the earth and in\r\nexposed places everywhere, and is caused by the action of air and water.\r\nThis process is very slow. In places where the rock is already partly\r\nground up, or, disintegrated, as we sometimes say, it is more rapid, but\r\nthe average growth of the soil from beneath by rock decay is scarcely\r\nmore than a foot in ten thousand years.\r\n\r\nSome waste of this upper layer is constantly taking place from above,\r\ncaused by wind and floods, and considerable additions are made to it by\r\nthe decay of animal and vegetable matter, but in order to keep the soil\r\nat its best, the average soil waste should not amount to more than an\r\ninch every thousand years.\r\n\r\nWhen this humus is once exhausted there is no way to repair the damage\r\nbut to wait for the slow rock-decay. In the river valleys there is no\r\nimmediate danger of exhausting the entire body of the soil, but on the\r\nhills and in the higher regions the soil-depth is very much less than\r\nfour feet, and the danger of waste much more serious. There are parts of\r\nthe earth that were once almost as fertile as ours where great cities\r\nonce stood, but where now nothing is left but the bare rock.\r\n\r\nSo we know that the end is sure, even for the life of man upon earth,\r\nunless we learn to conserve our soil.\r\n\r\nThe value of our farm crops can not be overestimated. In food value they\r\nare the life of the nation; in money value, our greatest national\r\nwealth. For the year 1909 the total value of farm products was the\r\namazing sum of $8,760,000,000. It may give some idea of this vast amount\r\nto say that if we could have it in the form of twenty-dollar gold\r\npieces, stacked in one pile, the column would reach seven hundred miles\r\nhigh. If they were laid flat, edge to edge, they would extend from\r\nAlaska to the Panama Canal, with enough left over to reach from New York\r\nto San Francisco. If the money could be distributed, it would give us\r\nall, every man, woman and child in the United States, one hundred\r\ndollars apiece. The corn crop was worth $1,720,000,000; the cotton\r\n$850,000,000; wheat comes third with a value of $725,000,000; then come\r\nhay, oats, and other crops in vast amounts worth hundreds of millions of\r\ndollars. The cotton alone was worth more than the world's output of gold\r\nand silver combined. The corn would pay for the Panama Canal, for fifty\r\nbattleships, and for the irrigation projects in the West, with a hundred\r\nmillion dollars left over.\r\n\r\nAnd this is all new wealth. If we build a house, we have gained the\r\nhouse, but the trees of which we build it are gone. The same thing is\r\ntrue of every article we manufacture. Something is taken from our store\r\nin the making. But after we have taken these wonderful crops from our\r\nfarms the land is still there, and the soil is just as ready to produce\r\na good crop the next year, and the next, and the next, if we treat it\r\nproperly.\r\n\r\nThis matter of soil conservation is of the greatest importance to every\r\none of us. If you are to own a farm, or rent a farm, or till a garden,\r\nor plant an orchard ten years from now, it will make a great difference\r\nto you whether the man who owns it from now until then knows how to care\r\nfor it so as to make it produce well, or whether, by neglect, he allows\r\nit to become poorer each year. It will make a far greater difference if\r\ntwenty years elapse.\r\n\r\nIt makes a difference to the farmer whether he gets twelve bushels of\r\nwheat to the acre, or whether he gets twenty, for the cost of producing\r\nthe smaller amount is just as great as the cost of producing the larger,\r\nand the extra bushels are all profit. It makes a difference whether a\r\ngarden furnishes all the fruit and vegetables needed by the family, or\r\nwhether it does not even pay for cultivation, and the food must be\r\nbought at high prices. It makes even more difference to the dweller in\r\nthe city, who must buy all that he eats, whether food is abundant or\r\nnot. If food is abundant, prices are low, but when the yield is small\r\nthe demand is so great that prices become high.\r\n\r\nNot only the men, but the women and children as well, are affected by\r\nthese food values, because it is from the extra money left over after\r\nthe actual cost of living is taken out that the clothing, the\r\nhouse-furnishings, books, pictures, music, travel and all the pleasures\r\nof life must come.\r\n\r\nGreat as are our harvests, we are not raising much more than enough for\r\nour present needs. Each year we are using more of our food at home, and\r\nhave less to export to other countries. In a few years more the public\r\nlands will all be taken, and there will be comparatively little more\r\nland than we now cultivate to supply a population that will be many\r\ntimes as great as at present.\r\n\r\nMen who watch the great movements of the world tell us that the time is\r\ncoming before many years when there will not be food enough to supply\r\nall our people, when we shall be buying food from other countries\r\ninstead of selling to them, when we shall have famine instead of plenty\r\nunless we realize the danger and at once set about to make the most of\r\nevery acre of our land.\r\n\r\nJames J. Hill, the great railroad builder of the Northwest, and one of\r\nthe best informed men of the country on food production and the increase\r\nof population, is doing a great work in pointing out these dangers to\r\nthe people on every possible occasion.\r\n\r\nWatching the great food-producing region of the country, he has noted\r\nthat each year the yield per acre is growing less, and the population\r\nsteadily more. He tells us that when our first census was taken only\r\nfour per cent. of the people lived in cities, that fifty years ago\r\none-third of the people lived in cities, and two-thirds in the country,\r\nthat is, two-thirds of the people were furnishing food to the remainder.\r\nNow conditions are almost exactly reversed. Only one-third remain in the\r\ncountry, and must supply the food, not only for themselves, but for all\r\nthe two-thirds who are not food producers, so that the food supply is\r\nlagging far behind the demand. The price of corn has advanced from\r\ntwenty-five cents to sixty-five cents a bushel in ten years, and this in\r\nturn raises the price of live stock. And so all along the line. Prices\r\nare growing higher all the time because not enough food is being\r\nproduced to supply the demand.\r\n\r\nSo we can see that it is absolutely necessary that the soil be properly\r\ncared for if we are to continue to increase and prosper, for as\r\nSecretary Wilson has said, \"Upon the fertility of the soil depends the\r\nwhole business of agriculture.\"\r\n\r\nThe soil is exhausted in two ways: (1) By erosion, or the carrying away\r\nof the entire soil itself. (2) By so using the soil that one or more of\r\nits principal elements are worn out. We shall consider this form of soil\r\nexhaustion first, because it more directly concerns the work of every\r\nfarmer.\r\n\r\nBy a fertile soil is meant one that has an abundance of plant food in\r\nthe proper proportions. The soil contains all the elements that are\r\nneeded to support life, but they are in an inorganic form, that is, they\r\nare lifeless. Plants alone can take these inorganic substances from the\r\nsoil, and change them into starch, sugar, fats, and protein. All\r\nanimals, including man, must get these substances through plants, or\r\nthrough other animals that have already absorbed them from plants.\r\n\r\nThe soil contains ten elements that are absorbed or assimilated by\r\nplants. These are: (1) lime, (2) magnesia, (3) iron, (4) sulphur, all of\r\nwhich are found in most plants in very small proportions, and are\r\npresent in most soils in quantities far beyond the needs of crops for\r\nages to come; (5) carbon, which is obtained by plants through their\r\nleaves directly from the air and the sunshine; (6) hydrogen and (7)\r\noxygen, which are taken from the water in the soil and carried to the\r\nleaves, where they also help to take the carbon from the atmosphere.\r\nWith none of these elements, then, does the farmer need to concern\r\nhimself in regions where the water supply is abundant, as they are, and\r\nwill continue to be, plentifully supplied by nature. But the other\r\nthree, (8) nitrogen, (9) potassium, and (10) phosphorus, are needed by\r\nplants in large quantities, and are taken from the soil far more rapidly\r\nthan nature can replace them.\r\n\r\nAll these elements are necessary to plant life, but some plants require\r\na large amount of one element, others a small proportion of that, but a\r\nlarge amount of some of the others. No two varieties of plants require\r\nexactly the same proportions, so it is easy to see that the plant that\r\ntakes out of the soil any one element makes the soil less capable each\r\nyear of producing a good crop of the same kind.\r\n\r\nIn the early days of farming in this country, it was the custom to grow\r\na single crop, which had been found to give good results, year after\r\nyear in the same field. In Virginia and other near-by states nearly all\r\nthe best land was given every year to the cultivation of tobacco, which\r\nexhausts the soil rapidly. In the states farther north other crops were\r\nplanted in the same way. As a result, some of the most fertile soil in\r\nVirginia, the Carolinas, Massachusetts, and other eastern states has\r\nbeen so exhausted that it is no longer worth cultivating. Everywhere\r\nthroughout the New England states are to be found these worn-out farms,\r\nand, while they were never so fertile as the lands of the Mississippi\r\nValley, each one was rich enough to support a family in comfort, with\r\nsomething left to sell; but because they were required to produce the\r\nsame crops, and so take the same element from the soil, year after year,\r\nthey have become so lacking in one of the essential elements that they\r\nare unfit for cultivation, and have been abandoned.\r\n\r\nIt is wisdom and good business policy for farmers to study carefully\r\nthis question of plant food and to learn what each crop is taking from\r\nthe soil, so that it may be replaced. It has been found by long and\r\ncareful experiments, that when land has been \"single cropped,\" as this\r\nabuse of the land is called, for a long time, the soil has been almost\r\nentirely deprived of its nitrogen. As you know, nitrogen is one of the\r\nelements of the air, so that there is a never-ending supply, but most\r\nplants are unable to take it from the air, and until the last few years\r\nthe task of replacing nitrogen in the soil was considered impossible.\r\nRecent discoveries, however, have shown that there are two ways in which\r\nit may be done. By means of electricity, nitrogen may be directly\r\ncombined with the other elements of the soil. The other method is\r\nnature's own plan, and so is easier and cheaper. It has been found that\r\nwhile most plants exhaust the nitrogen from the soil, one class of\r\nplants, the legumes, of which beans, peas, clover, and alfalfa are the\r\nbest known, have the power of drawing large stores of nitrogen from the\r\nair, and, by means of bacteria attached to their roots, restoring it to\r\nthe ground.\r\n\r\nSo farmers have learned that if they plant corn one year, it is wiser\r\nnot to plant corn in the same field the next year, but to sow wheat,\r\nwhich requires less nitrogen, and the following year to sow clover, so\r\nthat the nitrogen which the corn and wheat have taken from the soil, may\r\nbe put back into it. If the land be naturally fertile, and has been well\r\ncared for, the soil is then ready to produce a good crop of corn again.\r\n\r\nIf the soil has become worn-out and the farmer is trying to improve its\r\ngeneral condition, he can gain better results by keeping the field in\r\nclover a second year, when a profitable crop of clover seed may be had\r\nfrom the land. This system of changing each year, and alternating cereal\r\ncrops, which take the nitrogen from the soil, with leguminous plants,\r\nwhich restore it to the soil again, is called \"rotation of crops,\" and\r\nif regularly followed will preserve a proper balance of nitrogen in the\r\nsoil.\r\n\r\nIn some parts of the West there is a lack of decaying vegetable matter\r\nin the soil, because the few plants which naturally grow there have\r\nsmall roots, and leave little vegetable material behind when they decay.\r\nFor this condition one of the best crops to employ in rotation is\r\nsugar-beets, because they strike many small roots deep into the earth.\r\nAs these decay, each leaves behind a tiny load of vegetable mold deep in\r\nthe earth, and also makes the soil more porous. As the principal\r\nelements of the soil needed by sugar-beets are carbon and oxygen, which\r\nare absorbed from the air and sunshine, and as the beets can be sold at\r\na good profit, it is an excellent crop to employ in rotation. In the\r\nUnited States records in various states show that where sugar-beets are\r\nused in rotation, the wheat and corn yield is increased from two to four\r\ntimes, and in Germany they are largely used to restore the fertility of\r\nthe land, even if the sugar-beets themselves are sold at a loss.\r\n\r\nIt is most important that farmers should understand the principle of\r\nrotation of crops, because nothing is taken from the soil so quickly or\r\nin such large quantities as nitrogen, and nothing is so easily put back;\r\nwhile, if it is not so replaced, the land becomes worthless.\r\n\r\nA comparison of the results of single cropping and the rotation of crops\r\nhas been clearly shown at the Experiment Station of the Agricultural\r\nCollege of the State of Minnesota, where for ten years they have planted\r\ncorn on one plot of ground. For the first five years it averaged a\r\nlittle more than twenty bushels per acre, and for the last five years,\r\neleven bushels.\r\n\r\nOn another plot, where corn was planted in rotation, the average yield\r\nwas more than forty-eight bushels, the difference in average in the two\r\nplots being thirty-two bushels, or twice the value of the entire average\r\nyield on the exhausted ground. The corn grown at the end of the ten\r\nyears was only about three feet high, the ears were small, and the\r\ngrains light in weight. But it cost just as much to cultivate the land\r\nthat produced it as it did to cultivate the land that produced\r\nforty-eight bushels.\r\n\r\nOf the other two elements, potassium is found abundantly in most soils.\r\nIt is also found in a readily soluble form in various parts of the\r\nUnited States and is sold at a very low price. But even if these\r\ndeposits were exhausted we could still use the rocks which are very rich\r\nin potassium, and are very abundant, in a pulverized form, or potash\r\ncould be manufactured from them.\r\n\r\nThe only remaining element of the soil is phosphorus. This element was\r\ndiscovered in 1607, the year of the first English settlement at\r\nJamestown and was first noticed because of its property of giving off\r\nlight from itself. The name which was given it means light-bearer. It\r\nwas at first thought to be the source of all power, to heal all\r\ndiseases, and to turn the common minerals into gold. Although we have\r\nlong ago learned that these ideas are absurd, yet we have also learned\r\nthat its real value to man is far greater than was even dreamed of then.\r\n\r\nIt is the most important element in every living thing, for no cell,\r\nhowever small, in either animal or vegetable organisms can grow or even\r\nlive without phosphorus. It is found in the green of the leaves, and\r\nhelps to make the starch. It enters largely into the grain and seeds of\r\nplants, and is necessary for their germination, or sprouting, as well as\r\ntheir growth. Three-fourths of all the phosphorus in a crop of cereals\r\nis in the grains, giving them size and weight. It will thus be seen how\r\nnecessary it is that the soil which feeds our plants, which in turn\r\nbecome the food of animals and of man, should contain a sufficient\r\namount of phosphorus.\r\n\r\nPhosphorus is taken from the soil in large quantities by every kind of\r\ncrop. In parts of Wisconsin which have been farmed a little more than\r\nfifty years without fertilizing, it is found that about one-third of the\r\nphosphorus has been taken out of the soil, which would mean that in one\r\nhundred and fifty years, or a hundred years from now, the soil would be\r\nincapable of producing any living thing, and long before that time the\r\ncrops would not pay for the labor of producing them. Almost every acre\r\nof land that has been farmed for ten years without fertilization is\r\ndeficient in phosphorus, that is, so much has been used that the soil\r\ncan no longer produce at its former rate.\r\n\r\nIt may be asked, if this be true, why the soil of America, which before\r\nit was cultivated had borne rich forests and fields of waving grass, has\r\nnot become exhausted long ago. We must remember that nature always\r\nadjusts itself; that, in the wild state, all plants decay where they\r\ngrow, and the same elements are returned again to the soil. But when the\r\nentire product of vast areas is removed year after year, the soil has\r\nnothing except the slow rock-decay with which to renew itself.\r\n\r\nIn tropical regions it is not necessary to feed domestic animals at any\r\nseason of the year, but in those countries where the natural food can be\r\nfound only during a part of the year, the need of artificial feeding is\r\nseen at once, and it becomes a part of the regular expense of farming.\r\n\r\nIt would be considered the height of folly for a man to allow his\r\nvaluable animals to starve to death because of the expense of feeding\r\nthem, but few people recognize the fact, which is also true, that it is\r\nequally bad business policy to allow the valuable crops of wheat, oats,\r\nand corn to starve for want of plant food.\r\n\r\nThe phosphates (that is, phosphorus) are the only large items of\r\nexpense, and in a large measure this may be lessened by raising live\r\nstock, for which high prices can be obtained either as meat or dairy\r\nproducts, and returning the manure, which contains a large amount of\r\nphosphate, to the soil. If all the waste animal products could be\r\nreturned to the land, Professor Van Hise says, three-fourths of the\r\nphosphorus would be replaced. All animal products are rich in\r\nphosphates. The packing houses manufacture large quantities from the\r\nbones and blood of animals.\r\n\r\nThe garbage of cities, when reduced to powder, yields large returns in\r\nphosphorus. It is said that if the sewage of cities, which in this\r\ncountry is often turned into rivers and streams, polluting them and\r\ncausing disease, was reduced to commercial fertilizer, it would supply\r\nthe equivalent of from six to nine pounds of rock phosphate per year for\r\nevery acre of cultivated land in the United States. And this valuable\r\nproduct is now totally lost, and worse than lost, since it menaces the\r\nlife and health of great numbers of our people.\r\n\r\nThere still remain to be considered the rock phosphates, the form in\r\nwhich phosphorus is found in separate deposits. The only large deposits\r\nthat have been used are in Florida, South Carolina, and Tennessee, and\r\nfrom them about two and a quarter million tons were mined in 1907.\r\nUnfortunately, however, there is no law that prevents its export from\r\nthis country, and almost half of this found its way to Europe, where it\r\nis eagerly sought at high prices.\r\n\r\nWithin a short time valuable phosphate beds, more extensive than any\r\nbefore known to exist in this country, have been discovered in Utah,\r\nWyoming, and Idaho. Professor Van Hise, who is one of the highest\r\nauthorities on the subject, says of these deposits that with the\r\nexception of our coal and iron lands, they are our most precious mineral\r\npossession; that every ounce should be saved for the time which is\r\ncoming when the population will have outgrown the capacity of the land,\r\nand means of increasing its fertility in order to prevent famine will be\r\nsought from every possible source.\r\n\r\nThe other great waste of the soil is by erosion, or the wearing away of\r\nthe soil by stream-flow. We can all see this in a small way by wandering\r\nalong the shore of any swift-running stream and noticing how the banks\r\nare worn away, and what deep gullies and ravines are cut into them by\r\nthe water running down from the fields above. Another way in which we\r\ncan observe the effect of this waste is by noticing the muddy yellow\r\ncolor of streams during floods and after heavy rains, and comparing it\r\nwith the clear blue of the same stream at ordinary times.\r\n\r\nWhen we realize that this muddy color always means that the water is\r\nfilled with soil, all that it will hold in solution, that it is carrying\r\naway the top soil, which is best for agriculture, and, finally, that\r\nevery little streamlet and creek, as well as the mightiest river, is\r\ncarrying this rich soil-deposit downward toward the sea in its flow, we\r\nbegin to see how great a factor erosion is in the wasting of the land.\r\n\r\nThe Missouri River, which drains a large area of wheat and corn land, is\r\nnotable as a muddy, yellow river at almost all seasons. Do you\r\nunderstand what that means? It means that this great productive region\r\nis growing poorer each year, and that as the population increases, and\r\nthe need of great harvests increases, the land is becoming less able to\r\nproduce them. The Mississippi River is said to tear down from its banks\r\nmore soil each year than is to be dredged from the Panama Canal. At the\r\nmouth of the river is a delta many miles in extent, formed wholly of\r\nland that has been carried down the river. The soil in lower Mississippi\r\nand Louisiana is almost black, and is in many places seventy feet in\r\ndepth, and it has all been left there by the river, which took it from\r\nthe higher lands.\r\n\r\nIt is estimated that our rivers carry out to sea one billion tons of our\r\nrichest soil each year. The ancient Egyptians worshiped the Nile because\r\neach year the spring floods left behind the rich soil deposits that\r\nfertilized their fields and gave them an abundant harvest. Entire fields\r\nand even whole farms along the upper stretches of the Mississippi and\r\nMissouri have been carried away, not the top soil only, but the land\r\nitself, by the swift current of the springtime floods as they cut a new\r\nchannel for the river.\r\n\r\nCanaan, the \"land of promise\" of the Bible, was once an abundant region,\r\n\"flowing with milk and honey\" in the language of Moses, with its grapes,\r\nits vast forests of cedar, fir, and oak, its treasures of wheat,\r\nolive-oil, and other rich agricultural products. Now all are gone. The\r\nentire country seen by the traveler in the Holy Land to-day is one of\r\nthe most desolate regions on the globe, where the few inhabitants are\r\nscarcely able to obtain a scanty living.\r\n\r\nWe wonder what has brought about this change, and we have not far to\r\nseek in answer to our questioning. The preservation of the forests means\r\nthe preservation of the soil, and the destruction of the forests means\r\nthe destruction of the soil. This is the universal law. First the\r\nforests were cut down and the hillsides left bare. Then the streams wore\r\ngreat ravines down the unprotected hillsides. Steadily the work of\r\ndestruction by erosion has gone on, until time beyond our possibility to\r\ncomprehend must pass before the land can be made productive again. The\r\nhills and valleys of China have been devastated in the same way, and\r\nmany of the older regions of the earth that were once the sites of great\r\ncities and extensive commerce are now marked only by the ruins of the\r\ncivilization that has passed away. They have almost ceased to support\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nIn the days of Rome's greatness, Sicily was known as \"the granary of\r\nRome\" because from this little island came the grains to supply her vast\r\narmies. 12,000,000 bushels of grain was the tribute that Rome claimed of\r\nSicily each year, and yet Sicily had enough left to make her rich. She\r\nbuilt splendid cities and became great. But the same story of\r\ndestruction is to be read in the history of Sicily. Now the entire\r\nisland does not raise a million and a half bushels of wheat altogether.\r\nThe soil is barren. The cities have nearly all fallen into ruin. The\r\npeople are scattered. Thousands have come to America, seeking a poor\r\nliving at the lowest wages because at home there was no chance to earn\r\neven the little they require. They allowed the soil to become exhausted\r\nby lack of fertilization and by erosion and it long ago ceased to\r\nsupport the people. All the rest followed naturally.\r\n\r\nIn many parts of our own country this same danger is coming on us. It is\r\nonly the beginning, but the end is as sure for us as for those far-off\r\nEastern countries.\r\n\r\nMillions of acres have already been destroyed in the East and South. The\r\nAppalachian mountain system lies not far from the coast, and the rivers\r\non the eastern slopes are short and swift. It is necessary, then, to\r\nexercise the greatest care of the forests in order to prevent the floods\r\nin this region from carrying away the lands in their swift rush to the\r\nsea. North Carolina was one of the richest states in the Union in\r\nnatural resources a hundred years ago. Now it is low on the list in\r\nagricultural products. The forests on its mountain tops were valuable\r\nfor their lumber, their turpentine, pitch, and other products, and great\r\nlumber companies have almost denuded the hillsides, regardless of the\r\nfate of the lands they cut over. The people of the state are powerless\r\nto prevent this except by buying all of these lands and replanting the\r\nforests. They have been pleading with Congress for power to stop the\r\ndestruction of their forests and the wasting of their lands, but so far\r\nhave received no assistance and meanwhile the land grows poorer each\r\nyear. The same conditions are to be found in many other states that now\r\nrank high agriculturally, but in North Carolina we are beginning to see\r\nresults.\r\n\r\nIn order to understand exactly how the damage is done to the land, let\r\nus suppose a case which has actually occurred in hundreds of places. A\r\nfarmer owned a farm on the mountain side. Much of it was good wheat\r\nland, but the top was covered with forests. At last he decided to cut\r\nand sell the timber, and use the land for raising more wheat. He did\r\nso, but now there was no spreading foliage to check the dash of the\r\nheavy rains as they fell to the ground. As they sank below the surface\r\nthere were no masses of tangled roots to hold the moisture in the soil\r\nand to carry it up into the air again through the trees.\r\n\r\nAs the water penetrated deeper, the soil became softened, and was\r\ncarried away down the hillside. It was only a muddy little stream, but\r\nit took away some of the richest soil from the fields, and the next\r\nyear's crop was not quite so good. Every rain that fell carried more of\r\nthe fertile soil down the hillside, and the next year the farmer\r\nwondered that the yield was still less. After a few years he ceased to\r\nsow the field because it had never paid for its cultivation, and was\r\nconstantly growing poorer. But it was too late then to repair the damage\r\nthat had been done. There were no seeds of forest trees left in the\r\nground and the farmer did not plant them, so the ground lay idle and\r\ndesolate. The rain wore deep gullies down the hillside, which, as they\r\ngrew larger, became more of a menace to the lands below them. The\r\nstreams soon grew large enough to take the top-soil from the fields\r\nlower down, and in a few years more the whole farm had grown so\r\nunproductive that the farmer, tired of the struggle, left the farm and\r\nwent to the city to make a living.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime the land in the valley below had been growing more\r\nfertile, for each year the spring floods had left a rich soil deposit\r\nbehind them. The farmer down there had been innocently stealing the land\r\nabove him, but not all of it, for much had been carried out to sea.\r\n\r\nIt is not possible to prevent this entirely, but much of the loss might\r\nhave been avoided by leaving the hilltops, which are never well fitted\r\nfor cultivation, covered with forests. In this way the soil-wash from\r\nabove is prevented and the streams run gently and with only a small\r\namount of muddy deposit, forming proper drainage for the soil.\r\n\r\nThe preserving of the forests on the great mountain ranges of the\r\ncountry, where nature has placed them, will mean in the one matter of\r\nsoil-wash, fruitful lands and bountiful harvests, instead of barren,\r\nwasted lands, desolated by floods and seamed by great ravines, carrying\r\ndesolation to the lands below them.\r\n\r\nBut in many cases the trees are already cut away. Here replanting\r\nbecomes necessary and should be done in every case where soil-wash is\r\nbeginning on the mountain tops. It is almost equally desirable to plant\r\nsmall shrubs and bushes as an undergrowth, so that the roots may form a\r\nthick mat below the ground to hold the water in the soil, and permit it\r\nto filter through slowly.\r\n\r\nIn Massachusetts, the tracks of the Boston and Albany Railroad are\r\ndepressed so that trains may pass below the level of the highways. In\r\norder to protect the banks from erosion, the sloping sides of this\r\nroadway have been planted with trailing rose-bushes and other vines\r\nwhich have thickly matted roots. These serve a double purpose in\r\npreventing landslides and washouts on the tracks, and in adding greatly\r\nto the attractiveness of the scenery along the railway.\r\n\r\nThe poorest land of a farm is always found on the hilltops, because even\r\nwith the greatest care there is always considerable waste of the\r\ntop-soil. This land, then, should never be used for field crops. It\r\nshould constitute the woodland, or if this is not possible, the\r\npasture-land of the farm, for the grass roots protect the soil and\r\nprevent it from washing away, and the profits on the hay are at least as\r\ngreat as any other crop which could be grown on hill land.\r\n\r\nBut when erosion has been checked and the top-soil preserved, when the\r\nsoil is thoroughly fertilized, and a proper rotation of crops\r\nestablished, there are still other lessons to be learned in order to\r\nmake our country as productive as it might be, as it will _need_ to be\r\nto support the population that we shall have by the end of the century.\r\n\r\nAs a nation we undertake to farm too much land and do it carelessly.\r\nThe invention of labor-saving machinery has made it possible to farm\r\nhundreds and even thousands of acres together with little physical\r\nlabor. This has made farmers heedless of small amounts of land wasted.\r\n\r\nA man often only expects to make a comfortable living on one hundred and\r\nsixty acres of land, while in Europe he would expect to grow rich on two\r\nor three acres. It is often said that a French family would live off of\r\nan American farmer's neglected fence-corners. In France, in England, in\r\nHolland and Belgium every bit of land is tended and made useful. We have\r\nthe best natural soil in the world, the most fertile river valleys,\r\nwatered by abundant rains. The fertility of our lands is the envy of the\r\ncivilized world, and has drawn thousands to our shores in the hope of\r\nfinding comfort and plenty, and yet the total value of our farm products\r\nwas only eleven dollars and thirty-eight cents per cultivated acre\r\naccording to the last census, while in the little island of Jersey, just\r\noff the English coast, the average annual value of products is over two\r\nhundred and fifty dollars per acre.\r\n\r\nGermany has been cultivated nearly eighteen hundred years, the soil is\r\nnot naturally so productive nor the climate so favorable as ours, but\r\nthe wheat yield there averages more than twice as much as in this\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nWhen the most fertile land in the world produces so much less than\r\npoorer lands elsewhere it plainly shows that we are robbing the soil in\r\norder to get the largest cash returns in the shortest possible time and\r\nwith the least possible labor.\r\n\r\nThe American farmer needs to cultivate a much smaller amount of land\r\nthoroughly, to have a soil analysis made of his land in order to know\r\nwhat crops are best suited to it and what elements are lacking to make\r\nit produce the best. In Illinois more than half a million acres had\r\nbecome unfit for cultivation. Analysis showed that the soil was too\r\nacid. By mixing limestone dust with the soil the trouble was corrected\r\nand the land reclaimed.\r\n\r\nOften it is only necessary to find the cause of some deficiency, or\r\nlack, in the soil, and the remedy will be found to be simple and cheap,\r\nwhile the result of its use will be to double the crop. Nothing else so\r\nquickly and easily responds to proper treatment, no other resource is so\r\neasily conserved. All the soil needs is proper treatment.\r\n\r\nEvery bit of waste land should be cultivated for either use or beauty,\r\nor both. If all the lanes and neglected places could be planted with\r\nfruit and nut trees, berry vines, and bushes, herbs or flowers which\r\nneed little cultivation after they are planted, our food, in variety and\r\nquantity, would be greatly increased. \"The hedge-rows of Old England\"\r\nare famous for their beauty and the air of comfort and prosperity they\r\ngive. They take the place of the weeds that grow by the country\r\nroadsides in America and which constitute one of the greatest nuisances\r\nof the farmer.\r\n\r\nAnother thing that should be considered is the marketing of farm\r\nproducts. Near a city or near a canning factory the soil can be most\r\nprofitably used for the raising of vegetables, for which the cost of\r\ncultivation is great, but which yield far larger profits than farm\r\ncrops.\r\n\r\nWithin the last few years a new system of farming has been developed in\r\nthe West, which is of great interest to all of us, both because it is\r\nopening up for production a large part of our country that has seemed\r\nvalueless, and because the lessons that have been learned there are of\r\nthe greatest advantage in every part of the country.\r\n\r\nWest of the one-hundredth meridian, which crosses North and South\r\nDakota, the western part of Nebraska, Kansas, Oklahoma, and Texas, and\r\nincluding the states west of them, lies a vast region that used to be\r\nknown as the \"great American desert.\" It comprises almost half of the\r\nUnited States. Here the noble forests of the eastern states and the\r\nprairie grasses of the plains were replaced by sage-brush and cactus.\r\nThe soil was light in color and weight, and the rainfall very scanty.\r\n\r\nIt seemed impossible that it could ever be fitted for agriculture. But\r\nthere were a few great rivers, rich mining districts, and excellent\r\ngrazing lands. These attracted settlers, and to them some cultivation of\r\nthe soil became almost a necessity. The waste waters of the rivers were\r\nused for irrigation and the land when watered was found to produce\r\nremarkably fine fruits and agricultural products. Yet there were\r\nhundreds of thousands of acres that could not be irrigated for lack of\r\nwater, and the problem of finding a use for these barren, semi-arid\r\nlands remained unsolved for many years.\r\n\r\nBut here and there in different states and under varying conditions,\r\nafter many experiments and failures, men began without water to grow\r\nsuccessful crops on these semi-arid lands, where the rainfall was\r\nscarcely more than ten inches per year. Others following this method\r\nfound success, and it began to seem possible that all this territory\r\nmight some day become a great farming region.\r\n\r\nBy comparing the methods employed in different states, the few general\r\nlaws have been worked out which must be applied in order to farm\r\nsuccessfully in this region, though the details differ with local\r\ndifferences in altitude, climate, soil, and rainfall. Here farming is\r\nbeing reduced to a science. In other parts of the country a man sows his\r\nseed and nature cares for it, and gives him his harvest; but here he\r\nmust wring from nature all that he gets, so it is only the man who farms\r\naccording to fixed laws who can hope to succeed.\r\n\r\nThis system is usually called \"dry farming,\" though \"scientific farming\"\r\nwould perhaps be a better name, for the same principles that are\r\nabsolutely necessary here will greatly increase the yield anywhere. The\r\nmost important principle is to conserve every particle of moisture in\r\nthe soil. It is necessary to go deep into the soil to find the\r\nunderlying moisture. The seed-bed is made very deep. Plowing is from\r\nsixteen to nineteen inches deep, while in well-watered regions it is\r\nonly about six inches. This deep seed-bed is thoroughly cultivated to\r\nmake the soil porous, the soil being reduced to a fine powder. After\r\nsowing the seed, the ground is packed as solidly as possible. This is\r\ndone by especially designed machines. The surface of the soil is kept\r\nbroken all the time to prevent the escape of the moisture. This rule\r\napplies equally to all soils in dry weather, and will often save a crop\r\nof corn in any part of the country during a drought.\r\n\r\nThese are simple rules, but the practice of them is opening up the great\r\nsemi-arid regions, not of the United States only, but of the whole\r\nearth. Western Canada, a large part of Australia, the Kalahari Desert of\r\nAfrica, and many parts of Asia, which are all semi-arid, will in time\r\nbecome productive instead of barren.\r\n\r\nIt must be remarked that the grains of the East could not\r\nwithstand the severe winters in a large part of the Northwest, so\r\nthe Department of Agriculture sent men all over the world to find\r\ndrought-and-cold-resisting grains. They found a hard winter wheat, the\r\nmost nutritious in existence, which is now growing all the way from the\r\nDakotas to the Pacific Ocean, producing crops far above the yield of the\r\neastern states. 50,000,000 bushels of this wheat was raised in 1907.\r\n\r\nThe soil is the natural disintegrated rock, rich in the mineral\r\nelements, but lacking in decayed vegetable matter. The crops soon\r\nexhaust the nitrogen, and as clover and the common alfalfas can not grow\r\nthere, the problem of finding legumes has been the most serious one\r\nfacing this new region; but in Siberia the Agricultural Department has\r\nrecently found a new clover and three varieties of alfalfa that will\r\nstand the cold, and Secretary Wilson believes that these will solve the\r\nproblem.\r\n\r\nEvery acre brought under cultivation adds to the world's food supply.\r\nCan we even dream of what it will mean when 200,000,000 acres are added\r\nto the farm lands of this continent? It means prosperity for the farmers\r\nthemselves, homes for those who are now crowded in cities, work for the\r\nidle, and food for the hungry. It means wealth and happiness for\r\nthousands now living and millions yet to come.\r\n\r\n\r\nREFERENCES\r\n\r\nLands. Report National Conservation Commission.\r\n\r\nSoil Wastage. Chamberlain.

The person who loves trees is a better person than the one who\r\ndoes not. As the poet expresses it:\r\n\r\n    \"Ah, bare must be the shadeless ways, and bleak the path must be,\r\n    Of him, who, having open eyes, has never learned do see,\r\n    And so has never learned to love the beauty of a tree.\r\n\r\n    \"Who loves a tree, he loves the life that springs in star and clod,\r\n    He loves the love that gilds the clouds, and greens the April sod,\r\n    He loves the wide Beneficence; his soul takes hold on God.\"\r\n\r\nTrees have played an important part in the history of our country: The\r\n\"Charter Oak,\" in the hollow of which the original charter of\r\nConnecticut remained hidden from the agents of the king; \"Eliot's Oak,\"\r\nunder which the gospel was first preached to the Indians; the\r\nwide-spreading elm under which William Penn signed his treaty of peace\r\nwith the Indians.\r\n\r\nBut no tree has held so dear a place in the hearts of the people, or\r\nbeen so watchfully cared for as the old \"Washington Elm\" still standing\r\nin Cambridge, Massachusetts. Under it Washington took command of the\r\ncontinental army. It is visited every year by hundreds of persons, who\r\nstand with uncovered heads beneath its spreading branches. Many years\r\nago it was struck by lightning and the upper part torn off, but all the\r\nbroken edges have been sealed with pitch to stop decay. It has been\r\ncovered with fine wire netting to prevent the bark being chipped off by\r\nrelic hunters. It is carefully guarded from damage by insects, and the\r\nboughs are stayed by strong wires.\r\n\r\nAnd so we might name many instances of trees that are loved and cared\r\nfor on account of their beauty, stateliness or some event connected with\r\nthem, but it is the usefulness of trees that we shall mention in this\r\nchapter.\r\n\r\nIn the larger use of forests is included their effect on climate and\r\nrainfall. It is generally believed that clouds, passing over the damp,\r\ncool air that rises from a forest, are more likely to be condensed into\r\nrain, and so we can establish the general rule that the country which is\r\nwell wooded will probably have a larger rainfall than the one which has\r\nfew trees.\r\n\r\nTwenty-five years ago Kansas was a prairie state with few trees, and the\r\nsemi-arid plains extended half-way across the state, but thousands of\r\nacres of trees have been planted, and crops have been cultivated, and\r\nthe more forests and crops the farmer plants the more rain comes to\r\nwater them. The great droughts which used to ruin their crops year after\r\nyear no longer disturb them. The hot winds which could undo a whole\r\nseason's hard work in a day are seldom heard of now. Kansas is no longer\r\nin the semi-arid region. It is one of the most productive states in the\r\nUnion, and this has come, not by dry-farming, but by the cultivation of\r\nthe soil and by the planting of trees.\r\n\r\nThough rainfall increases, destructive floods become fewer, for the\r\nhumus and the leaves on the ground in the forests hold the water as in\r\na vast sponge, and, as we have seen in the preceding chapter, they keep\r\nthe waters in check and distribute the rainfall gently and evenly on the\r\nlands below. They thus prevent erosion of the hillsides and balance the\r\nwater supply of rivers.\r\n\r\nTrees supply us with food and medicine, and greatest of all their direct\r\nuses, they furnish lumber for all kinds of manufacturing.\r\n\r\nWe can not think of life without the comforts and conveniences that we\r\nget from wood; but interior China affords a striking example of what it\r\nmeans for a nation to have a very small supply. There is no wood for\r\nmanufacturing and the natives search the hillsides for even the tiniest\r\nshrubs to burn and even for grass scratched from the soil. Once this\r\npart of China was a great forest region, but century by century the\r\nforests have been used, not rapidly, as in this country, for China is\r\nnot a great industrial nation, but surely, until there is hardly a twig\r\nleft.\r\n\r\nChina is not the only nation that has suffered in this way. Many of the\r\nancient peoples have entirely passed away; and the destruction of their\r\nforests, as we have seen in the previous chapter, was the first cause\r\nleading to their extinction.\r\n\r\nDenmark was originally almost covered with forests. These were cut down\r\nfor fuel, for lumber, and to make way for agriculture. For a long time\r\nthere was no attempt to restore them, and now a large area, once\r\nproductive, has become a sandy desert. In the same way, large parts of\r\nAustria and Italy have become valueless because the growing forests were\r\ncut down.\r\n\r\nIn France the forests at the head-waters of the Rhone and the Seine were\r\ncut down and fierce floods began to pour down the valleys each year,\r\nbringing destruction to property and crops all along their way. But\r\nFrance has long ago learned the lesson of forestry, and as soon as the\r\ndanger was seen, the mountain sides were replanted with trees, and since\r\nthen conditions have been gradually changing for the better.\r\n\r\nFrance has had another experience in forestry that has taught her what\r\ncan be done to save her waste lands. Near the coast were great\r\nsand-dunes. The winds drove them each year farther inland, and the sand\r\nwas gradually driving out the vineyards and farm crops. In 1793 the\r\nplanting of forests on these dunes was begun. Of 350,000 acres, 275,000\r\nhave been planted in valuable pine forests. More than half of these\r\nbelong to private owners and there is no record of their value, but the\r\nportion belonging to the government has yielded a large income above all\r\nexpenses, and is worth $10,000,000 as land; and this was not only\r\nvalueless but was a menace to the surrounding country. In the interior\r\nof France a sandy marsh covering 2,000,000 acres has been changed into a\r\nprofitable forest valued at $100,000,000.\r\n\r\nA hundred years ago all the eastern part of the United States and the\r\nRocky Mountains and the Pacific coast region were covered with thick\r\nforests hundreds and hundreds of miles in extent. Evergreens--the pines,\r\nhemlocks, cedars and spruces--grew near the coast in great abundance,\r\nwhile farther inland were found the most magnificent hardwood forests in\r\nthe world.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the first needs of the early settlers required them to\r\ncut down these mighty forests. The soil, which was very fertile, could\r\nnot, of course, be used for farming purposes until the land was cleared,\r\nand so this was the first necessity.\r\n\r\nThe wood was used to build the cabins, to make the rude furniture, the\r\nwagons and ox-carts, and for fuel, but this disposed of only a small\r\namount of the wood that came from the clearing of a farm. No man could\r\ngive it to his neighbor when all had more than they could use, and there\r\nwas no market for its sale. The trees were burned in large quantities to\r\nclear the land for the planting of crops.\r\n\r\nWood was of the greatest value to the first settlers, but it was also\r\nthe greatest hindrance to their making homes, so they took no care\r\nwhatever of what they could not use. It was burned or left on the\r\nground to decay. As towns sprang up, there began to be a demand for\r\nlumber for houses, for furniture, for vehicles and for fuel from those\r\nwho had no trees of their own. This made a market for the best grades of\r\nlumber at a low price, but almost every farmer would give away trees of\r\nthe best hardwood to any person who would cut and haul them away.\r\n\r\nConditions have changed very slowly, but very surely. In every state, in\r\nevery county and in every township there has been a steady clearing of\r\nthe land as it fills with new home-makers. At the same time the demand\r\nhas grown enormously each year from the dwellers in cities.\r\n\r\nThe opening up of railroads and telegraph lines in the middle and latter\r\npart of the century made a great demand for wood. The building of ships\r\nand steamboats, the opening of mines, the establishing of telephone and\r\ntrolley systems, the building of great cities, all these have called\r\nsteadily and increasingly for wood.\r\n\r\nThe time has long passed when wood was a hindrance to progress. For a\r\nlong time there has been a ready market at high prices and it is rapidly\r\nreaching the point where we shall face an actual shortage of timber.\r\nThis is not true of all parts of the country, of course. Maine,\r\nWashington, and parts of Oregon, Alabama, Arkansas, and Mississippi,\r\nWisconsin and some other states, still have vast quantities of lumber,\r\nbut trains and ships carry it to all parts of the world so there is no\r\nlack of a market.\r\n\r\nThe change from plenty, even great excess, to need, has come so\r\ngradually that few persons, even those living in the forest regions,\r\nhave realized until within a very few years how general is their\r\ndestruction. Those who, riding about a small portion of the country\r\nfamiliar to them, have been struck with the disappearance of the woods\r\nand the cultivation of the lands, have looked upon it wholly as a sign\r\nof progress, and have not realized that the same thing is going on in\r\nevery part of the country.\r\n\r\nThe wholesale destruction of the forests, without replanting, has come\r\nmostly from ignorance. We have had all our resources in such great\r\nabundance that we have not hitherto needed to learn the lessons that the\r\nOld World has learned, sometimes at the cost of whole nations, but the\r\ntime has come when we _do_ need to learn them.\r\n\r\nThe first lesson is to study the various uses of the forests, to find\r\nhow they are being affected by present use, their wastes, and the best\r\nmeans of preserving them. When all the people have learned these\r\nlessons, they will, undoubtedly, gladly set about righting the wrongs\r\nthat have been done in the past.\r\n\r\nThe original forests of this country covered an area of about\r\n850,000,000 acres, with nearly five and a half trillion board feet of\r\n\"merchantable,\" that is, salable, timber according to present standards.\r\n(A board foot is one foot long, one foot wide and one inch in\r\nthickness.) Considerably more than half the original number of acres are\r\nstill forested, but most of the land has been cut or burned over, some\r\nof it several times, and the amount remaining of salable timber, which\r\nincludes only the best part of the trunk, is from two to two and a half\r\ntrillion, that is from 1,400 to 2,000 billion, feet. The yearly cut for\r\nall purposes, including waste, is now over two hundred billion board\r\nfeet;--some authorities place the amount as high as two hundred and\r\nseventy-five billion feet. This, however, probably includes firewood,\r\none of the largest uses of wood, but taken very largely from worm-eaten\r\nwood that could not be cut into lumber. It also probably includes\r\nboughs, and other unsalable parts of the tree.\r\n\r\nThe timber cut doubled from 1880 to 1905, is still increasing at almost\r\nthe same rate, and, if we had the timber, it would doubtless double\r\nagain by 1930. But even at the present rate, the forests now standing,\r\nwithout allowance for growth, would be exhausted in from ten to sixteen\r\nyears. The yearly growth of timber in our present forests is estimated\r\nat from forty-two to sixty billion feet, and the yearly cut at from\r\nthree to three and a half times the amount added for growth.\r\n\r\nThat is, we are using in four months at least as much wood as will\r\nnaturally grow in a year. The other eight months we shall be using our\r\nforest reserves, and each year there will be less forest land to produce\r\nnew growth, as well as less old wood to cut.\r\n\r\nMr. R. A. Long, an expert lumberman who spoke before the first\r\nConservation Congress, estimated then that the forests, making allowance\r\nfor growth, would not last over thirty-five years. The government\r\nfigures indicate that they will last about thirty-three years, at the\r\npresent rate, but as the rate has been doubling every twenty-five years,\r\nmany persons who have studied the situation believe that the supply will\r\nnot continue in commercial quantities for manufacturing more than\r\ntwenty-five years.\r\n\r\nWe must understand, must think, what the destruction of our forests\r\nwould mean to us. It would mean fierce droughts and fiercer floods. It\r\nwould mean the gradual drying up of our streams, a scarcity of water to\r\ndrink, as in China to-day. It would mean that the manufacture of wooden\r\narticles would practically cease. The thousand conveniences that we\r\nenjoy as a matter of course would become rare and costly. It would mean\r\nthat only the rich could build houses of wood, and this would force the\r\nmasses of people into crowded quarters, not only the poor, but the\r\nwell-to-do also. These are only a few of the many disasters that would\r\nfollow the loss of our forests, and all these things might come to pass\r\nbefore we ourselves are old!\r\n\r\nIf we knew that at a certain time a tidal wave would engulf our homes,\r\nhow we should work to save all that we could before the calamity\r\novertook us! And we should set about the saving of our forests with\r\nequal care, for their destruction means distress for every one of us.\r\n\r\nFortunately, this is only the dark possibility. The methods of\r\nprevention are well known to those who have studied the history of the\r\nnations that have fallen, and the nations that have risen to power. It\r\nis only necessary that all the people should know these things and\r\nrealize their importance, in order to keep conditions as they are at\r\npresent or even to better them.\r\n\r\nThe methods of prevention are five. They are:\r\n\r\n(1) To use the trees in the most careful and conservative way without\r\nthe great wastes now common.\r\n\r\n(2) To save the vast areas of forests that are now burned each year.\r\n\r\n(3) To prevent loss from insects.\r\n\r\n(4) To use substitutes: that is, to use other and cheaper materials to\r\ntake the place of wood whenever possible.\r\n\r\n(5) To plant trees and to replant where old ones have been cut, until\r\nall land that is not fitted for agriculture is covered with forests.\r\n\r\nThese are only the rules that good sense and good business would teach\r\nus to follow, but we have not followed any of them in the past, and now\r\nit will be necessary to do all these things if we are to continue to\r\nhave enough wood to use to keep pace with our progress in other\r\ndirections.\r\n\r\nAs an example of the rapid rate at which we are consuming our forests,\r\nwe use nine times as much lumber for every man, woman and child as the\r\npeople of Germany use, and twenty-five times as much as the people of\r\nEngland use. This is due to several causes, many of which we would not\r\nwish changed.\r\n\r\nTo begin with, this was a new and undeveloped country, a large part of\r\nwhich had never been inhabited, and all the land, as fast as it was\r\noccupied, must be built up with entirely new homes; and because wood is\r\nthe cheapest building material it is the one generally used.\r\n\r\nThe growth of all European countries is mostly by the increase of their\r\nown people, while this is only a small percentage of our growth, which\r\ncomes largely from immigration from other countries, so the increase of\r\npopulation is much greater here and the proportion of new homes needed\r\nis far greater. Improvements of all kinds, public buildings, churches\r\nand bridges were built in almost every European community long ago,\r\nwhile in this country these things are being done each year in thousands\r\nof places.\r\n\r\nWages are higher in this country, and more people are able to afford the\r\nluxuries of life, vehicles, musical instruments, and the large variety\r\nof small conveniences to be found in almost every American home but seen\r\nin few homes of the poorer class in Europe.\r\n\r\nThese are a few of the reasons why we use such a large amount of lumber\r\neach year. They are all conditions that mean a larger, better nation\r\nthan we could otherwise have, with a higher standard of living, and\r\nwhile in some particulars, as we shall show, there should be changes\r\nthat would conserve our forests, the great wastes do not lie in the\r\n_use_, but in the _abuse_ of the forests.\r\n\r\nNow let us see what use is made of all the wood that is cut every year.\r\nThe greatest use of all is for firewood, but this is largely the\r\ndecaying or faulty trees from farmers' wood-lots, or the waste product\r\nof a lumber region, so this does not constitute so heavy a drain on the\r\nforests as the fact that 100,000,000 cords a year are used, would\r\nindicate.\r\n\r\nTwenty times as much of the salable timber is sawed into lumber as is\r\nused in any other way. Nearly 40,000,000,000 board feet are thus used,\r\nbut lumber is used in a variety of ways, while the other cuts are\r\nconfined to a single use.\r\n\r\nThe first and greatest use of lumber is for building purposes, for\r\nhouses, barns, sheds, out-buildings, fences, and for window-sashes,\r\ndoors and inside finishings of all buildings, even those made of other\r\nmaterials.\r\n\r\nNext comes furniture of all kinds,--chairs, tables, beds, and all other\r\nhouse, office, and school furniture; musical instruments, pianos, etc.,\r\nvehicles of all kinds,--farm wagons, delivery wagons, carriages and\r\nother pleasure vehicles, including parts of automobile bodies,\r\nagricultural implements, plows, harrows, harvesters, threshing machines\r\nand other farm implements. Though these are built largely of iron, yet\r\none-fourth of the implement factories report a use of 215,000,000 feet\r\nof lumber a year, so the entire output of these factories calls for a\r\nlarge amount of wood from our forests.\r\n\r\nCar building is the other really great use for lumber. Freight cars,\r\npassenger cars, and trolley cars use each year an increasingly large\r\nproportion of the product of our saw-mills.\r\n\r\nAfter these come the various smaller articles, which, though themselves\r\nsmall, are used in every home and are turned out in such vast quantities\r\nas to require a very large amount of lumber each year.\r\n\r\nAn empty spool seems a trifle, but the making of all the spools requires\r\nthe cutting of hundreds of acres of New England's best birch woods.\r\nButter dishes, fruit crates, baskets, wooden boxes of all kinds, tools\r\nand handles, kitchen utensils, toys and sporting goods, picture molding\r\nand frames, grille and fretwork, excelsior, clothes-pins, matches,\r\ntooth-picks,--all these are mowing down our forests by the thousands of\r\nacres.\r\n\r\nThe lumber cut includes all kinds of both hard and soft woods. A very\r\nlarge percentage of this is of yellow or southern hard pine, of which\r\nseveral billion feet a year are used.\r\n\r\nAn almost equal amount is used for hewn cross-ties for railroads and\r\ntrolley lines. Many sawed cross-ties are included in the item of lumber.\r\nThe hewed cross-ties are made from young oak-trees, or from hard-pine,\r\ncedar and chestnut. Without them no more railroad or trolley lines could\r\nbe built, and the present systems could not be kept in repair. Many\r\nother materials have been tried, but wood is the only one that has ever\r\nproved satisfactory and safe for this purpose.\r\n\r\nThe next largest use of lumber is the grinding of it into pulp to be\r\nused in making paper for our books, magazines and newspapers, wrapping\r\npapers, etc. The woods used for this purpose are mostly spruce and\r\nhemlock. The great sources of supply of pulp-wood are Maine and\r\nWisconsin, and large amounts are imported from Canada, which greatly\r\nlessens the drain on our own forests.\r\n\r\nNext in importance comes cooperage stock for the making of barrels. When\r\nwe consider the many uses of barrels,--that vinegar, oil, and liquors\r\nare all shipped in tight barrels, which are mostly made of the best\r\nwhite oak, and that flour, starch, sugar, crackers, fruits and\r\nvegetables, glassware, chemicals, and cement are shipped in what are\r\ncalled slack barrels, made of various hardwoods, the hoops being always\r\nof soft elm, a wood which is rapidly disappearing, we can see the size\r\nand necessity of this industry.\r\n\r\nRound mine timbers, largely made of young hardwood trees, are used to\r\nsupport the mines underground. Mining engineers say that on an average\r\nthree feet of lumber are used in mining every ton of coal taken out.\r\nAssuming that 450,000,000 tons of coal are mined each year, this would\r\nmean that almost a billion and a half feet a year are used in the coal\r\nmines, and this is about the amount shown by the government report.\r\n\r\nAfter this comes wood for lath used in building. This product is usually\r\ntaken from lower class wood or logging camp waste. Then comes the wood\r\nfor distillation into wood-alcohol for use in manufacture and to furnish\r\npower in engines.\r\n\r\nNext in quantity used comes veneer, which has two entirely different\r\nuses. The highest grade woods are cut to about one-twentieth of an inch\r\nand glued to cheaper woods as an outside finish in the making of\r\nfurniture. The other use is for veneer used alone, when a very thin wood\r\nis desired. This is employed for butter dishes, berry baskets, crates,\r\nboxes and barrels.\r\n\r\nNext on the list come poles--electric railway, electric light,\r\ntelegraph, and telephone poles. Every pole that is erected for any of\r\nthese purposes, every extension of the service, and all replacing caused\r\nby wind or decay, means the cutting of a tall, straight, perfect tree,\r\nusually cedar or chestnut. If we think of each pole of the network that\r\ncovers the entire continent, as a tree, we shall better realize what our\r\nforests have done in binding the nation together.\r\n\r\nLeather is stained by soaking the hides in a solution containing the\r\nbark of oak or hemlock. Sometimes an extract is made from chestnut\r\nwood. This has caused one of the most criminal wastes of trees, for a\r\ngreat deal of timber was cut down solely for the bark, and the wood left\r\nto decay in the forest. But now, as the price of lumber advances, more\r\nof it is used each year and less left to waste.\r\n\r\nThe bark and extract of the quebracho, a South American tree, are being\r\nimported for use in tanning, and are still further reducing the drain on\r\nour own forests.\r\n\r\nTurpentine and rosin do not in themselves destroy the forests any more\r\nthan does tapping the maple trees for their sap, but in the making of\r\nturpentine trees that are too small are often \"boxed\" and the trees are\r\neasily blown down by heavy winds or are attacked by insects and fungi.\r\nMany destructive fires also follow turpentining, so that on the whole\r\nthe turpentine industry is responsible for the destruction each year of\r\nlarge areas of the southern pine forests. The methods of turpentining\r\nintroduced by the government result in the saving of thirty per cent.\r\nmore turpentine, and also protect the trees so that they may be used\r\nfifteen or twenty years and still be almost as valuable as ever for\r\ntimber.\r\n\r\nTwenty millions of posts are cut each year in the Lake States alone, and\r\nthe entire number used is probably two or three times as great.\r\n\r\nThese constitute the greater uses of wood, not a full and detailed list;\r\nbut it plainly shows that all the uses are not only desirable, but\r\nnecessary for our comfort and happiness, and that we would not willingly\r\nsacrifice one of them, and in order that this shall not become\r\nnecessary, let us see what abuses we can find in the management of our\r\nforests. And here we find the most startling figures of all.\r\n\r\nGreat and important as is our list of products made from wood, we are\r\nsurprised to learn that of all wood cut fully two-thirds is wasted in\r\nthe forests, left to decay or burned. The largest forests are now all\r\nlocated far from the great manufacturing regions, and that means far\r\nfrom the lumber market. The cost of transportation must be added to\r\nevery car of lumber sold. The freight on a car-load of lumber from the\r\nSouth to Chicago or other points in the middle West is not less than a\r\nhundred dollars, and from the Pacific coast it is very much higher.\r\n\r\nIt does not pay to send low-grade lumber when the cost is so great, and\r\nas there is no local market a large part of each tree is burned. All the\r\nupper end of the trunk and all branches are thus destroyed, although\r\nmuch valuable timber is contained in them.\r\n\r\nAt one mill in Alabama a pile of waste wood and branches as high as a\r\ntwo-story house burns night and day throughout the year, and that is\r\nprobably true of all the larger mills.\r\n\r\nIf the timber could be conservatively managed as are live-stock\r\nproducts, so that all the waste could be utilized, all the small\r\narticles, shingles, lath, posts, tan-bark and extract, pulp-wood, wood\r\nfor distillation and small manufactured articles would be made\r\nby-products of the larger cuts.\r\n\r\nMuch has been said of the greed of large lumber companies in causing\r\nwholesale and reckless destruction of the forests, and much of it is\r\ndoubtless true, but the lumber companies cite the fact that no farmer\r\nwill gather a crop of corn which will not pay for the labor cost of\r\ngathering, and say that at the present prices of lumber they can not pay\r\nthe present freight rates to the factories. It seems therefore that a\r\ncertain amount of waste is unavoidable unless wood-working plants are\r\nestablished near the forest regions.\r\n\r\nThe first great step in conserving our forests is to stop the\r\nunnecessary wastes in use. The next step is to take measures to prevent\r\nthe great destruction of our forests by fire.\r\n\r\nThose who have never lived in a great forest region can have little idea\r\nof the extent of the damage caused by these great forest fires. The loss\r\nof life of both man and animals, the sweeping away of houses and crops,\r\nthe homelessness and misery of those who have lost everything they had\r\nsaved, are not to be taken into account here, but only the loss of the\r\nforests themselves.\r\n\r\nIt is estimated that the loss by fire is as great as the entire amount\r\ncut for use in the entire United States. The National Conservation\r\nCommittee reports that 50,000,000 acres of woodland are burned over\r\nyearly. This probably includes all burned-over lands, in much of which\r\nthe standing timber is not destroyed, but the saplings and seedlings are\r\nkilled as well as the grass for grazing and for the protection of the\r\nroots. Much land is burned over in this way year after year until hope\r\nof future growth is gone, though the damage to the large trees has not\r\nbeen great. In one way this loss is even more serious, as it shuts off\r\nthe hope of future forests, but the loss of our full-grown standing\r\nforests is grave.\r\n\r\nIn 1891 this loss amounted to 15,000,000 acres, or nearly forty thousand\r\nacres every day in the year. Since then the work of the Forest Service\r\nin fighting fires and the great clearing of the forests, has reduced\r\nthis somewhat, but it still amounts to no less than 30,000 acres of our\r\nbest salable timber a day. This is the really great and serious loss of\r\nthe forests.\r\n\r\nAll the wood that is used goes to make our country a better place to\r\nlive in, to make its people more comfortable and happy, but all that is\r\nlost by fire is a loss to all the nation in comforts for the future, and\r\nin the present it means high prices for lumber because our forests are\r\ndisappearing so rapidly.\r\n\r\nAnd we are letting them burn at the rate of thirty thousand acres every\r\nday! More than enough to supply all our needs. If any one could gather\r\ntogether in one vast pile our houses and barns, our furniture, our\r\nwagons and carriages, our farm implements, all our home conveniences,\r\nour railroad cross-ties, our trolley and telephone poles, our papers and\r\nmagazines, and burn them all, the whole world would be roused by the\r\nfearfulness of the loss. But we sit idly by and see the materials of\r\nwhich all these things are made and must be made in the future, and with\r\nthem our shade, our water-sheds, the soil of the forest-lands itself\r\ndestroyed, with never a word of protest.\r\n\r\nIn a paper prepared for the National Conservation Congress, it was\r\nstated that in some years government survey parties were unable to work\r\nin the Rocky Mountains for whole seasons on account of the dense smoke,\r\nand the fires were allowed to burn till the snows of winter put them\r\nout. The writer further stated that he believed from observation that\r\nthe Forest Service, by checking fires in their beginning, has in the\r\nlast few years saved more timber than has been used for commercial\r\npurposes.\r\n\r\nPrivate owners of large tracts should be compelled to use the same care\r\nin preventing fires that is exercised by the government. This care, and\r\nthe breaking up of the forests into smaller tracts by clearing the land\r\nin alternate sections would soon reduce the fire loss so greatly as\r\nalmost to save us from anxiety for the future of our timber lands.\r\n\r\nThe next great loss to the forests is from insects. When insects have\r\nbored into wood it becomes honey-combed by the canals cut by the little\r\ninsects and is utterly valueless. The loss to fruit and forest trees\r\nwill be taken up more fully in the chapter on insects. At present it is\r\nonly necessary, in order to show how much our forests suffer in this\r\nway, to state that the yearly loss from this cause is placed at no less\r\nthan $100,000,000 a year, and the loss to fruits is counted at one-fifth\r\nof the entire crop. Some slight idea of the danger to our forests will\r\nbe seen by the simple statement that forty-one different species of\r\ninsects infest the locust tree, eighty the elm, one hundred and five the\r\nbirch, one hundred and sixty-five the pine, one hundred and seventy the\r\nhickory, one hundred and eighty-six the willow, while oak trees are\r\nattacked by over five hundred!\r\n\r\nThis is exceedingly difficult to control and can perhaps never be\r\nentirely checked. Some remedies will be suggested later, and by having\r\nsmaller forests, more carefully watched, some personal care can be given\r\nto the trees. In Germany the trees are as closely watched as are other\r\ncrops, and the saving in value well repays this extra care and expense.\r\n\r\nA much smaller loss comes from the winds that sometimes level all the\r\ntrees over many square miles. This can not, of course, be prevented,\r\nexcept possibly in the turpentine forests, but care should be taken to\r\nuse all the wood, never allowing it to decay where it fell, and also to\r\nreplant the land with trees, unless it is fitted for agriculture.\r\n\r\nA great saving of the forests may be effected by what is called\r\npreservative treatment, which consists of treating railroad ties,\r\npiling, mine timbers, poles, and posts with creosote or zinc chlorid to\r\nprevent decay from the moisture of the ground or from injury by\r\nsalt-water borers. The use of creosote is almost double the cost of zinc\r\nchlorid, but it is much more effective and durable. A fence post can be\r\ntreated with creosote for about ten cents, a railroad tie for twenty\r\ncents, and a telephone pole for from seventy-five cents to a dollar. In\r\nevery case the timber treated will last twice as long as it would\r\nwithout such treatment and in view of the present high prices it is bad\r\nbusiness policy to use timber in such a way that it will need replacing\r\nsoon. It is estimated that if all timbers which could be profitably\r\ntreated were so cared for, it would mean a money saving to the owners of\r\n$47,000,000, and an annual saving in wood equal to 4,000,000,000 board\r\nfeet of lumber.\r\n\r\nThe next point in the conservation of the forests is to seek substitutes\r\nto take the place of wood. There are many uses of wood which nothing\r\nelse will satisfactorily supply. For example, no railroad cross-tie has\r\never been designed of other material that does not increase the danger\r\nof railway accidents, though over two hundred kinds have been patented.\r\n\r\nThere is nothing that will take the place of wood in furniture, and in\r\nmany small articles. Some articles might be replaced in metal, but it\r\nmakes them too heavy or too expensive. But in certain lines there is an\r\nexcellent opportunity to use other materials to great advantage.\r\n\r\nCars are now being built of steel, and of combinations of metal with\r\nasbestos. These are not yet entirely satisfactory, but it is hoped that\r\nthey can be perfected soon. Cement and concrete are taking the place of\r\nwood to a great extent in building, and their use will doubtless\r\nincrease rapidly.\r\n\r\nWhen veneer is used for barrels and boxes it affords a saving of nearly\r\ntwo-thirds in the amount of wood required. This is a line of use where\r\ncheaper substitutes should always be used if possible, because a package\r\nis usually used only once, never more than twice, and then discarded, so\r\nthat the wood is put to little real service compared with other wooden\r\narticles.\r\n\r\nWhen possible, small articles of wood should be made only in a forest\r\nregion or near saw-mills to use the scraps and save an unnecessary drain\r\non the more valuable grades of lumber.\r\n\r\nOne of the most important lines in which substitutes are practicable is\r\nin the making of paper and box-board or pasteboard. The latter is\r\nsometimes called strawboard, because it is made from wheat straw, and\r\nwhere it is manufactured, uses a large amount of straw that would\r\notherwise be wasted, but the great wheat fields of the West still have\r\nimmense quantities of unused straw, which, if made into strawboard,\r\nwould not only bring more prosperity to that region but would lessen the\r\ndrain on the forests.\r\n\r\nA box bound with wire and made of corrugated paper now takes the place\r\nfor many light articles of the wooden packing-case. The strawboard also\r\ntakes the place of wood-pulp for smaller paper boxes. Rice-straw, hemp,\r\nflax-straw, cotton fiber and peat have all been tested in a small way\r\nand found to make excellent paper, and it is thought corn-stalks can\r\nalso be used, but none of these is now manufactured in the United States\r\non a large scale. This is largely because the price of pulp-wood is low,\r\nand the cost of experimenting with new materials is great with the\r\nresults uncertain.\r\n\r\nThis brings us to the last one of our preventive measures for the\r\ndecline of our forests, the one which needs the most careful attention\r\nof all--the replanting of the lands that are not fitted for agriculture,\r\nand planting trees about houses and unoccupied spaces.\r\n\r\nMany farmers have planted orchards on a part of their farm-lands and\r\nmany trees have been planted in town and country, but until a few years\r\nago there was no organized effort to plant trees.\r\n\r\nNow many states have set apart a day which is called Arbor Day, for this\r\npurpose, but in no state does it hold so important a place as it should.\r\nIt is observed by the schools but not by the general public.\r\n\r\nIn Germany there are regular tree-planting days in which all the people\r\ntake part. Every one who is not too poor--and he must be poor\r\nindeed--plants a tree in his own garden, or in front of his home, in the\r\nforest or in the highway; for himself or for the general good.\r\n\r\nEach child plants a tree on his or her birthday every year, and watches\r\nand cares for it as it grows. The roadsides are lined with fruit or nut\r\nor flowering trees which have been planted in neat, orderly rows. These\r\nthings are in striking contrast to the observance of Arbor Day in this\r\ncountry, where one tree suffices for an entire school, or at best each\r\nclass has a tree of its own. It is all a matter of enthusiasm and\r\neducation.\r\n\r\nIn considering the best trees for planting we come to the last great use\r\nof trees of which we have not spoken. Fruit and nut trees supply us with\r\nlarge quantities of the most wholesome and delicious food. The apple,\r\npear, peach, plum, and cherry grow in the central part of the United\r\nStates, and oranges, lemons, figs, olives and apricots in the warmer\r\nparts.\r\n\r\nBy planting these trees in suitable places one may have a rich harvest\r\nfor many years to come. If a small fraction of the seeds of fruit trees\r\nwhich are wasted each year were planted, the general food supply would\r\nbe greatly increased, and many benefits would be derived from the trees\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\nHave you ever heard the story of \"Apple-seed John,\" the man who,\r\naccording to tradition, went through what is now western Pennsylvania,\r\nOhio and Indiana while the country was still a wilderness and planted\r\norchards for the settlers who, he was sure, would come later?\r\n\r\nSo many stories have been told of him that it is hard to discover how\r\nmuch of the tale is really true. At least one poem has been written\r\nabout him, and the Reverend Newell Dwight Hillis has woven the facts and\r\nfancies of his career into a charming book, _The Quest of John Chapman_.\r\n\r\nThe story is that he spent his winters in the settlements near the\r\nAtlantic coast teaching the children or working at small tasks about the\r\nfarms, and taking his pay always in the seeds of apples, peaches, pears,\r\nplums, and grapes. The farmers and their families saved all their seeds\r\nfor him and when spring came he filled his boat with seeds and started\r\ndown the Ohio River. When he reached a suitable landing-place he took\r\nhis bags of seeds on his back and trudged through the forest.\r\n\r\nWhenever he came to an open space he planted an orchard, built a fence\r\nof boughs about it, and started on again. And so he traveled on and on,\r\nthrough all the spring and summer months, year after year, planting his\r\nseeds for those who would come after him, until he grew too old to work.\r\n\r\nThe first settlers in those states found the orchards and vineyards\r\nawaiting them, and a few trees are still standing that are said to have\r\nbeen planted by Apple-Seed John. The story of this man who in his humble\r\nway devoted his life to others is one that may well be told and\r\nimitated, for while none of us can do the work he did, it may inspire\r\nus with a wish to make some spot on earth better by planting our few\r\nseeds or plants.\r\n\r\nIn carrying on this work in the schools as well as by the general\r\npublic, a regular plan should be followed. Much can be accomplished with\r\nno expense at all, even in cities. In all cases the expense will be very\r\nsmall compared to the good accomplished.\r\n\r\nSeeds may be planted and later transplanted. This will require no\r\nexpense and little labor. Every child, large and small, in city and\r\ncountry, can learn to do this work and can thus perform a real service.\r\nSmall saplings which are growing close together, where they can never\r\ndevelop, may each be planted in a place where it will have a chance to\r\ngrow into a thrifty tree. Most farmers would be entirely willing to\r\nallow the pupils to take such saplings from their wood-lots if the work\r\nwere properly done. This is an excellent work for country schools to\r\nundertake, both for the good it will accomplish and for the training of\r\nthe pupils themselves in practical work.\r\n\r\nFruit trees of suitable size for planting may be had for about twenty\r\ncents each. Most American children could easily save that amount from\r\nmoney spent on candy, sweetmeats or toys so as to have a tree ready for\r\nplanting on Arbor Day which would yield them fruit as they grow older,\r\nand be a source of pride and pleasure. Such trees will of course usually\r\nbe planted at the children's own homes, but it would be an excellent\r\nidea to follow the German plan of planting public orchards just outside\r\nthe town. When the trees are old enough to bear, the children are\r\nallowed on certain days to go and gather and eat the fruit and carry it\r\nhome in baskets.\r\n\r\nThe older boys in every school, whether city or country, should be\r\ntaught to plant and transplant trees in the best way. The following\r\ndirections for the work are sent out by the Department of Agriculture at\r\nWashington:\r\n\r\n\"The proper season for planting is not everywhere the same. When the\r\nplanting is done in the spring, the right time is when the frost is out\r\nof the ground and before budding begins.\r\n\r\n\"The day to plant is almost as important as the season. Sunny, windy\r\nweather is to be avoided. Cool, damp days are the best. Trees can not be\r\nthrust carelessly into a rough soil and then be expected to flourish.\r\nThey should be planted in properly worked soil, well enriched. If they\r\ncan not be planted immediately after they are taken up the first step is\r\nto prevent their roots drying out in the air. This may be done by piling\r\nfresh dirt deep about the roots or setting the roots in mud.\r\n\r\n\"In planting they should be placed from two to three inches deeper than\r\nthey stood originally. Fine soil should always be pressed firmly--not\r\nmade hard--about the roots, and two inches of dry soil at the top should\r\nbe left very loose to retain the moisture.\"\r\n\r\nThe reading of such poems as Lucy Larcom's \"He who plants a tree plants\r\na hope,\" or William Cullen Bryant's, \"Come, let us plant the apple\r\ntree,\" and suitable talks or papers on trees, dealing with their kinds\r\nand uses, on the benefits of forests, and on practical forestry, should\r\nbe a part of the Arbor Day exercises.\r\n\r\nIn many communities a tract of land which is not well suited for general\r\nagriculture may be obtained for the benefit of the school, and some\r\nsimple work in forestry may be undertaken by the pupils. Sometimes a\r\nfarmer may be induced to give a small bit of waste land where the\r\nexperiment may be tried. Sometimes such land can be bought by the school\r\nin one of the following ways:\r\n\r\nA series of entertainments may be given by the pupils, the proceeds to\r\nbe applied to the buying of the land, and the pupils may also obtain\r\nmoney in other outside ways to bring to the general fund. If only one\r\nacre can be bought and cleared by the pupils, and properly planted, a\r\nlittle at a time, a tree for each child's birthday, or by obtaining\r\nsmall seedlings and saplings from the forest, it will be a source of\r\nkeen interest, and will give an added pleasure to the school work.\r\nWatching the growth of the trees and caring for them will keep this\r\ninterest alive year after year, and in time it will become a valuable\r\nproperty belonging to the school. Sometimes the school officials will\r\nset aside a sum from the public money to purchase the land. In one High\r\nSchool, one acre is thus bought each year, and every pupil in the senior\r\nyear gives and plants a tree. Sometimes the farmers or the merchants of\r\na community may unite in buying the land, which will, of course, become\r\npublic property, and set it aside for improvement after the manner of a\r\ncity park.\r\n\r\nSometimes women's clubs become interested in such a movement and will\r\nraise the funds necessary for beginning it. It then becomes the duty of\r\nthe school, year after year, to plant and care for the land. After a\r\ntime the school will have a valuable property to sell, or can have a\r\nyearly income from the sale of timber.\r\n\r\nSuch plans may be carried out in many schools. Every school can and\r\nshould do something to forward this great work. All school yards should\r\nbe well planted and care taken that the boy with a new knife does not\r\ntry it on the bark or that the bark is not rubbed from the trees in\r\ncareless play. Many trees planted in school yards have been destroyed\r\nin this way.\r\n\r\nBut we shall not be safe if only the schools plant trees. Farmers and\r\nlot owners should take up the work in earnest, adding as many trees as\r\npossible each year. In this way they could insure an abundant supply of\r\nfruit, nuts and timber for the future, could increase the value of their\r\nproperty, and provide a steady income besides.\r\n\r\nFarmers' institutes would find this a most important work to undertake,\r\narranging for a common plan to be carried out in an entire neighborhood,\r\nand setting aside days in which all the members may work together to set\r\nout trees by the roadsides. This brings us to the question of what kinds\r\nof trees are best to plant.\r\n\r\nFor town or city lots, fruit trees should always be chosen, because they\r\nbear in a short time and will add to the family food supply, and so\r\nlessen the cost of living and increase the variety of food. Every farm\r\nshould have a good assortment of fruit. Any nurseryman's catalogue will\r\nfurnish lists of kinds so that a wise choice may be made. In selecting\r\nfruit trees, great care should be taken to choose the best varieties.\r\n\r\nFor streets and roadsides, nut or wild fruit trees are best, for the\r\ntrees are generally graceful in appearance and will yield some return,\r\nas the more popular maples and poplars will not. The chestnut is one of\r\nthe best trees for such planting, though it is of a rather slow growth.\r\nEnglish or American walnuts, pecans, mulberry and persimmon trees can be\r\ngrown in most parts of the United States.\r\n\r\nOne town in Kansas is planting fruit trees on all its streets, so that\r\nin a few years there will be an abundance of fruit free to every\r\npasser-by. This is a most excellent plan, but individuals would be\r\nlikely to find the fruit molested if only a few trees are planted in a\r\ncommunity.\r\n\r\nBarn-lots and lanes should be planted with wild cherry, haws, elder,\r\ndogwood, mountain-ash, and other wild fruits to serve as food for birds,\r\npoultry, and hogs.\r\n\r\nWhere the banks of streams need to be protected from erosion, probably\r\nthe best tree for planting is the basket willow, which thrives well near\r\nthe water, has a heavy network of roots, and is valuable for weaving\r\ninto baskets and furniture.\r\n\r\nFor all hillsides and rocky places, as well as wood-lots, the hardwoods\r\nwhich sell best for timber should be planted in the North and West, and\r\nthe evergreens near the sea-coasts and in the South. Forests of oak,\r\nhickory, walnut, maple (especially the sugar maple, which yields a\r\nsteady return during the lifetime of the tree), elm, chestnut, and\r\nlocust will sell for a good price, and are always salable. It requires\r\nmany years to grow large timber, but by proper management several years\r\ncan be gained in its growth, and it is always a valuable investment for\r\na farmer to make for his children.\r\n\r\nNot individuals only, but states and the national government as well,\r\nshould provide forests for the future, and this is the greatest duty of\r\nall, for much of the most important work can only be done by a power\r\nthat can control the entire watershed at the head-waters of a\r\nriver-system.\r\n\r\nFor example, the Appalachian Mountains are the source of hundreds of\r\nstreams which flow east, west and south, and pass through many states.\r\nThese mountains were originally covered with a heavy forest growth, but\r\nthey belong largely to private companies who are cutting the forests at\r\na rapid rate.\r\n\r\nThe effect of this is seen in bare hillsides, washed by mountain\r\ntorrents which are causing disastrous floods on the lowlands, filling up\r\nthe streams, and carrying away much of the most fertile soil of some of\r\nthe southeastern states, and in the drying up of the small tributaries.\r\n\r\nThis can not be remedied by single companies nor by the states that\r\nsuffer most. The only remedy is for the government to buy the land at\r\nthe head-waters of the rivers and reforest it. The same conditions on a\r\nsmaller scale are to be found in every mountainous region where the\r\nforests are cut away.\r\n\r\nThe United States owns a large amount of forest but not nearly enough to\r\ninsure a supply of wood for the future. The public forest lands are\r\nnearly all in the West. They consist of national forests, national\r\nparks, Indian and military reservations and land open to entry as timber\r\nclaims. In all they contain nearly 100,000,000 acres, or about half as\r\nmuch as is contained in farmers' wood-lots and about one-fourth as much\r\nas the amount owned by large lumber companies.\r\n\r\nThe United States, on its public domain, is setting about a careful\r\nsystem of cutting and replanting. This system is known as forestry. It\r\nhas been worked out by some of the more advanced nations of Europe who\r\nsaw that destruction was coming on them through the cutting away of\r\ntheir forests. Now forestry is practised by every nation except Turkey\r\nand China. The principles have been well proved and the results of\r\nscientific care of the forests are known to be even more sure than in\r\nfarming or live-stock raising.\r\n\r\nThe Department of Agriculture will send complete directions for planting\r\ntrees in rows at proper distances, will tell what kinds are best suited\r\nto each region and condition, how to make them grow rapidly, and when to\r\ncut. All these things should be thoroughly understood by every land\r\nowner, large or small, but at present forestry is practised on only one\r\nper cent. of all land in this country, owned by private persons or\r\ncompanies, though it is practised on seventy per cent. of all public\r\nlands.\r\n\r\nThe countries that show the best results in forestry are some of the\r\nGerman states, particularly Prussia and Saxony, and France. In Prussia\r\nthe rate of production is three times as great as it was seventy-five\r\nyears ago. There is three times as much saw timber in a tree as there\r\nwas at that time, and the money returns from an average acre of forest\r\nare now nearly ten times what they were sixty years ago. In Saxony the\r\nstate forests are receiving two dollars and thirty cents per acre a year\r\nabove all expenses from forests on land not fitted for agriculture, and\r\nthe profit is increasing every year.\r\n\r\nFrance and Germany together spend $11,000,000 a year on their public\r\nforests and receive from them an income of $30,000,000, or nearly three\r\ntimes as much, while the United States spends for its public forests\r\nmore than ten times as much as it receives.\r\n\r\nMany of our states are taking an active interest in forestry and are\r\nbuying tracts of land of low value for state forests. New York is taking\r\nthe lead in the work of planting forests, but even here the amount done\r\nis much less than it should be. The state forester says that one million\r\ntrees are planted each year while twenty millions should be planted.\r\n\r\nThe National Conservation Commission reported that the entire United\r\nStates should plant an area larger than the states of Pennsylvania,\r\nOhio, and West Virginia, in order to supply our future needs, but that\r\nwe have actually planted an area less than the state of Rhode Island.\r\n\r\nThis, then, is the lesson we should learn in regard to our forests: To\r\nguard against waste in cutting and use, fire, and insects, and to plant\r\ntrees until our future supply of timber is assured, till the head-waters\r\nof our streams are protected and our waste lands made into valuable\r\nforest tracts; till every farm has its wood-lot, and every community its\r\nfruit and shade. It is a work in which every one of us may take some\r\npart and from which good results are certain to come.\r\n\r\n\r\nORCHARDS\r\n\r\nAnother phase of tree-culture that does not, strictly speaking, come\r\nunder the head of forestry, but which should be considered here, is the\r\ncultivation of orchards, either for home use or for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nIn a few sections, fruit is the most valuable of all crops. Oranges in\r\nFlorida and California, peaches in some of the southern states, and\r\napples in the northwest, are more profitable than any field crops, and\r\ntheir cultivation is made the subject of careful scientific study. But\r\nthere are many other states where the raising of fruit in commercial\r\nquantities is almost altogether neglected, and to which almost all fruit\r\nis shipped from other sections. This is particularly true in the rich\r\ncorn and wheat producing states of the Mississippi Valley.\r\n\r\nThe early settlers each planted an orchard for home use, and these\r\nproduced the finest quality of fruit in abundance; but usually, after\r\nbeing planted, the trees were left to take care of themselves, while the\r\nfarmer's time and attention were given to his fields of grain.\r\n\r\nAs time passed, plant diseases and insect pests increased, winds broke\r\ndown many of the unpruned trees, frosts often blighted the entire crop\r\nof fruit, and the uncultivated, sod-choked trees produced fruit that was\r\nless in quantity and poorer in quality each year.\r\n\r\nIn recent years the highest grade of apples have all been shipped from\r\nthe West. These are grown on irrigated land; a high price being paid\r\nboth for the land itself and for the water-privilege, and the orchards\r\nare seldom more than ten acres in extent. Wind and frost may cause as\r\nmuch damage here as in the eastern states and plant diseases and insect\r\nenemies are equally liable to injure the crop.\r\n\r\nBut here orcharding is carried on in a scientific manner. The small size\r\nof the orchard makes it possible for the owner properly to care for\r\nevery tree, and each one must be made a source of profit. Every\r\ncondition that tends to affect the crop is carefully studied, and the\r\nremedy found and applied.\r\n\r\nThere is no reason why the same care and labor should not produce\r\nequally good results with far less expense in the well-watered regions\r\nof the eastern and central part of the United States. The neglected\r\norchard will prove a failure anywhere, as surely as will a neglected\r\ngarden, and success will come only by giving to fruit the same\r\nintelligent care that would be bestowed upon any other crop.\r\n\r\nThe cultivation of apples should receive particular attention in the\r\nnorth central states, because they have great food value, are not\r\nperishable, can be shipped long distances, and the demand, both at home\r\nand abroad, is always greater than the supply. The home orchard,\r\nhowever, should contain many kinds of fruit, and the same general rules\r\nin regard to the care of the orchard apply to all of them.\r\n\r\nFirst, the orchard should not be located on land that is fitted to\r\nproduce the best farm crops, but it must not be too steep and hilly to\r\nbe cultivated. A sunny sloping hillside is best suited to orchard crops.\r\n\r\nIn most cases little fertilization is needed except the planting of\r\nclover or some other leguminous crop. If corn be planted in young\r\norchards, as is often the case, potash should be used as a fertilizer\r\nafter the crop is gathered, since both corn and fruit trees draw very\r\nheavily on the potash in the soil.\r\n\r\nOld orchards sometimes need a single application of a general fertilizer\r\ncontaining all the principal soil elements. All fertilizers should be\r\napplied not merely around the base of the trunk, but as far from it as\r\nthe tree spreads its branches in all directions.\r\n\r\nThe trees should be carefully pruned and special attention paid to\r\ntrimming the tops low to prevent damage from winds, and also to make\r\nspraying easy.\r\n\r\nThe soil should be deeply cultivated the first few years in order to\r\nmake the roots strike deep into the ground, and afterward the soil\r\nshould receive some surface cultivation every year.\r\n\r\nWhen there is danger of frost after the trees have bloomed, brushwood\r\nfires are lighted and a dense smoke is raised over the orchard by\r\nburning pots of crude oil. This smoke is helpful in preventing the\r\nformation of frost, and will often be the means of saving the crop.\r\n\r\nThe other great causes of failure to grow large quantities of perfect\r\nfruit, if the varieties are well chosen, are plant diseases and damage\r\nby insects. The methods of their control are given in the chapter on\r\nInsects, and include principally the disposal of all decayed fruit, the\r\nraking up and burning of all leaves in infected orchards, arsenical and\r\nlime sprays, and, above all, such attention to pruning and cultivation\r\nas will keep the trees in good condition.\r\n\r\nLastly, the keeping of bees in the orchard will pay well, not only for\r\nthe honey they produce, but because they assist greatly in carrying the\r\npollen from flower to flower, and so increasing the crop of fruit.\r\n\r\n\r\nREFERENCES\r\n\r\nForests.

Water comes to us in the form of rain or snow. We\r\nusually think of it as unlimited, but we must come to think of it as a\r\nresource that can be abused and wasted or made useful and profitable as\r\nis the soil itself.\r\n\r\nThe amount of water is fixed and passes in an endless round from cloud\r\nto river or land and back to the clouds again. The average yearly\r\nrainfall of the United States is estimated at thirty inches, about forty\r\ninches in the eastern half, an average of eighteen inches in the western\r\npart, and in many places not more than ten or twelve inches. One inch of\r\nrain would amount to nearly one hundred and one tons per acre, or on a\r\nroof twenty feet long by twenty feet wide, one inch of rain would be two\r\nhundred and fifty gallons. With a rainfall of forty inches, this would\r\namount to 10,000 gallons in a year, or an average, over every bit of\r\nland twenty feet square, of twenty-seven gallons for every day in the\r\nyear. This is about the quantity that falls in the eastern part of the\r\nUnited States.\r\n\r\nIt varies slightly from year to year, but there is no more--there is no\r\npossible way of adding to it, though we may lessen it by allowing it to\r\nrush out to sea, giving no service to the land. As the land waters\r\ndiminish the rainfall also grows less.\r\n\r\nThis two hundred trillions cubic feet of water which falls on our land\r\nevery year constitutes our entire water resource, is the source of all\r\nour rivers and streams, of the moisture in the air, of our rains and\r\nsnows, and our water for plant and animal growth.\r\n\r\nTo understand how much this is, we may say that it is about equal to ten\r\ntimes the amount of water that flows through the Mississippi River\r\nsystem. The water of the Mississippi and its branches is nearly half of\r\nall the water in the United States that flows through waterways to the\r\nsea. This water that flows through our streams is sometimes called the\r\nrun-off. The run-off is increasing every year as we cut our forests and\r\ncultivate our land. It is used for navigation, irrigation and power, but\r\nthe increase is not an advantage for these purposes as might be\r\nsupposed, because it comes in disastrous floods, tearing away dams,\r\nruining power sites, and not only preventing navigation during the flood\r\nseason, but by filling up the rivers and changing the channels, making\r\nnavigation difficult and dangerous throughout the year. The run-off is\r\ncontrolled to some extent and may be brought under almost as complete\r\ncontrol as may be desired.\r\n\r\nAs much as the water of five or six Mississippis, or a little more than\r\nhalf of our supply, is evaporated to moisten and temper the air, to fall\r\nas rain or snow, or to form dews. This is sometimes called the fly-off,\r\nand except for some changes caused by management of the land, is\r\nentirely beyond control.\r\n\r\nA part of the remainder sinks into the soil below the surface. A large\r\nportion of this helps to cause the slow rock-decay that forms the soil,\r\nand which is known as ground water. It is estimated that within the\r\nfirst hundred feet below the surface of the earth there is a quantity of\r\nwater that has seeped down; and that would form, if it were collected, a\r\nvast reservoir sixteen or seventeen feet in depth spreading over all the\r\n3,000,000 square miles of the area of our country. This is equal to\r\nabout seven years' rainfall and is a very important part of our water\r\nresources. In many places it forms into underground streams or lakes. It\r\nfeeds all the springs and many of the lakes. Our wells are dug or\r\ndrilled into this underground water system. It carries away the excess\r\nof salts and mineral matter from the soil, the trees strike their roots\r\ndeep into the earth and draw from it, and last and most important of\r\nall, that which sinks immediately below the surface supplies all our\r\nplant growth. So that it is this last portion, that which sinks below\r\nthe ground, and which is sometimes termed the cut-off, amounting to\r\nabout one-tenth of all our water resource, or about the quantity that\r\nflows through the Mississippi River system, that forms the really\r\nimportant part.\r\n\r\nOn this depends all that makes a land habitable, the water for drinking\r\npurposes and for plant and animal growth. On it depends the rate of\r\nproduction of every acre of farm and forest land and the life of every\r\nanimal. Every full-grown man of one hundred and fifty pounds takes into\r\nhis system not less than a ton of water each year, and every bushel of\r\ncorn requires for its making fifteen or twenty tons of water.\r\n\r\nOf the importance of this Professor Chamberlain says: \"The key to the\r\nproblem of soil conservation lies in due control of the water that falls\r\non every acre. This water is an asset of great value. It should be\r\ncounted by every land owner as a possible value, saved if turned where\r\nit will do good, lost if permitted to run away, doubly lost if it also\r\ncarries away the soil and does destructive work below.\"\r\n\r\nThe uses of rainfall are given thus:\r\n\r\nA due portion should go through the soil to its bottom to promote rock\r\ndecay. Some of it should go into the underdrainage to carry away harmful\r\nmatter, another portion goes up to the surface carrying solutions needed\r\nby the plants. A portion goes into the plants to nourish them, and still\r\nanother part runs off the surface, carrying away the worn-out parts of\r\nthe soil.\r\n\r\nCrops can use to advantage all the rain that falls during the growing\r\nseason; and in most cases crops are all the better for all the water\r\nthat can be carried over from the winter. There are many local\r\nexceptions, but in general crops are best when the soil can be made to\r\nabsorb as much of the rainfall and snowfall as possible. This also\r\ncauses the least possible amount of wash from the land.\r\n\r\nDoctor N. J. McGee says: \"Scarcely anywhere in the United States is the\r\nrainfall excessive, that is, greater than is needed by growing plants,\r\nliving animals and men. Nearly everywhere it falls below this standard.\r\nIn the western part the average rainfall is only about eighteen inches;\r\nin the extreme eastern part the fall averages forty-eight inches. In the\r\nwestern part much of the land is unable to produce crops at all except\r\nwhen artificially watered. The eastern part might produce more abundant\r\ncrops, develop greater industries and support a larger population with a\r\nrainfall of sixty inches than it is able to do with a rainfall of\r\nforty-eight inches.\" As may readily be seen, the fly-off can be\r\ncontrolled only in a very small degree, by conserving the moisture that\r\nis in the soil, and so preventing it from evaporating too rapidly.\r\n\r\nThe cut-off can be controlled to a considerable extent through forestry\r\nand scientific farming and it is very important that the supply should\r\nbe as carefully conserved as possible.\r\n\r\nBut it is in the run-off that the great waste of water occurs, and also\r\nthat great saving is possible. It has been found by careful estimate\r\nthat from eighty-five per cent. to ninety-five per cent. of the water\r\nthat flows to the sea is wasted in freshets or destructive floods.\r\n\r\nWe are not accustomed to think of the water as wasted, since it seems\r\nbeyond our control, but as we are taking a careful account of stock, and\r\nseeing how our forests, our fuels and our minerals are disappearing, and\r\nour soil being carried out to sea by the rushing waters, it is well to\r\nconsider, also, whether this great resource may not be so used as to\r\nbenefit mankind in many ways and at the same time lessen the drain on\r\nother resources.\r\n\r\nThe water of streams may be divided as to use into four great classes.\r\nThe most important is that used by cities for general supply, for\r\nhousehold and drinking purposes; next, that which is used for navigation\r\nand the running of boats to carry commerce; third, that which is used\r\nfor artificial watering or irrigation, and lastly, that which is used\r\nfor power in manufacturing.\r\n\r\nIn the past, when water has been used it has seldom been employed for\r\nmore than one of these purposes, but as we come to understand more the\r\nnature, value and possibilities of this great resource, we shall learn\r\nto make the money spent for one of these lines of activity supply\r\nseveral other needs.\r\n\r\nAs we study each of these separately we shall see this interrelation\r\namong them.\r\n\r\nThe cities of the United States have expended $250,000,000 in waterworks\r\nand nearly as much more in land for reservoirs, and for canals for\r\nconveying the water from these reservoirs to the cities. The better\r\nmanaged systems protect the drained lands from erosion by planting\r\nforests or grass and the water is completely controlled, so that all the\r\nwater, even the storm overflow, is saved. There is very little waste in\r\nthese city water systems until it comes to the consumer, where, except\r\nwhen it is sold through meters, the waste is often great.\r\n\r\nThe failure to provide the greatest good lies in the fact that the\r\nwater systems have been used for water supply only and have not been\r\nmade profitable in other ways. The drainage basins should be heavily\r\nplanted with trees, which will in time yield a large return, or with\r\nhay, which can be marketed each year. Whenever possible, the canals\r\ncarrying the water supply should also be used to furnish power.\r\n\r\nThe city of Los Angeles, when it had a population of only 150,000,\r\nundertook to provide pure water from a point two hundred and fifty miles\r\ndistant. To do so it must take on itself a debt of $23,000,000, a large\r\nsum for a city ten times its size. Yet the people were ready to assume\r\nthis great burden to insure an unending supply of pure water, for they\r\nrealized that without it their city could not continue to grow. It was\r\nnot until the plans for piping water to the city were almost completed\r\nthat the value of the water-power along the route was realized. It has\r\nbeen disposed of at a rate that pays ten per cent. interest on the debt\r\neach year, and has made what seemed a dangerous risk, a profitable\r\nbusiness arrangement. All these other uses of water which are\r\nprofitable, help to lower the price of water to the users.\r\n\r\nThe matter of supreme importance in the water supply, however, is not\r\nwhether the water is cheap, but whether it is pure. If refuse from\r\nfactories is allowed to drain into a stream, the water becomes loaded\r\nwith poisonous chemicals, acids, or minerals. If city sewage or\r\nbarn-yards are allowed to drain into it, the germs of typhoid and other\r\nfevers enter the water supply. To insure the purity of water supply from\r\na stream, no factory waste, city sewage or country refuse should be\r\nallowed to enter any part of the stream. In addition to this it should\r\nbe carefully filtered.\r\n\r\nThe disposal of waste is a serious problem, and the easiest way is to\r\ndivert it into the nearest water course and trust to the old maxim,\r\n\"Running water purifies itself.\"\r\n\r\nThis, while true as a general fact, has so many exceptions that it is\r\nnot safe to trust to it. The Sanitary District Canal of Chicago has\r\nproved positively that even the most heavily germ-laden water becomes\r\npure by running many miles at a regulated speed through the open\r\ncountry, but the conditions are altogether different from those of an\r\nordinary river. First, in a river, sewage may enter at any point\r\ndown-stream to add to the germs already present in the water, while\r\nnothing is allowed to enter the Drainage Canal after it leaves the city.\r\nSecond, some germs live for several days and may be carried many miles.\r\nOnly a microscopic test can prove whether water contains such germs.\r\nUsually such tests are not made and water is used without people knowing\r\nwhether it is pure or not, but the water of the Sanitary Canal is tested\r\nat many points to determine its purity. Each hour and each mile of its\r\njourney it grows purer. This proves that although running water does\r\npurify itself, a stream that is drained into all along its course is not\r\na fit source of water supply.\r\n\r\nFactory refuse, instead of being allowed to pollute the waters, should\r\nbe turned to good use by extracting the chemicals, which form valuable\r\nby-products. All farm waste should be taken to a remote part of the\r\nfarm, placed in an open shed or vat with cement floor and screened from\r\nflies to form a compost heap for fertilizers for the farm. This will\r\namply repay the extra trouble and expense by increasing the farm crops.\r\nThe sooner such refuse, especially manure, is returned to the land, the\r\nmore valuable it is as a fertilizer.\r\n\r\nIn cities the sewage should be disposed of in such a way as to yield a\r\nprofit to the city, and also promote the health of the people. The\r\nsewage of a city of 100,000 people is supposed to be worth, in Germany,\r\nabout $900,000 a year for fertilizer on account of the phosphorus it\r\ncontains. The city of Berlin operates large sewage farms, using as\r\nlaborers men condemned to the workhouse. The expense for land and sewer\r\nsystem was $13,000,000, but it pays for the money invested, with $60,000\r\nyearly profit over all expenses.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand the cost of impure water to the city of Pittsburg was\r\nreckoned at $3,850,000, and in the city of Albany, New York, the annual\r\nloss was estimated at $475,000.\r\n\r\nIn the early settlement of our country all towns were built on streams,\r\nand the ones which grew and flourished were all on rivers large enough\r\nto carry commerce by boat. After the invention of steamboats, daily\r\npacket lines were run on all the principal rivers.\r\n\r\nAlbert Gallatin planned a complete system of improved waterways,\r\nincluding many canals, that was intended to establish a great commercial\r\nroute. Many canals were built and put into actual operation and dozens\r\nof others had been planned, when the building of railways began. This\r\nnew system of transportation at once became popular. Not only were no\r\nmore canals dug and no more steamboat lines built, but many of those\r\nactually in operation were abandoned.\r\n\r\nIn order to encourage railroad building and develop new regions, the\r\ngovernment has given land and money to the extent of hundreds of\r\nmillions of dollars, until now the railroads form one-seventh of all our\r\nnational wealth, having 228,000 miles of tracks and earning\r\n$2,500,000,000 each year, while the waterways owned by the government\r\nhave fallen into disuse.\r\n\r\nWithin the last four or five years another change has come about in the\r\ngeneral attitude toward the waterways. At the time that the crops are\r\nmoved in the fall, and when coal is needed for the winter supply, there\r\nare not nearly enough cars in the country to handle the volume of\r\nbusiness, neither are there enough locomotives to move the necessary\r\ncars, nor tracks, nor stations. In short, the railways are entirely\r\nunable to handle the vast products of the country during the busiest\r\nseasons. Many persons in the West have suffered for fuel, and commerce\r\nhas been greatly checked by the shortage; and the situation is growing\r\nworse each year as production increases.\r\n\r\nJames J. Hill estimates that the cost of equipping the railroads to\r\ncarry the commerce of the country would be from five to eight billion\r\ndollars. This means a heavy tax on iron and coal and timber as well as\r\non the labor resources of the country, and it would then be only a\r\nquestion of time until still further extensions were needed.\r\n\r\nWith these facts in view, interest in the waterways of the country has\r\nbeen revived.\r\n\r\nIt is estimated that it will require five hundred million dollars, or\r\nfifty million dollars a year for ten years completely to improve the\r\nwaterways of the country. This is not more than one-tenth of what would\r\nbe needed to equip the railroads. The cost of carrying freight by rail\r\nis from four to five times that of carrying it by water.\r\n\r\nMuch of the heavy freight of the country,--coal, iron, grain and\r\nlumber,--should be carried in this way, in order to reduce freight rates\r\nand so, indirectly, the cost to the people, and further to relieve the\r\nburden on the railways.\r\n\r\nThe railways, it might be added, would still have a large and increasing\r\npackage-freight business, besides the handling of heavy freight in parts\r\nof the country where there are no navigable rivers.\r\n\r\nFor these reasons it would seem clearly the only wise policy to adopt a\r\ngeneral plan for waterway improvement and carry it into effect at once.\r\nBut there are many things to be considered.\r\n\r\nMillions of dollars (in all about five hundred and fifty-two millions)\r\nhave been spent for the improvement of waterways. Some of it has\r\nresulted in great gain, but a large part of it has been wasted through\r\nlack of an organized plan. Work has been begun and not enough money\r\nappropriated to finish it. In the course of a few years much of the\r\nvalue of the work is destroyed by the action of the current or by\r\nshifting sands, or if a stretch of river is finished in the most\r\napproved manner, often it is not used much, in some cases actually less\r\nafter than before the work was begun, and these things have created a\r\nprejudice against waterway improvements.\r\n\r\nThe other reason is that in spite of the overcrowding of the railroads,\r\nthe traffic on many of our large rivers is steadily growing less. The\r\nInland Waterways Commission finds as a reason for the decrease, the\r\nrelations existing between the railways and the waterways. A railway,\r\nthey consider, has two classes of advantages. First, those that come\r\nfrom natural conditions. A railroad line can be built in any direction\r\nto any part of the country except the extremely mountainous parts, while\r\na river runs only in a single direction.\r\n\r\nIf a new region distant from a large water course is opened up, as is\r\nbeing done rapidly in the West through irrigation and dry farming, the\r\npeople are entirely dependent on the railways to develop it, to bring\r\nthem all the conveniences of the outside world, and to carry the\r\nproducts of their land to the market.\r\n\r\nBranch lines and switches can be built to factories and warehouses,\r\nwhile boats can reach only those situated along the water-front.\r\n\r\nAnother advantage of the railroads is that they bill freight all the way\r\nthrough, and that freight is much more easily transferred from one road\r\nto another. It is much more difficult and expensive to load and reload\r\nfreight from boats and barges on account of the high and low water\r\nstages of the river. This difference amounts to as much as sixty feet in\r\nthe Ohio River at Cincinnati. Railways make faster time, and the\r\ndistance between two points is usually shorter, though sometimes during\r\nthe busy season of the railways the river freight reaches its\r\ndestination much sooner.\r\n\r\nThe other class of reasons relates to the railways themselves, which\r\nhave always been in open competition with the waterways, and to gain\r\ntraffic for themselves, usually charge lower rates to those points to\r\nwhich boats also carry freight. In many cases they have bought the\r\nsteamboat lines so that rates might be kept up, and then, unable to\r\noperate the two lines as cheaply as one, have abandoned the steamboat\r\nlines.\r\n\r\nAnother method by which the railroads have driven out the water traffic,\r\nis by charging extremely heavy rates for freight hauled a short distance\r\nto or from boats, making it quite as cheap as well as more convenient to\r\nsend freight all the way by rail.\r\n\r\nLastly, railroad warehouses, terminals and machinery for handling\r\nfreight are all much better than those of inland steamboat lines, except\r\nat some points on the Great Lakes where the traffic is very heavy.\r\n\r\nSome of these disadvantages might be overcome by law. In France, where\r\nthe waterways are managed better than in any other country, the law\r\nrequires that railroad rates be twenty per cent. higher on all heavy\r\nfreight than the rates on the same freight if carried by water, and in\r\nseveral countries railroad companies are not permitted to own or manage\r\na steamboat line.\r\n\r\nThese measures are suggestive of what may be done by law to correct\r\nabuses, but laws alone can not accomplish everything. The rivers belong\r\nto all the people, and every one who wishes may operate steamboat or\r\nbarge lines, but before these can become profitable, and before first\r\nclass warehouses and machinery are installed, there must appear on the\r\npart of the people a desire to patronize them. The best results are\r\nfound in those cases where there is harmony between the railways and the\r\nsteamboat lines; those in which the steamboat lines relieve the railways\r\nof much of the heavy freight which they are not able to handle without\r\ngreatly increasing their present equipment.\r\n\r\nThere should be coöperation on the part of the people. The towns and\r\ncities along the banks of many European rivers provide suitable\r\nterminals, warehouses and wharves with free use of the service. In other\r\ncases this is done by private capital with a charge for use to shippers.\r\nSometimes it is done by the steamboat companies themselves, but unless\r\none or the other method is assured all along the river it is not wise\r\nfor the government to undertake the improvement of a stream.\r\n\r\nIntelligent improvement of the waterways of the United States demands\r\nfirst that a careful survey of the needs of the whole country be made,\r\nthen that a systematic plan be carried out providing for the improvement\r\nof important streams first.\r\n\r\nThe state and nation should work together, and any work that is begun\r\nshould be completed as promptly as possible so that its full benefit may\r\nbe realized.\r\n\r\nCertain work, such as the improvement of the channel, should be done by\r\nthe national government, since the waters belong to the nation; but the\r\nexpense of constructing levees or dykes should be borne by the land\r\nowners along the banks, because the land thus protected is greatly\r\nincreased in value; or by the state, which gets the return in increased\r\ntaxes.\r\n\r\nIn many instances, the improvement of a stream would be a great benefit\r\nto one state or part of a state, but it would be impossible in many\r\nyears to improve all the desirable streams, so that the larger ones of\r\nmost general importance must be considered first.\r\n\r\nIn such cases the improvement is often undertaken by the state. Some\r\nnavigable rivers have been thus improved and many canals are the\r\nproperty of states or of private companies.\r\n\r\nOnly a few rivers have a steady flow throughout the year at a depth\r\nsufficient to carry large boats. On most streams destructive floods at\r\ncertain seasons and low waters at others interfere with navigation\r\nduring a considerable part of the year. Most rivers have sand-bars,\r\nsunken rocks or logs in the channel, making the passage of boats\r\ndifficult and dangerous. Others are well suited for navigation, except\r\nat points where rapids and falls make it impossible for boats to pass.\r\nThe Ohio, the Tennessee, the Missouri and the upper Mississippi abound\r\nin such dangerous places and these should be canalized. It is the\r\nimproving of rivers in these ways, dredging harbors to make them safer,\r\nand digging canals to provide a short passage between two bodies of\r\nwater, that constitute what is known as the Improvement of Inland\r\nWaters.\r\n\r\nIf you look at a map showing the navigable streams of the United States\r\nyou will see that nearly all of them lie in the eastern part.\r\n\r\nThe Mississippi is like a great artery with branches extending in all\r\ndirections, east and west. The Great Lakes, with their outlet, the St.\r\nLawrence River, and the many important rivers emptying into the Atlantic\r\nOcean and the Gulf of Mexico, such as the Merrimac, Hudson, Delaware,\r\nSusquehanna, Potomac and Rio Grande, form great highways for all the\r\ncommerce of the eastern part of the country, while the Columbia,\r\nSacramento and Colorado Rivers, with their branches, are the only\r\nnavigable streams of any importance west of the Mississippi River\r\nsystem.\r\n\r\nIn some places a small portion of land divides two important water\r\nareas, and canals dug through this neck of land change the commercial\r\nroutes of the whole world. Such are the Isthmus of Suez, eighty-seven\r\nmiles wide, through which a canal was cut that saves a sailing distance\r\nof 3,700 miles from England to India. Only the Isthmus of Panama,\r\nforty-nine miles in width, divides the Atlantic from the Pacific Ocean.\r\nWhen the canal across this narrow strip is completed, the sailing\r\ndistance from New York to San Francisco will be shortened 8,000 miles,\r\nthe entire distance around South America.\r\n\r\nThe Sault Ste. Marie Canal, connecting Lakes Superior and Huron, is only\r\na little more than a mile and a half long, but it opens up the entire\r\niron, copper, lumber and wheat resources of the Northwest to cheap water\r\npassage through the other lakes to the manufacturing region of the East.\r\n\r\nThe Erie Canal, by connecting Lake Erie with the Hudson River from\r\nBuffalo to Albany, New York, makes the only water passage from the Great\r\nLakes to the ocean that lies within the borders of the United States.\r\n\r\nIf you will turn to the map again, you will see still other places where\r\na short canal may open up an entirely new and important water route.\r\nFrom Chicago to Lockport, Illinois, is only thirty-seven miles, but\r\nChicago is on Lake Michigan, while Lockport is on the Illinois River, a\r\nbranch of the Mississippi. This canal, a large part of which is now in\r\noperation, is a part of the Lakes to Gulf waterway. One plan is to\r\nbroaden and deepen the channel so that large vessels may pass, without\r\nunloading, from the Lakes to the Gulf of Mexico.\r\n\r\nAnother proposed canal which would be undertaken largely by individual\r\nstates and a part of which is already completed, would afford a safe\r\ninside passage connecting the many bays, channels and navigable rivers\r\nof the Atlantic coast.\r\n\r\nStill another proposed measure is the cutting of a canal from the\r\nsouthern end of Lake Michigan to the western end of Lake Erie at Toledo,\r\nOhio, to avoid the long haul up Lake Michigan and down Lake Huron again.\r\n\r\nThe United States now has 25,000 miles of navigable rivers and a nearly\r\nequal mileage of rivers not now navigable but which might be made\r\ncommercially important; five great lakes that have a combined length of\r\n1,410 miles, 2,120 miles of operated canals, and 2,500 miles of sounds,\r\nbays and bayous, that might be joined by tidewater canals easily\r\nconstructed, less than 1,000 miles long altogether, and making a\r\ncontinuous passage from New England to the Gulf of Mexico.\r\n\r\nIn all, our waterways at the present time are 55,000 to 60,000 miles\r\nlong, the greatest system in the world, but almost unused.\r\n\r\nThe most important waterway improvement so far completed, is the Sault\r\nSte. Marie, or the \"Soo\" canal which cost $96,000,000. A depth of eight\r\nfeet was increased to twenty-one feet. The traffic has risen in sixteen\r\nyears from a million and a quarter tons to forty-one and a quarter\r\nmillion tons.\r\n\r\nA large proportion of the United States is not naturally fitted to be\r\nthe home of man; at least, it is not fitted to produce his food, and\r\nexcept on the lofty mountains the reason for this will almost always be\r\nfound to be either a lack or an excess of water.\r\n\r\nIn some parts of the country, there is, as we have seen, little\r\nrainfall. These arid or semi-arid lands must be provided with water for\r\ndrinking purposes and for agriculture. The diverting of water courses\r\ninto canals and ditches so that water can be carried to these waste\r\nlands is called irrigation.\r\n\r\nIn other parts of the country where rains are abundant, serious floods\r\noccur every year, often many times in a year. Thousands of acres of\r\nland thus subject to overflow are lost to use. The holding back of these\r\nflood waters in the upper part of the rivers, and so preventing these\r\noverflows, is termed storage of waters.\r\n\r\nIn still other regions the rainfall is abundant, and the land low-lying.\r\nLarge areas are always covered with water. Such lands are called swamps\r\nor bogs, and when drained, they become the richest of agricultural\r\nlands. Irrigation, storage and drainage are the three methods employed\r\nto make waste lands valuable and useful. The land is saved or reclaimed,\r\nso all these methods of balancing and distributing the water supply are\r\ncalled reclamation.\r\n\r\nIn general it may be said that irrigation is more generally needed in\r\nthe West, storage of flood waters in the central and eastern states, and\r\ndrainage in the South.\r\n\r\nBy thus distributing the rainfall, hundreds of millions of acres have\r\nbeen or may be reclaimed, and large regions, formerly unfit to inhabit,\r\nhave been turned into profitable farms. Three-fourths of one per cent.\r\nof our total rainfall, or two per cent. of all that falls in the West,\r\nis used for irrigating 13,000,000 acres.\r\n\r\nThere are several methods of irrigation which are adapted to different\r\nregions and different crops. The rice fields of South Carolina,\r\nGeorgia, Louisiana and Texas are irrigated by allowing the land to\r\nremain continually flooded to a depth of several inches. When the\r\nirrigation season is over the levees are opened, and the water runs off\r\nrapidly, and the crop is soon ready to be harvested. Tidal rivers are\r\nused to supply water in most cases, but in Texas many flowing wells are\r\nemployed for irrigation.\r\n\r\nIn Florida, where irrigation is used largely for intensive farming,\r\nvarious means are employed, some of which are also used in the western\r\nand southwestern states. Mechanical pumps, operated by turbine wheels,\r\npump the water from the rivers if a lift be required. Sometimes the\r\nwater is pumped direct to the fields in iron pipes and applied by means\r\nof hydrants and hose, as in a city water system.\r\n\r\nOverhead pipe lines are now recognized as the most perfect and\r\nsatisfactory form of artificial watering. Two-inch pipes are run over\r\nframes several feet in height. These are arranged in parallel lines all\r\nover the fields about forty feet apart. At intervals of forty feet, a\r\nsmall iron pipe, ending with a fine spraying attachment, extends upward.\r\nThe water is turned on in the evening and comes out of the sprayer in a\r\nfine mist and falls upon the plants like a gentle rain.\r\n\r\nBy another form of irrigation, the fields are divided at regular\r\nintervals by wide wooden troughs from which water is directed between\r\nthe rows of plants. Main canals leading from the streams and intersected\r\nby short canals extend in all directions through the fields and\r\norchards, and are distributed in various ways. This system is in general\r\nuse throughout the arid portions of the West. The methods are said to be\r\nthe most scientific and varied in southern California.\r\n\r\nWhen water for irrigation is supplied from wells some underground system\r\nis generally used. One common method is to lay continuous pipes from the\r\nwells all over the fields and distribute from hydrants, plugs and\r\nstandpipes.\r\n\r\nBy still another system, the water is carried below the surface through\r\npipes which are broken every few inches and laid in beds of charcoal.\r\n\r\nIn the eastern states irrigation is only employed in dry weather to\r\nincrease the yield of vegetable crops. In the arid western region it\r\ntransforms what would otherwise be a dreary desert into fertile valleys.\r\n\r\nWilliam J. Bryan, speaking at the first Conservation Congress, said,\r\n\"Last September, I visited the southern part of Idaho and saw there a\r\ntract that has been recently reclaimed. I had been there before. I had\r\nlooked upon these lands as so barren that it seemed as if it were\r\nimpossible that they could ever be made useful.\r\n\r\n\"When I went back this time and found that in three years 1,700,000\r\nacres of land had been reclaimed, that where three years ago nothing but\r\nsage-brush grew, they are now raising seven tons of alfalfa to the acre,\r\nand more than a hundred bushels of oats; when I found that ten thousand\r\npeople are living on that tract, that in one town that has grown up in\r\nthat time there are more than 1,900 inhabitants, and in three banks they\r\nhad deposits of over half a million dollars, I had some realization of\r\nthe magic power of water when applied to these desert lands.\"\r\n\r\nThe same thing might be said of other regions throughout the West. In\r\nthe Salton district of California a marvelous change has been brought\r\nabout by irrigation. A few years ago that was one of the most desolate\r\nand forbidding regions on our continent. Now it is covered with several\r\nthousands of acres of alfalfa and other crops, and it bids fair to be a\r\ngreat fruit region. Of southern California it is said, \"The irrigation\r\nsystems of this part of the state are known all over the world, and have\r\ncreated a prosperous commonwealth in a region which would be a scene of\r\nutter desolation without them.\"\r\n\r\nThis locality presents a better opportunity for the scientific study of\r\nfarming by irrigation than exists anywhere else in the world. Here all\r\nland values depend directly on ability to obtain a water supply. So\r\nprecious is the water and so abundant are the rewards that follow its\r\napplication to the soil that the most careful consideration is given to\r\nthe various sources of supply and distribution.\r\n\r\nAs land becomes scarcer and the cost of living greater on account of the\r\nincrease in population, men are turning more and more to irrigation to\r\nsolve the problem of food supply.\r\n\r\nAs showing what may be accomplished by irrigation, the report of the\r\nlast census says: \"The construction of large irrigation works on the\r\nPlatte, Yellowstone and Arkansas Rivers would render fertile an area\r\nequal to that of some eastern states. Engineers are grappling with the\r\ngreat problems of conserving the flood waters of these streams, which\r\nnow are wasted and help to increase the destructive floods of the\r\nMississippi. The solving of these problems will change a vast area of\r\ncountry, now practically worthless, into valuable farms.\"\r\n\r\nThe \"Great Bend\" country, drained by the Columbia River, contains\r\nseveral million acres of land which only requires water to make it of\r\ngreat agricultural value.\r\n\r\nThe Gila River basin contains more than 10,000,000 acres of fertile\r\nland, capable of producing immense crops if irrigated, but without\r\nirrigation it is a desert land where only sage-brush and cactus\r\nflourish.\r\n\r\nFrom arid lands capable of producing excellent crops but lacking in the\r\nmagical element of water, we pass to the consideration of lands where\r\nthe richest of soils are shut off from productiveness because they are\r\ncovered with water. On the lower Mississippi the soil is richer than in\r\nany other part of the United States, but much of it is overflowed so\r\nfrequently that it is unfit for cultivation. Dykes and levees have\r\nreclaimed thousands of acres of such overflow land. Many states control\r\nlarge marshy sections that have been or may be reclaimed.\r\n\r\nIn southern Florida lie the Everglades, a vast country which has been\r\nworse than valueless; a malarial region abounding in alligators,\r\nrattlesnakes, scorpions and other dangerous animals and insects. The\r\nstate of Florida has undertaken the work of draining this great swamp,\r\nand when the task is completed, Florida will have added to its resources\r\n3,000,000 acres of the richest soil for the raising of winter vegetables\r\nand fruits.\r\n\r\nFlorida is engaged in another great project--the digging of an inside\r\npassage connecting its inland tidal waters by a canal system which will\r\nopen to navigation a continuous inland waterway six hundred miles in\r\nlength. In digging these canals through the marshes bordering the\r\ncoast, thousands of acres of exceedingly fertile land have been\r\nreclaimed and are now producing valuable crops.\r\n\r\nThe Kankakee marshes in Indiana have been drained, adding many thousands\r\nof acres of rich soil to the agricultural area of the state.\r\n\r\nIn all, about 80,000,000 acres are so wet that they must be drained in\r\norder to make them produce good farm crops, but which, while now covered\r\nonly with marsh grass or undergrowth, is capable of being made the most\r\nfertile of all land.\r\n\r\nThis swamp land is ten times the area of Holland, which supports a\r\npopulation of 5,000,000 people. It is therefore easy to see how greatly\r\nwe may add to our productive territory and our national wealth by\r\nreclamation through drainage.\r\n\r\nWe now come to the use of water as power; and although in the last fifty\r\nyears this subject has received little attention, as manufacturing\r\nincreases and as fuel decreases and becomes higher, the value of water\r\nbecomes more evident, and water-power sites are being eagerly sought.\r\n\r\nOur age may come to be known in the future as the age of power, because\r\nthrough the application of mechanical power man has gained such\r\nmarvelous control over the world about him. Wind and water led in the\r\nproduction of power until about 1870, since which time they have\r\nscarcely increased at all, the greater advantages of steam and\r\nelectricity having driven them out.\r\n\r\nAs long as all factories had to be built by the side of streams having\r\nsuitable water-power, the number and size of factories were always\r\nextremely limited. With the introduction of steam it became possible to\r\nbuild factories at mines, in forests, in fruit or grain regions,\r\nwherever the supply of raw material was plentiful, and to multiply\r\nfactories of all kinds in cities near the markets for their product, or\r\nwhere labor was cheap and abundant. But power could only be used where\r\nit was developed, and the size of the power plant depended on the amount\r\nof business done by each individual user.\r\n\r\nNow a new era of power has again enlarged the possibilities of\r\nmanufacturing. By means of electricity the work, not only of factories,\r\nbut also of the home and the farm may be done in any place where\r\nelectricity can be installed. We must bear in mind that electricity is\r\nnever a source of power, but is only the agent that carries power to the\r\nuser. The source of all electric power is either steam or water,\r\nproduced by water-wheels, turbines, steam-engines or gas-engines. The\r\neconomical way to furnish electric power is to establish central power\r\nplants, and electricity may be conveyed from them for many miles. An\r\nelectric railway, telegraph, or telephone system many miles in length\r\nis operated from a single power plant. Electric light and power are\r\ntransmitted all over the largest cities. It is no longer necessary that\r\na factory be of any specified size nor that it have any waste power. If\r\nit be within reach of the electrical current it may use as much or as\r\nlittle as is needed.\r\n\r\nThe cheapness of electric power must always depend on nearness to the\r\nsource of supply or to the market. Until a short time ago it was\r\ncustomary to locate electric power-houses near the market, that is, in\r\ncities. But the benefits to be derived from having the electric plant\r\nnear the source of power, so that the cost of production is greatly\r\nlessened, are becoming better recognized. This will make water-power\r\nincreasingly valuable.\r\n\r\nIt is even now practicable to develop water-power, wherever located, for\r\nthe production of electricity. Although the lowest grade coals are used\r\nfor electric power at the mines yet they can now be used for still other\r\npurposes. Coal or other fuel once used can not be replaced, but when\r\nelectricity is derived from water-power only energy otherwise wasted is\r\nused. This energy, if derived from water-power, is all added to our\r\nassets instead of being lost.\r\n\r\nFor many years the amount of power used for manufacturing and other\r\npurposes has doubled about once in ten years, and the steady pace kept\r\nby different lines of development shows how closely they are related.\r\nOur power, our forest cut, the use of our iron and other minerals, our\r\ncoal and petroleum, the railroad earnings, freight and passenger\r\ntraffic, and our agricultural products all double themselves every ten\r\nyears. This means that in ten years we shall require twice as much power\r\nas now, but will have far less coal to use. This raises the\r\nquestion,--have we available water-power to conserve our coal supply?\r\nLet us see. It is estimated that we are now using 26,000,000 horse-power\r\nof energy derived from steam, 3,000,000 horse-power derived from water,\r\nand 800,000 from gas or oil, a total of 29,800,000 horse-power. It is\r\nalso estimated that there is now running idly over dams, falls, and\r\nrapids 30,000,000 horse-power of energy. In other words, we are wasting\r\nevery day enough water to run every factory and mill, and to turn every\r\nwheel, to move every electric car and to supply every electric light or\r\npower-station in the country.\r\n\r\nThe amount of water-power is gauged solely by the low-water stage of the\r\nstream. A river is considered to produce only as much power as it can\r\nfurnish at its season of lowest water. At other times factories may be\r\noperated more actively, but usually most of the extra power is wasted\r\nduring a large part of the year.\r\n\r\nIf these storm or flood waters can be stored in reservoirs, the\r\nstream-flow throughout the year can be made fairly uniform and the power\r\npossibilities greatly increased. The Geological Survey believes that by\r\nstoring the flood waters and regulating the flow of the streams, the\r\nlarge rivers of the United States may be made to furnish 150,000,000\r\nhorse-power, enough, if it could be utilized, to supply every power need\r\nof our country for many years to come without using a ton of our coal,\r\nand without in any way decreasing the water.\r\n\r\nOf course this can never be practicable. Much power will always be\r\nneeded where no stream for power is available. But the lesson is plain\r\nthat where water can be used it should be, both in order to save the\r\ncoal and because it can be produced more cheaply. The 30,000,000\r\nhorse-power now available, if produced in our most modern electric\r\nplants, would require the burning of nearly 225,000,000 tons of coal,\r\nand if in the average plant run by steam-engines, more than 650,000,000\r\ntons of coal, which is fifty per cent. more than all the coal that is\r\nnow produced in this country. At three dollars per ton it would cost\r\n$2,000,000,000 a year to supply the coal to furnish the power that we\r\nmight have, one might almost say, as a by-product from the improving of\r\nthe rivers for navigation. The development of the water-power\r\npossibilities of the country is now going forward at a rapid rate,\r\nhowever.\r\n\r\nDams on the Susquehanna River will soon make 30,000 horse-power\r\navailable, which could be increased to 200,000 by building storage\r\nreservoirs.\r\n\r\nA dam just begun at the rapids of the Mississippi River at Keokuk, Iowa,\r\nwill, when completed, furnish 200,000 horse-power. Niagara is producing\r\n56,000 horse-power on the United States side. The Muscle Shoals Falls\r\nrapids in the Tennessee River is furnishing 188,000 horse-power.\r\nIllinois will greatly increase its possibilities for offering cheap\r\npower to factories, when the Lakes to Gulf Canal with 173,000,000\r\nhorse-power worth $12,750,000 yearly, and the Chicago Drainage or\r\nSanitary Canal, which has nearly 60,000 horse-power, are complete. Both\r\nof these projects were undertaken by the state.\r\n\r\nIn California 250,000 horse-power is now in operation, and 5,000,000\r\nhorse-power might easily be developed in that state alone, which at the\r\nprice of coal would be worth a billion dollars a year.\r\n\r\nNew England has the oldest system of water-power control, because before\r\nthe era of steam it was the chief manufacturing region of the country.\r\nThe Merrimac, flowing through New Hampshire and Massachusetts, is the\r\nmost carefully conserved river in the world, and Governor Dingley of\r\nMaine said that the water-power of Maine is equal to the working energy\r\nof 13,000,000 men.\r\n\r\nThe money value is counted at twenty dollars a year per horse power, but\r\nit frequently brings as high as one hundred or even one hundred and\r\nfifty dollars a year in a good manufacturing region, so that the value\r\nof our water-power facilities can hardly be computed.\r\n\r\nAn ideal picture of the harmonious development of our water resources\r\nfor all purposes is one that is not too difficult to realize. It is the\r\nideal that should be always before us in the improvement of our\r\nwaterways, and we should bear in mind that although the expense will be\r\nheavy, it will not cost more than one-tenth as much to improve all the\r\nimportant waterways as to equip the railways to carry the traffic they\r\nwill be called on to carry in the next ten years; and also that in the\r\npast, for every dollar that has been spent on waterways, almost\r\ntwenty-five dollars has been spent on railways. The railways are a great\r\nand important part of our national development, but the waterways should\r\nnot be neglected. Rather, the two should be so harmonized and adjusted\r\nas to make one great commercial system that will furnish cheap and\r\nabundant transportation for all our commerce.\r\n\r\nThe most complete plan for conserving our waters is as follows: First,\r\nbuild storage reservoirs along the upper stretches of the river to hold\r\nthe overflow waters of the flood season which are to be turned into the\r\nmain channel when the water becomes too low for ordinary navigation.\r\n\r\nThese storage reservoirs should be on the lowest grade of land, that\r\nwhich would be least productive. The reservoirs should be well stocked\r\nwith the best varieties of fish to make them profitable. The banks\r\nshould be planted with forest trees and made as attractive as they can\r\nbe made to form public parks and pleasure grounds for the people, where\r\nboating, fishing and bathing may be enjoyed.\r\n\r\nThe next point is to remove all obstructions from the river, to canalize\r\nit at shallow places or rapids, so that the whole river will be\r\nnavigable, and, if necessary, to deepen the channel so that it will\r\ncarry large vessels between two important points.\r\n\r\nDams should be built to take advantage of every opportunity for\r\nwater-power. One of the worst mistakes in the past has been the failure\r\nto use the power that might have been developed in improving the streams\r\nfor navigation.\r\n\r\nRivers should be made profitable still further by stocking with fish and\r\nshould be kept clear of factory refuse and sewage. Soil-wash should be\r\nlessened by planting trees and shrubs along the banks; and where\r\noverflow or erosion lowers the value of the land or repeatedly ruins the\r\ncrops, dykes and levees should be built.\r\n\r\nThe rivers most important commercially should be improved first. Canals\r\nshould be cut between waterways where large benefits will result;\r\noverflow and swamp land should be drained, and in arid regions every\r\nparticle of water conserved for irrigation purposes.\r\n\r\nThe irrigation canals may also be used to supply water-power, and the\r\ncanals may be used as are other canals for towing barges. If electric\r\npower is produced, electric towing is cheap and very desirable as a\r\nmeans of transportation.\r\n\r\nIn short, our water supply should be as carefully used and with as\r\nlittle waste as the land of forests. The most important improvements\r\nneeded are, a Lakes to Gulf Waterway that shall be safe and practicable\r\nat least for vessels of moderate size; the improvement of the Ohio,\r\nMissouri, Tennessee and Upper Mississippi Rivers; an inner coast passage\r\nfrom New England to Florida, and in navigable rivers dredging and\r\ndeepening if necessary, to make many outlets to the sea which will\r\nafford cheap transportation.\r\n\r\nIn the West, the Columbia, San Joaquin and Sacramento Rivers with their\r\nbranches should be made navigable. Many western rivers have been almost\r\nruined by filling with rocks in hydraulic mining, but this is now\r\nprohibited by law and if the channels were cleared they would again\r\nbecome navigable.\r\n\r\nAppropriations for much of this work have already been made by Congress,\r\nbut the work is not systematically planned. The cost of all of it would\r\nbe about sixty-two and a half cents a year for each man, woman and child\r\nin the country and every one would receive some benefit.\r\n\r\nThe National Conservation Commission on Waterways found that the average\r\nfamily pays for transportation or freight on all its food and clothing\r\nand the necessities of life, nearly or quite one-third their actual\r\ncost. \"It is estimated that the direct benefits would be a yearly saving\r\nin freight handling of $250,000,000, a yearly saving in flood damage of\r\n$150,000,000, a saving in forest fires of at least $25,000,000, a\r\nbenefit through cheapened power of fully $75,000,000 and a yearly saving\r\nin farm production of $500,000,000; a total of $1,000,000,000, or twelve\r\ndollars and fifty cents for each person--twenty times the cost! And this\r\ndoes not take into account the benefits from irrigation, drainage, and\r\nthe lessening of disease by a pure water supply.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nREFERENCES\r\n\r\nWaters.

Heretofore we have been dealing with resources that can be\r\nrenewed, the soil by proper management, the forests by replanting, the\r\nwaters by nature's own processes; but the fuels, the iron and many other\r\nmineral resources once used are gone for ever.\r\n\r\nAs to their importance Andrew Carnegie says: \"Of all the world's metals\r\niron is in our day the most useful. The opening of the iron age marked\r\nthe beginning of real industrial development. To-day the position of\r\nnations may almost be measured by its production and use. Iron and coal\r\nform the foundation of our prosperity. The value of each depends upon\r\nthe amount and nearness of the other. In modern times the manufacturing\r\nand transportation industries rest upon them, and with sufficient land\r\nand a fertile soil, these determine the progress of any people.\"\r\n\r\nWe are sometimes told that we need have no anxiety about the future,\r\nthat new discoveries and inventions will take the place of the present\r\nfuels, and even substitutes for minerals will be devised long before the\r\nsupply is exhausted. This may be true, and in a way the future must take\r\ncare of itself, but until new inventions have actually been made it is\r\ncriminal to waste present resources and blindly trust that time will\r\nmake our folly appear good judgment and foresight.\r\n\r\nWe have vast mineral resources unused; the present generation, even its\r\nchildren and its children's children need have no fear of a shortage.\r\nBut in the use of those resources that are steadily and for ever\r\ndiminishing we must look a long way into the future. We are under the\r\nmost solemn obligation to take only our part of the store, and leave the\r\nrest untouched and unspoiled for those who are to come after us. When we\r\nconsider what these mineral resources have done for our country in the\r\nlast fifty years, when we realize that it is only by having cheap and\r\nabundant coal, iron, and copper that our railroads, our various electric\r\nsystems, and our great manufactories have been developed, we can realize\r\nour duty to give the coming generations an equal opportunity to develop\r\ntheir ideas.\r\n\r\nThe yearly products of the mines of the United States are now valued at\r\nmore than $2,000,000,000. Sixty-five car-loads of freight out of every\r\nhundred carried by our railroads are made up of mineral products. More\r\nthan a million men are employed at the mines, and more than twice that\r\nnumber in handling and transporting mine products.\r\n\r\nOf every one hundred tons of coal mined in the whole world, the United\r\nStates produces forty-three tons. We supply forty-five tons out of every\r\nhundred of iron ore, twenty-two tons of gold, thirty tons of silver,\r\nthirty-three tons of lead, nearly twenty-eight tons of the zinc, about\r\nfifty-five tons of the copper, and sixty-three tons of the petroleum\r\nconsumed by all civilized countries.\r\n\r\nThis would be a cause for great national pride if we did not need also\r\nto consider the shameful fact that our wastes or losses in the mining,\r\nhandling, and use of our mineral products are estimated at more than\r\n$1,500,000 per day, or, for the year, the gigantic sum of $547,500,000.\r\nThat is, more than one-fourth of the entire output is wasted!\r\n\r\nOf all our minerals, the fuels which supply heat, light, and power for\r\ndomestic and manufacturing purposes, are the most necessary and\r\nimportant. Other materials can not be manufactured without their aid.\r\nAlmost every particular of modern life would be changed if we no longer\r\nhad plenty of fuel. Its use means its immediate and complete\r\ndestruction, which is true of no other resource, and the use of fuels is\r\nincreasing and will increase so rapidly that their conservation is\r\nbecoming a serious problem.\r\n\r\nThe principal fuels are coal, gas, oil, peat, alcohol, and wood, and of\r\nthese, coal is at present by far the most important. The first record of\r\ncoal mined in this country was in 1814, when twenty-two tons of\r\nanthracite, or hard coal, were mined in Pennsylvania. An increasing\r\namount was mined each year, but until 1821 the production was less than\r\nfive hundred tons per year. In 1822 the production advanced to nearly\r\n60,000 tons, and since that time has increased by leaps and bounds.\r\n\r\nDuring the seventy-five years from 1820 to 1895, nearly 4,000,000,000\r\ntons were mined by methods so wasteful that 6,000,000,000 tons were\r\ndestroyed or allowed to remain in the ground so that it could never be\r\nrecovered. Within the next ten years as much was produced as in the\r\nentire seventy-five preceding years, and in this period 3,000,000,000\r\ntons were destroyed or left in the ground beyond the reach of future\r\nuse. Up to this time the actual amount of coal used has been over\r\n7,500,000,000 tons; the waste 9,000,000,000 tons.\r\n\r\nExperts estimate that in the beginning there were somewhere about\r\n2,000,000,000,000 tons of available coal, so that we have now, with all\r\nour wastefulness, used less than two per cent. of our original\r\ninheritance. But we must remember that in the ten years closing with\r\n1905, we used as much as during the entire history of our country up to\r\nthat time, and the rate of consumption is still increasing. In 1907 the\r\namount mined was about 450,000,000 tons. Counting on a continuance of\r\nthe same rate of increase, in 1917 it will be 900,000,000 tons a year,\r\nand if the same conditions should continue for twenty years we should be\r\nusing and wasting in one year as much as we have used in all our history\r\nup to the present time. By that time more than one-eighth of our\r\noriginal supply will be gone, and in less than two hundred years nearly\r\nall of it will have for ever disappeared.\r\n\r\nThat is a long time to look forward, but a short time in looking\r\nbackward. It carries us back only to the childhood of Benjamin Franklin\r\nand others prominent in our early history; and if this nation could look\r\nforward to only an equal period of prosperous development in the future\r\nthe time would seem short indeed.\r\n\r\nBut the danger of our coal supply becoming exhausted lies not so much in\r\nits present use as in the rapid increase in its consumption. Fifty years\r\nago (about the time of the Civil War) we were using an amount equal to a\r\nlittle more than a quarter of a ton for every man, woman and child then\r\nin the country. Now the rate is five tons, or twenty times that amount,\r\nfor each person of all our greatly increased population.\r\n\r\nThe Pittsburg Coal Company owns about one-seventh of the great\r\nPennsylvania anthracite fields. From the amount it is now mining each\r\nyear and judging from the amount of coal it is able, with present\r\nmethods, to reclaim from an acre of coal land, the estimate is made that\r\nthis Pittsburg field will be exhausted in ninety-three years. A like\r\ncomparison of all the eastern fields indicates that by the beginning of\r\nthe next century there will be practically no cheap fuel left in the\r\nentire Appalachian basin.\r\n\r\nThe Geological Survey reports that, taking into account the available\r\ncoal which can be reached and mined by present methods, and supposing\r\nthe present conditions of use, waste, and increase to continue, the coal\r\nsupply will be exhausted by the year 2015 A. D., but taking into account\r\nthe probable improvements in its use, the year 2027 A. D. is estimated\r\nas the time when the present coal fields will be exhausted, and the\r\nmiddle of that century as the time when all coal fields in the United\r\nStates will be gone.\r\n\r\nThis true story well illustrates the need of conservation and the folly\r\nof careless waste. High in the hills of the Pittsburg region a thick\r\nbed of excellent coal was found by the early settlers. It was impossible\r\nfor them to build roads up the steep cliffs, so some method of getting\r\nthe coal down to the valleys had to be devised. Buffaloes roamed the\r\nwestern plains in countless millions, and were so abundant about\r\nPittsburg that the supply seemed inexhaustible. So the pioneers killed\r\nthe buffaloes, filled each skin with a few bushels of coal, sewed it up,\r\nand tumbled it down the mountain side.\r\n\r\nThis was the way they marketed their coal--by destroying their\r\nbuffaloes. For many years no one dreamed that there was any end to the\r\nsupply of buffaloes. And so both east and west they were killed for\r\ntheir skins, which sold for a few cents, for their horns, for a supply\r\nof steak, or for mere sport; and then one day people woke up to find\r\nthat the buffalo had disappeared, not in one settlement only, as they\r\nhad supposed, but everywhere. There are a few remaining, carefully cared\r\nfor by the government. They are among our most valued possessions, and\r\nyet only a few years ago they were destroyed, wasted, by millions.\r\n\r\nThis passing of the buffalo, the skins of which, as common then as\r\nburlap bags are now, were used to market our first coal, carries with it\r\na deep lesson as to what will happen to the coal itself, even within\r\nthe present century, unless our people awake to the consequence of what\r\nthey are doing and make a determined effort to stop all unnecessary\r\nwaste.\r\n\r\nLet us see where and how these wastes occur. The first serious loss of\r\nour coal occurs at the mines. There are three great wastes in mining.\r\n\r\n(1) A coal bed is not made up entirely of pure coal, especially if it be\r\nvery thick. Sometimes there are layers of shale or clay, which makes a\r\nlarge amount of ash. This can never be sold as regular marketable coal;\r\nbut it is rich in carbon, and much of it might be used if it could be\r\nmarketed near the mines and sold as low-grade coal. In the past there\r\nhas been almost no market for it, and if it were either in the roof or\r\nbottom of the coal bed, it has been left unmined. If mixed with pure\r\ncoal, the low-grade coal was thrown into great heaps at the mouth of the\r\nmine. This refuse coal is called culm. The amount varies from one-tenth\r\nto one-half of the coal in nearly every coal bed, and would probably\r\naverage one-fourth in all the mines of the country.\r\n\r\nThis material is rich in carbon, and when used in gas-engines will\r\nfurnish more power than the best Pocahontas coal when steam-engines are\r\nused. Thus one-fourth of all our coal is wasted at the mines simply\r\nbecause steam-engines instead of gas-producer engines have been\r\nemployed. If in the future installation of power this fact is taken into\r\nconsideration, it will make the cost less to the user, and at the same\r\ntime utilize a large proportion of our impure coal and save the higher\r\ngrades for other purposes.\r\n\r\n(2) In the mining of coal it was formerly the unfailing custom to leave\r\nsupporting pillars of coal for the over-lying rocks to rest upon, to\r\nmake suitable working-rooms, etc. These pillars, twelve to eighteen\r\ninches square, and higher than a man's head, are scattered throughout\r\nthe entire mines and are usually of the highest grade coal. In many\r\nmines, also, a roof of coal a foot or more in thickness must be left\r\nbecause the material above the coal is not solid enough to prevent\r\ncave-ins. When the mine is abandoned and closed these pillars and\r\nroofings remain untouched, because removing them constitutes one of the\r\ngreatest dangers to life, and is one of the frequent causes of mine\r\naccidents. It is improbable that the coal thus left in abandoned mines\r\nwill ever be reclaimed, because not enough is left to make it profitable\r\nat present prices to re-open the mines; and frequently the rocks cave in\r\nabout these pillars and make the task almost impossible.\r\n\r\n(3) By careless blasting an unnecessarily large amount of coal is blown\r\ninto powder,--the slack which has not been marketed at all until within\r\nthe last few years. Much of this slack, which is the best grade of coal\r\nin a pulverized form, is left inside the mines. These wastes in\r\nabandoned roofing, pillars, and small-sized coal, together make a total\r\nwhich for all the mines in the country will average fully one-fourth\r\nmore of the coal that is in the ground.\r\n\r\nIt is to be noted, however, that conditions are changing for the better.\r\nThe most modern mines use fewer supporting pillars of coal, and these\r\nare of larger size, so that there is less danger of accidents. Wherever\r\npossible they use timbers of wood instead of these smaller pillars of\r\ncoal. They also mine as near the top of the seam of coal as can be done\r\nsafely, and so regulate the blasting that much less slack is made than\r\nby the heavy discharges. These changes in mining methods save a far\r\nlarger proportion of coal, and also prevent many accidents, which are\r\nthe most unfortunate feature of coal mining, and the one which should\r\nreceive most careful consideration. (See chapter on Health.)\r\n\r\nOne large mining company in Kentucky raises its own timbers by planting\r\ntrees in straight, close rows on its coal land, thus making the land\r\nproduce its own mine timbers to conserve the coal below. This company\r\nclaims to have lost but one life in ten years, and to save seventy-five\r\nper cent. of its coal. This is a striking illustration of what better\r\nmining methods will do for both the miner and the mine owner and of how\r\nforestry may be an aid to the conservation of coal and also of human\r\nlife in the mines.\r\n\r\nWe have already shown how half of the coal is wasted, but there still\r\nremains another source of waste at the mines. This is a large but\r\nunknown quantity. Coal usually exists in beds or layers with shale or\r\nrock between, much as a \"layer-cake\" is made, the layers of cake being\r\nrepresented by the coal and the icing between by these \"rock-partings,\"\r\nas they are called. In rich fields, there are from three to ten of these\r\nrich layers or beds of coal, one above another. It often happens that\r\nthe thickest and best layer is the lowest, and when this is the case, it\r\nis usually mined first, regardless of the fact that some, and possibly\r\nall, of the higher beds are dislocated and broken or filled with deadly\r\ngases. Nearly all this loss could be avoided by simply mining the upper\r\nstratum first.\r\n\r\nSo much for waste at the mines. This is serious enough if it were all,\r\nbut it is not all, it is only the beginning. Let us see now what becomes\r\nof the coal that is marketed. The railroads are the largest single users\r\nof coal, and here we are confronted with the surprising statement that\r\nour locomotives consume three tons of coal in doing the same work that\r\nis performed by English locomotives with one ton. This difference is\r\nsaid to be due to different construction of the engines themselves, and\r\nto more careful stoking, or firing. Our locomotives use 100,000,000 tons\r\nper year, and by even the best methods known a large proportion of the\r\nheat units is wasted. Great effort should be made to improve the\r\nlocomotives so that they will consume less coal; but as long as the\r\nrailroad companies own the coal mines, as they do in many instances,\r\nthey can obtain coal so cheaply that the cost of the improved form of\r\nengine is greater than the amount saved.\r\n\r\nAnother great use lies in the manufacture of coke, which is used in the\r\nmaking of steel, and here, too, we see where great wastes have existed.\r\nThe old form of coke-oven was called the bee-hive on account of its\r\nshape. These old style ovens consume all the coal with the exception of\r\nthe fixed carbon which is left behind as coke. At the prices which\r\nprevailed in 1907, the value of the by-products wasted in bee-hive\r\ncoke-ovens was a little over $55,000,000--surely a loss worth\r\nconsidering. A different form of coke-ovens is much used abroad and is\r\ncoming into use in this country. This is the retort or by-product oven,\r\nsometimes called the recovery oven.\r\n\r\nThe bee-hive ovens are usually located near the mines where the cost of\r\ncoal is low, with small expense for transporting it. On the other hand,\r\nthe by-product ovens are established near the larger cities in order to\r\ndispose of their gas and other by-products. Here the cost of\r\ntransportation must be added to that of the coal, but the products are\r\nmarketed near by instead of at a distance, as in the case of the\r\nbee-hive ovens. The most improved by-product ovens produce not only coke\r\nand gas, but coal-tar, pitch, ammonia, and creosoting oils, all\r\nextremely valuable and adding greatly to the value of the output of the\r\novens.\r\n\r\nElectricity is another form of light and power which involves a large\r\nwaste of the energy of coal; only one-fifth of one per cent., that is,\r\none-five hundredth of the value of the coal is used in electricity, and\r\nthere is at present no known remedy for this.\r\n\r\nThere are methods, however, of lessening even this waste, and these are\r\nconstantly receiving more attention. One is for the electric plants\r\nlocated in cities to sell their exhaust steam or water heated by the\r\ncoal as it is converted into electric power, as a by-product. The\r\nelectric power-house thus becomes a central heating plant to supply\r\nstores, offices, and residences. Another system being tried abroad,\r\nthough scarcely past the experimental stage in this country, establishes\r\ngreat electric power-houses at the coal mines to use the culm,\r\nlow-grade slack, and lignites, the lowest form of coal, in short, all\r\nthe waste of the mines. Still another plan is the manufacturing of\r\nelectricity by water-power, as we have seen in a previous chapter.\r\n\r\nThe manufacturing industries of the country waste a large amount of fuel\r\nannually, but here the waste is mostly due to expensive methods of\r\nproducing power, and to careless stoking, and is largely preventable. As\r\nwe have shown, gas-engines are a far more economical form of producing\r\npower than are steam-engines. Steam uses from five to ten per cent. of\r\nthe heat-units of coal, gas-producer engines use fifty per cent. and\r\nburn a lower grade of coal.\r\n\r\nOne of the great problems of cities is the heavy volume of bituminous or\r\nsoft coal smoke that hangs over the entire surrounding region, levying a\r\nheavy tax in cleaning and laundry work, making the air difficult to\r\nbreathe, and shutting out the daylight itself. Every residence adds its\r\nmite, but the factories and public buildings are the worst offenders.\r\nThere are several good smoke-consuming devices on the market that have\r\nbeen thoroughly tested by the government, which will furnish their names\r\non application.\r\n\r\nIf factory owners who use steam power could realize that the gases, the\r\nhighest heat-producing part of the coal, escape with the smoke, and\r\nthat by using smoke consumers they not only prevent all the evils of\r\nthe smoke nuisance but save fully half of the value of their coal, they\r\nwould gladly put in this equipment. What manufacturer would not eagerly\r\nwelcome any device that would cut his fuel bills in half?\r\n\r\nThe other cause of waste of coal in the manufacturing industries is\r\nrecklessness in the use of fuel, filling the furnaces with the drafts so\r\ndisposed that much of the heat is wasted. Every factory owner should\r\nlearn (from the government reports if he has no other means of learning)\r\nthe best methods of firing furnaces, and should employ them in his\r\nfactory.\r\n\r\nThe last great waste of coal is in households. In stoves and furnaces,\r\nand to a certain extent in kitchen ranges, this waste is through\r\ncarelessness in firing, as it is in factories. There still remains a\r\nlarge amount of wasted energy in cooking that is unavoidable. The amount\r\nof coal consumed before certain articles can be cooked, the heat\r\nremaining after the meal is prepared, are wastes that it seems\r\nimpossible to prevent, though wise management will prevent undue waste\r\neven here. Fireless cookers, an invention of recent years, go far toward\r\nsolving the problem of waste by long hours of cooking single articles,\r\nand each year we see more prepared food bought in order to save the\r\ncost of heat. Housekeepers find that it does not pay to bake their bread\r\nthemselves, since a dozen loaves can be baked in a large oven with the\r\nfuel used in baking one at home.\r\n\r\nBriquettes are a new form of fuel made from coal, principally for\r\nhousehold use. They are made from the low-grade coals, culm, slack and\r\nlignites, blended with coal-tar pitch. They are commonly used not only\r\nin households, but for locomotives and ships, in several European\r\ncountries, especially Germany; but in this country the cost of making\r\nthem--about a dollar per ton--makes the retail price higher than the\r\ncheaper grades of coal, and their general introduction at the price of\r\nthe higher grades is rather slow.\r\n\r\nLet it always be kept in mind that we must not check the careful use,\r\nonly the waste, and the best way to avoid an unnecessary drain on the\r\ncoal and at the same time increase our manufactures is to substitute\r\nother power. Coal is only a form of energy that came originally from the\r\nsun. The same causes that produced coal still exist. Scientists tell us\r\nthat coal is still being made, but it will take thousands of years to\r\nperfect it. If we could only learn to take the sun's heat directly and\r\nuse it for our heat, light, and power, it would be one of the greatest\r\ndiscoveries in the history of the world, greater even than the discovery\r\nof electricity.\r\n\r\nMany attempts have been made to produce power directly from the sun\r\nthrough solar engines, or by concentrating it in furnaces. At the St.\r\nLouis Exposition a few years ago, a Portuguese priest exhibited a solar\r\nengine called a heliophore, in which, by means of the sun's rays, the\r\ntemperature was raised to 6000 degrees F., and a cube of iron placed in\r\nit melted like a snowball. The sun helps to raise the tides and some day\r\nthey may be used to produce power. Many experiments are being made with\r\nboth solar and tidal energy, some of them successful in a small way, but\r\nnothing that is ready to stand the test of every-day use has been\r\ndevised.\r\n\r\nDoctor Pritchell says that on a clear day when the sun is high, it\r\ndelivers upon each acre of the earth's surface exposed to its rays, the\r\nequal of 7,500 horse-power working continually. If the extra energy not\r\nneeded for the growth of plants and animals could be used, all the work\r\nof the world could be done and the problem of fuel supply would be\r\nsolved for ever.\r\n\r\nBut the greatest conservation of coal possible at present lies in the\r\nuse of the water-power which now goes to waste, and which, if employed,\r\nwould, as we have seen, give us 30,000,000 horse-power, or more than all\r\nthat is now produced from fuel by all our engines combined.\r\n\r\nAlabama offers a striking illustration of this failure to take advantage\r\nof our opportunities, for Alabama has both coal and water-power.\r\nEngineers estimate that the three principal rivers have power equal to\r\n436,000 horse-power. At Muscle Shoals, on the Tennessee River, there is\r\nnow developed 188,000 horse-power, second only to Niagara--and if the\r\nwaters were conserved, the figures would reach 1,084,000 horse-power on\r\nthe three rivers. This means that, according to the amount of coal\r\nrequired to produce each horse-power of energy, it would require\r\n11,201,000 tons of coal each year to produce by steam as much power as\r\nthese streams might easily be made to produce.\r\n\r\nAlabama, as we have said, is also a great coal state. It is now mining\r\nabout 14,000,000 tons per year and only four states produce a larger\r\namount. It will be seen that four tons out of five mined in this state\r\nwill be needed to produce by steam the power that is going to waste in\r\nits rivers. The Honorable W. P. Lay, of the Alabama Conservation\r\nCommission, in calling attention to this fact, says:\r\n\r\n\"Suppose for a moment that the coal fields of Alabama were sliding down\r\nan incline and pouring off over a precipice at the rate of 11,201,000\r\ntons per year, how long would it take the people of the United States\r\nto do something to try to stop such a waste? Yet what else are we doing\r\nwhen we sit idly by and let the water of these streams go to waste over\r\na precipice while we ourselves burn up the coal?\"\r\n\r\nAnd what is true in Alabama is true to a lesser extent in most of the\r\nstates. Wherever water-power is going to waste, coal is being used to\r\ntake its place, and that coal is needed in some place where there is no\r\nwater-power.\r\n\r\nOn a certain stream in one of the central states was a fine waterfall.\r\nThe early settlers built a mill there. The water turned the mill-wheel\r\nand then passed on to water the valley and turn other mill-wheels. But\r\none night the old mill was destroyed by fire. It was not rebuilt, but\r\nsome distance from the stream a new steam mill was built, the motive\r\npower of which was natural gas. When, after a few years, the natural gas\r\nwas all gone, the miller began to use coal, and he still uses\r\ncoal--hundreds of tons of it--while the water which once turned the\r\nwheels, runs idly over the falls. This is an example of wholly useless\r\nwaste of coal, and just such waste is to be found in hundreds of places\r\nin our country.\r\n\r\nIf wise mining methods be put into operation, if proper care be taken in\r\nits use, particularly in manufacturing, if the low-grade coals be\r\nutilized, and if other power be substituted wherever practicable, there\r\nneed be no question of shortage. There is enough coal in the ground, if\r\nused rightly, to last for ages to come. But because we have wasted vast\r\nquantities of it in the past, and are still wasting it, so that if the\r\nsame conditions continue we can distinctly see the end in sight, it is\r\nimportant that every one understands what these conditions of use and\r\nwaste are, and how the abuse may be corrected, so that mine owners and\r\nconsumers may all work together to preserve this most necessary\r\nresource.\r\n\r\n\r\nREFERENCES\r\n\r\nCoal is King.

In rural districts and in lumber\r\nregions it is still used extensively; but in the cities, larger towns,\r\nand manufacturing regions, it is not used in commercial quantities. Its\r\nuse for power production is limited to the wood-working factories which\r\nhave a large amount of waste lumber and which employ this by-product to\r\nfurnish heat for steam boilers.\r\n\r\nThe wood used for fuel or for power usually represents what would\r\notherwise be lost, the dead trees and the unmarketable timber of the\r\nfarmer's wood-lot, the refuse of lumber regions or the waste of\r\nwood-working factories. So that the use of wood as fuel now generally\r\nmeans the conservation of our coal supply, and a use for the low-grade\r\nparts of the forest.\r\n\r\nIn some cases, however, farmers cut for fuel fine young trees that\r\nwould grow into excellent timber. Liberal planting of trees so that wood\r\nshall become plentiful in all parts of the country will tend to bring\r\nabout again a larger use of wood as fuel, which will thus once more\r\nbecome a factor in the saving of our coal. Every farmer should learn to\r\nsave all valuable trees for lumber, and to use only undesirable ones for\r\nfuel.\r\n\r\n\r\nPEAT\r\n\r\nPeat is said by geologists to be only \"coal in the making,\" carbon that\r\nis in the state of changing from vegetable matter to coal. It is\r\nprobable that in the course of centuries this would become coal, and in\r\nits present state it has many of the properties of coal, though it has\r\nnot nearly so high a heating value.\r\n\r\nIn this country we have had such a wealth of fuel resources--coal, wood,\r\noil, and gas--that up to the present time we have done little to develop\r\nour peat beds, although in European countries ten million tons are used\r\nannually for fuel, as well as large quantities for other purposes. From\r\nthe earliest times peat has been the principal fuel of the common people\r\nof Ireland and some of the countries of northern Europe.\r\n\r\nNow, however, people are trying to make the best of many resources not\r\nheretofore developed, coal prices are steadily advancing and the two\r\ncauses combine to turn people's attention to the peat beds of America.\r\nOne point that is worthy of notice is that peat is found mostly in\r\nregions where there is no coal, oil, or natural gas. The development of\r\npeat beds in those regions, it will be seen, would give them a great\r\nadvantage in the matter of cheap fuel.\r\n\r\nLarge peat beds are found in Minnesota, Wisconsin, Michigan, New York,\r\nNew England, New Jersey, Florida, the Dakotas, northern Iowa, Illinois,\r\nIndiana, Ohio, Pennsylvania, eastern Virginia, the Carolinas and\r\nGeorgia; and near the coast in the gulf states, and a narrow strip along\r\nthe Pacific coast, from southern California to the Canadian border. They\r\ncover an area of about 11,000 square miles and are supposed to contain\r\nnot less than 14,000,000,000 tons of air-dried peat. At the rate of\r\nthree dollars per ton, which is a reasonable price in the states having\r\nno coal, this peat would have a value of more than $40,000,000,000.\r\n\r\nPeat is prepared for use as common fuel in two ways: (1) By cutting it\r\ninto blocks or bricks, which are air-dried by exposure to sun and wind\r\nfor a few weeks. This is called \"cut peat,\" is bulky and easily\r\nbreakable, and can be used only for local consumption. (2) By digging\r\neither by hand or machine, and grinding it in a mill. It is put in wet,\r\nground, cut with rapidly turning knives, and passed out of the machine\r\nas a thick pulp that is cut into bricks as it comes out. It is then\r\nstored several weeks until thoroughly dried. This is called \"machine\r\npeat,\" \"pressed peat,\" or \"condensed peat.\"\r\n\r\nPeat is being used in many ways. (1) Air-dried peat is used for fuel\r\nonly. (2) Dry peat without a binder, or mixed with coal dust and tar or\r\npitch is used for the same purpose. (3) Machine peat is used for many\r\npurposes, among them making into briquettes, peat charcoal, and peat\r\ncoke.\r\n\r\nIt has been found practical to make illuminating gas of peat, but a far\r\nmore general use is for running gas-engines and producer-gas furnaces.\r\nThis is a practical use for it, since it will conserve the coal now used\r\nfor that purpose, furnish satisfactory power without smoke or dirt,\r\nprovide cheap power in regions that have no coal mines, and lastly may\r\nbe made to yield valuable by-products: ammonia, acetic acid, paraffin,\r\ntar, creosote, and wood-alcohol. If all the peat in the United States\r\ncould be used in producer-gas engines the ammonia yielded would alone\r\nhave a value of $36,000,000,000.\r\n\r\nPeat is also used for packing material, as a fertilizer, for\r\nmanufacturing paper, for coarse cloth and mattress filling. By mixing\r\nwet machine peat with cement it may be made into blocks for paving and\r\nother construction work. The most promising uses are for fuel, as\r\nbedding for stock, as a disinfectant, in briquettes for burning lime,\r\nbrick, and pottery, in which it is finding a large use, and for which it\r\nis said to be particularly well fitted; and most satisfactory of all,\r\nits use in gas-producer engines. In Florida an immense plant is being\r\nbuilt to manufacture electric power, using air-dried peat as fuel, the\r\npower to be transmitted to Jacksonville.\r\n\r\nMachine peat is supposed to have sixty-five per cent. the value of the\r\nsame weight of Pocahontas coal, but on account of the lack of waste in\r\npeat its real value is higher than would appear from the comparison.\r\nFrom two to two and a half pounds will produce one horse-power per hour\r\nin gas-producer engines. By this estimate, we can see that the peat beds\r\nof this country, if properly used, may be largely employed, either now\r\nor in the future, as a substitute for the vanishing coal.\r\n\r\n\r\nNATURAL GAS\r\n\r\nOf all the fuels, natural gas may be said to be the ideal one. Coming\r\nfrom the ground, it is piped a greater or less distance and distributed\r\nto the home or factory for light, heat, or power; for all of which it is\r\nequally desirable. It is ready for our use at the turn of a key, is\r\nabsolutely clean, having neither dust, ash, nor unconsumed portions. It\r\nrequires no kindling other than a lighted match.\r\n\r\nNatural gas is found over an area which, if combined, would cover almost\r\n10,000 square miles. It exists in twenty-two states--Alabama,\r\nCalifornia, Colorado, Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Missouri, Montana,\r\nNew York, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon,\r\nPennsylvania, South Dakota, Texas, Utah, Washington, West Virginia,\r\nWyoming. In some of them the area has been large and the production very\r\nheavy, in others the field is small and unproductive. Until the last two\r\nor three years there have been no statistics as to the quantity of gas\r\npiped, but an account of its value has been kept for many years. For the\r\ntwenty years beginning with 1888 the value is given at nearly\r\n$500,000,000.\r\n\r\nIt must be remembered that much of this represents extremely low prices,\r\nonly the amount actually paid for its use. When gas is newly discovered\r\nin a region it is not considered an opportunity for the residents of the\r\ncommunity to have cheap light, power and fuel for themselves, but\r\ninstead as an opportunity to develop the country, to increase the\r\npopulation and attract new factories. In order to advertise and boom\r\ntheir communities free gas is usually offered to factories. So in\r\ndozens of instances large factories have been operated for years without\r\na cent having been paid for fuel. For this reason no proper estimate can\r\nbe made of the quantity of gas consumed, nor of its value even at a\r\nnominal price. In 1907, (the last year for which complete returns have\r\nbeen published in government reports) the amount of gas consumed was\r\ngiven at 404,000,000 cubic feet, which at present prices is valued at\r\n$63,000,000.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to determine in any way the future production of\r\nnatural gas, or to guess at the quantity remaining in the earth. It may\r\nbe much less or much more than present conditions would indicate; but\r\nthe present known fields are limited, and the pressure is growing\r\nsteadily less in all of them.\r\n\r\nThe Conservation Commission reports, \"It is safe to predict that the\r\nknown fields will be exhausted in twenty-five years.\" The decrease of\r\nnatural gas is strikingly illustrated in Indiana. This state, perhaps\r\nmore than any other, profited directly by the discovery of its natural\r\ngas about twenty years ago. Here, the mineral maps show, is by far the\r\ngreatest natural gas region in the United States. With the discovery of\r\nnatural gas, established towns grew to ten times their former size and\r\nnew ones sprang up everywhere. Indiana, which had been chiefly an\r\nagricultural state, bade fair to become one of the foremost\r\nmanufacturing states on account of its cheap and abundant fuel. In 1902\r\nIndiana produced nearly $8,000,000 worth of natural gas, but for 1908\r\nthe State Geologist's report contained no figures for this product. It\r\nhad ceased to be a prominent factor in the wealth of the state! There is\r\nno resource that has been so shamefully, so hopelessly wasted as our\r\nnatural gas.\r\n\r\nWith even more recklessness than characterizes the waste of our forests\r\nand our coal, we have allowed this perfect fuel to escape. To the\r\ndwellers in each region where natural gas is found, it seems that the\r\nsupply is inexhaustible. The roar of the wells, which makes the very\r\nearth tremble; the flames springing high into the air; the undiminished\r\npressure after months of use, appearing to indicate a boundless\r\nreservoir below; the opportunity for whole communities to grow rich by\r\nits use; all these things tend to promote recklessness on the part of\r\nall who handle it. In the beginning the wells are usually not tightly\r\ncased, and there is a considerable quantity of gas escaping about every\r\nwell. New wells are frequently lighted to show the volume of gas. In\r\nsome cases the well has become uncapped on account of heavy pressure and\r\nto prevent the escape of unconsumed gas into the air it is kept burning\r\nnight and day. The strongest wells are often kept burning for months in\r\norder to advertise a new gas field. In this way immense quantities of\r\nthe most perfect fuel in the world have been wantonly wasted. From a\r\nsingle well in eastern Kentucky there flowed a steady stream of gas for\r\ntwenty years which at present prices would be worth $3,000,000, and the\r\nsame story of waste from burning wells comes from every natural gas\r\nfield.\r\n\r\nIn a new region where gas is abundant there is also a great waste from\r\nleaking pipe lines laid on the surface of the ground, from open\r\nflambeaux, and from careless home and factory consumption. In many\r\ncommunities the open flambeaux have been employed to light the streets,\r\nand allowed to burn day and night to avoid the expense of a man to care\r\nfor them. Where natural gas is abundant, meters are not usually\r\ninstalled; instead, gas is sold by the month. The consumer is under no\r\nobligation to save the gas, in fact, he usually acts on the common\r\nAmerican principle of wanting to get all he can for the money and so\r\nburns his open tip lights, and open burner stoves day and night. The\r\nfactories waste in the same way, using open furnaces which are never\r\nbanked during the season because it is easier and costs no more.\r\n\r\nThis, it seems, should be the whole history of natural gas waste, but\r\nthe greatest source of loss still remains to be spoken of. In every gas\r\nregion of any importance oil is found sooner or later, usually after the\r\nheaviest gas pressure has been exhausted; and the oil driller is the\r\ngreatest of all foes to the life of a natural gas region. He finds that\r\nthe gas interferes with the flow of oil, spraying it into the air and\r\ncausing loss, and that the danger of fire is much increased by its\r\npresence. This frequently causes explosions, tearing out the side of the\r\nwell or blowing out the casing, and making the oil-well useless. The\r\nsurplus gas is usually piped to one side out of the reach of danger, and\r\nthen burned to get rid of it. Drillers often try to force the gas out in\r\nthe hope that it will be followed by a rush of oil.\r\n\r\nThis is the heaviest drain on the gas. In the Caddo field in Louisiana\r\nalone the loss is seventy million cubic feet per day, enough to light\r\nten cities the size of Washington, D. C., and equal to ten thousand\r\nbarrels of petroleum per day. In Indiana a few years ago fourteen wells,\r\nall within a space of a few acres in extent, were burned by oil drillers\r\ncontinuously for six months, the light being visible twenty miles away.\r\n\r\nGreater care in the management of the wells and slight additional\r\nexpense for casing are all that is required to stop the waste of gas\r\nfrom oil wells and heavy pressure gas wells.\r\n\r\nAll of these wastes taken together constitute a fearful loss. In 1907,\r\nmore than 400,000,000 cubic feet were used and an almost equal number\r\nwasted. In other words, the daily waste is over a billion cubic feet, or\r\nenough to supply every city in the United States of over one hundred\r\nthousand population.\r\n\r\nThe heating value of a billion feet of gas is equal to a million bushels\r\nof coal. If some great conflagration were sweeping away our coal fields\r\nsteadily every day in the year, and destroying our best coal at the rate\r\nof a million bushels per day, how quickly we should all arise to aid in\r\nchecking it! And yet this imaginary case is actually true in regard to\r\nthe best fuel in this country, which is burning uselessly an equal value\r\nin coal, and our coal must some day be used to supply the loss.\r\n\r\nWe are apt to ignore the greatness of this loss because the gas escapes\r\ninto the air and we can not see it, or it burns and we see only its\r\neffect, not the loss of fuel, but if we could see it in the form of oil\r\nwe should find that a billion feet of gas is equal to more than a\r\nhundred and sixty thousand barrels of petroleum. Think of it, the\r\nequivalent of one hundred and sixty thousand barrels of oil, for which\r\nno price is paid and of which no use is made, for ever destroyed every\r\nday in every year! Would the oil companies permit it? Would we not all\r\nassist them in saving their property from destruction, and shall we not\r\nask of them equal help in saving the fuel that in turn conserves our\r\ncoal supply? Little objection can be made to the present method of using\r\ngas in the older regions. The waste in domestic use is comparatively\r\nsmall. Much is used for lighting with incandescent burners, and asbestos\r\ngrates and gas ranges have replaced the open-burner stoves and grates.\r\nThese are all efficient methods of use, and but little could be done in\r\nthe way of further conservation. In factories the gas-engine is in many\r\ninstances replacing the open furnace, which requires many times as much\r\ngas to produce an equal amount of power. They should be used in every\r\nfactory, and gas companies should also require the use of the best\r\ndevices for saving gas in places where meters are not used.\r\n\r\nUntil last year but one state--Indiana--had an effective law preventing\r\nthe waste of natural gas by oil companies. This law says in substance\r\nthat a man can not take the oil from the ground where nature has safely\r\nstored it, unless he also provide a market for the gas which accompanies\r\nit. It also says that neither the producer nor the consumer shall be\r\nallowed to waste this valuable fuel, as such waste is against public\r\npolicy.\r\n\r\nMr. I. C. White, of West Virginia, in discussing this question at the\r\nConservation Congress said, \"This Indiana statute should be enacted into\r\nlaw in every state where these fuels exist.\" Since that time\r\nPennsylvania and Ohio have passed laws, which are said to be effective,\r\nfor the conservation of natural gas.\r\n\r\nMuch has been accomplished by gas companies, who, since they became\r\nalive to the danger of loss of their investment, have been extremely\r\nwatchful of their property. In West Virginia the gas companies buy the\r\ngas which has been obtained in the drilling of oil wells, thus providing\r\na market for the waste gas and making it possible to continue the oil\r\nbusiness and at the same time to furnish cheap gas.\r\n\r\nAnother hopeful sign is the pumping of all of the product of a well.\r\nFormerly as soon as a well dropped greatly in production it was\r\nabandoned, but now it is pumped until dry.\r\n\r\nOne method by which the gas from oil wells may be utilized consists in\r\ncompressing it in steel cylinders for shipping. This in a small way has\r\nbeen found to be successful.\r\n\r\nExperiments are being tried on a large scale in Ohio to prove that gas\r\nmay be returned to reservoirs within the earth which are tight enough to\r\nhold it under heavy pressure.\r\n\r\nFuel gas made from low-grade coal is a satisfactory substitute for\r\nnatural gas. Like the natural product it may be piped for long\r\ndistances. Some natural gas companies have bought up the culm banks and\r\nheaps of refuse coal, so that if the natural gas becomes exhausted they\r\ncan manufacture cheap gas at the mines and pipe it to the cities they\r\nnow serve.\r\n\r\n\r\nPETROLEUM\r\n\r\nPetroleum, or rock oil, is a dark greenish brown liquid which when\r\nrefined yields gasolene, naphtha, benzine, kerosene, lubricating oils,\r\nand paraffin. The name petroleum applies only to the crude petroleum as\r\nit comes from the ground, and the word oil is applied to the products\r\nobtained by refining.\r\n\r\nThe early history of the petroleum industry in this country is\r\ninteresting as showing what great results spring from small beginnings.\r\nFrom salt wells in Pennsylvania there was an occasional flow of\r\npetroleum, but it had had no commercial value. Samuel Kier, of\r\nPittsburg, had salt wells at Tarantum from which he had accumulated so\r\nmuch petroleum (fifty barrels) that he decided to try to dispose of it,\r\nbut there was no market. No one knew what to do with it. He then partly\r\nrefined it, making a poor quality of kerosene, and introduced a lamp\r\nwith a chimney. This proved so popular that A. C. Ferris, also of\r\nPittsburg, undertook to sell this in other cities, and these two men\r\nnot only sold the fifty barrels and the other petroleum that accumulated\r\nfrom the salt wells, but they had created such a demand for the new\r\nlight that they could not supply enough oil, and in 1859 Colonel Drake\r\ndrilled at Titusville the first well solely for petroleum. In the\r\nhalf-century since that time nearly two billion barrels, or almost two\r\nhundred and fifty million tons, worth one and three-quarter billion\r\ndollars, have been produced.\r\n\r\nPetroleum is now mined, or drilled, in many countries besides the United\r\nStates, but the United States furnishes sixty-three barrels out of every\r\nhundred produced in the world. Russia produces twenty-one barrels,\r\nAustria four, and the East Indies three barrels, Roumania two, India and\r\nMexico one each, Canada, Japan, Germany, Peru, and Italy each less than\r\none barrel; so we can see that the United States is the one great\r\nproducer of petroleum, and that it is to this country that we must look\r\nfor the principal world supply for the present, and as far as known, for\r\nthe future. Let us see, then, what we may expect the United States to do\r\nto supply this demand.\r\n\r\nThe known petroleum lands cover an area of about 8,500 square miles and\r\nare in six large fields and several smaller ones. The largest and best\r\nis the Appalachian, of which the best known is the Pennsylvania field.\r\nIt has a grade of petroleum that differs from any other thus far found\r\nin the world. It is most easily converted into kerosene or lamp oil, and\r\ncontains a larger proportion of such oil. It is the finest petroleum in\r\nthe world, except that found in Indiana and Ohio, and that costs more to\r\nrefine.\r\n\r\nThe Appalachian field includes, besides Pennsylvania, western New York,\r\nWest Virginia, a narrow strip in eastern Ohio, Kentucky and Tennessee.\r\nThese southern oils are of a much lower grade, but are better than the\r\nRussian or other foreign oils.\r\n\r\nThe next great field is called the Lima-Indiana, and covers a\r\nconsiderable portion of northwestern Ohio and eastern Indiana. This\r\npetroleum contains less gasolene and less lamp oils, and more sulphur,\r\nwhich makes refining difficult. The Illinois field lies next. Here, in a\r\nstrip about thirty miles long and six miles wide on an average, an\r\nenormous quantity of petroleum is produced. This oil is slightly lower\r\nin quality and contains considerable asphalt.\r\n\r\nThe mid-continent field lies in Kansas and Oklahoma. This petroleum also\r\ncontains asphalt and other chemical products. Such immense amounts are\r\nproduced here that it has not been possible to care for all of it,\r\neither in the matter of storage tanks or cars for transporting it, and\r\nas a result large amounts have been wasted. In Oklahoma within a space\r\nof less than two square miles one million barrels of forty-two gallons\r\neach of petroleum were wasted in the year 1906.\r\n\r\nThe Gulf field lying in Texas and Louisiana has been developed entirely\r\nsince 1901. The first well was drilled near Beaumont, Texas, as an\r\nexperiment to determine whether oil could be found. Small storage tanks\r\nwere provided and it was hoped to find oil enough to make drilling\r\nprofitable. The well proved to be a \"gusher\" of such magnitude that\r\nbefore sufficient tanks could be provided, or the flow checked, more\r\nthan half a million barrels were wasted on the ground.\r\n\r\nThe Gulf petroleum contains a large amount of asphalt and a small amount\r\nof gasolene and lamp oil. It has been used principally for burning as\r\ncrude oil in locomotives and has sold as low as ten cents per barrel;\r\nbut lately methods of refining have been perfected which produce good\r\nlubricating oil and a gasolene of high value from these low-grade oils.\r\n\r\nThe last great field is found in California. The oil is similar to the\r\nGulf oil, and investigation has shown that the quantity is greater in\r\nthis field than in any other. It is used largely for fuel and power on\r\naccount of lack of other fuels in that region.\r\n\r\nIn addition to these fields there are small ones in Colorado and\r\nWyoming, and promises of fields in New Mexico, Utah, Idaho, Montana,\r\nOregon and Washington.\r\n\r\nEstimates of the amounts of petroleum yielded are made by computing the\r\namount usually produced per acre, which varies from eight hundred\r\nbarrels produced in Pennsylvania, to eight thousand barrels per acre\r\nproduced in Illinois. In most of the fields it is about a thousand\r\nbarrels per acre. Even then the amount is extremely difficult to\r\nestimate. The Geological Survey concludes that the lowest probable\r\ncalculation of the entire amount stored in the rocks of the United\r\nStates is ten billion, and the highest a little less than twenty-five\r\nbillion barrels. The last report officially published shows that we are\r\nproducing one hundred and seventy million barrels per year. If the same\r\nrate of production continues, we might expect our petroleum to last from\r\nfifty-five to one hundred and thirty-five years, according to the amount\r\nfound; but tables of statistics show that throughout the life of the\r\npetroleum industry, as much has been produced each nine years as the\r\nentire product before that time. For example, up to the present, we have\r\nproduced one billion eight hundred million barrels and if the present\r\nrate continues, in the next nine years alone we shall produce an equal\r\nquantity again. The causes of such rapid growth are many. One is the\r\ngreat increase in the use of some of the products, such as gasolene,\r\nwhich has increased many fold since the automobile became popular.\r\nAnother, and the greatest cause, is the ease with which any quantity of\r\noil can be sold for cash at any time, and at prices much above the cost\r\nof production.\r\n\r\nAnother reason is based upon the nature of the product. In pumping from\r\none well oil is apt to flow in from other leases, under other farms, and\r\nexhaust them without the holders of those leases having received any\r\ncompensating benefit. It is therefore necessary for each lessee to get\r\nhis share before it flows away. Under these circumstances, it is\r\nimpossible to prevent an entire field from being drilled over very\r\nrapidly, unless there is a combination of all the interests; or unless\r\nthe law limits the amount that each producer shall extract per acre\r\nwithin a given time.\r\n\r\nPennsylvania and New York have declined to one-third their former value\r\nand yet it is only seventeen years since they reached their highest\r\npoint. This would seem to indicate that the life of that field will not\r\nexceed ten years. West Virginia is producing only a little more than\r\nhalf its former yield and is rapidly declining. Ohio and Indiana are\r\ndeclining more rapidly than Pennsylvania. Texas is also in the rapidly\r\ndeclining class, and in Kansas the production is only a fraction of\r\nwhat it was formerly. On the other hand, Illinois, Oklahoma, and\r\nCalifornia can be expected to increase steadily for several years.\r\n\r\nTaking into account all these factors, it is estimated that the entire\r\nsupply now known to exist would be exhausted before the middle of the\r\npresent century. It appears more probable, however, that increasing\r\nprices long before that time will help to conserve the supply; and that\r\npetroleum will be produced for a long time to come, though not in\r\nsufficient quantities for industrial and general use.\r\n\r\nThe principal uses of petroleum are for burning as crude oil in furnaces\r\nand under boilers, particularly in locomotives. The refined products\r\nhave various uses. Probably the most important is the lubricating oil.\r\nThis is necessary in the development of all kinds of power. At least\r\none-half pint of lubricating oil is used for every ton of coal consumed\r\nfor power. All engines, all street and steam railways, steamships,\r\nsewing-machines, clocks, watches, and automobiles, in fact all operating\r\nmachinery requires its use; so that a large amount of oil must always be\r\nconserved for lubricating purposes.\r\n\r\nCoal oil, or kerosene, may be regarded as absolutely necessary for the\r\nlighting of houses or other establishments not connected with gas or\r\nelectric supply.\r\n\r\nGasolene is sometimes used for lighting, though such use is not common.\r\nIt is largely used for cooking, and still more largely used in the\r\nvarious types of gasolene engines.\r\n\r\nNaphtha is used for power, especially for motor-boats, and for cleaning,\r\nin which it is very valuable by reason of its power to dissolve dirt.\r\n\r\nParaffin is used in polishing, in laundry work, for waxing floors, and\r\nas a covering to exclude air in preserving articles.\r\n\r\nWaste has been markedly absent in the petroleum industry. It is\r\nnecessary that oil drilling outfits shall contain steel storage tanks\r\nfor holding the oil when it is reached. Usually the supply is large\r\nenough, but sometimes, as in the case of the big well at Beaumont,\r\nTexas, the oil gushes forth in such volume that the drillers are not\r\nprepared to take care of the overflow, and much is wasted before the\r\nwell can be capped. In general there is no waste in storage in this\r\ncountry. In European countries where there is oil, the loss through lack\r\nof tanks and by using wooden tanks which leak, is very great.\r\n\r\nAnother form of waste which is common in foreign countries, but which\r\nhas been avoided in the United States, is evaporation of gasolene and\r\nsimilar light products when the petroleum is exposed to the air in open\r\ntanks. This is the most valuable part of petroleum, and if it be exposed\r\nto the sun a single day it loses greatly in value.\r\n\r\nThe refining processes of the petroleum industry are probably carried\r\nout with better system and less waste than in any other resource, owing\r\nto the fact that the business is controlled by large companies. There is\r\nno waste material in its manufacture, except some slight residue that\r\nmight be used for oiling roads, instead of using the crude oil. The\r\nprincipal waste lies in its use. In view of the fact that the supply is\r\nnot unending, is, indeed, rapidly disappearing, the uses should be\r\nconfined only to the necessary lines for which there are no substitutes\r\nat similar prices. These are for lubricating oils and for the lighting\r\nof homes. The unnecessary uses are for burning in locomotives and for\r\nthe development of power.\r\n\r\nWhenever new petroleum fields are opened up, there is a corresponding\r\ndrop in price. In order to dispose of it quickly such petroleum is\r\nusually sold for the lowest grade uses, and the price for this crude\r\npetroleum is not more than one hundredth as much as for high grade\r\npetroleum products. The report of the National Conservation Commission\r\nis so excellent that it is quoted almost word for word.\r\n\r\n\"At present more petroleum is being produced than is necessary for the\r\ndemands of the industry. Within ten years the present fields will be\r\nunable profitably to produce enough for these requirements. The only\r\ndirection in which production can be checked is with the petroleum\r\ncontained in public lands.\r\n\r\n\"Offering such public lands for entry at a low price is nothing more\r\nthan temptation to the private citizen to waste petroleum by over\r\nproduction, since lands yielding hundreds of dollars per acre in this\r\nproduct can be obtained for a small sum. Every acre of public land,\r\nbelieved to contain petroleum or natural gas, should be withdrawn from\r\npublic sale and leased under conditions that regulate production.\r\n\r\n\"Its use for power is justified on the Pacific coast, if used in\r\ngas-producer engines.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nALCOHOL\r\n\r\nAs a substitute for other fuels, wood, or denaturated alcohol, will\r\nprobably come into greater use each year, and is regarded by many as the\r\ngreat fuel of the future, because the materials of which it is made are\r\nwaste vegetable products and will always be plentiful.\r\n\r\nIt is made from cellulose, the woody part of plants, and may be\r\nmanufactured from sawdust when freshly cut from live trees, from small,\r\nand refuse potatoes, from inferior grain that is not worth marketing,\r\nand from low-grade fruits and vegetables of all kinds. It is even said\r\nthat the hundreds of acres of sage-brush in the West that have always\r\nbeen considered worse than useless can be made into wood-alcohol and\r\nthus become a valuable product.\r\n\r\nIt can be used for any purpose that gasolene can, although a different\r\nstyle burner is required. It must be made much hotter before it is\r\nchanged into vapor, and on account of this it has been difficult to make\r\nsatisfactory burners for all the kinds of heating, lighting, and power\r\nwork; the machinery being far from perfect as yet. Wood-alcohol can not\r\nyet be made cheaper than gasolene, and is not so easy to burn, so that\r\nit is slow in reaching an important place in the industrial world; but\r\ngas and gasolene prices will advance, and better methods of\r\nmanufacturing and burning alcohol will be found, and then we shall have\r\na fuel that can take the place of either coal or petroleum for lighting\r\nor power.\r\n\r\nIt is thought that wood-alcohol will be of especial use to the farmer,\r\nsince he has so many waste vegetable products, has so much need of power\r\nin small quantities and is far from the sources of public service\r\npower, such as electric and gas plants. Alcohol-driven motors can be\r\nused to take the place of the labor of both horses and men on the farm.\r\nOn level farms they can run the heavy machines, such as mowers, reapers,\r\nand binders, plows and cultivators. On any farm they may be used to run\r\nstationary engines, to chop and grind food for live stock, to pump\r\nwater, churn, run sewing-machines, operate fans, drive carriages and\r\nwagons and do many other things.\r\n\r\nWood-alcohol produces ammonia as a by-product, is used in the\r\nmanufacture of dyes and coal-tar products, of smokeless powder, of\r\nvarnishes, and of imitation silks made from cotton.\r\n\r\n\r\nREFERENCES\r\n\r\nReport National Conservation Commission.\r\n\r\nReports of Geological Survey.\r\n\r\nConservation of Ores and Related Minerals.

Report Governor's Conference.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nIRON\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have already stated the importance of iron in our modern life. It can\r\nnot be overestimated. All the many articles of iron and steel, our\r\ntools, our machinery, our vehicles, our bridges, our steel buildings,\r\nand a thousand and one other things are dependent on our iron supply.\r\n\r\nOf all the elements that make up the earth's surface only three are more\r\nplentiful than iron, so that we might think that we should always have\r\nan abundant supply of it; but when it occurs in small quantities, as is\r\nusually the case, it can not of course be profitably mined. It is only\r\nwhen enough of it is found together to permit it to be mined to\r\nadvantage that it is called iron ore.\r\n\r\nIron ore is found in only twenty-nine states of the Union, and eighty\r\nper cent. of the present production is in two states, Minnesota and\r\nMichigan. We can see that iron is very unevenly distributed, and it is\r\non a few regions that we must depend for all the future.\r\n\r\nBefore we can calculate how much iron we have we must understand that\r\nit is not found in pure form, but mixed with various other substances:\r\nclay, shale, slate, quartz, sulphur, phosphorus, etc. These must all be\r\nremoved, some by washing, but most of them by roasting, or \"smelting,\"\r\nin blast furnaces, after which it is called pig iron. This of course\r\nrequires large quantities of fuel.\r\n\r\nIt is these things and also the position of the ore that must be taken\r\ninto consideration in estimating the amount of iron in the country. If\r\nore yields a large per cent. of iron in smelting, with a small amount of\r\nwaste, it is, of course, far more valuable than if the amount of iron in\r\nevery ton of material taken from the ground is small.\r\n\r\nIn all minerals, the relation of supply to price is marked. The cost of\r\nlabor and of power is exactly the same whether ore yields fifty-five\r\ntons of pure iron to the hundred, or whether it yields only thirty tons,\r\nbut the price received is little more than half.\r\n\r\nSo if the price is low, it may cost more to mine and smelt the one\r\nhundred tons of earth than will be paid for the thirty tons of iron that\r\nthe low-grade ore would yield. So the lands that produce only thirty\r\ntons to the hundred will never be mined till the price of iron is so\r\nhigh that it is above the cost of producing--that is, till it can be\r\nworked at a profit.\r\n\r\nThe Lake Superior iron found in Minnesota is usually more than\r\nfifty-five per cent. pure iron. That is, if a hundred tons of earth be\r\nmined, more than fifty-five tons of pure iron would be obtained from it.\r\nThis is the highest grade of ore. Some ore is mined that yields only\r\nforty tons or less. There are vast quantities, billions of tons, of iron\r\nore in the United States, that would yield less than thirty tons of iron\r\nto the hundred. These low-grade ores and the ones known to lie so deep\r\nin the earth that the cost of mining them is more than the finished\r\nproducts of iron, are classed as \"not available,\" that is, they can\r\nnever be profitably mined under present conditions. But we must remember\r\nthat as the higher grade ores are exhausted it will become necessary to\r\nuse the lower grades, and that prices will steadily advance as a result.\r\n\r\nIron is sometimes found almost directly under the ground, at other times\r\ndeep in the earth. That which is found just below the surface is, of\r\ncourse, mined much more easily, more safely, more cheaply, and with far\r\nless loss than that which requires deep mining. Such conditions are\r\nfound in the Lake Superior region, and there is almost no loss at all,\r\nthe low-grade ores being piled up at one side where they can be easily\r\nreached in case of need.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand some iron mines now in operation are as much as two\r\nthousand feet in depth. In these mines, as in coal mines, pillars are\r\nleft to support the rock above. A roof of the iron ore is often left\r\nalso. The low-grade ore is left in the ground and no effort is made to\r\npreserve it for future use. These constitute the principal waste in iron\r\nmining.\r\n\r\nThe pure iron of the ore is separated by washing out the clays and soft\r\nelements, but the harder substances must be smelted by means of heat. In\r\nthe beginning this was done by charcoal, which is still used in Sweden.\r\nThe latest method is to employ electricity manufactured by water-power,\r\nbut most of the iron smelting in this country has been done by coal.\r\nEvery ton of iron smelted requires its portion of coal for firing. If\r\nlow-grade fuels in gas-producer engines, or water-power can be used it\r\nwill be a great aid in conserving coal.\r\n\r\nIf a limited supply of rather low-grade iron exists near a coal region,\r\nit can often be mined profitably, when, if it be far from an abundant\r\nfuel supply, it must be shipped to distant blast furnaces. The cost of\r\nshipping causes ore containing a small percentage of iron to be classed\r\nas \"not available.\"\r\n\r\nSometimes a large company with many mines has several varieties of ore\r\nof different strength and hardness. If these can be mixed to produce a\r\nmedium grade by adding a small amount of high-grade ore to a large\r\namount of lower grade, the value of the product will be doubled.\r\n\r\nSometimes, too, the by-products can be made extremely profitable by\r\nmanufacturing large amounts when the expense of undertaking the work is\r\ntoo great to be attempted with a small amount. So if iron mines are\r\nowned by a small company much ore may be classed as \"not available\" that\r\ncould be used by a large company. All these things must be considered in\r\nestimating the iron resources.\r\n\r\nThe first smelting of iron ore in this country was done at Lynn,\r\nMassachusetts, in 1645, using the low-grade bog-ores and smelting with\r\ncharcoal from the surrounding forest.\r\n\r\nNow if we look over an iron map of the United States we shall find that\r\nthere are four hundred and eighty blast furnaces, but that only nine of\r\nthem are west of the Mississippi River and most of these are in\r\nMissouri. The greatest of all the iron regions now lies in upper\r\nMichigan and Minnesota. This furnishes eighty tons out of every one\r\nhundred mined in the United States, but the smelting is done along the\r\nsouthern shores of Lake Michigan. The reason for this is that the iron\r\nregion itself is far distant from a cheap fuel supply. Pittsburg,\r\nPennsylvania, has been the great iron city of the United States on\r\naccount of its nearness to great supplies of both coal and iron.\r\nBirmingham, Alabama, is the heart of the great smelting region of the\r\nSouth.\r\n\r\nThe iron is divided into districts as follows:\r\n\r\n(1) The Northeastern, comprising the states of Vermont, Massachusetts,\r\nConnecticut, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Maryland, and Ohio,\r\nsupplies a little more than five per cent. of the iron mined in the\r\nUnited States.\r\n\r\n(2) The Southeastern, containing Virginia, West Virginia, eastern\r\nKentucky, and Tennessee, North and South Carolina, Georgia, and Alabama,\r\ngives us twelve per cent. of our iron.\r\n\r\n(3) The Lake Superior district, containing the northern parts of\r\nMichigan, Minnesota and Wisconsin, supplies more than eighty per cent.\r\n\r\n(4) The Mississippi Valley district contains western Kentucky, and\r\nTennessee, Iowa, Missouri, Arkansas and Texas. This region furnishes\r\nless than half of one per cent. of the total supply.\r\n\r\n(5) The Rocky Mountain district contains Montana, Idaho, Wyoming,\r\nColorado, Utah, Nevada, New Mexico, Arizona, western Texas, Washington,\r\nOregon and California; and all this great region now supplies but a\r\nlittle more than one per cent.\r\n\r\nThe official report, which is as thorough as can be made but is\r\nnaturally subject to mistakes, gives the amount of available iron, that\r\nis, that which can be mined under present conditions, as nearly five\r\nbillion tons.\r\n\r\nLet us see how long this may be expected to supply the demand.\r\n\r\nBefore 1810 the amount of iron ore produced was so small as to be\r\nscarcely worth considering. From 1810 to 1870 a little less than fifty\r\nmillion tons were mined, from 1870 to 1889 nearly 154,000,000 tons, and\r\nfrom 1889 to 1907, 475,000,000 tons, or altogether nearly 680,000,000\r\ntons. The production has been found to double itself about every nine\r\nyears. In 1907 alone it was 52,000,000 tons or about one-thirteenth of\r\nall that has been mined.\r\n\r\nIn 1880 we used 200 pounds of pig-iron for every man, woman, and child\r\nin the country; in 1890, 320 pounds; in 1900, 390 pounds, and in 1907,\r\n696 pounds. According to the rule of increase, by 1916 we shall be using\r\n104,000,000 tons a year; by 1925, 208,000,000, and by 1934, 416,000,000\r\ntons, and if the same rate of increase should continue, by 1940 we\r\nshould have required for our use in the meantime, six billion tons. But\r\nwe have less than five billion tons of what is now classed as available\r\nore, which means that before that time (when the school-boys of to-day\r\nare business men) we should have exhausted all our good and cheap ore,\r\nand be obliged to depend only on the low-grade ores, the cost of which\r\nwill be very great.\r\n\r\nUnlike coal, the forests, and the soil, there is no great and entirely\r\nuseless waste of iron. But the uses of iron are so many and so varied,\r\nand the supply of high-grade ores which can be cheaply mined is so small\r\nin proportion to the needs of the future, that we should in all ways\r\nlessen the drain on it by substituting other cheaper and more plentiful\r\nmaterials when possible.\r\n\r\nThe chief use of iron is for the carrying of freight. Here are some\r\nfigures given by Mr. Carnegie. Moving one thousand tons of freight by\r\nrail requires an eighty-ton locomotive and twenty-five twenty-ton steel\r\ncars, or five hundred and eighty tons of iron and steel to draw it\r\nover--say an average of ten miles of double track with switches, frogs,\r\nspikes, etc., which will weigh more than four hundred tons. Thus we see\r\nthat to move a thousand tons of freight requires the use of an equal\r\nweight of iron. The same freight may be moved by water by means of from\r\none hundred to two hundred and fifty tons of metal, so that if freight\r\nwere sent by water instead of by rail the amount of iron needed for this\r\nservice would be reduced at least three-fourths, the amount of coal\r\nwould be reduced not less than half, and at the same time the coal used\r\nin extra smelting would be saved. No single step open to us to-day would\r\ndo more to check the drain on both iron and coal than the use of our\r\nrivers for carrying heavy freight.\r\n\r\nThe next great use of iron is for buildings and bridges. The greatly\r\nincreasing use of cement and concrete is reducing this and will reduce\r\nit still further. Cement is made from slag, or the refuse of iron\r\nore--the clays and shales--and the cost of this valuable product is\r\nlittle more than the former cost of piling it away. By making the\r\nuseless slag into cement the cost of iron production is lowered and at\r\nthe same time the drain on the iron is lessened.\r\n\r\nA large use of steel of the highest quality is for battleships, cannon,\r\nand war supplies. If the great nations of the world would agree to\r\nreduce their armament, one of the great drains on the world's iron,\r\ncoal, and wood supply would cease, and these materials be put to\r\nimproving the world.\r\n\r\nThe worst feature of it is that these war supplies are continually\r\nchanging. They must be of the latest pattern, or they are of small value\r\nfor fighting purposes. The construction of battleships differs greatly\r\nyear by year, and the older ships are discarded to make place for newer\r\nand larger ones. It is said that our newest battleship alone could with\r\na few shots destroy all of Admiral Dewey's fleet. The following is from\r\na recent magazine article:\r\n\r\n\"It is admitted by naval officers that the ships of ten years ago are of\r\nobsolete type and would be useless against the new vessels. It is\r\nadmitted that within ten years or less the new types will in turn become\r\nobsolete, and will be useless against the type of vessel certain to be\r\nevolved. That is, as soon as a vessel costing millions of dollars leaves\r\nthe docks, she enters into active competition for a place on the junk\r\npile.\"\r\n\r\nThe greatest improvement that can be imagined in the iron situation will\r\nbe in the discovery and use of alloys or mixtures of iron with other\r\nmaterials. Steel, the strongest of all forms of iron, is an alloy of\r\niron and carbon, and for various purposes these are further mixed with\r\nnickel and silicas. Many other alloys have been discovered within the\r\nlast few years, and each makes possible new uses for iron requiring\r\ngreater strength. One of the best of these is a mixture of iron and\r\nsilicon, called ferro-silicon. Silica is one of the cheapest and most\r\nabundant materials of all the earth's products, so its combination with\r\niron will greatly lengthen the life of the iron supply; and it is\r\nprobable that in the future combinations of other materials will yield\r\nbetter and cheaper metals than any thus far produced.\r\n\r\nThe amount of metal which can be reworked is constantly increasing. Most\r\nof the iron factories remelt large quantities of old iron, to be used\r\nwith the new, and this will lessen each year the demand on the ores. It\r\nis also possible that new deposits of iron ore will be found and these\r\nwill greatly increase the supply. But from the whole iron situation we\r\nmay draw the following conclusions:\r\n\r\nFirst, the amount of iron remaining in the ground is very uncertain. It\r\nmay be more, or it may be less, than the present estimate.\r\n\r\nSecond, if the estimates are nearly correct, and if the present rate of\r\nincrease continues, all the high-grade ores will be exhausted by the\r\ntime the small boys of to-day are the business men of the nation.\r\n\r\nThird, the best methods of reducing the drain on the supply are, (a) The\r\nuse of old iron as a mixture; (b) Carrying a part of the freight by\r\nwater to reduce the amount of iron required by the railroads; (c) The\r\nlarger use of concrete and cement to take the place of steel in\r\nbuildings; (d) Lessening the amount used for war; (e) The use of alloys.\r\nThis opens a large and promising field for invention. (f) More care in\r\npreserving articles made of iron. This is a practical thing for every\r\nperson in our country to do. Every farm implement, or tool, that stands\r\nout in the rain or is left without shelter during the winter, every\r\narticle carelessly lost or broken, has its part in making conditions\r\nworse. All that are well cared for help to make the iron supply last a\r\nlittle longer.\r\n\r\n\r\nREFERENCES\r\n\r\nIron and Steel at Home and Abroad.

Most of these, however, are found in\r\ncomparatively small quantities and have few uses.\r\n\r\nThe minerals which are in constant use by nearly all people and that are\r\nfound abundantly in the United States, are gold, silver, copper, lead,\r\nzinc, and the elements used in manufacturing building materials.\r\n\r\nGold is valuable chiefly because it has been made the standard of money\r\nvalue of the world. Africa produces one-third of the world's supply,\r\nnext come the United States and Australia, producing almost equal\r\namounts, Russia and Canada each produce a limited amount, and various\r\nother countries together produce about one-sixteenth of the whole. (In\r\nthe statements of the gold supply of the United States the territory of\r\nAlaska is included.)\r\n\r\nGold is not found alone but contained in quartz rock or sand. The method\r\nof taking gold from the rock is first by blasting, and afterward\r\ngrinding the rock in a stamp mill, which reduces it to powder, after\r\nwhich the gold is separated by refining processes. The gold which occurs\r\nin the sand, gravel, or clay soil, is washed out. When done on a small\r\nscale this is called \"panning.\" The larger operations of this kind are\r\ncalled \"placer\" and \"dredge\" mining. There is also a considerable amount\r\nof gold obtained as a by-product from copper mining.\r\n\r\nGenerally speaking, quartz mines are in the mountains and placer mines\r\nin the river valleys. Placer mining by powerful water pressure, called\r\nhydraulic mining, destroys the banks, and also fills up the river beds\r\nwith masses of rock and gravel. Some of the large rivers of California\r\nhave been made unfit for steamboat traffic, and serious damage has been\r\ndone to the harbor of San Francisco. For this reason hydraulic placer\r\nmining has been stopped by law. This has greatly lessened the gold\r\nproduction of California.\r\n\r\nIn 1907, the United States produced $94,000,000 worth of gold. Of this,\r\nColorado produced more than any other state. Next in their order come\r\nAlaska, California and Nevada. Each produced from $15,000,000 to\r\n$20,000,000 worth. Together they furnished nearly four-fifths of the\r\nentire supply. The remaining one-fifth comes from Utah, South Dakota,\r\nMontana, Arizona, Idaho, and Oregon, with very small amounts from the\r\nsoutheastern states, the two Carolinas and Georgia, New Mexico,\r\nWashington, and Wyoming. South Dakota has the most profitable single\r\ngold mine in the United States. It has produced nearly $60,000,000 in\r\ngold, and is now turning out about $5,000,000 worth a year.\r\n\r\nThe United States has many unworked gold mines, \"gold reserves\" they are\r\ncalled, whose value can not in any way be exactly estimated. The value\r\nof the placer mines can be better judged than that of the lode or quartz\r\nmines. The placer mines are chiefly in Alaska and California. These\r\nmines may yield gold to the amount of a billion dollars. There are\r\nlesser, but important resources of placer gold in Montana, Idaho, and\r\nOregon.\r\n\r\nThe placer gold mined in 1907 was valued at $24,000,000, and it is\r\nthought that about this quantity can be supplied for a long time.\r\n\r\nThe amount of gold yielded in the reduction of copper ores was about\r\n$5,500,000. It is probable that this amount will be gradually increased,\r\nand can be relied on to last many years. From the lead ores a little\r\nover $2,000,000 worth of gold was taken. This will probably slowly\r\ndecrease for the next ten or twenty years. From gold and silver-bearing\r\nquartz mines $55,000,000 was taken.\r\n\r\nNo calculation can be made as to the amount of gold contained in quartz\r\nmines. New discoveries are always probable and many new mines are opened\r\nup each year, but their value can only be estimated as the work in them\r\nprogresses.\r\n\r\nJust how long they will last nobody knows, but it would seem that their\r\ndecline is far off. The government report says, \"Unless very important\r\nnew discoveries are made it is thought unlikely that the production of\r\ngold in the United States will rise much above $110,000,000; nor is it\r\nlikely that it will sink below $60,000,000 within a long period of\r\nyears.\"\r\n\r\nThe amount of gold used in the United States is about equal to the\r\nproduction. Nearly $80,000,000 is coined into money, and about half as\r\nmuch is used in the arts,--that is, for jewelry, tableware, in\r\ndentistry, in bookbinding, and various chemical processes. The quantity\r\nused in the arts has doubled since 1900. In 1907 the stock of gold coin\r\nin the United States, according to the Director of the Mint, was\r\n$1,600,000,000, which is almost exactly one-fifth of the gold coin of\r\nthe world.\r\n\r\nThe production of gold is rapidly increasing. Since 1850 we have mined\r\nthree times as much gold as in all the previous time since the\r\ndiscovery of America. Such rapid production greatly shortens the life of\r\nthe gold supply. When the gold fields of southern Africa were first\r\nopened they were said to be inexhaustible; but they have been mined so\r\nrapidly, and the supply has proved so far short of the first excited\r\nestimates that experts say that the entire region will be almost\r\nexhausted within twenty years. The loss of gold in mining and refining\r\nis comparatively small. In extracting gold from the cheaper ores the\r\npercentage of loss is large; but as only a small part of the gold is\r\ngained in this way the total loss is relatively small. By other methods\r\nninety-five per cent. or more is saved. In many cases the loss is too\r\nsmall to be considered.\r\n\r\nUnlike other minerals little gold is destroyed by use. It is melted and\r\nremelted, all scraps are used, even the sweepings from the mint and from\r\nmanufacturing goldsmiths' shops are saved and the gold used. The waste\r\nof the world's gold and silver would be much greater but for the use of\r\npaper money, bank checks, and notes. Their very general use keeps the\r\ngold as a reserve, held in banks and storage vaults much of the time. If\r\nit were in constant use, the continual rubbing together of the coins\r\nwould mean a no less steady, though slight, wearing away of their\r\nsurface. This is very noticeable in old silver coins, which are kept in\r\nmore constant circulation.\r\n\r\n\r\nSILVER\r\n\r\nThe conditions in regard to silver are entirely different from those of\r\nthe other resources. The production of silver is not increasing, in\r\nfact, the mining of silver alone is decreasing and the reason is not\r\nbecause the supply is lessening, but because the price is too low to\r\nmake a larger working of the mines profitable, and the supply is kept\r\ndown to the level of the demand. A great number of silver mines have\r\nbeen closed for the last few years. The production could be greatly\r\nincreased at any time to meet an increased demand.\r\n\r\nThe highest production was in 1902, but there have been only slight\r\nchanges since 1895; the production being a little less than 60,000,000\r\nounces, or about one-third of the world's supply--Mexico being the only\r\nother great producer. In many countries with a small supply the output\r\nis growing less each year on account of the low price, and the\r\ndifficulty of competing with the United States.\r\n\r\nThe states now producing the most silver are Colorado, Montana, and\r\nUtah; each of these produces about one ounce out of every five ounces\r\nmined. Most of the remainder was produced by Nevada, Idaho, Arizona, and\r\nCalifornia.\r\n\r\nAlthough nearly 60,000,000 ounces were mined in 1907 only one and a half\r\nmillion ounces were mined for the sake of the silver alone. The rest was\r\nobtained as a by-product in the mining of gold, lead, copper and zinc,\r\nor, as is often the case, it was distinctively silver ore, but could not\r\nbe profitably mined unless some other ore could be obtained at the same\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nThe richer regions seem to have been exhausted, and as the process of\r\nextracting the ore is expensive the lower grade ores will probably be\r\nheld for several years till prices advance. A great silver region has\r\nrecently been opened in northern Canada. This contains immense\r\nquantities of very rich ore, and will probably keep the price down for\r\nmany years.\r\n\r\nSo the care and conservation of silver is not an important issue for the\r\npeople of the present generation. As silver is now obtained largely as a\r\nby-product, there is almost no waste.\r\n\r\nThe United States sends considerably more than half of its silver to\r\nother countries, principally to India and China, which use much silver\r\ncoin, but have little in the way of silver resources. The amount used at\r\nhome is divided between coinage and manufacture. The quantity coined\r\nvaries greatly from year to year, eight million ounces being about the\r\naverage. For manufacturing, jewelry, tableware, chemicals, etc., about\r\ntwenty million ounces, of which one-fifth is remelted silver, are used.\r\nThe demand for silver in manufacturing has doubled since 1898, and may\r\nlead before many years to the reopening of the silver mines.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOPPER\r\n\r\nThe conditions of copper mining are exactly opposite from those of\r\nsilver. The Indians used almost no metal except copper, and for three\r\nhundred years white men used the old Indian mines and refined the copper\r\nby Indian methods. Better methods of mining copper and extracting it\r\nfrom the ores have been employed for the last fifty years, but within a\r\ndozen years the refining of copper has been revolutionized by electric\r\nmethods. An enormous amount has been produced, but production has been\r\nkept down on account of the high prices. It is said that if the price\r\ncould be reduced one-half, ten times as much copper would be used. Most\r\nof the uses of copper have arisen in the last twenty-five years. Its\r\ngreatest use is for electric wiring. Nothing can take its place, and the\r\nuse is increasing astonishingly.\r\n\r\nCopper is used largely in alloys. Bronze is an alloy of copper and tin,\r\nand its use has greatly increased in castings, fittings for buildings,\r\ntablets, and statues.\r\n\r\nA much more useful alloy is brass, made from copper and zinc. Brass is\r\nvery extensively used for parts of machinery, engines, automobiles, and\r\nalso for fittings for buildings. Sheet copper is used for sheathing for\r\nships, for boilers, and for various chemical processes carried on by\r\nelectricity or by acids. Very many of these processes have been\r\ndiscovered within ten or fifteen years, and have largely increased the\r\nuses for copper. One of the older uses of copper which is less common\r\nnow was for cooking utensils. Copper is used by the government for\r\ncoining one-cent pieces.\r\n\r\nNo single country compares at present with the United States in the\r\nproduction of copper, but if reports be correct there is enough copper\r\nin central Africa to supply the world for years to come. Next to the\r\nUnited States, Spain mines the largest amount at present, and Japan\r\nranks next.\r\n\r\nFor many years the rate of increase was enormous. In 1845, 224,000\r\npounds were mined; in 1888, 226,000,000 pounds. Eight years later, in\r\n1896, it had doubled; after another ten years, in 1906, it had doubled\r\nthat quantity, and reached 918,000,000 pounds. In 1890 we were using\r\nthree pounds of copper for every man, woman and child in the country.\r\nAnd in 1907, six and one-half pounds.\r\n\r\nMichigan, Montana, and Arizona produce the bulk of the copper. Utah,\r\nCalifornia, Colorado, New Mexico, Wyoming, and Nevada each produce\r\ncopper in amounts ranging from the 66,000,000 pounds mined in Utah to\r\nthe 2,000,000 pounds mined in Nevada. It is probable that the use will\r\nnot increase so rapidly in the near future. Much old copper will be\r\nremelted.\r\n\r\nThere are large areas of copper lands which are now classed as\r\n\"available\" with copper at about its present price of thirteen cents a\r\npound. If the world production should grow so great as to cause a\r\ndecided drop in the price, much that is now considered available could\r\nnot be mined at a profit, and the copper supply from this country would\r\nbe greatly reduced. If, on the other hand, copper should rise to fifteen\r\nor twenty cents or higher, the amount of available copper land would be\r\nvastly increased. The report on the Conservation of Mineral Resources\r\nsays in effect: \"The copper resources of the United States are believed\r\nto be large enough to allow for a number of years for a demand\r\nincreasing at the rate of 30,000,000 pounds a year. Should this demand\r\ncontinue for a long period the scarcity would be felt and result in a\r\nrising price, which would open up a market for these low-grade ores and\r\nalso cause the use of other metals, like aluminum, to take the place of\r\ncopper whenever possible.\"\r\n\r\nThere is no great waste in the mining of copper, but in the extraction\r\nof copper from the ore the waste is often as much as thirty per cent.,\r\nand it is not easy to avoid this on account of the chemical changes that\r\ntake place.\r\n\r\n\r\nLEAD\r\n\r\nThe United States produces about one-third of the lead in the world. The\r\nremainder comes from Spain, where the production remains about the same\r\nfrom year to year; from Germany, where in spite of higher prices\r\nproduction is growing less; and from Australia and Mexico, in both of\r\nwhich the supply is rapidly decreasing.\r\n\r\nThese facts show that the lead resources of the United States will be\r\ndrawn on heavily in the future. The production of the United States\r\nincreased from about 70,000 tons in 1880 to 365,000 tons seventeen years\r\nlater, and if continued the yearly production by 1920 will amount to\r\n580,000 tons, or more than a billion pounds.\r\n\r\nThe principal lead-producing states are Missouri, Idaho, Utah, and\r\nColorado. In Missouri it is probable that the present rate of increase\r\ncould be kept up for at least fifty years. The other states could keep\r\nup the present production for many years but could not greatly increase\r\nit without exhausting the supply.\r\n\r\nAs with most mineral resources in the United States, it is only the\r\nrichest ores that are now drawn upon (except where lead is a by-product\r\nextracted with some other ore). If prices would advance, so as to make\r\nthe low-grade ores profitable, the amount of our resources would be\r\ngreatly increased.\r\n\r\nThere is little waste in the mining or smelting of lead ores, and the\r\nslag, the waste, is always ready to be used again. In the refining and\r\nconcentrating of lead the loss often amounts to as much as fifteen per\r\ncent. or twenty per cent. The best way to prevent final loss is to store\r\nall refuse until such time as the reworking becomes profitable.\r\nImprovement in methods has been great in the last fifteen years but more\r\neconomical methods everywhere will be one of the necessities of the\r\nfuture. We can see that the lead resources of the United States are not\r\nlarge and that when our own supply is exhausted we can not turn to the\r\nrest of the world.\r\n\r\nThe waste in mining is not large, and most of it can not be avoided at\r\npresent prices; so that for the conservation, which we see is so\r\nimportant, we must turn to the uses of lead. The most necessary of these\r\nis for lead pipes in plumbing. Another use is for war supplies, which\r\nnot only makes heavy drains on our stores of coal and iron, but also on\r\nlead, which is much less plentiful.\r\n\r\nOne ton out of every three produced in the United States is used in the\r\nmanufacture of white lead and consumed as paint. This, of course, is\r\nentirely lost, and it seems that some other material might be used,\r\ninstead of so valuable a mineral, especially when the resource is not\r\nabundant. White lead is used more than any other substance for paint,\r\nalthough zinc white has come into considerable use in the last few\r\nyears. No other nation uses lead paint to such an extent as does the\r\nUnited States, partly because no other nation could afford so general a\r\nuse of such an expensive material, and partly because so many wooden\r\nbuildings are erected. By using brick, stone, or cement, of which we\r\nhave practically an unending supply, to take the place of wood, our\r\nstore of which is rapidly disappearing, we could avoid much of the drain\r\non our mineral resources which are used for paint.\r\n\r\nAs production and price advance a greater quantity of lead is remelted.\r\nAbout 25,000 tons are returned to use each year.\r\n\r\n\r\nZINC\r\n\r\nZinc is a whitish metal. It is used in galvanizing iron to prevent its\r\nrusting. It is used also in the manufacture of white paint, which\r\nconsumes about one ton out of every six tons mined. This, of course, is\r\npermanently lost, but the price and its value as a resource is much\r\nlower than lead. This takes more than half of the entire product. The\r\nremainder of the output is about equally divided between brass and sheet\r\nzinc. All these uses are extremely necessary and it is believed that the\r\nproduction of zinc will rapidly increase for many years.\r\n\r\nThe United States is the largest producer, Germany ranks second. Large\r\namounts are mined in Australia, and very large deposits, entirely\r\nundeveloped, are said to exist in Africa. In 1880, the United States\r\nproduced 23,000 tons of zinc; in 1907, 280,000 tons. This indicates the\r\nrapid rate at which we are increasing our use of zinc.\r\n\r\nIf the same rate should continue, in 1920 we should be using 475,000\r\ntons, or almost a billion pounds, and if zinc oxide should take the\r\nplace of white lead in painting to the extent that now seems probable,\r\nthe quantity would be still further increased.\r\n\r\nMissouri is by far the heaviest producer of zinc, having a little more\r\nthan half of the output. New Jersey ranks next, then Colorado, Wisconsin\r\nand Kansas. Some of the other western states each produce small amounts.\r\nMost of the pure zinc ore is mined at a depth of from one hundred and\r\nfifty to two hundred and fifty feet and occurs in sheets, but a large\r\npart of the ore is a by-product obtained from the reduction of other\r\nores. In New Jersey the zinc alone is found in a single region, where it\r\nwas estimated a few years ago that there were eight million tons, of\r\nwhich two and a half million tons have been mined since 1904. The zinc\r\nin Missouri, Wisconsin and Kansas is found alone or underlying lead\r\ndeposits, while that of the western states is almost always found in\r\nlimestone, and is mixed with silver, copper, lead, and, more rarely,\r\ngold. In these states there has been little attempt to discover zinc; in\r\nfact, ores containing zinc have been rather shunned because of the\r\ndifficulty in extracting them.\r\n\r\nIt is thought that our resources of zinc, especially in the West, have\r\njust begun to be developed, and that the supply, even at the present\r\nrate of increase and at present prices, will last many years. However,\r\nwith increasing use for the product, we can not be sure of supplies for\r\nmore than a generation; and in view of the importance of zinc it becomes\r\nnecessary to inquire into its wastes.\r\n\r\nIn no mineral is the waste more startling than in zinc. In Missouri it\r\nis necessary to leave supporting pillars as in coal mining. This can not\r\nbe remedied, as the use of timbers is too expensive, but it causes a\r\nheavy loss. In the West, owing to the expensive treatment and shipment,\r\nmuch of the low-grade ore is left in the ground. In refining the loss is\r\nenormous, often as much as forty per cent. In order to produce zinc at a\r\nlow cost there must be a heavy loss of metal. Better plants and\r\nequipment for refining, and the saving of all refuse for later use will\r\nbe necessary if we are to conserve the zinc supply for future\r\ngenerations.\r\n\r\n\r\nMISCELLANEOUS\r\n\r\nThe supplies of many of the materials used in buildings and bridges,\r\nsuch as stone, gravel, clay, cement and lime are so great that they\r\nappear inexhaustible, and need of care in their use is not so much to be\r\nconsidered as is their development to take the place of other resources.\r\n\r\nIn the past they have not been used freely because wooden buildings have\r\nbeen so much cheaper; but cement, concrete and brick are now\r\nmanufactured much more cheaply, on account of improved methods, while\r\nthe price of lumber has been increasing rapidly. Within the last ten\r\nyears, the value of cement manufactures has increased nearly six times.\r\nIn 1900 we used seventy pounds of cement for each person; in 1907, two\r\nhundred and twenty-eight pounds. The value of brick and other products\r\nmade from clay has doubled in the same period and is now $160,000,000,\r\nwhile the value of building-stone quarries is three times as great as it\r\nwas ten years ago. There are many reasons why these materials should\r\ntake the place of wood; as they are stronger, more durable, do not\r\nrequire paint, and are so much less liable to loss by fire.\r\n\r\nThe waste of minerals used in building is due to improper and reckless\r\nmethods of taking them from the ground and preparing them for market and\r\nin careless methods in manufacturing.\r\n\r\nOf such minerals as quartz, grindstone, millstone, emery stone, mineral\r\npaints, talc and salt, there seems to be enough to meet the needs of the\r\nfuture as well as the present. Such supplies as sulphur, asphalt,\r\nmagnesia, borax, and asbestos, as well as coal and iron, are not very\r\nplentiful. If used carelessly, they will be exhausted in a few years; if\r\nwisely, they may be expected to last beyond the limits of the present\r\ncentury.\r\n\r\nOur supplies of quicksilver, antimony, graphite, mica, tin, nickel,\r\nplatinum, and many minerals less well known, as well as our petroleum,\r\nnatural gas, copper, gold, silver, lead, zinc, and phosphate rock will\r\nbe almost exhausted well within the present century unless large new\r\ndeposits are discovered.\r\n\r\n\r\nREFERENCES\r\n\r\nReport of National Conservation Commission.\r\n\r\nThe Conservation of Mineral Resources.

This is, of course, a more\r\nconcentrated form of food, and much less of it is needed to sustain\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nFor the plentiful supply of vegetable food we must depend upon the\r\nfertility of the soil, as we have seen. Our animal food can not be\r\nclassed among our natural resources, but as a product of them, and\r\nrequires the same care and wise use.\r\n\r\nIn the early history of our country natural animal food was abundant.\r\nFishes swarmed in the sea, lakes, and streams. Wild turkeys and other\r\ngame birds, deer, and bison formed a large part of the food of our\r\nforefathers. But these have been gradually disappearing. We have caught\r\nand destroyed so many fish that we have only a fraction of our former\r\nnumber. The game birds have disappeared either because they have been\r\nkilled in great numbers or because their nesting-places have been\r\ndestroyed. Of the big game nothing is now left except in a few remote\r\nregions, and it is growing less plentiful each year.\r\n\r\nAlthough large quantities of fish and game are marketed every year at\r\ncertain seasons, they form a small fraction of the animal food required\r\nin the country, and we must now depend for most of our animal food, not\r\non that which was at first given us for a natural resource but on that\r\nraised by man.\r\n\r\nThe poultry--the chickens, ducks, geese and turkeys; the cattle, beef\r\nand dairy, the hogs and the sheep that are raised in such vast numbers\r\nhave taken the place of wild game. The cultivated varieties have higher\r\nfood value, and are far more satisfactory, since they are ready for use\r\nat any time.\r\n\r\nThe conservation of our animal food resources presents a different\r\nproblem from any other. It is true that we have wasted and exhausted our\r\nnatural food supplies, but we must remember that to a certain extent\r\ntheir preservation was neither possible nor desirable. They have been\r\ndriven out by advancing civilization.\r\n\r\nWild birds and animals leave as the forests are cut out, destroying\r\ntheir natural homes. Many of them can not be kept in captivity, so this\r\nsupply never could have been regulated. It was necessary to destroy\r\nsome of them to insure man's safety, and others were needed for his use.\r\nBut we can take their places with other animals which are better fitted\r\nfor our food, and it is the task of keeping up a sufficient supply of\r\nthese on the most suitable land and under conditions that will yield the\r\nbest results, that constitutes the problem of the conservation of our\r\nanimal food resources.\r\n\r\nThe raising of poultry and live stock on a large scale is a separate\r\noccupation, usually followed in a scientific manner and it is not of\r\nthat industry that we need to speak, but rather of the benefit to every\r\nfarmer and to the dwellers in small communities, of raising at least a\r\npart of the animal food used by the family.\r\n\r\nEvery farm has some bits of unoccupied land that can be fenced off for\r\npoultry. The gleanings from the fields will supply their food, and they\r\nwill furnish meat and eggs for the family throughout the year, with\r\nenough left to sell to provide other comforts.\r\n\r\nLive stock, cattle, sheep and hogs, as well as goats, horses and mules,\r\nare profitable to every farmer. Many farms have woodland; land that\r\noverflows at some seasons, and so is unfit for raising crops; or some\r\nrocky unproductive land where stock can be raised more profitably than\r\nanything else, and if every farmer would use all the land not suitable\r\nfor farm crops for pasture land the problem of an abundant meat supply,\r\nof dairy products and of fertilizers to enrich the soil would be largely\r\nsolved. Some farming experts advocate letting each field in turn be used\r\nfor pasture every five years, because the stock raised on it is equal in\r\nvalue to any other farm crop, and because the rest and fertilization\r\nalmost double the value of the succeeding year's crop.\r\n\r\nIn the West and Southwest there are large tracts of public land\r\nuntilled. Much of the land can never be used for agricultural purposes,\r\nbecause it is arid or mountainous.\r\n\r\nThis land is well adapted to grazing and the government has allowed free\r\nuse of it to stockmen as pasture lands.\r\n\r\nThese public pasture lands are called \"ranges.\" In the early years when\r\nthis part of the country belonged to Mexico, the ranges were traversed\r\nby Indians and Mexicans who tended the herds of wild cattle and horses,\r\nraised mostly for their hides. But in the last quarter of a century the\r\nbusiness has fallen into the hands of Americans who have introduced\r\nbetter breeds of higher value. In California, Arizona, and New Mexico\r\nthere are now on the open ranges eight million sheep, nearly three\r\nmillion cattle and nearly a million horses, worth much more than one\r\nhundred million dollars. Wyoming and Utah have great sheep ranges and\r\ndo much to keep up the wool supply. On Texas, with its great cattle\r\nranges, we depend for a large part of our beef and leather. In all these\r\nstates where stock is fed on public land, there are many questions as to\r\nownership of animals, rights of rival rangers, and other points to\r\nsettle.\r\n\r\nIn some of these states the government has set aside national forest\r\nreserves. Within these is much good grazing land. In order that the\r\ngovernment may have some revenue from the land, a regular price has been\r\nset on these forest lands. The charge is forty cents a year each for\r\nhorses, thirty-five cents a year for cattle, and twelve cents for sheep.\r\nThe land is properly divided, so that each kind of stock has suitable\r\npasture. Each person who pays this tax is given a certain range and no\r\none else is allowed to use it. There is sufficient pasture for each so\r\nthat it need not be too closely cropped. A man may lease the same range\r\nyear after year, may put down wells to supply his stock, live on it, and\r\ndo many things to improve it.\r\n\r\nThe forest rangers who patrol the forest to watch for fires or for\r\ntimber thieves also protect these stockmen in their rights and prevent\r\ntrouble about grazing privileges.\r\n\r\nOutside the forest reserves the grazing is free, but the advantages\r\noffered by this system are so great that nearly all rangers now wish to\r\nuse the forest reserves.\r\n\r\nAs each ranger has his land assigned to him and no one else can use it,\r\nthe grass is not overcropped as it often is in regions outside the\r\nforests. If pasture is good, so many herds are pastured there that soon\r\nthe grass is all trampled down and eaten off. Large areas are so badly\r\ninjured that it will not naturally resod itself.\r\n\r\nCattle men are asking that the same rules that apply to the national\r\nforests be applied to other public lands, so that the pasturage may be\r\nimproved and each man may have protection in his rights.\r\n\r\nIf all grazing lands could be thus leased, it would give the business a\r\nfar more permanent character, better breeds of stock would be raised,\r\nand individual owners would direct their efforts to improving both stock\r\nand pasture, after the manner of stock raisers on private lands.\r\n\r\nSo large a part of our animal food, our wool, our leather and many\r\nsmaller needs depend on this industry, that every effort should be made\r\nto encourage it, and to provide the wisest laws and best methods both\r\nfor conserving and developing it.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion it is interesting to note that the Department of\r\nAgriculture is making a study of food birds and animals in various parts\r\nof the world, and trying to domesticate them, to add to the variety of\r\nour food supply. The quail, the golden pheasant and some species of\r\ngrouse among birds, and two or three species of deer, including the\r\nreindeer, appear to be adapted to domestic life in this country, and\r\nmay, before many years, become a part of the animal industry of the\r\nUnited States.\r\n\r\n\r\nFISHERIES\r\n\r\nOne who has never seen the big catches of fish brought in by a mackerel\r\nfleet or visited a wholesale fish market can have little idea of the\r\nimportance of that industry, nor of the immense amount of food that is\r\ntaken from the waters of the United States every year.\r\n\r\nThe word fish is made to include not only fish proper, but oysters,\r\nclams, scallops, lobsters, crabs, shrimps, and turtles. Fish is liked by\r\nmost persons, is more easily digested than meat and is nourishing. As a\r\nfood resource, it is different in many respects from any other. It does\r\nnot exhaust the soil, nor take from the earth anything of value, the\r\nfood of fishes consisting of water plants and animals that are not used\r\nby man in any other way. Fish also purify the water in which they live,\r\nand so cause a great, though indirect, benefit.\r\n\r\nIt is so plainly the wise thing, then, to keep our rivers stocked with\r\nfish and to use them for food only, that it seems that this valuable\r\nresource has been more seriously and unnecessarily wasted than any\r\nother.\r\n\r\nFish are wasted on inland streams in the following ways: (1) By\r\ndynamiting. If a charge of dynamite be exploded on the bed of the river,\r\ngreat numbers of fish, killed by the shock, rise to the top of the water\r\nand can be taken. This practice was quite common at one time, but is now\r\nprohibited by law in several states.\r\n\r\n(2) By seining. A seine or net is placed entirely across the stream, and\r\nall the fish which come down the stream are caught. In several states\r\nseining is not allowed at all. In others it is allowed only at certain\r\nseasons. And in still others the meshes of the seine must be large\r\nenough to allow all fish below a certain size to slip through.\r\n\r\n(3) By catching with a hook, (angling) more fish than can be used or\r\ncatching small fish and then throwing them away. This is a very common\r\ncustom among sportsmen, but should be prohibited by law. From a certain\r\nsmall inland lake, it is said that during the entire season an average\r\nof five thousand fish a day is taken. These are almost all caught by\r\nsummer residents, and it is unlikely that a large per cent. of them are\r\neaten. In a few years the lake will be exhausted, and will cease to\r\nfurnish fish for the people of the community, and there will, of course,\r\nbe no more fishing for the sportsmen. Equal waste is going on all\r\nthrough the summer at every resort where good fishing is to be had. Some\r\nstates have laws regulating the size of the fish that may be caught and\r\nthe number that one person may take in one day, and all states should\r\nhave such laws.\r\n\r\n(4) The worst waste of our fish is caused by turning large quantities of\r\nsewage or refuse from factories into streams. All the fish for miles up\r\nand down a river are often destroyed in this way. As we have seen, this\r\nis only one of the bad results of allowing such refuse to drain into\r\nstreams; every state should have strict laws prohibiting it.\r\n\r\nFrom the waters of the New England states more than five hundred and\r\ntwenty-eight millions of fish are taken each year. Here are the great\r\ncod, mackerel, and herring fisheries. From the Middle Atlantic states,\r\nthe great region for oysters, lobsters and other sea food, come eight\r\nhundred and twenty million more; one hundred and six million come from\r\nthe South Atlantic states; one hundred and thirteen million, including\r\nthe much sought tarpon and red snappers, come from the Gulf states; two\r\nhundred and seventeen million are caught in the Pacific states,\r\nincluding the great salmon catches; ninety-six millions are taken from\r\nthe Mississippi River and its tributaries, and one hundred and sixty-six\r\nmillions, largely salmon, from Alaska. The Great Lakes, with their\r\npickerel, and other fine fresh-water fish furnish one hundred and\r\nthirteen millions and the small inland waters at least five millions\r\nmore.\r\n\r\nWhen they are taken from the waters the 2,169,000,000 pounds of fish\r\ncaught in the United States are worth $58,000,000, but by canning,\r\nsalting, and other processes of preserving, the value is greatly\r\nincreased.\r\n\r\nFortunately, there is a method of conserving our supply of fish and not\r\nonly preventing it from growing less, but of greatly increasing the\r\nnumber and improving the quality. The United States government has a\r\nthoroughly well organized fish commission, and many states and counties\r\nand even private clubs carry on the same work, which is a general\r\nsupervision of the fish supply.\r\n\r\nThe government maintains stations which are regularly engaged in\r\nhatching fish, keeping them until the greatest danger of their being\r\ndestroyed is past, and then placing them in various streams all over the\r\ncountry. These fish are always of good food varieties, and are carefully\r\nselected to insure the kind best suited to the stream, as to whether it\r\nis warm or cold, deep or shallow, clear or muddy, fresh or salt, slow\r\nand placid, or swift and turbulent, for each kind of stream has certain\r\nvarieties of fish that are especially adapted to it.\r\n\r\nWith all these things taken into account, stocking only with the best\r\nfood varieties, if a state has laws which require that a stream be kept\r\nfree from sewage and refuse, that no tiny fish be taken from the water,\r\nand that only a stated number can be taken in a day by a single person,\r\nhundreds of small streams, ponds and reservoirs all over the country may\r\nbe made to yield food supplies for the entire community near by.\r\n\r\nGovernor Deneen, of Illinois, in urging that streams be improved for\r\nnavigation, says, \"No estimate of the benefits to flow from stream\r\ndevelopment would be complete without allusion to the fisheries which\r\nhave been established on the Illinois River, largely by restocking with\r\nfish from hatcheries. The fisheries located on that stream are second in\r\nvalue only to those of the Columbia River.\r\n\r\n\"Our experience thus far indicates that the food resources of the water\r\nmay be brought up in value to those of the land. The Illinois valley\r\ncontains 80,000 acres of water area and yields a fish product worth ten\r\ndollars an acre each year, very nearly all profit. The average value of\r\nthe land product near by is a little less than twelve dollars an acre,\r\nand the labor, cost of seeding, and exhaustion of fertilization of the\r\nland must all be counted before there can be a profit.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1908 the United States Fish Commission distributed nearly two and a\r\nhalf billion of young fish and half a million fish eggs. These were such\r\nexcellent varieties as salmon, shad, trout, bass, white fish, perch,\r\ncod, flat fish and lobsters.\r\n\r\nThe Bureau of Fisheries has its fish-hatching stations, its boats for\r\ncatching fish in nets and its tank cars for carrying the young fish and\r\neggs to the streams that are to be stocked.\r\n\r\nSome of the most important work is interestingly described in a history\r\nof the Bureau of Fisheries issued in 1908. Among other things it tells\r\nof the lobster industry in both the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans.\r\nLobsters are not found naturally in the Pacific, but shipments of\r\nlobsters have been made from the Atlantic coast. At the last shipment,\r\nafter carrying them across the continent packed in seaweed, more than a\r\nthousand lobsters were safely placed on the bed of the Pacific Ocean.\r\n\r\nOn the Atlantic coast the lobsters were rapidly disappearing when the\r\nwork of artificial \"planting\" of young lobsters and eggs began. The\r\nresults can be seen now, for more lobsters are being caught each year,\r\nand the price to users is growing less as the supply becomes more\r\nplentiful.\r\n\r\nThe shad and the salmon are considered the finest of all fish for\r\neating. Both are salt-water fish and both have the habit of going some\r\ndistance up fresh-water rivers to lay their eggs. No eggs are ever laid\r\nin salt water. The mother fish goes up beyond where the tide comes in,\r\nso that the baby fish may have fresh water, which is necessary for them.\r\nSalmon and shad are never caught in the sea, but in the rivers, where\r\nthey go in large numbers to lay their eggs in the spring. This, of\r\ncourse, means the destruction of both fish and eggs,--the present and\r\nfuture supply.\r\n\r\nShad eggs, or roe are sold in large quantities. The Bureau of Fisheries\r\nhas planted three thousand millions of young shad in streams along the\r\ncoast, and the eggs from which these fish were hatched were all taken\r\nfrom fish that had been caught for market, and would have been totally\r\nlost if the Bureau had not collected them from the fishermen.\r\n\r\nShad have been planted in the Sacramento and Columbia Rivers flowing\r\ninto the Pacific Ocean. From these two sources they have spread until\r\nnow they are found as far south as Los Angeles, and as far north as\r\nAlaska, a coast line of 4,000 miles, and it is said that more shad could\r\nnow be caught in the Sacramento and Columbia Rivers than in any other\r\nwater courses.\r\n\r\nIn addition to supplying the streams with young fish, it is necessary to\r\nleave a part of each river clear so that some of the fish may find their\r\nway up-stream to deposit their eggs. The salmon have been almost driven\r\nout from the waters of New England, except in the Penobscot River, where\r\nthey have been kept by the watchfulness of the Fisheries Bureau. It is\r\nbelieved that the entire salmon industry in Maine would be wiped out in\r\nfive years if fish culture should cease, and in the West, where the\r\ndrain on the salmon for canning purposes is so heavy, artificial\r\nplanting is used very largely to keep up the supply.\r\n\r\nThe experiments with oysters are full of interest. In Chesapeake Bay,\r\nwhere the best natural oyster beds were found, the demands on them were\r\nso great that the supply began to fail. In 1904 only a little more than\r\none-fourth as many were produced as in 1880. The natural oyster beds\r\nwere then marked and set aside as public fishing grounds.\r\n\r\nThese are to be used by whoever wishes but under strict protective\r\nrules. All other ocean beds may be planted with oysters by any one who\r\nleases the privilege from the state, and the right to collect the\r\noysters from a certain bed belongs to the person who leases it as fully\r\nas does property on land.\r\n\r\nLouisiana had a small number of natural beds. About ten years ago the\r\nplanting of oyster beds began, and soon 20,000 acres had been planted.\r\nConditions were particularly favorable, and within two years after the\r\neggs or spawn were placed it was found that oysters three and a half to\r\nfour inches in size had grown in quantities of 1,000 to 2,000 bushels\r\nper acre. For a long time it has been the custom of fishermen to fatten\r\ntheir oysters by transplanting them to new beds where the food is\r\nabundant, and in a short time the oysters are much plumper, it takes\r\nfewer of them to make a quart and they also sell at a higher price,\r\nbecause they are of the finest quality.\r\n\r\nThese rich food beds are not plentiful, and many dealers are compelled\r\nto put small oysters on the market. The Bureau of Fisheries has made a\r\nstudy of these food beds, and by using fertilizer, such as farmers use\r\non their land, have been able to make such beds of sea-plants grow where\r\nthey do not naturally exist. These experiments have been tried only a\r\nshort time, but the results have been entirely satisfactory, and it is\r\nhoped that before long, rich oyster beds may be made to grow in any part\r\nof the ocean where oysters will thrive.\r\n\r\nIn the Great Lakes the fishing is so heavy that it is probable that the\r\nsupply of perch and white fish would be very low by this time if\r\nfish-culture had not been carried on to so great an extent. White fish,\r\nlake trout, pike and perch may be hatched in such large numbers as to\r\nkeep the fisheries up to their present yield.\r\n\r\nAnother important work of the Fisheries Bureau is to keep up the supply\r\nof cod for the great fisheries on the New England coast. For the last\r\ntwenty years profitable shore cod fishery has been kept up on grounds\r\nthat had been entirely exhausted before and also where cod had never\r\nbeen found before. At the wharves, government officers from the\r\nFisheries Bureau board the fishing boats when they come in and take the\r\neggs from the fish. These are taken to the government hatchery and\r\neither the eggs or the young fish are put back into the sea, and so keep\r\nup an unending supply.\r\n\r\nAlaska is one of the most important fishing regions of the world. For\r\nthis entire Territory, the United States paid Russia $7,200,000 and many\r\nthought that the money was practically thrown away, since it apparently\r\nbought for us nothing but barren, ice-bound shores. But since it became\r\na part of the United States, Alaska has yielded fishery products alone\r\namounting in value to $158,000,000--twenty-two and a half times the\r\nprice paid. Of this, $49,000,000 came from the fur seal fishery,\r\n$86,000,000 from salmon and $23,000,000 from other fish.\r\n\r\nAbout $1,500,000 worth of sponges are now taken from Florida waters each\r\nyear. Naturally the failure of the industry would be a serious loss to\r\nthe state. But the natural sponge beds are being rapidly exhausted, and\r\nthe Bureau of Fisheries is convinced that the continuation of the sponge\r\nfisheries must depend on artificial planting. Sponges can be produced\r\nfrom cuttings at a cost much less than that of taking them from the\r\nnatural beds.\r\n\r\nRhode Island has been successful in cultivating soft-shell clams and in\r\nincreasing the area of its clam beds.\r\n\r\nThe Mississippi and its branches are subject to great floods in the\r\nearly spring and occasionally in summer. After these floods millions of\r\nfishes are left in small pools some distance back from the river. These\r\npools gradually dry up; the larger fishes are caught and the smaller\r\nones die. The state and National Fish Commissions are now collecting\r\nthese fishes in large numbers, and using them to stock ponds and rivers\r\nin other parts of the country.\r\n\r\nThey are used to supply many parts of the West and South and there is\r\nmuch greater demand for them than the Commissions can meet. Not that\r\nthere is a lack of fish, for millions are left to waste because the\r\nCommissions can not distribute them rapidly enough to save them. If\r\nlarge storage ponds could be established to collect and keep the fish\r\nduring the flood season, so that all the time might be spent in\r\ncollecting fish during the overflow, and they could be sent out later,\r\nthe amount of fish saved would be increased many fold.\r\n\r\nThe fish thus saved are being made to serve another useful purpose.\r\nPearl buttons are made from the shells of mussels or fresh-water clams.\r\nThis business, which is now worth $5,000,000, can not last many years\r\nunless some means of increasing the supply of mussels can be devised.\r\n\r\nNow these men, who are always studying new plans, have thought of a\r\nwonderful way in which to let the fish help in carrying on this work.\r\nThey obtain the mussel eggs, and when they are hatched place them in the\r\npools with the fish from the overflowed lands. The tiny mussel larvæ\r\nattach themselves to the fish and are carried to the rivers and ponds\r\nwith the fish. Soon they are ready to drop to the bottom and find food\r\nfor themselves.\r\n\r\nIn this way 25,000,000 mussels were carried last year to streams where\r\nmussels are known to thrive. If these mussel-bearing fish can be\r\nobtained by farmers having private fish ponds, the ponds can be drained\r\neach year and the mussels gathered, thus adding considerably to the\r\nowner's income, and also keeping up the pearl button industry, in\r\naddition to the food supply which he gains from the fish.\r\n\r\nEnough has been said to show clearly how desirable and how possible it\r\nis to conserve and increase our fish supplies. With the coöperation of\r\nall who waste the fish at present, and those who might aid in stocking\r\nthe streams, we could add greatly to the food supply of the nation at a\r\nless cost than in any other way.\r\n\r\n\r\nREFERENCES\r\n\r\nGrazing Lands.

In the same way nature adjusts itself in its various\r\nparts. Before man enters a region, the balance is perfect. Plants crowd\r\neach other out of the way, the weaker giving place to the stronger; then\r\ninsects come to destroy them. These insects are destroyed by birds,\r\nsmall mammals or other insects. The birds are killed by animals and\r\nother birds, which in turn are the food of larger animals. And so\r\nthrough all nature runs this law of balance; nothing increases in too\r\ngreat a proportion.\r\n\r\nBut when man comes, he thinks only of his own needs and wishes and\r\nbegins at once to upset the delicate balance. Year after year, he plants\r\nlarge fields of a single crop, and, calling other plants weeds, because\r\nthey hinder the growth of his grain, he drives them out entirely. The\r\ninsects that feed on these plants, finding no food, soon disappear,\r\nwhile the ones which feed on the farmers' crops, finding food so\r\nplentiful, are able to increase in great numbers. They increase all the\r\nmore rapidly because man, not knowing or not caring to know who his real\r\nhelpers are, has killed and driven away the birds that would feed on\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nIn order to readjust matters, he must learn how to destroy the insects,\r\nor he can not have crops. Both the plant enemies, the weeds, and the\r\ninsects are always trying to bring about nature's balance again by\r\ndriving out the over-abundant field crop, so he must constantly fight\r\nthem in order to secure his harvest.\r\n\r\nIn no country is more harm done by insects than in the United States.\r\nThe losses to live stock and to plants, both growing and stored,\r\nresulting from insects are greater than all the expenses of the National\r\nGovernment, including the pension roll and the yearly maintenance of the\r\narmy and navy.\r\n\r\nImmense as is the value of our farm products, it would be much greater\r\nif it were not for the work of these insects. Careful calculations\r\nindicate that this loss will amount to not less than the enormous sum of\r\n$1,100,000,000 annually and probably far more. The loss is usually\r\nestimated at ten per cent. of the crop, but often is much heavier than\r\nthis, and many indirect losses are not taken into account in this table,\r\nthough we shall speak of them later.\r\n\r\nMost insects pass through four stages: (1) the egg; (2) the worm or\r\nlarvæ; (3) the chrysalis, cocoon, or pupa; (4) the full-grown insect or\r\nimago. Butterflies, moths and beetles are examples of insects in this\r\nlast stage.\r\n\r\nAs eggs, they are, of course, harmless, and during the chrysalis state\r\nthey lie perfectly inactive and are harmless, but many of them are very\r\ndestructive when they are worms or larvæ, others do most injury in the\r\nfull-grown state.\r\n\r\nThe insects that man has most reason to dread are: (1) Plant-lice, tiny\r\ninsects with soft bodies, usually green. They attach themselves to the\r\nstems and leaves of plants and suck their juices, leaving them to wilt\r\nand die. They are found on many kinds of plants--on corn, wheat and\r\nother grains. They also flourish on garden vegetables and flowers.\r\n\r\n(2) Scale insects. These are flat and appear to be only a scale on the\r\nstem or fruit. They are usually covered with a hard crust-like covering\r\nand are found on trees and bushes. They are usually the color of the\r\nbark on which they are found.\r\n\r\n(3) Worms and caterpillars are soft-bodied, the bodies being in\r\nsegments, and either smooth or covered with short bristly hair. They\r\nspend nearly all their time in eating, and do immense damage to the\r\nfoliage of trees and vegetables and to fruit. The adult is a moth or\r\ncaterpillar. This class is among the farmer's worst insect enemies.\r\n\r\n(4) Borers attack trees and tough-stemmed plants. The eggs are laid on\r\nthe stems, and after hatching, the larvæ bore into the stem or under the\r\nbark, causing the foliage to wilt and die. We are all familiar with what\r\nwe call \"worm-eaten\" wood, with canals that have been eaten by these\r\nborers running through it in all directions. This completely ruins some\r\nof the best forest trees for lumber, and makes one of the greatest\r\nlosses of the forests.\r\n\r\n(5) Beetles are insects in the adult state. They have hard, shiny\r\nwing-covers. Many of the borers are beetles, and there are other\r\nvarieties which do great damage, though other kinds are useful to man in\r\ndestroying harmful insects.\r\n\r\n(6) Bugs have their mouth parts prolonged into a sharp beak with which\r\nthey puncture the skin or bark, instead of chewing the leaves, as do\r\nbeetles. Flies, gnats, and other similar insects do not usually injure\r\nvegetation so much as do some other classes of insects, the principal\r\ndamage being done to fruits; but they have been found to be the cause of\r\nsome of the most serious diseases in both man and the lower animals.\r\n\r\nThe Department of Agriculture divides the injuries done by insects into\r\nclasses according to the products injured, and in the list they place\r\nfirst the injury done to cereal crops.\r\n\r\nThe insects which damage the corn crop most seriously are the corn-root\r\nworm, which feeds on the roots of young corn, causing it to fall over\r\nand die, and which sometimes takes the whole corn crop of a large\r\nregion. The next most important is the boll-worm or ear-worm. Most\r\npersons have seen this worm in the ears of sweet corn; ninety ears out\r\nof every hundred contain a worm which destroys from one-tenth to\r\none-half the corn. Some years every ear in large regions is infested. In\r\nthe South the field corn is attacked as badly as the sweet corn, but in\r\nthe great corn states the injury is much less. Even here, however, the\r\ntotal loss is very great.\r\n\r\nAlmost equally important is the damage wrought by the chinch-bug, which\r\nis also one of the greatest pests in wheat and oats.\r\n\r\nEvery year in different sections of the country, bill-bugs, wire-worms,\r\ncutworms, cornstalk borers, locusts, grasshoppers, corn plant-lice and\r\nother insects, destroy millions of bushels of corn.\r\n\r\nOf the cereal crops, wheat suffers most from insects. Of the large\r\nnumber of insects that attack wheat, the three important species are the\r\nHessian fly, the chinch-bug and the grain plant-louse or green-bug.\r\n\r\nThe Hessian fly has been known to destroy as much as sixty per cent. of\r\nall the wheat acreage of a state. Fortunately, this damage is done early\r\nin the year, so that when whole fields are destroyed they can be\r\nreplanted with other crops and only the cost of seed and labor is to be\r\ncounted as a loss. But more often the field is only partly destroyed by\r\nthe fly; it is not necessary to replant, but the yield is small, often\r\nnot more than one-third. Some years the loss from the Hessian fly is\r\nvery heavy, at other times comparatively light, yet there are few years\r\nwhen the loss is less than ten per cent. of the total crop from this\r\ninsect alone,--which meant last year a loss of 72,500,000 bushels.\r\n\r\nThe chinch-bug is responsible for the loss of five per cent., or one\r\nbushel out of every twenty. It attacks the straw, causing the heads of\r\nwheat to fall over and wither away.\r\n\r\nThe injury done by the green-bug comes just as the wheat begins to\r\nripen, the tiny green creatures attaching themselves in great numbers to\r\nthe heads of the wheat. Other insects which prey on the wheat crop are\r\ngrasshoppers, the wheat midge, cutworms and army-worms.\r\n\r\nIf it were not for the attacks of these various pests the wheat crop\r\nwould be at least one-fifth larger than it is. Instead of 725,000,000\r\nbushels, it would be 870,000,000; which, with wheat at a dollar a\r\nbushel, amounts to a loss of nearly $150,000,000. Further, the world\r\nloses all this valuable bread-stuff.\r\n\r\nOats, rye and barley suffer far less than wheat from insect ravages but\r\nthey are all attacked by the same insects, and on the whole, much damage\r\nis done to them each year.\r\n\r\nHay, clover, and alfalfa have their enemies which destroy a considerable\r\npart of the crops. The locusts and caterpillars, the army-worms and\r\ncutworms are the best known, but the tiny leaf-hoppers, which spring up\r\nat every step as we walk across the path or lawn, and the web-worms and\r\ngrass-worms and grubs which work about the roots of the plants all do\r\ntheir part in lowering the production.\r\n\r\nThe principal insect enemies of cotton are the cotton boll-weevil, the\r\nboll-worm, the cotton red spider, and the cotton-leaf worm. The control\r\nof the boll-weevil is considered one of the most serious problems\r\nconfronting the agricultural men of the country. In the first years\r\nafter its introduction, it reduced the cotton crop fully fifty per\r\ncent., and was the cause, not only of serious loss to the farmers, but\r\nof the closing of the cotton mills in New England, of a scarcity of\r\ncotton cloth and a decided rise in its price. The boll-weevil is a\r\nbeetle about a quarter of an inch in length. This little beetle eats\r\ninto the heart of each boll, which soon falls to the ground.\r\n\r\nThe cotton-leaf worm formerly caused heavy damage, as much as\r\n$20,000,000 to $30,000,000 a year, but the loss has been greatly reduced\r\nby the war which farmers have waged against it. It is still estimated at\r\nfrom $5,000,000 to $10,000,000.\r\n\r\nThe boll-worm is chiefly destructive in the Southwest and does damage to\r\nthe extent of $12,000,000.\r\n\r\nAll in all no article of commerce is more seriously affected by insect\r\nravages than cotton, on account of its necessity, and the fact that it\r\ncan be raised only in certain regions.\r\n\r\nTobacco is one of the principal crops in several states and it suffers\r\nheavily from insect damage. The large, showy tobacco-worm and the tiny\r\ntobacco-thrips cause serious injury to the leaves.\r\n\r\nSugar-cane has its insect enemies which take on an average one stalk out\r\nof every ten raised in this country, and reduce the crop in the same\r\nproportion.\r\n\r\nThe cranberry is another valuable commercial plant that has been greatly\r\naffected by an insect known as the cranberry fruit worm, but by\r\nspraying, growers have been able to reduce the damage from sixty per\r\ncent. down to fourteen per cent.\r\n\r\nGarden vegetables suffer more than anything else from insects. Potatoes\r\nare attacked by two species of insects, both destructive unless held in\r\ncheck. One is the reddish brown blister-beetle. The eggs are laid on the\r\nground, and do not become adult insects until the second year. The other\r\nis the striped Colorado beetle, the eggs of which are laid on the under\r\nside of the leaves, and develop into adults in a short time. Two broods\r\nof this beetle develop in a single season. Thus it may be seen that the\r\ntwo are entirely different, though they are often supposed to be the\r\nsame. The Colorado beetle, by the immense damage it was doing to a\r\nnecessary food crop, first led to a regular method of fighting insects\r\nin this country. This potato-bug is not feared as it was in the past,\r\nsince farmers have learned to control it in a great measure, but they\r\nhave only been able to lessen the evil, never to drive it out\r\ncompletely.\r\n\r\nOther insects that destroy garden vegetables are the well-known green\r\ncabbage-worm, the harlequin cabbage-bug, the cabbage hairworm, the\r\nasparagus-beetle, the squash-bug, the squash-vine borer, the striped\r\ncucumber or melon beetle, the melon aphis, the corn boll-worm, the\r\ncornstalk borer and many others.\r\n\r\nIn addition to these insects that attack special plants, all vegetables\r\nare preyed on by the grub-worm, the cutworm, the aphis and various tiny\r\nhoppers.\r\n\r\nThe grub-worms which work about the roots of plants are, in the adult\r\nstate, the June-bugs or cock-chafers which fly about our lights in the\r\nspring and early summer, and which themselves do considerable damage by\r\neating leaves of trees and bushes.\r\n\r\nOrchards and small fruits suffer heavily from insect pests, both on\r\naccount of the direct loss and on account of the expensive treatment.\r\nThere are several hundred insects which ravage fruit trees, attacking\r\nthe roots, trunk, foliage and fruit.\r\n\r\nAmong these are the scales, of which there are many species, but of\r\nwhich the most widely known and dreaded is the San Jose scale, so called\r\nbecause San Jose, California, was its starting place in America. It is\r\nthe only one of the scales which, if not checked, will, in two or three\r\nyears, completely destroy the tree on which it feeds. It attacks the\r\ncitrus fruits, orange, lemon, grape-fruit, and the apple, pear, and\r\npeach as well as small fruits, particularly currants.\r\n\r\nAmong the many varieties that do serious damage are the black olive\r\nscale, plum scale, hickory scale, locust scale, frosted black scale, red\r\noak scale, the cottony maple scale, greedy scale and oyster shell\r\nscale.\r\n\r\nThe woolly aphis injures the roots of our fruit trees; the trunk and\r\nlimb borers, the peach tree borer, the apple borer, all stand ready to\r\nassail the life of the entire tree. The various leaf worms attack the\r\nlife of the tree also. The grape-leaf skeletonizer eats every particle\r\nof green from the leaves, leaving only the veins. The canker-worms and\r\nthe destructive tent-caterpillars also cause the death of many fruit\r\ntrees.\r\n\r\nOf insects which attack the fruit, the list is long. The codling-moth of\r\nthe apple causes a greater money loss than any other enemy of fruits.\r\nVarious estimates of the loss have been made, and in general it is\r\nbelieved that it causes the loss of one-fourth to one-half of the apple\r\ncrop of the United States each year.\r\n\r\nThe plum-curculio attacks nearly all stone fruits. Its natural food\r\nplant is probably the native wild plum, and the plum continues to be its\r\nfavorite food, consequently this fruit suffers most from the attacks of\r\nthe insect. In years of short crops very little fruit remains on the\r\ntree to ripen. But peaches, apricots and cherries also suffer heavily,\r\nand apples and pears in a less degree.\r\n\r\nThe insects which injure the hardwood forest trees are principally the\r\nleaf-eaters, such as the gypsy and brown tail moths, which have almost\r\nstripped the New England shade trees, and done great damage to the\r\nforests; the elm leaf beetles and the numerous borers, both beetles and\r\ngrubs, which from eggs laid in or just beneath the bark, hatch into\r\nlarvæ which burrow into the wood, destroying its usefulness for lumber.\r\nAmong the borers which do most injury in destroying valuable timber are\r\nthe hickory-bark beetle, the bark-boring grubs which kill oak, chestnut,\r\nbirch and poplar trees, the locust borer, the chestnut timber-worm and\r\nthe Columbian timber beetle.\r\n\r\nAll these represent the loss from insects to the growing product; but\r\nwhen it is stored, there is seemingly no less danger of attack by a\r\ndifferent class of insects. These include grain weevils and beetles,\r\nflour-moths, the small fruit and vinegar flies, buffalo-moths and dozens\r\nof others.\r\n\r\nAfter these comes the loss to man and animals from insects. The cattle\r\ntick alone, through the dreaded Texas fever, causes a loss of from\r\n$10,000,000 to $35,000,000 in various years. The ox warble also preys on\r\ncattle and causes a loss of probably $3,000,000 more. The buffalo-gnats,\r\ngadflies, and other flies do on the whole a large amount of damage each\r\nyear.\r\n\r\nMan has only discovered in recent years how serious a factor in his own\r\nhealth as well as comfort, is the insect life about him. This subject is\r\nmore fully treated under the subject of health, so for the present we\r\nneed only say that flies, mosquitos and other insects are supposed to\r\ncause some of our most serious diseases, and to be the indirect cause of\r\nthe loss of hundreds of millions of dollars and many human lives each\r\nyear.\r\n\r\nHaving thus summed up the damage done by insects, let us see what may be\r\ndone to prevent their spread and if possible drive out the most harmful\r\nspecies entirely. Unfortunately, that seems almost impossible; so far\r\nall man's efforts have only resulted in saving a larger or smaller\r\nproportion of the various crops each year.\r\n\r\nIn insect control we turn first to the natural means of destruction.\r\nChief among these means are birds,--of which we will speak in another\r\nchapter,--snakes and toads.\r\n\r\nToads live entirely on insects and catch large quantities of them. It is\r\nestimated that a single toad is worth almost twenty dollars a year in a\r\nfield or garden. English gardeners are said to pay high prices for them\r\nand to keep as many as possible in their gardens. Toads will eat almost\r\nany kind of insect, are absolutely harmless, and should be carefully\r\nprotected.\r\n\r\nThere is one class of insects which, so far from being an enemy to man,\r\ncombines with him to kill the harmful insects. Among these are the black\r\nbeetles which feed on cutworms and other larvæ which injure the roots\r\nof plants. Lady-bird beetles destroy large numbers of plant-lice, and\r\nthe Asiatic lady-bird has been found to be the natural destroyer of the\r\nSan Jose scale. These little insects are now being hatched in this\r\ncountry, and it is hoped through them to stamp out the pest. A number of\r\nlarger insects prey on the smaller ones.\r\n\r\nOther insects, such as the Hessian fly, the green-bug or spring grain\r\naphis, the army-worm and various species of grasshoppers are killed by\r\ntiny parasitic insects whose eggs are laid in the bodies of the larger\r\ninsects, but which, after being hatched, feed on them.\r\n\r\nTo these natural methods of control man has added others. Cultivation is\r\none of these methods. As insects flourish when given an unusually large\r\namount of food of a particular kind, and starve when that food is taken\r\naway from them, so rotation of crops proves to be one of the best means\r\nof getting rid of those insects which can not travel far for their food.\r\nFarmers who practise rotation of crops are much less troubled with\r\ninsects that injure the roots of plants than those who do not.\r\n\r\nOne of the best means of preventing damage from the Hessian fly is to\r\nsow a narrow strip of wheat all around the edges of the field several\r\nweeks before the main crop is to be sowed. The flies will gather in\r\nthis strip and lay all their eggs in the early wheat. Just before the\r\nmain crop is sowed, the narrow strip is plowed up and thoroughly\r\nharrowed and the larvæ perish for want of food.\r\n\r\nThe best known means of getting rid of grasshoppers is to destroy the\r\neggs. This should be done by plowing and harrowing all roadsides, ditch\r\nbanks, uncultivated fields and grassy margins around fields in the fall\r\nor winter.\r\n\r\nFall harrowing and deep spring plowing will prevent many of the bugs and\r\nbeetles which spend the larval state in the ground from hatching. This\r\nmethod will also destroy the plum-curculio in orchards.\r\n\r\nIn attempting to control the boll-weevil of the cotton fields, it has\r\nbeen found that the best method to pursue is the simple one of planting\r\nthe crop very early, so that the cotton passes the danger stage before\r\nthe insects emerge, and removing all the plants in the fall.\r\n\r\nWorms that infest fruit can be checked for the following year by fall\r\nplowing in the orchard and by destroying the decayed fruit as it falls.\r\nThe farmer who lets his decayed fruit lie on the ground is preparing for\r\na heavy crop of insects to eat his fruit the following summer.\r\n\r\nFruit and forest trees are both protected by a burlap band or a band of\r\n\"sticky\" fly-paper placed around the tree, to prevent insects from\r\ncrawling up.\r\n\r\nThe use of poison in destroying insects is now the one most generally\r\nand successfully employed by farmers and fruit growers.\r\n\r\nPoisons may be liquid or dry. The liquid is made by mixing with water,\r\nand for large plants and trees is put on with a spray or force-pump that\r\ncarries the poison to every part of the plant.\r\n\r\nSome insects, such as beetles, caterpillars and grasshoppers, chew the\r\nleaves or stems of plants, and the poison may be applied to their food;\r\nbut others, such as plant-lice, scale insects and all bugs suck the\r\njuice, usually from the stem or bark. Poisons must be applied to the\r\ninsect itself to be effectual in this case.\r\n\r\nThese are some of the insect poisons most in use:\r\n\r\nParis green, which will kill all insects that chew the leaves, may be\r\nused in small quantities in gardens by mixing one-half teaspoonful to a\r\ngallon of water, or in large quantities with one pound to one hundred\r\nand fifty or two hundred gallons of water.\r\n\r\nWhite hellebore is used to destroy currant worms and is usually dusted\r\non dry.\r\n\r\nPyrethrum is used as a spray, mixing one ounce to two gallons of water,\r\nto destroy cabbage-worms and many other garden insects. If the dry\r\npyrethrum powder is blown from a bellows into a tightly closed room, it\r\nis said to destroy all the flies.\r\n\r\nBordeaux mixture is made by dissolving four pounds of copper sulphate in\r\nhot water and mixing with an equal quantity of a solution made by mixing\r\nfour pounds of lime with water. This is then mixed with fifty gallons of\r\nwater. Paris green is sometimes added. This mixture is largely used in\r\norchards and for destroying insects on a large scale. It is also useful\r\nfor curing diseases of plants.\r\n\r\nAn excellent spray for orchards both for removing fungous diseases and\r\nscale insects is a home-made lime-and-sulphur solution. Enough for\r\nspraying a large orchard is prepared as follows:\r\n\r\nAdd three gallons of boiling water to fifteen pounds of lime. Then add\r\nten pounds of sulphur and three gallons more of hot water. Allow this to\r\nboil about twenty minutes in its own heat, then add enough water to make\r\nfifty gallons of the mixture. Dilute with water in the proportion of one\r\npart of the solution to seventy-five of water.\r\n\r\nSmall quantities are made by using a fractional part of this recipe.\r\n\r\nWhale-oil soap dissolved in water and used as a spray is an effective\r\nremedy for the San Jose scale.\r\n\r\nKerosene emulsion is used to kill the insects which suck the juices of\r\nplants and trees. It is made by mixing a half-pound of hard soap with\r\none gallon of hot water and stirring into it, so as to mix thoroughly,\r\ntwo gallons of kerosene oil. This may be kept on hand for use, and is\r\nmixed with ten parts of water to one of the emulsion.\r\n\r\nFor use in large orchards force-pumps operated by compressed air and\r\ndrawn by two horses are used. The spraying should be done as soon as the\r\nblossoms drop, and many orchards are sprayed three times in a season,\r\nbut the work should never be done while the trees are in blossom.\r\nVegetables should be sprayed many times through the season.\r\n\r\nA careful study of these methods of control, adapted to the various\r\nplants and the insects which prey on them, with the natural enemies of\r\ninsects encouraged and protected, would go far to prevent the\r\nwide-spread and serious damage now affecting our crops, our vegetables,\r\nour orchards, and our forests.\r\n\r\n\r\nREFERENCES\r\n\r\nCirculars of the Bureau of Entomology.

This work of bird\r\ndestruction has gone on until all the best species are greatly reduced\r\nin numbers and some species have been almost entirely driven out.\r\n\r\nTo see how serious a matter this is we must study the food habits of\r\nbirds, and we shall find that although the different species eat a large\r\nvariety of food, in almost every case their natural food is something\r\nharmful to man.\r\n\r\nThe large American birds, the eagles, hawks, owls and similar kinds, are\r\ncalled birds of prey because they feed on small birds and animals. Some\r\nof these are of the greatest benefit to the farmer, while others are\r\naltogether harmful. Another large class of birds lives almost entirely\r\non injurious insects and this class is entitled to the fullest care and\r\nprotection from the farmer.\r\n\r\nStill another class lives largely on fruits, wild or cultivated, and on\r\nseeds, which may be either the farmer's most valuable grains, or seeds\r\nof the weeds that would choke out the grain.\r\n\r\nIt can not be denied that birds often do serious damage through their\r\nfood habits; but the great mistake that has been made in man's treatment\r\nof birds has been in hastily deciding that if birds are seen flitting\r\nabout fields of grain they are destroying the crop. A better knowledge\r\nof their food habits will lead to proper measures for destroying the\r\nharmful kinds and protecting the useful ones.\r\n\r\nSuccessful agriculture could hardly be practised without birds, and the\r\nbenefit to man, though amounting each year to millions of dollars, can\r\nhardly be estimated in dollars and cents, since it affects so closely\r\nthe size of our crops, the amount of timber saved for use in\r\nmanufactures, and even the health of the people.\r\n\r\nHere again we see the careful balancing that runs through nature; how\r\ncarefully each thing is adjusted to its work. Naturally the balance\r\nbetween birds, insects and plants would remain true, no one increasing\r\nbeyond its proper amount. But when man begins to destroy certain things,\r\nand to cultivate others, this balance is seriously disturbed. The birds\r\nthat destroy weed seeds being killed, weeds flourish in such vast\r\nnumbers as to drive out the cultivated crops. The birds which destroy\r\nmice, moles, gophers, etc., being killed, these animals become a\r\nnuisance and cause serious losses. If insect-destroying birds are driven\r\nout, the farmer will be at the mercy of the insects unless he employs\r\ntroublesome and expensive methods of getting rid of them. Certain\r\nfavorable conditions cause large numbers of birds to gather in a small\r\nregion and they become a pest. Very careful observation has shown that\r\nin nearly every case the favorite food of the birds is something which\r\nis not valued by man, and if this food is provided, the farm grains and\r\nfruits will not be seriously molested.\r\n\r\nFew birds are altogether good, still fewer are altogether bad; most\r\nspecies are of great benefit, even if at the same time they do some\r\nharm. Some birds do serious damage at one season, and much good at\r\nanother. The most notable example of this is the bobolink, which in\r\nnorthern wheat fields is loved no less for his merry song than for the\r\nthousands of weed seeds and insects he destroys; while in the South he\r\nis known as the reed-bird or rice-bird, the most dreaded of all foes to\r\nthe rice crop.\r\n\r\nFlying down on the fields by hundreds of thousands these birds often\r\ntake almost the entire crop of a district. The yearly loss to\r\nrice-growers from bobolinks has been estimated at two million dollars.\r\n\r\nIf crows or blackbirds are seen in large numbers about fields of grain\r\nthey are generally accused of robbing the farmer, but more often they\r\nare busily engaged in hunting the insects that without their help would\r\nsoon have destroyed his crop; and even if they do considerable damage at\r\none season they often pay for it many times over.\r\n\r\nWhether a bird is helpful or the reverse, in fact, depends entirely on\r\nthe food it eats and often even farmers who have been familiar with\r\nbirds all their lives do not know what food a bird really eats. As an\r\nexample of the misunderstanding that is often found in regard to birds,\r\nwhen hawks are seen searching the fields and meadows, or owls flying\r\nabout the orchards in the evening, the farmer always supposes that his\r\npoultry is in danger, when in reality the birds are quite as likely to\r\nbe hunting for the animals which destroy grain, produce, young trees,\r\nand eggs of birds.\r\n\r\nIn order to correct such mistaken ideas the Department of Agriculture\r\nhas made a most careful and accurate study of the habits of birds, and\r\nit is the results of these observations that are recorded here.\r\n\r\nField workers from this Department who have observed the habits of the\r\nprincipal birds that live among men, have watched them all day and from\r\none day to another as they fed their little ones, and, to be more\r\ncertain of their facts, they have examined the stomachs of hundreds of\r\nbirds, both old and young, to learn exactly what each bird had eaten. In\r\nthis way they have proved absolutely that many species that are supposed\r\nto eat chickens, or fruit or grain, in reality never touch them, but are\r\namong the farmer's best friends.\r\n\r\nAmong other things they have learned that while they are feeding their\r\nyoung, birds are especially valuable on a farm. Baby birds require food\r\nwith a large amount of nourishment in it that can be easily digested.\r\nAlmost all young birds have soft, tender stomachs, and must be fed on\r\ninsects; as they grow older, the stomach or gizzard hardens and is\r\ncapable of grinding hard grain or seeds. The amount of food required by\r\nthe baby birds is astonishing. At certain stages of their growth they\r\nrequire more than their own weight in insects. And the young birds are\r\nto be fed just at the season that insects do the most injury to growing\r\ncrops of grain and young fruit and vegetables.\r\n\r\nBirds vary so much in the kind of food eaten, not only by different\r\nvarieties of the same species, but by the same birds at different\r\nseasons, that it is necessary to make a careful study of each bird to\r\nknow whether, if he is sometimes caught eating cultivated fruit and\r\ngrains, he helps in other ways enough to pay for it.\r\n\r\nWhen insects are unusually abundant, birds eat more than at other times\r\nand confine themselves more strictly to an insect diet, so that at such\r\ntimes the good they do is particularly valuable.\r\n\r\nBirds of prey may do harm in a particular place, because in that region\r\nmice, rabbits and other natural food are scarce, and they are driven to\r\nfeed on things that are useful to man, while in places where their\r\nnatural food is plentiful the same birds are altogether helpful.\r\n\r\nIn the same way, birds which naturally eat weed seeds frequently find\r\nthese almost altogether lacking where the farms are most carefully\r\ncultivated, but in their place are fields of grain whose seed also\r\nfurnishes them desirable food. Is it any wonder, then, that, their\r\nnatural food being taken from them, they turn to the cultivated crops?\r\nThe fruit eating birds seem always to choose the wild fruits, but where\r\nthese are not to be had they enter the orchards and soon become known as\r\nenemies of the farmer.\r\n\r\nA careful examination of the harm done by birds leads to the belief\r\nthat the damage is usually caused by a very large number of one species\r\nof birds living in a small area. In such cases so great is the demand\r\nfor food of a particular kind that the supply is soon exhausted, and the\r\nbirds turn to the products of the field or orchard. The best conditions\r\nexist when there are many varieties of birds in a region, but no one\r\nvariety in great numbers, for then they eat many kinds of insects and\r\nweeds, and do not exhaust all the food supply of one kind. Under such\r\ncircumstances, too, the insect-eating birds would find plenty of insects\r\nwithout preying on useful products, and the insects would be held in\r\ncheck, so that the damage to crops would be slight.\r\n\r\nThe following are examples of the food eaten by birds and the good that\r\nthey thus accomplish to man:\r\n\r\nDuring the outbreak of Rocky Mountain locusts in Nebraska, a scientific\r\nobserver watched a long-billed marsh wren carry thirty locusts to her\r\nyoung in an hour and the same number was kept up regularly. At this\r\nrate, for seven hours a day, a nest-ful of young wrens would eat two\r\nhundred and ten locusts a day. From this he calculated that the birds of\r\neastern Nebraska would destroy daily nearly 163,000 locusts.\r\n\r\nA locust eats its own weight in grain a day. The locusts eaten by the\r\nbaby birds would therefore be able to destroy one hundred and\r\nseventy-five tons of crops, worth at least ten dollars a ton, or one\r\nthousand seven hundred and fifty dollars.\r\n\r\nSo we see that birds have an actual cash value on the farm. The value of\r\nthe hay crop saved by meadow-larks in destroying grasshoppers has been\r\nestimated at three hundred and fifty-six dollars on every township\r\nthirty-six miles square.\r\n\r\nAn article contributed to the New York _Tribune_ by an official in the\r\nDepartment of Agriculture estimated the amount of weed seeds annually\r\ndestroyed by the tree sparrow in the state of Iowa on the basis of\r\none-fourth of an ounce of seed eaten daily by each bird. Supposing there\r\nwere ten birds to each mile, in the two hundred days that they remain in\r\nthe region, we should have a total of 1,750,000 pounds, or eight hundred\r\nand seventy-five tons, of weed seed consumed in a single season by this\r\none species in the one state. In a thicket near Washington, D. C. was a\r\nlarge patch of weeds where sparrows fed during the winter. The ground\r\nwas literally black with the seeds in the spring but on examining them\r\nit was found that nearly all had been cracked and the kernels eaten. A\r\nsearch was made for seeds of various weeds but not more than half a\r\ndozen could be found, while many thousands of empty seed-pods showed how\r\nthe birds had lived during the winter.\r\n\r\nIn no place are birds more important than in the forests, where they\r\nsave hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of valuable timber each\r\nyear. In forests there can be no rotation of crops and no cultivation,\r\nand spraying, which keeps down the insect pests in the orchard, is\r\nimpossible here because of the expense. It would not pay to spray two or\r\nthree times a year a crop of timber that requires a lifetime to grow. So\r\nin the forests the owner must depend entirely on birds for his\r\nprotection. How great the destruction of our forests would be is shown\r\nby the fact that the damage at present is estimated at $100,000,000, in\r\nspite of the fact that a vast army of birds is working tirelessly,\r\nsummer and winter, to devour the insects! The debt of the forester to\r\nthe birds can hardly be estimated.\r\n\r\nA full variety of birds will thoroughly protect a farm and orchard. The\r\nsparrows will destroy the weed seeds; the hawks and kites, flying by\r\nday, will catch the meadow mice and other small mammals, and the owls\r\nwill pounce on those that venture forth at night. Of the insect-eating\r\nbirds, the larks, wrens, thrushes and sparrows search the ground for\r\nworms, eggs and insects under leaves and logs everywhere. The\r\nnuthatches, vireos, warblers and creepers search every part of the tree,\r\nwhile the woodpeckers tap beneath the bark for grubs and worms. The\r\nfly-catching birds catch their insect food on the wing among the trees\r\nand branches, and, last of all, the swallows skim high in the air and\r\ncatch the few insects that rise high above the tree-tops.\r\n\r\nThus each family has its part of the work and the good they do is almost\r\ntoo great to calculate. Without this check it would be impossible for\r\nany green thing to flourish. So vast an amount of food is required to\r\nfeed the great army of insects that the task would be impossible in any\r\nother way.\r\n\r\nA brief description of some of the common birds and their food habits is\r\ngiven here that farmers may know their friends, and that people\r\neverywhere may learn to protect the useful birds and drive out the few\r\nthat do the mischief.\r\n\r\nAll of these observations have been made by field workers from the\r\nDepartment of Agriculture, and no statement has been made that has not\r\nbeen proved by the examination of many bird stomachs at different\r\nseasons.\r\n\r\nHighest of all in the list come the bluebirds. They are among the most\r\nbeautiful of our native birds, with their bright blue coats and soft red\r\nbreasts. They are sweet singers, and are among the first to return in\r\nthe spring to tell us of the return of summer. In addition to this they\r\nhave many good habits and absolutely no bad ones. More than\r\nthree-fourths of their food consists of insects,--beetles, grasshoppers\r\nand caterpillars. The remainder is weed seeds and fruit, but there were\r\nno reports of cultivated fruits being eaten by bluebirds. On the\r\ncontrary they eat the most undesirable of the wild fruit, chokeberry,\r\npokeberry, Virginia creeper, bitter-sweet and sumac, as well as large\r\nquantities of ragweed seeds. Other birds are equally useful but none\r\ncombines usefulness with so much beauty and sweetness of song.\r\n\r\nThe tiny wrens are another class of wholly useful birds. Their food\r\nconsists almost entirely of insects with a very little grass-seed. They\r\nsearch every tree, shrub, and vine for caterpillars, spiders and\r\ngrasshoppers.\r\n\r\nSparrows are almost equally useful. The tree sparrow, song sparrow,\r\nchipping sparrow, field sparrow and snowbird or junco are all great\r\nweed-seed destroyers. Many of them remain throughout the winter, when\r\nthey feed entirely on the seeds of weeds. Each bird eats at least a\r\nquarter of an ounce of seeds per day, and they are often found by\r\nthousands in a region. At least a half dozen varieties of birds are\r\nfeeding in the same ratio all over the country, reducing the crop of\r\nnext year's weeds. During the summer they turn to a diet composed partly\r\nof insects and here again they help the farmer by eating the weevils,\r\nleaf-beetles, grasshoppers, bugs and wasps that infest his crops.\r\n\r\nThe various species of swallows rank high as insect-eating birds. The\r\ntree, bank, cliff and barn swallows and the purple martins all eat small\r\nbeetles, mosquitoes, flying ants and other high-flying insects, and the\r\nnumber destroyed is almost beyond our power to imagine.\r\n\r\nThe most important service performed by swallows, however, is in the\r\nSouth, where they migrate for the winter. There they feed largely on the\r\ncotton boll-weevil, one of the most destructive of all insects, as we\r\nhave seen. The Department of Agriculture is urging strongly that farmers\r\nin the North protect the swallows so that they may winter in the South\r\nin large numbers to feed on the boll-weevil, which, if allowed to\r\nflourish, will affect not only the southern planters, but every user of\r\ncotton goods, and every one who profits in any way by the sale and\r\nmanufacture of cotton goods.\r\n\r\nAmong swallows, the beautiful and graceful purple martin is most worthy\r\nof protection. Both North and South, the swallows are among the most\r\nuseful of all birds to the farmer and fruit grower, and should be\r\nprotected from English sparrows and encouraged in every possible way.\r\n\r\nThe seventeen species of titmice which inhabit the United States, and\r\nmany of which remain all winter, are all insect eaters to a great\r\nextent, eating large quantities of tent-caterpillars, moths and their\r\neggs, weevils, including the cotton boll-weevil, plum-curculio, ants,\r\nspiders, plant-lice, bugs and beetles. They also eat small seeds,\r\nparticularly those of the poison ivy.\r\n\r\nThe bush-tit feeds largely on insects that destroy grape-vines and on\r\nthe black olive scale. Other species eat most of the scales which infest\r\nfruit and forest trees.\r\n\r\nThe rose-breasted grosbeak, while it eats a few green peas, is to be\r\nclassed among the wholly beneficial birds, for it is the great natural\r\ndestroyer of the Colorado potato beetle. In fact, it eats enough\r\npotato-bugs at a single meal to pay for all the peas eaten in a whole\r\nseason. One family of grosbeaks, nesting near the field, will keep an\r\nentire patch cleared of potato-bugs throughout the season. In some parts\r\nof the country the grosbeak feeds largely on the plum scale, the hickory\r\nscale, the locust and oak scales and on the tulip scale, which is very\r\ndestructive to shade trees. The black grosbeak is another variety that\r\ndeserves encouragement in every way, for it eats the chrysalis of the\r\ncodling-moth that is so serious a foe to our apple crop. It eats also\r\nmany other injurious insects, such as wire-worms, many of the most\r\nharmful of beetles, caterpillars, and scales.\r\n\r\nAmong the most useful birds, we must mention the phoebe, which nests\r\nnear houses and lives almost entirely on harmful insects which it\r\ncatches on the wing.\r\n\r\nNight hawks eat flying ants in great numbers, as many as eighteen\r\nhundred having been found in a single stomach. They eat insects that fly\r\nby night and are classed among our most useful birds.\r\n\r\nQuails are almost unequalled as weed-destroyers. Throughout the fall and\r\nwinter they spend the time destroying weed seeds. In summer they eat\r\nColorado potato beetles, chinch-bugs, cotton boll-weevils,\r\nsquash-beetles, grasshoppers and cutworms. The mother quail, with her\r\nfamily of twelve to twenty little ones, patrols the fields thoroughly\r\nfor insects. Quails should be prized as among a farmer's most valuable\r\nhelpers and protected at all seasons.\r\n\r\nSimilar in the good work it does is the meadow-lark. Grasshoppers,\r\ncaterpillars and cutworms form a large part of its diet, and its\r\nvegetable food consists of weed seeds or waste grain.\r\n\r\nKing-birds are useful in protecting poultry and song birds from hawks,\r\nand are also great fly catchers, taking many beetles on the wing.\r\n\r\nDoves eat great quantities of seeds of harmful weeds. They also eat some\r\ngrain, but almost altogether after the crop has been gathered. Old\r\ndamaged corn and single grains scattered along the roads are eaten, but\r\nthere is no complaint of doves doing injury to fields of growing grain.\r\n\r\nThe orioles are beautiful, are sweet singers, and no exception can be\r\ntaken to their food habits. Caterpillars are their principal article of\r\nfood, but plant-and bark-lice, spiders and other insects are also eaten.\r\nOrioles do not eat much vegetable food. They have been accused of eating\r\npeas and grapes, but there seems no evidence to show that this habit is\r\ngeneral.\r\n\r\nThe food habits of cuckoos render them very desirable, since they eat\r\nhairy caterpillars, particularly tent-caterpillars, for which they seem\r\nto have an especial fondness, fall web-worms and locusts, besides other\r\ninjurious insects, but they are accused of bad habits in relation to\r\nother birds, and can therefore hardly be classed among the wholly useful\r\nbirds. Warblers and vireos are among the most helpful birds in an\r\norchard, devouring large quantities of insects.\r\n\r\nThere is no class of birds concerning which it is more necessary that\r\nthe farmer should be well informed, than the hawks and owls, since some\r\nof them are wholly good, and of the greatest possible benefit to him and\r\nthe fruit grower, while others are extremely harmful in their food\r\nhabits.\r\n\r\nThe harmful varieties live almost entirely on poultry and wild birds,\r\nand include the goshawk or partridge hawk and the Cooper hawk, which is\r\na true chicken-hawk and should be recognized by all farmers at sight.\r\n\r\nThe goshawk and chicken-hawk, in the amount of damage done, far exceed\r\nall other birds of prey. The sharp-shinned hawk rarely attacks\r\nfull-grown poultry, but preys heavily on young chickens and song birds.\r\nIn fact, it is known to eat nearly fifty species of our most useful\r\nbirds. There is no question that these birds are a serious pest and\r\nshould be destroyed, but they should not be confused with other members\r\nof the family which are among the best friends that a farmer has in\r\nkeeping his farm clear of small enemies.\r\n\r\nOwls and hawks eat the same class of food, the hawks flying by day and\r\nthe owls by night. Owls remain North in winter, while hawks fly farther\r\nsouth.\r\n\r\nThe small species of both eat large quantities of insects, such as\r\ngrasshoppers, locusts and beetles. The larger ones are the farmer's\r\ngreat protection against the meadow-mouse, the most destructive of all\r\nanimals to farm crops. It tunnels under fields and eats the roots of\r\ngrass, grain and potatoes, eats large amounts of grain and does even\r\nmore damage by girdling young trees in orchards. Rabbits injure trees in\r\nthe same way, often during the winter ruining an entire orchard in this\r\nmanner.\r\n\r\nSquirrels, ground-squirrels, gophers, prairie-dogs, and other small\r\nanimals do serious damage in the course of a year on almost every farm.\r\n\r\nThe rough-leg hawk feeds entirely on meadow-mice, but if the supply\r\nfails, it eats mice, rabbits and ground-squirrels, but in no instance\r\nattacks birds. Its cousin, the ferruginous rough-leg, lives largely on\r\nground-squirrels, rabbits, prairie-dogs and pouched gophers. This\r\nspecies also never attacks birds, and neither do any of the four members\r\nof the kite family.\r\n\r\nAnother large class of birds,--the marsh-hawk, Harris hawk, red-tailed\r\nhawk, red-shouldered hawk, short-tailed hawk, white-tailed hawk,\r\nSwainson hawk, short-winged hawk, broad-winged hawk, Mexican black hawk,\r\nMexican goshawk, sparrow-hawk, barn-owl, long-eared owl, short-eared\r\nowl, great gray owl, barred owl, western owl, Richardson owl,\r\nscreech-owl, snowy owl, hawk-owl, burrowing owl, pigmy owl and elf\r\nowl--live mostly on destructive mammals, insects, frogs and snakes, but\r\nthey eat some birds and some of them occasionally catch poultry. Young\r\nones do much more harm than the full-grown ones, probably because they\r\nfind poultry and birds easier to obtain than other food. These species\r\nall do great good on the farm and in the orchard and if their natural\r\nfood is plentiful and the number of the birds of prey limited, they\r\nshould be allowed to remain, even though they occasionally do harm; but\r\nthey can not be allowed to increase greatly in a region without becoming\r\na nuisance.\r\n\r\nIn another class the golden and bald eagles, pigeon and Richardson\r\nhawks, prairie falcon and great horned owl do considerable harm, and the\r\ngood and bad qualities about balance. In a poorly settled region, where\r\nthere is plenty of natural food, a few of these birds will bring forth\r\nlittle complaint, but in a section where there are few ground-squirrels,\r\nprairie-dogs, gophers, rabbits and woodchucks, where poultry is raised\r\nextensively, and useful birds are numerous they will do great harm and\r\nfarmers will usually want to keep them down entirely.\r\n\r\nThe gyrfalcons, duck-hawks, sharp-shinned hawk, Cooper hawk and goshawk\r\nlive almost entirely on food that is desired by man,--poultry, game\r\nbirds and many varieties of our best insect-destroying birds, and they\r\neat almost nothing that is harmful to man. The numbers of these birds\r\nshould be reduced as much as possible: but in general it may be said\r\nthat the birds of prey--the hawks and owls--are among the most, if not\r\nthe most, valuable birds that are engaged in helping the farmer by\r\ndestroying the natural enemies of agriculture.\r\n\r\nAmong the smaller birds which do much good, but of which complaints are\r\nmade because they eat some fruit and grain are the woodpeckers,\r\nincluding the flickers, cedar-birds, robins, cat-birds, thrashers, crows\r\nand blackbirds.\r\n\r\nThe woodpeckers are the great natural protection of the forests by\r\nwaging constant warfare on the wood-boring insects and ants beneath the\r\nbark where no other birds can reach them. They are equally useful in an\r\norchard except that here man may only at great trouble and expense\r\npartly hold them in check. Downy woodpeckers are also great eaters of\r\nscales, and the fruit grower need not begrudge the red-headed woodpecker\r\na meal of cherries or apples, especially as it will usually be found\r\nthat it is the wormy fruit that is attacked.\r\n\r\nThe flicker or gold-winged woodpecker lives largely on ants, of which he\r\neats immense quantities, seeking them not only in the trees but on the\r\nground.\r\n\r\nRobins are so well loved for their cheery song, for their friendliness\r\nto man, and their red breasts coming as a touch of color in returning\r\nspring, that except where they are present in great numbers, there is\r\nlittle complaint of the fruit they eat, even without taking into account\r\nthe good work they accomplish as insect eaters. In fact only four per\r\ncent. of a robin's food is cultivated and a little less than half of it\r\nis wild fruit not prized by man. The remaining half consists of\r\ncaterpillars, beetles, spiders, snails and earth-worms.\r\n\r\nThe cat-bird is also known as a cherry-eater and he frequently helps\r\nhimself from strawberry and raspberry patches. He eats a larger\r\nproportion of cultivated fruit than the robin, but about twice as much\r\nwild fruit, including the sumac and poison ivy. The cat-bird eats many\r\ninjurious insects, which constitute only a little less than half of his\r\nfood.\r\n\r\nThe cedar-bird is sometimes called the cherry bird, and is accused of\r\nbeing a great cherry-stealer, but an examination of stomachs showed that\r\nonly nine birds out of one hundred and fifty-two had eaten any cherries\r\nand that cherries formed only five per cent. of the food of these few.\r\nThere is even evidence that this bird prefers wild fruits, which form\r\nits principal food though it eats a few insects.\r\n\r\nThe crows and blackbirds are accused of many bad habits, such as pulling\r\nup young corn, destroying large quantities of grain and injuring much\r\nfruit by pecking holes in it which are later entered by insects. Crows\r\neat fruit to some extent, but the greater part of it is wild. Both crows\r\nand blackbirds are accused of robbing the nests of other birds.\r\nBlackbirds are injurious chiefly because they gather in such large\r\nflocks that when they descend on a field they can eat a large amount of\r\ngrain in a short space of time. The greatest good accomplished by the\r\nblackbird is in the spring when it follows the plow in search of\r\ngrub-worms, of which it is extremely fond. It also does much good in\r\ndestroying insects in the early summer, the young birds being fed almost\r\nentirely on insect food until they are grown.\r\n\r\nOf the crow, Doctor Merriam, who is at the head of this branch of work\r\nin the Department of Agriculture, says, \"Instead of being an enemy of\r\nthe farmer, as is generally believed, the crow is one of his best\r\nfriends and the protector of his crops. True, during corn-planting time,\r\nthe crow's bill is turned against the farmer during one month, and one\r\nmonth only is he his enemy. But during the other eleven months the crow\r\nis really working overtime for him. It eats thousands upon thousands of\r\ndestructive insects and bugs every week, and when it comes to feeding\r\nits young, gives them a diet composed almost entirely of worms and\r\ninsects that prey upon the crops.\"\r\n\r\nAnother government report says, \"The crow should receive much credit for\r\nthe insects which it destroys. In the more thickly settled parts of the\r\ncountry it probably does more good than harm, at least when ordinary\r\nprecautions are taken to protect young poultry and newly planted corn\r\nfrom it.\" It is probable that in many parts of the country some farmers\r\nwill find it desirable to reduce the number of crows and blackbirds on\r\ntheir farms.\r\n\r\nThe brown thrasher is a beautiful singer and eats many insects, mostly\r\ninjurious. It eats some cultivated fruits. It also eats a small amount\r\nof newly planted corn, but at the same time clears the field of May\r\nbeetles. Altogether it is a useful bird but not one of the highest\r\nbenefit.\r\n\r\nThere are a few species of birds of which but little good can be said,\r\nand which it may be desirable to attempt to drive out in many parts of\r\nthe United States. Chief of these is the English sparrow. It is of a\r\nquarrelsome disposition and is much given to driving other birds from\r\ntheir nests. In some districts it has completely expelled some of the\r\nmost useful kinds of birds. It exists everywhere in such numbers as to\r\nrender it a nuisance, and it may be said to be the greatest pest among\r\nAmerican birds. Its favorite food is dandelion seeds, and it destroys\r\nmany thousands of seeds, but as the dandelion does no real injury this\r\nhabit does not offset all the harm done. It also eats other weed seeds\r\nbut the greatest thing to be said in its favor is that it feeds on the\r\ncottony maple scale. It is probable that in small numbers the English\r\nsparrow might be classed among the useful, or, at least, one of the only\r\npartly harmful birds, but there is no bird whose numbers it is more\r\ndesirable to reduce.\r\n\r\nThe common blue-jay is accused of some very bad habits, among them\r\neating the eggs and young of small birds. It is a fruit eater and also\r\na grain eater and frequently robs corn-cribs and injures newly planted\r\nfields. However, it eats some insects, mice and other small enemies of\r\nthe farmer and as it is nowhere very plentiful, and does not live in\r\nflocks, there is not much cause for complaint. However, its cousin, the\r\nCalifornia jay, has an extremely bad record. It is a great fruit eater,\r\nand devastates prune, apricot, and cherry orchards. It is a serious\r\nrobber of the nests of small birds and hens, and though it eats some\r\ngrasshoppers and a very few weed seeds, it is thoroughly disliked by\r\nwestern fruit growers. It should be greatly reduced in numbers. Another\r\nCalifornia bird that has gained a bad reputation is the house finch or\r\nlinnet. It does serious harm in the cherry and apricot orchards, not so\r\nmuch by eating as by pecking at the fruit. It probably pecks, and thus\r\ndestroys, five times as much fruit as it eats. As the bird is very\r\nabundant, it sometimes causes the loss of almost the entire crop of a\r\nsmall fruit grower. It does not deserve protection, for it eats the buds\r\nand blossoms of fruit trees and does little to compensate for all the\r\nharm done. Its best habit is eating woolly plant-lice.\r\n\r\nNo article on birds would be complete that does not dwell on the\r\nenormous destruction of birds for trimming hats. As one writer puts it,\r\nwe pay eight hundred million dollars a year for hat trimmings, assuming\r\nthe insect ravages to be due to the killing of our birds for millinery\r\npurposes. While this is exaggerated, it is undoubtedly true that this is\r\nthe largest cause of the destruction of the birds of America.\r\n\r\nThe Audubon society says that we, as a nation, use 150,000,000 birds a\r\nyear for trimming hats alone and that this single item would save our\r\ncrops from insect destruction and largely rid our fields of weeds.\r\n\r\nIf a few hundred dollars are stolen from a bank, the greatest efforts\r\nare made to catch the thief, and if possible to get the money back; but\r\nthe great army of insects destroy each year, almost as much in money\r\nvalue as all the national banks in the country have on deposit, and this\r\nwholesale destruction might largely be prevented if every woman and girl\r\ntook (and kept) a pledge not to use wings, breasts, or birds on her\r\nhats. There is no objection to the use of ostrich feathers, which are\r\ncarefully plucked from the live birds. The feathers grow again, just as\r\nthe wool grows on sheep that have been sheared. Neither is there any\r\nobjection to using the feathers of the barn-yard fowls which are killed\r\nfor food.\r\n\r\nOnly a little less is the loss caused by so-called \"sportsmen,\" men who\r\nkill only for the pleasure of shooting, or who, because they like the\r\ntaste of quail, shoot as many as they can in a day instead of only\r\nenough to satisfy hunger. Often a farmer sells for a very small amount\r\nthe privilege of hunting on his farm, thinking he is making money when\r\nin fact he is losing ten dollars for every one he makes.\r\n\r\nThe quail, sparrows and other birds on the farm are destroyed. As a\r\nresult the weed seeds are not eaten and a big crop comes up in the\r\nspring. In the summer there are no quail on the farm to destroy insects.\r\nThe insects and the weeds together make the crop poorer, and the owner\r\nfeels that farming is growing less profitable, when in fact he has\r\nfailed to take ordinary precautions to obtain a good crop by protecting\r\nthe birds.\r\n\r\nWith the huntsman and his bag of birds we may class the small boy with\r\nhis rifle or sling-shot. A single boy does little harm but all the boys\r\nin the country taken together do a grave amount of damage.\r\n\r\nLast in the list comes the egg hunters, who by robbing nests can kill\r\nfour or five birds at a time, simply for mischief. A party of boys can,\r\nby a day's sport, make a serious difference in the number of birds in a\r\nregion where they are not plentiful and thus have a large share in\r\ndamaging the crops.\r\n\r\nIf, then, birds play so large a part in the welfare of the farm and in\r\nturn in the prices of farm crops, fruit, lumber and cotton cloth, it is\r\nmost desirable that every effort be made to reduce the numbers of\r\nharmful birds and to encourage the useful species.\r\n\r\nMany of the states now have excellent laws for the protection of birds;\r\nbut without a large number of game wardens, it is difficult to enforce\r\nthe laws closely unless the public sentiment is strongly against the\r\nkilling of birds. Laws should be made to protect birds against the egg\r\nhunter, (except for the purpose of study, and then a license should be\r\nrequired), sling-shots should be prohibited, as they already are in many\r\nplaces. All hunters should be required to have a license, the number of\r\nbirds killed by a single person in a single day should be limited, and\r\ncertain birds should always be protected by law. These laws should be as\r\nnearly uniform as possible in all the states and there must be a desire\r\non the part of all the people to see these laws obeyed.\r\n\r\nThe boys and girls should be banded together in the schools or in\r\nsocieties and pledged to protect birds and not to destroy them. The\r\ngirls should pledge themselves not to wear birds for ornament.\r\n\r\nWomen's clubs might do much to popularize the movement for the\r\nprotection of birds, and to that end should try to establish a sentiment\r\namong their members against their use for millinery.\r\n\r\nAll these agencies working together will make a vast difference in the\r\nnumber of birds, and as a result, in the good that they do, but the\r\ngreat work must be done by farmers themselves. They will need to protect\r\nthemselves in certain ways against the harm done by many of the birds\r\nthat on the whole are extremely useful.\r\n\r\nTo protect poultry from owls do not allow it to roost in the trees; to\r\nprotect from hawks, keep the young ones near the house, and if possible\r\ncover their runways with wire netting.\r\n\r\nTo protect against grain eating, use scarecrows or put up a dead crow as\r\na warning. Mixing seed corn with tar so as to coat it will prevent crows\r\nfrom pulling it up at planting time.\r\n\r\nTo protect against fruit eating, plant wild fruits. The best of all\r\ntrees for this purpose is the Russian mulberry, which ripens at the same\r\ntime that cherries do and is particularly relished by all fruit-eating\r\nbirds. If planted in barn-lots, chickens and hogs will eat all the fruit\r\nthat falls to the ground, making it serve a double purpose. The fruit of\r\nwild cherry, elder, dogwood, haws, and mountain-ash are eaten by birds,\r\nand if a farm be planted with such trees and bushes in the barn-yard,\r\nalong the lanes or in some of those unproductive spots that are to be\r\nfound on every farm, birds will be attracted to the farm and will pay\r\nwell for themselves, and the farmer's crop of cultivated fruit will be\r\nprotected. Birds themselves distribute many seeds, particularly of wild\r\nfruits.\r\n\r\nThe farmer who keeps several cats must pay for it in the loss of birds,\r\nfor birds will not nest where they are constantly watched by cats. Boxes\r\nfor martins and other birds, bits of hay, horse-hair and string\r\nscattered about will often encourage birds to build about an orchard or\r\nfarm. A wood-lot, besides paying in other ways, will afford nesting\r\nplaces for a large number of birds. To place a drinking and bathing\r\nplace near the house is one of the best methods of attracting birds,\r\nwhich will use it constantly.\r\n\r\nBy all these methods and a little winter feeding with crumbs, apple\r\npeelings or waste fruit and grain, the farmer will be able to induce a\r\ngood variety of birds to nest on his farm, and will receive in return\r\ngreat protection from the small mammals, insects and weeds that would\r\nlessen the amount of his harvests.\r\n\r\n\r\nREFERENCES\r\n\r\nRelation Between Birds and Insects.

If they were to be\r\nweak and sick, suffering from all kinds of diseases, dying in great\r\nnumbers, all these things would count for little. But men and women, as\r\nthey are learning how to conserve their natural resources, are thinking\r\nfar more than ever before of health and how to keep it. It is necessary\r\nto think of these things, for as people crowd into cities, where they\r\nlive a life different from that which nature intended, sickness and the\r\ndeath-rate increase greatly.\r\n\r\nHealth, by which we mean the possession of a strong, well body, free\r\nfrom pain, should bring with it great power to work and to think and to\r\nbenefit the world; and should also bring great happiness and enjoyment\r\nto the person who possesses it, for though sick people may be happy, and\r\nwell people unhappy, yet it is a general rule that to be strong and well\r\nis the first great step toward being happy.\r\n\r\nThe question, \"Is life worth living?\" was once happily answered, \"It\r\ndepends upon the liver;\" and it is true in both senses, for not only\r\ndoes happiness depend on what one gets out of life, but on good\r\ndigestion. It is only the person who feels well who really enjoys life.\r\n\r\nThe person who can get up each morning able to do a day's work or have a\r\nday's enjoyment, is the one on whom we must depend for the world's work\r\nand invention. We seldom find a strong, vigorous mind in a weak body.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the invalid is the idle member of the family or the\r\ncommunity. He can not find pleasure for himself nor do anything to help\r\nothers, and not only that, but he must be cared for by others, thus\r\ntaking the labor of the sick person himself and of his nurse. It is\r\ncoming to be seen that this is a great waste of time, of money, of\r\nwork, and of happiness, and people are determining that if these wastes\r\ncan be stopped, it is well worth all the time and thought and money\r\nnecessary to bring about the change.\r\n\r\nPeople everywhere are thinking about health, and because of this,\r\nChristian Science, the Emmanuel Movement and the various sects which\r\npractise faith or mental healing have sprung up.\r\n\r\nHospitals and health officers are doing much for the public health.\r\nDoctors themselves are changing their ideas and are teaching us not only\r\nhow to cure but how to prevent disease.\r\n\r\nDoctors are also seeking not only to prevent disease but to find new\r\nways of treating it. They are discarding drugs in as many cases as\r\npossible, frequently using serums in which cultures from the disease\r\nitself are used for its cure.\r\n\r\nHealth means more ability to work, more means of learning, of\r\naccomplishing great things, more pleasures in every day that is lived;\r\nand so it is as important to preserve health, in order to enjoy life, as\r\nit is to prevent death. We can realize how few persons have perfect\r\nhealth by noting the common salutation \"How do you do?\" or \"How are\r\nyou?\"\r\n\r\nSerious sickness is such as renders a person entirely unable to work.\r\nBenefit societies have found that the average number of days of sickness\r\nper year from each person under seventy years of age is ten, of which\r\nat least two are spent in bed.\r\n\r\nAbout a million and a half people die each year in the United States,\r\nand it is estimated that twice that number, or three million persons,\r\nare constantly unable even to care for themselves. The effect of this is\r\nfelt on the patient himself, in suffering, in loss of time in which he\r\nis unable to earn money, and in the amount spent for doctors, medicine,\r\nand nursing. It is felt on the family, in which the household machinery\r\nis thrown out while the wife and mother nurses the sick members of the\r\nfamily, or is herself too ill to work, or when the father's income stops\r\non account of sickness.\r\n\r\nThe entire community suffers from the constant idleness of three million\r\npersons, as well as from the deaths which withdraw a still larger number\r\nof persons from actual work for a period of two to five days during the\r\ntime of death and burial of the bodies of members of the family.\r\n\r\nThen there is all the long train of small ailments, which do not make us\r\nseriously ill, often do not even keep us from work, but which do take\r\naway from the pleasure and enjoyment of life, which render work a burden\r\ninstead of a delight, and lessen our ability to work by many degrees.\r\n\r\nNot only this, but they all have within them the possibility of\r\ndeveloping into serious diseases. Such lesser troubles are colds,\r\nheadache, catarrh, dyspepsia, nervousness, neuralgia, sore throat, skin\r\neruptions, rheumatism, toothache, earache, affections of the eyes,\r\nlameness, sprains, bruises, cuts, and burns.\r\n\r\nCivilization has brought us great blessings but it has also brought with\r\nit many dangers to health. Professor Irving Fisher of Yale says:\r\n\r\n\"The invention of houses has made it possible for mankind to spread all\r\nover the globe but it is responsible for tuberculosis or consumption.\r\nThe invention of cooking has widened the variety of man's diet but has\r\nled to the decay of his teeth. The invention of the alphabet and\r\nprinting has produced eye strain with all its attendant evils. The\r\ninvention of chairs has led to spinal curvature, etc., etc. Yet it would\r\nbe foolish even if it were possible to attempt to return to nature in\r\nthe sense of abolishing civilization.\r\n\r\n\"The cure for eye strain is not in disregarding the invention of\r\nreading, but in introducing the invention of glasses. The cure for\r\ntuberculosis is not in the destruction of houses but in ventilation. It\r\nis a little knowledge that is dangerous. Civilization can, with fuller\r\nknowledge, bring its own cure, and make the 'kingdom of man' far larger\r\nthan the 'nature' people can ever dream of.\"\r\n\r\nUntil within the last few years, sickness and death were regarded from\r\na religious standpoint. All sickness was to be borne with patience and\r\nresignation because all our sufferings were sent by an all-wise\r\nProvidence. But since science has clearly proved that typhoid fever is\r\nusually caused by an impure water supply, and that boiling the water\r\nwould prevent the suffering, expense and possible death; that the\r\ndreaded yellow fever can be banished from communities that destroy the\r\neggs of certain mosquitoes; and many other facts in regard to health\r\nhave been learned, a great change has come over the popular belief. It\r\nis seen that, to a great extent, man holds his own fate and is\r\nresponsible for his own suffering, and people are eager to learn more\r\nabout their own bodies, how to cure them and how to keep them well.\r\n\r\nThis knowledge has already done much to prolong life. The average length\r\nof life in India, where no attempt is made to check disease, is\r\ntwenty-five years. In England the length of life has doubled in a few\r\ngenerations. In Sweden, where the people live a sanitary life, the\r\naverage is over fifty years, in this country, forty-five years.\r\n\r\nInsurance companies and benefit societies keep close watch of their\r\nmembers and they report that a person ten years old may now count on\r\nliving to be sixty years of age. That is the average age, whereas a\r\nhundred years ago the average expectation of life at that age was only\r\nfifty-three years.\r\n\r\nAnd this is true in spite of the fact that people have been crowding\r\ninto cities, that they are living on richer foods, taking less exercise\r\nin the open air, living in houses which shut out the fresh air, and\r\ndoing dozens of other things that have tended to lower rather than to\r\nraise the average.\r\n\r\nWe can scarcely realize the possibilities of life if, with all the\r\npresent scientific knowledge of disease and health, we could have a\r\ngeneration of people living according to nature's laws.\r\n\r\nLife can be not only lengthened but strengthened. There are many\r\ninstances of frail, feeble children who have developed into\r\nexceptionally strong men and women. One of the most noted is Von\r\nHumboldt, the great scientist, who as a child was very weak physically,\r\nand, he himself says, was mentally below the average, but who lived to\r\nthe age of ninety, and developed one of the greatest minds of his\r\ncentury.\r\n\r\nDoctor Horace Fletcher, noted for his theories in regard to eating, was\r\nrejected at the age of forty-six for life insurance but so strengthened\r\nhis constitution by careful living that by the time he was fifty he not\r\nonly obtained his life insurance but celebrated his birthday by riding\r\none hundred and ninety miles on his bicycle.\r\n\r\nIf we could imagine a person who all his life had lived in a locality\r\nwhere the air was pure; in a house where fresh air entered day and\r\nnight, and which was heated to a uniform temperature; whose food had\r\nalways consisted of the most pure and nutritious material prepared in\r\nthe most wholesome way, eaten slowly and in proper quantity; if bathing,\r\nsleep, rest, exercise, brain work and pleasure had each its due\r\nproportion; if he could be always guarded from contagion and accidents,\r\nwe can imagine that such a person would be free from disease and that\r\ndeath might be long deferred. Of course, death can not be prevented,\r\nonly postponed, but disease can be prevented, and so we can increase the\r\nchances of postponing death. Doctors tell us that under ideal conditions\r\nthere would be only one cause of death--old age.\r\n\r\nThere is no question that under such conditions life could be prolonged\r\nfar beyond what is now usually considered its span. One hundred years or\r\nmore might easily, we imagine, become the average of life, instead of\r\nthe great exception.\r\n\r\nWe can hope for these things in the future though it will take several\r\ngenerations at least to bring them all about, but we need not wait so\r\nlong for some of the best results. There are many things that can be\r\ndone at once to prolong life and prevent illness. Since we know that\r\nmany diseases are preventable and we know the suffering and sorrow, as\r\nwell as expense, that come from sickness and premature death, we should\r\nall eagerly unite in doing all that we can to stop these ravages.\r\n\r\nThere are two agencies that will help to bring this about: individual or\r\nprivate means, and general or public means. Both are absolutely\r\nnecessary if we are to be successful in stamping out disease. Professor\r\nFisher says: \"Personal hygiene means the strengthening of our defenses\r\nagainst disease. Public hygiene seeks to destroy the germs before they\r\nreach our bodily defenses.\"\r\n\r\nIn the first place, in order to learn what we may do to lengthen the\r\nspan of life we must learn something of the nature of disease. Doctors\r\ntell us that diseases are of two classes. The first are hereditary, or\r\ninherited; those which pass from parents to their children and often run\r\nthrough an entire family. It is more often the _tendency_ to disease\r\nthat is inherited, rather than the disease itself, and so even these\r\ninherited diseases may often be prevented by careful living.\r\n\r\nDiseases which may be inherited include rheumatism, gout, scrofula,\r\ndiabetes, cancer and insanity. This class of diseases is the most\r\ndifficult to prevent and to cure. For some of them no cure has been\r\nfound.\r\n\r\nThe other class comprises the diseases of environment, or personal\r\nsurroundings,--that is, our manner of living both as regards our private\r\nlife and our relations to other people. These diseases are largely\r\npreventable and it is with them that most of the work of prevention is\r\nto be carried on.\r\n\r\nA disease is considered preventable if, by using the best known means of\r\ntreatment, it might be prevented or cured, so that either the disease or\r\nthe death usually resulting from it would be avoided.\r\n\r\nOf course, not all deaths from a given disease could be prevented even\r\nwith the best known means. Infant diseases constitute one class which is\r\nconsidered most hopeful of betterment through a pure milk supply and\r\nbetter hygiene; and yet many authorities believe that not more than half\r\nthe deaths could be prevented owing to the large part played by weather\r\nconditions, feeble constitutions, and other unchangeable conditions.\r\n\r\nPreventable diseases may be divided into six classes:\r\n\r\n(1) Diseases caused by lack of proper hygiene.\r\n\r\n(2) Diseases caused by bad habits.\r\n\r\n(3) Contagious diseases.\r\n\r\n(4) Diseases caused by insects.\r\n\r\n(5) Accidents, wounds, or operations and their resulting diseases.\r\n\r\n(6) Diseases remedied by slight means.\r\n\r\nWe will treat each of these in turn.\r\n\r\n(1) By proper hygiene is meant the proper treatment of the body as to\r\nbreathing, eating, drinking, sleeping, bathing and rest. This treatment\r\nincludes plenty of fresh air, both day and night, keeping outdoors as\r\nmuch as possible, and in well-aired houses the rest of the time.\r\nVigorous but not violent exercise, brisk walking, regular physical\r\nexercise, such as is practised in gymnasiums, will go far toward keeping\r\nthe body in good condition.\r\n\r\nThe question of fresh air in the home is one of the most important\r\npoints to be considered. The bedrooms, the living-rooms, and the kitchen\r\nshould have the air changed constantly, not once or twice a day. In\r\norder to prevent drafts, and that the house may not be kept at too low a\r\ntemperature in winter, a board, eight to twelve inches in height, may be\r\nplaced across the bottom of a window that is raised.\r\n\r\nMany diseases, not only of the throat and lungs, but of the other\r\norgans, may be prevented by the constant introduction of fresh air into\r\nour rooms day and night.\r\n\r\nTuberculosis causes more deaths than any other single disease in\r\nAmerica, and the sickness and disability continue longer than with most\r\ndiseases. It is extremely contagious, being a germ disease, and not an\r\ninherited one, as was formerly supposed. It increased very rapidly for\r\na few years but is now slightly decreasing, owing to better knowledge of\r\nits cause and cure.\r\n\r\nIts prevention and its cure both lie largely in fresh air. Physicians\r\nsay that no one who lives an open-air life with plenty of fresh air\r\nnight and day will contract it. The cure which is restoring hundreds to\r\nhealth is to find a place where the air is pure, and live and sleep\r\npractically outdoors; to eat as much milk, raw eggs, and meat as can be\r\ndigested and to observe the other rules of hygiene. Incipient cases,\r\nthose in the earliest stages, may sometimes be cured while continuing at\r\nwork by following the other rules as nearly as possible.\r\n\r\nOn account of the extremely contagious nature of tuberculosis, special\r\ncare should be taken to prevent its spread. The sputum coughed up from\r\nthe lungs is the principal carrier of the disease, and the person who,\r\nhaving tuberculosis, even in its earliest stages, spits in a public\r\nplace, is an enemy of mankind, for he endangers the lives of hundreds of\r\nothers. The only excuse for this is that he usually does it through\r\nignorance, but the knowledge of the danger should be so impressed on all\r\nthe people that no one could plead ignorance, and for a consumptive to\r\nspit on the street should be counted as much a crime morally as for a\r\nsmallpox patient deliberately to expose others to the disease.\r\n\r\nGreat care should of course be taken in the home of a consumptive\r\npatient to prevent the infection from spreading through the family.\r\nSeparate sleeping-rooms, thorough disinfection, and the use of paper\r\nnapkins which are burned at once, to take the place of handkerchiefs,\r\nshould be some of the means employed.\r\n\r\nPneumonia, pleurisy, bronchitis, grip, colds, and catarrh are some of\r\nthe other ailments which may be largely banished by living the outdoor\r\nlife. The method of treatment is medical, is different in each case, and\r\nshould be decided by the family physician. The constant habit of\r\nbreathing impurities, day after day and year after year, brings about a\r\ngradual change in the tissue of the lungs.\r\n\r\nIn the same way, simple food to take the place of the rich, heavy foods\r\neaten in large quantities, will prevent many of the diseases of the\r\nstomach, liver, and kidneys, and improve the general health and\r\nstrength. A diet of less meat and more eggs has been tried by football\r\nteams in training and found to give an equal amount of strength with\r\ngreater endurance. A diet of milk, cereals, vegetables, nuts, and\r\nfruits, raw or simply cooked, with a small amount of animal foods, will\r\nperhaps give the best results in this climate. Food fried in fats, rich\r\npastries and gravies are the hardest to digest, and better health will\r\nusually follow discontinuing them.\r\n\r\nThe purity of the food eaten should receive careful consideration.\r\nArtificially preserved foods are usually more or less dangerous, for\r\nalthough dealers urge that the poison contained in them is too small to\r\ndo harm we must remember that it is not the single dose that does harm,\r\nbut the many foods each containing a very small amount of poison, taken\r\nday after day.\r\n\r\nPure food laws, national and state, have done great good in driving\r\nadulterated and impure foods out of the markets by requiring all foods\r\nto be properly labeled.\r\n\r\nThorough mastication or chewing of the food is only a little less\r\nimportant than the character of the food itself. Rapid swallowing\r\nwithout chewing in childhood lays the foundation for many of the\r\ndigestive diseases of later life. If food be thoroughly masticated much\r\nthat would otherwise be hard to digest can be eaten without bad results.\r\nOne of the best known examples of this is meat, which, while full of\r\nnourishment, sets up in the large intestine a condition known as\r\n\"auto-intoxication,\" a species of digestive poison. If meat be eaten\r\nslowly and chewed thoroughly, this condition is almost entirely absent.\r\n\r\nPure drinking water is almost as necessary as pure food. We take water\r\ninto the body for three principal purposes: first, it is needed to\r\ndissolve and dilute various substances and carry them from one part of\r\nthe body to another; second, it forms a large part of the blood and\r\nother important fluids of the body, and is a part of many substances\r\nformed in the body; third, it serves to carry from the body the worn-out\r\nand useless tissues, the waste products of the body.\r\n\r\nThese are extremely poisonous and must be promptly disposed of to\r\nprevent sickness. This can not be done except by an ample supply of\r\nwater. Few persons, especially grown persons, drink enough water. Ten\r\nglasses of pure water are needed properly to supply the body.\r\n\"Insufficient water drinking is perhaps the commonest cause of the\r\ninterruption of the normal life processes,\" says Doctor Theron C.\r\nStearns.\r\n\r\nBut the common drinking cup in public places probably causes far more\r\ndisease than the drinking itself prevents.\r\n\r\nParticles of dead skin and disease-germs are left in the cup by each\r\ndrinker. Some of the most serious diseases may be carried in this way. A\r\ncup made of heavy waterproof paper, cheap enough to be thrown away\r\nafter being used once, is a recent invention that is highly recommended\r\nfor use by school children and those who are obliged to drink away from\r\nhome. The water in a public drinking-fountain should come out in a small\r\nsteady stream so that those who have no cups may drink from the stream\r\nitself as it rises. Many school-houses are so equipped.\r\n\r\nSleep is a necessary part of good hygiene. It promotes health and\r\nprevents disease. It is largely in sleep that the system renews itself,\r\nthat growth takes place, that waste products are thrown off, and the\r\nbody repairs its wastes. No less than eight hours for grown persons and\r\nten for children should be employed in sleep. Late hours and sleepless\r\nnights are the frequent cause of nervousness, eye strain, nervous\r\nprostration, and the beginning of brain troubles and insanity.\r\n\r\nBathing is also necessary to good health. The pores of the skin play a\r\nlarge part in carrying off the wastes of the body, through the\r\nperspiration, and if these become clogged, this poisonous material\r\nremains in the system. We have all noticed how a bath refreshes and\r\ngives tone to the entire body by opening the pores.\r\n\r\nThe skin is composed of minute scales, arranged in layers like fish\r\nscales. The tiny crevices between these form a lodging place for dirt\r\nand germs. If these remain, our own bodies are constantly exposed to\r\ntheir infection, if they drop off, as some are constantly doing, we may\r\nspread the contagion to others. This is strikingly illustrated by\r\nscarlet fever, smallpox, and similar diseases where these minute scales\r\nare the sole source of contagion.\r\n\r\nExercise is another necessity of health. Regular physical culture in a\r\ngymnasium will develop any muscle or part of the body almost at will,\r\nbut if this be not possible much can be accomplished in developing the\r\nbody by simple work. Gladstone found health in chopping wood, Roosevelt\r\nin a daily tennis game, and President Taft in golf. Many find it in\r\ngardening or farming. These all help to develop vigorous bodies.\r\n\r\nAnything which brings into moderate play any set of muscles, which\r\nincreases the circulation, or stimulates the secretion is beneficial.\r\nHouse-work, which, in its various forms, brings into use all the muscles\r\nof the body, is a wholesome exercise for women. Those who do no\r\nhouse-work seldom substitute for it any other active exercise, and many\r\ndiseases which are caused by deposits of waste tissues that are not\r\nthrown off by the body, are the result.\r\n\r\nRest--recreation--pleasure--these are as necessary to health as\r\nanything else, but the American people are slow to learn the need of\r\nthem. We hear much of nervous prostration as an American disease. It is\r\ndue to a variety of causes,--high living, late hours, ill-ventilated\r\nrooms, and climate; but chief of all the causes is the long hours of\r\nwork under strong pressure. Work done in a hurry and without rest may\r\naccomplish many things, but it invariably causes a corresponding loss of\r\nnerve force. Fatigue, by checking bodily resistance, gives rise to all\r\nkinds of poisons in the system. Every part of the body feels the ill\r\neffect of continued exhaustion.\r\n\r\nOf the diseases caused by bad habits, it can only be said that all the\r\nevils they cause, directly and indirectly, are entirely preventable;\r\nthat they are usually wrong morally, and that the suffering which\r\nresults is sure.\r\n\r\nUnder this head come the effects of drinking, of the use of tobacco and\r\ndrugs, and of bad personal and social habits. It is only necessary to\r\nrefrain from these bad habits to prevent all the diseases that arise\r\nfrom them, with all their train of suffering, poverty and crime.\r\n\r\nIt is not the province of this book to deal with scientific temperance,\r\nbut merely to state a few of the most serious results of the use of\r\nalcohol and other poisons. The white corpuscles of the blood have been\r\ncalled our \"standing army,\" because they are natural germ-destroyers.\r\nOne class of the white cells has the power of motion, and another class\r\nhas the power of absorbing outside matter, such as disease-germs. One\r\ndestroys the germs and the other moves them through the blood and\r\ncarries them off with the waste products of the body.\r\n\r\nThe white corpuscles thus stand as the defenders of the body, ready to\r\ndestroy the germs as they enter, and are, for each individual, the best\r\nof all preventives of germ diseases. The person whose blood is lacking\r\nin white cells is always liable to \"catch\" contagious or infectious\r\ndiseases, and the one who has that element of the blood in proper\r\nproportion is best fitted to withstand disease.\r\n\r\nLeading physicians believe that the greatest harm that comes from the\r\nuse of alcohol lies in the fact that nothing else so weakens the\r\nresistance of the white corpuscles, and that therefore the person who is\r\nan habitual user of alcohol lacks the power to repel all classes of\r\ndisease. English and American life insurance companies give us almost\r\nexactly the same figures, which show that of insured persons, the death\r\nrate is twenty-three per cent. higher among those who use alcohol than\r\namong total abstainers. It is probable that the proportion of persons\r\ncarrying life insurance is much less among the drinking classes and that\r\nif we had complete statistics the difference would be far greater than\r\nappears in the life insurance tables.\r\n\r\nOf time lost by sickness, directly and through other diseases caused by\r\nalcoholism, drugs and other bad habits, the percentage is very great,\r\naccording to all hospital records.\r\n\r\nThe number of prominent persons who have died of \"tobacco heart\"\r\nindicates that the rate of those whose heart action is weakened by the\r\nuse of tobacco is probably very large.\r\n\r\nDoctor Morrow says that if we could put an end at once to diseases\r\ncaused by bad habits it would result in closing at least one-half of our\r\ninstitutions for defective persons, and almost all of our penal\r\ninstitutions.\r\n\r\nThere is another long list of diseases which are contagious, that is,\r\nwhich one person may transmit to another. These are usually serious but\r\ntheir spread may be largely prevented by keeping the sick person alone,\r\nexcept for the necessary nurses, quarantining the house and disinfecting\r\neverything when the period of infection is past.\r\n\r\nIn this class are smallpox, diphtheria, scarlet fever, measles, mumps,\r\nchicken-pox and whooping-cough.\r\n\r\nThese latter are the so-called \"childish diseases\" which it was formerly\r\nconsidered impossible to escape, and little attempt was made to guard\r\nagainst them. Now they are recognized as serious, whooping-cough for its\r\nclose relation to brain and spinal trouble; measles for their effect on\r\nthe eyes and lungs; chicken-pox for its similarity to smallpox, and\r\nmumps for its general lowering of the tone of the system, allowing other\r\ndiseases to gain a foothold.\r\n\r\nSpecial serum treatment for diphtheria and vaccination for smallpox have\r\ngreatly reduced the danger from these once greatly dreaded diseases.\r\n\r\nOf preventable diseases none should receive more attention than typhoid\r\nfever, because it is a great scourge and yet it can be prevented by\r\nsimple means. If we understand that typhoid is a dirt disease, that it\r\ncomes only from dirt, we shall feel it a disgrace to have an epidemic of\r\ntyphoid, though one of the saddest features about it is that we must\r\nsuffer for the sins of others. The one who is attacked by typhoid fever\r\nmay not be the one who has left dirt for the disease to breed in.\r\n\r\nTyphoid fever germs are bred chiefly in manure piles, sewers, or\r\ncess-pools, and would not be transmitted to man directly, but there are\r\nseveral indirect ways in which they may be carried. Flies also breed in\r\nthe same places. Their legs become covered with typhoid germs, and then\r\nthey fly into houses directly on the food and cooking utensils. This is\r\none of the most common ways in which the disease is carried, and\r\ndoctors tell us that the common house-fly should be known as the\r\n\"typhoid fly\" so that people may know the serious danger that lurks in\r\nwhat was formerly considered as nothing worse than an annoying foe to\r\nclean housekeeping.\r\n\r\nIf houses are thoroughly screened, if cess-pools, manure piles and\r\ngarbage are kept tightly covered, screened, or, still better,\r\ndisinfected with chloride of lime, there will be no breeding-places left\r\nfor flies and this will remove one of the greatest dangers.\r\n\r\nThe other danger lies in a polluted water or milk supply. Every sewer\r\nthat is carried into a stream, every manure pile that drains into a\r\nwater course is a menace to health.\r\n\r\nVery frequently the farm well for watering stock is near the barn,--near\r\nthe manure pile, which, as it drains, carries down millions of typhoid\r\ngerms to the water-level below. The well becomes infected, the family\r\ndrink from it, and soon there may be several cases of typhoid fever in\r\nthe home.\r\n\r\nWorst of all, the milk pails are rinsed at the well, and all the milk\r\nthat is poured into them spreads the germs wherever the milk may be\r\nsold. In this way an epidemic may be carried to an entire town, and to\r\npersons who themselves have taken every precaution against the disease.\r\n\r\nDrinking water should be boiled unless one is sure of the water-supply,\r\nand surface wells are never safe unless we know that they drain only\r\nfrom clean sources, and then the water should be analyzed frequently.\r\nBoiling absolutely destroys typhoid and other germs, and well repays the\r\nextra work it makes. One case of typhoid fever causes more work than\r\nboiling the water for years, if we consider the work only.\r\n\r\nIf you can not buy pasteurized milk, and are not sure of conditions\r\nabout the dairy, your milk should be boiled, or, still better,\r\nsterilized at home by putting it in bottles or other containers, and\r\nplacing in a vessel of hot water, keeping the milk for several hours\r\nabout half-way to the boiling point, then cooling gradually.\r\n\r\nAll these means of prevention are troublesome and require time and work,\r\nbut as the result in health for the family is sure, every housekeeper\r\nshould gladly take this extra burden on herself if it be necessary. In\r\nsome states and many cities, the laws governing dairies are now so\r\nstrict that there is no need of doing this work in the home. This care\r\nin the dairies should be insisted on everywhere, even if it raises the\r\nprice of milk, because it means the saving of many doctor and drug bills\r\nand also raises the standard of public health.\r\n\r\nYellow fever was formerly dreaded more than any other single disease\r\nbecause it was so wide-spread, so fatal, and was thought to be violently\r\ncontagious, but during the Spanish-American War it was proved that it is\r\nnot contagious at all, but comes only from the bite of a certain\r\nmosquito, the stegomia, which is usually found only in hot climates. It\r\nis conveyed in this way: the mosquito bites a yellow fever patient; for\r\ntwelve days it is harmless, but after that time it may infect every\r\nperson that it bites.\r\n\r\nIf every yellow fever patient could be screened with netting to prevent\r\nhis being bitten, we could prevent the yellow fever mosquito from\r\nbecoming infected. Further, if we can prevent healthy people from being\r\nbitten by fever-infected mosquitoes, they will escape the disease, and\r\nstill further, if we can destroy the eggs of mosquitoes, we can entirely\r\nobviate all danger of yellow fever in a community.\r\n\r\nThe mosquito breeds only in water; by having all cisterns, rain-water\r\nbarrels, and other water containers carefully covered, and by spreading\r\nthe surface of pools of standing water, especially dirty water, covered\r\nwith greenish scum, with a thick coating of kerosene oil, we can prevent\r\nthe eggs from hatching. This has been done in many communities in Cuba\r\nand the southern part of the United States, and has resulted in\r\ncompletely stamping out the disease in those places.\r\n\r\nMalaria is caused by another mosquito, called the anopheles and while\r\nmalaria is seldom fatal as is yellow fever, it causes much suffering and\r\nloss of time, and strong efforts should be made to prevent it. The same\r\nmeasures that are used to prevent yellow fever will banish malaria from\r\nany community. They are the screening of patients to prevent spreading\r\nthe disease; screening all houses closely and keeping close watch for\r\nmosquitoes in the house, and covering all ponds in the neighborhood with\r\noil. New Jersey mosquitoes were formerly known far and wide, but such an\r\nactive campaign has been waged against them, that they have been almost\r\ncompletely driven from the state.\r\n\r\nThe ordinary mosquito has never been found to do any harm beyond the\r\ndiscomfort of its bite.\r\n\r\nOf other diseases caused by insects, an affection of the eyes called\r\npink-eye is carried by very tiny flies, and the dreaded bubonic plague\r\nis supposed to be transferred from sick people to well ones by the bites\r\nof fleas, which in turn are brought to this country by rats.\r\n\r\nThe hook-worm which affects so many persons in the South is often called\r\n\"the lazy disease\" since the persons afflicted with it are not totally\r\ndisabled, but are lacking in energy and vigor because the small insects\r\ntake from the blood the red corpuscles which should carry the digested\r\nfood all over the body. These insects can be destroyed by medicine, of\r\nwhich only a few cents worth is required to cure a case and make the\r\npatient fit for work and enjoyment. In Porto Rico almost 300,000 cases\r\nhave been treated by the United States government in the last six years.\r\n\r\nAnother matter which should receive careful consideration is the large\r\nnumber of preventable accidents. Mining accidents come in a few cases\r\nfrom failure to provide the best appliances in the mines, but in many\r\ncases are due to carelessness or ignorance of the operators themselves.\r\nThere still remain a large number of accidents which occur in the best\r\nregulated mines, and when no instance of special carelessness can be\r\ntraced. For years these disasters have puzzled mining engineers, but\r\nwithin the last few months it has been discovered that the minute\r\nparticles of coal dust in a dry mine completely fill the air, so that\r\nthe air itself is ready to burn.\r\n\r\nWhen a light is taken into this coal-filled atmosphere, it bursts into\r\nflame, causing a violent explosion. Sprinkling the mines, forcing a fine\r\nspray of water through the air of every part of the mines, it is\r\nthought, will prevent this class of accidents, which have furnished long\r\nlists of killed and injured each year.\r\n\r\nReports show that one miner is killed and several injured for every one\r\nhundred thousand tons of coal mined. The mining accidents of one year\r\ntotal 2,500 killed and 6,000 seriously injured.\r\n\r\nOther industries do not cause such wholesale injuries, but there are\r\nthousands of individual accidents each year where the injury varies from\r\nmangled fingers to death.\r\n\r\nWhen the cause is failure to provide suitable safeguards to machinery,\r\nor to warn employees of danger, the penalty to the employers should be\r\nmade severe, so that no consideration of money will prevent them from\r\ntaking precautions. More often, however, the injury is due to the\r\ncarelessness of the men or to the fact that they try to run machines\r\nwith which they are unfamiliar.\r\n\r\nManual training schools, night schools for working-men, with a short\r\napprenticeship in the running of machinery and an explanation of the\r\ndangers, will go far to prevent this class of accidents, but the fact\r\nwill still remain, that often those who are most familiar with machinery\r\nbecome careless and are more liable to injury than beginners.\r\n\r\nThe number of accidents that have been added to the world's list by\r\nautomobiles, both to those riding and to persons who are run over by\r\nthem, is great and is in a large measure due to carelessness in handling\r\nthe machine or to reckless driving.\r\n\r\nThe entire number of accidents in the United States, including railway\r\naccidents, reaches the immense total of sixty thousand killed and many\r\ntimes that number injured. A most appalling waste of life and labor\r\nvalue!\r\n\r\nProfessor Ditman says, \"Of 29,000,000 workers in the United States over\r\n500,000 are yearly killed or crippled as a direct result of the\r\noccupations in which they are engaged--more than were killed and wounded\r\nthroughout the whole Russo-Japanese War. More than one-half this\r\ntremendous sacrifice of life is needless.\"\r\n\r\nUntil the last quarter of a century there was a large addition to the\r\ndeath rate each year from the blood poisoning following operations and\r\ninjuries making open wounds. It was not until the discovery of the germs\r\nwhich cause septic poisoning that deaths from these causes could be\r\nchecked. The use of antiseptics, such as carbolic acid, alcohol, and\r\nvarious other preparations, the boiling of all surgical instruments, and\r\nthe boiling or baking of all articles used in the treatment of open\r\nwounds and sores has reduced the death rate at least one-half.\r\n\r\nThe rate could be lowered much more if all sores were treated as\r\nsurgical cases and carefully sterilized from the beginning. About\r\neighty-five deaths out of every hundred from these causes might be\r\nprevented.\r\n\r\nEvery Fourth of July a great many entirely preventable deaths and minor\r\naccidents occur. The toy pistol has come to be considered almost as\r\ndeadly as the larger variety. The tiny \"caps\" that are used in them are\r\nfired back into the hand of the person shooting them, tiny particles of\r\npowder enter the skin, burrowing into the flesh, and the skin closes\r\nover them, shutting out the air. If these particles carry with them\r\ntetanus germs, as is often the case, because these germs are found\r\nchiefly in the dirt of the street where most of this shooting is done,\r\nlock-jaw or tetanus, a severe form of blood-poisoning, results, and is\r\nusually fatal. The same results come less frequently from fire-crackers\r\nand other explosives, and in addition many accidents which injure hands,\r\neyes, and other parts of the body, are the result of the use of the\r\nheavier explosives.\r\n\r\nThe Pasteur Treatment is saving many lives each year by treating cases\r\nof infection from \"mad dogs\" and other animals affected with\r\nhydrophobia.\r\n\r\nAmong the diseases which can be remedied by slight means are enlarged\r\ntonsils and adenoid growths back of the nose, both of which can be\r\nremoved by a slight and almost painless operation, but which, if allowed\r\nto develop, often cause serious throat and lung troubles, deafness, and\r\nweakened minds. Slight defects of the eyes can be remedied by the\r\nwearing of glasses, but which if unchecked give rise to various nerve\r\nand spinal diseases as well as more serious eye troubles. It is believed\r\nnow that most of the blindness of later life could be prevented by\r\nproper care of the eyes in early life and by prompt attention to slight\r\ndefects of the eyes when they begin.\r\n\r\nDoctor Walter Cornell, who has made a study of eye strain says, \"Eye\r\nstrain is the chief cause of functional diseases. It is almost the sole\r\ncause of headache, is the frequent cause of digestive diseases, of\r\nspinal curvatures, and indirectly of neurasthenia and hysteria.\"\r\n\r\nDecayed teeth in children, slight in themselves, give rise to more\r\nserious troubles in later life,--ill-shaped mouths and jaws and crooked\r\nteeth result from teeth that have been drawn too early in life. Decayed\r\nteeth lead also to many stomach and digestive troubles.\r\n\r\nMedical inspection in the schools shows a surprising number of children\r\nsuffering from these minor troubles. About 80,000 children were\r\nexamined, and the records show that out of every one hundred children\r\nexamined sixty-six needed the services of a doctor, surgeon, or dentist,\r\nand some needed all three.\r\n\r\nForty out of each hundred had badly neglected teeth.\r\n\r\nThirty-eight had enlarged glands of the neck.\r\n\r\nEighteen had enlarged tonsils.\r\n\r\nTen had growths of the nose.\r\n\r\nThirty-one needed glasses.\r\n\r\nSix needed more nourishing food.\r\n\r\nThis meant that more than 52,000 of the number needed some medical care\r\nthat they would not have received at home because their parents had\r\nnever noticed the need of it. Every one of them could by prompt\r\nattention, a small dentist's bill, a slight operation of the throat or\r\nnose, or the use of glasses, (almost 25,000 needed glasses) be saved\r\ngreat suffering or inability to work in later life.\r\n\r\nAs we learn more of disease, and especially of germ diseases, we are\r\noppressed by the feeling that we are in constant danger, but we must\r\nbear in mind that it is the weak and unfit that are attacked, and that\r\nfitness, while partly inherited, is almost altogether a matter of proper\r\nhygiene. Keeping our bodily defenses in good condition against disease\r\nis as much a matter of necessity and good policy as keeping the defenses\r\nof a city in fighting condition in time of war.\r\n\r\nThat life may be prolonged and so strengthened that the average height,\r\nweight, and endurance will be increased, admits of no doubt. The same\r\nrule of cultivation runs through all nature. The original or natural\r\napple was a small, sour, bitter crab. The difference between that and\r\nthe finest products of western orchards, is altogether a matter of\r\ncultivation, selection, and proper treatment. In 1710 the average weight\r\nof dressed cattle did not exceed three hundred and seventy pounds. Now\r\nit is not far from one thousand pounds. An equal change could be made in\r\nthe human race, but because we believe so fully in personal liberty to\r\nlive our lives as we choose, little has actually been done to raise the\r\nhuman standard.\r\n\r\nThe care and hygiene of children is receiving universal attention, with\r\nthe result of a wonderful reduction in the sickness and death of\r\nchildren, but as yet comparatively few grown persons apply these lessons\r\nto their own lives, and the rates for older persons remain almost\r\nunchanged.\r\n\r\nWhen individuals have done all that they can, there still remains much\r\nthat must be done by the city, the state, and the nation. Boards of\r\nhealth can do much toward controlling epidemics by placing infected\r\nhouseholds under quarantine, by compelling householders who are ignorant\r\nor careless to clean their premises and to take other precautions for\r\nthe public health.\r\n\r\nHospitals, both public and private, have done excellent work, not only\r\nin curing disease but in gaining more definite knowledge of the nature\r\nof diseases through the study of large numbers of cases.\r\n\r\nThe cleaning of streets and the removal of garbage regularly are among\r\nthe great factors in keeping a city in a sanitary condition. New Orleans\r\nand some of the cities of Cuba and Porto Rico show strikingly what may\r\nbe done in that direction.\r\n\r\nMedical inspection of schools is a new and valuable aid to health.\r\nEpidemics of childish diseases which sweep through the schools with a\r\nfearful record of illness and a lesser one of death, may often be\r\nchecked entirely by the close watch of the medical inspector, who\r\nremoves the first patients from the schools when the disease is in its\r\nbeginning.\r\n\r\nPublic playgrounds for children in cities have an influence that it is\r\nas good for health as it is for morals, providing, as it does, fresh air\r\nand active exercise for children. Open air schools for tubercular\r\nchildren are being operated in several cities with excellent results in\r\nhealth and school work.\r\n\r\nMany states are making an organized effort to fight tuberculosis by\r\nestablishing fresh-air colonies where, with pure air, rest and plenty of\r\nthe most nourishing food, patients are restored to health.\r\n\r\nCare of epileptics and the insane by the state, with proper hygiene and\r\ntreatment, accomplishes many cures.\r\n\r\nThe nation is doing excellent work in a few lines, notably the Pure Food\r\nBureau and the Marine Hospital Corps, but perfected organization of all\r\nthe forces is lacking. The Department of Agriculture has done a\r\nwonderful work in investigating and curbing insect pests that injure\r\nfarm crops and trees, and in stamping out disease among live stock.\r\nForty-six million dollars have been spent and well spent in the work in\r\nthe last few years, but it is a matter of reproach that more pains are\r\ntaken to save the lives of cattle and farm crops than human lives.\r\n\r\nThere should be a strong central Bureau of Health with power and money\r\nscientifically to investigate disease, to distribute information as the\r\nDepartment of Agriculture does to farmers, and to carry out their ideas,\r\nas do state and city boards of health.\r\n\r\nWe have dealt with only one side of the question--the suffering and\r\nsorrow; but in a work on conservation, we must consider also the money\r\nquestion, the loss to the nation in time and money of these great wastes\r\nof health and life.\r\n\r\nThere are no trustworthy statistics as to wages. The average yearly\r\nearnings of all persons, from day laborers to presidents, is estimated\r\nat seven hundred dollars; but as not more than three-fourths of the\r\npeople are actual workers, three-fourths of this amount, or five\r\nhundred and twenty-five dollars is taken as the average wage.\r\n\r\nFrom these figures the money value of a person under five years is given\r\nat ninety-five dollars; from five to ten years, at nine hundred and\r\nfifty dollars; from ten to twenty years at $2,000; from twenty to thirty\r\nat $4,000; thirty to fifty years at $4,000; fifty to eighty at $2,900\r\nand over eighty at $700 or less. The average value of life at all ages\r\nis $2,900 and the 93,000,000 persons living in this country would be\r\nworth in earning power the vast sum of $270,000,000,000. This is\r\nprobably a low estimate but is more than double all our other wealth\r\ncombined.\r\n\r\nNow let us see how much of this vital wealth is wasted. As the average\r\ndeath rate is at least eighteen out of each thousand, we have 1,500,000\r\nas the number of deaths in the United States each year. Of these,\r\nforty-two per cent., or 630,000 are classed as preventable--so that a\r\nnumber equal to the entire population of the city of Boston die each\r\nyear whose deaths are as unnecessary as is the waste of our forests by\r\nfire.\r\n\r\nIf some great plague should carry off all the people of Boston, not the\r\npeople of the United States only, but of the whole world would be roused\r\nby the appalling calamity and every possible means would be employed to\r\nprevent other cities from sharing such a fate; but because these\r\npreventable deaths are not in one city, but are widely scattered, we\r\nhave long remained indifferent to this terrible and needless waste.\r\n\r\nThen there are always 3,000,000 persons ill, 1,000,000 of whom are of\r\nworking age. If, as before, we count only three-fourths of them as\r\nactual workers, we find a yearly direct loss from sickness of\r\n$500,000,000 in wages. The daily cost of nursing, doctor bills, and\r\nmedicine is counted at one dollar and fifty cents, which makes for the\r\n3,000,000 sick, a yearly cost for these items of more than\r\n$1,500,000,000. What should we think if nearly all of the people of the\r\ncity of New York were constantly sick, and were spending for doctors,\r\nnurses, and medicine as much money as Congress appropriates to run every\r\ndepartment of the government!\r\n\r\nIt is estimated that sickness and death cost the United States\r\n$3,000,000,000 annually, of which at least a third, probably one-half,\r\nis preventable. Is it not well worth while, then, from a money\r\nstandpoint alone, to use every effort to conserve our national health?\r\nConservation of health and life, going hand in hand with conservation of\r\nnational resources, will give us not only a better America, but better,\r\nstronger, happier, more enlightened Americans. What a new world would be\r\nopened to us if we could have a nation with no sickness or suffering!\r\nThat is the ideal, and everything that we can do toward realizing that\r\nideal is a great step in human progress.\r\n\r\n\r\nREFERENCES\r\n\r\nReport on National Vitality.

The\r\nsavage cares only for the comfort of his body, but as civilization\r\nadvances, man devotes more and more thought to those pleasures that come\r\nonly through his mind and the cultivation of his tastes.\r\n\r\nThe United States is particularly fortunate in this respect, for here is\r\neverything to inspire a love of beauty. There is the beauty of changing\r\nseasons, of our wonderful autumn forest coloring, of rivers, mountains,\r\nlakes, sea, and shore.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the beauty of our landscapes, which is everywhere to be\r\nfound, there are many special beauties which are among the world's\r\nwonder-places, and which are visited yearly by thousands of sight-seers,\r\nand each year they attract a greater number of visitors from other\r\nlands. Some of the most remarkable of these are Niagara Falls, the\r\nYosemite Valley, with its crowning glory, the Yosemite Falls, the\r\nHetch-Hetchy Falls, Mammoth Cave, the Garden of the Gods, the Grand\r\nCañon of the Colorado, the Agatized Forests of Arizona, Yellowstone\r\nPark, The Natural Bridge of Virginia, Great Salt Lake, and dozens of\r\nothers, less wonderful, but scarcely less beautiful, and equal to the\r\nmost talked-of beauties of Europe, such as the Palisades of the Hudson,\r\nLake Champlain, the Shenandoah Valley, the Dalles of Oregon, Pike's\r\nPeak, Mount Rainier, Lookout Mountain, the Adirondacks, and the entire\r\nRocky Mountain region.\r\n\r\nTo these must be added the relics of ancient civilization, the homes of\r\nthe Cliff Dwellers, the work of the Mound Builders, and such fragments\r\nas still remain of the occupation in various times and places of certain\r\nIndian tribes, and of the Norsemen and the Spaniards.\r\n\r\nAll these are to be valued for their beauty or historic interest, and\r\nare also valuable as a source of wealth to the community.\r\n\r\nThe money spent on tourist-travel in Europe is said to be more than\r\nhalf a billion dollars a year. This vast amount is spent because in\r\nEurope there is so much to delight the eye, because the cities are made\r\nbeautiful with artistic buildings filled with art treasures, because\r\nhistoric places are carefully preserved, because the villages are neat\r\nand well-kept, and the intensive farming which is practised almost\r\neverywhere leaves no waste places to grow up with weeds, and lie\r\nneglected.\r\n\r\nThere are parts of Europe, of course, where this is not true, but they\r\nare not included in the line of tourist-travel, and in general it may be\r\nsaid that Europe is visited almost solely because of its beauty:--the\r\nnatural beauty that man has preserved, the beauty that he has created,\r\nor the relics of past greatness.\r\n\r\nModern Greece would attract few visitors for its own sake. It is the\r\nruins of a mighty past,--the Acropolis at Athens and the places made\r\nfamous in mythology and literature draw thousands to its shores every\r\nyear, and add greatly to the wealth and prosperity of the country.\r\n\r\nThe same thing is true of America wherever we have preserved and made\r\nbeautiful our natural scenery. During three months in the summer, the\r\nNew York Central Railroad derives about $200,000 in fares from its\r\nNiagara business alone. Since it became a state reservation in 1885,\r\nmore than seventeen million persons have visited Niagara, and the\r\namount of money that has been spent there at hotels, for carriages,\r\nautomobiles, side-trips, souvenirs, etc., is almost beyond calculation.\r\n\r\nIn the Adirondack Park there is between $10,000,000 and $15,000,000\r\ninvested in hotels and cottages. The 15,000 clerks and helpers receive\r\nabout $1,000,000 in wages, the railroads receive another $1,000,000 in\r\nfares, and hotel guests spend between $5,000,000 and $6,000,000. All of\r\nthese advantages to the region are entirely apart from the practical\r\nuses of the forest.\r\n\r\nThese are examples which show the great amount of wealth which can come\r\nfrom preserving our natural beauties, and the same conditions exist\r\neverywhere, not only in the state and national parks, but wherever some\r\nbeautiful spot has been set aside by a city, a railroad company, or some\r\nprivate enterprise. People flock to these resorts in large numbers for\r\nrest or recreation, and to satisfy their love for the beautiful, and the\r\nresult is a gain in health and morals, more desire on the part of those\r\nwho visit them to make their own surroundings beautiful, and at the same\r\ntime a great gain in money value to the city or company that promotes\r\nsuch an enterprise.\r\n\r\nMost of the larger cities of the United States have given particular\r\nattention to the subject of public parks during recent years. They are\r\nthe breathing places for the dwellers in the city, often the only place\r\nwhere children can have fresh air and plenty of exercise, and the parks\r\nconstitute one of the greatest attractions to draw summer visitors to\r\nthe city.\r\n\r\nNearly all steam and electric railway companies own some park or\r\npleasure resort from which they derive a large income in fares, and many\r\nsteamboat companies find their largest profit from their excursion\r\nboats.\r\n\r\nAll these facts show clearly that if we consider only the gain in money,\r\nit is altogether a wise policy to include natural beauty among our\r\nnational resources, and to conserve it carefully, while if we look at it\r\nfrom the larger standpoint of preserving for future generations the same\r\nbeauties that we enjoy, the need of such conservation is still more\r\nurgent.\r\n\r\nIn our future development the United States will largely be made over.\r\nWe shall no longer have the same natural conditions that we have had in\r\nthe early years of our history, and the physical appearance of the\r\ncountry will grow better or worse each generation.\r\n\r\nIt is possible for us to make America the most beautiful land the world\r\nhas ever seen, for we have the natural beauty, and greater knowledge in\r\nsetting about the work of building than has ever been possessed by any\r\nother nation during its time of greatest growth.\r\n\r\nWe shall go far toward realizing our ideal of a beautiful America if we\r\nunderstand that the conservation of our resources means beauty, and that\r\nwaste means ugliness. Proper conservation of our mineral resources will\r\ninclude the removal of the ugly, unsightly piles of culm, slag, and\r\nother refuse that lie about the mouth of the mines, and disfigure some\r\nof our most beautiful mountain scenery, for, as we have shown elsewhere,\r\nthis should be used and not wasted. The proper use of coal would solve\r\nthe smoke problem of cities, one of the worst foes of cleanliness and\r\nbeauty, and the use of water-power would serve the same purpose. The\r\ncomplete utilization of our water resources that has been suggested\r\nwould make all our waterways contribute greatly to the beauty and\r\nattractiveness of the landscape.\r\n\r\nIn conserving our forests we not only increase our timber supply, but\r\nadd one of the greatest of all beauties, the trees which give variety\r\nand tone to every picture that our eyes rest upon. We shall have the\r\nshady roads, the long green hill-slopes, the quiet woodlands, the glory\r\nof autumn coloring, the delight of blossoming orchards.\r\n\r\nConservation of the soil, and utilization of every part of the land\r\nmean even more. Picture the contrast between a country where the\r\nhillsides are worn into gullies, where rocks are everywhere to be seen\r\ncropping above the barren soil, where the crops are scanty, the\r\nvegetation stunted; and one where every field yields a rich harvest,\r\nwhere the grain hangs heavy and golden, where every wayside nook holds a\r\nflower, where there are no neglected fence-corners, no piles of\r\nrubbish,--what we truly call \"a smiling landscape.\" Lastly, in\r\nconserving health, we do more toward promoting personal beauty and\r\nadvancing the standard of the race than in any other way.\r\n\r\nWe should not be content, however, with the beauty that comes only from\r\nthe conservation of our other resources, but should have a definite plan\r\nfor the conservation of beauty as a valuable resource in itself.\r\n\r\nThe city of Washington should be made the center of this movement toward\r\nnational beauty. There is now an organized effort on the part of those\r\nin charge of the erection of public buildings, to make Washington the\r\nmost beautiful capital in the world, and a model for other cities.\r\n\r\nThe federal government should set aside as national parks all of our\r\ngreatest natural wonders, as Yellowstone Park is now held.\r\n\r\nThe states should follow the same line and set apart in the same way\r\nthose objects of lesser interest, either natural or historic, which are\r\nto be found in every state--those that are not of sufficient importance\r\nto merit national recognition, but that will add interest to the state\r\nas a place for tourists to visit.\r\n\r\nFew states are visited in this way more than is Massachusetts, and it is\r\nlargely because not only the state, but the various communities have\r\npreserved historical places, buildings and objects so carefully, have\r\nerected monuments to commemorate them; and have thrown these various\r\nobjects of interest open to the public free of charge. These communities\r\nin turn have gained the original expenditure many times over from the\r\nmoney spent by the steady stream of visitors.\r\n\r\nThere has been a great movement toward the beautifying of cities and\r\nvillages in the past few years. Besides the good work done by park\r\nboards in cities there has been a great improvement in the matter of\r\ncleaner streets, better sidewalks, the planting of more shade trees, and\r\na far greater attention to the beautifying of private grounds. The\r\nadorning of front yards and porches with vines and flowers is increasing\r\nenormously every year.\r\n\r\nMany causes have been at work to produce this result: the broadening\r\ninfluence of travel, which brings people in touch with what is being\r\ndone in other places to promote public beauty, the work of schools,\r\nnewspaper and magazine articles, and more time and money to spend on\r\nluxuries,--even the post-card, which makes a souvenir view of every spot\r\nof local beauty or interest; but probably no other one agency has\r\nproduced such good results in public beauty as has the woman's club\r\nwhich has taken up this line of work.\r\n\r\nThe \"cleaning-up\" movement, with a public house-cleaning day twice a\r\nyear when all refuse is carted away, and streets, alleys and back-yards\r\ncleaned, had its origin in this way. The care and beautifying of\r\ncemeteries is another branch of the work.\r\n\r\nIn many places, flower and vegetable seeds are distributed free or at a\r\nnominal cost among the school children, prizes are offered for the best\r\ngarden, the largest vegetables, the most attractive back-yard, the best\r\narranged flower-bed, and other good results; the work is examined by a\r\ncommittee, and the prizes awarded at the end of the season either by the\r\nclub or by merchants who have become interested in the contest.\r\n\r\nThis provides the children wholesome outdoor work and exercise\r\nthroughout the summer, and promotes a pleasant rivalry among them,\r\nbesides increasing their knowledge of plants, and the results have been\r\nfound to be far-reaching, for not only the pupils, but their parents as\r\nwell, are interested in neater, more orderly methods of living, and in\r\nbeautifying their homes.\r\n\r\nIn the movement for public beauty, as in all other progress, it is the\r\nwork of individuals that counts most. Every house that is built with a\r\nthought for its beauty, every home, farm-building and fence kept in good\r\nrepair, every neat back-yard and flower-surrounded home has its part in\r\nmaking America more beautiful, and this influence in countless homes is\r\ncertain to count in the making of better citizens.\r\n\r\nA country where beauty meets the eye at every turn will invite the\r\ntourist and the home-seeker, will be deeply loved by its own people, and\r\nwill be an inspiration to poetry and art. It rests largely with the\r\npeople of to-day to decide whether we shall make of our own land such an\r\nideal place.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\nIN CONCLUSION\r\n\r\n\r\nNo one can read the record of facts presented in this book without being\r\nimpressed by two things: (1) How these resources depend on one another\r\nand that proper care of one results in the saving of another, and, (2)\r\nthe fact that every one of our most valued resources is decreasing so\r\nrapidly that its end is in sight, even though far in the distance. When\r\nthe end comes we know that it will mean the end of progress for our\r\ncountry in that direction.\r\n\r\nIt is also plain that the great, in fact the only, reason for this\r\nscarcity lies not in use but in waste. And lastly we see that there is\r\nyet time to prevent serious shortage in most directions if we set about\r\na general system of good management and thrift.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime we are sure to have higher prices, for the supply is\r\ngrowing less and the demand greater for almost every material. In many\r\nlines, unless something be done to check this shortage, prices will rise\r\nso high that only the rich can afford what are now considered the\r\nnecessities of life, and the lives of the poorer classes will become\r\nlike those of the peasants of Europe:--a scanty living on the plainest\r\nfood, poor homes, hard work, less opportunity to develop mind and body.\r\n\r\nLet us sum up how the various resources may be used to conserve one\r\nanother.\r\n\r\nThe soil is saved from erosion by the planting of forests, and by the\r\nstoring of the flood waters of rivers. Waste land is made fertile by\r\nproper control of the rivers through drainage, storage and irrigation.\r\nFarm crops and also the forests are increased in value by insect\r\ncontrol.\r\n\r\nThe insects are largely kept in check by encouraging the nesting and\r\nincrease of certain birds. Birds play a large part in the conservation\r\nof the crops, by destroying insects, weeds, and small mammals. The birds\r\nthemselves are sheltered and thrive only where trees are abundant.\r\n\r\nThe grazing lands are conserved by proper forest control, and the supply\r\nof animal food depends largely on the grazing lands.\r\n\r\nFisheries are dependent on proper care of the waters, which in turn\r\ndepend on forest control, and on proper care of the by-products of\r\nfactories.\r\n\r\nCoal is conserved by the use of lower-grade fuels, by using waste from\r\nthe forests, and by substituting water-power.\r\n\r\nGas and oil will also be saved by the greater use of water-power.\r\n\r\nCoal-mining is made safer to human life and much saving in coal is\r\neffected by the use of mine-timbers, which involves the planting of\r\nforests. Forests regulate to a great extent the stream-flow of rivers.\r\n\r\nBeauty can only be conserved by the planting of trees, by keeping the\r\nwaters pure and clear, by using waste products so that there will be no\r\nunsightly piles of refuse.\r\n\r\nHealth depends, among other things, on pure water, air unpolluted by\r\ncoal smoke and poisonous gases which should be used as factory\r\nby-products.\r\n\r\nAnd lastly, the life, happiness, and prosperity of man is conserved by\r\nall of these things.\r\n\r\nThe first step in this system of conservation must be education on this\r\nsubject, education not only of the children but of the men and women\r\nalso, on the need and methods of saving. There would be no danger of a\r\nscarcity of coal if manufacturers all knew the value and economy of\r\nelectric water-power or low-grade fuels, and of smoke-consuming devices.\r\nThere is no reason why insect destruction should cost the nation so\r\ndearly if the birds were protected, and a few simple methods of\r\nprevention understood. All the various water problems could be met and\r\nsolved if one general plan were adopted and carried out, and so all\r\nalong the line.\r\n\r\nWe have taken note of the great natural wastes: how two-thirds of the\r\nwood cut is wasted, and how insects and fire destroy the standing\r\ntimber; how the soil is washed down into the valleys, taking the best\r\nfrom the farms; how we are steadily robbing the soil of its most\r\nnecessary elements; how our waters are unused and we pay for this\r\nnon-use by the use of other resources that we can ill afford to spare;\r\nhow millions of acres of land which might be profitably farmed lie\r\nuseless for lack of water and other millions are useless because they\r\nare covered with water. Consumers pay high freight rates and the\r\nrailroads are so overcrowded that they are unable to care for all the\r\nbusiness, while the rivers, the cheapest of all carriers, flow idly to\r\nthe sea.\r\n\r\nWe have seen how one-fourth of the coal is left in the mines, and how\r\nsmall a part of that which is mined is actually turned into heat, how\r\ngas is allowed to escape unchecked into the air. And greatest and most\r\nserious of all, the useless waste of human life and health.\r\n\r\nBut there are scores of other wastes and extravagances that all growing\r\nboys and girls should think of, so that when they enter active life,\r\nthey may do their part to prevent them.\r\n\r\nIt is going to be necessary to learn to economize in every department of\r\nlife as all the European peoples do. We must learn, in this new\r\ncountry, to do things more with the idea of the future in mind. In all\r\nEuropean cities, there are hundreds of houses that have lasted many\r\ncenturies, but there are few houses in America that are built in an\r\nenduring way. This building up and tearing down taxes not one, but many,\r\nresources heavily. As the housewife learns that a good kettle that costs\r\na dollar and lasts five years is cheaper than a poor one which costs\r\nfifty cents but will wear out in one year, so people must learn the\r\nlesson that in building poor light houses of wood which will last a\r\ncomparatively short time, they are really paying the higher price; that\r\nin putting in poor roads, cheap bridges, badly-constructed public\r\nbuildings, that cost less heavily in the first place but that will need\r\nto be renewed in a few years, they are really paying much more than if\r\nthese had been substantially built in the beginning.\r\n\r\nThe fire loss of the United States amounts to over half a million\r\ndollars a day, and all insurance men agree that most of this might be\r\nprevented.\r\n\r\nThe remedies are to build fewer wooden houses, especially in crowded\r\ndistricts, to exercise greater care in the building and management of\r\nchimneys, greater care in electric wiring, and general watchfulness in\r\nhandling matches and lighted cigars.\r\n\r\nFor the forest fires which mean so much to all of us the remedy lies in\r\nforest patrol. The amount usually set aside for fighting fires was not\r\nallowed by some states in 1910, and the fires which cost hundreds of\r\nmillions of property and many lives were the result.\r\n\r\nMuch of the most fertile land in our country is used for raising\r\ntobacco, and grains that are made into alcoholic liquors. As these can\r\nnever be considered necessities it is well to think to what better uses\r\nthe land might be put.\r\n\r\nThe yearly bill of the United States for pleasure is gigantic, and a\r\nlarge proportion of the pleasure tends to lower rather than raise the\r\nstandard of American life and morals.\r\n\r\nThe greatest of all wastes is the waste of time and labor. The waste of\r\ntime by drunkenness, by poor work that must be done over, and by\r\nidleness, makes a large item of loss in every line of business.\r\n\r\nProper education will teach every child to work neatly and with perfect\r\naccuracy, will teach eye, hand and brain, will teach the value and\r\npleasure of work, careful management and economy and a regard for the\r\ngeneral good.\r\n\r\nA study of the great facts of our national possibilities that have been\r\ngathered together in this book should arouse in the heart of every\r\nAmerican, old and young, the feeling that here is a work for every hand\r\nand every brain, not only to save, but to use wisely; to develop all the\r\npossibilities of our great resources no less than to conserve them. In\r\nsearching for new by-products or machinery for checking the waste and\r\nadding to the usefulness of these resources there is a field for\r\ninvention that will not only bring wealth to the inventor, but\r\nprosperity and length of life to the nation.\r\n\r\nTHE END\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's Checking the Waste, by Mary Huston Gregory",
