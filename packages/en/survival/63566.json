I shall have all my hands aboard to-morrow.\"\r\n\r\nI looked up, threw away my pen, closed the gigantic ledger with a\r\nsignificant bang, and shook the hand of the speaker, who was my old\r\nfriend and schoolfellow, Bob Hartly, whose face was as red as the\r\nkeen frost of an American winter evening could make it, albeit he was\r\nbuttoned to the throat in a thick, rough Flushing coat, and wore a\r\ncap with fur ear-covers tied under his chin--a monk-like hood much\r\nworn in these northern regions during the season of snow.\r\n\r\n\"I don't think your cruise after seals and blubber will be a very\r\nlively affair, Bob,\" said I, rubbing my hands at the stove, on which\r\nhe was knocking the ashes of his long Havannah.\r\n\r\n\"Lively! if it is not more lively than this quill-driving work, may I\r\nnever see London Bridge again, or take,\r\n\r\n  'Instead of pistol or a dagger, a\r\n  Desperate leap down the falls of Niagara!'\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I am sick of this Cimmerian region!\" said I, stamping with vexation\r\nat his jocular mood, when contrasted to my own surly one.\r\n\r\n\"Cimmerian--ugh! that phrase reminds me of school-times, and how we\r\nused to blunder through Homer together, for he drew all his images of\r\nPluto and Pandemonium from the dismal country of the Cimmerii.  By\r\nJove!  I could give you a stave yet from Virgil or Ovid, hand over\r\nhand, on the same subject; but that would be paying Her Majesty's\r\ncolony a poor compliment.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, Bob, I am sick of this place, in which evil fate, or rather\r\nbad luck, has buried me alive--this frozen little town of wood and\r\ntar, without outlet by sea or land in winter, without amusement, and,\r\nat this time, seemingly without life.\"\r\n\r\n\"It forms a contrast to London, certainly,\" said Hartly, assisting\r\nhimself, uninvited, to the contents of a case-bottle of Hollands\r\nwhich stood near; \"but there is a mint of money to be made in it.\"\r\n\r\n\"The first English folks who came here were reduced to such straits,\r\nwe are told, that they killed and ate each other; and those who\r\nreturned were such skeletons that their wives and mothers did not\r\nknow them.\"\r\n\r\nHartly laughed loudly, and said--\r\n\r\n\"But that was in the time of King Henry VIII., and people don't eat\r\neach other here now.  But to resume what we were talking about----\"\r\n\r\n\"Old Uriah Skrew, my father's agent, and I are on the worst terms; he\r\nkeeps a constant watch over me.  I go from my desk to bed, and from\r\nbed to my desk--so passes my existence.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why not slip your cable and run, then?\"\r\n\r\n\"Skrew being a partner in the firm,\" I continued, warming at the idea\r\nof my own rights and fancied wrongs, \"cares for nothing but making\r\nmoney from the riches of the sea, and thinks only of cargoes of fish\r\nto be bartered in Lent, at Cadiz, for fruit and wine, oil, seals, and\r\nblubber; and really in this cold season----\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, but summer is coming,\" interrupted Bob, drily.\r\n\r\n\"Summer!  How is the year divided here?\"\r\n\r\n\"Into nine months of winter and three of bad weather.\"\r\n\r\n\"A pleasant prospect!  If I were once again at Peckham----\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, Jack, I have a grudge at old Uriah Skrew, for, like a swab, he\r\nplayed me a scurvy trick about a cargo I had consigned to your father\r\nand him, from Cadiz, last year--a trick by which I lost all my profit\r\nand tonnage.\r\n\r\n\"Likely enough; this ledger is Uriah's bible--and his God----\"\r\n\r\n\"Is gold!  So I care not a jot if, for the mere sake of provoking\r\nhim, I lend you a hand to give him the slip, for a few months at\r\nleast.  Ship with me to-morrow--as a volunteer, passenger, or\r\nwhatever you please.\"\r\n\r\n\"I shall,\" said I, throwing my pen resolutely into the fire.\r\n\r\n\"Your hand on it!  I like this.  Get your warmest toggery sent on\r\nboard; you'll need it all, I can tell you!  I can give you a long\r\ngun, and bag for powder and slugs; and then, with a bowie-knife in\r\nyour belt, a seal-skin cap with long flaps, and a stout pea-jacket,\r\nyou will make as smart a seal fisher as ever sailed through the\r\nNarrows!  By this time to-morrow you may be forty miles from your\r\nledger, running through the North Sea with a flowing sheet.  By Jove,\r\nI know a jolly old Esquimau who lives at Cape Desolation under an old\r\nwhaleboat.  He will be delighted to make your acquaintance, and give\r\nyou a feed of sea weed and blubber that will make your mouth water,\r\nthough we eat it when the mercury is frozen in the bulb.\"\r\n\r\nThis cheerful prospect of Arctic hospitality might have persuaded me\r\nto remain where I was, but soured by the treatment I experienced from\r\nMr. Skrew, who misrepresented my conduct and habits to my family at\r\nhome, and tired of the monotony of his counting-room, I looked\r\nforward with eagerness to an anticipated escape.\r\n\r\nHow little could I foresee the consequences of my impatience, folly,\r\nand wayward desire for rambling!  Ere a month was past, I had\r\nrepented in bitterness my boyish repugnance for steady application\r\nand industrious habits.\r\n\r\nMy friend, Robert Hartly, who was eight years my senior, was master\r\nand owner of the _Leda_, a smart brig of two hundred and fifty tons\r\nregister--a craft in which he had invested all his savings.  Last\r\nyear he had lost a wife and two children, whom he tenderly loved; he\r\nhad come to St. John from Cadiz, missed a freight and been frozen-in,\r\nand now, with all a sailor's restlessness and dread of being idle,\r\neven for a month or two, he had resolved to sail for the spring seal\r\nfishery, as a change of scene, and a trip which he hoped would not\r\nprove unprofitable, as his vessel was one of a class far superior to\r\nthose which usually venture into the region of ice, being well found,\r\nwell manned, coppered to the bends, and, in short, the perfection of\r\na British merchant brig.\r\n\r\n\"By the bye,\" said he, \"talking of powder and slugs, we may need\r\nboth, for other purposes than shooting seals.\"\r\n\r\n\"How?\" I asked.\r\n\r\n\"I mean if we came athwart the _Black Schooner_ which has been\r\nprowling and plundering about the coast for the last six weeks.\"\r\n\r\n\"Are there more news of her?\"\r\n\r\n\"No; but here is a placard given to all shipmasters yesterday,\" said\r\nhe, unfolding a paper surmounted by the royal arms, and running in\r\nthe name of \"His Excellency the Governor and Commander-in-Chief over\r\nthe Island of Newfoundland and its Dependencies,\" offering 500_1._ to\r\nthe crew of any ship that would capture \"the vessel known as the\r\n_Black Schooner_,\" &c.  \"She is a queer craft,\" continued Hartly,\r\n\"and said to be a slaver, bankrupt, and out of business; though Paul\r\nReeves, my mate, maintains that she is the _Adventure_ galley.  which\r\nsailed from London in the time of King William III., and that her\r\ncrew are the ghosts of Kidd and his pirates; but ghosts don't steal\r\nbeef and drink brandy.\"\r\n\r\nHartly's father had been in the navy; thus he had received a good and\r\nthorough nautical education, but early in life had been left to work\r\nhis way in the world; so he made the watery portion thereof his home\r\nand means of livelihood.  He was a handsome, hardy, and cheerful\r\nyoung fellow, and the _beau idéal_ of a thorough British seaman.\r\n\r\nOn the third finger of his left hand he wore a curious ring of base\r\nmetal, graven with runes of strange figures.  This was the gift of an\r\nold woman to whom he had rendered some service when in Iceland, and\r\nwho had promised, that while he wore it, he could _never be drowned_;\r\nconsequently Hartly was too much imbued with the superstition of his\r\nprofession to part with it for a moment.\r\n\r\n\"But how am I to elude old Skrew, and get on board,\" said I, after we\r\nhad concluded all our arrangements, over a glass of hot brandy-punch,\r\nin Bob's lodgings in Water-street.\r\n\r\n\"True--the brig lies frozen-in at the end of his wharf, the hatches\r\nare all locked, and the hands ashore.\"\r\n\r\n\"If he sees me on board, there will be an end of our project, for I\r\nhave no wish to quarrel with him in an unseemly manner; but merely to\r\n'levant' quietly, leaving a letter to announce where I am gone, and\r\nwhen I may, perhaps, return.\"\r\n\r\n\"All right--I have it!  I'll send an empty cask to Skrew's store\r\nto-morrow.  Paul Reeves, the mate, and Hammer, the carpenter, will\r\nhead you up in it, and so you may be brought on board unknown to all\r\nsave them--ay, under the very nose of old Uriah.  Will that suit you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Delightfully!\" said I, clapping my hands.  The whole affair had the\r\nappearance of an adventure, and though there were a hundred ways by\r\nwhich I might have joined the brig, when the _cutting-out_ of the\r\nsealing fleet took place next day, like a young schoolboy--for in\r\nsome respects I was little more--I accepted the strange proposal of\r\ngoing on board in a cask, and retired to bed, to dream of adventures\r\non the high seas; for being young, healthy, and active, I could\r\nalways have pleasant dreams without studying the art of procuring\r\nthem--an art on which Dr. Franklin wrote so learnedly in the last\r\ncentury.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nADVENTURE IN A CASK.\r\n\r\nOn the next day (17th of March), when the fleet of adventurers\r\ndeparts for the spring seal fishery, the little seaport town of St.\r\nJohn's presents an unusual aspect of bustle and gaiety.  On that\r\nanniversary, at least one hundred vessels, having on board three\r\nthousand seamen, batmen, and gunners, sail to seek their fortune in\r\nthe ice-fields; but on the day I am about to describe, the number of\r\ncraft and their crews far exceeded this.\r\n\r\nThe day was clear and sunny, not a speck of cloud was in the sky,\r\nwhose immensity of blue made the eye almost ache, while the intense\r\nbrilliance of the snow, which covered the hills and the whole\r\nscenery, made them seem to vibrate in the sunshine, and caused a\r\nspecies of blindness, especially on entering any apartment, however\r\nlarge or well-lighted; for after being out of doors in that season\r\nand region for an hour or so, a house usually seems totally dark for\r\na time.\r\n\r\nFor some days previous there had been that species of drizzle which\r\nis termed locally \"a silver thaw,\" thus, all the houses of the town,\r\nthe roofs, walls, and chimneys; the trees, the shipping in the frozen\r\nharbour, every mast, yard, and inch of standing or running rigging,\r\nwere thickly coated with clear ice, which sparkled like prisms in the\r\nsunshine, making them seem as if formed of transparent crystal.\r\nThen, there was a glittering in the frosty atmosphere, as if it was\r\ncomposed of minute particles, while the intensity of the cold made\r\none feel as if a coarse file were being roughly applied to one's nose\r\nor cheekbones on facing the west, the point whence the wind came over\r\nthe vast and snow-covered tracts of untrodden and unexplored country\r\nwhich stretch away for three hundred miles towards the Red Indian\r\nLake and the Bay of Exploits.\r\n\r\nThe keepers of stores and shops--who in St. John are usually dressed\r\nlike seamen, in round jackets and glazed hats--with all idlers, were\r\npouring through every avenue and thoroughfare, and spreading over the\r\nharbour.  All the ships displayed their colours, and the sound of\r\nmusic, as bands perambulated the ice, rang upon the clear and ambient\r\nair, mingled with the musical jingle of the sleigh bells, as the more\r\nwealthy folks, muffled and shawled to the nose, galloped their horses\r\nwith arrow-like speed from side to side of the harbour.\r\n\r\nThe latter and the town (but especially the grog-shops) were crowded\r\nby the seal fishermen, who had come in from all parts of the coast,\r\nand bore bundles of clothing slung over their backs, each having his\r\ncarefully selected club wherewith to smite the young seals on the\r\nhead, and also to be used as a gaff or ice-hook.  Many of these men\r\nwere also armed with long sealing-guns, which are twice the size and\r\nweight of an ordinary musket, and resemble the huge, unwieldy gingals\r\nof the East Indians, having flintlocks of a clumsy fashion.\r\n\r\nThey are generally loaded with coarse-grained powder and pieces of\r\nlead, termed _slugs_, to shoot the old seals, who frequently prove\r\nrefractory, and dangerous when defending their young.\r\n\r\nThose fishers who are thus armed as gunners rank before the mere\r\nclubmen, and receive a small remuneration, or are remitted some of\r\nthe \"berth money\" which is usually paid to the storekeeper or\r\nmerchant who equips the vessel for the ice; \"the outfitting,\" says\r\none who is well-informed on these matters, \"being always defrayed by\r\nthe receipt of one-half the cargo of seals, the other half going to\r\nadventurers, with these and other deductions for extra supplies.\"\r\nBut, as Captain Hartly fitted out his own vessel and shipped his own\r\ncrew, gunners, and batmen at stipulated salaries, he expected to reap\r\nthe whole profits of the expedition.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the project I had in view, I was particularly anxious\r\nto witness the gaiety of this the only and yearly colonial gala\r\nday--the shipping of the crews, (who always proceed in procession\r\nalong the ice,) with the cutting-out and departure of the sealers;\r\nbut old Mr. Uriah Skrew, with his clean-shaven face and small cunning\r\neyes, was in the counting-room betimes, and piled work upon me thick\r\nand fast, to anticipate any application for a day's leave.\r\n\r\n\"May I not go out for an hour, sir, and see what is going on in the\r\nharbour?\" I asked, gently.\r\n\r\n\"No, sir,\" he replied, sharply; \"such nonsense only leads to\r\nidleness--idleness to dissipation, and dissipation to ruin!  That is\r\nthe sliding-scale, young man----\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh! my good sir, you are too severe.\"\r\n\r\n\"Severe!  Mr. Jack Manly!----\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, sir?\"\r\n\r\n\"I have always been kind and indulgent to you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Kind--hum.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes; more kind and indulgent than your father, my worthy partner,\r\nwishes--and more than he would be.\"\r\n\r\n\"Query?\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you mean by 'query'?\" he demanded in a bullying tone, for he\r\nintensely disliked me, fearing that I should soon be admitted into\r\nthe firm.\r\n\r\n\"Because I have my doubts on the subject, and your refusal to grant\r\nme leave to-day confirms my opinion of you, Mr. Skrew.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well; enough of this, not a word more, or by the first ship for\r\nEurope I will write what you'll wish had not been written.  Not a\r\nword more.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am mute as a fish.\"\r\n\r\n\"Engross these papers--but, first, go to the store on the wharf, and\r\ntell the keeper to speak with me; and look sharp!\"\r\n\r\nI put on my cap and left the counting-room, feeling assured that many\r\na day would elapse ere I stood within it again, as I caught a glimpse\r\nof Paul Reeves, mate of the _Leda_, and two seamen, loitering\r\noutside; but near the window, wherein stood my desk, under the leaf\r\nof which I deposited a letter addressed to Mr. Skrew, informing him,\r\nin the parlance of Bob Hartly, that \"I had slipped my cable and gone\r\nto sea.\"\r\n\r\n\"Captain Hartly's friend, sir?\" said the mate, touching his hat, and\r\nwinking knowingly.\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"All right, sir! here is the cask, step in, and Tom Hammer, our\r\ncarpenter, and his mate, will head you up in it comfortably in less\r\nthan a minute.\"\r\n\r\n\"No one is near?\" said I, anxiously glancing round the courtyard.\r\n\r\n\"Not a soul, sir: in you go, on with the head, Tom, and be quick, for\r\nthe ice channel is cutting fast to the fairway; the jib and\r\nforetopsail are loose, and the lashings all but cast off.\"\r\n\r\nThe counting-room of Messrs. Manly and Skrew stood within a\r\ncourtyard, which was entered by a gateway from Water-street; and from\r\nthis court--which was formed by four large wooden stores, all\r\npitched, tarred, and now coated with snow and ice--a path led down to\r\nthe wharf, at the end of which, as at the end of all the others that\r\njutted into the harbour, a mercantile flag was displayed from a mast.\r\nIn this court were piles of old barrels, hampers, boxes, an anchor, a\r\nspare topmast or so, half buried under the usual white mantle, on\r\nwhich a flock of poor little snowbirds were hopping and twittering\r\ndrearily.\r\n\r\n\"Do you feel snug, sir?\" inquired Paul Reeves, through the bunghole.\r\n\r\n\"Yes; but please to lose no time in getting me through the crowd on\r\nthe wharf, and on board the _Leda_\" I replied, in a somewhat\r\nimploring tone of voice; for the cask, though a roomy one, was the\r\nreverse of comfortable, and already I longed to stretch myself.\r\n\r\n\"The _Leda_ lies just outside the Bristol clipper.\"\r\n\r\n\"She that was overhauled and plundered, and had three of her crew\r\nshot by the _Black Schooner_?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir,\" replied Reeves, as the two seamen hoisted up the cask;\r\nand I soon became aware by the clamour around me that I was being\r\nconveyed down to the wharf, where Mr. Skrew, in a full suit of\r\nPetersham and sables, was walking to and fro till his sledge arrived.\r\n\r\n\"Hallo, what have you fellows got in the cask?\" he demanded as I was\r\nborne past him.\r\n\r\n\"Some of the captain's stores, sir,\" replied Reeves.\r\n\r\n\"His grandmother's best featherbed,\" added the carpenter.\r\n\r\n\"Very good,\" said Uriah, as I was deposited almost on his gouty toes.\r\n\r\nMen often stumbled against my cask, and swore at it or pushed it\r\naside.  Once a fellow seated himself on it, and kicked with his heels\r\ntill I was nearly deranged, and the impulse to scare him by a shout\r\nbecame almost irrepressible.  For a time, I dreaded that it might be\r\ntumbled off the wharf into the sludge and broken ice alongside!\r\n\r\nEre long the wharf was cleared; I heard the clanking of the gates, as\r\nthe keeper, by order of Mr. Skrew, locked them, doubtless to exclude\r\nme therefrom on this great gala day; and then followed the jangling\r\nof bells, as he stepped into his sledge, and departed upon the ice.\r\nThus I was left to my own reflections on the solitary wharf.\r\n\r\nBefore this, a great commotion had taken place at the extremity\r\nthereof, as the Bristol clipper by some mismanagement ran foul of the\r\n_Leda_, and the usual volleys of threats, oaths, and orders incident\r\nto such collisions in harbour were exchanged from the decks and\r\nrigging of both vessels, while, by using boat-hooks aloft and fenders\r\nbelow, the crew strove to keep the rigging clear and the hulls apart.\r\n\r\nAmid this unexpected hurly-burly, I was _forgotten_ in my cask!\r\n\r\nThe wharf stood near the western extremity of the town, which lies\r\nalong the basin of the harbour.  The sounds in my vicinity seemed all\r\nto die away, as the crowd along the shore and upon the ice followed\r\nthe ships, which in succession were warped along their ice-channels\r\ninto the fairway, and each was greeted by a tremendous cheer as the\r\nsails fell, their head canvas filled, and they broke into blue water;\r\nbut hours seemed to elapse, without a person coming near the horrible\r\ncask in which I was imprisoned, and the agonies I endured are beyond\r\ndescription!\r\n\r\nThe sense of oppression and of being cramped amounted to intense\r\nbodily torture; thus a perspiration alternately burning hot and icy\r\ncold burst over me.  The interior of this now detested prison seemed\r\nhot as a furnace; yet there was in my soul a deadly fear of perishing\r\nby cold, as I should assuredly do, if left all night on the locked\r\nwharf, in such a climate, with the thermometer at twelve degrees\r\nbelow the freezing point!\r\n\r\nHow fruitlessly I repented me of the silly project of thus escaping,\r\nand alternately longed to be back again in Skrew's snug\r\ncounting-room, or on board the departing brig--of being anywhere,\r\ninstead of being thus \"cabin'd, cribb'd, confin'd,\" and forgotten.  A\r\nterror of being conveyed on board, and left, perhaps, in the\r\nhold--left undiscovered till dead of suffocation, gave me wild\r\nenergy; madly I strove to kick or beat out the head of the cask; but\r\nmy legs were powerless, as if suffering from paralysis, for my aching\r\nknees were wedged under my chin, and I might as well have attempted\r\nto escape from a block of adamant.\r\n\r\nFaintness and delirium were fast coming over me!  I screamed like a\r\nmadman; but my hoarse voice was lost in the hollow of the cask.\r\nThough a perspiration bathed all my aching limbs, my tongue clove to\r\nmy palate, and soon became hot and dry.  Starry lights seemed to\r\nflash and dance before me in the darkness; my brain reeled; then I\r\ngasped, as sense and pulsation ebbed together, and after enduring\r\nthree hours (as I afterwards learned) of such agony as those who were\r\nconfined in the stone chests of the Venetians, or in the iron cages\r\nwhich Louis XI. placed in the Bastille, alone could have known--I\r\nfainted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nTHE NARROWS OF ST. JOHN.\r\n\r\nOn recovering, I found myself in the cabin of the _Leda_, with\r\nCaptain Hartly hanging over me, and chafing my hands and temples, in\r\nanxiety and solicitude, with hartshorn and vinegar; for being a\r\nkind-hearted fellow, he was seriously alarmed.\r\n\r\nIn these friendly offices he was ably assisted by Cuffy Snowball, his\r\nblack cook, who burned several grey goose-quills under my nose, and\r\nwho brought me a rummer full of brandy-punch steaming hot from the\r\ngalley.  On swallowing this, which they forced me to do at two\r\ndraughts, I became considerably revived and invigorated.\r\n\r\n\"Why did you leave me there, Hartly--it might have been, to die?\" I\r\nasked, reproachfully.\r\n\r\n\"I did not leave you, my dear boy, at least not a moment longer than\r\nwe could help,\" he replied.  \"It cost us no small trouble to get\r\nclear of that lubberly barque.  I wish the _Black Schooner_ had sunk\r\nher, when athwart her hawse!  We had to clap on all hands to warping\r\ninto the fairway, and once there, we had to keep constantly forging\r\na-head, as other craft were crowding into the channel astern of us.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then I was pretty near being left till the wharf-keeper came next\r\nmorning.  My heaven!  I should have been stiff enough by that time!\"\r\n\r\n\"I sent Paul Reeves and Hans Peterkin to bring off the cask on a\r\nsledge, and you may imagine the fright we were in on finding you\r\ncramped up and lifeless as a pickled herring!\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Hartly,\" said I, \"the torture I endured was frightful!  I now\r\nrepent of my undertaking, and wish myself back again.\"\r\n\r\n\"Repent--bah!  It has been a stupidly managed job, but it is over\r\nnow, and there is an end of it.  Take another sip of the hot\r\nbrandy-and-water, and come on deck; we are abreast of the Crow's Nest\r\nnow, and in ten minutes more will be in blue water; then hurrah for\r\nthe ice-fields!\"\r\n\r\nI followed him on deck, and found that we were, as he said, abreast\r\nof a high sugar-loaf shaped rock, crowned by a little battery named\r\nthe Crow's Nest, and that around us a very exciting scene was passing.\r\n\r\nThe _Leda_ was now in the fairway, or main channel, which was formed\r\nthrough the ice in the centre of the harbour, and into which there\r\nwere cut more than fifty canals, or connecting links, along which the\r\nsealing ships were being warped from the various wharves at which\r\nthey had been fitted out.  All were gaily decked with their owners'\r\nprivate colours, and had their courses, or lower sails, cast loose,\r\nand were accompanied by crowds, who were conversing, laughing, and\r\nexpressing their hopes of a successful fishery to the crews, whose\r\nvoices rang cheerily as they tripped round the capstan or wrenched at\r\nthe windlass, till they came abreast of the kedge anchor which was\r\nwedged in the ice; and then it was torn up, and carried off a-head\r\ntowards the Narrows.  when the cheering, warping, and tripping began\r\nanew.\r\n\r\nThousands of persons, many of them on skates, covered all the glassy\r\nexpanse of the frozen harbour, which from some points of view appears\r\nland-locked, so closely do the mountains of rock converge at its\r\nentrance; and hundreds of sledges (Mr. Uriah Skrew's among the\r\nnumber), with round Russian bells at their horses' collars, or on the\r\ncircular iron rod above their ears, with the drivers muffled in furs,\r\nswept to and fro; while bands of music playing the air invariable on\r\nthis occasion, \"St. Patrick's Day,\" marched alongside of the\r\ndeparting fleet.\r\n\r\nFlags of every fashion--square, triangular, and swallow-tailed--were\r\nstreaming everywhere; on the mastheads of the shipping, on the\r\nblack-tarred mercantile stores, and on the dwellings of their\r\nowners--a passion for a display of bunting being one of the\r\npeculiarities of this our most northern colony in America.\r\n\r\nThe aspect of its capital, which covers the northern slope of the\r\nharbour, is rather pretty, though the country beyond is nearly as\r\nwild and as dreary as when, in the words of Hakluyt--\"in the yeere of\r\nour Lord 1497, John Cabot a Venetian, and his son Sebastian, with an\r\nEnglish fleet from Bristol, discovered that land which no man had\r\nbefore attempted, on 24th June, about five of the clocke, early in\r\nthe morning.  That island which lieth out before the land, he called\r\nof _St. John_, as I think, because it was discovered upon the day of\r\nJohn the Baptist.\"\r\n\r\nDuring the brief summer, this harbour, the entrance of which is so\r\nnarrow that two ships can scarcely pass in the dangerously deep\r\nmid-channel, is smooth as a mill-pond, and presents a lively scene,\r\nfor there the smart Clyde-built clipper, the dark and battered\r\nSunderland collier brig, the smart Yankee liner, with her gaudy stars\r\nand stripes, her snowy decks, and gear so taut; the Pomeranian, with\r\nher grass-green hull and fur-capped crew; the Dutch galliot, all\r\nbrown varnish, and shaped like a half cheese, or like the old craft\r\nthat bore the Crusaders to Palestine; the huge ship of Blackwall,\r\nredolent of guano, all blistered, rusted, and turned yellow by the\r\nsun of the fiery south; the sharp Spanish brig, which had run her\r\ncargo of slaves in South Carolina and escaped here, to go quietly\r\nhome, with her brass nines hidden in the hold, and with fish in Lent\r\nfor the pious at Cadiz or Oporto--during the brief season of summer,\r\nI say, all these had been here; but now when a snowy mantle covered\r\nthe land, and black ice locked the harbour, its basin or bosom\r\npresented a very different scene.\r\n\r\nFloundering through sludge and water, a thousand of those men who are\r\nEngland's real pioneers in the Far West--Irish emigrants--in long\r\nboots, were cutting the thick ice with ponderous saws, and pushing\r\nthe blocks under the solid mass on either side, to form a fairway or\r\nclear channel for the shipping; and this channel, though at least\r\ntwenty feet broad, would certainly be frozen hard and fast ere\r\nmorning dawned.\r\n\r\nOn this occasion there passed out with us, as I have elsewhere\r\nstated, more than one hundred sail of sealing craft.  There were\r\nbrigs, brigantines, and schooners, ranging from fifty to two hundred\r\nand fifty tons, all following each other through the fairway, warping\r\nahead, till beyond the Chain Rock, where they got into open water.\r\n\r\nMany of the smaller craft are miserably adapted for the dangers they\r\nhave to encounter, and thus are frequently crushed or lost in the ice\r\nby being swept off among the floes and fields to the far north, from\r\nwhence they never return.  Some, I have observed, had only a box\r\nlined with fire-brick placed on edge, lashed aft the foremast, for a\r\ncaboose, and an iron cauldron on three legs placed therein for\r\nboiling the wretched mess of old salt pork and doughballs which form\r\nthe daily food of the crew, who, with such apparatus, would be unable\r\nto cook anything in foul weather or a heavy sea.\r\n\r\nThe wind was southerly for a time, but gradually veered a little to\r\nthe west as we neared the harbour mouth.  After passing the Chain\r\nRock, where a cable of Cyclopean aspect, that now lies a mass of rust\r\nthereon, was wont in times of war and alarm to be stretched across to\r\nthe Pancake Rock to secure the harbour at night, we found ourselves\r\nin the deep water.  With a loud cheer we brought the kedge anchor and\r\nhawser on board.  Paul Reeves took the wheel; we sheeted home the\r\nforesail and gib, let fall the fore and main topsails, and brought\r\nthe starboard tacks on board when we were clear of the Signal Hill,\r\nand the Dead Man's Bay--a dreary inlet of the sea--lay on our quarter.\r\n\r\nThis hill is a stern and precipitous mountain of sandstone and\r\nslate-rock, nearly six hundred feet in height, with batteries that\r\nrise over each other in tiers, to the highest, which is named \"The\r\nQueen's.\"  Opposite, towers an equally abrupt mountain of similar\r\nheight and aspect, having at its base a little promontory defended by\r\nFort Amherst.\r\n\r\nThe slender gut between is named the Narrows of St. John.\r\n\r\nThe breeze came more and more round upon our quarter as we ran past\r\nSignal Hill, ploughing through a somewhat heavy surf; past the Sugar\r\nLoaf, and a little creek where, in the clear summer sea, I have seen\r\nthe guns of an ancient and forgotten wreck lying like black dots on\r\nthe smooth white sand many fathoms below; for in these regions, when\r\na brilliant sun shines upon the ocean, its waters become transparent\r\nto a wondrous depth; thus giant corals, dusky weeds, and the\r\nsnow-white bones of mighty fish,\r\n\r\n  \"With the rainbow hues of the sea-trees' bloom,\"\r\n\r\nmay be seen distinctly at the depth of a hundred and fifty feet from\r\nthe surface.\r\n\r\nThere, too, I have seen the bright yellow sea anemone, with its long\r\nfibrous leaves, that close and shrink into the rocks from view when\r\ntouched.\r\n\r\nCape St. Francis, one of the eastern promontories of Avalon, was soon\r\nupon our beam; Cape Spear light had sunk into the waves astern, and\r\nnight was coming down upon the wintry sea, when we hauled up a point\r\nor two to the north and west, and stood right away to the icy regions\r\nof the North; and that night merrily at supper we sang in the cabin--\r\n\r\n  \"'Twas in the year of 'sixty-one,\r\n  Of March the seventeenth day,\r\n  That our gallant ship her anchor weighed\r\n  And to the North seas bore away,\r\n                                  Brave boys,\" &c.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nTHE BRIG \"LEDA.\"\r\n\r\nWe had twenty-four hands on board; twelve of these were landsmen,\r\nbeing gunners and batmen, half agriculturists and half fishermen,\r\nwho, at times, in summer, left their families to till the scanty\r\nsoil, while they fished in open boats among the countless creeks and\r\nbays which indent the peninsula of Avalon; and now in winter, when\r\nall out-of-door operations were suspended, and the land was buried\r\nunder fourteen feet of frozen snow--and when the sea, even to the\r\ndistance of two hundred miles, would soon be bound with ice, they\r\nbecame seal-fishers; and, like others, had shipped in the little\r\nfleet which, on St. Patrick's Day, always departed from this\r\nIro-American isle for the stormy seas that lash the Labrador.\r\n\r\nAll these men were Irish and oft at sea; I have heard the poor\r\nfellows, when seated under the leech of the foresail, with the icy\r\nspray flying over them to leeward, singing the sweet or merry songs\r\nthey had learned at their mothers' knee, in the brave old land they\r\nwere fated never to see again--for the story of our crew is a sad one!\r\n\r\nWe had a negro, who was our cook (of course), Cuffy Snowball--I never\r\nheard him named otherwise; and his adventures had been somewhat\r\nsingular.\r\n\r\nCuffy had been a warrior of Congo, and dwelt in a hut on the banks of\r\nthe Zaire, where, by dint of \"his spear and shaggy shield,\" he had\r\namassed a wealth of baskets, gourds, carved calibashes, and wooden\r\nspoons from cowards who could not defend them.  He could tell, with\r\ngreat simplicity, innumerable stories of his combats with other\r\ntribes, and with lions, leopards, buffaloes, crocodiles, and\r\nhippopotami; and in evidence of his prowess, he wore on his left arm\r\na bracelet formed entirely of lions' teeth--which form a kind of\r\n\"Order of Valour\" in Congo.  He had been very happy in his wigwam,\r\ntill the daughter of a Chenoo or chief--a beautiful damsel, with her\r\nteeth painted blue and the bone of a shark through her nose--espied\r\nhim one day, and desired to have him for her husband, as it is the\r\nright of these ladies to do.\r\n\r\nThe chosen, of whom she becomes absolute mistress and proprietress,\r\ndare not refuse, so poor Cuffy was married to the Chenoo; there were\r\ngreat rejoicings, and three prisoners of war were devoured at the\r\nmarriage-feast.\r\n\r\nBut his sable fair one tired of him in a short time, and by certain\r\nartful means decoyed him one evening to the mouth of the Zaire, and\r\nthere sold him into slavery.\r\n\r\nThe slave-ship was wrecked; but Cuffy got ashore on the island of\r\nJamaica, where he was very much surprised to see some of his\r\ncountrymen, dressed and armed like white men, in coats of a red\r\ncolour, with light blue trousers; so he enlisted as a soldier in one\r\nof her Majesty's West India Regiments.\r\n\r\nEre long Cuffy was made a corporal; and though he ground his sharp\r\nteeth now and then when thinking of his wigwam in Congo, and the\r\ntreacherous Chenoo his wife, he was very happy, for he had plenty of\r\nrice, yams, and sangaree, and as a corporal, carried his black snub\r\nnose very high indeed!\r\n\r\nFrom Jamaica his company was ordered to Trinidad, and the whole, a\r\nhundred in number, were shipped on board of a Yankee barque which had\r\nbeen freighted for the purpose.  Her skipper, on seeing such a choice\r\nlot of tall and handsome young negroes, proposed to their captain (a\r\nreckless fellow, who was steeped to the lips in debt and all kinds of\r\nWest Indian dissipation) to bear away for the Southern States of the\r\nUnion, and there sell the whole as slaves.  Singular as it may seem,\r\nthe captain, who owed more money in Trinidad than he could ever hope\r\nto pay, accepted the proposal, and the soldiers of this company of\r\nH.M. West India Regiment, instead of garrisoning the isle where the\r\n\"mother of the cocoa\" blooms, were duly landed at Charleston in South\r\nCarolina, where they were all sold to the highest bidders.  The\r\nskipper and captain put the money in their pockets, leaving the\r\nastonished lieutenant and ensign to get back to headquarters in\r\nJamaica as they best could.\r\n\r\nCuffy's new master proved a severe one, and under his lash he often\r\nsighed for the rice, yams, and his quiet duty as sentinel under a\r\nsunshade, or the high authority he could wield as corporal over\r\nScipio, Sambo, or Julius Cæsar, in the days when he was the white\r\nman's comrade; but one day Cuffy lost his temper, and gave his master\r\na tap on the head with a sugar-hoe!\r\n\r\nThen, without waiting to see whether or not he had killed him, he\r\nfled into the woods--crossed the Savannah river, and getting on board\r\na British vessel became a sailor, and within one year thereafter, was\r\nshipped, as cook, on board the _Leda_.\r\n\r\nThe rest of our crew were all steady and hardy men, and Paul Reeves,\r\nthe senior mate, was the model of an English sailor.\r\n\r\nThe wind had changed during the night; thus, when next day dawned, we\r\nwere still in sight of Cape St. Francis--a snow-covered headland,\r\nwhich shone white and drearily, as the sun came up from the blue sea.\r\n\r\nHartly expressed some impatience at our progress as we trod to and\r\nfro aft the mainmast in the clear, cold, bracing air of the morning,\r\nwhile the odour of a hot breakfast, which Cuffy was preparing, came\r\nin whiffs from the galley.\r\n\r\n\"Never mind,\" said I; \"the wind will soon change again--I can see by\r\nthe clouds there are contrary currents overhead; and when once among\r\nthe ice, we shall have great fun!\"\r\n\r\n\"Fun!  I don't know much about that,\" said Hartly, who, like every\r\nseaman, was put in a sulky mood by a foul wind.\r\n\r\n\"We shall have perils to encounter!\"\r\n\r\n\"Perils may be fun to one so young as you, Jack,\" said Hartly,\r\npausing thoughtfully; \"however, in our trade, I have ever found that\r\nperil and profit go together.  Think over all we have read of what\r\nParry, Ross, Scoresby, Franklin, and Kane underwent in those regions\r\nof ice and snow; and I do not remember the word _fun_ occurring once\r\nin their narratives.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said I, abashed by his monitory tone, \"we shall have\r\nexcitement, at all events.\"\r\n\r\n\"Both excitement and danger, I grant you,\" said he, as we resumed the\r\nusual quarter-deck step and trod to and fro again: \"it is a\r\nwell-paying speculation, a sealing expedition; and, by Jove! it would\r\nneed to be so to compensate poor fellows for all they undergo in such\r\na rigorous season, and in such seas as those which sweep round the\r\nfrozen rocks and shores of Newfoundland and the drearier Labrador in\r\nthe blustering month of March.  Some crews are frozen in, far at sea,\r\nfor months and months, till all perish of starvation; others are lost\r\nin detached parties on the ice-fields, in fogs, and are never found\r\nagain.  Some are swept out to sea on broken floes, or fall through\r\nholes in the ice, and are never more seen.  Then the strongest ships\r\nare often crushed, as you would crush an egg upon an anvil, by the\r\nice-fields, masses of which, perhaps a hundred miles in extent, are\r\nwhirled, dashed, and split against each other by opposite currents,\r\nwith a sound so frightful, that one might well imagine the last day\r\nwas at hand, or that chaos had come again!  Ah, we should have some\r\nprofit, after encountering all that!\"\r\n\r\n\"I should think so,\" said I while glancing at my watch, and\r\nreflecting that Mr. Uriah Skrew would, about this time, find the\r\nfarewell letter I had left for him on my desk in the counting-room.\r\n\r\n\"But I do not say all this, Jack Manly, to cast you down,\" said\r\nHartly, laughing; \"for you will always be safe with me, as you know I\r\nnever can be drowned, while wearing _this_ ring.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you really believe in it?\" I inquired.\r\n\r\n\"Why, I don't know, Jack; but I should not like to lose it now: we\r\nsailors have strange fancies at times, but, with all our alleged\r\nsuperstition, are, I cannot help thinking, more religious than you\r\nlandsmen.  One who finds his daily bread upon the waters, and is for\r\never struggling with the wild elements by night and day, must at\r\ntimes think solemnly of the mighty Hand and Will that fashioned them\r\nout of thin air.\"\r\n\r\n\"But your ring?\"\r\n\r\n\"She who gave it me was a strange old woman, whom we called Mother\r\nJensdochter--a kind of Norna of the Fitful Head, who lived, or for\r\naught I know, lives still, in a hut at the base of Mount Hecla, in\r\nIceland.  I was wrecked there, when on a voyage in the _Princess_, of\r\nHull, bound for Archangel, five years ago.  This witch occupied a\r\nregular Icelandic hut.  It was built of wreck and drift wood, caulked\r\nwith moss and earth, roofed with rafters of whale-ribs covered with\r\nturf, and having in the centre a hole for a chimney.  Her bed was a\r\nmere box of seaweed, feathers, and down; but I seldom saw any house\r\nof a better kind in Iceland.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well?\"\r\n\r\n\"She used to sell fair winds or foul, blessings or maledictions, as\r\nthe matter might be, to the fishermen of the fiords.  She would give,\r\nas the simple folks believed, a fair wind that would carry a craft as\r\nfar as Cape Horn without lifting tack or sheet; or a curse that would\r\nsink the _Royal Albert_ line-o'-battle ship, for a loaf of ground\r\ncodfish, or a bottle of hockettle oil for the iron cruse that hung\r\nfrom her whalebone rafters; but she conceived a strong regard for me,\r\nbecause I had saved her miserable life in a snowstorm one night, and\r\ncarried her in my arms--ugh! what a precious armful she was!--to her\r\nwigwam.  She used to assure me that whenever there was a battle being\r\nfought anywhere in the world, the terrible mountain that overhung her\r\ndwelling vomited black ashes and stones; and then, as she sat at her\r\ndoor, with her long grey locks hanging over her fierce red eyes, she\r\ncould see troops of infernal spirits carrying the souls of the\r\ndamned, shrieking through the air, towards the flaming crater.  The\r\nnoise of the ice-floes dashed against the shore, she alleged to be\r\nthe groans of others, who were doomed to endure excess of cold for\r\neternity, even as those in Hecla were to endure excess of heat; and\r\nshe had many other fancies wild enough to make a poor Jack Tar's hair\r\nstand up on end!\r\n\r\n\"Near her hut stood a conical knoll, covered with fine green grass,\r\nand thence named the Groenbierg.  There, she asserted, by putting an\r\near to the ground, she could hear the large-headed gnomes and little\r\nbandy-legged dwarfs, who dwelt in it, busy at work, fashioning\r\ntrinkets and curiously carved goblets--especially at Yule, where the\r\nclink of their tiny hammers rang like chime-bells on little anvils;\r\nand the puff of their bellows and forge could be heard, with the\r\njingle of gold and silver coins, and opening and shutting of\r\nquaintly-carved and iron-bound treasure-chests, which they were\r\nshoving to and fro, and hiding in the bowels of the mountain.  She\r\nfell asleep there one evening, and dreamed that the Grcenbierg\r\nopened, and there came forth a little man in a red cloak and pair of\r\npuffy breeches, with a white beard the entire length of his body\r\n(that is, about two feet,) and he bestowed this ring upon her, with a\r\npromise that whoever wore it was free from all danger hereafter.  He\r\nthen vanished into a mole-track on the hill-side.  Mother Jensdochter\r\nawoke, and found the ring upon her finger, where it remained, until,\r\nin a burst of gratitude, she bestowed it on me, with the comfortable\r\nassurance (I give you the yarn, Jack, for what it is worth) that I\r\n'could never be drowned while it remained on my finger.'  Hans\r\nPeterkin--forward there!\"\r\n\r\n\"Ay, ay, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"Brace those foreyards sharper up; set the fore and main staysails\r\nand foretopmast staysail; and keep her a point or so further off the\r\nland.--And now, Jack, come below, for Cuffy has gone down with the\r\nbacon and coffee, piping hot, too.\"\r\n\r\nLeaving Hans, the second mate, in charge of the deck, with orders to\r\nannounce the slightest indication of a change of wind, we descended\r\nto breakfast with the appetites of hawks.\r\n\r\nOn this morning only two of our sealing companions were visible, and\r\nthese were at the far horizon to the eastward; so as we were forced\r\nby change of wind to hug the land, we soon lost sight of them, and,\r\nere noonday, were alone upon the sea.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nKIDD THE PIRATE.\r\n\r\nWe had scarcely lost sight of Cape St. Francis when the wind became\r\nlight and variable, and one of those dense fogs peculiar to that\r\nregion settled surely and slowly, densely and darkly, over land and\r\nsea.  We shortened sail, and sent ahead the jolly-boat with four\r\nhands in her, to feel our way as it were; while Paul Reeves kept\r\nsounding ever and anon, for in that ocean of strong currents, with a\r\nslight wind from the eastward, and a shore of reefs and shoals upon\r\nour lee, every precaution was necessary.\r\n\r\nThe raw cold of a fog upon a wintry sea in that latitude of ice and\r\nsnow must be felt to be understood.  The clear bracing frost, however\r\nintense, may be endured; but this chill and murky dampness made one\r\nintensely miserable.\r\n\r\nAs we crept along, a strange sound reached us from time to time.\r\n\r\n\"What is that?\" I asked.\r\n\r\n\"The voices of the penguins,\" replied Hartly--\"the Baccalao birds.\r\nWe are off that island; and their cries are as good as fog-guns to\r\npeople situated as we are.  See! the fog lights a bit; and now there\r\nis the land about two miles off, on the lee bow!\"\r\n\r\nAs he spoke, the dense bank of vapour which shrouded sea, land, and\r\nsky, parted for a few minutes; a gleam of brilliant sunshine fell\r\nupon the rough and precipitous rocks of the wild and desert isle\r\nnamed Baccalao, which, in summer and winter, are alike ever whitened\r\nby a species of guano, deposited there by the auks or penguins, which\r\nwe could see hovering above them in countless myriads, uttering\r\nshrill cries while they soared, wheeled, and flew hither and thither,\r\nas if to warn us of our danger in being so near those treacherous\r\nreefs, which are a source of terror to mariners.  Their dangers are\r\nonly seen, however, by the daring egg-gatherers, who come from the\r\nmainland in summer, and sling themselves by ropes from the summit of\r\nthe cliff, to rifle the nests; although these poor birds are\r\nspecially under the protection of Government, by a proclamation,\r\nbeing sea-marks, or danger-signals (as we found them) in foul or\r\nfoggy weather.\r\n\r\nWith some interest I surveyed the stern cliffs of Baccalao, as they\r\nwere the first land seen by Cabot, the Grand Pilot of England, after\r\nploughing the mighty Atlantic in his little caravel; and he named\r\nthem in his joy _La Prima Vista_, though a \"vista\" grim enough.\r\n\r\n\"The shore is dark, dreary, and sterile,\" said I to Hartly.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said he, \"but there are many strange stories of treasure being\r\nburied there by the pirates in old times.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you see that deep chasm in the rocks in the north end of the\r\nisle?\" said Paul Reeves, lowering his voice impressively as he\r\npointed to the land.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, it seems quite black among the snow.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is _not_ snow, but the deposit of the Baccalao birds,\" said the\r\nmate.  \"In the old buccaneering times, the pirates are said to have\r\nburied their treasure there; and a cask branded with the King's broad\r\narrow, and the name _Adventure_, was once found in it.  Now all the\r\nworld knows that the _Adventure_ was the ship of the famous Captain\r\nKidd, who cheated King William out of the finest craft in the English\r\nnavy.\"\r\n\r\n\"How?\" said I.\r\n\r\n\"Let us hear,\" added Hartly.\r\n\r\n\"At a time when all the seas about the coasts of North and South\r\nAmerica and the West India Islands were swarming with buccaneer\r\ncraft, manned by desperadoes of every country, who made war upon all\r\nships that sailed the ocean and were unable to resist them, the\r\nGovernment of King William III. selected a mariner of doubtful\r\nreputation, named Captain William Kidd, who volunteered to root out\r\nthose sea-hawks, who persecuted the thrifty traders of New Amsterdam.\"\r\n\r\n\"King William acted on the principle of setting a thief to catch a\r\nthief.\"\r\n\r\n\"Exactly so, Jack,\" said Hartly, \"for Kidd, though ostensibly a\r\nmerchant-mariner, was something of a smuggler, and had done a little\r\nin the way of picarooning.  He was always heard of in out-of-the-way\r\nplaces, departing on voyages no one knew whither, and coming from\r\nplaces never heard of before.  Then he was always followed by a crew\r\nof well-armed, black-muzzled, drinking, swearing, tearing fellows,\r\nwho were as flush of money as if they had been at the overhauling of\r\nHavannah.  But go a-head, Paul.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" resumed the mate, \"in 1695 Kidd sailed down Channel in the\r\n_Adventure_ galley, of forty-four guns, with a royal pennant flying,\r\nduly commissioned by King William to fight all buccaneers, and his\r\ncrew were all selected by himself.  But Master Kidd was barely off\r\nthe Lizard when he hauled down the King's pennant, hoisted the skull\r\nand crossbones, and bore away for the East Indies.  He burned two\r\ntowns in Madeira, and after plundering and sinking every craft he\r\ncould overmatch, reached the entrance of the Red Sea, where he\r\ncaptured a Queda merchantman, the cargo of which lined the pockets of\r\nhimself and his followers to their complete satisfaction.\r\n\r\n\"Queda is a town of Asia, situated on the western coast of the\r\npeninsula of Malacca; and so Kidd was cunning enough to attempt\r\npassing-off this capture as a crusade against the enemies of\r\nChristianity; but, unfortunately for him, the ship was commanded by a\r\nScotchman, and people did not believe in crusaders under Orange\r\nWilliam.\r\n\r\n\"A year or two after this, he was cruising off the American coast,\r\nand in dread of the King's ships, which were all on the look-out for\r\nhim, he ran north as far as Newfoundland, and was alleged to have\r\nburied on its coast all the treasure amassed on his long and rambling\r\nvoyage; but _where_, no one could exactly say, until the old barrel\r\nhead, marked _Adventure_, and bearing the King's broad arrow, found\r\nin yonder cavern, seemed to indicate Baccalao as being the place.\r\nMoreover, he is known to have run up Conception Bay in quest of the\r\ngold and silver rocks which Frobisher and Sir Humphrey Gilbert\r\naverred were to be seen there.\"\r\n\r\n\"Rocks of gold and silver!\" said I, incredulously.\r\n\r\n\"They are only the fire-stones of the Red Indians, and emit sparks\r\nwhen struck together,\" said Hartly.[*]\r\n\r\n\r\n[*] They were the solid iron pyrites which deceived the early\r\nnavigators who visited these barren shores.  In the \"List of H.M.\r\nRoyal Navy for 1701,\" we find among the \"fifth-rates, the\r\n_Adventure_, 120 men, 44 guns.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\"His treasure,\" continued the mate, \"if he had any, was never found;\r\nthough _he_ was, for Richard Coote, Earl of Bellamont, and Governor\r\nof New England, caught him one day in 1701, when swaggering about the\r\nstreets of Boston, and sent him home to King William, who lost no\r\ntime in hanging him.  But he died as hard as he had lived, for the\r\nrope broke with his weight in Execution Dock, so he was reeved up\r\nagain with a new one.\r\n\r\n\"He was hung in chains on the banks of the Thames, but his body\r\ndisappeared in the night, and the sailors in London declared that he\r\ncould neither be hanged nor chained, as he had a _charmed_ life,\r\nhaving sold his poor soul to the devil.  Be that as it may, on the\r\n_same night_, in 1701, my Lord Bellamont was found dead in his bed at\r\nBoston, and many affirmed that this event had some connexion with\r\nKidd's mysterious disappearance from the gallows, as he was said to\r\nhave been seen by some of his old shipmates near the dead Governor's\r\nhouse.\r\n\r\n\"Fishermen when jigging or trawling off Baccalao in the clear\r\nmoonlight nights, often saw a solitary man sitting on the rocks at\r\nthe mouth of yonder cavern, but his figure always seemed to melt away\r\ninto the moonshine when any one approached; so a story went abroad\r\nthat the island was haunted by the ghost of a drowned man.  However,\r\na stout fellow, named Tom Spiller, who was rather bolder than the\r\nrest, and who lived alone at Breakheart Point, where he had a little\r\nhut and stage for drying the fish he caught, went off to the island\r\none night, when there was little cloud and a bright moon.  The sea\r\nwas calm, for there was but a puff of wind off the land from time to\r\ntime.\r\n\r\n\"Tom Spiller was a brave and devil-may-care kind of fellow, whom I\r\nknew well, for he was an old man when I went to sea with him first as\r\na boy, so I have often heard him tell the story without variation or\r\nleeway, or shaking out a new reef by way of a change.\r\n\r\n\"On approaching the island, he saw the solitary figure sitting on the\r\nrocks at the mouth of the deep black chasm, motionless, with his head\r\nresting, as it were, sorrowfully on the palm of his right hand, and\r\nhis eyes fixed apparently on the sea that rippled to his feet, though\r\nit boiled and roared in white foam over the reefs that lay a few\r\nfathoms off outside.\r\n\r\n\"Tom steered his boat straight for the cave, and now, when the\r\ntowering rocks of the desert isle were over his head, covered with\r\nthousands upon thousands of wild auks, screaming, whirling, and\r\nflapping their wings, as if to scare him away; when the deep black\r\nchasm in which the sea was gurgling and moaning yawned before him,\r\nand everything seemed so weird and wan in the pale moonlight, he\r\n_did_ feel queer, and more so when the solitary man, instead of\r\nmelting into thin air as usual, turned his white face towards him,\r\nand arose, just as he let go the halyards, lowered the brown flapping\r\nsail, and running his boat into the cave, adroitly noosed a rope over\r\na large stone to moor her, and stepped ashore.  Tom's heart was\r\nbeating wildly and strangely, for he was determined to discover\r\nwhether this figure, which he had so often seen from the sea, and\r\nwhich had so invariably eluded his brother fishermen, was man, ghost,\r\nor devil.\r\n\r\n\"He perceived that the stranger was clad in an old-fashioned dress,\r\nhis coat having large metal buttons, broad pocket-flaps, and deep\r\ncuffs.  He was ghastly pale, his glassy eyes glistened in the\r\nmoonlight, and dark crimson blood was flowing from what appeared to\r\nbe a pistol-shot in his left temple.\r\n\r\n\"'What seek you here?' he asked, in a voice so hollow that the\r\nterrified fisherman, who now repented sorely of his rashness, knew\r\nnot whether the sound came from the spectre's white lips, from the\r\ndepth of the dreary chasm, or from the sea.  'Speak,' continued the\r\nfigure, with mournful earnestness; 'what seek you?'\r\n\r\n\"'To discover who and what you are,' said Tom.\r\n\r\n\"'May you never be what I was, or what I am,' replied the other,\r\nsadly.\r\n\r\n\"'But what are you?'\r\n\r\n\"'A restless spirit.'\r\n\r\n\"Tom's knees bent under him, for the pale eyes of that cold white\r\nvisage seemed to pierce his soul.\r\n\r\n\"'A wretched spirit--left here by a fiend to guard his ill-gotten\r\nspoil--so begone, I charge you.'\r\n\r\n\"The fisherman shrank back on hearing these strange words, while the\r\ngloomy terrors of the scene--the screaming of the Baccalao birds that\r\nwhirled in a cloud about him, the dashing of the waves upon the reef,\r\nand the mournful gurgle of the backwash within the vast cavern, with\r\nthe weird glimpses of the moon as the white clouds sailed swiftly\r\npast her face--all combined to make this interview a dreadful one.\r\n\r\n\"Suddenly there was a sound of oars to seaward, the spirit seemed to\r\nbecome excited, and clasped his thin white hands.\r\n\r\n\"'See! see! he comes!' he exclaimed.  'Kidd the pirate!  Kidd, my\r\nmurderer!  But he comes, blessed be God! to release me after a\r\nhundred years of restless watching and penance!'\r\n\r\n\"For you must know that this occurred, as Tom Spiller told me, in\r\n1801.\r\n\r\n\"'Land ho!' cried a deep hoarse voice from the sea, while Spiller,\r\novercome by terror, shrank behind a fragment of rock.\r\n\r\n\"'Hilloa!' answered the spirit, in nautical fashion.\r\n\r\n\"'Clouds and thunder! why the devil don't you show a light?' cried\r\nthe strange voice, as a large barge full of men shot round a\r\npromontory, against which the waves were dashing in foam.  On it\r\ncame--on and on--at every stroke of the oars, till they were all\r\ntriced up in true man-o'-war fashion as she sheered into the creek,\r\nand a man sprang on shore, uttering a tempest of oaths and\r\nmaledictions.\r\n\r\n\"Tom Spiller now fancied that they were all dressed in the fashion of\r\na hundred years ago, with deep square-skirted coats, long flowing\r\nperriwigs, and little three-cocked hats, and that all were pale,\r\nsilent, and spectral; in short, it was a boat manned by unquiet\r\nspirits!  Strangely enough, he felt less afraid of them _all_ than of\r\n_one_, and continued to gaze at them like a person in a dream.\r\n\r\n\"The man who sprang ashore was a short, squat fellow of ferocious\r\naspect; his battered visage was covered with cuts and patches of\r\nblack plaster; a hellish spark glittered in each of his eyes.  He\r\nwore a coarse perriwig with long curls, a three-cocked hat, an\r\nold-fashioned blue coat, covered with tarnished lace, and brass\r\nbuttons; he had also a pair of brass-barrelled Spanish pistols, and a\r\nhanger sustained by a broad belt.\r\n\r\n\"_Two_ ropes were knotted round his neck, which was bare, and pieces\r\nof rusty chain were dangling at his wrists and ankles.  Then the\r\nmarrow froze in the bones of Tom Spiller, for he knew that he looked\r\nupon William Kidd, the pirate, who had been _twice_ hanged a hundred\r\nyears before in Execution Dock.\r\n\r\n\"'Now, you canting, cowardly lubber, why the henckers didn't you hang\r\nout a light?' he bellowed in a hoarse voice.\r\n\r\n\"'I have been in the dark these hundred years,' replied the spirit,\r\nmeekly.\r\n\r\n\"'Likely enough; seas and thunder! you were the faintest-hearted\r\nfellow in the _Adventure_.'\r\n\r\n\"'I suffered sorely at your hands since you captured the ship of\r\nQueda, of which I was captain, and made me a prisoner in yon galley.'\r\n\r\n\"'Bah!' thundered Kidd.\r\n\r\n\"'I have repented me of my sins in life,' said the spirit, mournfully.\r\n\r\n\"''Sblood and plunder!' shouted the other, with a diabolical laugh;\r\n'I shot you through the head, as a canting Scotsman, on this night\r\none hundred years ago, and buried you here--you know for what\r\npurpose.'\r\n\r\n\"'That my unquiet spirit might watch your buried treasure,' moaned\r\nthe other.\r\n\r\n\"'Right,' chuckled the pirate; 'I shot you as I would have done my\r\nlord the Earl of Bellamont, though he was Governor of New England and\r\nAdmiral of all the seas about it, for that long-snouted Dutch lubber,\r\nWilliam of Orange, who sent him to lord it over the Yankees.'\r\n\r\n\"'I have waited and watched your treasure long, and now am anxious\r\nfor the repose of the grave.'\r\n\r\n\"On hearing this, Kidd and his boat's crew laughed, and gnashed their\r\nteeth; but a few there were who wept and wailed heavily, and the\r\nsound of their lamentation was fearful as it mingled with the chafing\r\nof the surge.\r\n\r\n\"'I have some fine things stowed away here in Baccalao,' said Kidd;\r\n'but I have some that are better still in the haunted Kaatskill\r\nMountain, and at Tapaan Zee, up the Hudson.'\r\n\r\n\"The spirit-watcher groaned.\r\n\r\n\"'Since I saw you last, brother, I have been twice hanged and strung\r\nin chains on the banks of the Thames--ha! ha! at Gravesend Reach.'\r\n\r\n\"'Hanged!'\r\n\r\n\"'Yes, by all the devils in New Amsterdam!--HANGED!  Hanged by order\r\nof him of pious, glorious, and immortal memory--by Orange Billy, who\r\nassassinated the De Witts in Holland, who murdered eighty men, women,\r\nand children in cold blood in Scotland; who abandoned his soldiers at\r\nSteinkirk; who boiled and burned women alive in London for coining a\r\nfew brass halfpence; and who departed this life amid the prayers of\r\ncanting hypocrites and lawn-sleeved parasites, on the 8th day of\r\nMarch, 1701!  He roasts now, for some of his pranks, I can tell you!\r\nBut heave a-head, brother! we must ship our cargo, and be off\r\nto-night for Cape Cod at New Amsterdam (or New York, as the folks\r\ncall it now-a-days), ere the moon wanes or the tide falls.  Where is\r\nthe plunder?'\r\n\r\n\"The sad spirit-watcher pointed to a place which seemed to have\r\nopened in the rocky cavern; and there Tom Spiller could see, by the\r\nbeams of the moon, heaps of gold and silver vessels, sparkling jewels\r\nand trinkets, with veritable pyramids of gold and silver coins of\r\nevery nation and of every size, piled up in confusion.\r\n\r\n\"Bewildered by this sight, he permitted rather too much of his figure\r\nto be seen; for suddenly a yell of rage came from the spectre boat's\r\ncrew; and Kidd, drawing one of the long brass pistols from his broad\r\nbuff girdle, uttered a dreadful oath--\r\n\r\n\"'A spy!' he exclaimed; 'take _that_ and perish!'\r\n\r\n\"He fired full at the head of Tom, who felt the ball pass through his\r\nbrain like a red-hot arrow, and he sank upon the rocks--where he\r\nfound himself lying stiff enough when he awoke next morning, and saw\r\nthe Baccalao birds wheeling about in the sunshine.\"\r\n\r\n\"So the whole affair was only a dream!\" said I.\r\n\r\n\"I cannot say,\" replied Reeves; \"for strangely enough, an old Spanish\r\npistol, with a strong smell of powder about it, and 'W. K.' on the\r\nbutt, was lying on the rocks by his side.  Tom lost no time, you may\r\nbe assured, in jumping into his boat, and clapping on all sail to\r\nleave the island astern; but after that night the spirit was seen no\r\nmore at the mouth of the cavern, for Kidd had come to release him, or\r\nto take away his treasure.\"\r\n\r\n\"And Tom Spiller?\"\r\n\r\n\"Forsook his hut at Breakheart Point, and went to sea for many years:\r\nhe felt unhappy, for the parsons say that folks always are so who\r\nhave conversed with ghosts; but his mind dwelt for ever on the\r\ntreasure in the cavern, and he never ceased to spin yarns about it,\r\nand express hopes that some, if not all that he saw, might yet\r\nremain.  He returned to Breakheart Point about twenty years ago, an\r\nold and white-haired man; and one night, accompanied by three men\r\narmed with picks and shovels, sailed in search of the treasure; but\r\nthey never reached the island, for a tempest came on and drove their\r\nboat to the northward.  He tried to fetch Ragged Harbour, but was\r\nblown right across Conception Bay for more than thirty miles, and was\r\ndrowned at La Cabo Bueno Vista, on a rock called, to this hour,\r\nSpiller's Point.\r\n\r\n\"As for Captain Kidd, he has never been seen since, though some folks\r\nhereabout say he commands the _Black Schooner_, which has overhauled\r\nso many of our merchantmen and escaped the Queen's cruisers.  So that\r\nis my yarn, Mr. Manly.\"\r\n\r\n\"Steady, Paul, steady,\" said Hartly; \"the fog has concealed your\r\nhaunted island again.\"\r\n\r\n\"Steady it is, sir; but we had better take a pull at these larboard\r\ntacks, otherwise we may not be able to clear the three rocks that lie\r\nto the northward of Baccalao; and I think we can hear the breakers\r\nalready!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nTHE BLACK SCHOONER.\r\n\r\nLong ere the mate's story was concluded, the dense fog--chilly,\r\nwhite, and drenching--had shrouded the dreary isle of Baccalao, and\r\nthe voices of the penguins alone indicated its locality; but they\r\nbecame fainter, until we lost the sound altogether as we ran further\r\nto the north.\r\n\r\nNow a furious snow-storm came on; thick and fast the white flakes\r\nfell ceaselessly aslant through a dark-grey sky upon the winter sea\r\n(for in that region there is _no_ spring), covering the rigging, the\r\ndecks, and storm-jackets of the watch, who shrank to leeward, while\r\nthe wind, which blew keenly from the N.N.E., and thermometer, which\r\nhad sunk very low, made me begin to reflect that there were more\r\nunpleasant places in the world than the counting-room of Mr. Uriah\r\nSkrew.\r\n\r\nThis snow-storm continued for three or four days, during which the\r\nwhole seamanship of Hartly, Reeves, and Hans Peterkin was required to\r\nprevent the _Leda_ being driven upon a lee shore.  By chart and\r\nsoundings they were constantly at work, to keep her off a land which\r\nwas veiled in obscurity, for the wind was dead and strong against us;\r\nand frequently through the blinding snow, and grey hazy drift to\r\nleeward, we could hear the sullen booming of breakers, as they rolled\r\nin foam that froze upon the granite rocks and islets about Cape\r\nFreels.\r\n\r\nThis foul weather lasted for several days, and weary of beating\r\nfruitlessly to windward, when the storm abated, and the sky became\r\nagain blue and serene, we found ourselves under easy sail, at the\r\nrate of four knots an hour or so, passing the Twillingate Isles,\r\nwhich lie between the Bay of Exploits and the vast Bay of Notre Dame.\r\nThey were covered with snow, and are desolate, bleak, and little\r\nknown, as on that part of the coast there are only about one hundred\r\nand fifty inhabitants--poor people--who, after fishing for cod and\r\nsalmon in summer, quit their wigwams in winter to live in the\r\nsheltered woods, or sail south towards St. John.  And now we began to\r\nget ready our boats and guns, and with telescopes to sweep the\r\nsnow-clad shore for seals, and the open sea for ice-floes.\r\n\r\nIt was about the hour of six; the sun had just set, and the western\r\nsky was all a-blaze with fiery-coloured light, which tinged with\r\nroseate hues the waves that rolled upon the bleak and snow-clad\r\nshore.  Captain Hartly took the wheel, and Reeves stood anxiously\r\nclose by the binnacle, for we had to weather a long, sharp, and lofty\r\npromontory which abutted like a wall of rock into the ocean, and\r\nround which there eddied a swift and dangerous current.  The wind,\r\nthough now off the land, was too light to enable us to make headway\r\nagainst the stream.\r\n\r\nOn the brig we had but little \"way,\" and a general exclamation of\r\nsatisfaction rose from the hitherto silent crew, when the _Leda_\r\n_shaved_--as they phrased it--past the promontory, and we saw a deep\r\ncove of blue water opening beyond it; but lo!\r\n\r\nThere lay at anchor a schooner--a long, low, sharply prowed and\r\nrakish-like craft--with her hull painted black as jet could be, and\r\nwith a number of rough-looking fellows crowding along her gunwale.\r\nWe were not three hundred yards apart.\r\n\r\n\"Reeves, take the wheel,\" cried Hartly, in an excited voice.  \"The\r\nglass, Cuffy, the spy-glass!\" he added with sharp energy, snatching\r\nfrom the hands of Snowball the telescope which usually hung on two\r\nhooks in the companion; \"a row of ugly dogs they are that man her.\r\nBy Heaven, she is the _Black Schooner_!\"\r\n\r\n\"The _Black Schooner_!\" we all exclaimed with something of dismay in\r\nour varying tones; and I felt, that with Paul Reeves's grim legend\r\nabout Captain Kidd fresh in our memory, we had some cause for alarm\r\nin meeting with this robber ship upon those solitary seas.\r\n\r\n\"Are you sure, Hartly?\" I asked.\r\n\r\n\"Not a doubt of it!  see, Reeves--she is a two-topsail schooner!\"\r\n\r\n\"What does that mean?\" said I.\r\n\r\n\"A brig without tops, in fact.\"\r\n\r\nA kind of growling cheer, mingled with wild and insolent halloing,\r\nrose from her crew on beholding us suddenly come round the abrupt\r\npromontory, from the brow of which a fringe of gigantic icicles\r\noverhung the sea.  A commotion was instantly observable on deck; a\r\nman in authority sprang up the companion-ladder, and we heard him in\r\na loud and clear voice ordering sail to be instantly made on the\r\nschooner as we altered our course.\r\n\r\n\"Man the windlass-bars--up anchor--rouse it to the catheads with a\r\nwill, my boys!  Shake out everything fore and aft--every stitch that\r\nwill draw.  Stand by the jib and flying-jib halliards,\" he shouted.\r\n\r\nAfter a pause, during which we heard the clanking of the windlass\r\npauls, as her anchor was started, and would soon be a-cockbill, and\r\ndangling by its ring, we heard his voice again.\r\n\r\n\"Up with the jib and flying-jib now--sheets to starboard!  Heave and\r\naway--presto! my Jack Spaniards.  Stand by topgallant and topsail\r\nsheets and halliards.  Bear a hand, you French devils!  Well done, my\r\nKentucky rowdies!\"\r\n\r\nIn less than three minutes the swelling of the jib and other\r\nhead-sails, as well as the motion of the schooner when her bows fell\r\nround, proved that she was under weigh.  These orders, which were\r\nobeyed with skilful alacrity, seemed to indicate alike the mixed\r\ncharacter of her crew and the hostility of their intentions.\r\n\r\n\"Ready a gun there forward! sheet home and hoist away, topsails and\r\ntopgallant sails!\"\r\n\r\nThis alarming order, uttered in a loud voice, rang distinctly upon\r\nthe clear frosty air, and, on the other hand, Captain Hartly was not\r\nslow in his preparations to avoid her.\r\n\r\n\"By Jove!\" he exclaimed, \"this is the very craft we have heard so\r\nmuch about, and for the capture of which the Governor offers 500_l_.\r\nI have no wish to be caught by these fellows--see, they are shaking\r\nout a couple of reefs in her fore and aft mainsail already!  Hands\r\nmake all sail--Reeves, set everything that will draw--square away the\r\nafter yards.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ay, ay, sir,\" said Reeves, jumping about and setting all the men to\r\nthe yards, braces, and halliards; \"port the smallest bit--keep her\r\nfull--so--steady!\"\r\n\r\n\"Maldito los Inglesos renegades!\" (\"Curse the English runaways!\")\r\ncried a Spaniard, shaking his clenched hands at us over her starboard\r\nbow.\r\n\r\n\"Caramba!\" cried another.\r\n\r\n\"Sangbleu!\" added a Frenchman, \"stop hare--lie to--or it vill be ze\r\nvorser for you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Will it, you rascally thief!\" shouted Hartly, as his eyes flashed\r\nand his cheek glowed with excitement: \"Manly, look alive, my lad!\r\nload all the double-barrelled rifles in the cabin.  Snowball, get up\r\nthe kegs of powder and slugs.  We shall not be overhauled by a pirate\r\nwithout having a skirmish first.\"\r\n\r\n\"Luckily for us the wind is off the land, and it freshens too,\" said\r\nReeves: \"we shall beat her when running before the wind; but she\r\nwould come up with us hand over hand on a taut bowline.  It was on a\r\nwind she overtook the Bristol clipper.\"\r\n\r\nIn the red glow of the winter sunset, we saw the foam flying on each\r\nside of her sharp bows as the breeze freshened, and she rolled\r\nheavily from side to side; while the _Leda_, being square-rigged, had\r\na greater spread of canvas, and caught more of the wind: thus,\r\nnotwithstanding that our dangerous pursuer was built for sailing\r\nfast, as Paul Reeves foretold, she was no match for us, when running\r\nright before the wind.\r\n\r\nOur crew, half of whom were only poor seal-fishers, became very much\r\nexcited; but inspired by the example of Hartly, Reeves, and myself,\r\nthey proceeded to load all the sealing guns and muskets, lest the\r\nschooner might lower her boats to overtake us and attempt to board.\r\n\r\nThe stern and confident order to get \"ready a gun,\" was repeated more\r\nthan once before we got beyond hearing; but as no gun was ever fired,\r\nwe believed this to be a mere bravado to frighten us into shortening\r\nsail, till she might run alongside and board us, when a ruinous scene\r\nof plunder, if not of bloodshed, would be sure to ensue.\r\n\r\n\"She sails with the speed of an arrow,\" said I, while carefully\r\nloading and capping my rifle.\r\n\r\n\"This _Black Schooner_ was one of the craft employed in protecting\r\nthe French fishery of Miquelon, on the south side of the island,\"\r\nsaid Hartly; \"but her crew mutinied, shipped some runaways of all\r\ncountries and colours, and turned slavers.  These rascals have\r\ncommitted several outrages hereabouts by sea and land, but have\r\nalways escaped our cruisers, as she alternately shows a British,\r\nFrench, and Yankee ensign, and runs all kinds of paint-strokes along\r\nher bends.\"\r\n\r\nOn, on, we bore; and on, on, she came after us, with the still\r\nfreshening breeze, the foam flying before her bows and ours; but ere\r\nlong we were evidently half a mile apart.\r\n\r\nShe was a handsome clipper-like craft of about two hundred tons'\r\nburthen, coppered to the bends; her lower masts were long and heavy,\r\nso as to carry fore and aft sails of immense spread upon a wind, with\r\na square sail, top and topgallant sail aloft.\r\n\r\n\"Massa Hartly--Massa Captain--look out!\" exclaimed Cuffy Snowball,\r\nwho had armed himself with a musket, and stood in soldier-fashion at\r\n\"the ready,\" grinning over the taffrail at the rolling schooner.\r\n\r\n\"Look out for what?\" said Hans Peterkin.\r\n\r\n\"Something make you all look white as de debbil.\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you mean by _white_,\" asked the carpenter, \"when we all know\r\nthe devil is black?\"\r\n\r\n\"In my country him white, sare,\" replied Cuffy, angrily.\r\n\r\n\"Then,\" said Hartly, to keep up the spirits of his crew by jesting,\r\n\"what colour do you think he is, Cuffy?\"\r\n\r\n\"I tink him _blue_,\" replied the prudent negro; and then he added\r\nwith a yell, \"dere come something will make you look blue too, Massa!\"\r\n\r\nAs he spoke, a puff of white smoke rose from the bow of the _Black\r\nSchooner_; the report of a musket rang in the air, and a conical\r\nrifle-ball whistled past the ear of Hartly, and sank with a heavy\r\n_thud_ into the mainmast.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nTHE CHASE.\r\n\r\nCuffy Snowball fired his musket at our pursuer, whether with or\r\nwithout effect we know not; but, in reply, a confused discharge of\r\nfirearms followed, and the balls pattered among the rigging, and\r\nknocked little splinters from our spars and gunwale.\r\n\r\n\"Now, my lads,\" said Hartly, \"let fly at her with everything you\r\nhave--sealing-guns and rifles!\"\r\n\r\nThis order was executed with alacrity.  We had four good rifles and\r\nten long-barrelled and wide-muzzled sealing-guns, each of which sent\r\nten or twelve slugs of lead _whirring_ through the air at every\r\ndischarge, and we blazed away right valiantly at the crowd of rascals\r\nin the schooner's bows; but so great was the distance between us,\r\nthat I am certain our fire fell harmlessly into the sea--the rifle\r\nshots alone could have told with effect.\r\n\r\nOn first deliberately levelling my rifle (a fine Enfield, presented\r\nto me by my father on leaving Peckham) at a man in the starboard bow\r\nof the pirate, a strange sensation came over me!\r\n\r\nI lowered my weapon and paused; but a shot that struck one of the\r\ndavits at which the stern-boat hung, removed my momentary, and at\r\nthat unpleasant crisis most unnecessary scruple.\r\n\r\nI levelled again--fired and reloaded, and without considering whether\r\nor not I had killed a man, continued to pepper away with all the\r\ncoolness and precision of Cuffy Snowball, the ex-corporal of H.M.\r\nWest India Regiment.\r\n\r\n\"Run up our ensign, and let her rascally crew see it while there is\r\nlight,\" said Hartly.  \"Paul Reeves, rig out the lower studding-sail\r\nbooms forward, and bring aft those two carronades and the small\r\nanchor, to trim her more by the stern.  Tom Hammer, see to this!\"\r\n\r\n\"Ay, ay, sir,\" was the ready response.\r\n\r\nThe orders were promptly obeyed.  The small anchor and two little\r\nguns, for which we unfortunately had only powder for signals, were\r\nbrought aft; the sharp bows of the _Leda_ thus rode more easily over\r\nthe water.  The lower studding-sails were rapidly spread and hoisted\r\nup; and then we flew through the darkening sea till its water seemed\r\nto smoke alongside, and bubbled in snowy froth under the counter,\r\nleaving a long white wake, like that of a steamer, astern.\r\n\r\nClosely in this long wake followed our pursuer, with deadly\r\npertinacity.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to convey in words any idea of the excitement of\r\nthis chase--this flight and pursuit--this race of rivalry, of life\r\nand death!  The daring ruffians who manned the schooner had committed\r\nseveral murders and robberies on sea and land.  They had overhauled\r\nand rifled several merchant ships, carrying off compasses, charts,\r\nprovisions, watches, money, and everything of value: thus, to have\r\nundergone such a ransacking at their hands--even if our lives were\r\nspared--would effectually have marred our expedition for that year.\r\n\r\nThey were evidently well armed, for their rifle-balls flew thick and\r\nfast about us.  The cracking report, and the _pingeing_ sound of the\r\nconical shot that followed every red flash which broke over the sharp\r\nbows of the schooner, added considerably to our anxiety to escape,\r\nand to our exasperation at being thus molested on the high seas, and\r\nwithin two hundred miles of where we had left one of her Majesty's\r\nsloops of war in the harbour of St. John, but frozen in,\r\nunfortunately.\r\n\r\nThough these missiles struck the brig's stern and rigging\r\nincessantly, we had only one man hit--an Irish seal-fisher, who had\r\nleft a wife and family at Dead Man's Bay, to try his fortune with us\r\nin the North.  A ball pierced his shoulder, smashing the collar-bone;\r\nand the poor fellow sank on the deck with a shrill cry of agony.  A\r\nlad named Ridly had his cheek grazed by another shot.\r\n\r\nThe dusk was fast increasing; but the red flush of the winter sunset\r\nyet lingered in the western sky; the snow-clad islets that stud the\r\nBay of Exploits had assumed a dark purple hue, and the sea through\r\nwhich we were careering, northwest, towards the Bay of Notre Dame,\r\nwore a deep and sombre blue.\r\n\r\nClearly defined against the dusky and ruddy sky, we could see the\r\npursuing schooner, her tall slender spars swaying from side to side,\r\nwith every stitch of snow-white canvas spread upon them; and she tore\r\nthrough the waves like a giant bird, swimming in the wake of dead\r\nwater that ran like a long path astern of us.\r\n\r\nWe had everything set aloft and alow; to her very trucks the _Leda_\r\nwas covered with swelling canvas, and she was a beautiful sight!  The\r\nkeen and anxious eyes of Hartly, who was at the wheel, scanned ever\r\nand anon the taut cordage, the bending masts, and then he would cast\r\na fierce glance astern.\r\n\r\n\"We are leaving her fast, sir,\" said Paul Reeves, confidently; \"in\r\nanother hour we shall be far enough apart to feel comfortable.\"\r\n\r\n\"Bravo, my little _Leda_!\" responded my friend; \"she is trimmed and\r\nmasted to perfection!  You see, Jack, how a square-rigged craft has\r\nthe advantage over even a sharp little serpent with a floating sheet,\r\nlike that rascally schooner!\"\r\n\r\nHer crew still continued to blaze at us with their rifles; but ere\r\nlong the bullets fell far short, for we were now more than a thousand\r\nyards apart, and with cheers of derision we continued to surge\r\nthrough the darkening ocean.\r\n\r\n\"If we had only possessed a few round-shot, we might have knocked\r\nsome of their sticks away with these two useless carronades,\" said\r\nHartly, as he now relinquished the wheel to Hans Peterkin, his second\r\nmate, and ordered glasses of grog to be served all round.  \"Corporal\r\nCuffy, do you think you could have knocked her mainboom away, when\r\nthe sea is so smooth?\"\r\n\r\n\"Like to knock all him brains out!\" replied the Congo-man with a\r\nsavage grin; for, inspired by some of his old African instincts,\r\nSnowball was the only person on board who regretted that we had not\r\nenjoyed a hand-to-hand conflict with these outlaws.\r\n\r\nBut now the darkness of the descending night, together with the\r\ngathering clouds and haze, concealed the schooner from us.\r\n\r\nWe extinguished all lights on board, and ere long when a red spark\r\nabout seven miles astern indicated that she was still tracking us,\r\nHartly took in his studding-sails, reduced the canvas on the brig,\r\nbrought his larboard tacks on board, and bore up for Cape St. John,\r\nthe boundary of the French shore, to land our wounded man, who was\r\nsuffering great agony from his compound fracture, and with whom, as\r\nwe had no medical officer, it would have been impossible to pursue\r\nour voyage.\r\n\r\nThis rencontre, chase, and escape, formed a staple topic for\r\nconversation to all on board, and till the night was far advanced no\r\none thought of turning in.\r\n\r\nWhen day broke we found ourselves close in shore, on the northern\r\nside of the great Bay of Notre Dame, with Cape St. John bearing about\r\nthree miles off on our lee bow.  We swept the sea with our glasses,\r\nbut not a sail was visible in the offing, nor all along the snow-clad\r\ncoast.  Save Cuffy Snowball, all expressed their satisfaction at\r\nthis; but we were not yet entirely done with our sable acquaintance,\r\nthe _Black Schooner_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nOUR REVENGE SCHEMED.\r\n\r\nWe came to anchor, handed our topsails, but merely hauled up our\r\ncourses, so as to be ready for sea at a moment's notice.  We were in\r\na little sheltered cove, abreast of a small village of wooden huts,\r\nsurrounded by fences that were buried deep in the frozen snow.\r\n\r\nThese huts, like all others in this wild terra nova, were built of\r\nfir-poles with the bark on, braced or pegged closely together, and\r\nhaving chimneys of rough stone built without mortar.  Bark and sods\r\nformed the roofs, and all the crevices were carefully caulked with\r\nmoss and mud.\r\n\r\nThere, in a wretched and dreary region, dwelt--and, I presume, still\r\ndwell--a little Irish colony of fifty or sixty poor souls, who fished\r\nfor cod in summer and seals in winter, each family herding together\r\nfor warmth in the same apartment with their pigs, fowls, and the\r\nshaggy dogs which dragged in harness the stunted trees that formed\r\ntheir fuel, and which were cut in the adjacent bush--the desolate\r\nplace which once formed the summer hunting-grounds of the extinct Red\r\nmen of the island.\r\n\r\nOur anchoring in the cove was a great event--the entire population\r\ncame forth to gaze and their dogs to bark at us.\r\n\r\nThough Newfoundland is larger than England and Wales together, it is\r\nindented by broad bays of deep water, which run for forty or fifty\r\nmiles into the interior, and are but little known.  On some of these\r\nsolitary shores are little stations of Europeans, such as this we\r\nvisited, so remote from all intercourse, and so secluded, that their\r\nreckoning of time has become confused as to days, months, and even\r\nyears; thus Sunday is frequently held by them in the _middle_ of a\r\nweek.\r\n\r\nTo the care of these pioneers, or squatters, we consigned our wounded\r\nman.  By the intensity of the frost mortification had commenced, so\r\nthe poor fellow died a few days after being landed.\r\n\r\nWe had scarcely conveyed him ashore, when a man arrived from the bush\r\nwith a large tree, which he had cut down, and which his dogs had\r\ndragged easily over the snow (after it was denuded of its bark and\r\nbranches) in the usual manner, by having their traces secured to his\r\nhatchet, which was wedged in the broad end of the log.  He informed\r\nus that a schooner--by his description, our identical _Black\r\nSchooner_--was then at anchor under the lee of the Gull Island, about\r\nfive miles distant; and added that the poor French people at La Scie\r\ncomplained bitterly of the rifling they had undergone at the hands of\r\nher crew, which consisted of forty well-armed desperadoes, of all\r\nnations, but principally English and Frenchmen.\r\n\r\nHere was startling intelligence!\r\n\r\n\"Only five miles distant, say you?\" reiterated Hartly.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir; and you may see Gull Island from the mouth of our cove\r\nhere.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are sure she is a schooner?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, with masts raking well aft.\"\r\n\r\n\"All black in the hull, with slender spars and double topsails?\"\r\n\r\n\"Sure as I now spake to yer honour,\" replied our informant, who was\r\nan Irish fisherman and squatter; \"her crew have let go both anchors\r\nto make all snug, and gone in a gang to enjoy themselves, or\r\nrob--which you plaze--I suppose it's all one to them, at La Scie; bad\r\nluck to them, and may the devil fly away with them all!\"\r\n\r\n\"Are they all gone?\"\r\n\r\n\"All except six rapparees, whom I could count from the bush where I\r\nwas hiding.\"\r\n\r\n\"Six--left as a deck-watch, I suppose?\"\r\n\r\n\"Just so; yer honour's right again.\"\r\n\r\n\"How long have you lived here?\" I inquired, for his brogue was as\r\nstrong as if he had only left his native Kerry yesterday.\r\n\r\n\"I have lived here, plaze yer honor, five-and-forty years this last\r\nSt. Patrick's Day, and have niver had an hour's illness, glory be to\r\nGod!\"\r\n\r\n\"Five-and-forty years!\" I reiterated, with a shudder, while surveying\r\nthe snow-clad wilderness amid which the wigwams stood.\r\n\r\n\"How far is La Scie from the Gull Island?\" said Hartly, after a pause.\r\n\r\n\"Six miles, capthin.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then by Heaven I'll burn her to the water-edge, or sink her at her\r\nanchors!\" exclaimed Hartly, who, with all the rapidity of his nature,\r\nat once conceived and prepared to execute a very daring scheme.\r\n\r\nWhile the quarter-boat was got ready, and four oars, with as many\r\nrifles loaded and capped, and a case of ammunition, were put into\r\nher, Hartly, with Paul Reeves, proceeded in the most simple and\r\nmethodical manner to prepare their apparatus for burning the\r\npiratical schooner.\r\n\r\nHe took a common ship-bucket, and secured an iron ring to the iron\r\nhandle, for a purpose to be afterwards explained.  He filled this\r\nbucket with pieces of rope and spun-yarn, well steeped in tar and\r\ngrease, mixing them with rosin and gunpowder.  They were nearly three\r\nhours in getting these combustibles prepared to their complete\r\nsatisfaction; and so impatient were they to put their scheme in\r\nexecution, that they would scarcely wait until dusk to make the\r\nattempt.  But the moment the sun set, Hartly issued orders to Paul\r\nReeves and Hans Peterkin to heave short on the anchor to get it\r\napeak, to cast loose the topsails, and prepare the jib for hoisting;\r\nand while he started along the coast in the quarter-boat, to follow\r\nhim under easy sail, keeping pretty well to windward of Gull Island,\r\nand out of sight of the schooner.  If the night became obscure, on\r\nhearing the report of a rifle a blue light was to be burned on board\r\nthe _Leda_, to indicate her whereabouts.\r\n\r\nWhile Paul Reeves got the brig under weigh, and, favoured by a very\r\nlight breeze, crept slowly out of the cove, Bob Hartly, with Hammer\r\nthe carpenter, Cuffy Snowball, and I, started in the sharp little\r\nquarter-boat, and aided by a current which there runs north to Cape\r\nSt. John, pulled swiftly along the shore towards Gull Island, which\r\nlies beyond the extremity of the headland.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nOUR REVENGE EXECUTED.\r\n\r\nThe evening, as it deepened into night, was calm and beautiful: as\r\nyet the moon had not risen, but the sky was clear, with an intensity\r\nand purity of blue that can only be found in the icy north, and\r\nstudded by ten thousand sparkling stars.  Some of these were so\r\nbright as almost to cast our shadows on the smooth water as we\r\nstretched to our oars, and swept along the snow-white coast.\r\n\r\nThe latter being nearly destitute of inhabitants, after we left the\r\ncove was voiceless, silent, and desolate.  Not a light was visible,\r\nand no sounds broke the stillness save the booming of the surf on the\r\nrocks of Cape St. John, our own hard breathing, and the clatter of\r\nthe oars in the rowlocks.  Then (as that is a species of noise which\r\nthe water conveys to a vast distance) we proceeded to muffle them by\r\nour handkerchiefs, and once more we stretched out vigorously.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the intensity of the cold, so invigorating was the\r\nexercise of rowing, and so full were our minds of excitement and of\r\nour project for destroying the pirate schooner, that we all felt in a\r\nglow of heat, and almost uttered a shout when, after pulling about\r\nthree miles, on clearing the bluff Cape of St. John, on the flinty\r\nbrow of which the spray was frozen white as it was dashed up by the\r\nsea, we saw the steep rocks of Gull Island; and at anchor, half a\r\nmile to leeward of it, the dark hull and tall spars of the _Black\r\nSchooner_!\r\n\r\nThe increasing light at one part of the horizon showed that the moon\r\nwould shortly be up, so we pulled with might and main to get close\r\nunder the lee of the island, and out of the long brilliant track the\r\nQueen of Night would shortly send across the rippling ocean.\r\n\r\n\"I might have brought an auger and bored a hole or two in her\r\nsheathing under water, and so have scuttled her quietly at her\r\nanchors,\" said the carpenter.\r\n\r\n\"But that boring would have kept us alongside too long,\" said Hartly;\r\n\"and the rascals might have got some of their plunder out before she\r\nwent down; moreover, your auger would have made too much noise.  But,\r\nhush! we are seen--two fellows are looking over her side!\"\r\n\r\n\"All her boats are gone,\" said I.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, to La Scie, except one at the stern.\"\r\n\r\n\"They are hailing us, sir,\" said Hammer.\r\n\r\n\"Hush!  I'll weather the ruffians yet,\" said Hartly.\r\n\r\nWe spoke in whispers, while our hearts beat like lightning, as we\r\nknew not the issue of our attempt, or the moment we might be fired on\r\nfrom her deck.  The schooner rode with both her anchors out, to make\r\nsure of her holding-ground in case a squall came suddenly on.  Her\r\ncanvas was neatly handed, her fore and aft foresail and boom mainsail\r\nwere tightly brailed up, and her topgallant yards sent down.\r\n\r\nThough black and sombre, with nothing light about her save her\r\ncopper, which shone brightly as burnished gold in the clear and\r\nstarlit sea, she was a beautiful little vessel; and Hartly almost\r\nsighed on thinking that he was about to destroy instead of capturing\r\nher.\r\n\r\n\"She is a lovely craft!\" said he, \"sharp at the bows as a needle\r\nbelow the water-line, clear at the counter, and coppered to the\r\nbends.  What a glorious yacht she would make!\"\r\n\r\n\"In sheering alongside, take care, sir, they don't scuttle us--by a\r\ncold shot, or a large stone,\" said Hammer.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" replied Hartly, \"my friend the Greenland witch said I should\r\nnever drown; but that does not prevent me from being shot, or hung\r\nfrom the schooner's topsail yard.\"\r\n\r\nAs we pulled round across her bows to starboard, keeping pretty well\r\noff, we were hailed again.\r\n\r\n\"Boat--boat ahoy! what are you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Fishermen,\" replied Hartly.\r\n\r\n\"From where?\"\r\n\r\n\"La Scie, where all your fellows are enjoying themselves.\"\r\n\r\n\"Got any feesh?\" asked a Frenchman.\r\n\r\n\"No--not at this season.\"\r\n\r\n\"Any zeels?\"\r\n\r\n\"Seals--no.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then prenez-garde, messieurs.\"\r\n\r\n\"Which means, in plain English, sheer off, d--n your eyes!\" growled\r\nthe first speaker; but by this time we were close under her starboard\r\ncounter.\r\n\r\n\"Sheer off, or it may be the worse for you!\"\r\n\r\n\"What the devil are you lubbers about under the counter?\" exclaimed\r\nanother; \"Baptiste, hand me a musket----\"\r\n\r\n\"We have dropped an oar, and our boat has run foul of yours,\" replied\r\nHartly; adding, in a whisper, \"The gimlet, carpenter--quick, the\r\ngimlet!\"\r\n\r\nIn less time than I have taken to write these last half-dozen lines,\r\nHartly had screwed the long gimlet into the vessel's side, under her\r\ncounter, and hooked on the bucket, through the iron ring which he had\r\nsecured to its handle, and there it hung close to the rudder and\r\nstern-post.  By the swift application of a single lucifer-match he\r\nfired the touch-paper that was to light the carefully-prepared\r\ncombustibles, the gathering flame of which shot upward from the\r\nbucket, and began at once to lick and flicker on the newly-painted\r\nplanking of the schooner.\r\n\r\n\"Shove off, and give way--for your lives, give way!\" said Hartly, in\r\na hoarse whisper.\r\n\r\n\"Cut away stern-boat--let hims all burn--agh! agh!\" grinned Cuffy,\r\nwho, by a slash of the knife which hung at his neck, cut adrift the\r\nboat which was moored astern.  We had not intended thus to destroy\r\nthe retreat of the wretches on board, but the African was merciless\r\nto his enemies, and we had no time to repair his severity.\r\n\r\n\"Give way,\" shouted Hartly, as soon as we were clear of her; \"clap on\r\ndry nippers!  By Jove! those lads of the knife and pistol will never\r\ncome athwart the hawse of the _Leda_ again!\"\r\n\r\nWe had not pulled ten strokes from her, ere a flame seemed to play on\r\nthe water beneath her counter!\r\n\r\nIt spread rapidly between the rudder and sternpost, burning through\r\nouter and inner sheathing; penetrating the rudder-case, and reaching\r\nthe cabin, which was unoccupied, as all the crew were ashore save the\r\nsix already mentioned, whom we saw loitering amidships.  One was\r\nprovided with a musket, which no doubt he would have discharged at\r\nus, had we lingered another moment alongside.\r\n\r\nSuddenly they raised a shout; then we saw them rush aft, when they\r\nimmediately discovered the vessel to be on fire, and that their only\r\nboat was adrift!\r\n\r\nHe with the musket took a long aim at us, and fired; but as we were\r\nnow three hundred yards from the schooner, and our boat was\r\nalternately rising and falling on the long rolling swell that heaved\r\nbetween Gull Island and Cape St. John, his shot fell far from us.\r\n\r\nBy this time the schooner was hopelessly on fire; her whole\r\nquarter-deck, stern, and cabin, forward to the mainmast, were sheeted\r\nwith red and roaring flame.  It spread along the deck; it leaped up\r\nthe well-greased masts like a fiery corkscrew, round the tarred\r\nrigging and over the handed canvas, till everything was in a blaze;\r\nthe great fore and aft sails fell from their brails like fiery\r\ncurtains; then we saw her two tall, slender spars, the long boom of\r\nher mainsail, her towering gaffs and topsail yards, all swaying\r\nto-and-fro, as the decks fell in and the shrouds sank smouldering\r\ninto the sea.  Then everything went to cinders fore and aft--aloft\r\nand alow!\r\n\r\nA lurid glare that outshone the light of the rising moon, overspread\r\nthe calm blue sea, casting a ruddy glow upon our faces as we paused\r\nupon our oars, close to the island, where the weird illumination\r\nscared all the sea-birds; thus we heard the shrill scream of the\r\nwagel or great grey gull, as he rose with booming wings and flew to\r\nseek the darker waters of the offing or the frozen bluffs of Cape St.\r\nJohn, on which the thundering breakers as they reared their heads,\r\ngleamed in the double light of red and silver, like showers of\r\ndiamonds and rubies.\r\n\r\n\"Jack--see how she burns!\" said Hartly: \"there goes her mainmast\r\ncrash into the sea--and now the foremast, a mass of whizzing sparks,\r\nwith all its top-hamper!  Pull for the island, till the brig comes\r\nabreast of it;\" and then cheerily he sang--\r\n\r\n  \"Haul away, pull away, pull, jolly boys!\r\n    At the mercy of fortune we go,\r\n  _We're in for it now_, and 'tis all folly, boys,\r\n    To be faint or downhearted, yeho!\"\r\n\r\n\r\nBy this time the schooner was a mass of fire, and burnt down nearly\r\nto her bends.  Through the flames we could see the blackened stumps\r\nof her timber-heads, standing in a row from stem to stern.  Suddenly\r\nthere was an explosion, and a mighty column of red and blue sparks\r\nand burning brands shot into mid air, arching over in every direction\r\nas they fell hissing into the sea.\r\n\r\nA quantity of powder had exploded on board!\r\n\r\nJust at that moment we beached our boat upon Gull Island, and\r\nascended the rocks in haste to view the result of our handiwork.\r\n\r\nA great cloud of smoke was now settling over her, as the flames\r\napproached the water; and beyond this cloud we could see a little\r\nboat with some men in it, pulling in the direction of Cape St. John.\r\nHartly was pleased on seeing this; for although he had resolved to\r\ndestroy the schooner, his heart reproached him for leaving six of the\r\npirates to perish in her.  One, no doubt, had swum after their\r\ndrifting boat, and brought her alongside in time to save his five\r\nshipmates; and then we laughed on thinking how cold his swim would be\r\nin the wintry waves, and of the baffled rage of the ruffians at La\r\nScie, left there without a vessel or any means of escape from a\r\ndesolate fishing-station, which in a week or two more would have,\r\nperhaps, three hundred miles of field-ice between it and the sea.\r\n\r\nA faint hurrah now came from seaward.  We turned, and saw the smart\r\nand saucy _Leda_ with her foresail backed flat to the mast, and her\r\nmaintopsail full and swelling--her straight sharp hull, and her taut\r\nrigging, in all its details, clearly and distinctly defined against\r\nthe vast silver disc of the moon, which seemed to linger as it rose\r\nfrom the flat horizon of the distant offing.  There was no need of\r\nshowing lights on board the brig, as we could see each other\r\ndistinctly, and also the burning pirate.  No flame rose from her now;\r\nbut a vast black pall of smoke enveloped all her hull.\r\n\r\nFrom the centre of this, there came a sound like a deep sob, as she\r\nfilled and went down.  Then when the smoky pall arose and melted into\r\nthin air, not a vestige could be seen of the _Black Schooner_!\r\n\r\n\"And now, my lads, away for the brig,\" said Captain Hartly, as we\r\ndescended from the highest part of the island to reach our boat,\r\npassing through deep snow, among thickets of dwarf firs and great\r\njuniper trees--over rocks covered with savin and frozen furze, where,\r\nin the short season of summer, the wild Indian tea called\r\n_wisha-capucoa_ grew plentifully, and where the beaver and the\r\nmusk-rat had their holes.\r\n\r\nAs we floundered down to the creek, a yell from Cuffy Snowball, who\r\nwas behind, startled us all.  A wild cariboo deer had rushed past\r\nhim.  How it came on the island puzzled us, for usually in winter\r\nthese animals seek the forests of the interior, till the sun of the\r\nbrief summer melts the snow, and enables them to browse on the scanty\r\nherbage of _the barrens_, as the cleared patches of moorland are\r\nnamed by the squatters.\r\n\r\n\"If the Governor adheres to his proclamation, this night's work adds\r\nfive hundred pounds to our profits,\" said Hartly, as the crew\r\nreceived us with hearty cheers; the headsails were filled, and we at\r\nonce stood off the shore.\r\n\r\nNext morning, when day broke, we could see by our glasses a band of\r\nmen assembled on the snow-covered summit of Cape St. John.\r\n\r\nThese were evidently the outwitted crew of the schooner; so, hoisting\r\nthe ensign at our gaff-peak, Paul Reeves dipped it to them thrice,\r\nironically bidding them farewell, as we stood away to the eastward to\r\nmake up for the time we had lost in being driven, by their attack and\r\npursuit, so far out of the course our captain first intended to steer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\nTHE SEAL-FISHERS.\r\n\r\nSome days after this event, we saw the dark blue of the sea flecked\r\nat the horizon by white spots.  These increased in size as we\r\napproached, and proved to be the floes, or detached portions of a\r\nvast field of ice, coming down from Davis' Straits, and with them\r\ncame masses of strange sea-weed, uprooted from the bottom of the\r\nocean, as some writers aver, by the mighty tusk of the male narwhal\r\nwhen searching for food.\r\n\r\nWe were soon amid the floes, and after passing through them, Paul\r\nReeves from the fore-crosstrees announced that he could discern the\r\nfield of ice, extending along the whole line of the horizon; and we\r\nsoon became sensible of its vicinity by a very perceptible increase\r\nof the cold, which ere long became almost unbearable.  But our\r\nseal-fishers prepared with alacrity for the great work of our little\r\nexpedition, by getting up their wooden clubs, their long\r\nsealing-guns, and shot-pouches; their knives, sledges, and\r\nrue-raddies or collar-ropes, by which to drag the loads of skins to\r\nthe brig, as they might have to pursue and slaughter the seals for\r\nsome miles from where she would anchor by the outer edge of the ice.\r\nThe inner, Hartly knew by his observations, partly rested on Wolf\r\nIsland, off the coast of Labrador.\r\n\r\nOn the detached floes, we saw a few seals like black dots; but on the\r\nice nearing the brig they always disappeared.\r\n\r\n\"There they go, souse into the water, tail up for old Greenland!\"\r\nsaid Hans Peterkin.  \"Now, Cuffy, get your fiddle in order.\"\r\n\r\n\"A fiddle!\" said I; \"for what?\"\r\n\r\n\"That you shall soon see, Jack,\" said Hartly.  \"Paul Reeves, get\r\nready a gang with the ice-anchor and cable!\"\r\n\r\nAs we neared the scene of our operations, we passed ten or twelve\r\ngigantic icebergs, the bases of which were merged deep in the icy\r\nsea.  Solemnly still, and intensely cold and pure they seem, to those\r\nwho first behold these voiceless floating mountains, so terrible in\r\ntheir form and whiteness, the shades of which are blue.\r\n\r\nBy a telescope, I perceived that some of them bore masses of gravel,\r\nfrozen mud, and even enormous boulder-stones, torn from the\r\nshore--but from what shore?\r\n\r\nFrom unknown and untrodden lands beyond the Arctic Circle--shores\r\nwhere, perhaps, the last of Franklin's fated crew are lying unburied\r\nsave by the eternal snow; and while I gazed on these floating\r\nislands, so awful in their aspect and solitude and so mysterious in\r\ntheir formation, there came to memory the oft-quoted words of the\r\nPsalmist, how \"they who go down to the sea in ships, and occupy their\r\nbusiness in great waters, see the works of the Lord, and His wonders\r\nin the deep.\"\r\n\r\nNo small care, skill, and seamanship were requisite to avoid those\r\nperilous \"wonders;\" but erelong we were close to the mighty field of\r\nice which covered all the ocean to the far horizon--a white and\r\ndesolate expanse, like a snow-covered moorland--varied only by the\r\nincessant hummocks, as those ridges of broken ice formed by the\r\ncollision of ice-fields, are named; or by the wavy outline or sharp\r\nspiral pinnacles of bergs which were wedged in the floating mass, and\r\nseemed to form the crags and mountains of this white and desolate\r\nworld of ice and snow.\r\n\r\nWe considered it singular, that up to this time we had not seen a\r\nsingle ship bent on the same errand, either of those which sailed\r\nwith us on St. Patrick's Day through the Narrows of St. John, or any\r\nof the steam sealers which leave the northern ports of Scotland about\r\nthe same season of the year.\r\n\r\nNow the quarter-boat was lowered, and Paul Reeves with her crew took\r\noff the cable and ice-anchor, which is formed like a pick-axe; the\r\ncourses were hauled up, the fore and aft mainsail brailed, the\r\ntopsails and topgallant sails handed, and we warped close to the\r\nice-field, fairly coming to anchor alongside its edge, just as we\r\nmight have warped close to a quay or wharf.\r\n\r\nThis was about ten in the morning of the 25th of March, and after\r\nreceiving a glass of stiff rum-grog per man, the whole of our\r\nseal-fishers \"landed,\" as they phrased it, on the ice, with all their\r\napparatus, including Cuffy with his violin; and, after, three hearty\r\nhurrahs for Captain Hartly, proceeded in quest of their prey, scores\r\nof which were seen dotting the white ice-scape (if I may so term it)\r\nwithin the distance of a mile from the brig.\r\n\r\nSeals of every species live or consort in droves along those desolate\r\nshores where the bergs and ice-fields float; and they are often found\r\nbasking in the rays of the sun.  Thus, when falling asleep they\r\neasily become a prey, though, when reposing, the seal is cunning\r\nenough to open its large black eyes from time to time, to see whether\r\nall is quiet around it.  The female produces two or three at a\r\nlitter, and feeds them for a fortnight or so on the shore where she\r\nhas brought them forth, suckling them in a position nearly upright,\r\ntill the fattened cubs depart to see the Arctic world upon the\r\nice-floes, and are old enough to search the waves for food.\r\n\r\nArmed with my double-barrelled rifle and a sheathed knife that\r\ndangled at my shot-belt, and well prepared to encounter the cold by a\r\nsuit of the warmest clothing (Flushing lined with English blanket), I\r\nset out alone in quest of adventures, feeling a strange emotion of\r\nmingled alarm and delight on finding myself afoot upon that frozen\r\nsea.  The intense purity and rarity of the atmosphere carried the\r\nvoices of our scattered men to a vast distance.  I could hear Cuffy\r\nvigorously scraping a hornpipe on his violin half a mile off; and\r\nthus won by the lyre of our sable Orpheus, the seals with their hairy\r\npaws (usually known as flippers), their round black heads, soft\r\ngleaming eyes, and spotted skins, from which the brine was dripping,\r\nbegan to appear in herds from subtle holes in the ice--holes through\r\nwhich I was frequently in terror of vanishing from mortal ken; and as\r\nthese strange amphibious animals rolled upon the field, turning up\r\ntheir full round bellies, which reminded me of those of gorged swine,\r\nI could see their bodies steaming in the frosty sunshine, for being\r\nwarm-blooded they emit at times a vapour.\r\n\r\nSeated on a sledge, under the lee of a hummock, Cuffy played\r\nvigorously; but how his black fingers could handle his instrument in\r\nsuch an atmosphere was beyond my comprehension, for though the glare\r\nof the noonday sun, as he shone through a cloudless sky, was almost\r\nblinding, the degree of cold was indescribable.  Ere long Snowball\r\nhad a numerous auditory, for music allures and fascinates these\r\nanimals, as it does many others; we are told how\r\n\r\n  \"Rude Heiskar's seal through surges dark,\r\n  Will long pursue the minstrel's bark;\"\r\n\r\nbut the moment our treacherous musician replaced his violin in its\r\ncanvas bag, an appalling scene of butchery began.\r\n\r\nThe batmen rushed about as if a frenzy had seized them, striking the\r\nseals on their round bullet-like heads, knocking them over, stunned\r\nand motionless.  Others followed, with long sharp knives, by _five_\r\nslashes of which the expert hunter will denude the largest cub of his\r\nsmooth glossy skin, to which the thick white fat adheres, and after\r\nbeing thus denuded, on more than one occasion I have seen the\r\nmiserable animal, bared to its slender ribs, when stung, as it were,\r\nby the intense frost reaching its vitals, revive for a minute, and\r\nmake efforts to crawl along the ice, or drop into the sea!\r\n\r\nThe whole ice-field, which a moment before had been so white in its\r\nspotless and untrodden purity, now, within the radius of a mile,\r\npresented the aspect of a battle-field, strewn with gashed carcases\r\nand heaps of bloody skins that were steaming in the sunshine.  Cuffy\r\nseemed in his element--in his glory!  Flourishing his long knife, he\r\nuttered yells as if every seal he stripped had been the Chenoo wife\r\nwho sold him into slavery, or the Yankee taskmaster whose whip had\r\nskinned _him_ more than once.\r\n\r\nThis wholesale butchery sickened me.\r\n\r\nThe attachment of the mother-seal to her offspring is very great; and\r\nhere I saw a great hooded one carrying off a little wounded cub in\r\nher mouth toward the edge of the ice-field, where they dropped into\r\nthe sea, escaping Cuffy, who pursued them.  There are times when the\r\nmother turns fiercely with tusks and claws upon the destroyers of her\r\nyoung, and then the long gun with its charge of slugs is brought into\r\naction; for on the _old_ seals (Buffon avers that some of them live\r\nfor more than a hundred years) the sturdiest batman's arm would swing\r\nthe knotted club in vain.  The membrane of the hooded seal can be\r\ndrawn over the nose, and inflated, so as to protect the head like a\r\nhelmet of gutta-percha.\r\n\r\nLeaving our people engaged in the work of slaughter, halloing,\r\nshouting, and encouraging each other, as they threw their bloody and\r\ngreasy spoil upon little sledges, to be dragged by ropes alongside\r\nthe brig, I proceeded over the hummocks in search of--I scarcely knew\r\nwhat.\r\n\r\nOur men seldom fired their guns, as shot destroys the skin, which,\r\nafter the cargo is brought into port, has the fat or blubber\r\ncarefully removed and placed in the great wooden tanks or vats of the\r\noil-merchant; while the pelts are cleaned, spread, and, after having\r\nlayers of coarse salt placed between them, are packed in bales for\r\ntransport to other countries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\nCOMBAT WITH A SEA-HORSE.\r\n\r\nWe continued to fish, or rather to hunt, the seals here with\r\nconsiderable success, warping the brig from day to day along the\r\nouter edge of the ice, between which and her side we placed strong\r\nand soft fenders; and the satisfaction of Hartly and his crew\r\nincreased in proportion as the piles of pelt and blubber replaced in\r\nthe hold the stone ballast which we had brought from the island of\r\nNewfoundland.\r\n\r\nI had shot a few refractory seals, but one evening, when the\r\natmosphere was singularly clear, I rambled far along the ice-field,\r\nfloundering and scrambling among the hummocks, in the hope of finding\r\nworthier game.  I was accompanied by one of the crew, a smart and\r\nintelligent lad from North Shields, named Ridly, who was armed only\r\nwith an ice-gaff.\r\n\r\nOne who has been among the countless waves and ridges of a frozen sea\r\ncan alone have an idea of the toil of travelling, even for a mile, on\r\nan ice-field.\r\n\r\nBut on this vast floating waste we failed to discern anything worth\r\npowder and shot, and so, worn with our fruitless and desultory hunt,\r\nafter wandering about for an hour or two, we turned our steps towards\r\nthe brig, which still lay at anchor by the edge of the field, about\r\nthree miles off, and the masts and yards of which formed the chief\r\nand sole feature in the flat and dreary prospect.\r\n\r\nThe sun had set, but there was a dusky red flush in the sky which\r\nmarked the place of his declension; and now the ice began to assume\r\nthe cold green tints of salt water when frozen, as the shadows of\r\nnight stole over the sky from the eastward like a crape mantle, and\r\none by one the stars came out in the deep blue dome above us.\r\n\r\nSliding, toiling, and scrambling on, we were endeavouring to reach\r\nthe brig, when suddenly Ridly and I uttered a mutual exclamation of\r\nalarm, paused, and shrunk back.\r\n\r\nIn our front we heard an astounding roar, as of an earthquake, and\r\nlo! between us and the brig--between us and our friends, our home\r\nupon the waters--there yawned a mighty fissure of zigzag form, that\r\nran east and west, and was about fifteen or twenty feet wide, as the\r\nice-field split under the influence of some atmospheric change!\r\n\r\nWe stood and gazed blankly into each other's faces on beholding this\r\nterrible barrier to our progression, and fearing that the ice might\r\nyawn as suddenly under our feet.\r\n\r\n\"Separated from all succour from the ship--alone upon the ice, and\r\nwith night coming on, what will become of us?\" said I, thinking aloud.\r\n\r\n\"God only knows, sir,\" responded my companion; \"but we must endeavour\r\nto reach the brig somehow.\"\r\n\r\n\"There goes a lantern up to her mainmast-head,\" said I, as a light\r\nwas hoisted swiftly by the ensign halliards.\r\n\r\n\"The captain is showing a signal to indicate her whereabouts.  He has\r\nheard the noise of the splitting ice.\"\r\n\r\n\"If a fog should come on!\" said I.\r\n\r\n\"Don't think of it, sir,\" said my companion, hastily; \"the night is\r\nas clear as if day were overhead.  So let us find the end of this\r\ncrack; it cannot be very far off.\"\r\n\r\nWe proceeded westward for more than a mile, being compelled to make\r\nmany detours to avoid falling into the water among the ragged floes\r\nor pieces of ice that lay along the margin of this zigzag fissure;\r\nbut, as it extended far away beyond the range of our vision, and\r\nseemed to widen, we were compelled after long consideration, and\r\nsuffering great anxiety, to retrace our steps and proceed eastward,\r\nin the hope of gaining the _east end_ of it, or at least of\r\ndiscovering a place so narrow that we might leap across without the\r\ndanger of immersion, which, in such a season and at such an hour,\r\nwould have been fatal, as our entire clothing would in an instant\r\nhave become a casing of ice.\r\n\r\nTo favour our efforts the moon now rose, ascending slowly from the\r\nedge of the vast plain of ice, and notwithstanding the peril of our\r\nsituation, her beauty filled me with a glow of pleasure and hope.\r\n\r\nFar over that waste--so wide, so desolate, and mysterious--fell her\r\nflood of silver light, so bright in its intensity, and redoubled by\r\nreflection from the snow.  It glittered on every rounded hummock and\r\nsplintered berg, and formed strange fantastic figures in their cold\r\ngreen shadows, elsewhere making prisms that seemed like fairy\r\ncrystals, or gemwork of rubies, emeralds, and silver.  Clouds of\r\nfleecy whiteness came up with her from the sea, and as she _waded_\r\namong them, I recalled the words of Sir Walter Scott:--\r\n\r\n\"There is something peculiarly pleasing to the imagination in\r\ncontemplating the Queen of Night when she is wading, as the\r\nexpression is, among the vapours which she has not the power to\r\ndispel, and which on their side are unable entirely to quench her\r\nlustre.  It is the striking image of patient virtue calmly pursuing\r\nher path through good report and bad report, having that excellence\r\nin herself which ought to command all admiration; but bedimmed in the\r\neyes of the world by suffering, by misfortune, and by calumny.\"\r\n\r\nWhile I felt something of the poetry of our situation and the beauty\r\nof the night, my more practical and prosaic companion was sensible\r\nonly of the danger we ran, and after a minute reconnaissance, assured\r\nme, with an exclamation of joy, that the split in the ice was\r\nnarrowing.\r\n\r\nWe were then four miles from the brig, the crew of which had sent\r\nmore lanterns aloft, and ever and anon burned a brilliant red or blue\r\nlight, for Cuffy Snowball was a great pyrotechnist.\r\n\r\n\"What is that?\" said I, as a strange sound reached us.\r\n\r\n\"I cannot tell,\" replied my comrade, as he toiled on, supporting\r\nhimself with his ice-gaff; \"I never heard it before, and don't like\r\nit at all, sir.  I wish we were on board,\" he added, shuddering alike\r\nwith cold and superstitious fear, as the sound came again and again\r\nfrom among the hummocks, and it was as weird and mournful to the ear\r\nas their aspect was to the eye.\r\n\r\nIt was a strange _mooing_, and gradually swelled into a bellowing as\r\nwe proceeded; thus it evidently came from the throat of a large\r\nanimal--but what species of animal could it be in such a place?\r\n\r\nWe were not left long in doubt, for on the centre of a narrow isthmus\r\nof ice, _over which lay our way to the ship_, as the fissure beyond\r\nit opened wider than elsewhere, sat a huge, dark monster of the deep,\r\nin which, on approaching it, I recognised (from pictures I had seen)\r\na sea-horse, or walrus, which the reader must remember is _not_ a\r\nseal, but a ferocious animal that can defend itself and frequently\r\ndestroys its assailants, and this one manifested not the slightest\r\nintention of making way for us.\r\n\r\nHe was fearfully pre-Adamite, or antediluvian, in his proportions,\r\nbeing fully twenty feet in length, and having a pair of tusks thirty\r\ninches long protruding from the mass of quill-like bristles which\r\ncovered (like a thick moustache and whiskers) his upper lips and\r\ncheeks.  Grimly and ferociously he regarded us with his deep-set\r\neyes, which glittered in the moonlight amid the square mass of his\r\nelephantine visage, and on beholding us, his hollow mooing turned\r\ninto a species of grunting bark.\r\n\r\nFinding that he obstinately barred our way, and, moreover, seemed\r\ninclined to attack us, I levelled my rifle full at his grizzly front\r\nand fired, while Ridly rashly and fatally charged him in the smoke\r\nwith his ice-gaff, which was armed with a sharp pike.\r\n\r\nMy ball had pierced his great sloping shoulder, pricking him as a pin\r\nmight have done, and serving only to incense him, for his bark\r\nchanged to a mighty roar, and when the smoke cleared away, I saw poor\r\nRidly, who had fallen, lying under one of his gigantic fore-flippers.\r\nThe foam of rage was frothing on the bristles of the sea-horse, and\r\nwith his two enormous tusks, which stood upward through them like two\r\ncrooked sabre-blades, he was alternately rending the limbs and body\r\nof his assailant and then great fragments of ice, which he dashed\r\ninto the water on each side of him.\r\n\r\nRidly had only power to utter a faint cry, when he expired.\r\n\r\nAppalled by this sudden and terrible catastrophe, I reloaded my\r\nrifle, and full of mingled rage and fear--a combination which made me\r\nno longer feel the intensity of the cold--I fired again and again at\r\nthe horrid front of the walrus; but every shot seemed only to\r\nredouble his wrath, and he continued to rend to pieces the clothes\r\nand body of Ridly, till in less than five minutes the ice around him\r\nwas covered by the blood of his victim and that which gushed from his\r\nown wounds.  Ridly's left leg he wrenched completely off, and cast\r\ninto the sea.\r\n\r\nRolling about in his wrath, and in his lubberly efforts to reach me,\r\nhe at last fell into the water; I then rushed across the narrow\r\nisthmus where my poor companion lay.  As I did so, the walrus made\r\nmany ineffectual efforts to reach me, grasping the ice with his\r\nforepaws, or dashing his vast shoulders madly against it, while he\r\nplunged and bellowed and covered all the water in the chasm around\r\nhim with mingled blood and foam, and, in his impotent fury, tore\r\ngreat blocks off the ice by the tusks of his lower jaw.\r\n\r\nI fired ten shots into his body, point blank, without his strength or\r\nwrath appearing to diminish in the least.\r\n\r\nOn perceiving this, a species of superstitious dread came over me,\r\nand turning away, I hastened towards the brig, which, as I have\r\nstated, lay about four miles distant, leaving my walrus to flounder,\r\nbellow, and drown in the moonlight.\r\n\r\nAnxiety to reach the vessel, lest I might be overcome by fatigue, or\r\nthat fatal drowsiness caused at times by intense cold, made me strain\r\nevery energy; and thus in a much shorter time than could have deemed\r\npossible, considering the alternately rough or slippery and laborious\r\nnature of the ice-field to be traversed, I found myself among the\r\ncarcasses of our slaughtered seals, and within hail of the _Leda_.\r\n\r\nFurnished with ice-gaffs, a bottle of rum, a sledge, and plenty of\r\nblankets, so as to be prepared for any emergency, Captain Hartly,\r\nwith Hans Peterkin and ten of the crew, met me, just as I was sinking\r\nwith fatigue, half sleepy and half delirious with cold.  Thus a\r\nconsiderable time elapsed ere I could relate the story of my\r\nadventure and our shipmate's death.\r\n\r\nThey had heard the roar of the splitting ice, and knew why we were\r\nwandering so long and so deviously among the hummocks, but the sound\r\nof firing puzzled them extremely; and thus, while Paul Reeves with a\r\ngang was hoisting out the jolly-boat upon a sledge, to have it\r\nlaunched in the chasm for our conveyance across, Hartly had come on\r\nin advance, and he met me just in time, for in ten minutes more I\r\nmust have perished of fatigue and cold!\r\n\r\nOn returning next morning to collect poor Ridly's remains and commit\r\nthem to the deep, we found his great destroyer dead, but floating by\r\nthe margin of the ice, to which he was literally anchored, or hooked,\r\nby his two longest tusks.\r\n\r\nBy this, and the affair with the _Black Schooner_, we had lost two of\r\nour crew.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\nON AN ICEBERG.\r\n\r\nSoon after this, in a dark and howling night, we were blown from our\r\nmoorings, and forced to run before the wind, with our topmasts\r\nstruck, and only our jib and a close-reefed foresail set, as we were\r\nin the dangerous vicinity of innumerable broken floes, or masses\r\ndetached from the field-ice: the decks were so slippery that one\r\ncould scarcely keep afoot; and amid the arrowy sleet and snow that\r\nrendered all so murky and obscure around us, and which stung the face\r\nlike showers of sharp needles, we were hurried on, expecting every\r\nmoment a collision which would stave our bows or snap the masts by\r\nthe board.\r\n\r\nWe were repeatedly frost-bitten in the ears, nose, or hands; but snow\r\nscraped up in the scuppers and promptly applied, soon brought a hot\r\nglow in the benumbed member, and proved our best, indeed our only\r\nremedy.\r\n\r\nAll who could cultivate beards had permitted them to grow in Crimean\r\nluxuriance, as any attempt at soapsudding in those latitudes produced\r\na coating of ice in a moment.\r\n\r\nSurging on through blinding drift and pitchy darkness, amid the\r\nhowling of the fierce tempest, the _Leda_ went bravely!  Her spars\r\nand cordage straining and groaning, her timbers creaking, while wave\r\nafter wave broke over her decks and hardy crew, each leaving its\r\nlegacy of ice upon everything.  From time to time we were conscious\r\nof a rude shock, or a furious scraping sound, as she grazed upon the\r\npassing floes; and now, to add to the gloomy horrors of that\r\ntempestuous night, Paul Reeves, who was keeping an anxious look-out\r\nforward, shouted back through his trumpet--\r\n\r\n\"Icebergs ahead!  Hard to port, or we are foul of one!\"\r\n\r\n\"Hard to port,\" echoed the two men at the wheel; sharply it revolved,\r\nand in a moment we swept under the frowning cliff of a stupendous\r\niceberg, the cold white mass of which was discernible through the\r\ngloom, as the arm of the mainyard grazed it!\r\n\r\nWe passed on and it vanished in the darkness astern.\r\n\r\n\"Thank Heaven!\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank God!\"\r\n\r\n\"A narrow escape!\"\r\n\r\nSuch were the muttered exclamations of our half-frozen crew; but at\r\nthat instant an icy sea broke over us, and two men were swept into a\r\nwatery grave, without the possibility of our rendering them the least\r\nassistance.\r\n\r\nA minute had scarcely elapsed before we were sensible of a fierce\r\nconcussion; the masts reeled and the icicles fell in a shower as they\r\nwere shaken from our stiffened top-hamper.  Then the brig's head was\r\ntilted up and her stern correspondingly depressed; but still impelled\r\nby the fury of the wind, she continued to advance upwards and _out of\r\nthe water_, as if she was being steamed up a landing-slip, or into a\r\ndry dock.\r\n\r\n\"We are ashore--beached!\" said some one, beholding this phenomenon.\r\n\r\n\"We are foul of an iceberg,\" exclaimed Hartly, while the brig\r\ncontinued slowly to ascend till little more than the sternpost and\r\ncounter were in the water; then she heeled over to port and remained\r\nthere, wedged, with her jib-boom broken off at the cap, and dangling\r\nin the jib-guys, her canvas bellying out so furiously that we thought\r\nthe masts would be carried away before the benumbed fingers of the\r\nseamen could get it handed.\r\n\r\nIn a trice the _Leda_ was under bare poles, while around us the\r\ntempestuous wind was bellowing, the surf was roaring, and vast blocks\r\nof ice, many tons in weight, were crashing against each other, adding\r\nto the dread horrors of this bewildering catastrophe!\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to depict the dismay of all on board, when finding\r\nthe vessel in this situation--high and dry upon a berg; for,\r\ninfluenced by the storm, by the wind, or the slight additional weight\r\nof the brig and her cargo, we felt the monstrous mass on which we\r\nwere wedged, _oscillating_ and gradually heeling forward ahead; thus\r\nthe stern of the _Leda_ was raised until her hull remained in the air\r\nhorizontally, just as she usually sat in the water.\r\n\r\nIn blank horror we endured the gloomy hours of that northern night,\r\namid the drift, the sleet, and a darkness so dense that we could in\r\nno way discover our real position, or how to extricate ourselves from\r\nit.\r\n\r\nOne fact, we were alarmingly alive to.  It was this:--The sea no\r\nlonger dashed against the hull of our vessel, which lay on her side,\r\nwell careened over to port; and though we could _hear_ the roaring of\r\nthe waves, amid the oppressive gloom that enveloped us, we could no\r\nlonger _see_ them.\r\n\r\nAs day broke the tempest gradually lulled, and the sleet, the snow,\r\nand wind passed away together.  Then the increasing light enabled us\r\nto see the perils of our situation.\r\n\r\nWe were nearly eighty feet above the ocean, on the flat, table-like\r\nsummit of a mighty iceberg; which, though it had presented a sloping\r\nface _up_ which we had run last night before the furious wind and\r\nsea, had now changed its position by heeling over, as icebergs always\r\ndo, from time to time, when their base in the ocean becomes\r\nhoneycombed and decayed.*\r\n\r\n\r\n* Her Majesty's steam ship _Intrepid_, when commanded by Captain\r\nCator, was similarly carried bodily up the face of a berg, and left\r\nhigh and dry in air, without injury.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe sky was clear now to the horizon; the icefield on which we had\r\npursued our hunting so successfully was no longer visible; but about\r\nhalf a mile distant lay the island of floating ice we had escaped\r\nlast night; and around for miles, far as the eye could reach, the\r\nsea, still perturbed by the past storm, was flecked by white floes,\r\nthe ruins probably of a third berg, which had been shattered by the\r\nwaves or by being dashed against others.\r\n\r\nBoth these icebergs were several miles in circumference.  The summit\r\nof ours was flat as a bowling-green; but that portion on which the\r\nbrig rested was soft, pulpy, and rotten by its long immersion in the\r\nsea.\r\n\r\nThe other had many spiral pinnacles, some of them being several\r\nhundred feet in height; and, save for the peril in which we were\r\nsituated, I could have admired the sublimity of that cold and silent\r\nmass--so dazzlingly white when the beams of the rising sun fell on\r\nit, so indigo-blue in its shadows--for it resembled a fairy isle,\r\nwhich had steep hills, deep valleys, and chasms all fashioned of\r\nalabaster; while around its base was a thick fringe of frozen foam of\r\nsnowy brilliance.\r\n\r\nWhile we were gazing upon it that morning, one of its loftiest\r\npinnacles, with a mighty crash, fell thundering into the sea.\r\n\r\nThe _Leda_ was soon frozen into the bed she had ploughed by her keel\r\nin the ice; and _how_ to get her launched again, _how_ to descend\r\nfrom our perilous eminence, were the questions we asked of each\r\nother, and which no one could answer.\r\n\r\nThe summit of the berg was nearly a mile in circumference, and, as I\r\nhave said, was more than eighty feet from the water.  This we\r\nascertained as a fact, though there was no small peril in venturing\r\nfrom the ship upon its surface, which was so glassy and smooth that\r\nin some places the lightest among us would have slipped off, as if\r\nshot by a catapulta, into the sea below.\r\n\r\nCouncil and deliberation availed us nothing.  Even Hartly, Reeves,\r\nand Hans, with all their united skill, foresight, and seamanship,\r\nfound their invention fail in suggesting any means of release.\r\n\r\n\"There is nothing for it but to wait the event,\" said Hartly, after a\r\nlong and solemn council.\r\n\r\n\"But suppose that we waited a month, captain,\" asked Reeves,\r\ngloomily, \"where would our provisions be?--where our fresh water?\"\r\n\r\n\"We may be driven south into warmer latitudes where the bergs melt\r\nrapidly in the sunshine.\"\r\n\r\n\"But we may be drifted north into latitudes where the bergs freeze\r\nharder, and where ice may close around us for ever,\" said Hans\r\nPeterkin.\r\n\r\n\"Or,\" said one of the seamen, who all crowded anxiously to this\r\nconference, which we held around the capstan-head, \"the berg may\r\n_capsize_, and what will become of us then?\"\r\n\r\n\"Hold hard, my lads,\" exclaimed Hartly, \"hold hard, and be stout of\r\nheart and cheery.  Remember that however miserable we may deem\r\nourselves, there is one Blessed Eye upon us--the eye of a kind, good\r\nGod,\" he added, uncovering his head reverently to the bitter frost,\r\n\"One who will never forget the poor sailor, if he is true to himself.\r\nThink of the 'sweet little cherub that sits up aloft,' as the song\r\nsays, and rail not at fate, for fate guides man neither at home nor\r\nabroad, at sea or on shore.  Put all your trust aloft, my boys, and\r\nhold on by poor Jack's best bower anchor!\"\r\n\r\nThis harangue was exactly suited to his hearers.  We tried to feel\r\nhopeful and trusting, and to have patience.  But we longed very much,\r\nnevertheless, to be free of the iceberg, and to have the blue sea\r\ndashing alongside once more.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\nON THE ICEBERG--THE MASSACRE AT HIERRO.\r\n\r\nIn this appalling situation we remained for ten days before any\r\nalteration in the position either of the brig or of the two icebergs\r\nwas perceptible.\r\n\r\nWe missed our lost companions sorely, for the death of a shipmate in\r\nhis hammock, or by falling overboard, makes a great impression on the\r\nsecluded survivors at sea.  His watery grave is in itself a fearful\r\nmystery, the depth of which we cannot realize or fathom.  No stone or\r\nmound marks the place where he lies; he is hurled, as it were, soul\r\nand body into eternity, and blotted out of existence like the bubbles\r\nthat break round the place where he sinks.\r\n\r\nDuring these ten days Hartly was indefatigable in his efforts to keep\r\nhis crew employed, and their spirits from depression.  Lest\r\nprovisions might become scarce, and our water fall short, he had\r\nportions of the seals, the hideous paws especially, cleaned,\r\nprepared, and pickled, while the snow and ice which adhered to the\r\nrigging was boiled down, and added to our supply of fresh water.  To\r\nsave our fuel, the fire for these purposes was fed with the fat of\r\nthe seals, and the blubber (so long as it lasted) of the gigantic\r\nwalrus I had slain.\r\n\r\nThe seal \"flippers,\" hairy and bloody, like the claws of a baboon\r\nhewn off at the wrist, made a very cannibal-like repast when\r\nfricasseed.  Remembering how I had shuddered on seeing such repulsive\r\ncarrion sold at a penny per bunch in the streets of St. John, I could\r\nscarcely digest such a meal; though Cuffy Snowball, when he made them\r\ninto sea-pies, rolled his eyes and grinned from ear to ear while\r\ndeclaring his handiwork \"de berry best dish in de 'varsal creation!\"\r\n\r\nOur rigging was carefully inspected and prepared for any emergency,\r\nas if we expected to make sail on the brig at a moment's notice; but\r\n_how_ was she ever to reach her natural element again?\r\n\r\nOn this subject, though we were wearied of it, conjecture became\r\nutterly _lost_!\r\n\r\nStill, like a brave fellow, Hartly left nothing unsaid or undone to\r\nkeep up our hopes, though his own sank at times.  Save the watch on\r\ndeck, he nightly assembled all hands in the cabin for companionship\r\nand also for warmth.  There he sang songs, (while Cuffy accompanied\r\nhim on the violin,) and told stories, or read aloud, and spoke again\r\nand again to the poor crest-fallen seal-fishers (who thought only of\r\ntheir wives and families) of their profits on the voyage, and the\r\nreward they would receive from the Governor of Newfoundland for\r\ndestroying the obnoxious _Black Schooner_; and of that affair he drew\r\nup a statement, to be attested by all on board.\r\n\r\nHis example was invaluable, for he had somehow acquired the greatest\r\ninfluence over all his crew.  \"It is pleasing to see a family, a\r\nfarm, or establishment of any kind (says Lorimer, in his \"Letters to\r\na Young Merchant-Mariner\") when, from long servitude, the assistants\r\nand domestics are considered as humble friends or distant relations;\r\nand independently of the kind feelings thereby occasioned and\r\ncherished, all seems to prosper with them.  Such a state of things is\r\nby no means unfrequent in this happy country, Britain; and I see no\r\ngood reason why the same attachment to the master and to each other,\r\nshould not be more frequent on shipboard; indeed, considering the\r\ndangers they are continually sharing, one is almost surprised that\r\nthey can _separate_ so readily.  How to obtain a kind but powerful\r\ninfluence over, and a devoted attachment _from_, a crew, is a secret\r\nworth our deep consideration;\" and Robert Hartly eminently possessed\r\nthis secret, which, in the desperation of our circumstances, proved a\r\npriceless gift to him and to us.\r\n\r\nEvery night one story or yarn produced others, and so the time passed\r\non, and peril was half forgotten.\r\n\r\nMost of these narratives were gloomy enough, however.  They told of\r\nships whose crews were all poisoned save one man, by partaking of a\r\nmysterious fish, or whose crews turned pirates, and slaughtered all\r\nwho opposed them; or of men who were marooned on lonely isles, and\r\nleft to perish miserably.\r\n\r\nHans Peterkin, an Orkneyman, could tell us of queer shadowy craft,\r\nmanned by spectres, demons, and evil spirits, who displayed lights to\r\nlure vessels ashore on Cape Wrath and the rocks of Ultima Thule, like\r\nthe wreckers of Cornwall and Brittany.\r\n\r\nThen Paul Reeves matched them by a curious tale of an enchanted\r\nisland in the Indian Seas, on which the lights of churches and houses\r\ncould be seen at night, and where the tolling of bells and the song\r\nof vespers could be heard, with many other sounds; but lo! as the\r\nship approached, the isle would seem to recede till it sank into the\r\nsea and reappeared _astern_!\r\n\r\nThen Tom Hammer, the carpenter, gave us a yarn of an ice-cliff in\r\nHudson's Bay that long overhung a whaler he was once serving in.  One\r\nday the cliff was changed in form, for a mighty piece had fallen from\r\nit into the sea; and wonderful to relate, there was seen a man's\r\nfigure among the ice--a man imbedded up there a hundred feet above\r\nthe sea.  Telescopes were at once in requisition, and they made out\r\nthat he was frozen--dead--hard and fast; but by his dress--a red\r\ndoublet, trunk-hose, and a long black beard--they supposed he was\r\nsome ancient mariner; and some there were on board who vowed he was\r\nno other than the famous voyager Hendrick Hudson, who discovered the\r\nbay, and was marooned by his mutinous crew in 1610.\r\n\r\nBut one night, when we were all nestling close together, muffled in\r\nour pea-jackets, and smoking, to promote warmth, a narration of\r\nHartly's far exceeded all that preceded it in interest, being a\r\nveritable occurrence, and by its barbarity singular.\r\n\r\n\"My grandfather,\" said he, \"as thoroughbred an old salt as ever faced\r\na stiff topsail breeze, was skipper of the _Dublin_, a smart little\r\nship of three hundred and fifty tons, pierced for twelve\r\nsix-pounders, being a letter of marque that fought her own way when\r\nthe way upon the high seas was somewhat more perilous than it is now.\r\n\r\n\"About the autumn of the year 1784--now a long time ago, my lads--she\r\nwas chartered as an emigrant ship for Canada, and sailed from the\r\nMersey with one hundred and eighty poor folks, half of whom were\r\nwomen and children, going to seek their bread in another laud; and a\r\ntroublesome voyage the old gentleman had with them, for foul weather\r\ncame on; many of his spars were knocked away, and then a heavy\r\nsickness broke out among the emigrants.  Their little ones died daily\r\nand were hove overboard, till those whose children survived became\r\nwild with fear and apprehension that theirs would follow next; and,\r\nto make matters worse, there was no doctor on board; for this was in\r\n1784, as I told you, and the lives of the poor were not worth much to\r\nany one, save themselves, in those old times.\r\n\r\n\"Well, my grandfather was a soft-hearted old fellow, and his heart\r\nbled for the poor people.  His sick bay was crammed, and the\r\nsailmaker's needle was never idle, but made one little shroud after\r\nanother till the man's heart sickened of the dreary task.  So, when\r\nfoul weather mastered the _Dublin_, and blew her out of her course,\r\nthe old gentleman put his helm a-lee and bore up for the Canaries,\r\nwhich were once called the Fortunate Isles, and came in sight of\r\nHierro, the most westerly of these islands, on the 6th December,\r\n1784.  He had his ensign flying; but knowing well what slippery\r\ndevils the Spaniards are, and that the _Dublin_ had rather a\r\nman-o'-war cut in her spars and bends, he hoisted a _white_ flag at\r\nhis foremast head, and so came peacefully to anchor about sunrise.\r\n\r\n\"The morning was beautiful; the shore was desolate, but fertile and\r\ngreen.  The poor emigrants were mad with joy at the sight of land,\r\nand in an hour or two he set them all ashore, about a hundred in\r\nnumber, on the smooth sandy beach.  Many of them were women with\r\ninfants in their arms or at their skirts--men supporting their young\r\nwives or old parents; and new life and health seemed returning to\r\nthem as they rambled on the sunny shore, or drank of the pure springs\r\nthat gushed from the rocks, and as they pulled the green leaves and\r\naromatic flowers, or the broad plantain leaves which always flourish\r\nbest near the sea.\r\n\r\n\"Meanwhile, my grandfather had triced up his portlids, and a gang\r\nwith buckets and swabs were busy cleaning, airing, and fumigating\r\nevery place fore and aft, ere the live cargo were shipped again at\r\nnight, when an unforeseen catastrophe took place----\"\r\n\r\n\"A catastrophe!\" said I; \"the ship was blown out to sea?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not at all,\" said Hartly, refilling his pipe.\r\n\r\n\"What then?\"\r\n\r\n\"His poor people were all dead ere nightfall.\"\r\n\r\n\"Murdered?\"\r\n\r\n\"Aye, in cold blood, as you shall hear.  They were all enjoying\r\nthemselves--the children were playing, gambolling and tumbling over\r\neach other in heaps on the warm sands; the women were busy washing,\r\ndressing and arranging each other's hair; the men smoking their\r\npipes, and talking, perhaps regretfully, of that jolly old England\r\nthey had left for ever and, it might be hopefully, of the new shores\r\nthey were bound for, when a long line of bright bayonets that\r\nglittered ominously in the sunshine, appeared suddenly upon the steep\r\nrocks which completely enclosed the sandy cove, and three companies\r\nof lubberly Spanish militia commanded by Don Juan Briez de Calderon,\r\nencircled them on all sides, save towards the sea, where the _Dublin_\r\nlay at anchor about three-quarters of a mile off.  The reason of this\r\nmilitary display I shall explain.\r\n\r\n\"False rumours of a plague said to be raging in Europe had reached\r\nthese isles, and filled the selfish and superstitious Spanish\r\ncolonists with such alarm, that Señor the Governor, fearing, or\r\npretending to fear, the strangers might bring it among them,\r\ninstantly convened la Mesa del Consejo--his council-board, as they\r\ncall it in their lingo--and quietly proposed to cut off all these\r\nvoyagers root and branch!\r\n\r\n\"Some of the councillors vigorously opposed a course so revolting,\r\nand pled the cause of the poor Inglesos, the rights of religion and\r\nhumanity, and called upon Don Juan to remember the honour of the king\r\nhe represented, and that he was the lineal descendant of that\r\nadventurous Don Diego de Hierro, of Old Castile, who had captured the\r\nisland in the days of Ferdinand the Catholic, King of Arragon,\r\nbestowing in memory thereof his own illustrious name upon it, and so\r\nforth.\r\n\r\n\"Señor Don Juan did not reply, but knit his fierce black brows,\r\nlighted a cigar, and puffed away with true Castilian imperturbability.\r\n\r\n\"'Señor el Gobernador,' urged a venerable Spanish friar, 'these poor\r\npeople who have landed on our shores, after a long voyage apparently,\r\nwe know not from whence, have been forced hither, as our mariners\r\naver, by those recent storms which have swept over the Canary\r\nIsles----'\r\n\r\n\"'What is all this to me?' growled Don Juan.\r\n\r\n\"'Simply, Señor, that it will be alike cruel and unjust to inflict\r\nthe penalty of death upon them all for this.'\r\n\r\n\"'Padre, they have transgressed the laws of Hierro,' thundered the\r\nGovernor.\r\n\r\n\"'Laws temporarily made by _yourself_--laws with which they can in no\r\nway be acquainted.  If they have sickness among them, let us send\r\ntents and supplies; but guard the avenues to the ground we may allot\r\nthem, until they are all re-embarked with their wives and little\r\nones.  I will myself go among them,' continued the old friar, warming\r\nin his merciful advocacy, 'and say that you will graciously afford\r\nthem succour, until the orders of the most illustrious señor, our\r\nGovernor-General at Teneriffe, can be obtained.'\r\n\r\n\"'_Silencio!_' thundered Don Juan, and rudely threw the remains of\r\nhis cigar in the old man's face; 'order out our troops--we shall\r\nmarch instantly and exterminate these dangerous vermin!'\r\n\r\n\"The drums were beat, and the militia, three hundred strong, with the\r\nvaliant Don Juan at their head, marched to where the poor visitors,\r\nignorant of the horrors that were impending, were still amusing\r\nthemselves upon the beach.  Some were gathering the brilliant shells,\r\nflowers, and leaves; others were filling little kegs and jars with\r\nthe pure spring water that poured over the ledges of rock.  The women\r\nwere sitting in groups, with their children gambolling about them;\r\nothers were gazing sadly on the evening sea, as if calculating the\r\nnumber of miles that lay between them and their old home; or the\r\nmiles they had yet to traverse ere they found a new one amid the\r\nforests of the western world.\r\n\r\n\"To gather them all together, the villanous Briez de Calderon\r\nprocured an empty sugar puncheon, and tossed it over the summit of\r\nthe cliffs on which his men were posted.  From thence, with a loud\r\nnoise, it rolled to the beach below.  Curiosity made all the\r\nloiterers rush towards it, as many of them thought it contained food,\r\nclothes, or other necessaries for them.  The men gave a hurrah, and\r\nwaved their hats in hearty English jollity to the crafty Spaniards,\r\nand gathered with the women and children around the puncheon.\r\n\r\n\"'Fire!' cried Don Juan.\r\n\r\n\"Savage as they were, the Spaniards paused a moment; but Don Juan was\r\nthe first to fire a musket, and observing that his men were still\r\nreluctant, he knocked one down with the butt-end, and threatened the\r\nrest with death if they disobeyed him.\r\n\r\n\"'Fire!' he shouted again, and then on the unsuspecting crowd there\r\nwas poured the concentrated volley of these three hundred miscreants;\r\nthus, in ten minutes the dreadful massacre was complete.  On the\r\nbeach all were lying dead and drenched in blood--husband and wife,\r\nparent and child--all save one woman, who, with her infant, concealed\r\nherself in the rocks, and her husband, who, with a ball lodged in his\r\narm, sprang into the sea and endeavoured to swim to the ship.\r\n\r\n\"Failing in this, faint with loss of blood, weary and despairing, he\r\nturned about and sought the shore, where he was hewn to pieces by\r\nsabres as he clung to a seaweedy rock.  On beholding this dreadful\r\nsight, his poor wife, who was concealed in a cleft of the cliffs not\r\nfar off, uttered a shriek of dismay, which drew the murderers, now\r\nflushed with blood, towards her.\r\n\r\n\"She was soon dragged out, and with his own dagger Don Juan stabbed\r\nher to the heart, and then killed the child, which he tossed into the\r\nsea beside its father!\r\n\r\n\"Paralysed by rage and astonishment, my grandfather and his crew saw\r\nall this from the deck of the _Dublin_.  They could see the red\r\nmusketry flashing from the rocks, filling all the little cove with\r\nslaughtered corpses and smoke.  They could hear the shrieks that were\r\nborne over the water on the evening wind; and after a time, when all\r\nwas still, they could see the beach strewn with dead bodies, and in\r\npossession of the Spaniards, who were stripping them, and who brought\r\nup field-pieces to fire on the _Dublin_.\r\n\r\n\"He hoisted his anchor and bore away; but on coming abreast of the\r\ncapital with British colours flying _above_ the Spanish ensign\r\n_reversed_, he pitched a few shot into it from his carronades, sunk\r\nthree craft at their anchors, with all their crews on board, and then\r\nbore away for England, and there was an end of it.  We were at peace\r\nwith Spain; but I never heard that satisfaction was given, or the\r\natrocity revenged.  That is _my_ yarn, lads.\"*\r\n\r\n\r\n* The papers of the time fully corroborate Hartly's story.  \"The news\r\nof this barbarity,\" says the Annual Register for 1785, \"has been\r\nreceived at Teneriffe by all ranks of people with the deepest concern\r\nand regret, and by none more than the Governor-General, who deplores\r\nit extremely.  He could not at first give credit to it; but was at\r\nlast convinced of the fatal truth, by letters from the wretch Briez\r\nde Calderon himself.  Exasperated to the highest pitch, he has given\r\na commission to an officer of rank to go over to Hierro to take\r\ncognizance of this tragical affair,\"--of which we hear no more.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\nESCAPE FROM THE ICEBEBG.\r\n\r\nThough our apprehensions were great, our chief sufferings were from\r\ncold in that lofty and listless situation; yet our dread of impending\r\ndangers was so keen, our hope of a change so great, that even the\r\noldest seamen on board never turned into their berths or bunks at\r\nnight but with their clothes on, \"to be ready,\" as they said, \"to\r\nturn up with all standing at a moment's notice.\"\r\n\r\nHartly, who was rather scientific and was wont to expatiate upon the\r\ntheory of storms, and so forth, endeavoured to account for the\r\nintensity of the frost, which I deemed a somewhat unnecessary\r\nillustration to us who were on the summit of an iceberg.\r\n\r\n\"The thermometer--\" he would begin.\r\n\r\n\"Ugh! don't speak of the thermometer, Bob,\" said I, one day, when\r\ntrembling in every fibre, as we endeavoured to tread to and fro on\r\nthe sloping deck.  \"It is so cold now, that the atmosphere can never\r\nbe colder!\"\r\n\r\n\"So you think; but wait until--\"\r\n\r\n\"When?\"\r\n\r\n\"--we are a few degrees further north, perhaps in the centre of an\r\nice-field, and then you will know what cold is!  But the _degree_ of\r\nit depends upon the power of the wind, after passing over\r\nsnow-covered wastes, rather than the actual state of the\r\nmercury;--that was all I was about to remark.\"\r\n\r\nI was too miserable to thank him for the information, but said:\r\n\r\n\"I do not think our vicinity to that other atrocious iceberg adds to\r\nthe pleasantness of our temperature.\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course not--but see,\" he added, raising his voice, \"by Heaven, it\r\nis oscillating!\"\r\n\r\nJust as he spoke, the cold, glistening, and splintered peaks of the\r\nmighty berg seemed to topple over and sink into the sea, as it\r\n_reversed_ with a stunning roar--its former base coming upward, and\r\nimparting an entirely new form to it.\r\n\r\nAll on board stood gazing at this reversal, which is a common\r\noccurrence with icebergs; but it filled us with a horror of what\r\n_our_ fate would be should a similar capsize occur with us, for now\r\nthe berg on which we were wedged heaved and surged in the foaming\r\neddy made by the other.\r\n\r\n\"Icebergs have usually nine times as much of them below water as\r\nappears above it,\" said I.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, and at that ratio, if this one of ours reversed, we should find\r\nourselves in a moment somewhere about six hundred and forty feet\r\nbelow the surface of the sea,\" replied Hartly, with a grim smile.\r\n\r\n\"Ay,\" added Paul Reeves, \"and our poor little _Leda_ would be\r\nadhering, keel upmost and trucks down, like a barnacle at the bottom\r\nof this vast floating island.\"\r\n\r\nOn the tenth day of our imprisonment, as I have elsewhere said, after\r\nrain had been falling all night in such torrents that we had battened\r\nall the hatches fore and aft, on day breaking, we found a very\r\nperceptible alteration in the position of the brig.  From careening\r\nover to port, she had gradually righted, and now rested fairly on her\r\nkeel, with her masts upright.  The summit of the berg had again\r\nbecome soft and pulpy on its surface, and the _Leda_ seemed to sink\r\nlower by her own weight every minute, while the ice on each side\r\nsloped upward, leaving her in a kind of valley; and so rapidly did\r\nthis state of matters go on, that in four hours the sides were nearly\r\neight feet above our deck, and suggested a new terror, that they\r\nmight collapse--close over, and freeze us in more hopelessly than\r\never.\r\n\r\nAs the rain abated, the berg began palpably to oscillate, that\r\nportion of it which lay under the brig's head, however, became\r\ndepressed, and then the rainwater and _sludge_ that had collected in\r\nthe valley where we lay, poured over its icy brow like a cataract,\r\nand we heard it thundering, as it fell into the sea below.\r\n\r\n\"She moves--the brig moves! she forges ahead!\" exclaimed Hartly, in\r\nan excited voice, as the berg careened over more and more, and we all\r\nstood pale, breathless, speechless, and rooted to the deck, expecting\r\na capsize that would bury her masts downward in the sea.\r\n\r\nThis change of position continued to progress, but very slowly.\r\n\r\nThere were about sixteen feet of ice from the cutwater of the _Leda_\r\nto the edge of the berg, and about forty from her stern-post to the\r\nedge in the other direction.\r\n\r\n\"If this depression forward continues slowly,\" said Hartly, \"we shall\r\nbe floating in the blue in two hours, my lads; clear away two\r\nhawsers, an ice-anchor, and kedge.  Stand by with the capstan-bars,\r\ncast loose the jib and foretopsail, to lift her head a bit, if the\r\nwind serves when she slips off, and then stand by the braces to sheet\r\nhome!\"\r\n\r\nThese orders recalled us to life, for they filled us with hope, and\r\ninspired us with activity.\r\n\r\nLed by Hartly, Hans Peterkin and two other adventurous fellows named\r\nAbbot clambered along the soft ice astern, and fixed there a kedge\r\nwith our strongest hawser, which was to be eased gently off the\r\ncapstan, as the brig continued to forge downward and a-head, for her\r\nmotion was a double one.  It was perilous work for these four brave\r\nmen, as the rain had rendered the face of the berg slippery as wetted\r\nglass; but Hartly was full of inherent courage, and in the excitement\r\nof the moment forgot all his superstition about his ring, the gift of\r\nthe reputed witch Jensdochter.\r\n\r\nHe was scarcely on board again, ere the depression continued so\r\nrapidly that the entire hull of the brig lay at an angle of\r\nforty-five degrees from the line of the water below--her bows being\r\nyet twenty feet distant from it.\r\n\r\nThis was a momentous crisis for us all!\r\n\r\nA deathlike stillness was every where on board; on our pale lips, as\r\nwe grasped the shrouds or belaying pins to preserve our footing; on\r\nthe mighty isle of ice, from the shelving summit of which we were\r\nabout to be precipitated; and from the lonely sea below, there came\r\nno sound; at least, we heard only its wavelets rippling against the\r\ncold, glistening, and glacial sides of our prison.\r\n\r\nSlowly the brig moved, as if to protract that time of agonizing\r\nsuspense.  Every man compressed his lips and stifled his breathing.\r\nWe seemed to speak our thoughts in silent and expressive glances, for\r\nall had the certainty now that in _three_ minutes more, we should be\r\nfloating on the free waters of the ocean, or foundered and sunk,\r\nheadforemost, far beneath them.\r\n\r\nFoot by foot she forged ahead, as the berg continued to heel over,\r\nand ere long our bowsprit projected in the air over the edge, and\r\nthen the bows, headboards, and cutwater!  The angle at which the\r\n_Leda_ lay was fearful; we could no longer work the capstan; I\r\nclasped it with my arms, and shut my eyes.  Then a heavy sob seemed\r\nto escape from me, as Reeves, by one slash with a sharp axe on the\r\ntaffrail, parted the stern warp, which recoiled with a crack like a\r\ncoach-whip.  Then followed a rushing sound--a mighty plunge, and the\r\nwaves dashed in foam on each side of us, as the _Leda_ shot off the\r\nberg, and went souse, bows foremost into the sea; but rising up\r\nagain, and shaking all the spray off her, as a duck would have done.\r\n\r\nThere was a deep silence after the shock and escape of this launch,\r\nand all seemed to await the signal to utter a hearty hurrah of joy\r\nand thankfulness for our miraculous preservation.  Ere long it burst\r\nforth, but Hartly cut it short by his orders to sheet home the jib\r\nand foretopsail, to set the foresail, fore and aft mainsail and\r\nmaintopsail.\r\n\r\nRapidly he was obeyed, and just as the _Leda_ fell off, and bore away\r\nfrom the dangerous vicinity of the ice-island, it capsized, as its\r\ncompanion had done, and with a roar, as if defrauded of its prey.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\nUNDER WEIGH ONCE MORE.\r\n\r\nThe chainbobstay under the bowsprit was snapped, our rudder was split\r\nand its pintles were started, but these defects were soon repaired by\r\nthe carpenter; and next day, at noon, Hartly and Reeves on comparing\r\ntheir observations, discovered that, unknown to ourselves, we had\r\ndrifted nearly one hundred miles towards the western coast of\r\nGreenland, so a look-out was kept for the field-ice, as they were\r\nanxious to complete their interrupted seal-fishing, to haul up for\r\nSt. John's, and then freight for Europe in the spring.\r\n\r\nPoor fellows! ...\r\n\r\nWe seemed to have returned to life once more.  Again we were dashing\r\nthrough the blue sea with a free sheet, with the white canvas\r\nbellying full upon the breeze; again, on waking in the morning, the\r\nfirst familiar sounds that met the ear were the decks undergoing\r\ntheir customary ablutions, by bucket and swab, and the rasping\r\nholystones; Cuffy singing some Congo melody as he lighted the cabin\r\nfire, the wind whistling through the rigging, the patter of the\r\nreef-points on the bosom of the swollen sails, the dashing of the\r\nspray over the sharp black bows, the occasional order issued on deck,\r\nthe clatter of the rudder in its case, and the bubble of the water as\r\nit frothed past under the counter.\r\n\r\nAll these spoke of our wonted life of activity, and of the _Leda_\r\nbeing under canvas.\r\n\r\nIn a day or two we descried the slender white line of an ice-field,\r\nstretching for miles along the horizon towards the north, and\r\napproached it under easy sail, as the fields usually drift southward\r\nat this season.  By the appearance of the ice and the state of the\r\nthermometer, we concluded this to be a much larger field than that\r\nfrom which we had been blown by the gale of wind.\r\n\r\nWhile Reeves got ready the ice-hooks, sledges, warps, and gangs of\r\nseal-hunters, with their bats, guns, and other apparatus, Hartly and\r\nI were treading to and fro talking of various matters.  I can\r\nremember that he was relating to me, how, in his last voyage with the\r\n_Leda_ up the Mediterranean, St. Elmo's blue and phosphorescent light\r\nhad enveloped fully three feet of her masts below the trucks, to the\r\ngreat terror of Cuffy Snowball, and others who were ignorant of the\r\ncause of that phenomenon, which lasted nearly an hour.  He was\r\nproceeding with his narration, when Tom Hammer, who was repairing\r\nsomething aloft, hailed the watch.\r\n\r\n\"Deck--ahoy!\"\r\n\r\n\"Hallo?\" responded Hans Peterkin.\r\n\r\n\"There is a craft wedged in the ice, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where away?\"\r\n\r\n\"About twenty miles off.\"\r\n\r\n\"How does she bear?\"\r\n\r\n\"On our lee bow.\"\r\n\r\n\"And what do you make her out to be?\"\r\n\r\nHammer stood on the main-crosstrees, with his left arm embracing the\r\nmast, and through his telescope took a long and steady glance with a\r\nsomewhat perplexed air at this vessel, which we could not see from\r\nthe deck.\r\n\r\n\"She is a brig with her topgallant masts struck.\"\r\n\r\n\"Indeed!\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" stammered the carpenter.\r\n\r\n\"What then?\"\r\n\r\n\"A ship with all her canvas unbent.\"\r\n\r\n\"Unbent! that is strange,\" said Hartly, shading his eyes, and peering\r\naway to leeward.\r\n\r\n\"No--now, sir, she looks like a brigantine, or hermaphrodite brig,\r\nwith her yards topped up in different ways.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you wish your nightcap sent up to you, Tom?\" said the mate,\r\ndrily; \"look again, perhaps she is the _Flying Dutchman_.\"\r\n\r\n\"Or the ghost of the _Black Schooner_,\" said one.\r\n\r\n\"Or a whale,\" added another.\r\n\r\nBut on nearing the edge of the ice-field--so close that we sent off\r\nthe mate in the jolly boat with the warps, and handed our canvas,\r\npreparatory to resuming the war against the seals--we could all see\r\nthe vessel which Hammer had discerned, lying among the ice about\r\nfifteen miles off, and various were the discussions on board as to\r\nher rig and nation.  Even our oldest seamen were puzzled.  Her hull\r\nwas scarcely visible, so high were the hummocks around her.  She had\r\ntwo masts, but her spars were, as Tom said, topped up in various ways\r\nand at various angles, and seemed covered by long-accumulated ice and\r\nsnow, from which we augured that she had been long beset.\r\n\r\nWe hoisted our colours and displayed the private signal of Messrs.\r\nManly and Skrew, but received no response, by which we supposed that\r\nshe had been deserted by her crew, or that her signal halliards had\r\ngiven way.\r\n\r\nSome averred stoutly that they could distinguish a flag flying at her\r\ngaff peak; others that she had no gaff peak whatever, but had _one_\r\nman seated in her fore rigging.  Hartly ridiculed these fancies,\r\nsaying that the intensity of the cold, and the dazzling glare of the\r\nsun shining on a sea covered by white ice, bewildered the vision of\r\nmost men; and so, full of vague conjectures as to what our neighbours\r\nmight be, we saw the sun set and night close in upon us.\r\n\r\nNext morning another large field of ice was discovered on our\r\nlarboard quarter, closing in upon us with considerable rapidity.  It\r\nextended along the offing for twelve or fourteen miles, and increased\r\nto the eye as it was borne towards us by an under-current.\r\n\r\nHartly conjectured it had drifted down Hudson's Strait from the Bay,\r\nand to avoid being _beset_ like the unfortunate craft we had been\r\nobserving, he brought off the ice-anchor and made sail on the brig,\r\nsteering due west and keeping her close hauled with his starboard\r\ntacks on board; but the field of ice we endeavoured to leave kept\r\nclose alongside, as if it sailed or floated _with_ us, which I have\r\nno doubt it did.\r\n\r\nThus both fields verged towards each other rapidly, one before the\r\nwind, the other before a current; and so, ere sunset, we were closely\r\nwedged in a frozen sea--BESET, amid a wilderness of pack-ice, of\r\nbergs, and hummocks, which extended, as far as the eye could discern\r\nfrom the main-crosstrees, in every direction, and probably far beyond\r\nthe horizon.\r\n\r\nThough this predicament was not without great peril, still it was\r\npreferable by many degrees to our last situation; for here we could\r\npursue the object of our expedition, and hoped to have our cargo\r\ncomplete, the hatches battened down, and all ready for our return to\r\nNewfoundland when the ice broke up, amid the warmer water of more\r\nsouthern latitudes, towards which we expected the field, like others,\r\nwould be borne by the currents.\r\n\r\nAlas! how little did we then foresee how long we and our desolate\r\nneighbour, whose disordered aspect and bare spars made her resemble a\r\nwithered bush or bunch of reeds at the horizon, were to remain in\r\nsight of each other.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI.\r\n\r\nBESET WITHOUT HOPE.\r\n\r\nI cared little about the slaughter of the seals,--indeed, I rather\r\ndisliked it--and for several days my attention was excited solely by\r\nthe vessel which was beset so far from us.\r\n\r\nMy imagination drew many painful scenes.  I endeavoured to picture\r\nhow long she had been there--weeks, months, it might be years!\r\n\r\nWhere was she from?  What had she been--a ship, brig, or schooner?\r\nfor by the confusion of her rigging, and the distance at which she\r\nlay from us, there was a difficulty in discovering this, even by by\r\nour most powerful glasses, or whether the smoke ever rose from her\r\ngalley funnel.\r\n\r\nHow many of her crew were alive, or had she a crew at all?  If so,\r\nwhat were their sufferings--if abandoned, amid that world of ice,\r\nwhither had they gone, and where had their perilous journey ended?\r\nOn Greenland, on the Labrador, or in the grave?\r\n\r\nThese queries were for ever recurring to me, and that old beset\r\nship--I had made up my mind that she _was_ old--was the first object\r\nto which my eyes turned when coming on deck in the morning, and the\r\nlast at night.  Fogs--the dense fogs of the Arctic seas--came on and\r\nshrouded us for days, till one's lungs almost filled with icy vapour,\r\nand the pulses of the heart seemed to freeze.  The wind blew a gale\r\nat times, but the ice remained fast as adamant around us; but when\r\nthe obscurity passed away, there lay the beset ship in the dim\r\ndistance, wearing the same lifeless aspect as ever, so dreary and\r\nforlorn amid that waste of cold white glistening ice, with its\r\nendless vistas of hummocks and splintered bergs.\r\n\r\nWe became somewhat alarmed on discovering by observations that\r\ninstead of drifting into southern latitudes, where the ice-fields are\r\nusually broken into floes, and a ship becomes free to shape her\r\ncourse in any direction, we were being borne almost due west, and\r\nwith considerable rapidity.  By this the temperature remained nearly\r\nthe same, and our besetting, like that of our unfortunate neighbour,\r\nbecame a permanence, and would probably continue so, unless we\r\nweathered Cape Farewell, of which Hartly had some doubts at that\r\nseason.\r\n\r\nWe had now reached the first week of April, and could only look\r\nforward to the early days of May, when the field-ice breaks up, and\r\nfrom the unknown seas and inlets of the north, floats southward in\r\nmasses so mighty, that a girdle of ice, sometimes two hundred miles\r\nin breadth, environs the coasts of Newfoundland and the Labrador.\r\n\r\nEre long we became sensible of a tremendous pressure upon the sides\r\nof the brig, a pressure so great that her timbers in some places\r\nbecame distorted, and Hartly was seriously alarmed lest she might be\r\ncrushed and destroyed.\r\n\r\nThis unwonted pressure rendered us very anxious, and inspired many\r\nwith dread.\r\n\r\nOne night when it was greater than usual, I was on deck, and from\r\nthence ascended into the main-rigging a little way to contemplate the\r\nsnow-covered scene--so vast, so silent, and so terrible in its beauty!\r\n\r\nSpreading far as the eye could reach--far beyond the old deserted\r\nship, for such we deemed her now--lay the hummocks in uncounted\r\nmyriads, ascending here and there into bergs and mountains, so\r\nimpressive in their cold purity, so solemnizing in their silence and\r\nmonotony, their spiral peaks glistening and vitreous against the blue\r\nimmensity of the sky--an accumulation of ice and snow that would seem\r\nto have lasted since the will and hand of God had first separated the\r\nland from the water, and marked the limits of both.\r\n\r\nWhile lost in reverie, and surveying this scene, a strange sound,\r\nlike that which might be caused by the rending of a vast rock\r\nasunder, fell upon my ear; then there was a shock which made every\r\nfibre in my body tingle.  A mighty power below us seemed to be\r\nhoisting the brig out of the ice, while her masts and hull began to\r\nsway to and fro.\r\n\r\n\"Aloft, lads--all hands aloft!\" cried Hartly; \"we are about to be\r\ncrushed--God help us! for all is over with us now!\"\r\n\r\nAll our men rushed into the rigging on hearing this terrible\r\nannouncement, and at the same moment there was another crashing\r\nshock, and lo! about a league from us, there ascended slowly and\r\nvertically into the air, a sheet or wall of ice, perhaps twenty feet\r\nthick, nearly a hundred feet in height, and several miles in length!\r\n\r\nErect it stood for some moments, like a giant rampart, and then broke\r\ninto fragments, and as the field collapsed below, these fell with a\r\nroar as if heaven and earth were coming together.\r\n\r\nHow many _millions of tons_ might have been in that erected mass no\r\nman could conceive, but the thunder of their fall, as they crashed\r\nand glittered in the moonlight, caused one's soul to shrink with awe\r\nand wonder at the grandeur and sublimity of such a scene.\r\n\r\nThe ice around us cracked and rent in every direction, but though\r\nthere was a vibration, a seeming heaving of the icebound sea, the\r\nbrig settled down again into her bed, and we were only relieved of\r\nthat intense pressure which had threatened us with immediate\r\ndestruction.\r\n\r\n\"We are saved--for this time,\" said Hartly.\r\n\r\n\"Have the currents caused this?\" I inquired.\r\n\r\n\"Partly: and the east edge of the ice-field has crashed upon a\r\nwestern shore.\"\r\n\r\n\"Greenland?\" suggested Paul Reeves.\r\n\r\n\"Of course.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then we are to the _north_ of Cape Farewell!\"\r\n\r\nI gazed wistfully towards the east.  Hartly saw the glance, and\r\nsmiled.\r\n\r\n\"You wish to snuff the land,\" said he; \"but whether the land on which\r\nthis mass of ice that imprisons us and our neighbour--a floating mass\r\nperhaps as large as Ireland--be just below the horizon, or two\r\nhundred miles distant, I have no means of ascertaining until I make a\r\ncorrect observation at noon.\"\r\n\r\nThe morrow came duly, and at twelve o'clock, Hartly, on consulting\r\nthe sun and his chart, declared that we were at least one hundred and\r\nseventy miles due westward of Cape Farewell, on the coast of\r\nGreenland.  We had thus drifted before the wind many hundred miles\r\nwith the ice.  The cold had now rendered the action of our compasses\r\nsluggish; but, situated as we were, that was of little consequence.\r\n\r\nOur anxiety increased as our provisions diminished; we were placed\r\nupon a scanty allowance; symptoms of scurvy became visible among our\r\nseal-fishers; and how shall I find words to describe the intensity of\r\nthe cold?\r\n\r\nAs we huddled together in the cabin at night, the ice actually came\r\ndown the funnel of the stove, and formed a little arch above the\r\nfire.  Our breath froze on our beards and whiskers, and on the\r\nblankets of our beds.  The barrels of salted junk had to be dashed to\r\npieces ere the food could be separated from the brine and staves.\r\nStiff grog froze as hard as our beer; and every day a smoky haze rose\r\nfrom the sea, and freezing as it rose, when blown about by the wind,\r\nseemed to scrape the very skin off one's face.  This frost-rime\r\nfrequently enveloped us like a dense fog for days, and when it\r\ncleared, the wearied eye had no object to rest on but the everlasting\r\nice and the old ship in the dreary distance.\r\n\r\nChancing to stumble one day against the anchor, my bare hand touched\r\nthe fluke, and a portion of skin adhered to it as if it had been hot\r\niron.\r\n\r\nWe hunted diligently for seals, as they formed our staple food, when\r\ncooked on a fire of blazing blubber.  The flesh of the cub,\r\nespecially the heart and liver, when hashed, and well seasoned with\r\npepper, was not unacceptable to appetites sharpened by the northern\r\nblast that came from the Arctic circle.\r\n\r\nThe middle of April came and passed away without a change, save that\r\nthe sun shone with a brilliance which somewhat alleviated the cold.\r\nOne day, at noon, I saw Hartly form a piece of pure fresh-water ice\r\nfrom the scuttle-bucket into a lens, through which he concentrated\r\nthe rays of the sun as through a burning-glass, and thus igniting\r\nlittle puffs of powder on the capstan-head, to the great astonishment\r\nof our seamen, and the terror of Cuffy, who began to consider him a\r\nspecies of Obi man.\r\n\r\nSo day followed day of captivity!\r\n\r\nSeal-hunting and idling over, we would assemble, and sit for hour\r\nafter hour, crouching close together for warmth, around our little\r\nfire, watching the glowing embers and the upward sparks; often in\r\ndreamy silence, mentally wondering where, when, and _how_ this\r\nmonotony, misery, and suffering were to end!\r\n\r\nAt times each almost fancied himself the last man in the world--and\r\ncertainly we were the last men to be envied.  Then terrible\r\nsensations crept over us, and horror filled our souls--the horror of\r\nbeing the _last survivor_, when famine and death came together among\r\nus.\r\n\r\nAs a relief from this intolerable monotony, a party of us resolved to\r\nvisit the other ship.  All were anxious to go; but Hartly said we\r\ncould never know the moment when the ice would partially break up;\r\nthus half the crew at least must remain with him for the safety of\r\nthe whole.\r\n\r\nFurnished with a sledge, on which we placed a supply of such\r\nprovisions as the _Leda_ could afford, a small breaker, or gang-cask\r\nof stiff grog, hatchets, guns, a compass, plenty of blankets, and\r\ntobacco, so as to be ready for any emergency or detention, twelve\r\nmen--Paul Reeves, Hans Peterkin, Tom Hammer, Cuffy, and myself\r\ninclusive--departed one bright morning about an hour after dawn,\r\nresolved to overhaul the stranger, and if we found her deserted, to\r\ncut away her masts, and drag them to the brig for fuel, though she\r\nlay now at least fifteen miles distant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII.\r\n\r\nTHE DEATH-SHIP.\r\n\r\nInured though we were to the cold, we felt the toil and peril very\r\ngreat when traversing the ice for fifteen miles; but fortunately the\r\nday was clear, and not a speck of cloud appeared upon the blue\r\nimmensity of the sky.\r\n\r\nThe crew of the _Leda_ cheered us from time to time until we were at\r\nsome distance, when they hoisted a red flag at the mainmast-head; but\r\nin the hollows between the hummocks and vast blocks of ice which were\r\njammed and piled upon each other by the recent concussion and\r\ncompression of the field, we lost sight of both ships at times, and\r\ncould only discover them while surmounting some of the frozen ridges.\r\n\r\nWe toiled bravely, anxious to attain the object of our journey ere\r\nnight came on, as we were assured of quarter on board, whatever might\r\nbe the circumstances of this strange-looking craft, the attention of\r\nwhose crew our colours by day, and our lanterns by night, had totally\r\nfailed to attract.\r\n\r\nFifteen miles over an ice-field--especially such an ice-field as that\r\nwhich inclosed us, rent by chasms in some places, and piled in giant\r\nblocks elsewhere--were equal to the toil of traversing forty miles on\r\nland; thus about two P.M., we found ourselves only eight miles from\r\nthe _Leda_, but rapidly gaining on the hull of the strange craft,\r\nwhich seemed to rise out of the ice as we approached, and the aspect\r\nof which puzzled us more than ever.  We halted for a brief space;\r\nthen each man partook of a biscuit and piece of seal's flesh boiled,\r\na ration of rum, and in ten minutes more we pushed on again, four\r\ndragging our sledge, laden with stores, by shoulder-belts made for\r\nthe purpose, and relieved by other four at every two miles or so.\r\n\r\nOur expedition was not without several dangers.  Fog might come on\r\nand conceal both ships from us; a blinding storm of snow might have\r\nthe same effect, and pile its drifts above our corpses for ever.  The\r\nice-field might break up, and separate us from our ship so long that\r\nwhen our slender stock of necessaries was expended, we should\r\ninfallibly perish.  Each man among us thought of these possible and\r\nterrible contingencies as the distance increased between us and the\r\n_Leda_--our home amid the icy waste--but none spoke of them _then_;\r\nall sang cheerily, and pushed on to overhaul the strange craft; thus\r\nabout five in the afternoon we found ourselves alongside, and all\r\npaused to survey her with deep and undefinable emotions of awe in our\r\nbreasts, for she had evidently been long deserted, and now wore a\r\nmost chilling and desolate aspect.\r\n\r\nShe was an old-fashioned pink-built barque, of about six hundred\r\ntons, with bulging ribs and bluff bows; broad and clumsy in the\r\ncounter and deep in the bends--all fenced about with iron bands; she\r\nlooked like a whaler of George the Second's time, for, with a fiddle\r\nhead, she had the remains of a jack-staff and spritsail yard upon her\r\nbowsprit.  Her hull and spars were thickly coated with ice.\r\n\r\nHer fore and main topmasts were gone; her mizen was broken off at the\r\ncrosstrees, and hung, truck downward, in its gear.\r\n\r\nThe topping-lifts and braces of the yards had long since given way,\r\nand tatters of them swung mournfully on the wind.  Many of the yards\r\nhad dropped from their slings, and lay athwart the deck or among the\r\nice alongside, where the gales had tossed them.\r\n\r\nHer ironwork was red and corroded; almost every vestige of paint and\r\ntar had long since disappeared, as if she had been scraped by the\r\nice; beaten, battered, and washed by Arctic storms, American fogs,\r\nand Greenland showers of sleet and rain, for many, many years must\r\nhave elapsed since the keel of this old craft had last been in blue\r\nwater, and first been frozen in the treacherous ice; years of\r\ndrifting to and fro in the far and frozen regions of the north, where\r\nperchance not even the eye of the Esquimaux had seen her.\r\n\r\nWe seemed all to read and know her history instinctively at a glance;\r\nbut her crew--what had their fate been?\r\n\r\nInspired by a strange emotion, we hung back, while gazing at her, as\r\nshe stood like a silent ruin, or the ghost of a ship in the frosty\r\nsunshine of the April evening; but no man attempted to board her,\r\ntill Paul Reeves, taking a hatchet from the sledge, exclaimed,\r\n\r\n\"Come on, shipmates--we'll overhaul her!\" and proceeded at once to\r\nmount from the ice into her mainchains.  As he grasped the starboard\r\nshrouds about the upper dead-eyes, the whole gave way from their\r\nrotten cat-harpings and crashed about him, with a shower of the ice\r\nthat had coated them for years.\r\n\r\n\"By Jove! lads, 'twas not yesterday this craft left the rigger's\r\nhands!\" said he, as we clambered after him, and at length stood upon\r\nher deck, which was coated about two feet deep with hard frozen snow,\r\non the pure whiteness of which no foot-track was visible.\r\n\r\nSailors are ever superstitious; but theirs is an honest and\r\nreverential superstition, very different from that of the landsman;\r\nthus in breathless silence our party paused upon her deck, as if it\r\nhad been the lid of a huge coffin.\r\n\r\n\"Go on--go on!\" said several; yet no man moved, for there was a\r\ndeathlike silence in and around her.\r\n\r\nHer main-hatch was battened down; but we could see that the companion\r\naft and the fore-hatch were partly open.  Her long-boat was turned\r\nkeel upmost on deck, aft the foremast; and by other indications it\r\nhad doubtless formed a species of round-house.  Various large white\r\nbones, fragments of broken casks, coils of old bleached ropes, and\r\nrusty harpoons were strewn about, and served to indicate that she had\r\nbeen a whale-ship.\r\n\r\nUrged by curiosity, I proceeded towards her cabin, my eleven\r\nshipmates following closely at my heels.\r\n\r\nThe skylight was covered with snow; yet through a broken pane I could\r\nperceive the figures of men below: then I turned to descend into her\r\ndark, gloomy, and slimy cabin, on entering which I beheld a wondrous\r\nscene of horror, such as can never be forgotten by me, nor was it by\r\nthose who accompanied me.\r\n\r\nThe red glow of the sun, now setting beyond the distant waste of ice,\r\nshone from the west through her two square stern windows, pouring\r\nathwart her cabin a sombre and dusky light.  Its sides were covered\r\nby a damp mould, which was green and thick as moss.  Nearly three\r\nfeet of snow, which had drifted down the companion-hatch, was lying\r\nupon its floor; half buried among it and huddled close together in a\r\ncorner, lay the bodies of three emaciated men, with fur caps tied\r\nunder their wasted jaws.\r\n\r\nA blue and ghastly hand that hung over one of the cabin berths\r\nannounced that a dead man lay there; and seated at the table was\r\nanother, whose arms, head, and back were half covered by the snow,\r\nthat had drifted over him after he had sunk into the sleep of death.\r\nHis coat was old in fashion, with large brass buttons and square\r\npocket-flaps.  Amid the snow that covered the table, and amid which\r\nhis face was hidden, there appeared the necks of one or two square\r\ncase-bottles--empty.\r\n\r\nA quill was also standing amid the snow, and seemed to indicate that\r\nthe dead man had been writing, for it was still in the pewter\r\ninkhorn, and near it stood a lamp, used by him probably to keep his\r\nink from freezing.  Close by appeared the corner of a book, which I\r\ndrew with difficulty from amid the frozen snow, and then impelled by\r\na horror, of that cold dark floating grave, like frightened\r\nschoolboys we rushed up the cabin-stairs, and regained the deck, just\r\nas the last segment of the sun's red disc went down beyond the frozen\r\nsea.\r\n\r\nWe stood in a group near the mouldering mainmast, gazing at each\r\nother awe-struck, for we had looked on the faces of men who had been\r\ndead for years--how many, we knew not.\r\n\r\n\"There is _something moving_ in the forehold!\" exclaimed Tom Hammer,\r\nthe carpenter, while his teeth chattered alike with cold and fear.\r\n\r\n\"Something?\" I reiterated.\r\n\r\n\"Ay, sir, and alive, too!  Do you hear _that_?\" added old Hans\r\nPeterkin, in terror.\r\n\r\nIt was a strange, croaking sound; and then, as we approached the\r\nhalf-open hatch of the forehold, we heard the flapping of large wings.\r\n\r\nThough almost paralysed by hearing such an unwonted sound in such a\r\nplace, one of our seal-fishers fired his gun in his confusion.  I\r\ncrept forward and peeped fearfully down, but could not distinguish\r\nanything amid the gloom below.\r\n\r\nThen we heard another croak, which sounded so loud and so dreadful to\r\nour over-strained organs of hearing that it nearly made us all\r\nscamper over the side; when suddenly two giant ravens, who had\r\ndoubtless long made the empty wreck their home, rose through the\r\nfore-hatchway on their black booming pinions, and soaring high into\r\nthe clear air, winged their way directly to the east, and so swiftly\r\nthat they soon disappeared.\r\n\r\n\"The land lies where they are flying to,\" said Reeves.\r\n\r\n\"And it is not far off, as their presence here would indicate,\" added\r\na seaman.\r\n\r\nThis idea encouraged us all very much, as we forgot that they might\r\nhave floated with the ice-field for years.  We were about to descend\r\ninto the forehold, but on lifting the other half of the decayed\r\nhatch, we found the frozen remains of a man hanging there by the\r\nneck, and half devoured by those obscene birds.  A capstan-bar had\r\nbeen placed athwart the combing, and to this he had suspended himself\r\nby a well-greased rope.\r\n\r\nWas this unfortunate the last survivor, who, in desperation, had thus\r\nawfully ended his misery?\r\n\r\nHis situation seemed to say so.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII.\r\n\r\nLEAVES FROM THE LOG.\r\n\r\nWe repaired to our sledge alongside, and dragging it a little way\r\nfrom the deserted barque, took a ration of grog (of which we stood\r\nmuch in need), and then I proceeded to examine the volume we had\r\nbrought away.  It proved to be the mouldered fragments of a log-book\r\nor diary kept by the mate--doubtless the dead man, who was seated on\r\nthe stern locker, and whose body was reclining on the snow-covered\r\ncabin table.\r\n\r\nFrom this book we could glean that she was the _Royal Bounty_, a\r\nPeterhead whaler, which had been beset in the ice off Cape Desolation\r\nin 1801, and that one by one all her crew had perished of cold,\r\nhunger, and despair!\r\n\r\nThe thick and crystalline coat of ice which covered every portion of\r\nthe ship, from her tops to her chain-plates--a coat that had never\r\nmelted or been disturbed--had protected her rigging, spars, and hull\r\nfrom the natural progress of decay; so let none suppose it marvellous\r\nthat in a region or atmosphere of eternal snow, bodies are also thus\r\npreserved; for frequently the remains of elephants and mammoths which\r\nlived before the flood, and of pre-Adamite monsters, are found buried\r\nin the Arctic ice, unchanged, undecayed, and entire.\r\n\r\nAt the mouth of the Lena, in Siberia--a river which traverses the\r\nvast and uninhabited plains of Asiatic Russia--there was discovered,\r\nin 1805, a mammoth entire, with the hair on its skin four inches\r\nlong, and all of a reddish-black; and so frequently are similar\r\ndiscoveries made along the shores of the Frozen Sea, that the poor\r\nRussians believe that race of animals to be still extant in their\r\ncountry, but existing like moles which dwell underground, and cannot\r\nendure the light of day; and their exhumation from the ice is ever\r\ndeemed a forerunner of calamity, as it is said that all who see them\r\ndie soon after.  But to resume.\r\n\r\nThe book was much mouldered and decayed; only a few entries here and\r\nthere could be traced, as its leaves, now soft and pulpy, perished in\r\nour fingers when we attempted to turn them over.  A few passages ran\r\nthus:--\r\n\r\n\"March 3rd, 1801; a brisk breeze from the S.W.

These memoranda were in the handwriting of various persons,\r\nand were frequently mingled with earnest prayers for release.  Then\r\nscurvy appears to have broken out among them, and disease was quickly\r\nfollowed by death.\r\n\r\n\"1802.  Birnie from Buchan-ness, off duty, unwell--Birnie's teeth\r\nfell out of his head.

God rest them!\r\n\r\n\"May 6th.  Jobson ill with scurvy and blindness--Cairns died, and was\r\nburied beside Birnie .........\"\r\n\r\nMany leaves totally illegible followed, till we deciphered a passage\r\nlike this--\r\n\r\n\"1802, 4th Dec.  The captain died in his berth this day at 8 A.M.,\r\nand we are too weak to move him.  Smith, Arthur, and the cook are\r\ndead, or dying of hunger on the cabin floor!  We have now been beset\r\ntwo years and twenty-one days.  In that time twenty-four men have\r\ndied out of a crew of nine-and-twenty--no hope! no mercy!  My God!\r\nwhere is all this to end?  We sailed upon a Friday, and this ........\"\r\n\r\nI shut the book abruptly, for I could perceive in the twilight a\r\nblank horror stealing over the pale features of my companions as we\r\nstood beside that old vessel--a frozen tomb; and favoured by the\r\nlight of the rising moon, we proceeded to regain the _Leda_, with all\r\nthe speed we could exert; for to some it appeared as if our future\r\nfate was fearfully foreshadowed in the story of this old doomed\r\nwhale-ship.  Half a mile distant, on her starboard bow, an ice-coated\r\npole was visible.  It seemed to indicate where her dead were buried.\r\n\r\nHans Peterkin and three others strapped the collar-ropes over their\r\nshoulders for the first \"spell,\" and proceeded briskly in front with\r\nour sledge of blankets, &c.  The rest followed in silence, and only\r\nturned from time to time to cast a backward glance at the old whaler,\r\nwhose decaying spars, coated with ice, glimmered darkly against the\r\nstarry sky.  The moon arose in her full northern splendour--clear,\r\nglorious, and wondrous!  The sharp summits of the bergs (the\r\nice-mountains that rose from the plains of ice) gleamed and glittered\r\nlike mighty prisms, or spires, pyramids, and obelisks of crystal and\r\nspar.\r\n\r\nAfter all we had seen, the dead, the awful stillness of the frozen\r\nsea--that snow-clad plain, \"the silence of which seemed to come from\r\nafar and to go afar,\" impressed us with deep and solemn emotions.\r\nThus, for several miles we trod gloomily on, equally desirous of\r\nreaching the _Leda_ and of leaving far behind the scene of gloom I\r\nhave described.\r\n\r\nThe spirits of our party were sorely depressed; but Paul Reeves and I\r\ndid everything in our power, by cheerfulness and anecdotes, to divert\r\nthe gloomy current of their ideas; though poor Paul was not without\r\nfears that a day might come when he would be inserting in the log of\r\nthe _Leda_, entries similar to those I have quoted from the\r\nmouldering volume we had brought away.\r\n\r\n\"We have found a ship of the dead,\" said he, \"but that is nothing!\r\nWhat think you, shipmates, of a whole city full?\"\r\n\r\n\"A city full!\" reiterated our men.\r\n\r\n\"Not exactly a city like London--but a city, nevertheless.\"\r\n\r\n\"And where was this?\" asked Hans, doubtfully.\r\n\r\n\"I read of it in a book--a real printed book--when I was in South\r\nCarolina.  There was one Lionel Wafer, an English surgeon, who,\r\nhaving nobody to physic at home, took a voyage with the old\r\nbuccaneers to the South Seas.  Well, on one occasion, his craft was\r\ncruising off Vermijo, at the mouth of the Red River, in Peru.  It was\r\na wild and solitary place; but he went ashore with a boat's crew, and\r\ntravelled four miles up the stream in quest of adventures; and there,\r\nfrom the margin of a fine sandy bay, a plain spread inland as wide as\r\nthis ice-field, all covered with the ruins of streets, built of\r\nmighty blocks of stone carved with wonderful sculptures, like those\r\nof the Egyptians--only more terrible and quaint; and among these\r\ncrumbling streets and mansions were thousands of graves half open,\r\nwith the dead bodies of men, women, and little children in them, all\r\nmummified and light as cork, for they had been dead two hundred years\r\nor more.\r\n\r\n\"His men were terrified, and fled back to their boat; but on the way\r\nthey met an old Indian, who related that, in the days of his\r\nforefathers, this arid plain had once been fruitful and green as the\r\ngreenest savannah, and the country so populous, that a fish of the\r\nRed River could have been passed through the land from hand to hand,\r\ntill it was laid at the foot of the throne of the Inca (that was\r\ntheir king, shipmates); but the cruel, murdering Spaniards came, with\r\ntheir guns and bloodhounds, and laid siege to the capital city.  Its\r\ndefence was long and desperate; and rather than yield, the\r\ninhabitants slew themselves, and buried each other in the sand, till\r\nthere was only one man left, and _he_ drowned himself in the Red\r\nRiver.\r\n\r\n\"In after years the stormy winds had blown the dry sand aside, and\r\nthere the grim Mexicans lay in thousands--the women with the pearls\r\nof Vermijo at their ears and round their necks, their little\r\nchildren, their distaffs and hand-mills by their sides, and their\r\nlong black hair filled with coins and precious stones.  There, too,\r\nlay the warriors, with their flint axes and broken spears, and the\r\nwar-paint yet traceable on their mummies.  Lionel Wafer brought away\r\nthe body of a child, but the buccaneers would not admit it on board\r\nlest it might bring a plague or a curse upon them; so he threw it\r\ninto the Rio Grande.\"\r\n\r\nThis yarn produced others equally lively, of course; but while\r\nconversing we got over the dreary waste of hummocks more rapidly, and\r\nsome time after midnight were welcomed on board the _Leda_, where\r\nthose whom we had left were burning with curiosity to learn the\r\nresult of our expedition.\r\n\r\nThe impression of all we had seen was so vivid, that a horror lest\r\nthe same fate should befal us, made our men suggest and revolve every\r\nrash plan for release.\r\n\r\nThe flight of the two ravens eastward indicated that land could not\r\nbe far off.  Hans Peterkin, a hardy Orcadian, who was suffering from\r\nscurvy, proposed that if matters grew more desperate, we should\r\ntravel over the field, taking with us the longboat upon\r\nsledge-runners.  Some urged that we should bore through the ice with\r\ncanvas set, while gangs went ahead blasting it up with gunpowder.\r\n\r\n\"Bore and blast through ice twenty feet thick, for a hundred miles,\r\nperhaps!\" said Hartly, with sorrowful irony.\r\n\r\nBut scurvy continued to increase among us; and on the eighth day\r\nafter our visit to the ship one of our crew died, and was buried in\r\nthe ice; while the brig was thrown in mourning, her colours\r\nhalf-mast, her running-gear cast in loose bights, and her yards\r\ntopped up variously.\r\n\r\nAfter his funeral, which had a most depressing effect upon us all, I\r\nremarked to Hartly, that either by a strange coincidence or by an\r\nirresistible fatality, we had interred him _half a mile distant on\r\nthe starboard bow_, exactly as the crew of the old whaler had\r\ninterred _their dead_!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX.\r\n\r\nTHE GRAVES ON THE STARBOARD BOW.\r\n\r\nThe last of our stone ballast had long since been thrown overboard on\r\nthe ice, and was replaced by seal skins.  We had now a valuable\r\ncargo, over which the hatches were barred and battened; but Hartly's\r\nhopes for an honest profit on his adventurous expedition were\r\nforgotten, or merged in the overwhelming desire for freedom and the\r\nsafety of our lives and of the brig.\r\n\r\nAlready five deaths were recorded in her log; and Hartly vowed that\r\nif ever again her bows cut blue water, he would never more tempt Dame\r\nFortune in _the region of ice_.\r\n\r\nBy this time our monotonous detention had so far exceeded every\r\nexpectation and contingency; that our beer, rum, and other spirits,\r\nour salted beef, preserved meats, and lime-juice were consumed; and\r\nthough our biscuits were doled out in very small rations indeed, grim\r\nstarvation was before us, or food composed of seal and blubber alone;\r\nso scurvy in its worst forms assailed us all more or less.  Our\r\nstrongest seamen were the first who sank under it: their complexions\r\nbecame yellow, with swollen gums, loosened teeth, and fetid breath.\r\nThese symptoms were accompanied by a difficulty in respiring, which,\r\non the least exertion being made, amounted almost to suffocation.\r\n\r\nTwo of our gunners died one evening within an hour of each other.  We\r\nwrapped them in blankets, and buried them quickly, under cloud of\r\nnight, lest the survivors might be affected by the scene.\r\n\r\nHartly, Hans Peterkin, Cuffy, and I performed this melancholy office,\r\nwhen we had no lamp but the twinkling stars and the sharp streamers\r\nof the northern lights, shooting upward from the icebergs that edged\r\nthe plain, over which the wind blew keen and bitingly.\r\n\r\nGrim seemed the pale faces of the dead in that wavering gloom, as we\r\nlowered them into their last home, heaped the ice above them, and\r\nreturned to the _Leda_, leaving them to sleep the sleep of death\r\namong their shipmates _half a mile distant on her starboard bow_.\r\n\r\nAnd now with each day there sank a deeper horror over us--the horror\r\nthat, like the old whaler at the horizon, the _Leda_ was a ship\r\nforedoomed!  Yet, like her, we had _not_ sailed upon a Friday.\r\n\r\nWe were without a surgeon; but Hartly was a skilful fellow, and by\r\nadministering such simples as we possessed, he endeavoured to\r\nameliorate the condition of his suffering crew.\r\n\r\nCommon potatoes he washed, cut into thin slices, and gave raw to\r\nsome, for the cure of their swollen and bleeding gums--usually a\r\nsovereign remedy in this case.  To others he gave decoctions of\r\ntamarinds, scraped from an old gallipot, and boiled with cream of\r\ntartar; or a ship biscuit pounded into a panada, and sweetened with\r\nsugar; or gargles made of honey of roses and elixir of vitriol; but,\r\nere long, even these remedies failed us; and we had Reeves, Hans\r\nPeterkin, and more than half our remaining crew, unable to raise\r\ntheir heads or hands, sick and despairing.\r\n\r\nThe miserable Esquimaux, by scraping the snow from their native\r\nrocks, can find coarse berries, sorrel, and cresses, with which to\r\ncorrect their blubber food; but in that world of ice we had no such\r\nboon accorded us.\r\n\r\nArmed with our rifles and knives, I set forth with two of our\r\nhealthiest men, Dick and James Abbot, two brothers, in search of a\r\nfew fresh seals, as they had learned to shun our locality, and had\r\nceased to venture through their holes in the ice for some time past.\r\n\r\nWe left the brig about two o'clock, P.M.\r\n\r\nOn this day the wind was blowing hard, the white scud was flying fast\r\nthrough the blue sky, and for the first time we felt a heaving motion\r\nin the ice, which warned us instinctively not to venture far from the\r\n_Leda_.  After a ramble of three hours, we had only shot one seal and\r\nknocked two cubs on the head with our rifle-butts, when we sat down\r\non a hummock to rest, at the distance of two miles or so from our\r\nice-bound home.\r\n\r\n\"I wonder much how the masts of that old craft the _Bounty_ have\r\nstood these many years?\" said Dick Abbot, breaking a long silence.\r\n\r\n\"The coating of ice has saved them, as it has preserved everything on\r\nboard--from decay, at least,\" replied his brother.\r\n\r\n\"Always thinking of that ship,\" said I, with an air of annoyance.\r\n\"Come, let us talk of something more cheerful.  You know that\r\nshe--but _where is she_?\" I added, as we swept the horizon in vain\r\nfor her--the sole object on which our eyes had rested for so many\r\ndreary weeks.\r\n\r\n\"Sunk, by Jove! or can her old spars have gone by the board at last?\"\r\nexclaimed James Abbot, starting up.\r\n\r\nIn great excitement we clambered to the summit of a mass of ice, and\r\nlooked around us.  Not a vestige of the old barque could be seen, but\r\ndense clouds that came heavily up from the north were overspreading\r\nthe sky, against the blue of which her crystal-coated spars had so\r\nlong been visible.\r\n\r\n\"We shall have foul weather,\" said Dick Abbot.\r\n\r\n\"And so they seem to think, sir, aboard the brig,\" added his brother:\r\n\"see--they've run the ensign up to the gaff peak as a signal for us\r\nto return, Mr. Manly.\"\r\n\r\n\"But our three seals----\"\r\n\r\n\"We must leave them where they are--that big hummock will mark where\r\nthey lie till to-morrow.\"\r\n\r\n\"James is right, sir,\" said Dick Abbot; \"let us get back to the brig\r\nas fast as we can.\"\r\n\r\n\"She is two miles distant, at least,\" said I.\r\n\r\n\"The sky darkens fast; and see--see!\" he added, with wild joy\r\nexpressed in all his features, his eyes, and voice; \"the captain\r\nexpects something--they've cast loose the courses, and are hoisting\r\nthe topsailyards--THE ICE IS BREAKING UP!\"\r\n\r\nThese words made every pulse quicken, and as if in corroboration of\r\nhis surmise, we felt the field on which we trod agitated by\r\nconvulsive throes, and these increased as the fierce and darkening\r\nblast, armed with showers of hailstones large as peas, that fell\r\naslant the cold grey sky, deepened the atmosphere around us.  Madly\r\nwe toiled, scrambled, and rolled--fell, rose, and fell again--shouted\r\nand cheered to each other, as we surmounted the endless succession of\r\nglassy hummocks and snowy hollows to reach the _Leda_; but the gloom\r\nincreased so fast, that in less than half an hour we could no longer\r\ndistinguish where she lay.\r\n\r\nWe did not feel cold--our brains seemed on fire, our bloodshot eyes\r\nwere wild and eager in expression, as we toiled on and on--but\r\n_where_ was the brig?\r\n\r\nA misty veil of hail and snow--an atmosphere dark as the twilight of\r\nthe Scandinavian gods--enveloped us like a curtain.  We paused at\r\ntimes in our desperation, and uttered a simultaneous hallo; but no\r\nvoice replied, no sound responded, save the hiss of the hailstones as\r\nthey showered on the hard hummocks.  Then we heard from time to time\r\na stunning crash, as the field was rent asunder into floes, that were\r\nsurged and driven against each other with such force as the waves of\r\nan irresistible sea can alone exert.\r\n\r\nTo us this crisis was, as I have said, maddening.  We tossed away our\r\nrifles, shot-belts, knives, bats, and everything that might impede\r\nour progress, and toiled in wild despair in search of the _Leda_--but\r\nalas, alas! the _Leda_ was nowhere to be seen!\r\n\r\n\"Can we have passed her?\" we asked repeatedly.\r\n\r\nTo return was to acknowledge still more that we were at fault.\r\n\r\nLeft upon the breaking ice, with night deepening, and a tempest,\r\nperhaps, coming on together; the ice-field rending into floes, and\r\nthe _Leda_, when last seen, with her topsails loose for sea, and now\r\nwe knew not where, but assuredly not within call of our united\r\nvoices, which the envious wind, the very spirit of the wintry storm,\r\nswept from our trembling lips, as if in mockery of efforts and\r\nstruggles so feeble as those of man when contending with the warring\r\nelements of God,--how terrible was our situation!\r\n\r\nInspired either by the activity of youth, or a greater dread of\r\nperishing, I left my companions some twenty yards behind me.  In this\r\nrace for life and death poor Dick Abbot was failing, and his younger\r\nbrother was loth to leave him a single pace behind.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Manly,\" I heard him cry, \"take time, please; do you see anything\r\nyet, sir--of the brig, I mean?\" \"Not a vestige,\" said I, turning to\r\nwait until they joined me.\r\n\r\nThe ice was bursting in every direction, and the waves seemed to boil\r\nthrough the yawning rents in snowy foam; vast pieces, like bergs,\r\narose from the water, and were dashed against each other, to sink\r\ninto the deep, to arise, and then be dashed together again.  Add to\r\nthis the darkness of the gathering night, the roar of the biting\r\nwind, and the dense murkiness caused by the hail as it swept through\r\nthat mighty waste, and the reader may have an idea of the scene when\r\nI paused and looked back for my two companions.\r\n\r\nAt that moment the ice heaved beneath my feet, I was thrown forward\r\non my face and almost stunned.  There was a terrific splitting sound\r\nas the field around us broke into a thousand floes: I found myself\r\nseparated from my two friends, upon a piece of ice about half a mile\r\nsquare, and borne away with it, despairing and alone, into the mist\r\nand darkness of the stormy night.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX.\r\n\r\nADRIFT ON THE DEAD FLOE.\r\n\r\nAll was obscurity around me--a chaos of tumbling waves, of crashing\r\nice and hissing hail.\r\n\r\nI shouted wildly, fiercely, as the dying or despairing alone may\r\nshout.\r\n\r\nA faint response seemed to come through the drift and the hail that\r\nwas sowing the ice and pathless sea; but it might have been fancy, or\r\nmy own cry tossed back by the mocking wind.  And now from time to\r\ntime I was covered by the icy _spoondrift_, as the water which the\r\nwind sweeps from the wave-tops is named by seamen.\r\n\r\nFor a time I felt the impossibility of realizing the actual horrors\r\nof such a situation, and murmured repeatedly--\r\n\r\n\"Oh, this cannot be reality; if so, it must soon come to an end, and\r\nI shall be dead!\"\r\n\r\nThe floe on which I sat surged and rolled heavily, as it was rasped,\r\ndashed against others, and whirled round in the eddies they made.  On\r\nits slippery surface I was driven hither and thither, even when\r\nseated; and at last, on finding myself among some large stones which\r\nwere frozen into the snow, and which I knew to be a portion of the\r\nbrig's ballast, I shuddered with instinctive dread when discovering\r\nthat I was adrift on that portion of the ice in which our dead were\r\nburied, and which had lain on her starboard bow.  Thus I learned that\r\nat the moment of my separation from the Abbots, I had been within\r\nhalf a mile of the _Leda_.\r\n\r\nThere was agony in this now useless conviction!\r\n\r\n\"Am I to find a grave here, after all?\" was my thought.\r\n\r\nIf I could live till dawn, the crew of the _Leda_ (if she, too,\r\nsurvived the night) might see and save me; but who could live on an\r\nice-floe through so many freezing hours?\r\n\r\nAfter a time the wind lulled, the hail ceased, the clouds were\r\ndivided in heaven, and a star or two shone in its blue vault.  The\r\nice-blocks ceased to crash against the floe, thus its motion became\r\nsteadier, and under the lee of a hummock, I endeavoured to keep\r\nmyself as warm as my upper garments, which were entirely composed of\r\nseal-skins, would enable me.\r\n\r\nThe moon was rising, and its fitful light added to the chaotic\r\nterrors of the scene around me.  To be alone--_alone_ upon a floe at\r\nmidnight, with the open sea rolling around me!  All seemed over with\r\nme now.  I felt that my sufferings could not last long, as I should\r\ncertainly pass away in the heavy slumber of those who perish by\r\nexhaustion and intensity of cold.  In spite of this horrible thought,\r\nI gradually became torpid.\r\n\r\nI had been, perhaps, an hour in this situation, when I seemed\r\nsuddenly to start to life, as a bank of vapour close by parted like a\r\ncrape curtain, and the moonbeams fell upon the white canvas of a\r\nvessel.  She was a brig--she was the _Leda_, under weigh, and distant\r\nfrom the floe not more than one hundred yards!\r\n\r\nShe was under sail, with her foreyards aback to deaden her way, as\r\nshe was rasping along a lee of ice-floes and _brash_, as the smaller\r\nfragments are technically named.  The weather had now become so calm,\r\nthat her canvas, which glittered white as snow in the moonshine, was\r\nalmost, as the sailors say, _asleep_, there being just sufficient\r\nwind to keep it from waking.\r\n\r\nI endeavoured to shout, but my tongue was paralysed as if in a\r\nnightmare; sobs only came from my heart, and I thought all sense\r\nwould leave me, as the brig, like a spectre, came slowly gliding\r\npast.  Again and again I endeavoured to hail her, but in vain.\r\n\r\nI rushed to the edge of the floe, at the risk of slipping off it into\r\nthe sea.  Then a faint shout reached my ear, and made my heart throb\r\nwith joy.  Those on deck could not hear my voice, but they had seen\r\nmy figure in the moonlight; and in a few minutes I beheld a boat\r\nshoved off from her, and heard the cheerful voice of old Hans\r\nPeterkin, crying with his Orkney _patois_--\r\n\r\n\"Quick, my lads--lay out on your oars!\" as they pulled through the\r\nrack and drift towards me.\r\n\r\nI was soon dragged on board the boat, and on reaching the deck of the\r\n_Leda_, fainted, after all I had undergone, and the joy of escaping a\r\ndeath so terrible.  The last sounds I remember were the voice of\r\nHartly welcoming me, and the jarring of the yards and braces, as the\r\nforeyards were filled, and the brig payed off bravely before the\r\ngentle breeze.\r\n\r\nOf my unfortunate companions, no trace was ever seen!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI.\r\n\r\nCAPE FAREWELL.\r\n\r\nFor three days our course was encumbered by masses of broken ice,\r\nwhich seemed to crowd upon and follow us; thus the brig was\r\nconstantly being put about or thrown in the wind, backing and filling\r\nto avoid the large floes and calves, as those treacherous pieces of\r\nsunken or detached ice which suddenly rush to the surface are named.\r\nTo avoid the lesser floes, we had often to carry a warp to a large\r\none, and track along its side.  The cheerful voice of Hartly might\r\nalways be heard encouraging the faint and weary on these occasions.\r\n\r\n\"Now, my lads--tally on! bowse away upon the guess-warp!\"\r\n\r\n\"Hurrah!\" the men would answer, as they pulled together vigorously.\r\n\r\n\"Once more we are afloat, Jack,\" said he to me, on the third morning.\r\n\"I began to fear we should berth all our ship's company in the ice\r\nthat lay on the starboard bow; but now we may sit cosily in the\r\ncabin, as of yore, and learn how her head lies by the _tell-tale_\r\ncompass that swings in the skylight.\"\r\n\r\nAgain at sea, our sick recovered as if by a miracle; but still many\r\nantidotes against scurvy were requisite before we could haul up for\r\nthe long voyage that lay between us and St. John.  I caught a few\r\nfish, and they formed a delicious change for Cuffy's fricasees of\r\nodious blubber, served up half cold in a greasy mess-kid.\r\n\r\nOnce more there was a reckoning to keep.  For a few cloudy days we\r\nhad merely kept a dead one, by log and compass; but on making a solar\r\nobservation, Hartly and Reeves found that they were many hundred\r\nmiles eastward of where they expected to be; and this was a\r\ncircumstance over which they had no control.\r\n\r\nIt is well-known that a current which comes down Davis' Straits\r\neddies round the east coast of Greenland.  By this we had been borne\r\ntowards its western shore with great rapidity.\r\n\r\nIn 1818, the _Anne_, of Poole, when beset by an ice-field, was thus\r\ndrifted at the rate of two hundred and twenty miles per day!\r\n\r\nEarly on the morning of the fourth day, the sea was pretty clear of\r\nfloes; but a dense and dusky fog-bank came down like a curtain, and\r\nseemed to float upon the water, about twenty miles from us.  We had\r\nsuffered considerably in our besetting, and by concussions among the\r\nfloes; so, as the morning was calm and sunny, Hartly had all hands at\r\nwork, tarring, painting, and repairing our various damages.  A spare\r\njib-boom was shipped, and it was soon taut with its heel-rope and\r\njib-guys; our rudder was finally repaired, and two new staysails were\r\nbeing bent, when there was a cry of \"land\" from aloft.\r\n\r\n\"Land in sight!\" shouted Hans Peterkin, who was out on the arm of the\r\nfore-topgallant yard, repairing something.\r\n\r\n\"Lad!--where?\" asked Hartly, snatching his telescope from the\r\ncompanion.\r\n\r\n\"On the lee quarter, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"You must have deuced good eyes, Hans,\" said the captain, sweeping\r\nalong the fog-bank with his glass; \"for nothing like land can I see!\"\r\n\r\n\"The bank is rising, sir,\" replied the Orcadian, as he sat jauntily\r\nastride his lofty perch, and pointed to the east.  \"I see either an\r\nisland or headland.\"\r\n\r\nEven while he spoke, the dense mountain of vapour, behind which the\r\nmorning sun was shining, rose slowly from the surface of the sea, and\r\nwith the naked eye we could see, at the far horizon, a low dark\r\nstreak, that ended in a bluff or promontory Hartly sharply closed his\r\ntelescope.\r\n\r\n\"Luff, Paul--keep your luff,\" said he; \"lie closer to the wind, while\r\nI prick off our place on the chart.\"  He hurried below; but soon\r\nreturned, saying, \"That is either Cape Farewell, or I am bewitched.\"\r\n\r\n\"Off the coast of Greenland?\" said I.\r\n\r\n\"No, _on_ the coast of Greenland,\" he replied, laughing.  \"And now,\r\nas the ice and current have driven us so near it in spite of our\r\nteeth, we may as well stand in for the shore, and get some fresh\r\nprovisions, before bearing up for Newfoundland.\"\r\n\r\nA careful examination of the chart proved that we had drifted, or\r\nbeen driven (in our endeavours to avoid the floes) to latitude 59°\r\n48' North, and were in longitude 43° 54' West of Greenwich,\r\nconsequently, the land we saw was undoubtedly Cape Farewell, a lofty\r\npromontory which forms the most southern extremity of Greenland.\r\n\r\nWith considerable satisfaction we stood in towards the shore, in the\r\nhope of obtaining supplies from some of the Moravian settlements.\r\n\r\nAbout four hours after, some of the natives who were fishing came\r\nabout us in their strange boats, which are made of whalebone covered\r\nwith seal-skin, and shaped like a weaver's shuttle, so that they may\r\nbe rowed any way.\r\n\r\nBy sunset we were close upon the land, and came to anchor several\r\nmiles north of the cape in a little cove of Nennortalik, or the Isle\r\nof Bears, where, as Reeves said jestingly, we had no _groundage_ to\r\npay for letting go our cable; and there the wondering population of\r\nthe little Moravian colony received us with acclamation.  The canvas\r\nwas handed and most of the crew were allowed to go on shore, with\r\ninstructions to return with as much scurvy-grass as they could\r\ncollect; for with this herb, like Baffin, the voyager of old, Hartly\r\nproposed to brew scurvy-beer for his patients.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII.\r\n\r\nTHE MUSK-OX.\r\n\r\nRejoicing that we trod on firm land once more, Paul Reeves, Hans\r\nPeterkin, and I set off to shoot on the great Island of Sermesoak,\r\nwhich is divided from the mainland of Greenland by the Fin Whale\r\nStrait, while Hartly arranged with the Danish resident at the village\r\nfor such supplies of fresh food as a place so poor could afford.\r\n\r\nLeaving the Isle of Bears, we ran our boat into a creek called\r\nCunninghame's Haven, from John Cunninghame, a Scotsman, who was\r\nAdmiral of Denmark, and who, on his return from Davis' Straits, in\r\n1605, appeared off Greenland with three ships, and carried away some\r\nof the natives, whom he presented to Christian IV., together with a\r\nchain weighing twenty-six ounces, formed of fine silver, found by him\r\namong the rocks at a place still named Cunninghame's Fiord.\r\n\r\nWith all our anxiety to add to the fresh provisions on board, we were\r\nnot without a desire to encounter some of the bears with which one\r\nalways associates the name of Greenland; and ere twenty-four hours\r\nelapsed, I was certainly gratified to the fullest extent in that way.\r\n\r\nThe people of Sermesoak were then in consternation, owing to the\r\ndepredations of a fierce herd of Bruins which had crossed the strait\r\nfrom the mainland, and devoured many of their children, dogs, and\r\nreindeer.\r\n\r\nThese bears are as revengeful and subtle as they are savage.  \"Some\r\nyears ago,\" says a traveller, \"the crew of a boat belonging to a ship\r\nin the whale-fishery shot at a bear and wounded it.  The animal\r\nimmediately uttered the most dreadful howl, and ran along the ice\r\ntowards the boat.  Before he reached it a second shot hit him; this,\r\nhowever, served but to increase his fury.  He presently swam to the\r\nboat, and in attempting to get on board, placed one of his fore-feet\r\non the gunnel; but a sailor, having a hatchet in his hand, cut it\r\noff.  The animal still continued to swim after them, till they\r\narrived at the ship; several shots were fired at him which took\r\neffect, but on reaching the ship he ascended to the deck; and the\r\ncrew having fled into the shrouds, he was actually pursuing them\r\n_thither_ when a shot laid him lifeless on the deck.\"\r\n\r\nAllured by the odour of the seal oil, they had surrounded and broken\r\ninto the dwellings of the natives in herds, and devoured them in\r\ntheir beds; and numerous stories of these terrible _raids_ were told\r\nto Hans (who knew something of the language) by the people of\r\nSermesoak, as we set out on our expedition.\r\n\r\nWe shot several white hares, and consigned them to a large canvas bag\r\nwhich Hans had slung over his shoulder.  In our sporting ardour we\r\npenetrated several miles into the country, and in making a détour to\r\nbeat up for nobler game, I lost my companions among the furze-covered\r\nrocks of a ravine.  Dusk was coming on, and, wearied with halloing, I\r\nsat down to look around me.  I was quite alone and in a strange\r\nplace, but more safe and comfortable in every way than when I was\r\nalone on the ice-floe.  Though in a foreign and barbarous country,\r\nthis reflection set my mind completely at ease.\r\n\r\nA wild and dreary scene lay around me.\r\n\r\nMountains piled on mountains of stern rock rose on every side,\r\ncovered with snow unmarked by footstep, track, or road.  No trees\r\nwere growing there and no verdure was visible, save some patches of\r\nshort grass and moss where the wind had torn the snow from the rocky\r\nsurface.  It seemed as if the icy breath of the Northern Sea, when it\r\nswept through the Fin Whale Strait, destroyed all vegetable nature;\r\nand as for the flowers of spring, one might as well have looked for\r\nthem on an iceberg.\r\n\r\nWhy that country was named the _Green_land, Heaven only knows!\r\n\r\nIn 1610, Jonas Pool, a whaling captain, called it King James'\r\nNewland, from James VI. of Scotland; but that name was soon forgotten.\r\n\r\nAbove me impended a bluff of sullen aspect, the rifts of which formed\r\nthe eyrie of myriads of white sea-gulls and birds like the great\r\nSolan goose of the Scottish isles; and these were whirring,\r\nscreaming, and booming on their broad pinions, as they came home from\r\nthe shore.\r\n\r\nAs the shadows deepened, even these sounds ceased, and nothing met\r\nthe ear but the croak of a lonely raven which sat on a granite\r\nboulder.\r\n\r\nFar away in distance, down below me, stretched the headlands which\r\njutted into the deep blue waters of the Whale Strait--starting up in\r\nfantastic pinnacles and precipitous ridges, like the towers and\r\nturrets of crumbling castles.  These walls of rock were black and\r\nsombre, though their summits were crowned by eternal snow.\r\n\r\nFrom the mountains the sleet and melting snows of ages have long\r\nsince washed away every grain of earth; hence, no verdure can spring\r\nthere, and their rugged fronts present the most harsh and singular\r\noutlines.  The higher ridges are rendered inaccessible by glaciers;\r\nand when the snows melt from their gloomy lichened fronts, long and\r\nsilvery runnels, that seem like threads in the distance, trickle down\r\nthe precipices; then winter comes again, converting these runnels\r\ninto ice, which splits and rends the hardest rock to fragments, that\r\nroll with the sound of thunder down the steep glaciers into the\r\nvalleys below.\r\n\r\nLeaning on my gun, I was surveying this wild and dreary scene, and\r\ncareless alike of the cold and the coming night, was lost in reverie,\r\nwhen a sound aroused me, and on looking up, I saw close by an animal\r\nof strange form, such as I had never seen before, even in a menagerie.\r\n\r\nIt was larger than a pony, but had singularly short limbs, which were\r\nalmost entirely concealed by the long dark hair that covered all its\r\nbody, and reached nearly to the ground.  It had a short tail, and\r\nlarge crooked horns of powerful aspect, with a mass of hair like a\r\nhorse's mane hanging beard-wise under its throat.\r\n\r\nA very strange sensation comes over one on beholding an unknown\r\nanimal for the first time, and on this musk-ox--for such it\r\nwas--approaching, with its large projecting eyes glaring, and while\r\nshaking those formidable horns, by which it can encounter and slay\r\nthe bear and walrus, astonishment soon gave place to alarm, and I\r\nregretted more than ever the absence of my two comrades.\r\n\r\nThe ox was only a pistol-shot distant, so, with my heart beating\r\nquickly--as I knew not what the sequel might be--I levelled my gun,\r\nand fired full at its head.  The animal uttered a bellowing roar,\r\nbounded furiously forward, and fell motionless on its side.\r\n\r\nThe ball had pierced its brain.\r\n\r\nWith a thousand echoes, the report of my gun rang among the hills of\r\nrock, peak after peak seeming to catch the sound and toss it from one\r\nto the other, until it died away on the wind that blew through the\r\nFin Whale Strait.\r\n\r\nI was not without hope that the sound might reach Reeves and Hans\r\nPeterkin, and guide them towards me; but I hoped in vain.\r\n\r\nThe ox I had slain was one of the largest of the Musk species, and\r\nmight have weighed, perhaps, seven hundredweight.  It would, I knew,\r\nprove a most acceptable addition to our scanty stores on board the\r\n_Leda_; moreover, I was not a little vain of having slain, by a\r\nsingle ball, an animal so large and so little known by Europeans; but\r\n_how_ to get it conveyed to the brig, or how to guide any of our crew\r\nto the spot where it lay, were puzzling queries.\r\n\r\nI observed that at the distance of a hundred yards from it, there\r\nrose a steep and rugged rock, cleft into three singular peaks, so\r\nlofty as to be visible from a great distance.  Conceiving this to be\r\na sufficient landmark, I reloaded my gun, and resolved, if possible,\r\nto discover Cunninghame's Haven, where our boat lay.  Without a\r\ntrack, a road, or native to guide me, I toiled over the steep and\r\nrugged mountains, and through ravines and hollows half filled with\r\ndrifted snow, steering my way by the stars in that direction which I\r\nconceived might lead me to our boat.\r\n\r\nTo enhance the wildness and gloomy grandeur of the scenery, there now\r\ncame a wondrous and fan-shaped light over all the clear cold blue of\r\nthe northern sky--a glorious Aurora Borealis.  This light, sent by\r\nHeaven to cheer the lone denizens of that frozen wilderness, spread a\r\nrich and wavering glow over all the northern firmament, playing in\r\nstreaks or lines that alternately faded away, and resumed their\r\ndazzling brilliance.  These alternations fill with awe the simple\r\nGreenlander, who calls them the _Merry Dancers_, and who deems,\r\n\r\n  \"By the streamers that shoot so bright,\r\n  The spirits are riding the Northern light.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nAt times, the whole sky seemed a blaze of diamond-like light, tinged\r\nwith rainbow hues, and in front of these, the stern rocks, crags, and\r\nmountains stood forth in sharp black outline.  Ever and anon, an\r\nelectrical meteor shot athwart the sky, leaving, as these falling\r\nstars always do, a train of momentary light.\r\n\r\nFrequently the long streamers played across this luminous white\r\nradiance as if a mighty fan were being opened and shut, or like the\r\nspokes of some revolving wheel whose axle was at the Pole.  Then a\r\nburst of glory would open in the zenith, and for a moment every\r\nfeature in the desolate landscape and the far-stretching vista of the\r\nWhale Strait between its walls of rocks would be distinctly visible.\r\n\r\nAlone in that sterile solitude, I gazed upon the Aurora with emotions\r\nof mingled awe and wonder, turning again and again to the north, as I\r\nstumbled over rocks and frozen snow piles in my efforts to discover a\r\npath that led to Cunninghame's Haven; so the result was this--that\r\nafter more than an hour of toil, I found that I had been proceeding\r\nin a circle, and came back to the place from whence I had set out,\r\nthe bluff with the three pinnacles, at the foot of which my musk-ox\r\nwas lying; but there a very singular scene presented itself, for my\r\nproperty had already been converted into a banquet by two denizens of\r\nthe wilderness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII.\r\n\r\nTHE FOUR BEARS.\r\n\r\nOn first approaching, I imagined that a heap of snow had fallen from\r\nthe upper rocks on the dead ox, and advanced so close that I was only\r\ntwenty paces from it before discovering in my supposed snow-heap two\r\nenormous white bears who were rending the body asunder with their\r\ngiant claws as one might rend a chicken, and were devouring it with\r\nall the gusto of an appetite whetted by the frosty air.\r\n\r\nTo add to my dismay at this unexpected rencontre, I perceived close\r\nby, some portions of a human body, half-devoured--red, raw, and\r\nappalling!\r\n\r\nA horror came over me, suggesting that this victim might be either\r\nPaul Reeves or Hans Peterkin; and it was not until some time after,\r\nthat I was assured, by fragments of the dress which remained, that\r\nthe unfortunate was a Greenlander, whom they had crushed to death and\r\ndragged away.  Pausing in their banquet, these savage brutes, which\r\nwere of enormous size, uttered a hoarse growl, and while their black\r\nnostrils seemed to snuff the breeze, their deep-set eyes surveyed me\r\nominously.\r\n\r\nMy gun had but a single barrel, thus if I killed one bear I might\r\nfall a prey to the other before there was time to reload; and if my\r\nfirst shot missed, my fate would be sealed by both, as they were\r\ncertain to crush and devour me between them!\r\n\r\nTurning, I fairly fled up the rocks towards the three pinnacles,\r\npursued by the bears, whose progress was slow, as they were evidently\r\ngorged by their double repast on the dead man and the musk-ox.\r\n\r\nTwice I stumbled in my flight, and fell heavily on my hands and face.\r\nMy breath came thickly and fast, and my long seal-skin boots and\r\noveralls, which were strapped up to a waistbelt, greatly incommoded\r\nme; but love of life and dread of a horrible death are sharp\r\nincentives to exertion and activity; thus I struggled to gain a cleft\r\nin the rocks, from whence I might turn and shoot down these unwieldy\r\nmonsters at vantage and at leisure, while they trotted laboriously\r\nafter me, uttering a succession of deep and menacing growls.\r\n\r\nI had left them nearly fifty yards behind, while clambering up the\r\nslope, terrified every instant lest by slipping on the ice-covered\r\nrocks I might roll down under their very paws.  Already I was within\r\ntwenty feet of the cleft, beyond which the dazzling gleam of the\r\nAurora played, when a hoarser growl saluted my ears; and\r\nthere--there--above me in the cleft--in the very haven I was toiling\r\nto reach, appeared a huge brown bear, squatted on his hams, licking\r\nhis great red lips, and quietly waiting my approach!\r\n\r\nBewildered by this new enemy, taken in front and rear, for a moment I\r\nremained irresolute, with my rifle cocked, but not knowing which to\r\nshoot before I met the rest with my weapon clubbed; and now to add\r\nstill more to my dismay and peril, a _fourth_ bear appeared,\r\nadvancing from another point!\r\n\r\nThe monster in the cleft above me, now began to utter hoarse and\r\nsavage roars, in anticipation of my destruction, which seemed\r\ncertain; for those northern bears are so cruel and rapacious, that\r\nthe female secludes her cubs (of which she never has more than two at\r\na litter) from the male, lest he should devour them during the first\r\nmonth of their blindness.  I leave the reader to judge of my emotion\r\non finding my single self opposed to _four_ such antagonists; for the\r\nwhite Greenland bears are double the size of those melancholy looking\r\nbrown brutes whom one may see dancing in the streets at home, being\r\ngenerally about twelve feet long.\r\n\r\nI was blindly desperate, yet my heart did not entirely fail; and I\r\nfelt forcibly \"how an influence beyond our control lays its strong\r\nhand on every deed we do, and weaves its iron tissue of necessity.\"\r\n\r\nClambering up the flinty face of the rocks to elude the three,\r\nfinding footing where, under circumstances less exciting, I might\r\nhave found none, I ascended resolutely towards the bear which stood\r\nin the cleft snuffing the air, roaring, and showing his glistening\r\nteeth.  Already his hot and fetid breath began to taint the air about\r\nme.  I was within six feet of him, when, taking an aim there was no\r\ndoubt would be true, I fired, and the conical ball pierced deeply\r\ninto his vast chest.\r\n\r\nMaddened by pain, Bruin made a wild bound at me, but missed his mark,\r\nas I crouched low; so he rolled, dead I suppose, to the bottom of the\r\nrocks, in his progress tumbling over one of those which were in\r\npursuit of me.  Springing into the cleft he had so lately occupied, I\r\nhastened to reload, and defend my position, for only one brute at a\r\ntime could assail me, unless there were, as I feared, others among\r\nthe rocks in my rear.\r\n\r\nNow what were my emotions on discovering that in my exertions, while\r\nstruggling up the rocks, the strap of my shot-belt had given way, and\r\nthat I had _lost_ it, with all my ammunition!\r\n\r\nA wild perplexity filled my heart, and a cold perspiration burst over\r\nmy temples; but at that moment of desperation a happy thought\r\noccurred to me.\r\n\r\nRemembering that I had a long clasp-knife, which opened and shut with\r\na spring, I applied it in bayonet-fashion to my rifle, and with my\r\nhandkerchief lashed it hard and fast to the muzzle and ramrod head.\r\nThis was barely accomplished, when one of the bears had its fore-paws\r\non the edge of the rock whereon I stood, and by the light of the\r\nstars I could see his fierce red eyes, his long white teeth, and\r\nenormous claws, while burying my impromptu bayonet thrice in his\r\ngreat broad breast, and then the blood flowed darkly over his pure\r\nwhite coat.  The wounds were not deep enough to kill him at once, so\r\nuttering roar after roar, the infuriated bear scraped away with his\r\nhind feet, making vigorous but ineffectual efforts to reach me, till\r\nby a furious kick I drove one of his paws off the ledge of rock.  The\r\nother relaxed immediately, and then Bruin rolled like a great\r\nfeatherbed to the bottom, about thirty feet below, where he moved no\r\nmore.\r\n\r\nBut in a moment a second bear took his place.  Emotion almost\r\nexhausted me; but in my confusion when charging him, fortunately my\r\nknife was thrust into his right eye.  He uttered a hideous cry,\r\nbetween a bellow of rage and a moan of agony, and fell down the\r\nrocks--also dead!\r\n\r\nThe weapon had evidently penetrated to the brain, and killed him.\r\n\r\nA wild and joyous glow now filled my heart.  It was a triumphant\r\nemotion, a lust for destruction and revenge, after the terror I had\r\nendured; and I believe that had a whole army of bears appeared, I\r\nshould, without fear, have encountered them--one by one.\r\n\r\nUttering a \"hurrah\" just as the fourth bear arrived at my feet, I was\r\nabout to charge him as I had done the others when--oh, terror!--the\r\nknotting of my handkerchief gave way, and the knife dropped from the\r\nmuzzle of my gun, and fell to the bottom of the rocks.\r\n\r\nClubbing the weapon, I rained a torrent of blows upon the great head\r\nof this new assailant, which seemed the largest and most ferocious of\r\nthem all, as he probably had neither partaken of the poor Greenlander\r\nor of that most unlucky musk-ox, the slaying of which had no doubt\r\nbrought me into this perilous predicament; but my blows fell on his\r\nfur-covered skull as harmlessly as they would have fallen on a bale\r\nof cotton.\r\n\r\nFuriously I struck with butt and barrel at his broad black nose and\r\ngreat round paws, the deadly claws of which grasped the rock with the\r\ntenacity of iron hooks.  Bruin uttered neither roar nor other sound,\r\nbut concentrating all his energies, drew up his hams, made a vigorous\r\nspring, and in a moment I was dashed to the ground--his hot and\r\nhorrible breath was in my nostrils and on my face, while his weight\r\npressed me down as he prepared to hug or crush me to death.  But now\r\na gun-shot rang between the rocks of the deep chasm, and I found\r\nmyself suddenly freed.  Pierced through the heart by a single\r\nwell-aimed ball, the bear rolled over me dead, a quivering mass of\r\nflesh and fur!\r\n\r\nSo severely was I stunned by the shock of Bruin's attack, and so\r\nconfused by the whole combat, that some minutes elapsed before I had\r\nsufficient strength or breath to thank my preserver, to whom I might\r\nas well have spoken in Greek or Choctaw, as he proved to be a poor\r\nGreenlander who had never heard a word of English before.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV.\r\n\r\nWOLMAR FYNBÖE.\r\n\r\nAfter various efforts to make ourselves mutually understood, he said\r\nsomething in a kind of jargon which resembled German, and as I had\r\nlearned that language at home for commercial rather than literary\r\npurposes, we contrived to converse, though not with great fluency,\r\nusing grimaces and signs when words failed us, which was a\r\ncircumstance of frequent occurrence.\r\n\r\nHe informed me that he had been searching for a friend who came forth\r\nto hunt for a musk-ox, which had been seen in their district, and who\r\nhe feared had fallen a victim to its horns or the bear's paws.\r\n\r\n\"I shot the musk-ox,\" said I; \"and as for your friend, I fear your\r\nsurmises are only too correct, for the half-devoured remains of a\r\ndead man are lying at the foot of these rocks just now.\"\r\n\r\nHe hurried to the base of the precipice, where I was too exhausted to\r\nfollow him, and by the sounds of rage and lamentation which preceded\r\nhis return, I was assured that his friend or kinsman had been the\r\nvictim of these rapacious brutes.  This comforted me, however, with\r\nthe conviction that the remains were neither those of Paul Reeves nor\r\nold Peterkin, our second mate.\r\n\r\nBut, meantime, where were they?\r\n\r\nThe Greenlander rejoined me, with my shot-belt and gory knife, which\r\nhe found among the rocks.  He thanked me for so amply avenging his\r\nfriend's death on his destroyers, and proceeded at once to calculate\r\nthe value of the four skins and eight hams of the bears.  He invited\r\nme to his house, which he said was not far off, adding that his name\r\nwas Wolmar Fynböe; that he was a merchant who exported to Europe\r\nseal-skins, the horns of the sea-unicorn, whalebone, and blubber;\r\nbartering these, and the skins of blue and white foxes, hares, and\r\nbears, for knives and guns, shot, tobacco, barley, beer and brandy,\r\n&c.; that he had once been as far as Kiobenhaven,[*] but did not like\r\nthe manners of the _kablunaet_ (foreigners), who were but half men\r\nwhen compared to the Greenlanders; for national vanity is a great\r\ncharacteristic of these poor people, as it is of many others even\r\nless civilized.\r\n\r\n\r\n[*] Copenhagen.\r\n\r\n\r\nLike the Lapps, he wore a long pelisse of untanned reindeer skin,\r\nhaving a hood like a friar's cowl attached thereto, and buttons of\r\nwalrus teeth.  His hose, boots, and breeches, which were all in one,\r\nwere of the same material, but decorated at the sides by bunches of\r\nthongs and tufts of white bearskin.  Thus, but for his fair\r\ncomplexion, he might have passed very well for an Esquimau of the\r\nLabrador coast.\r\n\r\nI gladly committed myself to his guidance.\r\n\r\nWe soon reached his house, a dwelling of singular aspect, built on\r\nthe slope of a snow-covered hill which overlooked the Fin Whale\r\nStrait, on the waters of which the rays of the northern Aurora were\r\nstill playing with wondrous beauty; and from thence he dispatched\r\nsome of his men to bring home the remains of his friend, the dead\r\nbears, and the head of the musk-ox.\r\n\r\nWe were received at the door by an old servant, a woman of fearful\r\naspect, also dressed in skins; but these were adorned by stripes of\r\nred and blue leather to indicate her sex.  She was aged, and being of\r\n\"the _old_ school\"--for there is one there, even in Greenland--she\r\nwas tattooed as completely as if she had been a denizen of Nootka\r\nSound.  Aloft in her hand, which resembled a crow's talons, she held\r\na lamp to light us into an inner apartment, where Wolmar Fynböe\r\nintroduced me to his daughters, two girls dressed in skins; but these\r\nwere neatly adorned with variously-coloured leather, especially about\r\nthe moccassins which encased their trim legs.  Their dresses were cut\r\nlow at the neck, either to reveal its whiteness (for females have\r\nvanity even in that region of ice), or to display their under\r\ngarments, which were formed of the skins of little birds, ingeniously\r\npreserved, sewn together, and worn with the soft feathers next the\r\nskin.\r\n\r\nWolmar Fynböe was the tallest man in Greenland, yet he measured only\r\nfive feet; and though deemed handsome, he had all the peculiarities\r\nof his race--to wit, a paunchy figure, a broad flat visage, of a\r\nbrown brick-dust colour; small eyes, thick lips, and coal-black\r\nlocks, that waved upon his shoulders like those of a gnome.\r\nNevertheless, his daughters Grethe and Alfa had rather regular\r\nfeatures, clear complexions, and long brown hair, their mother having\r\nbeen a woman of Iceland.\r\n\r\nThey were preparing a supper of _grod_ (Danish), a species of food\r\nmade of oats or barley, and eaten with butter and milk, when their\r\nfather's entrance with a _stranger_--a being more seldom seen than\r\nmermaids and gnomes, by common report--startled them so much, that\r\nsome time elapsed before they could resume their occupation, and\r\nswing upon the fire the great pot-stone kettle containing the\r\naforesaid _grod_ with my assistance--in proffering which I won the\r\nhearts of all, politeness to females being rather a rarity on the\r\nshore of the Fin Whale Strait.\r\n\r\nThe large fire burned brightly and cheerily, being composed of\r\ndrift-wood; for upon that barren coast, in addition to the stranded\r\nwrecks of Scottish and Russian whalers, are found at times the spoil\r\nof the Great Gulf Stream, the palmettoes of South America, and,\r\ncovered with weeds and barnacles, the vast logs that whilome cast the\r\nshadows of their foliage on the lovely Bay of Honduras.  By this\r\nstrange current the spoils of Virginia and Carolina are also cast on\r\nthe shores of Iceland, and by it the main-mast of H.M.S. _Tilbury_,\r\nwhich was burned in Jamaica, was thrown upon the western coast of\r\nScotland.\r\n\r\nAfter having fed so long upon the spoils of the ice--the odds and\r\nends of seals and blubber--I made a veritable banquet with the worthy\r\nmerchant and his two daughters.  Then we had the luxury of hot\r\nbrandy-and-water thereafter--the Ganymede who served us being, ugh!\r\nthe old tattooed woman.\r\n\r\nI have mentioned that the mansion of Weimar Fynböe presented a\r\ncurious aspect, but this arose from the circumstance of its being (as\r\nhe informed me) built from the remains of an old whale-ship of large\r\ndimensions, which had been cast away in the Fin Whale Strait about\r\none hundred and fifty years ago.  Her ribs and timbers formed the\r\nroof and uprights of the walls; on these the outer and inner\r\nsheathing were bolted or pegged anew, and filled-in between with moss\r\nand turf.  The lockers in which her cabin stores had been placed were\r\nour seats, the beds were her berths; the room of the fur-clad Grethe\r\nand Alfa was merely separated from ours by an old bulkhead, in the\r\ncentre of which a cabin door was hinged.  The four stern-windows were\r\nframed into the wall, a luxury, a piece of splendour, in Greenland,\r\nwhere the casements are usually formed of the entrails of seals and\r\ndolphins dried, and neatly stitched together.  Some faded charts were\r\nnailed on the wall as pictures.  An old musket or two, and a\r\npinchbeck watch, were nearly all that now remained of the spoil found\r\nin the ship, which had been deserted by her crew; but from none of\r\nthese relics could her name or country be discerned, though I\r\nsupposed her to have been English from the circumstance of a Bible\r\nand little book in that language having been found in her by the\r\ngrandfather of Wolmar Fynböe, who built his house from her materials.\r\n\r\nThe \"little book\" Wolmar showed me.  It was a curious black-letter\r\npamphlet, printed at London in the time of Charles II., and in Dutch\r\ntypes.  I took a particular fancy for it, as it contained the\r\nrelation of a perilous voyage performed by a ship which belonged to\r\nthe Seven United Provinces.\r\n\r\nWolmar Fynböe offered to barter it for the horns of the musk-ox; but\r\nI assured him that he was welcome alike to the entire head, the\r\nbears' skins, and hams to boot.  To this he agreed at once,\r\nconceiving, probably, that one who parted so readily with spoil did\r\nnot deserve to possess any; so I retired with my literary acquisition\r\n(the contents of which I shall give to the reader elsewhere), begging\r\nWolmar Fynböe to have me summoned betimes in the morning, as I was\r\nmost anxious to reach Cunninghame's Haven, and rejoin my friends on\r\nboard the _Leda_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV.\r\n\r\nADIEU TO THE REGION OF ICE.\r\n\r\nNext morning I was up early, my bed not being exactly so luxurious as\r\nI could have wished; and there was about everything that overpowering\r\nodour of blubber which pervades a Greenland household.  For\r\nbreakfast, Grethe brought in a gaily-painted Muscovite bowl, full of\r\nwarm milk, and a hot barley-cake, made by Alfa.  Her father soon\r\nafter brought my gun, cleaned and oiled; and then bidding adieu in\r\nrather symbolical language to his daughters, we set forth into the\r\nclear, cold atmosphere of the young May morning--for we were now in\r\nwhat is deemed in kindlier climes the second month of summer--but as\r\nyet no sun was visible.\r\n\r\nFar away in distance stretched the Fin Whale Strait, towards Kalla\r\nFiord, which opens into the Icy Sea; its broken scenery, its\r\nsplintered crags, its lofty bluffs and pinnacles, exhibiting the most\r\nsingular combinations of light and shadow in the yellow blaze of the\r\nyet unrisen sun.  The summits seemed tipped with fire, while the\r\nbases which rose sheer from the still, deep waters of the waveless\r\nstrait were dark and sombre as ebony.\r\n\r\nWaveless it truly was, save where broken by the knoblike head of a\r\nblackfin-whale, as he swam against the wind, and blew clouds of water\r\ninto the air.\r\n\r\nAs we proceeded, I could perceive that Wolmar Fynböe, though merry\r\nand good-humoured, like all Greenlanders was deeply imbued with\r\nsuperstitions dark and gloomy as those of the Scandinavian Edda.\r\nLeaning on his hunting-spear, he pointed to a rock in the strait,\r\nsaying that his mother's sister Alfa (from whom he named his youngest\r\ndaughter) was wont to see a handsome young merman seated thereon,\r\nevery time she came to the beach to gather shell-fish or dry nets.\r\n\r\n\"A merman!\" I reiterated, believing that I had not heard him\r\ncorrectly.\r\n\r\n\"A merman,\" continued Fynböe, emphatically.  \"His curling beard was\r\ngreen, and his features, like those of the _Innuit_ (Greenlanders),\r\nwere as soft and pleasing as his manner was mild and persuasive.  He\r\ntook her by the hand, and after their fourth meeting led her under\r\nthe sea, where she lived with him at the bottom of the Fin Whale\r\nStrait for a great many years, and never grew less beautiful, though\r\nshe frequently pined for the dwelling of her mother, whom at times\r\nshe could behold from the windows of her watery home, every summer\r\nwhen the ice-floes floated out to sea, and the young whales came to\r\nplay about the headlands in the sunny waves.\r\n\r\n\"One summer came, but the old woman appeared no more on the slope of\r\nthe hill; and then Alfa knew that her sorrowing mother had gone to\r\nthe Island of the Dead.\r\n\r\n\"Alfa dwelt with the merman, till one night as he was sporting about\r\nin the moonbeams amid the waters of the strait, Grön Jette, the wild\r\nhuntsman, who once in every year comes over the sea at midnight out\r\nof Denmark, slew him by a blow of his lance, as he sped with his\r\nyelling hounds and fierce black horses over land and ocean towards\r\nthe north, where the bright streamers were dancing.\r\n\r\n\"The spell was thus broken; and the young girl found herself turned\r\nsuddenly into an old woman, seated on the same rock where, twenty\r\nyears before, the merman had wooed and won her; but now seven\r\nwell-grown children with fish-tails, and hair that was half green\r\nlike her husband's and half golden like her own, were swimming about\r\nin the flood before her, weeping for her return.  So, to rejoin them,\r\nshe plunged in and was drowned--for the spell of the merman's\r\npresence was no longer around her.  Next day I found her body\r\nfloating in the strait, and by a string of crystals round her neck,\r\nknew her to be the sister my mother had lost twenty years before.  We\r\nbore her to the Island of the Dead; and as we use no coffins, like\r\nthe red-haired Danes, we heaped up stones to hide her from view; but\r\na bear swam off from Sermesoak, tore our gathered heap asunder, and\r\ndevoured her!\"\r\n\r\nWolmar Fynböe rehearsed this strange story with the utmost good\r\nfaith; for he was simple enough to believe that Torngarsück, the God\r\nof Greenland--a spirit which, though no larger than one's thumb, at\r\ntimes assumes the form of a gigantic white bear--dwelt at the bottom\r\nof the Whale Strait, with his wife the Demon of Evil, guarded by\r\ndroves of narwhals and ferocious seals, and surrounded by vast lamps\r\nfilled with train-oil, in which the sea-birds swam by night.\r\n\r\nWith many a strange story of witches, and conflicts with whales,\r\nwalruses, and with devils that sailed through the air and changed\r\nthemselves into snowdrifts to overwhelm belated hunters, he beguiled\r\nthe way, until we reached Cunninghame's Haven, where I found Paul\r\nReeves and Hans Peterkin awaiting me in considerable anxiety, and\r\nirresolute whether to put off for the Bear Isle and report to Hartly\r\nthat I had been lost, or to return once more in search of me.\r\n\r\nI now gave the honest Greenlander two crown pieces, as neck amulets\r\nfor each of his daughters (among whose descendants they may become\r\nheirlooms for ages), and bidding him farewell, we stepped into our\r\nboat, which was well stocked with game--a large white bear, a pile of\r\nhares, and several brace of birds shot by the two mates.  Then we\r\nshoved off to join the _Leda_, and Wolmar Fynböe, ever and anon\r\npausing to look after us, slowly ascended the cliffs, assisted by his\r\nharpoon-shaped hunting spear, and at last disappeared on the path to\r\nhis half-barbarous and wholly secluded home.\r\n\r\nIn two hours after, we reached the _Leda_, which had her courses\r\nloose, a signal for sea.  Our quota of provisions proved a very\r\nacceptable addition to those obtained by Hartly from the Danish\r\nresident.\r\n\r\n\"Bravo, Jack!\" said he, as we hoisted the bear on board, \"our\r\nvictualling department is complete now, and if this wind holds we\r\nshall weigh an hour before sunset.\"\r\n\r\n\"But the victualling--of what does it consist?\"\r\n\r\n\"The dainties--the luxuries of Greenland!\"\r\n\r\n\"Indeed,\" said I, doubtfully.\r\n\r\n\"In exchange for a few hundred seal-skins, and some kegs of rancid\r\nblubber, we have got pickled bear's flesh, bull-heads, gulls and\r\nbelugas, salmon-trout, and reindeer tongues, hares and partridges in\r\npickle, with a few tubs of whortleberries, preserved in oil.  We\r\nshall have the white bear in the cabin to ourselves.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why?\"\r\n\r\n\"Sailors won't eat white bear hams?\"\r\n\r\n\"But why?\"\r\n\r\n\"They assert that the flesh makes their hair grey.  We have also a\r\ncask of sorrel preserved in blubber.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ugh! of course; but for what purpose?\"\r\n\r\n\"As a preservative against scurvy.  And now up blue-peter, man the\r\nwindlass, and heave short on the anchor!\"\r\n\r\nWe sailed an hour before sunset; and ere the pale white moon rose\r\nfrom the sea, the jagged pinnacles of Sermesoak and the stormy bluff\r\nof Cape Farewell were melting into the brilliant sky astern, while\r\nour sailors sang cheerily as they hoisted the working anchor on\r\nboard, unbent the chain-cable and stowed it in the tier.  The month\r\nbeing May we had the light of the sun nearly all night, though in the\r\ndaytime he only rises thirty-three degrees above the horizon.\r\n\r\nHowever, we lit our binnacle lamps when he set, the sails were\r\ntrimmed for a south-west course, and now we fairly bore away into the\r\nmighty ocean, and bade adieu for ever to the REGION OF ICE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI.\r\n\r\nA SHARK.\r\n\r\nFor the fourth time during our rambling voyage, the _Leda_ was again\r\nfree and under sail upon the blue and boundless sea.\r\n\r\nI cannot describe the emotions of joy with which, after our recent\r\nlong imprisonment amid the waste of ice we gazed upon its buoyant\r\nripples shining in the sun of May.  Its broad vast bosom of\r\nresplendent blue--a blue so indicative of immensity--that spread far\r\naway beyond the dim horizon, flecked with tiny floes of ice, seemed\r\nas the mirror wherein we could trace the future.\r\n\r\nIt was freedom, it was the high road to our homes, to sunshine and\r\nthe genial south.  Everything was set that would draw--royals, flying\r\njib, and studding-sails, as we bore on with a breeze, which, though\r\nkeen, cold, and cutting, enabled us soon to leave the clime of frost\r\nand suffering, bears and icebergs far astern.\r\n\r\nOn the second day we passed a ship waterlogged and dismasted,\r\nbattered, and abandoned.  Her boats, bulwarks, and everything had\r\nbeen swept from her decks.  We bore down upon her, but there was no\r\nsign of life on board, so we hauled our wind again and left her to\r\ndrift, where she would no doubt prove a prize, on the sterile coast\r\nof Greenland.\r\n\r\nOne day a shark followed us with singular pertinacity, eluding every\r\nshot we fired at his black dorsal fin from our rifles and sealing\r\nguns, till Hans Peterkin, who was skilful in the use of the harpoon,\r\nevidently wounded the monster by a well-directed blow over our stern\r\nquarter, after which our enemy disappeared.  Old Hans exulted\r\nconsiderably in his victory, but awoke that night in the midst of a\r\nfrightful dream, and alarmed all his shipmates by crying out that a\r\nshark was devouring him.\r\n\r\n\"Take care, Hans,\" grumbled Tom Hammer, as he turned in his hammock,\r\nannoyed on being roused from a sound sleep, \"don't be falling\r\noverboard, for it is my belief that Jack Shark is in the dead water\r\nastern yet, looking out for his revenge.\"\r\n\r\nThis passed as a joke at the time, but next day it had a singular\r\nsequel.\r\n\r\nWe were almost becalmed.  From being light and variable, the wind had\r\nnearly died away.  The sea was smooth as if oil covered all its\r\nsurface; the listless canvas hung asleep, or flapped heavily as the\r\nmasts swayed to and fro, the reef points pattering, as the _Leda_\r\nrolled lazily on the long glassy ridges that swelled up and shone in\r\nthe meridian sun.\r\n\r\nAmid the general apathy which such a state of matters produces on\r\nboard of a ship, we were roused by the cry of \"a dolphin alongside;\"\r\nand though these fish are generally met in droves, when the waves are\r\nbreaking and the wind blowing fresh, one was seen rising and sinking,\r\nas if sporting in the sunshine.\r\n\r\nImmediately Hans appeared on the bowsprit, armed with his Orkney\r\nharpoon, a long spear pointed with barbed iron.  Rapidly he bent the\r\nline to the foreganger of his weapon, and grasping it, with a handful\r\nof slack in his right hand, he slid under the bowsprit, and along the\r\nmartingale stays which are stretched taut to the end of the jib-boom.\r\nClasping the vertical spar of the martingale with his left arm, he\r\ntook a steady aim at the dolphin, and launched his harpoon with all\r\nhis strength.\r\n\r\nThe stroke was followed by a shout from the crew, who crowded into\r\nthe bows and forerigging, for poor Hans had overstruck himself, and\r\nafter swinging violently round the martingale, fell into the sea,\r\nmissing the dolphin, which instantly disappeared.\r\n\r\n\"My dream--oh, my dream!\" cried old Hans in terror, as he rose\r\nfloundering and sputtering to the surface.\r\n\r\nThen came the appalling cry of \"A shark! a shark!\" and in the very\r\nplace where the dolphin sank, the short crooked fin of this great\r\nmonster of the deep was seen making straight towards Hans, who,\r\nthough an expert swimmer, a hard-a-weather salt, accustomed to all\r\nthe hardships and terrors of Ultima Thule and his native Orcades, was\r\nstruggling wildly for life, having got entangled in the slack line of\r\nhis harpoon.\r\n\r\n\"Captain Hartly--man overboard! a rope--a rope!\"\r\n\r\n\"Cut away the life-buoy!\"\r\n\r\n\"Lower away the stern-boat!\"\r\n\r\nSuch were the cries on every hand, while the current soon swept\r\nPeterkin past the brig, till he was nearly fifty yards astern.\r\n\r\nOld Hans uttered a cry of despair, echoed by a groan from all, and\r\nsank!\r\n\r\nRegardless of the shark, which was then double the distance of Hans\r\nfrom us, Hartly, who had rushed on deck at the first alarm, with the\r\nrapidity of thought, threw off his coat, knotted a line round his\r\nwaist, lowered himself into the mainchains, and joining the palms of\r\nhis hands together in the cut-water fashion of a diver, urging the\r\nwhile his agile body by a sharp push from the chain-plate, sprang\r\ninto the sea, and vanished amid the ripples.  Then in half minute or\r\nless he reappeared with Hans, whose grey locks he grasped firmly, as\r\nhe cast upward a glance of mingled hope and terror--hope of aid from\r\nhis crew, and terror of the monster, which was shooting towards them;\r\nfor though the ring of Mother Jensdochter was to save him from\r\ndrowning, the good dame omitted all mention of sea-lawyers.\r\n\r\n\"Down with the stern-boat!\" cried Reeves.\r\n\r\nIn a moment the falls were cast loose and the boat was lowered from\r\nthe davits, manned, and shoved off with a rapidity which nothing but\r\nthe discipline of the crew and their love for Hartly could have\r\nensured!  Save those in the boat, all held their breath--all were\r\nparalysed by the scene, and our complete inability to aid or to\r\nprotect our friends.  However, the splashing of the half-drowned Hans\r\nsomewhat scared the monster, and kept him off.\r\n\r\nThe boat soon reached the spot; they were drawn on board, and just in\r\ntime, for the shark's nose was close to Hans' heels, while a hearty\r\nhurrah greeted him and his gallant preserver.\r\n\r\nEre the boat was again dangling at the stern davits, the shark, which\r\nhad now recovered his surprise and the alarm Hans' splashing had\r\noccasioned him, was seen darting furiously to and fro in search of a\r\nvictim; and but for the celerity of our boat's crew, one or other\r\nmust have perished in his horrible jaws.  Though the shark has rarely\r\nthe power to bite a man in two, he can strip the flesh from his body\r\nin such a manner, that death is sure to follow.\r\n\r\nThe wind freshened after this, and the ship's course was resumed; but\r\nas night came on, the studdingsails and royals were taken in.  Hans\r\nappeared in very low spirits after his recent adventure, so Hartly\r\nexcused him from deck duty for that night.  Then, as we sat over our\r\ngrog in the cabin, the deck being in charge of Tom Hammer, Hartly\r\nsaid--\r\n\r\n\"By the bye, Jack, you said something of finding an old printed yarn\r\nabout a shipwreck in Skipper Fynböe's house in Greenland.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes--a queer old story it seems.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let us have it, then; read it aloud.  Cuffy, trim the lamps; bring\r\nanother case-bottle from the locker, and shut the cabin door.  Pass\r\nword for Mr. Reeves and Hans Peterkin to step down--Mr. Manly is\r\nabout to spin us a yarn.\"\r\n\r\nI soon produced my little story-book, of which (as it was an\r\nauthentic narrative) I shall give the exact title; though I prefer to\r\nrehearse the contents in my own manner, as the language and spelling\r\nof its author are somewhat quaint and antiquated.\r\n\r\nIt was called \"The Wonderfull and Tragical!  Relation of a Voyage\r\nfrom the Indies, printed at the Black Raven, in Duck Lane, A.D. 1684.\"\r\n\r\nThe substance thereof was as follows.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVII.\r\n\r\nTHE FATAL VOYAGE OF THE HEER VAN ESTELL.\r\n\r\nIt was in the month of August, 1670, that the barque _De Ruyter_,\r\nbearing the flag of the Seven United Provinces (then under their High\r\nMightinesses the States General) and named after Michael Adrian de\r\nRuyter, Admiral of Holland--the same valiant mariner who beat the\r\nEnglish, burned Chatham, and bombarded Tilbury--left the port of\r\nPernambuco, in Peru, for Rotterdam, tacking carefully to avoid the\r\nshoals and rocks which made the Portuguese of old name it the \"Mouth\r\nof Hell\"--_Inferno-bocca_--hence its present corrupted name.\r\n\r\nShe was manned by Captain Koningsmarke and sixteen seamen; she\r\ncarried four brass guns, and had her stern decorated by the lions,\r\nspotted sable and gules, which form the arms of Rotterdam.  Her mate\r\nwas an Englishman named Carpinger, a brave and skilful seaman.\r\n\r\nAs passengers, she had the Heer Van Estell, his wife Gudule, their\r\ntwo little children, Erasmus and Cornelius, with Dame Trüdchen, their\r\nfaithful old nurse.  The Heer was a native of the Low Countries, who,\r\nafter a long residence in the Dutch colony at Brazil, had amassed a\r\nmagnificent fortune, and risen to be a Director of the Company of the\r\nGreat Indies, a dignity which no one could attain unless he vested\r\ntwelve thousand guilders in the old stock.  Now, having amassed all\r\nthe wealth he deemed desirable, with his wife and children--little\r\ncurly-haired Erasmus, whom he had named after the great philosopher\r\nof Rotterdam (towards whose statue in the Bürger-platz he gave a\r\nthousand rix-dollars), and chubby little Cornelius, whom he had named\r\nafter Cornelius de Witt, who, with his brother, was so barbarously\r\nassassinated by William of Orange (and afterwards of England)--he was\r\nreturning to his native city to spend his days in peace and quiet,\r\nwith the three beings whom he loved most on earth.\r\n\r\nThe day was cloudless and clear, the wind was fair, but light, and\r\nwhile the bark, with all her canvas set, from her flying-jib to her\r\nspanker, and with the colours of the Seven Provinces flying at her\r\ngaff-peak, passed in safety the flat sandbanks of St. Antonio, and\r\nthat long reef which receives the full force of the sea, and guards\r\nthe town of Recife, the tall and portly Heer, with his beautiful wife\r\nand chubby little ones beside him, sat in a cushioned chair on the\r\nwarm deck, enjoying a long pipe of tobacco with all the ease and\r\ncomplacency that became a wealthy Hollander and Director of the Great\r\nIndia Company.\r\n\r\nWithout any emotion, save joy that he was returning, he saw the hill\r\nof Olinda, the tall slender spires of the town, and the grim\r\nbatteries of Cinco Pontas, melt in the distance astern, as the _De\r\nRuyter_ bore away into the Western Ocean.\r\n\r\nFor more than a month the voyage was delightful and prosperous; but\r\nadverse winds came anon, and storms too; and Captain Koningsmarke was\r\nblown out of his course; moreover, he lost his reckoning, as the sky\r\nremained obscured by clouds, and for weeks both quadrant and sextant\r\nwere used in vain.\r\n\r\nHis anxiety and that of the Heer became great, for provisions were\r\nbecoming scarce--so much so that, ere long, all on board received but\r\na scanty allowance.  Then Van Estell and Dame Gudule beheld with\r\nsecret agony the roses fading from the cheeks of their children,\r\ntheir pretty faces becoming blanched, and their once round forms\r\nattenuated.\r\n\r\nWeek after week rolled anxiously, mournfully away!\r\n\r\nStill the winds were adverse, and still the _De Ruyter_ tacked and\r\ntacked again, like the fabled ship of Vanderdecken, but without\r\nmeeting a craft that might assist them, till at last there fell a\r\ndeath-like calm upon the sea; and then, for many, many days under a\r\nhot sun, and in the breathless nights that followed, the helpless\r\nvessel lay like a log, with her blocks and cordage rattling, and her\r\nloose canvas flapping until it was frittered and frayed on the\r\nblistering yards and masts, while the sea chafed her rusting\r\nchain-plates and the pitch boiled from her planking--yet \"she lay so\r\nthat, for several weeks, they could scarcely tell whether they were\r\nforwarded a league's space.\"\r\n\r\nAnd now a deadly pest broke out on board--a malignant fever, which\r\ncovered its victims with livid blotches, like the spotted lions,\r\ngules and sable, on the ship's stern; and among those who perished\r\nwere Koningsmarke, the captain, and eight of his crew.  They were\r\nthrown overboard, and for days their bodies remained in sight, with\r\nfishes sporting about them, and obscene birds of the sea lighting on\r\nthem, as they floated on its still and waveless surface.\r\n\r\nProvisions were now dealt out more sparingly than ever.  Strong men\r\ngrew wan, and gaunt, and feeble; for as their strength failed and\r\nhope faded, so did their spirit die within them; and then even the\r\nmost superstitious ceased to _whistle_ for wind.\r\n\r\nAt last they were reduced to a half biscuit and single morsel of meat\r\nper day; the latter failed, and then the half biscuit; and now they\r\nlooked grimly and terribly in each other's hollow visages and\r\nbloodshot eyes, while wondering what was to become of them, for\r\nalthough lines had long hung overboard, the sea had refused to yield\r\nthem fish.\r\n\r\n\"To wait with hope is nothing, but to wait with DESPAIR is worse than\r\ndeath!\"\r\n\r\nSo did the Heer Van Estell wait, and his wife Gudule--now no longer\r\nthe beautiful Gudule, for she was wan, wasted, and sinking, having\r\ngiven her pittance of food for several days to sustain her little\r\nones.  All his wealth, all the riches acquired by years of prudence\r\nin the Indies, would the unhappy Van Estell have given gladly to\r\npurchase a single biscuit, to sustain for one day more the lives of\r\nthose he loved so well.\r\n\r\nAt last little Erasmus and Cornelius died, passing away without pain\r\nor a murmur, having become of late too weak even to weep for food.\r\n\r\nThey passed away, and the Heer and his wife remained by the pretty\r\ncorpses as if transformed to stone!\r\n\r\nFour days passed after this--still no food--no hope--no wind in the\r\nair, no ship upon the sea!\r\n\r\nGudule could not consent to cast her dead children into its mighty\r\ndepth; but anon she repented of it bitterly, for the eight seamen who\r\nremained, after a long conference on the forecastle, and frequently\r\ncasting glances aft towards the cabin--glances like those of\r\nwolves--came in a body, and demanded that the dead children should be\r\nsurrendered to them as _food_!\r\n\r\nThe entreaties and tears of the parents were vain.  The Heer (now\r\nshorn of his strength) and his miserable helpmate were thrust into\r\ntheir cabin, while the wasted bodies of their children were borne\r\naway and laid on the drum of the capstan, where they were cut to\r\npieces by the cook's knife, and then devoured raw.  Hunger seemed to\r\nmake the sailors insane, and able to overcome all aversion for food\r\nso unnatural; but whether it was that they ate immoderately, or that\r\nwith satiety came a horror of their meal, I know not, but they were\r\nimmediately assailed by a dreadful sickness, which left their bodies\r\nweaker than ever.\r\n\r\nGudule lay in a stupor on her bed, but the Heer loaded his pistols,\r\nthough scarcely knowing for what purpose; and exerting all his\r\nstrength, he contrived to burst open the cabin door and stagger on\r\ndeck, when the crew, whom the hunger of another day assailed again,\r\nhad just concluded the last of a second dreadful banquet--a banquet\r\non his children!\r\n\r\nOn the capstan there lay the head of one.  It had the fair curly\r\nlocks of little Erasmus.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, madness and agony!\" groaned the miserable Van Estell, as he took\r\nit in his tremulous hands, kissed it tenderly thrice, and slowly and\r\nsolemnly dropped it into the glassy sea.\r\n\r\nHe could not weep--his hot dry eyes refused a tear, but groans burst\r\nfrom his overcharged breast and parched lips, and he swooned on the\r\ndeck.  There he lay, and so another day passed.  When he recovered it\r\nwas about the time of midnight, and a full round moon was shining on\r\nthat now neglected ship of death and of despair.\r\n\r\nThe atmosphere was mild and warm.\r\n\r\nThe Heer stole into the cabin, and saw that his poor, sad, childless\r\nwife lay very still and motionless.  Tremblingly he drew near, lest\r\nshe might be dead; for then he had resolved to cast her and himself\r\ninto the sea, lest her fair form might also be devoured by the madmen\r\non deck.  But she was in a soft sleep, dreaming, perhaps, that her\r\nlost little ones were alive, and seated by her side in a palm grove\r\nof Peru, listening to the voice of the campanero, or sweet bell-bird\r\nof Brazil.  The deep slumber that follows long hours of mental and\r\nbodily suffering had fallen upon her.\r\n\r\nThe poor man wept and kissed her tenderly, but at that moment the\r\nmate, George Carpinger, entered, and roughly ordered him to come\r\nforward to the capstan head, where he and his comrades were\r\ndeliberating on what was to be done next.\r\n\r\nHeer Van Estell assured himself that his pistols were still in his\r\npocket, that they were primed and loaded, and then he obeyed.  As\r\nthese nine men stood round the capstan, they resembled spectres\r\nrather than human beings, when the cold lustre of the moon fell on\r\ntheir pallid visages and bloodshot eyes that glared wildly from out\r\ntheir sunken sockets.\r\n\r\nEleven persons were still on board, namely, the Heer, his wife and\r\nservant, the mate, and seven seamen; it was evident that one must be\r\nsacrificed to prolong the existence of the rest, and mentally they\r\nresolved that whoever became the victim, should be cooked, lest the\r\nflesh might sicken them again......\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVIII.\r\n\r\nTHE FATAL VOYAGE--HOW THEY CAST LOTS.\r\n\r\n\"I am aware,\" says the author of _Antonina_, \"of the tendency in some\r\nreaders to denounce truth itself as improbable, unless their own\r\npersonal experience has borne witness to it.\"  In this spirit, some\r\nmay denounce the fatalities of the Heer's voyage as improbabilities,\r\nthough the hideous circumstance of human beings in extremity of\r\nhunger destroying each other for food, has been too well and too\r\nterribly established in many instances--such as the wreck of the\r\nFrench frigate _Medusa_; when the British frigate _Nautilus_ was lost\r\non a solitary rock in the Mediterranean; during the famine on board\r\nthe American ship _Peggy_; and on many other occasions.\r\n\r\nBut to resume our little quarto.\r\n\r\nThe mate conducted the Heer Van Estell to the capstan, where the\r\nstarving seamen stood in a silent group, and then he informed him in\r\na hoarse whisper--\r\n\r\n\"That unless they contrived a means of furnishing themselves with\r\nfood, they must all die of starvation; it was impossible for them to\r\nsubsist for another day.  That there were eleven persons on board,\r\nand they had come to the resolution of determining by lot who should\r\ndie that the rest might live.\"\r\n\r\n\"_Eleven_ on board!\" reiterated the Heer, faintly, for his poor wife\r\nGrudule was one of these.\r\n\r\n\"Eleven,\" added a seaman named Adrian Crudelius, with a wild glare in\r\nhis eye; \"if one dies, ten may live.  Bring your wife on deck, sir;\r\nshe must take her chance with the rest.  There must be no distinction\r\nhere.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nay,\" said George Carpinger, \"we may excuse her presence, and so\r\nspare her some of this horror; but her husband shall draw for her.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sirs,\" replied the poor Heer, \"I thank you.  Even here she finds the\r\nprivileges of her sex accorded her.\"\r\n\r\nThen with tremulous hands the mate tore a sheet of paper into eleven\r\npieces, and numbered them from _one_ to _eleven_.  He folded and\r\nplaced them in his hat.  It was then agreed that he who drew number\r\n_one_ was to die, and that he who drew number _two_ was to be the\r\nexecutioner.  After shaking the fatal pieces of paper, amid a silence\r\nthat was awful--the silence of horror--for food or want, death or\r\nlife, were on the issue, every glassy eye was fixed, each nether jaw\r\nrelaxed, while with hot and feverish hands that trembled, they drew\r\nforth their lots--the Heer taking two in succession.  He opened them\r\nhastily, smote his forehead, uttered a wailing cry, and reeled\r\nagainst the capstan.\r\n\r\nHe had drawn numbers \"one\" and \"two,\" so it was the lot of him to\r\ndie, and by the hand of Grudule, or _vice versâ_!\r\n\r\nThe unhappy seamen had scarcely foreseen a chance so terrible as\r\nthis.  Carpinger urged that the wife should be spared, or that lots\r\nshould be cast once more; but those who by risking their fate had\r\nescaped death, were loth to tempt it again, and with sullen murmurs\r\ndeclined.  Propping himself against the capstan, the unfortunate Van\r\nEstell summoned all his energies, and thus addressed them:--\r\n\r\n\"My good companions in misery, you have seen our sorrow and despair\r\nfor the loss of our dear little children; and though I know that\r\ndeath would be a relief and refuge to my poor Grudule, neither she\r\nnor I can perish by the other's hand.  Thus I offer myself freely and\r\nwillingly as the victim and sacrifice.  When I am dead, I charge\r\nyou--I pray you be kind unto her.  Conduct her to her friends, her\r\nhome, her country, and be assured that if ever you are happy enough\r\nto see the waters of the Maese, and the old spires of Rotterdam, she\r\nwill have wealth enough to reward you all.  May Heaven bless you!\r\nGudule, farewell--my poor Gudule!\"\r\n\r\nAt these words he drew a pistol from his pocket, shot himself through\r\nthe head, and fell flat on the deck.  Some appeared stunned by the\r\nwhole affair, but two threw themselves upon the yet quivering body\r\nlike wild animals, and sucked up the blood that oozed from it.\r\n\r\nIn the weird light of the moon, that bloody deck, that silent group\r\nand fallen corpse, presented an awful scene to Gudule Van Estell, who\r\ntottered from her cabin, being roused by the sound of the pistol; but\r\nnow Carpinger the mate, Adrian Crudelius, and her old nurse, bore her\r\nback into the cabin, and fastened the door to prevent her seeing the\r\ndreadful scene that was sure to ensue, when the famished men, in\r\ntheir voracity and fury, almost tore the clothes from the body of the\r\nHeer, being rendered more mad than ever by the contents of a single\r\ncase-bottle of Geneva which had been discovered.  They hewed the body\r\nto pieces, cast its head into the sea, and again the horrible repast\r\ncommenced--a repast which rendered two raving mad, for with loud\r\nyells they sprang overboard and disappeared.\r\n\r\nAll the rest became insane, save the mate and Adrian Crudelius, who\r\nendeavoured to control their extravagance.  One proposed to scuttle\r\nthe ship, or set her on fire, that all might perish together; another\r\nraved and blasphemed Heaven for withholding the wind; a third\r\ndenounced the craft as being under a spell, and thus fixed to one\r\npart of the sea, from whence she would never stir till her timbers\r\nrotted and her planks opened; and all, save the mate, were unanimous\r\nthat next time the wife of the Heer, upon whom one of the lots had\r\nfallen, should perish for their sustenance if a sail came not in\r\nsight.\r\n\r\nThat day passed as others had done; the glassy sea without a ripple,\r\nthe hot sun overhead, the sails flapping against the masts; the\r\nbanner of the Seven Provinces, inverted as a sign of distress,\r\nhanging listlessly downward from the gaff-peak; the sky without a\r\ncloud, the horizon without a sail, and the hearts of the cannibals on\r\nboard the _De Ruyter_ without hope!\r\n\r\nGudule Van Estell was still surviving.  The kind mate had caught a\r\ncouple of mice; these he gave to the nurse, who cooked them in secret\r\nfor her mistress and herself.  But now, towards evening, four of the\r\ncrew, who were bereft of reason, approached her cabin door, and were\r\nattempting to force it open, for the purpose of dragging her to the\r\ncapstan head, when George Carpinger, armed with a cutlass, rushed\r\nforward, and drove them back.\r\n\r\nThey soon procured arms, and howling like wild animals, attacked him,\r\nstaggering the while like drunken men with weakness.  Crudelius now\r\njoined the mate, and there ensued a conflict in which two were slain,\r\nand their bodies were cast overboard by the survivors, who were\r\nalready so glutted by their horrible food as to have no desire for\r\nmore.\r\n\r\nBy the noon of the next day, all had perished by exhaustion, save the\r\nmate and the Dame Van Estell.\r\n\r\nNight was coming on, and the poor solitary seaman was sitting on the\r\nwindlass in a species of stupor, when an unusual coolness in the\r\natmosphere roused his attention, and, with a sailor's instinct, he\r\nfelt the coming breeze.\r\n\r\nFirst there came a gentle catspaw upon the darkening water, then a\r\nripple, and now a whitening of the wave-tops at a distance.  He\r\nstretched his tremulous hands towards them, and wept in joy!\r\n\r\nAnon, clouds came banking up in dense masses to leeward, and\r\nrain--blessed rain! began to fall, while the wind of heaven blew the\r\nlong neglected rigging out in bands, and filled the flapping sails.\r\n\r\nA brace of lazy gulls suddenly appeared wheeling about; and a bird--a\r\nland bird--perched on the end of the studding-sail boom alongside.\r\n\r\nThe haggard eyes of Carpinger swept the horizon, and saw afar off a\r\nspark, which he at first supposed to be a star, but, ere long,\r\ndiscovered to be a light; yet whether it shone on board of a ship, or\r\non the shore, he knew not; so he lashed the helm, and rushing to the\r\nlifts and braces, strove to trim the sails and shape the vessel's\r\ncourse towards it.\r\n\r\nThe bunting began to shake at the gaff-peak; ere long it floated out\r\nupon the wind, while a wake whitened astern, a bubble rose under the\r\nbows, and the _De Ruyter_ walked through the water as of yore.\r\n\r\nThe breeze continued, and next morning she was close in upon a bleak,\r\nrugged, and mountainous coast, which proved to be the Lizard Point in\r\nCornwall, the most southern promontory of England.*\r\n\r\n\r\n* It must be borne in mind that the mouth of the Channel was less\r\nfrequented by shipping in 1670, than now.\r\n\r\n\r\nGeorge Carpinger had the Dame Van Estell conveyed ashore in the\r\nstern-boat, together with a casket of valuable jewels; and the _De\r\nRuyter_, after drifting about the coast, escaping the Cornish\r\nwreckers, who deemed a wreck \"a Godsend,\" was taken into Plymouth and\r\nsold.  Gudule Van Estell was afterwards conveyed to Rotterdam, where\r\nshe found herself one of the wealthiest widows in the city; and as a\r\nreward to George Carpinger for defending her life so valiantly in the\r\nfated _De Ruyter_, she bestowed her hand and guilders upon him.\r\n\r\n\"They lived long and happily together; and he died Burgomaster of\r\nRotterdam in 1720, when Anne was Queen of Britain.\"\r\n\r\n------------\r\n\r\n\"So ends this story,\" said I.\r\n\r\nHartly filled his glass of grog, and emptied it in silence.\r\n\r\nThen I could perceive that the perusal of the history of this fatal\r\nvoyage had a most unpleasant effect upon all who heard it, for\r\nReeves, Hartly, and Hans Peterkin, frequently recurred to it\r\nafterwards.\r\n\r\n\"That little black pamphlet came from a wrecked ship,\" said Hartly,\r\none day--\"'a fated craft'--I can't help wishing you had never brought\r\nit on board, Jack.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why?\" I asked.\r\n\r\n\"It is such a devil of a horse-marine yarn about these Dutchmen\r\neating each other.\"\r\n\r\n\"How?\"\r\n\r\n\"I always think about it.\"\r\n\r\n\"I can easily put it out of existence by stuffing it under a kettle\r\nin the cook's galley; it may aid Cuffy in cooking the dinner.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, no,\" said he, hastily, \"that would be worse.\"\r\n\r\n\"In what way?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know,\" said he, thoughtfully; \"but such things are like the\r\nFlying Dutchman's letters, which must neither be taken or refused\r\nwhen the wind blows them on board.\"\r\n\r\nSome days after this, Hartly lost his ring--the ring given him by old\r\nMother Jensdochter--the amulet which, until that moment, he had never\r\nbeen without.  It was torn from his hand while assisting to haul the\r\nmaintack on board, and dropped over the gunnel.\r\n\r\nThis trivial event, and the story of the _De Ruyter_, together with\r\nthe past evils of our voyage, affected Hartly and Reeves more\r\nseriously than I could have imagined.  From the cabin, Cuffy Snowball\r\nsoon carried the vague fears forward among the seamen.  Hans Peterkin\r\nbegan to shake his white head ominously, for old mariners have, they\r\nknow not why or how, strange instincts and presentiments; so our\r\ncrew, without any just reason, became more than usually solicitous\r\nabout their duties, and anxious for the termination of the voyage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIX.\r\n\r\nADVENTURE WITH A WHALE.\r\n\r\nNext day the wind veered due west, and we trimmed the _Leda_, to lie\r\nclose to it, making long tacks to the southward, as we had been\r\ndriven so far to the north-east.\r\n\r\nHartly and I were leaning over the weather-quarter, chatting and\r\ngazing listlessly at the white water that bubbled like a flooded\r\nmill-race under the brig's counter, while Mother Cary's chickens came\r\ntripping lightly after us, when suddenly a huge whale (like a ship's\r\nhull, bottom uppermost) rose from the waves close by us, with the\r\nwater pouring in torrents from its dusky and shining sides.  Its\r\nappearance was so sudden and alarming, that I started back; but\r\nHartly laughed, saying,\r\n\r\n\"Don't mind him, Jack; he is not coming on board.\"\r\n\r\nFor a full minute he floated in the water, keeping pace with the\r\nbrig, to the great admiration of our old Orkney whaleman, Hans, and\r\nthen sank slowly down--down far below.  We could see his vast bulk\r\nshining as he passed _under_ us, and came up on our other side, so\r\nclose that he almost grazed the copper of the _Leda_.\r\n\r\nThis monster of the deep was nearly as large, at least as long, as\r\nthe brig, and his aspect was calculated to inspire awe in those who\r\nwere less familiar than we now were with the denizens of the sea.\r\n\r\nHe was a common whale, and the head being, as usual, out of all\r\nproportion, was one-third the entire size of the fish, while the eyes\r\nwere no larger than those of an ox.  The smooth and slippery skin,\r\nfrom which the foam dripped, was mottled; and it--or _he_, as we\r\nnamed him--swam not as whales generally do, _against_ the wind, but\r\nwith us.\r\n\r\nOur friend was evidently in a playful mood, as he repeatedly rose and\r\nsank, plunged and surged up on each side of the _Leda_ alternately,\r\nand twice grazed our rudder.\r\n\r\n\"He smells the blubber and sealskins aboard, sir,\" said Hans\r\nPeterkin, \"and they make him frolicsome, you see.\"\r\n\r\n\"Look out, sir!\" added Reeves, who was in the mainchains; \"by Jove,\r\nhe'll be foul of us in his next gambol!\"\r\n\r\n\"And we may have our rudder unshipped--I don't like this at all,\"\r\nreplied Hartly.  \"Cuffy, bring me a sealing-gun, with powder and a\r\nhandful of slugs.\"\r\n\r\nIn half a minute Hartly stood in the boat at the stern davits, with\r\nthe long gun loaded and charged with ten square junks of lead, each\r\nlarger than a rifle ball.  Then, just as the whale, for the fifth or\r\nsixth time rose under the stern, he fired.\r\n\r\nThe whole charge entered one of the great spiracles, or blow-holes,\r\nwhich are situated in the middle of the head, about sixteen feet from\r\nthe nose, and through which this fish can spout to a vast height when\r\nwounded or annoyed.  The moment the gun was fired, our whale sunk\r\nlike a stone.\r\n\r\n\"There he goes, for ever I hope!\" cried Hartly.\r\n\r\n\"We have not seen the last of him, sir,\" said old Hans, as he got\r\nastride the boom of the fore-and-aft mainsail in his excitement to\r\nsee the whale again; \"he has a long way to go _down_, before he'll\r\ncome up again.  Why, Lord love you, sir, I have known them in the\r\nsound of Yell, when struck by a harpoon, descend head-foremost for\r\neight hundred fathoms, (at the rate of eight knots an hour, till the\r\nline in the bowpost smoked, ay, blazed with friction,) and then come\r\nup with their jawbones broken, by running foul of a rock at the\r\nbottom.  That one has gone down fully four hundred fathoms.\"\r\n\r\n\"How do you know, Hans?\"\r\n\r\n\"By the eddy--he'll be up to _blow_, directly.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where?\" said I.\r\n\r\n\"On our weather beam, I think.  See! there are the bubbles of his\r\nblowing already!\"\r\n\r\nHans was right; even while he spoke, the whale rose to the surface,\r\nabout fifty yards from us, and from his blow-holes shot a vast spout\r\nof water streaked with blood into the air, and then it pattered like\r\nrain as it fell into the sea.  After lashing the water furiously with\r\nhis tail till it boiled in foam around him, and the air above became\r\nfilled with vapour, he threw himself into a _perpendicular_ position,\r\nand stood for a moment like a pillar, from the sea.\r\n\r\nIt was a strange and exciting scene!\r\n\r\nHe now flapped his mighty flukes, which were perhaps thirty feet\r\napart, till they cracked like a gigantic whip, and then sank from our\r\ngaze in a deep eddy, around which the concentric waves heaved and\r\nbroke for a considerable time; but we saw him no more.\r\n\r\n\"Well, Hans,\" said I, \"how do you like this adventure?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not much, Master Manly,\" replied the old Scotsman, shaking his white\r\nhairs; \"'cause you see, sir, when a whale takes to dancing about on\r\nhis nose in this fashion, after lashing the water with his flukes, a\r\n_storm_ is sure to follow.  A whale knows better than a human\r\ncreature when a close-reefed topsail breeze is coming, by a pricking\r\npain that comes over their bodies, and so, after dancing about as\r\nthat fellow did, they run right away from that quarter of the sea to\r\nanother.  I have known o' this many times, when I was a wee bairn at\r\nhome in Whalsoe.  I'll stake a trifle we have our topgallant yards on\r\ndeck before the sun sets.\"\r\n\r\nAnd old Hans proved correct.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXX.\r\n\r\nLOSS OF THE \"LEDA.\"\r\n\r\nOn the night after our adventure with the whale I had turned in to\r\nbed betimes; but was roused about two in the morning by the noise\r\nmade by Hammer, our carpenter, Cuffy Snowball, and others battening\r\nthe deadlights of the stern windows.  At the same moment I became\r\nsensible of the unusual motion of the vessel, of the tremendous din\r\nthat reigned on deck, and of the furious manner in which my cot, the\r\nbrass cabin lamp, and the tell-tale compass swung about.\r\n\r\n\"What is the matter?\" I asked, starting up, while the prophecy of\r\nHans flashed on my memory.\r\n\r\n\"Matter, sir! faith, if you were on deck you would soon find out!\"\r\nwas the somewhat impatient response of Tom Hammer, who was drenched\r\nto the skin.\r\n\r\n\"Is it blowing hard?\" said I.\r\n\r\n\"'Twill nebber blow harder, Massa Tanly, till him blows himself right\r\nout,\" grinned Cuffy Snowball.\r\n\r\n\"A regular hurricane! the brig is almost under bare poles, and we\r\nsound the pumps every half-hour,\" added Hammer, who seemed indignant\r\nat the soundness of my past slumber.\r\n\r\nOn hearing all this, I leaped out, dressed myself, and hurried on\r\ndeck.\r\n\r\nA wild gale, in short, a tempest, was roaring through the rigging and\r\nstraining the shrouds of the _Leda_; she lurched and pitched heavily,\r\nas she rushed through mountains of seething foam; for amid the black\r\nobscurity on all sides we could see its whiteness, and the snowy\r\nsurf, which was torn by the wind from the wave-crests, and swept,\r\nlike smoke, along the sea.\r\n\r\nThe brig was driving right before the wind, under a foresail,\r\nforetopsail, and fore and aft mainsail, all closely reefed.\r\nEverything was done that might render her snug.  The deadlights had\r\nbarely been shipped before she was struck by a wave which buried her\r\nin the black trough of the sea--tore her stern-boat from the iron\r\ndavits, and swept it away like a leaf shred from a twig.\r\n\r\nHans and Paul Reeves were at the wheel.  Hartly stood by them pale\r\nand excited, as I could perceive by the glimmering lights of the\r\nbinnacle.  All hands were on deck, and muffled in their glazed\r\nstorm-jackets and dripping sou'-westers, so they seemed as drenched\r\nas if they had come up from the bottom of the sea.\r\n\r\n\"Take care of yourself, Jack--take care!\" cried my friend; \"every sea\r\nshe ships sweeps something off the deck, and we have already lost one\r\nman from the fore-yardarm.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good Heavens--when?\"\r\n\r\n\"About an hour ago--poor Bill Bradley!\"\r\n\r\nI grasped one of the mainshrouds, for the deck was so slippery, the\r\ngusts of wind so fierce, and the force of the seas, which broke ever\r\nand anon across the brig, so overwhelming, that I could never have\r\nkept afoot for a moment without some support.\r\n\r\nOn, on careered the _Leda_, through wind and waves--on through\r\nwhitening foam and tossing wrack--on through drenching rain,\r\ndarkness, and obscurity, with the storm roaring and whistling amid\r\nher straining spars and rigging, while she groaned in every timber,\r\nand seemed to quiver to her backbone, as the ponderous waves pursued\r\nand burst upon her.\r\n\r\nOnce or twice the gloom around us was varied by sheets of lightning\r\nwhich gleamed luridly at the far horizon; and then for an instant the\r\nblack waves seemed to be washing _against_ the reddened sky.\r\nElsewhere to the northward, when the black flying scud was torn\r\nasunder in heaven, we saw the long flickering rods of the \"merry\r\ndancers\" playing athwart the sky.  Then the crape-like rent would\r\nclose, and all again became pitchy darkness.  The sea which tore away\r\nour quarter-boat had started the sternpost.  Tom Hammer and his mates\r\nrushed to sound the pumps, and reported that \"the water in the well\r\nhad risen _four feet_!\"\r\n\r\nHoarse orders were bellowed by Hartly through his trumpet, and the\r\nclank of the pumps rang incessantly, for it was evident she had\r\nsprung a leak somewhere aft, the _clear_ water having replaced the\r\nbilge; so a fresh gang was required every quarter of an hour.  Here\r\nwas a place in which I could make myself useful, and take my \"spell\"\r\nwith the rest; and where, though the dread of perishing was strong in\r\nmy heart, I worked hard but mechanically, like one in a terrible\r\ndream.\r\n\r\nHammer, with all the hands that could be spared from the deck,\r\nhurried below, but soon reappeared, to announce--why I know not--that\r\nto get at the leak was impossible!\r\n\r\n\"Do we gain upon her?\" was the constant question of those who toiled\r\nat the pumps; but Hammer was too full of hopelessness to reply; so\r\nfor hours the monotonous clanking went on, till the chains and\r\nleathers of the pumps became almost useless, and then the water rose\r\nrapidly in both the fore and after hold!\r\n\r\nWe threw our large anchors and carronades overboard to lighten her by\r\nthe head; but without much avail.  Pale and composed--resolute yet\r\nanxious--poor Hartly had stood by the pumps, encouraging us by his\r\nvoice and example.  He was, however, sad and gloomy.  That the loss\r\nof his _ring_ affected him was evident.  How strong and yet how weak\r\nis the mind of man!\r\n\r\nThe water continued to rise rapidly, though we toiled till our knees\r\nand arms ached; grey dawn began to brighten in the east, but there\r\nwas no symptom of the storm abating.\r\n\r\n\"If she ships one sea more, such as that which struck our quarter,\"\r\nsaid Hartly, \"she will founder!\"\r\n\r\nThe words were scarcely uttered, when a mighty mountain of black\r\nwater reared up like an arching cliff, fringed by foam, came hissing\r\nand roaring towards us, and burst in thundering volume on our decks,\r\nsweeping poor Tom Hammer the carpenter, another seaman, and all the\r\nspare booms, spars, buckets, and everything that previous waves had\r\nleft, overboard--starting the longboat from its lashings, and dashing\r\nit with such violence against the larboard bulwarks, that a vast\r\nbreach was made in them.  The gang at the pumps were all tumbled in a\r\nheap into the starboard scuppers, and returned to their work with\r\ndifficulty.  The iron sling of the mainyard gave way at the same\r\nmoment, and the spar with the handed sail fell heavily with all their\r\ngear into the sea.\r\n\r\nUnder this shock the Leda literally _stood still_, as if paralysed in\r\nher forward progress.\r\n\r\nAnother fatal volume burst upon her quarter, and _then_, alas! she\r\nbegan to settle down into the trough of the sea.  She had lost all\r\nher buoyancy and was sinking!  Her rudder was torn away--the stern\r\nframe shattered, and so she filled with perilous rapidity.\r\n\r\n\"Clear away the longboat, Reeves--unship the compass in the\r\nbinnacle,\" ordered Hartly; \"Hans, get up a beaker of water, a bag of\r\nbread--in oars and blankets--we must quit instantly and shove off!\"\r\n\r\n\"In such a sea as this?\" asked Reeves, with wildness in his eye, as\r\nhe clung to a belaying pin.  \"No boat can live----\"\r\n\r\n\"Ay, Paul, even in such a sea as this; we must quit the ship, or sink\r\nwith her.  Stand by, my lads, and throw her head to the wind.\"\r\n\r\n\"The foremast will go like a reed--but see--the wind has already done\r\nwhat you wish.\"\r\n\r\nThe loss of her rudder had rendered the _Leda_ (her chain plates were\r\nnow in the water) unmanageable, but, with the promptitude and\r\ndecision of brave and desperate hearts, some of our men hurried to\r\nthe braces, to strive and keep the vessel's head to windward, while\r\nothers got the longboat cleared of all that endless _débris_ and\r\nrubbish which usually accumulate there during a voyage--launched it,\r\nand by fending, with no small exertion of skill and strength,\r\nprevented it from being dashed to pieces against the side of the\r\nfoundering _Leda_.  A cask of water was thrown in, also the binnacle\r\ncompass, which, unfortunately, was broken during the confusion.  The\r\noars were luckily lashed to the thwarts; the mast, yard, sail, and\r\nrudder were also there, and we prepared at once to leave.\r\n\r\nWild though the wind, the atmosphere was dense and full of vapour and\r\nobscurity; the mingled rain and surf were so blinding, that one could\r\nscarcely see one's hand outstretched at arm's length.  To keep our\r\nfeet in such a howling tempest was almost impossible; thus in passing\r\nforward or aft, we were obliged to drag ourselves along by clutching\r\nbelaying pins, cleats, and ring-bolts, while many of us were severely\r\ninjured by pieces of broken wreck that floated about the deck, and\r\nwere dashed to and fro by the waves.\r\n\r\nTwo or three of our men were stunned, and on falling overboard were\r\nseen no more; but in less than three minutes after the longboat was\r\nlaunched, we had all left the ship--Hartly being the last to do\r\nso--and to the number of fourteen in all (including Paul Reeves, Hans\r\nPeterkin, Cuffy Snowball, and me), committed ourselves to the mercy\r\nof the sea and storm, in that small craft, which was tossed like a\r\ncork upon the billows.\r\n\r\nFor a time the boat was rasped so furiously against the side of the\r\nbrig, that all our united strength was requisite to get under her\r\nshattered stern, and fairly shove off.  We worked in silence--the\r\nsilence of black desperation!\r\n\r\nBut on falling astern of the sinking brig, the boat became exposed\r\nstill more to the fury of the sea.\r\n\r\n\"Pull her round,\" cried Hartly; \"keep her bow to the break of the\r\nsea, or we shall be swamped.  Pull to windward of the _Leda_!\"\r\n\r\nAs we did so, a single wave nearly filled the boat, and we had\r\nnothing for it but to bear away before the roaring blast.\r\n\r\nThrough the black drift we could see the brig, from which we were\r\nonly a few yards distant, sinking deeper and deeper; at last the\r\nwaves rolled in fierce tumult over her deck; still not a word escaped\r\nus.  Our hearts were too full for utterance; but a pang of sorrow and\r\ndismay thrilled them when the poor little _Leda_, with her masts\r\nstill standing, went down into the waste of waters and disappeared\r\nfor ever!\r\n\r\nHartly now took off his sou'-wester, and briefly told us \"to be of\r\ngood heart, for God would be sure to protect us.\"\r\n\r\nAll present untied and took off their hats, and listened to him in\r\nsilence, though he could scarcely be heard amid the wild fury of the\r\ngale.  Then Paul Reeves, who pulled the bow oar, shouted--\r\n\r\n\"Three cheers, my lads, for our captain!\"\r\n\r\nAnd they gave them with all the heartier will that he was now as poor\r\nas themselves, for all that Hartly possessed in the world had gone\r\ndown with the _Leda_, as she was not insured.  To keep the boat from\r\nbeing swamped, with incredible difficulty we now stepped her mast,\r\nhoisted a little of the sail, and bore away before the wind; but when\r\nwe were in the _trough_ of the sea, it flapped against the mast, and\r\nthe next instant, when we rode on the _summit_ of a wave, the wind\r\nalmost tore it to shreds.  Then the wild water bubbled over her\r\nstern, often immersing the steersman to his ears, and obliging us\r\nincessantly to bale with our hats; but the increasing light of dawn,\r\nand an evidence of some abatement in the tempest, encouraged us to\r\npersevere in our efforts to save our lives; and so we struggled\r\nmanfully with the warring elements.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXI.\r\n\r\nTHE CRY.\r\n\r\nThe wind and sea went down together as day brightened on the\r\ncheerless scene.  After the night we had passed, how grimly pale and\r\nwan our faces seemed in the cold grey dawn of morning!\r\n\r\nThis catastrophe occurred in the middle of May, when we were about\r\nthree hundred miles from St. John, our destination.  Our compass was\r\nbroken, but we continued to steer south-west and by west, as well as\r\nwe could determine.\r\n\r\nThe gale having abated, we hoisted the sail to the masthead, shipped\r\nour oars, and after receiving about a tablespoonful of rum per man,\r\nendeavoured to make the best of our way towards Newfoundland, in the\r\nhope of being picked up, ere long, by one of the many outward or\r\nhomeward bound traders.\r\n\r\nWhen day was fully in, we swept the sea with anxious eyes, but not a\r\nsail was visible!\r\n\r\nCast thus helplessly on the wide ocean, with a few biscuits, a small\r\nbeaker of fresh water, and a gallon keg of rum, at a distance of\r\nthree hundred miles from land, our prospects were gloomy in the\r\nextreme; and amid them all, the horrible story of the _De Ruyter_,\r\nand similar miseries endured by those of whom I had heard and read in\r\nsuch situations, haunted me.\r\n\r\nExertion warmed us: we now got our clothing wrung out and dried, the\r\nboat thoroughly baled, and by midday we were as comfortable as men so\r\ncircumstanced might be.  Cuffy, who had saved his violin, the only\r\narticle of property he ever possessed, now proceeded to enliven us,\r\nas he had often done before, by singing a negro melody, to his own\r\naccompaniment; yet this was but ghastly mirth at best.\r\n\r\nOur biscuits being soaked by the brine, excited a thirst which we\r\nwere without the means of allaying.  Moreover, the _idea_ of being\r\nupon allowance in itself excites a thirsty craving; thus by the noon\r\nof the second day, the water in the beaker was nearly consumed, and\r\nwe had no hope now but for rain.\r\n\r\nI believe some hours elapsed before we were fully aware, or had\r\nrealized a true sense of our dreadful situation.\r\n\r\nHow shall I describe the days that passed--and how the nights?\r\nMorning after morning only dawned to raise our hopes of success; and\r\nthese faded as the day wore on; and then the nights were dark\r\nmonotonous hours of bitterness and despair.\r\n\r\nYet they were the short nights of May; and it must be borne in mind\r\nthat however warm they are upon the land, and in more temperate\r\nlatitudes, they were cold and chilly when passed in an open boat,\r\nupon the mighty Atlantic.  The evening of the fourth day deepened,\r\nand still not a sail was in sight.  About nine o'clock, one of our\r\nforlorn party, whose clothing was thinner than the rest, and who had\r\nsuffered much from hunger and exposure, died in the bottom of the\r\nboat, and we silently committed his body to the deep.\r\n\r\nThere were neither prayer nor funeral service, but we all stood up,\r\nand uncovered our heads, while Hans and a seaman launched the poor\r\nfellow into the sea.\r\n\r\nOur last drop of water was now expended, for it had been poured\r\nbetween the parched lips of this sufferer, in vain.\r\n\r\nOur bread we dared scarcely eat, even in the morsels in which it was\r\ndoled out, lest it might excite that awful thirst which we had no\r\nliquid to assuage, and which the summer sun, when blazing over our\r\nheads at noon, rendered worse by a thousand degrees, making us long\r\nfor night, when the moist dew would fall on our parched lips and arid\r\nvisages; then night made us long for day, in the hope of seeing a\r\nsail, as we were in terror lest one should pass us unseen; and I am\r\nassured that more than one must have done so.\r\n\r\nAmid his own bodily misery, poor Hartly frequently reproached himself\r\nfor having, as he said, \"lured me from a quiet occupation into a\r\ncareer so fatal and disastrous.\"\r\n\r\nThe older seamen sought to encourage us by relating how often they\r\nhad been wrecked, and yet had escaped death.\r\n\r\n\"I remember,\" said Hans Peterkin, \"when the _Brenda_, a bark of\r\nKirkwall, was wrecked on her voyage from Jamaica.  The night was\r\nrough, and we were under close-reefed topsails, when a sea struck\r\nher, and unshipped her rudder, just as she sprang a leak.  All hands\r\nwere ordered to the pumps, and to the thrumming of a sail; but the\r\nloss of the rudder hove her dead in the wind's eye, so her mainmast\r\nwent by the board, bringing with it the fore and mizen topmasts,\r\nmaking her a useless wreck in a moment.  I was washed overboard; but\r\nthere was no time to look after me, so I rode on the mainmast all\r\nnight.  When day broke there was no ship to be seen--she must have\r\nfoundered in the dark.  Three days and two nights I rode upon that\r\nshattered mast, till a Spanish schooner, bound for Rio, picked me up;\r\nyet I never lost heart, shipmates, for I knew I should be saved.\"\r\n\r\n\"How?\" said Reeves.\r\n\r\n\"Because we have a saying among us in Orkney, that he who eats of the\r\ndulse of Guiodin,* and drinks of the well of Kildingie, will escape\r\neverything but the _Black Death_; and many a time I have eaten of one\r\nand drunk of the other.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n* The creek of Odin, in Stronza.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the fifth day another man died, and was committed to the deep.  No\r\none stood up this time, we were becoming either too weak or too\r\ncallous.\r\n\r\n\"Water--water,\" sighed Paul Reeves; \"when ashore, I will never drink\r\naught but pure spring water again.\"\r\n\r\n\"Bide ye, messmate, and dinna gut a swimming fish; or, as we say in\r\nOrkney, cut up nae herrings till ye have them in your net.  When you\r\nare ashore!--ashore indeed--when shall we ever see the shore?\"\r\n\r\nEven the strong mind of the hardy Hans was wandering now.  The wind\r\nkept tolerably fair, and though by alternate spells at the oars we\r\ntoiled day and night to add to the speed of our sail, we had no means\r\nof ascertaining the distance we ran; and now the pangs of hunger were\r\nalternately maddening or paralyzing, but they were trivial when\r\ncompared with those of thirst.  By skilfully striking with his oar,\r\nHans contrived to kill four petrels when they came tripping by close\r\nto our boat.  Since the days of Clusius and Pliny, tradition has\r\nfoolishly made these poor birds the precursors of a storm; but the\r\nelements had done their worst upon us, so we cared not.  They were\r\nsoon plucked and demolished.\r\n\r\nWe found them very fat and nutritious, as the whole genus of petrels\r\nhave a singular facility for creating and for spouting pure oil from\r\ntheir bills in defence of themselves and their eggs if molested; and\r\nof this oil they can produce plenty, as they feed on blubber and\r\nfish.  The quantity in them astonished all but Hans Peterkin, who had\r\nbeen wont to harry the nests of the skua, as the petrel is named in\r\nhis native isles, and who told me that whales were often discovered\r\nin the Firth of Westra and the Sound of Yell by the flocks that\r\nfollowed in the hope of a gorge of blubber.\r\n\r\n\"My father was drowned by a _skua_,\" said he.\r\n\r\n\"Drowned--how, by a skua?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ay, for so they called the petrels in Orkney once, and so they call\r\nthem in Faroe now.\"\r\n\r\n\"But how was he drowned?\" asked Hartly.\r\n\r\n\"He was a bold fellow who could climb the steep rocks that overhung\r\nthe most furious sea, to get eggs and catch the petrels _asleep_ if\r\npossible; for the skua or fulmar supply us with feathers for our\r\nbeds, medicine in illness, and oil for our lamps.  My mother used to\r\nmake the whole bird a candle by passing through its mouth a wick,\r\nwhich the fat of the body fed.  My father, Magnus Peterkin, was, I\r\nhave said, a bold fellow, though he wore a _glain neidr_, or\r\nadder-gem, an old amulet of the Druid days, and believed that while\r\nit hung at his neck he was safe.  On a stormy night he swung himself\r\nover a rock in Pomona to pull some petrels out of their holes, but\r\none squirted a billful of salt oil right into his eyes---just as I\r\nmight a quid--which so confused him, that he quitted hold of the\r\nrope, fell upon the rocks three hundred feet below, and perished\r\nmiserably--poor man!\"\r\n\r\nThe fifth night was calm and beautiful--too calm for us, as the wind\r\nhad almost died away, and a clear moonlight was shining on the silent\r\nsea, when a singular and startling event occurred--one that filled us\r\nwith vague terror and awe.\r\n\r\nSix of us, faint, worn, and half-asleep, were tugging monotonously at\r\nour oars; four slept in the bottom of the boat, and Reeves was\r\nsteering by a star, while honest Cuffy Snowball, whose native\r\ngood-humour and cheerfulness even the horrors of our situation could\r\nnot repress, was playing sweetly on his violin, and, to keep our\r\nspirits from sinking, sang a negro song which he had picked up during\r\nthe years of his slavery in South Carolina--and sung it while his\r\ntongue clove to the roof of his mouth with thirst.  I leave the\r\nreader to judge how in such a time and place the soft melody and\r\ngrotesque pathos of a hackneyed popular air sounded in the ears of\r\nthe starving and the dying!\r\n\r\n  \"All round de leetle farm I wandered,\r\n    When I was young;\r\n  Den my 'appy days I squandered,\r\n    Many de songs I sung.\r\n\r\n  \"When I was playing wid my brudder,\r\n    'Appy was I;\r\n  Oh take me to my kind old mudder,\r\n    Dere let me lib and die.\r\n\r\n  \"All the world am sad and dreary,\r\n    Ebberywhere I roam;\r\n  Oh darkies, how my 'art grows weary,\r\n    Far from de old folks at home!\"\r\n\r\n\r\nAlas, it was grotesquely horrible!\r\n\r\nThe calmness of the night, the sickness of my heart, the weakness of\r\nmy limbs, and the sweetness of the violin as its notes floated far\r\nover the moonlit sea, together with the monotonous sound of the oars,\r\nmade me fall into a waking doze--yet I still tugged mechanically on,\r\nthough dreaming.\r\n\r\nAt times I imagined that I was in a dense fog off the harbour mouth\r\nof St. John.  I heard the booming of the fog-guns from the battery on\r\nthe mountains, though they sounded faint and far off.  Then followed\r\nthe welcome voice of the gunner on the low rocky point of Fort\r\nAmherst, challenging as usual--\r\n\r\n\"What ship is that?\"\r\n\r\nI strove to answer as we ran in through the Narrows, but my tongue\r\nrefused its office.\r\n\r\nAgain, I was at my desk, engrossing in giant ledgers, with the\r\nsnorting voice of old Uriah Skrew grating on my ear.  Anon I was in\r\nmy father's rose-covered villa at Peckham--in London, amid the roar\r\nand gaiety of its streets--its evening bustle and lights--in the\r\ntheatre--at the opera--galloping out of town on the Derby-day.  Then\r\nI was in a silent forest--but lo!\r\n\r\nMy dreams were broken by a shriek which made us all start as if\r\nelectrified--the oarsmen at the oars, the sleepers at the bottom of\r\nthe boat.  Cuffy dropped his violin, and Reeves his tiller, as we all\r\nsprang up, looked in each other's sunken eyes, and on the glassy sea,\r\nthat rippled in flat immensity far away in the moonlight.\r\n\r\n\"What is it--where did it come from?\" we all gasped.\r\n\r\nBut none could answer correctly.\r\n\r\n\"It seemed to rise from the sea, far away on the starboard bow,\" said\r\nReeves.\r\n\r\n\"_The starboard bow!_\" repeated Hartly, shuddering.\r\n\r\nWe gazed intently around us, and though one of our men insisted that\r\nhe could see a large figure like that of a man swimming towards us in\r\nthe moonlit water, the rest could discern nothing.\r\n\r\nThis supernatural cry or sound seemed to belong neither to earth nor\r\nheaven; it rent the air and penetrated to our inner hearts; its\r\ncadence, too, was horrible, and unlike anything we had ever heard\r\nbefore.  Its source occasioned us endless surmise, and we never\r\ndiscovered it; but the circumstance affected us all variously, and\r\nfor a time we forgot our thirst, our hunger, and our danger, in the\r\nmystery and vague fear it occasioned.\r\n\r\nThat it could be given, as one surmised, by a drowning seaman who had\r\nescaped from some wreck, was impossible, for under the brilliant moon\r\nof the early May night, the whole sea was visible to us as at\r\nnoonday.  Hans of Orkney declared it to be a spirit of the sea, a\r\nwater-bull, or the ghost of a man, whom we had unwittingly deserted\r\nin the foundering wreck.  Cuffy moaned out that it was a warning from\r\nthe Obi man.  An Irish batman muttered something about a Banshee, but\r\npoor Hartly was too careless now, or too desponding, to suggest\r\nanything, and remained silent.\r\n\r\nI can scarcely conceive that this cry, so strange, so wild and\r\nthrilling--so appalling to those who were in such a solemn and\r\nterrible situation--and which was heard by us all at the same moment,\r\nwas the combined effect of imagination; but whether it was some\r\nphenomenon--a sound brought through the air from a vast distance, by\r\nsome unknown cause--the echo of a crime committed elsewhere, or a\r\njarring of the elements that affected our over-strained organs of\r\nhearing, I know not.\r\n\r\nI merely relate the event as it occurred; but never, while life\r\nremains, shall I forget the bewildering and terrifying effect of that\r\nappalling shriek, when it rang in our ears, across the otherwise\r\nsilent sea on that most mournful night.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXII.\r\n\r\nTHE TWELFTH DAY.\r\n\r\nThe sixth day dawned as the wind freshened and the waning moon went\r\ndown in clouds; it dawned upon an angry sea, a leaden sky, and with a\r\ncold breeze that bore no ship--no hope of release towards us.\r\n\r\nOn, this day two more of our men, who had been lying in a torpid\r\nstate for three hours, died, and were cast overboard.  We were\r\ncompletely callous now.  About eleven in the forenoon, Hans Peterkin,\r\nwho was steering, suddenly uttered a hoarse cry.\r\n\r\n\"See--see!\" he exclaimed, pointing a-head, while glaring with haggard\r\neyes; \"a sail--a sail!  Thanks be to God,\" he added, pulling off his\r\nfur cap, \"we are saved!\"\r\n\r\nWe that were rowing turned, and those who were dozing between the\r\nthwarts sprang up; and there sure enough, hull down about eighteen\r\nmiles off, we saw a large ship under a cloud of dark canvas, which\r\nhad evidently been wet by rain overnight, running close-hauled upon\r\nthe starboard tack, and going with great speed through the water.\r\n\r\nOh the ecstasy of this sight!\r\n\r\nWe trimmed our little sail anew; we hoisted all our neck-ties at the\r\nmast-head, as a signal; we pulled with the strength of\r\nmadmen--madmen, who were dying and despairing--towards her; but she\r\nsaw us not, (I dare not say that her crew _heeded_ not.) Though for a\r\ntime we seemed to gain upon her, the wind freshened so much that she\r\nwas soon out of sight; and once more, after all our prayers, our\r\nlongings, and our joy, we were left alone upon the sullen sea--alone\r\namid emotions too terrible to delineate, for hope and life went with\r\nher!\r\n\r\nSome of our strongest men wrung their hands and wept.  Three days\r\nafter this, those who had restrained the maddening desire to drink of\r\nthe sea, now gave loose to their burning thirst, and heedless of the\r\nappeals of Hartly and the warnings of Peterkin, plunged their wasted\r\nhands in the brine, and drank it in great quantities.\r\n\r\nThe sequel soon followed--a delirium and insanity which rapidly\r\nbecame infectious.\r\n\r\nAll were soon raving.  Hartly talked of his dead wife--of their\r\nlittle ones, and the green churchyard, where they lay under an old\r\nyew-tree; then of his lost ship, and the ring of the Iceland witch.\r\n\r\nHans sang Orkney songs in a guttural dialect--half Scottish and half\r\nNorse; and believed himself to be whaling in the Pentland Firth, and\r\nSound of Yell.  Paul Reeves sat with a serious but fatuous aspect,\r\nwriting an imaginary log with his fingers on the boat-thwart; Cuffy\r\nplayed scraps of negro-melodies on his violin; and believed himself\r\nto be in his caboose, cooking a sumptuous dinner for those in the\r\ncabin.\r\n\r\nSome raved of rich repasts, and with idiot joy enumerated the viands\r\nthat smoked before them, or the cool draughts of spring water that\r\ngurgled over mossy rocks and under broad green leaves in shady\r\nwoods--and of luscious fruit that grew in ripe clusters, but which\r\nthey strove to reach in vain, as, like the gushing spring, it always\r\neluded them.  In pursuit of one of these illusions, poor Hans\r\nPeterkin fell overboard, and, without an effort to save himself, sank\r\nlike a stone.  Alas! the holy well of Kildingie and the blessed dulse\r\nof Guiodin, availed him nothing now!\r\n\r\nAt last we ceased to row, for the strongest among us \"caught crabs\"\r\nfrom time to time, and had the oars twitched out of their hands by\r\nthe sea, for we were helplessly and hopelessly worn out.\r\n\r\nThe haggard features of some became rigid; the black fur of fever\r\ngathered upon their cracked lips; and their wild, sunken, and\r\nblood-shot eyes assumed a snaky glare.  Their wasted forms seemed to\r\ndwindle before me; then they grew and dwindled again like a species\r\nof phantasmagoria, as I sat bewildered and half torpid among them;\r\nthen a lurch of the boat would throw some of them off the thwarts\r\nmotionless and dead!\r\n\r\nOn the _Twelfth_ day after we had abandoned the _Leda_, there\r\nremained in the boat only four alive, including Hartly, Reeves, a\r\nseaman named Jones, and myself.  All the rest had been thrown\r\noverboard in succession as they died--even poor Cuffy Snowball,\r\nclutching his violin to the last.\r\n\r\nIn their delirium some had been very violent--proposing to scuttle\r\nthe boat; others threw the oars overboard and unclasped their knives\r\nto slay their messmates.  One sprang into the sea, with a husky cry,\r\nand ended his miseries at once.\r\n\r\nGrim and fearful as they were, I thought the calm aspect of those who\r\ndied was to be envied.  They seemed so free from every ill and storm\r\nthat might assail them, while those who yet lived and lingered were\r\nthe most helpless of human beings.  I know not why or how it was that\r\nso many strong and hardy men perished, while I survived.\r\n\r\nReeves, Hartly, and Jones the sailor, lay prostrate in the bottom of\r\nthe boat; and at times I knew not whether they were alive or dead,\r\nsave by an occasional spasm that twitched their features, or a\r\nquivering in their limbs.  After a time even these symptoms of\r\nexistence ceased.\r\n\r\nI felt the slumber of long exhaustion stealing over me.  Lest the\r\nboat might capsize in a squall, I remember having just sense and\r\nstrength sufficient to enable me to let go the halyard, and lower the\r\nsail, or rather, let it fall by its own weight, when I sank down in\r\nthe stern sheets, and must have lain there for hours.\r\n\r\nA drizzling rain refreshed me, and when I awoke, the silver moon, was\r\nshining on the sea.\r\n\r\nAnother night had descended upon us!\r\n\r\nI baled out the boat with a hat, for the forms of my passive\r\ncompanions were half-covered by water.  As I did so, I thought Hartly\r\nspoke--at least, that his white and bloodless lips moved; but this\r\nmight be fancy.  My mind was a chaos of gloom, misery, and terrible\r\nforebodings.\r\n\r\nAnxious to learn whether life yet lingered in my friend, or whether I\r\nwas quite alone--the last man--with the dead upon that silent\r\nmidnight sea, I stooped close to Hartly; but at that moment the boat\r\ngave a sudden lurch, which threw me violently among the three bodies.\r\nIn falling, my head struck against one of the thwarts, and happily I\r\nbecame senseless.\r\n\r\n* * * * *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIII.\r\n\r\nWHAT FOLLOWED.\r\n\r\nAfter that night a long time of dreamy stupor seemed to elapse,\r\nbefore any distinct sense of existence forced itself upon me.  Then I\r\nseemed to wake from a heavy slumber (which had frequently been\r\ncrowded by dreadful images), and found myself in bed, and in what\r\nappeared to be a little state-room that opened off a ship's cabin.\r\n\r\nThe roof seemed close and near my eyes; but the bed was soft and\r\nscreened by green curtains, which hung upon a brass rod.  The little\r\npanelled apartment had shelves crammed with books and bundles of\r\npapers; a gun, a cutlass, and telescope were hung on hooks; and from\r\nthe deck above, a bull's-eye threw the sun's rays vertically down\r\nupon me.  I saw all these details at a glance, but believed them to\r\nbe portions of a dream--that I was still tossing in the open boat,\r\nwith my dead or dying companions rolling about in the bilge-water\r\nbelow the thwarts--so my last thoughts of loneliness, of despair, and\r\ncoming death recurred to me in all their bitterness.\r\n\r\nGradually, however, the warmth and softness of the couch on which I\r\nlay became too confirmed and real to be doubted; and now a hot but\r\nsoothing liquid, like mulled wine, was poured between my lips.  I\r\ndrank deeply, and not until the draught was ended did I open my heavy\r\neyes, and again look round me, fearing to dispel the delicious\r\nillusion of imbibing a liquid, for the wild agonies of unassuaged\r\nthirst were still in my memory.\r\n\r\nA jolly and bluff-looking seaman, well tanned by exposure to the\r\nweather, and well whiskered; squat in figure, merry in eye, and\r\nhearty in voice, wearing a straw hat and pea-jacket, with a handsome\r\ngold ring to secure the ends of his black silk neck-tie, was holding\r\nback the green curtain, and surveying me with some solicitude of\r\nmanner.\r\n\r\n\"How do you feel yourself now, my lad?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"Weak--giddy--ill--Hartly--Bob Hartly, keep her head to the break of\r\nthe sea, or we shall be swamped,\" said I, incoherently.\r\n\r\n\"By Jove, I thought the mulled port would bring you up with a round\r\nturn and make you speak if nothing else would.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where am I?\" said I, partially recovering again.\r\n\r\n\"On board ship at last.\"\r\n\r\n\"Which--what ship?\"\r\n\r\n\"The barque _Princess_ of London.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank God--thank God!\" I exclaimed; but though my breast heaved with\r\nwild emotions of joy, not a tear would come, for even that fount of\r\ntenderness seemed dried up within me.\r\n\r\n\"We picked you up when in an awful plight, my poor fellow!  Your boat\r\nwas half full of water, with two dead bodies washing about in it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Two!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes--two, and you were lying in the stern-sheets looking as pale and\r\nas stiff as the others.  We were just about to send you over to\r\nleeward with a cold shot at your heels, when, fortunately, some signs\r\nof life escaped you.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you, sir----\"\r\n\r\n\"Am the master of this craft--Captain John Baylis--I think you won't\r\nforget the name,\" he added, smiling.\r\n\r\n\"Forget it!  Oh, sir, how shall I ever forget it?\" I groaned.  \"But\r\nHartly--poor Bob Hartly!\"\r\n\r\n\"Who was he?\"\r\n\r\n\"_Was_--is he then dead?\" I exclaimed.\r\n\r\n\"I cannot say, until you tell me more.\"\r\n\r\n\"He was Master of the _Leda_, and my dear friend.  She foundered in a\r\ntempest, and those you found in the longboat were the last of\r\ntwenty-five stout fellows who sailed in her from St. John's,\r\nNewfoundland, on the 17th of March.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is he about my size; with very dark whiskers and short curly hair?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then he is getting on famously, and lies in my chief mate's\r\nberth--but you must not speak any more at present, try to sleep; a\r\nlittle time, and I will be with you again.\"\r\n\r\nThis was joyous intelligence!\r\n\r\nIn short, I learned by degrees that Hartly and I were the sole\r\nsurvivors of the crew of the _Leda_.  Paul Reeves and Jones the\r\nseaman had been found dead in the long boat by the crew of the\r\nbarque, who buried them in blankets, each with a heavy shot at their\r\nheels.  After this they scuttled the boat, as the sight of her\r\nsuggested unpleasant ideas.\r\n\r\nThe vessel which picked us up proved to be the barque _Princess_, a\r\nstately Blackwaller of sixteen hundred tons register, Captain John\r\nBaylis, from Quebec, bound for the Cape of Good Hope, with a general\r\ncargo.  Our poor boat, tossing on the sea, had been descried about\r\ndaybreak, by a man who was at work on the maintopgallant yard.  She\r\nimmediately bore down upon us, and hence our rescue at a time so\r\ncritical.  I must have been insensible for about four hours when her\r\ncrew found me; and but for their ministrations, could not have\r\nsurvived another.\r\n\r\nFortunately for Hartly and me, the jolly and hospitable captain had\r\nhis wife on board, and she nursed us with the tenderness of a mother.\r\nIndeed, honest Baylis and his whole crew vied with her in their\r\nattention to us.\r\n\r\nOur feet and legs were so soddened by the bitter, briny water in\r\nwhich they had been so long immersed, that for some days\r\nmortification was dreaded; but as Mrs. Baylis had six goats on board,\r\nshe made, and skilfully applied, poultices of bread and milk, which\r\nameliorated the symptoms and our sufferings.\r\n\r\nFood and liquids were administered to us in homoeopathic doses at\r\nfirst; and several days elapsed before our interiors became\r\naccustomed to receive their usual quantities.  At times we were both\r\nsomewhat bewildered in mind--especially when the vessel encountered\r\nrough weather, and rolled much.  Then Hartly and I were sure to\r\nimagine ourselves again in the longboat on the desolate sea, with the\r\nstarving and dying around us; and long the voices of poor Hans\r\nPeterkin, of Paul Reeves, and the notes of Cuffy's violin, lingered\r\nin my ear, especially in dreams.\r\n\r\nIn about a fortnight--thanks chiefly to the kindness and nursing of\r\nMrs. Baylis--we were able to sit on a sofa under an awning on the\r\npoop-deck; for we were now in warmer latitudes, and a protection from\r\nthe sun of June was necessary.  We greeted each other like two\r\nkinsmen who had escaped death; but Hartly mourned the loss of the\r\n_Leda_ and of her crew, as they were all picked men, whom he never\r\npaid off on entering a port, but who had sailed with him to all parts\r\nof the world, and would as readily have thought of attempting to fly\r\nin the air as of leaving the poor old _Leda_.\r\n\r\nFor many days her loss, and the anecdotes connected with it, formed a\r\nstaple subject for our conversation, until other thoughts, with\r\nreturning health, forced themselves upon us; for those who are in the\r\nworld must live for it.\r\n\r\nThe _Princess_ was bound, I have said, for the Cape of Good Hope,\r\nwhere she would, perhaps, take a freight home for London; but there\r\nwas an equal probability of her being chartered for Bombay, Hong\r\nKong, or anywhere else, so that on reaching Cape Town there would be\r\nan immediate necessity for Hartly and me looking about us, and\r\nseeking means for returning to the great metropolis.\r\n\r\nAs we approached the line, the heat increased rapidly, awnings were\r\nspread over the decks, wind-sails were rigged down the hatchways, and\r\nskeets over the sides were resorted to daily.\r\n\r\nThe latter are pieces of grooved wood, for throwing water over the\r\nplanks or outer sheathing of a ship, to prevent them from being rent\r\nby the heat of the sun in warm climates.\r\n\r\nFor some weeks Hartly and I were totally unable to make ourselves of\r\nany use, so great was the lassitude which succeeded our recent\r\nsufferings, and rapid transition from starvation and misery to\r\ncomfortable quarters, and from the Regions of Ice to those of the\r\nburning sun; for after passing St. Jago, the most southerly of the\r\nCape de Verd Isles, we rapidly approached the line; and then Captain\r\nBaylis, his wife, Hartly, and others, prepared letters for home, to\r\nbe left at the Isle of Ascension, or given to the first ship that\r\npassed us for England.\r\n\r\nDay after day I reclined listlessly under the awning, watching the\r\nshining sea, on which many an argonauta now was floating; and, in a\r\nwarm latitude, singularly beautiful are those little \"Portuguese\r\nmen-of-war,\" as our sailors term them, when whole fleets of them may\r\nbe seen sailing past, with their purple sails up and rowing swiftly,\r\nwith all their tentacula or feelers out.\r\n\r\nBut, on being approached by anything, in go the tentacula, and down\r\nsinks the miniature sail, as the fish concentrates itself in its\r\nshell, and both vanish together, like a fairy in the sea.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIV.\r\n\r\nTHE SAILOR'S POST-OFFICE.\r\n\r\nWe crossed the line on the last day of June.  I need not rehearse the\r\ndescription of a hackneyed ceremony known to all--how curtains were\r\nrigged amidships--how Father Neptune with his hempen beard came on\r\nboard, seated on a gun-carriage, and how roughly all who had _not_\r\ncrossed the line before were tarred, scraped, shaved, and soused by\r\nhis whimsically attired barbers, courtiers, and Tritons, to the great\r\ndelight of the older salts--a ceremony which I only escaped in\r\nconsequence of my recent sufferings.\r\n\r\nTwo days after, we passed St. Matthew, a little desert isle on which\r\nthe Portuguese formed a settlement so early as 1516, and which lies\r\n\"amid the melancholy main,\" at a vast distance from the African\r\ncoast.  It is the abode of sea-birds alone.\r\n\r\nThen we completed our bag of letters, which were all duly gummed\r\nup--wax will not do in the tropics--for delivery at Ascension, which,\r\nafter three hundred miles' further run, we sighted on the evening of\r\nthe 9th July, for we had a fine wind, and the _Princess_ carried her\r\nstuddingsails night and day.\r\n\r\nI was not without hope that we might find some homeward-bound vessel\r\nat Ascension, on board of which we might be transferred, as I was\r\nmost anxious to return home to tranquillize the minds of my own\r\nfamily, whom I knew must long since have numbered me with the dead;\r\nbut this hope was dissipated when we came abreast of the roadstead,\r\nwhich was _empty_, and let go our anchor about midnight, in fourteen\r\nfathom water, on a red sandy bottom.\r\n\r\nThe anchorage of this solitary isle is a sheltered creek,\r\novershadowed by a high pyramidal mountain, having on its summit the\r\nremains of two great crosses, erected of old by the pious and\r\nadventurous followers of Juan de Nova, a Portuguese mariner who\r\nflourished in the days of King Alfonzo Africanus.\r\n\r\nThe heat was so great now that the atmosphere in the cabin rendered\r\none absolutely breathless; and with pleasure, Hartly and I, clad in\r\nlight clothes, with broad straw hats, furnished to us by kind Captain\r\nBaylis, accompanied him and his wife ashore next morning after\r\nanchoring, and landed at the little town, which is fortified, and the\r\nharbour of which frequently forms a rendezvous for our African\r\nsquadron.  The longboat with her crew afterwards came off for fresh\r\nwater and turtles.  The superintendence of collecting these was left\r\nto the chief mate, while with Hartly (who had been there before),\r\nCaptain Baylis and I set forth on a ramble over the island, which is\r\nonly nine miles long by six miles broad.\r\n\r\nAn undefinable interest is excited when landing on a lonely little\r\nisland after a long sea voyage; and for ages Ascension has been a\r\nspecies of halfway house, or resting-place for ships between Europe\r\nand the Cape.\r\n\r\nWe resolved to visit the _Sailor's Post-office_, a cranny in the\r\nrocks, known for ages to the mariners of all nations, who were wont\r\nto deposit their letters there, closed up in a bottle, to be taken\r\naway by the first ship which passed in an opposite direction--a\r\ncustom which the Dominican, Father Navarette, mentions as being\r\n_old_, at the time of his visit in 1673.\r\n\r\nThe little isle is barren, but having been rent by volcanic throes,\r\nit has hills of pumice-stone and calcined rocks, with abrupt\r\nprecipices overhanging sterile ravines that are full of black ashes.\r\nHere and there a solitary goat might be seen cropping the scanty\r\nherbage, or perched upon a sharp pinnacle, snuffing the sea breeze\r\nthat waved its solemn beard.  Where a spring gurgled from the rocks\r\ninto the sea the turtle were seen in plenty, and there our boat's\r\ncrew came in search of them.  There also lay the skeletons of great\r\nnumbers, which seamen, in mere wantonness, had turned on their backs,\r\nand left thus to die.\r\n\r\nFrom the summit of the pyramidal hill which overlooks the anchorage\r\nwe could survey the boundless ocean, spreading away towards the\r\ndistant shores of Africa, the still more distant coast of Peru, and\r\nthe unexplored waves of the Southern Sea, all glassy, heaving, and\r\nvibrating like a mighty mirror under the vertical glare of the\r\ntropical sun.\r\n\r\nFanning ourselves with banana leaves, for at times we gasped in the\r\nheat, we trod among ashes ankle deep, and over rocks where the power\r\nof the sun had turned to fine salt the spray cast upon them by the\r\nsea.\r\n\r\nAt last we reached the Sailor's Post-office, and examined the cleft\r\nin the rocks, where the bottles or cases containing many a letter\r\nthat carried to the hearts and homes of generations long since gone\r\nto dust, hope and happiness, or it might be sorrow and woe--the\r\ntidings of loved and lost ones far away in lands and seas that were\r\nthen so little known and so little traversed; and then combining\r\nprose with poetry, we sat down to discuss some light sherry, pale\r\nale, and sandwiches, which the worthy Captain Baylis insisted on\r\nconveying for us in a travelling-bag slung over his shoulder.\r\n\r\nAs evening drew on, the sterile rocks and impending bluffs, the great\r\nrugged pyramidal hill that towered over the anchorage, the little\r\ntown of Ascension, with its battery and gaudy Union Jack, all assumed\r\na dusky red hue; and when the sun sank westward, the shadow of the\r\n_Princess_ at her anchor was thrown far across the bright blue water\r\nof the creek.  Our last boat with turtle, bananas, fish, and fresh\r\nwater, was to leave the harbour at sunset; so we were preparing to\r\ndescend, when an object lying among some stones at the bottom of the\r\ncleft in the rock, caught Hartly's eye.\r\n\r\nScrambling among ashes and black pumice-stone, he reached, and drew\r\nit forth.\r\n\r\nIt was a stone jar, shaped like a ginger-beer bottle, tightly corked,\r\nand covered over the mouth and neck by thin sheet-lead, which was\r\npaid over with old tarred spunyarn; but it was so thickly encrusted\r\nwith lichens and dust, which the sun and dew had baked upon it, that\r\nit had quite the colour and aspect of the stones that lay around it.\r\n\r\n\"Now, what the deuce is this?\" asked Captain Baylis.\r\n\r\n\"A bottle,\" said Hartly, turning it over.\r\n\r\n\"A bottle in the Post-office!\"\r\n\r\n\"It must have lain here a long time, if we judge by its outside,\"\r\nsaid I.\r\n\r\n\"Letters have never been deposited here since 1816,\" observed Baylis,\r\n\"when the British built the town and battery yonder.\"\r\n\r\n\"So if it has lain here one year, it must have lain fifty.\"\r\n\r\n\"Shake it, Hartly,\" said I.\r\n\r\n\"It is full of something that rattles!\"\r\n\r\n\"Letters, probably; but few folks can care about them now.\"\r\n\r\n\"Faith! the man's head does not ache that untwisted this spunyarn; it\r\nis at least seventy years old!\" said Captain Baylis, fraying the\r\nstrands with his fingers; \"but we'll crack the bottle when we get on\r\nboard, and see what the contents are.\"\r\n\r\nWe joined Mrs. Baylis at the landing-place.  She was reclining in the\r\nstern of the gig with a large white umbrella over her head, and could\r\nscarcely repress her curiosity to discover the contents of the old\r\nstone jug, or bottle, till we got on board.\r\n\r\nThen we broke it by a blow of a hammer, and there fell out, not\r\nletters, as we expected, but a roll of paper, consisting of leaves\r\nstitched together, and closely covered with writing, containing a\r\nnarrative, or something of the kind, which had been deposited in that\r\nstrange mode and strange place by some waggish or eccentric person,\r\nin the hope, perhaps, that if ever discovered, by the mystery\r\nenveloping their literary production, it would assuredly be given to\r\nthe public.\r\n\r\nIt was without date; but fortunately the handwriting was plain and\r\nlegible, though the ink was dim and faded, for the stone bottle being\r\nporous, the paper had become damp, almost wet, and had to be\r\ncarefully dried in the sunshine, which curled it up like crisped\r\nleaves in autumn, so the preparation of it for perusal was consigned\r\nto my care by Captain Baylis, who had discovered that I was, as he\r\nsaid, \"a regular-built bookworm.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is a history,\" said he, as he lighted his long clay pipe in the\r\ncabin, after the _Princess_ got under weigh next evening, and stood\r\nout of the anchorage under her courses and topgallant sails, with her\r\nroyals, spanker, and gaff-topsail set.\r\n\r\n\"Or the narrative of an unfortunate voyage,\" suggested Hartly,\r\nthinking, doubtless, of his own.\r\n\r\n\"Or the revelation of some dreadful crime, or unfortunate\r\nlove-story,\" lisped Mrs. Baylis, all impatience, pausing and looking\r\nup in the act of pouring out our tea.\r\n\r\n\"It is none of these,\" said I; \"but seems to be the translation of a\r\nPortuguese legend, connected in some way with the discovery of the\r\nCape of Good Hope.\"\r\n\r\nAnd so, while the good captain lounged in his shirt sleeves on the\r\ncabin sofa, and puffed away with his long clay pipe, while his buxom\r\nwife made tea for us, and Hartly lit his Havannah, I commenced to\r\nread the MS. we had found so singularly; and it ran thus--but\r\nrequires a chapter or two to itself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXV.\r\n\r\nMS. LEGEND OF EL CABO DOS TORMENTOS.\r\n\r\nIt is written--says the Spanish Dominican Friar and Missionary\r\nPriest, the Padre Navarette--that the first time reports reached\r\nEurope of a spectre haunting the Cape of Storms, was by the\r\nnarratives of certain Portuguese adventurers, who sailed into the\r\nSouthern Sea, with the Senhor Bartholomew Diaz, in the early part of\r\nthe fifteenth century, when Dom Joam II. occupied the throne of\r\nPortugal.\r\n\r\nHis cousin and successor, King Emmanuel, fired by the discoveries\r\nmade in the reigns of his predecessors, who had planted their flag\r\nand cross on the shores of Madeira, the Azores, and Isles of the Cape\r\nde Verd, resolved to accomplish what they had failed in, and with\r\npraiseworthy zeal despatched an admiral to discover a passage to\r\nIndia by sea.\r\n\r\nAfter a long absence this cavalier returned and reported that he had\r\nfound the _southern_ extremity of the mighty African continent; but,\r\nthat his ships had encountered great perils when off a flat-headed\r\nmountain of wondrous form, which he had named _El Cabo dos Tormentos_.\r\n\r\nThe King of Portugal suggested that \"_El Cabo de Buena Esperanto_,\r\n(_i.e._, the Cape of Good Hope), would be a better term;\" and it was\r\nat once adopted by his courtiers, though the mariners of the Admiral\r\nadhered to \"the Cape of Torments,\" as they alleged that, not only had\r\nthey nearly been swallowed by the waves of a black and stormy sea,\r\nbut that they had seen a stupendous form, resembling a human figure,\r\nriding upon the whirling scud above the Table Mountain, and spreading\r\nhis giant arms as if to clasp them in his terrible embrace, and hurl\r\nthem into the yawning deep.\r\n\r\nThey insisted that this dangerous promontory was the end of the\r\nhabitable world--the abode of devils, spectres, and torments--a place\r\nwherein nothing human could dwell; and that the seas which washed its\r\nshore should be shunned by all future navigators.\r\n\r\nThey ridiculed the title of _Buena Esperança_, and urged that no\r\nmariner in his senses would visit the place again; for the old salts\r\nof those days devoutly believed in tales of\r\n\r\n  \"That sea-snake tremendous curled,\r\n  Whose monstrous circle girds the world,\"\r\n\r\nand that the earth was girt with fire at the Equator; that whoever\r\npassed the tempestuous Cape Bojador, which was first doubled by the\r\nPortuguese in 1433, and which forms the southern limit of Morocco,\r\nwas doomed never to return, as a mysterious breeze (the trade wind?)\r\nblew for ever against them; that ships got into currents that ran\r\n_down hill_--currents against which they might beat and struggle in\r\nvain, till their shattered hulls were cast upon Bermuda--the \"vexed\r\nBermoothes\" of Shakespeare, which, as Stowe tells us, \"were supposed\r\nto be inhabited by witches and devils\"--an iron shore where perpetual\r\nstorms raged, and fated ships were dashed upon the rocks.\r\n\r\nDespite these terrors, animated by a spirit of adventure, Vasco da\r\nGama, a valiant mariner and cavalier of Alentejo, resolved to sail in\r\nquest of this terrible cape, accompanied by many of his friends,\r\namong whom was a noble young hidalgo, named Vasco da Lobiera,\r\ngrandson of the gallant knight of that name, who fought at the battle\r\nof Aljubarotta, and received his spurs on the field from King Joam of\r\ngood memory, at whose feet, in after years, he laid his famous\r\nromance, \"Amadis de Gaul.\"\r\n\r\nFrom his grandsire young Vasco inherited a love of wild adventure;\r\nthus his mind was full of tales of\r\n\r\n  \"The days when giants were rife\r\n    With their towers and painted halls,\r\n  And heroes, each with a charmed life,\r\n    Rode up to their castle walls--\r\n  When gentle and bright ones with golden hair\r\n    Were wooed by princes in green,\r\n  And knights with invisible caps to wear,\r\n    Could see, and yet never be seen.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the alleged terrors of the spectre or storm fiend\r\nwhich haunted the Cape, the brave Da Gama and his friend Lobiera\r\nresolved to set forth upon these mysterious waters, and to double the\r\npromontory of Southern Africa.  So the former, as Captain-General,\r\nhoisted his banner on board the _San Gabriel_, of two hundred and\r\ntwenty tons; while Paulo da Gama, his brother, commanded the _San\r\nRafael_, of one hundred tons.\r\n\r\nVasco da Lobiera had the caravella named _Nossa Senhora da Belem_ (or\r\nBethlehem), with Joam da Coimbra as pilot, and Gonsalo Nunez had\r\ntheir great storeship laden with provisions.\r\n\r\nAll these vessels were built of the pines which were planted in the\r\nforest of Marinha by King Denis the Magnificent, and were manned by\r\none hundred and sixty chosen mariners.\r\n\r\nKing Emmanuel made them a farewell oration, and gave into the hands\r\nof each commander a white silk banner of the military order of\r\nChrist, together with his royal letters to an imaginary potentate,\r\nwho was supposed to dwell beyond the Southern Sea, and was named\r\nPrester John of the Indies, Lord and Emperor of Ethiopia; and so,\r\nwith the prayers of all good Portuguese for their success, the little\r\nsquadron sailed from Lisbon, on the 8th July, 1497, when it is\r\nrecorded that \"thousands remained weeping on the shore, until the\r\nlast traces of the receding fleet had disappeared.\"\r\n\r\nAmong their own crews, as well as among those of the other two ships,\r\nDa Gama and Da Lobiera found men averse to touching at the Cabo dos\r\nTormentos; and these urged, that to double this dreadful promontory,\r\nthey should stand further out to sea than the adventurers of Dom\r\nJoam's days, and then visit in safety the realms of Prester John on\r\nthe other side.  Gama and his friend heeded neither their remarks,\r\ntheir exhortations, or their fears, but bore away steadily to the\r\nsouthward.\r\n\r\nAfter a long and perilous voyage, and after anchoring in a great bay\r\nwhich they named Angra de Santa Elena, the crew of _Our Lady of\r\nBelem_ first saw the land of Table Bay on the morning of Saturday,\r\nthe 4th of November, when, in obedience to Dom Vasco da Lobiera, the\r\nship's company donned their gayest apparel, discharged a volley from\r\ntheir culverins, and blew all their trumpets; but, as they stood\r\ntowards the shore, they were compelled to lessen their canvas, for\r\nthe wind, which had hitherto been moderate and favourable, now\r\nchanged to the south-east, and increased to a gale, while the sun set\r\nin dense clouds, and turning from light green to black, the waves\r\nbegan to froth and break as they alternately rose into hills or sank\r\ninto valleys.\r\n\r\nAnd now as night and mist descended together on the sea, and on the\r\nCabo dos Tormentos, lightnings began to play about the awful summit\r\nof the Table Mountain, which rises for more than three thousand two\r\nhundred feet above the shore.  The four ships which prior to this\r\nevening had kept close together, were compelled by the violence of\r\nthe gale to separate, lest they might be dashed against each other;\r\nand in the murk and gloom they continued to beat against the\r\nheadwind, with their topsail-yards lowered upon the cap, their\r\ncourses close reefed, and their spritsails stowed.\r\n\r\nWhen the vessels last saw each other, the Senhor Vasco da Lobiera was\r\nmuch chagrined to perceive that his caravella had dropped far astern\r\nof her companions.  He had ever prided himself upon the swiftness of\r\nher sailing, and now he burned lights, and strove to come abreast of\r\nthe Captain-General, who had beat far to windward, and who he feared\r\nmight attribute his drifting so much a-lee, and towards danger, to\r\nwant of skill or seamanship.\r\n\r\nHe set as much canvas as he dared, and _Nossa Senhora da Belem_ tore\r\nthrough the angry sea with her foresail and foretopsail close reefed,\r\nand her jib and spritsail set, while the waves lashed her worn sides,\r\nand burst in foam over her carved and lofty prow at every furious\r\nplunge.\r\n\r\nThe seamen told their beads, lit candles before the shrine of Nossa\r\nSenhora in the great cabin, shook their heads, muttered under their\r\nlong black beards, or maintained gloomy silence, fearing they knew\r\nnot what, but anticipating all the terrors that had beset the\r\nfollowers of Bartholomew Diaz in the same waters.\r\n\r\nAnd now wave after wave broke in thundering volume over her decks,\r\ntill Lobiera was fain to cast overboard the brass culverins which had\r\nbeen consecrated by the Bishop of Lisbon, and his men averred that\r\neach uttered _a cry_ as it sank into the sea.\r\n\r\nBy midnight they were, as Joam da Coimbra stated, about six miles\r\nfrom the mouth of Table Bay.\r\n\r\nHoarsely roared the wind through the strained shrouds of the\r\nlabouring caravella, as she rolled and pitched wildly amid the black\r\nand fearful waste of water, and ere long she was driving under bare\r\npoles with only her jib and staysail to lift her head from the sea,\r\nwhich rushed upon her like a succession of watery mountains.\r\n\r\nWith all the firmness of true mariners and cavaliers, Vasco da\r\nLobiera and his friend Joam stood at the tiller, crossing themselves\r\never and anon when they shouted a command through the trumpet, or\r\ninvoked our Lady of Belem.  The deck had long since been cleared of\r\nevery loose spar, bucket, or other material by the waves; and more\r\nthan one poor mariner had been swept overboard to perish miserably in\r\nthe midnight sea, for no human hand could assist them.\r\n\r\nSome there were who asserted that they had seen the claws of a giant\r\nfigure start from the black waves, and drag their shipmates down\r\nbelow by their beards and trunk hose.\r\n\r\n\"We make no progress,\" said others, rending their hair; \"a mighty\r\nmagnet, buried deep in the sea, holds us to one accursed spot!\"\r\n\r\n\"Nay,\" said Joam da Coimbra; \"'tis the teeth of a mighty fish that\r\ngrasp our keel.\"\r\n\r\n\"Be of good cheer, I pray you, my friends,\" said Vasco, pointing to\r\nthe Southern Cross, which was then visible through a rent in the fast\r\nflying scud; \"behold the sign by which we shall conquer!  What says\r\nthe motto of our country?\"\r\n\r\n\"_In hoc signo vinces!_\" exclaimed Joam da Coimbra, throwing his\r\nhands towards the south.\r\n\r\n\"Amen,\" responded the terrified crew, and still their ship bore on.\r\n\r\n\"Thou art right, Joam,\" said Vasco da Lobiera; and the courage of the\r\ncrew revived, for their pilot was a mariner of great experience, and,\r\nlike Chaucer's shipman--\r\n\r\n  \"By many a tempest had his beard been shaken.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVI.\r\n\r\nLEGEND CONTINUED--THE CATASTROPHE.\r\n\r\nThe moon, which had hitherto been concealed in dense vapour, now\r\nglanced at times through the flying clouds.  It was one of those\r\nstormy moons well known in that quarter of the world.  She seemed\r\nsmall, but keen and bright, gilding with whitest silver the ragged\r\nedges of the torn vapour, which fled past with such speed as to give\r\nher literally the aspect of sailing through the sky.\r\n\r\nA mournful and moaning sound now came upon the wind which traversed\r\nthat dashing sea, and the mariners of Lobiera, who had never looked\r\non such a scene, nor beheld such lightnings as those that girdled\r\nlike a fiery belt the flat summit of the Table Mountain, were\r\nbecoming more bewildered and faint of heart, when a cry of dismay\r\nburst from Joam da Coimbra, and now even the resolute Vasco stood\r\nspeechless and aghast.\r\n\r\nAbove the Table Mountain the clouds rapidly rolled themselves into a\r\ndenser and darker mass, which assumed the outline of a human figure\r\nthat grew in volume while they gazed upon it, until it towered into\r\nthe sky, against the moonlit blue of which it was defined with\r\nterrible distinctness.\r\n\r\n\"The spectre--il demonio del Cabo dos Tormentos!\" said each in his\r\nheart, while it continued to tower, with mighty arms outstretched, as\r\nif to clutch the devoted ship, or bury it in the sea that seethed\r\naround this dreadful cape--the great promontory of the southern world.\r\n\r\nWith one foot planted on Table Mountain, and the other on the Devil's\r\nHill, with a head that darkened heaven, stood this mighty form, which\r\nappeared to have the power of curbing and of loosening the elements,\r\nfor at every wave of its threatening arms the sea increased in\r\nturbulence, and the wind in fury, for the thunder appeared to be his\r\nvoice, the lightning the flashes of his eye, the tempest the breath\r\nof his nostrils!\r\n\r\n\"Madre de Dios--our Lady of Belem!\" prayed Dom Vasco.\r\n\r\n\"Dei genetrix, intercede pro nobis!\" was the faint response of his\r\nquailing crew.\r\n\r\n\"Courage, comrades,\" he exclaimed; \"I have still the blessed banner\r\nwhich our Lord the King gave me, and it shall yet float above the\r\nstorm.\"\r\n\r\n\"But the ship has become unmanageable!\" cried Joam da Coirabra.\r\n\r\n\"Nay, say not so--Heaven forefend!  _Nossa Senhora da Belem_ is as\r\ngallant a craft as ever came from the woods of Marinha, and she shall\r\nbear us yet to seas beyond the power of this resentful demon!\"\r\n\r\nVasco da Lobiera would have said more, but a burst of thunder drowned\r\nevery other sound; lightning filled the entire sky with lurid flame;\r\nthe wind bellowed, and the blinding rain descended in a solid sheet\r\nupon the trembling sea with such power as almost to still its waves.\r\nHe ordered the masts to be cut away; only two of his crew heard the\r\norder, or had the courage to obey it.  The rest were crouching in a\r\ngroup, stupified by despair and fear.\r\n\r\nThree blows of a sharp axe were alone required, the tempest did the\r\nrest, and the stately masts with all their yards and gear vanished\r\nalongside.  The rudder was torn from its iron bands, and now the\r\nboasted _Lady of Belem_ floated like a log upon the waves, which\r\nincessantly broke over her, washing the crew in succession away.  Now\r\nit was that the heart of Vasco da Lobiera began to sink, and he gave\r\nhimself up for lost!\r\n\r\nIn a few minutes more he found himself struggling in the sea, for his\r\nship was hurled upon the rocky coast and dashed to pieces.\r\n\r\nClutching a piece of wreck, he was tossed up by a vast wave, that\r\ncast him stunned, breathless, helpless and alone, upon the desolate\r\nshore of that terrible promontory; so his holy banner availed him\r\nnothing.\r\n\r\nAnd there he lay as the sea receded, wave after wave continuing to\r\nhiss and roar behind him, as if loth to lose their prey.\r\n\r\n* * * * *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVII\r\n\r\nLEGEND CONCLUDED--THE SEQUEL.\r\n\r\nWhen the Senhor Dom Vasco came to his senses, says the Padre\r\nNavarette, morning had dawned.  All nature was calm, and the warm\r\nrays of the rising sun were shedding light and gladness on the land\r\nand sea.\r\n\r\nAbove him rose in sullen majesty the triple crest of the Table\r\nMountain, the Devil's Hill, and the Hill of Lions; and undisturbed by\r\na single ripple before him lay that treacherous sea, which, but a few\r\nhours before, had destroyed _Nossa Senhora da Belem_.  With some\r\nsurprise, Vasco found that his doublet and hose were dry; and that\r\nhis bruises were not so severe as he might have expected, under all\r\nthe circumstances.\r\n\r\nHe arose, invoked Heaven on his knees, and surveyed the watery plain\r\nwith anxiety, to discover whether any fragment of the wrecked\r\ncaravella was floating there; but not a vestige was to be seen, and\r\napparently none of his crew had reached the shore save himself, all\r\nhad perished.\r\n\r\nThe forlorn cavalier could not repress an exclamation of bitterness\r\nand grief, on realizing the full horror of this catastrophe; for he\r\nloved his crew, and also the little caravella in which he had sailed\r\nso gaily from the Tagus, on that auspicious 8th of July.\r\n\r\nDistant from his native land many, many thousand miles, without a\r\nhope of rescue or release, he was about to abandon himself to\r\ndespair, when in the vague hope of meeting another survivor, he\r\ntraversed the plain which lies at the base of the Table Mountain, and\r\nwhich was then covered by white lilies, gorgeous tulips, and almond\r\ntrees, all growing wild.\r\n\r\nTo add to his grief and terror, here he found the remains of his\r\nfriend, Joam da Coimbra, half devoured by lions or wolves, who had\r\ndragged him from the beach.  Dom Vasco shuddered, and was hastening\r\non, when a deep voice that seemed to fill the whole welkin, cried,\r\n\r\n\"_Stay!_\"\r\n\r\nHe turned, and beheld a copper-coloured man of wondrous stature, and\r\nsavage, yet noble aspect, who held in his right hand a hunting spear,\r\nso long, that it was twice the length of any Vasco had ever\r\nseen--aye, thrice the length of the lance his grandsire had carried\r\nat Aljubarrota--and in his left a reeking skin, which he had just\r\ntorn from a lion--perhaps one of those that had been feasting on the\r\nhapless pilot.  His aspect was alike sublime and terrible; his black\r\nbeard was of majestic length; his bright eyes wore a sad and gloomy\r\nexpression, and his hair which rose in great curls, like those of the\r\nPhidian Jove, resembled the mane of a sable lion.  But what is\r\nstranger than all, this wild man spoke very good Portuguese.\r\n\r\n\"In the name of Heaven,\" said the cavalier, \"who and what are you?\"\r\n\r\n\"The spirit of the Cabo dos Tormentos--the demon of the storm which\r\nrent your ship asunder, and cast it on yonder shores, dashed to a\r\nthousand pieces,\" replied the form in a deep, but melodious voice.\r\n\r\nVasco--continues the Padre Navarette--doubted the evidence of his\r\nsenses.  This was like one of the adventures with which the history\r\nof \"Amadis de Gaul\" had filled his mind--one for which he longed; but\r\nhe felt the reality the reverse of pleasant.\r\n\r\n\"I have ruled these regions since the ark rested on Mount Ararat, and\r\nsince the land was parted from the waters; but never until now, has\r\nthe foot of man invaded them; and had my power prevailed in the storm\r\nof yesternight, instead of being here, thou too shouldst have found a\r\ngrave where many other adventurers lie, in yonder rolling sea.\"\r\n\r\n\"Terrible spirit,\" said Dom Vasco, \"is the presence of a mere mortal\r\nso hateful to you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" replied the demon, shaking his mighty locks with gloom and\r\nsadness; \"for now my power over these seas, and shores, and clouds,\r\nmust end where thine begins.  Else, wherefore did I bury ship after\r\nship in that tempestuous sea, or split them by the flaming bolts,\r\nthat all on board might perish?  Many have sought to pass my\r\npromontory, to reach the golden realms of Prester John, but none have\r\nescaped me save _thee_!  I have had the power of assuming what form I\r\nplease.  To-day I am a man, to-morrow I should tower to the skies\r\nastride the Table Mountain, or ride the wild blast that comes from\r\nthe arid desert of Zahara, to bury some barque in the distant sea;\r\nbut that my power is passing away from me.  I tell thee, O most\r\nfortunate and valiant cavalier, that from this day the Cabo dos\r\nTormentos shall be a Cape of Storms no more, but one of Good Hope to\r\nall the mariners of the earth--for so it was ordained by the hand\r\nwhich placed Adam in Eden and gave such wondrous power unto the Seal\r\nof Solomon.\"\r\n\r\nAs the spirit concluded, his voice became fainter; his broad and\r\ndusky chest heaved as he sighed deeply, and he gradually appeared to\r\ndissolve into a thin white vapour, which floated upwards and melted\r\naway on the summit of the Table Mountain.  But the power of the\r\nspirit lingers there still; for over the same spot where he vanished\r\nfrom the eyes of Dom Vasco, _a thin white cloud_, which rises from\r\nthe hill, is unto this day the sure forerunner of a storm.*\r\n\r\n\r\n* In summer, when the S.E. wind blows, a cloud called _the\r\nTablecloth_ appears on the mountain, and always indicates a tempest.\r\nThis cloud is composed of immense masses of fleecy\r\nwhiteness.--_Arnott_.\r\n\r\n\r\nNext day, the _San Rafael_, the vessel of Da Gama, which had been\r\ngreatly shattered by the tempest, appeared off Table Bay, and on\r\nVasco da Lobiera making signals, a boat was sent for him and he was\r\nbrought on board, more dead than alive after all he had undergone.\r\n\r\nTo the wondering followers of his friend, he related his adventure.\r\nThey deplored the loss of his caravella, and of so many good and\r\npious Portuguese; but they shook their long beards doubtfully when he\r\nspoke of the spectre, though the unusual calmness of the weather\r\nabout the Cabo dos Tormentos seemed to verify his story and the\r\npromises made to him.\r\n\r\nOn being joined by the vessels of Paulo da Gama and Gonzalo Nunez,\r\nthey bore away to the eastward, and named the coast La Terra de Noel\r\n(or Natal) having anchored off it on Christmas Day.  Sixty leagues\r\nfrom the Cape, they found a bay, which they named San Blaz, and in it\r\nan island, full of birds with bat's-wings.  (Penguins.)\r\n\r\nThus the passage of the Cape of Storms was fully achieved and the\r\nspell broken by these valiant Portuguese; but they could nowhere\r\ndiscover the realms of Prester John, so the royal letters of Dom\r\nEmmanuel remained unopened.\r\n\r\nOn his return to Lisbon, Dom Vasco applied to the King of Portugal\r\nfor a gift of the Table Mountain, and money to colonize the land\r\nabout it, in virtue of his interview with the spectre; but he was\r\nlaughed at by the courtiers, and especially by the priests, who\r\nproved his greatest enemies.\r\n\r\nThe King, after this, styled himself Lord of the Seas on both sides\r\nof Africa; Lord of Guinea, Ethiopia, Persia, India, Brazil, and many\r\nother lands; but how fared it with Dom Vasco da Lobiera?\r\n\r\nFury, pride, and mortification turned his brain; but he survived till\r\nthe reign of King Joam III., when he was last seen, an old and\r\nimpoverished man, with a white head and threadbare doublet, hovering\r\nin the Rua d'Agua de Flore in Lisbon, at the gate of the Estrella, or\r\nat the chapel of Nossa Senhora da Belem, raving to the passers about\r\nthe friendly Demon of el Cabo de Buena Esperança, and the colony of\r\nwhich the King had deprived him.\r\n\r\nSo--says the Padre Navarette--ends this wild story.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVIII.\r\n\r\nWE LAND IN AFRICA.\r\n\r\nAnd now to resume my own more simple narrative.\r\n\r\nThe barque _Princess_, which, until we touched at Ascension, had been\r\nfavoured with singularly fine weather, now encountered strong\r\nhead-winds.  She was driven out of her course, and had to run well\r\nin, on the African coast.\r\n\r\nAfter long beating about, on the 2nd of August we saw the great\r\ncontinent on the southern shore of the Gulf of Guinea.\r\n\r\nThe winds had become light and the weather cloudy.  On this day I\r\nremember the crew were variously employed, and the carpenters were\r\nbusy in making two new topgallant masts, to replace those injured in\r\nthe rough weather we had so recently encountered.\r\n\r\nAbout six P.M. the weather became squally.  Captain Baylis ordered\r\nthe studding-sails to be taken in, and the chain-cables bent to the\r\nanchors.  At midnight we took in the royals and flying-jib.\r\n\r\nAt four o'clock on the morning of the 3rd, as we required fresh\r\nwater, we came to anchor in a little sheltered bay of the Rio Gabon,\r\nwhich lies between the Bight of Benin and Cape Lopez Gonsalvo.\r\n\r\nThe wondrous transparency of the atmosphere here exceeded all I had\r\nseen--even in the pure region of eternal ice; for amid the clear\r\nsplendour of the heavens, the eye could observe without a telescope\r\nmany a lesser star unseen in the north; and on this morning when we\r\nwere coming to anchor, two of the fixed planets shone with a\r\nrefulgence so brilliant as to cast the shadow of the ships far across\r\nthe estuary.\r\n\r\nBy this time, the hot vertical sun of the tropics had peeled all the\r\npaint off the blistered sides of the _Princess_.  Her anchors and\r\nironwork had become mere masses of red rust, her once white paint had\r\nbeen turned to orange colour, and her tar to dirty yellow, while the\r\ncaulking and pitch had boiled out from her planks and seams.\r\n\r\nCaptain Baylis had no intention of remaining here longer than he\r\ncould avoid, as the climate is unhealthy.  Though the hills which\r\noverlook the river are of considerable height, the land between it\r\nand them is but a series of swamps, where the gigantic water-weeds of\r\nAfrica and the wild mangrove-trees flourish in rank luxuriance, and\r\nwhere the hideous crocodile squatters in the slime, or crawls along\r\nthe sand, where its eggs are hatched by the hot sun, if they are not\r\npreviously stolen by the ichneumon.\r\n\r\nWhile the chief mate went off in the long-boat to the Pongos--as the\r\nlittle isles at the mouth of the estuary are named--to fill several\r\ncasks with fresh water, Captain Baylis proposed a visit to a negro\r\nvillage on the coast, for the purpose of procuring some elephants'\r\nteeth and leopard skins, and having a _palaver_ with the natives,\r\nmany of whom, though extremely savage, have picked up a little\r\nEnglish by the frequent visits of our ships, particularly those of\r\nthe African squadron.\r\n\r\nWith a view to barter, he placed in his gig four old rusty muskets,\r\nsome well-worn table knives, old coats, pots and kettles, while, to\r\nbe prepared for any emergency, four rifles, carefully loaded and\r\ncapped, were concealed in the stern sheets, and Mrs. Baylis, Hartly,\r\nand I accompanied him on this expedition, which was the commencement\r\nof a series of disasters, that ended in the destruction of nearly all\r\nconcerned.\r\n\r\nFor the lady's comfort, an awning was rigged over the stern of the\r\ngig, which, being rowed by eight oars, ran rapidly close in shore,\r\nwhere we saw a number of black fellows in a state of semi-nudity,\r\ngabbling, gesticulating violently, and watching our arrival with\r\nconsiderable interest.\r\n\r\nSome of their actions seeming to indicate hostility as they\r\nbrandished long spears and asseguys, Captain Baylis stood up in the\r\nboat and displayed his old pots and kettles, making signs that he\r\nwished to trade or barter with them.  On this they uttered a\r\nsimultaneous yell, and disappeared among the mangroves, which fringed\r\nall the bank of the river, and formed a species of natural arcade by\r\ntheir branches arching over from the solid soil, and taking root in\r\nthe slimy water.\r\n\r\nOf this unsatisfactory result we could make nothing; but in no way\r\ndaunted, Captain Baylis (though saying that he \"wished he had left\r\nhis good wife on board\") steered for a little creek, on entering\r\nwhich, we lost sight alike of the Pongo islets and the _Princess_,\r\nwhich lay at anchor in the estuary, about four miles off.\r\n\r\nBeaching partly the sharp-prowed and handsome gig in the soft sand,\r\nBaylis, Hartly, and I sprang ashore, and looked in every direction\r\namong the tall weeds and mangroves for our sable traders; but all was\r\nsilent and still.  The breast of the broad river was undisturbed by a\r\nripple, and seemed to sleep in the sultry sunshine; the silence of\r\nthe mighty forests that grew along its banks was unbroken by a sound;\r\nand the vast baobab or calibash trees, with their gigantic yellow\r\nfruit and wondrous horizontal branches, covered by foliage, were\r\ndrooping listlessly in the hot and breathless atmosphere of the\r\ntropical noon.\r\n\r\n\"I don't understand this, and, moreover, I don't much like it,\" said\r\nCaptain Baylis, in a low voice to Hartly and me; \"for when I was here\r\nbefore I found the darkies ready enough to 'make friends,' as they\r\nterm it, and to exchange their elephants' tusks, panther skins, and\r\ncamwood for any rubbish we could collect on board.\"\r\n\r\nBut he knew not that, at this time, one of the crew of an American\r\nship which sailed on the previous day had wantonly shot the fetisher,\r\nor priest of a village, and thus inspired the people with hostility\r\nto all white strangers; and it is not improbable that they conceived\r\nthe Yankee and the _Princess_ to be one and the same vessel.\r\n\r\nAfter looking about us for some time, and finding that none of the\r\nnatives returned, Baylis proposed that we should pull a little higher\r\nup the stream, to the village of the Rio Serpientes--or Snake River,\r\nas it is called in the charts--a tributary of the Gabon.\r\n\r\nThe giant size of the plants, shrubs, and trees, their wonderful\r\ngreenness and luxuriance, the brilliance of the flowers, the loud hum\r\nof insect-life, where insects are as large as birds at home, the\r\ndepth of the forest dingles, and the overpowering heat of the\r\natmosphere, all served to impress me with novelty and strangeness;\r\nwhile mingled emotions of wonder, pleasure, and apprehension filled\r\nmy breast.\r\n\r\nWith deep interest I trod this wondrous soil, of which so little is\r\nknown.  \"For three centuries,\" says some one, \"our ships have\r\ncircumnavigated Africa, and yet, with a few exceptions, our knowledge\r\nof its districts is very incomplete; while the interior presents to\r\nthe eye a _blank_ in geography--an unsolved problem, in moral as well\r\nas physical science.\"  Though nearly four thousand years ago the\r\nvalley of the Nile was the cradle of art and commerce, we know no\r\nmore about the Mountains of the Moon than old Ptolemy himself knew.\r\n\r\nWe were about to re-embark, when the united yells of more than a\r\nhundred negroes rent the clear welkin, and starting from the leafy\r\nseclusion of the mangroves into the blaze of sunlight, a horde of\r\nblack and naked savages rushed upon us with long asseguys, bows,\r\nclubs, and knives; and in a moment we found ourselves their prisoners.\r\n\r\nTwo seamen in the bow of the gig, while attempting to shove her off,\r\nwere struck through the body with poisoned spears, and slain on the\r\ninstant; the rest were dragged out, the gig itself was lifted fairly\r\nout of the water, hoisted on the brawny shoulders of nearly twenty\r\nmen, and borne with yells of derision and exultation up the bank,\r\nwhere they hurled it high and dry ashore among the mangroves; while\r\nat the same moment, poor Baylis with horror saw his shrieking wife\r\ndragged by others into the jungle.\r\n\r\nAfter being beaten with asseguy-shafts until we were nearly\r\nsenseless, our clothes were rent from us roughly, and in a state\r\nnearly approaching nudity, covered with bruises, and in some\r\ninstances with blood, we were dragged into a thicket, and brought\r\nbefore the King of the village, who was seated on a grass matting,\r\nwhich was spread under the umbrageous shadow of a baobab-tree, where\r\nhe was smoking a great wooden pipe.\r\n\r\nAll this passed in less than five minutes; and I was so stunned by\r\nthe rapidity of the transaction, as well as by several blows received\r\non the head from lance-shafts, that the whole affair resembled a\r\nterrible dream!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIX.\r\n\r\nTHE KING OF THE SNAKE RIVER\r\n\r\nIn that district of Africa every village has its petty monarch, and\r\nthese are all vassals of the King of Gabon, who, in turn, is vassal\r\nof the King of Benin; and Zabadie, the sooty sovereign of this\r\nempire, had just died about this time.\r\n\r\nThe town, or capital (of his Majesty of the Snake River), if it could\r\nbe so named, in which we found ourselves, was composed of some six\r\nhundred huts or so; and these resembled a large collection of\r\nbeehives, being constructed with meshes, twigs, straw, and turf.\r\n\r\nI was dragged to the door of one, while a savage, whom I conceived to\r\nbe the proprietor, and who wore a large coin at his neck, threw in my\r\nhat, coat, vest, and trowsers, of which he had violently possessed\r\nhimself, being a person in authority and near relation of the King.\r\nWhile he grasped me by a thong which secured my right wrist, I could\r\nperceive within that his dwelling consisted of one apartment, the\r\nappurtenances of which were only mats, calibashes, a stone mortar for\r\npounding millet, and a cauldron of earthenware.\r\n\r\nClosing the door, which was composed of basket-work, he dragged me to\r\nour forlorn group, which stood before the King, who for some time\r\npermitted us to be pelted with stones, decayed gourds, and pulpy\r\nwater-melons, by the women and children of his capital; and under\r\nthis treatment and her terror, poor Captain Baylis saw his\r\nunfortunate wife about to sink without being able to yield her the\r\nleast assistance, as the point of an asseguy menaced his throat at\r\nthe slightest movement.\r\n\r\nAs an accessory to the alarm our situation excited within us, close\r\nby where his Majesty sat was a negro, on whom a sentence of his had\r\njust been executed.\r\n\r\nThis miserable wretch had been tied to a stake, disembowelled alive,\r\nand had his body thereafter filled with hot salt.  Despite the\r\nterrors of our own situation, his dying agonies suggested terrible\r\nthoughts of what our own fate might be.  At last his contortions and\r\nquiverings ceased for ever, and then, on the hoarse beating of an old\r\nArab drum, the pelting was stopped, the King of the Snakes laid aside\r\nhis pipe, and while all his sable subjects, save those who guarded\r\nus, prostrated themselves on the turf, he commenced to address us;\r\nand Baylis, who knew something of his jargon, replied, and translated\r\nthe conversation to us.\r\n\r\nThe Captain earnestly deprecated our treatment, as we had come among\r\nthem with the peaceful intention of trading.  He pled especially on\r\nbehalf of his wife, and offered a great store of bottled rum, old\r\nfirelocks, pots, kettles, brass buttons, and iron nails, as ransom\r\nfor us all.\r\n\r\nAt these offers his sable Majesty, the Solon of the Snake River,\r\nbefore whom had been laid the entire contents of the gig, with the\r\nbloody garments of the poor fellows slain in her, only grinned from\r\ntime to time, and then uttered a diabolical laugh, which boded us no\r\ngood.\r\n\r\nThis savage chief presented a dreadful aspect.  Black as ebony, tall,\r\nstrong, and muscular in form, he had a horizontal slit in his nether\r\nlip (a custom of his people) through which he could loll his tongue\r\nat pleasure.  This unusual aperture was so large as to give him the\r\nappearance of having two mouths; thus, when he grinned, the white\r\nteeth appeared at the upper, and the red cruel tongue through the\r\nlower.  He wore long splints of wood through the lobes of his ears;\r\none eye had a fiery red circle painted round it, the other a yellow.\r\nHe wore the skin of an ape in front like an apron; and this, with a\r\npair of sandals, formed of elephant hide, completed his attire.  His\r\nweapons were a long asseguy of tough teak wood, having a point of\r\niron; and a short sword of iron, curiously fashioned, with a great\r\nleathern tassel at the end of the sheath, hung on his left side.\r\n\r\nBehind him a savage held the bridle of his dromedary, which was\r\ncovered by a multiplicity of barbaric trappings.\r\n\r\n\"It is the law of Empungua,\" said the King, \"that he who slays a man\r\nshall have a public trial in face of the tribe; and if he cannot\r\njustify the act, he and all his adherents are doomed to die.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then,\" replied Baylis, \"I demand justice on those who slew two of my\r\nmen, and plundered our boat.\"\r\n\r\n\"But how know we not that one or both killed the fetisher, who was at\r\nworship in the Wood of the Devil?\" demanded the King, with a dreadful\r\nexpression in his yellow eyeballs.\r\n\r\n\"Ya--ya--ya--yah!\" chorused the tribe.\r\n\r\n\"I swear to you that we know nothing of the act you mention,\" replied\r\nBaylis, with great earnestness.\r\n\r\n\"The white men are liars!\"\r\n\r\n\"If we had known, or been guilty of it, would we have ventured ashore\r\nto trade or barter with you like brothers?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes; because the white men are all liars!\"\r\n\r\n\"It was done by the ship of another nation.\"\r\n\r\n\"All the white men belong to one tribe, and one big canoe is very\r\nlike another.  You are liars who come over the Sea of Darkness.\"*\r\n\r\n\r\n* The Atlantic.\r\n\r\n\r\nBaylis, on finding that all his assertions of innocence met with\r\nutter disbelief, bent all his energy to bribe our release; but his\r\nsable Majesty only grinned through _both_ his horrid mouths, and\r\nsaid--\r\n\r\n\"Enough! the King of the Snake River will keep what he has got,\r\nwithout trusting to getting more.  The white men are false.  Who of\r\nmy people would venture to your ship when we know now what we never\r\nknew before?\"\r\n\r\n\"And what is this?\"\r\n\r\n\"Accursed dog and son of a race of dogs!\" thundered the King,\r\nspitting a quid of something like beetel-nut full in the face of\r\nBaylis; \"we have learned that you white men take our people away in\r\nshiploads to fatten them for food, in a land far beyond the sea!\"\r\n\r\nOn this, a yell similar to that we had first heard made wood and\r\nwelkin ring.  Violent hands were again laid on us, and we expected\r\ninstant immolation; but their purpose at present was merely to denude\r\nus more fully of anything we had about us.\r\n\r\nOn having his shirt torn from him, poor Hartly endeavoured to protect\r\nor conceal a little gold locket, which contained the hair of his dead\r\nwife and of their little ones, and which was hung at his neck by a\r\nblack silk riband.  But he received a blow from a carved war-club\r\nwhich covered his face with blood; he reeled backward, and the prized\r\nrelic was instantly appropriated by the King, who, no doubt, deemed\r\nit the white man's fetish, a \"great medicine,\" or amulet.\r\n\r\nMrs. Baylis became insensible, and was delivered over to a crowd of\r\nwomen, who shouted and laughed like devils as they bore her into a\r\nwigwam, while her husband, Hartly, six seamen, and I, were, by the\r\nKing's order, conducted through the town of huts, and driven like a\r\nherd towards the summit of a high mountain, where we fully expected\r\nto be put to death in some barbarous fashion.\r\n\r\nMounted on his dromedary, the King accompanied his savages, one of\r\nwhom, brilliantly smeared over with ochre, was an esquire of the\r\nroyal body, I presume, as he sat behind, and held outspread a broad\r\numbrella of grass matting.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XL.\r\n\r\nTHE GABON CLIFF.\r\n\r\nA sad series of barbarities, suffering, danger, and death make up the\r\nremainder of my story.\r\n\r\nWe were in the hands of a tribe addicted to fetishism of the lowest\r\nkind.  Worse than the ferocious Bisagos, who pay divine homage to a\r\ndunghill cock, or the people of Benin, who worship their own shadows,\r\nthey adored the devil and all snakes, from the little adder to the\r\ngreat cobra-capello, and maintained temples and priests in their\r\nhonour; remaining, in this age of steam, gas, and electricity, as\r\nignorant as the people mentioned by Ælian, who worshipped flies, and\r\noffered up full-fed oxen on their shrines!\r\n\r\nAmid a yelling horde, who, by their menacing tones, seemed full of\r\nanimosity, and no doubt were pouring upon us their whole vocabulary\r\nof abuse, though we understood it not, we were led up the steep rough\r\nslope of a mountain, which rose at a very sharp angle to a great\r\nheight.  The side on which we ascended was covered with loose stones,\r\namid which the wild coffee and tobacco plants, with innumerable\r\nthorny trees--the _persea_ of Theophrastus--grew in tangled masses,\r\nwith serrated grass, having blades as sharp as knives, with many a\r\nnameless bramble that tore our tender skins, while gnats came upon us\r\nin swarms, and well-nigh drove us mad; and all this we endured, while\r\nthe well-armed crew of the _Princess_, in ignorance of our fate, were\r\nwithin a few miles of us!\r\n\r\nOn reaching what we supposed to be the summit of a mountain, we found\r\nourselves upon a green plateau that terminated abruptly in a\r\nprecipitous cliff nearly four hundred feet in height, and overhanging\r\nsome rocky shelves, which sloped down to the bed of the Gabon River.\r\n\r\nHere the King dismounted from his dromedary, and squatted his sable\r\nperson on a piece of grass matting under the royal umbrella, while\r\nseveral of his chief men seated themselves at a respectful distance,\r\nafter knocking their woolly heads upon the earth, in token of their\r\nslavish submission.\r\n\r\nFrom the brow of this cliff we could see our ship at anchor in the\r\nestuary, but alas! far beyond the reach of signals.  We could also\r\nsee the little green Pongos, which stud the bay formed by the great\r\nsweep of the Gabon.\r\n\r\nAfar off on the other hand towards the east, we could discern where,\r\nbetween groves of strange trees--the plantain, banana, and the\r\nbaobab--with many a giant plant and mighty flower upon its shores,\r\nthe great river of Guinea, the Rio Gabon, rolled from its distant\r\nsource, in the unexplored land of Ungobai--a stream so broad and deep\r\nthat a sloop of war has ascended it for more than seventy miles.\r\n\r\nTransparent though the air was around us, a hot sunny haze shrouded\r\nthose green forests through which the Gabon came rolling like a\r\nmighty flood of gold towards the west--rolling through a vast plain,\r\ncovered by a leafy wilderness, where the lordly lion with his shaggy\r\nmane, the cruel panther with his stealthy step, and the ponderous\r\nelephant, roved in herds; and amid the luxuriant flowers and lovely\r\nfertility of which, the scaly cobra-capello, and a hundred kinds of\r\ndreadful reptiles, with tongues that teemed with poison, lurked;\r\nwhere every fruit and herb were gigantic in proportion to the mighty\r\ncontinent which produced them; where the crocodile squattered in the\r\ngreen miasmatic slime, and the hippopotami, huge, misshapen, and\r\npre-Adamite in form, swam like the great tusky walrus of the icy\r\nregions I had left so recently.\r\n\r\nAll these natural wonders were contained in the vast plain at our\r\nfeet--a plain that seemed to vibrate under the cloudless glare of the\r\nburning sun; for the heat at noon must have been somewhere about 107°\r\nin the shade, and our tender skins were blistering under it.\r\n\r\nBut the thoughts this scene inspired for a moment were soon diverted\r\nfrom it, by the terrors about to be enacted there.\r\n\r\nA hideous old negro, whose barbaric ornaments announced his rank and\r\ncharacter as a _fetisher_, proceeded to examine, with gipsy-like\r\ncare, the various lines on the palms of our hands.\r\n\r\nWhat he affected to gather therefrom we could not divine, but the\r\nlines proved fatal to three of our companions, whom, with yells of\r\nsatisfaction, he thrust aside from the rest, and the work of torture\r\nand death at once began by order of the King.\r\n\r\nThree strong and handsome young seamen had their hands tied behind\r\nthem by a thick thong.\r\n\r\nTo this a rope was attached; after this they were thrust over the\r\ncliff, and a piercing cry, which curdled the blood in our hearts,\r\nburst from each, when, by the violence of the jerk and their own\r\nweight, their arms were torn round and upward, and dislocated in the\r\nshoulder socket.\r\n\r\nIn this horrible situation they swung at the extremity of the\r\nsuspending lines, which were made fast to the roots of a palm-tree;\r\nand there with a pendulous motion, they swayed to and fro in mid-air,\r\nover the sharp edge of that impending cliff, with the rocky bank of\r\nthe Gabon four hundred feet below.\r\n\r\nNeed I say their shrieks and cries for pity were piercing and\r\nunheeded?\r\n\r\nUnable to yield them the slightest assistance, we gazed in speechless\r\nhorror; while, as their strength waned, their sad moans arose from\r\ntime to time to the plateau on which we stood.\r\n\r\nThe hungry cormorants, in anticipation of their coming repast, came\r\nout of their holes in the cliff, and with flapping wings, wheeled and\r\nswooped up and down about them.\r\n\r\nTo protract the mental and bodily agony endured by these poor\r\nfellows, they were permitted to hang thus for nearly half an hour,\r\nwhen the King gave a signal, and a score of tum-tums, or drums, were\r\nbeaten.  On this, the cords were parted by three blows of a sharp\r\nhatchet, then the bodies of our companions fell whizzing through the\r\nair, and vanished from sight far down below, where no doubt the river\r\ncrocodiles, the greedy cormorants, and the wild ducks would soon rend\r\ntheir poor corses asunder.\r\n\r\nSo perished these unfortunates!\r\n\r\nWe looked into each other's haggard eyes with blank dismay; and it\r\nmay readily be supposed that such an episode made us still more\r\nspiritless and timid.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, my wife! my poor wife!\" exclaimed the unfortunate Baylis from\r\ntime to time.  \"Death is but the birthday of _another_ life, the\r\nparsons tell us; but I think with horror of her fate among such\r\ncowardly dogs as these.  God help her!  God help her!\"\r\n\r\nA series of prolonged and exulting yells now announced that our\r\ncaptors conceived they had appeased the spirit of the fetisher whom\r\nthe Yankees had slain.\r\n\r\n\"Let them die! let them die!\" (Baylis told me were their shouts;)\r\n\"they are but white dogs who worship neither the sun nor moon, nor\r\nthe big snake that lives in the wood.\"\r\n\r\nThere were now but six of us remaining, and our fate was soon\r\ndecided.  The King selected Hartly and Baylis as slaves for himself,\r\nassigning the four others to different chief men of his town or\r\nterritory.\r\n\r\n\"My poor friend,\" said Hartly, \"this is from bad to worse!  Why did\r\nwe not perish with the _Leda_?  We shall never weather these fellows,\r\nI fear!\"\r\n\r\nI fell to the lot of the savage with the coin at his neck, a\r\npersonage whom they named Amoo--the same supple fellow who had first\r\npounced upon me when we landed in that fiendish country.\r\n\r\nAs we were separated, Hartly and I had only time to exchange a\r\nfarewell glance.  My hands were still secured by the thong, which was\r\ntied so tightly that the flesh of my wrists was becoming blue, livid,\r\nand swollen almost to bursting, so my aching arms were powerless.  By\r\nblows with the shaft of his asseguy, Amoo drove me down the hill, and\r\nconducted me to his wigwam, when the tribe separated, and save on one\r\noccasion I never again saw any of my poor companions in misfortune;\r\nthough I afterwards learned the miserable fate of Captain Baylis and\r\nhis wife.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLI.\r\n\r\nHOW THE CAPTAIN PERISHED.\r\n\r\nI have mentioned that the gentle Mrs. Baylis--she who had nursed us\r\nso kindly in our helplessness--had been carried off by the women of\r\nthis tribe of devils, who confined her in a wigwam.\r\n\r\nOn perceiving the whiteness of her skin, and the great length and\r\nsoftness of her hair, which was of a fair auburn colour, forming thus\r\na strange contrast to their sooty exteriors, and the short,\r\npoodledog-like tufts of wool with which their own round skulls were\r\ncovered, they diligently proceeded to make her as like themselves as\r\npossible.\r\n\r\nA species of gum and certain herbs were boiled in an earthen pipkin,\r\nand with this decoction they rubbed her whole face and body, until\r\nthey became black as ebony.\r\n\r\nThey next rooted out the whole of her soft and beautiful hair, making\r\nher perfectly bald.  Her head was then smeared thickly with gum, and\r\ncoated over with green and crimson parrot's feathers.  They then\r\nstreaked her breast and shoulders with red and yellow paint.  This\r\nprocess occupied two entire days, during which she remained a passive\r\nvictim in their hands, and at the close--when these ladies of the Rio\r\nSerpientes thought they had made the unhappy woman as fiendish in\r\naspect and as like themselves as possible--they placed a kind of hoe\r\nin her hands and dragged her into a plantation of millet to work with\r\nthem; as the naked warriors and lazy husbands of Gabon, like those of\r\nother savage districts, disdainfully leave all manual labour to their\r\nslavish helpmates.\r\n\r\nDespair and exhaustion rendered Mrs. Baylis unable to work; so the\r\nnegresses beat, scratched, and bit her, till she sank under their\r\nhands at the root of a date-tree, where she lay inert and reckless\r\nalike of life and death; but the horrid hiss of a serpent close by,\r\naroused her.\r\n\r\nSo great is the instinctive love of life, that on beholding this\r\nhideous reptile, which was of the venomous kind and some six or eight\r\nfeet long, rearing its head to attack her, she uttered a shrill and\r\npiercing cry for aid.\r\n\r\nTwo white prisoners who had been hewing wood in an adjacent thicket\r\ncame forth on hearing this; but the negresses, who laughed and danced\r\non seeing the poor woman assailed by one of their holy snakes, met\r\nthe two men with their hoes in a hostile attitude, and barred their\r\nadvance to a rescue: while the white men, conceiving the shrieking\r\nvictim to be a mere savage--so darkly was the skin of Mrs. Baylis\r\ndyed by the decoctions of her tormentors--were not over anxious to\r\ninterfere.\r\n\r\nIn one of these white prisoners, worn to a skeleton, haggard in eye,\r\nand covered with sores and bloody bruises, she had nearly as much\r\ndifficulty in recognising her husband, the once plump and jolly\r\ncaptain of the _Princess_, as he had, in tracing in the face of that\r\ndusky and copper-coloured squaw, with her gummed wig of red and green\r\nparrot's feathers, his pretty English wife, with her once snowy skin\r\nand silky auburn hair; but she cried aloud,\r\n\r\n\"Save me, Baylis--Oh, save me!  I am your poor wife, your own Annie!\"\r\n\r\nThe unfortunate Baylis trembled with mingled rage and horror, and\r\nsnatching a hoe from a negress rushed upon the poisonous serpent,\r\nwhich had already bitten its victim thrice, and beat it furiously\r\nupon its flat head and scaly body; but while doing so, the frantic\r\ncries of the negresses, who deemed this an act of sacrilege, brought\r\nto the spot Amoo, with a crowd of savages, one of whom pierced Baylis\r\nthrough the heart with his asseguy, and mercifully slew him on the\r\ninstant.\r\n\r\nThe negresses then rushed upon his wife, and by repeated blows of\r\ntheir implements upon her head, face, and bosom, soon ended her\r\nmiseries.\r\n\r\nOn beholding this scene of double barbarity, the seaman who had been\r\nat work with Baylis, and who, like him, was also a mass of sores and\r\nbruises by the ill-usage he had undergone, became filled by a species\r\nof frenzy.  Wresting an asseguy from Amoo, he ran three of his\r\nfollowers through the body in quick succession, and killed, or\r\nmortally wounded them, as all these weapons are poisoned; but he was\r\nsoon overpowered by numbers, beaten down, secured, and condemned to\r\ndeath by tortures, almost too horrible for narration.\r\n\r\nHis eyes, mouth, and nostrils were forced open and filled with hot\r\npepper.  He was then enclosed in a strong basket of cylindrical form,\r\nfull of long sharp thorns, and this was rolled for hours about the\r\ntown of wigwams, until he became a shapeless mass of flesh and blood,\r\nwhich dropped through the wattling of the cage; and during this\r\ndreadful torture, under which he must soon have perished, if he\r\nuttered cries they were unheard, as they were unheeded, for the\r\nwhooping, yelling, and beating of tum-tums, might have made one\r\nsuppose that Pandemonium had vomited all its denizens on the bank of\r\nthe Gabon River.\r\n\r\nWhile this was going on, I was at work among the plants which grew in\r\na patch of ground adjoining the wigwam of Amoo; but I could in no way\r\ndiscover _who_ this last victim was.  However, as Baylis and Hartly\r\nhad been condemned to slavery together, I was full of deep sorrow\r\nlest the sufferer might be my friend.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLII.\r\n\r\nAMOO.\r\n\r\nAmoo, the savage who wore the amulet or coin at his neck, proved to\r\nbe the King's brother; and when first dragged to his miserable\r\ndwelling he informed me, by signs--pointing to the earth which I was\r\nto till, and to the trees which I was to hew--that I was to be his\r\nobedient servant or slave, and by placing the poisoned point of his\r\nasseguy in dangerous proximity to my throat, he menacingly indicated\r\nthat death would be the result of the least attempt at resistance or\r\nescape.\r\n\r\nI understood his grim pantomime in all its terrible minutiæ; but in\r\nno way daunted thereby, resolved, whatever froward fate might have in\r\nstore for me, to leave no means untried to fly his thraldom and reach\r\nthe coast, in the hope of escaping to any vessel that might come in\r\nsight, or anchor off the Pongos on the same unfortunate errand as the\r\n_Princess_.\r\n\r\nI could no longer hope that she was still there, as the chief mate,\r\nafter the lapse of a week, would suppose we were all murdered, and so\r\ncontinue his voyage to the Cape of Good Hope.\r\n\r\nAmoo, though savage and exacting in the tasks he set me, was nothing\r\nin severity when compared to his wife, for this Brave of the Rio\r\nSerpientes had \"a helpmate meet for him,\" who hoed his rice and\r\nmaize, shared his matted hut and couch of skins, and who scraped in\r\nthankful silence what he was pleased to leave her after meals at the\r\nbottom of his calibash; who shared with the house-dog his half-picked\r\nbones, and nursed a frightful little imp about a month old.  They had\r\nthree others, and Amoo doubtless fondly hoped (to quote Ossian) \"they\r\nwould carry his name and fame to future times.\"\r\n\r\nBy an anomaly in savage life, Amoo was very much attached to his four\r\nchildren, while their mother was tolerably indifferent about them,\r\nand often forced me to carry her black bantling, which I did, with an\r\nexhibition of all the solicitude I could assume, and with as little\r\ndisgust as possible, conceiving that if her good will and confidence\r\ncould be won, they might improve my chances of escape; but I strove\r\nin vain, and might as well have caudled the cub of a she-bear.\r\n\r\nMy mistress was a negress of Guinea, and of unusually horrible\r\naspect.  Her lower lip was slit, and had a long wooden peg inserted\r\nin it so curiously, that the end thereof dangled upon her breast.\r\nHer great ears, set high upon her woolly head, had ponderous rings of\r\nmetal, which dragged them downward to her shoulders.  Her teeth were\r\ndyed blood red by some native herb, known to the fetishers alone, and\r\nher whole body, where revealed by her only garment--an apron of grass\r\nmatting--was covered with a species of tattooing, and always smeared\r\nwith a thick unctuous grease, in which the embedded gnats and flies\r\ncould revel undisturbed.\r\n\r\nTo eat repasts which were cooked by her odious hands excited a\r\nloathing which hunger alone could conquer; but anxiety for the\r\nfuture, and the intense heat of the atmosphere, made me generally\r\naverse to animal food; hence I found the yams, which there grow like\r\nturnips (and shoot out long leaves like French beans), my most\r\npleasant food, as I could cook them for myself, either by boiling\r\nthem in a pipkin, or roasting them among cinders.  The inside is\r\nwhite as flour, and sweet and dry.\r\n\r\nFor many days I lived on these, with such fruit as I could find when\r\nat work near our wigwam, and Amoo gave me at times a little olive oil\r\nand palm wine, but in secret, for this warrior, though fearless in\r\nother respects, was civilized enough to be afraid of his wife.\r\n\r\nMy days were spent in hoeing yams, cutting fuel, carrying water in\r\ncalibashes, selecting long and straight reeds for baskets, or boughs\r\nand bark to keep the wigwam water-tight.  My mistress would have had\r\nme dive into the bay in search of sea-eggs, but to this I would by no\r\nmeans consent, and my refusal caused an open and standing feud\r\nbetween us.\r\n\r\nAt night, in a corner of their wretched dwelling, I coiled myself up\r\non a panther skin, and for hours would lie awake in the dark,\r\nrevolving plans of escape.  To push a passage through the wattles,\r\nand make off under cloud of night, would have been an easy task,\r\ncould I have silenced or circumvented the herd of ferocious dogs\r\nwhich guarded the town, or rather village, after sunset, and the\r\nyells of which, on the slightest movement, raised an alarm that would\r\nsoon cause their being unleashed and let slip upon my track.\r\n\r\nThe negroes among whom I was cast worshipped the sun, the moon, and\r\nthe devil; and in many instances, with singular barbarity, offered up\r\ntheir youngest children to the latter, that rain might fall in due\r\nseason to make the yams big and the bananas grow.\r\n\r\nAmoo strove in vain to lessen the severity of his wife, who\r\nfrequently beat me with a hard club, till I grew weary of existence,\r\nand my heart swelled with savage thoughts of revenge.\r\n\r\nAmong the glass beads, feathers, rusty nails, and other trash which\r\nAmoo wore as a necklace, was his great amulet, a curious coin, which\r\nhe one day permitted me to examine, but which he would have yielded\r\nup less readily than his life.\r\n\r\nIt proved to be a piece of the reign of Servius Tullius, sixth King\r\nof the Romans, and consequently must have been more than twenty-three\r\ncenturies old.  How came it there, and what was its history?  So this\r\nprize, which half the savans of Europe would have rejoiced to\r\npossess, hung, and, for aught that I know, still hangs at the neck of\r\nan African savage, who found it on the sea-shore.\r\n\r\nIt was several ounces in weight, and bore on one side the head of\r\nMinerva, on the other an ox, as plain as if struck yesterday; and\r\naccoutred with this \"great medicine,\" Amoo rushed fearlessly to\r\nencounter alike human enemies and the wild beasts of the forests\r\nwhich bordered the Gabon and the River of Snakes.\r\n\r\nIn the course of three weeks I picked up several words of the native\r\nlanguage, which is full of rather musical sounds, as most of the\r\nwords end in a vowel.  The desire for escape added to the care with\r\nwhich I studied it.\r\n\r\nOne day when Amoo, with other savages, was hunting in the forest, and\r\nhis better half was paddling about in her canoe on the river fishing,\r\nshe suddenly uttered a shrill yell, which arrested me at my work\r\namong the yams, where I was hoeing under a broiling sun.\r\n\r\nShe was only about forty yards from me, and was pointing frantically\r\nto a huge baboon, which had squatted itself close by where her\r\nyoungest child was asleep, under two large plantain leaves, the stems\r\nof which had been stuck in the turf as a species of sun-shade.\r\n\r\nThe baboon was of the ursine species, larger than a Newfoundland dog,\r\nand though common enough in South Africa, I now beheld it for the\r\nfirst time.  It was a hideous brute, covered with shaggy brown hair,\r\nexcept on the hind feet and hands, for its forepaws are literally\r\n_hands_, and bare as a man's, being constantly employed in climbing\r\nrocks and trees, pulling fruit, or grubbing up roots and esculents\r\nfor food.  Its head resembled that of a dog, but its hind feet were\r\nrather human in form.\r\n\r\nThese baboons are so strong and bold, that they will attack a leopard\r\nor hyæna, and by their teeth, which are an inch-and-a-half long, and\r\ntheir sharp fore-claws, can rend the throat and jugular vein with\r\nferocious dexterity.\r\n\r\nThe woman uttered yell after yell, and pointing to her nursling with\r\none hand, paddled vigorously towards the shore with the other, while\r\nI gazed at her with irresolution; thus, before either of us could\r\ncome to the rescue, the grisly she-baboon had snatched it up and\r\nbounded into the forest!\r\n\r\nThough I had no great love for the tribe of the Rio Serpientes, the\r\nnatural impulses of humanity, together with a dread of the vengeance\r\nthat might fall upon me for neglect, caused me instantly to rush away\r\nin pursuit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLIII.\r\n\r\nTHE RESCUE OF HIS CHILD.\r\n\r\nSome time before this, I had fortunately made for myself a pair of\r\nlong sandals, formed of panther's skin, which I wore as Bryan O'Lynn\r\ndid his breeches--\r\n\r\n  \"With the skinny side out and the hairy side in.\"\r\n\r\nIndeed these, and a kind of shirt of grass-matting, were all the\r\ngarments I possessed; for the savages, on our capture, tore all our\r\nclothes into strips, that each might have a portion; thus, every coin\r\nand button found upon us were appropriated; even our watches were\r\nbroken up, and the wheels and springs of them were worn in their\r\nnoses and ears as ornaments.\r\n\r\nThese sandals enabled me to run with ease and safety through patches\r\nof prickly yams, among serrated blades of grass, wild vines, dense\r\ncreepers, and all kinds of thorny bushes.\r\n\r\nTwo warriors, on hearing the alarm, joined me in the pursuit.  One\r\nsoon passed me, but went upon a false trail; the other stumbled and\r\nhurt himself severely; so relinquishing my wooden hoe for his\r\nasseguy, I continued the pursuit alone.\r\n\r\nEncumbered by her prey, the baboon could only run upon her hind legs,\r\nthus I easily kept her in sight after seeing her again.  She was\r\nmaking straight towards those steep and lofty rocks which overhang\r\nthe Gabon river--the same fatal rocks where three of our boat's crew\r\nhad perished so miserably.\r\n\r\nBut her progress was soon impeded by a wall of gigantic reeds about\r\nten feet high, through which a passage seemed impossible, as they\r\ngrew close and dense amid a deep miasmatic quagmire, which covered\r\nall the plain at the base of the rocks, and amid which myriads of\r\nwater-snakes lurked, and poisonous reptiles squattered.  Here, too,\r\nthere was no air--not a breath could be inhaled with freedom, for the\r\ndensity of the reeds obstructed every passing current; and, gasping\r\nand bathed in perspiration, as I drew near the savage animal she\r\nturned, and was about to make a hostile, and perhaps most fatal\r\nspring, in which case all had ended with me then; when suddenly\r\nperceiving a narrow opening in the reedy wall, she changed her\r\nintention, and entering, again vanished with the child.\r\n\r\nFurther pursuit seemed impossible!\r\n\r\nI sank under a tree, and for some time fanned myself with a large\r\nleaf.  While thus employed, I heard a strange railing cry at a\r\ndistance, and on looking round perceived the baboon, about a hundred\r\nyards off, clambering up the face of the rocks, where it entered a\r\nhole, and disappeared.\r\n\r\nThough I could scarcely hope that the child of Amoo would be alive or\r\nundevoured, I marked well the locality of the crevice its captor had\r\nentered, and making a detour, reached the end of the reedy marsh, and\r\nthen proceeded boldly to ascend the rocks.\r\n\r\nIn some parts the climbing convolvoli and papyrus grew in such\r\nmasses, and were so interlaced, as to form a rampart, against which I\r\ntoiled in despair, and had my skin torn in innumerable places, ere I\r\ncould burst through them.  One feels so helpless without clothing.\r\n\r\nAt last I reached the vicinity of the hole, and after pausing for a\r\ntime to recover breath, advanced with the asseguy charged breast\r\nhigh, lest the fierce brute might spring forth upon me; but on\r\npeering into the den, I saw its eyes glancing, and its grim\r\nsatyr-like visage grinning at me, while uttering a hoarse cry.\r\n\r\nThe infant was alive, and its captor was kindly fondling it; having\r\nbeen probably deprived of her own offspring by some hunter's shaft,\r\nthe act of abduction had been prompted by a strange and erratic\r\nmaternal emotion in herself.\r\n\r\nAmoo explained this to me afterwards as being no uncommon occurrence.\r\nI had no thought of it then, but rushed upon her with the long and\r\nsharp asseguy, and thrust it deeply into her breast.  Coiled up in\r\nher little den, and thus rendered incapable of active resistance, she\r\ncould only howl, bite, and writhe upon the tough teakwood shaft;\r\nwhile her life-blood smeared all the little black infant, and ebbed\r\naway among the well-picked bones of the small monkeys and wild ducks,\r\nwhich strewed the hole that formed her lair.\r\n\r\nThe poor baboon expired just as I drew forth the asseguy for a\r\nfinishing thrust; and at that moment Amoo, with a crowd of other\r\nsavages, came rushing up the rocks, and joined me, with excitement\r\nexpressed in all their wide mouths and glittering eyeballs.\r\n\r\nBreathless and drenched in perspiration, overcome by exertion, and\r\nsomewhat sickened by the cries and death agonies of the half\r\nhuman-like creature I had slain, I sank upon a bank of turf,\r\nincapable of further exertion.\r\n\r\nAmoo, after holding up his offspring by each leg alternately, and\r\nviewing it over as one might do a dead duck or rabbit, to ascertain\r\nif any of its bones were broken, found that it had suffered only a\r\nfew scratches, on which he uttered sundry shrill howls expressive of\r\npaternal satisfaction, and patted me kindly on the head and breast,\r\nin token that henceforth we were friends, and in amity.\r\n\r\n\"You are brave--you are brave!  Yah--yah!\" said he repeatedly.  \"You\r\nare the brother of Amoo.\"\r\n\r\nThus did I achieve the very end I had in view--to win the confidence\r\nof my savage task-masters!\r\n\r\nWe returned to the wigwams in triumph, bringing with us the skin of\r\nthe ursine baboon on the point of an asseguy; and the circumstance of\r\na creature so agile and ferocious having been slain by me, the poor\r\ndespised white slave, was evidently the cause of much marvel to that\r\ndingy community.\r\n\r\nFrom this day there was a sensible alteration in the bearing of my\r\nmistress towards me.  I cannot say that I gained more of her\r\nconfidence, or had fewer tasks set me, but when beating me with her\r\nclub, she entirely ceased to strike me on _the head_ or face, as she\r\nhad been wont to do.  But the reason of this unusual forbearance was\r\nexplained to me by Amoo, and proved a very cogent reason for\r\nhastening my departure from the unpleasant vicinity of the Snake\r\nRiver.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLIV.\r\n\r\nTHE GRATITUDE OF HIS WIFE.\r\n\r\nIn two instances she patted my head and smiled on me, till the\r\ncorners of her mouth went up to her ears.\r\n\r\nOn the last occasion she gave me a large iron knife to sharpen,\r\nindicating by various signs that a very fine edge must be put upon it.\r\n\r\n\"She is grateful to you for saving her child,\" said Amoo, who\r\nobserved her.\r\n\r\n\"I am glad of it,\" said I, with a sigh of mingled bitterness and\r\nimpatience.\r\n\r\n\"She means to show you and the tribe that she is so.\"\r\n\r\n\"The tribe too, how?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yah, yah,\" said Amoo, as he placed one hand on my head, and drew the\r\nright forefinger of the other across his throat, in a way that was\r\nunpleasantly suggestive.  Then he laughed and pointed to a gaily\r\npainted canoe that lay among some reeds by the river-side.\r\n\r\n\"She will assist me to escape in it to a big ship at the Pongos?\"\r\nsaid I with a glow of hope.\r\n\r\nAmoo frowned, then he grinned and shook his head.\r\n\r\n\"What then?\" I asked anxiously.\r\n\r\nAfter a good deal of pantomime, with which he endeavoured to aid his\r\nexplanations, at last the horrid truth broke upon me!\r\n\r\nShe wished my caput as a figure-head to her canoe, for which purpose,\r\nafter being duly prepared by gums, balms, and herbs, she could make\r\nit suitable.  Amoo flatteringly added that such had been her desire\r\nfrom the first, as \"I was the youngest and best-looking of the\r\nprisoners.\"\r\n\r\nHere was a pleasant prospect!\r\n\r\n\"And it was for this purpose she gave me the long knife to sharpen so\r\ncarefully?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yah, yah,\" replied Amoo, while a glow of rage filled my breast; \"and\r\neven now she is gathering herbs on the borders of the wood to boil in\r\nthe stone jar with it.\"\r\n\r\n\"It--what?\"\r\n\r\n\"Your head.\"\r\n\r\n\"I must watch.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is of no use to watch,\" replied Amoo; \"sometime, when you are not\r\nthinking of it, she will give you some red berries, that will cause\r\nyou to sleep _very sound_; and then with her knife or a sharp\r\nshell--yah, yah!\" he concluded by a guttural laugh, and again pressed\r\nhis finger round his neck.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Heavens!\" I exclaimed, \"aid me to escape from this atrocious\r\nsquaw!\"\r\n\r\nI asked Amoo if he, in gratitude to me for saving his child, would\r\naid me to escape; but he shook his head, adding:\r\n\r\n\"I am the brother of a great king, and must keep my slave.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why?\"\r\n\r\n\"To punish the white men, who fatten up our brothers beyond the Sea\r\nof Darkness, and eat them.\"\r\n\r\nAfter reiterated applications to his gratitude and pity for freedom\r\nor assistance, finding that he was gradually losing his temper and\r\nbecoming suspicious; that his snake-like eyes were beginning to gleam\r\nand his thick red nostrils to quiver, I abandoned the subject, and\r\nresuming my hoe, went to my daily task in the patch of garden where\r\nour yams and other esculents grew, and affected to work as usual,\r\nconscious that, for a time, my savage owner was eyeing me with vague\r\ndoubts, and while playing ominously with his long reed-like asseguy,\r\nwas probably repenting that by his admissions he had put me on my\r\nguard against the artistic views of his better half.\r\n\r\nAfter a time he disappeared, yet I dreaded that it was only to\r\nconceal himself under some of the bushes, or the leaves of the\r\ncreeping gourds, to watch me, so I affected to hoe\r\nindustriously--yes, and to whistle too, though my heart was sick and\r\nfull of dreadful apprehensions.  One thing I had resolved, come what\r\nmight, never again to commit my head to sleep, or to pass a night\r\nwithin the same wigwam with that horrible woman.\r\n\r\nWhile revolving in my mind, and almost blind with desperation, what\r\nmeasures I should take to save myself, to escape from my present\r\ndanger and misery, I saw her pass from the wood towards the town of\r\nwigwams.  In one hand she held the knife I had sharpened so nicely\r\nfor her, in the other a basket filled with herbs--herbs, I doubted\r\nnot, for my especial behoof; and she \"grinned horribly a ghastly\r\nsmile,\" as she walked on with that shuffling gait peculiar to these\r\nnegresses.\r\n\r\nMy heart swelled with so much rage and hatred at this hideous\r\ncreature, that I had some difficulty in repressing a vehement desire\r\nto beat her down with my hoe; but such a proceeding would only have\r\nensured and accelerated my own destruction; as I knew not what number\r\nof watchful savages might at that moment be eyeing me from amid the\r\njungle of leaves, flowers, and fruit which bordered the patch wherein\r\nI worked, under a sun so vertical that I had scarcely a shadow.\r\n\r\nLest such a surveillance might be maintained, I resolved as soon as\r\nshe disappeared to adopt something of their own subtlety.\r\n\r\nI seated myself under a tree among some weeds, as if tired, and then,\r\nafter a time, affected to sleep; though keeping watch with open ears\r\nand half-closed eyes, lest any one might approach; but all remained\r\nstill around me, save the monotonous hum of the millions of insects\r\nthat revolved in the shade of the adjacent wood.\r\n\r\nOn being assured of this, I crept on my hands and knees into the\r\njungle, dragging my hoe after me, and going feet foremost on my face\r\nfor nearly a hundred yards or so, that I might with my fingers\r\nobliterate all traces of a _trail_; and in this, I was very\r\nsuccessful by raising the crushed grass and shaking the bruised twigs.\r\n\r\nAt last I reached a runnel, the waters of which I knew would destroy\r\nall scent of my footsteps, and baffle the keen nostrils of those\r\nferocious dogs, which would certainly be let slip in search of me the\r\nmoment I was missed.\r\n\r\nAssured that this runnel of water would be a tributary of the Rio\r\nSerpientes, I proceeded up its course for several miles, and in my\r\nanxiety to escape the human race forgetting all about the ferocious\r\ndenizens of the African forest--the snakes and other dreadful\r\nreptiles with which the woods, the water, and the bordering deserts\r\nteemed.\r\n\r\nI must have proceeded about ten miles without meeting either man or\r\nbeast to molest or obstruct me, when evening was beginning to close,\r\nand I found myself nearly exhausted, but within a pleasant thicket of\r\norange, citron, and chestnut trees, which bordered a pretty lake, and\r\nflourished amid the thousand flowering shrubs of this luxuriant\r\nwilderness.\r\n\r\nThe necessity for rest forced itself upon me; but I dared not sleep\r\non the earth lest snakes might assail me, and even in a tree I was\r\nnot safe from the panthers, yet I chose my couch in the latter.\r\nFurnished with a large stone, as a missile for defence in any\r\nemergency, grasping the hoe by my teeth, I clambered into a\r\nchestnut-tree, scaring therefrom a whole covey of kingfishers,\r\ncopper-coloured cuckoos, and green and flame-coloured parrots.\r\n\r\nThen selecting a place where the leafy branches were forked out from\r\nthe stem, and grew in such a form that I could rest upon them with\r\nease, and without fear of falling, I deposited the stone in a hollow\r\nof the tree, and after an hour of anxious and exciting watchfulness,\r\ngradually felt sleep stealing over me--a sleep to which the \"drowsy\r\nhum\" of the insects, the balmy air of the evening, the lassitude\r\nproduced by my recent travel after a day's toil under a burning sun,\r\nall conduced; and so, heedless of everything, at last I slept\r\nprofoundly on my awkward perch.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLV.\r\n\r\nFLIGHT.\r\n\r\nIn this precarious situation I must have been asleep for some hours,\r\nwhen awakened by a dreadful sound, and with a start so nervous that I\r\nnearly fell from my roost upon the long, reedy grass below.\r\n\r\nThis sound was the roaring of a lion!\r\n\r\nI had heard it often in menageries at home; but there the sound was\r\nfeeble as the bay of a house-dog when compared to the dread roar,\r\nwhich rolled along the ground and rent the still air of the morning\r\nin that lone African forest.  A terror possessed me; yet, grasping my\r\nhoe, while quivering in every fibre, I gazed with keen anxiety\r\nbetween the leaves of the chestnut-tree for the approaching enemy.\r\n\r\nIgnorant alike of his powers of leaping and scenting, I knew not\r\nwhether the lion might, on discovering me, at once spring up like a\r\ntree-leopard, which can pursue its prey, like a cat, from branch to\r\nbranch.  Oh, how I longed for a good rifle--a sharp sword--a\r\ndagger--for any other weapon than the miserable wooden club (for the\r\nhoe was no better) with which I was armed at that moment.\r\n\r\nThe lilac light of dawning morn poured through the thick green vista\r\nof the wild forest, and the little lake which lay near my\r\nchestnut-tree shone white as a sheet of milk, bordered by countless\r\ngaudy tulips and opening flowers.\r\n\r\nThe sun was yet below the horizon, but every dew-drenched herb, and\r\nleaf, and tree, were distinctly visible in the clear pale light that\r\noverspread the sky.\r\n\r\nEvery pulse quickened, and all my energies became wound up to the\r\nutmost pitch by excitement, when I saw the mighty lord of the\r\nwilderness--a vast dun-coloured lion, with his large round head and\r\nshaggy mane, powerful legs, his close round body and tufted tail,\r\nthat shook wrathfully aloft as he trotted past swiftly, bearing a\r\ndead sheep in his mouth.\r\n\r\nPassing almost under the tree, and round the margin of the lake, he\r\ndisappeared in the forest; but a sense of his terrible presence\r\nseemed to linger about me still.  My doubts and irresolution were\r\nincreased; the dangers of the wilderness in which I wandered, alone\r\nand unarmed, became more vividly impressed upon me, and for a time I\r\nalmost regretted that I had left the coast, and the protection of my\r\nsavage task-masters.  But then the wife of Amoo, and her hideous\r\ndesire for possessing my head!\r\n\r\n\"Hope is the bounty of God!\" thought I, and as the forest remained\r\nstill and quiet--at least, as no sound reached my ear, save the\r\nincreasing hum of the myriads of insects warming into life and sport\r\nin the light and heat of the rising sun--I resolved to descend from\r\nmy perch, and follow the track of any stream which might lead to the\r\ncoast, for by the sea--the open, free, wide sea--lay my only hope of\r\nescape from this dangerous and detested shore.\r\n\r\nRemembering the geographical form of Africa, as represented on the\r\nmap, I knew that if I could, by any means, proceed westward for about\r\ntwo hundred and fifty miles or so round the Bight of Benin, I should\r\nbe so near our settlement at Cape Coast Castle as to be in safety.\r\nBut how, in such a country, was this to be accomplished?\r\n\r\nI had already begun my descent from the tree, when the noise of\r\nsomething coming rapidly through the forest made me scramble into my\r\nperch again.  And lo! a savage, armed as usual with a long asseguy,\r\nbut mounted on a swift dromedary, came from amid the trees, and\r\npaused by the lonely lake to give his great misshapen nag a drink;\r\nand while he did so, in his brawny form and tasselled apeskin apron\r\nand sandals, his eyes with their circles of red and yellow paint, the\r\nslit under his mouth, his hideous aspect and barbaric trappings, I\r\nrecognised the brother of Amoo--the King of the Rio Serpientes!\r\n\r\nWere both upon my track, or had chance alone brought him here?  I\r\nknew that if retaken, I had met with more mercy from the lion than\r\nfrom either; and the image of the wife of Amoo, with her sharp knife\r\nand basket of herbs and gums, seemed to rise before me.\r\n\r\nThe savage looked around him, and suddenly turning his dromedary,\r\nrode straight towards my place of concealment.  I grasped my hoe,\r\nresolved if he had seen me, not to yield up my wretched existence\r\nwithout a desperate struggle; but all unconscious of my presence, his\r\nsable majesty dismounted, placed his asseguy against the chestnut\r\ntree, spread a grass-mat at its root, and seating himself, proceeded\r\nquietly to light a species of hubble-bubble, or pipe made from a reed\r\nand a nut-shell.  Stuffing therein some dried herbs, he applied flint\r\nand steel, and began leisurely and literally to enjoy his morning\r\nweed.\r\n\r\nAt his neck I could see poor Robert Hartly's gold locket glittering.\r\n\r\nThe vicinity of this ferocious and tremendous personage, with the\r\nchances of his horde being all within hail, like the band of Roderick\r\nDhu, so greatly alarmed me, that fully a quarter of an hour elapsed\r\nbefore I rallied sufficiently to conceive the idea of appropriating\r\nhis quiet and docile dromedary (which was cropping the herbage close\r\nby), and using it as a means of reaching Cape Coast Castle, the\r\nwestern goal of all my hopes.\r\n\r\nI knew that this animal was deemed a miracle of swiftness even in\r\nthat burning clime, where they will travel with ease fifty miles per\r\nday.\r\n\r\nThe savage King seemed to be asleep, or in a waking doze; but I knew\r\nthat by habits of danger, activity, and a life spent in the open air,\r\nthe senses of these people were so acute, that the slightest sound\r\nwould revive him; and that, if once discovered, he could crush me\r\nlike a shrimp in his powerful grasp.\r\n\r\n\"Can I not kill him?\" thought I, as furious thoughts began to fill my\r\nmind; \"my hoe is too light--ha! the stone!\"\r\n\r\nI snatched the stone, which with difficulty I had conveyed up the\r\ntree overnight, as a missile against wild animals, and poised it in\r\nmy hands.  It was nearly twelve pounds weight, and the woolly skull\r\nof the King was immediately below me; but it might be thick as that\r\nof an elephant, so the missile would prove more harmless than a ball\r\nof worsted.\r\n\r\nIf I missed, death to me was certain; if I slew or stunned him, I had\r\nan equal certainty of escape.  Then I thought of poor Captain Baylis,\r\nof his tortured wife, of Hartly, and of that horrible butchery by the\r\nsteep rocks of the river Gabon, and a glow of merciless fury filled\r\nmy soul!\r\n\r\nThe stone shot from my hand, and, bathed in blood, quivering and\r\nsenseless, the brutal King of the Snake River rolled among the long\r\ndry grass, with foam issuing from his mouth, and the aperture below\r\nit.\r\n\r\nSwift as lightning I descended the tree--all cramped and stiff by a\r\nnight passed amid its branches; caught his dromedary by the bridle,\r\nsprang upon its back, snatched up the asseguy as a weapon for\r\ndefence, and, without casting a glance to ascertain whether I had\r\nbeen guilty of actual regicide, or had merely given him a crack upon\r\nhis imperial crown, urged the animal I bestrode westward at furious\r\nspeed, through a grove of pale green orange trees, where the rich\r\ndewy fruit hung like balls of gleaming gold in the light of the\r\nmorning sun.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLVI.\r\n\r\nFLIGHT CONTINUED.\r\n\r\nSteering my course westward, so closely as I could judge, I rode\r\nrapidly through wild and pathless places; and when mounted on an\r\nanimal so sure and swift of foot, I felt more confident of escape\r\nfrom any savages in whose way I might fall.\r\n\r\nI was not without a dread of wild animals, for the furious lion and\r\nthe stealthy panther roam everywhere through the forests of Africa;\r\nand though nearly the whole day passed without meeting one of either\r\nspecies, hundreds of pernicious serpents, black, or brown, or green\r\nand scaly, with glaring eyes, hissed at me from amid the long rank\r\ngrass; while brightly pinioned birds flew about me, and horrid\r\nbaboons and monkeys, of all kinds and sizes, leaped and frisked on\r\nevery hand, springing from branch to branch of the trees, where they\r\nswung madly to and fro by their tails as I passed.\r\n\r\nAt a distance rose the smoke of fires, with the dome-shaped wigwams\r\nof three negro villages; but these I avoided by keeping far off, and\r\nwithout tarrying a moment for food or refreshment, pushed on\r\nwestward, through a broad plain where the maize, cassava, and pulse\r\nwere cultivated in little patches.  On, on where the banana, the\r\npapaw, the lemon, orange, and tamarind trees grew wild in thickets;\r\nwhere the spotted giraffe, the striped zebra, and the graceful little\r\nantelope, made their lair, and trembled when they heard the roar of\r\nthe lion of Libya.\r\n\r\nOn, on I rode to reach the castle of Cape Coast, and urged the\r\ndromedary to his utmost speed.\r\n\r\nLeaving the plain, at the end of which the sun was setting now, I\r\ncontinued my way still westward across a long tract of desert sand;\r\nand now for the first time I paused to look around me.\r\n\r\nOn the borders of this desert grew some wild lotus trees.\r\nDismounting, I took some of their farinaceous berries with joy to\r\nassuage my hunger, and found their flavour to resemble sweet\r\nginger-bread.\r\n\r\nAfter a draught of water from a runnel--water that was actually\r\ntepid--I remounted with difficulty, as my strength was nearly gone\r\nnow; having ridden the livelong day under a burning sun, which left\r\nthe sand so hot that it scorched my feet, while the finely pulverized\r\ngrains of it were floating in a cloud about me, and filling my mouth\r\nand eyes as it whirled in eddies when the faint evening wind passed\r\nover the arid waste, rippling up its surface as if it was water.\r\n\r\nAt a distance appeared some bustards and long-legged cranes; but no\r\nother living thing, as the setting sun, vast, round, and blood-red,\r\nafter shedding a steady crimson glare across the desert waste, sank\r\nbeneath the horizon.\r\n\r\nAt the quarter of his declension, I perceived a grove of trees, and\r\nfearing to remain all night on the open waste, rode swiftly towards\r\nthem; but they were farther off than I imagined, and seemed to recede\r\nas I progressed, so deceptive is the distance of a level sandy\r\ndesert; thus night was far advanced when I reached the shelter of\r\ntheir foliage, and overcome by a lassitude--a total\r\nprostration--there was no resisting, I had just strength sufficient\r\nto throw the bridle of the dromedary over the branch of a tree, and\r\nto roll off his back upon a bank of soft turf, when a heavy sleep\r\nfell on me.\r\n\r\nWaking next morning, stiff, cramped, and drenched with dew, I looked\r\nround for my four-footed friend, but he had disappeared, and not a\r\ntrace of him remained.\r\n\r\nThus, after all the toil and travelling of the past day, my prospects\r\nwere little better than before.\r\n\r\nBut the forest scene was lovely!  It was full of scarlet and golden\r\nblossoms, all bright as the glossy plumage of the parrots that\r\nnestled amid the foliage; while the perfume of the orange and lemon\r\ntrees, which the dew of the past night had refreshed, filled the\r\nmorning air with delicious fragrance; and now the mighty hum of a\r\nmyriad great insects loaded it with monotonous and perpetual sound.\r\n\r\nOn the outskirts of the wood, between me and the far-stretching vista\r\nof the white sandy desert, my eye suddenly detected the tall dark\r\nfigure of a savage, stalking about with a long asseguy in his right\r\nhand.  He was naked, all save a scanty scarlet grass-cloth around his\r\nbody.\r\n\r\nCoiled up in my lurking-place, I watched with considerable interest\r\nthe motions of this man of the wilderness.  Supple, brawny, and\r\nstrong, he had the form of a bronze Hercules, the agility of an\r\nantelope, and the eye of an eagle.  He had detected the footmarks of\r\nthe dromedary, and gliding about, with a light stealthy step, and a\r\nkeen prowling eye, he tracked them with his face near the ground,\r\nuntil he came close to where I lay, but never, the while, did he\r\nventure _within_ the actual boundary of the wood.\r\n\r\nSuddenly his eye fell upon me!\r\n\r\nHe started; uttered a shrill cry, and poised his long asseguy, as if\r\nabout to launch it; then he lowered it, and uttered a whoop, which\r\nbrought some twenty or thirty other savages around him.\r\n\r\nThey all pointed to me in a manner and with expressions that seemed\r\nto indicate surprise or rage; they gesticulated violently, and by\r\nwhat they said, I could learn that by being _within_ the forest, I\r\nwas guilty of an act of sacrilege.  Their language seemed a dialect\r\nof that spoken by the tribe I had lied from, on the north bank of the\r\nGabon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLVII.\r\n\r\nTHE WOOD OF THE DEVIL.\r\n\r\nMaking signs that I was a friend, or wished to be considered one, by\r\ncasting away my asseguy, and placing my hands upon my head and\r\nbreast, I advanced with a resolute aspect, but with a quaking heart,\r\ntowards them.\r\n\r\nBy what I heard then, and learned afterwards, I had violated the\r\nsanctity of a holy place--the abode of a fetish--as this wood had for\r\nages been dedicated to the Devil, whom these savages, like those of\r\nBenin, worship as a dreadful spirit, not to love, but to conciliate.\r\n\r\nNo one entered this wood, which was composed of giant chestnuts,\r\npalm, orange, and lime trees, all growing wild for many leagues, as\r\nthe spirit of evil was alleged to harbour in its inmost recesses.\r\n\r\nHere then, on its skirts, a mother and her infant were sometimes\r\nsacrificed with tortures too terrible for description, to propitiate\r\nthis dark spirit; though in some rare instances a husband might\r\nransom his doomed wife with a poor female slave, captured from a\r\nhostile tribe.\r\n\r\nSo sacred is this wood deemed, that if a person accidentally enters\r\nit by one path, he must force his way through it to the very end\r\nwithout turning or looking back--a feat none ever performed, as it\r\nteems with wild beasts, whose fangs and claws speedily dispose of the\r\nintruder.  Even a foreign _negro_, or his wives, dare not enter it;\r\nthen, what punishment was due to me, a white man, for having ventured\r\nto do so?\r\n\r\nDapper, a very old traveller, and a bold fellow, too, mentions that,\r\nto ridicule the faith of the people in this forest, he went shooting\r\ninto it, and deliberately turned _back_ when about half way through.\r\n\r\n\"What will the Devil think of this?\" he asked the negro priests, who\r\nwere scared by his audacity, and confounded by his return in safety.\r\n\r\n\"He does not trouble himself about white men,\" was their response;\r\nand, singular to say, our traveller was permitted to go unscathed,\r\nfor savages generally admire courage and temerity.\r\n\r\nHowever, the negroes into whose hands I had unfortunately fallen\r\nseemed of a different opinion from Mr. Dapper's friends; and after a\r\nnoisy palaver, to which I listened with an agonizing interest, my\r\nlife being in the balance, they laid violent hands upon me.\r\n\r\nI was dragged to a tall palm-tree, which grew on the verge of the\r\nforest, with some of its fibrous roots extending among the grassy\r\nborder on one side, and into the dry sand of the desert on the other.\r\n\r\nI was placed with my back against the stem; and there they bound me\r\nhard and fast by drawing my arms round it and tying my wrists\r\nsecurely by the tendrils of a convolvolus--one of the climbing kind,\r\nwhich, when tough and green, is strong as a new inch-rope.\r\n\r\nThey then retired, mocking and grinning, and ever and anon\r\nthreatening to launch their asseguys at me; thus I fully expected to\r\nbe martyred like St. Sebastian, as we see him in Guido's picture at\r\nDulwich; but they left me, and disappeared round an angle of the\r\nforest, abandoning me to my fate and my own terrible reflections.\r\n\r\nIt was midday now, and above me shone the blaze of an almost vertical\r\nsun; thus I found the shade of the drooping palm branches grateful\r\nand pleasant--a boon, a blessing.\r\n\r\nLest the savages might be watching me from a distance, I did not\r\nattempt to release my hands; but after nearly an hour elapsed,\r\nfearing that strength might fail me from the cramped manner in which\r\nmy arms were bound backward round the tree, I strove to rend the\r\ngreen withes which fettered me to it.\r\n\r\nVain task!\r\n\r\nStrain them as I might, the tough and unyielding tendrils of the\r\nconvolvoli only seemed to tighten, and to cut me as I tore, wrenched,\r\nand struggled, without success.\r\n\r\nThe horror of being left thus defenceless at the mercy of the wild\r\nanimals with which the forest teemed was so great, that I forgot\r\nalike the pangs of hunger and those of thirst, which are greater\r\nstill; and again and again strove frantically for freedom, until,\r\nwith the futility of each successive effort, the conviction forced\r\nitself upon me, that without human assistance I could never be\r\nreleased, but might perish of starvation, or be devoured alive.\r\n\r\nHuman assistance! who, then, would be disposed to aid me?  And, if\r\nso, who would come in time?\r\n\r\nAnd so the hot day passed breathlessly, slowly, and terribly on!\r\n\r\nAs the burning sun revolved towards the West, the lengthening shadows\r\nof the wood went round in the reverse direction, until the level\r\nsunbeams cast them far across the arid desert I had traversed so\r\nswiftly yesterday; and as the light of evening sank, the hues of that\r\nwhite glistening waste changed to yellow, then to brown, and then to\r\namber.\r\n\r\nMy arms ached till they seemed in process of being rent from my\r\nshoulders: so, panting, hot, breathless, and half dead with thirst, I\r\nreclined against that abhorred tree, from which I could in no way\r\nfree myself.\r\n\r\nAs evening deepened, the hum of insect life lessened, and the\r\nbright-plumed birds of the wilderness were seeking their nests in the\r\nfoliage above me; but on me their beauty was lost.  Even the cock of\r\nthe Libyan forest, with his purple breast, his crimson and green\r\npinions, was unheeded, as he picked up a few grains of millet at my\r\nfeet, and passed to his mate in the orange tree.\r\n\r\nA raven or two, soaring through the blue immensity of the sky,\r\nsuggested dreadful thoughts of what I _might be_ on the morrow.\r\n\r\nThen little snakes came from amid the long grass to writhe and\r\nwriggle on the sand, which was yet warm with the sunshine of the past\r\nday; and they made me think of the dreadful cobra-capello, with his\r\nflamelike tongue, charged with poison and death--the hooded serpent,\r\nwhich, when in fury, has been known to rear its horrid front, and\r\nspring at a man on horseback; and then of the berg-adder, which I\r\nfeared still more, because it is so difficult to discover, and which\r\nI had no means of avoiding if it approached me.\r\n\r\nMy past reading had given me, moreover, a somewhat exaggerated idea\r\nof the number of wild animals in Africa.  At Ascension, I had seen a\r\nnarrative of a _Voyage à l'Isle de France_, by a person who styled\r\nhimself an _Officier du Roi_, and who stated that, in the forests of\r\nAfrica, \"there were to be found whole _armies_ of lions.\"\r\n\r\nLater travellers have ridiculed this idea, but be that as it may, the\r\ndistant roaring of a lion now added to the accumulating dangers which\r\nsurrounded me, and filled my soul with emotions of horror so great\r\nthat I could not summon even a thought of prayer, and memory refused\r\nto supply me with the most hackneyed ejaculation of piety.\r\n\r\nBound and helpless, without means of defence or flight, I now heard\r\nthis terrible animal approaching me, crushing the shrubs and branches\r\nin his native forest as he came.\r\n\r\nOn hearing this sound, so fraught with danger, a zebra and several\r\nantelopes bounded out of the wood and paused to listen.  Again that\r\nprolonged cry rang upon the still air.  The zebra cowered and\r\nshuddered, and after crouching for a moment, sprang away into the\r\ndesert of sand, followed by the fleet little antelopes (which were of\r\nthe kind called Guinea Deer, having legs no thicker than a\r\ntobacco-pipe), and they were all soon out of sight.\r\n\r\nThe roar was singular in sound.  Hoarse and inarticulate, it swelled\r\nupon the air like a prolonged O, that seemed to come from and pass to\r\na vast distance.  It never became loud or shrill, but the _idea_ it\r\nsuggested of the animal itself, made it seem to pierce the very soul;\r\nand all the tales I had read or heard of the lion, and all the\r\nterrors I had conjured up as being embodied in his tremendous person,\r\ncame upon me like a flood.\r\n\r\nThere are some who aver that if he has once tasted human flesh he\r\nwill for ever disdain any other.\r\n\r\nWith great bewilderment of mind--like one in a dream that is full of\r\nnightmare--I beheld a great and dark-skinned lion, with an enormous\r\ndusky mane, run out of the wood about a hundred yards off, and, after\r\nlooking about, he came straight towards me, for by some strange\r\ninstinct he became sensible of my vicinity in a moment.  In his mouth\r\nhe bore a zebra (about the size of a Shetland pony), which he grasped\r\nby its crushed back, and the legs of which were trailing on the\r\nground as he bore it along, with all the air and all the ease of a\r\ncat carrying off a large rat.\r\n\r\nOn beholding me he dropped his prey, which was quite dead, and after\r\nuttering another hoarse roar, continued to approach, with his nose\r\nclose to the ground, while switching his tufted tail and shaking his\r\nshaggy mane, preparatory, as I imagined, to making a spring upon me;\r\nthen I closed my eyes, and with a heart that died within me, resigned\r\nmyself to my fate.\r\n\r\nOnward he came, step by step, for I could hear his footfalls on the\r\nground!\r\n\r\nOnward yet, and now every pulse seemed to stand still!\r\n\r\nThen a warm and fetid breath played upon my face, I felt his whiskers\r\ntouch my breast, and there was a strange snuffing sound in my\r\ntingling ears.\r\n\r\nOpening my eyes, I beheld close to mine the tremendous visage of the\r\nlion, the enormous upper lip, in form so suggestive of cruelty and\r\nrapacity, and all studded with wiry hairs, bristling out fiercely on\r\neither side; the low flat forehead and impending brows; the wild orbs\r\nthat seemed to glare from amid the masses of his tangled mane; the\r\nopen jaws and sharp teeth, reeking and steaming with the warm blood\r\nof the zebra he had just slain!\r\n\r\nAfter deliberately snuffing at me in this manner for a second or\r\nso--a time which seemed an eternity, so much agony of thought and\r\ntension of the heart were compressed within it, he quietly _turned\r\nabout_, took his dead zebra, as if he deemed it the most preferable\r\nsupper of the two, trotted into the wood and disappeared.\r\n\r\nThe agonies of a lifetime seemed concentrated into that minute!\r\n\r\nAll I had endured now proved too much for me.  A sudden insensibility\r\nsank like a cloud over all my senses, and a sleep--the sleep of utter\r\nprostration of mind and body, fell upon me.  Thus, the noon of the\r\nnext day was far advanced before I became again conscious, or aware\r\nof my miserable existence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLVIII.\r\n\r\nRETAKEN.\r\n\r\nReleased from the tree, but still benumbed and sore after being so\r\nlong bound to it, I was now stretched upon the grass, under the\r\nshadow of its great fan-like branches.  Many persons were moving\r\nabout me, and the hum of their voices filled my ear.\r\n\r\nRaising myself slowly and heavily upon my hands, I saw around me\r\nhundreds of negroes, and close to mine was the ugly visage of--Amoo.\r\n\r\n\"Oh,\" thought I, bitterly; \"this is too much!  A prisoner again, and\r\nafter all the dangers I have dared--the friends I have seen\r\nperish--the miseries I have undergone!  Will fate never weary of\r\npersecuting me?\"\r\n\r\nBut Amoo was not such a wicked fellow after all.\r\n\r\nProducing his gourd bottle of palm wine, he mixed it with cool water\r\nfrom a shaded spring, and forced me to imbibe a long draught, after\r\nwhich I sat up and looked about me more collectedly.\r\n\r\nI was in the midst of a species of negro bivouac, consisting of many\r\nhundreds of men and women, with camels and dromedaries laden with\r\nvarious stuffs and rudely fashioned weapons and utensils, made up in\r\nbales with grass matting and cordage.\r\n\r\nThey were cooking at several fires, and in various modes, the flesh\r\nof an elephant which they had snared, as Amoo informed me, in a pit\r\non the other side of the forest on the preceding day, and the meat of\r\nwhich is esteemed in these latitudes as a veritable dainty--a right\r\nroyal luxury.  He pressed me to eat a slice or so, but in my weak\r\nstate, and the fever of my spirit, the odour and the aspect of it\r\nwere more than enough for me, so a mouthful or two of boiled yam and\r\npalm wine sufficed.\r\n\r\nThe negroes were all well armed with asseguys, swords, bows, muskets,\r\nand targets, as if proceeding on a hostile expedition.  Among them\r\nwere many who were better clad and more civilized in aspect than the\r\npainted savages who dwell by the Snake River, and these, Amoo\r\ninformed me, were subjects of the King of Benin.\r\n\r\nAfter relating how his companions had found me bound to the tree,\r\nsenseless or asleep, he inquired how it came to pass I was there.\r\n\r\n\"I fled to escape your wife,\" said I, looking round fearfully.\r\n\r\n\"Yah, yah,\" said he, laughing; \"I was sorry for the loss of my white\r\nslave, but am glad you escaped her knife; for she wished much to\r\nornament her big canoe, so she got the head of another white man.\"\r\n\r\n\"Another--who--which?\"\r\n\r\n\"Amoo does not know; he tried to steal a canoe and escape to the\r\nPongo Islands, but was retaken, and so my wife got his head for her\r\ncanoe.  She boiled it in a stone pipkin, with gums and herbs, stuck\r\nfish-bones in its nose and ears, and now it will last for many, many\r\nsuns and moons, without decay.\"\r\n\r\n(Who was this _other_ unfortunate that had perished so miserably?  He\r\nmight be my friend Hartly--if indeed it was not he who was so cruelly\r\ndestroyed in the basket of thorns.)\r\n\r\n\"Never mind who it was,\" said Amoo, divining my thoughts, \"since you\r\nare found again.\"\r\n\r\n\"To be your prisoner?\" I sighed.\r\n\r\nAmoo grinned, leered cunningly, and shook his woolly head.\r\n\r\n\"What then?\"\r\n\r\n\"To be reserved for something better than being my slave.\"\r\n\r\n\"_Better!_\" I reiterated, with perplexity; \"how--where?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yah, yah--you will learn in good time.\"\r\n\r\n\"When?\" I exclaimed, with impatience.\r\n\r\n\"On our reaching the capital of Benin.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are going there with all these people?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yah.\"\r\n\r\n\"For what purpose--to fight?\"\r\n\r\n\"No.\"\r\n\r\n\"What then?\"\r\n\r\n\"To bury Zabadie, the king, who is dead.\"\r\n\r\nI was somewhat comforted by this, as everything added to the chances\r\nof escape; for I knew that European vessels frequently anchored in\r\nthe Bight of Benin, and I associated ideas of greater civilization\r\nwith that quarter of Africa, though it bordered on Dahomey--that\r\nbarbarous land of blood and terror.\r\n\r\nIt was evident that Amoo knew nothing about my encounter in the wood\r\nwith the King, his brother, or the manner in which I had borrowed the\r\nroyal dromedary; for he informed me, in the course of our obscure and\r\nsomewhat pantomimic conversation, that on his return he would\r\nprobably find himself King of the Snake River, as his brother was not\r\nexpected to live.\r\n\r\nI inquired why.\r\n\r\n\"As he was asleep under a tree, a great baboon let a big stone fall\r\nupon his head, and nearly killed him,\" replied Amoo, with perfect\r\nunconcern, and I cannot plead guilty to feeling the smallest\r\ncompunction in the matter.\r\n\r\nThis species of caravan was proceeding from the territory of Gabon,\r\nwhose king is a vassal of the monarch of Benin, with a tribute of\r\nfemale slaves, baskets, gourd vessels, panther skins, elephants'\r\nteeth, and gold dust, to assist at the funeral of the late royal\r\ndefunct, or to lay at the feet of his successor; and I was pleased to\r\nfind that we were to proceed as nearly as possible along the coast.\r\n\r\nI resolved to take the first opportunity of securing arms--a musket\r\nand knife if possible--of leaving the cavalcade, and concealing\r\nmyself in a wood near the sea-shore, there to await a ship; but the\r\nhope was formed in vain, for Amoo, who frequently spoke of the \"great\r\nfuture in store for me at Benin,\" never lost sight of me for an\r\ninstant, either by night or by day, when we halted.\r\n\r\nWhen we did so, we warily lighted a circle of large fires to scare\r\nwild animals from our bivouac.  and thus could sleep in security.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLIX.\r\n\r\nTHE CARAVAN.\r\n\r\nThe whole of the coast there is broken by innumerable river\r\nestuaries, the banks of which are covered by bright green reeds, and\r\nbroad-leaved weeds and canes of mighty growth.  Thus our progress was\r\nslow, as we had frequently to embark in canoes on those frowsy\r\nwaters, whose miasma is so pestilential by night, and which are ever\r\nrendered dangerous by the alligators and hippopotami that lurk in the\r\noozy holes along their banks.\r\n\r\nAt a place where we were about to cross, the black scouts, who formed\r\na species of advanced guard, returned in haste and excitement to\r\nstate that one of the last-named animals (one of great size, too) was\r\nasleep on the bank.\r\n\r\nOn hearing this the caravan halted, and Amoo, being a brave and hardy\r\nwarrior, and moreover the brother of a king, claimed the privilege of\r\nassailing it.  Armed with a spear made specially for the purpose, he\r\nadvanced to the enterprise, accompanied only by one companion and by\r\nme, to whom he relinquished for a time his gaily painted bow and\r\nquiver of poisoned arrows.\r\n\r\nI had heard so much of those fierce and unwieldy monsters, that I\r\nfollowed him with considerable interest and curiosity as we\r\nshouldered and pushed a passage through a dense and leafy jungle of\r\ngigantic weeds, prickly yams, serrated grass, and reeds of enormous\r\nheight, which flourished amid the deep quagmire that bordered the\r\nbroad bosom of this majestic but nameless river, whose waters are now\r\nrolling, as they have rolled for ages, into the Gulf of Guinea.\r\n\r\nOn forcing our way through a wall of reeds, we suddenly came upon the\r\nhippopotamus, which was lying on his left side, asleep in the\r\nsunshine, and stretched at full length upon a piece of greensward,\r\nwhere, probably, he had been grazing overnight.\r\n\r\nThe aspect of this mis-shapen monster, which was about fourteen feet\r\nlong--his singular form, a great round body with short elephantine\r\nlegs, a broad, square head and stunted tail--was as repulsive as the\r\nsize of his great cavernous mouth with its terrible incisors was\r\nappalling.\r\n\r\nHe slept soundly, however, so Amoo, gliding stealthily as a serpent,\r\napproached until within seven feet of where he lay, snoring heavily,\r\nand basking in the hot and breathless sunshine.\r\n\r\nWith a dexterity which my poor old friend Hans Peterkin would have\r\nappreciated highly, Amoo, with a line, attached to his spear a light\r\nwooden float which serves to show where the animal lurks when he\r\ntakes the water after being struck; then, while the attending warrior\r\nstood near to hand a second lance, Amoo raised his sinewy form on\r\ntiptoe, poised his barbed weapon, and hurled it, whizzing, with\r\nsingular force and dexterity, full at the sleeping animal.\r\n\r\nDeep through the thick, dark hide sunk the pointed spear, until its\r\niron head was completely buried.  At the moment it left his hand,\r\nAmoo, an agile and practised huntsman, sprang backward several paces;\r\nbut not so his unfortunate companion, on whom the awakened monster\r\nleaped with the weight of an elephant united to the fury of a\r\npanther, and in an instant crushed him to death in his enormous jaws,\r\ndoubling up the body and grinding ribs and legs together till they\r\nwere churned into a mass of blood.\r\n\r\nThen plunging into the river, he disappeared, leaving the water\r\ncovered with froth and bloody ripples, that ran in circles to either\r\nshore; but still the little buoy attached to the spear or harpoon\r\nfloated and bobbed up and down to indicate where he lay writhing\r\namong the weeds and beds of bright blue coral far down below--for the\r\ncoral is blue there.\r\n\r\nAmoo's shrill cries brought several negroes to his assistance; and\r\nthese, enraged by the sudden death of their friend, began to haul\r\nsturdily on the line, which was a good English rope, obtained from\r\nsome passing ship by theft or barter; this irritated the wounded\r\nanimal, so he came surging, bleeding, and frothing to the surface\r\nagain, when a dozen spears, whizzing through the air, were launched\r\nby unerring hands, and he was soon slain, and amid exulting yells,\r\nwhooping, and beating of tum-tums, was hauled close in shore among\r\nthe reeds, and there, as he was too bulky to be pulled entirely out\r\nof the water, was cut up in large pieces and placed in baskets on the\r\nbacks of the camels, dromedaries, and slaves.\r\n\r\nAmoo declared this prey was too full-grown, and consequently too fat\r\nfor eating; but added, that his \"skin would make excellent whips.\"\r\n\r\nThis was the _fifth_ he had slain--thus he equalled Commodus who slew\r\nfive in the amphitheatre.\r\n\r\nThe country through which we travelled was low, flat, and thickly\r\nwooded; thus we seldom saw the sea; yet, when glimpses of its bright\r\nblue waters, stretching to the horizon far away, came before us at\r\ntimes through the groves of orange, lime, and palm trees, or through\r\nvalleys where the white tufts of the cotton buds flecked the\r\ngreenness of the luxuriant scenery, how anxiously, how affectionately\r\nI gazed upon it, for it was the high road to my home--the way to\r\nfreedom and dear old England!\r\n\r\nAfter travelling many days, until I was almost sinking with fatigue,\r\nby the intense heat of the atmosphere and the number of things I was\r\ncompelled (as a slave) to carry, we came at last in sight of the\r\ngreat city of Benin, which stretches far along the right bank of the\r\nriver Formosa.\r\n\r\nI hailed it with emotions of undisguised joy, for Amoo had been daily\r\nrecurring to the liberty and honours that were in store for me there.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER L.\r\n\r\nWE REACH THE CAPITAL.\r\n\r\nI resolved while life remained to persevere to the last in attempting\r\nan escape.\r\n\r\n\"'I shall never succeed,' is often the parent of failure\" (to quote\r\nIsaac Taylor when writing on character).  \"'I will not try any more,'\r\nensures disappointment.  'It is all _chance_, and I am not in luck,'\r\nmost commonly leads to disgrace.\"\r\n\r\nCalling his words to memory, I resolved to trust to none of these\r\nfatal phrases, for I had passed through too many perils not to hope\r\nthat a few more might be surmounted.\r\n\r\nAn old writer says, \"The King of Benin has men in pay to furnish\r\ntravellers with water, and these keep great pots full of that which\r\nis fresh and clear at convenient distances, with a shell to drink it\r\nout of; but no person must take a drop without paying for it; and if\r\nthe waterman is absent, they drink, leave the money, and pursue their\r\nway.\"\r\n\r\nIt may have been so when old Dapper wrote or romanced, but not a drop\r\nof water found we on the weary track to quench our burning thirst,\r\nsave in stagnant tarns by the wayside.\r\n\r\nIt was towards the close of a day when we had been nearly choked by\r\nthe sulphurous heat which filled the air after a violent\r\nthunderstorm, that we approached the city of Benin, and saw its long\r\nlines of huts, or wigwams, each one story high, covering for many\r\nmiles the right bank of the Formosa, one of the greatest estuaries\r\nwhich disgorge their waters into the Bight of Benin.\r\n\r\nGroves of beautiful wood, orange, lime trees, cotton and pepper\r\nbushes, spread along the banks of the river, and many floating\r\nislets, covered with flowers and unknown fruit trees, are constantly\r\nborne past by its waters, from the unexplored lands through which\r\nthey flow.\r\n\r\nThe city and its walls too were unlike aught I had ever seen before;\r\nyet their extent was great, and the dusky hordes that peopled them\r\nare probably unnumbered and unknown.\r\n\r\nWe were admitted through a wooden gate in the ramparts, which were\r\ncomposed of the trunks of trees pegged together, as palisades are in\r\nAmerica, but loopholed for arrows or musketry; and the guard at this\r\ngate, as at all the others, was composed entirely of women armed with\r\nbows, lances, and old firelocks, for, like his royal brother of\r\nDahomey, the sovereign of Benin has somewhere about four thousand\r\nwives, whom he has armed and formed into troops, and who--when off\r\nduty--make crocks, pots, and pipkins of clay, from the sale of which\r\nhe derives his principal revenue.\r\n\r\nThey were all stout and handsome negresses, attired in a species of\r\npetticoat which reached below the knee, with a vest to cover the\r\nbreast; their hair was dyed into alternate red and white locks, and\r\nthey had great rings of polished metal on their otherwise bare arms.\r\n\r\nThrough this guarded gate our long cavalcade of laden camels,\r\ndromedaries, negroes, and slaves, passed down a populous street of\r\ngreat width, and nearly three miles in length.  The houses, or huts,\r\non either side, were alike singular in aspect and construction, being\r\nbuilt of red clay, and having behind or around them spacious gardens\r\nand shady groves of lime and orange trees.  Vast crowds of male and\r\nfemale blacks followed us, but in solemn silence, as the cavalcade\r\nbore a double tribute to the dead king and his successor, towards\r\nwhose royal palace--if the odd collection of fantastic buildings\r\ncould so be called--we now proceeded.\r\n\r\nWe passed through a kind of square, which Amoo described to me as the\r\nmarket-place; and there the king's female guards were exposing for\r\nsale great quantities of their clay pots and pipkins, gourd bottles,\r\ncalibash basons, wooden spoons and ladles of all sorts and sizes, at\r\ntheir own prices; for these industrious Amazons enjoyed the entire\r\nmonopoly of this branch of trade; and as a hint that none might\r\ninterfere with them, there hung by iron hooks upon a gibbet the\r\nheadless bodies of four men, in a frightful state of decay, with\r\nturkey buzzards feeding on the fragments that dropped from them, as\r\nthey sweltered in the burning sunshine.\r\n\r\nIn the centre of this market-place rose a pyramid some twenty feet\r\nhigh, formed entirely of human skulls, bleached white as snow by the\r\nalternate rain and sun--a ghastly and terrible trophy of barbarism\r\nand cruelty, which reminded me of stories I had read of old Mexico,\r\nwhere similar monuments adorned the cities of the Incas; or of the\r\ntower formed of the skulls of slaughtered Christians, now standing in\r\nthe Mohammedan isle of Gerba.\r\n\r\nFascinated by this revolting spectacle, I passed on with the dusky\r\nmultitude; and Amoo informed me (while all prostrated their ugly\r\nfaces in the dust) that we stood at the gate of the king's palace!\r\n\r\nIt was a vast collection of rambling wooden houses, which formed the\r\ndwellings of the sovereign, his wives, fiadoors, or officials,\r\nstables for his horses and dromedaries, dens for slaves or prisoners\r\n(a commodity with which he seldom troubled himself), magazines for\r\nstores and plunder.  These edifices extended for nearly a mile before\r\nus; and on all those quaint buildings, which were barbarously adorned\r\nwith the bones and horns of animals, a grinning human skull was the\r\nchief ornament.\r\n\r\nThrough a barrier _manned_ by a motley multitude of female guards,\r\nmany of whom were armed with bayonets and old brass-butted Tower\r\nmuskets, which may have done service under Moore and Wellington, we\r\nwere conducted into a court surrounded by copper figures, so\r\nmonstrous in aspect and conception, that the eye laboured in vain to\r\ndiscover whether they were meant to represent men, beasts, or birds.\r\n\r\nThe crowd who followed were all well armed with spears, bows and\r\narrows, which, as Amoo informed me, were duly poisoned by the\r\n_fetishers_, or priests.  Many of the fiadoors wore gay dresses of\r\nDutch scarlet cloth, caps edged with civet fur, and necklaces of\r\njasper and fine coral, or rings of yellow copper, bracelets of lions'\r\nteeth, and bucklers of rhinoceros hide.\r\n\r\nRound this court were wooden pillars, curiously carved and painted,\r\nand, in some instances, covered with plates of engraved copper--the\r\nhieroglyphical records of battles, victories, and massacres--the\r\nedifices were roofed with palm canes, and had many fantastic\r\npinnacles, surmounted by human skulls, or birds dried and prepared,\r\nwith their pinions outspread.\r\n\r\nIn the centre of the court, about twenty negroes, captured from some\r\nhostile tribe, were digging a deep hole, like a vast grave, with\r\nwooden shovels; and they grinned at us malevolently as we passed them.\r\n\r\nAmoo now told me \"that the time was come to which he had so often\r\nreferred, when a great honour would be conferred on me, and when we\r\nmust part.\"\r\n\r\nI knew not what all this meant, but bewildered by the scenes through\r\nwhich I had passed, the strange places in which I found myself,\r\nwearied by the toil of our journey, choked by dust and heat almost to\r\nfainting, I resigned myself to the custody of the negress guard, and\r\nleft Amoo, whom hitherto I had considered a species of protector.\r\nPerceiving the dejected state I was in, he gave me a draught from his\r\ngourd bottle; and as I was thrust into my prison, and the door of it\r\nclosed upon me, I saw for the last time save once, the dark visage of\r\nthis friendly savage, who never forgot that I had rescued his child\r\nfrom the baboon.\r\n\r\nThe wooden door was secured upon me; the hum of guttural voices died\r\naway as the cavalcade passed on to some other portion of this vast\r\nand rambling habitation of barbarous royalty; then I was left to my\r\nown reflections, and partly in the dark; at least, there was just\r\nsufficient light to enable me to see a pile of straw, or dried river\r\ngrass, on which I threw myself in weariness, if not in despair, as I\r\nknew not what new misfortune fate had in store for me.\r\n\r\nSleep, oblivion, I courted in vain.  I was now, though exhausted, in\r\ntoo high a state of nervous excitement for sleep; and as my eyes\r\nbecame accustomed to the dim twilight of my prison, I could perceive\r\nthe chamber to be fashioned of the trunks of trees, squared,\r\nsmoothed, and pegged together, and then painted with barbarous\r\nfigures.  Above the door by which I had entered were three human\r\nskulls, placed upon the hoofs of hippopotami, as brackets.\r\n\r\nA sound as of something rustling in a distant corner attracted my\r\nattention.  I approached, and saw upon a pile of straw and dry leaves\r\na white man extended at full length, and almost destitute of clothing.\r\n\r\nI drew nearer softly, for I knew not whether this new companion in\r\nmisfortune might be alive or dead.\r\n\r\nThen imagine what were my emotions on discovering him to be my\r\nfriend, sunk in a profound slumber--my old friend, Robert Hartly,\r\ncaptain of the fated _Leda_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LI.\r\n\r\nAN OLD FRIEND IN A NEW PLACE.\r\n\r\nThe pallor of his countenance, his wasted form, and sunken features\r\nshocked me, for I was quite unaware or heedless that he would find an\r\nequal ravage in my own appearance.  His beard and hair grew in matted\r\nmasses about his sunburnt face, and his once stout and manly hands\r\nwere thin and wan as those of a consumptive girl.\r\n\r\nI shook his shoulder; he awoke, and turned listlessly to me at first;\r\nthen with a strange cry of mingled joy and grief, he exclaimed--\r\n\r\n\"Jack!\"\r\n\r\n\"Bob--Bob Hartly!\"\r\n\r\nSuch was all we could utter for some seconds as each clasped and\r\nshook the hands of the other.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Jack Manly,\" he exclaimed, in a broken voice, \"I would rather\r\nsee you in your grave than in this place with me!\"\r\n\r\n\"How--why--what do you mean?\"\r\n\r\n\"My poor lad, you know not for what we are reserved.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not--not to be killed and eaten?\" said I, in a low voice of dismay.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, worse than that.  Do you not know?\"\r\n\r\n\"No.\"\r\n\r\n\"My poor friend--my poor friend!\"\r\n\r\n\"What on earth can be worse than that?  Amoo told me----\"\r\n\r\n\"Who is Amoo?\"\r\n\r\n\"A chief, the brother of the King of the Rio Serpientes.\"\r\n\r\n\"The savage brother of a savage!  And he told you----\"\r\n\r\n\"That I was reserved for the greatest honour?\"\r\n\r\n\"Honours indeed!\" reiterated Hartly, with a bitter laugh.\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did he add, you should have _liberty_ to enjoy your honours?\"\r\n\r\n\"No.\"\r\n\r\n\"Air--breath--sunshine--light--life?\"\r\n\r\n\"No!\"\r\n\r\n\"I thought not, for these accursed savages are as subtle and severe\r\nas they are cruel and sanguinary.\"\r\n\r\n\"What _do_ you mean, Hartly?\"\r\n\r\n\"That we are reserved for _burial alive_.\"\r\n\r\n\"Alive!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes--with their king who is just dead.  It is the custom here to\r\ncelebrate the obsequies of royal personages--of kings especially--in\r\na frantic and barbarous manner.  Oh, Jack! after all we have seen and\r\nsuffered together, is it not cruel of fate to persecute and finish us\r\nthus?  And is it not strange that in this age of a civilized world\r\nsuch things _can_ be?\"\r\n\r\n\"I will fight to the last!\" I exclaimed, furiously.\r\n\r\n\"We have not a single weapon.\"\r\n\r\n\"But these female guards have plenty.\"\r\n\r\n\"The weakest among them is stronger than both of us put together\r\n_now_,\" said he, despondingly.\r\n\r\n\"We must not perish thus, Hartly--we _shall_ escape!\" said I,\r\nemphatically.\r\n\r\n\"But how?\"\r\n\r\n\"Time will show--we were nearly as desperately circumstanced when\r\nfoul of the iceberg, or beset in the field ice.\"\r\n\r\n\"We have still a few days for deliberation; but meantime, tell me how\r\nyou came here.\"\r\n\r\n\"I was brought to Benin by Amoo, who saved me from dying of hunger,\r\nor by the teeth and claws of wild animals in the Devil's wood, where\r\nsome savages found me concealed, and bound me hand and foot by withes\r\nto a tree.\"\r\n\r\n\"Tell me all about this, Jack.\"\r\n\r\nI related briefly all that had occurred to me since we had been\r\nseparated at the cliff above the Gabon, where three of our hapless\r\nparty perished; the destruction of poor Captain Baylis and his wife;\r\nand how I feared that he, Hartly, was the seaman who had been\r\ntortured in the basket of thorns; of my slavery with Amoo, and his\r\nsquaw's felonious intentions with regard to my head; of my flight and\r\nrecapture--to all of which he listened with varying expressions of\r\nanger and honest grief, for the loss of so many brave English seamen.\r\n\r\n\"And now, Bob,\" added I, \"for your own story.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have little to relate that is not similar to what you have told\r\nme.  On that fatal day when our boat's crew were captured, and we\r\nwere separated, I was given by the King to a fetisher, or priest, a\r\nhideous old fellow who was covered with tattooing, and wore a copper\r\nring in each of his ears, and had the dorsal fin of a shark through\r\nhis nose, in sprit-sail-yard fashion.\r\n\r\n\"He employed me as his 'slavey,' in making and pointing arrows for\r\nthe warriors, as the manufacture of that commodity is a perquisite,\r\nor portion of the priestly trade in Gabon, for the tips of the arrows\r\nare poisoned by a combination of herbs, of which these fetishers\r\nalone possess, or pretend to possess, the knowledge, and with true\r\npriestcraft take especial good care to keep the secret among\r\nthemselves.  If the monstrous negro race hereabout have any religion,\r\nit consists of an adoration of the Devil, to whom they never tire of\r\nsacrificing wild animals, and occasionally each other--which is a\r\nsacrifice of much less consequence.\"\r\n\r\n\"Have they no belief in a Supreme Being?\"\r\n\r\n\"They know that some power superior to themselves created the skies\r\nand the earth; but because He is not an evil, but a good spirit, they\r\ndeem it better policy to appease the Devil, and so they work in _his_\r\nservice with all their might; and from all we have seen, they seem to\r\nhave the gift of doing so to the utmost.  My old master, the\r\nfetisher, professed to be on very intimate terms with Whirlwind Tom,\r\nand by his aid could always foretell what was to happen.\"\r\n\r\n\"How?\"\r\n\r\n\"He had an old pipkin perforated by three holes, through which he\r\nalleged the Devil spoke to him in whispers.  He was a vicious old\r\nwretch, and on one occasion _bit me_, which was no joke, as his teeth\r\nwere all filed, till they were sharp as those of a tiger cat.\r\n\r\n\"When not employed in selecting and cutting reeds for arrows, or\r\nfeathering, or pointing and poisoning them, this fetisher made me\r\nfish for him in a tributary of the Snake Elver, on the bank of which\r\nhe lived in a wigwam, which stood amid a grove of mimosa trees; and\r\nit resembled a huge punch-bowl or beehive, as it was built entirely\r\nof reeds and turf, plastered over with mud, which the sunshine had\r\nburned as white as Kentish chalk.\r\n\r\n\"There he led me a dog's life, for he was an ill-tempered old savage,\r\nwho hourly reviled, kicked, beat, and spat upon me, and as my beard\r\ngrew, he was wont to snatch and tear it, a proceeding, you must\r\nallow, very trying to one's temper.\r\n\r\n\"I perceived that we dwelt in a secluded place; that, save a warrior\r\nwho came from time to time for a bundle of arrows, no one ever\r\napproached us, so I resolved to escape.  In my fur socks, and a\r\nspecies of cummerbund which my master permitted me to wear, I\r\nsecreted a good stock of fishing apparatus, and selected a strong\r\njavelin with an iron point, well steeped in those precious poisonous\r\nstuffs which he was wont to brew in a pipkin.\r\n\r\n\"On the day I had finally made up my mind to slip my cable and be\r\noff, we were cutting reeds for arrow-shafts on the summit of a rock\r\nabove the Gabon River.  It was a lovely place, covered with feathery\r\nfern, bright scarlet geraniums, and flowering reeds, but I thought it\r\nlooked very like the place where I had last seen you, and where our\r\nthree shipmates perished in so barbarous a manner.  My heart became\r\nfilled with wild and dark thoughts, and I was neglecting my work,\r\nwhen suddenly my beard was grasped by the old tattooed fetisher, who\r\nsquirted a whole quid of some stuff full in my face, while raining a\r\nshower of blows upon my bare back with a _sjambok_, or supple-jack,\r\nof rhinoceros hide, which he always carried for my especial benefit.\r\n\r\n\"Flesh and blood could stand this no longer.\r\n\r\n\"We were close to the brink of the rock which overhung the stream\r\nthat rolled about a hundred feet below, so I gave his sooty reverence\r\na vigorous kick which shot him over like a crow, and souse he went\r\nthrough the air, with arms outspread.\r\n\r\n\"Whether he swam, sank, or fed some hungry crocodile, I know not, as\r\nI fled into the adjacent forest, and after lurking there\r\nlong--sleeping at night in the trees, as many a time I had done on\r\nthe swinging topsail-yard--I began, like you, to make for the coast\r\nto the westward, in the hope of seeing a ship venture into the Bight,\r\nor bearing toward the Pongos for fresh water.\r\n\r\n\"For many days and nights I wandered through forests of oak, cypress,\r\nmyrtle, and mimosa trees, enduring constantly the terror of being\r\ndevoured by wild animals, or falling again among savages who might\r\nforce me to render a severe account of the blessed fetisher I had\r\nkicked into the Gabon, till at last I found myself in a stately wood\r\nof sea-pines and _then_ I saw the ocean--the brave old ocean,\r\nJack!--the broad turnpike that could lead us home--the same ocean\r\nwhose waves swept up by the Nore and Greenwich Reach, to mingle their\r\nwaters with the Thames--and I laughed with joy, though its bosom was\r\nglistening under the vertical sun that scorches the coast of Guinea.\r\n\r\n\"All the memories of home and Old England swelled up within me as I\r\ngazed upon the girdle of her shores.  The sea! that\r\n\r\n  \"----glorious mirror where the Almighty's form\r\n  Glasses itself in tempests; in all time,\r\n  Calm or convulsed--in breeze, or gale, or storm,\r\n  Icing the pole, or in the torrid clime\r\n  Dark-heaving;--boundless, endless, and sublime!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LII.\r\n\r\nHARTLY'S STORY.\r\n\r\n\"When night fell, I came out of the lonely forest to gaze upon the\r\nmoonlit sea--not that the forest was very _lonely_, after all, as\r\nthere seemed to be at least fifty thousand baboons, monkeys, and\r\nsquirrels, which jabbered and leaped as if they had all gone mad, the\r\nwhole night, from tree to tree, and more than once the roar of a lion\r\ncame hollowly from a distance, under the lower branches of the pines.\r\n\r\n\"I sat upon a piece of detached rock, and, to seek for food, dropped\r\nmy fishing-line into the water.  There I soon caught a fish, on which\r\nI breakfasted next day, after spreading it, split open, on the rocks,\r\nwhere it was half cooked by the burning sun.  As for salt, there was\r\nplenty of that to be found among the crevices, where the heat had\r\nburned up the spray of the sea.\r\n\r\n\"For three nights I fished there with success and safety.  On the\r\nthird, I found at my line a fish of strange aspect, and, sailor-like,\r\nhad some doubts about breakfasting on it, but hunger soon ends all\r\nniceties.  When morning came, I sought a secluded part of the wood,\r\nand thought of lighting a little fire by rubbing dried branches\r\ntogether that I might broil my fish.\r\n\r\n\"Now, unless I could produce ocular proof of what I am about to say,\r\nyou would laugh at me for telling you a forecastle yarn, but the\r\nproof shall not be wanting.\r\n\r\n\"While opening and cleaning the fish at a spring, previous to\r\nbroiling it (an almost epicurean process to me), I found in its\r\nentrails--what?  MY RING--the ring given me by old Mother\r\nJensdochter, in Iceland, and which, as you remember, I lost a few\r\ndays after we left Sermersoak, when lending a hand to haul the\r\nmain-tack on board the _Leda_.\"\r\n\r\n\"Your ring!\" I exclaimed; \"this is like a bit of a fairy tale.\"\r\n\r\n\"My ring,\" he continued; \"and here it is, hid among my hair to\r\nconceal it from these greedy negroes, who would at once deprive me of\r\nit, and keep it as an ornament or amulet.\"\r\n\r\n\"This is most singular!\"\r\n\r\n\"Singular indeed, but on beholding it a new glow of hope filled my\r\nbreast.  I resolved to persevere in my efforts to escape, and so\r\nbecame too bold, for, venturing upon the open beach next day, I was\r\nseen by some savages belonging to the King of Biafra, who pursued and\r\nsoon made me their prisoner.  The rest of my story is nearly the same\r\nas your own, as my captors were with a caravan on their way to Benin,\r\nto attend the funeral of King Zabadie.\r\n\r\n\"I was severely treated by them.  Under a burning and vertical sun,\r\nthey employed me constantly in loading and unloading their\r\ndromedaries, or in pulling up esculent roots for them, and this was a\r\nserious task even to a hard-handed sailor, as these roots lay among\r\nthorny leaves and serrated grass, the blades of which were like\r\nnewly-sharpened saws.\r\n\r\n\"In the desert, the sand was so hot that it baked or roasted the eggs\r\nI stole or found at times, and was fain to eat in secret.  When my\r\nwork was over, I was always malevolently treated by the women, and\r\nmore especially by those little black imps, the children of the\r\ncaravan.  Their chief occupation was spitting at me, reviling and\r\npelting me with stones, bones, rotten gourds, and every missile that\r\ncame to hand.\r\n\r\n\"The women had a particular animosity to my beard, and the men\r\nhereabouts, like other darkies, not being troubled with much of that\r\ncommodity, joined them in the general desire for having it uprooted,\r\nbut I contrived to weather them by singeing it off.\r\n\r\n\"Every way I endured great misery.  I was not even permitted to drink\r\nof spring water, save from a calabash, which some of their dogs had\r\nused; and to tell the truth, I preferred to drink after the poor\r\ndoggies rather than after their beastly masters.\r\n\r\n\"Well, it would seem that His High Mightiness, the King of Biafra, is\r\na vassal of that more illustrious nigger the King of Benin; so, five\r\ndays ago, I was sent here, with many other miserable wretches, to\r\nbe--to be----\"\r\n\r\n\"What?\"\r\n\r\n\"Immolated on the grave of the late king, or buried within it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is such the custom?\" I asked, with indescribable dismay.\r\n\r\n\"Benin borders on the kingdom of Dahomey, and all the world knows how\r\nthe people there celebrate the obsequies of their kings.\"\r\n\r\n\"How?\"\r\n\r\n\"Frequently by the massacre of thousands.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hartly!  Hartly--we seem to go from bad to worse!\"\r\n\r\n\"I have been in the Pongo Isles, along the coast of Guinea, and in\r\nthe Bight of Benin before, and know all about the fiendish ways of\r\ntheir inhabitants.  Jack, did you observe a great hole in the\r\ncourtyard without?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes; and I can hear the shovels of the workers among the earth even\r\nnow.\"\r\n\r\n\"When a king dies here, his body is laid in a kind of great hall,\r\nwhich, like that at Dahomey, has a ceiling ornamented by the jawbones\r\nof his enemies.  There the very sleeping chambers of royalty are\r\npaved with human skulls, and have cornices entirely composed of them!\r\nZabadie, the King of Benin, is just dead, and his son proposes to\r\ninter him with unusual splendour.\"\r\n\r\n\"In that hole?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"But what is all this to us?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh,\" groaned Hartly, \"do you not understand--have I not told you?\r\nWhen a king dies here, a great grave is dug somewhere near the\r\npalace, and it must be hollowed so deep, that the diggers are drowned\r\nby the water which bursts in upon them, and there they lie, after\r\nconcluding their work.  In this great hole the fiadoors place the\r\nroyal corpse, dressed in all its barbaric finery, with a lance,\r\nsword, bow and arrows.  With the dead king are placed all his\r\nfavourites and servants, who are supposed to follow him to the other\r\nworld, and serve him there; and so proud are they of this\r\ndistinction, that it occasions the most violent disputes as to who\r\nshall have the honour of entombment, so blind and idolatrous is the\r\nveneration of these creatures for their dingy monarchs.  When the\r\nlast man has descended into the hole, an immense stone is placed over\r\nit; this is removed a few days after, and one of the great fiadoors\r\ninquires what are the tidings from beneath, adding,--\r\n\r\n\"'Who has gone to serve the king?'\r\n\r\n\"Then the poor wretches who are expiring below reply according to\r\ncircumstances.\r\n\r\n\"Day after day the stone is removed, and the same questions are\r\nasked, until all in that horrid pit have 'gone to serve the king,'\r\nand are dead of starvation and the noxious miasma of the vault.  When\r\nno voice responds to the inquiry of the fiadoor, the great stone is\r\nsecurely built over, a mighty fire is made upon it, a great festival\r\nis held, and the flesh of an elephant is roasted and given to the\r\nmultitude.\"\r\n\r\n\"And we--we----\"\r\n\r\n\"Are to be placed there among the slaves of the dead Zabadie.\"\r\n\r\nI remained silent, oppressed by the horror of what was before us; but\r\nHartly spoke again:--\r\n\r\n\"When a year has passed and gone, these wretches, in honour of their\r\ndead king and his dead followers, make a dreadful sacrifice of men\r\nand animals, till about five hundred are destroyed.  Most of the\r\nhuman victims are malefactors, or slaves taken in war.  If enough of\r\neither are not to be had, the king sends his female guards into the\r\nstreets at night to decoy and seize men till the number is made up.\"\r\n\r\nThis was a cheerful account of the state of society in the realm of\r\nBenin, and it afforded ample food for thrilling reflection and\r\nfruitless surmises.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LIII.\r\n\r\nTHE FEMALE GUARDS.\r\n\r\nYams, bananas, plantains, even boiled potatoes, and pipkins of pure\r\nspring water were liberally provided for us by our black female\r\nguardians, six of whom appeared once daily with our food and then\r\nretired, securing us with great bars of wood fastened outside in some\r\nfashion known only to themselves.\r\n\r\nThese Amazons were all well armed, and some were richly clad in\r\nbraided vests and petticoats of Dutch scarlet cloth.  Among them were\r\nseveral veteran female warriors, whose skins, by the process of time\r\nunder a tropical sun, had become spotted yellow and brown, like the\r\nhides of the leopard and panther.\r\n\r\nLight was admitted to our prison by a small square hole cut through\r\none of the trees which formed the wall, and from thence, when each\r\nsupported the other on his shoulders, we could see by turns the\r\nprogress of the diggers of the royal grave in the courtyard, and to\r\njudge by the quantity of earth and stones thrown up, the depth must\r\nhave been immense; and it seemed as if King Zabadie was going to the\r\nother world accompanied by all his wives, slaves, dromedaries, and\r\ndiabolical courtiers to boot.\r\n\r\nWe knew not _when_ this dreadful interment and immolation were to\r\ntake place.  When day dawned on us, we knew not if we should be\r\npermitted to see it close; when it closed, we knew not if we should\r\never behold another dawn.\r\n\r\nSo the wretched hours passed slowly, wearily on; and the close of the\r\nthird day found us still captives, and still unresolved on any\r\nexpedient to dree ourselves.\r\n\r\nSailor-like, Hartly was fertile in schemes and resources; but the\r\nformer were no sooner proposed than they were abandoned as\r\nimpracticable.\r\n\r\nOne time he suggested that we should endeavour to procure a light by\r\nfriction, set fire to the old wooden den in which we were confined,\r\nand then seek an escape amid the consequent confusion; at another, he\r\nproposed that we should close with our guards, wrest away a musket,\r\nkill one or two of them, and fight our way off; but how could we\r\nattack women?\r\n\r\n\"If once free of the palace, the town, and its suburbs----\" resumed\r\nhe.\r\n\r\n\"Free! how can we remain free, Hartly, in a land where our colour,\r\nwhich there is _no_ disguising, renders us constantly liable to\r\nrecognition, to attack, and recapture?\"\r\n\r\n\"True; but if we could only reach the coast, after having so dearly\r\nlearned circumspection, we might lurk in the woods.\"\r\n\r\n\"Without arms?\"\r\n\r\n\"We have done so before.  Then we might steal a canoe, or fashion\r\none, and put to sea.\"\r\n\r\n\"But the tools and the skins?\"\r\n\r\n\"We could steal both, as these fellows won't lend.\"\r\n\r\n\"Escape from this is necessary first: and in the pilfering visits you\r\nsuggest, we should certainly be retaken, together or singly; and then\r\nhow miserable would be the reflections of the survivor.\"\r\n\r\n\"Tut, Jack! unless we venture we shall never win.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, Hartly,\" said I, \"at last I have lost all hope!\"\r\n\r\n\"Do not say so; we are both too young to despair,\" was the sturdy\r\nresponse of the English sailor.\r\n\r\nWe thought of the old stereotyped modes of escape--by ropes or\r\nladders manufactured from shirts and trowsers, and by ample\r\nmelodramatic mantles; but such were impossible to us, who were nearly\r\nas nude as when we came into the world; by drugging our guards or\r\nsentinels; by bribing, coaxing, or assassinating them; but these, and\r\nall the thousand other modes by which heroic and romantic gentlemen,\r\nwhen in trouble or durance, effect escapes in novels and plays, were\r\nuseless or impracticable there.\r\n\r\nHartly, indeed, proposed to make love to one or two ladies of the\r\nroyal guard, and by gaining their confidence, to effect the\r\nappropriation of their muskets and ammunition.  But those dingy\r\nAmazons seemed of a very unapproachable nature; and moreover, were so\r\nthickly smeared with war-paint and vegetable oils, as to be too\r\nhideous in aspect and repulsive in odour to render the attempt at all\r\npleasant.\r\n\r\nSo the darkness of the third night closed upon us, and undecided as\r\nto any mode of escape, we sat gazing with longing eyes on the little\r\nbit of blue sky that was visible through the hole, which by day\r\nafforded light and air into our den.\r\n\r\nA single star of uncommon brilliance shone through it now, and so\r\nbrightly as to cast the form of the loophole upon the floor like a\r\nlittle white patch.\r\n\r\n\"If once we were out of this place,\" said Hartly, for the twentieth\r\ntime, \"I would certainly trust to my two hands and pair of heels for\r\ndoing the rest.\"\r\n\r\n\"The town walls seem a high palisade.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.  I had a good view of them for an hour and more on the unlucky\r\nday I first arrived in Benin.  And yet, Jack,\" he added, kindly, \"I\r\nam glad those devils brought me here, after all--we should never have\r\nmet again else.  The town walls are a double palisade, sparred over\r\non the outside and in--double sheathed a sailor would call it--and\r\nthen the whole is plastered over with red clay.\"\r\n\r\n\"Their height----\"\r\n\r\n\"Is not less than twelve feet; and at those parts of the town which\r\nare without a rampart, there is a ditch of great depth, full of slime\r\nand poisonous serpents, and bordered by an impassable hedge of\r\nbrambles, through which fire alone could make its way.\"\r\n\r\nIf I attempted to sleep, I was haunted by visions of being buried\r\nalive in that enormous tomb, from which there could be no\r\nescape--buried amid a hecatomb of hideous and sweltering negro\r\ncorpses and the dead royalty of a savage race.  The pictures my\r\nimagination drew of the future nearly distracted me; and I began to\r\nconsider whether it was not better, by rushing barehanded and unarmed\r\nupon our captors, to provoke a more speedy and merciful death under\r\ntheir knives, asseguys, or muskets; and failing an escape, Hartly\r\nagreed with me that it was a wiser alternative; but Heaven lent us\r\nits helping hand ere the third night was passed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LIV\r\n\r\nATTEMPT TO ESCAPE AGAIN.\r\n\r\nOn this night, for more than an hour, there was an unusual beating of\r\ntum-tums, and the chorus of some barbaric songs stole upon the wind\r\nat times from that quarter of the royal dwelling in which the wives\r\nof the late King Zabadie were enclosed.\r\n\r\nDuring the past day the digging in the courtyard had ceased; and this\r\ncircumstance, together with the sounds we heard (the adoration of\r\nsome great fetish, or idol), made us tremble in our hearts lest the\r\nfollowing day might see us placed in that more horrible prison, from\r\nwhence there could be no release but by death.\r\n\r\nWe mutually expressed our fears of this; and so absorbed were we in\r\nthis terrible surmise, that some time elapsed before we perceived\r\nthat the blue of the sky and the light of the stars had disappeared;\r\nthat a thick vapour had overspread both--that rain was pattering\r\nheavily on the flat roofs of the wooden city; and that thunder, the\r\ndeep, hoarse thunder of the tropics, which sounds as if it would rend\r\nthe earth in twain, was roaring athwart the darkened firmament.\r\n\r\nThe rain now poured down in such mighty torrents, that we listened to\r\nthe din of its fall in silent wonder; for it seemed as if once again\r\nthat \"all the fountains of the great deep had broken up, and the\r\nwindows of heaven were opened.\"\r\n\r\nEre long we felt the drops descending upon us, tepid and sulphureous,\r\nas the clay coating that covered the split canes, or lathing, which,\r\nformed the roof of our prison, soon became a puddle; while the straw\r\nand leaves on which we usually sat or reclined, were reduced to a\r\nmass of wetted mire.\r\n\r\nFor nearly an hour this continued, till our den became so thoroughly\r\nwet, that when the rain was over not a single dry spot could we find;\r\nand (as Hartly said) King Zabadie's trench in the courtyard would\r\nhave the water some fathoms deep in it by this time.\r\n\r\nOn the rain ceasing, and the clouds dispersing, which they did as\r\nsuddenly as the storm had come on, we saw the stars shining through a\r\nbreach which the moisture had made in the roof, and something like a\r\nbranch that was waving to and fro fell on my upturned face.\r\n\r\nI grasped it.\r\n\r\nIt was the strong sinewy tendril of a climbing convolvulus, which had\r\nfallen through the aperture.  I drew it down, so far as it would\r\ncome, and then _another_ branch fell in.  On this I called joyously\r\nto Hartly, that \"here were the first means of escape!\"\r\n\r\nWithout a moment's hesitation he grasped them, twisted them together,\r\nand with sailor-like agility swung himself up, hand over hand, till\r\nhe reached the crevice through which they had fallen.\r\n\r\nSupporting the whole weight of his body by the left hand, with the\r\nright he tore down a mass of the fragile roof, and swinging himself\r\nup, passed through and at length stood upon the outside.\r\n\r\n\"Now, Jack,\" said he, \"come up in the same fashion, hand over\r\nhand--it is just like going through the lubber's hole, instead of\r\nover the futtock shrouds.  Bravo! we'll weather this dead devil of a\r\nking and his armed wenches to boot.\"\r\n\r\nI dragged myself up by the twisted tendrils, but when near the hole\r\nshould have fallen to the ground, had not Hartly's strong and\r\nfriendly hands grasped and dragged me on to the roof, where for a\r\nlittle time we lay flat on our faces, panting alike with exertion and\r\nexcitement, and listening anxiously to hear if any guards or watchers\r\nwere near us.\r\n\r\nBy the starlight we could see the long rows of flat wooden huts which\r\ncomposed the palace divided into various courts.  At the distance of\r\nthree hundred yards from us, on our right, a ruddy glow that deepened\r\ninto crimson, then wavered, sunk, and flashed up again, revealed the\r\noutline of a monstrous fetish, or wooden idol, of hideous aspect,\r\nwhich the young King, his fiadoors, guards, and people were\r\nworshipping; and we could see the woolly heads bowed before it packed\r\nthick and close as cannon balls in Woolwich arsenal.\r\n\r\nThe long vista of the great street of huts, which stretches the\r\nentire length of the town, and is alleged to be three miles long, lay\r\nupon our left.\r\n\r\nWe had no guide to the ramparts or outskirts; but as the long extent\r\nof this street seemed empty and silent, our best chance of ultimate\r\nescape lay through it.\r\n\r\nAgain grasping the tendrils of the convolvulus, we slid down from the\r\nroof and reached the ground.  Robert Hartly dropped first.  When I\r\nwas following, the tendrils gave way, and I fell heavily, making thus\r\na noise which roused a large dog in an adjacent shed, where it barked\r\nfuriously; but as we lay close and still, it gradually ceased, and\r\ngrowled itself off to sleep again.\r\n\r\nWe were in a garden attached to the King's residence; and being (by\r\nour white skins) liable to immediate pursuit, capture, or\r\ndestruction, the moment we were seen--a contingency that would become\r\na certainty when day broke--we hurried through it, getting our legs\r\nand feet severely cut and torn by the flowers and prickly plants; but\r\nof this minor evil we had no heed at that time.\r\n\r\nA paling of split canes was soon surmounted, and once more we found\r\nourselves in the long street of Benin.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LV\r\n\r\nTHE FORMOSA.\r\n\r\n\"If once we are free from the town,\" said Hartly, \"we can find\r\nconcealment during the day, and by travelling at night may reach the\r\ncoast.  Then, if we can but obtain a canoe, and pass over to one of\r\nthe little isles in the Bight, we might remain there snugly enough,\r\ntill some ship ran in on the same unlucky errand which brought poor\r\nBaylis here.\"\r\n\r\n\"I pray it may end as you say.\"\r\n\r\n\"Courage, Jack!  Energy and faith will work miracles!\"\r\n\r\n\"But I imagine----\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't talk of imagination; it may only paralyse you by the fears it\r\nfashions, the danger it suggests; but hush!\"\r\n\r\nAt that moment the fire before the idol flared up broad and redly,\r\nand then the mingled roar of many voices swelled upon the night air.\r\n\r\nHigh above the hedge-rows or kraals for containing cattle, and the\r\nlines of countless huts, formed of turf, of wickered cane, and other\r\nrude materials which the wild vines, creepers, and convolvuli\r\nconcealed, rose the lurid flame that blazed before the misshapen god\r\nof Benin; and far across the flat city it cast the shadows of the\r\ntall giraffe trees, which grew in rows around the palace wall.\r\n\r\nThis red light mingled with the pale white lustre of the moon, which\r\nwas just rising at the horizon, from whence its splendour cast long\r\nand steady shadows across the streets, and thereby favoured alike our\r\nconcealment and escape.\r\n\r\nAs we hurried along the empty thoroughfares towards the town wall,\r\nHartly found at the door of a hut, a war-club, of which he\r\nimmediately took possession.  It was formed of teak-wood, black as\r\nebony, ponderously heavy, and its knob was covered by elaborate\r\ncarvings.\r\n\r\nWhile our hearts alternately glowed with hope, or sank with\r\napprehension, unseen we reached the high wall of wood and clay, and\r\nran alongside it, in search either of an outlet, or some means of\r\nsurmounting it; but no wild creepers, no gourd vines or climbing\r\nconvolvuli were permitted to grow there.\r\n\r\nWe had been out of our prison at least half-an-hour without being met\r\nor seen by a single negro.\r\n\r\nAt last we reached a place where, for more than a hundred feet, the\r\nwall was breached by the recent storm of wind and rain, which had\r\noverturned and beaten its ruins flat on the ground.\r\n\r\nWith mutual exclamations of joy, we were proceeding to clamber over\r\nthe fallen piles of rotten palisades and clay, when a wretched negro,\r\nwho appeared suddenly, on perceiving the whiteness of our skins in\r\nthe bright moonlight, uttered a loud cry of wonder or alarm!\r\n\r\nIn an instant we heard the clatter of steel, and at least a dozen of\r\nthe King's armed women issued from a kind of wooden tower which stood\r\nnear the fallen wall.\r\n\r\nHartly uttered something very like an oath; he struck the negro to\r\nthe earth by a blow of his club, and crying--\"Follow me, Jack!\"\r\nsprang over the scattered ruin, and rushed into the moonlit country\r\nbeyond.\r\n\r\nSwift of foot and active as these \"fair viragoes\" were, they proved\r\nno match for us in a race for life or death, especially when\r\nencumbered ty their muskets, asseguys, and red petticoats, which were\r\ncovered with heavy beads, lions' teeth, and grass braiding.\r\n\r\nTwo shots were fired after us, but where the balls went, Heaven only\r\nknows; fortunately, they fell far from us.\r\n\r\nOn we ran in the full blaze of the moonlight, bathed in perspiration,\r\nnow floundering among wild gourds and creeping plants, where little\r\nsnakes started up to hiss at us; anon over waste tracts, where lilies\r\nand geraniums covered all the wilderness; then among long and\r\nserrated grass, which cut our shins like saws and sabre-blades.  Next\r\nwe tore a passage through dense masses of wild canes, then through\r\nfields of maize, or rice, or millet, and often through cattle kraals,\r\ntill we reached a wood, where, after taking the precaution of running\r\nin _one_ direction in the full light of the moon, we turned and,\r\nhare-like, doubled in the _other_.\r\n\r\nBy this manoeuvre, I believe, we baffled our _fair_ pursuers, as we\r\nsaw no more of them for the remainder of that night or the following\r\nmorning, during the long hours of which we lay close to the earth,\r\nburied and hidden under a cool and shady mass of leaves and jungle.\r\n\r\nAnd there, without water to quench our thirst, and without other food\r\nthan a few wild berries that grew within arm's length of our lurking\r\nplace, we lay concealed during the whole of the next day.\r\n\r\nWhen night fell, Hartly climbed into a chestnut-tree, and after\r\nlooking carefully around him, uttered an exclamation of delight.\r\n\r\n\"I see the way we must steer, Jack,\" he added.\r\n\r\n\"You can see the ocean?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ay, or a large river, rippling in the moonlight to the horizon far\r\naway.\"\r\n\r\nA sigh of joy escaped me.\r\n\r\n\"And so, Jack, if our company is necessary to complete the happiness\r\nof King Zabadie in the next world, I am sorry for him, as he is\r\nlikely to take his long voyage without us.\"\r\n\r\nThe chestnut was lofty, and from it Hartly could see on one hand the\r\ndistant hills which form the termination of that mighty chain, the\r\nmountains of Kong, and end at the river Formosa.  On the other hand,\r\nbeyond the flat and open country, he could see the great river\r\nitself, flowing towards the Bight of Benin, along whose shores and by\r\nwhose waters lay all our ultimate hope of escape.\r\n\r\nWe bathed ourselves in a limpid pool to freshen and brace our nerves;\r\nI armed me with a cudgel formed of a young tree torn up by the roots;\r\nHartly had still his war-club; and resolving to travel only under\r\ncloud of night, as cautiously as possible, and to avoid all negro\r\ncamps and villages, we found the highway--if it could be called\r\nso--which leads from the city of Benin towards the Waree.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LVI.\r\n\r\nA PERILOUS JOURNEY.\r\n\r\nIn our ignorance of the wild country through which we travelled, our\r\nsole guide towards the sea was the course of the river Formosa, which\r\nrapidly widened into a mighty estuary, along the left bank of which\r\nwe proceeded with the utmost circumspection; and inspired by the\r\ntriple dread of being recaptured and killed by the natives, devoured\r\nby wild animals, or sinking under the heavy miasma which exhales from\r\nthe marshy creeks and isles of the uncounted river-mouths which there\r\npour their muddy tides into the Bight of Benin, laden with the\r\ndecaying vegetable débris of an unexplored world.\r\n\r\nBy various sounds which the wind swept after us at times, such as the\r\nbaying of dogs, and notes of cane horns, we feared a pursuit by the\r\npeople of Benin, and the sequel proved that our fears were but _too_\r\ntrue.\r\n\r\nWe were frequently bewildered by seeing large lakes, which we\r\nconceived to be the sea, till dawn of day would reveal their size,\r\nand the gigantic trees or walls of wavy reeds which surrounded their\r\nstagnant waters.\r\n\r\nHartly often beguiled the way by relating strange stories he had\r\nheard or read, and by the margin of one of those silent lakes in the\r\nwilderness he told me of the shattered hull of an ancient ship being\r\nfound, beached upon the bank of one of those inland waters in the\r\ncontinent of Africa.\r\n\r\n\"How came it to be cast up there?\" I asked, with surprise.\r\n\r\n\"Some alleged that it came through a subterraneous opening, a channel\r\nin the bowels of the earth, connected with the same vortex or\r\nwhirlpool which had sucked it down long years ago--the Maelstrom,\r\nperhaps, though many say that, like Charybdis, no such place exists.\r\nBut it sounds very like a bouncing yarn, such as one may hear at the\r\nRoyal Society, or under the leech of the foresail of a fine night,\r\nJack, when the middle watch are spinning their _twisters_.\"\r\n\r\nWe spent a whole night wearily and anxiously circumnavigating the\r\nbanks of one of those lakes whose waters were full of thick green\r\nslime, of sturdy reeds, and leaves of wondrous size and form; falling\r\ninto black quagmires and deep holes made by the clumsy hippopotami,\r\nand every instant in danger of being pounced upon by a panther or a\r\npoisonous snake for our intrusion upon their secluded domains.\r\n\r\nIt is in these lakes of Benin, and in those of the kingdom of Angola,\r\nthat the quaint old writer named Dapper (who must have been a very\r\nfanciful or credulous personage) relates he saw \"water animals which\r\nthe negroes call _ambisiangula_, and the Portuguese _pezze-moueller_.\r\nThese monsters are both male and female.  They are eight feet long\r\nand four broad, with short arms and long fingers of three joints,\r\nlike ours.  They have an oval head and eyes, a high forehead, a flat\r\nnose, and great mouth.  Snares are laid for them, and when caught,\r\nthey sigh and cry like women till they are killed by darts.  Their\r\nentrails and flesh are like those of hogs in scent, taste, and form.\r\n'Tis said the filings of certain skull-bones in the males, if mixed\r\nwith wine, are an excellent remedy against gravel, and the bone which\r\nextends towards the membrane of the ear is good against bad vapour,\r\nif we may believe the Portuguese.\"\r\n\r\nMaster Dapper then goes on to state, that of the ribs of this\r\nwonderful fish, particularly those on the left side, surgeons can\r\nmake a powder which will effectually stanch bleeding, and that\r\nbracelets made of them were worn for the preservation of health.\r\nAnother account, published in 1714, adds, that in the Cabinet of\r\nRarities at Leyden one of their _hands_ is preserved, and two others\r\nwere in the _Musæum Regium_ at Copenhagen.\r\n\r\nWe, however, never saw aught but the fibrous leaves of enormous\r\naquatic plants, large as table-cloths, floating on the water of these\r\nlakes, under the clear lustre of a lovely moon, that cast the shadows\r\nof the feathery palm and bending orange-trees from banks where the\r\nalligator dozed amid the slime, or the hippopotamus came to crop the\r\nherbage and bask in the rays of the sun when he rose above the\r\nfoliage of the vast untrodden forest.\r\n\r\nManfully we struggled on, supporting nature by such fruits and\r\nesculents as we found, especially yams, and on the sixth night after\r\nour escape, with a prayer of thankfulness, we found ourselves under\r\nthe friendly shelter of a chestnut grove, and close upon the shore of\r\nthe mighty sea.\r\n\r\nWe were now so scorched and burned by the sun, and so embrowned by\r\ndaily and nightly exposure, that we might very well have passed for a\r\ncouple of mulattoes, and so have claimed kindred with our tormentors.\r\n\r\nWe had now left the territories of Benin, and were in the land of\r\nWaree, which has a dingy sovereign of its own.  The whole of this\r\ndistrict is covered by wild forests, which in the wet season are\r\nfrequently converted into lakes and marshes, where the stems of the\r\ntrees are submerged for two or three feet in water.\r\n\r\nOpposite to where we lay concealed, and at the distance of a mile\r\nfrom us, we saw a little green island, having upon its summit a negro\r\nvillage, some of the inhabitants of which, when day broke, came over\r\nto the mainland with four canoes, which they moored or beached in a\r\ncreek not three hundred yards distant from where we lurked among some\r\nlong grass.\r\n\r\nThese negroes were sixteen in number, all armed with asseguys,\r\nmuskets, and bows, and they proceeded into the forest apparently to\r\nhunt.\r\n\r\nWe climbed into a leafy chestnut for security, and passed the entire\r\nday amid its branches, thus escaping the hunting party, several of\r\nwhom passed underneath us, on their way back to the canoes in which\r\nthey embarked, and returned to the island laden with game.\r\n\r\nThese canoes were large; each appeared to be a single tree hollowed\r\nout, and flattened in the bottom.  Hartly, who announced his\r\nintention of borrowing one _sans_ leave on the first available\r\nopportunity, said, that after being scooped out, straw was burned in\r\nthem to save the wood from being spoiled by worms.  They can be rowed\r\nswiftly, and are steered by a long spar, which acts as a rudder.  The\r\noars are usually made of teak-wood, and fashioned like spades.\r\n\r\nEach of these canoes had a round knob on its prow; and by this they\r\nwere pulled ashore with ease, and beached high and dry upon the thick\r\nmangrove leaves of the creek.\r\n\r\nWhen night fell again, I sank into a profound sleep among the\r\nbranches of our chestnut tree.  There was no danger of a tumble, we\r\nhad become so accustomed to roosting on such perches.\r\n\r\nDay dawned again, and we looked about us.\r\n\r\nAh! what were our emotions _then_ on seeing in the blue waters of the\r\nbay, and about two miles from the green island, _two vessels at\r\nanchor_--one a brig, with American colours flying; and the other a\r\nstately ship, with the broad scarlet ensign of Britain floating at\r\nher gaff peak!\r\n\r\nThere they rode proudly at their moorings; but we were destitute\r\nalike of means for reaching them or making signals; as yet all their\r\nboats were on board, and we could perceive no sign of any of them\r\nbeing despatched ashore.  Their topsails and topgallant sails were\r\nhanded; but their courses were only hauled up, and some of their fore\r\nand aft canvas hung loose in the brails.\r\n\r\nWe gazed at them with tearful and haggard eyes, our hearts swelling\r\nthe while with mingled hope and fear--hope that they might yet save,\r\nand fear that they might unwittingly sail and abandon us.\r\n\r\nWhile we were debating what was to be done, the four canoes with the\r\nsixteen negroes again shot off from the island village, and\r\ndisappeared among the mangroves of the creek; and soon after we saw\r\nthem, as on the previous day, pass, armed, into the wood to hunt.\r\n\r\n\"Now is our opportunity, Jack--now or never!\" cried Hartly, as he\r\ndropped lightly from the tree; \"let us make a rush at the canoes,\r\nseize one and shove off!\"\r\n\r\nI instantly followed his example; but, alas! we were too rash in our\r\ndesire to embark, for at the same instant we dropped from our\r\nperches, we found ourselves confronted by two of the savages, whom\r\nthe suddenness of our appearance seemed to fill with astonishment and\r\nirresolution.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LVII.\r\n\r\nPURSUIT AGAIN.\r\n\r\nWithout pausing for a moment to express friendly or other signs, we\r\nrushed down with headlong speed towards the creek, where the canoes\r\nlay beached upon the thick fringe of mangrove leaves, and eight of\r\nthe sixteen hunters pursued us; but notwithstanding the swiftness of\r\nfoot they possessed--a swiftness acquired by a savage and roving\r\nlife--we distanced them with ease, for despair seemed to lend us the\r\nstrength and speed of ostriches as we rushed towards the beach.\r\n\r\nAn asseguy, aimed with almost fatal precision, glanced over my left\r\nshoulder, and shivered as it sank into the turf beyond me.  Then a\r\nwar-club, thrown with fatal force and dexterity, struck poor Hartly\r\nbetween the shoulders, and nearly prostrated him; but in less than\r\ntwo minutes we were in the creek, and had one of the largest canoes\r\nafloat.\r\n\r\n\"In, in, Jack--leap in!\" cried Hartly, while he lightly and adroitly\r\npushed the other three into the water, and setting them all afloat to\r\ncut off pursuit, sprang in after me.\r\n\r\nHis presence of mind was most fortunate, for on the steep brow of an\r\neminence which overhung the creek on the side opposite to our more\r\nimmediate pursuers, there suddenly burst a storm of shrill yells and\r\ndiscordant shouts, mingled with the beating of tum-tums and the\r\nsnorting of ferocious dogs, as a number of Benin savages, who\r\ndoubtless had tracked us thither with the most fell intentions,\r\nrushed to the shore in pursuit--but thank Heaven, happily too late!\r\n\r\nHartly's sinewy hand had shot two of the canoes some thirty yards or\r\nso from the beach; and while towing a third by its bow-knob, he\r\nproceeded to row most vigorously with one of the spade-like paddles\r\nwhich lay in our craft.\r\n\r\nEre we got out of the wooded creek its water smoked and boiled under\r\nthe shower of missiles--arrows, asseguys, clubs, and stones--which\r\nwere sent after us, while five negroes and several dogs plunged in to\r\npursue or to slay.\r\n\r\nThese tracking dogs were animals of strange aspect--sharp-nosed, with\r\nskins spotted black and white, or red--they had slender legs, sharp\r\ntusks, and a low, but ferocious bark.\r\n\r\nWhile four of the negroes busied themselves in bringing back the\r\ndrifting canoes--an operation during which one of them was shot by\r\nthe musket of some blundering comrade--the fifth, a man of fierce and\r\nresolute bearing, having red and yellow circles painted round his\r\neyes, and a knife in his teeth, swam after us, accompanied by a dog,\r\nthe most formidable of the whole.\r\n\r\nSwiftly though our canoe shot through the water, and vigorously\r\nthough we paddled, they were soon alongside of us.  The dog had his\r\nfore paws, and the man his black hands, upon the gunnel at the same\r\nmoment.\r\n\r\nThe time was painfully critical!\r\n\r\nI struck the dog with my paddle, and broke both his fore legs; unable\r\nto swim, he floated away sinking, yelping, and drowning; while Hartly\r\nrelinquishing the canoe he was towing, dealt the painted savage--in\r\nwhom I recognised Amoo, my former master--a tremendous blow on the\r\nhead.  Though the latter proved _harder_ than the hard wood paddle,\r\nwhich was split and splintered, Amoo sank with a yell of rage and\r\npain.\r\n\r\nAfter the danger was past, I was pleased to see that he rose to the\r\nsurface again and reached the shore; for this negro chief was not, in\r\nsome respects, and apart from a general inclination to homicide,\r\nungenerous.\r\n\r\nThe three canoes were quickly crowded by armed warriors, and rowed\r\nout of the creek at a speed that bade fair soon to overhaul us,\r\nthough we paddled away, each on his own side, with all the rapidity\r\nour strength and our desperation enabled as to exert.\r\n\r\nWe were now entirely clear of the creek, and about a quarter of a\r\nmile from the shore, when a hearty English cheer rang across the\r\nwater towards us.\r\n\r\nOn turning and looking ahead, we saw two large and well-manned boats,\r\nwhich had been put off from the ship (the craft nearest the shore),\r\npulled rapidly towards us; while two rifles from the headmost one\r\nwere discharged into the canoes, as a hint for their owners to sheer\r\noff, which they immediately did with great expedition.\r\n\r\nWe were soon alongside of the nearest boat, the crew of which pulled\r\nus on board, canoe and all, continuing to cheer the while so lustily,\r\nthat some time elapsed before we could inform them that we were\r\ncountrymen.\r\n\r\nThe steersman then inquired whether there were any more fugitives\r\nashore.\r\n\r\nWe replied \"No;\" on which the boat's head was turned towards the\r\nship; the oars again fell into the water, and the creek soon lessened\r\nand melted, as it were, into the general scenery of the wooded shore.\r\n\r\nThe vessel by which we were so providentially rescued, proved to be\r\nthe _Havelock_, of London, a fine clipper ship of a thousand tons\r\nregister, belonging, by a singular coincidence, to my father--at\r\nleast, to the firm of Manly and Skrew, homeward bound from the Cape;\r\nbut which had been, like the barque of poor Captain Baylis, driven\r\nout of her course by the hurricane of the other night, and had\r\nanchored in the Bight to procure fresh water, and repair some\r\ntrifling damages.\r\n\r\nSoon her spars and hull (old England's wooden wall), a welcome sight,\r\nrose higher from the water as we pulled towards her; and as they\r\nrose, the low, level, and marshy shore we had left, with all its\r\nmangrove creeks and reedy lagunes--its wildernesses of giant leaves,\r\nand long and fibrous creepers--its dense jungles, where serpents\r\nhissed, monkeys chattered, and crocodiles laid their eggs; where the\r\ngreat yellow gourd and coarse serrated grass flourished under the\r\nfeathery palm and broad baobab trees, amid slime and miasma, that\r\ncarry death to the vitals of the European--soon all these diminished\r\nand sank astern, as our boat sped through the shining sea; and, ere\r\nlong, Robert Hartly and I shook each other's hands with honest warmth\r\nand joy, when we found ourselves among our own countrymen, treading a\r\ndeck of good English oak, with the old scarlet bunting floating from\r\nthe peak halyards above us.\r\n\r\nThree days the _Havelock_ remained in the bay; and during that time,\r\nyou may be assured, neither Hartly nor I had any wish to venture on\r\nshore.\r\n\r\nI shall never forget the glow of happiness that thrilled through me,\r\nwhen, on the third evening, the Captain gave orders to hoist the\r\nboats on board and prepare for sea.\r\n\r\n\"Man the windlass!\" was the cry; \"hands, up anchor!\"\r\n\r\nThe bars were inserted by sturdy hands in the huge beam, and then the\r\npauls clattered cheerily, while the iron cable rattled as it was\r\ndragged aft along the deck, and soon the great clipper ship came\r\nround with her head to the wind.\r\n\r\n\"Cast loose the courses; away aloft--shake out the topsails, and let\r\nfall!\"\r\n\r\nAnd anon the snowy canvas fell like white curtains on the lower\r\nspars, as the topsail yards ascended to the crosstrees.\r\n\r\n\"Heave on the cable--weigh!\" was the next order.\r\n\r\nTight as if its iron rings would snap like pack-thread grew the\r\nmighty chain, for strong hands and muscular arms were tugging with\r\nunited strength at the bars of bending ash.\r\n\r\n\"Together, lads--together--hurrah!\" cried Hartly, who had supplied\r\nhimself with a handspike.\r\n\r\n  \"Uptorn, reluctant, from its oozy cave,\r\n  The ponderous anchor rises o'er the wave.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd soon the great iron flukes were dripping with glittering brine,\r\nas the ring rattled at the cathead; then the yards were trimmed; the\r\nlarboard tacks were brought on board, and with a fine spanking\r\nbreeze, that came from the burning shores of Benin, our fleet clipper\r\nship bore away for Old England.\r\n\r\n\r\n* * * * *\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION.\r\n\r\nSuch were my adventures in the lands of snow and sunshine--the\r\nlatitudes of ice and fire!\r\n\r\nOn the 17th of December, exactly nine months after the day on which\r\nHartly and I had sailed through the Narrows of St. John, we found\r\nourselves bowling along the crowded and busy streets of London in a\r\nhackney cab, with our African canoe--all the property we\r\npossessed--lashed on the roof thereof.\r\n\r\nWe separated for a time at the Bank; he to look after another ship,\r\nand I--like he of old, who came to the husks and the swine trough--to\r\nreturn to my father's house at Peckham (a tamer and wiser youth than\r\nwhen I left it) and to the circle of my family, who had long since\r\ngone into mourning for me.\r\n\r\nI am delighted to add that my worthy Robert Hartly soon got another\r\nvessel.  As sole survivors of the crew of the _Leda_, we obtained,\r\nafter a world of trouble with the Red-tapists of the Circumlocution\r\nOffice, the 500_l._ offered by the Governor of Newfoundland for the\r\ndestruction of the _Black Schooner_.\r\n\r\nMy share I made over to Hartly, who invested it in the capital of his\r\nnew owner.\r\n\r\nHe still preserves, with religious care, the ring of old Mother\r\nJensdochter; and undeterred by all he has undergone, sails from\r\nBlackwall for China on the 10th of next month.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE END.",
