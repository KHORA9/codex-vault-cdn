TAYLOR\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\n\r\nThe almond (_Prunus communis_) is supposed to be native to the countries\r\naround the Mediterranean and at present the bulk of the world’s supply\r\nis produced in that region. It resembles the peach somewhat in manner of\r\ngrowth and character of blossoms and leaves, but the wood is much harder\r\nand the tree is longer-lived under equally favorable conditions. The\r\nfruit, instead of having a thick, fleshy pericarp as in the case of the\r\npeach, has a thin, leathery pericarp or hull, which splits on ripening\r\nand generally opens when dry, exposing the nut inside.\r\n\r\nCalifornia produces over 98 per cent of the entire American crop and has\r\ndone so for many years. During the period from 1900 to 1913 the number\r\nof bearing trees remained approximately the same, new plantings having\r\nreplaced old orchards that were being pulled out. The variation in\r\nCalifornia production from year to year prior to 1915, as shown in figure\r\n1, is due to seasonal variations rather than to change in acreage.\r\n\r\nImports into the United States from the Mediterranean countries are also\r\nshown in figure 1, the top line representing the total imports, the other\r\nlines, as indicated, showing the proportion of that total originating in\r\nthe three principal countries exporting to the United States. Previous to\r\n1912 the records of shelled and unshelled almonds were not kept separate.\r\nSince the records have been segregated, the percentages of shelled\r\nalmonds imported each year have been approximately as follows:\r\n\r\n                Per cent\r\n    1912-13        83\r\n    1913-14        70\r\n    1914-15        71\r\n    1915-16        82\r\n    1916-17        79\r\n                  ---\r\n        Average    77\r\n\r\nWith the 1915 crop the production in California entered upon what appears\r\nto be a long prospective increase. The large acreage of almonds set out\r\nin the last four or five years is the result of greatly improved market\r\nconditions due to the successful work of the California Almond Growers’\r\nExchange. The first of these new plantings are now coming into bearing,\r\nand each year for many years in the future will continue to see increased\r\nyields. Large acreages are still being planted so that the almond\r\nproduction in California bids fair to continue to grow.\r\n\r\nWithin the next few years California growers will, in all probability,\r\nbe forced to accept lower prices for their almonds than they are now\r\nreceiving. The American markets are fully supplied at present prices,\r\nyet constantly increasing acreage will inevitably result in a greatly\r\nincreased tonnage. European almonds are being produced at a lower net\r\ncost and can be laid down on the Atlantic Coast more cheaply than is\r\npossible with the California product. This brings the grower face to face\r\nwith the necessity of becoming more thoroughly familiar with the most\r\neconomical methods of production and marketing if they are to continue\r\nto make a profit. It is essential, therefore, that a careful study be\r\nmade of all the factors concerned in the growth, production and final\r\ndisposition of the almond crop.\r\n\r\n\r\nHABITS\r\n\r\nThe almond is the first of the deciduous fruit trees to start growth\r\nand come into bloom in the spring, and normally the last one to shed\r\nits leaves in the fall. In other words, it has a very short period of\r\nrest. When the trees are forced into premature dormancy by mites or\r\nlack of moisture, they soon reach the end of their normal rest period\r\nbefore the winter season is over. Then the first warm weather in spring\r\nwill bring the trees into blossom. In some cases where moisture and\r\ntemperature conditions are favorable late in the fall, they may actually\r\nblossom before the winter season. In young trees that have become dormant\r\nunusually early, the rest period may terminate and then the tips of the\r\nbranches resume growth and continue to slowly develop new leaves at the\r\nterminals throughout the winter. Trees which have been kept growing\r\nthriftily until the leaves have been forced to fall by the cold weather\r\nand frosts of winter, do not tend to blossom as early in the spring, nor\r\ndo they open under the influence of a few days of warm weather in late\r\nwinter or early spring.\r\n\r\nYoung trees blossom somewhat later than the older trees, and buds on\r\nsucker growth blossom later than the more mature portions of the same\r\ntree. The difference may amount to three or four days or almost a week.\r\nWell-grown trees carry large numbers of blossoms over the entire tree, as\r\nshown in figure 2.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 1.—IMPORTS OF ALMONDS INTO THE U.S.\r\n\r\nCrops of 1899 to 1917.]\r\n\r\nThe wood of the almond is very hard and strong, enabling the tree to bear\r\nthe weight of heavy crops where pruning has been given proper attention\r\nduring the formative period of the young tree. As with other fruit trees,\r\nthe almond is subject to heart-rot and care should always be exercised\r\nto prevent the checking and cracking of large wounds and consequent\r\ninfection with decay organisms. The hardness of the wood makes it the\r\nfinest kind of fuel, and when old orchards are being dug up the returns\r\nfrom the sale of wood often more than pay for the expense of digging and\r\ncutting up the trees and burning the brush.\r\n\r\nThe nuts are of two general classes—sweet and bitter almonds. The former\r\nis primarily the almond of commerce, though the latter is used largely\r\nin the manufacture of almond oil and almond flavoring, as well as in\r\nthe manufacture of prussic acid. The bitter almond is also used largely\r\nin nurseries as a rootstock upon which to bud the almond and some other\r\nfruits.\r\n\r\nFor a long time there has been considerable evidence to show that some\r\nvarieties are always self-sterile while a few are sometimes self-fertile.\r\nWork done in 1916 and 1917 by Tufts[1] shows that practically all\r\nvarieties are self-sterile and that some of the self-sterile varieties\r\nare also inter-sterile. In these tests the principal commercial varieties\r\nwere used. Blossoms of each variety were pollenized with pollen from\r\nits own blossoms and from each of the others. Checks were for natural\r\npollination with each variety. The important results of this work are\r\nbriefly summarized as follows:\r\n\r\nThe Nonpareil and I.X.L. are inter-sterile, although both are\r\ninter-fertile with the Ne Plus Ultra.\r\n\r\nThe Languedoc and Texas are inter-sterile.\r\n\r\nThe I.X.L. and Peerless are practically inter-sterile.\r\n\r\nThe California has proved the best pollenizer thus far tested, for all\r\nvarieties that bloom near it.\r\n\r\nThe Drake is inter-fertile with the Nonpareil, I.X.L., Ne Plus Ultra,\r\nPeerless and Jordan, the only ones tested.\r\n\r\nThe I.X.L. is inter-fertile with the Drake, Jordan, California,\r\nLanguedoc, Ne Plus Ultra and Texas.\r\n\r\nThe Ne Plus Ultra is inter-fertile with the California, Drake, I.X.L.,\r\nLanguedoc and Nonpareil.\r\n\r\n\r\nREQUIREMENTS\r\n\r\nWhile the almond is in many ways an easy tree to grow where conditions\r\nare favorable, it is more particular in its requirements than most\r\ncommon orchard fruits, and the grower may find it difficult to produce\r\na good, thrifty tree unless he chooses the proper location. Very often\r\nit will grow well and make a fine healthy tree, but owing to unfavorable\r\nconditions, will not bear regularly, if it all.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 2.—Seven-year-old Ne Plus Ultra almond in full bloom,\r\nat the University Farm, March, 1915, showing distribution of blossoms\r\nwell down into center of tree. Paper bags cover blossoms pollenized by\r\nhand.]\r\n\r\n\r\nCLIMATE\r\n\r\n_Heat._—Where the conditions of soil and moisture are favorable the\r\nalmond will endure the intense heat of the interior valleys and even of\r\nthe Imperial Valley, provided it is pruned properly to shade the main\r\nbranches so as to prevent sunburn. Where trees, by severe pruning, are\r\nopened up suddenly to the intense heat of the summer sun, almonds will\r\nsunburn, but if the necessary opening up is done gradually, the bark will\r\nbecome inured to the new conditions without danger. The nuts grow and\r\nripen more satisfactorily in the greater heat of the interior than along\r\nthe coast.\r\n\r\n_Frost._—The almond tree is hardy and will endure fully as much cold\r\nas the hardiest peach without injury. Trees are found growing well in\r\nIllinois, Ohio, New York and other Eastern states. In very favorable\r\nseasons they may even bear fruit, though this happens very seldom, due to\r\nthe extremely early habit of blooming before the spring frosts are over.\r\nThe first warm weather seems to start the trees into bloom, especially\r\nwhere the enforced dormant season of winter is very long.\r\n\r\nThe blossoms, on the other hand, are very tender. There is a great range\r\nin the degree of frost which will cause injury, depending largely on the\r\ncondition of the tree during the time that the fruit buds are forming and\r\ndeveloping, as well as on the duration and severity of the frost. Buds\r\nand blossoms on trees which have been forced into premature dormancy,\r\neither by lack of moisture or by severe attacks of red spider, are much\r\nmore susceptible to frost than those on trees which have continued\r\ngrowth late enough in the fall to provide for the proper development and\r\nmaturity of the buds. After differentiation of fruit buds commences in\r\nthe summer, the almond leaves should remain on the tree until late into\r\nthe fall in order to strengthen and develop the fruit buds and store up\r\nthe elaborated food material for the use of the buds in their normal\r\ndevelopment through the winter. Studies of almond buds gathered from\r\nhealthy trees which held their leaves until late fall frosts at Davis,\r\nshowed the first evidence of differentiation between fruit and flower\r\nbuds commencing about August 18, while the flower was not completely\r\ndeveloped until February 18 following. During the intervening time\r\ndevelopment proceeded unchecked through the winter even though the tree\r\nwas apparently dormant. During the time the crop is ripening on the\r\ntrees, little is done toward storing food material for the buds. If the\r\nleaves turn yellow or drop soon after harvest, the trees do not have the\r\nopportunity of storing a sufficient supply of plant food for their normal\r\nrequirements and the buds are insufficiently nourished during the winter\r\nperiod. The resulting buds are weakened and the indications are that they\r\nare unable to endure unfavorable climatic conditions in the spring, such\r\nas light frosts, continued cold weather or sudden changes from warm to\r\ncold weather.\r\n\r\nThe most tender stage in the blossoming and development of the young\r\nfruit seems to be immediately following the dropping of the calyx lobes\r\nfrom the young fruit as it first commences to swell rapidly. The blossom\r\nbecomes more and more tender as it opens out and reaches the above stage.\r\nAfter the young fruit has attained the size of a pea it rapidly becomes\r\nmore resistant to low temperatures. Blossoms with the petals exposed but\r\nnot yet opened have been known to stand temperatures of 24 degrees F.\r\nand blossoms with petals beginning to fall have stood 28 degrees F. No\r\nrecords are available as to the duration of these temperatures. In other\r\ncases, blossoms with the petals falling have been killed by temperatures\r\nof 30 and 31 degrees F. It must be remembered in this connection that\r\nthe almond blooms earlier than other orchard fruits and, therefore, is\r\noften subjected to much more severe frosts than occur during the blooming\r\nperiod of the later fruits. The greatest injury is likely to occur when a\r\nfrost follows one or more days of warm weather. When the mean temperature\r\nboth day and night remains low, frosts that might otherwise kill the\r\nflowers or setting fruit do no harm. This is what occurred in February,\r\n1917, at the University Farm, when repeated frosts at blooming time did\r\nno harm whatever.\r\n\r\nIn determining the desirability of a location in regard to its freedom\r\nfrom frost, the possibility of adequate air drainage is an important\r\nitem. For this reason the lands along the lower foothills immediately\r\nabove the floor of the valleys are ordinarily much less subject to\r\nfrost—because the cold air is free to drain away to the lower levels.\r\nGenerally the lands along the banks of streams which have been built\r\nup higher than the other lands of the Great Valleys through which they\r\nflow, are less subject to frost by reason of the natural flow of the\r\ncold air from them to the lower lands adjacent. For the same reason the\r\nplanting of almonds in the lower lands of the valleys, no matter how\r\nlarge the valleys may be, should be avoided, unless the locality has been\r\nthoroughly tested for a long period of years and has proved to be an\r\nexception to the rule because of some peculiar situation with favoring\r\nair currents or air drainage, such as might exist near a natural draw\r\nin the hills where the settling of the cold air in some portions of the\r\nadjacent valley might be prevented. Such locations are generally confined\r\nto very small areas. Oftentimes an opening or draw in the hills may\r\nserve as an outlet for the drainage of much colder air from considerably\r\nhigher elevations beyond, and then the danger from frost is very greatly\r\nincreased. This is very common where cañons act as drains to conduct the\r\ncold air from the high Sierras to the valleys below.\r\n\r\nVariable weather conditions, and especially as regards temperature in\r\nthe spring after growth commences, are highly undesirable. Warm weather\r\nimmediately followed by cold tends to produce sour-sap, fruit drop and\r\nkindred physiological ills. Oftentimes crops have been lost where no\r\nfrosts occurred after blooming commenced, simply due to sudden changes\r\nin the weather. However, it is highly probable that the greater portion\r\nof the trouble with fruit dropping, when of the size of peas or larger,\r\nis due to improper pollination. When the soil is not sufficiently well\r\ndrained at such a time, the sour-sap effect is greatly augmented.\r\n\r\n_Humidity._—Foggy or moist weather during ripening or harvesting is\r\nhighly objectionable. The nuts do not dry out rapidly enough on the trees\r\nto prevent the growth of molds and consequent darkening of the shells.\r\nThe nuts then require much heavier bleaching to brighten them properly\r\nfor the demands of the market. The damp weather prevents the rapid and\r\nthorough drying-out of the kernel; the sulphur fumes are absorbed by the\r\nmoist kernel and it sometimes becomes rancid before it is six months old.\r\n\r\nMuch damp weather in the spring encourages the growth of “shot-hole”\r\nfungus in the blossoms and fruit, often causing the loss of a\r\nconsiderable portion of the crop; the loss of leaf surface from the\r\nfungus infection is sometimes so great as to materially affect the vigor\r\nand vitality of the tree.\r\n\r\n_Rainfall._—It is impossible to state any definite amount of rainfall\r\nwhich will or will not maintain the trees and enable them to bear regular\r\ncrops of nuts, for so much depends not only on the variation in rainfall\r\nin different sections and in different years, as regards distribution\r\nthroughout the year, but also on the time and intensity of the fall,\r\nthe character of the weather following the rains and the ability of the\r\nsoil to receive and retain the rain that falls. Ordinarily, however,\r\nwith the above factors favorable, it is conceded that where the winter\r\nrainfall averages sixteen inches, almonds can generally be grown without\r\nsupplementing the water supply by irrigation, if the orchardist exercises\r\nreasonable care to conserve the moisture for the use of the trees. Where\r\nthe rainfall is inadequate some means of irrigation must be found to make\r\nup the deficit.\r\n\r\nIn some sections the annual rainfall varies greatly from year to year.\r\nOften it falls in such a way that a large proportion of it is lost in\r\nthe surface run-off. In many places the soil is so leachy that it is\r\nincapable of holding sufficient water for the use of the trees throughout\r\nthe summer, much of the winter rainfall being lost in the underground\r\ndrainage. Under either of these conditions, 40 inches of rainfall might\r\nnot be sufficient. Very often winter rains are followed by desiccating\r\nwinds so that a considerable portion of the rain which falls is lost by\r\nevaporation before anything can be done to hold it.\r\n\r\nContinued rainy, damp and cold weather at the time of blooming is\r\napt to sour the pollen or actually wash it away and thus prevent the\r\nfertilization of the blossoms, without which a crop is impossible.\r\nBees and other insects are the principal means of accomplishing the\r\npollination of almonds and such weather prevents them from working.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOIL\r\n\r\nThe almond is a deep-rooting tree and draws heavily upon the\r\nplant-nourishing elements of the soil. In ripening the large number of\r\nseeds which it is required to do, the tree must draw upon a considerable\r\narea of soil in order to supply the large amount of mineral matter that\r\nis needed to develop and mature the seeds. Analyses of almonds, as\r\ncompared with other commonly grown fruits and nuts, made by Colby,[2]\r\nshow that the almond leads in the total quantity of mineral matters\r\nwithdrawn from the soil. Colby further states that “The stone fruits fall\r\nmuch below the almond in total ash (mineral matter) excepting the olive,\r\nthe ash of which, however, is largely silica (nearly eight-tenths), an\r\ningredient so plentifully distributed in all soils that it is of no\r\npecuniary value.” Table I illustrates this statement.\r\n\r\nThese figures suggest the necessity of having a deep, rich, well-drained\r\nsoil for best results. For this reason and because of the deep-rooting\r\nhabit of the almond, the soil should be at least ten or twelve feet deep.\r\n\r\n_Hardpan._—Compacted substrata in the soil, whether they be hard clay\r\nlayers or cemented layers of silicious, ferruginous or calcareous origin,\r\nare objectionable. They not only prevent the roots from foraging to a\r\nconsiderable depth as they normally tend to do, but they prevent proper\r\ndrainage and aeration of the soil. If such layers are comparatively\r\nthin, that is, not more that two or three feet thick at the most, they\r\nmay be shattered with dynamite so as to allow the moisture, air and\r\nroots to penetrate to the better soil below. Hardpan, therefore, should\r\nbe avoided where it is too thick to be broken up or where it is not\r\nunderlaid by desirable soil.\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLE I\r\n\r\nSOIL INGREDIENTS EXTRACTED BY THE ALMOND AS COMPARED WITH OTHER ORCHARD\r\nTREES, AS SHOWN BY ANALYSIS OF 1000 LBS.

It not\r\nonly improves the physical condition of the soil, but assists drainage,\r\nmoisture retention and in rendering the plant food available in\r\nsufficient quantities for the use of the trees and for the maturing of\r\nfull crops of almonds. Many orchards have been very light producers year\r\nafter year because of a deficiency of humus in the soil.\r\n\r\n_Drainage._—The almond root is very particular as to its air and moisture\r\nrequirements in the soil. It will not endure standing water in the soil\r\nfor any length of time, especially during the growing season. Exclusion\r\nof air by excessive moisture is believed to be one of the most productive\r\ncauses of “sour-sap.” If allowed to continue for any length of time such\r\nconditions will cause the death of many or even all the roots and with\r\nthem the top.\r\n\r\n_Water Table._—A factor which is very commonly overlooked in connection\r\nwith the natural drainage of almond lands is the position of the water\r\ntable at different seasons of the year. Great care must be exercised in\r\nchoosing a location to be sure that the water table does not rise during\r\nthe summer. This is a very serious problem in many irrigated sections.\r\nWhere the water table during the winter months is less than 12 feet in\r\ndepth it is highly desirable to have as little fluctuation as possible.\r\nWhere fluctuations take place at a greater depth than 12 feet they are\r\nnot generally serious. The ideal condition is where the water table is\r\nhighest in the winter and quickly drops after the winter rains are over,\r\nto a depth of from 10 to 12 or 15 feet, remaining at that point during\r\nthe remainder of the growing season.\r\n\r\nThe soil in addition to being well drained, must be sufficiently\r\nretentive of moisture to supply the tree throughout a long, dry\r\ngrowing-season. If the soil will not retain a sufficient amount of the\r\nwinter and spring rains, recourse must be had to irrigation to supply the\r\ndeficiency.\r\n\r\n_Alkali._—Alkali lands are unsuited to almond culture and should be\r\ncarefully avoided.\r\n\r\nIn summarizing the soil requirements for almond culture, it may be\r\nstated that the ideal almond soil is a medium loam, uniform in texture,\r\nor nearly so, to a depth of at least twelve feet, well drained and\r\nyet retentive of moisture for the use of the tree during the summer.\r\nFortunately some of the best almond soils are situated along stream banks\r\nwhere the land is relatively high, and is, therefore, less subject to\r\nfrost. These streams flowing from the mountains and foothills have built\r\nup their own beds by the detritus brought from the hills. The coarser\r\nparticles being deposited first and nearest the stream itself, make the\r\nbetter drained soils, while the finer particles and the clays, deposited\r\nfurther back from the bank and in the lower lands, form the heavier soils.\r\n\r\nThe various conditions mentioned above are what the tree should have for\r\nbest conditions of growth and production. Oftentimes these conditions\r\nmay be approached without the soil being as deep as ten or twelve feet.\r\nExceptions to this will be mentioned in discussing the various almond\r\ndistricts of the state. It is essential to understand that trees,\r\nwhile growing and bearing on shallow soils in some localities, do so\r\nbecause of other exceptionally favorable conditions; either the soil is\r\nexceptionally well drained and yet sufficiently retentive of moisture, or\r\nthe humus in the soil is plentiful and the roots are able to work into\r\nthe underlying partially decomposed rock for moisture and some plant\r\nfood. In such localities the trees bear comparatively well because of the\r\nexceptional freedom from frost in the spring. Trees in these localities\r\nare generally smaller than on the deeper, richer soils, and where other\r\nconditions are equal, they bear crops in proportion to their size.\r\n\r\n\r\nALMOND DISTRICTS\r\n\r\nAlmonds are grown in nearly every county in California. In some counties\r\nthe few trees growing only occasionally succeed in producing a crop of\r\nnuts. There are sections in nearly all parts of the state, however,\r\nwhere they are a success commercially. Within these sections may be\r\nfound desirable and undesirable locations, depending upon soil and\r\nmoisture conditions and freedom from injurious frosts. Any discussion of\r\na district, therefore, does not necessarily mean that all lands within\r\nthat district are uniformly adapted to almond culture. On this account\r\nit is impossible to define a district any more closely than to name the\r\ncenter and include with it the outlying districts. In the same way it is\r\nsometimes impossible to say just where one district begins and another\r\nends. Adaptability of any special location can be determined only by\r\ncareful study of the land itself and diligent inquiry of those familiar\r\nwith it.\r\n\r\nAs far as possible, districts should be chosen where a definite cold\r\nwinter season exists. Warm weather and lack of freezing temperatures do\r\nnot hold the trees fully dormant and any frequent occurrence or unusual\r\ncontinuation of spring weather in the winter will start the trees into\r\ngrowth; cooler weather following, interferes with the normal flow of sap,\r\nresults in injury to the tree and blossoms, and often causes gumming\r\nof the nuts which mature. This condition exists largely in the lower\r\nelevations in Southern California and especially in the coastal portion,\r\nwhere the ameliorating influence of the Pacific is felt. This same\r\ncondition exists close to the coast in the northern portion of the state.\r\nFurther inland and at higher elevations the winters are more pronounced,\r\nand where these are not too severe or prolonged the almond thrives best.\r\n\r\n\r\nSACRAMENTO VALLEY AND FOOTHILL SECTIONS\r\n\r\nCommencing in Solano County, about eight miles northwest of Suisun and\r\nextending as far north as the southern end of Shasta County, close to\r\nthe base of the foothills on the west side of the Sacramento River, are\r\na large number of orchards on the bottom lands of the valley. These are\r\nfound principally on the higher lands along the banks of streams flowing\r\nfrom the Coast Range in a generally easterly direction to the Sacramento\r\nRiver. The two most important streams of this type are Putah Creek,\r\nforming the boundary between Yolo and Solano counties, and Cache Creek,\r\nflowing through the Capay Valley and across Yolo County to the Sacramento\r\nRiver.\r\n\r\nThese plantings being on the floor of the valley are more subject to\r\nfrost than the foothill plantings, but they have the advantage of being\r\non the rich valley soils, and while they may lose a crop occasionally\r\nfrom frosts, they make it up in the long run by the much larger growth of\r\nthe trees and their ability to produce larger yields. Many orchards do\r\nnot show any such ability to produce large crops, but such a failure must\r\nbe attributed to lack of pruning and care, rather than to any inherent\r\ninability of the large trees to produce nuts. Again, trees on the rich\r\nand moist bottom lands may be kept so vigorous and healthy by good care\r\nthat they are apparently able to endure lower temperatures than less\r\nvigorous trees on the shallow and poor upland soils where frosts are less\r\ncommon or severe.\r\n\r\nMany recent plantings have been made along the lower foothills on the\r\nwest side of the Sacramento Valley. The three most important districts\r\nwhere these plantings have been made are west of Dunnigan, Arbuckle\r\nand Corning. The plantings in these districts are mostly on a gravelly\r\nclay or clay loam soil which is not as rich nor generally as deep as\r\nthe bottom lands and, consequently, the trees are somewhat smaller, but\r\nthey have the advantage of freedom from spring frosts due to superior\r\nair drainage. The problem in this district is chiefly one of moisture\r\nretention by cultivation, as in most cases the growers are unable to get\r\nwater for irrigation at a reasonable cost, if at all.\r\n\r\nThe valley districts extend to Tehama County and down the east side of\r\nthe Sacramento River, the same as on the west side, the principal centers\r\nbeing at Chico, Durham, Liveoak, Pennington and Sutter. Parts of the\r\nLiveoak section are too low and many orchards have suffered from poor\r\ndrainage both of water and air.\r\n\r\nThe foothill sections on the east side are principally around Antelope,\r\nFairoaks and Orangevale in Sacramento County and the southern end of\r\nPlacer County. Here the danger from frost is slightly greater than on the\r\nwestern foothills because of the proximity to the snow-covered Sierra\r\nNevada Mountains. On the other hand, water from the Sierras renders\r\nirrigation possible at a reasonable cost, so the trees can be kept in\r\ngood condition. Care must be exercised here to avoid frost pockets. There\r\nis also danger of poor soil drainage in the swales.\r\n\r\n\r\nSAN JOAQUIN VALLEY AND FOOTHILL SECTIONS\r\n\r\nConditions here blend very much into those of the Sacramento Valley\r\nsections. Continuing south there are plantings around Acampo, Lodi,\r\nStockton, Linden, Ripon, Modesto and more scattered plantings farther up\r\nthe valley. The danger from spring frosts increases southward due to the\r\nearlier blooming of the trees. In some of these sections, notably around\r\nRipon and Modesto, the excessive use of irrigation water for alfalfa and\r\nother crops has resulted in a rise of the water table in many places\r\nuntil it is within a foot or two of the surface during the summer months,\r\nand in many other places comes to within four feet of the surface.\r\n\r\nOn the west side of the San Joaquin Valley the principal plantings have\r\nbeen in eastern Contra Costa County. Most of these orchards are of old\r\ntrees, planted from 15 to 30 years ago. In order to obtain satisfactory\r\nair and soil drainage the orchards were planted on the rolling hills,\r\nthe soil being nearly all blow-sand. Irrigation is too expensive to be\r\ninstalled on most of this land, and the problem in that section is to\r\nconserve moisture and at the same time hold the soil in place and prevent\r\nit from being carried away by the wind.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 3.—Typical hillside orchard of Jordan almonds near\r\nLos Gatos. Trees are variable in size, and some are missing. In the right\r\nforeground is a typical spot of missing trees resulting from Oak fungus\r\ninfection.]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE COAST SECTION\r\n\r\nAlmonds were planted quite extensively in past years in many of the coast\r\nvalleys, such as the Santa Clara, and where they were protected from the\r\ndirect influence of the moist ocean breezes, they apparently did well.\r\nLater most of these orchards were replaced by prunes and apricots as they\r\nwere generally found to be better paying crops in these valleys. On the\r\nhills, however, many typical hillside orchards remain, as shown in figure\r\n3.\r\n\r\nLocalities directly affected by the coast breezes have proved themselves\r\nto be unfit for commercial almond culture.\r\n\r\n\r\nINTERIOR COAST VALLEYS AND HILLS\r\n\r\nBack from the coast in the smaller valleys and on the hills where the\r\ncoast fogs seldom reach, many locations may be found where almonds are\r\nproducing successfully. These favorable localities are scattered, owing\r\nto lack of proper soil or moisture conditions.\r\n\r\n_Paso Robles District._—The one outstanding district in the coast hills\r\nwhere the almond is being grown successfully is in the country west of\r\nPaso Robles. There, at an elevation ranging from 900 to 2000 feet, where\r\nthere is sufficient air drainage to the considerably lower land near\r\nby, the almonds are doing well. These plantings are, in most cases, on\r\na comparatively heavy soil, sometimes approaching adobe, and underlaid\r\nby marl. This limestone formation is quite permeable to both water and\r\nthe roots of the trees, and the rock itself acts as a sponge and holds\r\nconsiderable quantities of moisture. On the other hand, consisting of\r\nsteep hills, the land is excellently drained and the trees seldom suffer\r\nfrom standing water around the roots.\r\n\r\nThe chief objection is that most of this land is very shallow, generally\r\nranging from two to four or five feet deep. In some places almonds are\r\nfound growing where the marl is so close to the surface as to be turned\r\nup by the plow. This makes the retention of moisture for the use of the\r\ntrees a serious problem. The trees do not attain large size on such soils\r\nand the nuts are inclined to be somewhat smaller than normal. The steep\r\ncharacter of much of the land makes tillage and spraying rather difficult\r\nand expensive. As long as the price of the land is kept down to a\r\nreasonable figure, the grower can afford to put more money into the care\r\nof both land and trees. It must be thoroughly understood that there are\r\nmany localities close to Paso Robles that are greatly subject to frost\r\nand hence not at all suited to almond culture. This is especially true of\r\nthe lands directly around and east of Paso Robles, and also of any of the\r\ncomparatively low lands throughout the district.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOUTHERN CALIFORNIA\r\n\r\nThe entire coast district of Southern California has practically proved\r\nitself to be unfitted for almond culture, except at elevations above 1500\r\nor 2000 feet. The limiting factor seems to be the lack of a sufficiently\r\ndefinite winter season at the lower elevations. Trees are inclined to\r\nbloom too early in the season or before the winter is over.\r\n\r\nAbove 1500 or 2000 feet the increased elevation gives a sufficiently\r\ndefinite cold winter season and the trees tend to blossom at more\r\nseasonable times. Aside from scattered plantings in the hills of San\r\nDiego County and a few orchards around Hemet and San Jacinto in Riverside\r\nCounty, the principal plantings are at Banning and in the Mojave Desert.\r\n\r\n_Banning District._—Within a radius of three miles of Banning, with an\r\naverage elevation of 2300 feet, where a plentiful supply of water is to\r\nbe had from the mountains to the north, are a large number of orchards\r\nranging in age from 2 to 29 years. The bulk of the plantings were made\r\nduring 1910 and 1911. This is the oldest district in southern California\r\nand has proved itself to be well fitted for almond culture.\r\n\r\n_Antelope Valley and Vicinity._—The old plantings in the Mojave Desert\r\nare few and far between. They have, however, served as an impetus for\r\nlarge plantings in recent years many of which have turned out to be\r\nfailures. This happened in many portions of Antelope Valley, west of\r\nLancaster, on the Southern Pacific Railroad in northern Los Angeles\r\nCounty. Many more of these plantings are young and still have to prove\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\nOrchard almond trees are never grown from seed, as they do not reproduce\r\ntrue to type, but are propagated by budding desirable varieties on\r\nseedling roots in the manner commonly employed in nursery practices for\r\nother stone fruits, like the peach. Every grower must decide, however, on\r\nwhat rootstocks he will plant his trees.\r\n\r\n\r\nROOTSTOCKS\r\n\r\nThere is much to learn yet regarding the behavior of the different\r\nroots under varying conditions when used as stock for the almond, but\r\nsufficient information has already been gathered to permit of certain\r\nrecommendations being made.\r\n\r\n_Almond Root._—The greatest proportion of almonds in this state are\r\non almond roots. Where the most desirable soil, moisture and drainage\r\nconditions exist it is best to select the almond root. It will live\r\nin comparatively dry soils, but cannot be expected to make a tree of\r\nlarge size or bear crops of nuts if the dry conditions continue. Where\r\nirrigation is not available, and the soil is deep and of proper texture,\r\nsufficient moisture may be retained in most years by cultivation to\r\nenable the tree to grow and bear fruit. When extra dry years come, the\r\nalmond root may not enable the tree to grow or produce any better than\r\nwould another kind of root, but it will carry the tree over a few dry\r\nseasons as well or better than any other. Then, when sufficient moisture\r\ndoes come, the almond root is ready to start the tree off in its normal\r\ncourse with the least loss of time.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 4.—Languedoc almond on peach[3] root; typical of\r\nother trees in same orchard, near Davis. Planted about forty-seven years\r\nbefore. Compare with trees in same orchard on Myrobalan root, as shown in\r\nFig. 5.]\r\n\r\nThe bitter almond is often recommended as being superior to the sweet\r\nalmond as a stock. This claim has never been proved. Experiments indicate\r\nthat there is fully as much variation between the bitter almond seedlings\r\ngrown from seed from different trees as there is between seedlings from\r\nbitter and sweet almonds. Both are equally subject to attack by gophers.\r\nThe grower’s chief object, therefore, should be to secure as healthy,\r\nvigorous trees as possible whether they be on sweet or bitter almond\r\nroots.\r\n\r\n_Peach Root._—Where the soil moisture is quite variable in different\r\nportions of the soil, or variable from time to time during the growing\r\nseason, the peach root will probably be most satisfactory. Soils less\r\nthan six or eight feet deep, or where gravelly or hardpan layers occur\r\nat less depths, are not satisfactory in most cases for the almond root,\r\nand under these conditions the peach root is better. The peach root is\r\na little better where irrigation is practiced during the summer, and\r\nespecially so where there is danger of slow drainage of excess water\r\nfrom the soil. The peach does not thrive with standing water around\r\nits roots, but will better withstand fluctuating or temporary extremes\r\nin water supply than the almond. Its union with the almond is entirely\r\nsatisfactory. See figure 4.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 5.—Languedoc almond on Myrobalan root, typical of\r\nmany other trees in same orchard, near Davis, planted about forty-seven\r\nyears ago. Compare with trees planted same time on peach root as shown in\r\nFig. 4.]\r\n\r\n_Davidiana Root._—Within the last five or six years the United States\r\nDepartment of Agriculture has introduced the seed of a Chinese peach,\r\n_Prunus davidiana_, the root of which is more resistant to alkali than\r\nthe ordinary peach. This has been found to unite readily with the almond,\r\nalthough experiments have not yet gone far enough to fully determine its\r\ntrue value. It gives promise, however, of being a very desirable stock\r\nfor sections where alkali may be troublesome.\r\n\r\n_Undesirable Roots._—The Myrobalan plum has frequently been recommended\r\nas a stock for the almond on poorly drained soils. The two make a strong\r\nunion, but the plum root grows much slower than the almond top, as\r\nindicated in figure 5. A comparison with figure 4, in which both trees\r\nare 48-year-old Languedoc, shows that the trees on Myrobalan root are\r\npinched-in below the union while those on peach root are swollen at the\r\nbase. Even young trees show the same pinching-in below the union. Almond\r\ntrees on Myrobalan root do not make as large trees nor do they bear\r\nsatisfactory crops in any portion of the state where it has been possible\r\nto compare them with the same varieties on other roots in similar\r\nsituations.\r\n\r\nThe apricot is occasionally recommended because of its strong, thrifty\r\ngrowth, but it is a mistake to attempt to use it, as the union is not\r\nsatisfactory. The trees grow thriftily for awhile, but before they reach\r\nfull bearing they either break off at the union or are blown over above\r\nthe union by moderate winds.\r\n\r\n\r\nTOP-WORKING OLD TREES\r\n\r\nOften through injudicious selection of varieties for original plantings,\r\nor for some other reason, it becomes desirable to work over old trees to\r\nmore desirable varieties. This may be done by budding or grafting. In\r\neither case the tree may be entirely reworked in one season or one-half\r\nmay be done the first season and the other half the next. The almond\r\nwill recover fully if completely deheaded to a height of from five to\r\nsix feet from the ground, provided it is not subjected to severe winds\r\nor excessive moisture in the soil. Winds are liable to break off the\r\nnew top during the first year or two. Where these are dangerous it may\r\nbe well to leave half of the tree on the windward side to be worked the\r\nsecond season. The remaining portions will help to serve as a wind-break\r\nuntil the top-worked portion of the tree has a chance to unite solidly\r\nwith the stub of the main branch to which it is attached. Where winds\r\nare not likely to do damage it is generally the most economical method\r\nto work over the entire tree at one time. If the roots are subjected to\r\nexcessive moisture conditions during the first season, the new growth may\r\nbe unusually vigorous and much more likely to be blown out as a result of\r\nthe heavy top and the poor attachment to the stub. “Sour-sap” may also\r\nbe very serious. Under such conditions leaving half the tree the first\r\nseason will enable it to distribute the growth more evenly with less\r\nundesirable forcing.\r\n\r\nWhether the top-working shall be done by budding or grafting depends\r\nlargely upon the wishes of the grower and the skill of the workman.\r\nGrafting will give a new tree more quickly than budding, because by the\r\nlatter method a year is lost in growing a supply of new wood on the stubs\r\ninto which the buds must be placed. By grafting, the new scions may start\r\ngrowing the first spring without any delay. Ordinarily the best method\r\nis to graft the trees the first winter and then, where the grafts fail\r\nto grow, buds may be inserted in the new growth which will come from\r\nthe stub. During the first two seasons especially, great care must be\r\nexercised to keep out the sprouts that interfere with the growth of the\r\nscions. At the same time, all water-sprouts should not be removed during\r\nthe first summer or there will not be sufficient leaf surface to perform\r\nthe necessary functions of the tree. In addition, the scions tend to grow\r\nso rankly that they will be top-heavy and much more liable to be blown\r\nout by the wind, as shown in figure 6. This may largely be prevented by\r\npinching the ends of the new scion growth during the early summer to\r\nforce lateral branching. At the end of the first year all water-sprouts\r\nshould be removed leaving nothing but the growth from the scions.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 6.—Twenty-seven-year-old trees deheaded two years\r\nbefore, showing the break-off of the new growth by strong winds.]\r\n\r\n\r\nPLANTING\r\n\r\nThe usual preparation given land for orchard purposes prior to planting\r\nshould be applied to land being prepared for almonds. Special care must\r\nbe given to insure thorough aeration of the subsoil by breaking up all\r\nhardpan, plow-pan or other compacted layers in the soil, where possible.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 7.—Almonds planted twelve feet apart. Trees in very\r\nweak condition and almost entirely defoliated by mites before harvest.\r\nThe few nuts ripening on the trees are small “sticktights.” Photo taken\r\nSeptember 21, 1915.]\r\n\r\n_Distance._—Almonds in most soils should be planted 30 × 30 feet on the\r\nsquare. In rich, deep soils the trees quickly fill the intervening space,\r\nthe roots occupying the entire soil area long before the tops touch. In\r\npoor, shallow soils, or soils deficient in available moisture, the trees\r\nmay not occupy the entire area above ground, but the roots will require\r\nmore horizontal feeding space to enable them to make the size trees and\r\nbear the crops that they should.\r\n\r\nTrees planted too close together often abstract the moisture from the\r\nsoil before the growing season is completed. This shortage of moisture,\r\nwith the aid of mites, commonly called red-spider, causes the loss of\r\nthe leaves long before they normally should drop. Under such conditions\r\nthe fruit buds are unable to make the vigorous growth which they should.\r\nThese weak buds are unable to endure the degree of frost or other\r\nunfavorable conditions that stronger ones withstand without serious\r\ninjury.\r\n\r\nThe trees must have plenty of sunlight and air. If planted too close, the\r\ntrees tend to grow too high, each one striving for the light which is\r\nonly available from above. In figure 7 the upward tendency of the trees\r\nis clearly shown. Such trees, if pruned as they ought to be, have a much\r\ngreater tendency to send out numerous water-sprouts than trees which\r\nhave plenty of room for the tops to expand laterally. After the tops of\r\nthe trees interlock and shut out the sunlight from the lower portions,\r\nthe smaller branches and fruit spurs in those parts gradually weaken\r\nand die, and eventually the entire crop is produced on or near the tops\r\nof the trees, where direct sunlight is available, as shown in figure 7.\r\nThe excessive upward growth of the trees, with the consequent forcing of\r\nthe fruit bearing to the top, not only greatly increases the difficulty\r\nand cost of pruning, spraying and harvesting, but reduces the possible\r\nbearing surface of the trees.\r\n\r\n_Setting the Trees._—The utmost care is necessary in setting out the\r\ntrees to secure a uniform stand of vigorous trees. The trees are planted\r\nmuch the same as other deciduous orchard trees, but care must be used to\r\nspread the roots well to secure a thorough compacting of the soil around\r\nall the roots, and to see that the trees are not planted deeper than they\r\nwere in the nursery.\r\n\r\n\r\nCULTURE\r\n\r\n_Soil Handling._—The almond is one of the most exacting of fruits as\r\nregards its cultivation. The assumption is very often made by growers\r\nthat because the tree will live through periods of prolonged drouth, it\r\nwill also thrive under careless or poor methods of cultivation. That\r\nthis is entirely erroneous may be inferred from the fact previously\r\nreferred to that the almond draws more heavily upon the plant food of\r\nthe soil for the ripening of its crop than any of the common orchard\r\nfruits. Experience has abundantly proved that many almond orchards are\r\nnot bearing profitable crops because the requisite soil constituents are\r\nnot available in sufficient quantities during the long growing season.\r\nThe reasons for this condition may be one or several. First, there may\r\nnot be sufficient moisture available throughout the season, or it may not\r\nbe distributed evenly or in sufficient amounts throughout the entire soil\r\narea. Second, there may be insufficient aeration of the soil; and third,\r\nthere may not be sufficient humus to fix the soluble plant food in the\r\nsoil and render it readily available as needed by the roots.\r\n\r\nProper distribution of moisture in sufficient quantities is essential to\r\nsecure adequate solution of the mineral elements needed by the roots for\r\nthe use of the tree in all its parts. Sufficient aeration is needed to\r\nprovide for the normal oxidation and weathering of the soil particles,\r\nand also for the respiration of the roots themselves.\r\n\r\nThere seems to be no question about the value of spring plowing and\r\ncultivation to put the soil in good physical condition, but many growers\r\napparently question the value of summer cultivation. Though the surface\r\nof the soil appears to be unchanged after a period of several months,\r\nthe fact is entirely overlooked that the structure of the mulch has been\r\ngradually changed and capillarity to the surface has been restored. The\r\nresult is that evaporation takes place so rapidly from soils in such a\r\ncondition, as well as from the leaves of the trees, that long before the\r\nend of the season the moisture is practically gone.\r\n\r\nThe methods and tools used are much the same as for other orchard\r\ntrees and it is only necessary to call attention to items likely to\r\nbe neglected. Spring plowing should vary in depth from year to year\r\nto avoid the formation of an impervious plow-sole. The depth to plow\r\nranges from a minimum of six inches to ten or twelve inches or more as\r\ndesirable. Summer cultivation should be kept up at least once a month,\r\nand preferably oftener, throughout the summer months and the soil should\r\nbe stirred to a depth of four inches to provide a mulch sufficient to\r\nhold the moisture effectively in the hot, dry climates where almonds are\r\ngrown. The actual number of cultivations necessary will depend on the\r\ntypes of soil. Harness with projecting hames or broad singletrees or with\r\nprojections of any kind to catch on the branches or bark of the trees\r\nshould never be used in an orchard.\r\n\r\n_Cover Crops._—Constant cultivation throughout the summer allows the\r\nhumus to be burned out of the surface soil and, by hindering the growth\r\nof vegetation, prevents the addition of a natural supply of humus to\r\nreplace that which has been lost. It is necessary, therefore, that some\r\nartificial means be used to supply the deficiency. The annual growth of\r\nwinter cover crops to be plowed in during the spring, while not entirely\r\nreplacing the humus burned out in the summer, serves to reduce the annual\r\nloss and at the same time assists materially in improving the texture of\r\nthe soil.\r\n\r\nA shade crop, such as alfalfa, may be grown successfully in mature\r\norchards where irrigation water is available, and where perfect drainage\r\nof surface and subsoil can be maintained. During the first four or five\r\nyears or more such a crop is generally a detriment to the almond trees,\r\nbut after the trees reach maturity it may be beneficial in securing\r\nbetter drainage and aeration of the soil by the penetration of the\r\nnumerous roots to considerable depths and their consequent decay when\r\nit is plowed in. Alfalfa also supplies nitrogen to the soil and thus\r\ngradually increases the fertility. The great danger with such a crop is\r\nthat the orchardist is apt to irrigate for the alfalfa at the expense of\r\nthe trees because of the quicker returns from the former. In deep, rich\r\nsoils the cuttings of alfalfa may be removed from the land, though the\r\nlast cutting in the fall should be allowed to remain on the land. Where\r\nthis is done, a natural mulch is obtained which helps to increase the\r\nsupply of humus. If the soil is poor and lacking in humus it is better\r\nto leave more cuttings of the alfalfa on the ground to decay. As this\r\ncontinues the soil becomes, through the increased accumulations of humus,\r\nmore permeable and yet more retentive of moisture, and less irrigation\r\nwill serve the trees more effectively.\r\n\r\nDuring the early spring a well-established stand of alfalfa may assist so\r\nmaterially in getting rid of the excess water in the soil that sour-sap,\r\nfruit drop and kindred ills resulting from the unseasonable warm weather\r\nwhile the ground is filled with water and the trees are starting into\r\ngrowth, may be greatly reduced or avoided entirely.\r\n\r\n_Irrigation._—Water for irrigating almonds must always be used with great\r\ncare whether it be in summer or winter. All water should be so applied\r\nthat it will readily spread through the soil and not remain in excessive\r\nquantities for any length of time. Water should not be applied during\r\nblossoming or setting of the fruit in the spring or within a week or\r\nmore of harvest. On the other hand, water applied just before the hulls\r\ncommence to open, where the soil has become too dry, greatly reduces\r\nthe number of sticktights, or almonds in which the hulls stick to the\r\nripening nuts without opening.\r\n\r\n_Fertilization._—Little or no systematic work has been done up to the\r\npresent time in the use of commercial fertilizers on almonds. The use of\r\nbarnyard manure is desirable wherever obtainable. The value of almond\r\nhulls as fertilizers is doubtful because of the difficulty of bringing\r\nabout their thorough decay when applied in sufficient quantities to be\r\nworth while. The use of lime to correct soil acidity and for improving\r\nthe texture of heavy soils will be found desirable where this is\r\nobtainable at reasonable rates.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRUNING\r\n\r\nThe almond trees normally set a larger number of fruit buds than they\r\nare capable of maturing. The number of blossoms set on a healthy tree to\r\nproduce a full crop will be generally not more than 20 per cent of the\r\ntotal number which opened in the spring, and oftentimes much less. It has\r\nfrequently been noted that trees which are somewhat lacking in vigor are\r\ninclined to set a larger number of fruit buds than those that are strong\r\nand vigorous. The normal set of blossoms on a young, vigorous tree is\r\nshown in figure 2. The result is that with the sub-normal strength of\r\nsuch trees being distributed among the extra number of fruit buds, the\r\nlatter are not able to develop into the strong, healthy buds they should.\r\nThe results of such conditions have been discussed on pages 23, bottom,\r\nand 24, top. One of the best means of securing and keeping healthy,\r\nproductive trees is by careful, thoughtful and systematic pruning. The\r\ntreatment given most of the almond orchards would indicate that the\r\ngrowers consider pruning to be one of the least important of the cultural\r\npractices.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 8.—Typical Drake almond tree in University Farm\r\norchard; nine years old.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 9.—Typical Languedoc almond tree in University Farm\r\norchard; nine years old.]\r\n\r\nTo be most effective, pruning must be followed systematically throughout\r\nthe entire life of the tree. The details of the practice will vary\r\ngreatly, depending on the soil, moisture and climatic conditions\r\nsurrounding the tree, as well as other treatment accorded it. At planting\r\ntime, it is generally agreed that the tree should be cut back to between\r\n18 and 24 inches from the ground to reduce the top to correspond to the\r\nshortened root system and to form a low head for the tree. A low head is\r\ndesirable to avoid sunburn of the trunk and to keep the tree within easy\r\nreach for pruning, spraying and harvesting. During the first summer in\r\nthe orchard much can be done to obtain a well-balanced head, to get the\r\nmain branches well spaced on the trunk, and to prevent crowding later on,\r\nby pinching out all undesirable growth as fast as it appears and forcing\r\nthe growth into those parts of the tree which are to remain. If these\r\nbranches tend to grow too long and willowy, they may be made to branch\r\nby pinching back when they attain the desired height. In this way, if\r\nthe tree can be kept growing vigorously, the beginning of an excellent\r\nfoundation framework may be developed the first year.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 10.—Typical Nonpareil almond tree in University\r\nFarm orchard; nine years old. Note numerous water sprouts which must be\r\nremoved.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 11.—Typical I.X.L. almond tree in University Farm\r\norchard; nine years old.]\r\n\r\nThe following winter, when the tree is one year old in the orchard, if it\r\nhas grown too vigorously and the branches are too long and willowy and\r\nnot properly branched it should be headed back to improve the shape and\r\nsymmetry of the whole tree. If the tree has not made sufficient growth\r\nto give it a properly shaped head, it should also be cut back even more\r\nseverely than in the case of the too vigorous growth. There sometimes\r\nwill be trees that during the first year will develop such a well-shaped\r\nand stocky frame that no further heading will be necessary, all future\r\npruning being limited to thinning out undesirable and interfering\r\nbranches. Ordinarily, however, it will be highly desirable or necessary\r\nto continue the practice of heading-in the yearling tree at least. As\r\nlong as heading continues it will pay to give special attention to\r\npinching and thinning the following summer. In this way the frame of the\r\ntree may be developed more quickly and the future necessity of heading be\r\nmaterially lessened. In rich bottom lands where moisture is plentiful,\r\nheading may be necessary when the tree is two, three and, in extreme\r\ncases, 4 years old, in order to spread the tree and prevent it from\r\ngrowing too high. The necessity for this can only be determined by a\r\ncareful study of the tree itself and the conditions surrounding it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 12.—Typical Ne Plus Ultra almond tree in University\r\nFarm orchard; nine years old.]\r\n\r\nThe habit of growth of a given variety will have a great deal to\r\ndo with the number of seasons during which heading back will be\r\npracticed. Spreading varieties, such as the Drake (see figure 8), if\r\nmaking a strong, vigorous growth, should not be headed any longer than\r\nis necessary to start a sufficient number of main branches. Every\r\nopportunity must be given the trees of this variety to grow as upright as\r\npossible. Summer pruning of the drooping, undesirable branches wherever\r\nthey develop, will help to increase the growth of the upright branches.\r\nBy pruning as far as possible to inside buds, every opportunity will be\r\ngiven the trees to grow upward. If trees of such varieties make a poor,\r\nweak growth, a very heavy heading will force them to make a stronger and\r\nmore vigorous growth the following season, provided any unfavorable soil\r\nand moisture conditions are corrected. Care must be exercised with these\r\ntrees to prevent the downward growth of any of the branches by pruning\r\nthem off during the summer, as suggested above. As soon as a strong,\r\nupright growth is started, no further heading should be done, but careful\r\nthinning by removal of undesirable growth should be continued.\r\n\r\nUpright varieties, such as the Languedoc (see figure 9) and Texas, may\r\nrequire heading for a longer time than the more spreading varieties. It\r\nis necessary to force them to branch nearer the ground and they should be\r\nmade to spread as much as possible. Pruning to outside buds and summer\r\npinching will aid materially and make it unnecessary to head back after\r\nthe first two or three years. Where this is not done, heading may be\r\nnecessary at the end of the third and possibly to the fourth year if the\r\ntree is in rich, deep, moist soil. Another advantage of summer pinching\r\nand removal of water sprouts is that the trees are not allowed to develop\r\na thick “crow’s nest” at the end of the stubs where heading back was done\r\nthe previous winter, making the following winter pruning much easier. The\r\nhabit of growth of each of the principal commercial varieties is shown in\r\nfigures 8 to 12, inclusive.\r\n\r\nAfter the main framework is properly started, further pruning will be\r\nlimited to thinning out the tree to keep it sufficiently open and to\r\nremove all dead, injured and interfering branches. Most of the growth\r\nafter this will continue from the ends of the remaining branches and as\r\nthe trees grow higher they will tend to branch more. All cross branches\r\nand those that are liable to interfere later should be taken out. All\r\nwater sprouts should be removed unless they are needed to fill in\r\nundesirable open spaces.\r\n\r\nAs the trees come into full bearing and approach maturity, the vigorous\r\nwood growth will cease and will be replaced by a moderate yearly growth\r\nof wood which will gradually increase the size of the tree without making\r\nit unmanageable. Where trees continue to make excessive wood growth when\r\nthey should be bearing, the trouble may generally be traced to unusually\r\nrich, moist soil, a condition which pruning cannot correct. It may be\r\nbeneficial to stop pruning altogether for a few years, which will be\r\nlikely to throw the trees into heavy bearing and thus stop excessive wood\r\ngrowth. After the bearing habit is once thoroughly established, moderate\r\npruning may be done to get the tree back into proper shape.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 13.—Eighteen-year-old almond trees deheaded six feet\r\nfrom ground, in the Armstrong orchard near Davis. Stubs painted with\r\nwhite lead. Photo taken February, 1914. Compare with Figs. 14 to 19.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 14.—Same trees as Fig. 13, showing growth one year\r\nafter deheading. Photo taken March, 1915. On some of the trees long\r\nstubs were left near the bottom of the trees from which new growth never\r\nstarted. Only a moderate thinning out of the new growth was done.]\r\n\r\nThe mature tree should have its branches so spaced that sunlight may\r\npenetrate to all portions of the tree. This is necessary for the\r\ncontinued health and life of the fruit spurs in the lower portions of the\r\ntree. If the top is too dense, the new growth can only continue in the\r\ntop and outer portions of the tree where sunlight can penetrate. When\r\nan adventitious bud does start in the center of the tree it immediately\r\nmakes a strong vigorous growth to reach the sunlight far above. Such a\r\ngrowth is called a water sprout. If the trees are kept so pruned that\r\nthe shadow on the ground during the greater part of the day is mottled\r\nwith sunlight while the trees are in full leaf, the small growth may be\r\nmaintained in the center and the bearing surface greatly increased. Where\r\nthis is done the trees will not tend to grow as high as they otherwise\r\nwould. Pruning of healthy, mature trees, therefore, will be limited to\r\nthinning out and removal of dead and interfering branches and water\r\nsprouts. Portions which grow too high may be brought down by removal\r\nclose to a shorter and lower branch. By giving this treatment only to\r\nsmall portions of the tree during a season, the forcing of water sprouts\r\nmay be largely avoided.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 15.—Same trees as Fig. 14, showing two seasons’\r\ngrowth after deheading. Photo taken February, 1916, just after pruning\r\nhad been completed.]\r\n\r\nOld trees, or those which, through improper care or neglect have become\r\nweak and unfruitful, may often be rejuvenated. One method is to dehead\r\nthem to a height of about six feet from the ground and to grow entirely\r\nnew tops. By this method about three years are required to bring the\r\ntrees back to the point where they are again ready to bear profitable\r\ncrops. The objections to this are that it is an expensive operation, no\r\ncrops whatever can be obtained for two years, organisms of decay may gain\r\nentrance to the wood, and sometimes the sudden shock to the tree renders\r\nit more subject to physiological disturbances. The advantages are that if\r\nproper care is given the trees during the rebuilding period, much better\r\nformed trees may be obtained and a finer quality of bearing wood be\r\nsecured throughout the new trees.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 16.—Same trees as Fig. 14, showing three seasons’\r\ngrowth after deheading. Photo taken January, 1917. No pruning done this\r\nwinter. Trees have not borne more than a few almonds but have a good set\r\nof fruit buds.]\r\n\r\nTo be successful, the deheading process must be followed by careful\r\nthinning of the sprouts that will be forced from the old stubs. If too\r\nmuch thinning is done the first year, there is danger of those that are\r\nleft becoming top-heavy and breaking off. This is especially troublesome\r\nin sections subject to strong winds. The new sprouts should be left\r\nsufficiently thick to help support each other, and yet should be thinned\r\nout sufficiently to prevent crowding. At the end of the first season’s\r\ngrowth, further trimming should be done, giving those branches best\r\nadapted for the frame of the new tree a chance to take the lead the\r\nfollowing season. A sufficient amount of secondary growth should be left\r\nto help take care of the excessive sap flow in the shortened tree, but\r\nthis must be watched to see that it does not interfere with the growth\r\nwhich is to be permanent. By the end of the second year, the permanent\r\nbranches should be sufficiently strong and firm to permit the entire\r\nremoval of all other branches. The amount of wood to be left until the\r\nend of the second season and then removed is clearly shown in figures 18\r\nand 19. The third year the tree should make sufficient growth to restore\r\nvery largely the equilibrium between the top and the roots and also\r\nproduce a small crop. Figures 13 to 17, inclusive, illustrate the steps\r\nin rejuvenating an orchard by the deheading process from the start until\r\nthe trees are again in commercial bearing.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 17.—Same trees as Fig. 14, showing four seasons’\r\ngrowth after deheading. Photo taken December, 1917, after trees have\r\nborne their first good crop of nuts. No pruning has been done since\r\nJanuary, 1916.]\r\n\r\nSome growers find it more desirable to cut back only one-half of each\r\ntree at a time. The shock to the tree is not so great and the liability\r\nto sour-sap correspondingly less. The halves of the tree left standing\r\nact as a wind-break to prevent the blowing out of the new growth, which\r\nat the same time is less likely to break off because of its slower and\r\nmore sturdy growth. The objection to this method is that the other half\r\nmust be cut off the following winter and the shaping process is more or\r\nless uneven, and necessarily continued over a long time.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 18.—Two seasons’ growth before pruning of almond\r\ntrees deheaded six feet from the ground January, 1914, in the Armstrong\r\norchard near Davis. The tree was only moderately thinned at the end of\r\nthe first year. Photo taken February 2, 1916.]\r\n\r\nThe other method of rejuvenation is to thin out gradually the dead and\r\nweakened branches in the old trees and rebuild them gradually, removing\r\nonly a small portion in any one year. As the new growth is forced out it\r\nis used to replace the old wood where possible. Such a system requires\r\nmore cutting of small branches high up in the tree to be successful, for\r\nit must not be opened to sunlight too suddenly or sunburn will result.\r\nThe cutting of a large number of small branches tends to force the growth\r\nof new buds over a large proportion of the tree and if done moderately\r\nmany of these will quickly develop into fruiting wood. Eventually, many\r\nlarge branches may have to be removed as newer branches are developed,\r\nbut this must necessarily be a comparatively gradual process. The\r\nadvantages of this method are that there is no sudden shock to the tree,\r\nthere is always sufficient leaf surface to care for any extra supply of\r\nsap which may be forced into the tree by unfavorable weather and moisture\r\nconditions, and cropping will be continuous.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 19.—Same tree as Fig. 18 after pruning. The actual\r\ntime required to prune this tree was twenty-five minutes. Photo taken\r\nFebruary, 1916.]\r\n\r\nWhatever method of rejuvenation is used, the grower must be very\r\ncareful from the first to protect all large wounds by some paint or\r\nother protective covering, such as asphaltum, to prevent checking and\r\nweathering and to keep decay from getting started and working into the\r\nheart of the tree. With very large wounds a protective covering must be\r\nkept on during the remainder of the life of the tree, or until the wounds\r\nheal over completely.\r\n\r\n\r\nINFLUENCE OF CULTURE ON NUTS\r\n\r\nThe effect of culture on the nuts is quite marked. All varieties will\r\nvary in size from season to season and in different orchards during the\r\nsame season, depending on the plant food and moisture supply available\r\nduring the time the nuts are maturing. Some varieties, notably the\r\nNonpareil, will vary more in size than in plumpness, while other\r\nvarieties, like the Ne Plus Ultra, are more inclined to produce somewhat\r\nshriveled kernels and imperfectly developed shells and the variation\r\nin size will not be as great. As the trees bear larger crops the nuts\r\nproduced are inclined to be smaller. Young, vigorous trees with a light\r\ncrop will often produce unusually large nuts with comparatively thin\r\nshells. The value of a variety, therefore, will depend largely upon its\r\nbehavior after the trees reach full maturity and bearing.\r\n\r\n\r\nORCHARD HEATING FOR FROST PREVENTION\r\n\r\nThere has been considerable interest in protecting almonds from frost\r\nbecause of the frequency with which they are subjected to such conditions\r\nby reason of their early blossoming habit. The use of orchard heaters\r\nin some districts has become a common and successful practice. It is\r\npossible to economically control several degrees of frost for three or\r\nfour nights or possibly more by a judicious use of heaters.\r\n\r\nThe best type of heater for almond orchards has not been thoroughly\r\nworked out as yet, but the reservoir heaters of the Bolton or Hamilton\r\ntype have been commonly and successfully used. The former are commonly\r\nknown as “pots.” At least 75 one or two-gallon heaters per acre are\r\nnecessary to control temperatures as low as 27 or 28 degrees F. Probably\r\nnot over 100 pots to an acre would be needed at most. Double the number\r\nof pots should be placed around the outside row of the orchard to afford\r\nthe necessary protection.\r\n\r\nThe gravity of oil best suited for orchard heating is between 20 and 25\r\ndegrees Beaumé. It is essential that it be as free from impurities, such\r\nas sulphur, as possible. During the spring of 1917, orchard heating was\r\ndone very extensively in some districts of the state while the trees\r\nwere approaching full bloom. As the season progressed it became apparent\r\nthat some serious injury had been done by the heating, for the bulk of\r\nthe blossoms fell off and the leaves turned yellow in streaks as if\r\nburned by an acid. The appearance was exactly as if the particles of\r\nsoot settling on the pistils of the flowers and on the young leaves had\r\nabsorbed sulphur dioxide gas (a product of oil combustion where sulphur\r\nis contained in the oil) and that the dews uniting with it to form\r\nsulphurous acid had done the damage. Had the heating been done later and\r\nonly after the trees had passed full bloom, it is possible that a much\r\nheavier set of nuts might have been secured, since the small fruits,\r\nwhere they had formed, seemed to have been uninjured, only the pistils\r\nof the flowers having been affected, probably preventing pollination and\r\nfertilization of the ovules.\r\n\r\nThe time of heating is therefore a very important point. Almond blossoms\r\nbecome progressively more tender to frost as they advance in development.\r\nWith their petals on they are not nearly as tender as they are after the\r\npetals have fallen. They reach their most tender stage after the calyx\r\nshucks have fallen from the young expanding fruits before they are the\r\nsize of a pea. Ordinarily, orchard heating before the trees have passed\r\nfull bloom is a waste of time and material and is often injurious. The\r\nmost needed time is for a period of two or three weeks after the bulk of\r\nthe petals have fallen, unless temperatures below 28 or 29 degrees are\r\nencountered before that time.\r\n\r\n\r\nCROP HANDLING\r\n\r\n_Harvesting._—The harvesting of the crop should be commenced as soon\r\nas the hulls have opened to their fullest extent and no time should be\r\nlost in completing the work. The nuts in the center of the tree are the\r\nlast ones to ripen and so may be used as indicators. If harvesting is\r\ncommenced early, the nuts will cling to the tree rather tenaciously and\r\nknocking must be very vigorous in order to shake them loose. On the other\r\nhand, if they are allowed to hang too long after ripening, a number of\r\ndifficulties may be encountered. They may be blown to the ground by light\r\nwinds and the cost of gathering be increased, as quite commonly occurs\r\nwith the Peerless, or the hulls may dry up and in doing so, close around\r\nthe nuts to a greater or less extent and add to the cost and difficulty\r\nof hulling. This is most noticeable with the Nonpareil. Strong winds\r\nwill break off a great many of the nuts of any of the varieties, and\r\npromptness is doubly essential where there is any likelihood of such\r\nwinds during the harvest season. Depredations by birds may cause serious\r\nlosses, especially with the soft and papershell varieties. Infestation by\r\nworms may often be quite serious in the papershell varieties when they\r\nare allowed to hang too long. In case of damp or foggy weather the shells\r\nturn dark and sometimes commence to mildew, requiring heavier bleaching\r\nto brighten them sufficiently for market demands. Rain stains can never\r\nbe removed entirely by bleaching.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 20.—Harvesting almonds by knocking onto sheets spread\r\non ground.]\r\n\r\nThe crop is gathered by knocking the ripened nuts and hulls with long\r\npoles onto sheets spread on the ground under the trees. The knocking\r\nshould be done near the portions of the trees where the nuts are borne\r\nand by striking a number of light, quick blows, rather than by a heavy\r\nblow aimed to jar a large branch. This will avoid injury to the bark by\r\nbruising and will accomplish the work in less time. The blows should\r\nalways be delivered squarely against the branch. A glancing blow will\r\ntear the bark and break off a great many fruit spurs, thus reducing the\r\nbearing surface for the next year. For this reason harvesters must be\r\nwatched closely all the time to insure the proper use of the poles. The\r\nsheets, two in number, are spread under the trees so they will overlap\r\nand catch all the nuts that fall (see figure 20). When sufficiently\r\nloaded with nuts to make dragging the sheets from one tree to another\r\ndifficult, they are emptied into lug boxes and sent to the huller.\r\n\r\nThe character of the harvesting equipment may vary considerably,\r\ndepending on the acreage, character of trees and ground, time required,\r\ncapital available, and the personal wishes of the owner. Some growers\r\nuse heavy poles of pine, spruce or fir, while others prefer the lighter\r\nbamboo poles. The heavy poles are from 1½ to 2 inches in diameter at the\r\nbase and from ¾ to 1 inch in diameter at the top. Experience has shown\r\nthat poles of this type over 20 feet in length become unwieldy, and not\r\nonly swing slowly but do more damage because of the greater difficulty of\r\ncontrol. Most growers prefer 16-foot poles with a few 20-foot ones for\r\nuse in the tops of the taller trees. Where the tops cannot be reached\r\nwith these, the men climb into the trees with shorter poles. The bamboo\r\npoles used are about 24 feet long and because of their lightness can be\r\nused with greater speed. Bamboo poles with short internodes should be\r\nselected as they are less likely to break. Breakage may also be reduced\r\nby storing the poles in a cool place where drying-out will not be\r\nexcessive.\r\n\r\nThe sheets used are made of duck ranging in weight from 7 to 12 ounces.\r\nSizes of single sheets range from 12 × 24 to 24 × 48 feet. Sheets need\r\nnot be much longer than the longest diameter of the tree. To prevent\r\nmildew and rotting of the fabric in the sheets they should be boiled in\r\na solution of tannin before being used. The life of sheets thus treated\r\nwill be greatly lengthened.\r\n\r\nA number of growers have provided special contrivances by which sheets\r\nare mounted on sleds or wheels so they are not dragged on the ground. The\r\nprincipal objection to such an arrangement is that the sled or wheeled\r\nframe must be made in two sections, one for each side of the tree, thus\r\nincreasing the cost of the operation because the horses can be used for\r\nnothing else while harvesting is in progress. On the other hand, by the\r\ndragging process sheets will not last more than two or three seasons,\r\nwhereas by the sled or wagon method they will last from six to ten years\r\nlonger. The two wagons shown in figure 21, each 12 × 24 feet, cost\r\nbetween $60 and $70, about 1914. The canvas portion is of 8-ounce duck.\r\nBy this method the knockers can gather ten lug boxes before emptying.\r\nThe work can be done much faster with wagons. With the sleds a sheet is\r\nfastened lengthwise on the right-hand side of one and another on the\r\nleft-hand side of the other sled.\r\n\r\n_Hulling._—After harvesting, the almonds, hulls and all are taken while\r\nstill moist, to the huller to separate them. If they become dry before\r\nhulling they must be dipped in water or the shells will be broken. All\r\nhulling was formerly done by hand, and this is still done where only\r\nsmall lots are to be handled. The invention of machinery for this purpose\r\nhas reduced the cost of hulling from 60 to 80 per cent, for most outfits\r\nseparate the hulls from the nuts before they leave the machine. Some of\r\nthe hand hullers consist simply of the hulling portion of the large power\r\nmachines without the separating screens. These cost about one-sixth or\r\none-seventh as much as the large machines, and where a man has a small\r\nacreage and is too far away to haul to a large huller, a hand machine\r\nwill greatly facilitate the work, even though the final separation must\r\nbe done by hand.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 21.—Portable almond sheets mounted on wheels as used\r\nby N. J. Lund, Oakdale, California, 1916.]\r\n\r\nThere are three different kinds of hulling and separating machines now\r\nin operation in California, all invented by California almond growers.\r\nThe first one made was the Read “Sure-Pop” almond huller. This is now\r\nmanufactured in three sizes by the Schmeiser Manufacturing Company,\r\nDavis, California. The No. 3 huller does not have any separating device\r\nand is generally best for orchards of less than ten acres. It may be\r\noperated by hand or by a small engine or motor. The No. 2 hullers both\r\nhull and separate and are operated only by power. They should pay in\r\norchards of ten acres or more. The No. 1 is the largest made and is for\r\nuse in large orchards of 100 acres or more.\r\n\r\nThe Beach huller is of more recent origin, having been in use only since\r\n1895. It was invented by J. E. Beach of Fairoaks, California, and is\r\nbeing manufactured by him. The two sizes of this machine are both power\r\noutfits; they are doing satisfactory work at the present time.\r\n\r\nThe third huller is that made by C. U. Reams of Suisun. One of the first\r\nmachines made by him was in 1897, and is now in working order at the F.\r\nO. Scarlett ranch, northeast of Suisun, and is doing satisfactory work.\r\nSince the first invention, Reams has made a number of improvements both\r\nin the method of hulling and of separating.\r\n\r\nMany growers do not have sufficient tonnage to enable them to afford\r\na commercial huller, and yet hulling by hand is a slow and tedious\r\npractice. C. E. Sedgwick, Manager of the Solano District of the Pacific\r\nGas and Electric Company, located at Dixon, California, conceived the\r\nidea of using a centrifugal blower operated by a small electric motor\r\nto do the hulling. His description of this outfit, quoted from “Pacific\r\nService Magazine,” April, 1916, page 393, after making two small\r\ncorrections given by Mr. Sedgwick, is as follows:\r\n\r\n    The equipment consists of a No. 0 Sturtevant exhaust fan belted\r\n    to a 1 h.p. motor. The nuts are fed into the suction side of\r\n    the fan where they are picked up by the runner, hurled against\r\n    the casing of the fan and blown out of the discharge into a box.\r\n\r\n    The motor consumes three-tenths kilowatts when almonds are\r\n    fed into the fan at the rate of a lug box every minutes and\r\n    one-half, so that the power cost, even at the 8-cent lighting\r\n    rate, is only 2.4 cents per hour. The fan costs about $20,\r\n    while the regular commercial hullers run as high as $750.\r\n\r\nFurther inquiry from Mr. Sedgwick developed the fact that this huller has\r\noperated for three seasons on a 20-acre almond orchard. Peerless, Drake\r\nand I.X.L. almonds were all hulled successfully. Nonpareils have not\r\nas yet been tried. The speed most commonly used was about 1200 r.p.m.,\r\nthough it varied somewhat with the different varieties. He believes that\r\na larger size would do better work.\r\n\r\nThe efficiency of any of the above hullers depends largely upon the speed\r\nof the machine and upon the condition of the almonds in the hulls. If\r\nthe machine runs too fast the almonds will be broken and injured, and if\r\nit runs too slowly many of the almonds are not hulled. If the almonds\r\nare allowed to hang on the trees too long, or if allowed to lie around\r\ntoo long after being harvested, the hulls become dry and leathery and\r\nthe difficulty of hulling is greatly increased. Dipping in water in such\r\ncases may help to overcome this difficulty to a limited extent.\r\n\r\nThe papershell varieties, notably the Nonpareil, are much more difficult\r\nto hull without breaking the shells than are the harder shelled\r\nvarieties. The Nonpareil hull has a tendency to close around the nut on\r\ndrying, making hulling under such circumstances very difficult.\r\n\r\nOften when the moisture supply in the soil is exhausted before the nuts\r\nare ripe, or where the loss of leaf surface due to mites is serious\r\nprior to ripening, the hulls open only slightly or not at all, but dry\r\nonto the shell of the nut. Such “sticktights” can only be disposed of\r\nprofitably by allowing them to thoroughly dry, when they are cracked and\r\nsold as kernels.\r\n\r\nAfter the hulling operation all almonds must be gone over by hand to\r\nremove pieces of hulls and inferior or gummy nuts. Where canvas drapers\r\nare not available for sorting directly from the huller, the nuts are\r\npiled in hoppers and sorted on benches beneath them.\r\n\r\n_Drying._—Immediately following the sorting, the nuts are spread on trays\r\nand thoroughly dried in the sun. In the interior valleys during the hot,\r\ndry weather the nuts will sometimes dry so quickly that by the time the\r\nsorting from hoppers is completed the nuts are sufficiently dry to be\r\nbleached. The grower must be certain, however, that such is the case\r\nbefore any bleaching is done, or before the almonds are delivered to the\r\nwarehouses for bleaching. The nuts are sufficiently dry when the kernels\r\nwill break without bending. Quick drying is essential to prevent the\r\nexcessive darkening of the shell.\r\n\r\n_Bleaching._—When thoroughly dry the nuts are ready for bleaching. The\r\nshells are first moistened by spraying with water or subjecting them to\r\nlow-pressure steam for 10 to 20 minutes. The shells are then subjected\r\nto the fumes of burning sulphur for 10 to 30 minutes. The sulphur fumes\r\nare absorbed by the moisture on the shells, which are bleached to a\r\nbright yellow color. After bleaching the nuts are exposed to the air for\r\na few moments to allow them to dry. The market demands a nut that has\r\nbeen sufficiently bleached to give it a bright, clean, yellow color.\r\nAn over-bleached almond is equally objectionable because of its pale,\r\nsickly, yellow or whitish color. Over-steaming or sulphuring permits\r\nexcessive penetration of the sulphur fumes, with the resulting danger\r\nof absorption by the kernel. While this may not be noticeable in the\r\nflavor, it will eventually result in premature deterioration in the form\r\nof rancidity. Unbleached almonds remain edible much longer than bleached\r\nalmonds in nearly every case. Ordinarily one to three pounds of the best\r\nflowers of sulphur is required to bleach a ton of almonds. Lump sulphur\r\nis not satisfactory.\r\n\r\n_Sacking._—During the preliminary handling of almonds ordinary grain\r\nsacks are commonly used. After bleaching, in which condition they are\r\nready for market, they are put in standard almond bags, measuring 20 × 40\r\ninches and weighing 1¼ pounds. The weight of a bag of almonds will vary,\r\ndepending not only on the variety but also on the year in which the crop\r\nwas grown and the locality in which it was produced. For selling purposes\r\nthe California Almond Growers’ Exchange estimates weights of different\r\nvarieties to be as follows: Nonpareil about 85 pounds to the bag; I.X.L.\r\nabout 80 pounds; Ne Plus Ultra, 75 pounds; Drake, 90 to 100 pounds;\r\nLanguedoc, 100 pounds; and hardshell almonds, 100 to 120 pounds.\r\n\r\n_Shelling._—Within the past two years the shelling of almonds has taken a\r\nprominent place in the consideration of the men charged with the disposal\r\nof the almond crop. The increasing popularity of shelled almonds, and\r\nthe limited market for unshelled almonds, makes the production of more\r\nshelled almonds imperative in view of the prospects of greatly increased\r\nproduction in the next few years. A small proportion of the shelled\r\nalmonds marketed are those accidentally shelled during the hulling\r\nprocess. This probably averages less than 30 pounds per ton of almonds\r\nhulled in ordinary years.\r\n\r\nThe varieties most commonly shelled are the papershells. They are much\r\nmore easily shelled without breaking the kernels than are the harder\r\nshelled varieties and, in addition, are worth more for shelling because\r\nof the high percentage of kernel compared to shell.\r\n\r\n_Grading._—Grading almonds for size is not done at present but probably\r\nwill be within the next few years. Grading for quality is done regularly\r\nby testing an entire lot rather than attempting to separate inferior\r\nnuts. The standard grade consists of all lots having the required\r\npercentage of good kernels, free from worms or gummy nuts. This\r\nrequirement varies between 90 and 95 per cent, depending on the condition\r\nof the crop as a whole and on the market conditions. The standard grade\r\nof a given variety sells on guarantee that it shall be up to advertised\r\nstandard. All lots which cannot pass this are sold on sample, and\r\ntherefore, on their own individual merits.\r\n\r\n\r\nMARKETING\r\n\r\nThe marketing of the California almond crop is at present on a firmer\r\nbasis than at any time in the past. Previous to 1910 there was little or\r\nno coöperation among growers and the buyers had everything their own way.\r\nIn May of that year, however, Mr. J. P. Dargitz, an almond grower near\r\nAcampo, California, successfully organized the California Almond Growers’\r\nExchange, consisting of nine local associations with a total membership\r\nof 230 growers. The Exchange started business with $1000 borrowed\r\ncapital, personally guaranteed by the directors. On June 1, 1918, there\r\nwere 22 sub-associations representing about 2000 growers, controlling\r\nabout three-fourths of the crop. The Exchange now is not only out of debt\r\nbut owns investments aggregating $100,000 in value, including warehouses,\r\na central shelling plant and other property. At the same time, the\r\ngrowers have been receiving about 50 per cent more for their almonds\r\nthan before the Exchange was organized.\r\n\r\nThe success of the Exchange, with the consequent higher prices to the\r\ngrower, has resulted in a large increase in the acreage of almonds in\r\nCalifornia. This increase is making it necessary to develop new markets\r\nto absorb the greater tonnage, and this can only be done effectively or\r\nsatisfactorily by coöperative effort.\r\n\r\nHeretofore, California almonds have been marketed chiefly in the shell.\r\nA small proportion has been cracked annually to supply western brokers\r\nand confectioners, and practically all of these have been sold west of\r\nthe Rocky Mountains. Only the whole nuts have been shipped to the eastern\r\nmarkets.\r\n\r\nThe European crops are sent to the United States largely as kernels and\r\nhave had a practical monopoly of the shelled almond business east of\r\nthe Rockies. The Tarragonas and Valencias shipped to America come into\r\ndirect competition with the I.X.L., Drake, Languedoc and other California\r\nalmonds, all of which are unshelled for the eastern markets. The imports\r\nof unshelled almonds average about the same as the California production.\r\nThe Jordan, Princess and other varieties, however, come in shelled,\r\nconstituting the bulk of the importations. The Jordan, because of its\r\nsuperior quality, is in a class by itself and does not compete at present\r\nwith the California product. The Princess and other almonds of that\r\ntype are much the same as the California shelling varieties and will be\r\nserious competitors when sold in the same markets.[4]\r\n\r\n_Storing._—Almonds awaiting removal or sale will become rancid if stored\r\nin warm or damp places. If the almonds have been properly cared for\r\nduring the handling process to prevent worm infection, and if the nuts\r\nhave been thoroughly cured, they will keep satisfactorily for a year or\r\nmore. The ideal condition is to keep them stored in a uniformly cool, dry\r\nstorage place with ample ventilation.\r\n\r\n\r\nYIELDS\r\n\r\nThe yield of almonds in different years and in different orchards is\r\nprobably more variable than that of any other of the common orchard\r\nfruits. The fluctuations from year to year are largely due to climatic\r\nconditions, while the variations in different orchards are largely due\r\nto variety, care given the trees throughout their life, the character of\r\nthe soil, and location with relation to local frost conditions.\r\n\r\nAlmonds first commence bearing at from two to four years of age; the\r\nfirst crop ranging from one or two nuts up to a hatful or possibly\r\nmore. The trees will first commence to bear a crop which it will pay\r\nto harvest, at from three to five years of age. Ordinarily, it will be\r\nnearer the latter, depending upon the type of soil in which the trees are\r\ngrowing and the moisture conditions surrounding them. On the hill lands\r\nthe trees begin to mature much earlier than in the rich bottom lands and\r\nconsequently come into bearing earlier. It must be borne in mind that a\r\ncrop which it will pay to harvest does not necessarily pay for the cost\r\nof orchard maintenance. A crop is not considered a paying crop until it\r\npays for the cost of maintenance as well as harvesting and handling.\r\nAlmond orchards, as a rule, reach this point at from five to seven\r\nyears of age. From this time on the trees should continue to increase\r\nin production from year to year, allowing for failures due to frost and\r\nother unfavorable conditions, until they are from 12 to 20 years old.\r\nUnder the common methods of care that most orchards receive, the trees\r\ncommence to decrease in their production at from 25 to 30 years, although\r\nin some cases it will be even sooner than that. On the other hand, well\r\ncared-for orchards will continue their maximum production even longer.\r\nThe age at which an orchard will no longer pay will range from 30 years\r\nupward. The top limit is still unknown.\r\n\r\nInvestigations carried on during 1913-1914[5] brought out the following\r\nfacts: The average production of almonds in California is between 700\r\nand 800 pounds per acre; if care is exercised in the selection of a\r\nproper location for an orchard and if good judgment is used in managing\r\nit, 1000 pounds per acre would be a safe estimate for business purposes;\r\nin many years competent men might be expected to obtain 1500 pounds per\r\nacre, but this could not be expected to hold for a ten-year average. The\r\npossibilities are shown by the crop from one acre on the University Farm,\r\nat Davis, California, of ten-year-old trees which amounted to nearly 2800\r\npounds in 1917.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOST OF PRODUCTION\r\n\r\nThe cost of producing almonds involves a number of variable factors,\r\nincluding overhead charges, such as the cost of the land, equipment,\r\ntaxes, insurance and depreciation; and also the cost of maintenance\r\nand handling. Maintenance includes such costs as pruning, plowing,\r\ncultivating, spraying and irrigation. Handling includes harvesting,\r\nhulling, hauling, and warehousing. Tabulations of estimates in tables II\r\nto VIII are based on information collected during the years 1913 to 1916,\r\ninclusive, from a large number of growers in practically all the almond\r\ndistricts of the state, and represent as accurately as possible with the\r\ndata at hand the average costs which actually exist throughout California.\r\n\r\n_Cost of the Land._—The estimates given in table II are to be taken as\r\nonly partially indicative of conditions which actually exist in the\r\nvarious districts mentioned. These figures do not give the entire range\r\nof prices but indicate some of the more common values placed upon the\r\nland.\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLE II\r\n\r\nVALUE OF ALMOND LAND IN CALIFORNIA\r\n\r\n                                                          Land in bearing\r\n                   District—               Bare land          orchard\r\n\r\n    Best Sacramento Valley land             $200-$400        $400-$600\r\n    Other good interior valley lands         150- 300         400- 500\r\n    Sacramento Valley, foothill sections      75- 150         200- 400\r\n    Contra Costa County                      100- 300         250- 500\r\n    Santa Clara and San Benito counties      300- 600         500- 800\r\n    Paso Robles district                      50- 150         ........\r\n    Banning district                         400- 800         600-1000\r\n                                            ---------         --------\r\n       Averages for California                 $250             $500\r\n\r\n_Equipment._—It has been found impossible to gather accurate figures upon\r\ncost of equipment in almond orchards, and especially so in view of the\r\npresent abnormal economic conditions, but the list given in table III\r\nwill give an idea of the equipment required. In addition, there will be\r\nother small items the grower will need which are not mentioned here.\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLE III\r\n\r\nALMOND ORCHARD EQUIPMENT\r\n\r\n    Plows\r\n    Harrows (spike-tooth and spring-tooth)\r\n    Disc Cultivator\r\n    Weed cutter\r\n    Clod masher\r\n    Roller\r\n    Hoes, shovels, etc.\r\n    Pruning tools\r\n    Brush burner\r\n    Spray outfit\r\n    Wagon\r\n    Barns, sheds and other buildings\r\n    Harvesting equipment:\r\n      Almond sheets\r\n      Poles\r\n      Lug boxes\r\n      Hulling machine\r\n      Sorting tables and bins\r\n      Drying trays\r\n    Sacks for transportation to warehouse\r\n    Orchard heating equipment ($25-$30 per acre)\r\n    Horses or tractors\r\n    Harness\r\n\r\n_Average Overhead Charges._—Table IV shows the average overhead charges\r\nfor almond orchards.

This disease is one\r\nof the most serious with which the grower has to contend. It is found\r\npractically everywhere almonds are grown and either greatly reduces the\r\nvitality of or kills the trees affected, depending upon the seriousness\r\nof the attack.\r\n\r\nThe disease is caused by a bacterial organism, _Bacterium tumefaciens_,\r\nthat seems to be native to most California soils. It is characterized by\r\nlarge swellings on the root crown or main roots just below the surface of\r\nthe ground, though lesser infections may sometimes be found also on the\r\nsmaller roots. When cut open, these knots appear spongy as if the bark\r\nand wood were all mixed together in one mass. They are most serious when\r\nspread over a large surface, either partially or completely girdling the\r\nroot or crown of the tree.\r\n\r\nControl methods are of three kinds:\r\n\r\n(1) Plant nothing but clean, healthy nursery trees, free from all trace\r\nof galls. In planting these trees be careful to trim off all broken or\r\ninjured roots, leaving nothing but smooth clean cuts at the ends of the\r\nroots which will heal over readily with the minimum opportunity for\r\ninfection.\r\n\r\n(2) Galls on orchard trees may be cut out to clean, healthy wood with a\r\nsharp knife or gouge chisel. The wound should be thoroughly disinfected\r\nwith a strong copper-sulphate or corrosive-sublimate solution, and\r\npainted with a protective covering such as paint or melted asphaltum,\r\nor it may be covered directly with Bordeaux paste and then the earth\r\nreturned to its place over the roots.\r\n\r\n(3) A method used with apparent success is to bore a one-inch hole about\r\ntwo-third of the way through each gall, as soon as the trees have become\r\ndormant in the fall. Then fill each hole with a concentrated solution of\r\ncopper sulphate and plug the opening. By spring, when growth is ready\r\nto start, the gall may be knocked off with a hammer. In most cases the\r\ngall is so thoroughly permeated by the solution that the infection is\r\ncompletely killed and further gall growth ceases in that place, unless\r\nlater infection occurs.\r\n\r\nThe use of resistant stocks has been suggested as a means of avoiding\r\ninfection, but no such stock suitable for the almond has yet been proved\r\nto be sufficiently resistant under average conditions to be safely\r\nrecommended. The greatest hopes for future success in combating this\r\ndisease, however, lie along this line.\r\n\r\n_Oak Fungus._—This is one of the most difficult diseases to control\r\nbecause it works and spreads beneath the surface of the ground in the\r\nroots of trees. In some sections of the state it is very serious in many\r\norchards.\r\n\r\nThe disease is often known as root-rot, being caused by a fungus\r\n_Armillaria mellea_, commonly called “toadstool” fungus. It is known as\r\nOak fungus because the disease is most commonly found in spots where old\r\noak trees have stood. Where orchards have been planted on such land,\r\nspots appear in which the trees gradually die, the disease spreading from\r\ntree to tree, in ever-widening circles, involving ordinarily about one\r\nrow of trees each year. During the winter, clusters of toadstools may be\r\nseen at the base of the affected trees. The fungus lives over in the old\r\noak roots for many years and, as the orchard becomes well established,\r\nthe fungus spreads to the almond roots. If not checked the spot will\r\neventually involve the entire orchard and prevent further growth of\r\nalmonds on such land for many years.\r\n\r\nControl is very difficult but may be secured by digging a deep trench\r\naround the affected area and preventing the infection from passing beyond\r\nthrough the roots. The spread of the disease may sometimes be held in\r\ncheck by grubbing out a row or two of healthy trees outside the affected\r\narea and taking care that all of the large roots are removed to a depth\r\nof several feet. Carbon bisulphide has been suggested for killing the\r\nfungus, but the cost is prohibitive except in small spots just starting.\r\n\r\nThere are no resistant stocks known at present upon which the almond can\r\nbe worked. The fig, pear or black walnut might safely replace the almond\r\nin such spots.\r\n\r\n_Shot-hole Fungus._—There are three different fungi that produce the\r\nshot-hole effect on the leaves of the almond, thus giving rise to the\r\nname.\r\n\r\n(1) _Coryneum beyerinikii_, or peach blight, is the most common form. It\r\nis not as serious on the wood of the almond as it is on the peach, but\r\nin seasons of damp spring weather it does much damage to the blossoms,\r\nfruits and leaves. Affected blossoms are killed outright, the entire\r\nblossoms turning brown and dropping much as if killed by frost. The young\r\nfruit becomes spotted by the fungus and this causes malformation, gumming\r\nand shriveling of the nuts, varying considerably with the severity of\r\nthe attack. On the leaves many small dead spots appear, the dead tissue\r\nsoon falling out and giving the shot-hole effect. Where the twigs are\r\naffected, small dead spots appear during the winter, most often at the\r\nbuds. This causes the death of the buds and often the ends of the twigs.\r\nDuring the spring, after growth starts, considerable gumming occurs from\r\nthese spots.\r\n\r\nEffective control can only be secured by two sprays—Bordeaux mixture in\r\nthe fall, as soon as the tree becomes dormant, and either Bordeaux or\r\nlime-sulphur solution (winter strength) just before the buds open in the\r\nspring. Both fall and spring sprays must be thoroughly applied to be\r\neffective.\r\n\r\n(2) _Cercospora circumscissa_ is another fungus causing much the same\r\neffect as the Coryneum. It is difficult for an untrained person to\r\ndistinguish between them. The same sprays used for Coryneum are effective\r\nin controlling this, though if this form alone is present the Bordeaux\r\nmixture or lime-sulphur spray in the spring should be sufficient.\r\n\r\n(3) _Gloeosporium amygdalinum_, while apparently uncommon in this state,\r\nhas been found to exist in some places. Further work must be done on this\r\nto determine its behavior and the most satisfactory methods of control,\r\nbut it is believed that the control measures mentioned for the other\r\nforms of “shot-hole” will also be applicable to this.\r\n\r\n_Prune Rust_ (_Puccinia Pruni_).—This fungus is worst in the southern\r\ncoast sections where almonds are not extensively grown. It is not\r\nserious on thrifty trees well supplied with moisture. The disease is\r\ncharacterized by reddish pustules on the under-sides of the leaves,\r\nappearing generally about July or August and causing a premature\r\nyellowing and dropping of the leaves.\r\n\r\nOrdinarily the only treatment needed is to supply the necessary moisture\r\nin the soil to keep the trees healthy and vigorous.\r\n\r\n_Heart Rot._—This is one of the most insidious of tree diseases, for it\r\nworks inside beneath an apparently healthy exterior until the decay has\r\nprogressed so far that the tree commences to break down, and then it is\r\ntoo late for remedial measures. The almond is not as susceptible to this\r\nas most other kinds of orchard trees, but where large wounds have been\r\nexposed to the weather, infection may take place readily, and after it is\r\nonce well started it continues at a comparatively rapid rate. Decay is\r\ncaused in most cases by one or more of about a dozen different fungi, of\r\nwhich the oyster-shell fungus is by far the most common.\r\n\r\nControl consists in taking care to leave no open wounds exposed to the\r\nair to dry and crack, thus permitting the entrance of decay organisms.\r\nMuch of this can be avoided by care in pruning the young tree so that the\r\nremoval of the large limbs will not be necessary later on. Where such\r\nwounds must be made, measures should be taken to prevent infection. This\r\ncan best be done by making smooth, clean cuts close to the part from\r\nwhich the branch to be removed emanates, leaving no stub. Stubs dry out\r\nand crack more quickly and require very much longer to heal over, if this\r\nis possible at all. Further, all such wounds which will not heal over\r\nthe first season should be covered with some good disinfectant, such as\r\ncorrosive sublimate, one part to one thousand parts of water, and then\r\npainted over with some elastic coating, such as “Flotine” or asphaltum,\r\ngrade D, applied with a brush. The entire wound must be covered or the\r\nwork is largely wasted.\r\n\r\n_Die-back._—This is serious in many orchards where moisture is\r\ninsufficient to carry the trees through the growing season, and the\r\ntrees show considerable dying-back of the branches. Unfavorable soil\r\nconditions, such as hardpan, gravel or sand may be the direct cause of\r\nsuch moisture shortage. Lack of soil fertility is also a common cause.\r\nControl measures consist in remedying the defective conditions and where\r\nthis cannot be done economically it is better to abandon further attempts\r\nat almond culture on such land.\r\n\r\n_Sour-sap._—This is one of the so-called “physiological diseases” and is\r\nquite common with the almond. It is most frequently found where trees\r\nare planted in heavy or poorly drained soils. The inability of the\r\nalmond to endure standing water around its roots for any length of time\r\nand particularly so after growth commences in the spring, renders it\r\nespecially liable to sour-sap when planted in soils where excess water\r\nfrom the late winter and spring rains cannot be readily drained away. The\r\ndirect cause of the trouble is sudden changes in weather from warm to\r\ncold after growth commences, which checks the flow of sap very suddenly,\r\ncausing stagnation, cracking of the bark and then fermentation. With an\r\nunusually strong flow of sap in trees in wet soils, such climatic changes\r\ncause unusually severe disturbances in the normal functioning of the\r\ntrees.\r\n\r\nThe affected trees ordinarily show the disease first in the spring when\r\ngum may be seen oozing from the bark of the trunk or main branches, and\r\nsometimes even from the smaller branches. Small or large branches may\r\ndie, and in severe cases the tree may die soon after having commenced to\r\nleaf out strongly. On cutting through the bark to the wood and peeling\r\nback, a strong sour odor is noticeable. The cambium layer appears\r\nbrownish or reddish in color and often masses of gum may be found between\r\nthe bark and the wood. Mild cases may not be serious enough to show on\r\nthe outside of the tree and only portions of the cambium layer may die.\r\nThe sudden dropping of the blossoms or young fruit may in some instances\r\nbe attributable to sour-sap.\r\n\r\nAll affected parts on smaller branches should be cut back to healthy\r\nwood, while on the main branches or trunk, where only a small portion or\r\none side is affected, it is best to clean out the dead bark and paint the\r\nbared wood with a protective covering until new bark can cover the spot.\r\nAt the same time every effort should be made to remedy the soil-moisture\r\nconditions which were largely responsible for the trouble in the first\r\nplace.\r\n\r\n_Fruit-drop._—The same conditions which cause sour-sap may cause fruit\r\ndrop. It may be caused by lack of pollination due to improper mixing of\r\nvarieties or to rain during blossoming. Frost may also produce the same\r\nthing by killing the germ in the young fruit. In such cases, the fruit\r\nmay remain on the tree for one or two weeks after the injury occurs\r\nbefore falling, and in some cases, may even appear to continue its\r\ndevelopment for a short while.\r\n\r\n\r\nINSECT PESTS\r\n\r\n_Mites._—Commonly called red spiders. There are two kinds of mites that\r\ndo much damage in almond orchards, the brown or almond mite and the\r\nyellow or two-spotted mite. Both are common in all parts of the state and\r\nare the worst pests the almond grower must regularly face.\r\n\r\nThe brown mite (_Bryobia pratensis_) is the larger of the two, is dark\r\nred or brown in adult stage, has very long front legs, and a flattened\r\nback. It does not spin any web and works on the green bark of the small\r\ntwigs as well as on the leaves, sucking the plant juices from beneath\r\nthe bark. It causes a mottling of the leaves which eventually fall,\r\nalthough not as readily or in such large numbers as when attacked by the\r\nyellow mite. The injury to the tree is equally as great because of the\r\nserious drain on the vitality as a whole and because it commences work\r\nearlier in the season. This mite may spend its entire life on the tree;\r\nthe very small, round, red eggs being laid largely on the under-side of\r\nthe branches and in cracks and crevices in the bark and twigs. These\r\nremain on the tree throughout the winter and hatch early in the spring\r\nsoon after the trees have their leaves half developed, leaving the white\r\negg-shells in place. Most of their work is done in the spring and early\r\nsummer.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 22.—Nonpareil almonds. Branch on left free from Red\r\nSpider and holding its full supply of leaves in green, healthy condition;\r\nbranch on right defoliated by Yellow Mite. Note premature ripening of\r\nnuts on defoliated branch.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 23.—Forty-three-year-old Languedoc almonds on peach\r\nroot, near Davis. This orchard has not been thoroughly cultivated or\r\nirrigated. Mites have largely defoliated the trees. See contrast in Fig.\r\n24.]\r\n\r\nThe brown mite may be controlled satisfactorily by means of a dormant\r\nspray of lime-sulphur solution, 1 gallon to 10 gallons of water, applied\r\njust before the buds open in the spring. Crude oil emulsion as a dormant\r\nspray is also effective, if thoroughly applied over the entire tree under\r\nhigh pressure. This also applies to applications of the lime-sulphur\r\nspray.\r\n\r\nDuring the growing season a milder material must be used. Dry dust\r\nsulphur, using only the very finest grade of “flowers of sulphur,” is\r\noften very effective, provided weather conditions are satisfactory, but\r\ngenerally this must be applied a number of times if best results are to\r\nbe obtained. The work is done by blowing the sulphur dust into the tree\r\nwith blowers in the early morning when there is little or no wind.\r\n\r\nA more satisfactory method is the use of “Atomic sulphur” or other\r\nsulphur pastes or similar material. “Atomic sulphur” is a prepared spray\r\nwhose value consists in the fact that the sulphur is held in suspension\r\nin water so that it may be applied as a liquid spray. By this method the\r\nmaterial may be more effectively and thoroughly applied. “Atomic sulphur”\r\nis applied at the rate of 10 pounds to 100 gallons of water.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 24.—Forty-three-year-old Languedoc almonds on\r\npeach root, near Davis. This orchard has been irrigated and thoroughly\r\ncultivated, and mites have not defoliated the trees. Note contrast in\r\nFig. 23.]\r\n\r\nThe use of lime-sulphur, the commercial strength of 33 to 34 degrees\r\nBeaumé being diluted 1 part to 35 parts water, is another effective\r\nmethod. For such use a flour paste may be added at the rate of 4 gallons\r\nto each 100 gallons of the spray mixture to act as a spreader. This paste\r\nis made by cooking one pound of flour with enough water to make one\r\ngallon of the mixture.\r\n\r\nThe yellow mite (_Tetranychus telarius_) is much smaller than the brown\r\nmite and is of a pale yellow color with occasionally a reddish tinge and\r\nsometimes with two darker spots on either side of the body. Unlike the\r\nbrown mite, the winter is spent in concealment somewhere, presumably\r\noff the tree. During the warm days of early summer, generally in June,\r\nthe mite makes its appearance on the trees, spinning a fine web on the\r\nleaves, generally on the upper surface, and then works under this web.\r\nThe mite sucks the plant juices from the leaves giving them a yellowish\r\nmottled appearance. These leaves soon die and drop to the ground. In\r\nserious infestations the trees are often almost completely defoliated by\r\nthe end of August. (See figure 22.)\r\n\r\nThe use of dormant sprays is not effective for controlling the yellow\r\nmite, but the summer sprays mentioned above are all satisfactory, and for\r\nbest results, must be applied under high pressure, preferably 200 pounds\r\nor more.\r\n\r\nThe mites are much easier controlled where a comparatively high\r\npercentage of moisture is kept in the soil by frequent cultivations, or,\r\nif necessary, by irrigation (figures 23 and 24).\r\n\r\n_Peach Twig Borer_ (_Anarsia lineatella_).—In the larval stage these\r\nborers work on the young buds and shoots in the early spring. They\r\nare especially troublesome in newly planted orchard trees when a\r\ncomparatively small number may kill most of the new shoots which are\r\nneeded to make the desired framework of the tree. In some years they may\r\nbe serious in large trees also. Dormant spray of lime-sulphur applied\r\nunder high pressure just as the buds are opening in the spring will\r\ncontrol the borers very effectively. This same spray may be used to\r\ncontrol the brown mite, thereby accomplishing double control.\r\n\r\n_California Peach Borer_ (_Ægeria opalescens_).—The larvae are serious in\r\nmany parts of the state where they burrow just under the bark near the\r\nsurface of the ground. They may be detected by the small bits of frass\r\nand gum at the entrance of their burrows. If allowed to continue, they\r\nwill eventually girdle the tree.\r\n\r\nThe surest means of control is to dig out the worms with a knife or kill\r\nthem with a wire probe. This work should be done systematically once\r\nor twice every year and very thoroughly if it is to be effective. The\r\napplication of hot “Flotine” or asphaltum, grade D, after the worms are\r\nkilled should help considerably to prevent the entrance of the larvae. To\r\nbe effective it must be applied at least twice a year on young trees and\r\nprobably the same on old trees.\r\n\r\n_Thrips._—These are most serious on the almond leaves, their attacks\r\nbeing serious enough to cause considerable defoliation in late spring or\r\nearly summer. They may be controlled by spraying with lime-sulphur, 1\r\nto 30, to which has been added black-leaf 40 (40 per cent nicotine) at\r\nthe rate of 1 part to 1500 parts of water or other spray-mixture. It is\r\npossible that other than the pear thrips have been doing damage, but the\r\nsame spray as described above should be effective against all.\r\n\r\n_Grasshopper._—Grasshoppers have been serious in orchards in outlying\r\nfoothill districts in some years, and especially so in young orchards\r\nwhere it has been almost impossible to get trees started properly. In\r\nsuch locations special means must be employed on a large scale to protect\r\norchards from their devastations, of which poisoned bait and hopper\r\ndozers are the most effective.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 25.—Almonds infested with larvae of Indian Meal Moth\r\n(_Plodia interpunctella_).]\r\n\r\nIndian Meal Moth (_Plodia interpunctella_).—The larva of this moth feeds\r\non the kernels of the harvested almonds when they are stored. Infestation\r\nusually takes place in storerooms or warehouses in which the nuts have\r\nbeen placed for a time. The warehouses become infested from old grain\r\nbags which have been kept there at one time or another. So far as known,\r\ninfestation does not take place in the field. The larvae will continue to\r\nwork in the stored almonds for a long time, doing a very great amount of\r\ndamage (fig. 25). They may be controlled by thoroughly cleaning out the\r\ncorners of the warehouse and thoroughly disinfecting. The nuts should be\r\ndisinfected with carbon bisulphide (explosive when in the form of a gas\r\nmixed with air), or other means used to control insects in grain.[6]\r\nPrevention is far easier than the cure in this case.\r\n\r\nScale, aphis, diabrotica and other insects are sometimes found on the\r\ntrees, but are generally not sufficiently troublesome to require special\r\nattention. Most of them are held in check by the control measures used\r\nfor the more serious pests.\r\n\r\n\r\nOTHER PESTS\r\n\r\n_Gophers._—These often do great damage to the trees by girdling them\r\njust below the surface of the ground, or if they do not actually girdle\r\nthe trees, they cut them enough to devitalize them and, in addition, the\r\nwounds made by their gnawings frequently become infected with crown-gall\r\norganisms. The only safe means of control is the constant use of traps\r\nsupplemented by poisoned bait.\r\n\r\n_Squirrels._—Squirrels are very troublesome, as they harvest a large\r\namount of almonds before they are sufficiently ripe to be harvested by\r\nthe grower. The use of poisoned grain or “gas,” if used over a large area\r\nof surrounding territory, will prevent serious depredations.\r\n\r\n_Birds._—Birds also carry off large amounts of almonds if the orchards\r\nare near open country or hills, especially if wooded. Crows, bluejays,\r\nblackbirds, yellow-hammers, robins and other similar birds are the worst\r\noffenders. Sometimes linnets eat off large numbers of fruit buds in the\r\nspring in a few of the newer sections where plantings are scattered.\r\nSap-suckers have been known to girdle entire trees or large branches by\r\ncutting large numbers of holes in a series of lines close together around\r\nthe trunk or limbs.\r\n\r\n_Morning-glory._—This is probably the worst of the weeds in almond\r\norchards, and is the hardest to control. Sheep and chickens may be used\r\nwith excellent results, provided care is taken to see that the sheep are\r\nnot allowed to go hungry, for then they will bark the trunks of the trees\r\nvery quickly. An excellent plan is to arrange gates so that the sheep\r\nmust go through the orchard from pasture to get water. In passing back\r\nand forth they will forage over the entire orchard and dig up all the\r\nmorning-glory in sight. Chickens are fond of the succulent new shoots,\r\nand will keep them below the ground until the underground stems and roots\r\nweaken and die. Cultivation throughout the growing season, often enough\r\nto prevent the morning-glory from developing any leaves for a whole year\r\nat least, and longer if necessary, will starve the plants to death.\r\n\r\n\r\nVARIETIES\r\n\r\nThe problem of selecting varieties of almonds for planting in California\r\nis to choose the ones that are most marketable and at the same time to\r\nsecure best results in cross-pollination. At the present time there are\r\ncomparatively few varieties of almonds which have won and retained their\r\npopularity with the grower and the trade. There are a number of reasons\r\nfor this condition. The cultural, climatic and soil conditions under\r\nwhich the almond thrives are much more limited than for most of the\r\ncommon deciduous fruits; the area of production in America is limited\r\nlargely to California; the industry is comparatively new, and in general,\r\nthere is not the great varietal variation in season, appearance, texture,\r\nflavor and behavior that is found in the apple, peach, pear and similar\r\nfruits. The comparatively rapid deterioration of fleshy fruits after\r\nripening makes a succession of varieties desirable to extend the period\r\nof consumption. With almonds, the season of all varieties extends from\r\none harvest to the next, if properly handled. Growers are, therefore,\r\nrecommended to plant only standard, marketable varieties as far as\r\npossible.\r\n\r\nEarly ripening varieties must be chosen. The crop must be in the hands of\r\nthe trade early, for the bulk of it is used in the holiday trade. This\r\nis especially true with unshelled almonds. Early almonds only can be\r\nharvested and sold before the bulk of the European shipments arrive.\r\n\r\nThe actual time of ripening of the different varieties is variable from\r\nseason to season, and in different sections or even different orchards\r\nin the same season. Generally, harvesting commences early in August and\r\ncloses about the middle of October. The approximate order of ripening of\r\nthe better known varieties is shown in table IX.\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLE IX\r\n\r\nAPPROXIMATE ORDER OF RIPENING OF VARIETIES OF ALMONDS\r\n\r\n    1. Nonpareil\r\n    2. I.X.L.\r\n       Jordan\r\n    3. Ne Plus Ultra\r\n    4. Peerless\r\n       Princess\r\n       California\r\n       King\r\n       Silver\r\n    5. Golden State\r\n    6. Lewelling\r\n    7. Drake\r\n    8. Languedoc\r\n       Texas\r\n\r\nMany new varieties have been originated in California but most of them\r\nhave fallen into disfavor in a short time. In fact, it is impossible to\r\nlocate even single trees of some varieties which were formerly well\r\nknown. From time to time, however, worthy varieties have been introduced\r\nand have succeeded in making a permanent place for themselves through\r\ntheir ability to fill a demand that before had been but partially or\r\npoorly supplied.\r\n\r\nIn view of the changing market situation for California almonds, due to\r\nthe rapidly increasing acreage and the very limited demand for unshelled\r\nalmonds, it is safe to predict that the only new varieties which will\r\nbe of value in the future will be those that are primarily of superior\r\nquality for shelling purposes. Yield must take second place.\r\n\r\nWell known varieties are not only in heavier demand in the principal\r\nmarkets, but they invariably bring much better prices than the newer\r\nvarieties. In some years, when the domestic crop of a given variety is\r\nlight and the demand good, it is possible to unload poorer or less known\r\nvarieties at fairly good prices. More often, however, they are a drag on\r\nthe market.\r\n\r\nOwing to the increasing consumption of shelled almonds and the\r\nprobability of a still greater increase in the future, growers should\r\narrange future plantings with a view to supplying the best shelling\r\nvarieties. At the present time, the best shelling varieties are not\r\nordinarily the heaviest producers. With a limited production they may not\r\neven bring as large returns as the poorer but heavier yielding varieties.\r\nAs the production increases, which it is doing very rapidly, the relative\r\nvalue of the best shelling varieties will increase in proportion and they\r\nmay be sold at good prices when it will be impossible to move a heavy\r\ntonnage of a poor variety at a profitable price.\r\n\r\nAlthough the future almond markets will no doubt use shelled almonds very\r\nlargely, there will always be a limited demand for unshelled almonds\r\nfor use in the holiday trade and for home table use. Unshelled almonds\r\nto be acceptable for such purposes must be large, attractive nuts with\r\nlight-colored, clean-looking shells, soft enough to be broken with the\r\nhands. The kernels must be well filled and free from gum. The I.X.L. is\r\nthe most popular and highest-priced nut for this purpose. The Ne Plus\r\nUltra ranks next because of its attractive outside appearance and shape;\r\none of the principal objections to it being its tendency to have gummy\r\nkernels. The Drake is another variety in demand for this purpose. It\r\nis moderately large, plump and well filled with a good quality kernel,\r\nand while not as attractive as the I.X.L. or Ne Plus Ultra, it is\r\npopular with the medium-priced trade. A certain class of trade prefers\r\nthe Nonpareil for such use, and it appears to be growing in popularity\r\nbecause of the attractive kernel and the ease with which shelling by hand\r\nis accomplished.\r\n\r\nThe confectioners, on the other hand, care nothing for shell. They want\r\na medium or large sized kernel, uniform in shape, and plump; one that\r\ncan be coated smoothly or evenly with candy. For blanching and salting\r\npurposes, the kernels must be large and smooth. The best California\r\nvariety for this purpose is the Nonpareil. It is also the best nut for\r\ntable use when sold shelled. As a rule, the papershell varieties are the\r\nbest for shelling because of the large percentage of unbroken kernels\r\nwhich may be obtained. The broken kernels and those obtained from\r\ncheaper and less desirable varieties are used largely by the bakers and\r\nalmond-paste manufacturers.\r\n\r\nThe planting of large blocks of orchards to single varieties is not a\r\nwise practice. Planting of several varieties will assist greatly in\r\nlengthening the harvest season, and thus enable one to handle large\r\ncrops with fewer men and less equipment. For example, the four best\r\nvarieties—the Nonpareil, I.X.L., Ne Plus Ultra and Drake—ripen in the\r\norder named; the Nonpareil ripening about two weeks before the I.X.L.,\r\nthe Ne Plus Ultra about a week after the I.X.L., and the Drake about\r\ntwo weeks after the Ne Plus Ultra. Where there is danger of failure\r\nof varieties to set fruit due to frost or improper pollination or\r\nunfavorable weather conditions during, or soon after, blooming, the\r\ngrower is more likely to get a crop from some variety if several are\r\nplanted to secure a succession of bloom in the spring.\r\n\r\nThe principal reason for interplanting varieties is to secure adequate\r\ncross-pollination. For this purpose the Ne Plus Ultra and Drake are\r\nprobably the best to use as pollenizers.\r\n\r\nOther combinations, as indicated on page 6, may be made that will be\r\nsatisfactory, though care must be exercised to secure varieties that\r\nblossom near enough together to be effective. Figure 26 shows the\r\neffective blossoming period for fifteen varieties.\r\n\r\n_Adaptation of Varieties._—The best marketable nuts are, as has been\r\nsuggested, few in number, and most of these do well in all of the\r\nprincipal almond districts of California. Where the climatic and soil\r\ncondition are equally favorable there is no great variation in their\r\nbehavior, but owing to such differences it has been found that certain\r\nvarieties are better adapted to some districts than others.\r\n\r\nThe Nonpareil, the best variety known at the present time for California\r\nconditions, bears more nearly uniform crops from year to year and shows\r\na wider range of adaptation than any of the other good commercial\r\nvarieties. It has proved itself to be satisfactory in every almond\r\ndistrict in the state. The Drake closely approaches the Nonpareil in this\r\nrespect. The I.X.L. and Ne Plus Ultra are the most variable in their\r\nbehavior. The blossoms of the two varieties seem to be more tender and\r\nhence more liable to injury under unfavorable conditions; gumming is more\r\nprevalent near the coast, and during harvest the slower ripening and\r\nopening of the hulls in the more moist atmosphere in many of the coast\r\nvalleys causes excessive darkening and sometimes molding of the shell.\r\nThe Ne Plus Ultra does its best on comparatively high, well-drained\r\nsoils, adjacent to the larger streams in the Sacramento Valley, such as\r\nthe lands along the Sacramento River, Putah Creek, Cache Creek, etc.,\r\nthough it also grows and produces well in the Banning district and in\r\nmany of the foothill sections where conditions are favorable. The I.X.L.\r\ndoes best on the foothills surrounding the Sacramento Valley, notable\r\non the west side. In the Banning district the Ne Plus Ultra seems to be\r\na better producer than the I.X.L. Varieties which ripen later than the\r\nDrake should be avoided in the Banning district because of the liability\r\nto damage from the frequent October rains.\r\n\r\nThere are a number of different varieties, such as the Eureka and Jordan,\r\nwhich give promise of filling a limited place in the markets but which\r\nhave not yet been thoroughly tested throughout the state. The Eureka\r\nis popular with confectioners because of the similarity in shape to\r\nthe Jordan. In limited quantities the demand is good. It is still a\r\nquestion as to whether it would hold up in price if grown in very large\r\nquantities. The Jordan nut is of excellent quality but in California\r\nthe trees are variable in vigor. In some cases the trees make unusually\r\nlarge, vigorous growth while in others they are small and apparently\r\nstunted. The cause of this has never been adequately determined. In\r\ngeneral, the Jordans do not bear sufficiently heavy crops to make them\r\npay at the prevailing low prices. The chief reasons for the low prices\r\nare the extreme hardness of the shell and the absence of satisfactory\r\nmethods of shelling. The invention of a satisfactory machine for this\r\npurpose would probably make it pay to plant Jordans in much larger\r\nquantities.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 26.—Period of Effective Blossoming of\r\nAlmonds—University Farm—1917.]\r\n\r\nOther varieties, such as the Texas, have been sufficiently tested to\r\nshow them to be well adapted to most districts, but they are not to be\r\nrecommended because of the difficulty experienced in marketing them at\r\na profit in large quantities. The Texas has been planted extensively\r\nin California without sufficient justification. It was planted because\r\nof its value as a pollenizer, its precocious and prolific bearing, and\r\nits upright habit of growth. In small quantities it was sold in less\r\nexacting markets as a Drake, but in larger quantities there has been a\r\ngood deal of objection to it on the part of the trade. As the bearing\r\ntrees become older and bear heavier crops, the nuts tend to become\r\nsmaller and the shells harder, which increases the difficulty of selling.\r\nFrom the standpoint of the grower as well as the market, the lateness in\r\nripening is very objectionable. The California Almond Growers’ Exchange\r\nis finding it harder each year to satisfactorily market the rapidly\r\nincreasing tonnage of this variety. It should, therefore, be avoided in\r\nnew plantings.\r\n\r\n\r\nSIZE OF ALMONDS\r\n\r\nRecords of fourteen varieties of almonds grown in the same orchard under\r\nsimilar conditions of soil and culture have been kept at the University\r\nFarm at Davis, for the years 1913 to 1916, inclusive. These trees are all\r\nof the same age, except the Texas, Peerless and Harriott, which are one\r\nyear younger than the others. These figures show that there is a wide\r\nvariation within varieties from year to year, not only as regards size,\r\nbut proportion of shell to whole nut, and in the proportion of double\r\nkernels.\r\n\r\nTable X shows the variation in size from year to year, as indicated by\r\nthe number of nuts per pound. Five-pound samples of each variety were\r\nused to determine the average size:\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLE X\r\n\r\nNUMBER OF ALMONDS PER POUND FOR YEARS 1913 TO 1916, INCLUSIVE\r\n\r\n    Variety          1913    1914    1915    1916   Average\r\n\r\n    Nonpareil         256     240     224     223     236\r\n    I.X.L.            149     149     159     150     152\r\n    Ne Plus Ultra       —     163     179     169     167\r\n    Drake             189     132     131     130     145.5\r\n    Languedoc         226     220     185     213     211\r\n    Texas             182     171     165     173     173\r\n    Reams             138     123     143     148     140.5\r\n    Lewelling         154     150     158     139     150\r\n    Peerless            —     118     127     134     124\r\n    Princess          270     241     190     252     238\r\n    California          —     232     211     206     216\r\n    King                —     246     234     244     241\r\n    Harriott            —     175     151     176     167\r\n    Jordan              —      76      70      75      74\r\n\r\nThe value of an almond for shelling depends not alone on its relative\r\nease of cracking, but also upon the percentage of kernel to the whole nut\r\nas shown in table XI:\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLE XI\r\n\r\nPERCENTAGE OF KERNELS TO WHOLE NUTS\r\n\r\n                   1913       1914       1915       1916    Average\r\n    Variety      Per cent   Per cent   Per cent   Per cent  Per cent\r\n\r\n    Nonpareil     67.5        65.0       67.2       67.0      66.6\r\n    I.X.L.        45.31       48.5       60.6       54.7      52.28\r\n    Ne Plus Ultra   —         53.25      57.6       58.5      56.45\r\n    Drake         46.33       42.40      47.0       42.2      44.48\r\n    Languedoc     48.75       50.0       49.4       48.5      49.16\r\n    Texas         43.75       45.0       42.4       44.4      43.89\r\n    Reams         45.94       42.5       49.25      43.4      45.27\r\n    Lewelling     43.44       48.8       50.6       45.0      46.96\r\n    Peerless        —         36.0       39.65      32.5      36.05\r\n    Princess      65.0        73.0       70.6       73.8      70.6\r\n    California      —         71.2       70.6       69.5      70.43\r\n    King            —         70.0       72.0       71.6      71.2\r\n    Harriott        —         56.25      54.2       50.6      53.68\r\n    Jordan          —         25.0       23.8       26.9      25.23\r\n\r\nDouble kernels are particularly undesirable in nuts for shelling because\r\nof the irregular shape of the halves, which renders them unfit for\r\nconfectionery or bakery purposes where whole kernels are used.

TEXAS. DRAKE.\r\n\r\nNONPAREIL. I.X.L. NE PLUS ULTRA.\r\n\r\nTARRAGONA. JORDAN. PEERLESS.]\r\n\r\n_Standardshell._—Those requiring very strong pressure of the hand or the\r\nuse of a nut-cracker to break. These may have a spongy or smooth outer\r\nshell.\r\n\r\n_Hardshell._—Those which cannot be broken by hand but require a sharp\r\nblow with a hammer or strong pressure with a nut cracker to crack them.\r\n\r\nThe papershell varieties are excellent for shelling as they contain a\r\nlarge percentage of kernels which may easily be obtained whole. The\r\nprincipal objections are that birds are particularly fond of them since\r\nthey can crack them easily, and the shells are often poorly sealed. The\r\nlatter fact makes it difficult to prevent worm infestation and to prevent\r\nthe penetration of sulphur fumes to the kernel during the bleaching\r\nprocess. As a result practically none of the papershells are bleached but\r\nare sold for shelling purposes.\r\n\r\nThe softshells are generally more attractive for table use because the\r\nshells are more perfect and, in commercial varieties, are brighter in\r\ncolor and more attractive. The shells are usually well sealed and can\r\nbe bleached to give additional brightness with less danger of the fumes\r\npenetrating to the kernel than the papershells.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 28.—Almond varieties.\r\n\r\nHARRIOTT. EUREKA. LEWELLING.\r\n\r\nKING. CALIFORNIA. PRINCESS.\r\n\r\nSTUART. LA PRIMA. BATHAM.]\r\n\r\nThe standardshells have the greatest range in character, thickness\r\nand hardness of shell. For table use they are sometimes too hard for\r\nhigh-class trade. The percentage of kernel is too low to make them very\r\nattractive to the retail trade. Of this class of almond the Drake is\r\nprobably the best of the California varieties. Almond varieties of all\r\nthese classes are shown in figures 27 and 28. These illustrations show\r\nmost of the varieties grown to any extent in California and others that\r\nhave attracted much interest and inquiry, together with the European\r\nTarragona.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Tufts, W.
