WERTHEIMER AND CO.,\r\nCIRCUS PLACE, FINSBURY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn making a selection of anecdotes, those have been assembled which were\r\nsupplied by me to other works, and in most instances have received\r\nconsiderable amplification; others have been given which never before\r\nwere printed--perhaps not even written; while all which have been\r\ntransferred from other pages to mine have received the stamp of\r\nauthenticity. Besides those whose names are already mentioned, I have to\r\nthank several friends who have drawn from their private stores for my\r\nadvantage, and thus enabled me to offer much that is perfectly new.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDry details of science and classification have been laid aside, but a\r\ncertain order has been kept to avoid confusion; and, although endeavours\r\nhave been made to throw as much interest as possible over these\r\nrecorded habits and actions of the brute creation; I love the latter too\r\nwell to raise a doubt by one word of embellishment, even if I did not\r\nabstain from principle.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe intentions with which this work was commenced have not been carried\r\nout, inasmuch as materials have crowded upon me beyond all calculation;\r\nand, although a large portion has been rejected, the anecdotes related\r\ngo no farther than the Mammalia, while almost all animals were to have\r\nbeen included.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWith regard to the remaining orders--if the present work should meet\r\nwith a favourable reception, I shall hope next year to present the\r\npublic with touching and amusing proofs of the sagacity and dispositions\r\nof birds, and of \"hair-breadth scapes\" from reptiles, etc., some of\r\nwhich will, like those in the present volume, be carefully selected from\r\nthe works of travellers, from the resources of friends, and from my own\r\nexperience.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTo the pleasing task of enlightening those, who, shut up in close\r\ncities, have no opportunity of observing for themselves, and to the\r\nstill higher enjoyment of directing young minds to an elevating pursuit,\r\nthe naturalist adds a gratification even better than all, by making\r\nknown the hidden wonders of nature; and leaving to those who delight in\r\nargument, the ever unsolved question of where instinct ends and reason\r\nbegins, he sets forth the love of the great Creator towards all His\r\ncreatures, and the ways He takes to show His wisdom.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS.\r\n\r\n                                                        PAGE\r\n\r\nMONKEYS, ETC.                                              1\r\n\r\nBATS                                                      33\r\n\r\nMOLES                                                     41\r\n\r\nHEDGEHOGS                                                 47\r\n\r\nBEARS                                                     51\r\n\r\nBADGERS                                                   66\r\n\r\nWEASELS                                                   73\r\n\r\nOTTERS                                                    78\r\n\r\nDOGS                                                      83\r\n\r\nWOLVES                                                   162\r\n\r\nFOXES                                                    174\r\n\r\nHYAENAS                                                   180\r\n\r\nLIONS                                                    186\r\n\r\nTIGERS                                                   213\r\n\r\nLEOPARDS, PANTHERS, ETC.                                 224\r\n\r\nCATS                                                     237\r\n\r\nSQUIRRELS                                                250\r\n\r\nRATS                                                     254\r\n\r\nMICE                                                     266\r\n\r\nELEPHANTS                                                271\r\n\r\nHIPPOPOTAMUS                                             294\r\n\r\nHOGS                                                     297\r\n\r\nRHINOCEROSES                                             307\r\n\r\nHORSES                                                   312\r\n\r\nTHE ASS                                                  333\r\n\r\nCAMELS.--DROMEDARIES                                     339\r\n\r\nLLAMAS, ETC.                                             344\r\n\r\nDEER                                                     347\r\n\r\nGIRAFFES                                                 354\r\n\r\nANTELOPES                                                358\r\n\r\nGOATS                                                    363\r\n\r\nSHEEP                                                    368\r\n\r\nOXEN                                                     373\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nANECDOTES OF ANIMALS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE QUADRUMANA, OR MONKEY TRIBE.\r\n\r\n\r\nFormed like man, and practicing similar gestures, but with thumbs\r\ninstead of great toes upon their feet, and with so narrow a heel-bone,\r\nthat even those who constantly walk upright have not the firm and\r\ndignified step of human beings; the Quadrumana yet approximate so\r\nclosely to us, that they demand the first place in a book devoted\r\nprincipally to the intellectual (whether it be reason or instinct)\r\nhistory of animals. This approximation is a matter of amusement to some;\r\nbut to the larger portion of mankind, I should say, it is a source of\r\ndisgust. \"Rapoynda,\" I exclaimed, one day, to a troublesome,\r\ninquisitive, restless negro, pointing to a black monkey, which much\r\nresembled him in character, \"that is your brother.\" Never shall I forget\r\nthe malignant scowl which passed over the man's features at my heedless\r\ncomparison. No apology, no kindness, not even the gift of a smart\r\nwaistcoat, which he greatly coveted, ever restored me to his good\r\ngraces; and I was not sorry when his Chief summoned him from my\r\nvicinity, for I dreaded his revenge.\r\n\r\nA few years after, I stood lost in admiration before Sir Edwin\r\nLandseer's inimitable picture of \"the monkey who had seen the world,\" in\r\nwhich nature and truth lend their tone and force to the highest efforts\r\nof art; when a voice exclaimed, \"How can you waste your time looking at\r\nthat thing; such creatures ought never to have been painted;\" and\r\nalthough the speaker was a religious man, he muttered to himself, \"I am\r\nnot sure they ought ever to have been made.\" The voice proceeded from\r\none of the finest instances of manly beauty; one famed also for talent\r\nand acquirement. Rapoynda started into my recollection; and as I slowly\r\nleft the talented picture, I could not help smiling at the common\r\nfeeling between the savage and the gentleman, thereby proving its\r\nuniversality.\r\n\r\nNever did any one start for a tropical climate with a greater antipathy\r\ntowards these \"wild men\" than I did; I lived years in their vicinity and\r\nyet contrived to avoid all contact with them, and it was not till I was\r\nhomeward-bound that my conversion was effected. The ship in which Mr.\r\nBowdich and myself took a round-about course to England, was floating\r\non a wide expanse of water, disturbed only by the heavy swell, which\r\nforms the sole motion in a calm; the watch on deck were seated near the\r\nbows of the vessel, the passengers and officers were almost all below,\r\nthere was only myself and the helmsman on the after-deck; he stood\r\nlistlessly by the binnacle, and I was wholly occupied in reading. A\r\nnoise between a squeak and a chatter suddenly met my ears; and before I\r\ncould turn my head to see whence it proceeded, a heavy, living creature\r\njumped on to my shoulders from behind, and its tail encircled my throat.\r\nI felt it was Jack, the cook's monkey; the mischievous, malicious,\r\nmocking, but inimitable Jack, whose pranks had often made me laugh\r\nagainst my will, as I watched him from a distance, but with whom I had\r\nnever made the least acquaintance. Whether from fear or presence of mind\r\nI do not pretend to say, but I remained perfectly still, and in a minute\r\nor two Jack put his head forward and stared me in the face, uttering a\r\nsort of croak; he then descended on to my knees, examined my hands as if\r\nhe were counting my fingers, tried to take off my rings, and when I gave\r\nhim some biscuit, curled himself compactly into my lap. We were friends\r\nfrom that moment. My aversion thus cured, I have ever since felt\r\nindescribable interest and entertainment in watching, studying, and\r\nprotecting monkeys. We had several on board the above-mentioned vessel,\r\nbut Jack was the prince of them all.\r\n\r\nExclusively belonging to the cook, although a favourite with the whole\r\ncrew, my friend (a Cercopithecus from Senegal) had been at first kept by\r\nmeans of a cord, attached to the caboose; but, as he became more and\r\nmore tame, his liberty was extended, till at last he was allowed the\r\nwhole range of the ship, with the exception of the captain's and\r\npassengers' cabins. The occupations which he marked out for himself\r\nbegan at early dawn, by overturning the steward's parrot-cage whenever\r\nhe could get at it, in order to secure the lump of sugar which then\r\nrolled out, or lick up the water which ran from the upset cup; he\r\nevidently intended to pull the parrot's feathers, but the latter, by\r\nturning round as fast as Jack turned, always faced him, and his beak was\r\ntoo formidable to be encountered. I was frequently awakened by the quick\r\ntrampling of feet at this early hour, and knew it arose from a pursuit\r\nof Jack, in consequence of some mischief on his part. Like all other\r\nnautical monkeys, he descended into the forecastle, where he twisted off\r\nthe night-caps of the sailors as they lay in their hammocks, stole their\r\nknives, tools, etc., and if they were not very active in the pursuit,\r\nthese purloinings were thrown overboard.\r\n\r\nWhen the preparations for breakfast began, Jack took his post in a\r\ncorner near the grate, and when the cook's back was turned, hooked out\r\nthe pieces of biscuit which were toasting between the bars for the men,\r\nand snatched the bunches of dried herbs, with which they tried to\r\nimitate tea, out of the tin mugs. He sometimes scalded or burnt his\r\nfingers by these tricks, which kept him quiet for a few days; but no\r\nsooner was the pain gone than he repeated the mischief.\r\n\r\nTwo days in each week, the pigs, which formed part of our live stock,\r\nwere allowed to run about the deck for exercise, and then Jack was\r\nparticularly happy: hiding himself behind a cask, he would suddenly\r\nspring on to the back of one of them, his face to the tail, and away\r\nscampered his frightened steed. Sometimes an obstacle would impede the\r\ngallop, and then Jack, loosening the hold which he had acquired by\r\ndigging his nails into the skin of the pig, industriously tried to\r\nuncurl its tail, and if he were saluted by a laugh from some one near\r\nby, he would look up with an assumed air of wonder, as much as to say;\r\nWhat can you find to laugh at? When the pigs were shut up, he thought it\r\nhis turn to give others a ride, and there were three little monkeys,\r\nwith red skins and blue faces, whom he particularly favored: I\r\nfrequently met him with all of them on his back at the same time,\r\nsqueaking and huddling together, and with difficulty preserving their\r\nseat; when he suddenly stopped, and seemed to ask me to praise the\r\ngood-natured action which he was performing. He was, however, jealous\r\nof all those of his brethren who came in contact with me, and freed\r\nhimself from two of his rivals by throwing them into the sea. One of\r\nthem was a small Lion monkey, of great beauty and extreme gentleness,\r\nand immediately after I had been feeding him, Jack called him with a\r\ncoaxing, patronizing air; but as soon as he was within reach, the\r\nperfidious creature seized him by the nape of his neck, and, as quick as\r\nthought, popped him over the side of the ship. We were going at a brisk\r\nrate, and although a rope was thrown out to him, the poor little\r\nscreaming thing was soon left behind, very much to my distress, for his\r\nalmost human agony of countenance was painful to behold. For this, Jack\r\nwas punished by being shut up all day in the empty hen-coop, in which he\r\nusually passed the night, and which he so hated, that when bed-time\r\ncame, he generally avoided the clutches of the steward; he, however,\r\ncommitted so much mischief when unwatched, that it had become necessary\r\nto confine him at night, and I was often obliged to perform the office\r\nof nursemaid. Jack's principal punishment, however, was to be taken in\r\nfront of the cage in which a panther belonging to me was placed, in the\r\nfore part of the deck. His alarm was intense; the panther set up his\r\nback and growled, but Jack instantly closed his eyes, and made himself\r\nperfectly rigid. I generally held him up by the tail, and if I moved,\r\nhe cautiously opened one eye; but if he caught sight of even a corner of\r\nthe cage, he shut it fast, and again pretended to be dead. His drollest\r\ntrick was practised on a poor little black monkey; taking the\r\nopportunity when a calm, similar to that spoken of above, left him\r\nnearly the sole possessor of the deck. I do not know that he saw me, for\r\nI was sitting behind the companion door. The men had been painting the\r\nship outside, and were putting a broad band of white upon her, when they\r\nwent to dinner below, leaving their paint and brushes on the upper deck.\r\nJack enticed his victim to him, who meekly obeyed the summons; and,\r\nseizing him with one hand, he, with the other, took the brush, and\r\ncovered him with the white fluid from head to foot. The laugh of the man\r\nat the helm called my attention to the circumstance, and as soon as Jack\r\nperceived he was discovered, he dropped his dripping brother, and\r\nrapidly scampered up the rigging, till he gained the main-top, where he\r\nstood with his nose between the bars, looking at what was going on\r\nbelow. As the other monkey began to lick himself, I called up the\r\nsteward, who washed him clean with turpentine, and no harm ensued; but\r\nJack was afraid to come down, and only after three days passed in his\r\nelevated place of refuge did hunger compel him to descend. He chose the\r\nmoment when I was sitting on deck, and, swinging himself by a rope, he\r\ndropped suddenly into my lap, looking so imploringly at me for pardon,\r\nthat I not only forgave him myself, but procured his absolution from\r\nothers. Jack and I parted a little to the south of the Sicily Islands,\r\nafter five month's companionship, and never met again; but I was told\r\nthat he was much distressed at my absence, hunted for me all over the\r\nvessel in the most disconsolate manner, even venturing into my cabin;\r\nnor was he reconciled to the loss of me when the ship's company parted\r\nin the London docks.\r\n\r\nAnother monkey, of the same species as Jack, was trained by a man in\r\nParis to perform a multitude of clever tricks. I met him one day\r\nsuddenly as he was coming up the drawing-room stairs. He made way for me\r\nby standing in an angle, and when I said, \"Good morning,\" took off his\r\ncap, and made me a low bow. \"Are you going away?\" I asked; \"where is\r\nyour passport?\" Upon which he took from the same cap a square piece of\r\npaper which he opened, and shewed to me. His master told him my gown was\r\ndusty, and he instantly took a small brush from his master's pocket,\r\nraised the hem of my dress, cleaned it, and then did the same for my\r\nshoes. He was perfectly docile and obedient; when we gave him something\r\nto eat, he did not cram his pouches with it, but delicately and tidily\r\ndevoured it; and when we bestowed money on him, he immediately put it\r\ninto his master's hands.\r\n\r\nMuch more accomplished monkeys than those of which I have spoken, have\r\nbeen known to act plays, and to assume the characters they have\r\nundertaken, with a spirit and aptitude which might tempt us to suppose\r\nthat they were perfectly cognizant of every bearing of their different\r\nparts; and their stratagems to procure food, and defend themselves, are\r\nonly equalled by human beings.\r\n\r\nDenizens of those mighty forests, which clothe the earth between the\r\ntropics of both the Old and New World, assembling by hundreds in those\r\nlands where the Palm, the Banyan, the Baobab, the Bombax, and thousands\r\nof magnificent trees adorn the soil; where the most delicious fruits are\r\nto be procured, by merely stretching out the hand to separate them from\r\ntheir parent stem; no wonder that both apes and monkeys there\r\ncongregate, and strike the European, on his first arrival among them,\r\nwith astonishment. I had seen many at Cape Coast; but not till I\r\nadvanced into the forest up the windings of the river Gaboon, could I\r\nform any idea of their multitude, or of the various habits which\r\ncharacterize their savage lives. The first time the reality burst upon\r\nme, was in going up a creek of that river to reach the town of Naaengo\r\nwhen the most deafening screams were to be heard over head, mixed with\r\nsqueaks and sundry strange noises. These proceeded from red and grey\r\nparrots, which were pursued to the tops of the tallest trees by the\r\nmonkeys. The birds were not frightened; on the contrary, they appeared\r\nto enjoy the fun, and perching on slight twigs, which would not bear the\r\nweight of their playfellows, they stretched out their wings, and seemed\r\nvociferously to exclaim, \"You can't catch me!\" Sometimes, however, they\r\n_were_ surprised, and then there was such a scuffle and noise. The\r\nfour-handed beast, however, plucked the red feathers from the tail of\r\nthe bird; and careless of its anger, seated himself on a branch, sucking\r\nthe quills till they were dry, when he started for a fresh supply.\r\n\r\nThat monkeys enjoy movement, that they delight in pilfering, in\r\noutwitting each other and their higher brethren--men; that they glory in\r\ntearing and destroying the works of art by which they are surrounded in\r\na domestic state; that they lay the most artful plans to effect their\r\npurposes, is all perfectly true; but the terms _mirthful_ and _merry_,\r\nseem to me to be totally misapplied, in reference to their feelings and\r\nactions; for they do all in solemnity and seriousness. Do you stand\r\nunder a tree, whose thick foliage completely screens you from the sun,\r\nand you hope to enjoy perfect shade and repose; a slight rustling proves\r\nthat companions are near; presently a broken twig drops upon you, then\r\nanother, you raise your eyes, and find that hundreds of other eyes are\r\nstaring at you. In another minute you see the grotesque faces to which\r\nthose eyes belong, making grimaces, as you suppose, but it is no such\r\nthing, they are solemnly contemplating the intruder; they are not\r\npelting him in play, it is their business to drive him from their\r\ndomain. Raise your arm, the boughs shake, the chattering begins, and the\r\nsooner you decamp; the more you will shew your discretion.\r\n\r\nWatch the ape or monkey with which you come into closer contact; does he\r\npick up a blade of grass, he will examine it with as much attention as\r\nif he were determining the value of a precious stone. Do you put food\r\nbefore him, he tucks it into his mouth as fast as possible, and when his\r\ncheek pouches are so full that they cannot hold any more, he looks at\r\nyou as if he seriously asked your approval of his laying up stores for\r\nthe future. If he destroy the most valuable piece of glass or china in\r\nyour possession, he does not look as if he enjoyed the mischief, but\r\neither puts on an impudent air, as much as to say, \"I don't care,\" or\r\ncalmly tries to let you know he thought it his duty to destroy your\r\nproperty. Savage, violent and noisy are they when irritated or\r\ndisappointed, and long do they retain the recollection of an affront. I\r\nonce annoyed a monkey in the collection of the Jardin des Plantes, in\r\nParis, by preventing him from purloining the food of one of his\r\ncompanions; in doing which I gave him a knock upon his paws. It was\r\nlucky that strong wires were between us, or he would probably have hurt\r\nme severely in his rage; he shook the cage, he rolled about and\r\nscreamed, and did not forget the offence. On future occasions, the\r\ninstant he heard my voice, he put himself into a passion: and several\r\nmonths after, although I had been absent the whole time, he seized on my\r\ngown while I incautiously stood too near to him, dragged a portion of it\r\nwithin the bars, and bit a great piece out of it, although it was made\r\nof a very strong material.\r\n\r\nA monkey, of I know not what species, was domiciled in a family in\r\nYorkshire to whom my mother was paying a visit of some days. A large\r\ndinner-party was given in honor of the guest, the master of the house\r\nhelped the soup; but as he was talking at the time, he did not observe\r\nits appearance. Presently all to whom it had been served, laid down\r\ntheir spoons, or sent their plates away. This of course attracted\r\nattention, and on inspection, the liquid was discovered to be full of\r\nshort hairs. The servants in attendance were questioned, but they\r\ndeclared they were ignorant of the cause; and the wisest and politest\r\nproceeding was, to send the tureen from the table, and, serving the\r\nfish, make no further comment. The mistress of the family, however, when\r\nthe ladies left the dining-room, slipped away from her friends, and\r\nsummoning the cook to her presence, received an explanation of the\r\nmystery. The woman said, she had left the kitchen only for one minute,\r\nand when she returned, she saw the monkey standing on the hob of the\r\nkitchen grate, with one fore-paw resting on the lid of the boiler which\r\ncontained the soup. \"Oh, Mr. Curiosity,\" she exclaimed, \"that is too\r\nmuch for you, you can't lift that up.\" To her horror and amazement,\r\nhowever, he _had_ lifted it up, and was putting it on again after\r\npopping the kitten in, whose remains were discovered at the bottom when\r\nthe soup was strained. The poor cook was so bewildered, that she did not\r\nknow what to do: it was time for the dinner to be served, and she,\r\ntherefore, for the look's sake, thought it best to send the soup in as\r\nit was, even if it were sent out again immediately, \"because you know\r\nma'am,\" said she, \"that would prove you had ordered it. I always thought\r\nthe monkey would do the kitten a mischief, he was so jealous of it, and\r\nhated it so because it scratched him, so he seized it when asleep.\"\r\n\r\nA much better disposed monkey belonged to my eldest daughter; and we\r\nbrought him to England from the Gambia. He seemed to know that he could\r\nmaster the child, and did not hesitate to bite and scratch her whenever\r\nshe pulled him a little harder than he thought proper. I punished him\r\nfor each offence, yet fed and caressed him when good; by which means I\r\npossessed an entire ascendancy over him. He was very wretched in London\r\nlodgings, where I was obliged to fasten him to the bars of a stove, and\r\nwhere he had no fresh air; and he was no sooner let loose than he tried\r\nto break everything within his reach; so I persuaded his young mistress\r\nto present him to the Jardin des Plantes. I took him there; and during\r\nmy stay in that place paid him daily visits. When these were\r\ndiscontinued, the keeper told me that he incessantly watched for my\r\nreturn, and it was long before he recovered his disappointment, and made\r\nfriends with his companions in the same cage. Two years after, I again\r\nwent to see him; and when I stood before him and said, \"Mac, do you know\r\nme?\" he gave a scream of delight, put both his paws beyond the bars,\r\nstretched them out to me, held his head down to be caressed, uttering a\r\nlow murmur, and giving every sign of delighted recognition.\r\n\r\nThe most melancholy of all monkeys is, apparently, the Chimpanzee; and\r\nalthough he has perhaps evinced more power of imitating man than any\r\nother, he performs all he does with a sad look, frequently accompanied\r\nby petulance, and occasional bursts of fury. One of the smaller species,\r\nsuch as those which at different times have been brought to England and\r\nParis, was offered to Mr. Bowdich for purchase, while our ship lay in\r\nthe river Gaboon. His owner left him with us for four weeks, during\r\nwhich time I had an opportunity of watching his habits. He would not\r\nassociate with any other of the tribe, not even the irresistible Jack;\r\nbut was becoming reconciled to me, when one unlucky day I checked his\r\ndawning partiality. He followed me to the Panther's cage, and I shall\r\nnever forget the fearful yell which he uttered. He fled as swiftly as\r\npossible, overturning men and boys in his way, with a strength little to\r\nbe expected from his size, nor did he stop till he had thrust himself\r\ninto a boat sail on the after-deck, with which he entirely covered\r\nhimself, and which was thenceforward his favourite abode. It was several\r\ndays before I could reinstate myself in his good opinion, for he\r\nevidently thought I had had something to do with the panther. The latter\r\nhad been in such a fury, that the sailors thought he would have broken\r\nhis cage; and he continued restless and watchful for hours afterwards,\r\nproving that the chimpanzee is found in his country of Ashanti, further\r\nto the north than we had imagined. We did not buy the animal, on account\r\nof the exorbitant sum asked for him, and the risk of his living during a\r\nlong voyage. He was always very sad, but very gentle; and his attachment\r\nto his master was very great, clinging to him like a child, and going\r\njoyfully away in his arms. Of those kept in the Zoological gardens of\r\nEngland and Paris, many anecdotes have been related, evincing great\r\nintelligence. One of the latter used to sit in a chair, lock and unlock\r\nhis door, drink tea with a spoon, eat with a knife and fork, set out\r\nhis own dinner, cry when left alone, and delight in being apparently\r\nconsidered one of his keeper's family.\r\n\r\nIt is in equatorial Africa that the most powerful of all the Quadrumana\r\nlive, far exceeding the Oran Outang, and even the Pongo of Borneo. Mr.\r\nBowdich and myself were the first to revive and confirm a long\r\nforgotten, and vague report of the existence of such a creature, and\r\nmany thought, as we ourselves had not seen it, that we had been deceived\r\nby the natives. They assured us that these huge creatures walk\r\nconstantly on their hind feet, and never yet were taken alive; that they\r\nwatch the actions of men, and imitate them as nearly as possible. Like\r\nthe ivory hunters, they pick up the fallen tusks of elephants, but not\r\nknowing where to deposit them, they carry their burthens about till they\r\nthemselves drop, and even die from fatigue: that they build huts nearly\r\nin the shape of those of men, but live on the outside; and that when one\r\nof their children dies, the mother carries it in her arms till it falls\r\nto pieces; that one blow of their paw will kill a man, and that nothing\r\ncan exceed their ferocity.\r\n\r\nA male and female, of an enormous species of chimpanzee, were brought to\r\nBristol by the master of a vessel coming from the river Gaboon, he had\r\nbeen commissioned to bring them alive, but as this was impracticable,\r\nhe put the male into a puncheon of rum, and the female into a cask of\r\nstrong brine, after they had been shot. The person who had ordered,\r\nrefused to take them, and Professor Owen secured them for the College of\r\nSurgeons. The flesh of that in salt and water fell from the bones, but\r\nit was possible to set the other up so as to have his portrait taken,\r\nwhich likeness is now in the museum of the college. The rum had so\r\ndestroyed the hair, that he could not be stuffed, he was between four\r\nand five feet high, his enormous nails, amounting to claws, were well\r\nadapted for digging roots, and his huge, strong teeth, must have made\r\nhim a formidable antagonist. There could not be any thing much more\r\nhideous than his appearance, even when allowances were made for the\r\ndisfiguring effects of the spirit in which he had been preserved. He was\r\nentirely covered with hair, and not wrinkled and bare in front like the\r\nsmaller Chimpanzee; and it was for some time supposed, that this was the\r\nIngheena reported by Mr. Bowdich. Since then, however, some skulls have\r\nbeen sent to England from the same locality, of much larger proportions,\r\nbetokening an almost marvellous size and strength; and these probably,\r\nbelonged to the real Ingheena. They go about in pairs; and it is evident\r\nfrom their enormous teeth, that, as they are not flesh-eating animals,\r\nthese weapons must have been given to them as means of defence against\r\nthe most powerful enemies; in fact, against each other.\r\n\r\nI now come from my own knowledge and personal experience to those of\r\nothers, and I cannot begin with a more interesting account than that\r\ngiven by Mr. Bennett of the Ungka Ape, or Gibbon of Sumatra, the Simia\r\nSyndactyla of naturalists. He stood two feet high when on his hind legs,\r\nand was covered with black hair, except on the face, the skin of which\r\nwas also black; the legs were short in proportion to the body and arms,\r\nthe latter being exceedingly long. His only pouch was under the throat,\r\nthe use of which was not apparent, for he did not make it a reservoir\r\nfor food. He uttered a squeaking or chirping note when pleased, a hollow\r\nbark when irritated, and when frightened or angry he loudly called out\r\n\"Ra, ra, ra.\" He was as grave as the rest of his tribe, but not equally\r\nmischievous; he, however, frequently purloined the ink, sucking the\r\npens, and drinking the liquid whenever he could get at it. He soon knew\r\nhis name, and readily went to those who called him. The chief object of\r\nhis attachment was a Papuan child; and he would sit with one of his long\r\narms round her neck, share his biscuit with her, run from or after her\r\nin play, roll on the deck, entwining his arms around her, pretend to\r\nbite, swing himself away by means of a rope, and then drop suddenly upon\r\nher, with many other frolics of a childish character. If, however, she\r\ntried to make him play when he was not inclined to do so, he would\r\ngently warn her by a bite, that he would not suffer her to take any\r\nliberties. He made advances to several small monkeys, but they always\r\ndrew themselves up into an opposing force, and he, to punish their\r\nimpertinence, seized hold of their tails, and pulled them till the\r\nsqueaking owners contrived to escape, or he dragged them along by these\r\nappendages up the rigging, and then suddenly let them go, he all the\r\ntime preserving the utmost gravity.\r\n\r\nWhen the hour came for the passengers' dinner he took his station near\r\nthe table, and, if laughed at while eating, barked, inflated his pouch,\r\nand looked at those who ridiculed him in the most serious manner till\r\nthey had finished, when he quietly resumed his own meal. This is often\r\ndone by others of his race, and some seem to inquire what you see to\r\nlaugh at, while others fly into a passion when such an affront is\r\noffered.\r\n\r\nUngka greatly disliked being left alone, and when refused anything which\r\nhe wished for, rolled upon the deck, threw his arms and legs about, and\r\ndashed every thing down which came within his reach, incessantly\r\nuttering \"Ra, ra, ra.\" He had a great fancy for a certain piece of soap,\r\nbut was always scolded when he tried to take it away. One day, when he\r\nthought Mr. Bennett was too busy to observe him, he walked off with it,\r\ncasting glances round to see if he were observed. When he had gone half\r\nthe length of the cabin, Mr. Bennett gently called him; and he was so\r\nconscience-stricken that he immediately returned the soap to its place,\r\nevidently knowing he had done wrong. He was very fond of sweetmeats; but\r\nalthough good friends with those who gave them to him, he would not\r\nsuffer them to take him in their arms, only allowing two persons to use\r\nthat familiarity, and particularly avoiding large whiskers. He felt the\r\ncold extremely as he proceeded on his voyage, was attacked with\r\ndysentery, and died as he came into a northern latitude.\r\n\r\nA female Gibbon was for some time exhibited in London, whose rapid and\r\nenormous springs verified the account given of her brethren by M.\r\nDuvaueel, who said that he had seen one of these animals clear a space\r\nof forty feet, receiving an impetus by merely touching the branch of a\r\ntree, and catching fruit as she sprang: the one in England could stop\r\nherself in the most sudden manner, and calculate her distances with\r\nsurprising accuracy. She uttered a cry of half tones, and ended with a\r\ndeafening shake, which was not unmusical. She made a chirping cry in the\r\nmorning, supposed to be the call for her companions, beginning slowly,\r\nand ending by two barks, which sounded like the tenor E and its octave,\r\nat which time the poor thing became evidently agitated. She was,\r\ngenerally speaking, very gentle, and much preferred ladies to gentlemen;\r\nbut if her confidence had been once acquired, she seemed to place as\r\nmuch reliance on a man as she bestowed unsolicited on a woman.\r\n\r\nMonkeys in India are more or less objects of superstitious reverence,\r\nand are, consequently, seldom, or ever destroyed. In some places they\r\nare even fed, encouraged, and allowed to live on the roofs of the\r\nhouses. If a man wish to revenge himself for any injury committed upon\r\nhim, he has only to sprinkle some rice or corn upon the top of his\r\nenemy's house, or granary, just before the rains set in, and the monkeys\r\nwill assemble upon it, eat all they can find outside, and then pull off\r\nthe tiles to get at that which falls through the crevices. This, of\r\ncourse, gives access to the torrents which fall in such countries, and\r\nhouse, furniture, and stores are all ruined.\r\n\r\nThe large Banyan trees of the Old World are the favourite resorts of\r\nmonkeys and snakes; and the former when they find one of the latter\r\nasleep, seize it by the neck, scramble from their branch, and dash the\r\nreptile's head against a stone, all the time grinning with rage.\r\n\r\nThe Budeng of Java (Semnopithecus Maurus) abounds in the forests of that\r\nisland, and flies from the presence of man, uttering the most fearful\r\nscreams, and using the most violent gestures; but this is not a\r\nfrequent antipathy, and there is an amusing account of the familiarity\r\nwhich monkeys assume with men, written by a traveller, who, probably,\r\nwas not a naturalist, for he does not give the technical appellation of\r\nany of the species with which he meets in India. From what he says,\r\nhowever, I should suppose some of his heroes to be the same as the\r\nMacacus Rhesus. He expresses his surprise, when he sees monkeys \"at\r\nhome,\" for the first time, as being so different to the individuals on\r\nthe tops of organs, or in the menageries of Europe. Their air of\r\nself-possession, comprehension, and right to the soil on which they live\r\nis most amusing. From thirty to forty seated themselves to look at his\r\nadvancing palanquin and bearers, just as villagers watch the strange\r\narrival going to \"the squire's,\" and mingled with the inhabitants,\r\njostling the naked children, and stretching themselves at full length\r\nclose to the seated human groups, with the most perfect freedom. This\r\nfreedom often amounts to impudence; and they frequent the tops of\r\nbazaars, in order to steal all they can lay their hands upon below. The\r\nonly way to keep them off, is to cover the roof with a prickly shrub,\r\nthe thorns of which stick to the flesh like fishhooks. The above\r\nmentioned traveller watched one, which he calls a _bandar_, and which\r\ntook his station opposite to a sweetmeat shop. He pretended to be\r\nasleep, but every now and then softly raised his head to look at the\r\ntempting piles and the owner of them, who sat smoking his pipe without\r\nsymptoms even of a dose. In half an hour the monkey got up, as if he\r\nwere just awake, yawned, stretched himself, and took another position a\r\nfew yards off, where he pretended to play with his tail, occasionally\r\nlooking over his shoulder at the coveted delicacies. At length the\r\nshop-man gave signs of activity, and the bandar was on the alert; the man\r\nwent to his back room, the bandar cleared the street at one bound, and\r\nin an instant stuffed his pouches full of the delicious morsels. He had,\r\nhowever, overlooked some hornets, which were regaling themselves at the\r\nsame time. They resented his disturbance, and the tormented bandar, in\r\nhis hurry to escape, came upon a thorn-covered roof, where he lay,\r\nstung, torn, and bleeding. He spurted the stolen bon-bons from his\r\npouches, and barking hoarsely, looked the picture of misery. The noise\r\nof the tiles which he had dislodged in his retreat brought out the\r\ninhabitants, and among them the vendor of sweets, with his turban\r\nunwound, and streaming two yards behind him. All joined in laughing at\r\nthe wretched monkey; but their religious reverence for him induced them\r\nto go to his assistance; they picked out his thorns, and he limped away\r\nto the woods quite crestfallen.\r\n\r\nThe traveller came in constant contact with monkeys in his occupations\r\nof clearing land and planting, and at first, as he lay still among the\r\nbrushwood, they gamboled round him as they would round the natives.\r\nThis peaceable state of things, however, did not last, when he\r\nestablished a field of sugar-canes in the newly-cleared jungle. He tells\r\nthe story so well, that I must be allowed to use his own expressions:--\r\n\r\n\"Every beast of the field seemed leagued against this devoted patch of\r\nsugar-cane. The wild elephants came, and browsed in it; the jungle hogs\r\nrooted it up, and munched it at their leisure; the jackals gnawed the\r\nstalks into squash; and the wild deer ate the tops of the young plants.\r\nAgainst all these marauders there was an obvious remedy--to build a\r\nstout fence round the cane field. This was done accordingly, and a deep\r\ntrench dug outside, that even the wild elephant did not deem it prudent\r\nto cross.\r\n\r\n\"The wild hogs came and inspected the trench and the palisades beyond. A\r\nbristly old tusker was observed taking a survey of the defenses; but,\r\nafter mature deliberation, he gave two short grunts, the porcine\r\n(language), I imagined, for 'No go,' and took himself off at a round\r\ntrot, to pay a visit to my neighbour Ram Chunder, and inquire how his\r\nlittle plot of sweet yams was coming on. The jackals sniffed at every\r\ncrevice, and determined to wait a bit; but the monkeys laughed the whole\r\nintrenchment to scorn. Day after day was I doomed to behold my canes\r\ndevoured, as fast as they ripened, by troops of jubilant monkeys. It was\r\nof no use attempting to drive them away. When disturbed, they merely\r\nretreated to the nearest tree, dragging whole stalks of sugar-cane along\r\nwith them, and then spurted the chewed fragments in my face, as I looked\r\nup at them. This was adding insult to injury, and I positively began to\r\ngrow blood-thirsty at the idea of being outwitted by monkeys. The case\r\nbetween us might have been stated in this way.\r\n\r\n\"'I have, at much trouble and expense, cleared and cultivated this\r\njungle land,' said I.\r\n\r\n\"'More fool you,' said the monkeys.\r\n\r\n\"'I have planted and watched over these sugar-canes.'\r\n\r\n\"'Watched! ah, ha! so have we for the matter of that.'\r\n\r\n\"'But, surely I have a right to reap what I sowed?'\r\n\r\n\"'Don't see it,' said the monkeys; 'the jungle, by rights prescriptive\r\nand indefensible, is ours, and has been so ever since the days of Ram\r\nHonuman of the long tail. If you cultivate the jungle without our\r\nconsent you must look to the consequences. If you don't like our\r\ncustoms, you may get about your business. We don't want you.'\r\n\r\n\"I kept brooding over this mortifying view of the matter, until one\r\nmorning I hatched revenge in a practicable shape. A tree, with about a\r\nscore of monkeys on it, was cut down, and half-a-dozen of the youngest\r\nwere caught as they attempted to escape. A large pot of _ghow_ (treacle)\r\nwas then mixed with as much tartar emetic as could be spared from the\r\nmedicine chest, and the young hopefuls, after being carefully painted\r\nover with the compound, were allowed to return to their distressed\r\nrelatives, who, as soon as they arrived, gathered round them, and\r\ncommenced licking them with the greatest assiduity. The results I had\r\nanticipated were not long in making their appearance. A more melancholy\r\nsight it was impossible to behold; but so efficacious was this\r\ntreatment, that for more than two years I hardly ever saw a monkey in\r\nthe neighbourhood.\"\r\n\r\nWhen we read of the numbers, the intelligence, and the audacity of\r\nmonkeys in this part of the world, it becomes a matter of curious\r\nspeculation as to how they will behave when the railroad is made across\r\nIndia.\r\n\r\nIt has been frequently observed, that there is nothing more distressing\r\nthan to see a wounded or suffering monkey. He lays his hand upon the\r\npart affected, and looks up in your face, as if appealing to your kindly\r\nfeelings; and if blood flow, he views it with so frightened an\r\nexpression, that he seems to know his life is going from him. An\r\ninquisitive monkey, among the numerous company which sailed in a ship,\r\nalways seemed desirous of ascertaining the nature of everything around\r\nhim, and touched, tasted, and closely scrutinized every object to which\r\nhe had not been accustomed. A pot of scalding pitch was in use for\r\ncaulking the seams of the upper deck, and when those who were employed\r\nin laying it upon the planks turned their heads from him, he dipped one\r\npaw into it, and carrying it to his chin, rubbed himself with the\r\ndestructive substance. His yell of pain called the attention of the\r\nsailors to him, and they did all in their power to afford alleviation;\r\nthe pitch was taken off as well as it could be, his pouches being\r\nentirely burnt away, his poor cheeks were wrapped up with rags steeped\r\nin turpentine; and his scalded hand was bandaged in the same manner. He\r\nwas a piteous sight, and seemed to look on all who came near, as if\r\nasking for their commiseration. He was very gentle and very sad,\r\nsubmitted to be fed with sugar and water through a tube, but after a few\r\ndays he laid his head down and expired.\r\n\r\nMr. Forbes tells a story of a female monkey, (the Semnopithecus\r\nEntellus), who was shot by a friend of his, and carried to his tent.\r\nForty or fifty of her tribe advanced with menacing gestures, but stood\r\nstill when the gentleman presented his gun at them. One, however, who\r\nappeared to be the chief of the tribe, came forward, chattering and\r\nthreatening in a furious manner. Nothing short of firing at him seemed\r\nlikely to drive him away; but at length he approached the tent door with\r\nevery sign of grief and supplication, as if he were begging for the\r\nbody. It was given to him, he took it in his arms, carried it away, with\r\nactions expressive of affection, to his companions, and with them\r\ndisappeared. It was not to be wondered at that the sportsman vowed never\r\nto shoot another monkey.\r\n\r\nMonkeys are eaten in some parts of the Old World, and universally in\r\nSouth America. M. Bonpland speaks of the flesh as lean, hard and dry;\r\nbut that which I tasted in Africa, was white, juicy, and like chicken.\r\nMr. Bowdich had monkeys served whole before him at the table of the king\r\nof Ashanti, having been roasted in a sitting posture, and he said,\r\nnothing could be more horrid or repugnant than their appearance, with\r\nthe skin of the lips dried, and the white teeth, giving an aspect of\r\ngrinning from pain.\r\n\r\nThe howling monkeys of South America, who make the forests resound at\r\nnight, or before a coming storm, with their hideous choruses, and whose\r\nhollow and enlarged tongue bone, and expanded lower jaw enable them to\r\nutter those melancholy and startling cries, are larger and fatter than\r\nmany others in the same country, and are constantly sought for as food.\r\nThey eat the thick, triangular Brazil nuts (Bertholletia Excelsa), and\r\nbreak the hard pod which contains them with a stone, laying it on the\r\nbough of a tree, or some other stone. They sometimes get their tail\r\nbetween the two, of course the blow falls upon the tail, and the monkey\r\nbounds away, howling in the most frightful manner.\r\n\r\nThe prettiest of all monkeys is the Marmozet; the Ouistiti of Buffon;\r\nthe Simia Jacchus of Linnaeus. It is extremely sensitive to cold;\r\nnevertheless, if plentifully supplied with wool, cotton, and other warm\r\nmaterials, will live for years in this climate. Dr. Neill of Edinburgh,\r\nthat most excellent protector and lover of animals, brought one from\r\nBahia, which he found great difficulty in training. It even resisted\r\nthose who fed it, not allowing them to touch it, putting on an angry,\r\nsuspicious look, and being roused by even the slightest whisper. During\r\nthe voyage it ate corn and fruit, and when these became scarce, took to\r\ncockroaches; of which it cleared the vessel. It would dispatch twenty\r\nlarge, besides smaller ones, three or four times in each day, nipping\r\noff the head of the former, and rejecting the viscera, legs, and hard\r\nwing cases. Besides these, it fed on milk, sugar, raisins, and\r\nbread-crumbs. It afterwards made friends with a cat, and slept and eat\r\nwith this animal, but it never entirely lost its distrustful feelings.\r\n\r\nLieutenant Edwards, in his voyage up the Amazon, mentions a domestic\r\nwhite monkey, which had contrived to get to the top of a house, and no\r\npersuasions or threats could get him down again. He ran over the roof,\r\ndisplaced the tiles, peeped into the chambers below (for there are no\r\nceilings in that country), and when called, put his thumb up to his\r\nnose. He was shot at with corn, but having found a rag, he held it up\r\nbefore him, and so tried to evade the shot; every now and then peeping\r\nover the top. At last he was left to himself; and when no endeavours\r\nwere made to get him down, he came of his own accord. Captain Brown\r\nmentions a monkey, who, when he was troublesome in the cabin of a ship,\r\nwas fired at with gunpowder and currant jelly; and in order to defend\r\nhimself, used to pick up the favorite monkey, and hold him between the\r\npistol and himself when it was presented.\r\n\r\nA race of animals exists in Madagascar, and some of the Eastern islands,\r\nto which the name of Maki has been given, and which, although differing\r\nin the formation of the skull and teeth, must, from having four hands,\r\nbe placed among the Quadrumana. They are nocturnal in their habits, very\r\ngentle and confiding, with apparently one exception, which is called the\r\nVari. M. Frederic Cuvier has told us, that two of these being shut up in\r\na cage together, one killed and eat his companion, leaving nothing but\r\nthe skin. Two of them are remarkable for their slow, deliberate\r\nmovements; and one of them, named the Lemur Tardigradus, was procured\r\nat Prince of Wales's Island by Mr. Baird. He tells us that his eyes\r\nshone brightly in the dark, and that he moved his eyelids diagonally,\r\ninstead of up and down. He had two tongues, one rough like that of a\r\ncat, the other narrow and sharp, and both projected at the same time,\r\nunless he chose to retain the latter. He generally slept rolled up like\r\na ball, with his arms over his head, taking hold of his cage. He and a\r\ndog lived together in the same cage, and a great attachment subsisted\r\nbetween them; but nothing could reconcile him to a cat, which constantly\r\njumped over his back, thereby causing him great annoyance.\r\n\r\nI cannot better close this notice of Monkeys than by giving a curious\r\nlegend which is told in Northwestern Africa, and which is more uncommon\r\nthan the belief, which is to be found in most countries, that \"monkeys\r\ncan talk if they like, but they won't, for fear white men should make\r\nthem work.\" It was related by the negroes to each other with infinite\r\nhumour; the different voices of the characters were assumed, and the\r\ngestures and countenance were in accordance with the tale.\r\n\r\n\"There was once a big and a strong man, who was a cook, and he married a\r\nwoman who thought herself very much above him, so she only accepted him\r\non condition that she should never be asked to go into the cook-house\r\n(kitchen), but live in a separate dwelling. They were married, and all\r\nthe house he had for her was the kitchen; but she did not at first\r\ncomplain, because she was afraid to make her husband unhappy. At last\r\nshe became so tired of her life, that she began to find fault; but at\r\nfirst was very gentle. At last she scolded incessantly, and the man, to\r\nkeep her quiet, told her he would go to the bush (forest), and fetch\r\nwood to build her a new house. He went away, and in a few hours brought\r\nsome wood. The next day his wife told him to go and fetch some more.\r\nAgain he went away, stayed all day, and only brought home a few sticks,\r\nwhich made her so angry, that she took the biggest and beat him with it.\r\nThe man went away a third time, and stayed all night, not bringing home\r\nany wood at all, saying that the trees which he had cut down were so\r\nheavy that he could not bring them all the way. Then he went and stayed\r\ntwo days and nights, which made his wife very unhappy. She cried very\r\nmuch, intreated him not to leave her, promised not to scold or beat him\r\nany more, and to live contentedly in the kitchen; but he answered 'No!\r\nyou made me go to the bush, now I like the bush very much, and I shall\r\ngo and stop there for ever.' So saying, he rushed out of the cook-house\r\ninto the bush, where he turned into a monkey, and from him came all\r\nother monkeys.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBATS.\r\n\r\n\r\nA race of beings, to which the epithet mysterious may be with some truth\r\napplied, affords more interest from its peculiar habits, than from any\r\nproof which can be given of its mental powers; and its place in this\r\nwork is due to the marvellous histories which have been related\r\nconcerning it, and which have made it an object of superstitious alarm.\r\n\r\nBats, or Cheiroptera, are particularly distinguished from all other\r\ncreatures which suckle their young, by possessing the power of flight. A\r\nLemur Galeopithecus, which exists in the Eastern part of the globe,\r\ntakes long sweeps from tree to tree, and owes this faculty to the\r\nextension of its skin between its fore and hind limbs, including the\r\ntail; but it cannot be really said to fly. The Bats, then, alone enjoy\r\nthis privilege; and the prolongation of what, in common parlance, we\r\nshould call the arms and fingers, constitutes the framework which\r\nsupports the skin, or membrane forming the wings. The thumbs, however,\r\nare left free, and serve as hooks for various purposes. The legs, and\r\ntail (when they have any), generally help to extend the membrane of the\r\nwing; and the breast-bone is so formed as to support the powerful\r\nmuscles which aid their locomotive peculiarities. They climb and crawl\r\nwith great dexterity, and some will run when on the ground; but it is\r\ndifficult for most of them to move on a smooth, horizontal surface, and\r\nthey drag themselves along by their thumbs. A portion of the Cheiroptera\r\nfeeds on insects, and another on fruits; one genus subsists chiefly on\r\nblood. The first help to clear the atmosphere of those insects which fly\r\nat twilight; the second are very destructive to our gardens and\r\norchards; the last are especially the object of that superstitious fear\r\nto which I have already alluded. They are all nocturnal or crepuscular,\r\nand during the day remain suspended by the sharp claws of their feet to\r\nthe under-branches of trees, the roofs of caves, subterranean quarries,\r\nor old ruins, hanging with their heads downwards; multitudes live in the\r\ntombs of Egypt.\r\n\r\nThe appearance of Bats is always more or less grotesque; but this term\r\nmore aptly applies to those which live on animal food, in consequence of\r\nthe additions made to the nose and ears, probably for the sake of\r\nincreasing their always acute senses of smell and hearing. The ears are\r\nfrequently of an enormous size, and are joined together at the back of\r\nthe head; besides which they have leaf, or lance-shaped appendages in\r\nfront. A membrane of various forms is also often attached to the nose,\r\nin one species the shape of a horse-shoe. The bodies are always covered\r\nwith hair, but the wings consist of a leathery membrane. Another\r\nsingularity in one genus is the extremity of the spine being converted\r\ninto two jointed, horny pieces, covered with skin, so as to form a box\r\nof two valves, each having an independent motion. The large bats of the\r\nEast Indies measure five feet from the tip of one wing to that of the\r\nother, and they emit a musky odour. The skin of the Nycteris Geoffroyi\r\nis very loose upon the body; and the animal draws air through openings\r\nin the cheek pouches, head, and back, and swells itself into a little\r\nballoon; the openings being closed at pleasure by means of valves. The\r\nbite of all is extremely sharp; and we seldom hear of an instance of one\r\nbeing tamed. They try to shelter themselves from chilly winds, and\r\nfrequent sheltered spots, abounding in masonry, rocks, trees, and small\r\nstreams.\r\n\r\nAbout the Vampire, or the blood-sucker, there are different opinions:\r\nthat of the East is said to be quite harmless; but it is asserted that\r\nthe South American species love to attach themselves to all cattle,\r\nespecially to horses with long manes, because they can cling to the hair\r\nwhile they suck the veins, and keep their victim quiet by flapping their\r\nwings over its head; they also fasten themselves upon the tail for the\r\nfirst reason, and a great loss of blood frequently ensues. Fowls are\r\nfrequently killed by them as they roost upon their perches, for so\r\nnoiseless and gentle are they in their flight and operations, that\r\nanimals are not awakened out of their sleep by their attacks. The teeth\r\nare so disposed that they make a deep and triple puncture, and one was\r\ntaken by Mr. Darwin in the act of sucking blood from the neck of a\r\nhorse. This able naturalist and accurate observer is of opinion, that\r\nhorses do not suffer from the quantity of blood taken from them by the\r\nVampire, but from the inflammation of the wound which they make, and\r\nwhich is increased if the saddle presses on it. Horses, however, turned\r\nout to grass at night, are frequently found the next morning with their\r\nnecks and haunches covered with blood; and it is known that the bat\r\nfills and disgorges itself several times. Dr. Carpenter is of the same\r\nopinion as Mr. Darwin, and also disbelieves that these creatures soothe\r\ntheir victims by fanning them with their wings.\r\n\r\nCaptain Stedman, who travelled in Guiana, from 1772 to 1777, published\r\nan account of his adventures, and for several years afterwards, it was\r\nthe fashion to doubt the truth of his statements. In fact, it was a\r\ngeneral feeling, up to a much later period than the above, that\r\ntravellers were not to be believed. As our knowledge, however, has\r\nincreased, and the works of God have been made more manifest, the\r\nreputation of many a calumniated traveller has been restored, and, among\r\nothers, that of Captain Stedman. I shall, therefore, unhesitatingly\r\nquote his account of the bite of the vampire, \"On waking, about four\r\no'clock this morning, in my hammock, I was extremely alarmed at finding\r\nmyself weltering in congealed blood, and without feeling any pain\r\nwhatever. Having started up and run to the surgeon, with a firebrand in\r\none hand, and all over besmeared with gore, the mystery was found to be,\r\nthat I had been bitten by the vampire or specter of Guiana, which is\r\nalso called the flying dog of New Spain. This is no other than a bat of\r\nmonstrous size, that sucks the blood from men and cattle, sometimes even\r\ntill they die; knowing, by instinct, that the person they intend to\r\nattack is in a sound slumber, they generally alight near the feet,\r\nwhere, while the creature continues fanning with his enormous wings,\r\nwhich keeps one cool, he bites a piece out of the tip of the great toe,\r\nso very small indeed, that the head of a pin could scarcely be received\r\ninto the wound, which is consequently not painful; yet, through this\r\norifice, he contrives to suck the blood, until he is obliged to\r\ndisgorge. He then begins again, and thus continues sucking and\r\ndisgorging till he is scarcely able to fly, and the sufferer has often\r\nbeen known to sleep from time into eternity. Cattle they generally bite\r\nin the ear, but always in those places where the blood flows\r\nspontaneously. Having applied tobacco-ashes as the best remedy, and\r\nwashed the gore from myself and my hammock, I observed several small\r\nheaps of congealed blood all around the place where I had lain, upon\r\nthe ground; upon examining which, the surgeon judged that I had lost at\r\nleast twelve or fourteen ounces during the night. Having measured this\r\ncreature (one of the bats), I found it to be, between the tips of the\r\nwings, thirty-two inches and a half; the colour was a dark brown, nearly\r\nblack, but lighter underneath.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Waterton, whom all the world recognizes as a gentleman, and\r\nconsequently a man of truth, laboured at one time under the same stigma\r\nof exaggeration as Captain Stedman, and many other illustrious\r\ntravellers; and he confirms the blood-sucking in the following\r\nterms:--\"Some years ago, I went to the river Paumarau, with a Scotch\r\ngentleman. We hung our hammocks in the thatched loft of a planter's\r\nhouse. Next morning I heard this gentleman muttering in his hammock, and\r\nnow and then letting fall an imprecation or two, 'What is the matter,\r\nSir,' said I softly, 'is anything amiss?' 'What is the matter!' answered\r\nhe surlily, 'why the vampires have been sucking me to death.' As soon as\r\nthere was light enough, I went to his hammock, and saw it much stained\r\nwith blood. 'There,' said he, thrusting his foot out of the hammock,\r\n'see how these imps have been drawing my life's blood.' On examining his\r\nfoot, I found the vampire had tapped his great toe. There was a wound\r\nsomewhat less than that made by a leech. The blood was still oozing from\r\nit, and I conjectured he might have lost from ten to twelve ounces of\r\nblood.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Waterton further tells us, that a boy of ten or eleven years of age\r\nwas bitten by a vampire, and a poor ass, belonging to the young\r\ngentleman's father, was dying by inches from the bites of the larger\r\nkinds, while most of his fowls were killed by the smaller bats.\r\n\r\nThe torpidity in which bats remain during the winter, in climates\r\nsimilar to that of England, is well known; and, like other animals which\r\nundergo the same suspension of powers, they have their histories of long\r\nimprisonment in places which seem inimical to life. There are two\r\naccounts of their being found in trees, which are extremely curious, and\r\nthe more so, because the one corroborates the other. In the beginning of\r\nNovember, 1821, a woodman, engaged in splitting timber for rail-posts,\r\nin the woods close by the lake at Haining, a seat of Mr. Pringle's, in\r\nSelkirkshire, discovered, in the centre of a large wild-cherry tree, a\r\nliving bat, of a bright scarlet colour, which, as soon as it was\r\nrelieved from its entombment, took to its wings and escaped. In the tree\r\nthere was a recess sufficiently large to contain the animal; but all\r\naround, the wood was perfectly sound, solid, and free from any fissure\r\nthrough which the atmospheric air could reach the animal.\r\n\r\nA man engaged in splitting timber, near Kelsall, in the beginning of\r\nDecember, 1826, discovered, in the centre of a large pear-tree, a living\r\nbat, of a bright scarlet colour, which he foolishly suffered to escape,\r\nfrom fear, being fully persuaded (with the characteristic superstition\r\nof the inhabitants of that part of Cheshire), that it was \"a being not\r\nof this world.\" The tree presented a small cavity in the centre, where\r\nthe bat was enclosed, but was perfectly sound and solid on each side.\r\nThe scarlet colour of each of these prisoners seems at present to be\r\ninexplicable, and makes these statements still more marvellous.\r\n\r\nProfessor Bell, in his admirable work on British Quadrupeds speaks of a\r\nlong-eared bat which fed from the hand; and if an insect were held\r\nbetween the lips, it would settle on its master's cheek, and take the\r\nfly from his mouth with great quietness. So accustomed was it to this,\r\nthat it would seek his lips when he made a buzzing noise. It folded its\r\nbeautiful ears under its arm when it went to sleep, and also during\r\nhibernation. Its cry was acute and shrill, becoming more clear and\r\npiercing when disturbed. It is most frequently seen in towns and\r\nvillages. This instance of taming to a certain extent might, perhaps, be\r\nmore frequently repeated, if bats were objects of more general\r\ninterest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMOLES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is a tribe of animals constantly around our country habitations,\r\nof underground and nocturnal habits, some of which become torpid in\r\nwinter. All are timid and unobtrusive, and yet have great influence upon\r\nour welfare; for they check the rapid increase of those worms and\r\ninsects which live and breed beneath the soil, and would destroy the\r\ncrops which are necessary to our existence. There are certain and\r\nconstant characters in their formation, which bring them all under one\r\ngroup, called Insectivora, or Insect-eating Mammalia, by naturalists;\r\nbut among them are smaller groups of individuals, with peculiar\r\ncharacters, adapted to their different habits.\r\n\r\nThe mole is an instance of one of these minor groups; which, with one\r\nexception, has a portion of sight in spite of its reputation for being\r\nblind. Its smell and hearing, however, are so acute, that they make up\r\nfor the deficiency in the other sense, a highly developed organ for\r\nwhich, would be very much in the way of an animal which makes its\r\nhabitation within the earth, and which rarely comes to the surface in\r\nthe day time. Its fore-feet are largest, and powerful muscles enable it\r\nto dig up the soil and roots which oppose the formation of its\r\ngalleries, and which are thrown up as they become loosened. The nose,\r\nor snout, is furnished with a bone at the end, with which it pierces the\r\nearth, and in one genus this bone has twenty-two small, cartilaginous\r\npoints attached to it, which can be extended into a star. A vein lies\r\nbehind the ear of all, the smallest puncture of which causes instant\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\nThe food of moles chiefly consists of worms, and the larvae, or grubs of\r\ninsects, of which they eat enormous quantities. They are extremely\r\nvoracious, and the slightest privation of food drives them to frenzy, or\r\nkills them. They will all eat flesh, and when shut up in a cage without\r\nnourishment, have been known to devour each other. There is a remarkable\r\ninstance of a mole, when in confinement, having a viper and a toad given\r\nto it, both of which it killed and devoured. All squeeze out the earthy\r\nmatter which is inside worms, before eating them, which they do with the\r\nmost eager rapidity. In June and July, they prowl upon the surface of\r\nthe ground, generally at night, but they have been seen by day, and this\r\nis the time in which they indulge in fleshy food, for then they catch\r\nsmall birds, mice, frogs, lizards, and snails; but although when in\r\nconfinement one was known to eat a toad, they generally refuse these\r\nreptiles, probably from the acrid humour which exudes from their skin.\r\nThey, on these occasions of open marauding, are often caught and\r\ndevoured in their turn by owls at night, and dogs by day. They have a\r\nremarkable power of eating the roots of the colchicum, or meadow\r\nsaffron, which takes such powerful effect on other animals, and which\r\nthey probably swallow for the sake of the larvae or worms upon them. Such\r\nis their antipathy to garlic, that a few cloves put into their runs,\r\nwill cause their destruction.\r\n\r\nA French naturalist, of the name of Henri Lecourt, devoted a great part\r\nof his life to the study of the habits and structure of moles, and he\r\ntells us, that they will run as fast as a horse will gallop. By his\r\nobservations he rendered essential service to a large district in\r\nFrance, for he discovered that numbers of moles had undermined the banks\r\nof a canal, and that, unless means were taken to prevent the\r\ncatastrophe, these banks would give way, and inundation would ensue. By\r\nhis ingenious contrivances and accurate knowledge of their habits, he\r\ncontrived to extirpate them before the occurrence of further mischief.\r\nMoles, however, are said to be excellent drainers of land, and Mr. Hogg,\r\nthe Ettrick Shepherd, used to declare, that if a hundred men and horses\r\nwere employed to dress a pasture farm of 1,500 or 2,000 acres, they\r\nwould not do it as effectually as moles would do if left to themselves.\r\n\r\nThe late Earl of Derby possessed a small deserted island, in the Loch of\r\nClunie, 180 yards from the main land, and as proof that moles swim well,\r\na number of them crossed the water, and took possession of this place.\r\nThey are said to be dragged, as beavers are, by their companions, who\r\nlay hold of their tail, and pull them along while they lie on their\r\nbacks, embracing a quantity of soil dug out in forming their runs. The\r\nfur of the mole is very short, fine, and close, and is as smooth and\r\nsoft as Genoa velvet.\r\n\r\nMoles display a high degree of instinct in the skilful construction of\r\ntheir subterranean fortresses. Their site is not indicated by those\r\nlittle mounds of loose earth, which we see raised up at night, and which\r\nmark their hunting excursions, but under a hillock reared by themselves,\r\nand protected by a wall, bank, or roots of a tree. The earth is well\r\nworked, so as to make it compact and hard, and galleries are formed\r\nwhich communicate with each other. A circular gallery is placed at the\r\nupper part of the mound, and five descending passages lead from this to\r\na gallery below, which is of larger circumference. Within this lower\r\ngallery is a chamber, which communicates with the upper gallery by three\r\ndescending tunnels. This chamber is, as it were, the citadel of the\r\nmole, in which it sleeps.\r\n\r\nA principal gallery goes from the lower gallery, in a direct line to the\r\nutmost extent of the ground through which the mole hunts, and from the\r\nbottom of this dormitory is another, which descends farther into the\r\nearth, and joins this great or principal road. Eight or nine other\r\ntunnels run round the hillock at irregular distances, leading from the\r\nlower gallery, through which the mole hunts its prey, and which it\r\nconstantly enlarges. During this process it throws up the hillocks which\r\nbetray its vicinity to us. The great road is of various depths,\r\naccording to the quality of the soil in which it is excavated; it is\r\ngenerally five or six inches below the surface, but if carried under a\r\nstream, or pathway, it will be occasionally sunk a foot and a half. If\r\nthe hillock be very extensive there will be several high-roads, and they\r\nwill serve for several moles, but they never trespass on each other's\r\nhunting grounds. If they happen to meet in a road, one is obliged to\r\nretreat, or they have a battle, in which the weakest always comes off\r\nthe worst. In a barren soil, the searching galleries are the most\r\nnumerous, and those made in winter are the deepest, because the worms\r\npenetrate beyond the line of frost, and the mole is as active in winter\r\nas in warm weather.\r\n\r\nThe females have a separate chamber made for them, in which they bring\r\nforth their young. This is situated at some distance from the citadel,\r\nand placed where three or four galleries intersect each other. There\r\nthey have a bed made of dry grass, or fibres of roots, and four or five\r\nyoung are born at the same time, which begin to get their own food when\r\nthey are half grown.\r\n\r\nLike all voracious animals, moles require a large quantity of water,\r\nconsequently their run, or fortress, generally communicates with a ditch\r\nor pond. Should these dry up, or the situation be without such\r\nresources, the little architect sinks perpendicular wells, which retain\r\nthe water as it drains from the soil.\r\n\r\nMoles shift their quarters according to circumstances, and as they swim\r\nwell, they migrate across rivers; and in sudden inundations are able,\r\nnot to save themselves alone, but their young, to which they are much\r\nattached. The stratagem and caution which they practise in order to\r\nsecure a bird are highly curious: they approach without seeming to do\r\nso, but as soon as they are within reach of their prey, they rush upon\r\nit, tear open its body, thrust their snout into the intestines, and\r\nrevel in their sanguinary feast. They then sleep for three or four\r\nhours, and awake with renewed appetite.\r\n\r\nAll mole-catchers will bear testimony to the rapid movements and\r\nconsequent difficulty of catching these animals. I have watched a\r\ngardener stand for half an hour by one of the little hillocks of loose\r\nearth, which, from its movement, showed that the mole was there at work,\r\nand remain motionless, spade in hand, and when he saw the earth shake,\r\ndash his weapon into the heap. The mere uplifting of his arm was\r\nsufficient, and before the spade could reach the ground the mole was\r\ngone. He could scarcely reckon on securing his victim once out of\r\ntwenty efforts.\r\n\r\nNo moles are found in the north of Scotland, or in Ireland, which some\r\nattribute to soil and climate; but they exist in other parts of Europe\r\nunder similar circumstances.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHEDGEHOGS.\r\n\r\n\r\nHedgehogs form one of the small groups of insect-eating mammalia, and\r\nare remarkable for being also able to eat those substances which are\r\ndestructive to others; for instance, they will devour the wings of\r\nSpanish flies (Cantharides) with impunity, which cause fearful torments\r\nto other animals, and not the least to man, by raising blisters on his\r\nskin. It would seem that the hedgehog is also externally insensible to\r\npoison, for it fights with adders, and is bitten about the lips and nose\r\nwithout receiving any injury. An experiment has been made by\r\nadministering prussic acid to it, which took no effect.\r\n\r\nIt is well known that hedgehogs are covered with bristles, amounting to\r\nsharp prickles, and that they roll themselves up into a ball. This is\r\neffected by a peculiar set of muscles attached to the skin, by which\r\nthey pull themselves into this shape, and at the same time set up every\r\nbristle, and drag their head and limbs within. Such is the resistance\r\nand elasticity of these bristles, that the owners of them may be thrown\r\nto great distances and remain unhurt, and they will even throw\r\nthemselves down steep places when they wish to move from a particular\r\nspot.\r\n\r\nHedgehogs are nocturnal animals, and frequent woods, gardens, orchards,\r\nand thick hedge-rows. It is in the latter that I have heard of one being\r\nmistaken by a hen for a bush, in which she might lay her egg in safety.\r\nThe fact was announced by the triumphant cackling which these birds\r\nvociferate on such occasions: the egg was consequently searched for, and\r\nfound upon the hedgehog's back.\r\n\r\nHedgehogs feed on insects, slugs, frogs, eggs, young birds in the nest,\r\nmice, fallen fruits, and the roots of vegetables, especially the\r\nplantain, boring into the ground to get at these substances. They will\r\nclear a house of black beetles in a few weeks, as I can attest from my\r\nown experience. My kitchen was much infested, not only by them, but by a\r\nsort of degenerated cockroach, descended from the better conditioned\r\nBlattae, brought in my packages from a tropical country, and which had\r\nresisted all efforts for their extermination, such as boiling water,\r\npepper, arsenic-wafers, mortar, etc. At last, a friend, whose house had\r\nbeen cleared of beetles by a hedgehog, made the animal over to me, very\r\nmuch to the discomfort of my cook, to whom it was an object of terror.\r\nThe first night of its arrival a bed was made for it in a hamper, half\r\nfull of hay, and a saucer of milk was set within. The next morning the\r\nhedgehog had disappeared, and for several days the search made for it\r\nwas fruitless. That it was alive was proved by the milk being drunk out\r\nof the saucer in which it was placed. One night I purposely went into\r\nthe kitchen after the family had been for some time in bed, and, as I\r\nopened the door, I saw the little creature slink into a hole under the\r\noven attached to the grate. Fearing this would sometimes prove too hot\r\nfor it, I had some bricks put in to fill up the aperture. The next night\r\nthe bricks were pulled away, and overturned, evincing a degree of\r\nstrength which astonished us; but, after that, we left the animal to its\r\nown care. The beetles and cockroaches visibly disappeared, but as they\r\ndisappeared other things also vanished; kitchen cloths left to dry at\r\nnight were missing; then, a silk handkerchief. At last a night-cap left\r\non the dresser was gone; and these abstractions were most mysterious.\r\nThe next day there was a general search in possible and impossible\r\nplaces, and the end of a muslin string was seen in the oven-hole; it was\r\nseized on, and not only was the night-cap dragged out, but all the\r\nmissing and not missing articles which the hedgehog had purloined; most\r\nof them were much torn, and it was supposed that the poor beast had\r\ntaken possession of them to make a soft bed. I have not seen such a\r\npropensity noticed elsewhere, and it may be a useful hint to those who\r\nkeep hedgehogs. All endeavours to make this animal friendly were\r\nunavailing; but I am told, that hedgehogs are frequently quite\r\ndomesticated; and even shew a degree of affection.\r\n\r\nDr. Buckland ascertained the manner in which hedgehogs kill snakes; they\r\nmake a sudden attack on the reptile, give it a fierce bite, and then,\r\nwith the utmost dexterity, roll themselves up so as to present nothing\r\nbut spines when the snake retaliates. They repeat this manoeuvre several\r\ntimes, till the back of the snake is broken in various places; they then\r\npass it through their jaws, cracking its bones at short intervals; after\r\nwhich they eat it all up, beginning at the tail. The old legend, that\r\nhedgehogs suck the udders of cows as they lie on the ground chewing the\r\ncud is, of course, wholly without foundation. They retreat to holes in\r\ntrees, or in the earth where they make a bed of leaves, moss, etc., in\r\nwhich they roll themselves, and these substances sticking to the spines\r\nmake them look like a bundle of vegetable matter. In this condition they\r\npass the winter, in a state of torpidity; but it should be mentioned,\r\nthat one which was tame, retained its activity the whole year. There are\r\ninstances of hedgehogs performing the office of turnspits in a kitchen;\r\nand, from the facility with which they accommodate themselves to all\r\nsorts of food, they are easily kept. They, however, when once accustomed\r\nto animal diet, will attack young game; and one was detected in the\r\nsouth of Scotland in the act of killing a leveret.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBEARS.\r\n\r\n\r\nAmong the Carnivora, or flesh-eating animals, Bears take the first\r\nplace; for their characters and habits link them in some degree with the\r\npreceding order, the Insectivora. Both principally live on fruit,\r\ngrains, and insects, and only eat flesh from necessity, or some\r\npeculiarity of life, such as confinement, or education.\r\n\r\nThe Carnivora are divided by naturalists into three tribes, the\r\ncharacters for which are taken from their feet and manner of walking.\r\nBears rank among the Plantigrada, or those which put the whole of their\r\nfeet firmly upon the ground when they walk. They are occasionally\r\ncunning and ferocious, but often evince good humour, and a great love of\r\nfun. In their wild state they are solitary the greater part of their\r\nlives; they climb trees with great facility, live in caverns, holes, and\r\nhollow trees; and in cold countries, retire to some secluded spot during\r\nthe winter, where they remain concealed, and bring forth their young.\r\nSome say they are torpid; but this cannot be, for the female bears come\r\nfrom their retreats with cubs which have lived upon them, and it is not\r\nlikely, that they can have reared them and remained without food; they\r\nare, however, often very lean and wasted, and the absorption of their\r\ngenerally large portion of fat, contributes to their nourishment. The\r\nstory that they live by sucking their paws is, as may be supposed, a\r\nfable; when well-fed they always lick their paws, very often\r\naccompanying the action with a peculiar sort of mumbling noise. There\r\nare a few which will never eat flesh, and all are able to do without it.\r\nThey are, generally speaking, large, clumsy and awkward, possessing\r\nlarge claws for digging; and often walk on their hind-feet, a facility\r\nafforded them by the peculiar formation of their thigh-bone. They do not\r\noften attack in the first instance, unless impelled by hunger or danger;\r\nthey are, however, formidable opponents when excited. In former times\r\nthere were few parts of the globe in which they were not to be found;\r\nbut like other wild animals, they have disappeared before the advance of\r\nman. Still they are found in certain spots from the northern regions of\r\nthe world, to the burning climes of Africa, Asia, and America. The\r\nlatest date of their appearance in Great Britain, was in Scotland,\r\nduring the year 1057.\r\n\r\nBears are always covered with thick fur; which, notwithstanding its\r\ncoarseness, is much prized for various purposes. They afford much sport\r\nto those inclined for such exercises; but the cruel practice of\r\nbear-baiting is discontinued. In an old edition of Hudibras, there is a\r\ncurious note of a mode of running at the devoted bears with\r\nwheelbarrows, on which they vented their fury, and the baiters thus had\r\nthem at their mercy. At present the hunts are regularly organised\r\nfights, or battles, besides which there are many ways of catching them\r\nin traps, pitfalls, etc.\r\n\r\nThe large polar bear (Ursus Maritimus), with its white fur, its long,\r\nflattened head, and black claws, may be seen in great perfection at the\r\nZoological Gardens. In its own country, during the winter, it lives\r\nchiefly on seal's flesh, but in the summer eats berries, sea-weed, and\r\nmarsh plants. It is one of the most formidable of the race; and may be\r\nseen climbing mountains of ice, and swimming from floe to floe with the\r\ngreatest rapidity. Captain Lyon tells us, that when a seal lies just\r\nashore, the bear gets quietly into the water and swims away from him to\r\nleeward; he then takes short dives, and manages so that the last dive\r\nshall bring him back close to the seal, which tries to escape by rolling\r\ninto the water, when he falls into the bear's paws; and if he should lie\r\nstill, the bear springs upon and devours him; its favourite food,\r\nhowever, is the floating carcases of whales. The gait of all bears is a\r\nsort of shuffle; but this one goes at such a rate, that its pace is\r\nequal to a horse's gallop. It is remarkably sagacious, and often defeats\r\nthe stratagems practised for its capture. A female with two cubs was\r\npursued across a field of ice by a party of sailors; at first she urged\r\nthe young ones to increase their speed, by running in front of them,\r\nturning round, and evincing, by gesture and voice, great anxiety for\r\ntheir progress; but finding that their pursuers gained upon them, she\r\nalternately carried, pushed, or pitched them forwards, until she\r\neffected their escape. The cubs seemed to arrange themselves for the\r\nthrow, and when thus sent forwards some yards in advance, ran on till\r\nshe again came up to them, when they alternately placed themselves\r\nbefore her.\r\n\r\nA she-bear and two large cubs, being attracted by the scent of some\r\nblubber, proceeding from a seahorse, which had been set on fire, and was\r\nburning on the ice, ran eagerly towards it, dragged some pieces out of\r\nthe flames, and eat them with great voracity. The sailors threw them\r\nsome lumps still left in their possession, which the old bear took away\r\nand laid before her cubs, reserving only a small piece for herself. As\r\nthey were eating the last piece, the men shot the cubs, and wounded the\r\nmother. Her distress was most painful to behold, and, though wounded,\r\nshe crawled to the spot where they lay, tore the piece of flesh into\r\npieces, and put some before each. Finding they did not eat, she tried\r\nto raise them, making piteous moans all the time. She then went to some\r\ndistance, looked back and moaned, and this failing to entice them, she\r\nreturned and licked their wounds. She did this a second time, and still\r\nfinding that the cubs did not follow, she went round and pawed them with\r\ngreat tenderness. Being at last convinced that they were lifeless, she\r\nraised her head towards the ship, and, by a growl, seemed to reproach\r\ntheir destroyers. They returned this with a volley of musket balls;[1]\r\nshe fell between her cubs, and died licking their wounds.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE BEAR AND HER CUBS.--Page 54.]\r\n\r\nThe black bear of Canada is a formidable creature, and Dr. Richardson\r\ncontradicts the assertion that it is not swift of foot; he says that it\r\nsoon outstrips the swiftest runner, and adds, that it climbs as well, if\r\nnot better than a cat. It feeds on berries, eggs, and roots; but\r\nalthough it does not seek flesh, it does not refuse it when offered. A\r\nyoung bear of this kind roughly handled a Canadian settler, who, being a\r\nvery large powerful man, returned hug for hug, till the surprised bear\r\nlet go its hold. It had ventured into some young plantations, where it\r\nwas committing much mischief, and the settler had endeavoured to\r\nfrighten it away. A friend of mine was in the house when the gentleman\r\nreturned home, his clothes torn in the struggle, and very much exhausted\r\nby the encounter; he dropped into a chair, and nearly fainted, but a\r\nlittle brandy revived him, though he was ill some days from the\r\npressure.\r\n\r\nA young English officer, who was stationed at a lone fortress in the\r\nsame country, amused himself by taming a bear of the above species. He\r\ntaught him to fetch and carry, to follow him like a dog, and to wait\r\npatiently at meal time for his share. He took the bear with him when he\r\nreturned to England, and he became a great favourite with the passengers\r\nand the ship's company. Bruin, however, especially attached himself to a\r\nlittle girl, about four years old, the daughter of one of the ladies on\r\nboard, who romped with him as she would with a dog. In one of these\r\ngames of play, he seized her with one fore paw, and with the other\r\nclambered and clung to the rigging, till he lodged her and himself in\r\nthe main top, where, regardless of her cries and the agony of her\r\nmother, he tried to continue his romp. It would not do to pursue the\r\npair, for fear the bear should drop the child; and his master, knowing\r\nhow fond he was of sugar, had some mattresses placed round the mast, in\r\ncase the child should fall, and then strewed a quantity of the sugar on\r\nthe deck; he called Bruin, and pointed to it, who, after a moment's\r\nhesitation, came down as he went up, bringing the child in safety. He\r\nwas, of course, deprived of his liberty during the rest of his voyage.\r\n\r\nThis same black bear of Canada, after it has hugged its antagonists to\r\ndeath, tears them open with its hind feet. It will ward off blows like\r\nan accomplished boxer; for, as it would be of no use to strike him on\r\nhis thickly-covered body, the attacks are usually made about the head. A\r\nman who wantonly threw an axe at a male bear as he passed, wounded him,\r\nwhereupon the beast rushed at him, the man fell backwards over a fallen\r\ntree, and, in so doing, tore off a sharp-pointed knob of wood, which he\r\nthrust down the bear's throat, and so killed him; not, however, before\r\nhe had received his own death wound from the hind foot. He walked home\r\nholding in his intestines, and died a day or two after.[2]\r\n\r\nAn old hunter, named Ruhe, having set his traps to catch beavers,\r\nreturned to the stream to ascertain his success; he missed one of them,\r\nand, on looking for it, saw signs of a bear having passed that way. As\r\nhe went on, he heard the noise of a heavy body breaking through the\r\nbushes in the thicket. He hid himself behind a rock, and saw a huge\r\nbear, limping on three legs to a flat piece of rock, upon which it\r\nseated itself, and on raising one of its fore paws Ruhe discovered that\r\nit was encircled by the lost trap. The bear lifted the iron glove\r\ntowards his face, examined it, turned his paw round and round, bent his\r\nhead from side to side, looked at the trap askance with the most\r\npuzzled air, felt the encumbrance, tapped it on the rock, and evidently\r\nknew not what to do. Then he began to feel pain and licked it; but Ruhe\r\nsoon put an end to all his conjectures, by shooting him dead.[3]\r\n\r\nOf all bears, the grizzly is said to be the most formidable, both for\r\nsize and ferocity, and Mr. Ruxton tells the following anecdote, in which\r\none of them makes a conspicuous figure:--\"A trapper, named Glass, and a\r\ncompanion, were setting their beaver traps in a stream to the north of\r\nthe river Platte, when they saw a large, grizzly bear turning up the\r\nturf near by, and searching for roots and pig-nuts. The two men crept to\r\nthe thicket, and fired at him; they wounded, but did not kill him; the\r\nbeast groaned, jumped all four legs from the ground, and, snorting with\r\npain and fury, charged towards the place from whence came the smoke of\r\nthe rifles. The men rushed through the thicket, where the underwood\r\nalmost impeded their progress; but the beast's weight and strength\r\ncarried him along so fast, that he soon came up with them. A steep bluff\r\nwas situated a hundred yards off, with a level plain of grass between it\r\nand the thicket; the hunters flew across the latter with the utmost\r\nspeed, the bear after them. When he reached about halfway, Glass\r\nstumbled over a stone and fell. He rose, and the bear stood before him\r\non his hind legs. Glass called to his companion to fire, and he himself\r\nsent the contents of his pistol into the bear's body. The furious\r\nanimal, with the blood streaming from his nose and mouth, knocked the\r\npistol away with one paw, while he stuck the claws of the other into the\r\nflesh of his antagonist, and rolled with him on the ground. Glass\r\nmanaged to reach his knife, and plunged it several times into the bear,\r\nwhile the latter, with tooth and claw, tore his flesh. At last, blinded\r\nwith blood and exhaustion, the knife fell from the trapper's hand, and\r\nhe became insensible. His companion, who thought his turn would come\r\nnext, did not even think of reloading his rifle, and fled to the camp,\r\nwhere others of his party were resting, to tell the miserable fate of\r\ntheir companion. Assistance was sent, and Glass still breathed, but the\r\nbear lay across him quite dead, from three bullets and twenty knife\r\nwounds; the man's flesh was torn away in slips, and lumps of it lay upon\r\nthe ground; his scalp hung bleeding over his face, which was also torn.\r\nThe men took away the trapper's hunting-shirt, moccasins, and arms,\r\ndragged the bear off his body, and left him, declaring, when they\r\nrejoined their party, that they had completed his burial.\"\r\n\r\nAlthough the bear no longer figures in the story, I must be allowed to\r\nrelate the sequel, as a proof of what human nature can endure without\r\ndestruction. Months elapsed, and some of the party of the above\r\nmentioned camp were on their way to a trading port with their skins,\r\nwhen they saw a horseman approach them, with a face so scarred and\r\ndisfigured that they could not distinguish his features.\r\n\r\nThe stranger accosted that one of the party who had been Glass's\r\ncompanion, exclaiming, in a hollow voice, \"Hurrah, Bill, my boy, you\r\nthought I was gone under (killed) that time, did you? but hand me over\r\nmy horse and gun, lad. I'm not dead yet.\" Astonishment and horror seized\r\non the party, many of whom believed he had been buried as well as dead.\r\nHowever, there could be no mistake now, and when they had sufficiently\r\nrecovered from their surprise to listen to Glass's story, he told them\r\nthat he knew not how long he lay before he recovered his senses; but\r\nwhen he did, and was able to take nourishment, he was obliged to subsist\r\non the flesh of the bear. When he had strength to crawl, he tore off as\r\nmuch of this as he could carry in his weak state, and crept down to the\r\nriver; he had suffered tortures from cold, wounds, and hunger, but he\r\nhad reached the fort, which was between eighty and ninety miles distant,\r\nliving the greater part of the way on roots and berries, but there he\r\nhad been taken care of and recovered.\r\n\r\nThe brown bear much resembles the black in size, habits and shape, and\r\nlike it, lives in hollow places; he, however, sometimes digs pits for\r\nhimself, and even constructs huts, which he lines with moss. Both\r\nattain an enormous size and weight. All bears are extremely fond of\r\nhoney and sugar, and are often taken when venturing too close to man to\r\nprocure these enticing substances. The settlers in Canada, when they\r\nmake maple sugar, catch them by leaving a boiler full, into which they\r\ndip their paws, or their head, and they fall an easy prey when\r\nencumbered with the thick, saccharine matter, and sometimes with the\r\nboiler also. Bruin's attention is easily diverted, and many have escaped\r\nby throwing a bundle or knapsack down when he is in pursuit of them, for\r\nwhile he stoops to examine it, they gain time and distance. It is\r\nnatural to him to play all sorts of antics; and we are told by an Indian\r\ntraveller, that in one of his journeys, some bears kept in front of his\r\npalanquin, tumbling and playing as if they designed to afford him\r\namusement. Climbing is a great delight to them, and one was seen to\r\nascend a scaffolding, for his own pleasure; he at first proceeded\r\ncautiously, examining the strength of all the joists, and at last\r\nreached the summit, which was one hundred and twenty feet high. He\r\nlooked much pleased when he had completed this operation, and the\r\nworkmen treated him with great civility. They were going to lower him in\r\na bucket, but to this he would not consent, and descended as he had\r\nmounted, being so pleased with his prowess, that he repeated his visit.\r\n\r\nA Norwegian had tamed a bear so completely, that he used to stand at the\r\nback of his master's sledge, where he kept so good a balance, that it\r\nwas impossible to upset him: if the sledge went on one side, the bear\r\nthrew his weight in the opposite direction, and so kept up the\r\nequilibrium. One day, however, his master, in sport, drove over the\r\nworst ground he could find, hoping to throw the bear off. This, however,\r\nonly served to irritate him; and he vented his ill humour by giving his\r\nmaster a tremendous blow across the shoulders.\r\n\r\nA countryman, in Russia, when seeking honey, climbed a very high tree;\r\nthe trunk of which was hollow, and finding there was a large quantity of\r\ncomb in it, he descended, and stuck fast in the tenacious substance\r\nthere deposited. He was so far distant from home, that his voice could\r\nnot be heard, and he remained two days in this situation, relieving his\r\nhunger with the honey. He began to despair of ever being extricated,\r\nwhen a bear who, like himself, came for the sake of the honey, slid down\r\nthe hollow, hind part foremost. The man, in spite of his alarm, seized\r\nhold of him, and the bear, also in a great fright, clambered out as fast\r\nas he could, dragging the man up with him, and when clear of his\r\ntail-bearer, made off as fast as possible.\r\n\r\nThe drollest and most accomplished of all bears, was the celebrated\r\nMartin, of Paris, whose dancing, climbing, curtsying, tumbling,\r\nbegging, and many other antics, were the delight of every child in the\r\nmetropolis, and of many grown-up children also. It is true, that the\r\nnursemaids endangered the lives of their charges, by holding them over\r\nthe side of the pit in which he was kept; but as none _did_ fall, they\r\ncontinued to amuse themselves and their nurslings at the same risk. One\r\nmorning early, he very cleverly withdrew the bolts of his pit door, and\r\nsallied forth on his hind-legs to take a walk. The keepers of the garden\r\nhad not risen; but the dogs were on the alert, and surrounded Martin,\r\njumping and barking, half in play, and half in earnest. This roused the\r\nmen, who, rushing out to see what was the matter, beheld the bear in the\r\nmidst of the canine troop, his tongue lolling out of his mouth, and an\r\nexpression of fun and enjoyment in his countenance, which was\r\nindescribable. Never was the malignant scowl, so often noticed in bears,\r\nfrom pulling the nictating membrane, or third eyelid half over the\r\neye, seen in poor Martin's face; yet he became unpopular from the\r\ncupidity of one of the sentinels. This man fancied he saw a five-franc\r\npiece lying in the bear's pit, and determined to go during the night,\r\nwhen he would be on duty, and secure it. He accordingly provided himself\r\nwith a ladder, and when the guard was changed, was found lying lifeless\r\nat the bottom, the coveted piece in his hand, which proved to be nothing\r\nbut a large button. No marks of violence were to be seen upon his body,\r\nbut the contusions on his head seemed to tell that he had fallen from\r\nthe ladder when near the top, and so met his death. Whether he had been\r\nfrightened, or seized with giddiness, or whether Martin had shaken the\r\nladder, no one could say; the animal was sitting quietly by his side\r\nwhen his fate was first made known. The story fled like wildfire from\r\none end of Paris to the other, and in a short time, the populace were\r\nfully convinced that Martin had killed him; and this, combined with\r\nother exaggerations, induced them to flock in multitudes to see the\r\nmurderous bear. Afterwards, two balls of arsenic, wrapped up in some\r\nsweet substance, were found in the pit, fortunately before Martin had\r\ntouched them; and the authorities of the establishment thought it\r\nprudent to remove him to a den in the menagerie. The front of these dens\r\nwas closed at night with a sliding shutter, pulled down by inserting a\r\nhook at the end of a long pole into a ring, which ring, when the shutter\r\nwas down, served to admit a bolt. This did not at all please Martin, and\r\nthe keeper never could accomplish the fastening, till some one else went\r\nto the other side to take off the bear's attention; for the moment the\r\nshutter was down, Martin inserted his claws and pushed it up again, and\r\nthis practice was continued as long as he existed.\r\n\r\nThe Malayan Sun bear (Ursus Malayensis) has a long tongue, short smooth\r\nfur, very extensible, flexible lips, and large claws. Sir Stamford\r\nRaffles had one which was brought up in the nursery with his children,\r\nand when he joined the party at table, would only eat the choicest\r\nfruit, and drink champagne, and even be out of humour when there was\r\nnone of the latter. He was very affectionate, and never required to be\r\nchained or chastised. This bear, a cat, a dog, and a lory from New\r\nHolland, used to eat amicably out of the same dish. His favorite\r\nplayfellow, however, was the dog, although he was teased and worried by\r\nit incessantly. He grew to be very powerful, and pulled plants and trees\r\nup by the roots, the latter of which were too large for him to embrace.\r\n\r\nThe Bornean bear (Ursus Euryspilus) is one of the most amusing and\r\nplayful of all bears; begs in the most earnest manner, and when it has\r\nmore to eat than it can hold in its paws and mouth, places the surplus\r\non its hinder feet, as if to keep it from being soiled; and when vexed\r\nor irritated, will never be reconciled as long as the offender is in its\r\nsight. It does much injury to cocoa-nut trees, by biting off the top\r\nshoots, or tearing down the fruit.\r\n\r\n[1] Captain Phipps' Voyage to the North Pole.\r\n\r\n[2] L'Acadie.\r\n\r\n[3] Ruxton.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBADGERS.\r\n\r\n\r\nBadgers belong to the same division of Carnivora as Bears, but differ\r\nfrom them, not only in size, but in dentition. This, while they claim a\r\nsort of miniature relationship, forms them into a separate genus. They\r\nafford many a day of what is called sport, to those who choose to hunt\r\nthem, during which they evince much sagacity in their efforts to escape;\r\nbut I am happy to say the custom of tying them into an empty cask, and\r\nbaiting them with dogs, no longer exists. They are by nature slothful\r\nand heavy, but are easily tamed, and when roused are fierce. They have a\r\ngland under the tail, which secretes a liquid of most disagreeable\r\nodour, and causes them to pass into a sort of proverb. They feed chiefly\r\non roots, nuts, and other fruits; attack the nests of wasps, or wild\r\nbees, and devour their larvae, themselves, or their honey, with a perfect\r\nindifference to their stings, which cannot pierce through their tough\r\nhide. They prey at night and live in the thickest parts of woods or\r\ncoppices, where they rapidly dig deep holes, by means of their sharp and\r\npowerful claws. These holes are divided into several chambers, the\r\ninnermost of which is round, and lined with hay or grass. All are kept\r\nvery clean, and every waste remnant of food and species of filth is\r\ndeposited in holes dug on purpose for its reception. The passages to\r\nthe dwellings frequently turn at sharp angles, at which places the\r\nbadgers make a stand when attacked. Mr. St. John caused a badger's hole\r\nto be dug out, and he there found balls of grass, rolled up to the size\r\nof a man's fist, evidently intended for food. That gentleman also says,\r\nthat he has frequently found the bulb of the common blue hyacinth lying\r\nnear the hole. They devour, besides all sorts of vegetables, small\r\nanimals whether alive or dead, snails and worms; but their peculiar\r\ndainty consists of eggs. A partridge's nest affords them a delicious\r\nfeast, particularly if they include the sitting hen.\r\n\r\nBadgers have a peculiarly formed chest and jaw, which give them great\r\nstrength; their forehead is so thick, in consequence of a ridge which\r\nruns down the middle of it, that they are unhurt by a blow in front\r\nwhich would kill an ox; while almost a touch at the back of the head\r\nwill cause their destruction. Their thick skin, which lies loosely upon\r\nthem, is much used for making pistol cases, and their fur is excellent\r\nfor painter's brushes. They are difficult to kill, and few dogs have\r\ncourage enough to attack them in their holes, where they live in pairs.\r\nWhen thus pursued, they constantly impede the progress of their enemies\r\nby throwing the soil behind them, so as to fill up the passages, while\r\nthey escape to the surface. They are rare animals, but are to be found\r\nin various parts of the world. The Chinese eat them in spite of their\r\nbad odour. When tamed they show great affection, an interesting proof of\r\nwhich is given by Captain Brown in his popular Natural History, which I\r\ntranscribe. \"Two persons (in France) went on a journey, and passing\r\nthrough a hollow way, a dog which was with them, started a badger, which\r\nhe attacked, and pursued till he took shelter in a burrow under a tree.\r\nWith some pains he was hunted out and killed. Being a few miles from a\r\nvillage, called Chapelletiere, they agreed to drag him thither, as the\r\ncommune gave a reward for every one which was destroyed; besides which\r\nthey proposed selling the skin. Not having a rope, they twisted some\r\ntwigs, and by turns drew him along the road. They had not proceeded far\r\nwhen they heard the cry of an animal in seeming distress, and stopped to\r\nlisten, when another badger approached them slowly. They at first threw\r\nstones at it; notwithstanding which, it drew near, came up to the dead\r\nanimal, began to lick it, and continued its mournful cry. The men,\r\nsurprised at this, desisted from offering any further injury to it, and\r\nagain drew the dead one along as before; when the living badger,\r\ndetermined not to quit its companion, lay down on it, taking it gently\r\nby one ear, and in that manner was drawn into the midst of the village;\r\nnor could dogs, boys, or men induce it to quit its situation, and to\r\ntheir shame be it said, they had the inhumanity to kill the poor animal,\r\nand afterwards to burn it, declaring it could not be no other than a\r\nwitch.\"\r\n\r\nProfessor Bell had a badger which followed him like a dog, and which had\r\nbeen tamed when quite young by some cottager's children, with whom he\r\nplayed like a puppy. As he grew in years, he became too rough for them,\r\nbut at Mr. Bell's was a universal favourite. He yelped with a peculiar,\r\nsharp cry when excluded from his master's presence. He was fed at\r\ndinner-time, and took the morsels in the most orderly manner. He was\r\nvery affectionate, good-tempered, and cleanly. He died of a disease\r\nwhich affects many carnivorous animals in confinement--a contraction of\r\nthe lower opening of the stomach, which prevents the food from passing.\r\n\r\nIn that most interesting book, written by Mr. St. John, and called \"Wild\r\nSports of the Highlands,\" the author treats at some length of the\r\nbadger. I select the following passages from his pages:--\r\n\r\n\"I was just then startled from my reverie by a kind of grunt close to\r\nme, and the apparition of a small, waddling, grey animal, who was busily\r\nemployed in hunting about the grass and stones at the edge of the loch;\r\npresently another and another appeared in a little grassy glade which\r\nran down to the water's edge, till at last I saw seven of them busily at\r\nwork within a few yards of me, all coming from one direction. It at\r\nfirst struck me that they were some farmer's pigs taking a distant\r\nramble; but I shortly saw they were badgers, come from their fastnesses\r\nrather earlier than usual, tempted by the quiet evening, and by a heavy\r\nsummer shower that was just over, and which had brought out an infinity\r\nof large black snails and worms, on which the badgers were feeding with\r\ngood appetite. As I was dressed in grey, and sitting on a grey rock,\r\nthey did not see me, but waddled about, sometimes close to me, only now\r\nand then, as they crossed my track, they showed a slight uneasiness,\r\nsmelling the ground, and grunting gently. Presently a very large one,\r\nwhich I took to be the mother of the rest, stood motionless for a\r\nmoment, listening with great attention, and then giving a loud grunt,\r\nwhich seemed perfectly understood by the others; she scuttled away,\r\nfollowed by the whole lot. I was soon joined by my attendant, whose\r\napproach they had heard long before my less acute ears gave me warning\r\nof his coming.... When caught in traps, they [badgers] never leave part\r\nof their foot behind them and so escape, as foxes and other vermin\r\nfrequently do; but they display very great strength and dexterity in\r\ndrawing up the peg of the trap, and this done, they will carry off the\r\nheaviest trap to an amazing distance, over rock or heather. They never\r\nattempt to enter their hole with a trap dangling to their foot, but\r\ngenerally lay up in some furze bush or thicket.\r\n\r\n\"When first caught, their efforts to escape show a degree of strength\r\nand ingenuity which is quite wonderful, digging and tearing at their\r\nprison with the strength of a rhinoceros. I one day found a badger, not\r\nmuch hurt, in a trap. Tying a rope to his hind leg, I drove him home\r\nbefore me, as a man drives a pig, but with much less trouble, for he\r\nmade no attempts to escape, but trotted quietly ahead, only occasionally\r\nshowing a natural inclination to bolt off the main path, whenever he\r\npassed any diverging road, all of which were probably familiar haunts of\r\nthe unlucky beast. When at home, I put him into a paved court, where I\r\nthought he could not possibly escape. The next morning, however, he was\r\ngone, having displaced a stone that I thought him quite incapable of\r\nmoving, and then digging under a wall.... Sometimes I have known a\r\nbadger leave the solitude of the woods and take to some drain in the\r\ncultivated country, where he becomes very bold and destructive to the\r\ncrops, cutting down wheat, and ravaging the gardens in a most surprising\r\nmanner. One which I know to be now living in this manner, derives great\r\npart of his food during the spring from a rookery, under which he\r\nnightly hunts, feeding on the young rooks that fall from their nests, or\r\non the old ones that are shot. This badger eludes every attempt to trap\r\nhim. Having more than once run narrow risks of this nature, he has\r\nbecome so cunning, that no one can catch him. If a dozen baited traps\r\nare set, he manages to carry off the baits, and spring every trap,\r\nalways with total impunity to himself. At one time he was watched out to\r\nsome distance from his drain, and traps were then put in all directions\r\nround it, but, by jumping over some and rolling over others, he escaped\r\nall. In fact, though a despised and maltreated animal, when he has once\r\nacquired a certain experience in worldly matters, few beasts show more\r\naddress and cunning in keeping out of scrapes. Though eaten in France,\r\nGermany, and other countries, and pronounced to make excellent hams, we\r\nin Britain despise him as food, though I see no reason why he should not\r\nbe quite as good as any pork.\r\n\r\n\"The badger becomes immensely fat. Though not a great eater, his quiet\r\nhabits and his being a great sleeper prevent his being lean.\" That sleep\r\nis taken in the day, for his habits are generally nocturnal.\r\n\r\nAll badgers may be recognized by the broad black band across their\r\ncheeks. Those of India have longer legs than those of Europe; their\r\nsnout is also prolonged, like that of a hog; and their tail resembles\r\nthat of the latter animal. They are very slow in their movement, and\r\nwhen affronted make a peculiar grunting noise, and bristle up the hair\r\nof their back. If still more roused, they stand on their hind legs as\r\nbears do, have much power in their fore legs, and are extremely savage\r\nwhen provoked.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWEASELS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe second tribe of Carnivora walks upon its toes, and is, consequently,\r\ncalled Digitigrada; it is chiefly composed of a number of smaller\r\nanimals, which are very interesting from many of their habits, very\r\nprecious from the valuable fur which they afford, and in many instances\r\nare so destructive, that they go under the common name of Vermin. A\r\nnumerous genus bears the appellation of Vermiform, because their bodies\r\nare long, and their legs are short, which formation enables them to\r\nslide through small apertures in worm-fashion, twisting themselves\r\nthrough the winding passages, with their bodies touching the ground.\r\nThey destroy much game, and, except when trained to kill rats and\r\nrabbits, are objects of persecution and dislike. Among them are weasels,\r\npolecats, ferrets, martens, skunks, and others. The ermine and sable are\r\nincluded with the martens; and the three first send forth a disagreeable\r\nodour. They, however, are not to be compared in this respect to the\r\nskunk, which of all creatures is one of the most disagreeable, in\r\nconsequence of its foetid gland, which secretes the offensive liquor\r\nsent forth when the animal is frightened or irritated. Nothing will\r\nobliterate this odour, no other scent overcomes it; no burying in the\r\nearth, no washing will avail; even time does not cure, and an article of\r\ndress put by for years, is still unwearable.\r\n\r\nIt is to weasels and otters that I shall confine myself in this work,\r\nfor about their intellectual powers do we know most. The first is a very\r\ncourageous beast, not fearing to attack animals much larger than\r\nhimself--even man. A labouring peasant at Glencairn, in Dumfrieshire,\r\nwas attacked by six of them, who rushed upon him when he was at work in\r\na field. Being frightened at such a furious onset, he fled, but they\r\npursued him, although he dealt some back-handed strokes with a large\r\nhorsewhip. He was on the point of being seized by the throat, when he\r\nfortunately perceived the fallen branch of a tree. He snatched it up,\r\nand making a stand against his enemies, he killed three, and put the\r\nothers to flight. Another instance is reported by Captain Brown, in his\r\nPopular Natural history, where the affray commenced by a person striking\r\na weasel, which squeaked aloud. This roused a whole colony, consisting\r\nof fifteen, who flew at him and bit him severely. A gentleman came to\r\nhis aid, and with his assistance, several of the assailants were killed,\r\nthe others ran into the fissures of a neighbouring rock.\r\n\r\nThere are instances of weasels having been tamed; but it is very\r\ndifficult to make any impression on their affections, although they are\r\nvery sagacious, and sagacious animals are more easily influenced than\r\nothers. The weasel and the stoat are so often mistaken for each other,\r\nthat it will be well to point out the constant difference in each. The\r\nstoat is brown above, dirty white underneath; his tail is longer and\r\nmore bushy than that of the weasel, and always black at the tip. The\r\nweasel is red above, and pure white underneath, and the tail is red and\r\nuniform, being deprived of the bushy tip. Mr. Bell, from whose pages I\r\nhave taken these characters, defends weasels from the accusation of\r\ndevouring poultry, game, hares, rabbits, and various small birds. He\r\nsays, that when driven by hunger, they may occasionally eat such things;\r\nbut that their general food consists of mice and rats of every\r\ndescription, the field and water vole, and moles; and that they ought\r\nrather to be encouraged than exterminated, because they destroy so much\r\nvermin. They generally approach with the utmost caution and shyness, and\r\nwhen once they have seized their prey, they never let go their hold;\r\nthey aim at the neck, below the ear, or drive their teeth through the\r\nback of the head: they hound and spring, and climb trees with the\r\ngreatest facility, and seem never to tire of hunting, whether they are\r\nhungry or not. Mr. St. John saw one in a stubble field, in which\r\nseveral corn buntings were flying about, or alighting on a thistle. The\r\nanimal disappeared at the foot of this thistle, and the above gentleman\r\nthought he had slunk into a hole, but feeling sure by his manner he\r\nintended some mischief, he stayed to watch his movements. As soon as one\r\nof the birds settled on the thistle, something sprang up as quick as\r\nlightning, and then disappeared with the bird; it was the weasel, who\r\nhad thus successfully concealed himself. The same gentleman chased a\r\nweasel into a hollow tree, who carried something in her mouth. He\r\napplied smoke to the hole, and out she came again, carrying the same\r\nburden. She ran towards a stone-wall, but was met by a terrier, who\r\nkilled her, catching her with the greater facility in consequence of her\r\nobstinacy in carrying away what Mr. St. John still thought was her prey.\r\nOn picking it up, however, he found that it was a young weasel, unable\r\nto run, which its mother was endeavouring to carry to a place of safety,\r\nher former hole in an adjoining field having been ploughed over. Another\r\nproof of the weasel's affection for her young, was witnessed by a\r\nlabourer, who, while standing on a foot-path close to the hedge side,\r\nperceived a weasel with one of her young ones in her mouth. He kicked\r\nher, and she, dropping it, retreated into a hedge. He then stood over\r\nthe young one with a stick in his hand, not intending to kill it, but\r\nmerely to see how its mother would proceed. She soon peeped from her\r\ncovert, and made several feints to get at her charge, but was obliged to\r\nrun into the hedge again, intimidated by the stick which the man\r\nflourished about. At last she summoned up all her resolution, and in\r\nspite of everything, after a great deal of dodging to avoid the stick,\r\nsucceeded in obtaining the object of her solicitude, and bore it off\r\nbetween the legs of her tormentor.\r\n\r\nWeasels sometimes fall a prey to hawks; and I transcribe the following\r\naccount from the pages of Mr. Bell. \"As a gentleman of the name of\r\nPinder, was riding over his grounds, he saw, at a short distance from\r\nhim, a kite pounce on some object on the ground, and rise with it in his\r\ntalons. In a few moments, however, the kite began to show signs of great\r\nuneasiness, rising rapidly in the air, or as quickly falling, and\r\nwheeling irregularly round, whilst he was evidently endeavouring to free\r\nsome obnoxious thing from him with his feet. After a short but sharp\r\ncontest, the kite fell suddenly to the earth, not far from Mr. Pinder.\r\nHe instantly rode up to the spot, when a weasel ran away from the kite,\r\napparently unhurt, leaving the bird dead, with a hole eaten through the\r\nskin under the wing, and the large blood vessels of the part torn\r\nthrough.\"\r\n\r\nThe nest composed by weasels, in which they will bring forth four or\r\nfive young ones, two or three times a year, is of dry leaves and\r\nherbage, is placed in a hole, in a bank, a dry ditch, or a hollow tree,\r\nand if a dog come near it, the mother flies at him, and fastens on his\r\nlips with great tenacity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOTTERS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe much persecuted otter presents himself to our notice among the\r\nworm-bodied, digitigrade animals. Their broad webbed feet shew that they\r\nfrequent the water, and in fact, they are not only found in rivers and\r\nlakes of most European countries, but at sea. Their elongated body is\r\nflattened horizontally, their tail is broad and flat, and forms an\r\nexcellent rudder for their guidance when in the water. Their short legs\r\nare so loosely jointed that they can be turned in any direction when\r\nswimming, and their fur is soft, fine, and close underneath, while a\r\nlonger, coarser set of hard shining hairs, are on the outside. Their\r\nteeth are very pointed, and well adapted to hold their slippery prey;\r\ntheir ears are very small, and close to their head, and they have a\r\nnictating membrane, or third eyelid, for the protection of their bright\r\neyes. Their movements in the water are particularly elegant, they swim\r\nhorizontally, and rapidly dive after their victims, which they eat\r\nashore. It is said, that they will collect a number of trouts into a\r\nshoal, and drive them on till, in their dread and alarm, many of the\r\nfishes will throw themselves on to the land. They have the power of\r\nremaining very long under water, at a considerable depth, and the fierce\r\nmanner in which they keep dogs at bay, often wounding them severely with\r\ntheir sharp bites; and the anxious watching for their rise in the water\r\nwhen they have retreated, all form a most exciting sport, so that we\r\nhear of otter-hunting as a source of keen enjoyment; and there is a hunt\r\non record in which nine otters were killed in one day.\r\n\r\nOtters will certainly consume an immense quantity of fish; and the\r\nowners of salmon or trout streams have great spite against them. It is,\r\nhowever, very possible to tame them so as to make them bring the fish\r\nwhich they catch. This practice is much more followed in other countries\r\nthan in England; they are purposely kept for it in Sweden, and at a\r\nsignal from the cook will go and fetch the fish for dinner. Bishop Heber\r\nmentions, that he saw several large and very beautiful otters fastened\r\nto bamboo stakes by the side of the Matta Colly river, some of which\r\nappeared to be at play, and uttered a shrill, whistling noise. They wore\r\nstraw collars and were very tame and docile. They should be caught quite\r\nyoung, and fed on small fish, then they are allowed bread and milk at\r\nalternate meals; till at last they entirely live upon this food. They\r\nare taught to fetch and carry with artificial fishes made of leather,\r\nand stuffed with wool. Then they are made to bring dead fishes, and if\r\nthey attempt to tear them, they are severely punished. Thus trained, in\r\nprocess of time, the otter becomes useful and domesticated.\r\n\r\nIn their natural condition, otters will wander to considerable distances\r\nfor their prey; Mr. St. John says, \"I was rather amused at an old woman\r\nliving at Sluie on the Findhorn, who, complaining of the hardness of the\r\npresent times, when 'a puir body couldn'a get a drop smuggled whisky, or\r\nshoot a roe without his lordship's sportsman finding it out,' added to\r\nher list of grievances, that even the otters were nearly all gone 'puir\r\nbeasties.' 'Well, but what good could the otters do you?' I asked her.\r\n'Good, your honor? why scarcely a morn came but they left a bonny grilse\r\n(young salmon) on the scarp down yonder, and the vennison was none the\r\nworse of the bit the puir beasts ate themselves,' The people here\r\n(Morayshire) call every eatable animal, fish, flesh, or fowl, venison,\r\nor as they pronounce it, vennison. For instance, they tell you that the\r\nsnipes are good vennison, or that the trout are not good vennison in the\r\nwinter.\r\n\r\n\"It seems that a few years ago, before the otters had been so much\r\ndestroyed, the people in particular parts of the river were never at a\r\nloss for salmon, as the otters always took them ashore, generally to\r\nthe same bank or rock, and in seasons of plenty, they only eat a small\r\npiece out of the shoulder, leaving the rest untouched, and the\r\ncottagers, aware of this, searched every morning for their leavings.\"\r\n\r\n\"Otters,\" continues Mr. St. John, \"are very affectionate animals; the\r\nyoung anxiously seek their mother, if she should be killed; and if the\r\nyoung are injured, the parent hovers near them till she is herself\r\ndestroyed. If one of a pair be killed, the one that is left will hunt\r\nfor its mate with untiring perseverance; and if one be caught in a trap,\r\nits companion will run round and round, endeavouring to set it free, on\r\nwhich occasions, though so quiet at other times, they make a snorting\r\nand blowing like a horse.\"\r\n\r\nA dog belonging to the above gentleman was running and splashing through\r\nthe shallow water, and suddenly stood still, sometimes whining, as if\r\ncaught in a trap, and then biting furiously at something in the water.\r\nHe was called by his master, but as he did not obey, his master waded to\r\nhim, and found a large otter, holding on by his powerful jaws to the\r\ndog's shoulder; and had he not had a good covering of curly hair, he\r\nstood a chance of having his leg broken, the bite was so severe.\r\n\r\nThe people in Scotland believe that the otters have a king, or leader,\r\nwhich is larger than others, and spotted with white. They also believe\r\nthat when these animals are killed, a man or another of the brute kind\r\ndies suddenly at the same moment; that their skin possesses an antidote\r\nto infection, preserves soldiers from wounds, and saves sailors from\r\ndisasters at sea. The darkness in which otters delight, their watery\r\nhabitations, their oily, noiseless movements, and their dark fur, invest\r\nthem with mystery in the eyes of the peasantry in many parts of England.\r\n\r\nThe emigration of otters is established by the following fact:--\"A\r\nlabourer going to his work, soon after five o'clock in the morning, saw\r\na number of animals coming towards him, and stood quietly by the hedge\r\ntill they came alongside of him. He then perceived four old otters,\r\nprobably dams, and about twenty young ones. He took a stick out of the\r\nhedge and killed one. Directly it began to squeak, all the four old ones\r\nturned back, and stood till the other young ones had escaped through the\r\nhedge, and then went quietly themselves. Several families were thus\r\njourneying together, and probably they had left their former abode from\r\nnot finding a sufficiency of food.\"\r\n\r\nThe beautiful otter in the Museum of the Zoological Gardens is from\r\nIreland, and is by some considered as a distinct species. It is chiefly\r\nfound on the coast of Antrim, living in the caverns formed by the\r\nbasaltic columns of that shore, and, as it hunts the salmon, rewards are\r\noffered for its destruction.\r\n\r\nThe flesh of all otters is extremely rank and fishy; and because it\r\ncannot be called meat, it is often allowed to be eaten on the meager\r\ndays appointed by the Romish Church.\r\n\r\nCaptain Brown, in his Popular Natural History, tells us of a person who\r\nkept a tame otter with his dogs, which followed him in company with\r\nthem. He hunted fish with them, and they never would hunt any other\r\notter as long as he was with them.\r\n\r\nThere was a tame otter in Northumberland, which also followed his master\r\nwherever he went. He caught his own food, and returned home when\r\nsatisfied. Once he refused to come to the usual call when he was out,\r\nand was lost for some days. At length, going back to the same place, he,\r\nwith great joy, came creeping to his master's feet, who was still\r\nseeking his favourite.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDOGS.\r\n\r\n\r\nBaron Cuvier says that the most useful conquest achieved by man, is the\r\ndomestication of the dog--a conquest so long completed, that it is now\r\nimpossible, with any certainty, to trace these animals to their original\r\ntype. The cleverest of naturalists have supposed them to descend from\r\nwolves, from jackals, or from a mixture of the two; while others,\r\nequally clever, assert that they proceeded from different species of\r\ndogs. The latter maintain that the Dingos of Australia, the Buansas of\r\nNepal, or Dholes of India, the Aguaras of South America, and several\r\nother races, are original; and although they may not have produced the\r\ndogs which attend man, they prove that we may attribute the latter to\r\npredecessors of the same kind, without having recourse to other animals\r\nwhich they more or less resemble. On the other hand again, some of our\r\nfirst men are of opinion that there are now no original dogs, but that\r\nall the packs called wild are those which have made their escape from a\r\nstate of domesticity. This is not the place to examine the merits of the\r\ndifferent proofs brought in favor of each argument; and I hasten to a\r\nbrief notice of some of those which subsist independently of human\r\nassistance.\r\n\r\nAll dogs, wild or tame, walk upon their toes with a firm, elastic gait,\r\nand their toes are not retractile. Their other external characters are\r\nso varied, that it is impossible to give a general summary of their\r\ncolour or form; the largest on record (a Suliot, belonging to the king\r\nof Naples), measured four feet at the shoulders; the least would\r\nprobably give a height of as many inches. All the untamed species are\r\nlank and gaunt, their muzzles are long and slender, their eyes oblique,\r\nand their strength and tenacity of life are almost marvellous.\r\n\r\nThe Dingo, or Australian dog, roams in packs through that vast country;\r\nhas a broad head, fierce, oblique eyes, acute muzzle; short, pointed,\r\nerect ears; tail bushy, and never raised to more than a horizontal\r\nposition. He does not bark, but howls fearfully; is extremely sagacious,\r\nand has a remarkable power of bearing pain. When beaten so severely as\r\nto be left for dead, he has been seen to get up and run away. A man\r\nproceeded to skin one, not doubting that life was extinct, and after\r\nproceeding a little way with the operation, he left the hut to sharpen\r\nhis knife. When he returned, the poor animal was sitting up, with the\r\nloose skin hanging over one side of his face.\r\n\r\nThe Dingos worry the cattle of the settlers, and will even eat pieces\r\nout of them as they lie upon the ground; the leg of a sheep has been\r\nfrequently gnawed off by them. Domesticated dogs will hunt and kill\r\nthem; but show signs of great disgust afterwards, always, if they can,\r\nplunging themselves into water, as if to get rid of the contamination\r\ncaused by such contact. One taken from his mother at six weeks old was\r\npartially tamed; but at first he crouched down in all the darkest\r\ncorners he could find, looking at every one with aversion, and when\r\nalone howling incessantly, especially if the moon were shining. He\r\nbecame gradually reconciled to those who fed him, but to no one else. He\r\nnever gave warning of the approach of strangers, and never made an open\r\nattack. It is remarkable that these dogs are not found in the closely\r\nneighbouring island of Van Diemen's Land.\r\n\r\nThe wild dogs of India go under the name of Buansa, Dhole, and Kolsun,\r\nare found in Nepal, the Nilgiris, Coromandel, the Dekkan, etc., and bear\r\nvarious names, according to their locality. They prey night and day,\r\nhave an acute smell, a peculiar bark, not unlike that of a hound, and\r\nare of a sandy or red colour. Their head is long; they have an\r\nill-natured look, oblique eyes; long, erect ears; powerful limbs, bushy\r\ntail, fur varying according to climate, and all animals are afraid of\r\nthem. They kill tigers and cheetahs, and the remains of hogs and deer\r\nare to be found in their path. An endeavour to tame one succeeded, and\r\nhe was as affectionate and intelligent as many other dogs.\r\n\r\nIn Java there is a large, wild dog, and in Beloochistan whole packs are\r\nto be found, which pull down buffaloes with ease; their footmarks are\r\nlike those of a hound; and still further to the west a much larger\r\nspecies is said to exist.\r\n\r\nThe Sheeb or Schib, of Syria, is wild, and is probably the wolf-dog of\r\nNatolia. The Deeb of Nubia would seem to be also a primitive species,\r\nbut not resembling the packs of wild dogs which inhabit Congo and South\r\nAfrica, etc., and live in covers and burrows.\r\n\r\nThe hunters of South Africa tell us that they pull down the strongest\r\nantelopes; they are very destructive to sheep, and mangle more than they\r\ndevour. They are extremely swift, and utter a sharp bark, or chattering\r\ncry, which calls the pack together, and is very soft and melodious. The\r\nhatred between them and tame dogs is unconquerable, and in their\r\nappearance they look like a link between the wolf and the hyaena.\r\n\r\nA large group of dogs includes all the indigenous canines of South\r\nAmerica, under the name of Aguaras, and resembles foxes. They are\r\nsilent, if not dumb, and appear to congregate in families rather than\r\npacks. They have a peculiar propensity to steal and secrete, without any\r\napparent object for so doing.\r\n\r\nColonel Hamilton Smith, the able writer on dogs, does not acknowledge\r\nsome of these wild races, but thinks they are what he calls feral, or\r\ndomestic dogs which have regained their liberty, and have subsisted for\r\nmany generations on their own intelligence. To these he refers the\r\nNatolians and Aguaras; but there can be no doubt concerning the feral\r\nnature of the dog of St. Domingo, which descends from the hounds trained\r\nto hunt human beings by the Spaniards, and which are supposed to have\r\nregained their liberty in the woods of Haiti. It is of these dogs the\r\nstories are told concerning runaway negroes, and which were taught by\r\nmeans of raw food, placed in stuffed representations of human beings.\r\nThey are very handsome creatures, carrying their heads with an air of\r\nconscious superiority. They follow a track rapidly, and in complete\r\nsilence; they, however, always seize their victims.\r\n\r\nA contrast to the feral dog of St. Domingo, is the Alco of Mexico, with\r\nits small head, short neck, and very thick body. Those of the Pampas\r\nhaving assumed the shapes of all the dogs transported from Europe, have\r\nnow settled into what may be called curs. They are very bold, very\r\nsagacious, are not inimical to men, but destructive to the young animals\r\nin herds. They live in burrows, and if brought back to domesticity, are\r\nvaluable for their courage and highly developed senses.\r\n\r\nIn various cities exist herds of dogs, who do not own any masters; who\r\ninfest the streets in packs, and who are at once the scavengers, the\r\npurifiers, and the greatest nuisances. In beautiful Lisbon; rising from\r\nthe Tagus with her stately towers, her gardens, her churches, her deep\r\nblue sky, and her noble aqueduct, leading life's beverage to her\r\nexquisite fountains, these animals abound; their presence being easily\r\naccounted for by their owners bringing and abandoning them there at the\r\ntime of the vintage. They eat so many grapes when ripe, that they are\r\nsent away in self-defence. Woe to the person who affronts one of them;\r\nhe is obliged to run hard, or else to keep them at bay, by threatening\r\nto throw stones at them, and walking backwards; fortunately he can do\r\nthis in the narrow streets of this city, for he would be lost if\r\nsurrounded by them. They lodge by day in the holes of ruins, which are\r\nso plentiful in Lisbon.\r\n\r\nThe same dogs, with regard to habits, are to be met with in the cities\r\nof Russia, Turkey, and Egypt; but they differ in size and appearance.\r\nThose of Turkey are particularly audacious, and in all cities, where\r\ncleanliness is not systematically organised, they are doubtless of\r\ninfinite service; though I have read, in a pamphlet written by a French\r\n_savant_, that those in Egypt are one means of continuing the plague,\r\nfor they uncover the carelessly buried bodies, and drag portions of\r\nflesh and clothing into the houses of the living.\r\n\r\nIn some of the countries of Guinea, dogs are bred for the table, and sit\r\nin circles in the market places for sale. I do not know from what race\r\nthey come; they are not used for any other purpose, and are small,\r\nextremely ugly, and variously marked with brown, red, or black spots.\r\nThe passion for dog's flesh is in these countries very strong, and no\r\nEuropean can keep an animal of this kind many weeks. An officer arrived\r\nat Cape Coast Castle when I was there, accompanied by three, not\r\nimagining the temptation they would present to the appetite of the\r\nnatives. One disappeared in the act of landing, and the two others were\r\ngone before three weeks had elapsed. My uncle fancied that his rank\r\nwould secure a favourite sent to him from Europe. He one morning\r\nreceived a deputation from the king of a native town, requesting a\r\npalaver, or conference. It was granted, and his sable majesty formally\r\nmade proposals for Caesar to figure as a roast at a grand feast, which he\r\nwas about to hold. My uncle indignantly refused; the king increased the\r\nsum offered, till it amounted to something considerable, and then the\r\nEnglishman, unable to control himself, left the room and sent the\r\ncustomary refreshments, with a message, to signify that the palaver was\r\nended. Although every precaution was taken to save the animal, he was\r\nstolen that same night, and gratified the palates of the African\r\ngourmands.\r\n\r\nI now come to what Colonel Smith calls \"The Familiar Dogs,\" where we\r\nfind an amount of intellect, which forbids us to say that they do not\r\nreason, and where self-sacrifice, fidelity, courage, and affection, in\r\nmany instances raise them far beyond more gifted creatures. It will be\r\nadvisable to follow the series of some established work in treating of\r\nthem, and I have selected that of Colonel Hamilton Smith, both for its\r\nextent and its ability. He begins with those which are placed nearest to\r\nthe Arctic Circle of both hemispheres, and which form a group of large,\r\nwolfish dogs, with tapering noses, pointed ears, and, generally\r\nspeaking, long, white and black hair. They are fierce, broad, and often\r\nweb-footed; they swim well, hunt together or alone, and when their\r\nowners turn them out to obtain their own living, often fish with great\r\ndexterity. When they quarrel they constantly destroy each other, for\r\nthey never will give up while they are alive. Among them are the\r\nSiberian dogs, remarkable for the instinct with which they return to\r\ntheir masters, after weeks of absence and self-subsistence, to drag\r\ntheir sleighs. This is the more curious, as they are then always very\r\nill fed, and ill treated. They utter yells when about to be yoked, but,\r\nonce in file, they move silently and rapidly, sometimes, however, trying\r\nto upset their drivers.\r\n\r\nThe tail of the Esquimaux dogs is bushy, and curls very much over the\r\nback, which is covered with long, waving hair. They are very patient and\r\nfaithful, rapid in their paces, skilful and courageous when hunting,\r\ncarry burdens, and are very good tempered. They form a close attachment\r\nto their masters; and one which had been kept in confinement in\r\nEdinburgh, being let loose, entered the kitchen door, found his way\r\nthrough his owner's house, and, leaping on his bed, gave every sign of\r\naffection. At another time, as his master was walking in Princes Street\r\nGardens, his foot slipped, and he fell, upon which the dog tried to lift\r\nhim up by his coat. He was very cunning, and when he ate, strewed his\r\nmeat around him, to entice fowls and rats. He then laid himself down,\r\nand pretended to be asleep; no sooner, however, did they come, than he\r\npounced upon and killed them.\r\n\r\nA pair of Esquimaux dogs lived in the Menagerie of the Jardin des\r\nPlantes, where they were great favourites; but it was extremely painful\r\nto see the poor creatures panting with heat, and almost unable to move,\r\nduring the hot weather, only feeling happy when cold water was thrown\r\nover them. The fondness of the Esquimaux dogs for oil never ceases, and\r\nthey do not like to drink water, unless it tastes of this substance. Two\r\nof them are said to have stood hour after hour before a candle-maker's\r\nworkshop, evidently sniffing the fumes of the melted tallow with great\r\nenjoyment. Their scent is particularly delicate, which renders them\r\ninvaluable in the chase of the rein-deer. Nor are they, from their\r\nresolution and ferocity, less useful in attacking the bear, the very\r\nname of which beast, pronounced in their hearing, excites their ardour.\r\nEven in the sledge they dash after their prey, out of the track,\r\ndragging their owner into the pursuit.\r\n\r\nIn order to test the strength of the Esquimaux dogs, several experiments\r\nhave been made, among others by Captain Lyon, who found that three of\r\nthem could drag him, on a sledge weighing one hundred pounds, at the\r\nrate of a mile in six minutes. With heavy loads they are often induced\r\nto exert themselves by a woman walking before them, with a mitten in\r\nher hand. Having been accustomed to receive food from her, they believe\r\nthat in this way she offers them meat. They are particularly obedient\r\nand affectionate to women, because it is from them that they receive the\r\nonly kindnesses bestowed upon them, and a word from a female will excite\r\nthem to exertion, when the blows and threats of the men only make them\r\nobstinate.\r\n\r\nThe dog of the Hare Indians, or Mackenzie river, was first described by\r\nDr. Richardson, and is of a smaller size than the Esquimaux breed, but\r\nwith broad feet, which prevent him from sinking into the snow. One of\r\nthem, only seven months old, ran beside this gentleman's sledge for nine\r\nhundred miles, frequently carrying one of his master's mittens in his\r\nmouth; all are very gentle, and, like the Esquimaux dogs, do not bark.\r\n\r\nThe large, powerful, and handsome dogs which go by the name of\r\nNewfoundland, are not the pure breed of that country. The latter are\r\nmore slender in their make, have a sharper muzzle, a wilder look, and\r\nare generally black in colour, with a rusty spot over each eye, and a\r\ntawny muzzle. These are called Labrador dogs, and it is supposed that\r\nthey and the Esquimaux have contributed to form the commonly accepted\r\nbreed. What the latter have lost, however, in purity of blood, has been\r\ngained on the side of beauty, and there is no animal of its size which\r\nconveys a higher idea of intelligence and dignity, than the so-called\r\nNewfoundland dog. All are semi-palmate, and dive, swim, and keep longer\r\nin the water than any others of their tribe. One was picked up in the\r\nBay of Biscay, out of sight of any other vessel, fatigued and hungry,\r\nand which, judging from the circumstances, must have been there for many\r\nhours. Their fidelity, their courage, their generosity, are proverbial,\r\nand yet it is whispered that they are occasionally capricious and not to\r\nbe trusted. During long years of intercourse with these animals, I never\r\nmet with an instance of this; and I have been told that it is more apt\r\nto occur when they have been kept in confinement.\r\n\r\nA noble creature of the mixed breed, and of the usual colour--black and\r\nwhite--belonged to me, and his extreme good-nature, and endeavours to\r\nguard everything belonging to the family, made him like a confidential\r\nservant. The great defects in his disposition were heedlessness, and an\r\nunder estimate of his own power; he did not stop to _think_ before he\r\nacted, as many more cautious dogs will do; and he forgot that his weight\r\nwas so great as to spoil and crush whatever he laid himself upon. As an\r\ninstance of the former, he one day fancied he saw some one whom he knew\r\nin the street, and immediately dashed through the window, smashing not\r\nonly the glass, but the framework. Directly he had done it he felt he\r\nhad been wrong, and returning through the shattered window, which was\r\nopened for him, he hung his head and walked unbidden to a recess in the\r\nroom covered with matting, to which place he was always banished when\r\nnaughty, and seated himself. The bell was rung for the house-maid to\r\ncome and clear away the broken glass, and as the woman smiled when she\r\npassed Lion, I turned my head towards him. There he sat, with a pair of\r\nmy slippers, accidentally left in the room, in his mouth, as if he\r\nthought they would obtain his pardon. My gravity was disturbed, and\r\nLion, seeing this, humbly came up to me, and rested his chin on my\r\nknees. I then lectured him concerning the mischief he had committed; and\r\nhe so perfectly understood, that for a long time, when any one pointed\r\nto the window, he would hang his head and tail, and look ashamed. During\r\nmy absence he constantly collected articles which belonged to me, and\r\nslept upon them. One day, on returning from church, he met me on the\r\nstairs, dragging a new silk dress along with him by the sleeve, which he\r\nmust have contrived, by himself, to have abstracted from a peg in a\r\ncloset.\r\n\r\nIt must be owned that, clever as my Lion was, Professor Owen was\r\nacquainted with a Lion who surpassed him. This gentleman was walking\r\nwith a friend, the master of the dog, by the side of a river, near its\r\nmouth, on the coast of Cornwall, and picked up a small piece of\r\nsea-weed. It was covered with minute animals, and Mr. Owen observed to\r\nhis companion, throwing the weed into the water, \"If this small piece\r\nafforded so many treasures, how microscopically rich the whole plant\r\nwould be; I should much like to have one!\" The gentleman walked on; but\r\nhearing a splashing in the water, turned round, and saw it violently\r\nagitated. \"It is Lion!\" both exclaimed, \"What can he be about? He was\r\nwalking quietly enough by our side a minute ago.\" At one moment they saw\r\nhis tail above the water, then his head raised for a breath of air, then\r\nthe surrounding element shook again, and at last he came ashore, panting\r\nfrom his exertions, and laid a whole plant of the identical weed at Mr.\r\nOwen's feet. After this proof of intelligence, it will not be wondered\r\nat, that when Lion was joyfully expecting to accompany his master and\r\nhis guest on an excursion, and was told to go and take care of and\r\ncomfort Mrs. Owen, who was ill, that he should immediately return to the\r\ndrawing-room, and lay himself by her side, which he never left during\r\nthe absence of his owner; his countenance alone betraying his\r\ndisappointment, and that only for a few minutes.\r\n\r\nMany instances are recorded of Newfoundland dogs having saved the lives\r\nof those who have fallen into the water, and among them was my father;\r\nwho, when he was one day missing, was traced to a deep pond in his\r\nmother's garden. His friend Trial was called; some of his young\r\nmaster's clothes were shewn to the dog, the pond was pointed out, and\r\nTrial dashed in, shortly bringing out the body. He watched all the\r\nendeavours made to restore animation, and at last aided the work by\r\nbeing allowed, when dry, to get into the bed, and with the warmth of his\r\nbody give heat and circulation to the half-expiring child.\r\n\r\nA very interesting anecdote is given of a person who was travelling\r\nthrough Holland, accompanied by a large Newfoundland dog. Walking one\r\nevening on a high bank, by the side of a canal, his foot slipped; he\r\nfell into the water, and being unable to swim, soon became senseless.\r\nWhen he recovered his recollection, he found himself in a cottage, on\r\nthe opposite side of the canal, surrounded by peasants, who had been\r\nusing all means for restoring him to life. He was told, that one of them\r\nreturning home from his work, saw at a considerable distance, a large\r\ndog swimming in the water, sometimes pushing, and sometimes dragging\r\nsomething which he appeared to have great difficulty in supporting; but\r\nwhich he at length succeeded in getting into a small creek. When there,\r\nthe animal pulled this object as far out of the water as he was able,\r\nand the peasant discovered it to be the body of a man. The dog shook\r\nhimself, licked the hands and face of his master; the peasant obtained\r\nassistance, and the body was conveyed to the house, where the\r\nendeavours used for resuscitation proved successful. Two bruises, with\r\nmarks of teeth appeared, one on the shoulder, the other on the nape of\r\nhis neck, whence it was presumed, that his preserver first seized him by\r\nthe shoulder, but that his sagacity prompted him to shift his grasp to\r\nthe neck; as by so doing he could keep the head out of the water. He had\r\ncontinued to do this for at least a quarter of a mile, and thus\r\npreserved his owner, as much by his intelligence, as by his affection.\r\n\r\nThe Newfoundland dog, like many others, possesses a sense of time, and\r\nMr. Bell relates an instance of this, which occurred under his own\r\nobservation. He says, that a fine Newfoundland dog, which was kept at an\r\ninn in Dorsetshire, was accustomed every morning as the clock struck\r\neight, to take in his mouth a certain basket, placed for the purpose,\r\ncontaining a few pence, and to carry it across the street to a baker's,\r\nwho took out the money, and replaced it by the proper number of rolls.\r\nWith these Neptune hastened back to the kitchen, and safely deposited\r\nhis trust; but what was well worthy of remark, he never attempted to\r\ntake the basket, or even to approach it on Sunday mornings. On one\r\noccasion, when returning with the rolls, another dog made an attack upon\r\nthe basket, for the purpose of stealing its contents; when the trusty\r\nNeptune placed the basket on the ground, severely punished the\r\nintruder, and then bore off his charge in triumph.\r\n\r\nThe proofs of intelligence which I have related, are perhaps surpassed\r\nby those of Dandie, a Newfoundland dog belonging to Mr. M'Intyre of\r\nEdinburgh; but it must be recollected, that Dandie's education had been\r\nmore carefully and continuously carried on, than that of his before\r\nmentioned brethren. He selected his master's hat from a number of\r\nothers, or a card chosen by his master from a whole pack; picked his\r\nmaster's penknife from a heap of others, and any particular article\r\nwhich he might have been told to find, although he would have to search\r\namong a multitude of others belonging to the same person; proving that\r\nit was not smell which guided him, but an understanding of what he was\r\nrequired to do. One evening, a gentleman in company with others,\r\naccidentally dropped a shilling on the floor, which, after diligent\r\nsearch, could not be found. Dandie had been sitting in the corner of the\r\nroom, apparently unconscious of what had been going on, Mr. M'Intyre\r\nthen said to him. \"Find us the shilling, Dandie, and you shall have a\r\nbiscuit,\" the dog instantly jumped up, and laid the shilling upon the\r\ntable, which he had picked up unperceived by the party. On his return\r\nhome one evening after the family had gone to rest, Mr. M'Intyre could\r\nnot find his boot-jack; upon which he said, \"Dandie, I cannot find my\r\nboot-jack; search for it.\" The dog scratched at the room-door, his\r\nmaster opened it, and going to a distant part of the house Dandie\r\nreturned with the boot-jack in his mouth; where Mr. M'Intyre recollected\r\nto have left it under a sofa.\r\n\r\nSeveral gentlemen were in the habit of giving Dandie a penny a day,\r\nwhich he always took to a baker's, and exchanged for bread for himself.\r\nOne of them was accosted by the dog for his accustomed present; but he\r\nsaid, \"I have not a penny with me to-day, though I have one at home.\"\r\nHaving returned to his house, some time after he heard a noise at the\r\ndoor; it was opened, and Dandie sprang in for his penny. By way of\r\nfrolic, the gentleman gave him a bad one; the baker refused to exchange\r\nthe loaf for it; the dog returned to the door, knocked, and when the\r\nservant opened it, laid the penny at her feet, and walked away with an\r\nair of contempt. He did not, however, always spend all his money, and\r\none Sunday, when it was very unlikely that he could have received a\r\npresent, he was observed to bring home a loaf. Surprised at this, Mr.\r\nM'Intyre desired the servant to search the room for money. Dandie seemed\r\nquite unconcerned till she approached the bed, when he gently drew her\r\nfrom it. Mr. M'Intyre secured him, for he growled and struggled; and,\r\ncontinuing the search, the woman found seven pence halfpenny under a\r\npiece of cloth. From that time the dog could not endure her, and\r\nhenceforth hid his money in the corner of a sawpit, under a heap of\r\ndust. He constantly escorted Mr. M'Intyre's friends home, when desired\r\nto do so, however considerable the distance, and when they were safe, he\r\nreturned to his own quarters.\r\n\r\nMr. Jukes, in his \"Excursions in and about Newfoundland,\" speaks of a\r\ndog which appeared to be of the pure breed, and which he thought to be\r\nmore intelligent than the mixed race. This animal caught his own fish,\r\nfor which purpose he sat on a projecting rock, beneath a fish stage, on\r\nwhich the fish were laid to dry, watching the water, the depth being\r\nfrom six to eight feet, and the bottom quite white with fish-bones. On\r\nthrowing a piece of codfish into the water, three or four heavy,\r\nclumsy-looking fish, called in Newfoundland _sculpins_, would swim in to\r\ncatch it. The instant one turned its broadside towards him, he darted\r\ndown, and seldom came up without the fish in his mouth. He regularly\r\ncarried them as he caught them to a place a few yards off, where he\r\ndeposited them, sometimes making a pile of fifty or sixty in the day. As\r\nhe never attempted to eat them, he appeared to fish for his amusement.\r\n\r\nLong, lanky, rough-haired, with drooping, bushy tail; long ears, half\r\nerect; long, sharp muzzle; black and fulvous in colour, often mingled\r\nwith brown and white, the Shepherd's Dog yields to none in fidelity and\r\nsagacity. In his own peculiar calling, nothing can exceed his\r\nvigilance, his quick comprehension, and his intimate knowledge of every\r\nindividual entrusted to his care. Rushing into the middle of his flock,\r\nhe singles out any one member of it, and brings it to his master. Fierce\r\nin the defence of all, he keeps them together by incessantly prowling\r\nround them, dragging the wanderers back to their companions, and\r\nfiercely attacking those who would offer them an injury. At night he\r\nguides them to their fold; and if this should be in an exposed\r\nsituation, he throws himself across the entrance, so that the intruding\r\nenemy will have to pass over his body to commence his work of\r\ndestruction.\r\n\r\nA ludicrous instance of the promptitude with which he punishes\r\noffenders, is related by Colonel Smith, in the following manner:--\"We\r\nhave witnessed the care they take of their charge, and with what\r\nreadiness they chastise those that molest them, in the case of a cur\r\nbiting a sheep in the rear of the flock, and unseen by the shepherd.\r\nThis assault was committed by a tailor's dog, but not unmarked by the\r\nother, who immediately seized him, and dragging the delinquent into a\r\npuddle, while holding his ear, kept dabbling him in the mud with\r\nexemplary gravity; the cur yelled, the tailor came slipshod with his\r\ngoose to the rescue, and having flung it at the sheep-dog, and missed\r\nhim, stood by gaping, not venturing to fetch it back until the\r\ncastigation was over and the dog had followed the flock.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE SHEPHERD'S DOG AND CUR.--Page 102.]\r\n\r\nAs a proof of the comprehension of the shepherd's dog, I quote the\r\ndescription of Mr. St. John, in his \"Highland Sports:\"--\"A shepherd\r\nonce, to prove the quickness of his dog, who was lying before the fire\r\nin the house where we were talking, said to me, in the middle of a\r\nsentence concerning something else, 'I'm thinking, Sir, the cow is in\r\nthe potatoes.' Though he purposely laid no stress on these words, and\r\nsaid them in a quiet, unconcerned tone of voice, the dog, who appeared\r\nto be asleep, immediately jumped up, and leaping through the open\r\nwindow, scrambled up the turf roof of the house, from which he could see\r\nthe potato field. He then (not seeing the cow there) ran and looked into\r\nthe byre [farm-yard], where she was, and finding that all was right,\r\ncame back to the house. After a short time the shepherd said the same\r\nwords again, and the dog repeated his look-out; but on the false alarm\r\nbeing a third time given, the dog got up, and wagging his tail, looked\r\nhis master in the face with so comical an expression of interrogation,\r\nthat we could not help laughing aloud at him, on which, with a slight\r\ngrowl, he laid himself down in his warm corner, with an offended air, as\r\nif determined not to be made a fool of again.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Hogg, the Ettrick shepherd, is the person of all others to give an\r\nadequate idea of the shepherd's dog, and I use very nearly his own\r\nwords. \"My dog Sirrah, was beyond all comparison the best dog I ever\r\nsaw; he was of a surly, unsocial temper; disdaining all flattery, he\r\nrefused to be caressed; but his attention to my commands and interests\r\nwill never again, perhaps, be equalled by any of the canine race. I\r\nthought I discovered a sort of sullen intelligence in his countenance,\r\nnotwithstanding his dejected and forlorn appearance; I gave a drover a\r\nguinea for him. He was scarcely a year old, and knew so little of\r\nherding, that he had never turned a sheep in his life; but as soon as he\r\ndiscovered that it was his duty to do so, and that it obliged me, I can\r\nnever forget with what eagerness and anxiety he learned his evolutions.\r\nHe would try every way deliberately, till he found out what I wanted him\r\nto do, and when I once made him understand a direction, he never forgot\r\nor mistook it again. Well as I knew him, he often astonished me; for\r\nwhen pressed hard in accomplishing the task that he was put to, he had\r\nexpedients of the moment, that bespoke a great share of the reasoning\r\nfaculty.\r\n\r\n\"On one occasion, about 700 lambs, which were under his care at weaning\r\ntime, broke up at midnight, and scampered off, in three divisions,\r\nacross the neighbouring hills, in spite of all that he and an assistant\r\ncould do to keep them together. The night was so dark, that we could\r\nnot see Sirrah; but the faithful animal heard his master lament their\r\nabsence in words which, of all others, were sure to set him most on the\r\nalert; and without more ado, he silently set off in quest of the\r\nrecreant flock. Meanwhile the shepherd and his companion did not fail to\r\ndo all in their power to recover their lost charge; they spent the whole\r\nnight in scouring the hills, for miles around, but of neither the lambs\r\nnor Sirrah could they obtain the slightest trace. They had nothing for\r\nit, day having dawned, but to return to their master, and inform him,\r\nthat they had lost the whole flock of lambs, and knew not what was\r\nbecome of one of them. On our way home, however, we discovered a lot of\r\nlambs at the bottom of a deep ravine, and the indefatigable Sirrah\r\nstanding in front of them, looking round for some relief, but still true\r\nto his charge. The sun was then up, and when we first came in view, we\r\nconcluded that it was one of the divisions which Sirrah had been unable\r\nto manage until he came to that commanding situation. But what was our\r\nastonishment, when we discovered that not one lamb of the whole flock\r\nwas wanting. How he had got all the divisions collected in the dark is\r\nbeyond my comprehension. The charge was left to himself from midnight\r\nuntil the rising sun, and if all the shepherds in the forest had been\r\nthere to assist him they could not have effected it with greater\r\npropriety.\"\r\n\r\nAn exceedingly good shepherd's dog appears to concentrate all his powers\r\nin his own immediate vocation; and in this does he exert and exhaust his\r\nwhole capacity. If he be suddenly awoke, and hurriedly called, he rears\r\nhimself up to see what sheep are running away, and he is so honourable,\r\nthat he will lie among pails full of milk, and neither touch them\r\nhimself, or suffer cat, rat, or any other creature to molest the store.\r\n\r\nThe drovers' dogs are somewhat larger, and more rugged. They are as\r\nsagacious as the shepherd's dog, but they are trained to act with more\r\ncruelty to their charges.\r\n\r\nThe original St. Bernard dog, which has for years been the object of so\r\nmuch interest, resembles the Newfoundland in form, hair, color and size.\r\nAnother race with close, short hair, is trained to the same services;\r\nand one of the latter belonged to me for some time, establishing himself\r\nin the good graces of every one by his good temper and fidelity. He\r\nmust, however, with all his good qualities yield to Bass, the property\r\nof Sir Thomas Dick Lauder, who thus writes of him. \"My St. Bernard was\r\nbrought home direct from the Great St. Bernard, when he was a puppy of\r\nabout four or five months. His bark is tremendous; so loud, indeed, that\r\nI have often distinguished it nearly a mile off. He had been missing for\r\nsome time; when, to my great joy, one of the letter carriers brought\r\nhim back; and the man's account was, that in going along a certain\r\nstreet, he heard his bark from the inside of a yard, and knew it\r\nimmediately. He knocked at the gate, and said to the owner of the\r\npremises 'You have got Sir Thomas Lauder's big dog.' The man denied it.\r\n'But I know you have,' continued the letter carrier, 'I can swear that I\r\nheard the bark of Sir Thomas's big dog; for there is no dog in, or about\r\nall Edinburgh, that has such a bark.' At last, with great reluctance,\r\nthe man gave up the dog to the letter carrier, who brought him home\r\nhere. But though Bass's bark is so terrific, he is the best natured and\r\nmost playful dog I ever saw; so much so indeed, that the small King\r\nCharles's spaniel, Raith, used to tyrannize over him for many months\r\nafter he came here from abroad. I have seen the little creature run\r\nfuriously at the great animal when gnawing a bone, who instantly turned\r\nhimself submissively over on his back, with all his legs in the air,\r\nwhilst Raith, seizing the bone, would make the most absurd and\r\nunavailing attempts to bestride the enormous head of his subdued\r\ncompanion, with the most ludicrous affectation of the terrible growling,\r\nthat might bespeak the loftiest description of dog-indignation. When a\r\ndog attacks Bass in the street or road, he runs away rather than\r\nquarrel; but when compelled to fight by any perseverance in the\r\nattacking party, he throws his enemy down in a moment, and then,\r\nwithout biting him, he lays his whole immense bulk down upon him, till\r\nhe nearly smothers him. He took a particular fancy for one of the\r\npostmen who deliver letters here, whose duty it was, besides delivering\r\nletters, to carry a letter bag from one receiving house to another, and\r\nthis bag he used to give Bass to carry. Bass always followed that man\r\nthrough all the villas in this neighbourhood where he had deliveries to\r\nmake, and he invariably parted with him opposite to the gate of the\r\nConvent of St. Margaret's, and returned home. When our gate was shut\r\nhere to prevent his following the postman, the dog always leaped a high\r\nwall to get after him. One day when the postman was ill, or detained by\r\nsome accidental circumstance, he sent a man in his place. Bass went up\r\nto the man, curiously scanning his face, whilst the man rather retired\r\nfrom the dog, by no means liking his appearance. But as the man left the\r\nplace, Bass followed him, shewing strong symptoms that he was determined\r\nto have the post-bag. The man did all he could to keep possession of it.\r\nBut at length Bass, seeing that he had no chance of getting possession\r\nof the bag by civil entreaty, raised himself on his hind legs, and\r\nputting a great fore-paw on, each of the man's shoulders, he laid him\r\nflat on his back in the road, and quietly picking up the bag, he\r\nproceeded peaceably on his wonted way. The man, much dismayed, arose\r\nand followed the dog, making, every now and then, an ineffectual attempt\r\nto coax him to give up the bag. At the first house he came to, he told\r\nhis fears, and the dilemma he was in, but the people comforted him, by\r\ntelling him that the dog always carried the bag. Bass walked with the\r\nman to all the houses at which he delivered letters, and along the road\r\ntill he came to the gate of St. Margaret's, where he dropped the bag and\r\nreturned home.\"\r\n\r\nThe peculiar services which the St. Bernard dog is taught to perform,\r\nhave made them the blessings of the snow-covered regions in which they\r\ndwell; their sense of smell is very acute, their large, full, eye, is\r\nvery expressive, and their intelligence has saved many persons from\r\ndeath, when overtaken by cold on the Alpine passes. One of these noble\r\ncreatures wore a medal, in commemoration of his having preserved\r\ntwenty-two lives, and he at last lost his own in an avalanche, together\r\nwith those whom he was endeavouring to protect. They carry food and wine\r\nwith them; and followed by the monks, who have vowed themselves to the\r\ntask, seek those who need assistance.\r\n\r\nIn passing over a number of dogs mentioned by Colonel Smith, concerning\r\nwhich I have no data for anecdotes, I pause for a moment at the drover,\r\nor cattle-dog of Cuba, and Terra Firma, in America, placed by him among\r\nthe native dogs, (Canis Laniarius), because they are so serviceable in\r\nlanding cattle from vessels. The oxen are hoisted out by slings passed\r\nround the base of their horns; and when they are allowed to fall into\r\nthe water, men generally swim and guide them by the horns. This office,\r\nhowever, is often performed by one or two dogs, who, catching the\r\nfrightened animal by the ears, force it to swim to the landing-place,\r\ninstantly releasing it when it touches the shore, and can walk to its\r\ndestination. They are equal to mastiffs in strength; and Colonel Smith\r\nconsiders them as the feral dogs of St. Domingo, in continued\r\ndomesticity, and to have been taken from Spain to the West.\r\n\r\nElegance of form, grace of movement, beauty of countenance,\r\nextraordinary swiftness, and great strength; are all combined in the\r\nGreyhound, as recorded during the last three thousand years; and\r\ncontinued at the present moment, in various degrees, from the noble\r\nsporting dog, to the delicate pet of the drawing-room. The narrow, sharp\r\nhead, the light, half hanging ears, the long neck, the arched back, the\r\nslender yet sinewy limbs, the deep chest, shewing the high development\r\nof the breathing organs, and the elevated hind quarters, all shadow\r\nforth the peculiar qualities of these dogs. Their coat has been adapted\r\nto the climate in which they originally lived: here it is smooth; but\r\nbecomes more shaggy as they are from colder regions. Still their\r\nEastern origin is always to be detected by the care which they require\r\nduring our winters; and (like the Arab horses) those kept for coursing\r\nare muffled up in cloths during our periods of cold temperature. Their\r\nform, their clear, prominent eyes, shew that they secure their prey by\r\nspeed, not by smell, and such is their power in this respect, that they\r\nwill run eight miles in twelve minutes, and will run down the hare with\r\nfatigue, while they themselves are comparatively fresh. Colonel Smith\r\nfixes their earliest origin to the westward of the Asiatic mountains,\r\nwhere the Bactrian and Persian plains commence, and the Scythian steppes\r\nstretch to the north. Thence they have been spread over Europe, Asia,\r\nand part of Africa, many have again become wild, and others are the\r\npampered dependents of amateur sportsmen. Many Russian noblemen keep\r\npacks of them in the Steppes.\r\n\r\nThe Scotch greyhound (Cania Scoticus), generally white, with black\r\nclouds, is said to be the most intellectual of all, and formerly to have\r\nhad so good a scent, as to be employed as a blood-hound. Maida, whose\r\nname is immortalized as the favourite of Sir Walter Scott, was a\r\nScottish greyhound.\r\n\r\nThe Irish is the largest of all the western breeds, and is supposed to\r\nowe this distinction to mingling with the great Danish dog. To it\r\nIreland owes the extirpation of wolves, and itself now scarcely exists\r\nbut in name.\r\n\r\nAn instance is recorded of a black greyhound, in Lancashire, who adopted\r\na life of freedom, and lived upon depredation. Many attempts were made\r\nto shoot her, but she eluded them all; she was at last ensnared in a\r\nbarn, where she had placed her puppies; they were destroyed, and she\r\npartially reclaimed, so as to be useful in coursing; but she always\r\nretained that wild look which told of her frolic. A Mr. Kirkpatrick\r\npossessed a greyhound which always took care of the meat in the kitchen,\r\nand defended it from cats and other dogs.\r\n\r\nThe rough, large-boned, ill-looking Lurcher, is said to have descended\r\nfrom the rough greyhound and the shepherd's dog. It is now rare, but\r\nthere are some of its sinister-looking mongrel progeny still to be seen.\r\nThey always bear the reputation of being poachers' dogs, and are deeply\r\nattached to their owners. They have a fine scent; and a man confessed to\r\nMr. Bewick, that he could, with his pair of lurchers, procure as many\r\nrabbits as he pleased. They never give tongue, but set about their work\r\nsilently and cautiously, and hunt hares and partridges, driving the\r\nlatter into the nets of the unlawful sportsmen. They will even pull down\r\ndeer.\r\n\r\nThere are still many English hearts which beat quicker at the cry of the\r\nhound; there are some old ones which throb at the recollection of the\r\nwell-appointed field, when the bugle summoned them to the chase, when\r\ngallant steeds carried them over gate, hedge, ditch, and river; they\r\neven glory when they refer to fearful tumbles, barely escaping with\r\nlife, and some meeting with a death next in honour, according to their\r\nnotions, to that of a soldier in action. There are some young ones who\r\nlisten with entranced ears to the deeds of their forefathers, and amidst\r\nthe toil of the dark counting-house, wish that such times could come for\r\nthem. They never will come again; railroads have been invented, men's\r\nminds have been diverted into other channels; and fox-hunting, with its\r\nconcomitant evils and its attendant pleasures, is gradually disappearing\r\nfrom fox-hunting England. Some, on whom the spirit of Nimrod has\r\ndescended with such force, as to render them impatient under the\r\nprivation, go to distant lands, and there perform feats worthy of the\r\nmighty hunter; but it is neither with hawk nor hound, and before many\r\ngenerations have passed, our beautiful race of hunting dogs will exist\r\nbut in name.\r\n\r\nThere are more varieties of these hounds than I can here enumerate; but\r\nall possess a larger development of brain than the greyhound; their nose\r\nis broader, as well as their jaws; their ears are large and hanging;\r\ntheir tail is raised and truncated, and they have a firm, bold, and\r\nerect gait, an appearance of strength, independence, and (if I may be\r\nallowed to use the expression) candour, which is vainly looked for in\r\nother dogs. They came to us from the East, probably at a later period\r\nthan those dogs which more resemble the wolf.\r\n\r\nThe once-esteemed Blood-hound is now rare, and I copy Mr. Bell's\r\ndescription of the breed, in possession of his namesake:--\"They stand\r\ntwenty-eight inches high at the shoulder; the muzzle broad and full, the\r\nupper lip large and pendulous, the vertex of the head protuberant, the\r\nexpression stern, thoughtful, and noble; the breast broad; the limbs\r\nstrong and muscular, and the original colour a deep tan, with large\r\nblack clouds. They are silent when following their scent; and in this\r\nrespect differ from other hounds, who are generally gifted with fine,\r\ndeep voices. Numbers, under the name of sleuth-hounds, used to be kept\r\non the Borders, and kings and troopers, perhaps equally marauders, have,\r\nin olden times, found it difficult to evade them. The noble Bruce had\r\nseveral narrow escapes from them, and the only sure way to destroy their\r\nscent was to spill blood upon the track. In all the common routine of\r\nlife they are good-natured and intelligent, and make excellent\r\nwatch-dogs. A story is related of a nobleman, who, to make trial whether\r\na young hound was well instructed, desired one of his servants to walk\r\nto a town four miles off, and then to a market-town, three miles from\r\nthence. The dog, without seeing the man he was to pursue, followed him\r\nby the scent to the above mentioned places, notwithstanding the\r\nmultitude of market people that went along the same road, and of\r\ntravellers that had occasion to come; and when the blood-hound came to\r\nthe cross market-town, he passed through the streets without taking\r\nnotice of any of the people there, and ceased not till he had gone to\r\nthe house where the man he sought rested himself, and where he found him\r\nin an upper room, to the wonder of those who had accompanied him in this\r\npursuit.\"[4]\r\n\r\nThe stately Stag-hound, with his steady, cautious qualities, is little\r\nless valuable than the blood-hound for following a scent. Marvellous\r\nfeats are related of his perseverance and strength in pursuit of his\r\ngame; but since the reign of George the Third, the breed has not been\r\nkept up. That monarch was particularly fond of this description of\r\nhunting; but now, having fallen into disuse, it is not likely to be\r\nrevived. Stag-hounds are somewhat smaller than the blood-hound; rougher,\r\nwith a wider nose, shorter head, loose hanging ears, and a rush tail,\r\nnearly erect. A most remarkable stag hunt is recorded as having taken\r\nplace in Westmoreland, which extended into Scotland. All the dogs were\r\nthrown out except two, who followed their quarry the whole way. The stag\r\nreturned to the park whence it started, where it leapt over the wall\r\nand expired, having made a circuit of at least 120 miles. The hounds\r\nwere found dead at a little distance, having been unable to leap the\r\nwall.\r\n\r\nThe fox-hounds are still smaller than the stag-hounds, are generally\r\nwhite in colour, with clouds of black and tan. They have been known to\r\nrun at full speed for ten hours, during which the hunters were obliged\r\nto change their horses three times, or abandon the pursuit.\r\n\r\nThe Harrier and the Beagle are still smaller varieties: as the name\r\nindicates, the former are used exclusively for hunting the hare, and\r\nhave nearly superseded the beagle, which is chiefly valuable for its\r\nvery musical note. There was a fancy breed of them in the time of Queen\r\nElizabeth, so small, that they could be carried in a man's glove, and\r\nwere called singing dogs. They used to be conveyed to the field in\r\npaniers.\r\n\r\nTurnspits are descended from ill-made hounds, which they resemble in\r\nbody, but have very short, and even crooked legs. They are rough or\r\nsmooth. They are said also to be derived from terriers, and it seems to\r\nme that the perpetuation of malformation in several breeds will produce\r\nthe turnspit. They derive their name from having been used to turn the\r\nkitchen spit, being put into an enclosed wheel, placed at the end for\r\nthe purpose. It is a curious fact, that now the office is abolished, the\r\nrace has become nearly extinct. I extract the following from Captain\r\nBrown's \"Popular Natural History,\" to prove, that if turnspits had\r\ncrooked legs, they had not crooked wits:--\"I have had in my kitchen,\"\r\nsaid the Duke de Liancourt, to M. Descartes, \"two turnspits, which took\r\ntheir turns regularly every other day in the wheel; one of them, not\r\nliking his employment, hid himself on the day he should have wrought,\r\nwhen his companion was forced to mount the wheel in his stead; but\r\ncrying and wagging his tail, he intimated that those in attendance\r\nshould first follow him. He immediately conducted them to a garret,\r\nwhere he dislodged the idle dog, and killed him immediately.\" The\r\nfollowing occurrence at the Jesuit's College at Fleche, shows that\r\nothers of the species have kept the turnspit to this disagreeable duty.\r\nWhen the cook had prepared the meat for roasting, he found that the dog\r\nwhich should have wrought the spit had disappeared. He attempted to\r\nemploy another, but it bit his leg and fled. Soon after, however, the\r\nrefractory dog entered the kitchen, driving before him the truant\r\nturnspit, which immediately, of its own accord, went into the wheel. A\r\ncompany of turnspits were assembled in the Abbey Church of Bath, where\r\nthey remained very quietly. At one part of the service, however, the\r\nword \"spit\" was pronounced, rather loudly. This reminded the dogs of\r\ntheir duty, and they all rushed out in a body, to go to their respective\r\ndwellings.\r\n\r\nFrom the word \"Spanish\" being often prefixed to the name of the Pointer,\r\nit is supposed that these dogs came to us from the Peninsula; but as all\r\ndogs came from the East, their more ancient origin is to be ascribed to\r\nthe Phoenicians, who brought them, not only to that country, but probably\r\nto England, although many think they were not known here before 1688.\r\n\r\nIn consequence of long training, the peculiar faculty of pointing at\r\ngame has become an innate quality on their part; young dogs inherit it,\r\nand they only require that discipline which is necessary to make all\r\npuppies behave themselves. If we look at a pointer, the first remark\r\nwhich naturally arises, is that he is a large, indolent hound. He is\r\nhowever, extremely docile and affectionate. The black are said to be the\r\nbest, but they vary in color; their fur is quite smooth, and they are\r\nconsidered very valuable dogs. Mr. Gilpin speaks of a brace of pointers,\r\nwho stood an hour and a quarter without moving. This, however, was\r\nexceeded by Clio, a dog belonging to my father, who stood with her hind\r\nlegs upon a gate for more than two hours, with a nest of partridges\r\nclose to her nose. She must have seen them as she jumped over the gate,\r\nand had she moved an inch, they would have been frightened away. My\r\nfather went on, and having other dogs, did not miss Clio for a long\r\ntime; at length he perceived she was not with the rest, and neither\r\ncame to his call or whistle; he went back to seek her, and there she\r\nstood, just as she had got over the gate. His coming up disturbed the\r\nbirds, and he shot some of them; but Clio when thus relieved, was so\r\nstiff that she could not move, and her master sat down on the grass and\r\nrubbed her legs till she could bend them again. She died of old age,\r\nhaving been with us fourteen years from her birth; there were no signs\r\nof illness: and she went out in the morning with the shooting party. The\r\nfirst question on the return of the sportsmen was, an inquire for Clio;\r\nsearch was made, and she was found quite stiff in the stable, having\r\napparently come home to die.\r\n\r\nOf the general intelligence of the pointer, the following is a proof. A\r\ngentleman shooting in Ireland, with a dog totally unused to fetch and\r\ncarry, killed a snipe. It fell in soft, boggy ground, where he could not\r\nget to pick it up. After some vain efforts to approach it, he hied on\r\nthe pointer, by saying, \"Fetch it, Fan! fetch it.\" She seemed for a\r\nmoment puzzled at such an unusual proceeding, and looked round\r\ninquisitively once or twice, as if to say; What do you mean? Suddenly\r\nthe sportsman's dilemma seemed to flash upon her. She walked on, took\r\nthe bird in her mouth quite gently, and carried it to where the ground\r\nwas firm; but not one inch further would she bring it, despite all the\r\nencouragement of her master, who now wished to make her constantly\r\nretrieve. This, however, was the first and last bird she ever lifted.\r\n\r\nA favourite pointer was lent by a gentleman to a friend; but after some\r\nyears of trial, finding the dog would not hunt with him, the friend\r\nrequested his master, then in Ireland, to receive him back. He was\r\nconveyed in a packet from Bristol to Cork, and his owner went to meet\r\nhis dog. The vessel was at some distance from the shore; but seeing him\r\non the deck, the gentleman hailed the sailors, and requested he might be\r\nsent in a boat. No sooner, however, did the dog hear his master's voice,\r\nthan he leaped into the water, and with great demonstrations of joy swam\r\nto him on the shore. Such meetings have frequently been too much for\r\ndogs, who have died from excessive joy at seeing those they loved, after\r\na long absence.\r\n\r\nThe sporting dog called the Setter, is distinguished by his long, silky\r\nhair, and has consequently been considered as a large spaniel. The head\r\nshews an unusual development of brain; and his character for affection\r\nand intelligence corresponds with this formation. He is very handsome,\r\nis said to have come from Spain to this country, and his original colour\r\nto have been deep chestnut, or white. He is now marked with brown, or\r\nblack, as well as having these colours.\r\n\r\nA gentleman in Ireland received a present of a beautiful black setter\r\npuppy, from an unknown hand. He bred and cherished him, and the memory\r\nof Black York is still fresh in his country; not only for his perfect\r\nsymmetry, his silky, raven black hair, but for his gentle, submissive\r\ndisposition. He was a nervous dog when young, for even a loud word\r\nalarmed him, which, combined with his mysterious arrival, and an\r\ninvoluntary affection, induced his master to transfer him from the\r\nkennel to the drawing-room. From that time York acquired confidence, and\r\nlost his timidity; he first walked out with the nursemaids and children,\r\nand then accompanied his master. The latter went one morning to a rushy\r\nfield, to look at some newly born foals; and there York pointed to a\r\nsnipe. The bird rose, and pitched some hundred yards away, York's nose\r\ndetected him a second time: he crept on a dozen paces, and couched\r\nagain. This circumstance betokened his natural perfections; but with his\r\ntemperament, the firing a gun might be a dangerous trial. He was taken\r\nday after day to mark the snipes, and praised for his conduct. After\r\nthis, his master took his gun and an attendant, with orders to the\r\nlatter, if York should attempt to levant or run away, he was to catch\r\nhim in his arms. It occurred as he had anticipated; poor York was\r\ndreadfully frightened; every limb quivered, but he was soothed by\r\ncaresses, and encouraged to go where the dead snipe was lying. In a\r\nmoment he appeared to comprehend the whole. He smelled the snipe,\r\nlooked at the gun, then in his master's face, and became bolder when he\r\nthere saw approbation. Another point, another shot, and another snipe;\r\nand York and his master returned home; the gun was put in the corner,\r\nand the snipes close by, on the carpet. A dozen times, while his master\r\nwas drinking his wine, York stole quietly to the corner, smelled the\r\nsnipes, and examined the gun. From that day he gave up walking with the\r\nnursemaids, and became a matchless field dog.\r\n\r\nYork was never willingly separated from his master, and was very unhappy\r\nat his absence; he soon ascertained, that a carpet bag put into the gig,\r\nwas the signal for going away; and one day, he secretly followed, and\r\nonly shewed himself when he thought he was at such a distance that he\r\ncould not be sent back again. He was taken into the gig, and by this\r\nmeans escaped a sad death.\r\n\r\nWhile he was away, a mad dog infected the kennel, and nine setters, and\r\ntwo Skye terriers were obliged to be killed, Black York alone remaining.\r\n\"From the moment,\" says York's master, \"I took him from the kennel to\r\nthe parlour, he cut all low connections; on the human race his\r\naffections seemed to be concentrated, and on one occasion, he gave a\r\nmarked instance of his fidelity and intelligence. His mistress had gone\r\nwith her maid to the beach to bathe, and a general permission had been\r\ngiven to the servants to go to the neighbouring fair a mile off. The\r\nyoung nurse, in the giddiness of girlhood, left the baby in his cot.\r\nAccording to the then existing custom, the hall-door was wide open and,\r\nsave the sleeping baby, Black York and cats, no living thing held\r\npossession of the premises. A strange priest arrived, to ask and receive\r\nhospitality. He entered the hall, and the dog, otherwise quiet, sprang\r\nforward and assailed him like a tiger. The priest retreated, York's back\r\nwas ridged for battle, and a mouthful of unquestionable teeth hinted to\r\nhis Reverence, that the canine customer would prove an ugly one. He\r\nretreated accordingly, and York sat down beside his sleeping charge.\r\nThere he remained on guard until the absent mother returned; when she\r\nentered the drawing room, her four legged representative laid his tongue\r\ngently across the infant's face, and without opposition permitted Father\r\nMalachi to walk in.\"\r\n\r\nEqually interesting is the biography of Mr. Bell's setter, Juno, who\r\nfrom a puppy was one of the best dogs that ever entered a field. \"She\r\nappeared to be always on the watch, to evince her love and gratitude to\r\nthose who were kind to her;\" and she had other than human friends. \"A\r\nkitten, which had been taken from its mother, shewed the usual horror of\r\ncats at Juno's approach. She however seemed determined to conquer the\r\nantipathy, and by the most winning perseverance completely attached the\r\nkitten to her; and as she had lately lost her puppies, she became its\r\nfoster-mother. Juno also played with some tame rabbits, enticing them by\r\nher kind manner; and so fond was she of caressing the young of her own\r\nspecies, that when a spaniel of my father's had puppies, and all but one\r\nwere destroyed, Juno would take every opportunity of stealing this from\r\nits mother, and lick and fondle it with the greatest tenderness. When\r\nthe poor mother discovered the theft, she hastened to bring back her\r\nlittle one; only to be stolen again at the first opportunity, until at\r\nlength, Juno and Busy killed the poor puppy between them, from excess of\r\ntenderness.\"\r\n\r\nI close this account of the setter, by giving an instance of the\r\nremarkable power of dogs to return to their homes from a distance, so\r\noften cited, and which was exemplified by my father's setter Flush, a\r\ndog of remarkable beauty and value. His master drove him in his dog cart\r\nas far as London, a distance of above fifty miles, being the first stage\r\nof a shooting excursion in another county. The carriage was so\r\nconstructed, that the opening to admit air was above, and not at the\r\nsides, so that Flush could not possibly have seen any part of the road.\r\nOn his arrival in town, the groom tied him up by a cord, with access to\r\na kennel in the yard of the inn where my father stopped. He saw him the\r\nlast thing at night, but in the morning the rope had been severed, and\r\nthe dog was gone. All inquiries proved fruitless, it was supposed the\r\ngreat value of the dog had tempted some one to purloin him, and in great\r\ntrouble his master wrote home his lamentations. Late in the evening of\r\nthe day in which he was missed, my mother heard a scratching and whining\r\nat the front door, as she passed through the hall. Not supposing in any\r\nway it could relate to her, she did not heed it. In about half an hour a\r\nsmothered bark met her ears, and then she ordered a servant to open the\r\nhall door and ascertain the cause. There was poor Flush--wet, dirty,\r\nhungry, and weary; with the remainder of the rope hanging to his neck.\r\nHe had never been a house dog, and that he should seek the\r\ndwelling-house rather than the stable at some little distance, was\r\nanother proof of his sagacity; he knew he should be there more\r\nimmediately cared for, and so he was. My mother fed him herself; and,\r\nstretched before the fire, he forgot his troubles. The joyful news was\r\nconveyed to my father, as fast as the post would take it, and from that\r\ntime Flush was a companion in the drawing-room, as well as in the\r\nshooting excursion.\r\n\r\nThe infinite variety of spaniels almost precludes a separate enumeration\r\nof each in a limited work, I shall, therefore, confine myself to a few\r\ngeneral remarks. He may be called a small setter, as the setter is\r\ncalled a large spaniel, having the same long hair and ears; but the\r\nformer is even more silken in its texture. With some it curls more, and\r\nis a little harsher, and these are fonder of the water than the others.\r\nTheir attachments are strong, their intelligence great, and the beauty\r\nof some of them makes them much sought as pets; they are, however,\r\ngenerally useful to the sportsman. The only fault which can be laid to\r\ntheir charge, and this perhaps only extends to a few, is, that they are\r\napt to love strangers as well as friends. As an instance to the\r\ncontrary, was a beautiful little red and white Blenheim, who was most\r\nunsociable, and whose affections were most difficult to win. I, however,\r\nsucceeded, when on a visit to her mistress; and two years after, when I\r\nrepeated my visit, expected to have the same difficulty. She, however,\r\nwhen the first bark had been given, became silent, and she did not\r\nfavour me with a sly bite on the heel, as she was in the habit of doing\r\nto strangers. Before the evening was over, the recognition was complete,\r\nand she jumped into my lap. Her mistress took pains to prevent her from\r\ncoming in contact with vulgar dogs, always thought her possessed of the\r\nmost refined habits, and was sure she never would be too fat, because\r\nshe ate so delicately. One evening, a small, social party of us were\r\nlistening to the music of Handel, executed by two of the finest\r\nperformers in the world, when through the door, which stood a little way\r\nopen, Fanny glided in, with a large piece of fat and skin in her mouth.\r\nI thought I was the only person who saw her, and remained quite still;\r\npresently my eye caught that of the gentleman of the house, who made a\r\nsign that he also had discovered her, and our equanimity was much\r\ndisturbed. She crouched rather than walked round the room, dragging her\r\n_bonne bouche_ over the rich folds of the delicately-tinted silk damask\r\ncurtains, as they lay upon the ground, till she reached a very obscure\r\ncorner under the piano, where she proceeded to enjoy herself. As soon as\r\nthe glorious music was concluded, \"Did you see Fanny?\" was the\r\nexclamation, and the delinquent was dragged out before the last morsel\r\nwas devoured; so there was proof positive. The next morning the cook\r\ntold her mistress that she was in the habit of stealing such morsels as\r\nI have described, and hiding them, and that she only took them out to\r\neat when she [the cook] was gone to church. Poor Fanny's reputation for\r\nrefinement was for ever clouded.\r\n\r\nIn the same house lived a larger spaniel, of the variety which takes to\r\nthe water, and named Flora. She was an excellent house-dog, and,\r\ngenerally speaking, under no restraint. Some alarm, however, occasioned\r\nby a real or reported accident, caused the magistrate of the town in\r\nwhich her master resided, to issue an order, that no dogs should leave\r\nthe premises of their owners without being muzzled. Accordingly, Flora,\r\nwhen she went out with the servant, had this instrument put on; she\r\nhated it at first, tried all she could to get it off, but at length\r\nappeared to become indifferent to the confinement which it produced. In\r\nconsequence of this, it was, perhaps, more carelessly buckled on, and\r\none day it came off, and the man stooped to put it in its place; Flora,\r\nhowever, was too quick for him, she took it up in her mouth, plunged\r\nwith it into a neighbouring pond, and when she reached the deepest part,\r\ndropped the muzzle into it, and swam back, with her countenance\r\nexpressing delight.\r\n\r\nAll dogs enjoy the sport to which they are bred, and M. Blase tells us,\r\nthat he was once shooting near Versailles, when his friend, M.\r\nGuilleman, accompanied him, with permission to kill wild ducks on the\r\npreserve. There was but one dog between them, but at the first shot, a\r\nfine spaniel ran up to them at full speed. He plunged into the water,\r\nand caressing M. Guilleman, seemed to say--\"Here I am at your service;\r\namuse me, and I will amuse you.\" The gentlemen pursued their sport all\r\nday, and the dog proved excellent. No one appeared to own him; but the\r\nsport over, off he set at full gallop, and they saw him no more. They\r\nspoke of him to the keeper of the water, who informed them, that the dog\r\nbelonged to a sportsman living two leagues distant, who was at that time\r\nlaid up with the gout. \"The dog knows,\" added the keeper, \"that persons\r\ncome to shoot here every Sunday; and on that day, regularly makes his\r\nappearance. Having done his duty for the first sportsman whom he meets,\r\nhe returns to his master.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Martin, in his clever little treatise on dogs, vouches for the truth\r\nof the following story:--\"One morning, as a lady was lacing her boots,\r\none of the laces broke. She playfully said to her pet spaniel who was\r\nstanding by her, 'I wish you would find me another boot lace,' but\r\nhaving managed to use that which was broken, she thought no more about\r\nit. On the following morning, when she was again lacing her boots, the\r\ndog ran up to her with a new silken boot-lace in his mouth. This created\r\ngeneral amazement; for where the dog had obtained it no one could tell.\r\nThere was no doubt, however, that he had purloined it from some one\r\nelse.\"\r\n\r\nA black and white spaniel, belonging to a friend of mine, seemed to\r\nunderstand everything said to him, and if his master whispered in his\r\near, \"Find something for your master,\" every loose article which he\r\ncould carry was sure to be laid at his master's feet, and frequently the\r\nladies of the family were obliged to lock their work-boxes, to prevent\r\ntheir contents from being carried off by Dash. If one glove were\r\nmissing, and the other were shown to him, he did not rest till he had\r\nfound it; and, one day I saw him push a pile of music-books off a\r\nWhat-not, and drag a glove out which had been deemed irrecoverable. A\r\ncountryman, charged with a letter to be delivered to Dash's master,\r\narrived at the house while that gentleman was at breakfast. The man was\r\nshown into a parlour, where he was about to sit down, when a growl\r\nsaluted his ears. Turning round, he saw Dash lying in a chair near the\r\nfire-place, who reared his head, and the ring of the bell-pull hanging\r\nclose by, he put his paw in it. As often as the man attempted to sit, so\r\noften did Dash growl; till at last the stranger's curiosity being\r\nexcited, as to what the dog would do if he persevered, he sat down in a\r\nchair. Dash then effectually pulled the bell; and the servant who\r\nanswered the summons, was much astonished when he heard who had rung.\r\nHe, however, was equally pleased, for it explained a mystery which had\r\nlong puzzled him and his fellow servants. It seemed, that whenever any\r\nof them sat up for their master or mistress when they were out, the\r\nparlour bell was sure to ring immediately after they had settled\r\nthemselves to sleep. Of course they had never suspected the spaniel,\r\nalthough, when they afterwards discussed the matter, they recollected\r\nthat when they awoke, he was not to be seen. There was no doubt that\r\ndirectly he saw their eyes closed, he went to the bell in order to rouse\r\nthem to watchfulness.\r\n\r\nEven surpassing these histories of reason and fidelity, is that which\r\nMr. Bell relates, in nearly the following terms:--\"My friend was\r\ntravelling on the continent, and his faithful dog was his companion.\r\nOne day, before he left his lodgings in the morning, with the\r\nexpectation of being absent till the evening, he took out his purse in\r\nhis room, for the purpose of ascertaining whether he had taken\r\nsufficient money for the day's occupation, and then went his way,\r\nleaving the dog behind. Having dined at a coffee-house, he took out his\r\npurse, and missing a Louis d'or, searched for it diligently, but to no\r\npurpose. Returning home late in the evening, his servant let him in with\r\na face of sorrow, and told him that the poor dog was very ill, as she\r\nhad not eaten anything all day, and what appeared very strange, she\r\nwould not suffer him to take her food away from before her, but had been\r\nlying with her nose close to the vessel without attempting to touch it.\r\nOn my friend entering the room, she instantly jumped upon him, then laid\r\na Louis d'or at his feet, and immediately began to devour her food with\r\ngreat voracity. The truth was now apparent; my friend had dropped the\r\nmoney in the morning, when leaving the room, and the faithful creature\r\nfinding it, had held it in her mouth until his return enabled her to\r\nrestore it to his own hands; even refusing to eat for a whole day, lest\r\nit should be out of her custody.\"\r\n\r\nAll dogs trained for the service may become Retrievers or finders of\r\ngame, which they bring to their master without injury. Spaniels,\r\nhowever, are generally preferred. Mr. St. John had one called Rover, a\r\nblack water-spaniel, who noticed everything that was spoken, and acted\r\naccordingly. If at breakfast-time his master said, \"Rover must stop at\r\nhome to-day, I cannot take him out,\" Rover never offered to go: but if\r\nhe said, \"I shall take Rover with me to-day,\" the moment breakfast was\r\nover, he was on the alert, never losing sight of his master. Plans were\r\nfrequently made for the ensuing morning in the dog's presence; and one\r\nday he was not taken; ever after, when Rover heard over night what was\r\nto take place, he started alone, very early, and met the party, sitting\r\nin front of the road with a peculiar kind of grin on his face,\r\nexpressing a doubt of being well received, in consequence of coming\r\nwithout permission. Directly, however, he saw he was well received, he\r\nthrew off his affected shyness, and jumped about with delight.\r\n\r\nThough a most aristocratic dog in his usual habits, when staying in\r\nEngland with Mr. St. John, he struck up an acquaintance with a\r\nrat-catcher and his curs, assisting them in their business, watching at\r\nthe rat-holes where the ferrets were in, and being the best dog of all;\r\nfor he never gave a false alarm, or failed to give a true one. The\r\nmoment he saw his master, however, he cut his humble friends, and\r\ndeclined their acquaintance in the most comical manner.\r\n\r\nA dark-brown retriever, named Sam, was in the habit of going into a\r\nkennel of hounds, who always crowded round and caressed him. When they\r\nwere in the field at exercise, Sam was told to go and amuse them; he\r\nthen went among them, jumped Jim Crow, and played all sorts of antics,\r\nleaping and tumbling about in the most laughable manner, they looking at\r\nhim most attentively. He went with his master to call upon a lady; she\r\npatted him, asked if he were the celebrated Sam, and hearing he was, she\r\ninvited him to stay with her. The animal ran to his master, looked up,\r\nand seemed to ask for his consent. He was told to return to the lady,\r\nand take care of her, upon which he ran to her, took her basket from\r\nher, and tried to express his willingness to serve her. He remained with\r\nher for some hours, and when his master arrived to fetch him, the lady\r\nwas so pleased, that she asked for his company till the next day. Sam's\r\nowner petted and praised him, told him to be a good dog, and stay with\r\nthe lady until she had given him his breakfast the next day. The dog was\r\ncontented to remain, ate his breakfast on the ensuing morning, then\r\nlooked up in the lady's face, wagged his tail, left the house, and ran\r\nhome. He was in the habit of fetching his master's clothes, and of\r\nreturning them to their proper places; and he knew their names. He sat\r\nin a chair at dinner with the family, without making any confusion; or\r\ndined alone, alternately taking a piece of bread and meat, and then\r\ndrinking a little milk; and if any one said, \"Give me a piece, Sam,\" he\r\ninstantly obeyed. When all was gone, he cleared away the things. He\r\nwould fetch his master's horse from the inn, pay the hostler, and ride\r\nback upon the saddle. In short, he seemed to comprehend every thing that\r\nwas said to him and was a model of good nature and obedience.\r\n\r\nWonderful as these stories are as matters of reason, they are perhaps\r\nexceeded by some of the tricks performed by the Poodle-Dogs, who are\r\neasily distinguished by their crisply curling hair, their large round\r\nhead, and long ears, and to whom water is as welcome and familiar as\r\nland. Two of them, educated in Milan, exhibited their powers in Paris,\r\nand I can vouch for the veracity of the following statement:--The elder\r\nwas named Fido, and the younger Bianco. The former was a serious, steady\r\ndog, who walked about with much solemnity; but Bianco was giddy and\r\nfrolicsome. A word was given to Fido from the Greek, Latin, Italian,\r\nFrench, or English languages, and selected from a book, where fifty\r\nwords in each tongue were inscribed, which, altogether, made three\r\nhundred combinations. He selected from the letters of the alphabet those\r\nwhich composed the given word, and laid them in order at the feet of his\r\nmaster. On one occasion, the word _heaven_ was told to him, and he\r\nquickly placed the letters till he came to the second _e_, when, after\r\nvainly searching for the letter in his alphabet, he took it from the\r\nfirst syllable, and inserted it in the second. He went through the four\r\nfirst rules of arithmetic in the same way, with extraordinary celerity,\r\nand arranged the double cyphers in the same way as the double vowel in\r\nheaven. Bianco, however, although so heedless, was quicker than Fido,\r\nand when the latter made a mistake, was called on to rectify it, but as\r\nquickly dismissed, as he was wont to pull his companion's ears, to come\r\nand play with him.\r\n\r\nOne day Fido spelt the word _Jupiter_ with a _b_, but the younger\r\n_savant_ being summoned to correct the error, he carefully contemplated\r\nthe word, and pushing out the _b_, replaced it with a _p_. A lady held\r\nher repeating watch to the ear of Fido, and made it strike eight and\r\nthree quarters. Fido immediately selected an 8, and then a 6, for the\r\nthree-quarters; the company present and the master insisted upon his\r\nerror, and he again looked among his cyphers, but being unable to\r\nrectify it, he coolly sat himself down in the middle and looked at those\r\naround him. The watch was again sounded, and it was ascertained that it\r\nstruck two for every quarter, which quite exonerated Fido. Both dogs\r\nwould sit down to play ecarte, asking each other for, or refusing cards,\r\nwith the most important and significant look, cutting at proper times,\r\nand never mistaking one card for another. Bianco occasionally won, and\r\nwent to the cyphers to mark his points, and when he was asked how many\r\nhis adversary had gained, he took out an 0 with his teeth. They\r\nsometimes played at ecarte with one of the company assembled to see\r\nthem, when they evinced the same correctness, and seemed to know all the\r\nterms of the game. All this passed without the slightest audible or\r\nvisible sign between them and their master.\r\n\r\nThere is a water dog at Hastings, belonging to Page the boatman, who, on\r\nreceiving a penny, immediately takes it to a baker's shop for the\r\npurchase of a roll, nor will he part with it till the person who serves\r\nhim has put the bread upon the counter; he then lays it down, and walks\r\noff with his purchase in his mouth. Another dog of this kind, also of my\r\nacquaintance, was the family carrier; that is, she carried books, work,\r\netc., to any person or any room pointed out to her; and as we rather\r\nencroached on her, she lost almost all her teeth from the hard and heavy\r\nburthens with which she was laden. We had only to say, \"Cora, take this\r\nto so and so,\" and if the good dog could not find the person, she\r\nbrought it back and stood before us. At the same hour every afternoon,\r\nshe, untold, brought her master's boot-jack and slippers into his study,\r\nto be in readiness for his return.\r\n\r\nUnder the despised name of curs, Colonel Smith classes the sharpest, the\r\ndrollest, the most pertinacious, the most mischievous, and yet the most\r\nuseful terrier; together with several other small dogs. Long-haired,\r\nrough-haired, long-eared, short-eared, brush-tailed, smooth-tailed,\r\nlong-legged, short-legged, black-eyed, black-nosed; white, brown, black,\r\ntan, sandy, mixed; every degree of pure or mongrel blood; terriers of\r\nall kinds swarm around us, playing all sorts of antics, evincing all\r\nkinds of impertinences, catching all sorts of vermin, and presenting\r\nthemselves to us in every shape of beauty or ugliness, of which their\r\nrace is capable.\r\n\r\nThe most ancient of this influential, if not respectable tribe of dogs,\r\nindeed the most ancient dog of Great Britain, is the Scotch Terrier,\r\nbrought to us, probably, from the north-west of Europe by our primitive\r\ninhabitants. There are two varieties of indigenous terriers--the one,\r\nsmooth, usually white or black in colour, with tan spots; sharp muzzle;\r\nbright and lively eyes; pointed or slightly turned-down ears; and tail\r\ncarried high. It is, however, supposed that the Scottish race, with a\r\nshorter and fuller muzzle, stouter limbs, hard, shaggy fur, sometimes\r\nwhite in colour, but more often sandy or ochry, is the oldest and most\r\ngenuine breed. One of these clever and excellent beasts, named Peter,\r\nlived with my mother for some years, and during the whole of that time\r\nevinced the greatest sagacity and attachment. He constantly understood\r\nthe conversation, provided it related to cats, rats, or himself; and\r\noften when we spoke of him casually, without even knowing he was in the\r\nroom, or calling him by his name, he has laid his head on our knees and\r\nwagged his tail, as much as to say, \"I understand.\" He was a most\r\ninveterate enemy to all rats, mice, and cats, nipping them in the back\r\nof the neck, and throwing them over his head at the rate of one in a\r\nminute. Before he came into our family, he won a wager that he would\r\nkill twelve rats in twelve minutes: the second rat fastened on his lip,\r\nand hung there while he despatched the other ten, and then, within the\r\ngiven time, he finished that also. The inhumanity of such wagers did not\r\nrest with him. He was stolen more than once, and brought back when a\r\nreward was advertised; and, the first time, the signs of suffering about\r\nhim were very manifest. The beard under the chin, the tufts of the ears,\r\nthe fringes of the legs, had been all cut off, and he had been rubbed\r\nwith red ochre to disguise him for sale. He was placed with many others\r\nin a cellar, ready for shipping, and the dog-dealer, or rather\r\ndog-stealer, who brought him to us, said he thought he would have died\r\nof grief in a day or two, for he refused to eat, and seemed to be\r\ninsensible either to kindness or anger. For three weeks he hung his head\r\nand shrunk into corners, as if he felt himself degraded; but at last our\r\ncaresses and encouragement brought back his usual bold and lively\r\nbearing.\r\n\r\nFor the last three months of my mother's existence, Peter was almost\r\nalways on her bed, night and day; and during the final four weeks, when\r\ndeath was daily expected, he was sad and dull: which was attributed to\r\nthe change in the habits of the family. Forty-eight hours before all was\r\nover, Peter crept into a corner under the bed, which had always been his\r\nplace of refuge when in trouble; and we with difficulty prevailed on him\r\nto quit it, even when his mistress wished to see and say farewell to\r\nhim. On that occasion he hung his head, and appeared to be so miserable,\r\nthat apprehensions of malady on his part were entertained. He returned\r\nto his corner, and was not thought of for some time. At length all was\r\nquiet in the room, and I was about to leave it, when I recollected\r\nPeter. He was with difficulty prevailed on to leave his corner, where he\r\nlay, curled up and trembling. I lifted him up to take a last look of his\r\nbeloved mistress, but he laid his head on my shoulder, and was so much\r\ndistressed that I carried him away immediately. On the following day, he\r\naccompanied me up stairs, and when I passed my mother's door, he looked\r\nup in my face as much as to say, \"Are you going in there?\" but I replied\r\n\"No!\" and he never again asked for entrance. The coffin was soldered\r\ndown, and removed from the bed-room to the dining-room; and thus had to\r\npass the drawing-room where all the family were assembled. On ordinary\r\noccasions, Peter was furious at the sound of strange footsteps in the\r\nhouse, and even barked loudly when any one knocked or rang at the\r\nstreet-door. On this occasion, however, he suffered the men employed to\r\npass and repass frequently, without making the slightest noise; but that\r\nhe was conscious of some unusual occurrence was evident from his jumping\r\ninto my arms, where, as the coffin was brought down, he sat with ears\r\nerect, and eyes fixed, and panted and trembled in the most agitated\r\nmanner till all was quiet. As long as the body remained in the house, he\r\ntook every opportunity of walking round it and lying under it, and when\r\nit was removed at five o'clock one morning, to begin its journey to the\r\nfamily vault, he was again much agitated, but never offered to bark. On\r\nthe following day, I and others started to attend the funeral at a\r\nconsiderable distance, and my daughters were to arrive at eight o'clock,\r\nto pass the day in the house of their deceased grandmother. I took leave\r\nof Peter, placed him on a mat in the hall, and said, \"Stay there till\r\nthe girls come.\" He laid himself down; and the servants assured me, he\r\nnever moved till the parties arrived; when he met them with subdued\r\nlooks, and closely attached himself to them as long as they were\r\npresent. I returned two hours after midnight; and the first sound which\r\nI heard, when the carriage stopped at the door, was a noisy\r\ndemonstration of joy from Peter. He thenceforward resumed all his usual\r\nhabits, barking on all occasions; but he never was quite the same in\r\ndisposition. He grew indifferent to every one except my brother, never\r\nplayed again; and four years after was found dead in his corner of\r\nrefuge.\r\n\r\nBut it is not in a mournful light alone that we must view the Scotch, or\r\nindeed any other terrier; for they are the most untiring playful beings\r\nunder the sun. I picked up a poor little expiring puppy by the edge of a\r\npond one day, recovered him, brought him up, and there never was a more\r\nfaithful or amusing beast. He proved to be a shaggy Scotch terrier; and\r\nhis heedless youth had to undergo many corrections before he became the\r\nperfect model of obedience which his maturity presented. One of his\r\nmisdemeanours was, to kill the young chickens. The woman who managed the\r\npoultry could not imagine why these little creatures died so fast, and\r\nat first suspected that they picked up and swallowed something which\r\npoisoned them. She, however, opened one, and did not find anything in it\r\nwhich confirmed her suspicions; but the feathers were ruffled on the\r\nback of the neck, and she was then convinced that they were destroyed by\r\na much larger animal than themselves. She watched for some days; and at\r\nlength saw Mr. Bruin, my dog, creep through a little hole in the palings\r\nof the yard, and squat himself down, very gravely, as if he had not a\r\nthought of mischief in him; presently a little chicken ran past him,\r\nsnap went Bruin at the back of its neck, and giving it a toss over his\r\nhead as he would a rat, the little thing was dead. Another was served in\r\nthe same way; and I was then called to inflict the punishment I thought\r\nmost proper. I was averse to beating him at first, so I pointed to the\r\nchicken, and scolded him so much that he appeared to be very sorry for\r\nwhat he had done. But he was then young and giddy, and the impression\r\nmade was but slight. In three days he returned to his tricks, and I was\r\nobliged to chastise him more severely. I tied a dead chicken round his\r\nneck, beat him, and shut him up all day in a tool-house, where I visited\r\nhim several times, pointed to the chicken, and repeated how naughty he\r\nwas. He was so ashamed that he could not look me in the face, and in the\r\nevening, when I released him, he could not eat. He recovered his gaiety\r\nin a day or two because he was entirely forgiven; but he never again\r\nwent into the poultry-yard, and if by chance he saw a chicken, he would\r\nhang his head and tail, and walk round it at such a distance, that he\r\nevidently recollected his former conduct.\r\n\r\nThe great friend and playmate of Bruin, was Pincher a very accomplished,\r\nsmooth terrier, capital dog to go with the hounds, and to kill all sorts\r\nof obnoxious animals. If the two appeared to be asleep, and we\r\nexclaimed \"Cat!\" or \"Rat!\" in one instant they were on their legs,\r\nseeking in every direction for their game. They hunted on their own\r\naccount sometimes, and were often seen with a red spaniel, trotting\r\nthrough the fields, no doubt conspiring together to have a feast. Both\r\nBruin and Pincher were perfectly aware when Sunday came round; and\r\nalthough on other days, when they saw us equipped for a walk, they were\r\nmost vociferous in their entreaties to go also, on Sunday they hid\r\nthemselves under the sofa, and never offered to accompany us. They knew\r\nwhere we went, and generally came to meet us on our return, sometimes\r\nventuring as far as the gate of the churchyard, which was a mile\r\ndistant, but never went within the enclosure.\r\n\r\nOne of my brothers, who was more peculiarly Pincher's master, had a\r\ngreat fancy to be a doctor as he called it; and he chipped various flint\r\nstones into fancied instruments. With these he pretended to perform\r\noperations on Pincher, who would lie perfectly passive under his hands,\r\nto have his teeth drawn, his limbs set, his wounds bandaged, his veins\r\nopened. The grand finale used to be an entire cutting up, which the boy\r\ncopied from the same process practised on pigs. The dog was laid upon a\r\ntable, with his legs stuck out which he made as stiff as possible. His\r\nhead was then cut off, and as soon as the flint was passed across his\r\nthroat, the head fell on one side, and it might have been thought that\r\nthe dog fancied it was really off, so entirely did he let it lie without\r\nmotion. The flint was then passed round his legs, each of which fell\r\ndown without further movement, as close to the body as he could pull\r\nthem. At last, when all was ended, my brother said, \"Jump up, good dog!\"\r\nand Pincher bounding off the table shook himself to life again.\r\n\r\nA favourite terrier was in the habit of accompanying his master, who was\r\na clergyman, to church, where he was so perfectly quiet, that few\r\npersons knew of his presence. On one occasion, he went to a funeral, and\r\nwhen the procession left the church, accompanied his master to the side\r\nof the grave, where he mingled with the attendants. The parties remained\r\nfor some little time looking at the coffin after it was lowered, and the\r\nclergyman slipped away, unobserved even by his dog. An hour after, as he\r\nsat at dinner with his friends, his sexton requested to speak with him.\r\nHe was admitted into the room, when he said it was impossible to close\r\nthe grave, and that he did not know what to do. \"Why?\" asked the\r\ngentleman, \"Because Sir, your terrier stands there, and flies so\r\nfiercely at us whenever we attempt to throw a spade full in, that we\r\ndare not go on.\" One of the house servants was sent to the churchyard,\r\nand there saw the dog in a perfect fury, defending the grave; she\r\nrefused to come to his call, so by main force he removed her, and\r\ncarried her to the drawing-room. There, the moment she saw her master,\r\nher transport of joy equalled her former fury; and it is supposed that,\r\nnot seeing her master go away, and missing him, she fancied he was in\r\nthe grave, and thus strove to protect him from injury.\r\n\r\nThe same dog and a companion, equally faithful and sagacious, attached\r\nthemselves to their master's horse, and whenever they could, went out\r\nwith it. He rode out on it to dinner, the two dogs with him, who went\r\ncontentedly into the stable with their friend. He ordered his horse when\r\nit was time to go away; but as it was a long while coming to the door,\r\ninquiries were made about the delay, upon which the groom appeared, and\r\nsaid he dared not take the horse out of the stable, for one of the\r\nclergyman's dogs was on its back, and the other by its side, flying at\r\nevery person who came near the animal. The owner comprehended the\r\nmystery, and going to the stable himself, brought forth the steed: the\r\ngroom was a stranger, and the dogs dared not trust him with their\r\nmaster's property.\r\n\r\nA terrier, known to Professor Owen, was taught to play at hide and seek\r\nwith his master, who summoned him, by saying \"Let us have a game,\" upon\r\nwhich the dog immediately hid his eyes between his paws, in the most\r\nhonourable manner, and when the gentleman had placed a sixpence, or a\r\npiece of cake in a most improbable place, he started up and invariably\r\nfound it. His powers were equalled by what was called a Fox-terrier,\r\nnamed Fop, who would hide his eyes, and suffer those at play with him to\r\nconceal themselves before he looked up. If his playfellow hid himself\r\nbehind a window curtain, Fop would, for a certain time, carefully pass\r\nthat curtain, and look behind all the others, behind doors, etc., and\r\nwhen he thought he had looked long enough, seize the concealing curtain\r\nand drag it aside in triumph. The drollest thing, however, was to see\r\nhim take his turn of hiding; he would get under a chair, and fancy that\r\nhe was not seen; of course, those at play with him pretended not to see\r\nhim, and it was most amusing to witness his agitation as they passed.\r\nWhen he was ill he had been cured by some homoeopathic globules, and ever\r\nafter, if anything were the matter with him, he would stand near the\r\nmedicine box, and hold his mouth open.\r\n\r\nA black and tan terrier, belonging to a linen-draper in Swindon,\r\ndirectly the shop was opened in the morning, was in the habit of going\r\nto the post-office with his master; the letter bag was put into his\r\nmouth, and he carried it home. One morning he took it into his head to\r\nprecede his master, and go alone. The post-master, on seeing him, felt\r\nso certain his owner was at the door, that he delivered the bag to him,\r\nwith which he ran home while his master was seeking him. From that time\r\nit became his regular duty to fetch the letters daily.\r\n\r\nSir Walter Scott tells us of the remarkable comprehension of human\r\nlanguage evinced by his Bull-dog terrier, called Camp. He understood so\r\nmany words, that Sir Walter felt convinced an intercourse with dumb\r\nanimals might be enlarged. Camp once, bit the baker, for which Sir\r\nWalter beat him, and, at the same time, explained the enormity of the\r\noffence; after which, to the last moment of his life, he never heard the\r\nleast allusion to the story, in whatever voice or tone it might be\r\nmentioned, without getting up and retiring into the darkest corner of\r\nthe room, with great appearance of distress. Then, if it were said that\r\nthe baker had been well paid, or that the baker was not hurt after all,\r\nCamp came forward, capered, barked, and rejoiced. When he was unable,\r\ntowards the end of his life, to attend his master in his rides, he\r\nwatched for his return, and the servant used to tell him Sir Walter was\r\ncoming down the hill, or through the moor, Camp never mistook him,\r\nalthough he did not use any gesture, but either went out at the front to\r\nascend the hills, or at the back to get at the moor side.\r\n\r\nThese anecdotes, taken from many others concerning Terriers, cannot be\r\nbetter ended than by some concerning a Russian terrier. As I once was\r\nacquainted with an inimitable monkey, named Jack, so do I now know an\r\ninimitable dog of that name. He is small, white, with some quaintly\r\nplaced dark brown spots on the body and head; his eyes are of the most\r\nbrilliant black, he is slightly and genteelly made, and he has a\r\nquantity of curling hair on his back only, which gives him a peculiar\r\nappearance. He formerly resided in Ireland with the mother of his\r\npresent possessor, to whom he evinced that devoted attachment which\r\nought to be named canine, for there is nothing equal to it in any other\r\nanimal. This lady was ill for some years before her death, and could\r\nonly take exercise in an invalid chair. When she was ready to go out,\r\nshe would say, \"Now, Jack, I am ready for the chair,\" upon which he\r\nimmediately scampered off to the stables, placed himself in the vehicle,\r\nand was dragged to the door. Then he got out till his mistress was\r\nplaced comfortably in it, when he seated himself at her feet. If they\r\nwent through the garden, the carriage was stopped at Jack's favourite\r\nbeds of flowers, for he had a remarkable fancy, like a cat, to enjoy\r\ntheir perfume; mignonette being always a source of delight. On one\r\noccasion, in Dublin, he was lost; sought for, and met in the arms of a\r\npoliceman, who was carrying him home. The man said he had actually\r\ndelivered himself up at the station, for he came into the room where\r\nseveral men were seated, looked at one of them, as he stood at his feet,\r\nand quietly suffered his collar to be inspected and himself taken up and\r\ncarried.\r\n\r\nHe entered the drawing-room where his two mistresses were sitting, and\r\nmade signs for one of them to go to the door. She did not heed his\r\nrequest; upon which he pulled her gown with his teeth, and she, thinking\r\nhe must have some extraordinary reason for it, then followed him; the\r\ninstant she opened the door wide, he squatted himself in the middle of\r\nthe mat placed there, thumping the floor with his tail; before him lay\r\nsix dead rats, which he had killed and brought to be seen, they being\r\nlaid out, rat fashion, in due form, and he displaying his prowess with\r\ngreat pleasure. Jack went to Torquay with his young mistress, where he\r\nwas one day lying in the balcony, enjoying the sea breezes. An Italian\r\ncame past with his organ, and a monkey; he stopped before Jack, and\r\nsuffered his monkey to climb the pillars which supported the balcony and\r\nenter. Jack never tamely suffered the intrusion of strangers; but such a\r\nstranger as this was beyond all patience; he seized him, shook him; the\r\npoor monkey squealed, the Italian bawled out for his companion, and\r\nJack's mistress rushed to the window and rescued the unfortunate\r\ncreature, just time enough to save him from Jack's final gripe. Some\r\ndays after this, Jack was walking out with his mistress's brother, who\r\nwas a great invalid, when the sound of an organ saluted his ears. In one\r\nmoment he came up with it, seized the accompanying monkey between his\r\nteeth, and dashed past his astonished master, with the hind legs of the\r\ncreature hanging out on one side, and the feathered hat on the other. In\r\nvain did the gentleman call; Jack either did not hear or did not heed;\r\nhe took his way to the stable where his master's horse was kept, and\r\nwould have immolated the monkey, had not the grooms there saved him from\r\ndeath. The invalid and the owner of the monkey arrived at the same\r\nmoment, each delighted at the safety of the poor victim. Jack, to this\r\nday, cannot endure an organ or a monkey.\r\n\r\nThe Pariah dogs of India, when wild, occupy the woods in numerous packs;\r\nthey have long backs, pointed ears, sharp noses, and fringed tails.\r\nTheir fondness for human beings is very remarkable; and they will attach\r\nthemselves to a stranger, and not suffer any ill-usage to keep them at a\r\ndistance. One was known to follow a gentleman travelling in a palanquin\r\ntill he dropped from fatigue. There is a minute variety, white, with\r\nlong silky hair, like a lap dog, and this is trained to carry flambeaux\r\nand lanterns. Bishop Heber gives an account of a poor Pariah dog, who\r\nfollowed him during a part of his journey through India. He ordered the\r\ncook to give him some scraps, and the animal strongly attached himself\r\nto the bishop. When the party were obliged to cross a rapid river, at\r\nrather a dangerous ford, the dog was so frightened at the black roaring\r\nwater, that he sat down by the side and howled piteously, as the bishop\r\nwent over. He, however, assumed courage to follow; but was again\r\ndistressed when one of the Sepoys was missing; he ran back to the spot,\r\nand howled, returned to the bishop, then back to summon the defaulter,\r\nand continued this till the man had rejoined his party.\r\n\r\nThe bishop relates a story of one of these dogs who, being in search of\r\nwater, thrust his head into an earthen jar, and could not get it out\r\nagain; he rushed about in all directions, bellowing and howling in the\r\nmost fearful manner. The guard sprang to their feet, and stood prepared\r\nto encounter an enemy, whose approach they thought was announced by the\r\nblast of a war-horn. Halters were broken, and horses and mules pranced\r\nover the tent ropes; and it was some minutes before the cause of this\r\nconfusion was ascertained.\r\n\r\nA massive form, arched skull, deep lower jaw, strong legs and neck,\r\nsemi-hanging ears, truncated tail, and frequent presence of a fifth toe,\r\ndistinguish the noble Mastiff. They are silent, phlegmatic dogs,\r\nconscious of their own strength, seem to consider themselves more as\r\ncompanions than servants, are resolute, and face danger with the utmost\r\nself-possession. A cold region, such as the highest ranges of Central\r\nAsia, is best adapted to their perfect development, and yet their only\r\nwild type is met with in Africa. They are old denizens of Great Britain,\r\nand are said to have been brought here before the Romans conquered the\r\ncountry. They are not supposed to have come originally from Africa, but\r\nfrom Thibet, through the north of Europe.\r\n\r\nThey have been known to conquer lions; and yet, while they possess the\r\nmost indomitable strength and courage, they are the gentlest of animals,\r\nsuffering children to sit upon them, pull them roughly, and small dogs\r\nto snap and snarl at them. Confinement alone disturbs their temper. They\r\nare excellent guardians, and such is their deliberate coolness, that\r\nthey have been known to walk quietly by the side of a thief without\r\ndoing him an injury, merely preventing his escape. They will, however,\r\nsuffer the rogue to go away, if he has not already purloined anything.\r\n\r\nIt is well known that dogs love to be in a crowd of people, and this is\r\nfrequently the temptation for them to enter churches. A number of dogs,\r\nin a village of Bohemia, had followed this practice, including an\r\nEnglish mastiff, belonging to a nobleman who lived there. A magistrate\r\nwho presided at a Court, observed upon it, and said, in an authoritative\r\nvoice, \"No dogs shall be allowed to go to church, let me not see one\r\nthere in future.\" The mastiff was present, and seemed to listen with\r\nattention, not without effect, for on the ensuing Sunday, he, rising\r\nearly, ran barking at the village dogs, took his station near the door\r\nof the church, killed the only dog that ventured in, notwithstanding\r\nthe prohibition; and always posted himself as a sentinel on duty, before\r\nthe church, but without ever afterwards entering it.\r\n\r\nAn English gentleman, some time ago, went to some public gardens, at St.\r\nGermain, with a large mastiff, who was refused admittance, and the\r\ngentleman left him in the care of the bodyguards, who were placed there.\r\nThe Englishman, some time after he had entered, returned to the gate,\r\nand informed the guards that he had lost his watch, telling the\r\nsergeant, that if he would permit him to take in the dog, he would soon\r\ndiscover the thief. His request being granted, the gentleman made signs\r\nto the dog of what he had lost, who immediately ran about among the\r\ncompany, and traversed the gardens, till at last he laid hold of a man.\r\nThe gentleman insisted that this person had his watch; and, on being\r\nsearched, not only his watch, but six others, were discovered in his\r\npockets. What is more remarkable, the dog took his master's watch from\r\nthe other six, and carried it to him. This is rather an old story, but\r\nit is an excellent example of the sagacity of the mastiff.\r\n\r\nThe following anecdote has been sent to me while writing the above, by\r\nthe gentleman who witnessed the occurrence, and, as Glaucous was half a\r\nmastiff, I insert it in this place:--\r\n\r\n\"An Irish gentleman, possessed a couple of immense dogs, male and\r\nfemale, half Newfoundland, half mastiff, which were celebrated for\r\ntheir sagacity, courage, and high-training. They were, in the most\r\ncomprehensive sense, amphibious, and their home being near the sea, they\r\nspent many hours daily in the water.\r\n\r\n\"One day a young gentleman, related to the owner of these dogs, and to\r\nwhom the male, who was called Glaucous, had attached himself with the\r\nardent affection so characteristic of his species, was walking on the\r\nshore with him. It was nearly low water, and a sand-bank, covered during\r\nhigh tide, was visible at some hundred yards distance from the shore.\r\nHis attention was drawn to this object, from the circumstance of the\r\nwater being in a state of commotion around it, while the sea elsewhere\r\nwas perfectly placid. On further examination, he discovered that some\r\nlarge fish was chasing a shoal of whiting, and in his eagerness to\r\ncapture his prey, he more than once ran on the sand-bank.\r\n\r\n\"Directing the dog's attention to these objects, he was encouraged to\r\nswim to the sand-bank, which he soon attained, and he had not been there\r\na minute, before the large fish made another dash almost under his nose.\r\nThe dog immediately pursued the fish; and ere it had reached the deep\r\nwater he seized it by the shoulders, and bore it to the sand-bank. The\r\nfish, however, remained far from passive under such treatment, for as\r\nsoon as it was released, it opened its large jaws, and bit the dog so\r\nfiercely as to cause his muzzle to be crimsoned with blood.\r\n\r\n\"A few struggles brought the fish again into his own element, in which\r\nhe quickly disappeared. But the dog, though severely bitten, was not\r\ndiscomfited. A cheering call from his young friend, was followed by his\r\ndashing into the water after his finny foe, and diving, he reappeared\r\nwith the fish trailing from his jaws. Again he bore him to the\r\nsand-bank, and again the fish made good use of his teeth.\r\n\r\n\"But it was evident that the struggle could not be much longer\r\ncontinued. Availing himself of every opportunity, the dog used his\r\npowerful tusks with terrible effect on the fish's shoulders, and at\r\nlast, taking a good gripe of his prey, he set off for the shore. When\r\nabout halfway, the fish managed to break loose, but Glaucous was too\r\nquick for him, and once more seizing him, he landed his prize with all\r\nthe apparent triumph evinced by a veteran angler, who secures a monster\r\nsalmon after a lengthy battle. The fish turned out to be a hake; it\r\nweighed seventeen pounds, and when opened was found completely filled\r\nwith whitings.\"\r\n\r\nThe Bull-dog, with his truncated nose, his broad mouth, red eyelids,\r\nlarge head, forehead sinking between the eyes, nose rising, under-jaw\r\nprojecting, often showing the teeth, and thick make, has not those\r\noutward characters which compose beauty.\r\n\r\nTheir heads have always black about them; but the rest is brindled,\r\nbuff, ochry, or white. They are said to be less sagacious than other\r\ndogs, and less capable of attachment; but their great strength, their\r\ncourage, and extreme pertinacity in keeping hold when they have once\r\ntaken a gripe, makes them most valuable for completing the packs of\r\nhounds trained to hunt boars, wolves, and still larger animals. When\r\nexcited they are terrific in appearance, and were formerly used for\r\nbull-baiting in this country. In Spain and Corsica, where this practice\r\nis still continued, they may be seen in all their strength and power. I\r\nhave been told they are gentle when not engaged in their cruel sport.\r\n\r\nThe Pug has been by some considered as a variety of the bull-dog, and\r\nothers reject this opinion. His round head, grotesquely abbreviated\r\nmuzzle, and small, tightly curled tail, they think, entitling him to a\r\nplace of his own among dogs. Authorities state that he is a cross,\r\nill-tempered little dog, but my own experience contradicts this. The two\r\nwith whom I have come in frequent contact, have been remarkably playful\r\nand good-natured. One was the pet of a lady; and his bringing up ought\r\nto have made him gentlemanly; but he had several low tricks in the\r\neating way; such as stealing from the scullery, which used to provoke\r\nhis mistress. His place for hiding the purloined dainties was under the\r\npillow of her bed, and frequently at her nightly examination of the\r\nspot, she found, not only bones, but dead mice.\r\n\r\nPug number two, was a very clever fellow, who used to walk out by\r\nhimself every day, and when he wished to re-enter the house, he always\r\nrang the door bell; either by shaking the wire with his paw, or taking\r\nit between his teeth. He was clever in fetching what was wanted from\r\ndistant parts of the house, but was very much afraid of being by himself\r\nin the dark. He had formed a great friendship with a kitten, and the two\r\nused to bask together before the fire. If Pug were told to fetch some\r\narticle from the bed-room, after the house was closed for the night, he\r\ninsisted on having puss's companionship. If she were unwilling to move,\r\nhe dragged her along with his mouth, and frequently mounted several\r\nstairs with her, before she gave consent to the proceeding.\r\n\r\nMultitudes of anecdotes exist, which have been handed down to us, as\r\nrelating to dogs, without any information of the species of the\r\nprincipal actors, as in the following instances.\r\n\r\nThe fire dog, only just dead, was to be seen at almost every\r\nconflagration in London, either mounted on the engine, or tearing along\r\nby its side, seeming to think his presence necessary on all such\r\noccasions. He was well known at all the engine stations, though he did\r\nnot belong to, or derive his support from any individual. There is now a\r\ndog, at the Temple, which belongs to the inn, and not to any one\r\nperson; he is a mongrel, is fed wherever he chooses to ask, and is to\r\nbe seen everywhere within the precincts of the place. Dogs have\r\nfrequently been known to attach themselves to regiments, in the same\r\nmanner. One named Battalion, belonged to the first regiment of Royal\r\nGuards in France. Being always stationed at the guard-house, he remained\r\nthere. The frequent change of masters was of no importance to him; he\r\ndid not even go to the barracks; and considered himself as the property\r\nof twelve soldiers, two corporals, a sergeant, and a drummer, whoever\r\nthey might happen to be; but if the regiment changed garrison, he\r\ninstalled himself at the new guard-house. He never took any notice of\r\nthose who did not wear the same uniform.\r\n\r\nThe histories of the smuggling dogs on the frontiers of France, are well\r\nknown, but these smugglers are now almost all destroyed. The extent to\r\nwhich this illicit commerce was carried, was enormous. Dogs notions of\r\nproperty, however, are often very scrupulous; a lady at Bath found her\r\nway impeded as she walked by a dog, who had discovered the loss of her\r\nveil, though she had not; the animal had left his own master to seek it\r\nfor her; he found it, and then returned to his owner. They often shew a\r\npresentiment of danger, and gave notice of the earthquake at Gabaluasco\r\nin 1835, by leaving the town, also at Concepcion, in the same manner.\r\n\r\nSome dogs have a great antipathy to music, others only to certain tones,\r\nand I have known a dog who always set up a howl at particular passages.\r\nThere was one who, before the great revolution in France, used to march\r\nwith the band at the Thuileries because he liked it, and at night\r\nfrequented the opera and other theatres.\r\n\r\nThe most surprising histories told of dogs are concerning their speech.\r\nLiebnitz reported to the French Academy of Sciences, that a dog had been\r\ntaught to modulate his voice, so that he could distinctly ask for\r\ncoffee, tea, and chocolate. After this we may believe that a dog was\r\nlearning to say Elizabeth. I have often watched for such sounds, from\r\nenergetic, clever dogs, who have evidently tried _viva voce_ to make me\r\nacquainted with some circumstance, but never heard anything\r\nintelligible, and I cannot imagine that the organs of speech are\r\nbestowed upon a favoured few; without which the articulation of words\r\nmust be impossible.\r\n\r\nVolumes might be filled with these anecdotes of dogs, but I will here\r\nconclude my list with the picture given by Mr. St. John of his pets,\r\nportraying a happiness which contrasts strongly with the miserable\r\ncondition of many ill-used animals, belonging to hard-hearted masters,\r\nwho perform valuable services, and are yet kicked, spurned, or\r\nhalf-starved.\r\n\r\n\"Opposite the window of the room I am in at present,\" says this\r\ngentleman, \"are a monkey and five dogs basking in the sun, a\r\nblood-hound, a Skye terrier, a setter, a Russian poodle, and a young\r\nNewfoundland, who is being educated as a retriever. They all live in\r\ngreat friendship with the monkey, who is now in the most absurd manner\r\nsearching the poodle's coat for fleas, lifting up curl by curl, and\r\nexamining the roots of the hair. Occasionally, if she thinks that she\r\nhas pulled the hair, or lifted one of his legs rather too roughly, she\r\nlooks the dog in the face with an inquiring expression to see if he be\r\nangry. The dog, however, seems rather to enjoy the operation, and,\r\nshowing no symptoms of displeasure, the monkey continues her search; and\r\nwhen she sees a flea, catches it in the most active manner, looks at it\r\nfor a moment, and then eats it with great relish. Having exhausted the\r\ngame on the poodle, she jumps on the back of the blood-hound, and having\r\nlooked into her face to see how she will bear it, begins a new search,\r\nbut, finding nothing, goes off for a game at romps with the Newfoundland\r\ndog. While the blood-hound, hearing the voice of one of the children, to\r\nwhom she has taken a particular fancy, walks off to the nursery. The\r\nsetter lies dozing and dreaming of grouse; while the little terrier sits\r\nwith ears pricked up, listening to any sounds of dog or man that she\r\nmay hear; occasionally she trots off on three legs to look at the back\r\ndoor of the house, for fear any rat-hunt, or fun of that sort may take\r\nplace without her being invited. Why do Highland terriers so often run\r\non three legs, particularly when bent on any mischief? Is it to keep one\r\nin reserve in case of emergencies? I never had a Highland terrier who\r\ndid not hop along constantly on three legs, keeping one of the hind legs\r\nup as if to give it rest.\"\r\n\r\nA proof of the sudden attachments which dogs will form, is given by Mr.\r\nMurray, to whom the dog of his guide took a fancy. Mr. Murray passed the\r\nnight in the house of his master, fed him, and the animal sat looking up\r\nin his face. The next morning the party started on foot to cross the\r\nPyrenees, and when the guide had fulfilled his agreement and received\r\nhis reward, he took his leave; the dog, however, followed Mr. Murray,\r\nand no threats or entreaties could prevail on him to turn back. He\r\nproceeded to an inn with his new friend, and Mr. Murray was making a\r\nbargain with the innkeeper to send the dog to his owner, when a boy came\r\nfrom the man, to claim the beast. He followed the boy two or three times\r\nfor a few yards, and invariably returned. A strong cord was then tied\r\nround his neck, and the boy was told to lead him with that; but at a\r\nlittle distance, finding that he could not get rid of the cord, the dog\r\nleaped upon the boy, threw him down, dragged the cord out of his hand,\r\nand returned to Mr. Murray. After this it seemed inevitable that they\r\nshould travel together. Mr. Murray sent for the master, bought the dog,\r\nand eventually took him to Scotland, having a place secured for him\r\nalways in the diligence; and from the moment he arrived, he became the\r\npet of the family.\r\n\r\nAnother instance of the same feeling in dogs, occurred to a sporting\r\ntraveller in Norway (Mr. Lloyd, if I mistake not) to whom the dog of a\r\npeasant took the same sudden liking.\r\n\r\n[4] Boyle.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWOLVES.\r\n\r\n\r\nStrong, gaunt, ferocious, cunning, cowardly, and sinister-looking,\r\nwolves (Canis Lupus) still inhabit the forest and mountainous districts\r\nof Europe, Asia, and America; a few being occasionally met with in\r\nplains. Happily they have been extirpated from Great Britain and\r\nIreland, but in many parts of populous countries on the European\r\nContinent, an unusually severe winter brings them to the habitations of\r\nman.\r\n\r\nTheir resemblance to dogs, internally and externally, has led to the\r\nsupposition, that they were the original parents of the latter; but I\r\nhave elsewhere alluded to this unsettled question.\r\n\r\nThe muscles of the head, neck, and shoulders of wolves, are extremely\r\npowerful, and the snap with which they bite is never to be mistaken,\r\nbeing apparently peculiar to them. They drink by suction, and it is\r\nsaid, that if the offspring which they have by a dog, should lap, they\r\ntake a dislike to it. The cry which they make is not a regular bark, but\r\na hoarse, ugly noise, and the howl which they delight in setting up at\r\nnight, is one of the most melancholy sounds possible. They vary much in\r\ncolour, being white, black, grey, brown, etc. Their digitigrade walk,\r\nsharp muzzle, oblique eyes, and hanging tail, in their wild state, are\r\nless conspicuous in domestication, and they then gradually assimilate\r\nthemselves in appearance to our hounds.\r\n\r\nInnumerable are the true histories which have been transmitted to us\r\nconcerning wolves. Their nightly prowling, their quiet, untiring\r\nperseverance in pursuit, their skulking disposition, their artful\r\nstratagems, all impart a mystery to them which has been heightened by\r\nfear, and the natural proneness of man to magnify tales of horror.\r\n\r\nWolves are too suspicious to be often taken in traps; and when pursued\r\nthey run with their noses almost touching the ground, their eyes glowing\r\nlike fire, the hair of their head and neck bristled up, their tail drawn\r\nclose to their legs. Their usual height at the shoulders is about two\r\nfeet and a half; their young are born in caverns or gloomy recesses, and\r\nthe female wolf is furious in their defence. They often fight with each\r\nother; and it is said, if a wounded wolf come among his fellows, he is\r\nimmediately torn in pieces and devoured.\r\n\r\nMr. Lloyd, in his \"Field Sports in the North of Europe,\" tells us of a\r\npeasant who, in the neighbourhood of St. Petersburgh, met with the\r\nfollowing narrow escape:--\"He was pursued by eleven of these ferocious\r\nanimals, while he was in his sledge. At this time he was only about two\r\nmiles from home, towards which he urged his horse at the very top of his\r\nspeed. At the entrance of his residence was a gate, which happened to be\r\nclosed at the time; but the horse dashed this open, and thus his master\r\nand himself found refuge in the courtyard. They were followed, however,\r\nby nine out of the eleven wolves; but very fortunately, at the very\r\ninstant these had entered the enclosure, the gate swung back on its\r\nhinges, and thus they were caught as in a trap. From being the most\r\nferocious of animals, now that they found escape impossible, they\r\ncompletely changed, and so far from offering molestation to any one,\r\nthey slunk into holes and corners, and allowed themselves to be\r\nslaughtered, almost without making resistance.\"\r\n\r\nA more tragic occurrence happened to an unfortunate woman, also in\r\nRussia, and is related by the same gentleman:--\"A woman, accompanied by\r\nthree of her children, was one day in a sledge, when they were pursued\r\nby a number of wolves. She put the horse into a gallop, and drove\r\ntowards her home with the utmost speed. She was not far from it; but\r\nthe ferocious animals gained upon her, and were on the point of rushing\r\non to the sledge. For the preservation of her own life, and that of the\r\nremaining children, the poor, frantic creature cast one of them to her\r\nblood-thirsty pursuers. This stopped their career for a moment; but,\r\nafter devouring the poor child, they renewed the pursuit, and a second\r\ntime came up with the vehicle. The mother, driven to desperation,\r\nresorted to the same horrible expedient, and threw another of her\r\noffspring to her ferocious assailants. The third child was also\r\nsacrificed in the same way, and soon after, the wretched being reached\r\nher home in safety. Here she related what had happened, and endeavoured\r\nto palliate her own conduct, by describing the dreadful alternative to\r\nwhich she had been reduced. A peasant, however, who was among the\r\nbystanders, and heard the recital, took up an axe, and with one blow\r\ncleft her skull in two, saying, at the same time, 'that a mother who\r\ncould thus sacrifice her children for the preservation of her own life,\r\nwas no longer fit to live.' The man was committed to prison, but the\r\nEmperor subsequently granted him a pardon.\"\r\n\r\nThe tame wolf at the Jardin des Plantes, is described by M. Frederic\r\nCuvier, in the following manner:--\"This animal was brought up as a young\r\ndog, became familiar with every person whom he was in the habit of\r\nseeing, and in particular followed his master everywhere, evincing\r\nchagrin at his absence, obeying his voice, and showing a degree of\r\nsubmission, scarcely differing in any respect from that of the most\r\nthoroughly domesticated dog. His master being obliged to be absent for a\r\ntime, presented his pet to the Jardin des Plantes, where the animal,\r\nconfined in a den, continued disconsolate, and would scarcely take his\r\nfood. At length, however, his health returned; he became attached to his\r\nkeepers, and appeared to have forgotten all his former affection; when,\r\nafter eighteen months, his master returned. At the first word he\r\nuttered, the wolf, who had not perceived him among the crowd, recognized\r\nhim, exhibited the most lively joy, and, being set at liberty, lavished\r\non his old friend the most affectionate caresses. A second separation\r\nand return was followed by similar demonstrations of sorrow, which,\r\nhowever, again yielded to time. Three years had passed, and the wolf was\r\nliving happily in company with a dog, when his master again returned,\r\nand the still remembered voice was instantly replied to by the most\r\nimpatient cries, which were redoubled as soon as the poor fellow was at\r\nliberty, when, rushing to his master, he threw his fore-feet on his\r\nshoulders, licking his face with every mark of the most lively joy, and\r\nmenacing his keepers, who offered to remove him, and towards whom, not a\r\nmoment before, he had been showing every mark of fondness. A third\r\nseparation, however, seemed to be too much for this faithful animal's\r\ntemper; he became gloomy, desponding, refused his food, and for a long\r\ntime his life appeared to be in danger. His health, however, returned;\r\nbut he no longer suffered the caresses of any but his keepers, and\r\ntowards strangers manifested the original savageness of his species.\"\r\n\r\nThere was another wolf at the same Menagerie, who was very docile and\r\naffectionate, distinguishing those whom he knew from strangers, and\r\nseeking their caresses. We were very good friends, and I often played\r\nwith him, so that he knew my voice. After an absence of two years, to my\r\ngreat surprise, he recognized it, dashed to the bars of the den, thrust\r\nhis paws out to greet me, and gave every sign of delight. It is\r\nprobable, that this circumstance, combined with another, may have given\r\nrise to the history related by Captain Brown, in his \"Popular Natural\r\nHistory,\" of which I now beg to give a correct version:--\"Mme. Ducrest\r\n[then Mlle. Duvaucel] and I were going out at Baron Cuvier's front door,\r\nwhen a man, holding something tied up in a handkerchief, asked if we\r\nbelonged to the house. On replying in the affirmative, he offered his\r\nbundle; she shrank from it, as the same thing had occurred to me a few\r\ndays before, and I received the dried and tattooed head of a New\r\nZealander; but he opened the handkerchief, and displayed a beautiful\r\nlittle wolf puppy, covered with silky black hair. She joyfully received\r\nit; we carried it to the keepers of the Menagerie, and orders were given\r\nthat it might be fed on soup and cooked meat. The wolf continued to be\r\nvery handsome, very playful, and very tame for about a year, when she\r\nbecame a mother, and from that time was savage and unsociable to human\r\nbeings, never recovering her former amiable disposition. She was from\r\nthe Pyrenees.\"\r\n\r\nThe following story is told by a gentleman who was sporting in Hungary\r\nat the time the circumstance occurred:--\"About dusk, just as the last\r\nsledge had arrived within a quarter of a mile of a village on the way\r\nhomeward, and had cleared the corner of a wood which had bounded the\r\nroad at a few yards distance for a considerable length; the owner, who\r\nwas seated behind, with his back to the horses, espied a wolf rush out\r\nof the angle of the wood, and give chase to the sledge at the top of his\r\nspeed. The man shouted to the boy who was driving, 'Farkas! farkas!' (a\r\nwolf! a wolf!). Itze het! itze het! (drive on),' and the lad, looking\r\nround in terror, beheld the animal just clearing the gripe which ran\r\nalong the road they had passed. Quick as lightning, with shout and whip,\r\nand with all his might, he urged the horses to gain the village. Away\r\nthey flew at their fullest stretch, as if sensible of the danger behind\r\nthem, conveyed to them by the exclamation of the lad, and the dreaded\r\nname of the animal which he shouted in their ears. The man turned his\r\nseat and urged the boy still more energetically to lash the horses to\r\ntheir very utmost speed. He did not need any further incentive, but\r\npushed on the nags with frantic exertion. The sledge flew over the\r\nslippery road with fearful speed; but the wolf urged yet more his utmost\r\npace, and gained fast upon it. The village was distant about two hundred\r\nyards below the brow of the hill; nothing but the wildest pace could\r\nsave them, and the man felt that the wolf would inevitably spring upon\r\nthem before they could get to the bottom. Both shouted wildly as they\r\npursued their impetuous career, the sledge swerving frightfully from one\r\nside of the road to the other, and threatening every moment to turn\r\nover. The man then drew his thick bunda (sheep-skin) over his head; he\r\nlooked behind and saw the fierce, panting beast within a few yards of\r\nhim; he thought he felt his hot breath in his face; he ensconced his\r\nhead again in his bunda, and, in another moment, the wolf sprang upon\r\nhis back, and gripped into the thick sheep skin that covered his neck.\r\nWith admirable presence of mind the bold-hearted peasant now threw up\r\nboth his hands, and grasping the wolf's head and neck with all his\r\nstrength, hugged him with an iron clutch to his shoulders. 'Itze het,'\r\nnow shouted the cool fellow, and holding his enemy in a death grip,\r\nthey swept into the village, dragging the fierce brute after them, in\r\nspite of his frantic efforts to disengage himself. The shouts of the boy\r\nand man, with the mad speed and noise of the horses, brought the\r\nvillagers out to see what was the matter. 'Farkas! farkas!' shouted\r\nboth, and the peasants immediately seeing their perilous position, gave\r\nchase with their axes, calling out to the man to hold on bravely. At\r\nlength the boy succeeded in slackening the speed of the animals, the\r\nsledge stopped, and the peasants, rushing on, dispatched the ferocious\r\ncreature upon the man's back, whose arms were so stiffened with the\r\nimmense muscular exertion he had so long maintained, that he could\r\nhardly loose them from the neck of the dead wolf.\"\r\n\r\nAn unfortunate clergyman, in the neighbourhood of Eauxbonnes in the\r\nBasses Pyrenees, was not as fortunate as the Slovack peasant; for, as he\r\nwas returning from visiting the sick in January, 1830, he was beset by\r\nhungry wolves, and torn to pieces by them; the fragments which they\r\nleft, and the blood upon the snow, alone telling his fate.\r\n\r\nThe North American wolves are not as gaunt as those of Europe, having\r\nshorter legs, thicker fur, shorter muzzle, broader heads, more bushy\r\ntail, and being altogether more compact. Their habits, however, are much\r\nthe same, A farmer in New Hampshire was one night awakened by a noise\r\nin his hog-pen; on looking out he saw, what he supposed to be a fox, on\r\nthe low, sloping roof of the sty. He went out, but found that the animal\r\nwas a grey wolf, which, instead of making off, fiercely attacked him,\r\nrushing down the roof towards him; and before the man had time to move\r\nback, the wolf had bitten his arm three times, with his quick and\r\nrepeated snaps, lacerating it from the elbow to the wrist; then,\r\nhowever, he leaped from the roof to the ground, and by so doing lost his\r\nadvantage; for the man succeeded in seizing him on each side of the neck\r\nwith his hands, and held him firmly in that position till his wife, whom\r\nhe called out, came up with a large butcher's knife, and cut the beast's\r\nthroat. It was three months before the man's arm was healed; every\r\nincision, it was said, piercing to the bone.[5]\r\n\r\nA white wolf always attends the bull, called buffalo, of Western\r\nAmerica; besides which the same country affords other varieties. Among\r\nthem are the Coyotes, or Medicine Wolves, of the Indians, who show them\r\ngreat reverence. They are small, sagacious, and cunning; assemble in\r\npacks, and hunt in troops of from three to thirty, along the runs of\r\ndeer and antelopes, and run down their quarry. When game has been killed\r\nby hunters, they sit patiently at a short distance, while larger wolves\r\nprowl around, pouncing on the pieces thrown to them by the men, and\r\nwhich the small ones drop instantly. They keep watch round a camp at\r\nnight, and gnaw the skin ropes of horses and cattle.\r\n\r\nWhen the Coyotes, or small white wolves, of Mexico, lose all hope of\r\nescape, they curl themselves up and await death. If impelled by hunger,\r\none snatches a piece from the hunter, while he cuts up his game, the\r\nwhole herd rush upon it, fight, growl, and tear each other for it. Mr.\r\nRyan, from whose lively descriptions these notices are taken, was for\r\ndays followed by a large grey wolf, and every evening when he encamped,\r\nthe wolf squatted himself down, and helped himself whenever he could.\r\nSomething, however, was generally left for him; and he became so tame,\r\nthat he stopped when the party stopped, and when anything was killed,\r\nwalked round and round, licking his jaws in expectation of his share. No\r\none ever molested him, and, therefore, he continued quite harmless. This\r\nsort of proceeding will sometimes take place with a whole pack.\r\n\r\nMr. Ruxton one day killed an old buck, and left it on the ground, where\r\nsix small wolves were in attendance. Ten minutes after he left his game,\r\nthe six wolves came up with him, one of which had his nose and face\r\nbesmeared with blood, and he seemed to be almost bursting. Thinking it\r\nimpossible they should have devoured the buck in so short a time, he had\r\nthe curiosity to return and see what impression they had made upon it,\r\nand why they had left it. To his astonishment, he found only the bones\r\nand some of the hair remaining, the flesh having been taken off as if it\r\nhad been scraped with a knife. They flourish their tails, snarl, bite,\r\nsqueak, and swallow the whole time of their meal; and if kindly treated,\r\nwill come and warm themselves by the fires of the hunters when they are\r\nasleep, and sit nodding their own heads with drowsiness.\r\n\r\nThe Esquimaux dogs, though very bold when attacking bears, are so much\r\nafraid of wolves, that they scarcely make any resistance when set upon\r\nby them. Sir John Richardson tells us, that a wolf, wounded by a\r\nmusket-ball, returned after dusk, and carried off a dog from among fifty\r\nothers, who howled piteously, but did not dare to try and rescue their\r\ncompanion.\r\n\r\nSeveral wolves will combine, and, forming a semicircle, creep slowly\r\ntowards a herd of deer, if there be a precipice near, and hemming them\r\nin gradually, so as not to alarm them suddenly, drive them to the edge\r\nof the precipice; then they all at once set up the most terrific yells,\r\nand taking flight, the poor deer leap over the precipice, where the\r\nwolves follow them at their leisure by a safer path, to feed on their\r\nmangled carcases.\r\n\r\nOn one occasion, a troop of nine white wolves endeavoured to practise\r\nthe same trick upon Sir John Richardson, evidently intending to drive\r\nhim into the river. However, when he rose up they halted, and on his\r\nadvancing, made way for him to go to the tents.\r\n\r\nThe lovers of tragic histories will find many of the most fearful kind\r\namong the legends of all countries where wolves abound; all probably\r\nfounded on fact, but mostly interwoven with romance. There cannot be\r\nanything much more shocking than that of the solitary traveller,\r\ngalloping into a village pursued by these beasts, and knocking at the\r\ndoors, earnestly entreating for refuge. The inhabitants were mostly\r\nburied in sleep; some few heard and did not move, others had a dim,\r\nconfused notion of what was passing, and also remained in their beds;\r\nwhile others again did not hear anything. The next morning the sad event\r\nwas told by finding the traveler's cloak and a few bones.\r\n\r\n[5] Gosse's Canadian Naturalist.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOXES.\r\n\r\n\r\nStealing along in the dark of evening, the cunning and rapacious Fox\r\n(Canis Vulpes) leaves his hole in the earth, and roams in search of his\r\nprey. The poultry-yards, rabbit-warrens, and the haunts of game, tell of\r\nhis skilful depredations; but he is not at all difficult in his\r\nappetite. To be sure, when he can get ripe grapes, he has a feast. If\r\nyoung turkeys and hares are not to be had, he puts up with a young\r\nfawn, a wild duck, or even weasels, mice, frogs, or insects. He will\r\nalso walk down to the sea-shore, and sup upon the remains of fishes, or\r\narrest the crabs and make them alter their sidelong course so as to\r\ncrawl down his throat. Reynard also has an eye to the future; for he\r\nnever lets anything escape which comes within his sharp bite, and as\r\nthere must be a limit to the quantity which any animal can contain, when\r\nhe cannot possibly eat any more, he, in various spots, well marked by\r\nhimself, buries the remainder for the morrow's meal. With only his toes\r\ntouching the earth, he prowls about with noiseless steps; his nose and\r\nears alive to the faintest sound or odour; his cat-like eyes, with\r\nlinear pupil, gleaming like coals of fire, and he suddenly springs upon\r\nhis victims before they are aware of his vicinity. His bushy tail is the\r\nenvied trophy of the huntsman, who calls it a brush. His colours are\r\nwhite, black, red, yellow, bluish, or variegated; and in cold climates\r\nhe always turns white in winter. The father takes no care of his\r\nchildren; but the mother performs her duty with the most exemplary\r\ndevotion for four months.\r\n\r\nThe fox is generally a solitary, suspicious animal; even when as much\r\ntamed as he can be, he seems to think he is going to be deceived and\r\nill-treated: perhaps he judges of others by himself. He lives very often\r\nin a burrow, called an earth, belonging to somebody else, for he has\r\nvery lax morals concerning property, and a great idea that right is\r\nestablished by possession. If he should be caught and put in\r\nconfinement, he is very ferocious, or dies of ennui; but he is much too\r\ncoy and clever to be easily entrapped. His cry is a sort of yelp, which,\r\nhowever, he is much too cautious to utter when he is earning his living.\r\n\r\nOccasionally the fox has been caught in a trap, and there is the history\r\nof one who escaped and left one of his fore feet behind him. After a\r\nlapse of time, his trail was to be seen in various places, and was, of\r\ncourse, easily recognized. This continued for two years, when he was\r\nchased by Mr. St. John and easily killed. Another who was unearthed by\r\nthe dogs, instead of running after the usual fashion of these beasts,\r\nturned suddenly upon each dog that came up and jumped over him. This\r\ncould not last long, although it puzzled the dogs very much; he was\r\ntaken, and then only was the reason for his manoeuvre discovered by\r\nfinding that he had only three feet.\r\n\r\nMr. St. John relates the following history of the cunning of a\r\nfox:--\"Just after it was daylight, I saw a large fox come very quietly\r\nalong the edge of the plantation; he looked with great care over the\r\nturf wall into the field, and seemed to long very much to get hold of\r\nsome of the hares that were feeding in it, but apparently knew that he\r\nhad no chance of catching one by dint of running. After considering a\r\nshort time, he seemed to have formed his plans, examined the different\r\ngaps in the wall, fixed upon one which appeared to be most frequented,\r\nand laid himself down close to it, in an attitude like that of a cat at\r\na mouse hole.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE FOX AND THE HARES.--Page 176.]\r\n\r\n\"In the meantime I watched all his plans; he then with great care and\r\nsilence scraped a small hollow in the ground, throwing up the sand as a\r\nkind of screen; every now and then, however, he stopped to listen, and\r\nsometimes to take a most cautious peep into the field. When he had done\r\nthis he laid himself down in a convenient posture for springing on his\r\nprey, and remained perfectly motionless, with the exception of an\r\noccasional reconnoiter of the feeding hares. When the sun began to rise,\r\nthey came, one by one, from the field to the plantation; three had\r\nalready come without passing by his ambush, one within twenty yards of\r\nhim, but he made no movement beyond crouching still more flatly to the\r\nground. Presently two came directly towards him, and though he did not\r\nventure to look up, I saw, by an involuntary motion of his ears, that\r\nthose quick organs had already warned him of their approach. The two\r\nhares came through the gap together, and the fox, springing with the\r\nquickness of lightning, caught one and killed her immediately; he then\r\nlifted up his booty, and was carrying it off, when my rifle-ball stopped\r\nhis course.\"\r\n\r\nIn Captain Brown's \"Popular Natural History,\" I find the following:--\"In\r\nthe autumn of the year 1819, at a fox-chase in Galloway, a very strong\r\nfox was hard run by the hounds. Finding himself in great danger of being\r\ntaken, Reynard made for a high wall at a short distance, and springing\r\nover it, crept close under the other side: the hounds followed, but no\r\nsooner had they leaped the wall, than he sprang back again over it, and\r\nby this cunning device gave them the slip, and got safe away from his\r\npursuers.\"\r\n\r\nAn American gentleman of Pittsfield, accompanied by two blood-hounds,\r\nfound a fox, and pursued him for nearly two hours, when suddenly the\r\ndogs appeared at fault. Their master came up with them near a large log\r\nof wood lying on the ground, and felt much surprise at their making a\r\ncircuit of a few roods without any object in view, every trace of the\r\nfox seeming to have been lost, while the dogs still kept yelping. On\r\nlooking about him the gentleman saw the fox stretched upon the log,\r\napparently lifeless. He made several unsuccessful efforts to direct the\r\nattention of the dogs towards the place, and at length he approached so\r\nnear as to see the animal breathe. Even then Reynard did not show any\r\nalarm; but his pursuer aimed a blow at him with the branch of a tree,\r\nupon which he leaped from his lurking-place, and was taken.\r\n\r\nOne of the drollest incidents in fox-hunting was that at Newry, in\r\nIreland, when, being pursued very hotly, the fox leaped on to the top of\r\na turf-stack, where he laid himself down quite flat. At last, one of the\r\nhounds perceived him, and he was obliged again to run. After this, he\r\nclimbed up a stone wall, whence he sprang on to the roof of a cabin near\r\nby, and mounting to the chimney top, from thence inspected his enemies.\r\nAn old hound, however, followed him, and was on the point of seizing\r\nhim, when Reynard dropped down the chimney into the lap of an old woman,\r\nwho was smoking her pipe at the corner. The hound did not dare to\r\nfollow, but the sportsmen came up, and entering the cabin, found it in\r\npossession of the fox; the frightened woman and children huddled into\r\none corner, and the fox (who was taken alive) grinning at them.\r\n\r\nIn all ages of fable, the fox has been the principal hero. The most\r\nancient fables on record, those of Lokman, the Arabian, from whom AEsop\r\ntook most of his, gives him a very conspicuous place among the crafty\r\ncourtiers of the lion. The chief phrase of which the wily flatterer\r\nmakes use, as he bows with affected humility to his sovereign, is, \"Oh,\r\nFather of Beauty,\" by which indirect compliment he generally gains his\r\nwishes. The early German writers have also chosen him as the principal\r\nhero of various histories, and the poem of \"Reynard, the Fox,\" will\r\nlive as long as printers and illustrators exercise their art and talent.\r\n\r\nThe Arctic fox is smaller than ours; even the soles of his feet are\r\ncovered with fur, like those of the hare, and he is altogether more\r\nthickly clothed. He has often been supposed to be pied in colour, but\r\nthis is only in process of turning to the hue of winter. He is in these\r\nclimates a much more gregarious animal, and several families live in the\r\nsame earth. Bishop Heber mentions one in India, which feeds chiefly on\r\nfield-mice and white ants, and this probably is the species of which the\r\nnatives say, that he can turn nine times within the space of his own\r\nlength. He is about half the size of the European.\r\n\r\nMuch valuable fur is derived both from European and American foxes,\r\nwhere there is a great variety of colour, not depending on temperature.\r\n\r\nIn Ireland there is a small animal called a fox, which does not eat\r\nflesh, but contents itself with vegetables, and is so perfectly\r\nharmless, that it roams about, unmolested even by dogs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHYAENAS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere cannot be a much more uninteresting animal than the hard-hided,\r\nknock-kneed Hyaena, which is pre-eminently African, although he is found\r\nin the East; having, according to the opinion of some naturalists,\r\nmigrated thither in the wake of caravans. He has a ferocious,\r\nill-natured look, yet the first impression made by his appearance can\r\nonly be expressed by the word \"sneaking.\" He is of a tawny colour, more\r\nor less dusky till it approaches black, and is generally spotted, or\r\nstriped. He has a mane continued all along the spine; his ears are long\r\nand erect; he is digitigrade, his claws are strong, and not retractile;\r\nhe possesses a gland which sends forth a disagreeable odour, and his\r\neyes have a pupil which is contracted at the top, and round at the\r\nbottom, which gives them a singular expression.\r\n\r\nThe great peculiarity of form in the Hyaena is the disproportionate\r\nsmallness of his hind quarters; besides which, the vertebrae of his neck\r\nvery often become stiffened, in consequence of the strain put upon them\r\nby the powerful muscles of that part, and of the jaws. So firm is the\r\nhold which they take, that nothing will make them leave what they have\r\nonce seized. They devour bones as well as muscles, rejecting only hoofs,\r\nhorns, and skull; and this power must have existed in former ages, for\r\nin the caves which they inhabited, and into which they dragged their\r\nprey, their fossil remains are found with those of gigantic mastodons,\r\netc., on which their teeth had made impression. This stiffness of the\r\nneck has caused many to imagine that it was composed of one joint only,\r\nand led the Arabs to make Hyaenas the symbols of obstinacy.\r\n\r\nThe habits of Hyaenas accord with their outward appearance; they are\r\nnature's scavengers, and feed on everything, being, with the jackal and\r\nGenet cat, the especial robbers of the cemetery. Many are the stories\r\ntold of their cruel depredations, such as their stealing into the kraals\r\nof the Caffres and Hottentots, and abstracting the sleeping infants from\r\nunder the kaross of its mother, who only becomes conscious of her loss\r\nwhen she hears the cries of the victim. Major Denham, in his travels,\r\ntells us of a village stormed by them at night, when they carried off\r\nasses and other animals.\r\n\r\nMy own impressions of the Hyaena are, that he is a timid, cowardly\r\nanimal. I always found them shun my approach; and my uncle has told me,\r\nthat when he often encountered them during his command of the outpost of\r\nTantum Querry, on the leeward coast of Africa, they invariably turned\r\nfrom him, and slunk out of sight with their dragging, shuffling gait. I\r\ncannot say that they disturbed the stillness of the night, because a\r\ntropical night never is still; but their cry used suddenly to come upon\r\nour ears, and I know not why, always seemed to be close to us. The roar\r\nof a leopard or lion is most grand, however terrific; but what is\r\ncalled the laugh of the hyaena, is just like the triumphant exultation\r\nof a fierce madman, when he reaches his long-sought victim.\r\n\r\nAll the natives of the Gold Coast bear witness to the powers of mimicry\r\nevinced by the hyaena; they say that he hides himself in the jungle, and\r\nimitates the cries of other beasts till he allures them to his side,\r\nwhen he falls upon and devours them. A gentleman, who long commanded a\r\nfortress on the Gold Coast, told me the following story, which confirms\r\nthe above assertion:--\"Some women from the neighbouring village were\r\naccustomed to pass the walls of the fort to fetch water after sunset, at\r\nthe dinner hour of this officer, and made so much noise, that they\r\ndisturbed him, so he ordered them to take another path. The next evening\r\nthe noise recurred, and the same order was repeated the next morning; on\r\nwhich the women protested they had gone quite another way. On the third\r\nevening, when the laughing and talking were apparently recommencing, a\r\nsergeant sallied forth to bring the delinquents into the fort; but to\r\nhis surprise there were only three hyaenas to be seen, whose imitation of\r\nhuman sounds had deceived all those who had heard them on the preceding\r\noccasions.\"\r\n\r\nIt was long supposed that the hyaena was incapable of attachment, but Mr.\r\nBurchell brought one with him from South Africa to this country, which\r\nevidently loved his master, and was jealous of other animals. Colonel\r\nSykes procured one in India who followed him about like a dog, played\r\nwith the sailors on board ship with the greatest good humour, and never\r\nforgot his first owner. He was placed in the Zoological Gardens, where,\r\nalthough Colonel Sykes paid him rare visits, he always recognized him\r\namidst the crowd. One day, when the hyaena was asleep, this gentleman\r\nsuddenly called him by his name; the poor beast as suddenly started on\r\nto his legs, looked up, rubbed his head against the bars of his cage,\r\nbounded about uttering short cries, looked sorrowfully at Colonel Sykes\r\nwhen he went away, and repeated these manifestations of joy when he\r\nreturned.\r\n\r\nThe Spotted Hyaena has been called the Hyaena Capensis, from the belief\r\nthat it only inhabited South Africa; but it is found as frequently in\r\nGuinea as the striped variety, and has just the same propensities. Near\r\nthe Cape, however, it does more mischief, because colonists have settled\r\nthemselves there, and their farms afford more valuable prey. They are\r\nsaid to prefer making an attack on strong, vigorous animals, because\r\nthey run away, and the hyaenas can follow them; but the weaker animals\r\nturn round and face their enemy, which always intimidates them.\r\n\r\nMr. Steedman, a South African traveller, gives an unmitigated bad\r\ncharacter to the spotted hyaenas, and says, that such is their preference\r\nfor human flesh, that they will even pass by the cattle, and seize on\r\nchildren as old as eight years.\r\n\r\nThe Straand Wolf of the Dutch, or the Villose Hyaena of Dr. Abel Smith,\r\nwho has done so much for the natural history of Southern Africa, is less\r\ncommon than the other species; and often feeds on the shore, from its\r\npreference for those dead animals which are cast up by the sea. If,\r\nhowever, it be pressed by hunger, it commits just as many depredations\r\nas the others. It is extremely cunning, conceals itself by day among the\r\nmountains, or thick patches of forest, and preys at a great distance\r\nfrom its habitation.\r\n\r\nMr. Pringle confirms Mr. Steedman's accounts of the terrible havoc\r\noccasioned by the hyaenas of South Africa, and says, that in the district\r\nof Somerset, they destroyed seventy foals in one year, belonging to the\r\nfarmers; he, however, believes, that they never attack human beings by\r\nnight or by day, and that they come in packs and play the part of\r\nfour-footed vultures, even devouring their own kindred if they should\r\nchance to be killed; but no other beast of prey will eat them, from the\r\noffensive rankness of their flesh. The den of a spotted hyaena, that was\r\nkept in the Tower about twenty years ago, required some repair. The\r\ncarpenter nailed a thick oaken plank upon the floor, about seven feet\r\nlong, putting at least a dozen nails into it, each longer than his\r\nmiddle finger. At one end of this piece of wood, there was a small\r\nprojection, and not having a proper chisel with him by which he might\r\nremove it, the man returned to his shop to fetch one. While he was\r\nabsent, some persons came to see the animals; and the hyaena was let down\r\nby the keeper into the part of the den in which the carpenter had been\r\nat work. Directly the beast saw the projecting piece of wood, he seized\r\nit with his teeth, tore the plank up, and drew out every nail with the\r\nutmost ease; which action will give a good idea of the muscular strength\r\nof this creature.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to say why there should be such conflicting accounts of\r\nthe hyaena, given by those whose veracity is undoubted. No one dreads\r\nthem on the Gold Coast, but they seem to be the terror of all the\r\ninhabitants at, and to the north of the Cape, also in Abyssinia, where\r\nBruce called them \"the plagues of their lives,\" and we can scarcely\r\nforbear a smile, when we read that one of them stood by his bed-side,\r\nwith a purloined bunch of candles in his mouth; having found his way to\r\nhim even through the streets of Gondar.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CAT TRIBE.--LIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nI must be allowed to give a somewhat more lengthened description than I\r\nhave bestowed on other animals, to the Felidae, or Cat-tribe, because\r\nthe same characters serve for all; size and colour being almost the only\r\ndifference among those of which I shall treat. Grace and strength are\r\ntheir universal attributes, the latter lying chiefly in the fore parts\r\nof their frames; such as their paws, legs, shoulders, neck and jaws; the\r\nformer in their arched and rounded form, and the extreme suppleness of\r\ntheir joints. Their muzzle is short and round, some of their teeth are\r\nof enormous size and strength, their sight is very acute both by night\r\nand day; their eyes are set obliquely in the head, and always glare in\r\nthe dark; and sometimes by day when they are in a rage. It is only in\r\nthe smaller tribes that the pupil is vertically linear, when the full\r\nlight causes it to contract. The ears are large, and the sense of\r\nhearing much developed. Their smell is not equally perfect, and the\r\nroughness of their tongue shews, that their taste cannot be very\r\ndelicate. This roughness is caused by the horny papillae, or small\r\nprojections, with points directed backwards, which cover the tongue, and\r\nenable it to lick the flesh from the bones of their food. They have long\r\nbristles on each side of the mouth, which form the most sensitive organs\r\nof touch; each bristle being inserted in a bed of glands under the skin,\r\ncommunicating with a nerve. The claws of the Felidae are extremely\r\nstrong, sharp, and crooked; and all four-feet are furnished with them,\r\nfive before, and four behind; and the most effective system of muscular\r\ncontrivance not only gives such force to the fore-paws, that a blow from\r\none of these will fracture a man's skull, but keeps these claws from\r\ntouching the ground, and enables the animal to draw them back into a\r\nsheath. In aid of this, the sole of the foot, and each of the toes, has\r\na soft, elastic pad, or cushion under it, on which they walk, and as\r\nthey never set the heel to the ground, their footsteps are noiseless,\r\nunless they choose them to be otherwise. It is with their formidable\r\nclaws, and still more formidable teeth, that they tear their prey to\r\npieces.\r\n\r\nNone of the Feline tribe will eat vegetables, unless domesticated, even\r\nthen but rarely; and in their wild state, unless pressed by hunger, they\r\nwill only eat what they themselves have killed. They have an abhorrence\r\nof anything which is decomposed. The fur, with the exception of the\r\nLion's mane, and that of the cat, is short, close, and soft; capable,\r\nwhen dressed, of receiving a high polish. Many are striped and spotted\r\nwith black, and the larger kinds, are generally of a warm, fulvous\r\ncolour. The domestic cat is, however, often white, black, gray, and\r\nbrindled; some leopards are black, and there is a small, beautiful wild\r\ncat, marked like the panther. All are very wary and cunning, and seldom\r\nface their foes. They lie in ambush for them, and suddenly spring upon\r\nthem, seeming to take a pleasure in prolonging their torments. They are\r\nvery sensible to caresses and affection, but a blow, or angry word,\r\nrouses them to fury. They are certainly capricious, and sometimes\r\nwithout any apparent cause burst into fits of ill temper, therefore are\r\nby no means to be trusted, even in the midst of love and docility.\r\n\r\nThe backward carriage of his head, his majestic stride, and the\r\ndeliberate manner in which he looks at his enemy, have caused the Lion\r\nto be called the king of beasts. He is only occasionally seen in the\r\nforests, and inhabits plains, where rocks, or low jungle, afford him a\r\nshelter. He, however, retreats before the advance of men, and has now\r\ndeserted many of those regions where he was once undisputed lord of the\r\ncountry. The Lion of America is altogether different; therefore it may\r\nbe said, that only Central Asia, and almost all Africa are traversed by\r\nhim. Formerly the eastern boundary of Europe scarcely formed a limit to\r\nhis presence; the Arabian literature is full of allusions to him, and\r\nthe Holy Scriptures constantly attest his presence in Syria, during the\r\ntimes in which they were written.\r\n\r\nThe beauty of the Lion's mane is well known. According to Mr. Gordon\r\nCumming, its colour varies with age, being fulvous and bright when\r\nyoung, black when the animal is in his full strength, and grisly with\r\nold age. There has been, however, a species recently discovered in\r\nGuzerat, which has but little or no mane, it also has shorter limbs and\r\ntail, the latter having a larger brush at the end. It is bold, commits\r\ngreat havoc among the cattle; and is supposed to have been driven out of\r\nCutch, by the practice adopted by the natives, of burning their grass. A\r\nnail or prickle at the end of a lion's tail is often found, but has\r\nnothing to do with the caudal vertebrae. It is probably a hardened piece\r\nof skin, or a mass of agglutinated hairs, in the manner of horn; it\r\ncomes off with only a slight touch.\r\n\r\nLions come to their full strength at five years, but live a long time;\r\nfor instance, one from the Gambia was proved to be sixty-three years of\r\nage. They sleep by day, and feed by night, lap their drink, and delight\r\nin coming forth in the midst of furious storms, when they add their\r\nmighty roars to those of the elements. Seldom does a tempest rage in\r\ntropical Africa, but its fearful sounds are increased by the din of wild\r\nanimals; that of the lion being heard above all others. Countless are\r\nthe histories of his depredations, and numerous are the daring and\r\ngallant exploits performed by Europeans against this noble game; the\r\nfollowing is an abridgment of a narrative, from the pen of the\r\nMarchioness of Hastings; and published in the Miscellany of Natural\r\nHistory; herself being the heroine of the chase.\r\n\r\n\"The field was taken in quest of three lions, supposed to be lurking\r\nnear the tents. The ground was flat and ploughed. When we came to the\r\nedge of the jungle, we halted a little; the people came round in crowds,\r\nand, in a few minutes, the trees were covered with men, placed there by\r\nFraser for observation. When we were sent for, we found Fraser by the\r\nside of the great canal--he had received intelligence of both a lion and\r\na tiger, and he desired Barton and myself to go down upon an elephant,\r\nwatch the bed of the canal, and move slowly to the south, while he\r\nadvanced in a contrary direction. The rest of the party were to beat the\r\njungle above, which was too thick to admit the passage of an elephant\r\nthrough it. We fell in with Fraser where the canal was a little wider,\r\nand neither of us had been successful, though we had searched every bush\r\nwith our eyes, in passing along. He desired us to wait till he had\r\nmounted the bank to look after the rest of the elephants. He had hardly\r\ngone away before a lioness crossed the narrow neck of the canal, just\r\nbefore us, and clambered up the opposite bank. I fired, but missed her,\r\nand she ran along the bank to the westward. We turned round and had the\r\nmortification of seeing her again go through the water, at which our\r\nelephant became refractory, wheeled about, and was so unsteady as to\r\nprevent us from firing. We followed her up to the thicket, put the\r\nelephant's head into it, and we heard the lioness growling close to us.\r\nJust as we were expecting her charge and had prepared our guns, round\r\nwheeled the elephant again, and became perfectly unmanageable. During\r\nthe scuffle between the elephant and his driver, we heard the cry that\r\nthe lioness was again off. She again crossed the Nullah, and just as we\r\nhad got our elephant to go well in, the lioness ran back, and crouched\r\nunder a thicket on our left, where she had been originally started. All\r\nthis happened in less than a minute. Fraser then called to us to come\r\nround the bush, as the lioness being on a line with us, we prevented him\r\nfrom firing. Just as we got out of his reach, he fired, and when the\r\nelephant stopped I did the same. Both shots took effect, and the lioness\r\nlay and growled in a hollow, mellow tone. After a few discharges she\r\ntried to sally forth, but her loins were cut to pieces, which was\r\nfortunate for us, as her fore parts seemed strong and unhurt. She reared\r\nherself upon them, and cast towards us a look that bespoke revenge,\r\ncomplaint, and dignity. Her head, half averted from us, was turned back\r\nas if ready to start at us, if the wounds in her loins had not disabled\r\nher. As it was now a mercy to put an end to her sufferings, I took a\r\nsteady aim, and shot her through the head. She fell dead at once, and\r\nher lower jaw was carried away; she was drawn up the bank and pronounced\r\nto be two years old. She had thrown one man down, and got him\r\ncompletely under her with his turban in her mouth, when a shot grazed\r\nher side. She immediately left her hold and crossed the canal, where we\r\nfirst perceived her.\"\r\n\r\nThere used to be, and perhaps is still, a lion in the menagerie of\r\nBrussels, whose cell requiring some repairs, his keeper desired a\r\ncarpenter to set about them; but when he saw the lion, he drew back with\r\nterror. The keeper entered the cell, and then led the animal to the\r\nupper part of it, where he amused himself by playing with him, and then\r\nfell asleep. The carpenter, fully trusting to the vigilance of the\r\nkeeper, pursued his work, and when he had finished, called to him to\r\ninspect what he had done. The man made no answer; the carpenter called\r\nagain and again, but to no purpose, and, being alarmed, went to the\r\nupper part of the den, and looked through the railing. Seeing the lion\r\nand his keeper sleeping side by side, he uttered a loud cry. The lion\r\nsuddenly awakened, started up, looked furiously at the carpenter, and\r\nplacing his paw on the breast of his keeper, lay down to sleep again.\r\nThe carpenter was dreadfully frightened, and ran out, telling what he\r\nhad seen. Some of the attendants went and opened the door which the\r\ncarpenter had secured with several bars, and contrived to wake the\r\nkeeper; who, on opening his eyes, did not appear to be in the least\r\nfrightened at his situation. He took the paw of the lion, shook it, and\r\nquietly led him down to the lower part of his residence.\r\n\r\nIt is from Mr. Pringle and Mr. Gordon Cumming that we derive the most\r\nstirring adventures with lions; and I profit by the advantage afforded\r\nme by their pages. The first was a relation of mine by marriage, and I\r\nhave enjoyed frequent conversations with him concerning his travels;\r\nrendered the more extraordinary by his lameness, which proved the energy\r\nof that mind which could thus surmount bodily infirmity.\r\n\r\nMr. Cumming still lives to tell his own tales; and no one can hear or\r\nread his words without seeing that he has one of those ardent spirits\r\nwhich loves danger for the sake of danger, and that his indomitable\r\ncourage and hardihood, from his early years, when he killed the deer on\r\nhis father's domains, prepared him to be what he now is, the most\r\nsuccessful of all men in his warfare with wild animals.\r\n\r\nIn a note to the \"Poetical Remains of Mr. Pringle,\" I find the following\r\nremarkable escape:--\"Lucas Van Buren usually carried a huge elephant\r\ngun, as long and unwieldy as himself; but left it at home one day when\r\nhe had most need of it. He was riding across the open plains, near the\r\nLittle Fish river, one morning about day break, when observing a lion at\r\na distance, he endeavoured to avoid him by making a circuit. There were\r\nthousands of spring-bocks scattered over the extensive flats; but from\r\nthe open nature of the country, the lion had probably been unsuccessful\r\nin his hunting. Lucas soon perceived that he was not disposed to let\r\n_him_ pass without further parlance, and that he was rapidly approaching\r\nto the encounter. Being without his gun, the farmer, little inclined to\r\ncultivate his acquaintance, turned his horse off at a right angle, and\r\ngalloped for life. But it was too late; the horse was fagged, and bore a\r\nheavy man upon his back; the lion was fresh, furious with hunger, and\r\ncame down upon him like a thunder-bolt. In a few minutes he brought man\r\nand horse to the ground. Luckily, the man was not hurt, and the lion was\r\ntoo much occupied with the horse to pay any attention to him. Hardly\r\nknowing how he escaped, he contrived to do so, and reached the nearest\r\nhouse. His remarks, when he related his adventure, were concerning the\r\naudacity of the lion in attacking a Christian man; but his chief\r\nvexation was about the saddle. He returned to the spot the next day, and\r\nfound the horse's bones picked clean, lion and saddle having both\r\ndisappeared. Lucas said he could excuse the beast for killing the horse,\r\nas he had allowed himself to escape; but the abstraction of the saddle,\r\nfor which, he added, the lion could not possibly have any use, raised\r\nhis spleen, and called down a shower of abuse whenever he related the\r\nstory.\r\n\r\n\"We had,\" says Mr. Pringle, \"been to tea with Captain Cameron's family,\r\nto whom, as we were only three miles distant, we considered ourselves\r\nnext-door neighbours; and as the weather was fine, we rode home by\r\nmoonlight, jesting all the way about wild beasts and Caffres, and not at\r\nall suspecting that a lion was dogging us through the bushes the whole\r\nway home.\r\n\r\n\"About midnight I was awakened by an unusual noise in the cattle-fold,\r\nand looking out, saw all our horned cattle spring over the high thorn\r\nfence, and scamper round the place. Fancying that a hyaena, which I had\r\nheard howling when I went to bed, had alarmed the animals, I sallied\r\nforth to have a shot at it. I, however, could not find any cause for the\r\ndisturbance, and calling a Hottentot to drive back the cattle, and shut\r\nthem in, I again went to bed. The next morning Captain Cameron rode over\r\nto say, his herdsman had discovered that a large lion had followed us up\r\nthe valley, and then, on further inspection, we found he had visited the\r\nfold, and carried off a sheep. He appeared to have retreated to the\r\nmountains, and we did not pursue him.\r\n\r\n\"The lion, however, was not disposed to let us off so easily. He\r\nreturned that night, and killed my favourite riding-horse, a little more\r\nthan a hundred yards from my door; I then considered it right to take\r\nmeasures for defence, and called forth a party for his pursuit, the\r\nHottentots saying that as he had only eaten a small part of the horse he\r\nwould be in the vicinity. Seventeen horsemen, Mulattoes and Hottentots,\r\nand a number of strong hounds, soon assembled.\r\n\r\n\"The Hottentots traced the lion on foot, discovering his spoor, or\r\ntrack, with surprising dexterity, and found him in a large thicket about\r\na mile distant. The dogs failed to dislodge him, the Mulattoes rode\r\nround the jungle, and fired into it, but without effect. At last three\r\nScotchmen determined to march in, provided the Mulattoes would support\r\ntheir fire. Regardless of the warnings of more prudent men, they went\r\nin, and, as they thought, found the lion crouched among the roots of a\r\nlarge evergreen bush, glaring at them from under the foliage. They fired\r\nand struck, not the lion, but a great block of sand-stone, which they\r\nbad mistaken for him; but beyond which he was actually lying. With a\r\nfurious growl he bolted from the bush; the Mulattoes fled\r\nhelter-skelter, leaving the Scots with empty guns, tumbling over each\r\nother in their haste to escape. In a twinkling he was upon them, with\r\none stroke of his paw dashed John Rennie to the ground, and with one\r\nfoot upon him, looked round upon his assailants in conscious power and\r\npride, and with the most noble and imposing port that could be\r\nconceived. It was the most magnificent thing I ever witnessed; but the\r\ndanger of our friends was too great to enjoy the picture. We expected\r\nevery minute to see one or more of them torn to pieces; and yet in their\r\nposition, one lying under the lion's paw, and the others scrambling\r\ntowards us, we dared not fire. Fortunately, however, the lion, after\r\nsteadily surveying us, turned calmly away, drove off the hounds with his\r\nheels, as if they had been rats, and bounded over the adjoining thicket\r\nlike a cat, clearing bushes twelve or fifteen feet high, as if they had\r\nbeen tufts of grass.\r\n\r\n\"Our comrade had sustained no other injury than a scratch upon the back,\r\nand a severe bruise, and we renewed the chase. We found the enemy\r\nstanding at bay under a mimosa tree. The dogs barked round him, but were\r\nafraid to approach; for he growled fiercely, and brandished his tail in\r\na manner that showed he meditated mischief. The Hottentots, by taking a\r\ncircuit, reached a precipice above him, another party of us occupied a\r\nposition on the other side of the glen, so that the lion was between two\r\nfires; he became confused, we battered away at him, and he fell, pierced\r\nwith many wounds. He appeared to be full grown, and six years old,\r\nmeasuring eleven feet from the nose to the tip of the tail. His fore\r\nleg, below the knee, was so thick, that I could not span it with both\r\nhands; his head was almost as large as that of an ordinary ox. His\r\nflesh, which I had the curiosity to taste, resembled very white, coarse\r\nbeef, and was insipid rather than disagreeable.\"\r\n\r\nThe ensuing histories are from Mr. Gordon Cumming's pen;--\"A buffalo was\r\nwounded, and two hunters in pursuit of him were joined by three lions,\r\nwho also gave chase, and getting before the gentlemen sprang upon the\r\nbuffalo. The latter, being very large, struggled much; the hunters fired\r\nupon the lions, and as each ball struck, the latter seemed to think the\r\nblood which flowed came from the buffalo's bones; consequently, two were\r\neasily secured, but the third had the sense to walk away.\r\n\r\n\"The Oryx sometimes fights the lion, and is victorious; but the bodies\r\nhave been seen lying close together, the lion having been pierced\r\nthrough by the horns of the gemsbok, and as he could not draw them out\r\nagain, each died from the mortal blow inflicted by, at least, one of\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n\"Hendrick and Ruyter lay on one side of the fire under one blanket, and\r\nJohn Stefolus on the other; the fire was very small, and the night was\r\npitch dark and windy. Suddenly the appalling and murderous voice of an\r\nangry, blood-thirsty lion burst upon my ear, within a few yards of us,\r\nfollowed by the shrieking of the Hottentots. Again and again the\r\nterrific roar of attack was repeated. We heard John and Ruyter shriek,\r\n'The lion! the lion!' Still, for a few minutes, all thought he was only\r\nchasing one of the dogs round the kraal; but the next instant John\r\nStefolus rushed into the midst of us almost speechless with fear, his\r\neyes bursting from their sockets, and shrieked out, 'The lion! the lion!\r\nhe has got Hendrick; he dragged him away from the fire; I struck him\r\nwith the burning brand upon his head, but he would not let go his hold.\r\nHendrick is dead! Let us take fire and look for him!' The rest of my\r\npeople rushed about, shrieking and yelling as if they were mad. I was\r\nangry with them for their folly, and told them if they did not stand\r\nstill and keep quiet, the lion would have another of us; most likely\r\nthere was a troop of them. The dogs were let loose, and the fire\r\nincreased. Hendrick's name was shouted; but all was then still. I told\r\nthe men he was dead, and had everything brought within the cattle-fold,\r\nlighted a fire, and closed the entrance as well as we could. We sat with\r\nour guns in our hands till daylight, expecting a lion every moment; the\r\ndogs fought one another, then got scent of the lion, and barked at him\r\ntill day broke, he now and then driving them back; and he lay all the\r\nnight within forty yards of the party, having dragged the man into a\r\nlittle hollow at the back of the bush. He had grappled him with his\r\nclaws, and bitten him in the breast and shoulder, all the while feeling\r\nfor his neck, and when he got hold of that dragged him into the shade.\r\nThe poor man cried, 'Help me, help me, oh God! Men, help me!' then all\r\nwas still, except that his comrades heard the cracking of his bones. The\r\nbeast did not heed the beating about the head with the burning wood. The\r\nlion dragged the remains of him away the next morning, but in the hollow\r\nwas found one of poor Hendrick's legs, the shoe still on the foot, with\r\nfragments of his coat. The next day came the lion's turn; for the party,\r\nby killing him, avenged the death of poor Hendrick.\"\r\n\r\nIt has often been said that the human voice has great power over the\r\nfiercest animals; and I do not think a stronger proof of it can be met\r\nwith, than in this adventure of Mr. Gordon Cumming's:--\"I fired at the\r\nnearest lioness, having only one shot in my rifle. The ball told badly;\r\nthe lioness at which I had fired wheeled right round, and came on,\r\nlashing her tail, showing her teeth, and making that horrid, murderous,\r\ndeep growl, which an angry lion generally utters. Her comrade hastily\r\nretreated. The instant the lioness came on, I stood up to my full\r\nheight, holding my rifle, and my arms extended high above my head. This\r\nchecked her in her course, but on looking round, and missing her\r\ncomrade, and observing Ruyter slowly advancing, she was still more\r\nexasperated, and fancying that she was near being surrounded, she made\r\nanother forward movement, growling terribly. This was a moment of great\r\ndanger, I felt that my only chance of safety was extreme steadiness, so,\r\nstanding motionless as a rock, with my eyes firmly fixed upon her, I\r\ncalled in a clear, commanding voice, 'Holloa, old girl! What's the\r\nhurry? take it easy! Holloa! holloa!' She once more halted and seemed\r\nperplexed, looking round for her comrade. I then thought it prudent to\r\nbeat a retreat, which I very slowly did, talking to the lioness all the\r\ntime. She seemed undecided as to her future movements, and was gazing\r\nafter me, and snuffing the ground, when I last beheld her.\"\r\n\r\nI copy the ensuing anecdote from Mr. Campbell's second journey to\r\nAfrica. \"A lion had been near to a bushman's hut the whole night,\r\nwaiting, it was supposed for the arrival of his companions, to assist in\r\nattacking the family; and if they had made the attack in conjunction\r\nwith each other, it is probable they would have met with success. Two\r\nBootchuana herdsmen, attending near the place next morning, saw him and\r\nran to inform the people. On their way they met six Griquas coming to\r\nattack the formidable creature, having already heard he was there.\r\nAdvancing towards him, they fired, and wounded, but did not disable him.\r\nEnraged by pain, he advanced to take revenge on his assailants. On\r\nseeing him approach, the Griquas leaped from their horses, formed them\r\ninto a close line with their tails towards the lion, and took their\r\nstand at the horse's heads. The enraged animal flew upon a Bootchuana\r\nwho was not protected by the horses, and who tried to defend himself\r\nwith his kaross, or skin cloak. The lion, however, caught him by the\r\narm, threw him on the ground; and while the poor man still tried to\r\ndefend himself, by keeping the kaross round him, the lion got under it,\r\nand gnawed part of his thigh. His Bootchuana companion at that time\r\nthrew his assagai, which entered the lion's back. The Griquas would have\r\nfired, but were afraid of shooting the man; in order then to drive him\r\naway, they made a great noise, and threw some stones. The lion then left\r\nthe man, and rushed on them, when they again checked his attack by\r\nturning the horses round. He next crept under the belly of a mare, and\r\nseized her by the fore legs, but with a powerful kick she made him let\r\ngo his hold. In revenge, and by one stroke of his paw, he tore open the\r\nbody of the mare, and retired. After this, he tried to get round the\r\nhorses to the men, but when on the point of making a spring, he was\r\nhappily killed by a musket ball, the ball penetrating behind the ear.\"\r\n\r\nIt is singular, says Mr. Sparrman in his African travels, that the lion\r\nis reported frequently, although provoked, to content himself with\r\nsometimes only wounding the human species, or at least to wait some time\r\nbefore he gives the fatal blow to the unhappy victim he has got under\r\nhim. A farmer had the misfortune to see a lion seize two of his oxen, at\r\nthe very instant he had taken them out of the wagon, but they fell\r\ndown dead, having had their backs broken. A father and two sons were in\r\nsearch of a lion, when he rushed upon them, threw one of them under his\r\nfeet, but he received no great hurt, for the two others shot him dead\r\nupon the spot. Another farmer had lain some time under a lion, received\r\nseveral bruises from the beast, and was a good deal bitten by him in one\r\narm, but the noble animal, as it were, gave him his life: nevertheless,\r\nothers say, that if a lion once taste human blood, he for ever after\r\nthirsts for it. So strong is this opinion in India, that an officer who\r\nwas asleep with his left hand out of bed, was awoke by his pet lion\r\nlicking him. Of course the rough tongue brought blood, and he tried to\r\nwithdraw his hand. The lion gave a slight growl, upon which the officer\r\ntook a loaded pistol from under his pillow, and shot him dead, feeling\r\nconvinced if he escaped then, he should never again be safe.\r\n\r\nI might multiply my stories of destruction and escapes, till they alone\r\nwould form a volume, but I would rather give a few instances of the\r\ngratitude of this magnificent creature. \"One day,\" relates Mr. Hope,\r\n\"the company attended the Duchess of Hamilton to see her lion fed; and\r\nwhile they were teasing and provoking him, the porter came and said,\r\nthat a sergeant with some recruits at the gate begged to see the lion.\r\nHer grace afforded permission; the lion was growling over his prey, the\r\nsergeant advanced to the cage, called \"Nero, Nero, don't you know me,\"\r\nand the animal instantly raised his head; rose, left his food, and\r\nwagging his tail went to the bars of his cage. The man patted him, and\r\nthen said it was three years since they had seen each other, that he had\r\ntaken charge of the lion from Gibraltar, and he was glad to see the poor\r\nbeast shew so much gratitude. The lion, indeed, seemed to be perfectly\r\npleased, went to and fro, rubbing himself against the place where his\r\nold friend stood, and licked the sergeant's hand as he held it out to\r\nhim.\"\r\n\r\nA lion, which, for its extreme beauty, was to be sent to Paris from\r\nSenegal, fell sick before the departure of the vessel, and was let loose\r\nto die on an open space of ground. A traveller there, as he returned\r\nhome from a hunting excursion, found him in a very exhausted state, and\r\ncompassionately poured a quantity of milk down his throat. Thus\r\nrefreshed, the poor beast recovered. From that time he became so tame,\r\nand was so attached to his benefactor, that he afterwards ate from his\r\nhand and followed him like a dog, with only a string tied round his\r\nneck.\r\n\r\nM. Felix, one of the keepers of the animals of the Menagerie in Paris,\r\nbecame so ill, that another person was obliged to perform his duty. A\r\nmale lion, whom, with a female, he himself had brought to the place,\r\nremained constantly at one end of his cage, and refused to eat anything\r\ngiven him by the stranger, at whom he often roared. He even disliked the\r\ncompany of the female, and paid no attention to her. The animal was\r\nsupposed to be ill, and yet no one dared to approach him. At length M.\r\nFelix recovered, and intending to surprise the lion, showed his face\r\nbetween the bars. In a moment the beast made a bound, leaped against the\r\nbars, caressed him with his paws, licked his face, and trembled with\r\npleasure. The female also ran to him; but the lion drove her back, as if\r\nshe were not to snatch any of the favours from Felix, and he was about\r\nto quarrel with her. The keeper then entered the cage, and caressed them\r\nby turns, and after that often went to them, and had complete control\r\nover them. They would obey all his commands, and all their recompense\r\nwas to lick his hand.\r\n\r\nA curious circumstance took place at New Orleans in the year 1832, when\r\na bear was let down into the cage of an old African lion, supposing it\r\nwould be torn to pieces. As many people were assembled to see the\r\nbarbarous exhibition, the bear placed himself in a fighting posture, and\r\nflew at the lion; but, to the great disappointment of all present, the\r\nlion placed his paw upon the bear's head, as if to express his pity, and\r\ntried to make friends with him. He took the bear under his protection,\r\nsuffered no one to approach close to the cage, and did not sleep till\r\nhe was exhausted, so closely did he watch over his new friend. He\r\nsuffered the bear to eat, but long refused food for himself, and when\r\nthe last accounts were received, continued to guard the bear as\r\njealously as possible.\r\n\r\nThe lioness has no mane; is smaller, and more slender in her proportions\r\nthan the male; she carries her head even with the line of her back, and\r\nwants the majestic courage of the lion, but she is more agile. Her\r\ntemper is more irritable, and Mr. Gordon Cumming says:--\"She is more\r\ndangerous before she has been a mother; yet every vestige of tameness or\r\ndocility vanishes when she _is_ a mother, and she is then in a constant\r\nstate of excitement, getting into the most violent fury if any one\r\nshould attempt to touch her cubs.\" The story of the lioness which one\r\nnight attacked one of the horses of the Exeter mail has been told so\r\nmany different ways, that I am glad to copy the correct account from\r\nCaptain Brown's \"Popular Natural History\":--\"She had made her escape\r\nfrom a travelling Menagerie, on its way to Salisbury fair, and suddenly\r\nseized one of the leading horses. This, of course, produced great alarm\r\nand confusion, which was not lessened by perceiving what the enemy was;\r\nand two inside passengers took refuge in a house. A large mastiff\r\nattacked the intruder, upon which she quited the horse, and turned upon\r\nhim; he fled, but she pursued and killed him, after running forty\r\nyards. On the alarm being given, her keepers went after her, till she\r\ntook refuge under a granary, with the dog still within her teeth. They\r\nbarricaded her there to prevent her escape, and she roared there so\r\nloudly, that she was heard half a mile off. She was afterwards secured\r\nand taken to her den; and of course her adventure increased the\r\ncelebrity of the menagerie to which she belonged. Before this happened,\r\nshe was considered as very tame, and never had given any signs of\r\nferocity; she therefore affords another example, that it is not safe to\r\ntrust these animals: of course the poor horse was dreadfully torn, and\r\nthe expressions of his agony were most affecting; the lioness, however,\r\nhad missed the vital parts.\"\r\n\r\nThe Puma or Cougar, of North and South America, is generally called a\r\nlion, but he has no mane, or tufted tail, and when young, his pale, fawn\r\ncoat, is striped with blackish brown. These marks however, disappear\r\nwith age. He is the largest of the feline tribe on that continent, and\r\nis very destructive to smaller animals. He rarely attacks man, and on\r\nsome occasions evinces as much courage as the true lion, and a curious\r\nobservation has been made by travellers, that he becomes less bold as he\r\napproaches to the north. One given to Professor Jamieson of Edinburgh,\r\nseemed to delight in playing with a tub of water, he also played with\r\ndogs and monkeys without the slightest interruption to their good\r\nunderstanding; but if a goat or a fowl came in sight, they were snapped\r\nup immediately. He made his escape one night in London; and offered no\r\nresistance when caught by a watchman. He is hunted on the Pampas by\r\ndogs, and the Indians secure him with the bolas or the lasso. He climbs\r\ntrees with great facility; his skin makes excellent gloves; and many\r\npersons consider his flesh to be dainty food.\r\n\r\nMr. Waterton, in one of his essays, makes some remarks, and relates a\r\nstory which ought to be inserted in every book which treats of feline\r\nanimals; therefore, although many others have quoted them, I do not\r\napologize for inserting an abridgment of them here. He says, all animals\r\nof the dog tribe must be combated with might and main, and with\r\nunceasing exertion, in their attacks upon man; for from the moment they\r\nobtain the mastery, they worry and tear their victim as long as life\r\nremains in it. On the contrary, animals of the cat tribe, having once\r\novercome their prey, cease for a certain time to inflict further injury\r\nupon it. Thus, during the momentous intervals, from the stroke which has\r\nlaid a man beneath a lion, to the time when the lion shall begin to\r\ndevour him, the man may have it in his power to rise again; either by\r\nhis own exertions, or by the fortunate intervention of an armed friend.\r\nBut then all depends upon quiet on the part of the man, until he\r\nplunges his dagger into the heart of the animal; for if he tries to\r\nresist, he is sure to feel the force of his adversary's claws and teeth\r\nwith redoubled vengeance. Many years ago, Colonel Duff, in India, was\r\nlaid low by the stroke of a Bengal tiger. On coming to himself, he found\r\nthe animal standing over him. Recollecting that he had his dirk by his\r\nside, he drew it out of the case, in the most cautious manner possible,\r\nand by one happy thrust quite through the heart, he laid the tiger dead\r\nat his side.\r\n\r\nThe particular instance, however, to which Mr. Waterton alludes, and\r\nwhich was told him by the parties themselves, I now briefly give:--The\r\nweather was intolerably sultry. After vainly spending a considerable\r\ntime in creeping through the grass and bushes, with the hope of\r\ndiscovering the place of the lion's retreat, they (the party) concluded\r\nthat he had passed quite through the jungle, and gone off in an opposite\r\ndirection. Resolved not to let their game escape, Lieutenants Delamain\r\nand Lang returned to the elephant, and immediately proceeded round the\r\njungle, expecting to discover the route which they conjectured the lion\r\nhad taken. Captain Woodhouse, however, remained in the thicket, and as\r\nhe could discern the print of the animal's foot on the ground, he boldly\r\nresolved to follow up the track at all hazards. The Indian game-finder\r\nwho continued with his commander, at last espied the lion in the covert,\r\nand pointed him out to the Captain, who fired, but unfortunately missed\r\nhis mark. There was now no alternative left but to retreat and load his\r\nrifle. Having retired to a distance he was joined by Lieutenant\r\nDelamain, who had dismounted from his elephant on hearing the report of\r\nthe gun. This unexpected meeting increased the Captain's hopes of\r\nultimate success. He pointed out to the Lieutenant the place where he\r\nwould probably find the lion, and said he would be up with him in a\r\nmoment or two.\r\n\r\nLieutenant Delamain on going eight or ten paces down, got a sight of the\r\nlion and discharged his rifle at him. This irritated the mighty king,\r\nand he rushed towards him. Captain Woodhouse now found himself placed in\r\nan awkward situation. He was aware that if he retraced his steps in\r\norder to put himself in a better position for attack he would just get\r\nto the point to which the lion was making, wherefore he instantly\r\nresolved to stand still, in the hopes that the lion would pass by at a\r\ndistance of four yards or so, without perceiving him, as the intervening\r\ncover was thick and strong. In this, however, he was deceived; for the\r\nenraged lion saw him as he passed, and flew at him with a dreadful roar.\r\nIn an instant, as though it had been done by a stroke of lightning, the\r\nrifle was broken and thrown out of the Captain's hand, his left leg at\r\nthe same moment being seized by the claws, and his right arm by the\r\nteeth, of his desperate antagonist. Lieutenant Delamain ran up and\r\ndischarged his piece full at the lion; and this caused the lion and the\r\nCaptain to come to the ground together, whilst the Lieutenant hastened\r\nout of the jungle to re-load his gun. The lion now began to crunch the\r\nCaptain's arm; but the brave fellow, notwithstanding the pain, had the\r\ncool determined resolution to lie still. The lordly savage let the arm\r\ndrop out of his mouth, and quietly placed himself in a couching\r\nposition, with both his paws upon the thigh of his fallen foe. While\r\nthings were in this untoward situation, the Captain unthinkingly, raised\r\nhis hand to support his head, which had got placed ill at ease in the\r\nfall. No sooner, however, had he moved it, than the lion seized the\r\nlacerated arm a second time; crunched it as before, and fractured the\r\nbone still higher up. This additional _memento mori_ from the lion was\r\nnot lost on Captain Woodhouse; it immediately put him in mind that he\r\nhad committed an act of imprudence in stirring. The motionless state in\r\nwhich he persevered after this broad hint, shewed that he had learnt to\r\nprofit by the painful lesson.\r\n\r\nThe two Lieutenants were now hastening to his assistance, and he heard\r\nthe welcome sound of feet approaching; but unfortunately they were in a\r\nwrong direction, as the lion was betwixt them and him. Aware that if\r\nhis friends fired, the balls would hit him, after they had passed\r\nthrough the lion's body, Captain Woodhouse quietly pronounced, in a low\r\nand subdued tone, \"to the other side! to the other side!\" Hearing the\r\nvoice, they looked in the direction from whence it proceeded, and to\r\ntheir horror saw their brave comrade in his utmost need. Having made a\r\ncircuit, they cautiously came up on the other side; and Lieutenant\r\nDelamain, whose coolness in encounters with wild beasts had always been\r\nconspicuous, from a distance of about a dozen yards, fired at the lion\r\nover the person of the prostrate warrior. The lion merely quivered; his\r\nhead dropped upon the ground, and in an instant he lay dead on his side,\r\nclose to his intended victim.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTIGERS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Tiger is exclusively an Asiatic animal, and his range extends, not\r\nonly over the more southern part of that continent, but to the larger\r\nislands of the Archipelago, where he is particularly destructive. He is\r\nas tall as the lion, but not quite so powerful; he is, however, more\r\nagile, more graceful, and more insidious. He crouches, and mostly\r\nsprings in the same manner as the lion and other feline animals; he is\r\nmore ferocious, and will even fight with the lion. He seems to delight\r\nin blood itself, for he will kill several victims, suck their blood,\r\nand leave their carcasses to be devoured at another opportunity.\r\n\r\nThe colour of the tiger is a bright orange tawny, white underneath, and\r\nbroad black stripes on the back, sides and tail. His head is rounder\r\nthan that of the lion, and he takes the most enormous leaps; he is to be\r\ntamed to a certain extent, but never trusted. He prowls both night and\r\nday; and in some places, the devastation he has caused is terrific.\r\nNothing can exceed the tragic tales which are told of him, in the\r\ncountries where he exists in numbers; and in one part of India, it is\r\nsaid that at least three hundred lives were taken every year, within a\r\ndistrict containing seven villages, independent of an enormous number of\r\nsheep, goats, and cattle. Horses will not stand in his presence with any\r\nsteadiness; and the elephant is restless when in his vicinity. This\r\nsagacious animal often manages to shake him off; and if he have taken\r\nhold of his trunk, he tramples on him with his fore-feet and so destroys\r\nhim. If he cannot dislodge him from his body, he lies down upon him, and\r\nattempts to kill him by rolling his ponderous weight upon him. Seldom,\r\nhowever, is the tiger the aggressor, unless he be driven to it by\r\nhunger, or maddened by pain and despair, and then he struggles till he\r\ndies. He hides himself with such caution and skill, that travellers are\r\nlaid hold of without being aware of his vicinity. The bride has been\r\nsnatched from her camel, the sportsman from his elephant, and the child\r\nfrom its mother.\r\n\r\nTigers are much more easily caught in traps than lions; and those most\r\nused, are made so as to fall upon them when they seize the bait. In\r\nSumatra the natives poison the carcasses which are left for them, or\r\nthey fasten these baits to a stake, or tree, and place a vessel filled\r\nwith arsenic and water near by, of which the tiger invariably drinks,\r\nafter making a full meal.\r\n\r\nA tiger is easily started by a sudden noise, as the well-known story of\r\nMrs. Day and her umbrella will prove; but I have another and more recent\r\ninstance of this, which occurred to my brother. He was one evening on\r\nhis return to his own house, from that of a brother officer with whom he\r\nhad been dining, and he was met by his servants, who intreated of him to\r\nmake haste home, for there was a tiger prowling round; and, in fact, a\r\njackal was close to him, who so often accompanies the tiger when seeking\r\nhis prey. My brother had been two or three years in India, and yet had\r\nnever seen one of these animals, so he told his men they might return,\r\nbut he should stay, for he much wished to see a tiger. They in vain\r\ntried to dissuade him; but, fancying the beast was close by, they all\r\nran away, and left him to his fate. He sat down quietly by the bank of\r\nhis garden, and had not been there long when the tiger actually\r\nappeared. He stopped, looked very grand, and seemed doubtful whether he\r\nshould make an attack on the motionless person before him, and there\r\nnever was a more beautiful animal than he appeared to be. He uttered a\r\nsort of growl, and crouched down, as the cat often does when tormenting\r\na mouse; and my brother almost gave himself up for lost. He fancied that\r\nhe had been hidden, and that the tiger could not perceive him as he\r\npassed; but he took off his grenadier cap, which was large, and covered\r\nwith bear's skin, and putting it before his face roared in it as loudly\r\nas he could; the noise and the action so surprised the tiger, that he\r\nturned round, and leaped into the neighbouring thicket. My brother\r\nhastened away, and met his servants, who, now the danger was over, were\r\ncoming to protect their master with drums and torches.\r\n\r\nThe tiger has been known to snatch without springing, of which the\r\nfollowing anecdote, told me by a friend, is a confirmation. He was going\r\nup one of the rivers in Assam, at the time when our troops took\r\npossession of that country, in a covered boat, and his principal servant\r\nretired on to the roof of the covering, to smoke at his ease. The river\r\nwas narrow, the banks were high, and they were going at a leisurely\r\npace, when my friend heard a slight scuffle over his head, then a\r\nscream, followed by the cries of his party. On inquiring the cause, the\r\nlatter told him that a tiger had crept on to the top of the boat, put\r\nout his paw, laid hold of the man as the boat passed, and dragged him\r\ninto the jungle.\r\n\r\nThe history of an unfortunate guide is an instance of the immediate\r\nmischief which ensues from the first blow of one of these powerful\r\ncreatures. The poor man remonstrated with the officer, whose party he\r\nwas conducting, on the imprudence of marching before daylight; but the\r\nofficer, supposing it to be laziness, threatened to punish him if he did\r\nnot go on. The man took his shield and sword, and walked along the\r\nnarrow path, bordered on each side by high grass and bamboo. After going\r\nfive miles, the officer heard a tremendous roar, and a large tiger\r\npassed him, so close, that he nearly brushed his horse, and sprang upon\r\nthe guide. The latter lifted up his shield, but he was down in an\r\ninstant, and under the tiger's paws, who seized him with his teeth,\r\ngrowled, and looked at the officer. The tiger was attacked, and so\r\nseverely wounded that he dropped his victim; but it was all over with\r\nthe poor guide, the first blow had literally smashed his head in pieces.\r\n\r\nIn a plain near the Narbudda river, a party were hunting a tiger; but\r\nthe beast did not seem inclined to come to a battle with his\r\nantagonists. He trotted across the plain, and as he passed an\r\nunfortunate cow, he raised his paw, gave her a blow on the shoulder, and\r\nshe fell. He went on, and when the hunters examined the cow, she was\r\ndead, he having left the print of every toe, and, in fact, every part of\r\nhis paw upon the shoulder blade, without making the smallest wound.\r\n\r\nThe following anecdotes have been obtained from various sources, and\r\nsome of the narrators were actors in the scenes described. A tiger had\r\nsprung upon the shoulder of Lieutenant Colnett's elephant, who in this\r\nsituation fired at him, and he fell. Conceiving him to be disabled, the\r\nLieutenant descended from the elephant for the purpose of dispatching\r\nhim with his pistols; but in alighting, he came in contact with the\r\ntiger, who had only crouched for a second spring, and who, catching hold\r\nof him by the thigh, dragged him some distance along the ground. Having\r\nsucceeded in drawing one of a brace of pistols from his belt, Lieutenant\r\nColnett fired, and lodged a ball in the body of the tiger, when the\r\nbeast became enraged, shook him violently without letting go his hold,\r\nand made off towards the thickest part of the jungle with his prey. In\r\nthe struggle to disengage himself from the clutches of the animal, the\r\nLieutenant caught hold of the tiger by both his ears, and succeeded,\r\nafter some time, in throwing the beast on his side, when he availed\r\nhimself of his momentary release to draw forth the remaining pistol, and\r\nplacing the muzzle at the breast of the tiger, shot him through the\r\nheart. He then returned to his elephant, which he mounted without\r\nassistance, feeling at the moment little pain from his wounds, although\r\nhe received no fewer than thirty-five, from the effects of which he long\r\nafterwards continued to suffer.\r\n\r\nA very large Royal tiger descended from some heights. After he had\r\nsettled himself, a party advanced, and he seemed anxious to charge, but\r\nshowed great reluctance to quit the spot where he had rested. Several\r\nballs struck him in the flanks, and a musket ball having pierced his\r\nside obliquely, passed through his liver, and he did not rise again. His\r\nskin measured ten feet four inches and a half, and he was ten years of\r\nage; for he had ten lobes to his liver, and it is by the appearance of\r\nthe tiger's liver that the natives ascertain the age.\r\n\r\nI have quoted the above anecdote, not to prove the truth of the\r\ncircumstance as regards the tiger's liver, but as a tradition among the\r\ninhabitants.\r\n\r\nThe people of Chittagong were alarmed by the appearance of a tigress,\r\nwho was first discovered among some cattle that were grazing at the\r\nmouth of the river. On the first alarm, the natives of the vicinity\r\nassembled with all speed and advanced against her. Irritated by this,\r\nshe sprang furiously on the person nearest to her, and wounded him\r\nseverely. The immediate attack of the crowd, however, was successful in\r\nrescuing the man from her grasp. On this the tigress, finding herself\r\nhemmed in on all sides, and seeing no way of avoiding the multitude,\r\nexcept by the river, took to the water, and swam about five miles,\r\nclosely pursued by the natives in their boats, until she landed under a\r\ntree in a dockyard. Here she laid herself down, apparently much\r\nfatigued; but before the people in the yard could get their fire arms\r\nready, she had, in a great degree, recovered her strength. Several shots\r\nwere fired at her, and two of them penetrated her body, one of which\r\nlamed her. Rendered desperate by this, she advanced against her new\r\nopponents, and singling out a European gentleman in the yard, who was\r\nprovided with a cutlass, she sprang upon him before he could make use of\r\nhis weapon; knocked him down with her fore paw, seized his head in her\r\nmouth, bit off a considerable part of the skin of his forehead, and\r\nwounded him in several places. After this, she sprang upon a native,\r\nfractured his skull, and otherwise lacerated him so dreadfully that he\r\ndied next day. She then entered a thicket close by, where she was\r\nallowed to remain unmolested. On the morning of the following day, she\r\nhad got about a mile further from the water side, and near to a sepoy\r\nvillage. Here she was surrounded by about a thousand natives, when,\r\nalthough she was very lame, she sprang furiously on several of them, and\r\nwounded one poor woman so dreadfully, as to occasion her death. A\r\nfortunate shot, however, laid the animal prostrate.\r\n\r\nThere is an account of a tame tiger which was brought from China in the\r\nPitt East Indiaman, \"who was so far domesticated as to admit of every\r\nkind of familiarity from the people on board. He seemed to be quite\r\nharmless and as playful as a kitten. He frequently slept with the\r\nsailors in their hammocks, and would suffer two or three of them to\r\nrepose their heads on his back, as upon a pillow, while he lay stretched\r\nupon the deck. In return for this, he would, however, now and then steal\r\ntheir meat. Having one day carried off a piece of beef from the\r\ncarpenter, the man followed the animal, took it out of his mouth, and\r\nbeat him severely for the theft, which punishment he suffered with all\r\nthe patience of a dog. He would frequently run out upon the bowsprit,\r\nclimb about like a cat, and perform a number of tricks, with astonishing\r\nagility. There was a dog on board, with whom he often played in the most\r\namusing manner; he was only a month or six weeks old when he was taken\r\non board, and arrived in England before he had completed a year.\"\r\n\r\nThe tiger is not as fond of his children as the lion is, and often\r\nabandons the female while she is rearing her young. The tigress will\r\ndestroy her offspring as the cat does; but the following is an instance\r\nof her affection, taken from Captain Williamson's \"Oriental Field\r\nSports.\" This officer had two tiger cubs brought to him, which had been\r\ndiscovered, with two more, by some villagers while their mother had been\r\nin quest of prey. The captain put them into a stable where they were\r\nvery noisy during the night. A few days having elapsed, their mother at\r\nlength discovered where they were, came to relieve them, and replied to\r\ntheir cries by tremendous howlings, which induced their keeper to set\r\nthe cubs at liberty, lest the dam should break in. She had carried them\r\noff to an adjoining jungle before morning.\r\n\r\nBishop Heber happily compares the slight movement of the long grass of\r\nthe jungle, which betrays the presence of the tiger, to the bubbles\r\nwhich rise to the surface of water, and show the lurking place of the\r\notter.\r\n\r\nThe immense strength of the tiger is frequently shown by the manner in\r\nwhich he throws his prey over his shoulder, and conveys it to his lair\r\nto be devoured. One is said to have carried a buffalo in this manner,\r\nwhich weighed a thousand pounds. Captain Brown gives the following\r\naccount of the innate love of flesh displayed by the tiger:--\"A party of\r\ngentlemen from Bombay, one day visiting the stupendous temple of\r\nElephants, discovered a tiger's whelp in one of the obscure recesses.\r\nDesirous of kidnapping the cub, without encountering the fury of its\r\ndam, they took it up hastily and cautiously retreated. Being left\r\nentirely at liberty, and extremely well fed, the tiger grew rapidly,\r\nappeared tame, and in every respect domesticated. At length, when it had\r\nattained a great size, and, notwithstanding its apparent gentleness,\r\nbegan to inspire terror by its tremendous powers of doing mischief. A\r\npiece of raw meat, dripping with blood, fell in its way. Hitherto it had\r\nbeen studiously kept from animal food; but the instant it had dipped its\r\ntongue in blood, something like madness seemed to have seized upon the\r\nanimal. A destructive principle, hitherto dormant, was awakened; it\r\ndarted fiercely and with glaring eyes upon its prey, tore it to pieces\r\nwith fury, and roaring in the most fearful manner, rushed at once into\r\nthe jungle.\"\r\n\r\nI am not sorry to end this account of the tiger with an old story, which\r\nplaces the fierce beast of prey in rather a more amiable light than most\r\nof the previous histories. \"A tigress of great beauty, from Bengal,\r\nbeing extremely docile on her passage home from Calcutta, was allowed to\r\nrun about the vessel, and became exceedingly familiar with the sailors.\r\nOn her arrival in the Thames, however, her temper became very irascible,\r\nand even dangerous. She was placed in the Tower, where she for some time\r\ncontinued to exhibit a sulky and savage disposition. One day, the person\r\nwho had charge of her on board the ship, visited the Tower, and begged\r\npermission of the keeper to be allowed to enter her den, to which he at\r\nlast agreed, though with much reluctance. No sooner did the tigress\r\nrecognise her old friend, than she fawned upon him, licked, and caressed\r\nhim, exhibiting the most extravagant signs of pleasure; and when he\r\nleft her, she whined and cried the whole day afterwards.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLEOPARDS, PANTHERS, ETC.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Felis Leopardus and the Felis Pardus of authors, represent the\r\nLeopard and Panther; but it has been impossible to establish any\r\ncharacters which mark the difference between them. Size, colour, form,\r\nand position of spots have been resorted to, but age and locality have\r\nset all rules aside, and, therefore, in treating of them, I shall use\r\nthe term indiscriminately. Their extreme beauty, and their greater\r\ndocility, make them more interesting than the tiger; nevertheless, they,\r\nlike others of the feline tribe, should not be treated too unreservedly.\r\nTheir internal anatomy and dentition agree with those of the tiger, but\r\nthey are of smaller and slighter make, are natives of the East, but\r\nparticularly abundant in most parts of Africa. They are exceedingly\r\nactive and graceful; swim, climb trees, or slide along the ground like a\r\nsnake, and are very apt to spring upon their victims from the branches\r\nof trees. Their coat is of that beautiful shade of tawny, which forms so\r\ngood a contrast with their black rosettes, or spots.\r\n\r\nMy first personal acquaintance with leopards and panthers was made on\r\nthe leeward coast of Africa, and one of the latter brought by Mr.\r\nBowdich and myself in a living state to this country, at first delighted\r\nthe men of science, because, in his remarkably beautiful coat, they\r\nhoped to find characters which would mark the difference between these\r\ntwo animals; but as we produced skin after skin, they began again to\r\ndoubt, and the problem still remains unsolved. My history of the Ashanti\r\npanther has been so often repeated in various works, that I should\r\nhesitate to introduce it here, had it not more than once been presented\r\nto the public, in a form which did not originate with myself. The only\r\nother account from my own pen was supplied to Mr. Loudon, for his\r\nMagazine of Natural History, to which I now make a few additions.\r\n\r\nThe panther to which I allude, was one of two cubs, found in one of the\r\nforests of the kingdom of Ashanti. They were both taken to the king, and\r\nwhen Mr. Hutchison (the resident left in Kumasi by Mr. Bowdich) came to\r\nhead-quarters, his Majesty desired this one to be presented to the\r\nGovernor. He had suffocated his brother in a fit of romping, being much\r\nthe larger of the two, but he was extremely docile and good-tempered,\r\nand was led by a chain only, being let loose when eating was going\r\nforward, on which occasions he received his share; but he helped himself\r\nto a fowl once or twice, and as he always gave it up to his master, he\r\nwas occasionally employed to secure provisions when the natives surlily\r\nrefused a supply. He was one day sitting behind Mr. Hutchison, with his\r\nchin on the latter's shoulder, when this gentleman refreshed himself by\r\npouring some lavender water on his handkerchief. In an instant, this\r\npanther tore it out of his hand, as if in a state of ecstasy, nor ceased\r\nto roll over it till the cambric was in fragments.\r\n\r\nThe day after his arrival at Cape Coast, he was led into the hall where\r\nwe were all dining; and he received our salutations with apparent\r\npleasure. On one occasion he stood on his hind legs, and put his fore\r\npaws on the shoulders of an officer, who hastily retreated, and it was\r\namusing to see the unconquerable dread of him which assailed men who\r\nwere undaunted where men only were concerned. We named the panther \"Sai\"\r\nafter the king, and he was kept in a small court; his claws and teeth\r\nwere filed, and no live food was given to him. A boy was appointed to\r\nwatch him. He was perfectly harmless; and the only violence he evinced,\r\nwas when a servant pulled his food from him, and he then tore a piece\r\nout of the man's leg. Once he escaped, and dashed on to the ramparts,\r\nwhere he caused a scene of confusion which was quite laughable; the\r\nsentinels fled, the officers closed their doors, the castle gates were\r\nshut; but when he was tired of his scamper, the playful beast quietly\r\nlaid himself down under a gun carriage, and suffered his attendant to\r\nlead him away. At last he was allowed to roam at large, orders being\r\ngiven to prevent his going beyond the gates; and the boy was desired not\r\nto leave him. He, however, often fell asleep, on which occasions Sai\r\nwould come stealthily behind him as he sat upright, and knock him over\r\nwith a blow from his paw, when he wagged his tail with delight. His\r\nprincipal amusement was to stand on his hind legs, his fore paws resting\r\non the sill of one of the windows, his chin between them, and there\r\ncontemplate all that was going on in the town below. But this was also a\r\nfavourite pastime with my uncle's children; and there was not always\r\nroom for all, so they often pulled him down by the tail, and took his\r\nplace, without exciting his anger. His attachment to my uncle was very\r\ngreat, and he chiefly lived in his room. He missed him one day when he\r\nwas holding a great palaver in the hall, and wandered about in search of\r\nhim. The multitude prevented the panther from seeing his friend, and he\r\nwandered to other parts of the castle, among others to my room, where he\r\nlaid himself down with a disconsolate look. The palaver over, the\r\nGovernor returned to his room to write, and the door being open, he\r\nheard Sai coming slowly up the stairs. The panther started when he saw\r\nthe object of his search, and as he made one bound across the room, my\r\nuncle gave himself up for lost; but the affectionate creature nestled\r\nhis head into his master's shoulder, rubbed his cheek against him, and\r\nonly tried by caresses to evince his happiness. He was very fond of\r\nhiding himself under one of the sofas in the hall, where a rustling\r\nnoise, a protruding paw, or an occasional peep from behind the cover,\r\nalone betrayed his presence. The Governor was once entertaining some\r\nofficers from Elmina, when, in the midst of an animated discussion, they\r\nboth turned pale, and stopped speaking. Their host looked up--\"I beg\r\nyour pardon,\" said one of them, \"but are you aware what animal is now\r\nlying under that sofa?\" \"Sai,\" said my uncle, \"come and speak to these\r\ngentlemen.\" The panther walked up to them, and both darted behind the\r\nGovernor, nor did they feel comfortable when Sai was ordered back to his\r\nhiding-place. I bantered one of them about his fears when I met him at\r\ndinner; and he confessed that he had never been more frightened. One of\r\nthe drollest circumstances attending Sai's presence at the castle,\r\noccurred to a woman who swept the floor of the great hall every day\r\nbefore dinner was laid, with a little hand-broom, called a prah-prah.\r\nShe was engaged in her usual occupation, without knowing that Sai was\r\nthere, and stooping almost on all fours; when with a sudden impulse of\r\nfun, the panther jumped upon her back, and stood there, wagging his\r\ntail. Naturally supposing she was going to be devoured, the poor\r\nprah-prah woman screamed so violently as to bring the other servants,\r\nwhereupon they being of the same opinion as herself, and thinking their\r\nturn might come next, ran away; nor was she released till the governor,\r\nhearing the noise, came to her assistance.\r\n\r\nBefore Sai was put on board the vessel in which we were to sail\r\ntogether, we had become the best friends possible; and I and my uncle\r\ncoaxed him into the cage made for his accommodation. He was put into a\r\ncanoe, the men belonging to which were so alarmed when he moved, that\r\nthey upset the canoe, and the poor animal was plunged into the sea. We\r\nwere watching him from a window in the castle, and gave him up for lost;\r\nbut some of the sailors of the vessel, seeing the disaster, stepped into\r\na boat, and rescued him. He was so subdued by his ducking, and the\r\nuncomfortable dampness of his cage, for no one dared to open it to wipe\r\nit out, that he rolled himself up in the corner, and only, after an\r\ninterval of some days, was roused by my voice. When I first spoke he\r\nraised his head, held it first on one side then on the other, and when I\r\ncame fully into view, jumped upon his legs, and appeared frantic with\r\njoy; he rolled himself over and over, howled, opened his enormous jaws,\r\nand seemed as if he could tear his cage to pieces, in order to get close\r\nto me. Gradually, however, his violence subsided; he was amply caressed;\r\nand from that time, ate everything which was offered to him: perhaps he\r\nhad suffered from sea-sickness. I indulged him twice a week with some\r\nlavender water put into a cup made of stiff paper, but never allowed\r\nhim to have it when his claws were pushed forth; so that he learned to\r\nretract them at my bidding.\r\n\r\nWhile we lay for weeks in the river Gaboon, he was never suffered to\r\nleave his cage, because the deck was constantly filled with black\r\npersons, to whom he always manifested a decided aversion. I have already\r\nmentioned his rage at seeing a chimpanzee and monkeys, and only\r\nsecondary to this was the approach of pigs, whom he seemed to long to\r\ndevour.\r\n\r\nOn the voyage to England direct, I thought he would have been starved to\r\ndeath; for we were boarded by pirates, who took almost all our\r\nprovisions away, of course including our live stock, and if it had not\r\nbeen for the numerous parrots in the vessel, Sai must have met with a\r\nmelancholy death. Some died daily as we came into colder climates, and\r\nhe was allowed one each day. It was just enough to keep him from\r\nstarving, and this sometimes made him seize it so ravenously, that he\r\ndid not give himself time to pluck off the feathers; these in process of\r\ntime formed a hard substance within the intestines, which made him very\r\nill, he refused even his small portion of food, and I thought would have\r\ndied; but I made some pills of calomel, butter, and flour, and put them\r\nvery far down his throat, while his particular attendant, one of the\r\ncabin boys, held his jaws open. The boy slept in the cage with him all\r\nnight; and the next morning, I administered a further dose, which\r\neffected his cure.\r\n\r\nHaving, after a long absence from England, no accommodation for such an\r\ninmate, we, as speedily as possible, sought a home for him. He was\r\npresented to the duchess of York, who boarded him at Exeter Change, till\r\nshe herself was going to Oatlands. I visited him more than once; and it\r\nwas only by stratagem that I could get away without his following me.\r\nOne morning the duchess called and played with him, when he appeared to\r\nbe in perfect health. In the evening, when her coachman went to fetch\r\nhim, he was dead, and his malady _said_ to be inflammation of the lungs.\r\n\r\nThe Panther is considered as a sacred animal on the Gold Coast; and the\r\npriests demand a fine for each one that is killed; consequently, they\r\nand leopards (if there be any difference) are numerous, and occasionally\r\ncommit much mischief. They leap over high walls, or stockades, and take\r\naway the sheep and goats kept within, leaping back with them in their\r\nmouths. They come into the streets of the towns or villages at night,\r\nwhere I have often seen them jumping about, and chasing each other. Our\r\nchief surgeon had a house on the outskirts of the forest, that he might\r\nenjoy more room than he could have in barracks; and one night, while\r\nsleeping there, he thought he heard his servant boys (who generally\r\nremained all night in the verandah) dancing outside his bed-room door.\r\nHe called to them to be quiet, and for a minute or two the noise ceased;\r\nas this happened several times, he rose, took a large stick, opened his\r\ndoor a little way, in order to punish them, when, instead of his sable\r\nattendants, he saw two large panthers performing their own dance; and it\r\nis scarcely necessary to say, that he quickly closed his door, and\r\ntolerated the nuisance.\r\n\r\nA woman at Annamaboo was very much scarred on one arm and shoulder, in\r\nconsequence of a panther having sprung upon her when her child was at\r\nher back, and she was carrying a pitcher of water. The pitcher fell, and\r\nshe made so vigorous an attack upon his eyes, that he became bewildered,\r\nand retreated. This is not the only instance I have heard of wild and\r\nferocious animals being driven away by blows on this part.\r\n\r\nA little girl of fourteen, who was to have been my maid as soon as she\r\nwas old enough, was not as fortunate as her neighbour; she being\r\nattacked by a panther who sprang upon her through an open window, in a\r\nroom where she was sleeping by herself. Her cries brought her family\r\nround her, and the beast made his escape as he had entered, but having\r\nonce tasted blood there, he was sure to return, and a trap was made\r\nwhich caught him the ensuing night; the fine was paid, and the skin was\r\ngiven to me. The poor child had a piece of her scalp taken off, a\r\ntriangular morsel had been bitten from her shoulder; and her throat had\r\na gash on each side of her windpipe. All these wounds appeared as if\r\nthey had been cut with a knife; none of them were mortal, but she had\r\nnot strength to encounter the weakness they engendered. Her father\r\nbrought her in a canoe to head-quarters for the attendance of an English\r\nsurgeon, but she expired as she was carried ashore.\r\n\r\nA party of us had gone to St. Mary's near the mouth of the river Gambia;\r\nand in the evening a bright moonlight induced us to take a walk. It was\r\nnot very prudent; but we started, the commandant, a quaker lady and\r\nmyself, to the outskirts of the forest. My female companion after we had\r\nadvanced some distance, began to think of danger, and I, in mischief,\r\nrustled among the branches of the thicket in order to alarm her still\r\nmore. We proceeded as far as a spring under a huge Baobab, where we\r\nstood for some time, till the monkeys began to pelt us from the tree\r\nover our heads. A slight movement in the bushes also seemed to say it\r\nwas time to depart; and then, expatiating on our own fool-hardiness, we\r\nwent on, and reached home in safety. The next morning we were informed,\r\nthat an enormous leopard had been caught in a trap close to the spring,\r\nhalf an hour after we had been there, and his footsteps had been traced\r\nupon mine in the sand. We never could understand, humanly speaking, what\r\nsaved us, unless it were the long white plumes which waved from the hat\r\nof the commandant. These traps are generally pitfalls, baited, too\r\noften, with a live kid, whose cries entice the beast of prey.\r\n\r\nThe Jaguar is the leopard of America, and is also very destructive at\r\ntimes; hunger, however, is the prompter; and Baron Humboldt relates a\r\nstory of a native woman, whose children used to play daily with one\r\nwhich came from the forest close by. She discovered it in consequence of\r\nthe cry of one of the children, who received a scratch in play from\r\ntheir companion, who was a little too rough. Had he required a supper,\r\nthe wound would probably have been more than a scratch. D'Azara,\r\nhowever, says, he is a very ferocious animal; causing great destruction\r\namong horses and asses. He is extremely fond of eggs, and goes to the\r\nshores frequented by turtles, and digs them out of the sand.\r\n\r\nTwo of the early settlers in the western states of America, a man and\r\nhis wife closed their wooden hut, and went to pay a visit at a distance,\r\nleaving a freshly killed piece of venison hanging inside.\r\n\r\nThe gable end of this house was not boarded up as high as the roof, but\r\na large aperture was left for light and air. By taking an enormous\r\nleap, a hungry jaguar, attracted by the smell of the venison, had\r\nentered the hut, and devoured part of it; he was disturbed by the return\r\nof the owners, and took his departure. The venison was removed: the\r\nhusband went away the night after to a distance, and left his wife alone\r\nin the hut. She had not been long in bed before she heard the jaguar\r\nleap in at the open gable; there was no door between her room and that\r\nin which he had entered, and she knew not how to protect herself. She,\r\nhowever, screamed as loudly as she could, and made all the violent\r\nnoises she could think of, which served to frighten him away at that\r\ntime; but she knew he would come again, and she must be prepared for\r\nhim. She tried to make a large fire; but the wood was expended. She\r\nthought of rolling herself up in the bed clothes; but these would be\r\ntorn off. The idea of getting under the low bedstead suggested itself,\r\nbut she felt sure a paw would be stretched forth which would drag her\r\nout: her husband had taken all their fire-arms. At last, as she heard\r\nthe jaguar this time scrambling up the end of the house, she, in\r\ndespair, got into a large store chest, the lid of which closed with a\r\nspring. Scarcely was she within it, and had dragged the lid down,\r\ninserting her fingers between it and the side of the chest, when the\r\njaguar discovered where she was; he smelt round the chest, tried to get\r\nhis head in through the crack, but fortunately he could not raise the\r\nlid; he found her fingers and began to lick them; she felt them bleed,\r\nbut did not dare to move them, for fear she should be suffocated. At\r\nlength the jaguar leaped on to the lid, and his weight, pressing down\r\nthe lid, fractured these fingers. Still she could not move, he smelt\r\nround again, he pulled, he leaped on and off, till, at last, getting\r\ntired of his vain efforts, he went away. The poor woman lay there till\r\ndaybreak, and then only, feeling safe from her enemy, she went as fast\r\nas her strength would let her to the nearest neighbour's, a distance of\r\ntwo miles, where she procured help for her wounded fingers, which were\r\nlong getting well. On his return, her husband found a male and female\r\njaguar in the forest close by, with their cubs; and all were destroyed.\r\n\r\nAs proof that these animals are as soon startled as the tiger, we are\r\ntold of an Indian, who saw a fierce-looking jaguar standing directly in\r\nhis path, at a distance of ten paces. At first he was extremely puzzled\r\nto know what to do; but a sudden impulse prompted him to take off his\r\nbroad brimmed hat, make a low bow, and say, \"A very good morning to you,\r\nSir;\" and to his surprise, the jaguar turned round, and walked leisurely\r\naway.\r\n\r\nA very beautiful Ounce lived in the menagerie of the Jardin des Plantes,\r\nin Paris, which became extremely tame; and Mdlle. Cuvier and I used\r\nvery often to go and take him a walk, leading him from his den to a\r\nsmall space surrounded by high stakes: he required no other confinement\r\nto ensure his obedience, than twisting our hands in the loose skin of\r\nhis neck, and he never failed at all times to recognise us with pleasure\r\nif we went into his vicinity.\r\n\r\nThe Cheetah is gentle and affectionate, and successfully trained for\r\nhunting.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCATS.\r\n\r\n\r\nCats are diminished examples of the feline race; but their fur is longer\r\nthan that of others, and they bear a greater resemblance to leopards\r\nthan to lions. The idea of majesty is not connected with them, but they\r\nare celebrated for grace, elegance, suppleness, and insidiousness. There\r\nis yet a wild species in existence, which inhabits the mountainous and\r\nwooded districts of the northern part of England, and also Scotland,\r\nwhere it used formerly to be very abundant. It is scarcely necessary to\r\ngive a description, even of the untamed species, so well known are the\r\ngeneral characters of these animals. It will be quite sufficient to say,\r\nthat the head of the latter is triangular, the soles of the feet of the\r\nmale are always black, their tails are bushy, they spring furiously upon\r\nwhoever approaches, and utter unearthly cries. Mr. St. John, when\r\nwalking up to his knees in heather, over broken ground, came suddenly\r\nupon a wild cat. She rushed out between his legs, every hair standing\r\nup. He cut a good sized stick; and three Skye terriers gave chase till\r\nshe took refuge in a corner, spitting and growling. On trying to\r\ndislodge her, she flew at Mr. St. John's face, over the dog's heads; but\r\nhe struck her while in the air, and she fell among the dogs, who soon\r\ndispatched her, even though they say, that a wild-cat has twelve instead\r\nof nine lives. If one be taken, those in the neighbourhood are sure to\r\nbe also secured, as they will all, in the manner of foxes, assemble\r\nround the body of their relation.\r\n\r\nDomestic cats often run away to the woods and subsist on their own\r\nhunting; but these are not to be taken for the real wild cat. The female\r\nof the latter is the smaller of the two, and retires into the fissures\r\nof rocks, or takes possession of some large bird's nest, when she is\r\nabout to have young ones. They are found all through Germany, Russia,\r\nHungary, and the North of Asia, where their fur is much more valued than\r\nit is here, probably on account of the length and quality of the hair.\r\n\r\nOur house cats are, by most naturalists, supposed not to have descended\r\nfrom the above wild species. Professor Temminck ascribes their origin\r\nto the Nubian cat, found in that country by M. Rueppell, but Mr. Bell\r\ndiffers from him.\r\n\r\nCats were numerous in Egypt, where they were much prized, and honoured\r\nwith being embalmed. In Abyssinia they form part of a marriage dowry,\r\nfor fear the mice should eat up the other portions. Nevertheless, it\r\nwill be perhaps more like the truth if we give our cats an Asiatic\r\norigin. When they run wild, Mr. St. John says, they are often\r\nirreclaimable, and do incredible mischief. There are instances, however,\r\nof their returning to their homes bringing game with them. One known to\r\nthe above gentleman, used every winter evening to bring in a woodcock;\r\nanother brought back rabbits and hares; the latter was constantly caught\r\nin traps, which accident did not cure him of his wanderings, and he\r\nnever struggled, but sat quietly till some one came and effected his\r\nrelease.\r\n\r\nAll cats sleep slightly, raise their back, bristle up their hair, and\r\nswell up their tail when angry. Those which have been domesticated are\r\nvery inquisitive concerning things rather than persons; smell, and\r\ninspect a new piece of furniture several times; are attached to houses,\r\nand are extremely fond of scents, especially certain kinds emanating\r\nfrom plants. They seldom eat the rats which they kill, although they\r\ndevour mice. If they should swallow a shrew, which is very rare, they\r\nalmost immediately reject it. They will sit hour after hour watching at\r\nthe mouth of a hole, and after seizing their prey, bring it to their\r\nfavourites in the house to show their prowess, and strut about with a\r\ngreat air of self-satisfaction. They generally have a great dislike to\r\nwater; but they have been known to surmount this when they could catch a\r\nfish, for which species of food they have a great preference. The\r\naccusation that they play with you one minute, and scratch you the next,\r\nis too true: the change is not an act of treachery, but arises from\r\nexcitement.\r\n\r\nI know not whence it is derived; but for centuries cats have been\r\nconnected with superstition and sorcery. They have always been regarded\r\nas attendants upon witches; and witches themselves have been said to\r\nborrow their shapes when on their mysterious expeditions. I was once\r\ntold, that Lord Cochrane was accompanied by a favourite black cat in a\r\ncruise through the northern seas. The weather had been most\r\nunpropitious; no day had passed without some untoward circumstance, and\r\nthe sailors were not slow in attributing the whole to the influence of\r\nthe black cat on board. This came to Lord Cochrane's ears, and knowing\r\nthat any attempt to reason his men out of so absurd a notion was\r\nperfectly useless, he offered to sacrifice this object of his regard,\r\nand have her thrown overboard. This, however, far from creating any\r\nsatisfaction, only alarmed the men still more; they were sure that the\r\ntempests she would then raise would be much worse than any they had yet\r\nencountered; and they implored his lordship to let her remain\r\nunmolested. \"There was no help, and they could only hope, if she were\r\nnot affronted, they might, at the end of their time, reach England in\r\nsafety.\"\r\n\r\nBlack cats were always more especially connected with superstitious\r\nfeelings, and I was once accosted by a peasant's wife, who, with a phial\r\nin her hand to contain it, requested I would give her a few drops of\r\nblood from the tail of my black kitten; not only to bring luck to her\r\nhearth, but to keep pestilence from her doors. Even lately, a working\r\nwoman told me not to turn a stray black cat from my house; for, if I\r\ndid, I should never have any prosperity afterwards. Captain Brown tells\r\nus that on Hallowe'en, it was usual in Scotland for families to tie up\r\ntheir cat, in order to preserve it from being used as a pony by the\r\nwitches that night. Those who neglected this precaution, ran the risk of\r\nseeing their cat scampering through the fields, with a witch on its\r\nback, on the high road to Norway. A black cat was commonly sacrificed by\r\nthe ancients to Hecate, or among the Scandinavians to Frea, the northern\r\nHecate. A black cat, sent with a prayer-book and a bag of sand into a\r\nnew house, so as to precede the proprietor in possession, was formerly\r\ndeemed essential to ensure prosperity to the person changing his abode.\r\nTo steal a black cat, and bury it alive, is in the Irish Highlands,\r\nconsidered as a specific for a disorder in cattle, termed \"blacklegs,\"\r\nwhich otherwise proves fatal.\r\n\r\nThere is yet another peculiar feeling respecting cats--namely, the\r\nstrange antipathy which some persons entertain towards them, and is\r\nequally unassailable with that of superstition. Of course, in many\r\ninstances, illness and weak indulgence, have greatly increased it, but\r\nin some cases, it has been, unconsciously harboured, and in others\r\nunconquerable. A friend of mine told me, that through life this feeling\r\nhad accompanied him, in spite of every endeavour made to eradicate it.\r\nWhen a little boy he awoke one night, with that trembling and cold\r\nperspiration which always assailed him when a cat was in his vicinity;\r\nand, screaming for help, he intreated the servant who entered to take\r\naway the cat which was in the room. The man searched, but found no\r\ntraces of puss. His young master still persisted she was there, but a\r\nrenewed search proved equally unavailing, nor could he compose himself\r\nto rest unless the servant remained in the room till he was asleep. This\r\naccomplished, the man left him, and a second time my friend awoke in the\r\nsame manner, with the same appeals for assistance. They were obeyed; he\r\nhimself joined in the search, and he dragged out a cat from the close\r\nstove (for it was in Germany) which had taken refuge there, and been\r\nwholly unperceived by the man servant. This gentleman's daughter\r\ninherited the same antipathy, and neither the tenderest feelings towards\r\nother \"dumb creatures,\" or the strongest efforts of a mind of unusual\r\nstrength, could subdue the uncomfortable and distressing sensation which\r\nthrilled through her when a cat was in her presence.\r\n\r\nWhere every house has a cat, many two, where every female cat, at least\r\ntwice in each year, brings forth a litter of from three to five kittens,\r\nwhich are not all drowned, some idea may be formed of the untellable\r\nnumber of cats in London; but it is only the dwellers in what is called\r\na quiet out-of-the-way street in the metropolis, who can form any notion\r\nof the noise and caterwaulings of this part of the population. All cats,\r\non first taking possession with their owners, of a house, are obliged to\r\nenter into an alliance, offensive and defensive, with the older\r\ninhabitants of the neighbourhood. In some instances the amicable\r\narrangements, though less noisy, are the most troublesome, of which I\r\nwas convinced in one of my dwellings. The back overlooked a number of\r\ngardens, some of which were large, and to enjoy these sufficiently, a\r\nsmall, leaded terrace was thrown out from the back drawing-room window.\r\nHere all the cats of all the gardens, the street, and the opposite\r\nsquare, used to hold their _conversazione_; and I presume, that my cats\r\nwere particularly amiable, for often, if the drawing-room window had\r\nbeen left open during our absence, we found a select few, perhaps five\r\nor six, sitting within its precincts, as if in friendly talk.\r\n\r\nEvery cat that comes to a new area in London, appears to me to be\r\nobliged to fight till he gains undisturbed possession of it; at least so\r\nit has been the case with my cats. A very fine, bold, powerful tabby,\r\ndid this twice with perfect success; but after repeated combats,\r\nalthough victorious, the struggle made him fierce and occasionally\r\nsullen. Another who was a very beautiful creature, but much weaker, used\r\nto come in with his handsome ears slit, his cheeks swollen, his fur torn\r\noff, his frolic and vivacity gone; and he sat crouching by the fire all\r\nday. At night he was roused by the fierce defiance of his enemies; and\r\nthe contest continued till he died from his exertions.\r\n\r\nOne cat belonging to me had a curious manner of shewing her\r\ndisappointment or anger, whichever it might be; for the instant she was\r\naffronted, she walked away and seated herself with her back to the\r\noffending parties. A child of hers was an instance of the effect of\r\njudicious education, for fair and gentle treatment transformed her, from\r\na violent, outrageous kitten, to a well behaved cat, and it was curious\r\nto see the instantaneous effect which the voice of his preceptress\r\nproduced. Cats will learn all sorts of antics, and form all sorts of\r\ncontradictory attachments; young birds, puppies, rats and mice\r\nfrequently being the objects. My mother-in-law had both a favourite\r\ncanary and an equally beloved cat; the former lived in her bed room; and\r\nwhen alone, she suffered him to fly about the room, for she could there\r\nexclude the latter. Chance, however, discovered that puss was as fond of\r\nthe canary as she was; and, to her surprise, on raising her head from\r\nher work one morning, she saw the bird perched upon the cat's body,\r\nwithout fear, and the cat evidently delighted. After that there was no\r\nfurther restraint, and the two pets were daily companions. Their\r\nmistress, however, received another fright; for Puss gave a slight\r\ngrowl, and seizing the bird in her mouth, leaped on to the bed; her tail\r\nswelled out, her hair erect, and her eyes as big as four. The bird was\r\nof course given up for lost: but the door being accidentally left open,\r\na strange cat had come in; and it was for the preservation of the bird,\r\nthat the cat had seized him, and as soon as the intruder was driven\r\naway, she set the prisoner at liberty. Cats have often been trained to\r\nact as game-finders, without offering the slightest damage to their\r\ncapture; they have given the alarm when thieves have been breaking in;\r\nand manifested great proofs of reflection and thought, which may be\r\ncalled reason, without degrading this act of the intellect. One\r\nbelonging to my sister invariably goes to her room when she rings her\r\nbell; but does not offer to stir when any other bell in the house is\r\nsounded. Another, in the service of a friend, was in the habit of going\r\ninto the garden, catching a bird, and bringing it to the cook,\r\nappearing to ask her to dress it; and yet it was perfectly her own\r\nsuggestion.\r\n\r\nA brother of mine had a favourite tortoise-shell cat, named Monkey, who\r\nalways sat on his shoulder when he was shaving, and evinced every sign\r\nof deep attachment. He left her under the care of some friends when he\r\nwent abroad; and, two years after, these ladies were surprised the\r\nevening he was expected home, at the extreme restlessness of the animal.\r\nShe heard the arrival of the carriage at the garden gate before they\r\ndid; and ere the bell was rung, she was furious to be let out to meet\r\nhim. Her joy was indescribable; and the next morning she took her place\r\non his shoulder as usual, when she saw him prepare his razor. Such\r\nattachments have been known to continue after death; and cats have died\r\nof grief on their master's grave.\r\n\r\nI have already noticed a great friendship between a pug dog and a cat;\r\nand the following proof of a similar strength of love is taken from the\r\npages of M. Wenzel, in his \"Observations on the Language of Brutes.\" \"I\r\nhad a cat and a dog, which became so attached to each other, that they\r\nwould never willingly be asunder. Whenever the dog got any choice morsel\r\nof food, he was sure to divide it with his whiskered friend. They always\r\nate socially out of one plate, slept in the same bed, and daily walked\r\nout together. Wishing to put this apparently sincere friendship to the\r\nproof, I one day, took the cat by herself into my room, while I had the\r\ndog kept in another apartment. I entertained the cat in a most sumptuous\r\nmanner; being desirous to see what sort of meal she would make without\r\nher friend, who had been hitherto her constant table companion. The cat\r\nenjoyed the treat, and seemed entirely to have forgotten the dog. I had\r\nhad a partridge for dinner, half of which I intended to keep for supper.\r\nMy wife covered it with a plate, and put it into a cupboard, the door of\r\nwhich she did not lock. The cat left the room, and I walked out on\r\nbusiness; my wife meanwhile sat at work in an adjoining apartment. When\r\nI returned home, she related to me the following circumstances:--The cat\r\nhaving hastily left the dining-room, went to the dog, and mewed\r\nunusually loudly, and in different tones; which the dog, from time to\r\ntime, answered with a short bark. They went together to the door of the\r\nroom where the cat had dined, and waited till it was opened. The two\r\nfriends then immediately entered the apartment. My wife rose from her\r\nseat, went softly to the door which stood ajar, to observe what was\r\ngoing on. The cat led the dog to the cupboard which contained the\r\npartridge, pushed off the plate which covered it, and taking out my\r\nintended supper, laid it before her canine friend, who devoured it\r\nquickly.\"\r\n\r\nThe following anecdote almost places the cat on a level with the\r\ndog:--\"A physician of Lyons was requested to inquire into a murder that\r\nhad been committed on a woman of that city. In consequence of this\r\nrequest, he went to the habitation of the deceased, where he found her\r\nextended lifeless on the floor, weltering in her blood. A large white\r\ncat was mounted on the cornice of a cupboard, at the far end of the\r\napartment, where he seemed to have taken refuge. He sat motionless with\r\nhis eyes fixed on the corpse, and his attitude and looks expressing\r\nhorror and affright. The following morning he was found in the same\r\nstation and attitude, and when the room was filled with officers of\r\njustice, neither the clattering of the soldier's arms, nor the loud\r\nconversation of the company, could in the least degree divert his\r\nattention. As soon, however, as the suspected persons were brought in,\r\nhis eyes glared with increased fury, his hair bristled, he darted into\r\nthe middle of the apartment, where he stopped for a moment to gaze at\r\nthem, and then precipitately retreated under the bed. The countenances\r\nof the assassins were disconcerted, and they were now, for the first\r\ntime, abandoned by their audacious atrocity.\"\r\n\r\nThere are several instances on record of cats finding their way back to\r\ntheir former abodes under circumstances of great difficulty, and the\r\nfollowing appears to me to be one of the most striking of them, and\r\nquoted from a letter:--\"When living at Four Paths, Clarendon, Jamaica,\r\nI wanted a cat, and had one given to me, which was nearly full grown; it\r\nwas brought from Morgan's Valley Estate, where it was bred, and had\r\nnever been removed from that place before. The distance was five miles.\r\nIt was put into a canvass bag, and carried by a man on horseback.\r\nBetween the two places there are two rivers, one of them about eighty\r\nfeet broad and two feet and a half deep, running strong; the other is\r\nwider and more rapid, but less deep; over these rivers are no bridges.\r\nThe cat was shut up at Four Paths for some days, and when considered to\r\nbe reconciled to her new dwelling, she was allowed to go about the\r\nhouse. The day after obtaining her liberty, she was missing; and, upon\r\nmy next visiting the estate she was brought from, I was quite amazed to\r\nlearn that the cat had come back again. Did she swim over the rivers at\r\nthe fords where the horse came through with her, or did she ascend the\r\nbanks for a considerable distance, in search of a more shallow place,\r\nand where the stream was less powerful? At all events she must have\r\ncrossed the rivers, in opposition to her natural habits.\"\r\n\r\nA singular malformation in the cat has been perpetuated, till a race of\r\ntailless cats is now in existence, and which is certainly no improvement\r\non the original stock; for nothing can be more graceful than the\r\nattitudes of the cat's tail, or more expressive of its feelings of joy\r\nor anger.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSQUIRRELS.\r\n\r\n\r\nA peculiar formation of the incisors, or front teeth, groups a number\r\nof smaller animals together under the name of Rodentia, from the Latin\r\nword _rodens_, which signifies gnawing. These teeth act as files, so\r\nthat the food on which their owners principally live is reduced by\r\nfriction to a state which fits it for digestion. As the edges of these\r\nteeth become worn by constant use, they incessantly grow from the root.\r\nIf one be broken, that opposite to it, in the other jaw, being deprived\r\nof its habitual wear and tear, grows so fast that it not only annoys its\r\nowner, but has caused his destruction by effectually closing the mouth.\r\nTheir lower jaws can only move backwards and forwards; some exclusively\r\neat vegetables, others eat all things, and others again prefer flesh.\r\nSome carry their food to their mouths with their paws, and climb trees;\r\nand, in many, the hinder limbs are so much longer than those in front,\r\nthat they leap instead of walk. They are widely and numerously spread on\r\nthe surface of the earth, and therefore bear strongly on its history;\r\nbut it is not among them that we find the high intellectual development\r\nwith which many other animals are gifted.\r\n\r\nSquirrels are some of the most beautiful of the Rodentia, and chiefly\r\nlive in trees. The fur of some of the species is extremely beautiful and\r\nvaluable; they are very active, elegant little creatures, and easily\r\ntamed, when they become very playful and affectionate. A friend of mine\r\nwas deprived of her only daughter, and the lost one's pet squirrel was\r\nof course cherished and loved; the little creature used to run up the\r\nlady's arm, and seat itself on her shoulder, caress her with its head,\r\nnestle itself into her neck, and drink her tears. As long as it lived,\r\nit was never caressed by the mother without first looking in her face\r\nfor the drops, which it had been accustomed to remove.\r\n\r\nThese animals have a large bushy tail, the hair of which spreads out on\r\neach side like a feather; and by it they are guided and supported when\r\nthey leap. The flying squirrels, as they are called, have an expansion\r\nof the skin of the sides, which extends between the hind and fore legs,\r\nby which they are suspended in the air when passing from tree to tree,\r\nand by it are enabled to go to greater distances without being actually\r\nable to fly, as their name would imply. The general colour of the\r\nEnglish squirrel is red in summer; but in winter they often assume a\r\ngrayish tint, at which time they have long pencils of hair at the top of\r\ntheir ears. This grey becomes more decided in more northern climates;\r\nand occasionally they are black. They always live in pairs, and\r\nsometimes are gregarious, inhabiting burrows. They lay up stores of\r\nprovisions in different places; but they sleep the greater part of the\r\ncold months, their tail turned over them to keep them warm, having\r\nbeforehand made a very elaborate nest of moss, leaves, and interlacing\r\nfibres in the hole of a tree, or the fork of two branches. They\r\nexclusively eat vegetable food, and are occasionally themselves eaten by\r\nthe larger birds of prey.\r\n\r\nSir Francis Head gives us the following account of his meeting with a\r\nsquirrel in Canada. \"I was waiting the approach of a large flock of wild\r\nfowl; but a little villain of a squirrel on the bough of a tree close to\r\nme, seemed to have determined that even now I should not rest in quiet;\r\nfor he sputtered and chattered with so much vehemence, that he attracted\r\nthe attention of my dog. This was truly mortifying; for he kept his eyes\r\nfixed on the squirrel. With my hand I threatened the little beast; but\r\nhe actually set up his back and defied me, becoming even more passionate\r\nthan before; till, all of a sudden, as if purposely to alarm the game,\r\nhe dropped plump within a couple of yards of Rover's nose. This was too\r\nmuch for the latter to bear, so he gave a bounce and sprang upon the\r\nimpertinent squirrel; who, in a second, was out of his reach, cocking\r\nhis tail and shewing his teeth, on the identical bough where he had sat\r\nbefore. Away flew all the wild fowl, and my sport was completely marred.\r\nMy gun went involuntarily to my shoulder to shoot the squirrel; but I\r\nfelt I was about to commit an act of sheer revenge on a courageous\r\nlittle animal, which deserved a better fate. As if aware of my\r\nhesitation, he nodded his head with rage, and stamped his fore paws on\r\nthe tree; while in his chirruping, there was an intonation of sound,\r\nwhich seemed like contempt. What business had I there trespassing on his\r\ndomain, and frightening his wife and little family, for whom he was\r\nready to lay down his life? There he would sit in spite of me, and make\r\nmy ears ring with the sound of his woo-whoop, till the spring of life\r\nshould cease to bubble in his little heart.\"\r\n\r\nIt is from Captain Brown's pages that I extract the following. \"A\r\ngentleman procured a squirrel from a nest, found at Woodhouse, near\r\nEdinburgh, which he reared and rendered extremely docile. It was kept in\r\na box below an aperture, where was suspended a rope, by which the animal\r\nascended and descended. The little creature used to watch very narrowly\r\nall its master's movements; and, whenever he was preparing to go out, it\r\nran up his legs, and entered his pocket, from whence it would peep out\r\nat passengers as he walked along the streets, never venturing however to\r\ngo out.\r\n\r\n\"But no sooner would he reach the outskirts of the city, than the\r\nsquirrel leaped on the ground, ran along the road, ascended to the tops\r\nof trees and hedges with the quickness of lightning, and nibbled at the\r\nleaves and bark; and, if the gentleman walked on, it would descend,\r\nscamper after him, and again enter his pocket. Whenever it heard a\r\ncarriage or cart, it became much alarmed, and always hid itself till\r\nthey had passed by. This gentleman had a dog, between which and the\r\nsquirrel, a certain enmity existed. Whenever the dog lay asleep, the\r\nsquirrel showed its teasing disposition by rapidly descending from its\r\nbox, scampering over the dog's body, and then quickly mounting its\r\nrope.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRATS.\r\n\r\n\r\nSome persons profess to think that the Rodents called Rats are beautiful\r\nanimals; and I presume that, prejudice apart, the sleek skin, the sharp\r\nhead, the long, slender tail, and the keen look of their bright black\r\neyes, ought to be attractions; but those who have been annoyed with\r\nthese animals as I have been, can scarcely regard them with anything but\r\ndislike. Overspreading the whole world as they do, it is no wonder,\r\nwhere they are not vigorously checked, and where food is abundant, their\r\nnumbers should amount to something frightful. On a visit to Sierra\r\nLeone, I was all day at the Government House, and going to an upper\r\nroom to make my toilette, I heard a pattering of little feet close to\r\nme, and turning my head I saw between the floor and the shrunken door of\r\nthe next apartment, a whole army of rats on a peregrination, and giving\r\nsuch an idea of number, that, uninitiated as I then was (it being on my\r\nfirst journey to Africa), I was perfectly appalled, and most thankful\r\nthat I returned that night to sleep in my safer cabin on board ship.\r\nThis, however, was but the beginning; and, in the next vessel which I\r\nentered, they were so numerous, that the next time she returned to port,\r\nshe was sunk for a time, as the only means of getting rid of them.\r\nBetween these creatures and the cockroaches, I thought my poor child and\r\nmyself must be devoured.\r\n\r\nThere is a facility given to the human mind to accommodate itself to all\r\ncircumstances, for which perhaps we are not sufficiently thankful; and\r\nit never was more strongly manifested than in my own case, for both fear\r\nand apprehension vanished with habit, and I became fearless of those\r\nanimated creatures which at first seemed to be the bane of my existence.\r\nWhen living in Cape Coast Castle, I used to see the rats come in troops\r\npast my door, walking over my black boys as they lay there, and who only\r\nturned themselves over to present the other sides of their faces and\r\nbodies, when the rats returned--and thought it a good joke. The\r\nfiercest encounter which I ever had with them was during one of those\r\nterrific storms, which are more furious between the tropics than\r\nelsewhere. I was then, however, under the Equator, in a native hut, and\r\nheard an exceeding rustling and movement all around me. To my terror, I\r\nperceived that these proceeded from a number of rats running up and down\r\nthe sides of the room in which I was to pass the night, and who shortly\r\nbegan to run over me; they being disturbed by the torrents of rain which\r\nwere then falling. The only weapon I could find was a shoe, and curling\r\nmyself into a large armchair, taken out of a French vessel, and covered\r\nwith blue satin damask, I sat prepared for my enemies, whom I dreaded\r\nmuch more than the lightning, which was flashing across the iron bars\r\nlaid upon the floor. I felt that the silk of my place of refuge was some\r\nsort of protection against this; but my own arm could alone save me from\r\nmy four-footed foes. Presently my husband came in, and saluted me with a\r\nshout of laughter, which, however, abated when he saw my antagonists.\r\nThe storm lulled for a while, and the rats retreated: we then crept\r\nwithin the curtains of bamboo cloth, which encircled a rude imitation of\r\na four-post bedstead, but I kept possession of my shoe. Weary with\r\nwatching, I closed my eyes, but was awakened by a tremendous flash of\r\nlightning, immediately followed by awful thunder and a tumultuous rush\r\nof rats. Some of them scrambled up the outside of the curtains; but\r\narms in hand I sat up, and directed by the noise, I hurled the invaders\r\nto the ground, till at length resistance, and the passing away of the\r\nstorm allowed me to sleep in peace.\r\n\r\nThese were the brown rats which infest every part of the world, but very\r\nmuch increased in size by their residence in a hot climate.\r\n\r\nBesides these brown rats, a bush rat, as it is called, infests the\r\nforests, and is about as large as a young pig. When I first saw this,\r\nand felt myself surrounded as it were, by familiar animals increased to\r\nsuch magnitude, by multitudes previously unknown to me, and others of\r\nwhich I had only heard, and yet none of us were devoured, I could not\r\nbut feel with tenfold depth the Creator's command, that man should have\r\nthe dominion over them all. His own strength alone could never enable\r\nhim to walk among them unharmed.\r\n\r\nThe principal characters which distinguish the rat remain in all\r\ncountries, but there are several species. The black rat is that which\r\nfirst inhabited this island; but it has been nearly driven out by the\r\nbrown, which is, without any foundation, termed the Norway rat. It came\r\nfrom India, Persia, etc., and is said to have appeared in Europe after a\r\ngreat earthquake in 1727. All are so eminently carnivorous, that they do\r\nnot make the least ceremony of devouring each other in times of\r\nscarcity; so that on one occasion, already spoken of, when I and my\r\ncompanions stood a chance of being starved ourselves, we felt sure that\r\nthe violent screams and struggles we heard going on among the rats\r\nbehind the planks, arose from the meals which the strong were making\r\nupon their more feeble brethren.\r\n\r\nRats are nocturnal in their habits, and like to live in subterranean, or\r\nmysterious abodes. They are found in islands lying in the midst of the\r\nocean, till the moment of their discovery to us, supposed not to have\r\nbeen visited by man, and yet the question still remains unsettled,\r\nwhether the differences which exist in rats were caused by locality, or\r\nwhether they were so from the beginning. There is now no known spot free\r\nfrom the Norway rat, and the greater the number, of course the more\r\nimpudent they become. In Ceylon, I am told, where they are innumerable,\r\nthey perch on the top of a chair, or screen, and sit there till\r\nsomething is thrown at them, at which they slowly retreat. A noise is\r\nheard in the verandah close by you, and you see a party of rats,\r\ndisputing with a dog for the possession of some object. A traveller in\r\nCeylon saw his dogs set upon a rat, and making them relinquish it, he\r\ntook it up by the tail, the dogs leaping after it the whole time; he\r\ncarried it into his dining-room, to examine it there by the light of the\r\nlamp, during the whole of which period it remained as if it were dead;\r\nlimbs hanging, and not a muscle moving. After five minutes he threw it\r\namong the dogs, who were still in a state of great excitement; and to\r\nthe astonishment of all present, it suddenly jumped upon its legs, and\r\nran away so fast that it baffled all its pursuers.\r\n\r\nOne evening, when at Bathurst, St. Mary's, I was sitting at work in an\r\nupper room, and in the midst of the stillness, heard somewhat breathing\r\nclose to me. There was no other person in the chamber except my child,\r\nwho was asleep in bed. Although startled, I did not move, but casting my\r\neyes round I saw a huge rat, sitting upon the table at my elbow,\r\nwatching every movement of my fingers. I could scarcely help laughing at\r\nhis cool impudence, and suppose I had been too much absorbed by thought,\r\nor employment, to notice his approach. I gradually laid down my work,\r\nand slipping quietly out of the room, as if I had not perceived him,\r\ncalled the servants. It was supposed that there were nests of rats in\r\nthe chimney; for that Government House had been wisely provided with the\r\npossibility of having fires in the rooms during the rainy season; and\r\nthe hunt began. I jumped on to the bed, not only to be out of the way,\r\nbut to keep the rats from the place where my child was. Two of the men,\r\nfurnished with sticks, routed the enemy from their hiding-places, and\r\nfour others squatted at the corners of the room, holding a cloth spread\r\nbetween their hands. They said it was most likely the rats would run\r\nround the walls, and they should therefore catch them in the open cloth.\r\nThe event proved them to be right; the frightened animals rushed to\r\nthem, were immediately enclosed, and their necks were wrung in a moment.\r\nAfter the hunt was ended, they were thrown over the verandah into the\r\ngarden, to the number of at least fifty. In the morning, however, they\r\nwere all gone, but the footmarks of the Genet cats told how they had\r\nbeen removed. Some squeaks the next day in the chimney betrayed the\r\npresence of some very young ones, and a fire of damp grass being\r\nlighted, their destruction was completed by suffocation. This was\r\nperhaps cruel, but it was necessary in self-defence; and I shuddered to\r\nthink of how I and my daughter might, in our sleep, have been attacked\r\nby these animals. It is not to be wondered at, when surrounded by\r\nmyriads of obnoxious animals, how any tender feelings towards that part\r\nof creation become blunted. At the moment of which I speak, valuable\r\nbooks, dried plants, papers containing the data of scientific\r\nobservations, concerning the survey of the river Gambia to a\r\nconsiderable distance, were destroyed during the illness of the\r\nobserver, by rats and insects.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LEADING THE BLIND RAT.--Page 261.]\r\n\r\nOne afternoon, the commandant of Bathurst was quietly reading, when he\r\nheard a violent squeaking and hissing in the room below him, which was\r\neven with the ground, and contained stores. He took the key, and\r\nfollowed by his servants armed with sticks, went to ascertain the cause.\r\nOn opening the door they beheld a rat and a venomous serpent engaged in\r\nmortal combat. Nothing could be more beautiful than the action of both\r\nanimals; the rat had retreated for a moment, and stood with flashing\r\neyes; the head of the serpent was reared to receive a fresh attack;\r\nagain and again they closed and separated, but the reptile, although\r\nmuch bitten, gained the victory; the rat fell, foamed at the mouth,\r\nswelled to a great size, and died in a very few minutes. The serpent\r\nglided away, but was afterwards discovered in her nest with several\r\nyoung ones, in a crack of the store-room wall, close to a staircase,\r\nwhich we were in the habit of descending daily, and where, in fact, I\r\nhad often seen the serpents' heads peeping out, and had waited till they\r\nwere withdrawn.\r\n\r\nOf the brown rat Mr. Jesse tells the following story:--\"The Rev. Mr.\r\nFerryman, walking out in some meadows one evening, observed a great\r\nnumber of rats in the act of migrating from one place to another, which\r\nit is known, they are in the habit of doing occasionally. He stood\r\nperfectly still, and the whole assemblage passed close to him. His\r\nastonishment, however, was great, when he saw an old blind rat, which\r\nheld a piece of stick at one end in its mouth, while another rat had\r\nhold of the other end of it, and thus conducted his blind companion.\"\r\n\r\nThe amount of destructive force possessed by rats, cannot be better\r\nexemplified than in the report given to the French Government, relating\r\nto the removal of the horse slaughter-houses, situated at Montfaucon, to\r\na greater distance from Paris; one great objection being the disastrous\r\nconsequences which might accrue to the inhabitants of the neighbourhood,\r\nif these voracious creatures were suddenly deprived of their usual\r\nsustenance. It is well known, that the mischief which they occasion is\r\nnot confined to what they eat; but they undermine houses, burrow through\r\ndams, destroy drains, and commit incalculable havoc, in every place and\r\nin every thing.\r\n\r\nThe report states, that the carcases of horses killed one day, and\r\namounting to thirty-five, would be found the next morning with the bones\r\npicked clean. A person of the name of Dusaussois, belonging to the\r\nestablishment, made this experiment. A part of his yard was enclosed by\r\nsolid walls, at the foot of which, several holes were made for the\r\nentrance and exit of the rats. Into this enclosure he put the bodies of\r\nthree horses, and in the middle of the night he stopped up all the holes\r\nas quietly as he could; he then summoned several of his workmen, and\r\neach, armed with a torch and a stick, entered the yard, and carefully\r\nclosed the door. They then commenced a general massacre; in doing\r\nwhich, it was not necessary to take aim, for wherever the blow fell, it\r\nwas sure to knock over a rat, none being allowed to escape by climbing\r\nover the walls. This experiment was repeated at intervals of a few days,\r\nand at the end of a month, 16,050 rats had been destroyed. In one night\r\nthey killed 2,650; and yet this cannot give an entirely adequate idea of\r\ntheir number, for the yard in question did not cover more than a\r\ntwentieth part of the space allotted to killing horses. The rats in this\r\nplace have made burrows for themselves, like catacombs; and so great is\r\ntheir number, that they have not found room close by the\r\nslaughter-houses. They have gone farther; and the paths to and from\r\ntheir dwellings may be traced across the neighbouring fields.\r\n\r\nThe Zoological Gardens in the Regent's Park, are greatly infested by\r\nrats; but they are too cunning to stay there during the day time, when\r\nthey might be more easily caught; so they in the morning cross the canal\r\nto the opposite shore, and return in the evening to commit their\r\ndepredations.\r\n\r\nThe Water-rats, or Voles, eat fishes, frogs, and toads, besides other\r\nfood, and do infinite mischief to banks and dams, which they undermine.\r\nTheir smell is so acute, that they will not approach a trap over which a\r\nhand has been passed; and they are particularly abundant in all places\r\nwhere herrings are cured, leaving them when the season is over. The\r\nthing of all others which attracts rats of all kinds, is a piece of\r\nroast beef; of which they are so fond, that they have been known to kill\r\na companion who has eaten some, that they might devour the contents of\r\nhis stomach.\r\n\r\nDr. Carpenter was told by a trustworthy eyewitness, that she saw a\r\nnumber of rats safely convey some eggs down a flight of stairs, from a\r\nstore room, to their own dwellings. They stationed themselves on each\r\nstair, and each egg, held in the fore paws, was handed from one rat to\r\nanother the whole way. The rats who dipped their tails into a jar of\r\ntreacle, into which they could not dip their paws, and suffered their\r\ncompanions to lick them afterwards, is a well known story.\r\n\r\nRats have often attacked children who have been left in a room by\r\nthemselves; and infants have even lost their lives from the blood which\r\ntheir bites have caused to flow.\r\n\r\nThe following instance of sagacity deserves to be recorded. \"During the\r\ngreat flood of the 4th of September, 1829, when the river Tyne was at it\r\nheight, a number of people were assembled on its margin. A swan appeared\r\nwith a black spot upon its plumage, which on its nearer approach proved\r\nto be a live rat. It is probable, that the latter had been borne into\r\nthe water by some object, and observing the swan, had taken refuge on\r\nits back for safety. As soon as the swan reached the land, the rat\r\nleaped off and ran away.\"\r\n\r\nTwo ladies, friends of a near relative of my own, from whom I received\r\nan account of the circumstance, were walking in Regent-street, and were\r\naccosted by a man who requested them to buy a beautiful little dog,\r\ncovered with long, white hair, which he carried in his arms. Such things\r\nare not uncommon in that part of London, and the ladies passed on\r\nwithout heeding him. He followed, and repeated his entreaties, stating,\r\nthat as it was the last he had to sell, they should have it at a\r\nreasonable price. They looked at the animal; it was really an exquisite\r\nlittle creature, and they were at last persuaded. The man took it home\r\nfor them, received his money, and left the dog in the arms of one of the\r\nladies. A short time elapsed, and the dog, which had been very quiet, in\r\nspite of a restless, bright eye, began to show symptoms of uneasiness,\r\nand as he ran about the room, exhibited some unusual movements, which\r\nrather alarmed the fair purchasers. At last, to their great dismay, the\r\nnew dog ran squeaking up one of the window curtains, so that when the\r\ngentleman of the house returned home a few minutes after, he found the\r\nladies in consternation, and right glad to have his assistance. He\r\nvigorously seized the animal, took out his penknife, cut off its\r\ncovering, and displayed a large rat to their astonished eyes, and, of\r\ncourse to its own destruction.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMICE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe round, yet delicate form of the Mouse, and the better expression of\r\nits countenance, make it an object much more worthy of admiration than\r\nthe rat, of which it is but a diminished representative. It has the same\r\ndestructive propensities, assembles also in vast numbers, and is equally\r\ncarnivorous; but with all these, it is a more tamable and lovable\r\nanimal. There is a white variety which is often nurtured as a pet. Mr.\r\nDarwin says, that with other small Rodents, numbers live together in\r\nnearly desert places, as long as there are a few blades of vegetation\r\nleft; and that they swarm on the borders of salt-lakes, where not a drop\r\nof fresh water can be procured. Some of them lay up stores of food,\r\nespecially those which inhabit northern countries.\r\n\r\nField mice do an infinity of harm to young plantations, by nibbling off\r\nthe young shoots, and, in order to catch them, pits from eighteen to\r\ntwenty inches deep, are sunk in the soil, which are wider at the bottom\r\nthan the top, so that they cannot easily get out. One hundred thousand\r\nwere destroyed in this manner in the Forest of Dean, and about the same\r\nnumber in the New Forest. They make very beautiful round nests, of\r\ncuriously plaited blades of wheat, split into narrow strips with their\r\nteeth, and in them will often be found nine little mice. These nests are\r\nsuspended to some stalks, or thistles.\r\n\r\nI can bear witness to the possibility of taming mice, for I kept six in\r\na box for several months, which were so well fed, that they did not\r\nattempt to gnaw their dwelling. I had a sort of little cart constructed\r\nfor them, with bone buttons for wheels, and a packthread harness; and on\r\nbeing taken out of the box, they remained perfectly quiet till the\r\nharness was put upon them, and when that was done, they started at full\r\ngallop along the top of a square piano. Of course, care was taken to\r\nturn them back when they reached the end; but they soon learned to turn\r\nof their own accord, and performed their journey with as much regularity\r\nas well-trained horses. Death deprived me of my steeds; but I suspect it\r\nwas in consequence of the injudicious cramming which I bestowed upon my\r\nfavourites.\r\n\r\nDuring an illness of some week's duration, mice were to me a source both\r\nof amusement and annoyance; the former certainly predominating. A\r\nwainscot ledge ran round the room in which I lay, and it was their\r\ndelight to scamper after one another upon this projection; but as the\r\nhead of my curtain-less bed was close to it, they so frequently diverged\r\non to my face, that I was obliged to have it drawn at least a yard from\r\nthe wall. Sometimes also, they dragged away my pocket handkerchief,\r\nwhich, from not being immediately missed, was not recovered till sundry\r\nholes had been nibbled in it. A small table stood by my bed-side; having\r\non it a basin full of cold tea, which formed my night beverage. On one\r\noccasion, my light was extinguished, and I heard a scratching against\r\nthe legs of the table. I guessed the cause, and tried to frighten the\r\nclimber away; but I suspect he mounted by the bed clothes, for I\r\npresently heard something flop into the tea. All was silent; and I\r\nconcluded the intruder was drowned; but of course, whatever my thirst, I\r\ndid not attempt to drink. When daylight came, there sat a poor mouse,\r\nholding up his little chin just above the liquid. Had he moved he must\r\nhave been suffocated; and he had been all those hours in this position.\r\nIt was impossible to take away a life so hardly earned, and he was\r\nallowed to rejoin his companions.\r\n\r\nThe head-quarters of my mice seemed to be a large closet in one corner\r\nof the room, from which they constantly issued, and to which they\r\nretreated on the least alarm, for it was always accessible, in\r\nconsequence of the door not closing properly. They often appeared to me\r\nto hold a council, for they would sally forth in a body; not giddily,\r\nand as if by chance, but with all the gravity of diplomatic characters,\r\nand form a circle, when deliberations commenced. They were carried on\r\nin a language between a squeak and a chatter, and occasionally one would\r\nrise, and place himself in another part of the circle. I would have\r\ngiven a great deal to have understood what was going on; but as I could\r\nnot, I occasionally disturbed them by laughing, when they huddled back\r\nto the closet; and when I grew stronger, I sometimes dashed a pillow in\r\namong them, which made the poor senators breathless with agitation, and\r\nscuffle under the furniture, till they thought they might gain the\r\ncloset in safety. I little imagined the deeds committed in that\r\ndomicile, or I might not have been so indulgent to them; it was no less\r\nthan gnawing holes in some valuable antelope, monkey, and leopard skins,\r\nwhich were to have been sent to my friends by the next departing vessel.\r\n\r\nWhen I was allowed to eat, my appetite was kindly tempted by dainties\r\nsent to me by friends, and which were placed under tin covers, on the\r\ntop of a chest of drawers. The endeavours of my rodent companions to get\r\nat these were excessively droll; but as fast as they clambered an inch\r\nor two up the sides, the slippery metal caused them to slide down again;\r\nthen they thought if they could but get to the top of the cover, they\r\nshould succeed; so they mounted upon each others' shoulders, and\r\naccomplished the feat, but not their purpose; instead of getting\r\ninside, down they came in a body again, but they became so used to my\r\nlaughter, that they did not mind it. Many of them combined together to\r\npush the cover off the dish; but it was too firmly retained by the rim\r\nto be moved. One day they thought they had triumphed, for the cover was\r\nnot quite put down in one place. A summons was evidently given, and\r\npresently a number of little paws were inserted to raise it still\r\nhigher; but instead of doing this, the cover slipped on to their paws,\r\nand it was very ludicrous to see their pain and mortification. After\r\nthis they so far abandoned the attempt that only one would be\r\noccasionally seen walking round, as if by reconnoitering the fortress\r\nagain, his genius would suggest a successful termination to the\r\nenterprise.\r\n\r\nIn an American scientific journal, there is a well-authenticated account\r\nof a strange and overpowering sensibility to music, as evinced by a\r\nmouse. It says, \"that one evening, as a few officers on board a British\r\nman-of-war, in the harbour of Portsmouth, were seated round the fire,\r\none of them began to play a plaintive air upon the violin. He had\r\nscarcely performed ten minutes, when a mouse, apparently frantic, made\r\nits appearance in the centre of the floor. The strange gestures of the\r\nlittle animal strongly excited the attention of the officers, who, with\r\none consent, resolved to suffer it to continue its singular actions\r\nunmolested. Its exertions appeared to be greater every moment; it shook\r\nits head, leapt about, and exhibited signs of the most ecstatic delight.\r\nIt was observed that in proportion to the gradations of the tones to the\r\nsoft point, the feelings of the animal appeared to be increased. After\r\nperforming actions, which an animal so diminutive would, at first sight,\r\nseem incapable of, the little creature, to the astonishment of the\r\ndelighted spectators, suddenly ceased to move, fell down, and expired\r\nwithout evincing any symptoms of pain.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nELEPHANTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe extraordinary thickness of skin which distinguishes certain animals,\r\nhas induced naturalists to group them together, and call them\r\nPachydermata. This group is again divided according to the still further\r\npeculiarities which some of them possess; and in the first subdivision\r\nare elephants; distinguished by an enormous prolongation of the upper\r\nlip and nose, into what is termed a trunk, or proboscis. The largest\r\nanimals in the world are to be found among them; and according to some,\r\nthey are the most sagacious. There is, however, a strong inclination in\r\nmany to give the dog the highest place next to man, with regard to\r\nintellect.\r\n\r\nThe trunk of which I have just spoken, is formed of numbers of muscular\r\nfibres, amounting to at least 40,000, which take various directions, and\r\ncross each other in so many ways, that the whole forms one of the most\r\nflexible organs that can be conceived. It can be contracted, raised,\r\ndepressed, curved, turned, or twisted round any object at the will of\r\nits possessor; and can lay hold of, and pick up the most minute and the\r\nthinnest substance, aided in such instances by the prolongation of its\r\nupper edge into what is called a finger, which protects the nostrils,\r\nand acts as a feeler. This trunk serves as a reservoir for holding\r\nliquid, which can be put into the mouth at pleasure, by inserting the\r\nend between the jaws; or for retaining it as long as may be wished, when\r\nit is discharged over any object which the elephant desires to inundate.\r\nHe occasionally pours it upon his own body, thereby not only cooling and\r\nrefreshing himself, but getting rid of the numerous insects which lodge\r\nthemselves in his hide. The trumpet-like noise, for which elephants are\r\nremarkable, proceeds from their trunk, and it serves in other ways to\r\nexpress their feelings, for with it they bestow their caresses. A tame\r\nelephant, in the Jardin des Plantes, took a great fancy to a little\r\ngirl, who used to walk in the menagerie every morning with her nurse,\r\nbefore it was open to the public. It constantly happened that she and\r\nthe elephant would be met together, and not only was his care to avoid\r\ntrampling upon her most excessive, but if she were going the same way,\r\nhe would gently insinuate the end of his proboscis under her arm,\r\nlovingly rest it there, and walk by her side. Great pains are always\r\ntaken by these animals to guard their trunks from injury; and they\r\nconstantly raise them as high in the air as they can, to prevent their\r\ncoming in contact with any hurtful substance. With them food is procured\r\nand conveyed to the mouth; and they pull down, not only branches of\r\ntrees, but, in many instances, the trees themselves.\r\n\r\nThe immense skull and neck, and in fact, the size of the body, required\r\nto sustain the weight of this ponderous organ, and the tusks with which\r\nthey are provided, give elephants a clumsy, heavy look. The proportions\r\nof the head cause the eyes to look small; the weight of the head itself\r\nis, however, much diminished by the hollow cavities in front, which make\r\nit almost a vain attempt to try to kill an elephant by shooting him in\r\nthe forehead; for the balls lodge in these cells: they so protect the\r\nbrain, which is the seat of feeling, that fearful buttings are practised\r\nwith impunity by these animals.\r\n\r\nThe teeth of elephants are remarkable; for they consist of only one\r\nlarge grinder on each side, and in each jaw, which looks like a bundle\r\nof smaller teeth, fastened together by intervening and surrounding\r\nplates of enamel. These grinders change frequently during the life of\r\nthe animal, perhaps even six or eight times, as long as the jaw grows;\r\nand the new arrivals do not come from below, but are formed behind the\r\nold one, and push it out. There are no other teeth, properly so called,\r\nbut in the upper jaw are two tusks, which supply the ivory of commerce,\r\nand which are changed once during the life of the animal. Their enormous\r\nweight and size are almost fabulous, and combined with the trunk, make\r\nus cease to wonder that the whole body should have strength alone as its\r\nattribute, and be entirely wanting in grace. One of these tusks, sold at\r\nAmsterdam, weighed 350 pounds, and with such weapons as these, aptly\r\ncalled _defenses_ by the French, they are able to uproot enormous trees,\r\nand catching their heaviest foes upon them, hurl them to the ground, or\r\ntransfix them so as never to rise again. The ears are large, and hang\r\nflapping over the shoulders, and are very sensible to the touch; the\r\nhearing seems to be much more alive to grave than to acute sounds.\r\n\r\nFour ungraceful, stiff columns, for legs, support the clumsy body. On\r\neach fore foot there are five toes, and on each hind foot four; each toe\r\nshould shew a hoof, but sometimes the skin envelops and conceals them.\r\nThe sole is nearly round; and the skin of a foot exhibited by Mr. Gordon\r\nCumming, is so large, that a child of three years of age could easily\r\nseat itself within it. The tail is small in circumference, flattened at\r\nthe end, and has thick, stiff bristles at the extremity. These tails are\r\nsometimes used as whips, and at the court of Ashanti, when decorated\r\nwith gold; they form part of the insignia of the Court. The skin is\r\ngenerally dark-coloured, and rough, having a few scattered hairs upon\r\nit; proofs, however, have been found, that a race of elephants thickly\r\ncovered with hair, once existed. White elephants are occasionally met\r\nwith, and it has been asserted, that they are worshiped. Others have\r\ncontradicted this, and declare, that they are only kept as a piece of\r\nroyal state.\r\n\r\nThe usual height of elephants is from nine to ten feet; but many have\r\nbeen known to attain fourteen; the skeleton of that sent to the Czar\r\nPeter, by the king of Persia, and which is seen in the museum at St.\r\nPetersburgh, is sixteen and a half, and there are records of elephants\r\nattaining the enormous height of twenty feet. When we think of the\r\nmountainous animal, as I have described the elephant to be, it seems\r\ninconsistent to say, that he is swift in his paces: in truth, he is not;\r\na heavy trot being the fastest movement which he can accomplish. His\r\nenormous stride, however, gives him the advantage over lighter animals;\r\nand we have heard of a fast-galloping horse finding it difficult to\r\nescape from an elephant, even when urged to his utmost speed. The gait\r\nis most fatiguing and uncomfortable to those who ride him for the first\r\nfew times, because he moves the two feet on the same side at once; and\r\nthe larger the elephant, the more uncomfortable the movement. Bishop\r\nHeber, however, seems to have formed an exception in this respect, for\r\nhe says, it was far from being disagreeable, and appeared to him to\r\nresemble being carried on men's shoulders. It is supposed that the neck,\r\nwhere the driver places himself, is the easiest seat. He guides the\r\nanimals by occasionally touching their ears, pressing his legs to the\r\nsides of their necks, pricking them with a pointed instrument, or\r\nknocking them with the handle; often, however, they are so docile, that\r\na mere word will be sufficient.\r\n\r\nThe favourite habitation of the elephant is the forest, or green plain,\r\nnear which is a river, or lake: water he must have, for both in freedom\r\nand captivity, bathing seems to be a necessary condition of his\r\nexistence. This propensity reminds me of the often-repeated trick of the\r\nbefore-mentioned elephant of the Jardin des Plantes. His stable opened\r\ninto a small enclosure, in the midst of which was a pond. In this pond\r\nhe constantly laid himself, and was so hidden by the water, that\r\nnothing of him appeared, except the end of his proboscis, which it\r\nrequired an experienced eye to detect. The crowd often assembled round\r\nthe enclosure of the \"elephant's park,\" as it was called, supposing they\r\nshould see him issue from his stable. All at once, however, a copious\r\nshower would assail them, and ladies with their transparent bonnets, and\r\ngentlemen with their shining hats, were forced to seek shelter under the\r\nneighbouring trees, where they looked up at the cloudless sky, and\r\nwondered from whence the shower could come. When they directed their\r\neyes towards the elephant's pond, they saw him standing in the midst,\r\nevincing an awkward joy at the trick he had played. In process of time\r\nhis pastime became generally known, and the moment the water rose from\r\nhis trunk, his beholders ran away, which he also seemed to enjoy\r\nexceedingly, getting up as fast as he could to behold the bustle he had\r\ncreated. This same elephant had been landed from the vessel, which\r\nbrought him from the East Indies, at Bordeaux, and the sailor lad, who\r\nhad taken charge of him during the voyage, was appointed to conduct him\r\nthrough France to Paris. The rough, and sometimes paved roads, cut the\r\npoor animal's feet, and a shoemaker was employed to make him four boots.\r\nThere was not much skill required, as no shape was necessary; but they\r\nanswered the purpose, and were afterwards hung up in his stable to the\r\ngreat delight of the younger visitants to the Jardin, who often went\r\nexpressly to see the elephant's boots. When he and his guide stopped for\r\nthe night, a mattress used to be thrown down on the floor for the\r\nlatter; but, after a few nights, the elephant discovered how comfortable\r\nit was, and under pretense of sharing the accommodation, at length\r\nnightly pushed Auguste off, and stretched his own huge carcass upon the\r\nmattress.\r\n\r\nConstant differences between the Asiatic and African elephants have\r\nestablished them into separate species. The enamel of the grinders is so\r\nplaced in the latter, as to form lozenges; and in the former,\r\nparallel-fluted ribbons. The ears of the African animal are much larger,\r\nand the shape of his forehead is more convex. Although it was from this\r\ncountry that the Romans obtained all their clever, well-trained\r\nelephants, the natives now never think of making them useful. Connected\r\nwith this, I was once much amused by the proposal, seriously suggested,\r\nthat if we English would go among the savage tribes of Africa, and tame\r\nsome of their elephants, they would be so convinced of our superiority,\r\nthat they would, without hesitation, submit to our dominion. This came\r\nfrom a learned king's counsel, and was seriously uttered to one of his\r\nMajesty's government, without exciting surprise in any but my\r\nexperienced self. In our human impatience we are apt to think the\r\nprogress we so much desire, comes slowly; but _could_ such an idea be\r\n_now_ entertained?\r\n\r\nA curious propensity in the Indian elephant has been repeatedly noticed.\r\nI mean the separation of a male elephant from all his companions, in\r\norder to lead a solitary existence. I am rather of opinion with some of\r\nthe natives, that he has been turned away by them for his own misdeeds;\r\nbut I know not if this will equally apply to the raccoon, the only other\r\nanimal, I believe, concerning whom the same habit is recorded. At all\r\nevents, the hermit elephant is particularly fierce and mischievous; and\r\nit becomes a matter of policy, or even necessity, to catch him. The\r\nIndians hunt him down, accompanied by two trained female elephants, who\r\ndraw near to him as if unconscious of his presence, and begin to eat the\r\nsurrounding food as a matter of course. If he join them, they lavish\r\ntheir caresses upon him, and while he is returning their blandishments,\r\nthe hunters creep softly to his feet, and having tied them together,\r\nfasten him to a tree, or let him go loose, with merely the shackles\r\nround all his legs. Of course he is in a dreadful rage, especially when\r\nthe females desert him; but hunger, thirst, and ineffectual struggles,\r\nat last subdue him; he is led away, and generally trained; but if his\r\nviolent efforts should effect his liberation, he plunges into the\r\nforests, whither the hunters prudently do not again go to effect his\r\ncapture. Some female elephants are also used to decoy wild males into\r\ninclosure's, where they are secured; and there is a wholesale method of\r\nsurrounding a herd by a number of men, who, by means of various noises,\r\nmusketry, fire-works, drums and trumpets, drive the elephants into pens\r\nconstructed for the purpose, and supplied with water; where the poor\r\ncreatures are made to stay some time. The elephants become very furious;\r\nand as the strongest inclosure's might give way to their overpowering\r\nstrength, sentinels are placed all round, who light fires and make all\r\nthe noises which the prisoners most dread, till they again become quiet.\r\n\r\nElephants, after being domesticated for years, will return to the\r\nforests, and resume their wild habits; but they never forget their\r\neducation. Their former keepers have recognized them among their untamed\r\ncompanions, called them, and without hesitation, they have walked from\r\nthe midst of their brethren, and quietly returned to their former\r\nhabits, after a lapse of ten years. All are extremely sensible to the\r\npraises and caresses of those who attend to them, for whose sake they\r\nwill make the most wonderful exertions. They are useful in transporting\r\nartillery and heavy baggage, and their docility and obedient performance\r\nof their duties, even when left to themselves, is perfect. They are not\r\nnow used in war, except by some of the native princes; but they largely\r\nenter into the state processions, decked out with the most costly\r\ntrappings of gold and silver, frontlets of jewels, gold and silver\r\nchains, and bells, etc. Travellers generally place a kind of canopy on\r\ntheir backs, in which two or three persons can sit; but the saddle is\r\nmost used when hunting tigers. They dexterously catch these animals upon\r\ntheir tusks, if the attack be made in front, but the tiger will\r\nsometimes seize them in the flank, when if they cannot roll upon him,\r\nthe elephants rush forward, and the tiger is generally shot. The\r\nassertion that the elephant and rhinoceros will fight a duel for the\r\npleasure of the thing, does not seem to be borne out by experience; but\r\ncombats have been seen between them, in which sometimes one, and\r\nsometimes the other, have gained the victory.\r\n\r\nThe quantity of food daily consumed by an elephant in captivity is\r\ncalculated at 200 lbs; besides thirty-six pails of water. It consists of\r\nturnips, rice, chaff, bran, hay, and sea biscuit. Straw is allowed for\r\nhis bed, which is generally consumed before morning; besides which, when\r\nthey are in menageries they receive no small quantity of dainties from\r\nvisitors. I never could enter the Rotunda in the Paris menagerie,\r\nwithout being furnished with bread or carrots for its inhabitants: the\r\ninstant the Indian elephant caught sight of me, he used to sit down, get\r\nup again, make what was called a curtsy, and play other antics; and the\r\ninstant I came before him, squat down again; his trunk raised, and his\r\nenormous mouth wide open to receive what I threw into it; the attitude\r\nwas so grotesque and imploring, that it was impossible to deny him. In\r\ntheir native condition, elephants eat the young juicy roots, and\r\nbranches of trees; the latter of which, they beat two or three times\r\nbefore they take them, and they then tuck them into the left side of\r\ntheir mouths; they also devour grass, and bulbous roots, which they pull\r\nup with their proboscis. The vast numbers in which the herds assemble,\r\ngive some idea of the extent of the vegetable riches which can support\r\nsuch colossal eaters from generation to generation; the weight of an\r\nordinary one will be 7000 lbs, and the mind becomes bewildered, in\r\nthinking of the quantity required for the daily sustenance of thousands\r\nof such animals. They open paths through forests which would be\r\nimpenetrable to others; and seem to exercise much judgment in choosing\r\ntheir route, the large bull elephants taking the lead, crushing the\r\njungle, tearing down the branches, and uprooting the trees; the females\r\nand the young sometimes amounting to three hundred, march after in\r\nsingle file, and the way thus made is as smooth as a gravel walk. They\r\noften carry branches of trees, with which they flap the insects from\r\ntheir bodies as they walk along.\r\n\r\nA settler's wife complained to Mr. Pringle very bitterly, of the\r\ndestruction occasioned to her husband's crops by the elephants; which\r\nshe, with reason, said were too big to wrestle with, and they\r\noccasionally seemed to commit mischief from mere wantonness. In the same\r\nplace, a troop came down one dark and rainy night to the outskirts of\r\nthe village; but knowing that it was sometimes dangerous to encounter\r\nthem, the inhabitants did not go out; although they heard them making a\r\nterrible bellowing and uproar. It appeared the next morning, that one of\r\nthe elephants had fallen into an unfinished trench, which had no water\r\nin it, and did not know how to get out again. It is supposed, that his\r\ncompanions had pulled him out with their trunks; for there were clearly\r\ndefined marks of their having stationed themselves on each side; some\r\nkneeling, and some standing, and that thus he had been hoisted up.\r\n\r\nThe remarkable escape of Lieut. Moodie is one of the most extraordinary\r\nencounters on record. A servant informed him that a large troop of\r\nelephants was in the vicinity, and that a party had gone out to attack\r\nthem, so he started to join in the hunt; but losing his way in the\r\njungle, he did not overtake them till they had driven the elephants from\r\ntheir first station. On leaving the jungle, he was going through a\r\nmeadow on the banks of the Gualana, to the spot where the firing had\r\nbegun, when he was suddenly warned of some danger, by the cry of \"Take\r\ncare\" both in Dutch and English. He heard a crackling behind him,\r\noccasioned by the elephants breaking through the wood, which was\r\naccompanied by their screams. A large female elephant, and three of a\r\nsmaller size, departed from the rest, and came towards him; but not\r\nbeing in a good position for firing, Mr. Moodie retreated from their\r\ndirect path, to get a better place from which to take aim, and hoped\r\nthey would not observe him. They, however, rapidly pursued him; he\r\nreserved his fire as a last resource, and turning off at a right angle,\r\nmade for the banks of the river, intending to take refuge among the\r\nrocks on the other side. Before this, however, they were close upon him,\r\nscreaming so tremendously that he was almost stunned by their noise. He\r\nturned upon them, and fired at the head of the largest; the powder had\r\nbecome damp, the gun hung fire, till he was in the act of taking it from\r\nhis shoulder, when it went off, and the ball grazed the side of the\r\nlarge elephant's head. She stopped for an instant, and then rushed\r\nfuriously forward: whether struck down or not, he could never say; but\r\nLieut. Moodie fell. The animal had only one tusk, which missed him as\r\nshe rushed upon him; but it ploughed up the earth within an inch or two\r\nof his body; she then caught him by the middle with her trunk, threw\r\nhim between her fore feet, and battered him with them for a short time;\r\none of these huge feet once pressed him so much, that his bones bent\r\nunder its weight. He did not lose his recollection, and he constantly\r\nwas able to twitch himself on one side, and so avoid several blows. Two\r\nof his party came up and fired at her; one bullet alone touching her in\r\nthe shoulder; her young ones then retreated, and she left her victim,\r\nfinally knocking him with her hind feet as she went off. He got up,\r\npicked up his gun, and staggered away as fast as he could. She turned\r\nround, looked after him; and he then lay down in the long grass, and so\r\neluded her observation.\r\n\r\nA soldier of the Royal African Corps did not escape as Mr. Moodie did,\r\nfor an elephant caught him with his trunk, carried him some distance,\r\nthrew him down, brought his four feet together and trod and stamped upon\r\nhim till he was dead. He left the body, then returned to it, knelt down\r\nupon, crushed and kneaded it once more; then he seized it with his\r\ntrunk, bore it to the jungle, and threw it among the bushes.\r\n\r\nOne of the strongest instincts of the elephant is to try the strength of\r\neverything before he ventures upon it, and it is almost impossible to\r\ninduce him to trust himself upon any surface which is not perfectly firm\r\nand steady. Therefore the well-authenticated story is the more\r\nextraordinary of a rope-dancing, or rather walking elephant, who not\r\nonly walked forwards, but backwards upon a suspended rope.\r\n\r\nA female elephant, seven years old, on being brought to the Adelphi,\r\nfirst ascertained the safety of the stage, and then began to rehearse\r\nthe parts she used to play in Paris. Having succeeded so well in this\r\nplace, she took a higher walk of performances at the Coburg theatre,\r\nwhere she rehearsed for three weeks, then distinguished the actors,\r\nlearnt to place the crown on the head of the lawful king, and feasted at\r\nhis banquet with perfect propriety. All this was taught her by kindness.\r\n\r\nA poor little calf elephant hovered about the body of its mother after\r\nshe had been killed, making the most mournful noises; the herd had\r\ndeserted them, and they had passed the night in the forest. The poor\r\nthing, when the hunters came up, entwined its little proboscis about\r\ntheir legs, showed its delight at their approach by many ungainly\r\nantics, then went to the body of its mother, scaring away the vultures;\r\nran round it with every mark of grief, and tried to raise it with its\r\ntrunk. Of course the confidence of the baby elephant was not abused,\r\nthough its wishes for aid towards its mother, could not be gratified.\r\n\r\nThe elephants of Ceylon have always been reckoned the best; and\r\ninstances of their memory are quite extraordinary. A favourite mode of\r\nexecution among the Canadians, when they were masters of the island, was\r\nto make the elephants trample upon the criminals, so as to crush their\r\nlimbs first, and by avoiding the vital parts prolong their agony. When\r\nMr. Sirr was there, he saw one of these elephant executioners. The word\r\nof command, \"Slay the wretch!\" was given to him; upon which he raised\r\nhis trunk, pretended to twist it round a body, then slowly raised one of\r\nhis fore feet, and placed it where the limbs of the victim would have\r\nbeen; then he stood motionless with his trunk in the air. He was ordered\r\nto complete his work, and he placed one foot as if on the man's abdomen,\r\nand another as if on his head, with apparently sufficient force to\r\ndestroy life. The elephant had not done this for thirty-five years, and\r\nyet recollected the whole. They attain a great age, and have been known\r\nto live more than a hundred years.\r\n\r\nMajor Rogers, who had killed one thousand four hundred elephants, shot\r\none on whom the ball only made a flesh wound; the creature, in a fury,\r\nuttered its trumpet-like shriek, seized the Major with his trunk,\r\ncarried him to a deep hole, dashed him into it, and trampled upon him,\r\nbreaking his right arm in two places, and several of his ribs. He must\r\nhave been killed if the hole had been large enough to give the elephant\r\nroom to exercise his whole strength. He became senseless; but when he\r\ncame to himself, found the elephant gone, and friends about him: he knew\r\nwhat had happened, and said he had always made up his mind, in case of\r\nsuch an accident, to remain quite passive, as affording the best chance\r\nof escape--and his plan answered.\r\n\r\nNothing done to elephants by way of insult, teasing, or unkindness, is\r\never forgotten or forgiven by them, and they are sure to take an\r\nopportunity of revenging themselves. On the other hand, kindness is\r\nequally remembered and appreciated; an awkward proof of which occurred\r\nto a lady, who, when she frequently went to see a male elephant, carried\r\nto him bread, apples, and brandy. To show his gratitude for these, he\r\ntook her up with his trunk one day, and seated her on his back. As she\r\ncould not enjoy this testimonial of his feelings, she uttered the most\r\npiercing shrieks, and implored the assistance of those around. His\r\nkeepers, however, advised her not to stir, and there she was obliged to\r\nwait till he again encircled her with his trunk, and put her on the\r\nground in safety. Of the attachment of elephants to each other, a proof\r\nwas given by two in the Jardin des Plantes, who had been with difficulty\r\nseparated during their journey thither from Holland. They were placed in\r\ntwo apartments, divided by a portcullis. The male soon found out that\r\nthis was fastened only by a perpendicular bolt, which he soon raised,\r\nand then rushed into the other room. The joy of the two at meeting can\r\nscarcely be described: their cries of joy shook the whole building, and\r\nthey blew air from their trunks resembling the blasts from smiths'\r\nbellows. The female moved her ears with great rapidity, and entwined her\r\ntrunk round the body of the male; she kept the end motionless for a long\r\ntime close to his ear, and after holding it again round his body,\r\napplied it to her own mouth. The male encircled her with his trunk, and\r\nshed tears. They were afterwards kept in the same apartment; and their\r\nattachment was never interrupted.\r\n\r\nThe indignation of elephants at being laughed at or deceived, has been\r\nmanifested very often; and sometimes they punish the offenders with\r\ndeath; at others, they seem perfectly to understand in what way their\r\nretaliation will take most effect, without inflicting so serious a\r\nreproof.\r\n\r\nAn artist in Paris was anxious to draw one of the elephants of the\r\nmenagerie there; with his trunk in the air, and his mouth wide open.\r\nAfter throwing fruit and vegetables in for some time, to make him repeat\r\nthe attitude, his keeper only pretended to do so, fearing to give him\r\ntoo much food. The elephant at last became irritated, and perfectly\r\nunderstood that the artist was the cause of his annoyance; he,\r\ntherefore, turned round upon him, and dashed a quantity of water over\r\nthe paper on which he was drawing. It is chiefly in animals of greatest\r\nintelligence that we find the greatest affection and gratitude;\r\nelephants have sometimes refused to eat, and have pined to death when\r\nseparated from their favourite keepers, and they are never obliterated\r\nfrom their memory. Their humanity is also frequently conspicuous; and we\r\nare told of one who, on being ordered to walk over the bodies of some\r\nsick persons, at first refused to advance; and then on being goaded by\r\nhis driver, gently took the poor men up with his trunk, and laid them on\r\none side, so that he could not do them any injury.\r\n\r\nThe following is another fearful instance of their power and vengeance,\r\nrelated by Mr. Burchell, a South African traveller. \"Carl Krieger was a\r\nfearless hunter, and being an excellent marksman, often ventured into\r\nthe most dangerous situations. One day, having with his party pursued an\r\nelephant which he had wounded, the irritated animal suddenly turned\r\nround, and singling out from the rest the person by whom he had been\r\ninjured, seized him with his trunk, and lifting his wretched victim high\r\nin the air, dashed him with dreadful force to the ground. His\r\ncompanions, struck with horror, fled precipitately from the fatal scene,\r\nunable to look back upon the rest of the dreadful tragedy; but on the\r\nfollowing day, they repaired to the spot, where they collected the few\r\nbones that could be found, and buried them. The enraged animal had not\r\nonly literally trampled Krieger's body to pieces, but did not feel its\r\nvengeance satisfied till it had pounded the very flesh and bones into\r\nthe dust, so that nothing of the unfortunate man remained excepting a\r\nfew of the latter, which made most resistance from their size.\"\r\n\r\nM. Frederic Cuvier, in his admirable essay on the \"Domestication of\r\nAnimals,\" writes as follows, concerning an elephant in the menagerie of\r\nthe Jardin des Plantes. The care of this animal had been confided, when\r\nhe was only three or four years old, to a young person, who taught him a\r\nnumber of those tricks which amuse the public. The animal loved him so\r\nmuch, as not only to be perfectly obedient to all his commands, but to\r\nbe unhappy out of his presence. He rejected the kindness of every one\r\nelse, and even was with difficulty persuaded to eat the food presented\r\nto him.\r\n\r\nDuring a certain period, the elephant had remained with his owner, and\r\nthe young man, his son, had constantly evinced the greatest kindness\r\ntowards the animal; but he was at length sold to the government, and his\r\nkeeper hired to take care of him; deprived of all restraint, and his\r\nfamily no longer present to watch over him, the latter neglected his\r\ncharge, and when intoxicated, even struck his favourite, for he\r\nabandoned himself to the worst habits. The naturally cheerful\r\ndisposition of the elephant began to alter, and he was thought to be\r\nill; he was still obedient, but his exercises no longer gave him\r\npleasure. He now and then appeared to be impatient, but tried to repress\r\nhis feelings; the struggle, however, changed him so much, that his\r\nkeeper became still more dissatisfied with him. Orders had been given to\r\nthe young man never to beat the elephant, but in vain. Mortified at\r\nlosing his influence, which daily became less, his own irritability\r\nincreased; and one day being more unreasonable than ever, he struck the\r\nelephant with such brutality, that the beast uttered a furious cry. The\r\nfrightened keeper fled, and it was well he did so, for from that moment\r\nthe elephant could not endure the sight of him, becoming violent the\r\nmoment he appeared; and nothing ever restored the poor animal to his\r\nprevious good conduct: hatred had succeeded to love, indocility to\r\nobedience, and as long as the animal lived these two latter feelings\r\npredominated.\r\n\r\nMr. Broderip, in his delightful Zoological Recreations, tells us of an\r\nelephant which was shewn, among other wild beasts, at a fair in the West\r\nof England. One of the spectators gratified the elephant by some\r\nexcellent gingerbread nuts, in return for which, the animal,\r\nunsolicited, performed his tricks. The donor, however, was a practical\r\njoker, and when he had gained the confidence of the good-tempered beast,\r\npresented him with a large parcel, weighing two or three pounds, which\r\nthe elephant took unsuspectingly, all at once. He had scarcely\r\nswallowed it, however, than he set up a loud roar, and seemed to suffer\r\nexceedingly; he gave the bucket to his keeper, as if to ask for water,\r\nwhich was supplied to him most plentifully. \"Ho!\" said his tormentor,\r\n\"Those nuts were a trifle hot, old fellow, I guess.\" \"You had better be\r\noff,\" exclaimed the keeper, \"unless you want the bucket at your head;\r\nand serve you right, too.\" The elephant drank the sixth bucket full, and\r\nthen hurled the empty vessel at the head of the man, just as he cleared\r\nthe entrance of the show, or most probably he would have lost his life.\r\nA year after, at the same place, the joker again went to see the\r\nelephant, with one pocket full of good nuts, and the other with nuts of\r\npepper. He gave the animal some of the first, and then presented him\r\nwith one that was hot. The moment the elephant tasted it, he seized the\r\ncoat tails of the man, and lifted him from the ground, when the cloth\r\ngiving way, he dropped down, half dead with fright; and his coat reduced\r\nto a jacket. The elephant retained the skirts, inserted his trunk into\r\nthe pockets, and devoured the good nuts in the most leisurely manner,\r\nafter due examination. Those done, he trampled upon the others, till he\r\nhad reduced them to a mash, then tore the coat skirts to rags, and threw\r\nthem to their owner.\r\n\r\nWe must not omit to mention the remarkable partiality of the elephant\r\nfor brandy, rum, or arrack, either of which will tempt him to make\r\nextraordinary exertions, and which seems almost unnatural in so simple a\r\nfeeder.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHIPPOPOTAMUS.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen all London, and half England, have been to see the Hippopotamus, at\r\nthe Zoological Gardens, I feel as if a work on animals, written at the\r\npresent moment, would be incomplete unless it contained some notice of\r\nthis animal. Nevertheless, in spite of research into old and new books,\r\ninto private reminiscences, and personal recollections, I find it\r\ndifficult to raise him to the intellectual place of those which have\r\nbeen, or will be treated of in my pages. When I heard praises so\r\nlavishly bestowed upon him, when I became even reproached for not having\r\nbeen to see him, I began to think I had been mistaken, and that my\r\nformer acquaintance with his brethren must have been made under\r\ncircumstances which had caused prejudice; I therefore paid him a visit,\r\nspent some little time in watching and observing him, and came away,\r\nmore than ever astonished at the marvellous effects which novelty and\r\nvariety will produce in the minds of men; throwing beauty and interest\r\nover the most ungainly form and good-natured stupidity. He certainly\r\nlooks to greater advantage in this country than he does in his own; for\r\nhere a rose-coloured blush tinges his skin, and there he is too often\r\ncovered with mud, to wear any other appearance than that of a dirty\r\nbrown.\r\n\r\nThe hippopotamus is exclusively a denizen of Africa; and perfectly\r\nharmless when unprovoked; except that he sometimes gets into the\r\nplantations in the vicinity of his haunts, and crushes and devours a\r\ncrop of maize, or millet. He would rather avoid fighting or quarreling;\r\nbut, like all other brute creatures, can retaliate an injury with a\r\nfury, which is rendered frightful by his enormous weight. He looks best\r\nwhen walking in the shallow part of a lake or river, just under the\r\nwater, with his eyes open; but if there should be a boat, or canoe on\r\nthe surface, the sooner it bears its freight to the shore the better;\r\nfor he is sure at least to try and upset it with his huge back; not that\r\nhe has any murderous intentions, but he probably thinks it is an\r\nintrusion on his peculiar domains.\r\n\r\nThe hide of the hippopotamus, of which tremendous whips are made, is at\r\nleast two inches thick, and has no hair upon it; his legs are so short,\r\nthat the body of one that is full grown, almost reaches the ground, and\r\nsometimes measures five feet across; his tail is very short and\r\ninsignificant, and his eyes and ears are very small. They live together\r\nin small numbers, feed chiefly on grass and aquatic plants, and come\r\nforth at night. Each foot has four toes, and each toe a separate hoof;\r\nthe nostrils open on the top of the muzzle; their flesh is thought to be\r\nvery good to eat, and to resemble pork. A thick layer of fat lies just\r\nunder the skin, which the Africans look upon as a great delicacy for the\r\ntable. The male is the largest; and two species are said to exist. The\r\nexploits of Mr. Gordon Cumming give us a lively picture of their habits;\r\nbut there is nothing in his work which affords the slightest interest in\r\ntheir mental faculties. The following account from the pen of Captain\r\nOwen who explored so large a portion of the African shores, is the only\r\ninstance I have met with which wears the semblance of almost unprovoked\r\nanger on the part of a hippopotamus:--\"While examining a branch of the\r\nTemby river, in Delagoa Bay, a violent shock was suddenly felt from\r\nunderneath the boat, and in another moment, a monstrous hippopotamus\r\nreared itself up from the water, and in a most ferocious and menacing\r\nattitude rushed open-mouthed at the boat; with one grasp of its\r\ntremendous jaws it seized and tore seven planks from her side; the\r\ncreature disappeared for a few seconds, and then rose again, apparently\r\nintending to repeat the attack, but was fortunately deterred by the\r\ncontents of a musket discharged in its face. The boat rapidly filled;\r\nbut, as she was not more than an oar's length from the shore, they (the\r\ncrew) succeeded in reaching it before she sank. The keel, in all\r\nprobability, had touched the back of the animal, which, irritating him,\r\noccasioned this furious attack; and had he got his upper jaw above the\r\ngunwale, the whole broadside must have been torn out. The force of the\r\nshock from beneath, previously to the attack, was so violent, that her\r\nstern was almost lifted out of the water, and Mr. Tambs, the midshipman\r\nsteering, was thrown overboard, but fortunately rescued before the\r\nirritated animal could seize him.\"\r\n\r\nThe hippopotamus, with his shy and secluded habits, may be easily passed\r\nas he lies concealed among the reeds which grow by the side of the\r\nriver, but if once he gets into the water, he is always to be detected\r\nby the blowing noise which he makes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHOGS.\r\n\r\n\r\nNature has so strongly marked the wild and the tame Hog with the same\r\ncharacters, that no hesitation arises in pronouncing the former to be\r\nthe stock from whence we have derived the latter. In common, however,\r\nwith all other free and domesticated animals, there is a prolongation of\r\nmuzzle in the wild species, which is not to be found in those of our\r\nsties. The tusks also are larger; in this instance, as in all others,\r\nshowing how bountifully the Great Creator provides for all. The domestic\r\nhog is not required to seek his food and dig roots as his untamed\r\nbrother does, and, therefore, the parts most used for these purposes are\r\nnot equally developed. Both, however, possess very powerful muscles of\r\nthe neck and shoulder, to give movement to their large and strong jaws.\r\nThey all have four toes on each foot; the two in the middle being much\r\nthe largest and armed with strong hoofs. Their snout looks as if it had\r\nbeen suddenly chopped off, as if to expose the nostrils, which are\r\npierced in this truncated portion. Their triangular, canine teeth, or\r\ntusks, project beyond the mouth; those of both jaws curve upwards. They\r\nmake very formidable weapons, as many a dog and huntsman has known to\r\nhis cost. Wild hogs are covered with stiff, dark brown hair, which gets\r\ngrizzly with age, and is more upright along the back. The tail is short;\r\nand in many varieties of the domestic pig, it curls very tightly.\r\n\r\nThe male wild boar only associates with the female for a short period,\r\nand at other times lives alone, in the thickest parts of dense forests;\r\ncoming forth in the evening to procure his food, which is chiefly of a\r\nvegetable nature. It is only when pressed by hunger, that wild hogs will\r\neat animal substances. The females herd together, and their young\r\nremain with them till they are two or three years old. When they are\r\nabout to be born, the mothers retreat as far as possible from the\r\nfathers, as the latter have a most longing desire always to devour their\r\noffspring. The females, left to defend themselves and their children,\r\nplace the latter behind them, and expose themselves in a line to the\r\nattacks of an enemy, or they form a circle round them, and evince an\r\nextraordinary amount of fury and courage. Sparrman, the South African\r\ntraveller asserts, that the species of wild sow in those regions, when\r\nso closely pursued that it is impossible for them to make off, take the\r\nyoung pigs in their mouths. To his astonishment, one day, when pursuing\r\na herd, all the young ones disappeared, nor could he explain the mystery\r\ntill aware of this singular fact.\r\n\r\nThe hunting of wild boars has, from the most ancient times, been\r\nreckoned a noble sport; for it not only called for dexterity and\r\ncourage, but was attended with considerable danger, from the extreme\r\nsavageness of these animals when at bay, and the facility with which\r\nthey rip open their antagonists with their tusks. They were in former\r\ntimes considered as royal game, and fines were imposed on those who\r\nkilled them without having the privilege of doing so. The time of their\r\nextirpation in England is uncertain; but we know that in the reign of\r\nCharles the First, orders were given for some domestic hogs to be turned\r\ninto the New Forest, that they might become wild; but they were all\r\ndestroyed in the time of Cromwell. Some still exist in the large\r\nEuropean forests, and a variety of hounds are still trained to hunt\r\nthem. Horses are particularly alarmed at them, and in the history of\r\nboar-hunts, we constantly read of the sportsmen being forced to alight\r\nfrom their steeds to take a steady aim. The numbers of ancient arms in\r\nwhich they are found, and the names of old places derived from them,\r\nattest their numerous presence here; for instance, Brandon, which is\r\n_brawn's den_; brawn being the old term for boar. Their skin is so thick\r\nas frequently to deaden the force of bullets, which, after death, have\r\nbeen found lying between it and the flesh.\r\n\r\nThe wild boars of Africa have a broader snout than their European\r\nbrethren, and possess two protuberances under the eyes, which prevent\r\nthem from seeing anything underneath them. They live in subterranean\r\nholes; and one which had been for some time kept in confinement, was\r\naccidentally left loose in a small court near his cage, upon which he\r\ntore up the pavement, and had already made a deep pit when his keeper\r\nreturned. When the natives of Africa spear or entrap one, they tie his\r\nfore-feet together, sling him on a pole, decorate him and themselves\r\nwith creeping plants, and return to their huts with triumphant shouts\r\nand rejoicing. The flesh of these is very close-grained, white and\r\nhard. The impossibility of keeping meat in that country till it becomes\r\ntender, makes wild boar flesh almost useless to Europeans, unless their\r\nteeth vie with those of negroes.\r\n\r\nSome idea of the sort of sport which attends the chase of wild boars,\r\nmay be formed from the following account of one which took place in a\r\nforest in Luxembourg. At a battle, several of these animals were driven\r\ntogether, and they came rushing on like a squadron of heavy dragoons,\r\nbreaking through the underwood. Several shots were fired, and they tried\r\nto disperse. One huntsman got out of the line, and a boar came rushing\r\nupon him; but a fresh shot broke one of his legs; which, however, though\r\nit made him more savage, caused him to turn into the forest. The\r\nwell-trained dogs, and the huntsmen pursued him; and when they came up\r\nwith him, found him terrifically savage. One of the hounds, more daring\r\nthan the rest, made a dart at the beast, seized him by one ear, and\r\nbounded over him to the opposite side. They ran off together, the boar's\r\nhead almost turned upside down; but, with a sudden jerk, the dog was\r\nshaken off, and the boar tearing him open, tossed him several feet in\r\nthe air. The pack then gathered so thickly round, that the boar's\r\nprogress was stayed; the men then came up and cut his throat. At another\r\npoint of the wood, a sow, weighing three hundred pounds, and followed\r\nby her young, was wounded, and furiously pursued a hunter, whom she\r\nsurprised in a narrow pass between two rocks. He waited her approach and\r\nfired, or rather tried to do so, but his gun missed; he then, in an\r\ninstant, fell on his face and hands, and the sow ran over his body.\r\nRising, and loading his gun, he provoked the sow again by his cries. The\r\nfoaming creature, with flashing eyes, turned upon him; but this time she\r\nreceived the charge in her head and fell.\r\n\r\nWild hogs are easily domesticated, and as easily resume their\r\nuncivilized habits; but they seem then to keep in packs. Mr. Byam\r\nrelates the following adventure with these renegades:--\"I was one day\r\nhunting alone, on foot, in a rather open wood, when a large boar made\r\nhis appearance about sixty yards off, and not seeing any of his\r\ncompanions, I let fly the ball, and tumbled him over. He gave a fierce\r\ngrunt or two as he lay; and a large herd of boars and sows rushed out of\r\nsome thick underwood behind him, and, after looking at the fallen beast\r\nfor a few seconds, made a dash at me: but they were a trifle too late,\r\nfor on catching sight of them, I ran to a tree, 'cut up' it for life,\r\nand had only just scrambled into some diverging branches, about ten feet\r\nfrom the ground, when the whole herd arrived; grunting and squeaking, at\r\nthe foot of the tree. I could not help laughing at the ridiculous figure\r\nI must have made, chased up a tree by a dozen of pigs; but it soon\r\nturned out no laughing matter, for their patience was not, as I\r\nexpected, soon exhausted; and they settled round the tree about twenty\r\nyards distant, and kept looking at me with their little twinkling eyes,\r\nas much as to say, 'We'll have you yet.'\" So far are Mr. Byam's own\r\nwords; and I now give the sequel in a more abridged form, though, by so\r\ndoing, I feel that I deprive the story of some of its zest:--Having made\r\nup his mind to a regular siege, he examined his resources, and found\r\nthem to be a double-barreled gun, a flask of powder (nearly full),\r\nplenty of copper caps; a few charges of shot; only two balls; a knife,\r\nflint, and steel; a piece of hard, dried tongue; a small flask of\r\nspirits and water; and a good bundle of cigars. He could not expect\r\nrelief, a sally was out of the question; so he made himself as\r\ncomfortable as he could. Hour after hour passed, the pigs never stirred,\r\nexcept when one or two returned to look at their dead comrade, as if to\r\nsharpen their revenge. At length the imprisoned hunter thought of firing\r\noff some powder every few minutes, shouting at the same time. One barrel\r\nof his gun was still loaded with shot, and he aimed at an old boar; who,\r\non returning from his deceased friend, had looked up at him and grunted.\r\nThe whole charge, at a distance of about twenty feet, went into the\r\nboar's face, who then turned round and ran away, making a horrible\r\nnoise. The rest of the party charged altogether up to the foot of the\r\ntree, but the outcry of the old boar drew them away; and the whole herd\r\nwent after him, making such a noise as never before had saluted Mr.\r\nByam's ears. He remained in the tree a short time; and, when all was\r\nquiet, he slipped down, and ran away as fast as he could, in a contrary\r\ndirection.\r\n\r\nHogs are not equally prized by all nations. The detestation in which\r\nthey were held by the Egyptians, was continued by the Israelites; not\r\nonly from living with those people, but because they were unclean\r\nanimals. They are still viewed in that light by Brahmins and Mussulmans,\r\nwho only rear them to sell to Christians, or to make scavengers of them,\r\nfor, in a domestic state, they are omnivorous. The dislike of the latter\r\nto them was once very serviceable to me; for when we were bivouacking\r\nclose to a Mahommedan village, the people, and the priests thronged\r\naround us, so as to be extremely troublesome; and the only way in which\r\nwe could keep them at a distance, without force, was by tying pieces of\r\nham over the different entrances of the building in which we were.\r\n\r\nSomewhat like rats, there seems to be a mysterious distribution of swine\r\nall over the face of the earth; and much astonishment was created in the\r\nminds of the discoverers of the South Sea Islands, by finding them in\r\nthose far-off specks of the earth. Perhaps there had been earlier\r\nnavigators there than ourselves.\r\n\r\nPork, fresh or cured, forms the principal food of our sailors and\r\npeasantry; and most precious is the pig to the poor man. It is often the\r\npet of the younger branches of his family, and returns their affection\r\nwith interest.\r\n\r\nOf course, it is an idle fable that pigs can see and smell the wind; but\r\nit is perfectly true that they are always much agitated when a storm is\r\napproaching.\r\n\r\nConsidering the stupid way in which they run when they are frightened,\r\nthe manner in which they squeak on all occasions, and the obstinacy\r\nwhich they evince, very often when an endeavour is made to add to their\r\nrelief or comfort, it is not surprising that a low estimate of their\r\nintelligence should hare been formed. Nevertheless, they have been\r\ntrained to point out letters and spell words, till they have acquired\r\nthe appellation of \"learned pigs.\" What, however, is more useful, they\r\ndraw the plough in the south of France--they are taught to hunt the\r\ntruffles, which are hidden under the soil--they even stand at game like\r\nthe most accomplished pointers. The latter instruction was conveyed by\r\nmeans of stones and pudding; if they failed in their duty, they received\r\nthe former; but when they drooped their ears and tail, and sank upon\r\ntheir knees, nor rose till the birds had already risen, they feasted on\r\n\"lumps o' pudding.\"\r\n\r\nOf the voracity of pigs, there are many stories, all more or less\r\ndisagreeable; and none more so than when they have killed and partially\r\neaten children, and utterly devoured their young keepers. Such stories\r\nhave been too well authenticated to be doubted; but they are exceptions\r\nto the general history of the animal. It is much more pleasing to refer\r\nto the life, death, and burial of poor Jean, who was saved out of a\r\nlitter of six (born on board ship) from the butcher's knife. She was\r\nbrought up as a pet, and suffered to run about deck, among sheep and\r\ngoats. Most of the live stock was washed off, but Jean remained because\r\nshe had been stowed away in the long boat. In warm latitudes the men\r\ntook their meals on deck, and she was always one of the mess, poking her\r\nnose into every bread bag, and scalding it in the soup. The sailors\r\npoured grog down her throat, and twice made her tipsy; and she behaved\r\nas most individuals do on such occasions.\r\n\r\nIn consequence of the scarcity of fresh provisions in the Chinese seas,\r\nJean was ordered to be killed, her fry to be eaten one day, her head\r\nmade into turtle soup the next, and after that, her legs, etc., roasted;\r\nbut the ship's company pleaded that she might be spared, stating, among\r\nother reasons, that when called, she came like a dog. \"Jean! Jean!\"\r\nexclaimed the captain, and she bounced along, tripping up the officer of\r\nthe watch.\r\n\r\nLike most pets, Jean became intolerably fat and lazy, in which condition\r\nshe was an object of great attraction to the Chinese; they longed for\r\nher, wanted to buy her, begged for her, and watched for her, knowing she\r\nmust die soon, and then be thrown overboard. Jack, however, had no\r\ninclination to gratify the Chinamen, and when poor Jean breathed her\r\nlast, two masses of ballast iron were placed, one on each cheek, and\r\nlashed to her neck and shoulders in such a manner, that by their\r\nprojection they made a long, sharp snout, which would penetrate into the\r\nmud. She was lowered over the ship's side, head foremost, and when below\r\nthe surface of the water, the rope was cast off, and her well-loaded\r\ncarcase went down too deep, even for the search of the cunning\r\nChinese.[6]\r\n\r\n[6] The source whence I obtained this anecdote has escaped me; but I\r\nthink it is from the pen of Captain Basil Hall.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRHINOCEROSES.\r\n\r\n\r\nWith quite as little personal beauty as the Pachydermata of which I have\r\nhitherto treated, the Rhinoceros takes his place among the powerful of\r\nthe earth. He has no tusks, but bears one or two horns upon his nose. Of\r\nthese, when there are two, the foremost is the largest, all are curved\r\nand polished, and appear to be formed of hairs, aggregated into a solid\r\nmass. The bones of the nose are remarkably thickened and developed into\r\nthat form which is best adapted to resist a shock--namely, the arch; and\r\nby this, not only is the animal able to carry its horn high, but to bear\r\nthe tremendous resistance with which it meets when it uses that horn. In\r\nall but one species the upper lip is prolonged, and capable of such\r\nextension that it becomes prehensile; it protrudes this lip, lowers its\r\nhorn or horns, so as to lean forwards, and rushes at the object of its\r\nanger or dislike with almost inconceivable fury. I have already\r\ncontradicted the assertion, that it seeks the elephant for the purpose\r\nof giving him battle, on which occasion it was said to sharpen its horn\r\nagainst a stone just before the engagement: according to Mr. Gordon\r\nCumming's account, they inhabit the same neighbourhood without\r\nexhibiting any particular enmity towards each other.\r\n\r\nAs far as we know at present, there are six species, all of which\r\ninhabit Africa and India, including Java and Sumatra; they have three\r\ntoes on each foot covered with a hoof. The sides of their body project\r\nin a remarkable degree; their skin is enormously thick, knotty in its\r\nsurface, and has but a few hairs scattered over it. The Indian\r\nrhinoceroses have enormous folds of this skin, hanging upon the\r\nshoulders, haunches, neck and thighs, looking as if each fold covered a\r\nthick rope; the ears of all are erect, the eyes small and near the nose;\r\nthe tail short; they carry their heads so low that they almost touch the\r\nearth; they plough up the ground with their horn, scattering stones and\r\nsoil without any apparent motive, and few things can resist the\r\nimpetuous force which they put forth, when they rush upon an object\r\nwhich has excited their fury. Their smell and hearing are extremely\r\nacute, so that it is difficult to approach them; but as their sight is\r\nvery limited, they may be avoided by slipping on one side when they are\r\nin pursuit of an enemy.\r\n\r\nThe Javanese and Sumatran species are smaller, lighter, and consequently\r\nless ferocious and powerful than the others. Both in Africa and India\r\nthere is a superstition with regard to the horns of all the species,\r\nwhich the natives declare are sensibly acted on by poison. It is the\r\ncustom to make cups of them, and in India it is said, that liquid poison\r\npoured into them, effervesces in such a manner that it overflows the\r\ncup. In Africa, the inhabitants assure you, that the cup will turn black\r\nfrom the same cause; and that water drunk from them possesses medicinal\r\nproperties, especially if stirred with iron. The folds on the skin of\r\nthe African species are much less than those of the Indian, and amount\r\nto scarcely more than wrinkles. The latter have been known to live a\r\nhundred years, and when young, their skin has a pink tinge. All eat the\r\nyoung branches of trees, and shrubs, and grass.\r\n\r\nIt has been observed, that the skin of the African rhinoceros is so full\r\nof insects, that birds are in the habit of perching upon them, for the\r\npurpose of feeding on these insects. They suffer their winged friends to\r\nremain undisturbed, thinking, that as long as they stay, no enemy is\r\nnear; but if they fly off, some danger is approaching, for which they\r\nimmediately look out. These birds are not unlike the missal thrush, and\r\nremain by their friends till they are forced to leave them. When the\r\nlatter are shot, they fly away, uttering a harsh cry, and return to\r\ntheir positions when all is quiet, even adhering to them all night. This\r\nmay be also the case in India; but I have only seen it recorded of\r\nAfrica.\r\n\r\nI should suppose that the loud blowing noise attributed to the African\r\nrhinoceros, holds good with all. The black variety is the most\r\ndangerous; they ramble about at night, and go to the river to drink,\r\nbetween the hours of nine and twelve. Those sudden fits of frenzy, to\r\nwhich all are liable, are particularly outrageous in them; and they have\r\nbeen seen to attack the bushes around them for hours at a time; uttering\r\na strange noise, something like the combination of a grunt and a\r\nwhistle. Their flesh is rather like beef, perhaps having even a finer\r\nflavour. They go about singly or in pairs, are much the most active, and\r\npursue any object which attracts them with a perseverance which is quite\r\nludicrous. According to Major Harris, much of the brain lies under the\r\nhorns, and he saw them sometimes assemble in herds of thirty-two. The\r\nbest place to aim at, when it is desirable to kill them, is behind the\r\nshoulder. Before they charge, they stand rolling their body from side to\r\nside. They become furious at the sight of fire, and in order to get at\r\nit, they dash forward with mad fury, nor rest till they have scattered\r\nand extinguished all the burning wood.\r\n\r\nThe White Rhinoceroses have a longer neck than the others. Their muzzle\r\nis shorter, and more square, resembling that of the ox.\r\n\r\nMost of the rhinoceroses brought to Europe have been remarkably\r\ngood-tempered and docile; but one which was lodged in Exeter Change, was\r\nonly kept in order by the whip; no kindness having any effect upon him,\r\nespecially in his sudden fits of fury, which were of the most frightful\r\nviolence.\r\n\r\nMr. Burchell's measurement of a rhinoceros, made him eleven feet from\r\nthe tip of the nose to the insertion of the tail, and the girth of the\r\nbody was eight feet four inches.\r\n\r\n\"Some years ago,\" says Captain Brown, \"a party of Europeans, with their\r\nnative attendants and elephants (of course this must have been in\r\nIndia) met with a small band of seven (rhinoceroses). These were led by\r\na larger, and more powerful animal than the rest. When this large leader\r\ncharged the hunters, the first elephants, in place of using their tusks\r\nas weapons, wheeled round, and received the blow of the rhinoceros's\r\nhorn on their hind quarters; and so powerful was the concussion, that it\r\nbrought them instantly to the ground with their riders; and as soon as\r\nthey could get on their feet again, the brute was ready to repeat the\r\nattack, and was certain to produce another fall; and in this manner did\r\nthe contest continue, until four of the seven were killed, when the rest\r\nmade good their retreat.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHORSES.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough, still lingering among the Pachydermata, I have now left behind\r\nme the ponderous and unwieldy forms which inhabit the wild and wooded\r\ntracts of the earth's surface, and come to the group called Solipeda,\r\nfrom the one round and horny hoof which encircles all the feet; one toe\r\nis apparent; and two points on each side, under the skin, represent\r\nlateral toes; besides which there is, underneath, a soft pad, or what is\r\ngenerally termed the frog, which touches the ground when the animal\r\nwalks.\r\n\r\nStrength, beauty, and activity, are all combined in horses; their\r\nelegantly shaped head, with its long pointed ears, and large eyes, is\r\ncarried high or thrown back; and while they rapidly glance into the\r\nhorizon, to look for friends or foes, their well defined nostrils sniff\r\nfresh vigour from the passing breeze; but this is not all--these same\r\nears laid flat back upon their head tell you that they have been\r\naffronted, and mean to be revenged for the insult; when they are upright\r\nthey are listening to sounds, which their rider cannot hear, and when\r\nthey are pointed forward they rejoice in the affectionate voices of\r\nthose whom they love. Those full, hazel eyes denote passions of various\r\nkinds, are often turned full of parental love on the offspring which\r\ngambols by their side, or of gratitude upon their kind masters,\r\nfollowing their benefactors with a melancholy look, when they take their\r\ndeparture. Those nostrils are dilated sometimes with anger, at others\r\nwith the pleasures of the chase; and the arched neck, the broad muscular\r\nchest, the graceful, curving lines of the body, the well-shaped, sinewy\r\nlimbs, sometimes slender and delicate in their proportions, bear these\r\nbeautiful creatures over hill and dale almost with the swiftness of a\r\nbird; while their long mane and tail float in the air, as if the\r\ncreature whom they adorn were about to soar to heaven.\r\n\r\nIn a state of freedom, horses are swift, fierce, and inquisitive; they\r\nherd together in large numbers. The males evince the most faithful\r\nattachment to the females, and protect them and their offspring to the\r\ndeath. The latter are fond and devoted mothers.\r\n\r\nIn activity, there is no animal which more decidedly takes its character\r\nfrom its early masters or instructors; their admirable qualities are\r\nheightened; their fierceness becomes courage; their wild actions are\r\nturned into play, and their attachment and sagacity are only surpassed\r\nby those of the dog. On the other hand, most of what are called their\r\nvices may be traced to their early training. Allowances must, of course,\r\nbe made for natural disposition, which varies as much in the brute\r\ncreation as it does in man; and I have met with ill-tempered horses,\r\nwhich have been so from the moment they were taken from their native\r\nforests; but generally speaking, the horse becomes the protector, the\r\ncompanion, the friend, of his possessor. When dead, every part of him is\r\nuseful; and when living, all his energies make him one of the greatest\r\nblessings which a beneficent Creator has bestowed on the earthly lord of\r\nall.\r\n\r\nHorses' teeth are so important a part of their history, that although\r\nthis book does not profess to treat of science, it would be incomplete\r\nif I did not briefly point out how distinctly they shew the age of the\r\nanimal. First of all, however, it should be known, that the mouth seems\r\nto have been expressly formed for the bit, by which man controls this\r\nadmirable creature; for, corresponding with each angle of the mouth is a\r\nspace between the teeth, in which it lodges with the greatest\r\nconvenience. The front teeth, or incisors, begin to appear when the\r\nhorse is fifteen days old, and amount to six in number in each jaw. All,\r\nfrom the first, are at the top, or crown, hollowed into a groove. The\r\ntwo in the middle are shed and replaced at three years and a half, the\r\ntwo next at four and a half, and the two outside, called the corner\r\nteeth, at seven and a half, or eight. The grooves on the crowns, become\r\neffaced, and the tops of the teeth are more triangular as age increases.\r\nThe females have no canine teeth; but the males always have two small\r\nones in the upper jaw, and sometimes two in the lower; the former appear\r\nwhen they are four years old, the latter at three and a half; they\r\nremain pointed till the horse has attained six years, and when he is ten\r\nthey begin to grow loose, and expose their roots. They have six grinders\r\nin each side of each jaw, with flat crowns, and the plates of enamel\r\nwhich surround the dental substance, appear in them like four crescents.\r\nThe life of horses generally lasts about thirty years; but they have\r\nfrequently been known to exceed that age. Then, however, mastication has\r\nbecome difficult, they get lean, or what is called out of condition; and\r\nold favorites, if they are attended to as they ought to be, after long\r\nand faithful services, have their food bruised, and even cooked for\r\nthem. It is surprising to see what entire rest frequently does for them,\r\neven at an advanced age; and I have seen them, in consequence of it,\r\nagain taken into a degree of service when they have been supposed past\r\nall work.\r\n\r\nThe origin of horses is involved in so much obscurity, that it has given\r\nrise to frequent speculation; not as in the dog, with regard to the type\r\nof the race, but the quarter of the globe where they were first located.\r\nIt appears to me, that the greatest mass of opinion is in favour of\r\nTartary, or Central Asia, where it is supposed that the only existing\r\nwild race now lives, all the rest in a state of freedom, being feral, or\r\ndescended from domesticated pairs, which have again become wild. Some of\r\nthese are also on the steppes of Tartary; but immense numbers inhabit\r\nthe extensive plains of South America, which are supposed to be the\r\ndescendants of the Spanish horses, and to have escaped from the\r\nconquerors of that continent. Large herds also run about in various\r\nparts of North America and Africa; and smaller numbers in England, where\r\nthey have dwindled to ponies. Mr. Bell, whose authority few would dare\r\nto dispute, thinks that the Egyptians were the first people who brought\r\nthe horse into subjection, and that Africa contained the original race;\r\nbut the ancient mysteries of the East are only now beginning to be\r\nopened to us; and, I suspect, we shall find that the Egyptians derived\r\ntheir horses, as well as everything else, from the still older Asiatics.\r\n\r\nIt would be in vain to attempt, in a work of this kind, to describe the\r\ndifferent species and varieties of horses; I shall, therefore, quickly\r\npass on to a small selection from the numerous anecdotes placed before\r\nme, a few of which are the results of personal experience. Before I do\r\nthis, however, it may be as well to make a few observations concerning\r\ntheir food. They are eminently vegetable feeders; grains and dried\r\ngrasses, such as hay and straw, also clover, being preferred when they\r\nare in constant service. The more valuable sorts are seldom much used\r\nwhile they are feeding entirely on green grass. They are extremely fond\r\nof the niceties which are so often bestowed on pets, such as bread,\r\napples, cakes, etc.; and some are passionately fond of sugar. M.\r\nFrederic Cuvier taught one he constantly rode, to play certain tricks,\r\nrewarding him for them with sugar; and, if the provision contained in\r\nhis pocket were not sufficient, he would stop at a road-side inn, and\r\nprocure some more for the horse. Accordingly, when the sagacious animal\r\ncame again to these houses, he would perform the same antics which had\r\nbefore procured him the sugar, and then stand still, as if again to\r\nreceive his reward. While speaking of this creature, I may as well\r\nmention, that he delighted in pulling down his own hay, and feeding the\r\ngoats, which lived on the other side of his palings, with it; and once,\r\nwhen he was fed with straw, on account of some malady, his companions,\r\nwho ate at the same manger, were so concerned at what they thought his\r\ninferior fare, that they pushed their hay to him.\r\n\r\nHorses have not the least objection to animal food; and it has been\r\noften given to them when they have been obliged to perform immense\r\njourneys, or to undergo any very great exertion. It, however, excites\r\nthem very much, and, if not judiciously bestowed, makes them fierce and\r\nuncontrollable. Stories are told of poor men, who, when the despots of\r\nthe East have ordered them to give up their favourite horses, have fed\r\nthem on flesh, and rendered them so unmanageable, that the tyrants have\r\nno longer desired what they once thought a prize. Horses will also drink\r\nstrong ale, etc., with the greatest relish; and oat gruel, mixed with\r\nit, has often proved an excellent restorative for them after an unusual\r\nstrain upon their powers. They will not refuse even spirits or wine,\r\nadministered in the same manner; but it is very questionable if these\r\nare equally efficacious. There is no telling, however, what strange\r\ninconsistencies domestication will produce in the matter of food; for\r\ncats have been known to refuse everything for boiled greens, when they\r\nwere to be had.\r\n\r\nThe following account is abridged from Mr. Kohl's description of those\r\nAsiatic horses, which are bred in the steppes, and are private property,\r\nalthough he calls them quite wild.--\"Only in the heart of Tartary can\r\nthe horse be found perfectly in a wild state. One herd in the steppe\r\nwill consist of 1000 horses; but the keepers of herds will have several.\r\nDressed in leather, with a girdle which contains the implements of his\r\nveterinary art; a black lambskin cap on his head, the _tabuntshik_, or\r\nherdsman, eats, drinks, and sleeps in his saddle; has no shelter, and\r\ndare not even turn his back upon a storm, as the creatures do for whom\r\nhe is responsible. In his hand he holds a whip, with a thick, short\r\nhandle, and a lash from fifteen to eighteen feet long. Then he must have\r\na sling, with which he takes unerring aim at each individual of his\r\nstraggling herd; then a wolf-stick, with a knob of iron at the end,\r\nhangs from his saddle; and a cask of water, a bag of bread, and a bottle\r\nof brandy are necessary parts of his equipment. He pays for every horse\r\nthat is lost; in ten years he is worn out, yet is unfit for any other\r\nlife; he lives in constant dread of horse-stealers, notwithstanding\r\nwhich he steals them himself.\r\n\r\n\"From Easter to October the herds graze day and night in the steppes. In\r\nthe winter they are sheltered at night by mounds of earth, and a sort of\r\nroof, from the north. The stallions and stronger horses take possession\r\nof the shed, and the rest stand outside, huddled together. In severe\r\nwinters, sickness and death overtake them, and those who survive, walk\r\nabout like specters. But when they eat the young grass, which appears\r\nwhen the snow is melted, they are as wild and mischievous as ever. The\r\nstallions seem to consider themselves as the chiefs of the herd; and one\r\nof these, by right of strength, is the chief _par excellence_. Sometimes\r\none stallion will have affronted the rest, and all combine to turn him\r\nout; and then he will be seen apart from them, with a few mares\r\nattending him.[7] Occasionally two herds will fight for right of\r\npasture; the mares and foals keep aloof, the stallions flourish their\r\ntails, erect their manes, rattle their hoofs together, and fasten on\r\neach other with their teeth; the victorious party carrying off several\r\nmares.\r\n\r\n\"In the spring come the wolves, being very fond of young foals; so they\r\nconstantly prowl round the herds, never attacking them by day if they\r\nare numerous; but come at night, and if they are scattered, they make a\r\nrush upon their victims. The stallions, however, charge at them; and\r\nthey take flight only, however, to return and secure a straggling foal,\r\nto whose rescue the mother comes, and herself perishes. When this is\r\nfound out, a terrible battle ensues; the foals are placed in the centre,\r\nthe mares encircle them, charging the wolves in front; tearing them\r\nwith their teeth, and trampling them with their fore-feet, always using\r\nthe latter, and not the hind feet; the stallions rush about, and often\r\nkill a wolf with one blow; they then pick up the body with their teeth,\r\nand throw it to the mares, who trample upon it till its original form is\r\nutterly destroyed. If eight or ten hungry wolves should pull down a\r\nstallion, the whole herd will revenge him, and almost always destroy the\r\nwolves; who, however, generally try to avoid these great battles, and\r\nchase a mare or foal separated from the rest, creep up to them,\r\nimitating a watchdog, and wagging their tails, spring at the throat of\r\nthe mare; and then the foal is carried off. Even this will not always\r\nsucceed, and if the mare give alarm, the wolf is pursued by herd and\r\nkeeper, and his only chance of escape is to throw himself head-foremost\r\ndown the steep sides of a ravine.\r\n\r\n\"The horses suffer more from thirst in summer than from famine in\r\nwinter; the heat is intolerable, there is no shade, and each horse tries\r\nto protect itself by its neighbour's body. In the autumn the owners of\r\nthe herd call them in to thresh corn; the turf is removed, the ground\r\nbeaten till it is very hard, and a railing placed round it; the corn is\r\nspread, and five hundred horses at a time are driven into the enclosure;\r\nthey are terrified by the crackling straw and the noise of the whip over\r\ntheir heads, and the more frantic they are the sooner is the corn\r\nthreshed.\"\r\n\r\nThe attachment of Arabs to their horses, the extreme beauty of these\r\nanimals, which form part of the family, and are sometimes more precious\r\nto their owners than wives or children, have become proverbial. They are\r\nmanaged by kindness; and nothing can exceed the indignation of the\r\nowners when they behold any attempt to manage a horse of any kind by\r\nmeans of the whip. It is the Arabian which, imported through Spain, or\r\ndirect to England, has produced so much improvement in the European\r\nstock. An Arab mare of pure descent, had, by means of the Moors, found\r\nher way to the north western coast of Africa, where she was purchased by\r\nan English officer. At first I was a little disappointed in her\r\nappearance, for she was thin; but as her foal became independent of her,\r\nand learned to eat, she recovered her condition, and I was never tired\r\nof looking at her. To all who delight in admiring wild, unrestrained\r\naction, there could not be a much greater treat than to have the gates\r\nof the Government-House spur closed, and turn her and her child loose\r\ninto it, while we stood upon the veranda to watch them. At no time did\r\nshe ever walk; but went every where with a light, dancing step. And on\r\nthese occasions the frolics, the gestures, were past all description;\r\nstanding at one corner, her fore feet stretched out, she would appear\r\nto wait for the pretty little son who trotted up to her; when, in a\r\nmoment, almost so as to elude sight, she would bound completely over\r\nhim, and take her stand at another corner; then back again, and round\r\nand round, till it seemed to me that all the tricks taught by Ducrow,\r\nthe waltzing and quadrilling excepted, must have been suggested by\r\nwatching the movements of wild horses. A curious adventure happened to\r\nthat little foal, which is worthy of record. A year or two after this,\r\nthe groom took him to the river to wash his legs, and as he turned to\r\ncome out again, a crocodile bit him; he struggled for a moment and fell;\r\nthis frightened the crocodile away, and the poor young horse was dragged\r\nfrom the water's edge; the formidable teeth of the reptile had nearly\r\nseparated the foot from the leg, and it hung by one tendon. There seemed\r\nto be no alternative but to shoot him; however, a native suggested to\r\nhis owner, that there was a famous Moorish doctor then in the place, and\r\nif any one could cure the horse, he could; at any rate it was worth the\r\ntrial: the man came, was very quiet, did not promise anything, but\r\nunited the parts, bandaged them together, had the patient fastened down\r\nin the position in which he chose him to lie, and after some weeks of\r\ncareful tending, the animal was restored to his master even without\r\nblemish. It was only by passing the hand along the parts which had been\r\nsevered, that the scar could be detected; and he was afterwards sold for\r\na handsome sum.\r\n\r\nM. de Lamartine tells an interesting story of an Arab chief and his\r\nhorse, which is highly characteristic. They, and the tribe to which they\r\nbelonged, attacked a caravan in the night, and were returning with their\r\nplunder, when some horsemen, belonging to the Pasha of Acre, surrounded\r\nthem, killed several, and bound the rest with cords. Among the latter\r\nwas the chief, Abou el Marek, who was carried to Acre, and, bound hand\r\nand foot, laid at the entrance of their tent during the night. The pain\r\nof his wounds kept him awake, and he heard his own horse neigh, who was\r\npicketed at a little distance from him. Wishing to caress him, perhaps\r\nfor the last time, he dragged himself up to him, and said--\"Poor friend!\r\nwhat will you do among the Turks? You will be shut up under the roof of\r\na Khan, with the horses of a Pasha or an Aga; no longer will the women\r\nand children of the tent bring you barley, camel's milk, or dhourra, in\r\nthe hollow of their hands; no longer will you gallop free as the wind in\r\nthe desert; no longer will you cleave the waters with your breast, and\r\nlave your sides, as pure as the foam from your lips. If I am to be a\r\nslave, at least you may go free. Return to our tent, tell my wife that\r\nAbou el Marek will return no more; but put your head still into the\r\nfolds of the tent, and lick the hands of my beloved children.\" With\r\nthese words, as his hands were tied, the chief, with his teeth, undid\r\nthe fetters which held the courser bound, and set him at liberty; but\r\nthe noble animal, on recovering his freedom, instead of galloping away\r\nto the desert, bent his head over his master, and seeing him in fetters,\r\nand on the ground, took his clothes gently between his teeth, lifted him\r\nup and set off at full speed towards home. Without resting he made\r\nstraight for the distant, but well-known tent in the mountains of\r\nArabia. He arrived there in safety, laid his master down at the feet of\r\nhis wife and children, and immediately dropped down dead with fatigue.\r\nThe whole tribe mourned him, the poets celebrated his fidelity; and his\r\nname is still constantly in the mouths of the Arabs of Jericho.\r\n\r\nThe Arabs have five noble races, among which that of Kohlan is the most\r\ncelebrated for its beauty, temper, courage, memory, and almost human\r\nintelligence.\r\n\r\nThe value which the Arabs themselves set upon their horses may, perhaps,\r\nbe exemplified, when I say, that the before-mentioned mare (Cora) had\r\nbeen brought to the coast in some secret manner; and as soon as it\r\ntranspired where she was, a comparatively insignificant Sultan of the\r\ninterior, sent to offer goods for her to the value of three hundred\r\npounds. When her master left Africa, he sold her to a general officer,\r\nand I never heard what became of her after that. The following is a\r\n_short_ pedigree of one of these valuable creatures:--\"In the name of\r\nGod, the merciful! The cause of the present writing is, that we witness\r\nthat the grey horse Derrish, of Mahomet Bey, is of the first breed of\r\nNedgdee horses, whose mother is the grey mare, Hadha the famous, and\r\nwhose father is the bay horse, Dabrouge, of the horses of the tribe\r\nBenihaled. We testify on our conscience and fortune, that he is the\r\nbreed concerning which the prophet said, 'the true runners, when they\r\nrun, strike fire; they grant prosperity until the day of judgment.' We\r\nhave testified what is known, and God knows who are true witnesses.\" Six\r\nsignatures verified this pedigree.\r\n\r\nI had marked out a selection of quotations as proofs of the high\r\nqualities of the noble horse; but I must now be as brief as possible,\r\nand not profit too much by the interesting labours of others. I\r\ntherefore continue my own observations. When staying on the borders of\r\nthe river Gambia, I saw two of the native horses which belonged to the\r\nstud of the Commandant there; they had been brought from the interior,\r\nand taken from a wild herd; but they were totally unlike the races\r\nhitherto described. The mare, of a reddish brown, had been some time\r\ndomesticated, and was docile and well behaved; neither of them\r\npossessing sufficient character to be referred to the Barb, the\r\nDongola, or the Nubian breeds. They were undersized, and not handsome;\r\nthe male, who had not been long from his native forests, was the best\r\nlooking; carried his head well, was strongly and compactly made,\r\nespecially about the shoulders, and there was much fire about the head,\r\nwhich, however, was far from handsome; his legs were slender and\r\nwell-shaped. The peculiar circumstances in which I was placed, rendered\r\nit necessary that I should, for the sake of health, take horse-exercise.\r\nThere was nothing which could carry me except this little grey horse;\r\nfor I could not persuade those around me to let me mount Cora, because\r\nthey said she had so hard a mouth: so a side-saddle was put on, and a\r\nman with a skirt tried the grey once or twice; he was tolerably quiet,\r\nand without much disturbance, he went pretty well for a few weeks; the\r\nonly trouble being to get upon his back. He, however, had one great\r\npeculiarity, which manifested itself rather awkwardly, when a party of\r\nus started to go to a distance. He could not endure strangers, and would\r\nnot suffer any of his own kind to approach him who did not live in the\r\nsame stable as himself. This was great affectation in a horse just wild\r\nfrom the woods, but so it was; the instant my companions approached me,\r\nhe made a bolt, his heels went into the air, and it was in vain to\r\nresist his fancy. We returned the next day, and while fording a creek,\r\nwhich we had crossed in a canoe the day before, one of our party forgot\r\nmy horse's peculiarity and came up to me; he darted fairly out to sea,\r\nand not till he found himself off his legs was he frightened;\r\nfortunately alarm made him tractable, and I easily turned his head and\r\nlanded in safety. Wishing however, to punish him, I galloped him home,\r\nfour miles through loose sand, which was over his fetlocks; far,\r\nhowever, from being subdued, when I had dismounted and went to pat his\r\ncheck, he tried to bite me.\r\n\r\nThe beauty and excellence of English horses, taken as a whole, have been\r\nacknowledged to surpass those of the rest of the world; their speed,\r\ntheir enormous leaps, their long journeys, their strength, have been\r\nfrequent themes of admiration; and I regret that I cannot fill more\r\npages, with the histories that are recorded of them; but there are many\r\nexcellent books on that subject alone, which may be read with great\r\nadvantage; and I pass on to a very clever hunter, called Nannie, who\r\nbelonged to my father, and who performed a feat, thought, in my\r\nchildhood, to be unique, but which I have of late seen mentioned in the\r\npapers, as accomplished by other horses. In those days, gentlemen seldom\r\nretired from the dinner table, without being at least elated; and, on an\r\noccasion of this sort, my father, by way of summing up his favourite's\r\nwonderful abilities, said, \"he was sure she would, at his bidding, jump\r\nover the supper table,\" which was then set out for about twenty persons.\r\nBeing an only daughter, I was often allowed to exceed the hours at which\r\nchildren are usually sent to bed; and I was therefore present during the\r\nwhole scene. Doubts were expressed, bets were laid, the parties became\r\nexcited; and Nannie was ordered from her stable, bridled and saddled, as\r\nif for her master's riding. She was led into the room; the gentlemen\r\nwere all assembled, the table was glittering with lights, glass, and\r\nsilver; the room was also brilliant; and at first, Nannie was a little\r\nsurprised. The chairs were set on each side of the room; but, as the\r\nseats were pushed under, they only added to the height; my father\r\nmounted, and said, \"Over, Nannie\": the docile creature poised herself on\r\nher hind legs, stretched out her neck, as if to measure the distance,\r\nand cleared the whole; the only ill effect arising from which, was, that\r\nthe marks of her hoofs were left in the carpet. This clever mare\r\nconstantly opened the door of her stable, and went to warm herself at\r\nthe fire in the harness-room; but her affection for her master had more\r\nthan once preserved his life. On one occasion, it is supposed, he had\r\nslipped off her, and been unable to get on again; when, overcome with\r\nsleep, he folded his arms, rested them against her side, and laying his\r\nhead upon them, remained there in a sound slumber. It was presumed they\r\nhad been in this posture a long time; and, had she moved, his life would\r\nprobably have been endangered by the fall, for they were close to a\r\nsteep declivity. On another occasion she came home, neighed at the door\r\nof the dwelling, and did not offer to go to the stable; the family were\r\naroused, servants rose, she trotted back, and stood by her master, who\r\nwas lying senseless by the side of the road. They must have fallen\r\ntogether, as on his chest was the mark of one of her feet, probably made\r\nin getting up again. He was only stunned, and in a few days recovered\r\nfrom his fall, while she was more than ever loved. She was a chestnut\r\nmare, with a white star; and very like her, was another, called Peggy,\r\nwhich, from having belonged especially to our mother, we, as children,\r\nclaimed as ours also; and I have always, when recollecting her, been\r\nable to picture to myself the intimacy between horses and human beings\r\nin an Arab family. We crawled over her, we seated ourselves upon her\r\nwithout bridle or saddle, we clung to her neck when she had no room for\r\nus on her back, and we sat upon her as she herself lay in her stall.\r\nWhen she was ill, we administered the medicine, almost quarreling as to\r\nwho should take the gruel to her; when she heard our voices, whatever\r\npain she was in, she saluted us with a neigh; she was patient under\r\nevery infliction, accommodated herself to every fancy, and, with her\r\nprudence and good temper, was often instrumental to our safety. Although\r\nshe had been a hunter, and was a lady's horse, she went well in harness,\r\nand used to run in a curricle, with all the fiery spirits whom my father\r\nchose to drive; and we must have been dashed to pieces more than once,\r\nbut for her steadiness and forbearance. At last, we were obliged to part\r\nwith her; that is, we were going to live where we could not keep her;\r\nand a friend took her into his park, where she was to remain free all\r\nthe rest of her life. Five years after, I was sitting at an open window,\r\nin the neighbourhood of the metropolis, and a sound met my ear. \"If ever\r\nI heard Peggy's step,\" I exclaimed, \"that is it; she is now coming along\r\nthe road.\" I was disbelieved; but in one minute after, the still\r\nbeautiful creature, though thirty-three years old, was at the gate: we\r\nrushed to her; we called her; she answered us; she danced about; she\r\nrubbed her face against ours; she looked for the same caresses, the same\r\nniceties which she used to get from us--and half an hour quickly passed\r\nin mutual caresses. The gentleman in whose park she had been living, had\r\nfound her so fresh, that he had ridden her by easy journeys, to London,\r\nand during his few days' visit, sent her to see us--she lived two years\r\nafter that, and died of old age, without a struggle.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WILD HORSES AND WOLVES.--Page 330.]\r\n\r\nA friend told me the other day, that a horse had been in the habit of\r\ngoing with his master a certain road, and stopping at the same inn,\r\nwhere those who fed him always threw some beans into the corn put before\r\nhim. After a time, he and his master went from that part of the country,\r\nand remained away for two years, then the same habits were resumed, and\r\nthe same inn frequented; the latter, however, had changed its owners.\r\nWhile enjoying his dinner, the rider was informed, that his horse would\r\nnot eat, that he appeared to be perfectly well, but there was something\r\nwrong about the corn, which they knew not how to rectify, for it was the\r\nvery best. The gentleman went to the stable, the horse neighed, looked\r\nat him, and then at the manger, and it struck him suddenly, that the\r\nanimal missed the food he had been accustomed to receive there, and no\r\nwhere else. \"Throw some beans in,\" he said to the hostler; he was obeyed;\r\nand the horse looked at him as if to express his thanks, and took his\r\nmeal contentedly.\r\n\r\nI terminate these anecdotes with one concerning a cart horse, which I\r\nnever saw in print, but once. He had frequently given proofs of great\r\nsagacity; but the chief was the following:--\"During the winter, a large\r\nwide drain had been made, and over this, strong planks had been placed\r\nfor our friend, the cart horse, to pass over to his stable. It had\r\nsnowed during the night, and had frozen very hard in the morning. How\r\nhe passed over the planks on going out to work, I know not; but, on\r\nbeing turned loose from the cart at breakfast, he came up to them, and I\r\nsaw his fore feet slip: he drew back immediately, and seemed for a\r\nmoment at a loss how to get on. Close to these planks a cart load of\r\nsand had been placed: he put his fore feet on this, and looked wistfully\r\nto the other side of the drain.\"\r\n\r\nThe boy who attended this horse, and who had gone round by another path,\r\nseeing him stand there, called him. The horse immediately turned round,\r\nand set about scraping the sand most vigorously, first with one hind\r\nfoot, then with the other. The boy, perhaps wondering what he was going\r\nto do, waited to see. When the planks were completely covered with sand,\r\nthe horse turned round again, unhesitatingly walked over, and trotted up\r\nto his stable and driver.\r\n\r\n[7] This seems to confirm the opinion of the Indians concerning the\r\nsolitary elephants.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ASS.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough far from equaling the horse in grace or beauty, the ass, in\r\nhis wild condition, is a handsome, swift, and powerful animal, so\r\ndifferent to the degenerated, ill-used, and scrubby creatures of this\r\ncountry, that they would scarcely be recognized as belonging to the same\r\nstock, if placed side by side. In Spain, and other parts of Southern\r\nEurope, and the Cape de Verde Islands, they are very superior; but they\r\nare even surpassed by those of the East. All acquainted with Scripture\r\nknow the importance formerly attached to them, when the wisest and best\r\nof the land rode in state upon white asses. It will also be recollected,\r\nthat the Israelites were at first forbidden to use horses, and the\r\nplaces of the latter were then supplied by asses. From the time,\r\nhowever, that the finer animals became common, asses seem to have fallen\r\ninto disrepute; and we read that the greatest of all beings, when\r\nperforming His Divine Mission upon earth, and was about to give himself\r\nup as a sacrifice for us, rode into Jerusalem upon an ass, thereby\r\nshewing his humility.\r\n\r\nAsses are eminently creatures of a warm climate, where they have a\r\nsmooth, sleek coat, well-made legs, and elevated carriage of the head.\r\nThey were introduced into Great Britain at an early period; for we hear\r\nof twelve shillings being paid for one in the time of Ethelred; but they\r\nare supposed to have become extinct, and to have been re-introduced in\r\nthe reign of Queen Mary, in consequence of our then intercourse with\r\nSpain. They are still in great perfection in Persia, where there are two\r\nvarieties, one kept for riding, and the other for carrying burthens. The\r\nformer are very strong, lift their legs well, and are broken in as\r\nhorses are; but the best are said to be natives of Arabia. They are not\r\nall larger than ours, a smaller variety being frequently met with, nor\r\nhave they all the dark streak across the shoulders. They are of a pale\r\nyellow, silvery grey, brown and reddish colors. The celebrated white\r\nasses are Albinos. All have a short black mane, a dark streak upon the\r\nback; and their tail, which so particularly distinguishes them from\r\nhorses, is covered with short hair, except at the tip, which is adorned\r\nwith a tuft, generally dark in color. Their peculiar cry or bray, is\r\nproduced by two small cavities in their windpipes; their hoofs are, in\r\nDamascus, made into rings, which the lower classes wear under their\r\narmpits, or round their thumbs, to save them from the rheumatism; their\r\nflesh is much esteemed as food among the Persians and Tartars. They are\r\nfond of congregating near Lake Aral in the summer, but go further to the\r\nsouth in winter. Vast hordes exist in Tartary, each headed by a chief.\r\nThey are also numerous in America, having probably been left there by\r\nthe Spaniards.\r\n\r\nMr. Bell describes an ass which belonged to his grandfather, who was so\r\nswift, that matches were made against him by the possessors of the\r\nfastest asses which could be found; but he beat them all, and even\r\nfollowed the hounds, coming up in gallant style, at the death of the\r\nfox.\r\n\r\nThe well-known antipathy between the horse and the ass is scarcely to\r\nbe explained, and has been often overcome; nevertheless, it always more\r\nor less exists, and many instances are on record in which it has caused\r\ninconvenience. One of these I can supply, which occurred when I was in\r\nPortugal. I started on a donkey to make a drawing of the great aqueduct\r\nwhich supplies Lisbon with its delicious water, and just as I had chosen\r\nmy position, and established myself, my husband rode up on a beautiful\r\nand valuable horse, belonging to a friend. He wished to procure some\r\nspecimens of the neighbouring rocks, and not liking to take a borrowed\r\nanimal among them, he desired my donkey guide to hold his steed as well\r\nas mine. The boy obeyed; and Mr. Bowdich soon disappeared among the\r\nhollows. For a few minutes the horse stood quietly enough; but from the\r\nbeginning he gave very significant glances at the companion forced upon\r\nhim. At last he worked himself into a complete passion; snorted,\r\npranced, reared, tossed his head, dilated his nostrils, and tried to\r\nreach the ass with his fore feet. He was prevented from doing this by\r\nthe boy, who opposed him with much temper and courage; he then tried to\r\nturn round and kick the object of his indignation, who was by no means\r\ndisposed to take the insult quietly. The boy let go the ass, who gave\r\none fling at the horse, and then went very quietly to nibble the grass,\r\nlying in patches on the rough ground. The horse, however, now tried to\r\nget at the donkey; broke his bridle, pursued him, and both scampered\r\noff, the former doing just the very thing Mr. Bowdich wished to avoid. I\r\nwas obliged to start up suddenly to get out of their way; my pencils and\r\npaper all made independent excursions, and the only thing to be done,\r\nwas for me to catch the donkey, and the boy to catch the horse. Mine was\r\nmuch the easiest task; but both being accomplished, we kept them apart,\r\nthe ass standing quietly enough, but the horse refusing to behave\r\nhimself unless the boy mounted on his back, and rode him up and down on\r\nthe smoothest path he could find. At length Mr. Bowdich returned, and\r\nthought all that had passed a good joke, in which I could not agree with\r\nhim. He rode away; and I quietly finished my sketch.\r\n\r\nBishop Heber gives the following description of an ass which he saw in a\r\npaddock, near Bombay, and which portrays a different disposition. He\r\nsays, \"it was a noble wild ass from Cutch, as high as a well grown\r\nGalloway, a beautiful animal, admirably formed for fleetness and power,\r\napparently very gentle and fond of horses, and by no means disliked by\r\nthem; in which respect the asses of India differ from all others of\r\nwhich I have heard. The same fact has been told me of the wild ass in\r\nRajpootana.\"\r\n\r\nOf the power of the ass to bear fatigue, the history of Mr. Wilson is\r\nan instance. He drove one which was his own property, in a light gig,\r\nfrom Ipswich to London, and back again, a distance of 140 miles, in two\r\ndays. The ass went at a pace little short of that of a good gig horse,\r\nand fed well at different stages. On his return, he came in without the\r\naid of a whip, at the rate of seven miles an hour, and performed the\r\nwhole journey with ease; he was twelve hands and a half high, and half\r\nbred Spanish and English.\r\n\r\nAsses, although they do credit to good feeding, can live on very little,\r\nand that little of inferior quality. They have a decided manner of\r\nrefusing to move when they are overloaded; and they are often seized\r\nwith an immovable fit without having any apparent reason for it. In\r\nsteep places they are invaluable, and their feet more sure than those of\r\nmen would be. I have seen them put both their fore feet out together,\r\nand let them slip, then drag their hind feet up to them, and repeat this\r\nprocess on descending the vitrified, and almost perpendicular roads of\r\nMadeira, taking a zigzag direction across the road each time. Mules do\r\nthe same, and perhaps derive the faculty from their asinine blood.\r\n\r\nThere cannot be a better proof of the intellect of asses, than by\r\nshewing them to be fond of the fine arts; therefore the account of one\r\nat Chartres, must enter into this work. \"He used to go to the Chateau\r\nd'Ouarville, to hear the music that was often performed there. The\r\nowner of the Chateau was a lady, who had an excellent voice; and\r\nwhenever she began to sing, he never failed to draw nearer the window,\r\nand listen very attentively. Once, when a piece was performed, which no\r\ndoubt pleased him better than any he had heard before, he left his\r\nordinary post, walked without ceremony into the music-room; and in order\r\nto add to the concert, what he thought perhaps might be an improvement,\r\nhe began to bray with all his might.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCAMELS.--DROMEDARIES.\r\n\r\n\r\nA peculiarity in the digestive organs of some animals causes all those\r\nwho possess it to be thrown together into one large order, by\r\nnaturalists. They have no front teeth, except in the lower jaw, and in\r\nplace of them, the upper jaw is provided with a bony pad. A very few\r\nhave canine teeth, and their grinders are marked with double crescents.\r\nThey have two hoofs, but as the inside edge of these is flattened, they\r\nlook as if they had only one cleft down the middle, the foot underneath\r\nis provided with elastic pads, connecting the toes together, and\r\nextruding beyond them at the sides. These cushions at each step expand,\r\nsupport the animal in yielding sand, and protect it on harder ground.\r\n\r\nAfter they have taken their food, these Ruminantia, as they are called,\r\nlie down, and remain in a state of complete repose, in order to chew it\r\na second time; and the process is thus accomplished: they have four\r\nstomachs, the first is called the paunch, and is the largest of all;\r\ninto it descend the grass, herbs, and leaves, when first cropped and\r\nimperfectly masticated. Thence the mass goes into the second stomach, or\r\nhoneycomb, so named, because its structure gives it the appearance of\r\nthat substance: it is small and globular, and by means of its cells,\r\nsqueezes the food into little balls, which are thrown up into the mouth\r\nof the animal, to receive a second mastication, called \"chewing the\r\ncud.\" After this has been effected, it descends into the third stomach,\r\nor the feck, which looks something like the several leaves of a book;\r\nlastly it goes into the fourth stomach, which is merely wrinkled. It is\r\nin this that real digestion takes place; all the previous labour having\r\nbeen but a mere preparation for it, and indicated by the name of the\r\norder, taken from a Latin word, signifying \"to chew over.\"\r\n\r\nIt would seem impossible for any animals to be more useful to man than\r\nthe dog or the horse, yet these Ruminantia are still more precious to\r\nhim, for while they serve him as beasts of burden, or transport, they\r\nperform agricultural labours and supply him generally with a variety of\r\nfood. Milk, butter, cheese, the very best meat, the strongest yet most\r\ndelicate leather, that most valuable commodity wool, hair, horn, and a\r\nlong list of utilities, all proceeding from them; while the extreme\r\nbeauty of many of the genera, and the sport they afford, contribute to\r\nhis mere pleasure, as well as his comfort.\r\n\r\nThe Camels and Dromedaries, which come first before me, are confined but\r\nto a small portion of the earth's surface; they, however, in their more\r\nconfined sphere afford incalculable benefits. Without them we should not\r\nbe able to traverse those large plains of sand, which lie between the\r\ndifferent countries of Africa, and also of south-western Asia. Their\r\ngaunt and angular form does not class them among the beauties to which I\r\nhave alluded; and the only pretensions which their outward appearance\r\ncan present for praise, is their admirable adaptation for the offices\r\nwhich they have to perform. Their full, upper lip is cleft, their neck\r\nis long, their eyes prominent and shaded with eye-lashes, their nostrils\r\nare like slits, which they can close at pleasure; their body has one or\r\ntwo humps on it, their legs have callous pads upon them, their feet are\r\nlarge and spreading, and their hair hangs loosely upon them in patches.\r\nThat long, upper lip, however, when the hot blast of the desert almost\r\ndries their mouth, plunges into the sand and finds momentary relief by\r\ngetting below the surface; that long ungainly neck raises the head so\r\nthat the prominent eyes may see objects in the far distance; those\r\nnostrils are apertures to the most acute organs of smell, by which they\r\ncan even ascertain that water is near; those callous pads enable them to\r\nkneel when they are to be laden, or mounted, and those ugly humps are\r\nprovisions of fat, which supply them with nourishment, if, during their\r\nlong journeys, there is a scarcity of provisions. One of their most\r\ninvaluable properties is the length of time which they can go without\r\ndrinking, owing to the large secretion of water in their honeycomb\r\nstomach, while in times of intolerable privation, they may be killed,\r\nand so save their masters from starvation.\r\n\r\nThe camel has two humps, the dromedary one; the last is the lightest and\r\nthe swiftest, and is generally chosen for riding, while the former\r\ncarries the burdens. High saddles are placed on their backs; and it\r\nrequires either to be used to them, or to be particularly careful not to\r\nbe half killed at starting. The rider places himself in the saddle while\r\nthe animals are kneeling; and, when they raise their hind legs, which\r\nthey do first of all, they send the unprepared traveller forwards, and\r\nhis breath is almost taken out of him by the blow which he receives upon\r\nhis chest; then as they get upon their fore legs they throw him back,\r\nso as to endanger his spine. Their pace is at first very disagreeable,\r\nbeing so long and slouching; but, generally speaking, they are extremely\r\ndocile and affectionate; they, however, will not stir if they think they\r\nare overloaded, and if they are made angry, they are furious, especially\r\nagainst each other, quarreling much more frequently with their own\r\nspecies than they do with man. Their owners are always very careful to\r\nsee that their humps are in good condition before they set off on a\r\njourney, and some varieties are preferred to others on account of their\r\nbeing able to bear a longer period of drought. They are generally\r\ndecorated with bells, the sounds of which, in their desert journeys, are\r\nsaid to be very agreeable to them. If once they fall from fatigue or\r\nsickness they seldom rise again; but, as a whole party, particularly\r\nwhen every day's provision of water is measured, cannot be stopped for\r\none, they are left alone to die; their eyes following the masters who\r\nare obliged to abandon them, and whom they have served so faithfully;\r\nthe vultures, already hovering over them, ready to pick their bones as\r\nsoon as they have sent forth their last breath. Their spine, when again\r\nfound, is often raised upon a pole, as a charm against the withering\r\nspell of the evil eye.\r\n\r\nThe load of a camel is about 800 lbs., and their usual pace nearly three\r\nmiles an hour; but at this rate they continue for nine or ten hours.\r\nTheir colour is chiefly a reddish brown, or grey, rarely black; and\r\noccasionally white. They are natives of the countries which they\r\ninhabit; the dromedary coming from Arabia and Africa, the camel from the\r\nmiddle of Asia, to the north of the Himalaya mountains. They are said to\r\nharbour revenge; but, if this be once gratified, they soon return to\r\ngood humour.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLLAMAS, ETC.\r\n\r\n\r\nLlamas are called the camels of the New World, and under this common\r\nname are included more than one species. They exist in large herds, and\r\nare much more sightly than the animals to which they are compared; their\r\nbacks are straighter, their heads very handsome, and their fleeces are\r\nthick and equal. They will carry a load of 150 lbs., and were the only\r\nbeasts of burthen found among the Peruvians, when these people were\r\nconquered by the Spaniards. Their feet differ from those of the camel,\r\nbut are equally adapted to the soil which they have to traverse; they\r\nare formed of two springy toes, each of which has a rough cushion\r\nunderneath, and a strong, short hoof on the tip, pointed and hooked,\r\nlike a claw. These take firm hold of the rapid and precipitous ascents\r\nand descents, which they encounter in travelling to and from the mines;\r\nin which journeys they carry 100 lbs. of metal over the rugged mountain\r\npasses, and perform a distance of about twelve miles during the day. At\r\none time 300,000 were employed by the Potosi mines alone. In one respect\r\nthey imitate camels by lying down, and refusing to stir when they are\r\noverloaded, and they never go beyond their usual pace. They spit in the\r\nface of their riders when tied up, or made to lie down; which is\r\nparticularly disagreeable, from the nature of their saliva.\r\n\r\nThe different species are not clearly defined, and we require a more\r\nintimate knowledge of them before we can separate them from each other:\r\nthe domestic animals are certainly Llamas; then there are the Guanacos,\r\nwhich are also called Huanacos. They live on mountains, but frequently\r\npasture in the plains; and when the females do this, the males watch\r\nfrom a more elevated position; and if they see men approaching, neigh\r\nsomething like a horse, to warn them of their danger, then descend into\r\nthe valley, and drive their charge before them.\r\n\r\nBesides these two, are the Vicunas (spelt also Vicunhas), and Vicugnas,\r\nwho are of a tawny red colour, and live in the bleak, cold parts of\r\nmountains, preferring frost and snow. They are remarkably swift and\r\ntimid, and their wool is very fine and silky.\r\n\r\nTo these must be added the Paco, or Alpaca, and the Taruga, who are\r\nlarger, and even swifter than the Vicunas, and wander about singly,\r\namong steep and rocky places. M. Frederic Cuvier thinks there are but\r\nthree species; the Guanaco, which, in a domestic state, is the Llama;\r\nthe Paco, or Alpaca; and the Vicuna. I am desirous of dwelling thus much\r\nupon these divisions, because the readers of South American travels are\r\noften much puzzled by the manner in which they are mentioned.\r\n\r\nThe Guanacos, when they have plenty of the rushy grass, on which they\r\nlove to feed, never require any drink, but they have no cells in their\r\nstomach for the secretion of water: they are particularly active in\r\nthrowing out their saliva at the least offence. They give very severe\r\nblows with their fore feet: and I have often, with the above gentleman,\r\nwatched them fight with a fury which was at first laughable, tearing\r\nlarge mouthfuls of hair from each other, and at last obliged to be\r\nseparated, from the injuries they were likely to give and receive.\r\n\r\nThe great enemy of these animals is the Puma, and they fly from him; but\r\nMr. Darwin says he has often known them not only neigh and squeak when\r\nmen approach, but dance and leap about in the most absurd manner. They\r\nare easily caught, for they get quite bewildered, when pursued; but they\r\nare much bolder when in captivity. They appear to have favourite spots\r\nto which they go to die, and which are perfectly white with their\r\nbones; this has been observed close to the river Gallego, and elsewhere.\r\n\r\nManufactures from their hair more resemble silk than woolen stuffs, and\r\nsome of those made of the Alpaca fleece, are quite black, without having\r\nbeen dyed. It has been a matter of surprise to many, that they are not\r\nnaturalized in this country, as the climate would not be an obstacle to\r\nsuccess. The demand, however, for their produce so much, increases, that\r\nit is very probable they may at some future time become denizens of our\r\nmountainous districts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDEER.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe elegant animals included under the name of Deer, afford the highest\r\nsport to the hunter, the most precious skins, and delicious food.\r\nConsidering their size, they are matchless in speed and vigour, and are\r\nas beautiful as they are swift. They are spread all over the globe,\r\nexcept Australia, and Central and Southern Africa; their place in the\r\nlatter continent being supplied by giraffes and antelopes. They leave\r\nthe higher mountains to goats, live on moderate elevations, but delight\r\nmost in wide, open countries. The fissures, or what are called\r\nlachrymals, exist in most of them; they are clefts below the eyes, which\r\nbear the name of tear-ducts, but their use is not yet understood. They\r\nwould not be so much developed as they are in many, unless they bore\r\nstrongly upon the animal's economy; but they do not communicate with the\r\nnose, nor are they, in any way, connected with respiration. They are\r\ncertainly in relation with glands, because they secrete a greasy fluid,\r\nmore abundant at some times than at others, when the edges are much\r\nswollen; and the animals often touch objects with them, stretching them\r\nwide open, doing so, when they are under excitement of any kind.\r\n\r\nThe muzzles of some deer are nearly flat, and destitute of hair; in\r\nothers, they are covered with hair, and the upper lip is prehensile.\r\n\r\nOnly the male deer have horns, or antlers, as they are called, which\r\nthey shed every year; and, up to a certain age, at every renewal, they\r\nincrease in size and number of branches. They are placed on a bony pad\r\nupon the forehead, which is covered with skin; and in the second year of\r\ntheir age, this skin swells; blood rushes towards the pads, their\r\narteries increase, and rapidly deposit bony matter, the antlers begin to\r\nform, the skin increases with them, and continues to cover them, and the\r\nlarge arteries which it carries with it make furrows upon the bony\r\nmatter, which always remain. So thick and soft is the pile of hair which\r\nprotects the skin, that it deserves, and has received, the name of\r\nvelvet. When the antlers have attained their yearly size, the arteries\r\nbegin to deposit a rough ring of bone round the edges of the pad, which\r\nincreases till it stops their passage; so that, deprived of its natural\r\nnourishment, the velvet shrivels up, dries, and peels off; a process\r\nwhich the deer hastens by rubbing his antlers against trees. The latter\r\nare then hard and serviceable, for had they been used and wounded, when\r\ntheir covering was so full of blood, the shock would have sent a rush of\r\nit back to the brain, and probably have killed the deer. Before I\r\nunderstood this arrangement, I have seen these animals with wounded\r\nhorns, and have wondered much at the large flow of blood which issued\r\nfrom them, and others have probably done the same. When the skin is\r\ngone, the antlers remain, as it were mechanically, and as it is one of\r\nthe great laws of life to throw off every thing which is no longer a\r\npart of itself, they obey the rule. Absorption takes place beneath the\r\nbony ring, particle after particle disappears, and down go the antlers,\r\neither from their own weight, or some accidental touch; the part where\r\nthey stood is quickly covered with skin till spring returns, when a new\r\ngrowth commences, and a larger pair ensues. The common stag loses his\r\nantlers early in the spring; and they sprout forth again very soon\r\nafter.\r\n\r\nThere is no part of the game laws of various countries more stringent,\r\nthan that which relates to the killing of deer, or their management.\r\nWhatever concerned Venerie, as it was called, was a necessary part of a\r\nnobleman's or gentleman's education. The private histories of kings are\r\nvery much mixed up with the deer laws, and also some of the public\r\ntransactions; for many a fine has been paid, many a worthy person sent\r\ninto exile, and many a life lost, in consequence of their infringement;\r\nand the technicalities with which the science and the laws were loaded,\r\nappear in the present times most absurd and tiresome.\r\n\r\nDeer are still to be found wild in Scotland, but most rarely in England;\r\nin the north of Europe and America they are common, and those which\r\nfrequent cold countries have the antlers much flattened, as if to shovel\r\naway the snow; they will sometimes weigh 60 lbs. These animals are every\r\nwhere tenacious of life, and will run a long way after being hit in a\r\nmortal part.\r\n\r\nRein-deer, which form the wealth of the Laplanders, serve them for food\r\nand clothing, draw them over pathless fields of snow in safety, and are\r\nthe only species really domesticated. They eat a lichen which they find\r\nunder the snow, during the winter, and live together in large herds.\r\nThey are the least handsome of the whole tribe; are perfectly obedient,\r\nand one man sometimes possesses as many as two thousand. Their joints\r\ncrack as they move, and they are extremely fond of salt; even taking it\r\nfrom the hands of strangers. They usually run at the rate of ten English\r\nmiles the hour, but have gone nineteen, and draw a weight of 300 lbs;\r\nbut they require good driving, and sometimes dash on, perfectly\r\nregardless of the comfort of those in the sledge. Their smell is very\r\nacute; and by it they are enabled to come up with their party, if they\r\nshould have been left behind. They suffer intensely from insects,\r\nespecially from a large species (_oestrus tarandi_), which deposits its\r\neggs in the hole made by its bite. In order to avoid these pests, the\r\nrein-deer are driven during the summer months to the mountains which\r\noverhang the coasts, where their foes are much less numerous. They are\r\nso terrified at their approach, that the sight of one will make them\r\nfurious.\r\n\r\nMr. Wentzel says that the Dog-rib Indians go in pairs to kill rein-deer,\r\nthe foremost carrying in one hand the horns and part of the skin of a\r\nhead of the deer, and in the other, a small bundle of twigs, against\r\nwhich he, from time to time, rubs the horns, as the deers do. His\r\ncompanion follows exactly in his footsteps, holding the guns of both in\r\na horizontal position; so that the muzzle of each projects under the arm\r\nof the first. Both have a fillet of white skin round their foreheads,\r\nand the foremost a strip of the same round each wrist. They gradually\r\napproach the herd, raise their legs very slowly, and put them down again\r\nsuddenly, in the manner of deer.\r\n\r\nIf any of the herd see them, they stop, and the head is made to play its\r\npart by copying their movements. By these means the hunters get into the\r\nvery centre of the herd without exciting suspicion; the hindmost man\r\nthen pushes forward his comrade's gun, and both fire nearly at the same\r\ninstant. The deer scamper off, the hunters trot after them; the poor\r\nanimals soon halt to see what alarmed them; their enemies have reloaded\r\ntheir guns as they proceeded, and give them a second discharge. The\r\nconsternation of the deer increases, they run about in the utmost\r\nconfusion, and the greater number are frequently thus destroyed.\r\n\r\nI have already spoken of dogs which attach themselves to communities,\r\nand now I have a similar instance of a deer to offer, in combination,\r\nhowever, with a dog, who attached himself to the 42nd Highlanders,\r\nhaving been presented to that regiment by a friend of one of the\r\nofficers. The dog had belonged to a captain in the navy, who dined at\r\nthe mess, while the regiment was stationed in Malta, and so attached\r\nhimself to that community, that nothing would induce him to leave it; so\r\nhis master was forced to leave his favourite Newfoundland behind him;\r\nwho, from that moment, would never follow any one who did not wear the\r\nuniform of his friends. The soldiers subscribed, and gave him a collar\r\nwith the name of the regiment on it, and called him Peter. A mutual\r\nattachment soon took place between the deer and the dog; and they\r\nregularly appeared on parade together. The latter frequented the\r\ncook-house, where the cook ill-treated him, which was not forgotten, and\r\none day when the bathing time was come, at which recreation Peter was\r\nthe first in and the last out of the water; the cook joined the others\r\nof his corps; and Peter, knowing his power in his own element, pulled\r\nhim down, and would have drowned him, had not the soldiers come to his\r\nrescue.\r\n\r\nBoth dog and deer marched with the band, and remained with it when in\r\nquarters. The latter was very fond of biscuit; but if it had been\r\nbreathed upon he would not touch it, and although many ways of cheating\r\nhim were tried, he invariably detected the contamination. At one time he\r\nbecame very irritable; and if a stranger passed between the band and the\r\nmain body of the regiment, he attacked him with his antlers. He was\r\ngrazing one day when a cat from the neighbourhood bristled up her hair,\r\nand set up her back at him; and the poor deer, seized with a sudden and\r\nunaccountable panic, sprang over a precipice two hundred feet high, and\r\nwas killed on the spot. Peter being close by, rushed to the battlements,\r\nand barked and yelled most piteously. His own end was a tragic one; he\r\nsnarled at an officer who had often ill-used him, and the unfeeling man\r\nordered the poor dog to be shot by those who loved him, and lamented him\r\nas long as they lived.\r\n\r\nThe smallest of the deer species lives in Ceylon; a lovely, delicate\r\nlittle creature, with lustrous eyes, and of exquisite form. When full\r\ngrown it is only ten inches high, fourteen long, and weighs about five\r\npounds. Its throat, head, and neck, are all white; its body is grey,\r\nstriped with black, and spotted at equal distances with yellow. Although\r\nvery timid, it is to be tamed; but if angry, it kicks out its little\r\nhind legs, and slender pointed hoofs, with great violence. One which was\r\ndomesticated was placed on a dinner-table, where it ran about and\r\nnibbled fruit from the dishes; answered to its name, and returned the\r\ncaresses which were bestowed upon it. Its terror of dogs was at first\r\nvery great; but at last it allowed a small terrier to come close to it;\r\nand heard the bark of others without being uneasy. A pair were brought\r\nto England, but soon died from inflammation of the lungs; the common and\r\nfatal disease which attacks almost all tropical animals in this climate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGIRAFFES.\r\n\r\n\r\nSome years ago, giraffes were thought to be fabulous animals; and the\r\nill-treated Le Vaillant was supposed to have _invented_ them, in spite\r\nof the description which the Romans left of them. He was a little\r\npoetical in his style of writing, which John Bull is not fond of when\r\nfacts are narrated, so John Bull begged to doubt his assertions. He\r\nlived, however, to see his veracity established, which the kind old man,\r\na year or two before his death, assured me was a great happiness to him.\r\nLord Caledon brought a skin home from the Cape, and badly as it was\r\nstuffed, it began to dawn on the minds of the Europeans, that such an\r\nanimal really existed. Then a live one was brought to Paris, and another\r\nto His Majesty George the Fourth, who petted his till it died. Now there\r\nare several living in our Zoological Gardens; some of whom were born in\r\nthe Menagerie.\r\n\r\nThe great peculiarity of the giraffes lies in possessing a very short\r\nbody, and very long legs; which formation involves a multitude of\r\nawkward movements; for instance, when they walk fast there is a jerking\r\nin the pace, as if it were not easy to them; and when they gallop, the\r\nhind feet often project beyond the fore feet. Their very long neck is\r\nnot arched, but bends obliquely from the shoulders, so that when they\r\nwish to drink from the ground, they are obliged to hold their fore legs\r\nvery widely apart. They look best when going slowly, at which time their\r\nstep is very stately, and their beautiful head is borne loftily above\r\nother animals; they have two short, bony horns covered with skin, and a\r\nprominence of bone on the top of the forehead; they have large, full\r\neyes, with which, owing to their convex form, they can see immense\r\ndistances in all directions; their ears are long and flexible, and they\r\nhave a long, black, prehensile tongue; with this they drag down the\r\nbranches of the trees on which they browse. Their upper lip is very\r\nflexible and projects over the under, which greatly assists them in\r\nprocuring their food; their tail is long, and has a tuft at the end;\r\ntheir skin is very glossy, is covered with large angular spots, and is\r\noften an inch and a half thick. Their great enemy is the lion, who\r\nsprings upon them when they are drinking, and the affrighted giraffes\r\nstart with all the speed of a swift courser, their enemy on their back,\r\nnor stop till they fall from exhaustion or loss of blood. They were\r\nnever heard to utter a sound, and therefore are supposed to be perfectly\r\nmute, even when wild.\r\n\r\nI was living in Paris when the giraffe, sent to that country, arrived.\r\nShe and her keeper, Ati, landed at Bordeaux, amidst most enthusiastic\r\nacclamations, which accompanied them all the way to the metropolis. A\r\ndeputation from each large town through which she passed, formed of the\r\nmunicipal authorities, met her, and one of the most learned savants,\r\nwent all the way from the Jardin des Plantes, and accompanied her on\r\nher triumphal march. \"La giraffe,\" however, did not appreciate these\r\nhonours, and she was often impatient under the etiquette imposed on her.\r\nOn one occasion she broke loose from her cavalcade, Ati and all, and\r\ndashing among the horsemen, scattered them right and left, some on and\r\nsome off their steeds; a dignified mayor lay in the dust, and by his\r\nside rolled the pains-taking savant who performed so long a journey in\r\nher service. The enthusiasm did not abate when she reached her\r\ndestination. Thirteen thousand more than the usual weekly number passed\r\nover the Pont d'Austerlitz alone, and as the public curiosity did but\r\nincrease for six weeks, steps were obliged to be taken to prevent the\r\nmultitude from pressing upon her. There were several natives of the East\r\nat that time in the French capital; and they went among others to see\r\nher. The moment she beheld their turbans, she stretched her neck out and\r\nlicked their foreheads, no doubt recognizing their head-dresses. Her\r\nlove for roses was very great; and she eagerly snatched them from those\r\nwho carried or wore them, to their great astonishment; for few could\r\ncalculate on the distance which she could reach. I went one day into her\r\npark, holding some carrots in my hand, with some of which I fed her,\r\nthen turning to the cows, lying at some distance, who had come with her\r\nto afford a supply of milk for her on the voyage, I began to give some\r\nto them. Without moving her legs from the place where I had left her,\r\nshe stretched her long neck and head over my head, and hooking the\r\ncarrots up with her tongue, surprised me not a little, for I could not\r\ntell what shadow was coming over me. She was as fond of onions as of\r\ncarrots; and this is not surprising, for they are very sweet and mild in\r\nher native country. Her Darfur attendant, Ati, slept in a gallery at the\r\ntop of her stables, and there was very little repose for him after\r\ndaylight; she routed him up with her nose, and seemed to think because\r\nshe was stirring he ought also to be on the alert. This was rather\r\nagainst his ideas on the subject, as he was apt to stay out late at the\r\ndances in the neighbouring _guinguettes_; and he used to complain, all\r\nthe time loving her very dearly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nANTELOPES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe many characters which antelopes possess in common with deer, seem to\r\nplace them together; but naturalists have ranked them among those\r\nRuminantia who have hollow horns. They are some of the most beautiful\r\nanimals in the world, and are sub-divided into sections, which depend on\r\nthe shape of their horns, but into which classification the present work\r\ndoes not enter. The exquisite Gazelle, the type of Eastern beauty, the\r\npoet's theme, with her slight and graceful shape, her slender limbs,\r\nand her full, dark eyes, often meets with a fate which has no poetry in\r\nit; for she is the favourite morsel of the lion and the leopard. It\r\nmight have been thought, that they would have preferred larger and more\r\nfleshy game, but, like true epicures, the high flavour of the gazelle is\r\npreferred to size. The falcon is often used by men for catching them, as\r\neven the swift greyhound cannot overtake them; they are also driven into\r\ntraps, by surrounding them, in the manner of a battle. Their skin is\r\nused in making a peculiar sort of drum.\r\n\r\nThe pigmy antelope inhabits some parts of Africa, and, in size,\r\ncorresponds with the small deer of Ceylon. I never saw so beautiful a\r\nlittle creature, appearing more like a fable than a reality. Their tiny\r\nblack horns are but slightly curved inwards, their legs are not thicker\r\nthan the quill with which I am now writing; and yet all the characters\r\nof the antelope are strongly marked. The first I saw had been brought to\r\nmy uncle; and as I entered his room, I stood quite still at the door,\r\nwith surprise at this exquisite, tiny creature, who remained with one\r\nleg up, ready to dart away with the speed of lightning from the\r\nintruder, for whose approach he was listening. I feared to move, lest\r\nthe vision should disappear; but death soon made it fade away\r\naltogether. Captain Fisher, of the Navy, tried to take a pair of these\r\nfairy-like creatures to England; they were kept in his own cabin, he\r\ngave them all the goat's milk which had been provided for his own use,\r\nand took infinite pains to shelter them from cold or accident; he\r\nsucceeded in getting them as far as the Channel, where they ate some\r\npieces of cork which had been dropped on the floor, and died. I was\r\nequally unfortunate with a beautiful, spotted antelope, which was\r\nbrought to me; and which never could stand in the house. It had not been\r\nhurt; but the instant it was put upon its legs, it slipped about, and I\r\nwas told this species always did so. I fed it, carried it about, and it\r\nwas very gentle, and began to know me, though still wild. It died at the\r\nend of a fortnight, in strong convulsions.\r\n\r\nAntelopes are exclusively inhabitants of the Old World; and some idea\r\nmay be formed of their immense numbers in South Africa, where the\r\nspecies are most varied and powerful, by reading the following\r\nquotations from Mr. Pringle, and Mr. Gordon Cumming. The former\r\nsays--\"We pursued our journey over extensive plains, still parched by\r\nsevere drought, and undulating heights clothed with a brown and scanty\r\nherbage, and sprinkled over with numerous herds of springbok. Near the\r\nbanks of the Little Fish river, so numerous were those herds, that they\r\nliterally speckled the face of the country, as far as the eye could\r\nreach; insomuch that we calculated we had sometimes within view not less\r\nthan 20,000 of these beautiful animals. As we galloped on, they bounded\r\noff continually, on either side, with the velocity from which they\r\nderive their colonial appellation. They were probably _part_ of one of\r\nthe great migratory swarms which, after long-continued droughts,\r\nsometimes inundate the colony from the Northern wastes.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Cumming informs us, that, \"When pursued, the springbok jumps up into\r\nthe air ten or twelve feet, for which they curve their loins, rise\r\nperpendicularly, and the long white hair on their haunches and back\r\nfloats about; they pass over a space of twelve to fifteen feet, come\r\ndown, then rise again; and after doing this several times, they bound\r\noff, arch their necks, then halt, and face their enemy. If they come to\r\na place over which men or lions have walked, they jump across it. They\r\ncan only be compared to locusts; for they eat up every green thing, and\r\nalways return to their haunts by a different road to that which they had\r\npreviously passed. Their herds consist of tens of thousands; and where\r\nthey have staid for some time, thousands of skulls strew the plain.\" In\r\nanother part of his book, the same author tells us, that the ground was\r\nliterally covered with them, forming a dense, living mass, marching\r\nslowly, and pouring like a great river for hours: hundreds of thousands\r\nscarcely tell their number. \"I give you my word,\" said a boer, \"that I\r\nhave ridden a long day's journey, over a succession of flats covered\r\nwith them as far as I could see, as thick as sheep standing in a fold.\"\r\n\r\nAmong the Antelopes of the same part of the world is the Oryx, or\r\nGemsbok, a very beautiful animal, which has been supposed to give rise\r\nto the Unicorn of Sacred writings; \"for its long, straight horns, always\r\nso exactly cover one another, when viewing them from a distance, that\r\nthey look like one. They have an erect mane, a long tail, and are like a\r\nhorse, with the head and hoof of an Antelope. Their bearing is most\r\nnoble, they are the size of an ass, have black bands about the head,\r\nlooking like a stall collar. They live in almost barren regions, never\r\nwant water, are very swift, and only to be caught by riding down.\"\r\n\r\nThe fierce Gnoo, Gnu, or _Blue Wilde Beest_ of the colonists to the\r\nnorth of the Cape of Good Hope, are not as numerous as the spring-boks;\r\nand are easily distinguished by their large, curving horns, and the\r\ndownward carriage of their head; for they never can look up. One was\r\nfound with a fore leg caught over his horn, and so was easily secured;\r\nfor he could not, of course, run, and had probably got himself into that\r\nattitude when fighting. They have a shaggy head, long hair or mane upon\r\nthe chest, a long white tail, and wild red eyes. They utter fearful\r\nsnorts, and kick and leap about in the most grotesque and fantastic\r\nmanner. If a red handkerchief be held before them, it produces the most\r\nviolent excitement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGOATS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe three last genera of which I shall treat are all Ruminantia, and are\r\ndistinguished by their horns, which are divided into cells; and which\r\ncells communicate with the skull. The two first, goats and sheep, so\r\nclosely resemble each other, that in many instances the one appears to\r\nbe a mere variety of the other. If we look at the Merino breed, with its\r\nclosely curled, soft, white wool, and then turn to a grave-looking goat,\r\nwith its long beard and hair, we shall not be conscious of their\r\nresemblance; but if we place a sheep that has long resided in, or been\r\nborn in a tropical country, by the side of the goat, we shall scarcely\r\nbe able to distinguish one from the other. The wool gradually uncurls,\r\nlengthens, and becomes harsh and glossy; and were not the goat's horns\r\ndirected upward, and then inclined backwards, those of the sheep\r\ndirected backwards and returned to the front in a spiral form; had not\r\nthe goats, generally speaking, a long beard, and the sheep none, and had\r\nnot the goats a concave or flat forehead, and the sheep mostly a convex\r\none, we should not be able to separate them; and even these\r\ncharacters--if not well defined--are not very conspicuous, unless to a\r\npractised, or careful observer.\r\n\r\nThe Chamois, which is classed by many among goats, in some degree\r\napproaches the antelopes. Its horns shoot straight up, and then at the\r\ntips turn suddenly back, like a fish hook; it frequents all the mountain\r\nchains of Europe and western Asia; in summer climbing to the highest\r\nsummits, and displaying the most daring agility. In the winter it comes\r\ndown just below the regions of perpetual snow, for the sake of\r\nnourishment. Its smell, sight, and hearing, are very acute, and it will\r\ndetect the approach of a hunter at the distance of half a league. When\r\nfrightened, it bounds from rock to rock, making a strange hissing sound;\r\ndashes itself across the most fearful chasms, and throws itself down\r\nprecipices of thirty feet. It feeds on herbs and flowers, and the young\r\nshoots of shrubs; seldom drinks, and is extremely fond of salt. As some\r\nof the rocks of the Alps contain saltpeter, the chamois has worn holes\r\nin them by constant licking.\r\n\r\nAs with other domesticated animals, there are many disputes as to the\r\noriginal country of Goats; but most naturalists seem inclined to think\r\nthat the first stock was placed in Persia; but it is a question involved\r\nin much obscurity. In very far-off times, when superstition and medicine\r\nwent hand in hand, and charms were deemed more efficacious than drugs, a\r\nhard substance found in the intestines of goats, was greatly valued as a\r\ncure for most disorders. It was called the bezoar stone, and was a\r\nconcretion chiefly of resinous bile and magnesia, and the rest inert\r\nvegetable matter. It was sold for ten times its weight in gold, and was\r\nsaid to come from some unknown animal, to increase the mystery belonging\r\nto it. Bezoars are now found in oxen, sheep, horses, porcupines, and\r\neven the human subject, slightly varying in their construction, and are\r\noften balls of hair, which has been licked off the animal's own coat.\r\n\r\nThe Angora and Cappadocian Goats are famed for their long, silky hair,\r\nwhich yields beautiful manufactures; but they are far surpassed by the\r\ngoats of Thibet, the under wool of which is combed off, and made into\r\nthose shawls which have for years been so famous and so costly. It takes\r\nthe produce of ten goats to make a shawl a yard and a half square; the\r\nwool is bleached with rice flour, and the heavy taxes levied upon them,\r\nmakes these unequaled shawls keep up their high price. From the\r\nearliest times we read of goat's hair being woven into cloth of varied\r\nquality, especially in scriptural writings; and their skins have always\r\nafforded valuable leather. That of the kid is of the finest quality.\r\n\r\nAll goats are hardy and wandering in their habits, and frequent those\r\nplaces where no other animal could gain a footing. They exist in a feral\r\nstate in the mountainous parts of our island, and throughout Europe and\r\nWestern Asia. There is always much attachment between them and horses,\r\nwhen domesticated. Some say it is in consequence of the strong odour\r\nwhich is emitted by goats; and others because the horse, who so loves\r\ncompanionship, delights in their vivacity. They vigorously defend their\r\nyoung, as the following anecdote will shew. \"A person having missed one\r\nof his goats, when the flock returned at night, desired two boys to\r\nwatch all night, that she should not get into his young plantation, and\r\nnibble off the tops of the trees. At daybreak the watchers looked for\r\nthe missing animal, and saw her on a pointed rock at some distance.\r\nDuring the night she had given birth to a kid, and was then defending it\r\nfrom a fox. The latter went round and round, but she turned her horns\r\nupon him in all directions. The younger boy went to procure assistance,\r\nand the elder hollowed and threw stones to frighten away the marauder.\r\nReynard looked at him, saw he was not strong enough to master him, and\r\nsuddenly tried to seize the kid. All three disappeared; and were found\r\nat the bottom of a precipice; the goat's horns were stuck into the fox,\r\nthe kid lay stretched beside her, with a lacerated throat, and it was\r\nsupposed; when the death-wound was inflicted by the poor mother, the fox\r\nstaggered, and dragged her and her child with him in his fall.\" (Capt.\r\nBrown's \"Popular Natural History.\")\r\n\r\nA goat and her kids frequented a square in which I once lived, and were\r\noften fed by myself and servants; a circumstance which would have made\r\nno impression, had I not heard a thumping at the hall door, which arose\r\nfrom the buttings of the goat when the food was not forthcoming, and\r\nwhose example was followed by the two little things. After a time this\r\nremained unheeded, and to our great astonishment, one day, the area bell\r\nused by the tradespeople, and the wire of which passed by the side of\r\none of the railings, was sounded. The cook answered it; but no one was\r\nthere save the goat and kids, with their heads bent down towards the\r\nkitchen window. It was thought that some boy had rung for them; but they\r\nwere watched, and the old goat was seen to hook one of her horns into\r\nthe wire, and pull it. This is too much like reason to be ascribed to\r\nmere instinct.\r\n\r\nThe Caucasian Ibex, is a goat which affords as much dangerous and\r\nexciting sport as the chamois, but is more savage; and has been known to\r\nturn round on its pursuer, and hurl him down a precipice. It has a\r\nremarkable way of throwing itself down these steep places, head\r\nforemost, so as to light upon its horns; which being elastic, bear the\r\nshock, and save the animal from injury. They pasture in the valleys at\r\nnight, and return during the day to the mountains.\r\n\r\nIn countries where bulls and cows will not live, goats are invaluable.\r\nTheir flesh is like bad mutton; but long absence from South downs, makes\r\nthe appetite less dainty, and their kids are very delicate. However, it\r\nis chiefly for their good, nourishing milk that they are to be prized.\r\nThe horns of goats are often used by Mussulmans, as an antidote to the\r\nevil eye.\r\n\r\nBishop Heber relates the following anecdote. \"A monkey came down from a\r\ntree to steal the breakfast of a shepherd, who was resting under it with\r\nhis flock of sheep and goats. He drove the monkey away, who, in his\r\nhurry, upset a bee's nest. The insects flew out, and attacked not only\r\nthe intruder, but the goats and sheep underneath. The curious part was\r\nto watch the different behaviour of the two species. The sheep crowded\r\ntogether, buried their noses in the sand, and did not attempt to resist,\r\nbut bleated piteously. The goats all ran as fast as they could to an\r\nencamping party close by, seeking the assistance of man, as dogs would\r\nhave done.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSHEEP.\r\n\r\n\r\nIT is but little necessary to descant here on the different fleeces, and\r\nvarious flavours of mutton which the numerous breeds of sheep afford.\r\nThe least reflection and observation, teach us their unspeakable value\r\nas sources of food, clothing, and other purposes; my task therefore lies\r\nwith their dispositions and comprehensions. The last anecdote related\r\nshews, that they have more patience, but less courage and resource, than\r\nthe more lively companions with whom they are so frequently associated,\r\nand whom they so much resemble. In many instances, however, maternal\r\ninstinct has called forth their powers to a degree which has caused\r\nsurprise; and they have been known to traverse considerable distances to\r\nseek the assistance of their own kind, or of their shepherd, when their\r\nlambs have been in danger. Moreover, a ram is sometimes a formidable\r\nenemy, when he thinks any mischief is intended towards the flock of\r\nwhich he is the proud leader.\r\n\r\nOf the attachment of sheep to their native place, Captain Brown gives a\r\nvery remarkable instance. \"A ewe made a journey of nine days' length to\r\nreturn to her native place, with her lamb; and was tracked so\r\ncompletely, as to make her owners acquainted with her adventures.\r\nNothing turned her back, and whenever her lamb lagged behind, she urged\r\nhim on with her impatient bleating. When she reached Stirling, it was\r\nthe day of an annual fair, and she dared not venture into the crowd;\r\nshe, therefore, laid herself down by the road side, with her lamb,\r\noutside the town, and the next morning early, stole through the streets,\r\nonly terrified at the dogs which she encountered. She came to a\r\ntoll-bar, the keeper of which stopped her, supposing she was a stray\r\nanimal, and would shortly be claimed. She frequently tried to get\r\nthrough the gate, but was as often prevented, and she patiently turned\r\nback. At last she found some means of eluding the obstacle, for on the\r\nninth day she reached her destination with her lamb, where she was\r\nrepurchased, and remained till she died of old age in her seventeenth\r\nyear.\"\r\n\r\nSheep have been known, when seized with an epidemic disorder, to absent\r\nthemselves from the rest of the flock, and hide themselves; and many\r\ntouching stories are told of the artifices of necessity practised to\r\nwean them from their dead offspring, and make them adopt others; also of\r\nthe manner in which they remain and watch the inanimate objects of their\r\naffection.\r\n\r\nA gentleman travelling in a lonely part of the Highlands, received a\r\nstrong proof of sagacity in a ewe, who came piteously bleating to meet\r\nhim. When near, she redoubled her cries, and looked up in his face, as\r\nif to ask his assistance. He alighted from his gig, and followed her.\r\nShe led him to a cairn at a considerable distance from the road, where\r\nhe found a lamb, completely wedged in betwixt two large stones, and\r\nstruggling with its legs uppermost. He extricated the sufferer, and\r\nplaced it on the green sward; and the mother poured forth her thanks in\r\na long and continued bleat. (Capt. Brown's Pop. Nat. Hist.)\r\n\r\nThe following history was related by one of the shepherds to whom the\r\ncircumstance occurred. \"We were seven of us, grazing the sheep of a rich\r\nBulgarian, on the steppe of Atkeshoff, and had a flock of 2000 sheep,\r\nand 150 goats. It was the month of March, and they were just driven out;\r\nthe weather was mild, and the grass had appeared, but the wind was\r\nbitterly cold in the evening, and it began to rain. The rain soon turned\r\nto snow, and our wet cloaks were frozen as hard as boards. A few hours\r\nafter, came a Siberian _viuga_, or snowdrift, from the north-east,\r\nwhistling about our ears till seeing or hearing was impossible. We tried\r\nto find our way home, from which we were not far distant; but the sheep\r\nwould not face the wind, and even the goats, who will face anything but\r\na _viuga_, began to run before the storm. To prevent the flock from\r\nscampering away was impossible, and all that could be done was to keep\r\nthem together. We had to race all night, and in the morning there was\r\nnothing but snow all round us. The _viuga_ raged all that day, and the\r\npoor sheep were even more wild and frightened than in the night.\r\nSometimes we gave up all as lost, but roused ourselves again, and ran\r\nwith the screaming, bleating flock, while the oxen trotted after with\r\nthe wagon, and the dogs came howling behind. The poor goats were all\r\nlost, or frozen to death the first day, in which we ran at least fifty\r\nor sixty versts, leaving a track of dead sheep behind us. In the\r\nevening the poor beasts were less wild, being exhausted by hunger and\r\nfatigue. Two of our party reported themselves sick, and crept under the\r\nmats and skins in the wagon, and the rest had only time to take a\r\nlittle bread and snow to save life.\r\n\r\n\"Night came, no house was near, and this was worse than the preceding.\r\nThe storm was driving us upon the coast, and we expected to be blown\r\nwith our stupid cattle into the sea. Another shepherd fell sick, and we\r\nthought that night would have been the last for us all. In the morning\r\nthe wind shifted, and drove us towards some houses, which we saw through\r\nthe drifting snow, but though they were not more than thirty feet away,\r\nit was quite impossible to make the foolish sheep turn aside. On they\r\nwent before the wind, in spite of all we could do, and we soon lost\r\nsight of the houses. Their inhabitants, however, had heard the howling\r\nof the dogs, and about twenty came to our assistance. We then managed to\r\nturn the sheep, and drive them under sheds, and into houses. All the\r\ngoats and five hundred sheep were lost. Many died after they got under\r\nshelter, for in their fright, they crowded so close together, that they\r\nwere smothered. Half a verst farther, and we should have come to the\r\ncoast, rising twenty-five fathoms above the sea.\"\r\n\r\nThe above gives a lively picture of sufferings which are unknown to us,\r\nand in which the dogs seem to have been less efficacious than our own\r\nexcellent breed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOXEN.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe widely distributed genus Bos, has horns in both sexes, and in it we\r\nfind the largest of the Ruminantia. They, generally speaking, have\r\ncomparatively short legs, and heavy massive bodies. The perfection of\r\ndomestic oxen is said to be a resemblance to a box set upon four posts;\r\nbut in some of the wilder species, an arched back is certainly a beauty.\r\nTheir foreheads are very wide, and mostly flat; their ears large, and\r\nprojecting from the sides of the head; their muzzle broad, destitute of\r\nhair, and always moist. A long ridge passes across the top of the\r\nforehead, from which proceed two horns, more or less curved, sometimes\r\nof great length, always tapering to a point, and having a bony core.\r\nTheir neck is thick, and from it hangs a dewlap, which passes between\r\nthe fore legs. The hoofs are cleft.\r\n\r\nOf the origin of these Ruminants we know absolutely nothing, for they\r\nare spoken of as domesticated animals from the earliest times; and\r\nalthough there are such things as wild tribes now existing, we are not\r\nsure whether they were placed where they are with their present\r\ncharacters, or whether all are modifications of one pair, according to\r\ncircumstances. The most conspicuous among them are the Zebu, the\r\nBuffalo, the Bison, and the bulls of various parts of the Old World.\r\nThose cattle which roam about in a free state in South America, New\r\nZealand, and Australia, have not very long escaped from the dominion of\r\nman.\r\n\r\nIn India some of the heathen natives make a certain ox a sacred animal;\r\nthe Brahmins worship it; and it is a distinct variety from the common\r\nworking oxen, who are by no means treated kindly. The cherished sorts\r\nare very sleek and tame, and even voluntarily go up to strangers who\r\nhave grass in their hands, and eat it from them. They are, however,\r\ntroublesome, as all pets are, and no one will dare to check them, for\r\nthey must not be struck. Near Calcutta, they often break into gardens,\r\nput their noses into pastrycook's and fruiterer's shops, and have not\r\nthe least hesitation, when they are affronted, in going up to the\r\noffenders and giving them a poke with their horns.\r\n\r\nThe Zebus are spread over India, China, the Archipelago, Madagascar, and\r\nseveral parts of Africa. They are distinguished by a hump of fat between\r\ntheir shoulders, and they are as good for the saddle as for draught.\r\nThey are more active and agile than we can imagine them to be,\r\naccustomed as we are to the slow, heavy pace of others of the tribe;\r\nthey go with ease at the rate of six miles an hour, and travel for\r\nfifteen or sixteen hours in the day. Their paces are very agreeable,\r\nbeing wholly without the circular motion of the hind legs, which makes\r\nours so tiring to ride. They will go over a five-barred gate, as well as\r\nthe best hunter; are equally good for the plough, or for threshing corn,\r\nand the white are the most esteemed.\r\n\r\nThe Gayal affords the richest milk, and prefers feeding on trees. It\r\nalso comes from India; it is gentle even in its wild state, and runs\r\naway from, but never faces man.\r\n\r\nThe Gours are much more formidable than the preceding; and the Indians\r\nsay the tiger has no chance with them when full grown. They also eat\r\ntrees and grass, and will not live in captivity. They grow to an immense\r\nsize; their back is arched, and a very thick ridge rises upon it, which\r\nsubsides towards the tail.\r\n\r\nThe Yak has narrow nostrils, the ears small and pointed, the forehead\r\ncovered with black curling hair, that on the back is smooth, and of a\r\ndark brown or black colour, with one white stripe on the withers, and\r\nanother on the croup. The shoulders, sides, inside of thighs, and under\r\npart of the body, are covered with a mane of hair which almost reaches\r\nthe ground and is of a grizzled black with a central line of white along\r\nthe belly. The tail is a large mass of glossy, coarse hair; quite\r\nwhite, and from eighteen to twenty inches long. The horns are small,\r\npointed, and curve forwards. The animal is said to be very wild and\r\nmischievous; but it can be tamed. The tails were used by the Mongols and\r\nTartars as standards, and throughout the East are now fitted into ivory\r\nhandles, and form brushes for driving away the flies. The Yaks are\r\ndull-looking animals, and make a low, grunting noise, causing them to be\r\nknown in Europe as the grunting cow. They are very useful when\r\ndomesticated, and yield an abundance of milk. Not many years ago, they\r\nwere objects of mystery, and those who travelled to collect the\r\ncuriosities of nature, were ordered to ascertain their attributes,\r\nalmost their existence, the tails alone having reached Europe.\r\n\r\nBuffaloes are heavier and clumsier animals than the ox, and are covered\r\nwith coarser hair; they are very wild and savage, rush upon the tiger,\r\ncrush, and trample him to death. They delight in those steaming marshes\r\nwhich are pestilential to other beings, and wallow in stagnant water.\r\nTheir hide is particularly tough, their flesh hard, and their milk\r\ndelicious. They are sometimes trained to be very useful, especially\r\nwhere rivers are apt to be swollen; for they do not fear to breast any\r\ntorrent, however violent it may be in its course. They are spread over\r\nIndia, China, and various parts of Africa, have been introduced into\r\nSpain and Italy, and wherever they live, malaria is sure to exist. The\r\nCape Buffalo is said to be more than a match for the lion, who only\r\novercomes him by some cunning stratagem, or springs upon him when he is\r\ndrinking. If, however, others of the herd come to his assistance, the\r\nlion is either vanquished, or obliged to decamp.\r\n\r\nA herd consisting of seven wild buffaloes, with one calf, was discovered\r\nin Hindustan, and four gentlemen proceeded to hunt them. After having\r\nfollowed them for three miles, the young one separated from the herd and\r\njoined some tame cattle belonging to a neighbouring village. It was\r\nkilled by the party, who afterwards continued the pursuit of the old\r\nones, and they were overtaken in a high grass jungle four miles further\r\noff. They were quickly driven from this place, and closely followed for\r\nmore than six miles over a plain. At length the party succeeded in\r\nseparating one buffalo from the herd. Here the encounter began. After\r\nreceiving several wounds, he still continued his flight; he suddenly\r\nhalted, and kept his pursuers at bay; after a short interval he again\r\nfled, was pursued, and wounded as before, carrying the spears sticking\r\nin his back and sides for several hundred yards. Lieut. White of the\r\n15th N. I., rode up very close to him, threw his spear, and wounded the\r\nanimal in the loins. His horse being much exhausted, was unable to wheel\r\nround before the buffalo turned about and charged with such vigour,\r\nthat both horse and rider were overthrown, and lay many yards distant.\r\nFortunately the lieutenant received no injury, and when the animal\r\napproached, he had the presence of mind to lie flat on his back. The\r\nbeast approached, but stood at his feet without offering any violence.\r\nThe other sportsmen called repeatedly to their companion to arise and\r\nescape. For some time, however, he disregarded their advice, fearful of\r\nthe consequences. At length, in compliance with their entreaty, he\r\narose. The buffalo instantly rushed forward, but Mr. White escaped by\r\nagain throwing himself down; while the enraged beast, missing his aim,\r\nfell on the ground, his horns grazing Mr. White's back, as he passed\r\nover him. After this lucky escape, he seized the favourable opportunity,\r\nand regained his horse. The buffalo then took refuge in a tank; and when\r\nhis former opponent joined his companions, who were standing on the\r\nbank, the animal issued forth, and selecting Lieut. White for the object\r\nof his vengeance, pursued him to a considerable distance. The buffalo\r\nwas now rendered quite furious, and attacked every thing within his\r\nreach, such as cows and dogs. Unfortunately an old woman passed, and\r\nbecame the victim of his rage; she was taken up without any appearance\r\nof life, having her arms broken, and many wounds. The horsemen were too\r\nfatigued to renew the attack, and the buffaloes, having gained a\r\nvictory, continued their course without further molestation. (Capt.\r\nBrown's Pop. Nat. Hist.)\r\n\r\nMr. Pringle describes the Cape Buffalo to be \"a very formidable and\r\npowerful animal, considerably larger than the domestic ox; the bony pad\r\non his forehead making a complete helmet, and it is impossible to pierce\r\nhim with bullets which have not been hardened by tin. He is said to be\r\nfierce, treacherous, and savage, and even when not provoked, will attack\r\nany man who strays near his haunts; skulking in the jungle when he sees\r\nthen approach, and then suddenly rushing out upon them. If he kill a\r\nman, he stands over him for some time, trampling on him with his hoofs,\r\ncrushing him with his knees, mangling him with his horns, and stripping\r\noff his skin with his rough and prickly tongue. He goes away and returns\r\nagain and again, as if he could not sufficiently glut his vengeance.\r\n\r\n\"A party of boers had gone out to hunt a herd of buffaloes which were\r\ngrazing on a piece of marshy ground. As they could not get within shot\r\nof the game without crossing part of the marsh which was not safe for\r\nthe horses, they agreed to leave them in charge of the Hottentots, and\r\nadvance on foot, thinking that if any of the buffaloes should turn upon\r\nthem, it would be easy to escape by retreating across the quagmire,\r\nwhich, though passable for man, would not support the weight of a heavy\r\nquadruped. They advanced accordingly, and, under covert of the bushes,\r\napproached the game with such advantage, that the first volley brought\r\ndown three of the fattest of the herd, and so severely wounded the great\r\nbull leader, that he dropped on his knees, bellowing furiously. Thinking\r\nhim mortally wounded, the foremost of the huntsmen issued from the\r\ncovert, and began reloading his musket as he advanced, to give him a\r\nfinishing shot. But no sooner did the infuriated animal see his foe in\r\nfront of him, than he sprang up and rushed headlong upon him. The man,\r\nthrowing down his heavy gun, fled towards the quagmire, but the beast\r\nwas so close upon him, that he despaired of escaping in that direction,\r\nand turning suddenly round a clump of copse-wood, began to climb an old\r\nmimosa tree which stood at one side of it. The raging beast, however,\r\nwas too quick for him. Bounding forward with a roar, which my informant\r\ndescribed as being one of the most frightful sounds he ever heard, he\r\ncaught the unfortunate man with his terrible horns, just as he had\r\nnearly escaped his reach, and tossed him into the air with such force,\r\nthat the body fell dreadfully mangled into a cleft of the tree. The\r\nbuffalo ran round the tree once or twice, apparently looking for the\r\nman, until weakened with loss of blood, he again sank on his knees. The\r\nrest of the party, recovering from their confusion, then came up and\r\ndespatched him, though too late to save their comrade, whose body was\r\nhanging in the tree quite dead.\"\r\n\r\nThe Aurochs is the European Bison, and is one of the largest and noblest\r\nof the genus. He stands six feet high at the shoulders, has two sorts of\r\nhair, one short, soft, and woolly, and the other long, rough, and\r\ncovering the upper part and sides of the head; the chest, neck and\r\nshoulders, forming an enormous mane, sometimes a foot long. The tongue,\r\nlips and palate have a bluish tint, the eyes are small, and piercing; an\r\nodour resembling both musk and violets exudes from the skin, especially\r\nthat part which covers the convex forehead, and which may be smelt at a\r\ndistance of a hundred yards. Their flesh is much esteemed, they live in\r\nthickets near swamps, come out at night to eat the bark of young trees,\r\nlichens, and young shoots, carry their head low, are never completely\r\ntamed, detest the common bull, and their only attachment to human beings\r\nis bestowed on their keepers. They are now rare. A few are found in\r\nLithuanian Poland; but they used to inhabit all the European forests.\r\n\r\nThe American Bison, now familiarly called a Buffalo, exists in vast\r\nherds in the prairies of the New World. A _mob_ of them, as a herd is\r\ncalled, is irresistible; destroys everything over which it passes;\r\nnumbers hundreds of thousands, and rushes like a cataract over the\r\nplains, with a noise resembling that of thunder. They are very dangerous\r\nanimals to attack, hence the sport they afford is more exciting. For\r\ngraphic pictures of it, I would advise my readers to peruse the pages of\r\nMr. Catlin. They delight in salt springs and morasses; the bulls\r\nsometimes fight furiously with each other; their greatest enemy is the\r\ngrizzly bear, who frequently brings them down; and they have no antipathy\r\nto the common ox, like their European brethren. Mr. Bryan shot one; and\r\nthe bullet passed completely through him, almost cutting his heart in\r\ntwo, and yet he ran half a mile before he fell.\r\n\r\nThe Musk Oxen live in the high latitudes of North America, are very\r\nsmall, but look larger than they are, from the quantity of long, woolly\r\nhair with which they are covered, and which often reaches the ground.\r\nTheir flesh smells strongly of musk; and they are easily irritated. Some\r\nstockings made from their long fleece, have been said to equal those\r\nmanufactured with silk.\r\n\r\nThe Chillingham Park Cattle are very handsome, being white with red\r\nears, and black muzzle; their horns are also white with black tips, and\r\ngreatly resemble our Devonshire breed, which is thought to approach\r\nnearer than any other to the Welsh wild cattle of ancient times. They\r\nare fleet, bold, and active, hide their calves for the first week after\r\nthey are born, and are at all times dangerous to approach.\r\n\r\nLike the sheep, there are so many breeds of oxen in this country, that\r\nthe plan of my work cannot embrace them. They are a most important item\r\nin the riches of England; and few are insensible to the merits of our\r\ncheese and roast beef. We are not exactly on the same terms with our\r\noxen as the Swiss are with theirs, with whom they form a part of the\r\nfamily, and where they are adorned with gay trappings and expensive\r\nbells; but our cows are familiar friends, coming when they are called,\r\nof themselves returning to the farm at milking time, and evincing great\r\naffection. I have not seen it stated elsewhere; but I have been told\r\nmany times, that it is necessary to milk the cow always on the same\r\nside, or she kicks and rebels. Our bulls are sometimes fierce, but are\r\nmuch under the influence of voice and gesture. Both sexes will give\r\nnotice of approaching rain after a drought, and are very inquisitive.\r\n\r\nMr. Bell gives us the following anecdote which was witnessed by one of\r\nhis near relatives:--\"A cow which was feeding tranquilly in a pasture,\r\nthe gate of which was open to the road, was much annoyed by a\r\nmischievous boy, who amused himself by throwing stones at the peaceful\r\nanimal; who, after bearing with his impertinence for some time, at\r\nlength went up to him, hooked the end of her horn into his clothes, and\r\nlifting him from the ground, carried him out of the field, and laid him\r\ndown in the road. She then calmly returned to her pasture, leaving him\r\nquit with a severe fright and a torn garment.\"\r\n\r\nIn Mr. Byam's \"Central America\" I find this interesting history, with\r\nwhich I conclude the present series of anecdotes:--\"A bull had gored so\r\nmany cattle that he was lassoed, and his horns blunted at the tips, to\r\nprevent further mischief. A few weeks after, a panther (jaguar) killed a\r\ncow, and from the torn condition of the bull's head and neck, and the\r\ntrampled state of the ground, he had evidently done battle for the cow.\r\nHe was secured, his wounds plastered up, his horns made sharp again,\r\nand turned out into the Savannah. The wild dogs and vultures having been\r\nkept from the body of the cow during the day, the panther returned to\r\nhis feast at night, and a furious engagement took place between him and\r\nthe bull; for the former was found dead, close by the cow, the next\r\nmorning, pierced through and through. The bull returned again and again\r\nto him with fury, and was himself again wounded; but his gashes were\r\nsown up, and he remained so fierce, that his horns were obliged to be\r\nre-blunted.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE END.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nJ.
