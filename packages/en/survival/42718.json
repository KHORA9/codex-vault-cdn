LANTZ, _Assistant Biologist_.\r\n\r\n\r\n    NOTE.--This bulletin describes the habits, geographic\r\n    distribution, and methods of destroying meadow mice and pine mice,\r\n    and discusses the value of protecting their natural enemies among\r\n    mammals, birds, and reptiles. It is for general distribution.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe ravages of short-tailed field mice in many parts of the United\r\nStates result in serious losses to farmers, orchardists, and those\r\nconcerned with the conservation of our forests, and the problem of\r\ncontrolling the animals is one of considerable importance.\r\n\r\nShort-tailed field mice are commonly known as meadow mice, pine mice,\r\nand voles; locally as bear mice, buck-tailed mice, or black mice.\r\nThe term includes a large number of closely related species widely\r\ndistributed in the Northern Hemisphere. Over 50 species and races occur\r\nwithin the United States and nearly 40 other forms have been described\r\nfrom North America. Old World forms are fully as numerous. For the\r\npurposes of this paper no attempt at classification is required, but\r\ntwo general groups will be considered under the names meadow mice and\r\npine mice. These two groups have well-marked differences in habits,\r\nand both are serious pests wherever they inhabit regions of cultivated\r\ncrops. Under the term \"meadow mice\"[1] are included the many species of\r\nvoles that live chiefly in surface runways and build both subterranean\r\nand surface nests. Under the term \"pine mice\"[2] are included a few\r\nforms that, like moles, live almost wholly in underground burrows. Pine\r\nmice may readily be distinguished from meadow mice by their shorter and\r\nsmoother fur, their red-brown color, and their molelike habits. (See\r\nfig. 1.)\r\n\r\n[1] Genus _Microtus_.\r\n\r\n[2] Genus _Pitymys_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1.--Field mice: _a_, Meadow mouse; _b_, pine mouse.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMEADOW MICE.\r\n\r\n\r\nMeadow mice inhabit practically the whole of the Northern Hemisphere--\r\nAmerica, north of the Tropics; all of Europe, except Ireland; and\r\nAsia, except the southern part. In North America there are few wide\r\nareas except arid deserts free from meadow mice, and in most of the\r\nUnited States they have at times been numerous and harmful. The animals\r\nare very prolific, breeding several times a season and producing\r\nlitters of from 6 to 10. Under favoring circumstances, not well\r\nunderstood, they sometimes produce abnormally and become a menace to\r\nall growing crops. Plagues of meadow mice have often been mentioned\r\nin the history of the Old World, and even within the United States\r\nmany instances are recorded of their extraordinary abundance with\r\naccompanying destruction of vegetation.\r\n\r\nThe runs of meadow mice are mainly on the surface of the ground under\r\ngrass, leaves, weeds, brush, boards, snow, or other sheltering litter.\r\nThey are hollowed out by the animals' claws, and worn hard and smooth\r\nby being frequently traversed. They are extensive, much branched, and\r\nmay readily be found by parting the grass or removing the litter. The\r\nruns lead to shallow burrows where large nests of dead grass furnish\r\nwinter retreats for the mice. Summer nests are large balls of the same\r\nmaterial hidden in the grass and often elevated on small hummocks in\r\nthe meadows and marshes where the animals abound. The young are brought\r\nforth in either underground or surface nests.\r\n\r\nMeadow mice are injurious to most crops. They destroy grass in\r\nmeadows and pastures; cut down grain, clover, and alfalfa; eat grain\r\nleft standing in shocks; injure seeds, bulbs, flowers, and garden\r\nvegetables; and are especially harmful to trees and shrubbery. The\r\nextent of their depredations is usually in proportion to their numbers.\r\nThus, in the lower Humboldt Valley, Nevada, during two winters (1906-8)\r\nthese mice were abnormally abundant, and totally ruined the alfalfa,\r\ndestroying both stems and roots on about 18,000 acres and entailing a\r\nloss estimated at fully $250,000.\r\n\r\nWhen present even in ordinary numbers meadow mice cause serious\r\ninjury to orchards and nurseries. Their attacks on trees are often\r\nmade in winter under cover of snow, but they may occur at any season\r\nunder shelter of growing vegetation or dry litter. The animals have\r\nbeen known almost totally to destroy large nurseries of young apple\r\ntrees. It was stated that during the winter of 1901-2 nurserymen near\r\nRochester, N. Y., sustained losses from these mice amounting to fully\r\n$100,000.\r\n\r\nOlder orchard trees sometimes are killed by meadow mice. In Kansas in\r\n1903 the writer saw hundreds of apple trees, 8 to 10 years planted, and\r\n4 to 6 inches in diameter, completely girdled by these pests. (Fig.\r\n2.) The list of cultivated trees and shrubs injured by these animals\r\nincludes nearly all those grown by the horticulturist. The Biological\r\nSurvey has received complaints of the destruction of apple, pear,\r\npeach, plum, quince, cherry, and crab-apple trees, of blackberry,\r\nraspberry, rose, currant, and barberry bushes, and of grape vines; also\r\nof the injury of sugar maple, black locust, Osage orange, sassafras,\r\npine, alder, white ash, mountain ash, oak, cottonwood, willow, wild\r\ncherry, and other forest trees.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 2.--Apple tree killed by meadow mice.]\r\n\r\nIn the Arnold Arboretum, near Boston, Mass., during the winter of\r\n1903-4, meadow mice destroyed thousands of trees and shrubs, including\r\napple, juniper, blueberry, sumac, maple, barberry, buckthorn, dwarf\r\ncherry, snowball, bush honeysuckle, dogwood, beech, and larch. Plants\r\nin nursery beds and acorns and cuttings in boxes were especial objects\r\nof attack.\r\n\r\nThe injury to trees and shrubs consists in the destruction of the bark\r\njust at the surface of the ground and in some instances for several\r\ninches above or below. When the girdling is complete and the cambium\r\nentirely eaten through, the action of sun and wind soon completes the\r\ndestruction of the tree. If the injury is not too extensive prompt\r\ncovering of the wounds will usually save the tree. In any case of\r\ngirdling heaping up fresh soil about the trunk so as to cover the\r\nwounds and prevent evaporation is recommended as the simplest remedy.\r\nTo save large and valuable trees bridge grafting may be employed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPINE MICE.\r\n\r\n\r\nPine mice occur over the greater part of eastern United States from\r\nthe Hudson River Valley to eastern Kansas and Nebraska and from the\r\nGreat Lakes to the Gulf of Mexico. Inhabitants chiefly of forested\r\nregions, they are unknown on the open plains. Ordinarily they live in\r\nthe woods, but are partial also to old pastures or lands not frequently\r\ncultivated. From woods, hedges, and fence rows they spread into\r\ngardens, lawns, and cultivated fields through their own underground\r\ntunnels or those of the garden mole. The tunnels made by pine mice\r\ncan be distinguished from those made by moles only by their smaller\r\ndiameter and the frequent holes that open to the surface.\r\n\r\nWhile the mole feeds almost wholly upon insects and earthworms, and\r\nseldom eats vegetable substances, pine mice are true rodents and live\r\nupon seeds, roots, and leaves. Their harmful activities include the\r\ndestruction of potatoes, sweet potatoes, ginseng roots, bulbs in lawns,\r\nshrubbery, and trees. They destroy many fruit trees in upland orchards\r\nand nurseries (fig. 3). The mischief they do is not usually discovered\r\nuntil later, when harvest reveals the rifled potato hills or when\r\nleaves of plants or trees suddenly wither. In many instances the injury\r\nis wrongly attributed to moles whose tunnels invade the place or extend\r\nfrom hill to hill of potatoes. The mole is seeking earthworms or white\r\ngrubs that feed upon the tubers, but mice that follow in the runs eat\r\nthe potatoes themselves.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 3.--Root and trunk of apple tree from Laurel, Md.,\r\ngnawed by pine mice.]\r\n\r\nPine mice feed to some extent outside their burrows, reaching the\r\nsurface through the small openings made at frequent intervals in the\r\nroofs of the tunnels. In their forays they rarely go more than a few\r\nfeet from these holes. Most of their food is carried under ground,\r\nwhere much is stored for future consumption. While they differ little\r\nfrom meadow mice in general food habits, their surroundings afford them\r\na larger proportion of mast. They are less prolific than meadow mice,\r\nbut this is more than made up for in the fact that in their underground\r\nlife they are less exposed to their enemies among birds and mammals.\r\nLike meadow mice, they sometimes become abnormally abundant.\r\n\r\nIn the eastern part of the United States pine mice do more damage to\r\norchards than do meadow mice, partly because their work is undiscovered\r\nuntil trees begin to die. The runs of meadow mice under grass or leaves\r\nare easily found and the injury they do to trees is always visible.\r\nOn the other hand, depredations by pine mice can be found only after\r\ndigging about the tree and exposing the trunk below the surface.\r\nThe roots of small trees are often entirely eaten off by pine mice,\r\nand pine trees as well as deciduous forest trees, when young, are\r\nfrequently killed by these animals (fig. 4).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 4.--Pine tree killed by pine mice.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDESTROYING FIELD MICE.\r\n\r\n\r\nMethods of destroying field mice or holding them in check by trapping\r\nand poisoning are equally applicable to meadow mice and pine mice.\r\n\r\n\r\nTRAPPING.\r\n\r\nIf mice are present in small numbers, as is often the case in lawns,\r\ngardens, or seed beds, they may readily be caught in strong mouse traps\r\nof the guillotine type (figs. 5 and 6). These should be baited with\r\noatmeal or other grain, or may be set in the mouse runs without bait.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 5.--Field mouse caught in baited guillotine trap.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 6.--Field mouse caught in unbaited guillotine trap.]\r\n\r\nTrapping has special advantages for small areas where a limited number\r\nof mice are present, but it is also adapted to large areas whenever\r\nit is undesirable to lay out poison. It is then necessary to use many\r\ntraps and continue their use for several weeks. If mice are moderately\r\nabundant, from 12 to 20 traps per acre maybe used to advantage. These\r\nshould soon make decided inroads on the numbers of mice in an orchard\r\nif not practically to exterminate them. For pine mice the tunnels\r\nshould be excavated sufficiently to admit the trap on a level with the\r\nbottom. A light garden trowel may be used for the necessary digging.\r\n\r\n\r\nPOISONING.\r\n\r\nOn large areas where mice are abundant, poisoning is the quickest means\r\nof destroying them, and even on small areas it has decided advantages\r\nover trapping.\r\n\r\nThe following formula is recommended:\r\n\r\n_Dry grain formula._--Mix thoroughly 1 ounce powdered strychnine\r\n(alkaloid), 1 ounce powdered bicarbonate of soda, and 1/8 ounce (or\r\nless) of saccharine. Put the mixture in a tin pepper box and sift it\r\ngradually over 50 pounds of crushed wheat or 40 pounds of crushed oats\r\nin a metal tub, mixing the grain constantly so that the poison will be\r\nevenly distributed.\r\n\r\nDry mixing, as above described, has the advantage that the grain may\r\nbe kept any length of time without fermentation. If it is desired to\r\nmoisten the grain to facilitate thorough mixing, it would be well to\r\nuse a thin starch paste (as described below, but without strychnine)\r\nbefore applying the poison. The starch soon hardens and fermentation is\r\nnot likely to follow.\r\n\r\nIf crushed oats or wheat can not be obtained, whole oats may be used,\r\nbut they should be of good quality. As mice hull the oats before eating\r\nthem, it is desirable to have the poison penetrate the kernels. A very\r\nthin starch paste is recommended as a medium for applying poison to the\r\ngrain. Prepare as follows:\r\n\r\n_Wet grain formula._--Dissolve 1 ounce of strychnia sulphate in 2\r\nquarts of boiling water. Dissolve 2 tablespoonfuls of laundry starch\r\nin 1/2 pint of cold water. Add the starch to the strychnine solution\r\nand boil for a few minutes until the starch is clear. A little\r\nsaccharine may be added if desired, but it is not essential. Pour the\r\nhot starch over 1 bushel of oats in a metal tub and stir thoroughly.\r\nLet the grain stand overnight to absorb the poison.\r\n\r\nThe poisoned grain prepared by either of the above formulas is to be\r\ndistributed over the infested area, not more than a teaspoonful at a\r\nplace, care being taken to put it in mouse runs and at the entrances\r\nof burrows. To avoid destroying birds it should whenever possible be\r\nplaced under such shelters as piles of weeds, straw, brush, or other\r\nlitter, or under boards. Small drain tiles, 1 1/2 inches in diameter,\r\nhave sometimes been used to advantage to hold poisoned grain, but\r\nold tin cans with the edges bent nearly together will serve the same\r\npurpose.\r\n\r\nChopped alfalfa hay poisoned with strychnine was successfully used\r\nto destroy meadow mice in Nevada during the serious outbreak of the\r\nanimals in 1907-8. One ounce of strychnia sulphate dissolved in 2\r\ngallons of hot water was found sufficient to poison 30 pounds of\r\nchopped alfalfa previously moistened with water. This bait, distributed\r\nin small quantities at a place, was very effective against the mice,\r\nand birds were not endangered in its distribution.\r\n\r\nFor poisoning mice in small areas, as lawns, gardens, seed beds,\r\nvegetable pits, and the like, a convenient bait is ordinary rolled\r\noats. This may be prepared as follows: Dissolve 1/16 ounce of\r\nstrychnine in 1 pint of boiling water and pour it over as much oatmeal\r\n(about 2 pounds) as it will wet. Mix until all the grain is moistened.\r\nPut it out, a teaspoonful at a place, under shelter of weed and brush\r\npiles or wide boards.\r\n\r\nThe above poisons are adapted to killing pine mice, but sweet potatoes\r\ncut into small pieces have proved even more effective. They keep well\r\nin contact with soil except when there is danger of freezing, and are\r\nreadily eaten by the mice. The baits should be prepared as follows:\r\n\r\n_Potato formula._--Cut sweet potatoes into pieces about as large as\r\ngood-sized grapes. Place them in a metal pan or tub and wet them with\r\nwater. Drain off the water and with a tin pepper box slowly sift over\r\nthem powdered strychnine (alkaloid preferred), stirring constantly so\r\nthat the poison is evenly distributed. An ounce of strychnine should\r\npoison a bushel of the cut bait.\r\n\r\nThe bait, whether of grain or pieces of potato, may be dropped into\r\nthe pine-mouse tunnels through the natural openings or through holes\r\nmade with a piece of broom handle or other stick. Bird life will not be\r\nendangered by these baits.\r\n\r\n\r\nCULTIVATING THE LAND.\r\n\r\nThorough cultivation of fields and the elimination of fence rows\r\nbetween them is the most effective protection against field mice.\r\nCultivation destroys weeds and all the annual growths that serve as\r\nshelter for the animals. This applies equally well to orchards and\r\nnurseries. Clean tillage and the removal from adjoining areas of the\r\nweeds and grass that provide hiding places for mice will always secure\r\nimmunity to trees from attacks of the animals.\r\n\r\n\r\nPROTECTING NATURAL ENEMIES OF MICE.\r\n\r\nField mice are the prey of many species of mammals, birds, and\r\nreptiles. Unfortunately, the relation that exists between the\r\nnumbers of rodents and the numbers of their enemies is not generally\r\nappreciated; otherwise the public would exercise more discrimination\r\nin its warfare against carnivorous animals. It is the persistent\r\ndestruction of these, the beneficial and harmful alike, that has\r\nbrought about the present condition of growing scarcity of predacious\r\nmammals and birds and corresponding increase of rodent pests of the\r\nfarm, especially rats and mice. The relation between effect and cause\r\nis obvious.\r\n\r\nAmong the mammalian enemies of meadow and pine mice are coyotes,\r\nwildcats, foxes, badgers, raccoons, opossums, skunks, weasels, shrews,\r\nand the domestic cat and dog. Among birds, their enemies include nearly\r\nall the hawks and owls, storks, ibises, herons, cranes, gulls, shrikes,\r\ncuckoos, and crows. Among their reptilian foes are black snakes and\r\nbull snakes. Not all these destroyers of mice are more beneficial than\r\nharmful, but the majority are, and warfare against them should be\r\nlimited to the minority that are more noxious than useful.\r\n\r\n\r\nOWLS AND FIELD MICE.\r\n\r\nOwls as destroyers of mice are deserving of special mention. Not one of\r\nour American owls, unless it be the great horned owl, is to be classed\r\nas noxious. Especially beneficial are the short-eared, long-eared,\r\nscreech, and barn owls. All these prey largely upon field mice, and\r\nseldom harm birds. Unfortunately, the short-eared and barn owls, which\r\nare the more useful species, are not plentiful in the sections most\r\nseriously infested by field mice.\r\n\r\nThe short-eared owl, while widely distributed, is not abundant, except\r\nlocally, within the United States, but wherever field mice become\r\nexcessively numerous these owls usually assemble in considerable\r\nnumbers to prey upon them. Examinations of stomachs of these owls show\r\nthat fully three-fourths of their food consists of short-tailed field\r\nmice.\r\n\r\nThe barn owl is rather common in the southern half of the United States\r\nand breeds as far north as the forty-first parallel of latitude. That\r\nmice form the chief diet of this bird has been demonstrated by Dr. A.\r\nK. Fisher, of the Biological Survey, through examination of stomachs\r\nof many barn owls and also of large numbers of pellets (castings from\r\ntheir stomachs) found under their roosts. In 1,247 barn-owl pellets\r\ncollected in the towers of the Smithsonian Building in Washington,\r\nD. C., he found 1,991 skulls of short-tailed field mice, 656 of the\r\nhouse mouse, 210 of the common rat, and 147 of other small rodents and\r\nshrews. Very few remains of birds were found. Figure 7 illustrates the\r\ncontents of some of these pellets.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 7.--Field-mouse skulls taken from pellets\r\nfound under owl roost in Smithsonian tower, Washington, D. C.]\r\n\r\nIn 360 pellets of the long-eared owl Dr. Fisher found skulls of 374\r\nsmall mammals, of which 349 were meadow mice. Stomach examinations give\r\nsimilar testimony to the usefulness of this bird.\r\n\r\nThe common screech owl, in addition to feeding mainly upon mice,\r\ndestroys also a good many English sparrows. Its habit of staying in\r\norchards and close to farm buildings makes it especially useful to the\r\nfarmer in keeping his premises free from both house and field mice.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            WASHINGTON: GOVERNMENT PRINTING OFFICE: 1915\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's Field Mice as Farm and Orchard Pests, by D.
