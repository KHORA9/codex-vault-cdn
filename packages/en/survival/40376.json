STECHER\r\n\r\n  _Illustrated_\r\n\r\n\r\n  [Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n  NEW YORK\r\n  D. VAN NOSTRAND COMPANY\r\n  25 PARK PLACE\r\n  1914\r\n\r\n\r\n  COPYRIGHT, 1914, BY\r\n  D. VAN NOSTRAND COMPANY\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE\r\n\r\n\r\nThis monograph is not an attempt to put before the reading public a\r\nscientific exposition of the merits and qualities of the Quercus Suber\r\nor Quercus Liber (Linnæus), and carry it up into the heights of learning\r\nwhere none but the learned may go; but to set forth in as concise a\r\nmanner as possible, the plain story of the corkwood stopper so well\r\nknown to all. The corkwood as seen in the stopper and in many other\r\narticles of trade, has long been of service to man, and remained\r\nunnoticed in journals of science, but for a word here and there—and in\r\ntrying to acquaint myself with its generalities, found it most difficult\r\nto get even these. This rather impressed me as being singular, a\r\nmaterial so largely used and so little to its credit, in literature,\r\nthat I pressed my investigations only to find that the farther I\r\nsearched the less I found.\r\n\r\nThe few facts gleaned were of interest, and it occurred to me to put\r\nthem together in some readable form, for future reference. But as I\r\nreflected upon the unsuccessful attempt to get information, which was\r\nmade in behalf of my studies, I promptly decided to go into the subject\r\ndeep enough to cover all the facts and the result is this\r\nmonograph—Quercus Suber—\r\n\r\nIt is presented with the hope that it will help others who seek a\r\nknowledge of corkwood and is only intended as a résumé of a very\r\ninteresting subject. I have endeavored to give credit to those to whom\r\nit is due and offer my results as a tribute to a material that stands in\r\na class worthy of the scientists’ as well as the commercialists’ esteem.\r\n\r\n  G.

The years of its use have\r\ngiven very little knowledge of it to us, the reason perhaps being the\r\nlack of competition and therefore no necessity for a close scrutiny to\r\nfind additional qualities to recommend it above others. And an\r\nadditional mystery is that it has been in use for so many years and so\r\nlittle said about it. Its latent qualities have mystified those who have\r\nhandled it for years, and from them we can learn very little; so it will\r\nbe of interest to peruse practically all that has been written,\r\nincorporated in this treatise, with the addition of the latest\r\ninvestigations upon the subject. To present this in a form which will\r\ngive credit to the small but authoritative references and place them in\r\ntheir proper order, together with other recent data, was no small task,\r\nand in presenting the total matter in concise style meant the weeding\r\nout of all extraneous language or superfluous description.\r\n\r\nIn considering this material, it may be well to start with a few\r\nprecursory remarks as to the etymology of the words by which it has been\r\ndesignated in the past and is now known, as by so doing it will convey a\r\nbetter understanding of the material to follow.\r\n\r\n\r\nQUERCUS LIBER (Linnæus)\r\n\r\nThe above name is the true one of the material under discussion and is\r\nderived from the Latin. Quercus; Italian or esculent oak sacred to\r\nJupiter. Liber; binding or surrounding; hence surrounding of the oak or\r\nbark of the oak, sacred to Jupiter.\r\n\r\n\r\n“QUERCUS SUBER”\r\n\r\nThis, its definite name, undoubtedly conveyed some particular meaning to\r\nthe ancients, but research fails to reveal any definition of the word\r\n“Suber.”[1] “The word is so far a puzzle to philologists. Forcellini in\r\nhis great dictionary of Latin says that it is perhaps connected with the\r\nGreek word (συφαρ = suphar), which means ‘an old wrinkled skin, as, for\r\ninstance, the cast-off skin of a snake.’ If this derivation be sound,\r\nthe Romans, in using the word, thought at the outset primarily of the\r\nrough bark of the tree and then of the tree as a whole. Forcellini\r\nquotes also an opinion of Isidorus Hispalensis upon the longer form of\r\n‘Suber,’ i.e., Suberies, to the effect that this form is derived from\r\n‘sus’ (swine) and ‘edo’ (eat) because swine eat the acorns. But this is\r\na purely popular etymology. I find too that Scaliger derived it from the\r\nverb ‘Subio’ ‘to come up from below’ because cork will not stay down in\r\nwater. Vaniçek, in his Etymologisches Wörterbuch, classes ‘Suber’ among\r\nthe dunkel words, and in the new and most elaborate Historische\r\nGrammatic of Stolz the word is not mentioned at all in the treatment of\r\nroots. Even Otto Keller in his work on Etymologies has nothing to say\r\nabout it.”\r\n\r\n  [1] Letter from Prof. Nelson G. McCrea of Columbia University, June\r\n      12, 1910, to writer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“CORK”\r\n\r\n\r\nThis name is as much of a mystery as the word “Suber” and its origin can\r\nonly be guesswork. In the opinion of the writer it is the broadening of\r\nthe first syllable of the word “Quercus” and has no bearing upon its\r\nusage, composition or lineage. Some dictionaries give other derivations,\r\nsuch as the mutilation of the Spanish “Corcho” or the French “Calk,” and\r\nothers that it is taken from the Latin Cortex,[2] meaning the outer\r\nshell or husk, the external part, but they do not present any convincing\r\nargument.\r\n\r\n  [2] According to “Spanish Dictionary” of Lopes et Bensley; Cortex: “La\r\n      Parte exterior del Arbol.” Arbol in botany meaning “a tree.”\r\n\r\nThe meaning of the word “cork” as applied to-day is derived from the\r\nArabic “Kalafa,” to stop the seams of ships; the Latin “Stipo,” to\r\nsuppress; the French, “Calfeutrer,” to stop. But these do not bear upon\r\nthe origin of the word “cork,” as in all probability the word was coined\r\nindependent of these sources, but as we apply the word to a definite\r\nact, that of “stopping,” the definition as given above is applicable,\r\nalthough the proper name would be “stopper,” regardless of what material\r\nit is made. It is therefore plain that the word “cork” is a Latin\r\nphonetic abbreviation, for it appears to be the only logical root for\r\nthe word.\r\n\r\nThe cork tree is called “Alcornoque” in Castilian language; Surn in\r\nCastalan; Sobreiro, Gallician; Suvi y Sioure in provincialism; Chêne\r\nLiège in French; Keonge fernam or only fernam, in Argeline; Kork-baum or\r\nKorkeiche in German; and, as before stated, cork in English.[3]\r\n\r\n  [3] Consul Schenck’s Report.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nORIGIN\r\n\r\n\r\nThe study of its origin leads us to that romantic part of the world\r\nbordering the Mediterranean Sea from which we have already received so\r\nmuch in all branches. The cork-producing country practically covering\r\nthe whole of Portugal sweeping toward the East through the southern\r\ndistricts known as Andalusia and Estremadura, thence northeast,\r\nembracing thousands of acres of forests in Catalonia. Spain and Portugal\r\ndividing honors among the nations in the annual yield of raw material,\r\nwith perhaps the advantage leaning slightly to the latter.[4] This being\r\npartly due to increased area, no doubt, as the geographical situation is\r\nthe same but with the irrigation feature slightly in favor of Spain, as\r\nthrough the corkwood country flows the Guadalquivir River in addition to\r\nthe three which also pass through Portugal, consisting of the Douro,\r\nTagus and Guadiana in the west, and the Ebro in the Gerona district.\r\n\r\n  [4] Armstrong Cork Co.’s pamphlet.\r\n\r\nTunis and Algeria[5] rank next in importance with Southern France,\r\nincluding Corsica following closely. Italy (Tuscany) too with the help\r\nof Sardinia and Sicily continuing to be quite a factor in meeting the\r\ndemand for the crude material, while across the Strait of Gibraltar the\r\nsun-scorched forests of Morocco at El-araish are as yet undeveloped,\r\nalthough rapidly being pressed into service.\r\n\r\n  [5] There are large forests of cork on the French Colony of Algeria,\r\n      particularly on an estate granted by the Emperor Napoleon III to\r\n      M. le duc de Montebello.—H. G. GLASSPOOLE.\r\n\r\nThe geographical formation of Portugal is extremely favorable for the\r\nrearing of cork trees, every evidence of this characteristic being well\r\nmarked by the densely thick groups of cork trees to be seen in certain\r\nregions, especially in the Valley of the Tagus and the Sierra de\r\nPortalegre provinces of Alemtejo and Algarve, which are the chief\r\nbearing centers of this country,[6] the area devoted to their\r\ncultivation being approximately 366,000 hectares.\r\n\r\n  [6] Chambers Journal.\r\n\r\nIn Spain it is found in the Provinces of Gerona, Caceres, Andalusia,\r\nHuelvas, Seville, Cadiz, Ciudad Real, Malaga, Cordoba and Toledo in the\r\norder named.\r\n\r\nAccording to a calculation made by the administration of forests the\r\nextent of cork forests in Spain is about 255,000 hectares,[7] viz.\r\n80,000 in the Province of Gerona, 54,000 in Huelvas, 32,500 in Caceres,\r\n28,000 in Seville, 20,000 in Cadiz, 11,500 in Ciudad Real and 9500 in\r\nCordoba. The remainder is distributed between ten other provinces.[8]\r\n\r\n  [7] One hectare = 2.471 acres.\r\n\r\n  [8] Consul Schenck’s Report.\r\n\r\nIn the Province of Gerona is included a large territory stretching\r\nnorthward towards the Pyrenees to the Valley of the Muge and Ter. In\r\nFrance, according to Consul Goldschmidt of Nantes, the cork-producing\r\nterritory is divided as follows: Var, 280 acres; Lot-et-Garonne, 27\r\nacres; Landes, 32 acres; Corsica, 40 acres; making about 379 acres in\r\nall.\r\n\r\nThis résumé of the cork-producing countries of Europe will convey some\r\nidea of the extent of the forests, and will also show the climate sort\r\nby the tree; for it is proven that it flourishes best in an altitude of\r\n1600 to 3000 feet, in an average mean temperature of 55° Fahrenheit; and\r\nat points beyond 45° north latitude its successful propagation is\r\ndoubtful.\r\n\r\nThe Mediterranean Basin is particularly suitable for the rearing of\r\ncorkwood, and although many attempts have been made to transplant the\r\nseed, the results have proven fatal.\r\n\r\nNotable among these attempts being the American ambition to introduce\r\nthe tree in the United States. Portuguese acorns were brought to Wayne\r\nCounty, Mississippi, and planted in 1859; the result, as far as the\r\ngrowth was concerned, was splendid; but after a wait of eleven years,\r\nthe final crop was not a commercial success. Another attempt was made in\r\n1872, in southern California, but with no better outcome than the first,\r\nin which some of the trees attained to a height of thirteen feet (3.965\r\nmeters) and the stem, to a diameter of eleven inches (2.794 decimeters),\r\nincluding the cork, which attained a thickness of one inch (2.540\r\ncentimeters). This evidently rapid growth would infer that the American\r\nzone was all that could be desired for the favorable rearing of cork\r\ntrees; but strange to say this was not the case. Although the growth of\r\nthe tree had been exceptionally strong, the quality of its salient\r\nproduct turned out to be of an inferior character. The cork generally\r\nimproves with the age of the tree; in this instance, however, even after\r\nyears of maturity the cork harvest did not improve to any great extent,\r\nand indeed is still of a second-rate quality.[9] And Consul S. C. Reat,\r\nwriting from Tamsui, recently reports the efforts of the Japanese\r\nGovernment to plant cork trees in Formosa and the Ogasawara Isles, in\r\nthe endeavor to supply small corks to the Japanese merchants, the result\r\nof which, is yet to be learned.\r\n\r\n  [9] _Chambers Journal._\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE TREE AND GROWTH\r\n\r\nMany botanists consider the cork oak of Europe as belonging to two\r\nspecies, one chiefly characterized by annual fructification and the\r\npersistence of the leaves for two or three years (Quercus Suber,\r\nLinnæus); the other by biennial fructification and annual persistence of\r\nthe leaves (Quercus Occidentalis, Gay).[10]\r\n\r\n  [10] _Garden and Forest_, Vol. VIII, 52.\r\n\r\nIn the French departments of the Landes and Gironde the Quercus\r\nOccidentalis forms extensive woods, as also in Spain, Algeria and\r\nin some parts of Italy, while the Quercus Suber is a native of the\r\nAtlantic side of France and Portugal, where this tree grows to the\r\ngreatest perfection, and to which countries we are indebted for the\r\nmajor part of our supply. The cork tree bears a general resemblance to\r\nthe broad-leaved kind of (Quercus Ilex, Holm) or evergreen oak, of which\r\nspecies some authors consider it only a variety; but when full grown it\r\nforms a much handsomer tree.\r\n\r\n“In the localities to the north the cork is better than those exposed to\r\nthe south. It grows and develops in ground of very little depth, and\r\nsometimes in ground, in appearance very stony. It is seldom found in\r\ncalcareous soil, preferring always a soil of feldspar, and like the\r\nchestnut flourishes best in a sandy one.”[11]\r\n\r\n  [11] Consul Schenck’s Report.\r\n\r\nThe cork-oak attains a height of from six to eighteen meters, at times\r\nreaching fifty meters[12] and measures as much as 1.22 meters in\r\ndiameter.[13] Its branches are covered with small evergreen leaves,\r\nwhich are rather spongy and velvety to the touch, have a glossy\r\nappearance and a saw-tooth edge, measuring about three to five\r\ncentimeters[14] long and one and one-half to two wide. The roots are\r\nstrong and spread considerably, and frequently are to be seen on the\r\nsurface of the ground. The flowers or blossoms make their appearance in\r\nMay; the fruit ripens in the fall or winter, from September to January,\r\nand falling from the tree as soon as ripe. Three qualities of acorns are\r\nto be observed according to their time of ripening and are called,\r\n“brevas primerizas de San Miguel,” which ripen in September; the second\r\nor middling “Martinencas,” which ripen in October and November; and\r\nfinally the “tardias Ó palo-Meras,” which ripen in December and January.\r\nThese acorns form one of the forest’s chief sources of revenue, since\r\nfed to swine, they give a peculiarly piquant flavor to the meat, Spanish\r\nmountain hams being noted for their excellence.[15]\r\n\r\n  [12] Meter = 3.28 feet.\r\n\r\n  [13] In a cork-wood of Montenegro (municipal district of Quart,\r\n       Province of Gerona) the property of D. Romulo Bosch, and near the\r\n       place called La Mina, we measured in August, 1877, a tree that\r\n       was 4.95 meters in circumference, breast high, and the trunk of\r\n       the tree five meters high, calculating its age between one\r\n       hundred and fifty and two hundred years old. Consul Schenck’s\r\n       Report, 1890.\r\n\r\n  [14] Centimeter = .3937 inch.\r\n\r\n  [15] Consul Schenck’s Report, 1890. Authority M. Fee.\r\n\r\nIn the following paragraphs I will quote principally from Consul\r\nSchenck’s Report, 1890, relating to the growing and procuring of the\r\nbark for shipment, with interpolated sentences and slight changes, made\r\nnecessary by other data at hand. The most common practice is to\r\ncultivate this plant by sowing, which is frequently done, above all, in\r\nground somewhat manured, making alternate furrows with vines. Up to\r\ntheir twentieth or twenty-fifth year the ground is cultivated as if it\r\nwere a vineyard, rooting up at that age the vines on account of\r\nproducing less fruit, and also on account of the cork trees being pretty\r\nwell grown up and no longer requiring the shelter of the vines. At the\r\nend of even one year it is difficult to transplant the cork tree on\r\naccount of the length of the roots, principally the central one, and if\r\nthe trees are put out with the intention of transplanting they are\r\ngenerally sewn in a false ground bottom made artificially at a certain\r\ndepth with layers of stones or bricks. French silviculturists recommend\r\nabout 110 to 120 trees to the hectare (2.471 acres).\r\n\r\nThe cork tree gives but little shade, which contributes greatly in\r\ncausing the soil to become dry. To avoid all these inconveniences, which\r\nare highly unfavorable to the good production of cork, it is requisite\r\nthat young plants grow up with sufficient foliage, so that the branches\r\ntouch each other, and even overreach, till they are about twenty-five\r\nyears old. It may be convenient, if there is not sufficient foliage from\r\nthe cork trees themselves, to introduce secondary species, such as the\r\nelm tree, ash and pine, known as (pi meli), these being depended upon to\r\nsupply the requisite coolness and manure to the ground. If the soil is\r\npoor, the cork is thin but of fine quality and very appropriate to make\r\nthe best stoppers. If, on the contrary, it is rich, the cork is thick\r\nbut spongy. Consequently it is requisite to treat the cork tree in such\r\na manner that whilst the cork grows thick it will at the same time be\r\nfine in texture. This is of course an agricultural problem and may\r\ndiffer from year to year in the necessary details.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDISEASES\r\n\r\n\r\nThe cork tree has in no wise escaped from disease and infections; on the\r\ncontrary it has its full allotted share which worries the growers more\r\nthan the acquiring of a perfect texture, and unless great care is taken\r\nwill greatly reduce the value of a crop. The larva of the Coroebus\r\nundatus (corch) attacks the interior of the cork, penetrating frequently\r\ninto the tree itself, which causes an undervaluation in the quality of\r\nthe cork, and, moreover, these perforations unite so closely and in such\r\na manner even in the trunk of the tree that in peeling off the cork,\r\npart of the skin of the trunk itself comes off, causing much damage to\r\nthe tree.\r\n\r\nThe larva of the Cerambyx cerdo, as well as the ant, Formica rufa L.\r\nhormigas, destroys the fine cork with their numerous borings and\r\ngalleries. Jaspered (Jasperado) is the name by which is known one of the\r\ndefects of the cork which reduces it greatly in value and as far as\r\ncan be learned comes from the tree itself. The porosity of cork is\r\ngreatly increased by the presence of cork-meal, resulting from the\r\ndisintegration of the Sclerenchyma, or stone cells, which penetrate\r\nthe cork fiber and falling to a powder facilitate the entrance of\r\ninfection.[16]\r\n\r\n  [16] _Scientific American_, 1906.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSTRIPPING\r\n\r\n\r\n[17] The corkwood or cork of commerce is the external part or “periderm”\r\nof the cork-oak; and when it has attained a diameter of approximately\r\n12.7 centimeters or the tree measures forty centimeters in circumference\r\naccording to the Spanish governmental regulations, which the tree does\r\nusually by the time it is twenty years old, the bark may be removed. The\r\nstripping generally takes place during July and August, and it is a\r\nprocess which demands skill and care, if injury to the bark is to be\r\navoided. In Algeria the French strippers sometimes use crescent-shaped\r\nsaws, but under the usual Spanish method a hatchet, with a long handle,\r\nis the only implement employed. The bark is cut clear through, around\r\nthe base of the tree, and a similar incision is made around the trunk,\r\njust below the spring of the main branches; the two incisions are then\r\nconnected by one or two longitudinal cuts, following, so far as\r\npossible, the deepest of the natural cracks in the bark. Inserting the\r\nwedge-shaped handle, the tree’s covering is then pried off. The larger\r\nbranches are stripped in the same manner, yielding, generally, a finer\r\ngrade of cork than that of the trunk. The thickness of the bark ranges\r\nfrom 1.27 centimeters to 6.85 centimeters, while the yield also varies\r\ngreatly from twenty to 75 kilograms[18] per tree, depending upon its\r\nsize and age. After the first stripping the tree is left in the\r\njuvenescent state to regenerate, and great care must be taken in the\r\nstripping not to injure the inner skin or epidermis at any stage of the\r\nprocess, for the life of the tree depends upon its proper preservation,\r\nfor if injured at any point, growth there ceases and the spot remains\r\nforever afterward scarred and uncovered. It is also necessary to avoid\r\nstripping during the prevalence of a sirocco, which would dry the inner\r\nskin too rapidly and therefore exclude all further formation of cork.\r\n\r\n  [17] Armstrong Cork Co.’s pamphlet.\r\n\r\n  [18] Kilogram = 2.205 pounds.\r\n\r\nThe Capgrand-Mothe system, which, as known, consists of dressing the\r\ntrunk with the same cork just removed, and leaving it so dressed for a\r\ncouple of months, has not met with approval, as being impracticable on a\r\nlarge scale. After the stripping, the phellogen, the seat of the growing\r\nprocesses, undertakes at once the formation of a new covering of finer\r\ntexture, and each year this, the real skin, with its life-giving sap,\r\nforms two layers of cells, one within, increasing the diameter of the\r\ntrunk, the other without, adding thickness to the sheathing of bark.\r\nAfter eight or ten years this sheathing is removed, and while more\r\nvaluable than the first stripping, it is not as fine in quality as that\r\nof the third and subsequent strippings, which follow at regular\r\nintervals of about nine years. At the age of about forty years the oak\r\nbegins to yield its best bark, continuing productive as a rule for\r\nalmost a century.[19] The cork of the first barking is called\r\nCorcho-Bornio, Borniza or virgin, and is so coarse, rough, and dense in\r\ntexture that it is of little commercial value. The second barking is\r\ncalled “pelas,” or secondary cork, and this and subsequent barkings\r\nconstitute the cork of commerce. As the bark is removed it is gathered\r\nup in piles (rusque) and left for a few days to dry. Having been\r\nweighed, it is next carried either in wagons or on the backs of burros\r\nto the boiling station, where it is stacked and allowed to season for a\r\nfew weeks. It is then ready for the boiling process. The outside of the\r\nbark in its natural state is, as may well be imagined, rough and woody,\r\nowing to exposure to the weather. After boiling this useless outer\r\ncoating is readily scraped off, thereby reducing the weight of the\r\nmaterial almost twenty per cent. The boiling process also serves to\r\nremove the tannic acid, increases the volume and elasticity of the bark,\r\nrenders it soft and pliable and flattens it out for convenient packing.\r\nAfter being roughly sorted as to quality and thickness, the bark is then\r\nready for its first long journey, and as the forests are generally\r\nlocated in hilly or even mountainous country, the faithful burro must\r\nagain be called into service. Truly the Spaniards’ best friend, though\r\nthe worst treated of all, these patient little animals present a most\r\ngrotesque appearance when loaded from head to hind quarters with a huge\r\nmass of the light bark. Down from the hills they go in trains of thirty,\r\nforty or even a hundred, threading the rocky bridle paths in single file\r\nand wending their way through the narrow streets of quaint villages\r\nwhere traces of Moorish occupancy may still be seen, to the nearest\r\nrailway station. The corkwood is there freighted to the various sea-port\r\nwarehouses in Spain and Portugal, Seville, Spain being perhaps the\r\nlargest depository and user of raw material.[20] This historic city,\r\nsituated on the banks of the Guadalquivir, presents a very animated\r\nsight in the summer months, and plays a very important part in the cork\r\nindustry, for besides the numerous warehouses for storing and shipping\r\nthere are factories for the manipulation of cork and its conversion into\r\nthe many useful forms in which it has proven of value. Before shipping,\r\nthe bales are opened, the edges of the bark trimmed and the bark then\r\nsorted into the various grades of quality and thickness again. The\r\nimportance of this last mentioned operation cannot be overemphasized, as\r\nthe whole problem of the successful and economical manufacture of corks\r\ncenter about it. After sorting it is ready to be rebaled for shipment,\r\nthis generally being done by placing the large, flat pieces called\r\nplanks or tables, at the bottom of the bales, and above them the small\r\npieces which are covered in turn with larger sections; then the whole\r\nmass being subjected to pressure to render it compact, afterward being\r\nbound up securely with steel hoops or wires. Each bale carefully marked\r\nindicating the grade or quality, loaded directly into ocean-going\r\nsteamers and shipped to the ports of the world.\r\n\r\n  [19] Mr. Lamey, the author of a study upon cork in Algeria, published\r\n       some interesting tables in this work regarding the annual\r\n       increase and the mean thickness of cork. According to him\r\n       cork-bark should not be removed before it has attained a\r\n       thickness of 2.032 cm., and the formation of new cork has been\r\n       well explained by Mr. Mathieu in his “Forestry Flora.”\r\n\r\n  [20] Armstrong Cork Co.’s pamphlet.\r\n\r\nFrom this meager description we at least can learn what “corkwood” is,\r\nthe limited sphere of its growth, the constant care necessary to insure\r\na successful harvest or gathering, the peculiarities of the tree, its\r\nlongevity and the general mode of preparing the bark for shipment; the\r\nnarration in no wise doing justice to this most interesting material, in\r\nits natural state, for its growing is a fascinating tale in itself; but\r\nfor the purpose of this writing the foregoing has been deemed sufficient\r\nto convey an understanding of it.\r\n\r\nAs we have now seen how this wonderful material grows, its haunts and\r\ndwellings, we will look at it more closely and see what it really is,\r\nhow this particular formation comes about and its peculiarities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOTANY AND CHEMISTRY\r\n\r\n\r\nIn considering “cork” for the purpose of ascertaining its\r\ncharacteristics, texture and composition we will, instead of analyzing\r\nthe material after it has reached the market, look at it from the\r\nstandpoint of botany and learn of its formation upon the tree, from\r\nwhich it is procured. It appears that the word “cork”[21] in botany\r\nsignifies a growth peculiar to all plants and pertaining to none in\r\nparticular, being described as “a peculiar tissue in the higher plants\r\nforming the division of the bark (which name is sometimes restricted to\r\nthe dead tissues lying outside the cork); consisting of closely packed\r\nair-cells nearly impervious to air and water and protects the underlying\r\ntissues.”[22] Again, “It is produced by the activity and division of\r\ncertain merismatic cells known as phellogen or cork cambium which are\r\nsituated immediately within the epidermal covering of the young growth.\r\nAs the cork cells grow older, their protoplasmic contents disappear and\r\nare replaced by air. In order that this formation may be clearly\r\nunderstood, I will quote from a paragraph entitled “Cork and Epidermal\r\nFormations Produced by It” contained in “A Text Book on Botany,” by\r\nSacks.\r\n\r\n  [21] See “Etymology of Word” in preceding chapter.\r\n\r\n  [22] “New English Dictionary,” Murray.\r\n\r\n“When succulent organs of the higher plants, no longer in the bud\r\ncondition, are injured, the wound generally becomes closed up by cork\r\ntissue, i.e., new cells arise near the wounded surface by repeated\r\ndivision of those which are yet sound, and these forming a firm skin\r\nseparate the inner tissue from the outer injured layers of cells. The\r\nwalls of this tissue offer the strongest resistance to the most various\r\nagencies, similar to the cuticular layers of the epidermis in their\r\nphysical behavior, flexible and elastic, permeable only with difficulty\r\nby air and water, they for the most part soon lose their contents and\r\nbecome filled with air. They are arranged in rows lying at right angles\r\nto the surface or parallelopipedal form, and form a close tissue without\r\nintercellular spaces. These are the general distinguishing features of\r\ncork tissue. It is formed not only on wounded surfaces, but arises in\r\nmuch greater mass where succulent organs require an effectual protection\r\n(e.g., potato tubers) or where the epidermis is unable to keep up with\r\nthe increase of circumference where growth in thickness continues for a\r\nlong period. In these cases the cork tissue is formed even before the\r\ndestruction of the epidermis, and when this splits under the action of\r\nthe weather and falls off, the new envelope formed by the cork is\r\nalready present. The cork tissue is the result of repeated bipartitions\r\nof the cells by partition walls, rarely in the epidermis cells\r\nthemselves, more often in the subjacent tissue. The partition walls lie\r\nparallel to the surface of the organ, divisions also taking place in a\r\nvertical direction, by which the number of the rows of cells is\r\nincreased. From the two newly formed thin-walled cells of each radial\r\nrow one remains thin walled and rich in protoplasm, and in a condition\r\ncapable of division; the other becomes transformed into a permanent cork\r\ncell. Thus arises, usually parallel to the surface of the organ, a layer\r\nof cells capable of division, which continues to form new cork cells,\r\nthe cork cambium or layer of phellogen. In general this is the innermost\r\nlayer of the whole cork tissue, so that the production of cork advances\r\noutwardly and new layers of cork are constantly formed out of the\r\nphellogen on the inner surface of those already in existence. When in\r\nthis manner a continuous layer of cork arises, steadily increasing from\r\nthe inside, it is termed “periderm.” As the epidermis is at first\r\nreplaced by the periderm, so in turn is this replaced by cork (the dead\r\ntissue). The development and configuration of the cork cells may change\r\nperiodically during the formation of periderm. Alternate layers of\r\nnarrow, thick-walled and broad, thin-walled cork cells are formed; the\r\nperiderm then appearing stratified, like wood, showing annual rings as\r\nin the periderm of the Quercus Suber, Betula Alba, etc.”\r\n\r\nMr. Sacks, as a botanist, has clearly set forth the explanation of the\r\nformation of the periderm of the Quercus Suber in the foregoing, and\r\nalthough the story of the life producing this formation would be an\r\nacceptable sequel to this explanation, it would in no wise assist in the\r\nultimate findings, and therefore it is dispensed with. Mr. William\r\nAnderson, in a paper read at the Royal Institution of Great Britain in\r\n1886, has the following to say on cork formation, which is very\r\ninteresting: “In considering the properties of most substances, our\r\nsearch for the cause of their properties is baffled by our imperfect\r\npowers and the feeble instruments we possess for investigating molecular\r\nstructure. With cork, happily, this is not the case; an examination of\r\nits structure is easy and perfectly explains the cause of its peculiar\r\nand valuable properties. All plants are built up of minute cells of\r\nvarious forms and dimensions. Their walls or sides are composed chiefly\r\nof a substance called cellulose, frequently associated with lignine, or\r\nwoody matter, and with cork, which last is a nitrogenous substance found\r\nin many portions of plants, but is especially developed in the outer\r\ncork of exogenous trees, that is, belonging to an order, the stems of\r\nwhich grow by the addition of layers of fresh cellulose tissue outside\r\nthe woody part and inside the bark. Between the bark and the wood is\r\ninterposed a thin fibrous layer, which in some trees is very much\r\ndeveloped. The corky part of the bark which is outside is composed of\r\nclosed cells, exclusively, so built together that no connection of a\r\ntubular nature runs up and down the tree, although horizontal passages\r\nradiating toward the woody parts of the tree are numerous. In the woody\r\npart of the tree, on the contrary, and in the inner bark, vertical\r\npassages or tubes exist, while a connection is kept up with the pith of\r\nthe tree by means of medullary rays. In one species of tree, known as\r\nthe cork-oak, this is strongly developed.” It appears that Mr. Anderson\r\nenlivened his lecture by microscopic projections, for he goes on to say:\r\n“First I project on the screen a microscopic section of the wood of the\r\ncork tree. It is taken in a horizontal plane, and I ask you to notice\r\nthe diversity of the structure and especially the presence of large\r\ntubes or pipes. I next exhibit a section taken in the same plane of the\r\ncorky portion of the bark. You see the whole substance is made up of\r\nminute many-sided cells about 1/750 of an inch in diameter and about\r\ntwice as long, the long way being disposed radically to the trunk. The\r\nwalls of the cells are extremely thin and yet they are wonderfully\r\nimpervious to liquids. Looked at by reflected light, bands of silvery\r\nlight alternate with bands of comparative darkness, showing that the\r\ncells are built on end to end in regular order. The vertical section\r\nnext exhibited shows a cross section of the cells like a minute\r\nhoneycomb. In some specimens large crystals are found. These could not\r\nbe distinguished from the detached elementary spindle-shaped cells, of\r\nwhich woody fiber is made up, were it not for the powerful means of\r\nanalysis we have in polarized light. I need hardly explain that light\r\npassed through a Nicol’s prism becomes polarized, that is to say, the\r\nvibrations of the luminiferous ether are all reduced to vibrations in\r\none plane and consequently if a second prism be interposed and placed at\r\nright angles to the first, the light will be unable to get through; but\r\nif we introduce between the crossed Nicol a substance capable of turning\r\nthe plane of vibration again, then a certain light will pass. I have now\r\nprojected on the screen the feeble light emerging from the crossed\r\nNicol. I introduce the microscopic preparation of cork cells between\r\nthem, and you see the crystals glowing with many colored lights on a\r\ndark ground. Minute though these cells are, they are very numerous and\r\nhard, and it is partly to them that is due the extraordinary rapidity\r\nwith which cork blunts the cutting instruments used in shaping it.” In\r\nhis research or experimentations Mr. Anderson was most deeply impressed\r\nwith the elasticity of cork, and has the following to say upon his\r\nfindings: “It would seem difficult to discover any new properties in a\r\nsubstance so familiar as cork, and yet it possesses qualities which\r\ndistinguish it from all other solid or liquid bodies, namely, its power\r\nof altering its volume in a very marked degree in consequence of change\r\nof pressure. All liquids and solids are capable of cubical compression\r\nor extension, but to a very small extent; thus water is reduced in\r\nvolume by only .00005 part by the pressure of one atmosphere. Liquid\r\ncarbonic acid yields to pressure much more than any other fluid, but\r\nstill the rate is very small. Solid substances, with the exception of\r\ncork, offer equally obstinate resistance to change of bulk; even India\r\nrubber, which most people would suppose capable of very considerable\r\nchange of volume, we find it really very rigid. Metals, when subjected\r\nto pressure which exceed their elastic limits so that they are\r\npermanently deformed, as in forging or wire drawing, remain practically\r\nunchanged in volume per unit of weight. Not so with cork, its elasticity\r\nhas not only a very considerable range, but it is very persistent. Thus\r\nin the better kind of corks used in bottling champagne and other\r\neffervescing wines, you are familiar with the extent to which the corks\r\nexpand the instant they escape from the bottles. I have measured this\r\nexpansion and find it to amount to an increase of volume of seventy-five\r\nper cent; even after the corks have been kept in a state of compression\r\nin the bottles for ten years.[23] When cork is subjected to pressure,\r\neither in one direction or from every direction, a certain amount of\r\npermanent deformation or permanent set takes place. This property is\r\ncommon to all solid elastic substances when strained beyond their\r\nelastic limits, but with cork the limits are comparatively low.” To take\r\nadvantage of the peculiar properties of cork in mechanical applications\r\nit is necessary to determine accurately the law of its resistance to\r\ncompression, and for this purpose Mr. Anderson instituted a series of\r\nexperiments of this kind. Into a strong iron vessel of five and one\r\nhalf gallons’ capacity he introduced a quantity of cork and filled the\r\ninterstices with water, carefully getting out all the air. He then\r\nproceeded to pump in water until definite pressures up to one thousand\r\npounds per square inch had been reached, and at every one hundred pounds\r\nthe weight of the water pumped in was determined. In this way, after\r\nmany repetitions, he obtained the decrease of volume due to any given\r\nincrease of pressure. The observations have been plotted into the form\r\nof a curve which is discernible on the accompanying diagram.\r\n\r\n  [23] Showing a permanent set of 12.5 per cent.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: VOLUME OF CORK]\r\n\r\nThe base line represents a cylinder containing one cubic foot of cork\r\ndivided by the vertical lines into ten parts; the black horizontal\r\nlines, according to the scale on the left-hand side, represent the\r\npressures in pounds per square inch which were necessary to compress the\r\ncork to the corresponding volume. Thus to reduce the volume to one half,\r\nrequired a pressure of two hundred and fifty pounds per square inch. At\r\nsixteen hundred pounds per square inch the volume was reduced to\r\nforty-four per cent, the yielding then becoming very little, showing\r\nthat the solid parts of the cells had come together and formed a solid,\r\ncompact mass, thus corroborating Mr. Ogston’s determination that the\r\ngaseous part of cork constitutes about fifty-three per cent of its bulk.\r\n\r\nIn further study it has been found that no matter what compression is\r\nused, providing there is no disintegration, the corkwood will retain\r\njust that slight spongy character that so marks its growth.\r\n\r\nIn analyzing this solid matter, Ure found by treating it with nitric\r\nacid the yielding was:\r\n\r\n  White fibrous matter (cellulose).  0.18 parts\r\n  Resin ........................... 14.72   “\r\n  Oxalic acid ..................... 16.00   “\r\n  Suberic acid .................... 14.4    “\r\n                                    ───────────\r\n                                    45.30 parts\r\n\r\nChevruel in an analysis of corkwood states that he found the following\r\nconstitutents, but he does not give percentages:\r\n\r\n  Cerin, a soft fragrant resin.\r\n  Yellow and red coloring matter.\r\n  Quercitannic acid.\r\n  Gallic acid.\r\n  A brown nitrogenous substance.\r\n  Salts of vegetable acids.\r\n  Calcium.\r\n  Water.\r\n  Suberic acid.\r\n  Suberin (cellulose).\r\n\r\nI am inclined to think that Chevruel selected a poor grade of cork, full\r\nof stone cells and Jasperado, as his findings include much that would\r\nindicate that was the case.\r\n\r\nIn further defining the various substances which go to make up the body\r\nof corkwood the one that is most impressive is that substance that is\r\npeculiar to cork itself, the others being readily known, but suberic\r\nacid is the one of interest, and this is described by Fownes as a\r\nproduct of the oxidation of cork by nitric acid; is a white crystalline\r\npowder, sparingly soluble in cold water, fusible and volatile by heat,\r\nthe chemical formula given being (C_{4}H_{14}O_{4}). Suberic acid is\r\nalso described as a dibasic acid which forms small granular crystals\r\nvery soluble in boiling water, alcohol and ether. It fuses at 300\r\ndegrees Fahrenheit and sublimes in acidular crystals. It is also\r\nproduced when nitric acid acts on stearic, margaric or oleic acid. The\r\nchemical analysis is given as (C_{8}H_{14}O_{4}) and I am inclined to\r\nbelieve it is the truer one, as it is much later than Fownes’.\r\n\r\nThis suberic acid has been further broken up to ascertain its\r\nfundamental characteristics and it was found to partake of the two\r\ncompounds suberone and suberate.\r\n\r\nSuberone (C_{14}H_{24}O_{2}) being regarded as the ketone of suberic\r\nacid, an aromatic liquid compound obtained when suberic acid is\r\ndistilled with an excess of lime.[24] Also described as a colorless oil\r\nwith an odor of peppermint and a boiling point of 179 to 181 degrees\r\nCentigrade, chemical formula, Suberone—Cycloheptanone—\r\n\r\n     CH_{2} .

Dr. Robert K. Duncan, Prof. of Industrial Chemistry\r\nin the University of Kansas, informs us that this material is the\r\ncommonest of common things[27] and when dry, forms one third of all the\r\nvegetable matter in the world. This mysterious substance is the\r\nstructural basis of the wood, but with all its prominence and use, we\r\nknow nothing more about it than that which is expressed in the formula.\r\n\r\n  [25] “Watt’s Dictionary” (“M” signifying metal).\r\n\r\n  [26] “Century Dictionary.”\r\n\r\n  [27] _Review of Reviews_, September, 1906.\r\n\r\nThe presence of this cellulose is only a natural fact, as the greater\r\npart of plant life is cellulose; nor is the list of elements that go to\r\nmake up the solid matter so strange and unaccountable, but the quality\r\nthat makes it a wonderful growth and so popular above its fellows is its\r\nlightness—this is its commendable feature and it is light indeed.\r\n\r\nUre puts the specific gravity at .24 and this is concurred in by\r\nBrisbane.\r\n\r\n\r\nTEST OF CORKWOOD FOR ASCERTAINING THE POSSIBLE PRESENCE OF AN ESSENTIAL\r\nOIL, BY STEAM DISTILLATION\r\n\r\nTwo tests were made on this material to ascertain the presence of an\r\nessential oil. The first showed the presence of an oily film,\r\nresplendent in colorings, opalescent, variegated and beautiful, but\r\nodorless and of such small quantity that it may safely be said “No Oil.”\r\n\r\nThe second proved the same as the first, and although the strong odor of\r\ncork or suberic acid was present, no oil appeared.\r\n\r\nThe results of these tests indicate that there is no essential oil in\r\ncorkwood obtainable by steam distillation.\r\n\r\nTEST NO. 1\r\n\r\n4-4-1913.\r\n\r\nA copper still, supported on two trunnions, fitted with a dome and\r\ngoose-neck, which terminated in a tin coil (water cooled), and with a\r\nperforated bottom through which the steam passed, was used.\r\n\r\nThis measured two inches in diameter and two inches high, from the\r\nperforated plate to the top of the pot, the dome being about one foot\r\nhigher.\r\n\r\nInto this still was placed 41 pounds of corkwood, as it comes from the\r\ncutters and punchers (scrap pieces), no preliminary washing or preparing\r\nbeing done; this 41 pounds filled the pot or the still.\r\n\r\nAll things made tight, using an asbestos packing, the steam was turned\r\non at 70 pounds and run for one hour.\r\n\r\nTEST NO. 2\r\n\r\n4-15-1913.\r\n\r\nSame still used as in Test No. 1, thirty pounds of a clean, good grade\r\nGranulated Cork, of a fineness to pass a 1/16″ mesh, was put into the\r\nstill—this half filling same.\r\n\r\nSteam turned on at 70 pounds and run for one hour.\r\n\r\nTests made at A.

We\r\ncomment upon its growth, which is truly wonderful and all-absorbing in\r\nits many interesting phases; it takes us to the romance of the East and\r\nthe enchantment of the Moorish occupation; through which these forests\r\nof cork-producing trees passed and yet remain to furnish the present\r\ngeneration. We comment upon its lightness and buoyancy, due to the\r\npresence of air and excess of hydrogen, known to be lighter than air;\r\nand the small percentage of other matter which, being of less\r\nimportance, make its other quality so renowned as to make it the most\r\nwonderful growth of its kind. Its imperviousness to water and other\r\nliquids have given us moments of reflection, upon this phenomenon, but\r\nnow known to be because of the cellulose composing the cell walls and\r\nwhich, when the substance is under compression, practically is all that\r\nremains, except for the small quantity of resin, etc., to resist the\r\npassage of liquids or gases. But heretofore when these commentations\r\nhave reached the burning point, its physical nature was entirely\r\neliminated from the conjecturing and the important part neglected, that\r\nas the cork contained fifty-three per cent of air, heat of 450 degrees\r\nexpands to the point of explosion, the contents of those cells nearest\r\nthe surface, which giving up their oxygen feed the flames and in their\r\npassage help to disintegrate the cell walls and make them more easily\r\nignited. Thus causing a rapid burning, flash fire which, in its fury,\r\nPluto could not rival, only racing over the surface of the cork, burning\r\nbut slightly, yet helped by other conditions, resulting in a fire\r\ndestructive and fierce. This rapid burning leaves the outer surface of\r\nthe cork charred and flaky and causes a discoloration beneath it\r\nattributed to the dissolving of the resins, etc. Of course where there\r\nis a large quantity of corkwood the extent of the burning must\r\nnecessarily be greater and the depth of the char increased. But it\r\nappears that the first flash burning produces a sort of protection coat\r\nof carbon around the remaining unburned portions which a subsequent\r\nflame penetrates with difficulty.[28]\r\n\r\n  [28] In the making of insulation material, the carbonization of the\r\n       cork is accomplished without destruction of fibre and stands a\r\n       high flame test.\r\n\r\nA simple experiment to show this depth of burning, and one that is easy\r\nto do, is the flash and flame test which was found of interest.\r\n\r\nTwo pieces of cork were taken, having the following measurements—8/16″\r\n× 7/16″ × 11/16″—and the first piece held so that the flame of a gas\r\njet would cause a flash over its surface; then the second piece is taken\r\nand held within the flame for a minute.\r\n\r\nIt will be found that the corkwood has expanded and the dimensions\r\nincreased to the following:\r\n\r\n        Flash                         Flame\r\n  8/16″ × 13/16″ × 11/16″      10/16″ × 14/16″ × 11/16″\r\n\r\nshowing the effects of the heat upon the tissue and contents of the\r\ncells.\r\n\r\nNow in scraping these samples clean of all char the dimensions will\r\nreturn to the following:\r\n\r\n        Flash                         Flame\r\n  6/16″ × 11/16″ × 11/16″        8/16″ × 10/16″ × 11/16″\r\n\r\nclearly setting forth the fact that the char is comparatively light in\r\nboth cases, ranging from 1/8″ to 1/4″.\r\n\r\nTo this cause is ascribed the burnability of cork having by careful\r\nobservation and experiment, extending over a period of two years,\r\nstudied the results of numerous fires in premises where cork was being\r\nworked and also conducted heat applications on various grades of\r\ncork[29] resulting in the foregoing findings.[30] Thus it is found that\r\ncork contains sufficient air to supply any fire in it and precludes the\r\nnecessity of free access to any outside supply which makes it a material\r\nworthy to be watched. To its many qualities of great service to man,\r\ngiving him a material which from the ages past, till now, has proven of\r\nsuch value, must be added this one, no less important than others, which\r\nheretofore have been its commendable features.\r\n\r\n  [29] Using ordinary glass (armoured) thermometer for ascertaining\r\n       degrees.\r\n\r\n  [30] One thousand degrees Fahrenheit, causing no greater combustion\r\n       than the lower degree, other than the increased burning of\r\n       remaining substance after the flash, due to the higher\r\n       temperature.\r\n\r\nRather than attend the “cork” through the many passages of commerce and\r\nmanufacture, it is deemed propitious to deviate a little from a natural\r\ncourse, i.e., from the growing to manufacture and rather advance to a\r\nknowledge of the many uses to which this material is put and its\r\napplication to the innumerable arts, and then take up the manufacture.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUSES AND APPLICATION\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. H. G. Glasspoole,[31] writing regarding the uses of cork by the\r\nancients, states: “The cork-tree, and the application of its bark to\r\nuseful purposes, was well known to the Egyptians, Greeks and Romans. The\r\nformer used this material in the construction of the coffins for their\r\ndead. Theophrastus, the Greek philosopher, who wrote on botany four\r\ncenturies B.C., mentions this tree among the oaks, under the name of\r\n‘Phellus’ in Book Two of his ‘Historia Plantarum,’ and stated that it\r\nwas a native of the Pyrenees, having a thick fleshy bark which must be\r\nstripped off every three years to prevent it from perishing. He adds\r\nthat it was so light as never to sink in water, and on that account\r\nmight be used for many purposes.” It is the opinion of the writer that\r\nthe attention of the ancients was undoubtedly called to this particular\r\nbark by its buoyancy, and as their fisheries were extensive its\r\nusefulness became readily apparent to float nets, etc., or to use\r\neven in the construction of their boats, and its sponginess and\r\nwater-repellent properties not escaping their notice, it became a most\r\nlikely material for stoppers of casks or amphorae as noted by Horace in\r\nOde iii, 8: “Corticem adstrictum pice dimovebit amphorae.” Pliny, in his\r\n“Natural History,” XVI, 18, describes the tree under the name of Suber\r\nand relates everything said by Theophrastus of Phellus. From his account\r\nwe learn that the Roman fishermen used it as floats to their nets and\r\nfishing tackle, and as buoys to their anchors. The use of these buoys in\r\nsaving life appears to have been well known to the ancients, for Lucian,\r\nEpist. i, 17, mentions that when two men, one of whom had fallen into\r\nthe sea, and another who jumped after to afford him assistance, both\r\nwere saved by means of an anchor buoy. The use of this substance in\r\nassisting swimmers was not unknown to the Romans, for Plutarch in his\r\nLife of Camillus, who flourished in Rome 400 B.C., gives an account of\r\nits use by a messenger, sent to the Capitol, then besieged by the Gauls:\r\n“Pontius Cominius having dressed himself in mean attire under which he\r\nconcealed some pieces of cork. He could not pass the river by the\r\nbridge, therefore took off his clothes, which he fastened upon his head,\r\nand having laid himself upon the pieces of cork swam over and reached\r\nthe city.” The use of cork as stoppers was entirely unknown to the\r\nRomans, but instances of its being employed may be seen in Cato’s “De Re\r\nRustica,” Cap. 120, but this did not happen frequently or more would be\r\nsaid of it.\r\n\r\n  [31] _Scientific American Supplement._\r\n\r\nThe convivial customs of those days had no connection with the bottle,\r\nglass bottles being of a much later invention. Instead of having\r\nchampagne or hock to be liberated from the bottle by the corkscrew at\r\ntheir feasts, the guests filled their drinking cups of gold, silver,\r\ncrystal or beechwood from a two-handled amphora, a kind of earthenware\r\npitcher, in which their choice wines used to be kept. The mouths of\r\nthese vessels were stopped with wood and covered with a mastic, composed\r\nof pitch, chalk and oil to prevent air spoiling the wine or evaporation\r\ntaking place. Columella, who wrote one of the earliest works on\r\nagriculture, gives directions for preparing this cement.\r\n\r\nThe employment of cork for stoppers of bottles appears to have come into\r\nuse about the seventeenth century, when glass bottles, of which no\r\nmention is made before the fifteenth century, began to be generally\r\nintroduced. Before that period apothecaries used stoppers of wax, which\r\nwere not only much more expensive but far more troublesome. In 1553,\r\nwhen C. Stephanus wrote his “Praedium Rusticum,” cork stoppers appear to\r\nhave been very little known in France, for he states that this material\r\nwas used principally for soles in that country. It is not known when\r\ncork and corks began to be generally used, but in that very amusing and\r\ninstructive diary of Mr. Samuel Pepys the following entry is found: “14\r\nJuly 1666” After having written to the Duke of York for money for the\r\nfleet, I went down Thames Street and there agreed for four or five tons\r\nof cork to be sent to the fleet, being a new device to make barricados\r\nwith instead of junts (old cable),” but he does not inform us how the\r\nmaterial answered.[32]\r\n\r\n  [32] I have subsequently learned that this proved a failure.\r\n\r\nIn Evelyn’s time (1664) cork was much used by old persons for\r\nlinings to the soles of their shoes, whence the German name for it,\r\n“Pantoffelholtz” or slipper wood. The Venetian dames, Evelyn says, used\r\nit for their choppings or high-heeled shoes to make them appear taller\r\nthan nature intended they should be. The poor of Spain lay planks of\r\ncork by their bedside to tread on instead of carpets. Sometimes they\r\nline the inside of their houses, built with stone, with this bark, which\r\nrenders them very warm and corrects the moisture of the air. Loudon\r\nrelates that in the celebrated convent at Cintra, Portugal, several\r\narticles of furniture are made of this tree. Virgin cork, or the first\r\nbark of the tree, is now very much used for window flower boxes,\r\ngrottoes, etc., while the subsequent grades are used for small\r\narchitectural and geognostic models. Cork was formerly employed in\r\nmedicine even as far back as the time of Pliny, as he tells us that the\r\nbark of the cork tree, pulverized and taken in warm water, arrests\r\nhemorrhage at the mouth and nostrils, and the ashes of it taken in warm\r\nwine are highly extolled as a cure for spitting blood (see Pliny, “Nat.\r\nHist.” b. 124). In modern time powdered cork has been applied as a\r\nstyptic and hung about the necks of nurses. It was thought to possess\r\nthe power of stopping the secretion of milk. Burnt cork mixed with sugar\r\nof lead has been used as an application to piles. See Pereira’s “Materia\r\nMedica.”\r\n\r\nGround cork and India rubber formed the basis of Kamptulicon, the soft\r\nunresounding material which covered the floor of the reading rooms of\r\nthe British Museum.” In further describing the many uses to which cork\r\nis applied, reference is made to the résumé of Mr. Good in “La Nature,”\r\nwhich is incorporated with a few slight changes.\r\n\r\n“The various applications of cork that we are now going to pass in\r\nreview are worthy of description, as each of such applications has its\r\n_raison d’être_ in one or more of the physical or chemical properties of\r\ncork bark. The manufacture of stoppers utilizes, in the first place, the\r\nimpermeability of the bark, and, in the second, the latter’s elasticity\r\nand imputrescibility, the remarkable lightness playing no rôle therein.\r\n\r\nBefore entering upon a study of the industrial applications of cork, in\r\ngrouping them according to the various qualities of this product, we\r\nmust return to the “male” cork, derived from the first barking of the\r\ntree. It has been said, because of its slight elasticity and numerous\r\nfissures, this product has but little commercial value, and shall have\r\nmentioned its principal application when we have stated that it is used\r\nin the decoration of parks and gardens. An endeavor has been made, but\r\nwithout success, to manufacture from it, mills for decorticating rice.\r\n\r\nCertain parts of it can be converted into small stoppers. In the country\r\nwhere it is produced, it is used for making water conduits, beehives and\r\nshelves on which to preserve objects from dampness. Mixed with a mortar\r\nof clay, the Kabyles use it for the walls of their dwellings, and also,\r\nin lieu of tiles, as a roofing material for their primitive habitations.\r\nIt is used also by fishermen as floats for their nets.\r\n\r\nThese various applications were known to the Greeks and Romans, as shown\r\nby the works of Theophrastus and Pliny. The latter says of the cork-oak:\r\n“Nothing is utilized but its bark, which is very thick, and which is\r\nrenewed in measure as it is removed. This bark is often used for the\r\nbuoys of anchors and ships and of fishermen’s nets, for the bungs of\r\ncasks, and for women’s winter foot gear. The Greeks called the cork-oak\r\nthe ‘bark tree’.... Cork bark is used as a covering for roofs.” (“Hist.\r\nNat.,” xvi, 18.) As for the chips, they can be used as an isolating\r\nmaterial to prevent freezing. Reduced to fragments, they furnish an\r\nexcellent material for covering circus rings.\r\n\r\nLet us return to “female” cork, which is much better adapted for being\r\nworked, and the grain of which is much more homogeneous. In this form\r\ncork bark constitutes a very bad conductor of heat and sound, and\r\nrenders valuable services in the industries as a material for\r\npreventing the cooling of steam pipes and generators, and preventing\r\nthe melting of ice in ice houses, or the heating of apparatus for\r\nproducing cold.\r\n\r\nIt is the basis of a certain number of cements, and coatings for\r\npreventing the escape of heat, which are applied to pipes, steam domes,\r\nhot water reservoirs, etc., and upon the composition of which we shall\r\nnot dwell here. As for jacketing with cork alone; the first method\r\nconsists in placing narrow strips of cork, whose edges touch each other,\r\nalong steam pipes and cylinders, and fastening them by means of wire. A\r\npipe thus jacketed is tangent internally to all these strips, and a\r\nsection of the whole shows a circle inscribed in a polygon. In the\r\nsecond system thin strips of cork, fastened to canvas with India rubber\r\ncement, are wound around the pipe spirally. Finally, a third method of\r\njacketing consists in the use of two half cylinders that exactly fit the\r\nexterior of the steam pipe. These cylinders, which can be made of any\r\ndesired length, are made of powdered cork and starch, and are covered\r\nwith a spirally wound strip of calico, which may be coated with tar or\r\nany suitable kind of paint. Each of these systems permits of obtaining a\r\ngreat saving in fuel.\r\n\r\nAs cork is likewise a very bad conductor of sound, it is successfully\r\nused on the doors of consulting rooms, and for making floors for\r\nhospitals, etc. Finally, in the manufacture of certain stringed\r\ninstruments, it is used to prevent a loss of sound.\r\n\r\nThe slight density of cork, as compared with water, and its\r\nimpermeability to liquids, make it an excellent float, capable not only\r\nof remaining on the surface, but also of supporting quite heavy bodies\r\nthereon. We shall be content to mention the annular cork float used in\r\nnight lamps, the square block in which bath thermometers are fixed, and\r\nthe fisherman’s dobber.\r\n\r\nIt is cork, too, that is used by preference in the manufacture of\r\nswimming and life-saving apparatus, to which inventors have devoted much\r\nthought. Very many vessels are provided with cork mattresses, which, in\r\ncases of shipwreck, render the greatest services. For example, the ship\r\n_Constant_, which sailed from Anvers for Brazil in 1845, was wrecked on\r\nthe night of October 12th, at twelve miles from St. Thanes, but, thanks\r\nto the cork life preservers and mattresses that she had on board, not\r\none of the crew was lost. As for life-saving buoys, properly so called,\r\nthey consist of several cork planks which are given an annular form, and\r\nare provided with free ropes that are knotted here and there so that\r\nthey may be easily grasped. From the stern of every vessel a buoy of\r\nthis kind is suspended by a rope that may be at once cut when the cry of\r\n“A man overboard!” is heard. These buoys are usually covered with canvas\r\ncoated with a paint that serves to preserve it. It is also possible to\r\nsave a person who has fallen into the water at a certain distance from a\r\nwharf by means of floats. This device consists of a piece of rattan\r\nprovided with points around which molten lead has been poured, and the\r\nwhole is then surrounded with cork in chips, and covered externally with\r\ncanvas and a network to protect the affair against wear.\r\n\r\nFenders are canvas bags that are filled with cork and are placed along\r\nthe sides of ships or along docks in order to deaden the shock in case\r\nof a collision. Such are the principal uses rendered to navigation by\r\ncork.\r\n\r\nIt has already been seen, by the extract from Pliny, that Roman ladies\r\npreserved their feet from cold by means of cork soles. Such a use of\r\ncork is still in vogue. In addition to these soles, which are flat,\r\nthere are others that have nothing to do with hygiene, and are merely\r\nconnected with fashion. Such are the Louis Quatorze talonettes, designed\r\nto increase the stature without exaggerating the heel of the shoe.\r\nFemale dancers wear linings of this kind in their shoes, which, as well\r\nknown, have flat soles. A thin sheet of cork enclosed in the sole of the\r\nshoe would, we think, prove very useful to troops on a march during bad\r\nweather.\r\n\r\nCork is not only useful as an application to foot gear, but also renders\r\ngreat service in head gear, and, in the form of helmets, has preserved a\r\nlarge number of soldiers from death by sunstroke in tropical countries.\r\nWe find it again, in the form of very thin sheets, in the interior of\r\nbeaver hats, where it is used as a protection against heat. It is also\r\nused in these same hats as a sweat band, in lieu of leather. In ladies’\r\ntoilets, the cork serves to make the carcasses of the birds that\r\ndecorate their head gear. Manufacturers of dress trimmings use cork\r\nmolds, which they cover with silk or cotton, for ornamenting cloaks,\r\netc. The lightness of cork can alone explain the great size of these\r\nballs, olives, etc., some of which are larger than a hen’s egg.\r\n\r\nA few years ago, a Paris house sold cork cravats, and we have recently\r\nseen, exposed in a show case, some children’s costumes, in which the\r\nsailor’s collar was of thin sheet cork decorated with colored designs.\r\nAlthough cork gowns have not yet appeared, we have waterproofs composed\r\nof thin sheet cork cemented between two pieces of silk. These cloaks\r\nhave the advantage over those made of rubber of not allowing air to pass\r\nthrough them.\r\n\r\nThere is also a curious application of cork in the manufacture of a\r\nfabric that renders those who are clothed with it insubmergible.\r\n\r\nWe can mention but few of the many applications of cork, new ones of\r\nwhich are being discovered every day, so shall confine ourselves to\r\nrecalling the services rendered by this valuable product in surgical\r\nprosthesis and for the use of naturalists, etc. In domestic life, it is\r\nused for bath steps, and for making rolling pins for crushing almonds\r\nwithout absorbing the oils as wood would do. Thin sheets of it are used\r\nfor making fancy labels for wines. The ease with which it may be cut,\r\nturned and worked causes it to be employed in the manufacture of small\r\nobjects, such as rural landscapes and the reproductions of monuments,\r\nsome of which are genuine works of art. We may likewise mention, among\r\nobjects made of cork, cases of various forms for sending bottles by\r\nmail, spools for allowing of the cheap carriage of silk, the\r\nold-fashioned inkstand, the thick penholder for preventing writer’s\r\ncramp, the cigar holder and many fancy objects that would take too long\r\nto enumerate. There is perhaps no calling that does not have to make\r\nmore or less use of cork. Polishers of gold have used it from time\r\nimmemorial, in the form of narrow strips, for rubbing their work with\r\nrouge. The wheels with which crystals are polished are faced with it,\r\nand watchmaker’s lens mounted in cork, the lightness of which prevents\r\nthe muscles of the face from tiring.\r\n\r\nIn the industries, driving pulleys are now beginning to be provided with\r\ncork in order to secure an adhesion of the belting. In carpenter shops\r\nthese bands of cork are now advantageously replacing rubber ones for\r\ncovering the pulleys over which the band saw runs. The stoppers of\r\nnursing bottles are now being replaced by hygienic ones of cork, which,\r\nbeing very cheap, can be changed as soon as the presence of ferments is\r\nsuspected. Cork is likewise employed in the manufacture of children’s\r\ntoys; it serves, for example, for fixing the wig on dolls’ heads. Is it\r\nnecessary to recall the cork of pop-guns and pistols, and the cork\r\nbattledores and shuttlecocks used for playing with indoors? These few\r\ndata will serve to show that but few products are capable of so many\r\ndiverse applications as cork is; and the question may be asked whether\r\nit would be possible to substitute anything else for it, in case the\r\nsupply should become exhausted.\r\n\r\nThe manufacture of stoppers and of the various objects that we have just\r\nenumerated furnishes a considerable quantity of chips, which along with\r\nthe waste derived from the collecting of the material, and with old,\r\nsecond-hand corks, constitutes the crude material destined to supply\r\ncertain important industries, which, for the sake of completeness, must\r\nbe mentioned.\r\n\r\nWe have first the cork powder industry, which manufactures powders of\r\nvarious degrees of fineness. The coarsest powder is used for packing\r\nfragile objects, on account of its elasticity, coupled with its\r\nlightness, which permits of a great saving in freight charges.\r\n\r\nThe finest powder forms, “liegine” or “suberine,” whose balsamic\r\nproperties are well known to hygienists, and which may be used as a\r\nsubstitute for lycopodium, starch and fecula as an application to the\r\nskin of babes. Under the name of “zifa powder,” an insect powder has\r\nbeen made composed of cork and phenol. Fire lighters have likewise been\r\nmade from cork powder; but this and the last named application have not\r\namounted to much.\r\n\r\nWe cannot enter into much detail in regard to the manufacture of\r\nlinoleum, notwithstanding the interest that it presents. The manufacture\r\nbegan in Scotland, and is tending to settle in our own country. Linoleum\r\nis made by intimately mixing cork powder with oxidized linseed oil. The\r\npaste thus prepared is spread over canvas if the intention is to\r\nmanufacture carpets, but over paper if it is desired to make hangings.\r\nThe color of linoleum, which is the same as that of cork, only a shade\r\ndarker, can be enlivened by colored designs. When applied to damp walls,\r\nlinoleum is capable of receiving oil paintings of a more stable nature\r\nthan those executed upon wood, which warps, or upon other building\r\nmaterials, which crack, such as plaster, for example. It can also be\r\nused for decorated ceilings for public halls, cafes, etc.; and when such\r\nceilings become black through smoke and dust, they can be washed.\r\n\r\nAs a carpet, linoleum renders flooring perfectly insonorous. It converts\r\ndamp and unhealthy apartments into healthy and warm places of\r\nhabitation. Used in kitchens and offices, it has the advantage of not\r\nbeing spotted by fatty matters. It has been generally adopted in our\r\nnaval and merchant ships, where the use of it has given a great setback\r\nto the oil cloth industry.\r\n\r\nA new decorative product, “lino-burgau,” obtained by embossing linoleum,\r\npossesses the iridescent reflections of nacre, due to the application of\r\ncolored varnish along with a bronzing of certain parts. Notwithstanding\r\nits expensive nature, we believe that there is a great future in store\r\nfor it.\r\n\r\nThe manufacture of agglomerates of cork is becoming very widespread in\r\nFrance. We have already mentioned the use of artificial cork for\r\njacketing steam pipes, and we have stated that this product is obtained\r\nby mixing cork powder and starch under pressure. This dried paste can be\r\ngiven the most diverse forms, and be made of any thickness. Another\r\nsubstance, called brick paste, is obtained by mixing the coarsest cork\r\npowder with milk of lime, and, after compression and drying,\r\nconstitutes, under the form of bricks and slabs, an excellent material\r\nfor the construction of party walls, for covering damp walls and sloping\r\nroofs.\r\n\r\nIn the cellars of breweries, these bricks diminish the melting of the\r\nice. In gunpowder works, they prevent the caking of the powder through\r\ndampness, and, in case of an explosion, their friability and lightness\r\nlessen the importance of the catastrophe. They are also used as a\r\nfoundation for flooring in order to destroy its disagreeable\r\nsonorousness. In the spinning mills of Alsace and the west of France,\r\nthey have given excellent results, both as regards their resistance to\r\nthe passage of sound, heat and cold, and their cheapness.\r\n\r\nCork chips and waste, when distilled, furnish an illuminating gas that\r\nburns with more brilliancy than that made from coal, and does not, like\r\nthe latter, give off sulphureous emanations that tarnish frames and\r\nother gilded objects. The city of Nerac was lighted with cork gas for a\r\ncertain length of time, but the use of it had to be given up on account\r\nof the difficulty of storing the chips, which, with but little weight,\r\ntook up an enormous space. This gas, in view of its slight density and\r\nits purity, would prove an excellent one for the inflation of balloons.\r\n\r\nFinally, cork parings and waste, properly carbonized, produce Spanish or\r\ncork black, one of the most beautiful and durable blacks known in\r\npainting.”\r\n\r\nThe recent uses for corkwood are, as a float in the carburetter of an\r\nautomobile, the cork insert in the periphery of a pulley,[33] cork paper\r\nfor cigarette tips, a wadding for shot-gun cartridges, cork-coated\r\nfabric for balloons, as a filling for automobile tires, as a disk in the\r\nnon-refillable bottle, for the making of casks and barrels in which to\r\nstore wine, and the ground cork wood for shipping fruit, etc. in, to\r\nprevent spoiling.\r\n\r\n  [33] See Lawrence Whitcomb’s article in _Industrial Engineering_,\r\n       September, 1910.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUBSTITUTES\r\n\r\nOf course, no matter what the substance, a substitute is always sought\r\nfor, and this has been the case with cork, but with very unfruitful\r\nresults. “A primitive material used for bottle stoppers consisted of the\r\nroots of liquorice; the spongy substance of another tree called\r\n‘Spondies Lutea,’ which abounds throughout the marshy regions of South\r\nAmerica and there called ‘Monbia,’ was also used in the same way, as\r\nalso a product called ‘Myssa,’ which contains some of the elements of\r\ncork.[34] Another substitute is mentioned in Henley’s “Twentieth Century\r\nReceipts” as follows: Wood pulp three parts; cornstarch pith one part;\r\ngelatin one part; glycerine one part; water four parts; 20 per cent\r\nsolution formic aldehyde; and still another in the “Handyman’s ‘Inquire\r\nWithin,’” by Haslock, called “Phellosene,” a French invention consisting\r\nof powdered cork mixed with a solution of nitro-cellulose in acetone:\r\ncompressed and dried. The wood of Anona palustris growing in the West\r\nIndies, and called the alligator’s apple, is used by the negroes to stop\r\ntheir jugs and calabashes also, and a Mr. Brockedon invented a\r\nsubstitute as noted in “Knight’s Cyclopedia,” the core of which was\r\ncotton twisted into strands, wound with flax and the whole covered with\r\nIndia rubber. Cork’s competitor in buoyancy, “balsa wood,” is in no wise\r\nconstituted to take its place, although 20 per cent lighter; as it is a\r\nfibrous growth and hygroscopic, requiring a coat of water-proofing\r\nsolution before it can be used even for life-preservers; rubber, its\r\nclose second, in the manufacture of stoppers is not to be compared with\r\nit, and although there have been many patent devices for sealing\r\nbottles, such as the porcelain stopper, crimped metal stoppers, etc.,\r\nthe cork stopper still reigns as the best of them all.\r\n\r\n  [34] _Chambers Journal._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMANUFACTURE\r\n\r\n\r\nIn describing the manner and process of converting the corkwood into the\r\nvarious commercial forms, no attempt will be made to give a scientific\r\nexposition of all the details, as being inconsistent with the character\r\nof this monograph, nor will any other processes be described than the\r\nones in which the material being worked, is cork.

Appended is a\r\ndiagram that will give some idea of the utilization of corkwood.\r\n\r\nThe corkwood bale as received, measures as a general rule 2′ × 2′7″ × 4′\r\nand is securely strapped with iron bands about one inch in width and a\r\nthickness of 1/16″ to 1/32″, and the weight depending upon the quality\r\nof corkwood ranging from 150 pounds to 200 pounds per bale.\r\n\r\n\r\nSORTING\r\n\r\nThe first operation, that is, the first thing done with the corkwood, is\r\nthe sorting. This is becoming more important as the uses of cork\r\nincrease, as various grades can be used for so many particular things\r\nnow, without the necessity of being called a by-product; but the\r\nprincipal divisions are: superfine, fine, common and coarse.\r\n\r\nThese of course are now extended to many classes, and is resulting in\r\ncareful scrutiny of the shipments and stock, the sorter becoming an\r\nexpert, and an increasing factor in the business. His knowledge not only\r\nincluding the grades of corkwood, but the uses to which the various\r\ngrades may be put so that waste is avoided and the full value gotten out\r\nof all.\r\n\r\n\r\nCORK STOPPER MAKING\r\n\r\nAfter the sorting, the slabs are placed in steam boxes and subjected to\r\na steam bath, which it is claimed softens the material and also prepares\r\nit for the scraper, who cleans and removes the dirt and callous or\r\n“raspa” accumulated in its mountain home. This scraping is done either\r\nby hand or machine, the handwork being done with a short handle, curved\r\nbladed knife called a “doladera,” raspador or raspeta: a workman being\r\nable to scrape from two to three metric quintals of cork in a day, or\r\nten hours. The scraper machine being a vertical steel shaft carrying\r\nseveral knives placed at a very slight helix and making about 1400\r\nrevolutions per minute and will scrape from ten to twelve metric\r\nquintals[35] per day or ten hours. Cutting the slabs into strips or\r\nfillets (tiras ó’rebanadas) is the next step. These strips, the width of\r\nwhich is equal to the length of the cork to be cut, as the cutting is\r\ndone across and not with the grain, were formerly cut by hand with a\r\nknife having a flat surface and curved edge called “cuchilla de\r\nrebanar,” but now replaced by the circular knife, which operates the\r\nsame as a rip-saw. From here the strips go to the stopper-makers’\r\npunches or blocking machines. This machine has a rotating tubular die\r\nwith sharpened edges of the diameter of the cork to be cut, made to\r\nrevolve about two thousand revolutions per minute, the operator having a\r\nfoot lever attachment which permits him to thrust the die through the\r\nstrips of cork as he holds it against a resisting piece parallel with\r\nthe operating plane of the die. Thus, he can punch out many thousands of\r\ncorks a day, the noise of the punches being a very characteristic sound\r\nin all such establishments. The operator, of course, must use care to\r\navoid defective spots in the bark, and also to cut the corks out as\r\nclosely together as possible so as to reduce waste to a minimum. For it\r\nis here that the cork manufacturer seems to lay his particular lament.\r\nIf he could but make his corks the sizes most in demand, ship them and\r\nthereby do a business that would clearly figure up the year’s work, and\r\nperhaps keep a surplus on hand for unexpected orders. But this he cannot\r\ndo, for almost every cork he cuts there is enough waste material to make\r\nthree or four smaller sizes, and this he fain would discard if it were\r\nnot for the possible profit there is in it; and consequently in almost\r\nevery cork factory will be found a large surplus stock of all sizes, and\r\nthe owner anxiously hoping that some one will take them off his hands.\r\n\r\n  [35] The metric quintal is used officially in Spain, which is equal\r\n       to 220.36 pounds, the Catalon quintal equaling 91.71 pounds.\r\n\r\nThe stoppers which come from these machines are round with parallel\r\nsides. If tapered corks are desired, larger at the upper end than at the\r\nlower, the cylindrical or straight pieces must be passed through another\r\nmachine which handles them deftly, holding them against the edge of\r\nanother circular knife; seemingly motionless, the only outward\r\nindication of the speed with which the keen blade is revolving being a\r\ndelicate shaving which curls upward for an instant, and then is drawn\r\naway by air suction to the waste bin, where this material is all\r\ncollected and used in various, useful ways as will be shown later. In\r\ncutting the corks, although care is exercised, many will be imperfect\r\nand defective, and in order to utilize them they are cut into smaller\r\nsizes by men who sit at low tables and deftly handle the sharp-edged\r\nknife, which with one stroke reduces the cork to the size that it can\r\nfill, using a scale which is apparently standard with all cork dealers.\r\n\r\nThe general standard of corks or stoppers, known as the United States\r\nstandard, is as follows:\r\n\r\nSCALE OF DIAMETER OF STOPPERS\r\n\r\n_United States Standard, showing Diameter at Large End_\r\n\r\n  No. 0       3/8 inch      No. 1       7/8  inch.\r\n   “  2       1/2   “        “  3       9/16   “\r\n   “  4       5/8   “        “  5      11/16   “\r\n   “  6       3/4   “        “  7      13/16   “\r\n   “  8       7/8   “        “  9      15/16   “\r\n   “ 10     1       “        “ 11     1-1/16   “\r\n   “ 12     1-1/8   “        “ 13     1-3/16   “\r\n   “ 14     1-1/4   “        “ 15     1-5/16   “\r\n   “ 16     1-3/8   “        “ 17     1-7/16   “\r\n   “ 18     1-1/2   “        “ 19     1-9/16   “\r\n   “ 20     1-5/8   “        “ 24     1-7/8    “\r\n   “ 22     1-3/4   “        “ 26     2        “\r\n\r\nLength is generally designated as short, regular, extra long, and the\r\nshape as tapered, or straight.\r\n\r\nThis classification of necessity applies to the trade and gives a size\r\nfor almost any character of work there is, though another general\r\nclassification that is used principally abroad, is as follows:—\r\n\r\n  Thick corks having more than 31 millimeters[36] in diameter.\r\n  Ordinary or commercial, from 25 to 31 millimeters.\r\n  Bastard corks, from 23 to 25 millimeters.\r\n  Thin corks, having less than 23 millimeters.\r\n\r\n  [36] Millimeter = .0394 inch.\r\n\r\nThese classes of sizes are of course divided again and again by the\r\nmanufacturers. To this size classification must be added a quality\r\ndistinction, and this generally takes the same as before described, in\r\nsorting the cork-board, grading down from the best which is tawny or\r\npink in color, with a fine texture, free from cracks, stone cells, or\r\nother blemishes.\r\n\r\nAs has been stated, the punch is now employed in most corkwood\r\nestablishments, but there are still a few who do the work by hand and\r\nmaintain that the best results are obtained in this manner.\r\n\r\nHand-cut corks or stoppers are used mostly for the high-class wine trade\r\nand are a little more expensive than machine cut. There is also a hand\r\nmachine for shaping corks, which consists of a knife, the blade of which\r\nis placed horizontally, joined generally to a piece of wood, to which a\r\nback and forward movement is given similar to that of a carpenter’s\r\nplane. In moving, the knife turns the square cork, or whatever shape it\r\nmay be, by a series of belt attachments, and takes off a strip of cork\r\n(palilla) more or less thick, according to the distance from the axis of\r\nthe cork and the edge of the blade; the principle being the same in the\r\npower machine, if these are parallel the resulting cork will be\r\ncylindrical, and if not, it becomes conical.\r\n\r\nThe standard size stopper is the prime use to which corkwood has been\r\nput, and in the making of it the best material is used; this material\r\ncoming in varying thicknesses, it sometimes is difficult to secure\r\nenough for making “champagnes,” so some manufacturers produce a stopper\r\nthat answers the requirements by fastening two pieces of thin superfine\r\ncorkwood together with a rubber cement made by dissolving pure Para\r\nrubber in disulphide of carbon, which makes a very good binder and not\r\nlessening the quality service to any appreciable degree.\r\n\r\nAfter the corks are cut, the ends are not always as even and as smooth\r\nas desired, so they are taken to a sandpaper wheel which revolves very\r\nrapidly in an upright position, and against this the corks are held for\r\na few seconds until the surface becomes smooth and straight, the dust\r\ncreated being collected and used in various ways. (See “Waste\r\nUtilization.”)\r\n\r\n\r\nCORK-DISK MAKING\r\n\r\n(See “Waste Utilization”)\r\n\r\nSince the Crown Seal stopper, for beer bottles particularly, has come\r\ninto vogue, there has been a great demand for cork disks which form the\r\nmedium for air tightness and this has given the cork-worker an\r\nopportunity to utilize a grade of corkwood that usually had but little\r\ncommercial value, that is, a thin bark.\r\n\r\nIt may be well to state here for the uninitiated that the Crown Seal is\r\nmade up of a tin cap, corrugated on the lapped edge, for gripping the\r\ntop of the bottle, a corkwood disk and a water-proof paper between the\r\ndisk and cap, a very ingenious device.\r\n\r\nAs you have already read in a previous chapter that corks are cut\r\nvertical parallel, or, to state more clearly, the axis of the stopper\r\nmust be parallel with the axis of the tree that furnished the bark; and\r\nthe desired direction is easily recognizable by the colored striae due\r\nto the annual layers of suberous substance that are observed in the\r\ndirection of its axis, this rule being followed because cork is found to\r\nbe more impervious to liquids if cut in this manner. It will be readily\r\nseen that if disks are cut horizontally parallel, that is, the annual\r\nlayers running at right angles to the axis of the disk, this grade of\r\ncork can be utilized to great advantage. The mode of cutting is by a\r\nhorizontal revolving blade, which slices the cork to the desired\r\nthickness, usually a quarter of an inch, and then it follows the usual\r\ncourse of punching, etc. From these operations a great deal of waste\r\naccumulates, and this would be a great loss if methods were not devised\r\nfor its utilization. Many firms work up this waste on the premises, but\r\nmost of it is shipped out and its conversion forms a separate part of\r\nthe corkwood industry, which will be described later. We might say now\r\nthat the cork is made, for it has been cut and shaped into the desired\r\ncommercial size; and all that remains is to sort them and ship them\r\naway. But if commerce desires sizes and quality, it has also exacted\r\nmany other requirements of a cork before it is acceptable and we will\r\nnow take up the further manipulation of cork before it leaves the\r\nfactory. Naturally, this corkwood, coming such a distance and being\r\nhandled by so many in the general processes just described, gets more or\r\nless dirty, and aside from that perhaps in the growing the tissue has\r\nnot remained as white as is desired, so before the cork can leave the\r\nfactory it has to be washed or cleaned. And in this washing I will not\r\nsay that there is not an attempt to improve the looks of the corks in\r\norder to get a better price. Now this washing or bleaching is carried on\r\nin the simplest manner and is just soaking the corks in water and a\r\nchemical and then placing them in a centrifugal spinner, which is\r\nnothing more than a perforated receptacle made to revolve within an iron\r\njacket, which is connected to a drain, naturally forcing the material\r\nagainst the periphery and thereby causing the excess water and acid to\r\npass out through the perforations, this system becoming quite common in\r\ncork factories to-day, greatly facilitating the drying, which is done\r\nmostly by the atmosphere. This is all there is to the mechanical part,\r\nbut curiosity prompts us to inquire what chemicals are used to clean the\r\ncorks, so I have ascertained the principal ones, but of course every\r\nmanufacturer will have his own way of doing this part of the work,\r\nalthough the principle remains the same. An old way was to wash them in\r\nwater containing chloride of tin or oxalic acid and then subjecting them\r\nto the fumes of burning sulphur, but the sulphur bleach has been\r\ndiscontinued. Bioxalate of potash has also been used in solution, as\r\nalso chloride of lime, ammonia and sulphuric acid. Another way is to\r\nwash in a 10 per cent solution of hydrochloric acid and then immerse in\r\na solution of sodium hyposulphate and hydrochloric acid, finally washing\r\nwith a solution of soda and water. All of these produce the desired\r\neffect when mere cleaning and bleaching is all that is required: but in\r\nthe poorer grade of cork, mostly a thick cork that has been jaspered or\r\ncontains micro-organisms, a system of treatment with formol or methylal,\r\nethyl alcohol or spirit wine and formaldehyde and impregnating with\r\ncasein has been used. These bleaches are applied to regular stoppers and\r\ndisks alike, but in addition to this the disks are given a bath of hot\r\nparaffin, or glycerine and paraffin, which improves their resistance and\r\nretards discoloration. This generally being done in a steam-jacketed\r\nkettle, or tumbling barrel, and then placed in a centrifugal to remove\r\nthe excess of water and paraffin.\r\n\r\nIn some factories, and when the customer requests it, the name is\r\nbranded upon the stopper by irons heated by gas, gasolene or in a coal\r\nfire, automatic gas heated machines being most general.\r\n\r\nIn the foregoing it has been shown how the stopper and disk are made,\r\nand although there are many different manufacturers of corkwood\r\nstoppers, it will be found that the _modus operandi_ just described is\r\nfollowed generally, with perhaps a variation in the details. The waste\r\nmaterial, “recortes” as stated is collected and used in various ways,\r\nbut either in conjunction with other materials or alone in a granulated\r\nor powdered state.\r\n\r\nThe following chapter will enumerate the three principal uses of waste\r\ncorkwood, and as these cover the fundamentals of the other uses it will\r\nnot be necessary to describe them, e.g., linoleum, made by mixing\r\ncork-flour and linseed oil.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASTE UTILIZATION\r\n\r\n\r\nIn giving the processes of the methods used in the conversion of the\r\ncorkwood waste and virgin corkwood, which is classed as waste, it will\r\nnot be possible to go too far into the details, as most of them are\r\nsecret, and in justice to those who use them a résumé is all that will\r\nbe incorporated in this monograph. But this will give a good idea and\r\nunderstanding of the utilization, which is all that is intended. As in\r\nthe first processes of corkwood manipulation the best is taken first;\r\nso, in the department of waste utilization, a process is now used\r\nwhereby the best scrap is made into cork disks for the Crown seal as\r\ndescribed, and serves its purpose well.\r\n\r\nThis scrap is taken and granulated in an iron rotary cutter mill, to a\r\ndegree of fineness that will pass a 1/8″ mesh, it is then screened and\r\nmixed with a secret binder that has a wonderful holding quality; it is\r\nthen dried by steam and pressed into sheets by hydraulic presses, dried\r\nagain, and then stamped out in the usual manner. There is no waste to\r\nthis process as the unused portions go back to the grinders again and\r\nthrough the usual process.\r\n\r\nGranulated cork is made by grinding the waste in ordinary metal roller,\r\ncage or bur mills, and then screening same for the various degrees of\r\nfineness; if cork-flour is desired, a tube mill may be used.\r\n\r\nThese two uses are generally confined to the best scrap, but there still\r\nremains a large quantity which has a great value. A portion of this is\r\nmade into Spanish black by carbonizing same in a closed iron kettle, or\r\nretort, and then grinding same in a regulation ball mill, until the\r\ndesired fineness is obtained; this process producing a very fine black.\r\n\r\nThe above uses in no degree exhaust the amount of scrap corkwood that\r\nleaves the various factories here and abroad, nor is its usefulness\r\nexpended, for there is one use to which cork scrap is being put that\r\nbids fair to rival the stopper industry in importance, and that is in\r\nthe form of cork-board for insulating purposes.\r\n\r\nThe processes for the making of cork-board differ in many ways, widely\r\ndivergent in principle. The corkwood waste and virgin cork are broken up\r\nand chipped in an ordinary iron mill as a preliminary to all processes;\r\nin one, claimed to be the best, this chipped material is poured into\r\niron molds the desired shape of the slab, subjected to heavy pressure\r\nand run into an oven kept at about 800 to 900 degrees Fahrenheit. This\r\noven, being a low brick type, resembling a lear and heated by coal\r\nfires, the slab molds being drawn through on an endless chain, which\r\nruns at a speed to keep the cork in just long enough, for the resin in\r\nsame to exude and bind the little particles together; the cork is also\r\ncharred in this process, thereby converting it into a carbonized\r\ncellulose which makes it an excellent material for insulation.\r\nSteam-heated hydraulic presses are also used for making small tile,\r\netc., being the same principle as above, without the charring.\r\n\r\nThe other process involves the use of tar, pitch or asphaltum, as a\r\nbinder for the cork particles, and in one, the cork is mixed with a clay\r\nbefore being mixed with the asphaltum. The binder being heated in steam\r\njacketed kettles, and in one it is mixed in the proportion of one to\r\nfour, while in the other it is forced into the mass under pressure and\r\nthen drawn out again by vacuum, both mixtures being poured into molds of\r\nthe desired shape of the slab or in large molds, to be cut up after, and\r\nsubjected to heavy pressure, the sawing being done by an ordinary\r\nrip-saw, cutting the block into any desired thickness of slab.\r\n\r\nThe above described processes do not include all of the various\r\nmanipulations of corkwood, for there are innumerable things as stated\r\nunder the “Uses” for which there is a necessity of mechanical operation,\r\nin their making; but the general processes are as stated and will cover\r\nmost all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXTENT OF THE MANUFACTURING INDUSTRY\r\n\r\n\r\nThe cork stopper industry had its permanent origin in Spain, in the\r\nProvince of Gerona, town of Llacostera, towards the latter part of 1750\r\nand was contemporaneous with the inception of the glass bottle, although\r\ncorkwood was used many years before as a stopper for amphora, etc., as\r\nnoted in a previous chapter.\r\n\r\nThe trade flourished there until wars and schisms rent the country and\r\ndrove the industry to the mountains. There it slumbered and struggled\r\nfor many years until the peace was restored and the people assured that\r\nthe dangers were passed. Its revival was not very sudden, but slowly and\r\nsurely it grew, and won itself a place in the trade life of Spain and\r\nfinally became a necessity, so much so, that it began to attract\r\nattention and other countries sought to secure the secret. About 1828\r\nthe French agents at Catalonia found enough information to warrant them\r\nreturning to France and there set up for themselves, the rivalry between\r\nthe two becoming very keen, causing much excitement among the Spanish\r\nmanufacturers; for up to that time they monopolized the trade and had a\r\nnice time of it. This lasted until 1849, when the trade assumed such\r\nproportions that both had all they could attend to and more. This\r\ninsured a steady increase of the trade, and before long it assumed\r\nproportions that has surpassed the dreams of its founders. The industry\r\nspread until the raw material began to show a shortage due to the heavy\r\ndemands made upon it. More frequent cuttings were compulsory to supply\r\nthe market, and in consequence the grade became poorer.\r\n\r\nThe realization of this caused the Spanish Government to step in and\r\nprotect the forests as a national necessity, and the result was the\r\npassing of laws to govern the cutting of corkwood from the trees. But\r\nthe trade kept on growing in other countries and the raw stock was in\r\ngreat demand.\r\n\r\nThe result of the heavy exportation of corkwood again caused some\r\nnotable alarm among the manufacturers and trades-workers in Spain and\r\nPortugal, but principally in the former, as most of the largest factories\r\nare located in its cities; so that the principal representatives of the\r\ncork industry convened at Madrid in December of 1911, at which\r\nconvention resolutions were passed to urge upon the Government the\r\nnecessity of imposing an export tax or duty on corkwood ranging from\r\nfive to fifty gold pesetas ($.0965 to $9.65) per 100 kilos (220 pounds).\r\nBy so doing it was thought to remedy the shortage in the home market.\r\n\r\nThe competition between the foreign and Spanish buyers for the raw\r\ncorkwood output was largely in favor of the foreigner in 1911, owing to\r\nthe unprotective export duties, and the result has been that the once\r\nflourishing national industry is now very badly handicapped for want of\r\nworking material.\r\n\r\nSo simultaneously with the tariff revision, which went into effect on\r\nJanuary 1, 1912, an endeavor was made to put in force the increase on\r\nexport corkwood, but owing to the efforts of the American cork\r\nmanufacturers, who have a great influence over the Spanish cork\r\nindustry, the proposed increase did not meet with the desired success.\r\n\r\nIn the attempt to restrict the importation of raw material the Spaniards\r\nhave failed, for its usefulness makes the demand too great and the\r\nforeigners have invaded the Iberian Peninsula and are now buying up even\r\nthe raw stock on the trees. The corkwood markets are no longer confined\r\nto two or three, but extend round the world, the principal ones being:\r\nLondon, Paris, Rheims, Epernay, Maguncia, Dresden, New York, Pittsburgh,\r\nSan Francisco, Buenos Ayres, Calcutta, Sydney, Melbourne and Yeddo. So\r\nit will be seen that a great demand is being made upon the forests,\r\nwhich must be cultivated for increased growth and production or an early\r\ninvestigation made for the growing of the trees in other countries.\r\n\r\nOf course the industry remains very strong throughout Spain and\r\nPortugal, and particularly in the Andalusia District of Spain, where the\r\nmanufacturing establishments play an important part in converting the\r\ncorkwood into useful articles of commerce. The Spanish yield of raw\r\nmaterial has remained slightly behind Portugal, but this does not affect\r\nthe former’s influence in the trade. (See Appendix.)\r\n\r\nIt is inevitable that the greatest bulk of the trade should center\r\naround the countries in which the raw material is grown, for the\r\ngreatest advantage is thus gained by those, so fortunate in their\r\nlocation.\r\n\r\nBut the spread of the corkwood’s fame has aroused others to action, and\r\nit appears as though the monopoly will suffer because of that fame. The\r\ndemand grows daily, and the rapid growth of the American trade bids fair\r\nto being a very close rival to the long-established European\r\nmanufactures at least.\r\n\r\nThe waste is rapidly assuming great importance and to this the newer\r\nentrant in the business is turning all his energy. The doctrine of\r\nconservation and utilization has been heeded by the corkwood industry\r\nand the waste is no longer such, rather standing as a cork product\r\nsecond only to the stopper, when the fact is considered that the grower\r\nor farmer receives about $58 per ton for raw corkwood and the waste\r\nsells from $22 to $32 per ton; its value is apparent.\r\n\r\nA notable feature of the shipments from Spain is the waste and shavings,\r\nwhich doubled from 1906 to 1910, viz.:\r\n\r\n  1906 — 14,624 tons\r\n  1907 — 17,557  “\r\n  1908 — 12,201  “\r\n  1909 — 20,198  “\r\n  1910 — 29,257  “\r\n\r\nThe uses to which corkwood may be put are unlimited, and as has been\r\nseen the uses already known are sufficient, in themselves, to make it a\r\nvery important commodity. And yet when we speak of uses it is only those\r\nthat have developed by reason of the corkwood’s own peculiarity that\r\nmakes it the subject of discussion, and not the great number that it has\r\nbeen adapted to, for perhaps its utility will have no end, and in my\r\nestimation its particular qualities are but little appreciated. Of\r\ncourse its application as a stopper is ideal for that purpose, but it\r\nappears most certain that this wonderful growth is designed to be of\r\ngreater service to man than the mere function of filling the neck of a\r\nbottle. Chemically, I think it has possibilities; the ancients found it\r\nuseful in Materia Medica, and there may still be a use in this line. At\r\nany rate, it is the most wonderful bark of its kind, its service has\r\nbeen a long one, and its benefits, even as a stopper, have been many. A\r\nwonderful material truly, and of interest, so full that it seems I have\r\nfailed to do it justice in these few words presented in my endeavor to\r\ndescribe the Quercus Suber of Linnæus.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX\r\n\r\n\r\nFor those who may be interested in a few statistics of the trade is\r\nappended the following figures relating to the Spanish and American\r\nindustry:\r\n\r\nSPANISH INDUSTRY, 1912\r\n\r\nThere were 892 factories throughout Spain in 1912, in 107 towns and\r\ncities, divided as follows:\r\n\r\n  Seville District       305 in 48 towns\r\n  Barcelona District     507 in 31   “\r\n  Other Districts         80 in 28   “\r\n\r\nThese factories employ approximately 40,000 people in the various\r\nbranches of the industry at an average daily wage of 67 cents.\r\n\r\nThe raw material yield for 1912 is reported as: 7800 short tons, valued\r\nat $57.90 per ton to the grower, or $4,516,200.\r\n\r\nIt will also be of interest to show a few comparisons of values, for\r\nvarious years, in shipments to foreign parts, viz.:\r\n\r\n                              1909\r\n

states: New York (Brooklyn), Pennsylvania,\r\nNew Jersey, Illinois, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Wisconsin and Ohio.\r\nEmploying 2340 wage earners. Importing a raw stock of $2,404,000, and\r\nmaking products valued at $4,392,000.\r\n\r\nIn 1904, the factories decreased to 50 in number, the wage earners\r\nincreased to 2895, the imported raw material to $2,459,197 and the\r\nproducts to $4,490,952.\r\n\r\nIn 1909, the factories increasing again to 62 in number, the wage\r\nearners to 3142, the imported raw material to $3,435,000 and the\r\nproducts to $5,940,000: corks selling from 3 cents to 40 cents per\r\npound.\r\n\r\nThis of course does not appear to be a very extensive business, but the\r\nnature of the commodity will readily convince that the money figures are\r\nnot at all in comparison to the bulk of corkwood, for it would really\r\nseem that if the trade should increase to an amount sufficient to vie\r\nwith other prominent ones, the ships would be at loss how to stow the\r\nother freight.
