C. M. G.\r\nPREMIER OF CANADA\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat young man of our race would not gladly give a year of his life\r\nto roll backward the scroll of time for five decades and live that\r\nyear in the romantic bygone-days of the Wild West; to see the great\r\nMissouri while the Buffalo pastured on its banks, while big game\r\nteemed in sight and the red man roamed and hunted, unchecked by\r\nfence or hint of white man's rule; or, when that rule was represented\r\nonly by scattered trading-posts, hundreds of miles apart, and\r\nat best the traders could exchange the news by horse or canoe and\r\nmonths of lonely travel?\r\n\r\nI for one, would have rejoiced in tenfold payment for the privilege\r\nof this backward look in our age, and had reached the middle life\r\nbefore I realised that, at a much less heavy cost, the miracle was\r\npossible today.\r\n\r\nFor the uncivilised Indian still roams the far reaches of absolutely\r\nunchanged, unbroken forest and prairie leagues, and has knowledge\r\nof white men only in bartering furs at the scattered trading-posts,\r\nwhere locomotive and telegraph are unknown; still the wild Buffalo\r\nelude the hunters, fight the Wolves, wallow, wander, and breed;\r\nand still there is hoofed game by the million to be found where the\r\nSaxon is as seldom seen as on the Missouri in the times of Lewis\r\nand Clarke. Only we must seek it all, not in the West, but in the\r\nfar North-west; and for \"Missouri and Mississippi\" read \"Peace and\r\nMackenzie Rivers,\" those noble streams that northward roll their\r\nmile-wide turbid floods a thousand leagues to the silent Arctic\r\nSea.\r\n\r\nThis was the thought which spurred me to a six months' journey\r\nby canoe. And I found what I went in search of, but found, also,\r\nabundant and better rewards that were not in mind, even as Saul,\r\nthe son of Kish, went seeking asses and found for himself a crown\r\nand a great kingdom.\r\n\r\nFour years have gone by since I lived through these experiences.\r\nSuch a lapse of time may have made my news grow stale, but it has\r\nalso given the opportunity for the working up of specimens and\r\nscientific records. The results, for the most part, will be found\r\nin the Appendices, and three of these, as indicated--namely, the\r\nsections on Plants, Mammals, and Birds--are the joint work of my\r\nassistant, Mr. Edward A. Preble, and myself.\r\n\r\nMy thanks are due here to the Right Honourable Lord Strathcona, G.\r\nC. M. G., Governor of the Hudson's Bay Company, for giving me access\r\nto the records of the Company whenever I needed them for historical\r\npurposes; to the Honourable Frank Oliver, Minister of the Interior,\r\nCanada, for the necessary papers and permits to facilitate scientific\r\ncollection, and also to Clarence C. Chipman, Esq., of Winnipeg,\r\nthe Hudson's Bay Company's Commissioner, for practical help in\r\npreparing my outfit, and for letters of introduction to the many\r\nofficers of the Company, whose kind help was so often a Godsend.\r\n\r\nERNEST THOMPSON SETON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\nDEPARTURE FOR THE NORTH\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 1907 I set out to journey by canoe down the Athabaska and adjoining\r\nwaters to the sole remaining forest wilds--the far north-west of\r\nCanada--and the yet more desert Arctic Plains, where still, it was\r\nsaid, were to be seen the Caribou in their primitive condition.\r\n\r\nMy only companion was Edward A. Preble, of Washington, D. C., a\r\ntrained naturalist,--an expert canoeist and traveller, and a man\r\nof three seasons' experience in the Hudson's Bay Territory and the\r\nMackenzie Valley. While my chief object was to see the Caribou,\r\nand prove their continued abundance, I was prepared incidentally\r\nto gather natural-history material of all kinds, and to complete\r\nthe shore line of the ambiguous lake called \"Aylmer,\" as well as\r\nexplore its sister, the better-known Clinton-Colden.\r\n\r\nI went for my own pleasure at my own expense, and yet I could not\r\npersuade my Hudson's Bay Company friends that I was not sent by\r\nsome government, museum or society for some secret purpose.\r\n\r\nOn the night of May 5 we left Winnipeg, and our observations began\r\nwith the day at Brandon.\r\n\r\nFrom that point westward to Regina we saw abundant evidence that\r\nlast year had been a \"rabbit year,\" that is, a year in which the\r\never-fluctuating population of Northern Hares (Snowshoe-rabbits\r\nor White-rabbits) had reached its maximum, for nine-tenths of the\r\nbushes in sight from the train had been barked at the snow level.\r\nBut the fact that we saw not one Rabbit shows that \"the plague\" had\r\nappeared, had run its usual drastic course, and nearly exterminated\r\nthe species in this particular region.\r\n\r\nEarly next morning at Kininvie (40 miles west of Medicine Hat,\r\nAlberta) we saw a band of 4 Antelope south of the track; later\r\nwe saw others all along as far as Gleichen. All were south of the\r\ntrack. The bands contained as follows: 4, 14, 18, 8, 12, 8, 4, 1,\r\n4, 5, 4, 6, 4, 18, 2, 6, 34, 6, 3, 1, 10, 25, 16, 3, 7, 9 (almost\r\nnever 2, probably because this species does not pair), or 232\r\nAntelope in 26 bands along 70 miles of track; but all were on the\r\nsouth side; not one was noted on the north.\r\n\r\nThe case is simple. During the past winter, while the Antelope were\r\ngone southward, the Canadian Pacific Railway Company had fenced its\r\ntrack. In spring the migrants, returning, found themselves cut off\r\nfrom their summer feeding-grounds by those impassable barb-wires, and\r\nso were gathered against the barrier. One band of 8, at a stopping\r\nplace, ran off when they saw passengers alighting, but at half a\r\nmile they turned, and again came up against the fence, showing how\r\nstrong is the northward impulse.\r\n\r\nUnless they learn some way of mastering the difficulty, it means\r\nextermination for the Antelope of the north Saskatchewan.\r\n\r\nFrom Calgary we went by train to Edmonton. This is the point\r\nof leaving the railway, the beginning of hard travel, and here we\r\nwaited a few days to gather together our various shipments of food\r\nand equipment, and to await notice that the river was open.\r\n\r\nIn the north the grand event of the year is the opening of the\r\nrivers. The day when the ice goes out is the official first day\r\nof spring, the beginning of the season; and is eagerly looked for,\r\nas every day's delay means serious loss to the traders, whose men\r\nare idle, but drawing pay as though at work.\r\n\r\nOn May 11, having learned that the Athabaska was open, we left\r\nEdmonton in a livery rig, and drove 94 miles northward though a most\r\npromising, half-settled country, and late the next day arrived at\r\nAthabaska Landing, on the great east tributary of the Mackenzie,\r\nwhose waters were to bear us onward for so many weeks.\r\n\r\nAthabaska Landing is a typical frontier town. These are hard words,\r\nbut justified. We put up at the principal hotel; the other lodgers\r\ntold me it was considered the worst hotel in the world. I thought\r\nI knew of two worse, but next morning accepted the prevailing view.\r\n\r\nOur canoe and provisions arrived, but the great convoy of scows\r\nthat were to take the annual supplies of trade stuff for the far\r\nnorth was not ready, and we needed the help and guidance of its\r\nmen, so must needs wait for four days.\r\n\r\nThis gave us the opportunity to study the local natural history\r\nand do a little collecting, the results of which appear later.\r\n\r\nThe great size of the timber here impressed me. I measured a typical\r\nblack poplar (P. balsamifera), 100 feet to the top, 8 feet 2 inches\r\nin circumference, at 18 inches from the ground, and I saw many\r\nthicker, but none taller.\r\n\r\nAt the hotel, also awaiting the scows, was a body of four\r\n(dis-)Mounted Police, bound like ourselves for the far north. The\r\nofficer in charge turned out to be an old friend from Toronto, Major\r\nA. M. Jarvis. I also met John Schott, the gigantic half-breed, who\r\nwent to the Barren Grounds with Caspar Whitney in 1895. He seemed\r\nto have great respect for Whitney as a tramper, and talked much of\r\nthe trip, evidently having forgotten his own shortcomings of the\r\ntime. While I sketched his portrait, he regaled me with memories\r\nof his early days on Red River, where he was born in 1841. 1 did\r\nnot fail to make what notes I could of those now historic times.\r\nHis accounts of the Antelope on White Horse Plain, in 1855, and\r\nBuffalo about the site of Carberry, Manitoba, in 1852, were new\r\nand valuable light on the ancient ranges of these passing creatures.\r\n\r\nAll travellers who had preceded me into the Barren Grounds had\r\nrelied on the abundant game, and in consequence suffered dreadful\r\nhardships; in some cases even starved to death. I proposed to rely\r\non no game, but to take plenty of groceries, the best I could buy\r\nin Winnipeg, which means the best in the world; and, as will be\r\nseen later, the game, because I was not relying on it, walked into\r\ncamp every day.\r\n\r\nBut one canoe could not carry all these provisions, so most of it\r\nI shipped on the Hudson's Bay Company scows, taking with us, in\r\nthe canoe, food for not more than a week, which with camp outfit\r\nwas just enough for ballast.\r\n\r\nOf course I was in close touch with the Hudson's Bay people. Although\r\nnominally that great trading company parted with its autocratic\r\npower and exclusive franchise in 1870, it is still the sovereign\r\nof the north. And here let me correct an error that is sometimes\r\nfound even in respectable print--the Company has at all times been\r\nready to assist scientists to the utmost of its very ample power.\r\nAlthough jealous of its trading rights, every one is free to enter\r\nthe territory without taking count of the Company, but there has\r\nnot yet been a successful scientific expedition into the region\r\nwithout its active co-operation.\r\n\r\nThe Hudson's Bay Company has always been the guardian angel of the\r\nnorth.\r\n\r\nI suppose that there never yet was another purely commercial concern\r\nthat so fully realized the moral obligations of its great power,\r\nor that has so uniformly done its best for the people it ruled.\r\n\r\nAt all times it has stood for peace, and one hears over and over\r\nagain that such and such tribes were deadly enemies, but the Company\r\ninsisted on their smoking the peace pipe. The Sioux and Ojibway,\r\nBlack-Foot and Assiniboine., Dog-Rib and Copper-Knife, Beaver and\r\nChipewyan, all offer historic illustrations in point, and many\r\nothers could be found for the list.\r\n\r\nThe name Peace River itself is the monument of a successful effort\r\non the part of the Company to bring about a better understanding\r\nbetween the Crees and the Beavers.\r\n\r\nBesides human foes, the Company has saved the Indian from famine and\r\nplague. Many a hunger-stricken tribe owes its continued existence\r\nto the fatherly care of the Company, not simply general and\r\nindiscriminate, but minute and personal, carried into the details\r\nof their lives. For instance, when bots so pestered the Caribou of\r\none region as to render their hides useless to the natives, the\r\nCompany brought in hides from a district where they still were\r\ngood.\r\n\r\nThe Chipewyans were each spring the victims of snow-blindness until\r\nthe Company brought and succeeded in popularizing their present\r\nugly but effectual and universal peaked hats. When their train-dogs\r\nwere running down in physique, the Company brought in a strain of\r\npure Huskies or Eskimo. When the Albany River Indians were starving\r\nand unable to hunt, the Company gave the order for 5,000 lodge poles.\r\nThen, not knowing how else to turn them to account, commissioned\r\nthe Indians to work them into a picket garden-fence. At all times\r\nthe native found a father in the Company, and it was the worst thing\r\nthat ever happened the region when the irresponsible free-traders\r\nwith their demoralizing methods were allowed to enter and traffic\r\nwhere or how they pleased.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nDOWN THE NOISY RIVER WITH THE VOYAGEURS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAt Athabaska Landing, on May 18, 1907, 10.15 A. M., we boarded the\r\nsuperb Peterborough canoe that I had christened the Ann Seton. The\r\nAthabaska River was a-flood and clear of ice; 13 scows of freight,\r\nwith 60 half-breeds and Indians to man them, left at the same time,\r\nand in spite of a strong headwind we drifted northward fully 31\r\nmiles an hour.\r\n\r\nThe leading scow, where I spent some time, was in charge of John\r\nMacDonald himself, and his passengers comprised the Hudson's Bay\r\nCompany officials, going to their posts or on tours of inspection.\r\nThey were a jolly crowd, like a lot of rollicking schoolboys,\r\nfull of fun and good-humour, chaffing and joking all day; but when\r\na question of business came up, the serious businessman appeared\r\nin each, and the Company's interest was cared for with their best\r\npowers. The bottle was not entirely absent in these scow fraternities,\r\nbut I saw no one the worse for liquor on the trip.\r\n\r\nThe men of mixed blood jabbered in French, Cree, and Chipewyan\r\nchiefly, but when they wanted to swear, they felt the inadequacy\r\nof these mellifluous or lisping tongues, and fell back on virile\r\nSaxon, whose tang, projectivity, and wealth of vile epithet\r\nevidently supplied a long-felt want in the Great Lone Land of the\r\nDog and Canoe.\r\n\r\nIn the afternoon Preble and I pushed on in our boat, far in advance\r\nof the brigade. As we made early supper I received for the twentieth\r\ntime a lesson in photography. A cock Partridge or Ruffed Grouse\r\ncame and drummed on a log in open view, full sunlight, fifty feet\r\naway. I went quietly to the place. He walked off, but little alarmed.\r\nI set the camera eight feet from the log, with twenty-five feet of\r\ntubing, and retired to a good hiding-place. But alas! I put the\r\ntube on the left-hand pump, not knowing that that was a dummy.\r\nThe Grouse came back in three minutes, drumming in a superb pose\r\nsquarely in front of the camera. I used the pump, but saw that it\r\nfailed to operate; on going forward the Grouse skimmed away and\r\nreturned no more. Preble said, \"Never mind; there will be another\r\nevery hundred yards all the way down the river, later on.\" I could\r\nonly reply, \"The chance never comes but once,\" and so it proved.\r\nWe heard Grouse drumming many times afterward, but the sun was low,\r\nor the places densely shaded, or the mosquitoes made conditions\r\nimpossible for silent watching; the perfect chance came but once,\r\nas it always does, and I lost it.\r\n\r\nAbout twenty miles below the Landing we found the abandoned winter\r\nhut of a trapper; on the roof were the dried up bodies of 1 Skunk,\r\n2 Foxes, and 30 Lynxes, besides the bones of 2 Moose, showing the\r\nnature of the wild life about.\r\n\r\nThat night, as the river was brimming and safe, we tied up to the\r\nscows and drifted, making 30 more miles, or 60 since embarking.\r\n\r\nIn the early morning, I was much struck by the lifelessness of the\r\nscene. The great river stretched away northward, the hills rose\r\nabruptly from the water's edge, everywhere extended the superb\r\nspruce forest, here fortunately unburnt; but there seemed no sign of\r\nliving creature outside of our own numerous, noisy, and picturesque\r\nparty. River, hills, and woods were calm and silent. It was\r\nimpressive, if disappointing; and, when at last the fir stillness\r\nwas broken by a succession of trumpet notes from the Great Pileated\r\nWoodpecker, the sound went rolling on and on, in reverberating\r\nechoes that might well have alarmed the bird himself.\r\n\r\nThe white spruce forest along the banks is most inspiring, magnificent\r\nhere. Down the terraced slopes and right to the water's edge on the\r\nalluvial soil it stands in ranks. Each year, of course, the floods\r\nundercut the banks, and more trees fall, to become at last the\r\nflotsam of the shore a thousand miles away.\r\n\r\nThere is something sad about these stately trees, densely packed,\r\nall a-row, unflinching, hopelessly awaiting the onset of the\r\ninexorable, invincible river. One group, somewhat isolated and\r\nformal, was a forest life parallel to Lady Butler's famous \"Roll\r\nCall of the Grenadiers.\"\r\n\r\nAt night we reached the Indian village of Pelican Portage, and\r\nlanded by climbing over huge blocks of ice that were piled along\r\nthe shore. The adult male inhabitants came down to our camp, so\r\nthat the village was deserted, except for the children and a few\r\nwomen.\r\n\r\nAs I walked down the crooked trail along which straggle the cabins,\r\nI saw something white in a tree at the far end. Supposing it to be\r\na White-rabbit in a snare, I went near and found, to my surprise,\r\nfirst that it was a dead house-cat, a rare species here; second,\r\nunder it, eyeing it and me alternately, was a hungry-looking Lynx.\r\nI had a camera, for it was near sundown, and in the woods, so I\r\nwent back to the boat and returned with a gun. There was the Lynx\r\nstill prowling, but now farther from the village. I do not believe\r\nhe would have harmed the children, but a Lynx is game. I fired,\r\nand he fell without a quiver or a sound. This was the first time\r\nI had used a gun in many years, and was the only time on the trip.\r\nI felt rather guilty, but the carcass was a godsend to two old\r\nIndians who were sickening on a long diet of salt pork, and that\r\nLynx furnished them tender meat for three days afterward; while\r\nits skin and skull went to the American Museum.\r\n\r\nOn the night of May 20, we camped just above Grand Rapids--Preble\r\nand I alone, for the first time, under canvas, and glad indeed\r\nto get away from the noisy rabble of the boatmen, though now they\r\nwere but a quarter mile off. At first I had found them amusing\r\nand picturesque, but their many unpleasant habits, their distinct\r\naversion to strangers, their greediness to get all they could out\r\nof one, and do nothing in return, combined finally with their habit\r\nof gambling all night to the loud beating of a tin pan, made me\r\nthankful to quit their company for a time.\r\n\r\nAt Grand Rapids the scows were unloaded, the goods shipped over\r\na quarter-mile hand tramway, on an island, the scows taken down a\r\nside channel, one by one, and reloaded. This meant a delay of three\r\nor four days, during which we camped on the island and gathered\r\nspecimens.\r\n\r\nBeing the organizer, equipper, geographer, artist, head, and tail of\r\nthe expedition, I was, perforce, also its doctor. Equipped with a\r\n\"pill-kit,\" an abundance of blisters and bandages and some \"potent\r\npurgatives,\" I had prepared myself to render first and last aid to\r\nthe hurt in my own party. In taking instructions from our family\r\nphysician, I had learned the value of a profound air of great\r\ngravity, a noble reticence, and a total absence of doubt, when I\r\ndid speak. I compressed his creed into a single phrase: \"In case of\r\ndoubt, look wise and work on his 'bowels.'\" This simple equipment\r\nsoon gave me a surprisingly high standing among the men. I was\r\na medicine man of repute, and soon had a larger practice than I\r\ndesired, as it was entirely gratuitous.\r\n\r\nThe various boatmen, Indians and half-breeds, came with their\r\ntroubles, and, thanks chiefly to their faith, were cured. But one\r\nday John MacDonald, the chief pilot and a mighty man on the river,\r\ncame to my tent on Grand Island. John complained that he couldn't\r\nhold anything on his stomach; he was a total peristaltic wreck indeed\r\n(my words; his were more simple and more vivid, but less sonorous\r\nand professional). He said he had been going down hill for two\r\nweeks, and was so bad now that he was \"no better than a couple of\r\nordinary men.\"\r\n\r\n\"Exactly so,\" I said. \"Now you take these pills and you'll be all\r\nright in the morning.\" Next morning John was back, and complained\r\nthat my pills had no effect; he wanted to feel something take hold\r\nof him. Hadn't 1 any pepper-juice or brandy?\r\n\r\nI do not take liquor on an expedition, but at the last moment\r\na Winnipeg friend had given me a pint flask of pure brandy--\"for\r\nemergencies.\" An emergency had come.\r\n\r\n\"John! you shall have some extra fine brandy, nicely thinned with\r\npepper-juice.\" I poured half an inch of brandy into a tin cup, then\r\nadded half an inch of \"pain-killer.\"\r\n\r\n\"Here, take this, and if you don't feel it, it means your insides\r\nare dead, and you may as well order your coffin.\"\r\n\r\nJohn took it at a gulp. His insides were not dead; but I might have\r\nbeen, had I been one of his boatmen.\r\n\r\nHe doubled up, rolled around, and danced for five minutes. He did\r\nnot squeal--John never squeals--but he suffered some, and an hour\r\nlater announced that he was about cured.\r\n\r\nNext day he came to say he was all right, and would soon again be\r\nas good as half a dozen men.\r\n\r\nAt this same camp in Grand Rapids another cure on a much larger\r\nscale was added to my list. An Indian had \"the bones of his foot\r\nbroken,\" crushed by a heavy weight, and was badly crippled. He\r\ncame leaning on a friend's shoulder. His foot was blackened and much\r\nswollen, but I soon satisfied myself that no bones were broken,\r\nbecause he could wriggle all the toes and move the foot in any\r\ndirection.\r\n\r\n\"You'll be better in three days and all right in a week,\" I said,\r\nwith calm assurance. Then I began with massage. It seemed necessary\r\nin the Indian environment to hum some tune, and I found that the\r\n\"Koochy-Koochy\" lent itself best to the motion, so it became my\r\nmedicine song.\r\n\r\nWith many \"Koochy-Koochy\"-ings and much ice-cold water he was\r\nnearly cured in three days, and sound again in a week. But in the\r\nnorth folk have a habit (not known elsewhere) of improving the\r\nincident. Very soon it was known all along the river that the Indian's\r\nleg was broken, and I had set and healed it in three days. In a\r\nyear or two, I doubt not, it will be his neck that was broken, not\r\nonce, but in several places.\r\n\r\nGrand Island yielded a great many Deermice of the arctic form, a\r\nfew Red-backed Voles, and any number of small birds migrant.\r\n\r\nAs we floated down the river the eye was continually held by tall\r\nand prominent spruce trees that had been cut into peculiar forms\r\nas below. These were known as \"lob-sticks,\" or \"lop-sticks,\" and\r\nare usually the monuments of some distinguished visitor in the\r\ncountry or records of some heroic achievement. Thus, one would be\r\npointed out as Commissioner Wrigley's lob-stick, another as John\r\nMacDonald's the time he saved the scow.\r\n\r\nThe inauguration of a lob-stick is quite a ceremony. Some person\r\nin camp has impressed all with his importance or other claim to\r\nnotice. The men, having talked it over, announce that they have\r\ndecided on giving him a lob-stick. \"Will he make choice of some\r\nprominent tree in view?\" The visitor usually selects one back from\r\nthe water's edge, often on some far hilltop, the more prominent the\r\nbetter; then an active young fellow is sent up with an axe to trim\r\nthe tree. The more embellishment the higher the honor. On the trunk\r\nthey then inscribe the name of the stranger, and he is supposed\r\nto give each of the men a plug of tobacco and a drink of whiskey.\r\nThus they celebrate the man and his monument, and ever afterwards\r\nit is pointed out as \"So-and-so's lob-stick.\"\r\n\r\nIt was two months before my men judged that I was entitled to a\r\nlob-stick. We were then on Great Slave Lake where the timber was\r\nsmall, but the best they could get on a small island was chosen\r\nand trimmed into a monument. They were disappointed however, to\r\nfind that I would by no means give whiskey to natives, and my treat\r\nhad to take a wholly different form.\r\n\r\nGrand Rapids, with its multiplicity of perfectly round pot-hole\r\nboulders, was passed in four days, and then, again in company with\r\nthe boats, we entered the real canyon of the river.\r\n\r\nDown Athabaska's boiling flood\r\nOf seething, leaping, coiling mud.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nHUMAN NATURE ON THE RIVER\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSunday morning, 26th of May, there was something like a strike\r\namong the sixty half-breeds and Indians that composed the crews.\r\nThey were strict Sabbatarians (when it suited them); they believed\r\nthat they should do no work, but give up the day to gambling and\r\ndrinking. Old John, the chief pilot, wished to take advantage of the\r\nfine flood on the changing river, and drift down at least to the\r\nhead of the Boiler Rapids, twenty miles away, The breeds maintained,\r\nwith many white swear words, for lack of strong talk in Indian, that\r\nthey never yet knew Sunday work to end in anything but disaster,\r\nand they sullenly scattered among the trees, produced their cards,\r\nand proceeded to gamble away their property, next year's pay,\r\nclothes, families, anything, and otherwise show their respect for\r\nthe Lord's Day and defiance of old John MacDonald. John made no\r\nreply to their arguments; he merely boarded the cook's boat, and\r\npushed off into the swift stream with the cooks and all the grub.\r\nIn five minutes the strikers were on the twelve big boats doing\r\ntheir best to live up to orders. John said nothing, and grinned at\r\nme only with his eyes.\r\n\r\nThe breeds took their defeat in good part after the first minute,\r\nand their commander rose higher in their respect.\r\n\r\nAt noon we camped above the Boiler Rapids. In the evening I climbed\r\nthe 400- or 500-foot hill behind camp and sketched the canyon\r\nlooking northward. The spring birds were now beginning to arrive,\r\nbut were said to be a month late this year. The ground was everywhere\r\nmarked with moose sign; prospects, were brightening.\r\n\r\nThe mania for killing that is seen in many white men is evidently\r\na relic of savagery, for all of these Indians and half-breeds\r\nare full of it. Each carries a rifle, and every living thing that\r\nappears on the banks or on the water is fusilladed with Winchesters\r\nuntil it is dead or out of sight. This explains why we see so\r\nlittle from the scows. One should be at least a day ahead of them\r\nto meet with wild life on the river.\r\n\r\nThis morning two Bears appeared on the high bank--and there was the\r\nusual uproar and fusillading; so far as could be learned without\r\nany effect, except the expenditure of thirty or forty cartridges\r\nat five cents each.\r\n\r\nOn the 27th we came to the Cascade Rapids. The first or Little\r\nCascade has about two feet fall, the second or Grand Cascade, a\r\nmile farther, is about a six foot sheer drop. These are considered\r\nvery difficult to run, and the manner of doing it changes with\r\nevery change in season or water level.\r\n\r\nWe therefore went through an important ceremony, always carried\r\nout in the same way. All 13 boats were beached, the 13 pilots went\r\nahead on the bank to study the problem, they decided on the one\r\nsafe place and manner, then returned, and each of the 13 boats was\r\nrun over in 13 different places and manners. They always do this.\r\nYou are supposed to have run the Cascades successfully if you cross\r\nthem alive, but to have failed if you drown.. In this case all were\r\nsuccessful.\r\n\r\nBelow the Cascades I had a sample of Indian gratitude that set me\r\nthinking. My success with John MacDonald and others had added the\r\nwhole community to my medical practice, for those who were not\r\nsick thought they were. I cheerfully did my best for all, and was\r\nsupposed to be persona grata. Just below the Cascade Rapids was\r\na famous sucker pool, and after we had camped three Indians came,\r\nsaying that the pool was full of suckers--would I lend them my\r\ncanoe to get some?\r\n\r\nAway they went, and from afar I was horrified to see them clubbing\r\nthe fish with my beautiful thin-bladed maple paddles. They returned\r\nwith a boat load of 3- and 4-pound Suckers (Catostomus) and 2\r\npaddles broken. Each of their friends came and received one or two\r\nfine fish, for there were plenty. I, presumably part owner of the\r\ncatch, since I owned the boat, selected one small one for myself,\r\nwhereupon the Indian insolently demanded 25 cents for it; and\r\nthese were the men I had been freely doctoring for two weeks! Not\r\nto speak of the loaned canoe and broken paddles! Then did I say a\r\nfew things to all and sundry--stinging, biting things, ungainsayable\r\nand forcible things--and took possession of all the fish that were\r\nleft, so the Indians slunk off in sullen silence.\r\n\r\nGratitude seems an unknown feeling among these folk; you may give\r\npresents and help and feed them all you like, the moment you want\r\na slight favour of them they demand the uttermost cent. In attempting\r\nto analyse this I was confronted by the fact that among themselves\r\nthey are kind and hospitable, and at length discovered that their\r\nattitude toward us is founded on the ideas that all white men are\r\nvery rich, that the Indian has made them so by allowing them to\r\ncome into this country, that the Indian is very poor because he\r\nnever was properly compensated, and that therefore all he can get\r\nout of said white man is much less than the white man owes him.\r\n\r\nAs we rounded a point one day a Lynx appeared statuesque on a stranded\r\ncake of ice, a hundred yards off, and gazed at the approaching\r\nboats. True to their religion, the half-breeds seized their rifles,\r\nthe bullets whistled harmlessly about the \"Peeshoo\"--whereupon he\r\nturned and walked calmly up the slope, stopping to look at each\r\nfresh volley, but finally waved his stumpy tail and walked unharmed\r\nover the ridge. Distance fifty yards.\r\n\r\nOn May 28 we reached Fort MacMurray.\r\n\r\nHere I saw several interesting persons: Miss Christine Gordon, the\r\npostmaster; Joe Bird, a half-breed with all the advanced ideas of\r\na progressive white man; and an American ex-patriot, G------, a\r\ntall, raw-boned Yank from Illinois. He was a typical American of\r\nthe kind, that knows little of America and nothing of Europe; but\r\nshrewd and successful in spite of these limitations. In appearance\r\nhe was not unlike Abraham Lincoln. He was a rabid American, and\r\nwhy he stayed here was a question.\r\n\r\nHe had had no detailed tidings from home for years, and I never saw\r\na man more keen for the news. On the banks of the river we sat for\r\nan hour while he plied me with questions, which I answered so far\r\nas I could. He hung on my lips; he interrupted only when there seemed\r\na halt in the stream; he revelled in, all the details of wrecks\r\nby rail and sea. Roosevelt and the trusts--insurance scandals--the\r\nSouth the burnings in the West--massacres--murders--horrors--risings--these\r\nwere his special gloats, and yet he kept me going with \"Yes--yes--and\r\nthen?\" or \"Yes, by golly--that's the way we're a-doing it. Go on.\"\r\n\r\nThen, after I had robbed New York of $100,000,000 a year, burnt 10\r\nlarge towns and 45 small ones, wrecked 200 express trains, lynched\r\n96 negroes in the South and murdered many men every night for 7\r\nyears in Chicago--he broke out:\r\n\r\n\"By golly, we are a-doing it. We are the people. We are a-moving\r\nthings now; and I tell you I give the worst of them there European\r\ncountries, the very worst of 'em, just 100 years to become\r\nAmericanised.\"\r\n\r\nThink of that, ye polished Frenchmen; ye refined, courteous Swedes;\r\nye civilised Danes; you have 100 years to become truly Americanised!\r\n\r\nAll down the river route we came on relics of another class of\r\nwanderers--the Klondikers of 1898. Sometimes these were empty winter\r\ncabins; sometimes curious tools left at Hudson's Bay Posts, and in\r\nsome cases expensive provisions; in all cases we heard weird tales\r\nof their madness.\r\n\r\nThere is, I am told, a shanty on the Mackenzie above Simpson, where\r\nfour of them made a strange record. Cooped up for months in tight\r\nwinter quarters, they soon quarrelled, and at length their partnership\r\nwas dissolved. Each took the articles he had contributed, and those\r\nof common purchase they divided in four equal parts. The stove, the\r\ncanoe, the lamp, the spade, were broken relentlessly and savagely\r\ninto four parts--four piles of useless rubbish. The shanty was\r\ndivided in four. One man had some candles of his own bringing.\r\nThese he kept and carefully screened off his corner of the room so\r\nno chance rays might reach the others to comfort them; they spent\r\nthe winter in darkness. None spoke to the other, and they parted,\r\nsingly and silently, hatefully as ever, as soon as the springtime\r\nopened the way.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nDOWN THE SILENT RIVER WITH THE MOUNTED POLICE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAt Fort MacMurray we learned that there was no telling when the\r\nsteamer might arrive; Major Jarvis was under orders to proceed\r\nwithout delay to Smith Landing; so to solve all our difficulties\r\nI bought a 30-foot boat (sturgeon-head) of Joe Bird, and arranged\r\nto join forces with the police for the next part of the journey.\r\n\r\nI had made several unsuccessful attempts to get an experienced native\r\nboatman to go northward with me. All seemed to fear the intending\r\nplunge into the unknown; so was agreeably surprised when a sturdy\r\nyoung fellow of Scottish and Cree parentage came and volunteered\r\nfor the trip. A few inquiries proved him to bear a good reputation\r\nas a river-man and worker, so William C. Loutit was added to my\r\nexpedition and served me faithfully throughout.\r\n\r\nIn time I learned that Billy was a famous traveller. Some years\r\nago, when the flood had severed all communication between Athabaska\r\nLanding and Edmonton, Billy volunteered to carry some important\r\ndespatches, and covered the 96 miles on foot in one and a half days,\r\nalthough much of the road was under water. On another occasion he\r\nwent alone and afoot from House River up the Athabaska to Calling\r\nRiver, and across the Point to the Athabaska again, then up to the\r\nLanding-150 rough miles in four days. These exploits I had to find\r\nout for myself later on, but much more important to me at the time\r\nwas the fact that he was a first-class cook, a steady, cheerful\r\nworker, and a capable guide as far as Great Slave Lake.\r\n\r\nThe Athabaska below Fort MacMurray is a noble stream, one-third\r\nof a mile wide, deep, steady, unmarred; the banks are covered with\r\nunbroken virginal forests of tall white poplar, balsam poplar,\r\nspruce, and birch. The fire has done no damage here as yet, the\r\naxe has left no trace, there are no houses, no sign of man except\r\noccasional teepee poles. I could fancy myself floating down the\r\nOhio two hundred years ago.\r\n\r\nThese were bright days to be remembered, as we drifted down\r\nits placid tide in our ample and comfortable boat, with abundance\r\nof good things. Calm, lovely, spring weather; ducks all along the\r\nriver; plenty of food, which is the northerner's idea of bliss;\r\nplenty of water, which is the river-man's notion of joy; plenty\r\nof leisure, which is an element in most men's heaven, for we had\r\nmerely to float with the stream, three miles an hour, except when\r\nwe landed to eat or sleep.\r\n\r\nThe woods were donning their vernal green and resounded with the\r\ncalls of birds now. The mosquito plague of the region had not yet\r\nappeared, and there was little lacking to crown with a halo the\r\nmemory of those days on the Missouri of the North.\r\n\r\nNative quadrupeds seemed scarce, and we were all agog when one of\r\nthe men saw a black fox trotting along the opposite bank. However,\r\nit turned out to be one of the many stray dogs of the country. He\r\nfollowed us a mile or more, stopping at times to leap at fish that\r\nshowed near the shore. When we landed for lunch he swam the broad\r\nstream and hung about at a distance. As this was twenty miles from\r\nany settlement, he was doubtless hungry, so I left a bountiful\r\nlunch for him, and when we moved away, he claimed his own.\r\n\r\nAt Fort McKay I saw a little half-breed boy shooting with a bow\r\nand displaying extraordinary marksmanship. At sixty feet he could\r\nhit the bottom of a tomato tin nearly every time; and even more\r\nsurprising was the fact that he held the arrow with what is known\r\nas the Mediterranean hold. When, months later, I again stopped at\r\nthis place, I saw another boy doing the very same. Some residents\r\nassured me that this was the style of all the Chipewyans as well\r\nas the Crees.\r\n\r\nThat night we camped far down the river and on the side opposite\r\nthe Fort, for experience soon teaches one to give the dogs no\r\nchance of entering camp on marauding expeditions while you rest.\r\nAbout ten, as I was going to sleep, Preble put his head in and\r\nsaid: \"Come out here if you want a new sensation.\"\r\n\r\nIn a moment I was standing with him under the tall spruce trees,\r\nlooking over the river to the dark forest, a quarter mile away,\r\nand listening intently to a new and wonderful sound. Like the\r\nslow tolling of a soft but high-pitched bell, it came. Ting, ting,\r\nting, ting, and on, rising and falling with the breeze, but still\r\nkeeping on about two \"tings\" to the second; and on, dulling as\r\nwith distance, but rising again and again.\r\n\r\nIt was unlike anything I had ever heard, but Preble knew it of old.\r\n\"That\", says he, \"is the love-song of the Richardson Owl. She is\r\nsitting demurely in some spruce top while he sails around, singing\r\non the wing, and when the sound seems distant, he is on the far\r\nside of the tree.\"\r\n\r\nTing, ting, ting, ting, it went on and on, this soft belling\r\nof his love, this amorous music of our northern bell-bird. .\r\n\r\nTing, TING, ting, ting, ting, TING, ting, ting, ting, ting, TING,\r\nting--oh, how could any lady owl resist such strains?--and on, with\r\nits ting, ting, ting, TING, ting, ting, ting, TING, the whole night\r\nair was vibrant. Then, as though by plan, a different note--the\r\ndeep booming \"Oho-oh-who-oh who hoo\" of the Great Homed Owl--was\r\nheard singing a most appropriate bass.\r\n\r\nBut the little Owl went on and on; 5 minutes, 10 minutes, 20 minutes\r\nat last had elapsed before I turned in again and left him. More\r\nthan once that night I awoke to hear his \"tinging\" serenade upon\r\nthe consecrated air of the piney woods.\r\n\r\nYet Preble said this one was an indifferent performer. On the\r\nMackenzie he had heard far better singers of the kind; some that\r\nintroduce many variations of the pitch and modulation. I thought\r\nit one of the most charming bird voices I had ever listened to--and\r\nfelt that this was one of the things that make the journey worth\r\nwhile.\r\n\r\nOn June 1 the weather was so blustering and wet that we did not\r\nbreak camp. I put in the day examining the superb timber of this\r\nbottom-land. White spruce is the prevailing conifer and is here\r\nseen in perfection. A representative specimen was 118 feet high, 11\r\nfeet 2 inches in circumference, or 3 feet 6 1/2 inches in diameter\r\n1 foot from the ground, i.e., above any root spread. There was\r\nplenty of timber of similar height. Black spruce, a smaller kind,\r\nand tamarack are found farther up and back in the bog country.\r\njackpine of fair size abounds on the sandy and gravelly parts.\r\nBalsam poplar is the largest deciduous tree; its superb legions\r\nin upright ranks are crowded along all the river banks and on the\r\nislands not occupied by the spruce. The large trees of this kind\r\noften have deep holes; these are the nesting sites of the Whistler\r\nDuck, which is found in numbers here and as far north as this tree,\r\nbut not farther. White poplar is plentiful also; the hillsides are\r\nbeautifully clad with its purplish masses of twigs, through which\r\nits white stem gleam like marble columns. White birch is common\r\nand large enough for canoes. Two or three species of willow in\r\nimpenetrable thickets make up the rest of the forest stretches.\r\n\r\nAt this camp I had the unique experience of showing all these seasoned\r\nWesterners that it was possible to make a fire by the friction of\r\ntwo sticks. This has long been a specialty of mine; I use a thong\r\nand a bow as the simplest way. Ordinarily I prefer balsam-fir or\r\ntamarack; in this case I used a balsam block and a spruce drill,\r\nand, although each kind failed when used with drill and block the\r\nsame, I got the fire in half a minute.\r\n\r\nOn June 3 we left this camp of tall timber. As we floated down we\r\nsighted a Lynx on the bank looking contemplatively into the flood. One\r\nof the police boys seized a gun and with a charge of No. 6 killed\r\nthe Lynx. Poor thing, it was in a starving condition, as indeed\r\nare most meat-eaters this year in the north. Though it was fully\r\ngrown, it weighed but 15 pounds.\r\n\r\nIn its stomach was part of a sparrow (white-throat?) and a piece\r\nof rawhide an inch wide and 4 feet long, evidently a portion of a\r\ndog-harness picked up somewhere along the river. I wonder what he\r\ndid with the bells.\r\n\r\nThat night we decided to drift, leaving one man on guard. Next day,\r\nas we neared Lake Athabaska, the shores got lower, and the spruce\r\ndisappeared, giving way to dense thickets of low willow. Here\r\nthe long expected steamer, Graham, passed, going upstream. We now\r\nbegan to get occasional glimpses of Lake Athabaska across uncertain\r\nmarshes and sand bars. It was very necessary to make Fort Chipewyan\r\nwhile there was a calm, so we pushed on. After four hours' groping\r\namong blind channels and mud banks, we reached the lake at\r\nmidnight--though of course there was no night, but a sort of gloaming\r\neven at the darkest--and it took us four hours' hard rowing to\r\ncover the ten miles that separated us from Chipewyan.\r\n\r\nIt sounds very easy and commonplace when one says \"hard rowing,\"\r\nbut it takes on more significance when one is reminded that those\r\noars were 18 feet long, 5 inches through, and weighed about 20 pounds\r\neach; the boat was 30 feet long, a demasted schooner indeed, and\r\nrowing her through shallow muddy water, where the ground suction\r\nwas excessive, made labour so heavy that 15 minute spells were all\r\nany one could do. We formed four relays, and all worked in turn\r\nall night through, arriving at Chipewyan. 4 A.M., blistered, sore,\r\nand completely tired out.\r\n\r\nFort Chipewyan (pronounced Chip-we-yan') was Billy Loutit's home,\r\nand here we met his father, mother, and numerous as well as interesting\r\nsisters. Meanwhile I called at the Roman Catholic Mission, under\r\nBishop Gruard, and the rival establishment, under Reverend Roberts,\r\ngood men all, and devoted to the cause, but loving not each other.\r\nThe Hudson's Bay Company, however, was here, as everywhere in the\r\nnorth, the really important thing.\r\n\r\nThere was a long stretch of dead water before we could resume our\r\ndownward drift, and, worse than that, there was such a flood on the\r\nPeace River that it was backing the Athabaska, that is, the tide\r\nof the latter was reversed on the Rocher River, which extends\r\ntwenty-five miles between here and Peace mouth. To meet this, I\r\nhired Colin Fraser's steamer. We left Chipewyan at 6.15; at 11.15\r\ncamped below the Peace on Great Slave River, and bade farewell to\r\nthe steamer.\r\n\r\nThe reader may well be puzzled by these numerous names; the fact\r\nis the Mackenzie, the Slave, the Peace, the Rocher, and the Unchaga\r\nare all one and the same river, but, unfortunately, the early\r\nexplorers thought proper to give it a new name each time it did\r\nsomething, such as expand into a lake. By rights it should be the\r\nUnchaga or Unjiza, from the Rockies to the Arctic, with the Athabaska\r\nas its principal southern tributary.\r\n\r\nThe next day another Lynx was collected. In its stomach were\r\nremains of a Redsquirrel, a Chipmunk, and a Bog-lemming. The last\r\nwas important as it made a new record.\r\n\r\nThe Athabaska is a great river, the Peace is a greater, and the\r\nSlave, formed by their union, is worthy of its parents. Its placid\r\nflood is here nearly a mile wide, and its banks are covered with\r\na great continuous forest of spruce trees of the largest size. How\r\nfar back this extends I do not know, but the natives say the best\r\ntimber is along the river.\r\n\r\nMore than once a Lynx was seen trotting by or staring at us from\r\nthe bank, but no other large animal.\r\n\r\nOn the night of June 7 we reached Smith Landing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nA CONFERENCE WITH THE CHIEFS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA few bands of Buffalo are said to exist in the country east of\r\nGreat Slave River. Among other matters, Major Jarvis had to report\r\non these, find out how many were left, and exactly where they were.\r\nWhen he invited me to join his expedition, with these questions in\r\nview, I needed no pressing.\r\n\r\nOur first business was to get guides, and now our troubles began.\r\n\r\nThrough the traders we found four natives who knew the Buffalo\r\nrange--they were Kiya, Sousi, Kirma, and Peter Squirrel. However,\r\nthey seemed in no way desirous of guiding any one into that\r\ncountry. They dodged and delayed and secured many postponements,\r\nbut the Royal Mounted Police and the Hudson's Bay Company are the\r\ntwo mighty powers of the land, so, urged by an officer of each,\r\nthese worthies sullenly assembled to meet us in Sousi's cabin.\r\n\r\nSousi, by the way, is Chipewyan for Joseph, and this man's name\r\nwas Joseph Beaulieu. Other northern travellers have warned all that\r\ncame after them to beware of the tribe of Beaulieu, so we were on\r\nguard.\r\n\r\nSullen silence greeted us as we entered; we could feel their\r\ncovert antagonism. Jarvis is one of those affable, good-tempered\r\nindividuals that most persons take for \"easy.\" In some ways he may\r\nbe so, but I soon realised that he was a keen judge of men and their\r\nways, and he whispered to me: \"They mean to block us if possible.\"\r\nSousi understood French and had some English, but the others professed\r\nignorance of everything but Chipewyan. So it was necessary to call\r\nin an interpreter. How admirably he served us may be judged from\r\nthe following sample secured later.\r\n\r\nQ. Are the Buffalo near?\r\n\r\nA. Wah-hay-was-ki busquow Kai-ah taw nip-ee-wat-chow-es-kee\r\nnee-moy-ah. Kee-as-o-win sugee-meesh i-mush-wa mus-tat-e-muck\r\nne-mow-ah pe-muk-te-ok nemoy-ah dane-tay-tay-ah.\r\n\r\nInterpreter. He say \"no.\"\r\n\r\nQ. How long would it take to get them?\r\n\r\nA. Ne-moy-ah mis-chay-to-ok Way-hay-o ay-ow-ok-iman-kah-mus-to-ok.\r\nMis-ta-hay cha-gowos-ki wah-hay-o musk-ee-see-seepi. Mas-kootch\r\ne-goot-ah-i-ow mas-kootch ne-moy-ah muk-eboy sak-te-muk mas-kootch\r\ngahk-sin-now ne-moy-ah gehk-kee-win-tay dam-foole-Inglis.\r\n\r\nInterpreter. He say \"don't know.\"\r\n\r\nQ. Can you go with us as guide?\r\n\r\nA. Kee-ya-wah-lee nas-bah a-lash-tay wah-lee-lee lan-day. (Answer\r\nliterally) \"Yes, I could go if I could leave the transport.\"\r\n\r\nInterpreter's answer, \"Mebby.\"\r\n\r\nAfter a couple of hours of this bootless sort of thing we had\r\nmade no headway toward getting a guide, nor could we get definite\r\ninformation about the Buffaloes or the Wolves. Finally the meeting\r\nsuffered a sort of natural disintegration.\r\n\r\nNext day we tried again, but again there were technical difficulties,\r\ngrown up like mushrooms over night.\r\n\r\nKiya could not go or lend his horses, because it was mostly\r\nSquirrel's country, and he was afraid Squirrel would not like it.\r\nSquirrel could not go because it would be indelicate of him to\r\nbutt in after negotiations had been opened with Kiya. Kirma was not\r\nwell. Sousi could not go because his wife was sick, and it preyed\r\non his mind so that he dare not trust himself away from the\r\nsettlement; at least, not without much medicine to fortify him\r\nagainst rheumatism, home-sickness, and sadness.\r\n\r\nNext day Kiya sent word that he had business of great moment, and\r\ncould not meet us, but would see that early in the morning Squirrel\r\nwas notified to come and do whatever we wished. In the morning Squirrel\r\nalso had disappeared, leaving word that he had quite overlooked a\r\nmost important engagement to \"portage some flour across the rapids,\"\r\nnot that he loved the tump line, but he had \"promised,\" and to keep\r\nhis word was very precious to him.\r\n\r\nJarvis and I talked it over and reviewed the information we had.\r\nAt Ottawa it was reported that the Wolves were killing the calves,\r\nso the Buffalo did not increase. At Winnipeg the Wolves were so\r\nbad that they killed yearlings; at Edmonton the cows were not safe.\r\n\r\nAt Chipewyan the Wolves, reinforced by large bands from the Barren\r\nGrounds, were killing the young Buffalo, and later the cows and\r\nyoung bulls. At Smith's Landing the Wolves had even tackled an old\r\nbull whose head was found with the large bones. Horses and dogs\r\nwere now being devoured. Terrible battles were taking place between\r\nthe dark Wolves of Peace River and the White Wolves of the Barrens\r\nfor possession of the Buffalo grounds. Of course the Buffalo were\r\ndisappearing; about a hundred were all that were left.\r\n\r\nBut no one ever sees any of these terrible Wolves, the few men who\r\nknow that country have plenty of pemmican, that is neither Moose\r\nnor Caribou, and the Major briefly summed up the situation: \"The\r\nWolves are indeed playing havoc with the Buffalo, and the ravenous\r\nleaders of the pack are called Sousi, Kiya, Kirma, and Squirrel.\"\r\n\r\nNow of all the four, Sousi, being a Beaulieu and a half-breed, had\r\nthe worst reputation, but of all the four he was the only one that\r\nhad admitted a possibility of guiding us, and was to be found on the\r\nfifth morning. So his views were met, a substitute found to watch\r\nhis fishing nets, groceries to keep his wife from pining during his\r\nabsence, a present for himself, the regular rate of wages doubled,\r\nhis horses hired, his rheumatism, home-sickness, and sadness provided\r\nagainst, a present of tobacco, some more presents, a promise of\r\nreward for every Buffalo shown, then another present, and we set\r\nout.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nOUT WITH SOUSI BEAULIEU\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt's a, fine thing to get started, however late in the day, and\r\nthough it was 3.20 P. M. before everything was ready, we gladly\r\nset out--Sousi, Major Jarvis, and myself--all mounted, the native\r\nleading a packhorse with provisions.\r\n\r\nAnd now we had a chance to study our guide. A man's real history\r\nbegins, of course, about twenty years before he is born. In\r\nthe middle of the last century was a notorious old ruffian named\r\nBeaulieu. Montreal was too slow for him, so he invaded the north-west\r\nwith a chosen crew of congenial spirits. His history can be got from\r\nany old resident of the north-west. I should not like to write it\r\nas it was told to me.\r\n\r\nHis alleged offspring are everywhere in the country, and most\r\ntravellers on their return from this region, sound a note of warning:\r\n\"Look out for every one of the name of Beaulieu. They are a queer\r\nlot.\" And now we had committed ourselves and our fortunes into the\r\nhands of Beaulieu's second or twenty-second son--I could not make\r\nsure which. He is a typical half-breed, of medium height, thin,\r\nswarthy, and very active, although he must be far past 60. Just how\r\nfar is not known, whether 59 69 or 79, he himself seemed uncertain,\r\nbut he knows there is a 9 in it. The women of Smith's Landing say\r\n59, the men say 79 or 89.\r\n\r\nHe is clad in what might be the cast-off garments of a white tramp,\r\nexcept for his beaded moccasins. However sordid these people may be\r\nin other parts of their attire, I note that they always have some\r\nredeeming touch of color and beauty about the moccasins which\r\ncover their truly shapely feet. Sousi's rifle, a Winchester, also\r\nwas clad in a native mode. An embroidered cover of moose leather\r\nprotected it night and day, except when actually in use; of\r\nhis weapons he took most scrupulous care. Unlike the founder of\r\nthe family, Sousi has no children of his own. But he has reared a\r\ndozen waifs under prompting of his own kind heart. He is quite a\r\ncharacter--does not drink or smoke, and I never heard him swear.\r\nThis is not because he does not know how, for he is conversant with\r\nthe vigor of all the five languages of the country, and the garment\r\nof his thought is like Joseph's coat--Ethnologically speaking, its\r\nbreadth and substance are French, but it bears patches of English,\r\nwith flowers and frills, strophes, and classical allusions of Cree\r\nand Chipewyan--the last being the language of his present \"home\r\ncircle.\"\r\n\r\nThere was one more peculiarity of our guide that struck me forcibly.\r\nHe was forever considering his horse. Whenever the trail was very\r\nbad, and half of it was, Sousi dismounted and walked--the horse\r\nusually following freely, for the pair were close friends.\r\n\r\nThis, then, was the dark villain against whom we had been warned.\r\nHow he lived up to his reputation will be seen later.\r\n\r\nAfter four hours' march through a level, swampy country, forested\r\nwith black and white spruce, black and white poplar, birch, willow,\r\nand tamarack, we came to Salt River, a clear, beautiful stream,\r\nbut of weak, salty brine.\r\n\r\nNot far away in the woods was a sweet spring, and here we camped\r\nfor the night. Close by, on a place recently burnt over, I found\r\nthe nest of a Green-winged Teal. All cover was gone and the nest\r\nmuch singed, but the down had protected the 10 eggs. The old one\r\nfluttered off, played lame, and tried to lead me away. I covered\r\nup the eggs and an hour later found she had returned and resumed\r\nher post.\r\n\r\nThat night, as I sat by the fire musing, I went over my life when\r\nI was a boy in Manitoba, just too late to see the Buffalo, recalling\r\nhow I used to lie in some old Buffalo wallow and peer out over the\r\nprairie through the fringe of spring anemones and long to see the\r\nbig brown forms on the plains. Once in those days I got a sensation,\r\nfor I did see them. They turned out to be a herd of common cattle,\r\nbut still I got the thrill.\r\n\r\nNow I was on a real Buffalo hunt, some twenty-five years too late.\r\nWill it come? Am I really to see the Wild Buffalo on its native\r\nplains? It is too good to be true; too much like tipping back the\r\nsands of time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nTHE BUFFALO HUNT\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe left camp on Salt River at 7.45 in the morning and travelled\r\ntill 11 o'clock, covering six miles. It was all through the same\r\nlevel country, in which willow swamps alternated with poplar and\r\nspruce ridges. At 11 it began to rain, so we camped on a slope under\r\nsome fine, big white spruces till it cleared, and then continued\r\nwestward. The country now undulated somewhat and was varied with\r\nopenings.\r\n\r\nSousi says that when first he saw this region, 30 years ago, it\r\nwas all open prairie, with timber only in hollows and about water.\r\nThis is borne out by the facts that all the large trees are in such\r\nplaces, and that all the level open stretches are covered with\r\nsapling growths of aspen and fir. This will make a glorious settlement\r\nsome day. In plants, trees, birds, soil, climate, and apparently\r\nall conditions, it is like Manitoba.\r\n\r\nWe found the skeleton of a cow Buffalo, apparently devoured\r\nby Wolves years ago, because all the big bones were there and the\r\nskull unbroken.\r\n\r\nAbout two in the afternoon we came up a 200-foot rise to a beautiful\r\nupland country, in which the forests were diversified with open\r\nglades, and which everywhere showed a most singular feature. The\r\nground is pitted all over with funnel-shaped holes, from 6 to 40\r\nfeet deep, and of equal width across the rim; none of them contained\r\nwater. I saw one 100 feet across and about 50 feet deep; some expose\r\nlimestone; in one place we saw granite.\r\n\r\nAt first I took these for extinct geysers, but later I learned that\r\nthe whole plateau called Salt Mountain is pitted over with them.\r\nBrine is running out of the mountain in great quantities, which\r\nmeans that the upper strata are being undermined as the salt washes\r\nout, and, as these crack, the funnels are formed no doubt by the\r\nloose deposits settling.\r\n\r\nIn the dry woods Bear tracks became extremely numerous; the whole\r\ncountry, indeed, was marked with the various signs. Practically\r\nevery big tree has bearclaw markings on it, and every few yards\r\nthere is evidence that the diet of the bears just now is chiefly\r\nberries of Uva ursi.\r\n\r\nAs we rode along Sousi prattled cheerfully in his various tongues;\r\nbut his steady flow of conversation abruptly ended when, about 2\r\nP. M., we came suddenly on some Buffalo tracks, days old, but still\r\nBuffalo tracks. All at once and completely he was the hunter. He\r\nleaped from his horse and led away like a hound.\r\n\r\nEre long, of course, the trail was crossed by two fresher ones;\r\nthen we found some dry wallows and several very fresh tracks. We\r\ntied up the horses in an old funnel pit and set about an elaborate\r\nhunt. Jarvis minded the stock, I set out with Sousi, after he had\r\ntried the wind by tossing up some grass. But he stopped, drew a\r\nfinger-nail sharply across my canvas coat, so that it gave a little\r\nshriek, and said \"Va pa,\" which is \"Cela ne va pas\" reduced to its\r\nbony framework. I doffed the offending coat and we went forward as\r\nshown on the map. The horses were left at A; the wind was east. First\r\nwe circled a little to eastward, tossing grass at intervals, but,\r\nfinding plenty of new sign, went northerly and westward till most\r\nof the new sign was east of us. Sousi then led for C, telling me to\r\nstep in his tracks and make no noise. I did so for long, but at\r\nlength a stick cracked under my foot; he turned and looked reproachfully\r\nat me. Then a stick cracked under his foot; I gave him a poke in the\r\nribs. When we got to the land between the lake at D, Sousi pointed\r\nand said, \"They are here.\" We sneaked with the utmost caution that\r\nway--it was impossible to follow any one trail--and in 200 yards Sousi\r\nsank to the ground gasping out, \"La! la! maintenon faites son portrait\r\nau taut que vous voudrez.\" I crawled forward and saw, not one, but\r\nhalf a dozen Buffalo. \"I must be nearer,\" I said, and, lying flat\r\non my breast, crawled, toes and elbows, up to a bush within 75\r\nyards, where I made shot No. 1, and saw here that there were 8 or\r\n9 Buffalo, one an immense bull.\r\n\r\nSousi now cocked his rifle-I said emphatically: \"Stop! you must not\r\nfire.\" \"No?\" he said in astonished tones that were full of story\r\nand comment. \"What did we come for?\" Now I saw that by backing\r\nout and crawling to another bunch of herbage I could get within 50\r\nyards.\r\n\r\n\"It is not possible,\" he gasped.\r\n\r\n\"Watch me and see,\" I replied. Gathering all the near vines\r\nand twisting them around my neck, I covered my head with leaves\r\nand creeping plants, then proceeded to show that it was possible,\r\nwhile Sousi followed. I reached the cover and found it was a bed\r\nof spring anemones on the far side of an old Buffalo wallow, and\r\nthere in that wallow I lay for a moment revelling in the sight. All\r\nat once it came to me: Now, indeed, was fulfilled the long-deferred\r\ndream of my youth, for in shelter of those flowers of my youth, I\r\nwas gazing on a herd of wild Buffalo. Then slowly I rose above the\r\ncover and took my second picture.\r\n\r\nBut the watchful creatures, more shy than Moose here, saw the\r\nrising mass of herbage, or may have caught the wind, rose lightly\r\nand went off. I noticed now, for the first time, a little red calf;\r\nten Buffalo in all I counted. Sousi, standing up, counted 13. At\r\nthe edge of the woods they stopped and looked around, but gave no\r\nthird shot for the camera.\r\n\r\nI shook Sousi's hand with all my heart, and he, good old fellow,\r\nsaid: \"Ah! it was for this I prayed last night; without doubt it\r\nwas in answer to my prayer that the Good God has sent me this great\r\nhappiness.\"\r\n\r\nThen back at camp, 200 yards away, the old man's tongue was loosed,\r\nand he told me how the chiefs in conference, and every one at the\r\nFort, had ridiculed him and his Englishmen--\"who thought they\r\ncould walk up to Buffalo and take their pictures.\"\r\n\r\nWe had not been long in camp when Sousi went off to get some water,\r\nbut at once came running back, shouting excitedly, \"My rifle,\r\nmy rifle!\" Jarvis handed it to him; he rushed off to the woods. I\r\nfollowed in time to see him shoot an old Bear and two cubs out of\r\na tree. She fell, sobbing like a human being, \"Oh! Oh! Oh-h-h-h!\"\r\nIt was too late to stop him, and he finished her as she lay helpless.\r\nThe little ones were too small to live alone, so shared her fate.\r\n\r\nIt seems, as Sousi went to the water hole, he came on an old Bear\r\nand her two cubs. She gave a warning \"koff, koff.\" The only enemies\r\nthey knew about and feared, were Buffalo, Moose, and Wolves; from\r\nthese a tree was a safe haven. The cubs scrambled up a tall poplar,\r\nthen the mother followed. Sousi came shouting in apparent fear;  I\r\nrushed to the place, thinking he was attacked by something, perhaps\r\na Buffalo bull, but too late to stop the tragedy that followed.\r\n\r\nThat night he roasted one of the cubs, and as I watched the old\r\ncannibal chewing the hands off that little baby Bear it gave me a\r\nfeeling of disgust for all flesh-eating that lasted for days. Major\r\nJarvis felt much as I did, and old Sousi had exclusive joy in all\r\nhis bear meat.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNext morning I was left at camp while Jarvis and Sousi went off to\r\nseek for more Buffalo. I had a presentiment that they would find\r\nnone, so kept the camera and went off to the Lake a mile west, and\r\nthere made drawings of some tracks, took photos, etc., and on the\r\nlake saw about twenty-five pairs of ducks, identified Whitewinged\r\nScoter, Pintail, Green-winged Teal, and Loon. I also watched the\r\nmanoeuvres of a courting Peetweet. He approached the only lady with\r\nhis feathers up and his wings raised; she paid no heed (apparently),\r\nbut I noticed that when he flew away she followed. I saw a large\r\ngarter snake striped black and green, and with 2 rows of red\r\nspots, one on each side. It was very fat and sluggish. I took it\r\nfor a female about to lay. Later I learned from Sousi and others\r\nthat this snake is quite common here, and the only kind found,\r\nbut in the mountains that lie not far away in the west is another\r\nkind, much thicker, fatter, and more sluggish. Its bite is fearfully\r\npoisonous, often fatal; \"but the Good God has marked the beast by\r\nputting a cloche (bell) in its tail.\"\r\n\r\nAbout 10 I turned campward, but after tramping for nearly an\r\nhour I was not only not at home, I was in a totally strange kind\r\nof country, covered with a continuous poplar woods. I changed my\r\ncourse and tried a different direction, but soon was forced to the\r\nconclusion that (for the sixth or seventh time in my life) I was\r\nlost.\r\n\r\n\"Dear me,\" I said, \"this is an interesting opportunity. It comes\r\nto me now that I once wrote an essay on 'What To Do and What Not\r\nTo Do When Lost In the Woods.' Now what in the world did I say in\r\nit, and which were the things not to do. Yes, I remember now, these\r\nwere the pieces of advice:\r\n\r\n\"1st. 'Don't get frightened.' Well, I'm not; I am simply amused.\r\n\r\n\"2d. 'Wait for your friends to come.' Can't do that; I'm too busy;\r\nthey wouldn't appear till night.\r\n\r\n\"3d. 'If you must travel, go back to a place where you were sure\r\nof the way.' That means back to the lake, which I know is due west\r\nof the camp and must be west of me now.\"\r\n\r\nSo back I went, carefully watching the sun for guidance, and soon\r\nrealised that whenever I did not, I swung to the left. After nearly\r\nan hour's diligent travel I did get back to the lake, and followed\r\nmy own track in the margin to the point of leaving it; then, with\r\na careful corrected bearing, made for camp and arrived in 40 minutes,\r\nthere to learn that on the first attempt I had swung so far to the\r\nleft that I had missed camp by half a mile, and was half a mile\r\nbeyond it before I knew I was wrong. (See map on p. 46.)\r\n\r\nAt noon Jarvis and Sousi came back jubilant; they had seen countless\r\nBuffalo trails, had followed a large bull and cow, but had left\r\nthem to take the trail of a considerable Band; these they discovered\r\nin a lake. There were 4 big bulls, 4 little calves, 1 yearling, 3\r\n2-year-olds, 8 cows. These allowed them to come openly within 60\r\nyards. Then took alarm and galloped off. They also saw a Moose and\r\na Marten--and 2 Buffalo skeletons. How I did curse my presentiment\r\nthat prevented them having the camera and securing a really fine\r\nphotograph!\r\n\r\nAt 2 P. M. Sousi prepared to break camp. He thought that by going\r\nback on our trail he might strike the trail of another herd off\r\nto the south-east of the mountain. Jarvis shrewdly suspected that\r\nour guide wanted to go home, having kept his promise, won the\r\nreward, and got a load of Bear meat. However, the native was the\r\nguide, we set out in a shower which continued more or less all day\r\nand into the night, so we camped in the rain.\r\n\r\nNext day it was obvious, and Sousi no longer concealed the fact,\r\nthat he was making for home as fast as he could go.\r\n\r\nAt Salt River I found the little Teal back on her eggs in the\r\nburnt ground. At 3.30 we reached Smith Landing, having been absent\r\nexactly 3 days, and having seen in that time 33 Buffalo, 4 of them\r\ncalves of this year, 3 old Buffalo skeletons of ancient date, but\r\nnot a track or sign of a Wolf, not a howl by night, or any evidence\r\nof their recent presence, for the buffalo skeletons found were\r\nobviously very old.\r\n\r\nAnd our guide--the wicked one of evil ancestry and fame--he was\r\nkind, cheerful, and courteous through out; he did exactly as he\r\npromised, did it on time, and was well pleased with the pay we gave\r\nhim. Speak as you find. If ever I revisit that country I shall be\r\nglad indeed to secure the services of good old Sousi, even if he\r\nis a Beaulieu.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nTHOMAS ANDERSON\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe were now back at Smith Landing, and fired with a desire to make\r\nanother Buffalo expedition on which we should have ampler time and\r\ncover more than a mere corner of the range. We aimed, indeed, to\r\nstrike straight into the heart of the Buffalo country. The same\r\ntrouble about guides arose. In this case it was less acute, because\r\nSousi's account had inspired considerably more respect. Still it\r\nmeant days of delay which, however, I aimed to make profitable by\r\ninvestigations near at hand.\r\n\r\nAfter all, the most interesting of creatures is the two-legged one\r\nwith the loose and changeable skin, and there was a goodly colony\r\nof the kind to choose from. Most prominent of them all was Thomas\r\nAnderson, the genial Hudson's Bay Company officer in charge of\r\nthe Mackenzie River District. His headquarters are at Fort Smith,\r\n16 miles down the river, but his present abode was Smith Landing,\r\nwhere all goods are landed for overland transport to avoid the long\r\nand dangerous navigation on the next 16 miles of the broad stream.\r\nLike most of his official brethren, he is a Scotchman; he was born\r\nin Nairn, Scotland, in 1848. At 19 he came to the north-west in\r\nservice of the company, and his long and adventurous life, as he\r\nclimbed to his present responsible position, may be thus skeletonised:\r\n\r\n\r\nHe spent six months at Fort Temiscamingue,\r\n1 year at Grand Lac,\r\n3 years at Kakabonga,\r\n5 years at Hunter's Lodge, Chippeway,\r\n10 years at Abitibi,\r\n3 years at Dunvegan, Peace River,\r\n1 year at Lesser Slave Lake,\r\n2 months at Savanne, Fort William,\r\n10 years at Nipigon House,\r\n3 years at Isle a la Crosse,\r\n4 years on the Mackenzie River, chiefly at Fort Simpson,\r\n6 months at Fort Smith.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhich tells little to the ears of the big world, but if we say that\r\nhe spent 5 years in Berlin, then was moved for 3 years to Gibraltar,\r\n2 years to various posts on the Rhine, whence he went for 4 years\r\nto St. Petersburg; thence to relieve the officer in charge of\r\nConstantinople, and made several flying visits to Bombay and Pekin,\r\nwe shall have some idea of his travels, for all were afoot, on\r\ndogsled, or by canoe.\r\n\r\nWhat wonderful opportunities he had to learn new facts about the\r\nwood folk--man and beast--and how little he knew the value of the\r\nglimpses that he got! I made it my business to gather all I could\r\nof his memories, so far as they dwelt with the things of my world,\r\nand offer now a resume of his more interesting observations on\r\nhunter and hunted of the North. [Since these notes were made, Thomas\r\nAnderson has \"crossed the long portage.\"]\r\n\r\nThe following are among the interesting animal notes:\r\n\r\nCougar. Ogushen, the Indian trapper at Lac des Quinze, found tracks\r\nof a large cat at that place in the fall of 1879 (?). He saw them\r\nall winter on South Bay of that Lake. One day he came on the place\r\nwhere it had killed a Caribou. When he came back about March he saw\r\nit. It came toward him. It was evidently a cat longer than a Lynx\r\nand it had a very long tail, which swayed from side to side as\r\nit walked. He shot it dead, but feared to go near it believing it\r\nto be a Wendigo. It had a very bad smell. Anderson took it to be\r\na Puma. It was unknown to the Indian. Ogushen was a first-class\r\nhunter and Anderson firmly believes he was telling the truth. Lac\r\ndes Quinze is 15 miles north of Lake Temiscamingue.\r\n\r\nSeals. In old days, he says, small seals were found in Lake Ashkeek.\r\nThis is 50 miles north-east from Temiscamingue. It empties into\r\nKippewa River, which empties into Temiscamingue. He never saw one,\r\nbut the Indians of the vicinity told of it as a thing which commonly\r\nhappened 50 or 60 years ago. Ashkeek is Ojibwa for seal. It is\r\nsupposed that they wintered in the open water about the Rapids.\r\n\r\nWhite Foxes, he says, were often taken at Cree Lake. Indeed one or\r\ntwo were captured each year. Cree Lake is 190 miles south-east of\r\nFort Chipewyan. They are also taken at Fort Chipewyan from time to\r\ntime. One was taken at Fondulac, east end of Lake Athabaska, and\r\nwas traded at Smith Landing in 1906. They are found regularly at\r\nFondulac, the east end of Great Slave Lake, each year.\r\n\r\nIn the winter of 1885-6 he was to be in charge of Nipigon House,\r\nbut got orders beforehand to visit the posts on Albany River. He\r\nset out from Fort William on Lake Superior on his 1,200-mile trip\r\nthrough the snow with an Indian whose name was Joe Eskimo, from\r\nManitoulin Island, 400 miles away. At Nipigon House he got another\r\nguide, but this one was in bad shape, spitting blood. After three\r\ndays' travel the guide said: \"I will go to the end if it kills me,\r\nbecause I have promised, unless I can get you a better guide. At\r\nWayabimika (Lake Savanne) is an old man named Omeegi; he knows the\r\nroad better than I do.\" When they got there, Omeegi, although very\r\nold and half-blind, was willing to go on condition that they should\r\nnot walk too fast. Then they started for Osnaburgh House on Lake\r\nSt. Joseph, 150 miles away. The old man led off well, evidently knew\r\nthe way, but sometimes would stop, cover his eyes with his hands,\r\nlook at the ground and then at the sky, and turn on a sharp angle.\r\nHe proved a fine guide and brought the expedition there in good\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nNext winter at Wayabimika (where Charley de la Ronde [Count de la\r\nRonde.] was in charge, but was leaving on a trip of 10 days) Omeegi\r\ncame in and asked for a present--\"a new shirt and a pair of pants.\"\r\nThis is the usual outfit for a corpse. He explained that he was to\r\ndie before Charley came back; that he would die \"when the sun rose\r\nat that island\" (a week ahead). He got the clothes, though every\r\none laughed at him. A week later he put on the new garments and\r\nsaid: \"To-day I die when the sun is over that island!\" He went\r\nout, looking at the sun from time to time, placidly smoking. When\r\nthe sun got to the right place he came in, lay down by the fire,\r\nand in a few minutes was dead.\r\n\r\nWe buried him in the ground, to his brother's great indignation\r\nwhen he heard of it. He said: \"You white men live on things that\r\ncome out of the ground, and are buried in the ground, and properly,\r\nbut we Indians live on things that run above ground, and want to\r\ntake our last sleep in the trees.\"\r\n\r\nAnother case of Indian clairvoyance ran thus: About 1879, when\r\nAnderson was at Abitibi, the winter packet used to leave Montreal,\r\nJanuary 2, each year, and arrive at Abitibi January 19. This year\r\nit did not come.  The men were much bothered as all plans were upset.\r\nAfter waiting about two weeks, some of the Indians and half-breeds\r\nadvised Anderson to consult the conjuring woman, Mash-kou-tay\r\nIsh-quay (Prairie woman) a Flathead from Stuart Lake, B. C. He\r\nwent and paid her some tobacco. She drummed and conjured all night.\r\nShe came in the morning and told him: \"The packet is at the foot\r\nof a rapid now, where there is open water; the snow is deep and\r\nthe travelling heavy, but it will be here to-morrow when the sun\r\nis at that point.\"\r\n\r\nSure enough, it all fell out as she had told. This woman married\r\na Hudson's Bay man named MacDonald, and he brought her to Lachine,\r\nwhere she bore him 3 sons; then he died of small-pox, and Sir\r\nGeorge Simpson gave orders that she should be sent up to Abitibi\r\nand there pensioned for as long as she lived. She was about 75 at\r\nthe time of the incident. She many times gave evidence of clairvoyant\r\npower. The priest said he \"knew about it, and that she was helped\r\nby the devil.\"\r\n\r\nA gruesome picture of Indian life is given in the following incident.\r\n\r\nOne winter, 40 or 50 years ago, a band of Algonquin Indians at\r\nWayabimika all starved to death except one squaw and her baby; she\r\nfled from the camp, carrying the child, thinking to find friends\r\nand help at Nipigon House. She got as far as a small lake near\r\nDeer Lake, and there discovered a cache, probably in a tree. This\r\ncontained one small bone fish-hook. She rigged up a line, but had\r\nno bait. The wailing of the baby spurred her to action. No bait,\r\nbut she had a knife; a strip of flesh was quickly cut from her\r\nown leg, a hole made through the ice, and a fine jack-fish was the\r\nfood that was sent to this devoted mother. She divided it with the\r\nchild, saving only enough for bait. She stayed there living on fish\r\nuntil spring, then safely rejoined her people.\r\n\r\nThe boy grew up to be a strong man, but was cruel to his mother,\r\nleaving her finally to die of starvation. Anderson knew the woman;\r\nshe showed him the sear where she cut the bait.\r\n\r\nA piece of yet, more ancient history was supplied him in Northern\r\nOntario, and related to me thus:\r\n\r\nAnderson was going to Kakabonga in June, 1879, and camped one\r\nnight on the east side of Birch Lake on the Ottawa, about 50 miles\r\nnorth-east of Grand Lake Post.\r\n\r\nHe and his outfit of two canoes met Pah-pah-tay, chief of the Grand\r\nLake Indians, travelling with his family. He called Anderson's\r\nattention to the shape of the point which had one good landing-place,\r\na little sandy bay, and told him the story he heard from his people\r\nof a battle that was fought there with the Iroquois long, long ago.\r\n\r\nFour or five Iroquois war-canoes, filled with warriors, came to\r\nthis place on a foray for scalps. Their canoes were drawn up on\r\nthe beach at night. They lighted fires and had a war-dance. Three\r\nGrand Lake Algonquins, forefathers of Pah-pah-tay, saw the dance\r\nfrom, hiding. They cached their canoe, one of them took a sharp\r\nflint--\"we had no knives or axes then\"--swam across to the canoes,\r\nand cut a great hole in the bottom of each.\r\n\r\nThe three then posted themselves at three different points in the\r\nbushes, and began whooping in as many different ways as possible.\r\nThe Iroquois, thinking it a great war-party, rushed to their canoes\r\nand pushed off quickly. When they were in deep water the canoes\r\nsank and, as the warriors swam back ashore, the Algonquins killed\r\nthem one by one, saving alive only one, whom they maltreated, and\r\nthen let go with a supply of food, as a messenger to his people, and\r\nto carry the warning that this would be the fate of every Iroquois\r\nthat entered the Algonquin country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nMOSQUITOES\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nReference to my Smith Landing Journal for June 17 shows the following:\r\n\r\n\"The Spring is now on in full flood, the grass is high, the trees\r\nare fully leaved, flowers are blooming, birds are nesting, and the\r\nmosquitoes are a terror to man and beast.\"\r\n\r\nIf I were to repeat all the entries in that last key, it would make\r\ndreary and painful reading; I shall rather say the worst right now,\r\nand henceforth avoid the subject.\r\n\r\nEvery traveller in the country agrees that the mosquitoes are\r\na frightful curse. Captain Back, in 1833 (Journal, p. 117), said\r\nthat the sand-flies and mosquitoes are the worst of the hardships\r\nto which the northern traveller is exposed.\r\n\r\nT. Hutchins, over a hundred years ago, said that no one enters the\r\nBarren Grounds in the summer, because no man can stand the stinging\r\ninsects. I had read these various statements, but did not grasp the\r\nidea until I was among them. At Smith Landing, June 7, mosquitoes\r\nbegan to be troublesome, quite as numerous as in the worst part of\r\nthe New Jersey marshes. An estimate of those on the mosquito bar\r\nover my bed, showed 900 to 1,000 trying to get at me; day and night,\r\nwithout change, the air was ringing with their hum.\r\n\r\nThis was early in the season. On July 9, on Nyarling River, they\r\nwere much worse, and my entry was as follows:\r\n\r\n\"'On the back of Billy's coat, as he sat paddling before me, I\r\ncounted a round 400 mosquitoes boring away; about as many were on\r\nthe garments of his head and neck, a much less number on his arms\r\nand legs. The air about was thick with them; at least as many\r\nmore, fully 1,000, singing and stinging and filling the air with\r\na droning hum. The rest of us were equally pestered.\r\n\r\n\"'The Major, fresh, ruddy, full-blooded, far over 200 pounds in\r\nplumpness, is the best feeding ground for mosquitoes I (or they,\r\nprobably) ever saw; he must be a great improvement on the smoke-dried\r\nIndians. No matter where they land on him they strike it rich,\r\nand at all times a dozen or more bloated bloodsuckers may be seen\r\nhanging like red currants on his face and neck. He maintains that\r\nthey do not bother him, and scoffs at me for wearing a net. They\r\ncertainly do not impair his health, good looks, or his perennial good\r\nhumour, and I, for one, am thankful that his superior food-quality\r\ngives us a corresponding measure of immunity.\"\r\n\r\nAt Salt River one could kill 100 with a stroke of the palm and\r\nat times they obscured the colour of the horses. A little later\r\nthey were much worse. On 6 square inches of my tent I counted 30\r\nmosquitoes, and the whole surface was similarly supplied; that is,\r\nthere were 24,000 on the tent and apparently as many more flying\r\nabout the door. Most of those that bite us are killed but that\r\nmakes not the slightest perceptible difference in their manners\r\nor numbers. They reminded me of the Klondike gold-seekers. Thousands\r\ngo; great numbers must die a miserable death; not more than one in\r\n10,000 can get away with a load of the coveted stuff, and yet each\r\nbelieves that he is to be that one, and pushes on.\r\n\r\nDr. L. 0. Howard tells us that the mosquito rarely goes far from\r\nits birthplace. That must refer to the miserable degenerates they\r\nhave in New Jersey, for these of the north offer endless evidence\r\nof power to travel, as well as to resist cold and wind.\r\n\r\nOn July 21, 1907, we camped on a small island on Great Slave Lake.\r\nIt was about one-quarter mile long, several miles from mainland,\r\nat least half a mile from any other island, apparently all rock,\r\nand yet it was swarming with mosquitoes. Here, as elsewhere, they\r\nwere mad for our blood; those we knocked off and maimed, would\r\ncrawl up with sprained wings and twisted legs to sting as fiercely\r\nas ever, as long as the beak would work.\r\n\r\nWe thought the stinging pests of the Buffalo country as bad as\r\npossible, but they proved mild and scarce compared with those we\r\nyet had to meet on the Arctic Barrens of our ultimate goal.\r\n\r\nEach day they got worse; soon it became clear that mere adjectives\r\ncould not convey any idea of their terrors. Therefore I devised a\r\nmosquito gauge. I held up a bare hand for 5 seconds by the watch,\r\nthen counted the number of borers on the back; there were 5 to 10.\r\nEach day added to the number, and when we got out to the Buffalo\r\ncountry, there were 15 to 25 on the one side of the hand and\r\nelsewhere in proportion. On the Nyarling, in early July, the number\r\nwas increased, being now 20 to 40. On Great Slave Lake, later that\r\nmonth, there were 50 to 60. But when we reached the Barren Grounds,\r\nthe land of open breezy plains and cold water lakes, the pests\r\nwere so bad that the hand held up for 5 seconds often showed from\r\n100 to 125 long-billed mosquitoes boring away into the flesh. It\r\nwas possible to number them only by killing them and counting the\r\ncorpses. What wonder that all men should avoid the open plains,\r\nthat are the kingdom of such a scourge.\r\n\r\nYet it must not be thought that the whole country is similarly and\r\nevenly filled. There can be no doubt that they flock and fly to\r\nthe big moving creatures they see or smell. Maybe we had gathered\r\nthe whole mosquito product of many acres. This is shown by the\r\nfacts that if one rushes through thick bushes for a distance, into\r\na clear space, the mosquitoes seem absent at first. One must wait\r\na minute or so to gather up another legion. When landing from a\r\nboat on the Northern Lakes there are comparatively few, but even\r\nin a high wind, a walk to the nearest hilltop results in one again\r\nmoving in a cloud of tormentors. Does not this readiness to assemble\r\nat a bait suggest a possible means of destroying them?\r\n\r\nEvery one, even the seasoned natives, agree that they are a terror\r\nto man and beast; but, thanks to our flyproof tents, we sleep immune.\r\nDuring the day I wear my net and gloves, uncomfortably hot, but a\r\nblessed relief from the torment. It is easy to get used to those\r\ncoverings; it is impossible to get used to the mosquitoes.\r\n\r\nFor July 10 I find this note: \"The Mosquitoes are worse now than\r\never before; even Jarvis, Preble, and the Indians are wearing face\r\nprotectors of some kind. The Major has borrowed Preble's closed net,\r\nmuch to the latter's discomfiture, as he himself would be glad to\r\nwear it.\"\r\n\r\nThis country has, for 6 months, the finest climate in the world,\r\nbut 2 1/2 of these are ruined by the malignancy of the fly plague.\r\nYet it is certain that knowledge will confer on man the power to\r\nwipe them out.\r\n\r\nNo doubt the first step in this direction is a thorough understanding\r\nof the creature's life-history. This understanding many able mien\r\nare working for. But there is another line of thought that should\r\nnot be forgotten, though it is negative--many animals are immune.\r\nWhich are they? Our first business is to list them if we would\r\nlearn the why of immunity.\r\n\r\nFrogs are among the happy ones. One day early in June I took a\r\nwood-frog in my hand. The mosquitoes swarmed about. In a few seconds\r\n30 were on my hand digging away; 10 were on my forefinger, 8 on my\r\nthumb; between these was the frog, a creature with many resemblances\r\nto man--red blood, a smooth, naked, soft skin, etc.--and yet not a\r\nmosquito attacked it. Scores had bled my hand before one alighted\r\non the frog, and it leaped off again as though the creature were\r\nred hot. The experiment repeated with another frog gave the same\r\nresult. Why? It can hardly be because the frog is cold-blooded,\r\nfor many birds also seem, to be immune, and their blood is warmer\r\nthan man's.\r\n\r\nNext, I took a live frog and rubbed it on my hand over an area\r\nmarked out with lead pencil; at first the place was wet, but in a\r\nfew seconds dry and rather shiny. I held up my hand till 50 mosquitoes\r\nhad alighted on it and begun to bore; of these, 4 alighted on the\r\nfroggy place, 3 at once tumbled off in haste, but one, No. 32, did\r\nsting me there. I put my tongue to the frog's back; it was slightly\r\nbitter.\r\n\r\nI took a black-gilled fungus from a manure pile to-day, rubbed a\r\nsmall area, and held my hand bare till 50 mosquitoes had settled\r\nand begun to sting; 7 of these alighted on the fungus juice, but\r\nmoved off at once, except the last; it stung, but at that time the\r\njuice was dry.\r\n\r\nMany other creatures, including some birds, enjoy immunity, but\r\nI note that mosquitoes did attack a dead crane; also they swarmed\r\nonto a widgeon plucked while yet warm, and bored in deep; but I\r\ndid not see any filling with blood.\r\n\r\nThere is another kind of immunity that is equally important and\r\nobscure. In the summer of 1904, Dr. Clinton L. Bagg, of New York,\r\nwent to Newfoundland for a fishing trip. The Codroy country was,\r\nas usual, plagued with mosquitoes, but as soon as the party crossed\r\ninto the Garnish River Valley, a land of woods and swamps like the\r\nother, the mosquitoes had disappeared. Dr. Bagg spent the month of\r\nAugust there, and found no use for nets, dopes, or other means of\r\nfighting winged pests; there were none. What the secret was no one\r\nat present knows, but it would be a priceless thing to find.\r\n\r\nNow, lest I should do injustice to the Northland that will some\r\nday be an empire peopled with white men, let me say that there are\r\nthree belts of mosquito country the Barren Grounds, where they are\r\nworst and endure for 2 1/2 months; the spruce forest, where they\r\nare bad and continue for 2 months, and the great arable region of\r\nwheat, that takes in Athabaska and Saskatchewan, where the flies\r\nare a nuisance for 6 or 7 weeks, but no more so than they were in\r\nOntario, Michigan, Manitoba, and formerly England; and where the\r\ncultivation of the land will soon reduce them to insignificance,\r\nas it has invariably done in other similar regions. It is quite\r\nremarkable in the north-west that such plagues are most numerous\r\nin the more remote regions, and they disappear in proportion as\r\nthe country is opened up and settled.\r\n\r\nFinally, it is a relief to know that these mosquitoes convey no\r\ndisease--even the far-spread malaria is unknown in the region.\r\n\r\nWhy did I not take a \"dope\" or  \"fly repellent,\" ask many of my\r\nfriends.\r\n\r\nIn answer I can only say I have never before been where mosquitoes\r\nwere bad enough to need one. I had had no experience with fly-dope.\r\nI had heard that they are not very effectual, and so did not add\r\none to the outfit. I can say now it was a mistake to leave any means\r\nuntried. Next time I carry \"dope.\" The following recipe is highly\r\nrecommended:\r\n\r\n\r\nPennyroyal,      one part,\r\nOil of Tar,         \"   \"\r\nSpirits of Camphor, \"   \"\r\nSweet Oil, or else vaseline, three parts.\r\n\r\n\r\nTheir natural enemies are numerous; most small birds prey on them;\r\ndragon-flies also, and the latter alone inspire fear in the pests.\r\nWhen a dragon-fly comes buzzing about one's head the mosquitoes\r\nmove away to the other side, but it makes no considerable difference.\r\n\r\nOn Buffalo River I saw a boatman or water-spider seize, and devour\r\na mosquito that fell within reach; which is encouraging, because,\r\nas a rule, the smaller the foe, the deadlier, and the only creature\r\nthat really affects the whole mosquito nation is apparently a small\r\nred parasite that became more and more numerous as the season wore\r\non. It appeared in red lumps on the bill and various parts of the\r\nstinger's body, and the victim became very sluggish. Specimens\r\nsent to Dr. L. 0. Howard, the authority on mosquitoes, elicited\r\nthe information that it was a fungus, probably new to science.\r\nBut evidently it is deadly to the Culex. More power to it, and the\r\ncause it represents; we cannot pray too much for its increase.\r\n\r\nNow to sum up: after considering the vastness of the region\r\naffected--three-quarters of the globe--and the number of diseases\r\nthese insects communicate, one is inclined to say that it might be\r\na greater boon to mankind to extirpate the mosquito than to stamp\r\nout tuberculosis. The latter means death to a considerable proportion\r\nof our race, the former means hopeless suffering to all mankind;\r\none takes off each year its toll of the weaklings the other spares\r\nnone, and in the far north at least has made a hell on earth of\r\nthe land that for six months of each year might be a human Paradise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nA BAD CASE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMy unsought fame as a medicine man continued to grow. One morning\r\nI heard a white voice outside asking, \"Is the doctor in?\" Billy\r\nreplied: \"Mr. Seton is inside.\" On going forth I met a young American\r\nwho thus introduced himself: \"My name is Y------, from Michigan.\r\nI was a student at Ann Arbor when you lectured there in 1903. 1\r\ndon't suppose you remember me; I was one of the reception committee;\r\nbut I'm mighty glad to meet you out here.\"\r\n\r\nAfter cordial greetings he held up his arm to explain the call and\r\nsaid: \"I'm in a pretty bad way.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let's see.\"\r\n\r\nHe unwound the bandage and showed a hand and arm swollen out of all\r\nshape, twice the natural size, and of a singular dropsical pallor.\r\n\r\n\"Have you any pain?\"\r\n\r\n\"I can't sleep from the torture of it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where does it hurt now?\"\r\n\r\n\"In the hand.\"\r\n\r\n\"How did you get it?\"\r\n\r\n\"It seemed to come on after a hard crossing of Lake Athabaska. We\r\nhad to row all night.\"\r\n\r\nI asked one or two more questions, really to hide my puzzlement.\r\n\"What in the world is it?\" I said to myself; \"all so fat and puffy.\"\r\nI cudgelled my brain for a clue. As I examined the hand in silence\r\nto play for time and conceal my ignorance, he went on:\r\n\r\n\"What I'm afraid of is blood-poisoning. I couldn't get out to a\r\ndoctor before a month, and by that time I'll be one-armed or dead.\r\nI know which I'd prefer.\"\r\n\r\nKnowing, at all events, that nothing but evil could come of fear,\r\nI said: \"Now see here. You can put that clean out of your mind.\r\nYou never saw blood-poisoning that colour, did you?\"\r\n\r\n\"That's so,\" and he seemed intensely relieved.\r\n\r\nWhile I was thus keeping up an air of omniscience by saying nothing,\r\nMajor Jarvis came up.\r\n\r\n\"Look at this, Jarvis,\" said I; \"isn't it a bad one?\r\n\r\n\"Phew,\" said the Major, \"that's the worst felon I ever saw.\"\r\n\r\nLike a gleam from heaven came the word felon. That's what it was,\r\na felon or whitlow, and again I breathed freely. Turning to the\r\npatient with my most cock-sure professional air, I said:\r\n\r\n\"Now see, Y., you needn't worry; you've hurt your finger in\r\nrowing, and the injury was deep and has set up a felon. It is not\r\nyet headed up enough; as soon as it is I'll lance it, unless it\r\nbursts of itself (and inwardly I prayed it might burst). Can you\r\nget any linseed meal or bran?\"\r\n\r\n\"Afraid not.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, then, get some clean rags and keep the place covered with\r\nthem dipped in water as hot as you can stand it, and we'll head\r\nit up in twenty-four hours; then in three days I'll have you in\r\ngood shape to travel.\" The last sentence, delivered with the calm\r\ncertainty of a man who knows all about it and never made a mistake,\r\ndid so much good to the patient that I caught a reflex of it myself.\r\n\r\nHe gave me his good hand and said with emotion: \"You don't know\r\nhow much good you have done me. I don't mind being killed, but I\r\ndon't want to go through life a cripple.\"\r\n\r\n\"You say you haven't slept?\" I asked.\r\n\r\n\"Not for three nights; I've suffered too much.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then take these pills. Go to bed at ten o'clock and take a pill;\r\nif this does not put you to sleep, take another at 10.30. If you are\r\nstill awake at 11, take the third; then you will certainly sleep.\"\r\n\r\nHe went off almost cheerfully.\r\n\r\nNext morning he was back, looking brighter. \"Well,\" I said, \"you\r\nslept last night, all right.\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" he replied, \"I didn't; there's opium in those pills, isn't\r\nthere?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"I thought so. Here they are. I made up my mind I'd see this out\r\nin my sober senses, without any drugs.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good for you,\" I exclaimed in admiration. \"They talk about Indian\r\nfortitude. If I had given one of those Indians some sleeping pills,\r\nhe'd have taken them all and asked for more. But you are the real\r\nAmerican stuff, the pluck that can't be licked, and I'll soon have\r\nyou sound as a dollar.\"\r\n\r\nThen he showed his immense bladder-like hand. \"I'll have to make\r\nsome preparation, and will operate in your shanty at 1 o'clock,\"\r\nI said, thinking how very professional it sounded.\r\n\r\nThe preparation consisted of whetting my penknife and, much more\r\nimportant, screwing up my nerves. And now I remembered my friend's\r\nbrandy, put the flask in my pocket, and went to the execution.\r\n\r\nHe was ready. \"Here,\" I said; \"take a good pull at this brandy.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will not,\" was the reply. \"I'm man enough to go through on my\r\nmettle.\"\r\n\r\n\"'Oh! confound your mettle,\" I thought, for I wanted an excuse to\r\ntake some myself, but could not for shame under the circumstances.\r\n\r\n\"Are you ready?\"\r\n\r\nHe laid his pudding-y hand on the table.\r\n\r\n\"You better have your Indian friend hold that hand.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll never budge,\" he replied, with set teeth, and motioned the\r\nIndian away. And I knew he would not flinch. He will never know\r\n(till he reads this, perhaps) what an effort it cost me. I knew only\r\nI must cut deep enough to reach the pus, not so deep as to touch\r\nthe artery, and not across the tendons, and must do it firmly, at\r\none clean stroke. I did.\r\n\r\nIt was a horrid success. He never quivered, but said: \"Is that all?\r\nThat's a pin-prick to what I've been through every minute for the\r\nlast week.\"\r\n\r\nI felt faint, went out behind the cabin, and--shall I confess\r\nit?--took a long swig of brandy. But I was as good as my promise:\r\nin three days he was well enough to travel, and soon as strong as\r\never.\r\n\r\nI wonder if real doctors ever conceal, under an air of professional\r\ncalm, just such doubts and fears as worried me.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nTHE SECOND BUFFALO HUNT\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThough so trifling, the success of our first Buffalo hunt gave us\r\nquite a social lift. The chiefs were equally surprised with the\r\nwhites, and when we prepared for a second expedition, Kiya sent\r\nword that though he could not act as guide, I should ride his own\r\ntrained hunter, a horse that could run a trail like a hound, and\r\nwas without guile.\r\n\r\nI am, always suspicious of a horse (or man) without guile.\r\nI wondered what was the particular weakness of this exceptionally\r\ntrained, noble, and guileless creature. I have only one prejudice\r\nin horseflesh--I do not like a white one. So, of course, when\r\nthe hunter arrived he was, white as marble, from mane to tail and\r\nhoofs; his very eyes were of a cheap china colour, suggestive of\r\ncataractine blindness. The only relief was a morbid tinge of faded\r\nshrimp pink in his nostrils and ears. But he proved better than he\r\nlooked. He certainly did run tracks by nose like a hound, provided I\r\nlet him choose the track. He was a lively walker and easy trotter,\r\nand would stay where the bridle was dropped, So I came to the\r\nconclusion that Kiya was not playing a joke on me, but really had\r\nlent me his best hunter, whose sepulchral whiteness I could see would\r\nbe of great advantage in snow time when chiefly one is supposed to\r\nhunt.\r\n\r\nNot only Kiya, but Pierre Squirrel, the head chief, seemed to harbour\r\na more kindly spirit. He now suddenly acquired a smattering of\r\nEnglish and a fair knowledge of French. He even agreed to lead us\r\nthrough his own hunting grounds to the big Buffalo range, stipulating\r\nthat we be back by July 1, as that was Treaty Day, when all the\r\ntribe assembled to receive their treaty money, and his presence as\r\nhead chief was absolutely necessary.\r\n\r\nWe were advised to start from Fort Smith, as the trail thence was\r\nthrough a dryer country; so on the morning of June 24, at 6.50, we\r\nleft the Fort on our second Buffalo hunt.\r\n\r\nMajor A. M. Jarvis, Mr. E. A. Preble, Corporal Selig, Chief Pierre\r\nSquirrel, and myself, all mounted, plus two pack-horses, prepared\r\nfor a week's campaign. Riding ahead in his yellow caftan and black\r\nburnoose was Pierre Squirrel on his spirited charger, looking most\r\npicturesque. But remembering that his yellow caftan was a mosquito\r\nnet, his black burnoose a Hudson's Bay coat, and his charger an\r\nornery Indian Cayuse, robbed the picture of most of its poetry.\r\n\r\nWe marched westerly 7 miles through fine, dry, jack-pine wood,\r\nthen, 3 miles through mixed poplar, pine, and spruce, And came to\r\nthe Slave River opposite Point Gravois. Thence we went a mile or\r\nso into similar woods, and after another stretch of muskegs. We\r\ncamped for lunch at 11.45, having covered 12 miles.\r\n\r\nAt two we set out, and reached Salt River at three, but did not\r\ncross there. It is a magnificent stream, 200 feet wide, with hard\r\nbanks and fine timber on each side; but its waters are brackish.\r\n\r\nWe travelled north-westerly, or northerly, along the east banks\r\nfor an hour, but at length away from it on a wide prairie, a mile\r\nor more across here, but evidently extending much farther behind\r\ninterruptions of willow clumps. Probably these prairies join, with\r\nthose we saw on the Beaulieu trip. They are wet now, though a horse\r\ncan go anywhere, and the grass is good. We camped about six on a dry\r\nplace back from the river. At night I was much interested to hear\r\nat intervals the familiar Kick-kick-kick-kick of the Yellow Rail\r\nin the adjoining swamps. This must be its northmost range; we did\r\nnot actually see it.\r\n\r\nHere I caught a garter-snake. Preble says it is the same form as\r\nthat at Edmonton. Our guide was as much surprised to see me take\r\nit in my hands, as he was to see me let it go unharmed.\r\n\r\nNext morning, after a short hour's travel, we came again to Salt\r\nRiver and proceeded to cross. Evidently Squirrel had selected the\r\nwrong place, for the sticky mud seemed bottomless, and we came near\r\nlosing two of the horses.\r\n\r\nAfter two hours we all got across and went on, but most of the horses\r\nhad shown up poorly, as spiritless creatures, not yet recovered\r\nfrom the effects of a hard winter.\r\n\r\nOur road now lay over the high upland of the Salt Mountain, among\r\nits dry and beautiful woods. The trip would have been glorious but\r\nfor the awful things that I am not allowed to mention outside of\r\nChapter IX.\r\n\r\nPierre proved a pleasant and intelligent companion; he did his\r\nbest, but more than once shook his head and said: \"Chevaux no good.\"\r\n\r\nWe covered 15 miles before night, and all day we got glimpses of\r\nsome animal on our track, 300 yards behind in the woods. It might\r\neasily have been a Wolf, but at night he sneaked into camp a forlorn\r\nand starving Indian dog. Next day we reached the long looked-for\r\nLittle Buffalo River. Several times of late Pierre had commented on\r\nthe slowness of our horses and enlarged on the awful Muskega that\r\ncovered the country west of the Little Buffalo. Now he spoke out\r\nfrankly and said we had been 21 days coming 40 miles when the road\r\nwas good; we were now coming to very bad roads and had to go as\r\nfar again. These horses could not do it, and get him back to Fort\r\nSmith for July 1--and back at any price he must be.\r\n\r\nHe was willing to take the whole outfit half a day farther westward,\r\nor, if we preferred it, he would go afoot or on horseback with the\r\npick of the men and horses for a hasty dash forward; but to take\r\nthe whole outfit on to the Buffalo country and get back on time\r\nwas not possible.\r\n\r\nThis was a bad shake. We held a council of war, and the things that\r\nwere said of that Indian should have riled him if he understood.\r\nHe preserved his calm demeanour; probably this was one of the\r\nconvenient times when all his English forsook him. We were simply\r\nraging: to be half-way to our goal, with abundance of provisions,\r\nfine weather, good health and everything promising well, and then\r\nto be balked because our guide wanted to go back. I felt as savage\r\nas the others, but on calmer reflection pointed out that Pierre\r\ntold us before starting that he must be back for Treaty Day, and\r\neven now he was ready to do his best.\r\n\r\nThen in a calm of the storm (which he continued to ignore) Pierre\r\nturned to me and said: \"Why don't you go back and try the canoe\r\nroute? You can go down the Great River to Grand Detour, then portage\r\n8 miles over to the Buffalo, go down this to the Nyarling, then up\r\nthe Nyarling into the heart of the Buffalo country; 21 days will\r\ndo it, and it will be easy, for there is plenty of water and no\r\nrapids,\" and he drew a fairly exact map which showed that he knew\r\nthe country thoroughly.\r\n\r\nThere was nothing to be gained by going half a day farther.\r\n\r\nTo break up our party did not fit in at all with our plans, so, after\r\nanother brief stormy debate in which the guide took no part, we\r\nturned without crossing the Little Buffalo, and silently, savagely,\r\nbegan the homeward journey; as also did the little Indian dog.\r\n\r\nNext morning we crossed the Salt River at a lower place where was\r\na fine, hard bottom. That afternoon we travelled for 6 miles through\r\na beautiful and level country, covered with a forest of large poplars,\r\nnot very thick; it will some day be an ideal cattle-range, for it\r\nhad rank grass everywhere, and was varied by occasional belts of\r\njack-pine. In one of these Preble found a nest with six eggs that\r\nproved to be those of the Bohemian Chatterer. These he secured,\r\nwith photograph of the nest and old bird. It was the best find of\r\nthe journey.\r\n\r\nThe eggs proved of different incubation--at least a week's\r\ndifference--showing that the cool nights necessitated immediate\r\nsetting.\r\n\r\nWe camped at Salt River mouth, and next afternoon were back at Fort\r\nSmith, having been out five days and seen nothing, though there\r\nwere tracks of Moose and Bear in abundance.\r\n\r\nHere our guide said good-bye to us, and so did the Indian dog.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nBEZKYA AND THE PILLS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring this journey I had successfully treated two of the men for\r\nslight ailments, and Squirrel had made mental note of the fact.\r\nA result of it was that in the morning an old, old, black-looking\r\nIndian came hobbling on a stick to my tent and, in husky Chipewyan,\r\nroughly translated by Billy, told me that he had pains in his head\r\nand his shoulder and his body, and his arms and his legs and his\r\nfeet, and he couldn't hunt, couldn't fish, couldn't walk, couldn't\r\neat, couldn't lie, couldn't sleep, and he wanted me to tackle\r\nthe case. I hadn't the least idea of what ailed the old chap, but\r\nconveyed no hint of my darkness. I put on my very medical look\r\nand said: \"Exactly so. Now you take these pills and you will find\r\na wonderful difference in the morning.\" I had some rather fierce\r\nrhubarb pills; one was a dose but, recognising the necessity for\r\neclat, I gave him two.\r\n\r\nHe gladly gulped them down in water. The Indian takes kindly to\r\npills, it's so easy to swallow them, so obviously productive of\r\nresults, and otherwise satisfactory. Then, the old man hobbled off\r\nto his lodge.\r\n\r\nA few hours later he was back again, looking older and shakier\r\nthan ever, his wet red eyes looking like plague spots in his ashy\r\nbrown visage or like volcanic eruptions in a desert of dead lava,\r\nand in husky, clicking accents he told Billy to tell the Okimow\r\nthat the pills were no good--not strong enough for him.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" I said, \"he shall surely have results this time.\" I gave\r\nhim three big ones in a cup of hot tea. All the Indians love tea,\r\nand it seems to help them. Under its cheering power the old man's\r\ntongue was loosened. He talked more clearly, and Billy, whose\r\nknowledge of Chipewyan is fragmentary at best, suddenly said: \"I'm\r\nafraid I made, a mistake. Bezkya says the pills are too strong.\r\nCan't you give him something to stop them?\r\n\r\n\"Goodness,\" I thought; \"here's a predicament,\" but I didn't know\r\nwhat to do. I remembered a western adage, \"When you don't know a\r\nthing to do, don't do a thing.\" I only said: \"Tell Bezkya to go home,\r\ngo to bed, and stay there till to-morrow, then come here again.\"\r\n\r\nAway went the Indian to his lodge. I felt rather uneasy that day\r\nand night, and the next morning looked with some eagerness for the\r\nreturn of Bezkya. But he did not come and I began to grow unhappy.\r\nI wanted some evidence that I had not done him an injury. I wished\r\nto see him, but professional etiquette forbade me betraying myself\r\nby calling on him. Noon came and no Bezkya; late afternoon, and\r\nthen I sallied forth, not to seek him, but to pass near his lodge,\r\nas though I were going to the Hudson's Bay store. And there, to my\r\nhorror, about the lodge I saw a group of squaws, with shawls over\r\ntheir heads, whispering, together. As I went by, all turned as one\r\nof them pointed at me, and again they whispered.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, heavens!\" I thought; \"I've killed the old man.\" But still\r\nI would not go in. That night I did not sleep for worrying about\r\nit. Next morning I was on the point of sending Billy to learn the\r\nstate of affairs, when who should come staggering up but old Bezkya.\r\nHe was on two crutches now, his complexion was a dirty gray, and\r\nhis feeble knees were shaking, but he told Billy--yes, unmistakably\r\nthis time--to tell the Okimow that that was great medicine I had\r\ngiven him, and he wanted a dose just like it for his wife.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\nFORT SMITH AND THE SOCIAL QUEEN\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSeveral times during our river journey I heard reference to\r\nan extraordinary woman in the lower country, one who gave herself\r\ngreat airs, put on style, who was so stuck up, indeed, that she had\r\n\"two pots, one for tea, one for coffee.\" Such incredible pomposity\r\nand arrogance naturally invited sarcastic comment from all the\r\nworld, and I was told I should doubtless see this remarkable person\r\nat Fort Smith.\r\n\r\nAfter the return from Buffalo hunt No. 2, and pending arrangements\r\nfor hunt No. 3, 1 saw more of Fort Smith than I wished for, but\r\nendeavoured to turn the time to account by copying out interesting\r\nchapters from the rough semi-illegible, perishable manuscript\r\naccounts of northern life called \"old-timers.\" The results of this\r\nlibrary research work appear under the chapter heads to which they\r\nbelong.\r\n\r\nAt each of these northern posts there were interesting experiences\r\nin store for me, as one who had read all the books of northern travel\r\nand dreamed for half a lifetime of the north; and that was--almost\r\ndaily meeting with famous men. I suppose it would be similar if\r\none of these men were to go to London or Washington and have some\r\none tell him: that gentle old man there is Lord Roberts, or that\r\nmeek, shy, retiring person is Speaker Cannon; this on the first\r\nbench is Lloyd-George, or that with the piercing eyes is Aldrich,\r\nthe uncrowned King of America. So it was a frequent and delightful\r\nexperience to meet with men whose names have figured in books of\r\ntravel for a generation. This was Roderick MacFarlane, who founded\r\nFort Anderson, discovered the MacFarlane Rabbit, etc.; here was\r\nJohn Schott, who guided Caspar Whitney; that was Hanbury's head\r\nman; here was Murdo McKay, who travelled with Warburton Pike in\r\nthe Barrens and starved with him on Peace River; and so with many\r\nmore.\r\n\r\nVery few of these men had any idea of the interest attaching\r\nto their observations. Their notion of values centres chiefly on\r\nthings remote from their daily life. It was very surprising to see\r\nhow completely one may be outside of the country he lives in. Thus\r\nI once met a man who had lived sixteen years in northern Ontario,\r\nhad had his chickens stolen every year by Foxes, and never in his\r\nlife had seen a Fox. I know many men who live in Wolf country, and\r\nhear them at least every week, but have never seen one in twenty\r\nyears' experience. Quite recently I saw a score of folk who had\r\nlived in the porcupiniest part of the Adirondacks for many summers\r\nand yet never saw a Porcupine, and did not know what it was when\r\nI brought one into their camp. So it was not surprising to me to\r\nfind that although living in a country that swarmed with Moose, in\r\na village which consumes at least a hundred Moose per annum, there\r\nwere at Fort Smith several of the Hudson's Bay men that had lived\r\non Moose meat all their lives and yet had never seen a live Moose.\r\nIt sounds like a New Yorker saying he had never seen a stray cat.\r\nBut I was simply dumfounded by a final development in the same line.\r\n\r\nQuite the most abundant carpet in the forest here is the uva-ursi\r\nor bear-berry. Its beautiful evergreen leaves and bright red berries\r\ncover a quarter of the ground in dry woods and are found in great\r\nacre beds. It furnishes a staple of food to all wild things, birds\r\nand beasts, including Foxes, Martens, and Coyotes; it is one of the\r\nmost abundant of the forest products, and not one hundred yards from\r\nthe fort are solid patches as big as farms, and yet when I brought\r\nin a spray to sketch it one day several of the Hudson's Bay officers\r\nsaid: \"Where in the world did you get that? It must be very rare,\r\nfor I never yet saw it in this country.\" A similar remark was made\r\nabout a phoebe-bird. \"It was never before seen in the country\"; and\r\nyet there is a pair nesting every quarter of a mile from Athabaska\r\nLanding to Great Slave Lake.\r\n\r\nFort Smith, being the place of my longest stay, was the scene of\r\nmy largest medical practice.\r\n\r\nOne of my distinguished patients here was Jacob McKay, a half-breed\r\nborn on Red River in 1840. He left there in 1859 to live 3 years\r\nat Rat Portage. Then he went to Norway House, and after 3 years\r\nmoved to Athabaska in 1865. In 1887 he headed a special government\r\nexpedition into the Barren Grounds to get some baby Musk-ox skins.\r\nHe left Fort Rae, April 25, 1887, and, travelling due north with\r\nDogrib Indians some 65 miles, found Musk-ox on May 10, and later\r\nsaw many hundreds. They killed 16 calves for their pelts, but no\r\nold ones. McKay had to use all his influence to keep the Indians\r\nfrom slaughtering wholesale; indeed, it was to restrain them that\r\nhe was sent.\r\n\r\nHe now lives at Fort Resolution.\r\n\r\nOne morning the chief came and said he wanted me to doctor a sick\r\nwoman in his lodge. I thought sick women a good place for an amateur\r\nto draw the line, but Squirrel did not. \"Il faut venir; elle est\r\nbien malade.\"\r\n\r\nAt length I took my pill-kit and followed him. Around his lodge\r\nwere a score of the huge sled dogs, valuable animals in winter,\r\nbut useless, sullen, starving, noisy nuisances all summer. If you\r\nkick them out of your way, they respect you; if you pity them, they\r\nbite you. They respected us.\r\n\r\nWe entered the lodge, and there sitting by the fire were two squaws\r\nmaking moccasins. One was old and ugly as sin; the second, young\r\nand pretty as a brown fawn. I looked from one to the other in doubt,\r\nand said:\r\n\r\n\"Laquelle est la malade?\"\r\n\r\nThen the pretty one replied in perfect English: \"You needn't talk\r\nFrench here; I speak English,' which she certainly did. French is\r\nmostly used, but the few that speak English are very proud of it\r\nand are careful to let you know.\r\n\r\n\"Are you ill?\" I asked.\r\n\r\n\"The chief thinks I am,\" was the somewhat impatient reply, and she\r\nbroke down in a coughing fit.\r\n\r\n\"How long have you had that?\" I said gravely.\r\n\r\n\"What?\"\r\n\r\nI tapped my chest for reply.\r\n\r\n\"Oh! since last spring.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you had it the spring before, too, didn't you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, yes! (a pause). But that isn't what bothers me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Isn't your husband kind to you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes--sometimes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is this your husband?\"\r\n\r\n\"No! F----- B----- is; I am K-----.\"\r\n\r\nAgain she was interrupted by coughing.\r\n\r\n\"Would you like something to ease that cough?\" I asked.\r\n\r\n\"No! It isn't the body that's sick; it's the heart.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you wish to tell me about it?\"\r\n\r\n\"I lost my babies.\"\r\n\r\n\"'When?\"\r\n\r\n\"Two years ago. I had two little ones, and both died in one month.\r\nI am left much alone; my husband is away on the transport; our\r\nlodge is nearby. The chief has all these dogs; they bark at every\r\nlittle thing and disturb me, so I lie awake all night and think\r\nabout my babies. But that isn't the hardest thing.\"\r\n\r\n\"What is it?\"\r\n\r\nShe hesitated, then burst out: \"The tongues of the women. You don't\r\nknow what a hell of a place this is to live in. The women here don't\r\nmind their work; they sit all day watching for a chance to lie about\r\ntheir neighbours. If I am seen talking to you now, a story will be\r\nmade of it. If I walk to the store for a pound of tea, a story is\r\nmade of that. If I turn my head, another story; and everything is\r\ncarried to my husband to make mischief. It is nothing but lies,\r\nlies, lies, all day, all night, all year. Women don't do that way\r\nin your country, do they?\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" I replied emphatically. \"If any woman in my country were\r\nto tell a lie to make another woman unhappy, she would be thought\r\nvery, very wicked.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am sure of it,\" she said. \"I wish I could go to your country\r\nand be at rest.\" She turned to her work and began talking to the\r\nothers in Chipewyan.\r\n\r\nNow another woman entered. She was dressed in semi-white style,\r\nand looked, not on the ground, as does an Indian woman, on seeing\r\na strange man, but straight at me.\r\n\r\n\"Bon jour, madame,\" I said.\r\n\r\n\"I speak Ingliss,\" she replied with emphasis.\r\n\r\n\"Indeed! And what is your name?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am Madame X-------.\"\r\n\r\nAnd now I knew I was in the presence of the stuckup social queen.\r\n\r\nAfter some conversation she said: \"I have some things at home you\r\nlike to see.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where is your lodge?\" I asked.\r\n\r\n\"Lodge,\" she replied indignantly; \"I have no lodge. I know ze Indian\r\nway. I know ze half-breed way. I know ze white man's way. I go ze\r\nwhite man's way. I live in a house--and my door is painted blue.\"\r\n\r\nI went to her house, a 10 by 12 log cabin; but the door certainly\r\nwas painted blue, a gorgeous sky blue, the only touch of paint in\r\nsight. Inside was all one room, with a mud fireplace at one end\r\nand some piles of rags in the corners for beds, a table, a chair,\r\nand some pots. On the walls snow-shoes, fishing-lines, dried fish\r\nin smellable bunches, a portrait of the Okapi from Outing, and a\r\nmusical clock that played with painful persistence the first three\r\nbars of \"God Save the King.\" Everywhere else were rags, mud, and\r\ndirt. \"You see, I am joost like a white woman,\" said the swarthy\r\nqueen. \"I wear boots (she drew her bare brown feet and legs under\r\nher) and corsets. Zey are la,\" and she pointed to the wall, where,\r\nin very truth, tied up with a bundle of dried fish, were the articles\r\nin question. Not simply boots and corsets, but high-heeled Louis\r\nQuinze slippers and French corsets. I learned afterward how they\r\nwere worn. When she went shopping to the H. B. Co. store she had\r\nto cross the \"parade\" ground, the great open space; she crowded her\r\nbrown broad feet into the slippers, then taking a final good long\r\nbreath she strapped on the fearfully tight corsets outside of all.\r\nNow she hobbled painfully across the open, proudly conscious that\r\nthe eyes of the world were upon her. Once in the store she would\r\nunhook the corsets and breathe comfortably till the agonized\r\ntriumphant return parade was in order.\r\n\r\nThis, however, is aside; we are still in the home of the queen. She\r\ncontinued to adduce new evidences. \"I am just like a white woman.\r\nI call my daughter darrr-leeng.\" Then turning to a fat, black-looking\r\nsquaw by the fire, she said: \"Darrr-leeng, go fetch a pail of\r\nvaw-taire.\"\r\n\r\nBut darling, if familiar with that form of address, must have been\r\nslumbering, for she never turned or moved a hair's-breadth or gave\r\na symptom of intelligence.  Now, at length it transpired that the\r\nsocial leader wished to see me professionally.\r\n\r\n\"It is ze nairves,\" she explained. \"Zere is too much going on in\r\nthis village. I am fatigue, very tired. I wish I could go away to\r\nsome quiet place for a long rest.\"\r\n\r\nIt was difficult to think of a place, short of the silent tomb,\r\nthat would be obviously quieter than Fort Smith. So I looked wise,\r\nworked on her faith with a pill, assured her that she would soon\r\nfeel much better, and closed the blue door behind me.\r\n\r\nWith Chief Squirrel, who had been close by in most of this, I now\r\nwalked back to my tent. He told me of many sick folk and sad lodges\r\nthat needed me.\r\n\r\nIt seems that very few of these people are well. In spite of their\r\nhealthy forest lives they are far less sound than an average white\r\ncommunity. They have their own troubles, with the white man's maladies\r\nthrown in. I saw numberless other cases of dreadful, hopeless,\r\ndevastating diseases, mostly of the white man's importation. It is\r\nheart-rending to see so much human misery and be able to do nothing\r\nat all for it, not even bring a gleam of hope. It made me feel like\r\na murderer to tell one after another, who came to me covered with\r\ncankerous bone-eating sores, \"I can do nothing\"; and I was deeply\r\ntouched by the simple statement of the Chief Pierre Squirrel, after\r\na round of visits: \"You see how unhappy we are, how miserable and\r\nsick. When I made this treaty with your government, I stipulated\r\nthat we should have here a policeman and a doctor; instead of that\r\nyou have sent nothing but missionaries.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\nRABBITS AND LYNXES IN THE NORTH-WEST\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are no Rabbits in the north-west. This statement, far from\r\nfinal, is practically true to-day, but I saw plenty of Lynxes, and\r\none cannot write of ducks without mentioning water.\r\n\r\nAll wild animals fluctuate greatly in their population, none\r\nmore so than the Snowshoe or white-rabbit of the north-west. This\r\nis Rabbit history as far back as known: They are spread over some\r\ngreat area; conditions are favourable; some unknown influence endows\r\nthe females with unusual fecundity; they bear not one, but two or\r\nthree broods in a season, and these number not 2 or 3, but 8 or 10\r\neach brood. The species increases far beyond the powers of predaceous\r\nbirds or beasts to check, and the Rabbits after 7 or 8 years of\r\nthis are multiplied into untold millions. On such occasions every\r\nlittle thicket has a Rabbit in it; they jump out at every 8 or 10\r\nfeet; they number not less than 100 to the acre on desirable ground,\r\nwhich means over 6,000 to the square mile, and a region as large as\r\nAlberta would contain not less than 100,000,000 fat white bunnies.\r\nAt this time one man can readily kill 100 or 200 Rabbits in a day,\r\nand every bird and beast of prey is slaughtering Rabbits without\r\nrestraint. Still they increase. Finally, they are so extraordinarily\r\nsuperabundant that they threaten their own food supply as well as\r\npoison all the ground. A new influence appears on the scene; it is\r\ncommonly called the plague, though it is not one disease but many\r\nrun epidemic riot, and, in a few weeks usually, the Rabbits are\r\nwiped out.\r\n\r\nThis is an outline of the established routine in Rabbit vital\r\nstatistics. It, of course, varies greatly in every detail, including\r\ntime and extent of territory involved, and when the destruction is\r\ncomplete it is an awful thing for the carnivores that have lived\r\non the bunny millions and multiplied in ratio with their abundance.\r\nOf all the northern creatures none are more dependent on the Rabbits\r\nthan is the Canada Lynx. It lives on Rabbits, follows the Rabbits,\r\nthinks Rabbits, tastes like Rabbits, increases with them, and on\r\ntheir failure dies of starvation in the unrabbited woods.\r\n\r\nIt must have been a Hibernian familiar with the north that said:\r\n\"A Lynx is nothing but an animated Rabbit anyway.\"\r\n\r\nThe Rabbits of the Mackenzie River Valley reached their flood\r\nheight in the winter of 1903-4. That season, it seems, they actually\r\nreached billions.\r\n\r\nLate the same winter the plague appeared, but did not take them at\r\none final swoop. Next winter they were still numerous, but in 1907\r\nthere seemed not one Rabbit left alive in the country. All that\r\nsummer we sought for them and inquired for them. We saw signs of\r\nmillions in the season gone by; everywhere were acres of saplings\r\nbarked at the snow-line; the floor of the woods, in all parts visited,\r\nwas pebbled over with pellets; but we saw not one Woodrabbit and\r\nheard only a vague report of 3 that an Indian claimed he had seen\r\nin a remote part of the region late in the fall.\r\n\r\nThen, since the Lynx is the logical apex of a pyramid of Rabbits,\r\nit naturally goes down when the Rabbits are removed.\r\n\r\nThese bobtailed cats are actually starving and ready to enter\r\nany kind of a trap or snare that carries a bait. The slaughter of\r\nLynxes in its relation to the Rabbit supply is shown by the H. B.\r\nCompany fur returns as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 1900, number of skins taken 4,473\r\n \" 1901            \"           5,781\r\n \" 1902            \"           9,117\r\n \" 1903            \"          19,267\r\n \" 1904            \"          36,116\r\n \" 1905            \"          58,850\r\n \" 1906            \"          61,388\r\n \" 1907            \"          36,201\r\n \" 1908            \"           9,664\r\n\r\n\r\nRemembering, then, that the last of the Rabbits were wiped out in\r\nthe winter of 1906-7, it will be understood that there were thousands\r\nof starving Lynxes roaming about the country. The number that we\r\nsaw, and their conditions, all helped to emphasise the dire story\r\nof plague and famine.\r\n\r\nSome of my notes are as follows:\r\n\r\nMay 18th, Athabaska River, on roof of a trapper's hut found the\r\nbodies of 30 Lynxes.\r\n\r\nMay 19th, young Lynx shot to-day, female, very thin, weighed only\r\n12 1/2 lbs., should have weighed 25. In its stomach nothing but\r\nthe tail of a white-footed mouse. Liver somewhat diseased. In its\r\nbowels at least one tapeworm.\r\n\r\nJune 3d, a young male Lynx shot to-day by one of the police boys,\r\nas previously recorded. Starving; it weighed only 15 lbs.\r\n\r\nJune 6th, adult female Lynx killed, weighed 15 lbs.; stomach contained\r\na Redsquirrel, a Chipmunk, and a Bog-lemming. (Synaptomys borealis.)\r\n\r\nJune 18th, young male Lynx, weight 13 lbs., shot by Preble on Smith\r\nLanding; had in its stomach a Chipmunk (borealis) and 4 small young\r\nof the same, apparently a week old; also a score of pinworms. How\r\ndid it get the Chipmunk family without digging them out?\r\n\r\nJune 26th, on Salt Mt. found the dried-up body of a Lynx firmly\r\nheld in a Bear trap.\r\n\r\nJune 29th, one of the Jarvis bear-cub skins was destroyed by the\r\ndogs, except a dried-up paw, which he threw out yesterday. This\r\nmorning one of the men shot a starving Lynx in camp. Its stomach\r\ncontained nothing but the bear paw thrown out last night.\r\n\r\nThese are a few of my observations; they reflect the general\r\ncondition--all were starving. Not one of them had any Rabbit in its\r\nstomach; not one had a bellyful; none of the females were bearing\r\nyoung this year.\r\n\r\nTo embellish these severe and skeletal notes, I add some incidents\r\nsupplied by various hunters of the north.\r\n\r\nLet us remember that the Lynx is a huge cat weighing 25 to 35 or\r\neven 40 lbs., that it is an ordinary cat multiplied by some 4 or\r\n5 diameters, and we shall have a good foundation for comprehension.\r\n\r\nMurdo McKay has often seen 2 or 3 Lynxes together in March, the\r\nmating season. They fight, and caterwaul like a lot of tomcats.\r\n\r\nThe uncatlike readiness of the Lynx to take to water is well known;\r\nthat it is not wholly at home there is shown by the fact that if\r\none awaits a Lynx at the landing he is making for, he will not turn\r\naside in the least, but come right on to land, fight, and usually\r\nperish.\r\n\r\nThe ancient feud between cat and dog is not forgotten in the north,\r\nfor the Lynx is the deadly foe of the Fox and habitually kills it\r\nwhen there is soft snow and scarcity of easier prey. Its broad feet\r\nare snowshoes enabling it to trot over the surface on Reynard's\r\ntrail. The latter easily runs away at first, but sinking deeply\r\nat each bound, his great speed is done in 15 or 6 miles; the Lynx\r\nkeeps on the same steady trot and finally claims its victim.\r\n\r\nJohn Bellecourt related that in the January of 1907, at a place 40\r\nmiles south of Smith Landing, he saw in the snow where a Lynx bad\r\nrun down and devoured a Fox.\r\n\r\nA contribution by T. Anderson runs thus:\r\n\r\nIn late March, 1907, an Indian named Amil killed a Caribou near\r\nFort Rae. During his absence a Lynx came along and gorged itself\r\nwith the meat, then lay down alongside to sleep. A Silver Fox came\r\nnext; but the Lynx sprang on him and killed him. When Amil came\r\nback he found the Fox and got a large sum for the skin; one shoulder\r\nwas torn. He did not see the Lynx but saw the tracks.\r\n\r\nThe same old-timer is authority for a case in which the tables were\r\nturned.\r\n\r\nA Desert Indian on the headwaters of the Gatineau went out in the\r\nearly spring looking for Beaver. At a well-known pond he saw a\r\nLynx crouching on a log, watching the Beaver hole in the ice. The\r\nIndian waited. At length a Beaver came up cautiously and crawled\r\nout to a near bunch of willows; the Lynx sprang, but the Beaver\r\nwas well under way and dived into the hole with the Lynx hanging\r\nto him. After a time the Indian took a crotched pole and fished\r\nabout under the ice; at last he found something soft and got it\r\nout; it was the Lynx drowned.\r\n\r\nBelalise ascribes another notable achievement to this animal.\r\n\r\nOne winter when hunting Caribou near Fond du Lac with an Indian\r\nnamed Tenahoo (human tooth), they saw a Lynx sneaking along after\r\nsome Caribou; they saw it coming but had not sense enough to run\r\naway. It sprang on the neck of a young buck; the buck bounded away\r\nwith the Lynx riding, but soon fell dead. The hunters came up;\r\nthe Lynx ran off. There was little blood and no large wound on the\r\nbuck; probably its neck was broken. The Indian said the Lynx always\r\nkills with its paw, and commonly kills Deer. David MacPherson\r\ncorroborates this and maintains that on occasion it will even kill\r\nMoose.\r\n\r\nIn southern settlements, where the Lynx is little known, it is\r\npainted as a fearsome beast of limitless ferocity, strength, and\r\nactivity. In the north, where it abounds and furnishes staple furs\r\nand meat, it is held in no such awe. It is never known to attack\r\nman. It often follows his trail out of curiosity, and often the\r\ntrapper who is so followed gets the Lynx by waiting in ambush; then\r\nit is easily killed with a charge of duck-shot. When caught in a\r\nsnare a very small club is used to \"add it to the list.\" It seems\r\ntremendously active among logs and brush piles, but on the level\r\nground its speed is poor, and a good runner can overtake one in a\r\nfew hundred yards.\r\n\r\nDavid MacPherson says that last summer he ran down a Lynx on a\r\nprairie of Willow River (Mackenzie), near Providence. It had some\r\n90 yards start; he ran it down in about a mile, then it turned to\r\nfight and he shot it.\r\n\r\nOther instances have been recorded, and finally, as noted later,\r\nI was eye-witness of one of these exploits. Since the creature can\r\nbe run down on hard ground, it is not surprising to learn that men\r\non snow-shoes commonly pursue it successfully. As long as it trots\r\nit is safe, but when it gets alarmed and bounds it sinks and becomes\r\nexhausted. It runs in a circle of about a mile, and at last takes\r\nto a tree where it is easily killed. At least one-third are taken\r\nin this way; it requires half an hour to an hour, there must be\r\nsoft snow, and the Lynx must be scared so he leaps; then he sinks;\r\nif not scared he glides along on his hairy snow-shoes, refuses\r\nto tree, and escapes in thick woods, where the men cannot follow\r\nquickly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\nEBB AND FLOW OF ANIMAL LIFE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThroughout this voyage we were struck by the rarity of some sorts\r\nof animals and the continual remarks that three, five, or six years\r\nago these same sorts were extremely abundant; and in some few cases\r\nthe conditions were reversed.\r\n\r\nFor example, during a week spent at Fort Smith, Preble had out a\r\nline of 50 mouse-traps every night and caught only one  Shrew and\r\none Meadowmouse in the week. Four years before he had trapped on\r\nexactly the same ground, catching 30 or 40 Meadowmice every night.\r\n\r\nAgain, in 1904 it was possible to see 100 Muskrats any fine evening.\r\nIn 1907, though continually on the lookout, I saw less than a score\r\nin six months. Redsquirrels varied in the same way.\r\n\r\nOf course, the Rabbits themselves were the extreme case, millions\r\nin 1904, none at all in 1907. The present, then, was a year of low\r\nebb. The first task was to determine whether this related to all\r\nmammalian life. Apparently not, because Deermice, Lynxes, Beaver,\r\nand Caribou were abundant. Yet these are not their maximum years;\r\nthe accounts show them to have been so much more numerous last\r\nyear.\r\n\r\nThere is only one continuous statistical record of the abundance\r\nof animals, that is the returns of the fur trade. These have been\r\nkept for over 200 years, and if we begin after the whole continent\r\nwas covered by fur-traders, they are an accurate gauge of the\r\nabundance of each species. Obviously, this must be so, for the whole\r\ncountry is trapped over every year, all the furs are marketed, most\r\nof them through the Hudson's Bay Company, and whatever falls into\r\nother hands is about the same percentage each year, therefore the\r\nH. B. Co. returns are an accurate gauge of the relative rise and\r\nfall of the population.\r\n\r\nThrough the courtesy of its officials I have secured the Company's\r\nreturns for the 85 years--1821-1905 inclusive. I take 1821 as the\r\nstarting-point, as that was the first year when the whole region\r\nwas covered by the Hudson's Bay Company to the exclusion of all\r\nimportant rivals.\r\n\r\nFirst, I have given these accounts graphic tabulation, and at once\r\nmany interesting facts are presented to the eye. The Rabbit line\r\nprior to 1845 is not reliable. Its subsequent close coincidence\r\nwith that of Lynx, Marten, Skunk, and Fox is evidently cause and\r\neffect.\r\n\r\nThe Mink coincides fairly well with Skunk and Marten.\r\n\r\nThe Muskrat's variation probably has relation chiefly to the amount\r\nof water, which, as is well known, is cyclic in the north-West.\r\n\r\nThe general resemblance of Beaver and Otter lines may not mean\r\nanything. If, as said, the Otter occasionally preys on the Beaver,\r\nthese lines should in some degree correspond.\r\n\r\nThe Wolf line does not manifest any special relationship and seems\r\nto be in a class by itself. The great destruction from 1840 to 1870\r\nwas probably due to strychnine, newly introduced about then.\r\n\r\nThe Bear, Badger, and Wolverine go along with little variation.\r\nProbably the Coon does the same; the enormous rise in 1867 from\r\nan average of 3,500 per annum. to 24,000 was most likely a result\r\nof accidental accumulation and not representative of any special\r\nabundance. Finally, each and every line manifests extraordinary\r\nvariability in the '30's. It is not to be supposed that the\r\npopulation fluctuated so enormously from one year to another, but\r\nrather that the facilities for export were irregular.\r\n\r\nThe case is further complicated by the fact that some of the totals\r\nrepresent part of this year and part of last; nevertheless, upon\r\nthe whole, the following general principles are deducible:\r\n\r\n(a) The high points for each species are with fair regularity 10\r\nyears apart.\r\n\r\n(b) In the different species these are not exactly coincident.\r\n\r\n(c) To explain the variations we must seek not the reason for the\r\nincrease--that is normal--but for the destructive agency that ended\r\nthe increase.\r\n\r\nThis is different in three different groups.\r\n\r\nFirst. The group whose food and enemies fluctuate but little. The\r\nonly examples of this on our list are the Muskrat and Beaver, more\r\nespecially the Muskrat. Its destruction seems to be due to a sudden\r\ngreat rise of the water after the ice has formed, so that the Rats\r\nare drowned; or to a dry season followed by severe frost, freezing\r\nmost ponds to the bottom, so that the Rats are imprisoned and starve\r\nto death, or are forced out to cross the country in winter, and so\r\nare brought within the power of innumerable enemies.\r\n\r\nHow tremendously this operates may be judged by these facts. In\r\n1900 along the Mackenzie I was assured one could shoot 20 Muskrats\r\nin an hour after sundown. Next winter the flood followed the\r\nfrost and the Rats seemed to have been wiped out. In 1907 1 spent\r\n6 months outdoors in the region and saw only 17 Muskrats the whole\r\ntime; in 1901 the H. B. Co. exported over 11 millions; in 1907,\r\n407,472. The fact that they totalled as high was due, no doubt, to\r\ntheir abundance in eastern regions not affected by the disaster.\r\n\r\nSecond. The group that increases till epidemic disease attacks\r\ntheir excessively multiplied hordes. The Snowshoe-Rabbit is the\r\nonly well-known case today, but there is reason for the belief that\r\nonce the Beaver were subjected to a similar process. Concerning the\r\nMice and Lemmings, I have not complete data, but they are believed\r\nto multiply and suffer in the same, way.\r\n\r\nThird. The purely carnivorous, whose existence is dependent on the\r\nRabbits. This includes chiefly the Lynx and Fox, but in less degree\r\nall the small carnivores.\r\n\r\nIn some cases such as the Marten, over-feeding seems as inimical\r\nto multiplication as under-feeding, and it will be seen that each\r\nyear of great increase for this species coincided with a medium\r\nyear for Rabbits.\r\n\r\nBut the fundamental and phenomenal case is that of the Rabbits\r\nthemselves. And in solving this we are confronted by the generally\r\nattested facts that when on the increase they have two or three\r\nbroods each season and 8 to 10 in a brood; when they are decreasing\r\nthey have but one brood and only 2 or 3 in that. This points to some\r\nobscure agency at work; whether it refers simply to the physical\r\nvigour of the fact, or to some uncomprehended magnetic or heliological\r\ncycle, is utterly unknown.\r\n\r\nThe practical consideration for the collecting naturalist is this:\r\nBeaver, Muskrat, Otter, Fisher, Raccoon, Badger, Wolverine, Wolf,\r\nMarten, Fox reached the low ebb in 1904-5. All are on the upgrade;\r\npresumably the same applies to the small rodents. Their decacycle\r\nwill be complete in 1914-15, so that 1910-11 should be the years\r\nselected by the next collecting naturalist who would visit the\r\nnorth.\r\n\r\nFor those who will enter before that there is a reasonable prospect\r\nof all these species in fair numbers, except perhaps the Lynx and\r\nthe Caribou. Evidently the former must be near minimum now (1909)\r\nand the latter would be scarce, if it is subject to the rule of the\r\ndecacycle, though it is not at all proven that such is the case.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\nTHE PELICAN TRIP\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe were still held back by the dilatory ways of our Indian friends,\r\nso to lose no time Preble and I determined to investigate a Pelican\r\nrookery.\r\n\r\nMost persons associate the name Pelican with tropic lands and\r\nfish, but ornithologists have long known that in the interior of\r\nthe continent the great white Pelican ranges nearly or quite to\r\nthe Arctic circle. The northmost colony on record was found on an\r\nisland of Great Slave Lake (see Preble, \"N.A. Fauna,\" 27), but this\r\nis a very small one. The northmost large colony, and the one made\r\nfamous by travellers from Alexander Mackenzie downward, is on the\r\ngreat island that splits the Smith Rapids above Fort Smith. Here,\r\nwith a raging flood about their rocky citadel, they are safe from\r\nall spoilers that travel on the earth; only a few birds of the air\r\nneed they fear, and these they have strength to repel.\r\n\r\nOn June 22 we set out to explore this. Preble, Billy, and myself,\r\nwith our canoe on a wagon, drove 6 miles back on the landing trail\r\nand launched the canoe on the still water above Mountain Portage.\r\nPelican Island must be approached exactly right, in the comparatively\r\nslow water above the rocky island, for 20 feet away on each side\r\nis an irresistible current leading into a sure-death cataract. But\r\nBilly was a river pilot and we made the point in safety.\r\n\r\nDrifted like snow through the distant woods were the brooding birds,\r\nbut they arose before we were near and sailed splendidly overhead\r\nin a sweeping, wide-fronted rank. As nearly as I could number them,\r\nthere were 120, but evidently some were elsewhere, as this would\r\nnot allow a pair to each nest.\r\n\r\nWe landed safely and found the nests scattered among the trees and\r\nfallen timbers. One or two mother birds ran off on foot, but took\r\nwing as soon as clear of the woods--none remained.\r\n\r\nThe nests numbered 77, and there was evidence of others long\r\nabandoned. There were 163 eggs, not counting 5 rotten ones, lying\r\noutside; nearly all had 2 eggs in the nest; 3 had 4; 5 had 3; 4 had\r\n1. One or two shells were found in the woods, evidently sucked by\r\nGulls or Ravens.\r\n\r\nAll in the nests were near hatching. One little one had his beak\r\nout and was uttering a hoarse chirping; a dozen blue-bottle flies\r\naround the hole in the shell were laying their eggs in it and\r\non his beak., This led us to examine all the nests that the flies\r\nwere buzzing around, and in each case (six) we found the same state\r\nof affairs, a young one with his beak out and the flies \"blowing\"\r\naround it. All of these were together in one corner, where were a\r\ndozen nests, probably another colony of earlier arrival.\r\n\r\nWe took about a dozen photos of the place (large and small). Then\r\nI set my camera with the long tube to get the old ones, and we went\r\nto lunch at the other end of the island. It was densely wooded and\r\nabout an acre in extent, so we thought we should be forgotten. The\r\nold ones circled high overhead but at last dropped, I thought, back\r\nto the nests. After an hour and a half I returned to the ambush;\r\nnot a Pelican was there. Two Ravens flew high over, but the Pelicans\r\nwere far away, and all as when we went away, leaving the young to\r\nstruggle or get a death-chill as they might. So much for the pious\r\nPelican, the emblem of reckless devotion--a common, dirty little\r\ncock Sparrow would put them all to shame.\r\n\r\nWe brought away only the 5 rotten eggs. About half of the old\r\nPelicans had horns on the bill.\r\n\r\nOn the island we saw a flock of White-winged Crossbills and heard\r\na Song-sparrow. Gulls were seen about. The white spruce cones littered\r\nthe ground and were full of seed, showing that no Redsquirrel was\r\non the island.\r\n\r\nWe left successfully by dashing out exactly as we came, between\r\nthe two dangerous currents, and got well away.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\nTHE THIRD BUFFALO HUNT\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Indians are simply large children, and further, no matter how\r\nreasonable your proposition, they take a long time to consider it\r\nand are subject to all kinds of mental revulsion. So we were lucky\r\nto get away from Fort Smith on July 4 with young Francois Bezkya\r\nas guide. He was a full-blooded Chipewyan Indian, so full that he\r\nhad knowledge of no other tongue, and Billy had to be go-between.\r\n\r\nBezkya, the son of my old patient, came well recommended as a good\r\nman and a moose-hunter. A \"good man\" means a strong, steady worker,\r\nas canoeman or portager. He may be morally the vilest outcast unhung;\r\nthat in no wise modifies the phrase \"he is a good man.\" But more:\r\nthe present was a moosehunter; this is a wonderfully pregnant phrase.\r\nMoose-hunting by fair stalking is the pinnacle of woodcraft. The\r\nCrees alone, as a tribe, are supposed to be masters of the art;\r\nbut many of the Chipewyans are highly successful. One must be a\r\nconsummate trailer, a good shot, have tireless limbs and wind and\r\na complete knowledge of the animal's habits and ways of moving and\r\nthinking. One must watch the wind, without ceasing, for no hunter\r\nhas the slightest chance of success if once the Moose should scent\r\nhim. This last is fundamental, a three-times sacred principle. Not\r\nlong ago one of these Chipewyans went to confessional. Although a\r\nyear had passed since last he got cleaned up, he could think of\r\nnothing to confess. Oh! spotless soul! However, under pressure of\r\nthe priest, he at length remembered a black transgression. The fall\r\nbefore, while hunting, he went to the windward of a thicket that seemed\r\nlikely to hold his Moose, because on the lee, the proper side, the\r\nfooting happened to be very bad, and so he lost his Moose. Yes!\r\nthere was indeed a dark shadow on his recent past.\r\n\r\nA man may be a good hunter, i.e., an all-round trapper and woodman,\r\nbut not a moose-hunter. At Fort Smith are two or three scores of\r\nhunters, and yet I am told there are only three moose-hunters. The\r\nphrase is not usually qualified; he is, or is not, a moose-hunter.\r\nJust as a man is, or is not, an Oxford M.A. The force, then, of\r\nthe phrase appears, and we were content to learn that young Bezkya,\r\nbesides knowing the Buffalo country, was also a good man and a\r\nmoose-hunter.\r\n\r\nWe set out in two canoes, Bezkya and Jarvis in the small one, Billy,\r\nSelig, Preble, and I in the large one, leaving the other police\r\nboys to make Fort Resolution in the H. B. steamer.\r\n\r\nBeing the 4th of July, the usual torrential rains set in. During\r\nthe worst of it we put in at Salt River village. It was amusing\r\nto see the rubbish about the doors of these temporarily deserted\r\ncabins. The midden-heaps of the Cave-men are our principal sources\r\nof information about those by-gone races; the future ethnologist who\r\ndiscovers Salt River midden-heaps will find all the usual skulls,\r\nbones, jaws, teeth, flints, etc., mixed with moccasin beads from\r\nVenice, brass cartridges from New England, broken mirrors from\r\nFrance, Eley cap-boxes from London, copper rings, silver pins,\r\nlead bullets, and pewter spoons, and interpersed with them bits of\r\ntelephone wires and the fragments of gramophone  discs. I wonder\r\nwhat they will make of the last!\r\n\r\nEight miles farther we camped in the rain, reaching the Buffalo\r\nPortage next morning at 10, and had everything over its 5 miles by\r\n7 o'clock at night.\r\n\r\nIt is easily set down on paper, but the uninitiated can scarcely\r\nrealise the fearful toil of portaging. If you are an office man,\r\nsuppose you take an angular box weighing 20 or 30 pounds; if a\r\nfarmer, double the weight, poise it on your shoulders or otherwise,\r\nas you please, and carry it half a mile on a level pavement in\r\ncool, bright weather, and I am mistaken if you do not find yourself\r\nsuffering horribly before the end of a quarter-mile; the last part\r\nof the trip will have been made in something like mortal agony.\r\nRemember, then, that each of these portagers was carrying 150 to\r\n250 pounds of broken stuff, not half a mile, but several miles,\r\nnot on level pavement, but over broken rocks, up banks, through\r\nquagmires and brush--in short, across ground that would be difficult\r\nwalking without any burden, and not in cool, clear weather, but through\r\nstifling swamps with no free hand to ease the myriad punctures of\r\nhis body, face, and limbs whenever unsufficiently protected from\r\nthe stingers that roam in clouds. It is the hardest work I ever\r\nsaw performed by human beings; the burdens are heavier than some\r\nmen will allow their horses to carry.\r\n\r\nYet all this frightful labour was cheerfully gone through by white\r\nmen, half-breeds, and Indians alike. They accept it as a part of\r\ntheir daily routine. This fact alone is enough to guarantee the\r\nindustrial future of the red-man when the hunter life is no longer\r\npossible.\r\n\r\nNext day we embarked on the Little Buffalo River, beginning what\r\nshould have been and would have been a trip of memorable joys but\r\nfor the awful, awful, awful--see Chapter IX.\r\n\r\nThe Little Buffalo is the most beautiful river in the whole world\r\nexcept, perhaps, its affluent, the Nyarling.\r\n\r\nThis statement sounds like the exaggeration of mere impulsive\r\nutterance. Perhaps it is; but I am writing now after thinking the\r\nmatter over for two and a half years, during, which time I have\r\nseen a thousand others, including the upper Thames, the Afton, the\r\nSeine, the Arno, the Tiber, the Iser, the Spree, and the Rhine.\r\n\r\nA hundred miles long is this uncharted stream; fifty feet its breadth\r\nof limpid tide; eight feet deep, crystal clear, calm, slow, and\r\ndeep to the margin. A steamer could ply on its placid, unobstructed\r\nflood, a child could navigate it anywhere. The heavenly beauty of\r\nthe shores, with virgin forest of fresh, green spruces towering a\r\nhundred feet on every side, or varied in open places with long rows\r\nand thick-set hedges of the gorgeous, wild, red, Athabaska rose,\r\nmade a stream that most canoemen,  woodmen,  and naturalists would\r\nthink without a fault or flaw, and with every river beauty in its\r\nhighest possible degree. Not trees and flood alone had strenuous\r\npower to win our souls; at every point and bank, in every bend,\r\nwere living creatures of the north, Beaver and Bear, not often seen\r\nbut abundant; Moose tracks showed from time to time and birds were\r\nhere in thousands. Rare winter birds, as we had long been taught\r\nto think them in our southern homes; here we found them in their\r\nnative land and heard not a few sweet melodies, of which in faraway\r\nOntario, New Jersey, and Maryland we had been favoured only with\r\npromising scraps when wintry clouds were broken by the sun. Nor were\r\nthe old familiar ones away--Flicker, Sapsucker, Hairy Woodpecker,\r\nKingfisher, Least Flycatcher, Alder Flycatcher, Robin, Crow, and\r\nHorned Owl were here to mingle their noises with the stranger melodies\r\nand calls of Lincoln Sparrow, Fox Sparrow, Olive-sided Flycatcher,\r\nSnipe, Rusty Blackbird, and Bohemian Waxwing.\r\n\r\nNever elsewhere have I seen Horned Owls so plentiful. I did not know\r\nthat there were so many Bear and Beaver left; I never was so much\r\nimpressed by the inspiring raucous clamour of the Cranes, the\r\ncontinual spatter of Ducks, the cries of Gulls and Yellowlegs.\r\nHour after hour we paddled down that stately river adding our 3\r\n1/2 miles to its 1 mile speed; each turn brought to view some new\r\nand lovelier aspect of bird and forest life. I never knew a land\r\nof balmier air; I never felt the piney breeze more sweet; nowhere\r\nbut in the higher mountains is there such a tonic sense abroad;\r\nthe bright woods and river reaches were eloquent of a clime whose\r\nmaladies are mostly foreign-born. But alas! I had to view it all\r\nswaddled, body, hands, and head, like a bee-man handling his swarms.\r\nSongs were muffled, scenes were dimmed by the thick, protecting,\r\nsuffocating veil without which men can scarcely live.\r\n\r\nTen billion dollars would be all too small reward, a trifle totally\r\ninadequate to compensate, mere nominal recognition of the man who\r\nshall invent and realise a scheme to save this earthly paradise\r\nfrom this its damning pest and malediction.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII\r\n\r\nDOWN TO FUNDAMENTALS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAt 8.30 A. M., 10 miles from the portage, we came to the Clew-ee,\r\nor White Fish River; at 6.30 P. M. made the Sass Tessi, or Bear\r\nRiver, and here camped, having covered fully 40 miles.\r\n\r\nNow for the first time we were all together, with leisure to\r\nquestion our guide and plan in detail. But all our mirth and hopes\r\nwere rudely checked by Corporal Selig, who had entire charge of\r\nthe commissary, announcing that there were only two days' rations\r\nleft.\r\n\r\nIn the dead calm that followed this bomb-shell we all did some\r\nthinking; then a rapid fire of questions demonstrated the danger\r\nof having a guide who does not speak our language.\r\n\r\nIt seems that when asked how many days' rations we should take on\r\nthis Buffalo hunt he got the idea how many days to the Buffalo. He\r\nsaid five, meaning five days each way and as much time as we wished\r\nthere. We were still two days from our goal. Now what should we\r\ndo? Scurry back to the fort or go ahead and trust to luck? Every\r\nman present voted \"go ahead on half rations.\"\r\n\r\nWe had good, healthy appetites; half rations was veritable hardship;\r\nbut our hollow insides made hearty laughing. Preble disappeared\r\nas soon  as we camped, and now at the right time he returned and\r\nsilently threw at the cook's feet a big 6-pound Pike. It was just\r\nright, exactly as it happens in the most satisfactory books and plays.\r\nIt seems that he always carried a spoon-hook, and went at once to\r\nwhat he rightly judged the best place, a pool at the junction of\r\nthe two rivers. The first time he threw he captured the big fellow.\r\nLater he captured three smaller ones in the same place, but evidently\r\nthere were no more.\r\n\r\nThat night we had a glorious feast; every one had as much as he\r\ncould eat, chiefly fish. Next morning we went on 4 1/2 miles farther,\r\nthen came to the mouth of the Nyarling Tessi, or Underground River,\r\nthat joins the Buffalo from the west. This was our stream; this\r\nwas the highway to the Buffalo country. It was a miniature of the\r\nriver we were leaving, but a little quicker in current. In about\r\n2 miles we came to a rapid, but were able to paddle up. About 6\r\nmiles farther was an immense and ancient log-jamb that filled the\r\nstream from bank to bank for 190 yards. What will be the ultimate\r\nhistory of this jamb? It is added to each year, the floods have no\r\npower to move it, logs in water practically never rot, there is no\r\nprospect of it being removed by natural agencies. I suspect that\r\nat its head the river comes out of a succession of such things,\r\nwhence its name Underground River.,\r\n\r\nAround this jamb is an easy portage. We were far now from the haunts\r\nof any but Indians on the winter hunt, so were surprised to see on\r\nthis portage trail the deep imprints of a white man's boot. These\r\nwere made apparently within a week, by whom I never learned. On the\r\nbank not far away we saw a Lynx pursued overhead by two scolding\r\nRedsquirrels.\r\n\r\nLunch consisted of what remained of the Pike, but that afternoon\r\nBezkya saw two Brown Cranes on a meadow, and manoeuvring till they\r\nwere in line killed both with one shot of his rifle at over 100\r\nyards, the best shot I ever knew an Indian to make. Still, two\r\nCranes totalling 16 pounds gross is not enough meat to last five\r\nmen a week, so we turned to our Moosehunter.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, he could get a Moose.\" He went on in the small canoe with\r\nBilly; we were to follow, and if we passed his canoe leave a note.\r\nSeven miles above the log-jamb, the river forked south and west;\r\nhere a note from the guide sent us up the South Fork; later we\r\npassed his canoe on the bank and knew that he had landed and was\r\nsurely on his way \"to market.\" What a comfortable feeling it was to\r\nremember that Bezkya was a moose-hunter! We left word and travelled\r\ntill 7, having come 11 miles up from the river's mouth. Our supper\r\nthat night was Crane, a little piece of bread each, some soup, and\r\nsome tea.\r\n\r\nAt 10 the hunters came back empty-handed. Yes, they found a fresh\r\nMoose track, but the creature was so pestered by clouds of --------\r\nthat he travelled continually as fast as he could against the wind.\r\nThey followed all day but could not overtake him. They saw a Beaver\r\nbut failed to get it. No other game was found.\r\n\r\nThings were getting serious now, since all our food consisted of\r\n1 Crane, 1 tin of brawn, 1 pound of bread, 2 pounds of pork, with\r\nsome tea, coffee, and sugar, not more than one square meal for\r\nthe crowd, and we were 5 men far from supplies, unless our hunting\r\nproved successful, and going farther every day.\r\n\r\nNext morning (July 9) each man had coffee, one lady's finger\r\nof bread, and a single small slice of bacon. Hitherto from choice\r\nI had not eaten bacon in this country, although it was a regular\r\nstaple served at each meal. But now, with proper human perversity,\r\nI developed an extraordinary appetite for bacon. It seemed quite\r\nthe most delicious gift of God to man. Given bacon, and I was ready\r\nto forgo all other foods. Nevertheless, we had divided the last of\r\nit. I cut my slice in two, revelled in half, then secretly wrapped\r\nthe other piece in paper and hid it in the watch-pocket of my\r\nvest, thinking \"the time is in sight when the whole crowd will be\r\nthankful to have that scrap of bacon among them.\" (As a matter of\r\nfact, they never got it, for five days later we found a starving\r\ndog and he was so utterly miserable that he conjured that scrap\r\nfrom the pocket next my heart.)\r\n\r\nWe were face to face with something like starvation now; the game\r\nseemed to shun us and our store of victuals was done. Yet no one\r\ntalked of giving up or going back. We set out to reach the Buffalo\r\ncountry, and reach it we would.\r\n\r\nThat morning we got 7 little Teal, so our lunch was sure, but\r\nstraight Teal without accompaniments is not very satisfying; we\r\nall went very hungry. And with one mind we all thought and talked\r\nabout the good dinners or specially fine food we once had had.\r\nSelig's dream of bliss was a porterhouse steak with a glass of foaming\r\nbeer; Jarvis thought champagne and roast turkey spelt heaven just\r\nthen; I thought of my home breakfasts and the Beaux-Arts at New\r\nYork; but Billy said he would he perfectly happy if he could have\r\none whole bannock all to himself. Preble said nothing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX\r\n\r\nWHITE MAN AND RED. MEAT, BUT NOTHING MORE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThere was plenty of hollow hilarity but no word of turning back.\r\nBut hold! yes, there was. There was one visage that darkened more\r\neach day, and finally the gloomy thoughts broke forth in words\r\nfrom the lips of--our Indian guide. His recent sullen silence was\r\nnow changed to open and rebellious upbraiding.\r\n\r\nHe didn't come here to starve. He could do that at home. He was\r\ninduced to come by a promise of plenty of flour. \"All of which was\r\nperfectly true. But,\" he went on, \"We were still 11 days from the\r\nBuffalo and we were near the head of navigation; it was a case\r\nof tramp through the swamp with our beds and guns, living on the\r\ncountry as we went, and if we didn't have luck the Coyotes and\r\nRavens would.\"\r\n\r\nBefore we had time to discuss this prospect, a deciding step was\r\nannounced, by Jarvis, He was under positive orders to catch the\r\nsteamer Wrigley at Fort Resolution on the evening of July 10. It was\r\nnow mid-day of July 9, and only by leaving at once and travelling\r\nall night could he cover the intervening 60 miles.\r\n\r\nSo then and there we divided the remnants of food evenly, for\r\n\"Bezkya was a moose-hunter.\"\r\n\r\nThen Major Jarvis and Corporal Selig boarded the smaller canoe.\r\nWe shook hands warmly, and I at least had a lump in my throat;\r\nthey were such good fellows in camp, and to part this way when\r\nwe especially felt bound to stick together, going each of us on a\r\njourney of privation and peril, seemed especially hard; and we were\r\nso hungry. But we were living our lives. They rounded the bend, we\r\nwaved goodbye, and I have never seen them since.\r\n\r\nHitherto I was a guest; now I was in sole command, and called a\r\ncouncil of war. Billy was stanch and ready to go anywhere at any\r\ncost. So was Preble. Bezkya was sulky and rebellious. Physically,\r\nI had been at the point of a total breakdown when I left home; the\r\noutdoor life had been slowly restoring me, but the last few days\r\nhad weakened me sadly and I was not fit for a long expedition on\r\nfoot. But of one thing I was sure, we must halt till we got food.\r\nA high wind was blowing and promised some respite to the Moose from\r\nthe little enemy that sings except when he stings, so I invited\r\nBezkya to gird up his loins and make another try for Moose.\r\n\r\nNothing loath, he set off with Billy. I marked them well as they\r\nwent, one lithe, sinewy, active, animal-eyed; the other solid and\r\nsturdy, following doggedly, keeping up by sheer blundering strength.\r\nI could not but admire them, each in his kind.\r\n\r\nTwo hours later I heard two shots, and toward evening the boys came\r\nback slowly, tired but happy, burdened with the meat, for Bezkya\r\nwas a moosehunter.\r\n\r\nMany shekels and gladly would I have given to have been on that\r\nmoose hunt. Had I seen it I could have told it. These men, that\r\ndo it so well, never can tell it. Yet in the days that followed\r\nI picked up a few significant phrases that gave glimpses of its\r\naction.\r\n\r\nThrough the crooked land of endless swamp this son of the woods\r\nhad set out \"straightaway west.\" A big track appeared crossing a\r\npool, seeming fresh. \"No! he go by yesterday; water in track not\r\nmuddy.\" Another track was found. \"Yes, pretty good; see bite alder.\r\nAlder turn red in two hours; only half red.\" Follow long. \"Look\r\nout, Billy; no go there; wrong wind. Yes, he pass one hour; see\r\nbit willow still white. Stop; he pass half-hour; see grass still\r\nbend. He lie down soon. How know? Oh, me know. Stand here, Billy.\r\nHe sleep in thick willow there.\"\r\n\r\nThen the slow crawl in absolute stillness, the long wait, the\r\nbetrayal of the huge beast by the ear that wagged furiously to\r\nshake off the winged bloodsuckers. The shot, the rush, the bloody\r\ntrail, the pause in the opening to sense the foe, the shots from\r\nboth hunters, and the death.\r\n\r\nNext day we set out in the canoe for the Moose, which lay conveniently\r\non the river bank. After pushing through the alders and poling up\r\nthe dwindling stream for a couple of hours we reached the place\r\ntwo miles up, by the stream. It was a big bull with no bell, horns\r\nonly two-thirds grown but 46 inches across, the tips soft and\r\nspringy; one could stick a knife through them anywhere outside of\r\nthe basal half.\r\n\r\nBezkya says they are good to eat in this stage; but we had about\r\n700 pounds of good meat so did not try. The velvet on the horns is\r\nmarked by a series of concentric curved lines of white hair, across\r\nthe lines of growth; these, I take it, correspond with times of\r\ncheck by chill or hardship.\r\n\r\nWe loaded our canoe with meat and pushed on toward the Buffalo\r\ncountry for two miles more up the river. Navigation now became very\r\ndifficult on account of alders in the stream. Bezkya says that only\r\na few hundred yards farther and the river comes from underground.\r\nThis did not prove quite correct, for I went half a mile farther\r\nby land and found no change.\r\n\r\nHere, however, we did find some Buffalo tracks; one went through\r\nour camp, and farther on were many, but all dated from the spring\r\nand were evidently six weeks old.\r\n\r\nThere were no recent tracks, which was discouraging, and the air\r\nof gloom over our camp grew heavier. The weather had been bad ever\r\nsince we left Fort Smith, cloudy or showery. This morning for the\r\nfirst time the day dawned with a clear sky, but by noon it was\r\ncloudy and soon again raining. Our diet consisted of nothing but\r\nMoose meat and tea; we had neither sugar nor salt, and the craving\r\nfor farinaceous food was strong and growing. We were what the.\r\nnatives call \"flour hungry\"; our three-times-a-day prospect of Moose,\r\nMoose, Moose was becoming loathsome. Bezkya was openly rebellious\r\nonce more, and even my two trusties were very, very glum. Still,\r\nthe thought of giving up was horrible, so I made a proposition:\r\n\"Bezkya, you go out scouting on, foot and see if you can locate a\r\nband. I'll give you five dollars extra if you show me one Buffalo.\"\r\n\r\nAt length he agreed to go provided I would set out for Fort\r\nResolution at once unless he found Buffalo near. This was leaving\r\nit all in his hands. While I was considering, Preble said: \"I tell\r\nyou this delay is playing the mischief with our Barren-Ground trip;\r\nwe should have started for the north ten days ago,\" which was in\r\ntruth enough to settle the matter.\r\n\r\nI knew perfectly well beforehand what Bezkya's report would be.\r\n\r\nAt 6.30 he returned to say he found nothing but old tracks. There\r\nwere no Buffalo nearer than two days' travel on foot, and he should\r\nlike to return at once to Fort Resolution.\r\n\r\nThere was no further ground for debate; every one and everything\r\nnow was against me. Again I had to swallow the nauseating draught\r\nof defeat and retreat.\r\n\r\n\"We start northward first thing in the morning,\" I said briefly,\r\nand our third Buffalo hunt was over.\r\n\r\nThese, then, were the results so far as Buffalo were concerned:\r\nOld tracks as far down as last camp, plenty of old tracks here and\r\nwestward, but the Buffalo, as before on so many occasions, were\r\ntwo days' travel to the westward.\r\n\r\nDuring all this time I had lost no good opportunity of impressing\r\non the men the sinfulness of leaving a camp-fire burning and of\r\ntaking life unnecessarily; and now, I learned of fruit from this\r\nseeding. That night Bezkya was in a better humour, for obvious\r\nreasons; he talked freely and told me how that day he came on a\r\nlarge Blackbear which at once took to a tree. The Indian had his\r\nrifle, but thought, \"I can kill him, yet I can't stop to skin him\r\nor use his meat,\" so left him in peace.\r\n\r\nThis is really a remarkable incident, almost unique. I am glad\r\nto believe that I had something to do with causing such unusual\r\nforbearance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX\r\n\r\nON THE NYARLING\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAll night it rained; in the morning it was dull, foggy, and showery.\r\nEverything was very depressing, especially in view of this second\r\ndefeat. The steady diet of Moose and tea was debilitating; my legs\r\ntrembled under me. I fear I should be a poor one to stand starvation,\r\nif so slight a brunt should play such havoc with my strength.\r\n\r\nWe set out early to retrace the course of the Nyarling, which in\r\nspite of associated annoyances and disappointments will ever shine\r\nforth in my memory as the \"Beautiful River.\"\r\n\r\nIt is hard, indeed, for words to do it justice. The charm of a\r\nstream is always within three feet of the surface and ten feet of\r\nthe bank. The broad Slave, then, by its size wins in majesty but\r\nmust lose most all its charm; the Buffalo, being fifty feet wide,\r\nhas some waste water; but the Nyarling, half the size, has its\r\nbirthright compounded and intensified in manifold degree. The water\r\nis clear, two or three feet deep at the edge of the grassy banks,\r\nseven to ten feet in mid-channel, without bars or obstructions\r\nexcept the two log-jambs noted, and these might easily be removed.\r\nThe current is about one mile and a half an hour, so that canoes\r\ncan readily pass up or down; the scenery varies continually and is\r\nalways beautiful. Everything that I have said of the Little Buffalo\r\napplies to the Nyarling with fourfold force, because of its more\r\nvaried scenery and greater range of bird and other life. Sometimes,\r\nlike the larger stream, it presents a long, straight vista of a\r\nquarter-mile through a solemn aisle in the forest of mighty spruce\r\ntrees that tower a hundred feet in height, all black with gloom,\r\ngreen with health, and gray with moss.\r\n\r\nSometimes its channel winds in and out of open grassy meadows that\r\nare dotted with clumps of rounded trees, as in an English park.\r\nNow it narrows to a deep and sinuous bed, through alders so rank\r\nand reaching that they meet overhead and form a shade of golden\r\ngreen; and again it widens out into reedy lakes, the summer home\r\nof countless Ducks, Geese, Tattlers Terns, Peetweets, Gulls, Rails,\r\nBlackbirds, and half a hundred of the lesser tribes. Sometimes the\r\nforeground is rounded masses of kinnikinnik in snowy flower, or\r\nagain a far-strung growth of the needle bloom, richest and reddest\r\nof its tribe--the Athabaska rose. At times it is skirted by tall\r\npoplar woods where the claw-marks on the trunks are witness of the\r\nmany Blackbears, or some tamarack swamp showing signs and proofs\r\nthat hereabouts a family of Moose had fed to-day, or by a broad\r\nand broken trail that told of a Buffalo band passing weeks ago.\r\nAnd while we gazed at scribbled records, blots, and marks, the loud\r\n\"slap plong\" of a Beaver showed from time to time that the thrifty\r\nones had dived at our approach.\r\n\r\nOn the way up Jarvis had gone first in the small canoe; he saw 2\r\nBears, 3 Beaver, and 1 Lynx; I saw nothing but birds. On the way\r\ndown, being alone, the luck came my way.\r\n\r\nAt the first camp, after he left, we heard a loud \"plong\" in the\r\nwater near the boat. Bezkya glided to the spot; I followed--here\r\nwas a large Beaver swimming. The Indian fired, the Beaver plunged,\r\nand we saw nothing more of it. He told Billy, who told me, that it\r\nwas dead, because it did not slap with its tail as it went down.\r\nNext night another splashed by our boat.\r\n\r\nThis morning as we paddled we saw a little stream, very muddy,\r\ntrickling into the river. Bezkya said, \"Beaver at work on his dam\r\nthere.\" Now that we were really heading for flour, our Indian showed\r\nup well. He was a strong paddler, silent but apparently cheerful,\r\nready at all times to work. As a hunter and guide he was of course\r\nfirst class. About 10.30 we came on a large Beaver sunning himself\r\non a perch built of mud just above the water. He looked like a\r\nhuge chestnut Muskrat. He plunged at once but came up again yards\r\nfarther down, took another look and dived, to be seen no more.\r\n\r\nAt noon we reached our old camp, the last where all had been\r\ntogether. Here we put up a monument on a tree, and were mortified\r\nto think we had not done so at our farthest camp.\r\n\r\nThere were numbers of Yellowlegs breeding here; we were surprised\r\nto see them resting on trees or flying from one branch to another.\r\n\r\nA Great Gray-owl sitting on a stump was a conspicuous feature of\r\nour landscape view; his white choker shone like a parson's.\r\n\r\nEarly in the morning we saw a Kingbird. This was our northernmost\r\nrecord for the species.\r\n\r\nWe pressed on all day, stopping only for our usual supper of Moose\r\nand tea, and about 7 the boys were ready to go on again. They\r\npaddled till dark at 10. Camped in the rain, but every one was\r\nwell pleased, for we had made 40 miles that day and were that much\r\nnearer to flour.\r\n\r\nThis journey had brought us down the Nyarling and 15 miles down\r\nthe Buffalo.\r\n\r\nIt rained all night; next morning the sun came out once or twice but\r\ngave it up, and clouds with rain sprinklings kept on. We had struck\r\na long spell of wet; it was very trying, and fatal to photographic\r\nwork.\r\n\r\nAfter a delicious, appetising, and inspiring breakfast of straight\r\nMoose, without even salt, and raw tea, we pushed on along the line\r\nof least resistance, i.e., toward flour.\r\n\r\nA flock of half a dozen Bohemian Waxwings were seen catching flies\r\namong the tall spruce tops; probably all were males enjoying a stag\r\nparty while their wives were home tending eggs or young.\r\n\r\nBilly shot a female Bufflehead Duck; she was so small-only 8 inches\r\nin slack girth--that she could easily have entered an ordinary\r\nWoodpecker hole. So that it is likely the species nest in the abandoned\r\nholes of the Flicker. A Redtailed Hawk had its nest on a leaning\r\nspruce above the water. It was a most striking and picturesque\r\nobject; doubtless the owner was very well pleased with it, but a\r\npair of Robins militant attacked him whenever he tried to go near\r\nit.\r\n\r\nA Beaver appeared swimming ahead; Bezkya seized his rifle and\r\nremoved the top of its head, thereby spoiling a splendid skull but\r\nsecuring a pelt and a new kind of meat. Although I was now paying\r\nhis wages the Beaver did not belong to me. According to the custom\r\nof the country it belonged to Bezkya. He owed me nothing but service\r\nas a guide. Next meal we had Beaver tail roasted and boiled; it\r\nwas very delicious, but rather rich and heavy.\r\n\r\nAt 3.45 we reached Great Slave Lake, but found the sea so high\r\nthat it would have been very dangerous to attempt crossing to Fort\r\nResolution, faintly to be seen a dozen miles away.\r\n\r\nWe waited till 7, then ventured forth; it was only 11 miles across\r\nand we could send that canoe at 5 1/2 miles an hour, but the wind\r\nand waves against us were so strong that it took 3 1/2 hours to\r\nmake the passage. At 10.30 we landed at Resolution and pitched our\r\ntent among 30 teepees with 200 huge dogs that barked, scratched,\r\nhowled, yelled, and fought around, in, and over the tent-ropes\r\nall night long. Oh, how different from the tranquil woods of the\r\nNyarling!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI\r\n\r\nFORT RESOLUTION AND ITS FOLK\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEarly next morning Preble called on his old acquaintance, Chief\r\nTrader C. Harding, in charge of the post. Whenever we have gone to\r\nH. B. Co. officials to do business with them, as officers of the\r\ncompany, we have found them the keenest of the keen; but whenever\r\nit is their personal affair, they are hospitality out-hospitalled.\r\nThey give without stint; they lavish their kindness on the stranger\r\nfrom the big world. In a few minutes Preble hastened back to say\r\nthat we were to go to breakfast at once.\r\n\r\nThat breakfast, presided over by a charming woman and a genial,\r\ngenerous man, was one that will not be forgotten while I live.\r\nThink of it, after the hard scrabble on the Nyarling! We had real\r\nporridge and cream, coffee with veritable sugar and milk, and\r\nauthentic butter, light rolls made of actual flour, unquestionable\r\nbacon and potatoes, with jam and toast--the really, truly things--and\r\nwe had as much as we could eat! We behaved rather badly--intemperately,\r\nI fear--we stopped only when forced to do it, and yet both of us\r\ncame away with appetites.\r\n\r\nIt was clear that I must get some larger craft than my canoe to\r\ncross the lake from Fort Resolution and take the 1,300 pounds of\r\nprovisions that had come on the steamer. Harding kindly offered the\r\nloan of a York boat, and with the help chiefly of Charlie McLeod\r\nthe white man, who is interpreter at the fort, I secured a crew to\r\nman it. But oh, what worry and annoyance it was! These Great Slave\r\nLake Indians are like a lot of spoiled and petulant children,\r\nwith the added weakness of adult criminals; they are inconsistent,\r\nshiftless, and tricky. Pike, Whitney, Buffalo Jones, and others\r\nunited many years ago in denouncing them as the most worthless and\r\ncontemptible of the human race, and since then they have considerably\r\ndeteriorated. There are exceptions, however, as will be seen by\r\nthe record.\r\n\r\nOne difficulty was that it became known that on the Buffalo expedition\r\nBezkya had received three dollars a day, which is government\r\nemergency pay. I had agreed to pay the regular maximum, two dollars\r\na day with presents and keep. All came and demanded three dollars.\r\nI told them they could go at once in search of the hottest place\r\never pictured by a diseased and perfervid human imagination.\r\n\r\nIf they went there they decided not to stay, because in an hour\r\nthey were back offering to compromise. I said I could run back to\r\nFort Smith (it sounds like nothing) and get all the men I needed\r\nat one dollar and a half. (I should mortally have hated to try.)\r\nOne by one the crew resumed. Then another bombshell. I had offended\r\nChief Snuff by not calling and consulting with him; he now gave\r\nit out that I was here to take out live Musk-ox, which meant that\r\nall the rest would follow to seek their lost relatives. Again my\r\ncrew resigned. I went to see Snuff. Every man has his price. Snuff's\r\nprice was half a pound of tea; and the crew came back, bringing,\r\nhowever, several new modifications in our contract.\r\n\r\nTaking no account of several individuals that joined a number of\r\ntimes but finally resigned, the following, after they had received\r\npresents, provisions, and advance pay, were the crew secured to\r\nman the York boat on the \"3 or 4\" days' run to Pike's Portage and\r\nthen carry my goods to the first lake.\r\n\r\nWeeso. The Jesuits called him Louison d'Noire, but it has been\r\ncorrupted into a simpler form. \"Weeso\" they call it, \"Weeso\" they\r\nwrite it, and for \"Weeso\" you must ask, or you will not find him.\r\nSo I write it as I do \"Sousi\" and \"Yum,\" with the true local colour.\r\n\r\nHe was a nice, kind, simple old rabbit, not much use and not\r\nover-strong, but he did his best, never murmuring, and in all the\r\nmutinies and rebellions that followed he remained staunch, saying\r\nsimply, \"I gave my word I would go, and I will go.\" He would make\r\na safe guide for the next party headed for Aylmer Lake. He alone\r\ndid not ask rations for his wife during his absence; he said, \"It\r\ndidn't matter about her, as they had been married for a long time\r\nnow.\" He asked as presents a pair of my spectacles, as his eyes\r\nwere failing, and a marble axe. The latter I sent him later, but\r\nhe could not understand why glasses that helped me should not help\r\nhim. He acted as pilot and guide, knowing next to nothing about\r\neither.\r\n\r\nFrancois d'Noire, son of Weeso, a quiet, steady, inoffensive chap,\r\nbut not strong; nevertheless, having been there once with us, he\r\nis now a competent guide to take any other party as far as Pike's\r\nPortage.\r\n\r\nC., a sulky brute and a mischief-maker. He joined and resigned\r\na dozen times that day, coming back on each occasion with a new\r\ndemand.\r\n\r\nS., grandson of the chief, a sulky good-for-nothing; would not have\r\nhim again at any price; besides the usual wages, tobacco, food,\r\netc., he demanded extra to support his wife during his absence.\r\nThe wife, I found, was a myth.\r\n\r\nT., a sulky good-for-nothing.\r\n\r\nBeaulieu, an alleged grandson of his grandfather. A perpetual\r\nbreeder of trouble; never did a decent day's work the whole trip.\r\nInsolent, mutinous, and overbearing, till I went for him with intent\r\nto do bodily mischief; then he became extremely obsequious. Like\r\nthe rest of the foregoing, he resigned and resumed at irregular\r\nintervals.\r\n\r\nYum (William), Freesay; the best of the lot; a bright, cheerful,\r\nintelligent, strong Indian, boy. He and my old standby, Billy\r\nLoutit, did virtually all the handling of that big boat. Any one\r\ntravelling in that country should secure Yum if they can. He was\r\nworth all the others put together.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII\r\n\r\nTHE CHIPEWYANS, THEIR SPEECH AND WRITING\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSweeping generalisations are always misleading, therefore I offer\r\nsome now, and later will correct them by specific instances.\r\n\r\nThese Chipewyans are dirty, shiftless, improvident, and absolutely\r\nhonest. Of the last we saw daily instances in crossing the country.\r\nValuables hung in trees, protected only from weather, birds, and\r\nbeasts, but never a suggestion that they needed protection from\r\nmankind. They are kind and hospitable among themselves, but grasping\r\nin their dealings with white men, as already set forth. While they\r\nare shiftless and lazy, they also undertake the frightful toil of\r\nhunting and portaging. Although improvident, they have learned to\r\ndry a stock of meat and put up a scaffold of white fish for winter\r\nuse. As a tribe they are mild and inoffensive, although they are\r\nthe original stock from which the Apaches broke away some hundreds\r\nof years ago before settling in the south.\r\n\r\nThey have suffered greatly from diseases imported by white men,\r\nbut not from whiskey. The Hudson's Bay Company has always refused\r\nto supply liquor to the natives. What little of the evil traffic\r\nthere has been was the work of free-traders. But the Royal Mounted\r\nPolice have most rigorously and effectually suppressed this.\r\nNevertheless, Chief Trader Anderson tells me that the Mackenzie\r\nValley tribes have fallen to less than half their numbers during\r\nthe last century.\r\n\r\nIt is about ten, years since they made the treaty that surrendered\r\ntheir lands to the government. They have no reserves, but are free\r\nto hunt as their fathers did.\r\n\r\nI found several of the older men lamenting the degeneracy of\r\ntheir people. \"Our fathers were hunters and our mothers made good\r\nmoccasins, but the young men are lazy loafers around the trading\r\nposts, and the women get money in bad ways to buy what they should\r\nmake with their hands.\"\r\n\r\nThe Chipewyan dialects are peculiarly rasping, clicking, and\r\nguttural, especially when compared with Cree.\r\n\r\nEvery man and woman and most of the children among them smoke.\r\nThey habitually appear with a pipe in their mouth and speak without\r\nremoving it, so that the words gurgle out on each side of the pipe\r\nwhile a thin stream goes sizzling through the stem. This additional\r\nvariant makes it hopeless to suggest on paper any approach to their\r\npeculiar speech.\r\n\r\nThe Jesuits tell me that it was more clicked and guttural fifty\r\nyears ago, but that they are successfully weeding out many of the\r\nmore unpleasant catarrhal sounds.\r\n\r\nIn noting down the names of animals, I was struck by the fact that\r\nthe more familiar the animal the shorter its name. Thus the Beaver,\r\nMuskrat, Rabbit, and Marten, on which they live, are respectively\r\nTsa, Dthen, Ka, and Tha. The less familiar (in a daily sense) Red\r\nFox and Weasel are Nak-ee-they, Noon-dee-a, Tel-ky-lay; and the\r\ncomparatively scarce Musk-ox and little Weasel, At-huh-le-jer-ray\r\nand Tel-ky-lay-azzy. All of which is clear and logical, for the\r\nname originally is a description, but the softer parts and sharp\r\nangles are worn down by the attrition of use--the more use they\r\nhave for a word the shorter it is bound to get. In this connection\r\nit is significant that \"to-day\" is To-ho-chin-nay, and \"to-morrow\"\r\nKom-pay.\r\n\r\nThe Chipewyan teepee is very distinctive; fifty years ago all were\r\nof caribou leather, now most are of cotton; not for lack of caribou,\r\nbut because the cotton does not need continual watching to save it\r\nfrom the dogs. Of the fifty teepees at Fort Chipewyan, one or two\r\nonly were of caribou but many had caribou-skin tops, as these are\r\nless likely to bum than those of cotton.\r\n\r\nThe way they manage the smoke is very clever; instead of the two\r\nfixed flaps, as among the Plains River Indians, these have a separate\r\nhood which is easily set on any side (see III). Chief Squirrel lives\r\nin a lodge that is an admirable combination of the white men's tent\r\nwith its weather-proof roof and the Indian teepee with its cosy\r\nfire. (See cut, p. 149.)\r\n\r\nNot one of these lodges that I saw, here or elsewhere, had the\r\nslightest suggestion of decoration.\r\n\r\nFor people who spend their whole life on or near the water these are\r\nthe worst boatmen I ever saw. The narrow, thick paddle they make,\r\ncompared with the broad, thin Iroquois paddle, exactly expressed\r\nthe difference between the two as canoemen. The Chipewyan's mode of\r\nusing it is to sit near the middle and make 2 or perhaps 3 strokes\r\non one side, then change to the other side for the same, and so\r\non. The line made by the canoes is an endless zigzag. The idea of\r\npaddling on one side so dexterously that the canoe goes straight\r\nis yet on an evolutionary pinnacle beyond their present horizon.\r\n\r\nIn rowing, their way is to stand up, reach forward with the 30-pound\r\n16 1/2-foot oar, throw all the weight on it, falling backward into\r\nthe seat. After half an hour of this exhausting work they must rest\r\n15 to 20 minutes. The long, steady, strong pull is unknown to them\r\nin every sense.\r\n\r\nTheir ideas of sailing a boat are childish. Tacking is like washing,\r\nmerely a dim possibility of their very distant future. It's a\r\nsailing wind if behind; otherwise it's a case of furl and row.\r\n\r\nBy an ancient, unwritten law the whole country is roughly divided\r\namong the hunters. Each has his own recognised hunting ground,\r\nusually a given river valley, that is his exclusive and hereditary\r\nproperty; another hunter may follow a wounded animal into it, but\r\nnot begin a hunt there or set a trap upon it.\r\n\r\nMost of their time is spent at the village, but the hunting ground\r\nis visited at proper seasons.\r\n\r\nFifty years ago they commonly went half naked. How they stood the\r\ninsects I do not know, and when asked they merely grinned significantly;\r\nprobably they doped themselves with grease.\r\n\r\nThis religious training has had one bad effect. Inspired with horror\r\nof being \"naked\" savages, they do not run any sinful risks, even\r\nto take a bath. In all the six months I was among them I never saw\r\nan Indian's bare arms, much less his legs. One day after the fly\r\nseason was over I took advantage of the lovely weather and water\r\nto strip off and jump into a lake by our camp;  my Indians modestly\r\nturned their backs until I had finished.\r\n\r\nIf this mock modesty worked for morality one might well accept it,\r\nbut the old folks say that it operates quite the other way. It has\r\nat all events put an end to any possibility of them taking a bath.\r\n\r\nMaybe as a consequence, but of this I am not sure, none of these\r\nIndians swim. A large canoe-load upset in crossing Great Slave Lake\r\na month after we arrived and all were drowned.\r\n\r\nLike most men who lead physical lives, and like all meat-eating\r\nsavages, these are possessed of a natural proneness toward strong\r\ndrink.\r\n\r\nAn interesting two-edged boomerang illustration of this was given\r\nby an unscrupulous whiskey trader. While travelling across country\r\nhe ran short of provisions but fortunately came to a Chipewyan\r\nlodge. At first its owner had no meat to spare, but when he found\r\nthat the visitor had a flask of whiskey he offered for it a large\r\npiece of Moose meat; when this was refused he doubled the amount,\r\nand after another refusal added some valuable furs and more meat\r\ntill one hundred dollars worth was piled up.\r\n\r\nAgain the answer was \"no.\"\r\n\r\nThen did that Indian offer the lodge and everything he had in it,\r\nincluding his wife. But the trader was obdurate.\r\n\r\n\"Why didn't you take it,\" said the friend whom he told of the\r\naffair; \"the stuff would have netted five hundred dollars, and all\r\nfor one flask of whiskey.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not much,\" said the trader, \"it was my last flask I wouldn't 'a'\r\nhad a drop for myself. But it just shows, how fond these Indians\r\nare of whiskey.\"\r\n\r\nWhile some of the Chipewyans show fine physique, and many do great\r\nfeats of strength and endurance, they seem on the whole inferior\r\nto whites.\r\n\r\nThus the strongest portager on the river is said to be Billy\r\nLoutit's brother George. At Athabaska Landing I was shown a house\r\non a hill, half a mile away, to which he had carried on his back\r\n450 pounds of flour without stopping. Some said it was only 350\r\npounds, but none made it less. As George is only three-quarters\r\nwhite, this is perhaps not a case in point. But during our stay\r\nat Fort Smith we had several athletic meets of Indians and whites,\r\nthe latter represented by Preble and the police boys, and no matter\r\nwhether in running, walking, high jumping, broad jumping, wrestling,\r\nor boxing, the whites were ahead.\r\n\r\nAs rifle-shots, also, the natives seem far inferior. In the matter\r\nof moose-hunting only, as already noted, the red-man was master.\r\nThis, of course, is a matter of life-long training. A white man\r\nbrought up to it would probably do as well as an Indian even in\r\nthis very Indian department.\r\n\r\nThese tribes are still in the hunting and fishing stage; they make\r\nno pretence of agriculture or stockraising. Except that they wear\r\nwhite man's clothes and are most of them nominally Roman Catholics,\r\nthey live as their fathers did 100 years ago. But there is one\r\nremarkable circumstance that impressed me more and more--practically\r\nevery Chipewyan reads and writes his own language.\r\n\r\nThis miracle was inborn on me slowly. On the first Buffalo hunt we\r\nhad found a smoothened pole stuck in the ground by the trail. It\r\nwas inscribed as herewith.\r\n\r\n\"What is that Sousi?\" \"It's a notice from Chief William that Swiggert\r\nwants men on the portage,\" and he translated it literally: \"The fat\r\nwhite man 5 scows, small white man 2 scows, gone down, men wanted\r\nfor Rapids, Johnnie Bolette this letter for you. (Signed) Chief\r\nWilliam.\"\r\n\r\nEach of our guides in succession had shown a similar familiarity\r\nwith the script of his people, and many times we found spideresque\r\ncharacters on tree or stone that supplied valuable information.\r\nThey could, however tell me nothing of its age or origin, simply\r\n\"We all do it; it is easy.\"\r\n\r\nAt Fort Resolution I met the Jesuit fathers and got the desired\r\nchance of learning about the Chipewyan script.\r\n\r\nFirst, it is not a true alphabet, but a syllabic; not letters, but\r\nsyllables, are indicated by each character; 73 characters are all\r\nthat are needed to express the whole language. It is so simple\r\nand stenographic that the fathers often use it as a rapid way of\r\nwriting French. It has, however, the disadvantage of ambiguity at\r\ntimes. Any Indian boy can learn it in a week or two; practically\r\nall the Indians use it. What a commentary on our own cumbrous and\r\nillogical spelling, which takes even a bright child two or three\r\nyears to learn!\r\n\r\nNow, I already knew something of the Cree syllabic invented by\r\nthe Rev. James Evans, Methodist missionary on Lake Winnipeg in the\r\n'40s, but Cree is a much less complex language; only 36 characters\r\nare needed, and these are so simple that an intelligent Cree can\r\nlearn to write his own language in one day.\r\n\r\nIn support, of this astounding statement I give, first, the 36\r\ncharacters which cover every fundamental sound in their language\r\nand then a sample of application. While crude and inconcise, it\r\nwas so logical and simple that in a few years the missionary had\r\ntaught practically the whole Cree nation to read and write. And\r\nLord Dufferin, when the matter came before him during his north-west\r\ntour, said enthusiastically: \"There have been men buried in\r\nWestminster Abbey with national honours whose claims to fame were\r\nfar less than those of this devoted missionary, the man who taught\r\na whole nation to read and write.\"\r\n\r\nThese things I knew, and now followed up my Jesuit source of\r\ninformation.\r\n\r\n\"Who invented this?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know for sure. It is in general use.\"\r\n\r\n\"Was it a native idea?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, no; some white man made it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where? Here or in the south?\"\r\n\r\n\"It came originally from the Crees, as near as we can tell.\"\r\n\r\n\"Was it a Cree or a missionary that first thought of it?\"\r\n\r\n\"I believe it was a missionary.\"\r\n\r\n\"Frankly, now, wasn't it invented in 1840 by Rev. James Evans,\r\nMethodist missionary to the Crees on Lake Winnipeg?\"\r\n\r\nOh, how he hated to admit it, but he was too honest to deny it.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, it seems to me it was some name like that. 'Je ne sais pas.'\"\r\n\r\nReader, take a map of North America, a large one, and mark off the\r\nvast area bounded by the Saskatchewan, the Rockies, the Hudson Bay,\r\nand the Arctic circle, and realise that in this region, as large\r\nas continental Europe outside of Russia and Spain, one simple,\r\nearnest man, inspired by the love of Him who alone is perfect\r\nlove, invented and popularised a method of writing that in a few\r\nyears--in less than a generation, indeed--has turned the whole native\r\npopulation from ignorant illiterates to a people who are proud to\r\nread and write their own language. This, I take it, is one of the\r\ngreatest feats of a civiliser. The world has not yet heard, much\r\nless comprehended, the magnitude of the achievement; when it does\r\nthere will be no name on the Canadian roll of fame that will stand\r\nhigher or be blazoned more brightly than that of James Evans the\r\nmissionary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII\r\n\r\nTHE DOGS OF FORT RESOLUTION\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt sounds like the opening of an epic poem but it is not.\r\n\r\nThe Chipewyan calender is divided in two seasons--dog season and\r\ncanoe season. What the horse is to the Arab, what the Reindeer is\r\nto the Lap and the Yak to the Thibetan, the dog is to the Chipewyan\r\nfor at least one-half of the year, until it is displaced by the\r\ncanoe.\r\n\r\nDuring dog season the canoes are piled away somewhat carelessly or\r\nguarded only from the sun. During canoe season the dogs are treated\r\natrociously. Let us remember, first, that these are dogs in every\r\ndoggy sense, the worshipping servants of man, asking nothing but\r\na poor living in return for abject love and tireless service, as\r\nwell as the relinquishment of all family ties and natural life. In\r\nwinter, because they cannot serve without good food, they are well\r\nfed on fish that is hung on scaffolds in the fall in time to be\r\nfrozen before wholly spoiled. The journeys they will make and the\r\ndevoted service they render at this time is none too strongly set\r\nforth in Butler's \"Cerf Vola\" and London's \"Call of the Wild.\" It\r\nis, indeed, the dog alone that makes life possible during the white\r\nhalf-year of the boreal calender. One cannot be many days in the\r\nnorth without hearing tales of dog prowess, devotion, and heroism.\r\nA typical incident was related as follows by Thomas Anderson:\r\n\r\nOver thirty years ago, Chief Factor George McTavish and his driver,\r\nJack Harvey, were travelling from East Main to Rupert's House (65\r\nmiles) in a blizzard so thick and fierce that they could scarcely\r\nsee the leading dog. He was a splendid, vigorous creature, but all\r\nat once he lay down and refused to go. The driver struck him, but\r\nthe factor reproved the man, as this dog had never needed the whip.\r\nThe driver then went ahead and found open water only a few feet\r\nfrom the dogs, though out of sight. After that they gave the leader\r\nfree rein, surrendered themselves to his guidance, and in spite of\r\nthe blinding blizzard they struck the flagpole of Rupert's between\r\n11 and 12 that night, only a little behind time.\r\n\r\nMany of the wild Wolf traits still remain with them. They commonly\r\npair; they bury surplus food; the mothers disgorge food for the\r\nyoung; they rally to defend one of their own clan against a stranger;\r\nand they punish failure with death.\r\n\r\nA thousand incidents might be adduced to show that in the north\r\nthere is little possibility of winter travel without dogs and little\r\npossibility of life without winter travel.\r\n\r\nBut April comes with melting snows and May with open rivers and\r\nbrown earth everywhere; then, indeed, the reign of the dog is over.\r\nThe long yellow-birch canoe is taken down from the shanty roof or\r\nfrom a sheltered scaffold, stitched, gummed, and launched; and the\r\ndogs are turned loose to fend for themselves. Gratitude for past\r\nservices or future does not enter into the owner's thoughts to\r\nsecure a fair allowance of food. All their training and instinct\r\nprompts them to hang about camp, where, kicked, stoned, beaten,\r\nand starved, they steal and hunt as best they may, until the sad\r\nseason of summer is worn away and merry winter with its toil and\r\ngood food is back once more.\r\n\r\nFrom leaving Fort MacMurray we saw daily the starving dog, and\r\nI fed them when I could. At Smith Landing the daily dog became a\r\ndaily fifty. One big fellow annexed us. \"I found them first,\" he\r\nseemed to say, and no other dog came about our camp without a fight.\r\n\r\nOf course he fared well on our scraps, but many a time it made my\r\nheart ache and my food-store suffer to see the gaunt skeletons in\r\nthe bushes, just beyond his sphere of influence, watching for a\r\nchance to rush in and secure a mouthful of--anything to stay the\r\ndevastating pang. My journal of the time sets forth in full detail\r\nthe diversity of their diet, not only every possible scrap of\r\nfish and meat or whatsoever smelled of fish or meat, but rawhide,\r\nleather, old boots, flour-bags, potato-peelings, soap, wooden\r\nfragments of meat-boxes, rags that have had enough animal contact\r\nto be odorous. An ancient dishcloth, succulent with active service,\r\nwas considered a treat to be bolted whole; and when in due course\r\nthe cloth was returned to earth, it was intact, bleached, purged, and\r\npurified as by chemic fires and ready for a new round of benevolences.\r\n\r\nIn some seasons the dogs catch Rabbits enough to keep them up. But\r\nthis year the Rabbits were gone. They are very clever at robbing\r\nfish-nets at times, but these were far from the fort. Reduced\r\nto such desperate straits for food, what wonder that cannibalism\r\nshould be common! Not only the dead, but the sick or disabled of\r\ntheir own kind are torn to pieces and devoured. I was told of one\r\ncase where a brutal driver disabled one of his dogs with heavy blows;\r\nits companions did not wait till it was dead before they feasted.\r\nIt is hard to raise pups because the mothers so often devour their\r\nown young; and this is a charge I never heard laid to the Wolf,\r\nthe ancestor of these dogs, which shows how sadly the creature has\r\nbeen deteriorated by contact with man. There seems no length to\r\nwhich they will not go for food. Politeness forbids my mentioning\r\nthe final diet for which they scramble around the camp. Never in my\r\nlife before have I seen such utter degradation by the power of the\r\nendless hunger pinch. Nevertheless--and here I expect the reader to\r\ndoubt, even as I did when first I heard it, no matter how desperate\r\ntheir straits-these gormandisers of unmentionable filth, these\r\nstarvelings, in their dire extremity will turn away in disgust from\r\nduck or any other web-footed water-fowl.\r\n\r\nBilly Loutit had shot a Pelican; the skin was carefully preserved\r\nand the body guarded for the dogs, thinking that this big thing,\r\nweighing 6 or 7 pounds, would furnish a feast for one or two. The\r\ndogs knew me, and rushed like a pack of Wolves at sight of coming\r\nfood. The bigger ones fought back the smaller. I threw the prize,\r\nbut, famished though they were, they turned away as a man might\r\nturn from a roasted human hand. One miserable creature, a mere\r\nskeleton, sneaked forward when the stronger ones were gone, pulled\r\nout the entrails at last, and devoured them as though he hated\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nI can offer no explanation. But the Hudson's Bay men tell me it is\r\nalways so, and I am afraid the remembrance of the reception accorded\r\nmy bounty that day hardened my heart somewhat in the days that\r\nfollowed.\r\n\r\nOn the Nyarling we were too far from mankind to be bothered\r\nwith dogs, but at Fort Resolution we reentered their country. The\r\nfollowing from my journal records the impression after our enforced\r\nthree days' stay:\r\n\r\n\"Tuesday, July 16, 1907.--Fine day for the first time since July\r\n3. At last we pulled out of Fort Resolution (9.40 A. M.). I never\r\nwas so thankful to leave a place where every one was kind. I think\r\nthe maddest cynophile would find a cure here. It is the worst\r\ndog-cursed spot I ever saw; not a square yard but is polluted\r\nby them; no article can be left on the ground but will be carried\r\noff, torn up, or defiled; the four corners of our tent have become\r\nregular stopping places for the countless canines, and are disfigured\r\nand made abominable, so that after our escape there will be needed\r\nmany days of kindly rain for their purification.  There certainly\r\nare several hundred dogs in the village; there are about 50 teepees\r\nand houses with 5 to 15 dogs at each, and 25 each at the mission\r\nand H. B. Co. In a short walk, about 200 yards, I passed 86 dogs.\r\n\r\n\"There is not an hour or ten minutes of day or night that is not\r\nmade hideous with a dog-fight or chorus of yelps. There are about\r\nsix different clans of dogs, divided as their owners are, and a\r\nDogrib dog entering the Yellow-knife or Chipewyan part of the camp\r\nis immediately set upon by all the residents. Now the clansmen of\r\nthe one in trouble rush to the rescue and there is a battle. Indians\r\nof both sides join in with clubs to belabour the fighters, and the\r\nyowling and yelping of those discomfited is painful to hear for\r\nlong after the fight is over. It was a battle like this, I have\r\nbeen told, which caused the original split of the tribe, one part\r\nof which went south to become the Apaches of Arizona. The scenes\r\ngo on all day and all night in different forms. A number of dogs\r\nare being broken in by being tied up to stakes. These keep up\r\na heart-rending and peculiar crying, beginning with a short bark\r\nwhich melts into a yowl and dies away in a nerve-racking wail.\r\nThis ceases not day or night, and half a dozen of these prisoners\r\nare within a stone's throw of our camp.\r\n\r\n\"The favourite place for the clan fights seems to be among\r\nthe guy-ropes of our tent; at least half a dozen of these general\r\nengagements take place every night while we try to sleep.\r\n\r\n\"Everything must be put on the high racks eight feet up to be safe\r\nfrom them; even empty tins are carried off, boots, hats, soap, etc.,\r\nare esteemed most toothsome morsels, and what they can neither eat,\r\ncarry off, nor destroy, they defile with elaborate persistency and\r\nprecision.\"\r\n\r\nA common trick of the Indians when canoe season arrives is, to put\r\nall the family and one or two of the best dogs in the canoes, then\r\npush away from the shore, leaving the rest behind. Those so abandoned\r\ncome howling after the canoes, and in unmistakable pleadings beg\r\nthe heartless owners to take them in. But the canoes push off toward\r\nthe open sea, aiming to get out of sight. The dogs howl sadly on\r\nthe shore, or swim after them till exhausted, then drift back to\r\nthe nearest land to begin the summer of hardship.\r\n\r\nIf Rabbits are plentiful they get along; failing these they catch\r\nmice or fish; when the berry season comes they eat fruit; the weaker\r\nones are devoured by their brethren; and when the autumn arrives\r\ntheir insensate owners generally manage to come back and pick up\r\nthe survivors, feeding them so that they are ready for travel when\r\ndog-time begins, and the poor faithful brutes, bearing no grudge,\r\nresume at once the service of their unfeeling masters.\r\n\r\nAll through our voyage up Great Slave Lake we daily heard the sad\r\nhowling of abandoned dogs, and nightly, we had to take steps to\r\nprevent them stealing our food and leathers. More than once in the\r\ndim light, I was awakened by a rustle, to see sneaking from my tent\r\nthe gray, wolfish form of some prowling dog, and the resentment I\r\nfelt at the loss inflicted, was never more than to make me shout\r\nor throw a pebble at him.\r\n\r\nOne day, as we voyaged eastward (July 23) in the Tal-thel-lay\r\nnarrows of Great Slave Lake, we met 5 canoes and 2 York boats of\r\nIndians going west. A few hours afterward as, we were nooning on\r\nan island (we were driven to the islands now) there came a long\r\nhowling from the rugged main shore, a mile away to the east of\r\nus; then it increased to a chorus of wailing, and we knew that the\r\nIndians had that morning abandoned their dogs there. The wailing\r\ncontinued, then we saw a tiny black speck coming from the far\r\nshore. When it was half-way across the ice-cold bay we could hear\r\nthe gasps of a tired swimmer. He got along fairly, dodging the cakes\r\nof ice, until within about 200 yards, when his course was barred\r\nby a long, thin, drifting floe. He tried to climb on it, but was\r\ntoo weak, then he raised his voice in melancholy howls of despair.\r\nI could not get to him, but he plucked up heart at length, and\r\nfeebly paddling went around till he found an opening, swam through\r\nand came on, the slowest dog swimmer I ever saw. At last he struck\r\nbottom and crawled out. But he was too weak and ill to eat the meat\r\nthat I had ready prepared for him. We left him with food for many\r\ndays and sailed away.\r\n\r\nAnother of the dogs that tried to follow him across was lost in the\r\nice; we heard his miserable wailing moans as he was carried away,\r\nbut could not help him. My Indians thought nothing of it and were\r\namused at my solicitude.\r\n\r\nA couple of hours later we landed on the rugged east coast to study\r\nour course through the ice. At once., we were met by four dogs that\r\ntrotted along the shore to where we landed. They did not seem very\r\ngaunt; one, an old yellow female, carried something in her mouth;\r\nthis she never laid down, and growled savagely when any of the others\r\ncame near. It proved to be the blood-stained leg of a new-killed\r\ndog, yellow like herself.\r\n\r\nAs we pulled out a big black-and-white fellow looked at us\r\nwistfully from a rocky ledge; memories of Bingo, whom he resembled\r\nnot a little, touched me. I threw him a large piece of dried meat.\r\nHe ate it, but not ravenously. He seemed in need, not of food, but\r\nof company.\r\n\r\nA few miles farther on we again landed to study the lake; as we\r\ncame near we saw the dogs, not four but six, now racing to meet\r\nus. I said to Preble: \"It seems to me it would be the part of mercy\r\nto shoot them all.\" He answered: \"They are worth nothing now, but\r\nyou shoot one and its value would at once jump up to one hundred\r\ndollars. Every one knows everything that is done in this country.\r\nYou would have six hundred dollars' damages to pay when you got\r\nback to Fort Resolution.\"\r\n\r\nI got out our stock of fresh fish. The Indians, seeing my purpose,\r\nsaid: \"Throw it in the water and see them dive.\" I did so and found\r\nthat they would dive into several feet of water and bring up the\r\nfish without fail. The yellow female was not here, so I suppose\r\nshe had stayed to finish her bone.\r\n\r\nWhen we came away, heading for the open lake, the dogs followed us\r\nas far as they could, then gathering on a flat rock, the end of a\r\nlong point, they sat down, some with their backs to us; all raised\r\ntheir muzzles and howled to the sky a heart-rending dirge.\r\n\r\nI was thankful to lose them in the distance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV\r\n\r\nTHE VOYAGE ACROSS THE LAKE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHitherto I have endeavoured to group my observations on each\r\nsubject; I shall now for a change give part of the voyage across\r\nGreat Slave Lake much, as it appears in my journal.\r\n\r\n\"July 16, 1907.--Left Fort Resolution at 9.40 A. M. in the York boat\r\nmanned by 7 Indians and Billy Loutit, besides Preble and myself, 10\r\nin all; ready with mast and sail for fair wind, but also provided\r\nwith heavy 16-foot oars for head-winds and calm. Harding says we\r\nshould make Pike's Portage in 3 or 4 days.\r\n\r\n\"Reached Moose Island at 11.30 chiefly by rowing; camped. A large\r\ndog appeared on the bank. Freesay recognised it as his and went\r\nashore with a club. We heard the dog yelping. Freesay came back\r\nsaying: 'He'll go home now.'\r\n\r\n\"At 1.30 went on but stopped an unnecessary half-hour at a saw-mill\r\ngetting plank for seats. Reached the Big, or Main, River at 4.10;\r\nstopped for tea again till 4.50, then rowed up the river till 5.40;\r\nrested 15 minutes, rowed till 6.30; rested 15 minutes, rowed till\r\n7; then got into the down current of the north branch or mouth of\r\nthe Slave; down then we drifted till 8, then landed and made another\r\nmeal, the fourth to-day, and went on drifting at 8.30.\r\n\r\n\"At 9.30 we heard a Ruffed Grouse drumming, the last of the season,\r\nalso a Bittern pumping, some Cranes trumpeting, and a Wood Frog\r\ncroaking. Snipe were still whirring in the sky. Saw Common Tern.\r\n\r\n\"At 10.15, still light, we camped for the night and made another\r\nmeal. The Indians went out and shot 2 Muskrats, making 7 the total\r\nof these I have seen in the country. This is the very lowest ebb.\r\nWhy are they so scarce? Their low epoch agrees with that of the\r\nRabbits.\r\n\r\n\"July 17.--Rose at 6 (it should have been 4, but the Indians would\r\nnot rouse); sailed north through the marsh with a light east breeze.\r\nAt noon this changed to a strong wind blowing from the north, as it\r\nhas done with little variation ever since I came to the country. These\r\nIndians know little of handling a boat and resent any suggestion.\r\nThey maintain their right, to row or rest, as they please, and land\r\nwhen and where they think best. We camped on a sand-bar and waited\r\ntill night; most exasperating when we are already behind time. The\r\nIndians set a net, using for tie-strings the bark of the willow\r\n(Salix bebbiana). They caught a Jack-fish. Reached Stony Island at\r\nnight, after many stops and landings. The Indians land whenever in\r\ndoubt and make a meal (at my expense), and are in doubt every two\r\nhours or so. They eat by themselves and have their own cook. Billy\r\ncooks for us, i.e., Preble, Weeso, and myself. Among the crew I\r\nhear unmistakable grumblings about the food, which is puzzling, as\r\nit is the best they ever had in their lives; there is great variety\r\nand no limit to the quantity.\r\n\r\n\"Made 6 meals and 17 miles to-day, rowing 7, sailing 10.\r\n\r\n\"July 18.--Left Stony Island at 6.55; could not get the crew started\r\nsooner; sailing with a light breeze which soon died down and left\r\nus on a sea of glass. I never before realised how disgusting a calm\r\ncould be.\r\n\r\n\"Camped at 9.15 on one of the countless, unnamed, uncharted islands\r\nof the lake. It is very beautiful in colour, red granite, spotted\r\nwith orange and black lichen on its face, and carpeted with caribou\r\nmoss and species of cetraria, great patches of tripe-de-roche, beds\r\nof saxifrage, long trailers, and masses of bearberry, empetrum,\r\nground cedar, juniper, cryptograma, and many others; while the\r\ntrees, willow, birch, and spruce are full of character and drawing.\r\nSky and lake are in colour worthy of these rich details, the bird\r\nlife is well represented and beautiful; there is beauty everywhere,\r\nand 'only man is vile.'\r\n\r\n\"I am more and more disgusted with my Indian crew; the leader in\r\nmischief seems to be young Beaulieu. Yesterday he fomented a mutiny\r\nbecause I did not give them 'beans,' though I had given them far\r\nmore than promised, and beans were never mentioned. Still, he had\r\ndiscovered a bag of them among my next month's stores, and that\r\nstarted him.\r\n\r\n\"To-day, when sick of seeing them dawdling two hours over a meal\r\nwhen there are 6 meals a day, I gave the order to start. Beaulieu\r\ndemanded insolently: 'Oh! who's boss?' My patience was worn out.\r\nI said: 'I am, and I'll show you right now,' and proceeded to do\r\nso, meaning to let him have my fist with all the steam I could get\r\nback of it. But he did not wait. At a safe distance he turned and\r\nin a totally different manner said: 'I only want to know; I thought\r\nmaybe the old man (the guide). I'll do it, all ri, all ri,' and he\r\nsmiled and smiled.\r\n\r\n\"Oh! why did I not heed Pike's warning to shun all Beaulieus; they\r\nrarely fail to breed trouble. If I had realised all this last night\r\nbefore coming to the open lake I would have taken the whole outfit\r\nback to Resolution and got rid of the crowd. We could do better\r\nwith another canoe and two men, and at least make better time than\r\nthis (17 miles a day).\r\n\r\n\"Yesterday the Indian boys borrowed my canoe, my line, and in my\r\ntime, at my expense, caught a big fish, but sullenly disregarded\r\nthe suggestion that, I should have a piece of it.\r\n\r\n\"Each of them carries a Winchester and blazes at every living\r\nthing that appears. They have volleyed all day at every creature\r\nbig enough to afford a mouthful--Ducks, Gulls, Loons, Fish, Owls,\r\nTerns, etc.--but have hit nothing. Loons are abundant in the water\r\nand are on the Indians' list of Ducks, therefore good food. They\r\nare wonderfully expert at calling them. This morning a couple of\r\nLoons appeared flying far to the east. The Indians at once began\r\nto mimic their rolling whoo-ooo-whoo-ooo; doing it to the life. The\r\nLoons began to swing toward us, then to circle, each time nearer.\r\nThen all the callers stopped except Claw-hammer, the expert; he\r\nbegan to utter a peculiar cat-like wail. The Loons responded and\r\ndropped their feet as though to alight. Then at 40 yards the whole\r\ncrew blazed away with their rifles, doing no damage whatever. The\r\nLoons turned away from these unholy callers, and were none the\r\nworse, but wiser.\r\n\r\n\"This scene was repeated many times during the voyage. When the\r\nLoons are on the water the Indians toll them by flashing a tin pan\r\nfrom the bushes behind which the toller hides till the bird is in\r\nrange. I saw many clever tollings but I did not see a Loon killed.\r\n\r\n\"July 19.--I got up at 4, talked strong talk, so actually got away\r\nat 5.30. Plenty grumbling, many meals to-day, with many black looks\r\nand occasional remarks in English: 'Grub no good.' Three days ago\r\nthese men were starving on one meal a day, of fish and bad flour;\r\nnow they have bacon, dried venison, fresh fish, fresh game, potatoes,\r\nflour, baking powder, tea, coffee, milk, sugar, molasses, lard,\r\ncocoa, dried apples, rice, oatmeal, far more than was promised,\r\nall ad libitum, and the best that the H. B. Co. can supply, and yet\r\nthey grumble. There is only one article of the food store to which\r\nthey have not access; that is a bag of beans which I am reserving\r\nfor our own trip in the north where weight counts for so much.\r\nBeaulieu smiles when I speak to him, but I know he is at the bottom\r\nof all this mischief. To day they made 6 meals and 17 miles--this\r\nis magnificent.\r\n\r\n\"About 7.30 a pair of Wild Geese (Canada) appeared on a bay. The\r\nboys let off a whoop of delight and rushed on them in canoe and in\r\nboat as though these were their deadliest enemies. I did not think\r\nmuch of it until I noticed that the Geese would not fly, and it\r\ndawned on me that they were protecting their young behind their own\r\nbodies. A volley of shot-guns and Winchesters and one noble head\r\nfell flat on the water, another volley and the gander fell, then\r\na wild skurrying, yelling, and shooting for some minutes resulted\r\nin the death of the two downlings.\r\n\r\n\"I could do nothing to stop them. I have trouble enough in matters\r\nthat are my business and this they consider solely their own. It\r\nis nothing but kill, kill, kill every living thing they meet. One\r\ncannot blame them in general, since they live by hunting, and in\r\nthis case they certainly did eat every bit of all four birds, even\r\nto their digestive organs with contents; but it seemed hard to have\r\nthe devotion of the parents made their death trap when, after all,\r\nwe were not in need of meat.\r\n\r\n\"July 20.--Rose at 4; had trouble on my hands at once. The Indians\r\nwould not get up till 5, so we did not get away till 6.20. Beaulieu\r\nwas evidently instructing the crew, for at the third breakfast all\r\ntogether (but perhaps 2) shouted out in English, 'Grub no good!\r\n\r\n\"I walked over, to them, asked who spoke; no one answered; so, I\r\nreviewed the bargain, pointed out that I had given more than agreed,\r\nand added: 'I did not promise you beans, but will say now that if\r\nyou work well I'll give you a bean feast once in a while.'\r\n\r\n\"They all said in various tongues and ways, 'That's all ri.' Beaulieu\r\nsaid it several times, and smiled and smiled.\r\n\r\n\"If the mythical monster that dwells in the bottom of Great Slave\r\nLake had reached up its long neck now and taken this same half-breed\r\nson of Belial, I should have said, 'Well done, good and faithful\r\nmonster,' and the rest of our voyage would have been happier. Oh!\r\nwhat a lot of pother a beneficent little bean can make.\r\n\r\n\"At noon that day Billy announced that it was time to give me a\r\nlobstick; a spruce was selected on a slate island and trimmed to\r\nits proper style, then inscribed:\r\n\r\n\r\nE. T. SETON\r\nE. A. PREBLE\r\nW. C. LOUTIT\r\n20 July\r\n1907\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Now I was in honour bound to treat, the crew. I had neither the\r\npower nor the wish to give whiskey. Tobacco was already provided,\r\nso I seized the opportunity of smoothing things by announcing a\r\nfeast of beans, and this, there was good reason to believe, went\r\nfar in the cause of peace.\r\n\r\n\"At 1.30 for the first time a fair breeze sprang up or rather lazily\r\ngot up. Joyfully then we raised our mast and sail. The boys curled\r\nup to sleep, except Beaulieu. He had his fiddle and now he proceeded\r\nto favour us with 'A Life on the Ocean Wave,' 'The Campbells are\r\nComing,' etc., in a manner worthy of his social position and of\r\nhis fiddle. When not in use this aesthetic instrument (in its box)\r\nknocks about on deck or underfoot, among pots and pans, exposed in\r\nall weather; no one seems to fear it will be injured.\r\n\r\n\"At 7 the usual dead calm was restored. We rowed till we reached\r\nEt-then Island at 8, covering two miles more or 32 in all to-day.\r\nI was unwilling to stop now, but the boys, said they would row all\r\nday Sunday if I would camp here, and then added, 'And if the wind\r\nrises to-night we'll go on.'\r\n\r\n\"At 10 o'clock I was already in bed for the night, though of course\r\nit was broad daylight. Preble had put out a line of mouse-traps,\r\nwhen the cry was raised by the Indians now eating their 7th meal:\r\nChim-pal-le! Hurra! Chilla quee!' ('Sailing wind! Hurra, boys!').\r\n\r\n\"The camp was all made, but after such a long calm a sailing wind\r\nwas too good to miss. In 10 minutes every tent was torn down and\r\nbundled into the boat. At 10.10 we pulled out under a fine promising\r\nbreeze; but alas! for its promise! at 10.30 the last vestige of\r\nit died away and we had to use the oars to make the nearest land,\r\nwhere we tied up at 11 P. M.\r\n\r\n\"That night old Weeso said to me, through Billy, the interpreter:\r\n'To-morrow is Sunday, therefore he would like to have a prayer-meeting\r\nafter breakfast.'\r\n\r\n\"'Tell him,' I said, 'that I quite approve of his prayer-meeting,\r\nbut also it must be understood that if the good Lord sends us a\r\nsailing wind in the morning that is His way of letting us know we\r\nshould sail.'\r\n\r\n\"This sounded so logical that Weeso meekly said, 'All right.'\r\n\r\n\"Sure enough, the morning dawned with a wind and we got away after\r\nthe regular sullen grumbling. About 10.20 the usual glassy calm set\r\nin and Weeso asked me for a piece of paper and a pencil. He wrote\r\nsomething in Chipewyan on the sheet I gave, then returned the pencil\r\nand resumed his pilotic stare at the horizon, for his post was at\r\nthe rudder. At length he rolled the paper into a ball, and when I\r\nseemed not observing dropped it behind him overboard.\r\n\r\n\"'What is the meaning of that, Billy?' I whispered.\r\n\r\n\"'He's sending a prayer to Jesus for wind.' Half an hour afterward\r\na strong head-wind sprang up, and Weeso was severely criticised\r\nfor not specifying clearly what was wanted.\r\n\r\n\"There could be no question now about the propriety of landing.\r\nOld Weeso took all the Indians off to a rock, where, bareheaded\r\nand in line, they kneeled facing the east, and for half an hour he\r\nled them in prayer, making often the sign of the cross. The headwind\r\ndied away as they came to the boat and again we resumed the weary\r\nrowing, a labour which all were supposed to share, but it did not\r\nneed an expert to see that Beaulieu, Snuff, and Terchon merely\r\ndipped their oars and let them drift a while; the real rowing of\r\nthat cumbrous old failure of a sailboat was done by Billy Loutit\r\nand Yum Freesay.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV\r\n\r\nCROSSING THE LAKE--ITS NATURAL HISTORY\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAll day long here, as on the Nyarling, I busied myself with compass\r\nand sketch-book, making the field notes, sketches, and compass\r\nsurveys from which my various maps were compiled; and Preble let no\r\nchance go by of noting the changing bird and plant life that told\r\nus we quit the Canadian fauna at Stony Island and now were in the\r\nHudsonian zone.\r\n\r\nThis is the belt of dwindling trees, the last or northmost zone of\r\nthe forest, and the spruce trees showed everywhere that they were\r\nliving a life-long battle, growing and seeding, but dwarfed by\r\nfrost and hardships. But sweet are the uses of adversity, and the\r\nstunted sprucelings were beautified, not uglified, by their troubles.\r\nI never before realised that a whole country could be such a series\r\nof charming little Japanese gardens, with tiny trees, tiny flowers,\r\ntiny fruits, and gorgeous oriental rugs upon the earth and rocks\r\nbetween.\r\n\r\nI photographed one group of trees to illustrate their dainty elfish\r\ndwarfishness, but realising that no one could guess the height\r\nwithout a scale, I took a second of the same with a small Indian\r\nsitting next it.\r\n\r\nWeeso is a kind old soul;  so far as I could see he took no part\r\nin the various seditions, but he was not an inspiring guide. One\r\nafternoon he did something that made a final wreck of my confidence.\r\nA thunderstorm was rumbling in the far east. Black clouds began\r\ntravelling toward us; with a line of dark and troubled waters below,\r\nthe faint breeze changed around and became a squall. Weeso looked\r\nscared and beckoned to Freesay, who came and took the helm. Nothing\r\nhappened.\r\n\r\nWe were now running along the north shore of Et-then, where are to\r\nbe seen the wonderful 1,200-foot cliffs described and figured by\r\nCaptain George Back in 1834. They are glorious ramparts, wonderful\r\nin size and in colour, marvellous in their geological display.\r\n\r\nFlying, and evidently nesting among the dizzy towers, were a few\r\nBarn-swallows and Phoebe-birds.\r\n\r\nThis cliff is repeated on Oot-sing-gree-ay, the next island, but\r\nthere it is not on the water's edge. It gives a wonderful echo which\r\nthe Indians (not to mention myself) played with, in childish fashion.\r\n\r\nOn Sunday, 21 July, we made a new record, 6 meals and 20 miles.\r\n\r\nOn July 22 we made only 7 meals and 11 miles and camped in the\r\nnarrows Tal-thel-lay. These are a quarter of a mile wide and have\r\na strong current running westerly. This is the place which Back\r\nsays is a famous fishing ground and never freezes over, even in the\r\nhardest winters. Here, as at all points, I noted the Indian names,\r\nnot only because they were appropriate, but in hopes of serving the\r\nnext traveller. I found an unexpected difficulty in writing them\r\ndown, viz.: no matter how I pronounced them, old Weeso and Freesay,\r\nmy informants, would say, \"Yes, that is right.\" This, I learned,\r\nwas out of politeness; no matter how you mispronounce their words\r\nit is good form to say, \"That's it; now you have it exactly.\"\r\n\r\nThe Indians were anxious to put out a net overnight here, as they\r\ncould count on getting a few Whitefish; so we camped at 5.15. It is\r\ndifficult to convey to an outsider the charm of the word \"whitefish.\"\r\nAny northerner will tell you that it is the only fish that is\r\nperfect human food, the only food that man or dog never wearies of,\r\nthe only lake food that conveys no disorder no matter how long or\r\nfreely it is used. It is so delicious and nourishing that there\r\nis no fish in the world that can even come second to it. It is as\r\nfar superior in all food qualities to the finest Salmon or Trout as\r\na first-prize, gold-medalled, nut-fed thoroughbred Sussex bacon-hog\r\nis to the roughest, toughest, boniest old razor-backed land-pike\r\nthat ever ranged the woods of Arkansas.\r\n\r\nThat night the net yielded 3 Whitefish and 3 Trout. The latter,\r\nbeing 4 to 8 pounds each, would have been reckoned great prizes\r\nin any other country, but now all attention was on the Whitefish.\r\nThey certainly were radiantly white, celestial in color; their\r\nbacks were a dull frosted silver, with here and there a small\r\nelectric lamp behind the scales to make its jewels sparkle. The\r\nlamps alternated with opals increased on the side; the bellies were\r\nof a blazing mother-of-pearl. It would be hard to imagine a less\r\nimaginative name than \"white\" fish for such a shining, burning\r\nopalescence. Indian names are usually descriptive, but their name\r\nfor this is simply \"The Fish.\" All others are mere dilutes and cheap\r\nimitations, but the Coregonus is at all times and par excellence\r\n\"The Fish.\"\r\n\r\nNevertheless, in looking at it I could not help feeling that this\r\nis the fat swine, or the beef Durham of its kind. The head, gills,\r\nfins, tail, vital organs and bones all were reduced to a minimum\r\nand the meat parts enlarged and solidified, as though they were\r\nthe product of ages of careful breeding by man to produce a perfect\r\nfood fish, a breeding that has been crowned with the crown of\r\nabsolute success.\r\n\r\nThe Indians know, for the best of reasons, the just value of every\r\nnative food. When Rabbits abound they live on them but do not\r\nprosper; they call it \"starving on rabbits.\" When Caribou meat is\r\nplenty they eat it, but crave flour. When Moose is at hand they\r\neat it, and are strong. When Jack-fish, Sucker, Conies, and Trout\r\nare there, they take them as a variant; but on Whitefish, as on\r\nMoose, they can live with out loathing, and be strong. The Indian\r\nwho has his scaffold hung with Whitefish when winter comes,  is\r\naccounted rich.\r\n\r\n\"And what,\" says the pessimist, \"is the fly in all this precious\r\nointment?\" Alasl It is not a game fish; it will not take bait,\r\nspoon, or fly, and its finest properties vanish in a few hours\r\nafter capture.\r\n\r\nThe Whitefish served in the marble palaces of other lands is as\r\nmere dish-water to champagne, when compared with the three times\r\npurified and ten times intensified dazzling silver Coregonus as\r\nit is landed on the bleak shores of those far-away icy lakes. So\r\nI could not say 'No' to the Indian boys when they wanted to wait\r\nhere, the last point at which they could be sure of a catch.\r\n\r\nThat night (22d July) five canoes and two York boats of Indians\r\nlanded at the narrows. These were Dogribs of Chief Vital's band;\r\nall told they numbered about thirty men, women, and children; with\r\nthem were twenty-odd dogs, which immediately began to make trouble.\r\nWhen one is in Texas the topic of conversation is, \"How are the\r\ncattle?\" in the Klondike, \"How is your claim panning out?\" and in\r\nNew York, \"How are you getting on with your novel?\" On Great Slave\r\nLake you say, \"Where are the Caribou?\" The Indians could not tell;\r\nthey had seen none for weeks, but there was still much ice in the\r\neast end of the lake which kept them from investigating. They had\r\nplenty of dried Caribou meat but were out of tea and tobacco. I had\r\ncome prepared for this sort of situation, and soon we had a fine\r\nstock of dried venison.\r\n\r\nThese were the Indians whose abandoned dogs made so much trouble\r\nfor us in the days that followed.\r\n\r\nAt 4 P. M. of 23d of July we were stopped by a long narrow floe of\r\nbroken ice. Without consulting me the crew made for the shore.\r\n\r\nIt seemed they were full of fears: \"What if they should get caught\r\nin that floe, and drift around for days? What if a wind should\r\narise (it had been glassy calm for a week)? What if they could',\r\nnot get back?\" etc., etc.\r\n\r\nPreble and I climbed a hill for a view. The floe was but half a\r\nmile wide, very loose, with frequent lanes.\r\n\r\n\"Preble, is there any reason why we should not push through this\r\nfloe using poles to move the cakes?\"\r\n\r\n\"None whatever.\"\r\n\r\nOn descending, however, I found the boys preparing to camp for \"a\r\ncouple of days,\" while the ice melted or drifted away somewhere.\r\n\r\nSo I said, \"You get right into this boat now and push off; we can\r\neasily work our way through.\" They made no reply, simply looked\r\nsulkier than ever, and proceeded to start a fire for meal No. 5.\r\n\r\n\"Weeso,\" I said, \"get into your place and tell your men to follow.\"\r\n\r\nThe old man looked worried and did nothing, He wanted to do right,\r\nbut he was in awe of his crew.\r\n\r\nThen did I remember how John MacDonald settled the rebellion on\r\nthe river.\r\n\r\n\"Get in there,\" I said to Preble and Billy. \"Come on, Weeso.\" We\r\nfour jumped into the boat and proceeded to push off with all the\r\nsupplies.\r\n\r\nAuthorities differ as to the time it took for the crew to make up\r\ntheir minds. Two seconds and eleven seconds are perhaps the extremes\r\nof estimate. They came jumping aboard as fast as they could.\r\n\r\nWe attacked the floe, each with a lodge-pole; that is, Billy and\r\nPreble did in the bow, while Freesay and I did at the rear; and\r\nin thirty-five minutes we had pushed through and were sailing the\r\nopen sea.\r\n\r\nThe next day we had the same scene repeated with less intensity,\r\nin this case because Freesay sided with me. What would I not give\r\nto have had a crew of white men. A couple of stout Norwegian sailors\r\nwould have done far better than this whole outfit of reds.\r\n\r\nWhen we stopped for supper No. 1 a tiny thimbleful of down on two\r\npink matches ran past, and at once the mother, a Peetweet, came\r\nrunning in distress to save her young. The brave Beaulieu fearlessly\r\nseized a big stick and ran to kill the little one. I shouted out,\r\n\"Stop that,\" in tones that implied that I owned the heaven, the\r\nearth, the sea, and all that in them is, but could not have saved\r\nthe downling had it not leaped into the water and dived out of\r\nsight. It came up two feet away and swam to a rock of safety, where\r\nit bobbed its latter end toward its adversaries and the open sea\r\nin turn.\r\n\r\nI never before knew that they could dive.\r\n\r\nAbout eight o'clock we began to look for a good place to camp and\r\nmake meal No. 6. But the islands where usually we found refuge\r\nfrom the dogs were without wood, and the shores were too rugged\r\nand steep or had no dry timber, so we kept going on. After trying\r\none or two places the Indians said it was only a mile to Indian\r\nMountain River (Der-sheth Tessy), where was a camp of their friends.\r\nI was always glad of a reason for pushing on, so away we went. My\r\ncrew seized their rifles and fired to let their village know we were\r\ncoming. The camp came quickly into view, and volley after volley\r\nwas fired and returned.\r\n\r\nThese Indians are extremely poor and the shots cost 5 and 6 cents\r\neach. So this demonstration totalled up about $2.00.\r\n\r\nAs we drew near the village of lodges the populace lined up on shore,\r\nand then our boys whispered, \"Some white men.\" What a peculiar\r\nthrill it gave me! I had seen nothing but Indians along the route\r\nso far and expected nothing else. But here were some of my own\r\npeople, folk with whom I could talk. They proved to be my American\r\nfriend from Smith Landing, he whose hand I had lanced, and his\r\ncompanion, a young Englishman, who was here with him prospecting\r\nfor gold and copper. \"I'm all right now,\" he said, and, held up\r\nthe hand with my mark on it, and our greeting was that of white\r\nmen meeting among strangers in a far foreign land.\r\n\r\nAs soon as we were ashore a number of Indians came to offer meat\r\nfor tobacco. They seemed a lot of tobacco-maniacs. \"Tzel-twee\" at\r\nany price they must have. Food they could do without for a long\r\ntime, but life without smoke was intolerable; and they offered their\r\nwhole dried product of two Caribou, concentrated, nourishing food\r\nenough to last a family many days, in exchange for half a pound of\r\nnasty stinking, poisonous tobacco.\r\n\r\nTwo weeks hence, they say, these hills will be alive with Caribou;\r\nalas! for them, it proved a wholly erroneous forecast.\r\n\r\nY.'s guide is Sousi King Beaulieu (for pedigree, see Warburton\r\nPike); he knows all this country well and gave us much information\r\nabout the route. He says that this year the Caribou cows went north\r\nas usual, but the bulls did not. The season was so late they did\r\nnot think it worth while; they are abundant yet at Artillery Lake.\r\n\r\nHe recognised me as the medicine man, and took an early opportunity\r\nof telling me what a pain he had. Just where, he was not sure,\r\nbut it was hard to bear; he would like some sort of a pain-killer.\r\nEvidently he craved a general exhilarator.  Next morning we got\r\naway at 7 A. M. after the usual painful scene about getting up in\r\nthe middle of the night, which was absurd, as there was no night.\r\n\r\nNext afternoon we passed the Great White Fall at the mouth of Hoar\r\nFrost River; the Indians call it Dezza Kya. If this is the Beverly\r\nFalls of Back, his illustrator was without information; the published\r\npicture bears not the slightest resemblance to it.\r\n\r\nAt three in the afternoon of July 27th, the twelfth day after we\r\nhad set out on the \"three or four day run\" from Resolution, this\r\nexasperating and seemingly interminable voyage really did end, and\r\nwe thankfully beached our York boat at the famous lobstick that\r\nmarks the landing of Pike's Portage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI\r\n\r\nTHE LYNX AT BAY\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of the few rewarding episodes of this voyage took place on the\r\nlast morning, July 27. We were half a mile from Charleston Harbour\r\nwhen one of the Indians said \"Cheesay\" (Lynx) and pointed to the\r\nsouth shore. There, on a bare point a quarter mile away, we saw a\r\nlarge Lynx walking quietly along. Every oar was dropped and every\r\nrifle seized, of course, to repeat the same old scene; probably\r\nit would have made no difference to the Lynx, but I called out:\r\n\"Hold on there! I'm going after that Cheesay.\"\r\n\r\nCalling my two reliables, Preble and Billy, we set out in the canoe,\r\narmed, respectively, with a shotgun, a club, and a camera.\r\n\r\nWhen we landed the Lynx was gone. We hastily made a skirmishing line\r\nin the wood where the point joined the mainland, but saw no sign of\r\nhim, so concluded that he must be hiding on the point. Billy took\r\nthe right shore, Preble the left, I kept the middle. Then we marched\r\ntoward the point but saw nothing. There were no bushes except a low\r\nthicket of spruce, some 20 feet across and 3 or 4 feet high. This\r\nwas too dense to penetrate standing, so I lay down on my breast\r\nand proceeded to crawl in under the low boughs. I had not gone six\r\nfeet before a savage growl warned me back, and there, just ahead,\r\ncrouched the Lynx. He glared angrily, then rose up, and I saw, with\r\na little shock, that he had been crouching on the body of another\r\nLynx, eating it. Photography was impossible there, so I took a\r\nstick and poked at him; he growled, struck at the stick, but went\r\nout, then dashed across the open for the woods. As he went I got\r\nphotograph No. 1. Now I saw the incredible wonder I had heard of--a\r\ngood runner can outrun a Lynx. Preble was a sprinter, and before the\r\ntimber 200 yards off was reached that Lynx was headed and turned;\r\nand Preble and Billy were driving him back into my studio. He made\r\nseveral dashes to escape, but was out-manoeuvred and driven onto\r\nthe far point, where he was really between the devils and the deep\r\nsea. Here he faced about at bay, growling furiously, thumping his\r\nlittle bobtail from side to side, and pretending he was going to\r\nspring on us. I took photo No. 2 at 25 yards. He certainly did look\r\nvery fierce, but I thought I knew the creature, as well as the men\r\nwho were backing me. I retired, put a new film in place, and said:\r\n\r\n\"Now, Preble, I'm going to walk up to that Lynx and get a close\r\nphoto. If he jumps for me, and he may, there is nothing can save\r\nmy beauty but you and that gun.\"\r\n\r\nPreble with characteristic loquacity says, \"Go ahead.\"\r\n\r\nThen I stopped and began slowly approaching the desperate creature\r\nwe held at bay. His eyes were glaring green, his ears were back,\r\nhis small bobtail kept twitching from side to side, and his growls\r\ngrew harder and hissier, as I neared him. At 15 feet he gathered his\r\nlegs under him as for a spring, and I pressed the button getting,\r\nNo. 3.\r\n\r\nThen did the demon of ambition enter into my heart and lead me\r\ninto peril. That Lynx at bay was starving and desperate. He might\r\nspring at me, but I believed that if he did he never would reach\r\nme alive. I knew my man--this nerved me--and I said to him: \"I'm\r\nnot satisfied; I want him to fill the finder. Are you ready?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yep.\"\r\n\r\nSo I crouched lower and came still nearer, and at 12 feet made No.\r\n4. For some strange reason, now the Lynx seemed less angry than he\r\nhad been.\r\n\r\n\"He didn't fill the finder; I'll try again,\" was my next. Then\r\non my knees I crawled up, watching the finder till it was full of\r\nLynx. I glanced at the beast; he was but 8 feet away. I focused\r\nand fired.\r\n\r\nAnd now, oh, wonder! that Lynx no longer seemed annoyed; he had\r\nceased growling and simply looked bored.\r\n\r\nSeeing it was over, Preble says, \"Now where does he go? To the\r\nMuseum?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, indeed!\" was the reply. \"He surely has earned his keep; turn\r\nhim loose. It's back to the woods for him.\" We stood aside; he saw\r\nhis chance and dashed for the tall timber. As he went I fired the\r\nlast film, getting No. 6; and so far as I know that Lynx is alive\r\nand well and going yet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVII\r\n\r\nTHE LAST OF THAT INDIAN CREW\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCarved on the lobstick of the Landing were many names famous in\r\nthe annals of this region, Pike, Maltern, McKinley, Munn, Tyrrel\r\namong them. All about were evidences of an ancient and modern\r\ncamp--lodge poles ready for the covers, relics and wrecks of all\r\nsorts, fragments of canoes and sleds, and the inevitable stray\r\nIndian dog.\r\n\r\nFirst we made a meal, of course; then I explained to the crew that\r\nI wanted all the stuff carried over the portage, 31 miles, to the\r\nfirst lake. At once there was a row; I was used to that. There had\r\nbeen a row every morning over getting up, and one or two each day\r\nabout other details. Now the evil face of Beaulieu showed that his\r\ntongue was at work again. But I knew my lesson.\r\n\r\n\"You were brought to man the boat and bring my stuff over this\r\nportage. So do it and start right now.\"\r\n\r\nThey started 3 1/4 miles with heavy loads, very heavy labour I must\r\nadmit, back then in four hours to make another meal, and camp.\r\n\r\nNext morning another row before they would get up and take each\r\nanother load. But canoe and everything were over by noon. And then\r\ncame the final scene.\r\n\r\nIn all the quarrels and mutinies, old Weeso had been faithful to\r\nme. Freesay had said little or nothing, and had always worked well\r\nand cheerfully. Weeso was old and weak, Freesay young and strong,\r\nand therefore he was the one for our canoe. I decided it would pay\r\nto subsidise Weeso to resign in favour of the younger man. But, to\r\nbe sure, first asked Freesay if he would like to come with me to\r\nthe land of the Musk-ox. His answer was short and final, \"Yes,\"\r\nbut he could not, as his uncle had told him not to go beyond this\r\nportage. That settled it. The childlike obedience to their elders\r\nis admirable, but embarrassing at times.\r\n\r\nSo Weeso went after all, and we got very well acquainted on that\r\nlong trip. He was a nice old chap. He always meant well; grinned\r\nso happily, when he was praised, and looked so glum when he was\r\nscolded. There was little of the latter to do; so far as he knew,\r\nhe did his best, and it is a pleasure now to conjure up his face\r\nand ways. His cheery voice, at my tent door every morning, was the\r\nsignal that Billy had the breakfast within ten minutes of ready.\r\n\r\n\"Okimow, To\" (Chief, here is water), he would say as he set down\r\nthe water for my bath and wondered what in the name of common sense\r\nshould make the Okimow need washing every morning. He himself was\r\nof a cleaner kind, having needed no bath during the whole term of\r\nour acquaintance.\r\n\r\nThere were two peculiarities of the old man that should make him\r\na good guide for the next party going northward. First, he never\r\nforgot a place once he had been there, and could afterward go to\r\nit direct from any other place. Second, he had the most wonderful\r\nnose for firewood; no keen-eyed raven or starving wolf could go more\r\nsurely to a marrow-bone in cache, than could Weeso to the little\r\nsticks in far away hollows or granite clefts. Again and again,\r\nwhen we landed on the level or rocky shore and all hands set out\r\nto pick up the few pencil-thick stems of creeping birch, roots\r\nof annual plants, or wisps of grass to boil the kettle, old Weeso\r\nwould wander off by himself and in five minutes return with an\r\narmful of the most amazingly acceptable firewood conjured out of\r\nthe absolutely timberless, unpromising waste. I never yet saw the\r\ncamp where he could not find wood. So he proved good stuff; I was\r\nglad we had brought him along.\r\n\r\nAnd I was equally glad now to say good-bye to the rest of the crew.\r\nI gave them provisions for a week, added a boiling of beans, and\r\nfinally the wonderful paper in which I stated the days they had\r\nworked for me, and the kind of service they had rendered, commended\r\nFreesay, and told the truth about Beaulieu.\r\n\r\n\"Dat paper tell about me,\" said that worthy suspiciously.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" I said, \"and about the others; and it tells Harding to pay\r\nyou as agreed.\"\r\n\r\nWe all shook hands and parted. I have not seen them since, nor do\r\nI wish to meet any of them again, except Freesay.\r\n\r\nMy advice to the next traveller would be: get white men for the trip\r\nand one Indian for guide. When alone they are manageable, and some\r\nof them, as seen already, are quite satisfactory, but the more of\r\nthem the worse. They combine, as Pike says, the meanest qualities\r\nof a savage and an unscrupulous moneylender. The worst one in the\r\ncrowd seems most readily followed by the others.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVIII\r\n\r\nGEOLOGICAL FORCES AT WORK\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt seems to me that never before have I seen the geological forces\r\nof nature so obviously at work. Elsewhere I have seen great valleys,\r\ncliffs, islands, etc., held on good evidence to be the results of\r\nsuch and such powers formerly very active; but here on the Athabaska\r\nI saw daily evidence of these powers in full blast, ripping, tearing\r\nreconstructing, while we looked on.\r\n\r\nAll the way down the river we saw the process of undermining the\r\nbank, tearing down the trees to whirl them again on distant northern\r\nshores, thus widening the river channel until too wide for its normal\r\nflood, which in time, drops into a deeper restricted channel, in\r\nthe wide summer waste of gravel and sand.\r\n\r\nTen thousand landslides take place every spring, contributing\r\ntheir tons of mud to the millions that the river is deporting to\r\nthe broad catch basins called the Athabaska and Great Slave Lakes.\r\n\r\nMany a tree has happened to stand on the very crack that is the\r\nupmost limit of the slide and has in consequence been ripped in\r\ntwo.\r\n\r\nMany an island is wiped out and many a one made in these annual\r\nfloods. Again and again we saw the evidence of some island, continued\r\nlong enough to raise a spruce forest, suddenly receive a 6-foot\r\ncontribution from its erratic mother; so the trees were buried to\r\nthe arm-pits. Many times I saw where some frightful jam of ice had\r\nplaned off all the trees; then a deep overwhelming layer of mud\r\nhad buried the stumps and grown in time a new spruce forest. Now\r\nthe mighty erratic river was tearing all this work away again,\r\nexposing all its history.\r\n\r\nIn the delta of the Slave, near Fort Resolution, we saw the plan of\r\ndelta work. Millions of tons of mud poured into the deep translucent\r\nlake have filled it for miles, so that it is scarcely deep enough\r\nto float a canoe; thousands of huge trees, stolen from the upper\r\nforest, are here stranded as wing-dams that check the current and\r\nhold more mud. Rushes grow on this and catch more mud. Then the\r\nwillows bind it more, and the sawing down of the outlet into the\r\nMackenzie results in all this mud being left dry land.\r\n\r\nThis is the process that has made all the lowlands at the mouth\r\nof Great Slave and Athabaska Rivers. And the lines of tree trunks\r\nto-day, preparing for the next constructive annexation of the lake,\r\nare so regular that one's first thought is that this is the work\r\nof man. But these are things that my sketches and photographs will\r\nshow better than words.\r\n\r\nWhen later we got onto the treeless Barrens or Tundra, the process\r\nwas equally evident, though at this time dormant, and the chief\r\nagent was not running water, but the giant Jack Frost.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIX\r\n\r\nPIKE'S PORTAGE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPart of my plan was to leave a provision cache every hundred\r\nmiles, with enough food to carry us 200 miles, and thus cover the\r\npossibility of considerable loss. I had left supplies at Chipewyan,\r\nSmith, and Resolution, but these were settlements; now we were\r\npushing off into the absolute wilderness, where it was unlikely\r\nwe should see any human beings but ourselves. Now, indeed, we\r\nwere facing all primitive conditions. Other travellers have made\r\nsimilar plans for food stores, but there are three deadly enemies\r\nto a cache--weather, ravens, and wolverines., I was prepared for\r\nall three. Water-proof leatheroid cases were to turn the storm,\r\ndancing tins and lines will scare the ravens, and each cache tree\r\nwas made unclimbable to Wolverines by the addition of a necklace of\r\ncharms in the form of large fish-hooks, all nailed on with points\r\ndownward. This idea, borrowed from, Tyrrell, has always proved a\r\nsuccess; and not one of our caches was touched or injured.\r\n\r\nTyrrell has done much for this region; his name will ever be\r\nlinked with its geography and history. His map of the portage was\r\na godsend, for now we found that our guide had been here only once,\r\nand that when he was a child, with many resultant lapses of memory\r\nand doubts about the trail. My only wonder was that he remembered\r\nas much as he did.\r\n\r\nHere we had a sudden and unexpected onset of black flies; they\r\nappeared for the first time in numbers, and attacked us with a\r\nferocity that made the mosquitoes seem like a lot of baby butterflies\r\nin comparison. However, much as we may dislike the latter, they at\r\nleast do not poison us or convey disease (as yet), and are repelled\r\nby thick clothing. The black flies attack us like some awful\r\npestilence walking in darkness, crawling in and forcing themselves\r\nunder our clothing, stinging and poisoning as they go. They are,\r\nof course, worst near the openings in our armour, that is necks,\r\nwrists, and ankles. Soon each of us had a neck like an old fighting\r\nbull walrus; enormously swollen, corrugated with bloats and wrinkles,\r\nblotched, bumpy, and bloody, as disgusting as it was painful. All\r\ntoo closely it simulated the ravages of some frightful disease, and\r\nfor a night or two the torture of this itching fire kept me from\r\nsleeping. Three days, fortunately, ended the black fly reign,\r\nand left us with a deeper sympathy for the poor Egyptians who on\r\naccount of their own or some other bodies' sins were the victims\r\nof \"plagues of flies.\"\r\n\r\nBut there was something in the camp that amply offset these annoyances;\r\nthis was a spirit of kindness and confidence. Old Weeso was smiling\r\nand happy, ready at all times to do his best; his blundering about\r\nthe way was not surprising, all things considered, but his mistakes\r\ndid not matter, since I had Tyrrell's admirable maps. Billy, sturdy,\r\nstrong, reliable, never needed to be called twice in the morning.\r\nNo matter what the hour, he was up at once and cooking the breakfast\r\nin the best of style, for an A 1 cook he was. And when it came to\r\nthe portages he would shoulder his 200 or 250 pounds each time.\r\nPreble combined the mental force of the educated white man with\r\nthe brawn of the savage, and although not supposed to do it, he\r\ntook the same sort of loads as Billy did. Mine, for the best of\r\nreasons, were small, and consisted chiefly of the guns, cameras,\r\nand breakables, or occasionally, while they were transporting the\r\nheavy stuff, I acted as cook. But all were literally and figuratively\r\nin the same boat, all paddled all day, ate the same food worked\r\nthe same hours, and imbued with the same spirit were eager to reach\r\nthe same far goal. From this on the trip was ideal.\r\n\r\nWe were 3 1/2 days covering the 8 small lakes and 9 portages (30\r\nmiles) that lie between the two great highways, Great Slave Lake\r\nand Artillery Lake; and camped on the shore of the latter on the\r\nnight of July 31.\r\n\r\nTwo of these 9 lakes had not been named by the original explorers.\r\nI therefore exercised my privilege and named them, respectively,\r\n\"Loutit\" and \"Weeso,\" in honour of my men.\r\n\r\nThe country here is cut up on every side with caribou trails; deep\r\nworn like the buffalo trails on the plains, with occasional horns\r\nand bones; these, however, are not so plentiful as were the relics\r\nof the Buffalo. This, it proved, was because the Caribou go far\r\nnorth at horn-dropping time, and they have practically no bones\r\nthat the Wolves cannot crush with their teeth.\r\n\r\nAlthough old tracks were myriad-many, there were no new ones. Weeso\r\nsaid, however, \"In about four days the shores of this lake will\r\nbe alive with Caribou.\" It will show the erratic nature of these\r\nanimals when I say that the old man was all wrong; they did not\r\nappear there in numbers until many weeks later, probably not for\r\ntwo months.\r\n\r\nHere, at the foot of Artillery Lake, we were near the last of the\r\ntimber, and, strange to say, we found some trees of remarkably large\r\ngrowth. One, a tamarac, was the largest and last seen; the other,\r\na spruce--Pike's Lobstick--was 55 inches in girth, 1 foot from the\r\nground.\r\n\r\nAt this camp Weeso complained that he was feeling very sick; had\r\npains in his back. I could not make out what was the matter with\r\nhim, but Billy said sagaciously, \"I think if you give him any kind\r\nof a pill he will be all right. It doesn't matter what, so long as\r\nit's a pill.\"\r\n\r\nOf course \"cathartic\" is good blind play in case of doubt. He got\r\na big, fierce rhubarb, and all went well.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXX\r\n\r\nCARIBOU-LAND AT LAST\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the morning of August 1 we launched on Artillery Lake, feeling,\r\nfor the tenth time, that now we really were on the crowning stretch of\r\nour journey, that at last we were entering the land of the Caribou.\r\n\r\nOver the deep, tranquil waters of the lake we went, scanning the\r\npainted shores with their dwindling remnants of forest. There is\r\nsomething inspiring about the profundity of transparency in these\r\nlakes, where they are 15 feet deep their bottoms are no more\r\nobscured than in an ordinary eastern brook at 6 inches. On looking\r\ndown into the far-below world, one gets the sensation of flight as\r\none skims overhead in the swift canoe. And how swift that elegant\r\ncanoe was in a clear run I was only now finding out. All my\r\nprevious estimates had been too low. Here I had the absolute gauge\r\nof Tyrrell's maps and found that we four paddling could send her,\r\nnot 3 1/2, but 4 1/2 or 5 miles an hour, with a possibility of 6\r\nwhen we made an effort. As we spun along the south-east coast of\r\nthe lake, the country grew less rugged; the continuous steep granite\r\nhills were replaced by lower buttes with long grassy plains between;\r\nand as I took them in, I marvelled at their name--the Barrens; bare\r\nof trees, yes, but the plains were covered with rich, rank grass,\r\nmore like New England meadows. There were stretches where the herbage\r\nwas rank as on the Indiana prairies, and the average pasture of\r\nthe bleaker parts was better than the best of central Wyoming. A\r\ncattleman of the West would think himself made if he could be sure\r\nof such pastures on his range, yet these are the Barren Grounds.\r\n\r\nAt 3 we passed the splendid landmark of Beaver Lodge Mountain. Its\r\nrosy-red granite cliffs contrast wonderfully with its emerald cap\r\nof verdant grass and mosses, that cover it in tropical luxuriance,\r\nand the rippling lake about it was of Mediterranean hues.\r\n\r\nWe covered the last 9 miles in 1 hour and 53 minutes, passed the\r\ndeserted Indian village, and landed at Last Woods by 8.30 P. M.\r\n\r\nThe edge of the timber is the dividing line between the Hudsonian\r\nand the Arctic zones, It is the beginning of the country we had\r\ncome to see; we were now in the land of the Caribou.\r\n\r\nAt this point we were prepared to spend several days, leave a cache,\r\ngather a bundle of choice firewood, then enter on the treeless\r\nplains.\r\n\r\nThat night it stormed; all were tired; there was no reason to bestir\r\nourselves; it was 10 when we arose. Half an hour later Billy came\r\nto my tent and said, \"Mr. Seton, here's some deer.\" I rushed to\r\nthe door, and there, with my own eyes, I saw on a ridge a mile away\r\nfour great, Caribou standing against the sky.\r\n\r\nWe made for a near hill and met Preble returning; he also had seen\r\nthem. From a higher view-point the 4 proved part of a band of 120.\r\n\r\nThen other bands came in view, 16, 61, 3, 200, and so on; each valley\r\nhad a scattering few, all travelling slowly southward or standing\r\nto enjoy the cool breeze that ended the torment of the flies. About\r\n1,000 were in sight. These were my first Caribou, the first fruits\r\nof 3,000 miles of travel.\r\n\r\nWeeso got greatly excited; these were the forerunners of the vast\r\nherd. He said, \"Plenty Caribou now,\" and grinned like a happy child.\r\n\r\nI went in one direction, taking only my camera. At least 20 Caribou\r\ntrotted within 50 feet of me.\r\n\r\nBilly and Weeso took their rifles intent on venison, but the Caribou\r\navoided them and 6 or 8 shots were heard before they got a young\r\nbuck.\r\n\r\nAll that day I revelled in Caribou, no enormous herds but always\r\na few in sight.\r\n\r\nThe next day Weeso and I went to the top ridge eastward. He with\r\nrifle, I with camera. He has a vague idea of the camera's use, but\r\ntold Billy privately that \"the rifle was much better for Caribou.\"\r\nHe could not understand why I should restrain him from blazing away\r\nas long as the ammunition held out. \"Didn't we come to shoot?\" But\r\nhe was amenable to discipline, and did as I wished when he understood.\r\n\r\nNow on the top of that windy ridge I sat with this copper-coloured\r\nchild of the spruce woods, to watch these cattle of the plains.\r\n\r\nThe Caribou is a travelsome beast, always in a hurry, going against\r\nthe wind. When the wind is west, all travel west; when it veers,\r\nthey veer. Now the wind was northerly, and all were going north,\r\nnot walking, not galloping--the Caribou rarely gallops, and then\r\nonly for a moment or two; his fast gait is a steady trot a 10-mile\r\ngait, making with stops about 6 miles an hour. But they are ever\r\non the move; when you see a Caribou that does not move, you know\r\nat once it is not a Caribou; it's a rock.\r\n\r\nWe sat down on the hill at 3. In a few minutes a cow Caribou came\r\ntrotting from the south, caught the wind at 50 yards, and dashed\r\naway.\r\n\r\nIn 5 minutes another, in 20 minutes a young buck, in 20 minutes\r\nmore a big buck, in 10 minutes a great herd of about 500 appeared\r\nin the south. They came along at full trot, lined to pass us on the\r\nsoutheast. At half a mile they struck our scent and all recoiled as\r\nthough we were among them. They scattered in alarm, rushed south\r\nagain, then, gathered in solid body, came on as before, again\r\nto spring back and scatter as they caught the taint of man. After\r\nmuch and various running, scattering, and massing, they once more\r\ncharged the fearsome odour and went right through it. Now they\r\npassed at 500 yards and gave the chance for a far camera shot.\r\n\r\nThe sound of their trampling was heard a long way off--half a\r\nmile--but at 300 yards I could not distinguish the clicking of the\r\nfeet, whereas this clicking was very plainly to be heard from the\r\nband that passed within 50 yards of me in the morning.\r\n\r\nThey snort a good deal and grunt a little, and, notwithstanding\r\ntheir continual haste, I noticed that from time to time one or two\r\nwould lie down, but at once jump up and rush on when they found\r\nthey were being left behind. Many more single deer came that day,\r\nbut no more large herds.\r\n\r\nAbout 4.30 a fawn of this year (2 1/2 or 3 months) came rushing\r\nup from the north, all alone. It charged up a hill for 200 yards,\r\nthen changed its mind and charged down again, then raced to a bunch\r\nof tempting herbage, cropped it hastily, dashed to a knoll, left\r\nat an angle, darted toward us till within 40 yards, then dropped\r\ninto a thick bed of grass, where it lay as though it had unlimited\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nI took one photograph, and as I crawled to get one nearer, a shot\r\npassed over my head, and the merry cackle told me that Weeso had\r\nyielded to temptation and had 'collected' that fawn.\r\n\r\nA young buck now came trotting and grunting toward us till within\r\n16 paces, which proved too much for Weeso, who then and there,\r\nin spite of repeated recent orders, started him on the first step\r\ntoward my museum collection.\r\n\r\nI scolded him angrily, and he looked glum and unhappy, like a naughty\r\nlittle boy caught in some indiscretion which he cannot understand.\r\nHe said nothing to me then, but later complained to Billy, asking,\r\n\"What did we come for?\"\r\n\r\nNext morning at dawn I dreamed I was back in New York and that a\r\ncouple of cats were wailing under my bedroom window. Their noise\r\nincreased so that I awoke, and then I heard unaccountable caterwauls.\r\nThey were very loud and near, at least one of the creatures was. At\r\nlength I got up to see. Here on the lake a few yards from the tent\r\nwas a loon swimming about, minutely inspecting the tent and uttering\r\nat intervals deep cat-like mews in expression of his curiosity.\r\n\r\nThe south wind had blown for some days before we arrived, and the\r\nresult was to fill the country with Caribou coming from the north.\r\nThe day after we came, the north wind set in, and continued for\r\nthree days, so that soon there was not a Caribou to be found in\r\nthe region.\r\n\r\nIn the afternoon I went up the hill to where Weeso left the\r\noffal of his deer. A large yellowish animal was there feeding. It\r\ndisappeared over a rock and I could get no second view of it. It\r\nmay have been a wolf, as I saw a fresh wolf trail near; I did not,\r\nhowever, see the animal's tail.\r\n\r\nIn the evening Preble and I went again, and again the creature was\r\nthere, but disappeared as mysteriously as before when we were 200\r\nyards away. Where it went we could not guess. The country was open\r\nand we scoured it with eye and glass, but saw nothing more of the\r\nprowler. It seemed to be a young Arctic wolf, yellowish white in\r\ncolour, but tailless,\r\n\r\nNext day, at noon Preble and Billy returned bearing the illusive\r\nvisitor; it was a large Lynx. It was very thin and yet, after\r\nbleeding, weighed 22 pounds. But why was it so far from the forest,\r\n20 miles or more, and a couple of miles from this little grove that\r\nformed the last woods?\r\n\r\nThis is another evidence of the straits the Lynxes are put to for\r\nfood, in this year of famine.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXI\r\n\r\nGOOD-BYE TO THE WOODS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe last woods is a wonderfully interesting biological point or\r\nline; this ultimate arm of the forest does not die away gradually\r\nwith uncertain edges and in steadily dwindling trees. The latter\r\nhave sent their stoutest champions to the front, or produced, as\r\nby a final effort, some giants for the line of battle. And that\r\nline, with its sentinels, is so marked that one can stand with\r\na foot on the territory of each combatant, or, as scientists call\r\nthem, the Arctic Region and the cold Temperate.\r\n\r\nAnd each of the embattled kings, Jack-frost and Sombre-pine, has\r\nhis children in abundance to possess the land as he wins it. Right\r\nup to the skirmish line are they.\r\n\r\nThe low thickets of the woods are swarming with Tree-sparrows,\r\nRedpolls, Robins, Hooded Sparrows, and the bare plains, a few\r\nyards away, are peopled and vocal with birds to whom a bush is an\r\nabomination. Lap-longspur, Snowbird, Shorelarks, and Pipits are\r\nhere soaring and singing, or among the barren rocks are Ptarmigan\r\nin garments that are painted in the patterns of their rocks.\r\n\r\nThere is one sombre fowl of ampler wing that knows no line--is at\r\nhome in the open or in the woods. His sonorous voice has a human\r\nsound that is uncanny; his form is visible afar in the desert and\r\nsinister as a gibbet; his plumage fits in with nothing but the\r\nnight, which he does not love. This evil genius of the land is the\r\nRaven of the north. Its numbers increased as we reached the Barrens,\r\nand the morning after the first Caribou was killed, no less than\r\n28 were assembled at its offal.\r\n\r\nAn even more interesting bird of the woods is the Hooded Sparrow,\r\ninteresting because so little known.\r\n\r\nHere I found it on its breeding-grounds, a little late for its\r\nvernal song, but in September we heard its autumnal renewal like\r\nthe notes of its kinsmen, White-throat and White-crowned Sparrows,\r\nbut with less whistling, and more trilled. In all the woods of\r\nthe Hudsonian Zone we found it evidently at home. But here I was\r\nprivileged to find the first nest of the species known to science.\r\nThe victory was robbed of its crown, through the nest having\r\nfledglings instead of eggs, but still it was the ample reward of\r\nhours of search.\r\n\r\nOf course it was on the ground, in the moss and creeping plants,\r\nunder some bushes of dwarf birch, screened by spruces. The structure\r\nclosely resembled that of the Whitethroat was lined with grass\r\nand fibrous roots; no down, feathers, or fur were observable. The\r\nyoung numbered four.\r\n\r\nThe last woods was the limit of other interesting creatures--the\r\nAnts. Wherever one looks on the ground, in a high, dry place,\r\nthroughout the forest country, from Athabaska Landing northward\r\nalong our route, there is to be seen at least one Ant to the square\r\nfoot, usually several. Three kinds seem common--one red-bodied,\r\nanother a black one with brown thorax, and a third very small and\r\nall black. They seem to live chiefly in hollow logs and stumps,\r\nbut are found also on marshes, where their hills are occasionally\r\nso numerous as to form dry bridges across.\r\n\r\nI made many notes on the growth of timber here and all along the\r\nroute; and for comparison will begin at the very beging.\r\n\r\nIn March, 1907, at my home in Connecticut, I cut down an oak tree\r\n(Q. palustris) that was 110 feet high, 32 inches in diameter, and\r\nyet had only 76 rings of annual growth.\r\n\r\nIn the Bitterroot Mountains of Idaho, where I camped in September,\r\n1902, a yellow pine 6 feet 6 inches high was 51 inches in circumference\r\nat base. It had 14 rings and 14 whorls of branches corresponding\r\nexactly with the rings.\r\n\r\nAt the same place I measured a balsam fir--84 feet high, 15 inches\r\nin diameter at 32 inches from the ground. It had 52 annual rings\r\nand 50 or possibly 52 whorls of branches. The most vigorous upward\r\ngrowth of the trunk corresponded exactly with the largest growth\r\nof wood in the stump. Thus ring No. 33 was 3/8 inch wide and whorl\r\nNo. 33 had over 2 feet of growth, below it on the trunk were others\r\nwhich had but 6 inches.\r\n\r\nOn the stump most growth was on north-east side; there it was\r\n9 inches, from pith to bark next on east 8 1/2 inches, on south 8\r\ninches, north 6 1/2 inches, west 6 1/2 inches, least on north-west\r\nside, 6 inches. The most light in this case came from the north-east.\r\nThis was in the land of mighty timber.\r\n\r\nOn Great Slave River, the higher latitude is offset by lower\r\naltitude, and on June 2, 1907, while among the tall white spruce\r\ntrees I measured one of average size--118 feet high, 11 feet 2 inches\r\nin girth a foot from the ground (3 feet 6 1/2 inches in diameter),\r\nand many black poplars nearly as tall were 9 feet in girth.\r\n\r\nBut the stunting effect of the short summer became marked as we\r\nwent northward. At Fort Smith, June 20, I cut down a jackpine that\r\nwas 12 feet high, 1 inch in diameter, with 23 annual rings at the\r\nbottom; 6 feet up it had 12 rings and 20 whorls. In all it appeared\r\nto have 43 whorls, which is puzzling. Of these 20 were in the lower\r\npart. This tree grew in dense shade.\r\n\r\nAt Fort Resolution we left the Canadian region of large timber and\r\nentered the stunted spruce, as noted, and at length on the timber\r\nline we saw the final effort of the forests to combat Jack Frost\r\nin his own kingdom. The individual history of each tree is in three\r\nstages:\r\n\r\nFirst, as a low, thick, creeping bush sometimes ten feet across,\r\nbut only a foot high. In this stage it continues until rooted enough\r\nand with capital enough to send up a long central shoot; which is\r\nstage No. 2.\r\n\r\nThis central shoot is like a Noah's Ark pine; in time it becomes\r\nthe tree and finally the basal thicket dies, leaving the specimen\r\nin stage No. 3.\r\n\r\nA stem of one of the low creepers was cut for examination; it was\r\n11 inches through and 25 years old. Some of these low mats of spruce\r\nhave stems 5 inches through. They must be fully 100 years old.\r\n\r\nA tall, dead, white spruce at the camp was 30 feet high and 11\r\ninches in diameter at 4 feet from the ground. Its 190 rings were\r\nhard to count, they were so thin. The central ones were thickest,\r\nthere being 16 to the inmost inch of radius; on the outside to the\r\nnorth 50 rings made only 1/2 an inch and 86 made one inch.\r\n\r\nNumbers 42 and 43, counting from the outside, were two or three\r\ntimes as thick as those outside of them and much thicker than the\r\nnext within; they must have represented years of unusual summers.\r\nNo. 99 also was of great size. What years these corresponded with\r\none could not guess, as the tree was a long time dead.\r\n\r\nAnother, a dwarf but 8 feet high, was 12 inches through. It had\r\n205 rings plus a 5-inch hollow which we reckoned at about 100 rings\r\nof growth; 64 rings made only 1 3/8 inches; the outmost of the 64\r\nwas 2 inches in from the outside of the wood. Those on the outer\r\ntwo inches were even smaller, so as to be exceedingly difficult to\r\ncount. This tree was at least 300 years old; our estimates varied,\r\naccording to the data, from 300 to 325 years.\r\n\r\nThese, then, are the facts for extremes. In Idaho or Connecticut\r\nit took about 10 years to produce the same amount of timber as took\r\n300 years on the edge of the Arctic Zone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXII\r\n\r\nTHE TREELESS PLAINS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOn August 7 we left Camp Last Woods. Our various specimens, with a\r\nstock of food, were secured, as usual, in a cache high in two trees,\r\nin this case those already used by Tyrrell seven years before, and\r\nguarded by the magic necklace of cod hooks.\r\n\r\nBy noon (in 3 hours) we made fifteen miles, camping far beyond\r\nTwin Buttes. All day long the boat shot through water crowded with\r\ndrowned gnats. These were about 10 to the square inch near shore\r\nand for about twenty yards out, after that 10 to the square foot\r\nfor two hundred or three hundred yards still farther from shore,\r\nand for a quarter mile wide they were 10 to the square yard.\r\n\r\nThis morning the wind turned and blew from the south. At 2 P. M.\r\nwe saw a band of some 60 Caribou travelling southward; these were\r\nthe first seen for two or three days. After this we saw many odd\r\nones, and about 3 o'clock a band of 400 or 500. At night we camped\r\non Casba River, having covered 36 miles in 7 hours and 45 minutes.\r\n\r\nThe place, we had selected for camp proved to be a Caribou crossing.\r\nAs we drew near a dozen of them came from the east and swam across.\r\nA second band of 8 now appeared. We gave chase. They spurted; so\r\ndid we. Our canoe was going over 6 miles an hour, and yet was but\r\nslowly overtaking them. They made the water foam around them. Their\r\nheads, necks, shoulders, backs, rumps, and tails were out. I never\r\nbefore saw land animals move so fast in the water. A fawn in danger\r\nof being left behind reared up on its mother's back and hung on\r\nwith forefeet. The leader was a doe or a young buck, I could not\r\nbe sure which; the last was a big buck. They soon struck bottom\r\nand bounded along on the shore. It was too dark for a picture.\r\n\r\nAs we were turning in for the night 30 Caribou came trotting and\r\nsnorting through the camp. Half of them crossed the water, but the\r\nrest turned back when Billy shouted.\r\n\r\nLater a band of two hundred passed through and around our tents.\r\nIn the morning Billy complained that he could not sleep all night\r\nfor Caribou travelling by his tent and stumbling over the guy ropes.\r\nFrom this time on we were nearly always in sight of Caribou, small\r\nbands or scattering groups; one had the feeling that the whole land\r\nwas like this, on and on and on, unlimited space with unlimited\r\nwild herds.\r\n\r\nA year afterward as I travelled in the fair State of Illinois,\r\nfamous for its cattle, I was struck by the idea that one sees far\r\nmore Caribou in the north than cattle, in Illinois. This State has\r\nabout 56,000 square miles, of land and 3,000,000 cattle; the Arctic\r\nPlains have over 1,000,000 square miles of prairie, which, allowing\r\nfor the fact that I saw the best of the range, would set, the Caribou\r\nnumber at over 30,000,000. There is a, good deal of evidence that\r\nthis is not far from the truth.\r\n\r\nThe reader may recollect the original postulate of my plan. Other\r\ntravellers have gone, relying on the abundant Caribou, yet saw none,\r\nso starved. I relied on no Caribou, I took plenty of groceries,\r\nand because I was independent, the Caribou walked into camp nearly\r\nevery day, and we lived largely on their meat, saving our groceries\r\nfor an emergency, which came in an unexpected form. One morning\r\nwhen we were grown accustomed to this condition I said to Billy:\r\n\r\n\"How is the meat?\"\r\n\r\n\"Nearly gone. We'll need another Caribou about Thursday.\"\r\n\r\n\"You better get one now to be ready Thursday. I do not like it so\r\nsteaming fresh. See, there's a nice little buck on that hillside.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, not him; why he is nearly half a mile off. I'd have to pack\r\nhim in. Let's wait till one comes in camp.\"\r\n\r\nWhich we did, and usually got our meat delivered near the door.'\r\n\r\nCaribou meat fresh, and well prepared, has no superior, and the\r\nideal way of cooking it is of course by roasting.\r\n\r\nFried meat is dried meat,\r\n\r\nBoiled meat is spoiled meat,\r\n\r\nRoast meat is best meat.\r\n\r\nHow was it to be roasted at an open fire without continued vigilance?\r\nBy a very simple contrivance that I invented at the time and now\r\noffer for the use of all campers.\r\n\r\nA wire held the leg; on the top of the wire was a paddle or shingle\r\nof wood; above that, beyond the heat, was a cord.\r\n\r\nThe wind gives the paddle a push; it winds up the cord, which then\r\nunwinds itself. This goes on without fail and without effort, never\r\nstill, and the roast is perfect.\r\n\r\nThus we were living on the fat of many lands and on the choicest\r\nfat of this.\r\n\r\nAnd what a region it is for pasture. At this place it reminds one\r\nof Texas. Open, grassy plains, sparser reaches of sand, long slopes\r\nof mesquite, mesas dotted with cedars and stretches of chapparal\r\nand soapweed. Only, those vegetations here are willow, dwarf birch,\r\ntiny spruce, and ledum, and the country as a whole is far too green\r\nand rich. The emerald verdure of the shore, in not a few places,\r\ncarried me back, to the west coast of Ireland.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIII\r\n\r\nTHE UNKNOWN\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe daily observations of route and landmark I can best leave\r\nfor record on my maps. I had one great complaint against previous\r\nexplorers (except Tyrrell); that is, they left no monuments. Aiming\r\nto give no ground of complaint against us, we made monuments at\r\nall important points. On the, night of August 8 we camped at Cairn\r\nBay on the west side of Casba Lake, so named because of the five\r\nremarkable glacial cairns or conical stone-piles about it. On the\r\ntop of one of these I left a monument, a six-foot pillar of large\r\nstones.\r\n\r\nOn the afternoon of August 9 we passed the important headland that\r\nI have called \"Tyrrell Point.\" Here we jumped off his map into\r\nthe unknown. I had, of course, the small chart drawn by Sir George\r\nBack in 1834, but it was hastily made under great difficulties,\r\nand, with a few exceptions, it seemed impossible to recognize his\r\nlandscape features. Next day I explored the east arm of Clinton-Colden\r\nand discovered the tributary that I have called \"Laurier River,\"\r\nand near its mouth made a cairn enclosing a Caribou antler with\r\ninscription \"E. T. Seton, 10 Aug., 1907.\"\r\n\r\nFuture travellers on this lake will find, as I did, that the\r\nConical Butte in the eastern part is an important landmark. It is\r\na glacial dump about 50 feet above the general level, which again\r\nis 100 feet above the water, visible and recognizable from nearly\r\nall parts of the lake.\r\n\r\nThus we went on day by day, sometimes detained by head or heavy\r\nwinds, but making great progress in the calm, which nearly always\r\ncame in the evening; 30 and 35 miles a day we went, led on and\r\nstimulated by the thirst to see and know. \"I must see what is over\r\nthat ridge,\" \"I must make sure that this is an island,\" or \"Maybe\r\nfrom that lookout I shall see Lake Aylmer, or a band of Caribou,\r\nyes, or even a band of Musk-ox.\" Always there was some reward, and\r\nnearly always it was a surprise.\r\n\r\nFrom time to time we came on Snowbirds with their young broods,\r\nevidently at home. Ptarmigan abounded. Parry's Groundsquirrel\r\nwas found at nearly all points, including the large islands. The\r\nLaplongspur swarmed everywhere; their loud \"chee chups\" were the\r\nfirst sounds to greet us each time we neared the land. And out over\r\nall the lake were Loons, Loons, Loons. Four species abound here;\r\nthey caterwaul and yodel all day and all night, each in its own\r\nparticular speech, From time to time a wild hyena chorus from the\r\ntranquil water in the purple sunset haze suggested, that a pack of\r\ngoblin hounds were chivying a goblin buck, but it turned out always\r\nto be a family of Red-throated Loons, yodelling their inspiring\r\nmarching song.\r\n\r\nOne day when at Gravel Mountain, old Weeso came to camp in evident\r\nfear--\"far off he had seen a man.\" In this country a man must mean\r\nan Eskimo; with them the Indian has a long feud; of them he is in\r\nterror. We never learned the truth; I think he was mistaken.\r\n\r\nOnce or twice the long howl of the White Wolf sounded from the\r\nshore, and every day we saw a few Caribou.\r\n\r\nA great many of the single Caribou were on the small islands. In\r\nsix cases that came under close observation the animal in question\r\nhad a broken leg. A broken leg generally evidences recent inroads\r\nby hunters, but the nearest Indians were 200 miles to the south, and\r\nthe nearest Eskimo 300 miles to the north. There was every reason\r\nto believe that we were the only human beings in that vast region,\r\nand certainly we had broken no legs. Every Caribou fired at (8) had\r\nbeen secured and used. There is only one dangerous large enemy common\r\nin this country; that is the White Wolf. And the more I pondered\r\nit, the more it seemed sure that the Wolves had broken the Caribous'\r\nlegs.\r\n\r\nHow! This is the history of each case: The Caribou is so much swifter\r\nthan the Wolves that the latter have no chance in open chase; they\r\ntherefore adopt the stratagem of a sneaking surround and a drive\r\nover the rocks or a precipice, where the Caribou, if not actually\r\nkilled, is more or less disabled. In some cases only a leg is\r\nbroken, and then the Caribou knows his only chance is to reach the\r\nwater. Here his wonderful powers of swimming make him easily safe,\r\nso much so that the Wolves make no attempt to follow. The crippled\r\ndeer makes for some island sanctuary, where he rests in peace till\r\nhis leg is healed, or it may be, in some cases, till the freezing of\r\nthe lake brings him again into the power of his floe.\r\n\r\nThese six, then, were the cripples in hospital, and I hope our\r\nrespectful behaviour did not inspire them with a dangerously false\r\nnotion of humanity.\r\n\r\nOn the island that I have called Owl-and-Hare, we saw the first\r\nWhite Owl and the first Arctic Hare.\r\n\r\nIn this country when you see a tree, you know perfectly well it is\r\nnot a tree; it's the horns of a Caribou. An unusually large affair\r\nof branches appeared on an island in the channel to Aylmer. I landed,\r\ncamera in hand; the Caribou was lying down in the open, but there\r\nwas a tuft of herbage 30 yards from him, another at 20 yards.\r\nI crawled to the first and made a snapshot, then, flat as a rug,\r\nsneaked my way to the one estimated at 20 yards. The click of the\r\ncamera, alarmed the buck; he rose, tried the wind, then lay down\r\nagain, giving me another chance. Having used all the films, I now\r\nstood up. The Caribou dashed away and by a slight limp showed that\r\nhe was in sanctuary. The 20-yard estimate proved too long; it was\r\nonly 16 yards, which put my picture a little out of focus.\r\n\r\nThere never was a day, and rarely an hour of each day, that we did\r\nnot see several Caribou. And yet I never failed to get a thrill\r\nat each fresh one. \"There's a Caribou,\" one says with perennial\r\nintensity that is evidence of perennial pleasure in the sight.\r\nThere never was one sighted that did not give us a happy sense of\r\nsatisfaction--the thought \"This is what we came for.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIV\r\n\r\nAYLMER LAKE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of my objects was to complete the ambiguous shore line of Aylmer\r\nLake. The first task was to find the lake. So we left the narrows\r\nand pushed on and on, studying the Back map, vainly trying to identify\r\npoints, etc. Once or twice we saw gaps ahead that seemed to open\r\ninto the great inland sea of Aylmer. But each in turn proved a\r\nmere bay.--On August 12 we left the narrows; on the 13th and 14th\r\nwe journeyed westward seeking the open sea. On the morning of the\r\n15th we ran into the final end of the farthest bay we could discover\r\nand camped at the mouth of a large river entering in.\r\n\r\nAs usual, we landed--Preble, Billy, and I--to study topography,\r\nWeeso to get firewood, and curiously enough, there was more firewood\r\nhere than we had seen since leaving Artillery Lake. The reason of\r\nthis appeared later.\r\n\r\nI was utterly puzzled. We had not yet found Aylmer Lake, and had\r\ndiscovered an important river that did not seem to be down on any\r\nmap.\r\n\r\nWe went a mile or two independently and studied the land from all\r\nthe high hills; evidently we had crossed the only great sheet of\r\nwater in the region. About noon, when all had assembled at camp,\r\nI said: \"Preble, why, isn't this Lockhart's River, at the western\r\nextremity of Aylmer Lake?\" The truth was dawning on me.\r\n\r\nHe also had been getting light and slowly replied: \"I have forty-nine\r\nreasons why it is, and none at all why it isn't.\"\r\n\r\nThere could be no doubt of it now. The great open sea of Aylmer was\r\na myth. Back never saw it; he passed in a fog, and put down with a\r\nquery the vague information given him by the Indians. This little\r\nirregular lake, much like Clinton-Colden, was Aylmer. We had covered\r\nits length and were now at its farthest western end, at the mouth\r\nof Lockhart's River.\r\n\r\nHow I did wish that explorers would post up the names of the\r\nstreets; it is almost as bad as in New York City. What a lot of\r\ntime we might have saved had we known that Sandy Bay was in Back's\r\nthree-fingered peninsula! Resolving to set a good example I left a\r\nmonument at the mouth of the river. The kind of stone made it easy\r\nto form a cross on top. This will protect it from wandering Indians;\r\nI do not know of anything that will protect it from wandering white\r\nmen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXV\r\n\r\nTHE MUSK-OX\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the afternoon, Preble, Billy, and I went northward on foot to\r\nlook for Musk-ox. A couple of miles from camp I left the others\r\nand went more westerly.\r\n\r\nAfter wandering on for an hour, disturbing Longspurs, Snowbirds,\r\nPipits, Groundsquirrel, and Caribou, I came on a creature that gave\r\nme new thrills of pleasure. It was only a Polar Hare, the second we\r\nhad seen; but its very scarceness here, at least this year, gave\r\nit unusual interest, and the Hare itself helped the feeling by\r\nletting me get near it to study, sketch, and photograph.\r\n\r\nIt was exactly like a Prairie Hare in all its manners, even to the\r\nmethod of holding its tail in running, and this is one of the most\r\nmarked and distinctive peculiarities of the different kinds.\r\n\r\nOn the 16th of August we left Lockhart's River, knowing now that\r\nthe north arm of the lake was our way. We passed a narrow bay out\r\nof which there seemed to be a current, then, on the next high land,\r\nnoted a large brown spot that moved rather quickly along. It was\r\nundoubtedly some animal with short legs, whether a Wolverine a\r\nmile away, or a Musk-ox two miles away, was doubtful. Now did that\r\ncanoe put on its six-mile gait, and we soon knew for certain\r\nthat the brown thing was a Musk-ox. We were not yet in their country,\r\nbut here was one of them to meet us. Quickly we landed. Guns and\r\ncameras were loaded.\r\n\r\n\"Don't fire till I get some pictures--unless he charges,\" were the\r\norders. And then we raced after the great creature grazing from\r\nus.\r\n\r\nWe had no idea whether he would run away or charge, but knew that\r\nour plan was to remain unseen as long as possible. So, hiding behind\r\nrocks when he looked around, and dashing forward when he grazed,\r\nwe came unseen within two hundred yards, and had a good look at\r\nthe huge woolly ox. He looked very much like an ordinary Buffalo,\r\nthe same in colour, size, and action. I never was more astray in\r\nmy preconcept of any animal, for I had expected to see something\r\nlike a large brown sheep.\r\n\r\nMy, first film was fired. Then, for some unknown reason, that\r\nMusk-ox took it into his head to travel fast away from us, not\r\neven stopping to graze; he would soon have been over a rocky ridge.\r\nI nodded to Preble. His rifle rang; the bull wheeled sharp about\r\nwith an angry snort and came toward us. His head was up, his eye\r\nblazing, and he looked like a South African Buffalo and a Prairie\r\nBison combined, and seemed to get bigger at every moment. We were\r\nsafely hidden behind rocks, some fifty yards from him now, when I\r\ngot my second snap.\r\n\r\nRealising the occasion, and knowing my men, I said: \"Now, Preble, I\r\nam going to walk up to that bull and get a close picture. He will\r\ncertainly charge me, as I shall be nearest and in full view. There\r\nis only one combination that can save my life: that is you and that\r\nrifle.\"\r\n\r\nThen with characteristic loquacity did Preble reply: \"Go ahead.\"\r\n\r\nI fixed my camera for twenty yards and quit the sheltering rock.\r\nThe bull snorted, shook his head, took aim, and just before the\r\nprecious moment was to arrive a heavy shot behind me, rang out, the\r\nbull staggered and fell, shot through the heart, and Weeso cackled\r\naloud in triumph.\r\n\r\nHow I cursed the meddling old fool. He had not understood. He\r\nsaw, as he supposed, \"the Okimow in peril of his life,\" and acted\r\naccording to the dictates of his accursedly poor discretion. Never\r\nagain shall he carry a rifle with me.\r\n\r\nSo the last scene came not, but we had the trophy of a Musk-ox\r\nthat weighed nine hundred pounds in life and stood five feet high\r\nat the shoulders--a world's record in point of size.\r\n\r\nNow we must camp perforce to save the specimen. Measurements, photos,\r\nsketches, and weights were needed, then the skinning and preparing\r\nwould be a heavy task for all. In the many portages afterwards the\r\nskull was part of my burden; its weight was actually forty pounds,\r\nits heaviness was far over a hundred.\r\n\r\nWhat extraordinary luck we were having. It was impossible in our\r\ntime limit to reach the summer haunt of the Caribou on the Arctic\r\nCoast, therefore the Caribou came to us in their winter haunt on\r\nthe Artillery Lake. We did not expect to reach the real Musk-ox\r\ncountry on the Lower Back River, so the Musk-ox sought us out on\r\nAylmer Lake. And yet one more piece of luck is to be recorded. That\r\nnight something came in our tent and stole meat. The next night\r\nBilly set a trap and secured the thief--an Arctic Fox in summer\r\ncoat. We could not expect to go to him in his summer home, so he\r\ncame to us.\r\n\r\nWhile the boys were finishing the dressing of the bull's hide, I,\r\nremembering the current from the last bay, set out on foot over the\r\nland to learn the reason. A couple of miles brought me to a ridge\r\nfrom which I made the most important geographical discovery of the\r\njourney. Stretching away before me to the far dim north-west was\r\na great, splendid river--broad, two hundred yards wide in places,\r\nbut averaging seventy or eighty yards across--broken by white\r\nrapids and waterfalls, but blue deep in the smoother stretches and\r\nemptying into the bay we had noticed. So far as the record showed,\r\nI surely was the first white man to behold it. I went to the margin;\r\nit was stocked with large trout. I followed it up a couple of miles\r\nand was filled with the delight of discovery. \"Earl Grey River\"',\r\nI have been privileged to name it after the distinguished statesman,\r\nnow Governor-general of Canada.\r\n\r\nThen and there I built a cairn, with a record of my visit, and\r\nsitting on a hill with the new river below me, I felt that there\r\nwas no longer any question of the expedition's success. The entire\r\nprogramme was carried out. I had proved the existence of abundance\r\nof Caribou, had explored Aylmer Lake, had discovered two great\r\nrivers, and, finally, had reached the land of the Musk-ox and secured\r\na record-breaker to bring away. This I felt was the supreme moment\r\nof the journey.\r\n\r\nRealizing the farness of my camp, from human abode--it could scarcely\r\nhave been farther on the continent--my thoughts flew back to the\r\ndear ones at home, and my comrades, the men of the Camp-fire Club.\r\nI wondered if their thoughts were with me at the time. How they must\r\nenvy me the chance of launching into the truly unknown wilderness,\r\na land still marked on the maps as \"unexplored!\" How I enjoyed the\r\nthoughts of their sympathy over our probable perils and hardships,\r\nand imagined them crowding around me with hearty greetings on my\r\nsafe return! Alas! for the rush of a great city's life and crowds,\r\nI found out later that these, my companions, did not even know that\r\nI had been away from New York.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVI\r\n\r\nTHE ARCTIC PRAIRIES AND MY FARTHEST NORTH\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCamp Musk-Ox provided many other items of interest besides the Great\r\nRiver, the big Musk-ox, and the Arctic Fox. Here Preble secured a\r\nGroundsquirrel with its cheek-pouches full of mushrooms and shot\r\na cock Ptarmigan whose crop was crammed with leaves of willow and\r\nbirch, though the ground was bright with berries of many kinds. The\r\nlast evening we were there a White Wolf followed Billy into camp,\r\nkeeping just beyond reach of his shotgun; and, of course, we saw\r\nCaribou every hour or two.\r\n\r\n\"All aboard,\" was the cry on the morning of August 19, and once\r\nmore we set out. We reached the north arm of the lake, then turned\r\nnorth-eastward. In the evening I got photos of a Polar Hare, the\r\nthird we had seen. The following day (August 20), at noon, we camped\r\nin Sandhill Bay, the north point of Aylmer Lake and the northernmost\r\npoint of our travels by canoe. It seems that we were the fourth\r\nparty of white men to camp on this spot.\r\n\r\n\r\nCaptain George Back, 1833-34.\r\nStewart and Anderson, 1855.\r\nWarburton Pike, 1890.\r\nE. T. Seton, 1907.\r\n\r\n\r\nAll day long we had seen small bands of Caribou. A score now appeared\r\non a sandhill half a mile away; another and another lone specimen\r\ntrotted past our camp. One of these stopped and gave us an\r\nextraordinary exhibition of agility in a sort of St. Vitus's jig,\r\njumping, kicking, and shaking its head; I suspect the nose-worms\r\nwere annoying it. While we lunched, a fawn came and gazed curiously\r\nfrom a distance of 100 yards. In the after-noon Preble returned\r\nfrom a walk to say that the Caribou were visible in all directions,\r\nbut not in great bands.\r\n\r\nNext morning I was awakened by a Caribou clattering through camp\r\nwithin 30 feet of my tent.\r\n\r\nAfter breakfast we set off on foot northward to seek for Musk-ox,\r\nkeeping to the eastward of the Great Fish River. The country is\r\nrolling, with occasional rocky ridges and long, level meadows in the\r\nlowlands, practically all of it would be considered horse country;\r\nand nearly every meadow had two or three grazing Caribou.\r\n\r\nAbout noon, when six or seven miles north of Aylmer, we halted\r\nfor rest and lunch on the top of the long ridge of glacial dump\r\nthat lies to the east of Great Fish River. And now we had a most\r\ncomplete and spectacular view of the immense open country that we\r\nhad come so far to see. It was spread before us like a huge, minute,\r\nand wonderful chart, and plainly marked with the processes of its\r\nshaping-time.\r\n\r\nImagine a region of low archaean hills, extending one thousand\r\nmiles each way, subjected for thousands of years to a continual\r\nsuccession of glaciers, crushing, grinding, planing, smoothing,\r\nripping up and smoothing again, carrying off whole ranges of broken\r\nhills, in fragments, to dump them at some other point, grind them\r\nagain while there, and then push and hustle them out of that region\r\ninto some other a few hundred miles farther; there again to tumble\r\nand grind them together, pack them into the hollows, and dump them\r\nin pyramidal piles on plains and uplands. Imagine this going on\r\nfor thousands of years, and we shall have the hills lowered and\r\npolished, the valleys more or less filled with broken rocks.\r\n\r\nNow the glacial action is succeeded by a time of flood. For another\r\nage all is below water, dammed by the northern ice, and icebergs\r\nbreaking from the parent sheet carry bedded in them countless\r\nboulders, with which they go travelling south on the open waters.\r\nAs they melt the boulders are dropped; hill and hollow share equally\r\nin this age-long shower of erratics. Nor does it cease till the\r\nprogress of the warmer day removes the northern ice-dam, sets free\r\nthe flood, and the region of archaean rocks stands bare and dry.\r\n\r\nIt must have been a dreary spectacle at that time, low, bare hills\r\nof gneiss, granite, etc.; low valleys half-filled with broken rock\r\nand over everything a sprinkling of erratic boulders; no living thing\r\nin sight, nothing green, nothing growing, nothing but evidence of\r\nmighty power used only to destroy. A waste of shattered granite\r\nspotted with hundreds of lakes, thousands of lakelets, millions of\r\nponds that are marvellously blue, clear, and lifeless.\r\n\r\nBut a new force is born on the scene; it attacks not this hill or\r\nrock, or that loose stone, but on every point of every stone and\r\nrock in the vast domain, it appears--the lowest form of lichen,\r\na mere stain of gray. This spreads and by its own corrosive power\r\neats foothold on the granite; it fructifies in little black velvet\r\nspots. Then one of lilac flecks the pink tones of the granite,\r\nto help the effect. Soon another kind follows--a pale olive-green\r\nlichen that fruits in bumps of rich brown velvet; then another\r\nbranching like a tiny tree--there is a ghostly kind like white\r\nchalk rubbed lightly on, and yet another of small green blots, and\r\none like a sprinkling of scarlet snow; each, in turn, of a higher\r\nand larger type, which in due time prepares the way for mosses\r\nhigher still.\r\n\r\nIn the less exposed places these come forth, seeking the shade,\r\nsearching for moisture, they form like small sponges on a coral\r\nreef; but growing, spread and change to meet the changing contours\r\nof the land they win, and with every victory or upward move, adopt\r\nsome new refined intensive tint that is the outward and visible\r\nsign of their diverse inner excellences and their triumph. Ever\r\nevolving they spread, until there are great living rugs of strange\r\ntextures and oriental tones; broad carpets there are of gray and\r\ngreen; long luxurious lanes, with lilac mufflers under foot, great\r\nbeds of a moss so yellow chrome, so spangled with intense red sprigs,\r\nthat they might, in clumsy hands, look raw. There are knee-deep\r\nbreadths of polytrichum, which blends in the denser shade into a\r\nmoss of delicate crimson plush that baffles description.\r\n\r\nDown between the broader masses are bronze-green growths that run\r\nover each slight dip and follow down the rock crannies like streams\r\nof molten brass. Thus the whole land is overlaid with a living,\r\ncorrosive mantle of activities as varied as its hues.\r\n\r\nFor ages these toil on, improving themselves, and improving the\r\ncountry by filing down the granite and strewing the dust around\r\neach rock.\r\n\r\nThe frost, too, is at work, breaking up the granite lumps; on every\r\nridge there is evidence of that--low, rounded piles of stone which\r\nplainly are the remnants of a boulder, shattered by the cold. Thus,\r\nlichen, moss, and frost are toiling to grind the granite surfaces\r\nto dust.\r\n\r\nMuch of this powdered rock is washed by rain into the lakes and\r\nponds; in time these cut their exits down, and drain, leaving each\r\na broad mud-flat. The climate mildens and the south winds cease\r\nnot, so that wind-borne grasses soon make green meadows of the\r\nbroad lake-bottom flats.\r\n\r\nThe process climbs the hill-slopes; every little earthy foothold\r\nfor a plant is claimed by some new settler, until each low hill is\r\ncovered to the top with vegetation graded to its soil, and where\r\nthe flowering kinds cannot establish themselves, the lichen pioneers\r\nstill maintain their hold. Rarely, in the landscape, now, is any of\r\nthe primitive colour of the rocks; even the tall, straight cliffs\r\nof Aylmer are painted and frescoed with lichens that flame and\r\nglitter with purple and orange, silver and gold. How precious and\r\nfertile the ground is made to seem, when every square foot of it\r\nis an exquisite elfin garden made by the little people, at infinite\r\ncost, filled with dainty flowers and still later embellished with\r\ndelicate fruit.\r\n\r\nOne of the wonderful things about these children of the Barrens\r\nis the great size of fruit and flower compared with the plant. The\r\ncranberry, the crowberry, the cloudberry, etc., produce fruit any\r\none of which might outweigh the herb itself.\r\n\r\nNowhere does one get the impression that these are weeds, as often\r\nhappens among the rank growths farther south. The flowers in the\r\nwildest profusion are generally low, always delicate and mostly\r\nin beds of a single species. The Lalique jewelry was the sensation\r\nof the Paris Exposition of 1899. Yet here is Lalique renewed and\r\nchanged for every week in the season and lavished on every square\r\nfoot of a region that is a million square miles in extent.\r\n\r\nNot a cranny in a rock but is seized on at once by the eager little\r\ngardeners in charge and made a bed of bloom, as though every inch\r\nof room were priceless. And yet Nature here exemplifies the law\r\nthat our human gardeners are only learning: \"Mass your bloom, to\r\ngain effect.\"\r\n\r\nAs I stood on that hill, the foreground was a broad stretch of old\r\ngold--the shining sandy yellow of drying grass--but it was patched\r\nwith large scarlet mats of arctous that would put red maple to its\r\nreddest blush. There was no Highland heather here, but there were\r\nwhole hillsides of purple red vaccinium, whose leaves were but a\r\nshade less red than its luscious grape-hued fruit.\r\n\r\nHere were white ledums in roods and acre beds; purple mairanias\r\nby the hundred acres, and, framed in lilac rocks, were rich, rank\r\nmeadows of golden-green by the mile.\r\n\r\nThere were leagues and leagues of caribou moss, pale green or lilac,\r\nand a hundred others in clumps, that, seeing here the glory of the\r\npainted mosses, were simulating their ways, though they themselves\r\nwere the not truly mosses at all.\r\n\r\nI never before saw such a realm of exquisite flowers so exquisitely\r\ndisplayed, and the effect at every turn throughout the land was\r\ncolour, colour, colour, to as far outdo the finest autumn tints of\r\nNew England as the Colorado Canyon outdoes the Hoosac Gorge. What\r\nNature can do only in October, elsewhere, she does here all season\r\nthrough, as though when she set out to paint the world she began\r\non the Barrens with a full palette and when she reached the Tropics\r\nhad nothing left but green.\r\n\r\nThus at every step one is wading through lush grass or crushing\r\nprairie blossoms and fruits. It is so on and on; in every part of\r\nthe scene, there are but few square feet that do not bloom with\r\nflowers and throb with life; yet this is the region called the\r\nBarren Lands of the North.\r\n\r\nAnd the colour is an index of its higher living forms, for this\r\nis the chosen home of the Swans and Wild Geese; many of the Ducks,\r\nthe Ptarmigan, the Laplongspur and Snowbunting. The blue lakes echo\r\nwith the wailing of the Gulls and the eerie magic calling of the\r\nLoons. Colonies of Lemmings, Voles, or Groundsquirrels are found\r\non every sunny slope; the Wolverine and the White Wolf find this\r\na land of plenty, for on every side, as I stood on that high hill,\r\nwere to be seen small groups of Caribou.\r\n\r\nThis was the land and these the creatures I had come to see. This\r\nwas my Farthest North and this was the culmination of years of\r\ndreaming. How very good it seemed at the time, but how different\r\nand how infinitely more delicate and satisfying was the realisation\r\nthan any of the day-dreams founded on my vision through the eyes\r\nof other men.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVII\r\n\r\nFACING HOMEWARD\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOn this hill we divided, Preble and Billy going northward; Weeso\r\nand I eastward, all intent on finding a herd of Musk-ox; for this\r\nwas the beginning of their range. There was one continual surprise\r\nas we journeyed--the willows that were mere twigs on Aylmer Lake\r\nincreased in size and were now plentiful and as high as our heads,\r\nwith stems two or three inches thick. This was due partly to the\r\ndecreased altitude and partly to removal from the broad, cold sheet\r\nof Aylmer, which, with its July ice, must tend to lower the summer\r\ntemperature.\r\n\r\nFor a long time we tramped eastward, among hills and meadows, with\r\nCaribou. Then, at length, turned south again and, after a 20-mile\r\ntramp, arrived in camp at 6.35, having seen no sign whatever of\r\nMusk-ox, although this is the region where Pike found them common;\r\non July 1, 1890, at the little lake where we lunched, his party\r\nkilled seven out of a considerable band.\r\n\r\nAt 9.30 that night Preble and Billy returned. They had been over Icy\r\nRiver, easily recognised by the thick ice still on its expansions,\r\nand on to Musk-ox Lake, without seeing any fresh tracks of a Musk-ox.\r\nAs they came into camp a White Wolf sneaked away.\r\n\r\nRain began at 6 and continued a heavy storm all night. In the morning\r\nit was still in full blast, so no one rose until 9.30, when Billy,\r\nstarved out of his warm bed, got up to make breakfast. Soon I\r\nheard him calling: \"Mr. Seton, here's a big Wolf in camp!\" \"Bring\r\nhim in here,\" I said. Then a rifle-shot was heard, another, and\r\nBilly appeared, dragging a huge White Wolf. (He is now to be seen\r\nin the American Museum.)\r\n\r\nAll that day and the next night the storm raged. Even the presence\r\nof Caribou bands did not stimulate us enough to face the sleet.\r\nNext day it was dry, but too windy to travel.\r\n\r\nBilly now did something that illustrates at once the preciousness\r\nof firewood, and the pluck, strength, and reliability of my cook.\r\nDuring his recent tramp he found a low, rocky hollow full of large,\r\ndead willows. It was eight miles back; nevertheless he set out,\r\nof his own free will; tramped the eight miles, that wet, blustery\r\nday, and returned in five and one-half hours, bearing on his back\r\na heavy load, over 100 pounds of most acceptable firewood. Sixteen\r\nmiles afoot for a load of wood! But it seemed well worth it as we\r\nrevelled in the blessed blaze.\r\n\r\nNext day two interesting observations were made; down by the shore\r\nI found the midden-heap of a Lemming family. It contained about\r\nfour hundred pellets: their colour and dryness, with the absence\r\nof grass, showed that they dated from winter.\r\n\r\nIn the evening the four of us witnessed the tragic end of a\r\nLap-longspur. Pursued by a fierce Skua Gull, it unfortunately dashed\r\nout over the lake. In vain then it darted up and down, here and\r\nthere, high and low; the Skua followed even more quickly. A second\r\nSkua came flying to help, but was not needed. With a falcon-like\r\nswoop, the pirate seized the Longspur in his bill and bore it away\r\nto be devoured at the nearest perch.\r\n\r\nAt 7.30 A. M., August 24, 1907, surrounded by scattering Caribou,\r\nwe pushed off from our camp at Sand Hill Bay and began the return\r\njourney.\r\n\r\nAt Wolf-den Point we discovered a large and ancient wolf-den in the\r\nrocks; also abundance of winter sign of Musk-ox. That day we made\r\nforty miles and camped for the night on the Sand Hill Mountain in\r\nTha-na-koie, the channel that joins Aylmer and Clinton-Colden. Here\r\nwe were detained by high winds until the 28th.\r\n\r\nThis island is a favourite Caribou crossing, and Billy and Weeso\r\nhad pitched their tents right on the place selected by the Caribou\r\nfor their highway. Next day, while scanning the country from the\r\ntop of the mount, I saw three Caribou trotting along. They swam the\r\nriver and came toward me. As Billy and Weeso were in their tents\r\nhaving an afternoon nap, I thought it would be a good joke to stampede\r\nthe Caribou on top of them, so waited behind a rock, intending to\r\njump out as soon as they were past me. They followed the main trail\r\nat a trot, and I leaped out with \"horrid yells\" when they passed\r\nmy rock, but now the unexpected happened. \"In case of doubt take\r\nto the water\" is Caribou wisdom, so, instead of dashing madly into\r\nthe tents, they made three desperate down leaps and plunged into\r\nthe deep water, then calmly swam for the other shore, a quarter\r\nof a mile away.\r\n\r\nThis island proved a good place for small mammals. Here Preble\r\ngot our first specimen of the White Lemming. Large islands usually\r\nprove better for small mammals than the mainland. They have the\r\nsame conditions to support life, but being moated by the water are\r\nusually without the larger predatory quadrupeds.\r\n\r\nThe great central inland of Clinton-Colden proved the best place\r\nof all for Groundsquirrels. Here we actually found them in colonies.\r\n\r\nOn the 29th and 30th we paddled and surveyed without ceasing and\r\ncamped beyond the rapid at the exit of Clinton-Colden. The next\r\nafternoon we made the exit rapids of Casba Lake. Preble was preparing\r\nto portage them, but asked Weeso, \"Can we run them?\"\r\n\r\nWeeso landed, walked to a view-point, took a squinting look and\r\nsaid, \"Ugh!\" (Yes). Preble rejoined, \"All right! If he says he can,\r\nhe surely can. That's the Indian of it. A white man takes risks;\r\nan Indian will not; if it is risky he'll go around.\" So we ran the\r\nrapids in safety.\r\n\r\nLighter each day, as the food was consumed, our elegant canoe went\r\nfaster. When not detained by heavy seas 30 or 40 miles a day was\r\nour journey. On August 30 we made our last 6 miles in one hour and\r\n6 1/2 minutes. On September 2, in spite of head-winds, we made 36\r\nmiles in 8 1/4 hours and in the evening we skimmed over the glassy\r\nsurface of Artillery Lake, among its many beautiful islands and\r\nonce more landed at our old ground--the camp in the Last Woods.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVIII\r\n\r\nTHE FIRST WOODS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHow shall I set forth the feelings it stirred? None but the shipwrecked\r\nsailor, long drifting on the open sea, but come at last to land,\r\ncan fully know the thrill it gave us. We were like starving Indians\r\nsuddenly surrounded by Caribou. Wood--timber--fuel--galore! It was\r\nhard to realise--but there it was, all about us, and in the morning\r\nwe were awakened by the sweet, sweet, home-like song of the Robins\r\nin the trees, singing their \"Cheerup, cheerily,\" just as they do\r\nit in Ontario and Connecticut. Our cache was all right; so, our\r\nstock of luxuries was replenished. We now had unlimited food as well\r\nas unlimited firewood; what more could any one ask? Yet there was\r\nmore. The weather was lovely; perfect summer days, and the mosquitoes\r\nwere gone, yes, now actually nets and flybars were discarded for\r\ngood. On every side was animal life in abundance; the shimmering\r\nlake with its Loons and islands would fit exactly the Indian's dream\r\nof the heavenly hunting-grounds. These were the happy halcyon days\r\nof the trip, and we stayed a week to rest and revel in the joys\r\nabout us.\r\n\r\nIn the morning I took a long walk over the familiar hills; the\r\nvarious skeletons we had left were picked bare, evidently by Gulls\r\nand Ravens, as no bones were broken and even the sinews were left.\r\nThere were many fresh tracks of single Caribou going here and\r\nthere, but no trails of large bands. I sent Weeso off to the Indian\r\nvillage, two miles south. He returned to say that it was deserted\r\nand that, therefore, the folk had gone after the Caribou, which\r\ndoubtless were now in the woods south of Artillery Lake. Again the\r\nold man was wholly astray in his Caribou forecast.\r\n\r\nThat night there was a sharp frost; the first we had had. It\r\nmade nearly half an inch of ice in all kettles. Why is ice always\r\nthickest on the kettles? No doubt because they hold a small body\r\nof very still water surrounded by highly conductive metal.\r\n\r\nBilly went \"to market\" yesterday, killing a nice, fat little Caribou.\r\nThis morning on returning to bring in the rest of the meat we found\r\nthat a Wolverine had been there and lugged the most of it away.\r\nThe tracks show that it was an old one accompanied by one or maybe\r\ntwo young ones. We followed them some distance but lost all trace\r\nin a long range of rocks.\r\n\r\nThe Wolverine is one of the typical animals of the far North. It\r\nhas an unenviable reputation for being the greatest plague that\r\nthe hunter knows. Its habit of following to destroy all traps for\r\nthe sake of the bait is the prime cause of man's hatred, and its\r\ncleverness in eluding his efforts at retaliation give it still more\r\nimportance.\r\n\r\nIt is, above all, the dreaded enemy of a cache, and as already\r\nseen, we took the extra precaution of putting our caches up trees\r\nthat were protected by a necklace of fishhooks. Most Northern\r\ntravellers have regaled us with tales of this animal's diabolical\r\ncleverness and wickedness. It is fair to say that the malice, at\r\nleast, is not proven; and there is a good side to Wolverine character\r\nthat should be emphasized; that is, its nearly ideal family life,\r\ncoupled with the heroic bravery of the mother. I say \"nearly\" ideal,\r\nfor so far as I can learn, the father does not assist in rearing\r\nthe young. But all observers agree that the mother is absolutely\r\nfearless and devoted. More than one of the hunters have assured me\r\nthat it is safer to molest a mother Bear than a mother Wolverine\r\nwhen accompanied by the cubs.\r\n\r\nBellalise, a half-breed of Chipewyan, told me that twice he had\r\nfound Wolverine dens, and been seriously endangered by the mother.\r\nThe first was in mid-May, 1904, near Fond du Lac, north side of\r\nLake Athabaska. He went out with an Indian to bring in a skiff left\r\nsome miles off on the shore. He had no gun, and was surprised by\r\ncoming on an old Wolverine in a slight hollow under the boughs of\r\na green spruce. She rushed at him, showing all her teeth, her eyes\r\nshining blue, and uttering sounds like those of a Bear. The Indian\r\nboy hit her once with a stick, then swung himself out of danger up\r\na tree. Bellalise ran off after getting sight of the young ones;\r\nthey were four in number, about the size of a Muskrat, and pure\r\nwhite. Their eyes were open. The nest was just such as a dog might\r\nmake, only six inches deep and lined with a little dry grass.\r\nScattered around were bones and fur, chiefly of Rabbits.\r\n\r\nThe second occasion was in 1905, within three miles of Chipewyan,\r\nand, as before, about the middle of May. The nest was much like\r\nthe first one; the mother saw him coming, and charged furiously,\r\nuttering a sort of coughing. He shot her dead; then captured the\r\nyoung and examined the nest; there were three young this time. They\r\nwere white like the others.\r\n\r\nNot far from this camp, we found a remarkable midden-yard of Lemmings.\r\nIt was about 10 feet by 40 feet, the ground within the limits was\r\nthickly strewn with pellets, at the rate of 14 to the square inch,\r\nbut nowhere were they piled up. At this reckoning, there were over\r\n800,000, but there were also many outside, which probably raised\r\nthe number to 1,000,000. Each pellet was long, brown, dry, and\r\ncurved, i.e., the winter type. The place, a high, dry, very sheltered\r\nhollow, was evidently the winter range of a colony of Lemmings that\r\nin summer went elsewhere, I suppose to lower, damper grounds.\r\n\r\nAfter sunset, September 5, a bunch of three or four Caribou trotted\r\npast the tents between us and the Lake, 200 yards from us; Billy\r\nwent after them, as, thanks to the Wolverine, we were out of meat,\r\nand at one shot secured a fine young buck.\r\n\r\nHis last winter's coat was all shed now, his ears were turning\r\nwhite and the white areas were expanding on feet and buttocks; his\r\nbelly was pure white.\r\n\r\nOn his back and rump, chiefly the latter, were the scars of 121\r\nbots. I could not see that they affected the skin or, hair in the\r\nleast.\r\n\r\nAlthough all of these Caribou seem to have the normal foot-click,\r\nPreble and I worked in vain with the feet of this, dead one to make\r\nthe sound; we could not by any combination of movement, or weight\r\nor simulation of natural conditions, produce anything like a \"click.\"\r\n\r\nThat same day, as we sat on a hill, a cow Caribou came curiously\r\ntoward us. At 100 yards she circled slowly, gazing till she got\r\nthe wind 150 yards to one side, then up went her tail and off she\r\ntrotted a quarter of a mile, but again drew nearer, then circled\r\nas before till a second time the wind warned her to flee. This she\r\ndid three or four times before trotting away; the habit is often\r\nseen.\r\n\r\nNext afternoon, Billy and I saw a very large buck; his neck was\r\nmuch swollen, his beard flowing and nearly white. He sighted us\r\nafar, and worked north-west away from us, in no great alarm. I got\r\nout of sight, ran a mile and a half, headed him off, then came on\r\nhim from the north, but in spite of all I could do by running and\r\nyelling, he and his band (3 cows with 3 calves) rushed galloping\r\nbetween me and the lake, 75 yards away. He was too foxy to be driven\r\nback into that suspicious neighbourhood.\r\n\r\nThus we had fine opportunities for studying wild life. In all\r\nthese days there was only one unfulfilled desire: I had not seen\r\nthe great herd of Caribou returning to the woods that are their\r\nwinter range.\r\n\r\nThis herd is said to rival in numbers the Buffalo herds of story,\r\nto reach farther than the eye can see, and to be days in passing\r\na given point; but it is utterly erratic. It might arrive in early\r\nSeptember. It was not sure to arrive until late October, when the\r\nwinter had begun. This year all the indications were that it would\r\nbe late. If we were to wait for it, it would mean going out on the\r\nice. For this we were wholly unprepared. There were no means of\r\ngetting the necessary dogs, sleds, and fur garments; my business\r\nwas calling me back to the East. It was useless to discuss the\r\nmatter, decision was forced on me. Therefore, without having seen\r\nthat great sight, one of the world's tremendous zoological spectacles\r\nthe march in one body of millions of Caribou--I reluctantly gave\r\nthe order to start. On September 8 we launched the Ann Seton on\r\nher homeward voyage of 1,200 upstream miles.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIX\r\n\r\nFAREWELL TO THE CARIBOU\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAll along the shore of Artillery Lake we saw small groups of Caribou.\r\nThey were now in fine coat; the manes on the males were long and\r\nwhite and we saw two with cleaned antlers; in one these were of a\r\nbrilliant red, which I suppose meant that they were cleaned that\r\nday and still bloody.\r\n\r\nWe arrived at the south end of Artillery Lake that night, and were\r\nnow again in the continuous woods what spindly little stuff it\r\nlooked when we left it; what superb forest it looked now--and here\r\nwe bade good-bye to the prairies and their Caribou.\r\n\r\nNow, therefore, I shall briefly summarise the information I gained\r\nabout this notable creature. The species ranges over all the\r\ntreeless plains and islands of Arctic America. While the great body\r\nis migratory, there are scattered individuals in all parts at all\r\nseasons. The main body winters in the sheltered southern third of\r\nthe range, to avoid the storms, and moves north in the late spring,\r\nto avoid the plagues of deer-flies and mosquitoes. The former\r\nare found chiefly in the woods, the latter are bad everywhere; by\r\ntravelling against the wind a certain measure of relief is secured,\r\nnortherly winds prevail, so the Caribou are kept travelling northward.\r\nWhen there is no wind, the instinctive habit of migration doubtless\r\ndirects the general movement.\r\n\r\nHow are we to form an idea of their numbers? The only way seems\r\nto be by watching the great migration to its winter range. For the\r\nreasons already given this was impossible in my case, therefore,\r\nI array some of the known facts that will evidence the size of the\r\nherd.\r\n\r\nWarburton Pike, who saw them at Mackay Lake, October 20, 1889, says:\r\n\"I cannot believe that the herds [of Buffalo] on the prairie ever\r\nsurpassed in size La Foule (the throng) of the Caribou. La Foule\r\nhad really come, and during its passage of six days I was able to\r\nrealize what an extraordinary number of these animals still roam\r\nthe Barren Grounds.\"\r\n\r\nFrom figures and facts given me by H. T. Munn, of Brandon, Manitoba,\r\nI reckon that in three weeks following July 25, 1892, he saw at\r\nArtillery Lake (N. latitude 62 1/2 degrees, W. Long. 112 degrees)\r\nnot less than 2,000,000 Caribou travelling southward; he calls this\r\nmerely the advance guard of the great herd. Colonel Jones (Buffalo\r\nJones), who saw the herd in October at Clinton-Colden, has given me\r\npersonally a description that furnishes the basis for an interesting\r\ncalculation of their numbers.\r\n\r\nHe stood on a hill in the middle of the passing throng, with a\r\nclear view ten miles each way and it was one army of Caribou. How\r\nmuch further they spread, he did not know. Sometimes they were\r\nbunched, so that a hundred were on a space one hundred feet square;\r\nbut often there would be spaces equally large without any. They\r\naveraged at least one hundred Caribou to the acre; and they passed\r\nhim at the rate of about three miles an hour. He did not know how\r\nlong they were in passing this point; but at another place they\r\nwere four days, and travelled day and night. The whole world seemed\r\na moving mass of Caribou. He got the impression at last that they\r\nwere standing still and he was on a rocky hill that was rapidly\r\nrunning through their hosts.\r\n\r\nEven halving these figures, to keep on the safe side, we find that\r\nthe number of Caribou in this army was over 25,000,000. Yet it is\r\npossible that there are several such armies. In which case they\r\nmust indeed out-number the Buffalo in their palmiest epoch. So much\r\nfor their abundance to-day. To what extent are they being destroyed?\r\nI looked into this question with care.\r\n\r\nFirst, of the Indian destruction. In 1812 the Chipewyan population,\r\naccording to Kennicott, was 7,500. Thomas Anderson, of Fort Smith,\r\nshowed me a census of the Mackenzie River Indians, which put them\r\nat 3,961 in 1884. Official returns of the Canadian government give\r\nthem in 1905 at 3,411, as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\nPeel .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  400\r\nArctic Red River .  .  .  .  .  .  100\r\nGood Hope  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  500\r\nNorman  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  300\r\nWrigley .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  100\r\nSimpson .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  300\r\nRae  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  800\r\nLiard and Nelson .  .  .  .  .  .  400\r\nYellowknives  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  151\r\nDogribs .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  123\r\nChipewyans .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  123\r\nHay River  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  114\r\n                                 -----\r\n                                 3,411\r\n\r\n\r\nOf these the Hay River and Liard Indians, numbering about 500, can\r\nscarcely be considered Caribou-eaters, so that the Indian population\r\nfeeding on Caribou to-day is about 3,000, less than half what it\r\nwas 100 years ago.\r\n\r\nOf these not more than 600 are hunters. The traders generally agree\r\nthat the average annual kill of Caribou is about 10 or 20 per man,\r\nnot more. When George Sanderson, of Fort Resolution, got 75 one\r\nyear, it was the talk of the country; many got none. Thus 20,000\r\nper annum killed by the Indians is a liberal estimate to-day.\r\n\r\nThere has been so much talk about destruction by whalers that I\r\nwas careful to gather all available information. Several travellers\r\nwho had visited Hershell Island told me that four is the usual\r\nnumber of whalers that winter in the north-east of Point Barrow.\r\nSometimes, but rarely, the number is increased to eight or ten,\r\nnever more. They buy what Caribou they can from Eskimo, sometimes\r\naggregating 300 or 400 carcasses in a winter, and would use more\r\nif they could get them, but they cannot, as the Caribou herds are\r\nthen far south. This, E. Sprake Jones, William Hay, and others,\r\nare sure represents fairly the annual destruction by whalers on\r\nthe north coast. Only one or two vessels of this traffic go into\r\nHudson's Bay, and these with those of Hershell are all that touch\r\nCaribou country, so that the total destruction by whalers must be\r\nunder 1,000 head per annum.\r\n\r\nThe Eskimo kill for their own use. Franz Boas (\"Handbook of American\r\nIndians\") gives the number of Eskimo in the central region at\r\n1,100. Of these not more than 300 are hunters. If we allow their\r\ndestruction to equal that of the 600 Indians, it is liberal, giving\r\na total of 40,000 Caribou killed by native hunters. As the whites\r\nrarely enter the region, this is practically all the destruction\r\nby man. The annual increase of 30,000,000 Caribou must be several\r\nmillions and would so far overbalance the hunter toll that the\r\nlatter cannot make any permanent difference.\r\n\r\nThere is, moreover, good evidence that the native destruction has\r\ndiminished. As already seen, the tribes which hunt the Barren-Ground\r\nCaribou, number less than one-half of what they did 100 years ago.\r\nSince then, they have learned to use the rifle, and this, I am\r\nassured by all the traders, has lessened the destruction. By the\r\nold method, with the spear in the water, or in the pound trap, one\r\nnative might kill 100 Caribou in one day, during the migrations;\r\nbut these methods called for woodcraft and were very laborious. The\r\nrifle being much easier, has displaced the spear; but there is a\r\nlimit to its destruction, especially with cartridges at five cents\r\nto seven cents each, and, as already seen, the hunters do not\r\naverage 20 Caribou each in a year.\r\n\r\nThus, all the known facts point to a greatly diminished slaughter\r\nto-day when compared with that of 100 years ago. This, then, is my\r\nsummary of the Barren-Ground Caribou between the Mackenzie River\r\nand Hudson's Bay. They number over 30,000,000, and may be double\r\nof that. They are in primitive conditions and probably never more\r\nnumerous than now.\r\n\r\nThe native destruction is less now than formerly and never did make\r\nany perceptible difference.\r\n\r\nFinally, the matter has by no means escaped the attention of the\r\nwide-awake Canadian government represented by the Minister of the\r\nInterior and the Royal North-west Mounted Police. It could not be\r\nin better hands; and there is no reason to fear in any degree a\r\nrepetition of the Buffalo slaughter that disgraced the plains of\r\nthe United States.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XL\r\n\r\nOLD FORT RELIANCE TO FORT RESOLUTION\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAll night the storm of rain and snow raged around our camp on\r\nthe south shore of Artillery Lake, but we were up and away in the\r\nmorning in spite of it. That day, we covered five portages (they\r\ntook two days in coming out). Next day we crossed Lake Harry and\r\ncamped three-quarters of a mile farther on the long portage. Next\r\nday, September 11, we camped (still in storm) at the Lobstick Landing\r\nof Great Slave Lake. How tropically rich all this vegetation looked\r\nafter the \"Land of little sticks.\" Rain we could face, but high\r\nwinds on the big water were dangerous, so we were storm-bound until\r\nSeptember 14, when we put off, and in two hours were at old Fort\r\nReliance, the winter quarters of Sir George Back in 1833-4. In the\r\nFar North the word \"old\" means \"abandoned\" and the fort, abandoned\r\nlong ago, had disappeared, except the great stone chimneys. Around\r\none of these that intrepid explorer and hunter-Buffalo Jones-had\r\nbuilt a shanty in 1897. There it stood in fairly good condition,\r\na welcome shelter from the storm which now set in with redoubled\r\nfury. We soon had the big fireplace aglow and, sitting there in\r\ncomfort that we owed to him, and surrounded by the skeletons of\r\nthe Wolves that he had killed about the door in that fierce winter\r\ntime, we drank in hot and copious tea the toast: Long life and\r\nprosperity to our host so far away, the brave old hunter, \"Buffalo\r\nJones.\"\r\n\r\nThe woods were beautiful and abounded with life, and the three\r\ndays we spent there were profitably devoted to collecting, but on\r\nSeptember 17 we crossed the bay, made the short portage, and at\r\nnight camped 32 miles away, on the home track.\r\n\r\nNext morning we found a camp of Indians down to the last of their\r\nfood. We supplied them with flour and tobacco. They said that\r\nno Caribou had come to the Lake, showing how erratic is the great\r\nmigration.\r\n\r\nIn the afternoon we came across another band in still harder luck.\r\nThey had nothing whatever but the precarious catch of the nets,\r\nand this was the off-season. Again we supplied them, and these were\r\namong the unexpected emergencies for which our carefully guarded\r\nsupplies came in.\r\n\r\nIn spite of choppy seas we made from 30 to 35 miles a day, and\r\ncamped on Tal-thel-lay the evening of September 20. That night as\r\nI sat by the fire the moon rose in a clear sky and as I gazed on\r\nher calm bright disc something seemed to tell me that at that moment\r\nthe dear ones far away were also looking on that radiant face.\r\n\r\nOn the 21st we were storm-bound at Et-then Island, but utilised\r\nthe time collecting. I gathered a lot of roots of Pulsatilla and\r\nCalypso. Here Billy amused us by catching Wiskajons in an old-fashioned\r\nspringle that dated from the days when guns were unknown; but the\r\ncaptured birds came back fearlessly each time after being released.\r\n\r\nAll that day we had to lie about camp, keeping under cover on account\r\nof the rain. It was dreary work listening to the surf ceaselessly\r\npounding the shore and realising that all these precious hours\r\nwere needed to bring us to Fort Resolution, where the steamer was\r\nto meet us on the 25th.\r\n\r\nOn the 23d it was calmer and we got away in the gray dawn at 5.45.\r\nWe were now in Weeso's country, and yet he ran us into a singular\r\npocket that I have called Weeso's Trap--a straight glacial groove\r\na mile long that came to a sudden end and we had to go back that\r\nmile.\r\n\r\nThe old man was much mortified over his blunder, but he did not\r\nfeel half so badly about it as I did, for every hour was precious\r\nnow.\r\n\r\nWhat a delight it was to feel our canoe skimming along under the\r\nfour paddles. Three times as fast we travelled now as when we came\r\nout with the bigger boat; 5 1/2 miles an hour was frequently our\r\nrate and when we camped that night we had covered 47 miles since\r\ndawn.\r\n\r\nOn Kahdinouay we camped and again a storm arose to pound and bluster\r\nall night. In spite of a choppy sea next day we reached the small\r\nisland before the final crossing; and here, perforce, we stayed\r\nto await a calmer sea. Later we heard that during this very storm\r\na canoe-load of Indians attempted the crossing and upset; none were\r\nswimmers, all were drowned.\r\n\r\nWe were not the only migrants hurrying southward. Here for the\r\nfirst time in my life I saw Wild Swans, six in a flock. They were\r\nheading southward and flew not in very orderly array, but ever\r\nchanging, occasionally forming the triangle after the manner of\r\nGeese. They differ from Geese in flapping more slowly, from White\r\nCranes in flapping faster, and seemed to vibrate only the tips of\r\nthe wings. This was on the 23d. Next day we saw another flock of\r\nseven; I suppose that in each case it was the old one and young of\r\nthe year.\r\n\r\nAs they flew they uttered three different notes: a deep horn-like\r\n\"too\" or \"coo,\" a higher pitched \"coo,\" and a warble-like\r\n\"tootle-tootle,\" or sometimes simply \"tee-tee.\" Maybe the last did\r\nnot come from the Swans, but no other birds were near; I suppose\r\nthat these three styles of notes came from male, female, and young.\r\n\r\nNext morning 7 flocks of Swans flew overhead toward the south-west.\r\nThey totalled 46; 12 were the most in one flock. In this large flock\r\nI saw a quarrel No. 2 turned back and struck No. 3, his long neck\r\nbent and curled like a snake, both dropped downward several feet\r\nthen 3, 4 and 5 left that flock. I suspect they were of another\r\nfamily.\r\n\r\nBut, later, as we entered the river mouth we had a thrilling glimpse\r\nof Swan life. Flock after flock came in view as we rounded the rush\r\nbeds; 12 flocks in all we saw, none had less than 5 in it, nearly\r\n100 Swans in sight, at once, and all rose together with a mighty\r\nflapping of strong, white wings, and the chorus of the insignificant\r\n\"too-too-tees\" sailed farther southward, probably to make the great\r\nSwan tryst on Hay River.\r\n\r\nNo doubt these were the same 12 flocks as those observed on the\r\nprevious days, but still it rejoiced my heart to see even that\r\nmany. I had feared that the species was far gone on the trail of\r\nthe Passenger Pigeon.\r\n\r\nBut this is anticipating. We were camped still on the island north\r\nof the traverse, waiting for possible water. All day we watched In\r\nvain, all night the surf kept booming, but at three in the morning\r\nthe wind dropped, at four it was obviously calmer. I called the\r\nboys and we got away before six; dashing straight south in spite\r\nof rolling seas we crossed the 15-mile stretch in 3 3/4 hours, and\r\nturning westward reached Stony Island by noon. Thence southward\r\nthrough ever calmer water our gallant boat went spinning, reeling\r\noff the level miles up the river channel, and down again on its\r\nsouth-west branch, in a glorious red sunset, covering in one day\r\nthe journeys of four during our outgoing, in the supposedly far\r\nspeedier York boat. Faster and faster we seemed to fly, for we had\r\nthe grand incentive that we must catch the steamer at any price\r\nthat night. Weeso now, for the first time, showed up strong; knowing\r\nevery yard of the way he took advantage of every swirl of the river;\r\nin and out among the larger islands we darted, and when we should\r\nhave stopped for the night no man said \"Stop\", but harder we\r\npaddled. We could smell the steamer smoke, we thought, and pictured\r\nher captain eagerly scanning the offing for our flying canoe; it\r\nwas most inspiring and the Ann Seton jumped up to 6 miles an hour\r\nfor a time. So we went; the night came down, but far away were the\r\nglittering lights of Fort Resolution, and the steamer that should\r\nend our toil. How cheering. The skilly pilot and the lusty paddler\r\nslacked not--40 miles we had come that day--and when at last some\r\n49, nearly 50, paddled miles brought us stiff and weary to the\r\nlanding it was only to learn that the steamer, notwithstanding\r\nbargain set and agreed on, had gone south two days before.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLI\r\n\r\nGOING UP THE LOWER SLAVE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat we thought about the steamboat official who was responsible\r\nfor our dilemma we did not need to put into words; for every one\r\nknew of the bargain and its breach: nearly every one present had\r\nprotested at the time, and the hardest things I felt like saying\r\nwere mild compared with the things already said by that official's\r\nown colleagues. But these things were forgotten in the hearty greetings\r\nof friends and bundles of letters from home. It was eight o'clock,\r\nand of course black night when we landed; yet it was midnight when\r\nwe thought of sleep.\r\n\r\nFort Resolution is always dog-town; and now it seemed at its\r\nworst. When the time came to roll up in our blankets, we were fully\r\npossessed of the camper's horror of sleeping indoors; but it was\r\ntoo dark to put up a tent and there was not a square foot of ground\r\nanywhere near that was not polluted and stinking of \"dog-sign,\"\r\nso very unwillingly I broke my long spell of sleeping out, on this\r\n131st day, and passed the night on the floor of the Hudson's Bay\r\nCompany house. I had gone indoors to avoid the \"dog-sign\" and next\r\nmorning found, alas, that I had been lying all night on \"cat-sign.\"\r\n\r\nI say lying; I did not sleep. The closeness of the room, in spite\r\nof an open window, the novelty, the smells, combined with the\r\nexcitement of letters from home, banished sleep until morning came,\r\nand, of course, I got a bad cold, the first I had had all summer.\r\n\r\nHere I said \"good-bye\" to old Weeso. He grinned affably, and when I\r\nasked what he would like for a present said, \"Send me an axe like\r\nyours,\" There were three things in my outfit that aroused the cupidity\r\nof nearly every Indian, the Winchester rifle, the Peterboro canoe\r\nand the Marble axe, \"the axe that swallows its face.\" Weeso had\r\na rifle, we could not spare or send him a canoe, so I promised to\r\nsend him the axe. Post is slow, but it reached him six months later\r\nand I doubt not is even now doing active service.\r\n\r\nHaving missed the last steamer, we must go on by canoe. Canoeing\r\nup the river meant \"tracking\" all the way; that is, the canoe must\r\nbe hauled up with a line, by a man walking on the banks; hard work\r\nneeding not only a strong, active man, but one who knows the river.\r\nThrough the kindness of J. McLeneghan, of the Swiggert Trading\r\nCompany, I was spared the horrors of my previous efforts to secure\r\nhelp at Fort Resolution, and George  Sanderson, a strong young\r\nhalf-breed, agreed to take me to Fort Smith for $2.00 a day and\r\nmeans of returning. George was a famous hunter and fisher, and\r\na \"good man\" to travel. I marked his broad shoulders and sinewy,\r\nactive form with joy, especially in view of his reputation. In one\r\nrespect he was different from all other half-breeds that I ever\r\nknew--he always gave a straight answer. Ask an ordinary half-breed,\r\nor western white man, indeed, how far it is to such a point, his\r\nreply commonly is, \"Oh, not so awful far,\" or \"It is quite a piece,\"\r\nor \"It aint such a hell of a ways,\" conveying to the stranger no\r\nshadow of idea whether it is a hundred yards, a mile, or a week's\r\ntravel. Again and again when Sanderson was asked how far it was to\r\na given place, he would pause and say, \"Three miles and a half,\"\r\nor \"Little more than eight miles,\" as the case might be. The usual\r\nhalf-breed when asked if we could make such a point by noon would\r\nsay \"Maybe. I don't know. It is quite a piece.\" Sanderson would\r\nsay, \"Yes,\" or \"No, not by two miles,\" according to circumstances;\r\nand his information was always correct; he knew the river \"like a\r\nbook.\"\r\n\r\nOn the afternoon of September 27 we left \"Dogtown\" with Sanderson\r\nin Weeso's place and began our upward journey. George proved as\r\ngood as his reputation. The way that active fellow would stride\r\nalong the shore, over logs and brush, around fallen trees, hauling\r\nthe canoe against stream some three or four miles an hour was\r\nperfectly fine; and each night my heart was glad and sang the old\r\nrefrain, \"A day's march nearer home.\"\r\n\r\nThe toil of this tracking is second only to that of portageing.\r\nThe men usually relieve each other every 30 minutes. So Billy and\r\nGeorge were the team. If I were going again into that country and\r\nhad my choice these two again would be my crew.\r\n\r\nOnce or twice I took the track-line myself for a quarter of an hour,\r\nbut it did not appeal to me as a permanent amusement. It taught me\r\none thing that I did not suspect, namely, that it is much harder to\r\nhaul a canoe with three inches of water under her keel than with\r\nthree feet. In the former case, the attraction of the bottom is\r\nmost powerful and evident. The experience also explained the old\r\nsailor phrase about the vessel feeling the bottom: this I had often\r\nheard, but never before comprehended.\r\n\r\nAll day we tracked, covering 20 to 25 miles between camps and hourly\r\nmaking observations on the wild life of the river. Small birds and\r\nmammals were evidently much more abundant than in spring, and the\r\nbroad, muddy, and sandy reaches of the margin were tracked over by\r\nChipmunks, Weasels, Foxes, Lynxes, Bear, and Moose.\r\n\r\nA Lynx, which we surprised on a sand-bar, took to the water without\r\nhesitation and swam to the mainland. It went as fast as a dog, but\r\nnot nearly so fast as a Caribou. A large Fox that we saw crossing\r\nthe river proved very inferior to the Lynx in swimming speed.\r\n\r\nThe two portages, Ennuyeux and Detour, were duly passed, and on the\r\nmorning of October 3, as we travelled, a sailboat hove into sight.\r\nIt held Messrs. Thomas Christy, C. Harding, and Stagg. We were now\r\nwithin 11 days of Fort Smith, so I took advantage of the opportunity\r\nto send Sanderson back. On the evening of the 3d we came to Salt\r\nRiver, and there we saw Pierre Squirrel with his hundred dogs and\r\nat 1 P. M., October 4, arrived at Fort Smith.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLII\r\n\r\nFORT SMITH AND THE TUG\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHere again we had the unpleasant experience of sleeping indoors,\r\na miserable, sleepless, stifling night, followed by the inevitable\r\ncold.\r\n\r\nNext day we rode with our  things over the portage to Smith Landing.\r\nI had secured the tug Ariel to give us a lift, and at 7 P. M.,\r\nOctober 5, pulled out for the next stretch of the river, ourselves\r\naboard the tug, the canoe with a cargo towed behind.\r\n\r\nThat night we slept at the saw-mill, perforce, and having had\r\nenough of indoors, I spread my, blankets outside, with the result,\r\nas I was warned, that every one of the numerous dogs came again and\r\nagain, and passed, his opinion on my slumbering form. Next night\r\nwe selected an island to camp on, the men did not want to stay on\r\nthe mainland, for \"the woods are full of mice and their feet are so\r\ncold when they run over your face as you sleep.\" We did not set up\r\nour tents that time but lay on the ground; next morning at dawn,\r\nwhen I looked around, the camp was like a country graveyard, for\r\nwe were all covered with leaves, and each man was simply a long\r\nmound. The dawn came up an ominous rose-red. I love not the rosy\r\ndawn; a golden dawn or a chill-blue dawn is happy, but I fear the\r\ndawn of rose as the red headlight of a storm. It came; by 8.30 the\r\nrain had set in and steadily fell all day.\r\n\r\nThe following morning we had our first accident. The steamer with\r\nthe loaded canoe behind was rushing up a rapid. A swirl of water\r\nupset the canoe, and all our large packs were afloat. All were\r\nquickly recovered except a bag of salted skins. These sank and were\r\nseen no more.\r\n\r\nOn October 9 we arrived at Fort Chipewyan. As we drew near that\r\nfamous place of water-fowl, the long strings and massed flocks of\r\nvarious geese and ducks grew more and more plentiful; and at the\r\nFort itself we found their metropolis. The Hudson's Bay Company\r\nhad killed and salted about 600 Waveys or Snow Geese; each of the\r\nLoutit families, about 500; not less than 12,000 Waveys will be\r\nsalted down this fall, besides Honkers, White-fronts and Ducks.\r\nEach year they reckon on about 10,000 Waveys, in poor years they\r\ntake 5,000 to 6,000, in fat years 15,000. The Snow and White-fronted\r\nGeese all had the white parts of the head more or less stained with\r\norange. Only one Blue Goose had been taken. This I got; it is a\r\nwesternmost record. No Swans had been secured this year; in fact,\r\nI am told that they are never taken in the fall because they never\r\ncome this way, though they visit the east end of the lake; in the\r\nspring they come by here and about 20 are taken each year. Chipewyan\r\nwas Billy Loutit's home, and the family gave a dance in honour of\r\nthe wanderer's return. Here I secured a tall half-breed, Gregoire\r\nDaniell, usually known as \"Bellalise,\" to go with me as far as\r\nAthabaska Landing.\r\n\r\nThere was no good reason why we should not leave Chipewyan in three\r\nhours. But the engineer of my tug had run across an old friend;\r\nthey wanted to have a jollification, as of course the engine\r\nwas \"hopelessly out of order.\" But we got away at 7 next day--my\r\nfour men and the tug's three. At the wheel was a halfbreed--David\r\nMacPherson--who is said to be a natural-born pilot, and the best\r\nin the country. Although he never was on the Upper Slave before,\r\nand it is an exceedingly difficult stream with its interminable,\r\nintricate, shifting shallows, crooked, narrow channels, and\r\nimpenetrable muddy currents, his \"nose for water\" is so good that\r\nhe brought us through at full speed without striking once. Next\r\ntime he Will be qualified to do it by night.\r\n\r\nIn the grove where we camped after sundown were the teepee and\r\nshack of an Indian (Chipewyan) Brayno (probably Brenaud). This is\r\nhis hunting and trapping ground, and has been for years. No one\r\npoaches on it; that is unwritten law; a man may follow a wounded\r\nanimal into his neighbour's territory, but not trap there. The\r\nnearest neighbour is 10 miles off. He gets 3 or 4 Silver Foxes\r\nevery year, a few Lynx, Otter, Marten, etc.\r\n\r\nBellalise was somewhat of a character. About 6 feet 4 in height,\r\nwith narrow, hollow chest, very large hands and feet and a nervous,\r\nrestless way of flinging himself about. He struck me as a man who\r\nwas killing himself with toil beyond his physical strength. He was\r\nstrongly recommended by the Hudson's Bay Company people as a \"good\r\nman,\" I liked his face and manners, he was an intelligent companion,\r\nand I was glad to have secured him. At the first and second camps\r\nhe worked hard. At the next he ceased work suddenly and went aside;\r\nhis stomach was upset. A few hours afterwards he told me he was\r\nfeeling ill. The engineer, who wanted him to cut wood, said to me,\r\n\"That man is shamming.\" My reply was short: \"You have known him\r\nfor months, and think he is shamming; I have known him for hours\r\nand I know he is not that kind of a man.\"\r\n\r\nHe told me next morning, \"It's no use, I got my breast crushed by\r\nthe tug a couple of weeks ago, I have no strength. At Fort McKay\r\nis a good man named Jiarobia, he will go with you.\"\r\n\r\nSo when the tug left us Bellalise refunded his advance and returned\r\nto Chipewyan. He was one of those that made me think well of his\r\npeople; and his observations on the wild life of the country showed\r\nthat he had a tongue to tell, as well as eyes to see.\r\n\r\nThat morning, besides the calls of Honkers and Waveys we heard the\r\nglorious trumpeting of the White Crane. It has less rattling croak\r\nand more whoop than that of the Brown Crane. Bellalise says that\r\nevery year a few come to Chipewyan, then go north with the Waveys\r\nto breed. In the fall they come back for a month; they are usually\r\nin flocks of three and four; two old ones and their offspring,\r\nthe latter known by their brownish colour. If you get the two old\r\nones, the young ones are easily killed, as they keep flying low\r\nover the place.\r\n\r\nIs this then the secret of its disappearance? and is it on these\r\nfar breeding grounds that man has proved too hard?\r\n\r\nAt Lobstick Point, 2 P. M., October 13, the tug turned back and\r\nwe three continued our journey as before, Preble and Billy taking\r\nturns at tracking the canoe.\r\n\r\nNext day we reached Fort McKay and thus marked another important\r\nstage of the journey.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLIII\r\n\r\nFORT McKAY AND JIAROBIA\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFort McKay was the last point at which we saw the Chipewyan style\r\nof teepee, and the first where the Cree appeared. But its chief\r\ninterest to us lay in the fact that it was the home of Jiarobia, a\r\ncapable river-man who wished to go to Athabaska Landing. The first\r\nthing that struck us about Jiarobia--whose dictionary name by the\r\nway is Elzear Robillard--was that his house had a good roof and\r\na large pile of wood ready cut. These were extremely important\r\nindications in a land of improvidence. Robillard was a thin, active,\r\nhalf-breed of very dark skin. He was willing to go for $2.00 a day\r\nthe round-trip (18 days) plus food and a boat to return with. But\r\na difficulty now appeared; Madame Robillard, a tall, dark half-breed\r\nwoman, objected: \"Elzear had been away all summer, he should stay\r\nhome now.\" \"If you go I will run off into the backwoods with the\r\nfirst wild Indian that wants a squaw,\" she threatened. \"Now,\" said\r\nRob, in choice English, \"I am up against it.\" She did not understand\r\nEnglish, but she could read looks and had some French, so I took\r\na hand.\r\n\r\n\"If Madame will consent I will advance $15.00 of her husband's pay\r\nand will let her select the finest silk handkerchief in the Hudson's\r\nBay store for a present.\"\r\n\r\nIn about three minutes her Cree eloquence died a natural death;\r\nshe put a shawl on her head and stepped toward the door without\r\nlooking at me. Rob, nodded to me, and signed to go to the Hudson's\r\nBay store; by which I inferred that the case was won; we were going\r\nnow to select the present. To my amazement she turned from all the\r\nbright-coloured goods and selected a large black silk handkerchief.\r\n\r\nThe men tell me it is always so now; fifty years ago every woman\r\nwanted red things. Now all want black; and the traders who made\r\nthe mistake of importing red have had to import dyes and dip them\r\nall.\r\n\r\nJiarobia, or, as we mostly call him, \"Rob,\" proved most amusing\r\ncharacter as well as a \"good man\" and the reader will please note\r\nthat nearly all of my single help were \"good men.\" Only when I had\r\na crowd was there trouble. His store of anecdote was unbounded and\r\nhis sense of humour ever present, if broad and simple. He talked\r\nin English, French, and Cree, and knew a good deal of Chipewyan.\r\nMany of his personal adventures would have fitted admirably into\r\nthe Decameron, but are scarcely suited for this narrative. One\r\nevening he began to sing, I listened intently, thinking maybe I\r\nshould pick up some ancient chanson of the voyageurs or at least\r\na woodman's \"Come-all-ye.\" Alas! it proved to be nothing but the\r\n\"Whistling Coon.\"\r\n\r\nWhich reminds me of another curious experience at the village of\r\nFort Smith. I saw a crowd of the Indians about a lodge and strange\r\nnoises proceeding therefrom. When I went over the folk made way for\r\nme. I entered, sat down, and found that they were crowded around\r\na cheap gramophone which was hawking, spitting and screeching some\r\nawful rag-time music and nigger jigs. I could forgive the traders\r\nfor bringing in the gramophone, but why, oh, why, did they not\r\nbring some of the simple world-wide human songs which could at least\r\nhave had an educational effect? The Indian group listened to this\r\nweird instrument with the profoundest gravity. If there is anything\r\ninherently comic in our low comics it was entirely lost on them.\r\n\r\nOne of Rob's amusing fireside tricks was thus: He put his hands\r\ntogether, so: (illustration). \"Now de' tumbs is you and your fader,\r\nde first finger is you and your mudder, ze next is you and your\r\nsister, ze little finger is you and your brudder, ze ring finger\r\nis you and your sweetheart. You and your fader separate easy, like\r\ndat; you and your brudder like dat, you and your sister like dat,\r\ndat's easy; you and your mudder like dat, dat's not so easy; but\r\nyou and your sweetheart cannot part widout all everything go to\r\nhell first.\"\r\n\r\nLater, as we passed the American who lives at Fort McMurray, Jiarobia\r\nsaid to me: \"Dat man is the biggest awful liar on de river. You\r\nshould hear him talk. 'One day,' he said, 'dere was a big stone\r\nfloating up de muddy river and on it was tree men, and one was\r\nblind and one was plumb naked and one had no arms nor legs, and de\r\nblind man he looks down on bottom of river an see a gold watch, an\r\nde cripple he reach out and get it, and de naked man he put it in\r\nhis pocket.' Now any man talk dat way he one most awful liar, it\r\nis not possible, any part, no how.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLIV\r\n\r\nTHE RIVER\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNow we resumed our daily life of tracking, eating, tracking,\r\ncamping, tracking, sleeping. The weather had continued fine, with\r\nlittle change ever since we left Resolution, and we were so hardened\r\nto the life that it was pleasantly monotonous.\r\n\r\nHow different now were my thoughts compared with those of last\r\nSpring, as I first looked on this great river.\r\n\r\nWhen we had embarked on the leaping, boiling, muddy Athabaska, in\r\nthis frail canoe, it had seemed a foolhardy enterprise. How could\r\nsuch a craft ride such a stream for 2,000 miles? It was like a mouse\r\nmounting a monstrous, untamed, plunging and rearing horse. Now we\r\nset out each morning, familiar with stream and our boat, having no\r\nthought of danger, and viewing the water, the same turbid flood,\r\nas, our servant. Even as a skilful tamer will turn the wildest\r\nhorse into his willing slave, so have we conquered this river and\r\nmade it the bearer of our burdens. So I thought and wrote at the\r\ntime; but the wise tamer is ever alert, never lulled into false\r\nsecurity. He knows that a heedless move may turn his steed into\r\na deadly, dangerous monster. We had our lesson to learn.\r\n\r\nThat night (October 15) there was a dull yellow sunset. The morning\r\ncame with a strong north wind and rain that turned to snow, and\r\nwith it great flocks of birds migrating from the Athabaska Lake.\r\nMany rough-legged Hawks, hundreds of small land birds, thousands\r\nof Snow-birds in flocks of 20 to 200, myriads of Ducks and Geese,\r\npassed over our heads going southward before the frost. About 8.30\r\nthe Geese began to pass in ever-increasing flocks; between 9.45\r\nand 10 I counted 114 flocks averaging about 30 each (5 to 300) and\r\nthey kept on at this rate till 2 P. M. This would give a total of\r\nnearly 100,000 Geese. It was a joyful thing to see and hear them;\r\ntheir legions in flight array went stringing high aloft, so high\r\nthey looked not like Geese, but threads across the sky, the cobwebs,\r\nindeed, that Mother Carey was sweeping away with her north-wind\r\nbroom. I sketched and counted flock after flock with a sense of\r\nthankfulness that so many, were left alive. Most were White Geese,\r\nbut a twentieth, perhaps, were Honkers.\r\n\r\nThe Ducks began to pass over about noon, and became more numerous\r\nthan the Geese as they went on.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of this myriad procession, as though they were the\r\ncentre and cause of all, were two splendid White Cranes, bugling\r\nas they flew. Later that day we saw another band, of three, but\r\nthese were all; their race is nearly run.\r\n\r\nThe full moon was on and all night the wild-fowl flew. The frost\r\nwas close behind them, sharp and sudden. Next morning the ponds\r\nabout us had ice an inch thick and we heard of it three inches at\r\nother places.\r\n\r\nBut the sun came out gloriously and when at ten we landed at Fort\r\nMcMurray the day was warm and perfect in its autumnal peace.\r\n\r\nMiss Gordon, the postmaster, did not recognise us at first. She\r\nsaid we all looked \"so much older, it is always so with folks who\r\ngo north.\"\r\n\r\nNext morning we somehow left our tent behind. It was old and of\r\nlittle value, so we did not go back, and the fact that we never\r\nreally needed it speaks much for the sort of weather we had to the\r\nend of the trip.\r\n\r\nA couple of Moose (cow and calf) crossed the river ahead of us,\r\nand Billy went off in hot pursuit; but saw no more of them.\r\n\r\nTracks of animals were extremely abundant on, the shore here.\r\nLarge Wolves became quite numerous evidently we were now in their\r\ncountry. Apparently they had killed a Moose, as their dung was full\r\nof Moose hair.\r\n\r\nWe were now in the Canyon of the Athabaska and from this on our\r\njourney was a fight with the rapids. One by one my skilful boatmen\r\nnegotiated them; either we tracked up or half unloaded, or landed\r\nand portaged, but it was hard and weary work. My journal entry for\r\nthe night of the 18th runs thus:\r\n\r\n\"I am tired of troubled waters. All day to-day and for five days\r\nback we have been fighting the rapids of this fierce river. My\r\nplace is to sit in the canoe-bow with a long pole, glancing here\r\nand there, right, left, and ahead, watching ever the face of this\r\nsnarling river; and when its curling green lips apart betray a\r\nyellow brown gleam of deadly teeth too near, it is my part to ply\r\nwith might and main that pole, and push the frail canoe aside to\r\nwhere the stream is in milder, kindlier mood.' Oh, I love not a\r\nbrawling river any more than a brawling woman, and thoughts of the\r\nbroad, calm Slave, with its majestic stretches of level flood, are\r\nnow as happy halcyon memories of a bright and long-gone past.\"\r\n\r\nMy men were skilful and indefatigable. One by one we met the hard\r\nrapids in various ways, mostly by portaging, but on the morning\r\nof the 19th we came to one so small and short that all agreed the\r\ncanoe could be forced by with poles and track-line. It looked an\r\ninsignificant ripple, no more than a fish might make with its tail,\r\nand what happened in going up, is recorded as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLV\r\n\r\nTHE RIVER SHOWS ITS TEETH\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Oct. 20, 1907.--Athabaska River. In the Canyon. This has been\r\na day of horrors and mercies. We left the camp early, 6.55--long\r\nbefore sunrise, and portaged the first rapid. About 9 we came to\r\nthe middle rapid; this Billy thought we could track up, so with\r\ntwo ropes he and Rob were hauling us, I in bow, Preble in stem;\r\nbut the strong waters of the middle part whirled the canoe around\r\nsuddenly, and dashed her on a rock. There was a crash of breaking\r\ntimber, a roar of the flood, and in a moment Preble and I and, all\r\nthe stuff were in the water.\r\n\r\n\"'My journals,' I shouted as I went down, and all the time the\r\nflood was boiling in my ears my thought was, 'My journals,'--'my\r\njournals.'\r\n\r\n\"The moment my mouth was up again above the water, I bubbled out,\r\n'My journals,--save my journals,' then struck out for the shore.\r\nNow I saw Preble hanging on to the canoe and trying to right it.\r\nHis face was calm and unchanged as when setting a mousetrap. 'Never\r\nmind that, save yourself,' I called out; he made no response, and,\r\nafter all, it was safest to hang on to the canoe. I was swept into\r\na shallow place at once, and got on my feet, then gained the shore.\r\n\r\n\"'My journals--save them first!' I shouted to the two boys, and\r\nnow remembered with horror, how, this very morning, on account of\r\nportaging, I had for the first time put all three journals in the\r\nhandbag, that had disappeared, whereas the telescope that used to\r\nhold two of them, was floating high. It is the emergency that proves\r\nyour man, and I learned that day I had three of the best men that\r\never boarded a boat. A glance showed Preble in shallow water coolly\r\nhauling in the canoe.\r\n\r\n\"Rob and Billy bounded along the rugged shores, from one ice-covered\r\nrock to another, over piles of drift logs and along steep ledges\r\nthey went; like two mountain goats; the flood was spotted with\r\nfloating things, but no sign of the precious journal-bag. Away out\r\nwas the grub-box; square and high afloat, it struck a reef. 'You\r\nsave the grub,' yelled Billy above the roaring, pitiless flood,\r\nand dashed on. I knew Billy's head was cool and clear, so I plunged\r\ninto the water, ice-cold and waist deep--and before the merciless\r\none could snatch it along, I had the grub-box safe. Meanwhile Rob\r\nand Billy had danced away out of sight along that wild canyon bank.\r\nI set out after them. In some eddies various articles were afloat,\r\na cocoa tin, a milk pot, a bag of rare orchids intended for a friend,\r\na half sack of flour, and many little things I saved at cost of a\r\nfresh wetting each time, and on the bank, thrown hastily up by the\r\nboys, were such bundles as they had been able to rescue.\r\n\r\n\"I struggled on, but the pace was killing. They were young men\r\nand dog-runners; I was left behind and was getting so tired now I\r\ncould not keep warm; there was a keen frost and I was wet to the\r\nskin. The chance to rescue other things came again and again. Twelve\r\ntimes did I plunge, into that deadly cold river, and so gathered\r\na lot of small truck. Then knowing I could do little more, and\r\nrealising that everything man could do would be done without me,\r\nturned back reluctantly. Preble passed me at a run, he had left\r\nthe canoe in a good place and had saved some bedding.\r\n\r\n\"'Have you seen my journal-bag?' He made a quick gesture down the\r\nriver, then dashed away. Alas! I knew now, the one irreplaceable\r\npart of our cargo was deep in the treacherous flood, never to be\r\nseen again.\r\n\r\n\"At the canoe I set about making a fire; there was no axe to cut\r\nkindling-wood, but a birch tree was near, and a pile of shredded\r\nbirch-bark with a lot of dry willow on it made a perfect fire-lay;\r\nthen I opened my waterproof matchbox. Oh, horrors! the fifteen\r\nmatches in it were damp and soggy. I tried to dry them by blowing\r\non them; my frozen fingers could scarcely hold them. After a time\r\nI struck one. It was soft and useless; another and another at\r\nintervals, till thirteen; then,  despairing, I laid the last two on\r\na stone in the weak sunlight, and tried to warm myself by gathering\r\nfirewood and moving quickly, but it seemed useless a very death\r\nchill was on me. I have often lighted a fire with rubbing-sticks,\r\nbut I needed an axe, as well as a buckskin thong for this, and I had\r\nneither. I looked through the baggage that was saved, no matches\r\nand all things dripping wet. I might go three miles down that\r\nfrightful canyon to our last camp and maybe get some living coals.\r\nBut no! mindful of the forestry laws, we had as usual most carefully\r\nextinguished the fire with buckets of water, and the clothes were\r\nfreezing on my back. 1 was tired out, teeth chattering. Then came\r\nthe thought, Why despair while two matches remain? I struck the\r\nfirst now, the fourteenth, and, in spite of dead fingers and the\r\nsizzly, doubtful match, it cracked, blazed, and then, oh blessed,\r\nblessed birch bark!--with any other tinder my numbed hands had\r\nsurely failed--it blazed like a torch, and warmth at last was mine,\r\nand outward comfort for a house of gloom.\r\n\r\n\"The boys, I knew, would work like heroes and do their part as\r\nwell as man could do it, my work was right here. I gathered all the\r\nthings along the beach, made great racks for drying and a mighty\r\nblaze. I had no pots or pans, but an aluminum bottle which would\r\nserve as kettle; and thus I prepared a meal of such things as\r\nwere saved--a scrap of pork, some tea and a soggy mass that once\r\nwas pilot bread. Then sat down by the fire to spend five hours of\r\ngrowing horror, 175 miles from a settlement, canoe smashed, guns\r\ngone, pots and pans gone, specimens all gone, half our bedding\r\ngone, our food gone; but all these things were nothing, compared\r\nwith the loss of my three precious journals; 600 pages of observation\r\nand discovery, geographical, botanical, and zoological, 500 drawings,\r\nvaluable records made under all sorts of trying circumstances,\r\ndiscovery and compass survey of the beautiful Nyarling River,\r\ncompass survey of the two great northern lakes, discovery of two\r\ngreat northern rivers, many lakes, a thousand things of interest\r\nto others and priceless to me--my summer's work--gone; yes, I could\r\nbear that, but the three chapters of life and thought irrevocably\r\ngone; the magnitude of this calamity was crushing. Oh, God, this\r\nis the most awful blow that could have fallen at the end of the\r\nsix months' trip.\r\n\r\n\"The hours went by, and the gloom grew deeper, for there was no\r\nsign of the boys. Never till now did the thought of danger enter\r\nmy mind. Had they been too foolhardy in their struggle with the\r\nterrible stream? Had they, too, been made to feel its power? My guess\r\nwas near the truth; and yet there was that awful river unchanged,\r\nglittering, surging, beautiful, exactly as on so many days before,\r\nwhen life on it had seemed so bright.\r\n\r\n\"At three in the afternoon, I saw a fly crawl down the rocks a\r\nmile away. I fed the fire and heated up the food and tea. In twenty\r\nminutes I could see that it was Rob, but both his hands were empty.\r\n'If they had found it,' I said to myself, 'they would send it back\r\nfirst thing, and if he had it, he would swing it aloft,' Yet no,\r\nnothing but a shiny tin was in his hands and the blow had fallen.\r\nThe suspense was over, anyway. I bowed my head, 'We have done what\r\nwe could.'\r\n\r\n\"Rob came slowly up, worn out. In his hand a tin of baking-powder.\r\nAcross his breast was a canvas band. He tottered toward me, too\r\ntired to speak in answer to my unspoken question, but he turned\r\nand there on his back was the canvas bag that held labour of all\r\nthese long toilsome months.\r\n\r\n\"'I got 'em, all right,' he managed to say, smiling in a weak way.\r\n\r\n\"'And the boys?'\r\n\r\n\"'All right now.'\r\n\r\n\"'Thank God!' I broke down, and wrung his hand; 'I won't forget,'\r\nwas all I could say. Hot tea revived him, loosened his tongue, and\r\nI heard the story.\r\n\r\n\"I knew,' he said, 'what was first to save when I seen you got\r\nashore. Me and Billy we run like crazy, we see dat bag 'way out in\r\nthe deep strong water. De odder tings came in de eddies, but dat\r\nbag it keep 'way out, but we run along de rocks; after a mile it\r\ncame pretty near a point, and Billy, he climb on a rock and reach\r\nout, but he fall in deep water and was carried far, so he had to\r\nswim for his life. I jump on rocks anoder mile to anoder point; I\r\ngot ahead of de bag, den I get two logs, and hold dem between my\r\nlegs for raft, and push out; but dat dam river he take dem logs\r\nvery slow, and dat bag very fast, so it pass by. But Billy he swim\r\nashore, and run some more, and he make a raft; but de raft he stick\r\non rock, and de bag he never stick, but go like hell.\r\n\r\n\"'Den I say, \"Here, Billy, you give me yo' sash,\" and I run tree mile\r\nmore, so far I loss sight of dat bag and make good raft. By'mebye\r\nBilly he come shouting and point, I push out in river, and paddle,\r\nand watch, and sure dere come dat bag. My, how he travel! far out\r\nnow; but I paddle and push hard and bump he came at raft and I grab\r\nhim. Oh! maybe I warn't glad! ice on river, frost in air, 14 mile\r\nrun on snowy rocks, but I no care, I bet I make dat boss glad when\r\nhe see me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Glad! I never felt more thankful in my life! My heart swelled with\r\ngratitude to the brave boys that had leaped, scrambled, slidden,\r\ntumbled, fallen, swum or climbed over those 14 perilous, horrible\r\nmiles of icy rocks and storm-piled timbers, to save the books that,\r\nto them, seemed of so little value, but which they yet knew were,\r\nto me, the most precious of all my things. Guns, cameras, food,\r\ntents, bedding, dishes, were trifling losses, and the horror of\r\nthat day was turned to joy by the crowning mercy of its close.\r\n\r\n\"'I won't forget you when we reach the Landing, Rob!' were, the\r\nmeagre words that rose to my lips, but the tone of voice supplied\r\nwhat the words might lack. And I did not forget him or the others;\r\nand Robillard said afterward, 'By Gar, dat de best day's work I\r\never done, by Gar, de time I run down dat hell river after dem dam\r\nbooks!'\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLVI\r\n\r\nBRIGHT AGAIN\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn an hour the other men came, back. The rest of the day we put\r\nin drying the things, especially our bedding. We used the aluminum\r\nbottle, and an old meat tin for kettle; some bacon, happily saved,\r\nwas fried on sticks, and when we turned in that night it was with\r\nlight and thankful hearts, in spite of our manifold minor losses.\r\n\r\nMorning dawned bright and beautiful and keen. How glorious that\r\nsurging river looked in its noble canyon; but we were learning\r\nthoroughly that noble scenery means dangerous travel--and there\r\nwas much noble scenery ahead; and I, at least, felt much older than\r\nbefore this upset.\r\n\r\nThe boys put in a couple  of hours repairing the canoe, then they\r\nstudied the river in hopes of recovering the guns. How well the\r\nriver-men seemed to know it! Its every ripple and curl told them\r\na story of the bottom and the flood.\r\n\r\n\"There must be a ledge there,\" said Billy, \"just where we upset.\r\nIf the guns went down at once they are there. If they were carried\r\nat all, the bottom is smooth to the second ledge and they are\r\nthere.\" He pointed a hundred yards away.\r\n\r\nSo they armed themselves with grappling-poles that had nails for\r\nclaws. Then we lowered Rob in the canoe into the rapid and held on\r\nwhile he fished above the ledge.\r\n\r\n\"I tink I feel 'em,\" said Rob, again and again, but could not bring\r\nthem up. Then Billy tried.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, they are there.\" But the current was too fierce and the hook\r\ntoo poor; he could not hold them.\r\n\r\nThen I said: \"There is only one thing to do. A man must go in at\r\nthe end of the rope; maybe he can reach down. I'll never send any\r\nman into such a place, but I'll go myself.\"\r\n\r\nSo I stripped, padded the track-line with a towel and put it around\r\nmy waist, then plunged in. Ouch! it was cold, and going seven miles\r\nan hour. The boys lowered me to the spot where I was supposed to\r\ndive or reach down. It was only five feet deep, but, struggle as\r\nI might, I could not get even my arm down. I ducked and dived, but\r\nI was held in the surface like a pennant on an air-blast. In a few\r\nminutes the icy flood had robbed me of all sensation in my limbs,\r\nand showed how impossible was the plan, so I gave the signal to\r\nhaul me in; which they did, nearly cutting my body in two with the\r\nrope. And if ever there was a grovelling fire-worshipper, it was\r\nmy frozen self when I landed.\r\n\r\nNow we tried a new scheme. A tall spruce on the shore was leaning\r\nover the place; fifty feet out, barely showing, was the rock that\r\nwrecked us. We cut the spruce so it fell with its butt on the shore,\r\nand lodged against the rock. On this, now, Rob and Billy walked\r\nout and took turns grappling. Luck was with Rob. In a few minutes\r\nhe triumphantly hauled up the rifle and a little later the shotgun,\r\nnone the worse.\r\n\r\nNow, we had saved everything except the surplus provisions and my\r\nlittle camera, trifling matters, indeed; so it was with feelings\r\nof triumph that we went on south that day.\r\n\r\nIn the afternoon, as we were tracking up the last part of the Boiler\r\nRapid, Billy at the bow, Rob on the shore, the line broke, and we\r\nwere only saved from another dreadful disaster by Billy's nerve\r\nand quickness; for he fearlessly leaped overboard, had the luck to\r\nfind bottom, and held the canoe's head with all his strength. The\r\nrope was mended and a safe way was found. That time I realized\r\nthe force of an Indian reply to a trader who sought to sell him a\r\ncheap rope. \"In the midst of a rapid one does not count the cost\r\nof the line.\"\r\n\r\nAt night we camped in a glorious red sunset, just above the Boiler\r\nRapid. On the shore was a pile of flour in sacks, inscribed in\r\nCree, \"Gordon his flour.\"\r\n\r\nHere it was, the most prized foreign product in the country, lying\r\nunprotected by the highway, and no man seemed to think the owner\r\nfoolish. Whatever else, these Indians are, they are absolutely\r\nhonest.\r\n\r\nThe heavenly weather of the Indian Summer was now upon us. We\r\nhad left all storms and frost behind, and the next day, our final\r\ntrouble, the lack of food, was ended. A great steamer hove in\r\nsight--at least it looked like a steamer--but, steadily coming on,\r\nit proved a scow with an awning and a stove on it. The boys soon\r\nrecognised the man at the bow as William Gordon, trader at Fort\r\nMcMurray. We hailed him to stop when he was a quarter of a mile\r\nahead, and he responded with his six sturdy oarsmen; but such was\r\nthe force of the stream that he did not reach the shore till a\r\nquarter-mile below us.\r\n\r\n\"Hello, boys, what's up?\" He shouted in the brotherly way that\r\nall white men seem to get when meeting another of their race in a\r\nsavage land.\r\n\r\n\"Had an upset and lost all our food.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ho! that's easy fixed.\" Then did that generous man break open\r\nboxes, bales, and packages and freely gave without a stint, all the\r\nthings we needed: kettles, pans, sugar, oatmeal, beans, jam, etc.\r\n\r\n\"How are you fixed for whiskey?\" he asked, opening his own private,\r\nnot-for-sale supply.\r\n\r\n\"We have none and we never use it,\" was the reply. Then I fear I\r\nfell very low in the eyes of my crew.\r\n\r\n\"Never use it! Don't want it! You must be pretty damn lonesome in\r\na country like this,\" and he seemed quite unable to grasp the idea\r\nof travellers who would not drink.\r\n\r\nThus the last of our troubles was ended. Thenceforth the journey\r\nwas one of warm, sunny weather and pleasant travel. Each night the\r\nsun went down in red and purple fire; and each morning rose in gold\r\non a steel-blue sky. There was only one bad side to this, that was\r\nthe constant danger of forest fire. On leaving each camp--we made\r\nfour every day--I put the fire out with plenty of water, many\r\nbuckets. Rob thought it unnecessary to take so much trouble. But\r\ngreat clouds of smoke were seen at several reaches of the river,\r\nto tell how dire it was that other campers had not done the same.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLVII\r\n\r\nWHEN NATURE SMILED\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt seems a law that every deep valley must be next a high mountain.\r\nOur sorrows ended when we quit the canyon, and then, as though in\r\ncompensation, nature crammed the days with the small joys that seem\r\nso little and mean so much to the naturalist.\r\n\r\nThose last few days, unmarred of the smallest hardship, were one\r\nlong pearl-string of the things I came for--the chances to see and\r\nbe among wild life.\r\n\r\nEach night the Coyote and the Fox came rustling about our camp, or\r\nthe Weasel and Woodmouse scrambled over our sleeping forms. Each\r\nmorning at gray dawn, gray Wiskajon and his mate--always a pair\r\ncame wailing through the woods, to flirt about the camp and steal\r\nscraps of meat that needed not to be stolen, being theirs by right.\r\nTheir small cousins, the Chicadees, came, too, at breakfast time,\r\nand in our daily travelling, Ruffed Grouse, Ravens, Pine Grosbeaks,\r\nBohemian Chatterers, Hairy Woodpeckers, Shrikes, Tree-sparrows,\r\nLinnets, and Snowbirds enlivened the radiant sunlit scene.\r\n\r\nOne afternoon I heard a peculiar note, at first like the\r\n\"cheepy-teet-teet\" of the Pine Grosbeak, only louder and more\r\nbroken, changing to the jingling of Blackbirds in spring, mixed\r\nwith some Bluejay \"jay-jays,\" and a Robin-like whistle; then I saw\r\nthat it came from a Northern Shrike on the bushes just ahead of\r\nus. It flew off much after the manner of the Summer Shrike, with\r\nflight not truly undulatory nor yet straight, but flapping half\r\na dozen times--then a pause and repeat. He would dive along down\r\nnear the ground, then up with a fine display of wings and tail to\r\nthe next perch selected, there to repeat with fresh variations and\r\nshrieks, the same strange song, and often indeed sang it on the\r\nwing, until at last he crossed the river.\r\n\r\nSometimes we rode in the canoe, sometimes tramped along the easy\r\nshore. Once I came across a Great Homed Owl in the grass by the\r\nwater. He had a fish over a foot long, and flew with difficulty\r\nwhen be bore it off. Another time I saw a Horned Owl mobbed by two\r\nWiskajons. Spruce Partridge as well as the Ruffed species became\r\ncommon: one morning some of the former marched into camp at\r\nbreakfast time. Rob called them \"Chickens\"; farther south they are\r\ncalled \"Fool Hens,\" which is descriptive and helps to distinguish\r\nthem from their neighbours--the \"Sage Hens.\" Frequently now we\r\nheard the toy-trumpeting and the clack of the Pileated Woodpecker\r\nor Cock-of-the-Pines, a Canadian rather than a Hudsonian species.\r\nOne day, at our three o'clock meal, a great splendid fellow of the\r\nkind gave us a thrill. \"Clack-clack-clack,\" we heard him coming,\r\nand he bounded through the air into the trees over our camp. Still\r\nuttering his loud \"Clack-clack-clack,\" he swung from tree to tree\r\nin one long festoon of flight, spread out on the up-swoop like an\r\nenormous black butterfly with white-starred wings. \"Clack-clack-clack,\"\r\nhe stirred the echoes from the other shore, and ignored us as he\r\nswooped and clanged. There was much in his song of the Woodpecker\r\ntang; it was very nearly the springtime \"cluck-cluck\" of a magnified\r\nFlicker in black; and I gazed with open mouth until he thought\r\nfit to bound through the air to another woods. This was my first\r\nclose meeting with the King of the Woodpeckers; I long to know him\r\nbetter. Mammals, too, abounded, but we saw their signs rather than\r\nthemselves, for most are nocturnal. The Redsquirrels, so scarce last\r\nspring, were quite plentiful, and  the beach at all soft places\r\nshowed abundant trace Of Weasels, Chipmunks, Foxes, Coyotes,\r\nLynx, Wolves, Moose, Caribou, Deer. One Wolf track was of special\r\ninterest. It was 5 1/2 inches, long and travelling with it was the\r\ntrack of a small Wolf; it vividly brought back the days of Lobo\r\nand Blanca, and I doubt not was another case of mates; we were\r\nevidently in the range of a giant Wolf who was travelling around\r\nwith his wife. Another large Wolf track was lacking the two inner\r\ntoes of the inner hind foot, and the bind foot pads were so faint\r\nas to be lost at times, although the toes were deeply impressed in\r\nthe mud. This probably meant that he, had been in a trap and was\r\nstarved to a skeleton.\r\n\r\nWe did not see any of these, but we did see the post-graduate\r\nevidences of their diet, and were somewhat surprised to learn that\r\nit included much fruit, especially of the uva-ursi. We also saw\r\nproof that they had eaten part of a Moose; probably they had killed\r\nit.\r\n\r\nCoyote abounded now, and these we saw from time to time. Once I\r\ntramped up within thirty feet of a big fellow who was pursuing some\r\nstudies behind a log. But again the incontrovertible-postmortem-evidence\r\nof their food habits was a surprise--the bulk of their sustenance\r\nnow was berries, in one case this was mixed with the tail hairs--but\r\nno body hairs--of a Chipmunk. I suppose that Chipmunk escaped minus\r\nhis tail. There was much evidence that all those creatures that\r\ncan eat fruit were in good condition, but that flesh in its most\r\naccessible form--rabbits--was unknown, and even next best thing--the\r\nmice--were too scarce to count; this weighed with especial force\r\non the Lynxes; they alone seemed unable to eke out with fruit. The\r\nfew we saw were starving and at our camp of the 28th we found the\r\nwretched body of one that was dead of hunger.\r\n\r\nOn that, same night we had a curious adventure with a Weasel.\r\n\r\nAll were sitting around the camp-fire at bed-time, when I heard\r\na distinct patter on the leaves. \"Something coming,\" I whispered.\r\nAll held still, then out of the gloom came bounding a snow-white\r\nWeasel. Preble was lying on his back with his hands clasped behind\r\nhis head and the Weasel fearlessly jumped on my colleague's broad\r\nchest, and stood peering about.\r\n\r\nIn a flash Preble's right elbow was down and held the Weasel prisoner,\r\nhis left hand coming to assist. Now, it is pretty well known that\r\nif you and a Weasel grab each other at the same time he has choice\r\nof holds.\r\n\r\n\"I have got him,\" said Preble, then added feelingly, \"but he got\r\nme first. Suffering Moses! the little cuss is grinding his teeth\r\nin deeper.\"\r\n\r\nThe muffled screaming of the small demon died away as Preble's\r\nstrong left hand crushed out his life, but as long as there was a\r\nspark of it remaining, those desperate jaws were grinding deeper\r\ninto his thumb. It seemed a remarkably long affair to us, and from\r\ntime to time, as Preble let off some fierce ejaculation, one of us\r\nwould ask, \"Hello! Are you two still at it,\" or, \"How are you and\r\nyour friend these times, Preble?\"\r\n\r\nIn a few minutes it was over, but that creature in his fury seemed\r\nto have inspired himself with lock-jaw, for his teeth were so driven\r\nin and double-locked, that I had to pry the jaws apart before the\r\nhand was free.\r\n\r\nThe Weasel may now be seen in the American Museum, and Preble in the\r\nAgricultural Department at Washington, the latter none the worse.\r\n\r\nSo wore away the month, the last night came, a night of fireside\r\njoy at home (for was it not Hallowe'en?), and our celebration took\r\nthe form of washing, shaving, mending clothes, in preparation for\r\nour landing in the morning.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLVIII\r\n\r\nTHE END\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAll that night of Hallowe'en, a Partridge drummed near my untented\r\ncouch on the balsam boughs. What a glorious sound of woods and life\r\ntriumphant it seemed; and why did he drum at night? Simply because\r\nhe had more joy than the short fall day gave him time to express.\r\nHe seemed to be beating our march of victory, for were we not in\r\ntriumph coming home? The gray firstlight came through the trees\r\nand showed us lying each in his blanket, covered with leaves, like\r\nbabes in the woods. The gray Jays came wailing through the gloom,\r\na faroff Cock-of-the-Pines was trumpeting in the lovely, unplagued\r\nautumn woods; it seemed as though all the very best things in the\r\nland were assembled and the bad things all left out, so that our\r\nfinal memories should have no evil shade.\r\n\r\nThe scene comes brightly back again, the sheltering fir-clad shore,\r\nthe staunch canoe skimming the river's tranquil reach, the water\r\nsmiling round her bow, as we push from this, the last of full five\r\nhundred camps.\r\n\r\nThe dawn fog lifts, the river sparkles in the sun, we round the last\r\nof a thousand headlands. The little frontier town of the Landing\r\nswings into view once more--what a metropolis it seems to us now!--The\r\nAnn Seton lands at the spot where six months ago she had entered\r\nthe water. Now in quick succession come the thrills of the larger\r\nlife--the letters from home, the telegraph office, the hearty\r\ngood-bye to the brave riverboys, and my long canoe-ride is over.\r\n\r\nI had held in my heart the wanderlust till it swept me away, and\r\nsent me afar on the back trail of the north wind; I have lived in\r\nthe mighty boreal forest, with its Red-men, its Buffalo, its Moose,\r\nand its Wolves; I have seen the Great Lone Land with its endless\r\nplains and prairies that do not know the face of man or the crack\r\nof a rifle; I have been with its countless lakes that re-echo nothing\r\nbut the wail and yodel of the Loons, or the mournful music of the\r\nArctic Wolf. I have wandered on the plains of the Musk-ox, the\r\nhome of the Snowbird and the Caribou. These were the things I had\r\nburned to do. Was I content? Content!! Is a man ever content with\r\na single sip of joy long-dreamed of?\r\n\r\nFour years have gone since then. The wanderlust was not stifled any\r\nmore than a fire is stifled by giving it air. I have taken into\r\nmy heart a longing, given shape to an ancient instinct. Have I not\r\nfound for myself a kingdom and become a part of it? My reason and\r\nmy heart say, \"Go back to see it all.\" Grant only this, that I\r\ngather again the same brave men that manned my frail canoe,\r\nand as sure as life and strength continue I shall go.",
