OLIVER.\r\n\r\n\r\nABC's OF SCIENCE\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\nTHE SUPREME POWER OF NATURE\r\n\r\n1.\r\nSupreme power of Nature is comprised of all.\r\n\r\n2.\r\nIt may be divided into three parts:  Mineral, Vegetable, and Animal.\r\n\r\n3.\r\nMineral is comprised of Mineral Matter and Mineral Magnetism.\r\n\r\n4.\r\nAnimal is comprised of Animal Matter and Animal Magnetism.\r\n\r\n5.\r\nVegetable is comprised of Vegetable Matter and Vegetable Magnetism.\r\n\r\n6.\r\nEach of the foregoing have life, and by cooperating with each other\r\nproduce life that flourishes.\r\n\r\n7.\r\nThere being as many different kinds of Magnetism as there are matter\r\nwhich is beyond the strength of human to classify.\r\n\r\n8.\r\nThe supreme power of Nature had no beginning so it has no end; its\r\nlife is indestructible.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Figures:  Five line-drawings, captioned as follows.  \"Comet of 1881,\r\nthe year Mother Shipton prophecied the Earth to come to an end.\"\r\n\"Comet of 1744.\"  \"Comet of 1857.\"  \"Biela's comet discovered in 1827.\r\nreturned at intervals of 6 1/2 years.  In 1846 it returned split,\r\nreturned in 1852, but never appeared since.\"  \"Saturn.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\nASTRONOMY\r\n\r\n(The word \"vapor\" used in general for water, ice, atmosphere, etc.)\r\n\r\n1.\r\nSpace without beginning or end, filled with unmaterial and material\r\nlife.  The material is in motion by the currents of unmaterial life.\r\n\r\n2.\r\nThe material is in perfect bodies, imperfect bodies, and\r\nunconcentrated material.\r\n\r\n3.\r\nPerfect bodies group into constellation, called sun's planets,\r\nplanetoids, and moons.\r\n\r\n4.\r\nImperfect bodies are comets, called periodic and parabolic comets.\r\n\r\n5.\r\nUnconcentrated material called Milky Ways, and rings such as are\r\naround Saturn.\r\n\r\n6.\r\nThe unmaterial life currents run in every conceivable manner.  I will\r\ncall the currents carrying constellation sun currents, planet\r\ncurrents, planetoid currents, moon currents, and comet currents,\r\nrespectively.\r\n\r\nMilky ways eddys.\r\n\r\n7.\r\nSaturn is the only body we know which has an unconcentrated obsequious\r\nattendant. Such rings may appear around constellations, planets,\r\nmoons, etc.\r\n\r\nThese rings can be accounted for in two ways,--first, the material\r\nnever being concentrated; second, by two or more bodies coming\r\ntogether and throwing the bodies into atoms.\r\n\r\n8.\r\nSuck, or Nebula, currents form in the Milky ways (the same as two or\r\nmore currents of air coming together and making a whirlwind), which\r\nconcentrates the material into bodies, thus forming constellations and\r\ncomets; also rings such as are around Saturn.\r\n\r\nIf a constellation is formed its current is called sun current, and\r\nhere it continues to whirl with all its subordinate currents, planet,\r\nplanetoid, and moon.\r\n\r\n9.\r\nComets are caused by sun currents' pressure forcing the suck currents\r\nat a great speed, and forces the comet current to pass through sun\r\ncurrents.  Some comets pass in and out of their sun currents at\r\nregular intervals and are called periodic, i.e., its orbit is an\r\nellipse.\r\n\r\nComets that are parabolic will never return to their starting point\r\nand travel wild.\r\n\r\n10.\r\n\r\nBodies may be destroyed by suck currents carrying bodies in collision\r\nwith each other; if the bodies are equal size, will throw the material\r\ninto atoms.  If a small and large body come in collision the small\r\nbody will bury itself in the greater.  Bodies thrown into atoms, the\r\natoms may continue to be carried by its respective current (as rings\r\naround Saturn), or the atoms may be forced beyond its current and pass\r\nas shooting stars to other bodies or milky ways.\r\n\r\n11.\r\nNebula is the suck current in the process of condensing material into\r\nbodies.  Can be seen in Milky Way with naked eve.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Figures:  two line drawings, captioned as follows.  \"The solar\r\nsystem.\"  \"The sun.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\nTHE SOLAR SYSTEM\r\n\r\n1.\r\nThe Solar System is better known to us, as the earth on which we\r\nflourish belongs to it.\r\n\r\n2.\r\nThe System is comprised of one sun (star), eight major planets,\r\nMercury, Venus, Earth, and one satellite, Mars and two satellites,\r\nJupiter and seven satellites, Saturn, its rings and ten satellites,\r\nUranus and four satellites, Neptune and one satellite, and some 600\r\nplanetoids, varying in size from 600 miles in diameter to mere rocks.\r\n\r\n3.\r\nThe sun's diameter is 866,000 miles.  Rotates every 606 hours.  The\r\nlength of time its current carries the sun over its orbit is unknown.\r\nThe sun remains a melted mass; its vibration is maintained; has but\r\nlittle vapor and its theme reflected on the surface of its obsequious\r\nattendants which gives them heat and light.\r\n\r\nDark spots caused by vapor becoming concentrated to the sun's surface;\r\nthese spots change.\r\n\r\n4.\r\nMercury, the smallest major planet, also the closest to the sun.  It\r\nis carried over its orbit about 36,000,000 miles from the sun, which\r\nrequires 88 days to complete its course, and rotates once every 24\r\nhours and 5 minutes.  Its diameter is 3,000 miles and it has a\r\nsuitable amount of vapor for animals and vegetables to flourish.\r\n\r\n5.\r\nVenus has the brightest lustre of our planets which is caused from\r\nenormous amount of vapor.  It is carried over its orbit at about\r\n67,000,000 miles from the sun, which requires 224 7/10 days to\r\ncomplete its course.  Rotates once every 23 hours and 21 minutes.\r\nDiameter, 7,700 miles.\r\n\r\n6.\r\nThe earth is carried over its orbit; main distance being 93,000,000\r\nmiles from the sun, which requires one year to complete its course,\r\nwhich is 680,000,000 miles:\r\n\r\n                                   MILES\r\n     Earth's diameter              8,000\r\n     Greater or equatorial         7,925\r\n     Less or polar                 7,899\r\n         Difference on comparison     26\r\n\r\nThe earth rotates once every 23 hours, 56 minutes, and 4 seconds; has\r\none satellite, which is carried over its orbit at a distance of\r\n238,850 miles from the earth.  Its diameter is 2,160 miles.  The moon\r\ncompletes its orbit in 29 days, 12 hours, 44 minutes, and 2 seconds.\r\nIts currents touch the earth and cause the tide; also affects some\r\nplants of the phenomena verita; these plants are also affected by the\r\nsun.\r\n\r\nMany years after the earth's material began to flourish, a small body\r\n(whose crust was cooled) came in contact with the earth; this caused\r\nthe earth's crust to crack almost from pole to pole and formed North\r\nand South America.  The eruptions in Europe, Asia, and Africa were\r\ngreatly scattered.  Australian soil is deficient in phosphorus, which\r\nshows it is foreign and represents the small body which did not\r\nentirely bury itself.  This caused some of the earth's land surface to\r\nbe below the sea level; also caused the earth's axis to change at a\r\nvery slow rate of about 77 yards per year.  This will require many\r\nthousands of years for the North Pole to become the South Pole.  For\r\nmany years the Polar star appeared \"fixed\" at the earth's north axis.\r\n\r\n7.\r\nMars is carried around the sun by its planet current at a distance of\r\n140,000,000 miles, which requires 687 days, and rotates every 24\r\nhours, 37 minutes, and 22 1/2 seconds.  Diameter, 4,200 miles.  Mars\r\nhas two satellites and is not abundant in vapor which causes its\r\nreddish appearance, therefore vegetation and animals are scanty.\r\n\r\n8.\r\nJupiter is the largest major planet.  It makes a great jump from the\r\nsun of 483,000,000 miles, carried by its planet current to complete\r\nits orbit in 12 years.  Rotates every 9 hours, 55 minutes, and 37\r\nseconds.  Diameter, 88,000 miles; has seven satellites.  The climate\r\nhas a very even temperature due to its fast rotation.\r\n\r\n9.\r\nSaturn, the beauty of the skies, carried by its planet current around\r\nthe sun at its main distance of 883,000,000 miles (a greater distance\r\nof 400,000,000 miles than Jupiter) which requires about 29 1/2 years.\r\nRotates once every 10 hours, 14 minutes, and 23 seconds.  Diameter,\r\n75,000 miles.  It has ten satellites and three rings of unconcentrated\r\nmaterial.  The cape ring is about 9,000 miles across, the other two\r\nabout 16,000 each.  Diameter of rings about 170,000 miles, which makes\r\nthe rings very close to the surface.\r\n\r\n10.\r\nUranus is carried by its planet current around the sun at a great\r\ndistance of 1,778,000,000 miles, which requires about 84 years.  Rate\r\nof rotation unknown.  Diameter, 31,000 miles.  It has four satellites.\r\n\r\n11.\r\nNeptune is the farthest from the sun.  Its main distance being\r\n2,792,000,000 miles; carried by its planet current over its orbit once\r\nin 164 years, 9 months.  Diameter, 37,000 miles.  Period of rotation\r\nunknown.  Has one satellite.  At Neptune we haven't taken a step but\r\nour next neighbor is across the divide.  Let us have a fairy dream and\r\ntravel from the sun to Neptune in a straight or direct course at the\r\nrate of 1,000,000 miles an hour; it would take us 116 1/3 days to\r\nreach Neptune.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Figure:  Line drawing, captioned \"The solar system.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\nACROSS THE DIVIDE\r\n\r\n1.\r\nCrossing the divide (Abyss) we encounter other systems of about\r\n25,000,000,000, or the first magnitude.  Our most powerful glass\r\nreaches the 16th.\r\n\r\nMagnitude is very uneven and irregular, and beyond this there is no\r\nend.\r\n\r\n2.\r\nMany constellations have more than one sun, while others are double,\r\nquadruple, and multiple.  It is estimated a brilliant star, and can be\r\nseen; of these over a million have been catalogued and only about 25\r\nwhose distance have been measured.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\nFLOURISHMENT OF THE EARTH\r\n\r\n1.\r\nThe earth reached its state of concentration, and the vapor in great\r\nclouds enveloped the heavier substance.  The earth being heaved up by\r\nvolcanoes (caused by the vapor coming in contact with the heated\r\nmaterial); as the vapor reached its state, rain fell on the earth\r\ncrust, and thus rivers, lakes, and oceans were formed.\r\n\r\n2.\r\nHere animal and vegetable matter began to flourish.\r\n\r\n3.\r\nGreat deposits of protoplasm became concentrated over the earth's\r\nsurface; from the deposits sprang all kinds of vegetables and animals\r\nthat flourish, and many more families than inhabit the earth to-day\r\nbecame extinct.\r\n\r\n4.\r\nVegetable matter began to flourish as its semen became concentrated,\r\nlikewise animal matter.  (This takes place to-day in different ways,\r\nprincipally in Marine varites.  See Chap. I, par. 6.)\r\n\r\n5.\r\nReproductions in all families that flourish; some families mix and\r\ntheir offspring will not reproduce.  (Life cannot be destroyed, but\r\nflourishment can.)\r\n\r\n6.\r\nMan came from deposits of protoplasm (semen) as is produced for\r\nreproduction of man to-day.  The deposits were of different kinds;\r\neach deposit brought forth its own branch of humanity, these branches\r\nbeing of different type and tongue.  Later the tongue of one branch\r\nbecame learned by the other.  From the different original tongues will\r\ngive us a good estimate of deposits in number.\r\n\r\n7.\r\nBabies were nourished in the protoplasm deposits the same as they are\r\nin their mother's womb.  This nourishment came from the abundance of\r\nalbumen which accompanied the semen in concentrating.  As the babies\r\nmatured they broke the crust of the deposit of protoplasm and put\r\nforth their heads and breathed the air; their bodies still remained in\r\nthe albumen until they gained strength to feed themselves on the\r\nalbumen.  Here the babies broke the cord (navel cord) that brought\r\nnourishment into their bodies, as in the womb of a mother, and crawled\r\naround over the crust of the deposit where they came, feeding on its\r\ncrust by putting it into their mouths. The babe has not forgotten it\r\nyet, as everything he gets that he can handle goes to his mouth.  He\r\nlearned to walk and talk to his brothers and sisters, and composed a\r\nlanguage of their own.  Here manhood and womanhood is reached.\r\n\r\n8.\r\nAll animals came in like manner, but without a fluent language.\r\n\r\n9.\r\n\r\nVegetable matter flourished and the earth is inhabited. All bodies\r\nthat have atmosphere are inhabited.  Atmosphere is vaporized\r\nprotoplasm.\r\n\r\n10.\r\nTen of the principal materials that produce flourishment are carbon,\r\nhydrogen, oxygen, phosphorus, potassium, nitrogen, sulphur, calcium,\r\niron and magnesium; protoplasm contains everything; chemists have not\r\nbeen able to determine and classify protoplasm.  (See Chap. I, par.\r\n7.)\r\n\r\n11.\r\nHumanity varied much in size.  The giant tribe (such as the petrified\r\nCardiff Giant) has long been extinct.  Men of this type weighed 500\r\npounds and more, measured nearly 12 feet in height, while our midgets\r\nmeasure under 2 feet.\r\n\r\n12.\r\nHermaphrodites exist in all material that flourishes.  Malformation.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\nANIMAL MAGNETISM\r\n\r\n1.\r\nEvery animal has its own magnetism which is its source of strength and\r\nintelligence.  The glands, nerves, and ducts are batteries, ducts and\r\nglands storage batteries, the nerves motive and sensation (or\r\nintelligence).  The brain is the principal battery of sensation (or\r\nintelligence), while the heart is the principal motive battery.\r\n\r\n2.\r\nThe child begins to train himself to make use of his limbs, first by\r\nswinging his arms and legs, second by creeping, third by walking.\r\nNote a child feeding itself, how unsteady he is in getting his food to\r\nhis mouth; sometimes his spoon misses his mouth and the food is\r\nspilled, for which he usually receives a slap, although he has\r\ndisplayed all his energy in getting his food in his mouth.  Next we\r\nfind him a trained athlete and skilled laborer, capable of applying\r\nhimself to most anything he cares to do.\r\n\r\n3.\r\nBut little attention is paid to the training of animal magnetism.  Any\r\none with nerves in his teeth can concentrate magnetism in the teeth,\r\nso it can be easily felt, also the lips; by training the magnetism it\r\ncan be concentrated in any part of the body.  This takes constant\r\npractice and could be used when one has any disability by\r\nconcentrating the magnetism in the disabled part, causing the blood to\r\ncirculate more freely at the point where the magnetism is\r\nconcentrated, and thus improving the disabled part.  The osteologist\r\ndoes this by massage, the real faith cure man by concentrating his\r\nmagnetism on the patient, the practitioner uses medicine and drugs,\r\neach having their own magnetism, etc.  Accordingly many diseases are\r\ncontagious by people becoming inoculated by mild magnetism which comes\r\nfrom some kind of matter.  (See Chap. I, par. 7.)\r\n\r\n4.\r\nThe hypnotist or mesmerist gains control of his opponents through\r\nanimal magnetism and controls every movement.  The nerves cease to act\r\nand the hypnotist is boss.  The patient can be made to exert great\r\nstrength and pass dangerous points without falling.  A hypnotist or\r\nmesmerist is invariably in poor health and flesh.  This is caused by\r\nthe over-taxation of his own nerves and ducts.\r\n\r\n6.\r\nAnimal magnetism can he used like wireless telegraphy.  Miss Helen\r\nKellar is one of the best known for telepathy.  She was born blind,\r\nalso deaf and dumb.  She is a great linguist and well educated.\r\n\r\n7.\r\nThe dumb animals in their wild state use telepathy much when\r\nencountering danger; their keen scent of the deer, horse, etc.,\r\nenables them to determine the direction of the enemy.\r\n\r\n8.\r\nPredestination is cultivated and in most instances comes true.  I\r\nobserved this in the case of William McKinley, martyred President of\r\nthe United States of America, who said he wanted to follow in the\r\nfootsteps of James A. Garfield, also martyred President.  Let us see\r\nhow nearly he came following in his footsteps:  Born in the same\r\nlocality, President of the same country, each supported a platform of\r\ngood currency, each assassinated in the same month, and in the seat of\r\nthe Presidency.  Both died a lingering death; the difference in the\r\nlength of time of their flourishment was 8 months and 7 days.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Figures:  Photographs of William McKinley and James A. Garfield.]\r\n\r\n\r\n9.\r\nNext observe the old in their feebleness and we see these well trained\r\nhands tremble; the gland ducts and nerves are withering, the animal\r\nmagnetism is weakening, which renders them childish .\r\n\r\n10.\r\nThe ducts, glands, and nerves throw off their magnetism in many\r\ndifferent ways, in exertion, fright, fear, anguish, discontent,\r\nhappiness, kindness, loveliness, desire, etc.\r\n\r\nDr. T. B. Robertson discovered that Tethelin (located in the pituitary\r\nbody at the base of the brain) produces the growth of the body.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\nMISCELLANEOUS\r\n\r\n1.\r\nLightning is caused by the friction of vapor, which is at a suitable\r\ntemperature.  Thus two or more currents of air coming together will\r\ncause lightning, as the friction concentrates the electricity, and as\r\nthere is no conductor the heavy voltage flies usually toward the\r\nnearest conductor.  This voltage is so great that it explodes the air.\r\nThe air coming together again produces a great vibration, called\r\nthunder.\r\n\r\n2.\r\nAurora Borealis.  The outer circle around the earth represents\r\natmosphere.  The sun current carries it far from the earth's surface.\r\nAt the north, when the sun's reflection strikes the earth's crust in\r\nsuch a manner, its reflection will be seen in the atmosphere at a\r\ngreat height, called Northern Lights.  This is mostly seen in\r\nNovember, December, and January.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Figure:  Uncaptioned line drawing (accompanying the paragraph above)\r\nof the Earth's orbit about the sun.]\r\n\r\n\r\n3.\r\nThe museum of Alexandria was established about 400 years B.C., for the\r\npurpose of restoring science that had been lost thousands of years\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\nThe cultivation of knowledge by experiment, observation, and\r\nmathematical discussions:  this was the birth of a science of to-day.\r\nThe library contained many thousands of volumes of books, but was\r\ndestroyed by Cyril; a girl in charge of the library by the name of\r\nHypatia was brutally killed and the flesh was scraped from her bones\r\nwith sea shells.  This occurred in 414 A.D.\r\n\r\nAlexander died at Babylon 323 B.C.\r\n\r\nChina, Mesopotamia, and India had made astronomical observations at\r\nthis early date.  Most of these learnings were destroyed.  Brono,\r\nIsaac Newton, Brably, and some few others, promoted science by their\r\ndiscoveries of what is to-day.  \"Good Will to man.\"",
