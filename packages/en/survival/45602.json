We shall\r\nfollow the ocean through all its extent and windings, enumerating at\r\nthe same time all the mediterranean seas, and endeavour to distinguish\r\nthem from those which should be only called bays, or gulphs, and lakes.\r\n\r\nThe sea which washes the western coasts of France forms a gulph between\r\nSpain and Britain; this gulph, which mariners call the Bay of Biscay,\r\nis very open, and the point which projects farthest inland is between\r\nBayonne and St. Sebastian; another great projection is between Rochelle\r\nand Rochefort: this gulph begins at Cape Ortegal, and ends at Brest,\r\nwhere a strait commences between the south point of Britain and Cape\r\nLizard. This strait, which at first is very large, forms a small gulph\r\nin Normandy, the most projecting point of which is at Auranche; it\r\ncontinues pretty broad until it comes to the channel at the foot of\r\nCalais, where it is very narrow; afterwards it grows broader on a\r\nsudden, and ends between the Texel and the coast of England at Norwich;\r\nat the Texel it forms a small mediterranean sea, called _Zuyder-zee_,\r\nand many other great canals, which are not very deep.\r\n\r\nAfter that the ocean forms a great gulph called the German Ocean; it\r\nbegins at the northern point of Scotland, runs along the eastern\r\ncoast of Scotland and England as far as Norwich, from thence to the\r\nTexel, along the coasts of Holland and Germany, Jutland, Norway, and\r\nabove Bergen. This gulph might be taken for a mediterranean sea,\r\nbecause the Orkney islands partly shut up its opening, and seem\r\nto be directed as if they were a continuation of the mountains of\r\nNorway. It forms a large strait, which begins at the southern point\r\nof Norway, and continues very broad to the Island of Zetland, where\r\nit narrows all at once, and forms between the coasts of Sweden, the\r\nislands of Denmark and Jutland, four small straits; after which it\r\nwidens to a small gulph, the most projecting point of which is at\r\nLubec: from thence it continues pretty broad to the southern extremity\r\nof Sweden, when it grows broader and broader, and forms the Baltic\r\nSea, which is a mediterranean, extending from south to north near 300\r\nleagues, comprehending the gulph of Bothnia, which is in fact only a\r\ncontinuation of it. This sea has two more gulphs, that of Livonia,\r\nwhose most projecting point is near Mittau and Riga, and that of\r\nFinland, which is an arm of the Baltic, extending between Livonia and\r\nFinland to Petersburgh, and communicating with the lake Ladoga, and\r\neven with the lake Onega, which communicates by the river Onega to the\r\nWhite Sea. All this extent of water, which forms the Baltic Sea, the\r\ngulphs of Bothnia, Finland, and Livonia, must be looked upon as one\r\ngreat lake, supported by a great number of rivers which it receives,\r\nas the Oder, the Vistula, the Niemen, the Droine, in Germany and\r\nPoland; other rivers in Livonia and Finland; others still greater,\r\nwhich come from Lapland, Tornea, the Calis, Lula, Pithea, Uma, and\r\nmany others that come from Sweden. These rivers, which are very large,\r\nare more than 40, including the rivers they receive, which cannot fail\r\nof producing a quantity of water sufficient to support the Baltic.\r\nBesides, this sea has no flux nor reflux, although it is very narrow\r\nand very salt. If we consider also the bearing of the country, and\r\nthe number of lakes and morasses in Finland and Sweden, we shall be\r\ninclined to look on it not as a sea, but as a great lake formed by the\r\nabundance of waters from the adjacent lands, and which has forced a\r\npassage near Denmark into the ocean, where in fact, according to the\r\naccount of mariners, they still continue to flow.\r\n\r\nFrom the beginning of the gulph which forms the German Sea, and which\r\nterminates above Bergen, the ocean follows the coasts of Norway,\r\nSwedish Lapland, North Lapland, and Muscovy Lapland, at the eastern\r\npart of which it forms a large strait, which borders a mediterranean\r\ncalled the White Sea, which may be likewise regarded as a great lake;\r\nfor it receives 12 or 13 rivers, all very considerable, and which\r\nare more than sufficient to support it; its water is but a little\r\nsalt. Besides, in many parts it is very near communicating with the\r\nBaltic Sea; it has even a real one with the gulph of Finland, for,\r\nby ascending the river Onega, we come to a lake of the same name;\r\nfrom this lake Onega there are two rivers of communication with the\r\nlake Ladoga; this last communicates by a large arm with the gulph of\r\nFinland; and there are many parts in Swedish Lapland, the waters of\r\nwhich run almost indifferently either into the White Sea, or the gulphs\r\nof Bothnia and Finland; and all this country being full of lakes and\r\nmorasses, the Baltic and White Seas seem to be the receptacles of its\r\nwaters, and which afterwards discharge themselves into the Frozen and\r\nGerman Sea.\r\n\r\nQuitting the White Sea, and coasting the island of Candenos and the\r\nnorthern coasts of Russia, the ocean forms a small arm in the land at\r\nthe mouth of the river Petzora. This arm, which is about 40 leagues\r\nlong, by 8 or 10 broad, is rather a mass of water formed by the river\r\nthan a gulph of the sea, and also has but little saltness. The land\r\nthere forms a projecting cape, terminated by the small islands of\r\nMaurice and of Orange; and between this promontory and the lands which\r\nborder the Strait of Waigat to the south, there is a small gulph about\r\n30 leagues depth inland. This gulph belongs to the ocean, and is not\r\nformed by the land waters. We afterwards meet with Waigat's Strait,\r\nwhich is nearly under the 70th degree of north latitude. This strait is\r\nnot more than 8 or 10 leagues long, and communicates with the sea which\r\nwaters the northern coasts of Siberia. As this strait is shut up by the\r\nice the greatest part of the year, it is very difficult to get into\r\nthe sea beyond it. The passage has been attempted in vain by a great\r\nnumber of navigators, and those who fortunately passed it have left\r\nus no exact charts of that sea, which they have termed the Pacific\r\nOcean. All that appears by the most recent charts, and by Senex's\r\nglobe of 1739, is, that this sea might be entirely mediterranean, and\r\nnot communicating with the great sea of Tartary, for it appears to\r\nbe enclosed and bounded on the south by the country of the Samoides,\r\nwhich is at present well known, and which extends from the Straits of\r\nWaigat to the river Jenisca; on the east it is bounded by Jelmorland,\r\non the west by Nova Zembla; and although we are not acquainted with the\r\nextent of this sea to the north and north-east, yet as there does not\r\nappear any interruption of the lands, there is great probability of\r\nits being only a mediterranean, and bounded by land on that side: what\r\nindeed proves this is, that by leaving Waigat's Strait you may coast\r\nNova-Zembla all along its western and northern coasts as far as Cape\r\nDesire; that after having past this cape, keeping along the coast to\r\nthe east of Nova Zembla, you arrive at a small gulph, which is about\r\nthe 75th country of Jelmorland was discovered in 1664, which is only a\r\nfew leagues distant from Nova Zembla, so that the only land which has\r\nnot yet been discovered is a small spot near this little gulph; and\r\nthis part is perhaps not thirty leagues long; so that if the Pacific\r\nSea communicated with the ocean it must be at this little gulph, which\r\nis the only way by which they can join; and as this small gulph is\r\nin the 75th degree, even if the communication should exist, we must\r\nalways keep five degrees towards the north to gain the great sea. It\r\nis evident, therefore, that if we would acquire the northern route to\r\nChina, it would be much better to pass by the north of Nova Zembla, at\r\nthe 77th or 78th degree, where the sea is more open, and has less ice,\r\nthan to attempt the road through the icy strait of Waigat, with the\r\nuncertainty of getting out of this sea, which there is so much reason\r\nto believe mediterranean.\r\n\r\nBy following, therefore, the ocean along the coasts of Nova Zembla\r\nand Jelmorland, these lands are discoverable as far as the mouth of\r\nChotanga, which is about the 73d degree, beyond which there is an\r\nunknown coast of about 200 leagues: we have only an account of them\r\nfrom the Muscovites, who have travelled by land into those climates;\r\nthey state the country to be uninterrupted, have marked out the rivers\r\nin their charts, and called the people _populi palati_. This interval\r\nof coasts, still unknown, extends from the mouth of Chotanga to that of\r\nKauvoina, in the 66th degree of latitude; the ocean there forms a bay,\r\nwhose most projecting point in land is at the mouth of the Len, which\r\nis a very considerable river. This bay is very open, belongs to the\r\nTartarian sea, and is called the Linchidolin, where the Muscovites have\r\na whale fishery.\r\n\r\nFrom the mouth of the Len we may follow the coasts of Tartary more\r\nthan 500 leagues towards the east, to a peninsula inhabited by the\r\nSchelates. This is the most northern extremity of Tartary, and is\r\nsituate about the 72d degree of latitude. In this 500 leagues the\r\nocean makes no interruption by bays nor arms, only a considerable\r\nelbow from the peninsula of the Schelates to the mouth of the river\r\nKorvinea. This point of land also forms the eastern extremity of the\r\nold continent, and whose western is at Cape North in Lapland; so that\r\nthe old continent has about 1700 leagues northern coasts, comprehending\r\nthe sinuosities of the bays, from Cape North in Lapland to the farthest\r\npoint of land belonging to the Schelates, and about 1100 leagues in a\r\nstraight line.\r\n\r\nLet us now take a view of the eastern coasts of the old continent,\r\nbeginning at the farthest point of land which the Schelates inhabit,\r\nand descending towards the equator. The ocean at first forms an elbow\r\nbetween the country of the Schelates, and the land inhabited by the\r\npeople called Tschutschi, which projects a considerable way into the\r\nsea. To the south of this island it forms a small bay, called the Bay\r\nof Suctoikret, and afterwards another smaller bay, which projects like\r\nan arm 40 or 50 miles into Kamtschatka; the ocean then enters into\r\nthe land by a long strait, filled with many small Islands between the\r\nsouthern point of Kamtschatka and the northern point of Jesso, and\r\nforms a great mediterranean, which it is proper we should now trace\r\nthroughout. The first is the sea of Kamtschatka, in which is a very\r\nconsiderable island, called Amour, or Love Island. This sea has an arm\r\nto the north-east; but this arm, and the sea of Kamtschatka itself,\r\nmight possibly be, at least in part, formed by the rivers, which run\r\ntherein, from the lands of Kamtschatka and from Tartary. Be this as it\r\nwill, the sea of Kamtschatka communicates with the sea of Corea, which\r\nmakes the second part of this mediterranean; and all this sea, which\r\nis more than 600 leagues in length, is bounded upon the west and north\r\nby Corea and Tartary, and on the east and south by Kamtschatka, Jesso,\r\nand Japan, without having any other communication with the ocean than\r\nthat of the fore-mentioned strait, for it is not certain whether that\r\nwhich is set down in some maps between Japan and Jesso really exists;\r\nand even if this strait does exist, the sea of Kamtschatka and Corea\r\nwill still be regarded as forming a great mediterranean, divided from\r\nthe ocean on every side, and could not be taken for a bay, for it has\r\nno direct communication with the ocean by its southern strait, but with\r\nthe sea of China, which is rather a mediterranean than a gulph of the\r\nocean.\r\n\r\nIt has been observed in the preceding article, that the sea has a\r\nconstant motion from east to west; and that consequently the great\r\nPacific Sea made continual efforts against the eastern countries;\r\nan attentive inspection of the globe will confirm the consequences\r\nwhich we have drawn from this observation; for from Kamtschatka to\r\nNew Britain, discovered in 1700 by Dampier, and which is the 4th or\r\n5th degree in the south latitude, the ocean appears to have washed\r\naway part of the land on these coasts for upwards of 400 leagues, and\r\nconsequently the eastern bounds of the old continent formerly extended\r\nmuch farther than at present; for it is remarkable, that New Britain\r\nand Kamtschatka, which are the most projecting lands towards the east,\r\nare under the same meridian. All countries have their greatest extent\r\nfrom north to south. Kamtschatka reaches at least 160 leagues from\r\nnorth to south, and that point which is washed by the Pacific Sea on\r\nthe east, and on the other by the mediterranean sea above mentioned, is\r\ndivided in the direction, from north to south by a chain of mountains.\r\n\r\nAfter these the lands of Jesso and Japan form another extent of\r\nland, whose direction is also north and south, extending upwards of\r\n400 leagues, between the Great Sea and that of Corea. The chain of\r\nmountains of Jesso, and of Japan, cannot fail of being directed from\r\nnorth to south, since these lands, which are 400 leagues in this\r\ndirection, are not more than 50 or 60 from east to west. Therefore\r\nthe lands of Kamtschatka, Jesso, and the eastern part of Japan, must\r\nbe regarded as contiguous, and directed from north to south. Still\r\npursuing the same direction, after having passed Cape Ava at Japan,\r\nwe meet with the island of Barnevelt, and three other islands, which\r\nare placed in the direction of north and south, and extend about 100\r\nleagues. We afterwards meet with three other islands, called the\r\nislands of Callanos, then the Ladrones, which are fourteen or fifteen\r\nin number, all placed in the same direction from north to south,\r\nand all together occupying a space of more than 300 leagues in this\r\ndirection, by so trifling a breadth, that its greatest does not exceed\r\nseven or eight leagues from east to west. It therefore appears to me\r\nthat Kamtschatka, Jesso, eastern Japan, the islands of Barnevelt, the\r\nCallanos, and the Ladrones, are only the same chain of mountains, and\r\nthe remains of an old country, which the ocean has at one time covered\r\nand gradually retired from. All these countries in fact appear to be\r\nonly mountains, and the islands to be their points or peaks, while\r\nthe low lands are covered with the ocean. What is related in Lettres\r\nEdifiantes, appears, to be true, and that in fact a quantity of islands\r\nhave been discovered, called the new Philippine Islands, and that their\r\nposition is really such as is given by Father Gobien; and it cannot be\r\ndoubted but that the most eastern of these islands are a continuation\r\nof the chain of mountains which forms the Ladrones, for these eleven\r\neastern islands are all placed in the same direction from north to\r\nsouth, occupying a space of more than 200 leagues in length, the\r\nbroadest of which is not more than 7 or 8 leagues from east to west.\r\n\r\nBut if these conjectures are thought too presumptuous, on account of\r\nthe great intervals between the islands bordering on Cape Ava, Japan,\r\nand the Callanos, and between these islands and the Ladrones, and\r\nbetween the Ladrones and the new Philippines, the first of which is\r\nin fact about 160 leagues, the second 50 or 60, and the third near\r\n120, I shall answer that the chains of mountains often extend much\r\nfarther under the waters of the sea, and that these intervals are\r\nsmall in comparison of the extent of land which these mountains in\r\nthe above direction present, which is 1100 leagues, computing them\r\nfrom the interior part of Kamtschatka. In short, if we wholly reject\r\nthis idea, as to the quantity of land the ocean must have gained on\r\nthe eastern coasts of the continent, and on that suit of mountains,\r\nstill it must be allowed that Kamtschatka, Jesso, Japan, the islands\r\nBonga, Tanaxima, those of Great Lequeo, King's Island, Formosa, Vaif,\r\nBasha, Babuyane, Lucca, Mindano, Gilolo, &c. and lastly, Guinea,\r\nwhich extends to New Britain, and is situate under the same meridian\r\nas Kamtschatka, do not form a continuation of land of more than 2200\r\nleagues, interrupted only by small intervals, the greatest of which\r\nperhaps is not more than 20 leagues, so that the ocean has formed in\r\nthe lands of the eastern continent a great bay, which commences at\r\nKamtschatka and ends at New Britain. This bay is interspersed with many\r\nislands, and has every appearance of having been gained from the land,\r\nconsequently we may suppose, with some probability, that the ocean, by\r\nits constant motion from east to west, has by degrees acquired this\r\nextent on the eastern continent, and has formed mediterraneans, such\r\nas Kamtschatka, Corea, China, and perhaps all the Archipelago; for the\r\nearth and sea are there so blended that it evidently appears to be an\r\ninundated country, of which we only see the eminences and high lands,\r\nwhile the lower are hid under the waters of the ocean. This supposition\r\nappears to be in some measure confirmed by the water being more shallow\r\nthan in other seas, and the innumerable islands resembling the tops of\r\nmountains.\r\n\r\nIf we particularly examine these seas, we shall find the sea of China\r\nforms a very deep bay in its northern part, which commences at the\r\nisland of Fungma, and terminates at the frontier of the province of\r\nPekin, about 50 leagues distance from that capital of the Chinese\r\nempire. This bay, in its most interior and narrowest part, is called\r\nthe Gulph of Changi. It is very probable that this gulph, and a part of\r\nthe sea of China, have been formed by the ocean, which has submerged\r\nall the ancient country, of which only the islands before-mentioned\r\nare now to be seen. In this southern part are the bays of Tonquin and\r\nSiam, near which is the peninsula of Malacco, formed by a long chain\r\nof mountains, whose direction is from north to south, and the Andaman\r\nislands, another chain of mountains in the same direction, and which\r\nappear to be only a succession of the mountains of Sumatra.\r\n\r\nThe ocean afterwards forms the great Gulph of Bengal, in which we may\r\nremark, that the peninsula of Indus forms a concave curb towards the\r\neast, nearly like the great bay of the eastern continent, which seems\r\nto have been also produced by the same motion of the ocean from east\r\nto west. In this peninsula are the mountains of Gates, which have a\r\ndirection from north to south, as far as Cape Comorin, and the Island\r\nof Ceylon seems to have been separated from this part of the continent.\r\nThe Maldiva islands are only another chain of mountains, whose\r\ndirection is also the same. After these follows the Arabian Gulph,\r\nwhich sends out four arms into the country; the two greatest on the\r\nwestern side, and the two smallest on the east. The first of these arms\r\non the east side is the Bay of Cambaia, which is not above 50 or 60\r\nleagues in length: this receives two very considerable rivers, viz. the\r\nTapti and the Baroche, which Pietro de Valle calls the Mehi: the second\r\narm, towards the east, is famous for the velocity and height of its\r\ntides, which are greater than in any other part of the world, and which\r\nextends for more than 50 leagues. Many rivers fall into this gulph, as\r\nthe Indus, the Padar, &c. which have brought so great a quantity of\r\nearth and mud to their mouths as to raise the bottom almost to a level,\r\nthe inclination of which is so gentle, that the tide extends to a very\r\ngreat distance. The first arm on the west side in the Persian Gulph,\r\nwhich spreads more than 250 leagues on the land; and the second is the\r\nRed Sea, which extends more than 680, computing it from the island\r\nSocotora. These two arms should be regarded as two mediterranean seas,\r\ntaking them from beyond the straits of Ormuz and Babelmandel: they\r\nare both subject to the tides, but this is occasioned by their being\r\nso near the equator, where the motion of the tides is much greater\r\nthan in any other climate; and besides they are both very long and\r\nnarrow. The motion of the tides is more rapid in the Red Sea than in\r\nthe Persian Gulph, because the Red Sea is near three times longer and\r\nquite as narrow. The Red Sea does not receive any river whose motion\r\nmight oppose the tides, whereas the Persian Gulph receives three very\r\nconsiderable ones in its most projecting extremity. It appears very\r\napparently that the Red Sea has been formed by an eruption of the\r\nocean, for the bearing of the lands are exactly similar, the coasts\r\non each side of the straits follow the same direction,, and evidently\r\nappear to have been cut by waters.\r\n\r\nAt the extremity of the Red Sea is that famous neck of land called the\r\nIsthmus of Suez, which forms a barrier to the Red Sea, and prevents\r\nits communication with the Mediterranean. In a preceding article we\r\nnoticed the reasons which inclined us to think that the Red Sea is\r\nhigher than the Mediterranean, and that if the Isthmus of Suez was\r\ncut, an inundation and an augmentation of the latter might ensue. To\r\nwhich we shall subjoin, that if even it should not be agreed that the\r\nRed Sea is higher than the Mediterranean, it cannot be denied that\r\nthere is neither flux nor reflux in the Mediterranean, adjoining to\r\nthe mouths of the Nile; and that, on the contrary, in the Red Sea the\r\ntides are very considerable, and raise the water several feet, which\r\ncircumstance alone would suffice to send a quantity of water into the\r\nMediterranean if the Isthmus was broken. Besides, we have an example on\r\nthis subject quoted by Varenius, who says in page 100 of his Geography:\r\n\"Oceanus Germanicus, qui est Atlantici pars, inter Frisiam & Hollandium\r\nse effundens, efficit sinum, qui et si parvis sit respectu celebrium\r\nsinum maris, tamen & ipse dicitur mare, alluitque Hollandiæ emporium\r\nceleberrimum, Amstelodamum. Non procul inde abest lacus Harlemensis,\r\nqui etiam mare Harlemense dicitur. Hujus altitudo non est minor\r\naltitudine sinus illius Belgici, quem diximus & mittit ramum ad urbem\r\nLeidam, ubi in varias fossas divaricatur. Quoniam itaque nec lacus\r\nhis, neque sinus ille Hollandici maris inundant adjacentes agros (de\r\nnaturali constitutione loquor, non ubi tempestatibus urgentur, propter\r\nquas aggeres facti sunt) pater inde, quod non sint altiores quam agri\r\nHollandiæ. At vero Oceanum Germanicum esse altiorem quam terras hasce,\r\nexperti sunt Leidenses, cum suscepissent fossam seu alveum ex urbe sua\r\nad Oceani Germanici littora, prope Cattorum vicum perducere (distantia\r\nest duorum milliarum) ut, recepto per alveum hunc mari, possent\r\nnavigationem instituere in Oceanum Germanicum, & hinc in varias terræ\r\nregiones. Verumenimvero cum magnam jam alvei port em perfecissent,\r\ndesistere coacti sunt, quoniam turn demum per observationem cognitem\r\nest, Oceani Germanici aquam esse altiorem quam agrum inter Leidam et\r\nlitus Oceani istius; unde locus ille, ubi fodere desierunt dicitur,\r\n_Het malle Gat_. Oceanus itaque Germanicus est aliquantum altior quam\r\nsinus ille Hollandicus, &c.\" Therefore, as the German Sea is higher\r\nthan that of Holland, there is no reason why we should not believe the\r\nRed Sea may be higher than the Mediterranean. Herodotus and Diodorus\r\nSiculus speak of a canal of communication between the Nile, the\r\nMediterranean, and the Red Sea, and M. Del'isle published a map in\r\n1704, in which he traces one end of a canal to the most eastern part\r\nof the Nile, and which he judges to be a part of that which formerly\r\njoined the Nile with the Red Sea.[A]\r\n\r\n[A] See Mem. de l'Acad. Sciences, 1734.\r\n\r\nIn the third part of a book entitled, \"Connoisance de l'Ancien Monde,\r\nor the Knowledge of the Old World,\" printed in 1707, we meet with the\r\nlike sentiment; and it is there said, from Diodorus Siculus, that it\r\nwas Neco, King of Egypt, who began this canal, that Darius, King of\r\nPersia, continued it, and that it was finished by Ptolemy II. who\r\nconducted it as far as the city Arsinoe, and that it could be opened\r\nand shut when they found it needful. Without desiring to deny these\r\ncircumstances, I must own, that to me they appear doubtful. I do not\r\nknow whether the violence and height of the tide in the Red Sea, would\r\nnot be necessarily communicated to this canal; it appears to me, at\r\nleast, that it would have required great precautions to confine the\r\nwaters, to avoid inundations and to preserve this canal in good repair.\r\nThough historians assert that this canal was undertaken and finished,\r\nyet they do not tell us the length of its duration; and the remains\r\nwhich are pretended to be even now perceptible, are perhaps all that\r\nwas ever done of it. The name of the Red Sea has been given to this arm\r\nof the ocean, because it has the appearance of that colour in every\r\npart where corals, or madrepores, are met with at the bottom. In the\r\nHistoire General des Voyages, vol. i. pages 198 and 199, it is said,\r\n\"Before he quitted the Red Sea, D. Jean examined what might have been\r\nthe reason why that name was given to it by the ancients, and if, in\r\nfact, this sea differed from others in its colour. He knew that Pliny\r\nhad given several opinions on the origin of this name. Some derived it\r\nfrom a King named Erythros, who reigned in those parts, and which, in\r\nthe Greek language, signifies red. Others imagined that the reflection\r\nof the sun produces a reddish colour on the surface of the water, and\r\nothers that the water was naturally red. The Portuguese, who had made\r\nseveral voyages to the entrance of the straits, asserted that all the\r\ncoasts of Arabia were very red, and that the sand and dust which the\r\nwind carries into the sea, tinged the water of the same colour.\r\n\r\n\"D. Jean, who examined the nature of the water, and the qualities of\r\nthe coasts as far as Suez, asserts, that far from being naturally red,\r\nthe water is of the same colour as in other seas, and that the sand and\r\nthe dust having nothing red in themselves could not give this tinge to\r\nthe water. The earth of both countries, he says, is generally brown;\r\nit is even black in some places, and in others white. On the coasts\r\nof Suaquem, where the Portuguese had not penetrated, he saw three\r\nmountains streaked with red, but they were of a very hard rock, and the\r\nneighbouring country was of the common colour.\r\n\r\n\"The truth is, that this sea is throughout of an uniform colour, which\r\nis easy to be demonstrated; but it must also be owned, that in some\r\nparts it appears to be red through chance, and in others green and\r\nwhite; the explanation of which phenomena is as follows: From Suaquem\r\nto Kossir, that is, for the space of 136 leagues, the sea is filled\r\nwith shoals and rocks of coral; this name is given to them, by reason\r\nthat their form and colour render them so extremely like coral, that\r\nit requires great circumspection not to be deceived. There are two\r\nsorts of them, the one white and the other red; in many parts they\r\nare covered with a kind of gum, or glue, of a green, and in others\r\nwith a deep orange. Now the water of this sea is so transparent that\r\nthe bottom may be seen at 20 fathoms deep, especially from Suaquem to\r\nthe extremity of the gulph; it appears, therefore, to take the colour\r\nof the matters it covers; as for example, when the rocks are covered\r\nwith a green gum, the water above appears of a deeper green than the\r\nrocks themselves; and when the bottom is only sand, the water appears\r\nwhite: so likewise when the rocks are coral, the water seems to be\r\ntinged with red; and as these last coloured rocks are more frequently\r\nmet with there than any other, D. Jean concludes, that the name of the\r\nRed Sea was affixed to the Arabian Gulph in preference to the Green\r\nor White. He applauds himself on this discovery, because the method\r\nby which he ascertained it left him no room for doubt. He caused a\r\nfloat to be moored against the rocks in the parts which were not deep\r\nenough to permit vessels to approach them, and the sailors could often\r\nexecute his orders with facility, without the sea being higher than the\r\nstomach at more than half a league from the rocks. The greatest part\r\nof the stones and pebbles they drew up, in those parts where the water\r\nappeared red, was also of that colour: in the water which appeared\r\ngreen, the stones were green, and if the water appeared white, the\r\nbottom was white sand, without any other mixture.\"\r\n\r\nThe direction of the coast of the Red Sea, from Cape Gordafu to the\r\nCape of Good Hope, is pretty equal; in the course of which there are\r\nno bays, excepting an arm on the coast of Melinda, that might be\r\nsupposed as belonging to a large one provided the island of Madagascar\r\njoined the continent, which most probably was formerly the case,\r\nnotwithstanding it is now divided by the straits of Mosambique. The\r\ncoast bears the same direction from the Cape of Good Hope to Cape Negro\r\non the west side of Africa; it has the appearance of being a chain of\r\nhigh mountains, extends about 500 leagues, but contains scarcely any\r\nrivers of importance. Beyond Cape Negro however the land is much lower,\r\nand is supplied by several considerable rivers beside the Coanza and\r\nthe Zaire; and between that and Cape Gonsalvez, which is computed to\r\nbe about 420 leagues, there are the mouths of no less than twenty-four\r\nlarge rivers; from this last Cape to Cape Trois-pointes it is an open\r\nbay, in about the centre of which is a considerable projection called\r\nCape Formosa. On the southern side are the islands Fernanda, St.\r\nThomas, and the Prince's Island, and which there is reason to suspect\r\nare part of a chain of mountains from Rio del Rey to the river Jamoer.\r\nThe water turns somewhat into the land between Cape Trois-pointes\r\nto Cape Palmas, from the latter of which it is an open sea to Cape\r\nTangrin; beyond this Cape there is a small bay towards Sierra Leona,\r\nand another in which are the islands of Bisagas. We then come to a\r\nconsiderable projection into the ocean called Cape Verd; of which the\r\nislands of that name are supposed to be a continuation, although it\r\nis more probable they are so of Cape Blanc, which is both higher and\r\nextends farther into the sea. From Cape Blanc to Cape Bajador is a\r\nmountainous and hard coast to which the Canary Islands seem to belong.\r\n\r\nTurning from Africa we find an open bay extending to Portugal, and in\r\nabout the centre of which are the straits of Gibraltar, through which\r\nthe water runs with great rapidity into the Mediterranean, which\r\nflows almost 900 leagues into the interior part of land, and is the\r\ncause of many curious circumstances; 1st, it has no tides, at least\r\nthat are visible, excepting in the Gulph of Venice and what are almost\r\nimperceptible at Marseilles and at Tripoli; 2dly, it surrounds a number\r\nof extensive islands, for instance, Sardinia, Sicily, Corsica, Cyprus,\r\nMajorca, and Italy, which is the largest known. It has also a fertile\r\nArchipelago; indeed it is from the Mediterranean Archipelago, that all\r\ncollections of islands have been so denominated; this indeed has the\r\nappearance of belonging more to the Black Sea than the Mediterranean;\r\nnor is it in the least unlikely that Greece was at one time covered\r\nwith the waters of the Black Sea, which empties itself into the\r\nMarmora, and from thence finds its way into the Mediterranean.\r\n\r\nSome have asserted there was a double current in the Straits of\r\nGibraltar, the one superior, which carries the water of the ocean into\r\nthe Mediterranean, and the other inferior, which carries them in the\r\ncontrary direction; but this opinion is evidently false, and contrary\r\nto the laws of hydrostatics: it has likewise been asserted to be the\r\ncase in many other places, as in the Bosphorus, the strait of Sund, &c.\r\nand Marsilli relates even experiments made in the Bosphorus, to prove\r\nthe truth of these opposite currents; but the experiments must have\r\nbeen badly made, since the matter is totally repugnant to the nature\r\nand motions of the waters; besides Greaves in his Pyramidography,\r\npage 101 and 102, proves, by able experiments, that there is no such\r\nthing as a current in the Bosphorus, whose direction is opposite to\r\nthe superior: what may have deceived Marsilli and others, is possibly\r\nthe circumstance, that in the Bosphorus, the Straits of Gibraltar, and\r\nin all rivers which flow with rapidity, there is a considerable eddy\r\nalong the shores, the direction of which is generally contrary to the\r\nprincipal current of the waters.\r\n\r\nLet us now shortly trace all the coasts of the new continent. Cape\r\nHold-with-Hope, lying in the 73d degree north latitude, is the most\r\nnorthern land we are acquainted with in New Greenland, and is not above\r\n160 or 180 leagues distant from Cape North in Lapland. From this cape\r\nwe may follow the coast of Greenland as far as the polar circle, where\r\nthe ocean forms a broad strait between Iceland and Greenland. It is\r\npretended that this country, adjacent to Iceland, is not the ancient\r\nGreenland which the Danes formerly possessed as a province dependant\r\non their kingdom; for in that there were civilized Christians, who\r\nhad bishops, churches, and several towns wherein they carried on\r\ntheir commerce. The Danes also visited it frequently, and as easily\r\nas the Spaniards can go to the Canaries: there still exists, as it is\r\nasserted, laws and ordinances for the government of this province, and\r\nthose not very ancient: nevertheless, without attempting to divine how\r\nthis country became absolutely lost, it is certain not the least trace\r\nof what we have related is to be met with in New Greenland. The people\r\nare wild and savage; there is no vestiges of any edifice; nor have\r\nthey a word in their language which has an affinity with the Danish;\r\nin short, there is nothing which might give us room to judge that\r\nthis is the same country. It is even almost a desert, and surrounded\r\nwith ice for the greatest part of the year. But as these lands are of\r\na vast extent, and as the coasts have been but little frequented by\r\nmodern navigators, they may have missed the spot where the descendants\r\nof these polished people inhabit; or the ice having become more\r\nabundant in this sea, may prevent any approach to the shore near them:\r\nnevertheless, if we can rely on maps, this whole country has been\r\ncoasted, and according to them it forms nearly a peninsula, and at the\r\nextremity of which are the two straits of Forbishers and of Friesland,\r\nwhere it is extremely cold, although they are not higher than the\r\nOrkneys, that is, at 60 degrees.\r\n\r\nBetween the west coast of Greenland and that of Labrador, the ocean\r\nforms a gulph, and afterwards a large mediterranean, which is the\r\ncoldest of all seas, and the coasts of which are pot perfectly known.\r\nBy following this tract due north, we come to Davis's Strait, which\r\nleads to the Christian Sea, and is terminated by Baffin's Bay, which\r\nhas the appearance of forming a kind of road into Hudson's Bay.\r\nCumberland Strait, which as well as Davis's may lead to the Christian\r\nSea, is narrower and more liable to be frozen: that of Hudson,\r\nthough much more to the south, is also frozen during one part of the\r\nyear. A very strong motion of the tide has been remarked in these\r\nstraits, which is quite contrary to what is the case in the inland\r\nseas of Europe, as neither the Baltic nor Mediterranean have any;\r\nthis difference seems to arise from the sea's motion, which always\r\nmoving from east to west, occasions high, tides in the Straits, whose\r\nopenings are turned towards the east; whereas in those of Europe, which\r\nopen to the west, there is no motion; the ocean by its general motion\r\nenters into the first, and avoids the last; and this is the reason\r\nthat there are such violent tides in the seas of China, Corea, and\r\nKamtschatka.\r\n\r\nProceeding from Hudson's Strait towards Labrador, we come to a narrow\r\nopening, in which Davis, in 1586, sailed as far up as 30 leagues,\r\nand trafficked with the inhabitants, but no one has since attempted\r\na discovery of this arm of the sea, and we are only acquainted with\r\nthe country of the Esquimaux of all the adjacent land. The fort Pon\r\nChartrin is the only and the most northern habitation of this country,\r\nwhich is separated from the island of Newfoundland by the little strait\r\nof Belleisle, which is not much frequented. As the eastern coast of\r\nNewfoundland is in the same direction as the coast of Labrador, we must\r\nregard the latter as a part of the continent, the same as Isle-royal\r\nappears to have been a part of Arcadia. There is no very considerable\r\ndepth either on the great or other banks, where they fish for the cod;\r\nbut as they slant for a distance under water, very violent currents are\r\nproduced. Between Cape Breton and Newfoundland is a very broad Strait,\r\nby which we enter a small mediterranean, called the Gulph of St.\r\nLawrence. This sea has an arm which extends far into the country, and\r\nseems to be only the mouth of the river St. Lawrence. The motion of the\r\ntides is extremely plain in this arm of the sea, and even at Quebec,\r\nwhich projects more into the country, the waters rise several feet.\r\nOn quitting the Gulph of Canada, and following the coast of Arcadia,\r\nwe meet with a small gulph called Boston-Bay, which forms a small\r\nsquare inlet into the land. But before we trace this coast farther,\r\nit is just to remark, that from Newfoundland to the most projecting\r\nAntille island, even to Guiana, the ocean forms a very great bay, which\r\nreaches as far as Florida, at least 500 leagues. This bay of the new\r\ncontinent is similar to that of the old, of which we have taken notice,\r\nwhere the ocean, after having made a gulph between Kamtschatka and New\r\nBritain, afterwards forms a vast mediterranean, which comprehends the\r\nseas of Kamtschatka, Corea, China, &c. so that in the new continent\r\nthe ocean, after having formed a great gulph between Newfoundland and\r\nGuiana, forms a very large mediterranean, extending from the Antilles\r\nto Mexico, which confirms our observations on the motion of the sea\r\nfrom east to west, for it appears that the ocean has equally gained on\r\nthe eastern coasts of America and Asia. These great gulphs in the two\r\ncontinents are under the same degrees of latitude, and nearly of the\r\nsame extent.\r\n\r\nIf we examine the position of the Antilles, beginning at Trinidad,\r\nwhich is the most south, we cannot doubt but that Tobago, Trinidad,\r\nthe Grenades, St. Vincent, Martinico, Mary Galante, Antigua, and\r\nBarbadoes, with every other island adjacent, at one time formed a chain\r\nof mountains, whose direction was from south to north, like that of the\r\nisland of Newfoundland, and the country of the Esquimaux; afterwards\r\nthe direction of the Antilles is from east to west, beginning at\r\nBarbadoes, then passing by St. Bartholomew, Porto Rico, St. Domingo,\r\nand Cuba, and nearly the same as Cape Breton, Acadia, and New England.\r\nAll these islands are so adjacent to each other, that they may be\r\nlooked upon as an interrupted tract of land, and as the summit of an\r\noverflown country now possessed by the sea. Most of them in fact are\r\nonly points of mountains, and the sea which surrounds them is a real\r\nmediterranean where the motion of the flux and reflux is scarcely\r\nmore sensible than in our Mediterranean, although the openings they\r\npresent to the ocean are directly opposite to the motion of the waters\r\nfrom east to west, which must contribute to elevate the tides in the\r\ngulph of Mexico; but as this sea is very broad, the flux and reflux\r\ncommunicated to it by the ocean, dispersing over so large a space,\r\nbecomes almost insensible at the coast of Louisiana, and many other\r\nplaces.\r\n\r\nThe old and new continent appear, therefore, both to have been\r\nencroached upon by the ocean in the same latitudes. Both have a vast\r\nmediterranean and a great number of islands, which are situated nearly\r\nin the same latitudes; the only difference is, that the old continent\r\nbeing much broader than the new, there is in the western part of it a\r\nmediterranean, of which nothing similar can be found in the new; but\r\nit appears that all which has happened to the eastern countries of the\r\nold world has also happened to the eastern part of the new, and that\r\nthe greatest revolutions are nearly in the middle and towards their\r\nequators, where the most violent motion of the ocean is made.\r\n\r\nThe coasts of Guiana, comprehended between the mouth of the river\r\nOroonoko and the Amazones, presents nothing remarkable, but the latter,\r\nwhich is the broadest in the universe, forms a considerable extent of\r\nwater near Coropa, before it arrives at the sea, by the two different\r\nmouths which surround the island of Caviana. From the mouth of the\r\nAmazones to Cape St. Roche, the coast runs almost straight east; from\r\nCape St. Roche to St. Augustine it runs south, and from Cape St.\r\nAugustine to the Bay of All Saints it turns towards the west, so that\r\nthis part of Brazil forms a considerable projection in the sea, which\r\ndirectly faces a like projection of land in Africa. The Bay of All\r\nSaints is a small arm of the ocean, running about 50 leagues into the\r\nland, and is much frequented by navigators. From this bay to Cape St.\r\nThomas the coast runs direct south, and afterwards in a south-west\r\ndirection as far as the mouth of the Plata, where the sea forms an arm\r\nprojecting nearly 100 leagues into land. From thence to the extremity\r\nof America, the ocean forms a great gulph, terminated by the adjacent\r\nlands of Terra del Fuega, as Falkland Island, Cape Assumption, and the\r\nland discovered in 1671. At the bottom of this bay is the Straits of\r\nMagellan, which is the longest in the world, and where the tides flow\r\nextremely high. Beyond Magellan is that of La Maire, which is shorter,\r\nand at last Cape Horn, which is the south point of America.\r\n\r\nWe must remark on the subject of these points that they all face the\r\nsouth, and most of them cut by straits which run from east to west;\r\nthe first is that of South America, which faces the southern pole,\r\nand is cut by the Strait of Magellan; the second, that of Greenland,\r\nwhich also directly faces the south, and is also cut from east to west\r\nby Forbisher's Strait; the third that of Africa, which also faces the\r\nsouth; and beyond the Cape of Good Hope are banks and shoals, that\r\nappear to have been divided from it; the fourth, the peninsula of\r\nIndia, which is cut by a strait that forms the island of Ceylon, and\r\nfacing the south like all the rest. Hitherto we perceive no reason to\r\nbe given for this similarity, and can only remark such are the facts.\r\n\r\nFrom Terra del Fuega, all along the western coast of South America,\r\nthe ocean very considerably penetrates into the land; and this coast\r\nseems exactly to follow the direction of the lofty mountains which\r\ncross all South America, from south to north, from the equator to the\r\nArctic Pole. Near the equator the ocean forms a considerable gulph,\r\nbeginning at Cape St. Francois, and reaching as far as Panama, the\r\nfamous isthmus, which, like that of Suez, prevents the communication\r\nof the two seas, and without which there would be an entire separation\r\nof the old and new continents. From thence to California there is\r\nnothing remarkable. Between the latter and New Mexico an arm branches\r\noff, called Vermilion Sea, at least 200 leagues in length. In short,\r\nthe western coasts of California have been followed to the 43d degree,\r\nat which latitude Drake, who was the first that made the discovery of\r\nthe land to the north of California, and who called it New Albion,\r\nwas obliged, through excessive cold, to change his course, and to\r\nanchor in a small bay which bears his name, so that these countries\r\nhave not been discovered beyond the 43d and 44th degree, any more than\r\nthe lands pf North America beyond Moozemlaki under the 48th degree,\r\nand the Assiniboils under the 51st. The country of the first savages\r\nextends much more to the west than the east. All beyond, throughout an\r\nextent of more than 1000 leagues in length, and as many in breadth,\r\nis unknown, excepting what the Russians pretend to have discovered in\r\ntheir excursions from Kamtschatka to the eastern part of North America.\r\n\r\nThe ocean, therefore, surrounds the whole earth without any\r\ninterruption, and the tour of the globe may be made from the south\r\npoint of America; but it is not yet known whether the ocean surrounds\r\nthe northern part of the globe in the like manner; and all mariners\r\nwho have attempted to go from Europe to China by the north-east of\r\nnorth-west have alike miscarried in their enterprises.\r\n\r\nThe lakes differ from the mediterraneans; the first do not receive\r\nany water from the ocean; on the contrary, if they have communication\r\nwith the seas, they furnish them with water. Thus the Black Sea, which\r\nsome geographers have regarded as an arm of the Mediterranean, and\r\nconsequently as an appendix of the ocean, is only a lake, because,\r\nin place of receiving water from the Mediterranean, it supplies it\r\nwith some, and flows with rapidity through the Bosphorus into the lake\r\ncalled the Sea of Marmora, and from thence through the Strait of the\r\nDardanelles into the Grecian Sea. The Black Sea is about 250 leagues\r\nlong by 100 broad, and it receives a great number of rivers, as the\r\nDanube, the Nieper, the Don, the Boh, the Donjec, &c. The Don, which\r\nunites with the Donjec, forms, before it arrives at the Black Sea, a\r\nlake, called the Palus Meotis, which is more than 100 leagues in length\r\nby 20 or 25 broad. The sea of Marmora, which is below the Black Sea, is\r\na smaller lake than the Palus Meotis, being not more than 50 leagues\r\nlong and 8 or 9 broad.\r\n\r\nSome ancients, and among the rest Diodorus Siculus, have asserted that\r\nthe Euxine, or Black Sea, was formerly only a large river or lake,\r\nand had no communication with the Grecian sea; but being considerably\r\nincreased with time by the rivers which fell into it, the waters\r\nforced a passage at first on the side of the Cyanean islands, and\r\nafterwards on the side of the Hellespont. This opinion appears to be\r\nvery probable, and the operation is easily explained; for supposing the\r\nbottom of the Black Sea was formerly lower than it is at present, then\r\nthe rivers which come into it would have raised it by the mud and sand\r\nwhich they brought with them, until the surface of the water became\r\nhigher than the land, when consequently it would have forced a passage\r\nfor itself, and as the rivers still continue to bring sand and earth,\r\nand at the same time the quantity of water diminishes in the rivers,\r\nin proportion as the mountains from which they drew their sources are\r\nlowered, it may happen in a course of years that the Bosphorus will\r\nbe again filled up; but as these effects depend on many causes, it is\r\nscarcely possible to give more than mere conjectures thereon. From this\r\ntestimony of the ancients, Mr. Tournefort, in his voyage to the Levant,\r\nsays, on ancient authority, that the Black Sea receiving the waters of\r\na great part of Europe and Asia, after being considerably increased,\r\nopened itself a passage by the Bosphorus, and afterwards formed the\r\nMediterranean, or so considerably augmented it, that it became a great\r\nsea, and forced itself a road through the strait of Gibraltar, by which\r\nthe island of Atlantis, mentioned by Plato, was entirely overflowed.\r\nThis opinion has no foundation, since we are certain that it is the\r\nocean which flows into the Mediterranean, and not the Mediterranean\r\ninto the ocean. Besides, M. Tournefort has not combined two essential\r\nfacts, both of which he mentions: the first is, that the Black Sea\r\nreceives nine or ten rivers, not one of which but supplies it with more\r\nthan the Bosphorus throws out: and the second, that the Mediterranean\r\ndoes not receive more water from rivers than the Black Sea, although it\r\nis seven or eight times larger, and that what the Bosphorus supplies\r\nit with does not make the tenth part of what falls into the Black Sea;\r\nhow then could this tenth part of what falls into a small sea have\r\nformed not only a larger sea, but have also so greatly increased the\r\nwaters, as to have broken down the lands at the strait of Gibraltar,\r\nand overflow an island larger than the whole of Europe? It is easy to\r\nperceive that this passage of M. Tournefort has not had due reflection.\r\nThe Mediterranean receives at least ten times more water from the ocean\r\nthan from the Black Sea, because the Bosphorus is only 800 feet broad\r\nin its narrowest part, whereas the strait of Gibraltar is more than\r\n5000, and that, even supposing their velocity to be equal, still the\r\ndepth of the straits of Gibraltar is by far the greatest.\r\n\r\nM. de Tournefort, who ridicules Polybius on his predicting that the\r\nBosphorus would be filled up in time, did not pay sufficient attention\r\nto circumstances, when he asserted that event to be impossible. This\r\nsea receives eight or ten great rivers, and as most of them bring sand\r\nand mud, must it not gradually be choaked up? Must not the winds and\r\nthe natural current of the waters towards the Bosphorus, convey thither\r\na part of these matters? It is, therefore, very probable that in a\r\ncourse of time the Bosphorus will be filled, when the waters of the\r\nrivers which come into the Black Sea shall be gradually diminished;\r\nnow all rivers daily diminish, because the vapours collected by the\r\nmountains being the first sources of rivers, their quantity must\r\ndecrease as the mountains diminish in height.\r\n\r\nThe Black Sea in fact receives more water from rivers than the\r\nMediterranean, and the same author observes, \"the greatest rivers in\r\nEurope fall into the Black Sea, by means of the Danube, in which the\r\nrivers of Suabia, Franconia, Bavaria, Austria, Hungary, Moravia,\r\nCorinthia, Croatia, Bothnia, Servia, Transilvania, Wallachia, empty\r\nthemselves; those of Black Russia and Podolia, go into the same sea\r\nby the Niester; those of the southern and eastern parts of Poland, of\r\nthe northern parts of Muscovy, and the country of the Cossacks, enter\r\ntherein by the Neiper or the Boristhenes; the Tanais and Copa also fall\r\ninto the Black Sea by the Cimmerian Bosphorus; the rivers of Mingrelia,\r\nof which Phasis is the principal, also voids itself into the Black Sea,\r\nas does the Casalmac, the Sangaris, and other rivers of Asia Minor\r\nwhich have their course towards the north; nevertheless the Thracian\r\nBosphorus, which is the only outlet from it, is not comparable to any\r\nof these great rivers.\"\r\n\r\nThese facts prove, that evaporation alone carries off a very\r\nconsiderable quantity of water, and it is from this great evaporation\r\nfrom the Mediterranean that the ocean continually flows thither through\r\nthe straits of Gibraltar. It is difficult to estimate the quantity\r\nof water any sea receives; we should be acquainted with the breadth,\r\ndepth, and rapidity of all the rivers which enter therein, how much\r\nthey increase and diminish in the different seasons of the year, and\r\nhow much it loses by evaporation; the last of which is most difficult;\r\nfor even supposing it proportional to the surfaces, it must be more\r\nconsiderable in a hot than in a cold climate; besides, water mixed with\r\nsalt and bitumen, evaporates more slowly than fresh water; a troubled\r\nsea more quickly than one that is tranquil; and the difference of depth\r\nhas also some effect: in short, so many circumstances enter into this\r\ntheory of evaporation that it is scarcely possible to calculate any\r\nexact estimations on it.\r\n\r\nThe water of the Black Sea appears to be less clear and less saline\r\nthan that of the ocean. There are no islands in it, and its tempests\r\nare more violent and more dangerous than in the ocean, because the\r\nwhole body of its waters being contained in a bason, which has but a\r\nsmall outlet, when they are agitated, they have a kind of whirling\r\nmotion which strikes the vessels on every side with an insupportable\r\nviolence.\r\n\r\nNext to the Black Sea the greatest lake in the universe is the Caspian\r\nSea, whose extent in length from north to south is about 300 leagues,\r\nand scarcely more than fifty broad. This lake receives the Wolga and\r\nsome other considerable rivers, as the Kur, the Faie, and the Gempo;\r\nbut what is singular, it does not receive any on its eastern side; the\r\ncountry on that side being only a desert of sand almost unknown. Czar\r\nPeter I. sent some engineers there to design a chart of the Caspian\r\nSea, who discovered that its figure was quite different from that given\r\nby former geographers, who had represented it to be round, whereas it\r\nis very long and narrow. The eastern coasts of this sea, as well as the\r\nneighbouring country, were unknown: even the existence of lake Aral,\r\nwhich is 100 leagues distant from it towards the east, was doubtful,\r\nor at least thought to be a part of the Caspian Sea, so that before\r\nthe discoveries of the Czar there was unknown land in this climate\r\nupward of 300 leagues long by 100 or 150 broad. Lake Aral is nearly\r\nan oblong, and may be 90 or 100 leagues long, by 50 or 60 broad; it\r\nreceives two very considerable rivers, the Sideroias and the Oxus, but\r\nas well as the Caspian has no outlet for its waters; and it bears the\r\nfurther resemblance, for as the Caspian receives no river on the east,\r\nso lake Aral receives none on the west, from which we may presume, that\r\nformerly these two lakes were but one, and that the rivers having, by\r\ndegrees, diminished, left a great quantity of sand and mud, and which\r\nforms the country that now divides them. There are some small islands\r\nin the Caspian, and its waters are much less saline than those of the\r\nocean; storms are here very dangerous, and large vessels are not used\r\nin it for navigation, because it has many sand banks, shoals and rocks\r\nscattered under the surface of the water. Pietro della Valle says,\r\n\"The largest vessels employed on the Caspian Sea, along the coasts of\r\nMazanda in Persia, where the town of Ferhabad stands, although they\r\nare called ships, appear smaller than our Tartanes. Their sides are\r\nhigh, and they draw but little water, having a flat bottom. They give\r\nthis form to their vessels, not only because this sea is shallow, but\r\nbecause it is filled with shoals and sand banks; so that if the vessels\r\nwere not fabricated in this manner they could not be used with safety.\r\nIndeed, I was astonished, why at Ferhabad they fish only for salmon,\r\nwhich are found at the mouth of the river, some poor sturgeons, and\r\nother sort of fresh water fish, of little value: I attributed the cause\r\nof it to their ignorance of the arts of fishing and navigation until\r\nthe Cham of Esterabad, whose residence is at a sea port, informed me\r\nthat the waters are so shallow 20 and 30 leagues from shore that it\r\nwas impossible to cast the nets with the chance of taking any fish, and\r\nthat it was for this reason they gave the above-mentioned form to their\r\nvessels, which are not mounted with any cannon, as but few corsairs and\r\npirates ever visit this sea.\"\r\n\r\nStruys and other travellers have asserted, that in the neighbourhood\r\nof Kilan, there were two gulphs wherein the rivers of the Caspian were\r\ningulphed, and carried afterwards by subterranean canals into the\r\nPersian Gulph. De Fer and other geographers have even marked out these\r\ngulphs in their maps, nevertheless we are assured by the people sent by\r\nthe Czar that they do not exist.[B]\r\n\r\n[B] See Mem. Acad. Sciences, 1721.\r\n\r\nThe circumstance of willow leaves being seen in great quantities on the\r\nPersian Gulph, and which are supposed by the same authors to come from\r\nthe Caspian Sea because there are no such trees on the Persian Gulph,\r\nis fully as improbable as their subterraneous gulphs, and which Gemelli\r\nCareri, as well as the Muscovites, asserts are entirely imaginary: in\r\nfact, the Caspian is near one third smaller than the Black Sea, which\r\nlast also receives much more water by rivers than the former: the\r\nevaporation therefore is sufficient to carry off all its water, nor is\r\nit necessary to suppose subterraneous gulphs in the Caspian any more\r\nthan in the Black Sea.\r\n\r\nThere are lakes which do not receive any rivers, and from which none go\r\nout. There are others which both receive and discharge and some that\r\nonly receive them. The Caspian Sea, lake Aral, and the Dead Sea, are\r\nof the last kind; they receive the waters of many rivers, and contain\r\nthem. In Asia Minor there is a small lake of the like kind, and one\r\nmuch larger in Persia, on which the town of Marago stands; its figure\r\nis oval, and it is about ten or twelve leagues long, by six or seven\r\nbroad; it receives the river Tauris, which is not very considerable.\r\nThere is also a similar small lake in Greece, about 12 or 15 leagues\r\nfrom Lepanto, which are the only lakes of that kind known in Asia. In\r\nEurope there is not one which is considerable; in Africa there are many\r\nsmall ones, as those which receive the rivers Ghir, Zez, Touguedout,\r\nand Tasilet. These four lakes are pretty near each other, and situate\r\ntowards the frontiers of Barbary near the deserts of Zara; there is\r\nanother situated in the country of Kovar, which receives the river\r\nof Berdoa. In North America, where there are more lakes than in any\r\nother part of the world, not one of this kind is known, at least if we\r\nexcept two small collections of water formed by rivulets, the one near\r\nGuatimapo, and the other some leagues from Realnuevo, both in Mexico.\r\nBut in South America, at Peru, there are two contiguous lakes, one of\r\nwhich, lake Titicaca, is very large, and receives a river whose source\r\nis not very remote from Cusco, and from which no river issues: there\r\nis one smaller in Tucuman, which receives the river Sala; and another\r\nlarger in the same country, which receives the river Santiago, and\r\nthree or four others between Tucuman and Chili.\r\n\r\nThe lakes which receive no rivers, and from which no rivers issue,\r\nare greater in number than those just spoken of; these lakes are\r\nkinds of pools where the rain water collects; or may proceed from\r\nsubterraneous waters, which issue in form of springs, in low places,\r\nwhere they cannot afterwards find any drain. The rivers which overflow\r\nmay likewise leave stagnate waters in the country, which may remain\r\nfor a long time, and only be replenished by other inundations. The\r\nsea has often inundated lands and formed saline lakes therein, like\r\nthat at Haarlem, and many others in Holland, to which, no other origin\r\ncan be attributed; or by losing its natural motion, might quit some\r\nland, and leaving water in the lowest places may have formed lakes,\r\nwhich have continued to be supported by rains. In Europe there are\r\nmany small lakes of this kind, as in Ireland, Jutland, Italy, in the\r\ncountry of the Grisons, Poland, Muscovy, Finland, and in Greece. But\r\nall these lakes are very inconsiderable. In Asia there is one near the\r\nEuphrates, in the desert of Irac, more than 15 leagues long: another\r\nin Persia nearly of the same extent, and on which the towns of Kelat,\r\nTetuan, Vastan, and Van, are situated; another small one in Chorazan\r\nnear Ferrior; another in Independent Tartary, called Lake Levi; two in\r\nMuscovy Tartary, another in Cochinchina, and one in China very large,\r\nand not far distant from Nankin; this last, nevertheless, communicates\r\nwith the adjacent sea, by a canal several leagues in length. In Africa\r\nthere is a small lake of the same kind in the kingdom of Morocco;\r\nanother near Alexandria, which appears to have been left by the sea;\r\nanother very considerable one formed by the rain in the desert Azarad,\r\nabout the 30th degree latitude; this lake is eight or ten leagues long;\r\nanother still larger on which the town of Gaoga is situate, in the 27th\r\ndegree; another much smaller, near the town of Kanum, under the 30th\r\ndegree; one near the mouth of the river Gambia; many more in Congo,\r\nabout the 2d or 3d degree of south latitude; two more in the country\r\nof the Caffrees, one called the Lake Rufumbo, of no great length, and\r\nanother in the province of Arbuta, which is perhaps the greatest lake\r\nof this kind, being about 25 leagues in length by seven or eight in\r\nbreadth; there is also one of these lakes at Madagascar, near the east\r\nside, about the 29th degree of south latitude.\r\n\r\nIn America there is one of these lakes in the middle of the peninsula\r\nof Florida, in its centre is an island called Serope; the lake of\r\nMexico is also of this kind, this is almost round, and about 10 leagues\r\ndiameter; there is another still larger in New Spain, 25 leagues\r\ndistant from the coast of Campeachy Bay, and another smaller in the\r\nsame country near the coast of the South Sea. Some travellers have\r\nasserted that there was in the inland parts of Guiana a very great lake\r\nof that kind; it is called the Golden Lake, or Lake Parima. They have\r\nrelated surprising things of the riches of the neighbouring country,\r\nand of the quantity of gold dust that is found in this lake. They give\r\nit an extent of more than 400 leagues in length, and 125 in breadth. No\r\nriver, they say, goes out nor enters therein; although many geographers\r\nhave marked this lake in their maps, it is not probable there is any\r\nsuch existing.\r\n\r\nBut the most general and largest lakes are those which receive and give\r\nrise to other great rivers: as their number is very great I shall speak\r\nonly of the most considerable, or of the most remarkable. Beginning\r\nat Europe, we have in Switzerland the lake of Geneva, Constance, &c.;\r\nin Hungary, the lake Balaton; in Lavonia, a large lake, and which\r\nseparates this province from Russia; in Finland, the lake Lapwert,\r\nwhich is very long, and is divided into many arms, and lake Oula, which\r\nis of a round figure; in Muscovy, lake Ladoga, more than 25 leagues\r\nlong by above 12 broad. Lake Onega is as long, but not so broad. Lakes\r\nIlmen and Belozo, from whence issue one of the sources of the Wolga;\r\nthe Iwan-Osero, from whence issues one of the sources of the Don: two\r\nother lakes from whence the Vitzogda derives its origin; in Lapland,\r\nthe lake from which issues the river Kimi; another much larger near the\r\ncoast of Wardhus, and many others, from whence issue the rivers Lula,\r\nPithea, and Uma. These are not very considerable. In Norway two more\r\nof nearly the same size as those of Lapland: in Sweden, lake Vener,\r\nwhich is as large a lake as Meler, on which Stockholm is situated; and\r\ntwo others less considerable; one is near Eveldal, and the other near\r\nLincopin.\r\n\r\nIn Siberia, in Muscovy, and in Independent Tartary, there are a great\r\nnumber of these lakes, the principal of which is the great lake Baraba,\r\nwhich is more than 100 leagues long, and whose waters fall into the\r\nIrtis; the great lake Estraguel, the source of the same river: many\r\nother smaller, the sources of the Jenisca; the great lake Kita, the\r\nsource of the Oby; another larger, the source of the Angara; lake\r\nBaical, which is more than 70 leagues long, and is formed by the same\r\nriver Angara; lake Pehu, from which issues the river Urack, &c. In\r\nChina and Chinese Tartary, lake Dalai, from whence issues the large\r\nriver Argus, which falls into the river Amour; the lake of the three\r\nmountains, the source of the river Helum; the lakes Cinhal, Cokmor,\r\nand Sorama, the sources of the river Honaho; two other lakes adjacent\r\nto the river Nankin, &c. In Tonquin, lake Guadag, which is very\r\nconsiderable. In India, the lake Chiamat, from whence issues the river\r\nLaquia, adjacent to the sources of the rivers Ava, Longenu, &c. This\r\nlake is more than 40 leagues broad by 50 long. There is another at the\r\norigin of the Ganges; and one bordering on Cashmere is the source of\r\nthe river Indus, &c.\r\n\r\nIn Africa is lake Cavar, and two or three others adjacent to the mouth\r\nof Senegal river. Lakes Guarda and Sigismus make but one lake, of a\r\ntriangular form, about 100 leagues long by 75 broad, and contain a very\r\nconsiderable island. In this lake the Niger loses its name, and takes\r\nthat of Senegal, in the course of which, towards the source, we meet\r\nwith another considerable lake, called Bournou, where the Niger again\r\nloses its name, for the river which comes therein is called Gambaru. In\r\nEthiopia, at the sources of the Nile, is the great lake Gambia, upwards\r\nof 50 leagues long. There are also many lakes on the coast of Guinea,\r\nwhich appear to have been formed by the sea, and there are only a few\r\nlesser lakes in the remaining part of Africa.\r\n\r\nNorth America may be styled the country of lakes; the greatest are lake\r\nSuperior, upwards of 125 leagues long by 50 broad; lake Huron, upwards\r\nof 100 leagues long by 40 broad; lake Illionois, which, comprehending\r\nthe Bay of Puanto, is quite as extensive as lake Huron; lakes Erio, and\r\nOntario, together upwards of 80 leagues long, from 20 to 25 broad; the\r\nlake Mistasin, to the north of Quebec, is about 50 leagues in length;\r\nand lake Champlain, to the south of it, is nearly of the same extent;\r\nlake Alemipigon, and the lake Christinaux, both to the north of lake\r\nSuperior, are also very considerable; the lake Assiniboils contains\r\nmany islands, and is upwards of 75 leagues long; there are also,\r\nindependent of that of Mexico, two large lakes in that country, the one\r\ncalled Nicaragua, in the province of that name, which is upwards of 70\r\nleagues long.\r\n\r\nIn South America there is a small lake, the source of the Maragnon, and\r\nanother larger which is the source of the river Paraguay; also the lake\r\nTiticares, which falls into the river Plata; two smaller lakes which\r\nflow into the same river; and some others, not very considerable, in\r\nthe inland part of Chili.\r\n\r\nAll lakes from which rivers derive their origin, those which fall into\r\nthe course of rivers, and which carry their water thereto, are not\r\nsalt. Almost all those, on the contrary, which receive rivers without\r\nothers issuing thereout, are salt; this seems to favour the opinion\r\nthat the saltness of the sea arises from the salts which rivers wash\r\nfrom the earth, and continually convey into it; for evaporation cannot\r\ncarry off fixed salts, and consequently those which rivers carry into\r\nthe sea remain therein. Although river water appears to taste fresh, we\r\nwell know that it contains a small quantity of salt, and in course of\r\ntime might have acquired such a considerable degree, as to occasion the\r\npresent saltness of the sea, and which must still continue increasing.\r\nIt is thus, therefore, as I imagine, that the Black Sea, the Caspian,\r\nlake Aral, &c. have become salt. With respect to lakes, which do not\r\nreceive any river, nor from which does any issue, are either fresh or\r\nsalt, according to their different origins; those near the sea are\r\ngenerally salt, and those remote from it are fresh, because the one has\r\nbeen formed by the inundations of the sea, and the others proceed from\r\nsprings of fresh water.\r\n\r\nThe lakes any ways remarkable are the Dead Sea, the waters of which\r\ncontain much more bitumen than salt: it is called the Bitumen of Judea,\r\nbut is no other than the Asphaltes, which has caused some authors to\r\ncall it the Asphaltic Lake. The lands which border this lake contain a\r\ngreat quantity of this bitumen; and many have supposed, as the poets\r\nfeign of lake Avernus, that no fish could live therein, and birds which\r\nattempted to fly over it were suffocated; but neither of these lakes\r\nproduce such mortal events; fish live in both, birds pass over them,\r\nand men bathe therein without the least danger.\r\n\r\nAt Boleslaw, in Bohemia, there is said to be a lake, wherein are holes,\r\nwhose depth is unfathomable, from which impetuous winds issue, which\r\nare carried over all Bohemia, and in winter raise pieces of ice of an\r\n100 weight in the air.\r\n\r\nA petrified lake in Iceland is also mentioned; and lake Neagh, in\r\nIreland, has also the same property; but these petrifactions are no\r\nother than incrustations, like those made by the water of Arcueil.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARTICLE XII,\r\n\r\nOF THE FLUX AND REFLUX.\r\n\r\n\r\nWater has but one natural motion; like other fluids it always descends\r\nfrom the higher into the lower places, unless obstructed by some\r\nintervening obstacle. When it reaches the lowest place it remains\r\nthere calm and motionless, at least without some foreign causes which\r\nagitates and disturbs it. All the waters of the ocean are collected in\r\nthe lowest parts of the surface of the earth, of course the motions\r\nof the sea must proceed from external causes, the principal of which\r\nis the flux and reflux, which is alternatively made in a contrary\r\ndirection, and from which results a general and continual motion in the\r\nsea from east to west. These two motions have a constant and regular\r\nrelation with the motions of the moon. When the moon is new, or at\r\nthe full, this motion from east to west is more sensible, as well as\r\nthat of the tides, which upon most shores ebb and flow every six hours\r\nand a half: that it is always high tide whenever the moon is at the\r\nmeridian, whether above or below the horizon of the place; and low tide\r\nwhen the moon rises or sets. The motion of the sea from east to west\r\nis constant and invariable, because the ocean in its flux moves from\r\neast to west, and impels towards the west a great quantity of water,\r\nand the reflux seems to be made in a contrary direction, by reason of\r\nthe small quantity of water then driven towards the west; the flux,\r\ntherefore, must rather be regarded as a swelling, and the reflux as a\r\nsubsiding of the water, which instead of its disturbing the motion from\r\neast to west, produces and continually restores it, although in fact it\r\nis stronger during the rise, and weaker during the fall, from the above\r\nreason.\r\n\r\nThe principal circumstances of this motion are, 1. That it is more\r\nsensible when the moon is new, or at the full, than in the quadratures:\r\nin spring and in autumn it is also more violent than at any other time\r\nof the year; and it is weaker in the solstices, which, is occasioned\r\nby the combination of the attraction of the moon and sun. 2. The wind\r\noften alters the direction and quantity of this motion, particularly\r\nthat which constantly blows from the same quarter. It is the same\r\nwith respect to large rivers which convey their waters into the sea\r\nand produce a current there, often extending several leagues, which\r\nis strongest when the direction of the wind agrees with the general\r\nmotion. Of this we have an example in the Pacific Ocean, where the\r\nmotion from east to west is constant and very perceptible. 3. We must\r\nremark that when one part of a fluid moves, the whole mass receives the\r\nmotion; now in the motion of the tides a great part of the ocean moves\r\nin a very sensible manner, and consequently the ocean is agitated by\r\nthis motion throughout its whole extent.\r\n\r\nPerfectly to comprehend this we must attend to the nature of the power\r\nwhich produces the tides. We have observed that the moon acts upon the\r\nearth by a power called attraction by some, and by others gravity:\r\nthis force penetrates through the globe, is exactly proportioned to\r\nthe quantity of matter, and decreases as the square of the distance\r\nincreases. Let us next examine what must happen to the waters when the\r\nmoon is at the meridian of any one place.--The surface of the waters\r\nbeing immediately under the moon is then nearer that planet than any\r\nother part of the globe; hence this part of the sea must be elevated\r\ntowards the moon, by forming an eminence, the summit of which must\r\nbe opposite to the moon's centre; for the formation of this eminence\r\nthe waters at the bottom, as well as at the surface, contribute their\r\nshare, in proportion to the proximity they are in of the moon, which\r\nacts upon them in the inverse ratio of the squares of their distances:\r\nthus the surface of that part of the sea is first raised; the surface\r\nof the neighbouring parts will be likewise elevated, but to a less\r\nheight, and the water at the bottom of all these parts will be raised\r\nby the same cause; so that all this part of the sea growing higher\r\nand forming an eminence, it is necessary that the water of the remote\r\nparts, and on which this force of attraction does not act, proceeds\r\nwith precipitation to replace the waters which are thus elevated and\r\ndrawn towards the moon. This is what produces the flux, or high tide,\r\nwhich is more or less sensible on different coasts, and which agitates\r\nthe sea not only at its surface but even to the greatest depths. The\r\nreflux, or ebb, happens afterwards by the natural inclination of the\r\nwater, for when the moon no longer uses its power, the water which was\r\nraised by this foreign power retakes its level, and returns to the\r\nshores and places it had been forced to quit. When the moon passes to\r\nthe antipode, or opposite meridian, the same effect ensues, though\r\nfrom a different cause, In the first case the waters rise because they\r\nare nearer the planet than any other parts of the globe; and in the\r\nsecond it is from the contrary reason, they rise because she is the\r\nmost remote from them; and this it is easily perceived must produce\r\nthe same effect, for the waters of this part being less attracted\r\nthan those of the opposite hemisphere, they will naturally recede\r\nand form an eminence, the summit of which will answer to the point\r\nof the least action that is directly opposite to the moon's station,\r\nor where she was thirteen hours before. When the moon arrives at the\r\nhorizon the tide is ebb, the sea is then in its natural state, and\r\nthe water in a direct equilibrium; but when she is at the opposite\r\nmeridian this equilibrium can no longer exist, since the waters of\r\nthe part opposite to the moon being at the greatest distance possible\r\nfrom her, they are less attracted than the remaining part of the\r\nglobe, and hence their relative weight, which always retains them in\r\nan equilibrium, impels them towards the opposite point to the moon.\r\nThus in the two cases, when the moon is at the meridian of a place, or\r\nat the opposite meridian, the water must be raised nearly to the same\r\nheight, and consequently fall and rise, when the moon is at the horizon\r\neither at her rising or setting. Thus a motion, such as we have just\r\nmentioned, necessarily disturbs the whole mass of the sea, and agitates\r\nit throughout its whole extent and depth; and if this motion appears\r\ninsensible in the open seas, it is nevertheless no less real; but as\r\nthe winds cannot ruffle the bottom in an equal degree with the surface,\r\nthe motion of the tides is necessarily more regular there, although\r\ndirected alternately in the same manner as at the top.\r\n\r\nFrom this alternative motion of flux and reflux there results, as\r\nalready observed, a continual motion of the sea from east to west,\r\nbecause the moon, which produces the tides, proceeds from east to\r\nwest, and successively acting in the same direction, the water follows\r\nher course. This motion is most considerable in all sraits; for\r\nexample, at the straits of Magellan the water rises nearly 20 feet, and\r\ncontinues so for six hours, whereas the reflux lasts only two[C], and\r\nthe water runs towards the west. This evidently proves that the reflux\r\nis not equal to the flux, and that from both there results a motion\r\ntowards the west, much stronger in the time of the flux than in that of\r\nthe reflux. This is the reason that in open seas, remote from land, the\r\ntides are only felt by the general motion of the waters from east to\r\nwest.\r\n\r\n[C] See Narborough's Voyage.\r\n\r\nThe tides are stronger in the torrid zone between the tropics than in\r\nthe rest of the ocean: they are also more sensible in places which\r\nextend from east to west, in long and narrow gulphs, and on the coasts\r\nwhere there and isles and promontories. The greatest known flux is at\r\none of the mouths of the river Indus, where the water rises thirty\r\nfeet. It rises also very remarkably near Malays, in the straits of\r\nSund, in the Red Sea, in Nelson's Bay, at the mouth of the river St.\r\nLawrence, on the coasts of China, Japan, Banama, in the Gulph of\r\nBengal, &c.\r\n\r\nThe motion of the sea from east to west is more sensible in particular\r\nplaces. Mariners have observed it in sailing from India to Madagascar\r\nand Africa; it is also very perceptible in the Pacific Sea, and\r\nbetween the Malaccas and Brazil: but this motion is most violent in\r\nthe Straits; for example, the waters are carried with such great force\r\nin that direction through the Straits of Magellan that it is felt to\r\na great distance in the Atlantic; and it is supposed that this caused\r\nMagellan to conjecture there was a strait by which the two seas had a\r\ncommunication. In the Manilla straits, and in all the channels which\r\ndivide the Maldivian islands, the sea flows from east to west, as well\r\nas in the Gulph of Mexico, between Cuba and Jucatan. In the gulph of\r\nParia this motion is so violent that the strait is called the Dragon's\r\nMouth. In the Canadian and Tartarian Seas it flows also with violence,\r\nas well as in the Strait of Waigat, through which it conveys enormous\r\nmasses of ice into the northern seas of Europe. The Pacific Ocean flows\r\nfrom east to west, through the Straits of Java; the sea of Japan flows\r\ntowards China, the Indian Ocean flows towards the west, through the\r\nStraits of Java and other Indian islands; we cannot, therefore, doubt\r\nthat the sea has a constant and general motion from east to west, and\r\nit is certain the Atlantic flows towards America, and that the Pacific\r\nSea goes from it, as is evident at Cape Current between Lima and Panama.\r\n\r\nIn short, the alternatives of the flux and reflux are regularly made\r\nin six hours and a half on most coasts, though at different hours,\r\naccording to the climate and position of the lands: thus the sea coasts\r\nare continually beaten by the waves which at each time wash away some\r\nsmall parts of their matters, which they transport to a distance, and\r\ndeposit at the bottom of the sea; so likewise the waves convey, and\r\nleave on the lower shores, shells, sands, &c. these by degrees form\r\nhorizontal strata, which accumulating, become downs and hills, exactly\r\nsimilar to others, both as to form and internal composition. From this\r\nconstant action, the sea naturally shuts itself out from the lowest\r\ncoasts, and gains upon the highest.\r\n\r\nTo give an idea of the efforts of a troubled sea against coasts, I\r\nshall relate a fact which has been affirmed to me by a creditable\r\nperson, and which I the readier gave credit to, having seen something\r\nnearly similar. In the principal islands of the Orkneys there are\r\ncoasts composed of rocks perpendicularly divided to the surface of the\r\nsea, to the height of near 200 feet. The tides in this place rise very\r\nconsiderable, as is common in all parts where there are projecting\r\nlands and islands; but when the wind is very strong, and the sea swells\r\nat the same time, the motion is so great, and the agitation so violent,\r\nthat the water rises to the summit of these rocks, and falls again in\r\nthe form of rain: it throws to this great height gravel and stones from\r\nthe foot of the rocks, and some of them even broader than the hand.\r\n\r\nIn the port of Livourne, where the sea is much more calm, I saw a\r\ntempest in December, 1731, wherein they were obliged to cut down\r\nthe masts of some vessels that had been forced from their anchors\r\nby the wind, and driven into the road. The sea swelled above the\r\nfortifications, which were of a considerable height, and as I was on\r\none of the most projecting works, I could not regain the town before I\r\nwas wetted by the sea-water much more than I could have been by the\r\nmost plentiful rain.\r\n\r\nThese examples are sufficient to shew with what violence the sea acts\r\nagainst some coasts. This continual agitation destroys and diminishes\r\nby degrees the land. The water carries away all these matters, and\r\ndeposits them as soon as it arrives at a part where the troubled sea\r\nsubsides into a calm. In tempestuous weather the water is foul, from\r\nthe mixture of matters detached from the shore and bottom of the sea,\r\nwhich then casts on the coasts a number of things that it brings from a\r\ndistance, and which are never met with but after storms; as ambergris\r\non the west of Ireland, and yellow amber on those of Pomerania,\r\ncocoa-nuts on the coasts of India, &c. and sometimes pumice and other\r\nsingular stones. We can quote on this occasion a circumstance related\r\nin the new travels to the American Islands. \"Being at St. Domingo,\r\nsays the author, among other things they gave me some light stones,\r\nwhich the sea brought to the coast when there had been strong southerly\r\nwinds; there was one two feet and a half long by eighteen broad, and\r\none thick, which did not quite weigh five pounds: they are as white\r\nas snow, much harder than pumice, of a fine consistency, having no\r\nappearance of being porous, but when thrown into water, rebounded\r\nlike a ball thrown on the ground, and it was with great difficulty\r\nthey could be forced under the water with the hand.\" The stone must\r\nhave been a very fine and close-grained pumice, which had issued\r\nfrom some volcano, and which the sea had conveyed, as it transports\r\nambergris, cocoa-nuts, common pumice-stone, seeds of plants, rushes,\r\n&c. Observations of this kind have been generally made on the coasts\r\nof Ireland and Scotland. The sea by its general motion from east to\r\nwest must convey the productions of our coast to those of America; and\r\nit is by some irregular motions that the productions of the East and\r\nWest Indies, as well as the northern climates, are brought upon our\r\nshores. There is a great appearance that the winds cause those effects;\r\nlarge spots have often been observed in the high seas, far from shore,\r\ncovered with pumice-stones; they could only come from the volcanoes\r\nin islands or on the continent, and which the current had transported\r\nto the middle of the seas. Before the southern part of America was\r\nknown, and in the time when the India Sea was thought to have no\r\ncommunication with our ocean, appearances of this kind afforded the\r\nfirst supposition of it.\r\n\r\nThe alternative motion of the flux and reflux, and the constant motion\r\nof the sea from cast to west, presents different phenomena in different\r\nclimates, according to the bearing of the land and the height of the\r\ncoasts. There are parts where the general motion from east to west is\r\nnot perceptible; there are others where the sea has even a contrary\r\nmotion, as on the coast of Guinea. But these contrary motions are\r\noccasioned by the winds, by the position of the lands, by the waters\r\nof large rivers, and by the disposition of the bottom of the sea; all\r\nthese causes produce currents which alter, and often change the general\r\nmotion in many parts of the sea; but as the motion from east to west\r\nis the greatest, most general and constant, it must also produce the\r\ngreatest effects, and all taken together, the sea must gain ground\r\ntowards the west, and lose it towards the east; although it may happen\r\nthat on those coasts where the west winds blow during the greatest\r\npart of the year, as in France and England, the sea may gain on the\r\neast, yet these particular exceptions do not destroy the effect of the\r\ngeneral cause.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARTICLE XIII.\r\n\r\nOF THE INEQUALITIES AT THE BOTTOM OF THE SEA, AND OF CURRENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe coasts of the sea may be distinguished into three kinds, 1st, the\r\nelevated coasts, which are rocks and hard stones, generally divided\r\nperpendicularly, and which rise sometimes to the height of 7 or 800\r\nfeet. 2d, The low coasts, some of which are almost level with the\r\nsurface of the water, and others rising with a moderate elevation,\r\noften bounded by rocks at the water's edge, forming shelves and\r\nbreakers, which render the approach to shore very difficult and\r\ndangerous. 3dly, Downs, which are coasts formed by sand which the sea\r\naccumulates, or brought or deposited by rivers; these downs form hills\r\nmore or less elevated, according to the accumulated sand.\r\n\r\nThe coasts of Italy are bordered by several sorts of marble and\r\nstone; these rocks appear at a distance as so many pillars of marble\r\nperpendicularly divided. The coasts of France from Brest to Bourdeaux\r\nare almost surrounded with rocks just at the water's edge, which\r\noccasion dangerous breakers. The coasts of England, Spain, and many\r\nothers, are also bordered with rocks and hard stone; excepting some\r\nparts which are made use of for bays, ports, and havens.\r\n\r\nThe depth of water along the coasts is in proportion to their\r\nelevation. The inequalities at the bottom of the sea near the coasts,\r\ncorrespond also with the inequalities of the surface of the ground\r\nalong the shore. A celebrated navigator has made the following\r\nobservations on this subject.\r\n\r\n\"I have constantly remarked, that where the coasts are defended\r\nby steep rocks, the sea is there very deep, and seldom affords a\r\nprobability of anchoring; and, on the contrary, where the ground\r\ninclines from the coast to the sea, however elevated it may be further\r\ninland, the bottom is good there, and consequently admits of anchorage.\r\n\r\n\"According to the declivity of land, as it approaches the water's\r\nedge, so we generally find our anchor ground, and either approach or\r\nkeep at a distance from shore agreeable to the steepness of the land;\r\nfor I never saw or heard of a coast where the land is of a continual\r\nheight, without some vallies lying intermixed with the high-lands;\r\nthey are the subsiding of low lands, and afford good anchoring, the\r\nearth being lodged deep under water; for this reason it is we find good\r\nharbours upon coasts which abound with steep cliffs, because the land\r\nhas subsided between them. But Where the declensions from the hills is\r\nnot within land but towards the main sea, as at Chili and Peru, and\r\nthe coasts are nearly perpendicular, as in the countries running from\r\nthe Andes, it is very deep, and has scarcely any creeks or harbours.\r\nThe coasts of Gallicia, Portugal, Newfoundland, the islands of Juan\r\nFernando and St. Helena, &c. are somewhat similar to those of Peru,\r\nyet good harbours are not so scarce, as there is always good anchorage\r\nwhere there are short ridges of land. In general the land under water\r\nseems to be exactly proportioned to the rising of the contiguous part\r\nabove, and therefore, where the lands upon the shores are steep, there\r\nis but little security for ships, they being very easily driven from\r\ntheir moorings; yet although steep cliffs denote this disadvantage,\r\nthey assure us of this benefit also, that we can sail close to them\r\nwith safety, besides being able to see them at a considerable distance;\r\nwhereas low lands are frequently not discovered until we are near, and\r\nalways experience the hazard of running aground. This fact of good\r\nanchorage where the lands on the coast are low, might be illustrated by\r\nmany instances in the bays of Campeachy, Honduras, Panama; the coasts\r\nof Portobella, Carthagena, Guinea, Callifornia, China, Coromandel, &c.\r\nbut going into particulars would be almost endless, as I very seldom\r\nfound it otherwise than that deep waters and high shores went together,\r\nas well as low lands and shallow seas.\"\r\n\r\nThe fact therefore of there being considerable mountains, and other\r\ninequalities, at the bottom of the sea is fully confirmed by the\r\nobservations of navigators. Divers also assure us, there are smaller\r\ninequalities formed by rocks, and that it is much the coldest in the\r\nvallies of the sea. In general the depths in great seas, as we have\r\nalready observed, increase proportionably to their distance from shore.\r\nBy Mr. Buache's chart of that part of the ocean between the coasts of\r\nAfrica and America, and by the divisions he has given of the sea from\r\nCape Tagrin to Rio-Grande, there appears to be similar inequalities in\r\nthe ocean to those on land. That the Albrolhos, where there are some\r\nrocks at the surface of the water, are only the tops of very large\r\nand lofty mountains, of which Dolphin island is one of the highest\r\npeaks. That the islands of Cape de Verd are also the tops of mountains\r\nthat there are a great number of shoals in the sea, which round the\r\nAlbrolhos descends even to unknown depths.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the quality of the different soils which form the\r\nbottom of the sea, as we must rely on divers and the plumb, we can say\r\nnothing exact or precise concerning it; we only know that there are\r\nparts covered with mud to a considerable thickness, on which anchors\r\nhave no hold; in these parts probably the mud of rivers are deposited.\r\nIn other parts are sands similar to those on land. In others are\r\nshells, heaped up together, madrepores, corals, and other productions\r\nof insects, which begin to unite and appear like stones; in others are\r\nfragments of stones, gravel, and often entire stones and marble. For\r\nexample, in the Maldivian islands the buildings are made of a hard\r\nstone weighed up from several fathoms under water. At Marseilles very\r\ngood marble is obtained from the bottom of the sea, which, so far from\r\nwasting and spoiling stone and marble, in our discourse on minerals,\r\nwe shall prove they are formed and preserved therein; whereas the sun,\r\nearth, air, and rain water, corrupts and destroys them.\r\n\r\nThe bottom of the sea must be composed of the same matters as our\r\nhabitable land, because the very same substances are contained in the\r\none as the other; places are found at the bottom of the sea, covered\r\nwith shells, madrepores, and other productions of sea matters, as we\r\nmeet with on earth an infinity of quarries and banks of chalk and other\r\nmatters replete with the same sort of shells, madrepores, &c. so that\r\nin all respects the dry parts of the globe resemble those covered by\r\nthe water, both in composition of matters, and inequalities of the\r\nsuperfices.\r\n\r\nIt is to these inequalities at the bottom of the sea, we must attribute\r\nthe origin of currents, for if the bottom was equal and level, there\r\nwould be no other current than the general motion from east to west,\r\nand a few others which might be caused by the action of the winds; but\r\na certain proof that most currents are produced by the flux and reflux,\r\nand directed by the inequalities at the bottom of the sea, is, that\r\nthey regularly follow the tides, and change their direction at each ebb\r\nand flow. See Pietra della Valle on the subject of the currents of the\r\ngulph of Cambay, and the accounts of all navigators, who unanimously\r\nassert that in those parts where the flux and reflux of the sea is the\r\nmost violent, the currents are also most rapid.\r\n\r\nTherefore it cannot be doubted but that the tides produce currents\r\nwhose direction always answers that of the opposite hills and all\r\nmountains between which they flow. Currents produced by winds, also\r\nfollow the direction of those hills which are under the water, seldom\r\nrunning opposite to the wind which produces them, any more than those\r\nwhich are occasioned by the tides follow the direction of their\r\noriginal cause.\r\n\r\nTo give a clear idea of the productions of currents, we shall first\r\nobserve they are to be met with in every sea; that some are rapid,\r\nand others slow; that some are of great extent, both in length and\r\nbreadth, and others short and narrow; that the same cause, whether the\r\nwind or tides, which produces these currents, frequently gives to each\r\nof them a velocity and direction very different; that a north wind,\r\nfor example, which should give the water one general motion towards\r\nthe south, on the contrary, produces a number of currents, separated\r\nfrom each other, and very different both in extent and direction; some\r\nflowing towards the south, others south-east, and others south-west;\r\nsome are very rapid, others slow; some long and broad, others short\r\nand narrow; in fact, their motions are so various that we have no idea\r\nleft of their original cause. When a contrary wind succeeds, all these\r\ncurrents take an opposite course, and follow in a contrary direction,\r\nprecisely in the same manner as would be the case upon land between two\r\nopposite and adjacent hills, provided it was covered with water, as\r\nis seen at the Maldiva and all the islands of the Indian seas, where\r\nthe currents run, and the winds blow, for six months in a contrary\r\ndirection. The same remark has been made on currents between shoals\r\nand sandbanks. In general all currents, whether caused by the motion\r\nof flux or reflux, or the action by the wind; have the same extent and\r\ndirection throughout their whole course, yet differ from each other\r\nin most respects, which can proceed only from the inequalities of the\r\nhills, mountains, and vallies, at the bottom of the sea, it being\r\ncertain that the current between two islands follows the direction of\r\nthe coasts; and the same is observable between banks of sand, shoals,\r\n&c. we must, therefore, look on the hills and mountains of the bottom\r\nof the sea as banks which direct the current; and hence a current is a\r\nriver, the breadth of which is determined by that of the valley through\r\nwhich it flows: its rapidity depends on the force which produces it,\r\ncombined with the breadth, of the interval through which it must\r\npass: and its direction is traced by the position of the hills and\r\ninequalities between which it must take its course.\r\n\r\nWe shall now give a reason for the singular correspondence between the\r\nangles of mountains and hills, which are to be met with in every part\r\nof the world. We have already remarked that when a river, &c. forms an\r\nelbow, one of the borders forms on one side a projection inland, and\r\nthe other forms a point from land, and that through all the sinuosities\r\nof their course this correspondence is always found. This fact is\r\nfounded on the laws of hydrostatics. It would be easy to demonstrate\r\nthe cause of this effect; but it is sufficient that it is general and\r\nuniversally known, and that all the world may be convinced of it by\r\ntheir own eyes, that when the banks of a river form a projection inland\r\nto the left hand, the other shore forms a projection from land to the\r\nright.\r\n\r\nHence the currents of the sea must be looked upon as great rivers,\r\nsubject to the some laws as those on land, and will, like them, form\r\nin the extent of their course many sinuosities, whose projections or\r\nangles will correspond; and as the banks of currents are hills and\r\nmountains, above or below the surface of the water, they will have\r\ngiven these eminences the same form as is remarked on the shores\r\nof rivers; therefore we must not be astonished that our hills and\r\nmountains, which have been formerly covered by the sea, and formed by\r\nthe sediments which the waters have left, should, by the motion of\r\nits currents, have taken this regular figure, and all the angles are\r\nalternately opposite; they have been the shores of the currents or\r\nrivers of the sea, and have therefore necessarily taken a figure and\r\ndirection similar to those of the shores of the rivers of the earth.\r\n\r\nThis alone, independent of the other proofs we have given, would be\r\nsufficient to evince that the earth of our continent and islands have\r\nbeen covered with waters of the ocean, and doubtless throws great light\r\nupon the Theory which I have endeavoured to prove well founded; for it\r\nwas not sufficient to have proved that the strata of the earth were\r\nformed by the sediments of the sea; that the mountains were elevated\r\nby the successive accumulation of such sediments; and that they were\r\ncomposed of shells and other marine productions; but it required also\r\na reason why the angles of mountains so exactly correspond; this could\r\nonly be done by an investigation into the real cause, which had not\r\nhitherto been attempted, and which, being united with the rest, forms a\r\nbody of proofs as complete as may be had in physics, and establishes my\r\nTheory to be founded on facts, independent of all hypothesis.\r\n\r\nThe principal currents of the ocean are those observed in the Atlantic\r\nSea, near Guinea. They extend from Cape Verd to the Bay of Fernandes.\r\nTheir motion is from west to east; that is contrary to the general\r\nmotion of the sea. These currents are so rapid that vessels sail in\r\ntwo days from Moura to Rio de Benin, a course of 150 leagues; but they\r\nrequire six or seven weeks to return; nor would it be possible to get\r\nout of these climates if advantage was not taken of the tempestuous\r\nwinds which suddenly rise in them; but there are entire seasons during\r\nwhich vessels cannot stir, the sea being continually calm, excepting\r\nwhat arises from the currents, which is always directed towards the\r\ncoasts, and never extend more than 20 leagues from shore. Near Sumatra\r\nthere are rapid currents, which flow from south to north, and which\r\nprobably formed the gulph at Malacca. There are also considerable\r\ncurrents between Java and Magellan, the Cape of Good Hope, and the\r\nisland of Madagascar, especially on the coast of Africa, between\r\nNatal and the Cape. In the Pacific Sea, on the coast of Peru, and the\r\nrest of America, the sea moves from south to north, and a south wind\r\ncontinually blowing there seems to be the cause. The like motion\r\nis observed on the coasts of Brazil; from Cape St. Augustine to the\r\nAntilles; from the mouth of the Manilla strait to the Philippine\r\nislands; and in the port of Kubuxiu at Japan[D].\r\n\r\n[D] See Varen. Geography, page 140.\r\n\r\nThere are violent currents in the sea adjacent to the Maldivian\r\nislands; and between those islands these currents flow, as already\r\nobserved, constantly for six months from east to west, and during the\r\nother six months they follow the direction of the monsoons, and it is\r\nprobable they are produced by those winds.\r\n\r\nWe speak here only of currents, whose extent and rapidity are very\r\nconsiderable, for in every sea there are an infinity of currents,\r\nthough of no great importance. The flux and reflux, the winds, and all\r\nother causes which agitate the waters, produce currents, more or less\r\nperceptible, in different parts. We have observed that the bottom of\r\nthe sea, like the surface of the earth, is overspread with mountains\r\nintersected with inequalities and divided by banks of sand. In all\r\nmountainous places currents will be violent; in all places where the\r\nbottom of the sea is level they will be almost imperceptible; the\r\nrapidity of the current will increase in proportion to the obstacles\r\nthe water meets with, or rather to the contraction of the spaces\r\nthrough which they incline to pass. Between two chains of mountains the\r\ncurrent will be so much the stronger as the mountains are near. It will\r\nbe the same between two banks of sand, or two neighbouring islands. It\r\nis also remarked in the Indian ocean, which is divided with an infinity\r\nof islands and banks, there are rapid currents throughout, which render\r\nthe navigation of that sea dangerous.\r\n\r\nIt is not inequalities at the bottom of the sea alone which form\r\ncurrents, but the coasts themselves have a similar effect, as the water\r\nis repelled at greater or lesser distances: this repulsion of the\r\nwaters is a kind of current which circumstances can render continual\r\nand violent; the oblique position of a coast, the vicinity of a bay,\r\nor of some great river, a promontory; in one word, every particular\r\nobstacle which opposes the general motion, will always produce a\r\ncurrent. Now, as nothing is more irregular than the bottom and borders\r\nof the sea, we must cease from being surprised at the great number of\r\ncurrents which every where appear.\r\n\r\nAll currents have a determinate breadth, which depends on that of\r\nthe interval between the two eminences which serves it for a bed.\r\nThe currents flow into the sea as rivers flow on land, and they\r\nproduce similar effects. They form their bed, and give to eminences\r\ncorresponding angles. In one word, it is these currents which hollowed\r\nour vallies, formed our mountains, and gave to the surface of the\r\nearth, when it was under water, the form it now retains.\r\n\r\nIf any doubt of the correspondence of the angles of mountains remains,\r\nI appeal to the sight of every man who makes the observation. Every\r\ntraveller, with the smallest attention, will perceive that the opposite\r\nsides of a hill exactly correspond. Whenever the hills to the right of\r\nthe valley form a projection, those opposite recede to the left. These\r\nhills have also nearly the same elevation, and it is very rare to see\r\nany great inequality of height in the two hills separated by a valley.\r\nI can assert, that the more I have looked on the circumference and\r\nheights of hills, the more I have been convinced of the correspondence\r\nof the angles, and of the resemblance they have with the beds and\r\nborders of rivers; and it is by reiterated observations on this\r\nsurprising regularity and resemblance that my first ideas of this\r\nTheory of the Earth arose. Let us add to these observations that of the\r\nparallel and horizontal situation of the strata, that of the shells\r\nbeing dispersed throughout the earth, and incorporated in every matter;\r\nand it must be admitted, that on a subject like this we cannot have a\r\ngreater degree of probability.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARTICLE XIV.\r\n\r\nOF REGULAR WINDS.\r\n\r\n\r\nNothing can appear more irregular and variable than the force and\r\ndirection of winds in our climates; but there are countries where this\r\nirregularity is not so great, and others where the winds constantly\r\nblow in one direction, and with almost the same degree of strength.\r\n\r\nAlthough the motion of the air depends on a great number of causes,\r\nthere are nevertheless principal ones, of which it is difficult to\r\nestimate the effects, because of the modifications from secondary\r\ncauses. The most powerful cause is the heat of the sun, which produces\r\nsuccessively a considerable rarefaction in different parts of the\r\natmosphere, and gives rise to an east wind that constantly blows\r\nbetween the tropics, where rarefaction is the greatest.\r\n\r\nThe force of the sun's attraction, and even that of the moon on the\r\natmosphere, are inconsiderable in comparison with that just mentioned;\r\nit is true, this force produces in the air a motion similar to that\r\nof the flux and reflux in the sea, yet it must not be supposed that\r\nthe air, because it has a spring, and is 800 times lighter than water,\r\nreceives, by the action of the moon, a more considerable motion than\r\nthat of the waters of the sea; for the distance of the moon being the\r\nsame, a sea of any fluid matter will have nearly the same motion,\r\nbecause the force which produces it penetrates the matter, and is\r\nproportional to its quantity; thus a sea of water, air, or quicksilver,\r\nwould elevate itself nearly to the same height, by the action of the\r\nsun and moon; hence we see that the the influence of the planets\r\nin the atmosphere is not considerable, and although it must cause a\r\nslight motion of the air from east to west, this motion is insensible\r\nin comparison with that produced by the heat of the sun; but as the\r\nrarefaction will be always greatest when the sun is at the zenith, the\r\ncurrent of air must follow the sun, and form a constant wind from east\r\nto west. This wind blows continually over the sea in the torrid zone,\r\nand in most parts of the land between the tropics; it is this wind\r\nwe feel at the sun's rising; and in general the east winds are more\r\nfrequent and impetuous than the west; this general wind from east to\r\nwest extends even beyond the tropics, and blows so constantly in the\r\nPacific Sea, that vessels which sail from Acapulco to the Philippines,\r\nperform their voyage, which is more than 2700 leagues, without any\r\nrisque, and almost without any need of directing their course. In the\r\nAtlantic, between Africa and Brazil, this wind is also constant: it is\r\nfelt also between the Philippines and Africa, but not in so constant a\r\nmanner, by reason of the islands, and different obstacles that are met\r\nwith in that sea; for during the months of January, February, March,\r\nand April, it blows between the Mozambique coast and India, but during\r\nthe other months, it gives place to different winds: and although this\r\neast wind is less felt on the coasts than in the open sea, and still\r\nless in the middle of continents than on the coasts; nevertheless there\r\nare places where it blows almost continually, as on the east coasts of\r\nBrazil, on the coasts of Loango, in Africa, &c.\r\n\r\nThis east wind continually blowing under the line, is the cause, that\r\nsailing from Europe to America, the course of the vessel is directed\r\nfrom the north to the south, along the coasts of Spain and Africa, to\r\nwithin 20 degrees of the equator, where this east wind is met with,\r\nwhich carries them directly to the coasts of America. The voyage from\r\nAcapulco to the Philippine islands, is made in two months by the favour\r\nof this east wind: but the return from them to Acapulco is longer and\r\nmore difficult. At 28 or 30 degrees on this coast from the line, the\r\nwestern wind is nearly as constant, which is the reason that vessels\r\nreturning from the East Indies to Europe, do not follow the same track\r\nas in going; those from New Spain sail north along the coasts till they\r\narrive at the Havannah, and from thence they continue northward, until\r\nthey meet with the westerly winds which carry them to the Azores and\r\nafterwards to Spain. So likewise in the South Sea, those which return\r\nfrom the Philippines, or China, to Peru, or Mexico, sail north as far\r\nas Japan, and navigate under that parallel to a certain distance from\r\nCalifornia, from whence, coasting along New Spain, they arrive at\r\nAcapulco. These winds do not always blow from one point, but in general\r\nfrom the south-east from April to November, and from the north-east\r\nfrom November to April.\r\n\r\nThe east wind, by its action, increases the general motion of the\r\nsea from east to west; it also produces currents which are constant,\r\nsome flowing from east to west, others from west to east; and from\r\nthe east to the south-west or north-west, following the direction of\r\nthe eminencies and chains of mountains at the bottom of the sea, the\r\nvallies that divide them serving as channels to these currents. The\r\nalternative winds which blow sometimes from the east, and sometimes\r\nfrom the south, produce also currents which change their direction at\r\nthe same time with these winds.\r\n\r\nThe winds which blow continually for some months, are generally\r\nfollowed by contrary winds, and therefore mariners are obliged to wait\r\nfor that which is favourable to their voyage. When these winds change,\r\na calm or dangerous tempest generally ensues, and which continues for\r\nseveral days, sometimes a month, and has been known for more than two.\r\n\r\nThese general winds caused by the rarefaction of the atmosphere, are\r\ndifferently combined and modified by different causes in different\r\nclimates. In that part of the Atlantic, under the temperate zone,\r\nthe north wind blows almost constantly during the months of October,\r\nNovember, December, and January, which makes those months the most\r\nfavourable to embark from Europe to India, in order to pass the line\r\nby the aid of these winds; and it is known by experience, that ships\r\nwhich quit Europe in the month of March frequently do not arrive\r\nsooner at Brazil than those which sail in the October following. The\r\nnorth wind almost continually reigns during winter in Nova Zembla, and\r\nother northern coasts. The south wind blows during the month of July\r\nat Cape de Verd, when the rainy season, or winter of these climates\r\nsets in. At the Cape of Good Hope the north-west wind blows during\r\nthe month of September. At Patna, in the East Indies, the north-west\r\nwind blows during the months of November, December, and January, and\r\nproduces heavy rains; but the east wind blows during the other nine\r\nmonths. In the Indian ocean, between Africa and India, as far as the\r\nMalacca islands, the monsoons reign from east to west from January to\r\nthe beginning of June, the west winds begin in the months of August or\r\nSeptember; during the interval of June and July, there are dreadful\r\ntempests generally from the north winds; but on the coasts these winds\r\nvary much more than in the open sea.\r\n\r\nIn the kingdom of Guzarat, and on the coasts of the neighbouring sea,\r\nthe north winds blow from March till September, and during the other\r\nmonths south winds almost always reign. The Dutch, to return from Java,\r\ngenerally set sail in the month of January or February, when they have\r\nthe assistance of an easterly wind which is felt as far as the 18th\r\ndegree of South latitude; afterwards they meet with the south winds\r\nwhich carry them to St. Helena[E].\r\n\r\n[E] See Varen. Geography, gener. cap. 20.\r\n\r\nThere are regular winds produced by the melting of snows, which the\r\nancient Greeks have noticed. During summer a north-east wind, and\r\nin winter one from the south-east, were noticed in Greece, Thrace,\r\nMacedonia, the Egean sea, and as far as Egypt and Africa; the same kind\r\nof winds have been remarked at Congo, at Guzarat, and at the extremity\r\nof Africa, which are all produced by the melting of the snows. The flux\r\nand reflux of the sea also produce regular winds which remain only a\r\nfew hours, and in many places winds are observed to blow from the land\r\nduring night, and from the sea during the day, as on the coasts of New\r\nSpain, Congo, the Havannah, &c.\r\n\r\nThe north winds are pretty regular in the polar circles; but the nearer\r\nwe approach the equator, the weaker they become: a circumstance equally\r\ncommon to the two poles.\r\n\r\nIn the Atlantic and Ethiopian ocean within the tropics there is an\r\neast wind which blows all the year without any considerable variation,\r\nexcepting some few small places, where it changes according to\r\ncircumstances and the position of the coasts. First, near the coasts\r\nof Africa, having passed the Canary islands, about the 28th degree\r\nof north latitude, a fresh wind blowing from the north-east or\r\nnorth-north-east, is sure to be met with; this wind accompanies the\r\nvessels to the 10th degree of the same latitude; about 100 leagues\r\nfrom the coast of Guinea; where at the 4th degree north latitude they\r\nmeet with calms and tornadoes. Secondly, in going to America by the\r\nCaribbee islands, this wind is found to veer more and more to the east,\r\nin proportion as they approach the coast. Thirdly, the limits of these\r\nvariable winds in the Atlantic, are greater on the American coasts than\r\non those of Africa. A south or south-west wind blows continually all\r\nalong the coast of Guinea for a space of 500 leagues from Sierra Leona\r\nto the island of St. Thomas; the narrowest part of that sea is from\r\nGuinea to Brazil, being not more than 500 leagues across. Nevertheless,\r\nships which sail from Guinea do not direct their course straight to\r\nBrazil, especially when they sail in the months of July and August, for\r\nthe purpose of taking advantage of the south-east winds which reign at\r\nthat time[F].\r\n\r\n[F] See Abridg. Phil. Tran. vol. II, page 129.\r\n\r\nIn the Mediterranean the east wind blows from the land in the evening\r\nat the sun's setting, and the west wind from the sea at its rising in\r\nthe morning. The south wind, which is commonly attended with rains,\r\nand which generally blows at Paris, Burgundy and Champagne about the\r\nbeginning of November, gives place to mild and temperate breezes that\r\nproduce that fair weather vulgarly called the summer of St. Martin's.\r\n\r\nDoctor Lister pretends that the east wind that blows between the\r\ntropics all the year, is produced by the vapour of the plant called sea\r\nlentil, which is extremely plentiful in those climates, and that the\r\ndifference of the winds on the land proceeds only from the different\r\ndisposition of the trees and forests; and he very seriously gives this\r\nridiculous imagination for a cause of the wind, by saying, that at noon\r\nthe wind is strongest because the plants are hotter and respire the\r\nmost, and that it blows from east to west, because all plants, somewhat\r\nlike sun-flowers, turn and respire with the sun.\r\n\r\nOther authors have mentioned the motion of the earth on its axis as the\r\ncause of this wind: this opinion is specious; and every person, even\r\nbut little initiated in mechanics, must comprehend, that no fluid which\r\nsurrounds the earth can have a particular motion from the rotation\r\nof the globe; that the air can have no other motion than that of the\r\nearth, and that all turning together at one time, this rotative motion\r\nmust be as insensible in the atmosphere, as it is on the surface of the\r\nearth.\r\n\r\nThe principal cause of the winds, as we have observed, is the heat of\r\nthe sun; on this subject we refer to Halley's Treatise in Phil. Trans.\r\nAll causes which occasion rarefaction or condensation in the air will\r\nproduce winds, whose directions will be opposite to the places where is\r\nthe greatest rarefaction or condensation.\r\n\r\nThe pressure of the clouds, the exhalations of the earth, the\r\ninflammation of meteors, &c. are causes which also produce considerable\r\nagitations in the atmosphere. Each of these causes combining in\r\ndifferent manners, produces different effects. It appears to me,\r\ntherefore, a vain attempt to assign a theory of the winds, for which\r\nreason I shall limit myself to the study of their history.\r\n\r\nIf we could have a course of observations on the direction, power,\r\nand variation of the wind in different climates; if this course of\r\nobservations was exact and extensive enough for us to perceive the\r\nresult of these vicissitudes of the air in every country, we should\r\narrive at that degree of knowledge, from which at present we are very\r\nremote; but a short time has passed since meteorological observations\r\nhave been made, and possibly much more will pass before we know how to\r\nemploy the results of them, although they are the only means that we\r\nhave to arrive at some positive knowledge on this subject.\r\n\r\nOn the sea the winds are more regular than on land, because the sea\r\nis an open space, in which nothing opposes their direction, while on\r\nland mountains, forests, and towns, form obstacles which change their\r\ncourse. Winds reflected by the mountains are often as impetuous as in\r\ntheir first direction: these winds are very irregular, because their\r\ncourse depends on the size, height, and situation of the mountains\r\nwhich reflect them. The sea winds blow with greater power than the\r\nland winds, are not so variable, and last longer. Land winds, however\r\nviolent, have moments of remission, and sometimes of quiet, but at sea\r\ntheir currents are constant and continual, without any interruption.\r\n\r\nIn general on the sea the east wind, and those which come from the\r\npoles, are stronger than the west and those which proceed from the\r\nequator. On the land the west and south winds are more or less violent,\r\naccording to the situation of the climates. In spring and autumn all\r\nwinds are more violent than in summer or winter, and for these reasons;\r\nfirst, in spring and autumn are the highest tides, and consequently\r\nthe winds that these tides produce are most violent at those seasons;\r\nsecondly, the motion which the action of the sun and moon produce in\r\nthe air is also greater in the season of the equinoxes; thirdly, the\r\nmelting of the snows in spring, and the condensation of the vapours\r\nthat the sun raises during summer, which refall in plentiful rains\r\nduring autumn, produce, or at least increase the wind; fourthly, the\r\nchange from heat to cold, or from cold to heat, cannot be made without\r\nincreasing and diminishing consequently the volume of air, which alone\r\nmust produce very high winds.\r\n\r\nContrary currents are often observed in the air; some clouds move in\r\none direction, while others, which are higher or lower, move in a\r\ndirectly opposite one; but this contrariety of motion does not remain,\r\nbeing commonly produced by the resistance of some large clouds that\r\nforce the wind into another course, but which returns again as soon as\r\nthe obstacle is dissipated.\r\n\r\nThe winds are more violent in mountainous places than in plains, and\r\nincrease until we reach the common height of the clouds, that is to\r\nsay, to about one quarter, or one third of a league perpendicular\r\nheight; beyond that height the sky is generally serene, at least during\r\nthe summer, and the wind gradually diminishing. It is even asserted to\r\nbe quite insensible at the summit of the highest mountains; but these\r\nsummits being covered with snow and ice, it is natural to suppose that\r\nthis region of air is agitated by the wind when the snow falls, and\r\nonly during summer that the winds are not to be perceived. In summer\r\nthe light vapours which are raised above the summit of these mountains\r\nfall in the form of dew, whereas in winter they condense and fall in\r\nsnow or ice, which in winter may raise considerable winds, even at that\r\nheight.\r\n\r\nA current of air increases in velocity where the space of its passage\r\nis straitened: the same wind which was moderate in an open plain\r\nbecomes violent in passing through a narrow passage in a mountain, or\r\nbetween two lofty buildings; and its most violent action is at the top\r\nof these structures or mountains, for air being compressed by these\r\nobstacles, its density and mass becomes increased, and as the velocity\r\nremains, the force or momentum of the wind naturally becomes much\r\nstronger. This is the cause that near a church or castle the winds seem\r\nto be stronger than at a distance from them. I have often remarked,\r\nthat the wind reflected from a lone building is more violent than the\r\ndirect wind which produced it. This can only be occasioned by the\r\nimpelled air being compressed against the building, and by that means\r\nadds to its force.\r\n\r\nThe density of the air being greatest at the surface of the earth, we\r\nmight be led to imagine that the greatest action of the wind should be\r\nthere also; and I indeed think this is really the case when the sky is\r\nserene; but when it is covered with clouds, the most violent action\r\nof the wind is at the height of these clouds, which generally fall in\r\nrain or snow. The strength of the wind, therefore, must be estimated,\r\nnot only by the velocity, but also by the density of the air; for it\r\nwill often happen that one wind, which shall have no more velocity than\r\nanother, will, nevertheless, root up trees and overturn buildings,\r\nonly from the air impelled by this wind being denser; and this evinces\r\nthe imperfection of the machines invented to measure the velocity of\r\nthe wind.\r\n\r\nParticular winds, whether direct or reflected, are more violent than\r\ngeneral ones. The interrupted action of land-winds depends on the\r\ncompression of the air, which renders each blast much more violent than\r\nif the wind blowed uniformly. A strong continued wind never occasions\r\nsuch disasters as the rage of those produce which blow, as it were, by\r\nfits; but we shall give examples thereof in the following article.\r\n\r\nWe may consider the winds, and their directions, under general points\r\nof view, from which possibly we may derive useful instructions; for\r\nexample, we might divide the winds into zones. The east wind, which\r\nextends to about 25 or 30 degrees on each side the equator, exerts its\r\naction round the globe in the torrid zone; the north wind almost always\r\nas constantly in the frigid zones. Therefore it may be said that the\r\neast wind occupies the torrid zone, the north wind the frigid zones,\r\nand with respect to the temperate zone, the winds which reign there are\r\nmerely currents of air produced by these two winds, whose direction\r\ntends to the eastern points. With respect to the westerly winds, which\r\noften reign in the temperate zones, both in the Pacific and Atlantic\r\nOceans, they may be regarded as winds reflected by the lands of Asia\r\nand America, deriving their origin from the east and north winds.\r\n\r\nAlthough we have said that, generally speaking, the east winds reign\r\naround the globe to about 25 or 30 degrees on each side the equator,\r\nit is nevertheless certain, that in some parts they do not extend so\r\nfar, and their direction is not always from east to west, for on this\r\nside the equator it is east-north-east, and beyond the equator it is\r\neast-south-east, and the further we remove from the equator the more\r\nthe direction is oblique. The equator is the line under which the\r\ndirection of the wind from east to west is the most exact; for example,\r\nin the Indian ocean, the general wind from east to west scarcely\r\nextends beyond 15 degrees. Sailing from Goa to the Cape of Good Hope\r\nthis wind is not felt till we have past the equator; but after arriving\r\nat the 12th degree south latitude, it continues to the 28th degree. In\r\nthe sea which divides Africa from America there is an interval from\r\nthe 4th degree north latitude to the 10th or 11th degree south, where\r\nthis general wind is not perceivable; but beyond the 10th or 11th\r\ndegree it reigns as far as the 30th.\r\n\r\nThere is also much exception with regard to the trade winds, whose\r\nmotion is alternative. Some remain a longer or a shorter time, others\r\nextend to greater or less distances; others are more or less regular,\r\nand more or less violent. Varenius speaks thus of a principal phenomena\r\nof these winds. \"In the ocean between Africa and India, as far as\r\nthe Malaccas, the east winds begin to reign in January and last to\r\nthe beginning of June; in August or September the west winds begin\r\nand continue during three or four months. In the interval of these\r\nmonsoons, that is from the end of June to the beginning of August,\r\nthere is no wind on that sea, but they have violent storms which come\r\nfrom the north.\r\n\r\n\"These winds are subject to the greatest variations near the land, for\r\nships cannot depart from the Malabar coast, nor other western ports on\r\nthe coasts of the peninsula of India, to sail to Africa, Arabia, or\r\nPersia, but from January to April or May; for from the end of May, and\r\nduring the months of June, July, and August, there are such violent\r\ntempests from the north or north-east that ships are not able to keep\r\nthe sea. On the other side of this peninsula, in the sea which bathes\r\nthe Coromandel coast, these tempests are not known.\r\n\r\n\"To sail from Java, Ceylon, and many other places, to the Malacca\r\nislands, the month of September is the most proper time, because the\r\nwest wind begins to blow in these parts; nevertheless, at 15 degrees\r\nsouth of the equator, we lose this west wind and meet with the general\r\nwinds, which blow south-east. To sail from Cochin to Malacca they\r\ndepart in March, because the west winds begin to blow at that time;\r\ntherefore these westerly winds blow at different times in different\r\nparts of the Indian sea; and it is necessary to sail at different\r\nperiods in going from Java to the Malaccas, from Cochin to Malacca,\r\nfrom Malacca to China, and from China to Japan.\r\n\r\n\"At Banda, the west winds finish at the end of March, calms reign\r\nduring April, in May the east winds begin again with great violence.\r\nAt Ceylon, the west winds begin about the middle of March, and remain\r\ntill the beginning of October, when the east or rather north-east wind\r\nreturns. At Madagascar, from the middle of April to the end of May, the\r\nnorth and north-west winds are constant; but in February and March,\r\nthe east and south winds reign. From Madagascar to the Cape of Good\r\nHope, the north and collateral winds blow during March and April. In\r\nthe Gulph of Bengal, the south wind prevails after the 20th of April,\r\nbefore which time the south-west or north-west winds are predominant.\r\nThe west winds are also violent in the sea of China, in June and July,\r\nwhich is likewise the most suitable season to go from China to Japan;\r\nbut to return from Japan to China, February and March are preferred,\r\nbecause the east or north-east winds prevail.\r\n\r\n\"There are winds which may be regarded as peculiar to certain coasts;\r\nfor example, the south wind is almost continually on the coasts of\r\nChili and Peru; it begins at the 46th degree south latitude, and\r\nextends beyond Panama, which renders the voyage from Lima to Panama\r\nmuch easier performed than the return. The west wind blows continually\r\non the Magellanic coasts, and in the straits of Le Maire. The north and\r\nnorth-west winds almost continually reign on the Malabar coast. The\r\nnorth-west wind is very frequent on the coast of Guinea. The westerly\r\nwinds reign on the coasts of Japan, in the months of November and\r\nDecember.\"\r\n\r\nThe alternative, or periodical winds, which we have just been speaking\r\nof, are sea winds; but there are also land winds which are periodical,\r\nand return either at a certain season, or in certain days, or even at\r\ncertain hours; for example, on the Malabar coast, from September to\r\nApril a land wind blows from the eastern side; it generally commences\r\nat midnight, and finishes at noon, and is not felt beyond 12 or 15\r\nleagues from the coast; and from noon till midnight a gentle wind blows\r\nfrom the west. On the coast of New Spain, in America, and on that of\r\nCongo, in Africa, land winds reign during the night, and sea winds\r\nduring the day. At Jamaica the winds blow from all parts of the coast\r\nat once during the night, and therefore vessels cannot go in, nor\r\ndepart from it with safety, but in the day time.\r\n\r\nIn winter the port of Cochin is not to be entered, nor can any vessel\r\nquit it, because the winds blow with such impetuosity, that ships\r\ncannot remain at sea; and besides the west winds, which blow with such\r\nfury, bring to the mouth of the river so great a quantity of sand as\r\nprevents the possibility of ships of any size from entering it during\r\nsix months of the year; but the east winds which blow during the other\r\nsix months repel these sands, and render the entrance of the river\r\nfree. At the strait of Babelmandel there are south-east winds which\r\nreign throughout the season, and are always succeeded by north-east. At\r\nSt. Domingo there are two different winds which regularly rise almost\r\nevery day, the one a sea wind proceeding from the east, and commences\r\nat 10 o'clock in the morning; the other a land wind comes from the\r\nwest, rises at six or seven o'clock in the evening, and remains all\r\nnight. There are many other facts of this nature to be extracted from\r\ntravellers, the knowledge of which might perhaps lead to a history\r\nof the winds, which would be a useful work equally to navigation and\r\nphysics.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARTICLE XV.\r\n\r\n  OF IRREGULAR WINDS, HURRICANES, AND OTHER PHENOMENA, CAUSED BY THE\r\n  AGITATION OF THE SEA AND AIR.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe winds are more irregular on the land than on the sea, and in high\r\nplaces than in low. The mountains not only alter the direction of\r\nwinds, but even produce some which are either constant or variable\r\naccording to different causes. The melting of snow upon the summits of\r\nmountains, generally produces constant winds, which sometimes remain a\r\nconsiderable time; the vapours that are stopt by mountains accumulate\r\nthere, and produce variable winds, very frequent in all climates:\r\nand there are as many variations in the motions of air, as there\r\nare inequalities on the surface of the earth. We can therefore give\r\nonly examples, and relate circumstances which are attested; and as we\r\nare deficient in a course of observations on the variation of winds,\r\nand even of the seasons in different countries, we do not pretend to\r\nexplain all the causes of these differences, but confine ourselves to\r\nthose which appear the most probable.\r\n\r\nIn straits, on all projecting coasts, at the extremity of all\r\npromontories, peninsulas and capes, and in all narrow bays, storms are\r\nfrequent; but without these there are some seas much more tempestuous\r\nthan others. The Indian ocean, the Japan and the Magellan seas, that of\r\nthe African coast beyond the Canaries, and on the other side towards\r\nthe coast of Natal and the Red Sea, are very liable to storms. The\r\nAtlantic is more stormy than the ocean, which from its tranquillity is\r\ncalled the Pacific Sea; this sea, however, is not absolutely tranquil,\r\nexcept between the tropics, for the nearer we approach the poles,\r\nthe more we are subject to variable winds, whose sudden changes are\r\nfrequently the cause of tempests.\r\n\r\nAll continents are subject to variable winds, which often produce\r\nsingular effects; in the kingdom of Cassimir, which is surrounded by\r\nthe mountain of Caucasus, at the mountain Pirepinjale, extraordinary\r\nand sudden changes are experienced; we pass, in less than an hour's\r\ntravelling, from summer to winter; at this place are two winds, a\r\nnorth and south, and which, according to Bernier, we successively feel\r\nin less than 200 feet distance from each other; the position of this\r\nmountain must be singular, and merit observation. In the peninsula of\r\nIndia, which is crossed from north to south by the mountains of Gate,\r\nit is winter on one side, and summer on the other at the same time.\r\nThe like difference is met with on the two sides of Rozalgate Cape in\r\nArabia; the sea to the north of the cape is perfectly tranquil, while\r\nin the south violent tempests are experienced. It is the same in the\r\nisland of Ceylon; winter and high winds are experienced in the northern\r\nparts of the island, while in the southern there is fine summer\r\nweather. This contrariety of seasons at the same time not only happens\r\nin many parts of the Indian continent, but also in many islands; for\r\nexample, at Cerem, a long island in the vicinage of Amboyna, they\r\nhave winter in the northern part, and summer at the same time in the\r\nsouthern, and the interval that divides the two seasons is not above\r\nthree or four leagues.\r\n\r\nIn Egypt they have a south wind in summer, so hot as to prevent\r\nrespiration, and raises such great quantities of sand, that the sky\r\nseems covered with thick clouds; this sand is so fine, and driven with\r\nsuch force, that it penetrates even into the closest chests. When these\r\nwinds last many days they cause epidemical diseases, which are often\r\nfollowed by a great mortality. It seldom rains in Egypt, nevertheless\r\nevery year there are some days of rain in the months of December,\r\nJanuary, and February. Thick mists are more frequent there than rain,\r\nespecially in the environs of Cairo; these mists begin in November,\r\nand continue all the winter; and during the whole year there falls so\r\nplentiful a dew, even when the sky is serene, that it might be taken\r\nfor a slight rain.\r\n\r\nIn Persia winter begins in November and lasts till March: the cold\r\nis intense enough to form ice: much snow falls on the mountains, and\r\noften a little in the plains. From March to May the winds blows with\r\ngreat violence, and bring heat with them. From May to September, the\r\nsky is serene, and the heat moderated by fresh breezes, which rise\r\nevery evening and remain till morning. In autumn they have violent\r\nwinds, like those of the spring; nevertheless, although these winds\r\nare very violent they scarcely ever produce tempests or hurricanes;\r\nbut in summer there often arises along the Persian Gulph a very\r\ndangerous wind, called by the natives Samuel; it is still hotter and\r\nmore terrible than that of Egypt. This wind is mortal, and acting\r\nlike an inflamed vapour, it suffocates every person unfortunately\r\nenveloped within its vortex. In summer there also rises a wind of the\r\nsame kind along the Red Sea, which suffocates men and cattle, and\r\nwhich conveys so great a quantity of sand that many persons conceive\r\nthis sea will in time be choaked up with what falls therein. There\r\nare often clouds of sand in Arabia which darken the air and form\r\ndangerous whirlwinds. At Veru Cruz, when the hot north winds blow, the\r\nhouses of the town are almost buried under the sand. In summer hot\r\nwinds rise also at Negapatam, in the peninsula of India, likewise at\r\nPetapouli and Masulapatan. These burning winds, which destroy people,\r\nare fortunately of short duration, but they are very violent, and the\r\ngreater swiftness they come with the more dreadful are their heats,\r\nwhereas all other winds refresh so much the more as their velocity is\r\ngreater. This difference proceeds from the degree of heat in the air,\r\nfor while the heat of the air is not so great as that of the body of\r\nanimals, the motion of the air is refreshing; but if the heat of the\r\nair exceeds that of the body, then its motion heats and burns. At\r\nGoa the winter, or rather the rainy and tempestuous season, is May,\r\nJune, and July, and without which rains the heat would be perfectly\r\nunsupportable in that country.\r\n\r\nThe Cape of Good Hope is famous for its tempests, and the singular\r\ncloud which produces them. This cloud appears at first like a small\r\nround spot in the sky, called by the sailors the Ox's Eye. Probably its\r\nappearing so minute is owing to its exceeding great height.\r\n\r\nOf all travellers who have spoken of this cloud, Kolbe appears to have\r\nthe most examined it with attention; his words are, \"The cloud seen\r\non the mountains of the Table, or of the Devil, or of the Wind, is\r\ncomposed, if I am not deceived, of an infinity of small particles,\r\nimpelled first against the mountains of the Cape towards the east,\r\nby the easterly wind which blows during almost the whole year in the\r\ntorrid zone; these particles are stopt in their course by these high\r\nmountains, and collect on their eastern side; they then become visible\r\nand form these assemblages of clouds, which being incessantly driven\r\nby the east wind, rise to the summit of these mountains; they do not\r\nlong remain there at rest, but being obliged to advance, they ingulph\r\nthemselves between the hills before them, where they are bound and\r\nconfined as in a canal; the wind presses them from above, and the\r\nopposite sides of the two mountains retain them in a direct line: in\r\nadvancing they arrive at the foot of a mountain, where the country is\r\na little more open, they then expand, and become again invisible; but\r\nthey are shortly driven against other mountains, by clouds which are\r\nbehind them, and thus proceed with much impetuosity, until they arrive\r\nat the highest mountains of the Cape, which are those of the Wind, or\r\nTable, where they have to encounter a wind blowing in an exact contrary\r\ndirection; this occasions a dreadful conflict, for the vapours being\r\nimpelled behind and repelled before, produce horrible whirlwinds\r\neither on the high mountains of the Table, or adjacent vallies. When\r\nthe north-west wind yields, the south-east increases and continues to\r\nblow with more or less violence for six months, it reinforces itself\r\nwhile the cloud of the Ox's Eye is thick, because the vapours collected\r\nbehind press forward, and it diminishes as soon as its thickness is\r\nlessened, because there are fewer particles and less pressure, and it\r\nis entirely lowered when the Ox's Eye is no longer apparent, because no\r\nnew or not sufficient vapours any longer come from the east.\r\n\r\n\"All the circumstances attending this phenomenon lead to an hypothesis,\r\nwhich well explains every part of them: First, behind the mountain of\r\nthe Table we remark a train of light white mists, which commencing on\r\nthe eastern descent of this mountain, incline to the sea, and occupy\r\nthe mountains of Stone throughout all their extent; I have often\r\ncontemplated this train, which according to my opinion was caused by\r\nthe rapid passage of the vapour above-mentioned, from the mountains of\r\nStone to that of the Table.\r\n\r\n\"Secondly, These vapours must be extremely embarrassed in their road,\r\nby the frequent shocks and counter shocks caused, not only by the\r\nmountains, but also by the south and east winds which reign at places\r\ncircumjacent to the Cape: I have already spoken of the two mountains\r\ncalled Hanging Lip and Norvege, situate on the points of False Bay;\r\nwhen the particles which I conceive are impelled on these mountains by\r\nthe easterly winds, they are repelled from them by the south, which\r\ncarry them on the neighbouring mountains; they are stopt there and\r\nappear like clouds, which is often the case upon the mountains of\r\nFalse Bay. These clouds are frequently very thick above the land which\r\nthe Dutch are in possession of, on the mountains of Stenltenborch, of\r\nDrakenstein, and Stone, but particularly on the mountains of the Table,\r\nand of the Devil.\r\n\r\n\"In short, what confirms me in my opinion is, that constantly two or\r\nthree days before the south-east wind blows on the Lion's Head, small\r\nblack clouds are perceived above it; these clouds, according to my\r\nopinion, are composed of the particles or vapours which I have spoken\r\nof. If the north-west wind prevails when they arrive there, they are\r\nstopped in their course, but are never driven to a great distance till\r\nthe south-east winds commence.\"\r\n\r\nThe first mariners who approached the Cape of Good Hope were ignorant\r\nof the effects of these clouds, which appear to form in the air so\r\nslowly, and without any motion, but which in a moment excite the most\r\ndreadful storms that precipitate the largest vessels to the bottom of\r\nthe sea. In the country of Natal, a small cloud similar to the Ox's\r\nEye at the Cape, produces the like effects. In the sea between Africa\r\nand America, especially near the equator, these kind of tempests very\r\noften arise. Near the coast of Guinea, three or four of these storms\r\nsometimes happen in a day; they are also caused and announced by small\r\nblack clouds; the rest of the sky being generally serene, and the sea\r\nperfectly calm. The first blast which issues from these clouds is\r\nfurious, and would sink ships in open sea, if they did not take the\r\nprecaution to furl the sails. It is principally in April, May, and\r\nJune these tempests are experienced on the coast of Guinea, because no\r\nregular wind blows there. The stormy season on the coasts of Loango is\r\nin January, February, March, and April. On the other side of Africa,\r\nat Cape of Gardafu, these kinds of tempests rise in May, and the clouds\r\nwhich produce them are generally in the north like those of the Cape of\r\nGood Hope.\r\n\r\nAll these tempests are produced by winds which issue from a cloud,\r\nand which have directions either from north to south, or north-east\r\nto south-west, &c. but there are other kinds which are still more\r\nviolent, and in which the winds seem to proceed from every quarter at\r\nonce; they have a whirling motion, which nothing can resist. A calm\r\ngenerally precedes these horrible tempests; but in an instant the fury\r\nof the winds raises the waves as high as the clouds. There are parts\r\nof the sea which cannot be approached, from there being constantly\r\ncalms and hurricanes in them. The Spaniards have called these places\r\nCalms and Tornados; the most considerable are near Guinea, at two or\r\nthree degrees north latitude; they are 300 or 350 leagues in length by\r\nas many in breadth, which forms a space of more than 100,000 leagues\r\nsquare.\r\n\r\nWhen contrary winds come all at once in the same place, as to a centre,\r\nthey produce whirlwinds by the contrariety of their motions; but when\r\nthese winds meet with others in opposition, which counterbalance their\r\naction, they then revolve in a considerable circle, and occasion a dead\r\ncalm, through which it is impossible for vessels to make their way.\r\nThese places of the sea are marked in Senex's globes. I am inclined\r\nto think that the contrariety of the winds alone could not produce\r\nthis effect if the direction of the coasts, and the particular form of\r\nthe bottom of the sea, did not contribute thereto. I imagine that the\r\ncurrents caused by the winds, but directed by the form of the coasts\r\nand the inequalities of the bottom of the sea, end at these places, and\r\nthat their opposite and contrary direction, in a plain surrounded on\r\nall sides by a chain of mountains, is the real cause of these tornados.\r\n\r\nWhirlpools appear to be no other than the eddies of the water formed\r\nby the action of two or more opposite currents. The Euripus, so famous\r\nfor the death of Aristotle, alternately absorbs and rejects the water\r\nseven times in twenty-four hours. This whirlpool is near the Grecian\r\ncoast. The Charybdis, which is near the straits of Sicily, rejects and\r\nabsorbs the water thrice in twenty-four hours. We are not quite certain\r\nas to the number of alternative motions in these whirlpools. Doctor\r\nPlacentia, in his treatise, says, that the Euripus has irregular\r\nmotions for eighteen or nineteen days every month, and regular ones\r\nfor the other eleven; that in general it swells about one foot, and\r\nseldom two: he says likewise that authors do not agree as to the tides\r\nof the Euripus; that some assert it is twice, some seven, others\r\nfourteen times in twenty-four hours, but that Loirius having examined\r\nit attentively, observed it rose regularly every six hours, and with so\r\nviolent a motion, that it was sufficient to turn the wheel of a mill.\r\n\r\nThe greatest known whirlpool is that in the Norway sea, which is\r\naffirmed to be upwards of twenty leagues in circumference. It absorbs\r\nfor six hours water, whales, ships, and every thing that comes near it,\r\nand afterwards returns them in the same quantity of time as it drew\r\nthem in.\r\n\r\nIt is not necessary to suppose there are holes and abysses in the\r\nbottom of the sea which swallow up the waters continually; to assign\r\na reason for whirlpools, it is well known that when water has two\r\ncontrary directions, the combination of these motions produce a\r\nwhirling, and seem to form a void place in the centre. It is the same\r\nwith respect to whirlpools in the sea, they are produced by two or\r\nthree contrary currents; and as the flux and reflux, which run every\r\nsix hours in contrary directions, are the principal cause of currents,\r\nit is not astonishing that whirlpools, which result from them, attract\r\nand swallow up all that surrounds them, and afterwards reject all they\r\nhave absorbed in the same portion of time.\r\n\r\nWhirlpools, therefore, are produced by opposite currents, and likewise\r\nby the meeting of contrary winds. These whirlwinds are common in the\r\nsea of China and Japan, near the Antilles, and in many other parts of\r\nthe sea, particularly near projecting lands and high coasts; but they\r\nare still more frequent upon land, and their effects are sometimes\r\nprodigious. \"I have seen,\" says Bellarmin, \"an enormous ditch dug up\r\nby the wind, and the earth thereof carried to a distance; so that the\r\nplace from whence it had been taken appeared a frightful hole, and the\r\nvillage upon which it was dropped was entirely buried with it.\"\r\n\r\nIn the history of the French Academy, and in the Philosophical\r\nTransactions, are the detail of the effects of many hurricanes, which\r\nappear inconceivable and scarcely credible, if the facts were not\r\nattested by a great number of intelligent testimonies.\r\n\r\nIt is the same with respect to water-spouts, which mariners never see\r\nwithout fear and amazement; these are very frequent near certain coasts\r\nof the Mediterranean, especially when the sky is cloudy and the wind\r\nblows at the same time from various coasts. They are more common near\r\nthe coasts of Laodicea, Grecgo and Carmel, than in other parts of the\r\nMediterranean. Most of them are large cylinders of water which fall\r\nfrom the clouds, although it appears, when we are at some distance,\r\nthat the water of the sea rises up to the clouds.[G]\r\n\r\n[G] See Shaw's Travels, vol. 2. p. 56.\r\n\r\nBut there are two kinds of water-spouts, the first of which, alluded to\r\nabove, is no other than a thick compressed cloud, reduced to a small\r\nspace by contrary winds, which, blowing at the same time from many\r\ncorners, give it a cylindric form, and causes the water to fall by its\r\nown weight. The quantity of water is so great, and the fall so sudden\r\nand precipitate, that if unfortunately one of these spouts breaks\r\non a vessel, it shatters it to pieces and sinks it in an instant.\r\nIt is asserted, and possibly with foundation, that these spouts\r\nmay be broken and destroyed by the commotion which the firing of\r\ncannons excites in the air; which answers to the effect of dispersing\r\nthunder-clouds by the ringing of bells.\r\n\r\nThe other kind of water-spout is called a typhon, which many authors\r\nhave confounded with the hurricane, in speaking of the storms of the\r\nChinese sea, which is in fact subject to both. The typhon does not\r\ndescend from the clouds, but rises up from the sea with great violence.\r\nBy whirlwinds, sands, earth, houses, trees, and animals, are raised\r\nin the air, and transported to different parts; but typhons, on the\r\ncontrary, remain in the same place, and can only have subterraneous\r\nfires for their origin; for the sea is then in the greatest agitation,\r\nand the air so strongly filled with sulphurous exhalations, that the\r\nsky appears covered with a copper-coloured crust, although there are no\r\nclouds, and the sun or stars may be seen through the vapour. It is to\r\nthese subterraneous fires the warmth of the sea of China in winter must\r\nbe attributed, as these typhons are there very frequent.[H]\r\n\r\n[H] See Acta Eud. Lips. Supplementum, vol. 1. p. 405.\r\n\r\nThevenot, in his voyage to the Levant, says, \"we saw water-spouts in\r\nthe Persian gulph, between the islands Quesomo, Lareca, and Ormutz. I\r\nthink few people have considered water-spouts with so much attention as\r\nI have done. I shall mention my remarks with all possible simplicity,\r\nin order to render them plain and easy to be comprehended.\r\n\r\n\"The first that we saw appeared on the northern coast, between us\r\nand the island Quesomo, about a gun-shot from the ship: we directly\r\nperceived the water boiled on the surface of the sea, and was raised\r\nabout a foot: it was whitish, and the top appeared like a thick black\r\nsmoke, so that it properly resembled some burning straw, which only\r\nsmoked. It made a noise like a torrent that runs with rapidity into a\r\ndeep valley. This noise was mixed with another, similar to the hissing\r\nof serpents: a little afterwards we perceived something like a dark\r\npipe, which resembled smoke ascending towards the clouds, turning\r\nround with great velocity: this appeared about the thickness of my\r\nfinger, and the same noise still continued. After this it disappeared,\r\nhaving remained somewhat less than a quarter of an hour. This over, we\r\nperceived another on the south side, which began in the same manner\r\nas the preceding: directly after a third made its appearance on the\r\nwest, and then a fourth by its side. The farthest of them was not\r\nmore than a musket-shot from us. They all appeared like burning heaps\r\nof straw, a foot and a half or two feet high, and were attended with\r\nthe same noise as the first. We afterwards saw three pipes or canals\r\ndescending from the clouds to the water. They were broad at the top\r\nand lessened downwards, something in the shape of a trumpet, or as\r\nthe paps of an animal, drawn perpendicularly down by a heavy weight.\r\nThese canals appeared of a darkish white, occasioned, as I think, by\r\nthe waters which were in them; for apparently they were formed before\r\nthe water entered, as when they were empty they were no longer to be\r\nseen, like as a clear glass tube placed at some distance before our\r\neyes, is not perceptible if it is not filled with some coloured liquor.\r\nThese pipes were not strait but crooked in some places; they were not\r\neven perpendicular, but from the clouds, where they were joined, to\r\nthe parts which drew in the water, they were very much bent; and what\r\nis more particular, the cloud, to which the second of the three was\r\nfastened, having been driven by the wind, this pipe followed it without\r\nbreaking or quitting the place where it drew in the water, and passing\r\nbehind the first, they had for some time the form of St. Andrew's\r\ncross. At the beginning neither of them was more than an inch in\r\nthickness, excepting just at the top, but afterwards the first of the\r\nthree increased considerably. The two others scarcely remained longer\r\nthan that which we saw on the north side. The second, on the south\r\nside, remained about a quarter of an hour, but the first on that side\r\nremained longer, and gave us some apprehensions. At first it was not\r\nbigger than my finger, afterwards it swelled as thick as my arm, then\r\nas my leg, and at last as the trunk of a large tree, which a man might\r\nencompass with both his arms. We distinctly perceived water through\r\nthis transparent body, which ascended in a serpentine manner. Sometimes\r\nit diminished in size at the top, and sometimes at the bottom, then\r\nit exactly resembled a tube with some fluid matter pressed with the\r\nfingers, either above to make this liquor descend, or at bottom to\r\ncause it to ascend; and I am persuaded that it was the violence of\r\nthe wind which caused these changes, pressing the pipe in a similar\r\nmanner. After this it diminished less than my arm, then returned as\r\nlarge as my thigh, and then again became very small; at last I saw the\r\nwater that was raised from the surface began to lower, and the end of\r\nthe pipe divided from it, when, by the change of light from a cloud,\r\nit was lost to our sight; I continued, however, to observe whether\r\nit returned, because I had remarked that the pipe of the second had\r\nappeared to be broken in the middle, and directly after we saw it\r\nwhole. This we found was occasioned by the light which hid the half\r\nfrom us, but the last we saw no more.\r\n\r\n\"These water-spouts are very dangerous, for if they fall on a vessel\r\nthey entangle in the sails so much that sometimes they raise it up,\r\nand afterwards let it fall with such violence as to sink it; at least\r\nif they do not lift the vessel up, they tear all the sails, or let the\r\nwater they contain fall on it, and which often sinks it to the bottom.\r\nThere cannot be the least doubt but it is by similar accidents that\r\nmany ships, of which we have heard no accounts, have been lost, since\r\nthere are but few examples of those that we have known, from certainty,\r\nto have perished in this manner.\"\r\n\r\nI suspect there are many optical illusions in the above account, but\r\nI have recounted them as related, in order that we might compare\r\nthem with those of other travellers. The following description is by\r\nM. Gentil, in his voyage round the world. \"At eleven o'clock in the\r\nmorning, the air being filled with clouds, we perceived about our\r\nvessel, at a quarter of a mile distant, six water-spouts, which made\r\na noise similar to that of water flowing in subterraneous canals, and\r\nincreased until it resembled the whistling which an impetuous wind\r\nmakes among the cordage of a ship. We at first observed the water to\r\nboil up about a foot and a half above the surface. Above this boiling\r\nthere appeared a mixed or rather a thick smoke, which formed a kind of\r\ncanal, that ascended to the clouds. These canals inclined according as\r\nthe wind moved the clouds to which they were attached, and in spite of\r\nthe wind's impulsion they not only adhered to them, but even lengthened\r\nand shortened themselves in proportion as the clouds rose higher or\r\nlower in the atmosphere.\r\n\r\n\"These phenomena terrified us greatly, and our sailors, instead of\r\nbeing bolder, fomented their fears by the dismal tales they told each\r\nother. If these spouts, said they, fall on our vessel, they will lift\r\nher up, and then she will sink by the violence of her fall. Others\r\ncontended in a decisive tone, that they would not raise the vessel\r\nup, but if they met it in their course, being full of water, the ship\r\nwould break the communication they had with the sea, and the whole body\r\nof the water would fall perpendicularly on the deck of the vessel and\r\nsplit her to pieces.\r\n\r\n\"To prevent this misfortune the cannon was loaded, the sailors\r\npretending the report of a cannon, by agitating the air, dissipated\r\nthese phenomena; but we had no need of having recourse to this remedy,\r\nfor when they had run about ten minutes about the ship, some at a\r\nquarter of a league, others at a less distance, we perceived the canals\r\nto grow narrower by degrees, till they got loose from the surface of\r\nthe sea and then dissipated.\"\r\n\r\nIt appears from the description given by these two travellers, that\r\nwater-spouts are produced, at least in part, by the action of a fire or\r\nsmoke which rises from the bottom of the sea with great force, and that\r\nthey are quite different from those produced by contrary winds.\r\n\r\n\"The water-spouts, says Mr. Shaw, which I had an opportunity of seeing,\r\nappeared as so many cylinders of water, which fell from the clouds,\r\nalthough by the reflection of the columns which descend, or by the\r\ndrops which detach themselves from the water they contain, it sometimes\r\nseems, especially when we are at some distance, that the water is drawn\r\nup from the sea. To render a reason for this phenomena we may suppose\r\nthat the clouds being collected in one part by opposite winds, they\r\nforce them by pressing them with violence to condense and descend in\r\nthis manner.\"\r\n\r\nThere still remain many facts to be acquired before we can give a\r\ncomplete explanation of these phenomena; it appears to me, that if\r\nthere are under the waters of the sea, at particular places, soils\r\nmixed with sulphur, bitumen, and minerals, these matters may be\r\ninflamed and produce a great quantity of air, which being newly\r\ngenerated and prodigiously rarefied, ascends with rapidity, and may\r\nraise these water-spouts from the sea to the sky; so likewise if, by\r\ninflammation, the sulphurous matters which a cloud contains, a current\r\nof air is formed, which descends perpendicularly from the clouds\r\ntowards the sea, all its water may follow the current of air, and form\r\na water-spout which will fall from the sky upon the sea; but it must\r\nbe allowed that the explanation of this kind of water-spout, no more\r\nthan that we have given of those produced by contrary winds, is not\r\nsatisfactory; and it might be asked why these kinds of water-spouts,\r\nwhich fall perpendicularly from the clouds, are not as often seen on\r\nthe land as on the sea?\r\n\r\nThe History of the Academy, anno 1727, mentions a land water-spout\r\nwhich appeared at Capestan, near Beziers; it descended from a cloud\r\nlike a black pillar, which diminished by degrees, and at length\r\nterminated in a point upon the surface of the earth. It obeyed the wind\r\nwhich blew from west to south-west. It was accompanied with a very\r\nthick smoke, and made a similar noise to that of a troubled sea. It\r\ntore up and carried away trees to the distance of forty or fifty feet,\r\nmarking its way by a large track, on which three carriages might have\r\npassed each other. There appeared another pillar of the same kind, but\r\nwhich soon joined the first; and after the whole had disappeared, a\r\ngreat quantity of hail fell on the earth.\r\n\r\nThis kind of water-spout appears to be still different from the other\r\ntwo: it is not mentioned to have contained water; and it seems, by what\r\nI have related, and by the explanation given thereof by M. Andoque,\r\nto the academy, that this water-spout was only a whirlwind, rendered\r\nvisible by the dust and condensed vapours which it contained.\r\n\r\nIn the same history, anno 1741, a water-spout is spoken of, seen on the\r\nlake of Geneva; the upper part was inclined to a very black cloud, and\r\nthe lower, which was narrower, terminated a little above the water.\r\nThis phenomenon remained only a few minutes, and, at the moment it was\r\ndissipated, a thick vapour was perceived at the part where it first\r\nappeared; the waters of the lake boiled and seemed to make an effort\r\nto rise up. The air was very calm during the whole time; and when it\r\ndisappeared neither wind nor rain ensued. \"After all we are acquainted\r\nwith,\" says the historian of the academy, \"concerning water-spouts, is\r\nnot this another proof that they are not formed by the conflict of the\r\nwinds, but almost always produced by volcanos or subterraneous vapours,\r\nfrom which we know the bottom of the sea is not exempt? Whirlwinds\r\nand hurricanes, which we commonly thought to be the cause of these\r\nappearances, may possibly be only the effect, or an accidental event\r\nthereof.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARTICLE XVI.\r\n\r\nOF VOLCANOS AND EARTHQUAKES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe burning mountains, called volcanos, contain in their bowels,\r\nsulphur, bitumen, and other matters of an inflammable nature, the\r\neffects of which are more violent than that of gunpowder, or even\r\nthunder, and have from the earliest ages terrified mankind, and\r\ndesolated the country. A volcano is an immense cannon, whose orifice is\r\noften more than half a league: from this wide mouth are vomited forth\r\ntorrents of smoke and flames, rivers of bitumen, sulphur, and melted\r\nmetals, clouds of cinders and stones, and sometimes it ejects enormous\r\nrocks to many leagues distance, which human powers united could not\r\nmove; the conflagration is so terrible, and the quantity of burnt,\r\nmelted, calcined, and vitrified matters which the mountain throws\r\nout, is so great, that they destroy cities and forests, cover fields\r\nan hundred and two hundred feet in thickness, and sometimes form hills\r\nand mountains, which are only heaps of these matters piled up together.\r\nThe action of this fire, and the force of its explosion, is so violent,\r\nthat it produces by its re-action, succussions which shake the earth,\r\nagitate the sea, overthrow mountains, and destroy the most solid towers\r\nand edifices, even to very considerable distances.\r\n\r\nThese effects, although natural, have been looked upon as prodigies;\r\nand although we see in miniature, by fire, effects nearly similar to\r\nthose of volcanos, yet there is something in grandeur, of whatever\r\nnature it may be, that invariably strikes the imagination and\r\ninfluences the mind, and therefore I am not surprised that some authors\r\nhave taken them for the vents of a central fire, and ignorant people\r\nfor the mouths of Hell. Astonishment produces fear, and fear is the\r\nmother of superstition. The natives of Iceland imagine the roarings of\r\nthe volcano are the cries of the damned, and its eruptions the effects\r\nof the rage of devils, and the despair of the wretched.\r\n\r\nAll its effects, however, arise from fire and smoke: veins of sulphur,\r\nbitumen, and other inflammable matters, are found in the bowels of\r\nmountains, as well as minerals and pyrites, which ferment when exposed\r\nto air or humidity, and cause explosions proportionate to the quantity\r\nof inflamed matters. This is the just idea of a volcano, and it is easy\r\nfor a philosopher to imitate the action of these subterranean fires;\r\nfor by mixing together a quantity of brimstone and iron filings, and\r\nburying them in the earth to a certain depth, a small volcano may be\r\nproduced, whose effects will be exactly similar; for this mixture\r\ninflames by fermentation, throws off the earth and stones with which it\r\nis covered, and smokes, flames, and explodes like a real volcano.\r\n\r\nIn Europe are three famous volcanos, Mount Ætna, in Sicily, Mount\r\nHecla, in Iceland, and Mount Vesuvius, near Naples, in Italy. Mount\r\nÆtna has burnt from time immemorial, its eruptions are very violent,\r\nand the quantity of matter it throws out is so great that after digging\r\n68 feet deep, marble pavements, and the vestiges of an ancient town\r\nhave been found buried under this thickness of matter, in the same\r\nmanner as the city of Herculaneum has been covered by the matter\r\nthrown out from Vesuvius. New mouths in Ætna were opened in 1650,\r\n1669, and at other times. We see the flame and smoke of this volcano\r\nfrom Malta, about 60 leagues distance; it smokes continually, and\r\nthere are times when it vomits flames, stones, and matters of every\r\nkind with impetuosity. In 1537, there was an eruption of this volcano,\r\nwhich caused an earthquake in Sicily that continued for 12 days, and\r\nwhich overthrew a number of houses and public structures; it ceased\r\nby the opening of a new mouth, the lava from which burnt every thing\r\nwithin five leagues of the mountain. The cinders thrown out by the\r\nvolcano were so abundant, and ejected with so much force, that they\r\nwere driven as far as Italy; and vessels at some distance from Sicily\r\nwere incommoded by them. Farelli says the foot of this mountain is 100\r\nleagues in circumference.\r\n\r\nThis volcano has now two principal mouths, one narrower than the other;\r\nsmoke comes continually from them, but flames never issue but during\r\nthe time of eruptions; it is pretended that large stones have been\r\nthrown out by them to the distance of 60,000 feet.\r\n\r\nIn 1683 a violent eruption caused a terrible earthquake in Sicily; it\r\nentirely destroyed the town of Catanea, and killed more than 60,000\r\npersons in that town, besides those which were destroyed in the\r\nneighbouring towns and villages.\r\n\r\nHecla throws out its fires through the ice and snow of a frozen land;\r\nits eruptions are nevertheless as violent as those of Ætna, and other\r\nvolcanos of southern countries. It throws out cinders, lava, pumice\r\nstones, and sometimes boiling water: it is not inhabitable within\r\nsix leagues of this volcano, and the whole island of Iceland is very\r\nabundant in sulphur. The history of the violent eruptions of Hecla are\r\nrecorded by Dithmar Bleffken.\r\n\r\nMount Vesuvius, according to the historians, did not begin burning till\r\nthe seventh Consulate of Titus Vespasian and Falvius Domitian; the top\r\nbeing opened, it at first threw out stones and rocks, afterwards fire\r\nand lava, which burnt two neighbouring towns, and emitted such thick\r\nsmoke that it obscured the light of the sun. Pliny the elder, desirous\r\nof examining this conflagration nearer, was suffocated by the smoke.[I]\r\n\r\n[I] See the Epistle of Pliny, jun. to Tacitus.\r\n\r\nDion Cassius relates, that this eruption was so violent, that cinders\r\nand sulphurous smoke were driven as far as Rome, and even beyond the\r\nMediterranean into Africa. Heraclea was one of the two towns burned\r\nby this first conflagration of Vesuvius, which, in these latter times\r\nhas been discovered at more than 60 feet deep, the surface above which\r\nwas become, by length of time, arable land and fit for culture. The\r\nrelation of the discovery of Heraclea is in the hands of the public,\r\nand we can only wish that some person, versed in Natural History, would\r\nexamine the different matters which compose this soil of 60 feet,\r\nattending to their disposition and situation, the alterations they have\r\nproduced or suffered, the direction they have taken, and the hardness\r\nthey have acquired.\r\n\r\nThere is an appearance that Naples is situate on a hollow ground,\r\nfilled with burning materials, for Vesuvius and Solfatera seem to have\r\ninterior communications. When Vesuvius casts out lava Solfatera emits\r\nflames, and when the one ceases the other is extinguished. The city of\r\nNaples is situate nearly between them.\r\n\r\nOne of the last and most violent eruptions of Mount Vesuvius was in the\r\nyear 1737.[J] The mountain vomited, by several mouths, large torrents\r\nof burning metallic matters, which dispersed themselves over the\r\ncountry, and flowed into the sea. Mons. Montealegre, who communicated\r\nthis relation to the Academy of Sciences, observed, with horror, one of\r\nthese rivers of fire, whose length, from the mountain to the sea, was\r\nabout seven miles, its breadth about 60 feet, its depth 25 or 30 palms,\r\nand in bottoms or vallies 120: the matter which flowed was like the\r\nscum which issues from the furnace of a forge, &c.[K]\r\n\r\n[J] It should be remembered, as noticed by Mr. Smellie, that the\r\noriginal of this work was published by our author in 1749, since when\r\nVesuvius has undergone several eruptions.\r\n\r\n[K] See the Hist. Acad. an. 1737.\r\n\r\nIn Asia, particularly in the islands of the Indian ocean, there are\r\nmany volcanos; one of the most famous is Mount Albours, near Mount\r\nTaurus, eight leagues from Herat; its summit continually smokes, and\r\nit frequently throws out flames and burning matter in such quantities\r\nthat the surrounding country is covered with cinders. In the island of\r\nTernate there is a volcano which throws out matter like pumice-stones.\r\nSome travellers assert that this volcano is most furious at the time of\r\nthe equinoxes, because certain winds then reign there, which inflame\r\nthe matter that feeds, and has fed this fire for a number of years.[L]\r\n\r\n[L] See Argensola's Travels, vol. 1, page 21.\r\n\r\nThe island of Ternate is but seven leagues round, and is only the\r\nsummit of a mountain; it gradually ascends from the shore to the middle\r\nof the island, where the volcano rises to a considerable height, to\r\nthe top of which it is very difficult to attain. Many rills of sweet\r\nwater descend along the ridge of this mountain, and when the air is\r\ncalm, and the season mild, this burning gulph is in less agitation\r\nthan during storms and high winds.[M] This confirms what I have said\r\nin a former article, and seems to prove that the fire of volcanos does\r\nnot proceed from any considerable depth, but from the top, or at least\r\nnot far distant from the summit of the mountain; for if it was not so,\r\nthe high winds could not increase their combustion. There are other\r\nvolcanos in the Malaccas. In one of the Mauritius islands, 70 leagues\r\nfrom the Malaccas, there is a volcano, whose effects are as violent as\r\nthose of Mount Ternate. Sorca island, one of the Malaccas, was formerly\r\ninhabited. In the middle of this island there is a lofty mountain, with\r\na volcano at the top. In 1693 this volcano vomited bitumen and inflamed\r\nmatters in such a great quantity as to form a burning lake, and which\r\ncovered the whole island.[N]\r\n\r\n[M] See the Travels of Schuten.\r\n\r\n[N] See Phil. Trans. ab. vol. 11 page 391.\r\n\r\nAt Japan, and in the adjacent islands, there are several volcanos,\r\nwhich emit flames during the night and smoke in the day. At the\r\nPhilippine islands there are also burning mountains. One of the most\r\nfamous volcanos of the islands in the Indian ocean, and the most\r\nrecent, is that near the town of Panarucan, in the island of Java; it\r\nopened in 1586, and at the first eruption, it threw out an enormous\r\nquantity of sulphur, bitumen, and stones. The same year Mount Gounapi,\r\nin the island of Banda, which continued only seventeen years, opened\r\nand ejected, with a frightful noise, rocks and matters of every kind.\r\nThere are also some other volcanos in India, as at Sumatra, and in the\r\nnorth of Asia, but those are not considerable.\r\n\r\nIn Africa, there is a mountain, or rather a cavern, called\r\nBeniguazeval, near Fez, which always emits smoke, and sometimes flames.\r\nOne of the islands of Cape de Verd, called the Fuogo, is only a large\r\nmountain which burns continually; this volcano throws out cinders\r\nand stones; and the Portuguese, who have attempted several times to\r\nerect habitations in this island, have been constrained to abandon the\r\nproject through dread of the volcano. The Peak of Teneriffe, considered\r\nas one of the highest mountains of the earth, throws out fire, cinders,\r\nand large stones; from its top rivulets of melted sulphur flow across\r\nthe snow, where it forms veins that are distinguishable at a great\r\ndistance.\r\n\r\nIn America there are a great number of volcanos, particularly in the\r\nmountains of Peru and Mexico; that of Arequipa is one of the most\r\nfamous; it often causes earthquakes, which are more common in Peru\r\nthan in any other country in the world. The volcano of Carrappa and\r\nthat of Malahallo are, according to the report of travellers, the most\r\nconsiderable, next to that of Arequipa; but there are many others in\r\nthese parts of which we have no exact knowledge. M. Bouguer, in his\r\nvoyage to Peru, published in the Memoirs of the Academy of the year\r\n1744, mentions two volcanos, called Cotopaxi and Pichincha; the first\r\nat some distance from, the other near the town of Quito; he was witness\r\nof a conflagration of Botopaxi in 1742, and of the orifice which was\r\nmade in that mountain; this eruption did no other damage than melting\r\nthe snow and producing such torrents of water, that in less than three\r\nhours inundated a tract of country 18 leagues in extent, and overthrew\r\nall they met with in their way.\r\n\r\nAt Mexico the most considerable volcanos are Popochampeche, and the\r\nPopoatepec; it was near this last that Cortes passed in his voyage\r\nto Mexico; some of the Spaniards ascended to the top, where they saw\r\nthe mouth, which was about half a league in circumference. Sulphurous\r\nmountains are also met with at Guadaloupe, Tercera, and other islands\r\nof the Azores; and, if we were to consider as volcanos all those\r\nmountains which smoke, or emit flames, we might reckon more than sixty;\r\nwe have only spoken of those formidable volcanos, near which no person\r\ndares to inhabit.\r\n\r\nThese volcanos which are in such great numbers in the Cordeliers, as I\r\nhave formerly said, cause almost continual earthquakes, which prevent\r\nthe natives from building with stone above one story high, and to\r\nconstruct the upper stories of their houses with reeds and light wood.\r\nIn these mountains are also many precipices and large vents, the sides\r\nof which are black and burnt, as in the precipice of Mount Ararat, in\r\nArmenia, which is called the Abyss; these abysses are the mouths of\r\nextinguished volcanos.\r\n\r\nThere was lately an earthquake at Lima, the effects of which were\r\ndreadful. The town of Lima and Port Callao were almost entirely\r\nswallowed up; but the evil was still greater at Callao. The sea rose\r\nand covered every building in that town, drowned all the inhabitants,\r\nand left only one single tower remaining. Of twenty-five ships that\r\nwere in this port, four were carried a league upon land, and the rest\r\nwere swallowed up by the sea. At Lima, which was a large town, there\r\nremains only twenty-seven houses standing; a great number of persons\r\nwere buried in the ruins, particularly monks and religious persons, as\r\ntheir buildings were higher and constructed of more solid materials\r\nthan the other houses. This misfortune happened at night, in October\r\n1746; the shock remained fifteen minutes.\r\n\r\nThere was formerly near the port of Pisca, in Peru, a famous city,\r\nsituate on the sea shore, which was almost entirely destroyed by an\r\nearthquake that happened the 19th of October 1682, for the sea having\r\nextended beyond its common bounds, swallowed up this unfortunate place\r\nwith every person that was in it.\r\n\r\nIf we consult historians and travellers, we shall find relations of\r\nmany earthquakes and eruptions of volcanos, whose effects have been\r\nas terrible as those we have just mentioned. Pesidonius, whom Strabo\r\nquotes in his first book, relates, that a city in Phoenicia, near\r\nSidon, was swallowed up by an earthquake, with the neighbouring\r\nterritory, and even two thirds of Sidon; this effect was not so sudden\r\nbut that many of the inhabitants had time to avoid it by flight.\r\nThis shock extended throughout all Syria, and as far as the Cyclade\r\nislands, and into Euboea, where the fountains of Arethusa suddenly\r\nstopped, and did not reappear for many days after, and then by many\r\nnew springs remote from the old ones; that this earthquake did not\r\ncease from shaking the island, sometimes in one part and sometimes\r\nin another, until the earth opened in the valley of Lepanta, and\r\nejected a great quantity of lava and other inflamed matters. Pliny,\r\nin his first book, chap. 84, relates, that in the reign of Tiberius an\r\nearthquake happened which overthrew twelve towns in Asia: and in his\r\nsecond book he mentions a prodigy caused by an earthquake. St. Augustin\r\nrecords, that by a great earthquake there were towns overthrown in\r\nLybia. In the time of Trajan, the town of Antioch, and a great part of\r\nthe adjacent country were swallowed up by an earthquake; and in the\r\ntime of Justinian, in 528, it was a second time destroyed by the same\r\ncause, with upwards of 40,000 of its inhabitants. Sixty years after,\r\nin the time of St. Gregory, it felt the effects of a third earthquake,\r\nwhen 60,000 of its inhabitants perished. In the time of Saladin, in\r\n1182, most of the towns of Syria and Judea were destroyed by the same\r\ncalamity. In Calabria and Apulia, there have been more earthquakes\r\nthan in any other part of Europe. In the time of Pope Pius II. all the\r\nchurches and palaces of Naples were overthrown, and above 30,000 of\r\nits inhabitants killed; the remainder were obliged to live in tents\r\ntill houses were built. In 1629, there were earthquakes in Apulia,\r\nwhich destroyed 7000 persons, and in 1638, the town of St. Euphemia\r\nwas swallowed up, and there remains only a stinking lake in its place.\r\nRagusa and Smyrna, at the same time, were also almost destroyed. There\r\nwas an earthquake in 1692, which extended into England, Holland,\r\nFlanders, Germany, and France; it was chiefly felt on the sea coasts\r\nand near large rivers; it shook at least 2600 square leagues; it lasted\r\nonly two minutes, and the motion was more considerable on mountains\r\nthan in vallies.[O] On the 10th of July, 1688, there was an earthquake\r\nat Smyrna, which began by a motion from west to east; the castle was\r\nat first overthrown, its four walls being divided and sunk six feet in\r\nthe sea; this castle stood upon an isthmus, but is at present a real\r\nisland, about 100 paces distant from the land. The walls from east to\r\nwest are fallen down, those from north to south are yet standing; the\r\ncity, which is ten miles from the castle, was destroyed shortly after;\r\nin many places the earth opened, and subterraneous noises were heard;\r\nfive or six shocks were felt as night came on, the last continued\r\nonly half a minute; the ships in the roads were shaken; the ground of\r\nthe town was lowered about two feet; not above a quarter of the town\r\nwithstood the shock, and those principally the houses which stood on\r\nrocks; from 15 to 20,000 persons are computed to have been buried under\r\nthe ruins.[P] In 1695, an earthquake was felt at Bologna, in Italy, and\r\nit was remarked as a particular circumstance, that the water was much\r\ntroubled a day before.[Q][R]\r\n\r\n[O] See Ray's Discourses, page 272.\r\n\r\n[P] See the Hist. of the Acad. des Sciences, anno 1688.\r\n\r\n[Q] Ibid. anno 1696.\r\n\r\n[R] See the Voyages of Mandelso.\r\n\r\nAt Tercera there happened an earthquake on the 4th of May, 1614, which\r\noverthrew in the town of Angra eleven churches and nine chapels,\r\nbesides private houses; and in the town of Praya it was so terrible,\r\nthat scarcely an house was left standing. On the 16th of June 1628,\r\nthere was an earthquake in the island of St. Michael, the effects of\r\nwhich was so great, that in a place where the sea was more than 150\r\nfathoms deep an island was thrown up more than a league and a half\r\nlong, and upwards of 60 fathoms high. Another happened in 1691, in the\r\nisland of St. Michael, which began the 6th of July, and lasted till the\r\n12th of the following month: Tercera and Fayal were agitated the next\r\nmorning with so much violence, that they appeared to move; but these\r\nfrightful shocks returned there only four times, whereas at St. Michael\r\nthey did not cease a moment for several days. The islanders quitted\r\ntheir houses, which they saw fall before their eyes, and remained all\r\nthe time in the fields exposed to the injuries of the weather. The\r\nwhole town of Villa Franca was overthrown to its very foundation, and\r\nmost of the inhabitants buried under its ruins. In many parts the\r\nplains rose into hills, and in others, mountains were flattened into\r\nvallies. A spring of water issued from the earth, which flowed for four\r\ndays, and then ceased all on a sudden. The air and sea, still more\r\nagitated, resounded with a noise which might have been taken for the\r\nroaring of a number of wild animals. Many persons died with the fright;\r\nthe ships in the harbour suffered dangerous shocks, and those which\r\nwere at anchor, or under sail at 20 leagues distant from the islands,\r\nreceived great damage. Earthquakes are frequent in the Azores, and\r\nabout twenty years before a mountain in St. Michael was overturned by\r\none of them.[S]\r\n\r\n[S] Hist. of Voyages.\r\n\r\nIn Manilla, in the month of September, 1627, an earthquake levelled one\r\nof the two mountains called Carvallos, in the province of Cagayon; in\r\n1645, one third of the town was destroyed by a like accident, and 300\r\npersons perished. The succeeding year it experienced another; and the\r\nancient Indians say they were more terrible formerly, which was the\r\nreason they build their houses only of wood; a custom still continued,\r\nand which the Spaniards follow.[T]\r\n\r\n[T] See le Voyage de Gemelli Careri, page 120.\r\n\r\n\"The quantity of volcanos in this island confirms that assertion;\r\nbecause at certain times they vomit forth flames, shake the earth, and\r\nperform all the effects Pliny attributes to those of Vesuvius; that\r\nis, they change the beds of rivers, drive back the adjacent sea, fill\r\nwith cinders the neighbouring plains, and throw out stones to great\r\ndistances, with reports louder than those of cannons.\r\n\r\n\"In 1646, a mountain in the island of Machian split by an earthquake,\r\nwith a dreadful noise; from this opening issued a number of flames,\r\nwhich destroyed several plantations with the inhabitants and all that\r\nwas therein. In the year 1685, this prodigious crack was to be seen,\r\nand probably is still apparent; it is called the path of Machian,\r\nbecause it descends from the top to the bottom, like a road hollowed\r\nout, but which at a distance appears like a path.\"[U]\r\n\r\n[U] See the Hist. of the Conquest of the Malaccas, vol. ii. p. 318.\r\n\r\nThe history of the French Academy mentions in the following terms, the\r\nearthquakes that took place in 1702 and 1703. \"The earthquakes began in\r\nItaly in October 1702, and continued, till July 1703; the country which\r\nsuffered the most by them, and where they began, is the town of Norcia,\r\nwith its dependencies under the ecclesiastical government, and the\r\nprovince of Abruzzo, which are situated at the foot of the Apennines on\r\nthe south side.\r\n\r\n\"They were often accompanied with terrible noises in the air, which\r\nalso were heard without any dreadful effects, when the sky was serene.\r\nThe earthquake which happened on the 2d of February 1703, was the most\r\nviolent; it was accompanied, at least at Rome, with a great serenity\r\nof sky and calmness in the air. It lasted at Rome half a minute, and\r\nat Aquila the capital of Abruzzo three hours. It destroyed the whole\r\ntown of Aquila, buried 5000 persons under the ruins, and made great\r\nhavock in the environs. The vibration of the earth, according to the\r\nobservations made by the lamps in the churches, was from south to north.\r\n\r\n\"It opened two places from whence issued a great quantity of stones,\r\nwhich entirely covered it and rendered it barren; after the stones they\r\nthrew out water above the height of the trees; this lasted half an\r\nhour, and inundated the adjacent fields. The water was whitish, like\r\nsoap suds, and had not any remarkable taste.\r\n\r\n\"A mountain near Sigillo, a city twenty-two miles distant from Aquila,\r\nhad on its summit a very large plain surrounded with rocks like a wall.\r\nThe earthquake of the 2d of February, changed this plain into a gulph\r\nof unequal breadth, whose greatest diameter is twenty-five fathoms and\r\nthe least twenty; the depth of it has not been discovered, although a\r\nline 300 fathoms has been let down in it. At the time this opening was\r\nmade, flames were seen to issue out, and afterwards a great smoke which\r\nlasted three days with some interruptions.\r\n\r\n\"At Genoa on the 1st and 2d of July 1703, there were two slight\r\nearthquakes, the last was felt only by the people on the pier: at the\r\nsame time the sea in the port sunk six feet, and remained so a quarter\r\nof an hour.\r\n\r\n\"The sulphurous water in the road from Rome to Tivoli it diminished two\r\nfeet and a half, both in the bason and in the canal. In many places\r\nof the plain, called Testine, the springs and rivulets, which formed\r\nmorasses, are all dried up. The waters of the lake called l'Enfer is\r\nalso lowered three feet. In place of the ancient springs new ones have\r\nappeared at above a league distance, so that possibly they are the same\r\nwaters which have changed direction[V].\r\n\r\n[V] Anno 1704, page 10.\r\n\r\n\"The same earthquake which, in 1538, formed Monti di Cinere, near\r\nPozzoli, filled lake Lucrin with stones, earth and cinders, so that\r\nthis lake is now a marshy ground.[W]\r\n\r\n[W] See Ray's Discourses, page 12.\r\n\r\n\"There are earthquakes also felt at some distance at sea, says Mr.\r\nShaw; in 1774, being on board the Gazella, an Algerine vessel, mounting\r\n50 guns, three violent shocks were felt one after the other, as if\r\nevery time a weight of 20 or 30 tons had been thrown on the ballast.\r\nThis happened on a part of the Mediterranean that was more than 200\r\nfathom deep. He relates also, that others had felt earthquakes much\r\nmore considerable in other parts, and one among the rest at 40 leagues\r\nwest from Lisbon.\"[X]\r\n\r\n[X] See Shaw's Travels.\r\n\r\nSchouten, speaking of an earthquake in the Malacca islands, says,\r\nthat the mountains were shaken, and the vessels at anchor in 30 or 40\r\nfathoms water were shook, as if they had struck against rocks or banks.\r\n\"Experience, continues he, teaches us every day that the same happens\r\nin the open sea, where no bottom is to be met with, and that ships are\r\ntossed to and fro by earthquakes, even where the sea is tranquil.\"\r\n\r\nGentil, in his voyage round the world, speaks of earthquakes in\r\nthe following terms: \"I have, says he, made some remarks on these\r\nearthquakes; first, that half an hour before the earth is agitated\r\nevery animal is struck with fear; horses snort, break their fastenings,\r\nand fly from the stable; dogs bark; birds, as if stupified, fly into\r\nhouses for safety; and rats and mice quit their holes. Secondly, that\r\nvessels at anchor are so violently agitated, that every part of them\r\nseems as if going to pieces, the cannons force themselves loose, and\r\nthe masts break in several places. These facts I should scarcely have\r\ngiven credit to if many unanimous testimonies had not convinced me.\r\nI know the bottom of the sea is a continuation of the land, and that\r\nif one is agitated it will communicate to the other; but I could not\r\nconceive how every part of a vessel, floating in a fluid, should be\r\naffected in the same manner as if she was on the earth: it appeared to\r\nme that her motion should have been such as she experiences in a storm;\r\nbesides, in the circumstance which I speak of, the surface of the sea\r\nwas smooth, and there was no wind. Thirdly, that if the cavern of the\r\nearth, where this subterraneous fire is contained, has a direction\r\nfrom north to south, and if the buildings of an adjacent town are in a\r\nparallel line with it, all the houses are overthrown, whereas if this\r\nvein or cavern executes its effects by the breadth of the town, the\r\ndevastation of the earthquake, is much less considerable.\"[Y]\r\n\r\n[Y] See Gentil's Voyages, vol. I. page 172, &c.\r\n\r\nIn countries subject to earthquakes, when a new volcano breaks out\r\nearthquakes cease, and are only felt in the violent eruptions of the\r\nvolcano, as is observed in the island of St. Christopher.[Z]\r\n\r\n[Z] See Abridgement of Phil. Trans. vol. XI. page 302.\r\n\r\nThe enormous ravages produced by earthquakes have made some naturalists\r\nthink that mountains and other inequalities of the surface of the\r\nglobe were only the effects of subterraneous fires, and that all the\r\nirregularities must be attributed to the violent shocks which they have\r\nproduced. This, for example, is the opinion of Mr. Ray; he imagines\r\nthat all mountains have been formed by earthquakes, or the explosion\r\nof volcanos, as Monti di Cinere, the new island near Santorini, &c.\r\nbut he has not considered that the slight elevations formed by the\r\neruption of a volcano, or by the action of an earthquake, are not\r\ninternally composed of horizontal strata, as all other mountains are;\r\nfor by digging in the Monti di Cinere we meet with calcined stones,\r\ncinders, burnt earths, metallic dross, pumice-stones, &c. all mixed\r\nand confounded like a heap. Besides, if earthquakes and subterraneous\r\nfires had produced the great mountains of the earth, as the Cordeliers,\r\nMount Taurus, the Alps, &c. the prodigious force necessary to raise\r\nthese enormous masses might, at the same time, have destroyed a great\r\npart of the surface of the globe; and earthquakes, requisite to produce\r\nsuch effects, must have been of inconceivable violence, since the most\r\nfamous of which history makes mention have not had sufficient power to\r\nform a single mountain; for example, in the time of Valentian I. an\r\nearthquake happened, which was felt throughout all the known world;[AA]\r\nand yet not a mountain was thrown up by it.\r\n\r\n[AA] As Ammianus Marcellinus relates, lib. 26. cap. 14.\r\n\r\nIt is nevertheless certain, that although we might be able to find an\r\nearthquake sufficiently powerful to throw up the highest mountains, it\r\nwould not be sufficient to disorder the rest of the globe.\r\n\r\nFor supposing that the chain of the highest mountains which cross\r\nSouth America from the Magellanic lands to New Grenada, and the Gulph\r\nof Darien, had been produced by an earthquake, and then let us see by\r\ncalculations the effect of this explosion. This chain of mountains is\r\nnear 1700 leagues in length, and commonly 40 in breadth, comprehending\r\nthe Sieras, which are not so lofty as the Andes. The surface therefore\r\nis 68,000 square leagues; I suppose the thickness of the matter\r\ndisplaced by the earthquake to be about one league, that is, the\r\nheight of these mountains taken from the top to the caverns, which\r\naccording to this hypothesis must support them, is one league, then I\r\nsay, the power of an explosion must have raised a quantity of earth\r\nequal to 68,000 cubical leagues to a league in height. Now the action\r\nbeing equal to the re-action, this explosion must have communicated\r\nthe same motion to the rest of the globe. The whole globe consists of\r\n12,310,523,801 cubical leagues, from which subtracting 68,000, there\r\nremains 12,310,455,801 cubical leagues, the quantity of which motion\r\nwill be equal to that of 68,000 cubical leagues raised one league; from\r\nwhence we perceive that the force which will have been great enough to\r\nelevate 68,000 cubical leagues would not have displaced the whole globe\r\na single inch.\r\n\r\nThere would therefore be no absolute impossibility in the supposition\r\nthat mountains have been raised by earthquakes, if their internal\r\ncomposition as well as their external form were not evident proofs of\r\ntheir being the work of the sea. Their internal parts are composed\r\nof regular and parallel strata, intermingled with shells, and\r\ntheir external consists of a figure whose angles are every where\r\ncorrespondent: is it credible then that this uniform composition and\r\nregular form should have been produced by irregular shocks and sudden\r\nexplosions?\r\n\r\nBut as this opinion has prevailed among some philosophers, and as the\r\nnature and effects of earthquakes are not well understood, it may\r\npossibly be pertinent to hazard a few ideas with a view of explaining\r\nthose intricate subjects.\r\n\r\nThe earth has undergone great changes on its surface; we find at\r\nconsiderable depths, holes, caverns, subterraneous rivulets, and\r\nvoid places, which sometimes communicate by chinks, &c. There are\r\ntwo kinds of caverns; the first are those produced by the action of\r\nsubterraneous fires and volcanos; the action of this fire uplifts,\r\nburns, and throws out to a distance the matters that are above, and\r\nat the same time divides and deranges those which are on the sides,\r\nand thus produces caverns, grottos, and irregular holes, but which\r\nhowever is only effected in the environs of volcanos; and these kinds\r\nof caverns are more rare than those produced by water. We have already\r\nobserved that the different strata which compose the terrestrial globe\r\nare all interrupted by perpendicular fissures: the waters which fall\r\non the surface descend through them; collect when stopped by clay,\r\nand form springs and rivulets; by their natural propensities they seek\r\nout cavities or small vacancies, and always incline to open a passage\r\ntill they find a vent, carrying along with them sand, gravel, and other\r\nmatters they can divide and dissolve; by degrees, in the internal part\r\nof the earth they form small trenches; and at last issue forth in the\r\nform of springs, either at the surface of the earth, or bottom of the\r\nsea; the matters which they carry along with them, leave caverns whose\r\nextent may be very considerable, the origin of which is quite different\r\nfrom those produced by volcanos or earthquakes.\r\n\r\nThere are two kinds of earthquakes, the one caused by the action of\r\nsubterraneous fires, and the explosion of volcanos which are only\r\nfelt at small distances at the time of eruptions: when the matters\r\nwhich form subterraneous fires ferment, heat, and inflame, the fire\r\nmakes an effort on every side to get out, and if it does not find a\r\nnatural vent, it raises the earth above and forces itself a passage by\r\nthrowing it out; such is the beginning of a volcano whose effects and\r\ncontinuation are in proportion to the quantity of inflammable matters\r\nthey contain. If the quantity of matters is not considerable, an\r\nearthquake may ensue, without a volcano being formed. The air rarefied\r\nby the subterraneous fire may also escape through small vents, and in\r\nthis case there will be only a shock without any eruption or volcano.\r\nBut when the inflamed matter is in great quantities and confined by\r\nsolid and compressed bodies, then a commotion and volcano is certain\r\nto ensue; but all these commotions form only the first kind of\r\nearthquakes, and can only shake a small space of ground. A violent\r\neruption of Ætna will cause, for example, an earthquake throughout\r\nthe whole island of Sicily; but it will never extend to the distance\r\nof three or four hundred leagues. When any new mouth bursts out in\r\nVesuvius, there are earthquakes at Naples, and in the neighbourhood of\r\nthe volcano; but these earthquakes never shake the Alps, nor extend\r\ninto France, or other countries remote from Vesuvius. Therefore\r\nearthquakes produced by volcanos, are limited to a small space, are\r\nproperly but the effects of the re-action of the fire; and they shake\r\nthe earth, as the explosion of a powder magazine produces a shock\r\nperceptible at many leagues distance.\r\n\r\nBut there is another kind of earthquake very different in its effects,\r\nand perhaps equally so in its cause; such are felt at great distances,\r\nand shake a long course of ground, without any new volcano, or eruption\r\nin the old ones appearing. We have instances of earthquakes being felt\r\nat the same time in England, France, Germany, and even in Hungary;\r\nthese earthquakes always extend more in length than breadth; they shake\r\na zone of ground with greater or less violence in different places,\r\nand are almost always accompanied with a rumbling noise like that of a\r\ncoach rolling over the stones with rapidity.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the causes of this kind of earthquake, it must be\r\nremembered that the explosion of all inflammable matters produces, like\r\ngunpowder, a great quantity of air; that this air by the heat is in a\r\nstate of very great rarefaction, and that by its state of compression\r\nin the bowels of the earth, it must produce very violent effects. Let\r\nus suppose, that at a depth of one or two hundred fathoms, pyrites\r\nand other sulphurous matters are collected in great quantities, and\r\nthat by the fermentation produced by the filtration of the water, or\r\nother causes, they inflame; what must happen? First these matters\r\nare not placed in horizontal layers, as are the ancient strata, which\r\nhave been formed by the sediment of the waters; on the contrary, they\r\nare formed in perpendicular fissures, in caverns, and in other places\r\nwhere the water can penetrate. Inflaming, they produce a quantity of\r\nair, the spring of which being compressed in a small space, like that\r\nof a cavern, will not only shake the ground directly above, but will\r\nseek out for passages by which it may escape. The roads which offer\r\nthemselves are caverns and trenches, formed by subterraneous rivulets:\r\ninto these the rarefied air will precipitate with violence, form in\r\nthem a strong wind, the noise of which will be heard at the surface,\r\naccompanied with shocks of the earth, &c. this subterraneous wind,\r\nproduced by the fire, will extend as far as the subterraneous cavities,\r\nand cause an agitation more or less violent as it is distant from\r\nthe vent, and finds the passages of a larger or lesser extent: this\r\nmotion being made longitudinal, the shock will be the same, and the\r\nearthquake be felt through a long zone of ground. This air will not\r\nproduce any eruption, or volcano, because it will find sufficient space\r\nto expand, or rather because it will have found vents, and issue forth\r\nin form of wind and vapour. Even should it not be allowed that there\r\nexist internal passages, by which the air and vapours can pass, it\r\nmay be conceived that in the place where the first explosion is made,\r\nthe ground being lifted up to a considerable height, that the most\r\nadjoining to this spot must divide and split in an horizontal manner by\r\nthe force of its motion; and by this means passages communicating one\r\nwith the other may be opened to great distances; and this explanation\r\nagrees with every phenomena. It is not at the same moment or hour that\r\nan earthquake is felt in two distant places. Neither fire nor eruption\r\nattend those earthquakes which are heard at a distance, and the noise\r\nalways marks the progressive motion of this subterraneous wind. This\r\ntheory is confirmed by two other facts; it is well known that mines\r\nexhale unhealthy air and suffocating vapours, independent of the wind\r\nproduced by the current of water: it is also known that there are\r\nholes, abysses and deep lakes in the earth, which produce winds, as the\r\nlake Boleslaw, in Bohemia, which we have already spoken of.\r\n\r\nAll this being considered, I do not see how it can be imagined that\r\nearthquakes produce mountains, since the cause itself of these\r\nearthquakes are mineral and sulphurous matters, which are generally\r\nfound only in perpendicular clefts of mountains and other cavities\r\nof the earth; the greatest number of which have been produced by the\r\noperation of water; since this matter by inflaming produces only a\r\nmomentary explosion and a violent wind which follows the subterraneous\r\nroads of the water: since the duration of the earthquakes at the\r\nsurface of the earth is so short that their cause can only be explosion\r\nand not a durable fire: and in short, since these earthquakes, which\r\nextend to a considerable distance, very far from raising chains of\r\nmountains, do not produce the smallest hills throughout their whole\r\nextent.\r\n\r\nEarthquakes are, in fact, most frequent in places near volcanos, as\r\nin Sicily and Naples, but it is known, by observations, that the most\r\nviolent earthquakes happen in the time of the greatest eruptions of\r\nvolcanos; that they are very limited, and cannot produce a chain of\r\nmountains.\r\n\r\nIt has been sometimes observed, that the matters thrown out of Mount\r\nÆtna, after laying for many years and afterwards moistened with\r\nthe rain, have rekindled and thrown out flames with such violent\r\nexplosions as even to produce a slight shock.\r\n\r\nIn a furious eruption of Ætna in 1669, which began the 11th of March,\r\nthe summit of the mountains sunk considerably;[AB] which proves the\r\nfire of this volcano comes rather from the top than from the bottom of\r\nthe mountain. Borelli is of the same opinion, and says, \"That the fire\r\nof volcanos does not proceed from the centre, nor from the foot of the\r\nmountain, but that it issues from the summit, and flames kindle but at\r\na small depth.\"[AC]\r\n\r\n[AB] See Trans. Phil. Abridged, Vol. II. page 387.\r\n\r\n[AC] Borelli, De incendiis Montis Etnae.\r\n\r\nMount Vesuvius in its eruptions, has thrown out great quantities of\r\nboiling water. Mr. Ray, who thinks that the volcanean fire proceeds\r\nfrom a great depth, says, that it is the water of the sea which\r\ncommunicates by subterraneous passages with the foot of the mountain;\r\nhe gives, as a proof of it, the dryness of the summit of Vesuvius,\r\nand the agitation of the sea at the time of these eruptions, which\r\nsometimes retreats from the coasts, and leaves the Bay of Naples almost\r\ndry. But, if these facts are true, they do not prove, in a solid\r\nmanner, that the volcanean fire proceeds from a great depth; for the\r\nwater which is thrown out is certainly rain water, which penetrates\r\nthrough the fissure, and collects in the cavities of the mountains.\r\nRills and rivulets flow from those containing volcanos as well as other\r\nlofty mountains, and as they are hollow, and have been more shaken,\r\nit is not astonishing that the water collects in their caverns in\r\ntheir internal part, and that these waters are thrown out in the time\r\nof eruptions with other matters. With respect to the motion of the\r\nsea, it proceeds solely from the shock communicated to the waters by\r\nthe explosion, which causes them to advance or retreat according to\r\ndifferent circumstances.\r\n\r\nThe matters which volcanos generally throw out, come forth in the form\r\nof a torrent of melted minerals, which inundates all the environs\r\nof those mountains; these rivers of liquified matters extend to\r\nconsiderable distances, and in cooling form horizontal or inclined\r\nstrata, which for position are like the strata formed by the sediment\r\nleft by the waters: but it is very easy to distinguish the one from the\r\nother. First, because strata of lava are not throughout of an equal\r\nthickness: secondly, because they contain only matters which have\r\nevidently been calcined, vitrified, or melted; and thirdly, because\r\nthey do not extend to any great distance. As there are a great number\r\nof volcanos at Peru, and as the foot of most of the mountains of the\r\nCordeliers is covered with matters thrown out by eruptions, it is not\r\nastonishing that marine shells are not met with there, as they must\r\nhave been calcined and destroyed by the fire; but I am persuaded, if\r\nwe dig in argilaceous earth, which, according to M. Bourguet, is the\r\ncommon earth of the valley of Quito, shells would be found there, as\r\nthey are in other places, at least where the ground is not covered,\r\nlike that at the foot of the mountains, with matters thrown out of a\r\nvolcano.\r\n\r\nIt has often been asked, why volcanos are all met with at the top of\r\nmountains? I think I have partly given a satisfactory answer to this\r\nquestion in the preceding article, but I have thought it necessary not\r\nto finish this without farther explaining what I have said on this\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\nThe peaks or points of mountains were formerly covered with sand and\r\nearth, which the rain gradually washes along with it into the vallies,\r\nand has left only the rocks and stone, which forms the nucleus of\r\nthe mountain. This being left bare will have been still worn by the\r\ninjuries of the air, the frost will have loosened the large and small\r\nparts, which of course have rolled to the bottom. The rocks, at the\r\nbase of the summit, being left bare, and no longer supported by the\r\nearth which surrounded them, will have given way a little, and by\r\ndividing one from the other formed small intervals. This separation\r\nof the lower rocks could not be made without communicating a greater\r\nmotion to the upper. By this means the nucleus of the mountain would\r\nbe divided into an infinity of perpendicular clefts, from the summit\r\nto the base of the lower rocks; the rain will have penetrated into all\r\nthese clefts, and loosened, in the inside of the mountain, all the\r\nmineral parts and other matters that it could carry away or dissolve;\r\nthey will have formed pyrites and other combustible matters, and when\r\nby length of time these matters were accumulated in great quantities,\r\nthey fermented, and by inflaming produced explosions and other effects\r\nof volcanos; perhaps likewise, within the mountains, there were masses\r\nof these mineral matters already formed before the rain could penetrate\r\ntherein; in that case, as soon as holes and clefts were made, which\r\ngave passages to the water and air, these matters inflamed and formed a\r\nvolcano. None of these motions could be made in plains, since all is at\r\nrest and nothing can be displaced. It is not therefore surprising that\r\nvolcanos are found only in high mountains.\r\n\r\nWhen coal-mines are opened, which are generally met with in argile\r\nearth, at a great depth, it sometimes happens that the mineral\r\nsubstances have taken fire: there are even mines of coal in Scotland,\r\nFlanders, &c. which have burnt for a number of years. The admission of\r\nthe air suffices to produce this effect; but these fires produce only\r\nslight explosions, and do not form volcanos, because all being solid\r\nand full in these places, fire cannot be excited like that of volcanos,\r\nin which there are cavities and void places where the air penetrates,\r\nwhich must necessarily extend the conflagration and augment the action\r\nof the fire, so as to produce the terrible effects we have just\r\ndescribed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARTICLE XVII.\r\n\r\nOF NEW ISLANDS, CAVERNS, PERPENDICULAR CLEFTS, &C. &C.\r\n\r\n\r\nNew islands are formed either suddenly by the action of subterraneous\r\nfires, or gently by the deposit of the sediment of waters. Ancient\r\nhistorians and modern travellers relate facts on this subject which\r\nput it beyond all kind of doubt. Seneca assures us, that in his time\r\nthe island Therasia appeared suddenly in the sea, to the astonishment\r\nof many mariners who beheld it. Pliny relates, that formerly thirteen\r\nislands in the Mediterranean sprung at the same instant out of the\r\nsea, and that Rhodes and Delos are the principal of them: it appears,\r\nfrom him, as well as Ammianus Marcellinus, Philo, and others, that\r\nthese thirteen islands were not produced by an earthquake, nor by\r\nany subterraneous explosion, but that they were formerly hid under\r\nthe water, which lowering left them uncovered. Delos had the name of\r\nPelagia given to it, from having formerly belonged to the sea. Whether\r\nthe origin of these thirteen islands is to be attributed to the action\r\nof subterraneous fires, or to some other cause which might occasion\r\na sinking of the water in the Mediterranean, is uncertain. But Pliny\r\nrelates, that the island Hiera, near Therasia, had been formed of\r\nferruginous masses, and earth thrown from the bottom of the sea; and in\r\nchapter 89, he speaks of other islands formed in the like manner; but\r\non this subject we have more clear and certain facts of later date.\r\n\r\nOn the 23d of May 1707, at the sun's rising, there was seen, at some\r\nlittle distance from the island of Therasia, or Santorini, something\r\nlike a floating rock in the sea; some persons, to satisfy their\r\ncuriosity, went towards it, and found it a shoal which had issued\r\nfrom the bottom of the sea; it increased under their feet, and they\r\nbrought with them the pumice-stone and oysters, which the rock still\r\nhad attached to its surface. There was a slight earthquake at Santorini\r\ntwo days before this shoal appeared: it increased considerably till\r\nthe 14th of June, it was then half a mile round, and from 20 to 30 feet\r\nhigh; the earth was white, and a little argilaceous; after that the sea\r\nbecame more and more troubled; vapours arose which infected the island\r\nSantorini; and on the 16th of July several rocks were seen to issue at\r\none time from the bottom of the sea, and unite into one solid body.\r\nThis was accompanied with a dismal noise, which continued upwards of\r\ntwo months. Flames issued from the new island, which kept increasing in\r\ncircumference and height, and the violent explosions frequently threw\r\nlarge stones to more than seven miles distance. The island Santorini\r\nitself was deemed among the ancients as a modern production, and in\r\n726, 1427, and 1573, it increased in size, and small islands were\r\nformed near it.[AD] The same volcano, which in the time of Seneca\r\nformed the island of Santorini, in that of Pliny produced Hiera or\r\nVolcanella, and in our time the shoal above-mentioned.\r\n\r\n[AD] See the Hist. of the Acad. 1708, page 23, &c.\r\n\r\nOn the 10th of October 1720, near the island Tercera, a very\r\nconsiderable fire arose out of the sea; some mariners were sent by the\r\norder of the governor to take a view of it, and who having come near\r\nit, perceived, on the 19th of the same month, an island which appeared\r\nonly as fire and smoke, with a prodigious quantity of ashes thrown to\r\na distance, as if caused by the force of a volcano, with a report like\r\nthat of thunder. An earthquake happened at the same time, which was\r\nfelt in the circumjacent places, and great quantities of pumice-stones\r\nwere observed floating on the sea around the new island; pumice-stones\r\nindeed have sometimes been seen swimming in the midst of the high\r\nseas.[AE]\r\n\r\n[AE] See Phil. Trans. Abridg. vol. VI. part ii. page 254.\r\n\r\nThe historian of the academy, anno 1721, says on this event, that after\r\nan earthquake in the island of St. Michael, one of the Azores, there\r\nappeared between this island and Tercera a torrent of fire, which gave\r\nbirth to two new shoals; and the next year he gave the following detail:\r\n\r\n\"M. de l'Isle has informed the academy of many particulars concerning\r\nthe new island among the Azores, which he received in a letter from M.\r\nde Montagnac, consul at Lisbon.\r\n\r\n\"Being in a vessel, which was moored the 18th of September 1721, before\r\nthe fortress of the town of St. Michael, M. de Montagnac learnt the\r\nfollowing account from the pilot:\r\n\r\n\"On the 7th of December 1720, at night, there was a great earthquake in\r\nTercera and St. Michael, which are about 18 leagues apart, and between\r\nwhich a new island sprung up: it was remarked at the same time, that\r\nthe point of the island of Peak, 30 leagues distant, and which before\r\nthrew out fire, was sunk and emitted none; but the new island kept\r\nthrowing out a constant thick smoke, and which I plainly perceived\r\nfrom the vessel I was in. The pilot assured us that he had gone round\r\nthe island, rowing as near it as he conceived to be safe. On the south\r\nside he threw a line of sixty fathoms without finding any bottom; on\r\nthe west side the water was greatly changed, appearing white, blue\r\nand green, and which extended two thirds of a league, where it seemed\r\nready to boil. On the north-west, the part from which the smoke issued,\r\nhe found, at 15 fathoms, a bottom of thick sand; he threw a stone in\r\nthe sea, and where it fell the water seemed to boil and bubble with\r\nimpetuosity; the bottom was so hot that it twice melted some grease\r\nfastened at the end of the sounding line. The pilot observed also on\r\nthat side that smoke issued from a small lake bounded by a sand bank.\r\nThis island is almost round and high enough to be perceived at the\r\ndistance of seven or eight leagues in clear weather.\r\n\r\n\"It has since been learnt from a letter of M. Adrian, French consul in\r\nthe island of St. Michael, dated March 1722, that the new island had\r\nconsiderably diminished, that it was almost level with the water, and\r\nthere was every appearance it would not last long.\"\r\n\r\nIt is therefore by these, and a great number of other facts of a\r\nsimilar nature, very evident that inflammable matters are enclosed in\r\nthe earth under the bottom of the sea, and that they sometimes cause\r\nviolent explosions. The places where this happens might be termed\r\nmarine volcanos, and which differ from common volcanos only by the\r\nshortness of the duration of their effects; for the fire having opened\r\nitself a passage, the water must penetrate therein and extinguish it.\r\nThe elevation of new islands must consequently leave a void space which\r\nthe water would shortly occupy, and this new earth, which is only\r\ncomposed of matters thrown out by the marine volcano, must resemble\r\nthat of Monti di Cinere and other eminencies which terrestrial volcanos\r\nhave formed. Now as the water rushes in, during the violence of the\r\nexplosion, and fills the vacancies that it occasions, that is clearly\r\nthe reason why these marine volcanos act less frequently than other\r\nvolcanos, although the causes of both are the same.\r\n\r\nThese subterraneous, or sub-marine fires are doubtless the cause of all\r\nthose ebullitions of the sea, which sailors have remarked in various\r\nplaces, and as well as of the water-spouts we have before mentioned;\r\nthey likewise produce storms and earthquakes, which are not less\r\nfelt on the sea than on the land. Islands formed by these sub-marine\r\nvolcanos, are generally composed of pumice-stone, and calcined rocks,\r\nand produce, like those of the land, violent earthquakes and commotions.\r\n\r\nFires have been often observed on the surface of the water. Pliny tells\r\nus that the lake Thrasimenia appeared inflamed over all its surface.\r\nAgricola relates that when a stone was thrown into the lake Denstat, in\r\nThuringia, it appeared, as it descended in the water, like a train of\r\nfire.\r\n\r\nIn short, the quantities of pumice-stones which travellers affirm are\r\nmet with in many parts of the ocean, and the Mediterranean, prove\r\nthere are volcanos at the bottom of the sea, similar to those we are\r\nacquainted with, and which differ not in the least from them, neither\r\nby the matters they cast out, nor by the violence of the explosion, but\r\nsolely by the rarity and shortness of the duration of their effects.\r\nFrom hence we may fairly infer that the bottom of the sea in every\r\nrespect resembles the surface of the earth.\r\n\r\nWe shall find many connections between land and sea volcanos; both are\r\nfound at the summit of mountains. The islands of Azores and those of\r\nthe Archipelago are only peaks of mountains, some of which rise above\r\nthe water, and others are underneath. By the account of the new islands\r\namong the Azores we see that the part from whence the smoke issued was\r\nonly 15 fathoms under water, which, compared with the common depth of\r\nthe ocean, proves that even this part is the summit of a mountain; as\r\nmuch may be said of the new island near Santorini, which could not be\r\nany great depth, since oysters were found attached to the rocks which\r\nrose above the water. It appears also that marine-volcanos have, like\r\nthose of the land, subterraneous communications, since the summit of\r\nthe volcano of St. George, in the island Peak, sunk at the time the new\r\nisland among the Azores arose. It must also be observed, that these new\r\nislands never appear but near the old ones, and that we have no example\r\nof new islands in the high seas; we must therefore look on them as a\r\ncontinuation of the adjacent islands; and when ancient islands have\r\nvolcanos, it is not astonishing that the ground adjacent should contain\r\nmatters proper to form them, and which inflame, either by fermentation\r\nalone, or by the action of subterraneous winds.\r\n\r\nIslands produced by the action of fire and earthquakes are but few,\r\nbut there are an infinite number produced by the mud, sand, and earth,\r\nwhich the rivers or the sea transport into different places. At the\r\nmouth of rivers earth and sand accumulate in such quantities as to form\r\nislands of a moderate extent. The sea, retiring from certain coasts,\r\nleaves the highest parts of the bottom naked, which forms so many new\r\nislands; so likewise the sea, by extending itself on certain shores,\r\ncovers the lowest parts, and leaves the highest, which appear as so\r\nmany islands; and thus it is we may account for there being so few\r\nislands in the open sea, and so many bordering on the continents.\r\n\r\nWater and fire, whose natures appear so different and so contrary,\r\nproduce many similar effects, independent of the particular productions\r\nof these two elements, some of which bear so striking a resemblance\r\nas to be mistaken for each other, as glass and crystal, natural and\r\nfictitious antimony, &c. There are in nature an infinity of great\r\neffects produced by them, which are scarcely to be distinguished.\r\nWater, as has been observed, has produced mountains and formed most\r\nislands, while others owe their origin to fire. There are likewise\r\ncaverns, clefts, holes, gulphs, &c. some of which owe their origin to\r\nsubterraneous fires, and others to waters.\r\n\r\nCaverns are met with in mountains, and few or none in plains: there\r\nare many in the Archipelago, and in other islands, because they are in\r\ngeneral only the tops of mountains: caverns are formed like precipices,\r\nby the sinking of rocks, or large abysses, by the action of the fire;\r\nfor to make a cavern form a precipice or abyss, we need only suppose\r\nthe tops of adjacent rocks had fallen together and formed an arch,\r\nwhich must often happen when their bottoms are shaken and dislodged by\r\ntime or earthquakes. Caverns may be produced by the same causes which\r\nproduce holes, the shaking and sinking of the earth, and which causes\r\nare the explosion of volcanos, the action of subterraneous vapours and\r\nearthquakes; for they occasion caverns, holes, and hollows of every\r\nkind by their shocks and commotion.\r\n\r\nSt. Patrick's cavern in Ireland is not so considerable as it is famous;\r\nit is the same with the Dog's Grotto in Italy; and that which throws\r\nout fire, in the mountain of Beniguazeval in the kingdom of Fez. In\r\nthe county of Derby, in England, there is a very considerable cavern,\r\nmuch larger than the famous cavern of Beauman, near the Black Forest,\r\nin Brunswick. I have been informed by a person as respectable for his\r\nmerit as his name, Lord Morton, that this large cavern, called the\r\nDevil's Hole, at first presents a very considerable opening, larger\r\nthan any church door; that through this opening a rivulet flows; that\r\nin advancing the vault of the cavern becomes so low, that persons\r\nwho are desirous of continuing their road are obliged to lie flat in\r\na boat and be pushed through this narrow passage, where the water\r\nalmost touches the roof; but after having passed this part of the\r\nvault, the arch rises to a considerable height, and continues so for\r\nsome distance, when it sinks again so low as to touch the water, and\r\nwhere the cavern ends. The source of the rivulet which issues from it\r\nsometimes encreases considerably: it transports and heaps up a great\r\nquantity of sand in one part of the cavern, which is formed like a\r\nkind of alley, whose direction is different from that of the principal\r\ncavern.\r\n\r\nIn Carniola, near Potpechio, is a very spacious cavern, in which is\r\na large lake. Near Adelsperg is a cavern, in which we may travel two\r\nGerman miles, and where very deep precipices are to be met with.[AF]\r\nThere are also large caverns and beautiful grottos under the mountains\r\nof Mendip, in Wales; mines of lead are found near these caverns, and\r\nwhole oaks at fifteen fathoms deep. In the county of Gloucester there\r\nis a very large cavern, called Pen Park-hole, at the bottom of which\r\nthere is thirty fathoms water, and mines of lead are also found.\r\n\r\n[AF] See Act. erud. Lips. anno. 1689, page 558.\r\n\r\nThe Devil's Hole, and other caverns, from whence issue large springs or\r\nrivulets, have plainly therefore been formed by the water, and their\r\norigin cannot be considered as the effects either of earthquakes or\r\nvolcanos.\r\n\r\nOne of the most remarkable and largest caverns known is that of\r\nAntiparos, a description of which is given by M. de Tournefort. We\r\nenter a rustic cavern about thirty feet broad, divided by some natural\r\npillars; between two of which, on the right, the ground is on a gentle\r\nslope, and then becomes more steep to the bottom, about twenty feet;\r\nthis is the passage to the grotto, or internal cavern, which is very\r\ndark, and cannot be entered without stooping and the assistance of\r\ntorches. We then descend an horrible precipice by the assistance of\r\na rope, fastened at the entrance, into another still more frightful,\r\nthe borders of which are very slippery, with dark abysses on the left.\r\nBy the assistance of a ladder we pass a perpendicular rock, and then\r\ncontinue to go through places somewhat less dangerous: but when we\r\nthink ourselves in a safe path, we are stopped short by a tremendous\r\nobstruction, and are obliged to crawl on our hands and knees, or slide\r\non our back, the length of a large rock, and then descend by a ladder.\r\nWhen we are at the bottom of the ladder, we still have to stumble over\r\npieces of rocks for some time, and then we reach the celebrated grotto.\r\nIt is computed to be three hundred fathoms deep from the surface of the\r\nearth, appears to be forty fathoms high by fifty broad. It is filled\r\nwith large beautiful stalactites of various forms, as well from the\r\nroof of the vault as on the bottom.[AG]\r\n\r\n[AG] See the Voyage de Levant, page 188, and also Remarks in a Journey\r\nfrom Paris to Constantinople, which contains a copious description of\r\nthis astonishing phenomenon.\r\n\r\nIn part of Greece called Livadia (the Achaia of the ancients) there\r\nis a large cavern in a mountain which was formerly famous for the\r\noracles of Trophonius; it is between the lake Livadia and the adjacent\r\nsea; at the nearest part it is about forty miles; and there are forty\r\nsubterraneous passages across the rock, through which the waters\r\nflow.[AH]\r\n\r\n[AH] See Gordon's Geography, 1733, page 179.\r\n\r\nIn all countries which produce sulphur, volcanos, and earthquakes,\r\nthere are caverns. The ground of most of the Archipelago islands is\r\ncavernous; the islands of the Indian ocean, principally that of the\r\nMalacca's, appear to be supported by vaults and cavities. The land\r\nAzores, the Canaries, the islands of Cape de Verd, and in general\r\nalmost every small island, is in many parts hollow and cavernous;\r\nbecause these islands are, as we have observed, only points of\r\nmountains where considerable ebullitions are made, either by the action\r\nof volcanos, of the water, of frosts, or other injuries of the weather.\r\nIn the Cordeliers, where there are many volcanos, and where earthquakes\r\nare frequent, there are also a great number of caverns.\r\n\r\nThe famous labyrinth of the island of Candia, is not the work of nature\r\nalone; M. de Tournefort assures us that it has evidently been greatly\r\nenlarged by men; and most likely this cavern is not the only one which\r\nhas been augmented by human labour. Every day mines and quarries are\r\ndigging, and when abandoned for a long time, it is not easy to discover\r\nwhether they have been the productions of nature, or formed by the\r\nhands of men. We know of quarries of considerable extent; for example\r\nthat of Maestricht, where it is said 50,000 men may conceal themselves,\r\nand which is supported by upwards of 1000 pillars, twenty-four feet\r\nhigh, and the earth and rock above is more than twenty-five fathoms\r\nthick.[AI]\r\n\r\n[AI] See Abridg. Phil. Trans. vol. XI. page 461.\r\n\r\nThe salt mines in Poland form still greater excavations than the above.\r\nThere are generally vast quarries near large towns. But we cannot\r\nproceed farther in particulars; besides, the labour of man, however\r\ngreat, will ever hold but a small place in the history of nature.\r\n\r\nVolcanos and waters which produce caverns internally, form also\r\nexternal clefts, precipices, and abysses. At Cajeta, in Italy, there\r\nis a mountain which had formerly been separated by an earthquake, in\r\na manner so as to appear as if the division was made by the hands of\r\nmen. We have already spoken of the divisions in the island of Machian,\r\nof the abyss of mount Azarat, of the gap in the Cordeliers, and that\r\nof Thermopyle, &c. To these may be added, the gap in the mountain of\r\nTroglodytes, in Arabia, which nature only sketched out, and which\r\nVictor Amadeus caused to be finished. Water as well as subterraneous\r\nfires produce considerable sinking of the earth, fall of rocks, and\r\noverthrow mountains, of which we can give many examples.\r\n\r\n\"In the month of June 1714, a part of the mountain of Diableret, in\r\nValois, fell suddenly, and some time after, the sky being serene, it\r\nappeared to have taken a conical figure. Fifty-three huts belonging\r\nto the boors were destroyed, together with several people and a great\r\nmany cattle, covering a square league with the ruins it occasioned. A\r\nprofound darkness was caused by the dust; the heaps of stones thrown\r\ntogether were above thirty perches in height, stopped the currents of\r\nthe water, and formed new and very deep lakes. In all this there was\r\nnot the least trace of bitumen, sulphur, lime, nor consequently any\r\nsubterraneous fire, and apparently the base of this great rock was\r\nperished and reduced to dust.[AJ]\"\r\n\r\n[AJ] Histoire de l'Academie des Sciences, anno 1715, p. 4.\r\n\r\nWe have a remarkable example of these sinkings near Folkstone, in\r\nthe county of Kent; the hills in its environs sunk gradually by an\r\ninsensible motion, and without any earthquake. These hills internally\r\nare rocks and chalk, and by their sinking they have thrown into the sea\r\nrocks and earth which were adjacent to it. The relation of this fact\r\nmay be seen in the Abridgment of the Philosophical Transactions, vol.\r\nVI. page 250.\r\n\r\nIn 1618, the town of Pleurs, in Valtelino, was buried under the rocks,\r\nat the bottom of which it was situated. In 1678, there was a great\r\ninundation in Gascony, caused by the sinking of some pieces of one\r\nof the Pyrennees, which forced the water to spring forth that was\r\ncontained in the subterraneous caverns of those mountains. In 1680,\r\nthere happened a still greater in Ireland, by the sinking of a mountain\r\ninto caverns filled with water. We may easily conceive the cause of\r\nthese effects. It is well known there are subterraneous waters in an\r\ninfinity of places; these waters carry off by degrees the sand and\r\nearth over which they pass, consequently may in time destroy the bed\r\nof earth on which the mountain rests; and this bed of earth being more\r\ndeficient on one side than on the other, the mountain of course must be\r\noverthrown; but if this base is worn every where alike, the mountain\r\nwill sink and not be overthrown.\r\n\r\nHaving remarked on the sinkings and other changes on the earth,\r\noccasioned by what may be called the accidents of nature, we ought\r\nnot to pass over the perpendicular clefts found throughout the strata\r\nof the earth: these clefts are perceptible not only in rocks and\r\nquarries of marble and stone, but also in clays and earths of every\r\nkind, which have never been removed. I call them perpendicular clefts,\r\nbecause, like the horizontal strata, they are oblique, by accident\r\nonly. Woodward and Ray speak of these clefts, but in a confused manner;\r\nand they do not term them perpendicular clefts, because they thought\r\nthey might be indifferently oblique or perpendicular. No author has\r\nexplained the origin of them, although it is apparent that they have\r\nbeen produced, as we observed in a preceding article, by the dryness\r\nof the matters which compose horizontal beds. In whatsoever manner\r\nthis drying happens, it must have produced perpendicular clefts; for\r\nthe matters which compose the strata could not have diminished in\r\nsize without splitting in a perpendicular direction to these strata.\r\nI comprehend under this name of perpendicular clefts all natural\r\nseparations of rocks, as well as those which may have been occasioned\r\nby any convulsive accident. When some considerable motion happens to\r\nmasses of rocks, these clefts are sometimes found obliquely placed,\r\nbut this is because the mass is of itself oblique, and with a little\r\nattention it is always easy to discover that these clefts are in\r\ngeneral perpendicular to the horizontal strata, particularly in\r\nquarries of marble, lime, stones, and all large chains of rocks.\r\n\r\nMountains internally are principally composed of stone and rocks in\r\nparallel beds: between the horizontal beds small strata of a softer\r\nmatter than stone is found, and the perpendicular clefts are filled\r\nwith sand, crystals, minerals, metals, &c. these last matters are of\r\na more modern formation than the horizontal beds in which we find\r\nsea-shells. The rains have by degrees loosened the sand and the earth\r\non the upper parts of mountains, and have left the stone and rocks\r\nentirely naked, in which we readily distinguish the horizontal strata\r\nand perpendicular clefts: in plains, on the contrary, the rain-water\r\nand flood having brought a considerable quantity of earth, sand,\r\ngravel, and other such matters, have formed a bed of tufa, soft and\r\ndissoluble stone, sand, gravel, and earth, mixed with vegetables. These\r\nbeds contain no marine shells, or at least only fragments, which have\r\nbeen detached from mountains, with gravel and earth. We must carefully\r\ndistinguish these new beds from the old, where almost always a great\r\nnumber of entire shells are found placed in their natural situation.\r\n\r\nIf we observe the order and internal disposition of matters in a\r\nmountain, composed, for example, of common stones, or calcinable\r\nlapidific matters, we generally find a bed of gravel under the\r\nvegetable earth, of the nature and colour of the stone which\r\npredominates in this ground; and under the gravel we meet with stone.\r\nWhen the mountain is divided by some trench, or deep cut, we easily\r\ndistinguish all the strata of which it is composed. Each horizontal\r\nstratum is separated by a kind of joint, which is likewise horizontal,\r\nand their thickness generally increase in proportion as they lower\r\nfrom the summit of the mountain, and are all divided vertically by\r\nperpendicular clefts. In common, the first stratum which is met\r\nwith under the gravel, and even the second, are only thinner than\r\nthe beds which form the base of the mountain, but are so divided by\r\nperpendicular clefts, that pieces of any length are not to be seen:\r\nthey perfectly resemble the cracks of ground which is very dry, but go\r\nnot very far, gradually disappearing in proportion as they descend, and\r\ntowards the bottom there are no great number but where they divide\r\nthe strata in a more regular manner. These beds of stone are often\r\nmany leagues in extent, without any interruption; we almost always\r\nmeet with the same kind of stone in the opposite mountains, whether\r\ndivided by a small neck or a valley; and the beds of stone disappear\r\nonly in places where the mountain sinks and becomes level with some\r\nlarge plain. Sometimes, between the first stratum of vegetable earth\r\nand that of gravel, marl is found, which communicates its colour and\r\nother qualities to the other two: then the perpendicular clefts of the\r\nquarries which are beneath are filled with this marl, where it acquires\r\nan hardness in appearance equal to that of stone, but by exposing it to\r\nthe air it crumbles, softens and becomes ductile.\r\n\r\nIn most quarries the beds of stone formed on the summit of a mountain\r\nare soft, and those near the base are hard; the first is commonly\r\nwhite, of so fine a grain as scarcely to be perceived; it becomes more\r\ngrained and harder in proportion as it descends, and the lowest stone\r\nis not only harder than that of the upper, but it is also closer, more\r\ncompact and heavier its grain is fine and glossy, and often brittle,\r\nand breaks as clear as flint.\r\n\r\nThe interior part of a mountain is therefore composed of different beds\r\nof stone, the upper of which are of soft stone and the lower of hard,\r\nand much broader at the bottom than at the top; which indeed almost\r\nnecessarily follows, for, as they become so much the harder as they\r\ndescend, it may be fairly supposed that the currents and other motions\r\nof the water which have hollowed the vallies and given a shape to the\r\nturnings of a mountain, will have laterally worked on the matters of\r\nwhich the mountain is composed, and have worn them away in proportion\r\nas they were hard or soft. Now the upper strata being the softest, it\r\nwill naturally have suffered the greatest diminution. This is one of\r\nthe causes to which the inclination of mountains may be attributed, and\r\nthis inclination will be still less steep in proportion as the earth\r\nand gravel have been washed away by the rain; and for these reasons\r\nit is, that hills and mountains composed of calcinable matters, have\r\nan inclination much less than those composed of live rock and flint\r\nin large masses; the last in general are of considerable heights and\r\nnearly perpendicular, because, in these masses of vitrifiable matters,\r\nthe upper beds, as well as the lower, are of great hardness, and have\r\nalike resisted the action of the waters.\r\n\r\nWhen on the top of a hill, whose summit is flat, and of a pretty large\r\nextent, we meet with hard stone directly under the stratum of vegetable\r\nearth, we must remark, that what appears to be the summit, is not so in\r\nfact, but only the continuation of some higher hill, whose upper strata\r\nare soft stone and the lower hard; and it is the prolongation of these\r\nlast strata that we meet with again at the top of the first hill.\r\n\r\nOn the summit of mountains which are not surmounted by any considerable\r\nheight it is generally only soft stone, and we must dig very deep to\r\nmeet with hard. Banks of marble are never found but between these beds\r\nof hard stone, which are diversely coloured by the metallic earths\r\nwhich the rain introduces into the strata by filtration, and possibly\r\nin every country where there is stone, marble would be found if dug for\r\nto a sufficient depth; _Quoto enim loco non suum marmor invenitur?_\r\nsays Pliny. In fact it is a much more common stone than it is thought\r\nto be, and differs from other stones only by the fineness of its grain,\r\nwhich renders it more compact and susceptible of a brilliant polish;\r\nand from which quality it took its denomination from the ancients.\r\n\r\nThe perpendicular fissures and joints of quarries are often filled\r\nand incrusted with concretions, which are sometimes as transparent as\r\ncrystal, of a regular figure, sometimes opaque: the water flows through\r\nthe perpendicular clefts, and penetrates even the compact texture of\r\nthe stone; the stones which are porous, imbibe so great a quantity of\r\nwater, that the frost splits and divides them. The rain by filtrating\r\nthrough the beds of marle, stone, and marble, load themselves with\r\nevery matter they can take up or dissolve. These waters at first run\r\nalong the perpendicular clefts, afterwards penetrate the beds of\r\nstone, and deposit between the horizontal joints, as well as in the\r\nperpendicular clefts, the matters they have brought with them, and form\r\nthese different congelations according to the nature of the matters\r\nthey have deposited; for example, when the water filters through marle,\r\nchalk, or soft stone, the matters which they deposit are a very pure\r\nand fine marle, which generally enters in the perpendicular cleft\r\nof the rocks under the form of a porous, soft substance, commonly\r\nvery white and light, which naturalists have called _Lac lunac_, or\r\n_Medulla Saxi_.\r\n\r\nWhen these streams of water, loaded with lapidific matter, flow through\r\nthe horizontal joints of soft stone or chalk, this matter attaches\r\nitself to the surface of the blocks of stone, and forms white, scaly,\r\nlight, and spongy crust; which some authors have named _Mineral\r\nAgaric_, from its resemblance to Vegetable Agaric: but if the strata\r\nare of common hard stone, proper to make good lime, the filter being\r\nthen more close, the water will issue from it loaded with lapidific\r\nmatter, more pure and homogeneous, and whose molecules uniting more\r\nintimately, will form nearly concretions of the hardness of stone,\r\nwith a little transparency, and we shall find on the surfaces of the\r\nblocks in these quarries, stony incrustations variously disposed, which\r\nentirely fill up the horizontal joints.\r\n\r\nIn grottos and cavities of rocks, which may be looked upon as the\r\nbasons of perpendicular clefts, the diverted direction of the streams\r\nof water, give different forms to the concretion which result\r\ntherefrom. They in general have the appearance of a cone attached to\r\nthe top of the vault, although they may more properly be considered\r\nas hollow and white cylinders, formed by a concentrical surface; these\r\ncongelations sometimes descend, by drops, to the bottom, and form\r\npillars, and a thousand other figures, as uncouth and ridiculous as\r\nthe names which naturalists have been pleased to give them, such as,\r\n_Stalactites_, _Stelegmites_, _Osleocollae_, &c.\r\n\r\nWhen these concretic juices issue immediately from marble and hard\r\nstone, the lapidific matter conveyed by the water being rather\r\ndissolved than loosened, the small constituent parts take a regular\r\nfigure, and form columns, terminated by triangular points, which are\r\ntransparent and consist of oblique strata; this is called Spar, or\r\nSpall. It is generally transparent and colourless, but when the stone\r\nor marble, from whence it issues, contains metallic parts, this spar\r\nis as hard as stone; it dissolves, like stone, by acid spirits, and\r\ncalcines with the same heat; therefore we cannot doubt that it is real\r\nstone, and perfectly homogeneous. It might even be said that it is a\r\npure and elementary stone, under its proper and specific form.\r\n\r\nMost naturalists nevertheless look on this matter as a direct\r\nsubstance, existing independent of stone; it is the lapidific or\r\ncrystalline juice which, according to them, not only binds the parts\r\nof common stone, but even those of flint. This juice, say they,\r\nconstantly augments the density of stones by reiterated filtrations,\r\nand at length converts them into real flint. When this juice is fixed\r\nin spar, it continues to receive still more pure juices, which increase\r\nits density and hardness, so that this matter successively becomes\r\nglass, then crystal, and at last a perfect diamond.\r\n\r\nBut if this is true, why, in whole provinces, does this crystalline\r\njuice form only stone, and in others nothing but flint? Will they say,\r\nthat the two soils are not of a like age, and that this juice has not\r\nhad time to circulate and complete the end of its natural action? This\r\nis not probable. Besides, from whence does this juice proceed? If it\r\nproduces stone and flints, what is it that produces this juice? It is\r\napparent that it has no existence independent of these matters, which\r\nof themselves can give to the water that penetrates them a petrifying\r\nquality, always relative to their native and specific character;\r\ninsomuch that when it filtrates through stones it forms spar, and\r\nwhen it issues from flints, crystal: and there are as many different\r\nkinds of this juice, as matters from which they proceed. Experience\r\nperfectly agrees with this idea. The waters which filtrate through\r\nstone quarries, generally form soft and calcinable matters like the\r\nstones themselves; on the contrary, those which spring from rock and\r\nflint form hard and vitrifiable congelations, which have all the\r\nother properties of flint, as the first have all those of stone; so\r\nthe waters which have penetrated the beds of mineral and metallic\r\nsubstances produce pyrites, marcasites, and grains.\r\n\r\nWe have observed, that we might divide all matters into two great\r\nclasses, vitrifiable and calcinable; clay and flint, marle and stone,\r\nmay be looked upon as the two extremes of each of these classes, the\r\nintervals of which are filled with an almost infinite variety of the\r\nmixt matters that have always one or other of these substances for\r\ntheir basis.\r\n\r\nThe substances of the first class can never acquire the nature and\r\nproperties of the other. Stone will always be as remote from the nature\r\nof flint, as potters earth is from marle; no known agent will ever be\r\ncapable of making them quit the combinations peculiar to their nature:\r\nthe country which produces stone and marble will remain to do so as\r\ncertainly as those wherein there is only flint and granate will never\r\nhave either stone or marble.\r\n\r\nIf we observe the order and distribution of matters in a hill composed\r\nof vitrifiable matters, we shall commonly find, under the first bed\r\nof vegetable earth, a bed of clay, a vitrifiable matter, analogous to\r\nflint, and which, as I have observed, is only a decomposed vitrifiable\r\nsand: this bed of argilaceous earth or sand answers to a bed of gravel\r\nmet with in hills composed of calcinable matters: beneath which we meet\r\nwith some beds of free-stone scarcely ever more than six inches thick,\r\nand divided into small pieces by perpendicular clefts. Under these\r\nbeds are many others of the same matters, and also beds of vitrifiable\r\nsand, the free-stone becomes harder and its blocks encrease in size\r\nin proportion as we descend; underneath these we find a very hard\r\nmatter which I have called live rock, or flint in large masses, which\r\nis so hard as to resist the file, graver, and acid spirits, more than\r\nvitrifiable sand, and even powdered glass, on which aqua-fortis seems\r\nto have some effect. If struck by another hard body it emits sparks,\r\nand exhales a very penetrating smell of sulphur. This massy flint, as\r\nI have termed it, is generally found with beds of clay, earth, coals,\r\nand vitrifiable sand, answers to the strata of hard stone and marbles,\r\nwhich serve as a base to hills composed of calcinable matters.\r\n\r\nWater, by flowing through perpendicular clefts, and by penetrating\r\nthe strata of these vitrifiable sands, clays, and earths, becomes\r\nimpregnated with the fine and most homogeneous parts of these matters,\r\nand forms many different concretions, such as talcs, amianthus's, and\r\nvarious other substances produced by distillations through vitrifiable\r\nmatters.\r\n\r\nFlint, notwithstanding its hardness and density, has, like common\r\nmarble and hard stone, its exudations, from whence stalactites of\r\ndifferent kinds result, whose varieties of transparency, colours and\r\nconfiguration, are according to the nature of the flint which produces\r\nthem, and the different metallic or heterogeneous matters which it\r\ncontains. Rock crystal, all precious stones, white or coloured, and\r\neven diamonds, may be regarded as stalactites of this kind. Flints\r\nin small pieces, whose strata are generally concentric, are also\r\nstalactites, or parasitical stones; from flints of large dimensions,\r\nand most fine opaque stones, are only species of flint. Matters of\r\na vitrifiable kind, as we have observed, do not produce so great a\r\nvariety of concretions as those of the calcinable class; and these\r\nconcretions, produced by flints, are almost all hard and precious\r\nstones; whereas those of the calcareous are only soft matters of no\r\nvalue.\r\n\r\nPerpendicular clefts are found in rocks of flint, as well as in those\r\nof marble and hard stone; they are sometimes even larger there, which\r\nproves that matter is still dryer than stone: hills, whether of\r\ncalcinable or vitrifiable matters, are supported by clay or vitrifiable\r\nsand; these are the common and general matters of which the globe is\r\ncomposed, and which I look on as the lightest parts, or the scoria\r\nof vitrified matter, with which it is internally filled; thus all\r\nmountains or plains have argilaceous earth or sand for their common\r\nfoundation. For example, we see that in the pits at Amsterdam and Marly\r\nla Ville, vitrifiable sand was below every other stratum.\r\n\r\nIn most naked rocks it is observable that the sides of the\r\nperpendicular clefts, whether broad or narrow, correspond as exactly as\r\nthose of a piece of slit wood. In the large quarries in Arabia, which\r\nare almost composed of granate, these perpendicular separations are\r\nvery frequent; and although some are twenty or thirty yards wide, yet\r\nthe ridges exactly correspond and leave a deep cavity between them.[AK]\r\nIt is very common to find in perpendicular clefts shells broken in\r\nhalf, and each piece remaining fastened to the stone on the opposite\r\nside; which proves these shells were placed in the solid stratum, and\r\nbefore the cleft was made.[AL]\r\n\r\n[AK] See Shaw's Travels, vol. II. p. 83.\r\n\r\n[AL] See Woodward, page 198.\r\n\r\nIn some matters the perpendicular clefts are very wide, as in the\r\nquarries quoted by Shaw, which perhaps is the reason that they are not\r\nso frequently met with. In the quarries of flint and granate, the stone\r\nmay be cut out in very large pieces without the smallest inconveniency,\r\nas the obelisks and pillars seen at Rome, which are upwards of sixty,\r\neighty, an hundred, or one hundred and fifty feet long. It appears\r\nthat these large pillars were raised from the quarry, and that they\r\nare to be had of any required thickness, as well as some species of\r\nfree-stone. There are other matters where these perpendicular strata\r\nare very narrow; as in clay, marl, and chalk, and they are wider in\r\nmarble and most hard stones. Some are imperceptible from being filled\r\nwith a matter nearly similar to that of the stone itself, which\r\nnevertheless breaks off the continuity of the stone, and are what the\r\nworkmen call hairs. I have often remarked that in marble and stone\r\nthese hairs cross the blocks entirely, and differ from particular\r\nclefts only because their separation is not complete; these kind of\r\nclefts are filled with a transparent matter, which is a true spar.\r\nThere are a great number of considerable clefts in the quarries of\r\nfree-stone; this proceeds from these rocks often resting on less solid\r\nbases than marble or calcinable stones, which generally rest on clay.\r\nThere are many places where free-stone is not to be met with in large\r\nmasses; and in most quarries where it is good it lies in the form of\r\ncubes and parallel pipedes placed on each other in a very irregular\r\nmanner, as in the hills of Fontainbleau, which at a distance appear to\r\nbe the ruins of ancient buildings. This irregular disposition proceeds\r\nfrom the base of these hills being composed of sand, which permits the\r\nrocks to sink one on the other, particularly in places that formerly\r\nhave been worked, which has occasioned a great number of clefts and\r\nintervals between the blocks; and we may observe, in every country\r\nwhere sand and free-stone abound, that there are many pieces of rock\r\nand large stones in the middle of plains and vallies; whereas in a\r\ncountry consisting chiefly of marble and hard stone, these scattered\r\npieces, which have rolled from the hills and mountains, are very\r\nscarce, which proceeds only from the different solidity of the base on\r\nwhich these stones rest, and from the extent of the banks of marble and\r\ncalcinable stone, which is more considerable than that of free-stone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARTICLE XVIII.\r\n\r\nOF THE EFFECTS OF RAIN--OF MARSHES, SUBTERRANEOUS WOOD, AND WATER.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have already observed that rains, and the currents of water they\r\nproduce, continually detach from the heights of mountains sand, earth,\r\ngravel, &c. which they carry into plains, from whence the rivers\r\nconvey a part of them into the sea. Plains therefore are successively\r\nfilled, and by degrees raised higher, while mountains daily diminish.\r\nJoseph Blancanus relates various facts on this subject, which were of\r\npublic notoriety in his time, and which prove that mountains have been\r\nconsiderably lowered. In the county of Derby, in England, the steeple\r\nof the village Craich was not visible in 1572 from a certain mountain,\r\non account of the height of another which intervened; in eighty or an\r\nhundred years after, not only this steeple but every part of the church\r\nbecame visible from that very spot. Dr. Plot gives a similar example of\r\na mountain between Sibbertoft and Ashby, in Northamptonshire. The rain\r\nwaters not only carry with them the lightest parts of the mountains, as\r\nearth, gravel, and small stones, but even undermine and roll down large\r\nrocks, which considerably diminish the height of them. The mountains of\r\nWales are very steep and high, and the fragments of these rocks are to\r\nbe seen in large pieces at their feet, which as well as all fragments\r\nof rocks met with in vallies are the works of frosts and water. It is\r\nnot mountains of sand and earth alone which the rain causes to sink,\r\nfor they attack the hardest rocks, and carry with them large fragments\r\ninto the vallies. In a valley in Nant-phrancon, in 1685, a part of a\r\nlarge rock, which rested on a narrow base, having been undermined by\r\nthe waters, fell and broke in many pieces, the largest of which, in\r\ndescending, tore up a considerable trench in the plain, and crossed a\r\nsmall river on the other side of which it stopped. It is to similar\r\naccidents we must attribute the origin of all the large stones found\r\nadjacent to the mountains. We must recollect, as before observed, that\r\nthese large stones, scattered abroad, are more common in countries\r\nwhose mountains are composed of sand and free-stone, than in those\r\nwhere their composition is marble and clay, because sand is a less\r\nsolid foundation than clay.\r\n\r\nTo give an idea of the quantity of earth which the rain detaches from\r\nmountains and carries into the vallies, we shall quote a circumstance\r\nrelated by Dr. Plot; he says, in his Natural History of Staffordshire,\r\nthat 18 feet deep in the earth a great number of pieces of money had\r\nbeen found, coined in the reign of Edward IV. two hundred years before\r\nhis time, from which he concludes that the ground which is marshy has\r\nincreased above a foot in eleven years, or an inch and a twelfth every\r\nyear. A similar observation occurs with respect to some trees buried\r\nseventeen feet deep from the surface under which medals of Julius Cæsar\r\nwere found; so the earth, brought from the top of mountains by the\r\nwaters, considerably increases the elevation of the ground of plains.\r\n\r\nThis gravel, sand, and earth which the waters from mountains convey\r\ninto plains form strata, which must not be confounded with the ancient\r\nand original strata of the globe. In the former class must be placed\r\nthose of soft stone, gravel, and sand, the grains of which are washed\r\nand rounded; to these may be added, the strata of stones which are\r\nformed by a kind of incrustation; neither of which owe their origin\r\nto the motion or sediments of the sea. In these strata of soft and\r\nimperfect stones are found an infinity of vegetables, leaves, land and\r\nriver shells, and small bones of terrestrial animals, but never sea\r\nshells, or other marine productions; which evidently proves, together\r\nwith their want of solidity, that these strata are formed on the\r\nsurface of the dry land; and that they are more modern than those of\r\nmarble and other stones which contain shells, and were originally\r\nformed by the sea. All these modern stones appear to be hard and solid\r\nwhen they are first hewn out, but when, exposed to the weather, the air\r\nand rain presently dissolve them; their substance is so different from\r\ntrue stone, that when reduced into minute parts, to make sand of them,\r\nthey are converted into a kind of earth or clay. Stalactites, and other\r\nstony concretions, which Tournefort took for vegetated marble, are not\r\nreal stones, no more than those formed by the incrustations. We have\r\nalready shewn that tufa is not of ancient formation, and must not be\r\nranked in the class of stones. Tufa is an imperfect matter, differing\r\nfrom stone or earth, but which derives its origin from both by the\r\nmeans of rain water, as incrustations derive theirs from the deposit\r\nof the water of certain springs; therefore the strata of these matters\r\nare not ancient, nor been formed like the rest, by the sediments of\r\nthe sea. The strata of turf are also modern, and have been produced by\r\nthe successive assemblage of leaves and other perishable vegetables,\r\nand which are only preserved by a bitumous earth. Among these modern\r\nstrata we never meet with any marine production; but, on the contrary,\r\nmany vegetables, bones of land animals, and land and river shells, as\r\nmay be seen in the meadows, near Ashby, in the county of Northampton,\r\nwhere a great number of snail shells, plants, herbs, and many river\r\nshells are found all in good preservation, some feet deep in the earth,\r\nbut not a single marine shell among them.[AM]\r\n\r\n[AM] See Philosophical Trans. Abridg. XI. page 271.\r\n\r\nThese new strata have been formed by the water which runs on the\r\nsurface of the earth, often changing situation and dispersing on\r\nevery side. Part of these waters penetrate internally and flow across\r\nthe clefts of rocks and stones; and the reason we meet with no water\r\nin high lands, no more than on the tops of hills, is, because all\r\nelevations are generally composed of stone and rocks, therefore to\r\nfind water we must dig through the rock till we come to clay, or firm\r\nearth, on which these rocks stand, and we shall not meet with any water\r\nuntil the stone is pierced to the bottom: therefore, when the thickness\r\nof the rock, which must be pierced, is very considerable, as in lofty\r\nmountains, where they are often upwards of 1000 feet in height, it\r\nis impossible to dig to their base, and of course to have any water.\r\nThere are even large parts of land where there is not any water, as in\r\nArabia Petrea, which is a desert where no rain ever falls, where the\r\nscorching sand covers the whole surface of the earth, where there is\r\nscarcely any vegetable soil, where the few plants found are sickly, and\r\nwhere springs and wells are so very scarce that only five are reckoned\r\nbetween Cairo and Mount Sinai, and the water of them is salt and bitter.\r\n\r\nWhen the waters on the surface cannot find vent to flow they form\r\nmarshes and fens. The most famous marshes in Europe are those of\r\nMuscovy, at the source of the Tanais; and those of Savolaxia and\r\nEnasak, in Finland; there are also some in Holland, Westphalia, and\r\nother low countries: in Asia are the marshes of the Euphrates, of\r\nTartary, and of the Palus Meotis; nevertheless there are fewer of them\r\nin Asia and Africa than in Europe but America may be said to be but one\r\ncontinued marsh throughout all its plains, which is a greater proof of\r\nthe modern date of the country, and of the small number of inhabitants\r\nthan of their want of industry.\r\n\r\nThere are very great bogs in England, especially near the sea in\r\nLincolnshire, which has lost much ground on one side and gained it on\r\nthe other. In the ancient ground a great number of trees are found\r\nburied below the new ground, which has been deposited there by the\r\nwater. The same also are met with in Scotland, particularly at the\r\nmouth of the river Ness. Near Bruges, in Flanders, in digging to the\r\ndepth of 40 or 50 feet, a great quantity of trees were found, as close\r\nto each other as in a forest: the trunks, branches, and leaves, were\r\nso well preserved that the different kinds were easily distinguished.\r\nAbout 500 years since, the land where these trees were found was\r\ncovered by the sea, and before that time there is no trace or tradition\r\nthat it ever existed; nevertheless it must have been so, when these\r\ntrees stood and vegetated; therefore this ground, which formerly was\r\ncovered with wood, has been overwhelmed by the sea, the waters of\r\nwhich has, by degrees, deposited there between 40 and 50 feet of earth\r\nupon the former surface, and then retired. A number of subterraneous\r\ntrees have been also found at Youle, in Yorkshire, 12 miles below\r\nthe town, near the river Humber; there are some large enough for\r\nbuilding; and it is said, perhaps improperly, that this wood is as\r\ndurable as oak. The people cut them into long thin slips, and sell\r\nthem in the neighbouring towns, where they are used for lighting of\r\npipes. All these trees appear broken, and the trunks are separated from\r\nthe roots as if they had suffered the violence of a hurricane, or an\r\ninundation. This wood greatly resembles willow, it has the same smell\r\nwhen burnt, and makes charcoal exactly like it.[AN] In the Isle of Man\r\nthere is a marsh six miles long by three broad, it is called Curragh;\r\nsubterraneous trees, like willows, are found there, and although\r\nthey are 18 or 20 feet high, they are, nevertheless, firm on their\r\nroots.[AO] Trees are met with in almost every morass, bog, and marsh,\r\nin Somerset, Chester, Lancaster, and Stafford. There are some places\r\nwhere trees are found under the earth, which have been cut, sawed,\r\nsquared, and worked by the labour of man; and even wedges and saws have\r\nlikewise been found by them. Between Birmingham and Bromley, in the\r\ncounty of Lincoln, there are lofty hills of fine light sand, which the\r\nrain and wind sweep away, leaving uncovered the roots of large willow\r\ntrees, on which the impression of the axe is exceedingly plain. These\r\nhills, without doubt, have been formed like downs, by the accumulation\r\nof sand, which the waters of the sea has brought there and deposited at\r\ndifferent periods. A great number of these subterraneous trees are also\r\nfound in the marshy lands of Holland, Friesland, and near Groningen,\r\nfrom whence the turfs which they burn are dug.\r\n\r\n[AN] See Philosophical Transactions, No. 228.\r\n\r\n[AO] See Ray's Discourses, page 232.\r\n\r\nIn the earth are found trees of almost every kind, as willows, oaks,\r\nfirs, aspins, beach, yew, ash, hawthorn, &c. In the fens of Lincoln,\r\nalong the river Ouse, and in Hatfield-Chace, in the county of York,\r\nthese trees are as straight as we see them in a forest. The oaks are\r\nvery hard and used in buildings; they are said to last a long time,\r\nbut which I must doubt, as all trees that are dug out of the earth,\r\nat least all those which I have seen, whether oak or others, lose, in\r\ndrying, all the solidity, which they appeared to have at first. The ash\r\nis tender, and soon crumbles to dust. There are many trees which have\r\nclearly been shaped and sawed by men, and the hatchets, sometimes found\r\nnear them, resemble, in form, the knives anciently used in sacrifices.\r\nBesides trees, nuts, acorns, &c. are met with in great quantities, in\r\nmany other fenny parts of England and Ireland, as well as the morasses\r\nof France, Sweden, Savoy, and Italy.[AP]\r\n\r\n[AP] See Transactions Philosophical Abridg. Vol. IV, page 218, &c.\r\n\r\nIn the city of Modena, and four miles round, whatever part of the earth\r\nis dug, to the depth of sixty-three feet, and then bored five more with\r\nan auger, the water springs out with such great force, that the well\r\nis filled instantly; and this water continues always the same, neither\r\ndiminishing nor increasing by rain nor draught. What is more remarkable\r\nin this ground, when we reach the depth of fourteen feet, we find the\r\nruins of an ancient town, as paved streets, houses, different pieces of\r\nmosaic work, &c. After this is a very solid ground, which appears to\r\nhave never been stirred; yet below it we find a moist earth mixed with\r\nvegetables; and at twenty-six feet entire trees, as filberds with nuts\r\nthereon, and a great quantity of branches and leaves. At twenty-eight\r\nfeet is a stratum of chalk mixed with shells, and this bed is eleven\r\nfeet in thickness; after this we again meet with vegetables; and so on\r\nalternatively to the depth of sixty-three, feet, when there is a bed\r\nof sand mixed with gravel and shells, like those formed on the coasts\r\nof the Italian sea; these successive beds are always met with in the\r\nsame order, wheresoever it has been dug, and very often the auger\r\nmeets with large trunks of trees, which the workmen bore through with\r\nmuch labour. Bones of animals, coals, flint, and pieces of iron are\r\nalso found. Ramazzini, who relates these circumstances, thinks that\r\nthe gulph of Venice formerly extended beyond Modena, and, that by the\r\nsediments of rivers in the course of time, assisted perhaps by the\r\ninundations of the sea, this ground has been formed.\r\n\r\nI shall no longer dwell on the varieties in the formation of modern\r\nstrata, it suffices to have shewn that they have been produced by no\r\nother causes than the running and stagnate waters, which are upon the\r\nsurface of the earth, and that they are neither so hard nor solid as\r\nthe ancient strata which are formed under the waters of the sea.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARTICLE XIX.\r\n\r\nOF THE CHANGES OF LAND INTO SEA AND SEA INTO LAND.\r\n\r\n\r\nBy what has been said in the Articles I, VII, VIII, and IX, it appears\r\nthat great and general changes have happened to the terrestrial globe;\r\nand it is as certain, from what we have related in other articles, that\r\nthe surface of the earth has undergone particular alterations. Although\r\nthe order, or succession, of these particular alterations is not\r\nperfectly known, yet we are acquainted with the principal causes; we\r\ncan even distinguish their different effects; and if we could collect\r\nall the facts, which Natural and Civil History furnishes on the subject\r\nof the revolutions which have happened to the surface of the earth, we\r\ndo not doubt but that the Theory of the Earth which we have, laid down\r\nwould receive additional support.\r\n\r\nOne of the principal causes of these alterations is the motion of the\r\nsea; a motion it has endured from the earliest ages; for since the\r\nsun, moon, earth, waters, air, &c. have existed from the time of the\r\ncreation, the effects of the tides, the motion of the sea from east to\r\nwest, as well as that of the winds and currents, must have been felt\r\nfor the same space; and if even we should suppose the axis of the globe\r\nhad formerly another inclination, and that the continents, as well as\r\nthe sea, had another disposition, it does not destroy the motion of\r\nflux and reflux, nor alter the cause and effects of the winds: it is\r\nsufficient that the immense quantity of waters, which fill the vast\r\nspace of the sea, is found in some part on the globe of the earth, for\r\nwherever they had been collected they would have still been subject to\r\nthe same motions, and produced similar effects.\r\n\r\nWhen it was once supposed that our continent was formerly the bottom of\r\nthe sea, there was soon no doubt remaining thereon. The devastations\r\nof the sea, which are every where to be met with; the horizontal\r\nsituation of the strata of the earth; and the correspondence of hills\r\nand mountains, appear as so many convincing proofs; for by examining\r\nthe plains, vallies, and hills, we clearly perceive that the surface of\r\nthe earth has been formed by the waters. It is equally evident, when\r\nwe look into the interior parts of the earth, that those stones which\r\ncontain sea-shells, have been formed by the sediments of the waters,\r\nsince the shells are found filled with the same matter as that which\r\nsurrounds them; and lastly, by reflecting on the corresponding angles\r\nof opposite hills, we cannot doubt that their directions are the works\r\nof the currents of the sea. It is true, that since the earth has been\r\nleft uncovered, the original form of the surface has been constantly\r\nchanging; the mountains have diminished in height; the plains have been\r\nelevated; the angles of hills become more obtuse; many matters washed\r\naway by floods, or rivers, have taken a round shape; beds of gravel,\r\nsoft stone, &c. have been formed; but the essential matter is still\r\nremaining, the ancient form is still apparent, and I am persuaded that\r\nall the world may be convinced by their own inspection of what has been\r\nadvanced on this subject; and whoever attends to the observations and\r\nproofs I have given, will not doubt, the earth was formerly covered\r\nby the waters of the sea, and that it is the currents of the sea which\r\nhave given to the surface of the earth, the form we at present perceive.\r\n\r\nThe principal motion of the sea is, as we have already observed, from\r\neast to west. It also appears that the sea has gained above 500 leagues\r\nof ground on the eastern coasts of both the old and new continents; for\r\nthe proofs of which we refer to those given in Article XI. and shall\r\nonly add thereto, that all straits which join two seas, are directed\r\nfrom east to west; the straits of Magellan, Frobisher, of Hudson,\r\nof Ceylon, and those of the seas of Corea and Kamtschatka have all\r\nthis direction, and appear to have been formed by the currents of the\r\nwaters, which being impelled from east to west, opened these passages\r\nin the same direction, and in which they preserve a more considerable\r\nmotion than in any other; for in these straits there are high and\r\nviolent tides, whereas in those situated on the western coasts,\r\nlike that of Gibraltar, Sund, &c. the motion of the tides is almost\r\ninsensible.\r\n\r\nThe inequalities of the bottom of the sea change the direction of the\r\nwater's motion; they have been successively produced by the sediments\r\nof the water, and by matters transported by the tides or other motions;\r\nfor we do not consider the motion of the tides as the sole cause of\r\nthose inequalities, but only as the principal and first, because it\r\nis the most constant and acts without interruption; the action of the\r\nwinds is another cause; the action of which beginning at the surface,\r\nextends to considerable depths, as is plain from the matters that are\r\nloosened and thrown up by a storm from the bottom of the sea, and which\r\nnever happens but in tempestuous weather.\r\n\r\nWe have already mentioned that between the tropics, and even some\r\ndegrees beyond them, an east wind continually blows; this wind, which\r\ncontributes to the general motion of the sea from east to west, is as\r\nancient as the flux and reflux, since it depends on the rarefaction\r\nof the air, produced by the heat of the sun. Here then are two united\r\ncauses of motion, the greatest of which is near the equator. The first,\r\nthe tides which are more sensibly felt in southern latitudes: and the\r\nsecond, the east wind which blows continually in the same climates.\r\nThese two causes have concurred, ever since the formation of the globe,\r\nto produce a motion in the waters from east to west, and to agitate\r\nthem more in that part of the globe than in all the rest. It is for\r\nthis reason that the greatest inequalities of the surface of the globe\r\nare found between the tropics. The part of Africa, comprehended between\r\nthese two circles, is only a group of mountains whose different chains\r\nextend for the most part from east to west, as is evident from the\r\ndirection of the great rivers of this part of the world; it is the same\r\nwith those parts of Asia and America which are comprised between the\r\ntropics.\r\n\r\nFrom the combination of the general motion of the sea from east to\r\nwest, with the flux and reflux of the currents, and the winds, an\r\ninfinite number of different effects has resulted, both on the bottom\r\nof the sea, and on the coasts. Varenius says, it is very probable that\r\nthe gulphs and straits have been formed by the reiterated efforts of\r\nthe ocean against the land; that the Mediterranean sea, the gulphs of\r\nArabia, Bengal, and Cambay, have been formed by the eruption of the\r\nwaters, as well as the straits between Sicily and Italy, between Ceylon\r\nand India, between Greece and Euboea, and that it is the same with\r\nrespect to the straits of the Manillas, Magellan, &c. that one proof\r\nof these eruptions, and that the sea has forsaken different lands is,\r\nthat but few islands are to be met with in the great seas, and never\r\na great number of islands close to each other; that in the immense\r\nspace occupied by the Pacific sea, not above two or three small islands\r\nare to be found towards the middle of it; that in the vast Atlantic\r\nocean, between Africa and the Brazils, we only find the small islands\r\nof St. Helena and Ascension; but that all islands are near the great\r\ncontinents, as those of the Archipelago, near the continents of Europe\r\nand Asia, the Canaries, near Africa, all the islands of the Indian sea,\r\nnear the eastern coast of Asia; the Antille islands, close to that of\r\nAmerica, and that only the Azores lie at any great distance in the sea\r\nbetween Europe and America.\r\n\r\nThe inhabitants of Ceylon say, that their island was separated from\r\nthe peninsula of India by an eruption of the ocean; and this popular\r\ntradition is very probable. It is also imagined the island of Sumatra\r\nhas been separated from the continent, and the great number of shoals\r\nand sand banks are a strong proof of it. The Malabars assert, that\r\nthe Maldivian islands formed a part of the continent of India, and in\r\ngeneral it may be reasonably supposed that all the eastern islands\r\nhave been divided from the continents by eruptions of the ocean.[AQ]\r\n\r\n[AQ] See Varenius Geography, page 203, 217, and 220.\r\n\r\nThere is an appearance that formerly the island of Great Britain\r\nwas part of the continent, and that England was joined to France;\r\nthe similarity of the stones on the two coasts, and the narrowness\r\nof this strait seem plainly to indicate it. By supposing, says Dr.\r\nWallis, \"that England formerly communicated with France, by an isthmus\r\nbetween Dover and Calais, it must follow that the sea would be carried\r\nagainst both sides of it with great violence by the tides twice in\r\nevery twenty-four hours, the German ocean, which is between England\r\nand Holland, striking of it on the eastern side, and that of France on\r\nthe west, would be sufficient in time to wear away so narrow a neck\r\nof land, as we have supposed. The tides acting with great violence,\r\nnot only against this isthmus but also against the coasts of France\r\nand England, must have washed away a great quantity of sand, earth,\r\nand clay, from every part against which the sea was forced: but, being\r\nstopt in its course, it would not deposite, as might be supposed, their\r\nsediments against this isthmus, but transported them into the great\r\nplain that now forms Romney Marsh, which is eight miles long by four\r\nbroad; for whosoever has seen this plain, cannot doubt but that it\r\nwas formerly covered with the sea, as it would be still overflowed by\r\nspring tides if it was not for the Dikes of Dimchurch.\"\r\n\r\nThe German sea must have acted in the same manner against this isthmus,\r\nand the coasts of England and Flanders would convey its sediments into\r\nHolland and Zealand, the ground of which, though formerly covered\r\nwith water, is now forty feet above. On the coast of England, the\r\nGerman sea must have filled up that large valley, where the river\r\nStour actually flows for more than 20 miles, beginning at Sandwich,\r\npassing Canterbury, Chatham, Chilham as far as Ashford. At this place\r\nthe ground is much higher than it was formerly, since at Chatham the\r\nbones of an hippopotamus were found seventeen feet deep in the earth,\r\ntogether with anchors and marine shells.\r\n\r\nIt is very probable the sea may form new land, by bringing and\r\ndepositing, at particular places, sand, earth, mud, &c. for in the\r\nisland of Orkney, which is adjacent to Romney Marsh, there was a tract\r\nof low land continually in danger of being inundated by the river\r\nRother; but in less than 60 years this ground has been considerably\r\nelevated by quantities of earth and mud being brought thither every\r\ntide, and the channel through which it enters, in less than fifty years\r\nhas deepened so much as to admit of the reception of large vessels,\r\nwhereas at that time it was a ford over which people might pass.\r\n\r\nIn this manner, the sand bank was formed which extends obliquely from\r\nthe coast of Norfolk to that of Zealand. This bank forms that part\r\nwhere the tides of the German and French sea meet, since the isthmus\r\nhas been broken, and where the earth and sand are deposited which are\r\nwashed away from the coasts; nor is it by any means improbable but that\r\nin the course of time this bank may become an isthmus.[AR]\r\n\r\n[AR] See Abridgment of Philosophical Transactions, vol. II. page 227.\r\n\r\nThere is a great appearance, says Ray, that the island of Great Britain\r\nwas formerly joined to France, and formed part of that continent: but\r\nit is not known whether its separation was caused by an earthquake,\r\nan eruption of the ocean, or by the labour of man; but that this\r\nisland formed part of the continent is evident, from the rocks and\r\ncoasts of both being of the same nature, composed of the same matters,\r\nand exactly of the same height; the length of the rocks, along these\r\ncoasts, are also nearly the same, about six miles on either side. The\r\nlittle breadth of the channel, which in this part is not more than\r\ntwenty-four English miles, and its shallowness, comparatively with the\r\nneighbouring sea, is another reason to suppose that England has been\r\ndivided from France by accident. We may add to these proofs, that there\r\nwere formerly wolves and bears in this island; it is not to be presumed\r\nthat they could swim over, nor that men transported such destructive\r\nanimals; for in general we find the noxious animals of the continent\r\nin the adjacent islands, and never in those which are separated from\r\nthem by a great distance; as the Spaniards remarked when they landed in\r\nAmerica.[AS]\r\n\r\n[AS] See Ray's Discourses, page 208.\r\n\r\nIn the reign of Henry I. King of England, a great inundation happened\r\nby an eruption of the sea in part of Flanders. In 1446 by a like\r\neruption 10,000 persons were drowned in the territory of Dordrecht, and\r\nmore than 100,000 round Dullart, Friezeland, and in Zealand. In these\r\nlast two provinces upwards of 300 villages were overflowed; the tops of\r\ntheir towers and steeples are still to be seen rising out of the water.\r\n\r\nFrom the coasts of France, England, Holland and Germany, the sea has\r\nretreated in many parts. Hubert Thomas relates, in his description\r\nof Liege, that the sea formerly surrounded the walls of the city of\r\nTongres, which is now more than 35 leagues distant from it; this he\r\nproves by many eligible reasons, and, among others, he says; that in\r\nhis time the iron rings, to which the ships were moored, were to be\r\nseen remaining in the walls. We may likewise look on as lands deserted\r\nby the sea, the fens of Lincoln in England, Provence in France, and\r\nwhich has also very considerably retreated from the mouth of the Rhone\r\nsince the year 1665. In Italy a considerable tract of land has been\r\ngained at the mouth of the Arno; and Ravenna, formerly a sea-port, is\r\nno longer a maritime town. Holland appears to be an entire new country,\r\nwhere the surface of the earth is almost on a level with the sea,\r\nalthough the land is considerably elevated by the daily deposit of\r\nmud and earth from the Rhine, Maese, &c. for it was formerly computed\r\nthat the ground of Holland was, in many places, 50 feet lower than the\r\nbottom of the sea.\r\n\r\nIt is asserted, that in the year 860, a furious tempest drove on the\r\ncoast so great a quantity of sand that it shut up the mouth of the\r\nRhine, near the Cat, and that this river inundated the whole country,\r\ntore up trees and houses, and, at last, emptied itself into the\r\nchannel of the Maese. In 1421 another inundation separated the town\r\nof Dordrecht from the main land, submerged 72 villages, many castles,\r\nand drowned 100,000 souls, beside a great number of cattle. The dyke\r\nof Yssel was broken in 1638 by the ice brought down by the Rhine,\r\nwhich, having shut up the passage of the water, made an opening of some\r\nfathoms, and a great part of the province was overflowed before the\r\nbreach could be repaired. In 1682 there was a similar inundation in\r\nthe province of Zealand, which destroyed upwards of 30 villages, and\r\ndrowned a considerable number of people and cattle, from their being\r\nsurprised by the waters in the night. It was a fortunate circumstance\r\nfor Holland that a south wind opposed the inroad of the sea, for it\r\nwas so greatly swelled that the water was 18 feet higher than the\r\nhighest ground of the province.[AT]\r\n\r\n[AT] See the Historical Voyages of Europe, vol V. page 70.\r\n\r\nAt Hithe, in the county of Kent, the harbour has filled up in defiance\r\nof every expence and precaution that was made to prevent it. A\r\nsurprising number of sea-shells, &c. are met with for several miles\r\nround, which were formerly heaped together, and which are now covered\r\nby earth, and are beautiful meadows. On the other side the sea has\r\ngained in several places, as for instance, the Goodwin Sands, which was\r\nan estate belonging to an Earl of that name, but at present is no more\r\nthan sand covered by the waters of the sea: thus the sea in many places\r\ngains on the land and loses in others, according to the different\r\nsituation of the coasts, and other circumstances.[AU]\r\n\r\n[AU] See Abridg. Philosophical Trans. vol. IV. p. 234.\r\n\r\nOn Mount Stella, in Portugal, is a lake in which the wrecks of ships\r\nhave been found, notwithstanding this mountain is more than 12\r\nleagues from the sea.[AV] Sabinius, in his Commentaries on Ovid's\r\nMetamorphoses, says, that in the year 1460 a ship, with its anchors,\r\nwas found in a mine of the Alps.\r\n\r\n[AV] See Gordon's Geography, page 149.\r\n\r\nIt is not in Europe alone we meet with these vicissitudes of land into\r\nsea and sea into land; other parts of the world might furnish more\r\nremarkable, and in a greater number, if investigated with precision.\r\n\r\nCalecut was formerly a famous city and the capital of a kingdom of that\r\nname; at present it is only a trifling town, meanly built, and but\r\nthinly inhabited: the sea, which for a century has gained greatly on\r\nthis coast, has overflowed the greatest part of the old city, with a\r\nbeautiful fortress of stone which was therein. Vessels at present moor\r\non their ruins, and the port is filled with a great number of shoals,\r\nand on which ships are frequently wrecked.[AW]\r\n\r\n[AW] See Letters Edifiantes Recueil 11. page 187.\r\n\r\nThe province of Jucatan, a peninsula in the gulph of Mexico, was\r\nformerly a part of the sea. This neck of ground extends 100 leagues in\r\nlength, and is not more than 25 leagues at its greatest breadth. The\r\nair is perfectly hot and moist. Although there are neither rivulets nor\r\nrivers throughout so long a space, the water is every where so nigh the\r\nsurface as to furnish plenty; and, by opening the earth, so great a\r\nnumber of shells are found as to leave no doubt that this great extent\r\nmay be regarded as a place which formerly was part of the sea.\r\n\r\nThe inhabitants of Malabar pretend that formerly the Maldivian islands\r\nwere attached to the Indian continent, and that the violence of the\r\nsea has divided them from it. The number of these islands is so great,\r\nand some of the channels, which separate them, are so narrow, that\r\nthe boltsprits of vessels which pass them tear off the leaves of the\r\ntrees on each side, and in some places an active man, by holding by the\r\nbranch of a tree, may leap into another island.[AX]\r\n\r\n[AX] See the Dutch Travels to the East-Indies, page 274.\r\n\r\nThe cocoa-trees, which are at the bottom of the sea, is a proof that\r\nthe Maldivians were formerly part of the continent: cocoa-nuts are\r\noften detached from them and thrown on the shore by a storm.\r\n\r\nIt is imagined that the island of Ceylon was formerly united to the\r\ncontinent, and that the currents, which are extremely rapid in many\r\nparts of India, have divided that as well as Rammanakoil, and many\r\nother islands.[AY] However, it is certain that the island of Ceylon\r\nhas lost 30 or 40 leagues of ground towards the north-west side, which\r\nthe sea has gained.\r\n\r\n[AY] See the Dutch Travels to the East-Indies, vol. II. p. 486.\r\n\r\nIt appears that the sea has recently forsaken a great part of the\r\nprojecting lands and islands of America. We have just observed, that\r\nthe ground of Jucatan is filled with shells. It is the same with the\r\nlow lands of Martinico and the other Antille islands. The inhabitants\r\nhave termed the earth below the surface lime, because they make\r\ntheir lime with these shells, considerable banks of which are found\r\nimmediately under the vegetable earth. In the new voyages to the\r\nislands of America it is said, \"lime, which is found in the land of\r\nGuadaloupe, when the earth is turned up, is of the same kind as that\r\ndrawn out of the sea, the reason of which is difficult to be assigned.\r\nMight it not be possible, that all the extent of ground, which composes\r\nthis island, was, in former times, only a high ground filled with\r\nlime-plants, which having grown and filled the void spaces that were\r\noccupied by the water, have raised up the ground, obliged the water\r\nto retire, and leave all the superficies dry? This conjecture, as\r\nextraordinary as at first it may appear, has, nevertheless, nothing\r\nimpossible in it; and if the people who reside there were to dig in\r\ndifferent parts of the earth they would discover what the real soil is,\r\nand by that means destroy or strengthen my conjecture.\"\r\n\r\nThere are some lands which are sometimes covered with water and\r\nsometimes uncovered, as many islands in Norway, Scotland, Maldivias,\r\nthe gulph of Cambaya, &c. The Baltic has, by little and little, gained\r\na great part of Pomerania, and covered and destroyed the famous port of\r\nVineta. So likewise the sea of Norway has projected into the continent,\r\nand formed many small islands. The German sea has projected into\r\nHolland near Cat, insomuch that the ruins of an ancient citadel of\r\nthe Romans, which was formerly on the coast, are now very far in the\r\nsea. The marshy grounds in the Isle of Ely, in England, and those in\r\nProvence, in France, are, on the contrary, as we have observed, land\r\nwhich the sea has abandoned. Downs have been formed by the sea-winds,\r\nwhich have thrown and accumulated earth, sand, shells, &c. on the\r\nshore. For example, on the western coast of France, Spain, and Africa,\r\ndurable and violent westerly winds reign, which impel the waters\r\ntowards the shore with great impetuosity, and on which coasts downs are\r\nvery frequent. In the like manner the easterly winds, when they remain\r\nany long time, so strongly drive the waters from the coasts of Syria\r\nand Phoenicia that the chain of rocks, which are covered with water\r\nduring the westerly winds, are left quite dry. Thus downs are never\r\ncomposed of stone, or marble, like mountains formed in the bottom of\r\nthe sea, because they have not been long enough under the water. In our\r\ndiscourse on minerals we shall shew that the sea possesses the power\r\nof petrifaction, and that the stones formed in the earth are quite\r\ndifferent from those formed in the sea.\r\n\r\nWhen I had just finished my Theory of the Earth, which I composed in\r\n1744, I received from Mons. Barrere, his dissertation on the origin of\r\nfigured stones, and I was pleased to find myself of the same opinion\r\nwith this able naturalist, on the subject of the formation of downs,\r\nand the time the water remained on the earth which we inhabit; he\r\nrecounts many alterations which have happened to the sea coasts:\r\n\"_Aiguis-mortes_, which is now more than a league and a half from the\r\nsea, was a port in the time of St. Louis: Psalmodi was an island in\r\n815, and at present it is inland two leagues from the sea. It is the\r\nsame with respect to Maguelone. The greatest part of the vineyards of\r\nAgde, was forty years ago covered by the sea: and in Spain the sea\r\nhas considerably retreated within a short space of time from Blancs,\r\nBadalona, the mouth of the river Vobregat, Cape Tortosa, along the\r\ncoasts of Valentia, &c.\r\n\r\n\"The sea may form hills and mountains in many different manners;\r\nfirst, by the transportations of earth, sand, and shells, from one\r\nplace to another; secondly, by depositing sediments, consisting of\r\nsmall particles detached from the coasts and bottom, and which it\r\nmight have transported from a considerable distance; and lastly, by\r\nsand, mud, and other articles, which the sea winds often drive against\r\ncoasts, downs and hills may be produced, which the water forsaking,\r\nby degrees, become parts of the continent.\" The downs of Flanders and\r\nHolland are of this kind, being only hills composed of sand and shells,\r\nwhich the sea winds have driven towards the land. Mons. Barrere quotes\r\nanother example which merits a place in this work. \"The sea, by its\r\nmotion, detaches from its bottom an infinity of plants, shells, slime,\r\nand sand, which the waves and winds continually drive towards the\r\nshore. Now, all these different operations must continually form new\r\nstrata, elevate the beds of earth, gradually raising downs and hills,\r\nretrenching the bounds of the ocean, and by that means extending the\r\nlands on the continents.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is visible that new strata have been successively formed by the\r\nsame reiterated motion of the waters from the deposition of sediments\r\nand other constant causes from time immemorial; of which I find strong\r\nproofs in the different beds of fossils, shells, and other marine\r\nproductions found in Roussillon near the village of Naffiac, about\r\nseven or eight leagues from the sea; these beds of shells which are\r\ninclined from the west to the east, and in different angles, are\r\nseparated from each other by banks of sand and earth, are sometimes\r\nfrom one and a half to two or three feet in thickness. They appear\r\nas if sprinkled with salt in dry weather, and form together hillocks\r\nfrom twenty-five to thirty fathoms in height: now a long chain of\r\nhills of such an height can only be formed gradually, and at different\r\nsuccessions of time. Such might be the effect of an universal deluge,\r\nwhich must have disturbed all nature; but which could not have given a\r\nregular form to these different beds of fossil shells, but would have\r\njumbled them together without any order or regularity.\"\r\n\r\nOn this subject I am perfectly of the same opinion as M. Barrere,\r\nexcepting as to the formation of mountains, which I cannot agree\r\nought to be entirely attributed to the causes which occasion the\r\nocean to gain upon the land on some parts, and lose it upon others.\r\nAs I am, on the contrary, of opinion, I could produce many convincing\r\narguments to prove that most of the eminencies seen on the surface of\r\nthe earth have been actually formed in the sea itself. First, because\r\nthey have a correspondence of saillant and returning angles, which\r\nnecessarily implies the cause we have assigned, that is, the motion of\r\nthe currents. Secondly, because downs and hills, which are formed by\r\nthe materials that the sea brings on its shores, are not composed of\r\nmarble and hard stone, like common hills; the shells also in the former\r\nare generally only fossils, whereas in the latter, the petrifaction is\r\ncompleat; besides the beds of earth are not so horizontal in downs\r\nas in the hills composed of marble and hard stone, but are more or\r\nless inclined, as in the hills of Naffiac, whereas in the hills and\r\nmountains, formed under the water by the sediment of the sea, the\r\nstrata are always parallel, and very often horizontal, and the shells\r\nand other marble are entirely petrified. I have no doubt of proving\r\nthat marble and other calcinable matters, which are almost all composed\r\nof madrepores, astroites, and shells, have acquired their hardness and\r\nperfection at the bottom of the sea; on the contrary, gravel, soft\r\nstones, incrustations, stalactites, &c. which are also calcinable and\r\nfound in the earth, and formed since our continent has been discovered,\r\ncannot acquire this degree of hardness and petrifaction which marble or\r\nhard stones have.\r\n\r\nIn the history of the French Academy for 1708, may be seen the\r\nobservations of Saulmon, on the subject of the galets found in many\r\nplaces. These galets are round and flat flints very smooth, and which\r\nare cast on the shores by the sea. At Bayeux, and at Prutel, which\r\nare a league from the sea, we find them in digging wells or pits. The\r\nmountains of Bonneuil, Broie, and Quesny, which are eighteen leagues\r\nfrom the sea, are all covered with galets; they are also found in the\r\nvalley of Clermont in Beauvois. M. Saulmon likewise relates, that a\r\nhole, 16 feet deep, was bored horizontally into the beach of Tresport,\r\nwhich is soft earth, and that it entirely disappeared in 30 years: so\r\nthat if the sea always encroaches alike, it would gain half a league in\r\n12,000 years.\r\n\r\nThe motions of the sea are therefore the principal causes of the\r\nalterations which have happened, and which daily happen on the surface\r\nof the globe. But there are many, other causes, which, though less\r\nconsiderable, contribute to those changes. Running waters, rivers,\r\nstreams, the melting of snow, torrents, frosts, &c. have occasioned\r\nmany changes; the rains have diminished the height of mountains; rivers\r\nand rivulets have raised plains, and stopped up the sea at their\r\nmouths; the melting of snow, and torrents, have dug hollows in vallies;\r\nand the frosts have split rocks and separated them from their former\r\nstations. We might quote an infinity of examples on the alterations\r\nthese causes have occasioned. Varenius says, that rivers convey into\r\nthe sea great quantities of earth, which they deposit at a greater or\r\nless distance from the coasts, according to the rapidity of their\r\ncurrents; these earths fall to the bottom of the sea, and, at first,\r\nform those small banks which daily encrease, become shoals, and, at\r\nlast, form islands, which are fertile and inhabitable. This is the\r\nmanner in which the islands of the Nile are formed, as well as those\r\nof St. Laurence, the Isle of Landa, situate on the coast of Africa,\r\nnear the mouth of the river Coanza, the island of Norway, &c.[AZ] To\r\nthese may be added the island of Trong Ming, at China, which has been\r\ngradually formed by the earth that the river Nankin has brought and\r\ndeposited it at its mouth. This island is more than 20 leagues long by\r\nfive or six broad.[BA]\r\n\r\n[AZ] See Varenni Geograph. page 214.\r\n\r\n[BA] See Letters Edifiantes, Recueil xi. page 234.\r\n\r\nThe Po, Trento, Athesis, and other rivers of Italy, bring with them\r\ngreat quantities of earths into the lakes of Venice, especially during\r\nthe time of inundations, which, in course of time, must fill them\r\nup. In many places they are now dry at low water, and, excepting the\r\ncanals, which are kept up at a great expence, have no depth of water.\r\n\r\nAt the mouths of the Nile, the Ganges, the Indus, the Plata, the\r\nNankin, and of many other rivers, the earth and sand deposited form\r\nconsiderable banks. Loubere, in his Voyage to Siam, says, that the\r\nbanks of sand and earth daily increase at the mouths of the great\r\nrivers of Asia, insomuch that the navigation of them becomes every day\r\nmore difficult, and will one day be impassable. The same remark may\r\nbe made of the large rivers of Europe, and particularly of the Wolga,\r\nwhich has more than 70 mouths in the Caspian sea, and of the Danube,\r\nwhich has seven in the Black sea, &c.\r\n\r\nAs it seldom rains in Egypt the regular inundations of the Nile proceed\r\nfrom the torrents which fall therein from Ethiopa. These annually\r\nbring with them great quantities of mud, which they not only deposit\r\non the land of Egypt but even throw to a considerable distance in the\r\nsea, and thus lay the foundation of a new land, which, in the course\r\nof time, arises therefrom; for, by sounding with the lead, we find,\r\nat more than 20 leagues distance from the coast, the mud of the Nile\r\nat the bottom of the sea, and which is every year increasing. Lower\r\nEgypt, where[BB] Dela at present stands, was formerly a gulph of the\r\nsea. Homer tells us that the island of Pharos was 24 hours voyage from\r\nEgypt, and at present it is almost contiguous to it. The soil of Egypt\r\nhas not the same depth of good ground throughout its extent, it lessens\r\nas we approach the sea. Near the borders of the Nile there is sometimes\r\nnear thirty feet depth of good earth, whereas at the extremity of the\r\ninundation there is scarcely more than seven inches.[BC] The town of\r\nDamietta, at present more than 10 miles from the sea, in 1243 was a\r\nsea-port. The town of Fooah, which, 300 years ago, was situate at the\r\nmouth of the Canopic, a branch of the Nile, is now more than seven\r\nleagues from it. Within 40 years the sea has retreated half a league\r\nfrom before Rosetta and Idern.\r\n\r\n[BB] See Diodorus de Suc, lib. 3. Aristotle, lib. 1. of Meteors, h.\r\nxiv. Herodotus, f. 4, 5, &c.\r\n\r\n[BC] See Shaw's Travels, vol. II. page 185, and 186.\r\n\r\nThe great rivers of America, and even those which have been but\r\nlately discovered, have suffered great alterations at their mouths.\r\nCharlevoix, speaking of the river Mississipi, says, that at its mouth,\r\nbelow New Orleans, the country forms a point of land which does not\r\nappear to be very ancient, for by digging but a little into the earth\r\nwater is met with; besides, the quantity of small islands which have\r\nrecently been formed at all the mouths of this river, leaves no doubt\r\nof this neck of land being formed after the same manner. It appears\r\ncertain, says he, that when M. de la Salle went down the Mississipi, to\r\nthe sea, the mouth of this river was not as it is at this present time.\r\n\r\n\"The nearer we approach towards the sea, adds he, the more it becomes\r\nperceptible, the bar has scarcely any water in most of the small\r\noutlets which the river has opened, and which have multiplied so\r\ngreatly from the trees that are carried along with the currents, one of\r\nwhich stopt in a part where it is shallow, will entangle hundreds. I\r\nhave seen, continues he, 200 leagues from New Orleans, collections of\r\ntrees, one of which would have filled all the timber-yards of Paris.\r\nNothing can set them free; the mud which the river brings down serves\r\nto cement, and, by degrees, covers them. Each inundation leaves a new\r\nstratum, and, after 10 years, shrubs and vegetables grow thereon: after\r\nthis manner most points and islands are formed, which so often change\r\nthe course of rivers.\"[BD]\r\n\r\n[BD] See Charlevoix Travels, vol. II. page 440.\r\n\r\nNevertheless all the changes which rivers cause are very slow, and\r\nbecome not considerable till after a long series of years: but quick\r\nand sudden changes have happened by inundations and earthquakes.\r\nThe ancient Egyptian priests, 600 years before the birth of Christ,\r\nasserted, according to the Timæus of Plato, that there was a great\r\nisland near Hercules Pillars; called _Atlantis_, which was larger than\r\nLybia and Asia taken together; and that this island was buried under\r\nthe waters of the ocean after a great earthquake. \"Traditur Atheniensis\r\ncivitas restitisse olim innumeris hostium copiis quæ, ex Atlantico mari\r\nprofectæ, prope cunctam Europam Asiamque obsederunt; tunc enim fretum\r\nillud navigabile habens in ore et quasi vestibulo ejus insulam quam\r\nHerculis columnas cognominant; ferturque insula illa Lybiâ simul et\r\nAsiâ Major fuisse, per quam ad alias proximas insulas patebat aditus,\r\natque ex insulis ad omnem continentem è conspectu jacentem vero mari\r\nvicinam: sed intrà os ipsum portes augusto sinu traditur, pelagus illud\r\nverum mare, terra quoque illa verè erat continens, &c. Post hæc ingenti\r\nterræ motu jugique diei unius et noctis illuvione factum est, ut terra\r\ndehiscens omnis illos bellicosos absorberet, et Atlantis insula sub\r\nvasto gurgite mergeretur.\" _Plato in Timæus._ This ancient tradition\r\nis not absolutely contrary to all probability. The earths which were\r\nabsorbed by the waters are perhaps those which join Ireland to the\r\nAzores, and those to the continent of America; for in Ireland there are\r\nthe same fossils, shells, and marine productions as in America, some of\r\nwhich are different from any found in other parts of Europe,\r\n\r\nEusebius relates two testimonies on the subject of deluges: one of\r\nwhich is Melo, who says that the plains of Syria had formerly been\r\nlaid under water; the other is Abydenus, who says, that in the time\r\nof King Sisithrus there was a great deluge, which had been predicted\r\nby Saturnus, Plutarch _De Solestia Animalium_. Ovid, and other\r\nmythologists, speak of the deluge of Deucalion, which, according to\r\nthem, was in Thessaly, about 700 years from the universal deluge. It is\r\nalso asserted that there had been one more ancient in Attica, in the\r\ntime of Ogiges, about 230 years before that of Deucalion.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1095 there was a deluge in Syria, which drowned a number\r\nof people.[BE] In 1164 there was so considerable a one in Friezeland,\r\nthat all maritime coasts were covered, and several thousands of the\r\ninhabitants drowned.[BF] In 1218 there was another inundation which\r\ndestroyed near an hundred thousand people. There are a multitude of\r\nother examples of great inundations, like that of 1604 in England, and\r\nmany more.\r\n\r\n[BE] See Alsted. Chron. chap. 25.\r\n\r\n[BF] See Krank, Lib. 5, cap. 4.\r\n\r\nA third cause of the change on the surface of the globe, are impetuous\r\nwinds. They not only form downs and hills on the sea shores, but they\r\noften stop and choak up rivers, and change their directions; they tear\r\nup cultivated land, destroy trees, overthrow edifices, and cover entire\r\ncountries with sand. We have an example of these inundations of sand on\r\nthe coasts of Britany in France: the history of the Royal Academy at\r\nParis, anno 1722, makes mention of it in the following terms.\r\n\r\n\"In the environs of St. Paul de Leon, in Lower Britany, there is a\r\nquarter near the sea, which before the year 1666, was inhabited; but\r\nis so no longer, by reason of a sand which covers it to the height of\r\nmore than twenty feet, and which gains ground every year. Reckoning\r\nfrom that time it has proceeded upwards of six leagues into the\r\ncountry, and is now not more than about half a league from St. Paul, so\r\nthat according to all appearance that town must soon be deserted. The\r\ntops of some steeples and chimnies are still seen peeping out of this\r\nsea of sand; the inhabitants of the interred villages have always had\r\nsufficient time to quit their houses in safety.\r\n\r\n\"An east or north wind increases this calamity, by raising up a sand of\r\na very fine nature, which sweeps it away in such great quantities, and\r\nwith such velocity, that M. Deslandes, to whom the academy are indebted\r\nfor this observation, when walking in that country during an east wind,\r\nwas obliged, from time to time, to wipe it off his hat and cloaths they\r\nwere so loaded with sand, and felt so heavy. Besides, when this wind is\r\nviolent, it throws this sand over a small arm of the sea into Roscof,\r\na small port much frequented by foreign vessels; the sand collects\r\nin their streets to the height of two feet, and the inhabitants are\r\nobliged to have it carted away. There are many ferruginous particles\r\nin this sand, which are easily discovered by a magnet.\r\n\r\n\"The coast which furnishes this sand extends from St. Paul as far as\r\nPlouefoat, somewhat more than four leagues. The disposition of the\r\nplace is such that only the east or the north-east wind can convey the\r\nsand over the lands. It is easy to be conceived how the sand, conveyed\r\nand accumulated by the wind in one part, can again be taken up by the\r\nsame wind and carried farther, and that the sand can thus advance into\r\nand cover the country while the mine which furnishes it continues\r\nunexhausted; for without this the sand, by advancing, would always\r\ndiminish in height, and would cease its destructive ravages. Now it is\r\nbut too possible that the sea throws up or deposits new sand in the\r\nplace from whence the wind raises it up, and therefore the dreadful\r\neffects may long continue.\r\n\r\n\"The disaster is but of modern date, possibly the shoal which furnishes\r\nit has not yet a sufficient quantity to lift itself above the surface\r\nof the sea, or perhaps the sea has but just left it uncovered. There\r\nhas been some alteration on the coast, and the sea at present reaches,\r\nat high water, half a league beyond certain rocks that formerly it\r\nnever passed.\r\n\r\n\"This unhappy province justifies what the ancient and modern travellers\r\nrelate concerning the tempests of sand in the deserts of Arabia, in\r\nwhich cities and armies have been enveloped and destroyed.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Shaw tells us that the ports of Laodicea, Jebila, Tortosa, Rowada,\r\nTripoli, Tyre, Acra, and Jaffa, are all filled up with sand brought\r\nthither by the great waves which beat on that side of the Mediterranean\r\nwhen the west wind blows impetuously.[BG]\r\n\r\n[BG] See Shaw's Travels, vol. II.\r\n\r\nIt is useless to give a greater number of examples of the alterations\r\nthat have happened on the surface of the globe. Fire, air, and water,\r\nproduce continual changes, which become very considerable by time. It\r\nis not from general causes alone, whose effects are periodical and\r\nregular, that the sea successively takes the place of the earth, and\r\nforsakes its own dominions. There are a number of particular causes\r\nwhich contribute to these mutations, such as earthquakes, inundations,\r\nsinking of mountains, &c. Thus the most solid thing, at least to our\r\nconception, like the rest of nature, undergoes continual and perpetual\r\nvicissitudes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\nOF THE\r\n\r\n_THEORY OF THE EARTH_.\r\n\r\n\r\nBy the proofs we have given in Articles VII. and VIII. it appears\r\ncertain that the whole of the present dry land was formerly covered\r\nby the sea. It appears also as certain, from Article XII. that the\r\nflux and reflux, and other motions of the ocean, continually detach,\r\nfrom the side and the bottom of the sea, shells and matters of every\r\nkind, some part of which are deposited in other places in form of\r\nsediments, and which are the origin of the parallel and horizontal\r\nstrata every where to be met with. We have proved in Article IX. that\r\nthe inequalities of the globe have been caused by the motion of the\r\nsea, and that mountains have been produced by the successive masses\r\nand heapings of the sediments we have just described. It is evident by\r\nArticle XIII. that the currents, which at first followed the direction\r\nof these inequalities, afterwards gave to them all the figure which\r\nthey at present preserve; that is, that alternate correspondence of\r\nthe saliant angles always opposed to the returning angles. It appears\r\nlikewise by Articles VIII. and XVIII. that the greatest part of the\r\nmatters which the sea has detached from its sides and bottom were, when\r\ndeposited as sediments, in form of a fine impalpable powder, which\r\nperfectly filled the cavities of the shells, whether it was of the same\r\nnature or only analogous to that with which they were composed. It is\r\ncertain, from Article XVII. that the horizontal strata which have been\r\nproduced by the accumulation of sediments, and which at first were in\r\na soft state, acquired hardness in proportion as they became dry, and\r\nthat this drying has produced perpendicular clefts, which cross the\r\nhorizontal strata.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to doubt, after perusing the facts in the Articles\r\nX. XI. XIV. XV. XVI. XVII. XVIII. and XIX. that an infinite number\r\nof revolutions, particular changes and alterations, have happened\r\non the surface of the globe, as well from the natural motion of the\r\nwaters of the sea as by the effects of rain, frost, running waters,\r\nwinds, subterraneous fires, earthquakes, inundations, &c. and that\r\nconsequently the sea has alternately changed places with the earth,\r\nespecially in the earliest times after the creation, when the\r\nterrestrial matters were much softer than they are at present. It must\r\nnevertheless be acknowledged, that we can but very, imperfectly judge\r\nof the succession of natural revolutions; that we can still less judge\r\nof the cause of accidents, changes, and alterations; that the defect\r\nof historical monuments deprives us of the knowledge of particular\r\nfacts, and experience and time is deficient to us. We do not pay any\r\nconsideration that, though the time of our existence is very limited,\r\nnature proceeds in her regular course. We would condense into our\r\nmomentary existence the transactions of ages past and to come, without\r\nreflecting that this instant of time, nay even human life itself, is\r\nonly a single fact in the history of the acts of the Almighty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHISTORY OF ANIMALS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nA COMPARISON BETWEEN ANIMALS, VEGETABLES, AND OTHER PRODUCTIONS OF\r\nNATURE.\r\n\r\n\r\nAmidst the infinite number of objects that offer themselves to our\r\nview, and with which the surface of the earth is every where covered,\r\nAnimals hold the first rank both on account of their formation, and\r\ntheir evident superiority over vegetables and other matters. Animals,\r\nby their senses, form, motion, and many other properties, have a\r\nmore intimate connection with those things which surround them than\r\nvegetables; and the latter, by their figure, growth, and variety of\r\ncomponent parts, have also a nearer relation with external objects,\r\nthan either minerals or stones, which have not any kind of life or\r\nmotion. By this number of properties it is, that the animal claims\r\npre-eminence over the vegetable, and the vegetable over the mineral.\r\nMan, to consider him by his material form alone, is only superior to\r\nthe brute creation by possessing some few peculiar properties, such as\r\nthose given to him by his tongue and hands; and although the works of\r\nthe Creator are in themselves equally perfect, the animal, according to\r\nour mode of perception, is the most complete, and man the most perfect\r\nanimal.\r\n\r\nWhat variety of springs, what forces, and what mechanical motions\r\nare enclosed in this small part of matter which composes the body of\r\nan animal? What properties, what harmony, and what correspondence\r\nbetween the various parts? How many combinations, arrangements, causes,\r\neffects, and principles, conspire to complete one end, and which we\r\nknow only to be results so very difficult to comprehend, that they only\r\ncease from being marvellous by the long custom of not reflecting on\r\nthem?\r\n\r\nNevertheless, however admirable this work appears, it is not the\r\nindividual that is the most wonderful; but it is in the succession,\r\nreproduction, and duration of species, that nature becomes\r\ninconceivable. This faculty of reproduction, which resides alone in\r\nanimals and vegetables; this kind of unity always subsisting, and\r\nseemingly eternal; this procreative power, which perpetually exercises\r\nitself without being destroyed, is a mystery, the depth of which we are\r\nnot enabled to fathom.\r\n\r\nInanimate bodies, even the stones and dirt under our feet, have some\r\nproperties; their existence alone supposes a great number; and the\r\nleast organic matter has an infinity of relations with the other\r\nparts of the universe. We shall not say, with some philosophers, that\r\nmatter, under whatever form it may be, is sensible of its existence and\r\nrelative faculties. This is a metaphysical question, and of which we do\r\nnot here propose to treat, it will be sufficient to observe, that not\r\nhaving a perfect knowledge of our own relation with external objects,\r\nwe cannot doubt that inanimate matters are still more ignorant;\r\nbesides, as our sensations do not in the least resemble the objects\r\nwhich cause them, we must conclude, by analogy, that inanimate matter\r\nhas neither sentiment, sensation, nor a consciousness of its existence;\r\nto attribute any of these faculties to it, would be giving it the\r\npower of thought, action, and perception, nearly in the same manner as\r\nwe think, act, and feel, which is as much repugnant to reason as it is\r\nto religion.\r\n\r\nInanimate bodies being formed of earth and dust, we have, of course,\r\nsome properties in common with them, but they are merely relative to\r\nwhat arises from general matter, such as extent, impenetrability,\r\nweight, &c. but as these properties, purely material, make no\r\nimpression of themselves, as they exist entirely independent, and\r\ndo not at all affect us, we cannot consider them as a part of our\r\nbeing; it is therefore the organization, the soul, and the life, which\r\nconstitute our existence. Matter, considered in this light, is less the\r\nprincipal than the accessor. It is a foreign expansion, the union of\r\nwhich is unknown, and the presence hurtful to us; and thought, which\r\nis the constituent principle of our being, is very probably entirely\r\nindependent.\r\n\r\nWe exist, therefore, without knowing how, and we think without knowing\r\nwhy; but whatever is the manner of our being or thinking, whether our\r\nsensations are true or false, the result of them are not less certain.\r\nThis order of ideas, this train of thoughts, which internally exist\r\nfrom ourselves, although very different from the objects that cause\r\nthem, give rise to the most real affections, and occasion relations\r\nwith external objects, which we may consider as real affinities, since\r\nthey are invariable, and always the same. The human species, therefore,\r\nmay be said to hold the first rank in the order of nature, the brute\r\ncreation the second, vegetables the third, and minerals the last; for\r\nalthough we cannot clearly distinguish between our animal and spiritual\r\nqualities, and although the brute creation are endowed with the same\r\nsenses, possess the same principles of life and motion, and perform\r\na number of actions like man, yet they have not the relation with\r\nexternal objects in the same extensive manner we have, and consequently\r\nthe resemblance must fail in various respects. The distance is greater\r\nbetween man and vegetables, and still more so from minerals, as\r\nvegetables possess a degree of animation, while minerals are destitute\r\nof every principle that tends to organization.\r\n\r\nTo compose, therefore, the history of an animal, we must first nicely\r\ninspect into the general order of his particular relations, and\r\nafterwards distinguish those he has in common with vegetables and\r\nminerals. An animal has nothing in common with a mineral, excepting\r\ngeneral properties of matter; his nature and oeconomy are totally\r\ndifferent: the mineral is a mere senseless and inactive matter, without\r\norganization, faculties, or power of reproduction; a dead mass, fit\r\nonly to be trod under foot by man and animals; even the most precious\r\nmetals are thus considered by the philosopher, as they possess but\r\nan arbitrary value, subordinate to the will, and dependent on the\r\nconvention of men.\r\n\r\nIn an animal all the powers of nature are united; the properties by\r\nwhich it is animated are peculiar to it; by its senses it can will,\r\nact, determine, and communicate with the most distant objects: its body\r\nis a centre, to which every thing is connected; a point where the whole\r\nuniverse is reflected; a world in miniature. These are the properties\r\nwhich peculiarly belong to it; those which it possesses in common with\r\nvegetables are the faculties of growth, expansion, reproduction, and\r\nincrease.\r\n\r\nThe most apparent difference between animals and vegetables seems\r\nto be the faculty of moving from place to place, which animals are\r\nendowed with and vegetables not. It is true we are not acquainted with\r\nany vegetable that has a single progressive motion; and there are\r\nmany kinds of animals, as oysters, &c. to which this motion seems to\r\nhave been denied; the distinction, therefore, is neither general nor\r\nnecessary.\r\n\r\nA more essential difference might be drawn from the faculty of\r\nsensation; but sensation includes such a variety of ideas, that we\r\nought not to mention the word without giving some explication; for if\r\nby sensation we understand only a motion, occasioned by a check or\r\nresistance, we shall find the _sensitive_-plant is also possessed of\r\nit; if, on the contrary, we would have it signify to apprehend and\r\ncompare ideas, we are not certain that brute animals possess it; if\r\nit is allowed to dogs, elephants, &c. whose actions seem to result\r\nfrom the same causes as those of men, it must be denied to an infinite\r\nnumber of others, especially to those which seem to be motionless. If\r\nwe could give to oysters, for example, the same faculty of sensation as\r\nto dogs, though in an inferior degree, why should we not allow it to\r\nvegetables in a still lesser degree? This difference between animals\r\nand vegetables is not, therefore, general, nor well decided.\r\n\r\nA third difference seems to arise from their method of feeding.\r\nAnimals, by the means of certain external organs, seize those things\r\nwhich are agreeable to them: they seek their pasture and chuse their\r\nfood. Plants are reduced to the necessity of receiving such nutriment\r\nas the earth furnishes: they have no diversity in the manner of\r\nprocuring it; no choice in the kind, but the humidity of the earth is\r\ntheir only aliment; nevertheless, if we attend to the organization and\r\naction of roots and leaves, we shall presently discover that there are\r\nin those parts external organs, which vegetables make use of to obtain\r\ntheir food; that the root avoids and turns from an obstacle, or vein\r\nof bad earth, to seek for one that is better; that they divide their\r\nfibres, and even go so far as to change their form to procure nutriment\r\nfor the plant. The difference between animals and vegetables cannot,\r\ntherefore, be established on the manner in which they receive their\r\nnutriment.\r\n\r\nThis investigation induces us to conclude that there is no absolute\r\nessential and general difference between animals and vegetables, but\r\nthat nature descends, by degrees imperceptibly from an animal which is\r\nthe most perfect, to that which is the least, and from the latter to\r\nthe vegetable. The water polypus may therefore be considered as the\r\nline where the animal creation ends and that of plants begin.\r\n\r\nIf, after having examined the distinctions, we search after the\r\nresemblances between animals and vegetables, we shall find the power of\r\nreproduction is general, and very essential to both; a faculty which\r\nwould almost lead us to suppose that animals and vegetables are nearly\r\nof the same order of beings.\r\n\r\nA second resemblance may be drawn from the expansion of their parts,\r\na property which is common to both; for vegetables grow as well as\r\nanimals, and if the manner in which they expand is different, it is not\r\ntotally nor essentially so, since there are very considerable parts\r\nin animals, as the bones, the hair, the nails, the horns, &c. whose\r\nexpansion is a perfect and real vegetation; and the foetus, at its\r\nfirst formation, may be said rather to vegetate than live.\r\n\r\nA third resemblance arises from there being some animals which\r\npropagate like plants, and by the same method. The multiplication of\r\nthe vine-fretter, which is made without copulation, is like that of\r\nplants by seeds; and that of polypuses, by cutting them, resembles the\r\nmultiplication of trees by slips.\r\n\r\nWe can then assert with greater foundation, that animals and vegetables\r\nare beings of the same order, and that nature passes from one to the\r\nother by insensible links; since the properties wherein they resemble\r\neach other are general and essential, and those on which they differ\r\nconfined and particular.\r\n\r\nIf we compare animals and vegetables by other lights, for example, by\r\nnumber, situation, size, form, &c. we shall draw fresh inductions from\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nThe number of the animal species is much greater than that of plants.\r\nIn the class of insects alone there are a greater number of species\r\nthan there are kinds of plants on the surface of the earth. Animals\r\nlikewise much less resemble each other than plants; and it is this\r\nresemblance among the latter which makes the difficulty of knowing and\r\ndiscerning them, and has given rise to so many botanical systems; and\r\nit is for this reason that more labour has been bestowed on that than\r\non zoology.\r\n\r\nBesides, there is another advantage of knowing the species of animals,\r\nand distinguishing them one from another, which is by regarding those\r\nas one and the same species, who, by means of copulation, produce and\r\nperpetuate beings like themselves; and as a different species, those\r\nfrom a connection between whom nothing is produced, or whose product\r\nare unlike their parents. Thus a fox will be a different species from a\r\ndog, if nothing results from a copulation of a male and female of these\r\ntwo animals, and when even there should result a bipartite animal,\r\nor a kind of mule, which cannot generate, that will be sufficient to\r\nestablish the fox and dog of two different species. There is not the\r\nsame advantage to be had in plants, for although some have pretended to\r\ndiscover sexes, and although divisions of breeds have been established\r\nby the parts of fecundation; yet, as these distinctions neither are so\r\ncertain, nor so apparent as in animals, and the production of plants is\r\nmade in many modes, that the sex has no part in, and where the parts of\r\nfecundation are not necessary, this idea cannot be made use of with any\r\nsuccess; it is only on a misapprehended analogy that this sexual method\r\nhas been pretended to distinguish all the different species of plants.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the number of animals is greater than that of plants,\r\nyet that is not the case with respect to the number of individuals\r\nin each species. In animals as well as in plants, the number of\r\nindividuals is much greater in the small species than in the large.\r\nFlies are, perhaps, a million times more numerous than elephants; so\r\nlikewise there are more kinds of plants than trees; but, if we compare\r\nthe quantity of individuals in each species, we shall find that the\r\nplant is more abundant than the animal; for example, quadrupeds bring\r\nforth but a small number of young, and at considerable distances of\r\ntime; trees, on the contrary, produce every year, a great quantity.\r\nIt may be said that this comparison is not exact, and to render it\r\nso, we should compare the quantity of seeds produced by a tree, with\r\na quantity of germs contained in the semen of an animal, and then,\r\nperhaps, we should find, that animals are still more abundant in their\r\nseed than vegetables. But it should be considered that it is possible\r\nby collecting and sowing all the seeds of an elm, for instance, that\r\nwe might have 100,000 young ones from the product of a single year;\r\nand that should we supply a horse with as many mares as he could cover\r\nin one year, there would be a great difference between the production\r\nof the animal and that of the vegetable. I shall not examine into the\r\nquantity of germs; first, because we are not acquainted with it in\r\nthe animal creation: and secondly, because possibly there is the same\r\nnumber of seminal shoots in the vegetable: for the seed of a vegetable\r\nis not a germ, being as perfect a production as the foetus of an\r\nanimal, and to which, like that, a greater expansion is only wanting.\r\n\r\nTo my comparison may likewise be opposed the prodigious multiplication\r\nof certain kinds of insects: as the bee in particular, one of which\r\nwill produce thirty or forty thousand. But it must be observed, that I\r\nspeak in general of animals compared with vegetables; and besides, this\r\nexample of bees, which perhaps is the greatest multiplication among\r\nanimals, does not constitute a proof against what we have observed; for\r\nof thirty or forty thousand flies produced by the female bee, there is\r\nbut few females; fifteen hundred, or two thousand males, and all the\r\nrest moles, or rather neutral flies, without sex, and incapable of\r\nprocreating.\r\n\r\nIt must be owned, that in insects, fish, and shell-fish, there are\r\nspecies which seem to be very abundant; oysters, herrings, fleas,\r\nbeetles, &c. are perhaps in as great numbers as mosses and the most\r\ncommon plants; but on the whole, the greatest number of the animal\r\nspecies is less abundant than the vegetable; and by comparing different\r\nkinds of plants with each other, there is not found such great\r\ndifferences in the number, as in the animal species; some of which\r\nbring forth a prodigious number, and others only a few; whereas the\r\nnumber of productions in plants is always very great throughout.\r\n\r\nBy what we have observed, it appears that the smallest and basest\r\nspecies seem to be the most prolific: the most minute are the most\r\nplentiful as well in animals as in plants, and in proportion as\r\nthe animals are more perfect, they appear to decrease in number of\r\nindividuals. Can it be thought, that certain forms of the body,\r\nas those of quadrupeds and birds, requisite for the perfection of\r\nsensation, would cost nature more organic particles than the production\r\nof less important animals?\r\n\r\nLet us now pass to the comparison of animals and vegetables, with\r\nrespect to situation, form, and size. The earth is the only place\r\nwherein vegetables can subsist. The greatest number grow above the\r\nsurface, and are attached to the soil by roots. Some, as truffles,\r\nare entirely covered with earth, and a few grow under the water, but\r\nall require the surface of the earth to exist upon. Animals, on the\r\ncontrary, are more generally dispersed; some dwell on the surface, and\r\nothers in the bowels of the earth; some live at the bottom, and others\r\nswim in the waters of the ocean: some exist in the air, others dwell in\r\nthe internal parts of plants, on the bodies of men and other animals,\r\nliquors, and even stones are not without them.\r\n\r\nBy the use of the microscope, a great number of new species of animals\r\nhave been discovered: but singular as it may appear, we have not\r\nfound more than one or two new species of plants by the help of this\r\ninstrument. The small moss is, perhaps, the only microscopical plant\r\nspoken of; and we might, therefore, imagine that nature refused to\r\nproduce very small plants, while she formed animalcules with profusion;\r\nbut we might deceive ourselves by adopting this opinion without\r\nexamination, and our error might arise from plants, in fact, resembling\r\neach other more than animals; so that this moldiness, which we only\r\ntake for a very minute moss, may possibly be a kind of forest or\r\ngarden, filled with abundance of various plants, although we are unable\r\nto mark the difference.\r\n\r\nBy comparing the size of animals and plants there will be found a great\r\ninequality, for the distance is much greater between the size of a\r\nwhale and one of these microscope animals, than between the highest oak\r\nand the moss we are now speaking of. Although bulk be only a relative\r\nattribute, it may, nevertheless, be useful to inspect into the extreme\r\nboundaries nature has allotted to her productions. In bigness animals\r\nand plants seem to have a near equality; a large whale and a large tree\r\nforms a volume not very different; whereas, among the small it has been\r\nasserted there are animals so very minute that a million of them united\r\ntogether, would not equal, in size, the smallest moss-plant ever seen.\r\n\r\nThe most general and most sensible difference between animals and\r\nvegetables is that of figure, for the form of animals, although\r\ninfinitely varied, has not any resemblance to that of plants; and\r\nalthough the polypus will, like plants, reproduce by cutting, and may\r\nbe regarded as the link between the animal and vegetable kingdoms,\r\nnot only by the mode of their reproduction but also by their external\r\nform, nevertheless the figure of the animal is so different from the\r\nexternal form of a plant that it is difficult to be deceived therein.\r\nSome animals form things resembling plants or flowers, but plants never\r\nproduce any thing like an animal; and those admirable insects which\r\nproduce and form the coral, would not have been taken for flowers if\r\ncoral had not been regarded as a plant. Thus the errors wherein we\r\nmight fall, by comparing plants with animals, will never have any\r\ninfluence but on a few objects which compose the link between both, and\r\nthe more observations we shall make the more we shall be convinced that\r\nthe Creator has not placed a fixed line between animals and vegetables;\r\nthat these two species of organized beings have many more common\r\nproperties than real differences; that the production of an animal does\r\nnot require of nature more, and possibly, less exertion than that of\r\na vegetable; that in general the production of organized beings does\r\nnot require exertion, and that, in short, the living animated nature,\r\ninstead of composing a metaphysical degree of beings, is a physical\r\nproperty, common to all matter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nOR [BH]REPRODUCTION IN GENERAL.\r\n\r\n[BH] This word is used by the author in an enlarged sense of\r\npropagation, for as generation applies to animated beings, so by this\r\nhe includes the vegetable as well as animal system.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe shall now make a more minute inspection into this common property of\r\nanimal and vegetable nature; this power of producing its resemblance;\r\nthis chain of successive individuals, which constitutes the real\r\nexistence of the species; and without attaching ourselves to the\r\ngeneration of man, or to that of any particular kind of animal, let\r\nus inspect the phenomenas of reproduction in general, let us collect\r\nfacts, and enumerate the different methods nature makes use of to renew\r\norganized beings. The first, and as we think the most simple method,\r\nis, to collect in one body an infinite number of resembling organic\r\nbodies, and so to compose its substance, that there is not a part\r\nof it which does not contain a germ of the same species, and which\r\nconsequently of itself might become a whole, resembling that of which\r\nit constitutes a part. This preparation seems to suppose a prodigious\r\nwaste, and to carry with it profusion; yet it is a very common\r\nmunificence of nature, and which manifests itself even in the most\r\ncommon and inferior kinds, such as worms, polypuses, elms, willows,\r\ngooseberry-trees, and many other plants and insects, each part of which\r\ncontains a whole, and by the single effect of expansion alone may\r\nbecome a plant, or an insect. By considering organized beings in this\r\npoint of view, an individual is a whole, uniformly organized in all\r\nits parts; a compound of an infinity of resembling figures and similar\r\nparts, an assemblage of germs, or small individuals of the same kind,\r\nwhich can expand in the same mode according to circumstances, and form\r\nnew bodies, composed like those from whence they proceed.\r\n\r\nBy examining this idea thoroughly, we shall discover a connection\r\nbetween animals, vegetables, and minerals, which we could not expect.\r\nSalts, and some other minerals, are composed of parts resembling each\r\nother, and to all that composes them; a grain of salt is a cube,\r\ncomposed of an infinity of smaller cubes, which we may easily perceive\r\nby a microscope; these are also composed of other cubes still smaller,\r\nas may be perceived with a better microscope; and we cannot doubt,\r\nbut that the primitive and constituting particles of this salt are\r\nlikewise cubes so exceedingly minute as to escape our sight, and our\r\nimagination. Animals and plants which can multiply by all their parts,\r\nare organized bodies, of which the primitive and constituting parts are\r\nalso organic and similar, of which we discern the aggregate quantity,\r\nbut cannot perceive the primitive parts only by reason and analogy.\r\n\r\nThis leads us to believe that there is an infinity of organic particles\r\nactually existing and living in nature, the substance of which is the\r\nsame with that of organized bodies. As we have just observed, in a\r\nstructure of a similar kind, though of inanimate matter, that it was\r\ncomposed of an infinity of particles which have a perfect semblance to\r\nthe whole body, and as there must perhaps be millions of small cubes of\r\naccumulated salts to form a sensible individual grain of sea-salt, so\r\nlikewise millions of organic particles, like the whole, are required\r\nto form one out of that multiplicity of germs contained in an elm, or\r\na polypus; and as we must separate, bruise, and dissolve a cube of\r\nsea-salt to perceive, by means of crystallization, the small cubes of\r\nwhich it is composed; we must likewise separate the parts of an elm or\r\npolypus to discover, by means of vegetation and expansion, the small\r\nelms or polypuses contained in those parts.\r\n\r\nThe difficulty of giving way to this idea arises from a prejudice\r\nstrongly established, that there is no method of judging of the\r\ncomplex, except by the simple, and that, to conceive the organic\r\nconstitution of a body we must reduce it to its simple and unorganized\r\nparts, and that it is more easy to conceive how a cube is composed\r\nof other cubes than how one polypus is composed of others; but if we\r\nattentively examine what is meant by simple and complex, we shall then\r\nfind that in this, as in every thing else, the plan of nature is quite\r\ndifferent from the very rough draught of it formed by our ideas.\r\n\r\nOur senses, as is well known, do not furnish us with exact\r\nrepresentations of external objects, insomuch that if we are desirous\r\nof estimating, judging, comparing, measuring, &c. we are obliged to\r\nhave recourse to foreign assistance, to rules, principles, instruments,\r\n&c. All these helps are the works of human knowledge, and partake more\r\nor less of the abstraction of our ideas; this abstraction, therefore,\r\nis what is called the simple, and the difficulty of reducing them to\r\nthis abstraction, the complex. Extent, for example, being a general and\r\nabstracted property from nature, is not very complex; nevertheless,\r\nto form a judgment of it, we have supposed extents without depth,\r\nwithout breadth, and even points without any extent at all. All these\r\nabstractions have been invented for the support of our judgment, and\r\nthe few definitions made use of in geometry have occasioned a variety\r\nof prejudices and false conclusions. All that can be reduced by these\r\ndefinitions are termed _simple_, and all that cannot be readily reduced\r\nare called _complex_; from hence a triangle, a square, a circle, a\r\ncube, &c. are simple subjects, as well as all curves, whose geometrical\r\nlaws we are acquainted with; but all that we cannot reduce by these\r\nabstracted figures and laws are complex. We do not consider that these\r\ngeometrical figures exist only in our imagination; that they are not\r\nto be found in nature, or, at least, if they are discoverable there,\r\nit is because she exhibits every possible form, and that it is more\r\ndifficult and rare to find simple figures of an equilateral pyramid,\r\nor an exact cube in nature, than compounded forms of a plant or an\r\nanimal. In everything, therefore, we take the abstract for the simple,\r\nand the real for the complex. In Nature, on the contrary, the abstract\r\nhas no existence, every thing is compounded; we shall never, of course,\r\npenetrate into the intimate structure of bodies: we cannot, therefore,\r\npronounce on what is complex in a greater or lesser degree, excepting\r\nby the greater or lesser each subject has to ourselves and to the rest\r\nof the universe; from which reason it is we judge that the animal is\r\nmore compounded than the vegetable, and the vegetable more than the\r\nmineral. This notion is just with relation to us, but we know not, in\r\nreality, whether the animal, vegetable, or mineral, is the most simple\r\nor complex; and we are ignorant whether a globule, or a cube, is more\r\nindebted for an exertion of nature, than a seed or an organic particle.\r\nIf we would form conjectures on this subject, we might suppose that the\r\nmost common and numerous things are the most simple but then animals\r\nwould be the most simple, since the number of their kind far exceeds\r\nthat of plants or minerals.\r\n\r\nBut without taking up more time on this discussion, it is sufficient\r\nto have shewn that the opinions we commonly have of the simple and\r\ncomplex are ideas of abstraction, that they cannot be applied to the\r\ncompound productions of nature, and that when we attempt to reduce\r\nevery being to elements of a regular figure, or to prismatic, cubical,\r\nor globular particles, we substitute our own imaginations in the place\r\nof realities; that the forms of the constituting particles of different\r\nbodies are absolutely unknown to us, and that, consequently, we can\r\nsuppose, that an organized body is composed of organic particles, as\r\nwell as that a cube is composed of other cubes.\r\n\r\nWe have no other rule to judge by than experience. We perceive that a\r\ncube of sea-salt is composed of other cubes, and that an elm consists\r\nof other smaller elms, because, by taking an end of a branch, or root,\r\nor a piece of the wood separated from the trunk, or a seed, they will\r\nalike produce a new tree. It is the same with respect to polypuses,\r\nand some other kinds of animals, which we can multiply by cutting off,\r\nand separating any of the different parts;[BI] and since our rule for\r\njudging in both is the same, why should we judge differently of them?\r\n\r\n[BI] See Supplement to this Work, containing History of Birds, Fish,\r\nInsects, &c. vol. V. p. 377.\r\n\r\nIt therefore appears very probable, by the above reasons, that there\r\nreally exists in nature a number of small organized beings, alike, in\r\nevery respect, to the large organized bodies seen in the world; that\r\nthese small organized beings are composed of living organic particles,\r\nwhich are common to animals and vegetables, and are their primitive and\r\nincompatible particles, that the assemblage of these particles form an\r\nanimal or plant, and consequently that reproduction, or generation, is\r\nonly a change of form made by the addition of these resembling parts\r\nalone, and that death or dissolution is nothing more than a separation\r\nof the same particles. Of the truth of this we apprehend there will not\r\nremain a doubt, after reading the proofs we shall give in the following\r\nchapters. Besides, if we reflect on the manner in which trees grow,\r\nand consider how so considerable a volume can arise from so small an\r\norigin, we shall be convinced that it proceeds from the simple addition\r\nof small resembling organized particles. A grain produces a young tree,\r\nwhich it contained in miniature. At the summit of this small tree a bud\r\nis formed, which contains the young tree for the succeeding year, and\r\nthis bud is an organic part, resembling the young tree of the first\r\nyear's growth. A similar bud appears the second year, containing a tree\r\nfor the third; and thus, successively, as long as the tree continues\r\ngrowing, at the extremity of each branch new buds will form, containing\r\nyoung trees like that of the first year. Thus it is evident, that trees\r\nare composed of small organized bodies, similar to themselves, and\r\nthat the whole individual is formed by the union of small resembling\r\nindividuals.\r\n\r\nBut, it may be asked, were not all these organized bodies contained\r\nin the seed, and may not the order of their expansion be traced from\r\nthat source, for the bud which first appeared was evidently surmounted\r\nby another similar bud, which was not expanded till the second year,\r\nand soon to the third; and consequently the seed may be said really\r\nto contain all the buds, or young trees that would be produced for a\r\nhundred years, or till the dissolution of the tree itself? This seed it\r\nis also plain not only contained all the small organized bodies which\r\none day must constitute the individual tree, but also every seed, every\r\nindividual, and every succession of seeds and individuals, to the total\r\ndestruction of the species.\r\n\r\nThis is the principal difficulty, and we shall examine it with the\r\nstrictest attention. It is certain that the seed produces by the single\r\nexpansion of the bud, or germ, it contains, a young tree the first\r\nyear, and that this tree existed in miniature in that bud, but it is\r\nnot equally certain that the bud of the second year, and those of the\r\nsucceeding, were all contained in the first seed, no more than that\r\nevery organized body and seed, which must succeed to the end of the\r\nworld, or to the destruction of the species, were so. This opinion\r\nsupposes a progress to infinity, and forms, of each individual, a\r\nsource of eternal generations. The first seed, in that case, must have\r\ncontained every plant of its kind which have existed or ever will\r\nexist; and the first man must actually and individually have contained\r\nin his loins every man which has or will appear on the face of the\r\nearth. Each seed, and each animal, agreeable to this opinion, must\r\nhave possessed within an infinite posterity. But the more we suffer\r\nourselves to wander into these kind of reasonings, the more we lose the\r\nsight of truth in the labyrinth of infinity; and instead of clearing up\r\nand solving the question, we confuse and involve it in more obscurity;\r\nit is placing the object out of sight, and afterwards saying it is\r\nimpossible to see it.\r\n\r\nLet us investigate a little these ideas of infinite progression and\r\nexpansion. From whence do they arise? What do they represent? The ideas\r\nof infinity can only spring from an idea of that which is limited, for\r\nit is in that manner we have an idea of an infinity of succession, a\r\ngeometrical infinity: each individual is an unit, many individuals\r\ncompose a finite number, and the whole species is the infinite\r\nmultitude. Thus in the same manner as a geometrical infinity may be\r\ndemonstrated not to exist, so we may be assured that an infinite\r\nprogression or expansion does not exist; that it is only an abstract\r\nidea, a retrenchment of the idea of finity, of which we take away the\r\nlimits that necessarily terminate all size; and that, of course, we\r\nmust reject from philosophy every opinion which leads to an idea of the\r\nactual existence of geometrical or arithmetical infinity.\r\n\r\nThe partizans, therefore, of this opinion must acknowledge, that\r\ntheir infinity of succession and multiplication is, in fact, only an\r\nindeterminate or indefinite number; a number greater than any we can\r\nhave an idea of, but which is not infinite. This being granted, they\r\nwill tell us, that the first seed of an elm, for example, which does\r\nnot weigh a grain, really contains all the organic particles necessary\r\nfor the formation of this, and every other tree of the same kind which\r\never shall appear. But what do they explain to us by this answer? Is it\r\nnot cutting the knot instead of untying it, and eluding the question\r\nwhen it should be resolved.\r\n\r\nWhen we ask how beings are multiplied? and it is answered that this\r\nmultiplication was compleatly made in the first body, is it not\r\nacknowledging that they are ignorant how it is made, and renouncing\r\nthe will of conceiving it? The question is asked, how one body produces\r\nits like? and it is answered, that the whole was created at once.\r\nCan we receive this as a solution? for whether one or a million of\r\ngenerations have passed the like difficulty remains, and so far from\r\nexplaining the supposition of an indefinite number of germs, increases\r\nthe obscurity, and renders it incomprehensible.\r\n\r\nI own, that in this circumstance, it is easier to start objections\r\nthan to establish probabilities, and that the question of reproduction\r\nis of such subtle nature, as possibly never to be fully resolved; but\r\nthen we should search whether it is totally inscrutable, and by that\r\nexamination, we shall discover all that is possible to be known of the\r\nsubject; or at least, why we must remain ignorant of it.\r\n\r\nThere are two kinds of questions, some belonging to the first causes,\r\nthe others have only particular effects; for example, if it is\r\nasked, why matter is impenetrable? it must either remain unanswered,\r\nor be replied to by saying, matter is impenetrable, because it is\r\nimpenetrable. It will be the same with respect to all the general\r\nqualities of matter, whether relative to gravity, extension, motion\r\nor rest; no other reply can be given, and we shall not be surprised\r\nthat such is the case, if we attentively consider, that in order to\r\ngive a reason for a thing, we must have a different subject from which\r\nwe may deduce a comparison, and therefore if the reason of a general\r\ncause is asked, that is, of a quality which belongs to all in general,\r\nand of which we have no subject to which it does not belong, we are\r\nconsequently unable to reason upon it; from thence it is demonstrable,\r\nit would be useless to make such enquiries, since we should go against\r\nthe supposition that quality is general and universal.\r\n\r\nIf, on the contrary, the reason of a particular effect depends\r\nimmediately on one of the general causes above mentioned, and whether\r\nit partakes of the general effect immediately, or by a chain of other\r\neffects, the question will be equally solved, provided we distinctly\r\nperceive the dependence these effects have on each other, and the\r\nconnections there are between them.\r\n\r\nBut if the particular effect, of which we enquire the reason, does not\r\nappear to depend on these general effects, nor to have any analogy\r\nwith other known effects, then this effect, being the only one of its\r\nkind, and having nothing in common with other effects, at least known\r\nto us, the question is insolvable: because, not having, in this point,\r\nany known subject which has any connection with that we would explain,\r\nthere is nothing from whence we can draw the reason sought after.\r\nWhen the reason of a general cause is demanded, it is unanswerable,\r\nbecause it exists in every object; and, on the other hand, the reason\r\nof a singular or isolated effect is not found, because not any thing\r\nknown has the same qualities. We cannot explain the reason of a general\r\neffect, without discovering one more general; whereas the reason of\r\nan isolated effect may be explained by the discovery of some other\r\nrelative effect, which although we are ignorant of at present, chance\r\nor experience may bring to light.\r\n\r\nBesides these, there is another kind of question, which may be called,\r\nthe question of fact. For example. Why do trees, dogs, &c. exist?\r\nAll these fact questions are totally insoluble, for those who answer\r\nthem by final causes do not consider that they take the effect for\r\nthe cause; the connection particular objects have with us having no\r\ninfluence on their origin. Moral affinity can never become a physical\r\nreason.\r\n\r\nWe must carefully distinguish these questions where the _why_ is used,\r\nfrom those where the _how_ is employed, and more so from those where\r\nthe _how many_ is mentioned. _Why_ is always relative to the cause of\r\nthe effect, or to the effect itself. _How_ is relative to the mode from\r\nwhich the effect springs, and the _how many_ has relation only to the\r\nproportionate quantity of the effect.\r\n\r\nAll these distinctions being explained, let us proceed to examine the\r\nquestion concerning the reproduction of bodies. If it is asked, why\r\nanimals and vegetables reproduce? we shall clearly discover, that this\r\nbeing a question of fact, it is insolvable, and useless to endeavour at\r\nthe solution of it. But if it is asked, _how_ animals and vegetables\r\nreproduce; we reply by relating the history of the generation of every\r\nspecies of animal, and of the reproduction of each distinct vegetable;\r\nbut, after having run over all the methods of an animal engendering\r\nits resemblance, accompanied even with the most exact observations, we\r\nshall find it has only taught us facts without indicating causes; and\r\nthat the apparent methods which Nature makes use of for reproduction,\r\ndo not appear to have any connection with the effects resulting\r\ntherefrom; we shall be still obliged to ask, what is the secret mode by\r\nwhich she enables different bodies to propagate their own species?\r\n\r\nThis question is very different from the first and second; it gives\r\nliberty of enquiry and admits the employment of imagination, and\r\ntherefore is not insolvable, for it does not immediately belong to a\r\ngeneral cause; nor is it entirely a question of fact, for provided we\r\ncan conceive a mode of reproduction dependent upon, or not repugnant\r\nto, original causes, we shall have gained a satisfactory answer; and\r\nthe more it shall have a connection with other effects of nature, the\r\nbetter foundation will it be raised upon.\r\n\r\nBy the question itself it is, therefore, permitted to form hypotheses,\r\nand to select that which shall appear to have the greatest analogy with\r\nthe other phenomena of nature. But we must exclude from the number\r\nall those which supposes the thing already done; for example, such\r\nas suppose that all the germs of the same species were contained in\r\nthe first seed, or that every reproduction is a new creation, and\r\nimmediate effect of the Almighty's will; because these hypotheses are\r\nquestions of fact, and on which it is impossible to reason. We must\r\nalso reject every hypothesis which might have final causes for its\r\nobject; such as, we might say, that reproduction is made in order for\r\nthe living to supply the place of the dead, that the earth may be\r\nalways covered with vegetables, and peopled with animals; that man may\r\nfind plenty for his subsistence, &c. because these hypotheses, instead\r\nof explaining the effects by physical causes, are founded only on\r\narbitrary connections and moral agreements. At the same time we must\r\nnot rely on these absolute axioms and physical problems, which so many\r\npeople have improperly made use of, as principles; for example, there\r\nis no fecundation made apart from the body, _nulla foecondatio extra\r\ncorpus_; every living thing is produced from an egg; all generation\r\nsupposes sexes, &c. We must not take these maxims in an absolute sense,\r\nbut consider them only as signifying things generally performed in one\r\nparticular mode rather than in any other.\r\n\r\nLet us, therefore, search after an hypothesis which has not any\r\nof those defects, and by which we cannot fall into any of these\r\ninconveniences; if, then, we do not succeed in the explanation of the\r\nmechanical power Nature makes use of to effect the reproduction of\r\nbeings, we shall, at least, arrive at something more probable than what\r\nhas hitherto been advanced.\r\n\r\nAs we can make moulds, by which we can give to the external parts of\r\nbodies whatever figure we please, let us suppose Nature can form the\r\nsame, by which she not only bestows on bodies the external figure but\r\nalso the internal. Would not this be one mode by which reproduction may\r\nbe performed?\r\n\r\nLet us, then, consider on what foundation this supposition is raised:\r\nlet us examine if it contains any thing contradictory, and afterwards\r\nwe shall discover what consequences may be derived from it. Though our\r\nsenses are only judges of the external parts of bodies, we perfectly\r\ncomprehend external affection and different figures. We can also\r\nimitate Nature, by representing external figures by different modes, as\r\nby painting, sculpture, and moulds; but although our senses are only\r\njudges of external qualities, we know there are internal qualities,\r\nsome of which are general, as gravity. This quality, or power, does\r\nnot act relatively to surfaces, but proportionably to the masses, or\r\nquantities of matter; there is, therefore, very active qualities in\r\nNature, which even penetrate bodies to the most internal parts; but we\r\nshall never gain a perfect idea of these qualities, because, not being\r\nexternal, they cannot fall within the compass of our senses; but we can\r\ncompare their effects, and deduce analogies therefrom, to answer for\r\nthe effect of similar qualities.\r\n\r\nIf our eyes, instead of representing to us the surface of objects only,\r\nwere so formed as to shew us the internal parts alone, we should then\r\nhave clear ideas of the latter, without the smallest knowledge of the\r\nformer. In this supposition the internal moulds, which I have supposed\r\nto be made use of by Nature, might be as easily seen and conceived as\r\nthe moulds for external figures. In that case we should have modes of\r\nimitating the internal parts of bodies as we now have for the external.\r\nThese internal moulds, although we cannot acquire, Nature may be\r\npossessed of, as she is of the qualities of gravity, which penetrate\r\nto the internal particles of matter. The supposition of these moulds\r\nbeing formed on good analogies it only remains for us to examine if it\r\nincludes any contradiction.\r\n\r\nIt may be argued that the expression of _an internal mould_ includes\r\ntwo contradictory ideas; that the idea of a mould can only be related\r\nto the surface, and that the internal, according to this, must have a\r\nconnection with the whole mass, and, therefore, it might as well be\r\ncalled a massive surface as an internal mould.\r\n\r\nI admit, that when we are about to represent ideas which have not\r\nhitherto been expressed, we are obliged to make use of terms which seem\r\ncontradictory; for this reason philosophers have often employed foreign\r\nterms on such occasions, instead of applying those in common use, and\r\nwhich have a received signification; but this artifice is useless,\r\nsince we can shew the opposition is only in the words, and that there\r\nis nothing contradictory in the idea. Now I affirm that a simple idea\r\ncannot contain a contradiction, that is, when we can form an idea of\r\na thing; if this idea is simple it cannot be compounded; it cannot\r\ninclude any other idea, and, consequently, it will contain nothing\r\nopposite nor contrary.\r\n\r\nSimple ideas are not only the primary apprehensions which strike\r\nus by the senses, but also the primary comparisons which form from\r\nthose apprehensions; for the first apprehension, itself is always a\r\ncomparison. The idea of the size of an object, or of its remoteness,\r\nnecessarily includes a comparison with bulk or distance in general;\r\ntherefore, when an idea only includes comparison it must be regarded\r\nas simple, and from that circumstance, as containing nothing\r\ncontradictory. Such is the idea of the internal mould. There is a\r\nquality in Nature, called _gravity_, which penetrates the internal\r\nparts of bodies. I take the idea of internal mould relatively to this\r\nquality, and, therefore, including only comparison, it bears not any\r\ncontradiction.\r\n\r\nLet us now see the consequences that may be deduced from this\r\nsupposition; let us also search after facts corresponding therewith, as\r\nit will become so much the more probable, as the number of analogies\r\nshall be greater. Let us begin by unfolding this idea of internal\r\nmoulds, and by explaining in what manner we understand it, we shall be\r\nbrought to conceive the modes of reproduction.\r\n\r\nNature, in general, seems to have a greater tendency to life than\r\ndeath, and to organize bodies as much as possible; the multiplication\r\nof germs, which may be infinitely encreased, is a proof of it; and\r\nwe may assert with safety, that if all matter is not organized, it\r\nis because organized beings destroy each other; or we can augment as\r\nmuch as we please the quantity of living and vegetating beings, but we\r\ncannot augment the quantity of stones or other inanimate matters. This\r\nseems to indicate that the most common work of Nature is the production\r\nof the organic part, and in which her power knows no bounds.\r\n\r\nTo render this intelligible, let us make a calculation of what a\r\nsingle germ might produce. The seed of an elm, which does not weigh\r\nthe hundredth part of an ounce, at the end of 100 years will produce a\r\ntree whose volume will be 60 cubic feet. At the tenth year this tree\r\nwill have produced 1000 seeds, which being all sown, at the end of 100\r\nyears would each have also a volume equal to 60 cubic feet. Thus in\r\n110 years there is produced more than 60,000 cubic feet of organized\r\nmatter; 10 years more there will be 10,000,000 of fathoms, without\r\nincluding the 10,000 encreased every year, which would make 100,000\r\nmore; and ten years after there will be three times that number; thus\r\nin 130 years a single shoot will produce a volume of organized matter,\r\nwhich would fill up a space of 1000 cubic leagues; 10 years after it\r\nwould comprehend a 1,000,000, and in 10 years more 1,000,000 times\r\n1,000,000 cubic leagues; so that in 150 years the whole terrestrial\r\nglobe might be entirely converted into one single kind of organized\r\nmatter. In this production of organized body Nature would know no\r\nbounds, if it were not for the resistance of matters which are not\r\nsusceptible of organization, and this proves that she does not incline\r\nto form inanimate but organized beings, and that in this she never\r\nstops but when irresistible inconveniences are opposed thereto. What\r\nwe have already said on the seed of an elm may be said of any other;\r\nand it would be easy to demonstrate, that if we were to hatch every egg\r\nproduced by hens for the space of 30 years, there would be a sufficient\r\nnumber of fowls to cover the whole surface of the earth.\r\n\r\nThese kind of calculations demonstrate that organic formation is the\r\nmost common work of Nature, and, apparently, that which costs her\r\nthe least labour. But I will go farther; the general division which\r\nwe ought to make of matter seems to me to be in _living_ and _dead\r\nmatter_, instead of organized and brute; the brute is only that matter\r\nproduced by the death of animals or vegetables; I could prove it by\r\nthat enormous quantity of shells, and other cast-off matters of living\r\nanimals, which compose the principal part of stones, marble, chalk,\r\nmarle, earth, turf, and other substances, which we call brute matter,\r\nand which are only the ruins of dead animals or vegetables; but a\r\nreflection, which seems to me well founded, will, perhaps, make it\r\nbetter understood.\r\n\r\nHaving meditated on the activity of Nature to produce organized bodies,\r\nand seen that her power, in this respect, is not limited; having\r\nproved that infinity of organic living particles, which constitute\r\nlife, must exist; having shewn that the living body costs the least\r\ntrouble to Nature, I now search after the principal causes of death and\r\ndestruction, and I find that bodies in general, which have the power\r\nof converting matter into their proper substance, and to assimilate\r\nthe parts of other bodies, are the greatest destroyers. Fire, for\r\nexample, turns into its own substance almost every species of matter,\r\nand is the greatest means of destruction known to us. Animals seem to\r\nparticipate of the qualities of flame; their internal heat is a kind of\r\nfire; therefore, after fire, animals are the greatest destroyers, and\r\nthey assimilate and convert into their own substance every matter which\r\nmay serve them for food: but although these two causes of destruction\r\nare very considerable, and their effects perpetually incline to\r\nthe annihilation of organized beings, the cause of reproduction is\r\ninfinitely more powerful and active; she seems to borrow, even from\r\ndestruction itself, means to multiply, since assimilation, which is one\r\ncause of death, is at the same time a necessary means of producing life.\r\n\r\nTo destroy an organized being is, as we have observed, only to separate\r\nthe organic particles of which it is composed; these particles remain\r\nseparated till they are re-united by some active power. But what is\r\nthis active power?--It is the power which animals and vegetables have\r\nto assimilate the matter that serves them for food; and is not this\r\nthe same, or at least has it not great connection with that which is\r\nthe cause of reproduction?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nOF NUTRITION AND GROWTH.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe body of an animal is a kind of internal mould, in which the\r\nnutritive matter assimilates itself with the whole in such a manner\r\nthat, without changing the order and proportion of the parts, each\r\nreceives an augmentation, and it is this augmentation of bulk which\r\nsome have called _expansion_, because they imagined every difficulty\r\nwould be removed by the supposition that the animal was completely\r\nformed in the embryo, and that it would be easy to conceive that its\r\nparts would expand, or unfold in proportion as it would increase by the\r\naddition of accessory matter.\r\n\r\nBut if we would have a clear idea of this augmentation and expansion,\r\nhow can it be done otherwise than by considering the animal body,\r\nand each of its parts, as so many internal moulds which receive the\r\naccessory matter in the order that results from the position of all\r\ntheir parts? This expansion cannot be made by the addition to the\r\nsurfaces alone, but, on the contrary, by an intimate susception which\r\npenetrates the mass, and thus increases the size of the parts, without\r\nchanging the form, from whence it is necessary that the matter which\r\nserves for this expansion should penetrate the internal part in all\r\nits dimensions; it is also as necessary that this penetration be made\r\nin a certain order and proportion, so that no one point can receive\r\nmore than another, without which some parts would expand quicker than\r\nothers, and the form be entirely changed. Now what can prescribe this\r\nrule to accessory matter, and constrain it to arrive perpetually and\r\nproportionally to every point of the internal parts, except we conceive\r\nan internal mould?\r\n\r\nIt therefore appears certain that the body of an animal or vegetable\r\nis an internal mould of a constant form, but where their masses may\r\naugment proportionably, by the extension of this mould in all its\r\nexternal and internal dimensions. That this extension also is made\r\nby the intus-susception of any accessory or foreign matter which\r\npenetrates the internal part, and becomes similar to the form and\r\nidentical substance with the matter of the moulds themselves.\r\n\r\nBut of what nature is this matter which the animal or vegetable\r\nassimilates with its own substance? what can be the nature of that\r\npower which gives it the activity and necessary motion to penetrate the\r\ninternal mould? and if such a power does exist, must it not be similar\r\nto that by which the internal mould itself would be produced?\r\n\r\nThese three questions include all that can be desired on this subject,\r\nand seem to depend on each other so much, that I am persuaded the\r\nreproduction of an animal or vegetable cannot be explained in a\r\nsatisfactory manner, if a clear idea of the mode of the operation of\r\nnutrition is not obtained; we must, therefore, examine these three\r\nquestions separately, in order to compare the consequences resulting\r\ntherefrom.\r\n\r\nThe first, which relates to the nutritive nature of this matter, is\r\nin part resolved by the reasons we have already given, and will be\r\nfully demonstrated in the succeeding chapter. We will shew that there\r\nexists an infinity of living organic particles in Nature; that their\r\nproduction is of little expence to Nature, since their existence is\r\nconstant and invariable, and that the causes of death only separate\r\nwithout destroying them. Therefore the matter which the animal or\r\nvegetable assimilates is an organic matter of the same nature as the\r\nanimal or vegetable itself, and which consequently can augment the\r\nsize without changing the form or quality of the matter of the mould,\r\nsince it is in fact of the same form and quality as that which it is\r\nconstituted with. Thus, in the quantity of aliments which the animal\r\ntakes to support life, and to keep its organs in play, and in the sap,\r\nwhich the vegetable takes up by its roots and leaves, there is a great\r\npart thrown off by transpiration, secretion, and other excretory modes,\r\nand only a small portion retained for the nourishment of the parts and\r\ntheir expansion. It is very probable, that in the body of an animal\r\nor vegetable there is formed a separation of the brute particles of\r\nthe aliments and the organic; that the first are carried off by the\r\ncauses just mentioned; that only organic particles remain, and that\r\nthe distribution of them is made by means of some active power which\r\nconducts them to every part in an exact proportion, insomuch that\r\nneither receive more or less than is needful for its equal nutrition,\r\ngrowth, or expansion.\r\n\r\nThe second question, What can be the active power which causes this\r\norganic matter to penetrate and incorporate itself with this internal\r\nmould? By the preceding chapter it appears, that there exists in\r\nNature powers relative to the internal part of matter, and which have\r\nno relation with its external qualities. These powers, as already\r\nobserved, will never come under our cognizance, because their action is\r\nmade on the internal part of the body, whereas our senses cannot reach\r\nbeyond what is external; it is therefore evident, that we shall never\r\nhave a clear idea of the penetrating powers, nor of the manner by which\r\nthey act; but it is not less certain that they exist, than that by\r\ntheir means most effects of Nature are produced; we must attribute to\r\nthem the effects of nutrition and expansion, which cannot be effected\r\nby any other means than the penetration of the most intimate recesses\r\nof the original mould: in the same mode as gravity penetrates all parts\r\nof matter, so the power which impels or attracts the organic particles\r\nof food, penetrates into the internal parts of organized bodies, and\r\nas those bodies have a certain form, which we call the internal mould,\r\nthe organic particles, impelled by the action of the penetrating force,\r\ncannot enter therein but in a certain order relative to this form,\r\nwhich consequently it cannot change, but only augment its dimensions,\r\nand thus produce the growth of organized bodies; and if in the\r\norganized body, expanded by this means, there are some particles whose\r\nexternal and internal forms are like that of the whole body, from those\r\nreproduction will proceed.\r\n\r\nThe third question, Is it not by a similar power the internal mould\r\nitself is reproduced? It appears, that it is not only a similar but\r\nthe same power which causes expansion and reproduction, for in an\r\norganized body which expands, if there is some particle like the whole,\r\nit is sufficient for that particle to become one day an organized\r\nbody itself, perfectly similar to that of which it made a part. This\r\nparticle will not at first present a figure striking enough for us to\r\ncompare with the whole body; but when separated from that body, and\r\nreceiving proper nourishment, it will begin to expand, and in a short\r\ntime present a similar being, both externally and internally, as the\r\nbody from which it had been separated: thus a willow or polypus, which\r\ncontain more organic particles similar to the whole than most other\r\nsubstances, if cut into ever such a number of pieces, from each piece\r\nwill spring a body similar to that from whence it was divided.\r\n\r\nNow in a body, every particle of which is like itself, the organization\r\nis the most simple, as we have observed in the first chapter; for it\r\nis only the repetition of the same form, and a composition of similar\r\nfigures, all organized alike. It is for this reason that the most\r\nsimple bodies, or the most imperfect kinds, are reproduced with the\r\ngreatest ease, and in the greatest plenty; whereas, if an organized\r\nbody contains only some few particles like itself, then, as such alone\r\ncan arrive to the second expansion, consequently the reproduction will\r\nbe more difficult, and not so abundant in number; the organization\r\nof these bodies will also be more compounded, because the more the\r\norganized parts differ from the whole, the more the organization of\r\nthis body will be perfect, and the more difficult the production will\r\nbe.\r\n\r\nNourishment, expansion, and propagation, then, are the effects of one\r\nand the same cause. The organized body is nourished by the particles\r\nof aliments analogous to it; it expands by the intimate susception\r\nof organical parts which agree with it, and it propagates because\r\nit contains some original particles which resemble itself. It only\r\nremains to examine, whether these similar organic particles come into\r\nthe organized body by nutriment, or whether they were there before,\r\nand have an independent existence. If we suppose the latter, we shall\r\nfall in with the doctrine of the infinity of parts, or similar germs\r\ncontained one in the other; the insufficiency and absurdity of which\r\nhypothesis we have already shewn; we must therefore conclude that\r\nsimilar parts are extracted from the food; and after what has been\r\nsaid, we hope to explain the manner in which the organic molecules are\r\nformed, and how the minute particles unite.\r\n\r\nThere is, as we have said, a separation of the parts in the nutriment;\r\nthe organic from those analogous to the animal or vegetable, by\r\ntranspiration and other excretory modes; the organical remain and serve\r\nfor the expansion and nutriment of the body. But these organic parts\r\nmust be of various kinds, and as each part of the body receives only\r\nthose similar to itself, and that in due proportion, it is very natural\r\nto imagine, that the superfluity of this organic matter will be sent\r\nback from every part of the body into one or more places, where all\r\nthese organical molecules uniting, form small organized bodies like\r\nthe first, and to which nothing is wanting but the mode of expansion\r\nfor them to become individuals of the same species; for every part\r\nof the body sending back organized parts, like those of which they\r\nthemselves are composed, it is necessary, that from the union of all\r\nthese parts, there should result organized bodies like the first. This\r\nbeing admitted, may we not conclude this is the reason why, during the\r\ntime of expansion and growth, organized bodies cannot produce, because\r\nthe parts which expand absorb the whole of the organic molecules which\r\nbelong to them, and not having any superfluous parts, consequently are\r\nincapable of reproduction.\r\n\r\nThis explanation of nutrition and reproduction will not probably be\r\nreceived by those who admit but of a certain number of mechanical\r\nprinciples, and reject all which do not depend on them; and as what\r\nhas been said of nutrition and expansion comes under the latter\r\ndescription, they will possibly treat it as unworthy dependance. But\r\nI am quite of a different opinion from these philosophers; for it\r\nappears to me that, by admitting only a certain number of mechanical\r\nprinciples, they do not see how greatly they contract the bounds of\r\nphilosophy, and that for one phenomenon that can be explained by a\r\nsystem so confined, a thousand would be found exceeding its limits.\r\n\r\nThe idea of explaining every phenomenon in nature by mechanical\r\nprinciples was certainly a great and beautiful exertion, and which\r\nDescartes first attempted. But this idea is only a project, and if\r\nproperly founded, have we the means of performing it? These mechanical\r\nprinciples are the extent of matter, its impenetrability, its motion,\r\nits external figure, its divisibility, and the communication of\r\nmovement by impulsion, by elasticity, &c. The particular ideas of each\r\nof these qualities we have acquired by our senses, and regard them as\r\nprinciples, because they are general and belong to all matter. But are\r\nwe certain these qualities are the only ones which matter possesses,\r\nor rather, must we not think these qualities, which we take for\r\nprinciples, are only modes of perception; and that if our senses were\r\ndifferently formed, we should discover in matter, qualities different\r\nfrom those which we have enumerated? To admit only those qualities\r\nto matter which are known to us, seems to be a vain and unfounded\r\npretension. Matter may have many general qualities which we shall ever\r\nbe ignorant of; she may also have others that human assiduity may\r\ndiscover, in the same manner as has recently been done with respect\r\nto gravity, which alike exists in all matter. The cause of impulsion,\r\nand such other mechanical principles, will always be as impossible to\r\nfind out as that of attraction, or such other general quality. From\r\nhence is it not very reasonable to say, that mechanical principles are\r\nnothing but general effects, which experience has pointed out to us in\r\nmatter, and that every time a new general effect is discovered, either\r\nby reflection, comparison, measure, or experience, a new mechanical\r\nprinciple will be gained, which may be used with as much certainty and\r\nadvantage as any we are now acquainted with?\r\n\r\nThe defect of Aristotle's philosophy was making use of particular\r\neffects as common causes; and that of Descartes in making use of only\r\na few general effects as causes, and excluding all the rest. The\r\nphilosophy which appears to me would be the least deficient, is that\r\nwhere general effects are only made use of for causes, and seeking to\r\naugment the number of them, by endeavouring to generalize particular\r\neffects.\r\n\r\nIn my explanation of expansion and reproduction, I admit the received\r\nmechanical principles, the penetrating force of weight, and, by\r\nanalogy, I have strove to point out that there are other penetrating\r\npowers existing in organized bodies, which experience has confirmed. I\r\nhave proved by facts, that matter inclines to organization, and that\r\nthere exists an infinite number of organic particles. I have therefore\r\nonly generalized some observations, without having advanced any thing\r\ncontrary to mechanical principles, when that term is used as it ought\r\nto be understood, as denoting the general effects of Nature.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nOF THE GENERATION OF ANIMALS.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs human and animal organization is the most perfect and compounded,\r\ntheir propagation is also the most difficult and least abundant; I here\r\nexcept those animals which, like the fresh-water polypus or worms, are\r\nreproduced from their divided parts, as trees are by slips, or plants\r\nby their divided roots or suckers; also those which may be found to\r\nmultiply without copulation; it appears to me that the nature of those\r\nhave been sufficiently explained in the preceding chapter; and from\r\nwhich, in every kind where an individual produces its resemblance, it\r\nis easy to deduce the explanation of the reproduction from expansion\r\nand nutrition.\r\n\r\nBut how shall we apply this mode of reasoning to the generation of man\r\nand animals distinguished by sexes, and where the concurrence of two\r\nindividuals is required? We understand, by what has just been advanced,\r\nhow each individual can produce its like; but we do not conceive how a\r\nmale and a female produces a third.\r\n\r\nBefore I answer this question, I cannot avoid observing, that all those\r\nwho have written upon this subject have confined their systems to the\r\ngeneration of man and animals, without paying any attention to other\r\nkinds of generation which Nature presents us with, and reproduction\r\nin general; and as the generation of man and animals is the most\r\ncomplicated of all kinds, their researches have been attended with\r\ngreat disadvantages, not only by attacking the most difficult point,\r\nbut also by having no subject of comparison, from which they could draw\r\na solution of the question. To this it is that I principally attribute\r\nthe little success of their labours; but by the road I have taken\r\nwe may arrive at the explanation of the phenomena of every kind of\r\ngeneration in a satisfactory manner.\r\n\r\nThe generation of man will serve us for an example. I take him in his\r\ninfancy, and I conceive that the expansion and growth of the different\r\nparts of his body being made by the intimate penetration of organic\r\nmolecules analogous to each of its parts, all these organic molecules\r\nare absorbed in his earliest years, and serve only for the expansion\r\nand augmentation of his various members, consequently there is little\r\nor no superfluity until the expansion is entirely completed; and this\r\nis the reason why children are incapable of propagation; but when\r\nthe body has attained the greatest part of its growth, it begins to\r\nhave no longer need of so great a quantity of organic particles, and\r\nthe superfluity, therefore, is sent back from each part of the body\r\ninto the destined reservoirs for its reception. These reservoirs are\r\nthe testicles and seminal vessels, and it is at this period that the\r\nexpansion of the body is nearly completed, when the commencement of\r\npuberty is dated, and every circumstance indicates the superabundance\r\nof nutriment; the voice alters and takes a deeper tone; the beard\r\nbegins to appear, and other parts of the body are covered with hair;\r\nthose parts which are appointed for generation take a quick growth; the\r\nseminal liquor fills the prepared reservoirs, and when the plentitude\r\nis too great, even without any provocation, and during the time of\r\nsleep, it emits from the body. In the female this superabundance is\r\nmore strongly marked, it discovers itself by periodical evacuation,\r\nwhich begin and end with the faculty of propagating, by the quick\r\ngrowth of the breasts, and by an attraction in the sexual parts, as\r\nshall be explained.\r\n\r\nI think, therefore, that the organical molecules, sent from every part\r\nof the body into the testicles and seminal vessels of the male, and\r\ninto the ovarium of the female, forms there the seminal liquor, which\r\nis, as has been observed, in both sexes, a kind of extract of every\r\npart of the body. These organical molecules, instead of uniting and\r\nforming an individual, like the one in which they are contained, can\r\nonly unite when the seminal liquors of the two sexes are mixed; and\r\nwhen there is more organical molecules of the male than of the female,\r\nin such mixture the produce will be a male; and, on the contrary, when\r\nthere is more of the female then a female will be the result.\r\n\r\nI do not mean to say that the organic molecules of either could unite\r\nto form small organized bodies of themselves, but that it is necessary\r\na mixture of the seminal fluid of both sexes should take place, and\r\nthat it is only those formed in that mixture which can expand and\r\nbecome individuals. These small moving bodies, called _spermatic\r\nanimals_, are seen, by a microscope, in the seminal liquor of every\r\nmale, and are, probably, small organized bodies, proceeding from the\r\nindividual which contains them, but which cannot expand or produce any\r\nthing of themselves. We shall evince that there are the same in the\r\nseminal liquor of the female, and shall indicate the place where this\r\nliquor is to be found.\r\n\r\nIt is very possible that organical molecules are, at first, only a\r\nkind of foetus of a small organized body, in which there are only\r\nessential parts. We shall not enter into a detail of proofs, in this\r\nrespect, but content ourselves with remarking, that the pretended\r\nspermatic animals, which we have been speaking of, might possibly be\r\nbut imperfectly organized, or that these pretended animals are only\r\nliving organic particles, common both to animals and vegetables, or, at\r\nmost, only the first union of those particles.\r\n\r\nBut let us return to our principal object. How can we conceive, it may\r\nbe asked, that the superfluous particles can be sent back from every\r\npart of the body, and afterwards unite when the seminal liquor of the\r\ntwo sexes are mixed? Besides, is it certain that this mixture is made?\r\nHas it not been pretended that the female did not furnish any fluid of\r\nthis kind? Is it certain that the liquor of the male enters the matrix,\r\n&c.\r\n\r\nTo the first question I answer, if what I have said on the subject\r\nof the penetration of the internal mould by organic molecules, in\r\nnutrition or expansion, be well understood, it will easily be conceived\r\nthat these molecules, not being able any longer to penetrate those\r\nparts they did before, they will be necessitated to take a different\r\nroad, and consequently arrive at some part, as the testicles or seminal\r\nvessels; for to explain the animal economy, and the different movements\r\nof the human body, solely by mechanical principles, is the same as if\r\na man would give an account of a picture by shutting his eyes and\r\nfeeling on it; for it is evident that neither the circulation of the\r\nblood, nor the motion of the muscles, nor the animal functions, can\r\nbe explained by impulsion, nor other common laws of mechanics: it is\r\nas evident that nutrition, expansion, and reproduction, is made by\r\nother laws, why therefore not admit of acting and penetrating powers\r\non the masses of bodies, since we have examples of it in gravity, in\r\nmagnetical attractions, and in chemical affinities? And as we are\r\nnow convinced by facts, and the multitude of constant and uniform\r\nobservations, that there exists in nature powers which do not act by\r\nthe mode of impulsion, why should we not make use of those powers as\r\nmechanical principles? Why should we exclude them from the explanations\r\nof effects, which we are convinced they produce? Why should we be\r\nconfined to employ only the power of impulsion? Is not this like\r\njudging of a picture by the touch, and explaining the phenomena of the\r\nmass by those of the surface, and the penetrating power by superficial\r\naction? Is not this making use of one sense instead of another; and,\r\non the whole, is it not confining the faculty of reasoning on a small\r\nnumber of mechanical principles, totally inadequate to follow the\r\nvarious productions of nature.\r\n\r\nBut those penetrating powers being once admitted, is it not natural\r\nto suppose that the most analogous particles will unite and bind\r\nthemselves intimately together; that each part of the body will\r\nappropriate the most agreeable to itself, and that from the superfluity\r\nof all these particles there will be formed a seminal fluid, which\r\nwill contain all the organic molecules necessary to form a small\r\norganized body, perfectly like that from which this fluid is extracted?\r\nA power like that which was necessary to make them penetrate into each\r\npart, and produce expansion, may be sufficient to collect them in an\r\norganized form, like that of the body in which they originated.\r\n\r\nI conceive, that in the aliments we take there is a great quantity\r\nof organical molecules, which needs no serious proof, since we live\r\non animals and vegetables, which are organized substances. In the\r\nstomach and intestines a separation is made of the gross parts,\r\nwhich are thrown off by the excretories. The chyle, which is the\r\npurest part of the aliment, enters into the lacteal vessels, and from\r\nthence is transported into every part of the body. By the motion of\r\nthe circulation it purifies itself from all inorganical molecules,\r\nwhich are thrown off by secretion and transpiration; but the organic\r\nparticles remain, because they are analogous to the blood, and that\r\nfrom thence there is a power of affinity which retains them afterwards;\r\nfor as the whole mass of blood passes many times through the body, I\r\napprehend, that in this continual circulation every particular part\r\nof the body attracts the particles most analogous to it, without\r\ninterrupting the course of the others. In this manner every part is\r\nexpanded and nourished, not, as it is commonly said, by a simple\r\naddition of the parts, and a superficial increase, but by an intimate\r\npenetration of substance, produced by a power which acts on every point\r\nof the mass; and when the parts of the body are at a certain growth,\r\nand almost filled with these analogous particles, as their substance is\r\nbecome more solid, I conceive they then lose the faculty of attracting\r\nor receiving those particles, but as the circulation will continue\r\nto carry them to every part of the body, which not being any longer\r\nable to admit them as before, must necessarily be deposited in some\r\nparticular part, as in the testicles or seminal vessels. This fluid\r\nextract of the male, when mixed with that of the female, the similar\r\nparticles, possessing a penetrating force, unite and form a small\r\norganized body like one of the two sexes, and no more than expansion\r\nis wanting to render it a similar individual, and which it afterwards\r\nreceives in the womb of the female.\r\n\r\nThe second question, Whether the female has really a seminal liquor\r\nsimilar to the male? demands some discussion. I shall first observe,\r\nas a certain matter, that if such a fluid exists, the manner in which\r\nthe emission of the female is made is not so apparent as by the male,\r\nbeing in general retained within the body.[BJ] The ancients so little\r\ndoubted of the female having a seminal liquor, that it was by the\r\ndifferent mode of its emission that they distinguished the male from\r\nthe female. But physicians, who have endeavoured to explain generation\r\nby the egg, or by spermatic animalcules, insinuate that females have no\r\nparticular fluid, that we have been deceived by taking the mucus for\r\nthe seminal, and that the supposition of the ancients upon this subject\r\nwas destitute of all foundation. Nevertheless this fluid does exist,\r\nand it has only been doubted by those who chose to give way to systems,\r\nand from the difficulty of discovering the parts which serve for its\r\nreservoirs. The fluid which issues from the glands at the neck of the\r\nwomb, and at the orifice of the urethra, has no apparent reservoir,\r\nand as it flows outwardly it cannot be thought to be the prolific\r\nliquor, since it cannot concur in the formation of the foetus which\r\nis performed within the matrix. The prolific fluid of the female must\r\nhave a reservoir in another part. It flows even in great plenty,\r\nalthough such a quantity is not necessary, no more than in the male,\r\nfor the production of the embryo. It is sufficient for propagation if\r\never so little of the male fluid enters the matrix, so it meets with\r\nthe smallest drop of that of the female; therefore the observations\r\nof some anatomists, who have pretended that the seminal liquor of\r\nthe male does not enter the womb, makes nothing against what we have\r\nadvanced, especially as other anatomists, who rely on observations,\r\nhave pretended the contrary. But the subject will be better discussed\r\nin the subsequent pages.\r\n\r\n[BJ] Quod intra se semen jacit fæmina vocatur; quod in hac jacit, mas,\r\nAristotle, art. 18 de Animalibus.\r\n\r\nHaving thus given answers to possible objections, let us now look into\r\nthe reasons which may serve as proofs to our explanation. The first is\r\nderived from the analogy there is between expansion and reproduction;\r\nexpansion cannot be explained in a satisfactory manner, without\r\nemploying those penetrating powers, and those affinities or attractions\r\nwe have already made use of to explain the formation of small organized\r\nbeings, resembling the great ones which contain them. A second analogy\r\nis, that nutrition and reproduction are both not only produced by\r\nthe same efficient, but also by the same material cause, the organic\r\nparticles of the nutriment. And a proof that it is the superfluity of\r\nthose particles which serves for reproduction, is the body not being\r\nin a condition to propagate before they have done growing; and we\r\ndaily see in dogs, and other animals, who more exactly follow the laws\r\nof nature than we, that they nearly attain their full growth before\r\nthey attempt to copulate, and by which we may know whether a dog will\r\nincrease any more or not; for we may be assured he will not after being\r\nin a condition to engender.\r\n\r\nIt is another proof that the superfluous nutriment forms the seminal\r\nliquor, that eunuchs, and all mutilated animals, grow larger or\r\nthicker than those who have not that deficiency. The superabundance of\r\nnutriment not being able to evacuate, for the defect of proper organs,\r\nalters the habit of the body; the thighs and haunches of eunuchs grow\r\nvery large: the reason is evident; after their body has attained the\r\ncommon size, if the superfluous organic molecules found an issue, as\r\nin other men, this growth would no longer increase; but as there are\r\nno longer organs for the emission of the seminal fluid, which is no\r\nmore than the superfluous matter which served for growth remains, it\r\nendeavours to expand the parts beyond their usual dimensions. Now it\r\nis known, that the growth of the bones is made by the extremities,\r\nwhich are soft and spongy, and when they have once acquired solidity,\r\nthey are no longer capable of extension; and for this reason, the\r\nsuperfluous organic particles can only expand the spongy extremities\r\nof bones, which causes the thighs, knees, &c. of eunuchs to thicken so\r\nconsiderably.\r\n\r\nBut what more strongly proves the truth of our explanation, is the\r\nresemblance of children to their parents. A son, in general, more\r\nresembles his father than his mother, and the daughter more her mother\r\nthan her father; because a man has a greater resemblance to a man than\r\nto a woman, and a woman resembles more a woman than a man, in respect\r\nto the whole habitude of the body; but for the features and particular\r\nhabits, children sometimes resemble the father, sometimes the mother,\r\nand sometimes both. They will have, for example, the father's eyes,\r\nand the mouth of the mother, or the complexion of the latter, and the\r\nsize of the former; which is impossible to be conceived, unless it is\r\nadmitted that both parents have contributed to the formation of the\r\nchild, and that consequently there was a mixture of the two seminal\r\nfluids.\r\n\r\nI acknowledge that resemblances raised many difficulties in my own\r\nmind; before I had maturely examined the question of generation, I\r\nwas prepossessed with ideas of a mixed system, by which it appeared\r\nthat I could explain in a probable manner every phenomena, excepting\r\nresemblances, and these I thought I had found very specious reasons\r\nto doubt, and which deceived me a long time, until having minutely\r\nobserved, with all the exactness I was capable of, a great number\r\nof families, and especially the most numerous, I have not been able\r\nto resist the multiplicity of proofs; it is only after being fully\r\nconvinced in this respect, that I have began to think differently, and\r\nto credit what I now believe to be the fact.\r\n\r\nBesides, although I had found the mode to avoid those arguments that\r\nwould be made on the subject of mulattos, mongrels, and mules, I could\r\nnot be prevented from observing that every explanation, where a reason\r\ncould be given for the phenomena, cannot be satisfactory; and I am\r\nnow perfectly convinced that the objections which might be used with\r\nrespect to them, as well as particular parental resemblances, instead\r\nof opposing would confirm my explanation.\r\n\r\nI now proceed to draw some consequences. In youth the seminal fluid\r\nis less abundant, although more stimulating; its quantity encreases\r\nto a certain age, because in proportion as we approach that age, the\r\nparts of the body become more solid, admit less nutriment, send back a\r\ngreater quantity to the common reservoirs, and consequently produce a\r\ngreater abundance of seminal fluid. When the external organs have not\r\nbeen used, persons of a middling age, and even old men, more easily\r\nengender than young ones. This is evident in the vegetable system, the\r\nolder a tree is, the more fruit or seed it produces.\r\n\r\nYoung people who emit, or force irritation, draw a greater quantity of\r\nseminal fluid towards the organs of generation than would naturally\r\narrive there, the consequence is, they cease from growing, become\r\nthin, and fall at length into consumptions, and that because they lose\r\nby premature, and too often reiterated evacuations, the necessary\r\nsubstance for the growth and nutrition of every part of the body.\r\n\r\nThose whose bodies are thin without emaciation, or fleshy without being\r\nfat, are the most vigorous; as soon as the superabundant nutriment has\r\nbegun to form fat, it is always at the expence of the seminal fluid,\r\nand other faculties of generation. When also, not only the growth of\r\nevery part of the body is entirely completed, but the bones are grown\r\nsolid, the cartilages begin to ossify, the membranes have received\r\nall the solidity possible, the fibres are become hard and rough, and\r\nat length every part of the body can no longer scarcely admit of\r\nnutriment, the fat considerably increases, and the quantity of seminal\r\nfluid diminishes, because the superfluous particles, stopped in every\r\npart of the body, and the fibres, having no longer any suppleness or\r\nelasticity, cannot return it into the reservoirs of generation.\r\n\r\nThe seminal liquor not only becomes more abundant till a certain age,\r\nbut it also becomes thicker, and contains a greater quantity of matter\r\nunder the same bulk. A person, very observant in this point, assured me\r\nthat the seminal fluid is as heavy again as the blood, and consequently\r\nspecifically heavier than any other fluid of the body.\r\n\r\nWhen a man is in good health the evacuation of this fluid produces\r\nan appetite, and he soon feels the necessity of repairing, by a new\r\nnutriment, the loss of the old; from whence it may be concluded, that\r\nthe most efficacious check to every kind of luxury is abstinence and\r\nfasting.\r\n\r\nA number of other things remain to be said on this subject, but which\r\nI have treated of in the History of Man; however, before I entirely\r\nclose, I shall make some few observations. The greatest part of animals\r\ndo not seek for copulation until they are nearly arrived at their\r\nfull growth; those which have only a particular season in the year\r\nhave only seminal liquor at that time. A very capable observer of\r\nNature[BK] not only saw this liquor forming in the roe of a Calmar, but\r\neven observed the spermatic animals and the roe itself, which have no\r\nexistence till the month of October, the time when the Calmar spawns\r\non the coast of Portugal, where Mr. Needham made these observations.\r\nAs soon as the season is over neither seminal liquor nor spermatic\r\nanimals are longer seen in the milt, which then dries up and becomes\r\nimperceptible till the season returns in the succeeding year, when\r\nthe superfluous nutriment renews the milt, and fills it as before. In\r\nthe history of the stag we have an opportunity of remarking on the\r\ndifferent effects of rutting; the most general is, the increased size\r\nof the animal; and in those kinds of animals whose rutting or spawning\r\nis only made at great intervals, the extenuation of the body is\r\nproportionably great.\r\n\r\n[BK] Mr. Needham's New Microscopical Discoveries, London, 1745.\r\n\r\nAs women are smaller and weaker than men, of a more delicate\r\ntemperament, and eat much less, it is natural to imagine that their\r\nsuperfluous organic particles are not so plentiful; from hence their\r\nseminal liquor will be weaker, and less in quantity, than that of men.\r\nSince, likewise, the seminal liquor of females contains fewer organic\r\nparticles than that of males, must there not result a greater number\r\nof males than females from the mixture of these two liquors? This is\r\nreally the case, for which it has hitherto been thought impossible\r\nto find a reason. About a sixteenth more male children are born than\r\nfemales; and we find that the same cause produces the same effect\r\nin all kinds of animals on which we have been able to make this\r\nobservation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nEXPOSITION OF THE SYSTEMS IN GENERATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nPlato[BL] not only explains the generation of man, animals, plants,\r\nand elements, but even that of heaven and the gods, by reflected\r\nrepresentations and images extracted from the Divine Creator, which,\r\nby an harmonic motion, are ranged according to the properties of\r\nnumbers in the most perfect order. The universe, according to him,\r\nis a copy of the Deity: time, space, motion, and matter, are images\r\nof his attributes; and secondary and particular causes are results\r\nof numerical and harmonical qualities of those representations. The\r\nworld is the most perfect being, and to have a complete perfection it\r\nwas necessary that it contained every other animal, every possible\r\nrepresentation, and every imaginable form, of the creative faculty.\r\nThe essence of all generation consists in the unity and harmony of the\r\nnumber Three, or of the triangle, viz. that _which_ generates, that\r\n_in which_ generation is performed, and that _which is_ engendered.\r\nThe succession of individuals in the species is only a fugitive image\r\nof the immutable eternity of this triangular harmony, the universal\r\nprototype of every existence and every generation; for this reason\r\ntwo individuals are required to produce a third, and it is this which\r\nconstitutes the essential order of father, mother, and child.\r\n\r\n[BL] See the Timæus.\r\n\r\nThis philosopher is a painter only of ideas; disengaged from matter\r\nhe elevates into the regions of abstraction, and, losing sight\r\nof sensible objects, perceives and contemplates the intellectual\r\nalone. One cause, one end, and one sole mode, form the whole of his\r\nperceptions. God is the cause, perfection the end, and harmonic\r\nrepresentations the modes. What can be a more sublime idea! This plan\r\nof philosophy is replete with simplicity, and the views truly noble!\r\nbut how void and destitute for speculation? We are not purely spiritual\r\nbeings, nor have we the power to give a real existence to our ideas.\r\nConfined to matter, our rather dependent on what causes our sensations,\r\nthe real substance can never be produced by the abstracted. I answer\r\nPlato in his own language, \"The Creator realizes every thing he\r\nconceives; his perceptions engender existence: the created being, on\r\nthe contrary, conceives nothing by retrenching them but from reality,\r\nand the production of his ideas do not amount to any thing.\"\r\n\r\nLet us then content ourselves with a more humble and more material\r\nphilosophy; and by keeping within the sphere Nature has allotted us,\r\nlet us examine the rash steps and the rapid flight of those who attempt\r\nto soar beyond it. All this Pythagorean philosophy, which is purely\r\nintellectual, turns entirely on two principles, one of which is false\r\nand the other precarious: those are, the real power of abstraction,\r\nand the actual existence of final causes. To take numbers for real\r\nbeings; to say that unity is a general individual, which not only\r\nrepresents every individual, but even communicates existence to them;\r\nto pretend that unity has the actual power to engender another unity\r\nnearly similar to itself, and constituting two individuals, two sides\r\nof a triangle, which can have no bound or perfection without a third\r\nside, or by a third individual, which they necessarily engender. To\r\nregard numbers, geometrical lines, and metaphysical abstractions, as\r\nefficient and real physical causes, on which the formation of the\r\nelements, the generation of animals and plants, and all the phenomena\r\nof Nature depend, seems to me to be the most absurd abuse of reason,\r\nand the greatest obstacle that can be put against the advancement of\r\nour knowledge. Besides, what can be more false than such suppositions?\r\nAdmitting, with Plato and Malebranche, that matter does not exist,\r\nthat external objects are only ideal images of the creative faculty,\r\nand that we perceive every thing in the Deity, must it be concluded\r\nfrom thence that our ideas should be of the same order as those of the\r\nCreator, or that they can produce existences? Are not we dependent on\r\nour sensations? Whether the objects that cause them are real or not;\r\nwhether this cause of our sensations exists outwardly or inwardly;\r\nwhether it be the Creator or matter we perceive, what does it signify\r\nto us? Are we less certain of being always affected in the same manner\r\nby the same causes? Have not our sensations an invariable order of\r\nexistence, and a necessary relation between them and the objects? This,\r\ntherefore, is what must constitute the principles of our philosophy;\r\nand what has no relation with it is vain, useless, and false in the\r\napplication. Can a triangular harmony form the substance of the\r\nelements? Is fire, as Plato affirms, an acute triangle, and light and\r\nheat properties of this triangle? Air and water, are they rectangular\r\nand equilateral triangles? Is the form of the terrestrial element a\r\nsquare, because, being the least perfect of all the four elements,\r\nit recedes as much as possible from a triangle without losing its\r\nessence? Do the male and female embrace only to complete the triangle\r\nof generation? These platonic ideas have two very different aspects.\r\nIn speculation they seem to flow from noble and sublime principles, but\r\nin application nothing but false and puerile consequences can be drawn\r\nfrom them.\r\n\r\nIs it difficult to discover that our ideas proceed only from our\r\nsenses? that the things we look on as real and existing are those of\r\nwhich our senses have always rendered us the same testimony? that\r\nthose which we conceive to have certain existence are those which ever\r\npresent themselves in the same order? that consequently our ideas,\r\nvery far from being the causes of things, are only effects, and so far\r\nfrom resembling particular things, become less similar to the objects\r\nas they are more general; that at length our mental abstractions are\r\nonly negative beings, which do not exist even intellectually but by the\r\nretrenchment which we make of sensible qualities to real beings.\r\n\r\nFrom hence is it not plain that abstractions can never become\r\nprinciples, neither of existence nor real knowledge? on the contrary,\r\nour knowledge can only proceed from the results of properly comparing\r\nour sensations. These results are what is termed _experience_, the sole\r\nsource of all real science. The adoption of every other principle is an\r\nabuse, and every edifice built on abstracted ideas is a temple founded\r\non error.\r\n\r\nError bears a much more extended signification in philosophy\r\nthan in morality: in morals a thing may be false, only because\r\nit is misrepresented. Metaphysical falsehood consists not in\r\nmisrepresentation alone, but in crediting that which has no existence,\r\nand even in not being of any mode whatever. It is in this kind of\r\nerror, of the first order, that the Platonists, the Sceptics, and the\r\nEgotists have fallen into, their false suppositions have obscured the\r\nnatural light of truth, clouded reason, and retarded the advancement of\r\nphilosophy.\r\n\r\nThe second principle made use of by Plato, and by most of the\r\nspeculative philosophers, is a final cause. Nevertheless, to reduce\r\nthis principle to its just value, a single moment of reflection is\r\nonly requisite. To say there is light because we have eyes, and sounds\r\nbecause we have ears, or to say that we have ears and eyes because\r\nthere is light and sound, is it not exactly the same thing? shall we\r\never discover any thing by this mode of explanation? Is it not evident\r\nthat final causes are only arbitrary relations and moral abstractions,\r\nwhich should impose on us still less than metaphysical abstractions,\r\nbecause their origin is less noble and a more false supposition; and\r\nalthough Leibnitz has endeavoured to raise this principle to the\r\nhighest degree by the name of _sufficient reason_, and Plato has\r\nrepresented it by the most flattering portrait, under the title of\r\n_perfection_, yet it cannot prevent our seeing it as trifling and\r\nprecarious. Are we better acquainted with the effects of Nature, from\r\nbeing told that nothing is made without a reason, or that all is made\r\nin view of perfection? What is this sufficient reason? what is this\r\nperfection? are they not moral beings created by intellects purely\r\nhuman? are they not arbitrary relations which we have generalized? on\r\nwhat are they founded? on moral affinities which, far from producing\r\nany physical or real existence, only alter the reality and confound the\r\nobjects of our sensations, perceptions and knowledge, with those of our\r\nsentiments, our passions and our wills.\r\n\r\nI could adduce many arguments on this subject, but I do not pretend to\r\nmake a treatise on philosophy, and shall return to physics, from which\r\nthe ideas of Plato on universal generation made me digress. Aristotle,\r\nwho was as great a philosopher as Plato and a much better physician,\r\ninstead of losing himself in the region of hypotheses, relied, on\r\nthe contrary, on collected facts, and speaks in a more intelligible\r\nlanguage.\r\n\r\nMatter, which is only a capacity of receiving forms, takes in\r\ngeneration a form like that of the individual which furnishes it; and\r\nwith respect to the generation of animals that have sexes, he thinks\r\nthat the male alone furnishes the prolific principle, and that the\r\nfemale affords nothing that can be looked upon as such.[BM] For though\r\nhe says elsewhere, speaking of animals in general, that the female\r\nemits a seminal fluid within herself, yet he does not regard that as a\r\nprolific principle: nevertheless, according to him, the menstrual blood\r\nserves for the formation, growth, and nutriment of the foetus, but\r\nthe efficient principles exist only in the seminal fluid of the male,\r\nwhich does not act like matter, but as the cause. Averrhois, Avicenna,\r\nand other philosophers, who followed the sentiments of Aristotle, have\r\nsought for reasons to prove that females have no prolific fluid; they\r\nurge, that as females have a menstrual fluid that was necessary and\r\nsufficient for generation, it does not appear natural to suppose they\r\npossess any other; particularly because it begins to appear, like the\r\nseminal fluid in the males, at the age of puberty; besides, continue\r\nthey, if females have really a seminal and prolific fluid, why do they\r\nnot produce without the approach of the male, since they contain the\r\nprolific principle as well as the matter necessary for the nutriment\r\nand growth of the embryo? This last reason seems to be the only one\r\nwhich merits any attention. The menstrual blood seems to be necessary\r\nfor the support, nutriment, and growth of the foetus, but it can\r\nhave no part in the first formation, which is made by the mixture of\r\ntwo fluids alike prolific. Females therefore may have, as well as the\r\nmales, a prolific fluid for the formation of the embryo, besides the\r\nmenstrual blood for its nutriment and expansion; and certainly a female\r\nbeing possessed of a prolific fluid, extracted from all parts of her\r\nbody, as well as the necessary means of nourishment and expansion, it\r\nis no impossible imagination that she would produce females without any\r\ncommunication with the male. It must be allowed, that this metaphysical\r\nreasoning which the Aristotelians adopt to prove that females have no\r\nprolific fluid, may become the most considerable objection that can be\r\nmade against all systems of generation, and particularly against our\r\nexplanation.\r\n\r\n[BM] See Aristotle, de gen. lib. i. cap. 20 and lib. xi. cap. 4.\r\n\r\nLet us suppose, it may be said, as you have attempted to prove, that\r\nthe superfluous organic molecules are sent back into the testicles\r\nand seminal vessels of the male, why, by the power of your supposed\r\nattracting forces, do they not form small organized beings, perfectly\r\nresembling the male? and for the same reason similar beings in the\r\nfemale? If you answer, that there is an appearance that the liquor of\r\nthe male contains only males, and that of the female only females, but\r\nthat all these perish for want of the necessary means for expansion,\r\nand that there are only those formed by the mixture of both which can\r\nexpand and come into the world; may we not be asked why this mode\r\nof generation, which is the most complicated, difficult, and least\r\nabundant, is that which Nature prefers in so striking a manner, that\r\nalmost all animals multiply by this mode of communication of the male\r\nwith the female?\r\n\r\nI shall content myself at present with answering, that the fact is such\r\nas we have represented it; the objection becomes a fact question; to\r\nwhich, as we have observed, there is no other solution to be given\r\nthan that of the fact itself. It may be insisted, it is the most\r\ncomplicated mode of production; yet this mode, which appears the most\r\ncomplicated to us, is certainly the most simple for nature, because,\r\nas we have remarked, what happens the most often, however difficult\r\nit may appear to our ideas, must in reality be the most simple; which\r\ndoes not prevent us from conceiving it to be complex, as we judge of it\r\naccording to that knowledge which our senses and reflections can give\r\nus thereon.\r\n\r\nThe assertion of the Aristotelians, that females have no prolific\r\nfluid, must fall to the ground, if we pay attention to the resemblance\r\nof children to their mothers, of mules to the female that produces\r\nthem, of mongrels and mulattos, all of which resemble more the mother\r\nthan the father. If, besides these, we consider the organs of females\r\nare, like those of the males, formed so as to prepare and receive the\r\nseminal fluid, we shall be readily persuaded that such a fluid must\r\nexist, whether it resides in the spermatic vessels, the testicles, or\r\nin the matrix: or whether it issues, when provoked, by the passages of\r\nde Graaf, situated at the neck, and near the external orifice of the\r\nurethra.\r\n\r\nBut it is right here to examine the ideas of Aristotle more generally\r\non the subject of generation, because this great philosopher has\r\nwritten the most on the subject, and treated it the most generally.\r\nHe distinguishes animals into three classes; first, those which have\r\nblood, and, excepting some few, multiply by copulation; the second,\r\nthose which have no blood, but, being at the same time both male and\r\nfemale, produce of themselves, and without copulation; and thirdly,\r\nthose bred by putrefaction, which do not owe their origin to parents\r\nof any kind. I shall first remark, that this division must not be\r\nadmitted of; for though in fact all kinds of animals which have blood\r\nare composed of males and females, it is not equally true, that animals\r\nwho have no blood are for the most part male and female in one; for we\r\nare only acquainted with the snail and worm on earth which are in this\r\nstate; nor can we ascertain whether all shell-fish, and other animals\r\nwhich have no blood, be hermaphrodites. With respect to those animals\r\nwhich he says proceed from putrefaction, as he has not enumerated\r\nthem, many exceptions occur; for most of the kinds which the ancients\r\nthought engendered by putrefaction have been discovered by the moderns\r\nto be the produce of eggs.\r\n\r\nAfter this he makes a second division of animals; those which have\r\nthe faculty of moving themselves progressively, as walking, flying,\r\nswimming, and those which have no such faculty. All animals which\r\ncan move, and have blood, have sexes; but those which, like oysters,\r\nare adherent, or who scarcely move at all, have no sex, and are, in\r\nthis respect like plants, distinguished only, as he says, into males\r\nand females by difference of size. It is not yet ascertained whether\r\nshell-fish have sexes or not; there are in the oyster-kind fruitful\r\nindividuals, and others which are not so; those which are fruitful are\r\ndistinguished by a delicate border which surrounds the body of the\r\noyster, and they are called males.[BN]\r\n\r\n[BN] See the observation of M. Deslandes, in the Tracte de la raine,\r\nParis, 1747.\r\n\r\nBut to proceed, the male, according to Aristotle, includes the\r\nprinciple of generative, motion, and the female contains the material\r\nparts of generation. The organs which serve for this purpose are\r\ndifferent in the different kind of animals; the principal are the\r\ntesticles in the males, and the matrix in the females. Quadrupeds,\r\nbirds, and cetaceous animals, have testicles; fish and serpents are\r\ndeprived of them; but they have both proper conduits to receive and\r\nprepare the seed. These essential parts are always double, both in the\r\nmale and female, and serve in males to stop the motion of the blood,\r\nwhich forms the seed. This he proves by the example of birds, whose\r\ntesticles swell in the season of their amours, and diminish so greatly\r\nwhen this season is over that they are scarcely perceptible.\r\n\r\nAll quadrupeds, as horses, oxen, &c. which are clothed with hair,\r\nand cetaceous fishes, as dolphins and whales, are viviparous; but\r\ncartilaginous animals, and vipers, are not truly viviparous, because\r\nthey produce an egg within themselves before the live animal appears.\r\nOviparous animals are of two kinds, those which produce perfect eggs,\r\nas birds, lizards, turtles, &c. and those which produce imperfect eggs,\r\nas fishes, whose eggs augment and come to perfection after they have\r\nbeen laid in the water by the female; and in all kinds of oviparous\r\nanimals, excepting birds, the females are generally larger than the\r\nmales, as fishes, lizards, &c.\r\n\r\nAfter having mentioned these general varieties in animals, Aristotle\r\nbegins with examining the opinion of the ancient philosophers, that the\r\nseed, as well of the male as of the female, proceeded from all parts of\r\nthe body; he declares against this opinion, because, he says, although\r\nchildren often resemble their fathers and mothers, they also sometimes\r\nresemble their grandfathers; and, besides, they resemble their parents\r\nby the voice, hair, nails, carriage, and manner of walking. Now the\r\nseed, he continues, cannot proceed from the hair, voice, nails, or\r\nany external quality, like that of walking; therefore children do not\r\nresemble their parents because the seed comes from every part of the\r\nbody, but for some other reason. It appears to me unnecessary here to\r\npoint out the weakness of these arguments; I shall only observe that it\r\nappears to me this great man expressly sought after methods to separate\r\nhimself from the sentiments of those philosophers who preceded him;\r\nand I am persuaded, that whoever reads his treatise on generation with\r\nattention, will discover that a strong design of giving a new system,\r\ndifferent from that of the ancients, obliged him always to give the\r\npreference to the least probable reasons, and to elude, as much as he\r\ncould, the force of proofs, when they were contrary to his general\r\nprinciples of philosophy.\r\n\r\nAccording to Aristotle the seminal liquor is secreted from the blood;\r\nand the menstrua, in females, is a similar secretion, and the only one\r\nwhich serves for the purpose of generation. Females, he says, have\r\nno other prolific liquor; there is, therefore, no mixture of that of\r\nthe male with that of the female. He pretends to prove this from some\r\nwomen conceiving without receiving the least pleasure, and because few\r\nwomen emit this liquor externally during copulation; that in general\r\nthose who are brown, and have a masculine appearance, do not emit at\r\nall, yet engender equally with those who are more fair in complexion\r\nand feminine in appearance, and whose emissions are considerable. Thus\r\nhe concludes woman furnishes nothing but the menstrual. This blood\r\nis the matter of generation; and the seminal fluid of the male does\r\nnot contribute as matter but as form; it is the efficient cause, the\r\nprinciple of motion; it is to generation what the sculptor is to a\r\nblock of marble: the liquor of the male is the sculptor, the menstrual\r\nblood the marble, and the foetus the image.\r\n\r\nThe menstrual blood receives from the male seed a kind of soul, which\r\ngives life and motion. This soul is neither material nor immaterial,\r\nbecause it can neither act upon matter nor enter in generation as\r\nmatter, the menstrual blood being all that is necessary for that\r\npurpose. It is, says our philosopher, a spirit, whose substance is\r\nlike that of the starry region. The heart is the first work of this\r\nsoul; it contains in itself the principle of its own growth; and it has\r\nthe power to arrange the other members. The menstrual blood contains\r\nevery other principle of all the parts of the foetus: the soul,\r\nor spirit, of the male seed, makes the heart begin to act, and that\r\ncommunicates the power of bringing the other viscera to action; and\r\nthus, successively, is every part of the animal unfolded and brought\r\ninto motion. All this appeared very clear to our philosopher; there\r\nonly remained to him one doubt, which was, whether the heart was\r\nrealized before the blood; and in fact he had reason for this doubt;\r\nfor, although he had adopted the opinion of the heart existing first,\r\nHarvey has since pretended, by reasons of the same kind as those used\r\nby Aristotle, that it was not the heart but the blood which is first\r\nrealized.\r\n\r\nThis is the system that great philosopher has given us of generation,\r\nand I shall leave it to the opinion of the reader whether that of\r\nthe ancients, which he rejects, can be more obscure or more absurd\r\nthan his; nevertheless, his system has been followed by most of the\r\nlearned. Harvey has not only adopted the ideas of Aristotle, but has\r\nadded new ones of the same kind. As this system of generation is of\r\nthe same kind as the rest of Aristotle's philosophy, where form and\r\nmatter are the grand principles; where the vegetative and sensitive are\r\nthe active beings in Nature; and where final causes are real objects;\r\nI am not surprised that it has been received by scholastic authors;\r\nbut it is astonishing that so able a physician and observer of Nature\r\nas Harvey was, should be carried away with the stream, while every\r\nphysician followed the opinion of Hippocrates and Galen; which we shall\r\nexplain in order. We must not, however, imbibe a disadvantageous idea\r\nof Aristotle from the above exposition of his System of Generation.\r\nIt would be like judging of Descartes by his Treatise on Man. The\r\nexplanations which these two philosophers give of the formation of the\r\nfoetus should not be considered as complete systems on the subject\r\nof generation; they are rather general consequences drawn from their\r\nphilosophical principles.\r\n\r\n\r\n_END OF THE SECOND VOLUME._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscriber Note\r\n\r\nNon-standard capitalization has been retained.
