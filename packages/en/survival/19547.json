GREENO\r\n\r\n1912\r\n\r\nCOPYRIGHTED 1912\r\nBY FOLLETT L. GREENO\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE\r\n\r\n\r\nEvery step in the progress of modern achievement has been met with\r\nstrong resistance and hostile contest. There is in business an actual\r\nfiring line where continuous conflict wages, and so fierce does the\r\nstruggle become that it requires a certain class of men possessing\r\nqualities, not only of energy and perseverance, but of tenacity and\r\ncombativeness, aggressive and determined to fight to the last ditch for\r\ncommercial supremacy. Such men do not always rely upon the merits of\r\ntheir cause, nor do they stop to question the justice or injustice of\r\ntheir methods. They have but one goal, commercial supremacy, and every\r\neffort is bent and every man and method utilized to attain that end.\r\n\r\nMen of inventive genius are rarely of that type. They are more often\r\nunassuming and averse to anything like a personal combat. Such a man was\r\nObed Hussey, inventor of the reaper. Honest and conscientious, enured to\r\nhard and unremitting toil, with the inspiration of a new idea for the\r\nbenefit of mankind burning in his brain, he applied himself in the face\r\nof immense difficulties to the production and perfection of the great\r\ngift which he gave to the world. He was a man at once so humble and so\r\nbroad in his kindness, so loyal to his Quaker ideals of righteousness\r\nand justice, that he offered no protests, or arguments against his\r\nrivals and opponents other than the superiority of his own machine. Only\r\nhis great genius which produced the superior machine (a fact which no\r\none could possibly contradict) could have saved him from the fierce\r\nopposition of his more powerful rivals. One has only to read from some\r\nof his own letters reproduced in this narrative, to witness the fairness\r\nof his attitude, or to gain a knowledge of his scruples.\r\n\r\nYet it was just this which has operated to deprive Obed Hussey of his\r\nwell deserved fame as inventor of the reaper. Moreover, a great industry,\r\nfostered by his opponents in the patent controversy, has grown up, the\r\nbasis and life of which is Obed Hussey's invention of the reaper. It\r\nwould seem that the vast fortunes made from this industry should be ample\r\nreward for those who are receiving the benefits of a man's life work\r\nwithout whose genius it would never have been.\r\n\r\nIn 1897 there was published in Chicago a booklet entitled \"A Brief\r\nNarrative of the Invention of Reaping Machines,\" a large part of which is\r\nreproduced in this book. The pamphlets of which the narrative was a\r\nrepublication were from the pen of Edward Stabler, an able man and a\r\nmechanic of great skill and ability, a close friend of Mr. Hussey and one\r\nfamiliar with his reaper and with all the facts which he set forth in\r\nthese articles. Such other facts and information as are published herein\r\nwere furnished by Martha Hussey, daughter of Mr. Hussey, now living and\r\nby my uncle, Hon. Alexander B. Lamberton, who married Mr. Hussey's widow.\r\nMr. Lamberton is a man of high standing, having for many years taken an\r\nactive part in the affairs of Rochester. He was President of the\r\nRochester Chamber of Commerce, 1901-1904 (three successive terms), and\r\nhas been President of the Rochester Park Board for the past eleven years.\r\nHe also won national fame as a hunter and naturalist and was President of\r\nthe National Association for the Protection of Fish and Game. His\r\nrelation to the Hussey family has made him conversant with the whole\r\nhistory of the invention of the reaper and of Mr. Hussey's early\r\nstruggles.\r\n\r\nThe facts as set forth in this volume are well known to the reaper men of\r\nthe United States, men high up in the industry. Had Mr. Hussey lived, he\r\nwould have been able to establish his claim to the invention of the\r\nreaper beyond the shadow of a doubt. This humble man, who, against\r\ntremendous odds and powerful opposition, proved his contentions before\r\nCongress and the United States Patent Office could certainly have won\r\ndeserved fame with the public.\r\n\r\nHis tragic death, which came just at the time when his Congressional\r\nvictory was certain and the future of his reaper seemed bright with\r\npromise, occurred while he was en route from Boston to Portland, Maine,\r\non August 4, 1860. In those days there was often no water in the cars.\r\nThe train had stopped at a station when a little child asked for a drink\r\nof water and Mr. Hussey stepped out to get it for her. On his return, as\r\nhe attempted to re-enter, the cars started; he was thrown beneath the\r\nwheels and instantly killed. The last act of his life was one of kindness\r\nand compassion.\r\n\r\nObed Hussey is dead, but his machine still lives, an article of\r\nmeasureless value to the great world of agriculture. His life was one of\r\nlong suffering and faithful service and he justly deserves the proper\r\ncredit and honor for his great invention. To Obed Hussey belongs the fame\r\nof Inventor of the Reaper as these pages will show, to which purpose\r\nthese facts are published by those who knew him and his works, and these\r\nfacts, like his works, stand squarely on their own merits.\r\n\r\nFOLLETT L. GREENO.\r\nRochester, N. Y., April 21, 1912.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Obed Hussey, Inventor of the Reaper]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOBED HUSSEY, THE INVENTOR OF THE REAPER\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A Natural Inventor]\r\n\r\nObed Hussey was of Quaker stock, born in Maine in 1792 and early removed\r\nto Nantucket, Mass. When young, like all Nantucket boys, he had a desire\r\nto go to sea, and made one or two whaling voyages. He was of quiet and\r\nretiring disposition, studious, thoughtful, with a strong bent for\r\nstudying intricate mechanical contrivances. Little is known of his early\r\nlife and there is none living who knew him at that time. He was a\r\nskillful draftsman and incessant worker at different inventions all his\r\nlife. He invented a successful steam plow, for which he obtained a medal\r\nin the West. He also invented a machine for grinding out hooks and eyes,\r\na mill for grinding corn and cobs, a husking machine run by horse power,\r\nthe \"iron finger bar,\" a machine for crushing sugar cane, a machine for\r\nmaking artificial ice, and other devices of more or less note.\r\n\r\nHis chief characteristic seems to have been an extremely sensitive,\r\nmodest and unassuming personality. It was this reticence which has served\r\nto keep him in the background as the inventor of the reaper. He was\r\nunwilling to push himself forward, and his claim to distinction has had\r\nto rest solely upon the merits of his greatest invention.\r\n\r\nMr. Hussey first began work on his reaper in a room at the factory of\r\nRichard B. Chenoweth, a manufacturer of agricultural implements, and the\r\nstory of those early efforts is told by Sarah A. Chenoweth, a\r\ngranddaughter of the latter:\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Early Efforts]\r\n\r\n\"As a child, it seemed that I had always known Mr. Hussey. I saw him\r\nevery day of my life, for he lived in a room, the use of which my\r\ngrandfather, Richard B. Chenoweth, a manufacturer of agricultural\r\nimplements in Baltimore City, had given him at his factory. No grown\r\nperson was allowed to enter, for in this room he spent most of his time\r\nmaking patterns for the perfecting of his reaper. I, unforbidden, was\r\nhis constant visitor, and asked him numberless questions, one of which,\r\nI remember, was why he washed and dried his dishes with shavings. His\r\nreply was characteristic of himself, 'Shavings are clean.'\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: First Trial]\r\n\r\n\"At this time I was about seven years of age, having been born in 1824.\r\nAlthough very poor at the time, he was a man of education, upright and\r\nhonorable, and so very gentle in both speech and manner that I never\r\nknew fear or awe of him. I do not know for a certainty how long he\r\nremained there,--several years, at the least, I think, but of his\r\nconnection with the reaper, I am _positive_, for it was talked of\r\nmorning, noon and night. To this day, my brother bears on his finger a\r\nscar, made by receiving a cut from one of the teeth of the machine.\r\nWhen, finally, the model was completed, it was brought out into the yard\r\nof the factory for trial. This trial was made on a board, drilled with\r\nholes, and stuck full of rye straws. I helped to put those very straws\r\nin place. Mr. Hussey, with repressed excitement, stood watching, and\r\nwhen he saw the perfect success of his invention, he hastened to his\r\nroom too moved and agitated to speak. This scene is vividly impressed on\r\nmy mind, as is also a remark made by a workman, that Mr. Hussey did not\r\nwish us to see the tears in his eyes.\"\r\n\r\nThe story of Mr. Hussey's efforts at that time is also told by a brother\r\nof the little granddaughter:\r\n\r\n    \"Chicago, Nov. 25, 1893.\r\n\r\n    \"Clark Lane, Esq.,\r\n    \"Elkhart, Ind.\r\n\r\n    \"My Dear Sir:--\r\n\r\n    \"I notice in this morning's 'Inter Ocean' your letter of 22nd in\r\n    regard to the First Reaper and Obed Hussey; now I can say that the\r\n    name of Obed Hussey called to my mind the best friend of my\r\n    boyhood days, as he was in the habit of keeping me supplied with\r\n    pennies when I was short, and taught me how to put iron on a wood\r\n    sled, and helped me to make my first wagon as he turned the wheel\r\n    for me. You are right with regard to the date of the fingers and\r\n    shaped cutters for Reapers, as I saw and handled it, to my sorrow\r\n    in 1833 or '34 before the machine was finished and nearly cut my\r\n    fingers off. I have the whole thing photographed in my mind and\r\n    can show the spot or within 10 feet of it where I lay on the\r\n    floor. It was not possible to try it in Maryland, owing to the\r\n    hilly nature of the ground, and was afterwards taken to Ohio for\r\n    trial and was rebuilt there, or at least a part of it, but of that\r\n    part (the rebuilding) I do not know for a certainty, but the bars,\r\n    fingers and knives I do most positively remember, as I was a lad\r\n    of some eight or nine years old with a mechanical turn of mind and\r\n    was looking into what seemed strange to me, hence I cut my finger\r\n    so bad that I carried the scar for a number of years. I very\r\n    distinctly remember the incomplete reaper made by my old friend,\r\n    Obed Hussey, as it was made in my grandfather's shop in Baltimore,\r\n    Maryland, who was at that time the leading plow-maker of the U. S.\r\n    and that it was made either in 1833 or '34, as I would not have\r\n    had a chance to see it if later than '34 as I was not at home\r\n    until '38, when it had been sent, as I was told, to Ohio for trial\r\n    and some parts had to be rebuilt.\r\n\r\n    \"Please excuse the liberty I have taken in writing to you, but I\r\n    could not resist the temptation to give my tribute to my old\r\n    friend, O. Hussey.\r\n\r\n    \"Very respectfully yours,\r\n\r\n    (Signed) \"W. H. CHENOWETH.\"\r\n\r\nThe machine referred to was, no doubt, the reaper completed and tested\r\nnear Cincinnati in the harvest of 1833.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The First Reaper]\r\n\r\nIt is not known when Mr. Hussey left the Chenoweth factory, but during\r\nthe winter of 1832-33 he was at Cincinnati working upon the reaper that,\r\nmore than else, won him lasting fame during the harvest of 1833. The\r\n\"Mechanics Magazine\" for April, 1834, contains an illustration of\r\n\"Hussey's Grain Cutter.\" The picture does not represent the model\r\ndeposited in the Patent Office with his application, for it differs in\r\nmany essentials from the drawing of the patent, which, of course,\r\ncorresponded with the model there filed. It has neither divider nor\r\nouter wheel, and the construction of the platform differs from that of\r\nhis regular machine. It is thought that the picture represents the small\r\nworking model made at the Chenoweth factory, mentioned by the little\r\ngirl.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Financing the First Reaper]\r\n\r\nMr. Hussey found one who took an interest in his invention and became so\r\nconfident of its value that he provided the necessary funds and\r\nmechanical facilities for manufacturing a reaper to be tested in the\r\nfield. This was Jarvis Reynolds of Cincinnati. Drawings were made of\r\nthe cutting apparatus and a description of it was sent by the inventor\r\nto a friend, Edwin G. Pratt, early in 1833.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Reaper Historian]\r\n\r\nAnother personal friend of Obed Hussey was Edward Stabler, who lived at\r\nSandy Hill, Maryland, and was, as he termed himself, \"a farmer and a\r\nmechanic.\" That he was a mechanic of ability is evidenced by government\r\nseals which were cut by him, that for the Smithsonian Institute being\r\nworthy of mention as an example of his skill. He was a postmaster from\r\nPresident Jackson's time until his own death. He is the only one who may\r\nbe said to have acted as Hussey's historian, and has left very much\r\nvaluable information in the form of letters, legal papers, et cetera. In\r\n1854 and '55 he published \"A Brief Narrative of the Invention of Reaping\r\nMachines,\" \"Hussey's Reaping Machine in England,\" and \"A Review of the\r\nPamphlet of W. N. P. Fitzgerald in Opposition to the Extension of the\r\nPatent of Obed Hussey; and also of the Defense, of Evidence in Favor of\r\nSaid Extention,\" etc. There is sufficient data obtainable from Mr.\r\nStabler's various publications and material in the Congressional Library\r\nto enable one to judge for himself whether the honors placed upon this\r\ninventor by the Patent Office, the Courts, by Congress, and by the\r\nfarmer were earned.\r\n\r\nIt was at the time Mr. Hussey was residing in Baltimore that he turned\r\nhis attention to the idea of a reaping machine and spent his leisure\r\nhours in working out his model. This satisfied him that the thing was\r\npractical, and he undertook an operating machine, which, although\r\nlightly made, was fully sufficient to test the great principle. At this\r\ntime he had no knowledge whether any others had undertaken anything in\r\nthis direction and there was nothing in his own mechanical occupation\r\nwhich would make him familiar with the subject.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: McCormick Claims Invention]\r\n\r\nAs the only other claimant for the honor of inventing the reaper was\r\nCyrus H. McCormick, reference is here made to a book entitled \"Memorial\r\nof Robert McCormick,\" the father of Cyrus H. McCormick, Leander J.\r\nMcCormick and William S. McCormick, published by the said Leander J.\r\nMcCormick in 1885, pages 44 to the bottom of page 51, also pages 58 to\r\n61 inclusive, from which I extract:\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Denial by Members of McCormick Family]\r\n\r\n\"Now, while we have no disposition to question the merits of the\r\nso-called McCormick harvester and binder, which, without doubt, is a\r\ngood machine,--though the judgment of foreigners as to its value is of\r\nno consequence,--we do assert that C. H. McCormick was not entitled to\r\nany of the honors showered upon him as its inventor. To be more\r\nexplicit, he not only did not invent the said machine, nor mechanically\r\nassist in the combinations of the inventions of others which produced\r\nit, but he never invented or produced any essential elementary part in\r\nany reaping or harvesting machine from the first to last. These\r\nassertions are broad, but absolutely true. They stand squarely upon the\r\nrecords and the history and state of the art. C. H. McCormick, or any\r\none for him, cannot deny them with proofs, therefore he is not entitled\r\nto recognition as the man who 'has done more to elevate agriculture than\r\nany man the world has produced,' because of his supposed inventions in\r\nthis line; but on the contrary, that the development of Western\r\nagriculture has elevated him, and that he has more money, and received\r\nmore honors, 'than any man the world has produced,' by appropriating the\r\nbrains of others, and the credit due them as inventors, are propositions\r\nmuch more defensible.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Their Affirmation of Hussey's Claim]\r\n\r\n\"But the man who is entitled to the most credit, as inventor and pioneer\r\nin this business, is Obed Hussey, who, December 31st, 1833, patented the\r\nmachine (successfully operated in previous harvest, well known and in\r\nuse since to this day), which combined all the main features--except the\r\nreel, which was then an old device--of practical reapers down to the\r\ntime, at least, when 'harvesters,' so-called, came into the field.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: (From An Old Print)]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The First Machine]\r\n\r\nThe following is also copied from \"Memorial of Robert McCormick,\"\r\npublished by Leander J. McCormick in 1885:\r\n\r\nTO THE CONGRESS OF THE UNITED STATES\r\n\r\n_\"REMONSTRANCE\"_\r\n\r\n\"Of the Citizens of New York against the renewal of Letters Patent\r\ngranted to Cyrus H. McCormick, June 21, 1834, for improvements in the\r\nReaping Machine.\r\n\r\n\"Among the early reaper inventors of this country, Mr. Obed Hussey, now\r\nof Baltimore, stood for many years deservedly the most prominent, and he\r\nhas doubtless by his genius and indefatigable exertions (although in a\r\nmodest way) contributed more to the advancement of this invention than\r\nany other man. He first tested his machine in 1833, and took out a\r\npatent for it the 31st of December of that year.\r\n\r\n\"He first constructed his machine with a reel to gather the grain up to\r\nthe cutters, and throw it upon the platform; but on trial, with his\r\ncutter, he thought it unnecessary and only an incumbrance, and,\r\ntherefore, threw it aside and has never used it since. The main\r\nframe-work containing the gearing was suspended on two wheels about\r\nthree feet four inches in diameter. The platform was attached to the\r\nrear of this frame, and extended out one side of it say six feet. The\r\nteam was attached to the front end of the frame and traveled at the side\r\nof the standing grain as in Randall's machine. The cutting apparatus was\r\npretty much the same as now used in Hussey's machine. The knife is\r\nconstructed of steel plates, riveted to a flat bar of iron. These plates\r\nare three inches broad at the end where they are riveted to the bar, and\r\nfour and a half inches long, projecting in front, and tapering nearly to\r\na point, forming what is described as a saw with very coarse teeth,\r\nwhich are sharp on both edges. This cutter is supported on what he terms\r\nguards, which are attached to the front edge of the platform or\r\ncutter-bar (as termed by Hussey), one every three inches the whole width\r\nof the machine, projecting horizontally in front about six or eight\r\ninches. These guards have long slots through them horizontally through\r\nwhich the cutter vibrates, and thus form a support for the grain whilst\r\nit is cut, and protect the cutter from liability to injury from large\r\nstones and other obstructions. The cutter is attached by means of a\r\npitman rod to a crank, which is put in motion by gearing connecting with\r\none or both of the ground wheels as may be desired, according to\r\ncircumstances, which gives to the cutter as the machine advances, a\r\nquick vibrating motion; and each point of the cutter vibrates from the\r\ncentre of one guard, through the space between, to the centre of the\r\nnext, thus cutting equally both ways. As the machine advances, the grain\r\nis readily cut, and the butts are carried along with the machine which\r\ncauses the tops to fall back upon the platform without the aid of the\r\nreel. The grain to be cut was separated from that to be left standing by\r\nmeans of a point projecting in front of the cutter, in the form of a\r\nwedge, bearing the grain both inwards and outwards, with a board set\r\nedgewise upon it, sloping downwards, to a point in front. The grain was\r\nraked from the machine by a man riding upon it, in rear of the frame, at\r\nthe side of the cutter, nearly in range with the guards, with his back\r\ntowards the team, sometimes at the side and sometimes behind the\r\nplatform. Soon after this date Mr. Hussey changed the construction of\r\nhis machine somewhat, used one large ground wheel instead of two, placed\r\nthe platform alongside the frame, and placed his raker on a seat by the\r\nside of the large ground wheel, facing the team, and raked the grain off\r\nin rear of the platform.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Most Practical]\r\n\r\n\"This was for many years doubtless the most practical reaping machine\r\nknown, and, with the improvements that have been made upon it, from time\r\nto time, it is now preferred to any other in many wheat growing sections\r\nof the country.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Mr. Hussey's Plea]\r\n\r\nThe fact and intensity of Mr. Hussey's struggles may, in part, be\r\ngathered from his letter to Edward Stabler, dated March 12, 1854:\r\n\r\n    \"Baltimore, March 12, 1854.\r\n\r\n    \"My Esteemed Friend, Edward Stabler:--\r\n\r\n    \"I think the work goes bravely on. I am unable to express my\r\n    estimation of thy disinterested efforts; I never before\r\n    experienced anything of the kind; it seems entirely new to me to\r\n    have any one go out of their way so much, to do so much for me. I\r\n    am not so much surprised at the progress thee makes considering\r\n    the man, as I am that any man could be found to do me such a\r\n    service. I hope thee will not get weary; I am sure thee will not.\r\n    I hope the Committee will not act so unjustly as to turn their\r\n    backs on all cases because there is 'rascality' in some; because\r\n    there is rascality in some cases, why should a just cause suffer?\r\n    The facts in my case can be easily proved. I made no money during\r\n    the existence of my patent, or I might say I made less than I\r\n    would have made if I had held an under-clerk's position in the\r\n    Patent Office; I would have been better off at the end of the 14\r\n    years if I had filled exactly such station as my foreman holds,\r\n    and got his pay, and would not have had half the hard work, nor a\r\n    hundredth part of the heart-aching. I never experienced half the\r\n    fatigue in rowing after a whale in the Pacific Ocean (which I have\r\n    often done) as I experienced year after year for eighteen years in\r\n    the harvest field, I might say twenty years, for I worked as hard\r\n    in England as I do at home, for in the harvest, wherever I am\r\n    there is no rest for me. If I am guilty of no rascality why should\r\n    I not be compensated for toiling to introduce an invention which I\r\n    thought to be of so much advantage to the World. I know I was the\r\n    _first_ one who successfully accomplished the cutting of\r\n    grain and grass by machinery. If others _tried_ to do it\r\n    before me it was not _doing_ it; being the first who ever did\r\n    it, why should I be obliged to suffer and toil most, and get the\r\n    least by it? No man knows how much I have suffered in body and\r\n    mind since 1833, on account of this thing, the first year I\r\n    operated it in Balto. Three years after I cut the first crop, I\r\n    could not go to meeting for many weeks for want of a _decent\r\n    coat_, while for economy I made my own coffee and eat, slept in\r\n    my shop, until I had sold machines enough to be able to do better;\r\n    there was no rascality in all that. My machines then cost me\r\n    nearly all I got for them when counting moderate wages for my own\r\n    labour. The Quaker who lent me the ninety dollars ten years\r\n    afterward would not then (ten years before) trust me for iron, one\r\n    who was not a Quaker did. There is one thing not generally\r\n    understood; thou will remember the trial at Lloyd's, thou\r\n    remembers also that I received the purse of 100 dollars; now what\r\n    would the world suppose I would do? Why that I would do like the\r\n    flour holders, _keep the price up_! But it is a fact and can\r\n    be proved, that after it was announced to me that the verdict was\r\n    in my favor I said to a gentleman _now I will reduce my price 10\r\n    dollars_, on each machine, _and I did it_, from that hour\r\n    and did not breathe my intention until after that decision was\r\n    announced to me! Where is the man who has done the like under\r\n    similar circumstances? There is no 'rascality' in that. Now I do\r\n    not believe that there is a reaper in the country (which is good\r\n    for anything) at so low a price as mine, and not one on which so\r\n    little profit is made.\r\n\r\n    \"I will inclose a pamphlet which I suppose thee has already\r\n    seen--it may be useful.\r\n\r\n    \"Thy friend,\r\n\r\n    (Signed) \"OBED HUSSEY.\"\r\n\r\nMr. William N. Whitely, an early inventor and manufacturer of harvesting\r\nmachinery, who was for many years the king of the reaper business, and\r\nwho fought the Hussey extension \"tooth and nail,\" on January 8, 1897,\r\nwrote to the \"Farm Implement News\" upon the subject of McCormick's\r\nportrait on the silver certificates, then about to be issued, in which\r\nhe refers also to Mr. Hussey, as follows:\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: From the Pen of a Hussey Opponent]\r\n\r\n\"Editor 'Farm Implement News':\r\n\r\n\"Having been informed that the bureau of engraving and printing was\r\npreparing new $10 silver certificates to be ornamented by the busts of\r\nWhitney, the inventor of the cotton gin, and C. H. McCormick, 'inventor\r\nof the reaper,' I write you to say that it would manifestly be unjust to\r\ncredit the invention of the reaper to any one man. Mr. McCormick does\r\ndeserve great credit for his _enterprise_ and _business skill_\r\nin the many years he was engaged in manufacturing harvesting machinery\r\nand we are pleased to honor his memory; yet so much has been done in\r\nbringing the reaper to its present state of perfection by the many\r\nthousands of inventors that our government would make a mistake in\r\nsingling out Mr. McCormick from the many _meritorious_ ones who\r\nhave contributed so much to the reaper of the past and of the present\r\nday. We well understand that no effort has been spared for many years\r\npast in keeping C. H. McCormick before the American people as the\r\ninventor of the reaper by his immediate relatives and friends, and we\r\nhave no right to find fault with such a course upon their part; but when\r\nthe great government of the United States of America proposes to certify\r\nby the above mentioned course to the correctness of the claims made for\r\nC.

McCormick as the inventor of the reaper, to the disparagement of\r\nso many other _worthy_ inventors and co-workers upon the reaper,\r\nthen those who know better should raise their voices against such an\r\nattempted recognition for any one man, of whom the best that can be said\r\nis that he was only one of the many.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Reaper Itself Mr. Hussey's Contribution]\r\n\r\n\"From 1831 to 1834, and for several years thereafter, two persons, i.e.,\r\nObed Hussey and C. H. McCormick, were striving to produce a successful\r\nreaping machine for cutting grain and grass, as were many others, before\r\nand since. These two men were contemporaneously in the field, and no\r\ndoubt they both labored faithfully to accomplish the desired result. The\r\ninvention of Obed Hussey, the features of which were embraced in his\r\nfirst machine in 1832 and 1833, included all the principles of a\r\npractical reaper. It was a side draft or side cut machine; that is, the\r\ncutting apparatus extended out to one side, the animals drawing the\r\nmachine moving along by the side of the grain or grass to be cut. It had\r\ntwo driving and supporting wheels, gearing extending rearward with a\r\ncrank and pitman therefrom to reciprocate the cutters, which were\r\nscalloped or projecting blades from a bar and vibrated through slotted\r\nguard fingers which held the stalks to be cut. The cutting apparatus was\r\nhinged to the side of the frame of the machine to enable it to follow\r\nthe surface of the ground over which the machine was passing. A platform\r\nwas supported by an outer and inner wheel. The operator was seated upon\r\nthe machine and raked the grain into sheaves from the platform as it was\r\ncut. Over sixty years have come and gone, yet all the essential features\r\nof the first Hussey machine and all Hussey machines made thereafter\r\n(which were large numbers) employed substantially these devices. The\r\nmachine was successful the first time it was completed, and ever after\r\nwere the Hussey machines successful in harvesting grain and grass. The\r\nfundamental principles of all harvesting machinery of the world to-day\r\nwere furnished by Obed Hussey's invention and patent of 1833; and while\r\nvery many and valuable improvements have been made thereon for\r\nharvesting grain and grass, for which credit should be given to the\r\nworthy inventors who followed after Hussey, yet we must not ignore his\r\nvaluable contribution, '_the reaper_.'\r\n\r\n\"Cyrus H. McCormick's first patent was dated in 1834. This was known as\r\na push machine with a straight cutter, the operator walking by the side\r\nof the machine and raking the grain from the platform. Other\r\nmodifications in after years were made on this machine by Mr. McCormick;\r\nand it may be said that the inventive genius of Obed Hussey and the\r\nbusiness tact and skill of C. H. McCormick produced and brought into\r\npractical use the first successful reaping machine of this or any other\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Whose Machine Still Lives?]\r\n\r\n\"Whatever might have been embodied in the first McCormick machine or in\r\nhis experiments or machines for the first fifteen years of his efforts,\r\nthe _reaper of the present day does not disclose any principles_\r\ncontained in these early efforts of C. H. McCormick; but that cannot be\r\nsaid of Hussey. _All_ reaping machines of the present day embody\r\nsubstantially _all_ of the vital principles given by Obed Hussey in\r\n1833 and at different periods thereafter. The Patent Office, as well as\r\nother sources of information, make good these statements.\r\n\r\n\"Passing, however, from the early history up to the present time, when\r\nthe present mowing machines and grain binding machines are seen in\r\noperation, and taking into account the thousands of patents that have\r\nbeen issued to American inventors for various features that they have\r\nbrought out, it would be but simple justice that all be recognized as\r\ncontributors to the building up of such valuable and important pieces of\r\nmachinery; and I cannot but repeat that it would be very unjust, unfair\r\nand un-American to single out one person, and that one Mr. McCormick, as\r\na representative to be used by the government printing bureau, when it\r\nis so well known what he did and what he did not do in the invention of\r\nthe reaper. It would be a false monument; it would only be respected by\r\npersons who are ignorant of the facts.\r\n\r\n\"If this should succeed, it would not be the first time, as likely it\r\nwill not be the last time, in the history of mankind where those who did\r\nthe work were soon forgotten and those who were more fortunate in being\r\nheld up and prominently kept before the public by their friends or\r\npowerful allies received unjustly the credit.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Early Ventures in Manufacture]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: An Unfortunate Delay]\r\n\r\nIt will be seen from the foregoing extracts that Mr. Hussey's machines\r\nwent early into the field in such quantities as he and other little\r\nmanufacturers throughout the country, some of whom ignored the exclusive\r\nrights granted him, could put them out. They were simple, and a few\r\ncastings were all that was necessary, except lumber, which was plenty in\r\nthe forests of the East and in the groves of the West, to enable a\r\ncountry wagon maker and blacksmith to put machines into the field. Many\r\nof the earlier inventors, who began the manufacture of reapers of their\r\nown invention, followed that course and castings were sometimes brought\r\nfrom great distances. Mr. Hussey applied for an extension of his 1833\r\npatent, but, not knowing the exact requirements, his application was\r\noffered too late, sixty days before the expiration of the patent being\r\nthe time allotted. Knowing, we presume, but little about law, and still\r\nless about \"the rules and regulations of the Patent Office\"--for all his\r\ntime, and constant labor with his own hands, were required in the\r\nworkshop to earn a bare support,--but being very desirous to obtain an\r\nextension of his Patent before it should expire, and also having some\r\npersonal acquaintance with Commissioner Ellsworth, Hussey's first\r\napplication was made to him in 1845, a short time previous to his going\r\nout of office; certainly not less than twelve months before the\r\nexpiration. This is proved by the annexed letter:\r\n\r\n    \"La Fayette, Ia., July 3, 1854.\r\n\r\n    \"Dear Sir:--\r\n\r\n    \"Your letter of some weeks since, referring to a conversation I\r\n    had with you while I was Commissioner of Patents, relative to the\r\n    extention of your patent for a Reaper, would have been answered\r\n    earlier, but for absence and extreme pressure of business.\"\r\n\r\n    \"If my recollection will aid you, I most cheerfully state, that\r\n    before your patent expired, you consulted me as to the extension\r\n    of the same. I replied that it was better to postpone an\r\n    application until near the time the patent would run out, for the\r\n    Office must estimate the profits of the invention during the whole\r\n    term; and you accordingly postponed it. I regret you postponed it\r\n    too long. The publication of thirty days before the patent\r\n    expired, was a rule as published by myself. If you have lost your\r\n    opportunity for relief through (the) Patent Office, you must of\r\n    course go to Congress. I have always regarded your improvement as\r\n    valuable, and that the country is greatly indebted to your\r\n    persevering efforts, notwithstanding the obstacles presented.\r\n\r\n    \"Yours respectfully,\r\n\r\n    \"HENRY L. ELLSWORTH.\r\n\r\n    \"Mr. Obed Hussey, Balto., Md.\"\r\n\r\nHussey acted on this official advice, and did \"postpone an application\r\nuntil near the time the patent would run out\"--literally so, for he was\r\nnot advised of even the \"thirty days' rule.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Why Mr. Hussey's Application Was Late]\r\n\r\nWhen he again applied, and not \"until near the time the patent would run\r\nout,\" Edmund Burke was Commissioner of Patents. He states in a letter to\r\nSenators Douglas and Shields, under date March 4th, 1850, as follows:\r\n\r\n\"In relation to the patent of Hussey, if my memory serves me, his patent\r\nexpired some time within the latter part of December, 1847. During that\r\nmonth, and within some ten or twelve days before the expiration of his\r\npatent, he applied to me as Commissioner of Patents for an extension. I\r\ninformed him, that inasmuch as the act of Congress prescribed the mode\r\nin which patents should be extended; required a reasonable notice to be\r\ngiven to the public in sundry newspapers, published in those parts of\r\nthe country most interested against such extension; and as the board had\r\ndecided that 'reasonable' notice should be a publication of the\r\napplication for extension three weeks prior to the day appointed for the\r\nhearing, there was not time to give the required notice in his case; and\r\nI advised Mr. Hussey not to make his application, and thus lose the fee\r\nof $40 required in such cases, as he inevitably would, without the least\r\nprospect of succeeding in his application--but to petition Congress for\r\nan extension, which body had the power to grant it.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: An Able and Unanswerable Report]\r\n\r\n    \"Washington, 5th Sept., 1854.\r\n\r\n    \"Obed Hussey, Esq., Baltimore:--\r\n\r\n    \"My Dear Sir: I have recently learned, with surprise and indignation,\r\n    that certain speculating harpies who fill their coffers with the\r\n    products of other men's brains, and who, in your case, seek to 'reap\r\n    where they sow not' are basely and unjustly endeavoring to prevent\r\n    a renewal of your patent for your Reaping and Mowing Machine,' upon\r\n    the ground [among others] that you and your agents have neglected to\r\n    press your Claim properly before Congress.\r\n\r\n    \"I have been your Agent from the time the claim was first presented\r\n    to Congress, and know that the Charge is entirely unfounded.\r\n\r\n    \"The facts according to the best of my recollection and belief, are\r\n    as follows: Your Claim for a renewal was presented to Congress at the\r\n    very first Session, after you ascertained that your application to the\r\n    Commissioner could not be acted upon under the rules of the Patent\r\n    Office. Every paper and proof necessary to establish your right to a\r\n    renewal of your patent, under the existing laws, was procured, and\r\n    promptly placed with your memorial, before Congress. No further proof\r\n    was required by the Committee on Patents, in the Senate, and your\r\n    right to a renewal was fully established by an able and unanswerable\r\n    report of that Committee, accompanied by a bill for a renewal. This\r\n    report and bill were printed by order of the Senate, and were noticed\r\n    as a part of the proceedings of Congress, by the press throughout the\r\n    United States, and every body thus notified of your application.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Mr. Hussey's Methods]\r\n\r\n    \"From that period to the present time, I do not think there has been\r\n    a single Congress at which all proper efforts were not made to\r\n    obtain the action of that Body. Members were not annoyed with\r\n    indecent importunity; nor were any powerful combinations of\r\n    interested individuals resorted to, to force your Claim upon the\r\n    consideration of Congress. This was not in accordance with your\r\n    taste, or your means. I well remember, however, that you frequently\r\n    visited this City on that business; and that at almost every\r\n    session, you either brought or sent to me, to be laid before\r\n    Congress, some new evidence of the triumph of your great invention.\r\n    These documents were faithfully laid before that body, or sent to\r\n    the senators from Maryland for that purpose. On one occasion, as\r\n    your agent, I addressed a somewhat extended communication to the\r\n    Senators from Maryland, attempting to show the vast importance of\r\n    your invention to the Agricultural interests of the United States,\r\n    and the strong claims you had to a renewal of your patent, and\r\n    requested them as the Representatives of your State in the Senate,\r\n    to give their attention and influence to accomplish that end.\r\n\r\n    \"At a subsequent Session, this request was repeated, to one or both\r\n    of the Senators from that State.\r\n\r\n    \"I can also state with certainty that hardly a Session of Congress\r\n    has passed since your memorial was first presented, at which\r\n    prominent and Scientific Agriculturalists, in different parts of the\r\n    Country, who were acquainted with the merits of your invention, have\r\n    not used their influence with Members of Congress to obtain a\r\n    renewal of your patent. Any pretense, therefore, that your Claim has\r\n    not been duly presented, notified to the public, and urged with all\r\n    proper care and diligence upon the attention of Congress, I repeat\r\n    is totally unfounded.\r\n\r\n    \"It will be a stain upon the justice of the Country, if one whom\r\n    truth and time must rank among its greatest Benefactors, shall be\r\n    stricken down and permitted to die in indigence by the interested\r\n    and unworthy efforts thus made to defeat you.\r\n\r\n    \"You are at liberty to use this statement in any manner you may\r\n    desire.\r\n\r\n    \"Very truly and respectfully,\r\n\r\n    \"Your Ob't Ser'vt,\r\n\r\n    \"CHA'S E. SHERMAN.\"\r\n\r\nAlthough not coming in the natural order of events, I quote from an\r\nenclosure found in a letter written to Hon. H. May, evidently a member\r\nof Congress. Mr. Hussey having failed to apply for an extension of his\r\n1833 patent early enough, a bill was introduced in Congress with an\r\nextension in view. In some correspondence between Mr. Hussey and the\r\nHon. H. May an enclosure is found reading as follows:\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Mr. Hussey's Defense]\r\n\r\n\"During the examination of my case in the Committee-room on the 21st\r\ninst. you asked me a question, and accompanied it with a remark to the\r\neffect 'Why could I not raise a company in Baltimore with sufficient\r\ncapital and make as many machines as Howard & Co. and compete with them\r\non equal ground? The excitement of the occasion disqualified me for\r\ngiving a full reply to your question and remarks. I was at the time so\r\nimpressed with the injustice and the great hardship of being compelled\r\nto compete with the world for what of right belonged to myself\r\nexclusively that I had not the words to express my feelings. Could any\r\ngentleman look back twenty-one years and see me combating the prejudices\r\nof the farmers, and exerting the most intense labor of body and mind,\r\nand continuing to do so from year to year, at the very door of poverty,\r\nand also look back on those New York parties through the same period,\r\naccumulating wealth by the usual course of business, and perhaps\r\nwatching my progress, and waiting for the proper moment to step in with\r\ntheir money power and grasp the lion's share of the prize which justly\r\nbelongs to myself. If they could look back on the circumstances and\r\ncomprehend the case in all its reality and truth I should have no fear\r\nof a just decision by the Committee in the House of Representatives. The\r\nGovernment which can tolerate and uphold such a state of things would\r\nappear to me to be a hard Government.\r\n\r\n\"The end and design of the Patent Laws was to reward the inventor for a\r\nvaluable invention by giving him the exclusive right to make and vend\r\nthe article which he had invented and fourteen years was deemed a\r\nsufficient time in which to secure that reward. The telegraph was\r\nperfect on its first trial. It required no improvement. On the contrary,\r\nhalf the wire was dispensed with. The Government was at the cost of\r\ntrying the experiment and has since heaped wealth on the inventor. My\r\nfourteen years were required in perfecting my invention without any\r\nreturn for time and labor. (The finishing touch to his cutting apparatus\r\nis, no doubt here referred to, and shown in his patent of 1847.)\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Mr. Hussey's Protest]\r\n\r\n\"Public opinion on the subject of valuable inventions is liberal until\r\nan obscure individual appears in the community claiming the reward for a\r\nvaluable invention; the disposition then seems to be to let him shrink\r\ninto a corner. The world has got the advantage of his labors and has no\r\nfurther use for him; every unreasonable man in the community will at\r\nonce claim an equal right with the inventor of the device and one not\r\ncontent to urge their claims by misrepresentation but must heap abuses\r\non the poor inventor who they have in a great measure pushed out of\r\ntheir way. The idea that a wise Government, of an enlightened country,\r\ncan not only look on and suffer such injustice but will actually\r\nencourage it by disregarding the prayers of the poor inventor is a\r\nmystery to those who build their hopes on the dogma that '_Truth is\r\nmighty and will prevail_.' I hope the Committee will not pass lightly\r\nover my case but duly consider, as I believe they will, to whom the\r\nadvantages of this invention belongs, whether to me or to the parties in\r\nNew York. My chief aim in addressing this to you is to endeavor to draw\r\na parallel between myself and the parties in New York, and thereby\r\nsecure your good opinion in my favor.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Farmers Using Hussey Reaper]\r\n\r\nEdward Stabler, on January 11, 1854, wrote to Hon. Henry May as follows:\r\n\r\n\"As requested I have examined the petitions of the 450 farmers who\r\nadvocate the extension of Hussey's patent and from a personal\r\nacquaintance or by character with much larger portion in Delaware,\r\nMaryland, Virginia, and North Carolina, and on reliable information of\r\nthose from New York--234 in number--I am satisfied that they are\r\nwheat-growers to an amount of not less than from four to 500,000 bushels\r\nannually. * * * They used Hussey's reaper, and some of them three and\r\nfour, or more of these great labor-saving implements.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Edward Stabler writes to Henry May, under date March 19, 1854:\r\n\r\n\"The most that I fear is that Hussey's interests (which all appear\r\nwilling to admit is a meritorious case) may suffer in the contests that\r\nI am satisfied will take place with regard to Moore & Haskell's and\r\nMcCormick's extensions. I should be greatly pleased, and have stronger\r\nhopes if Hussey's case could be acted on promptly and before that\r\ncontest begins.\r\n\r\n\"On the ground of its having been so long and so favorably reported on,\r\nby the Senate's Committee in '48--six years next May, possibly it could\r\nbe called up at an earlier date,--the sooner the better, to avoid\r\ncompetition from interested parties, and which I certainly anticipate if\r\nlong delayed in either House of Congress. Honestly believing the cause\r\njust and right, for no fee, however large, could tempt me to advocate\r\nwhat I thought unjust or wrong, I shall persevere as long as there is\r\nground for hope. If we fail I shall have pleasing reflections, doing\r\nunto others as you would that they under similar circumstances should do\r\nunto you.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Edward Stabler, on February 5, 1854, wrote to J. A. Pierce, member of\r\none of the Committees, a letter from which the following is extracted:\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Mr. Hussey's Character and Service]\r\n\r\n\"I will, however, preface my remarks by saying that I have no connection\r\nwhatever with his business operations nor pecuniary interest in his\r\naffairs, but being well acquainted with him I am free to say, that I\r\nhave known no man on whose word I have placed more implicit reliance, no\r\none more honestly entitled to what he asks for.\r\n\r\n\"He has faithfully devoted the prime of his life, and no small portion\r\nof it either, in the invention and the perfecting of the reaping and\r\nmowing machine; and his untiring perseverance has certainly been crowned\r\nwith success so far as to confer a signal and lasting benefit on his\r\ncountry; but unfortunately he has derived no corresponding advantage for\r\nhimself, and from no fault on his part.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Opinion of an Able Mechanic]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Mr. Stabler's Testimony]\r\n\r\n\"While C. H. McCormick has literally fattened on the agricultural public\r\nby the sale of his inferior and cheaply made machines--for such I do\r\nconsider them, both from my own observations and the report to me by\r\nthose who have been induced to purchase them--Hussey has been pirated on\r\nfrom all quarters, and others reaping the reward of his labors. And I\r\nperceive by the papers on file, and accompanying the printed report (No.\r\n16) that this same C. H. McCormick has actually petitioned against the\r\nrenewal of Hussey's patent. It is really a very hard case, that a poor\r\nman and one of the most deserving in the community in every sense of the\r\nterm, should thus fail of a just reward when he has done so much for the\r\nbenefit of others. * * * Believing as I do that the extension is no more\r\nthan sheer justice to Obed Hussey,--quite equal in merit to any that has\r\nbeen granted,--as one of the _most meritorious_ in the language of\r\nthe Committee, I do most earnestly solicit thy kind aid and influence to\r\nget it through the Senate. * * * He was then (and still is) a comparatively\r\npoor man; without the means from his limited sales to extend his business\r\nin a profitable manner or to protect his known and acknowledged rights\r\nfrom the depredations of others. His shops--and I speak from personal\r\nknowledge--are for the most part dilapidated sheds--too confined and\r\ncramped up to do any part of his work to the best advantage, and from a\r\npersonal knowledge speaking as a practical machinist of some 25 years\r\nexperience, I do know that his profits are far less than some other\r\nmachine makers--not the half of what is usually supposed.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Two Machines Compared]\r\n\r\n\"Take, for example, the machines as usually made by Obed Hussey and C. H.\r\nMcCormick--for I am familiar with both; owing to the quality of the work,\r\ncosts of material and arrangement of the mechanism, _two_ of McCormick's\r\ncan be made by him for little or no more than the cost to Hussey of _one_\r\nof his. Such, too, is the statement on oath of competent men employed by\r\nboth manufacturers. McCormick's foreman and clerk have sworn (see\r\npetition from New York against his extension) that his machines are made\r\nfor some $35 to $40 each. Any man who will undertake to make and sell\r\nHussey machines as he makes them for much less than double this sum, will\r\nsoon beg his bread if he depends on his profits to buy it, unless he\r\n_cheats_ his hands out of _their_ part.\"\r\n\r\nA postscript is added, which reads:\r\n\r\n\"I should have made no allusion to C. H. McCormick or to his machines,\r\nhad he not volunteered by petition to injure his rival--in my opinion a\r\nmost worthy, reliable and deserving man--and I would add that in my\r\nestimation the two machines differ just about as widely as the two men.\"\r\n\r\nWe may assume that Mr. Hussey must have begun on his large machine late\r\nin 1832, or early in 1833, at latest. During the early part of the\r\nharvest of 1833 he was in the field. \"The machine was started,\" Stabler\r\ntells us, \"but owing to some part giving way, or some slight defect not\r\napparent until then, it at first failed to work satisfactorily. One\r\nburly fellow present picked up a reaping cradle and, swinging it with an\r\nair of great exultation, exclaimed, 'This is the machine to cut the\r\nwheat!'\" Another account charges the breakage to a fractious team.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Mr. Hussey's Triumph]\r\n\r\n\"After the jeers and merriment of the crowd had somewhat subsided, the\r\ninventor remedied the defect, and assisted by the laborers present--the\r\nhorses having been removed--pulled the machine to the top of an adjacent\r\nhill; when, alone, he drew the machine down the hill and through the\r\nstanding grain, when it cut every head clean in its track. The same\r\nmachine was directly afterwards exhibited before the Hamilton County\r\nAgricultural Society near Carthage, on the 2nd day of July, 1833.\"\r\n\r\nThe secretary of the Society wrote an exceedingly favorable report. The\r\ngroup of spectators present at this trial drew up a testimonial that was\r\nvery favorable indeed. On July 2, 1833, then, we are warranted in\r\nsaying, the problem that had so long exercised the minds of inventors\r\nwas solved.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Hussey Reaper in the Field]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Public Tests]\r\n\r\nFortunately Mr. Hussey was not as easily discouraged as many. He, no\r\ndoubt, felt chagrined that his machine had broken down, but had the\r\npluck then and there to make an effort to close the hooting mouths, and\r\nfully succeeded. In 1834 other machines were put out. We learn from the\r\nGenesee Farmer, dated December 6, 1834, that Mr. Hussey, the inventor of\r\na machine for harvesting wheat, had left in the village one of his\r\nmachines for the purpose of giving the farmers an opportunity to test\r\nits value. During the harvest of 1834 it was operated in the presence of\r\nhundreds of farmers with most satisfactory results. We next find Mr.\r\nHussey at Palmyra, Mo., on July 6, 1835, with two of his machines, at\r\nthe farm of his old friend, Edwin G. Pratt. The machine \"excited much\r\nattention, and its performance was highly satisfactory.\" The results of\r\nthe trials were published in the \"Missouri Courrier\" in August or\r\nSeptember of 1835. The machines were sold for $150 each. A Mr. Muldrow\r\nbought another kind of machine, however, in which the cutting was done\r\nby a \"whirling wheel\" and paid $500 for it. In 1836 Mr. Hussey was in\r\nMaryland, at the written solicitation of the Board of Trustees of the\r\nMaryland Agricultural Society. The fame of his reaping machines in the\r\nstate of New York, and the far West, had spread, \"though with something\r\nlike a snail's pace,\" as new things did two-thirds of a century ago. The\r\nmachine was operated at Oxford, Talbot County, on the 1st of July, in\r\nthe presence of the Board and a considerable number of other gentlemen.\r\nIts performance was perfect, as it cut every spear of grain, collected\r\nit in bunches of the proper size for sheaves and laid it straight and\r\neven for the binder. On the 12th of July a public exhibition was made at\r\nEaston, under the direction of the Board; several hundred persons,\r\nprincipally farmers, being present. This same machine was sold to Mr.\r\nTench Tilghman, for whom it cut 180 acres of wheat, oats and barley\r\nduring that season. The report of the Board of Trustees of the Maryland\r\nAgricultural Society stated that \"three mules of medium size worked in\r\nit constantly with as much ease as in a drag harrow. They moved with\r\nequal facility in a walk or trot.\" In 1837 the machines were sold in\r\nvarious parts of the country. One at Hornewood, Md., one at West River,\r\nand several others throughout the state. One of the machines sold in\r\n1838 to the St. George's and Appoquinomick Ag. Society cut several\r\nhundred acres of grain, up to 1845, and was then in good repair. In all\r\nthis time the cost for repairs was only 1-1/4c per acre. The popularity\r\nof the machine became so pronounced that other inventors were given\r\ncourage, and those who before had failed were prompted to pick up their\r\nwork where they had dropped it or begin on newer lines.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Silver medal awarded to Mr. Hussey for the Reaper at\r\nBaltimore in 1845.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A Hussey-McCormick Contest]\r\n\r\nIn 1843 we find that Hussey's machine was in a field-contest with one\r\nbrought in by Cyrus H. McCormick of Rockbridge County, Va. We say\r\nbrought in, because the claim that it was in fact invented and made by\r\n_Robert McCormick_ seems to be quite well founded. (Memorial of\r\nRobert McCormick.) The contest took place on the farm of a Mr.\r\nHutchinson, about four miles above the city of Richmond. Mr. Hussey had,\r\nfor a number of years, been building two sizes of machines, and at the\r\nfirst day's trial was obliged to use a small one because his only large\r\nmachine within reach was elsewhere occupied. The majority of the\r\nself-appointed committee of bystanders reported in favor of McCormick's\r\nmachine, but Mr. Roane, one of them, who signed very reluctantly, later\r\nbought a Hussey machine. A few days after, at Tree Hill, Mr. Hussey was\r\npresent with his large machine.\r\n\r\nIn the \"American Farmer\" was soon after published a letter from Mr.\r\nRoane, dated January 23, 1844, to Mr. Hussey, in which, among other\r\nthings, he says:\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Mr. Roane's Letter]\r\n\r\n\"Averse as I am to having my name in print on _this_, or any other\r\noccasion, I cannot with propriety decline a response to your inquiry. I\r\nhad never seen or formed an idea of a reaping machine until I went to\r\nHutchinson's. I was surprised and delighted with the performance of each\r\nof them, and fully resolved to own one of them by the _next_ harvest, but\r\ntheir performance that day left me in a state of doubt which I should\r\nselect. The report spoke in terms of high praise of each machine, and I\r\nconsented to its award, that on the whole Mr. McCormick's was preferable,\r\nmerely because being the cheapest, and requiring but two horses, it would\r\nbest suit the majority of our farmers, who make small crops of wheat on\r\n_weak land_, for I doubted its capacity in _heavy_ grain. After this\r\nreport was made I heard your complaint that you did not have a fair\r\ntrial, because being unable to bring into the field your large improved\r\nreaper, which was up the river, you were compelled to comply with your\r\n_engagement_ for the day, with a _small_ and _inferior_ machine, drawn\r\nby an indifferent and untutored team. Mr. Hutchinson's wheat was badly\r\nrusted, and therefore light. I had ready for the scythe a low ground\r\nfield of heavy and well matured grain; partly to expedite my harvest\r\nwork, and partly to renew the trial, that I might solve my doubts as to\r\nthe merits of these machines, I succeeded in engaging them to be at\r\nTree Hill on a named day. They both came agreeable to appointment, Mr.\r\nMcCormick bringing the machine he used at Hutchinson's, and you bringing\r\nthe one you could not on that occasion bring down the river. The day was\r\nfine, and both machines did their best, and had a very fair trial. My\r\ndoubts were fully removed, and my mind convinced that in the heavy wheat\r\nwe raise on our river low grounds, rich bottoms, etc. _your_ machine is\r\nsuperior to Mr. McCormick's of which I still think highly. I accordingly\r\nordered one of yours to be made for the approaching harvest.\r\n\r\n\"I wish you all possible success in cutting hemp in the 'Great West.' It\r\nmust be very desirable to cut that valuable plant instead of pulling it\r\nup by the roots, and I cannot doubt that your reaper has _ample_ power\r\nfor the purpose.\" (Records of U.S. Patent Office.)\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Mr. Hussey Not a Business Man]\r\n\r\nNo one will claim that Mr. Hussey was what may be termed a good business\r\nman; like most inventors, his mind was on what he sought to accomplish\r\nrather than on the hoarding of wealth. I have already quoted from\r\ncorrespondence that passed between him and his friends, when attempting\r\nto get his 1833 patent extended.\r\n\r\nAn early manufacturer, well known to Mr. Hussey and who paid royalties\r\nunder Mr. Hussey's patents, writes:\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Hussey's early machines were made by Jarvis Reynolds of Cincinnati,\r\nOhio,\" we are informed by Mr. William N. Whitely, who early became\r\nfamiliar with many of the facts, he having opposed Hussey's extension\r\napplication, \"in a shop on the river front, beginning in 1831 or '32.\r\nAfter making that operated in 1833 he built several others during two or\r\nthree years or more. Some of the early ones were taken to Glendale,\r\nOhio, to the farm of Algernon Foster.\"\r\n\r\n\"The first machine taken there had a reel on it, but after using it a\r\nshort time the reel was laid aside. On the same machine was an extra\r\nplatform, attached to the rear, so that the raker could deliver the\r\ngrain to one side. The machines were intended for both reaping and\r\nmowing.\" Mr. Whitely states that he saw two of the machines still on Mr.\r\nFoster's farm in 1860, that had been there since, probably, 1835.\r\n\r\n\"The machines were at first bought by farmers who did cutting for the\r\nneighbors and under the circumstances were anxious to prostrate as many\r\nacres of grain per day as possible; in order to accomplish this, they\r\napplied four horses and moved on a 'jog trot.' So moving the reel was\r\nfound of little service because the rapidly moving machine caused the\r\nsevered straws to fall backward on the platform so that the raker had\r\nlittle to do but to remove it, except where it was particularly badly\r\nlodged; in such cases he manipulated his rake as it is now used on all\r\nreelless reaping machines.\"\r\n\r\nAfter building the machines for Algernon Foster, Mr. Hussey undertook\r\nthe manufacture of two or more machines for the harvest of 1835. From a\r\nletter received from John Lane, we quote:\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A Contract]\r\n\r\n\"'Old Judge Foster' was a well known jurist and judge of court in\r\nHamilton County, Ohio, having his country home (a farm) 3-1/2 miles near\r\ndue east from my father's place of business, and it was he who\r\nintroduced Obed Hussey to John Lane as being a mechanic who could and\r\nwould make for him the reaper he was at that time seeking to have made\r\nin Cincinnati. Also it was agreed between said Hussey and Foster that\r\nwhen said reaper had been made and tested to their satisfaction in the\r\nstanding grains, his sons, Algernon and brother (whose name I do not\r\nremember) would pay all costs of making said reaper and put the same in\r\nuse to best of their ability.\"\r\n\r\nI quote from the book entitled \"Valley of the Upper Wabash, Indiana,\"\r\npublished by Henry Ellsworth in 1838:\r\n\r\n\"Another material reduction of the expense attending the cultivation of\r\nhay and other crops will be found in the use of some of the mowing and\r\nreaping machines recently invented.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Editorial Comment]\r\n\r\n\"A machine of this description, invented by Mr. Obed Hussey, of Cambridge,\r\nMaryland, has of late excited general admiration, from the neatness and\r\nrapidity of its execution, and the great amount of labor which its use\r\nwill save. Its introduction on large farms, of the description we have\r\nmentioned, will undoubtedly be followed by remarkable results. These\r\nmachines, when in good order (and they seldom need repair), can cut from\r\ntwelve to fifteen acres of grass, and from fifteen to twenty acres of\r\nwheat, daily.\r\n\r\n\"The following letter from John Stonebraker, Esq., of Hagerstown,\r\nMaryland, will exhibit his experience in the use of this machine.\r\n\r\n\"He was induced (as the writer knows from personal communication with\r\nhim on the subject) to try it from the representations of others, and\r\nwith many misgivings as to the result. That trial, however, has\r\nsatisfied him and with him, many of his neighbors, of the great utility\r\nof the machine.\r\n\r\n\"The letter is as follows:\r\n\r\n    \"'Hagerstown, August 15, 1837.\r\n\r\n    \"'Dear Sir: Will you please give this a place in your paper,\r\n    for the benefit of wheat growers. As the subject is of public\r\n    interest, it is hoped that other papers will circulate it through\r\n    the grain growing districts of the country.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A Hussey Testimonial]\r\n\r\n    \"'I procured a reaping machine this summer of Mr. Hussey, the\r\n    inventor, which I have used through my wheat harvest. It was in\r\n    constant use every day, and performed its work to my satisfaction,\r\n    and far better than I had any expectation of when I first engaged\r\n    it of Mr. Hussey. When the ground is clear of rocks, loose stones,\r\n    stumps, etc., and the grain stands well, it cuts it perfectly\r\n    clear, taking every head; and, if well managed, scatters none, but\r\n    leaves it in neat heaps ready for binding. When the grain is flat\r\n    down, the machine will of course pass over it; but if it be\r\n    leaning, or tangled only, it is cut nearly as well as if standing,\r\n    excepting when it leans from the machine, and then if the horses\r\n    are put in a trot it will be very well cut. But in cutting such\r\n    grain much depends on the expertness of the hand who pushes off\r\n    the grain, in making clean work and good sheaves. I found the\r\n    machine capable of going through anything growing on my wheat\r\n    land, such as weeds and grass, no matter how thick.\r\n\r\n    \"'After my harvest was over, I cut my seed timothy with the same\r\n    neatness and ease that I did my grain. As respects the durability\r\n    of the machine, I can say this much for my machine, that not the\r\n    least thing has given out yet; it appears as strong as a cart, and\r\n    but little liable to get out of order, if well used. I was advised\r\n    by Mr. Hussey of the necessity of keeping some of the parts well\r\n    greased; this I have punctually attended to, and no perceptible\r\n    wear yet appears, beyond the ordinary wear of any other machinery.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Durability of the Machine]\r\n\r\n    \"'It is immaterial to the machine whether the speed be a walk, or\r\n    trot; although a walk will make the most perfect work. My speed\r\n    was a common walk, but a trot is sometimes necessary to counteract\r\n    the effect of a strong wind when blowing from behind, in order to\r\n    incline the grain backwards, on to the platform, to make good\r\n    bundles. A quick walk is required to make good work in very short\r\n    and scattering grain. The machine performs well, up or down hill,\r\n    provided the surface be not too broken. By its compactness and\r\n    ease of management, rocks, and stumps too high to be cut over, can\r\n    be easily avoided. Although a rough surface is very objectionable,\r\n    yet I have cut over very rocky ground with no material difficulty.\r\n    I can say one thing which to some may appear incredible, but it is\r\n    not the less true; the cutters of my machine have not been\r\n    sharpened since I have had it; nor have I yet seen any appearance\r\n    of a need of it in the quality of its work. How many harvests a\r\n    machine would cut without sharpening is hard to say. I propose\r\n    sharpening mine once a year only. I have used two horses at a time\r\n    in the machine, and sometimes changed at noon; they worked it with\r\n    ease, the draught being light. I took no account of what I cut in\r\n    any one day, with this exception: in less than half a day I cut\r\n    six acres, and was often detained for want of the requisite number\r\n    of binders, by which much time was lost. My machine being\r\n    something narrower than those generally made by Mr. Hussey, I\r\n    could cut but about one acre in going two miles; this, at the\r\n    moderate gait of two and a half miles per hour, would amount to\r\n    twelve and a half acres in ten hours; and at four miles per hour,\r\n    a speed at which the work is done in fine style, the amount would\r\n    be twenty acres in ten hours. I should judge my quantity per day\r\n    to range between ten and fifteen acres, yet I am decided in the\r\n    opinion that I can cut twenty acres in a day, of good grain, on\r\n    good ground, by the usual diligence of harvest hands, with a\r\n    little increase of my usual speed, and a change of horses. Two\r\n    hands are required to work the machine, a man to push off the\r\n    grain and a boy to drive, besides a number of binders,\r\n    proportioned to the quantity cut. As the machine can be drawn\r\n    equally fast in heavy or light grain, the number of binders is\r\n    necessarily increased in heavy grain, except an additional speed\r\n    be given in light grain. Under every circumstance, the number of\r\n    binders will vary from four to ten; and, when the usual care is\r\n    practiced by the binders, there will be much less waste than in\r\n    any other method of cutting.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A Labor-Saving Machine]\r\n\r\n    \"'I speak with more confidence of the merits and capacity of Mr.\r\n    Hussey's reaping machine, from the circumstance of having pushed\r\n    the grain off myself for several days, in order to make myself\r\n    practically and thoroughly acquainted with it, before putting it\r\n    into the hands of my laboring men. The land in this country being\r\n    rather rocky and uneven, it is hard to say what may be the\r\n    ultimate advantage of these machines to our farmers; but from what\r\n    little experience I have had, I am resolved not to be without one\r\n    or two of them. I can therefore recommend the machine with\r\n    confidence, especially to those who have a large proportion of\r\n    smooth ground in cultivation. It is undoubtedly a labor saving\r\n    machine, and worthy of their attention.\r\n\r\n    'JOHN STONEBRAKER.\r\n\r\n    'Mr. Bell, Editor of the Torch Light.'\r\n\r\n\"To this testimonial from one of the best and most practical farmers in\r\nMaryland could be added many more, should they be needed. Farther\r\nimprovements on the part of the inventor, during the past year, have\r\nmuch increased the power of the machine; and its adoption, as a valuable\r\nagricultural implement, is becoming very general.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Other Testimonials]\r\n\r\n\"One of these machines is now in the possession of the writer, which\r\narrived too late for use during the harvest of the present season.

It was accordingly\r\nexhibited in Oxford, Talbot county, on the first of July, in presence of\r\nthe board, and a considerable number of other gentlemen. Its performance\r\nmay justly be denominated perfect, as it cuts every spear of grain,\r\ncollects it in bunches of the proper size for sheaves, and lays it\r\nstraight and even for the binders. On the 12th of July a public\r\nexhibition was made at Easton, under the direction of the board; several\r\nhundred persons, principally farmers, assembled to witness it, and\r\nexpressed themselves highly satisfied with the result. At the Trappe,\r\nwhere it was shown by the inventor on the following Saturday, an equal\r\ndegree of approbation was evinced. It was afterwards used on the farm of\r\nMr. Tench Tilghman, where 180 acres of wheat, oats, and barley were cut\r\nwith it. Three mules of medium size worked in it constantly, with as\r\nmuch ease as in a drag harrow. They moved with equal facility in a walk\r\nor a trot. A concise description of this simple implement will show that\r\nit is admirably adapted to the important purpose for which it was\r\ninvented. Resting on two wheels, which are permanently attached to the\r\nmachine, and impart the motion to the whole, the main body of the\r\nmachine is drawn by the horses along the outer edge of the standing\r\ngrain. As the horses travel outside of the grain, it is neither knocked\r\ndown or tangled in the slightest degree. Behind the wheels is a platform\r\n(supported by a roller or wheel), which projects beyond the side of the\r\nmachine five feet into the grain. On the front of the edge projecting\r\npart of the platform is the cutter. This is composed of twenty-one\r\nteeth, resembling large lancet blades, which are placed side by side,\r\nand firmly riveted to a rod of iron. A lateral motion is imparted to it\r\nby a crank, causing it to vibrate between two rows of iron spikes, which\r\npoint forward. As the machine advances, the grain is cut and falls\r\nbackwards on the platform, where it collects in a pile. A man is placed\r\non the part of the platform directly behind the horses, and with a rake\r\nof peculiar construction pushes off the grain in separate bunches, each\r\nbunch making a sheaf. It may appear to some that the grain will\r\naccumulate too rapidly for this man to perform his duty. But, upon\r\nconsidering the difference between the space occupied by the grain when\r\nstanding, and when lying in a pile after it is cut, it will be evident\r\nthat the raker has ample time to push off the bunches even in the\r\nthickest grain. In thin grain he has to wait until sufficient has\r\ncollected to form a sheaf.\r\n\r\n\"The machine is driven around the grain, which may be sown either on a\r\nsmooth surface or on corn ridges. For the first round a way may be\r\ncleared with a cradle; but this is deemed unnecessary, for the grain,\r\nwhen driven over, is left in an inclined position, and by cutting it in\r\nthe opposite direction as much of it is saved as with a cradle. Fourteen\r\nacres in corn lands were cut between 10 A. M. and 7-1/2 P. M. The hands\r\nhad never worked with the machine before, nor was it a trial day's work;\r\nfor, owing to the shortness of the straw, the machine was not allowed to\r\ncut when passing over the ridges from one side of the ground to the\r\nother, and this time was consequently lost. From the principle on which\r\nthe cutting is performed, a keen edge to the cutter is by no means\r\nessential. The toughest weeds, an occasional corn stalk, or a stick of\r\nthe thickness of a man's little finger, have been frequently cut without\r\nat all affecting its operation; it can be sharpened, however, in a few\r\nminutes with a file. The width of the swath may be increased by having\r\nthe cutter made longer, and the same machine will cut a stubble of\r\nseveral different heights.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Mr. Hussey Awarded Silver Cups]\r\n\r\n\"There is ample room to make the different parts of any size, though the\r\nstrength of every part has been fully tested. The machine has been often\r\nchoked by oyster-shells getting into the cutter, in attempting to cut\r\ntoo low a stubble. The motion of the machinery being checked, the main\r\nwheels slide on the ground; the strain on every part being equal to the\r\npower exerted by the horses. It can be managed by any intelligent,\r\ncareful negro. We deem it a simple, strong, and effective machine, and\r\ntake much pleasure in awarding unanimously the meritorious inventor of\r\nit a handsome pair of silver cups.\r\n\r\n\"ROBERT H.

Another was sent to Illinois.\r\n\r\n\"The turning and fitting for these machines was done at the mill of\r\nHenry Rogers, about 500 yards away from the little shop. In the\r\nfollowing copy of a recent affidavit sent us, date not given, these last\r\nmatters are sufficiently substantiated.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Lane continues:\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The True Inventor]\r\n\r\n\"Who invented the Reaper? The full, honest answer is that Obed Hussey\r\ninvented the Reaper.\r\n\r\n\"Between April and July, 1835, John Lane and Henry Rogers (with Isaac\r\nand Clark Lane assisting in the work) at their respective places of\r\nbusiness one mile north of Mt. Healthy, Hamilton County, Ohio, made to\r\norder of Obed Hussey one Reaping machine for S. F. and Algernon Foster,\r\nthen of the same County and State. Said Reaper was made to conform to or\r\nwith drawings and patterns made and furnished by the said Obed Hussey,\r\nwho also superintended the work of making the machine, and witnessed its\r\ntrial in the field near the middle of June, 1835, in presence of many\r\nfarmers, mechanics and others near by where the same was made; and when\r\nand where it was delivered to the Messrs. Foster's, who took this same\r\nreaper to La Porte County, Indiana, for the reaping season of the same\r\nyear.\r\n\r\n\"For the iron and steel work done as aforesaid books in my possession\r\nshow that fifty-three and 69/100 dollars was paid by Messrs. Fosters,\r\nJuly 6th, 1835, to John Lane and by him receipted for in full, etc.,\r\netc.\r\n\r\n\"The cutting device we then made for this machine evidently was the\r\ninvention of Obed Hussey; and it was as near exactly the same in all\r\nmaterial parts to the cutting device now universally in use, as the hand\r\nmade sickle could then or now be made. The sections of sickle were\r\nforged steel blades V shaped, having serrated or sickle cut edges, and\r\nriveted to vibrating bar passing through slotted fingers, substantially\r\nriveted to the apron or table upon which the cut grain fell in position\r\nto be raked, or 'forked off.'\r\n\r\n\"This Obed Hussey machine cutting in a good average stand of barley,\r\nJune, 1835, was light draught for two horses and left as clean and as\r\nevenly cut stubble behind it as the best of machines now do the same\r\nwork. But one fault, if any, with this first reaper was _the lack of\r\none or more cogs_ in the driving wheel that gave motion to the\r\nsickle, which required the team to walk a bit too fast for teams of\r\nhabitual, or slow motion.\r\n\r\n(Signed) \"CLARK LANE.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: McCormick Late in the Field]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: McCormick's Application Rejected]\r\n\r\nRegarding one who became a competitor of Hussey, much can be gathered\r\nfrom the U.S. Patent Office. McCormick, who came comparatively late in\r\nthe field, when applying for an extension of his patents made many\r\nadmissions which were afterwards shown to dispute that he had\r\naccomplished a successful machine before Mr. Hussey and others. He tells\r\nus in his petition and brief to the Commissioner of Patents that he had\r\noperated his machine in some late wheat in the harvest of 1831, but\r\nthat, although he was sometimes flattered, he was often discouraged;\r\nthat he did not make sales or sell rights because not satisfied that the\r\nreaper would succeed well. He was not sufficiently satisfied of its\r\nbeing a \"useful\" machine to patent the reaper; he tells us that its\r\nconstruction and proportions were imperfect and its cutting apparatus\r\ndefective on account of liability to choke. He admits that the cutting\r\n\"proved not sufficiently certain to be relied upon in all situations\"\r\nuntil \"the improvement in the fingers and reversed angle of the teeth of\r\nthe sickle\" shown in his patent of 1845 were adopted. A farmer ordered a\r\nmachine to be delivered in 1841, but McCormick \"did not then feel that\r\nit was safe to warrant its performance.\" These facts are found in the\r\nrecords of the United States Patent Office. Referring to Mr. Hussey, on\r\nwhose patent, among others, McCormick's application for an extension was\r\nrejected, who proved to be a factor he must consider, he said: \"I did\r\nnot interfere with him because I did not find him very much in the way,\r\ncalculated to beat him without, and supposed it might be best to do so.\"\r\nMr. Hussey, no doubt, took the charitable view and supposed Mr.\r\nMcCormick to have meant that his proofs would have been sufficient to\r\nsupport him in his own rights. Mr. Hussey, the Quaker, wrote the Board\r\nto whom McCormick's application for an extension had been referred, and\r\nfrom his letter I quote:\r\n\r\n\"In view of all these facts, I feel justified in asking your Honorable\r\nBoard a decision, which, while it adjudges McCormick's machine according\r\nto its merits, will not be prejudicial to my interests, seeing that Mr.\r\nMcCormick makes no claims to the grand principle in my machine, which\r\nmakes it valuable, and so much better than his, which principle I claim\r\nas my invention.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Mr. Hussey's Attitude]\r\n\r\n\"I had no intention, neither had I any desire, to place any obstacle in\r\nthe way of the extension of McCormick's patent, but the course he has\r\ntaken, before your Board and before Congress, has compelled me to act in\r\nself defense, by which I have given your Honorable Board much trouble,\r\nwhich I would have gladly avoided.\"\r\n\r\nMr. McCormick also said to the Board: \"If my claim be made out as so far\r\nappears from the evidence presented, it will be observed (as I think)\r\nthat nothing will be left of Mr. Hussey's claim to which he is entitled,\r\nand all the improvements he has added since his patent have, I believe,\r\nbeen taken from mine.\" Reference is no doubt had to the effect that\r\nHussey, in some of his machines, used only a single drive wheel and\r\nbalanced his machine thereon. He confessed that he never received\r\nprofits from his first patent until after twelve years of study, and\r\nnever should have realized anything from the invention but for later\r\nimprovements, and he continues as follows: \"If then it shall appear that\r\nI am the original inventor of all the leading and important principles\r\nof the invention, is it wrong that I should ask for reciprocal benefits\r\nfor myself, who alone have brought them into being? Mr. Hussey's prior\r\npatent stood in Mr. McCormick's way, but its inventor raised no voice\r\nagainst the extension of McCormick's rights unless his prior rights\r\nbecame endangered. The honors due Mr. Hussey were not lessened by the\r\nCommissioner of Patents when treating of a competitive claimant to have\r\ninvented the reaper.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Not McCormick's Inventions]\r\n\r\nMr. McCormick took out a third patent in 1847 covering inventions shown\r\nby the statement of Leander and others to have been the invention of the\r\n_father_ or _some one else_. An application was made for the\r\nextension of this patent. It then became necessary that the applicant\r\nshow that he had not reaped the benefits he believed himself entitled to\r\nthrough his monopoly for the term of the patent.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Neither Brilliant nor Extraordinary]\r\n\r\nThe value of the second patent that of 1845, may be gathered from the\r\nwords of the Commissioner of Patents: \"The invention of 1845, considered\r\nin itself, and examined in presence of the reaping machine as then in\r\nsuccessful operation, both in Europe and America, can scarcely be\r\nregarded as brilliant or in any degree extraordinary.\"\r\n\r\nThe Commissioner further said:\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: An Efficient Machine]\r\n\r\n\"It was a conviction of the inefficiency of the machine that led the\r\napplicant to make his invention of 1847, which, by a modification of\r\npre-existing elements, provided an advantageous location for the raker's\r\nseat. Upon this his fame as an inventor rests, and to this is his reaper\r\nindebted for the triumphs it has achieved. This seat had been previously\r\nknown in at least nine patented reapers; but it had not been well\r\nplaced, and an appropriate location for it was, up to 1847, an\r\nacknowledged desideratum. Whatever, however, may have been the value or\r\nthe success of the reaper as improved in 1847, such value or success can\r\nexert no influence in determining the issue under discussion.\"\r\n\r\nThe Commissioner further said, referring to the 1847 patent:\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: McCormick's \"Invention\" Valueless]\r\n\r\n\"Without the parts thus slowly accumulated and combined, and which have\r\nbeen so unhesitatingly appropriated by himself, _his own invention\r\nwould have been as valueless as would be a shingle to him who could find\r\nno house-top on which to nail it_. The construction insisted on would\r\ncompel the public to pay again, and pay extravagantly, for that which is\r\nalready its own, alike by purchase and by long uninterrupted\r\npossession.\"\r\n\r\nThe authorities cited make it clear the Hussey reaper was successful,\r\nfrom the start, but _the Patent Office did not seem to think that the\r\nmachine of his opponent for honors was so_.\r\n\r\nThe Commissioner in his decision refers to the testimony of William S.\r\nMcCormick, who, at that time, was a partner of Cyrus McCormick as a\r\nmanufacturer and seller of the McCormick reaper:\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A Worthless Machine]\r\n\r\n\"As a farmer I used the reaper without a seat, before a good one was\r\ninvented, and am perfectly certain that it was so nearly worthless that\r\na machine without one could not be sold at any price that would pay in\r\ncompetition with one having a raker's seat; this is my experience from\r\nmy intimate connection with the business for many years.\"\r\n(Commissioner's Decision, January 28, 1859.)\r\n\r\nI further find:\r\n\r\n\"In the criticism which has been necessarily made upon the invention of\r\n1845, there has been no design to detract from the acknowledged value\r\nand usefulness of the machine, as constructed under the patent of 1847.\r\nIt has had its brilliant successes in England and France, but it has\r\nalso had its marked discomfitures when competing with other machines.\r\nThough enjoying a great and perhaps a still expanding popularity, it is\r\nby no means a universal favorite.\"\r\n\r\nThe last words of the Commissioner are: \"The application must therefore\r\nbe rejected.\"\r\n\r\nThere were no questions raised as to the invention of Mr. Hussey.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: McCormick Had to Pay for Hussey Improvements]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Mr. Hussey Did Not Need the Improvements of Others]\r\n\r\nThe statement that McCormick's success was founded upon the inventions\r\nof others and to no extent upon his own, as quoted from \"Memorial of\r\nRobert McCormick,\" is in part admitted by Cyrus McCormick, who, in his\r\naffidavit when applying for the extension of his 1847 patent said: \"He\r\nhas, at the expense of much thought, time, and money, added many other\r\nimportant improvements to it since 1847, which have contributed to the\r\nprofits of his manufacture.\" He then refers to other improvements,\r\nsaying: Among such improvements by others as he has had to pay for, are\r\nthe inventions of his brothers, of Obed Hussey, of Jonathan Reed, of\r\nHenry Green, of Solymon Bell and of Joseph Nesen. It is known that for\r\nnearly thirty years Obed Hussey manufactured and sold reaping machines\r\nand mowers in his limited way and, _infringing no rights of others,\r\nhad no royalties to pay_. To such an extent was his mind that of an\r\ninventor, that he devoted thought to many side lines, the expense of\r\nwhich taxed his abilities until, when his patent of 1847 had but two\r\nyears to run, he sold it for $200,000.00.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMMISSIONER'S DECISION\r\n\r\nIn the matter of this application of Eunice B. Hussey, Administratrix of\r\nObed Hussey, deceased, for the extension of Reissued Letters Patent No.\r\n449 for an improvement in Reaping Machines, dated the 14th day of April,\r\n1857, being a division and re-issue of original Letters Patent No. 5227,\r\ndated the 7th day of August, 1847, for an improvement in Reaping\r\nmachines.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Applications of Mr. Hussey's Widow for Patent Extension all\r\nGranted]\r\n\r\nAlso, the application of the same party for the extension of the\r\nReissued Letters Patent No. 451, for an improvement in Reaping Machines,\r\ndated the 14th day of April 1851, being a division and Reissue of\r\nOriginal Letters Patent No. 5227, dated the 7th day of August, 1847, for\r\nan improvement in Reaping Machines.\r\n\r\nAlso, the application of the same party for the extension of Reissued\r\nLetters Patent No. 742, for an improvement in Reaping Machines, dated\r\nthe 21st day of June, 1859, being a division of Reissued Letters Patent\r\nNo. 450, dated the 14th of April, 1857, being a division and Reissue of\r\noriginal Letters Patent No. 5227, dated the 7th day of August, 1847, for\r\nan improvement in Reaping Machines.\r\n\r\nAlso the application of the same party for the extension of Reissued\r\nLetters Patent No. 917, dated the 28th day of February, 1860, for an\r\nimprovement in Reaping Machines, being a reissue of reissued Letters\r\nPatent No. 743, dated June 21, 1859, the last named Patent being a\r\ndivision and reissue of reissued Letters Patent No. 450, dated the 14th\r\nday of April, 1857, which last mentioned patent was a division and\r\nreissue of original Letters Patent No. 5227, dated the 7th of August,\r\n1847, for an Improvement in Reaping Machines.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Claim of Opponents Overruled]\r\n\r\nThese four applications for the extension of the said four patents, Nos.\r\n449, 451, 742 and 917, having been made in due form on the 30th day of\r\nNovember, 1860, and the Commissioner of Patents having caused to be\r\npublished in due and legal form, notice of said applications and of the\r\ntime and place when and where the same would be considered. And the\r\napplicant, the administratrix and widow of the patentee, having duly\r\nfurnished and filed statements in writing under oath of the ascertained\r\nvalue of the said inventions and improvements claimed in said patents,\r\nand of the receipts and expenditures of the patentee and his legal\r\nrepresentatives sufficiently in detail to exhibit a true and faithful\r\naccount of loss and profit in any manner accruing to the patentee and\r\nhis legal representatives from and by reason of said inventions and\r\npatents. And the testimony in these four cases having been duly filed\r\nand considered and referred to the principal Examiner having charge of\r\nthe class of inventions to which these belong, and the said Examiner\r\nhaving made a full report upon the said cases, and particularly that the\r\ninventions or improvements, secured by the said four patents, were new\r\nand patentable when patented. And the printed arguments in these cases\r\nhaving been duly filed and considered, and the day of hearing viz. the\r\n28th day of Feb., 1861, arrived, undersigned, the Acting Commissioner of\r\nPatents, sitting at the time and place designated in the said published\r\nnotice to hear and decide upon the evidence produced before him both for\r\nand against the extension, and having heard all persons who appeared to\r\nshow cause why the extension should not be granted, does decide as\r\nfollows, _viz._:\r\n\r\nThat the applications for extension in these cases were made at a proper\r\ntime, and not prematurely as the opponents have contended. The only\r\nground alleged to support the allegation that the applications were\r\npremature is that the receipts for the year 1861 cannot be fully\r\nascertained at this time, but must be estimated or guessed at. If this\r\nis a good reason for not considering the applications now it would also\r\nbe good on the 7th of August when the patent expires, for the receipts\r\nwould not then be ascertained, but would still be the subject of\r\nestimate only. These receipts can be as well determined by this mode\r\nnow, as in August. The objection on this point is not therefore well\r\ntaken, and must be overruled. An application for extension cannot be\r\nregarded as premature if made during the last year of the term of the\r\npatent, and the total receipts are known or can be estimated with\r\nreasonable certainty. In addition to this there seems to be no little\r\nforce in the argument of Counsel that the public convenience would be\r\npromoted by an early decision upon these cases before manufacturers\r\nenter upon their preparations for another year's business.\r\n\r\nBesides these considerations, which of themselves are sufficient to\r\ndetermine the propriety of hearing these cases at the present time, the\r\nlate Commissioner of Patents fixed this time for these hearings with\r\nreference to the public interests therein, and is an additional reason\r\nwhy it should be adhered to, yet I should have no hesitation in\r\npostponing the hearing if it were made to appear that the public\r\ninterest were likely in any way to be subserved by such postponement.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Value and Importance of Hussey Inventions Fully Established]\r\n\r\nThe report of the Examiner leaves no doubt in my mind as to the novelty\r\nof each of the inventions which constitute the subject matter of the\r\nfour patents for which the extensions are asked. His report is equally\r\nconclusive as to the _utility_ of the inventions, their _value\r\nand importance_ to the public, and as to the patentee's diligence in\r\nintroducing them into public use, and his efforts to derive remuneration\r\nfrom their sale.\r\n\r\nFrom a careful examination of all these points myself, I have arrived at\r\nthe same conclusion as the Examiner.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Opponents Contentions Not Proven by Facts]\r\n\r\nThe Counsel, Wm. N. Whitely, the opponent of these extensions have urged\r\nwith great pertinacity that the inventions are not novel. They allege\r\nthat the same thing existed before in Hiram Moore's \"Big Harvester\" in\r\nMichigan--the Ambler Machine in New York--the Nicholson Machine in\r\nMaryland--and the White and Hoyle Machines in Ohio. They also contend\r\nthat the invention claimed in Patent No. 451 especially, is of no\r\nutility or value. On a careful review of all these points with the light\r\nof the Argument of Counsel, I am quite clear that the Examiners\r\nconclusion as to the novelty and utility of Hussey's invention are\r\nsound. The Moore or \"Big Harvester\" cutting apparatus, the testimony\r\nshows was designated for the performance of a different duty from\r\nHussey's and could not without essential changes of construction,\r\namounting to changes in its principle and mode of operation, be used for\r\nthe same purposes as that of Hussey.\r\n\r\nThe Ambler machine had a straight edge cutter vibrating on arms through\r\nbarbed or open slotted fingers. His Cutting apparatus lacked an\r\nessential element found in Hussey's the scalloped cutter, to say nothing\r\nof other material differences. This machine has nothing to impeach the\r\nnovelty of Hussey's inventions. The Nicholson Model has no vibrating\r\nscalloped cutter which is one of the specific elements of Hussey's\r\ncombination. The White machine as shown in the exhibit produced and\r\nwhich the testimony shows has been recently fabricated is not\r\nsubstantially the same combination claimed in patent No. 742. It has not\r\nlike Hussey's a cutter with flush edges on both sides of the angle of\r\nthe forks on the _same side_ of the blade. The Hoyle Machine,\r\naccording to Hoyle's own deposition, is subsequent in date to Hussey's\r\ninvention.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Utility of Hussey's Inventions]\r\n\r\nIt is contended by the opponents that the patent No. 451 has no utility\r\nor value. I am inclined to the opinion that the utility of the\r\nimprovement specified in this patent is, of itself, small, compared with\r\nthe improvements covered by the other patents of Hussey now before me,\r\nwhich are all of very great utility, and two of them indispensable in\r\nthe present state of the art. Still since the novelty of the improvement\r\nclaimed in No. 451, is admitted and is proven by the testimony of Henry\r\nB. Renwick to have some utility as one of this series of patents, I\r\nthink it has sufficient utility to justify an extension.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Mr. Hussey Did Not Abandon His Invention]\r\n\r\nThe contestant's counsel have argued from the testimony of Lovegrove,\r\nthat Hussey abandoned his inventions to the public by having them on\r\nsale more than two years before applying for a patent. The testimony\r\ndoes not sustain this point. Besides, an inventor does not abandon his\r\ninvention to the public by constructing a machine embracing it, in the\r\nsame factory where he makes and sells other machines. Nor by using it\r\nexperimentally in such a factory or elsewheres. Nor by keeping it in\r\nsuch a factory from the autumn of one year to the harvest of the next\r\nyear. Nor by doing all or any of these things more than two years before\r\nhis application for a patent.\r\n\r\nThe statement of receipts and expenditures is unusually full and in\r\ndetail, more so than is necessary to fulfill the requirements of the\r\nlaw.\r\n\r\nThere are two classes of expenditures and two corresponding classes of\r\nreceipts, _viz._:\r\n\r\n1st. Expenditures and receipts on account of the manufacture and sale of\r\nReapers and Mowing Machines embracing the patentee's improvements.\r\n\r\n2nd. Expenditures and receipts on account of the sales of Patent rights\r\nand licenses, and compromise of infringements.\r\n\r\n    The Patentee manufactured and sold about 2,000 machines, and a few\r\n    other articles at a cost of materials and labor         $195,292.88\r\n    Shop and Tools                                            12,500.00\r\n    One-quarter of patentee's time and expenses                9,008.22\r\n                                                            ___________\r\n                                                            $216,801.10\r\n\r\nThe receipts on account of the sale of these manufactures were:\r\n\r\n    Cash for Reapers                                        $216,607.90\r\n    Cash for parts of Reapers                                 22,416.58\r\n    Notes and Book Accounts                                   11,388.23\r\n    Cash for Corn Crushers                                     1,135.25\r\n    Discount and Interest                                      2,327.84\r\n                                                            ___________\r\n                                                            $253,875.80\r\n\r\nThe result of the manufacturing business is an excess of receipts over\r\nexpenditures of $37,074.70. This statement, however, allows nothing for\r\nmanufacturer's profits. An allowance for such profit ought to be made but\r\nin this case the object is to eliminate from the gross receipts such\r\nprofits as have in any manner accrued from or by reason of the inventions\r\nclaimed in the patents. Now receipts or profits that result from business\r\ntalents or skill in manufacturing or in financeering are not receipts or\r\nprofits in any manner accruing from or by reason of an invention. In the\r\ncase of Seymour and Morgan vs. McCormick-Howards Reports Vol. 16 p. 480,\r\nthe Supreme Court of the United States held that the ruling of Judge\r\nNelson that the whole profits of the manufacture of Reaping machines\r\nin which one small part of the machines infringed a patent was to be\r\nconsidered as accruing from the use of the patented part was erroneous,\r\nand that a reasonable manufacturer's profit for the use of the Capital\r\nso, in addition to the actual cost of the machine must first be deducted\r\nfrom the gross receipts, and if then there was any excess, that might be\r\nassigned to patents. This decision I should deem binding and conclusive\r\nupon the subject even if I did not think that the values of business\r\ncapital and talent are as fairly charges against the receipts of business\r\nas the values of a business house or tools.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: An Inadequate Profit]\r\n\r\nIn this case there is only an excess of $37,074.70 of the receipts over\r\nthe expenditure or something less than 14 per cent upon the gross amount\r\nof sales. This is a very inadequate profit for manufacturing and selling,\r\nbut it is all there is, and it is all that I can allow.\r\n\r\nIf the excess of the receipts over the expenditures had amounted to three\r\ntimes fourteen per cent, I should have had no hesitation in allowing the\r\nwhole of it for manufacturer's profit, and should not have deemed it more\r\nthan a reasonable allowance in view of the testimony of Long, which shows\r\nthat his firm have made a profit of over fifty per cent after paying\r\npatent fees, on their manufacture of reapers.\r\n\r\nIt seems to be supposed from the reference which has been made to\r\nCommissioner Holt's decision in the case of McCormick's application for\r\nthe extension of his patent of 1845, that he entertained views at\r\nvariance with those I have expressed as to the justice of allowing\r\nmanufacturer's profits as a part of the expenditure, and as an offset\r\nagainst the receipts, but a careful examination of that opinion will show\r\nclearly that Mr. Holt was not willing to allow a charge for the use of\r\nCapital, and for wear and tear of machines (which are the Constituent\r\nelements of a manufacturer's claim to allow for profit) and then, again\r\nallow a second or duplicate charge for the same things under the name of\r\nmanufacturer's profits. This is the extent to which Mr. Holt goes, and I\r\nfully agree with him.\r\n\r\nThe expenditures on account of the patents and the sale of rights and\r\nlicenses under the same are:\r\n\r\n    For three quarter of patentee's\r\n      labor and expense                                     $27,024.68\r\n\r\n    For sundry legal and traveling expenses                  44,562.88\r\n                                                            __________\r\n                                                            $71,587.56\r\n\r\nThe receipts on the same account are:\r\n\r\n    Cash for licenses, sale of rights, etc.                 $92,788.38\r\n\r\n    Notes and unsettled accounts                             23,748.89\r\n    License fees estimated for 1861                          10,000.00\r\n                                                           ___________\r\n                                                           $126,537.27\r\n\r\nshowing that the receipts exceed the expenditures by $54,949.71 or\r\n$13,737.42 for each of the four patents.\r\n\r\nThis I can have no hesitation in pronouncing to be a totally inadequate\r\ncompensation for inventions of such great value and importance.\r\n\r\nAfter a most laborious examination and careful consideration of the\r\nwhole matter, it appears to my full and entire satisfaction, having due\r\nregard to the public interest therein, that it is just and proper that\r\nthe term of the said reissued patents No. 449, No. 451, No. 742, and No.\r\n917 should severally be extended by reason of the patentee, without\r\nfault or neglect on his part, having failed to obtain from the use and\r\nsale of his said inventions a reasonable remuneration for the time,\r\ningenuity and expense bestowed upon the same and the introduction\r\nthereof into use.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Hussey's Inventions the Basis of all Reaper Manufacturers\r\nProfits]\r\n\r\nThe list of licenses under these patents show the acquiescence of the\r\nprincipal manufacturers in the justice of Hussey's claims. The list\r\nshows that the manufacturers of Reapers have made large profits, and\r\nthat Hussey's improvements are the foundation of their success. It is\r\ncertainly just and equitable that Hussey's heirs should be allowed to\r\nparticipate in the advantages of using his own inventions to an extent\r\nmore nearly commensurate with the merits of those inventions.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A Merited Tribute from the U.S. Patent Office]\r\n\r\nThe character of the opposition to these applications, in which but a\r\nsingle manufacturer has entered an appearance is such, as greatly\r\nstrengthens this view, and I feel constrained to regard this tacit\r\nassent, of the great body of manufacturers to these applications for\r\nextension, an additional evidence of the soundness of my own conclusions.\r\nAs it is also a fitting and merited tribute to Obed Hussey, now in his\r\ngrave, for the invaluable contributions his genius and industry have made\r\nto the improvements of the age.\r\n\r\nThe said four patents, Nos. 449, 451, 742 and 917, are accordingly\r\nextended for the term of seven years from the 7th day of August, 1861.\r\n\r\nS. T. SHUGERT,\r\nActing Commissioner of Patents.\r\nUnited States Patent Office,\r\nMar. 1, 1861.\r\n\r\n\r\nA BRIEF NARRATIVE OF THE INVENTION OF REAPING MACHINES\r\n\r\nAnd an Examination of the Claims for Priority of Invention\r\n\r\nThe object aimed at in this examination is to ascertain as far as\r\nreliable evidence within reach will establish the fact--and before the\r\nevidence may be lost--to whom belongs the credit of first rendering the\r\nReaping and Mowing Machine a practical and available implement to the\r\nAmerican farmer; not who _theoretically invented_ a machine for the\r\npurpose, that may have worked an hour only, and very imperfectly for\r\nthat short period, and was then laid aside; but who rendered it an\r\noperating and efficient machine that was proved by successive years in\r\nthe harvest field, capable of doing its work, and doing it well; better\r\nthan either the scythe or cradle.\r\n\r\nThe object is _not_ to detract from the merits fairly claimed by\r\nany inventor; but it is to examine into some of the rival claims,\r\nfurnish the evidence that has satisfied our own minds, and leave it for\r\nothers to judge for themselves. We would not intentionally deprive an\r\ninventor of his often dearly bought and hard-earned fame--the creation\r\nof his own genius--for it is more prized than even fine gold by many.\r\nBut it is equally just that merit should be acknowledged, and the meed\r\nof praise awarded, where it is honestly and fairly due; and to this end\r\nwe propose and intend to examine into the evidence closely and\r\ncritically. It may also be right to remark that we have no private or\r\npecuniary interest whatever, in these, or any other patent claims.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Attempts of the Ancients]\r\n\r\nAs to the theoretical portion of the business, the enquiry might be\r\ngreatly extended; indeed for past centuries, as we have imperfect\r\naccounts of Reaping Machines being used by the Romans. If the ancients\r\nwere successful in making a practical implement for Reaping, by horse,\r\nor ox power, as some ancient writers assert, we certainly have no\r\ncorrect and reliable account of a machine that would be considered\r\nefficient or useful at the present day; a machine to save or tear off\r\nthe heads only--as described by Pliny and Palladius--would more properly\r\nbe termed a gathering machine, and not at all suited to the wants and\r\nhabits of modern farmers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Silver medal won by Mr. Hussey with the Reaper at New\r\nYork in 1852.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: English Endeavors]\r\n\r\nIt was not until near the close of the past, and within the present\r\ncentury, so far as we can learn, that the subject again claimed much\r\nattention of the inventive talent of either this, or foreign countries.\r\nOf some half a dozen or more attempts made in Great Britain, and\r\nrecorded in Loudon's Encyclopedia of Agriculture, the Edinburg\r\nEncyclopedia, and other similar works, all, or nearly all, relied either\r\nupon scythes or cutters, with a rotary motion, or vibrating shears. And\r\nalthough there was \"go ahead\" about them in one sense of the term, as it\r\nwas intended for the \"cart to go before the horse,\" none of them\r\nappeared to have gained, or certainly not long retained, the confidence\r\nof the farmers; for at the exhibition of the \"World's Fair in London,\"\r\nthe whole Kingdom could not raise a Reaping Machine;--a practical\r\nimplement which was considered worth using and exhibiting.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: English Failure]\r\n\r\nThat the idea was obsolete there, and had been unsuccessful, is clearly\r\nproved by the fact that the English journals and writers of that period,\r\nwithout a single exception, spoke of the American Reapers--after the\r\ntrials!--as \"completely successful\"--\"taking every one by surprise\"--\"their\r\nreaping machines have astonished our agriculturists\"--\"few subjects have\r\ncreated a greater sensation in the agricultural world than the recent\r\nintroduction into the country of the reaping machines\"--the \"curiosity of\r\nthe crowd was irrepressible to witness such a novelty, even to stopping\r\nthe machine, and trampling the grain under foot,\" etc., etc.--Much more\r\nand similar evidence is at hand; but _better_ need not be produced to\r\nprove the entire failure of reaping machines in Great Britain, as late as\r\n1851. We would also refer the curious to Rees' Cyclopedia, for a very\r\nbrief account of what had been effected;--a few paragraphs only are\r\nwritten on reaping machines, but several pages are compiled as to the use\r\nof the scythe, sickle or reap hook, and reaping _fork_. The Doctor refers\r\nto Plunknett's Machine by name, as being \"somewhat on a new principle,\r\nthe horse drawing the machine instead of pushing it forward as was the\r\nold mode of applying the power.\" The machine is fully represented in the\r\nFarmers' Dictionary; and he winds up the account as follows: \"But the\r\nsuccess with which they have been attended has hitherto been far from\r\ncomplete;\" again, \"Other machines of this kind have still more lately\r\nbeen invented by other persons [meaning of course his own countrymen] but\r\nwithout answering the purpose in that full and complete manner which is\r\nnecessary in this sort of work.\"\r\n\r\nThe Doctor undertakes to tell us _what is wanted_, but fails entirely to\r\ninform his readers _how to do it_. That John Bull had not done it is\r\nclearly established; but Brother Jonathan, the \"Live Yankee,\" as John\r\ncalls his cousin, has solved the problem; and the solution is so simple,\r\nwhen you know how to do it! that it is marvelously strange no one for\r\ncenturies had before struck upon the right key.\r\n\r\nPhilip Pusey, Esq., M. P. and F. R. S.--the chief manager of the London\r\nExhibition--admits the failure, though apparently reluctantly; but the\r\nsource of his information, in writing about the American machines, was\r\ninterested and defective; and when he again writes on this subject he\r\nwill be better informed. He says: \"At the opening of this century it was\r\nthought that a successful reaping machine had been invented, and a\r\nreward had been voted by Parliament to its author. The machine was\r\nemployed here and abroad, but from its intricacy, fell into disuse.\r\nAnother has been lately devised in one of our Colonies, which cuts off\r\nthe heads of the corn, but leaves the straw standing, a fatal defect in\r\nan old settled country, where the growth of corn is forced by the\r\napplication of dung. Our farmers may well, therefore, have been\r\nastonished by an American implement which not only reaped the wheat, but\r\nperformed the work with the neatness and certainty of an old and perfect\r\nmachine. Its novelty of action reminded one of seeing the first engine\r\nrun on the Liverpool and Manchester railway in 1830. Its perfection\r\ndepended on its being new only in England; but in America the result of\r\nrepeated disappointments and untired perseverance, etc.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: English Claims]\r\n\r\nWe propose to prove, and by better evidence, and disinterested too, than\r\nhe then had, that in 1833, near the date of \"the first engine run on the\r\nLiverpool and Manchester railway in 1830,\" the American machine cut the\r\n\"corn\" just as perfectly, with equal \"neatness and certainty\" as did the\r\n\"Novelty\" or \"Rocket\" pass over the Liverpool and Manchester railway. We\r\nshall again recur to English authority. John Bull is a right honest and\r\nclever old gentleman in the main; but he is rather prone to claim what\r\nhe has no title for--inventions, as well as territory. We are willing to\r\ngive him what he can show a clear deed for, but no more. He beat us by\r\none year only in the Locomotive; but we fairly beat him eighteen or\r\ntwenty in the Reaping Machine; and yet some of his writers contend to\r\nthis day that we \"_pirated_\" from Bell and other English inventors\r\nall we know!\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: English Inventors and Their Mistakes]\r\n\r\nThe excitement and sensation thus produced by the American Reapers,\r\ncaused renewed efforts on the part of English inventors; some who had\r\nnear a quarter of a century previously, been endeavoring to effect this\r\n\"great desideratum,\" to use an English editorial; and the most\r\nconspicuous of these was one invented by the Rev. Patrick Bell, of\r\nScotland. Of the half a score or more and previous inventors in Great\r\nBritain--Boyce, Plunknett, Gladstone of Castle Douglass, Salmon of\r\nWaburn, Smith of Deanston in Perthshire, etc., etc.--none were waked up\r\nfrom their Rip Van Winkle slumbers; or if they were, the world is not\r\nadvised of it. They all used revolving scythes, revolving cutters, or\r\nshears instead. Several trials were made with Bell's in 1828 or 1829;\r\nand a very full and minute description with plates, was published some\r\n24 or 25 years ago, and may be found in Loudon's Encyclopedia of\r\nAgriculture.\r\n\r\nIt was, however, too complicated, too cumbersome and expensive,\r\nperformed too little service, and required too much tinkering and\r\nrepairs to be viewed as a practical and available implement.--The\r\nEnglish farmer found the sickle or reap hook preferable, for it was\r\neverywhere resorted to.--The cutting apparatus of Bell's consisted of\r\nshears, one half stationary, the other vibrating, and turning on the\r\nbolt that confined them to the iron bar which extends across the front\r\nof the frame. The vibrating motion was given by connecting the back end\r\nof one shear to a bar--making the bolt the fulcrum--and which was\r\nattached to a crank, revolving by gear to the driving wheels.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Bell's Machine]\r\n\r\nA reel was used to gather the grain to the shears, and adjustable, back\r\nand forth, and higher or lower, to suit the height of the grain. A\r\nrevolving apron delivered the grain in a continuous swath; and the team\r\nwas attached to the rear of the machine, _pushing_ it through the\r\ngrain.\r\n\r\nWe have been more minute in the description of Bell's machine, because\r\nit may have been the foundation of some of the early, and nearly\r\nsimultaneous attempts made in this country. In fact it does not admit of\r\ndoubt that several were nearly identical with Bell's in the use of the\r\nshears and reel, though with much more simple gearing, and in the\r\ngeneral arrangement. Whether they were original inventions, cannot be\r\nascertained. In this country, from 1800 to 1833 out of some 15 or 20\r\npatents granted for \"cutting grain\" and \"cutting grass,\" only four\r\nappear to have been \"restored\"; i.e. technically speaking, \"not\r\nrestored\" in models and drawings after the burning of the Patent Office\r\nin 1836. Many, if not most of them, were probably improvements in the\r\ngrain cradle, and mowing scythe; though the names are preserved, there\r\nis no record to show for what particulars the patents were granted.\r\nThere can be no doubt, however, that the inventors considered them\r\nvalueless, as they were \"not restored,\" though Congress voted large sums\r\nto replace the burnt models and drawings, without any expense to the\r\nparties. Of those restored James Ten Eyck's patent is dated 1825, Wm.\r\nManning's in 1831, Wm. & Thos. Schnebly's in 1833, and Obed Hussey's\r\nalso in 1833.\r\n\r\nJames Ten Eyck used an open reel; not only to gather the grain, but his\r\ncutters or shears, were attached to, and revolved with the reel;--very\r\nmuch, if not exactly on the principle of shearing cloth.\r\n\r\nWilliam Manning used another form of cutters, and quite different from\r\nJames Ten Eyck's--he likewise used fingers or teeth to support the grain\r\nduring the action of the horizontal cutters.\r\n\r\nWilliam and Thomas Schnebly of Maryland also used the reel, with shears\r\nas cutters, very similar to Bell's.\r\n\r\nAbraham Randall, or Rundell, of New York (for the name is spelled both\r\nways), was another of the early inventors. His patent of 1835 is not\r\nrestored, though it is stated his machine was experimented with as early\r\nas 1833 or 1834. He also used the reel, and his cutters, it is said,\r\nwere similar to Bell's--using shears.\r\n\r\nT. D. Burrall, of New York, was also one of the early inventors, about\r\n1832 or 1833, but we believe professedly after Bell's, so far as to use\r\na reel and shears.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: None Successful]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Hussey's Machine an American Triumph]\r\n\r\nNone of these machines, however, Hussey's excepted, were successful, or\r\nwere used any length of time; nor is it necessary here to refer\r\nparticularly to other attempts, about this time, or indeed prior to this\r\nperiod, for they were equally unsuccessful; and their inventors cannot\r\nclaim the merit of doing a thing, that was not in fact performed--making\r\nan efficient and successful Reaper. We may here remark, however, that so\r\nfar as now known, no machine like Bell's, on the shear or scissor\r\nprinciple, has succeeded in this country; or as we believe, is ever\r\nlikely to succeed. We have seen a number by different inventors, and all\r\nhave failed to give satisfaction. They may work well for a very brief\r\nperiod and with keen edges; but as they become dull, the shears are\r\nforced apart by the straw and grass--particularly the latter, and the\r\nmachine fails, as it inevitably must do, in its allotted duty, and for\r\nvery obvious reasons. If the shear rivet or bolt is kept tight there is\r\ntoo much friction; if loose enough to play freely it is too loose to cut\r\nwell; and, lastly, it is too liable to wear at the most important point\r\nof the whole machine. During the harvest of 1853 in England every effort\r\nwas made to uphold Bell's machine; in some cases prizes were awarded to\r\nit, though evidently partial; for in the face of these awards some who\r\nwitnessed the trials, and had used Bell's machines, laid them aside and\r\npurchased Hussey's. At the close of the season, as we learn from\r\nreliable authority, even the engineers who operated Bell's, frankly\r\nadmitted that the American machine as exhibited by Hussey, was the\r\nbetter implement, owing to the arrangement of the guards and knives;\r\nBell's required so much tinkering, that several machines were required\r\nto cope with one of Hussey's. At the recent harvest (1854) the Mark Lane\r\nExpress acknowledges that the Royal Agricultural Societies' show at\r\nLincoln, Bell's machine was \"at last fairly beaten\" by Hussey's,\r\nincluding McCormick's, and Hussey's machine received the prize over all\r\nothers. It is just, however, to add, that far as we consider Bell's\r\nmachine behind some of the present day, yet complex and cumbersome as it\r\nwas, it combined more of the essential features of success than any\r\nReaper that preceded it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Bronze medal won by Mr. Hussey with the Reaper at New\r\nYork in 1853.]\r\n\r\nWe now come to 1833, the date of Hussey's patent; and to 1834, the date\r\nof C. H. McCormick's first patent. These were known and admitted by all\r\nto have been the rivals for popular favor and patronage, from about the\r\nyear 1844 or 1845 to the opening of the great Industrial Exhibition in\r\nLondon, in 1851. To these, therefore, the enquiry will be more\r\nparticularly directed.\r\n\r\nWe must, however, refer back for a brief period to 1831; for although C.\r\nH. McCormick's first patent was dated in 1834, yet when he applied for\r\nhis extension in 1848 he alleged that _his invention_ was prior to\r\nHussey's, as he had invented a machine in 1831, two years before the\r\ndate of O. Hussey's, and three years before the date of his own patent.\r\nThe evidence produced _written and prepared_ by C. H. McCormick (and\r\nnow on file in the Patent Office) was deemed inadmissible and informal\r\nby the Board, and it refused to go on with the examination either as to\r\npriority or validity of invention without notice to Hussey--his patent\r\nbeing called in question by McCormick--to be present when the\r\ndepositions were taken.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: McCormick's Attempt to Get Hussey's Signature]\r\n\r\nBefore, however, receiving the official notice, he was called on by C. H.\r\nMcCormick in Baltimore, and requested to sign a paper, agreeing or\r\nadmitting, that the testimony he had himself prepared should be\r\nconsidered evidence--i.e. considered formal; alleging that it would save\r\nhim trouble and expense in going to Virginia. This was declined by Hussey\r\non the ground that he might thus unwittingly injure himself; he having\r\npreviously applied for an extension of his own Patent. Neither was he\r\nthen aware of the nature of this evidence; or until this interview, was\r\nhe advised of C. H. McCormick's application for extension.\r\n\r\nHussey was subsequently duly notified by order of the Board to be present\r\nat taking the depositions in Augusta County, Virginia,--the Board having\r\nadjourned three weeks for that purpose.\r\n\r\nEither just previous or subsequent to these proceedings the case was\r\nreferred by the Commissioner of Patents, or Board of Extensions, to Dr.\r\nPage, one of the Examiners of the office.\r\n\r\nHis report is as follows:\r\n\r\n    \"Patent Office,\r\n\r\n    \"Jan. 22d, 1848.\r\n\r\n    \"Sir:\r\n\r\n    \"In compliance with your requisition I have examined the patent of\r\n    Cyrus H. McCormick, dated 31st June, 1834, and found that the\r\n    principal features embraced in said patent, viz, the cutting-knife\r\n    and mode of operating it, the fingers to guide the grain and the\r\n    revolving rack for gathering the grain, were not new at the time\r\n    of granting said letters patent.\r\n\r\n    \"The knife-fingers and general arrangements and operation of the\r\n    cutting apparatus are found in the reaping machine of O. Hussey,\r\n    patented 31st Dec., 1833.\r\n\r\n    \"The revolving rack presents novelty chiefly in form, as its\r\n    operation is similar to the revolving frame of James Ten Eyck,\r\n    patented 2nd November, 1825.\r\n\r\n    \"Respectfully submitted,\r\n\r\n    \"CHAS. G. PAGE,\r\n    \"Examiner.\r\n\r\n    \"Hon. Edmund Burke, Com'r of Patents.\"\r\n\r\nAs some have enquired, and others may enquire, why a patent should issue\r\nunder these circumstances, we reply, that previous to 1836 but little, if\r\nany, examination was made as to priority of inventions, or into preceding\r\nPatents; the applicant made oath as to his invention, and the patent was\r\nissued as a matter of course. And as another matter of course, if the\r\nrival interests clashed, litigation was the result:--the Courts and\r\njuries often decided what they little understood, and at times not at\r\nall, after the pleading of well fee'd lawyers; a pretty fair illustration\r\nof the fable of the boys and frogs; it may be _fun_ for the lawyers but\r\nit is _death_ to the hopes of many a poor patentee. We are, however,\r\npleased to perceive a disposition manifested by the courts to sustain\r\npatents; even if occasionally an unjust claim is recognized as a valid\r\none, it is better, according to the legal and moral maxim, that half a\r\ndozen rogues should escape punishment for a time, than that one innocent\r\nperson should be unjustly convicted; the rogue is almost certain to be\r\ncaught in the end, and truth will ultimately triumph.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: McCormick-Hussey Controversy]\r\n\r\nThis testimony was taken in due form at Steele's Tavern, Augusta County,\r\nVa., McCormick and Hussey both being present. It is too voluminous to\r\ncopy entire, but we will refer briefly to each, having read them\r\ncarefully, and obtained certified copies of all from the Patent office.\r\n\r\nDr. N. M. Hitt testified to a reaping machine being made by C. H.\r\nMcCormick in 1831--it had a straight sickle blade.\r\n\r\nWilliam S. McCormick and Leander J. McCormick, brothers of C. H.\r\nMcCormick, also testified to the making of a machine in 1831.\r\n\r\nMary McCormick, mother of C. H. McCormick, agreed in general with the\r\ntestimony of her sons,--did not doubt but it was correct, \"it appears\r\nfamiliar to me,\" but testified to nothing in particular.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Testimony]\r\n\r\nJohn Steele, Jr., was tavernkeeper at \"Steele's Tavern,\" testified as to\r\nthe year being 1831 or 1832. In his amended testimony, admitted that C.\r\nH. McCormick wrote the paper describing the machine for him to testify\r\nto; recollects little else about the machine than the straight sickle\r\nedge.\r\n\r\nEliza H. Steele refused to testify without first seeing a certificate\r\npreviously signed by her; admitted that C. H. McCormick wrote it for her\r\nto sign; her testimony as to the year depended on the building of a\r\ncertain house, on which the workmen put 1831.\r\n\r\nJohn McCown--was a blacksmith--testified that _he_ made the \"straight\r\nsickle blade,\" and that it was \"a long, straight sickle\" blade.\r\n\r\nThis was most singular testimony to found a claim of priority of\r\ninvention on, and by which to invalidate another man's patent. There was\r\ndiscrepancy in the evidence as to the year of the invention; also whether\r\nthe machine was intended for one or two horses; how the \"fingers\" were\r\narranged, and whether of _wood_ or _iron_, _above_ or _below_, the\r\n\"straight sickle blade.\" Two of the brothers--one at least who helped to\r\nmake, if not also to invent this machine--testified that the plan or\r\narrangement of the machine here sworn to, was changed in 1840, 1841,\r\n1842, or 1843, they did not know which; from 9 to 12 years afterwards!\r\n\r\nJohn McCown swears positively that he helped to build the machine, so far\r\nat least as to forge \"a long, straight sickle;\" but neither he, or a\r\nsingle one of the seven sworn witnesses, \"_ladies_ and _gentlemen_,\"\r\ntestify that the machine ever worked a single hour, or cut as much grain\r\nof any kind as would make a single sheaf![1]\r\n\r\n      [1] The reading of this testimony strongly reminds us of an\r\n      anecdote related at the hustings in Virginia by that talented but\r\n      eccentric character, John Randolph, of Roanoake, in a political\r\n      canvass with an opponent, who promised what he would do for his\r\n      constituents, if elected. Randolph told him he was like one of his\r\n      overseers, a plausible fellow, but on whom little reliance was to\r\n      be placed--and who, desiring to show what fine crops he had\r\n      raised, exhibited a better tally board than the crop could\r\n      justify. \"I told him,\" said Randolph, \"this is very good tally,\r\n      John, but where's the corn? and I tell the gentleman, I don't want\r\n      to see his tally, but the corn--the evidence of what he ever did\r\n      to entitle him to a seat in Congress.\" The effect was electric,\r\n      and the hustings rang with plaudits. Now we would say to C. H.\r\n      McCormick, this is very good tally, John, but where's the Corn?\r\n      The evidence that the machine ever cut a single acre of grain.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: \"John Smith\"]\r\n\r\nIn a long communication to Commissioner Burke in 1848, together with a\r\nlist of sales and profits, C. H. McCormick states, and on oath, that he\r\nhad exhibited his machine in 1840 or 1841 to a considerable number of\r\nfarmers and _very satisfactorily_, though but one person could be\r\ninduced to purchase--a Mr. John Smith we believe--and that up to 1842,\r\n_eleven_ years after the alleged invention, he had sold but two\r\nmachines, and one of them conditionally. Again, in the _same paper_\r\nhe states, \"but they failed to operate well,\" and had to be altered--in\r\nother words they would not work at all. Amongst others, he had applied\r\nto \"the farmer of Virginia, Mr. Sampson,\" for a certificate as to the\r\nsatisfactory working of the machine, but it was declined.\r\n\r\nWe are not surprised at this; for some 35 years ago we were personally\r\nacquainted with this \"farmer of Virginia,\" and also with his mode of\r\nfarming; and know that a machine of any kind to please him _must\r\nwork_ and must also work \"_well_.\" Richard Sampson was at that\r\nearly day in this \"age of progress,\" one of the best and most practical\r\nfarmers in the \"Old Dominion,\" and was not a man to be \"caught napping,\"\r\neither at home or abroad.\r\n\r\nThe record shows that \"on March 29, 1848, the Board met agreeably to\r\nadjournment--Present, James Buchanan, Secretary of State, Edmund Burke,\r\nCommissioner of Patents, and R. H. Gillett, Solicitor of the\r\nTreasury--and having examined the evidence adduced in the case decide\r\nthat said patent ought not to be extended.\"\r\n\r\n(Signed) \"JAMES BUCHANAN,\r\n\"Secretary of State.\r\n\r\n\"EDMUND BURKE,\r\n\"Commissioner of Patents.\r\n\r\n\"R. H. GILLETT,\r\n\"Solicitor of the Treasury.\"\r\n\r\nThis evidence, taken in due form, and certified to by the magistrates in\r\nAugusta and Rockbridge Counties, Virginia, was _not_ ruled out as\r\ninformal, as we have seen it stated: but it was certainly laid before\r\nthe Board; and was doubtless satisfactory both as to priority of\r\ninvention, and in connection with Dr. Page's report, conclusive, \"that\r\nsaid patent ought not to be extended.\"\r\n\r\nWe have also seen it stated that Hussey appeared before the Board of\r\nExtensions \"to contest the extension of McCormick's patent.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Mr. Hussey Acted in Self Defense]\r\n\r\nWe think injustice--and no doubt unintentionally--is here done to\r\nHussey. Until the order of the Board was passed to afford him the\r\nopportunity to defend his rights, assailed without his knowledge, he was\r\nnot aware of C. H. McCormick's application. As a matter of course he\r\nthen attended, but stated in writing, and which is now on file, \"I had\r\nno intention, neither had I any desire to place any obstacle in the way\r\nof the extension of C. H. McCormick's patent. But the course he has\r\ntaken before your Board and before Congress has compelled me to act in\r\nself defense.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: McCormick Assailed the Hussey Extension]\r\n\r\nNot so with C. H. McCormick; for when his claims were rejected by the\r\nBoard of Extensions,--and most justly, as we think, in accordance with\r\nthe evidence--_he petitioned Congress against Hussey's extension_:\r\nand to this most ungenerous, illiberal and unfair course, and of which\r\nHussey was for years totally ignorant, C. H. McCormick may justly\r\nattribute this enquiry;--but for this, it had never been written. Our\r\nobject is not to injure C. H. McCormick; but it is that justice may be\r\ndone to another, whose interests and rights he was the first to assail.\r\n\r\nIf the foregoing testimony is not conclusive, as regards priority of\r\ninvention in 1831 against C. H. McCormick, we think the evidence which\r\nfollows--and which no one will pretend to call in question, or\r\ndoubt--establishes the fact that the machine of 1831 was good for\r\nnothing,--not even _half invented_; and that the machine of 1841\r\nwas not much more perfect.\r\n\r\nOn page 231 of the Reports of Juries for the Great London Exhibition,\r\nand now in the Library of Congress, we find the following:\r\n\r\n\"It seems right,\" says Philip Pusey, Esq., M. P., \"to put on record Mr.\r\nMcCormick's own account of his progress, or some extracts at least, from\r\na statement written by him, at my request.\"--[Pusey.]\r\n\r\n\"My father was a farmer in the county of Rockbridge, State of Virginia,\r\nUnited States. He made an experiment in cutting grain in the year 1816,\r\nby a number of cylinders standing perpendicularly. Another experiment of\r\nthe same kind was made by my father in the harvest of 1831, which\r\nsatisfied my father to abandon it. Thereupon my attention was directed\r\nto the subject, and the same harvest I invented and put in operation in\r\ncutting late oats on the farm of John Steele, adjoining my father's,\r\nthose parts of my present Reaper called the platform, for receiving the\r\ncorn, a straight blade taking effect on the corn, supported by\r\nstationary fingers over the edge, and a reel to gather the corn; which\r\nlast, however, I found had been used before, though not in the same\r\ncombination.\r\n\r\n\"Although these parts constituted the foundation of the present machine,\r\nI found in practice innumerable difficulties, being limited also to a\r\nfew weeks each year, during the harvest, for experimenting, so that my\r\nfirst patent for the Reaper was granted in June, 1834.\r\n\r\n\"During this interval, _I was often advised by my father and family to\r\nabandon it, and pursue my regular business, as likely to be more\r\nprofitable, he having given me a farm_. [Italicised by C. H. McC.]\r\n\r\n\"No machines were sold until 1840, and I may say that they were not of\r\nmuch practical value until the improvements of my second patent in 1845.\r\n\r\n\"These improvements consist in reversing the angle of the sickle teeth\r\nalternately--the improved form of the fingers to hold up the corn,\r\netc.--an iron case to preserve the sickles from clogging--and a better\r\nmode of separating the standing corn to be cut. Up to this period\r\nnothing but loss of time and money resulted from my efforts. The sale\r\nhas since steadily increased, and is now more than a thousand\r\nyearly.\"[2]\r\n\r\n      [2] \"The sale has since steadily increased, and is now more than a\r\n      thousand yearly.\" This was written in 1851, and by a little\r\n      calculation, we can readily estimate the \"yearly\" profits. In the\r\n      Circuit Court of the United States, at Albany, in the suit brought\r\n      by C. H. McCormick against Seymour & Morgan, in 1850, for an\r\n      alleged infringement of patent, it was proved on the oath of O. H.\r\n      Dormon, his partner, and also on the oath of H. A. Blakesley,\r\n      their clerk, that these Reapers only cost $36 to $37 to\r\n      manufacture. By the same evidence, the sales averaged from $110 to\r\n      $120 each machine; leaving a clear profit of at least $73. C. H.\r\n      McCormick first received a patent fee of $30 on each machine, then\r\n      three-fourths of the remainder in the division of profits. It\r\n      would thus appear, if these figures are correct--and they are all\r\n      sworn to--that C. H. McCormick realized full fifty thousand\r\n      dollars clear profit annually, with a margin of eight to ten\r\n      thousand dollars for commissions and bad debts in addition.\r\n\r\nIt would be just as conclusive and reasonable for the _father_ of C. H.\r\nMcCormick to claim at this day priority of invention for his Reaper\r\ninvented in 1816, \"by a number of cylinders standing perpendicularly;\"\r\nor for \"the invention made by my father in the harvest of 1831, which\r\nsatisfied my father to abandon it.\" This authority, high and official\r\nas all must admit it to be, [and italicised too, by the writer for a\r\nparticular object,] clearly proves that the invention of 1831 was an\r\nabortion; for if the principle was effective to cut one acre of grain\r\nproperly, any man of common sense knows that it was equally so to cut\r\none thousand acres; but so complete was the failure that, \"During this\r\ninterval\"--between 1831 and 1834--\"_I was often advised by my father and\r\nfamily to abandon it, and pursue my regular business, as likely to be\r\nmore profitable, he having given me a farm._\"\r\n\r\nAgain, \"No machines were sold until 1840, and I may say that they were\r\nnot of much practical value until the improvements of my second patent\r\nin 1845.\" What these improvements were we are also informed: \"These\r\nimprovements consist in reversing the angle of the sickle teeth\r\nalternately, the improved form of the fingers to hold up the corn,\r\netc.--an iron case to preserve the sickle from clogging, etc.--up to\r\nthis period nothing but loss of time and money resulted from my\r\nefforts.\"\r\n\r\nNor is it at all surprising; for until improvements were added, invented\r\nand long in successful operation by others, the machine would not work,\r\nand consequently no one would buy.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: McCormick's Pen More Effective Than His Reaper]\r\n\r\nThis letter is the most perfect and complete estopper to priority of\r\ninvention--not only for 1831, but to 1841 inclusive, if not to 1845, that\r\ncould be _penned_. His _pen_ cuts a \"cleaner swath,\" as we farmers say,\r\nthan ever did his Reaper; and this letter at least is certainly C. H.\r\nMcCormick's own \"invention,\" which no one else can lay any claim to. Yet,\r\nstrange as it may appear, he contended before the Board of Extensions in\r\norder to invalidate Hussey's Patent, that he invented a Reaping Machine\r\nnine years before! So has perpetual motion been invented a hundred\r\ntimes--in the estimation of the projectors; and by his own showing, and\r\non oath, he sold but two machines up to 1842--one of them conditionally\r\nsold--being _eleven_ years after the alleged invention, and even they had\r\nto be re-invented to make them work, or use the previous inventions of\r\nothers.\r\n\r\nIn this letter to Philip Pusey, Esq., M. P., C. H. McCormick admits that\r\nthe Reel \"had been used before,\" yet he includes it in his patent of\r\n1834.--Both the specifications and drawings in the Patent Office\r\nconclusively establish the fact that James Ten Eyck _patented_ the reel\r\nor \"revolving rack,\" or \"revolving frame\" in 1825, used not only to\r\n_gather_ the grain as all such devices are used, but by the knives\r\nattached to it, also intended to _cut it off_.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Priority of the Reel]\r\n\r\nCould it be contended that because _rockers_ are attached to a chair\r\nit is no longer a chair, or useful as a seat? Even \"Mary McCormick,\r\nthe mother of Cyrus,\" and \"Eliza H. Steele, of Steele's Tavern,\r\nVirginia\"--nay every woman and child in the country would tell you that\r\nit was then a _rocking_ chair--just as much a seat as ever--and Ten\r\nEyck's was a Reel to all intents and purposes, but also a _cutting_ reel.\r\nIt does not require the mechanical tact and skill of Professor Page to\r\ndiscover that \"the revolving rack presents novelty chiefly in form, as\r\nits operation is similar to the revolving frame of James Ten Eyck,\r\npatented November 2d, 1825.\" It is certain the reel was no \"novelty,\"\r\neither in 1831 or 1834, when patented by C. H. McCormick; _he_ tells us\r\nso himself; and it is most likely the father of C. H. McCormick also used\r\na reel for his \"cylinders standing perpendicularly, in 1816,\" and also\r\nfor his other plan in 1831, and \"which satisfied my father to abandon\r\nit.\" And it is equally probable that most of the \"fathers\" and the sons,\r\nwho invented Reapers for a hundred years preceding the date of Hussey's\r\npatent, used reels;--indeed the reel seemed to be considered a _Sine qua\r\nnon_ by many; most of the inventors we have any clear account of,\r\nresorted to the reel.\r\n\r\nHussey also used the reel in 1833--of course the reel and seat in\r\ncombination--but only for a short period, as it was found quite\r\nunnecessary--an actual incumbrance with _his_ cutting apparatus,\r\nand soon laid it aside.\r\n\r\nWe will now examine another invention patented by C. H. McCormick, in\r\n1847. We here assert and challenge a denial, that from 12 to 14 years\r\nafter the alleged invention of a Reaper by C. H. McCormick in 1831, and\r\nfrom 9 to 12 years after the date of his patent in 1834 his _raker\r\nwalked_ by the side of his machine, while Hussey's raker _rode on the\r\nmachine as they always had done_ since his first machine that cut the\r\ngrain like \"a thing of life\" in Hamilton County, Ohio, in 1833. Yet, in\r\n1847, C. H. McCormick takes out a patent for the _raker's seat_! this\r\n_was_ a \"novelty\" and well worth a patent!\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Raker's Seat]\r\n\r\nIn two trials of reaping machines by Hussey and McCormick in the same\r\nfields in Virginia, in 1843, one at Hutchinson's, and the other on the\r\nplantation of the late Senator Roane, at Tree Hill, near Richmond,\r\nMcCormick's raker _walked_ by the side of the machine, while Hussey's\r\n_rode_ on the machine, in the same manner as he did just exactly ten\r\nyears before.\r\n\r\nWe have three letters from the late Hon. William H. Roane referring to\r\nthese trials, and ordering a machine from Hussey, after witnessing the\r\noperation of both. Two of the letters he desired might not be published;\r\nbut says in one of them, \"I have no objection to your stating publicly\r\nthat a _member_ of the committee who made the report last summer at\r\n_Hutchinson's_, which was published a few days thereafter, witnessed a\r\nfuller and fairer trial between the two machines, and has in consequence\r\nordered one of yours. * * * What I have said above of ---- is intended\r\nonly for your eye _confidentially_, to show you in part the character and\r\nprobable motives of the opposition your Reaper has met. Let what I say be\r\nprivate, as I have a great objection to going into the newspapers. Should\r\nyou ever want it, you can have from me the strongest public testimonial\r\nof my good opinion of your machine.\"\r\n\r\nThe third letter, giving this \"testimonial,\" was published in the\r\nAmerican Farmer in January, 1844. As the Raker's Seat--the main feature\r\nof C. H. McCormick's patent of 1847--comes fairly within the scope of\r\nthis enquiry as to priority of invention, we re-publish Senator Roane's\r\nletter and also furnish other testimony on the subject.\r\n\r\n    \"_To the Editor of the American Farmer:_\r\n\r\n    \"As the question of _which is the best Reaping Machine_ is of\r\n    no little importance to wheat growers, it is highly necessary that\r\n    they be rightly informed of every fact which tends to decide the\r\n    question. The trial which forms the subject of the following\r\n    correspondence was looked forward to with great interest by\r\n    farmers; such was the partial character of the trial, and the\r\n    general terms of the committee's report, in which the particulars\r\n    that led to the result were omitted, it cannot appear strange that\r\n    the public should be in some degree misled with regard to the\r\n    relative merits of the two machines.

Averse as I am to having my name in print on _this_, or\r\n    any other occasion, I cannot with propriety decline a response to\r\n    your inquiry. I had never seen or formed an idea of a reaping\r\n    machine until I went to Hutchinson's--I was surprised and delighted\r\n    with the performance of each of them, and fully resolved to own one\r\n    of them by the _next_ harvest, but their performance that day left\r\n    me in a state of doubt which I should select. The report spoke in\r\n    terms of high praise of each machine, and I consented to its award\r\n    that _on the whole_ Mr. McCormick's was preferable, merely because\r\n    being the cheapest and requiring but two horses, it would best suit\r\n    the majority of our farmers, who make small crops of wheat on _weak\r\n    land_--for I doubted its capacity in _heavy_ grain. After this\r\n    report was made I heard your complaint that you did not have a fair\r\n    trial, because being unable to bring into the field your large\r\n    improved Reaper, which was up the river, you were compelled to\r\n    comply with your _engagement_ for the day, with a _small_ and\r\n    _inferior_ machine, drawn by an indifferent and untutored team. Mr.\r\n    Hutchinson's wheat was badly rusted, and therefore light. I had\r\n    ready for the scythe a low ground field of heavy and well matured\r\n    grain; partly to expedite my harvest work, and partly to renew the\r\n    trial, that I might solve my doubts as to the merits of these\r\n    machines, I succeeded in engaging them to be at Tree Hill on a\r\n    named day. They both came agreeable to appointment, Mr. McCormick\r\n    bringing the machine he used at Hutchinson's, and you bringing the\r\n    one you could not on that occasion bring down the river. The day\r\n    was fine, and both machines did their best, and had a very fair\r\n    trial. My doubts were fully removed, and my mind convinced that for\r\n    the heavy wheat we raise on our river low grounds, rich bottoms,\r\n    etc., _your_ machine is superior to Mr. McCormick's, of which I\r\n    still think highly. I accordingly ordered one of yours to be made\r\n    for the approaching harvest.\r\n\r\n    \"I wish you all possible success in cutting hemp in the 'Great\r\n    West.' It must be very desirable to cut that valuable plant instead\r\n    of pulling it up by the roots, and I cannot doubt that your reaper\r\n    has ample _power_ for the process.\r\n\r\n    \"Most respectfully, yours, etc.,\r\n\r\n    \"W. H. ROANE.\r\n\r\n    \"Mr. Obed Hussey, Baltimore.\"\r\n\r\n\"We are not advised at what precise period subsequent to 1843 and\r\nprevious to 1847 (when C. H. McCormick patented the raker's seat), that\r\nhe changed the arrangement of his wheels, etc., so as to admit a seat for\r\nhis raker without 'tipping up the machine' as was unavoidable previously.\r\nFrom evidence deemed fully reliable, _he_ was not the first even on his\r\nown machine, to provide a seat for the raker, \"and all take a ride.' It\r\nis laborious enough to test fully the endurance of the most powerful and\r\nmuscular man, to _ride_ and _rake_; but to _walk_ and _rake_ is even more\r\nbarbarous than the old time ball and chain to the leg of the felon. The\r\nconsiderate and feeling farmer would certainly 'wait for the wagon' to be\r\nbetter fixed before thus undertaking to reap his grain fields if himself\r\nor his hands had to _ride_ in this sort of style.\r\n\r\n\"We have a letter from Isaac Irvine Hite, Esq., now of Clarke County,\r\nVa., which throws some light on the subject; he says (italicised by the\r\nwriter):\r\n\r\n\"In 1842 my father, by my request, purchased for me of _C. H. McCormick_\r\nand _Father_, a reaper at $110, which was _drawn_ by two horses, and it\r\nwas raked off to the right hand side by a _man on foot_. The father of C.\r\nH. McCormick stated to me at the commencement of that harvest, that it\r\nhad been _nine years since they_ had first operated with it, in pretty\r\nmuch the form it was then constructed. On a recent visit to Messrs.\r\nMcCormick, who then resided on the line between Augusta and Rockbridge\r\nCounties in this State, the old gentleman stated to me that _he_ had been\r\nat _odd_ times at work on the reaper for many years; and either he or his\r\nson stated to me that C. H. McCormick had been _improving_, _changing_ or\r\n_inventing_ various parts until they had (as they thought) perfected the\r\nmachine. * * * I disliked the labor _imposed on the hand who had to walk\r\nand remove_ the wheat from a platform seven feet in width, and urged\r\nMessrs. McCormick to attach another contrivance so as to enable the raker\r\nto ride and perform his arduous task; the old gentleman contended that\r\nthat could never be accomplished, but that a self-operating appendage\r\ncould be constructed to remove the grain, but that would be uncertain,\r\nand entirely unreliable. During my visit, he pointed out to me _one_ or\r\n_more_ fixtures they had tried for the raker to ride on. I think one was\r\non one wheel, and the other on two.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Mr. Hite Suggests a Seat]\r\n\r\nI yet contended that it could be accomplished; if by no other means, by\r\nchanging the construction of the machine, and remarked to him, if I were\r\na mechanic, and understood the construction of the machine well enough\r\nto venture to alter its parts, I was certain I could so arrange it, and\r\nrequested him to urge his son to make the effort; he replied that it\r\nwould be useless; that they had tried every imaginable way or plan\r\nbefore placing the machine before the public, and that they regarded it\r\nas an impossibility, successfully, and properly, in any other way than\r\non foot, and said it was necessary for the heads to be brought round to\r\nthe right, in which I fully agreed; but contended it could be done while\r\nthe raker was riding or standing in an erect position.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: McCormick Condemns]\r\n\r\nAfter this unsatisfactory interview I returned home, and at the close of\r\nthe next wheat harvest I had a small carriage, about 3 feet by 3-1/2\r\nfeet, constructed on two wheels, and connected underneath the platform,\r\nby means of shafts to the back part of the head of the machine; this\r\nduring the cutting of my oat crop answered every purpose, so far as the\r\nraker was concerned, but there was a difficulty in turning. C. H.\r\nMcCormick came to see this combination sometime during the year, and\r\ncondemned it in toto. But by the next harvest I had it so constructed, as\r\nto be drawn by an iron bar so shaped, appended and supported on the\r\nunderneath part of the carriage, as to admit of the machine turning in\r\nany direction, and the carriage would follow just as the two hind wheels\r\nof a wagon do; the carriage had a seat behind, and a thick, deep cushion\r\nin front, for the raker to press his knees against while removing the\r\ngrain from the platform to his right hand, which he was enabled to do\r\nwith apparent ease with a _rake of peculiar shape_;--(it cannot be done\r\nwith a rake of ordinary shape).\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: McCormick Adopts Mr. Hite's Suggestion]\r\n\r\nThe working of the first carriage was witnessed by many gentlemen who\r\napproved of it; and the combination of the second carriage I applied for\r\na patent for. The model carriage can now be seen in the room of the\r\nPatent Office, containing models of all rejected patents. After this, I\r\nheard of McCormick making experiments at one of his Western factories--I\r\nthink it was at Chicago; and finally he addressed me _a letter,\r\nstating he had changed the construction of his machine, and had it so\r\nconstructed that the raker could ride on the machine and remove the\r\ngrain_.\"\r\n\r\nWe think the foregoing letter--for it carries truth on its face--clearly\r\nshows that the idea of \"changing the construction of the machine,\" and\r\npermit the raker to ride, did not originate with the McCormick's father\r\nor son; for \"they had tried every imaginable plan or way before placing\r\nthe machine before the public, and that they regarded it as an\r\nimpossibility for the wheat to be so removed regularly, successfully and\r\nproperly, in any other way except on foot.\"\r\n\r\nAt the trial referred to at Hutchinson's, and the late Senator Roane's\r\nin 1843, it was demonstrated that a raker could ride and rake, and as\r\nwas also done by Hussey many years before, at various places, and\r\ndelivering the grain at back or side. But we have still better evidence\r\nthan the above--C. H. McCormick himself.\r\n\r\nHis Patent of 1847, covering some four or five folio pages, is altogether\r\nto change \"the construction of the machine,\" to admit of, and to patent\r\nthe raker's seat; the substance of the whole is comprised within the\r\nfollowing brief extract from the patent of 1847:\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: McCormick's Patent for Raker's Seat]\r\n\r\n\"And the gearing which communicates motion to the crank is placed back\r\nof the driving wheel, which is therefore subject to be clogged by sand,\r\ndirt, straw, etc.--_and in consequence of the relative position of the\r\nvarious parts, the attendant is obliged to walk on the ground by the\r\nside of the machine, to rake the cut grain from the platform as it is\r\ndelivered and laid there by the reel_. These defects which have so\r\nmuch retarded the introduction into practical and general use of Reaping\r\nMachines, I have remedied by my improvements, the nature of which\r\nconsists in placing the driving wheels further back than heretofore, and\r\nback of the gearing which communicates motion to the sickle, which is\r\nplaced in a line back of the axis of the driving wheel, the connexion\r\nbeing formed, etc., and also bringing the driving wheel sufficiently far\r\nback _to balance the frame of the machine with the raker on it_, to\r\nmake room for him to sit or stand on the frame,\" etc., etc.--\"_which\r\ncannot be done, if the raker walks by the side of the machine, as\r\nheretofore_.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Hussey Fourteen Years Ahead]\r\n\r\nNow if C. H. McCormick's testimony in his own favor, can be considered\r\nreliable, he certainly had not _invented_ a seat for his raker as late as\r\n1845--and not long prior to 1847, when he patented it; and just _fourteen\r\nyears_ after Hussey had used it _every year_, successively. The raker's\r\nseat therefore was just as _original_ an invention as the reel.\r\n\r\nThe \"straight sickle blade,\" but cut one way only, and abandoned some 10\r\nor 12 years after its conception in 1831, as he states, appears to be\r\nthe only original idea--properly belonging to whom it may--in the patent\r\nof 1834. As to the \"foundation\" of the machine, viz:--the platform, cog\r\nwheels, crank, etc., etc., they have been used by every projector in\r\nreaping machines, for a century.\r\n\r\nA machine exhibited at the World's Fair in London, by C. H. McCormick,\r\nhad the \"straight sickle blade,\" but alternating the cuts every few\r\ninches. With such a machine it is impracticable to cut grain, much less\r\ngrass, efficiently, divested of the reel. That plan has since been\r\nchanged to a much more efficient blade, the scolloped edged sickle. That\r\nit was used in the Northwestern States by others several years previous\r\nto its adoption by C. H. McCormick, we believe admits of just as little\r\ndoubt, as rests with the priority of invention of the Reel, Rakers-seat,\r\netc.\r\n\r\nThere is one other important feature, patented in 1845 and referred to in\r\nthe Pusey letter;--an \"Iron case to preserve the sickles from clogging;\"\r\nthese we will also take a look into after a while.\r\n\r\nObed Hussey, as appears by the evidence before us, made his first machine\r\nin Cincinnati, Ohio, where he then resided, in the spring of 1833, and it\r\nwas patented the same year.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Hussey Principle]\r\n\r\nHis principle--the arrangement and construction of the Guards and\r\nKnives--was precisely identical with those used by him at the present\r\nday, except an improvement patented in 1847, leaving openings at the\r\nback end of the slot in the guards for the escape of particles of straw\r\nor grass that might get in between the blades and guards.\r\n\r\nIt was communicated at the time by letter with a diagram to a personal\r\nfriend now living, and of the highest respectability, from whom we have\r\na certificate, and copy of the drawing. The knives or cutters, for lack\r\nof more suitable materials were made out of hand saw blades cut into\r\nsuitable form, and riveted to a bar, vibrating through an opening or\r\nslot in the guards.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: An Early Experiment]\r\n\r\nJudge Foster, residing within a few miles of the city, and to whom he\r\napplied, kindly offered him every facility to test the machine by cutting\r\ngrain, ripe and unripe, being himself greatly interested in its success.\r\nWhen taken to the field, a considerable number of persons were attracted\r\nto the spot; and rather to the discomfiture of the inventor, for it may\r\nwell be supposed it was an anxious moment to him, and he desired _no\r\nwitnesses to his failure_. The machine was started; but owing to some\r\npart giving away, or some slight defect not apparent until then, it\r\nfailed to work satisfactorily. One burley fellow present picked up a\r\ncradle, and, swinging it with an air of great exultation, exclaimed,\r\n\"this is the machine to cut the wheat!\"\r\n\r\nAfter the jeers and merriment of the crowd had somewhat subsided, the\r\ninventor remedied the defect, and assisted by the laborers present--the\r\nhorses having been removed--pulled the machine to the top of an adjacent\r\nhill; when alone, he drew the machine down the hill, and through the\r\nstanding grain, when it cut every head clean in its track!\r\n\r\nThe _same_ machine was directly afterwards exhibited before the Hamilton\r\nCounty Agricultural Society near Carthage, on the 2nd of July, 1833. Of\r\nits operation and success, the following statements, and certificates,\r\nnow in our possession, sufficiently testify. Doctor Wallace as well as\r\nsome others of the gentlemen, are living witnesses of what is here\r\nstated.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Wallace Testimonial]\r\n\r\n    Cincinnati, November 20th, 1833.\r\n\r\n    This may certify that I was present on the 2nd day of July near\r\n    Carthage, in this county, at an experimental trial with a machine\r\n    invented by Mr. Obed Hussey for cutting grain. The operation was\r\n    performed on a field of wheat. The machine was found to cut the\r\n    wheat clean, and with great rapidity. But owing to its having been\r\n    imperfectly made, being only constructed for the experiment, some\r\n    parts of _wood_ which should have been made of iron, and in\r\n    consequence frequently getting some parts out of order, a correct\r\n    estimate of the quantity of work it would perform in a given time\r\n    could not be made. One point was, however, satisfactorily\r\n    established, that the principle upon which the machine is\r\n    constructed will operate; and when well built will be an important\r\n    improvement, and greatly facilitate the harvesting of grain. I\r\n    would also remark that the horses moving the machine were walked,\r\n    and trotted, and it was found to cut best with the greatest\r\n    velocity.\r\n\r\n    C. D. WALLACE,\r\n    Secretary of the Hamilton County Agricultural Society.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Exceeded Expectations]\r\n\r\n    We, the undersigned, witnessed the exhibition of Mr. O. Hussey's\r\n    Machine for cutting grain alluded to by Dr. Wallace, and do fully\r\n    concur with his statement of its performance. We would further add,\r\n    that notwithstanding its temporary construction, its performance far\r\n    exceeded our expectations. Cutting the grain clean and rapidly, and\r\n    leaving it in good order for binding. We are of the opinion that the\r\n    machine is capable of being propelled at the rate of five miles the\r\n    hour, and do good work. The machine was worked when the cutters were\r\n    both in a sharp and a dull condition, and no difference could be\r\n    perceived in its execution.\r\n\r\n    (Signed) \"G. A.

It was propelled by two horses, and cut as fast as eight\r\npersons could conveniently bind, doing the cutting neatly.\r\n\r\n\"This machine is the invention of Mr. O. Hussey, and will no doubt prove\r\na useful addition to our agricultural implements. Mr. J. C. Ludlow\r\nsuggested that it would be good economy of time and labor to take a\r\nthreshing machine into the field and thresh out the grain as it is\r\nreaped, thereby saving the binding and hauling to the barn or stack. We\r\nthink the suggestion a good one.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Problem Solved]\r\n\r\nHere, then, was the problem solved--the great discovery made that had\r\npuzzled the brains of hundreds if not of thousands, and for centuries.\r\nNo one we fearlessly assert had ever succeeded so completely and\r\nsatisfactorily, and with so simple and practical a machine.\r\n\r\nSome visited the exhibition determined to condemn as they afterwards\r\nacknowledged, deeming the thing impracticable; but all were convinced;\r\nfor the demonstration was of that character which left no room for doubt\r\nor cavil in the minds of any.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A Great Triumph]\r\n\r\nIt was indeed a triumph,--not perhaps entirely unexpected to the\r\ninventor--but neither he, nor any one else at that early day, could\r\nforesee the wonderful changes ultimately to be effected, and the\r\nworld-wide renown to be conferred on the inventor as the result of this\r\nexperiment; one that was certain to immortalize his name as a pioneer\r\nand benefactor in the most useful and peaceful pursuits in life. It was\r\ntoo, the dawn of a brighter day to the toiling husbandman, by lightening\r\nhis labors, and adding to his comfort and independence; only\r\ncircumscribed in its beneficial influence by the bounds of civilization.\r\n\r\nSome may possibly suppose that we view the invention in too glowing\r\ncolors; but we have yet to meet with the farmer who owned a good reaping\r\nand mowing machine that would dispense with its advantages for twice the\r\ncost of the implement, and again be compelled to resort to the sickle,\r\nthe cradle, and the scythe; for of a truth it completely supersedes all\r\nthree in competent hands and with fair usage, in both the grain and\r\ngrass crops.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: No Competitors Until 1841]\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to confine our narrative to its intended brief limits and\r\nselect from the mass of evidence on hand as to the uninterrupted success\r\noff Hussey's invaluable invention from that day to the present--now\r\ntwenty-one years. We will therefore only select a single and short\r\naccount of each year; until about 1840 or '42; not long after which a few\r\nother inventors came before the public. There was, however, no competitor\r\nin the field from 1833 to 1841 or 1842, either in Europe or America, so\r\nfar as we can ascertain, that did more than make a few occasional trials;\r\nnone attracted public attention, or were successful and efficient\r\nmachines even in the estimation of the projectors themselves. The\r\nevidence proves it, and it is corroborated by our own personal knowledge,\r\nhaving been constantly engaged in Agricultural and Mechanical pursuits\r\nfor more than thirty years--and, as we believe, familiar with most of the\r\nimportant improvements of the age;--of all in fact, directly connected\r\nwith agriculture in its labor saving implements, of any notoriety.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: No Reaping Machine Without Hussey Principle]\r\n\r\nMany alleged improvements have been made in the Reaper in the past ten\r\nor twelve years; and many more still within half that period. How far\r\nthey are new inventions, and actual _improvements_, we can better\r\njudge by examining Hussey's patent; for it describes the cutting\r\napparatus clearly and minutely, and which in fact is the whole\r\nthing,--the \"one thing needful\" to success. For the use of wheels, or a\r\nsystem of gearing to all kinds of motive machinery is coeval with the\r\nfirst dawn of mechanical science. How ancient we know not, for the\r\nProphets of old spoke of \"wheels within wheels\" near three thousand\r\nyears ago; and it is very certain the hand of man, unaided by wheels and\r\nmachinery, never erected the vast Pyramids and other structures of\r\nantiquity. We do not believe there is a single Reaping and Mowing\r\nmachine in successful operation on this continent that is not mainly\r\nindebted to Hussey's invention in the cutting apparatus, for its\r\nsuccess: deprive them of this essential feature--disrobe them of their\r\nborrowed plumes, and their success would be like the flight of the\r\neagle, suddenly bereft of his pinions,--he must fall; and the machines\r\nwould stand still, for not a farmer in the land would use them.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Guards]\r\n\r\nAs previously remarked, O. Hussey's first patent is dated in 1833. We\r\nomit the more general description of the machine, and copy only what\r\nembraces the most important features, the guards and knives; also an\r\nextract from his improvement patented in 1847, to obviate choking in the\r\nguards:\r\n\r\n\"On the front edge of the platform is fixed the cutting or reaping\r\napparatus, which is constructed in the following manner: A series of\r\niron spikes, and which I will call _guards_, are fixed permanently\r\nto the platform, and extend seven or eight inches, more or less, beyond\r\nthe edge of the platform, parallel to each other, horizontal, and\r\npointing forward. These guards are about three inches apart, of a\r\nsuitable size, say three-quarters of an inch square, more or less, at\r\nthe base, and lessening towards the points. The guards are formed of a\r\ntop and bottom piece, joined at the point and near the back, being\r\nnearly parallel, and about one-eighth of an inch apart, forming a\r\nhorizontal mortice or slit through the guard; these mortices being on a\r\nline with each other, form a continued range of openings or slits\r\nthrough the guards. The first guard is placed on the rear of the right\r\nwheel, and the last at the extreme end of the platform, and the\r\nintermediate guards at equal distances from each other, and three inches\r\napart, more or less, from center to center.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Diagram Showing Arrangement of Guards and Knives]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Cutter]\r\n\r\n\"The cutter or saw (f) is formed of thin triangular plates of steel\r\nfastened to a straight _flat rod_, (g) of steel, iron or wood, one inch\r\nand a half wide; these steel plates are arranged side by side, forming a\r\nkind of saw with teeth three inches at the base, and four and a half\r\ninches long, more or less, sharp on both sides, and terminating nearly in\r\na point. The saw is then passed through all the guards in the aforesaid\r\nrange of mortices, the size of the mortice being suited to receive the\r\nsaw with the teeth pointing forward; observing always that the points of\r\nthe saw teeth should correspond with the center of the guards. One end of\r\nthe saw is connected with a pitman moved by a crank, and receiving its\r\nmotion from the main axis, by one or two sets of cog wheels. The\r\nvibration of this crank must be equal to the distances of the centers of\r\nthe guards, or the points of the saw teeth, or thereabouts, so when the\r\nmachine is in motion, the point of each saw tooth may pass from center to\r\ncenter of the guards on each side of the same tooth at every vibration of\r\nthe crank; if the main wheels are three feet four inches in diameter,\r\nthey should in one revolution give the crank sixteen vibrations, more or\r\nless; the saw teeth should play clear of the guards, both above and\r\nbelow. * * *\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Operation]\r\n\r\n\"The power is given by locking the wheels to the main axis, the machine\r\nhas one square wheel box, the other round and locked at pleasure. If the\r\npower should be wanted, one, two, or more horses are attached and driven\r\non the stubble before the machine, the right wheel running near the\r\nstanding grain, the platform with the saw in its front edge extends on\r\nthe right, at right angles with the direction of the horses, with the\r\nguards and saw teeth presented to the standing grain--when the machine\r\nmoves forward, the saw moves with the teeth endwise and horizontal, the\r\ngrain or grass is brought between the guards, the saw teeth in passing\r\nthrough the guards, cut the stalk while held both above and below the\r\nsaw--the butts of the grain receive an impulse forward by the motion of\r\nthe machine while in the act of being cut, which causes the heads of the\r\ngrain to fall directly backwards on the platform--in this manner the\r\nplatform receives the grain until a sufficient quantity is collected to\r\nmake one or more bundles, according to the pleasure of the operator,\r\nthen it is deposited with a proper instrument by the operator, _who\r\nmay ride on the machine_.\"\r\n\r\nHere follows the dimensions of a machine suited to two horses, which is\r\nonly copied so far as refers to the cutting apparatus, viz: \"The back of\r\nthe saw may be from one inch to one and one-half inches wide, and from\r\nthree-sixteenths to one-quarter of an inch thick; and the steel plates\r\nfor the teeth should be about one-tenth of an inch thick; one end of the\r\nmortice in the guard should be fitted to receive the back of the saw, so\r\nthat the bearing may be on the back of the saw only.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Gearing of Hussey's Early Reapers.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Four Essentials]\r\n\r\n\"In this machine the following points are claimed as new and original:\r\n1st. The straight horizontal saw, with the teeth sharp on their two\r\nsides for cutting grain. 2d. The guards forming double bearers above and\r\nbelow the saw, whereby the cutting is made sure, whether with a sharp or\r\ndull edge, the guards at the same time protecting the saw from rocks or\r\nstones, or other large substances it may meet with. 3d. The peculiar\r\nconstruction that the saw teeth may run free, whereby the necessary\r\npressure and consequent friction of two corresponding edges cutting\r\ntogether, as on the principle of scissors, is entirely avoided. 4th. The\r\npeculiar arrangement by which the horses are made to go before the\r\nmachine, being more natural, and greatly facilitating the use of the\r\nmachine, and the general arrangement of the points as above described.\r\n\r\n\"In cutting grass, the platform is reduced in width, and the grass falls\r\non the ground as it is cut.\"\r\n\r\nIn the improvement of the guards patented in 1847, the claim states: \"I\r\naccordingly claim the opening above the blades A, fig. 3, and at D, fig.\r\n1, in combination with vibrating blades. I also claim the particular\r\napplication of the flush edge at the fork of the blades, for the purpose\r\ndescribed.\r\n\r\n\"The end and design of the improvements above claimed is to prevent the\r\nblades choking.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: McCormick Twelve Years Late]\r\n\r\n_En passant_, we would ask any intelligent and candid farmer or mechanic\r\nwho has examined a successful reaper, to compare the foregoing plain\r\nspecifications which all can understand, with the cutting apparatus of\r\nthe most successful modern machine. And we would especially desire him to\r\ncompare them in principle with the \"improved form of fingers to hold up\r\nthe corn, and an iron case to preserve the sickles from clogging;\" not\r\nthe alleged invention of 1831, by C. H. McCormick, and abandoned from\r\n1840 to 1843, but the claims patented by him in 1845 [as stated in the\r\nletter to Philip Pusey, M. P.], twelve years after the date of Hussey's\r\npatent, and twelve years after his most complete and uninterrupted\r\nsuccess in cutting both grain and grass. In fact, there was no year from\r\nand including 1833 up to 1854, a period of 21 years the past harvest,\r\nthat we have not the most positive and conclusive evidence of the success\r\nof Hussey's reaper; in numerous cases the same machines had cut from 500\r\nto 800, and even one thousand acres; in one instance, the same machine\r\nwas used for fourteen harvests, or as many years, successively and\r\nsuccessfully.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Canfield Testimonial]\r\n\r\nWe have given some of the evidence for 1833. For 1834 we annex two\r\nletters giving an account of the two machines made this year, one in\r\nIllinois, and the other in New York, viz:\r\n\r\n    \"Spring Creek, Sangamon Co., Ill.,\r\n    \"October 1st, 1854.\r\n\r\n    \"_Mr. Obed Hussey, Baltimore:_\r\n\r\n    \"Dear Sir:--Your favor of August 10th came to hand a few days\r\n    since.

The only objection I recollect being made, was,\r\n    that when the straw was wet, or there was much green grass among\r\n    the wheat, the blades would choke. You certainly demonstrated in\r\n    1834 the practicability of cutting grain or grass with horse-power;\r\n    and all the machines since introduced seem to have copied your machine\r\n    in all its essential features.\r\n\r\n    \"I am respectfully yours,\r\n\r\n    \"JOHN E. CANFIELD.\"\r\n\r\nThe next letter we copy from the _Genesee Farmer_ of December 6th, 1834.\r\nThe reader will readily perceive that the author, William C. Dwight, knew\r\nhow to handle the pen as well as the plow, and equally well to work the\r\nreaper, being a practical farmer. But we are pained to add that he lost\r\nhis life by the fatal railroad accident at Norwalk, Ct., about a year\r\nsince.\r\n\r\nFrom the Genesee Farmer, December 6, 1834.\r\n\r\n    \"_To the Editor of the Genesee Farmer:_\r\n\r\n    \"I wrote you last May that Mr. _Hussey_, the inventor of a\r\n    machine for harvesting wheat, had left in this village one of his\r\n    machines for the purpose of giving our farmers an opportunity to\r\n    test its value, and I promised to write you further about it when\r\n    it had been put to use. For many reasons which will not interest\r\n    either yourself or the public, the matter has been delayed till\r\n    the first rainy day, after my fall work was out of the way, should\r\n    give leisure to remember and fulfill my promise.\r\n\r\n    \"The machine has been fully tried, and I am gratified to be able\r\n    to say that it has fully succeeded; hundreds of farmers from the\r\n    different towns of this and the adjoining counties have witnessed\r\n    its operations, and all have not only expressed their confidence\r\n    in its success, but their gratification in the perfection of the\r\n    work.\r\n\r\n    \"As every inquirer asks the same series of questions, I presume\r\n    your readers will have a like course of thought, and wish for\r\n    satisfaction in the same particulars. To give them this, I will\r\n    write them in their order, and give the answers:\r\n\r\n    \"Does the machine make clean work?\r\n\r\n    \"It saves all the grain. To use the language of a gratified\r\n    looker-on, an old and experienced farmer, 'it cheats the hogs.'[3]\r\n\r\n      [3] The hogs are the gleaners in this section of country.\r\n\r\n    \"Does the machine expedite the work?\r\n\r\n    \"What the machine is capable of accomplishing, we who have used it\r\n    can hardly say, as we had no field in fit order, large enough for\r\n    a fair trial through a whole day; and can only say what it has\r\n    done. Five acres of heavy wheat, on the Genesee flats, were\r\n    harvested in two hours and a quarter.\r\n\r\n    \"In what condition is the wheat left, and how is the work done\r\n    where the wheat is lodged?\r\n\r\n    \"The machine leaves the wheat in gavels large enough for a sheaf,\r\n    and where grain stands well enough to make fair work with the\r\n    cradle, it leaves the straw in as good condition to bind as the\r\n    gavels of a good reaper. Whether the grain stands or is lodged is\r\n    of little consequence, except as to the appearance of the sheaf,\r\n    and the necessity of saving more straw, when lodged, than is\r\n    desirable. The condition of the sheaf when the grain is lodged\r\n    depends much upon the adroitness of the raker.\r\n\r\n    \"What number of hands, and what strength of team is necessary to\r\n    manage the machine advantageously?\r\n\r\n    \"Two men, one to drive the team and the other to rake off the\r\n    wheat, and two horses, work the machine; but when the grain is\r\n    heavy, or the land mellow, a change of horses is necessary, as the\r\n    gait of the horses is too rapid to admit of heavy draft. The\r\n    horses go at the rate of four to five miles an hour, and when the\r\n    growth of straw is not heavy a fair trot of the team is not too\r\n    much.\r\n\r\n    \"Is the machine liable to derangement and destruction from its own\r\n    motion?\r\n\r\n    \"This is a question which cannot be so directly answered as the\r\n    others. We have only used the machine to cut about fifty acres,\r\n    and have had no trouble; judging from appearances so far, should\r\n    say it was as little subject to this evil as any machinery\r\n    whatever. The wear upon the cutting part being so little as to\r\n    require not more than fifteen minutes sharpening in a day; there\r\n    is no loss of time on this score.\r\n\r\n    \"Is the sheaf a good one to thresh?\r\n\r\n    \"The man who has fed the threshing machine with the grain of\r\n    twenty acres cut by this machine, says the sheaves are much better\r\n    than those of cradled grain, and quite as good as those of a\r\n    reaper.\r\n\r\n    \"There is one more advantage beyond ordinary inquiries, of\r\n    consequence, where so much grain is raised as in this valley; be\r\n    the grain ever so ripe, there is no waste of grain by any\r\n    agitation of the straw, and all the waste which can take place\r\n    must arise from the handling and shaking in binding.\r\n\r\n    \"I am yours, etc.,\r\n\r\n    \"WM.

The draft was thus (here\r\n    follows a diagram of the cutting apparatus exactly as described by\r\n    the patent) and the description was, that these knives were to\r\n    work by the motion of the wheels, being a perfect description of\r\n    the invented principle.\r\n\r\n    \"As soon as I saw the plan, I was satisfied of its success and\r\n    wrote to you that there was no doubt of the success of your\r\n    machine; that it was astonishing the world had so many thousand\r\n    years been confined to the sickle when so obvious a mode of\r\n    cutting grain and grass existed; and shortly after you obtained a\r\n    patent for the machine.\r\n\r\n    \"On the 6th July, 1835, you brought to Palmyra two of your\r\n    machines, and they were put in operation near this place--one in a\r\n    meadow between here and Philadelphia, and one in the heavy grass\r\n    in Marion City bottom.[4] The machines did cut well. I was the\r\n    editor of the _Missouri Courier_, from the month of November,\r\n    1833, until 1838, and brought your machine before the public; it\r\n    excited much attention, and its performance was highly\r\n    satisfactory. The results of the trials were published in the\r\n    paper by me in August or September, 1835. I knew of the capacity\r\n    of the machine, and that it did so execute in the bottom three\r\n    acres an hour. In this I cannot be mistaken, for I felt at the\r\n    time the deepest interest in the success of the machine.

The fame of his reaping exploits in the State of New York, and the\r\nfar West, had reached the East; though with something like a \"snail's\r\npace.\" We had not then the Magnetic Telegraph, which with lightning speed\r\nenables the East to _talk_ with the West; nor even the \"iron horse,\" by\r\nwhose speed and power, the reaper that cut a large crop of wheat in\r\nMaryland, could within the same week cut another equally large in the\r\nvalley of the Mississippi; but it then required some two to three _years_\r\nto prepare the public mind for the reception of the machine here; and\r\nowing to the limited means of the inventor, the transportation from place\r\nto place was often done by a single horse; accompanied by the inventor\r\nfoot-sore and weary from walking hundreds of miles!\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: An Inventor's Difficulties]\r\n\r\nThe annexed certificate was given, published, and widely circulated\r\nafter a full trial of the machine, in cutting more than two hundred\r\nacres, and by large farmers and practical men, known throughout the\r\nState. Comment is unnecessary on such a paper; but we feel bound to\r\nstate that it was mainly owing to the exertions of the liberal public\r\nspirited gentlemen, the last, though not the least of the signers, Gen.\r\nTench Tilghman, that the Reaper was then introduced into this State. He\r\nwas the early and steadfast friend of the Patentee, and to the cause of\r\nagricultural improvement in our State. Strange as it may appear to many\r\nat the present day, and notwithstanding these demonstrations in Ohio,\r\nIllinois, New York, Missouri and Maryland, which did not admit of cavil\r\nor doubt as to the entire efficiency and success of Hussey's reaper,\r\nscarcely a farmer could be found ready and willing to take hold of it,\r\nand aid the inventor in introducing it into use. But farmers as a class\r\nare proverbially cautious, and disinclined to change from established\r\ncustoms and usages; it often requires \"line upon line and precept upon\r\nprecept,\" aided, too, by almost a free gift of the article, to induce\r\nthem even to give a new agricultural implement a fair trial,--a plough,\r\nfor instance, that will do better work, with a fourth to a third less\r\ndraught; the old and nearly worn out implement \"does well enough.\" Gen.\r\nT. was, we believe, the first farmer in Maryland to use and purchase a\r\nreaping machine; and by so doing, to aid the inventive genius and talent\r\nof his countrymen, and also at the same time greatly to benefit the\r\ninterest of his brother farmers. It avails little to the inventor, or\r\nthe public, how valuable his improvement may be,--for in nine cases out\r\nof ten the inventor is limited in means,--if none can be found who are\r\nboth able and willing to lend a helping hand to modest merit; for true\r\ngenius is ever modest; and unfortunately the term is too often\r\nsynonymous with penury and want.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Inventor's Rewards]\r\n\r\nVery few of the really valuable inventions inure to the benefit of the\r\ninventors,--even to a tithe of the profits that are occasionally\r\nrealized. His necessities often compel him to a forced sale of his patent\r\nright to some capitalist who has the tact to turn other men's wits to his\r\nown advantage; or the _Public_,--which simply means other capitalists of\r\nanother description, who possess little or no inventive genius\r\nthemselves, and just about as much principle as genius--seize upon the\r\ninvention, and often in spite of law, justice, or right, reap the reward\r\njustly due to another.\r\n\r\nThis, however, is a digression for which we beg the reader's pardon; but\r\nwe could not let the occasion pass without rendering this honest tribute\r\nto the public spirited farmer, who had the discernment to perceive its\r\nmerits, and the liberality to aid its introduction, of one of the most\r\nvaluable improvements of this, or any age.\r\n\r\nThe following three letters not only embrace the year 1837, but are\r\nequally good evidence from that period to the present, 1854. As they are\r\nshort, and to the point, we use them all. The very appropriate and just\r\nremarks of Col. Hughes as regards the rights, and what is due to\r\ninventive talent, we most cordially respond to; as must every right\r\nminded and disinterested reader. He refers to Col. Edw. Lloyd of \"Wye\r\nHouse\" as the largest wheat grower in Maryland; we much doubt if he is\r\nnot the largest in the Union. Several years since, he informed us that\r\nhis average crop of wheat was from 33 to 35 thousand bushels; and a year\r\nor two ago we learned that the crop exceeded forty thousand bushels. He\r\nnow, and for many years past has used Hussey's Reaper exclusively. More\r\nsatisfactory and conclusive evidence cannot be given, or desired, than\r\nis afforded in these three letters, of the early use, and long proved\r\nefficiency of the invention.\r\n\r\n    \"Hornewood, E. Shore, Md.,\r\n    \"August 22, '54.\r\n\r\n    \"Dear Sir:--In reply to your enquiry whether I recollect the time,\r\n    and the success of your reaping machine at my father's in 1837, I\r\n    answer that I do perfectly; and also seeing it in operation in\r\n    company with my friend, Mr. J.

H. McCormick in 1831 he did not sell a\r\nsingle machine; nor could he establish by all the evidence adduced\r\nbefore the Board of Extensions, in 1848, that prior to 1840 or 1841 was\r\nhis reaper in any degree an effective or practical machine; for as he\r\nhimself states in the letter to Philip Pusey, Esq., M. P., it was not\r\nuntil very material alterations--all essential it may be said--were\r\nmade, some six or eight years after the date of the patent, could the\r\nmachine be made to work even tolerably well. Indeed, he states, \"I may\r\nsay they were not of much practical value, until the improvements of my\r\nsecond patent in 1845,\" being eleven years after the date of the patent,\r\nand fourteen years after the alleged invention in 1831.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand we have shown by as good and respectable testimony as\r\ncan be had in any cause, that from 1833 to 1854, a period of twenty-one\r\nyears, Hussey's invention was most efficient and satisfactory, _every\r\nyear_; not by cutting a patch of the fraction of an acre, but by\r\nreaping hundreds, nay thousands of acres annually, by the few machines\r\nplaced in the hands of the farmers from 1833 to 1840.\r\n\r\nAs, however, we have given no direct evidence from Delaware, or\r\nVirginia, none from North Carolina, and but one from New York, we annex\r\na few short testimonials from each, that embrace the period from 1838 to\r\n1845; and with a few more of the same respectable character up to 1853,\r\nboth in this country and in England, we will leave the decision of the\r\nquestion to the intelligent reader. We will, however, call the reader's\r\nattention to the concluding paragraph of Maj. J. Jones' letter, from\r\nDelaware--one of the smallest States, but containing as large a\r\nproportion of noble minded, talented men, and as good practical farmers,\r\nas any in the Union.[5]\r\n\r\n      [5] It is reported of one of her sons, that during the struggle\r\n      for Independence, when a Delegate to the Convention from one of the\r\n      largest and most powerful Colonies was ready to quail and almost\r\n      despair of success in the unequal contest, he was encouraged and\r\n      cheered on by a member from little Delaware; and told that when he\r\n      found his Colony likely to be overrun by the enemy, to call on\r\n      Delaware for aid--she would lend a helping hand.\r\n\r\nIt will be perceived that a reaper sold in 1838 to the St. George's and\r\nAppoquinomick Agricultural Society had, after subsequently coming into\r\nthe possession of Col. Vandergrift, and prior to 1845, \"cut about\r\n_seven hundred acres_ of his grain,\" and \"was then in good repair\"!\r\nWe wish it was in our power to state how many times seven hundred acres\r\nthis single machine had reaped since 1838.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: An Important Testimonial from Delaware]\r\n\r\n    \"Wheatland, Del.,\r\n    \"July 21, 1845.\r\n\r\n    \"_Mr. Hussey:_\r\n\r\n    \"Dear Sir:--I have just finished cutting my oats; I finished\r\n    cutting my wheat on the 28th of June, having cut over 160 acres,\r\n    excepting what was cut by a cradle in opening tracks for the\r\n    horses and rounding the corners so that the machine might sweep\r\n    round without loss of time in turning, which it did with ease and\r\n    certainty, cutting more than twenty acres a day on an average. A\r\n    part of the wheat was so heavy as to require three active shockers\r\n    to keep up with the cutting; the whole cost of all necessary\r\n    repairs 31-1/4 cents for the harvest.\r\n\r\n    \"Of the two machines which I purchased of you I used the large\r\n    one, having sold the small one to Richard Millwood, who rents the\r\n    farm of Dr. Noble.

I trust, however, the delay will not materially affect\r\n    the value of my communication. In consequence of the\r\n    recommendation of a gentleman who had used \"Hussey's Reaper\" in\r\n    the harvest of 1846 with much satisfaction, I was induced to make\r\n    a trial of one the present season. It was put in operation under\r\n    the direction and supervision of Mr. Hussey himself, upon a field\r\n    of reclaimed low ground, originally Cypress Swamp, which of course\r\n    could only be cultivated in beds--these beds were six feet wide,\r\n    including the water-furrow between, and were intersected at\r\n    intervals of about fifty yards by drains, known to us as\r\n    _tap-ditches_, which cross the water furrows at right angles,\r\n    and are cut from two to four inches deeper than the furrows\r\n    themselves. I am particular in describing the land, as I had\r\n    always supposed that an insuperable obstacle in the way of the\r\n    regular action of any machine would be found in the irregularity\r\n    of surface into which our land is necessarily thrown by our system\r\n    of culture. The machine surmounted every anticipated difficulty,\r\n    and was eminently successful, both in cutting lengthwise with the\r\n    beds and across them. The wheat was cut in a most thorough manner;\r\n    nothing escaped the cutting surfaces, nor did weeds or any other\r\n    obstruction of the kind hinder the machine from doing its work\r\n    perfectly. During the running of the machine one day in the\r\n    harvest, seventeen acres of wheat were cut by it.[6] This was done\r\n    by using relays of horses, four at each time, the same hands being\r\n    employed, however, and the working time was twelve hours. After a\r\n    heavy rain we were obliged to abandon the use of the machine,\r\n    owing to the fact that the ground became so soft that the \"road\r\n    wheel\" as it is termed, buried in the soil, and would become\r\n    clogged with mud. This difficulty can, I have no doubt, be easily\r\n    overcome by increasing the \"tread\" of this wheel, and making some\r\n    slight alteration in the cog-wheel which gears into it.\r\n\r\n      [6] When Mr. Hussey was with me I informed him that the piece of\r\n      wheat cut by the machine on this occasion equalled twenty acres,\r\n      but I have since discovered that I had been mistaken in my\r\n      calculation of the acre.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A McCormick Failure]\r\n\r\n    \"Some two years since I saw an experiment made upon an adjoining\r\n    estate with McCormick's machine; it cut occasionally well where\r\n    the wheat was free from weeds, but any obstruction from that\r\n    source would immediately choke it, when of course the wheat would\r\n    be overrun without being cut. The experiment proved a failure, and\r\n    the machine was laid aside. The blade in this machine appears to\r\n    me to be too delicate in its cutting surface to succeed, except\r\n    under the most favorable circumstances. Quite a number of\r\n    McCormick's have been in use in this part of the country during\r\n    the last two years, and to my inquiries concerning them I have\r\n    received but one answer and that an unfavorable one. The few of\r\n    Hussey's machines, on the contrary, that have been employed within\r\n    my ken, have in each instance given entire satisfaction. I do not\r\n    hesitate to say that when well managed, with a skilful hand at the\r\n    rake, in dry wheat (I do not recommend it when the straw is wet),\r\n    it will, as compared with _ordinary_ cutting, save per acre\r\n    the _entire expense of reaping_, from the thorough manner in\r\n    which every stalk is cut, thus preventing loss or waste.\r\n\r\n    \"Believing, as I do, that a great desideratum to those who grow\r\n    wheat upon a large scale, is to be found in Mr. Hussey's reaper, I\r\n    cannot but wish that both he and they may _reap_ the benefit\r\n    of its general adoption.\r\n\r\n    \"I am, sir,\r\n\r\n    \"Very respectfully your ob't serv't,\r\n\r\n    \"JOSIAH COLLINS.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"Edenton, N.

We are aware, too, that in introducing a subject of the\r\nkind, we are opening the floodgates of a controversy that is often hard\r\nto close; we have had the strongest evidence of that fact in the\r\ncontroversy that once occurred in this paper between Messrs. McCormick\r\nand Hussey, and yet it is to the relative merits of the reaping machines\r\nof these two gentlemen that we are compelled again to draw the public\r\nattention. Probably not less than fifteen thousand dollars has been spent\r\nin Virginia this summer for reaping machines, and it becomes a subject of\r\ngreat importance to the wheat growing community at least, to ascertain\r\nhow such a sum is annually to be dispensed to the greatest advantage. We\r\nshall express no _opinion_ ourself in the discussion which must\r\nnecessarily follow the introduction of this subject, and we would greatly\r\nprefer that neither of the gentlemen more particularly interested in the\r\nsubject would appear in our columns. We will publish statements of facts\r\nfor either, provided they are made over responsible names, and are short\r\nand permanent. As one of these facts we feel bound to state that we acted\r\nthis year as the agent for McCormick's machine, and we have heard great\r\ncomplaint of the manner in which it was gotten up; but it is but fair\r\nalso to state, that we believe Mr. McCormick himself has been\r\nsuperintending the manufacture of his machine in the State of New York,\r\nand that probably his work has not been as well done as it would have\r\nbeen could he have seen to it in person. The following communication is\r\naltogether in favor of Hussey's machine:\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Hussey's Machine \"Vastly Superior\"]\r\n\r\n\"I have had in operation on my plantation this year both Hussey's and\r\nMcCormick's reapers. Now, as you have asked me to furnish the\r\n_Planter_ with the result of my own experience and opinion as to the\r\ncomparative merit of the two machines, it is now at your service. I have\r\nhad them both in operation (as the weather would permit) for the last\r\nfortnight, and have cut with the two rather upwards of two hundred acres\r\nof wheat. Both machines have been, I think, very fairly tested in all\r\nqualities of grain, from wheat five feet and more in height, both\r\nstanding up, and lodged and tangled, and averaging, as is supposed, from\r\nthirty and forty bushels, down to light, thin wheat, not averaging more\r\nthan four bushels (being some galled hills) and I am _candidly_ and\r\n_decidedly_ of opinion that Hussey's machine is _vastly\r\nsuperior_. I deem it superior, not only in the execution of its work,\r\nbut in the durability of the machine. So well pleased am I with its\r\nperformance that I have ordered another machine of Hussey's for my next\r\nharvest, and also one, and probably two, for my father's plantation. I\r\nconsider this machine invaluable to the grower of wheat, and would\r\nrecommend every farmer who grows even fifty acres of wheat, to purchase\r\none. He may rest assured that he will be pleased with his purchase. I\r\nshall probably be in Richmond shortly.\r\n\r\n\"Yours very respectfully,\r\n\r\n\"T.

The grain was\r\n    not only blown as flat as possible, but was tangled and twisted\r\n    together, and lying in every direction; so much so that it would\r\n    have been impossible to cut a large portion of it with the cradle.\r\n    No one who saw the field believed the machine could possibly\r\n    succeed.\r\n\r\n    \"I take great pleasure in stating that its success was perfect and\r\n    entire. It cut and gathered the grain in the very worst spots\r\n    almost as well as that which was standing; and I was thus enabled\r\n    to mow my crop in about one-half the time the _old fashioned_\r\n    method would have required, thereby effecting a large pecuniary\r\n    gain. It cuts the grass as evenly and as close as the most expert\r\n    mower. I need scarcely say that I am perfectly satisfied with it.\r\n    I subscribe myself yours, etc.,\r\n\r\n    \"AQUILLA TABOT.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"Alexandria, Va.,\r\n    \"12 mo., 11, 1852.\r\n\r\n    \"It gives me much pleasure to state that I have had in use on my\r\n    farm in Montgomery County, Md., for the past two seasons, one of\r\n    'Hussey's Reapers,' and its operation has given me _entire\r\n    satisfaction in every respect_.

It compelled C. H. McCormick or\r\nhis agents to offer a challenge, which was promptly accepted by Hussey;\r\nand before the Cleveland Agricultural Society a tolerably fair trial was\r\nhad of the rival machines, though neither the grain nor ground was then\r\nin a suitable state. For the decision of twelve prominent men and\r\npractical farmers we refer to the annexed English account for the\r\ncomplete triumph of the unmedalled machine.\r\n\r\nIn an interview with an extensive agricultural implement maker of\r\nYorkshire--himself an inventor of many valuable implements, and to no\r\nsmall extent a rival--he spoke of Obed Hussey as a man who conferred\r\nhonor on his own country; as well by his genius and talents, as by his\r\nintegrity of character. This feeling was alike honorable to the gentleman\r\nwho gave it expression, and just to an American citizen.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Mr. Hussey's Distinction]\r\n\r\nObed Hussey is perhaps the only American who ever waved the \"Stars and\r\nStripes\" on the soil of England [placed there, too, at different times,\r\non his machine, by _Englishmen_] or who could do it without a strong\r\nfeeling of envy and jealousy being engendered. Even Englishmen, jealous\r\nas they are known to be, viewed Hussey as a public benefactor, and his\r\nmission as one calculated either directly or indirectly to benefit all\r\nclasses. Yet in his own country, which he has so signally benefited, he\r\nis compelled to supplicate for years, and as yet in vain, for rights,\r\nthat others, with not a tithe of his claim and merit, but with more ample\r\nmeans perhaps, or more influential friends, succeed in obtaining. It is a\r\nreproach to the age and to the Halls of Legislation. When it was supposed\r\nthis great invention was perfected in England, many years ago--though\r\n_not_ successful, as was subsequently proved--the _Nation_ took\r\nthe matter in hand, and Parliament voted a reward to its author.\r\n\r\nAt the great Agricultural Exhibition for \"Bath and the West of England,\"\r\nheld at Plymouth in 1853, the _Plymouth Mail_ states: [\"the interest\r\nand excitement created by the trial of Reaping Machines was very great,\r\nand the crowd of persons assembled to witness their performance was\r\nimmense\"]--that Hussey won the prize for Reaping, by acclamation, over\r\nall competitors--the only other American machine present, McCormick's\r\nincluded; and an eye witness states that three cheers were proposed for\r\nMr. Hussey by Sir Thomas Ackland, the President, and member of\r\nParliament, which was responded to by thousands, and without a dissenting\r\nvoice; that his reaper was crowned with laurel by the Judges, and the\r\n\"Stars and Stripes\" waved in triumph twenty-five feet high over American\r\ningenuity and enterprise on English soil.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Gold medal won by Mr. Hussey with the Reaper at Baltimore\r\nin 1853.\r\n\r\nSilver medal won by Mr. Hussey with the Reaper and his Steam Plough at\r\nNew York in 1857.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A Mowing Machine as Well as a Reaper]\r\n\r\nAt this trial it was again demonstrated to the agriculturists of Great\r\nBritain by Obed Hussey [and not the first time, though he was the first\r\nto do it] that his machine would cut their grass quite as perfectly as\r\ntheir \"corn.\" The _Mail_ goes on to say: \"A mowing machine was so\r\nremote from the expectations and hopes of the Society, that no prize was\r\noffered for one; yet Mr. Hussey was prepared with a mowing machine, which\r\nwas taken to an adjoining field of meadow grass and clover mixed. The\r\npeople followed, but evidently with no expectation of being gratified.\r\nThe machine mower was put in action, and to the admiration of every one,\r\nit cut the grass with an evenness and precision which is truly\r\nsurprising, being more close and even than a scythe. The grass left\r\nbehind the machine was quite evenly spread, and where it was not so, it\r\nlay so light and open that the use of the tending machine was scarcely\r\nnecessary. The admiration of the truly astonishing performance was\r\nuniversal.\r\n\r\n\"The cutting the rye was looked for, but mowing the grass took every one\r\nby surprise. Thus a great desideratum has been achieved; the farmer has\r\nnow only to gear up his horses and take a ride through his meadow, and\r\nhis grass is cut.\"\r\n\r\nAgain, at the Royal Agricultural Society's Exhibition, held at Lincoln,\r\nthe present season, the _Mark Lane Express_ states that Hussey's\r\nmachine won the prize over all competitors; and admits that Bell's\r\nmachine was \"at last fairly beaten.\"\r\n\r\nIs there an _American_ who can read these accounts who does not feel\r\nindebted to the man who, solely by his own perseverance and skill, has\r\nadded lustre to his country's renown in the peaceful walks of life? If\r\nthe same man, as a \"warrior in hostile array,\" had raised the same flag\r\nin triumph on the same soil, how would his countrymen have rewarded him?\r\nDoubtless by a \"vote of thanks by both Houses of Congress,\" together with\r\na sword and gold medal, if not a monument in addition!\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A Peaceful Conquest]\r\n\r\nShould not those be equally honored and rewarded by the Country, who are\r\nengaged in the arts and in agriculture; who devote their energies to add\r\nto the comfort and happiness of their fellow man, as those engaged in\r\nshedding blood, making widows and orphans to mourn for their untimely\r\nbereavement, and who literally for hire, not patriotism, and with the\r\nspirit demons, seek to slay and destroy?\r\n\r\nWe fully believe so; for fame and renown in arms are rarely or never\r\nacquired, except by entailing misery and distress on our fellow beings,\r\nand engendering the worst feelings and passions of our nature.\r\n\r\nBut we hope for the advent of better days; when, if the political sword\r\nis not literally beaten into a plough-share, and the partisan spear\r\nturned into a pruning hook, the inventive genius and talent of our\r\ncountrymen shall be more aided and better rewarded by Government, in its\r\npraiseworthy efforts \"for the diffusion of knowledge among men,\" in all\r\nthat really ennobles the mind, and benefits the whole human family. Such,\r\nat least, is the earnest wish and desire of\r\n\r\nA FARMER AND MECHANIC.\r\n\r\n\r\nHUSSEY'S REAPING AND MOWING MACHINE IN ENGLAND\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: An Unfair Disadvantage]\r\n\r\n\"In presenting the following pages for consideration of the farmers of\r\nthe country, the subscriber has confined himself strictly to matters\r\nselected from English papers, which will speak for itself. As a short\r\nexplanation from me will be looked for, I will merely state that at the\r\ntrial in presence of the Exhibition Jury, Mr. McCormick's machine was\r\noperated by an experienced hand sent from the United States, while mine\r\nwas managed by English laborers of the lower class, who were total\r\nstrangers to it, and had never seen it in operation. The trial was made\r\nin unripe wheat on a rainy day. My machine was very improperly adjusted\r\nfor the work and wrongly put together, in consequence of which the\r\nignorant raker failed to deliver the sheaves, and it stopped as a matter\r\nof course, and was immediately laid aside, after cutting but a few feet.\r\nMy machine was never tried in presence of that Jury by any other hands,\r\nor in any other condition, myself not being in England.\r\n\r\n\"It was on such a trial that the Exhibition medal was disposed of, and\r\nwith what justice the reader can judge by reading the following pages. On\r\nmy arrival in England I took my machine into the field that it might work\r\nits way into public favor as it best could. After being exhibited in\r\nseveral places, its rising fame appeared to produce some effect, as it\r\nwill appear by the following in the _Windsor and Eaton Express_ of\r\nNovember 8, 1851:\r\n\r\n\"Alluding to the astonishing and unexpected performance of my Reaper, it\r\nsays: '_By this unlooked for turn of events, the proprietors of\r\nMcCormick's machine found that their supremacy was no longer undisputed,\r\nand that the necessity was laid upon them to look to their laurels; they\r\ntherefore came boldly forward, and threw down the gauntlet!_'\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Hussey's Side-Delivery Reaper As Used in England. (From An\r\nOld Print)]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: How McCormick Received a Medal]\r\n\r\n\"That farmers who are acquainted with my reaper may understand why it\r\nfailed to perform well in the hands of strangers at the Exhibition trial\r\nwhere McCormick got the medal, it will be necessary for me to say that\r\nwhen the machine was sent from Baltimore it was set to cut high. That\r\nwhen the inexperienced hands undertook to make it cut low, they pitched\r\ndown the cutters by putting on the tongue, not knowing any other way to\r\nlower it. In doing so the hind part of the platform was of course raised\r\nhigh. In this condition the unpracticed raker failed to push the heavy\r\nwet wheat off up an inclined plane; and as a matter of course the machine\r\nchoaked, and for the same reason that a mill will choak when the corn\r\ngoes in faster than the meal comes out. A skillful hand would have\r\nlowered the cut at the axle of the machine, and brought the platform\r\nhorizontal or lowest at the rear, as it should be in cutting wet grain.\r\n\r\n\"The following pages will show the result, the authenticity of which, if\r\ndoubted, will be proved by the production of the originals in my\r\npossession.\r\n\r\n\"OBED HUSSEY.\r\n\r\n\"Baltimore, Md., Jan. 1, 1852.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the Hull [England] Advertiser, September 5, 1851.\r\n\r\n\"At the annual meeting on Mr. Mechi's Farm at Tiptree Heath, a few weeks\r\nago, a brief report of which appeared in the Hull Advertiser at the time,\r\nseveral reaping machines were tested, the result then being that one\r\nmanufactured and invented by Mr. McCormick, of America, was the only one\r\nwhich was considered to have done its work properly. Amongst those tried\r\nwas one invented and manufactured by Mr. O. Hussey, Baltimore, Md. (U.\r\nS.) which, in the opinion of gentlemen then present, did not fully\r\naccomplish the object in view. It should, however, be mentioned, that\r\nwhile Mr. McCormick's machine had on that trial the advantage of the\r\nsuperintendence of persons intimately acquainted with its mechanism, and\r\nwho had been accustomed to the working of the machine for some years, Mr.\r\nHussey's invention was (in the absence of the inventor) in the hands of\r\npersons entirely unacquainted with the proper mode of working it. Since\r\nthen Mr. Hussey himself has come over to England in order to superintend\r\nhis machine, and the result has been that it is now brought out to\r\nreceive a thorough trial of its merits.\r\n\r\n\"The trial of Wednesday, however, was the best. It took place in a field\r\nbelonging to Mr. Coskill, Grovehill Lane, Beverly. There was assembled\r\nduring the day a great number of farmers and gentlemen interested in\r\nagriculture, who witnessed the trial with great interest.\r\n\r\n\"The wheat in this case was very much 'laid;' indeed in many places it\r\nwas almost flat on the ground. It therefore afforded one of the best\r\nopportunities for judging of the capabilities of the machine under\r\ndisadvantageous circumstances that could possibly occur.\r\n\r\n\"On the whole, the conclusion come to was that the reaping was done as\r\nwell by machine as by hand. No one doubted for a moment that it would cut\r\ncorn well where it was standing; but some farmers thought it would not\r\nequal the scythe where the corn was laid. The result, however, showed the\r\ncontrary, and every person acknowledged that it had succeeded admirably.\r\nAfter cutting a large quantity of wheat, the machine was taken into\r\nanother field, and after a slight alteration, set to work to cut clover.\r\nWe understand that on the day before previous to coming to Hull, it had\r\nbeen tried on clover and cut it extremely well.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Winning Its Own Way]\r\n\r\n\"As the machine cut along it was followed closely by groups of farmers\r\nstriving hard to find flaws in its performance. But they could not. On\r\nthe contrary, in those places where the corn was most 'laid,' and where,\r\nconsequently, the greatest difficulty must occur in the cutting, the\r\nmanner in which the reaper did its work elicited their loudest\r\napprobation. 'Why,' said one burly old gentleman by our side, 'a man with\r\na scythe could never cut it like that.' 'It is wonderful,' said another.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the Morning Advertiser, September 12, 1851.\r\n\r\n\"On Monday last, the public trial of Hussey's patent Reaping Machine took\r\nplace with the permission of his Grace, the Duke of Marlborough, on his\r\nGrace's estate of Blenheim, near Woodstock, Oxfordshire, and also, on the\r\nadjoining one of Mr. Southern, one of the most considerable landed\r\nproprietors of the country. A large assemblage of the Agriculturists of\r\nthe highest class attracted by the celebrity which this ingenious and\r\nefficient contrivance has acquired for itself in a course of successful\r\nexperiments performed last week in Yorkshire, were present to witness the\r\ntrial, mostly from Oxfordshire and the adjoining counties, but many from\r\na considerable distance, and all of them concurred in the most ready\r\nacknowledgments of its advantages.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Duke of Marlborough's Test]\r\n\r\n\"The reaping commenced at 11 o'clock in the barley field, the machine\r\nbeing drawn by two fine chestnut horses, lent by his Grace for the\r\npurpose of the experiment, in which he took the deepest interest,\r\nfollowing the reaper in a car, and watching with evident satisfaction,\r\nthe ease and rapidity with which the blades cut down the golden produce\r\nof the field. The crop was by no means one calculated to favor the\r\nexperiment. On the contrary, some of it was down and much laid. It was\r\ncut down, however, with great regularity and speed, and the general\r\nevenness of the stubble was the subject of general remark. As the machine\r\npassed on, hewing its way at a smart pace through the dense mass of\r\nstalks, the crowd of eager observers rushed after it, and many were the\r\ncheers with which it was welcomed. Occasionally, to satisfy the ideas of\r\nthe more fastidious, the level of the cutters was changed, so as to leave\r\na greater or less length of stubble, and it was evident to all that in\r\nthis respect the machine was susceptible of the nicest adjustment. Some\r\ntimes at the end of a turn it was rested to give the farmers an\r\nopportunity of inspecting it, which they seemed never tired of doing, and\r\nthen it was turned round at right angles to cut in the cross direction.\r\nIn the experiments upon barley, it showed itself capable of reaping the\r\nenormous space of fifteen acres, which we believe is from eight to nine\r\ntimes the power of the most vigorous and skillful reaper. Afterwards the\r\nmachine was taken into a large field of clover, which it cut to within\r\ntwo inches of the ground, and with still greater rapidity.\r\n\r\n\"His Grace repeatedly expressed his admiration of the powers of the\r\napparatus, and congratulated some of the agricultural gentlemen present\r\nwith him on the prospects of greater economy and security in harvesting\r\nwhich it afforded them. These opinions were generally entertained upon\r\nthe ground, and yesterday at Bishop's Startford, in Hartfordshire, the\r\nfarmers of that part of the country witnessed a similar experiment,\r\nattended with results precisely similar, and which gave them the same\r\nsatisfaction.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: McCormick's American Reaper]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following testimonial was given by the Duke of Marlborough:\r\n\r\n\"Tuesday, September 9th, 1851.\r\n\r\n\"Having yesterday witnessed the working of the American Reaping Machine,\r\npatented by Mr. Hussey, and being requested to give my opinion upon its\r\nexecution, I state that it performed its work admirably, laying the corn\r\nwhen cut very neatly for tying up, and leaving the stubble very regular.\r\n\r\n\"MARLBOROUGH.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nFollowing upon these various successes, an advertisement from the\r\nproprietors of McCormick's Machine appeared in the public papers, as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n\r\nMR.

An attempt was made to keep back the eager crowd;\r\nbut their curiosity was irrepressible; they flocked in upon the machine\r\nso that the experiment could not be properly performed, nor could the\r\njury duly discharge their duties. P. C. Thompson did his very best; he\r\nwas all but everywhere at once; but what avails a police force,\r\n_one_ strong, against a concourse of Yorkshire yeomanry and clowns?\r\nIt was requisite that he should have recruits, and a body of self-elected\r\n'specials' came to his aid, who succeeded in procuring approach to a\r\nclear course. Mr. Hussey then took his seat anew, and his machine cut\r\ndown a breadth of wheat from end to end of the field. It seemed to us to\r\ndo its work neatly and well. The wheat was cleverly delivered from the\r\nteeth of the reaper, and handed over to the binders by the rake.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nTo William Dray and Company.\r\n\r\n\"Stockton-on-Tees, September 27th, 1851.\r\n\r\n\"Sir--Having been in communication with you relative to the trial of your\r\nReaper against McCormick's, and feeling deeply interested in the\r\nintroduction of the new implement into this district, particularly one of\r\nso much importance as a Reaping Machine, I think it is not probably out\r\nof place in me if I give you the result of my observations during the two\r\ntrials which have taken place. From the fact that McCormick's Machine\r\nobtained the prize at the Great Exhibition (though I do not _pin my\r\nfaith_ upon awards made by Agricultural and other societies) the\r\nletter of Mr. Pusey's, in the _Royal Agricultural Society's\r\nJournal_, the various newspaper reports, etc., etc., it was natural\r\nfor me to be predisposed in favor of McCormick's Machine; indeed Mr. M.\r\nhad a prestige in his favor, which of course operated against the 'Little\r\nHussey.' Previous to starting, at Marton, on Thursday, the gentlemen\r\nrepresenting McCormick's machine expressed themselves desirous of testing\r\nthe machines early in the morning when the dew was on, believing that\r\ntheir machine would cut the grain under such circumstances, and that\r\nyours would not. Well, on Thursday we had a deluge rain, the surface of\r\nthe land was very soft, and the corn very wet. Everybody there was\r\nastonished to see your machine brought up the field at a trot, cutting\r\nits way to the admiration of all present; it not only cut _to_ the\r\nleaning corn, but it cut cross over the corn leaning to the left of the\r\npostillion (I presume I must call him). McCormick's machine then\r\n_attempted_ to start (he made two or three attempts) but the\r\nattendant confessed it was impossible to do so. That there might be no\r\nmistake about it, your representatives proposed that their machines\r\nshould go up again; the jury said 'No! we are satisfied that your machine\r\ncan cut it under the present circumstances,' and so ended Thursday's\r\ntrial.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the Gateshead Observer, October 4.\r\n\r\n\"We left the members and friends of this society, on Friday, the 26th\r\nult. on the Show-ground at Middlesbrough, immersed in rain. The scene now\r\nshifts to the Townhall, where, in a handsome and spacious apartment, we\r\nfind them assembled in the evening, to dinner, to the number of 150, with\r\nthe Earl of Zetland in the chair, and in the vice-chair Mr. John Vaughan,\r\nof the firm of Bolckow & Vaughan, iron-masters and manufacturers. His\r\nlordship was supported by the Rev. W. F. Wharton, of Birmingham, and\r\nMessrs. J. T. Wharton, Henry Pease, G. D. Trotter, Isaac Wilson, George\r\nCoates, J. W. Pease, George Reade, John Pierson, etc.; and the vice-chair\r\nby Messrs. C. Dryden, W. Fallows, R. Chilton, etc. In the body of the\r\nhall were the leading inhabitants of the town and neighborhood; also, Mr.\r\nBurgess and Mr. Samuelson (who had come to the meeting with Mr.\r\nMcCormick's reaping machine), Mr. Hussey, the inventor of the reaper\r\nwhich bears his name, and Mr. Pierce and Mr. Stevens (on the part of\r\nMessrs. Dray & Co., agents for Mr. Hussey).\r\n\r\n\"On the removal of the cloth, the noble Chairman (behind whose seat was\r\ninscribed on the wall in conspicuous characters, 'Success to the\r\nCleveland Agricultural Society--Eighteenth Anniversary') gave the\r\ncustomary loyal toasts, and took occasion to observe that had it not been\r\nfor the Exhibition of Industry, projected by Prince Albert, the 'Reaping\r\nMachine,' from which he anticipated great benefits to agriculture, would\r\nnot have been introduced into this country. (Applause.)\r\n\r\n\"The Earl of Zetland again referred to the reaping machine. Such an aid\r\nto agriculture, his lordship observed, was needed in Cleveland and\r\nelsewhere.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. J. T. Wharton, of Skelton Castle, said he had never witnessed so\r\nmuch enthusiasm in an agricultural district as was displayed in\r\nconnection with the reaping machine. Had the day been fine the number of\r\nspectators present yesterday (Thursday) would have been at least fourfold\r\nwhat it was. Bad as the weather was, not only was there a large muster of\r\nmembers of the society, but 803 persons, many of them from a considerable\r\ndistance, paid sixpence each for admission to the ground. The trial of\r\nthe rival machines was, unfortunately, so short, and conducted under such\r\nadverse circumstances, that it was impossible to pronounce any opinion as\r\nto their relative merits; but what he saw of Hussey's was as satisfactory\r\nas he could expect. (Applause.)\r\n\r\n\"Mr. George Reade, of Hutton Lowcross, said, had it not been for the\r\nboisterous weather, the receipts of the Society at Ormesby and\r\nMiddlesbrough would have been marvelous. As it was, there was a large\r\nassemblage to witness the trial of the American reaping machines, and\r\nthey were regarded with an anxious desire that they might succeed.\r\nIndeed, let any ingenious mechanic--he cared not whether he was English,\r\nScotch, Irish, American or German--come before a jury of the farmers of\r\nCleveland with an implement or machine for the improvement of\r\nAgriculture, and it would be judged with candor, impartiality and\r\nuprightness, and the inventor should go home satisfied that he had\r\nexperienced fair play. (Applause.)\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Isaac Wilson proposed the health of 'The Strangers.' To those\r\ngentlemen the members were greatly indebted for their attendance. Had the\r\nweather permitted, they would all have experienced much pleasure from an\r\ninspection of the celebrated reaping machines in action, and the\r\ningenious draining plough of Mr. Fowler, which did him very much credit.\r\n(The toast was drank with musical honors.)\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Pierce, the representative of Dray & Co., being called upon to\r\nrespond, rose and said, bad as the weather had been, he had been\r\ndelighted with his visit to Middlesbrough. The kindness of the\r\ninhabitants soon made him no stranger. He was not four and twenty hours\r\nin the place before he fraternized with the whole parish. (Laughter.) He\r\nrejoiced that Mr. Hussey's reaping machine was now in the hands of a jury\r\nof Cleveland farmers. It would have a fair, honest, impartial trial; and\r\nwhat more could an Englishman desire. (Applause.) He thanked the company\r\nfor the honor which they had conferred upon their visitors from a\r\ndistance, and wished continued success to their flourishing society.\r\n(Applause.)\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Mr. Hussey's Toast to England]\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Hussey was next called upon, and said that he had for many years\r\nbeen building machines in America. If he had had the least idea of the\r\ninterest which England would take in the reaping of crops by machinery,\r\nit would have been a difficult thing to keep him on the other side of the\r\nAtlantic; and he knew not, now, after the reception which he had met\r\nwith, how he should ever get home again. (Applause and laughter.)\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Steevens, Dray & Co.'s engineer, was also called upon to rise, and\r\nstated that his employers had purchased Mr. Hussey's machine because they\r\nsaw it to be the best, and they would meet every competitor in the three\r\nkingdoms, fearless of the result. (Cheers.)\r\n\r\n\"[It should be stated that Messrs. Fowler, Burgess, Samuelson,[9] etc.,\r\nhad by this time left the hall, and therefore could not be called upon.]\r\n\r\n      [9] McCormick's agents.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Parrington, having read the award, announced that a second trial of\r\nMcCormick's and Hussey's reaping machines would be made, if the weather\r\nwere favorable, on the following morning (Saturday), at 9 o'clock, at Mr.\r\nFawcitt's farm. The jury, appointed by the committee, would give no\r\nopinion on the trial of the previous day (Thursday). That would go for\r\nnothing. They would devote the whole of next day, if necessary, to a\r\nfull, fair, and satisfactory trial of the two machines. (Applause.)\r\n\r\n\"On Saturday morning, the weather was so far favorable that there was no\r\nrain. The trial, therefore, took place. There was a numerous gathering of\r\nland-owners, farmers, laborers, etc., but not so crowded a muster as to\r\nobstruct the experiment.\r\n\r\n\"The foreman of the jury, Mr. Thompson, being unavoidably absent, his\r\nplace was supplied by the Rev. W. F. Wharton, of Birmingham. Messrs.\r\nLister, Outhwaite, (J. and T. P.) Booth, Wetherell, Phillips, and Dobson,\r\nwere also absent. Their places were filled by Mr. William Morley,\r\nDishforth; Mr. Thomas Parrington, Marton; Mr. J. T. Wharton, Shelton\r\nCastle; Mr. Wm. Hill, Staunton; Mr. Joseph Coulson, Sexhow; Mr. Joseph\r\nHarrison, White House; Mr. John Mason Hopper, Marton.\r\n\r\n\"The trial commenced in a level enclosure, adjoining the road from\r\nStockton and Middlesbrough to Ormesby Hall (the residence of Sir Wm.\r\nPennyman, Bart.). The wheat was laid. We have seen a crop in worse\r\ncondition, but not often. The straw was damp and soft. The soil was loamy\r\nand light, and the field free from wet; it was to Mr. Fawcitt's credit\r\nthat he was able to place such a field at the service of the society\r\nunder the circumstances; still, the earth was in a state to clog the\r\nwheels of the reapers. Altogether, the test was a severe one for the\r\ncompetitors. Mr. Samuelson, Mr. Burgess, and Mr. D. C. Mackenzie (the son\r\nof an emigrant from Ivernesse) were in charge of Mr. McCormick's machine.\r\nThe other was in the hands of the inventor himself, Mr. Hussey, and of\r\nMr. Pierce and Mr. Steevens (who represented the agents, Messrs. Dray &\r\nCo.)\r\n\r\n\"The Rev. Mr. Wharton (the jury, competitors, etc., having gathered round\r\nhim on the field, on Saturday morning) announced that after the lapse of\r\nan hour, when the corn would be in such a condition that Mr. Fawcitt, as\r\nhe had just said, would, under ordinary circumstances, reap it himself,\r\nthe trial would commence.\r\n\r\n\"The question was, now, which of the two machines should begin. A 'toss'\r\ngave the chance to Mr. Pierce, and he requested Mr. Burgess to lead off.\r\n\r\n\"McCormick's machine then got into action, taking the crop in the most\r\nfavorable manner--that is, leaning toward the knife. Passing along the\r\nfield (which was from two to three hundred yards in length) it cut down a\r\nbreadth of little more than four feet. The corn being laid, the flier, of\r\ncourse did not come into practical operation; nor was it necessary that\r\nit should do so--the elements having already done its work. The corn was\r\nwell cut--the stubble a little too high.\r\n\r\n\"Another breadth or two having been cut, Hussey's machine followed, and\r\ncut some breadths--somewhat wider than McCormick's, and closer to the\r\nground.\r\n\r\n\"Mackenzie, when we pointed out the shorter stubble of his rival,\r\nadmitted the fact, but said there would be no difficulty--not the\r\nslightest--in bringing Mr. McCormick's knife nearer to the ground. In\r\nAmerica, however, where the straw is comparatively of little or no value,\r\nthe stubble is no object, and there are some advantages in cutting high.\r\n\r\n\"A backer of McCormick's machine (and many bets have been laid on the two\r\nmachines) urged that Hussey's would spoil clover when going among wheat.\r\nThe reply was, that Hussey's knife could be raised or depressed at\r\npleasure.\r\n\r\n\"The next test was cutting the crop across ridge and furrow, so that the\r\ncorn was lying neither to nor from the knife, but sidewise. Both the\r\nmachines cut the corn under these circumstances--Hussey's the cleaner of\r\nthe two.\r\n\r\n\"The jury then required the experiment to be made along the field, with\r\nthe corn lying from the knife.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Hussey consented, and the machine succeeded in cutting the\r\ncorn--leaving a tolerable stubble, but not so short and regular as\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\n\"McCormick's machine was then tried, and failed. As it scoured over the\r\ncorn, making sad havoc, there were loud cries of 'Stop! stop! you're\r\nwasting it!'\r\n\r\n\"Barley was next cut, with much the same result. In this case, Mr. Hussey\r\nadjusted his platform for discharging the corn at the side.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Hussey Wins 6 to 4]\r\n\r\n\"The binders being summoned before the jury, and asked which of the two\r\nmachines they preferred, so far as their particular department was\r\nconcerned, decided, 4 for McCormick's, 6 for Hussey's.\r\n\r\n\"Clover was now to be tried, but at this stage of the proceedings we left\r\nthe field. Clover-cutting, we should state, formed no part of the\r\ncompetition. The agreement merely refers to wheat and barley. McCormick's\r\nmachine is not intended for clover-cutting; but some of the land owners\r\nand farmers were anxious to see clover cut by Hussey's machine. Mr.\r\nThompson, we understand, had requested his proxy to have the experiment\r\nmade. We were told on the ground that the machine had already been tried\r\non clover at Newport, near Middlesbrough, and 'cut it well--if the\r\nweather had been dry it would have cut it beautifully.'\r\n\r\n\"It was pleasant to mark the anxiety and watchfulness of the gentlemen in\r\ncharge of the two machines. Mr. McCormick suffered no loss from his\r\nabsence, he was so admirably represented; and in Messrs. Pierce and\r\nSteevens, Dray & Co. had invaluable agents--on the Thursday in\r\nparticular, when a storm, which ravaged land and sea, could not deter\r\nthem or Mr. Hussey, from practically attesting the reaper's prowess in\r\nthe field. The trial, throughout, was conducted with a fidelity to self\r\nwhich would not throw a point away, and a courtesy to rivals which should\r\never mark honorable competition.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom a Correspondent.\r\n\r\n\"Stockton, Monday, September 29.--A report reached me, after I left the\r\nfarm, that Hussey's machine cut the barley very much better than\r\nMcCormick's. It came to me, however, through parties who might fairly be\r\nsuspected of a bias, and therefore I kept my judgment in suspense until I\r\ncould obtain information on which I could more implicitly rely. This I\r\nhave now got. I have been to the farm again today, and made inquiries of\r\npersons who saw the completion of the trial. McCormick's machine did not\r\ncut the barley so well as Hussey's. It cut it much too high; and as the\r\ncrop was very much laid, the heads only, in many cases were cut off. We\r\nhad Hussey's machine in operation to-day, both on barley and wheat, and\r\nmade better work than on Saturday. Mr. Fawcitt worked it with the\r\ngreatest ease. I think he would soon beat the inventor himself. Even I,\r\ntownsman as I am, made fair work; and in an hour or two's practice, I\r\nwould engage to cut a crop in a manner not to be found fault with. You\r\nmay safely say that any ordinary workman about a farm would be able to\r\nmanage the machine; and when I say this of Hussey's, it is also true of\r\nMcCormick's. The one may be a better machine than the other, but the\r\nmerits of either of them may be brought into practical action by a\r\nlaborer of average intelligence and skill. It is the opinion of farmers\r\nand others with whom I have conversed, that the saving per acre, by the\r\nuse of Hussey's machine, would be about 5s.\r\n\r\n\"At the close of the contest on Saturday, the knives of the two machines\r\nwere placed in the hands of Mr. Robinson, engineer to Mr. Bellerby, of\r\nYork, that he might report thereon, and on the machinery generally, to\r\nthe Jury.\r\n\r\n\"Wednesday, October 1.--The Marquis of Londonderry, and several other\r\ngentlemen, have visited Mr. Fawcitt's farm, to see the machine at work.\r\n\r\n\"The laurels so recently placed upon the brow of Mr. McCormick have been\r\nplucked off--not wholly, but in great part--by his fellow countryman, Mr.\r\nHussey.\r\n\r\n\"We would enlarge upon this theme, but our report has left us little\r\nroom. We would only say, that while the farmers of Cleveland, and of the\r\nIsland generally, are turning their attention to agricultural\r\nimprovements--by reaping machines, draining ploughs, and steam\r\nploughs--we would say to them, in the words of Mr. Hussey to the\r\nCleveland horse-jockey, when his machine was ready for its work, '_Now,\r\nthen, go ahead!_'\"\r\n\r\n\r\nREPORT OF THE JURY\r\n\r\n\"The Jury regret exceedingly the most unfavorable state of the weather on\r\nthe days of trial (a perfect hurricane raging during the whole of the\r\nfirst day), and their consequent inability to make so full and\r\nsatisfactory a trial as they could have wished.\r\n\r\n\"The machines were tested on a crop of wheat, computed at 25 bushels per\r\nacre, very short in the straw, and if possible, more laid than the wheat.\r\n\r\n\"The Jury, taking the different points submitted to their consideration,\r\nin the order as mentioned:\r\n\r\n\"1. Their unanimous opinion, that Mr. Hussey's machine, as exhibited by\r\nMessrs. Wm. Dray & Co., cut the corn in the best manner, especially\r\nacross ridge and furrow, and when the machine was working in the\r\ndirection of the corn laid.\r\n\r\n\"2. By a majority of eleven to one, that Mr. Hussey's machine caused the\r\nleast waste.\r\n\r\n\"3. Taking the breadth of the two machines into consideration, that of\r\nMr. Hussey did most work.\r\n\r\n\"4. That Mr. Hussey's machine leaves the cut corn in the best order for\r\ngathering and binding. This question was submitted to the laborers\r\nemployed on the occasion, and decided by them, as above, by a majority of\r\n6 to 4.\r\n\r\n\"5. Their unanimous opinion that Mr. Hussey's machine is best adapted for\r\nridge and furrow.\r\n\r\n\"6. This question was referred by the Jury to Mr. Robinson, foreman to\r\nMessrs. Bellerby, of York, a practical mechanic of acknowledged ability,\r\nwhose report is appended below.\r\n\r\n\"7. That Mr. Hussey's machine at first cost is less price.\r\n\r\n\"8, 9. The Jury decline to express a decided opinion on these points in\r\nconsequence of the state of the weather.\r\n\r\n\"The trials took place on the farm of Robert Fawcitt, of Ormsby, near\r\nMarlbro'-on-Tees, who in the most liberal and disinterested spirit\r\nallowed his crops to be trodden down and damaged to a very great extent,\r\nespecially on the 25th, when in spite of the storm an immense crowd\r\nassembled to witness the trials.\r\n\r\n\"The Jury cannot conclude their report without expressing the great\r\npleasure they have derived from seeing two machines brought into\r\ncompetition that were able to do such very good work, and also at\r\nwitnessing the friendly, straightforward, and honorable way in which the\r\nexhibitors of the respective machines met on this occasion.\r\n\r\n\"Signed on behalf of the Jury,\r\n\"W.

Brought into life by\r\nthe most eminent men, and supported by royalty; the means taken were such\r\nas no private individual could have accomplished; every exertion was used\r\nto obtain the choicest relics that the earth could produce; almost every\r\ncountry vied in exhibiting the arts and treasures of its products and\r\nmanufactures, and were with one exception considered eminently\r\nsuccessful. The United States of America, however, was thought to be\r\ndeficient, and in one or two cases some rather strong and even coarse\r\nremarks were indulged in. But what are the results? France can boast of\r\nthe richness of its silks and artificial manufactures, and England of its\r\nmachinery; but we find that our own newspapers are filled with admiration\r\nat the inventions of Brother Jonathan. We shall only slightly touch upon\r\nthe sensation produced by the splendid performance of the American yacht,\r\nand the dexterity displayed in the lock-picking, which was previously\r\ndeemed impracticable. But it may be said that these are trifling matters\r\nin a national point of view; still, facts have been elicited by these\r\napparent trifling incidents, for we find that the superior build of the\r\nlittle American yacht involves a principle--it being now admitted that in\r\nnautical matters the Americans are equal, if not superior, to other\r\nnations in their construction of their merchant vessels, and also in the\r\nequipment of their ships of war. On the land they are equally successful;\r\ntheir reaping machines have astonished our agriculturists. We extract\r\nfrom the _Gateshead Observer_, and other local papers, the\r\nsurprising performance of Hussey's and McCormick's machines. Our readers\r\nare aware that there are two rival parties competing their powers on\r\nBritish ground, and without entering into the question as to which of the\r\ntwo performed their work in the best manner, we copy the result of the\r\ntrial. The _Durham Advertiser_ states that the performance took\r\nplace at Middlesbro', and says:\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 19 Out of 20 Favored the Hussey Reaper]\r\n\r\n\"'Few subjects have created a greater sensation in the agricultural world\r\nthan the recent introduction into the country of the reaping machines of\r\nMr. McCormick, and the subsequent appearance, of a rival, of no inferior\r\ndescription, in a similar implement from Mr. Hussey. The interesting\r\ntrial of the two in competition, intended to have taken place on Thursday\r\nlast, was postponed, in consequence of the torrents of rain, until\r\nSaturday, when, under the superintendence of a very efficient jury\r\nempanelled to decide the respective merits of the two implements, the\r\ncontest came off. The compact form of Hussey's implement was in its\r\nfavor, though from the notoriety of McCormick's at Mr. Mechi's farm, the\r\ngeneral preference was at first on his side. McCormick's machine was\r\nfirst tried against the inclination of the corn, and completed its\r\nportion in very good style, leaving the sheaves in a handy manner at the\r\nside of the furrow. Hussey's completed a similar breadth, but deposited\r\nthe sheaves behind, and consequently several binders were required to\r\nfollow the machine to clear the course for cutting the next breadth, an\r\nimperfection, which, however, it was understood could be easily remedied,\r\nand the back deliver replaced by a side one. This breadth was closer cut\r\nthan the one executed by McCormick's reaper. The two were then tried\r\nacross the ridge, where Hussey's implement carried the palm, McCormick's\r\nleaving a very considerable portion of the straw standing behind it; and\r\nthe last trial upon the wheat, in the direction of the lean of the wheat,\r\nHussey's machine did its work very fairly, while McCormick's was obliged\r\nto be stopped in its course, after having taken the heads of the wheat,\r\nbut left the whole of the straw standing. At this time two opinions did\r\nnot exist among the company present--Hussey's being the favorite. The\r\ntrial was then carried to some barley, where Hussey's again succeeded in\r\nobtaining public favor. The more compact form of Hussey's implement, as\r\nwell as the superiority of the clipping action over the cutting action of\r\nMcCormick's, entitle it to a greater share of public favor, and as the\r\nadvantages of a side delivery can be easily applied to it, it will\r\ndoubtless become the more general in use amongst the farmers. We cannot,\r\nhowever, but think that some mechanical process might be substituted for\r\nraking the sheaf from the receiving board, and this with a few other\r\nmechanical improvements, would we think, make Hussey's reaping machine a\r\nperfect, useful and economical agricultural implement. The latter may be\r\nalso advantageously applied to the cutting of clover crops, which is\r\nquite out of the question with the farmer. Another Correspondent on this\r\nsubject says: \"The jury did not on Saturday announce their decision, nor\r\nhave they yet made a report. Nineteen farmers out of twenty who witnessed\r\nthe trial were in favor of Hussey's machine.'\"\r\n\r\n\"The _Gateshead Observer_ remarks: 'The great Cleveland contest\r\nbetween the two American reaping machines, respectively invented by Mr.\r\nMcCormick, of Chicago, and Mr. Hussey, of Baltimore, originally appointed\r\nfor Thursday, the 25th ult., frustrated, for a time by the deluge and\r\nhurricane of that disastrous day, came off on Saturday, the 27th. The\r\ntrial was one of great severity, the crops of wheat and barley were laid,\r\nand the straw damp and soft. The laurels so recently placed upon the brow\r\nof Mr. McCormick have been plucked off--not wholly, but in great part, by\r\nhis fellow countryman, Mr. Hussey. Both the machines proved their ability\r\nto do good work, but Mr. Hussey's attested its superiority; and the\r\nEnglish farmer has now seen, thanks to Prince Albert and the Exhibition\r\nof Works of Industry, that his corn and grasses, hitherto slowly and\r\nlaboriously reaped with the sickle and the scythe, may now be plained off\r\nthe land, in five feet breadth, as rapidly as a horse can trot.'\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A \"Considerable Doubt\"]\r\n\r\n\"'A trial has taken place before the Cleveland Agricultural Society of\r\nthe respective merits of McCormick's and Hussey's American Reaping\r\nMachines, and the report of the jury of practical men, appointed by the\r\nconsent of both parties to decide the question of merit is favorable to\r\nthe latter implement. _This decision throws considerable doubt upon the\r\njustice of the award of a great medal at the exhibition to\r\nMcCormick's._'--_London Times, October 7._\"\r\n\r\nFollowing upon its success at Cleveland, the proprietors were invited to\r\nexhibit the machine at the Barnard Castle Agricultural Society, Lord\r\nHarry Vane, _president_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Barnard Castle, October 8, 1851.\r\n\r\n\"The undersigned President, Vice Presidents, and members of the Barnard\r\nCastle Agricultural Society and others who have witnessed the working of\r\nthe American Reaping Machine, invented by Mr. Hussey, _do certify their\r\nunqualified approval of its operations and entire success_.\r\n\r\n\"Lord Harry Vane, President.\r\nW.

HUSSEY'S REAPING MACHINE.\r\n\r\n\"Great interest was excited in Barnardcastle and its neighborhood on\r\nTuesday last, by the announcement that Mr. Hussey's reaping machine would\r\nbe exhibited at the forthcoming meeting of the Barnardcastle Agricultural\r\nSociety; and that a trial of its powers would be made previous to the\r\nmeeting. Accordingly, on Tuesday last, the machine was brought into\r\noperation in a field of barley, belonging to Mr. George White, of\r\nStainton, near Barnardcastle, which it cut admirably well. The Rev. W. F.\r\nWharton, and other gentlemen in the vicinity, besides a vast number of\r\nfarmers, were present. The Judges on the occasion were H. S. Thompson,\r\nEsq., of Moat Hall (one of the Agricultural Jury of the Great\r\nExhibition); W. Lister, Esq., of Dunsa Bank; and T. Robinson, Esq., of\r\nHutton. Luncheon was provided for a large party in an out-building near\r\nthe scene of the experiments, and it is a fact worthy of notice that\r\nafter dinner Mr. Thompson proposed the health of Mr. Hussey (who was\r\npresent) with great fervour, and spoke of the disadvantages under which\r\nMr. Hussey's Machine had labored when tried against McCormick's for the\r\nGreat Exhibition Medal; Mr. Hussey not being in the country at that time,\r\nand no one being present who understood the adjusting or working of the\r\nimplement. Mr. Thompson said he was now so thoroughly satisfied of its\r\ngreat merits that he would do his best to get a medal awarded to it.\r\nAfter luncheon, the machine was taken to the grounds of Mr. Adamson, and\r\ntried upon a field of oats, which were so laid as to form a very severe\r\ntest to the machine, but it nevertheless was successful there also. The\r\nparty retired greatly pleased with it, and some of the most wary\r\nagriculturists ordered machines upon the ground. On Wednesday morning a\r\nlarge assemblage of agriculturists met on the farm of Mr. F. Atkinson,\r\nWestwood, Startforth, to see the machine cut a field of wheat, and there\r\nagain the experiment yielded all that even its inventor could desire. We\r\nunderstand that a large number of orders were given for machines by the\r\nfarmers present, which is perhaps the very best test of their views in\r\nthe matter. The general impression seemed to be that it would prove of\r\nincalculable value to the agricultural interest.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A Toast to Mr. Hussey]\r\n\r\n\"At about 3 o'clock in the afternoon, a large party sat down to a\r\nsumptuous dinner at the King's Head Inn. Lord Harry Vane presided and the\r\nRev. W. F. Wharton occupied the vice-chair. After dinner the usual loyal\r\ntoasts having been proposed, the vice-chair proposed the health of Mr.\r\nHussey; that gentleman, he said, had contributed to their gratification\r\nand interest in bringing his invention there for trial; the result of\r\nthat trial had exceeded everything they could have previously imagined or\r\nhoped; and therefore he begged they would excuse him for proposing this\r\nhealth so early, as Mr. Hussey and his agents's representative, Mr.\r\nPierce, had to leave by the first train from Darlington, which they had\r\nthen but sufficient time to reach. He proposed the healths of Mr. Hussey\r\nand of the enterprising firm, Messrs. Dray & Co., who had undertaken to\r\nbring that machine into the British market. The toast was drank with\r\nhonors. Mr. Hussey briefly returned thanks.\r\n\r\n\"After some further proceedings, the Vice-Chairman proposed the health of\r\nthe President. Lord Harry Vane responded.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: \"A Worthy, Modest and Unassuming Man\"]\r\n\r\n\"The healths of the Vice-Presidents were proposed. Mr. Mitchell briefly\r\nresponded. Mr. Wharton, in acknowledging the toast, took the opportunity\r\nof again bringing before the meeting the merits of the invention which\r\nhad been the object of that day's attraction. It had been most\r\nunfortunate that when the trial took place for the prize of the great\r\nexhibition, Mr. Hussey had not arrived in this country--nobody knew how\r\nit was managed, whilst McCormick's was properly attended to. Mr. Hussey's\r\nmachine did no work, and Mr. McCormick took the medal. No sooner did Mr.\r\nHussey arrive than he prayed for a further trial, but the Jury could not\r\ngrant it. All difficulty was removed by Mr. McCormick throwing down the\r\ngauntlet. The trial came off in Cleveland--the result was clear and\r\nsatisfactory in favor of Mr. Hussey's machine as decidedly superior. Mr.\r\nThompson, of Moat Hall, one of the Great Exhibition Jury, was also one of\r\nthe Judges in Cleveland, and was so satisfied on the subject that he\r\nleft, determined to urge for a medal for Mr. Hussey. It must be a source\r\nof pleasure to all to find that justice was thus about to be done to a\r\nworthy, modest and unassuming man.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the Darlington and Stockton Times, October 11, 1851.\r\n\r\nTHE REAPING MACHINES AT BARNARDCASTLE.\r\n\r\n\"_To the Editor of the Darlington and Stockton Times:_\r\n\r\n\"Sir--I beg to trouble you with a few particulars of Mr. Hussey's\r\nAmerican Reaping Machine, which I yesterday saw working in a field near\r\nBarnardcastle. I am not a farmer, and of course cannot be thoroughly\r\n_au fait_ at describing an agricultural implement, nor am I\r\nsufficiently versed in mechanics to explain to you the construction of\r\nthe machine in all its details, but of the result I can speak, and that\r\nwith confidence.\r\n\r\n\"Drawn by two horses, a man seated on the near side horse as driver, this\r\nwonderful implement was drawn with perfect ease, at more than the rate of\r\nthree miles an hour, round and round a field, partly in wheat and partly\r\nin barley, cutting a breadth of corn in its progress with a regularity\r\nand evenness that was surprising. No straggling stalks of corn were left,\r\nnone of the slovenly irregular work too often seen where manual labor is\r\nemployed was to be discovered; on the contrary, the field after shearing,\r\nlooked nearly as smooth and even as a kitchen floor or turnpike road. The\r\nfarmer has now no longer occasion to be behind the reapers, dinning in\r\ntheir ears, 'shear low\"--'now do shear low;' for this machine, with a\r\nvery simple adjustment, will cut the corn as low as he can possibly\r\nrequire. A seat on the machine is provided for a man, who, with a large\r\nrake, and with motion resembling the pushing of a punt, removes the corn\r\nfrom the machine as it is cut, and leaves it for the binders to put\r\ntogether in sheafs.\r\n\r\n\"The assistance of two men and two horses are thus all that is required\r\nto draw and to guide this wonderful sickle--and so manned, it will cut\r\nwith the ease and regularity I have described, from perhaps ten to twelve\r\nacres in the working day. Nor as far as I could see, or learn from the\r\nobservation of others, does there appear to be any drawback against its\r\ngeneral adoption. Its price (£21) is not exorbitant--its construction is\r\nnot so complex as to cause a fear of frequent repairs being required; men\r\nof the common run of agricultural laborers are quite competent to go with\r\nit, and the work of drawing it is not distressing to the horses. Neither\r\ndoes the nature of the ground appear to be much an object, for it\r\ntraveled as well over ridge and furrow as it did upon a level.\r\n\r\n\"Nothing could be more unanimous than the approval of which the machine\r\nmet with from all who saw its work, and I was informed that nine machines\r\nwere ordered on the ground. Among the purchasers was the Duke of\r\nCleveland, who, with Lord Harry Vane, was present and examined its\r\nworking and construction minutely. The curiosity excited by the machine\r\nwas great, and an immense number of people visited the ground during the\r\ntwo days. Noblemen and gentlemen, farmers and farm laborers, tradesmen\r\nand mechanics, men and women, flocked to see the implement which from the\r\nother side of the Atlantic has come to effect so important a revolution\r\nin the labor of the harvest field, and all were agreed that Brother\r\nJonathan, though still a young man, had some clever notions in his head,\r\nand that John Bull, in the case of the reaping machine, would not be\r\nabove taking advantage of his intelligence. I am, etc.,\r\n\r\n\"A. B.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the London Daily News.\r\n\r\nHUSSEY'S REAPING MACHINE--TRIAL BEFORE PRINCE ALBERT.\r\n\r\n\"The celebrated battle of the Ganges hardly excited more interest in the\r\nrailway world than the battle of the Reaping machines has lately created\r\nin the agricultural world; nor is the result perhaps very much less\r\nimportant in the latter case than in the former.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Hussey's by Far the Best]\r\n\r\n\"Of the recent inventions for diminishing the cost of production, the\r\nmost remarkable are undoubtedly the Reaping machines of Messrs. Hussey\r\nand McCormick. Perhaps it would be more accurate to call them\r\nimportations than inventions, since both have been in use for a\r\nconsiderable time in America; and amongst the benefits arising from the\r\nExhibition, it is certainly not the least that it has introduced to the\r\nagriculturist of Great Britain implements of the highest practical\r\nutility, which might otherwise have remained forever exclusively in the\r\nhands of their brethren across the Atlantic. It will be remembered that a\r\ntrial of the two rival machines took place last summer, at Mr. Mechi's\r\nmodel farm in Essex, having been directed by the royal commissioners,\r\nwith the view of determining the comparative merits of the two\r\ninstruments, whose patentees were competitors for the forthcoming medal\r\nprizes. At that time Mr. Hussey, the American inventor of the machine\r\ncalled after his name, had not arrived in the country. The weather, too,\r\nwas very unpropitious for the trial, notwithstanding which a very large\r\nnumber of gentlemen were present. The machines were tried upon a field of\r\nwheat, and the result was such as to convince all present of the\r\nsuperiority, in every point of view, of McCormick's machine--a conviction\r\nwhich was subsequently confirmed by the fact of the Exhibition medal\r\nbeing awarded exclusively to the patentee of that machine. The tables,\r\nhowever, were soon to be turned. Mr. Hussey arrived in England; a\r\nchallenge having been given by the agents of Mr. McCormick, it was\r\naccepted by Mr. Hussey, and his English agent, Mr. Dray; and, after a\r\nfair contest before the Cleveland Society, at Middlesbro', near\r\nStockton-on-Tees, on the 25th and 27th of September, a jury of twelve\r\nagriculturists pronounced a verdict in favor of the unmedalled machine.\r\nThey decided that of the two machines, Hussey's had the preponderance of\r\nadvantages--that it cut corn in the best manner, caused the least waste,\r\ndid the most work in a given time, left the cut corn in the best order\r\nfor gathering and binding, was the best adapted for ridge and furrow, was\r\nthe least liable to get out of repair, and was the least price at first\r\ncost. On the two other points submitted to them, namely, which machine\r\nrequired the least amount of horse labor, and which the least amount of\r\nmanual labor, the jury declined to express a decided opinion, in\r\nconsequence of the state of the weather.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Bronze medal won by Mr. Hussey with his Reaper in England\r\nin 1851.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Arrival of the Prince]\r\n\r\n\"There have been many other trials of Hussey's machine in different parts\r\nof the country, and the result has been so far uniformly satisfactory.\r\nAmongst these we have now to mention a very interesting one which took\r\nplace by appointment last Saturday, at Windsor, in the presence of his\r\nRoyal Highness, Prince Albert, originating in a correspondence between\r\nGeneral Wemyss, on behalf of the Prince, and Messrs. Dray & Co. of\r\nSwan-lane, the agents for Mr. Hussey. The spot selected for the trial was\r\nbehind the statue of George III, at the end of the Long Walk, fern--of\r\nwhich there is an abundance in that locality--being the article on which\r\nthe machine had to operate. The Prince having from an early hour in the\r\nmorning been engaged in shooting in the vicinity of the statue, at\r\nhalf-past twelve, resigned his gun, and proceeded on horseback, in\r\ncompany with General Wemyss and Col. Seymour, to the spot appointed for\r\nthe trial of the machine. Dismounting from his horse, his Royal Highness\r\nsaluted briefly and gracefully the assembled company, and especially Mr.\r\nHussey and Mr. Dray. He then asked a few general questions respecting the\r\nhistory of the machine, and observed that as the ground selected was very\r\nuneven (it was in fact remarkably so) the trial would be a good one.\r\nAfter a brief delay, the gear being declared in order, on went the\r\nmachine, drawn by two strong horses, and heedless of ruts and hillocks in\r\nits course, which was very rapid, bringing down every thing it\r\nencountered cleanly and completely, including two or three slices of turf\r\nat least a foot long, and more than an inch thick.\r\n\r\n\"The performances of the machine were not confined to one single course.\r\nA considerable amount of work was performed in the most satisfactory\r\nmanner, Mr. Hussey himself sitting on the box at the side, and throwing\r\naside what was cut down in the manner best adapted for gathering and\r\nbinding. Indeed the work was not confined to the fern; a rabbit which was\r\nnot accustomed to this species of interference was startled and cruelly\r\nlacerated before it had time to escape.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A Royal Order]\r\n\r\n\"At the close of the trial, his Royal Highness gave a practical proof of\r\nhis favorable opinion by ordering two of the machines for himself, one\r\nfor Windsor and the other for Osborne. He then, after expressing his\r\ngratification, rode back to the game-keepers and resumed his gun. After\r\nhe had left, the machine operated well upon some rushes.\r\n\r\n\"It may not be out of place to state here that Mr. Dray's explanation of\r\nthe failure of the Hussey machine at Tiptree Hall (Mr. Mechi's farm) is\r\nthat it was entirely owing to its not being properly managed. On that\r\noccasion, he says, the person in charge of it was simply a porter at the\r\nExhibition, who, not understanding the matter, neglected to clear away\r\nthe wheat as it was cut down, in consequence of which the action of the\r\nmachine was unavoidably and fatally impeded. We witnessed the result at\r\nMr. Mechi's, and certainly there was no such fault on Saturday. The\r\nprogress of the machine was notwithstanding the unevenness of the ground,\r\nrapid and satisfactory; and it was stated as a fact that on a level\r\nground the horses used in drawing may trot, not only without weakening or\r\nimpeding the action of the knives, but even with advantages, as by that\r\nmeans the cutting requires increased precision and force.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A Royal Verdict]\r\n\r\nThe following is Prince Albert's certificate:\r\n\r\n    \"Windsor Castle, Nov. 13, 1851.\r\n\r\n    \"Sir--In answer to your letter addressed to Gen. Wemyss, I have\r\n    received the commands of his Royal Highness, Prince Albert, to say,\r\n    that so far as he could judge of Mr. Hussey's Reaping Machine, from\r\n    its performance in the high fern at Windsor Park, his Royal Highness\r\n    is disposed to form a very favorable opinion of it, and has ordered\r\n    one[10] in consequence for the use of his own farm. His Royal\r\n    Highness can however give no opinion as to the relative merits of\r\n    this machine in comparison with those of others which he has not\r\n    seen at work.\r\n\r\n    \"I have the honor to be, sir, your obedient servant,\r\n\r\n    \"GREY.\"\r\n\r\n      [10] The Prince ordered two Machines, one for Windsor and one for\r\n      Isle of Wight.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom Maidstone & South Eastern Gazette, October 21, 1851.\r\n\r\nWEST KENT AGRICULTURAL SOCIETY'S PLOUGHING MATCH.\r\n\r\nHUSSEY'S AMERICAN REAPER.\r\n\r\n\"A distinguishing feature at this society's meeting on Thursday, the 16th\r\ninst., was an exhibition of the capabilities of the above machine. The\r\nsession of the year of course prevented a display of its powers on\r\nanything in the shape of grain, indeed great difficulty was found in\r\nprocuring even a green crop on which to operate. Undaunted by this fact,\r\nthe inventor was determined to show to the anxious hundreds assembled the\r\nextent of the advantages to be derived from the use of his reaper. At two\r\no'clock the machine was set to work upon a field of clover, short and\r\nlight (as may be supposed), where its performance was effectual as it\r\npossibly could be, exciting a considerable amount of surprise as well as\r\ngratification. It was then taken to a piece of marsh land, where clumps\r\nof stout rushes in many places were growing in thick masses, presenting\r\nthe appearance of stunted grain. The machine passed over this marsh,\r\ncutting the rushes with the same facility as if it had been corn, leaving\r\nthe stubble about four inches long and very regular, giving also a good\r\nrepresentation of the manner in which the sheaves of wheat, etc., are\r\nusually delivered. Both these operations, but especially the latter, were\r\nconsidered severe contests of the capabilities of the machine. Taking all\r\nthe circumstances into consideration, the performance was far beyond all\r\nreasonable expectations. It was a question whether the excellent work of\r\nthe 58 competing ploughs, or the extraordinary novelty of Hussey's\r\nmachine in operation, added most to the gratification of the large\r\nassemblage of the leading agriculturists of Kent.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the Kentish Gazette, November 11, 1851.\r\n\r\n\"In addition to the interest naturally felt by all who live on and by the\r\nsoil in its proper cultivation, there was an unusual degree of attraction\r\nin the fact that a reaping machine by Mr. Hussey (the celebrated American\r\nMachinist) would be tested upon seven acres of mustard adjoining the\r\nploughing field. The reaping was commenced about twelve o'clock, and\r\ncontinued for a considerable period. The crop of mustard was wet, and by\r\nno means calculated to favor the experiment. It was, however, after the\r\nmachine was properly arranged, cut down with great regularity; and at a\r\nspeed equal to four miles an hour it traversed the circuit of the field,\r\nhewing its way through the mustard, quickly followed by a crowd of eager\r\nobservers, whose wondering gaze exhibited at once their astonishment and\r\nadmiration of its working. Occasionally the level of the cutters were\r\naltered, so as to leave a greater or less length of stubble, which\r\nevinced the accurate adjustment to which the machine could be brought.\r\nSome portion of it was taken to pieces, and the whole of the arrangements\r\nshown, which the farmers present displayed an eager anxiety to\r\ninvestigate, and many were the questions proposed, and satisfactorily\r\nanswered by the talented inventor.\r\n\r\n\"We should mention that the undulation of the land does not impede its\r\noperations in the least--as it was well observed by a gentleman present,\r\nthat where a cart could travel there this machine could also go, and\r\ncomplete its design. No previous acquaintance with its principle is\r\nnecessary to be able to guide its operation, as was shown by Mr. Neame,\r\nJr., who mounted the platform and discharged the functions appertaining\r\nto the party who removes the corn from the machine after it is cut, with\r\nthe greatest ease and precision. Indeed the most unqualified approval was\r\ngiven by the gentlemen present, to the applicability of the reaping\r\nmachine to the purposes for which it is designed. We have thus entered\r\ninto minute particulars, because this is the first opportunity we have\r\nhad of witnessing the results of such an experiment, attended as it was\r\nwith every degree of satisfaction. Lord Sondes gave an order for one of\r\nthe machines, and we understand that three or four orders were given in\r\nthe course of the day.\r\n\r\n\"At the dinner which followed, the chairman gave 'Sir John Tylden and the\r\nvisitors.'\r\n\r\n\"Sir John Tylden, as a member as well as a visitor, replied to the toast,\r\nand in a jocular strain animadverted on the suffering of the farmers of\r\nFaversham, who were determined, like a celebrated regiment in the\r\nservice, to 'die hard.' He alluded to the reaping machine of Mr. Hussey,\r\nwhich he characterized in contradistinction to that of Mr. McCormick's\r\nand all others, as the universal reaping machine, of which he spoke in\r\nhighly approving terms, and passed a warm eulogium on its talented\r\ninventor, and the country he represented, which in the space of 80 years\r\nhad risen from a wilderness to her now exalted position, and proud of her\r\nAnglo-Saxon blood.\"",
