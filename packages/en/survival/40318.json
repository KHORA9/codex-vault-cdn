FISK\r\n\r\nAssistant Professor of Dairy Industry (Cheese-Making),\r\nNew York State College of Agriculture\r\nat Cornell University\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNew York\r\nThe Macmillan Company\r\n1918\r\nAll rights reserved\r\n\r\n\r\nCopyright, 1918,\r\nBy the Macmillan Company.\r\n\r\nSet up and electrotyped. Published July, 1918.\r\n\r\nNorwood Press\r\nJ. S. Cushing Co.--Berwick & Smith Co.\r\nNorwood, Mass., U.S.A.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE\r\n\r\n\r\nCertain products we associate with the manufactures of the household, so\r\nfamiliar and of such long standing that we do not think of them as\r\nrequiring investigation or any special support of science. The older\r\nones of us look back on cheese as an ancient home product; yet the\r\nold-fashioned hard strong kind has given place to many named varieties,\r\nsome of them bearing little resemblance to the product of the kitchen\r\nand the buttery. We have analyzed the processes; discovered\r\nmicroorganisms that hinder or help; perfected devices and machines;\r\ndevised tests of many kinds; studied the chemistry; developed markets\r\nfor standardized commodities. Here is one of the old established farm\r\nindustries that within a generation has passed from the housewife and\r\nthe home-made hand press to highly perfected factory processes employing\r\nskilled service and handling milk by the many tons from whole\r\ncommunities of cows. This is an example of the great changes in\r\nagricultural practice. Cheese-making is now a piece of applied science;\r\nmany students in the colleges are studying the subject; no one would\r\nthink of undertaking it in the old way: for these reasons this book is\r\nwritten.\r\n\r\nThis book is intended as a guide in the interpretation of the processes\r\nof making and handling a series of important varieties of cheese. The\r\nkinds here considered are those made commercially in America, or so\r\nwidely met in the trade that some knowledge of them is necessary. The\r\nrelation of cheese to milk and to its production and composition has\r\nbeen presented in so far as required for this purpose. The principles\r\nand practices underlying all cheese-making have been brought together\r\ninto a chapter on curd-making. A chapter on classification then brings\r\ntogether into synoptical form our knowledge of groups of varieties.\r\nThese groups are then discussed separately. The problems of factory\r\nbuilding, factory organization, buying and testing milk, and the proper\r\nmarketing of cheese, are briefly discussed.\r\n\r\nSuch a discussion should be useful to the student, to the beginner in\r\ncheese-making, as a reference book on many varieties in the hands of\r\nmakers who specialize in single varieties, and to the housekeeper or\r\nteacher of domestic science. The material has been brought together from\r\nthe experience of the writers, supplemented by free use of the\r\nliterature in several languages. Standard references to this literature\r\nare added in the text.\r\n\r\nNo introduction to the subject of cheese should fail to mention the work\r\nof J. H. Monrad, who has recently passed away. Mr. Monrad never\r\ncollected his material into a single publication, but his contributions\r\nto cheese-making information, scattered widely in trade literature over\r\na period of thirty years, form an encyclopedia of the subject.\r\n\r\nBulletins of the Agricultural Experiment Stations and United States\r\nDepartment of Agriculture have been quoted extensively, with citation of\r\nthe sources of the material. Personal assistance from Professor W. A.\r\nStocking and other members of the Dairy Department of Cornell\r\nUniversity, and C. F. Doane of the United States Department of\r\nAgriculture, is gladly acknowledged.\r\n\r\nStudents cannot learn out of books to make cheese. They may, however,\r\nbe aided in understanding the problems from such study. To make cheese\r\nsuccessfully they must have intimate personal touch with some person who\r\nknows cheese. Sympathetic relations with such a teacher day by day in\r\nthe cheese-room are essential to success in making cheese which, at its\r\nbest, is one of the most attractive of food-products.\r\n\r\n\r\n  THE AUTHORS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\r\n\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER I\r\n\r\n                                                                PAGES\r\n\r\n  GENERAL STATEMENT ON CHEESE                                     1-4\r\n\r\n  Nature of cheese, 1;

Its solidity depends on the curdling or coagulation of part or all\r\nof the protein and the expulsion of the watery part or whey. The\r\ncoagulum or curd so formed incloses part of the milk-serum (technically\r\nwhey) or watery portion of the milk, part of the salts, part or all of\r\nthe fat, and an aliquot part of the milk-sugar. The loss in manufacture\r\nincludes a small fraction of the protein and fat, the larger proportion\r\nof the water, salts and milk-sugar.\r\n\r\n+1. Nature of cheese.+--Milk of itself is an exceedingly perishable\r\nproduct. Cheese preserves the most important nutrient parts of the milk\r\nin condition for consumption over a much longer period. The duration of\r\nthis period and the ripening and other changes taking place depend very\r\nclosely on the composition of the freshly made cheese. There is an\r\nintimate relation between the water, fat, protein and salt-content of\r\nthe newly made cheese and the ripening processes which produce the\r\nparticular flavors of the product when it is ready for the consumer.\r\nThis relation is essentially biological. A cheese containing 60 to 75\r\nper cent of water, as in \"cottage cheese\" (the sour-milk cheese so\r\nwidely made in the homes), must be eaten or lost in a very few days.\r\nSpoilage is very rapid. In contrast to this, the Italian Parmesan, with\r\n30 to 32 per cent of water, requires two to three years for proper\r\nripening.\r\n\r\nThe cheeses made from soured skim-milk probably represent the most\r\nancient forms of cheese-making. Their origin is lost in antiquity. The\r\nmakers of Roquefort cheese cite passages from Pliny which they think\r\nrefer to an early form of that product. It is certain that cheese in\r\nsome form has been familiar to man throughout historic times. The\r\ntechnical literature of cheese-making is, however, essentially recent.\r\nThe older literature may be cited to follow the historical changes in\r\ndetails of practice.\r\n\r\n+2. Cheese-making as an art+ has been developed to high stages of\r\nperfection in widely separate localities. The best known varieties of\r\ncheese bear the geographical names of the places of their origin. The\r\npractices of making and handling such cheeses have been developed in\r\nintimate relation to climate, local conditions and the habits of the\r\npeople. So close has been this adjustment in some cases, that the\r\nremoval of expert makers of such cheeses to new regions has resulted in\r\ntotal failure to transplant the industry.\r\n\r\n+3. Cheese-making as a science+ has been a comparatively recent\r\ndevelopment. It has been partly a natural outgrowth of the desire of\r\nemigrant peoples to carry with them the arts of their ancestral home,\r\npartly the desire to manufacture at home the good things met in foreign\r\ntravel. Its development has been largely coincident with the development\r\nof the agricultural school and the science of dairy biology. Even now\r\nwe have but a limited knowledge of a few of the 500 or more varieties of\r\ncheese named in the literature. It is desirable to bring together the\r\nknowledge of underlying principles as far as they are known.\r\n\r\nNo technical description of a cheese-handling process can replace\r\nexperience. Descriptions of appearances and textures of curd in terms\r\ndefinite enough to be understood by beginners have been found to be\r\nimpossible. It is possible, however, to lay down principles and\r\nessentials of practice which are common to the industry and form the\r\nfoundation for intelligent work. Cheese-making will be a science only as\r\nwe depart from the mere repetition of a routine or rule-of-thumb\r\npractice and understand the underlying principles.\r\n\r\n+4. Problems in cheese-making.+--Any understanding of these problems\r\ncalls for a working knowledge of the very complex series of factors\r\ninvolved. These include the chemical composition of the milk, the nature\r\nof rennet and character of its action under the conditions met in\r\ncheese-making, the nature of the micro-organisms in milk, and the\r\nmethods of controlling them, their relation to acidity and to the\r\nripening of the cheese. To these scientific demands must be added\r\nacquaintance with the technique of the whole milk industry, from its\r\nproduction and handling on the farm through the multiplicity of details\r\nof factory installation and organization, to those intangible factors\r\nconcerned with the texture, body, odor and taste of the varied products\r\nmade from it. Some of these factors can be adequately described; others\r\nhave thus far been handed on from worker to worker but have baffled\r\nevery effort at standardization or definition.\r\n\r\n+5. History.+--The recorded history of the common varieties of cheese is\r\nonly fragmentary. Practices at one time merely local in origin followed\r\nthe lines of emigration. Records of processes of manufacture were not\r\nkept. The continuance of a particular practice depended on the skill and\r\nmemory of the emigrant, who called his cheese after the place of origin.\r\nOther names of the same kind were applied by the makers for selling\r\npurposes. The widely known names were thus almost all originally\r\ngeographical. Some of them, such as Gorgonzola, are used for cheeses not\r\nnow made at the places whose names they bear. Naturally, this method of\r\ndevelopment has produced national groups of cheeses which have many\r\ncommon characteristics but differ in detail. The English cheeses form a\r\ntypical group of this kind.\r\n\r\nEmigration to America carried English practices across the Atlantic. The\r\nstory of cheese-making in America has been so closely linked with the\r\ndevelopment of the American Cheddar process that the historical aspects\r\nof the industry in this country are considered under that head in\r\nChapter VIII.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\n_THE MILK IN ITS RELATION TO CHEESE_\r\n\r\n\r\nThe opaque whitish liquid, secreted by the mammary glands of female\r\nmammals for the nourishment of their young, is known as milk. The milk\r\nof the cow is the kind commonly used for cheese-making in America.\r\n\r\n+6. Factors affecting the quality.+--The process of cheese-making begins\r\nwith drawing the milk from the udder. The care and treatment the milk\r\nreceives, while being drawn, and its subsequent handling, have a decided\r\ninfluence on its qualities. The process of cheese-making is varied\r\naccording to the qualities of the milk. There are five factors that\r\ninfluence the quality of the milk for cheese-making: (1) its chemical\r\ncomposition; (2) the flavor of feed eaten by the cow; (3) the absorption\r\nof flavors and odors from the atmosphere; (4) the health of the cow; (5)\r\nthe bacteria present. The first factor is dependent on the breed and\r\nindividuality of the cow. The other four factors are almost entirely\r\nwithin the control of man. Of these factors, number five is of the most\r\nimportance, and is the one most frequently neglected.\r\n\r\n+7. Chemical composition.+--The high, low and average composition of\r\nmilk is approximately as follows:\r\n\r\n  TABLE I\r\n\r\n  COMPOSITION OF MILK\r\n\r\n  --------+-------+------+--------+-------+---------+-----\r\n          | WATER | FAT  | CASEIN | SUGAR | ALBUMIN | ASH\r\n          |  PER  | PER  |  PER   |  PER  |   PER   | PER\r\n          | CENT  | CENT |  CENT  | CENT  |   CENT  | CENT\r\n  --------+-------+------+--------+-------+---------+-----\r\n  High    | 88.90 | 5.50 |  3.00  | 5.00  |   .72   | .73\r\n  Low     | 85.05 | 3.00 |  2.10  | 4.60  |   .70   | .70\r\n  Average | 87.47 | 3.80 |  2.50  | 4.80  |   .71   | .72\r\n  --------+-------+------+--------+-------+---------+-----\r\n\r\n+8. Factors causing variation in composition.+--The composition of cow's\r\nmilk varies according to several factors. The composition of the milk of\r\ndifferent breeds differs to such a degree that whole series of factories\r\nare found with lower or higher figures than these averages on account of\r\ndominant presence of particular kinds of cattle.\r\n\r\nThe following table shows the usual effect of breed on fat and total\r\nsolids of milk:\r\n\r\n  TABLE II\r\n\r\n  THE USUAL EFFECT OF BREED OF COWS ON FAT AND TOTAL\r\n  SOLIDS OF MILK\r\n\r\n  ------------------+------------------------\r\n                    |       AVERAGES\r\n  BREED OF COWS     +----------+-------------\r\n                    |   Fat    | Total Solids\r\n                    | Per Cent |   Per Cent\r\n  ------------------+----------+-------------\r\n  Jersey            |   5.62   |    14.74\r\n  Guernsey          |   5.34   |    14.70\r\n  Shorthorn         |   4.17   |    13.41\r\n  Ayrshire          |   3.61   |    12.72\r\n  Holstein-Friesian |   3.30   |    11.89\r\n  ------------------+----------+-------------\r\n\r\nThe figures[1] in Tables I and II are compiled and averaged from a large\r\nnumber of analyses made at different agricultural experiment stations.\r\n\r\nThis variation not only affects the fat, but all constituents of the\r\nmilk. While there is a difference in the composition of the milk from\r\ncows of different breeds, there is almost as wide variation in the\r\ncomposition of the milk from single cows[2] of the same breed. With the\r\nsame cow the stage of lactation causes a wide variation in the\r\ncomposition of the milk.[3] As the period of lactation advances, the\r\nmilk increases in percentage of fat and other solids.\r\n\r\n+9. Milk constituents.+--From the standpoint of the cheese-maker, the\r\nsignificant constituents of milk are water, fat, casein, milk-sugar,\r\nalbumin, ash and enzymes. These will be discussed separately.\r\n\r\n+10. Water.+--The retention of the solids and the elimination of the\r\nwater are among the chief considerations in cheese-making. Water forms\r\n84 to 89 per cent of milk. Cheese-making calls for the reduction of this\r\npercentage to that typical of the particular variety of cheese desired\r\nwith the least possible loss of milk solids. This final percentage\r\nvaries from 30 to 70 per cent with the variety of cheese. The water has\r\ntwo uses in the cheese: (1) It imparts smoothness and mellowness to the\r\nbody of the cheese; (2) it furnishes suitable conditions for the action\r\nof the ripening agents. To some extent the water may supplement or even\r\nreplace fat in its effect on the texture of the cheese. If the cheese is\r\nproperly made, the water present is in such combination as to give no\r\nsuggestion of a wet or \"leaky\" product.\r\n\r\n+11. Fat.+--Fat is present in the milk in the form of suspended small\r\ntransparent globules (as an emulsion). These globules vary in size with\r\nthe breed and individuality of the cow and in color from a very light\r\nyellow to a deep yellow shade as sought in butter. Milk with small fat\r\nglobules is preferred for cheese-making, because these are not so easily\r\nlost in the process. Milk-fat is made up of several different compounds\r\ncalled glycerids,[4] which are formed by the union of an organic acid\r\nwith glycerine as a base.\r\n\r\nFat is important in cheese-making for two reasons: (1) Its influence on\r\nthe yield of cheese; (2) its effect on the quality of the cheese. Many\r\nof the details of cheese-making processes have been developed to prevent\r\nthe loss of fat in manufacture. The yield of cheese is almost directly\r\nin proportion to the amount of fat in the milk; nevertheless, because\r\nthe solids not fat do not increase exactly in proportion to the fat, the\r\ncheese yield is not exactly in proportion to the fat. The fat, however,\r\nis a good index of the cheese-producing power of the milk.\r\n\r\n+12. Casein.+--Cheese-making is possible because of the peculiar\r\nproperties of casein. This is the fundamental substance of cheese-making\r\nbecause it has the capacity to coagulate or curdle under the action of\r\nacid and rennet enzymes. Casein is an extremely complex organic\r\ncompound.[5] Authorities disagree regarding its exact composition, but\r\nit contains varying amounts of carbon, oxygen, nitrogen, hydrogen,\r\nphosphorus and sulfur, and it usually is combined with some form\r\nof lime or calcium phosphate. It belongs to the general class of\r\nnitrogen-containing compounds called proteins. It is present in milk in\r\nthe form of extremely minute gelatinous particles in suspension. Casein\r\nis insoluble in water and dilute acids. The acids, when added, cause a\r\nheavy, white, more or less flocculent precipitate. Rennet (Chapter III)\r\ncauses the casein to coagulate (curdle), forming a jelly-like mass\r\ncalled curd, which is the basis of manufacture in most types of cheese.\r\nIn the formation of this coagulum (curd), the fat is imprisoned and\r\nheld. The casein compounds in the curd hold the moisture and give\r\nfirmness and solidity of body to the cheese. Casein contains the protein\r\nmaterials in which important ripening changes take place. These changes\r\nrender the casein more soluble, and are thought to be the source of\r\ncertain characteristic cheese flavors.\r\n\r\n+13. Milk-sugar.+--Milk-sugar (lactose) is present in solution in the\r\nwatery part of the milk. It forms on the average about 5 per cent of\r\ncow's milk. Since it is in solution, cheese retains the aliquot part of\r\nthe total represented by the water-content of the cheese, plus any part\r\nof the sugar which has entered into combination with the milk solids\r\nduring the souring process. The larger part of the lactose passes off\r\nwith the whey. Lactose[6] is attacked by the lactic-acid bacteria and by\r\nthem is changed to lactic acid. Cheeses in which this souring process\r\ngoes on quickly, soon contain a large enough percentage of acid to check\r\nthe rotting of the cheese by decay organisms. Without this souring, most\r\nvarieties of cheese will begin to spoil quickly. For each variety there\r\nis a proper balance between the souring, which interrupts the growth of\r\nmany kinds of putrefactive bacteria, and the development of the forms\r\nwhich are essential to proper ripening.\r\n\r\n+14. Albumin.+--This is a form of protein which is in solution in the\r\nmilk. Albumin forms about 0.7 per cent of cow's milk. It is not\r\ncoagulated by rennet. Most rennet cheeses, therefore, retain only that\r\nportion of the total albumin held in solution in the water retained, as\r\nin the case of milk-sugar. Albumin is coagulated by heat, forming a film\r\nor membrane upon the surface. There are certain kinds of cheese, such\r\nas Ricotte, made by the recovery of albumin by heating.\r\n\r\n+15. Ash.+--The ash or mineral constituents make up about 0.7 per cent\r\nof cow's milk. This total includes very small amounts of a great many\r\nsubstances. The exact form of some of the substances is still unknown.\r\nOf these salts, the calcium or lime and phosphorus salts are most\r\nimportant in cheese-making. They are partially or completely\r\nprecipitated by pasteurization. After such precipitation rennet fails to\r\nact[7] or acts very slowly; hence pasteurized milk cannot be used for\r\nmaking rennet cheese unless the lost salts are replaced, or the\r\ncondition of the casein is changed by the addition of some substance,\r\nbefore curdling is attempted.\r\n\r\n+16. Enzymes.+--Milk also contains enzymes. These are chemical ferments\r\nsecreted by the udder. They have the power to produce changes in organic\r\ncompounds without themselves undergoing any change. Minute amounts of\r\nseveral enzymes are found in milk as follows: Diastase, galactase,\r\nlipase, catalase, peroxidase and reductase. Just what part they play in\r\ncheese-making is not definitely known.\r\n\r\n+17. The flavor of feeds eaten by the cow.+--Undesirable flavors in the\r\nmilk are due many times to the use of feed with very pronounced flavors.\r\nThe most common of these feeds are onions, garlic, turnips, cabbage,\r\ndecayed ensilage, various weeds and the like. These undesirable flavors\r\nreach the milk because the substances are volatile and are able to pass\r\nthrough the tissues of the animal. While feed containing these flavors\r\nis being digested, these volatile substances are not only present in\r\nthe milk, but in all the tissues of the animal. By the time the process\r\nof digestion is completed, the volatile flavors have largely passed\r\naway. Therefore, if the times of milking and feeding are properly\r\nregulated, a dairy-man may feed considerable quantities of\r\nstrong-flavored products, such as turnip, cabbage and others, without\r\nany appreciable effect on the flavor of the milk. To accomplish this\r\nsuccessfully, the cows should be fed immediately before or immediately\r\nafter milking, preferably after milking. This allows time for the\r\ndigestive process to take place and for the volatile substances to\r\ndisappear. If, however, milking is performed three or four hours after\r\nfeeding, these volatile substances are present in the milk and flavor\r\nit.[8]\r\n\r\nIn the case of those plants which grow wild in the pasture, and to which\r\nthe cows have continued access, it is more difficult to prevent bad\r\nflavor in the milk. The cows may be allowed to graze for a short time\r\nonly, and that immediately after milking, without affecting the flavor\r\nof the milk. This will make it necessary to supplement the pasture with\r\ndry feed, or to have another pasture where these undesirable plants do\r\nnot grow.\r\n\r\nUndesirable flavors are usually noticeable in the milk when the cows are\r\nturned out to pasture for the first time in the spring; and when they\r\nare pastured on rank fall feed, such as second growth clover.\r\n\r\n+18. Absorption of odors.+--Milk, especially when warm, possesses a\r\nremarkable ability to absorb and retain odors from the surrounding\r\natmosphere.[9] For this reason, the milk should be handled only in\r\nplaces free from such odor. Some of the common sources of these\r\nundesirable odors are bad-smelling stables, strong-smelling feeds in the\r\nstable, dirty cows, aërating milk near hog-pens, barn-yards and swill\r\nbarrels. The only way to prevent these undesirable flavors and odors is\r\nnot to expose the milk to them. The safest policy is to remove the\r\nsource of the odor.\r\n\r\n+19. Effect of condition of the cow.+--Any factor which affects the cow\r\nis reflected in the composition and physiological character of the milk.\r\n(1) Colostrum. Milk secreted just before or just after parturition is\r\ndifferent in physical properties and chemical composition from that\r\nsecreted at any other time during the lactation period. This milk is\r\nknown as colostrum. It is considered unfit for human food, either as\r\nmilk or in products manufactured from the milk. Most states[10] consider\r\ncolostrum adulterated milk, and prohibit the sale of the product for\r\nfifteen days preceding and for five days after parturition. (2) Disease.\r\nWhen disease is detected in the cow, the milk should at once be\r\ndiscarded as human food. Some diseases are common both to the cow and to\r\nman, such as tuberculosis, foot-and-mouth disease. If such diseases are\r\npresent in the cow, the milk may act as a carrier to man. Digestive\r\ndisorders of any sort in the cow are frequently accompanied by\r\nundesirable flavors in the milk. These are not thought to be due to the\r\nfeed, but to the abnormal condition of the cow. When the normal\r\ncondition is restored, these undesirable flavors disappear.\r\n\r\n+20. Bacteria in the milk.+--Bacteria are microscopic unicellular\r\nplants, without chlorophyll. Besides bacteria, there are other forms of\r\nthe lower orders of plants found in milk, such as yeasts and molds.\r\nWhile the bacteria are normally the more important, frequently yeasts\r\nand molds produce significant changes in milk and other dairy products.\r\nBacteria are very widely distributed throughout nature. They are so\r\nsmall that they may easily float in the air or on particles of dust.\r\nMany groups of bacteria are so resistant to adverse conditions of growth\r\nthat they may be present in a dormant or spore stage, and, therefore,\r\nnot be easily recognized; when suitable environments for growth are\r\nagain produced, development begins at once. They are found in all\r\nsurface water, in the earth and upon all organic matter. There are a\r\ngreat many different groups of bacteria; some are beneficial, and some\r\nare harmful. As they are so small, it is difficult to differentiate\r\nbetween the beneficial and harmful kinds, except by the results\r\nproduced, or by a careful study in an especially equipped laboratory.\r\nThe bacteria multiply very rapidly. This is brought about by fission;\r\nthat is, the cell-walls are drawn in at one place around the cell, and\r\nwhen the walls unite at the center, the cell is divided. There are then\r\ntwo bacteria. In some cases, division takes place in twenty to thirty\r\nminutes. Like other plants, they are very sensitive to food supply, to\r\ntemperature and to moisture, as conditions of growth. Inasmuch as the\r\nbacteria are plant cells, they must absorb their food from materials in\r\nsolution. They may live on solid substances, but the food elements must\r\nbe rendered soluble before they can be used. Most bacteria prefer a\r\nneutral or slightly acid medium for growth, rather than an alkaline\r\nreaction. Ordinary milk makes a very favorable medium for the growth of\r\nbacteria, because it is an adequate and easily available food supply.\r\n\r\nIn milk, certain groups of bacteria are commonly present, but many\r\nothers which happen to get into it live and multiply rapidly. A\r\nfavorable temperature is very necessary for such organisms to multiply.\r\nThere is a range of temperature, more or less wide, at which each group\r\nof bacteria grows and multiplies with the greatest rapidity. This range\r\nvaries with the different groups, but most of them find temperatures\r\nbetween 75° F. and 95° F. the most favorable for growth. Excessive heat\r\nkills the bacteria. Low temperatures stop growth, but kill few if any\r\nbacteria. Temperatures of 50° F. and lower retard the growth of most\r\nforms of bacteria found commonly in milk. Many forms will slowly\r\ndevelop, however, below 50° and some growth will occur down to the\r\nfreezing point. Milk held at 50° F. or lower will remain in good\r\ncondition long enough to be handled without injury to quality until\r\nreceived in the cheese factory. In the place of seeds, some groups of\r\nbacteria form spores. The spores are exceedingly resistant to\r\nunfavorable conditions of growth, such as heat, cold, drying, food\r\nsupply and even chemical agents. This property makes it difficult to\r\ndestroy such bacteria.\r\n\r\n+21. Groups of bacteria in milk.+--Milk when first drawn usually shows\r\nan amphoteric reaction; that is, it will give the acid and alkaline\r\nreactions with litmus paper. Under normal conditions, milk soon begins\r\nto undergo changes, due to the bacteria. Changes produced in this way\r\nare called \"fermentations\"; the agents causing them, \"ferments.\"\r\nNormally the acid fermentation takes place first, and later other\r\nfermentations or changes begin, which, after a time, so decompose the\r\nmilk that it will not be suitable for cheese-making or human\r\nconsumption.\r\n\r\nThe following grouping of the organisms in milk is based on their\r\neffects on the milk itself[11]:\r\n\r\n    I. Acid-producing types.\r\n   II. Peptonizing types.\r\n  III. Inert types.\r\n   IV. Alkali-producing types.\r\n    V. Butyric fermenting types.\r\n\r\nEach type of bacteria produces more or less specific changes in the\r\nmilk. As a general rule, the predominance of one of these types is an\r\naid in the interpretation of the quality of the product at the time of\r\nanalysis, such as the age, the temperature at which it has been held,\r\nthe conditions under which it was produced and, in some cases, the\r\ngeneral source of the contamination. The reaction due to certain\r\nbacteria is utilized in the manufacture and handling of dairy products;\r\nother groups have deleterious effects. (See Fig. 2.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 2.--Effect of different fermentations of milk: _U_,\r\nCurd pitted with gas holes; _G_ and _O_, gassy curds which float; _K_,\r\nsmooth, solid desirable curd.]\r\n\r\n+22. Acid fermentation of milk.+--By far the most common and important\r\nfermentation taking place in milk is due to the action of the lactic\r\nacid-forming bacteria on the milk-sugar or lactose. The bacteria that\r\nbring about this fermentation may be divided into several groups on the\r\nbasis of their morphology, proteolytic activity, gas production,\r\ntemperature adaptation and production of substances other than lactic\r\nacid. The larger number of organisms producing lactic acid in milk also\r\nproduce other organic acids in greater or less abundance. Inasmuch as\r\nlactic acid is the principal substance produced, they are called lactic\r\nacid organisms. This group contains different kinds of organisms which\r\nmay be subdivided into small groups as follows:\r\n\r\n  (a) _Bacterium lactis-acidi_ group.\r\n  (b) _Bacterium colon-aërogenes_ group.\r\n  (c) Acid peptonizing group.\r\n  (d) _Bacillus bulgaricus_ group.\r\n  (e) Acid cocci or weak acid-producing group.\r\n\r\n+23. Bacterium lactis-acidi group.+--There are many strains or varieties\r\nin this group which are closely related in their activities. They are\r\nuniversally present in milk and are commonly the greatest causal agent\r\nin its souring. They are widely distributed in nature. At a temperature\r\nof 65° F. to 95° F., these bacteria grow and multiply very rapidly; at\r\n70° F. (approximately 20° C.) these forms usually outgrow all others.\r\nThe total amount of acid produced in milk by these organisms varies from\r\n0.6 of one per cent to 1 per cent acid calculated as pure lactic acid.\r\nThese forms coagulate milk to a smooth curd of uniform consistency. In\r\naddition to the lactic acid, there are produced traces of acetic,\r\nsuccinic, formic and proprionic acids, traces of certain alcohols,\r\naldehydes and esters. Substances other than lactic acid are not produced\r\nby organisms of this group to such an extent as to impart undesirable\r\nflavors to the milk. The action of this group on the milk proteins is\r\nvery slight. They produce no visible sign of peptonization. The _B.\r\nlactis-acidi_ group of organisms are essential to the production of the\r\ninitial acidity necessary in most types of cheese. The practical culture\r\nand utilization of them for this purpose under factory conditions are\r\ndiscussed in Chapter IV, entitled \"Lactic Starters.\"\r\n\r\n+24. Colon-aërogenes group.+--This group takes its name from a typical\r\nspecies, _Bacterium coli communis_, which is a normal inhabitant of the\r\nintestines of man and animals, and from _Bacterium coli aerogenes_,\r\nwhich is similar in many respects to _B. coli communis_. The initial\r\npresence of these bacteria in milk is indicative of fecal contamination\r\nor unclean conditions of production. These organisms, however, grow and\r\ndevelop in milk very rapidly at high temperatures of handling. The total\r\nacidity produced by these forms is less than that by the _Bacterium\r\nlactis-acidi_ group. Of the acid produced, less than 30 per cent is\r\nlactic acid; the other acids are formic, acetic, proprionic and\r\nsuccinic. The large percentage of these acids, with comparatively large\r\namounts of certain alcohols, aldehydes and esters, invariably impart\r\nundesirable flavors and odors to the milk. Members of this group\r\nuniformly ferment the lactose with the production of the gases, carbon\r\ndioxide and hydrogen. The milk is coagulated into a lumpy curd,\r\ncontaining gas pockets.\r\n\r\n+25. Acid peptonizing group.+--These are often associated with colon\r\norganisms. The group includes those bacteria which coagulate milk with\r\nan acid curd and subsequently partly digest it. They grow and multiply\r\nrapidly at a temperature between 65° and 98° F. They impart undesirable\r\nflavors and odors to the milk, which appear to be due to the formation\r\nof acids other than lactic acid, and to action on the milk proteins.\r\n\r\n+26. Bacillus bulgaricus group.+--These organisms grow best at a\r\ntemperature of 105° to 115° F. They will develop at lower temperatures,\r\nbut not so rapidly. They survive heating to 135° F. without loss of\r\nvigor, as occurs in Swiss cheese-making. They produce from 1 to 4 per\r\ncent of acid in milk, which is practically all lactic acid. They do not\r\nproduce gas. They impart no undesirable flavors to the milk.\r\n\r\n+27. Acid cocci or weak acid-producers.+--This group of organisms is not\r\nvery well defined. It consists mostly of coccus forms, commonly found\r\nin the air and in the udder. Their presence in the milk may indicate\r\ndirect udder contamination. These are regarded as of little importance,\r\nunless in very large number, and they have been only partially studied.\r\nThey produce little or no lactic acid, and small amounts of acetic,\r\nproprionic, butyric and caproic acids. These forms rarely create enough\r\nacid to coagulate milk.\r\n\r\n+28. Peptonizing organisms.+--This group includes all bacteria which\r\nhave a peptonizing effect on the milk. It includes the acid peptonizing\r\norganisms, although they are of primary importance in the acid type of\r\nbacteria, because the acid-producing power is greater than the\r\npeptonizing power. Some of the specific organisms in this class are\r\n_Bacillus subtilis_, _Bacterium prodigiosus_ and _Bacterium\r\nliquefaciens_. These are commonly found in soil water and in fecal\r\nmaterial. The presence of these organisms denotes contamination from\r\nsuch sources.\r\n\r\n+29. Inert types.+--As the name indicates, these are organisms not known\r\nto have an appreciable effect on milk. The ordinary tests fail to\r\nconnect them with important processes; hence they appear to feed upon,\r\nbut not to affect the milk in any serious way. Milk ordinarily contains\r\nmore or less of these organisms, but no particular significance is\r\nattached to their presence.\r\n\r\n+30. Alkali-producing bacteria.+--This group of organisms has only\r\nrecently been studied in relation to its action on milk. Investigators\r\nstill disagree as to the usual percentage in the normal milk flora.\r\nTheir presence in milk has been considered to be relatively unimportant.\r\n\r\n+31. Butyric fermenting types.+--Organisms causing butyric fermentation\r\nmay be present in the milk, but seldom become active, because they are\r\ncommonly anaërobic and so will not develop in milk kept under ordinary\r\nconditions, and the rapid growth of the lactic acid-forming bacteria\r\nprevents their growth. These organisms act on the milk-fat, decomposing\r\nit. Butyric acid fermentations are more common in old butter and cheese.\r\nIn these, the fermentation causes a rancid flavor.\r\n\r\n+32. Molds and yeasts.+--The cattle feed and the air of the barn always\r\ncontain considerable numbers of yeasts and mold spores. Yeasts have been\r\nfound by Hastings[12] to cause an objectionable fermentation in\r\nWisconsin cheese. No further study of this group as factors in\r\ncheese-handling has been reported. Mold spores, especially those of the\r\nblue or green molds (Penicillum sp.) and the black molds (Mucors), are\r\nalways abundant in milk. These spores are carried into all cheeses made\r\nfrom unpasteurized milk, in numbers sufficient to cover the cheeses\r\nwith mold if they are permitted to grow. Pasteurization[13] kills\r\nmost of them. The border-line series commonly referred to as the\r\nstreptothrix-actinomyces group are also very abundant in all forage and\r\nare carried in large numbers into all milk and its products.\r\n\r\n+33. Bacterial contamination of milk.+--When drawn from the cow, milk is\r\nseldom if ever sterile. Organisms usually work their way from the tip of\r\nthe teat into the udder and multiply there. The fore milk usually\r\ncontains more organisms than does that drawn later. Most of the\r\nbacterial contamination of the milk is due to the handling after it is\r\ndrawn from the cow.\r\n\r\n+34. Germicidal effect of milk.+--Authorities agree that when a\r\nbacterial examination of the milk is made, hour by hour, beginning as\r\nsoon as it is drawn from the cow, there is no increase in the number of\r\norganisms for a period of several hours at first, but an actual\r\nreduction not infrequently takes place. This is called the\r\n\"germicidal\"[14] property of milk. The lower the temperature of the\r\nmilk, the longer and less pronounced is the germicidal action; the\r\nhigher the temperature, the shorter and more pronounced is this action.\r\n\r\nThis is explained as either: (1) a period of selection within which\r\ntypes of bacteria entering by accident and unadapted for growth die off;\r\nor (2) an actual weak antiseptic power in the milk-serum itself; or (3)\r\nthe forming of clusters by the bacteria and so reducing the count.\r\n\r\nIn working on a small scale or on an experimental basis, this property\r\nat times introduces a factor of difficulty or error which is not to be\r\nlost sight of in the selection of the milk for such purposes.\r\n\r\n+35. Sources and control of bacteria in milk.+--Most of the bacterial\r\ninfection of milk is due to lack of care in handling. Some of the common\r\nsources[15] of contamination are: the air in the stable; the cow's body;\r\nthe milker; the utensils; the method of handling the milk after it is\r\ndrawn from the cow; unclean cheese factory conditions.\r\n\r\nSince bacteria cause various kinds of fermentation, not only in the\r\nmilk but in the products manufactured from it, the question of their\r\ncontrol is of prime importance. There are two ways in which the\r\nbacterial growth in milk used for cheese-making may be controlled: (1)\r\nprevention of infection; (2) the retardation of their development when\r\npresent. The former is accomplished by strict cleanliness, the latter by\r\nadequate cooling.\r\n\r\n+36. The cow.+--The body of the cow may be a source of bacterial\r\ncontamination. Bacteria adhere to the hair of the animal, and to the\r\nscales of the skin, and during the process of milking these are very\r\nliable to fall into the milk. To prevent this, the cow should be curried\r\nto remove all loose material and hair. Just before milking, the udder\r\nand flank should be wiped with a damp cloth; this removes some of the\r\nmaterial, and causes the remainder to adhere to the cow.\r\n\r\n+37. Stable air.+--If the air of the stable is not clean, it will be a\r\nsource of contamination. Particles of dust floating in the air carry\r\nmore or less bacteria, and these fall into the milk during the process\r\nof milking. To keep the stable air free from dust at milking time, all\r\noperations which stir up dust, such as feeding, brushing the cows,\r\ncleaning the floor, should be practiced after milking or long enough\r\nbefore so that the dust will have settled. It is a good plan to close\r\nthe doors and to sprinkle the floor just before milking.\r\n\r\n+38. The milker+ himself may be a source of contamination. He should be\r\nclean and wear clean clothing. The hands should not be wet with milk\r\nduring milking.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 3.--Types of small-top milk pails.]\r\n\r\n+39. Utensils.+--The utensils are an important source of bacterial\r\ncontamination. The bacteria lodge in the seams and corners unless these\r\nare well-flushed with solder. From these seams they are not easily\r\nremoved. When fresh warm milk is placed into such utensils, the bacteria\r\nbegin to grow and multiply. All utensils with which milk comes in\r\ncontact should first be rinsed with cold water and then thoroughly\r\nwashed and finally scalded with boiling water, and drained or blown\r\nabsolutely dry. They should then be placed in an atmosphere free from\r\ndust until wanted for use again. If an aërator is used, this should be\r\noperated in pure air, free from odors and dust. One of the greatest\r\nsources of bacterial contamination of cheese milk is the use of the\r\nmilk-cans to return whey to the farms for pig feed. Frequently, sour\r\nwhey is left in the cans until ready to feed. These cans are then not\r\nproperly washed and scalded. The practice of pasteurizing the whey at\r\nthe cheese factory is a great help in preventing this source of\r\ninfection and the spreading of disease.\r\n\r\nThe use of a small-top milk pail[16] is to be especially recommended in\r\npreventing bacterial contamination. Because of the small opening,\r\nbacteria cannot easily fall into the milk in as large numbers as when\r\nthe whole top of the pail is open. (See Fig. 3.)\r\n\r\nIf a milking machine[17] is used, great care must be exercised to see\r\nthat all parts that come in contact with the milk are cleaned after each\r\nmilking, and then put in a clean place until ready to use again.\r\n\r\n+40. The factory.+--Another source of contamination is the cheese\r\nfactory itself. The cheese-maker should keep his factory in the cleanest\r\ncondition possible, not only because of the effect on the milk itself,\r\nbut as a stimulus for the producers to follow his example. All doors and\r\nwindows in the factory should be screened to keep out flies.\r\n\r\n+41. The control of bacteria.+--If, in spite of preventive measures,\r\nbacteria get into the milk, their growth can be retarded by controlling\r\nthe temperature. If the temperature of the milk, as soon as drawn, can\r\nbe reduced below that at which the bacteria grow and multiply rapidly,\r\nit will retard their development. In general, all milk should be cooled\r\nto 50° F. or below. In cooling the milk, it should not be exposed to\r\ndust or odors. One of the best methods of cooling is to set the can\r\ncontaining the milk into a tub of cold running water, and then stir. If\r\nrunning water is not available, cold well-water[18] may be used, but the\r\nwater should be changed several times. If the milk is not stirred during\r\nthe cooling process, it will not cool so rapidly, because the layer of\r\nmilk next the can will become cold and act as an insulator to the\r\nremainder in the center of the can.\r\n\r\nOne way to destroy many of the bacteria in milk is by pasteurization.\r\nThis consists in heating the milk to such a degree that the bacteria are\r\nkilled, and then quickly cooling it. After pasteurization, the milk is\r\nso changed that some kinds of cheese cannot be made successfully.\r\n\r\n+42. Fermentation test.+--When a cheese-maker is having trouble with gas\r\nin his cheese, or bad flavors, he can generally locate the source of\r\ndifficulty. This can be done by making a small amount of cheese from\r\neach patron's milk, called a fermentation test.[19] Pint or quart fruit\r\njars or milk bottles make suitable containers. They should be thoroughly\r\nwashed and scalded, to be sure they are clean and sterile, and then\r\ncovered to prevent contamination. As the milk is delivered to the\r\nfactory, a sample is taken of each patron's milk. The best way to secure\r\nthe sample is to dip the sterile jar in the can of milk as delivered and\r\nfill two-thirds full of milk.\r\n\r\nThe jars are then set in water at 110° F. to bring the temperature of\r\nthe milk to 98° F. The jar should be kept covered. A sink or wash-tub\r\nmakes a convenient place in which to keep the jars. When the temperature\r\nof the milk is 98° F., ten drops of rennet extract or pepsin is added to\r\neach jar. A uniform temperature of 98° F. should be maintained in the\r\njars. This will necessitate the addition of warm water occasionally to\r\nthe water surrounding the jars. When the milk is coagulated, the curd is\r\nbroken up with a sterile knife. Precaution should be taken to sterilize\r\nthe knife after using it in one jar before putting it into another. The\r\nbest way to do this is to hold the knife for a minute in a pail of\r\nboiling water, after taking it out of each jar. The same precaution\r\nshould be observed with the thermometer. Unless care is taken,\r\ncontamination is liable to be carried from one jar to the other. After\r\ncutting, the whey is poured off. The temperature should be kept at 98°\r\nF. so that the organisms will have a suitable temperature for growth.\r\nThe whey should be poured from the jars occasionally, usually about\r\nevery half hour.\r\n\r\nAs the fermentation takes place, different odors will be noticed in\r\ndifferent jars. In ten to twelve hours the jar should be finally\r\nexamined for odors and the curd taken out and cut to examine it for gas\r\npockets. By this means, bad flavors and gas in the cheese can be traced\r\nto their sources.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 4.--A gang sediment tester, one tester removed.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 5.--A single sediment tester.]\r\n\r\n+43. The sediment test.+--The presence of solid material or dirt in the\r\nmilk is always accompanied by bacterial contamination. By means of the\r\nsediment test, the amount of solid material can be determined. The test\r\nconsists of filtering the milk through a layer of cotton; the foreign\r\nmaterial is left on the cotton filter. Various devices for filtering the\r\nmilk have been manufactured. (Figs. 4 and 5.) In order to be able to\r\ncompare the filters from the different dairy-men's milk, the same amount\r\nof each patron's milk is filtered, usually about a pint. These tests are\r\nusually made once or twice a month at the factory and the filters placed\r\non a card where the dairy-men can see them. Much improvement in the\r\nquality of the milk has been accomplished by the use of the sediment\r\ntest. The purpose of this test may be and often is defeated by the use\r\nof efficient strainers. Milk produced in an unclean way may be rendered\r\nnearly free from sediment if carefully strained. It must be remembered\r\nthat the strainer takes out only the undissolved substances and that\r\nbacteria and soluble materials which constitute a very large part of the\r\nfilth pass through with the milk.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\n_COAGULATING MATERIALS_\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the present time, two substances are used to coagulate milk for\r\ncheese-making,--rennet extract and commercial pepsin.[20] Many\r\nsubstances will coagulate milk, such as acids and other chemicals.\r\nEnzymes in certain plants will also coagulate it.\r\n\r\nThe curing or ripening of the cheese seems to depend on the physical and\r\nchemical properties of the curd, on the activity of certain organisms\r\nand on enzymes produced by them or in the milk. Rennet extract and\r\npepsin are the only known substances which will produce curd of such\r\ncharacter as will permit the desired ripening changes to take place.\r\nUntil recently, rennet extract was principally used to coagulate the\r\nmilk, but because of the scarcity, pepsin is now being substituted.\r\n\r\n+44. Ferments.+--Many of the common changes taking place in milk are due\r\nto fermentations. The souring of milk is one of the most familiar cases\r\nof fermentation. The important change taking place is the formation of\r\nlactic acid from the milk-sugar. The change is brought about by certain\r\nliving organisms, namely, the lactic acid-forming bacteria. Another\r\nfamiliar case of fermentation is the coagulation of milk by rennet\r\nextract or pepsin. In this case, the change is produced by a chemical\r\nsubstance, not a living organism. Fermentation may be defined as a\r\nchemical change of an organic compound through the action of living\r\norganisms or of chemical agents.\r\n\r\nThere are two general classes of ferments: (1) living organisms, or\r\norganized ferments; (2) chemical, or unorganized ferments. Organized\r\nferments are living microorganisms, capable, as a result of their\r\ngrowth, of causing the changes. Unorganized ferments are chemical\r\nsubstances or ferments without life, capable of causing marked changes\r\nin many complex organic compounds, while the enzymes themselves undergo\r\nlittle or no change. These unorganized ferments are such as rennin,\r\npepsin, trypsin, ptyalin. The rennet and pepsin must, therefore, be very\r\nthoroughly mixed into the milk to insure complete and uniform results,\r\nbecause they act by contact, and theoretically, if they could be\r\nrecovered, might be used over and over again. Practically, the amount\r\nused is so small a percentage that recovery would be impractical even if\r\npossible.\r\n\r\n+45. Nature of rennet.+--Two enzymes or ferments are found in rennet\r\nextract, rennin and pepsin. They are prepared from the secreting areas\r\nof living membranes of the stomachs of mammalian young. For\r\nrennet-making, these stomachs are most valuable if taken before the\r\nyoung have received any other feed than milk. Rennin at this stage\r\nappears to predominate over pepsin which is already secreted to some\r\nextent. With the inclusion of other feed, the secretion of pepsin comes\r\nto predominate. Rennin has never been separated entirely from pepsin.\r\nBoth of these enzymes are secreted by digestive glands in the same area,\r\nperhaps even by the same glands. They are so closely related that many\r\nworkers have regarded them as identical. In practical work the\r\neffectiveness of rennet preparations has been greatest when stomachs\r\nwhich have digested feed other than milk are excluded. The differences,\r\ntherefore, however difficult to define, appear to be important in the\r\ncommercial preparation of rennet.\r\n\r\nIt was the practice until a few years ago for each cheese-maker to\r\nprepare his own rennet extract. Each patron was supposed to supply so\r\nmany rennets. Now commercial rennet extract and pepsin are on the\r\nmarket; however, some Swiss cheese-makers prefer to make their own\r\nrennet extract. For sheep's and goat's milk cheese, some makers hold\r\nthat rennet made from kid or lamb stomachs is best for handling the milk\r\nof the respective species. The objection to the cheese-maker preparing\r\nhis own rennet extract is that it varies in strength from batch to batch\r\nand is liable to spoil quickly. Taints and bad odors and flavors develop\r\nin it and so taint the cheese.\r\n\r\n+46. Preparation of rennet extract.+--This extract may be manufactured\r\ncommercially from digestive stomachs of calves, pigs or sheep. An animal\r\nis given a full meal just before slaughtering; this stimulates a large\r\nflow of the digestive juices, containing the desired enzymes.\r\n\r\nThe stomach is taken from the animal, cleaned, commonly inflated and\r\ndried. It may be held in the dry condition until needed for use. Such\r\nstomachs are usually spoken of as \"rennets\" in the trade. Such old\r\nrennets may be seen to-day hanging from the rafters of some of the older\r\ncheese factories. When wanted for use, rennets are placed in oak barrels\r\nand covered with water. Before placing them in the barrel, they are cut\r\nopen so that the water may have easy access. Salt is usually added to\r\nthe water at the rate of 3 to 5 per cent. They are stirred and pounded\r\nin this solution from five to seven days. At the end of this time, they\r\nare wrung through a clothes-wringer to remove the liquid. The rennets\r\nare put back into a fresh solution of salt and water, the object being\r\nto obtain all the digestive juices possible. They are usually soaked\r\nfrom four to six weeks. At the end of this time, most of the digestive\r\njuices will have been removed. The liquid portion is passed through a\r\nfilter made of straw, charcoal and sand. When clean, an excess of salt\r\nis added to preserve it.\r\n\r\nSuch extracts cannot be sterilized by heat because the necessary\r\ntemperature would destroy the enzyme. Effective disinfectants cannot be\r\nused in food products. The extract, therefore, should be kept cool to\r\nretard bacterial growth. The extract is kept in wooden barrels, stone\r\njugs or yellow glass bottles to protect it from light, which is able to\r\ndestroy its activity. Rennet extract should be clear, with a clean salty\r\ntaste and a distinct rennet flavor. There should be no cloudy appearance\r\nand no muddy sediment in properly preserved rennet. Rennet extract is on\r\nthe market in the form of a liquid and a powder, the former being much\r\nmore common. The commercial forms of rennet have the advantage in the\r\nskill used in their preparation and standardization. The combined\r\nproduct from large numbers of stomachs may not be as effective a\r\npreparation as the most skillfully produced sample from the very\r\nchoicest single stomach, but it gives a uniformity of result which\r\nimproves the average product greatly.\r\n\r\n+47. Pepsin.+--Pepsin is on the market in several commercial forms, as a\r\nliquid, scale pepsin and in a granular form known as spongy pepsin. Some\r\ncommercial concerns put out a preparation which is a mixture of rennet\r\nextract and commercial pepsin.\r\n\r\n+48. Chemistry of curdling.+--The chemistry of casein[21] and of curd\r\nformation under the influence of acid and rennet extract and pepsin has\r\nbeen the subject of many years' research. While many points remain\r\nunsettled, the general considerations together with a large mass of\r\naccepted facts may be presented and some of the unsolved problems\r\npointed out as left for future researches.\r\n\r\nCasein is a white amorphous powder, practically insoluble in water. It\r\nis an acid and as such readily dissolves in solutions of the hydroxides\r\nor the carbonates of alkalies and alkaline earths by forming soluble\r\nsalts.\r\n\r\nPure casein salt solutions and fresh milk do not coagulate on boiling,\r\nbut in the presence of free acid coagulation may take place below the\r\nboiling temperature. The coagulum formed in the case of milk includes\r\nfat and calcium phosphate. The slight pellicle which coats over milk\r\nwhen it is warmed is of the same composition.\r\n\r\n+49. Use of acid.+--A commonly accepted explanation of the precipitation\r\nof casein by acids is that the casein is held in solution by chemical\r\nunion with a base (lime in the case of milk); that added acid removes\r\nthe base, allowing the insoluble casein to precipitate; and that excess\r\nof acid unites with casein, forming a compound which is more or less\r\nreadily soluble.\r\n\r\n+50. Robertson's theory.+--According to Robertson's conception, in a\r\nsoluble solution of a protein or its salt, the molecules of the protein\r\nunite with each other to a certain extent, in this way forming polymers.\r\nThe reaction is reversible, and the point of equilibrium between the\r\ncompound and its polymeric modification varies under the influence of\r\nwhatever condition affects the concentration of the protein ions.\r\nAddition of water, or of acid, alkali or salt, or the application of\r\nheat has such an effect, and consequently alters the relative number of\r\nheavier molecule-complexes. Robertson's experiments give evidence that\r\none of the effects of increase of temperature on a solution of casein is\r\na shifting of the equilibrium in the direction of the higher complexes.\r\nHe explains coagulation as being a result of these molecular aggregates\r\nbecoming so large as to assume the properties of matter in mass and to\r\nbecome practically an unstable suspension and then a precipitate. The\r\nacid curd then is casein or some combination of casein with the\r\nprecipitant acid.\r\n\r\n+51. Rennet curd.+--Rennet extract and pepsin coagulation differs from\r\ncoagulation by acids, and cannot be looked on as a simple removal of the\r\nbase from a caseinate. The presence of soluble calcium salts (or other\r\nalkaline earth salts) seems to be essential, and the precipitate formed\r\nis not casein or a casein salt, but a salt of a slightly different\r\nnucleoalbumin called \"paracasein.\" Many writers, following Halliburton,\r\ncall this modification produced by rennin the \"casein\" and that from\r\nwhich it is derived, \"caseinogen.\" Foster and a few others have used the\r\nterm \"tyrein\" for the rennet clot.\r\n\r\nA number of investigations have been made on the conditions essential or\r\nfavorable to formation of the coagulum, especially with regard to the\r\neffects of the degree of acidity and of conditions affecting the amount\r\nof calcium present, either as free soluble salt or bound to the casein.\r\nSoluble salts of calcium, barium and strontium favor or hasten\r\ncoagulation, while salts of ammonium, sodium and potassium retard or\r\nprevent coagulation.\r\n\r\nThe bulk of the coagulum from milk is a calcium paracaseinate, but it\r\ncarries down with it calcium phosphate and fat, both of which bodies\r\nhave been helped to remain in their state of suspension in milk by the\r\npresence of the casein salt. Lindet (1912) has concluded that about\r\none-half of the phosphorus contained in the rennet curd is in the form\r\nof phosphate of lime (probably tricalcic), the other half being\r\norganically combined phosphoric acid.\r\n\r\n+52. Hammarsten's theory.+--According to Hammarsten (1877, 1896), whose\r\nview has been commonly held, the distinctive effect of the ferment is\r\nnot precipitation but the transformation of casein into paracasein. This\r\nis evidenced by the fact that if rennet be allowed to act on solutions\r\nfree from lime salts no precipitate occurs; but there is an invisible\r\nalteration of the casein, for now, even if the ferment be destroyed by\r\nboiling the solution, addition of lime salts will cause immediate\r\ncoagulation. (See also Spiro, 1906.) Hence the process of rennet\r\ncoagulation is a two-phase process; the first phase is the\r\ntransformation of casein by rennin, the second is the visible\r\ncoagulation caused by lime salts.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, if the purest casein and the purest rennin were used,\r\nHammarsten always found after coagulation that the filtrate contained\r\nvery small amounts of a protein. This protein he designated as the \"whey\r\nprotein.\"\r\n\r\nIn accordance with these observations, Hammarsten (1911) explains the\r\nrennin action \"as a cleavage process, in which the chief mass of the\r\ncasein, sometimes more than 90 per cent, is split off as paracasein, a\r\nbody closely related to casein, and in the presence of sufficient\r\namounts of lime salts the paracasein-lime precipitates out while the\r\nproteose-like substance (whey-protein) remains in solution.\"\r\n\r\nBy continued action of rennin on paracasein, a further transformation\r\nhas been found in several cases (Petry, 1906; Van Herwerden, 1907; Van\r\nDam, 1909), but perhaps due to a contamination of the rennin with\r\npepsin, or to the identity of these two enzymes. The action which forms\r\nparacasein and whey-protein takes place in a short time (Hammarsten,\r\n1896; Schmidt-Nielson, 1906). The composition and solubilities of\r\nparacasein have received considerable attention. (See Loevenhart, 1904;\r\nKikkoji, 1909; Van Slyke and Bosworth, 1912.) It is more readily\r\ndigested by pepsin-hydrochloric acid than is casein (Hosl, 1910).\r\n\r\n+53. Duclaux theory.+--Duclaux (1884) and Loevenhart (1904) and others\r\ndo not accept Hammarsten's theory; but to most workers it seems\r\nprobable, at least, that the action of the rennin is to cause a cleavage\r\nof casein with formation of paracasein. However, the chemical and\r\nphysical differences observed between casein and paracasein appear to be\r\nso slight that Loevenhart and some others think that they are only\r\nphysical, perhaps differences in the size of the colloid or solution\r\naggregates. Loevenhart conceives of a large part of the work of the\r\nrennet (or of the acid, in acid and heat coagulation) as being a freeing\r\nof the calcium to make it available for precipitation. Some think that\r\nthe aggregates of paracasein are larger than those of casein, but there\r\nis more evidence of their being smaller, which idea corresponds with the\r\nfindings of Bosworth, though he looks on the change as a true cleavage.\r\n\r\n+54. Bang's theory.+--Another description of the precipitation is given\r\nby Bang (1911), who studied the progress of the coagulation process by\r\nmeans of interruptions at definite intervals. His observations confirm\r\nthe idea that rennin causes the formation of paracasein, and that the\r\ncalcium salt serves only for the precipitation of the paracasein; the\r\nrennin has to do also with the mobilizing of lime salts. According to\r\nBang, before coagulation occurs, paracaseins with constantly greater\r\naffinity for calcium phosphate are produced. These take up increasing\r\namounts of calcium phosphate, until finally the combination formed can\r\nno longer remain in solution.\r\n\r\n+55. Bosworth's theory.+--By a very recent work of L. L. Van Slyke and\r\nA. W. Bosworth (Van Slyke and Bosworth, 1912, 1913; and Bosworth and Van\r\nSlyke, 1913), in which ash-free casein and paracasein were compared as\r\nto their elementary composition, and as to the salts they form with\r\nbases, and the properties of these salts, it is indicated that the two\r\ncompounds are alike in percentage composition and in combining\r\nequivalent, the paracasein molecule being one-half of the casein\r\nmolecule. Moreover, Bosworth (1913) has shown that, if the rennin\r\ncleavage be carried out under conditions which avoid autohydrolysis, no\r\nother protein is formed; also that, if the calcium caseinate present be\r\none containing four equivalents of calcium, the paracaseinate does not\r\nprecipitate, save in the presence of a soluble calcium salt, while, if\r\nthe calcium caseinate be one of two equivalents of base, rennin does\r\ncause immediate coagulation. Bosworth concludes that the rennin action\r\nis a cleavage (probably hydrolytic) of a molecule of caseinate into two\r\nmolecules of paracaseinate, the coagulation being a secondary effect due\r\nto a change in solubilities, dicalcium paracaseinate being soluble in\r\npure water but not in water containing more than a trace of calcium\r\nsalt, and the monocalcium caseinate being insoluble in water. The alkali\r\nparacaseinates, as well as caseinates, are soluble. This explanation\r\nseems to promise to harmonize the observations with regard to acidity\r\nand the effects of the presence of soluble salts. This theory\r\nrepresents, therefore, many years of continuous work at the New York\r\nExperiment Station centered primarily on American Cheddar cheese.\r\nDisputed points remain for further study but these workers have\r\ncontributed much toward a clear description of the chemical constitution\r\nof casein as affected by rennet action and bacterial activity.\r\n\r\nThe investigations of these authors and of Hart with regard to the\r\nchanges which the paracasein, the calcium and the phosphorus undergo\r\nduring the ripening of cheese (Van Slyke and Hart, 1902, 1905; Van Slyke\r\nand Bosworth, 1907, 1913; Bosworth, 1907) contributed to this\r\ninterpretation.\r\n\r\n   BANG, IVAR, Ueber die chemische Vorgang bei der\r\n   Milchgerinnung durch Lab, Skand.

It is regularly used in precipitating casein not for\r\nfood but for manufacturing purposes.\r\n\r\n+56. Acidifying organisms.+--Many species of bacteria have been shown to\r\npossess the power to produce lactic acid by fermenting lactose. In\r\npractice, however, the cheese-maker seeks to control this fermentation\r\nby the actual introduction of the desired organisms and by the\r\nproduction of conditions which will insure this dominance through\r\nnatural selection. For this purpose the initial souring for most types\r\nof cheeses is produced by some variety of the species originally\r\ndescribed by Esten[23] and commonly referred to as _Bacterium\r\nlactis-acidi_, but variously named as _B. acidi-lactici_, _Streptococcus\r\nlacticus_, _B. guntheri_ by different authors. Organisms of this series\r\ndominate all other species in milk which is incubated at 70° F. They\r\nproduce a smooth solid mass without a sign of gas holes and without the\r\nseparation of whey from the curd, and develop in milk a maximum acidity\r\nof about 0.90 of one per cent when titrated as lactic acid. (For\r\ntitration see Chapter V.) This species is usually present in small\r\nnumbers in fresh milk. There are many varieties or strains of the\r\nspecies with differing rates of activity and measurable differences in\r\nacid produced but with approximately the same qualitative characters.\r\nMost commercial starters for cheese- and butter-making belong to this\r\ngroup of species, although special mixtures with other organisms are\r\nprepared for special purposes. In addition to this group, most varieties\r\nof cheese contain some members of the colon-aërogenes group. When the\r\nmilk is in proper condition, the activity of this group should be held\r\nin check by the early and rapid development of acid. Free development of\r\nmembers of this group usually shows itself in the presence of gas holes\r\nin the curd.\r\n\r\n+57. Starter.+--The practice of using pure cultures in cheese-making has\r\nbrought about the development of factory methods of producing day by day\r\ncultures of the organisms desired, in quantities sufficient to inoculate\r\nthe total quantity of milk used in manufacture. For this purpose milk is\r\nmostly used and the product is known as \"starter.\" For cheese-making\r\npurposes, a starter is a substance used in the manufacture of dairy\r\nproducts having a predominance of lactic acid-forming microorganisms in\r\nan active state. There are two general classes of starter: (1) Natural\r\nstarter; (2) commercial starter.\r\n\r\n+58. Natural starter.+--Milk, or other similar substance, which has\r\nbecome sour or in which large numbers of lactic acid-forming organisms\r\nare present, is called a natural starter when used in the manufacture of\r\ndairy products. To secure clean-flavored milk, the cheese-maker usually\r\nselects the milk of some producer who usually brings good milk and\r\nallows it to sour naturally for use the next day. There is often a\r\nvariation from day to day in the milk delivered by the same producer, so\r\nthat the cheese-maker is not certain of a uniform quality in his\r\nfundamental material. While the lactic acid-forming organisms are\r\ndeveloping, other organisms may also be present in numbers sufficient to\r\nproduce bad flavors. If a starter has any objectionable flavor, it\r\nshould not be used. Natural starters very commonly develop objectionable\r\nflavors which at first are very difficult to recognize. When natural\r\nstarters with objectionable but not easily recognizable odors are used,\r\nthe effect may be seen on the cheese. Milk, sour whey and buttermilk are\r\nmaterials commonly used as natural starter. A common difficulty in\r\nskimmed-milk cheese is caused by the use of buttermilk as a starter.\r\n\r\n+59. Commercial starter or pure cultures.+--The alternative practice\r\nconsists in the introduction of pure cultures of known strains of lactic\r\nbacteria into special milk to make the starter. Since these cultures\r\nmust be prepared by a bacteriologist, commercial laboratories have\r\ndeveloped a large business in their production. Many such commercial\r\nbrands are manufactured under trade-marked names. Some of these cultures\r\nrepresent races of lactic bacteria cultivated and cared for efficiently,\r\nhence uniformly valuable over long periods of time. Others carelessly\r\nproduced are worthless, or even a peril to the user.\r\n\r\nThese organisms are usually shipped in small quantities in bottles of\r\nliquid or powder, or in capsules of uniform size. The contents may be\r\neither the culture medium upon which the organisms grew or inert\r\nsubstance designed merely to hold the bacteria in inactive form. In\r\neither solid or liquid form, the producer of the culture should\r\nguarantee its activity up to a plainly stated date.\r\n\r\nIt is the problem[24] of the cheese-maker or butter-maker to increase\r\nthis small amount of lactic acid-forming organisms to such numbers and\r\nin such active condition that it may be used in the factory; while being\r\nbuilt up, these organisms must be kept pure. The usual practice is to\r\nallow them to develop in some material, usually whole milk or\r\nskimmed-milk; dissolved milk powder may be used in the place of milk.\r\n\r\n+60. Manufacturer's directions.+--The manufacturer usually sends\r\ndirections with his starter preparation, telling how it should be used\r\nto secure the best result. These directions apply to average conditions\r\nand must be varied to suit the individual instances so that a good\r\nstarter will be the result. The directions usually state the amount of\r\nmilk necessary for the first inoculation. It is usually a small amount,\r\none or two quarts. After the specific amount has been selected, this\r\nmilk should be pasteurized.\r\n\r\n+61. Selecting milk.+--The milk for use in starter-making should be\r\nselected with very much care. Only clean-flavored sweet milk, free from\r\nundesirable micro-organisms, should be used in the preparation of\r\nstarter. The milk is ordinarily chosen from a producer whose milk is\r\nusually in good condition. The quality of the milk can be determined by\r\nthe use of the fermentation test. (See Chapter II.) It is better to\r\nchoose only the morning's milk for the making of starter, because the\r\nbacteria have not had so much opportunity to develop. In no case should\r\nthe mixed milk be used in the preparation of starter, as this eliminates\r\nall opportunity for selection. The flavor of the starter will be the\r\nsame as that of the milk from which it is made.\r\n\r\n+62. Pasteurization+ is the process of heating to a high temperature for\r\na given length of time and quickly cooling. It kills most of the\r\nmicro-organisms in the milk. In other words, it makes a clean seed-bed\r\nfor the pure culture. The temperatures of pasteurization recommended for\r\nstarter-making differ with the authority. A temperature of 180° F. for\r\nthirty minutes or longer seems to be very satisfactory, since under\r\nthese conditions nearly all the micro-organisms in the milk are killed.\r\n\r\n+63. Containers.+--Various kinds of containers may be used for\r\nstarter-making. One-quart glass fruit jars or milk bottles make very\r\nsatisfactory containers, because the condition of the starter may be\r\nseen at any time. They are also easily cleaned. They have the\r\ndisadvantage, however, of being easily broken, if the temperature is\r\nsuddenly changed, or if severely jarred. Tin containers may also be\r\nused. Such containers are not easily broken, but they are harder to\r\nclean and must be opened to examine the contents; hence the liability of\r\ncontamination is very much greater.\r\n\r\nThis small amount of milk may be pasteurized by placing the container in\r\nwater heated to the desired temperature. A very satisfactory arrangement\r\nis to cut of a barrel, and place a steam pipe in it. The barrel can then\r\nbe filled partly full of water and heated by steam. The bottles of milk\r\nto be pasteurized are hung in the water in the barrel. Two or three\r\nmore bottles should be prepared than it is expected will be used as some\r\nof the bottles are liable to be broken while cooling or heating. The\r\nbottles should be filled about two-thirds full. This leaves room enough\r\nto add the mother starter and later to break up the starter to examine\r\nit. It is desirable not to have the milk or starter touch the cover\r\nsince contaminations are more likely. It is a good plan when\r\npasteurizing to have one bottle as a check. This may be filled with\r\nwater and left open and the thermometer placed in it. A uniform\r\ntemperature may be obtained by shaking the bottles.\r\n\r\n+64. Adding cultures.+--After being pasteurized, the milk should be\r\ncooled to a temperature of 80° F. This is a suitable temperature for the\r\ndevelopment of the lactic acid-forming organisms. The commercial or pure\r\nculture should now be added to the milk at the rate specified in the\r\ndirections. Care should be exercised in opening bottles not to put the\r\ncovers in an unclean place. A sterile dipper is a good place to put\r\nthem. After the culture has been added to the milk, it should be mixed\r\nthoroughly by shaking the bottle. This should be repeated every fifteen\r\nor twenty minutes for four or five times. This is done to make certain\r\nthat the culture is thoroughly mixed with the milk. The milk should be\r\nplaced in a room or incubator as near 80° F. as possible, in order to\r\nhave a uniform temperature for the growth of the organisms. The bacteria\r\nin the pure culture are more or less dormant so that a somewhat higher\r\ntemperature than the ordinary is necessary to stimulate their activity.\r\nThis milk should be coagulated in eighteen to twenty-four hours,\r\ndepending largely on the uniformity of the temperature during\r\nincubation.\r\n\r\n+65. Cleanliness.+--To produce a good starter, great care should be\r\nexercised that all utensils coming in contact with the milk are sterile.\r\nAfter the milk is in the container in which the starter is made, it\r\nshould be kept covered as continuously as possible. Thermometers should\r\nnot be put into it to ascertain the temperature. When examining the\r\nstarter, do not dip into it, but pour out, as this prevents\r\ncontamination. The cover, when removed from the container, should be put\r\nin a sterile place in such way that the dirt will not stick to it and\r\nlater get into the starter.\r\n\r\n+66. \"Mother\" starter or startoline.+--The thickened sour milk obtained\r\nby inoculating the sweet pasteurized milk with pure culture of lactic\r\nacid-forming bacteria is known as \"mother starter\" or \"startoline.\"\r\n\r\n+67. Examining starter.+--This starter should be examined carefully as\r\nto physical properties, odor and taste. The coagulation should be\r\nsmooth, free from whey and gassy pockets or bubbles. Sometimes the first\r\nfew inoculations from a new culture will show signs of gas, but,\r\nusually, this will quickly disappear, and not injure the starter. It\r\nshould have a clean sour cream odor and clean, mild, acid flavor. After\r\nbreaking up it should be thick and creamy, entirely free from lumps.\r\nThis starter may have an objectionable flavor, due to the media in which\r\nthe organisms were growing when shipped. In such cases it is necessary\r\nto carry the starter one or two propagations to overcome the flavor, to\r\nenliven the micro-organisms and to secure the quantity desired.\r\n\r\n+68. Second day's propagation.+--For the second day, the milk for the\r\nstarter is selected as on the first day. It is pasteurized, and this\r\ntime cooled to 70° F. The milk is cooled a trifle colder the second day\r\nthan the first, because the organisms have become more active and hence\r\ndo not require as high a temperature to grow. Instead of inoculating\r\nwith powder, as was done the first day, the mother starter prepared the\r\nfirst day is used. This requires only a very small amount, perhaps a\r\ntablespoonful to a quart bottle. It should be thoroughly mixed with the\r\nmilk. This starter may have the flavor of the media used in the\r\nlaboratory culture, therefore may need to be carried one or two days\r\nmore to eliminate it. After the flavor has become normal, the mother\r\nstarter is ready for commercial use.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 6.--An improved starter-can.]\r\n\r\n+69. Preparation of larger amount of starter.+--The first thing to\r\ndetermine is the quantity of starter required. As much milk should be\r\ncarefully chosen as the amount of starter desired. This milk should then\r\nbe pasteurized. An improved starter-can (Fig. 6) may be used in the\r\npasteurization of the milk and the making of starter, or a milk-can\r\n(Fig. 7) placed in a tub of water in which there is a steam pipe. The\r\nformer requires mechanical power to operate the agitator, but the latter\r\ncan be used where mechanical power is not available. In the latter the\r\nmilk and starter are stirred by hand. This is the kind of apparatus more\r\noften found in cheese factories.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 7.--A simple device for the preparation of starter.]\r\n\r\nIf possible, this milk should be pasteurized to 180° F. for thirty\r\nminutes; this kills most of the bacteria and spores. The milk should be\r\ncooled to 60°-65° F., the temperature of incubation. This temperature\r\nmay be varied with conditions, so that the starter will be ready for use\r\nat the desired time. The higher the temperature, the less time is\r\nrequired to ripen the starter.\r\n\r\n+70. Amount of mother starter to use.+--The mother starter prepared the\r\nday before is now used to inoculate the starter milk. The amount to use\r\nwill depend on:\r\n\r\n1. Temperature of milk when mother starter is added;\r\n\r\n2. Average temperature at which the milk will be kept during the\r\nripening period;\r\n\r\n3. Time allowed for starter to ripen before it is to be used;\r\n\r\n4. Vigor and acidity of the mother starter added. There is a very wide\r\nrange as to the amount of mother starter required, from 0.5 of one per\r\ncent to 10 per cent being used under different conditions.\r\n\r\nSome operators prefer to add the mother starter while the milk is at a\r\ntemperature of about 90° F., before it has been cooled to the incubating\r\ntemperature. This reduces the amount of mother starter necessary.\r\n\r\nIf an even incubating temperature can be maintained, it will require\r\nless mother starter than if the temperature goes down.\r\n\r\nIf the ripening period is short, it will require a larger amount of\r\nmother starter, than if the ripening period is longer. If the starter\r\nhas a low acidity or weak body indicating that organisms are of low\r\nvitality, it will require more mother starter.\r\n\r\n+71. Qualities.+--The starter, when ready to use, may or may not be\r\ncoagulated; a good idea of the quality of the starter may be gained by\r\nthe condition of the coagulation. The coagulation should be jelly- or\r\ncustard-like, close and smooth, entirely free from gas pockets and\r\nshould not be wheyed off.\r\n\r\nWhen broken up, the starter should be of a smooth creamy texture and\r\nentirely free from lumpiness or wateriness. It should have a slightly\r\npronounced acid aroma. The starter should be free from taints and all\r\nundesirable flavors; the flavor should be a clean, mild acid taste.\r\n\r\n+72. How to carry the mother starter.+--Some mother starter must be\r\ncarried from day to day to inoculate the large starter. This may be\r\ncarried or made in several ways:\r\n\r\n1. Independently: By this method a mother starter is made and carried\r\nentirely separately from the large starter. It requires more time and\r\nwork, but is by far the best method. With a good mother starter, there\r\nis not so much danger of the larger starter becoming poor in quality.\r\n\r\n2. Mother starter may be made by dipping pasteurized milk from that\r\nprepared for the large starter with sterile jars and then inoculating\r\nthese jars separately. By this method, if the milk selected for the\r\nlarge starter is poor, the mother starter for the next day will be the\r\nsame. It is very difficult by this method to carry a uniform, high\r\nquality mother starter.\r\n\r\nThere is danger that the container used for the mother starter may not\r\nbe sterile, and there is also danger of contamination in transferring\r\nthe milk.\r\n\r\n3. Another practice is to hold over some of the large starter used\r\nto-day for mother starter. This is by far the easiest method. By this\r\npractice, there is no certainty of the quality of the starter, because\r\nthere is little or no control of the mother starter. If the large\r\nstarter is for some reason not good, there is no separate reserve of\r\nmother starter on which to rely.\r\n\r\n+73. Starter score-cards.+--The use of a score-card tends to analyze the\r\nobservations in such a way as to emphasize all the characteristics\r\ndesired in the starter. Such an analysis seeks to minimize the personal\r\nfactor and produce a standardization of the quality. The score-card\r\nfinally reduces the qualities of the starter to a numerical basis for\r\nease of comparison. Many score-cards have been proposed but the one\r\npreferred by the authors is that used by the Dairy Department of the New\r\nYork State College of Agriculture, which is as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n           CORNELL SCORE-CARD\r\n\r\n  Flavor     50 Clean, desirable acid.\r\n\r\n  Aroma      20 Clean, agreeable acid. No undesirable aroma.\r\n\r\n  Acidity    20 0.6 per cent-0.8 per cent.\r\n\r\n  Body       10 Before breaking up: jelly-like, close,\r\n                  absence of gas holes. No free\r\n                  whey. After breaking up:\r\n                  smooth, creamy, free from granules\r\n                  or flakes.\r\n\r\nThe qualities mentioned in this score-card can be quickly and easily\r\ndetermined by examining and tasting the starter and by making an acid\r\ntest of a sample. The acid test is conducted as with milk (see Chapter\r\nII) except the starter must be rinsed out of the pipette with pure\r\nwater. Some starter score-cards call for a bacterial examination and\r\ncounting of the starter organisms. This takes a considerable period of\r\ntime and is not entirely necessary. The physical properties and acid\r\ntest are closely correlated with the presence of the desired organisms.\r\n\r\n+74. Use of starter.+--If all milk could be clean and sweet and the only\r\nfermentation from it were the clean acid type, a starter would be\r\nuseless. Such milk is hard to obtain; therefore, a starter is used to\r\novercome the bad fermentation. This improves the flavor, body and\r\ntexture of the cheese. The common contaminations which the starter will\r\ntend to correct are:\r\n\r\n  1. Gas-producing bacteria.\r\n  2. Yeasts.\r\n  3. Bad flavors or taints.\r\n\r\nThe length of time a starter may be carried depends on the accuracy and\r\ncarefulness of the maker. This calls for scrupulous attention to the\r\ntemperature, the selection of milk and keeping out contaminations. The\r\nmaker must remember that a starter is not merely milk, but milk full of\r\na multitude of tiny plants, very sensitive to food, temperature, clean\r\nsurroundings and the quantity of their own acid.\r\n\r\n\r\n     NEW YORK STATE COLLEGE OF AGRICULTURE AT CORNELL UNIVERSITY\r\n\r\n       +STARTER LOT-CARD+            +Department of Dairy Industry.+\r\n  ==================================================================\r\n                        Day and Date_____________________\r\n\r\n  +MILK:+\r\n\r\n  Kind________________ % fat_____% solids not fat_____\r\n\r\n  Flavor__________________________________\r\n\r\n  Amount of milk____________   Hours old______________\r\n\r\n  +PASTEURIZATION:+\r\n\r\n  Method______________________________________________\r\n\r\n  Milk when received: Temperature_____ °\r\n\r\n        Acidity_____ %\r\n\r\n  Heating: Turning on heat__________ APM.\r\n\r\n        Desired temp. reached__________ APM.\r\n\r\n        Turning off heat__________ APM.\r\n\r\n        Length of time at desired temp.__________\r\n\r\n        Beginning to cool__________\r\n\r\n        Cooled__________ APM; to__________ °\r\n\r\n  Acidity: After pasteurization__________\r\n\r\n        When inoculated________________\r\n\r\n  +INOCULATION:+\r\n\r\n        Time__________ Temperature__________\r\n\r\n        Amount__________ lbs.   __________%\r\n\r\n  +INCUBATION:+\r\n\r\n  Temperature__________   Time__________\r\n\r\n  +MOTHER STARTER USED:+\r\n\r\n  Source_____________________________________  % used_______________\r\n\r\n  Times propagated___________________________  Acidity______________\r\n\r\n  Amount used________________________________  Appearance___________\r\n\r\n              Flavor_______________________________\r\n\r\n  Comments__________________________________________________________\r\n\r\n  +STARTER:+\r\n\r\n  Time of examining__________\r\n\r\n  Temperature________________\r\n\r\n                          +SCORE-CARD:+\r\n\r\n  Flavor__________50|    Clean, desirable acid.\r\n                    |\r\n  Aroma___________20|    Clean, agreeable acid.

The amount of starter to use+ depends on the amount of acid desired\r\nin the milk for any particular kind of cheese. The great abuse of\r\nstarter is the practice of using too much. It is better and safer to add\r\nstarter a little at a time and several times than to add too much at\r\nonce. When starter is added to milk for cheese-making, it should be\r\nstrained to remove any lumps; otherwise an uneven color is likely to\r\nresult.\r\n\r\n+76. Starter lot-card.+--For certain dairy operations, a permanent\r\nrecord is desired. This is especially true in the making of starter and\r\ncertain varieties of cheese. A lot-card not only serves as a record but\r\nalso points out the succeeding steps of the operation. This latter is\r\nespecially useful for beginners and students. Page 53 shows a desirable\r\nlot-card to be used when making starter. Each operation has been\r\nreferred to the page in the text where it is discussed. This makes this\r\nparticular lot-card an index to the whole process of starter-making as\r\nhere treated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\n_CURD-MAKING_\r\n\r\n\r\nAside from the purely sour-milk cheeses, the coagulum or curd resulting\r\nfrom rennet action is the basis of cheese-making. The finished cheese,\r\nwhatever its final condition, is primarily dependent on a particular\r\nchemical composition and fairly definite physical characters in the\r\nfreshly made curd mass. These characters are determined by a series of\r\nfactors under control of the cheese-maker. Assuming the milk to be\r\nnormal in character, success depends on the use of a proper combination\r\nof these factors. The possible variations in each factor together with\r\ntheir number makes an almost infinite series of such combinations\r\npossible. The essential steps in the process are, therefore, presented\r\nas underlying all cheese-making. The special adaptations of each factor\r\nare considered in the discussion of the varieties group by group.\r\n\r\nThese factors follow:\r\n\r\n  _A._ The coagulation group:\r\n\r\n  1. Fat-content of the milk.\r\n  2. The acidity of the milk.\r\n  3. The temperature of renneting.\r\n  4. The effective quantity of rennet.\r\n  5. Curdling period or the time allowed for rennet action.\r\n\r\n  _B._ The handling group:\r\n\r\n  6. Cutting or breaking the curd.\r\n  7. Heating (cooking) or not heating.\r\n  8. Draining (including pressing, grinding and putting into hoops\r\n  or forms).\r\n\r\n+77. The composition of the milk.+--The fat percentage in the milk in\r\nthe cheese-vat should be known to the cheese-maker and be strictly under\r\nhis control. The fat tester and the separator make this clearly\r\npossible. He can go further. Milk from particular herds whose quality is\r\na matter of record from the routine test of each patron's milk may be\r\nselected and brought together for the manufacturer of cheese of special\r\nquality. Control of casein or lactose, on the contrary, is not nearly so\r\npracticable. The purchase of milk on the fat test has become so well\r\nestablished in most dairy territories, as to insure the presence and\r\nconstant use of the tester. A fat test of the mixed product in the\r\ncheese-vat in connection with established tables thus insures an\r\naccurate knowledge of the materials which go into each day's cheese. For\r\nsome varieties of cheese, whole milk should always be used. For other\r\nvarieties, the addition or removal of fat is regularly recognized as\r\npart of the making process. The presence of added fat or the removal of\r\nfat affects the texture of the product and the details of the process of\r\nmaking.\r\n\r\n+78. Cheese color.+--An alkaline solution of annatto is usually used as\r\na cheese color. This colors both casein and fat in contrast to butter\r\ncolor which is an oil solution of the dye and mixes only with the fat.\r\nCheese color is added to the milk in making some varieties of cheese,\r\nand not for others. When lactic starter is used, the color should be\r\nadded after the starter and just before the addition of the rennet. The\r\namount is determined by the color desired in the cheese. The usual\r\namount varies from one to four ounces to each thousand pounds of milk.\r\nBefore adding, the color should be diluted in either milk or water,\r\npreferably water. It should then be mixed thoroughly with the milk.\r\n\r\n+79. The acidity factor.+--Milk as drawn shows a measurable acidity when\r\ntitrated to phenolphthalein with normal sodium hydroxide. This figure\r\nvaries with the composition of milk. Casein itself gives a weakly acid\r\nreaction with this indicator. Calculated as lactic acid, this initial\r\nacidity varies within fairly wide limits, records being found from 0.12\r\nto 0.21 of one per cent or even more widely apart. Commonly, however,\r\nsuch titration shows 0.14 to 0.17 per cent. Some forms of cheese\r\n(Limburger, Swiss, Brie) are made from absolutely fresh milk. Acidity\r\nfrom bacterial activity is important as a factor in the making of most\r\ntypes of cheese and probably in the ripening of all types.\r\n\r\nIncreasing the acidity of the milk hastens rennet action and within\r\nlimits produces increased firmness of the curd. If carried too high,\r\nacidity causes a grainy or sandy curd. Normally fresh milk is\r\nsufficiently acid in reaction when tested to phenolphthalein to permit\r\nrennet to act, but the rate of action increases rapidly with the\r\ndevelopment of acid. Increase of acidity may be accomplished: (_a_) by\r\nthe addition of acid as has been done by Sammis[25] and Bruhn in\r\npasteurized milk for Cheddar cheese; or (_b_) by the development of acid\r\nthrough the activity of lactic organisms, which is the usual way. For\r\nrenneting, the acidity necessary for particular cheeses runs from that\r\nof absolutely fresh milk still warm (as in French Brie, Limburger,\r\nSwiss, Gorgonzola) through series calling for increase of acidity,\r\nhundredth by hundredth per cent calculated as lactic acid. This ranges\r\nfrom 0.17 to 0.20 per cent as is variously used in American factory\r\nCheddar to about 0.25 to 0.28 per cent as obtained by adding acid in\r\nSammis' method. This method is discussed under the heading \"Cheddar\r\nCheese from Pasteurized Milk\" (p. 229) since it requires special\r\napparatus and has not thus far been used with other types of cheese. For\r\nthe development of acidity by the action of bacteria, lactic starter is\r\nalmost universally used. This may be added in very small quantities and\r\nthe acidity secured by closely watching its development or by adding\r\nstarter in amount sufficient to obtain the required acidity at once. In\r\neither case, the cheese-maker needs to know the rate of action of the\r\nculture to insure the proper control of the process. The amount of acid\r\nalready present when the rennet is added affects not only the texture of\r\nthe curd as first found, but within limits indicates also the rate at\r\nwhich further acidity may be expected to develop.\r\n\r\nA series of experiments in making Roquefort were tabulated to show the\r\nrate of acidification from various initial points. In the graphs (Fig.\r\n8) the curves for acid development are parallel after the determination\r\nreaches 0.30 per cent. These experiments were made at a temperature 80°\r\nto 84° F. Milk at the lowest acidities tried developed titratable acid\r\nvery slowly. A period of several hours was required to produce\r\nsufficient acid to affect the curd texture. When the acid reached 0.25\r\nper cent by titration, the further rise was rapid and all the lines\r\nbecame almost straight and parallel after the titration reached 0.30\r\nper cent. If this rapid souring occurred after the completion of the\r\ncheese-making process, the texture of the experimental cheese was not\r\nmeasurably affected. In those cases, however, in which 0.30 per cent was\r\nreached before the cheese reached its final form in the hoop, the\r\ntexture of the ripened cheese was entirely different from that desired\r\nfor this variety under experiment. These curves apply directly to but\r\none cheese process in which a particular combination of acidity, rennet\r\nand time is used to obtain a very delicately balanced result. In other\r\nvarieties it is equally important to obtain exactly the adjustment of\r\nthese factors which will bring the desired result.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 8.--The acidification of Roquefort cheese.]\r\n\r\n+80. Acidity of milk when received.+--If proper care has been taken,\r\nmilk should be delivered to the factory fresh, clean and without the\r\ndevelopment of acid. If the milk has not been handled properly, the\r\nearly stages of souring or some other unfavorable fermentation will have\r\ndeveloped. Such milk may develop too much acid, or gas, or any one of\r\nseveral objectionable flavors during the making and ripening of the\r\ncheese. Some cheese-makers become very expert in detecting the first\r\ntraces of objectionable qualities, but most makers are dependent on\r\nstandardized tests to determine whether milk shall be accepted or\r\nrejected, and when accepted to determine the rate at which it may be\r\nexpected to respond during the cheese-making process.\r\n\r\nVarious tests have been devised to determine the amount of acid present\r\nin milk. There are two tests commonly used in cheese-factories. One is\r\nknown as the \"acid test\" and the other the \"rennet test.\"\r\n\r\n+81. The acid test+[26] is made by titrating a known amount of milk\r\n(Fig. 9) against an alkali solution of known strength, using\r\nphenolphthalein as an indicator. The object of the indicator is to tell\r\nthe condition of the milk, whether it is acid, alkaline or neutral. The\r\nindicator does not change in an acid solution but turns pink when the\r\nsolution is or becomes alkaline. To make the test, a known quantity of\r\nthe material to be tested is placed in a white cup, and to this several\r\ndrops of indicator are added. As an indicator, a 1 per cent solution of\r\nphenolphthalein in 95 per cent alcohol is commonly used. As an alkali\r\nsolution, sodium hydroxide (NaOH) is used in the standardized strength\r\nusually either tenth (N/10) normal or twentieth (N/20) normal. This\r\nsolution should be obtained in some one of the standardized forms\r\ncommercially prepared. The alkali is added, drop by drop, from a\r\ngraduated burette until a faint pink color appears. This shows that the\r\nacid in the milk has been neutralized by the alkali. The amount of\r\nalkali that has been used can be determined from the burette. Knowing\r\nthe amount of milk and alkali solution used, it is easy to calculate the\r\namount of acid in the substance tested. The results are usually\r\nexpressed either as percentages of lactic acid or preferably as cubic\r\ncentimeters of normal alkali required to neutralize 100 or 1000 c.c. of\r\nmilk. This kind of test is on the market under different names, such as\r\nMann's, Publow's, Farrington's and Marschall's.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _FIG. 9._--An acid tester.]\r\n\r\n+82. Rennet tests.+--Several rennet tests have been devised, but the one\r\nmost widely used is the Marschall (Fig. 10). This consists of a 1 c.c.\r\npipette to measure the rennet extract, a small bottle in which to dilute\r\nthe extract, a special cup to hold the milk and a spatula to mix the\r\nmilk with the rennet extract. This cup has on the inside from top to\r\nbottom a scale graduated from 0 at the top to 10 at the bottom. There is\r\na hole in the bottom to allow the milk to run out.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 10.--Marschall rennet test.]\r\n\r\n+83. Marschall rennet test.+--To make a Marschall rennet test, 1 c.c. of\r\nrennet extract is measured, with the 1 c.c. pipette, and placed in the\r\nbottle. Care should be exercised to rinse out the pipette. The bottle is\r\nthen filled to the mark with cold water. After the milk has been heated\r\nto the setting temperature, 84°-86° F., the cup is filled with milk and\r\nset on the edge of the vat so that the milk running out through the hole\r\nin the bottom of the cup will flow into the vat. Just as the surface of\r\nthe milk reaches the 0 mark on the cup, the diluted rennet extract is\r\nadded and thoroughly mixed with the milk, using the small spatula to\r\nstir it. The rennet and milk should be mixed until it has run down at\r\nleast one-half space on the scale in the cup. As the rennet begins to\r\ncoagulate the milk, it runs slower from the hole in the bottom of the\r\ncup, until it finally stops. When it stops, the point on the scale\r\nindicated by the surface of the coagulated milk is noted. The test is\r\nrecorded by the number of spaces the surface of the milk lowers from the\r\ntime the rennet is added until it is coagulated. This test depends on\r\nthree factors: the strength of the rennet extract, the temperature of\r\nthe milk, the acidity of the milk. The more acid, the quicker the milk\r\nwill coagulate. To measure any one of these factors, the other two must\r\nbe constant. The variable factor is the acidity of the milk. This test\r\nwill not indicate the percentage of acid in the milk, but is simply a\r\ncomparative test to be used from day to day; for example, if the rennet\r\ntest to-day shows three spaces, and the operator makes that milk into\r\ncheese and the process seems to be normal, it shows that for good\r\nresults in this factory, milk should be ripened to show three spaces\r\nevery day. If the next day the milk showed four spaces, it should be\r\nallowed to ripen more until it shows three spaces. If it shows only two\r\nspaces, this indicates that the milk has too much acid development or is\r\nover-ripe. A cheese-maker will have to determine at what point to set\r\nhis milk, because the test will vary from one factory to another.\r\n\r\n+84. Comparison of acid and rennet test.+--Each of these tests has its\r\nadvantages and disadvantages. The advantage of the acid test is that it\r\ncan be made as well of warm as cold milk. This is of great importance in\r\ndetermining whether the milk delivered by any patron is too ripe to be\r\nreceived. The acidity of other materials, such as whey and starter, can\r\nbe determined as well as that of milk. The disadvantages are that it is\r\ndifficult to get the alkali solution of the proper strength and the\r\nsolution is liable to deteriorate on standing. It requires a careful\r\nexact operator to make the test.\r\n\r\nThe advantages of the rennet test are that it is easy to make, and it\r\nrequires no materials that are hard to replace. The disadvantage is that\r\nthe milk must be warmed to the same temperature before a comparative\r\ntest can be made. The size of the outlet in cups varies. It does not\r\nindicate the percentage of acid present in the milk. It is simply a\r\ncomparative test. To obtain the best result, both tests should be used\r\nin conjunction.\r\n\r\n+85. Control of acid.+--The control of acidity in curd and cheese is\r\ndependent on the control of the moisture or water-content. The control\r\nof both factors is very important in relation to the quality[27] of the\r\ncheese. Often acidity is spoken of when moisture is really intended, and\r\nvice versa. The close relation between the moisture and acidity is due\r\nto the presence of the milk-sugar in solution in the milk-serum which\r\nbecomes the whey of cheese-making. Water or moisture in cheese consists\r\nof the remnant of this whey which is not expelled in the making process.\r\nDuring manufacture and the ripening process, the milk-sugar is changed\r\nto lactic acid. A cheese may be sweet when first made and after a time\r\nbecome sour because it contains too much moisture in the form of whey.\r\nExcess of whey carries excess of milk-sugar from which fermentation\r\nproduces intense acidity.\r\n\r\nVarious tests have been devised to determine the amount of acid\r\ndeveloped at the different stages of manufacture. These tests are\r\ndescribed on page 61. By the use of such tests, the development of acid\r\nduring the manufacturing process can be very accurately determined.\r\nThere is no quick, accurate test to determine the amount of moisture in\r\nthe curd. The cheese-maker has to rely on his own judgment, guided\r\nlargely by the appearance, feeling and condition of the curd.\r\n\r\nAfter the rennet extract has been added, all control of the acid\r\ndevelopment is lost. The cheese-maker can determine rather accurately\r\nhow fast the acid will develop during the ripening of the milk. This\r\nshows the importance of the proper ripening. The amount of acid\r\ndeveloped during the different stages of the manufacturing process can\r\nbe approximately followed with the various acid tests. The manufacturing\r\nprocess should then be varied to obtain the proper relation between the\r\nmoisture and the acid present. The only time that the acidity may be\r\ncontrolled is when the milk is being ripened. If too much acid is\r\ndeveloped before the rennet is added, there is apt to be too much acid\r\nat each stage of the manufacturing process. This is liable to hurry the\r\ncheese-making process and to cause a loss, both in quality and quantity\r\nof cheese, and may cause a high acid or sour cheese. If sufficient acid\r\nis not developed at the time the rennet is added or if the milk is not\r\nsufficiently ripened, the acid is liable not to develop fast enough so\r\nthat there will not be sufficient at each step in the cheese-making\r\nprocess. Such a cheese is called \"sweet.\" There are several conditions\r\nwhich will cause an over-development of acid. Such a cheese is called\r\n\"acidy\" or \"sour.\" These factors are within the control of the\r\ncheese-maker, hence should be avoided. A sour cheese shows lack of skill\r\nand care on the part of the cheese-maker.\r\n\r\n_Conditions causing an acidy or sour cheese:_\r\n\r\n  Receiving sour or high acid milk at the cheese-factory.\r\n  Use of too much starter.\r\n  Ripening the milk too much before the rennet is added.\r\n  Removing the whey before the curd is properly firmed, hence leaving\r\n    it with too much moisture.\r\n  Development of too much acid in the whey before the whey is removed.\r\n  Improper relationship between the moisture and acidity at the time\r\n    of removing the whey.\r\n\r\n_Conditions causing deficient acid:_\r\n\r\n  Adding the rennet before sufficient acid has developed.\r\n  Not using sufficient starter.\r\n  Not developing sufficient acid in the whey.\r\n\r\n+86. Acidity and rennet action.+--The rennet extract acts only in an\r\nacid medium. The greater the acid development, within certain limits,\r\nthe faster the action of the rennet. If enough acid has developed to\r\ncause a coagulation of the casein, the rennet will not coagulate the\r\nmilk. This is one reason why Cheddar cheese cannot be made from sour\r\nmilk.\r\n\r\n+87. Acidity and expulsion of the whey.+--The contraction of the curd\r\nand expulsion of the whey are so closely related that they may be\r\ntreated under the same heading. The more acid, the faster the whey\r\nseparates from the curd, other conditions being uniform. The relation of\r\nacidity and firmness of the curd to temperature of the curd is another\r\nimportant factor in the successful manufacture of cheese. The higher the\r\nacidity, the faster the temperature of the curd can be raised without\r\nany harmful effects. If the temperature is raised too fast in relation\r\nto the acidity, the film surrounding each piece of curd will become\r\ntoughened so that the moisture will not be able to escape. When this\r\ncondition exists, the curd will feel firm but when the pieces are\r\nbroken open the inside is found to be very soft. This results in a large\r\nloss later or may cause a sour cheese. It usually causes an uneven\r\ntexture and color in the cheese.\r\n\r\n+88. Acidity in relation to cheese flavor.+--Just what part the acid\r\nplays in the development of cheese flavor is not known. If a certain\r\namount of acid is not present, the characteristic cheese flavor does not\r\ndevelop. If too much acid is developed, it gives the cheese a sour\r\nflavor which is unpleasant. If sufficient acid is not developed, the\r\nother undesirable factors seem to be more active, causing very\r\ndisagreeable flavor and may cause the cheese to putrefy. A cheese with a\r\nlow acid usually develops a very mild flavor, and if carried to\r\nextremes, as in the case of some washed curd cheese, the true cheese\r\nflavor never develops.\r\n\r\n+89. Acidity in relation to body and texture of cheese.+--If a cheese is\r\nto have a close, smooth, mellow, silky body and texture, a certain\r\namount of acid development is necessary. If too much acid is developed,\r\nthe body and texture will be dry, harsh, sandy, mealy, corky. If the\r\nacid is not sufficient the cheese may be soft or weak bodied, and is\r\nusually characterized by \"Swiss curd holes,\" which are spaces of various\r\nsizes usually more or less round and very shiny on the inside.\r\n\r\n+90. Acidity in relation to cheese color.+--An over-development of\r\nacidity affects the color of a cheese. If this development of acidity is\r\nuniform throughout the cheese, it causes the color to become pale or\r\nbleached. If this development is uneven, due to the uneven distribution\r\nof moisture, the color will be bleached in spots, causing a mottled\r\neffect.\r\n\r\n+91. Control of moisture.+[28]--The cheese-maker must use skill and\r\njudgment in regulating the amount of moisture in relation to the\r\nfirmness of the curd and the acid. Since there are no quick accurate\r\ntests to determine the amount of moisture, this is left entirely to the\r\njudgment of the operator. Certain methods of handling the curd reduce\r\nthe moisture-content, while others increase it. The cheese-maker must\r\ndecide how to handle the curd. If the curd becomes too dry, methods\r\nshould be employed to increase the moisture, and vice versa.\r\n\r\n_Causes of excessive moisture:_\r\n\r\n  Cutting the curd coarse.\r\n  Cutting the curd after it has become too hard.\r\n  Setting the milk at a high temperature.\r\n  Use of excessive amount of rennet extract.\r\n  Low acid in the curd at the time of removing the whey.\r\n  Not stirring the curd with the hands as the last of the whey is\r\n    removed.\r\n  High piling of the curd during the cheddaring process.\r\n  Piling the curd too quickly after removing the whey.\r\n  Use of a small amount of salt.\r\n  Holding the curd at too low a temperature after the whey is removed.\r\n  Soaking the curd in water previous to salting.\r\n  Allowing the curd to remain in the whey too long so that it reabsorbs\r\n    the whey.\r\n  Heating the curd too rapidly.\r\n\r\n_Causes of insufficient moisture:_\r\n\r\n  Cutting the curd too fine or breaking up the pieces with the rake into\r\n    too small pieces.\r\n  Cutting the curd too soft.\r\n  Stirring the curd too much by hand as the last of the whey is being\r\n    removed.\r\n  Developing high acid in the curd at the time of removing the whey.\r\n  Insufficient piling of the curd during the cheddaring process.\r\n  Using a large amount of salt.\r\n  High temperature and low humidity in the curing room.\r\n\r\n+92. Relation of moisture to manufacture and quality.+--(1) _Flavor:_ If\r\nthe cheese contains too much moisture, it is likely to develop a sour or\r\nacidy flavor. A cheese with a normally high moisture-content usually\r\nripens or develops a cheese flavor much faster than one with a lower\r\nmoisture-content, other conditions being uniform. A cheese with a high\r\nmoisture-content is much more liable, during the curing process, to\r\ndevelop undesirable flavors than is one with a lower moisture-content.\r\n(2) _Body and texture:_ A cheese containing too much moisture is very\r\nsoft and is difficult to hold in shape. Such a product breaks down very\r\nrapidly and is usually pasty and sticky in texture. If too little\r\nmoisture is present, the cheese is very dry and hard, and cures or\r\nripens very slowly because of the lack of moisture together with\r\nmilk-sugar from which acid may be formed. Dry cheeses are usually harsh,\r\ntough and rubbery in texture. Such cheeses also have poor rinds. (3)\r\n_Color:_ If the ideal conditions exist, the moisture will be evenly\r\ndistributed throughout the cheese. The spots containing more moisture\r\nwill be lighter in color. If a cheese contains so much moisture that it\r\nbecomes \"acidy,\" the effect is the same as when too much acid is\r\ndeveloped, that is, the color becomes pale from the action of the acid.\r\n(4) _Finish:_ A cheese containing too much moisture is usually soft. A\r\ngood rind does not form. Such a cheese loses its shape very easily,\r\nespecially in a warm curing room. (5) _Quality:_ A cheese with a high\r\nmoisture-content is usually marketable for only a very short period.\r\nSuch a product usually develops flavor very quickly in comparison to a\r\ndry cheese. It must be sold very soon because if held too long, the\r\nflavor becomes so strong as to be undesirable, and objectionable flavors\r\nare liable to develop. In some cases, such cheeses rot.\r\n\r\n+93. Relation of moisture to acidity.+--From the preceding discussion,\r\nit is evident that the relation between the moisture and acidity is very\r\nclose, in fact so intimate that in some cases it is difficult to\r\ndistinguish one from the other when the quality of the cheese is\r\nconsidered. The proper relation of the moisture and the acidity\r\ndetermines the quality of the resulting cheese. If too much acid is\r\ndeveloped during the manufacturing process, the product will be sour. If\r\ntoo much moisture is retained in the form of whey, the cheese will be\r\nsour. The less acid in the curd, the more moisture in the form of whey\r\nmay be retained in the curd without causing a sour cheese. The proper\r\nrelationship between the moisture and the acidity must be maintained or\r\na sour cheese will result.\r\n\r\nThe relation of the moisture to the acidity also has an influence on the\r\ncuring. If the cheese has a low development of acidity and a low\r\nmoisture-content, it will cure very slowly. The increasing of either the\r\nacidity or moisture usually increases the rate of cheese ripening, other\r\nfactors being the same.\r\n\r\nThe relation of the acidity and the moisture is so important that it\r\ncannot be neglected without injuring both the quality and quantity of\r\ncheese. This knowledge can be obtained only by experience.\r\n\r\n+94. Setting temperature.+--The temperature of renneting makes very much\r\ndifference in the texture of the product. The enzyme rennin is sensitive\r\nto very slight changes in temperature. Below 70° F., its rate of action\r\nis very slow. Beginning with approximately 20 per cent of its maximum\r\neffectiveness at 70° F. (the curdling point for Neufchâtel), it has\r\nrisen to 65 per cent at 84° F., to 70 per cent at 86° F., as used in\r\nCheddar, to about 80 to 85 per cent at 90-94° F., as used in Limburger.\r\nAt 105° F. it reaches its maximum effective working rate to fall from\r\nthat efficiency to about 50 per cent at 120° F. Curdling at low\r\ntemperature lengthens the time required for the same amount of rennet to\r\ncurdle a given quantity of the same milk. The texture of curd produced\r\nat temperatures between 70° F. and 84° F. is soft, jelly-like, friable\r\nrather than rubbery. At 86° F. it begins to show toughening or rubbery\r\ncharacters which become very marked at 90° F. to 94° F. as used in\r\nLimburger. With the increased vigor of action as it passes its maximum\r\nrate of action at 105° F., the texture tends to become loose, floccose\r\nto granular. Aside from the Neufchâtel group, the working range of\r\ntemperatures for the renneting period runs from about 84° F. to about\r\n94° F., a range of barely 10° F., or the use of 65 per cent to 80 or\r\npossibly 85 per cent of the maximum efficiency of the rennet. Within\r\nthis range of temperature, the curd has the physical characters demanded\r\nfor making most varieties of cheese.\r\n\r\n+95. Strength of coagulating materials.+--Rennet and pepsin preparations\r\nvary in strength and in keeping quality. With a particular stock,\r\nchanges go on to such a degree that the last samples from a barrel of\r\nrennet are much weaker than the earlier ones. Each sample, barrel, keg\r\nor bottle should be tested before used. In continuous work the results\r\nof each day's work furnish the guide for the next day's use of a\r\nparticular lot of rennet.\r\n\r\n+96. Amount of coagulating materials to use.+--For most varieties of\r\ncheese, sufficient rennet extract or pepsin is added to the milk to give\r\na firm curd in twenty-five to forty minutes. Of the ordinary commercial\r\nrennet extract, this requires from two and one-half to four ounces to\r\none thousand pounds of milk. This gives a maximum of one part rennet for\r\neach four to six thousand parts of milk. The great strength of the\r\nrennet extract is thus clearly shown.\r\n\r\n+97. Method of adding rennet.+--Before rennet is added to the milk, it\r\nis diluted in about forty times its volume of cold water, which chills\r\nthe enzyme and retards its action until it can be thoroughly mixed with\r\nthe milk. If the material is added without such dilution, the\r\nconcentrated extract produces instant coagulation in the drops with\r\nwhich it comes in contact, forming solid masses from which the enzyme\r\nescapes only slowly to diffuse throughout the mass. Uniform coagulation\r\nthus becomes impossible. After the rennet extract has been diluted with\r\ncold water, it should be distributed the entire length of the vat in an\r\neven stream from a pail. It should then be mixed with the milk by\r\nstirring from top to bottom for about three to four minutes. For this\r\npurpose, either a long-handled dipper or a wooden rake may be used. A\r\ndipperful should be drawn from the gate and stirred into the vat,\r\notherwise the milk in the gate will fail to coagulate properly because\r\nthe rennet diffuses too slowly to reach and affect all the milk at that\r\npoint. The milk should be stirred on the top, preferably with the bottom\r\nof a dipper, until signs of coagulation begin to appear. This stirring\r\nkeeps the cream from rising. There are various ways or signs to indicate\r\nwhen the coagulation has gone to the stage at which the mix is about to\r\nbecome thick: (1) The milk becomes lazy or thicker as the finger is\r\npassed through it; (2) bubbles caused by moving the finger remain on the\r\nmilk longer, usually until one can count ten when ready to thicken.\r\n\r\nIf the milk is stirred too long or after it begins to thicken, the\r\nresult is a granular sort of curd, and there will be an abnormally large\r\nloss of fat in the manufacturing process. The addition of the rennet and\r\nsubsequent stirring require the exercise of great care and constant\r\nattention to details. The cheese-maker can do nothing else for those few\r\nminutes. When through stirring, it is a good plan in cold weather to\r\ncover the vat with a cloth as this will keep the surface of the curd\r\nwarm. In summer the same cover will keep out the flies.\r\n\r\n_Causes of a delayed coagulation:_\r\n\r\n  (1) Weak rennet extract or too small an amount.\r\n  (2) Low temperatures due to inaccurate thermometers.\r\n  (3) Pasteurized milk.\r\n  (4) Presence of abnormal bacterial ferments.\r\n  (5) Presence of preservatives.\r\n  (6) Heavily watered milk.\r\n  (7) Use of badly rusted[29] cans.\r\n  (8) Milk containing small amounts of casein or calcium salts.\r\n\r\n_Causes of uneven coagulation:_\r\n\r\n  (1) Uneven temperature of the mix in the vat, due to lack of\r\n        agitation.\r\n  (2) Uneven distribution of the rennet extract.\r\n  (3) Adding rennet to vat too soon after heating, while the sides and\r\n        bottom are still hot, causes curd to stick to sides and bottom\r\n        of the vat making cutting difficult.\r\n  (4) Sloshing after the milk begins to thicken breaks the curd and\r\n        causes it to whey off.\r\n\r\n+98. The curdling period.+--The time allowed for rennet action also\r\naffects the texture of the curd. The enzymes of rennet (rennin and\r\npepsin) do not cease acting with the thickening of the milk. In many\r\ncheeses, the handling process begins as soon as the curd has become\r\nsolid enough to split cleanly before a finger thrust into it. If let\r\nstand further, the same curd mass will continue to harden with the\r\nprogressive separation of whey; this shows first as drops (\"sweating\")\r\non its surface, which then increase in number and size until they run\r\ntogether and form a sheet of whey. The limit of such action is difficult\r\nto measure. The solidifying process ceases in a period of hours. The\r\nfurther action of the enzymes is digestive in character and goes on\r\nslowly. It requires a period of weeks or even months to accomplish\r\nmeasurable results at the working temperatures in use in the trade.\r\nOther ripening agents with more rapid action intervene to shape the\r\nfinal result. It follows that the rennet factor in the ripening changes\r\nfound at the end of the period is almost negligible for most varieties\r\nof cheese, although it appears to be measurable in some varieties.\r\n\r\n+99. Cutting or breaking[30] the curd.+--As soon as curd is formed,\r\nseparation of whey begins upon the surface and perhaps around the sides\r\nof the vessel. This is accompanied by shrinkage and hardening of the\r\nmass. If the curd remains unbroken, the separation is extremely slow. In\r\ncheese-making practice, such curd masses may be dipped at once into\r\nhoops as in Camembert, dumped in mass into cloths for drainage as in\r\nNeufchâtel or, as in the larger number of cheeses, cut or broken in some\r\ncharacteristic manner. After the curd mass is firm, the rate at which\r\nsubsequent changes take place depends largely on the size of the\r\nparticles into which the curd is cut. The smaller the particles, the\r\nquicker the water is expelled. Consequently the development of the\r\nacidity and other changes take place more slowly. For this reason the\r\ncurd should be cut into pieces of uniform size. If the work is not\r\nproperly performed, the pieces of curd of various sizes will be at\r\ndifferent stages of development. The fine particles will be firm and\r\nelastic while the larger particles are still soft and full of whey and\r\nmay be developing too much acid. The knives should be inserted into the\r\ncurd obliquely so that they will cut their way into the curd and not\r\nbreak it. The horizontal knife is used lengthwise of the vat and cuts\r\nthe curd into layers of uniform thickness. The perpendicular knife then\r\nis used lengthwise and crosswise of the vat. It first cuts the curd\r\ninto strips and then into cubes. The knives may have wire blades or\r\nsteel blades, some operators preferring one and some the other.\r\nWhichever is used, the blades should be close enough together to give\r\nthe fineness of curd desired.\r\n\r\nAfter the knife passes through, the cut faces quickly become covered\r\nwith a smooth coating, continuous over all exposed areas. This surface\r\nhas the appearance of a smooth elastic coating or film. This can be seen\r\nby carefully breaking a piece in the hand. It is this film which holds\r\nthe fat within the pieces of curd. If the film is broken, some of the\r\nfat globules are lost because the rennet extract acts only on the casein\r\nand that in turn holds the fat. All the fat globules which come in\r\ncontact with the knives as they pass through the curd will be left\r\nbetween the pieces of curd and will pass off in the whey. If care is\r\nexercised in cutting, the loss of fat will be confined to what may be\r\ncalled a mechanical loss. This is similar to the loss of the sawdust\r\nwhen sawing a board. This loss in American Cheddar is about 0.3 per cent\r\nand cannot be avoided. If it is greater than this, it is due to\r\nnegligence on the part of the cheese-maker or the poor condition of the\r\nmilk. The cutting of the curd into small pieces may be considered a\r\nnecessary evil. If the moisture could be expelled from the whole mass\r\nwithout disturbing it, this fat loss could be prevented. The cutting,\r\nbreaking or turning should be done with the greatest care, that the loss\r\nmay be as small as possible.\r\n\r\n+100. Curd knives.+--For cutting curd, special knives have been devised\r\n(Fig. 11). They consist of series of parallel blades fixed in a frame to\r\nmake cuts equidistant. The blades run vertically in one, horizontally\r\nin another. They are spaced according to the demands of the variety of\r\ncheese to be made. Wires stretched in a frame take the place of blades\r\nin some makes of curd knife.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 11.--Blade and wire curd knives: horizontal,\r\nperpendicular, horizontal, perpendicular.]\r\n\r\n+101. Heating or \"cooking.\"+--Curdling by rennet has already been shown\r\nto be markedly hastened by moderate heating. After the coagulum or curd\r\nis formed, the making process may be completed without the application\r\nof further heat, as in Neufchâtel, Camembert and related forms (Fig. 12)\r\nand in some practices with Limburger. In other forms and especially in\r\nthe hard cheeses in which cutting of curd is a prominent part of the\r\nprocess, the curd after being cut is reheated or \"cooked.\" The cooking\r\nprocess hastens the removal of the whey, thus shortening the time\r\nrequired to reduce the water-content of the mass to the percentage most\r\nfavorable for the type of cheese desired. The process also produces\r\nmarked changes in the physical character of the curd mass. With the rise\r\nin temperature the casein becomes elastic first, then approaches a\r\nmelting condition and assumes a tough, almost rubbery consistency. The\r\nfinal texture is the result of the combination of the amount of rennet\r\nadded, the temperature, the acidity reached during the process, and the\r\nfinal water-content of the mass.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 12.--The heat relation. See pages 77 and 87.]\r\n\r\n+102. Draining+ (including grinding, putting into hoops or forms and\r\npressing).--The reduction of the water in the curd begins almost as soon\r\nas the curd becomes firm. It is aided by cutting or breaking, by the\r\nretention of the heat applied before renneting and by the secondary\r\nheating or cooking used in making certain groups of cheeses. In many\r\nvarieties special apparatus is provided in the form of draining boards,\r\ndraining racks or bags to hasten the removal of the whey as fast as it\r\nseparates. The draining process continues until the cheese has reached\r\nits final form and weight. The intervening process of matting in the\r\nCheddar group involves a combination of a souring process with the\r\nremoval of whey, during which the cubes of curd become fused into\r\nsemi-solid masses. If such masses are formed, they must be ground up\r\nbefore the cheese can be given its final form in the hoop. The draining\r\nprocess, therefore, may take any one of many forms varying from the\r\ndirect transfer of freshly formed curd into hoops in which the entire\r\ndraining process is completed, to an elaborate series of operations\r\nwhich end in pressing curd drained to approximately its final condition\r\nbefore it is placed in the hoop.\r\n\r\n+103. Application to cheese.+--From the discussion of these factors, it\r\nis evident that the cheeses produced will differ widely with the\r\ndifferences in manipulation. If one considers essential constituent\r\nsubstances separately, the water-content of the finished product is\r\nfound to vary from 30 per cent in Parmesan to 75 per cent in cottage\r\ncheese. The fat-content runs from a trace in some varieties to 60 per\r\ncent in some cream cheeses. The texture of the casein, which gives\r\ncharacter to the product, varies from the tough or glue-like consistency\r\nof freshly made Swiss to the buttery condition of a cream or Neufchâtel\r\ncheese. Inside such limits the tastes of different peoples have led to\r\nthe manufacture of many kinds of cheese. Each of these varieties\r\nrepresents some particular combination of curd-making factors and\r\nripening conditions which produces a cheese suited to the taste of the\r\nmaker and consumer of that country or community.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\n_CLASSIFICATION_\r\n\r\n\r\nThe literature of cheese-making contains reference to more than 500\r\nnames for varieties of cheese. Many of these can be thrown readily into\r\ngreat groups or families in which there are variations in unessential\r\ndetail without modifying the characteristic texture and flavor of the\r\nproduct. Many varietal names are attached to the product of single\r\nfactories or factory groups. Such varieties frequently differ only\r\nslightly in size or shape, or in stage of drainage or of ripening, from\r\nwidely known varieties or other similar local forms. The descriptions\r\nrecorded for such varieties commonly emphasize minor differences in\r\nmanipulation without showing differences in essential factors. Vessels\r\nof particular size are prescribed to be made of wood, earthenware, or of\r\na special metal. These details specify the exact size and shape of\r\nhoops, the use of particular styles of cutting or breaking instruments\r\nand of certain stirring tools, the material and construction of mats and\r\ndraining racks.\r\n\r\nThe descriptions themselves are very commonly inadequate. The variable\r\nfactors in cheese-making are fat-content of the milk, acidity,\r\ntemperature of setting, amount of rennet, time allowed for curdling and\r\nthe method of draining the curd. The differences in practice lie, with\r\nfew exceptions, in the amount or intensity of particular factors, not\r\ndifferences in kind or quality of treatment. Such contrasts are\r\nquantitative, not qualitative. A great number of combinations is\r\npossible by small variations of these factors.\r\n\r\nVarieties selected as types of groups give marked contrasts in\r\ncharacter, but comparison of large numbers of forms shows that almost\r\nevery gradation from group to group can actually be found. Within groups\r\nfrequently the same physical results in texture and flavor can be\r\nobtained by combinations or adjustments of factors for the purpose of\r\noffsetting or counteracting the effects of one change in practice by the\r\nmanipulation of other factors. In ripening, an equally large range of\r\npractices makes possible the development of very different qualities in\r\nmature cheeses from the same lot.\r\n\r\nOnly a few of the large number of described varieties have obtained even\r\nnational importance; fewer still are known outside the country of\r\norigin. In spite of the success of special products when properly\r\nadvertised, the largest place in the market is clearly accorded to the\r\nstandard forms which are widely known.\r\n\r\n+104. Basis of classification.+--A series of these widely known forms\r\nhas been chosen as typical of groups in a system of classification\r\nadapted from the French of Pouriau. No completely satisfactory scheme of\r\nclassifying all of these varieties has been devised. The grouping\r\nproposed here is based on the principles of curd-making already\r\ndiscussed together with consideration of the ripening processes to be\r\ndiscussed with each group. The factors that actually influence the\r\nquality of the final product are separated as completely as possible\r\nfrom non-essential operative details.\r\n\r\nThe common use of the terms \"soft\" and \"hard\" cheese is based on the\r\nsingle arbitrary fact of texture. The term \"semi-hard\" cheese may be\r\nconveniently applied to a miscellaneous group of unrelated families\r\nwhich are intermediate in texture between such soft forms as Neufchâtel\r\nor Camembert and really hard cheeses like Cheddar or Parmesan. Although\r\nthese terms are not made the main basis of the proposed grouping, their\r\napplication to sections is indicated. Classification based on the\r\nessential facts of manufacture is, however, really helpful.\r\n\r\n\r\n  ANALYTICAL TABULATION OF GROUPS\r\n\r\n  Section I.

It does not consider all varieties and\r\nspecialties. Some of these groups are important enough to demand special\r\nmention.\r\n\r\n+105. Processed cheeses.+--Cheese of any group may be run through mixing\r\nand molding machines and repackaged in very different form from that\r\ncharacteristic of the variety. In such treatment, the texture and\r\nappearance may be so changed as to give the effect of a new product.\r\nSubstances (such as pimiento) are added to change the flavor. Or the\r\nproduct may be canned and sterilized with equally great change of\r\nflavor and texture. One thus finds Club made from Cheddar; Pimiento\r\nfrom Cream, Neufchâtel or Cheddar; similarly olive, nut and other\r\ncombinations are made. The possible variations are numerous.\r\n\r\n+106. Whey cheeses.+--Several products bearing cheese names are made\r\nfrom whey. These take the forms of the recovery of the albumin and\r\ncasein separately or in a single product, and the recovery of the\r\nmilk-sugar either alone or with the albumin. Whey cheeses have been\r\nespecially developed by the Scandinavian people, although some of them\r\nhave their origin in the south of Europe. Certain of these varieties are\r\nproduced on a limited scale in America.\r\n\r\nThere are a number of forms fairly widely known that are difficult to\r\nplace in this scheme of groups. Among these are Caciocavallo, Sap Sago.\r\n\r\n+107. Soft and hard cheeses.+--Another commonly used classification\r\nmakes two groups: (1) soft cheeses; (2) hard cheeses. In such a\r\nclassification the semi-hard group presented here is included with the\r\nsoft cheeses. Some cheeses of this group are soft in texture. This is\r\ncorrelated with high water-content, high fat-content or both together.\r\n\r\n+108. Relation of moisture to classes.+--In this classification the\r\nwater-content reflected in the texture of the cheese assumes first\r\nplace. To carry the analysis somewhat further by showing the correlation\r\nbetween water-content and certain factors, a tabulation of well-known\r\nvarieties of typical groups is presented (Table III). In this table the\r\nseries of typical dairy products are first arranged according to\r\nwater-content of the final product. Approximate limits of percentages of\r\nmilk-fat are also given, because milk-fat frequently affects texture to\r\na degree almost equal to water. Column 4 gives the period within which\r\nthe more quickly perishable cheeses are usable, and the length of the\r\nripening for the more solid forms. The correlation between\r\nwater-content, texture and the time of keeping is clearly shown for most\r\nvarieties.\r\n\r\n  TABLE III\r\n\r\n  CORRELATION WATER- AND FAT-CONTENT WITH RIPENING\r\n\r\n  ------------------+--------+--------+-------------+--------------\r\n                    |  PER   |  PER   |             |\r\n       VARITY OF    |  CENT  |  CENT  |   PERIOD    |  RIPENING\r\n                    |  WATER |  FAT   |  REQUIRED   |   AGENT\r\n  ------------------+--------+--------+-------------+--------------\r\n  Cheese: Soft,     |        |        |             |\r\n    Cottage         |    70  | trace  | a few days  | Bacteria\r\n    Skim Neufchâtel |    70  | trace  | a few days  | Bacteria\r\n    Neufchâtel      | 50-60  | 12-28  | a few days  | Bacteria\r\n    Camembert       |    50  | 22-30  | 3-5 weeks   | Molds\r\n    Cream cheese    | 40-50  | 35-45  | a few days  | Primarily\r\n                    |        |        |             |   bacteria\r\n                    |        |        |             |\r\n      Semi-hard:    |        |        |             |\r\n    Limburger       | 40-45  | 24-30  | 3-6 months  | Bacteria\r\n    Roquefort       | 38-40  | 31-34  | 3-6 months  | Mold\r\n    Brick           | 37-42  | 31-35  | 3-6 months  | Bacteria\r\n                    |        |        |             |\r\n      Hard:         |        |        |             |\r\n    Cheddar         | 30-39  | 32-36  | 6-12 months | Bacteria\r\n    Swiss           | 31-34  | 28-31  | 9-18 months | Bacteria\r\n                    |        |        |             |  and yeasts\r\n    Parmesan        | 30-33  |        | 2-3 years   | Bacteria\r\n  ------------------+--------+--------+-------------+--------------\r\n\r\nThe soft cheeses are quickly perishable products. Bacteria and molds\r\nfind favorable conditions for growth in products with 45 to 75 per cent\r\nof water. If such growth is permitted, enzymic activities follow quickly\r\nwith resultant changes in appearance, texture, odor and taste.\r\nRefrigeration is necessary to transport such cheeses to the consumer,\r\nif properly ripened. Trade in these forms may continue throughout the\r\nyear in cool climates and in places where adequate refrigeration is\r\navailable. Practically, however, outside the large cities this trade in\r\nAmerica is at present limited to the cold months; inside the large\r\ncities much reduced quantities of these cheeses continue to be handled\r\nthrough the year.\r\n\r\nIn the stricter sense, the soft group of cheeses falls naturally into\r\ntwo series: (1) the varieties eaten fresh; and (2) the ripened soft\r\ncheeses. Those eaten fresh have a making process which commonly involves\r\nthe development of a lactic acid flavor by souring, but no ripening is\r\ncontemplated after the product leaves the maker's hands. In the ripened\r\nseries, after the making process is completed, the essential flavors and\r\ntextures are developed by the activity of micro-organisms during\r\nripening periods varying in length but fairly well-defined for each\r\nvariety.\r\n\r\nIn contrast to the soft cheeses, the hard kinds are low in\r\nwater-content, ripen more slowly and may be kept through much longer\r\nperiods. They retain their form through a wider range of climatic\r\nconditions. They develop flavor slowly and correspondingly deteriorate\r\nmuch more slowly. Such cheeses are in marketable condition over longer\r\nperiods. In their manufacture the cooking of the curd takes a prominent\r\nplace.\r\n\r\n+109. Relation of heat to classes.+--The close relation between the heat\r\napplied and the product sought forms the basis of a striking series of\r\ngraphs (Fig. 12, page 78). These show the changes hour by hour in the\r\nheat relation during the making process of a series of widely known\r\nforms, each of which is chosen as typical. In some of these forms, heat\r\nis applied but once to bring the milk to the renneting temperature\r\ntypical for the variety. Subsequent manipulations are accompanied by a\r\nsteady fall in temperature. In other forms, the curd when solid is\r\nspecially heated or \"cooked\" to bring about the changes characteristic\r\nof the variety. These contrasts are clearly brought out by the graphs\r\nwhich represent practices well recognized for the varieties. The\r\ndetailed process for these groups is considered in succeeding chapters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nCHEESES WITH SOUR-MILK FLAVOR\r\n\r\n\r\nThe cheeses with flavor of sour milk are probably more widely used than\r\nany other group. Historically and to a very large degree at present,\r\nthey are farm cheeses.[31] No estimate of volume of such production in\r\nthe household has ever been made. The utilization of surplus milk in\r\nthis way is of ancient origin.\r\n\r\nWith the introduction of the factory system of handling milk, the\r\nmanufacture of such cheese in the household was largely dropped. The\r\nrise in price of all food substances and increasing appreciation of the\r\nfood value of milk products have made the recovery of all surplus milk\r\nin some form very necessary. The manufacture of cottage, Neufchâtel and\r\ncream cheese is one of the best forms of such recovery which may be\r\nadapted to utilize any grade from skimmed-milk to cream. Large\r\nquantities of skimmed-milk have frequently been lost from the total of\r\nhuman food by the manufacture of casein for industrial uses, and by use\r\nas stock feed.\r\n\r\n+110. Skim series.+--The kinds of cheeses eaten fresh have in common a\r\nvery soft texture and the flavor of sour milk, principally lactic acid.\r\nThe group falls naturally into two sections: (1) the cheeses made from\r\nmilk curdled by souring; (2) those for which the milk is curdled by\r\nsouring and rennet. In the latter group both agencies are necessary to\r\nthe resulting product. The time required to curdle by souring alone is\r\nlonger than when rennet is used; this period is usually longer than\r\nnecessary for the cream to rise by gravity; hence the cream is either\r\nskimmed off or removed with the separator beforehand. The curd,\r\ntherefore, is essentially a skimmed-milk curd. Casein curdled in this\r\nway tends to become granular or \"rough,\" to feel \"sandy\" when rubbed\r\nbetween the fingers. Heating is commonly necessary to lower the\r\nwater-content of the mass even to 75 per cent. Such curd tends to become\r\nhard or rubbery when heat is applied. In this group, the best known form\r\nis variously called \"cottage\" cheese, \"clabber\" cheese, schmierkäse.\r\n\r\n+111. Cottage cheese+ is made from skimmed-milk, soured by lactic\r\nbacteria until a curd is formed. This is done preferably at about 20° C.\r\n(70° F.), because at this temperature the purely lactic type of organism\r\nhas been found to outgrow competing forms which may be present. Starter\r\ncontaining the desired culture, if properly used, saves much time in the\r\ncurdling period. Such curdling requires at least twelve to twenty-four\r\nhours, frequently much longer unless abundant starter is introduced.\r\n\r\n+112. Household practice.+--The details of cottage cheese making in the\r\nhome differ widely in separate sections and even in different families\r\nin the same part of the country. The essentials of the practice, common\r\nto all, include: (1) curdling the whole milk by natural souring; (2)\r\nremoving the sour cream which is usually used for butter-making; (3)\r\nscalding the curdled skimmed-milk either by slowly heating it in the\r\noriginal vessel surrounded by hot water or by actually pouring an\r\napproximately equal volume of boiling water into the curdled mass; (4)\r\nbagging and draining the mass until it reaches the desired texture; (5)\r\nthe kneading of the mass with the addition of salt and cream. The\r\nresulting product varies greatly in quality. Unfavorable fermentations\r\nfrequently affect the flavor.[32] The \"scalding\" varies from a\r\ntemperature of 90° F. almost to boiling with a resultant texture varying\r\nfrom almost the smooth buttery consistency of Neufchâtel to hard coarse\r\ngranular lumps. The best practice, using clean well-cared-for milk and\r\ndraining at low temperature, produces a very attractive cheese. Such\r\ncheese is heated to 90° to 100° F. on the maker's judgment, drained\r\ncarefully, kneaded well by hand or by machine with the addition of cream\r\nto give it an attractive texture and flavor.\r\n\r\n+113. Factory practice.+--When cottage cheese is made in the\r\nfactory,[33] separated milk is taken; it should be pasteurized and then\r\nsoured by a lactic starter. The souring can be accelerated by the use of\r\na starter, which may be added at the rate of 0.5 to 5 per cent of the\r\nskimmed-milk used, depending on the amount of starter that can be made.\r\nGenerally, the more starter added, the more rapid will be the\r\ncoagulation and the better will be the flavor of the cheese. As soon as\r\nthe milk has thickened, the curd is ready to be broken up and separated\r\nfrom the whey. This separation is hastened by the application of heat.\r\nUsually the temperature of the curd is raised slightly before it is\r\nbroken up; since this makes the curd firmer, there will be a smaller\r\nloss of curd particles in the whey. The curd may be cut with coarse\r\nCheddar cheese knives or broken with a rake. The temperature of the curd\r\nshould be raised very slowly, at least thirty minutes being taken to\r\nreach the desired final temperature. No set rule can be given as to the\r\nexact temperature to which the curd should be heated. The temperature\r\nshould be raised until a point is reached at which the curd, when\r\npressed between the thumb and the fingers, will stick together and not\r\ngo back to the milky state. This temperature is usually from 94° to 100°\r\nF., but the cheese-maker must use his own judgment in this respect. If\r\nthe curd is heated too much, it will be hard and dry; on the other hand,\r\nif it is not heated sufficiently, the whey will not separate from the\r\ncurd and the latter will be very soft and mushy.\r\n\r\nWhen the curd has been heated sufficiently and has become firmed in the\r\nwhey, it should be removed from the whey. This may be done either by\r\nletting down one end of the vat and piling the curd in the upper end, or\r\nby dipping out the curd into a cloth bag and allowing the whey to drain,\r\nwhich it does very rapidly. No treatment can prevent the \"roughness\" of\r\nan acid curd (this is a fine gritty feeling when rubbed between the\r\nfingers), but the coarse hard grainy texture and lumps characteristic of\r\nthe highly heated curd do not develop. Experimental workers have agreed\r\nthat to have the proper texture, such curd should contain when finished\r\nabout 70 to 75 per cent of water. It should have a mild but clean acid\r\nflavor. Such a cheese will carry about 1 to 2 per cent of salt, without\r\nan objectionably salty taste. This cheese is commonly sold by measure,\r\nsometimes in molds or cartons. The manufacture of all forms of cottage\r\ncheese has been largely superseded by the making of skimmed-milk\r\nNeufchâtel or Baker's cheese.\r\n\r\nThe yield from one hundred pounds of skimmed-milk runs up to fourteen to\r\nnineteen pounds of cheese, when made very wet or from pasteurized milk.\r\nThe yield varies with the moisture-content of the cheese, being greater\r\nfor cheese with a high content. Too much moisture or whey should not be\r\nleft in the curd, however, as this will render it too soft to be\r\nhandled.\r\n\r\nCottage cheese made by either the home or factory practice is a quickly\r\nperishable article. Although the acid restrains bacteria at first, the\r\nhigh percentage of water favors the growth of molds which tolerate\r\nacidity, especially _Oidium (Oospora) lactis_ and the Mucors or black\r\nmolds. These molds destroy acidity rapidly and thus permit the bacteria\r\nof decay to develop and to produce objectionable taste and odors.\r\nSpoilage in these products is accelerated by the kneading process which\r\ndistributes air throughout the mass and with it all forms of microbial\r\ncontamination.\r\n\r\n+114. Buttermilk cheese.+--A cheese closely resembling cottage may be\r\nmade from buttermilk. If the buttermilk came from cream which was\r\nchurned before it became sour, the process is the same as that already\r\ndescribed for the making of cottage cheese from skimmed-milk. If the\r\nbuttermilk came from sour cream the process of manufacture is much more\r\ndifficult. The casein of sour cream has already been coagulated with\r\nacid and broken during churning into very minute rather hard particles.\r\nThese fine particles are difficult to recover. They are so fine that\r\nthey pass through the draining cloth or at other times clog it and\r\nprevent drainage. They do not stick together at ordinary temperatures.\r\nThey cannot be collected by the use of acid because they have already\r\nbeen coagulated with acid. After casein has been coagulated with acid,\r\nrennet extract will not recoagulate the particles. The buttermilk may be\r\nmixed with sweet skimmed-milk; then as the latter coagulates, it locks\r\nin the casein of the buttermilk so that it can be collected. If\r\nbuttermilk from soured cream is used alone, the casein may be\r\ncollected[34] by neutralizing and heating to 130 to 150° F., and holding\r\nuntil the casein gathers together. The whey can then be drawn off. Often\r\nthere is further difficulty in getting the casein to collect, since the\r\npieces remain so small that they go through the strainer.\r\n\r\nCheese made entirely from buttermilk is sandy in texture and often not\r\npalatable. If the buttermilk with good flavor is mixed with\r\nskimmed-milk, it makes a good cheese closely resembling cottage.\r\n\r\n+115. Neufchâtel group.+[35]--The Neufchâtel process originated in\r\nnorthern France where a number of varieties are included under this as a\r\ngroup name. Among these are Bondon, Malakoff, Petit Suisse, Petit Carré.\r\nThe name designates a general process of curd-making which is applied to\r\nskimmed-milk, whole milk or cream. Some of the resultant cheeses are\r\nripened; some are eaten fresh. The Neufchâtel cheeses of France gained\r\nsuch wide recognition for quality that the process of making has become\r\nwidely known. In America the manipulations of the French process were\r\nearly dropped. The essentials were made the basis of a successful\r\nfactory practice which has been widely adopted. The American factory\r\npractice is discussed here and the French process briefly considered\r\nunder the heading Ripened Neufchâtel. (See Chapter VIII.)\r\n\r\n+116. Domestic or American Neufchâtel cheeses+ are soft, have clean sour\r\nmilk (lactic acid) flavor and are quickly perishable. In all but the\r\ncoldest weather, they require refrigeration to reduce deterioration and\r\nloss. They range in fat-content from traces only to 50 per cent and\r\nmore; in water from 40 to 75 per cent, according to the milk used. In\r\ntexture Neufchâtel is smooth, free from gas, free from lumps or\r\nroughness when rubbed between the fingers. This flavor and texture is\r\nobtained by a combination of slow rennet curdling with developing\r\nacidity. No further ripening is permitted.\r\n\r\n+117. The factory.+--Neufchâtel factories require the standard dairy\r\nequipment for receiving, weighing, testing, separating, heating,\r\npasteurizing and cooling the milk. Since many factories produce several\r\nproducts, the same general dairy equipment may serve for all. In\r\naddition to such equipment, Neufchâtel requires a curdling apparatus\r\nwhich can be held at 70-75° F. This may be a room properly controlled,\r\nor a tank where temperature control is obtained by water and steam. For\r\ndraining, a room kept at 60° F. gives nearly the ideal temperature,\r\nwhich must be supplemented by relative humidity high enough to prevent\r\nthe exposed surface of curd from drying during periods of twelve to\r\ntwenty-four hours. This requires almost a saturated atmosphere. A room\r\nwith special molding machinery is required and tables for wrapping,\r\nlabeling and boxing the product are necessary. Box-making machinery is\r\nusually an economic necessity for work on a large scale. Adequate\r\nrefrigeration is requisite both to chill the curd before molding and to\r\npreserve it after packaging.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 13.--Neufchâtel draining racks.]\r\n\r\n+118. Cans.+--For curdling, the \"shot-gun\" can, about nine inches in\r\ndiameter and twenty inches deep, is generally used. This holds thirty to\r\nforty pounds of milk. Increased capacity is dependent, therefore, on the\r\nnumber of units installed, not on changes in the units themselves.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 14.--Detail of a Neufchâtel draining rack.]\r\n\r\n+119. Draining racks.+--A draining rack is required for each can of\r\ncurd. These racks also are standardized units whose number limits the\r\ncapacity of the factory. The design of these racks (Figs. 13, 14) and\r\ntheir arrangement in the draining room are taken from Bulletin 78 of the\r\nStorrs Agricultural Experiment Station: \"The racks are rectangular,\r\nthirteen inches wide, thirty-six inches long and ten inches deep. The\r\ncorner posts extend one and one-half inches beyond the strips at top and\r\nbottom with the tops rounded as a rule as seen in the photograph. The\r\nbottom slats fit loosely into notches, hence are removable for washing\r\npurposes. The materials required are four corner posts one and one-half\r\nby one and one-half inches; nine strips one by three-eighths by\r\nthirty-six inches; six strips one by three-eighths by thirteen inches,\r\ntwo strips one by three-eighths by twelve and a quarter inches, notched\r\nto receive the bottom slats; all made from pine.\"\r\n\r\n+120. Cloths.+--For each draining rack, a cloth one yard wide and one\r\nand one-half yards long is required. Cotton sheeting is satisfactory for\r\nthe purpose; \"even-count, round-thread, unmercerized voile\" is suggested\r\nby Dahlberg.[36]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 15.--Neufchâtel and cream cheese molds.]\r\n\r\n+121. Molding machinery.+--For work on a large scale, special power\r\nmachines[37] are regularly used. These consist of a hopper and worm\r\ndelivering a standard size stream of curd through a proper size and\r\nshape of delivery tube. This curd stream is cut by an automatic device\r\ninto the proper lengths to form the standard cheese. In this way a\r\nuniform size of cheeses is obtained. Experimental work with hand\r\napparatus showed that a worm six inches in diameter is required to\r\ndeliver curd in a smooth column one and one-half inches square. If the\r\npressure is not sufficient, the column will frill at the edges. Such\r\nirregular surfaces cannot be wrapped smoothly enough to delay spoilage.\r\n\r\nOn a small scale, a fair grade of product can be molded through a tin\r\ntube (see Fig. 15) one and three-quarters inches in diameter and ten\r\ninches long in which the curd is compressed by a close fitting plunger\r\noperated by hand.\r\n\r\n+122. Milk for Neufchâtel+ should be clean, free from gas and taint.\r\nSuch milk should preferably be not more than twelve hours old when\r\nreceived and in no case show higher than 0.20 per cent lactic acid by\r\ntitration. Milk testing 4 per cent fat or higher will produce a higher\r\nquality of product than lower grade milk, although every grade from\r\nskimmed-milk to cream is used in producing some form of Neufchâtel. This\r\nmilk should be pasteurized unless shown to be free from tuberculosis by\r\nproper test of the cattle. Evidence[38] that the organism of\r\ntuberculosis will withstand the regular handling process for cheeses of\r\nthis group and retain its ability to cause disease in experimental\r\nanimals makes the introduction of pasteurization necessary in this whole\r\ngroup of cheeses. Any effective pasteurization may be used, but\r\ntemperatures of 140-145° F. for thirty minutes have been effective with\r\nless changes in the milk than higher temperatures for shorter periods.\r\nThe milk should be cooled to curdling temperature and the starter and\r\nrennet added and stirred into the milk in bulk. The milk may then be\r\nquickly distributed into the curdling cans with a hose or from the gate\r\nvalve of the mixing vat.\r\n\r\n+123. Starter.+--To insure the development of a clean acid flavor, a\r\nsmall amount of lactic starter should be used. The quantity to use\r\ndepends on the quality of the milk. With skimmed-milk, a pint for each\r\nthirty-pound can is recommended by Matheson and Cammack[39] and by\r\nDahlberg. (See page 98.) For whole-milk Neufchâtel, 2 c.c. to a\r\nthirty-pound can of milk commonly gives good results. On this basis 2\r\nounces of starter would be sufficient if properly stirred into about\r\n1000 pounds of milk. Too slow development of acid is preferable to\r\nover-rapid souring.\r\n\r\n+124. Renneting or setting.+--The milk should be cooled after\r\npasteurizing to between 70° and 75° F. Rennet is added at the rate of\r\n1/3 c.c. to a thirty-pound can (roughly 1/3 ounce to 1000 pounds). This\r\nwill thicken the milk sufficiently in the first few hours to reduce the\r\nseparation of the cream. For completion of the curdling and souring\r\nprocess, twelve to eighteen hours are required. Usually the cans stand\r\novernight at uniform temperature. When ready to drain, the curd should\r\nbe firm, smooth and mildly acid. Whey separating from it should not\r\ntitrate above 0.35 per cent titrated as lactic acid.\r\n\r\n+125. Draining.+--A cloth is spread over a draining rack and the\r\ncontents of one \"shot-gun\" can poured upon the cloth with as little\r\nbreaking as possible. In this way a large surface is exposed. The room\r\nmust be kept wet to prevent the surface of the curd drying to form\r\ncrusts which stop draining. A temperature of 60° F. is favorable to the\r\nmaintenance of proper texture and humidity without the development of\r\nobjectionable organisms, especially _Oidium lactis_, which tends to\r\ncover every exposed surface in such rooms. Draining may be hastened by\r\nturning the curd or changing the position of the cloth. In factory\r\npractice, the large draining surface reduces the necessity of handling\r\nthe curd and reduces the loss of fat. About twelve hours are required\r\nupon the draining racks.\r\n\r\nOn a small scale with a few cans of curd in the home, any form of\r\ndraining rack may be used, such as a potato or berry crate, or the\r\ncorners of the cloth may be brought together, tied and the mass hung up.\r\nThe curd must be turned by pulling up the corners of the cloth to\r\nprevent drying at the edges and stoppage of draining from the center of\r\nthe mass. Such treatment produces much more rapid drainage than the\r\nfactory practice and involves proportionately more labor and larger fat\r\nlosses.\r\n\r\n+126. Cooling Neufchâtel.+--When whey ceases to separate readily, the\r\ncorners of the cloth are loosed from the rack, folded diagonally or\r\ntied, and the curd cooled on ice or in refrigerators. When thoroughly\r\nchilled the bags of curd are put into presses, where light but\r\nincreasing pressure forces more whey out of the mass. Tests at this time\r\nshould show about 0.60 per cent acid in the whey. With low-fat curd\r\nevery step of the process may be hastened, but with high-fat care must\r\nbe exercised to prevent loss of fat during pressing especially. Any\r\npressing device permitting continuous pressure with ease of manipulation\r\nmay be used.\r\n\r\n+127. Pressing.+--The ideals of the maker must determine the extent of\r\npressing. A high yield is obtained by leaving whey in the curd. If\r\nimmediate consumption is certain, such cheese may be satisfactory, but\r\nif the cheese is to be held some days the extra whey carrying more\r\nmilk-sugar favors increased acid development. This produces very sour\r\ncheese with much more danger of other fermentations which cause\r\nobjectionable flavor. Too much water favors more active bacterial growth\r\nas well as produces cheese too soft for the necessary handling in the\r\nmarket.\r\n\r\nIn the press, several bags of curd may be piled together. The press\r\nshould be released and the bags turned from time to time to insure even\r\ndrainage. Several hours of pressing are usually required. The danger of\r\ninsufficient pressing is due to the difference of texture between the\r\nworked and unworked curd. Before working, curd carrying 10 per cent\r\nexcess moisture resembles the finished product sufficiently to deceive\r\nany but the experienced maker. But if this curd is transferred to the\r\nworker and to the molding machine, it is found to become soft, pasty and\r\nsticky, to lack \"body,\" hence to make very unsatisfactory packages and\r\nto spoil very quickly. The masses of curd should come out of the press\r\nas dry and hard flat cakes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 16.--Working Neufchâtel.]\r\n\r\n+128. Working and salting Neufchâtel.+--The cakes of curd go from the\r\npress to the working table. Here they are broken by hand or by a\r\nbutter-worker or kneading machine (Fig. 16). Salt at the rate of one\r\nand one-half pounds to 100 pounds of curd is added. If the curd is not\r\nsufficiently pressed, the masses become mushy or pasty during the\r\nworking process. The working is continued until the whole mass is\r\nuniformly smooth and buttery.\r\n\r\n+129. Storage.+--The draining and working processes permit the\r\ncontamination of the curd with organisms from the air and from the\r\napparatus. These are distributed throughout the mass. Air is also worked\r\nthoroughly into the curd. Such a product spoils quickly. Distributing\r\nhouses find the Neufchâtel trade uncertain in volume from day to day,\r\nhence many of them store the cheese in bulk and package only fast enough\r\nto fill orders. This minimizes the loss due to spoilage. Such curd may\r\nbe packed into tubs and kept for considerable time in cold storage. If\r\nmolded for the retail trade, it is more quickly perishable. When packed\r\nsolidly in mass, curd is largely protected from spoilage by the\r\nexclusion of air and perhaps the quick exhaustion of free oxygen through\r\nthe respiration of the micro-organisms present and by its acidity. This\r\nmust be supplemented by low temperature to reduce the loss to a minimum.\r\nEven when spoilage begins, it is easily confined to the slight growth of\r\n_Oidium lactis_ or green mold and bacteria on exposed areas. These can\r\nbe removed with minimum loss and damage to the mass. On the other hand,\r\nsuch curd molded into the commercial package of 3 to 6 ounces and\r\nwrapped in paper, with tin-foil or carton for protection, still presents\r\nenormously increased surface for the growth of aerobic forms--especially\r\n_Oidium lactis_, green mold (Roquefort mold is the usual green species)\r\nand accompanying bacteria. Curd in tubs may be kept some days; in\r\ncommercial packages lowering of quality (flavor) begins almost at once.\r\n\r\n+130. Molding.+--When the standard molding machine (Fig. 17) is\r\nprovided, curd is brought directly from the refrigerator to the machine.\r\nIf permitted to become warm, the mass becomes sticky; when cold it is\r\nmore readily handled. The machine is fitted with the special delivery\r\ntube for the variety to be handled, cylindrical for Neufchâtel in its\r\nvarious forms, rectangular in section for cream. Enough workers should\r\nbe provided to wrap and label the cheese without leaving it exposed to\r\ncontamination or heat. Parchment paper and tin-foil cut the proper size\r\nfor each variety and bearing printed labels are readily obtainable. Each\r\ncheese should be wrapped with paper and tin-foil and put directly into a\r\nflat box which holds a standard number (usually 12 or 24) of the special\r\nproduct.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 17.--Molding Neufchâtel.]\r\n\r\nIn working with the hand molding tube (Fig. 15) the same care is\r\nrequired. Chilled curd is forced into a firm smooth mass with the\r\nplunger. It is removed and wrapped when it reaches the regular size of\r\nthe variety.\r\n\r\nAll forms when molded go directly into the boxes and then back to the\r\nrefrigerators until demanded for actual use. The details of the process\r\ndiffer according to the form made.\r\n\r\n+131. Skimmed-milk Neufchâtel.+--Separator skimmed-milk is frequently\r\nmade into curd by the Neufchâtel process. The absence of fat eliminates\r\nthe largest element of loss in manufacture. Each stage of the making\r\nprocess, therefore, may be shortened. The demand that the curd shall be\r\nsmooth and buttery in texture rather than rough or gritty requires the\r\nexercise of care in curdling of milk. The draining and pressing of the\r\ncurd may be accomplished much more rapidly than in the fatty cheeses.\r\nThe final product should differ from cottage cheese in smoother texture,\r\nmilder acidity and, as a rule, cleaner flavor. In composition, the\r\nabsence of fat must be largely compensated by leaving more water in the\r\ncheese. Such a product reaches the market with 65 to 75 per cent of\r\nwater and perhaps 1.25 per cent of salt. Casein forms 20 to 30 per cent\r\nof the mass.\r\n\r\nThese cheeses are very perishable on account of their high\r\nwater-content. The destructive effect of microorganisms both in the\r\ninterior of the cheese and upon its surface is rapid.\r\n\r\nCheeses of this description may be found in the trade as cottage cheese,\r\nNeufchâtel style, and as Neufchâtel made from skimmed-milk; skimmed-milk\r\nNeufchâtel would be a strictly proper labeling.\r\n\r\n+132. Baker's cheese.+--There is considerable market for skimmed-milk\r\ncurd as Baker's cheese. This product is essentially skimmed-milk\r\nNeufchâtel curd, partially drained and sold in bulk. When the bakery is\r\nnear by, the curd is frequently shoveled into milk-cans in very wet\r\ncondition and sent directly from the factory to the bakery. If the\r\ndistance is such as to require considerable time for transportation,\r\nthe same care is frequently given as for Neufchâtel curd packed in bulk\r\nfor storage and transportation.\r\n\r\nGreat variations in practice are found among the makers of this type of\r\nproduct. In some cases low grade skimmed-milk is handled on a large\r\nscale. Curdling is done quickly and little care is given to the details\r\nof flavor and texture in the curd. Working in this manner, two men are\r\nable to make a ton of such curd, and ship it out in milk-cans each day.\r\nThe resulting product, although very deficient in flavor and texture,\r\ngoes into manufactured specialties which conceal its deficiencies if\r\nconsidered as cheese.\r\n\r\n+133. Domestic Neufchâtel.+--The name Neufchâtel, unless limited clearly\r\nby the label, should designate a cheese made from fresh whole milk.\r\nCheeses of this group are produced in a small number of well-equipped\r\nfactories scattered widely through the dairy states of the North and\r\nNortheast. Every factory uses one or more trade names for its product.\r\nThe same product is frequently relabeled by the distributor who uses his\r\nown trade name instead of that of the maker.\r\n\r\nThe usual form of package is cylindrical, about 1¾ inches in diameter\r\nand 2½ inches long, or sometimes rectangular 2½ by 1½ by 1½\r\ninches. The cheese is protected by wrapping in parchment paper closely\r\nsurrounded by tin-foil. These packages vary from 2½ to 4 ounces. In\r\nsome cases screw-topped glass jars are substituted for the tin-foil\r\npackage. They are objectionable, first, because of cost and, second,\r\nbecause they are so commonly associated with less perishable products as\r\nto mislead either dealer or consumer into holding the product for too\r\nlong a time. The paper or tin-foil package can be kept only at\r\nrefrigerator temperature, hence automatically keeps its possessor\r\nreminded of the perishable nature of its contents.\r\n\r\nNeufchâtel of the best quality made from whole milk testing about 4 per\r\ncent fat may be expected to fall within the following limits;[40] many\r\ngrades contain more water than this at the expense of flavor and keeping\r\nquality:\r\n\r\n  Water        50-55    per cent\r\n  Fat          23-28    per cent\r\n  Casein       18-21    per cent\r\n  Salt        0.5-1.25  per cent\r\n          Yield 12-14 lb. per 100 lb. of milk.\r\n\r\n+134. Partially skim Neufchâtel.+--Brands of Neufchâtel made from milk\r\nthat would test every gradation from whole milk to separator\r\nskimmed-milk may be found. The quality of the product varies with the\r\nskill of the maker from brands no better than cottage cheese to products\r\nscarcely distinguishable from the best whole-milk Neufchâtel. Many\r\nfactories that produce more than one quality of Neufchâtel use labels of\r\ndifferent color, different design or both to separate them; for example,\r\nblue labels usually stand for whole milk, red labels represent lower\r\ngrades. Sometimes the difference in material is indicated by a clear cut\r\ngrade mark. Frequently color, a design of label or both are the only\r\ndefinite marks upon the cheese. The consumer unfamiliar with the trade\r\npractice commonly has no means of knowing the quality of the product\r\noffered. Such cheeses vary in water-content from 55 to 70 per cent; in\r\nfat from 10 to 25 per cent; in casein from 18 to 25 per cent.\r\n\r\n+135. Cream cheese.+--The Neufchâtel process is also used to make cream\r\ncheese. The material utilized is commonly what has been called double\r\ncream. This is produced by separating about half of a given volume of\r\nmilk and running the cream into the other half. Usually cream cheese is\r\nmade in the same factory as various grades of Neufchâtel. No material is\r\nlost. In some instances, cream cheese is prepared by working thick cream\r\ninto the Neufchâtel type of curd from practically skimmed-milk. In\r\nworking with high percentages of fat in curd, care must be taken to\r\navoid loss of fat in draining and pressing. The curd is carefully\r\nchilled before pressing to reduce this loss. This may be done under\r\nrefrigeration or upon cracked ice. Otherwise the manipulations of the\r\nprocess are unchanged. The cheeses are commonly molded in the Neufchâtel\r\nmachine into square cakes weighing about 4 ounces and measuring\r\napproximately 3 by 2¼ by 7/8 inches. These are wrapped in paper and\r\ntin-foil and handled exactly as Neufchâtel.\r\n\r\nCream cheese of high quality made from reënforced milk testing 7 to 9\r\nper cent fat may be expected to test approximately as follows:[41]\r\n\r\n  Water                                      38-43   per cent\r\n  Fat                                        43-48   per cent\r\n  Protein                                    13-16   per cent\r\n  Salt                                      0.5-1.25 per cent\r\n          Yield 16-18 lb. per 100 lb. of cream.\r\n\r\nIncreases of water, hence greater yields, are very common but usually\r\nassociated with loss in quality both as to flavor and texture, and in\r\nmore rapid spoilage; certain brands regularly carry 50 to 60 per cent of\r\nfat but their increased cost of manufacture and sale restricts them to\r\nthe rôle of specialties with closely limited distribution. Trade names\r\nsuch as Philadelphia Cream, Cow Brand, Eagle Brand, Square Cream, Blue\r\nLabel and many other factory brands are on the market.\r\n\r\n+136. Neufchâtel specialties.+--Neufchâtel or cream cheese curd is\r\nfrequently mixed with some flavoring substance, such as pimiento\r\n(pickled Spanish peppers), olives, nuts, spices or other cheeses, such\r\nas Roquefort. These bear appropriate trade names and form a very\r\nattractive addition to our varieties of cheese. Among the names found\r\nare Pimiento, Olive, Nut, and Pim-olive or Olimento.\r\n\r\n+137. Gervais+ is a brand of cream cheese made in Paris and sold widely\r\nin France and even in other continental countries. It occasionally comes\r\nto America. As made in Paris, these cheeses are flat cakes containing\r\napproximately 40 per cent water and 35-45 per cent fat. It clearly\r\ndiffers only in detail from the square cream cheeses made in America.\r\nThe name Gervais is the property of a particular company. Since the\r\ncheese differs in no essential feature from other cream cheeses, this\r\nname should not be applied to a domestic cream brand.\r\n\r\n+138. European forms occasionally imported.+--Among the cheeses related\r\nto Neufchâtel as they reach the market are the \"White\" cheeses of\r\nsouthern Europe. These differ greatly in quality according to their\r\nsource and to their content of cow, sheep, goat's milk or some\r\ncombination of these. This texture and flavor link them with unripened\r\nNeufchâtel. The time required for importation puts a minimum possible\r\nperiod of ten to fifteen days between production and consumption with a\r\nprobable period of at least one month for most samples. As they come to\r\nAmerica, these forms usually show fermentive changes beyond those\r\ntolerated in the domestic product. This may take either of several\r\nforms: (1) intensification of acid flavor with the intensification of\r\nthe characteristic flavors of the particular brand; (2) the development\r\nof old or rancid flavors; (3) the development of Oidium and partial\r\nsoftening of the mass through its agency; (4) the growth of Roquefort\r\nmold and development of the flavor associated with that organism. This\r\nlast form was found in a shipment of Hungarian Briuse which showed about\r\n40 per cent fat, 14 per cent protein and 43 per cent water.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\n_SOFT CHEESES RIPENED BY MOLD_\r\n\r\n\r\nThe ripened soft cheeses include a series of groups of varieties which,\r\nin addition to initial souring, have been subjected to special ripening\r\nprocesses, and which in the ripened condition are soft in texture and\r\nmostly have high flavors. The varieties in each group have in common\r\nsome essential principles of manufacture together with a ripening\r\nprocess dominated by a characteristic group of organisms. In certain\r\ngroups, the ripening is dominated by a yellowish or orange viscid\r\nsurface slime containing _Oidium lactis_ and bacteria; in another\r\nseries, the characteristic organism is a mold of the genus Penicillium\r\n(_P. Camemberti_). Referring to the analysis of groups (page 83), the\r\nripened soft cheeses are found to fall into three well-marked groups,\r\none of which may perhaps be subdivided as indicated. The series curdled\r\nby souring alone begins with approximately cottage cheese curd and\r\ndevelops high flavors by ripening, as in \"hand\" cheese. Ripened\r\nNeufchâtel curdled by souring and rennet together finds its basis in\r\nNeufchâtel curd also but modifies the final product until the familiar\r\nflavor and texture of the unripened form are no longer recognizable.\r\nAmong the forms curdled by rennet alone the Camembert series contains\r\none form, Coulommiers, which is occasionally used unripe, but represents\r\nin general a mold-ripened group of highly flavored forms. The series of\r\nsoft rennet cheeses ripened by bacteria may be broadly designated the\r\nLimburger group.\r\n\r\n+139. Hand cheese and its allies.+--Among skim cheeses, there is a\r\nseries of forms largely German in origin in which curd not far removed\r\nfrom cottage cheese is the basis of the product. Harz cheese is one of\r\nthe best-known of these forms as studied by Eckles and Rahn.[42] One of\r\nthese forms, hand cheese,[43] is manufactured on a commercial basis in\r\nfarm dairies among families of German descent principally in\r\nPennsylvania, and on a factory basis in a few places in New York,\r\nnorthern Illinois and Wisconsin. On the small scale, curd is made by\r\nnatural souring or by use of starter, heated to expel water, cooled and\r\nmolded by hand into cakes two to three inches in diameter and one-half\r\nto three-quarters inch in thickness. The freshly formed cakes are placed\r\nupon a shelf to dry. There they are turned daily until fairly firm, then\r\npacked in rolls into wooden boxes and ripened in a cool damp room. In\r\nthis ripening there is a prompt development of a heavy viscous slime,\r\nwhich consists of Oidium and bacteria. Other molds forming loose cottony\r\nmycelium are brushed off if they appear. The proper consistency of this\r\nslimy covering depends on a close adjustment of water-content in the\r\ncheese with temperature and relative humidity in the ripening room. If\r\nconditions are too dry, the cheeses harden quickly or if less dry they\r\nare attacked by green or blue-green molds. If too wet, the slimy\r\ncovering becomes too soft and watery, or secondarily covered with loose\r\nshimmering masses of mold (Mucor sp.). Ripening should proceed slowly\r\nand occupy a period of six to eight weeks.\r\n\r\n+140. Pennsylvania pot cheese.+--A form of \"pot\" cheese is made in\r\ncertain counties of Pennsylvania, principally for local use. Production\r\nof this cheese on a factory basis is now being attempted. The steps in\r\nmanufacture are about as follows:[44] (1) The home-made type of cottage\r\ncheese curd is prepared, put into a crock or pot and covered carefully;\r\n(2) kept in a warm place (in kitchen usually); (3) stirred from time to\r\ntime, until it has ripened to a semi-liquid condition. This occurs very\r\nrapidly under the attack of _Oidium lactis_ accompanied by bacteria.\r\nWithin a period of three to seven days, according to the temperature and\r\nto the water-content of the mass, the granules of curd become covered\r\nwith a wrinkled gelatinous almost viscid mass of mold mycelium beneath\r\nwhich is a layer of semi-liquid curd with a strong characteristic odor\r\nand taste. This ripened or semi-liquid part reaches about half the total\r\nmass in four or five days at favorable temperatures. (4) The vessel is\r\nthen placed in a larger vessel of water and heated over the fire with\r\nconstant stirring until the whole mass is melted and smooth. (5) Butter\r\nor cream, and salt or other flavor is finally added, stirred in and the\r\nliquid cheese poured into molds or jelly glasses to cool. If properly\r\nmade and cooked, the resultant cheese has a soft buttery consistency\r\nwith an agreeable flavor, which frequently resembles that of Camembert\r\ncheese.\r\n\r\n+141. Appetitost (Appetite cheese).+--A Danish buttermilk cheese is made\r\nunder this name. Sour buttermilk is heated, by some to boiling\r\ntemperature but others (Monrad[45]) prefer 120° F., stirred thoroughly\r\nand allowed to settle. The whey is removed as far as possible. The\r\nsemi-liquid mass is covered and set in a warm place. Fermentation\r\nbecomes active. This tends to make the curd more viscous or sticky. It\r\nis then kneaded and allowed to ferment again. This process is repeated\r\nuntil the mass is yellowish and soft but tough or viscous. When\r\nthoroughly fermented, the mass is again heated to 120° F., and 6 per\r\ncent salt is added together with spice; both are worked in and the\r\ncheese is formed into fancy shapes for sale.\r\n\r\n+142. Ripened Neufchâtel, French process.+--Neufchâtel as a ripened\r\ncheese is made rather widely in France but it is produced on an\r\nespecially large scale in Seine-Inferieure.[46] Some factories use whole\r\nmilk, or milk with added cream, others skimmed-milk.[47] The whole-milk\r\nbrands of Neufchâtel are those which have the widest reputation. For\r\nmaking this cheese, the working room is held as closely as possible at\r\n15-16° C. (58-60° F.). The milk is strained into earthen vessels holding\r\ntwenty liters. Rennet is added to the freshly drawn milk at about 30° C.\r\n(86° F.) in amount sufficient to produce coagulation in about\r\ntwenty-four hours. Draining racks of various forms are covered with\r\ncloth. The vessels of curd are dumped upon the racks. The whey separates\r\nslowly and drains off through the cloth. About twelve hours are allowed\r\nfor this process. The corners of the cloth are then brought together\r\nand folded in or tied and the mass pressed to complete the drainage. The\r\nfinished curd is worked or kneaded to produce a smooth and uniform\r\ntexture. This process of curd-making is essentially the same as the\r\nAmerican factory process of making Neufchâtel. The ripening process has\r\nbeen entirely dropped in America. The curd is finally molded in metal\r\nforms 5 cm. (2 inches) in diameter and about 6.7 cm. (about 3 inches)\r\nhigh, open at both ends. These molds are filled, the freshly formed\r\ncheeses are pressed out with a plunger or piston and their surfaces\r\nsmoothed with a wooden knife.\r\n\r\nAfter molding is completed, the cheeses are salted by sprinkling the\r\nentire surface with fine dry salt as the cheese is held in the hand. In\r\nthis way each cheese receives and absorbs 3 to 4 per cent salt. After\r\nsalting, the cheeses are arranged upon boards and allowed to drain\r\ntwenty-four hours. They are then removed to the first or drying room.\r\nThe frames of the drying room (secherie) are covered with straw and the\r\ncheeses are placed carefully upon the straw to avoid contact with each\r\nother. They are turned each day to present a fresh surface to the straw\r\nduring a period of two to three weeks in the drying room (secherie).\r\nMold begins to show as white cottony mycelium after five to six days,\r\nand slowly turns to \"blue\" (bluish green). When the cheeses are well\r\ncovered with this moldy rind, they are removed to the ripening cellar.\r\nIn the ripening cellar also the cheeses stand upon straw. They are\r\nturned over every three or four days at first, then allowed to stand for\r\na longer period.\r\n\r\nWhen ripe, a Neufchâtel cheese so made weighs about 125 grams. One\r\nliter of milk makes 225 grams of such cheese. The ripening of Neufchâtel\r\nhas never been fully studied, but a series of these cheeses were\r\nobtained by one of the authors; cultures were made and examined.[48] The\r\nsalt-content in the first place was found to be so high that _Oidium\r\nlactis_ was eliminated as an active factor in the ripening. The mold\r\nproved to be on some cheeses _Penicillium Camemberti_, the typical mold\r\nof Camembert as it is made in Normandy, on others _P. Camemberti_ var.\r\n_Rogeri_, the pure white form as used under the patents of M. Georges\r\nRoger in the region of Seine-et-Marne to the eastward of Paris and\r\ncalled by him and by Mazé _P. candidum_. The physical condition of the\r\nripened curd and the flavors encountered were those associated with\r\nthese two species by many hundreds of experiments during the Camembert\r\ninvestigation in Connecticut.[49] These facts justify the conclusion\r\nthat ripened Neufchâtel is first soured by lactic organisms, then so\r\nsalted as to eliminate or reduce to a minimum the characteristic\r\nactivities of _Oidium lactis_, while the proteolytic action and the\r\nphysical changes are closely similar to those of Camembert which is\r\nripened primarily by the same molds.\r\n\r\n+143. The Camembert group.+--The soft cheeses ripened by molds are\r\nFrench in origin. Their manufacture has spread into Germany, Italy and\r\nAmerica. Of the series, the most widely known is Camembert, which will\r\nbe described as typical for the group. Brie, Coulommiers, Robbiola and\r\nRipened Neufchâtel belong to this series.\r\n\r\n+144. Camembert cheese.+--The origin of Camembert is given by French\r\nauthorities as 1791 in the Commune of Camembert near Vimoutiers in Orne,\r\nFrance. From a very restricted production at first, Camembert-making has\r\nspread through the region from Caen in the west to Havre, Rouen and a\r\nconsiderable area east of Paris. In America Camembert began to be made\r\nin one factory about 1900. Several other factories followed by 1906. The\r\ndifficulties and losses encountered led to the abandonment of these\r\nundertakings, until at the outbreak of the European war in 1914 but one\r\nfactory was making Camembert and that only on an experimental scale.\r\nMeanwhile the United States Department of Agriculture and the Storrs\r\nExperiment Station had taken up and solved, on an experimental basis,\r\nmost of the problems arising in these commercial failures. A shortage of\r\nproduct at the outbreak of the war brought about the re-establishment of\r\na series of factories. The product as put on the market indicates that a\r\npermanent establishment of Camembert-making is entirely practicable.\r\n\r\nCamembert cheese is made from cow's milk either whole or very slightly\r\nskimmed; the removal of about 0.5 per cent of fat has been found to be\r\ndesirable if not actually necessary.\r\n\r\n+145. Description of Camembert.+[50]--These cheeses are made in sizes\r\n2½ to 4½ inches in diameter and 1¼ to 1½ inches in thickness. They are\r\nripened by the agency of molds and bacteria which form a felt-like rind\r\nover their whole surface, 1/16 to 1/8 of an inch in thickness. This rind\r\nmay be dry and gray or grayish-green, consisting of a felt-like surface\r\nof mold on the outside, below which a harder portion consists of mold\r\nembedded in partially dried cheese, or the moldy part may be more or\r\nless completely overgrown or displaced by yellowish or reddish slime\r\ncomposed mainly of bacteria. Good cheeses may have either appearance.\r\n\r\nInside the rind, the cheese is softened progressively from the rind\r\ntoward the center from all sides, so that a fully ripe cheese has no\r\nhard sour curd in the center, but is completely softened. No mold should\r\nbe visible inside the rind, but the moldy rind itself is necessary\r\nbecause the ripening is caused by the enzymes secreted by the organisms\r\nof the rind into the cheese. As the curd ripens, the changed portion\r\nassumes a slightly deeper color than the unripe curd as a result of\r\nchemical changes. Well-ripened cheeses vary from nearly a fluid texture\r\nto the consistency of moderately soft butter. The ripening of Camembert\r\nis finished in wooden boxes which protect the cheeses from breaking\r\nafter they become soft and during the market period.\r\n\r\n+146. Conditions of making and ripening.+--These processes depend on a\r\nvery close adjustment between the composition of the freshly made cheese\r\nand the temperature and humidity of the rooms in which the cheeses are\r\nmade and ripened. Very slight failures in control bring loss in ultimate\r\nresults. The room for making Camembert should be maintained between 60°\r\nand 70° F. and should be wet enough to reduce drying to a minimum. The\r\nessentials of apparatus are comparatively inexpensive. Work on a factory\r\nbasis calls, however, for the installation of special tables and other\r\napparatus to utilize space and labor to advantage. Rooms are protected\r\nfrom change of weather by double sash in the windows. Flies must be\r\nexcluded by close-meshed screens for all doors and windows with movable\r\nsash. The equipment installed in such a room is shown in Fig. 18.\r\nCurdling cans are ranged on a shelf a few inches above the floor along\r\none side of the room below an open tin trough with side branches. This\r\nopen trough brings the milk from the mixing vat to the curdling cans.\r\n(The open tin trough offers no lodgment for dirt.) The cans hold about\r\n200 pounds of milk, are about 12 inches in diameter at bottom, and 20 to\r\n24 inches at top. They are heavily tinned. Iron trucks as high as the\r\nshelf and with tops the same diameter as the bottoms of the cans form a\r\nconvenient method of bringing cans of curd to the very edge of the\r\ndraining tables.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 18.--Camembert cheese-making room in an American\r\nfactory.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 19.--Draining mat for Camembert cheese.]\r\n\r\nThe wooden draining tables are placed about 32 inches above the floor;\r\nthey are usually made of 2-inch lumber, have raised edges and slope\r\nslightly toward the wall. Whey and wash water are thus carried to a\r\ndraining trough along the wall. For cheese-making, each is covered with\r\na strip of matting consisting of wooden strips held together by thread\r\n(Fig. 19). The strip of matting should be exactly the width and length\r\nof the table. The hoops used are heavy tin, with edges turned and\r\nsoldered, about 5 inches high, 4-5/8 inches in diameter with three rows\r\nof holes about 1/12 inch in diameter and 2 inches apart in the row.\r\nThese hoops are placed as thickly as possible upon the mats.\r\n\r\n+147. Outline of making process.+--The making process[51] is summarized\r\nas follows (Thom, 1909):\r\n\r\n_Starter._--From 0.5 to 1.0 per cent of active starter is added to milk\r\nkept overnight below 60°F.\r\n\r\n_Acidity at renneting._--Milk titrated to phenolphthalein should test\r\n0.20 to 0.23 per cent calculated as lactic acid.\r\n\r\n_Temperance of renneting._--84°-86° F. is used for Camembert.\r\n\r\n_Rennet._--From 3 to 5 oz. of standard rennet extract to 1000 lb. milk\r\n(10-15 c.c. per 100 lb. milk) produces a curd of proper texture.\r\n\r\n_Curdling time._--To reach the proper condition for handling, 1¼ to\r\n1½ hours or longer is required. This is indicated by the onset of\r\n\"sweating\" or the separation of large drops of whey on the surface of\r\nthe solid curd.\r\n\r\n_Dipping._--A long-handled dipper is used to transfer curd from cans to\r\nhoops. This can be lowered into the hoop. This transfer is to be done\r\nwith the least possible breaking. One dipperful is transferred at a time\r\nto each of a series of hoops. By the time the series is covered, some\r\ndrainage has occurred and a second dipperful is added to the contents of\r\nthe hoop. In this way the hoop is filled within a period of two to four\r\nhours.\r\n\r\n_Draining._--Hoops when properly filled have taken in approximately 2\r\nquarts of milk each. No pressure is used. Cheeses drain by gravity. They\r\nstand unturned until the following morning when they should be firm\r\nenough to permit turning without removing the hoops. The cheeses when\r\nfirm enough to handle (usually on the third morning) are salted by\r\ndusting the entire surface with coarse salt and permitting all that\r\nadheres to remain. The cheeses should then be removed to a room at about\r\n58°F. to prevent too rapid leakage of water and salt from their\r\nsurfaces. Ripe cheeses of good quality show a total salt-content varying\r\nfrom 2.25 to 3 per cent with an average of about 2.5 per cent. When so\r\nhandled there is slight, if any, loss of water and salt in the salting\r\nperiod of twenty-four to forty-eight hours. At the end of the salting\r\nperiod such cheeses should carry 55 to 57 per cent water or slightly\r\nmore.\r\n\r\n+148. Acidity.+--The essential biological factor in the making period of\r\nCamembert is proper souring. The milk should be free from gassy\r\norganisms. The lactic starter required should introduce the typical\r\nlactic organism (_Streptococcus lacticus_) in numbers sufficient to\r\nsuppress all other forms during the next twenty-four hours. The amount\r\nof acid starter introduced, however, plus the acid resulting from growth\r\nduring the curdling period, should not produce a grainy acid curd. The\r\ntemperatures of handling are such as to favor this group of organisms if\r\nproperly introduced and permit the development of nearly 1 per cent of\r\nacid (estimated as lactic) by the second morning. Cheeses with such acid\r\nare fairly free from further danger from bacterial activity. Members of\r\nthe high-acid group (_B. Bulgaricus_ and allies) may be found in these\r\ncheeses but do not appear to develop in numbers sufficient to affect the\r\ncheese to any marked degree.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 20.--Halloir, the first ripening room for Camembert\r\nin an American factory.]\r\n\r\n                       CAMEMBERT CHEESE RECORD\r\n\r\n  Date_______________   Set__________ No._____\r\n\r\n  Amt. milk___________  No. cheese_____  Milk per cheese________\r\n\r\n  Producer of milk_______________\r\n\r\n  Apparent cleanliness of milk_______________\r\n\r\n  +Acidity:+\r\n\r\n      Before adding starter____________________\r\n\r\n      After adding starter____________________\r\n\r\n      After acidity period____________________\r\n\r\n      Whey at dipping_______________\r\n\r\n  +Starter:+\r\n\r\n      Kind_______________  Age_____   Amt_____\r\n\r\n  +Color:+\r\n\r\n      Amount_______________\r\n\r\n  +Curdling:+\r\n\r\n      Temperature used__________\r\n\r\n      Amount of rennet__________\r\n\r\n      Time at which rennet is added__________\r\n\r\n      Time at which milk is curdled__________\r\n\r\n      Time of curdling__________\r\n\r\n      Quality of curd____________________\r\n\r\n  +Dipping:+\r\n\r\n      Cut or uncut_______________\r\n\r\n      Amt. of cutting_______________\r\n\r\n  +Draining:+\r\n\r\n      Temperature of room during__________\r\n\r\n      Condition of cheese after____________________\r\n\r\n  +Salting:+\r\n\r\n      Time of_____  Total amt. of salt used_____  Kind of salt_____\r\n\r\n      Amt. of salt per cheese_____\r\n\r\n  +Mold inoculation:+\r\n\r\n      Form of culture used_______________\r\n\r\n      Method of inoculation______________\r\n\r\n      Time of inoculation__________\r\n\r\n  +Remarks on making:+\r\n\r\n  +Curing:+\r\n\r\n      Transfer of curing rooms_________________________\r\n\r\n      Condition of cheese______________________________\r\n\r\n      Rooms____________________________________________\r\n\r\n      Dates____________________________________________\r\n\r\n  +Mold growth:+\r\n      Date of first appearance____________________\r\n      Purity and vigor____________________________\r\n      Date of changing color______________________\r\n\r\n  +Surface of slimy growth:+\r\n      Extent of___________________________________\r\n      General character of________________________\r\n\r\n  +Surface contamination:+\r\n      Mold________________________________________\r\n      Oidium______________________________________\r\n      Yeast_______________________________________\r\n      Bacterial___________________________________\r\n\r\n  +Wrapping:+\r\n      Date_______________   Material____________________\r\n      Condition of cheese_________________________\r\n\r\n  +Ripening:+\r\n      Rapidity of_________________________________\r\n      Texture_____________________________________\r\n\r\n  +Flavor:+\r\n      Ripened curd________________________________\r\n      Unripened curd______________________________\r\n\r\n  +Special treatment and reasons for same:+\r\n\r\n  Record of treatment by days____________________\r\n\r\n  Room__________   Date__________    Observations.____________________\r\n\r\n          1 D_____   16 D_____\r\n          2 D_____   17 D_____\r\n          3 D_____   18 D_____\r\n          4 D_____   19 D_____\r\n          5 D_____   20 D_____\r\n          6 D_____   21 D_____\r\n          7 D_____   22 D_____\r\n          8 D_____   23 D_____\r\n          9 D_____   24 D_____\r\n         10 D_____   25 D_____\r\n         11 D_____   26 D_____\r\n         12 D_____   27 D_____\r\n         13 D_____   28 D_____\r\n         14 D_____   29 D_____\r\n         15 D_____   30 D_____\r\n                     31 D_____\r\n\r\n+149. Ripening the cheese.+--The cheese is now ready for the ripening\r\nrooms (Fig. 20). For this process temperatures between 52° and 58°F. are\r\ndesirable; lower temperatures only delay the process; higher\r\ntemperatures favor undesirable fermentations. The cheeses rest upon\r\ncoarse matting (Fr. clayons) consisting of round wooden rods about the\r\nsize of a pencil separated 1-1¼ inches and held in position by wire\r\nstrands. Assuming cheeses of optimum composition as indicated above, the\r\nrelative humidity of the ripening rooms should be 86 to 88 per cent.\r\nHigher humidities produce too rapid development of slimy coatings; too\r\nlow humidity is indicated by drying, shrinkage and the growth of green\r\nmolds on the surface. A slight and very slow evaporation is demanded; by\r\nthis the water-content of the cheeses is reduced 3 to 6 per cent in two\r\nweeks. During the first two weeks of ripening, the cheeses commonly show\r\nsome growth of yeast and _Oidium lactis_ first, followed by cottony\r\nwhite areas of Camembert mold (_Penicillium Camemberti_). This mold must\r\nbe introduced by inoculation in new factories but once firmly\r\nestablished in the factory will propagate itself if conditions are kept\r\nfavorable. Climatic conditions in most dairy sections of America have\r\nbeen sufficiently unfavorable to make more or less continuous use of\r\npure cultures desirable. At the end of two weeks, Camembert cheeses\r\nshould show a well-established rind, consisting of a well-matted felt\r\nwork of mold hyphæ through the outer 2 mm. (1/12 inch) of the whole\r\nsurface of the cheese. More or less of the pale gray-green fruit of the\r\ncharacteristic _Penicillium Camemberti_ can usually be seen. Beginning\r\nat about twelve to fourteen days,[52] a softening of the curd is first\r\ndirectly detectable under the rind. This is preceded by the\r\ndisappearance of the acidity of the curd, which progresses inward. The\r\nsoftening of the curd follows closely the lowering of the acidity. Thus\r\na litmus test taken along the cut face of a Camembert cheese at any\r\nstage of softening will always show a sharp acid reaction in the solid\r\nsour portion which changes to alkaline just before the softening due to\r\nproteolytic action becomes noticeable. These two changes appear to be\r\ndue to enzymes secreted by the mycelium of the _Penicillium Camemberti_\r\nand _Oidium lactis_ which constitute the most active factors in the\r\nripening. Some accessory bacterial action is indicated but of minor\r\nimportance in the changes found.\r\n\r\nTo avoid loss from breaking, after the softening of the curd has fairly\r\nbegun, the cheeses must be removed from the coarse matting to smooth\r\nboards where they are watched and turned repeatedly, or as in the more\r\ncommon practice, wrapped at once in parchment paper and boxed. The\r\nripening may be completed in either way. The conditions necessary are\r\nsuch as to favor the extension of slimy areas of bacteria over part or\r\nall of the rind to the exclusion of further development of gray-green\r\nfruiting areas of mold.\r\n\r\nComplete softening may occur in three weeks in cheeses in which\r\nevaporation has gone on too slowly. Such cheeses are found to contain 51\r\nto 55 per cent of water when ripe and decay very quickly. If handled\r\nproperly, the water-content should fall from about 57 per cent at the\r\nbeginning of ripening to 48 per cent at its completion which should\r\nrequire a minimum period of about four weeks. It is more desirable that\r\na cheese four weeks old show a thin core of sour curd in the center than\r\nthat it be entirely liquid at that age.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 21.--Very soft Camembert cheese.]\r\n\r\n+150. Composition.+--Properly ripe Camembert shows about the following\r\nrange of composition: Water 47 to 49 per cent; fat 25 to 28 per cent;\r\nprotein 18 to 21 per cent; salt 2.2 per cent to 2.8 per cent. Variations\r\noutside these limits are usually associated with less desirable\r\nqualities. The approximate limits and characters outlined for Camembert\r\nstill leave a considerable latitude for variations in practice which\r\ncharacterize the output of particular factories in a producing group. At\r\none extreme are brands of Camembert cheese which are very soft (Fig.\r\n21), some of them actually liquid when ripe, and which have very strong\r\nodor and taste; one such brand has held first place in the trade of\r\ncertain American cities for years. Another popular brand when fully ripe\r\nis well covered with yellow-orange viscid slime[53] but is fairly firm\r\nin texture with high flavor; still others show dry moldy surfaces and\r\nmild flavors. The product of certain factories is always characterized\r\nby the presence and characteristic ammoniacal odor of _Penicillium\r\nbrevicaule_.\r\n\r\nEach of these forms seems to appeal to some classes of consumers, so\r\nthat in handling imported Camembert the trade comes to assign the\r\nproduct to specific groups of purchasers according to the conditions\r\nobserved at its arrival from Europe.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 22.--Camembert cheese factory at Lisieux, France.\r\nThe square windows are seen in the second-floor rooms.]\r\n\r\n+151. Factory.+--The type of factory to be used in making and ripening\r\nCamembert must be adjusted to the climate. This product originated in\r\nthe Normandy section of France which is but a few feet above sea level,\r\nis swept by winds from the Gulf Stream, and has a narrow range of\r\ntemperature, with highly humid conditions. In that region, every effort\r\nmust be made to secure ventilation to carry off the necessary amount of\r\nevaporation water. In contrast, most of the dairy sections of America\r\nhave land instead of sea breezes, much higher altitudes, much greater\r\nextremes of temperature and a lower range of relative humidities. The\r\nconditions of an upstairs room full of windows in Normandy (Fig. 22) are\r\nmost readily reproduced in rooms partly or completely below ground in\r\nthis country. The industry calls for the production and maintenance of a\r\nspecific set of working conditions. These are furnished by nature in\r\nnorthern France, probably also in certain Pacific coast areas, but must\r\nbe artificially obtained where the climate is unfavorable.\r\n\r\n+152. Economic factors.+--Camembert cheeses show a yield of about 13\r\npounds to 100 pounds of milk testing 4 per cent fat. At roughly one-half\r\npound each, the number of cheeses will be approximately twenty-six.\r\nAssuming no losses and a wholesale price of 15 cents each, the wholesale\r\nvalue of 100 pounds of milk would be $3.90. The labor cost of production\r\nis high, the package represents (box, wrapping and label) at least 1½\r\ncents a cheese. The time between the purchase and the consumption of the\r\ncheese will average about one month. Few cheeses actually remain this\r\nlength of time in the possession of the maker. This short investment\r\nperiod, therefore, is a distinct advantage of Camembert. Among\r\ndisadvantages, however, the extremely perishable character of the fully\r\nripe cheese makes provision of an adequate and constant market\r\nessential. Losses due to failures in manufacturing or ripening\r\nconditions are also frequent. Excessive heat in summer and very cold\r\nperiods in winter are both unfavorable. The Camembert-maker cannot,\r\ntherefore, use the cheapest milk of the summer months at all and the\r\nlosses entailed by failure of control in winter fall on the most costly\r\nmilk of the year. Camembert requires, therefore, careful selection of\r\nthe location for manufacture and ripening, effective control of\r\nconditions throughout the period and adequate marketing facilities.\r\nCamembert at its best is one of the finest of all cheeses; when bad, it\r\nbecomes quickly inedible and is a total loss.\r\n\r\n+153. French Brie.+[54]--Brie cheese has its center of production in\r\nSeine-et-Marne, east of Paris in northern France. The apparatus,\r\narrangement of the factories and details of manipulation differ from\r\nthose described for Camembert, but the final product is in flavor and\r\ntexture closely related to Camembert. Brie cheeses are the same\r\nthickness as Camembert, 1 to 1¼ inches; in diameter, however, there\r\nare three or more sizes varying from 8 to 16 inches, or even greater.\r\nThe largest cheeses weigh 5 to 6 pounds. As in Camembert, practices of\r\nmaking and ripening vary to such a degree as to produce various\r\nqualities of product. These run from whole milk through all shades of\r\nskimming. Perhaps the best established practice puts the cheese-making\r\nroom next to the stalls of the cows. The milk is drawn, strained\r\ndirectly into the curdling cans and renneted while still warm,--86-92°\r\nF. (30-33° C.). No lactic starter is added and no ripening period is\r\ngiven to the milk. The other manipulations differ only in detail from\r\nCamembert. Ripening of Brie follows the same course with the same\r\norganic agents, namely, Camembert mold (_Penicillium Camemberti_) and\r\n_Oidium lactis_ with the accompaniment of a mixture of slimy organisms\r\nupon the surface of the cheese. The process admits of many minor\r\nmodifications each capable of affecting the product in a characteristic\r\nway. The judgment and skill of the maker is given a wide opportunity to\r\nestablish and work toward a particular ideal of appearance and texture\r\nand flavor. Brands with characteristic qualities, therefore, command\r\ntheir own market.\r\n\r\nBrie as known in France must not be confused with the American\r\n\"d'Isigny,\" or with the particular sizes of that type which have been\r\ncalled Brie on account of diameter only. Very little Brie as known in\r\nFrance has been made in America and only a limited amount has been\r\nimported for very restricted trade.\r\n\r\n+154. Coulommiers.+--Another member of the Camembert group is called,\r\nfrom its place of origin, Coulommiers. This form is made at the same\r\nthickness as Camembert and about 5¼ inches in diameter. It appears as\r\neither a ripened or unripe cheese. As a ripened cheese, Coulommiers is\r\nnot essentially different from Camembert except that some brands are\r\nmade without salting. As a cheese eaten unripe, it has certain\r\nadvantages over the other cheeses with the flavor of sour milk only. The\r\ncottage and (American) Neufchâtel group of cheeses comprises the best\r\nknown forms with the acid flavor. These cheeses are very perishable in\r\nnature. On the other hand, Coulommiers as eaten fresh can be held and\r\nused over a much longer time without loss. Coulommiers[55] in this sense\r\nis simply a fresh Camembert. Such a cheese, when ready for the salting\r\nprocess, is a firm sour mass, close textured, almost impervious to air\r\nand but slowly permeable to liquids. Spoilage in such a cheese begins\r\nonly on the outside, and not throughout the mass as in cottage cheese or\r\nNeufchâtel. Successive portions of such a cheese can be removed daily\r\nover a considerable period with no loss of substance aside from slight\r\nscraping at times and little or no change in flavor. This product has\r\nvery tangible merit for manufacture and use on the farm in many sections\r\nof America.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\n_SOFT CHEESES RIPENED BY BACTERIA_\r\n\r\n\r\nA bacterially-ripened series of cheeses parallels the mold-ripened group\r\nas typified by Camembert. Although the varieties overlap, these may be\r\nroughly grouped as: (1) those made from friable or soft curd; (2) those\r\nmade from firm or rubbery curd. In the first group, the curd is set at\r\n86° F., or below; in the second, the rennet is added at 90° F. or above.\r\nIn the first, the lower temperature and long curdling time with ripened\r\nmilk gives a soft friable curd which may be toughened somewhat by\r\ncutting and stirring in the whey. This section is typified by d'Isigny,\r\nAmerican Brie, Liederkranz. In the second, curdling of unripened milk at\r\ntemperatures of 90° F. or above insures a smooth elastic curd which\r\nfuses more or less completely into the firm rubbery mass typified by\r\nfreshly made Limburger.\r\n\r\n+155. The Isigny group.+--A series of names, d'Isigny, Brie, Brie\r\nd'Isigny, combined with trade names, are used for a domestic cheese,\r\nmade in a small number of factories distributed over New York,\r\nPennsylvania, Michigan, Illinois, Wisconsin, Iowa and California. The\r\ncheeses sold under the separate varietal names differ only in diameter;\r\ntheir thickness is fairly uniform; the process of manufacture and\r\nripening with resultant textures and flavors furnishes no fundamental\r\nvarietal characters, although the products of the several factories show\r\nnoticeable differences in market quality. D'Isigny, while the name of a\r\nFrench town famous for butter production, is not used to designate a\r\ncheese in France. It may, therefore, be accepted as a French name\r\narbitrarily applied to a domestic product. Brie as used in France is a\r\nmarkedly different cheese (p. 131), and the name should be dropped from\r\nthis form as made in America. As used for a member of this series made\r\nin America, it merely means cheese 7 to 15 inches in diameter. The\r\ncheese partakes of the characters of French Livarot, and of Pont\r\nl'Eveque without exactly reproducing either form.\r\n\r\nThe milk varies from separator skim to whole milk, with resultant\r\ndifferences in quality. Freedom from gas is essential to the best\r\nresults. The milk is curdled at 85° to 86° F. with sufficient rennet to\r\nproduce a very firm curd within a period of one and one-half hours. Curd\r\nis then cut in two directions, allowed to stand a few minutes or gently\r\nagitated to produce a very slight toughness or \"worked\" condition, then\r\nscooped into hoops 4½ to 5 inches in height and varying in diameter\r\nfrom 2½ to 15 inches according to the size selected for manufacture.\r\nTo aid in the escape of whey, three rows of holes 1/12 inch in diameter\r\nand 2 inches apart in the row are made in each hoop. The hoops are\r\narranged upon draining tables with more or less corrugated surface,\r\nwhich for best drainage should be covered with matting. The cheeses are\r\nallowed to drain without pressure. They are commonly turned the second\r\nmorning, although they are sometimes solid enough to turn within the\r\nfirst day. When fully drained, the cheeses are salted by rubbing coarse\r\nsalt on the surface, after which they stand an extra day. They are then\r\narranged upon shelves in a ripening room held between 50° and 60° F.\r\nwith humidity so high that evaporation is kept at a minimum. In this\r\nroom, a surface slime develops quickly. This consists of bacteria of\r\nseveral forms, yeasts, _Oidium lactis_ and accidental species of other\r\nmolds. During this ripening, the cheeses are turned, rubbed with the\r\nhands, washed with salt water and scraped if infected with molds which\r\nproduce colored colonies. In the course of ripening, the slimy surface\r\nlayer acquires a yellowish orange color with the strong odor and taste\r\ncharacteristic of the series.\r\n\r\nBrands of d'Isigny are made from every grade between separator skim and\r\nwhole milk. They reach the market in condition all the way from \"Kosher\"\r\nforms[56] which are eaten entirely unripe, to brands which approximate\r\nthe qualities of Limburger and others which approach Port du Salut.\r\n\r\nThe biology and chemistry of the ripening of this type of cheese have\r\nnot been completely followed. An initial souring process always takes\r\nplace quickly. _Oidium lactis_ is always present in some degree on the\r\nsurface, but the organisms in the yellowish to orange slime on the\r\nsurface of the cheese appear to produce the characteristic odor and\r\ntaste. These appear to be due to the development of volatile fatty\r\nacids, such as valerianic and caproic, which diffuse throughout the\r\ncheese, even penetrating the unripened sour portions. The same odor and\r\ntaste in varying intensity are present in Limburger, Brick, and a long\r\nseries of German varieties not handled in America.\r\n\r\nHigh-flavored cheeses such as these, form an acceptable part of the meal\r\nin cases in which the intensity of other flavors is such as to mask\r\nentirely the milder flavors of Camembert or cream cheese.\r\n\r\nIn composition, a characteristic whole-milk brand of this group showed\r\nthe following analysis:[57] water, 45.5 per cent; fat, 25.28 per cent;\r\nprotein, 18.22 per cent.\r\n\r\n+156. Raffiné.+[58]--This cheese is made in the French settlement of the\r\nIsle of Orleans in the St. Lawrence River. The practice seems to have\r\nbeen brought from France and represents an intermediate product between\r\nCamembert and perhaps Livarot, a cheese on the borderline between\r\nCamembert and Isigny as made in America. The outline of the making\r\nprocess as given follows: Milk freshly drawn is curdled without cooling,\r\nat approximately 90° F. The rennet is prepared on the farm. About\r\none-half hour is required for curdling. The curd is cut into 2-inch\r\ncubes. Whey is removed as fast as it separates. About two hours are\r\nrequired for draining. The curd then goes into the hoops. The metal\r\nhoops, which are closed at one end, are 6 inches high, 4½ inches in\r\ndiameter, with holes about 1/16 inch at intervals of about ½ inch, and\r\nstand upon three legs about 1 inch in height. When filled, the cheeses\r\nare left on a draining table. Some salt is put on top while draining.\r\nWhen the volume is reduced to one-half, the cheese is turned. The\r\ndraining room is kept at about 70° F. After they are firm enough to\r\nhandle, drainage is completed on racks covered with rush matting. These\r\nare arranged on special racks. The cheeses are turned twice a day, and\r\nwashed in slightly salted water every two days. After each washing, they\r\nare drained for two hours on cloth, and placed on clean matting. This\r\ntreatment continues about fifteen days.\r\n\r\nAfter fifteen days on the matting, the cheeses are ready for ripening.\r\nThey are first covered with cold brine and let stand twenty-four hours.\r\nThe cheeses are packed in rolls or tiers in boxes, covered with cloth\r\nand ripened at 45° F. They must be kept moist; if signs of drying\r\nappear, moisture must be added. If the cheeses develop yellow slime,\r\nthey are washed with clear water and rinsed in water with salt added.\r\nAfter a ripening period of three weeks, the cheeses should begin to be\r\nsoft when pressed with the finger. The growth of molds must be prevented\r\nby washing the boxes, cloths, and washing and scraping the cheeses if\r\nnecessary. When the cheeses are ready for the market, they are scraped\r\nclean and white, wrapped separately in cheese-cloth or parchment paper\r\nand packed into the boxes. Ripe cheeses are about 5 inches in diameter,\r\n1 inch thick and weigh a little over 5 ounces.\r\n\r\nThe outline of the Raffiné process follows:\r\n\r\n  coagulation by rennet       30 minutes\r\n  cutting and draining curd    2 hours\r\n  draining in hoops           10 hours\r\n  stand on mats               15 days\r\n  ripening in boxes           21 days\r\n    Total period              36 days\r\n\r\nThe treatment described closely resembles the handling of Livarot cheese\r\nin the department of Calvados, France.\r\n\r\n+157. Liederkranz cheese.+--Among the specialties in the bacterial group\r\nis Liederkranz, made from curd with the soft friable texture of a\r\nCamembert, molded in rectangular blocks of about 4 ounces in weight and\r\nripened very completely. Although this name is the private brand of a\r\nsingle factory, it has become widely known with the effect of creating a\r\ntype name in the American market. Analysis of this brand of cheese\r\ngives about 55 per cent water, 25 per cent fat, 17 per cent protein,\r\nwhich indicates a whole milk cheese.\r\n\r\n+158. Limburger cheese+[59] derives its name from the town of Limburg in\r\nBelgium. The manufacture of this cheese is now widely practiced in\r\nEurope and in certain parts of the United States, especially in New York\r\nand Wisconsin. Practically no cheese of this name is at present\r\nimported, and the practices described are limited to those in American\r\nfactories.\r\n\r\n+159. The milk.+--Limburger cheese is probably best known on account of\r\nits pronounced odor. Because of this characteristic pungent smell, it is\r\noften thought that the cheese is made in dirty or unsanitary places. On\r\nthe contrary, Limburger cheese is usually made in small factories which\r\nare clean and sanitary. Because of the constant attention required, a\r\ncheese-maker can handle only about 2000-2500 pounds of milk a day, and\r\nthen some help is necessary to care for the cheeses in the curing\r\nroom.[60] The discussion of the milk given in Chapter II applies to that\r\nto be made into Limburger cheese; however, Limburger requires sweeter\r\nmilk than do some of the other types. To be sure of obtaining very sweet\r\nmilk, it is the usual practice for the milk to be delivered without\r\ncooling morning and evening at the cheese factory. The cheese is made\r\ntwice a day. Because the milk must be delivered twice daily, it is\r\nobtained from only a few producers near the factory. A factory usually\r\ndoes not have more than eight to twelve patrons. Because of the small\r\nnumber of patrons, it is comparatively easy to obtain a supply of fresh\r\nclean milk.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 23.--A common type of Limburger cheese factory.]\r\n\r\nThe factories are variously built. A common type takes advantage of\r\nsloping ground so that the floor at one end may be on the ground level\r\nand run backward into a hillside until the other end is a cellar with\r\nsmall windows at the ceiling opening at the ground level (Fig. 23). The\r\nfamily of the cheese-maker often lives in the same building above the\r\nfactory.\r\n\r\n+160. Making the cheese.+--Limburger cheese is made from the whole milk.\r\nWhen the milk is received at the factory, it is placed in the cheese\r\nvat. As the milk is delivered both morning and evening without cooling,\r\nit reaches the factory at a temperature of 90 to 96° F. In some cases\r\nthe night's and morning's milk is mixed and then warmed to about 94° F.\r\nThis practice is not recommended but is frequently adopted, when the\r\nsupply of milk becomes too small to work in two lots. As soon as all of\r\nthe milk has been delivered, the cheese-making process begins. No\r\nstarter is used. The milk is not ripened because no acid development\r\nduring the making process is desired. The milk is set or curdled at the\r\ntemperature at which it is received at the factory, usually from 90 to\r\n96° F. Sufficient rennet extract is used to give a firm coagulation in\r\ntwenty to thirty minutes. This usually requires 2½ to 3 ounces of\r\nrennet extract for each 1000 pounds of milk: This is diluted in about\r\nforty times its own volume of cold water and added to the milk. (For\r\nmethod of adding rennet extract to milk, see Chapter V.) When the\r\ncoagulum has become firm so that it will split clean over the finger,\r\nthe curd is ready to cut. Coarse Cheddar cheese knives are used.\r\nSometimes only the perpendicular knife is employed, and the curd is\r\nbroken up while being stirred with the hands and rake. This usually\r\ncauses a large fat loss. After cutting, the curd is stirred first by\r\nhand and later with an ordinary wooden hay rake. Usually the curd is not\r\n\"cooked\" or heated after setting, though occasionally it is brought up\r\nas high as 96° F. to 98° F. If the curd does not firm up, the\r\ntemperature may be raised to 98° to 100° F. to aid in expelling the\r\nmoisture.\r\n\r\nWhen ready to dip, the curd should still be in large soft shiny pieces.\r\nIt requires from one hour to an hour and thirty minutes from the time\r\nthe rennet extract is added until the curd is ready to dip. When, in the\r\njudgment of the cheese-maker, the curd has become sufficiently firmed in\r\nthe whey, the whey is drawn down to the surface of the curd. The curd is\r\nthen dipped into the Limburger molds. These molds are 5 inches square by\r\n8 inches deep without top or bottom. Usually there are five or six of\r\nthese molds built together into a section. These molds are placed on a\r\ndraining table beside the vat and the curd is ladled into them with a\r\nlarge tin ladle. The draining table has strips on both sides and one end\r\nand slants toward the other end so that the whey will drain from the\r\ncurd and yet not go on the floor except at the one end. This makes it\r\neasy to save and catch the whey for stock feed.\r\n\r\n+161. Draining and salting Limburger.+--In some factories, a clean piece\r\nof burlap is put on the draining table and the molds and curd placed on\r\nthe burlap. This aids in the rapid draining of the whey from the curd\r\nand prevents the loss of curd particles. The curd should be turned\r\nfrequently in the mold to obtain uniform draining. The molds are\r\ntransferred to the salting room as soon as well drained, usually in\r\nabout twelve hours, but sometimes they are left until the following\r\nmorning. Here they are placed on another draining table, which has\r\nstrips about 5 inches high on the sides and one end. The cheeses are\r\nplaced along this board, each cheese being separated by a piece of board\r\n4 inches high and 5 inches wide. When the row is filled, a long strip\r\nthe length of the table is placed against the row. Another row is laid\r\ndown against this strip in the same manner as the first, and so on until\r\nseveral rows are on the table. The last long strip is held firmly in\r\nplace by sticks wedged between it and the opposite side of the table.\r\nThese strips and pieces form a mold for each cheese while draining.\r\nUsually the cheeses are turned several times in this period to obtain a\r\nuniform expulsion of whey. In about twenty-four hours the cheeses are\r\nready to be salted. This is done by applying the salt to the outside of\r\nthe cheese. The edges are rolled in a box of salt and the salt then\r\nrubbed on the two broad surfaces. Any excess salt is brushed from the\r\ncheese with the hand. The cheeses are then laid on a draining table in\r\nsingle layers. The second day, they are salted again in the same way and\r\npiled two deep; they are salted again the third day and piled three or\r\nfour layers deep. The salting room or cellar should have a temperature\r\nof 60° F. and be fairly damp. The amount of salt used is very important.\r\nThe tendency is to use too much salt. This retards the ripening process\r\nand in extreme cases gives the cheese a salty taste. If not enough salt\r\nis used, the cheese will deteriorate very rapidly on account of the\r\ndevelopment of undesirable types of fermentation. The cheeses when\r\nsalted are then placed in the curing room, which is a cellar, usually\r\nbeyond the salting room. This cellar should have a temperature of 58° to\r\n64° F. and a relative humidity of 95 per cent of saturation. In winter\r\nit is necessary to have a fire to keep the rooms warm, otherwise the\r\ncheese would cure very slowly or not at all. In some factories the\r\ncuring and salting cellars are a single room.\r\n\r\n+162. Ripening Limburger.+--When first placed in the curing cellar, the\r\ncheeses are put on edge close together, and as they cure are gradually\r\nseparated. While in the curing cellar, the cheese must be rubbed\r\nfrequently by hand and washed, usually with salt water. The object of\r\nthe rubbing is to keep the surface of the cheese moist and prevent the\r\ngrowth of molds. The drier the cheese and the more mold, the oftener the\r\ncheeses must be rubbed. The drying or the evaporation from the cheese\r\ncan be retarded by sprinkling the floor of the cellar with water. When\r\nfirst placed in the curing cellar, they are usually rubbed daily; after\r\na few days they are rubbed every other day and finally as often as the\r\ncheese-maker can find time to work at them. The more the cheeses are\r\nrubbed, the better the rind.\r\n\r\nIn the curing of Limburger cheese, protein compounds are attacked by the\r\nmicro-organisms. Certain highly-flavored fatty acids are commonly\r\nproduced.[61] This change works most rapidly near the outside and more\r\nslowly toward the center of the cheese. The stage of ripening can be\r\ndetermined by examining the cheese. When first made, a cheese is harsh\r\nand hard and the outside is more or less white: as the curing changes\r\ntake place, the cheese becomes soft and pasty or buttery. The outside\r\ncolor changes from a whitish to a yellowish and finally even a reddish\r\nbrown. It requires considerable time for the ripening agents to work\r\nfrom the outside to the center of the cheese. As ripening progresses,\r\nLimburger cheeses tend to become soft enough to break in handling. If\r\nsuch cheeses are wrapped in manila paper after three to four weeks of\r\nripening and packed in boxes, losses from handling are eliminated. One\r\nloose board is left on each box and the boxes remain in the ripening\r\ncellar until the cheese-maker decides by removal and examination of\r\ncheeses from time to time that they are ready for shipment. When fully\r\nripe, the cheese spoils very quickly. Unless handled very carefully, the\r\nouter part may actually rot before the interior is fully ripe. The\r\ncheeses are shipped from the factory when they are eight to ten weeks\r\nold. They are then placed in cold storage, which checks the action of\r\nthe ripening agents and so lengthens the commercial life of the cheese.\r\n\r\n+163. Marketing and qualities of Limburger.+--As shipped from the\r\nfactory, each cheese is wrapped in heavy manila paper and frequently\r\nalso in tin-foil. The cheeses are packed in boxes which hold\r\nforty-eight. Each cheese weighs about two pounds.\r\n\r\nLimburger cheese should be regular in shape. The rind should not be\r\ncracked or broken nor the sides bulged, nor should it be lopsided. It\r\nshould have the pronounced characteristic flavor, without other\r\nobjectionable flavors due to undesirable fermentations. The body should\r\nbe uniform throughout. It is common to find cheeses that have not a\r\nuniform body, due to lack of curing; a small part of the interior at the\r\ncenter will be hard and not cured, while the remainder of the cheese\r\nwill be soft and buttery. The color should be uniform. When not entirely\r\ncured, the uncured part at the center is usually of a lighter color.\r\n\r\nThe cheese should contain the proper amount of salt. The most common\r\ndefect is in the flavor. If the milk is not free from bad odors and\r\nflavors, these are apt to be more pronounced in the cheese than in the\r\nmilk. (For care of milk see Chapter II.) Gas-forming fermentations are\r\nvery bad in this variety of cheese as they cannot be controlled and give\r\nthe cheese a bad flavor and a \"gassy body.\" When a cheese is gassy, the\r\nsides are most liable to be bulged and the body is full of gas holes or\r\npockets. Another defect is a sour cheese. This is caused by the\r\ndevelopment of too much acid in the milk or during the manufacturing\r\nprocess. A sour cheese usually cures slowly and has a pronounced sour\r\ntaste. The body is hard and bitter.\r\n\r\nIf the cheese contains too much moisture, it will cure rapidly and the\r\nbody will be very soft and pasty. In extreme cases it will be so soft\r\nthat it will run when the rind is broken. On the other hand if the\r\ncheese does not contain sufficient moisture, it will cure very slowly\r\nand the body will be hard and dry and sometimes crumbly. There is no\r\nstandard score-card for judging Limburger cheese. The Wisconsin\r\nCheese-makers Association[62] uses the following score-card for\r\nLimburger:\r\n\r\n  Flavor     40\r\n  Texture    40\r\n  Color      10\r\n  Salt        5\r\n  Style       5\r\n            ---\r\n    Total   100\r\n\r\n+164. Yield and composition of Limburger.+--The yield of cheese depends\r\non: (1) the amount of fat and other solids in the milk from which it is\r\nmade; (2) the amount of moisture incorporated into cheese; (3) the loss\r\nof solids during the manufacturing process.\r\n\r\nThe yield varies from 12 to 14 pounds of cheese from 100 pounds of milk.\r\nThe more fat and other solids in the milk, the more cheese can be made\r\nfrom 100 pounds of the milk. The more moisture incorporated into the\r\ncheese, the larger the yield. The quality of the cheese and the amount\r\nof solids determine the amount of moisture that can be incorporated into\r\nthe cheese. The greater the losses during the manufacturing process, the\r\nless is the yield. The composition of Limburger cheese is affected by\r\nthe same factors as the yield. The average cheese probably carries from\r\n40 to 42 per cent of moisture. Limburger cheeses will vary in\r\ncomposition from this analysis about as follows: water 38 to 44 percent,\r\nprotein 21 to 25 percent, fat 25 to 30 percent. The differences in\r\npractice in factory groups are considerable. Certain markets call for\r\nmore solid brands, others for the very soft forms.\r\n\r\n+165. Münster cheese+ originated in Germany near the city whose name it\r\nbears. There is a limited demand for this variety in America; therefore\r\nit is not extensively made. It is usually manufactured from whole milk\r\nin a Limburger or Brick cheese factory. The process of manufacture is\r\nbetween that of these two varieties in temperatures used, firmness of\r\ncurd and amount of moisture in the curd and cheese. The process is\r\nprobably more like that of Limburger. The curd is firmed more in the\r\nwhey than for Limburger, and more acid is developed. The cheeses are\r\npressed or drained in round forms 7 inches in diameter and 6 inches\r\nhigh. The hoops are lined with cloth to prevent the loss of curd\r\nparticles while draining. When the cheeses are sufficiently drained,\r\nuntil they are firm enough to hold their shape, the cloths are removed.\r\nThe cheese is salted by rubbing dry salt on the surface or soaking the\r\ncheese in brine. The product is handled in the curing room very much the\r\nsame as Limburger or Brick cheese. When sufficiently ripe, each cheese\r\nis wrapped in parchment paper and placed in a separate wooden box. This\r\ncheese, when cured, has a characteristic flavor which is between that of\r\nLimburger and Brick. The body is more or less open. The essential factor\r\nin the manufacture of Münster cheese is clean milk. Bad fermentations,\r\nsuch as produce gas and bad flavors, seriously interfere with the\r\nmanufacture and sale of the product. The cheese is usually made in the\r\nlate fall and winter, when it is difficult to manufacture Limburger.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nSEMI-HARD CHEESES\r\n\r\n\r\nBetween the quickly perishable soft cheeses and the typical hard group,\r\nare two series of varieties, one ripened by green mold and best known by\r\nRoquefort, the other ripened by bacteria and typified by Brick cheese.\r\nThese cheeses are fairly firm, hold their shape well, ripen over a\r\nperiod varying from a few weeks to several months and their marketable\r\nperiod is comparatively long. In texture they are intermediate between\r\nthe conditions known as \"soft\" and \"hard.\" In water-content, they range\r\nat their best from 37 to 45 percent. Outside these limits, the cheeses\r\nare often marketable but they lose in quality[63] and trueness to type.\r\n\r\n+166. The green mold group.+--There are three well-known semi-hard\r\ncheeses ripened by green or blue-green mold.[64] The mold is an\r\nincidental factor in certain other forms but none of these forms has won\r\nlarger than local or purely national recognition. French Roquefort, on\r\nthe contrary, is probably the most widely known of all cheeses. Stilton,\r\nto a small degree at least, has followed the English to the many lands\r\nthey inhabit. Gorgonzola, although made in Italy alone, has a large\r\nmarket in other parts of Europe and in America. In the manipulations of\r\nmanufacture, these forms are not closely related but they resemble each\r\nother in that each becomes streaked or marbled by the growth of green\r\nmold (_Penicillium Roqueforti_) through open spaces within the cheese.\r\nThe \"blue-veined\" or marbled cheeses have a characteristic taste which\r\nis developed in its most typical form in Roquefort.\r\n\r\n+167. Roquefort cheese.+--This is a rennet cheese made from sheep's milk\r\n(with occasional and minor admixture of goat's and cow's milk) in the\r\nsection of southern France centering about Roquefort in Aveyron. The\r\npractices are standardized and controlled by a few companies, thus\r\nreaching exceptional uniformity. Roquefort is uncolored, open, made from\r\nfirm but brittle or crumbly, not tough or waxy curd. Each cheese is\r\nabout 7¼ inches (20 cm.) in diameter and 3¼ inches (9 cm.) in\r\nthickness without a definite rind, and when ripe enough for market is\r\nscraped carefully, closely covered with tin-foil and kept in\r\nrefrigerators. The cut cheese shows extensive open spaces which are\r\nlined with green mold. This cheese, in addition to a strong cheesy odor\r\nand taste, has a peppery or burning quality which according to\r\nCurrie[65] is due to the formation of volatile fatty acids such as\r\ncaproic, caprylic and capric from the butter-fat of the sheep's milk\r\nused. A series for Roquefort cheeses selected for excellent quality was\r\nfound by Dox[66] to show the following composition:\r\n\r\n  TABLE IV\r\n\r\n  COMPOSITION OF ROQUEFORT CHEESE\r\n\r\n  =========================================================\r\n                | WATER  | FAT   | PROTEIN | ASH  | SALT\r\n                | PER    | PER   | PER     | PER  | PER\r\n                | CENT   | CENT  | CENT    | CENT | CENT\r\n  --------------+--------+-------+---------+------+--------\r\n    Average     | 38.69  | 32.31 | 21.39   | 6.14 | 4.14\r\n    Minimum     | 37.49  | 31.50 | 19.14   | 5.18 | 3.64\r\n    Maximum     | 40.10  | 33.53 | 23.06   | 6.81 | 4.88\r\n  =========================================================\r\n\r\nThe composition of the sheep's milk of the Roquefort producing region is\r\nreported by Marre:[67]\r\n\r\n  TABLE V\r\n\r\n  COMPOSITION OF SHEEP'S MILK\r\n\r\n  =============================================================\r\n               | WATER | CASEIN |   FAT    | LACTOSE |  ASH\r\n               |  PER  |  PER   |   PER    |   PER   |  PER\r\n               |  CENT |  CENT  |   CENT   |   CENT  |  CENT\r\n  -------------+-------+--------+----------+---------+---------\r\n    Range      | 76-83 |  5-8   | 5.5-10.5 | 4 to 5  | 0.8-1.2\r\n    Average    | 79.5  |  6.5   |   8.0    |   4.5   |   1.0\r\n  =============================================================\r\n\r\nThe cheeses when properly made in the local factories are transported to\r\nRoquefort for ripening in the famous caves which have made possible the\r\ndevelopment of a great industry.\r\n\r\nThe Roquefort caves were originally natural openings leading back into\r\nthe face of a cliff until they reached a deep, narrow fault or crack in\r\nthe rock leading to the plains above. The cooler air from the plains\r\ncame down this crack over moist and dripping rocks and issued through\r\nthese clefts in a cold moisture-laden current which kept the caves about\r\n50 to 55° F. and moist enough to ripen the cheeses without shrinkage. As\r\nthe business outgrew the natural caves, great cellars, some of them five\r\nor six floors deep, were excavated and tunnels were dug back to the\r\ncrack so that the strong ventilating current reaches every part of the\r\ncellars and keeps both temperature and relative humidity favorable to\r\nthe ripening of the cheeses.\r\n\r\n+168. Cow's milk or Façons Roquefort.+--The supply of Roquefort is\r\nautomatically limited by the supply of sheep's milk. The sheep gives\r\nmilk only about five months in the year and at best a scant average of\r\nabout a pint a day to a sheep. Sheep's milk for cheese-making is not\r\nproduced, therefore, outside of very limited regions. Some cow's and\r\ngoat's milk unavoidably finds its way regularly into the industry\r\nitself. Attempts were naturally made to substitute cow's milk. Outside\r\nthe controlled area, factories were established for this purpose. The\r\nquality of the product did not equal that of the Roquefort factories,\r\nand French courts decreed that the name Roquefort should not be used for\r\nsuch products. Although some local success was obtained, not much\r\nprogress was made against the intrenched Roquefort industry. Similar\r\nattempts to make such a product in Germany[68] were tried on an\r\nextensive scale but failed. More recently, under the inspiration of\r\nConn, the United States Department of Agriculture and the Storrs\r\nExperiment Station have studied the possibilities of such an industry.\r\nAlthough the work is not completed, the preliminary reports[69] have\r\nindicated the fundamental principles which must underlie such\r\ndevelopment.\r\n\r\n+169. Outline of making Roquefort.+--Some of the results of these\r\nexperiments are summarized in the following paragraphs:\r\n\r\n_Milk._--Clean-flavored fresh milk testing 4-4.2 per cent fat and up to\r\n2.8 per cent casein gives the best results. The milk with a high\r\npercentage of cheese-making solids forms a firmer curd, hence works up\r\nbetter in the process than milk of lower quality.\r\n\r\n_Acidity._--The milk is ripened by lactic starter up to an acidity of\r\n0.23 per cent titrated as lactic acid at the time rennet is added. This\r\ngives a firm curd, which drains to the desired water-content but is low\r\nenough to prevent the toughening effect of too high acid. A very slight\r\nincrease in initial acid--1 to 2 hundredths per cent--combined with the\r\nrate at which acidity is developing introduces such physical changes in\r\ntexture as to make the final texture of Roquefort impossible.\r\n\r\n_Temperature._--Rennet is added at or below 84° F. Every degree of heat\r\nadds definitely to the efficiency of rennet. Below 82° F., curdling\r\nbecomes slower and the coagulum softer and more difficult to drain. The\r\nsheep's milk curd is made from 76° to 84° F. but sheep's milk has about\r\ntwice the cheese solids found in cow's milk. It was found necessary to\r\nraise the temperature as high as texture would permit. However, at 86°\r\nF. the physical character of the curd tends to become tough or waxy in\r\nhandling. At 84° F. the curd remains brittle and crumbly. It was,\r\ntherefore, necessary to keep the curdling temperature down to 84° F.\r\n\r\n_Renneting or setting._--Rennet at a rate of 3 to 4 ounces of standard\r\nliquid rennet to 1000 pounds (10 to 12 c.c. to 100 pounds) was found to\r\ngive the best curd under experimental conditions.\r\n\r\n_Curdling time._--One and one-half to two hours gave most satisfactory\r\nresults in forming curd. This should be very firm and stand until it\r\nbegins to \"sweat,\" until beads of whey have begun to collect upon its\r\nsurface.\r\n\r\n_Cutting._--The cow's milk curd gave best results when cut in two\r\ndirections with the half-inch curd knife. The resulting columns, a half\r\ninch square in cross-section, may be handled without excessive losses.\r\n\r\n_Draining._--The cut curd is dipped to a draining rack covered with\r\ncloth with as little breaking as possible. During the draining process,\r\na certain amount of turning is necessary to facilitate the separation\r\nand escape of the whey. If handled too much, losses of fat are increased\r\nand the curd becomes tough or waxy instead of remaining brittle or\r\ncrumbly. When properly handled, not over 0.35 per cent of fat is lost.\r\nUnder favorable conditions, four-ninths to two-thirds of the original\r\nweight of curd will separate and run off as whey in twenty to thirty\r\nminutes. The curd meanwhile is exposed to the air of the room and cools\r\ntoward room temperature. If cooling goes too far, further drainage is\r\ninterfered with. Hence the curd is put into the hoop and the drainage\r\ncompleted while the cheese is reaching its final form.\r\n\r\n_Hoop._--Hoops for cow's milk Roquefort must be 7½ inches in diameter\r\nand about 5¾ inches high to hold curd enough to produce a cheese the\r\nsize of the standard Roquefort when completely drained. Sheep's milk\r\nwith its higher percentage of solids does not require such high hoops.\r\nThe curd as it goes into the hoop should be a soft, pulpy mass with no\r\nsuggestion of toughness.\r\n\r\n_Inoculation with mold._--The mold for Roquefort cheese (_Penicillium\r\nRoqueforti_[70]) is readily grown in pure culture in ordinary loaves of\r\nbread. For this purpose loaves hot from the oven are quickly drenched\r\nwith or immersed in hot paraffine to form an impervious crust to retain\r\nmoisture as well as to keep out contaminations. It is then allowed to\r\ncool. The interior of each loaf is inoculated by drawing a suspension of\r\n_P. Roqueforti_ spores in water into a sterile pipette (10 c.c.) which\r\nis then thrust through the paraffined crust to the center of the loaf of\r\nbread and allowed to empty there. The hole is sealed up with paraffine.\r\nThese loaves are incubated for about a month at room temperature. When\r\ncut, every open space should be found lined with the green spores of the\r\nmold. When dry enough, the mass may be powdered, and put into an\r\nordinary pepper box. When the curd is ready to go into the hoop, this\r\nmold powder is sprinkled upon it from the pepper box.\r\n\r\n_Handling._--Freshly made cheeses are turned within the first hour to\r\ninsure the proper smoothness of both sides. Further draining is best\r\naccomplished in a room at about 64° F. with a relative humidity of 85 to\r\n90 per cent. If the surface of the cheese becomes too dry, a rind is\r\nformed. No real rind is permitted on Roquefort. If the temperature is\r\ntoo high, slime forms quickly and unfavorable fermentation may occur.\r\nSlime (bacteria and _Oidium lactis_ usually) must be scraped when it\r\nbecomes too heavy.\r\n\r\n_Salting._[71]--Experimental cheeses were found to give the best results\r\nwhen at the end of about three days' drainage they contained about 50\r\nper cent water. Such cheeses were salted by sprinkling the entire\r\nsurface lightly, replaced upon the drain boards for one day, salted\r\nagain and piled in two's. After another day they received the third\r\nsalting and were piled in three's for two days longer. A total of about\r\n10 per cent by weight of salt was used to secure an absorption of 4 per\r\ncent. At the same time the water-content dropped to 40 to 43 per cent.\r\nAfter salting is completed, the cheeses are brushed and punched with\r\nholes to permit oxygen to enter.[72] They are then ready for ripening.\r\n\r\n+170. Ripening of Roquefort.+--The ripening of experimental Roquefort\r\nhas required four to six months at a relative humidity of 85 to 90 per\r\ncent. This relative humidity is just below the equilibrium relative\r\nhumidity of the cheese, hence permits a shrinkage of 2 to 4 per cent in\r\nthe water-content of the cheese. This makes it possible to control the\r\namount of surface slime developed.\r\n\r\nIf the relative humidity goes too high, the surface slime of bacteria\r\nand yeasts becomes very heavy, soft and almost liquid, and follows the\r\nopenings into the cheese with resultant damage to appearance and flavor.\r\nEven under the conditions at Roquefort, this slime must be removed by\r\nrubbing or scraping several times to avoid injury to the cheeses,\r\ntogether with the production of bad odor and taste. If the humidity\r\nbecomes too low, the surface becomes dry, hard and cracks open, the\r\nfriable crumbly texture is injured, and there is considerable loss in\r\nweight. Salt forms about 4 per cent of the cheese. This is in solution\r\nin the water present, which is about 40 per cent, and makes a brine of\r\nabout 10 per cent strength. This strength of brine does not prevent the\r\ngrowth of the Roquefort mold (_Penicillium Roqueforti_) but does hinder\r\nthe development of _Oidium lactis_ in the open spaces within the cheese.\r\nAccurate adjustment of temperature and relative humidity in the ripening\r\nrooms to salt and water-content in the cheese is essential to proper\r\nripening. These conditions are furnished by the unique natural\r\nconditions of the caves of Roquefort. The production of such cheeses\r\nelsewhere depends either on the discovery of another locality with\r\nclosely similar conditions or on the artificial production and control\r\nof the necessary temperature and relative humidity. This has been done\r\non an experimental basis by the use of cold storage apparatus combined\r\nwith proper humidifiers.\r\n\r\nThe differences between working with sheep's and with cow's milk lie in\r\nthe making process rather than in the ripening. Sheep's milk freshly\r\ndrawn shows a higher acidity than cow's milk, probably on account of the\r\nacid reaction of its greater casein content. With nearly double the\r\ntotal solids of cow's milk, the yield to one hundred pounds is much\r\ngreater, consequently the drainage of the curd is much more easily\r\nhandled.\r\n\r\nOnce made and salted, the cheeses require very nearly the same\r\nconditions of ripening. The resultant products are alike in appearance\r\nand texture. In flavor, cow's milk Roquefort differs in character from\r\nsheep's milk cheese to such a degree as to be recognized by taste. The\r\ndifference was found by Currie[73] to be due to an actual difference in\r\nthe combination of fatty acids present.\r\n\r\nAlthough these differences in character are recognizable by the expert\r\nin testing the cheese, as well as by chemical analysis, cow's milk\r\nRoquefort would satisfy that large proportion of consumers who use such\r\ncheese only in connection with other fairly high flavored foods. The\r\ndemands for technical skill and factory equipment are not naturally\r\ngreater than for many other lines of cheese-making. The gradual\r\ndevelopment of a cow's milk Roquefort may be anticipated.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 24.--Gorgonzola ripening establishment in valley\r\nnear Lecco.]\r\n\r\n+171. Gorgonzola+[74] is a rennet cheese made from fresh whole cow's\r\nmilk, in northern Italy. It takes its name from the village of\r\nGorgonzola, a few miles from Milan, but the manufacture of the cheese\r\nhas spread over a wide area. The cheeses are made on farms and in\r\nfactories from which they are transported for ripening to cool valleys\r\nof the Alps, principally near Lecco (Fig. 24). Boeggild introduced the\r\nmaking of a cheese after the Gorgonzola process into Denmark about 1885.\r\nThis industry has been successful on a small scale since that time.\r\nGorgonzola cheeses are about 30 cm. (12 inches) in diameter and 18 cm.\r\n(7 inches) thick and weigh 15 to 20 pounds. As exported they are usually\r\nheavily coated[75] with a mixture usually barite, tallow and lard\r\ncolored with annatto or other cheese color. This coating prevents\r\nshrinkage or mold on the surface of the cheese in transit. When cut\r\nthese cheeses vary greatly. All show marbling with mold (Roquefort\r\nmold). During their ripening they become very slimy at the surface. To\r\nopen up air spaces for mold growth, this slime is scraped off and holes\r\nare punched into the cheeses. These holes are readily seen in the final\r\nproduct. Some show crumbly texture, well distributed mold, as in\r\nRoquefort, with flavor approaching that cheese; in others the texture is\r\nwaxy rather than crumbly, a condition correlated regularly with\r\ndifferent character in the flavor. Frequently in whole areas or in small\r\npockets, slime consisting of bacteria and Oidium has followed the\r\nopenings into the cheese and affects its odor and taste.\r\n\r\nExperimental Gorgonzola cheeses comparable with the Italian product were\r\nmade with cow's milk ripened as for Roquefort or higher, to 0.25-0.30\r\nper cent (titrated as lactic acid), curdled at 86° F. (30° C.), cut into\r\ncubes and slightly stirred, then dipped to a draining board for about\r\none-half hour, and put into the hoop. The cheeses drained quickly to\r\nabout 50 percent water and developed a surface rind as in the harder\r\ncheeses. Cut surfaces showed a fairly open cheese in which mold grew\r\nreadily. These cheeses were salted to taste, not to a specified\r\npercentage. They ripened with the same irregular results and the\r\ncharacteristic range of flavors found in Gorgonzola. To avoid the\r\nrotting of the cheese by surface growths, they were exposed to low\r\nhumidities for a time and cracks opened at the surfaces, as seen in the\r\nripening rooms at Lecco (Fig. 24). The texture was more or less waxy or\r\ntough, which was correlated with the slightly higher heat at renneting\r\ntogether with the stirring or \"working\" of the curd. Comparative\r\nanalyses of a series of imported cheeses confirm the interpretation that\r\nthe salt-content of Roquefort, 4 per cent approximately, prevents the\r\ninvasion of the interior of the cheese by Oidium. No complete study of\r\nthe ripening of Gorgonzola has been made. As far as followed, it\r\nconsists in an initial souring process followed by ripening by molds and\r\nslime organisms. At its best, Gorgonzola is nearly equal to Roquefort\r\nbut the percentage of such quality is low. In spite of its irregular\r\nquality, England has used larger amounts of Gorgonzola than of\r\nRoquefort. Considerable quantities have been imported for the Italian\r\ntrade in the United States.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 25.--Gorgonzola cheese curing-room.]\r\n\r\n+172. Stilton cheese+ bears the name of an English village[76] in which\r\nit was first sold. It is made from cow's milk and is typically a whole\r\nmilk cheese, although part skim cheeses are regularly made and sold as\r\nlower grades. In the Stilton-making counties, the milk from Shorthorn\r\ncattle testing about 3.5 to 4.0 per cent fat is preferred to richer or\r\npoorer grades. Such milk is curdled with rennet at about 86° F. in about\r\none hour; the curd is cut, dipped to a draining table covered with cloth\r\nand drained slowly over a period of several hours, commonly overnight.\r\nDuring this period considerable acidity is developed. The curd is then\r\nmilled or broken by hand, salted, packed into hoops 15 to 16 inches high\r\nand 7 inches in diameter. These hoops are made from heavy tin (Fig. 26)\r\nwith four rows of holes about 3/10 inch in diameter. The freshly filled\r\nhoops are allowed to stand and drain without pressure in a room at about\r\n70° F. (Fig. 26). Such cheeses are turned every day for several days.\r\nWhen solid enough to stand the hoops are removed, the cheeses are\r\nscraped or rubbed with a knife until the surface is smooth, and commonly\r\nwrapped with a cloth bandage to maintain the shape, if the cheese is\r\nstill too soft to stand firmly. In the factories, several rooms are used\r\nwith varying temperature and relative humidities, which makes it\r\npossible to place each cheese under the condition best suited to its\r\ntexture and condition of ripeness. In general, the dairy sections of\r\nEngland are much more humid than those of America and there are less\r\nviolent changes in temperature. Stilton cheese-making has grown up to\r\ntake advantage of this climatic factor in handling the product.\r\nTransplantation of such an industry necessitates a mastery not only of\r\nthe manipulations but a grasp of the fundamental principles underlying\r\nthe process and a readjustment of practices to preserve those\r\nprinciples.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 26.--Stilton cheeses in hoops, draining.]\r\n\r\nStilton is, then, a soured curd cheese in whose ripening a very\r\nprominent part is played by the green mold (usually some strain of _P.\r\nRoqueforti_) which grows throughout the cavities of its mass[77]. At\r\nits best, it has attractive texture and flavor. Much of it fails to\r\nreach high quality on account of the invasion of bacteria, _Oidium\r\nlactis_, and very frequently myriads of cheese mites. The following\r\nanalysis was furnished as typical for ripe cheese by Miles Benson,[78]\r\nlate professor of dairying at Reading, England: Water 31 per cent, fat\r\n36 per cent, casein 29 per cent, mineral constituents including salt\r\nabout 4 per cent. Approximately the same figures are given by Primrose\r\nMcConnell (Agricultural Note Book). The low percentage of salt is\r\nanother factor of uncertainty in the control of this Stilton product, as\r\nin Gorgonzola, since these cheeses are commonly high in water-content at\r\nfirst and are thus subject to invasion by Oidium.\r\n\r\nStilton has been made on a small scale in Canada[79] and occasionally\r\nattempted in the United States. No serious effort to develop an industry\r\nof commercial importance has been made in America. Comparative study of\r\nthe cheeses ripened by green mold tends to the conviction that the\r\nadaptation of the Roquefort practice to the use of cow's milk offers a\r\nmore satisfactory basis for experiment than efforts to establish a\r\nStilton or a Gorgonzola industry.\r\n\r\n+173. Gex.+--A cheese under this name made in southern France resembles,\r\nin its general character as a ripened cheese, the English Stilton and\r\nItalian Gorgonzola. Although it has no commercial importance, reference\r\nis made to this cheese to show that mold-ripened cheeses have been\r\ndeveloped entirely independently in different countries to bring about\r\nthe same general character of product.\r\n\r\n+174. Bacterially ripened series.+--The semi-hard cheeses ripened by\r\nbacteria stand half-way between true Limburger and the hard forms. In\r\nfact, brands of Limburger are readily found which approach the texture\r\nand ripening of Brick cheese. In the same way, Brick cheeses are often\r\nfound which have the appearance, texture and much of the flavor of the\r\nCheddars with only a trace of the taste of Limburger. Port du Salut,\r\nOka, Münster, in France Livarot, in the Balkan regions Kascoval, belong\r\nin this series.\r\n\r\n+175. Brick cheese.+--The name of this cheese is probably due to the\r\nfinished product being about the size and shape of a brick. It is\r\nsimilar to the German cheese Bäckstein and may have been developed from\r\nit. It is typically a sweet-curd cheese, made from milk freshly drawn,\r\nwithout permitting the development of appreciable quantities of acidity\r\nuntil after the curd has been put into the hoop. In the making process,\r\nit is intermediate between Limburger and the cheeses of the Cheddar\r\ngroup. Some cheese-makers use an ordinary cheese vat, others a copper\r\nkettle in manufacturing.\r\n\r\nIt is the usual practice to deliver the milk to the cheese factory both\r\nmorning and evening, without cooling. Cheese is made twice a day. In\r\nsome cases the milk is delivered only once a day, and extra precautions\r\nmust then be taken to care for the milk properly.\r\n\r\nThe discussion of the care of milk in Chapter II applies to that for\r\nBrick cheese. For the best quality of cheese, the milk in the vat\r\nshould show about 0.15 of 1 per cent acidity and never above 0.18 of 1\r\nper cent.[80]\r\n\r\n+176. Making of Brick cheese.+[81]--The milk is received at the cheese\r\nfactory at a temperature of about 92° to 96° F. For the best results,\r\nthe acidity should be determined (by the acid test) to decide on the\r\namount of starter to use. Few Brick cheese-makers use an acid test or a\r\nstarter but these precautions would improve the product of many\r\nfactories. For method of using the acid test, see Chapter V. Chapter IV\r\ndiscusses the preparation and use of starter. Usually 0.25 to 0.50 of 1\r\nper cent of starter is the amount required. A small amount of starter is\r\nused to aid the development of lactic acid and for the beneficial effect\r\nit has on the flavor. A very small development of acid is desired after\r\nadding the starter; therefore the change in acidity should be very\r\ncarefully watched with the acid test. The vat is usually set when the\r\nacid test shows 0.16 of 1 per cent acidity. The more acid in the milk,\r\nthe less starter should be employed. Sufficient rennet extract should be\r\nused to give a coagulation suitable for cutting in thirty to thirty-five\r\nminutes. For method of adding the rennet extract, see Chapter V. When\r\nthe coagulum is firm enough for the curd to break clean over the finger,\r\nit is ready to cut. The curd is cut with coarse knives into 3/8- or\r\n½-inch cubes. After cutting, the curd is let stand three to five\r\nminutes, then stirred with the hands for a few minutes until the whey\r\nbegins to separate and then stirred with the rake. Some makers do not\r\nstir by hand but use the rake directly after cutting. When this is done,\r\ngreat care must be exercised to stir the curd without breaking up the\r\npieces, because this causes a loss of fat. After cutting the curd is\r\nstirred for twenty to thirty minutes before the steam is turned on. The\r\ncurd is heated very slowly at first and more rapidly during the last\r\nstages of cooking. The curd is cooked to a temperature of 110° to 115°\r\nF. The lower the temperature that can be used to produce firm curd, the\r\nbetter the texture of the cheese. After cutting and during the cooking,\r\nthe curd must be constantly stirred so that lumps will not form. When\r\nthe curd forms lumps, the moisture is not evenly expelled. This results\r\nin uneven texture and curing. Sometimes some salt is added to the curd\r\nin the vat to restrain souring. The curd is stirred after cooking until\r\nit is sufficiently firm. It remains usually in the whey for a total\r\nperiod of one and one-fourth to one and one-half hours from the time of\r\ncutting. It is then dipped into forms 10 inches long by 5 inches wide by\r\n8 inches deep. The forms are without top or bottom and are placed on a\r\ndraining table. This table is so constructed that the whey can be saved\r\nfor stock feed. When ready to \"dip,\" the whey is drawn down to the\r\nsurface of the curd in the vat, then the curd is dipped into the forms\r\nor hoops. Care must be taken to get the same amount of curd into each\r\nform to produce the cheeses of uniform size. Each cheese is turned\r\nseveral times to insure even draining and even reduction of the\r\ntemperature. While draining, a follower is placed in each hoop and a\r\nweight placed on each cheese. Usually a brick is used for this weight. A\r\ncheese is allowed to drain or press for ten to fifteen hours. It is\r\nthen placed on the salting table and rubbed with coarse salt. While on\r\nthe salting table, a cheese is placed on its broad side. Some\r\ncheese-makers prefer to salt their cheeses by soaking them in a salt\r\nbrine. This brine should be strong enough to float an egg. Salting\r\nrequires three days. The cheeses are then brushed free from excess salt\r\nand taken to the cellar to cure or ripen.\r\n\r\n+177. Ripening Brick cheese.+--For this process, the cellars are kept at\r\nabout 90 percent relative humidity and a temperature of 60° to 65° F.\r\nSome prefer a temperature for curing as high as 68° F. During the\r\ncuring, the surfaces of the cheese are kept moist and mold growths kept\r\ndown by rubbing or brushing the cheese with pure water or salt and\r\nwater. In the curing cellars the cheeses are placed on shelves; at first\r\nthey are set close together and as they cure, they are separated. During\r\ncuring, the color changes from a whitish to a reddish brown. The cheese\r\ncures from the outside toward the center. When first made, the product\r\nis harsh and hard in texture but during the ripening process it becomes\r\nmellow and smooth. The cheeses remain on the curing shelves for four to\r\nsix weeks, after which they are wrapped in heavy waxed paper and boxed.\r\nA cheese ready for market usually weighs about five pounds. A Brick\r\ncheese box is 5 inches deep by 20 inches wide by 3 feet long, and holds\r\n110 to 115 pounds of cheese.\r\n\r\n+178. Qualities of Brick cheese.+--The cheeses should be neat and\r\nattractive and the rind not cracked or broken. The sides should be\r\nsquare and not bulged. The cheese should have a clean, characteristic\r\nBrick cheese flavor. The body and texture should be mellow and smooth\r\nand when rubbed between the thumb and forefinger, should break down\r\nlike cold butter. The color should be uniform. The cheese should contain\r\nthe proper amount of salt and moisture. One of the worst faults with\r\nBrick cheese is bad flavor. This is many times due to the cheese-maker\r\nnot using clean flavored starter. It may also be due to bad flavored\r\nmilk. A Brick cheese-maker has no means of controlling gassy\r\nfermentations. These show themselves in the bad flavor of the cheese and\r\nin the porous body. They also cause the cheese to bulge. If detected,\r\ngassy milk should be rejected. If too much acid is developed, a sour\r\ncheese is the result. This will not cure normally and usually has a sour\r\nflavor. The body will be brittle and mealy. If too much salt is used,\r\nthe cheese may have a salty taste and it will cure very slowly. If not\r\nenough salt is used, the cheese may cure too rapidly and undesirable\r\nflavors and fermentations develop. The cheese must have the proper\r\nmoisture-content; if too much moisture is present, the cheese cures too\r\nfast and is soft and pasty in body; if not enough moisture, then the\r\nreverse is true. Tabulation of cheeses of special quality, as submitted\r\nin scoring contests, show an average water-content of 37 to 38 per cent,\r\nwith occasional cheeses verging toward Limburger in texture and flavor\r\nwith 40 to 42 per cent water, and others indistinguishable from Cheddar,\r\nwith water-content as low as 34 per cent.\r\n\r\nThe Wisconsin Cheese-makers Association uses the following score-card\r\nfor the judging of Brick cheese on a scale of 100:\r\n\r\n  Flavor      40\r\n  Texture     40\r\n  Color       10\r\n  Salt         5\r\n  Style        5\r\n             ---\r\n             100\r\n\r\n+179. Composition and yield.+--The composition of Brick cheese varies\r\nwithin wide limits. The average cheese probably contains from 37 to 39\r\nper cent of water, although many cheeses are above and below this\r\naverage; Doane and Lawson[82] give the fat as 28.86 per cent, proteins\r\n23.8 per cent and total ash 4.20 per cent.\r\n\r\nThe composition and yield are both affected by: (1) the moisture-content\r\nof the cheese; (2) composition of the milk from which made; and (3)\r\nlosses during the manufacturing process. The average yield of Brick\r\ncheese is 11 to 13 pounds to 100 pounds of milk.\r\n\r\n+180. Port du Salut cheese.+--The Trappist monks originated this type of\r\ncheese in their monasteries in France. Under the name of their community\r\nOka, it has been made and sold widely by the Trappist Fathers of Quebec.\r\nIn recent years, factories independent of the order have made such\r\ncheese both in America and in Europe.\r\n\r\nThe following outline of the making process indicates the close\r\nrelationship between Port du Salut and Brick cheeses. Whole milk or milk\r\nnot over one-fifth skimmed is ripened to medium acidity, then heated to\r\n90° to 95° F. according to season and acidity. Rennet enough is added\r\n(see Chapter V) to curdle in thirty to forty minutes, although some\r\nmakers shorten the time to twenty minutes. When formed, the curd is cut\r\ninto small cubes and excess of whey is dipped away. The constantly\r\nstirred mass is then heated or cooked to 100° to 105° F. within a period\r\nof ten to twelve minutes or according to some makers twenty to thirty\r\nminutes. It is allowed to stand a few minutes to settle. Most of the\r\nwhey is then drawn and the mass is stirred vigorously to prevent fusion\r\nof the curd granules. The curd is ready for the hoop when the particles\r\nare about the size of grains of wheat and do not stick together when\r\nsqueezed with the hand. The individual grains of curd should crumble\r\neasily between the fingers. The hot curd is transferred directly to the\r\nhoops without cooling. For this purpose, a hoop is set upon the table\r\ncovered with a cloth and the curd dipped into the cloth. The edges of\r\nthe cloth are then folded over. In this condition the cheese is\r\ntransferred to the press where gradually increasing pressure begins with\r\n3 to 4 pounds and reaches about 70 pounds. To insure proper shape,\r\ncheeses are turned and put into fresh cloths at the end of the first\r\nhour and turned subsequently several times during the pressing period of\r\nabout twelve hours.[83]\r\n\r\nPort du Salut cheeses are salted by rubbing fine salt on the surface by\r\nhand at the rate of 1.2 to 2 per cent of the weight of the cheese. After\r\nabout two days in the salting process, they are put into the ripening\r\ncellars. The cellars are wet, since they reach 90 to 95 per cent\r\nrelative humidity at a temperature of about 55° F. After two days in the\r\ncellar, the cheeses are plunged into a tank of saturated brine to which\r\na trace of cheese color has been added. As they come out of these tanks,\r\nthey are yellowish and greasy or slimy. They are returned to the\r\nshelves where they are rubbed every day with a cloth or by hands wet in\r\nbrine. After about one week they are again plunged in the brine.\r\nTreatment with brine tends to insure a firm rind. The cheeses are rubbed\r\nmore or less regularly with brine through the whole ripening period.\r\n\r\nAfter six weeks, such cheese may be eaten. The cut surface of Port du\r\nSalut is creamy in color, may or may not show small holes. In texture it\r\nis soft enough to spread readily under pressure without losing its shape\r\nin handling. In flavor the cheese is a mild form belonging to the\r\nLimburger group.\r\n\r\nPort du Salut cheeses as imported from France usually are firm round\r\ncakes about 1½ inches thick, weighing about 3 pounds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\n_THE HARD CHEESES_\r\n\r\n\r\nThe hard cheeses form a great series of groups, whose most prominent\r\nphysical character is their firm or hard texture. This is correlated\r\nwith comparatively low water-content, which is usually between 30 and 40\r\nper cent. Although certain varieties occasionally test above 40 per cent\r\nwater, this deviation is accompanied by quick ripening and rapid\r\nspoilage. These varieties of cheese are staple products with long\r\nmarketable periods; therefore they may be handled in large lots,\r\nshipped, carted and stored freely without the losses such treatment\r\nwould entail in soft cheese. The retailer frequently buys hard cheese by\r\nthe ton, not by the cheese or by the box.\r\n\r\nIn making, these varieties are characterized as cooked and pressed\r\ncheeses. Although both the heating of a curd and the pressing of a newly\r\nmade cheese occur among semi-hard forms, these practices appear in their\r\nmost typical forms in the hard cheeses.\r\n\r\nThe hard cheeses show two types of texture. A cut cheese may appear\r\nsmooth, free from holes or with a few angular cracks or seams, or it may\r\nshow round holes or \"eyes.\" In the smooth textured forms every effort is\r\nmade to prevent gassy fermentations, usually by controlling the\r\nfermentation of the curd in the making process. When \"eyes\" are present,\r\nthe end sought has been a development of a particular form of gassy\r\nfermentation which gives this appearance and brings about the\r\ncharacteristic ripening texture and flavor.\r\n\r\nThe hard cheeses have been developed in groups of national varieties.\r\nThe best known of these groups are those which may be represented by\r\nEnglish Cheddar, American Factory Cheddar, Danish, the Edam of Holland,\r\nSwiss and Parmesan with many related varieties in Italy and neighboring\r\ncountries of southern Europe.\r\n\r\n+181. The Danish group.+--The Danish cheeses are related in appearance\r\nand flavor to the English group represented by Cheddar. The demand for\r\nbutter in Europe has been so great that the Danish cheese-makers have\r\ndeveloped skim and part skim varieties largely to the exclusion of the\r\nwhole milk form. Skillful handling of their process has resulted in a\r\nproduct which has had a very large and appreciative market in England\r\nand Germany.\r\n\r\n+182. The Dutch group.+--Edam and Gouda are the two forms of cheese made\r\nin Holland and most widely known among other peoples. Both reach America\r\nin considerable quantities; both are shipped in large amounts to\r\ntropical countries. Although attempts have been made to manufacture them\r\nin America, no commercial production of these cheeses has been\r\nsuccessful. Although whole milk grades of these cheeses are known, they\r\nare to a large measure part skim in manufacture. The presence of one or\r\nboth of these forms in every large market in America makes the general\r\nfacts of their production of general interest. Parts of a report on\r\nexperimental work in the making of Edam and Gouda are, therefore, given\r\nhere.\r\n\r\n+183. Edam cheese+[84] is a sweet-curd type, made from partially\r\nskimmed-milk. It comes to the market in the form of round red balls,\r\neach weighing from 3½ to 4 pounds when cured. It is largely\r\nmanufactured in northern Holland and derives its name from a town famous\r\nas a market for this kind of cheese.[85] Milk from which one-fourth to\r\none-third of the fat has been removed is used. Too great pains cannot be\r\ntaken in regard to the condition of the milk. It should be fresh, free\r\nfrom every trace of taint; in brief, it should be in as perfect\r\ncondition as possible.\r\n\r\n+184. Method of manufacture.+--The following paragraphs give the steps\r\nin the manufacture of Edam cheese:\r\n\r\n_Treatment of milk before adding rennet._--The temperature of the milk\r\nshould be brought up to a point not below 85° F. nor much above 88° F.\r\nWhen the desired temperature has become constant, the coloring matter\r\nshould be added. Cheese color is used at the rate of 1½ to 2 ounces\r\nfor 1000 pounds of milk. The coloring matter should, of course, be added\r\nto the milk and thoroughly incorporated by stirring before the rennet is\r\nadded.\r\n\r\n_Addition of rennet to milk._--The rennet should not be added until the\r\nmilk has reached the desired temperature (85° to 88° F.) and this\r\ntemperature has become constant.\r\n\r\nWhen the temperature reaches the desired point and remains there\r\nstationary, the rennet extract is added. Rennet extract may be used,\r\n4½ to 5½ ounces being taken for 1000 pounds of milk, or enough to\r\ncoagulate the milk in the desired time, at the actual temperature used.\r\nThe milk should be completely coagulated, ready for cutting, in about\r\ntwelve to eighteen minutes from the time the rennet is added. The same\r\nprecaution observed in making Cheddar cheese should be followed in\r\nmaking Edam cheese with reference to care in adding the rennet, such as\r\ncareful, accurate measurement, dilution with pure water before addition\r\nto milk.\r\n\r\n_Cutting the curd for Edam._--When the curd breaks clean across the\r\nfinger, it should be cut; it is cut a very little softer than in the\r\nCheddar process as ordinarily practiced. As stated, this stage of\r\nhardness in the curd which fits it for cutting should come in twelve to\r\neighteen minutes after the rennet is added. First, a vertical knife is\r\nused and the curd is cut lengthwise, after which it is allowed to stand\r\nuntil the slices of curd begin to show the separation of whey. Then the\r\nvertical knife is used in cutting crosswise, after which the horizontal\r\nknife is at once used. Any curd adhering to the bottom and sides of the\r\nvat is carefully removed by the hand, after which the curd-knife is\r\nagain passed through the mass of curd lengthwise and crosswise,\r\ncontinuing the cutting until the curd has been cut as uniformly as\r\npossible into very small pieces.\r\n\r\n_Treatment of Edam curd after cutting._--When the cutting is completed,\r\none commences at once to heat the curd up to the temperature of 93° to\r\n96° F. The heating is done as quickly as possible. While the heating is\r\nin progress, the curd is kept constantly agitated to prevent settling\r\nand consequent overheating. As soon as the curd shows signs of\r\nhardening, which the experience of the worker will enable him to\r\ndetermine, the whey is drawn off until the upper surface of the curd\r\nappears, when one should commence to fill the press molds.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 27.--Edam cheese mold.]\r\n\r\n_Filling molds, pressing and dressing Edam._--The molds, which are\r\ndescribed later in detail, are well soaked in warm water previous to\r\nuse, in order to prevent too sudden chilling of curd and consequent\r\nchecking of separation of whey. As soon as whey is drawn off, as\r\nindicated above, one begins to fill the pressing molds (Fig. 27). The\r\nfilling should be done as rapidly as possible to prevent too great\r\ncooling of curd. When the curd has been put into the molds, its\r\ntemperature should not be below 88° F. Unless care is taken to keep the\r\ncurd covered, the portion that is last put into the molds may become too\r\nmuch cooled. In making Edam cheese on a small scale, it is a good plan\r\nto squeeze the moisture out with the hands as much as possible and then\r\nbreak it up again before putting in the molds, when the curd should be\r\npressed into the mold firmly by the hands. The molds should be filled as\r\nnearly alike as possible. The cheese should weigh from 5 to 5¼ pounds\r\neach when ready for the press. When the filling of molds is completed,\r\nthey are put under continual pressure of 20 to 25 pounds for about\r\ntwenty-five or thirty minutes. While the cheese is being pressed, some\r\nsweet whey is heated to a temperature of 125° or 130° F., and this whey\r\nshould not be allowed to go below 120° F. at any time while it is being\r\nused. When the cheeses are taken from their molds, each is put into the\r\nwarm whey for two minutes, then removed and dressed. For dressing Edam\r\ncheese, the ordinary cheese bandage cloth is used. This is cut into\r\nstrips, which should be long enough to reach entirely around the cheese\r\nand overlap an inch or so, and which should be wide enough to cover all\r\nbut a small portion of the ends of the cheese when put in place. Before\r\nputting on the bandage, all rough projections should be carefully pared\r\nfrom the cheese. In putting on, the cheese is held in one hand and the\r\nbandage is wrapped carefully around the cheese, so that the whole is\r\ncovered, except a small portion on the upper and lower surface of the\r\ncheese. These bare spots are covered by small pieces of bandage cloth of\r\na size sufficient to fill the bare surface. The bandage is kept wet with\r\nthe warm sweet whey, thus facilitating the process of dressing. After\r\neach cheese is dressed, it should be replaced in the dressing mold, care\r\nbeing taken that the bandage remains in place and leaves no portion of\r\nthe surface of the cheese uncovered and in direct contact with the mold.\r\nThe cheese is then put under continual pressure of 60 to 120 pounds and\r\nkept for six to twelve hours.\r\n\r\n+185. Salting and curing Edam.+--There are two methods which may be\r\nemployed in salting,--dry and wet. In dry-salting, when the cheese is\r\nfinally taken from the press, it is removed from the press mold, its\r\nbandage is removed completely, and the cheese placed in another mold,\r\nquite similar, known as the salting mold. Each cheese is placed in a\r\nsalting mold with a coating of fine salt completely surrounding it. The\r\ncheese is salted in this way once each day for five or six days. Each\r\nday the cheese should be turned when it is replaced in the mold, so that\r\nit will not be rounded on one end more than the other.\r\n\r\nIn the method of wet-salting, the cheese is placed in a tank of salt\r\nbrine, made by dissolving common salt in water in the proportion of\r\nabout 1 pound of salt to 2½ quarts of water. Each cheese is turned\r\nonce a day and should be left in the brine seven or eight days. When\r\nthe cheese is taken from the salting mold or salt bath, it is placed in\r\nwarm water and given a vigorous, thorough brushing in order to remove\r\nall slimy or greasy substances that may have accumulated on the outer\r\nsurface. When the surface is well cleansed, the cheese is carefully\r\nwiped dry with a linen towel and placed upon a shelf in the curing-room.\r\nIn being put on the shelves, the cheeses should be placed in contact so\r\nas to support one another, until they have flattened out at both ends so\r\nmuch that they can stand upright alone. Then they are moved far enough\r\napart to allow a little air space between them. Another method of\r\nsecuring the flattened ends is to support each cheese on opposite sides\r\nby wedge-shaped pieces of wood. After being placed on the shelves in the\r\ncuring-room, they are turned once a day and rubbed with the bare hand\r\nduring the first month, twice a week during the second month and once a\r\nweek after that. When any slimy substance appears on the surface of the\r\ncheese, it should be washed off at once with warm water or sweet whey.\r\nThe special conditions of the curing-room will be noticed in detail\r\nbelow. When the cheeses are about two months old, they can be prepared\r\nfor market in the following manner: They are first made smooth on the\r\nsurface by being turned in a lathe or in some other manner, after which\r\nthe surface is colored. For coloring, some carmine is dissolved in\r\nalcohol or ammonia to secure the proper shade, and in this color-bath\r\nthe cheeses are placed for about one minute, when they are removed and\r\nallowed to drain, and as soon as they are dry the outside of each cheese\r\nis rubbed with boiled linseed oil, in order to prevent checking. They\r\nare then wrapped in tin-foil, which is done very much like the\r\nbandaging. Care must be taken to put on the tin-foil so that it presents\r\na smooth, neat appearance. The cheeses are finally packed in boxes,\r\ncontaining twelve cheeses in each box, arranged in two layers of six\r\neach with a separate partition for each cheese.\r\n\r\n+186. Equipment for making Edam cheese.+--Careful attention must be\r\ngiven to the moisture and temperature of the curing-room. This room\r\nshould be well ventilated, quite moist and its temperature kept between\r\n50° and 65° F. These are conditions not easy to secure in any ordinary\r\nroom. Some form of cellar is best adapted for these conditions. The\r\namount of moisture can be determined by an instrument known as a\r\nhygrometer. In a curing-room suited for Edam cheese, the moisture should\r\nbe between 85 and 95 per cent, or a little short of saturation. When the\r\ntemperature is between 50° and 65° F., the moisture is between 85 and 95\r\nper cent if the wet-bulb thermometer is from 1 to 2° F. (or ½ to 1°\r\nC.) below the dry-bulb thermometer. Cheese will check or crack and be\r\nspoiled for market, if the degree of moisture is not kept high enough.\r\n\r\nAside from the molds, press and salting vat, the same apparatus that is\r\nused in making Cheddar can be used for Edam cheese. The pressing mold is\r\nturned preferably from white wood or, in any case, from wood that will\r\nnot taint. Each mold consists of two parts; the lower constitutes the\r\nmain part of the mold, the upper portion is simply a cover. The lower\r\nportion or body of the mold has several holes in the bottom, from which\r\nthe whey flows when the cheese is pressed. Care must be taken to prevent\r\nthese holes being stopped up by curd. This part of the mold is about six\r\ninches deep and six inches in diameter across the top. The salting mold\r\nhas no cover and the bottom is provided with only one hole for the\r\nout-flow of whey; in other respects it is much like the pressing mold.\r\n\r\n+187. Qualities and yield of Edam cheese.+--The flavor of a perfect Edam\r\ncheese is difficult to describe. It is mild, clean, and pleasantly\r\nsaline. In imperfect Edams, the flavor is more or less sour and\r\noffensive. In body, a perfect Edam cheese is solid, rather dry and mealy\r\nor crumbly. In texture, it should be close and free from pores. In the\r\nexperiments here reported the amount of fat in 100 pounds of the\r\npartially skimmed-milk varied from 2.45 to 3.20 pounds and averaged 2.77\r\npounds. Of this amount, from 0.30 to 0.51 pound of fat was lost in the\r\nwhey, with an average of 0.39 pound. The yield of cheese from 100 pounds\r\nof milk varied from 9.60 to 11.82 pounds and averaged 10.56 pounds.\r\n\r\n+188. Gouda cheese.+[86]--This Dutch variety is a sweet-curd cheese made\r\nfrom whole milk. In shape, the Gouda cheese is somewhat like a Cheddar\r\nwith the sharp edges rounded off and sloping toward the outer\r\ncircumference at the middle from the end faces. They usually weigh 10 or\r\n12 pounds, though they vary in weight from 8 to 16 pounds. They are\r\nlargely manufactured in southern Holland, and derive their name from the\r\ntown in which they were first made. Fresh sweet milk that has been\r\nproduced and cared for in the best possible manner should be used.\r\n\r\n+189. Method of manufacture.+--The processes of manufacturing Gouda\r\ncheese are as follows:\r\n\r\n_Treatment of milk before adding rennet._--The temperature of the milk\r\nshould be brought up to a point not below 88° F. nor much above 90° F.\r\nWhen the desired temperature has been reached and has become constant,\r\nthe coloring matter is added. One ounce of cheese color for about 1200\r\npounds of milk may be used. The coloring matter should be thoroughly\r\nincorporated by stirring before the rennet is added.\r\n\r\n_Addition of rennet to milk._--The rennet should not be added until the\r\nmilk has reached the desired temperature (88 to 90° F.) and this\r\ntemperature has become constant. The milk should be completely\r\ncoagulated, ready for cutting, in fifteen or twenty minutes. The same\r\nprecautions should be used in adding rennet as those previously\r\nmentioned in connection with the manufacture of Edam cheese.\r\n\r\n_Cutting the curd._--The curd should be cut when it is of about the\r\nhardness generally observed for cutting in the Cheddar process. The\r\ncutting is done as in the Cheddar process except that the curd is cut a\r\nlittle finer in the Gouda cheese. Curd should be about the size of peas\r\nor wheat kernels when ready for press and as uniform in size as\r\npossible.\r\n\r\n_Treatment of curd after cutting._--After the cutting is completed,\r\nheating and stirring is begun at once. The heating and constant stirring\r\nis continued until the curd reaches a temperature of 104° F., which\r\nshould require from thirty to forty minutes. When the curd becomes\r\nrubber-like in feeling, the whey should be run off. The whey should be\r\nentirely sweet when it is removed.\r\n\r\n_Pressing and dressing Gouda._--After the whey is off, the curd is put\r\nin molds at once without salting (Fig. 28). Pains should be taken in\r\nthis process to keep the temperature of the curd as near 100° F. as\r\npossible. Each cheese is placed under continuous pressure amounting to\r\nten or twenty times its own weight and kept for about half an hour. The\r\nfirst bandage is put on in very much the same manner as in Edam cheese\r\nmaking. The cheese is then put in press again for about one hour. The\r\nfirst bandage is then taken off and a second one like the first put on\r\nwith great care, taking pains to make the bandage smooth, capping the\r\nends as before. The cheese is then put in press again and left twelve\r\nhours or more.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 28.--Gouda cheese mold.]\r\n\r\n_Salting and curing._--When Gouda cheese is taken from the press, the\r\nbandage is removed and it is placed for twenty-four hours in a\r\ncuring-room like that used for Edam cheese, as previously described.\r\nEach cheese is then rubbed all over with dry salt until the salt begins\r\nto dissolve, and this same treatment is continued twice a day for ten\r\ndays. At the end of that time, each cheese is carefully and thoroughly\r\nwashed in warm water and dried with a clean linen towel. The cheeses are\r\nthen placed on the shelves of the curing-room, turned once a day and\r\nrubbed. The temperature and moisture are controlled as described in the\r\ncuring process of Edam cheese. If the outer surfaces of the cheese\r\nbecome slimy at any time, they are carefully washed in warm water and\r\ndried with clean towels. Under these conditions, cheese ripens in two or\r\nthree months.\r\n\r\n+190. Equipment for Gouda cheese.+--The molds, press and curing-room\r\nare the only equipment needed in the making of Gouda cheese that differ\r\nfrom that employed in making Cheddar cheese. The mold used for Gouda\r\ncheese consists of two portions, which are shown separately in Fig. 28.\r\nThese molds are made of heavy pressed tin. The inside diameter at the\r\nmiddle is about 10 inches, that of the ends about 6½ inches. The\r\nheight of the mold is about 5½ inches, and this represents the\r\nthickness of the cheese, but by pushing the upper down into the lower\r\nportion, the thickness can be decreased as desired.\r\n\r\n+191. Composition and yield of Gouda.+--In work with milk averaging 4.2\r\nper cent of fat there were lost in the whey from 0.29 to 0.43 per cent\r\nwith an average of 0.35 per cent of fat. The loss of fat appears to be\r\nnot much greater than the average loss met with in cheese factories in\r\nmaking Cheddar cheese. From 100 pounds of milk, there were made from\r\n11.60 to 13.35 pounds of green cheese, with an average of 12.50 pounds.\r\nThe percentage of water in the experimental cheese varied from 41.25 to\r\n45.43 per cent and averaged 43.50 per cent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\n_CHEDDAR CHEESE-MAKING_\r\n\r\n\r\nCheddar is the best known cheese throughout the United States and the\r\none most commonly made in factories. The Cheddar process was brought to\r\nAmerica by English immigrants. Similar to Cheddar cheese are Pineapple,\r\nEnglish Dairy, Sage cheese, skimmed-milk and California Jack cheese made\r\nin this country, and Derbyshire, Leicestershire, Wensleydale and\r\nCheshire made in England. The Cheddar cheese process as employed in the\r\nfactories to-day has been modified and improved since it was first\r\nintroduced into this country by the early immigrants. The following\r\ndescription[87] includes only the practices as found in the factories\r\nto-day if whole milk is used. Skimmed-milk Cheddar cheese is discussed\r\nlater.\r\n\r\n+192. The lot-card.+--The Cheddar process involves several hours of\r\nmanipulation and includes many details which should be closely and\r\naccurately observed and recorded. The necessity of carrying observations\r\nof several different factors at the same time makes a scheme of\r\nrecording data essential to convenient work. For this purpose, a\r\nlot-card for Cheddar cheese is introduced here and the pages given to\r\nparticular factors are indicated in the space intended for the recording\r\nof observations. The manufacture of Cheddar cheese is a complicated\r\nprocess, because several factors must be given attention at the same\r\ntime. A careful record of the observations of each step in the\r\nsuccessive handling of each lot of milk puts the operator in possession\r\nof a permanent record of his experience. This record has several uses.\r\nIt may help to convince patrons of the importance of eliminating faults\r\nin the milk; it furnishes the cheese-maker a cumulative record of his\r\nexperiences in handling milk with special qualities, such as high or low\r\nfat-content, over-acidity or taints. Since Cheddar ripening covers a\r\nperiod of weeks and months, no operator can remember particular lots of\r\nmilk sufficiently well to be able to use his experience on the\r\ninterpretation of the qualities found in the ripened product.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 29.--Delivering milk to the cheese factory.]\r\n\r\n+193. The milk.+--It is the usual practice to deliver the milk to the\r\ncheese factory each morning (Fig. 29). The night's milk is cooled and\r\nkept clean and cold until delivered at the factory. It is advisable not\r\nto mix the cold night's milk and the warm morning's milk, but to deliver\r\nthem in separate cans to the cheese factory at the same time. The milk\r\nis weighed, sample for fat test taken and then run into the vat (Fig.\r\n30). The receiving or taking in of the milk is one of the most important\r\nparts of the cheese factory work. It is practically as important as the\r\nactual manufacturing of the cheese.\r\n\r\n  +21 CHEESE.+ This card must remain with lot ........... from the milk room\r\n  until the finished product is ready to leave the building, then it should\r\n  be handed to instructor.\r\n\r\n  +MAKING+ Day and Date ................................

W. Hall.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 30.--Receiving, sampling, weighing and running the\r\nmilk into the cheese vat.]\r\n\r\nAny milk high in acid or with a bad flavor should be avoided. It is\r\noften bad policy to reject the milk, for a neighboring factory will\r\naccept it and the factory not only loses the milk but also the patron.\r\nFactories should have an agreement to prevent this. The acidity can be\r\ndetermined by the acid test, but the detection of flavors must be made\r\nby the cheese-maker himself with the aid of smell and taste. Many of\r\nthe bad flavors in the cheese can be traced to the poor quality of the\r\nmilk. One of the worst qualities in milk and cheese is the presence of\r\ngas-producing organisms.[88] Any milk which shows gassy fermentation\r\nshould be rejected, for it is difficult to make cheese from this and at\r\nbest there will be a large loss during the manufacturing process. The\r\ncheese may have a bad flavor and develop \"pin-holes\" and in extreme\r\ncases may puff up like a ball. The person receiving the milk should talk\r\nto the farmers or dairy-men about the proper care of the utensils and\r\nmilk. He must see that the cans are kept clean. One very bad practice is\r\nto deliver milk and take home whey in the same cans. The cans, as they\r\nare brought back from the cheese factory full of whey, are often left in\r\nthe barn or near a hog-pen until the whey is fed. Unless such cans are\r\nemptied immediately on returning to the farm and then rinsed out with\r\ncold water, thoroughly washed and scalded, bad flavors may develop in\r\nthe cheese. It is thought that this causes \"fruity\" or sweet flavor,\r\nwhich resembles that of fruits such as raspberries, strawberries or\r\npineapples.\r\n\r\n+194. Ripening the milk.+--A slight development of acidity is required:\r\n(_a_) to obtain the formation of a firm curd; and (_b_) to establish\r\nimmediate dominance of a desirable type of lactic organism which will\r\nproduce the large amount of acid required later in the cheddaring\r\nprocess. The development of this acidification before the addition of\r\nrennet is known as the ripening of the milk. The extent of ripening\r\nadvised by different schools of makers has varied from an acidity of\r\n0.20 of 1 per cent or even slightly higher percentage titrated as lactic\r\nacid, to about 0.17 of 1 per cent as now preferred by some of the most\r\nsuccessful groups of workers. The ripeness of the milk can also be\r\ndetermined by the use of the rennet test.\r\n\r\nThe milk may be ripened by allowing the lactic organisms already present\r\nin the milk to develop naturally. This requires considerable time and\r\nwhile the lactic acid-forming bacteria are developing, other and\r\nundesirable fermentations may be taking place, so that the good results\r\nwhich should follow the uninterrupted development of the lactic\r\nacid-forming organisms are lost. Starter is commonly used to produce the\r\ndesired ripening of the milk. (For the preparation of starter see\r\nChapter IV.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 31.--Steel cheese vat.]\r\n\r\nSome makers put the starter into the empty vat (Fig. 31) and add the\r\nmilk as it is received; others add it to the total volume of cold milk\r\nand then begin to heat it. Whenever the starter is used, it should be\r\nstrained to remove lumps. These lumps might cause a mottled color in the\r\ncheese. The best practice calls for an acidity or a rennet test of the\r\nmixed milk after it has been brought to the setting temperature in the\r\nvat. With milk tested at this stage and the volume of milk in the vat\r\nknown, the cheese-maker is able to calculate closely the amount of\r\nstarter needed. When the quantity of starter to use is in doubt, the\r\namount added should be under rather than over the estimate, since the\r\nneed of more can be determined by making frequent rennet and acid tests\r\nin a very few minutes without damage to the cheese. If too much starter\r\nhas been used, acid or sour cheese is usually obtained, with loss in\r\nmarket quality.\r\n\r\nAn over-development of acidity at any stage of the manufacturing process\r\naffects the flavor, body and texture, color and finish of the cheese.\r\nThe product is known as a sour cheese, and can usually be identified by\r\nits sour taste and smell. A sour cheese while curing will seldom develop\r\na normal Cheddar flavor and the texture will be hard and harsh and very\r\nbrittle. The body will not be smooth but harsh and grainy. The\r\nover-development of acid will show by fading or bleaching the color. A\r\nsour cheese usually leaks whey for a few days after being placed on the\r\ncuring-room shelves.\r\n\r\nRipening the milk is one of the most important parts of cheese-making.\r\nProper ripening places the acid fermentations under the control of the\r\ncheese-maker so that he may know what results will follow his labors.\r\nThe operator can control the acidity while ripening the milk, but after\r\nthe rennet is added all control of the acidity is lost. From that time,\r\nthe moisture must be regulated in proportion to the acidity.\r\n\r\nBefore setting, the milk should be ripened to such a point as to leave\r\nat least two and one-half hours from the time that the rennet extract is\r\nadded until the acid development has reached the stage at which it is\r\nnecessary to remove the whey. By the acid test the milk may vary from\r\n0.16 to 0.18 of 1 per cent, but no definite statement can be given for\r\nthe rennet test. This can be determined only by comparison from day to\r\nday. For operation of rennet test see Chapter V. During this period of\r\ntwo and one-half hours, the curd is formed, then cut, and the\r\ntemperature is raised from 84° or 86° F. (the temperature at which the\r\nrennet extract is added) to about 98° to 100° F. The curd must be kept\r\nagitated so that the particles will not mat together; this is necessary\r\nto obtain sufficient contraction of the particles of curd with the\r\nproper reduction of water-content. If the milk becomes too ripe (too\r\nsour) before the rennet is added, there will not be sufficient time for\r\nthese steps to take place naturally. In such cases special means are\r\nrequired to firm the curd. These result in a loss of both quality and\r\nquantity of cheese. On the other hand, if the milk is not ripened, but\r\nthe rennet extract added, regardless of the acid development, one of the\r\nimportant natural forces for expelling the moisture is lost. The time\r\nrequired for the particles of curd to contract is much prolonged, the\r\nexpulsion of whey is usually inadequate and the curd remains in a soft\r\nor wet condition. Using too much starter is almost equally bad, for\r\nalthough it hastens the making process, it produces a sour or acid\r\ncheese.\r\n\r\n+195. Setting or coagulating.+--The milk for Cheddar cheese-making is\r\nheated to 86° to 88° F. or occasionally a slightly lower temperature.\r\nThis temperature is found by experiment to give the texture of curd most\r\nfavorable for the desired results. Although some cheese-makers work as\r\nlow as 84° F., the texture of such curd is too soft and coagulates too\r\nslowly. The very slight change of 2° F. produces curd which coagulates\r\nmore quickly and is tougher and firmer.\r\n\r\nIf the cheeses are to be colored, the color should be added after all\r\nthe starter. It should be thoroughly and evenly mixed with the milk to\r\ninsure an even color in the cheese. If the color is added before the\r\nstarter, there are likely to be white specks in the cheese, on account\r\nof the coagulated casein in the starter. The amount of color to use\r\ndepends on the tint desired in the cheese. It varies from 1/3 to ½\r\nounce to 1000 pounds of milk for a light straw color to 1½ to 2\r\nounces for 1000 pounds of milk for a deep red color.\r\n\r\nEnough rennet should be used to produce a curd firm enough to cut in\r\ntwenty-five to thirty-five minutes. The necessary amount will vary with\r\nthe strength of the rennet extract itself, with the acidity, the\r\ntemperature, the nature of the lot of milk, and with the individual aims\r\nof the maker in which he adjusts the other factors to his preferences as\r\nto rapidity of rennet action. With the usual commercial extract, the\r\nneeded amount ranges from 2.5 to 4 ounces for 1000 pounds of milk. As\r\nfor all varieties of cheese, the rennet extract should be diluted in\r\ncold water at about one part rennet to forty parts water and thoroughly\r\nstirred into the milk. (See Chapter V.)\r\n\r\n+196. Cutting.+--The object of cutting is to obtain an even expulsion of\r\nthe moisture from the curd. The curd is cut as soon as it becomes firm\r\nenough. To determine this, various tests may be used. Some operators\r\ntest it by pressing it away from the side of the vat, considering it\r\nready to cut when it separates cleanly from the metal. The test most\r\ncommonly used is to insert the index finger obliquely into the curd,\r\nthen to start to split the curd with the thumb and finally to raise the\r\nfinger gently; if ready to cut, the curd will split cleanly over the\r\nfinger and clear whey will separate to fill the opened crack. Another\r\narbitrary but more or less satisfactory rule is that the time from\r\nadding the rennet until cutting should be two and one-half times that\r\nfrom the addition of rennet until the first sign of coagulation is\r\nobserved.\r\n\r\nThe condition of the curd itself is the best guide to show when it is\r\nready to cut. The condition of the curd is constantly changing, so that\r\nin a large vat, if the cutting is not begun until the curd is in the\r\nbest condition, by the time the last of the curd is cut it will be too\r\nhard or firm. It is better to begin while the curd is a trifle too soft\r\nso that the cutting will be taking place while the curd is at the proper\r\nstage. At best the last of the curd may become too hard. If too hard, it\r\nwill break ahead of the knife instead of cut. Breaking causes more fat\r\nloss than cutting because there is more surface exposed and hence more\r\nfat globules. The softer the curd when cut, the quicker and easier the\r\nmoisture can be expelled.\r\n\r\nIf the curd is cut when soft, care must be exercised not to stir it too\r\nhard immediately after cutting. Soft curd breaks very easily. When the\r\ncurd is cut soft and then stirred vigorously, there is a larger loss of\r\nfat than when the curd becomes hard before it is cut.\r\n\r\nTwo knives are used to cut the curd. (See Fig. 11.) These knives may\r\nhave either wire or blades for cutting. The space between the wires or\r\nblades varies from 5/16 to ½ inch. Knives used should have blades or\r\nwires close enough together to cut the pieces as small as desired,\r\nwithout a second cutting. When the curd has to be cut a second time it\r\nusually results in pieces of uneven sizes, because the pieces already\r\ncut cannot be evenly split in two.\r\n\r\nOne set of knives has horizontal and the other perpendicular blades or\r\nwires. The curd is cut the long way of the vat with the horizontal knife\r\nand lengthwise and crosswise with the perpendicular knife so that the\r\nresult is small cubes or oblongs of curd. Some cheese-makers prefer to\r\nuse one knife first and some the other, but the result should be a curd\r\ncut into pieces of uniform size. The smaller the particles of curd or\r\ncubes are cut, the quicker the curd will firm up or cook. If not cut\r\nuniformly, the changes taking place later in the curd particles will not\r\nbe uniform,--the small pieces will be hard and dry while the large ones\r\nwill be soft and mushy.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 32.--The proper way to put the knife into the curd.]\r\n\r\nCare should be taken to let the knife cut its way into the curd (Fig.\r\n32). If the knife is pushed into the curd, it will break it and cause a\r\nlarge loss of fat. The same is true when taking the knives out of the\r\ncurd. The loss of fat due to cutting is very similar to the loss of\r\nsawdust when sawing a board. It may be considered a necessary evil. The\r\nloss due to cutting is about 0.3 of 1 per cent of fat in the whey and\r\nthe loss of casein about 0.1 of 1 per cent in the whey.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 33.--Acme curd rake.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 34.--McPherson curd agitator.]\r\n\r\n+197. Heating or \"cooking\" the curd.+--After the curd is cut, the pieces\r\n(cubes) rapidly settle to the bottom of the vat and tend to mat\r\ntogether. To prevent this, the curd must be kept stirred. When stirring\r\nfirst begins, the curd is soft and very readily broken. Some\r\ncheese-makers prefer to stir by hand for the first few minutes after\r\ncutting, while the curd is soft. The importance of careful handling can\r\nhardly be over-emphasized. No matter how well the curd has been cut, if\r\nthe stirring is performed in a careless manner in the early stages, it\r\nwill be broken into uneven sized pieces and a considerable loss of fat\r\nwill result. A wooden hay rake or a McPherson curd agitator (Figs. 33,\r\n34) may be used to stir the curd. Mechanical curd agitators are used in\r\nsome cheese factories. There are several makes. (See Fig. 35.) These\r\nagitators save much hand labor, although some stirring by hand must be\r\ndone in connection with them. The mechanical agitators do not stir the\r\ncurd in the corners of the vat; this must be done with the hand rake. It\r\nis the usual practice to stir the curd immediately after cutting for\r\nfive to ten minutes before the mechanical agitators are used. This is\r\nnecessary to give the curd a slight chance to firm as the mechanical\r\nagitators tend to break it up. After cutting, a thin film forms on each\r\npiece of curd. This film holds the curd particles, especially the fat.\r\nBreaking the films on the cubes causes loss of fat. If lumps form at\r\nthe early stage, by matting of the curd particles, violent stirring is\r\nrequired to separate them. When such lumps are broken up, new cleavage\r\nlines are formed with loss of fat, because the original films\r\nsurrounding the soft curd fuse so firmly that the curd cubes do not\r\nseparate but actually break. New surfaces are thus formed with\r\nconsequent fat loss. Rapid shrinkage with expulsion of whey takes place\r\nduring the first few minutes of gentle agitation. Before any heat is\r\napplied to the vat, sufficient whey should have separated or formed to\r\nfloat each piece of curd separately. This will require ten to fifteen\r\nminutes from the time of cutting.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 35.--Two types of mechanical curd agitators.]\r\n\r\nThus far the first of three distinct factors which expel the moisture\r\nfrom the curd has been considered: (1) the action of the rennet; (2) the\r\ndevelopment of the lactic acid; and (3) the application of heat. These\r\nforces must have time to act naturally. If heat is applied too soon\r\nafter the curd is cut or if the temperature is raised too rapidly, it\r\ncauses a thick film to form on the pieces of curd which interferes with\r\nthe escape of the whey. The outside of the curd becomes firm but the\r\ninside remains very soft. A curd which is cooked on the outside only\r\nfeels firm when stirred by hand in the whey, but when a handful is\r\nsqueezed the soft centers are noticed. To firm such curd masses requires\r\nviolent stirring, which will break the thick tough film. This allows the\r\nmoisture to escape and also increases the fat loss. The rapidity of\r\nheating should depend on the condition of the curd and the amount of\r\nacid developed. The heat should keep pace with these. When ready to\r\nraise the temperature, the least amount of steam possible should be\r\nallowed to pass through the valve. This should raise the temperature\r\nvery gradually. If heat is applied too quickly at first, it will cause\r\nthe curd to lump. A safe rule is to raise the temperature one degree in\r\nthe first five minutes after the steam has been turned on. The heating\r\nshould progress slowly until the whole mass of curd in the vat has\r\nreached a temperature of 90° to 92° F. The usual temperature to which\r\nthe curd is heated or cooked is 98° F. to 100° F. The lower the\r\ntemperature that can be used and properly firm the curd, the better will\r\nbe the body of the cheese. If the curd is heated too high, it will\r\nbecome hard, which causes a dry hard \"corky\" cheese. After this\r\ntemperature has been reached, there is not such a tendency for the curd\r\nparticles to stick together nor are they so easily broken in stirring.\r\nIt should require, under normal conditions, not less than thirty to\r\nforty-five minutes, from the time the steam is turned on, to raise\r\ntemperature of the curd from the setting temperature to that necessary\r\nto \"firm\" the curd. If a shorter time is allowed to raise the\r\ntemperature, the curd will not have opportunity to contract naturally.\r\n\r\nThe temperature required to expel the moisture properly varies with the\r\npercentage of fat in the milk. If rich in fat (4.5 to 5.5 per cent) milk\r\nrequires a temperature of 98° to 104° F. to firm the curd, while the\r\nsame result can be accomplished with milk testing 3.0 to 3.5 per cent\r\nfat at a temperature of 94° to 96° F. A higher temperature is needed in\r\nwinter than in summer because the milk is usually richer in fat. In a\r\nwater-jacketed vat, allowance must always be made for the rise in\r\ntemperature due to the water surrounding it. The water may be removed if\r\nthere is danger of the temperature going too high. However, it is better\r\nto gauge the heat so that the water may be left, as this helps to hold\r\nthe curd at an even temperature, especially in cold weather. In a\r\nsteam-heated vat there is not so much danger of the temperature running\r\nup.\r\n\r\nThe stirring must be kept up after the steam has been turned off until\r\nthe curd has reached such a stage of contraction that it will not\r\nreadily pack or mat in the bottom of the vat. After the curd reaches\r\nthis stage it may be allowed to settle to the bottom and stirred only\r\noccasionally until it is time to remove the whey. If the cheese room is\r\nnot warm and there is danger of the curd cooling, a cover should be\r\nplaced on the vat. The curd should not be allowed to settle for more\r\nthan fifteen minutes without stirring to keep each piece separate. This\r\nis necessary to obtain uniform contraction of all curd masses.\r\n\r\n+198. Removing the whey.+--To permit the normal changes in the curd to\r\ntake place naturally, two and one-half hours from the time the rennet\r\nextract is added is ordinarily required before the whey is drawn. The\r\ntime of removing the whey is determined by two factors: one, the acid\r\ndevelopment, and the other, the firmness of the curd. For the best\r\nresults, it is better to have the firmness of the curd a trifle ahead of\r\nthe acid development. When the proper acid development has been reached,\r\nthe whey must be removed, regardless of the firmness of the curd. If the\r\ncurd has not become firm enough by natural forces, when the acid\r\ndevelopment has reached the proper stage to remove the whey, it must be\r\nfirmed by other means. If it is not firm enough, either by natural or\r\nartificial means, when the whey is removed, a sour cheese is the result.\r\nThe acid development should not be allowed to go beyond 0.16 to 0.19 of\r\n1 per cent acidity in the whey by the acid test or 1/16 to 1/8 of an\r\ninch of acid on the hot-iron test, before the whey is removed.\r\n\r\n+199. Hot-iron test.+[89]--This test is employed to determine the amount\r\nof acid in the curd. A piece of iron, such as an iron pipe two feet\r\nlong, is heated in the fire to proper temperature. If the iron is too\r\nhot it will burn the curd, and if not hot enough the curd will not stick\r\nto the iron. When hot, it is taken from the fire and wiped clean with a\r\ncloth. A handful of curd is taken from the vat and squeezed dry, either\r\nin the hand or in a cloth. This curd is carefully pressed against the\r\nhot iron and drawn away. If the iron is at the right temperature and the\r\ncurd has sufficient acid development, the curd will stick to the iron\r\nand when pulled away will form fine threads. The length of these threads\r\ndetermines the amount of acid in the curd. The acid is usually spoken of\r\nin terms of the length of threads, as 1/8 inch of acid, ½ inch of acid\r\nand the like. The curd must have a slight development of acid before it\r\nwill stick to the iron. This test takes advantage of the peculiar\r\nproperties[90] of curd which are produced by the action of the acid on\r\nthe casein.\r\n\r\n+200. Firmness of the curd.+--The cheese-maker must be able to judge the\r\nfirmness of the curd by physical examination. The particles of curd\r\nshould have shrunken to about one-half their original size and should be\r\nof uniform consistency throughout; they should not have any soft\r\ncenters. The curd should be firm and springy. When a double handful is\r\npressed and suddenly released, the curd particles should spring apart.\r\nThe curd should have a \"shotty\" feeling when in the whey. If the curd\r\nhas attained the proper firmness, and the acid has not reached the\r\ncorrect stage to remove the whey, it may be left in the whey until\r\nsufficient acid development has been attained. This is liable to cause\r\nthe curd to become too firm and to result in a hard dry cheese. If there\r\nis no evidence of the presence of undesirable organisms, such as bad\r\nodors, or gas holes in the curd, it is better to remove the whey and\r\ndevelop the acid when the curd is in the \"pack.\" The pack refers to the\r\nfirst piling of the curd.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 36.--Whey siphon with strainer.]\r\n\r\nThe whey may be removed either by means of a faucet or gate in the vat\r\nor by a siphon (Fig. 36). With either form of removal a whey-strainer\r\n(Fig. 37) should be used to prevent loss of curd particles. It requires\r\nconsiderable time for the whey to escape from a large vat. After the\r\ncurd has been heated to the proper temperature, it is well to remove a\r\nportion of the whey. In doing this the surface of the whey should not be\r\ndrawn down quite to the top of the curd. When ready, the remaining whey\r\ncan be quickly removed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 37.--Whey strainer with spout to fit into the gate\r\nin the vat.]\r\n\r\nIf it is decided that the curd is not firm enough, when the whey is\r\ndrawn down to the surface of the curd and the acid has developed\r\nsufficiently, the curd should be firmed up in the whey by stirring it\r\nvigorously by hand before the remainder of the whey is removed. This is\r\ncommonly called \"hand stirring.\" This difficulty results either from the\r\nuse of too much starter or from holding the milk until too much acid\r\ndevelopment has taken place before adding the rennet. Hand stirring\r\naccomplishes what natural forces would accomplish if given sufficient\r\ntime. If the curd does not firm naturally in the whey, there is a large\r\nloss of fat and other solids, because the pieces of curd will have to be\r\nbroken up to allow the water to escape from the soft centers of these\r\nmasses. This loss can usually be reduced by firming the curd in the whey\r\nor adding water rather than by stirring without either water or whey. If\r\nthe curd is not properly firmed, it carries extra whey into the cheese.\r\nWith the increase in whey, the amount of milk-sugar carried into the\r\ncheese increases. This extra milk-sugar attacked by bacteria produces an\r\nexcess of lactic acid, which results in \"sour\" cheeses. This explains\r\nwhy the curd is placed beyond the danger of over-development of acid by\r\nremoving so large a portion of the whey. If the curd is properly firmed\r\nin the whey and the whey is removed before too much acid has developed,\r\nit is impossible to make a sour cheese.\r\n\r\n+201. Gathering the curd together.+--Before the last of the whey has\r\nbeen removed, the curd should be pushed back from the faucet into the\r\nupper two-thirds of the vat and spread in an even layer. This layer\r\nshould be six to eight inches thick. The curd can be pushed back with\r\nthe rake or a board which will fit crosswise in the vat, in which are\r\nmany holes. As soon as the whey has been removed so that there is not\r\nenough to wash the curd into the lower part of the vat, the vat should\r\nbe tilted and a ditch eight to ten inches wide cut in the curd through\r\nthe center. The curd from the ditch should be removed to either side and\r\nspread evenly. As soon as all the whey has been removed, the pieces of\r\ncurd scattered about in the vat should be gathered up and placed with\r\nthe remainder.\r\n\r\nIn some factories, instead of matting the curd in the vat, a curd sink\r\nis used. This is a wooden receptacle about the size of the vat but not\r\nso deep, with a slatted false bottom. It is fitted with castors so that\r\nit can be easily moved about. A cloth is placed in the sink and the curd\r\nand whey are dipped upon the cloth. The whey escapes very rapidly\r\nthrough the cloth. The curd sink is an advantage in those cases in which\r\nit is desirable to remove the whey from the curd quickly, such as high\r\nacid curds which have to be hand stirred to firm the curd. The\r\ndisadvantage lies in the work required to keep the sink and the large\r\ncloth clean.\r\n\r\n+202. Matting or cheddaring+ is the distinctive feature of the Cheddar\r\nprocess. It is the piling and matting of the curd. Whether the curd is\r\nmatted in the vat or in the curd sink, the process is practically the\r\nsame. The object of cheddaring is three-fold: (1) to control the\r\nincorporation of moisture; (2) to control undesirable ferments, if\r\npresent in the curd; (3) to develop the texture desired in the cheeses.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 38.--A cheese knife.]\r\n\r\nAfter the curd in the vat has become matted so that the particles stick\r\ntogether, the masses on either side of the central channel are cut\r\ncrosswise into strips with a cheese knife (Fig. 38). The width of the\r\nstrip depends on the water-content of the curd at this stage. The more\r\nwater, the smaller should be the pieces of curd. This allows the whey to\r\ndrain away much more rapidly. As soon as the strips of curd are cut,\r\nthey should be turned over or stood on edge. A drain should be left\r\nalong the middle line of the vat and on each side. This permits the whey\r\nto run away freely. If, on the other hand, the outlet is dammed up, the\r\ncurd may become \"whey-soaked.\" This produces a soft mushy cheese which\r\nsometimes is \"acidy\" or sour. After the curd is turned each time, all\r\ncrumbs of curd broken off should be brushed underneath the masses of\r\ncurd so that they will mat with it. They should never be placed on top\r\nof the curd because they will not unite but will become dry and hard. If\r\nthe crumbs are not kept brushed up, they become dry and will cause an\r\nopen textured granular cheese and possibly lumps in the cheese. After\r\nthe pieces of curd have been turned several times, and the whey has\r\nfairly completely drained away, they may be piled first two deep, then\r\nthree deep and so on, the depth of the piling being gauged by the\r\nsoftness or amount of water in the curd and the temperature. The higher\r\nthe curd is piled, the more water it will retain (assimilate), so that\r\nthe amount of moisture in the curd is regulated by the size of the\r\npieces into which it is cut and the rapidity and depth to which it is\r\npiled.\r\n\r\nThe curd should not be left too long from the time it is turned until it\r\nis turned again. This period is usually about ten to fifteen minutes.\r\nThe moister the curd, the more often it should be turned. In turning,\r\ncare should be taken to keep the ends at the same temperature as the\r\nremainder. This can be done by piling them inside, thereby keeping them\r\nwarm. There is a tendency for the ends of the pieces of curd to remain\r\ngranular and so cause an open-textured cheese.\r\n\r\nDuring the cheddaring process, the temperature should be reduced\r\nuniformly and gradually. If there is danger of the curd becoming too\r\ncold, the vat should be covered and a pail of hot water may be placed\r\ninside, if it is deemed necessary. The temperature of the curd should\r\nnot be allowed to go below 85° to 90° F. If kept too warm, the curd will\r\nbecome soft and plastic, and if too cold, it will not mat together.\r\n\r\nWhile the curd is being turned and piled, its physical properties are\r\nchanging. The acid develops. When the cheddaring process is completed,\r\nthe curd should be elastic, smooth and fibrous. The curd should have the\r\nclose meaty texture desired in the cheese. If this step in the process\r\nis neglected, defects may appear later in the body, texture and flavor\r\nof the cheese. Attempts to pile the curd too fast result in a soft,\r\nmushy, open-textured product. Such cheese has mechanical holes, in which\r\nmoisture collects, and so is likely to cause rot while curing.\r\n\r\nIf gas is detected either before or during the cheddaring process, the\r\ncurd should be piled until the gas holes are no longer round but flat.\r\nIf the gas holes are not flattened or obliterated during this process,\r\nthe cheeses will be very liable to puff on the shelves in the\r\ncuring-room. The curd should be handled until the gas holes flatten out\r\nevenly, although this may require considerable time. At best, gassy curd\r\nwill never produce the highest grade of cheese.\r\n\r\nCheddaring or piling the curd is not thoroughly understood by most\r\ncheese-makers. Because the moisture contains the milk-sugar, there is\r\ndanger of having so much moisture present in the cheese that it will\r\nbecome sour from the action of the lactic acid-forming bacteria on the\r\nmilk-sugar. A cheese may be sweet when made and later become sour\r\nbecause it contains too much moisture or milk-sugar. This is known as\r\n\"shelf souring.\" For the proper cheddaring of a curd, it is necessary\r\nthat it be properly firmed in the whey. If the moisture is not evenly\r\nincorporated, the cheese will have a mottled color. The pieces that have\r\nthe more moisture will be lighter colored. If the proper amount of\r\nmoisture is not incorporated, the cheese will be dry and hard, and if\r\ntoo much, soft and pasty.\r\n\r\n+203. Milling the curd.+--The large pieces formed by the cheddaring\r\nprocess must be cut into small ones before the curd can be easily put\r\ninto the hoop. This is called \"milling.\" Properly milled curd can be\r\nsalted evenly, cools more quickly and uniformly and can be distributed\r\nevenly in the hoops.\r\n\r\nThe proper time to \"mill\" the curd is determined by its physical\r\ncondition. Some curds will cheddar much more rapidly than others, hence\r\nno definite length of time can be given. Curd, when ready to mill,\r\nshould have a fibrous texture somewhat like the white meat of a chicken\r\nbreast. The pieces of curd should split very easily. When cut, the curd\r\nshould show a close, solid, smooth interior. The amount of lactic acid\r\ndeveloped may vary within rather wide limits. The hot iron may show\r\nstrings ½ to 1 inch long. The acidity (by titration of the freshly\r\nseparating whey) may be 0.45 to 0.65 of 1 per cent. If the curd has been\r\nproperly made, that is, firmed up in the whey with the proper acidity so\r\nfar, acid development during the cheddaring process will take care of\r\nitself. The physical condition remains the principal means of\r\ndetermining the time when the curd should be milled.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 39.--Gosselin curd-mill.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 40.--Barnard curd-mill.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 41.--Junker curd-mill.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 42.--Harris curd-mill.]\r\n\r\nThere are many kinds and styles of curd-mills on the market. Gosselin,\r\nBarnard, Pohl, Junker, Victor, Harris are well-known kinds (Figs.\r\n39-42). Some are hand, others power mills. Some of these tear the curd\r\ninto pieces of unequal size, others cut it into uniform pieces. A mill\r\nthat will do the work with the least possible pressure on the curd and\r\nwhich will cut it into small uniform-sized pieces is most desirable. The\r\nideal mill should release the least fat and leave the curd in the best\r\ncondition to receive the salt. It is impossible to run curd through any\r\nmill without exposing some fat on the freshly cut surfaces, and if the\r\ncurd is put under pressure, more fat will be pressed out and lost.\r\nCutting in the mill, like cutting the curd after coagulation by rennet,\r\nmay be called a necessary evil. There is an unavoidable mechanical loss\r\nwhich may be greater or less according to the mill used. If the curd has\r\nbeen properly handled so that the water in it has become thoroughly\r\nassimilated (properly incorporated), this loss will be reduced to the\r\nminimum. If the curd contains free moisture and many of the particles\r\nhave soft interiors, a stream of white whey will run down the vat as the\r\ncurd masses are cut. Some samples of such white whey will test as high\r\nas 15 per cent fat. This not only causes a loss in yield but in quality\r\nof cheese, according to the amount of fat lost. White whey is an\r\nindication of loss of fat. If the proper amount of moisture is present\r\nand is so thoroughly incorporated in the curd that it can be separated\r\nonly by evaporation, the ideal condition has been reached. While\r\nmilling, the cut curd should be stirred as fast as milled to prevent\r\nmatting again and to allow odors to escape. This stirring is usually\r\nperformed with a curd fork (Fig. 43). At the same time the temperature\r\nwill be lowered. The milled curd should be spread evenly over the upper\r\nthree-quarters of the bottom of the vat. The flavor of the curd that has\r\nbeen made from tainted milk can be very much improved by stirring at\r\nthis time so that air can enter.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 43.--A curd fork.]\r\n\r\nA gassy curd, which has been held until the holes have become flattened,\r\nshould be stirred very frequently during this stage to allow the gas to\r\nescape, thereby improving the flavor.\r\n\r\n+204. Salting.+--Salt is added to Cheddar curd for several purposes: (1)\r\nfor its taste; (2) to aid in the removal of the whey and to harden and\r\nshrink the curd; (3) to influence the fermentation by slowing down\r\nacidification, checking the growth of unfavorable organisms and delaying\r\nripening. The salt should be pure. It should be coarse-grained, because\r\nthe large grains dissolve more slowly and permit its absorption to a\r\nmuch larger extent than the fine-grained salt. Salt that dissolves\r\nslowly is, therefore, to be sought for this purpose.\r\n\r\nThe following factors must be considered in determining the amount of\r\nsalt to be used: (1) the amount of curd from the milk; (2) the\r\npercentage of water in the curd; (3) the acidity of the curd; (4) the\r\nparticular market form of cheese desired. The custom of determining the\r\nquantity of salt by the weight of milk is an inaccurate practice. The\r\namount of salt should be based on the amount of curd. If the amount of\r\nfat in the milk is known, a fairly accurate estimate of the amount of\r\ncurd can be made. It would be more accurate to weigh the curd before\r\nsalting, but this is not practicable or necessary to insure a good\r\nquality of cheese. The amount of salt varies from 1½ to 2½ pounds\r\nof salt to the curd from each 1000 pounds of milk.\r\n\r\nThe salt should not be added directly after milling because, at that\r\ntime, it would cause a large loss of fat. After milling there should be\r\ntime before salting for the freshly cut surfaces to dry or \"heal over.\"\r\nWhen first milled the curd has a dry harsh feeling; when ready to salt\r\nit will feel soft and mellow and some moisture can usually be squeezed\r\nout easily. Fifteen to twenty minutes from the time of milling are\r\nrequired before the curd is ready for the salt. When ready, the curd\r\nshould be spread evenly over the bottom of the vat. The salt should be\r\ncarefully weighed, and then applied, evenly, over the surface of the\r\ncurd, in two or three applications. The curd should be thoroughly\r\nstirred after each application of salt. While the salt is being\r\ndissolved and absorbed, the curd should be stirred occasionally to\r\nprevent lumps from forming.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 44.--Wilson press hoop. _A_, complete hoop; _B_,\r\nbottom cover with wide flange; _C_, top cover with narrow flange; _D_,\r\nclosed body; _E_, bandager.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 45.--Fraser press hoop. _A_, complete hoop; _B_,\r\nbandager; _C_, follower; _D_, fibrous press ring.]\r\n\r\n+205. Hooping the curd.+--When the salt has become dissolved and the\r\ncurd as soft and mellow as before the salt was added, it is ready to be\r\nput into the hoop. Various sized hoops may be used, depending on the\r\ndesired size of the cheese. Two types are the Wilson and the Fraser\r\n(Figs. 44, 45). With either type, a dampened press cloth should be cut\r\njust to fit the bottom of the hoop. A starched circle may or may not be\r\nused; if used, it should be placed on top of the press cloth. The\r\nbandage now commonly employed is the seamless one which comes in the\r\nform of a tube of various sizes for different sized hoops. The lengths\r\nof bandage cut for each hoop or cheese depend on the height of the\r\ncheese plus about one and one-half inches' lap on each end. The bandage,\r\nafter being cut the desired length, is placed on the part of the hoop\r\nmade to hold it, so that it is suspended about the side of the hoop and\r\nlaps about one and one-half inches on the bottom. The bandage should be\r\nfree from ravelings and placed squarely in the hoop.\r\n\r\nThe hoop is now ready to fill with curd. Enough hoops should be prepared\r\nto hold all the day's curd as fast as it is ready. In order to have all\r\nthe cheeses as nearly as possible of the same size, it is advisable to\r\nweigh the curd into the hoops. The curd may be measured into the hoops,\r\nbut this is not so accurate. The curd may be dipped with a flat-sided\r\ncurd pail or a curd scoop into the hoops (Fig. 46).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 46.--Curd scoop and pail.]\r\n\r\n+206. Pressing the curd.+--The natural changes sought in the curd\r\nrequire a period of at least five hours between the time of setting\r\n(addition of the rennet) and the pressing of the curd. Less time than\r\nthis involves loss in yield and quality of the cheese. In other words,\r\nthe time requirement for these changes cannot be ignored. The object of\r\npressing is not primarily to remove whey but to produce the physical\r\nconditions essential to ripening the cheese in a mass and put it in\r\nconvenient form for handling. The whey should have been removed during\r\nthe cooking and cheddaring. When ready for the press, the temperature of\r\nthe curd should be about 80° to 85° F.; it should be brought down to\r\nthis point during the milling, salting and hooping processes. If the\r\ncurd is put to press too warm or too cold, the following results may be\r\nexpected:\r\n\r\nToo high temperature during pressing produces several faults, as:\r\n\r\n  (1) Favors the development of undesirable ferments.\r\n\r\n  (2) Causes excessive loss of fat.\r\n\r\n  (3) Gives the curd pieces a greasy surface so that they\r\n  will not readily pass into a compact cheese. If a cheese\r\n  is greasy, the bandages will not stick.\r\n\r\n  (4) Favors the formation of mechanical holes in the\r\n  cheese.\r\n\r\n  (5) Causes \"seamy\" color in the cheese by the collection\r\n  of fat between pieces of curd.\r\n\r\nToo low temperature has its difficulties, such as:\r\n\r\n  (1) The pieces of curd will not fuse together.\r\n\r\n  (2) The rind does not form properly.\r\n\r\n  (3) It appears to cause mottled cheese.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 47.--Continuous pressure gang cheese-press.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 48.--Filling the hoops and pressing the curd.]\r\n\r\nThe commonly used gang press may or may not have an arrangement to cause\r\ncontinuous pressure to be applied to the cheese (Figs. 47, 48). When\r\nfresh cheeses are first placed in the press, the pressure should be\r\napplied very gradually. The curd, after being cut through the mill, will\r\nhave many exposed fat globules. A heavy pressure at first will force\r\nout the whey set free by the extracting power of the salt. The whey will\r\ncarry away the exposed fat globules, and therefore reduce the yield. As\r\nsoon as white whey starts from the hoops, the increased application of\r\nthe pressure should be stopped until the whey regains the appearance of\r\nclear brine. More pressure can then be gradually applied until full\r\npressure is reached. The cheeses should remain under heavy pressure for\r\none-half to one hour, when they should be removed from the press and\r\ndressed.\r\n\r\n+207. Dressing the cheese.+--When ready to dress the cheese, the press\r\nis opened and the hoops turned down. The hoops are opened so that the\r\nbandages can be lapped over the top of the cheeses about 1½ inches.\r\nBefore turning a bandage down, it should be carefully pulled up to\r\nremove any wrinkles from the sides of the cheese, but not hard enough to\r\npull it free from the bottom. After it is pulled up, the bandage should\r\nbe lapped over the top about 1½ inches, and if not even should be\r\ntrimmed with a sharp knife. It should then be sopped down with warm\r\nwater. Plenty of warm water to wet the bandage and cloths helps to form\r\na good rind. If starched circles are used, one should be placed on the\r\ntop of the cheese and sopped down with warm water. If not, the press\r\ncloth should be wrung out of warm water and put on smoothly, so there\r\nwill be no wrinkles. The hoop is then put together and placed back in\r\nthe press under heavy pressure for twelve to eighteen hours. The\r\npressure should be sufficient to cause the curd particles to unite so\r\nthat the surface of the cheese will be smooth. The next day the cheeses\r\nare taken from the hoops and placed in the curing-room. If they do not\r\ncome out of the hoop easily, they may be loosened by cutting between the\r\nsides of the cheese and the hoop with a knife. A special thin-bladed\r\nknife for this purpose is called a speed knife (Fig. 49). Care should be\r\ntaken not to cut the bandage when trying to loosen the cheese. If\r\nstarched circles are used, the press cloths are removed from the cheese,\r\nwhen they are put in the curing-room. If neither starched circles nor\r\npress cloth are left on the cheese in the curing-room, the rind will\r\ncrack on account of drying out on the exposed surface. This allows mold\r\nand insects to enter the cheese. The flavor, body and texture and color\r\nof the cheese are all dependent on the skill of the cheese-maker and the\r\nquality of the milk from which it is made. The finish is dependent\r\nentirely on the skill and carefulness of the maker. An operator should\r\nsee that the cheese press is straight so that there will be no crocked\r\ncheese and that the bandage and press cloths are properly put on,\r\nbecause the finish or appearance of the cheese is an index of his\r\nability.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 49.--Speed knife.]\r\n\r\n+208. Handling over-ripe and gassy milk.+--Because it is sometimes\r\nnecessary to make over-ripe[91] or gassy milk[92] into cheese, special\r\ndirections or precautions are necessary. The best way is to reject this\r\nmilk. When it is necessary to make it into cheese, the losses are much\r\nmore than with normal milk. It is a question of making as good a cheese\r\nas possible, and the subject of losses is ignored.\r\n\r\n(1) _Over-ripe milk._--The fact that the milk is over-ripe shows that\r\nthere is already too much acid present. Every effort must be made to get\r\nthe curd as firm as possible in the whey with the acid development as\r\nlow as possible or before the acid has had time to develop any more than\r\ncan be helped. Although the milk is over-ripe, it is a good plan to add\r\nabout ¼ of 1 per cent of starter just before the rennet. This starter\r\nwill not begin to work until the curd is being cheddared and it will\r\nhelp the flavor, especially if any bad fermentation should be present.\r\n\r\nThe rennet is added at 80° F., as this lower temperature tends to check\r\nthe acid development. More rennet is used, commonly from 4 to 4½\r\nounces to 1000 pounds of milk. This gives a quicker coagulation. The\r\ncurd is cut soft, as this tends to expel the moisture more quickly. The\r\nheat is turned on sooner after cutting. The time to turn it on and the\r\nlength of time to heat are determined by the amount of acid. A curd\r\nshould not be heated in less than fifteen minutes. If the curd has\r\nenough acid and has not begun to firm up much, the whey should be drawn\r\ndown to the surface of the curd, water the temperature of the whey and\r\ncurd put into the vat, and the curd firmed up in this water. The water\r\nwashes the acid out of the curd and because of the lack of milk-sugar\r\nchecks the acid development.\r\n\r\nIf the milk is not so ripe and the curd nearly firm enough, the whey may\r\nbe drawn off and the curd firmed up by hard stirring in the vat or sink.\r\nThe curd should not be pushed back enough to be very deep or thick when\r\nready to cheddar.\r\n\r\nThe curd should be cut into very small pieces to cheddar. The smaller\r\nthe pieces, the faster the whey drains away. Sometimes it is necessary\r\nto cut the curd into pieces six inches square. The pieces should not be\r\npiled but should be turned often and stood on edge to let the whey drain\r\naway and sometimes pressed with the hands to force the whey out. It is\r\noften all one man can do to keep the curd turned.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 50.--At the left is a regular shaped, close, solid\r\ntextured cheese; at the right one puffed up with gas.]\r\n\r\nThe curd is not cheddared very long but is milled early so that the whey\r\ncan escape. If it is thought that the cheese will be sour, the curd\r\nshould be washed in cold water to remove the acid and milk-sugar. A\r\nlittle more salt is sometimes used. A product made from over-ripe milk,\r\nno matter how skillful the cheese-maker, will show traces of a sour\r\ncheese.\r\n\r\n(2) _Gassy milk._--If a cheese-maker knows that there is \"gassy\"\r\nfermentation, he should add more starter and develop more acid when\r\nripening the milk to try to overcome this. There are different kinds of\r\ngassy fermentation. Some produce acid and some do not. Some will not\r\nshow until the cheeses have been on the curing-room shelves several\r\ndays. Others will cause the curd to float in the whey. Usually the gas\r\nshows as pin-holes while the curd is being cheddared.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 51.--This shows the same cheeses as in Fig. 50, cut\r\nopen to show the solid and gassy texture.]\r\n\r\nThe gas causes tiny round holes in the cheese, resulting in the cheese\r\nswelling or puffing out of shape and sometimes breaking open (Figs. 50,\r\n51). The only time to overcome the gas is during the cheddaring process.\r\nThe curd is piled and repiled until the holes flatten out. This shows\r\nthat the gas-producing organisms have weakened and will not cause any\r\nmore holes. Because the curd has to be piled so many times and so long,\r\nthe pieces become very thin. The curd is ready to mill when most of the\r\nholes have flattened. After milling, the curd should be stirred and\r\naired for some time before salting to allow the bad odor to escape.\r\n\r\nBecause of the high acid development, it often happens that the cheese\r\nwill not be gassy but will be sour. At best a cheese made from milk\r\nhaving gassy fermentation will have a bad flavor. The quality of the\r\ncheese can be no better than that of the milk from which it is made,\r\nplus the skill of the cheese-maker.\r\n\r\n+209. Qualities of Cheddar cheese.+--The cheese should be neat, clean\r\nand attractive. If unclean, and the bandage not put on the cheese\r\nproperly, it shows that the manufacturer is not particular to keep the\r\ncuring-room shelves tidy nor careful and painstaking in dressing. The\r\ncheese should not be lopsided or bulged. When cut, it should have a\r\nuniformly colored interior. The principal color defects are too high, or\r\ntoo light color, mottled or seamy. The texture should be solid and\r\nclose. A common defect is mechanical holes or openings and another is\r\ngas pockets. The body can be tested by rubbing the cheese between the\r\nthumb and fingers. It should be smooth and waxy and free from lumps. It\r\nshould rub down like cold butter. The common defects are graininess and\r\nlumpiness. Graininess may be caused by too much acid or too much\r\nmoisture in the cheese. Lumpiness is due to uneven curing. If too much\r\nmoisture is present, the body will be soft and mushy; if not enough\r\nmoisture, the body will be hard and dry.\r\n\r\nThe cheese should have a pleasant, clean, mild aroma and the\r\ncharacteristic flavor which is usually somewhat similar to that of nuts\r\nand so is spoken of as a nutty flavor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\n_COMPOSITION AND YIELD OF CHEDDAR CHEESE_\r\n\r\n\r\nSo many factors affect the composition and yield of Cheddar cheese that\r\nno positive or exact statement can be made unless other facts are\r\ndefinitely known. The following factors affect both the composition and\r\nyield:\r\n\r\n  1. The chemical composition of the milk.\r\n\r\n  2. Amount of moisture incorporated into the cheese.\r\n\r\n  3. The amount of solids lost in cheese-making.\r\n\r\n  4. The skill of the cheese-maker.\r\n\r\n  5. The bacterial-content of the milk.\r\n\r\n+210. Composition of milk, whey and cheese.+--The\r\nfollowing Tables[93] VI, VII, VIII, which are the average\r\nof forty-eight factories for the season of 1893, show the\r\nminimum, maximum and average composition:\r\n\r\n\r\n  TABLE VI\r\n\r\n  AVERAGE COMPOSITION OF THE MILK\r\n\r\n                      | Minimum | MAXIMUM | AVERAGE\r\n  --------------------|---------|---------|---------\r\n  Water               |  86.28  |  88.30  |  87.28\r\n  Total solids        |  11.70  |  13.72  |  12.72\r\n  Fat                 |   3.30  |   4.40  |   3.77\r\n  Casein              |   2.20  |   2.85  |   2.48\r\n  Albumin             |   0.52  |   0.81  |   0.69\r\n  Sugar and ash, etc. |   5.63  |   5.89  |   5.78\r\n\r\n\r\n  TABLE VII\r\n\r\n  AVERAGE COMPOSITION OF THE WHEY\r\n\r\n                      | Minimum | MAXIMUM | AVERAGE\r\n  --------------------|---------|---------|---------\r\n    Water             |  92.75  |  93.28  |  93.00\r\n    Total solids      |   6.72  |   7.25  |   7.00\r\n    Fat               |   0.24  |   0.51  |   0.38\r\n    Casein, albumin   |   0.66  |   0.99  |   0.86\r\n    Sugar, ash, etc.  |   5.63  |   5.86  |   5.76\r\n\r\n\r\n  TABLE VIII\r\n\r\n  AVERAGE COMPOSITION OF THE GREEN CHEESE\r\n\r\n                      | Minimum | MAXIMUM | AVERAGE\r\n  --------------------|---------|---------|---------\r\n    Water             |  33.16  |  43.89  |  37.33\r\n    Total solids      |  66.84  |  56.11  |  62.67\r\n    Fat               |  30.00  |  35.89  |  33.41\r\n    Casein            |  20.80  |  25.48  |  23.39\r\n    Sugar, ash, etc.  |   4.86  |   7.02  |   5.89\r\n\r\nTable VI shows the minimum, maximum and average composition of the milk\r\nand Table VIII the composition of the cheese made from that milk. The\r\naverage composition of the cheese in Table VIII shows that it contains\r\n37.33 per cent of water. The tendency to-day seems to be for a softer\r\ncheese so that the average would probably be higher. Table VIII also\r\nshows the wide variation in the composition of the cheese. The moisture\r\nand total solids both vary about 10 per cent. In order to judge the\r\nvariation in composition, one must know the composition of the milk and\r\nthe moisture-content of the cheese and then only a very inaccurate\r\nestimate of the composition of the cheese can be formed.\r\n\r\n+211. Relation of fat to casein in normal milk.+--In order to understand\r\nthe relation of the composition of the milk to yield of cheese, one must\r\nbe familiar with the relation of the fat to the casein in normal milk.\r\nThe following table[94] shows the relation of fat to casein in normal\r\nmilk:\r\n\r\n\r\n  TABLE IX\r\n\r\n  SUMMARY SHOWING THE RELATION OF FAT TO CASEIN\r\n  IN NORMAL MILK\r\n\r\n  ====================================================================\r\n          |           |          |           |           |  AVERAGE\r\n          |           |          |  AVERAGE  | AVERAGE   | POUNDS OF\r\n          | PER CENT  |  NUMBER  | PER CENT  | PER CENT  | CASEIN FOR\r\n  GROUP   | OF FAT IN |    OF    | OF FAT IN | OF CASEIN | EACH POUND\r\n          |   MILK    |  SAMPLES |  EACH IN  |   EACH    | OF FAT IN\r\n          |           |          |   GROUP   |   GROUP   |   MILK\r\n  --------+-----------+----------+-----------+-----------+------------\r\n    I     | 3.0-3.5   |   22     |   3.35    |   2.20    |   0.66\r\n   II     | 3.5-4.0   |  112     |   3.72    |   2.46    |   0.66\r\n  III     | 4.0-4.5   |   78     |   4.15    |   2.70    |   0.65\r\n   IV     | 4.5-5.0   |   16     |   4.74    |   3.05    |   0.64\r\n    V     | 5.0-5.25  |    7     |   5.13    |   3.12    |   0.61\r\n  ====================================================================\r\n\r\nTable IX shows that the pounds of casein for each pound of fat are not\r\nconstant but that the casein does not increase in proportion to the fat\r\nabove 4.0 per cent of fat in the milk.\r\n\r\n+212. Influence of fat in milk on yield of cheese.+--The following table\r\nshows the influence which fat in the milk has on the yield of\r\ncheese:[94]\r\n\r\n\r\n  TABLE X\r\n\r\n  SUMMARY SHOWING RELATION OF FAT IN MILK TO YIELD\r\n  OF CHEESE\r\n\r\n  ==============================================================\r\n        | AVERAGE PER | POUNDS OF GREEN CHEESE |   POUNDS OF\r\n  GROUP | CENT OF FAT |  MADE FROM 100 LB.

This is\r\ndue to the fact pointed out in Table IX, namely, that as the fat\r\nincreases in the milk the casein does not increase in the rich milk in\r\nproportion to the fat. From Tables IX and X this conclusion may be\r\ndrawn: that as the percentage of fat increases in the milk the more\r\ncheese can be made from 100 pounds of that milk, but after the increase\r\nin fat gets above 4 per cent the amount of cheese that can be made for\r\neach pound of fat in the milk is decreased because the casein does not\r\nincrease in proportion to the fat. No exact statement of yield can be\r\nmade without first stating the moisture-content of the cheese. The\r\nlosses also must be considered.\r\n\r\nVan Slyke[95] in the following Table XI shows the effect of the\r\nfat-content of normal milk on the yield of cheese.\r\n\r\nThe moisture-content of all the cheeses is reduced to a uniform basis of\r\n37 per cent.

The following table gives the amount of fat lost\r\nin whey with normal milk containing different percentages of fat:\r\n\r\n\r\n  TABLE XII\r\n\r\n  SUMMARY SHOWING AMOUNT OF FAT IN MILK LOST IN\r\n  CHEESE-MAKING\r\n\r\n  =================================================================\r\n  GROUP | POUNDS OF FAT IN | POUNDS OF FAT LOST |  PER CENT OF FAT\r\n        | 100 LB OF MILK   | IN WHEY FOR 100    |  IN MILK LOST\r\n        |                  | LB.

But the milk low in fat loses a\r\nhigher percentage of the total milk-fat in each 100 pounds of whey.\r\n\r\n+214. Effect of bacterial-content of milk on yield of cheese.+--The\r\nbacterial-content[96] of the milk influences the yield by affecting both\r\nthe moisture-content and the losses. If the milk is sour or has bad\r\nfermentation, the losses will be increased because the curd cannot be\r\ncarefully handled, and the moisture cannot be incorporated to the extent\r\nthat it can in clean milk, without injury to the quality. The\r\nproper-cooling of the milk in one instance increased the yield 0.3 pound\r\nof cheese for each 100 pounds of milk. The more moisture that can be\r\nincorporated into the cheese up to the legal limit, the greater the\r\nyield.\r\n\r\n+215. Factors affecting the moisture-content of Cheddar.+--The amount of\r\nmoisture that can be incorporated in a curd depends on several\r\nfactors.[97] The following increase the moisture-content control of the\r\ncheese:\r\n\r\n   1. Cutting the curd coarse.\r\n\r\n   2. High setting temperature.\r\n\r\n   3. Low acid in the curd at time of removing whey.\r\n\r\n   4. Not stirring the curd with the hand as the last of the whey is\r\n        removed.\r\n\r\n   5. Slow pressure.\r\n\r\n   6. High piling of the curd in the cheddaring process.\r\n\r\n   7. Small amount of salt.\r\n\r\n   8. Holding the curd at low temperature after the whey is removed.\r\n\r\n   9. Large amount of rennet.\r\n\r\n  10. Cutting the curd hard.\r\n\r\nThe following factors decrease the moisture-content of the cheese:\r\n\r\n   1. Fine cutting.\r\n\r\n   2. Low setting temperature.\r\n\r\n   3. High acid in the curd at time of removing the whey.\r\n\r\n   4. Stirring the curd with the hand as the last of the whey is removed.\r\n\r\n   5. Fast pressure.\r\n\r\n   6. Low piling of the curd in the cheddaring process.\r\n\r\n   7. Large amount of salt.\r\n\r\n   8. Holding the curd at high temperature after the\r\n        whey is removed.\r\n\r\n   9. Small amount of rennet.\r\n\r\n  10. Cutting the curd soft.\r\n\r\nFrom this discussion, it is evident that the yield of cheese from 100\r\npounds of milk increases with higher percentages of fat and casein in\r\nthe milk, with reduced losses of solids during manufacture, with the\r\nabsence of undesirable fermentations, and with the incorporation of\r\nlarge amounts of water.\r\n\r\n+216. Variations of the Cheddar process.+--The Cheddar process, as\r\nalready described, is widely employed in cheese factories. Many\r\nvarieties are found, however, and varietal names are used for such\r\nproducts. A whole series of these forms are either locally or widely\r\nmade in England and taught in the English dairy schools. Some of these\r\nvarieties resemble the factory Cheddar product fairly closely; others\r\nare clearly different products. A typical series of the variations as\r\ndeveloped in America will be considered.\r\n\r\nIn the commercial trade Cheddar cheese is usually designated by some\r\nname which indicates its size. The size of the cheese is determined by\r\nthat of the hoops. The hoops vary both in diameter and height. The table\r\non the following page shows the usual sizes of the hoops and the weight\r\nand name applied to the cheese.\r\n\r\n+217. Cheddar-type cheese from pasteurized milk.+--Sammis and Bruhn[98]\r\nhave described a variation of the Cheddar process to overcome the\r\ndifficulties of making cheese from pasteurized milk. Such milk curdles in\r\nvery unsatisfactory manner unless some chemical is added to compensate\r\nfor the salts lost and to offset the other changes resulting from heat.\r\nFor this purpose, they found the use of hydrochloric acid satisfactory.\r\n\r\n  TABLE XIII\r\n\r\n  SIZE OF CHEESE HOOPS, WEIGHT, AND TERM APPLIED TO\r\n  CHEESE\r\n\r\n  ========================================================================\r\n   DIAMETER OF   |     HEIGHT OF     | WEIGHT OF  | TERM APPLIED TO\r\n      HOOP       |      CHEESE       |  CHEESE    |     CHEESE\r\n                 |                   |  POUNDS    |\r\n  ---------------+-------------------+------------+-----------------------\r\n  6-7 in.        |     7-8 in.       |    9-11    | Young America\r\n  Tapers 5-7 in. |    10-14 in.      |   10-16    | Long Horn\r\n  12-14 in.      |    3½-4½ in.      |   18-24    | Daisy or Picnic\r\n  14-15½ in.     |     4-6 in.       |   30-40    | Twin (two in same box)\r\n  14-16 in.      |     4-7 in.       |   35-40    | Flat\r\n  13½-15 in.     |    10-12 in.      |   40-50    | Cheddar\r\n  14-16 in.      |    12-15 in.      |   75-90    | Export\r\n  ========================================================================\r\n\r\n\"The acidulation of milk with hydrochloric acid after pasteurization is\r\naccomplished without difficulty or danger of curdling by running a small\r\nstream of the acid, of normal concentration, into the cooled milk as it\r\nflows from the continuous pasteurizer into the cheese vat. One pound of\r\nnormal-strength acid is sufficient to raise 100 pounds of milk from 0.16\r\npercent to 0.25 percent acidity (calculated as per cent of lactic acid).\r\nThe amount of acid needed each day to bring the milk up to 0.25 per cent\r\nacidity is read from a table or calculated from the weight of the milk\r\nand its acidity, determined by the use of Manns's acid test (titration\r\nwith tenth-normal sodium hydrate and phenolphthalein). The preparation\r\nof standard-strength acid in carboy lots for this work and the\r\nacidulation of milk present no great difficulty to any one who is able\r\nto handle Manns's acid test correctly.\r\n\r\n\"After the milk is pasteurized and acidulated three-fourths per cent of\r\nfirst-class starter is added and the vat is heated to 85°. It is set\r\nwith rennet, using 2 ounces of rennet per thousand pounds of milk, so\r\nthat the milk begins to curdle in 7 minutes and is cut with three-eighth\r\ninch knives in 25 minutes. All portions of the work after adding rennet\r\nare carried out in an unvarying routine manner, according to a\r\nfixed-time schedule every day. As soon as the rennet has been added the\r\ncheese maker is able to calculate the exact time of day when each of the\r\nsucceeding operations should be performed, and the work of making the\r\ncheese is thus simplified and systematized. It is possible that the\r\nroutine process here described may be varied somewhat with advantage at\r\ndifferent factories.\"\r\n\r\nThis cheese usually lacks characteristic Cheddar flavor or contains it\r\nin very mild form. It therefore satisfies only those who seek very mild\r\nflavored products. Efforts are now being made to find a flavor producing\r\nsubstance or organism which will bring the flavor of this product more\r\nnearly to that of typical Cheddar.\r\n\r\n+218. Club cheese+ is known by a variety of trade names. It is made from\r\nCheddar cheese, so that it is especially liked by persons who care for\r\nstrong Cheddar flavor. It has a soft texture so that it spreads easily,\r\nand is therefore much used for sandwiches. Well-ripened or old Cheddar\r\ncheese is ground in a food chopper. The older the Cheddar, the stronger\r\nwill be the flavor of the club cheese. Cheese of good flavor should be\r\nused. In order to do away with all lumps in the texture, it is sometimes\r\nnecessary to run the mixed cheese through the food chopper a second\r\ntime. While all lumps must be worked out, care should be taken not to\r\nwork the cheese so much that it will become salvy and sticky.\r\n\r\nUsually a little pepper is added, to give the cheese a biting taste.\r\nSome manufacturers add a great variety of substances, but these are not\r\nnecessary and destroy the flavor of the cheese.\r\n\r\nClub cheese may be wrapped in tin-foil or put up in air-tight glass\r\njars. The latter practice, while more expensive, has the advantage of\r\nmaking the cheese keep longer; but for local trade tin-foil is just as\r\nsatisfactory as glass. In filling the glass, care must be taken not to\r\nleave any air spaces between the cheese and the glass, as this is likely\r\nto permit the cheese to mold. A glass jar can be filled and air spaces\r\nprevented by first smearing a very thin layer of cheese over the glass.\r\n\r\n+219. The stirred-curd or granular process.+--The original practice as\r\nbrought from England and followed in the farm dairies before the\r\ndevelopment of the factory system is now known variously as the\r\n\"stirred-curd\" or \"granular curd\" process. With the introduction of the\r\ncheese factory, as known to-day, this system was replaced by the Cheddar\r\ncheese. The old farm process is still used on some farms and in a few\r\nfactories. As the name indicates, the curd for such cheeses is kept\r\nstirred so that it remains in granular condition instead of being\r\nallowed to mat as in the Cheddar process.\r\n\r\nThe early steps of the two processes are identical. They diverge at the\r\npoint at which in the factory Cheddar process the whey is drawn and the\r\ncurd is allowed to mat. In some factories the curd and part of the whey\r\nare dipped into a curd sink. This allows the whey to escape more easily\r\nand quickly. In the stirred-curd process, the pieces of curd are kept\r\nseparated by stirring and not allowed to mat. The whey is drawn off and\r\nthe stirring continued by hand. After stirring fifteen to twenty\r\nminutes, the curd becomes so dry as not to mat easily. As soon as the\r\ncurd has reached this stage, the salt is evenly and thoroughly mixed\r\nwith it. More salt is added than in the Cheddar process because the curd\r\nis more moist than Cheddar curd at the time of salting. The whey freely\r\nseparating carries away much of the salt. The quantity of salt to use\r\ndepends on the amount of whey draining from the curd. After salting, the\r\ncurd is allowed to cool, with occasional stirring to prevent the\r\nformation of lumps. The advantage of the stirred-curd practice lies in\r\nthe shorter time required for making cheese and in the greater yield due\r\nto increased water-content. It has several disadvantages, among them\r\nbeing: (1) lack of control of undesirable fermentation; if gas organisms\r\nare present, the cheeses more frequently huff than with the Cheddar\r\nsystem; (2) there is more fat lost while stirring the curd, hence\r\nquality and yield suffer; (3) the water is not so thoroughly\r\nincorporated, which more frequently results in mottled cheeses; (4) the\r\nbody is commonly soft and \"weak,\" shows mechanical holes, and cures too\r\nrapidly. These faults are closely correlated with the presence of higher\r\npercentages of water than in cheeses made by the Cheddar process. In\r\nother words, the stirred-curd process usually produces a cheese with\r\nhigher water-content, hence more subject to the development of\r\nunfavorable fermentation than the Cheddar cheeses.\r\n\r\n+220. California Jack cheese+[99] is very similar to the stirred-curd or\r\ngranular process. This cheese was originally made in Monterey County on\r\nthe coast of California, about twenty-five years ago, in small\r\nquantities, but after it was found to sell well other counties started\r\nto manufacture it. As Monterey was the first county to make this\r\nproduct, it was named \"Monterey\" cheese. In order to distinguish the\r\ncheese made in other counties from this, it was suggested that it be\r\ngiven a name and, consequently, it was called \"Jack\" cheese. This has\r\nbeen accepted as its true name. The cheese is made mostly by Portuguese\r\nand Italian-Swiss, although some of the best of the variety is now\r\nmanufactured near Modesto, California.\r\n\r\nThis cheese is adapted for manufacture on small dairy farms, where there\r\nis inexpensive and scanty equipment. The smaller sizes of cheese are\r\nmade and ripened quickly. It has become widely used in California.\r\n\r\nThe cheese is made every morning, from evening's and morning's milk. The\r\nformer is put into the cheese vat at night, and morning's milk is added\r\nas milking is going on. When the milk is all in the vat, it is\r\nimmediately warmed to 86° to 88° F. and rennet extract is added (when\r\nmilk has 0.2 to 0.21 of 1 per cent acidity) at the rate of 6 to 8 ounces\r\nto 1000 pounds of milk. No coloring matter is used. It is ready for the\r\ncurd-knife in thirty to thirty-five minutes, its readiness being\r\ndetermined the same as in making Cheddar cheese. The curd is first cut\r\nlengthwise of the vat with the horizontal curd-knife and allowed to\r\nstand until the whey rises over and partly covers the curd, when it is\r\ncut again with the vertical curd-knife crosswise of the vat. It is then\r\nhand-stirred, gently at first, and the stirring is finished with the\r\nrake.\r\n\r\nEither a steam-heating or self-heating vat is used (the steam-heating\r\nvat is preferred) and temperature increased about one degree in five\r\nminutes. The curd is heated to 98° F. in winter, and to 105° F. to 110°\r\nF. in summer. After temperature is up, it is stirred occasionally with a\r\nrake until the whey is drawn at 0.14 to 0.15 of 1 per cent acidity.\r\n\r\nThe curd is hand-stirred as soon as the whey is nearly drained off, and\r\nraked to each side of the vat to drain more thoroughly, when it is\r\nquickly stirred again to keep it from lumping or matting. Salt is now\r\nadded at the rate of 1½ pounds to 100 pounds of curd, and stirred in\r\nthoroughly several times. During the salting process, cold water is\r\nallowed to run under the vat, the hot water having been run off\r\npreviously.\r\n\r\nCurd is put into cloths at a temperature of 80° to 85° F. No cheese\r\nhoops are used. Two sets of press cloths are necessary; one set is ready\r\nto use while the other is still on the cheese in the press. These press\r\ncloths are about one yard square. The press cloths are all laid out\r\nevenly one on top of the other, as many as there are cheeses. They are\r\nthen taken together and spread out over the top of a large, open tin\r\nmilk-pail, and pushed down in the center to the bottom of the pail, with\r\nthe edges hanging over the top. A common one-gallon lard pail is used to\r\nmeasure the curd into the press cloths. A lard pail full will make a\r\ncheese weighing six and one-half pounds, which is the popular size.\r\nAfter a pailful has been put into the press cloth, the four corners are\r\ncaught up with the left hand, while with the right hand the curd is\r\nformed round and the press cloth straightened and the other corners in\r\nturn taken up. The press cloth is now taken up tight over the curd with\r\nthe left hand, while the cheese is given a rolling motion on the table\r\nwith the right hand, pressing at the same time to expel some of the\r\nwhey. This twists the press cloth tight over the curd, where it is tied\r\nwith a stout string. After fixing them all (as many as there are\r\ncheeses) in this way, they are ready for the press.\r\n\r\nThe cheeses are pressed between two wooden planks, 12 inches wide, 1½\r\ninches thick, by whatever length is required for the number of cheeses\r\nto be pressed. One plank is nailed on supports at a convenient height\r\nfrom the floor on a little slant for the whey to drain off better. The\r\ncheeses in the press cloths are placed at the proper distance apart so\r\nthey do not touch. Then the other plank is put squarely over the top of\r\nthe cheese and levers about four feet long at an interval of five feet\r\nare placed over this plank, from a cleat in the wall, on the other end\r\nof which is placed a heavy weight of about 100 pounds, which acts as an\r\nautomatic pressure. The cheeses are left in the press until the next\r\nmorning, when they are taken out and put on the shelves in the\r\ncuring-room. The cheeses have no bandage or covering, and do not seem to\r\ncrock, and they form a very good rind.\r\n\r\nThe cheese is a sweet variety, weighs six and one-half pounds cured and\r\ncures in about three weeks ready to ship, and sells at 16 to 25 cents a\r\npound wholesale. Most of the work seems to lie in forming and rolling\r\nthe curd in press cloths before pressing. Trouble is experienced by the\r\nmakers, especially in warm climates in summer, in not having the milk at\r\na uniform acidity when rennet is added. Great improvements could be made\r\nin this cheese by using an acidimeter, paraffining and curing the cheese\r\nin an even temperature, not much over 60° F.\r\n\r\nOld and hard Jack cheese is also employed for grating and cooking, while\r\nthe fresh is used for the table.\r\n\r\n+221. The washed-curd process+ has been developed in recent years\r\nlargely in the state of New York. In this method, a regular Cheddar curd\r\nis made up to the time of milling. This curd is washed or soaked in cold\r\nwater during or directly after milling. The theoretical object of this\r\nwashing is to carry away bad flavors and to reduce over-development of\r\nacidity by washing away all traces of whey. However, cheese-makers soon\r\nfound that it increased the yield and this led some to carry it to\r\nextremes.\r\n\r\nAfter the curd has been milled, it is covered with cold water. The\r\ntemperature of this water ranges from 50° F. to 70° F. The curd is\r\nstirred in this water for various lengths of time according to the\r\njudgment of the cheese-maker. This time varies from five minutes to one\r\nhour. Sometimes the vat is partly filled with water and the curd milled\r\ndirectly into the water. This process has certain advantages and\r\ndisadvantages.\r\n\r\nThe advantages are: if too much acid has developed in the curd, this\r\nwashing will reduce it so that the cheese will not be sour. Sometimes\r\nwhen bad flavors are present in the curd, washing will tend to overcome\r\nor remove them. Its disadvantages are: the larger yield due to excessive\r\nsoaking tempts the makers to soak curd beyond the time needed to relieve\r\nthe initially sour condition. Curd soaked in this way produces cheeses\r\ncontaining percentages of water so high as to lower their quality. This\r\nincreases the yield sometimes as much as 3 to 5 per cent. Such a cheese\r\nis very soft in texture and does not cure like a Cheddar cheese which\r\nhas not been washed. Part of the lactic acid, milk-sugar[100] and the\r\ninorganic salts are removed by this washing. A washed-curd cheese will\r\nsometimes rot, due to the activity of the putrefactive bacteria, and to\r\nthe lack of the restraining effect of the lactic acid-forming bacteria.\r\nSome washed-curd cheeses are so soft that they will not retain their\r\nnormal shape.\r\n\r\nA washed-curd cheese is never sour because the milk-sugar and lactic\r\nacid have been removed by washing.\r\n\r\n+222. English dairy cheese.+--In some localities cheeses are still made\r\non the farms. These are mostly produced after the stirred-curd process,\r\nhence are soft-bodied and open-textured. They usually weigh ten to\r\ntwelve pounds and are three to four inches thick and twelve inches in\r\ndiameter.\r\n\r\n+223. Pineapple cheese.+--This variety derives its name from the fact\r\nthat the cheeses are made in about the size and shape of a pineapple.\r\nThe curd is made after the Cheddar process from either whole milk or\r\npartly skimmed milk. It is pressed in molds shaped like a pineapple. The\r\ncheeses are then hung in nets to give the checked appearance on the\r\nsurface. They are rubbed with linseed oil to prevent the surface\r\ncracking, and finally are shellacked.\r\n\r\n+224. Leyden.+--Among specialties, a cheese called Leyden originating in\r\nHolland is made in Michigan and New York. This is a part skim cheese\r\nheavily spiced with caraway seed. The ripe cheese is colored red as it\r\ngoes to market.\r\n\r\n+225. Cheddar cheese with pimientos.+--Recently some Cheddar cheeses\r\nhave been made with pimientos added. This gives a mixture of\r\ncharacteristic Cheddar and pimiento flavors, which seems to be desired\r\nby some persons. An ordinary Cheddar curd is made and the pimientos\r\nadded just before salting. The pimientos are ground rather coarsely and\r\nthen added to the curd together with the liquid which was with the\r\npimientos in the can. The pimiento should be thoroughly and evenly\r\nmixed with the curd to insure a uniform distribution and mottled color\r\nin the cheese. The salt is then applied. The remainder of the process is\r\nthe same as for ordinary Cheddar cheese.\r\n\r\n+226. Sage cheese+ is a product flavored from the leaves of the ordinary\r\ngarden sage. It is made by two methods: one, in which the sage leaves\r\nare used, and the other, in which a part of the curd is colored to\r\nimitate that given by the sage leaves, and sage oil or tea is used to\r\ngive the flavor.\r\n\r\nIn the leaf method, a regular Cheddar cheese curd is made up to the time\r\nof salting. Just before the salt is added, sage leaves are mixed with\r\nthe curd. The leaves should be dried and freed from stems and other\r\ncoarse particles and the leaves themselves broken up rather finely. The\r\nleaves are then added at the rate of 3 ounces for every 1000 pounds of\r\nmilk. Care must be exercised to see that the leaves are evenly mixed\r\nthrough the curd or an evenly mottled cheese will not result. The salt\r\nis then added. This sequence seems to increase the absorption of the\r\nflavor by the curd.\r\n\r\nIf these cheeses are consumed as soon as well cured, no fault can be\r\nfound. On the other hand, if they are held for any length of time,\r\nyellow areas form about each piece of sage leaf; the leaves decay\r\nrapidly and spoil the cheese. This method gives a very true flavored\r\nsage cheese, the only objection being that it cannot be held in storage\r\nfor any length of time without a marked deterioration.\r\n\r\nIn the other method of making sage cheese, either a vat with a movable\r\npartition or a large and a small vat must be used. In many cases the\r\nreceiving can is used as the small vat. After the milk is properly\r\nripened and ready to set, one-sixth to one-seventh of the milk is put\r\ninto the small vat. To this small vat, green coloring matter is added.\r\nJuice from the leaves of corn, clover, or spinach was formerly used as\r\ncoloring. Consequently the manufacture of sage cheese by this method was\r\nlimited to the seasons of the year when these leaves could be obtained.\r\nNow, however, the dairy supply houses have a harmless green color paste\r\nwhich is much cheaper and can be secured at any season of the year. The\r\namount of color paste to use will vary from 30 to 35 c.c. for every 1000\r\npounds of total milk. This should be added to the small vat of milk. It\r\ngives a green milk and later a green curd.\r\n\r\nBoth vats are worked along together, until the time for removing the\r\nwhey. Then the partition in the vat is removed or the small vat is mixed\r\nwith the large one. The green curd should then be evenly mixed with the\r\nwhite one or an even green mottled cheese will not result. The curds\r\nshould not be mixed until they are well firmed or the white curd will\r\ntake on a greenish cast and spoil the appearance of the cheese.\r\n\r\nAfter the whey is removed, the curd is allowed to mat as in ordinary\r\nCheddar but care must be exercised to pile the curd so that it cannot\r\nspread or \"draw\" out. If it does draw out, the small green spots will be\r\nstretched out and large blotches or patches of green will be the result.\r\nThe cheese-maker must watch the curd closely or he may not secure the\r\nmuch desired small green mottles. When the curd is well matted, it is\r\nmilled as in Cheddar. Just before the salt is added, the sage extract is\r\napplied to the curd.\r\n\r\nThe sage extract can be obtained from dairy supply houses, or a sage\r\ntea can be made by steeping the sage leaves. In many cases the\r\ncommercial extract gives the cheese a strong disagreeable flavor, but\r\nnot a true sage flavor. The sage tea gives a flavor more like that of\r\nthe leaves themselves. Too much of the extract or the leaves will give a\r\nvery rank flavor. The sage extract can best be put on the curd by means\r\nof a sprayer or atomizer with which it can be evenly sprayed over the\r\nentire surface. The extract should be applied two or three times and the\r\ncurd well stirred after each application. The amount of the extract to\r\nuse depends altogether on its strength; an ounce of the extract or three\r\nounces of sage tea to 1000 pounds of milk is about the correct amount.\r\nAfter the extract has been added, the salt is used at the same rate as\r\nwith a normal Cheddar curd and the sage curd is carried along the same\r\nas a Cheddar.\r\n\r\nThis extract method gives a sage cheese mottled with small green spots\r\nwhich somewhat resemble the green of sage leaves. A cheese made in this\r\nway can be held for a long time, as nothing has been added which can\r\ndecay. The only objection to this method is that the sage extract may\r\nnot give a true sage flavor. Therefore, the maker must try to obtain the\r\nbest extract possible or make his own from the sage leaves.\r\n\r\n+227. Skimmed-milk Cheddar cheese.+[101]--The process of making\r\nskimmed-milk cheese after the Cheddar process is varied with the amount\r\nof fat left in the milk. Before attempting to make skimmed-milk Cheddar,\r\none should become familiar with the process for whole-milk Cheddar.\r\nSkimmed-milk cheeses are usually highly colored.\r\n\r\nWhen part skimmed-milk cheese is manufactured, there is often\r\ndifficulty in getting the milk in the vat to test the desired percentage\r\nof fat. Some cheese-makers skim all the milk and then put in the desired\r\namount of cream. This practice seems wasteful, not only because of the\r\ncost of separation, but because the fat will not mix easily with the\r\nmilk but will tend to float on the surface. If the fat floats, there\r\nwill be a large loss. After a very few trials an operator can tell about\r\nhow much of the whole milk must be skimmed in order to have the mixed\r\nskimmed-milk and whole milk test the desired percentage of fat. The\r\nnecessary percentage of fat in the mixed milk to produce cheese of a\r\ncertain grade can be determined by testing the cheese by the Babcock\r\ntest. (See Chapter XIX.)\r\n\r\n+228. Full skimmed-milk Cheddar cheese.+--In the summer there is not\r\nmuch demand for full skimmed-milk cheese, but it is made in large\r\nquantity in winter. The method of manufacture is as follows:\r\n\r\nSkimmed-milk as it comes from the separator is at a temperature of about\r\n88° to 90° F.; it is ripened and set at this temperature. It is ripened\r\nrather highly on the acid test, from 0.18 to 0.20 of 1 per cent, and to\r\ncorrespond on the rennet test which will not be many spaces. In about\r\ntwenty-five to thirty minutes it is coagulated ready for cutting. The\r\ncurd of skimmed-milk cheese is cut a little softer than is that of\r\nwhole-milk cheese. Milk is usually set at 88° to 90° F. The curd is not\r\nordinarily cooked above this temperature. If the milk was 84° to 86° F.\r\nwhen set, then the curd should be raised to 88° to 90° F. The curd firms\r\nin the whey very rapidly. When firm enough, it should have a slight\r\ndevelopment of acid. On the acid test it should show 0.17 to 0.19 per\r\ncent, and on the hot iron 1/8 to ¼ of an inch. The milk should be ripe\r\nenough or starter enough should have been used, so that the acid will\r\ncontinue to develop in the \"pack\" very rapidly. During the cheddaring\r\nprocess the curd is piled more rapidly and in higher piles than is\r\ncustomary with whole-milk cheese. This is necessary to incorporate or\r\nassimilate a large percentage of water or whey in the cheese. Therefore\r\nthe process of skimmed-milk Cheddar cheese is much shorter. More acid is\r\ndeveloped with the skimmed-milk than with the whole-milk cheese because\r\nit seems necessary to develop proper texture. If the acid is not\r\ndeveloped sufficiently, the cheese will be very rubbery and cure very\r\nslowly, in which case bad fermentation and flavor may and often do\r\ndevelop. The curd is turned, piled or cheddared in the vat until it\r\nbegins to become meaty and fibrous. If there is danger of too much acid,\r\nthe curd may be rinsed off with water. It is then milled and salted at\r\nthe rate of 1 or 1¼ pounds of salt to the curd from each 1000 pounds\r\nof milk. The remainder of the process is the same as that for making\r\nwhole-milk cheese.\r\n\r\n+229. Half skimmed-milk Cheddar cheese.+--No definite directions can be\r\ngiven for the manufacture of part skimmed-milk cheese, because the\r\nprocess varies with the amount of fat left in the milk. As the fat is\r\ndecreased, the process becomes more like that for making full\r\nskimmed-milk cheese; as the fat is increased, the process becomes more\r\nlike that for whole-milk cheese. However, the process of making half\r\nskimmed-milk cheese is about midway between the two. The milk is ripened\r\nmore than it would be for whole-milk cheese, usually until it tests from\r\n0.15 to 0.17 of 1 per cent acid. The curd is coagulated and cut the same\r\nas for the other skimmed-milk cheeses. It is cooked to a temperature\r\njust sufficient to firm the curd, usually from 94° to 96° F. The lower\r\nthe temperature at which the curd can be cooked and yet become firm,\r\nthe better is the texture of the cheese. When the curd has firmed\r\nenough, or when sufficient acid development, from 0.15 to 0.17 of 1 per\r\ncent, has taken place, the whey is removed. The curd is then turned,\r\npiled or cheddared. A skimmed-milk curd may be piled much more rapidly\r\nthan a whole-milk curd without danger of injuring it. When the curd\r\nbecomes meaty or fibrous, it is milled. It should be salted at the rate\r\nof 1¼ to 2 pounds of salt to the curd from each 1000 pounds of milk.\r\nThe remainder of the process is the same as that for making whole-milk\r\ncheese.\r\n\r\nThe cheese-maker should observe the following points when making\r\nskimmed-milk cheese: (1) Have clean-flavored sweet milk; (2) use\r\nclean-flavored commercial starter; (3) ripen the milk sufficiently, but\r\nnot too much; (4) firm the curd at as low a temperature as possible; (5)\r\nhave the curd properly firmed when the whey is drawn; (6) cheddar the\r\ncurd faster than the curd from whole milk; (7) make the cheeses all the\r\nsame size; (8) keep the cheese neat and clean in the curing-room.\r\n\r\n+230. Yield and qualities of skimmed-milk Cheddar cheese.+--The results\r\nof skimming different percentages of whole milk containing varying\r\npercentages of fat are given in the following table. As the percentage\r\nof fat in the milk decreases, the yield of cheese also decreases,\r\naccording to the table. As the percentage of fat decreases in the milk,\r\nthe percentage of moisture in the cheese increases, showing that\r\nmoisture is substituted for fat. The yield of cheese from 100 pounds of\r\nmilk is also given in this table. This yield varies with the amount of\r\nmoisture incorporated into the cheese, the amount of solids not fat in\r\nthe milk, and the solids lost in the whey.\r\n\r\n\r\n  TABLE XIV\r\n\r\n  TABLE SHOWING THE COMPOSITION AND YIELD OF SKIMMED-MILK\r\n  CHEDDAR CHEESE\r\n\r\n  ============================================================================\r\n            |          |PERCENTAGE|NUMBER    | COMPOSITION OF THE CHEESE\r\n  PERCENTAGE|PERCENTAGE|OF FAT IN |OF POUNDS +----------+----------+----------\r\n  OF FAT    |OF THE    |THE MILK  |OF CHEESE |PERCENTAGE|          |\r\n  IN THE    |MILK      |IN THE    |FROM 100  |OF TOTAL  |PERCENTAGE|PERCENTAGE\r\n  MILK      |SKIMMED   |VAT AFTER |POUNDS    |OF TOTAL  |OF FAT    |OF WATER\r\n            |          |SKIMMING  |OF MILK   |SOLIDS    |          |\r\n  ----------+----------+----------+----------+----------+----------+----------\r\n     4.7    |    50    |    2.4   |   9.92   |  54.75   |   22.00  |  45.25\r\n     4.7    |    60    |    2.0   |   9.74   |  52.46   |   17.50  |  47.54\r\n     4.7    |    70    |    1.5   |   9.26   |  49.87   |   13.50  |  50.13\r\n     4.7    |    80    |    1.0   |   8.42   |  48.26   |   10.00  |  51.74\r\n     4.0    |    50    |    2.0   |   9.70   |  53.29   |   21.00  |  46.71\r\n     4.0    |    60    |    1.6   |   9.50   |  50.89   |   17.00  |  49.11\r\n     4.0    |    70    |    1.2   |   9.30   |  48.06   |   13.50  |  51.94\r\n     4.0    |    80    |    0.9   |   9.20   |  45.24   |   10.50  |  54.76\r\n     3.5    |    50    |    1.8   |   8.54   |  54.20   |   19.50  |  45.80\r\n     3.5    |    60    |    1.5   |   8.10   |  51.10   |   16.50  |  48.90\r\n     3.5    |    70    |    1.1   |   7.44   |  52.62   |   13.00  |  47.38\r\n     3.5    |    80    |    O.9   |   7.00   |  49.64   |    9.54  |  50.36\r\n     3.4    |    50    |    1.9   | 8.24[102]|  54.50   |   20.00  |  45.50\r\n     3.4    |    60    |    1.5   |   7.82   |  52.05   |   16.50  |  47.95\r\n     3.4    |    70    |   {1.4   |  {7.80   | {49.04   |  {14.00  | {50.96\r\n            |          |   {1.2   |  {7.28   | {50.76   |  {14.00  | {49.24\r\n     3.4    |    80    |    0.9   |   7.24   |  47.41   |   10.50  |  52.59\r\n  ============================================================================\r\n\r\nIn some creameries and cheese factories, the milk is skimmed and the\r\ncream made into butter and the skimmed-milk into cheese by the Cheddar\r\nprocess. In making cheese without the milk-fat, it is difficult to\r\nstandardize a method that will produce the flavor and body of the\r\nwhole-milk Cheddar cheese. A skimmed-milk cheese lacks the softness and\r\nmellowness of texture of the whole-milk product. It is very likely to be\r\ntough, dry or leathery. It is attempted to remedy this defect by\r\nincorporating more moisture into the skimmed-milk cheese. The added\r\nmoisture tends to replace the fat in giving a soft mellow body. It\r\nrequires skill on the part of the cheese-maker to incorporate moisture\r\nto take the place of the fat in giving the cheese mellowness and\r\nsmoothness of body.\r\n\r\nThe grades of skimmed-milk cheese vary between rather wide limits--from\r\nthose made entirely of skimmed-milk to those made of milk from which\r\nonly a small amount of fat has been removed and which are almost like\r\nwhole-milk cheese. Because of the gradations of skimmed-milk cheese, it\r\nis difficult to make anything but general statements and to base\r\ncomparisons with whole-milk cheese.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\n_CHEDDAR CHEESE RIPENING_\r\n\r\n\r\nFreshly made Cheddar cheese is hard, tough and elastic and lacks\r\ncharacteristic cheese flavor. In this condition it is called \"green,\"\r\nunripe or not cured. Before the cheese is ready to be eaten, it passes\r\nthrough a complex series of changes which are collectively known as\r\nripening. In the ripening process the texture becomes soft and mellow\r\nand the characteristic cheese flavors develop. Cheese ripening must be\r\nconsidered from two view-points, first, the changes taking place inside\r\nthe cheese and secondly the outside conditions necessary for ripening.\r\nSome of the chemical changes during ripening are known, while others are\r\nnot understood. The different agents causing ripening, and the\r\nconstituents of the milk, will be discussed.\r\n\r\n+231. Fat.+--Numerous investigations have been made to ascertain what\r\nchemical changes the fat undergoes in the ripening process. Suzuki,[103]\r\nin studying the fat, found no enzyme capable of producing lactic acid or\r\nvolatile fatty acids. However, these acids were found in increasing\r\namounts during the ripening process and after the lactose had\r\ndisappeared. Acetic and propionic acids reached a maximum at three\r\nmonths and then decreased, while butyric and caproic acids continually\r\nincreased during the experimental period covered. Formic acid was\r\ndetected in the whole-milk cheese only at the five and one-half month\r\nstage. In the judgment of the experimenter the principal source of\r\nacetic and propionic acids was probably lactates. Traces of these acids\r\nmay have had their origin in protein decomposition or further\r\nfermentation of glycerine. The principal sources indicated for butyric\r\nand caproic acids were fats and proteins.\r\n\r\nThe distillate from the experimental cheese was designated \"flavor\r\nsolution\" and contained alcohols and esters, giving a close resemblance\r\nto the cheese aroma. The \"flavor solution\" from the mild whole-milk\r\ncheese contained esters made up largely of ethyl alcohol and acetic\r\nacid, while from the more pungent skimmed-milk cheese the esters were\r\nlargely compounds of ethyl alcohol and caproic and butyric acids. The\r\nalcohol may have come from the lactose fermentation. It appears to be an\r\nimportant factor in flavor production. The agencies operative in the\r\nproduction of volatile acids and syntheses of esters are as yet\r\nundefined.\r\n\r\n+232. Milk-sugar.+--The milk-sugar (lactose) is changed into lactic acid\r\nby the lactic acid-forming organisms, within the first few days after\r\nthe cheese is made. This acid is combined with the other constituents as\r\nfast as it is formed. After a few days, the milk-sugar will have\r\nentirely disappeared from the cheese.[104] The relation between the\r\nmilk-sugar and lactic acid is very close. It is necessary that\r\nmilk-sugar be present in order later to have the lactic acid develop.\r\n\r\n+233. The salts.+--Just what changes the salts[105] undergo or how they\r\ncombine with the other compounds is not definitely known. It is supposed\r\nthat the calcium salts first combine with the phosphates and later, as\r\nthe lactic acid is formed, they combine with the lactic acid, forming a\r\ncalcium lactate.\r\n\r\n+234. Gases.+--In the process of cheese ripening, gases are formed, the\r\ncommonest being carbon dioxide.[106] Exactly how this gas is formed is\r\nnot known. It may be due to the formation of lactic acid from the\r\nmilk-sugar or to the living organisms in the cheese.\r\n\r\n+235. Casein or proteins.+--Complex ripening changes in the cheese take\r\nplace in the casein compounds or proteins. Because of the complex\r\nchemical nature of the proteins and the various agents acting on them,\r\nit is difficult to follow these changes. This has led to different\r\nopinions regarding the ripening process. The various compounds thought\r\nto be formed from the casein or proteins are as follows:[107]\r\n\r\n_Paracasein_ (formed by the action of the rennet on the casein).\r\nInsoluble in brine and warm 5 per cent salt brine.\r\n\r\n_Protein._ Soluble in warm 5 per cent salt brine.\r\n\r\n_Protein._ Insoluble in warm salt brine or water.\r\n\r\n_Paranuclein._ A protein soluble in water and precipitable by dilute\r\nhydrochloric acid.\r\n\r\n_Caseoses and proteoses._ Protein derivations soluble in water and not\r\ncoagulated by heat.\r\n\r\n_Peptones._ Protein derivations simpler than the proteoses, soluble in\r\nwater and not coagulated by heat.\r\n\r\n_Amido acids._ Protein derivations soluble in water, least complex\r\nexcept ammonia.\r\n\r\n_Ammonia._ The simplest protein derivations.\r\n\r\nFrom the discussion of the constituents in the milk and cheese, it is\r\nevident that practically all the principal ripening changes are\r\nconcerned with those taking place in the proteins.\r\n\r\n+236. Causes of ripening changes.+--Authorities disagree as to the exact\r\nagents which cause the ripening changes. Some think they are due to the\r\naction of the enzymes in the rennet and those secreted in the milk.\r\nOthers hold that these changes are due entirely to bacterial action. A\r\ncombination of the two seems probable. The action of the rennet extract\r\nrenders the casein insoluble and in the ripening process the proteins\r\nbecome soluble, the degree depending on the length of time the cheese is\r\nripened. The amount of water-soluble proteins and protein derivatives is\r\nused as a measure of the extent of cheese ripening, considered from a\r\nchemical standpoint.\r\n\r\n+237. Action of the rennet extract.+--Some authorities hold that rennet\r\nextract contains two enzymes, rennin and pepsin, while others think it\r\nis a single peptic ferment. These enzymes produce effects[108] closely\r\nrelated to, if not identical with, those of pepsin in the following\r\nparticulars: neither the rennet enzyme nor pepsin causes much, if any,\r\nproteolytic change except in the presence of acid; the quantitative\r\nresults of proteolysis furnished by the rennet enzyme and pepsin agree\r\nclosely, when working on the same material under comparable conditions;\r\nthe classes of soluble nitrogen compounds formed by the two enzymes are\r\nthe same, both quantitatively and qualitatively; neither enzyme forms\r\nany considerable amount of amido compounds and neither produces any\r\nammonia; the soluble nitrogen compounds formed by both enzymes are\r\nconfined to the group of compounds known as paranuclein, caseoses and\r\npeptones.\r\n\r\nRennet exerts a digestive effect on the casein[109] which is intensified\r\nby the development of acid in the curd. The soluble nitrogenous products\r\nformed in Cheddar cheese by the rennet enzymes are the albumoses and the\r\nhigher peptones. Experiments show that no flavor develops until the\r\namido acids and ammonia are formed. When the rennet enzymes were the\r\nonly digesting ferments in the cheese, there was no trace of cheese\r\nflavor. This is probably due to the fact that the rennet enzyme changed\r\nthe casein into caseoses and peptones but did not form amido acids and\r\nammonia. Some authorities[110] think that the enzyme galactase carries\r\nthe ripening of the protein from this stage. The question arises whether\r\nthese intermediate compounds must be found before other agents can form\r\nthe amido acids and ammonia.\r\n\r\n\r\n  TABLE XV[111]\r\n\r\n  SHOWING THE EFFECT OF DIFFERENT AMOUNTS OF RENEET\r\n  EXTRACTS ON THE RATE OF FORMATION OF SOLUBLE\r\n  NITROGEN COMPOUNDS IN CHEESE RIPENING\r\n\r\n  =========================================================\r\n                   | PER CENT OF WATER SOLUBLE NITROGEN\r\n    QUANTITY OF    |      COMPOUNDS IN THE CHEESE\r\n  RENNET ADDED PER +---------------------------------------\r\n  1000 LB.

The action of the bacteria.+--Authorities[112] disagree as to the\r\ngroups of bacteria found in Cheddar cheese. This may be due to lack of\r\nproper classification. Some of the groups are: _Bacterium lactis acidi_,\r\n_B. coli communis_, _B. lactis aerogenes_, _B. casei_, Streptococci,\r\n_B.[113] Bulgaricum_ and Micrococci. Authorities agree that the _B.\r\nlactis acidi_ group is the most prominent. This group makes up 90 per\r\ncent or more of the total bacteria flora of the cheese in the early\r\nstages of ripening. In the course of a few weeks, however, this group is\r\nlargely replaced by the _B. casei_ group[114].\r\n\r\n\r\n  TABLE XVI\r\n\r\n  SHOWING THE NUMBER OF BACTERIA TO A GRAM IN CHEDDAR\r\n  CHEESE AS DETERMINED BY LACTOSE-AGAR PLATE CULTURES\r\n\r\n  ====================================================================\r\n   TIME OF |                       CHEESE NUMBER\r\n   PLATING +-------------+---------------+-------------+--------------\r\n           |     580     |      581      |     582     |     583\r\n  ---------+-------------+---------------+-------------+--------------\r\n  Milk     |   8,000,000 |       500,000 |     700,000 |       500,000\r\n  ---------+-------------+---------------+-------------+--------------\r\n  Curd at  |             |               |             |\r\n  salting  | 160,000,000 |   326,000,000 | 912,000,000 |   839,000,000\r\n  time     |             |               |             |\r\n  ---------+-------------+---------------+-------------+--------------\r\n  12 hours | 332,000,000 | 1,048,000,000 | 623,000,000 |   965,000,000\r\n  ---------+-------------+---------------+-------------+--------------\r\n  1 day    | 586,000,000 |   736,000,000 | 709,000,000 |   569,000,000\r\n  ---------+-------------+---------------+-------------+--------------\r\n  2 days   | 235,000,000 |   405,000,000 | 848,000,000 |   580,000,000\r\n  ---------+-------------+---------------+-------------+--------------\r\n  4 days   | 145,000,000 |   684,000,000 | 522,000,000 | 1,025,000,000\r\n  ---------+-------------+---------------+-------------+--------------\r\n  6 days   | 165,000,000 |   184,000,000 | 853,000,000 |   184,000,000\r\n  ---------+-------------+---------------+-------------+--------------\r\n  14 days  |  51,000,000 |   211,000,000 | 369,000,000 |   401,000,000\r\n  ---------+-------------+---------------+-------------+--------------\r\n  21 days  | 284,000,000 |   290,000,000 | 348,000,000 |   319,000,000\r\n  ---------+-------------+---------------+-------------+--------------\r\n  28 days  | 285,000,000 |   453,000,000 | 314,000,000 |   144,000,000\r\n  ---------+-------------+---------------+-------------+--------------\r\n  35 days  | 104,000,000 |   261,000,000 | 326,000,000 |   504,000,000\r\n  ---------+-------------+---------------+-------------+--------------\r\n  49 days  | 132,000,000 |   228,000,000 | 436,000,000 |   661,000,000\r\n  ---------+-------------+---------------+-------------+--------------\r\n  70 days  | 128,000,000 |   291,000,000 | 193,000,000 |   168,000,000\r\n  ---------+-------------+---------------+-------------+--------------\r\n  98 days  | 114,000,000 |   212,000,000 |  45,000,000 |    55,000,000\r\n  ====================================================================\r\n\r\n  From Wis. Bul. 150.\r\n\r\nThe large number of bacteria in the cheese is very striking. The number\r\nas given in the accompanying table is not that actually in the cheese,\r\nas it is very difficult to obtain the sample in suitable condition for\r\nplating.[115]\r\n\r\nThe principal action of the lactic acid-forming bacteria in the cheese\r\nripening is the changing of the milk-sugar or lactose into lactic acid\r\nand the formation of small amounts of other substances, such as acetic,\r\nsuccinic and formic acids, alcohol, aldehydes and esters and some gases,\r\ncarbon dioxide and hydrogen. While the amount of these substances other\r\nthan lactic acid is small, it is thought that the effect of these on the\r\ncheese may be important. Heinemann shows[116] that lactic acid exists in\r\ntwo optical modifications, the levorotatory and dextrorotary acids. In\r\ncheese they are usually found in the inactive or racemic form, the\r\nlevorotatory and dextrorotary acids being present in equal amounts. What\r\nimportance the question of optical activity of the lactic acid may\r\nassume is not definitely known. Just as some groups of bacteria have a\r\nspecific effect on the lactose, producing only one modification of\r\nlactic acid, so bacteria attacking lactic acid may exercise a selective\r\naction and use only one or the other optically active modification. In\r\nother words, the early flora of cheese-ripening bacteria may determine\r\nthe later flora by the production of a form of lactic acid attacked by\r\none group of bacteria and not by another, and the effect on the flavor\r\nwill differ accordingly. The amount of lactic acid in the cheese\r\nincreases for a time, then decreases.\r\n\r\nThe errors in determining lactic acid are considerable. It seems that\r\nthe tendency is toward an increase of lactic acid in the cheese long\r\nafter the lactose has disappeared. Two explanations are offered: one,\r\nthat in the lactic acid fermentation an intermediate compound or\r\ncompounds are formed which exist for some time, the conversion into\r\nlactic acid being complete at about three months; the other is that\r\nlactic acid is formed as a product of paracasein proteolysis.\r\n\r\nThe lactic acid formed in cheese ripening does not exist in a free state\r\nbut reacts with the calcium salts in the cheese and forms calcium\r\nlactates. It is thought that there is sufficient of these salts to\r\nneutralize all the acid formed, and therefore the acid does not enter\r\ninto combination with the paracasein salts. It has been found that\r\nlactates are the principal source of acetic and propionic acids. These\r\nare supposed to have some effect on the flavor of the cheese.\r\n\r\nThe effect of lactic acid as a determinant of bacterial and enzymic\r\nchanges is very important. Early in the ripening process, lactic acid\r\nsuppresses the growth of undesirable micro-organisms. It also furnishes\r\nthe acid medium necessary for the best action of both the coagulating\r\nand peptic enzymes.\r\n\r\nThe importance of the lactic acid bacteria in cheese ripening has been\r\nsummed up by Hastings[117] as follows: \"The functions of this group of\r\nbacteria in Cheddar cheese are through their by-product lactic acid as\r\nfollows: (_a_) To favor the curdling of milk by rennet. (_b_) The\r\nbacteria of the milk are held in great part in the curd. Through the\r\nacid they influence the shrinkage of the curd and expulsion of the whey,\r\n(_c_) The acid so changes the nature of the curd as to cause 'matting,'\r\nor 'cheddaring' of the curd, (_d_) The acid activates the pepsin of the\r\nrennet extract, (_e_) The acid prevents the growth of putrefactive\r\nbacteria in the cheese. (_f_) It has been shown that _Bacterium lactis\r\nacidi_ is able to form acid in the absence of the living cell. (_g_) The\r\ndevelopment of _Bacterium lactis acidi_ is followed by the growth of\r\nanother group of acid-forming bacteria, the _Bacillus Bulgaricus_ group.\r\nThey reach numbers comparable with those of the first group, reaching\r\ntheir maximum number within the first month of ripening. Since they\r\ndevelop after the fermentation of the milk-sugar, they must have some\r\nother source of carbon and of energy than milk-sugar.\" It is also\r\nprobable that other groups constantly present contribute to the changes.\r\n\r\nFrom the preceding discussion it is evident that each of the ripening\r\nagents has its important part to play in the ripening process and a\r\nnormal ripening of the cheese is a composite result of these various\r\nagencies.\r\n\r\n+239. Conditions affecting the rate of cheese ripening.+--The rate at\r\nwhich these agents cause ripening of the cheese depends on several\r\nfactors.[118] Most of these factors are within the control of man. They\r\nare as follows: the length of time; temperature of the curing-room;\r\nmoisture-content of the cheese; size of the cheese; the quantity of salt\r\nused; the amount of rennet; the influence of acid.\r\n\r\n+240. The length of time.+--The water-soluble nitrogen compounds\r\nincrease as the cheese ages, other conditions being uniform. The rate of\r\nincrease is not uniform; it is much more rapid in the early than in the\r\nsucceeding stages of ripening.\r\n\r\n+241. The temperature of the curing-room.+--Very few cheese factories\r\nhave made any provision for regulating the temperature of the\r\ncuring-room. Without such provision the temperature follows closely that\r\nof the outside air. In some cases the curing-room is located over the\r\nboiler-room and hence becomes very hot. In the cheese warehouses,\r\nprovision has been made to control the temperature very closely.\r\nExperiments show that the soluble nitrogen compounds increase, on the\r\naverage, closely in proportion to an increase of temperature, when the\r\nother conditions are uniform.\r\n\r\nThe temperature of the curing-room has a material effect on the quality\r\nof the cheese. Cheese made from the same day's milk, and part cured at\r\n40° F., part at 50° F., part at 60° F. show considerable differences,\r\nthe greatest seeming to be in the flavor and texture. Those kept at the\r\nlow temperature cure more slowly and develop a milder flavor, those at\r\nthe higher temperature cure faster and develop undesirable flavors. At\r\nthe higher temperature the undesirable organisms seem to be more active.\r\nSome very skillful makers and judges of cheese have always contended\r\nthat if Cheddar is properly made, firmed to the body and texture of a\r\nhigh-class cheese, ripening at 55 to 60° F. gives a higher quality. Such\r\na cheese must be low in moisture, perhaps 3 to 5 per cent lower than one\r\ncured successfully by the cold process.\r\n\r\nThe following tables[119] XVII, XVIII show the effect of different\r\ntemperatures of curing cheese on the total score and on the points of\r\nthe flavor, body and texture:\r\n\r\n\r\n  TABLE XVII\r\n\r\n  TABLE SHOWING THE RELATION OF TEMPERATURE OF CURING\r\n  TO TOTAL SCORE\r\n\r\n  ==========================================\r\n  TEMPERATURE OF CURING | TOTAL SCORE\r\n  ----------------------+-------------------\r\n          40°           |     95.7\r\n          50°           |     94.2\r\n          60°           |     91.7\r\n  ==========================================\r\n\r\n\r\n  TABLE XVIII\r\n\r\n  TABLE SHOWING THE RELATION OF TEMPERATURE OF CURING\r\n  TO SCORE OF BODY AND TEXTURE, AND FLAVOR\r\n\r\n  =================================================\r\n  TEMPERATURE OF CURING | 40° F. | 50° F. | 60° F.\r\n  ----------------------+--------+--------+--------\r\n  Body and texture      |  23.4  |  32.0  |  22.2\r\n  Flavor                |  47.4  |  46.4  |  44.8\r\n  =================================================\r\n\r\nOf the three temperatures of curing, the lowest gave a higher total\r\nscore and a higher score for flavor, body and texture.\r\n\r\nThe curing temperature should not go low enough to freeze the cheese, as\r\nthis lowers the quality. The cheese will cure very slowly and have a\r\nmealy texture.\r\n\r\n+242. Moisture-content of the cheese.+--Other conditions being equal,\r\nthere is a larger amount of water-soluble nitrogen compounds in cheese\r\ncontaining more moisture than in that containing less moisture.\r\nTherefore, a high moisture-content of the cheese causes it to cure\r\nfaster. The presence of moisture also serves to dilute the fermentation\r\nproducts which otherwise would accumulate and thus check the action of\r\nthe ripening agents.\r\n\r\n+243. The size of the cheese.+--Cheeses of large size usually cure\r\nfaster than smaller ones, under the same conditions. This is due to the\r\nfact that the large cheeses lose their moisture less rapidly by\r\nevaporation and therefore after the early period of ripening have a\r\nhigher water-content.\r\n\r\n+244. The amount of salt.+--The relation of salt to the rate of ripening\r\nis more or less directly associated with the moisture-content of the\r\ncheese, since an increase in the amount of salt decreases the moisture.\r\nThus, cheese containing more salt forms water-soluble nitrogen compounds\r\nmore slowly than that containing less salt. The salt also has a direct\r\neffect in retarding one or more of the ripening agents.\r\n\r\n+245. The amount of rennet extract.+--The use of increased amounts of\r\nrennet extract in cheese-making, other conditions being uniform, results\r\nin the production of increased quantities of soluble nitrogen compounds\r\nin a given period of time, especially such compounds as paranuclein,\r\ncaseoses and peptones.\r\n\r\n+246. The influence of acid.+--It is necessary that acid be present but\r\nthe exact relation of varying quantities of acid to the chemical changes\r\nof the ripening process is not fully known. If too much acid is present,\r\nit imparts a sour taste to the cheese. It also causes the texture of the\r\ncheese to be mealy or sandy instead of smooth and waxy.\r\n\r\nConditions that may increase the rate of ripening:\r\n\r\n  1. Increase of temperature.\r\n  2. Larger amounts of rennet.\r\n  3. More moisture in the cheese.\r\n  4. Less salt.\r\n  5. Large size of the cheese.\r\n  6. Moderate amount of acid.\r\n\r\nConditions that may retard ripening:\r\n\r\n  1. Decrease of temperature.\r\n  2. Smaller amounts of rennet.\r\n  3. Less moisture in the cheese.\r\n  4. More salt.\r\n  5. Small size of the cheese.\r\n  6. No acid or an excess of acid.\r\n\r\n+247. Care of the cheese in the curing-room.+--The cheeses need daily\r\nattention while in the curing-room (Fig. 53). They should be turned\r\nevery day to prevent sticking and molding to the shelf and to secure an\r\neven evaporation of moisture. If not turned, the moisture will not\r\nevaporate evenly from all surfaces and will result in an uneven\r\ndistribution in the cheese, which causes uneven curing, and usually\r\ngives the product an uneven color.\r\n\r\nThe surface of the cheese should be watched to see that the cloths\r\nstick. If they do not, the surface will crack, due to the evaporation of\r\nthe moisture. If the cloths are loosened, they should be removed and the\r\nsurface of the cheese greased with butter. The grease will tend to\r\nprevent the rind from cracking. If the surface of the cheese is not\r\nsmooth, due to wrinkles in the bandage, or if it cracks, due to the lack\r\nof cloths, it furnishes the opportunity for insects to lay their eggs\r\nand the larvæ to develop within the cheese. Molds also lodge and grow in\r\nsuch cracks.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 53.--Cheddar cheese curing-room.]\r\n\r\nThe cheese should be kept clean while in the curing-room. This means\r\nthat the hands of the person handling the cheese must be clean. The\r\nshelves should be washed with good cleaning solution and scalded with\r\nhot water whenever they become greasy or moldy.\r\n\r\nSome means should be provided for regulating the temperature and\r\nhumidity of the curing-room. In most factories this is accomplished by\r\nopening the doors and windows at night to admit the cool air and closing\r\nthem in the morning to keep out the hot air. Care should be taken to\r\nkeep the doors and windows closely secured. The windows should have\r\nshades to keep out the sun. If the room becomes too dry, the floor may\r\nbe dampened with cold water.\r\n\r\nThe length of time in the curing-room depends on how often shipment is\r\nmade to some central warehouse or to the market. This usually varies\r\nfrom two to six weeks.\r\n\r\nWhen the surface of the cheese becomes dry and the rind is well formed,\r\nthe cheese may be paraffined. It usually requires four to six days after\r\ncheeses are taken from the hoop before they are ready for this process.\r\nThe object of paraffining is to prevent the escape of moisture and to\r\nkeep the cheese from molding.\r\n\r\n+248. Evaporation of moisture from the cheese during ripening.+--The\r\nlosses due to evaporation while the cheeses are curing are a\r\nconsiderable item. The rate of evaporation depends on the temperature\r\nand humidity of the curing-room, the size of the cheese, the\r\nmoisture-content and protection to the surface.\r\n\r\nTable XIX[120] shows the effect of size of cheese and temperature of the\r\ncuring-room, on losses while curing. This table shows that the\r\nevaporation of moisture is more as the size of the cheese decreases and\r\nthe temperature is increased. This is probably due to the fact that the\r\nsmaller cheese has more surface to a pound than a large cheese. The\r\nevaporation increases with temperature, probably because of lowered\r\nrelative humidity. The humidity can be tested with an hygrometer.\r\n\r\n\r\n  TABLE XIX\r\n\r\n  SHOWING THE VARIATION OF LOSSES IN WEIGHT OF CHEDDAR\r\n  CHEESE WHILE CURING, DUE TO SIZE OF CHEESE AND TEMPERATURE\r\n  OF CURING-ROOM\r\n\r\n  =============================================================\r\n                   | WEIGHT LOST PER 100 POUNDS OF CHEESE IN 20\r\n  WEIGHT OF CHEESE |                   WEEKS AT\r\n     IN POUNDS     +---------------+--------------+------------\r\n                   |     40° F.    |    50° F.    |    60° F.\r\n  -----------------+---------------+--------------+------------\r\n        70         |     2.5       |    2.4       |    4.2\r\n        45         |     2.7       |    3.7       |    5.1\r\n        35         |     3.9       |    5.9       |    8.5\r\n        12½        |     4.6       |    8.1       |   12.0\r\n  =============================================================\r\n\r\nThe higher the moisture-content of the cheese, usually the more rapid is\r\nthe evaporation. This is due to several causes: there is more moisture\r\nto evaporate; the moisture is not so well incorporated; a moist cheese\r\ndoes not form so good a rind.\r\n\r\n249. +Paraffining+[121] consists of dipping the cheese in melted\r\nparaffin at a temperature of about 220° F. for six seconds. Fig. 54\r\nshows an apparatus for paraffining. This leaves a very thin coat of\r\nparaffin on the cheese; at a lower temperature, a thicker coat would be\r\nleft. The thicker coating is more liable to crack and peel off. If the\r\ncheese is not perfectly dry before it is treated, the paraffin will\r\nblister and crack off.\r\n\r\nBefore a cheese is paraffined, the press cloth is removed and also the\r\nstarched circles, if loose. After a cheese has been paraffined, if the\r\ncoating is not broken, the loss due to evaporation is greatly reduced.\r\nThe amount of paraffin to coat a 35-pound cheese will depend on the\r\ntemperature of the paraffin and the length of time the cheese is\r\nimmersed. Usually at 220° F. it requires about 0.15 of a pound for each\r\n35-pound cheese. After the cheeses have been paraffined, they may be\r\nleft on the curing-room shelves or boxed ready to ship.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 54.--A paraffiner for cheese.]\r\n\r\n+250. Shipping.+--When ready to ship, each cheese should be carefully\r\nand accurately weighed and boxed. Usually these cheeses are boxed after\r\nbeing paraffined. If press cloths are left on the cheese in the\r\ncuring-room, they should be removed just before weighing. These cloths\r\nshould not be left in a pile in the factory after being removed as they\r\nhave been known to heat and sometimes cause fires. They should be washed\r\nclean and dried ready for use again. If starched circles are used, they\r\nshould be left on the cheese. A scale board should be placed on each end\r\nof the cheese to prevent its sticking to the box and also to keep the\r\nbox from wearing the surface of the cheese.\r\n\r\nThe box should be a trifle larger in diameter than the cheese so that\r\nthe latter can be easily placed in it. The sides of the box should be\r\nthe same height as the cheese.\r\n\r\nThe weight of each cheese should be neatly and accurately marked on each\r\nbox. Care should be exercised to keep the boxes clean.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEFECTS IN CHEDDAR CHEESE\r\n\r\nA great number of defects may occur in Cheddar cheese. Certain of these\r\nare due to known causes and proper remedies are definable, while neither\r\ncause nor remedy has been found for other defects. Some of the common\r\ndefects and their causes and remedies are discussed under different\r\nheadings of the score-card as: defects in flavor, their causes and\r\nremedies; defects in body and texture, their causes and remedies;\r\ndefects in color, their causes and remedies; defects in finish and their\r\ncauses and remedies.\r\n\r\n+251. Defects in flavor.+--Any flavor differing from the characteristic\r\nCheddar cheese is a defect. Certain of these defective flavors can be\r\nrecognized and causes and remedies given for them, while others may be\r\ndistinguished as such but no cause or remedy can be given.\r\n\r\n+252. Feedy flavors.+--Flavors may be characteristic of certain feeding\r\nstuffs. Feeding strong-flavored foods, such as turnips, cabbage, decayed\r\nsilage, certain weeds and sometimes rank green feed, give their peculiar\r\nflavors to both milk and cheese. Freshly drawn milk usually absorbs\r\nthese odors from the air in barns filled with such foods. Certain of\r\nthese materials may be fed just after milking in moderate amounts\r\nwithout affecting the milk drawn at the next milking. Others should not\r\nbe used. Milk should not be exposed to strong volatile odors. Some of\r\nthe objectionable odors may be removed by airing the curd for a longer\r\ntime after milling before the salt is applied.\r\n\r\n+253. Acid flavors.+--A cheese with an acid flavor has a pronounced sour\r\nsmell and taste. This is caused by the over-development of acid which\r\nmay be due to any of the following causes: (_a_) receiving milk at the\r\nfactory which is sour or has too high development of acid; (_b_) using\r\ntoo much starter; (_c_) ripening the milk too much before adding rennet;\r\n(_d_) not firming the curd sufficiently in the whey before removing the\r\nlatter; (_e_) developing too much acid in the whey before it is removed;\r\n(_f_) retaining too much moisture in the curd.\r\n\r\nThe trouble can be reduced or eliminated by one or more of the following\r\nprecautions: (_a_) receiving only clean, sweet milk at the cheese\r\nfactory; (_b_) maintaining the proper relation between the moisture and\r\nacidity; (_c_) adding the rennet at the proper acidity; (_d_) using less\r\nstarter; (_e_) adding the rennet extract so that there will be\r\nsufficient time to firm the curd before the acid has developed to such a\r\nstage that it will be necessary to draw the whey; (_f_) producing the\r\nproper final water-content in the newly made cheese.\r\n\r\n+254. Sweet or fruity flavors.+--These are the sweet flavors\r\ncharacteristic of strawberry, raspberry and the like. Such flavors are\r\nvery objectionable and usually increase with the age of the cheese. They\r\nappear to be caused by: (_a_) carrying both milk and whey in the same\r\ncans without properly cleaning them; (_b_) exposing milk near hog-pens\r\nwhere whey is fed; (_c_) dirty whey tanks at the cheese factory; (_d_)\r\nmicro-organisms which get into the milk through any unclean conditions.\r\n\r\nThese troubles can be controlled: (_a_) if milk and whey must be carried\r\nin the same cans, the cans should be emptied immediately on arrival at\r\nthe farm and thoroughly washed and scalded; (_b_) the whey vat at the\r\nfactory should be kept clean and sweet; (_c_) the starter must have the\r\nproper clean flavor.\r\n\r\nOther defects may be classed as \"off flavors,\" \"dirty flavors,\" \"bitter\r\nflavors\" and the like. These are undoubtedly due to unsanitary\r\nconditions whereby undesirable organisms get into the milk, even though\r\nthe particular organism is often not determined. The flavors may be\r\nimproved by the use of a clean-flavored commercial starter and by airing\r\nthe curd after milling before salting. The best remedy is to remove the\r\nsource of the difficulty.\r\n\r\n+255. Defects in body and texture.+--The body and texture should be\r\nclose. A sample rubbed between the thumb and fingers should be smooth\r\nand waxy. Any condition which causes a body and texture other than this\r\nis to be avoided.\r\n\r\n+256. Loose or open texture.+--A cheese with this defect is full of\r\nirregularly shaped holes and usually soft or weak-bodied. This is\r\nserious if the cheese is to be held for some time. Moisture and fat are\r\nlikely to collect in these holes and cause the cheese to deteriorate,\r\nthereby shortening its commercial life.\r\n\r\nSeveral causes may bring about this condition: (_a_) insufficient\r\ncheddaring; (_b_) pressing at too high a temperature; (_c_) inadequate\r\npressing; (_d_) development of too little acid.\r\n\r\nThe corresponding remedies are: (_a_) cheddar the curd until the holes\r\nare closed and the curd is solid; (_b_) cool the curd to 80° F. before\r\nputting to press; (_c_) press the curd longer, possibly twenty-four to\r\ntwenty-six hours; (_d_) develop a little higher acid in the whey before\r\nremoving the curd.\r\n\r\n+257. Dry body.+--A cheese with this defect is usually firm, hard and\r\ndry, sometimes rubbery or corky. This may result from lack of moisture,\r\nfat or both, and may be due to the following causes: (_a_) making the\r\ncheese from partly skimmed-milk; (_b_) heating the curd in the whey for\r\ntoo long a time; (_c_) heating the curd too high; (_d_) stirring the\r\ncurd too much in the whey or as the last of the whey is removed; (_e_)\r\nusing too much salt; (_f_) developing of too much acid in the whey;\r\n(_g_) curing the cheese in too hot or too dry a curing-room; (_h_) not\r\npiling the curd high or fast enough in the cheddaring process.\r\n\r\nThe cause should be located and the corresponding remedy found, as\r\nfollows: (_a_) make cheese only from whole milk; (_b_) draw the whey\r\nsooner; (_c_) firm the curd at as low temperature as possible in the\r\nwhey; (_d_) stir the curd in the whey only enough to keep the curd\r\nparticles separated but do not hand-stir it; (_e_) use less salt; (_f_)\r\ndevelop less acid in the whey; (_g_) cure the cheese in a cool moist\r\ncuring-room; (_h_) pile the curd sooner and higher during the cheddaring\r\nprocess.\r\n\r\nThe number of causes which may singly or in combination produce dry\r\ncheese demands experience and technical skill that calls for the\r\ndevelopment of a high degree of judgment.\r\n\r\n+258. Gassy textured cheese.+--Gassy cheese has large numbers of very\r\nsmall round or slightly flattened holes. When round these are called\r\n\"pin-holes,\" and when slightly flattened \"fish eye\" openings. These are\r\ndue to the formation of gas by the micro-organisms in the cheese. When a\r\ncheese is gassy, it usually puffs up from gas pressure as in the rising\r\nof bread. If enough gas is formed, it will cause the cheese to break or\r\ncrack open. Instead of being flat on the ends, such a cheese becomes so\r\nnearly spherical as to roll from the shelf at times.\r\n\r\nThe gas-producing organisms enter because of unclean conditions\r\nsomewhere in the handling of the milk and the making of the cheese.\r\nSome of the common sources of gas organisms are: (_a_) unclean milkers;\r\n(_b_) dirty cows; (_c_) aërating the milk in impure air, especially air\r\nfrom hog-pens where the whey is fed; (_d_) allowing the cows to wade in\r\nstagnant water or in mud or in filthy barnyards and then not thoroughly\r\ncleaning the cows before milking; (_e_) exposing the milk to the dust\r\nfrom hay and feed; (_f_) dirty whey tanks; (_g_) drawing milk and whey\r\nin the same cans without afterward thoroughly washing them; (_h_)\r\nunclean utensils in the factory; (_i_) using gassy starter; (_j_)\r\nripening cheese at high temperatures.\r\n\r\nSome of these causes are within the control of the cheese-maker after\r\nthe making process is begun. Many of them are avoided only by eternal\r\nvigilance. Among the recommendations for meeting gassy curd are the\r\nfollowing: use only milk produced under clean sanitary conditions; use a\r\nclean commercial starter.\r\n\r\nIf gas is suspected in the milk, a larger percentage of commercial\r\nstarter should be used. More acid must be developed before the whey is\r\nremoved. If the gas shows while cheddaring, the curd should be piled and\r\nrepiled until the holes flatten out before milling.\r\n\r\nThe curd should be kept warm during the piling or cheddaring process.\r\nThis may be accomplished by covering the vat and setting a pail or two\r\nof hot water in it. After milling, the curd should be stirred and aired\r\nfor a considerable length of time before salting. This will aërate the\r\ncurd and allow it to cool. The cheese should then be placed in a cool\r\ncuring-room. (See handling of gassy milk.)\r\n\r\n+259. Acidy, pasty or soft body and texture.+--A cheese with acidy body\r\nmay be either hard and dry or soft and moist. It has a mealy or sandy\r\nfeeling when rubbed between the fingers. The causes and remedies are the\r\nsame as for cheeses with acid flavors. When rubbed between the fingers,\r\nit is pasty and sticks to the fingers. It is caused by the cheese\r\ncontaining too much water. (See control of moisture.)\r\n\r\n+260. Defects in color.+--Any color which is not uniform is a defect.\r\nThe proper color depends on the market requirement. Some markets prefer\r\na white and others a yellow cheese; however, if the color is uniform, it\r\nis not defective.\r\n\r\n_Mottled color_ is a spotted or variegated marking of the cheese.\r\nSeveral causes may give the same general effect: (_a_) uneven\r\ndistribution of moisture, the curd having extra moisture being lighter\r\nin color; (_b_) neglecting to strain the starter; (_c_) adding the\r\nstarter after the cheese color has been added; (_d_) mixing the curd\r\nfrom different vats.\r\n\r\nRemedies for this mottled color are: (_a_) to maintain a uniform\r\nassimilation of moisture (see discussion of moisture); (_b_) to strain\r\nthe starter to break up the lumps before adding to the milk; (_c_) to\r\nadd all of the starter before adding the cheese color; (_d_) not to mix\r\ncurds from different vats.\r\n\r\n_Seamy color._--In \"seamy\" colored cheese, the outline of each piece of\r\ncurd may be seen. There is usually a line where the surfaces of the curd\r\ncome together. It may be caused by the pieces of curd becoming greasy or\r\nso cold that they will not cement. This may be remedied by having the\r\ncurd at a temperature of 80° to 85° F. when put to press. If it is\r\ngreasy, this may be removed by washing the curd in cold water.\r\n\r\n_Acid color._--This is a bleached or faded color and is caused by the\r\ndevelopment of too much acid. (See acid flavor for causes and remedies,\r\npage 266.)\r\n\r\n+261. Defects in finish.+--Defects of this class differ from those\r\npreviously mentioned in being entirely within the control of the\r\ncheese-maker. All are due to carelessness or lack of skill in\r\nmanipulation. Anything which detracts from the neat, clean, workmanlike\r\nappearance of the cheese is a defect that may interfere with the sale of\r\nan article intrinsically good. Some of the common defects are: (_a_)\r\nunclean surfaces or dirty cheese; (_b_) cracked rinds; (_c_) moldy\r\nsurfaces; (_d_) uneven sizes; (_e_) cracked cheese; (_f_) wrinkled\r\nbandages; (_g_) uneven edges.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHEDDAR CHEESE JUDGING\r\n\r\nJudging of cheese is the comparison of the qualities of one product with\r\nthose of another. To make this easier it is customary to reduce the\r\nqualities of the cheese to a numerical basis. This is accomplished by\r\nthe use of a score-card, which recognizes certain qualities and gives to\r\neach a numerical value. Each of these score-cards gives a perfect cheese\r\na numerical score of 100. Two score-cards are used to judge cheese, one\r\nfor export and the other for home-trade product. The latter is more\r\ncommonly used.\r\n\r\n  EXPORT SCORE-CARD       HOME-TRADE SCORE-CARD\r\n\r\n  Flavor            45    Flavor             50\r\n  Body and texture  30    Body and texture   25\r\n  Color             15    Color              15\r\n  Finish            10    Finish             10\r\n                   ---                      ---\r\n    Total          100      Total           100\r\n\r\nThe same qualities are recognized in each score-card, but different\r\nnumerical values are given them.\r\n\r\n+262. Securing the sample.+--The sample of cheese to be examined is best\r\nobtained by means of a cheese-trier (Fig. 55). This is a piece of steel\r\nabout five or six inches long fitted with a suitable handle. It is\r\nsemicircular in shape, about ½ to ¾ of an inch in diameter. The\r\nedges and end are sharpened to aid in cutting. This is inserted into the\r\ncheese and turned around and then drawn out. It removes a long cylinder\r\nof cheese, commonly called a \"plug.\" This plug should be drawn from the\r\ntop rather than from the side of the cheese, because when the bandage is\r\ncut it often splits, due to the pressure against it and so exposes the\r\ncheese.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 55.--A cheese-trier.]\r\n\r\n+263. How to determine quality.+--As soon as the plug has been removed,\r\nit should be passed quickly under the nose to detect any volatile odors\r\nwhich are liable to leave the cheese quickly. Next, the compactness of\r\nthe plug should be noticed and the color carefully examined. Then the\r\nouter end of the plug should be broken off and placed back in the cheese\r\nin the hole made by the trier. It should be about an inch long and\r\npushed in so that the surface of the cheese is smooth. This prevents\r\nmold and insects entering the cheese. Usually the cheese will mold after\r\na short time where the plug has been removed. The remainder of the plug\r\nshould be saved for determining the flavor and the body and texture.\r\n\r\nThe flavor can be determined by the first odor obtained from the cheese\r\non the trier and by mixing or crushing a piece of the plug between the\r\nthumb and fore-finger and then noting the odor. Mixing and thoroughly\r\nwarming causes the odor to be much more pronounced. The cheese should\r\nseldom be tasted to determine the flavor, for when many are to be\r\njudged, they all taste alike after the first five or six. This is\r\nprobably due to the cheese adhering to the teeth, tongue and other parts\r\nof the mouth, making it difficult to cleanse the mouth sufficiently. The\r\nbody and texture can be determined by the appearance and the feeling of\r\nthe cheese when rubbed between the thumb and fingers. The body and\r\ntexture are distinct, yet they are more or less interchanged. The body\r\nrefers to the cheese as a whole and the texture to the arrangement of\r\nthe parts of the whole. The openness of texture or the holes can be\r\nnoted when the plug is first removed. The firmness of body and\r\nsmoothness of texture can be determined when the cheese is rubbed\r\nbetween the thumb and fingers. The color can be judged when the plug is\r\nfirst removed. The finish or appearance may be noted either before or\r\nafter the other qualities by carefully examining the cheese.\r\n\r\nCheddar cheese should have a neat, clean, attractive appearance; when\r\ncut it should show a close, solid, uniformly colored interior. It should\r\nhave a clear, pleasant, mild aroma and a nutty flavor. It should possess\r\na mellow, silky, meaty texture and when rubbed between the thumb and\r\nfore-finger should be smooth and free from hard particles.\r\n\r\n\r\n  CHEESE SCORE-CARD\r\n\r\n  _Sample_................  _Date_......................\r\n\r\n  ===============================================================\r\n               SCORE                 REMARKS\r\n  ---------+-----+----------+------------------------------------\r\n  Flavor   |  50 | ........ |\r\n           |     |          |\r\n  Body and |     |          |\r\n   Texture |  25 | ........ |\r\n           |     |          |\r\n  Color    |  15 | ........ |\r\n           |     |          |\r\n  Finish   |  10 | ........ |\r\n  ---------+-----+----------+\r\n  Total    | 100 | ........ |\r\n  ---------+-----+----------+\r\n\r\n  Recommendations................................................\r\n\r\n  ...............................................................\r\n\r\n  ...............................................................\r\n\r\n  ...............................................................\r\n\r\n  ...............................................................\r\n\r\n  ...............................................................\r\n\r\n  ...............................................................\r\n\r\n  ...............................................................\r\n\r\n\r\n                       Name of Judge.............................\r\n  ---------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n  SUGGESTIVE TERMS\r\n\r\n  FLAVOR\r\n\r\n  _Desirable_\r\n\r\n  Clean   Pleasant Aroma  Nutty Flavor\r\n\r\n  _Undesirable_\r\n\r\n  +Due to Farm Conditions+\r\n\r\n  Weedy  Feedy  Cowy  Old Milk  Bitter\r\n\r\n  +Due to Factory Conditions+\r\n\r\n  Too much acid  Too little acid\r\n\r\n  +Due to either Farm or Factory Conditions+\r\n\r\n  Yeasty  Fruity  Fishy  Rancid  Sour  Bitter  Sweet  Tainted\r\n\r\n  BODY AND TEXTURE\r\n\r\n  _Desirable_\r\n\r\n  Smooth  Waxy  Silky  Close\r\n\r\n  _Undesirable_\r\n\r\n  Pasty  Corky  Acidy  Greasy  Loose  Sweet  Curdy\r\n  Gassy  Watery  Mealy  Lumpy  Yeasty  Too dry\r\n\r\n  COLOR\r\n\r\n  _Desirable_\r\n\r\n  Uniform\r\n\r\n  _Undesirable_\r\n\r\n  Streaked  White specks  Seamy  Mottled  Wavy  Rust spots\r\n  Acid cut  Too high  Too light\r\n\r\n  FINISH\r\n\r\n  _Desirable_\r\n\r\n  Clean surfaces  Neat bandage  Attractive\r\n\r\n  _Undesirable_\r\n\r\n  Wrinkled bandage  Unclean surfaces  Cracked rinds\r\n  Undesirable size  Greasy  No end caps  Uneven edges\r\n\r\n+264. Causes of variations in score.+--It is very seldom, if ever, that\r\na cheese is given a perfect score, for it usually has one or more\r\ndefects which may be hardly noticeable or very pronounced. The\r\nseriousness of the defect is determined by the individual tastes of the\r\njudges and the market requirements. It is customary for the judge to\r\npick out several samples and score them in order to fix the standard\r\nand if there are several judges this serves to unify their standard.\r\nOrdinarily judges will vary because of their individual tastes, unless\r\nthey begin with a uniform standard.\r\n\r\nCertain markets require cheese with given qualities which on other\r\nmarkets would be considered defects. For example, the Boston market\r\nrequires a very soft, pasty cheese which other markets would consider\r\nundesirable.\r\n\r\nThe cheese is constantly undergoing changes due to the ripening agents\r\nso that it may not always be scored the same. For example, a cheese may\r\nhave little or no flavor and after several weeks a very considerable\r\nflavor may have developed. This is probably due to the action of the\r\nripening agents, and therefore the second time it would be scored\r\ndifferently.\r\n\r\n+265. The score-card.+--When judging several samples of cheese, the type\r\nof score-card on the opposite page is used for each one.\r\n\r\nThis gives the date of judging and the sample number, the judge's name\r\nand reasons for cutting the score and recommendations to avoid these\r\ntroubles.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\n_THE SWISS AND ITALIAN GROUPS_\r\n\r\n\r\nCertain varieties of hard cheese of foreign origin are now made to some\r\nextent in this country. If not manufactured in sufficient quantities to\r\nsupply the demand, the remainder is imported. These hard cheeses are now\r\nconsidered.\r\n\r\n\r\nSWISS CHEESE\r\n\r\nSwiss cheese, variously known as Gruyère, Emmenthal, Schweitzer and\r\nSwiss, had its origin in the Alpine cantons of Switzerland. From this\r\nregion its manufacture has been carried by Swiss dairy-men and emigrant\r\nfarmers into widely separate lands. The Swiss colonies settled in the\r\nUnited States in the Mohawk Valley and in Cattaraugus County, New York;\r\nin Wayne, Stark, Summit, Columbiana and Tuscarawas counties of Ohio, and\r\nin Green and Dodge counties in Wisconsin. Of all these, the Wisconsin\r\ncolonies have become the most extensive. Similar colonies have developed\r\nthe making of this type of cheese in Sweden and Finland.\r\n\r\n+266. The Swiss factory.+--Swiss cheese cannot be made in a vat like\r\nother types for reasons that will be explained later. In place of the\r\nvat is used a kettle, generally of copper, and it may or may not be\r\njacketed for steam or for hot water (Fig. 56). These kettles vary in\r\ncapacity from 600 to 3000 pounds of milk. The cheese-maker takes the\r\nbest care possible of his kettle, for an unclean utensil is one of the\r\neasiest sources of contamination of the milk. When the kettle is not\r\njacketed, and it is only in recent years that this has been done, it is\r\nsuspended in a fireplace by means of a crane arrangement.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 56.--Swiss-cheese kettle.]\r\n\r\nThis fireplace uses wood, and is built of brick or stone, so that the\r\nkettle rests on the edge and is provided with a door which swings upon\r\nanother crane, and can be closed while the fire is going. When the\r\nkettle is swung on a crane, it is possible to swing it under the\r\nweigh-stand for filling. This requires a lid to swing down over the\r\nfire, and keep the room free from smoke. The chimney generally has a\r\nrather high stack to secure a good draft. This kettle is fastened to the\r\ncrane by a large iron band passing around the neck, to which a bail or\r\nhandle is attached. The kettle may be raised or lowered by means of a\r\nsimple screw on this beam. The crane consists of a heavy beam working in\r\nsockets in the floor and a beam or cross brace, which has another and\r\nshorter beam braced to it, to take the weight of the kettle.\r\n\r\nThe weigh-stand, and its efficient location, is a matter of extreme\r\nimportance. It is elevated a little above the remainder of the floor to\r\nallow gravity to do the work. The next most important equipment is the\r\npress and draining table. The table is made of wood or stone, and has a\r\nslight slope to allow the whey to drain off. The press is generally a\r\njack screw which, braced against a beam, will exert an enormous pressure\r\non the table below.\r\n\r\nSwiss cheeses are made in two styles, the \"round\" or drum and the\r\n\"block\" or rectangular forms, each of which has its advantages. For the\r\nround style, which is most commonly made, the forms for hooping are of\r\nmetal or of elm wood, and consist of strips of a given width, generally\r\nsix inches, but of an undetermined length. These strips are then made\r\ninto a circle and held by a cord, which is easily lengthened or\r\nshortened, thus varying the diameter of the hoop.\r\n\r\nBesides these hoops, cheese boards or followers are needed. These are\r\nheavy circular boards, of a size to fit that of the cheese generally\r\nmade, and are banded with iron around the edge and cross-braced on the\r\nbottom for rigidity. The small tools of the factory consist of knives to\r\ncut the curd, and of a \"Swiss harp\" or other similar tool to stir the\r\ncurd. Many clean bandages are also needed, and a kettle brake.\r\n\r\n+267. The milk.+--Swiss cheese requires clean sweet milk. Dirt, high\r\nacid and infections with undesirable bacteria involve difficulties of\r\nmanufacture and frequent losses of cheese. One common practice rejects\r\nmilk if it shows acidity above 0.15 per cent. To secure milk in this\r\ncondition, factories are small and located so close to the producing\r\nfarms as to secure 1000 to 3000 pounds of milk delivered warm from the\r\ncow twice a day. The cheese is made twice daily from this fresh milk.\r\nIf, however, milk is properly cared for, it is possible to mix night's\r\nand morning's milk without bad results. In fact, in working\r\nexperimentally with high grade milk and taking precautions against loss\r\nof fat, it has been necessary to skim (separate) part of the milk, thus\r\nreducing the ratio of fat to casein. Analysis of good Swiss cheeses\r\nshows that the desired texture is more uniformly obtained with milk in\r\nwhich the fat is less than the normal ratio. This assumes that the\r\nmanufacturing loss is kept down so that the fat removed offsets the\r\nextra loss from curd-breaking.\r\n\r\n+268. Rennet extract.+--Most Swiss cheese-makers prefer to make their\r\nown rennet extract from the stomach. This results in a product which is\r\nnot uniform in strength and so requires good judgment to secure the\r\ndesired coagulation in the allotted time. Some cheese-makers roll\r\nfifteen to twenty well salted calves' stomachs together and dry them.\r\nFrom this they cut off a definite amount each day to be soaked for\r\ntwenty-four hours in two to five quarts of whey at 86° F. Four quarts of\r\nthis solution added to 2000 pounds of milk at 90° F. should produce a\r\ncurd ready for cutting in twenty to thirty minutes.\r\n\r\n+269. Starter.+--Makers do not agree as to the use of \"starters\" for\r\nSwiss cheese. Those opposed to such use say that a starter will give the\r\ncheese a decided Cheddar flavor, while those in favor of it state that\r\nit will control undesirable fermentations, and that, with the use of a\r\nstarter, it is possible to make Swiss cheese throughout the year, and\r\nhave uniform success.\r\n\r\nDoane,[122] working with _Bacillus Bulgaricus_ as a starter, found that\r\nthese starters did not always overcome the undesirable fermentations. If\r\na cheese-maker is having difficulty to develop the holes or \"eyes,\" this\r\nmay be overcome by making a starter[123] as follows from good cheese and\r\nwhey or milk: Select a cheese which has the desirable \"eyes\" or holes\r\nand a good flavor. Grind up some of this and add about ¼ of a pound\r\nto one gallon of milk or whey. Hold this for twenty-four hours at a warm\r\ntemperature (85° to 90° F.). Strain it into the vat of milk just before\r\nthe rennet is added.\r\n\r\n+270. The making process.+--The milk is delivered twice a day without\r\ncooling. It usually reaches the factory at a temperature of 92° to 96°\r\nF. It is strained into the kettle, and starter and rennet added at the\r\nsame temperature as received. (For method of adding rennet, see Chapter\r\nV.) Enough rennet should be used to give a coagulation ready for cutting\r\nin twenty to thirty minutes. The firmness of the curd is tested by\r\ninserting the index finger in an oblique position, then raising it\r\nslightly and with the thumb of the same hand starting the curd to break\r\nor crack. When the curd is coagulated ready for cutting, it will give a\r\nclear break over the finger.\r\n\r\nIt is important to keep the temperature uniform while coagulation is in\r\nprocess, and this is best accomplished by the use of a little pan\r\narrangement which fits into the top of the kettle. When this is full of\r\nwater at 100° F., the temperature of the air above the milk will be\r\nabout 90° F. When the curd is ready for cutting, a scoop may be used and\r\nthe top layer carefully turned under to equalize the temperature more\r\nclosely.\r\n\r\n_Cutting the curd._--In some cheese factories, knives resembling Cheddar\r\ncheese knives are employed to cut the curd. In other factories, a \"Swiss\r\nharp\" is used to break the curd. The curd is usually cut or broken into\r\npieces about the size of kernels of corn. The practice of \"breaking\"\r\ncurd instead of cutting it with sharp curd-knives produces excessive\r\nloss at times. Experimental study has shown that the loss of fat may be\r\nkept as low as 0.3 per cent if modern curd-knives are substituted for\r\nthe breaking tool formerly used. Study of Swiss cheeses of all grades\r\nsupports the opinion that the removal of a small part of fat from usual\r\ngrades of factory milk produces a better quality of product than the use\r\nof rich whole milk. This may be accomplished through the escape of fat\r\nin the whey on account of breaking the curd and stirring it vigorously,\r\nor by skimming a part of the milk which is then curdled, cut and stirred\r\nunder such conditions as to minimize the loss of fat.\r\n\r\n_Cooking the curd._--After cutting, the curd is stirred in the whey for\r\nabout twenty minutes before the steam is turned on and is then heated to\r\n128° to 135° F. While this heating is in progress, constant stirring\r\nmust be given to avoid matting. This excessive stirring breaks the curd\r\nup into pieces about the size of wheat kernels, and accounts for the\r\nlarge fat loss, which is one of the main sources of loss in making Swiss\r\ncheese. This stirring is accomplished by a rotary motion, and the use of\r\na brake, which is a piece of wood closely fitting the side of the\r\nkettle. This creates an eddy in the current at that point and gives a\r\nmore uniform distribution of temperature. The process of cooking takes\r\nfrom thirty to forty minutes, and at the end of that time the degree of\r\ntoughness may be determined by making a roll of curd in the hand, and\r\nnoticing the break when it is given a quick flip. A short sharp break\r\nindicates the desired toughness.\r\n\r\n_Draining and hooping._--In this process, the cheese-makers' skill is\r\ndisplayed. With the hoop prepared, and the curd at the correct stage of\r\ntoughness, the operator takes a press cloth, wets it in whey, slips it\r\nover a flexible iron ring which can be made to fit the shape of the\r\nkettle, gives the contents of the kettle a few swift revolutions, then\r\nsuddenly reverses the motion, with the result that the contents form\r\ninto a cone, and the ring and bandage are dexterously slipped under this\r\ncone, and drawn up to the surface of the whey with a rope or chain and\r\npulley. This part of the process is the most important, as a cheese must\r\nhave a smooth firm rind, else it will quickly crack. With too large a\r\nbatch of milk, the curd can be cut into two pieces and hooped\r\nseparately. With the mass of curd at the top of the whey, the piece of\r\nperforated iron plate just the size of the hoop is slipped under the\r\nmass, and attached to the pulley by four chains. Then the top of the\r\nmass is carefully leveled off, because while still in the whey, it\r\ncannot mat badly and so tend to develop a rind crack. Now the mass is\r\nraised clear of the whey, and run along a short track to the drain\r\ntable, where it is put in the press.\r\n\r\n_Pressing._--The mass of curd is dropped into the hoop, the edges of the\r\ncloth carefully folded under, and the cloth laid on top, then the\r\npressure is applied, gradually at first, but increasing until the final\r\npressure is about fifteen to twenty pounds to a pound of cheese.\r\n\r\nDuring the first few hours the cloths must be changed frequently, and\r\nthe cheese carefully turned over each time, to secure a more uniform\r\nrind. After a time the changes are less frequent, and at the end of\r\ntwenty-four hours the cheese is taken to the salting-room.\r\n\r\n_Salting_ may be done by either the brine or dry method. To prepare a\r\nbrine bath, add salt to a tank of water until it will float an egg, and\r\nadd a pailful or more of salt every few days thereafter to keep up the\r\nstrength. The cheese is then placed in this bath and left for three to\r\nfive days, depending on the saltiness desired. As the cheese floats with\r\na little of the rind above the surface, it should be turned a few times\r\nto insure uniformity of salting. With dry salting, the salt is rubbed on\r\nthe cheese by hand or with a stiff brush, and any excess carefully wiped\r\noff, leaving only a slight sprinkle on the surface to work into the\r\ncheese.\r\n\r\n+271. Curing Swiss.+--From the salting-room, the cheese goes to the\r\nfirst one of two curing-rooms, where the unique process of the\r\ndevelopment of the characteristic eyes takes place.\r\n\r\nDuring the curing period of either round or block Swiss, constant\r\nattention must be paid to the cheese. They must be turned every day at\r\nfirst, and then every second or third day toward the end of the curing\r\nperiod. Also, great care must be taken that no mold starts growing, as\r\nit will soon work into the cheese, and spoil its flavor. The best way of\r\npreventing mold is by washing the cheese, in either clean or slightly\r\nsalted water, as often as possible. A stiff brush is mostly used for\r\nthis.\r\n\r\nThe development of the \"eyes\" or holes is the difficult part of the\r\nwhole process. It is not known exactly what causes the development, but\r\nit is attributed to micro-organisms or enzymes. The gas in these eyes\r\nhas been examined and found to be carbon dioxide and free nitrogen.\r\nSometimes hydrogen is found. This comes from the original fermentation\r\nof the milk-sugar and remains to contaminate the normal eye. The\r\nnitrogen[124] is included from the original air. Propionic acid is\r\nformed at the same time as the eyes, and they are said to be the result\r\nof a propionic ferment of lactic acid. The interior of the cheese is\r\nanaërobic, due to low permeability and high oxygen-absorbing quality.\r\nThis propionic bacterium cannot, however, account for all the carbon\r\ndioxide produced.\r\n\r\nAfter the eyes have started, their further development depends on\r\ntemperature and humidity of the air, and on the moisture of the cheese,\r\nas regulated by the amount of salt used. The first room has a\r\ntemperature of 70° F. to start the eyes, which is later lowered in the\r\nsecond curing-room to about 60° to check the development. When any local\r\nfermentive action starts, it may be checked by rubbing salt on the\r\naffected part. The humidity of the room is very important, because a\r\ncheese will quickly dry out in a dry room, due to evaporation from the\r\nsurface. To prevent this, it is well to spray the floor with water, or\r\nto have a steam jet in the room.\r\n\r\nIf the curd has been cooked too long the cheese may be too dry. Such\r\ncheeses may be piled two or more deep in the curing-room. It is held by\r\nsome cheese-makers that this process causes them to absorb more\r\nmoisture. Probably this is due to the checking of evaporation.\r\n\r\nThe development of the \"eyes\" may be watched by trying the following\r\ntest: Place the middle finger on the cheese and let the first finger\r\nslip from it, striking the cheese smartly; a dull sound indicates\r\nsolidity, while a ring indicates a hole, and an expert maker can tell\r\nthe size of the holes by the sound. This requires long practice for the\r\noperator to become proficient.\r\n\r\nAfter a cheese has remained in the first room for about two weeks and\r\nthe holes are well started, it is removed to the second curing-room,\r\nwhich is held at a cooler temperature and slightly drier atmosphere. The\r\ncheeses are held in this room from three to ten months, depending on\r\nmarket conditions, and capacity of the curing-rooms. In Switzerland, it\r\nis customary to hold cheese to secure a well ripened product, while in\r\nAmerica most of the cheeses are shipped comparatively green, hence do\r\nnot bring so high a price.\r\n\r\n+272. Block Swiss.+--In making block Swiss, the same procedure is\r\nfollowed through the cooking stage. Then the curd is pressed in a square\r\nform or in one large piece, each form six inches square on the ends and\r\ntwenty inches long, and later cut into sections. These are then pressed,\r\nsalted and cured in the same way as round forms. In this type of cheese\r\nthere is a much smaller cross-section; therefore the development of\r\nholes is much more easily controlled on account of the ease with which\r\nthe salt can work into the cheese and control undesirable ferments. As\r\nit is easy to control, this variety is made in the fall and winter when\r\nthe ferments are especially hard to keep in check. However, this cheese\r\nhas the disadvantage of cutting eye-development short by the rapid\r\nentrance of salt.\r\n\r\nThe curing consists of the developing of the flavor and eyes and the\r\nchanging in body and texture. Just what causes these changes is not\r\nknown.\r\n\r\n+273. Shipment.+--When ready for shipment, the drum cheeses of the same\r\ngeneral diameter are sorted out and packed four to six in a cask. Care\r\nmust be taken to put boards between them to prevent sticking. These are\r\ncalled scale-boards, and are made of thin sections of wood fiber. The\r\ncheeses are crowded into the cask to make a snug fit, and the head\r\ncarefully fastened.\r\n\r\n+274. Qualities of Swiss cheese.+--The peculiar Swiss cheese flavor may\r\nbe characterized as a hazel-nut taste. It is a trifle sweet and very\r\ntempting. The \"eyes\" or holes should be about the size of a cherry with\r\na dull shine to the inner lining. The \"eyes\" usually contain a small\r\namount of a briny tasting liquid. These eyes should be uniformly\r\ndistributed. The color should be uniform. The cheese should have a neat,\r\nclean, attractive appearance, and the rind should not be cracked or\r\nbroken.\r\n\r\nThere are several common defects in Swiss cheese. If the milk is not\r\nclean-flavored, the cheese will have the same flavor as the milk. The\r\ngreatest difficulty is to produce the eyes or holes. A cheese which does\r\nnot have these is called \"blind.\" A product which has many small\r\npin-holes due to gassy fermentations is called a \"niszler\"; this means a\r\ncheese with a thousand eyes. If gas forms in the cheese and causes\r\ncracks, it is called \"glaesler.\" If the cheese contains too much\r\nmoisture, it will be soft and pasty. Such a cheese does not readily form\r\neyes.\r\n\r\n+275. Composition and yield.+--A large number of analyses of Swiss\r\ncheese have been made but there is wide variation. This is due to the\r\nfact that the composition and yield are both dependent on the following\r\nfactors: composition of the milk, losses during manufacture, amount of\r\nmoisture in the cheese. The losses in Swiss cheese are much larger than\r\nwith some of the other hard cheeses, such as Cheddar. This is because\r\nmore fat is lost in the whey, due to breaking instead of cutting the\r\ncurd and the subsequent hard stirring. The possibility of reducing these\r\nexcessive losses has already been indicated.\r\n\r\nSwiss cheeses of high grade show about the following range of\r\ncomposition:\r\n\r\n  Water         30-34 per cent\r\n  Fat           30-34 per cent\r\n  Protein       26-30 per cent\r\n  Ash           3-5 per cent\r\n  Salt (NaCl)   1-1.4 per cent\r\n\r\nThe water-content of this type of cheese is low and the protein-content\r\nis proportionately high. Both conditions lead to firm textures, long\r\nripening and long keeping periods.\r\n\r\nThe following score-card is used to judge both block and drum Swiss\r\ncheese:\r\n\r\n  Flavor                        35\r\n  Appearance on trier holes     30\r\n  Texture                       20\r\n  Salt                          10\r\n  Style                          5\r\n                              ----\r\n                               100\r\n\r\nThe yield of Swiss cheese varies from 8 to 11 pounds to 100 pounds of\r\nmilk. The more solids in the milk, the more moisture incorporated in\r\nthe cheese; the smaller the loss of solids in the manufacturing process,\r\nthe larger will be the yield from a given amount of milk.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ITALIAN GROUP[125]\r\n\r\nA group of varieties, best known in America by Parmesan, are made in\r\nItaly with related forms in Greece and European Turkey. These forms are\r\nvery hard, usually uncolored, with small eyes or holes. They are made in\r\nlarge cheeses which ripen very slowly. Cow's milk is regularly used for\r\nParmesan and Grana in northern Italy; other varieties contain goat or\r\nsheep milk or various mixtures. Aside from Parmesan, few of the other\r\nforms are known outside the place of origin except as they are exported\r\nin a small way to satisfy the demand of emigrants from these regions.\r\n\r\n+276. Parmesan.+--One type of Italian cheese, however, the Parmesan, has\r\nbecome very widely known. In general the consuming trade does not\r\ndiscriminate between Parmesan, Grana and closely related forms. Parmesan\r\nis made in large cheeses which require one to three years for proper\r\nripening; in texture it is very hard with small eyes or holes formed by\r\nvery slow fermentation. Such cheeses are ripened in large storehouses in\r\nwhich hundreds and even thousands are brought together and cared for by\r\nexperts. The surfaces of these cheeses are kept clean and free from\r\ninsects by rubbing with linseed oil. So hard are these forms that the\r\ncheese-trier is not used in testing, but the texture of the surface is\r\ntested by pricking with an awl-like tool and the stage of eye-formation\r\nand associated ripening is determined by the sound given out when the\r\ncheeses are tapped with a hammer.\r\n\r\nWhen ripe, the cheeses of this group are used in cooking principally.\r\nThe broken cheese is grated and added to macaroni, spaghetti and other\r\ncooked cheese dishes. Parmesan is usually made from partly skimmed-milk;\r\nthe ratio of fat to protein in analysis runs from 1:2 to 3:4 in contrast\r\nto the normal relation of about 4:3 in whole-milk cheese. In\r\nwater-content much variation is found, but ripe Parmesan is usually\r\nabout 30 per cent water. Other members of the group are made with\r\ndifferent amounts of skimming, some of them from whole milk. The group\r\nin general represents the requirements of cheese for the trade of warmer\r\nregions (see Mayo and Elling): (1) a low fat-content so incorporated\r\nthat the cheese does not become greasy or oily in hot weather; (2) a\r\nwater-content low enough to prevent rapid spoilage during the necessary\r\nexposure of handling under warm conditions.\r\n\r\nThe equipment for Parmesan manufacture has more resemblance to that of\r\nthe Swiss factory than the English and American cheeses. The milk is\r\ncurdled in deep copper kettles (Fig. 57), below which there is commonly\r\na provision for direct heating by fire which is sometimes carried on a\r\ntruck, and therefore can be withdrawn when heating is sufficient. The\r\nsteam-jacketed kettle has replaced this earlier form to a large measure.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 57.--Parmesan cheese kettles.]\r\n\r\nThe general character of the manufacturing process is indicated in the\r\nfollowing abstract of one of the methods. Many variations are to be\r\nfound. The milk for Parmesan is allowed to stand overnight. Some acidity\r\nis, therefore, developed in contrast to the absolutely fresh condition\r\nof the milk used in Swiss and the acidification developed during the\r\nmaking of Cheddar (Fascetti). It is then skimmed, heated to 72° to 75°\r\nF. Rennet is added in amount sufficient to produce firm curd in one hour\r\nor slightly less. When the curd is firm, a wood fire is made under the\r\nkettle and the curd is broken with a special implement into small\r\nparticles. After breaking, four grains of powdered sulfur to twenty-two\r\ngallons of milk are added. The curd is stirred with a rake. By the time\r\nthe temperature rises to 77° F., the curd should be in very small\r\npieces. Stirring and heating continue until the temperature reaches 131°\r\nF. At this temperature, it stands fifteen minutes, after which it is\r\nremoved from the fire (or the fire is drawn). Nine-tenths of the whey is\r\nthen drawn. The cheese-maker then collects the curd into a compact lump\r\nunder which he slips a cheese cloth. With the aid of an assistant he\r\nremoves the mass to a perforated vessel for draining. After this the\r\ncurd goes into large wooden hoops, lined with cloth, which stand upon a\r\nslanting draining table until evening. No pressure is used. Before\r\nnight they are taken to the cellar. The cloths are removed next day.\r\nAfter standing four days, they are salted by covering the upper surface\r\nwith coarse salt. This is repeated with daily turning for twenty days,\r\nthen salted on alternate days for another period of twenty days. At the\r\nend of the forty days' salting, the cheese is removed from the hoop,\r\nscraped, sprinkled with whey and the rind rubbed smooth. A dressing of\r\nlinseed oil either with or without bone black is applied.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 58.--A typical cheese-market in France.]\r\n\r\nThe cheeses are kept in special ripening rooms, and rubbed frequently\r\nwith linseed oil to keep the surfaces free from molds and vermin.\r\nCareful grading as to quality of product and consequent response to\r\nripening conditions produce cheeses of many degrees of excellence.\r\nThose in which a ripening of three to four years is possible are most\r\nhighly esteemed.\r\n\r\n+277. Regianito.+--A cheese of the Italian group is now made in\r\nArgentina and imported to the United States under the name Regianito.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\n_MISCELLANEOUS VARIETIES AND BY-PRODUCTS_\r\n\r\n\r\nAs already discussed in Chapter VI, there are a large number of\r\nvarieties of cheese. Very many are entirely unknown in America. A\r\nconsiderable number of forms are occasionally imported and may be found\r\nby visiting the markets and delicatessen stores in the foreign districts\r\nof our large cities. Certain forms not widely known are made in America\r\nin a few factories or are imported in sufficient quantity to call for\r\nbrief discussion. Some of these are brought together here.\r\n\r\nThe importance of the by-products of cheese-making has not been\r\nsufficiently recognized, for manufacture on a large scale is only\r\nbeginning to be appreciated in America. Certain cheese names, such as\r\nMysost, are applied to whey products. In addition, milk-sugar is\r\nextensively made and whey-butter has been carefully studied and found to\r\nbe practicable under some conditions.\r\n\r\n+278. Caciocavallo+ originated in Italy, but is now made in certain\r\nfactories of New York and Ohio. Some factories in Lombardy[126] use\r\nwhole milk, others use half-skimmed milk. The latter practice is\r\nprobably the more common. In making this cheese, the milk is coagulated\r\nwith rennet, cut and firmed in the whey, allowed to settle and the whey\r\ndrawn. The curd is then piled on the draining table and allowed to mat\r\nor fuse into fairly solid masses. After several hours of draining and\r\nmatting, the curd is cut into strips and placed in a vat of hot water.\r\nIn the hot water, the blocks of solid curd melt into taffy-like masses\r\nwhich are worked and molded by hand into more or less standard shapes.\r\nIndian club or ten-pin forms are most commonly produced. When the proper\r\nshape has been gained, each mass is thrown into cold water which\r\nsolidifies it in that form. Cheese masses heat and cool slowly; several\r\nhours of cooling are required to insure a firm cheese. The newly made\r\ncheeses are salted in a brine bath, then hung by a string to ripen.\r\nSometimes these cheeses are eaten fresh, again they are ripened several\r\nmonths. They vary in size from one to six pounds. Cornalba gives the\r\ncomposition of Italian Caciocavallo made from whole milk as water 32 to\r\n34 per cent, fat 34 to 36 per cent, protein 28.5 to 29.5 per cent, salt\r\n1.7 to 1.8 per cent; when made from half skimmed-milk, water 28 per\r\ncent, fat 27 to 28 per cent, protein 35 to 40 per cent, salt 2.2 per\r\ncent. Other analyses vary widely from these figures on account of the\r\ndiffering fat-content of the milk. No standardized practice has been\r\nestablished in America.\r\n\r\n_Provolono_ resembles Caciocavallo in method of manufacture and\r\ncomposition, the main difference being in the shape of the cheese. It is\r\nmore or less round and is held by a coarse net made of small rope. The\r\ncheeses are treated while curing the same as Caciocavallo.\r\n\r\n+279. Sap sago.+--This hard green cheese imported from Switzerland is\r\nmade in cakes, tapering from perhaps two inches in diameter to a rounded\r\ntop with a height of about two inches. These are made from skimmed-milk\r\ncurd, partially ripened then mixed with powdered leaves of _Melilotus\r\ncoeruleus_, a clover-like plant. The mixture is then pressed into the\r\nmarket form and dried until very hard. It is handled without special\r\ncare since the water-content is so low that fermentations are\r\nexceedingly slow. This low-priced cheese may be used in cooking.\r\n\r\n+280. Albumin cheese.+[127]--In the rennet cheeses, the albumin, which\r\nconstitutes about 0.7 per cent of the milk, passes off in the whey. This\r\nalbumin is not curdled by rennet. It is, however, coagulated by heating.\r\nThe presence of acid hastens such coagulation but does not cause it when\r\nused alone. When the whey is heated to about 200° F., the albumin rises\r\nand may be skimmed off. In this form it is recovered and used. It may be\r\nshaped is hoops under pressure, as Ricotte, an Italian form. This cheese\r\nis pressed firmly and dried. Such albumin is frequently prepared as a\r\npoultry feed.\r\n\r\n+281. Mysost, Norwegian whey cheese.+--The whey contains nearly 5 per\r\ncent of milk-sugar which can be recovered by boiling. The Norwegian\r\nprocess which produces Mysost consists in raising the whey to the\r\nboiling point, skimming off the albumin as it rises, then concentrating\r\nthe remainder of the whey. As it reaches sufficient concentration, the\r\nalbumin is thoroughly stirred back into the mass and the mass finally\r\ncooled into forms. Mysost is a brown, hard brittle mass consisting\r\nprincipally of caramelized milk-sugar. Analysis shows such percentage\r\ncomposition as follows: water 10 to 20 per cent, protein 10 to 15 per\r\ncent, milk-sugar 30 to 55 per cent. Mysost is found in the larger\r\nmarkets of the United States.\r\n\r\n_Primost_ is an albumin cheese somewhat similar to Ricotte and Mysost.\r\nIt is made by precipitating the albumin by acid and heat. The main\r\ndifference is in the firmness of the cheese. This is regulated by\r\ndrying.\r\n\r\n+282. Whey butter.+[128]--The loss of a percentage of fat, rarely less\r\nthan 0.3 per cent and in some cheeses very much greater, has led to the\r\nmaking of whey butter. For this purpose a separator is introduced and\r\nall whey is separated daily. The fat recovered in the form of cream is\r\nthen ripened and churned. Whey butter is not rated as equal to butter\r\nmade from whole milk but a fair market can usually be found for the\r\nproduct. The recovery of 0.25 per cent fat means two and one-half pounds\r\nof fat to 1000 pounds of whey. This will make about three pounds of\r\nbutter.\r\n\r\nWhether whey butter shall be made depends on the volume of business, the\r\nextra equipment required, the extra help necessary and the market for\r\nthe product. As a rule, whey butter is economically recoverable only in\r\nlarge factories. It is not considered advisable to attempt to make it\r\nunless one has the whey from 10,000 pounds of milk. In some instances,\r\nthe combination of small cheese factories with one churning plant has\r\nproved to be economical. The objection to the making of whey butter is,\r\nthat it stimulates carelessness on the part of the cheese-maker because\r\nhe thinks that the fat will be recovered by skimming. He does not\r\nrealize that the other milk solids are being reduced in the same\r\nproportion as the fat, to the great loss in yield of cheese.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\n_CHEESE FACTORY CONSTRUCTION, EQUIPMENT, ORGANIZATION_\r\n\r\n\r\nThe principal factor in determining the location of a cheese factory is\r\nthe available supply of milk. This is usually ascertained by making a\r\ncanvass, and finding out the number of cows whose milk would be brought\r\nto the factory. The quantity of milk or the number of cows necessary to\r\ninsure sufficient milk for the successful operation of the factory,\r\ndepends on the variety of cheese to be made. When making types of cheese\r\nfor which very sweet milk is necessary, the milk must be delivered twice\r\na day. This demand limits the area from which the factory can secure its\r\nsupply. The length of time the cheeses are held in the curing-room and\r\nthe work necessary to care for them also limits the area which the\r\nfactory can serve, because a very large amount of milk cannot be handled\r\nwhen the cheese must be given considerable attention in the\r\ncuring-rooms. Swiss, Limburger and Brick cheese factories usually do not\r\nrequire a large supply of milk; therefore the factories may be built\r\nclose together. The size of the Cheddar cheese factories varies but it\r\nis generally considered unprofitable to make Cheddar cheese unless there\r\nare 5000 pounds of milk available daily. Conditions have changed so that\r\nat present different kinds of cheese are made from the surplus milk in\r\nmarket milk plants. In such cases a uniform supply is not absolutely\r\nnecessary. The climate must also be suitable for the industry.\r\n\r\n+283. Locating the site.+--In a farming community, several factory sites\r\nare usually available. It is best to consider carefully the desirable\r\nfeatures of each before trying to make a definite choice. Many of the\r\npresent cheese factories were located in hollows because it was easy to\r\nsecure a supply of water, but no thought or attention was given to the\r\ndisposal of the sewage. The following points should be considered in\r\nchoosing a site:\r\n\r\n(1) _Drainage._--A factory should be so located that it has good\r\ndrainage. Ground that slopes away from the factory makes the disposal of\r\nsewage easy. Sewage should not be allowed to run out on the ground and\r\nleft to decay, thus forming a breeding place for flies, but should run\r\ninto a cesspool or septic tank.[129] Even in a porous soil, a cesspool\r\nfrequently clogs and gives trouble. The septic tank seems to be the best\r\nmethod to dispose of the sewage unless the factory is so located that\r\nconnection can be made with a city sewage system.\r\n\r\n(2) _Water._--An abundant supply of pure water is essential to a\r\nfactory. This may come either from deep wells or springs. The value of a\r\nnever-failing water supply cannot be overestimated.\r\n\r\n(3) _Exposure._--The factory should be so located that the receiving\r\nroom is away from the prevailing winds. This prevents dust being blown\r\ninto the factory. The curing-room should be on the side not exposed to\r\nthe sun as this will keep it cool. Fig. 59 shows a clean cheese factory\r\nof the ordinary type. When it is desirable to cure the cheese in a\r\ncellar, it is better to locate the factory on the side of a hill. Then\r\nthe receiving and manufacturing room may be on the ground level and the\r\ncuring-room, a cellar, back of the manufacturing room and yet all on\r\nthe same level. This saves carrying the cheese up and down stairs.\r\n\r\n(4) _Accessibility to market_ should not be overlooked. Often the\r\nquality of the cheese is injured by long hauls. An important item in\r\nmarketing both milk and cheese is the use of the automobile. By its use\r\nthe products are not so long in transit, and losses from exposure in\r\ndelivery are reduced. Both milk and cheese, when exposed to the heat of\r\nthe sun for any length of time, become warm. This gives undesirable\r\norganisms chance to develop.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 59.--A cheese factory of neat appearance.]\r\n\r\n+284. The building.+--Details of construction or estimates of cost will\r\nbe omitted in the present discussion. A local contractor can do this\r\nsatisfactorily and also the cost of materials is constantly changing.\r\nOnly general considerations as they apply to the manufacture of the\r\nproduct will be taken up.\r\n\r\nThe building may be constructed of wood, stone, various bricks or\r\nconcrete. The kind of material will depend on the relative cost of\r\nmaterials in the local market and on the amount of money available for\r\nbuilding.\r\n\r\n+285. Heating plant.+--Many of the older factories have no heating\r\nplants and some are so poorly constructed that they cannot be warmed.\r\nMeans of heating should be provided, either by steam or a stove. The\r\nloss due to freezing is an item which is entirely avoided in factories\r\nproperly heated.\r\n\r\n+286. Curing-rooms.+--The size of the curing-rooms will depend on the\r\namount of cheese to be handled and its location on the variety of cheese\r\nto be manufactured. In every case, some provision should be made to\r\ncontrol humidity and temperature. If the room becomes hot and dry,\r\nevaporation from the cheese will be much more rapid. In a hot\r\ncuring-room, undesirable types of ferments are more likely to develop\r\nand to injure the quality of the cheese.\r\n\r\n+287. Light.+--The importance of light should be emphasized. It acts as\r\na stimulant to keep things clean. It also makes the factory more\r\ncheerful. There should be numerous windows to give plenty of light. A\r\nskylight may often serve both as a source of light and ventilation.\r\n\r\n+288. Ventilation.+--Plenty of ventilation should be provided. This may\r\nbe accomplished by means of the windows or skylight. However, it is a\r\ngood precaution to have at least one ventilator to carry off the steam\r\nand control the circulation of air. All openings should be carefully\r\nscreened to keep out flies.\r\n\r\n+289. Boiler-room.+--The boiler-room should be easily accessible from\r\nthe manufacturing rooms. A gauge located in the latter should tell the\r\nsteam pressure. Windows or doors should be so located that the flues of\r\nthe boiler can be cleaned. The coal supply should be handy. Great care\r\nshould be exercised to keep the boiler-room clean for otherwise the dirt\r\nwill be tracked all over the factory.\r\n\r\n+290. Whey tanks+ should be kept clean. Daily washing is absolutely\r\nnecessary to prevent offensive odors. Pasteurization of whey has been\r\nfound requisite to prevent the spread of disease if raw milk is\r\nused.[130] This is required by law in some states. It is sometimes\r\naccomplished by heat with steam coils; in other cases by running live\r\nsteam directly into the whey. Whey tanks may be made of wood or steel.\r\nThe acid of the whey seems to eat and decompose concrete.\r\n\r\n+291. Store-room.+--There should be a separate room or a place in the\r\nattic where the supplies can be kept. This saves much waste and keeps\r\nthe factory cleaner and more tidy.\r\n\r\n+292. The floors.+--The floor is the most important part of the\r\nbuilding. It should be of non-absorbent material, which can be easily\r\ncleaned, and it should not leak. Concrete makes the best floor of any\r\nmaterial used at present. It should slope very gently to the drain. The\r\ncorners between the floor and side walls should be rounding to make\r\ncleaning easy. The drain should be provided with bell traps to prevent\r\nthe entrance of sewer gas into the factory. If the traps and floor about\r\nthem are slightly depressed, it will help to make the floor drain more\r\nquickly. A catch-basin should be provided just outside the factory for\r\nall solid material which might clog the sewer pipe. This should be\r\ncleaned three or four times a year.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 60.--A well arranged Cheddar cheese factory,\r\nincluding the equipment for the manufacture of whey butter.]\r\n\r\n+293. Arrangement of machinery and rooms.+--The rooms and machinery\r\nshould be arranged so that the work will follow the natural sequence of\r\nthe process with as little inconvenience as possible. Some of the points\r\nto be observed in this connection are: vats should be near the\r\nweigh-can; boiler-room near the work room; cheese presses near the vats;\r\ncheese presses near the curing-rooms and the like.\r\n\r\nFig. 60 shows a well arranged Cheddar cheese factory. The necessary\r\nmachinery and rooms for the manufacture of whey butter are included. In\r\nthis plan, the attic contains the store-room and the whey tanks. The\r\nwhey is forced from the vats into the tanks with a steam jet and then\r\nruns by gravity to the separator. Slides are provided in the walls of\r\nthe ice storage to regulate the flow of air into the curing-room and\r\nbutter refrigerator. In order to have a smaller boiler, a gasolene\r\nengine is used to run the separator, churn and curd-mill. The plan can\r\nbe modified to use the upstairs for a curing-room so that the size of\r\nthe factory may be reduced. The whey butter could be shifted to a small\r\nroom where the curing-room now is and the boiler-room added as a\r\n\"lean-to\" at one side of the building. This would materially reduce the\r\nsize of the main building.\r\n\r\nAnother plan (Fig. 61) shows the arrangement of a Cheddar cheese factory\r\nwithout the whey butter apparatus. The location of the drain between the\r\nvats might be criticized. In Fig. 62 is shown the arrangement of a\r\ncombined butter and cheese factory. Fig. 63 shows the possible\r\narrangement of a Limburger factory. The size of this factory could be\r\nreduced by having the salting tables closer together.\r\n\r\nIn a Cheddar cheese factory, the curing-room may be over the\r\nmanufacturing room. This makes considerable work in carrying the cheese\r\nup and down. A small elevator may be used for this purpose. The same\r\nprinciple holds in cheese factories in which other varieties of cheese\r\nare made; the floors should be on one level so far as possible. There\r\nis danger of the overhead curing-room becoming too hot and causing the\r\ncheese to leak fat. Shelves or tables should be provided on which to\r\nput and keep the utensils. The utensils should never be placed on the\r\nfloor.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 61.--Plan of Cheddar cheese factory without whey\r\nbutter equipment. 1, Boiler; 2, sink; 3, hot water barrel for scalding\r\nutensils; 4, cheese vats; 5, 6, cheese presses; 7, weigh-can; 8, desk;\r\n9, Babcock tester; 10, shelf; 11, paraffine tank; 12, cheese shelves.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 62.--Combined Cheddar cheese and butter factory.\r\n\r\n1, Boiler; 2, engine; 3, water pump; 4, work bench; 5, wash sink; 6,\r\npress; 7, elevator; 8, cheese vats; 9, separator; 10, milk heater; 11,\r\nmilk receiving vat; 12, press; 13, shelf; 14, Babcock tester; 15,\r\nweigh-can; 16, churn; 17, starter; 18, cream ripener and pasteurizer;\r\n19, refrigerator; 20, milk sheet and sample jar; 21, milk pump.]\r\n\r\n+294. Arrangements for cleanliness.+--A sink for washing the utensils\r\nshould be provided and boiling water to scald them after washing. After\r\nbeing scalded, tin utensils dry quickly without rusting. The boiling\r\nwater may be obtained by placing a steam pipe in a barrel of water and\r\nturning on the steam. The utensils can then be washed clean, dipped in\r\nthis barrel of boiling water and put in their place. Too much emphasis\r\ncannot be laid on keeping the factory itself, the utensils and the\r\nsurroundings clean. This will prevent the development of mold. Cases are\r\nknown in which the cheese factory was allowed to become very dirty, so\r\nthat a red mold developed. This eventually got into the cheese and\r\ncaused red spots.[131] They are called rust spots. All doors and windows\r\nshould be screened to keep out flies.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 63.--A Limburger cheese factory.]\r\n\r\n+295. Equipment and supplies list.+--The following utensils will be\r\nneeded in a Cheddar cheese factory to handle 10,000 pounds of milk\r\ndaily: 1 5-H. P. boiler; 1 60-gallon weigh-can; 1 conductor head and\r\ntrough; 1 platform scale; 1 Babcock tester, glassware and sample\r\nbottles; 2 700-gallon cheese vats; 2 gang cheese presses; 1 curd-mill; 2\r\ncurd-knives; 30 cheese hoops; 1 whey strainer; 1 curd scoop; 1\r\nlong-handled dipper; 1 strainer dipper; 1 siphon; 1 cheese knife; 1\r\nglass graduate; 1 cheese-trier; 1 speed knife; 1 paraffine tank; 1\r\nMarschall rennet test; 1 lactometer; 1 milk can hoist; 1 acid test; 1\r\nsink; 1 40-quart milk can; 3 pails; 3 shot-gun cans for starter; 3\r\nthermometers; brushes and brooms; 1 Wisconsin curd test or fruit jars\r\nfor same; 1 set counter scales; 2 curd rakes.\r\n\r\nIf whey butter is made, the equipment should include: Tanks to hold the\r\nwhey; separator; cream ripening vat; churn; butter-worker; butter\r\nrefrigerator; large boiler and steam engine or gasolene engine.\r\n\r\nThe following supplies will be needed for the making of the cheese:\r\nBandages; boxes; scale boards; starched circles; rennet extract or\r\npepsin; cheese color; press cloths; paraffine; formaldehyde; alkali;\r\nindicator; sulfuric acid.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 64.--A sanitary dipper with a solid handle.]\r\n\r\nWhen choosing the utensils, the ease of cleaning and sanitary\r\nconstruction should not be overlooked. One of the most unsanitary\r\nutensils in a factory is a dipper with a hollow handle. Fig 64 shows a\r\ndipper with a solid handle which any tinsmith can make. The seams of all\r\nutensils should be flushed full of solder, to make cleaning easy. When\r\nready to clean or wash any utensils which have come in contact with milk\r\nor its products, the steps are as follows: rinse in cold water, wash in\r\nwarm water in which some washing-soda has been dissolved, rinse clean,\r\nscald in boiling water. Never use a cloth to wash utensils; a brush is\r\nmore sanitary.\r\n\r\n+296. Factory organization.+--There are two general classes of\r\norganizations[132] to operate cheese factories, one the proprietary and\r\nthe other the coöperative. Unless the kind of organization is what the\r\ndairy-men desire, dissatisfaction is sure to result.\r\n\r\n(1) _Proprietary organization._--Under this form of organization, one\r\nperson owns and operates the factory. The dairy-men are paid a stated\r\nprice for milk, or the milk is made into cheese for a stated price a\r\npound. The proprietor receives all profits and assumes all losses.\r\n\r\nSo far as the dairy-man is concerned, the stock company is a proprietary\r\norganization. The gains and losses are shared by each member according\r\nto the amount of money invested.\r\n\r\n(2) _Coöperative organization._--In a true coöperative cheese factory\r\neach patron is an owner, as the name indicates. The object of this\r\norganization is to reduce the cost of manufacture rather than pay large\r\ndividends, so that the dairy-man with a large herd and small capital\r\ninvested in the factory obtains more returns than the one who owns\r\nconsiderable capital and has a small herd. Many cheese factories are\r\ncoöperative in name only and proprietary in operation. The state of\r\nWisconsin has a law which tends to stop this defect and defines what\r\norganizations may use the term or name, coöperative.\r\n\r\nThe constitution of a coöperative organization should state: 1, Name; 2,\r\nobject; 3, officers and duties of officers; 4, manager or other person\r\nto run business; 5, capital stock; 6, meetings; 7, voting power; 8,\r\namendments.\r\n\r\nSome of the most important statements which should appear in the\r\nconstitution are mentioned in the following sentences. A statement\r\nshould show what persons are eligible to membership in the organization.\r\nIt is a careless plan simply to say that the duties of the officers are\r\nthose usually defined in such an organization. This may lead to\r\nconfusion and neglect, or both. Direct statements should be made\r\nexplaining the exact duties of each officer. The limits of the authority\r\nof the manager or person who runs the business should be explicitly\r\nstated. The manager then knows just what his duties are and what matters\r\nor parts of the business must be considered by other officers or\r\ncommittees. The amount of capital stock and the number and value of each\r\nshare should be exactly stated. The constitution should state when and\r\nwhere the regular meetings must be held and by whom and when special\r\nmeetings may be called. This gives every member ample notice of the\r\nregular meetings. Some method or means should be provided to notify each\r\nmember of the special meetings.\r\n\r\nThe voting power should be definitely stated, whether it is limited to\r\nshares of capital stock or by members or by number of cows owned by each\r\nmember. It is necessary to indicate just how amendments to the\r\nconstitution may be made. Each member should know before the final vote\r\njust what changes are being proposed. Types of constitutions may be\r\nfound in the following references:\r\n\r\n\r\n  ELLIOTT, W. J., Creameries and cheese factories;\r\n  organization, building and equipment, Mont. Exp. Sta.

By the time the first\r\nimmigrants came to America, cheese-making was rather generally known in\r\nEurope, so that the early settlers brought with them and practiced\r\nestablished methods. The countries of Europe developed different kinds\r\nof cheese and have since become noted for such particular varieties, for\r\nexample: France, Camembert and Roquefort; Switzerland, Swiss cheese;\r\nEngland, Stilton and Cheddar; Germany, Limburger; Holland, Edam and\r\nGouda; Italy, Parmesan and its allies, also Gorgonzola cheese. The\r\nmanufacture of these various cheeses has been attempted in this country.\r\nBecause of the difference in climatic conditions and in some cases the\r\nuse of milk of sheep or goats, it was and still is difficult to\r\nmanufacture some of the European cheeses in America. Since the climatic\r\nconditions of this country and certain parts of England are somewhat\r\nsimilar, the manufacture of the cheeses of England predominated, and\r\nthere was also more information on their manufacture. These are probably\r\nthe reasons why the United States and Canada have become famous for\r\nCheddar cheese.\r\n\r\nThe first cheeses of the Cheddar group were made on the farms. The work\r\nwas usually performed by women, and the process was very simple. The\r\nmethods were crude, and the cheeses were made in a more or less\r\nhaphazard way. The milk of the evening was placed in a cheese tub in the\r\ndairy room and cooled to a temperature that would prevent souring. In\r\nmost cases the cream that had raised to the surface of the night's milk\r\nwas removed in the morning. This was considered an act of economy, for\r\nit was thought that in the process of manufacture it would all pass off\r\nin the whey and be lost. The morning's milk was then mixed with that of\r\nthe evening and warmed to the setting temperature by placing a portion\r\nin a tin pail and suspending it in a kettle of hot water. When hot, it\r\nwas emptied into the tub of cold milk. By transferring back and forth,\r\nthe setting temperature was finally reached. Few of these settlers owned\r\nthermometers. Consequently, cheese-makers were obliged to depend on the\r\nsense of feeling to determine temperature.\r\n\r\nOne of the serious difficulties of the early manufacture was the\r\nproduction of rennet of a uniform strength. After the addition of the\r\nrennet and as soon as the coagulated milk became firm enough, it was\r\nbroken into as small pieces as could be conveniently made, a wooden\r\nknife being used for the purpose. After standing ten minutes it was\r\nstirred by hand, breaking the pieces finer, and the temperature was\r\ngradually brought to 98° F., aiming as near blood heat as could be\r\njudged by the sense of feeling. It was kept at this temperature until\r\nthe moisture was out of the curd and it would squeak between the teeth.\r\nThe whey was drawn off and the curd stirred until dry, salted and put to\r\npress. All the curd of one day was made into a cheese. This resulted in\r\nsmall uneven-sized cheese. Since such cheeses were made from the milk of\r\nsingle dairies with all the surroundings clean, the flavor was usually\r\ngood but the texture was open and soft. The method of caring for the\r\ncheese and marketing was entirely different from that practiced at the\r\npresent time. All the cheeses made during the entire season were held\r\nuntil fall and marketed at one time. They were packed in casks four to\r\nsix in a package, one on top of the other. The earliest date when single\r\nboxed cheeses were on the market was 1841.\r\n\r\nBetween 1820 and 1840, a small export trade in cheese was started. As\r\nthis demand for cheese increased, particularly in England, it became\r\nnecessary to change the methods employed in manufacture. The farm dairy\r\ncheese was rather an open-textured sweet curd product. If not, it was\r\ndue more to accident than to any intention of the cheese-maker to\r\nimprove the quality. One of the early complaints from England was that\r\nthe cheeses were too small and uneven in size. The practice of making on\r\nthe farm continued until about 1851, when the factory system was\r\nstarted, although home manufactures continued after that time. Following\r\nare the reasons for the change from the farm to factory system: (1)\r\nEngland demanded larger cheese; (2) the farm product was not uniform;\r\n(3) the quality of the farm cheese did not suit the English trade; (4)\r\nfactories saved much labor on the farms; and (5) could secure higher\r\nprices.\r\n\r\n+297. The factory system.+--Where and by whom the first Cheddar cheese\r\nfactory in America was started is not definitely known. Jesse Williams\r\nof Oneida County, New York, is supposed by many to have been the first\r\nto build and operate under the factory system, in 1851. Cheese factories\r\nwere opened in Ohio and Wisconsin about 1860. In the period 1860 to\r\n1870, a large number of cheese factories were built in the various\r\nstates, especially New York, Ohio and Wisconsin.\r\n\r\n+298. Introduction of factory system in Canada.+--In 1863, Harvey\r\nFarrington of Herkimer, New York, was so impressed with the opportunity\r\nof developing the cheese factory system in Canada that he sold out his\r\nbusiness in New York and established the first Canadian cheese factory\r\nin the town of Norwich, Ontario. It was accepted at once by Canadian\r\nfarmers, and factory cheese-making increased rapidly. In 1866, a small\r\nquantity of cheese was exported and from that time the export trade of\r\nCanada has been large and growing. Ontario and Quebec are now the\r\nleading provinces in the production of cheese.\r\n\r\n+299. Introduction of cheddaring.+--The factories at first used the same\r\nprocess as the farms, namely the stirred-curd process. In 1867, Robert\r\nMcAdam introduced the English Cheddar system in a factory near Herkimer,\r\nNew York. This is the Cheddar system as known to-day. It produces the\r\ncloser bodied cheese demanded by the export trade. This introduction\r\nmade Herkimer County famous for its cheese.\r\n\r\n+300. Introduction of Swiss and Limburger.+--In 1870, factories for\r\nLimburger, Swiss and Brick cheese were started and have gradually\r\nincreased. In New York such plants are located around Boonville in\r\nOneida County, and Theresa, in Jefferson County. In Wisconsin, Swiss\r\ncheese-making was begun by a colony of Swiss who came to New Glarus,\r\nGreen County. It is now made in Green, Lafayette, Iowa, Grant, Dane and\r\nRock counties. Limburger and Brick are manufactured in Dodge, Fond du\r\nLac, Winnebago, Marathon, La Crosse, Buffalo, Trempealeau, Clark,\r\nWashington, Dunn, Barron and Lincoln counties. In the southeastern part\r\nof Ohio Swiss cheese is produced. Ohio and Wisconsin have manufactured\r\nmore of these cheeses, especially Swiss, than any other states. This is\r\nprobably due to the fact that the conditions are more nearly like those\r\nof Switzerland.\r\n\r\nWhen the cities in New York began to grow, an increased demand for\r\nmarket milk was felt. The result was that the dairy-men could not supply\r\nboth the cities and the cheese factories with milk. A large part of the\r\ncheese was being exported and most of it had always been partly skimmed.\r\nThe amount of skimming, therefore, was largely increased. Then other\r\nanimal fats were substituted for the milk-fat. This product was known as\r\n\"filled\" cheese. The delay in controlling the practice of making\r\nskimmed-milk and filled cheese ruined the export trade. In Canada laws\r\nprohibited the making of filled cheese and as a consequence Canadian\r\nCheddar cheese is still very popular in England. However, with the\r\ncontrol of skimmed-milk cheese-making and the elimination of filled\r\ncheese, the volume continued to grow and to find outlet in local\r\nconsumption. New York probably exported more cheese than any other\r\nstate. Wisconsin shipped cheese into other regions, especially the\r\nsouthern states in which no cheeses were made. Some Wisconsin cheeses\r\nwere shipped to the New York market from time to time, but in October,\r\n1913, the first quotations[133] were made in New York City for Wisconsin\r\nproducts.\r\n\r\n+301. Number and distribution of cheese factories.+--The following list\r\nand maps (Figs. 65, 66) compiled in 1914 by the United States Department\r\nof Agriculture Dairy Division, show the number of cheese factories in\r\nthe different states and their location:\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 65.--Map showing the distribution of cheese\r\nfactories in the principal cheese-producing states.]\r\n\r\n  Arizona         3\r\n  California     93\r\n  Colorado        8\r\n  Connecticut     2\r\n  Delaware        1\r\n  Illinois       50\r\n  Indiana        13\r\n  Iowa           25\r\n  Kansas          1\r\n  Maine           5\r\n  Michigan      196\r\n  Minnesota      74\r\n  Missouri        4\r\n  Montana         1\r\n  Nebraska        1\r\n  New Hampshire   2\r\n  New York      995\r\n  North Dakota    3\r\n  Ohio          111\r\n  Oklahoma        1\r\n  Oregon         42\r\n  Pennsylvania  106\r\n  South Dakota    1\r\n  Utah            8\r\n  Vermont        35\r\n  Virginia        3\r\n  Washington     15\r\n  West Virginia   1\r\n  Wisconsin    1720\r\n               ----\r\n               3520\r\n\r\n+302. Total production of cheese in the United States.+--The following\r\nfigures (Table XX) compiled by the United States Census show the total\r\nproduction of cheese and the amount made on farms and in factories in\r\nthe United States by ten-year periods:\r\n\r\n\r\n  TABLE XX\r\n\r\n  SHOWING THE TOTAL PRODUCTION OF CHEESE AND PART\r\n    MADE ON FARMS AND IN FACTORIES IN THE UNITED\r\n    STATES BY TEN-YEAR PERIODS\r\n\r\n  1849    Total          105,535,893 pounds\r\n\r\n  1859    Total          103,663,927 pounds\r\n\r\n  1869    Total          162,927,382 pounds\r\n\r\n  1879    Total          243,157,850 pounds\r\n\r\n  1889    On farms        18,726,818 pounds\r\n          In factories   238,035,065 pounds\r\n          Total          256,761,883 pounds\r\n\r\n  1899    On farms        16,372,330 pounds\r\n          In factories   281,972,324 pounds\r\n          Total          298,344,654 pounds\r\n\r\n  1909    On farms         9,405,864 pounds\r\n          In factories   311,126,317 pounds\r\n          Total          320,532,181 pounds\r\n\r\nComparing the figures of 1899 with those of 1909, it is seen that the\r\ntotal production of cheese in the United States increased 22,187,539\r\npounds, or an increase of 7.4 per cent in 1909 over 1899. During the\r\nsame years the amount made on the farms decreased 6,966,454 pounds, or a\r\ndecrease of 42.6 per cent, while the amount made in factories increased\r\n29,153,933 pounds or 10.3 per cent.\r\n\r\n+303. Rank of the leading cheese-producing states.+--The rank of the\r\nleading cheese states according to the number of factories in 1914 was:\r\nWisconsin 1720, New York 995, Michigan 196, Ohio 111, Pennsylvania 106.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 66.--Showing the cheese factories in the Pacific\r\ncoast states.]\r\n\r\nThe table on the opposite page (Table XXI) shows the amount of cheese\r\nproduced by the five states with the largest number of factories. This\r\ntable indicates that New York led in the production of cheese until some\r\ntime between 1899 and 1909. This is probably because, New York having so\r\nmany cities, the demand for market milk is so large that it is sold as\r\nsuch instead of being manufactured into cheese. There is about the same\r\nnumber of milch cows in New York and Wisconsin. However, Wisconsin is\r\ncredited with more cheese in 1909 than New York ever produced and this\r\noutput probably will increase, as there are considerable areas of\r\nundeveloped agricultural land in Wisconsin. It is also interesting to\r\nnote that Ohio is falling off in cheese production. This may be due to\r\nthe increased demand for market milk. On the other hand, production has\r\nincreased in Pennsylvania.\r\n\r\n  TABLE XXI\r\n\r\n  SHOWING THE AMOUNT OF CHEESE MADE IN FIVE LEADING STATES\r\n  BY TEN-YEAR PERIODS\r\n\r\n  ----------+----------+-----------+-----------+-----------+\r\n  STATE     |YEAR 1859 |YEAR 1869  |YEAR 1879  |YEAR 1889  |\r\n  ----------+----------+-----------+-----------+-----------+\r\n            |Amount in | Amount in |Amount in  |Amount in  |\r\n            |  pounds  |  pounds   |  pounds   |  pounds   |\r\n            |          |           |           |           |\r\n            |          |           |           |           |\r\n            |          |           |           |           |\r\n  Wisconsin | 1,104,300|  3,288,581| 19,535,324| 54,614,861|\r\n            |          |           |           |           |\r\n  New York  |48,548,289|100,776,012|129,163,714|124,086,524|\r\n            |          |           |           |           |\r\n  Michigan  | 1,641,897|  2,321,801|  3,953,585|  5,370,460|\r\n            |          |           |           |           |\r\n  Ohio      |21,618,893| 24,153,876| 32,531,683| 22,254,054|\r\n            |          |           |           |           |\r\n  Penn      | 2,508,556|  2,792,676|  8,966,737|  5,457,897|\r\n  ----------+----------+-----------+-----------+-----------+\r\n\r\n  ----------+-----------+-----------+-----------+\r\n  STATE     |YEAR 1899  |YEAR 1909  |YEAR 1914  |\r\n  ----------+-----------+-----------+-----------+\r\n            |Amount in  |Amount in  |Amount in  |\r\n            |  pounds   |  pounds   |pounds from|\r\n            |           |           |factories  |\r\n            |           |           |only       |\r\n            |           |           |           |\r\n  Wisconsin | 79,384,298|148,906,910|205,920,915|\r\n            |           |           |           |\r\n  New York  |130,010,584|105,584,947| 97,614,024|\r\n            |           |           |           |\r\n  Michigan  | 10,753,758| 13,673,336| 13,267,145|\r\n            |           |           |           |\r\n  Ohio      | 19,363,528| 12,473,834|  8,717,996|\r\n            |           |           |           |\r\n  Penn      | 11,124,610| 12,676,713| 14,808,573|\r\n  ----------+-----------+-----------+-----------+\r\n\r\n+304.

This is probably because immigrants\r\nhave demanded the cheeses of their native country which were not made in\r\nAmerica. The exports for the years 1915 and 1916 are interesting as they\r\nshow the effect of the war on the cheese industry, the imports being\r\ngradually decreased and the exports greatly increased.\r\n\r\n\r\n  TABLE XXII\r\n\r\n  SHOWING THE IMPORTS AND EXPORTS OF CHEESE BY THE\r\n  UNITED STATES FROM 1851-1916\r\n\r\n  ------+----------------------+--------------------------\r\n   YEAR |        IMPORTS       |          EXPORTS\r\n  ------+-----------+----------+-------------+------------\r\n        |  Amount   |          |   Amount    |\r\n        |    in     | Value in |     in      | Value in\r\n        |  pounds   | dollars  |   pounds    | dollars\r\n        |           |          |             |\r\n   1851 |   603,398 |  ----    |  10,361,189 |  ----\r\n   1852 |   514,337 |  ----    |   6,650,420 |  ----\r\n   1853 |   874,949 |  ----    |   3,763,932 |  ----\r\n   1854 |   969,417 |  ----    |   7,003,974 |  ----\r\n   1855 | 1,526,942 |  ----    |   4,846,568 |  ----\r\n   1856 | 1,384,272 |  ----    |   8,737,029 |  ----\r\n   1857 | 1,400,252 |  ----    |   6,453,072 |  ----\r\n   1858 | 1,589,066 |  ----    |   8,098,527 |  ----\r\n   1859 | 1,409,420 |  ----    |   7,103,323 |  ----\r\n   1860 | 1,401,161 |  ----    |  15,515,799 |  ----\r\n   1861 | 1,090,835 |  ----    |  32,361,428 |  ----\r\n   1862 |   594,822 |  ----    |  34,052,678 |  ----\r\n   1863 |   545,966 |  ----    |  42,045,054 |  ----\r\n   1864 |   836,127 |  ----    |  47,751,329 |  ----\r\n   1865 |   985,362 |  ----    |  53,154,318 |  ----\r\n   1866 |   ----    |  ----    |  36,411,985 |  ----\r\n   1867 | 1,738,657 |  ----    |  52,352,127 |  ----\r\n   1868 | 2,997,994 |  ----    |  51,097,203 |  ----\r\n   1869 |    ----   |  ----    |  39,960,367 |  ----\r\n   1870 |    ----   |  ----    |  57,296,327 |  ----\r\n   1871 |    ----   |  ----    |  63,698,867 |  ----\r\n   1872 |    ----   |  ----    |  66,204,025 |  ----\r\n   1873 |    ----   |  ----    |  80,366,540 |  ----\r\n   1874 |    ----   |  ----    |  90,611,077 |  ----\r\n   1875 |    ----   |  ----    | 101,010,853 |  ----\r\n   1876 |    ----   |  ----    |  97,676,264 |  ----\r\n   1877 |    ----   |  ----    | 107,364,666 |  ----\r\n   1878 |    ----   |  ----    | 123,783,736 |  ----\r\n   1879 |    ----   |  ----    | 141,654,474 |  ----\r\n   1880 |    ----   |  ----    | 127,553,907 |  ----\r\n   1881 |    ----   |  ----    | 147,995,614 |  ----\r\n   1882 |    ----   |  ----    | 127,989,782 |  ----\r\n   1883 |    ----   |  ----    |  99,220,467 |  ----\r\n   1884 | 6,243,014 |  ----    | 112,869,575 |  ----\r\n   1885 | 6,247,560 |  ----    | 111,992,990 |  ----\r\n   1886 | 6,309,124 |  ----    |  91,877,235 |\r\n   1887 | 6,592,192 |  ----    |  81,255,994 |\r\n   1888 | 8,750,185 |  ----    |  88,008,458 |\r\n   1889 | 8,207,026 |  ----    |  84,999,828 |\r\n   1890 | 9,263,573 |  ----    |  95,376,053 |\r\n   1891 | 8,863,640 |  ----    |  82,133,876 |\r\n   1892 | 8,305,288 |  ----    |  82,100,221 |\r\n   1893 |10,195,924 |  ----    |  81,350,923 |\r\n   1894 | 8,742,851 |  ----    |  73,852,134 |\r\n   1895 |10,276,293 |  ----    |  60,448,421 |\r\n   1896 |10,728,397 |  ----    |  36,777,291 |\r\n   1897 |12,319,122 |  ----    |  50,944,617 |\r\n   1898 |10,012,188 |  ----    |  53,167,280 |\r\n   1899 |11,826,175 |  ----    |  38,198,753 |\r\n   1900 |13,455,990 |  ----    |  48,419,353 |\r\n   1901 |15,329,099 |  ----    |  39,813,517 |\r\n   1902 |17,067,714 |$2,551,366|  27,203,184 |$2,745,597\r\n   1903 |20,671,384 | 3,183,224|  18,987,178 | 2,250,229\r\n   1904 |22,707,103 | 3,284,811|  23,335,172 | 2,452,239\r\n   1905 |23,095,705 | 3,379,600|  10,134,424 | 1,084,044\r\n   1906 |27,286,866 | 4,303,830|  16,562,451 | 1,940,620\r\n   1907 |33,848,766 | 5,704,012|  17,285,230 | 2,012,626\r\n   1908 |32,530,830 | 5,586,706|   8,439,031 | 1,092,053\r\n   1909 |35,548,143 | 5,866,154|   6,822,842 |   857,091\r\n   1910 |40,817,524 | 7,053,570|   2,846,709 |   441,017\r\n   1911 |45,568,797 | 7,920,244|  10,366,605 | 1,288,279\r\n   1912 |46,542,007 | 8,807,249|   6,337,559 |   898,035\r\n   1913 |49,387,944 | 9,185,184|   2,599,058 |   441,186\r\n   1914 |63,784,313 |11,010,693|   2,427,577 |   414,124\r\n   1915 |50,138,520 | 9,370,048|  55,362,917 | 8,463,174\r\n   1916 |30,087,999 | 7,058,420|  44,394,301 | 7,430,089\r\n  ------+-----------+----------+-------------+------------\r\n\r\nThe graph (Fig. 67) represents the total production and the exports and\r\nimports of cheese into the United States.\r\n\r\n+305.

The figures in Table XXIV show\r\nthe number of cheese factories, the amount of milk received and the\r\ntotal production in Canada.\r\n\r\nTable XXIV indicates that the number of cheese factories has decreased\r\nbut that the production has increased. Because of the scarcity of\r\nfigures, conclusions would not be accurate.\r\n\r\nThe figures in Table XXV of the exports and imports show that the\r\nexports gradually decreased and the imports increased. If the production\r\nhas increased, as shown in Table XXIV, more cheese must be consumed by\r\nthe Canadians. The effect of the war is probably seen in the year 1916,\r\nwhen the imports are decreased and the exports increased.\r\n\r\n\r\n  TABLE XXIV\r\n\r\n  SHOWING THE NUMBER OF CHEESE FACTORIES, AMOUNT OF\r\n  MILK RECEIVED AND THE FACTORY PRODUCTION OF\r\n  CHEESE\r\n\r\n  -------+------------+---------------+---------------\r\n         | NUMBER OF  |   POUNDS OF   |  FACTORY\r\n   YEAR  | CHEESE     |   MILK        | PRODUCTION\r\n         | FACTORIES  |   DELIVERED   | OF CHEESE\r\n  -------+------------+---------------+---------------\r\n   1900  |   ----     |    ----       | 220,833,269\r\n         |            |               |\r\n   1907  |   ----     |    ----       | 204,788,583\r\n         |            |               |\r\n   1910  |   2291     |    ----       | 199,904,205\r\n         |            |               |\r\n   1915  |   1871     | 1,501,946,221 | 183,887,837\r\n         |            |               |\r\n   1916  |   1813     | 1,503,997,215 | 192,968,597\r\n  -------+------------+---------------+---------------\r\n\r\n\r\n  TABLE XXV\r\n\r\n  SHOWING THE AMOUNT AND VALUE OF CANADIAN EXPORTS AND\r\n  IMPORTS OF CHEESE\r\n\r\n  ------+--------------------------+----------------------\r\n   Year |          Exports         |        Imports\r\n  ------+-------------+------------+-----------+----------\r\n        | Amount in   | Value in   | Amount in | Value in\r\n        |  pounds     | dollars    |  pounds   | dollars\r\n  ------+-------------+------------+-----------+----------\r\n   1880 |  40,368,000 | $3,893,000 |           |\r\n        |             |            |           |\r\n   1890 |  94,260,000 |  9,372,212 |           |\r\n        |             |            |           |\r\n   1900 | 185,984,000 | 19,856,324 |           |\r\n        |             |            |           |\r\n   1910 | 180,859,000 | 21,607,692 |   683,778 |  ----\r\n        |             |            |           |\r\n   1911 | 181,895,000 | 20,739,507 |   866,653 |  ----\r\n        |             |            |           |\r\n   1912 | 163,450,000 | 20,888,818 |   919,189 |  ----\r\n        |             |            |           |\r\n   1913 | 155,216,000 | 20,697,000 | 1,495,758 |  ----\r\n        |             |            |           |\r\n   1914 | 144,478,000 | 18,866,000 | 1,512,108 |  ----\r\n        |             |            |           |\r\n   1915 | 137,601,000 | 19,213,000 | 1,162,456 |  ----\r\n        |             |            |           |\r\n   1916 | 168,961,000 |   ----     |   971,821 |  ----\r\n  ------+-------------+------------+-----------+----------\r\n\r\nIf the total population of the United States is figured at 100 million\r\nand the difference between the exports and imports found and added to\r\nthe total production, it shows that the average person must consume\r\nabout three and one-half pounds of cheese in a year.\r\n\r\nIn the past few years there has been considerable demand for more of the\r\nforeign cheeses, such as Camembert and Roquefort.\r\n\r\n+307. Introduction of cheese-making into new regions.+--The manufacture\r\nof Cheddar cheese is being encouraged in new regions, in the Alleghany\r\nMountains, in Virginia, West Virginia, North Carolina, Tennessee and in\r\nthe western states. There has also sprung up a considerable demand for\r\nthe lactic acid group of cheeses, especially Neufchâtel and Cottage, so\r\nthat while the cheese industry may decline in certain sections, the\r\ntotal production will probably increase. In the proper locations or\r\nsections, the cheese industry has a very bright future. The development\r\nof the skimmed-milk cheeses will undoubtedly be given considerable\r\nattention in the next few years.\r\n\r\n\r\nREFERENCES\r\n\r\n  N. Y. Dept. Agr.

This includes the testing of the whole milk, whey\r\nand cheese for fat, the milk for casein, and the cheese for moisture. In\r\nfactories in which the milk is bought on the fat basis, it is necessary\r\nto test each patron's milk for fat. If there is a cheese-moisture law in\r\nthe state, it is necessary to test for moisture. The whey should be\r\ntested to learn the loss of fat in the manufacturing process and to\r\nascertain whether the losses have been reduced to the minimum.\r\n\r\n+308. The fat test.+--The test commonly used to determine the fat in\r\nmilk is known as the Babcock. The principle of this test is as follows:\r\nFat exists in the form of very small globules. Because the fat globules\r\nare lighter than the other milk constituents, under the influence of the\r\nforce of gravity most of them rise to the surface. There, mixed with the\r\nother milk substances, these globules form a layer of cream. Babcock\r\nfound that by adding to the milk sulfuric acid of proper strength and\r\ntemperature, the casein, the milk-sugar and the albumin are decomposed\r\nand the sticky quality of the milk is destroyed. The acid does not\r\ndecompose the fat but leaves it free to come to the surface of the\r\nmixture. Under centrifugal force, this fat is quickly brought to the\r\nsurface. By using a known quantity of milk and having a scale graduated\r\nin percentage of the amount of milk, the percentage of fat can be\r\ndetermined. Fig. 69 shows the necessary equipment.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 69.--Apparatus necessary to test milk and whey for\r\nfat and total solids.]\r\n\r\nThere are three kinds of bottles employed in making the test, one with a\r\nvery large neck which is used when testing materials high in fat-content\r\nsuch as cream, butter and cheese. This is generally called a cream-test\r\nbottle. It is graduated from 0 to 50 per cent. When testing materials\r\nwith a small amount of fat such as whey, skim-milk and buttermilk, a\r\ntest bottle with two necks is used, one with a small bore for the fat\r\nand the other neck with a larger bore to add the milk, acid, water. It\r\nis graduated from 0 to 0.5 of 1 per cent. There is a third bottle\r\nbetween the other two to test whole milk. This is known as a whole-milk\r\nbottle. It is graduated from 0 to 8 per cent. All of the glassware\r\nshould comply with the laws.\r\n\r\n+309. Sampling the milk.+--One of the most important parts of testing is\r\nto obtain a fair sample of the milk. The milk to be tested may be in a\r\nvat or in a farmer's can or a composite sample jar. If the milk is\r\nbought on the fat basis, that of each patron is not tested daily, but a\r\nsmall quantity, about half an ounce, is taken each day and placed in a\r\njar; this is known as a composite sample. It is the usual practice to\r\nnumber the patrons and have a sample bottle for each patron with his\r\nnumber on it. Some substance must be added to preserve the milk and to\r\nkeep it from souring or coagulating. It is difficult to secure a fair\r\nsample of sour milk. A wide-mouthed jar is preferred for keeping milk\r\nsamples. This must be kept closed to prevent evaporation. Each day when\r\nmilk is added to the composite sample, the bottles should be shaken to\r\nprevent the cream drying. Composite samples are tested at least twice a\r\nmonth. The milk may be mixed to obtain a fair sample, by stirring in the\r\nvat or by pouring from one bottle to another. Vigorous shaking should be\r\navoided as this is likely to cause churning. One should see that all the\r\ncream is removed from the sides of the sample bottle and that it is\r\nevenly distributed through the milk. The sample of milk is now measured\r\nout with the pipette. This is graduated to deliver 18 grams of milk, and\r\nholds 17.6 c.c. Hold the pipette between the thumb and second finger of\r\nthe right hand with the tip below the surface of the milk, draw the milk\r\nby suction with the lips until it is filled well above the graduation.\r\nQuickly place the forefinger over the opening and at right angles to the\r\npipette. By gently and carefully raising the forefinger, allow the milk\r\nto run down until the surface is exactly level with the graduation. To\r\nobtain an accurate reading, the pipette should be on a level with the\r\neye. Then with the left hand, hold the milk test bottle in a slanting\r\nposition and place the tip of the pipette into it about one-third of an\r\ninch and at a slight angle. Now let the milk slowly flow down the side\r\nof the neck of the bottle, making certain that none is blown out by the\r\nescaping air. When all has run out of the pipette, blow out the drop\r\nwhich remains in the tip. Then measure out another sample in the same\r\nway, as the test should be made in duplicate.\r\n\r\n+310. Adding the acid.+--The sulfuric acid should have a specific\r\ngravity between 1.82 and 1.83. It should be kept in glass-stoppered\r\nbottles or carboys to prevent the absorption of moisture from the air,\r\nwhich will reduce its strength. Acid that is too strong might burn the\r\nfat. The acid is a strong poison and will burn if it comes in contact\r\nwith the flesh or the clothing. In such case, it should be removed by\r\nwashing with plenty of water. An alkaline substance such as ammonia or\r\nbicarbonate of soda should be applied to remove any acid not washed\r\naway.\r\n\r\nThe acid measure holds 17.5 c.c. and it should be filled to the\r\ngraduation. Then this acid should be added to the test bottle. The\r\nbottle should be held at an angle and slowly rotated so that the acid\r\nwill rinse down any milk remaining in the neck of the bottle.\r\nImmediately mix the acid and milk by whirling the body of the bottle in\r\na circle five or six inches in diameter. The mixture should not be\r\nallowed to go into the neck of the bottle while mixing. Continue shaking\r\nfor about a minute after all the curd has disappeared. One should avoid\r\npointing the neck of the bottle toward any person in the mixing\r\noperation. The acid unites with all the milk substances except the fat\r\nand generates much heat.\r\n\r\n+311. Centrifuging.+--There are two machines in common use for\r\ncentrifuging, one that runs by mechanical power and the other smaller\r\nand runs by hand. If the machine and atmosphere are very cold, the\r\napparatus can be warmed by placing hot water in it. This is not\r\nnecessary in a steam machine. In a factory where there are a number of\r\nsamples to test, a power machine is usually employed. In this machine\r\nthere are pockets or cups in which to set the test bottles. The machine\r\nor disk must be balanced by placing bottles in opposite pockets. These\r\npockets are hinged so that when standing still the bottle is in an\r\nupright position and when the centrifuge is running, it is in a\r\nhorizontal position. The machine should then be covered and started\r\nrunning. It should be run at the speed indicated. After five minutes,\r\nstop the machine and fill the bottles with boiling water up to the neck.\r\nThis can be done without taking the bottles out of the machine. A\r\npipette or slender-spouted vessel may be used to add the water. Whirl\r\nthe bottles two minutes, then add more boiling water to bring the fat\r\ncolumn into the graduated part of the neck of the bottle. Then whirl one\r\nminute. The test should be read at once or the bottles kept at a\r\ntemperature of 130° to 140° F. until ready to read.\r\n\r\n+312. Reading the test.+--To read the test, subtract the reading at the\r\nbottom of the fat column from that at the highest point. The curved\r\nmeniscus which always forms at the top of the fat column should be\r\nincluded in the reading. Duplicate samples should not vary more than O.2\r\nof 1 per cent. Standard Babcock test bottles and pipettes should always\r\nbe used. In some states the agricultural experiment stations examine all\r\nglassware and mark it to make certain that it conforms to the\r\nrequirements of the state law. In New York, glassware found to be\r\ncorrect is branded \"S. B.,\" which means State Brand. In some states a\r\nperson must have a license to test milk or cream, when it is paid for on\r\nthe fat test. Such a person must pass an examination to show that he\r\nunderstands the test before a license, will be granted. The license may\r\nbe revoked if the work is not honestly performed.\r\n\r\n+313. Testing whey for fat.+--Because of the small amount of fat in\r\nwhey, it is difficult to obtain a representative sample. The best way,\r\nif the entire amount cannot be placed in a vat and stirred, is to catch\r\na little of the whey at intervals as it is being drawn from the vat. The\r\nsample to be tested is measured with the pipette the same as the milk\r\nand placed in the skimmed-milk test bottle. The same acid is used to\r\ntest whey as to test milk but because there are not so many solids to\r\ndestroy, not so much is used. If as much acid is used with whey as with\r\nmilk, it will burn the fat and so interfere with the reading of the\r\ntest. Just enough acid is added to destroy the milk substances except\r\nthe fat, or enough to turn the contents of the test bottle dark brown.\r\nThis usually requires filling the acid measure one-quarter of an inch\r\nunder the graduation. The remainder of the test is the same as for whole\r\nmilk.\r\n\r\n+314. Testing cheese for fat.+--The sample of cheese to test for fat is\r\nobtained by removing the sample with a cheese-trier. This sample is\r\ncalled a \"plug.\" Different plugs from the same cheese will test various\r\npercentages of fat so that it is difficult to secure a representative\r\nsample. The usual practice is to take three plugs, one near the center,\r\nanother near the outside and the third between the first two. The plugs\r\nshould be put into glass-stoppered bottles to prevent the evaporation of\r\nmoisture. These plugs are then chopped up very fine. It is of course\r\nimpossible to measure the cheese as with milk and whey, but it is\r\nweighed (Fig. 70). If the cheese is soft it can be stirred with a\r\nspatula until well mixed. A soft cheese usually sticks to the neck of\r\nthe test bottle. After being weighed, it can be dissolved in a little\r\nsodium hydroxide and poured into the bottle. Different amounts may be\r\nused, commonly 4½ or 6 grams, but 6 grams is to be preferred. This is\r\nplaced in the Babcock cream bottle since there will usually be more fat\r\nthan can be read in a milk bottle. After the material has been placed in\r\nthe test bottle, about two-thirds of an acid-measure of warm water is\r\nadded to assist in dissolving the cheese.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 70.--Apparatus necessary to test cheese for fat.]\r\n\r\nThe acid is added the same as with the milk. If all the cheese particles\r\nare not destroyed, and therefore do not disappear, a little more acid\r\nwill complete the solution. Centrifuging is performed as with the milk.\r\n\r\n+315. Reading the test.+--In a cream-test bottle the neck is so much\r\nwider that there is a much larger meniscus. In order to obtain an\r\naccurate result, the meniscus should be removed. This is done by\r\ncarefully adding a substance called glymol, which is a mineral oil\r\ncolored red. Usually about one-quarter of an inch of glymol is added to\r\nthe fat column. This should not mix with the fat. The bottles should be\r\nplaced in a hot water bath 135° to 140° F. for four minutes before\r\nreading. The temperature at reading should be 135° to 140° F. The\r\nreading is then taken from the bottom of the fat column to the line\r\nbetween this and the glymol. The bottle is graduated for 18 grams of\r\nmaterial, but as only a part of 18 grams of cheese was used for the\r\ntest, the reading should be multiplied by the part of 18 grams used. For\r\nexample, suppose 6 grams of cheese were used and the test read 12 per\r\ncent fat. Since 6 is one third of 18, the actual percentage of fat is 3\r\ntimes 12, or 36 per cent.\r\n\r\n+316. The Hart[134] casein test+ was devised to determine the percentage\r\nof casein in milk. A special test bottle and centrifuge are necessary.\r\nThe method of making the test is as follows: Place 2 c.c. of chloroform\r\nin the casein test tube, add 20 c.c. of a 0.25 of 1 per cent solution of\r\nacetic acid at a temperature of 65° to 75° F. This solution of acetic\r\nacid is made by diluting 10 c.c. of glacial acetic acid with 100 c.c. of\r\nwater, then dilute 25 c.c. of this solution to 1000 c.c. with water; 5\r\nc.c. of milk at a temperature of 65° to 75° F. is then run into the\r\nbottle. The bottle is then covered with the thumb and inverted and the\r\nmixture shaken vigorously for exactly twenty seconds. It is then\r\ncentrifuged within twenty minutes at a speed of 2000 revolutions a\r\nminute. The bottle should stand ten minutes before reading the\r\npercentage of casein. There are other tests for casein but they are very\r\ncomplicated.\r\n\r\n+317. Solids in the milk.+--Because not only the fat but all the solids\r\nare utilized in cheese-making, it is important to know the amount of the\r\nsolids in the milk. This is ascertained by determining the specific\r\ngravity of the milk and knowing the fat-content; the solids not fat can\r\nthen be calculated.\r\n\r\n+318. The lactometer.+--The specific gravity of liquids is measured by\r\nan instrument called a hydrometer. Its use is based on the fact that\r\nwhen a solid body floats in a liquid, it displaces a volume of liquid\r\nequal in weight to its own. Hydrometers are in many cases so made that\r\nthe specific gravity can be read at the point where the scale is even\r\nwith the upper surface of the liquid. A hydrometer that is especially\r\nadapted to milk is called a lactometer. There are two lactometers in\r\ncommon use, the Quevenne and the Board of Health.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 71.--A Quevenne lactometer.]\r\n\r\n_The Quevenne lactometer._--This is a long slender hollow piece of glass\r\nweighted at the bottom to make it float in the milk in an upright\r\nposition (Fig. 71). The upper end is slender and contains the scale.\r\nThis scale is graduated from 15 at the top to 40 at the bottom. Each\r\nreading on the scale corresponds to the point marked specific gravity on\r\na hydrometer, except that the figures are not complete. For example, 15\r\non the Quevenne scale means a specific gravity of 1.015; a reading of\r\n30 on the Quevenne scale means a specific gravity of 1.030, and so on.\r\nThe Quevenne lactometer is graduated to give correct results at a\r\ntemperature of 60° F. The milk should be at this temperature. If the\r\ntemperature is below or above this, a correction must be made to the\r\nreading. The temperature should not be more than 10 degrees above or\r\nbelow 60° F. The correction for each degree in variation of temperature\r\ncan be made by adding 0.1 or subtracting 0.1 from the lactometer\r\nreading, as the case may be. If the temperature is above 60° F., the\r\ncorrection is added to the lactometer and if it is below 60° F., the\r\ncorrection is subtracted from the lactometer reading. The reading should\r\nbe taken when the lactometer is floating free in the milk. The scale is\r\nread exactly at the surface of the milk. The better lactometers have a\r\nthermometer with the scale just above or opposite the lactometer scale.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 72.--A Board of Health lactometer.]\r\n\r\n_The Board of Health lactometer._--This is very similar to the Quevenne\r\nlactometer except that the scale is graduated from 0 to 120 (Fig. 72).\r\nThe point on the scale of the lactometer that floats at the surface in\r\nwater is represented by 0, and 100 represents the specific gravity of\r\n1.029. On the Board of Health lactometer, the 100 degrees or divisions\r\nfrom 0 to 100 equal 29 divisions on the Quevenne. Therefore, one\r\ndivision on the Board of Health equals 0.29 of a division on the\r\nQuevenne. To convert Board of Health reading to Quevenne, multiply by\r\n0.29 and to convert Quevenne to Board of Health, divide by 0.29. The\r\ncorrection for temperatures above or below 60° F. is made the same as\r\nwith the Quevenne, except 0.3 is added or subtracted from the reading\r\ninstead of 0.1 as with the Quevenne.\r\n\r\n+319. Calculating the solids not fat in the milk.+--When the lactometer\r\nreading and fat-content of the milk are known, there are several\r\nformulas for calculating the solids not fat. In the following formulas,\r\nL equals Quevenne lactometer reading at 60° F., and F equals the\r\npercentage of fat in the milk:\r\n\r\n  L + 0.7 F\r\n  --------- = S.N.F\r\n     3.8\r\n\r\n  L + F\r\n  ----- = S.N.F.\r\n    4\r\n\r\n  L\r\n  - + 0.2 F + 0.14 = S.N.F.\r\n  4\r\n\r\n+320. Testing cheese for moisture.+[135]--There are two methods of\r\ntesting cheese for moisture. The following is a simple test devised by\r\nH. C. Troy:\r\n\r\nThe ordinary butter moisture test, in which a metal cup is heated over a\r\nflame, cannot be used for determining the percentage of water in cheese\r\nbecause the high temperature developed in operating that test drives\r\nfrom he cheese other substances with the water. Also, particles are lost\r\nby spattering when the cheese is heated with any degree of rapidity in\r\nthe shallow butter-moisture cups. To overcome these difficulties, the\r\nnew method here described has been developed for the purpose of\r\ndetermining the percentage of moisture in cheese. The apparatus consists\r\nof:\r\n\r\n  1 double-walled copper drying cup\r\n  1 centigrade thermometer registering to 200°\r\n  1 alcohol lamp\r\n  1 tripod\r\n  1 special flask\r\n  1 scales sensitive to 0.01 gram\r\n  1 set of weights, 0.01 to 100 grams\r\n\r\nThe body of the copper drying cup may be made in two parts. One of the\r\nparts is a jacket that forms the outer wall of the apparatus. It has a\r\nflat bottom 4½ inches in diameter, and the perpendicular wall is\r\n4½ inches in height. The inner part of the cup must have a flat\r\nbottom 2¾ inches in diameter and a side wall 3¾ inches high. A\r\nflange attached to the upper rim of the inner part extends out at right\r\nangles to the cup wall and forms a cover for the space between the walls\r\nwhen the two parts are put together. The flange is bent down around its\r\nouter edge to make it fit snugly over the upper rim of the outer jacket.\r\nIt thus holds the inner cup securely in place, leaving a space about ¾\r\ninch wide for oil between the walls and bottoms, and permits the\r\napparatus to be taken apart readily. A circular opening about ½ inch\r\nin diameter is made through the flange to permit the insertion of a\r\nthermometer for taking the temperature of the oil or the melted fat\r\nwhich is used in the space between the walls. Lard or tallow serves best\r\nfor use in this space; a readily inflammable oil should not be employed.\r\nThe thermometer may be permanently held in place by passing it snugly\r\nthrough a hole bored in a cork, the cork being then fitted into the\r\nhole through the flange. A flat metal cover is placed on the cup when\r\nmaking a test. This cover has a hole through the center just large\r\nenough to permit the neck of the drying flask to extend up through it.\r\nThe cover assists in keeping the body of the flask at a constant\r\ntemperature by preventing the entrance of cold air currents. The\r\nthermometer should register changes in temperature between zero and 200°\r\nC. The alcohol lamp should yield a flame about ¼ inch in diameter and\r\n¾ inch high. The tripod should be about 6 inches high and of proper\r\ndiameter at the top to support the oil bath.\r\n\r\nAn ordinary flat-bottom glass Erlenmeyer flask, of such a diameter as to\r\nfit neatly into the oil-bath cup, may be used to hold the cheese during\r\nthe drying operation; but a special glass flask serves better. It is\r\nmade with a flat bottom 2½ inches in diameter, which will fit into\r\nthe cup of the drying apparatus. The side walls of this flask should be\r\nperpendicular for about 1 inch, when they should begin to slope in\r\ntoward the base of the neck, which should be located about 2 inches\r\nabove the bottom. The neck of the flask should be 1 inch in diameter,\r\nwith perpendicular walls, and its length should give the flask a total\r\nheight of 4¾ inches. When the apparatus (Fig. 73) is put together for\r\nthe first time, the melted fat or oil may be placed in the outer jacket\r\nand the inner cup may then be fitted into position, or the parts may be\r\nput together first and the oil then poured into the space between the\r\ncup walls through the opening where the thermometer is to be placed. The\r\noil should fill the space to within an inch of the top. The cork\r\nthrough which the thermometer has been passed is then fitted into the\r\nopening. The thermometer bulb should be placed in the oil about half an\r\ninch above the bottom of the outer jacket. The apparatus is then placed\r\non the tripod over the alcohol lamp. A flame ½ inch in diameter and\r\n¾ inch high will give sufficient heat to hold the bath at the proper\r\ntemperature. The temperature may be regulated by raising or lowering the\r\nlamp or by changing the size of the flame by adjusting the wick.\r\nHundreds of tests may be run without taking the apparatus apart or\r\nchanging the oil. The copper drying cup can be made by any tinsmith. The\r\nother parts may be ordered through any dairy or chemical supply company.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 73.--Apparatus necessary to test cheese for\r\nmoisture.]\r\n\r\nIn operating the test, the alcohol lamp is first lighted, so that the\r\noil bath may be warming while the test sample is under preparation. A\r\nrepresentative sample of the cheese, which may be taken with a\r\ncheese-trier and held in a glass-stoppered sample jar, is then cut into\r\nparticles about the size of kernels of wheat without removing it from\r\nthe jar. This may be accomplished with an ordinary table knife that has\r\nhad the end squared and sharpened. The clean dry flask is then\r\naccurately balanced on the scales and a 5-gram weight is placed in the\r\nopposite scale pan. Particles of cheese from the prepared sample are put\r\ninto the flask until the scales comes to an exact balance. Great care\r\nshould be taken to avoid loss of moisture from the cheese in the\r\npreparation of the sample.\r\n\r\nWith the thermometer in the oil bath registering between 140° and 145°\r\nC. (or between 284° and 293° F.), the flask is placed in the cup of the\r\noil bath and the flat disk-shaped cover is adjusted over the apparatus.\r\nThe flask should remain in the bath for fifty minutes, the temperature\r\nbeing kept between 140° and 145° C. all the time. The flask is then\r\nremoved, covered and allowed to cool to room temperature in a dry place.\r\nIt is then weighed, and the quotient obtained by dividing the loss in\r\nweight by the original weight, multiplied by 100, gives the percentage\r\nof water in the cheese. The following shows the method of computation:\r\n\r\nProblem: Five grams of cheese was heated until the water contained in it\r\nwas evaporated. The remaining substance weighed 3.15 grams. What\r\npercentage of water did the cheese contain?\r\n\r\n  Answer: 5.00 - 3.15 = 1.85\r\n          1.85 ÷ 5    = 0.37\r\n          0.37 × 100  = 37 (percentage of water in cheese)\r\n\r\nA butter-moisture scales with an extra 5-gram weight may be used for\r\nweighing out the 5 grams of cheese. If the scales indicates the amount\r\nof moisture in 10 grams of butter by percentage graduations on its beam\r\nor by percentage weights, then it will be necessary to multiply by 2 the\r\npercentage indicated by such scales or percentage weights when only 5\r\ngrams of cheese is used.\r\n\r\nThe moisture may be determined by weighing out a small sample of cheese\r\nand drying it in an oven and calling the loss moisture. Many such ovens\r\nhave been devised.\r\n\r\nNew York and Wisconsin have laws limiting the amount of water which may\r\nbe incorporated in Cheddar cheese. New York places the limit at 39 per\r\ncent and Wisconsin at 40 per cent. If the moisture-content is above\r\nthis, the cheese must be branded adulterated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX\r\n\r\n_MARKETING_\r\n\r\n\r\nMarketing is related to cheese in two ways: First, the purchase of the\r\nraw material, the milk; and secondly the sale of the finished product,\r\nthe cheese.\r\n\r\n+321. Buying milk.+--The method of paying for the milk differs in the\r\nvarious cheese sections and factories. At some factories a stated price\r\nis paid for the milk or the fat. This is usually in terms of 100 pounds\r\nof milk or for each pound of fat. This is the practice with concerns\r\npossessing large capital. Other factories make the milk into cheese and\r\nafter each sale, the expenses necessary for operating the factory are\r\ndeducted and the remainder of the money divided among the patrons. This\r\nmoney is divided either on the basis of the number of pounds of milk or\r\nof fat delivered. The question arises as to which is the better method\r\nto buy milk for cheese-making, or the fairest way to divide the money\r\nreceived from a sale of cheese.\r\n\r\n+322. Cheese yield basis of buying milk.+--Let us suppose that at a\r\ncheese factory there were five patrons: (A) delivered 100 pounds of milk\r\ntesting 3 per cent fat; (B) 100 pounds of milk testing 3.5 per cent fat;\r\n(C) 100 pounds of milk testing 4.0 per cent fat; (D) 100 pounds of milk\r\ntesting 4.5 per cent fat; and (E) 100 pounds of milk testing 5.0 per\r\ncent fat. Table XXVI shows the actual number of pounds of cheese\r\ncontaining 37 per cent moisture which 100 pounds of milk containing\r\ndifferent percentages of fat will produce. The cheese sold net for 20\r\ncents a pound.\r\n\r\n  TABLE XXVI\r\n\r\n  SHOWING PAYMENTS FOR MILK BASED ON THE ACTUAL YIELD\r\n  OF CHEESE\r\n\r\n  =====================================================================\r\n  PATRON |  POUNDS   | PER CENT  | YIELD OF CHEESE | PRICE A |  AMOUNT\r\n         |  OF MILK  | OF FAT IN |   CONTAINING    |  POUND  | DUE EACH\r\n         | DELIVERED |   MILK    |  37% MOISTURE   |         |  PATRON\r\n  -------+-----------+-----------+-----------------+---------+---------\r\n     A   |    100    |    3.0    |      8.30       |  $.20   |  $1.66\r\n     B   |    100    |    3.5    |      9.45       |   .20   |   1.89\r\n     C   |    100    |    4.0    |     10.60       |   .20   |   2.12\r\n     D   |    100    |    4.5    |     11.74       |   .20   |   2.348\r\n     E   |    100    |    5.0    |     12.90       |   .20   |   2.58\r\n  -------+-----------+-----------+-----------------+---------+---------\r\n   Total |    500    |   20      |     52.99       |   .20   |  10.598\r\n  =====================================================================\r\n\r\nThis table shows the amount of money each patron should receive if the\r\nmoney were divided on the basis of the actual yield of cheese.\r\n\r\n+323. Fat basis for payment of milk.+--Let us suppose that the same five\r\npatrons delivered the same quantity of milk testing the same percentages\r\nof fat and that the cheese sold for the same price. A total of 20 pounds\r\nof fat was delivered and the cheese sold for $10.598; by dividing this\r\namount by the pounds of fat delivered, the price or value of one pound\r\nof fat is found to be $.5299. Multiplying the pounds of fat each patron\r\ndelivered by the price a pound would give the amount of money due each\r\npatron.\r\n\r\n\r\n  TABLE XXVII\r\n\r\n  SHOWING PAYMENTS FOR MILK BASED ON FAT-CONTENT OF\r\n  MILK\r\n\r\n  ===================================================================\r\n         |  POUNDS   | PER CENT  | POUNDS OF | VALUE OF |\r\n  PATRON |  OF MILK  | OF FAT IN |    FAT    | POUND OF | AMOUNT DUE\r\n         | DELIVERED |   MILK    | DELIVERED |    FAT   | EACH PATRON\r\n  -------+-----------+-----------+-----------+----------+------------\r\n     A   |   100     |    3.0    |    3.0    |  $.5299  |  $1.58\r\n     B   |   100     |    3.5    |    3.5    |   .5299  |   1.85\r\n     C   |   100     |    4.0    |    4.0    |   .5299  |   2.12\r\n     D   |   100     |    4.5    |    4.5    |   .5299  |   2.38\r\n     E   |   100     |    5.0    |    5.0    |   .5299  |   2.65\r\n  ===================================================================\r\n\r\n+324. Weight basis or pooling method for payment of milk.+--By this\r\nsystem, each patron would receive an equal price for 100 pounds of milk.\r\nIf the same supposition is taken as before, there would be 500 pounds of\r\nmilk delivered and the cheese sold for $10.59; each 100 pounds of milk\r\nwould be worth $2.12. As each patron delivered an equal weight of milk,\r\neach would receive an equal amount of money, or $2.12.\r\n\r\n+325. Fat-plus-two method for payment of milk.+--Some workers have\r\nthought that by adding two to the fat test, the division of money would\r\nbe more nearly the true cheese-producing value of the milk. The amount\r\ndue each patron is figured as in the fat basis, except that two is added\r\nto the fat test and this is used as the basis of division. If the same\r\nsuppositions were used as before, each patron would receive the amount\r\nshown in Table XXVIII.\r\n\r\n+326. Comparison of methods.+--The best way to judge the different\r\nmethods of paying for milk is to compare them with the true value based\r\non the actual cheese yield as shown in Table XXIX.\r\n\r\n\r\n  TABLE XXVIII\r\n\r\n  SHOWING PAYMENTS FOR MILK BY FAT-PLUS-TWO METHODS\r\n\r\n  ===========================================================================\r\n  PATRON |  POUNDS   | PER CENT  | FAT PLUS |  POUNDS   | VALUE OF |  AMOUNT\r\n         | OF MILK   | OF FAT IN |   TWO    |  OF FAT   | POUND OF | DUE EACH\r\n         | DELIVERED |   MILK    |          | DELIVERED |    FAT   |  PATRON\r\n  -------+-----------+-----------+----------+-----------+----------+---------\r\n     A   |   100     |    3.0    |   5.0    |    5.0    |  $.353   |  $1.76\r\n     B   |   100     |    3.5    |   5.5    |    5.5    |   .353   |   1.94\r\n     C   |   100     |    4.0    |   6.0    |    6.0    |   .353   |   2.12\r\n     D   |   100     |    4.5    |   6.5    |    6.5    |   .353   |   2.29\r\n     E   |   100     |    5.0    |   7.0    |    7.0    |   .353   |   2.47\r\n  ===========================================================================\r\n\r\n\r\n  TABLE XXIX\r\n\r\n  SHOWING THE COMPARISON OF THE DIFFERENT METHODS\r\n  OF PAYING FOR MILK AT CHEESE FACTORIES\r\n\r\n  ================================================================\r\n         |            | ERROR IN PAYMENT PER 100 POUNDS OF MILK BY\r\n  PATRON | PERCENTAGE +----------------+-----------+--------------\r\n         | OF FAT IN  | POOLING SYSTEM | FAT BASIS | FAT-PLUS-TWO\r\n         |    MILK    |                |           |   METHOD\r\n  -------+------------+----------------+-----------+--------------\r\n     A   |    3.0     |    +$0.46      |  -$0.08   |   +$0.10\r\n     B   |    3.5     |     +0.23      |   -0.04   |    +0.05\r\n     C   |    4.0     |      0.00      |    0.00   |     0.00\r\n     D   |    4.5     |     -0.23      |   +0.04   |    -0.05\r\n     E   |    5.0     |     -0.46      |   +0.08   |    -0.10\r\n  ================================================================\r\n\r\nA careful study of the above table shows that the pooling system is in\r\nfavor of the dairy-man with the poor milk, and that the fat basis favors\r\nthe dairy-man with the rich milk. This is due, of course, to the fact\r\nthat the casein does not increase in the milk quite in proportion to the\r\nfat. With the pooling system or fat basis of payment, no account is\r\ntaken of the casein; but the fat-plus-two system is an attempt to\r\nrecognize the casein, but considers the percentage of casein in all milk\r\nto be the same. This method is in favor of the dairy-man with milk low\r\nin fat, but not to the extent of the pooling system. The latter system\r\nconsiders the cheese-producing power of all milk to be the same. It\r\nfavors the dairy-man with low-testing milk. The fat basis for payment\r\nrecognizes only the fat and is an advantage to the dairy-man with the\r\nhigh-testing milk but not to the extent that the pooling system is in\r\nfavor of the low-testing milk. The fat-plus-two method recognizes 2 per\r\ncent of casein in the milk. This favors the dairy-men with low-testing\r\nmilk. Other methods[136] of paying for milk have been devised. Because\r\nthe actual yield of cheese from the milk of different herds cannot be\r\neasily determined at the cheese factory, this method of payment cannot\r\nbe employed. In localities in which all the dairy-men have the same\r\nbreed of cattle and there is not a wide variation in the fat percentage,\r\nthe fat basis is usually found to be the most satisfactory way to pay\r\nfor the milk.\r\n\r\n+327. Laws governing the production and sale of milk.+--Many states have\r\nlaws regulating the sanitary conditions under which the milk may be\r\nproduced. These laws relate principally to the condition of the stables,\r\nthe health of the cow, the food given the cow, and the care of the milk.\r\nThe following law[137] of Wisconsin is a good example:\r\n\r\n  \"Adulterated milk, what constitutes. Section 4607a. In all\r\n  prosecutions under the preceding section, or any other\r\n  section of these statutes, or laws amendatory thereof or\r\n  supplementary thereto, relating to the sale of adulterated\r\n  milk or adulterated cream, the term adulterated milk shall\r\n  mean: milk containing less than three per centum of milk\r\n  fat, or milk containing less than eight and one-half per\r\n  centum of milk solids not fat, or milk drawn from cows\r\n  within eight days before or four days after parturition,\r\n  or milk from which any part of the cream has been\r\n  removed, or milk which has been diluted with water or any\r\n  other fluid, or milk to which has been added or into which\r\n  has been introduced any coloring matter or chemical or\r\n  preservative or deleterious or filthy substance or any\r\n  foreign substance whatsoever, or milk drawn from cows kept\r\n  in a filthy or unhealthy condition, or milk drawn from any\r\n  sick or diseased cow or cow having ulcers or other running\r\n  sores, or milk drawn from cows fed unwholesome food, or\r\n  milk in any stage of putrefaction, or milk contaminated by\r\n  being kept in stables containing cattle or other animals.\r\n  The term adulterated cream shall mean cream containing\r\n  less than eighteen per centum of milk fat, or cream taken\r\n  from milk drawn from cows within eight days before or four\r\n  days after parturition, or cream from milk to which has\r\n  been added or introduced any coloring matter or chemical\r\n  or preservative or deleterious or filthy substance or any\r\n  foreign substance whatsoever, or cream from milk drawn\r\n  from cows kept in a filthy or unhealthy condition, or\r\n  cream from milk drawn from any sick or diseased cow or cow\r\n  having ulcers or other running sores, or cream from milk\r\n  drawn from cows fed unwholesome food, or cream\r\n  contaminated by being kept in stables containing cattle or\r\n  other animals, or cream to which has been added or into\r\n  which has been introduced any coloring matter or chemical\r\n  or preservative or deleterious or filthy substance or any\r\n  foreign substance whatsoever, or cream in any stage of\r\n  putrefaction, provided, that nothing in this act shall be\r\n  construed to prohibit the sale of pasteurized milk or\r\n  cream to which viscogen or sucrate of lime has been added\r\n  solely for the purpose of restoring the viscosity, if the\r\n  same be distinctly labeled in such manner as to advise the\r\n  purchaser of its true character; and providing that\r\n  nothing in this act shall be construed as prohibiting the\r\n  sale of milk commonly known as 'skimmed milk,' when the\r\n  same is sold as and for 'skimmed milk.' Milk drawn from\r\n  cows within eight days before or four days after\r\n  parturition, or milk to which has been added or into which\r\n  has been introduced any coloring matter or chemical or\r\n  preservative or deleterious or filthy substance, or milk\r\n  drawn from cows kept in a filthy or unclean condition, or\r\n  milk drawn from any sick or diseased cow or cow having\r\n  ulcers or other running sores, or milk drawn from cows\r\n  fed unwholesome food, or milk contaminated by being kept\r\n  in stables containing cattle or other animals and cream\r\n  from any such milk, or cream in any stage of putrefaction\r\n  are hereby declared to be unclean and unsanitary milk or\r\n  unclean and unsanitary cream, as the case may be.\"\r\n\r\nMost states have laws which determine the legal standard of milk. Any\r\none selling milk which does not meet this standard is liable to be\r\nfined. The laws of most states prohibit the taking of anything from the\r\nmilk or the adding of anything to it. This prohibits the skimming and\r\nwatering. Skimmed-milk must be sold as such.\r\n\r\n+328. Marketing of cheese.+--There are many different methods[138] of\r\nselling cheese. Each is adapted to certain conditions and each has its\r\nadvantages and disadvantages. In cheese sections, the customary method\r\nof selling is on the board of trade, which is the meeting of the\r\ncheese-buyers and factory salesmen. They meet at a given place at a\r\ncertain day and hour each week. Every board has its officers. There are\r\ndifferent ways in which a board of trade may be operated. In some cases\r\nthere is a large blackboard divided into columns. In the first column,\r\nthe salesman writes the name of the factory and the number and kind of\r\ncheese offered for sale. At the top of the other columns are the names\r\nof the different cheese-buyers. The president usually opens the sale at\r\na stated time and asks that all cheese be placed on the blackboard. When\r\nthis is done he states that they are ready to receive bids on the\r\ncheese. The buyers then write the price a pound they wish to pay\r\nopposite each lot of cheese and in the column headed by their names.\r\nAfter all the bids have been received and placed on the board, the\r\npresiding officer states that a certain length of time, usually fifteen\r\nminutes, will be given the salesman to withdraw his cheese if he does\r\nnot think a high enough price has been offered; this is indicated by the\r\nsalesman stepping to the blackboard and erasing the factory name and\r\nnumber of boxes. At the close of the stated time, the presiding officer\r\ndeclares the cheese offered on the board sold to the highest bidder. The\r\npurchaser then gives the salesman directions for shipping.\r\n\r\nSometimes a board of trade has a committee of one member elected by the\r\nfactory salesmen and one elected by the cheese-buyers. These two members\r\nelect a third and these three constitute the price committee. This\r\ncommittee meets each week and determines what the price shall be. This\r\nis known as the ruling. The factory salesmen and cheese-buyers then try\r\nto make private sales. By this method no one, except the persons\r\nconcerned, knows exactly what price is paid for the cheese. Usually, a\r\nprice above the ruling is paid.\r\n\r\nAt Quebec, Canada, there is a cheese-selling organization with\r\ngovernment assistance. On paying a certain fee, any cheese factory may\r\njoin. All the factories belonging to the organization ship their cheese\r\nto a central cold storage where the cheeses are examined and graded by a\r\ngovernment inspector. A cheese from each vat is tried. These cheeses are\r\nseparated into white and colored lots, then graded according to quality.\r\nWhen the total number of cheeses in each lot is known, the lots are sold\r\nat auction. The purchaser must accept the cheese as graded. The better\r\ngrades of cheese bring about the same price as on the market, but the\r\nadvantage lies in the selling of the lower grades. Ordinarily, the\r\npurchaser takes advantage of the salesman when the cheeses are\r\nundergrade. The success of this plan depends on the accuracy of the\r\nperson grading the cheese. This method seems to be growing in\r\npopularity, because the cheese-buyer can purchase large amounts of\r\ncheese at one time and be sure of the quality. A small fee, about\r\none-twelfth of a cent a pound, is charged for handling the cheese.\r\nSimilar organizations are in operation in Wisconsin. The boards of trade\r\nand selling organizations deal almost entirely in Cheddar cheese.\r\n\r\n+329. Mercantile exchanges.+--In the larger cities are exchanges where\r\ncheese is bought and sold by jobbers. This cheese is mostly Cheddar. The\r\nprices paid these jobbers tend to fix the daily price of cheese. These\r\nprices are published daily, for example, in New York Price Current. Some\r\nfactories ship their cheese directly to these jobbers. The following are\r\nthe cheese rules of the New York Mercantile Exchange adopted May 4,\r\n1915:\r\n\r\n  CHEESE RULES OF THE NEW YORK MERCANTILE EXCHANGE\r\n\r\n  Rule 1. At the first regular meeting of the Executive\r\n  Committee in each year, the President shall appoint,\r\n  subject to the approval of the Executive Committee, a\r\n  Cheese Committee to consist of seven members of the\r\n  Exchange, who are known as members of the cheese trade, to\r\n  hold office until their successors are appointed. It shall\r\n  be the duty of the Cheese Committee to formulate such\r\n  rules and regulations as may be necessary for the\r\n  government of transactions between members of the\r\n  Exchange, and to revise the same as circumstances may\r\n  require. Such rules and revisions shall be subject to the\r\n  approval of the Executive Committee.\r\n\r\n  Rule 2. All transactions in cheese between members of the\r\n  Exchange shall be governed by the following rules, but\r\n  nothing therein shall be construed as interfering, in any\r\n  way, with the rights of members to make such special\r\n  contracts or conditions as they may desire.\r\n\r\n  Rule 3. If a sale is made from dock, or platform, or to\r\n  arrive, the buyer shall assume the same relations toward\r\n  the transportation line by which the cheese arrives, as\r\n  the seller previously held as regards its removal from the\r\n  place of delivery within the time granted by such lines\r\n  for that purpose. Transactions between members of this\r\n  Exchange shall be governed as follows: Any member\r\n  negotiating for any lot of cheese belonging to another\r\n  member, the price having been agreed upon, shall examine\r\n  such lot of cheese within twenty-four (24) hours after\r\n  such negotiation takes place. Failure to examine within\r\n  said time releases the seller from any obligations to make\r\n  delivery thereafter, if he so wishes.\r\n\r\n  Rule 4. In the absence of special agreement, all cheese\r\n  purchased \"in store\" shall be understood as being ready\r\n  and designed for immediate delivery, but the buyer shall\r\n  have twenty-four hours in which to have the cheese\r\n  inspected, and weight tested, and shall not be liable for\r\n  the storage and insurance, if removed within two days.\r\n\r\n  Rule 5. When cheese are sold to arrive, or from depot or\r\n  dock, the cheese must be accepted or rejected within six\r\n  business hours after notice of actual arrival to buyer.\r\n  Business hours shall be understood to be from 10 A.M. to 4\r\n  P.M. If buyer rejects the same, he shall state the reasons\r\n  for rejection. Should the rejection be considered unfair,\r\n  the seller shall at once notify the buyer that he declines\r\n  to accept such rejection; and he may call for a Committee,\r\n  which shall be composed of three members of the cheese\r\n  trade; the seller choosing one, the buyer one, and the\r\n  third selected from the cheese trade by these two, or,\r\n  they failing to agree, the third shall be appointed by the\r\n  Chairman of the Committee on Cheese. The Examining\r\n  Committee shall at once inspect the lot of cheese in\r\n  dispute, sampling not less than five (5) per cent of each\r\n  mark or factory, and they shall immediately give their\r\n  decision in writing to both parties. Either party failing\r\n  to abide by the decision of the Committee may be summoned\r\n  by the other party before the Complaint Committee under\r\n  Section 24 of the By-laws. The fees for each examination\r\n  shall be six ($6) dollars, to be paid by the party\r\n  adjudged to be in fault.\r\n\r\n  Rule 6. The weight of all cheese shall be tested by a\r\n  regularly appointed official weigher, and his certificates\r\n  shall accompany the document conveying the title of the\r\n  property. Said official weigher to be appointed by the\r\n  Committee on Cheese, subject to the approval of the\r\n  Executive Committee.\r\n\r\n  Rule 7. The weigher's fee shall be twenty-five (25) cents\r\n  per factory except where the owner requires more than ten\r\n  (10) boxes be tested in which case the fee shall be fifty\r\n  (50) cents, which shall be paid by the seller.\r\n\r\n  Rule 8. Unless otherwise agreed upon in testing the weight\r\n  of cheese, not less than five (5) boxes or more than ten\r\n  (10) per cent of the whole lot shall be a test, and said\r\n  test shall be considered good for three (3) business days,\r\n  including day test is made.\r\n\r\n  Rule 9. In testing weights, all over and short weights\r\n  shall be taken into the average on each particular\r\n  factory. Single Daisies shall be tested on half pounds,\r\n  Double Daisies and all other sizes on even pounds.\r\n\r\n  Rule 10. Where a lot of cheese is found to test irregular\r\n  in weights, either the buyer or seller may require the\r\n  entire lot to be reweighed. The charge for same shall be\r\n  three (3) cents per box.\r\n\r\n  Rule 11. Boxes of cheese which may be found largely at\r\n  variance from original weights shall not enter into the\r\n  average, but their weight shall be separately ascertained\r\n  and certified to by the weigher.\r\n\r\n  Rule 12. Where sales are made, and the buyer finds damaged\r\n  or sour cheese in excess of fifteen (15) per cent it shall\r\n  be optional with him to refuse or receive the remainder of\r\n  the lot purchased. But, in the event of his accepting the\r\n  remainder of the lot, the sour or damaged cheese shall\r\n  revert to the seller.\r\n\r\n  Rule 13. The Committee on Cheese shall appoint subject to\r\n  the approval of the Executive Committee, a Cheese\r\n  Inspector and also a Deputy Inspector, whose duties shall\r\n  be, when called upon by members of the Exchange, to\r\n  inspect the quality and condition of such lots of cheese\r\n  as may be required and to render a certificate of such\r\n  inspection. Where the cheese in the lots are reasonably\r\n  uniform in quality, the examination of 10 per cent of the\r\n  lot shall be considered sufficient, but this shall not\r\n  prevent the Inspector examining a larger percentage of the\r\n  lot, when he deems it necessary. The fee for inspection\r\n  shall be fifty (50) cents for lots consisting of fifty\r\n  (50) boxes or less. Lots exceeding fifty (50) boxes shall\r\n  be one cent per box, which shall be collected from the\r\n  member ordering the inspection.\r\n\r\n  Rule 14. The Cheese Inspector's certificate shall be made\r\n  to read as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n  NEW YORK MERCANTILE EXCHANGE\r\n\r\n  _Cheese Inspector's Certificate_\r\n\r\n  Inspection No.__________\r\n\r\n  This is to certify that I have this day inspected for M___________\r\n  the following cheese, now located at_____________________\r\n  Factory and identification marks_________________________\r\n  Quantity in lot__________________________________________boxes\r\n  Quantity inspected_______________________________________boxes\r\n  and find as follows:\r\n  Flavor_______________________________________________________________\r\n  Body and Texture_____________________________________________________\r\n  Color________________________________________________________________\r\n  Condition____________________________________________________________\r\n  Boxes________________________________________________________________\r\n  Grade________________________________________________________________\r\n  Inspection charges________________\r\n\r\n  _____________________________________Inspector_\r\n\r\n  The certificate to have a blank margin of three inches at\r\n  the bottom, for the purpose of inserting specifications of\r\n  Institutions, also for cheese sold under the Call, so that\r\n  the Inspector may certify that cheese inspected fill the\r\n  requirements as specified and the Inspector shall brand\r\n  one impression on both boxes and cheese.\r\n\r\n  NEW YORK MERCANTILE EXCHANGE\r\n\r\n  OFFICIAL INSPECTION\r\n\r\n  Number_______________ Date___________________________\r\n\r\n  ____________________________Inspector_\r\n\r\n  Rule 16.

Members offering cheese for sale under the Call\r\n  shall describe each lot, as to number of boxes, color,\r\n  texture (open or close made), body, flavor, size, and how\r\n  boxed, section where made, whether whole milks or skims\r\n  and the average weight of each lot. Cheese sold under the\r\n  Call to be accepted, or rejected, as a good delivery, or\r\n  otherwise, based on the description given at the sale.\r\n\r\n  Rule 18. When cheese are sold under the Call, unless\r\n  otherwise stated, they shall be ready for immediate\r\n  shipment.\r\n\r\n  Rule 19. All cheese offered under the Call, with\r\n  Inspector's Certificate attached, shall be accompanied by\r\n  such Certificate and be accepted by the buyer\r\n  unconditionally, provided the cheese are branded according\r\n  to Rule 13.\r\n\r\n  Rule 20. When cheese are offered under the Call, without\r\n  Inspector's Certificate, should the buyer not consider the\r\n  cheese a good delivery, according to description by\r\n  seller, he may notify the seller, and if the seller is\r\n  unwilling to make another delivery, the buyer may call\r\n  upon the Inspector to decide whether or not the delivery\r\n  shall stand. If the Inspector decides it is a good\r\n  delivery, the buyer shall accept the cheese. If the\r\n  Inspector decides it is not a good delivery, then the\r\n  seller shall have twenty-four (24) hours in which to make\r\n  a good delivery. But if the seller, after twenty-four (24)\r\n  hours, fails to make a good delivery, then the buyer shall\r\n  notify the Superintendent of the Exchange, who shall\r\n  collect a penalty of three per cent of the amount of the\r\n  transaction, the Exchange retaining twenty-five per cent\r\n  of this sum, and seventy-five per cent shall be paid to\r\n  the buyer.\r\n\r\n  Rule 21. Spot sales under the Call shall be for spot cash\r\n  unless otherwise agreed.\r\n\r\n  Rule 22. All failures in meeting contracts shall be\r\n  reported to the Superintendent of the Exchange, and\r\n  announced at next regular session of the Exchange.\r\n\r\n+330. Marketing perishable varieties.+--Soft cheeses, such as Cream,\r\nNeufchâtel, Cottage, are usually sold to jobbers or directly to retail\r\nstores. They have a very short commercial life, hence cannot be held\r\nlong before delivery to the consumer. From the jobber, cheese usually\r\ngoes to the wholesale grocer and then to the retail dealer and finally\r\nthe consumer. Most jobbers have cold storages so that they can hold\r\ncheese without injury to quality. (See Fig. 74.) The kind of cheese\r\nmarketed in any locality depends on the tastes of the residents. For\r\nexample, the South usually desires a highly colored product, thinking\r\nthis color indicates more fat; in the Cheddar group New England demands\r\na soft pasty quick-curing cheese, thinking that softness is a sign of\r\nmore fat and richness; England wants a rather dry, well-cured, highly\r\nflavored cheese. Canadian Cheddar cheese has been standardized as far\r\nas possible to appeal to the English market. A long ripening period\r\nkeeps capital tied up through the further time required for delivery.\r\nThis has led to the sale of much of the cheese almost or entirely\r\nunripe. So much of the product has reached the consumer without\r\ncharacteristic varietal flavor that large numbers have acquired the\r\nhabit of purchasing and even preferring cheese only partly ripe.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 74.--A cheese cold storage room.]\r\n\r\nThe time during which cheese should be held at the factory depends on\r\nthe variety. Some are shipped as soon as made, including those cheeses\r\nwith sour-milk flavor only. Others have to be cured in the factory from\r\nsix to eight weeks. Cheeses in paper or tin-foil should be neatly\r\nwrapped and carefully put in the boxes. The box of cheese should be\r\nneat, clean and attractive. Cheeses not wrapped should have a firm rind\r\nto hold them in shape. The boxes should be clean and the weight of\r\ncheese neatly and plainly marked. In the case of Cheddar cheese, it may\r\nbe paraffined at the factory, but if not, this is usually done at the\r\ncold storage of the jobber. The cheeses usually have some time to cure\r\nor ripen while being handled by the various dealers.\r\n\r\n+331. Distribution of price.+--The final selling price of cheese is a\r\ncomposite of all the changes that have gone before; or conversely, the\r\nfarmer, the maker, the carrier and the distributors (wholesale, jobbing\r\nand retail dealers) must all be paid from the final price of the\r\nproduct. A study of this problem in Wisconsin has been made by Hibbard,\r\nand Hobson.[139] The general facts as determined for Wisconsin have\r\nfairly wide application to the manufacture and sale of cheese.\r\n\r\nEconomic success in handling cheese is dependent on proper provision for\r\nthe sale of the product. Where the output is small, a personal market\r\ncan be created and maintained. This eliminates all profits intervening\r\nbetween the maker and the retailer. If the business reaches a volume\r\nbeyond the possibilities of direct sale to the retailer, some selling\r\norganization is necessary. Where the number of producers is great and\r\nthe selling machinery is well organized, the cheese factory becomes a\r\nproducer of a commodity which is turned over to existing selling\r\nagencies. This condition is well established for Cheddar, Swiss, Brick\r\nand Limburger cheese. The soft cheeses other than Limburger have thus\r\nfar been handled principally by large companies, each of which has\r\ndeveloped an expensive selling organization. A study of the map (Fig.\r\n65) shows how the cheese industry is localized in particular sections of\r\ncertain states. Individual factories have maintained themselves in\r\nwidely separated places. This localization is due to the geographical\r\nconditions which make certain regions specially adapted to dairying,\r\nmodified by the proximity to markets for milk as milk. There are many\r\nregions, however, well adapted to cheese production in which there is no\r\ndevelopment of the industry at present. New developments are now taking\r\nplace in the mountain areas of the South, notably North Carolina and\r\nadjacent states, and in several centers of the western mountain states.\r\nMany other areas should develop the making of cheese in some form.\r\n\r\nThe actual costs of making and selling cheese were found by the\r\nWisconsin investigators to vary approximately as follows: (1) cost of\r\nmaking, 1.2 to 1.75 cents; (2) storage, 1/8 cent a pound a month, or\r\n3/8 to ½ cent for the season; (3) transportation to distant points,\r\n$.20 to $2.50 for 100 pounds according to distance; (4) the local\r\ndealer, about 1 cent a pound; (5) the wholesale dealer, 2 cents; (6) the\r\njobber or broker who occasionally intervenes, about 1/8 to ¼ cent; and\r\nthe retailer, 5.5 to 9 cents. The entire cost of selling at the time\r\nthis investigation was made represented about one-half of the retail\r\nprice of the cheese. The producer of milk received the other half of\r\nthat price.\r\n\r\n+332. Standards.+--Legal standards in the United States are thus far\r\nlargely based on the specifications of American Cheddar. In so far as\r\nthey are applied to other products, they operate merely to prevent or\r\nreduce the use of skimmed-milk. The analyses and limits proposed in the\r\ndiscussion of varieties or groups in this book represent the range of\r\ncomposition actually known to be associated with cheeses of typical\r\nquality. Efforts are now being made to establish definitions and\r\nstandards of composition which will limit the use of cheese names to\r\nproducts conforming to the requirements for such varieties. Practically\r\nthe only federal requirement thus far enforced in the United States is\r\nthat 50 per cent of the water-free substance of the cheese must be\r\nmilk-fat. Various states have local requirements but most of them\r\ninclude the federal rule as to fat. New York and Wisconsin now restrict\r\nthe amount of water in Cheddar cheese to 40 per cent. Most states have\r\nlaws regulating the manufacture and sale of skimmed-milk cheese.\r\n\r\n+333. Laws relating to cheese marketing.+--A cheese of foreign origin if\r\nmade in this country must be branded to show that it is not imported.\r\nFor example, Camembert made in America is labeled Domestic Camembert.\r\nSome manufacturers call it Camembert type of cheese. The same applies to\r\nother varieties of foreign cheese. If a variety is made under a\r\ntrade-marked name, this prevents any other manufacturer from using that\r\nname. For example, a concern may make \"Philadelphia\" cream cheese; other\r\nconcerns may make cream cheese, but they must call it by some other\r\nname.\r\n\r\nThe committee on definitions and standards for the Association of\r\nOfficial Agricultural Chemists has now undertaken to define the proper\r\nuse of type names. This is intended to determine the proper limits of\r\ncomposition of cheeses in each variety and such essentials of physical\r\nidentification as will insure the proper use of these names.\r\n\r\nCertain states have laws which relate to the branding of the cheese to\r\ndenote quality. If the cheese is made from whole milk, a brand may be\r\napplied to show this fact. This is usually called the state brand. If\r\nmade from skimmed-milk, the cheese must be branded to show this. The\r\nfollowing[140] illustrate the laws relating to the state brand and\r\nskimmed-milk cheese:\r\n\r\n  Sec. 48. Manufacturer's brand of cheese. \"Every\r\n  manufacturer of whole-milk cheese may put a brand or label\r\n  upon such cheese indicating 'whole-milk cheese' and the\r\n  date of the month and year when made; and no person shall\r\n  use such a brand or label upon any cheese made from milk\r\n  from which any of the cream has been taken. The\r\n  Commissioner of Agriculture shall procure and issue to the\r\n  cheese manufacturers of the state, on proper application\r\n  therefor, and under such regulations as to the custody and\r\n  use thereof as he may prescribe, a uniform stencil brand\r\n  or labels bearing a suitable device or motto, and the\r\n  words 'New York state whole-milk cheese.' Every such\r\n  brand or label shall be used upon the outside of the\r\n  cheese and shall bear a different number for each separate\r\n  factory. The commissioner shall keep a book, in which\r\n  shall be registered the name, location and number of each\r\n  manufactory using the brands or labels, and the name or\r\n  names of the persons at each manufactory authorized to use\r\n  the same. No such brand or labels shall be used upon any\r\n  other than whole-milk cheese or packages containing the\r\n  same. (As amended by chapter 207 of the Laws of 1910.)\r\n\r\n  Sec. 49. Use of false brand prohibited; branding of\r\n  skim-milk cheese regulated. No person shall offer, sell or\r\n  expose for sale, in any package, butter or cheese which is\r\n  falsely branded or labeled. No person shall sell, offer or\r\n  expose for sale cheese commonly known as Cheddar cheese\r\n  made from skimmed or partially skimmed milk unless the\r\n  same is branded to show that it is skim-milk cheese. All\r\n  such cheese so sold, offered or exposed for sale shall be\r\n  branded with the words 'skim-milk cheese,' or if such\r\n  cheese contains thirteen per centum of milk fat or over,\r\n  it may be branded 'medium skim-milk cheese,' or if it\r\n  contains eighteen per centum of milk fat or over, it may\r\n  be branded 'special skim-milk cheese.' Such branding shall\r\n  be upon the sides of both the cheese and the container.\r\n  The branding herein provided shall be in block letters at\r\n  least one-half an inch square. (As amended by chapter 456\r\n  of the Laws of 1913.)\"\r\n\r\nFilled cheeses are those from which the milk-fat has been removed and\r\nother animal fats substituted. The laws of some states prohibit the\r\nmanufacture of this product. The federal law relating to filled cheese\r\npermits its manufacture under license, taxes and government inspection.\r\n\r\nThe various states have laws regulating the length of time that the\r\ncheese may be held in cold storage.\r\n\r\nAnother important law in some states requires the cheese-maker to have a\r\nlicense. He must pass an examination to show that the principles and\r\npractices of cheese-making are understood.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI\r\n\r\n_CHEESE IN THE HOUSEHOLD_\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough cheese in some form is familiar to every household, it has been\r\nwidely regarded in America as an accessory, almost a condimental\r\nsubstance rather than as a staple food worthy of comparison with meat or\r\neggs. Statistics of the annual production, importation and exportation\r\nof cheese indicate that the total consumption in the United States is\r\nabout 300,000,000 pounds--perhaps three pounds per capita. The household\r\nmanufacture and consumption of cottage cheese would add a small amount\r\nto these figures.\r\n\r\nCheese is used as a staple source of food values among many peoples of\r\nEurope. Such use of cheese increases rather than decreases with the\r\ndensity of the population. France with a small fraction of the land area\r\nand one-half the population of the United States produces and consumes\r\nabout the same amount of cheese. In America, cheese-making has been\r\ndeveloped with the advance of settlement into unoccupied territories\r\nonly to be dropped as increasing population produced greater demands for\r\nmilk in other forms. If cheese had been accepted as a regular part of\r\nthe food supply in such communities, some form of cheese-making would\r\nhave survived the economic changes.\r\n\r\n+334. Food value of cheese.+--A consideration of the nutritive\r\ncomponents of cheese shows it to be a rich source of fat, protein or\r\nboth, according to the variety under examination. It is low in\r\ncarbohydrates, and aside from salt (sodium chloride) compares favorably\r\nwith other substances in mineral constituents. The following discussion\r\nwith an amplified table is taken from Langworthy and Hunt:[141]\r\n\r\n\"In order, however, that the question of the use of cheese in the diet\r\nmay be adequately discussed, knowledge of its composition in comparison\r\nwith other foods is desirable, and there is an abundance of data\r\navailable on this subject, since the composition of cheese and other\r\nfoods has often been investigated at the Department of Agriculture, in\r\nexperiment station laboratories and in many other places where nutrition\r\nproblems are studied. An extended summary of analyses of cheese of\r\ndifferent sorts is included in an earlier publication of this\r\ndepartment.[142]\r\n\r\n\"Data regarding the composition of cheese and a few other common foods\r\nare summarized in the following table.\r\n\r\n\"It will be seen from the table (Table XXX) that cheese has nearly twice\r\nas much protein, weight for weight, as beef of average composition as\r\npurchased and that its fuel value is more than twice as great. It\r\ncontains over 25 per cent more protein than the same weight of\r\nporterhouse steak as purchased, and nearly twice as much fat.\r\n\r\n\"As shown by the figures in the following table, cheese contains 3.8 per\r\ncent ash. Of this a considerable part may be salt added in\r\ncheese-making. Like the milk from which it is made, cheese ash is\r\ncharacterized chiefly by the presence of calcium (lime), magnesium,\r\nphosphorus and iron, the average values as given in earlier bulletins of\r\nthe department[145] being 1.24 per cent calcium oxid, 0.049 per cent\r\nmagnesium oxid, 1.49 per cent phosphorus pentoxid, and 0.0015 per cent\r\niron.\"\r\n\r\n  TABLE XXX\r\n\r\n  AVERAGE

in the last column, that Cheddar\r\ncheese takes first rank among the foods compared as to fuel value. The\r\nestimate of food values in terms of calories may not completely express\r\nthe value of that food to a particular individual. It is generally\r\nconceded that one great function of food is the production of energy and\r\nthis function is probably more closely determined by the number of\r\ncalories produced than in any other known way. Such calculation has\r\nbecome an essential factor in the preparation of dietaries. The\r\ncalculation here given necessarily applies only to Cheddar cheese. By\r\neasy use of the last column, the caloric value of this cheese can be\r\ncompared with that of any competing food and the relative economy\r\ndetermined, whatever the price asked. Another recent calculation with\r\nreference[146] to the same cheese follows:\r\n\r\n\"One pound of American Cheddar cheese contains as much protein as--\r\n\r\n  1.57 pounds of sirloin steak.\r\n  1.35 pounds of round steak.\r\n  1.89 pounds of fowl.\r\n  1.79 pounds of smoked ham.\r\n  1.81 pounds of fresh ham.\r\n\r\n\"In order to judge the value of foods fairly not only the protein but\r\nthe energy also must be compared. To supply energy cheese is one of the\r\nbest of food products. On the basis of energy supplied, 1 pound of\r\ncheese equals--\r\n\r\n  1.98 pounds of sirloin steak.\r\n  2.61 pounds of round steak.\r\n  2.52 pounds of fowl.\r\n  1.17 pounds of smoked ham.\r\n  1.29 pounds of fresh ham.\"\r\n\r\nAll these discussions have applied to whole-milk Cheddar cheese. With\r\nminor reductions, much the same figures will hold for Swiss, Limburger,\r\nBrick, Munster, Edam.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, very little has been published until recently on the\r\nskimmed-milk cheeses. The food value lost in skimmed-milk has at times\r\nbeen enormous. Many households purchase milk by the bottle, use the\r\ntop-milk as cream and lose a part of the remainder. Similarly creameries\r\nhave wasted tons of skimmed-milk. The recovery of the protein of this\r\nmilk for human food is both good economy and an important addition to\r\nthe dietary. The United States Department of Agriculture has recently\r\npublished the following: \"Cottage cheese is richer in protein than most\r\nmeats and is very much cheaper. Every pound contains more than three\r\nounces of protein, the source of nitrogen for body building. It is a\r\nvaluable source of energy also, though not so high as foods with more\r\nfat. It follows that its value in this respect can be greatly increased\r\nby serving it with cream, as is so commonly done.\"\r\n\r\nIt is an open question whether the decline of cheese-making in America\r\nis not due to our failure to develop the use of skim and part-skim\r\ncheeses. The whole-milk cheeses are very rich in fat. Use of such cheese\r\nin quantity in connection with ordinary foods quickly leads to the\r\ningestion of too much fat. The skimmed-milk cheeses are primarily\r\nprotein food and as such substitutes for lean meat.\r\n\r\n\"The following table shows that cottage cheese is much cheaper than\r\nmost meats in furnishing protein for the diet.\r\n\r\n\"For supplying protein, one pound of cottage cheese equals:\r\n\r\n  1.27 pounds sirloin steak.\r\n  1.09 pounds round steak.\r\n  1.37 pounds chuck rib beef.\r\n  1.52 pounds fowl.\r\n  1.46 pounds fresh ham.\r\n  1.44 pounds smoked ham.\r\n  1.58 pounds loin pork chop.\r\n  1.31 pounds hind leg of lamb.\r\n  1.37 pounds breast of veal.\r\n\r\n\"In addition to protein, energy for performing body work must be\r\nfurnished by food. As a source of energy also, cottage cheese is cheaper\r\nthan most meats at present prices. The following table shows the\r\ncomparison when energy is considered.\r\n\r\n\"On the basis of energy supplied, one pound of cottage cheese equals:\r\n\r\n  8-1/3   ounces sirloin steak.\r\n  11¼     ounces round steak.\r\n  11¼     ounces chuck rib beef.\r\n  10¾     ounces fowl.\r\n  5½      ounces fresh ham.\r\n  5       ounces smoked ham.\r\n  6       ounces loin pork chop.\r\n  7-1/3   ounces hind leg of lamb.\r\n  12¾     ounces breast of veal.\"\r\n\r\n+335. Digestibility of cheese.+--Although it has been a staple food with\r\nmany races for uncounted years, there is a widespread belief that cheese\r\nis suitable for use chiefly in small quantities as an accessory to the\r\ndiet, and that in large quantities it is likely to produce physiological\r\ndisturbances. The question of digestibility was made the subject of a\r\nspecial investigation by the United States Department of\r\nAgriculture.[147] Calorimeter experiments[148] were made to test the\r\ndigestibility of several varieties of cheese and some of these varieties\r\nat various stages of ripening. All forms of cheese were found to be\r\ndigested as completely as most of the usual forms of food. Approximately\r\n90 per cent of the nitrogenous portion (casein) was retained in the\r\nbody. Unripe cheese in these experiments was apparently digested as\r\ncompletely as the ripened forms. These experiments make clear the\r\npossibility of making cheese a more prominent article in the regular\r\ndietary than is usual in America. They especially point to the\r\ndesirability of the use of the skim and partially skim cheeses, which as\r\ncheap sources of protein when properly combined with other foods, may be\r\nmade to replace meats as a less costly source of proteins. Cheese is\r\nthen to be classed with meat and eggs, not with condiments. An ounce of\r\nCheddar[149] cheese roughly is equivalent to one egg, to a glass of\r\nmilk, or to two ounces of meat. It is properly to be combined with\r\nbread, potatoes and other starchy foods, lacking in the fat in which the\r\ncheese is rich. These experiments included Roquefort, fresh-made and\r\nripe Cheddar, Swiss, Camembert and Cottage cheese.\r\n\r\n+336. Cheese flavor.+--\"Cheese owes its flavor to the fatty acids and\r\ntheir compounds which it contains and to ammonia-like bodies formed\r\nduring ripening from the cleavage of the casein, to salt added to the\r\ncurd, and in some varieties, like Roquefort, to bodies elaborated by\r\nmolds which develop in the cheese. In the highly flavored sorts some of\r\nthe fatty acids of a very marked odor are present in abundance, as are\r\nalso the ammonia-like bodies. Indeed, in eating such cheese as Camembert\r\na trace of ammonia flavor may often be plainly detected.\r\n\r\n\"The cleavage of the nitrogenous material of the cheese and other\r\nchanges are brought about chiefly by the action of enzymes originally\r\npresent in cheese or by micro-organisms and are to be regarded as\r\nfermentative and not as putrefactive changes.\r\n\r\n\"The liking for highly flavored cheeses of strong odor is a matter of\r\nindividual preference, but from the chemist's standpoint there is no\r\nreason for the statement often made that such cheeses have undergone\r\nputrefactive decomposition.\"\r\n\r\n+337. Relation to health.+--In connection with the use of cheese as a\r\nfood, its relation to the health of the consumer must be considered. The\r\npresence of the bacillus of tuberculosis in milk has led to careful\r\nstudy of its possible presence in cheese. When American Cheddar cheese\r\nwas specially inoculated for this purpose, the living organism was\r\nrecovered from it after about five months by Schroeder of the United\r\nStates Department of Agriculture. This danger is much greater from\r\ncheeses, such as Cream and Neufchâtel, which are eaten when\r\ncomparatively freshly made. The disease has been produced in guinea pigs\r\nfrom such cheese often enough to emphasize the desirability of\r\ndeveloping methods of making every variety possible from thoroughly\r\npasteurized milk. This would remove the danger of tuberculosis and with\r\nit eliminate the possibility of transmitting other diseases.\r\n\r\n+338. Cheese poisoning+[150] cases occasionally occur. These take two\r\nmain forms: (1) an enteritis (caused by _Bacillus enteritidis_) or some\r\nother member of that series which while painful and accompanied by\r\npurging is rarely fatal; (2) acute toxæmias which, although rare,\r\nusually result in death. From the latter type a variety of _Bacillus\r\nbotulinus_, an organism usually associated with meat poisoning, was\r\nisolated by the New York State Department of Health. The occurrence of\r\nsuch cases is frequent enough to emphasize the desirability of using\r\nevery precaution to reduce the number of bacteria that are allowed to\r\nenter milk when drawn and to prevent the development of those which\r\nactually gain access to it. When possible, pasteurization should be\r\nintroduced.\r\n\r\n+339. Proper place in the diet.+--It has already been noted that cheese\r\nis used \"in general in two ways--in small quantities chiefly for its\r\nflavor and in large quantities for its nutritive value as well as for\r\nits flavor. Some varieties of cheese are used chiefly for the first\r\npurpose, others chiefly for the second. Those which are used chiefly for\r\ntheir flavor, many of which are high priced, contribute little to the\r\nfood value of the diet, because of the small quantity used at a time.\r\nThey have an important part to play, however, in making the diet\r\nattractive and palatable. The intelligent housekeeper thinks of them not\r\nas necessities, but as lying within what has been called 'the region of\r\nchoice.' Having first satisfied herself that her family is receiving\r\nsufficient nourishment, she then, according to her means and ideas of an\r\nattractive diet, chooses among these foods and others which are to be\r\nconsidered luxuries.\r\n\r\n\"Those cheeses, on the other hand, which are suitable to be eaten in\r\nlarge quantities and which are comparatively low priced are important\r\nnot only from the point of view of flavor, but also from the point of\r\nview of their nutritive value.\" Among such cheeses are American Cheddar,\r\nSwiss, Brick, Limburger and the lower priced forms of Neufchâtel.\r\n\r\nIt is clear that in buying cheese, the housekeeper should know\r\ndefinitely the dietary purpose of the purchase, and then choose the\r\nvariety of cheese best suited. To a very large degree the personal\r\ntastes of the family determine the kinds of cheese which will be\r\ntolerated when served uncooked. In some families, the strong flavors of\r\nRoquefort or Limburger are not acceptable. However, there is a range of\r\nchoice in which much judgment can be used. Cheese to be served with\r\nmild-flavored foods should as a rule be also mild-flavored. For most\r\nsandwiches, for example, Cheddar or Swiss is usually very acceptable;\r\nBrick or partly ripe Limburger still hard enough to slice cuts into thin\r\nrectangular slices and is very attractive to many consumers because it\r\nhas somewhat more flavor without being too strong. With proper handling\r\nit is good policy to buy the cheapest of these forms for this purpose.\r\nThe selection of dessert cheeses offers the widest range. If served with\r\nmild-flavored crackers, very many persons prefer Cream, Neufchâtel or\r\nmild Cheddar; a little stronger taste calls for club cheese, or\r\nCamembert. If tobacco smoke is present, Roquefort, Gorgonzola, Limburger\r\nand related types will satisfy many consumers better than mild cheeses.\r\nThe intensity of flavor to be sought in the cheese should thus be\r\nadjusted to the food served with it. A person with an aversion to\r\nstrong-smelling or strong-tasting cheese has been frequently known to\r\napprove over-ripe Camembert, or Limburger when served without label but\r\nspread upon a ginger cracker.\r\n\r\nFor cooking purposes, some recipes prescribe cheese of special quality.\r\nIn large markets, old Cheddar ripened carefully for two or three years\r\nis commonly purchasable for Welsh rabbit. (Ask for \"rabbit\" cheese.) An\r\nexpert housekeeper familiar also with cheese ripening has demonstrated\r\nthat almost any cheese, whether ripened to its best, part ripe or\r\nover-ripe, can be used in many cooking formulas without injuring the\r\nacceptability of the product to most consumers. In canning Camembert, it\r\nhas been shown[151] that over-ripe cheese so strong as to be\r\nobjectionable, when sterilized loses the objectionable flavor of the raw\r\nproduct. No cheese should be wasted; any not used when served the first\r\ntime should be served at a closely following meal or used in cooking. No\r\nmatter what the variety, it will add to the food value and palatability\r\nof some one of the common dishes served within forty-eight hours.\r\n\r\n+340. Care of cheese.+[152]--\"One of the best ways of keeping cheese\r\nwhich has been cut is to wrap it in a slightly damp cloth and then in\r\npaper, and to keep it in a cool place. To dampen the cloth, sprinkle it\r\nand then wring it. It should seem hardly damp to the touch. Paraffin\r\npaper may be used in place of the cloth. When cheese is put in a covered\r\ndish, the air should never be wholly excluded, for if this is done, it\r\nmolds more readily.\r\n\r\n\"In some markets it is possible to buy small whole cheeses. These may be\r\nsatisfactorily kept by cutting a slice from the top, to serve as a\r\ncover, and removing the cheese as needed with a knife, a strong spoon,\r\nor a cheese scoop. It is possible to buy at the hardware stores knobs\r\nwhich inserted in the layer cut from the top make it easy to handle.\r\nThe cheese with the cover on should be kept wrapped in a cloth.\"\r\n\r\n+341. Food value and price.+--There is little relation between the price\r\nand food value of standard varieties of cheese. The higher-priced\r\nvarieties claim and hold their place because they possess particular\r\nflavors. These may or may not accompany high comparative food values.\r\nEven among low-priced varieties discrimination into grades is largely\r\nbased on flavor. Of the low-priced cheeses, those made from skimmed-milk\r\ncommonly command the lowest prices. As noted above, a choice may be\r\nbased either on purpose or on price. If the purpose is fixed, the price\r\nshould not change the selection. If, however, a particular quality of\r\ncheese is purchasable at a low price, some satisfactory form of\r\nutilizing it is clearly available to the housekeeper. Some standard\r\nrecipes are given in the following paragraphs.\r\n\r\n+342. Methods and recipes for using cheese.+--(1) As a meat substitute.\r\nMeat is wholesome and relished by most persons, yet it is not essential\r\nto a well-balanced meal and there are many housekeepers who for one\r\nreason or another are interested in lessening the amount of meat or to\r\nsubstitute other foods. The problem with the average family is\r\nundoubtedly more often the occasional substitution of other palatable\r\ndishes for the sake of variety, for reasons of economy, or for some\r\nother reason than the general replacement of meat dishes by other\r\nthings.\r\n\r\nFoods which are to be served in place of meat should be rich in protein\r\nand fat and should also be savory. Cheese naturally suggests itself as a\r\nsubstitute for meat, since it is rich in the same kinds of nutrients\r\nthat meat supplies, is a staple food with which every one is familiar\r\nand is one which can be used in a great variety of ways. In\r\nsubstituting cheese for meat, especial pains should be taken to serve\r\ndishes which are relished by the members of the family. A number of\r\nrecipes[153] for dishes which contain cheese are given below. They are\r\npreceded by several recipes for cheese sauces which, as will appear, are\r\ncalled for in the preparation of some of the more substantial dishes. In\r\nthe first list of recipes, cheese means Cheddar.\r\n\r\n  Cheese Sauce No. 1\r\n\r\n  1 cupful of milk.\r\n  2 tablespoonfuls of flour.\r\n  1 ounce of cheese (¼ cupful of grated cheese).\r\n  Salt and pepper.\r\n\r\n  Thicken the milk with the flour and just before serving\r\n  add the cheese, stirring until it is melted.\r\n\r\n  This sauce is suitable to use in preparing creamed eggs,\r\n  or to pour over toast, making a dish corresponding to\r\n  ordinary milk toast, except for the presence of cheese. It\r\n  may be seasoned with a little curry powder and poured over\r\n  hard-boiled eggs.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Cheese Sauce No. 2\r\n\r\n  Same as cheese sauce No. 1, except that the cheese is\r\n  increased from 1 to 2 ounces.\r\n\r\n  This sauce is suitable for using with macaroni or rice, or\r\n  for baking with crackers soaked in milk.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Cheese Sauce No. 3\r\n\r\n  Same as cheese sauce No. 1, except that two cupfuls of\r\n  grated cheese or 8 ounces are used. This may be used upon\r\n  toast as a substitute for Welsh rabbit.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Cheese Sauce No. 4\r\n\r\n  Same as cheese sauce No. 2, save that 2 tablespoonfuls of\r\n  melted butter are mixed with the flour before the latter\r\n  is put into the milk. This sauce is therefore very rich in\r\n  fat and has only a mild flavor of cheese.\r\n\r\n\r\nAmong the recipes for dishes which may be used like meat, the following\r\ngive products which, eaten in usual quantities, will provide much the\r\nsame kind and amount of nutritive material as the ordinary servings of\r\nmeat dishes used at dinner. In several cases there is a resemblance in\r\nappearance and flavor to common meat dishes, which would doubtless be a\r\npoint in their favor with many families.\r\n\r\n\r\n(2) For general cooking purposes:\r\n\r\n  Cheese Fondue No. 1\r\n\r\n  1-1/3 cupfuls of soft, stale bread crumbs.\r\n\r\n  6 ounces of cheese (1½ cupfuls of grated cheese or\r\n  1-1/3 cupfuls of cheese grated fine or cut into small\r\n  pieces).\r\n\r\n  4 eggs.\r\n\r\n  1 cupful of hot water.\r\n\r\n  ½ teaspoonful of salt.\r\n\r\nMix the water, bread crumbs, salt and cheese; add the yolks\r\nthoroughly beaten; into this mixture cut and fold the whites of\r\neggs beaten until stiff. Pour into a buttered baking dish and\r\ncook 30 minutes in a moderate oven. Serve at once.\r\n\r\nThe food value of this dish, made with the above quantities,\r\nis almost exactly the same as that of a pound of beef of average\r\ncomposition and a pound of potatoes combined. It contains\r\nabout 80 grams of proteids and has a fuel value of about 1300\r\ncalories.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Cheese Fondue No. 2\r\n\r\n  1-1/3 cupfuls of hot milk.\r\n\r\n  1-1/3 cupfuls of soft, stale bread crumbs.\r\n\r\n  1 tablespoonful of butter.\r\n\r\n  4 eggs.\r\n\r\n  1/3 of a pound of cheese (1-1/3 cupfuls of grated cheese\r\n  or 1 cupful of cheese cut into small pieces).\r\n\r\n  ½ teaspoonful of salt.\r\n\r\n  Prepare as in previous recipe.\r\n\r\nThe protein value of this dish is equal to that of 1-1/8 pounds of\r\npotato and beef, the fuel value, however, being much in excess of these.\r\n\r\nIn making either of these fondues, rice or other cereals may be\r\nsubstituted for bread crumbs. One-fourth cupful of rice measured before\r\ncooking, or one cupful of cooked rice or other cereals, should be used.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Corn and Cheese Soufflé\r\n\r\n  1 tablespoonful of butter.\r\n  1 tablespoonful of chopped green pepper.\r\n  ¼ cupful of flour.\r\n  2 cupfuls of milk.\r\n  1 cupful of chopped corn.\r\n  1 cupful of grated cheese,\r\n  3 eggs.\r\n  ½ teaspoonful of salt.\r\n\r\n  Melt the butter and cook the pepper thoroughly in it. Make\r\n  a sauce out of the flour, milk and cheese; add the corn,\r\n  cheese, yolks and seasoning; cut and fold in the whites\r\n  beaten stiffly; turn into a buttered baking dish and bake\r\n  in a moderate oven 30 minutes.\r\n\r\n  Made with skimmed-milk and without butter, this dish has a\r\n  food value slightly in excess of a pound of beef and a\r\n  pound of potatoes.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Cheese Soufflé\r\n\r\n  2 tablespoonfuls of butter.\r\n  3 tablespoonfuls of flour.\r\n  ½ cupful of milk (scalded).\r\n  ½ teaspoonful of salt\r\n  A speck of cayenne.\r\n  ¼ cupful of grated cheese.\r\n  3 eggs.\r\n\r\n  Melt the butter; add the flour and, when well mixed, add\r\n  gradually the scalded milk. Then add salt, cayenne and\r\n  cheese. Remove from the fire and add the yolks of the\r\n  eggs, beaten until lemon colored. Cool the mixture and\r\n  fold into it the whites of the eggs, beaten until stiff.\r\n  Pour into a buttered baking dish and cook 20 minutes in a\r\n  slow oven. Serve at once.\r\n\r\n  The proteid of this recipe is equal to that of half a\r\n  pound of beef; the fuel value is equal to that of\r\n  three-fourths of a pound.\r\n\r\n\r\nWelsh Rabbit\r\n\r\n  1 tablespoonful of butter.\r\n  1 teaspoonful of corn-starch.\r\n  ½ cupful of milk.\r\n  ½ pound of cheese, cut into small pieces.\r\n  ¼ teaspoonful each of salt and mustard.\r\n  A speck of cayenne pepper.\r\n\r\n  Cook the corn-starch in the butter; then add the milk\r\n  gradually and cook two minutes; add the cheese and stir\r\n  until it is melted. Season and serve on crackers or bread\r\n  toasted on one side, the rabbit being poured over the\r\n  untoasted side. Food value is that of about three-fourths\r\n  of a pound of beef.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Macaroni and Cheese No. 1\r\n\r\n  1 cupful of macaroni, broken into small pieces.\r\n  2 quarts of boiling salted water.\r\n  1 cupful of milk.\r\n  2 tablespoonfuls of flour.\r\n  ¼ to ½ pound of cheese.\r\n  ½ teaspoonful of salt.\r\n  Speck of cayenne pepper.\r\n\r\n  Cook the macaroni in the boiling salted water, drain in a\r\n  strainer, and pour cold water over it to prevent the\r\n  pieces from adhering to each other. Make a sauce out of\r\n  the flour, milk, and cheese. Put the sauce and macaroni in\r\n  alternate layers in a buttered baking dish, cover with\r\n  buttered crumbs, and heat in oven until crumbs are brown.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Macaroni and Cheese No. 2\r\n\r\n  A good way to prepare macaroni and cheese is to make a\r\n  rich cheese sauce and heat the macaroni in it. The mixture\r\n  is usually covered with buttered crumbs and browned in the\r\n  oven. The advantage of this way of preparing the dish,\r\n  however, is that it is unnecessary to have a hot oven, as\r\n  the sauce and macaroni may be reheated on the top of the\r\n  stove.\r\n\r\n\r\nBaked Rice and Cheese No. 1\r\n\r\n  1 cupful of uncooked rice and\r\n  4 cupfuls of milk;\r\n      or,\r\n  3 cupfuls of cooked rice and\r\n  1 cupful of milk.\r\n  2 tablespoonfuls of flour.\r\n  ½ pound of cheese.\r\n  ½ teaspoonful of salt.\r\n\r\n  If uncooked rice is used, it should be cooked in 3 cupfuls\r\n  of milk. Make a sauce with one cupful of milk, add the\r\n  flour, cheese and salt. Into a buttered baking dish put\r\n  alternate layers of the cooked rice and the sauce. Cover\r\n  with buttered crumbs and bake until the crumbs are brown.\r\n  The proteids in this dish, made with rice cooked in milk,\r\n  are equal to those of nearly 1¾ pounds of average beef.\r\n  If skimmed-milk is used, the fuel value is equal to nearly\r\n  3½ pounds of beef. Whole milk raises the fuel value\r\n  still higher.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Fried Bread with Cheese No. 1\r\n\r\n  6 slices of bread.\r\n  1 cupful of milk.\r\n  2 ounces of cheese, or ½ cupful of grated cheese.\r\n  ½ teaspoonful of salt.\r\n  ½ teaspoonful of potassium bicarbonate.\r\n  Butter or other fat for frying.\r\n\r\n  Scald the milk with the potassium bicarbonate; add the\r\n  grated cheese, and stir until it dissolves. Dip the bread\r\n  in this mixture and fry it in the butter. The potassium\r\n  bicarbonate helps to keep the cheese in solution. It is\r\n  desirable, however, to keep the milk hot while the bread\r\n  is being dipped.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Plain Cheese Salad\r\n\r\n  Cut Edam or ordinary American cheese into thin pieces,\r\n  scatter them over lettuce leaves and serve with French\r\n  dressing.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Olive and Pimiento Sandwich or Salad Cheese\r\n\r\n  Mash any of the soft cream cheeses and add chopped olives\r\n  and pimientos in equal parts. This mixture requires much\r\n  salt to make it palatable to most palates, the amount\r\n  depending chiefly on the quantity of pimiento used. The\r\n  mixture may be spread between thin slices of bread or it\r\n  may be made into a roll or molded, cut into slices and\r\n  served on lettuce leaves with French dressing.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Cheese and Tomato Salad\r\n\r\n  Stuff cold tomatoes with cream cheese and serve on lettuce\r\n  leaves with French dressing.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Cheese and Pimiento Salad\r\n\r\n  Stuff canned pimientos with cream cheese, cut into slices\r\n  and serve one or two slices to each person on lettuce\r\n  leaves with French dressing.\r\n\r\n  (3) Ways to use cottage cheese. Cottage cheese alone is an\r\n  appetizing and nutritious dish. It may also be served with\r\n  sweet or sour cream, and some persons add a little sugar,\r\n  or chives, chopped onion or caraway seed.\r\n\r\n  The following recipes[154] illustrate a number of ways in\r\n  which cottage cheese may be served:\r\n\r\n\r\n  Cottage Cheese with Preserves and Jellies\r\n\r\n  Pour over cottage cheese any fruit preserves, such as\r\n  strawberries, figs or cherries. Serve with bread or\r\n  crackers. If preferred, cottage cheese balls may be served\r\n  separately and eaten with the preserves. A very attractive\r\n  dish may be made by dropping a bit of jelly into a nest of\r\n  the cottage cheese.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Cottage Cheese Salad\r\n\r\n  Mix thoroughly one pound of cheese, one and one-half\r\n  tablespoonfuls of cream, one tablespoonful of chopped\r\n  parsley and salt to taste. First, fill a rectangular tin\r\n  mold with cold water to chill and wet the surface; line\r\n  the bottom with waxed paper, then pack in three layers of\r\n  the cheese, putting two or three parallel strips of\r\n  pimiento, fresh or canned, between the layers. Cover with\r\n  waxed paper and set in a cool place until ready to serve;\r\n  then run a knife around the sides and invert the mold. Cut\r\n  in slices and serve on lettuce leaves with French dressing\r\n  and wafers or thin bread-and-butter sandwiches. Minced\r\n  olives may be used instead of the parsley, and chopped\r\n  nuts also may be added.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Cottage Cheese Rolls\r\n\r\n  (To be used like meat rolls.)\r\n\r\n  A large variety of rolls, suitable for serving as the main\r\n  dish at dinner, may be made by combining legumes (beans of\r\n  various kinds, cowpeas, lentils or peas) with cottage\r\n  cheese, and adding bread crumbs to make the mixture thick\r\n  enough to form into a roll. Beans are usually mashed, but\r\n  peas or small Lima beans may be combined whole with bread\r\n  crumbs and cottage cheese, and enough of the liquor in\r\n  which the vegetables have been cooked should be added to\r\n  get the right consistency; or, instead of beans or peas,\r\n  chopped spinach, beet tops or head lettuce may be added.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Boston Roast\r\n\r\n  1 pound can of kidney beans, or equivalent quantity of cooked beans.\r\n  ½ pound of cottage cheese.\r\n  Bread crumbs.\r\n  Salt.\r\n\r\n  Mash the beans or put them through a meat grinder. Add the\r\n  cheese and bread crumbs enough to make the mixture\r\n  sufficiently stiff to be formed into a roll. Bake in a\r\n  moderate oven, basting occasionally with butter or other\r\n  fat, and water. Serve with tomato sauce. This dish may be\r\n  flavored with chopped onions cooked until tender in butter\r\n  or other fat and a very little water.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Pimiento and Cottage Cheese Roast\r\n\r\n  2 cupfuls of cooked Lima beans.\r\n  ¼ pound of cottage cheese.\r\n  Salt.\r\n  3 canned pimientos chopped.\r\n  Bread crumbs.\r\n\r\n  Put the first three ingredients through a meat chopper.\r\n  Mix thoroughly and add bread crumbs until it is stiff\r\n  enough to form into a roll. Brown in the oven, basting\r\n  occasionally with butter or other fat, and water.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Cottage Cheese and Nut Roast\r\n\r\n  1 cupful of cottage cheese.\r\n  1 cupful of chopped English walnuts.\r\n  1 cupful of bread crumbs.\r\n  Salt and pepper.\r\n  2 tablespoonfuls of chopped onion.\r\n  1 tablespoonful of butter.\r\n  Juice of half a lemon.\r\n\r\n  Cook the onion in the butter or other fat and a little\r\n  water until tender. Mix the other ingredients and moisten\r\n  with the water in which the onion has been cooked. Pour\r\n  into a shallow baking dish and brown in the oven.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Cheese Sauce\r\n\r\n  (For use with eggs, milk toast or other dishes.)\r\n\r\n  One cupful of milk, 1 tablespoonful of cottage cheese, 2\r\n  tablespoonfuls of flour, salt and pepper to taste.\r\n\r\n  Thicken the milk with the flour and just before serving\r\n  add the cheese, stirring until it is melted.\r\n\r\n  This sauce may be used in preparing creamed eggs or for\r\n  ordinary milk toast. The quantity of cheese in the recipe\r\n  may be increased, making a sauce suitable for using with\r\n  macaroni or rice.\r\n\r\n\r\n  FOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n  [1] Ont. Exp. Sta.

Cloth, 12mo, $2.00_\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the fact that the milk problem is constantly growing\r\nmore acute in many parts of the United States, no book has thus far\r\nappeared treating, in a brief space, its main aspects and stressing the\r\npractical and economic as well as the sanitary factors involved. The\r\npresent volume is designed to fill this obvious need by providing a\r\nconvenient survey of a perplexing subject--not merely for health\r\nofficials and milk inspectors, but also for dairy-men and city milk\r\ndealers, agricultural authorities, legislators charged with the framing\r\nof milk laws, inquiring consumers and members of organizations engaged\r\nin efforts to secure better milk supplies, physicians, and all others\r\nwho are interested in the understanding and solution of the milk\r\nproblem. The entire work is essentially practical and valuable as a\r\nconstant reference.\r\n\r\nTHE MACMILLAN COMPANY\r\n\r\n  Publishers      64-66 Fifth Avenue      New York\r\n\r\n\r\nCooperation: The Hope of the Consumer\r\n\r\nBY EMERSON P.

D. H. WELD\r\n\r\n  _$1.60_\r\n\r\nThis book aims to set forth the fundamental principles of market\r\ndistribution as applied to the marketing of agricultural products. It\r\nbegins by pointing out the place that marketing occupies in the general\r\nfield of economics, and by applying accepted economic principles to the\r\nmarketing process. It then explains the general organization and methods\r\nof marketing, beginning with marketing at country points, and passes on\r\nto a description of the methods and functions of the various classes of\r\nwholesale dealers. After describing the factors affecting the cost of\r\nmarketing, illustrated by data concerning the marketing of certain\r\nspecific products, a number of special problems are treated, such as\r\nprice quotations, future trading, inspection and grading, public\r\nmarkets, coöperative marketing, etc.\r\n\r\nTHE MACMILLAN COMPANY\r\n\r\n  Publishers      64-66 Fifth Avenue      New York\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  +----------------------------------------------------------------+\r\n  | Transcriber's note:                                            |\r\n  |                                                                |\r\n  | The original text contains a large number of words which occur |\r\n  | in hyphenated and spaced forms with comparable frequency.
