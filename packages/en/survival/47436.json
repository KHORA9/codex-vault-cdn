Silliman signature ]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE\r\n\r\nAMERICAN JOURNAL\r\n\r\nOF\r\n\r\nSCIENCE AND ARTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONDUCTED BY\r\n\r\nPROFESSOR SILLIMAN\r\n\r\nAND\r\n\r\nBENJAMIN SILLIMAN, JR.\r\n\r\n\r\nVOLUME L.\r\n\r\nGENERAL INDEX TO FORTY-NINE VOLUMES.\r\n\r\n\r\nNEW HAVEN:\r\n\r\nPRINTED FOR THE EDITORS BY B. L. HAMLEN, Printer to Yale College.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe project of the American Journal of Science and Arts was first\r\nsuggested by Col. Gibbs, in November, 1817, during an accidental\r\ninterview on board the steamboat Fulton in Long Island Sound.[A] The\r\nAmerican Mineralogical Journal, by the late Dr. Archibald Bruce, (our\r\nearliest purely scientific journal,) which had been begun a few years\r\nbefore, was most favorably received both at home and abroad, but it\r\nnever passed beyond one volume of 270 pages; and as the declining\r\nhealth of Dr. Bruce rendered the prospect of its continuance hopeless,\r\nit was thought that we ought not to lose the advantage already gained,\r\nand that a high demand of duty required that some man devoted to\r\nscience, should undertake to sustain its interests and those of the\r\nconnected arts, in our rising country. Although a different selection\r\nof an editor would have been much preferred, and many reasons, public\r\nand personal, concurred to produce diffidence of success, the arguments\r\nof Col. Gibbs, whose views on subjects of science were entitled to\r\nthe most respectful consideration, and had justly great weight,\r\nbeing pressed with zeal and ability, induced a reluctant assent;\r\nand accordingly, after due consultation with many competent judges,\r\nthe proposals were issued early in 1818, embracing the whole range\r\nof physical science and its applications. The Editor in entering on\r\nthe duty, regarded it as an affair for life, and the thirty years of\r\nexperience which he has now had, have proved that his views of the\r\nexigencies of the service were not erroneous.\r\n\r\nThis Journal first appeared in July, 1818, and in June, 1819, the\r\nfirst volume of four numbers and 448 pages was completed. This scale\r\nof publication, originally deemed sufficient, was found inadequate to\r\nreceive all the communications, and as the receipts proved insufficient\r\nto sustain the expenses, the work, having but three hundred and fifty\r\nsubscribers, was, at the end of the year, abandoned by the publishers.\r\n\r\nAn unprofitable enterprise not being attractive to the trade, ten\r\nmonths elapsed before another arrangement could be carried into\r\neffect, and therefore No. 1 of Vol. ii was not published until April,\r\n1820. The new arrangement was one of mutual responsibility for the\r\nexpenses, but the Editor was constrained nevertheless to pledge his\r\nown personal credit to obtain from a bank the funds necessary to begin\r\nagain, and from this responsibility he was, for a series of years,\r\nseldom released. The single volume per annum being found insufficient\r\nfor the communications, two volumes a year were afterwards published,\r\ncommencing with the second volume.\r\n\r\nAt the conclusion of Vol. x, in February, 1826, the work was again\r\nleft upon the hands of its Editor; all its receipts had been absorbed\r\nby the expenses, and it became necessary now to pay a heavy sum to\r\nthe retiring publisher, as an equivalent for his copies of previous\r\nvolumes, as it was deemed necessary either to control the work entirely\r\nor to abandon it. The Editor was not willing to think of the latter,\r\nespecially as he was encouraged by public approbation, and was cheered\r\nonward in his labors by eminent men both at home and abroad, and he saw\r\ndistinctly that the Journal was rendering service not only to science\r\nand the arts, but to the reputation of his country. He reflected\r\nmoreover that in almost every valuable enterprise perseverance in\r\neffort is necessary to success. He being now sole proprietor, a new\r\narrangement was made for a single year, the publishers being at\r\nliberty, at the end of that time, to retire, and the Editor to resume\r\nthe Journal should he prefer that course.\r\n\r\nThe latter alternative he adopted, taking upon himself the entire\r\nconcern, including both the business and the editorial duties, and of\r\ncourse, all the correspondence and accounts. From that time the work\r\nhas proceeded without interruption, two volumes per annum having been\r\npublished for the last twenty years; and its pecuniary claims ceased to\r\nbe onerous, although its means have never been large.\r\n\r\nForty-nine volumes having been published, ending with Number 100,\r\nOctober, 1845, it was deemed expedient to close the series with a\r\nfiftieth volume, which should contain an ample and well digested INDEX\r\nof the whole. This great labor, vastly more arduous and protracted than\r\nhad been anticipated, is at last accomplished. The strict verification\r\nof every reference in this Index, by actual comparison of the proof\r\nwith the volume and page, has been a labor surpassed only by the\r\ntoil of constructing the Index itself. The printing was commenced\r\nin October, 1846, and so toilsome and time-consuming has been the\r\ncorrection of the proofs, that although the work has gone steadily\r\nforward, without interruption, it is only at this late day completed.\r\nWe may confidently believe that the volume will prove useful, not\r\nonly to those who may possess the whole series, but to all who are\r\nconnected in any way with the arts or sciences; for, whatever the\r\ndepartment, the reader is directed by it to the various memoirs that\r\nhave been published in the Journal on the subject that interests him,\r\nwhether relating to the progress of science, to details of facts in the\r\ndifferent departments of knowledge, or to the various resources of this\r\nand other countries: with such a guide, the entire copies of the work\r\nin public libraries or in those of individuals, become available.\r\n\r\nAs this volume may be consulted by many who have never seen the plan\r\nand prospectus of the Journal with which the first volume began, we\r\nrepublish, on this occasion, both the \"Plan of the Work,\" and also\r\nthose parts of the \"Introductory Remarks\" in which our early views\r\nwere explained. Our readers will thus be able to judge how far we have\r\nfulfilled our engagements, and also how far our prospective views have\r\nbeen realized in the course of our now long experience. They will have\r\nmoreover before them in this Prospectus of 1817, the principles that\r\nare still to guide us in our continued editorial labors.\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"PLAN OF THE WORK.[B]\r\n\r\n    \"This Journal is intended to embrace the circle of the PHYSICAL\r\n    SCIENCES, with their applications to the ARTS, and to every useful\r\n    purpose.\r\n\r\n    It is designed as a deposit for original American communications;\r\n    but will contain also occasional selections from Foreign Journals,\r\n    and notices of the progress of Science in other countries.\r\n\r\n    Within its plan are embraced,\r\n\r\n    NATURAL HISTORY, in its three great departments of MINERALOGY,\r\n    BOTANY and ZOOLOGY:--\r\n\r\n    CHEMISTRY and NATURAL PHILOSOPHY, in their various branches; and\r\n    MATHEMATICS, pure and mixed.\r\n\r\n    It will be a leading object to illustrate AMERICAN NATURAL HISTORY,\r\n    and especially our MINERALOGY and GEOLOGY.\r\n\r\n    The APPLICATIONS of these sciences are obviously as numerous as\r\n    physical arts and physical wants; for no one of these arts or wants\r\n    can be named which is not connected with them.\r\n\r\n    While SCIENCE will be cherished _for its own sake_, and with a due\r\n    respect for its own inherent dignity; it will also be employed as\r\n    the handmaid to the Arts. Its numerous applications to AGRICULTURE,\r\n    the earliest and most important of them; to our MANUFACTURES both\r\n    mechanical and chemical; and to our DOMESTIC ECONOMY, will be\r\n    carefully sought out, and faithfully made.\r\n\r\n    It is also within the design of this Journal to receive\r\n    communications on MUSIC, SCULPTURE, ENGRAVING, PAINTING, and\r\n    generally on the fine and liberal, as well as useful arts:--\r\n\r\n    On Military and Civil Engineering, and the art of Navigation:--\r\n\r\n    Notices, Reviews and Analyses of new scientific works, and of new\r\n    Inventions, and Specifications of Patents:--\r\n\r\n    Bibliographical and Obituary Notices of scientific men; essays on\r\n    Comparative Anatomy and Physiology, and generally on such other\r\n    branches of medicine as depend on scientific principles:--\r\n\r\n    Meteorological Registers, and Reports of Agricultural Experiments:\r\n    and we would leave room also for interesting miscellaneous things,\r\n    not exactly included under either of the above heads.\r\n\r\n    Communications are respectfully solicited from men of science, and\r\n    from men versed in the practical arts.\r\n\r\n    Learned Societies are invited to make this Journal, occasionally,\r\n    the vehicle of their communications to the public.\r\n\r\n    The Editor will not hold himself responsible for the sentiments and\r\n    opinions advanced by his correspondents; but he will consider it as\r\n    an allowed liberty to make slight verbal alterations, where errors\r\n    may be presumed to have arisen from inadvertency.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"INTRODUCTORY REMARKS.\r\n\r\n    \"The age in which we live is not less distinguished by a vigorous\r\n    and successful cultivation of physical science, than by its\r\n    numerous and important applications to the practical arts, and to\r\n    the common purposes of life.\r\n\r\n    \"In every enlightened country, men illustrious for talent, worth,\r\n    and knowledge, are ardently engaged in enlarging the boundaries of\r\n    natural science; and the history of their labors and discoveries is\r\n    communicated to the world chiefly through the medium of Scientific\r\n    Journals. The utility of such Journals has thus become generally\r\n    evident; they are the heralds of science; they proclaim its toils\r\n    and its achievements; they demonstrate its intimate connexion\r\n    as well with the comfort, as with the intellectual and moral\r\n    improvement of our species; and they often procure for it enviable\r\n    honors and substantial rewards.\r\n\r\n    \"In England, the interests of science have been, for a series of\r\n    years, greatly promoted by the excellent Journals of Tilloch and\r\n    Nicholson; and for the loss of the latter, the scientific world has\r\n    been fully compensated by Dr. Thomson's Annals of Philosophy, and\r\n    by the Journal of Science and the Arts, both published in London.\r\n\r\n    \"In France, the Annales de Chimie et de Physique, the Journal des\r\n    Mines, the Journal de Physique, &c. have long enjoyed a high and\r\n    deserved reputation. Indeed, there are few countries in Europe\r\n    which do not produce some similar publication; not to mention the\r\n    transactions of learned societies and numerous medical journals.\r\n\r\n    \"From these sources _our_ country reaps, and will long continue\r\n    to reap, an abundant harvest of information: and if the light of\r\n    science, as well as of day, springs from the east, we will welcome\r\n    the rays of both; nor should national pride induce us to reject so\r\n    rich an offering.\r\n\r\n    \"But can we do nothing in return?\r\n\r\n    \"In a general diffusion of useful information through the various\r\n    classes of society, in activity of intellect, and fertility of\r\n    resource and invention, producing a highly intelligent population,\r\n    we have no reason to shrink from a comparison with any country.\r\n    But the devoted cultivators of science in the United States,\r\n    are comparatively few; they are, however, rapidly increasing in\r\n    number. Among them are persons distinguished for their capacity\r\n    and attainments, and, notwithstanding the local feelings nourished\r\n    by our state sovereignties, and the rival claims of several of\r\n    our larger cities, there is evidently a predisposition towards a\r\n    concentration of effort, from which we may hope for the happiest\r\n    results, with regard to the advancement of both the science and\r\n    reputation of our country.\r\n\r\n    \"Is it not, therefore, desirable to furnish some rallying point,\r\n    some object sufficiently interesting to be nurtured by common\r\n    efforts, and thus to become the basis of an enduring, common\r\n    interest? To produce these efforts, and to excite this interest,\r\n    nothing, perhaps, bids fairer than a SCIENTIFIC JOURNAL.\r\n\r\n    \"No one, it is presumed, will doubt that a Journal devoted to\r\n    science, and embracing a sphere sufficiently extensive to allure\r\n    to its support the principal scientific men of our country, is\r\n    greatly needed; if cordially supported, it will be successful, and\r\n    if successful, it will be a great public benefit.\r\n\r\n    \"Even a failure, in so good a cause, (unless it should arise from\r\n    incapacity or unfaithfulness,) cannot be regarded as dishonorable.\r\n    It may prove only that the attempt was _premature_, and that our\r\n    country is not yet ripe for such an undertaking; for _without the\r\n    efficient support of talent, knowledge_, and _money, it cannot long\r\n    proceed_. No editor can hope to carry forward such a work without\r\n    the active aid of scientific and practical men; but, at the same\r\n    time, the public have a right to expect that he will not be sparing\r\n    of his own labor, and that his work shall be generally marked by\r\n    the impress of his own hand. To this extent the editor cheerfully\r\n    acknowledges his obligations to the public; and it will be his\r\n    endeavor faithfully to redeem his pledge.\r\n\r\n    \"Most of the periodical works of our country have been short-lived.\r\n    _This_, also, _may_ perish in its infancy; and if any degree\r\n    of confidence is cherished that it will attain a maturer age,\r\n    it is derived from the obvious and intrinsic importance of the\r\n    undertaking; from its being built upon permanent and momentous\r\n    national interests; from the evidence of a decided approbation\r\n    of the design, on the part of gentlemen of the first eminence,\r\n    obtained in the progress of an extensive correspondence; from\r\n    assurances of support, in the way of contributions, from men of\r\n    ability in many sections of the union; and from the existence of\r\n    _such a crisis_ in the affairs of this country and of the world, as\r\n    appears peculiarly auspicious to the success of every wise and good\r\n    undertaking.\r\n\r\n    \"As regards the subjects of the contemplated work, it is not in\r\n    our power to do much in the department of the natural history of\r\n    this country. Our Zoology has been more fully investigated than our\r\n    mineralogy and botany; but neither department is in danger of being\r\n    exhausted. The interesting travels of Lewis and Clark have recently\r\n    brought to our knowledge several plants and animals before unknown.\r\n    Foreign naturalists are frequently exploring our territory; and,\r\n    for the most part, convey to Europe the fruits of their researches,\r\n    while but a small part of our own productions is examined and\r\n    described by Americans: certainly, this is little to our credit,\r\n    and still less to our advantage. Honorable exceptions to the truth\r\n    of this remark are furnished by the exertions of some gentlemen in\r\n    our principal cities, and in various other parts of the Union.\r\n\r\n    \"Our botany, it is true, has been extensively and successfully\r\n    investigated; but this field is still _rich_, and rewards every\r\n    new research with some interesting discovery. Our mineralogy,\r\n    however, is a treasure but just opened. That both science and art\r\n    may expect much advantage from this source, is sufficiently evinced\r\n    by the success which has crowned the active efforts of a few\r\n    ardent cultivators of this science: several new species have been\r\n    added to it in this country; great numbers of American localities\r\n    of minerals discovered, and interesting additions made to our\r\n    materials, for the useful and ornamental arts.\r\n\r\n    \"Mineralogy is most intimately connected with our arts, and\r\n    especially with agriculture. Such are the disguises worn by many\r\n    most useful mineral substances, that an unskilful observer is\r\n    liable to pass a thing by, as worthless, which, if better informed,\r\n    he would seize with avidity; and, still more frequently, a\r\n    worthless substance, clothed perhaps in a brilliant and attractive\r\n    exterior, excites hopes altogether delusive, and induces expense,\r\n    without a possibility of remuneration. A diffusion of correct\r\n    knowledge on this subject is the only adequate remedy for either\r\n    evil.\r\n\r\n    \"Our geology, also, presents a most interesting field of inquiry.\r\n    A grand outline has recently been drawn by Mr. Maclure, with a\r\n    masterly hand, and with a vast extent of personal observation and\r\n    labor: but to fill up the detail, both observation and labor still\r\n    more extensive are demanded; nor can the object be effected till\r\n    more good geologists are formed, and distributed over our extensive\r\n    territory.\r\n\r\n    \"To account for the formation and changes of our globe, by\r\n    excursions of the imagination, often splendid and imposing, but\r\n    usually visionary, and almost always baseless, was, till within\r\n    half a century, the business of geological speculations; but this\r\n    research has now assumed a more sober character; the science of\r\n    geology has been reared upon numerous and accurate observations\r\n    of _facts_; and standing thus upon the basis of induction, it\r\n    is entitled to a rank among those sciences which Lord Bacon's\r\n    Philosophy has contributed to create.\r\n\r\n    \"The outlines of American geology appear to be particularly grand,\r\n    simple, and instructive; and a knowledge of the important facts,\r\n    and general principles of this science, is of vast practical use,\r\n    as regards the interests of agriculture, and the research for\r\n    useful minerals. Geological and mineralogical descriptions, and\r\n    maps of particular states and districts, are very much needed in\r\n    the United States; and to excite a spirit to furnish them will form\r\n    one leading object of the contemplated journal.\r\n\r\n    \"The science of natural philosophy, with its powerful auxiliary\r\n    mathematics, and the science of chemistry, the twin sister of\r\n    natural philosophy, are of incalculable importance to this country.\r\n    A volume would not suffice to trace their applications, and to\r\n    enumerate the instances of their utility.\r\n\r\n    \"As one which may be allowed to stand, _instar omnium_, we may\r\n    mention the steam engine; that legitimate child of physical and\r\n    chemical science--at once more powerful than the united force\r\n    of the strongest and largest animals, and more manageable than\r\n    the smallest and gentlest; raising from the bowels of the earth\r\n    the massy treasures of its mines, drawing up rivers from their\r\n    channels, and pouring them, in streams of life, into the bosom\r\n    of cities; and, above all, propelling against the currents, the\r\n    winds, and the waves, of the ocean, those stupendous vessels, which\r\n    combine speed with certainty, and establish upon the bosom of the\r\n    deep the luxuries and accommodations of the land.\r\n\r\n    \"The successful execution of this magnificent design was first\r\n    effected by Fulton and witnessed upon the waters of the Hudson, but\r\n    is now imitated in almost every civilized country; and it remains\r\n    to be seen whether steam will be applied in war.\r\n\r\n    \"The mechanical inventions of this country are numerous; many of\r\n    them are ingenious, and some are highly important. In no way can\r\n    a knowledge of them be so readily and extensively diffused as in\r\n    a scientific journal. To this object, therefore, a part of our\r\n    labors (should there be a call for it) will be devoted, and every\r\n    necessary aid will be given by plates and descriptions.\r\n\r\n    \"Science and art mutually assist each other; the arts furnish facts\r\n    and materials to science, and science illuminates the path of the\r\n    arts.\r\n\r\n    \"Geometry, and mathematics both pure and mixed, can never cease\r\n    to be interesting and important to man, as long as the relations\r\n    of quantity shall exist, as long as ships shall traverse the\r\n    ocean, as long as man shall measure the surface or heights of the\r\n    earth on which he lives, or calculate the distances and examine\r\n    the relations of the planets and stars; and as long as the iron\r\n    reign of war shall demand the discharge of projectiles, or the\r\n    construction of complicated defenses.\r\n\r\n    \"In a word, the whole circle of physical science is directly\r\n    applicable to human wants, and constantly holds out a light to the\r\n    practical arts; it thus polishes and benefits society, and every\r\n    where demonstrates both supreme intelligence, and harmony and\r\n    beneficence of design in the CREATOR.\"\r\n\r\nSuch was the pledge which, on entering upon our editorial labors in\r\n1818, we gave to the public, and such were the views which we then\r\nentertained, regarding science and the arts as connected with the\r\ninterests and honor of our country and of mankind. In the retrospect,\r\nwe realize a sober but grateful feeling of satisfaction, in having, to\r\nthe extent of our power, discharged these self-imposed obligations;\r\nthis feeling is chastened also by a deep sense of gratitude, first,\r\nto God for life and power continued for so high a purpose; and next,\r\nto our noble band of contributors, whose labors are recorded in half\r\na century of volumes, and in more than a quarter of a century of\r\nyears. We need not conceal our conviction, that the views expressed in\r\nthese \"Introductory Remarks,\" have been fully sustained by our fellow\r\nlaborers.\r\n\r\nShould we appear to take higher ground than becomes us, we find our\r\nvindication in the fact, that we have heralded chiefly the doings\r\nand the fame of others. The work has indeed borne throughout \"the\r\nimpress\" of editorial unity of design, and much that has flowed from\r\none pen, and not a little from the pens of others, has been without\r\na name. The materials for the pile, have however been selected and\r\nbrought in, chiefly by other hands, and if the monument which has\r\nbeen reared should prove to be \"_ære perennius_,\" the honor is not\r\nthe sole property of the architect; those who have quarried, hewn and\r\npolished the granite and the marble, are fully entitled to the enduring\r\nrecord of their names already deeply cut into the massy blocks, which\r\nthemselves have furnished.\r\n\r\nIf a retrospective survey of the labors of thirty years, on this\r\noccasion, has rekindled a degree of enthusiasm, it is the natural\r\nresult of an examination of all our volumes, from the contents of which\r\nwe have endeavored to make out a summary both of the laborers and their\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nWe find that there have been about 600 contributors of original matter\r\nto the Journal, and we have the unexpected satisfaction of believing\r\nthat probably five-sixths of them are still living; for we are not\r\ncertain that more than fifty are among the dead; of perhaps fifty more\r\nwe are without information, and if that additional number is to be\r\nenrolled among the \"stelligeri,\" we have still 500 remaining. Among\r\nthem are not a few of the veterans with whom we began our career,\r\nand several of these are still active contributors. Shall we then\r\nconclude that the peaceful pursuits of knowledge are favorable to long\r\nlife? This we think is, _cæteris paribus_, certainly true: but in the\r\npresent instance, another reason can be assigned for the large amount\r\nof survivorship. As the Journal has advanced and death has removed\r\nits scientific contributors, younger men and men still younger, have\r\nrecruited the ranks, and volunteers have enlisted in numbers constantly\r\nincreasing, so that the flower of the host are now in the morning and\r\nmeridian of life.\r\n\r\nWe have been constantly advancing, like a traveller from the\r\nequinoctial towards the colder zones,--as we have increased our\r\nlatitude, stars have set and new stars have risen, while a few\r\nplanetary orbs visible in every zone, have continued to cheer us on our\r\ncourse.\r\n\r\nThe number of articles, almost exclusively original, contained in the\r\nJournal is about 1800, and the Index will show how many have been\r\ncontributed by each individual; we have doubtless included in this\r\nnumber _some few_ articles republished from foreign Journals--but\r\nwe think they are even more than counterbalanced by original\r\ncommunications without a name and by editorial articles, both of which\r\nhave been generally omitted in the enumeration.\r\n\r\nOf smaller articles and notices in the Miscellany, we have not made\r\nany enumeration, but they evidently are more numerous than the regular\r\narticles, and we presume that they may amount to at least 2500.\r\n\r\nOf party, either in politics or religion, there is no trace in our\r\nwork; of personalities there are none, except those that relate\r\nto priority of claims or other rights of individuals. Of these\r\nvindications the number is not great, and we could heartily have wished\r\nthat there had been no occasion for any.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDuring twenty years from the inception of this Journal, the editor\r\nlabored alone, although overtures for editorial coöperation had been\r\nmade to him by gentlemen commanding his confidence and esteem, and\r\nwho would personally have been very acceptable. It was, however, his\r\nopinion that the unity of purpose and action so essential to the\r\nsuccess of such a work were best secured by _individuality_; but he\r\nmade every effort, and not without success, to conciliate the good\r\nwill and to secure the assistance of gentlemen eminent in particular\r\ndepartments of knowledge. On the title page of No. 1, Vol. xxxiv,\r\npublished in July, 1838, a new name is introduced: the individual to\r\nwhom it belongs having been for several years more or less concerned\r\nin the management of the Journal, and from his education, position,\r\npursuits and taste, as well as from affinity, being almost identified\r\nwith the editor, he seemed to be quite a natural ally, and his adoption\r\ninto the editorship was scarcely a violation of individual unity. His\r\nassistance has proved to be very important:--his near relation to the\r\nsenior editor prevents him from saying more, while justice does not\r\npermit him to say less.\r\n\r\nIt may be interesting to our readers to know something of the patronage\r\nof the Journal. It has never reached one thousand paying subscribers,\r\nand has rarely exceeded seven or eight hundred--for many years it\r\nfluctuated between six and seven hundred.\r\n\r\nIt has been far from paying a reasonable editorial compensation; often\r\nit has paid nothing, and at present it does little more than pay its\r\nbills. The number of engravings and the extra labor in printer's\r\ncomposition, cause it to be an expensive work, while its patronage is\r\nlimited.\r\n\r\nIt has a large gratuitous distribution, both at home and abroad, and\r\nan extensive good-will exchange with works often having no particular\r\nbearing upon its peculiar objects. It has incurred a heavy extra\r\nexpenditure in reprinting exhausted numbers, for the purpose of\r\nfurnishing entire sets of the work. No application for an entire set\r\nhas ever yet been disappointed, and complete sets of the volumes are\r\nto be found in many institutions and in the hands of many individuals,\r\nboth in Europe and in the United States. Entire sets have often been\r\npresented gratuitously to our infant colleges and to scientific\r\ninstitutions and distinguished individuals in Europe. A few remain on\r\nhand, and it is our intention to furnish them as long as we can afford\r\nto republish, or can repurchase numbers that have run out.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe series of volumes must ever form a work of permanent interest on\r\naccount of its exhibiting the progress of American science during the\r\nlong period which it covers. Comparing 1817[C] with 1847, we mark on\r\nthis subject a very gratifying change. The cultivators of science in\r\nthe United States were then few--now they are numerous. Societies\r\nand associations of various names, for the cultivation of natural\r\nhistory, have been instituted in very many of our cities and towns,\r\nand several of them have been active and efficient in making original\r\nobservations and forming collections. The American Philosophical\r\nSociety at Philadelphia, the American Academy of Arts and Sciences\r\nat Boston, and the Academy of Natural Sciences also at Philadelphia,\r\nnumbered distinguished names among their members, and had published\r\nvaluable volumes of Transactions before our publication began. The\r\nConnecticut Academy of Arts and Sciences had also published a single\r\nvolume as early as 1813. Since that time the Lyceum of Natural History\r\nof New York, the Boston Society of Natural History, the Albany\r\nInstitute, and the Maryland Academy of Sciences have stood prominent\r\namong associations of a like nature, and their memoirs now constitute\r\nan important item in our scientific history. Other associations for the\r\ndepartments of history and ethnography have also published memoirs;\r\nand we must not omit to mention the American Geological Society, and\r\nthe Geological Society of Pennsylvania, which has issued one valuable\r\nvolume.\r\n\r\nOf scientific collections we may say, that in the Institution from\r\nwhich we date these remarks, going back only fourteen years from the\r\nissuing of our first number, the entire mineralogical and geological\r\ncollection of the college was transported to Philadelphia in one small\r\nbox, and there, for lack of information elsewhere, the specimens were\r\nnamed by the late Dr. Adam Seybert, then fresh from the celebrated\r\nschool of Werner at Freiburg in Germany, perhaps the only man then in\r\nthis country who could be regarded as a mineralogist scientifically\r\ntrained. Now, mineralogy and geology are familiar to our legislators\r\nand our youth; and the institution which sent forth its little box\r\nof unknown mineral treasures, unfolds to its pupils and the world a\r\nmagnificent collection not surpassed, if equalled, in the United States.\r\n\r\nBoston, which at our earliest date presented only the limited\r\ncollection of the Linnæan Society, now opens to the student a rich\r\nand beautiful museum of natural history; and Harvard University at\r\nCambridge has a fine botanical garden under an able and zealous\r\nbotanist--a well furnished and successful observatory, and a rich\r\ncollection of minerals and fossils, including a skeleton of the\r\nMastodon, which is rivalled only by the specimen of unexampled\r\nmagnitude and perfection, in the private museum of Dr. John C. Warren\r\nin Boston.\r\n\r\nPhiladelphia may also boast of her cabinets of natural history, public\r\nand private: and one of the noblest collections of birds in the\r\nworld,[D] bestowed on his country by Mr. Wilson of Delaware, has been,\r\nwithin a few months, added to the valuable collections of the Academy\r\nof Natural Sciences at that place.\r\n\r\nWhen we began our Journal, not one of the States had been surveyed in\r\nrelation to its geology and natural history; now those that have not\r\nbeen explored are few in number. State collections and a United States\r\nMuseum hold forth many allurements to the young naturalist, as well as\r\nto the archæologist and the student of his own race. The late Exploring\r\nExpedition with the National Institute, has enriched the capital\r\nwith treasures rarely equalled in any country, and the Smithsonian\r\nInstitution recently organized at Washington, is about to begin its\r\nlabors for the increase and diffusion of knowledge among men.\r\n\r\nIt must not be forgotten that the American Association of Geologists\r\nand Naturalists--composed of individuals assembled from widely separate\r\nportions of the Union--by the seven sessions which it has held, and by\r\nits rich volume of reports, has produced a concentration and harmony\r\nof effort which promise happy results, especially as, like the British\r\nAssociation, it visits different towns and cities in its annual\r\nprogress.\r\n\r\nAstronomy now lifts its exploring tubes from the observatories of many\r\nof our institutions. Even the Ohio, which within the memory of the\r\noldest living men, rolled along its dark waters through interminable\r\nforests, or received the stains of blood from deadly Indian warfare,\r\nnow beholds on one of its most beautiful hills, and near its splendid\r\ncity, a permanent observatory with a noble telescope sweeping the\r\nheavens, by the hand of a zealous and gifted observer. At Washington\r\nalso, under the powerful patronage of the general government, an\r\nexcellent observatory has been established, and is furnished with\r\nsuperior instruments, under the direction of a vigilant and well\r\ninstructed astronomer--seconded by able and zealous assistants.\r\n\r\nHere also (in Yale College) successful observations have been made with\r\ngood instruments, although no permanent building has been erected for\r\nan Observatory.\r\n\r\nWe only give single examples by way of illustration, for the history of\r\nthe progress of science in the United States, and of institutions for\r\nits promotion, during the present generation, would demand a volume.\r\nIt is enough for our purpose that science is understood and valued,\r\nand the right methods of prosecuting it are known, and the time is at\r\nhand when its moral and intellectual uses will be as obvious as its\r\nphysical applications. Nor is it to be forgotten that we have awakened\r\nan European interest in our researches: general science has been\r\nillustrated by treasures of facts drawn from this country, and our\r\ndiscoveries are eagerly sought for and published abroad.\r\n\r\nWhile with our co-workers[E] in many parts of our broad land, we\r\nrejoice in this auspicious change, we are far from arrogating it to\r\nourselves. Multiplied labors of many hands have produced the great\r\nresult. In the place which we have occupied, we have persevered despite\r\nof all discouragements, and may, with our numerous coadjutors, claim\r\nsome share in the honors of the day. We do not say that our work might\r\nnot have been better done--but we may declare with truth that we have\r\ndone all in our power, and it is something to have excited many others\r\nto effort and to have chronicled their deeds in our annals. Let those\r\nthat follow us labor with the like zeal and perseverance, and the\r\ngood cause will continue to advance and prosper. It is the cause of\r\ntruth--science is only embodied and systematized truth, and in the\r\nbeautiful conception of our noble Agassiz--\"_it tells the thoughts of\r\nGod_.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAlthough we are writing a preface to our first series already closed,\r\nwe may, without impropriety, say something of the Second Series now in\r\nsuccessful progress. It began on the first of January, 1846; instead\r\nof being quarterly like the First Series, it appears once in two\r\nmonths--six times in a year, giving two volumes of 450 pages each.\r\nIn this Series, the name of a third editor appears upon the title\r\npage, and the remarks which have been already made are, in their\r\nspirit and almost in the letter, applicable in the present instance.\r\nThe _unity_ is still preserved, and both counsel and action--favored\r\nby juxta-position and constant intercourse--are almost as if one\r\nindividual presided alone. It will be perceived, therefore, that we\r\nhave not departed from the principle which has governed us from the\r\nbeginning, and when our mantle shall fall, there are those at hand who\r\nmay, if it be worth the effort, arrest it in its descent and wear it\r\nmore worthily than we have done.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe portrait prefixed to this volume was engraved for a very different\r\npurpose and for others than the patrons of this Journal. It has been\r\nsuggested by friends, whose judgment we are accustomed to respect, that\r\nit ought to find a place here, since it is regarded as an authentic,\r\nalthough, perhaps, a rather austere resemblance. In yielding to this\r\nsuggestion, it may be sufficient to quote the sentiment of Cowper on a\r\nsimilar occasion, who remarked--\"that after a man has, for many years,\r\nturned his mind _inside out_ before the world, it is only affectation\r\nto attempt to hide his face.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn tracing back the associations of many gone-by years, a host of\r\nthoughts rush in, and pensive remembrance of the dead who have labored\r\nwith us casts deep shadows into the vista through which we view the\r\npast.\r\n\r\nAnticipation of the hour of discharge, when our summons shall arrive,\r\ngives sobriety to thought and checks the confidence which health and\r\ncontinued power to act might naturally inspire, were we not reproved,\r\nalmost every day, by the death of some coeval, co-worker, companion,\r\nfriend or patron. This very hour is saddened by such an event,--but\r\nwe will continue to labor on, and strive to be found at our post of\r\nduty, until there is nothing more for us to do; trusting our hopes for\r\na future life in the hands of him who placed us in the midst of the\r\nsplendid garniture of this lower world, and who has made not less ample\r\nprovision for another and a better.\r\n\r\n\r\nYale College, April 19, 1847.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXPLANATIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nNames of authors and subjects are arranged together alphabetically.\r\n\r\nReferences to species of animals described or noticed in the Journal,\r\nthough to some extent distributed through the Index, are systematically\r\ncatalogued under the word _Zoology_.

Meteorological Journal of Pres. Stiles, shows\r\nthat the words \"_extreme cold_\" were marked on the thermometer (which\r\nwas probably Hauksbee's) as comprehending a region, on the scale,\r\nof 20° H., viz. from 85° to 105°; 100° H. being equal to 0° Fahr.\r\nImmediately above this region of _extreme cold_, is a region of 20°\r\nmarked \"_frost_,\" extending from 65° to 85° H. (65° H. being equal to\r\n+32° Fahr.) The cold at New Haven ascertained from other sources was,\r\nDec. 31, 1766, -1° F., Jan. 1, 1767, -8-1/2 F., Jan. 2, -9-3/4 F.,\r\nwhich numbers correspond very nearly with the statements in _extreme\r\ncold_, when explained on the principles above mentioned. The cold of\r\nJan. 5, 1835, at New Haven, still appears to be more intense than any\r\npreviously recorded here.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCORRIGENDA TO VOL. XXXII.\r\n\r\n\r\n_East Bridgewater Meteorite._--I have examined the East Bridgewater,\r\nMass., Meteorite referred to in vol. xxxii, p. 395, of this Journal,\r\nand find the specimens which were collected to be nothing more than\r\nold slag from an iron-furnace, which had been spread over the field in\r\nformer times. Some rounded balls of these had been washed up during\r\nthe severe thunder shower during which the fall was believed to have\r\noccurred. One of the specimens submitted to my inspection was from the\r\nidentical parcel collected by the lad with whom the report originated.\r\nIts surface was much invested, (and its substance partially penetrated)\r\nwith rootlets of grasses!\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES U.
