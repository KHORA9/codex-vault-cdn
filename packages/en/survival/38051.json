The world is full of\r\nbulletins of experiment stations, of articles in periodicals and of\r\ngeneral books on vegetables which include discussion of tomatoes.\r\n\r\nAn incomplete set of tomato bulletins includes over 350 documents.\r\nMany of these are no longer available. Many are of no great value\r\nbut contribute this or that small item.\r\n\r\nThe task of a book like this is to offer between two covers, a\r\nsummary of what seem the most significant facts and opinions about\r\nthe third most important vegetable crop in the United States.\r\n\r\nThe tomato is one of the most rewarding crops for the home garden. A\r\nlittle space yields heavily, from half a peck to a peck per plant\r\nwithout difficulty. It grows well practically everywhere in the\r\nStates, affording high nutritional values whether used fresh or\r\ncanned. And people do like tomatoes, whether as salad, cooked\r\nvegetable, or condiment.\r\n\r\nCompetition among growers and among districts makes three elements\r\nnecessary for commercial success:--quality in the goods, economy in\r\nproduction, and effectiveness in marketing.\r\n\r\nThe grower must know his plant, what it is like and how it behaves\r\nunder various conditions and treatments. Then, he needs an\r\nunderstanding of the economic factors that surround his enterprise.\r\n\r\nConditions in various sections and production for various purposes\r\nare so diverse that dogmatic statement and general advice are\r\nprecluded. The aim is rather by means of available information to\r\nhelp the reader to an understanding that will enable him to answer\r\nhis own questions for his own conditions and this far better than\r\nany broad prescription could possibly do. Principles, possible\r\npractices and examples of field programs are offered as guides for\r\nself-help for home, school, hobby as well as commercial production.\r\n\r\nA person who studies on this basis will not be thwarted by a sudden\r\nshift of weather or market but will have at hand the necessary facts\r\nand ideas to adjust his plan to changed conditions.\r\n\r\nNo attempt has been made toward complete citation of reference.\r\nThose given will lead to others making possible a full survey of the\r\nextensive literature.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n      The Tomato\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n      I\r\n\r\n      THE TOMATO IS A GREAT FOOD AND CROP PLANT\r\n\r\n\r\nVegetable, Fruit or Berry,--what is the tomato? A standard query\r\nthis is and many an argument has raged about it. The answer is easy.\r\nIt is all three. By culture and use, it is a vegetable; botanically\r\nit is a fruit and among the fruits, it is a berry being indehiscent\r\n(non-shedding), pulpy, with one or more seeds that are not stones.\r\nAnd they say the tomato is more truly a berry than the raspberry.\r\n\r\nBut that doesn't make much difference. The thing that matters is\r\nthat people like the tomato. It is easy to grow and nearly every\r\nhome garden has it. It is good to look upon--shapely, colorful and\r\nof glossy sheen. A trained single stem plant with ripening fruit is\r\na genuine ornament in the garden. It is most gratifying to the\r\npalate, fresh or cooked; soft and grainy, smooth and juicy in\r\ntexture, sweet and tart and with an appealing flavor all of its own\r\nthat few fail to relish. As juice or cocktail, adding color and\r\nflavor to soup, as condiment or as side dish with the entree, as\r\nsalad freshly sliced or in jell, it is welcome with almost every\r\ncourse and some ingenious chef or, more likely, some clever\r\nhousewife will, one of these days, fashion from it the dessert\r\nsupreme.\r\n\r\nNor have we exhausted the list of forms in which the tomato may be\r\nserved. In addition to its simplest cooked form, stewed or turned\r\nhot from the can, it may also be baked, stuffed or not, or it may be\r\nescalloped and cooked with rice, spaghetti or other foods. Fried,\r\nbefore fully ripe, and served with brown gravy, it is most popular\r\nin many a home.\r\n\r\nKetchup or catsup is one of our most widely used condiments and\r\nchili sauce many like even better. Green tomato pickles, chow chow,\r\npiccalilli carry the piquant tang of the tomato to enliven the\r\nwinter table. And tomato juice, plain or dressed up with spices,\r\nvinegar or lemon juice has become a great staple of our groceries, a\r\nstandard send-off for any meal from breakfast snatched on the\r\nmorning sprint to work on through to the most elaborate of\r\nbanquets.\r\n\r\nThe tomato, by reason of its natural acidity, is readily sterilized\r\nand so can be preserved easily in glass or tin. It ranks first among\r\nthe \"big three\" canned vegetables; the other two being sweet corn\r\nand peas. By far the great bulk that goes to the factory is put up\r\nwith the addition of nothing more than salt. In addition to the\r\ncondiments, puree and paste are manufactured in commercial\r\nquantities. The Italians dry tomatoes extensively in the sun,\r\nslicing the fruits, and later flavoring them to taste for various\r\nwinter uses.\r\n\r\nThough the tomato was not recognized as a valuable food until about\r\na century ago, its merit is now universally accepted. Bob Adams used\r\nto call it \"the poor man's orange\" for it is rich in vitamins and in\r\nmalic and citric acid, possessing besides, a fine appetizing flavor\r\nwhich is as truly a value in nutrition as it is a pleasure.\r\n\r\nActually, the tomato is mostly water, of rather low protein and\r\ncarbohydrate content but this does not detract, for other foods are\r\ndependable for these staples of nutrition and most of us eat too\r\nmuch of them.\r\n\r\nThe tomato is a youngster among the vegetables. In contrast to the\r\nonion of Egyptian lore and the cucumber reputed to have been used\r\nin Western Asia many centuries ago, the tomato is not reported\r\nuntil the herbalists of the 16th century recorded its culture in\r\nItaly and England--but with little of the esteem now accorded. The\r\nname seems to be of Aztec origin and two distinct wild forms--one\r\ncorresponding to our cherry or currant varieties and the other to\r\nour larger, flatter, less regular fruits of many cells,--are to be\r\nfound wild in Latin America. Its American origin is generally\r\naccepted.\r\n\r\nCommercially, the tomato is a great crop. Among the vegetables, it\r\nis outranked only by the potato and the sweet potato.\r\n\r\nThe following table gives a few figures on the tomato crop:\r\n\r\n  ======================================================================\r\n                        |         |   _Acres_   |       _Value_\r\n                        |         | _Thousands_ |  _Million dollars_\r\n                        |_1929-38_+-------------+---------+------+------\r\n                        |_Average_|      |      |_1929-38_|      |\r\n                        |         |_1939_|_1940_|_Average_|_1939_|_1940_\r\n  ----------------------+---------+------+------+---------+------+------\r\n  U.S. for canning      |   369   |  358 |  386 |   19    |  24  |  24\r\n       for fresh market |   177   |  210 |  204 |   24    |  34  |  29\r\n                        +---------+------+------+---------+------+------\r\n            Total       |   546   |  568 |  590 |   43    |  58  |  53\r\n  ----------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nAverage yield for market is about 116 bushels per acre and the\r\naverage price $1.26 per bushel. The government reckons a bushel at\r\n53 pounds, or about 38 bushels per ton.\r\n\r\nThe average cannery yield for 1929-38 was 4.15 tons; for 1939, 5.58\r\ntons; and 1940, 5.39 tons. This shows a material increase. The\r\naverage cannery price for 1929-38 was $12.54 per ton. Yields by\r\nstates varied widely in 1940 from 2.7 tons per acre in Arkansas with\r\nIndiana at 5.5 to 7.5 in California. In northeastern states, it is\r\nconsidered that about a seven ton yield is necessary for the farmer\r\nto break even. In New York, it costs about $60.00 to grow an acre of\r\ntomatoes to first picking. With a good yield, picking and delivery\r\ncosts about $3.00 a ton.\r\n\r\nLeading market states are Texas, 40,000 acres; Florida, 31,000 and\r\nCalifornia, 22,000. Tomatoes are grown in a very large number of\r\nstates--23 or 24 states showing 1,000 acres or more for market.\r\n\r\nLeading cannery states are Indiana, 74,000 acres; California,\r\n52,000; Maryland, 51,000; and New Jersey, 33,000. California, also\r\nPennsylvania and Ohio have shown recent large gains.\r\n\r\nLarge quantities grown in town and country home gardens are not\r\nincluded in these figures and probably also many grown on small\r\nscale for market.\r\n\r\nAfter all, however, the United States Department of Agriculture\r\nestimated per capita consumption of fresh tomatoes at 17.7 pounds,\r\nabout one medium sized fruit per week per person. Consumption of\r\ncanned tomatoes is less than a third of the fresh consumption. These\r\nfigures include estimates for rural and urban home gardens. So, we\r\ncan hardly be said to be gluttons for tomatoes nor even to meet a\r\nfair health standard, even considering all vegetables together.\r\nAfter all, it does not have to be tomatoes even though their high\r\nnutritional value is recognized.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 1.--The tomato is the leader among greenhouse\r\nvegetables.]\r\n\r\nIn commercial greenhouses, the tomato has replaced lettuce as the\r\nprincipal crop and it is likely to remain an important under-glass\r\ncrop until such time as the South finds practical means of getting\r\nit to market with first-class quality--perhaps, harvesting the fruit\r\nwhen it first shows color.\r\n\r\n\r\n      Solution Culture\r\n\r\nThe tomato has been widely used in experiments in solution-culture\r\nof plants, sometimes called \"hydroponics.\" The method has been in\r\nuse for decades for research purposes, but has been widely\r\npublicized of recent years as a possible method of commercial\r\nculture. A high degree of control of factors governing growth is\r\nundertaken and difficulties are proportionately increased. Hence no\r\nextensive commercial development has occurred. A good presentation\r\nof the method has been offered by Hoagland and Arnon.[1]\r\n\r\n\r\n      The Tomato Plant\r\n\r\nTo manage a crop, one must needs know the plant. To know the various\r\ncharacters of the tomato helps one to master its culture.\r\n\r\nThe tomato belongs to the night shade family, the Solanaceae of the\r\nbotanist, along with the potato, tobacco, petunia, pepper, eggplant,\r\nnight shade, jimson weed and many other plants useful and noxious.\r\n\r\nThe tomato is a warm-season crop, sensitive to frost but reasonably\r\nresistant to heat and drought, thriving under a wide range of\r\nclimate and soil. A frost free season of seventy-five to ninety days\r\nwill mature home garden tomatoes in useful quantities if good plants\r\nare set but over 120 days are needed for economical commercial\r\nproduction. Plant growing requires six to eight weeks previous to\r\nsetting out-of-doors. Each fruit requires about six weeks from\r\nblossom to ripeness. The fruit ripens best for yield, color and\r\nquality when the weather is warm and sunny. Low temperatures without\r\nfrost are not favorable for growth and prolonged conditions of this\r\nsort may \"check\" the plant and retard the response when higher\r\ntemperatures come.\r\n\r\nThe tomato is sensitive to extreme day-length, setting fruit at 7 to\r\n19 hours but not at 5 or 24 hours.[2]\r\n\r\nThe tomato responds readily to fertilizers and to moisture, coming\r\nquickly into vigorous growth after unfavorable conditions, unless\r\ntoo badly stunted.\r\n\r\nAs long as moisture and nutrients are available and other conditions\r\nare favorable, a tomato plant will continue to branch and blossom\r\nand make fruit almost indefinitely. A pruned single stem plant in a\r\ngreenhouse at Cornell once reached a length of over 40 feet during a\r\nyear and a half of growth. Thus, it is really a herbaceous\r\nperennial grown in northern climates as an annual.\r\n\r\nThe plant branches freely at leaf joints but fruit clusters are\r\nformed along the bare stem,--a habit not common among plants. Some\r\nvarieties are \"determinate\" in habit, sometimes miscalled\r\n\"self-pruning,\" as branches only attain limited length.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 2.--The tomato flower. Varieties differ in\r\nprotrusion of pistil beyond the stamen column. If style is too\r\nshort, pollination may fail; also, if too long. A long pistil\r\nincreases danger of damage from heat and drying out.]\r\n\r\nHot, dry winds often damage floral parts and the blossoms drop\r\nwithout setting fruit.\r\n\r\nSmith[3] has shown that pollen grains germinate best at 85 deg. F.,\r\nalmost as well at 70 deg. F., poorly at 50 deg. F. and very poorly at 100 deg.\r\nF.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 3.--Long section of tomato flower.]\r\n\r\nThe flowers of the tomato are borne in simple racemes or, in some\r\nvarieties, in compound clusters. The flowers are normally on the\r\nplan of 5 but cultivated varieties may have six or eight sepals and\r\npetals. Sepals are narrow and may be as much as an inch long. Petals\r\nare united at the base. Stamens are united by the anthers\r\nsurrounding the style and stigma. The ovary or little tomato is\r\nabove the calyx but, as it grows, it carries corolla and stamens\r\noutward until they, with stigma and style, drop off. Length of style\r\nis a fairly important character in its bearing on pollination and on\r\nsusceptibility to heat and wind injury.\r\n\r\n\r\n      Seedless Fruits\r\n\r\nRecent experiments by several workers have demonstrated the\r\npossibilities of inducing development of fruits without pollination\r\n(parthenocarpy) by means of certain chemical compounds, notably\r\nindolebutyric acid, although others are effective.[4] This method\r\nyields seedless fruits and promises to be of value in insuring a\r\nyield of fruits under conditions unfavorable for natural setting.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n      II\r\n\r\n      CHOOSE THE SOIL AND FEED THE PLANT\r\n\r\n\r\nAlmost anywhere that other things will grow, the tomato thrives--so\r\nfar as soil type is concerned.\r\n\r\nFlorida grows tomatoes on coral soils that appear too poor to\r\nproduce any useful crop. The fields of South Jersey are very sandy\r\nbut tomatoes do well despite costly control of moisture and\r\nfertility. In some canning sections, clay loams and even clay soils\r\nare used. The ideal is a medium sandy loam, well supplied with humus\r\nfor good water holding capacity. Lighter soils are generally\r\nearlier. Tomatoes on drouthy soils are likely to suffer from blossom\r\nend rot as well as from poor growth. Good drainage is required. Muck\r\nor peat soils will grow tomatoes but they are not commonly used for\r\ncommercial production.\r\n\r\nLiming is not important for tomatoes even on fairly acid soils,\r\nassuming, of course, that the very small actual calcium requirement\r\nof the plant is met. This is generally confirmed by experiments but\r\nit does not preclude the merit of lime in favoring green manure\r\ncrops which, in turn, make the soil more suitable for tomatoes.\r\n\r\nThe dominant element in most sound tomato fertility programs is\r\nphosphorus with nitrogen second and potash third. Recommendations of\r\ngeneral application are not possible but each need must be met\r\nbefore other beneficial additions can be fully effective.\r\n\r\nIn the home garden, a program that keeps up fertility for other\r\ncrops will suffice for tomatoes. In commercial production,\r\nespecially for canning, where prices received are usually low, the\r\nprogram must be neatly cut to fit the soil, the crop system, the\r\nvalue of the tomatoes and the costs of materials. A canning crop in\r\nthose sections where yields are almost bound to be low, will not\r\njustify heavy investment in fertilizer. Where much is spent for\r\nirrigation, plant growing, staking and pruning, one cannot afford to\r\ncurtail the fertilizer investment that will bring maximum return.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 4.--How nitrate nitrogen affects tomato\r\ngrowth. Plants, grown in quartz sand, with plenty of other\r\nnutrients, received definite amounts of nitrate, in one application.\r\nA4, None. D5, 8 grams. F2, 32 grams. J4, 256 grams. N4, Soil and\r\nmanure. (1 ounce = about 28 grams).]\r\n\r\nThe task of this chapter is not to tell the grower how best to\r\nprovide fertilizer for tomatoes but to help him in making his own\r\nplan for his own need. Research results and practical experience\r\nboth contribute. One may well consult neighbors, county agent and\r\nextension specialist, as well as the many books and bulletins that\r\nare available.\r\n\r\n\r\n      Nitrogen\r\n\r\nNitrogen is very important to insure the growth of vine without\r\nwhich a good crop may not be expected. Lands vary more widely in\r\nnitrogen content than in phosphorus and potash. Sandy soils are\r\ncommonly deficient in this element and often difficult to keep\r\nsupplied. Here liberal applications are needed. Up to a hundred\r\npounds[5] of actual nitrogen may prove profitable where other\r\nconditions justify. Heavier soils, well managed and manured during\r\nrotation, require less nitrogen and fair results may be obtained\r\nwith no fertilizer where investment must be kept to a minimum.\r\n\r\nForm of nitrogen to be used is largely a matter of economy though\r\nnitrate for part of it may be desirable early in the season when\r\nsoil is cold and nitrification slow. Nitrate is desirable for side\r\ndressing but even here ammonia and other forms are now considered\r\nsuitable when the soil is warm.\r\n\r\n\r\n      Failure to Set Fruit\r\n\r\nWhy do tomatoes sometimes run to vine with failure to set fruit?\r\nThis is an old, old query and, since 1918, has been, directly or\r\nindirectly, the occasion of more research projects than any other\r\nhorticultural topic. Kraus and Kraybill[6] set the ball a-rolling\r\nwith a paper which called attention first to the observations of\r\nKlebs in Germany in which he emphasized the fact that external\r\nconditions influence conditions within the plant which in turn\r\ninfluence performance--a veritable chain of causation. Kraus and\r\nKraybill then undertook to relate performance (vegetative growth and\r\nfruitfulness) to internal conditions, chiefly carbohydrate and\r\nnitrogen content of the plant tissues. These, in turn, were traced\r\nback to treatments applied to the soil.\r\n\r\nThey suggested four combinations of vegetation and fruitfulness in\r\nplants as follows:\r\n\r\n      1. Non-vegetative and non-fruitful. Plants whose carbohydrate\r\n      supply has been cut off, say by removal of leaves which make\r\n      carbohydrates. These plants were low in carbohydrate and high\r\n      in nitrogen.\r\n\r\n      2. Vegetative and non-fruitful. These plants were well\r\n      supplied with both carbohydrates and nitrogen. They were of\r\n      the sort we describe as having \"run to vine.\"\r\n\r\n      3. Vegetative and fruitful. These plants were well supplied\r\n      with carbohydrates, but not so liberally supplied with\r\n      nitrogen, thus, providing a balance between the two that was\r\n      favorable for a good crop.\r\n\r\n      4. Non-vegetative and non-fruitful. These plants had ample\r\n      opportunity for carbohydrate making, but were underfed with\r\n      nitrogen and so could not perform well in either vegetation or\r\n      fruit-making.\r\n\r\nKraus and Kraybill conclude that there are certain balances between\r\nthese two groups of compounds--nitrogenous and carbohydrate--which\r\ndetermine the nature of the plant's performance--whether there will\r\nbe too little vegetative growth to permit a crop, whether the plants\r\nwill \"run to vine\" or whether they will show good growth of both\r\nfoliage and fruit.\r\n\r\nFrom experiments in the same field, using definite amounts of\r\nnitrate of soda per plant, Work[7] concluded that while adequate\r\ncarbohydrate supply is necessary for fruiting, excess carbohydrate\r\ndid not, in itself, occasion unfruitfulness but was more likely to\r\nrepresent an accumulation of material unused by reason of deficiency\r\nin some other factor--often nitrogen.\r\n\r\nIt was shown that nitrate of soda does not injure tomatoes until a\r\nconcentration in the soil is attained which is strong enough to\r\nplasmolyze the cells, that is to withdraw water from them by\r\nosmosis. Nor were a wide variety of nitrogen and moisture and manure\r\ntreatments sufficient to induce the Bonny Best variety to \"run to\r\nvine.\" Some varieties are subject to this trouble, mostly of the\r\nlarge, late types.\r\n\r\nMurneek[8] has shown that the fruitfulness of a plant may greatly\r\naffect its internal condition, its vegetative performance and its\r\nlater setting of fruit. A heavy load of developing fruit, with\r\nlimited soil resources, tends to limit growth and setting. Removal\r\nof fruit induces renewal of vegetative growth and of fruit setting.\r\nFailure to set fruit favors vigorous vine growth. This failure may\r\nbe traceable to various causes. (1) To damage to floral parts as the\r\nblasting of the pistil by heat and drouth. Flowers of some varieties\r\nshow tendency toward elongation of pistils with subsequent failure\r\nto develop normal fruit. Smith and Howlett have shown that\r\nenvironmental conditions as well as heredity influence this\r\nelongation. (2) To injury by insects as thrips. (3) To the character\r\nof the variety used, the Bonny group being very slightly susceptible\r\nto failure from over feeding with nitrogen while some late sorts\r\nreadily \"run to vine.\" (4) Shortage of nutrient elements as nitrogen\r\nor phosphorus or others. (5) Lack of adequate light or short day. In\r\nsuch cases, there may be excess of nitrogen for current need with\r\nresultant over-development of leafage. Thus, excess vegetative\r\ngrowth may be a result as well as a cause of poor setting.\r\n\r\n\r\n      Phosphorus\r\n\r\nFertilizer experiments fairly generally point to the frequency with\r\nwhich phosphorus is the limiting factor among nutrients in tomato\r\nproduction. MacGillivray[9] has studied the phosphorus content of the\r\nvarious parts of the plant, concluding that this element is important\r\nthroughout and not alone in seed making or in rapidly growing parts as\r\nhas been believed. Hepler and Kraybill[10] found some years ago and\r\nothers more recently have confirmed the influence of liberal phosphorus\r\ntreatments upon earliness.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 5.--Effect of omission of phosphorus from complete\r\nfertilizer in Western New York.]\r\n\r\n\r\n      Potash\r\n\r\nThe potash requirement of the tomato has not been as thoroughly\r\nstudied as the requirement for the other two major elements. It is\r\nthought that potash has a part in building up sugars into more\r\ncomplex carbohydrates.\r\n\r\nThe consensus of fertilizer experiments suggests that potash is less\r\nimportant on most soils than phosphorus and nitrogen but that if\r\nthese elements are in good supply, increased yields from potash are\r\nlikely.\r\n\r\nLanham in Texas was unable to find a relation between potash\r\nfertilization and resistance to shipping hazards.\r\n\r\n\r\n      Stable Manure\r\n\r\nStable manure has long been recognized as useful for tomatoes. It is\r\ngenerally considered better to apply it to the preceding crop or at\r\nleast the preceding fall than to use it just before setting of\r\nplants. If spring application is necessary, it is better to use well\r\nrotted manure. Stable manure is low in phosphorus. An approximate\r\nstatement would be that 10 tons of manure is roughly equivalent to\r\none ton of a 6-3-6 fertilizer. Thus, 1,000 pounds of 18%\r\nsuperphosphate would bring the analysis to 6-12-6 which would be\r\ngenerally regarded as a good balance.\r\n\r\nA recent publication[11] from Pennsylvania emphasizes the value of\r\nmanures and of phosphorus.\r\n\r\n\r\n      Placement and Side Dressing\r\n\r\nRecent experiments have shown the desirability of placing fertilizer\r\nclose to but not in contact with the roots of the young plants. When\r\nnewly set and before new roots have developed is the time when\r\nnutrient material close at hand is needed to give the plant a\r\nvigorous send-off. Transplanters have been devised with attachments\r\nto place the fertilizer in bands at each side of the row of tomatoes\r\nand about two inches deep.\r\n\r\nRecent experiments, notably by Sayre[12] of New York, have shown the\r\nadvantage of dissolving fertilizer materials in the water used for\r\ntransplanting tomatoes. One combination of materials consists of\r\nammo-phos, 14-48, 2 parts and potassium nitrate, 1 part. Five to\r\neight pounds of this mixture are dissolved in 50 gallons of water\r\nand about 1/4 pint or 1/2 cup is applied to each plant, usually by\r\nthe transplanting machine. There are other suitable mixtures of\r\nnutrients for this purpose. A very small investment in starter\r\nsolutions has shown material increase in total yield. The practice\r\nplaces immediately available nutrients in the soil at the time and\r\nplace to be of maximum usefulness to plants that have been severely\r\nroot-pruned and have not yet had opportunity to rebuild the root\r\nsystem.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n    _Courtesy Campbell Soup Co._\r\n\r\nFIGURE 6.--Cultivating and side-dressing tomatoes.]\r\n\r\nAnother critical stage in tomato growth comes when much fruit has\r\nbeen set in the clusters and demands upon plant and soil are\r\nespecially heavy. At this stage, side dressing with nitrogen is\r\nhelpful in maintaining plant growth and providing resources for\r\ngrowth and maturing of fruit. On sandy or nutrient-deficient soils,\r\nmore than one side dressing may be advisable. Sodium nitrate is\r\ncommonly used but other materials are suitable after the soil has\r\nwarmed up. Side dressing with fertilizer in solution has been\r\nrecommended recently by Tiedjens of New Jersey.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n      III\r\n\r\n      THE BEST IN SEED IS NONE TOO GOOD\r\n\r\n\r\nA tomato crop may be much poorer than the seed from which it grows\r\nbut it can be no better.\r\n\r\nThe tomato seed is short-oval and flattened in shape, covered\r\nthickly with short silky hairs. The embryo or baby plant is coiled\r\nin a spiral and imbedded in the endosperm (reserve food supply).\r\nThree or four years is generally given as the life of the seed but\r\nit often remains viable much longer--up to 10 or 12 years in extreme\r\ncases. Good seed should germinate 85% to 90%.\r\n\r\nTomato seed sprouts readily, requiring fairly warm temperature, say,\r\n70 deg. to 75 deg. F. for best results. It germinates very slowly at 40 deg. to\r\n50 deg. F.\r\n\r\n\r\n      Breeding\r\n\r\nBeing a major vegetable crop, the tomato has received much attention\r\nfrom plant breeders. Objectives sought include good cannery type,\r\nresistance to the fusarium wilt and other diseases, better\r\ngreenhouse forms, improved general market and home garden sorts, and\r\nvarieties adapted for arduous conditions such as hot and dry summers\r\nor very short growing seasons.\r\n\r\nThe tomato is largely but not wholly self pollinated and pollen is\r\nnot carried far. Thus, it is not difficult to breed to practically a\r\npure-line condition.\r\n\r\nTomatoes for seed are usually ground up and the seed and fine pulp\r\nare separated from the skins and coarse material by screening. The\r\njuice, fine pulp and seeds are allowed to ferment from 24 to 48\r\nhours, or until the jelly-like pulp is readily washed away. After\r\nwashing, the seed is dried in thin layers and stored. A bushel of\r\ntomatoes may be expected to yield 2-1/2 to 4 ounces of seed and an\r\nacre of tomatoes, from 100 to 225 pounds. These vary greatly\r\naccording to varieties and conditions.\r\n\r\nWellington[13] and others have shown that first generation seed from\r\ncrosses of suitable varieties show a marked increase of vigor\r\n(heterosis or hybrid vigor) over either parent or over the later\r\ngenerations. This fact would seem to offer possibilities in\r\npractical use, but it has not thus far proved of value.\r\n\r\n\r\n      Selection Methods\r\n\r\nMany growers find it profitable to save their own tomato seed. The\r\nplant is an annual, the important characters are quite readily\r\nobserved and natural crossing is not serious. For these reasons, the\r\nenterprise is not as difficult as with most vegetables, although, if\r\ndone well, it makes heavy demands in labor and care at a time when\r\nthe grower has much else to do.\r\n\r\nThe first step in selection is to establish clearly the ideal to be\r\nsought, recording it in detail on paper for future reference.\r\nSelections should be made on the basis of the plant, not of the\r\nindividual fruit. It is the plant that is reproduced and the seed\r\nfrom \"crown clusters\" is no earlier than seed from later settings.\r\nThe field should be searched soon after blooming time and plants\r\nthat appear promising should be marked. These plants should be\r\nexamined three or four times as the season advances, and markers\r\npulled from plants that do not measure up to the desired standard.\r\nSuppose ten plants remain; all fruits from each of these may be\r\nsaved, keeping the seed of each plant separate. All or part of the\r\nseed may be planted in separate rows the next year for further\r\nselection and to note which parents best transmit their excellent\r\npoints. If only a small amount of seed is required, direct\r\nselections may be made for use in planting for the general crop. If\r\na larger amount of seed is required, seed from one or two of the\r\nbest plants should be planted in multiplication plats. Off-type\r\nplants should be removed from such plantings, but otherwise all the\r\nseed may be saved for use. Repeated selection results in constant\r\nimprovement until the stock becomes a \"pure line\" or practically so.\r\n\r\nLindstrom of Iowa has led in research on the genetics of tomatoes,\r\nchromosome relations and mode of inheritance. Many scientific papers\r\ndeal with inheritance methods and results. The Yearbook of\r\nAgriculture (U.S.D.A.) for 1937 contains a valuable chapter on\r\ntomato breeding. It may also be had as Yearbook Separate 1581.\r\n\r\n\r\n      Certification\r\n\r\nAs with certain other kinds of seeds, certification service for tomatoes\r\nhas now been set up in several states. Certification is a most useful\r\nincentive toward care in breeding and handling and affords valuable\r\nassurance to the buyer. It is necessary to know just what is guaranteed\r\nby the certificate. It is at the same time wise to be informed as to the\r\ninclusiveness and methods of the certification.\r\n\r\n\r\n      The Ideal Variety\r\n\r\nIn breeding for better varieties of tomatoes, the following are some of\r\nthe characters to be sought:\r\n\r\n      (1) A vigorous vine which is necessary to produce abundant\r\n      fruit and to protect from sunscald.\r\n\r\n      (2) Resistance to disease especially to fusarium.\r\n\r\n      (3) High productiveness with moderate number of fruits per\r\n      cluster--say, 5 to 8.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 7.--Types of tomato interiors. 1, 5. Small fruited\r\nsorts. 2, 6, 9. Bonny Best. 3, 7, 10. Chalk Jewel. 3, 7, 11. Stone. 4,\r\n8. Earliana. 12. Ponderosa.]\r\n\r\n      (4) Evenness of maturity. This is somewhat out of line with\r\n      the nature of the tomato but much could be accomplished toward\r\n      the goal of varieties that make their crop and are gone,\r\n      eliminating long picking periods and the drag of inferior\r\n      fruit toward the end of the season. The so-called\r\n      determinate habit of some varieties such as Pritchard is a\r\n      step in this direction.\r\n\r\n      (5) Size suitable for expected use and for market demand.\r\n      Greenhouse tomatoes are generally smaller than those for\r\n      cannery. Uniformity of size is increasingly important with\r\n      wide-spread use of the lug-box pack and of small consumer\r\n      cartons.\r\n\r\n      (6) Globular to oblong shape is desirable for market but is\r\n      less important for cannery. Form should be symmetrical, even\r\n      and smooth.\r\n\r\n      (7) Color should be deep and rich, fully and evenly developed,\r\n      inside and out. Red is generally preferred to pink. The\r\n      difference between red and pink tomatoes does not reside in\r\n      the flesh but in the presence of yellow pigment in the skin of\r\n      the former while the skin of the latter is without pigment.\r\n      Yellow tomatoes are also extant.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 8.--The Earliana tomato. A picture of a single\r\nfruit cannot adequately describe a variety. 1-3. Rough types, common in\r\nolder strains. 4. Typical interior. 5, 6. Stem end. 7-9. Good type\r\nresulting from selection. 10-12. Pointed-round type occurring frequently\r\nin improved strains. A. Unusually large cluster. B. Typical Earliana\r\ncluster showing compound branching. C. Unbranched cluster of Bonny Best\r\nfor comparison.]\r\n\r\n      (8) Skin should be thick and tough. This safeguards against\r\n      damage on the way to market and favors ease of peeling. Those\r\n      saladists who serve sliced tomatoes with skins unremoved, may\r\n      call for a thin, tender skin but this practice finds no\r\n      encouragement from discriminating partakers.\r\n\r\n      (9) Flesh should be abundant in thick walls with a minimum of\r\n      watery pulp surrounding seeds. In general, a structure of many\r\n      small cells is desirable.\r\n\r\n\r\n      Varieties\r\n\r\n_Earliana._--The earliness of this old and popular variety outweighs\r\nits demerits where this character is required. The past ten years\r\nhave seen material improvement.\r\n\r\nEarliana is early, of small vine, with small leaves and leaflets.\r\nClusters are compoundly branched, with many fruits. The fruits are\r\nof medium size, deep oblate, cross section often elliptical rather\r\nthan circular. There are many rough irregular fruits, varying in\r\nthis respect with breeding and conditions of growth. Color is red,\r\nnot too deep and tending to be poorly developed at the stem end.\r\nInterior consists of many small cells with thin walls.\r\n\r\n_Bison._--represents a group of varieties bred for rigorous climates\r\nof our most northerly states. A. F. Yeager formerly of North Dakota,\r\nlater of Michigan, now of New Hampshire has led in this\r\ndevelopment.\r\n\r\n_Victor._--is a new variety bred originally by Yeager but introduced\r\nby K. C. Barrons of Michigan. It affords smoother, deeper and better\r\ncolored fruits about as early as Earliana. It is determinate in\r\nhabit and shy in foliage, increasing danger of sunscald. Rich soil\r\nand ample moisture are needed for its best development. _Bounty_ and\r\n_Home Garden_ are similar.\r\n\r\n_Penn State._--Penn State, developed by C. E. Myers of Pennsylvania,\r\nis not as early as Earliana. It is similar in fruit characters\r\nthough distinctly better in color and shape. It is marked by short\r\nbranches (determinate habit) and is designed to give an early crop\r\nto be followed by prompt abandonment of the planting. It is not to\r\nbe confused with Penn State Earliana.\r\n\r\n_Bonny Group._--This group embraces our leading second early\r\nvarieties widely used for home garden, greenhouse, market and\r\ncannery in the north. It includes _Bonny Best_, _John Baer_ and\r\n_Chalk Jewel_ with many additional names and with much confusion of\r\ncharacters among them.\r\n\r\nBonny Best is second early and of medium plant growth. Fruits are\r\ndeep oblate to flattened globe, even and smooth, of good red color,\r\nwith few large, thick-walled cells.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 9.--Marglobe plant.]\r\n\r\nVarieties and strains of this group vary in growth and yield, in\r\nsize, shape and earliness of fruit and in suitability for\r\ngreenhouse, market, cannery and juice. _Stokesdale_ and _Scarlet\r\nDawn_ are meritorious newer names in the group.\r\n\r\n_Marglobe._--This variety was developed by the late Dr. F. J.\r\nPritchard from a cross between Marvel, a French variety lending\r\nresistance to fusarium and Globe, an old variety of fine size and\r\nshape. It is widely used, north and south, for market--green or\r\nripe, for cannery and to some extent, for forcing.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 10.--Marglobe fruit.]\r\n\r\nMarglobe is a midseason variety, with large vine and foliage,\r\nresistant to fusarium and nailhead spot. Fruits are nearly globular,\r\nshapely and smooth, medium to large, scarlet red, with medium number\r\nof thick walled cells. Marglobe is rather subject to deep radial\r\ncracks.\r\n\r\n_Pritchard_ is of the general type of Marglobe but is earlier, with\r\nshort branching habit and resistance to nailhead rust and to\r\nfusarium, and, perhaps, is less subject to cracking.\r\n\r\n_Greater Baltimore_ is used chiefly for canning in long-season\r\ndistricts. It is late, with large vine, large flat fruits of\r\nexcellent scarlet red, outside and in, with many thick walled cells.\r\n_Indiana Baltimore_ is a variant widely grown in the mid-west for\r\ncannery.\r\n\r\n_Rutgers_ was developed by L. G. Schermerhorn at the New Jersey\r\nExperiment Station for fine juice and canning characters--color,\r\nflavor and substance. Growth is vigorous and yields are heavy;\r\nfruits are large, flattened and well colored.\r\n\r\n_Gulf State Market_ is a second early shipping tomato, generally\r\nharvested green. It is flattened in shape, of well developed pink\r\ncolor and good interior.\r\n\r\n_Comet Group._--These trace mostly to English or other European\r\norigin and are increasingly used for greenhouse and for staking\r\nout-of-doors. Comet is small, flattened, slightly corrugated about\r\nthe stem, of fine even red color, very firm and solid, with few very\r\nthick walled cells. Other names are _Sunrise_, and _Lord Roberts_.\r\nSeveral American forcing strains have been developed with at least\r\none parent of this group--_Ideal_, _Grand Rapids Forcing_, _Field\r\nStation Comet_, _Trellis_, _Michigan State Forcing_, _Lloyd\r\nForcing_, _Blair Forcing_ and others.\r\n\r\n_King Humbert_ and _San Marzano_ represent the small Italian oblong\r\ntomatoes that are prized for their thick walls, fine color and\r\nsuitability for puree, paste and soup.\r\n\r\n_Ponderosa_ is popular for home garden, a \"beef-steak\" tomato of\r\nvery large size, irregular shape, flat, pink, with many small cells\r\nand of very mild sub-acid flavor. It is best grown to single stem.\r\n_Oxheart_ is large, heart shaped, pink and very meaty. Others of\r\nthis general type may be had in red, yellow and orange flesh. In\r\ngeneral, the whole group lacks in prolificacy.\r\n\r\n_Oddities._--Tomato fanciers often plant seed of Red and Yellow\r\nPear, Cherry, Currant, Peach with its fuzzy skin, Plum and others.\r\nThey are prized for preserves and for decoration. Ground Cherry or\r\nHusk Tomato is not a true tomato but belongs to a different genus\r\n(Physalis). It makes excellent preserves. Well do I remember\r\nsneaking off from the other kids for solitary plunder of the little\r\nrow that was usually in Grandma's garden.\r\n\r\nComprehensive descriptions of leading varieties of tomatoes have\r\nbeen published by the United States Department of Agriculture in\r\nMiscellaneous Publication 160, the result of statistical and verbal\r\nnotations over several years at five widely scattered stations of\r\nthe country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n      IV\r\n\r\n      STRONG PLANTS FOR EARLY MATURITY AND HEAVY CROP\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of the ways to make money from tomatoes is to mature them early,\r\nselling while the price is still high. There is a big difference\r\nbetween $.10 a pound and $.10 a basket. Shipped and ripened green\r\nwrap tomatoes cannot be very cheap on northern markets even though\r\nSouthern growers may realize little for them.\r\n\r\nAnother way to profit is to grow good plants to sell. Judging by the\r\nspindling, crowded, soft or over-hardened plants so common in stores,\r\nthere should be great opportunity here and, as a matter of fact,\r\nmany market gardeners do well in this business realizing welcome\r\nreturns when other income is negligible.\r\n\r\nTo market ten-cent-a-pound tomatoes from out-doors requires good\r\nplants--plants that have passed through their youth nearly or fully\r\nup to blossoming time with benefit of heat and shelter and that are\r\nready to keep up vigorous growth in face of the demands of\r\nfruiting. A few scattering fruits matured early do not suffice.\r\n\r\nEven for cannery, good plants are required. In most regions, plants\r\nare not as good as they should be. All too often, outdoor seed bed\r\nplants are set where cold frame or at least cloth cover should be\r\nemployed. Further north, cold frame plants or second run or other\r\ninferior plants are used instead of the best. That is why many\r\ncanning companies have greenhouses and grow plants for their\r\nfarmers.\r\n\r\nAnd in the home garden, the quality of vine ripened fruit along with\r\nthe satisfaction of early maturity are goals worth striving for.\r\n\r\nPlant growing is a game of skill. It calls for keen observation,\r\nconstant and faithful attention to small details, and a high order\r\nof workmanship in the various operations. Furthermore, when a\r\nconsiderable number of plants are to be grown, it calls for good\r\norganization and rapid work if costs are not to be unduly increased.\r\nA transplanter who makes three motions where two will suffice is\r\nlikely to turn profit into loss, for the loss of a second when\r\nrepeated thousands of times makes many hours.\r\n\r\nThe grower who is producing tomatoes for first-early maturity wants\r\na plant that will withstand the rigors of transplanting and of\r\ninclement weather which may follow, that will start immediately into\r\ngrowth, and that will mature fruit in good quantity at the earliest\r\npossible date. This usually means a plant about ten inches tall,\r\nwith heavy, firm, dark-colored stem (though not over-hardened), a\r\nheavy body of dark, healthy foliage, and a cluster of blossoms, with\r\npossibly a fruit or two already set. If the buds in the axils of the\r\nleaves have begun growth, no harm will be done.\r\n\r\nMany growers are doubtful whether it is well to have fruit set on\r\nplants when they are transplanted in the field, as they claim that\r\nthe little tomatoes are often lost and in any case the progress of\r\nthe plant is retarded. Such plants must be handled with great skill.\r\nIf they are severely checked when taken to the field, other and less\r\nadvanced plants may do as well. There is danger in having plants too\r\nfar advanced, and an unexpected delay in field setting may result in\r\nspindling and over-hardening that may prove disastrous. A vigorous\r\nand properly hardened plant that is younger will do better under\r\nsuch circumstances. Some growers protect themselves by having plants\r\nof more than one sort.\r\n\r\n\r\n      Open-bed Plant Growing\r\n\r\nWith favorable conditions and careful methods, good plants can be\r\ngrown in open beds but they must be grown and used where the season\r\nis long or be grown in the south and shipped north.\r\n\r\nSoil should be free of disease and nematodes, of good physical\r\ncharacter, full of humus and nutrients.\r\n\r\nSeed may be sowed a week or two after \"average date of last killing\r\nfrost\" which may be learned from county agent or weather bureau.\r\nFurther south planting times are gauged by the time tomatoes are to\r\nbe set and by experience as to safe or reasonably safe sowing dates.\r\nRows are usually a foot apart, more or less. Good plants call for\r\nsowing thinly, 6 to 12 seeds per foot, but several seeds per inch\r\nare not unusual. One may expect a million plants per acre with close\r\nplanting or 40,000 plants per pound of seed.\r\n\r\n\r\n      Southern Plants\r\n\r\nMany millions of tomato plants are grown in open fields in the south\r\nto be sent to home gardeners in small parcels on seedsmen's orders,\r\nto be sold to commercial growers or to be delivered on contract to\r\ncanners.\r\n\r\nA suitable climate and soil, good seed, freedom from disease and\r\ninsects and good handling and packing are all required for\r\nsatisfactory results. In far too many cases, these requirements have\r\nbeen sadly neglected and a good deal of distrust has been\r\nengendered. Here, as in buying seed, one must discriminate among\r\ngood and poor growers. Canners who order in millions can send men\r\nsouth to investigate and supervise with good results.\r\n\r\nGeorgia now has a certification service for plants that helps\r\ngreatly to build up and maintain high standards.\r\n\r\n\r\n      Growing Early Plants in the North\r\n\r\nVaried programs of plant growing are in vogue in the temperate and\r\ncooler regions. A simple cold frame with or without transplanting\r\nmay be employed. Seedlings may be started in hotbed or greenhouse\r\nand then transplanted to cold frames to finish the job. Some sow\r\nseed early, transplant once in the greenhouse at 1-1/2 or 2 inches\r\neach way and then again to cold frame with wide spacing say, 4 x 4\r\ninches or using pots or dirt bands.\r\n\r\nFor this method, as much as twelve weeks may be allowed but if space\r\npermits, excellent results may be achieved in seven or eight weeks\r\ntransplanting but once to pots or to 4 x 4 inches in flat or bed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 11.--A good small greenhouse for plant\r\ngrowing.]\r\n\r\n\r\n      The Place to Grow Plants\r\n\r\nFor northern climates, greenhouses are practically required.\r\nCanneries or other large growers, have wide houses similar to those\r\nused for winter maturing crops. A market gardener may have a little\r\nhouse of 10' x 20' to 20' x 60' or larger as needed. If one does not\r\nobject to some inconvenience and discomfort, a hotbed may be\r\nused--heated with hot water or electricity, or as in years past,\r\nwith fermenting manure. Cold frames may be covered with glass sash\r\nas in the case of hotbeds, or cloth may be used. There are also\r\nmaterials consisting of wire cloth filled with cellulose film.\r\nSpecial mats of straw or of quilted burlap may be used for extra\r\ncover and large growers often employ coarse manure, straw or marsh\r\nhay.\r\n\r\nMany a tomato gets its start in life in a small flat in a kitchen\r\nwindow--perhaps, in a cigar box. Such seedlings may then be carried\r\nforward in hot bed or cold frame.\r\n\r\n\r\n      Beds, Flats and Pots\r\n\r\nGrowing plants directly in ground beds in the greenhouse and\r\ndirectly in the soil in the hotbeds or cold frames, is rather\r\ncommon. However, the use of flats or plant boxes in plant growing\r\noffers a number of advantages as compared with planting in the bed.\r\nTransplanting can be done at benches under conditions of comfort and\r\nconvenience which make for efficiency. Moisture can be more\r\nprecisely controlled and flats can be shifted if some plants grow\r\nfaster than others. Plants can be moved with more dirt on the roots,\r\nand this is a great advantage when plants are sold and hauled some\r\ndistance, though, of course, pulled plants are handled more cheaply.\r\nOn the other hand, the first cost, and the maintenance and storage\r\nof the flats must be considered. Flats may be set on the ground in\r\nthe greenhouse without use of benches.\r\n\r\nFlats are of many dimensions, ordinarily six to ten per sash or\r\nabout 18 x 22 inches or 13 x 18 inches outside measure. They may be\r\nmade of lumber from used boxes, but they ought to be uniform in size\r\nand made to fit beds without loss of space. The more durable kinds\r\nof wood, cypress or chestnut are preferred. Some growers make the\r\nbottoms of the flats of square-mesh galvanized screen (hardware\r\ncloth), about five or six meshes to the inch. This allows roots to\r\npenetrate the soil of the beds, permits root pruning by shifting,\r\nand there is no wooden bottom to rot.\r\n\r\nSome growers use clay pots for plants which are receiving special\r\ncare. Their cost is an obstacle though they are used repeatedly.\r\nSuch pots also hold less soil for the area occupied than flats or\r\nsquare dirt bands.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 12.--Plants for the early crop. 1. Shows\r\nplants in paper bands of excellent proportion and thrift but not yet\r\nin bloom. 2. In blossom but fruit has not yet set. 3. Similar to 2\r\nbut a little further advanced and has actually set fruit.]\r\n\r\nPaper pots are used to some extent. Organisms decomposing the paper\r\nmay use and so render unavailable some of the nitrogen of the soil\r\nthus hindering the growth of the plants. This may be corrected by\r\nseeing that abundant nitrogen is present in the soil either when\r\nmade up or by later application of nitrate sowed upon the soil while\r\nplants are dry or applied in solution in watering.\r\n\r\nDirt bands of veneer are used and are very satisfactory. Blocking as\r\npracticed by many growers is a cheap and effective way of attaining\r\nmuch the same results.\r\n\r\n\r\n      The Blocking System\r\n\r\nWhen the cold frame is prepared for the last transplanting, two\r\ninches of fairly well-rotted manure is laid down and two or three\r\ninches of prepared soil is placed on top. Plants are set about four\r\ninches apart each way. About a week before field setting, a butcher\r\nknife, or a hoe which has been straightened and sharpened, is run\r\nbetween rows both ways. This cuts the roots whereupon the plant at\r\nonce begins to form new feeders within the block thus reducing, to\r\nsome extent at least, the damage which might be caused by\r\ntransplanting. The method is also used with flats.\r\n\r\n\r\n      Soil\r\n\r\nSoil for plant growing should be free of disease and nematodes,\r\nfriable, not readily forming a crust, receiving and retaining\r\nmoisture well, but drying off quickly on the surface after watering\r\nand well supplied with nutrients. A sandy loam base with good humus\r\ncontent is desirable. It may be prepared, beginning a year or two\r\nahead by growing and plowing under well fertilized green manure\r\ncrops. Or a compost heap may be prepared with successive layers of\r\nsoil and manure or other humus making material. In either case, it\r\nis usually mixed a time or two by shoveling over or by passing\r\nthrough a shredding machine or a coarse screen.\r\n\r\nIf trouble is likely to be experienced from damping-off fungi, the\r\nsoil may be heated to 200 deg. F. and held there for an hour, using oven\r\nor electric or steam sterilizer. Seed may also be treated with red\r\ncopper oxid or semesan.\r\n\r\n\r\n      Seed and Seed Sowing\r\n\r\nTomato seed runs about 125,000 to 150,000 per pound. An ounce of\r\nseed is usually depended upon for plants for an acre. For growing\r\nseedlings, seed may be sowed up to 100 or more per foot of row. For\r\na maximum number of strong seedlings from a small amount of seed,\r\nthinner sowing is desirable. Rows are usually about two inches\r\napart, and a quarter of an inch is sufficient cover. The seedlings\r\nbreak ground in a week or ten days.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 13.--Tin can prepared for sowing tomato seed.]\r\n\r\nUniformity of depth of rows and of covering is important. Otherwise,\r\nseedlings will come up unevenly and there will be considerable\r\nwaste.\r\n\r\n\r\n      Care of Seedlings\r\n\r\nWater and heat should be provided to permit a steady and moderate\r\nrate of growth in plants. Over-watering and high temperature yield\r\nsoft and spindling plants and also plants that are overgrown and\r\nthat are liable to severe checking before field setting.\r\nUnder-watering and low temperature give stunted plants. The\r\nthermometer at the earlier stages of growth may well stand around 70\r\nto 75 degrees by day and 10 degrees lower at night. A reasonable\r\nrange of temperature and moisture gives opportunity for the skillful\r\ngrower to forward or retard his plants as seems best. Great care\r\nshould be exercised to water evenly. It is necessary to watch the\r\nplants constantly to detect the slightest variations in growth. The\r\nwatering may then be modified and even progress insured.\r\n\r\nVentilation finds its chief significance as a means of controlling\r\ntemperature and humidity, though actual change of air may be a\r\nfactor.\r\n\r\nHigh soil moisture, high humidity, high temperature, and faulty\r\nventilation, all favor the ravages of the various damping-off fungi\r\nmentioned above which cause little plants to rot off near the\r\nground.\r\n\r\n\r\n      Transplanting\r\n\r\nThe main advantage of transplanting plants before they are set in\r\nthe field is to give them increased space, or, in other words, to\r\nconserve space in greenhouses and frames. Other advantages have been\r\nclaimed, but in many instances the gains have resulted from more\r\nspace rather than from the actual shift. Transplanting checks growth\r\nthrough breakage and disturbance of the root system. Loomis[14]\r\nfinds that \"the immediate effect of transplanting is a reduction in\r\nthe water supply, and the immediate and long-time results are\r\ndependent upon the severity and duration of such reduction.\"\r\nTransplanting has little effect upon very young plants and a shift\r\nat the age of six or eight weeks checks the plant about as much as\r\ntwo earlier transplantings. The tomato falls in the group of plants\r\nthat stand transplanting well, roots being rapidly replaced.\r\nTransplanting breaks roots and so results in the growth of branches\r\nwhich are shorter than the members of the old system. The new system\r\nis accordingly less severely damaged in later transplantings.\r\n\r\nTo insure efficiency, the work of transplanting merits careful\r\nattention. Carelessness as to details means loss through unevenness\r\nof plants. For example, if soil is not carefully packed at the edges\r\nand corners of the flats, irregular water supply and irregular\r\ngrowth result. If much transplanting is to be done, it pays to\r\ndivide up the work, as is done in a factory. Have a good place for\r\ndoing the work--a warm, light, and comfortable room. Tired workers\r\nare not efficient. Spotting boards are of service if properly made\r\nand correctly used. Soil should always contain just the right degree\r\nof moisture to allow holes to stand open. Care must be taken that\r\nthe workers in setting plants do not double the roots or close the\r\nholes at the top leaving the roots dangling in an open space below.\r\n\r\nIt is said that a good worker will prick out 10,000 plants per day,\r\nthough everything must be convenient to accomplish this and many\r\ngrowers regard 6,000 plants as a good day's work.\r\n\r\n\r\n      Pruning Young Plants\r\n\r\nPruning of tops injures rather than helps the plant, for it destroys\r\nleaves which are the machines that make carbohydrates, the principal\r\nmaterial for growth. Pruning to cure legginess is bad. Proper\r\nmanagement of time, temperature and water will provide adequate\r\ncontrol and if plants should become leggy, it is better to plant\r\nthem by laying them down in a trench with a few inches of top above\r\nground than it is to prune them.\r\n\r\nNipping out the growing point with the first cluster of flower buds\r\nis sometimes practiced to encourage branching and a heavier yield of\r\nearly fruit. If this is done, ample space and nutrients must\r\naccompany careful management. Otherwise, the plant finds itself with\r\ninadequate resources to do a big job.\r\n\r\n\r\n      Hardening\r\n\r\nTomato plants cannot be made frost proof, but low temperature,\r\nreduced moisture supply, partial starvation, and crowding all tend\r\nto make plants more resistant to cold, to drying winds, to heat, to\r\nmechanical injury such as breakage of leaves and stems, and even to\r\ncut-worm attacks. Plants can be hardened appreciably in a short\r\ntime--say a week. It is now generally accepted that moisture control\r\nis more useful than reduced temperature as a means of hardening.\r\nStarving and crowding are not desirable methods. Plants can be kept\r\non the dry side if glass or other water-shedding cover is\r\navailable.\r\n\r\nGreat care must be exercised to avoid over-hardening of tomato\r\nplants, for in this way a check in growth is incurred from which\r\nthey recover slowly, and perhaps never fully.\r\n\r\nMuch study has been given to the changes in plants which underlie\r\nthe hardening process, and papers by Harvey, Rosa, Loomis, and\r\nothers should be consulted in this connection.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 14.--Plants that have been crowded and\r\novergrown, probably undernourished and over-hardened. Plants like\r\nthis are very often set in the field. They are definitely slow in\r\nstarting growth.]\r\n\r\nWatts[15] has shown that adverse conditions, especially low\r\ntemperature and water deficiency prevailing at the time when fruit\r\nclusters are barely beginning to form, commonly occasion the\r\ndevelopment of misshapen fruits.\r\n\r\nFaithful spraying or dusting with Bordeaux in the plant bed has\r\nproved a useful means of forestalling destructive leaf blights which\r\noften devastate whole fields.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n      V\r\n\r\n      GOOD CULTURE FAVORS GOOD RETURNS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe tomato is not especially exacting as to care after it has been\r\nset out-of-doors. It will do business if given half a chance. At the\r\nsame time, much can be done to favor earliness, good yield and high\r\nquality.\r\n\r\n\r\n      Time of Planting\r\n\r\nIn general, tomatoes are set in field or garden as soon as danger of\r\nfrost is reasonably past. Suppose May 1st is average date of last\r\nkilling frost. Growers would make general plantings from May 18th to\r\n25th though, in rare instances, frost might occur as late as May\r\n28th or 30th. The last week of May is planting time over a vast area\r\nof the North. Venturesome souls will set home garden plants as early\r\nas May 10th, standing ready to replant if necessary. There is little\r\ngain in rushing the season too much, however, for the tomato is not\r\nonly sensitive to frost but it does not thrive under what people\r\ncall \"raw, mean, chilly weather.\" Such conditions may also be\r\nresponsible for misshapen fruits. A grower for local market not\r\ninfrequently risks a share of his plants before safe setting time in\r\nthe hope that warm weather may give the crop a good start toward\r\nearly ripe fruit to sell at high prices.\r\n\r\nDelayed planting and use of plants that do not start quickly into\r\nvigorous growth is the cause of heavy losses in the north,\r\nespecially among cannery growers. Better quality and heavier yields\r\nare attained if the bulk of the crop matures before cool weather in\r\nthe fall. In the south, it is necessary to get good plant\r\ndevelopment and a full set of fruit before hot weather which often\r\ndestroys the blossoms.\r\n\r\n\r\n      Plant Protectors\r\n\r\nMany forms of plant protectors are on the market--of paper and of\r\nother materials. These act as little greenhouses for the individual\r\nplant, protecting against frost and promoting growth. Plants may be\r\nset out-of-doors a couple of weeks earlier by their use. The most\r\ncommon forms are of translucent paper reinforced by pasted strips\r\nof paper or by wire. The trick is to devise one that is cheap, that\r\nwill admit maximum light and that will withstand the weather. For\r\ntomatoes, they need to be tall, which makes the problem of wind\r\nresistance more serious.\r\n\r\nFor emergencies, opaque cover, baskets upside down or even newspaper\r\nmay be used. Many a field has been saved by burying the plants when\r\nfrost threatened, carefully uncovering when danger is past.\r\n\r\n\r\n      Spacing\r\n\r\nUntrained tomatoes are set at distances from 3-1/2 feet each way to\r\n7 x 7 feet or even more. The extreme width is found on rich\r\nirrigated lands in California where plants make tremendous growth.\r\nThe closer spacings are found on lighter soils where humus, plant\r\nfood, and moisture are not too abundant. The variety should also be\r\nconsidered. Sixteen square feet per plant is about average.\r\n\r\nCheck row planting is common, though it is not feasible where\r\ntransplanters are used. Wider spacing between the rows than between\r\nplants is desirable as it permits later cultivation one way and\r\nleaves a better passage for pickers with less damage to plants and\r\nfruits. Thus, 3-1/2 x 4-1/2 feet might be preferred to 4 x 4 feet.\r\n\r\nRows for single stem, staked and pruned plants may be as close as\r\nthree feet and plants may be as close as eighteen or even twelve\r\ninches, though some growers contend that two feet is close enough.\r\n\r\n\r\n      Methods of Planting\r\n\r\nThe essential point in field setting is to pack the soil firmly\r\nabout the roots, thus establishing maximum contact for moisture\r\nabsorption. Whatever the method of planting, the aim should be to\r\nget the plants from the old home to the new with as little delay and\r\ncheck in growth as possible. For the first-early crop, they should\r\nbe moved so that \"they never know it.\" With bands, pots or blocking\r\nin flats or beds, it is feasible to avoid practically all\r\ndisturbance of roots.\r\n\r\nThe tomato will, under ordinary favorable conditions, take hold and\r\ngrow even if shaken quite free of earth. Plants, however, should be\r\ndug loose rather than pulled, to prevent undue breakage of roots.\r\n\r\nPlants ought to be watered well some hours before transplanting.\r\nTransplanting machines and hand planters of the Masters type give a\r\nlittle shot of water at the root, thus helping to establish contact\r\nwith the soil. Starter solutions are discussed on page 35. These\r\nmachines are commonly used for cannery setting and, to some extent,\r\nfor market tomatoes. Blocked plants can be set pretty fast by hand\r\nwith much less disturbance of roots. Some manage to set potted or\r\nblocked plants by machine, keeping a ball of earth about the roots.\r\n\r\nThe rows are usually marked out fairly deeply, plants are dropped in\r\nfours between rows and it is a very short job to pack soil about the\r\nclod of earth in which the plant is growing. Another method is for\r\none worker to make an opening with a spade. A second places the\r\nplant in the wedge-like opening and the first steps on the soil to\r\nfirm it solidly about the roots.\r\n\r\nPlants are generally set a little deeper than in the plant bed.\r\n\r\n\r\n      Cultivation\r\n\r\nThe old idea about cultivation was \"the more, the better.\" More\r\nrecent experiments notably those by Thompson have shown that little\r\nneed be done beyond controlling weeds. He found that stirring the\r\nsoil gave no significant increase in yield over mere scraping\r\nsufficient to destroy weeds. It is pretty hard to convince many old\r\ntime gardeners of this. The value of dust mulch for conservation of\r\nmoisture has been pretty well discredited by experimental\r\ncomparisons.\r\n\r\n\r\n      Irrigation\r\n\r\nIrrigation is not essential for tomato production in humid climates\r\nand is seldom provided except under market garden conditions. Water\r\nis occasionally an asset in a dry season and, of course, the grower\r\nwho waters at such times reaps a harvest in higher prices as well as\r\nin increased yield. The advantage of irrigation is especially marked\r\nif dry weather retards plant growth and delays maturity of the first\r\nof the crop, for the high prices of the early market are involved.\r\nJudicious irrigation will sometimes continue production for late\r\nfall market. Yet gardeners seldom plan permanent overhead equipment\r\nfor tomatoes. The movable lines that are now used to a considerable\r\nextent serve well for the tomato crop.\r\n\r\nThe furrow method of irrigating tomatoes is the most common in the\r\nWest. This plan allows the water to make its way down the rows,\r\nslowly soaking in all along the line. The tomato stands drouth\r\nbetter than many of our crops, especially if the soil holds moisture\r\nfairly well, either naturally or through a liberal humus content.\r\nExcessive moisture is doubtless a factor in causing the plants to\r\nrun to vine and drop their blossoms. Hence, in western sections, it\r\nis customary to water thoroughly just before or just after setting\r\nthe plants and then to avoid applications until the setting of fruit\r\nis well advanced.\r\n\r\nThorough soaking is better than frequent light waterings, as it\r\nencourages a better development of root system. An Idaho bulletin\r\nsuggests three irrigations. Late irrigations tend to delay ripening\r\nof fruit, but this object is sought in the late fall shipping\r\ndistricts of California which find their best markets after eastern\r\ncrops have been nipped by frost.\r\n\r\nIrrigation must be handled with care to avoid cracking of fruit,\r\nwhich occurs when soil becomes rather dry and then is heavily\r\nwatered. Watering late in the season is said to make fruit watery\r\nand of poor quality.\r\n\r\n\r\n      Mulching\r\n\r\nR. A. Emerson[16] in 1903 reported results of careful comparisons\r\nbetween vegetables that were cultivated and others that were mulched\r\nwith straw. These results indicate that mulching gives good results\r\nwith tomatoes, both as to yield and quality. However, frost injury\r\nwas more severe on mulched plats, and Emerson points out that the\r\nmulch should not be applied until the plants are well established.\r\n\r\nMulching is recommended by a good many writers and growers and it\r\nseems to be practiced to some extent in Missouri. The advantages\r\nclaimed are conservation of moisture and clean, fine quality fruit.\r\nL. W. Purdum and Sons of Virginia use 4-5 tons per acre of wheat\r\nstraw, staking their plants and irrigating. They report unusually\r\nheavy returns per acre under these methods. The Missouri people\r\napply as much as sixteen tons per acre, making the cover five or six\r\ninches thick. The practice of mulching, however, is not common, and\r\nthe cost will likely prevent its general use.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n      VI\r\n\r\n      TO TRAIN THEM UP OR LET THEM SPREAD\r\n\r\n\r\nGrowers attending conventions will often stay up half the night to\r\nargue about training and pruning tomatoes and to debate the details\r\nof their favorite procedures.\r\n\r\nFor home garden, the method is strongly commended. Many market\r\ngardeners follow the practice and it has gained materially of recent\r\nyears in New England. Some market reports quote staked tomatoes\r\nseparately and at a materially higher level than fruit from unpruned\r\nplants.\r\n\r\nMost of the southern shipping sections follow the practice and it is\r\npractically universal in greenhouses.\r\n\r\nOne way is to drive a stake by each plant tying at several points\r\nalong the stem with cheap twine. The other plan, recently gaining in\r\nfavor, is to set posts every 25 feet or so, string a heavy wire on\r\ntop, and another a foot from the ground. Cheap jute twine is strung\r\nbetween wires and the tomato plants are merely twisted around the\r\nstring. Tying is not required. Some omit the lower wire, tying a\r\nnon-slipping bowline loop around the plant near the ground. In\r\neither case, plants are kept trimmed to a single stem though\r\noccasionally an extra branch is allowed to grow. In southern\r\nIllinois, plants are tied to a short stake without pruning.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 15.--Tomatoes pruned and trained with post,\r\nwire and twine. This is the trellis system of New England.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 16.--Fine clusters on trained plants.]\r\n\r\n\r\n      Pro and Con\r\n\r\nThe advantages claimed for pruning and training are:\r\n\r\n    Earliness.\r\n    High yield per acre.\r\n    Ease of cultivating and spraying.\r\n    Ease of picking.\r\n    No injury from snails and wire worms.\r\n    Quality of fruit:--size, color, smoothness and cleanliness.\r\n    Crop finished earlier.\r\n    Less sunscald.\r\n\r\nThe disadvantages claimed are:\r\n\r\n    Many plants required.\r\n    Reduced yield.\r\n    More blossom-end rot.\r\n    Higher cost of labor.\r\n    Cost and care of stakes and wire.\r\n\r\nThe validity of each of these points varies greatly with conditions;\r\nin fact, the answer to the whole question depends largely upon the\r\nlocation and the ideas of the grower. In trying to reach a\r\nconclusion, it is well to realize that training makes certain\r\nradical changes in the plant. It loses leaves through pruning, it is\r\nsupported from the ground, and it is spaced differently. Since the\r\nleaves manufacture the basic substance for themselves, and for the\r\nrest of the plant, removal of leaves reduces the resources of the\r\nplant. H. C. Thompson[17] has found that the root system is reduced\r\nabout in proportion to leaf reduction. It is fairly clear that\r\nsingle-stem training greatly reduces the yield per plant, and other\r\nmethods result similarly in proportion to the severity of pruning.\r\nWhen plants are spaced closely enough together the yield may be\r\nbrought up to that of areas unpruned and unstaked. Idaho experiments\r\nindicate that staking alone does not affect the total yield, but\r\nthat it does favor early maturity under the different pruning\r\nsystems. The disadvantages of training are largely economic. Will\r\nthe marketing conditions justify the extra cost of staking and\r\npruning?\r\n\r\nExperiments have shown pretty clearly that sunscald, blossom-end rot\r\nand cracking are worse on trained plants. Using varieties of good\r\nfoliage will help the first trouble while uniform and adequate water\r\nsupply achieved by selection of suitable land, by building humus\r\ncontent of the soil and by irrigation will solve the latter two\r\nproblems. Thompson found increased yield of early fruit. Other\r\nevidence is somewhat conflicting but, in general, it supports\r\nThompson. It is generally agreed that pruned plants yield larger,\r\ncleaner and more perfectly formed and colored fruits. Ease of\r\nspraying or dusting and of picking is important.\r\n\r\nFor pruned plants, 3-1/2 feet between rows and 1-1/2-2 feet between\r\nplants is about right.\r\n\r\nTo train or not to train is a question that one must answer for\r\nhimself as the controlling factors vary too widely--costs of stakes,\r\nwire and labor, prices of early tomatoes and possibility of\r\ncultivating a more or less fancy trade.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n      VII\r\n\r\n      THE ETERNAL BATTLE WITH INSECTS AND DISEASES\r\n\r\n\r\nThe tomato, in most regions, is not one of our most \"pestered\"\r\ncrops. Although over thirty diseases of tomatoes are discussed in\r\nbooks and bulletins, most of them are only occasionally serious or\r\nare subject to definite control methods. Enemies are generally worse\r\nin the warmer climates.\r\n\r\nMost home garden tomatoes and many commercial crops are grown\r\nwithout benefit of spray or dust. If trouble arises, county agent or\r\ncollege specialist can usually advise, suggesting methods suitable\r\nfor local conditions.\r\n\r\nExperience must, of necessity, be the guide in shaping a program and\r\ncosts must be carefully balanced against results.\r\n\r\nThe principal measures that are widely used are seed treatment\r\nagainst damping off, use of resistant strains against fusarium wilt\r\nand application of bordeaux mixture against leaf blights.\r\n\r\nAs with all plants, thoroughness must be the watchword in spraying\r\nor dusting. Timeliness, choice of weather conditions so far as\r\npossible, and covering all surface lightly rather than throwing on\r\nheavy blotches of spray or dust all require careful attention.\r\n\r\n_Fusarium Wilt_ (Fusarium lycopersici) is perhaps the most serious\r\nof all the tomato diseases although it occasions little trouble in\r\nthe more northerly states. It is troublesome as far north as New\r\nJersey to Iowa.\r\n\r\nThe fungus winters in the soil, enters through the roots and blocks\r\nthe water passages of the plant causing wilting, yellowing, and\r\nfinally, death. Water vessels in the stem are discolored,--another\r\nmeans of identifying the disease.\r\n\r\nSpraying or dusting are of no service since the fungus is within.\r\nLong time rotation and use of the many resistant strains are\r\neffective means of control.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 17.--Resistance to fusarium wilt. Row on left\r\ncenter is planted to an ordinary variety, row on right with one of\r\nF. J. Pritchard's wilt-resistant selections. Insert shows plant\r\nattacked by wilt fungus.]\r\n\r\n_Leaf Spot_, _Septoria Blight_ (Septoria lycopersici) causes heavy\r\nloss by destroying the foliage and so the fruit-making power of the\r\nplant. It also opens the fruits to sunscald. The spots appear as\r\nsmall dark water soaked areas which enlarge but little though they\r\nincrease in number and turn brown. Tiny black dots, the fruiting\r\nbodies of the fungus, appear. The spores germinate only on moist\r\nleaves and the disease is spread by wind, rain, workers and the\r\nlike. It winters on refuse of the tomato and related plants.\r\n\r\nFall plowing helps to control. Bordeaux spraying beginning in the\r\nseed bed and carried faithfully through the season will usually hold\r\nthe trouble in check.\r\n\r\n_Late Blight_ (Phytophthora infestans) is the same fungus as the\r\nlate blight of potatoes, affecting both foliage and fruit. It is\r\noften troublesome the first few weeks after plants are set\r\nout-of-doors. Clean soil in seed bed and bordeaux spraying are\r\nhelpful.\r\n\r\n_Western Blight_, _Yellows_, _Curly Top_,--cause unknown,--is\r\nprevalent in California. Leaves roll and become thickened and\r\nbrittle, later turning a sulfury yellow. Veins become purplish. The\r\ntrouble prevails in hot weather. The cause is likely a virus,\r\nsimilar to or identical with the curly top of beets. It is\r\napparently spread by leaf hoppers. No satisfactory control has been\r\ndevised though there is some promise in resistant strains.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 18.--Diseases of the tomato. 1. Septoria or\r\nleaf spot. 2. Mosaic. 3. Mosaic, filiform.]\r\n\r\n_Mosaic._--No organism has been definitely connected with the mosaic\r\ndiseases of tomatoes, but they are highly infectious, being spread\r\nby means of what is called a \"virus,\" which passes the finest\r\nfilters. It is spread by insects, notably aphids, which carry plant\r\njuice, and in the handling of plants, but it does not persist in\r\nseeds or in litter. It is wintered on horse nettles and three\r\nspecies of ground cherries. Control suggestions include roguing\r\naffected plants, eliminating weeds, and controlling carrying\r\ninsects. The symptoms are widely various, the most common being\r\nmottling of leaves, stunting and malformation of leaflets, which\r\nsometimes become fine ribbons or threads, curling, appearance of\r\nsmall brown dead areas, and spots and cracks on fruits.\r\n\r\n_Damping off_ is caused by various fungi in the seed bed which\r\nattack the stem near the surface of the soil and cause the plant to\r\ndrop over and die. Clean soil, heating of soil, commonly called\r\nsterilization, and care in watering are all helpful. It is now\r\ncommon practice to dust seed with formaldehyde dust, or with red\r\ncopper oxid or with an organic mercury disinfectant. If trouble is\r\nserious, a watering with semesan just before seedlings emerge may be\r\nhelpful.\r\n\r\nA government bulletin on \"Market Diseases of Tomatoes\"\r\n(Miscellaneous Publication 121, 1932) is an excellent summary with\r\ncolored plates to help in recognizing the various troubles.\r\n\r\n\r\n      Insects\r\n\r\n_The Fruit Worm_ (Chloridea obsoleta) is probably the worst of the\r\ntomato insects, but is not prevalent in the North. It is the same as\r\nthe corn ear-worm or the cotton boll-worm, and bores into green or\r\nripening fruits. It winters in the soil and fall plowing is\r\nrecommended for its control. Planting corn as a trap crop is also\r\nsuggested. The Virginia Truck Experiment Station finds that the\r\naddition of two pounds of calcium arsenate to 50 gallons of the\r\nBordeaux used for disease control helps materially.\r\n\r\n_Cut-worms_ (various species of the family Noctuidae) cause severe\r\nlosses at the time of field setting. They winter in the soil and are\r\nworse when sod has been plowed under, or following other host\r\nplants. Poison bran mash is commonly used to combat them, using a\r\nspoonful to each plant. Hand picking and the use of paper collars\r\nare resorted to on a small scale. Well-hardened plants seem less\r\nsubject to injury by these pests than tender plants.\r\n\r\n_Colorado Potato Beetle_ (Leptinotarsa decemlineata) can cause a\r\nworld of damage to young plants. Arsenical spray or dust will\r\nordinarily control them. The old-fashioned potato bug (family\r\nMeloidae), is reported as troublesome in Missouri. When they appear\r\nin droves, the only control is to drive them with brush. Arsenical\r\nspray or dust is of some value.\r\n\r\n_Flea Beetles_ (family Chrysomelidae) are the little black jumping\r\nfellows that perforate leaves in plant beds and in the field. They\r\nare also accused of injuring blossoms and reducing the set of fruit.\r\nTheir attacks upon young plants are sometimes ruinous. Bordeaux with\r\narsenical serves as a repellant. Dusting with nicotine sulphate dust\r\nis also suggested.\r\n\r\n_Green Tomato Worms_, or _Horn Worms_ (Phlegethontius sexta) are\r\nbig, green fellows and have a great capacity for tomato foliage.\r\nHand-picking and arsenical spray or dust are usual means of combat.\r\n\r\n_The stalk-borer_ (Papaipema nitela) is a slender caterpillar which\r\nis reported as serious in Indiana. No satisfactory control is\r\nsuggested except clean culture around fields and pinching the stems\r\nto destroy the pest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n      VIII\r\n\r\n      SKILLFUL SELLING CROWNS THE ENTERPRISE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe most skillful production is in vain if marketing is not done\r\nwell. At the same time, the quality of the goods is the principal\r\nfactor in making the price and in moving the goods. Even then, if\r\ncosts in production and marketing are too high, the enterprise is a\r\nfailure.\r\n\r\nThe differences between high and low quotations on the same market\r\nthe same day, are usually fairly wide,--say, $1.75 to $2.50; or\r\n$0.75 to $1.25; or $0.20 to $0.25 per basket. These differences are\r\nsufficient to make the difference between profit and loss. Small\r\ndifferences in quality of the product, in handling and dress-up of\r\nthe market pack and skill in finding buyers may easily result in\r\nprice differences as great or greater than those indicated.\r\n\r\n\r\n      Harvesting\r\n\r\nPicking in the field calls for the closest care and supervision to\r\nprevent damage to the fruits and vines. Stems should be removed to\r\navoid punching other fruits, and long finger-nails do great harm by\r\ncutting the skin and admitting infection. Containers should not be\r\ntoo large to be handled conveniently. Round half-bushel stave\r\nbaskets and galvanized pails are excellent. Baskets made of\r\nquarter-inch staves rather than veneer are smooth and durable, but\r\nthe investment is rather heavy unless dumping is resorted to. In\r\npractice, all sorts of boxes and crates are used, often the package\r\nthat is used for marketing. No container as deep as a bushel basket\r\nshould be used.\r\n\r\nThe stage of ripeness at which tomatoes are picked depends upon the\r\ntime and distance to market. For home use or local market, fruit may\r\nrange from the first turn to almost fully colored.\r\n\r\nA few growers pick at the turn and use ripening rooms to prepare for\r\nlocal selling. In this way cracking, injury by soil, by insects, and\r\nby uneven coloring are avoided. Fruits are wiped and handled with\r\nless loss and may even be washed if need be.\r\n\r\nFully ripened fruit will not stand handling and hauling and will\r\nquickly deteriorate, reaching the consumer in bad condition.\r\n\r\nFor cannery, full ripening is desired with even coloring.\r\nMacGillivray[18] has shown that success in this is largely a matter\r\nof care in picking. Cracking and slight softening are not serious\r\ndefects for this purpose, but molds and bacteria in broken places\r\nare serious as they throw the product out of grade or occasion\r\nrejection.\r\n\r\n\r\n      Picking Green\r\n\r\nMost tomatoes for long distance shipment, are picked before color\r\nappears,--at the mature-green stage. One of the great difficulties\r\nis to judge this stage correctly; to train ordinary labor to pick by\r\nmaturity and not by size. Immature-green tomatoes ripen slowly and\r\ndo not achieve good appearance or table quality.\r\n\r\nIt is almost impossible to describe the ear marks of a mature-green\r\ntomato. Most of those usually cited are of doubtful value--glossy\r\nsurface, whitish cast of color and the dark ring at the stem scar.\r\nThe jelly-like or mucilaginous material in the seed cells has\r\nsufficiently developed in a mature green tomato so that the fruit\r\nmay be sliced without cutting seeds. Of course, the tomato is\r\nruined but the method can be used to check one's judgment based on\r\nthe exterior. Also, one can learn by laying aside tomatoes judged\r\nmature-green and immature-green to ripen.\r\n\r\nSome efforts have recently been made in Florida to pick tomatoes at\r\nthe turn, that is, at the first show of color, a practice suggested\r\nby Sando[19] some years ago. This should provide fruits of uniform\r\ndegree of maturity, that would be about ready to sell on arrival and\r\nit would eliminate the serious problem of immature-greens. It would\r\nrequire more frequent picking of fields and there could be no delay\r\nin packing. There would, doubtless, also be problems of temperature\r\nand ventilation in transit. Results of tests thus far have been\r\nrather encouraging.\r\n\r\n\r\n      Ripening\r\n\r\nGreen wrap tomatoes are received at terminal markets by produce\r\nhouses that have special ripening rooms where temperature is kept at\r\nabout 70 deg., with high humidity to prevent wilting or shriveling.\r\nEthylene gas is used by some to hasten ripening. It does not change\r\nthe nature of the process, merely speeding it up. Some of these\r\nrepackers have elaborate equipment for sorting and packing.\r\n\r\nThe tomatoes, on arrival, are shaken out of their paper wraps. Any\r\nthat have ripened in transit are taken out and packed while the\r\ngreens go into the ripening rooms. They may have to be sorted over\r\ntwo or three times as ripening progresses.\r\n\r\nThe ripening process in tomatoes has been rather thoroughly studied.\r\nSando found that tomatoes ripen uniformly, regardless of size, at a\r\ncertain age, dating from the setting of the fruit. This time, which,\r\nof course, varies according to weather conditions, was eight weeks\r\nwhen the studies were made. Ripening is accompanied by an increase\r\nin moisture, acids and sugars, with decrease of solids, nitrogen,\r\nstarch, pentisans, crude fibre and ash. Sugars increase from about a\r\nquarter to about half of the dry weight. Chemical analysis did not\r\nshow differences sufficient to account for the difference in quality\r\nbetween vine-ripened fruit and green fruit ripened in the\r\nlaboratory. Lack of ventilation seems to be detrimental.\r\n\r\nIt is commonly held that tomatoes chilled without freezing will not\r\nripen satisfactorily afterward. This belief is discounted by results\r\nof Wright and associates and of Platenius who found little effect of\r\nlow temperatures upon later ripening.\r\n\r\nWright[20] and Platenius[21] have both found that tomatoes should\r\nnot be stored at low temperatures, 50 deg. to 60 deg. F. being best. Storage\r\nis not likely to be satisfactory for more than a month.\r\n\r\n\r\n      Waxing\r\n\r\nWaxing of tomatoes by immersion in a dilute water emulsion of\r\nparaffine and carnauba waxes is being tried out with very promising\r\nresults. Waxes are also dissolved in volatile hydrocarbons and\r\nsprayed on. Moisture loss and shriveling are materially retarded,\r\nand interference with the ripening process is negligible. The wax\r\ncoating is very thin, adds an attractive gloss and is entirely\r\nharmless.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 19.--Packing tomatoes on a farm in\r\nConnecticut. Boys in the background are wiping and sorting. The\r\nothers are packing in half-bushel boxes. The top slats are put on\r\nbefore packing and the bottom is nailed on at the finish of the job.\r\nA board which is turned over with the box keeps tomatoes from\r\nfalling out.]\r\n\r\n\r\n      Grading\r\n\r\nIt is generally true that at market the poorest products in a given\r\nlot tend to fix the price. When the buyer finds a few inferior\r\nspecimens he assumes there are many more. Imperfect and diseased\r\nspecimens infect others. Grading enhances the appearance of the\r\npack.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Courtesy Tripak Mach. Service_\r\n\r\nFIGURE 20.--A California packing house with elaborate machinery and\r\nfully organized.]\r\n\r\nOf course, the grower who picks marketable tomatoes and leaves\r\nunmarketable fruits on the vine is engaged in a form of\r\ngrading--informal and subconscious. Methods may range from this\r\nsimple practice to the elaborate schemes adopted in large packing\r\nhouses. There is no difficulty in adopting methods for the farm that\r\nare easily managed and perfectly practical. In general, two grades\r\nto sell represent a good plan, leaving culls at home unless prices\r\nare high and there is good demand for them. The set-up may involve\r\nno more than a worker at a table with three baskets--one with\r\ntomatoes from the field; another for #1's and a third for #2's. The\r\nworker may well use a cotton flannel glove or cloth to wipe the\r\ntomatoes and the fruits should be placed in layers to bring the\r\npackage to a good face. With some practice, this slows the operation\r\nbut very little. Shed packing should be more common than it is\r\nthough the practice seems to be gaining.\r\n\r\nShippers scattered from Cuba and California to New York state have\r\npacking houses set up to all degrees of elaborateness. Some have\r\nmachines and conveyors that wash, sort for size, provide for hand\r\nsorting for grade and deliver to bins for packing. Experienced\r\npackers advance with the season from Florida to Lake Erie. These\r\nworkers become almost incredibly expert and speedy. It is not\r\nuncommon for a worker to pick up, wrap and place in the lug box 60\r\nor 70 tomatoes per minute--not as a show-off but in course of\r\nregular work.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 21.--Puffiness is a common defect in tomatoes,\r\nespecially when grown in the winter in the South.]\r\n\r\nThe federal government has worked out and published standards for\r\nthe grades of tomatoes along with most other vegetables. These\r\nstandards are practical and have found wide acceptance as furnishing\r\ncommon language between seller and buyer, especially for long\r\ndistance shipment. The one who grades may, however, set up a\r\nstandard of his own to meet the needs of his conditions and market.\r\n\r\nU.S. Standards for cannery tomatoes are widely used as a basis of\r\npayment to the grower and this practice is to be commended.\r\n\r\n\r\n      Packaging\r\n\r\nThe lug box has almost wholly replaced the older 6-basket carrier\r\nand 4-basket flat for shipment of tomatoes. It is in almost every\r\nrespect, a good package for tomatoes. It is built with solid board\r\nends, with veneer or sawed sides, bottom and cover. Cleats on the\r\nends serve to raise the lids so that a bulge pack will not be\r\ninjured by pressure. Veneer covers and bottoms are held together by\r\nstitched veneer cross pieces. The lug box is packed in three layers\r\nand holds about 30 pounds net of tomatoes though it is often\r\nover-packed to carry considerably more. The bulge pack is desirable\r\nonly so far as it is necessary to insure a tight pack and to take up\r\nthe small shrinkage that takes place in transit. Ordinarily, it goes\r\nbeyond this. It results in delivery of more tomatoes than are paid\r\nfor, and in bruising because the top center is too high.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Courtesy Southern Arkansas Growers Association_\r\n\r\nFIGURE 22.--The lug box is the most widely used of all tomato\r\npackages. This is well packed and labeled but shows too much bulge\r\nmaking for difficulty in loading and handling and increasing danger\r\nof bruising the upper fruits.]\r\n\r\nThe late M. R. Ensign in Florida, was working with a wire-bound lug\r\nto carry 20 pounds of tomatoes in two layers without bulge.\r\n\r\nThe lug box is packed in three layers and the size of fruits is\r\ndesignated by the number of tomatoes each way,--6 x 6, 6 x 7, and 7\r\nx 7 being the commonest sizes. Each tomato is wrapped in a square of\r\ntissue paper which may or may not be printed. The principal\r\nadvantage of the paper is to cushion the pack and protect the\r\ntomatoes against rubbing and abrasion. Where tomatoes are small,\r\nU.S. Standards provide for \"bridge pack\" or partial extra layers,\r\nfor extra rows and for double wraps or two tomatoes in one paper.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 23.--Lug boxes as loaded in car.]\r\n\r\nLug boxes were formerly loaded lengthwise of the car but are now\r\ngenerally loaded crosswise,--that is, the side of the box is\r\ncrosswise throwing the heavy endwise thrust against the substantial\r\nend of the box. Thin strips are nailed between layers, butting\r\nagainst the sides of the car to prevent shifting of the load and\r\nclosing of ventilation channels. Refrigerated cars are generally\r\nused but icing is not usual.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 24.--The square braid basket is widely used as\r\na local market package for tomatoes. The faced pack looks better and\r\nis easily put up. Covers permit stacking six or eight high.]\r\n\r\nA few shipping sections, notably New Jersey, still use the 12-quart\r\nclimax basket for tomatoes.\r\n\r\nLocal markets use various containers for tomatoes,--the Boston\r\nbushel box; a half bushel of the same depth also used in New\r\nEngland; lug boxes; the Jersey tomato crate; and very commonly, 8\r\nand 12-quart square braid veneer market baskets. Peach baskets and\r\nbushel baskets are now used but little, being too deep for good\r\ncarrying. The diamond market basket of earlier years has about\r\ndisappeared--being too flexible and not suited for stacking. The\r\nsquare braid with suitable cover may be stacked very satisfactorily\r\nin trucks but is hardly substantial enough for rail shipment.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 25.--The Connecticut half bushel box. Figure\r\n19 shows how this is packed.]\r\n\r\nHot house tomatoes travel in square braid, climax or paper fibre\r\nbaskets, now rather commonly, the latter. The Cleveland section\r\nsells some millions of baskets of 8-quart capacity but carrying 8\r\npounds of tomatoes in two layers, usually with stems on, usually\r\nwrapped and sometimes with a paper divider between layers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 26.--Repacked tomatoes. Southern tomatoes go\r\nto wholesale houses that specialize in ripening and repacking. Many\r\nkinds of packages are used. The flat 10-pound box is one of the\r\npopular packs especially in the Boston area.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 27.--Cellulose film is used for repacked\r\ntomatoes.]\r\n\r\nCannery tomatoes move in field crates belonging to the canner or, in\r\nJersey, in 5/8 bushel baskets, about as awkward a container as could\r\nbe readily devised unless it should be the Jersey tomato crate\r\nwith its two cover strips permanently fastened.\r\n\r\nRepack tomatoes are sometimes replaced in lugs or in half lugs. Ten\r\npound corrugated cartons are widely used, newer and fancier packs\r\nbeing but one layer deep. Fruits are wrapped with paper or cellulose\r\nfilm. An increasing proportion of repacks are now put up in\r\none-pound cartons with a window of cellulose film, carrying four or\r\nfive tomatoes. A variation is a paper tray wrapped with cellulose\r\nfilm.\r\n\r\nGood marketing calls for a good label for whatever package is used.\r\nThese are usually pasted on the package. Paper containers are often\r\nprinted directly but the problem of misuse of second hand packages\r\nis coming to the fore.\r\n\r\n\r\n      Selling\r\n\r\nSuccess in selling demands in the producer the qualities which we\r\nordinarily expect in the business man. The good grower is a business\r\nman if he succeeds, and this will be more true in the future than in\r\nthe past, as competition increases. It is necessary to judge the men\r\none deals with, forming estimates as to reliability and character.\r\nMutual confidence is essential to satisfactory dealings. It is worth\r\nwhile to study the produce business and to learn its ins and outs,\r\nreading a trade paper, talking with dealers, and making trips to\r\nmarkets.\r\n\r\nShipments are made on \"f.o.b.\" or track sale, on consignment, or on\r\njoint account. The first plan of outright sale is the most desirable\r\nand is possible where there is enough business at a given point to\r\nattract buyers or where grades and business standing are well enough\r\nestablished to assure the purchaser of what he is getting. When the\r\nquality of the product is uncertain or when markets are glutted,\r\nconsignment must be resorted to. Under this plan, the shipper owns\r\nthe goods until the receiver makes a sale and all the risks up to\r\nthis point are his. There are many consignment houses of high\r\ncharacter if the shipper will take the trouble to find them instead\r\nof shipping to any one who writes a good letter, and there is\r\nvigorous competition in the trade. These factors make it possible to\r\nsecure fairly good service most of the time. Joint account selling,\r\nwhere shipper and receiver agree on how returns shall be divided, is\r\nsometimes undertaken where mutual acquaintance justifies it.\r\n\r\nSelling on distant markets is more complex and difficult than local\r\nselling for many reasons. Shoving crates off the wagon into the car\r\nand forgetting them is not selling. Co-operative organization has\r\nhelped many communities through pooling of resources, standardizing,\r\ngrading and packing the product, encouraging better field practices,\r\nand securing the services of able managers and salesmen.\r\n\r\n\r\n      Local Selling\r\n\r\nA very small amount of produce is sold by producers directly to the\r\nconsumer at his home, but the roadside market has greatly developed\r\nretail activity by growers. Here fine quality, attractive\r\nappearance, moderate prices, and fair dealing are effective in\r\nbuilding business. Stands that plan to \"fleece them as they pass\" do\r\nnot last long. It is the return business that counts. The bulk of\r\nlocal selling is done directly to retailers--grocers or\r\nhucksters--either at market or store-door. The costliness of this\r\nsystem is being realized and local commission business is growing,\r\nin many cases through the establishment of commission houses\r\nco-operatively owned and managed by growers, as in Providence,\r\nCleveland, Chicago and other markets.\r\n\r\nSome effort has been made to increase the use of tomatoes as has\r\nbeen successfully done with oranges and bananas. These efforts have\r\nbeen sporadic and results have been hardly more consistent than the\r\nefforts. Co-operative publicity, especially at times when large\r\nquantities are to be moved, would seem to offer fine possibilities.\r\nGrowers of some crops are finding chain store groups very ready to\r\nhelp in moving out large volumes of produce when the supply is\r\nlarge.\r\n\r\n\r\n      Cannery Selling\r\n\r\nCannery sales are generally made at a stipulated price on contracts\r\nclosed in advance of planting. These contracts have usually devoted\r\nmore words to protecting the interests of the packer than those of\r\nthe grower, largely because the grower has accepted the canner's\r\ninitiative with little question. Farseeing companies have been fair\r\nin enforcement of terms and liberal in their dealings, realizing\r\nthat prosperity must be mutual for the highest success. A few\r\ncanners have contract provisions that enable the grower to share in\r\nprices realized for the packed product when they rise beyond a\r\ncertain figure. Too many canners have lacked vision, however, and\r\nhave taken all they could get. Farmers have known little about costs\r\nand so have frequently been lured by the prospect of cash return\r\neven though they see no money until the packed tomatoes are actually\r\nsold. During recent years, much has been learned about the business\r\nside of growing for cannery purposes and the knowledge has been made\r\navailable through extension channels. Growers have shown some\r\ntendency to organize and some canners welcome this movement as\r\nhelping them to set their affairs on a plane of definite\r\nunderstanding. Canners have suffered sadly through failure of\r\ngrowers to live up to contracts if it suited them better to evade\r\nthe terms, and organization helps greatly to develop the producer's\r\nsense of responsibility. Indiana has formed a federation of locals,\r\nbut an organization movement in another state failed, more because\r\nthe directors and members did not live up to their duties than\r\nthrough opposition of certain hostile canners. Co-operation in this\r\nfield has the same possibilities, requirements and dangers as in\r\nother fields. With time and experience, co-operation will be an\r\nincreasing and beneficial factor in the business.\r\n\r\nIn some sections, most of the cannery tomatoes are sold on open\r\nmarket, and in others, the early part of the crop is free for local\r\nsale or shipment. This arrangement would seem to have possibilities\r\nfor further development by the use of good plants and good culture.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n      IX\r\n\r\n      OPERATING IN THE RED OR IN THE BLACK\r\n\r\n\r\nHappily, the home gardener does not need to keep books with his\r\ntomatoes. If he likes the culture and the product, he need not\r\ninquire further.\r\n\r\nNot so with the commercial grower. After all skill has been\r\nexercised in growing and selling, the books must show black and not\r\nred. This calls for good management and judgment not only as to what\r\nis best for the tomatoes and for the consumer but also how much one\r\ncan afford to spend to gain a given advantage.\r\n\r\nFortunately, quality, yield and economy generally go hand in hand.\r\nOne of the best ways to achieve low unit cost is to win a high yield\r\nper acre.\r\n\r\nFor the cannery crop, conditions are sometimes such that one cannot\r\nafford to apply, say, optimum fertilizer because some other factor\r\nnot readily controlled may limit the returns and so make heavy\r\nfeeding uneconomical.\r\n\r\n_Yield._--The average yield per acre of cannery tomatoes for the\r\nUnited States was, in 1940, 5.39 tons per acre and the 10-year\r\naverage, to 1938, was 4.15 tons per acre. For tomatoes for fresh\r\nmarket, the average yield for 1940 was 148 bushels per acre, 14\r\nbushels above the 10-year average. Of course, these yields would not\r\nsatisfy a grower who calls himself successful. In the canning\r\nsections of New York, it takes about 7 tons per acre to cover costs\r\nof production. Some years ago a survey in Arkansas recorded costs as\r\nlow as $36 per acre. However, the same survey showed cost per ton as\r\n$13.64. Cannery contracts that year averaged about $12.75 per ton.\r\nThat does not yield much money to bank even if ten or twenty acres\r\nare grown. Rarely yields run to 25 tons per acre.\r\n\r\nIt is accordingly necessary to keep costs down and to bring yields\r\nup. Each item of cost must be scrutinized and adjusted to bring\r\nlowest cost per ton or per package.\r\n\r\nIn counting costs, it is necessary to include every element. The\r\nfollowing summary from 118 Western New York farms for 1934 for\r\ncannery tomatoes illustrates the various items:\r\n\r\n    -----------------------------------------------------------\r\n                                         |        | _Per cent_\r\n                                         |        | _of total_\r\n    Growing costs:                       |        |\r\n      Land                               | $ 7.66 |   9.17\r\n      Manure                             |   3.91 |   4.68\r\n      Commercial fertilizer              |   8.21 |   9.83\r\n      Plants                             |  15.55 |  18.62\r\n      Plowing                            |   3.42 |   4.10\r\n      Fitting                            |   3.83 |   4.59\r\n      Applying fertilizer                |   1.65 |   1.98\r\n      Setting                            |   5.41 |   6.48\r\n      Cultivating                        |   6.38 |   7.64\r\n      All other growing costs            |   2.14 |   2.56\r\n                                         |---------------------\r\n            Total growing costs per acre | $58.16 |  69.65\r\n    Harvesting and delivering (8.2 tons) |  25.34 |  30.35\r\n                                         |---------------------\r\n    Total costs                          | $83.50 |100.00\r\n    -----------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nAll too often, growers think they are counting costs when such\r\nimportant items as interest, use of truck and machinery or others\r\nare omitted. One sometimes sees such figures in print.\r\n\r\nOne good way to view returns is in terms of cents per hour for\r\nlabor. Cost accounts in New York have showed that a group of farmers\r\nwho raised cannery tomatoes the nine years up to 1937 and whose\r\nrecords were studied, realized $0.34 per hour for their time given\r\nto tomatoes, $0.51 for potatoes, $0.24 for wheat, and $0.11 for\r\noats.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n      SELECTED REFERENCES\r\n\r\n\r\nThis book is not a monograph in the scientific sense and no attempt\r\nhas been made to cite references for all statements.
