By much the larger portion,\r\nhowever, has been written by the village fireside, after the field-work\r\nof the day was over--a season not the most favourable to any mental\r\nexercise, for weariness of body is apt to beget lassitude of mind. In\r\nshort, were I to say that these Chapters have been as often thrown\r\naside and resumed again as they contain paragraphs, the statement would\r\nprobably not exceed the truth. But the erratic life of an itinerant\r\nstudent of science is attended with yet greater disadvantages. It\r\nentails an absence from all libraries, more especially scientific\r\nones, and the number of works of reference admissible into his _parva\r\nsupellex_ must ever be few indeed. With these hindrances, can the\r\nwriter venture to hope that what has thus been so disjointed and\r\nunconnected to him, will not seem equally so to his readers? Yet if his\r\ndescriptions, written, as it were, face to face with Nature, are found\r\nto have caught some tinge of Nature's freshness, and please the reader\r\nwell enough to set him in the way of becoming a geologist, he shall\r\nhave accomplished all his design.\r\n\r\nIt cannot be too widely known, or too often pressed on the attention,\r\nespecially of the young, that a true acquaintance with science, so\r\ndelightful to its possessors, is not to be acquired at second-hand.\r\nText-books and manuals are valuable only so far as they supplement\r\nand direct our own observations. A man whose knowledge of Nature is\r\nderived solely from these sources, differs about as much from one who\r\nbetakes himself to Nature herself, as a dusty, desiccated mummy does\r\nfrom a living man. You have the same bones and sinews in both; but\r\nin the one they are hard and dry, wholly incapable of action; in the\r\nother they are instinct with freshness and life. He who would know what\r\nphysical science really is, must go out into the fields and learn it\r\nfor himself: and whatever branch he may choose, he will not be long in\r\ndiscovering that a forenoon intelligently spent there must be deemed\r\nof far more worth than days and weeks passed among books. He sees the\r\nobjects of his study with his own eyes, and not through \"the spectacles\r\nof books;\" facts come home to him with a vividness and reality they\r\nnever can possess in the closet; the free buoyant air brightens his\r\nspirits and invigorates his mind, and he returns again to his desk or\r\nhis workshop with a store of new health and pleasure and knowledge.\r\nGeology is peculiarly rich in these advantages, and lies in a manner\r\nopen to all. No matter what may be the season of the year, it offers\r\nalways some material for observation. In the depth of winter we have\r\nthe effects of ice and frost to fall back upon, though the country\r\nshould lie buried in snow; and then when the longer and brighter\r\ndays of spring and summer come round, how easily may the hammer be\r\nbuckled round the waist, and the student emerge from the dust of town\r\ninto the joyous air of the country, for a few delightful hours among\r\nthe rocks; or when autumn returns with its long anticipated holidays,\r\nand preparations are made for a scamper in some distant locality,\r\nhammer and note-book will not occupy much room in the portmanteau,\r\nand will certainly be found most entertaining company. The following\r\npages--forming a digest of the Carboniferous rocks--may, perhaps, in\r\nsome measure, guide the explorations of the observer, by indicating\r\nto him the scope of geological research, the principles on which the\r\nscience rests, and the mode in which it is pursued. But I repeat, no\r\nbook, no lecture-room, no museum, will make a geologist of him. He must\r\naway to the fields and study for himself, and the more he can learn\r\nthere he will become the better geologist.\r\n\r\nHe need not burden himself with accoutrements. A hammer, pretty stout\r\nin its dimensions, with a round blunt face and a flat sharp tail; a\r\nnote-book and a good pocket-lens, are all he needs to begin with.\r\nHaving these, let him seek to learn the general characters' of the\r\nmore common rocks, aiding himself, where he can, by a comparison with\r\nthe specimens of a museum, or, failing that, with the descriptions of\r\na text-book. Let him then endeavour to become acquainted with some of\r\nthe more characteristic fossils of the district in which he resides,\r\nso as to be able to recognise them wherever they occur. Private\r\ncollections and local museums are now becoming comparatively common,\r\nand these, where accessible, will aid him vastly in his studies. Having\r\nat length mastered the more abundant rocks and organic remains of his\r\nneighbourhood, let him try to trace out the connexion of the different\r\nstrata across the country, so as to understand its structure. For\r\nthis purpose it will be necessary to examine every ravine and natural\r\nexposure of the rocks, along with quarries, ditches, railway-cuttings,\r\nand, in short, the whole surface of the district. A general notion\r\nof the geology of the place will, not perhaps be of very difficult\r\nattainment; and this done, the observer should attempt to put down\r\nthe connexion of the rocks on paper, for till this is accomplished he\r\nwill have at the best but an imperfect, and perhaps incorrect notion\r\nof the subject. The best map of the district should be obtained, also\r\na clinometer, or instrument for ascertaining the angle at which rocks\r\n_dip_ with the horizon, and a pocket-compass with which to mark the\r\ndirection of the _dip_ and _strike_ of strata, that is, the _outcrop_,\r\nor line which they form when they come to the surface. Thus armed, he\r\nmay commence a geological survey of his neighbourhood. Wherever he\r\nsees a bed of rock exposed, it should be marked down on his map with\r\nan arrow pointing to the direction in which the stratum is dipping,\r\nthe angle of dip, ascertained by the clinometer, being put alongside.\r\nThe nature of the rock, whether sandstone, shale, limestone, or\r\ngreenstone, must be set down at the same place, and, to save room,\r\na system of marks for the different rocks may be conveniently used.\r\nWhen a sufficient area of ground has been thus traversed, the student\r\nmay find, say a row of arrows on his map all pointing due west, and\r\nindicating a set of quarries about a quarter of a mile distant from one\r\nanother, the rock in each of them dipping to the west. If there be at\r\nthe one end a limestone containing certain fossils, and at the other\r\nend a stratum exactly similar, containing the same fossils, while the\r\nquarries between display the same rock, he will infer, of course, that\r\nthe whole is one limestone, and will accordingly draw a line from the\r\nlast quarry on the north to the last on the south, connecting them all\r\ntogether. If the bed dips steeply down, the line will be narrower,--if\r\nbut slightly inclined, it will be broader; the breadth of such a line\r\n(which may be coloured to taste) always varying with the thickness\r\nof the stratum and the angle which it makes with the horizon. In a\r\ndistrict where faults and curvatures along with trap-rocks abound, the\r\nmapping becomes more complex, but the principle remains the same--a\r\ncurved stratum on the ground making a similarly curved band on the map,\r\nand a fault or dislocation of a set of beds producing, in the same way,\r\na corresponding break in the lines traced. In short, a geological map\r\nshould be as far as possible a transcript of the surface rocks of a\r\ncountry. The beginner should avoid, however, attempting too much; it\r\nwill be enough for him at first to have mastered the leading features\r\nof the geology of his district; the details cannot be shown save on\r\na map of a large scale, and are better transferred to his note-book.\r\nThe use of such mapping is to enable us to gain a correct knowledge of\r\nthe geological structure of a country, and of the relation of rocks to\r\neach other as regards age, origin, &c. Bacon tells us that \"writing\r\nmakes an exact man;\" we may say with equal truth that mapping makes\r\nan exact geologist. It is sometimes easy enough to obtain a notion of\r\nthe general character of a district by taking a few rambles across it;\r\nbut we can never know it thoroughly until we have mapped it. And this\r\nis done not as mere dry routine, or by a series of hard uninteresting\r\nrules. In reading off the geological structure of a country, we\r\nascertain its history during many thousand ages long prior to that\r\nof man. We become, as it were, interpreters of hieroglyphics, and\r\nhistorians of long-perished dynasties.\r\n\r\nThose who have had experience of field-geology, know how vain it is\r\nto attempt to compress into a page or two the results of years, and\r\nthat a few vague general directions are about the utmost that can be\r\nattempted. The practice of the science cannot be taught in books, far\r\nless in prefaces, neither can it be learned from them. And so I once\r\nmore repeat the advice: Get away to the fields. Seek to decipher the\r\ngeological records for yourself, and look with your own eyes into the\r\nlong series of ages whose annals lie inscribed among the rocks. If you\r\ncan secure the co-operation of a few companions, so much the better.\r\nHalf-a-dozen hammers zealously at work in a richly fossiliferous\r\nstratum will soon pile up a tolerable collection of its treasures. But\r\nwhether singly or in company, use your eyes and your hammer, and even\r\nthough in the end you should never become a geologist, you will in the\r\nmeantime gain health and vigour, and a clearness of observation, that\r\nwill stand you in good stead through life.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nPAGE\r\n\r\n  Scene near Colinton in midsummer--A grey travelled

    aspect and contents--Its story of the past.\r\n\r\nThree miles to the south-west of Edinburgh, and not many hundred yards\r\nfrom the sequestered village of Colinton, there is a ravine, overshaded\r\nby a thick growth of beech and elm, and traversed beneath by a stream,\r\nwhich, rising far away among the southern hills, winds through the\r\nrich champaign country of Mid-Lothian. It is, at all seasons of the\r\nyear, one of the most picturesque nooks in the county. I have seen it\r\nin the depth of winter--the leafless boughs doddered and dripping, the\r\nrocks dank and bare save where half-hidden by the rotting herbage, and\r\nthe stream, red and swollen, roaring angrily down the glen, while the\r\nfamilies, located along its banks, fleeing in terror to the higher\r\ngrounds, had left their cottages to the mercy of the torrent. The last\r\ntime I visited the place was in the heart of June, and surely never did\r\nwoodland scene appear more exquisitely beautiful. The beech trees were\r\nin full leaf, and shot their silvery boughs in slender arches athwart\r\nthe dell, intertwining with the broader foliage and deeper green of\r\nthe elm, and the still darker spray of the stately fir. The rocks on\r\neither side were tapestried with verdure; festoons of ivy, with here\r\nand there a thread of honey-suckle interwoven, hung gracefully from the\r\ncliffs overhead; each projecting ledge had its tuft of harebells, or\r\nspeedwell, or dog-violets, with their blue flowers peeping out of the\r\nmoss and lichens; the herb-robert trailed its red blossoms over crag\r\nand stone; the wood-sorrel nestled its bright leaves and pale flowerets\r\namong the gnarled roots of beech and elm; while high over all, alike on\r\nthe rocks above and among the ferns below, towered the gently drooping\r\nstalks of the fox-glove. The stream, almost gone, scarcely broke the\r\nstillness with a low drowsy murmur, as it sauntered on among the\r\n_lapides adesos_ of its pebbly channel. Horace's beautiful lines found\r\nagain their realization:--\r\n\r\n    \"Qua pinus ingens, albaque populus\r\n    Umbram hospitalem consociare amant\r\n        Ramis, et obliquo laborat\r\n            Lympha fugax trepidare rivo.\" [1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1:\r\n\r\n    Where the tall pine and poplar pale\r\n    Delight to cast athwart the vale\r\n        A pleasing shade.\r\n    While the clear stream low murmuring bells.\r\n    And o'er its winding channel toils\r\n        Adown the glade.--A. G.\r\n]\r\n\r\nIt was noon, and the sun shone more brightly and with greater heat\r\nthan had been felt for years. The air, heavy and warm, induced a\r\nfeeling of listlessness and languor, and the day seemed one for which\r\nthe only appropriate employment would have been to read once again\r\nthe \"Castle of Indolence.\" But failing that, I found it pleasant to\r\nwatch the flickering light shot in fitful gleams through the thick\r\ncanopy of leaves, and thus, in the coolness of the shade, to mark\r\nthese rays--sole messengers from the sweltering world around--as they\r\ndanced from rock to stream, now lighting up the ripples that curled\r\ndreamily on, now chequering some huge boulder that lay smooth and\r\npolished in mid-channel, anon glancing playfully among the thickets\r\nof briar or honeysuckle and vanishing in the shade. Sometimes a\r\nwagtail would alight at hand, or a bee drone lazily past, while even\r\nan occasional butterfly would venture down into this shady covert.\r\nBut, with these exceptions, the animal creation seemed to have gone to\r\nsleep, an example which it was somewhat difficult to avoid following.\r\nWhile thus idly engaged, my eye rested on a large boulder on the\r\nopposite side. It lay partly imbedded in a stiff clay, and partly\r\nprotruding from the surface of the bank some way above the stream.\r\nA thick arbour of leafage overhung it, through which not even the\r\nfaintest ray of sunshine could force its way. The spot seemed cooler\r\nand more picturesque than that which I occupied, and so, crossing the\r\nwell-nigh empty channel, I climbed the bank and was soon seated on the\r\nboulder. A stout hammer is a constant companion in my rambles, and was\r\nsoon employed on this occasion in chipping almost unconsciously the\r\nnewly-acquired seat. The action was, perhaps, deserving of the satire\r\nof Wordsworth's Solitary:--\r\n\r\n          \"You may trace him oft\r\n    By scars, which his activity has left\r\n    Beside our roads and pathways, though, thank Heaven!\r\n    This covert nook reports not of his hand.\r\n    He, who with pocket-hammer smites the edge\r\n    Of luckless rock or prominent stone, disguised\r\n    In weather-stains, or crusted o'er by Nature\r\n    With her first growths, detaching by the stroke\r\n    A chip or splinter to resolve his doubts;\r\n    And, with that ready answer satisfied,\r\n    The substance classes by some barbarous name,\r\n    And hurries on; or from the fragments picks\r\n    His specimen; if but imply interveined\r\n    With sparkling mineral, or should crystal cube\r\n    Lurk in its cells and thinks himself enriched.\r\n    Wealthier, and doubtless wiser, than before!\"\r\n\r\nThere was nothing in the distant aspect of the boulder to attract\r\nattention. It was just such a mass as dozens of others all round. Nor,\r\non closer inspection, might anything peculiar have been observed. It\r\nhad an irregularly oblong form, about two or three feet long, and half\r\nas high. Ferns and herbage were grouped around it, the wood-sorrel\r\nclustered up its sides, and little patches of moss and lichen nestled\r\nin its crevices. And yet, withal, there was something about it that,\r\nere long, riveted my attention. I examined it minutely from one end to\r\nthe other, and from top to bottom. The more I looked the more did I see\r\nto interest me; and when, after a little labour, some portions of its\r\nupper surface were detached, my curiosity was abundantly gratified.\r\nThat grey lichened stone, half hid among foliage, and unheeded by any\r\nhuman being, afforded me material for a pleasant forenoon's thought.\r\nWill my reader accept an expanded narrative of my reverie?\r\n\r\nI can almost anticipate a smile. \"What can there be remarkable in such\r\na grey stone, hidden in a wood, and of which nobody knows anything?\r\nIt never formed part of any ancient building; it marks the site of\r\nno event in the olden time; it is linked with nothing in the history\r\nof our country. What of interest, then, can it have for us?\" Nay, I\r\nreply, you are therein mistaken. It is, assuredly, linked with the\r\nhistory of our country--it does mark the passing of many a historical\r\nevent long ere human history began; and, though no tool ever came upon\r\nit, it did once form part of a building that rose under the finger of\r\nthe Almighty during the long ages of a bygone eternity. To change the\r\nfigure, this boulder seemed like a curious volume, regularly paged,\r\nwith a few extracts from older works. Bacon tells us that \"some books\r\nare to be tasted, others to be swallowed, and some few to be chewed and\r\ndigested.\" Of the last honour I think the boulder fully worthy, and if\r\nthe reader will accompany me, I shall endeavour to show him how the\r\nprocess was attempted by me.\r\n\r\nThe rock consisted of a hard grey sandstone finely laminated above,\r\nand getting pebbly and conglomeritic below. The included pebbles were\r\nwell worn, and belonged to various kinds of rock. The upper part of\r\nthe block was all rounded, smoothed, and deeply grooved, and, when\r\nsplit open, displayed numerous stems and leaflets of plants converted\r\ninto a black coaly substance. These plants were easily recognisable\r\nas well-known organisms of the carboniferous strata, and it became\r\naccordingly evident that the boulder was a block of carboniferous\r\nsandstone. The pebbles below, however, must have been derived from\r\nmore ancient rocks, and they were thus seen to represent some older\r\ngeological formation. In this grey rock, therefore, there could at\r\nonce be detected well-marked traces of at least two widely-separated\r\nages. The evidence for each was indubitable, and the chronology of\r\nthe whole mass could not be mistaken. The surface striation bore\r\nundoubted evidence of the glacial period, the embedded plants as\r\nplainly indicated the far more ancient era of the coal-measures, while\r\nthe pebbles of the base pointed, though dimly, to some still more\r\nprimeval age. I had here, as it were, a quaint, old, black-letter\r\nvolume of the middle ages, giving an account of events that were\r\ntaking place at the time it was written, and containing on its earlier\r\npages numerous quotations from authors of antiquity. The scratched\r\nsurface, to complete the simile, may be compared to this old work\r\ndone up in a modern binding. Let us, then, first of all, look for a\r\nlittle at the exterior of the volume, and inquire into the origin of\r\nthat strangely-striated surface, and of the clay in which the boulder\r\nrested.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Exterior of the boulder--Travelled stones a difficult problem--Once\r\n       referred to the Deluge--Other theories--Novelty of the true\r\n       solution--Icebergs formed in three ways--Progress and scenery\r\n       of an iceberg--Its effects--Size of icebergs--Boulder-clay\r\n       had a glacial origin--This explanation confirmed by fossil\r\n       shells--Laws of the distribution of life--Deductions.\r\n\r\nHas the reader, when wandering up the course of a stream, rod in hand\r\nperhaps, ever paused at some huge rounded block of gneiss or granite\r\ndamming up the channel, and puzzled himself for a moment to conjecture\r\nhow it could get there? Or when rolling along in a railway carriage,\r\nthrough some deep cutting of sand, clay, and gravel, did the question\r\never obtrude itself how such masses of water-worn material came into\r\nexistence? Did he ever wonder at the odd position of some huge grey\r\nboulder, far away among the hills, arrested as it were on the steep\r\nslope of a deep glen, or perched on the edge of a precipitous cliff, as\r\nthough a push with the hand would hurl it down into the ravine below?\r\nOr did he ever watch the operations of the quarryman, and mark, as each\r\nspadeful of soil was removed, how the surface of the rock below was all\r\nsmoothed, and striated, and grooved?\r\n\r\nThese questions, seemingly simple enough, involve what was wont to\r\nbe one of the greatest problems of geology, and not many years have\r\nelapsed since it was solved. The whole surface of the country was\r\nobserved to be thickly covered with a series of clays, gravels, and\r\nsands, often abounding in rounded masses of rock of all sizes up to\r\nseveral yards in diameter. These deposits were seen to cover all\r\nthe harder rocks, and to occur in a very irregular manner, sometimes\r\nheaped up into great mounds, and sometimes entirely wanting. They were\r\nevidently the results of no agency visible now, either on the land\r\nor around our coasts. They had an appearance rather of tumultuous\r\nand violent action, and so it was wisely concluded that they must be\r\ntraces of the great deluge. The decision had at least this much in its\r\nfavour, it was thoroughly orthodox, and accordingly received marked\r\napprobation, more especially from those who wished well to the young\r\nscience of geology, but were not altogether sure of its tendencies.\r\nBut, alas! this promising symptom very soon vanished. As observers\r\nmultiplied, and investigations were carried on in different countries,\r\nthe truth came out that these clays and gravels were peculiarly a\r\nnorthern formation; that they did not appear to exist in the south of\r\nFrance, Italy, Asia Minor, Syria, and the contiguous countries. If,\r\nthen, they originated from the rushing of the diluvian waters, these\r\nsouthern lands must have escaped the catastrophe, and the site of the\r\nplains of Eden would have to be sought somewhere between the Alps\r\nand the North Pole. This, of course, shocked all previous ideas of\r\ntopography; it was accordingly agreed, at least among more thoughtful\r\nmen, that with these clays and sands the deluge could have had nothing\r\nto do.\r\n\r\nOther theories speedily sprang up, endeavouring to account for the\r\nphenomena by supposing great bodies of water rushing with terrific\r\nforce across whole continents, sweeping away the tops of hills,\r\ntearing up and dispersing entire geological formations, and strewing\r\nthe ocean-bottom with scattered debris. But this explanation had the\r\ndisadvantage of being woefully unphilosophical and not very clearly\r\northodox. Such debacles did not appear to have ever taken place in\r\nany previous geologic era, and experience was against them. Besides,\r\nthey did not account for some of the most evident characteristics of\r\nthe phenomena, such as the northern character of the formation, the\r\nlong parallel striations of the rock surfaces, and the perching of\r\nhuge boulders on lofty hills, often hundreds of miles distant from the\r\nparent rock. Geologists were completely at fault, and the boulder-clay\r\nremained a mystery for years.\r\n\r\nWhen we consider the physical aspects of the countries where the\r\nquestion was studied, we cannot much wonder that the truth was so hard\r\nto find. In the midst of corn-fields and meadows, one cannot readily\r\nrealize the fact that the spot where they stand has been the site of\r\na wide-spread sea; and that where now villages and green lanes meet\r\nthe eye, there once swam the porpoise and the whale, or monsters of\r\na still earlier creation, unwieldy in bulk and uncouth in form. Such\r\nchanges, however, must have been, for their traces meet us on every\r\nhand. We have the sea dashing against our shores, and there seems\r\nnothing at all improbable in the assertion that once it dashed against\r\nour hill-tops. No one, therefore, has any difficulty in giving such\r\nstatements his implicit belief. But who could have dreamed that these\r\nfields, so warm and sunny, were once sealed in ice, and sunk beneath\r\na sea that was cumbered with many a wandering iceberg? Who could have\r\nimagined, that down these glens, now carpeted with heath and harebell,\r\nthe glacier worked its slow way amid the stillness of perpetual snow?\r\nAnd yet strange as it may seem, such is the true solution of the\r\nproblem. The boulder-clay was formed during the slow submergence of our\r\ncountry beneath an icy sea, and the rock-surfaces owe their polished\r\nand striated appearance to the grating across them of sand and stones\r\nfrozen into the bottom of vast icebergs, that drifted drearily from the\r\nnorth. That we may the better see how these results have been effected,\r\nlet us glance for a little at the phenomena observable in northern\r\nlatitudes at the present day.\r\n\r\nIcebergs are formed in three principal ways:--1st, By glaciers\r\ndescending to the shore, and being borne seawards by land-winds; 2d,\r\nBy river-ice packed during spring, when the upper reaches of the rivers\r\nbegin to thaw; 3d, By coast-ice.\r\n\r\nI. There is an upper stratum of the atmosphere characterized by intense\r\ncold, and called the region of perpetual snow. It covers the earth\r\nlike a great arch, the two ends resting, one on the arctic, the other\r\non the antarctic zone, while the centre, being about 16,000 feet above\r\nthe sea,[2] rises directly over the tropics. Wherever a mountain is\r\nsufficiently lofty to pierce this upper stratum, its summit is covered\r\nwith snow, and, as the snow never melts, it is plain that, from the\r\naccumulations of fresh snow-drifts, the mountain-tops, by gradually\r\nincreasing in height and width, would become the supporting columns\r\nof vast hills of ice, which, breaking up at last from their weight\r\nand width, would roll down the mountain-sides and cover vast areas\r\nof country with a ruin and desolation more terrible than that of any\r\navalanche. Olympus would really be superposed upon Ossa. By a beautiful\r\narrangement this undue growth is prevented, so that the hill-tops\r\nnever vary much in height above the sea. The cone of ice and snow\r\nwhich covers the higher part of the mountain, sends down into each of\r\nthe diverging valleys a long sluggish stream of ice, with a motion so\r\nslow as to be almost imperceptible. These streams are called glaciers.\r\nAs they creep down the ravines and gorges, blocks of rock detached\r\nby the frosts from the cliffs above, fall on the surface of the ice,\r\nand are slowly carried along with it. The bottom also of the glaciers\r\nis charged with sand, gravel, and mud, produced by the slow-crushing\r\nmovement; large rocky masses become eventually worn down into\r\nfragments, and the whole surface of the hard rock below is traversed\r\nby long parallel grooves and striæ in the direction of the glacier's\r\ncourse. Among the Alps, the lowest point to which the glacier descends\r\nis about 8500 feet. There the temperature gets too high to allow of its\r\nfurther progress, and so it slowly melts away, choking up the valleys\r\nwith piles of rocky fragments called moraines, and 'giving rise to\r\nnumerous muddy streams that traverse the valleys, uniting at length\r\ninto great rivers such as the Rhone, which enters the Lake of Geneva\r\nturbid and discoloured with glacial mud.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: The average height of the snow-line within the tropics\r\nis 15,207 feet, but it varies according to the amount of land and sea\r\nadjacent, and other causes. Thus, among the Bolivian Andes, owing to\r\nthe extensive radiation, and the ascending currents of air from the\r\nneighbouring plains and valleys, the line stands at a level of 18,000\r\nfeet, while, on mountains near Quito, that is, immediately on the\r\nequatorial line, the lowest level is 15,795.--See Mrs. Somerville's\r\n_Physical Geography_, 4th edit. p. 314.]\r\n\r\nIn higher latitudes, where the lower limit of the snow-line descends to\r\nthe level of the sea, the glaciers are often seen protruding from the\r\nshore, still laden with blocks that have been carried down from valleys\r\nfar in the interior. The action of storms and tides is sufficient to\r\ndetach large masses of the ice, which then floats off, and is often\r\nwafted for hundreds of miles into temperate regions, where it gradually\r\nmelts away. Such floating islands are known as icebergs.\r\n\r\nII. In climates such as that of Canada, where the winters are very\r\nsevere, the rivers become solidly frozen over, and, if the frost be\r\nintense enough, a cake of ice forms at the bottom. In this way sand,\r\nmud, and rocky fragments strewing the banks or the channel of the\r\nstream, are firmly enclosed. When spring sets in, and the upper parts\r\nof the rivers begin to thaw, the swollen waters burst their wintry\r\ninteguments, and the ice is then said to _pack_. Layer is pushed\r\nover layer, and mass heaped upon mass, until great floes are formed.\r\nThese have often the most fantastic shapes, and are borne down by the\r\ncurrent, dropping, as they go, the mud and boulders, with which they\r\nare charged, until they are stranded along some coast line, or melt\r\naway in mid-ocean.\r\n\r\nIII. But icebergs are also produced by the freezing of the water of\r\nthe ocean. In high latitudes, this takes place when the temperature\r\nfalls to 28·5° of Fahrenheit. The surface of the sea then parts with its\r\nsaline ingredients, and takes the form of a sheet of ice, which, by\r\nthe addition of successive layers, augmented sometimes by snow-drifts,\r\noften reaches a height of from thirty to forty feet. On the approach of\r\nsummer these ice-fields break up, crashing into fragments with a noise\r\nlike the thundering of cannon. The disparted portions are then carried\r\ntowards the equator by currents, and may be encountered by hundreds\r\nfloating in open sea. Their first form is flat, but, as they travel on,\r\nthey assume every variety of shape and size.\r\n\r\nOn the shores of brackish seas, such as the Baltic, or along a coast\r\nwhere the salt water is freshened by streams or snow-drifts from the\r\nland, sheets of ice also frequently form during severe frosts. Sand and\r\nboulders are thus frozen in, especially where a layer of ice has formed\r\nupon the sea-bottom.[3] The action of gales or of tides is sufficient\r\nto break up these masses, which are then either driven ashore and\r\nfrozen in a fresh cake of ice, or blown away to sea. The bergs formed\r\nin this way have originally a low flat outline, and many extend as\r\nice-fields over an area of many miles, while, at a later time, they may\r\nbe seen towering precipitously as great hills, some 200 or 300 feet\r\nhigh.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: I was informed by the late Mr. Hugh Miller, that a seam\r\nof shale abounding in liassic fossils, had been found intercalated\r\namong the boulder-clay beds in the vicinity of Eathie. He explained its\r\noccurrence there by supposing that it had formed a reef along a shore\r\nwhere ground-ice was forming; and so having been firmly frozen in, it\r\nwas torn up on the breaking of the ice, and deposited at a distance\r\namong the mud at the sea-bottom.]\r\n\r\nFew sights in nature are more imposing than that of the huge,\r\nsolitary iceberg, as, regardless alike of wind and tide, it steers\r\nits course across the face of the deep far away from land. Like one\r\nof the \"Hrim-thursar,\" or Frost-giants of Scandinavian mythology,[4]\r\nit issues from the portals of the north armed with great blocks of\r\nstone. Proudly it sails on. The waves that dash in foam against its\r\nsides shake not the strength of its crystal walls, nor tarnish the\r\nsheen of its emerald caves. Sleet and snow, storm and tempest, are its\r\ncongenial elements. Night falls around, and the stars are reflected\r\ntremulously from a thousand peaks, and from the green depths of\r\n\"caverns measureless to man.\" Dawn again arises, and the slant rays of\r\nthe rising sun gleam brightly on every projecting crag and pinnacle,\r\nas the berg still floats steadily on; yet, as it gains more southern\r\nlatitudes, what could not be accomplished by the united fury of the\r\nwaves, is slowly effected by the mildness of the climate. The floating\r\nisland becomes gradually shrouded in mist and spume, streamlets\r\neverywhere trickle down its sides, and great crags ever and anon fall\r\nwith a sullen plunge into the deep. The mass becoming top-heavy,\r\nreels over, exposing to light rocky fragments still firmly imbedded.\r\nThese, as the ice around them gives way, are dropped one by one into\r\nthe ocean, until at last the iceberg itself melts away, the mists are\r\ndispelled, and sunshine once more rests upon the dimpled face of the\r\ndeep.[5] If, however, before this final dissipation, the wandering\r\nisland should be stranded on some coast, desolation and gloom are\r\nspread over the country for leagues. The sun is obscured, and the air\r\nchilled; the crops will not ripen; and, to avoid the horrors of famine,\r\nthe inhabitants are fain to seek some more genial locality until the\r\nice shall have melted away; and months may elapse before they can\r\nreturn again to their villages.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: The account of the origin of these giants, as given in\r\nthe prose _Edda_, is very graphic, and may be not inaptly quoted\r\nhere:--\"When the rivers that are called Elivagar had flowed far from\r\ntheir sources,\" replied Har, \"the venom which they rolled along;\r\nhardened, as does dross that runs from a furnace, and became ice.\r\nWhen the rivers flowed no longer, and the ice stood still, the vapour\r\narising from the venom gathered over it and froze to rime; and in this\r\nmanner were formed in Ginnungagap many layers of congealed vapour,\r\npiled one over the other.\"--\"That part of Ginnungagap,\" added Jafnhar,\r\n\"that lies towards the north, was thus filled with heavy masses of\r\ngelid vapour and ice, whilst everywhere within were whirlwinds and\r\nfleeting mists. But the southern part of Ginnungagap was lighted by\r\nthe sparks and flakes that flew into it from Muspellheim.... When the\r\nheated blast met the gelid vapour, it melted into drops, and, by the\r\nmight of him who sent the heat, these drops quickened into life, and\r\ntook a human semblance. The being thus formed was named Ymir, from whom\r\ndescend the race of the Frost-giants (Hrim-thursar), as it is said in\r\nthe Völuspá, 'From Vidolph came all witches; from Vilmeith all wizards;\r\nfrom Svarthöfdi all poison-seekers; and all giants from Ymir.'\"--See\r\nMallet's _Northern Antiquities_, edit. Bohn, p. 402.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: That beautiful expression of Æschylus occurs to me, so\r\nimpossible adequately to clothe in English: ἁνηριθμον γελασμα κυματων.\r\nWho that has spent a calm summer day upon the sea, has not realized its\r\nforce and delicate beauty?]\r\n\r\nThe iceberg melts away, but not without leaving well-marked traces of\r\nits existence. If it disappear in mid-ocean, the mud and boulders, with\r\nwhich it was charged, are scattered athwart the sea-bottom. Blocks\r\nof stone may thus be carried across profound abysses, and deposited\r\nhundreds of miles from the parent hill; and it should be noticed, that\r\nthis is the only way, so far as we know, in which such a thing could\r\nbe effected. Great currents could sweep masses of rock down into deep\r\ngulfs, but could not sweep them up again, far less repeat this process\r\nfor hundreds of miles. Such blocks could only be transported by being\r\nlifted up at the one place and set down at the other; and the only\r\nagent we know of, capable of carrying such a freight, is the iceberg.\r\nIn this way, the bed of the sea in northern latitudes must be covered\r\nwith a thick stratum of mud and sand, plentifully interspersed with\r\nboulders of all sizes, and its valleys must gradually be filled up as\r\nyear by year the deposit goes on.\r\n\r\nBut this is not all. The visible portion of an iceberg is only about\r\none-ninth part of the real bulk of the whole mass, so that if one be\r\nseen 100 feet high, its lowest peak may perhaps be away down 800 feet\r\nbelow the waves. Now it is easy to see that such a moving island will\r\noften grate across the summit and along the sides of submarine hills;\r\nand when the lower part of the berg is roughened over with earth and\r\nstones, the surface of the rock over which it passes will be torn up\r\nand dispersed, or smoothed and striated, while the boulders imbedded in\r\nthe ice will be striated in turn.\r\n\r\nBut some icebergs have been seen rising 300 feet over the sea; and\r\nthese, if their submarine portions sank to the maximum depth,\r\nmust have reached the enormous total height of 2700 feet--that is,\r\nrather higher than the Cheviot Hills.[6] By such a mass, any rock or\r\nmountain-top existing 2400 feet below the surface of the ocean would be\r\npolished and grooved, and succeeding bergs depositing mud and boulders\r\nupon it, this smoothed surface might be covered up and suffer no change\r\nuntil the ocean-bed should be slowly upheaved to the light of day.\r\nIn this way, submarine rock surfaces at all depths, from the coast\r\nline down to 2000 or 3000 feet, may be scratched and polished, and\r\neventually entombed in mud.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 6: In the _American Journal of Science_ for 1843, p.\r\n155, mention is made of an iceberg aground on the Great Bank of\r\nNewfoundland. The average depth of the water was about 500 feet, and\r\nthe visible portion of the berg from 50 to 70 feet high, so that its\r\ntotal height must have been little short of 600 feet, of which only a\r\n_tenth_ part remained above water.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 1. Iceberg grating along the sea-bottom and\r\ndepositing mud and boulders.]\r\n\r\nAnd such has been the origin of the deep clay, which, with its included\r\nand accompanying boulders, covers so large a part of our country. When\r\nthis arctic condition of things began, the land must have been slowly\r\nsinking beneath the sea; and so, as years rolled past, higher and yet\r\nhigher zones of land were brought down to the sea-level, where floating\r\nice, coming from the north-west, stranded upon the rocks, and scored\r\nthem all over as it grated along. This period of submergence may have\r\ncontinued until even the highest peak of the Grampians disappeared,\r\nand, after suffering from the grinding action of ice-freighted rocks,\r\neventually lay buried in mud far down beneath a wide expanse of sea,\r\nover which there voyaged whole argosies of bergs. When the process of\r\nelevation began, the action of waves and currents would tend greatly to\r\nmodify the surface of the glacial deposit of mud and boulders, as the\r\nocean-bed slowly rose to the level of the coast line. In some places\r\nthe muddy envelope was removed, and the subjacent rock laid bare,\r\nall polished and grooved. In other localities, currents brought in a\r\ncontinual supply of sand, or washed off the boulder mud and sand, and\r\nthen re-deposited them in irregular beds; hence resulted those local\r\ndeposits of stratified sand and gravel so frequently to be seen resting\r\nover the boulder clay. At length, by degrees, the land emerged from the\r\nsea, yet glaciers still capped its hills and choked its valleys; but\r\neventually a warmer and more genial climate arose, plants and animals,\r\nsuch as those at present amongst us, and some, such as the wolf, no\r\nlonger extant, were ere long introduced; and eventually, as lord of the\r\nwhole, man took his place upon the scene.[7]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 7: The reader who wishes to enter more fully into the\r\ngeological effects of icebergs, should consult the suggestive section\r\non that subject in De la Beche's _Geological Observer_; also the\r\n_Principles_ and _Visit to the United Stales_ of Sir Charles Lyell,\r\nwith the various authorities referred to by these writers.]\r\n\r\nIt is pleasant to mark, when once the true solution of a difficulty is\r\nobtained, how all the discordant elements fall one by one into order,\r\nand how every new fact elicited tends to corroborate the conclusion. In\r\nsome parts of the glacial beds, there occur regular deposits of shells\r\nwhich must have lived and died in the places where we find them. From\r\nten to fifteen per cent, of them belong to species which are extinct,\r\nthat is to say, have not been detected living in any sea. Some of them\r\nare still inhabitants of the waters around our coasts, but the large\r\nmajority occur in the northern seas. They are emphatically northern\r\nshells, and get smaller in size and fewer in number as they proceed\r\nsouthward, till they disappear altogether. In like manner, the palm,\r\non the other hand, is characteristically a tropical plant. It attains\r\nits fullest development in intertropical countries, getting stunted\r\nin its progress towards either pole, and ceasing to grow in the open\r\nair beyond the thirty-eighth parallel of latitude in the southern\r\nhemisphere, and the forty-fifth in the northern. So, too, the ivy,\r\nwhich in our country hangs out its glossy festoons in every woodland,\r\nand around the crumbling walls of abbey, and castle, and tower, is\r\nnursed in the drawing-rooms of St. Petersburg as a delicate and\r\nfavourite exotic. In short, the laws which regulate the habitat of a\r\nplant or an animal are about as constant as those which determine its\r\nform. There are, indeed, exceptions to both. We may sometimes find a\r\nstray vulture from the shores of the Mediterranean gorging itself on\r\nsheep or lambs among the wolds of England,[8] just as we often see\r\n\r\n            \"A double cherry seeming parted,\r\n    But yet an union in partition;\"\r\n\r\nor as we hear of a sheep with five legs, and a kid with two heads.\r\nBut these exceptions, from their comparative rarity, only make the\r\nlaws more evident. When, therefore, we find, in various parts of our\r\ncountry, beds of shells in such a state of preservation as to lead\r\nus to believe that the animals must have lived and died where their\r\nremains are now to be seen, we justly infer that the districts where\r\nthey occur must at one period have been submerged. If the shells\r\nbelong to fresh-water species, it is plain that they occur on the site\r\nof an old lake. If they are marine, we conclude that the localities\r\nwhere they are found no matter how high above the sea must formerly\r\nhave stood greatly lower, so as to form the ocean bed. To proceed one\r\nstep further. If the shells are of a southern type, that is, if they\r\nbelong to species[9] which are known to exist only in wanner seas than\r\nour own, we pronounce that at a former period the latitudes of Great\r\nBritain must have enjoyed a more temperate and genial climate, so as\r\nto allow southern shells to have a wider range northwards. If, on the\r\nother hand, they are of an arctic or boreal type, we in the same way\r\ninfer that our latitudes were once marked by a severer temperature than\r\nthey now possess, so as to permit northern shells to range farther\r\nsouthwards. This reasoning is strictly correct, and the truth involved\r\nforms the basis of all inquiries into the former condition of the earth\r\nand its inhabitants.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 8: Two of these birds (_Neopron pecnopterus_) are stated to\r\nhave been seen near Kilve, in Somersetshire, in October 1825. One was\r\nshot, the other escaped.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 9: There is not a little difficulty in reasoning\r\nsatisfactorily as to climatal conditions, from the distribution of\r\nkindred forms. Even in a single genus there may be a wide range of\r\ngeographical distribution, so that mere generic identity is not always\r\na safe guide. Thus, the elephant now flourishes in tropical countries,\r\nbut in the glacial period a long-haired species was abundant in the\r\nfrozen north. I have above restricted myself entirely to _species_\r\nwhose habits and geographical distribution are already sufficiently\r\nknown.]\r\n\r\nThe evidence furnished by the northern shells in the boulder-clay\r\nseries is, accordingly, of the most unmistakable kind. These organisms\r\ntell us that at the time they lived our country lay sunk beneath a sea,\r\nsuch as that of Iceland and the North Cape, over which many an iceberg\r\nmust have journeyed, and thus they corroborate our conclusions, derived\r\nindependently from the deep clay and boulder beds and the striated\r\nrock-surfaces, as to the glacial origin of the boulder-clay.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\n\r\n  How the boulder came to be one \"Crag and tail\"--Scenery of\r\n       central Scotland: Edinburgh--\"Crag and tail\" formerly\r\n       associated in its origin with the boulder-clay--This\r\n       explanation erroneous--Denudation an old process--Its\r\n       results--Illustration from, the Mid-Lothian coal-field--The\r\n       three Ross-shire hills--The Hebrides relics of an\r\n       ancient land--Scenery of the western coast--Effects of\r\n       the breakers--Denudation of the Secondary strata of the\r\n       Hebrides--Preservative influence of trap-rocks--Lost\r\n       species of the Hebrides--Illustration--Origin of the\r\n       general denudation of the country--Illustrative action\r\n       of streams--Denudation a very slow process--Many old\r\n       land-surfaces may have been effaced--Varied aspect of the\r\n       British Islands during a period of submergence--Illustration.\r\n\r\nThe scratched and grooved surface of the boulder was produced when\r\nit was fast frozen in some iceberg, and driven gratingly across some\r\nsubmarine summit, or stranded on some rocky coast-line. But, from its\r\nrounded form, the stone had evidently undergone a long process of wear\r\nand tear previous to its glacial journey. Probably it had hitherto lain\r\nalong a surf-beaten beach, where in the course of ages it had gradually\r\nbeen worn into its present rounded shape. But how came it there? It\r\nmust originally have formed part of a flat sandstone bed, with many\r\nother beds piled above it. By what agency, then, was this great pile\r\nreduced to fragments?\r\n\r\nThe answer to these questions must be a somewhat lengthened one, for\r\nthe subject relates not to a few beds of rock hastily broken up and\r\ndispersed, but to the physical changes of an entire country, carried on\r\nduring a vast succession of geological periods.\r\n\r\nA phenomenon, known familiarly as \"crag and tail,\" has long been\r\nconnected in its origin with the drift or boulder beds. Has my reader\r\never travelled through central Scotland? If so, he must often have\r\nnoticed the abrupt isolated form of many of the hills, presenting a\r\nmural front to the west, and a long sloping declivity to the east.\r\nFrom the great number of isolated hard trap-rocks in this region, the\r\nphenomenon is much better seen than in most other parts of the kingdom.\r\nThere is, for instance, the castle rock of Stirling, with its beetling\r\ncrag and castellated summit, which present so imposing a front to the\r\nwest. Many other examples are seen along the line of the Edinburgh and\r\nGlasgow Railway. The range of hills south of Linlithgow, the singularly\r\nabrupt basalt of Binny Craig, the long rounded ridge of Ratho,\r\nthe double-peaked crag of Dalmahoy, the broad undulation of woody\r\nCorstorphine, are all examples more or less marked. Edinburgh itself\r\nis an excellent illustration. The Calton Hill shows a steep front to\r\nthe town, while its eastern side slopes away down to the sea. Arthur's\r\nSeat, in like manner, has a precipitous western face, and a gentle\r\ndeclivity eastward. The Castle rock, too, shoots up perpendicularly\r\nfrom the valley that girdles it on the north, west, and south, sinking\r\naway to the east in a long slope--\r\n\r\n    \"Whose ridgy back heaves to the sky,\r\n    Piled deep and massy, close and high.\"\r\n\r\nEast-Lothian presents several well-marked instances; in particular,\r\nNorth Berwick Law and Traprain. A phenomenon so general must have had\r\nsome general origin, and it was accordingly attributed to the same\r\nagency which produced the drift-clays and the striated rock-surfaces,\r\nwhen these were believed to be the results of great diluvial action.\r\nIt would seem, however, that the phenomenon of crag and tail should\r\nnot be associated with the boulder-clay. The latter is undoubtedly a\r\nnewer Tertiary formation,[10] but the denudation[11] which produced\r\ncrag and tail must have been going on long ere the Tertiary ages had\r\nbegun. There is satisfactory evidence that large areas of our country\r\nwere planed down at a greatly more ancient period than that of even the\r\noldest of the Tertiary series. Thus, the whole area of the county of\r\nSussex suffered a very extensive denudation during the later Secondary\r\nages. The Hebrides had undergone a similar process previous to the\r\ndeposition of the Lias and Oolite, and the Greywacke hills of south\r\nScotland, previous to the formation of the Old Red Sandstone. There\r\nseems thus to have been a general and continuous process of degradation\r\nat work during a long succession of geological ages.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 10: The reader is referred to the table of the geological\r\nformations at the end of the volume for the relative position of the\r\nbeds described.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 11: _Denudation_ is a geological term used to denote the\r\nremoval of rock by the wasting action of water, whereby the underlying\r\nmineral masses are _denuded_ or laid bare.]\r\n\r\nThe results of this long-continued action are of the most startling\r\nkind. I have referred to the phenomenon of crag and tail as perhaps the\r\nmost readily observable. We must not fail to remember that the crag\r\nwhich now stands up so prominently above the level of the surrounding\r\ncountry, at one period lay buried beneath an accumulation of sandstone,\r\nshale, or other strata, all of which have been carried away, so as\r\nto leave the harder rock in bold relief, with a portion of the less\r\ncoherent strata sloping as a long tail from its eastern side. The crag,\r\ntoo, is often breached in many places, worn down at one end, rounded\r\non the summit, and sometimes well-nigh ground away altogether, whilst\r\nin front there is invariably a deep hollow scooped out by the current\r\nwhen arrested by the abrupt cliff. In Fig. 2, _a_ represents a crag of\r\ngreenstone worn away and bared of the shales which once covered it;\r\n_b_, the sloping \"tail\" of softer strata, protected from abrasion by\r\nthe resistance of the trap-rock, and covered by a deep layer of drift,\r\n_d_; _c_ marks the hollow on the west side of the crag.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 2 \"Crag and tail.\"]\r\n\r\nBut when we come to measure the actual amount of material that has been\r\ncarried away, we are lost in conjecture as to the vastness of the time\r\nwhich such a process must have occupied. For instance, the coal-bearing\r\nstrata of Mid-Lothian must at one period have been connected with those\r\nof Linlithgow and Stirling. At a subsequent date, the western area\r\nsubsided to form the Stirlingshire coal-basin, and the eastern area, in\r\nlike manner, sank down to form the coal-basin of Mid-Lothian, while the\r\nintermediate portion stretched from east to west as a great arch, or,\r\nas it is termed geologically, an _anticlinal axis_. Now, the whole of\r\nthis arch has been worn away, not a vestige of it remains, and yet its\r\nupper or coal-bearing part was fully 3000 feet thick.[12]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 12: This remarkable example of denudation was first described\r\nby Mr. M'Laren, in his _Sketch of the Geology of Fife and the\r\nLothians_, a work in which the author showed himself to be in advance\r\nof the science of his time.]\r\n\r\nLet us take a small portion of this district, and endeavour to\r\ncalculate the amount of matter thus removed. The Pentland hills\r\nform a chain stretching from near Edinburgh for some fourteen miles\r\nsouthward, and having an average breadth of about two miles and a\r\nhalf. They are formed chiefly of felspathic trap-rocks, resting upon\r\nand interstratified with conglomerate apparently of Old Red age, which\r\nin turn lies upon vertical Silurian slates. Before the Carboniferous\r\nstrata were thrown down by successive _faults_, they must have covered\r\nthese hills completely to a depth of not less than 6000 feet.[13]\r\nFrom this small area, therefore, stratified sandstones, shales,\r\nlimestones, and coal, must have been removed to the enormous extent of\r\none billion, eight hundred and fifty-four thousand, four hundred and\r\nsixty-four millions of cubic feet.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 13: The actual depth of the Mid-Lothian coal-field, to the\r\nbase of the carboniferous limestone, is rather more than 3000 feet. It\r\nis, perhaps, rather under than over the truth to allow 3000 feet for\r\nthe total thickness of beds from the limestone to the conglomerate of\r\nLiberton, though, owing to the curved and contorted position of the\r\nstrata from Edinburgh to Stirlingshire, it is impossible to obtain a\r\nmeasurement of their real thickness. I have attributed the isolation\r\nof the Falkirk and Mid-Lothian coal-fields to the effect of faults\r\nand general depressions of their areas. This was assuredly the case\r\nin the latter coal-field, and probably in the former also. The trap\r\nwhich occurs between them, though in great abundance, has certainly\r\nnot acted as an elevating agent. It occurs in beds among the strata,\r\nand, judging from the number of associated tufas, appears to have been\r\nto a considerable extent erupted while the lower carboniferous series\r\nwas forming. Mr. M'Laren, in his excellent work, p. 100, states his\r\nopinion that the traps may have materially contributed to push up the\r\ncoal strata. A careful and extended examination of the district has\r\nconvinced me that this view is incorrect.]\r\n\r\nBut, perhaps, the most striking instances of denudation in the British\r\nIslands are the three famous Ross-shire hills--Suil Veinn, Coul Mor,\r\nand Coul Bheig. They are formed of piles of sandstone beds like tiers\r\nof regular masonry, and reach a height of 3000 feet over the sea. The\r\nsandstone of which they are composed must once have formed a bed or\r\nset of beds fully 2000 feet thick, that covered the whole district for\r\nmany miles around. Yet of this extensive deposit there now exist only\r\na few isolated fragments. I have watched the sunshine and shadow of an\r\nautumn sky resting alternately on these strange pyramidal hills, as\r\nthey towered in their giant proportions like the last remnants of a\r\nmighty rampart that had stood the brunt of a long siege, and, breached\r\nat last in many places, had been all but levelled to the ground. How\r\nlong-continued and how potent must that agency have been which could\r\ncut down and disperse the massive barrier that flanked the western\r\ncoast of Ross-shire to a height of 2000 feet!\r\n\r\nThe Hebrides are but the shattered relics of an old land that had its\r\nmountain-peaks and its glens, its streams and lakes, and may have\r\nnursed in its solitude the red-deer and the eagle, but was never\r\ntrodden by the foot of man. A glance at the map is enough to convince\r\nus of this. We there see islands, and peninsulas, and promontories,\r\nand deep bays, and long-retiring inlets, as though the country had\r\nbeen submerged and only its higher points remained above water. The\r\nconviction is impressed more strongly upon us by a visit to these\r\nshores. We sail through the windings of one of the \"sounds,\" and can\r\nscarcely believe that we are on the bosom of the salt sea. Hills rise\r\non all sides, and the water, smooth as a polished mirror, shows so\r\npure and limpid that in the sunshine we can see the white pebbles that\r\nstrew its bed many fathoms down. The eastern shore is often abruptly\r\ninterrupted by long-receding lochs edged round with lofty mountains,\r\nand thus, where we had looked to see a deep heathy glen, with,\r\nperchance, a white tree-shaded mansion in the far distance, and a few\r\ndun smoking cottages in front, we are surprised to catch a glimpse of\r\nthe white sails of a yacht, or the darker canvas of the herring-boats.\r\nWe sail on, and soon a sudden turn brings us abruptly to the mouth of\r\nthe sound. A bold headland, studded around with rocky islets, rises\r\nperpendicularly from the sea, bleak and bare, without a bush or tree,\r\nor the faintest trace of the proximity of man. The broad swell of the\r\nAtlantic comes rolling in among these rocks, and breaks in foam against\r\nthe grey cliffs overhead. In tempests, such a scene must be of the most\r\nterrific kind. Wo to the hapless vessel that is sucked into the vortex\r\nof these breakers, whose roar is sometimes heard at the distance of\r\nmiles! Even in the calmest weather the white surf comes surging in,\r\nand a low sullen boom is ever reverberating along the shore. We see\r\nthe harder rocks protruding far into the sea, and often pierced with\r\nlong twilight caves, while the softer ones are worn into deep clefts,\r\nor hollowed out into open bays strewed over with shingle. The sunken\r\nrocks and islets, scarcely showing their tops above water, were all\r\nevidently at one time connected, for, as we recede from the shore, we\r\ncan mark how the process of demolition goes on. There is first the\r\nprojecting ness or promontory, well-nigh severed from the mainland, but\r\nstill connected by a rude arch, through which the swell ever gurgles\r\nto and fro. Then, a little farther from the shore, a huge isolated\r\ncrag, washed on all sides by the surge, raises its grey lichen-clothed\r\nsummit. A short way beyond, there is the well-worn islet whose surface\r\nshelters neither lichen nor sea-weed, but is ever wet with the dash of\r\nthe waves. Further to the sea, the white gleam of the breakers marks\r\nthe site of the sunken rock. Thus, in the space of a hundred yards, we\r\nmay sometimes behold the progress of change from land to sea, and see\r\nbefore us a specimen of that action which slowly but yet steadily has\r\nnarrowed and breached the outline of our western shores.[14]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 14: I have endeavoured to illustrate the process of\r\ndenudation by a reference to breaker-action on the existing coast-line\r\nof the Hebrides; but a strong current must have materially increased\r\nthe force of the ancient waves, and produced abrasion to some depth\r\nbelow them.]\r\n\r\nIf we attempt to trace the connexions of strata among the Hebrides,\r\nwe shall be more fully impressed with the magnitude of the changes\r\nwhich have been effected. Thus the Lias and Oolite occur in patches\r\nalong the shores of Mull, Morven, Ardnamurchan, Eigg, Skye, Raasay,\r\nand Applecross. But though now only in patches, these formations must\r\nonce have extended over a considerable area, for they seem to form the\r\nunder-rock of the whole of the northern part of Skye, and are seen in\r\nalmost every lone island from Ardnamurchan Point to the Shiant Isles.\r\nThese scattered portions, often many miles distant from each other,\r\nare the remnants of a great sheet of liassic and oolitic strata, now\r\nalmost entirely swept away, and are extant from having been covered\r\nover with hard trap-rocks. But for these it may be doubted whether we\r\nshould ever have known that corals once gleamed white along the shores\r\nof Skye, that the many-chambered ammonite swam over the site of the\r\nCoolin Hills, that the huge reptilian monsters of these ancient times,\r\nicthyosaurs and plesiosaurs, careered through the waters that laved\r\nthe grey hills of Sleat, and that forests of zamia and cycas, and many\r\nother plants indicative of a warm climate, bloomed green and luxuriant\r\nalong the site of that strange mist-clad cliff-line, that shoots up\r\ninto the pinnacles of the Storr and Quiraing. It is curious to reflect,\r\nthat the records of these peaceful scenes have been preserved to us by\r\nthe devastating eruptions of volcanic forces; that the old lava-streams\r\nwhich spread death through the waters along whose bed they travelled,\r\nhave yet been the means of protecting the districts which they wasted,\r\nwhile those parts where they did not reach have been long since swept\r\naway. It is allowable to believe, that in the portions of liassic\r\nstrata which have been destroyed there existed the remains of not a\r\nfew species, perhaps some genera, to be found nowhere else, and of\r\nwhose former existence there is now, by consequence, no trace. In the\r\nsmall island of Pabba--a relic of the Scottish Lias--I found thirty-one\r\nspecies, of which Dr. Wright has pronounced four to be new.[15] A\r\nsubsequent visit to the adjacent island of Raasay has increased the\r\nlist. In short, every patch of these Secondary rocks, if thoroughly\r\nexplored, might be found to yield its peculiar organisms. And in the\r\nfar larger area that has been carried away there existed, doubtless,\r\nmany more. We are accustomed to see individuals perish and their\r\nremains crumble away, but the species still holds on. In the stratified\r\nportion of the earth's crust, however, we mark how not merely\r\nindividuals have perished, but whole genera and species; but of these\r\nthe remains are still before us in the rocks; we can study their forms,\r\nand, from a comparison with recent species and genera, can arrive at\r\nsome idea of their nature and functions. In this way, we are able to\r\npicture the various conditions of the earth when these organisms lived\r\nin succession upon its surface. Yet, we may readily conjecture, that\r\nin ancient eras many tribes and genera of plants and animals lived\r\nfor ages, and then passed away without leaving any record of their\r\nexistence. Many circumstances might concur to prevent the preservation\r\nof their remains. The species of the Hebrides were preserved in the\r\nusual manner, but the cemetery in which their remains were entombed has\r\nbeen washed away, and they can be seen nowhere else. It is as if on\r\nsome isolated country there had lived a race of men, tall Patagonians,\r\nor swarthy Hottentots, or diminutive Laplanders, with a civilisation of\r\ntheir own; owing to some change of climate the race gradually dwindled\r\ndown until it died out; eventually, too, the land settled down beneath\r\nthe sea with all its ruined cities and villages, which, as they reached\r\nin succession the level of the waves, were torn up and dispersed, and\r\nother races at last voyaged over the site of that old land, dreaming\r\nnot, that in bygone years fellow-mortals of an extinct type had\r\npastured their herds where now there rolled a widespread sea.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 15: _Quart. Jour. Geol. Soc._, vol. xiv. p. 26.]\r\n\r\nBut to return. We have seen that the long-continued action of the sea\r\nhas been sufficient to breach and waste away the existing coast-line\r\nof western Scotland. When, therefore, such results are produced by so\r\nordinary a cause, need we go to seek the agency of great debacles to\r\nexplain the denudation of other parts of the country? It is known that\r\nat great depths currents have little effect upon the rocks which they\r\ntraverse, and that their action is greater as it nears the surface. To\r\naccount for the phenomena of crag and tail, and the general denudation\r\nof the country, we may suppose the land to have been often submerged\r\nand re-elevated. As hill after hill rose towards or sank below the\r\nsea-level, it would be assailed by a strong current that flowed\r\nfrom the west and north-west, until, in its slow upward or downward\r\nprogress, it got beyond the reach of the denuding agencies. In this way\r\nthe general contour of the land would be greatly though very gradually\r\nchanged. Hills of sandstone, or other material of feeble resistance,\r\nwould be swept away, the harder trap-rocks would stand up bared of the\r\nstrata which once covered them, deep hollows would be excavated in\r\nfront of all the more prominent eminences, and long declivities would\r\nbe left behind them.--(See Fig. 2.)\r\n\r\nIf my reader has ever visited the channel of a mountain-torrent--\r\n\r\n                \"Imbres\r\n    Quern super notas aluere ripas\"--\r\n\r\nhe must have noticed an exact counterpart to these appearances. When\r\nthe waters have subsided, the overflowed parts are seen to be covered\r\nin many places with sand. Wherever a pebble occurs along the surface\r\nof this sand, it has invariably a hollow before it on the side facing\r\nthe direction whence the stream is flowing, and a long tail of sand\r\npointing down the channel. If we watch the motion of the water along\r\nits bed, the denuding agency may be seen actively at work. Every pebble\r\nthat protrudes above the shallow streamlet arrests the course of the\r\ncurrent, which is then diverted in three directions. One part turns\r\noff to the right hand of the pebble, and cuts away the sand from its\r\nflank; another part strikes off to the left, and removes the sand from\r\nthat side; while a middle part descends in front of the pebble, and,\r\nby a kind of circular or gyratory movement, scoops out a hollow in the\r\nsand in front. Behind the pebble the water is pretty still, so that the\r\nsand remains undisturbed, and is further increased by the accumulation\r\nabove it of sediment swept round by the lateral currents. Now, in place\r\nof the supposed stream, let us substitute the ocean with its westerly\r\ncurrent--for the pebble, a great trap-hill--for the sand, easily\r\nfriable shales and sandstones, and we have exactly the condition of\r\nthings which produced crag and tail.\r\n\r\nThis process of destruction must have been in progress during many\r\ngeological ages. We may suppose, that in that time the land often\r\nchanged level, sometimes rising far above the sea, and sometimes\r\nsinking deep below it. We can well believe that the surface would\r\noften be covered with vegetation; that plants, widely differing from\r\nthose which are now indigenous, clothed its hill-sides and shaded\r\nits valleys; and that animals of long extinct forms roamed over its\r\nplains or prowled amid its forests. When the country, in the lapse of\r\ncenturies, sank beneath the sea-level, all trace of these scenes would\r\neventually be effaced. The westerly currents would soon recommence the\r\nprocess of degradation, uprooting the forests, devastating the plains,\r\nwearing down the hills, and scooping out the valleys; and so, when the\r\nocean-bed, in the course of ages, became again dry land, it would arise\r\n\"another and yet the same.\" The little valley, where once, perchance,\r\nthe mastodon used to rest his massive bulk amid a rich growth of ferns,\r\nshaded by the thick umbrage of coniferous trees, would emerge a deep\r\nglen with bare and barren rocks on either side; the site of the hill\r\nwhereon herds of the gazelle-like anoplothere were wont to browse,\r\nmight reappear a level plain; the low-browed rock, under whose shadow\r\nthe ungraceful palæothere used of old to rest from the heat of the\r\nnoon-tide sun, might emerge a beetling crag shooting up several hundred\r\nfeet over the valley. It is by this repeated elevation and submergence,\r\ncarried on for many ages, that our country has acquired its present\r\nconfiguration.\r\n\r\nWe can easily picture to ourselves the appearance which the British\r\nIslands would thus at different periods present. At one time, nearly\r\nthe whole of England would be under water, with, however, a few islands\r\nrepresenting the higher peaks of Cornwall; others scattered over the\r\nsite of the West Riding of Yorkshire; and a hilly tract of land over\r\nwhat is now Wales. Scotland must have existed in a sorely mutilated\r\nstate. A thick-set archipelago would represent the Cheviot Hills, and\r\nthe country south of the Forth and the Clyde; north of which there\r\nwould intervene a broad strait, with a comparatively large area of\r\nundulating land beyond, stretching across what is now the area of\r\nthe Grampian Hills. A narrow fiord would run along the site of the\r\nCaledonian Canal, cutting the country into two parts, and running\r\nfar into it on either side as deep lochs and bays. I have had such a\r\ncondition of things vividly recalled when on the summit of a lofty hill\r\nin early morning, while the mists were still floating over the lower\r\ngrounds, and only the higher hill-tops, like so many islands, rose\r\nabove the sea of cloud. It was not a little interesting to cast the eye\r\nathwart this changing scene, and mark how each well-known peak and\r\neminence looked when deprived of its broad sweep of base. What before\r\nhad always seemed an abrupt precipitous summit, now took the form of a\r\nlonely rock or deep-sea stack, that might have served as a haunt for\r\nthe gull and the gannet. The long swelling hill rose above the mist as\r\na low undulating island, treeless and barren. It was easy to think of\r\nthat wide expanse of mist as the veritable domain of ocean, to picture\r\nthe time when these were veritable islands lashed by the surge, and\r\nto conjure up visions of ice-floes drifting through the narrows, or\r\nstranding on the rocks, amid a scene of wide-spread nakedness and\r\ndesolation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Interior of the boulder Wide intervals of\r\n       Geology--Illustration--Long interval between the\r\n       formation of the boulder as part of a sand-bed,\r\n       and its striation by glacial action--Sketch of the\r\n       intervening ages--The boulder a Lower Carboniferous\r\n       rock--Cycles of the astronomer and the geologist\r\n       contrasted--Illustration--Plants shown by the boulder once\r\n       grew green on land--Traces of that ancient land--Its seas,\r\n       shores, forests, and lakes, all productive of material\r\n       aids to our comfort and power--Plants of the Carboniferous\r\n       era--Ferns--Tree-ferns--Calamites--Asterophyllites--\r\n       Lepidodendron--Lepidostrobus--Stigmaria--Scene in a ruined\r\n       palace--Sigillaria--Coniferæ, Cycadeæ--Antholites, the oldest\r\n       known flower--Grade of the Carboniferous flora--Its resemblance\r\n       to that of New Zealand.\r\n\r\nI have likened the boulder to an old volume of the middle ages encased\r\nin a modern binding. We have looked a little into the mechanism and\r\nhistory of the boards; in other words, we have gone over the history of\r\nthe scratched surface of the boulder, of the clays and sands around it,\r\nand of that still earlier cycle of denudation whereof the rock itself\r\nis probably a relic. Before proceeding to open the volume itself, it\r\nwill be well that we clearly mark the wide interval in time between\r\nthe ages represented by the surface-striation and those indicated by\r\nthe interior of the boulder. When we proceed from the groovings on the\r\noutside to the plants within, we pass, to be sure, over scarcely an\r\ninch of space, but we make a leap over untold millenniums in point of\r\ntime. It is as if we had laid our hands on a volume of history which\r\nhad by some misfortune found its way into the nursery. The first page\r\nthat catches our eye relates the battle of the Reform Bill, and, on\r\nturning the previous leaf, we find ourselves with Boadicea and her\r\nwoad-coloured soldiery. Now, if one utterly ignorant of the chronology\r\nof the country were to be told that the volume related solely to one\r\npeople, he would at once see from the manners and customs delineated,\r\nthat the two pages referred to very different states of civilisation,\r\nand consequently to widely-separated periods. But he could give no\r\naccount of how long an interval might have elapsed between the time\r\nwhen London had its inhabitants massacred by Boadicea, and the time\r\nwhen another generation of them was excited by the tardiness of King\r\nWilliam iv. He could form no conjecture as to what events might have\r\nhappened in the meanwhile. The interval might be a century or twenty\r\ncenturies, wherein the city might have been burnt down fifty times.\r\nClearly, if he wished to make himself acquainted with the intervening\r\nhistory, he would have to betake himself to an unmutilated volume.\r\n\r\nAnd just so is it with our boulder. We can easily believe, merely from\r\nlooking at it as it lies on its clayey bed, that a long time must have\r\nelapsed between the time of its formation as part of a sandstone bed,\r\nand the period of its transportation and striation by an iceberg. The\r\nsand of which it is formed must have been washed down by currents, and\r\nother sediment would settle down over it. It would take some time to\r\nacquire its present hardness and solidity, while, in long subsequent\r\ntimes, after being broken up and well-rounded by breaker or current\r\naction, it may have lain on some old coast-line for centuries before it\r\nwas finally frozen into an ice-floe, and so freighted to a distance.\r\nBut the stone, with all its stories of the olden time, can tell us\r\nnothing of this intervening period. It leads us from a dreary frozen\r\nsea at once into a land of tropical luxuriance, and so, if we desire to\r\nknow anything of the missing portion of the chronology, we must seek it\r\nelsewhere.\r\n\r\nThe Boulder-clay is one of the latest of geologic periods.[16] Beyond\r\nit we get into Tertiary times, and learn from the caves of Yorkshire\r\nhow elephants, hyenas, rhinoceroses, hippopotami, bears, and wolves,\r\nprowled over the rich valleys; while, from the quarries of the Isle of\r\nWight, we see how at an earlier time herds of uncouth palæotheres and\r\nslimly-built anoplotheres browsed the plains of Old England. Beyond\r\nthe Tertiary ages come those of the Chalk, with its ocean that swarmed\r\nwith sea-urchins, terebratulæ, pectens, sponges, and many other forms.\r\nThen arises the era of the Wealden, with its bosky land haunted by the\r\nunwieldy iguanodon; the Oolite, with its land rich in a coniferous\r\nflora, and tenanted by a race of small marsupial animals, and its seas\r\nabounding in corals, encrinites of many a form, cidares, cuttle-fishes,\r\nand ammonites. Further back still, come the times of the Lias, that\r\nstrange era in the history of our country, when reptiles huger than\r\nthose of the Nile swam the seas, and sped on wings through the air.\r\nThen come the times of the Trias, when a vegetation still further\r\nremoved from existing types clothed the land, and frogs large as oxen\r\nwaddled along the shores. Then the times of the Permian, with its deep\r\nsea tenanted by a meagre list of corals and shells, and by a type of\r\nfishes that was slowly passing away. We arrive at last at the Coal or\r\nCarboniferous period, to the older ages of which our boulder belongs.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 16: For the names and succession of the rocks of which the\r\nknown part of the earth's crust is composed, see the Table at the end\r\nof the volume.]\r\n\r\nThese eras may have been some longer, some shorter, but each had a\r\nduration which, when tried by human standards, must be regarded as\r\nimmensely protracted. The cycles of astronomy are very vast, yet\r\nI have often thought that the cycles of geology, though probably\r\nof much less duration, impress us more forcibly with the antiquity\r\nof our planet. The astronomer tells us of light that has taken two\r\nmillions of years to reach our earth, and of nebulæ that are millions\r\nupon millions of miles distant, but these numbers are so vast that\r\nwe cannot bring ourselves to realize them. We _know_ that there is a\r\ngreat difference between two millions and ten millions, but we cannot\r\nfully _appreciate_ it, and so the periods of the astronomer, beyond a\r\ncertain point, cease adequately to impress us. So long as they can be\r\neasily contrasted with our own standards of comparison, they have their\r\nfull force; but after that, every additional million, or ten millions,\r\nor ten hundred millions, produces only a confused and bewildered sense\r\nof immensity, and the comparative amount of each addition fails to be\r\nrealized. Will my reader forgive a homely illustration:--Some years\r\nago, I stood at the pier-head of one of our smaller sea-port towns, and\r\nwatched the sun as it sullenly sank behind the outline of the opposite\r\nhills. The breadth of the channel, in the direction of sunset, was\r\nseveral miles, but in the flush of evening one fancied he could almost\r\nhave thrown a stone across. The water lay unruffled by a ripple, and\r\nreflected all the thousand varying tints that lighted up the sky. The\r\nharbour, that had been a busy scene all evening, began to grow less\r\nnoisy, as one by one the herring-boats pushed out to sea. I found it\r\nnot a little interesting to mark, as the boats gained the open firth,\r\nhow the opposite coast-line gradually seemed to recede. The farther the\r\ndark sails withdrew, the more remote did the adjacent shores appear,\r\nuntil, as the last tinge of glory faded from the clouds, and a cold\r\ngrey tint settled down over the landscape, the hills lay deep in shade\r\nand stretched away in the twilight as a dark and distant land from\r\nwhose valleys there rose troops of stars. The coast-line, as seen in\r\nearly evening, reminded me of the periods of the astronomer; as seen in\r\nearly night, it reminded me of the periods of the geologist. We fail to\r\nappreciate the real duration of astronomical cycles, because they are\r\npresented to us each as one vast period. They are not subdivided into\r\nintervals, and contain no succession of events, by means of which, as\r\nby milestones, we might estimate their extent; and so their unvaried\r\ncontinuity tends to diminish the impression of their vastness, just\r\nas the firth, without any islet or vessel on its surface, seemed\r\ngreatly narrower than it really was. For it is with time as it is with\r\nspace--the eye cannot abstractly estimate distance, nor can the mind\r\nestimate duration. In either case, the process must be conducted by a\r\ncomparison with known standards. The geological periods exemplify the\r\nsame rule. They may not be greater, perhaps not so great, as those\r\nrevealed by astronomy, yet their vastness impresses us more, because we\r\ncan trace out their history, and see how step by step they progressed.\r\nThus, that the interval between the boulder-clay and the coal-measurer\r\nwas immense, we learn from the records of many successive ages that\r\nintervened, in the same way that one began to perceive the real breadth\r\nof the firth, by resting his eye on the succession of intervening\r\nherring-boats. In the former case, the mind has ever and anon a sure\r\nfooting on which to pause in gauging bygone eternity; in the latter,\r\nthe eye had likewise a succession of points on which to rest in\r\nmeasuring distance. Or, to return to a former illustration: Boadicea\r\nlived eighteen hundred years ago, but who does not feel that the last\r\nnine hundred years look a great deal longer than the first? The one\r\nset has few marked incidents to fix the thoughts; the other is replete\r\nwith those of the most momentous kind. In the one, we have M meagre\r\nlist of conquerors and kings, from Julius Cæsar down to Athelstan; in\r\nthe other, events crowd upon us from the waning of the Saxon power down\r\nthrough the rising glory of our country to the present plenitude of\r\nits power and greatness. The early centuries, like the cycles of the\r\nastronomer, pass through our mind rather as one continuous period; the\r\nlater centuries, like the cycles of the geologist, arrest our thoughts\r\nby a succession of minor periods, and hence the idea of duration is\r\nmore vividly suggested by the diversified events of the one series,\r\nthan by the comparatively unbroken continuity of the other.\r\n\r\nLet us now open the volume and try to decipher the strange legends\r\nwhich it contains. On removing some of the upper layers of the boulder,\r\nI found, as I have said, well-preserved remains of several kinds of\r\nplants. One of them was ribbed longitudinally, with transverse notches\r\nevery three or four inches, us though a number of slender threads\r\nhad been stretched along a rod, and tied tightly to it at regular\r\nintervals. Another, sorely mutilated, was pitted all over somewhat\r\nafter the fashion in which the confectioner punctures his biscuits. A\r\nthird had a more regular pattern, being prettily fretted with small\r\nlozenge-shaped prominences that wound spirally round the stalk. Other\r\nplants seemed to be present, but in a very bad state of preservation.\r\nThey were all jumbled together and converted into a black coaly\r\nsubstance, in which no structure could be discerned.\r\n\r\nThese plants assuredly once grew green upon the land; but where now is\r\nthat land on which they flourished? Had it hills and valleys, rivers\r\nand lakes, such as diversify our country? Was it tenanted by sentient\r\nbeings, and, if so, what were their forms? Did insects hum their way\r\nthrough the air, and cattle browse on the plains, and fish gambol in\r\nthe rivers? Was the land shaded with forests, dark and rugged like\r\nthose of Norway, or fragrant as the orange-groves of Spain? What, in\r\nfine, were its peculiar features, and how far did its scenery resemble\r\nthat of any country of the present day?\r\n\r\nThat old land has not entirely disappeared. Traces of it are found\r\npretty extensively in South Wales, in Staffordshire, around Newcastle,\r\nand through central Scotland. Strange as it may seem, its forests\r\nare still standing in many places. The fishes that disported in its\r\nlakes, the insects that fluttered amid its woods, and the lizards that\r\ncrawled among its herbage, are still in part preserved to us. Nay,\r\nmore; we may sometimes see the sea-beaches of that ancient land pitted\r\nwith rain-drops, and roughened with ripple-marks, as freshly as if the\r\nshower had fallen and the tide had flowed only yesterday. The peasants\r\nalong the Bay of Naples gathered grapes from the flanks of Vesuvius\r\nfor well-nigh seventeen centuries, before it was ascertained that they\r\ndaily walked over the site of buried cities, with temples, theatres,\r\nand private houses still erect. It was many more centuries ere the\r\npeople of Great Britain discovered that not a few of their villages and\r\ntowns stood on the site of buried forests, and lakes, and seas. We have\r\nnow, however, become aware of the fact, and are making good use of it.\r\nWe dig into the earth and exhume these old forests to supply us with\r\nlight and fuel; we quarry into the ripple-marked shores which fringed\r\nthat old land, and build our houses with the hardened sand; we calcine\r\nthe ferruginous mud that gathered in its swampy hollows, and extract\r\ntherefrom our most faithful ally both in peace and war--metallic iron;\r\nwe burn the delicate corals and shells and lily-like zoophytes which\r\nlived in the sea of that far-distant era, to enable us to smelt our\r\niron, to build our houses, and manure our fields; in short, every year\r\nwe are discovering some new and valuable material in the productions\r\nof that period, or finding out some new use which can be made of the\r\nsubstances already known. A more than ordinary interest, therefore,\r\nattaches to the history of the land and sea which have furnished us\r\nwith so many aids to comfort as well as power; and we shall find, as we\r\ngo on, that that history is a very curious one.\r\n\r\nI shall describe some of the more common plants and animals of the\r\nperiod, that we may be able, in some measure, to look back through the\r\nages of the past, and see how these plants would appear when they cast\r\ntheir broad shadow over river and lake, and how these animals would\r\nhave seemed to human eye in the twilight of the forest, in the sluggish\r\nflow of the river, and in the stagnant waters of the lagoon.\r\n\r\nThe _Flora_, or vegetation of the Carboniferous era, differed\r\nwidely from any that now exists. With the exception of the highest\r\nor exogenous class, it possessed representatives of all the existing\r\nclasses of the botanic scale, but in very strange proportions. The\r\nnumber of species of carboniferous plants already found in Great\r\nBritain amounts to about three hundred, amongst which the ferns are\r\nespecially abundant. Some of them seem to have been low-growing\r\nplants, like the bracken of our hillsides, but others must have shot\r\nup to the height of forest trees. We can recognise a few coniferous\r\nand cycadaceous plants, a good many stems resembling the \"horse-tail\"\r\nof our marshy grounds, and some of large size akin to the creeping\r\nclub-moss of our heaths; but there are still many to which there exist\r\nno living analogues.\r\n\r\nWhen we examine the roof of a coal-pit, or split open plates of shale\r\nin a quarry of the coal-measures, we are struck with the similarity\r\nwhich the ferns in the stone bear to those among our woods and hills.\r\nOne of the most common, and, at the same time, most elegant forms,\r\nis the _Sphenopteris_ or wedge-leaved fern, of which a large list\r\nof species is known. One of them (_S. crenata_) had a strong stem,\r\nfrom which there sprung straight tapering branches richly dight with\r\nleaflets. The leaflets--somewhat like minute oak-leaves--were ranged\r\nlike those of our modern ferns, along two sides of the stalk, in\r\nalternate order, and tapered gently away to its outer extremity. The\r\neffect of the whole is singularly rich, and one can well believe that a\r\ngarland of this ancient fern would have wreathed as gracefully around a\r\nvictor's brow as the parsley of Nemea or the laurel-leaves of Delphi.\r\n\r\nAnother plant of the same genus (_S. affinis_, Fig. 3) has leaflets\r\nlike the petals of the meadow-daisy, arranged in clusters along its\r\nslim diverging stalks. From a collection and comparison of many\r\nspecimens, the late lamented Hugh Miller was enabled to make a drawing\r\nof this fern as it must have appeared when it waved green along the\r\nold carboniferous hill-sides. I enjoyed the privilege of going over\r\nthese specimens with him, and marked how, under a master-hand, piece\r\nby piece fell into its proper place, and yielded up its evidence. His\r\nrestoration, which forms the frontispiece to his last work, is a very\r\nbeautiful one, and it is as true as it is beautiful.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 3. Sphenopteris affinis.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 4. Pecopteris.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 5. Cyclopteris.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 6. Neuropteris.]\r\n\r\nThe _Pecopteris_ (Fig. 4, _P. heterophylla_) or comb-fern, is so called\r\nfrom its stiff thick leaflets being in some species arranged along the\r\nstalk like the teeth along the centre of a comb. Of all the plants\r\nof the coal-measures this is the one that approaches most closely to\r\nliving nature. It appears to be almost identical with the _pteris_,\r\nof which one species is well known as the bracken of our hill-sides.\r\nDr. Hooker figures together a frond of a New Zealand species (_P.\r\nesculenta_) and a fossil frond from the Newcastle pits. They are\r\nso similar as to be easily mistaken at first sight for drawings of\r\nthe same plant.[17] The _Neuropteris_ (as _N. gigantea_, Fig. 6) or\r\nnerve-leaved fern, is remarkable for its strongly-defined venation. It\r\nis scarcely, perhaps, so elegant in its outline as the _sphenopteris_,\r\nor some of the other ferns. Its leaflets are large and thick, with an\r\noblong or rounded form, and arranged either singly along the frond\r\nstem, or along secondary foot-stalks, which diverge from the main stem.\r\nOf the latter kind, some of the species have a good deal of resemblance\r\nto our _Osmunda regalis_ or royal fern. A species of the former class\r\n(_N. cordata_) might readily enough be mistaken for the young leaves\r\nof the _Scolopendrium_ or hart's-tongue, which hangs out its glossy\r\ngreen amid the gloom of dank and dripping rocks. There are, besides,\r\nseveral other genera of ferns in the Carboniferous strata, such as the\r\n_Cyclopteris_ (_C. dilatata_, Fig. 5) or round-leaved fern, and the\r\n_Odontopteris_ or tooth-fern. Most of these seem to have been lowly\r\nplants, like the ferns of our own country. But there was another class\r\nto which no analogue can be shown in Europe. They rose high over their\r\nhumbler congeners as lofty trees, and must be studied by a reference to\r\nthe existing tree-ferns of intertropical countries.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 17: Hooker, _Mem. Geol. Surv._ vol. ii. part ii. p. 400.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 7. Living Tree-fern.]\r\n\r\nTree-ferns flourish in warm climates, and are met with in Brazil, the\r\nEast and West Indies, New Zealand, &c. They rise sometimes to the\r\nheight of fifty or sixty feet, with a long tapering stem surmounted\r\nby a dense crown of graceful fronds, and might easily be mistaken at\r\na little distance for palms. All the known species belong to the same\r\ndivision (_Polypodiaceæ_) with the common polypodium of our road-sides.\r\nIn some genera, as the _alsophila_ of the East Indies, the trunk is\r\nribbed by long creeping branches, or rather rootlets, which descend to\r\nthe soil, giving the tree somewhat of the appearance so often seen in\r\nold woods, where venerable fir-trees have been firmly encased by the\r\nbearded stems of the ivy. Another genus, the _Cyathea_, has its stem\r\ncovered with oblong scars where leaves were attached, and a circle of\r\nrich outspread fronds surmounts its summit. One of the coal-measure\r\ntree-ferns seems to have resembled this recent type. It is named\r\nthe _Caulopteris_ or stalk-fern, and had a thick stem picturesquely\r\nroughened by irregular oblong leaf-scars, that wound spirally from its\r\nbase to its point. No specimen has hitherto been found showing the\r\nfronds in connexion with the stem, so that we are still ignorant of\r\nthe kind of foliage exhibited by this ancient tree. There can be no\r\ndoubt, however, that it was crowned with a large tuft of boughs that\r\ncast their shadow over the sward below, and we may, perhaps, believe\r\nthat some of the numerous detached ferns found in the shales of the\r\ncoal-series, once formed part of this lofty coronal.\r\n\r\nAn important section of the carboniferous plants is embraced under\r\nthe generic name of _Calamites_. They had smooth jointed stems, like\r\nreeds, and terminated beneath in an obtuse curved point (Fig. 8),\r\nfrom which there sprang broad leaflets or rather rootlets. After many\r\nyears of research our knowledge of these plants is still very scanty.\r\nSome of them have exhibited a highly-organized internal structure,\r\nfrom which it appears that they consisted--first, of a soft central\r\ncellular pith; second, of a thick layer of woody tissue; and third, an\r\nexternal cylinder of strong bark, ribbed longitudinally, and furrowed\r\ntransversely. They have been ranked with the common horse-tail of our\r\nponds, but they would rather appear to belong to a higher family. The\r\nbreadth of the stem is very various, some specimens being a foot or\r\nmore in diameter, others scarcely half an inch. From the discoveries of\r\nProfessor Williamson and Mr. Binny of Manchester, it seems not unlikely\r\nthat what we call calamites may be really the inner core of a plant not\r\nyet named, just as a set of fossils were long called _sternbergiæ_,\r\nbefore they were discovered to be really the pith of coniferous trees.\r\nWith regard to the branches of the calamites, Brongniart's conjecture\r\nmay be true, that they exist among the group of plants called\r\n_asterophyllites_. It is not unlikely that many dissimilar plants have\r\nbeen grouped together as calamites, and, on the other hand, that plants\r\nallied to the typical species have been thrown into separate genera.\r\nFor it requires but a slight acquaintance with the vegetable kingdom to\r\nknow how many forms analogous parts of the same plant may assume, and\r\nhow impossible it would often be to guess the real relationship of such\r\nvarieties if they were not found growing together on one plant.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 8. Terminal portion of a calamite stem.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 9.[18]]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 18: The fossil given in Fig. 9 is named by Lindley (_Foss.\r\nFlo._ t. 15, 16), _Calamites nodosus_. He admits, however, that it was\r\nnot found in actual contact with a calamite stem. It has exactly the\r\ncontour of an asterophyllite, and might, perhaps, be referred to that\r\ngenus. It is inserted here that the reader may see the general form of\r\nthe asterophyllites, and the close relationship that subsists between\r\nthese plants and the calamites.]\r\n\r\nA remarkably graceful class of the coal-plants are known as\r\n_asterophyllites_. They had slim fluted and jointed stalks, apparently\r\nof humble growth. From each of the joints there sprang two thin\r\nopposite branches with stellate clusters of leaflets arranged round\r\nthem at equal distances. If the reader will take a young rush-stalk,\r\nand string along it a number of the flowers of the little star-wort,\r\nkeeping them a little distance apart, he may form some idea of the\r\nappearance of a single branch of the star-bearing _asterophyllite_.\r\nSome of the plants embraced under this genus are conjectured to have\r\nbeen aquatic, spreading out their clusters of leaflets in the green\r\nsluggish water of stagnant pools; but many of them are evidently\r\nrelated to the calamites, and may possibly have formed part of these\r\nplants.\r\n\r\nWhoever has rambled much in a coal-country, scrambling through briars\r\nand brambles in old quarries, or threading his way among the rocks\r\nof river-courses, must often have noticed, on the exposed surface of\r\nsandstone blocks, dark ribbon-like bands fretted over with little\r\ndiamond-shaped knobs. They are so common in some districts, that you\r\ncan scarcely light upon a piece of sandstone which does not show one\r\nor more. They belong to a carboniferous plant known as _lepidodendron_\r\n(Fig. 10) or scaly tree, from the peculiar style of ornamentation which\r\nadorned its bark. Its structure and affinities have puzzled botanists\r\nnot a little. A well-preserved specimen reminds one of the appearance\r\npresented by a twig of the Scotch fir, when stripped of its green\r\nspiky leaflets. The scars thus left at the base of the leaflets are\r\nof a wedge-like form, and run spirally up the branch in a manner very\r\nlike those on the branches of lepidodendron; and it was accordingly\r\nsupposed at one time that the latter plant belonged, or at least was\r\nallied, to the conifers. But the branches of lepidodendron possessed a\r\npeculiarity that is shared in by none of our present coniferous trees.\r\nThey were what botanists call _dichotomous_,--that is, they subdivided\r\ninto two equal branches, these again into other two, and so on. Their\r\ninternal texture,[19] too, differed from that of any known conifer.\r\nThe only tribe of existing plants with which the lepidodendron seems\r\nto bear comparison, are the _Lycopodiaceæ_, or club-mosses, of which\r\nwe have several species in the moor-lands of our own country. They\r\nare low trailing plants, with moss-like scaly branches, bearing at\r\ntheir ends shaggy little tufts, whence the popular name of the genus.\r\nIn warmer climates, they are both more numerous and attain a larger\r\nsize, sometimes standing erect to about the height of an ordinary\r\ngooseberry-bush. But though the lepidodendron appears to have been\r\nallied to these plants in structure, it greatly differed from them in\r\ndimensions. The club-mosses of the coal-measures shot up as goodly\r\ntrees, measuring fifty feet and upwards in height, and sometimes\r\nnearly five in diameter. Their general effect must have been eminently\r\npicturesque. A shaggy covering of green spiky leaflets bristled over\r\ntheir multitudinous pendant boughs; and where on the older stems these\r\nleaflets had decayed and dropped off, the outer bark was laid bare,\r\nfretted over with rows of diamond-shaped or oval scars, separated\r\nby waving lines of ridge or furrow, that wound spirally round the\r\nstem. From not a few of the branches there sprang oblong hirsute\r\ncones called _lepidostrobi_ (Fig. 11), which bore the sporangia, or\r\nseed-cases. These cones are of frequent occurrence in the shales of\r\nthe coal-measures, and may be readily recognised. They had a central\r\naxis round which the oblong sporangia were built, the whole being\r\nprotected externally by a thick covering of pointed scales, imbricated\r\nlike the cone of the Scotch fir. The leaflets of lepidodendron, called\r\n_lepidophylla_, were broader than those of the Scotch fir, and had a\r\nstout mid-rib, which must have given them a rigidity like that of the\r\naraucarian pine a plant they may also have resembled in the dark glossy\r\ngreen of its leaves.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 19: See Hooker, _Mem. Geol. Surv._ vol. ii. part ii. p. 436.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig 10. Lepidodendron Sternbergii.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 11. Lepidostrobus.]\r\n\r\nOf all the common coal-measure plants, there is perhaps none so\r\nabundant as that known by the name of _stigmaria_, or punctured-stem.\r\nIt is found spreading out its rootlets for several yards in beds of\r\nshale and under-clay, and sometimes even limestone,[20] while, in\r\nmany sandstones, fragments of its blackened stems lie as thickly\r\nstrewn as twigs among the woods in autumn. I have said that several\r\nof the plants above described have greatly puzzled botanists. None\r\nof them, perhaps, has given rise to so much conjecture and variety\r\nof opinion as the stigmaria. The history of the discussion regarding\r\nits nature and affinities, would be not a little interesting as an\r\nillustration of the slow hindered progress often attendant on the\r\nresearches of science, and an instance of how a few simple facts are\r\nsometimes enough to overturn the most plausible theories and probable\r\nconjectures. Many thousands of specimens had been examined ere one was\r\nfound that revealed the true nature of the stigmaria. It was by some\r\nimagined to be a soft succulent marshy plant, consisting of a number\r\nof long branches radiating from a sort of soft disk, like spokes from\r\nthe centre of a wheel. Analogies were suggested with dicotyledonous\r\ntribes, as the _cacti_ and _euphorbiæ_, though it was at the same time\r\nadmitted that the ancient plant presented appearances which seemed very\r\nanomalous.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 20: The fresh-water limestone of Mid-Calder abounds in\r\nlong trailing stems and rootlets of stigmaria, mingled with other\r\nterrestrial plants, and shells of _cyprides_.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 12 Stigmaria rootlets springing from Sigillaria\r\nstem.]\r\n\r\nIn the course of an extensive survey of the coal-field of South\r\nWales, Mr. (now Sir William) Logan ascertained the important fact,\r\nthat each coal-seam is underlaid by a bed of clay, in which the stems\r\nof stigmaria, branching freely in all directions, may be traced to\r\nthe distance of many feet or even yards. They were recognised as\r\nundoubtedly occupying the site on which they grew, and consequently\r\neach coal-seam was held to rest upon an ancient soil. Some years\r\nafterwards, in making a cutting for the Lancaster and Bolton Railway,\r\nseveral upright massive stems belonging to a plant called _sigillaria_,\r\nwere found to pass downwards into true stigmaria stems (Fig. 12).\r\nThere could be no doubt that they were different parts of one and the\r\nsame plant. This fact has since been abundantly demonstrated from the\r\nNova Scotia coal-field. Many sigillariæ have been found there passing\r\ndown into the fire-clay below, where they branch out horizontally as\r\ntrue stigmatiæ. It is evident, therefore, that the stigmaria was the\r\nunder-ground portion of a plant, which, judging from the nature of the\r\nsoil, and the free mode in which the tender rootlets branched off,\r\nappears to have lived in aquatic or marshy stations.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 13. Stigmaria.]\r\n\r\nThe stigmaria is too well marked to be readily confounded with any\r\nother coal-measure plant. It had a rounded stem, seldom more than\r\nfour or five inches across, which was marked by a series of circular\r\ntubercules with a puncture in the centre, arranged in spiral lines\r\nround the stem. Each of these tubercules is surrounded, in ordinary\r\nspecimens, by a circular depression,[21] and the whole plant (if\r\none may use the comparison) looks as if it had been smitten with\r\nsmall-pox. From the hollow in the centre of each protuberance, there\r\nshot out a long round rootlet, formerly thought to be a leaf, and\r\nsince the tubercules are pretty thickly set, the stigmaria must have\r\nhad a somewhat hirsute appearance as it crept through the mud. It\r\nwould resemble a thick bearded stem of ivy, save that the fibres,\r\ninstead of running up two sides, were clustered all round it. Along\r\nthe centre of the root, there ran a woody pith of a harder and more\r\nenduring texture than the surrounding part of the plant. The space\r\nbetween the outer tuberculed rind and the inner pith, seems to have\r\nbeen of a soft cellular nature, and to have decayed first, for the pith\r\nis sometimes hollow, and may not unfrequently be seen at a distance\r\nfrom the centre, and almost at the outer bark--a circumstance that\r\nseems only explicable on the supposition, that while the surrounding\r\nportions were decaying, the firmer pith altered its position in the\r\nhollow stem, sinking to the lower side, if the plant lay prostrate, and\r\nthat it did not itself begin to decay until the interior of the stem\r\nhad been at least partially filled up with sand or mud, or fossilized\r\nby the infiltration of lime. From the root of the sigillaria, which\r\nhas a curious cross-shaped mark on its base, the stems of stigmaria\r\nstrike out horizontally, first as four great roots which subdivide as\r\nthey proceed. Their subdivisions are dichotomous, each root splitting\r\nequally into two, and thus they want that intricate interlacing of\r\nrootlet which is so familiar to us. The whole disposition of these\r\nunder-ground stems is singularly straight and regular, leading us to\r\nbelieve that they shot out freely through a soft muddy soil.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 21: Such is the usual aspect of the plant. But as the stems\r\nhave been, for the most part, greatly flattened by the pressure of\r\nthe superincumbent rocks, the sharpness of the pattern has been much\r\neffaced. In some specimens described by Dr. Hooker, as having been\r\nfound in an upright position, the external ornamentation presents an\r\nappearance somewhat different. What in the common specimens stand out\r\nas tubercules, are there seen to be deep circular cavities, in which\r\nthe shrunk flagon-shaped bases of the rootlets are still observable.\r\n(See above, Fig. 13 _b_, which is taken from one of Dr. Hooker's\r\nplates. For a detailed description of the structure of stigmaria, see\r\nthe paper above referred to in the _Geological Survey Memoirs_.) A\r\nvery ornate species is mentioned by the late Hugh Miller, in which\r\neach tubercule formed the centre of a sculptured star, and the whole\r\nstem seemed covered over with flowers of the composite order. And what\r\nis, perhaps, still more curious, the stem was seen to end off 7 in an\r\nobtuse point, tuberculed like the rest of the plant.--_Testimony of the\r\nRocks_, p. 461.]\r\n\r\nSome time ago I chanced to visit the remains of what had once been\r\na royal residence, and still looked majestic even in decay. It gave\r\na saddened pleasure to thread its winding stairs, and pass dreamily\r\nfrom chamber to hall, and chapel to closet; to stand in its gloomy\r\nkitchens, with their huge fire-places, whose blackened sides told of\r\nmany a roaring fagot that had ruddied merry faces in days long gone\r\nby; to creep stealthily into the sombre dungeons, so dank, earthy, and\r\ncold, and then winding cautiously back, to emerge into the light of the\r\nsummer sun. The silent quadrangle had its encircling walls pierced with\r\nmany a window, some of which had once been richly carved; but their\r\nmullions were now sorely wasted, while others, with broken lintels and\r\nshattered walls above, seemed only waiting for another storm to hurl\r\nthem among the roofless chambers below. In the centre of the court-yard\r\nstood a ruined fountain. It had been grotesquely ornamented with heads\r\nof lions and griffins, and was said to have once run red with wine. But\r\nit was silent enough now; the hand of time, and a still surer enemy,\r\nthe hand of man, had done their worst upon it; its groined arches\r\nand foliaged buttresses were broken and gone, and now its shattered\r\nbeauty stood in meet harmony with the desolation that reigned around.\r\nI employed myself for a while in looking over the fragments, marking\r\nnow the head of some fierce hippogryph, anon the limbs of some mimic\r\nknight clad in armour of proof, and ere long I stumbled on a delicately\r\nsculptured _fleur-de-lis_, that might have surmounted the toilet-window\r\nof some fair one of old. Turning it over, I found its unhewn side\r\nexhibited a still more delicately sculptured stigmaria. The incident\r\nwas certainly simple enough, perhaps even trifling. And yet, occurring\r\nin a spot that seemed consecrated to reverie, it awoke a train of\r\npleasant reflection. How wide the interval of time which was bridged\r\nacross in that sculptured stone! Its one side carried the mind back\r\nbut a few generations, the other hurried the fancy away over ages and\r\ncycles far into the dim shadows of a past eternity. The one told of a\r\nland of flowers, musical with the hum of the bee and the chantings of\r\nbirds, and gladdened by the presence of man; the other told of a land\r\nluxuriant, indeed, in strange forms of vegetation--huge club-mosses,\r\ntall calamites, and waving ferns--yet buried in a silence that was only\r\nbroken fitfully by the breeze as it shook the spiky catkins or the\r\ngiant fronds of the forest. The _fleur-de-lis_ recalled memories of\r\nFrance--the sunny land of France--which stood out so brightly in the\r\ndreams of our school-days; the stigmaria conjured up visions of a land\r\nthat was never gazed on by human eye, but rolled its rich champaign\r\nduring the long ages of the Carboniferous era, and sometimes rises up\r\ndimly in the dreams of our maturer years. Between these two epochs\r\nhow many centuries, how many cycles must have slowly rolled away! The\r\n_fleur-de-lis_ was carved but yesterday; the stigmaria flourished when\r\nthe earth was young, and had seen scarcely a third part of its known\r\nhistory.\r\n\r\nI have said that the stem of the stigmaria is called sigillaria.\r\nThe name may be translated _signet-stem_,[22] and has reference to\r\none of the distinguishing peculiarities of the plant. About twenty\r\nBritish species are enumerated, some of them very dissimilar, yet\r\nthey all agree in having long fluted stems with parallel rows of\r\nprominent seal-like tubercules. The sigillaria differed so widely in\r\nits whole contour and ornamentation from every living plant, that it\r\nis impossible to convey an idea of its form by reference to existing\r\nvegetation. Some of the species, as _S. organum_ (Fig. 14), had their\r\ntrunks traversed longitudinally by broad ridges separated by narrow\r\nfurrows. Along the summit of each ridge there ran a line of tubercules,\r\nset regularly at distances varying from a third or a quarter of an inch\r\nto close contact. One may sometimes see no unfair representation of\r\nthe bark of this ancient tree, when looking at a newly ploughed field\r\nin spring-time, having each of its broad ridges dotted with a row of\r\npotato sacks. Other species, while exhibiting the same plan, differed\r\nnot a little in the details. In some the tubercules are round, in\r\nothers angular, and in a third set double or kidney-shaped. In some\r\nthey are far apart, in others they are strung together like a chain of\r\nbeads. Sometimes they exist as mere specks, while occasionally they\r\nbroaden out so as to equal in width the ridge that supports them.\r\nOne species (_S. reniformis_), instead of the broad ridge and narrow\r\nfurrow, exhibits an arrangement exactly the reverse. It looks not\r\nunlike a cast of the species first described, save that its broad flat\r\nfurrows support rows of much larger tubercules. The breast of a lady's\r\nchemisette, with a thick-set row of buttons down each plait, would\r\nbe somewhat like this species of sigillaria, with this difference,\r\nhowever, that the buttons on the plant were of a form that does not\r\nappear as yet to have come into fashion among the fair sex. Yet they\r\nhad no little elegance, and like many other objects in the geological\r\nstorehouse, might be a useful model for our students of design. They\r\nwere neither round nor quite oval, but rather of a kidney-shape, or\r\nlike a double cherry.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 22: The word sigillaria is really plural, and was used by the\r\nRomans to denote the little images which friends were wont to present\r\nto each other at the end of the Saturnalia. They answered pretty nearly\r\nto christmas-boxes and new year's gifts among ourselves. It is not\r\nuninteresting thus to find among the hard dry names of science, one\r\nthat two thousand years ago was synonymous with all the kindliness of\r\nfriendship.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 14. Sigillaria, with black carbonized bark\r\npartially removed.]\r\n\r\nThere can be no doubt that these tubercules must once have supported\r\nleaflets. They are true leaf-scars, like those on the Scotch fir, and\r\nthe lozenge-shaped knobs on the bark of lepidodendron. But of the form\r\nof these leaves we are still in ignorance, for no part of the plant,\r\nsave the stem and roots, has yet been found. The sigillaria must have\r\nbeen a tree that could not long withstand maceration, for not only are\r\nits leaves gone, but, in many cases, the outer bark has partially or\r\nwholly decayed, leaving a scarcely distinguishable mass of carbonized\r\nmatter.[23] When this outer rind is peeled off, the inner surface of\r\nthe stem is seen to be ridged, furrowed, and tuberculed in the same\r\nway, but the markings are much less distinct than on the outside. The\r\nbark sometimes attains the thickness of an inch, and is always found\r\nas a layer of pure coal enveloping the stem where it stands erect, or\r\nlying as a flat cake without any central cylinder where the stem is\r\nprostrate. (See Fig. 14.)\r\n\r\n[Footnote 23: Another proof of the looseness of the texture of this\r\nancient vegetable may be gathered from the almost invariable truncation\r\nof even the largest erect stems; they are snapped across at the height\r\nof a few feet from their base. The famous \"Torbanehill Mineral\"\r\ncontains many such fragmentary stems, often of considerable thickness.\r\nTheir interior consists of the same material as the surrounding bed,\r\nand displays many dissevered plants that may have been washed into\r\nthe decaying trunks. For the internal structure of sigillaria see Dr\r\nHooker's _Memoir_, and the authorities therein cited.]\r\n\r\nAnother remarkable feature in this carboniferous plant is that it\r\nappears to have had no branches along its stem. Trunks have been found\r\nfour and five feet in diameter, and have been traced to a distance of\r\nfifty, sixty, and even seventy feet, without any marks of branches\r\nbeing detected. Brongniart examined the portion of one stem, which,\r\nat its thicker end, had been broken across, but still measured a\r\nfoot in breadth. It ran for forty feet along the gallery of a mine,\r\nnarrowing to a width of not more than six inches, when it divided into\r\ntwo, each branch measuring about four inches across. The sigillaria\r\nstems, accordingly, must have shot up, slim and straight, to a height\r\nof sometimes seventy feet before they threw out a single branch. We\r\nknow nothing of the coronal of these strangely-formed trees. From\r\nBrongniart's observations, it would seem that the upper part of the\r\nstem, like that of the lepidodendron, was dichotomous, that is, it\r\nbranched out into two minor stems; but how these were disposed is\r\nunknown. We are wholly ignorant, too, of the foliage of these branches,\r\nthough, from the general structure of the plant, as well as from the\r\nnumber of fern-fronds often found around the base of the stems, it has\r\nbeen conjectured that the sigillaria was cryptogamous, and, like the\r\ntree-ferns, supported a group of sweeping fronds. If so, it differed in\r\nmany respects from every known member of the cryptogamic tribes.\r\n\r\nPutting together, then, all that we know of the exterior of the\r\nsigillaria, we find that it was a tall slender tree, with, palm-like,\r\na clump of foliaged branches above, its stem bristling thickly, in at\r\nleast its upper part, with spiky leaves, and its roots equally hirsute,\r\nshooting out to a distance of sometimes forty feet through the soft\r\nmuddy soil. Future researches may bring us better acquainted with this\r\nancient organism. In the meanwhile, enough of it is known to mark it\r\nout as one of the most ornate forms of vegetation that the world has\r\never seen.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the above, the coal strata have yielded many other\r\nfragmentary remains, to which names have been given, but of which very\r\nlittle is known. It is pleasant, amid such a wide sea of doubt and\r\nuncertainty, to alight upon some well-known form of whose affinities\r\nthere can be no question, since it still finds its representatives in\r\nliving nature. Of such a kind are the coniferous stems occasionally met\r\nwith in the sandstones of the coal-measures. .\r\n\r\nIt is now many years since the operations of the quarryman in the\r\ncarboniferous sandstones of Edinburgh and Newcastle disclosed the\r\nremains of huge gnarled trunks deeply imbedded in the rock. The\r\nneighbourhood of the latter town yielded, in 1829,[24] the stem of\r\na tree seventy-two feet long, without branches, but roughened with\r\nnumerous knobs, indicative of the places whence branches had sprung.\r\nAt Craigleith, near Edinburgh, a trunk thirty-six feet long, and three\r\nfeet in diameter at the base, was disinterred in the year 1826. Since\r\nthen, several others have been found in the same neighbourhood; some\r\nof them sixty and even seventy feet in length, and from two to six in\r\nbreadth. They were, for the most part, stripped of roots and branches,\r\nand lay at a greater or less angle among the white sandstone beds,\r\nwhich they cut across obliquely. It was unknown for some time to what\r\ndivision of the vegetable kingdom these trunks should be referred.\r\nTheir irregular branched surface and undoubted bark indicated a higher\r\nkind of structure than that possessed by any of the other carboniferous\r\nplants; but the conjecture remained unverified until an ingenious\r\nand beautiful method was discovered of investigating their internal\r\norganization. Two Edinburgh geologists, Mr. Nichol and Mr. Witham,\r\nsucceeded in obtaining slices of the plants sufficiently transparent to\r\nbe viewed under the microscope by transmitted light, and in this way\r\ntheir true structure was readily perceived. The method of preparing\r\nthese objects was simply as follows:--A thin slice of the plant to be\r\nstudied was cut by the lapidary, or detached by the hammer. One side\r\nhaving been ground down smooth, and polished, was cemented by Canada\r\nbalsam to a piece of plate-glass, and the upper surface was then ground\r\ndown and polished in like manner, so as to leave the slice no thicker\r\nthan cartridge-paper.[25] When the preparation was then placed under\r\na magnifying power, the minute cells and woody fibre of the plant\r\ncould be detected as clearly as those of a recent tree. The Craigleith\r\nfossils were in this way recognised as belonging to the great\r\nconiferous family, and to that ancient[26] division of it which is, at\r\nthe present day, represented by the pine of Norfolk Island--\"a noble\r\naraucarian, which rears its proud head from 160 to 200 feet over the\r\nsoil, and exhibits a green and luxuriant breadth of foliage rare among\r\nthe coniferæ.\"[27] Some of these plants have yielded faint traces of\r\nthe annual rings shown so markedly in the cross section of our common\r\nforest-trees; whence it would appear, that even as far back as the\r\ntimes of the coal-measures, there were seasons of alternate heat and\r\ncold, though probably less defined than now.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 24: Witham's _Foss. Veget._ p. 31.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 25: For a more detailed description of the process, see\r\nWitham's _Foss. Veget._ p. 45.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 26: The solitary lignite of the Lower Old Red Sandstone,\r\nseems to have been araucarian. Miller's _Footprints of the Creator_, p.\r\n203.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 27: _Footprints of the Creator_, p. 192.]\r\n\r\nThese coniferous trees do not appear to occur among the erect stems of\r\nthe coal-beds, at least they are very rare in such a position. Their\r\nmore usual appearance is that of drifted, branchless trunks, imbedded\r\nalong with other fragmentary plants in deep strata of sandstone.\r\nThey probably grew on higher ground than the swamps which supported\r\nthe sigillariæ and their allies, and might have been carried down by\r\nstreams, freighted out to sea, and so deposited among the sediment that\r\nwas gathering at the bottom.\r\n\r\nThe remains of cycadaceous plants have been described among the\r\nvegetation of the coal-measures; but only fragments have as yet been\r\nfound. The modern _Cycadeæ_ are low shrubs or trees, with thick stems\r\nof nearly uniform breadth, crowned with a dense clump of spreading\r\nfronds which resemble both those of the palms and the ferns. They are\r\nnatives of the warmer regions of both hemispheres.\r\n\r\nSo long ago as the year 1835, Dr. Lindley figured a flower-like\r\nplant, to which he gave the name of _Antholites_, ranking it among\r\nthe _Bromeliaceæ_, or pine-apple group. It was afterwards suspected\r\nby Dr. Hooker to belong rather to the coniferæ; and he supposed that\r\nthe so-called flowerets might be really tufts of young unexpanded\r\nleaves. An examination of a more perfect specimen, however, has induced\r\nthat distinguished botanist to alter his convictions and return to\r\nthe original decision of Lindley, that the antholites are really\r\nflowers.[28] In Fig. 15, therefore, which represents one of these\r\ncoal-measure fossils, the reader beholds the oldest flower that has\r\nyet been found; and surely it is of no little interest to know, that\r\namid the rank, steaming forests of the Carboniferous era, with all\r\ntheir darkness and gloom, there were at least some flowers--flowers,\r\ntoo, that were allied to still living forms, and breathed out a rich\r\naromatic fragrance.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 28: See Dr. Hooker's remarks in the Supplement to the fifth\r\nedition of Lyell's Manual, p. 31.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 15.--Antholites.]\r\n\r\nIn fine, from all the genera and species of plants that have been\r\ndetected in the strata of the coal-measures, it would appear that the\r\nflora of that ancient period was in a high degree _acrogenous_--that\r\nis to say, consisted in great measure of ferns, club-mosses, and other\r\nmembers of the great group of plants known as _acrogens_. This word\r\nliterally means _top-growers_, and is applied to those plants which\r\nincrease in height, but not in width, since they attain at first\r\nnearly their ultimate diameter. Such plants occupy a low position in\r\nthe botanical scale. Mingled with the numerous genera of carboniferous\r\nferns and club-mosses, we find the remains of a much higher grade\r\nof vegetation--that of the _gymnogens_, or plants that bear naked\r\nseeds--such as the firs and pines. There also seem to have been a\r\nfew _endogenous_ flowering plants. Viewing, then, this flora on the\r\nwhole, it presents us with many striking resemblances to certain\r\nbotanical regions of the present day. Many of the tropical islands\r\nabound in ferns, and contain very few flowering plants. But New Zealand\r\naffords perhaps the closest parallel. That island is in certain parts\r\nhighly mountainous, its loftiest summits being covered with glaciers.\r\nThe hills throughout large districts are bare, or covered with a\r\nscanty herbage, while in other localities they are densely clothed\r\nwith forests of pine, beech, and other trees. These forests sweep\r\non to the lower grounds, where they are replaced by a thick growth\r\nof fern and flax-plant intermingled with dragon-trees and graceful\r\ntree-ferns, while the more swampy regions support a rich profusion of\r\nreeds and rushes. Such a condition of things affords a close parallel\r\nto the probable vegetation of the Carboniferous period--an immense\r\npreponderance of ferns and arborescent acrogens, with an intermixture\r\nof large coniferous trees. From the general scantiness of a flora\r\nwhere ferns predominate, it has been argued that the swamps of the\r\ncoal-measures nourished a luxuriant repetition of comparatively few\r\nspecies; and this hypothesis also receives confirmation from the\r\nvegetation of New Zealand. Another deduction founded on the resemblance\r\nof the ancient to the modern flora, refers to the conditions of heat\r\nand moisture. It has been inferred that the climate of the coal period\r\nwas equable and humid, like that of New Zealand--a supposition much\r\nmore natural and simple than that, once so much in vogue, of a heated\r\natmosphere densely charged with carbonic acid gas. That the air of the\r\nCarboniferous period differed in no material respect from the air of\r\nthe present day, seems at last proved by the remains of air-breathing\r\nanimals having been found among the coal-beds; and there seems no\r\nreason why the higher mountain-tops of the same epoch may not have been\r\nclothed with glaciers as those of New Zealand are. As yet we have no\r\nevidence of the fact, but it is by no means beyond the possibility of\r\nproof.[29]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 29: See Professor Ramsay's suggestive Memoir on Permian\r\nBreccias in _Quarterly Journal of the Geological Society_, vol. xi. p.\r\n185.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Scenery of the carboniferous forests--Contrast in the\r\n       appearance of coal districts at the present day--Abundance\r\n       of animal life in the Carboniferous era--Advantages\r\n       of palæontology over fossil-botany--Carboniferous\r\n       fauna--Actiniæ--Cup-corals--Architecture of the present\r\n       day might be improved by study of the architecture of the\r\n       Carboniferous period--Mode of propagation of corals--A\r\n       forenoon on the beach--Various stages in the decomposition of\r\n       shells--Sea-mat--Bryozoa--Fenestella--Retepora--Stone-lilies--\r\n       Popular superstitions--Structure of the stone-lilies--Aspect\r\n       of the sea-bottom on which the stone-lilies\r\n       flourished--Sea-urchins--Crustacea, their high\r\n       antiquity--Cyprides--Architecture of the Crustacea and\r\n       mollusca contrasted--King-crabs.\r\n\r\nThe forms of vegetation that flourished during the Carboniferous era\r\nseem to have been in large measure marshy plants, luxuriating on low\r\nmuddy delta-lands, like the cypress-swamps of the Mississippi, or the\r\nSunderbunds of the Ganges. We can picture but faintly the general\r\nscenery of these old forests from the broken and carbonized remains\r\nthat have come down to us. But though perhaps somewhat monotonous\r\non the whole, it must have been eminently beautiful in detail. The\r\nsigillariæ raised their sculptured stems and lofty waving wreaths of\r\nfronds high over the more swampy grounds, while a thick underwood of\r\nferns and star-leaved asterophyllites clustered amid the shade below.\r\nThe lepidodendra shot forth their spiky branches from the margin of\r\ngreen islets, and dropped their catkins into the sluggish water that\r\nstole on among the dimpled shadows underneath. Tree-ferns spread out\r\ntheir broad pendant fronds, and wrapt the ground below in an almost\r\ntwilight gloom, darker and deeper far than that\r\n\r\n          \"Hospitable roof\r\n    Of branching elms star-proof,\"\r\n\r\nwhich rose so often in the visions of Milton; or that \"graceful arch\"\r\nso exquisitely sung by Cowper, beneath which\r\n\r\n    \"The chequered earth seems restless as a flood\r\n    Brushed by the wind. So sportive is the light\r\n    Shot; through the boughs, it dances as they dance,\r\n    Shadow and sunshine intermingling quick,\r\n    And darkening and enlightening, as the leaves\r\n    Play wanton, every moment, every spot.\"\r\n\r\nThickets of tall reeds rose out of the water, with stems massive as\r\nthose of our forest-trees, encircled at regular distances by wreaths of\r\npointed leaflets, and bearing on their summits club-like catkins. Far\r\naway, the distant hills lay shaggy with pine-woods, and nursed in their\r\nsolitudes the springs and rivulets that worked a devious course through\r\nforest, and glen, and valley, until, united into one broad river, they\r\ncrept through the rich foliage of the delta and finally passed away out\r\nto sea, bearing with them a varied burden of drift-wood, pine-trees\r\nfrom the hills, and stray leaves and cones from the lower grounds.\r\n\r\nHow different such a scene from that now presented by the very same\r\nareas of country! These old delta lands are now our coal-fields, and\r\nhave exchanged the deep stillness of primeval nature for the din and\r\nturmoil of modern mining districts. In these ancient times, not only\r\nwas man uncreated, but the earth as yet lacked all the higher types of\r\nvertebrated being. None of the animals that we see around us existed\r\nthen; there were no sheep, nor oxen, horses, deer, nor dogs. Neither\r\nwere the quadrupeds of other lands represented; the forests nourished\r\nno lions or tigers, no wolves or bears, no opossums or kangaroos. In\r\ntruth, the land must have been a very silent one, for we know as yet of\r\nno animated existence that could break the stillness, save perchance\r\nsome chirping grasshopper, or droning beetle, or quivering dragon-fly.\r\nNo bee hummed along on errands of industry; it is doubtful, indeed,\r\nwhether honey-yielding flowers formed part of the carboniferous flora;\r\nno lark carolled blithely in the sky, nor rook croaked among the\r\nwoods. All was still; and one might, perhaps, have stood on some of\r\nthose tree-crested islets, and heard no sound but the rippling of the\r\nwater along the reedy and sedgy banks, and the rustling of the gloomy\r\nbranches overhead.\r\n\r\nTo one who muses on these bygone ages it is no unimpressive situation\r\nto stand in the midst of a large coal district and mark its smoking\r\nchimneys, clanking engines, and screaming locomotives, its squalid\r\nvillages and still more squalid inhabitants, and its mingled air of\r\ncommercial activity, physical wretchedness, and moral degradation.\r\nIt is from such a point of view that we receive the most forcible\r\nillustration of those great changes whereof every country has been the\r\nscene, and which are so tersely expressed by one who has gazed on the\r\nrevelations of geology with the eye of a true poet--\r\n\r\n    \"There rolls the deep where grew the tree.\r\n      O earth, what changes hast thou seen!\r\n      There where the long street roars, bath been\r\n    The stillness of the central sea.\"\r\n\r\nBut the lifelessness of the carboniferous forests was amply compensated\r\nby the activity that reigned in river, lagoon, and sea. Coral groves\r\ngleamed white beneath the waves, fishes of many a shape disported in\r\nstream and lake, and the bulkier forms, armed in massive plates of\r\nbone, ascended the rivers or haunted the deeper recesses of the open\r\nsea. In some beds of rock the remains of these various animals lie\r\ncrowded together like drifted tangle on the sea-shore, and the whole\r\nreminds us of a vast cemetery or charnel-house. The bones lie at all\r\nangles, many of them broken and disjointed as though the owner had died\r\nat a distance, and his remains, sadly mutilated on the way, had been\r\nborne to their last resting-place by the shifting currents; others\r\nlie all in place, covered with their armature of scales, as though\r\nthe creature, conscious of approaching dissolution, had sought out a\r\nsheltered nook and there lain down and died. It is not uninteresting\r\nor uninstructive to tract; out in an old quarry stratum above stratum,\r\neach with its groups of once living things. I know of few employments\r\nmore pleasant than to sit there, amid the calm stillness of a summer\r\nevening, when the shadows are beginning to steal along the valleys and\r\ncreep up the hill-sides, and in that dim fading light to try in fancy\r\nto clothe these dry bones with life, to picture the time when they\r\nlived and moved in the glassy depths of lakes and seas, or amid the\r\nsolitudes of jungles and forests, and so to spend a pleasant hour in\r\nreverie, till roused at last by the vesper song of the lark, or the low\r\nmeanings of the night wind as it sighs mournfully through the woods.\r\n\r\nThe study of fossil animals embraces a much greater range of subject\r\nthan that of fossil plants. The _fauna_ of any particular geological\r\nformation, that is to say, its embedded animal remains, for the most\r\npart vastly exceeds in number its _flora_, or vegetable remains, and is\r\nlikewise usually better preserved. About the nature and affinities of\r\nseveral tribes of fossil plants there hangs an amount of uncertainty\r\nwhich renders them a dubious guide to the climatal and other conditions\r\nof the period and locality in which they lived. Generic distinctions\r\namong living plants often rest on the character of those parts which\r\nare the most perishable, such as flowers and seed-vessels. These\r\ndelicate structures we, of course, can hardly look to find preserved\r\nin the rocks, and we have in place of them only detached leaflets,\r\ntwigs, branches, and stems, often sorely mutilated in outward form, and\r\npresenting no trace of internal organization. But the tribes of the\r\nanimal kingdom have, for the most part, harder frameworks. The minute\r\ninfusoria, which by their accumulated remains help to choke up the\r\ndelta of the Nile, and swarm by millions in every ocean of the globe,\r\nhave their silicious or calcareous shells so minute that Ehrenberg\r\nhas estimated a cubic inch of tripoli to contain forty-one thousand\r\nmillions of them. The polypi have their internal calcareous skeletons,\r\nwhich abound in all the older limestones, and form the coral reefs of\r\nthe present day. The mollusca, too, though, as their name imports, they\r\nhave perishable bodies, are yet, in most cases, furnished with hard\r\ncalcareous shells, that indicate by their various modifications of form\r\nand structure, the character of the animal that lived within them. They\r\nare found in all the formations from the earliest upwards, and as they\r\nvastly exceed in numbers all the other classes with which the geologist\r\nhas to deal, they form the larger part of that basis of evidence from\r\nwhich he interprets the past history of organized existence. Hugh\r\nMiller loved to talk of them as the \"shell alphabet,\" out of which the\r\nlanguage of palæontological history should be compiled. The vertebrata,\r\ntoo, all have their hard skeletons, easily capable of preservation,\r\nwhether it be in the form of the massive exo-skeleton of bone that\r\ncharacterized the older ganoidal fishes, or the compact endo-skeleton\r\nof the reptiles and mammals. A greater amount of attention is,\r\ntherefore, due to the study of fossil animals, since they thus not\r\nonly far exceed fossil plants in number, but possess a higher value as\r\nevidence of ancient physical conditions.\r\n\r\nThe _fauna_ of the Carboniferous system is a very numerous one,\r\nexhibiting specimens of almost every class of animal life, from the\r\ntiny _foraminifer_ up to the massive bone-covered sauroidal fish,\r\nand even to occasional traces of true reptilian remains. By far the\r\nlarger number are peculiar to the sea, such as the molluscan tribes\r\nand corals; others are undoubtedly terrestrial organisms, such as the\r\nwings and wing-sheaths of several kinds of insects; while some appear\r\nto be peculiar to fresh or brackish water, such as shells allied to\r\nour _unio_ or river-mussel, and minute crustaceous animals known as\r\n_cyprides_, of which we have still representatives in our ponds and\r\nditches. It is plain, then, that if we rightly ascertain the class or\r\nfamily to which one of these fossils belonged, we shall obtain a clue\r\nto the history of the physical geography, during Carboniferous times,\r\nof the district in which the fossil occurs. A bed of unios will tell\r\nus of old rivers and lakes that spread out their blue waters where\r\nnow, perchance, there lie waving fields of corn. A bed of corals and\r\nstone-lilies will lay before us the bottom of an ancient ocean that\r\nrolled its restless waves where to-day, perhaps, the quarryman plies\r\nhis task amid the gloom of dark pine-woods. In short, these organic\r\nremains are to the history of the earth what ancient monuments are to\r\nthe history of man. They enable us to trace out the varied changes\r\nof our planet and its inhabitants down to the human era, just as the\r\nwooden canoe, the flint arrow-head, the stone coffin, the bronze sword,\r\nthe iron cuirass, the ruined abbey, and the feudal castle, teach us the\r\nsuccessive stages of progress in the history of our own country.\r\n\r\nWhoever has spent a few days on some rocky coast, must have noticed\r\nadhering to half-tide stones numerous solitary _actiniæ_. Arrayed in\r\nall the colours of the rainbow--purple, green, and gold--these little\r\ncreatures hang out their tentacles like so many flowers, and have hence\r\nreceived the popular name of sea-anemones. Their internal structure is\r\nno less beautiful. They resemble so many large plump gooseberries, and\r\nconsist of a little sack suspended within a larger one. The outer sack\r\nis fringed along its upper edges with one or more rows of slim hollow\r\ntentacles, which diverge outwards like the petals of the daisy, and can\r\nbe contracted at pleasure so as somewhat to resemble the daisy when\r\nfolded up at sunset. The inner sack, which forms the stomach of the\r\nanimal, has a short opening or gullet, at the upper part of which is\r\nthe mouth lying in the centre of the cavity surrounded by the fringes\r\nof tentacles. The inner sack is connected with the outer by means of\r\nthin membranes, like so many partition-walls, which radiate inwards\r\nlike spokes towards the axle of a wheel. The space between each of\r\nthese membranes, or lamellæ, forms an independent chamber, but it has\r\na communication with those on either side by a window in each wall,\r\nand further opens upwards into the hollow tentacles, which, with minute\r\norifices at their outer points, may be compared to chimneys. These\r\nchambers form the breathing apparatus of the little creature. Sea-water\r\npasses down through the tentacle into the hollow chamber below,\r\nwhence, by the constant action of minute hairlike cilia that line the\r\nwalls like tapestry, it is driven through the window into the next\r\nchamber, thence into the next, and so on, passing gradually through the\r\ntentacles back to the sea.\r\n\r\nThe actiniæ are of a soft perishable substance, but many of the other\r\n_Anthozoa_, or flower-like animals, have hard calcareous skeletons. Of\r\nsuch a kind are the polypi that in the Pacific Ocean have raised those\r\nstupendous reefs and islands of coral. It does not appear that, during\r\nthe Carboniferous period, there existed any reef-building zoophytes,\r\nbut some of the most abundant forms of life belonged to a kindred\r\ntribe, and are known by the name of _Cyathophyllidæ_, or cup-corals.\r\n\r\nAs the name imports, the typical genus has a general cup-shaped form,\r\nbut this is liable to many aberrations in the cognate genera. The\r\nyounger specimens of one species (_Cyathopsis fungites_) have a curved\r\noutline somewhat like the bowl of a tobacco-pipe, whence the quarrymen\r\nknow them as pipe-heads. The older individuals are generally more or\r\nless wrinkled and twisted, sometimes reaching a length of eight or nine\r\ninches, and have been named by the workmen _rams'-horns_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 16.--Cyathopsis (clisiophyllum ?) fungites.]\r\n\r\nThe annexed figure (Fig. 16) shows their general appearance and\r\nstructure. The lower end was fixed to the rock like the flat\r\nsucker-like disc of the actinia. Around the outer margin there diverged\r\none or more rows of slim tentacles, hollow, soft, and retractile, like\r\nthose of the actinia. From the margin to the centre there radiated\r\nmore than a hundred lamellæ, but these differed from the corresponding\r\nmembranes of the modern animal, inasmuch as they were strengthened\r\ninternally by a skeleton of hard carbonate of lime; and to this\r\ndifference we owe their preservation. They stand out in high relief\r\nupon weathered specimens, showing the long, narrow chambers that ran\r\nbetween them. Their walls were once doubtless hung with countless\r\nvibratile cilia, and perhaps pierced each with its window, through\r\nwhich the currents of water passed in their ceaseless progress to and\r\nfrom the sea. At the centre lay the mouth, communicating by a short\r\ngullet with the stomach, which occupied the central portion of the\r\nanimal, and from the outer walls of which the lamellæ diverged like so\r\nmany buttresses. In its youngest stages, the animal occupied the whole\r\nlength of the cup, but, us it increased in size, it gradually retreated\r\nfrom the narrow end, which was then divided off by a thin calcareous\r\nmembrane. At each successive stage of its growth, a new membrane was\r\nadded, each further and further from the lower end, so that eventually\r\nthe creature left below it a series of empty chambers all firmly\r\nbuilt up. Thus, in a specimen six or eight inches long, there would\r\nin reality only be a small part tenanted--in fact merely the upper\r\nfloor--all the lower storeys remaining silent and uninhabited. The\r\nhouse of this old-world architect differed widely in one respect from\r\nhuman dwellings. Man begins his basement story of the same dimensions\r\nas those that are to succeed it, or, if any difference is made at all,\r\nthe upper floors are built each less than the one below it, so that\r\nthe whole structure tapers upward to a point, as in the Pyramids. But\r\nthe cyathopsis reversed this latter process; it inverted the cone,\r\ncommencing the smallest chamber at the bottom, and placing the widest\r\nat the top. Indeed, one is sometimes puzzled to conjecture how so bulky\r\na building could be securely poised on so narrow a basis, and it is\r\ncertainly difficult to see how the creature could move about with such\r\na ponderous load to drag along. The snail carries his house on his\r\nback, yet it is a slim structure at the best; but the cup-coral must\r\nnot merely have carried his house, but some dozen or two of old ones\r\nstrung one after another to his tail. Perhaps, though free to move\r\nabout and try change of residence in its youthful days, the creature\r\ngradually settled down in life, and took up its permanent abode in some\r\nfavourite retreat, the more especially as in process of time it became\r\nwhat we should call a very respectable householder.\r\n\r\nAllied to the cyathopsis is another and still more beautiful coral,\r\ndescribed so long ago as the latter part of the seventeenth century\r\nby the Welsh antiquary and naturalist, Lhwyd, under the name of\r\n_Lithostrotion_. Although many perfect specimens of it have been\r\nfound, and it is usually as well preserved as any of its congeners,\r\nmen of science have been sadly at a loss what to call it. Four or\r\nfive synonyms may be found applied to it in different works on\r\npalæontology. There seems now, however, a tendency to return to the\r\nname that old Lhwyd gave it two centuries ago; the family to which\r\nit belongs, and of which it is the type, has accordingly been termed\r\nthe _Lithostrotionidæ_, and the species in question _Lithostrotion\r\nstriatum_ (Fig. 17). It differed from the cyathopsis in several\r\nrespects, but chiefly in this, that it lived in little congregated\r\ngroups or colonies, whereas the cyathopsis, like our own actinia, dwelt\r\nalone.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 17.--Lithostrotion striatum.]\r\n\r\nEach of these colonies was formed of a cluster of hexagonal, or rather\r\npolygonal pillars, fitting closely into each other, like the basaltic\r\ncolumns of Fingal's Cave, and springing from a common base at the sea\r\nbottom.[30] Each pillar constituted the abode of a single animal,\r\nand resembled generally the stalk of the cyathopsis. It had the same\r\nminute diverging partitions running from the outer walls towards the\r\ncentre, and the same thin diaphragms, which, stretching horizontally\r\nacross the interior of the column at short intervals, marked the\r\nsuccessive stages of the animal's growth. Within these partitions,\r\nwhich vary from forty to eighty in number, there runs an inner circular\r\ntube with thin lamellæ and diaphragms. The exterior of the columns is\r\nribbed longitudinally by a set of long fine striæ, which give somewhat\r\nthe appearance of the fluting on a Corinthian pillar. The columns,\r\nmoreover, are not straight, but have an irregular, wrinkled outline,\r\nso that, by a slant light, they look like some old pillar formed of\r\nmany layers of stone, the joints of which have wasted away, producing\r\nan undulating profile in place of the original even one. But in these\r\nancient coral columns there is no blunted outline, no worn hollow;\r\nthe sculpturing stands out as sharp and fresh, and the wavy curves as\r\nclearly defined, as though the creature had died but yesterday. They\r\nresemble no order of human architecture, save faintly, perhaps, some of\r\nthe wavy outlines of the Arabesque.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 30: Sir Roderick Murchison figures in his _Siluria_, p. 282,\r\na gigantic specimen, which measured two feet four inches in width.]\r\n\r\nDespite all the improvements and inventions of modern times, classic\r\narchitecture has made no progress since the days of Pericles. All that\r\nwe do now is but to reproduce what the Greeks created 2000 years ago,\r\nand he is reckoned the best architect who furnishes the best imitation.\r\nOur architects might find some useful hints, however, by studying the\r\nlowlier orders of nature. They would see there patterns of beauty far\r\nmore delicate than the Grecian capital, and more light and airy than\r\nthe Gothic shaft. And whether or not they could found a new order of\r\narchitecture, they could not fail to discover many modifications and\r\nimprovements upon some of the old. They could not readily light upon\r\na more graceful form than that of the lithostrotion, would they but\r\npicture it as it grew at the bottom of the old carboniferous sea. A\r\ngroup of hexagonal pillars, firmly compacted together like those of\r\nthe Giant's Causeway, or Fingal's Cave, rose from a white calcareous\r\npediment, as columns from the marble steps of an Athenian temple. Each\r\nside of the pillar had a wavy undulating surface, delicately fluted by\r\nlong slender striæ, the whole being so arranged that the convexities\r\nof one surface fitted into the sinuosities of the adhering one. Each\r\npillar was crowned above by a capital, consisting of the soft vibratile\r\ntentacles of the animal, that hung over like so many acanthus leaves.\r\nOf the form of these tentacles, their design and grouping, we know\r\nnothing save what may be gathered from the analogy of living corals.\r\nThere can be little doubt, however, that, like the flower-shaped buds\r\nof the existing reef-building polyps, they must have been eminently\r\nbeautiful, and in strict keeping with the graceful column which they\r\ncrowned.\r\n\r\nAnother kindred form was that known as the _lithodendron_. It, too,\r\ngrew in colonies, and seems to have closely resembled the last, save\r\nthat the pillars, in place of being six-sided, were round. I have seen\r\na bed of these corals several yards in extent, and seven or eight\r\ninches deep, where the individuals were closely crowded together, so\r\nas to resemble a series of tobacco-pipe stems, or slim pencils set on\r\nend. The tubes, however, were not all quite straight; many being more\r\nor less curved, and sometimes crossing their neighbours obliquely.\r\nThe internal arrangement was on the same plan as in the two previous\r\ncorals. The same numerous partitions ran from the exterior wall\r\ntowards the central tube, the same thick-set diaphragms crossed the\r\nentire breadth of the column, imparting the same minute honey-combed\r\nappearance to a cross section. The exterior of the column (in _L.\r\nfasciculatum_) was likewise traversed by the same longitudinal striæ.\r\n\r\nBoth these corals seem to have been _fissiparous_, that is to say, they\r\npropagated by splitting into two parts, each of which formed the base\r\nof a new column with a new animal. The evidence for this statement\r\nrests on the fact, that many of the tubes are seen to bifurcate in\r\ntheir course, so that two new tubes are produced equal in size and\r\ncompleteness to the old one from which they proceed. Another mode of\r\ngeneration which, in at least its earlier stages, would produce a\r\nsomewhat similar appearance is called _gemmation_, and consists in\r\nthe protrusion of a bud or gemmule from the side of the animal, which\r\nshortly develops into a new and perfect individual. It is probable,\r\nhowever, that the ordinary mode of propagation among these old corals\r\nwas the usual one by impregnated ova. These ova, like those of our\r\nsea-anemones, were probably generated within the partitions, between\r\nthe central stomach and the outer wall, whence they passed down into\r\nthe stomach, and were ejected by the mouth of the parent as little\r\ngemmules, furnished with the power of locomotion by means of vibratile\r\ncilia. Some of the _Medusa_ family possess this three-fold mode of\r\npropagation; but, in all, the last-mentioned is the most usual.\r\n\r\nHas the reader ever stretched himself along the shore, while, perhaps,\r\na July sun blazed overhead, and a fitful breeze came over the sea, just\r\nstrong enough to chase ashore an endless series of rippling wavelets,\r\nand breathe over his temples a delicious and refreshing coolness?\r\nThus placed, and gazing dreamily now, perchance, at the distant sails\r\nlike white specks along the boundary line of sea and sky; now at the\r\ngulls wheeling in broad circles through the air, and shooting swift\r\nas arrows down into the blue water, he must often have turned to look\r\nfor a little at the sand which, heaped up in little mounds around him,\r\nformed a couch well-nigh as soft as the finest down. Many a varied\r\nfragment entered into the composition of that sand. Mingled among the\r\nminuter quartzy particles lay scores of shells, some with the colour\r\nnot yet faded, and the valves still together--the delicate tellina,\r\nwith its polished surface, and its flush of pink; the cardium with its\r\nstrong white plaited sides, and the turritella with its circling spire;\r\nsome were worn down and sorely effaced, others broken into fragments\r\nby the ceaseless grinding of the waves. It was pleasant labour in such\r\na sultry noon to pick out the shells of one species in all stages of\r\ndecay. The _Trochus lineatus_, or Silver Willie, as young ramblers by\r\nthe sea-shore love to call it, showed well the process of destruction.\r\nThe perfect shell, cast ashore, perhaps, by the last storm, and still\r\nuninjured by the tides, displayed its russet epidermis, or outer skin,\r\ncovered with fine brown zig-zag lines, running across the whorls from\r\nthe creature's wide pearl-lined mouth to the apex. A second shell\r\nexhibited a surface that had begun to suffer; the point had been\r\ndivested of its thin outer skin, and laid bare the silvery coating of\r\npearl below. A third had undergone a still longer period of abrasion,\r\nfor the whole of the epidermis was gone, and the surface gleamed with\r\na pearly iridescence. In yet a fourth, this bright exterior had been\r\nin large measure worn away, and the blunted, rounded shell displayed\r\nthe dull white calcareous substance of which it was mainly built up.\r\nBut there were other objects of interest in the sand: bits of tangle,\r\ncrusted over with a fine net-work of gauze, and fragments of thin\r\nleaf-like membrane, consisting of a similar slender network known\r\npopularly as the _sea-mat_, occasionally turned up among the pebbles\r\nand shells. No one who met with these organisms for the first time\r\ncould fail to be struck with the extreme delicacy of finish, if one\r\nmay so speak, that characterizes them. And yet he might be puzzled to\r\nknow what to make of them. The leaf-like membrane, at a first glance,\r\nlooks not unlike some of the flat-leaved algæ, and such the observer\r\nmight readily take them to be. Such, too, they were long regarded by\r\nnaturalists; but a more careful examination of them showed that the\r\nso-called plants really belonged to the animal kingdom, and that the\r\nsupposed leaves were, in truth, the organic dwelling-places of minute\r\nzoophytes, of which many hundreds lay grouped together on every square\r\ninch. For many years these little creatures were called \"celliferous\r\ncorallines,\" and classed among the polypi, that great tribe which has\r\nits representatives in every ocean, from the coral reefs of the Pacific\r\nto the little bell-shaped _hydra_ amid the tangle of our own seas.\r\nBut the microscope--that lamp which lights us into the inner recesses\r\nof nature--revealed at last their true character. Fixed to one spot,\r\nliving in communities, and exceedingly minute, in short, with many of\r\nthe outward features of the true corallines, they were yet found to\r\npossess a structure so complex and highly organized, as to entitle them\r\nto rank among the higher tribes of the invertebrate animals, and they\r\nare now accordingly pretty generally subjoined to the mollusca, under\r\nthe name of _Bryozoa_.\r\n\r\nEach bryozoon consists externally of a single horny or calcareous cell,\r\nsometimes furnished with a valve-like lid that folds down when the\r\nanimal withdraws itself. When danger is past, and the creature begins\r\nagain to emerge, the upper parts, which were drawn in like the inverted\r\nfinger of a glove, are pushed out until a series of tentacles, covered\r\nwith minute hair-like bodies, called cilia, are expanded. The vibratile\r\nmotion of these cilia causes a constant current in the direction of\r\nthe mouth, which lies in the centre of the hollow whence the tentacles\r\nspring; animalcules are in this way brought in rapid succession within\r\nreach of the mouth, and form a never-failing source of nourishment.\r\nThe interior is greatly more complex than that of the _polypi_. The\r\nstomach is connected above with a cavity like the gizzard of a bird,\r\nfurnished with pointed sides, which serve to triturate the food before\r\nit passes into the stomach. There is also a distinct intestine. The\r\nmuscular action for the expansion and retraction of the animal is\r\nhighly developed, and the generative system is a greatly more complex\r\none than that of the polyps already referred to. In short, however\r\nclosely they might be thought to resemble the corals in outward form,\r\ntheir internal structure undoubtedly links them with a much higher type\r\nof organization, and justifies the naturalist in subjoining them as a\r\nsub-order to the mollusca.\r\n\r\nThe cells are grouped at short intervals along a horny or calcareous\r\nsubstance, that sometimes encrusts sea-weed, or spreads out as a flat\r\nleaf-like membrane, or rises into cup-shaped or dendritic forms. A\r\nseries of cells constituting a separate and independent colony, is\r\ntermed a polypidom. The cells are further connected together by an\r\nexternal jelly-like integument, in which they are sunk, and which\r\nserves to secrete the calcareous particles from the sea.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to know that creatures so minute and yet so complexly\r\norganized, existed abundantly in the seas of the Carboniferous period.\r\nNo less than fifty-four species are enumerated as having been obtained\r\nfrom the carboniferous strata of the British Islands, and scarcely a\r\nyear passes without one or two new species being added to the list.\r\nThe most frequent belong to the genus _Fenestella_, or little window,\r\na name indicative of the reticulated grouping of the branches like the\r\nwooden framework of a window. Each of these branches, or interstices,\r\nas they are called, was more or less straight, being connected with\r\nthat on either side by a row of transverse bars, just as the central\r\nmullion of an abbey window is connected with the flanking ones by means\r\nof cross-bars of stone. Not unfrequently some of the branches subdivide\r\ninto two, as we saw to be the case among the cup-corals.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 18.--_a_, Fenestella oculata (M'Coy), nat. size;\r\n_b_, magnified portion of the same.]\r\n\r\nFig. 18 illustrates the relative disposition of these branches. In _a_,\r\nthe natural size of the fossil is given; _b_ is a portion of the same\r\nmagnified, to show the form and arrangement of the ribs and cross-bars.\r\nEach rib is seen to have two sides separated by a rounded ridge. Along\r\neach side there runs a row of circular hollows or cells, every one\r\nof which once formed the abode of a distinct bryozoon. The back or\r\ninner surface of the branch, was ribbed and granulated irregularly,\r\nwithout any cells. The connecting bars or dissepiments have no cells,\r\nand served merely to bind the interstices together into one firm\r\norganically-united polypidom. Such fragments as that here figured\r\nare the most usual traces to be found of these animals among the\r\ncarboniferous rocks. But perfect specimens are sometimes met with which\r\nshow how delicate and graceful a structure the polypidom of some of the\r\nfenestellæ must have been. All these bars sprung from a common point\r\nas their basis, and rose up in the form of a cup. It was, in short, a\r\ncup of network, hung with waving tentacles and quivering cilia. I have\r\nseen some dissections of flowers in which all the softer tissue had\r\nbeen removed, so as to present only the harder veinings of the leaves\r\nwith their thousand ramifications bleached to a delicate whiteness.\r\nOut of these skeleton-leaves there were formed groups of lilies,\r\ncrocuses, geraniums, and roses, like patterns of the finest gauze. Some\r\nof the larger-stemmed leaves that had been artistically moulded into a\r\ntulip form, seemed not inaptly to represent the general contour of the\r\nskeleton of the old carboniferous fenestella.\r\n\r\nAn allied form is called the _Retepora_. It differed from the previous\r\norganism in having the ribs not straight, but irregularly anastomosing,\r\nthat is, running into and coalescing with each other, so as to form\r\na close network with oval interspaces, like a piece of very minute\r\nwire-fence. Each of these wavy libs was completely covered over on one\r\nside with oval pores or cells, which, as in the fenestella, formed the\r\nabode of the living animals. The differences in organization between\r\nthe animal of fenestella and that of retepora can, of course, only be\r\nmatter of speculation. The general structure in both must, however,\r\nhave been pretty much alike. The former genus is now no longer extant,\r\nbut the latter, which was ushered into the world during the era of the\r\nOld Red Sandstone, still lives in the deeper recesses of the ocean, and\r\nmanifests in its structure and habits the leading characteristics of\r\nbryozoan life.\r\n\r\nWhat rambler among old lime-quarries is not familiar with the\r\nstone-lily, so abundant an organism in most of the Palæozoic and\r\nmany of the Secondary limestones? In some beds of the carboniferous\r\nlimestone its abundance is almost incredible. I have seen a weathered\r\ncliff in which its remains stood out in bold relief, crowded together,\r\nto use an expression of Dr. Buckland's, \"as thickly as straws in a\r\ncorn-rick.\" The joints of this animal, known now as _entrochi_ or\r\nwheel-stones, forced themselves on the notice of men during even the\r\nmiddle ages, and an explanation was soon found for their existence.\r\nFrom their occurring largely about the coast at Holy Island, they were\r\nset down as the workmanship of Saint Cuthbert.\r\n\r\n          \"On a rock by Lindisfarne,\r\n    St. Cuthbert sits and toils to frame\r\n    The sea-born beads which bear his name.\"\r\n\r\nThe aged saint was represented as employing his nights in this highly\r\nintellectual task, sitting on a lone rock out in the sea, and using an\r\nadjacent one as his anvil.\r\n\r\n    \"Such tales had Whitby's fishers told,\r\n    And said they might his shape behold,\r\n      And hear his anvil sound,\r\n    A deaden'd clang,--a huge dim form\r\n    Seen but, and heard, when gathering storm\r\n      And night were closing round.\"\r\n\r\nBut these wheel-stones were not the only geological curiosities\r\nto which this simple mode of explanation was applied. In the same\r\nstoried neighbourhood there occur in considerable numbers the round\r\nwhorled shells of the genus _Ammonites_. These were gravely set down\r\nas petrified snakes wanting the head, and their petrifaction and\r\ndecapitation were alike reverently ascribed to the power of the sainted\r\nabbess of Whitby.\r\n\r\n                  \"They told\r\n    How of a thousand snakes each one\r\n    Was changed into a coil of stone\r\n    When holy Hilda prayed.\"\r\n\r\nThe stone-lily belonged to that large class of animals ranked together\r\nas _Echinodermata_, a name taken from one of the leading subdivisions\r\nof the group--the _Echini_ or sea-urchins. It seems to have been one\r\nof the earliest forms of life upon our planet, its disjointed stalks\r\noccurring largely in some of the oldest Silurian limestones. In the\r\nSecondary ages it began gradually to wane, until at the present day its\r\nnumerous genera appear to be represented by but the _comatula_ and the\r\n_pentacrinite_, two tiny forms that float their jointed arms in the\r\nprofounder depths of the sea.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 19.--_a_, Cyathocrinites planus. _b_, Encrinal\r\nstem, with uniform joints. _c_, Single joint, or wheelstone.]\r\n\r\nAs its name imports, the stone-lily or encrinite had a plant-like\r\nform. It consisted of a long stalk fixed by the lower end to the\r\nsea-bottom, and supporting above a lily-shaped cup, in which were\r\nplaced the mouth and stomach (Fig. 19 _a_). The stalk consisted of\r\ncircular plates (some of them not so thick as a sixpence), having\r\ntheir flat sides covered with a set of minute ribs radiating from the\r\ncentre, and so arranged that the prominent lines of one joint fitted\r\ninto corresponding depressed lines of the adhering ones. The centre\r\nof each joint was pierced by a small aperture, like the axle of a\r\nwheel, which, when the stem was entire, formed part of the long tube\r\nor canal that traversed the centre of the stem, and served to convey\r\naliment to the remotest part of the animal. Detached joints have thus\r\na wheel-like appearance (Fig 19 _c_), and hence their common name of\r\nwheel-stones. In many species they were not all of the same diameter,\r\nbut alternately larger and smaller, as if the stem had been made up of\r\na tall pile of sixpences and threepenny pieces in alternate succession.\r\nThis variation gives a remarkably elegant contour to the stalk. The\r\nflower-shaped cup consisted of a cavity formed of geometric calcareous\r\nplates, and fringed along its upper margin with thick calcareous\r\narms, five or ten in number, that subdivided into still more slender\r\nbranches, which were fringed along their inner side with minute _cirri_\r\nor feelers. All these subdivisions, however fine, were made up of\r\ncalcareous joints like the stalk, so that every stone-lily consisted\r\nof many thousand pieces, each perfect in its organization and delicate\r\nin its sculpturing. One species peculiar to the Liassic formation\r\n(_Extracrinus Briareus_) has been calculated to contain one hundred and\r\nfifty thousand joints!\r\n\r\nThe effect of this minute subdivision was to impart the most perfect\r\nflexibility to even the smallest pinnule. The flower could instantly\r\ncollapse, and thus the animals on which the encrinite preyed were\r\nseized and hurried to the central mouth. The lower part of the cup, or\r\n_pelvis_, as it is called, contained the stomach and other viscera, and\r\ncommunicated with the most distant part of the body by the central\r\nalimentary canal.\r\n\r\nBut while this continued the general type on which the encrinites\r\nwere constructed, it received many minor modifications. These were\r\neffected chiefly on the form and arrangement of the cup-shaped body\r\nand its appendages, and form now the basis of our classification\r\ninto genera and species. Thus, in the genus known as _Platycrinus_,\r\nthe lower part of the cup consists of two rows of large hexagonal or\r\npolygonal plates fitting closely into each other, while the upper part\r\nrises into a dome-like elevation formed of smaller polygonal plates,\r\nwhich have often a mammillated exterior. The arms sprang from the\r\nwidest part of the body where the large pieces of the lower cup were\r\nsucceeded by the small pieces of the upper. In an Irish species (_P.\r\ntriacontadactylus_), the arms subdivided into thirty branches, each\r\nfringed with minuter pinnules and folding round the central elevated\r\nspire, as the petals of a crocus close round its central pistil. In\r\nanother encrinite (_Poteriocrinites conicus_), the cup was shaped like\r\nan inverted cone, the point being affixed to the summit of the stalk,\r\nand the broad part throwing out from its edges the lateral arms. The\r\n_Woodocrinus macrodactylus_ had such gigantic arms as well-nigh to\r\nconceal the position of the cup, which relatively was very small in\r\nsize. They sprang from near the base of the cup, five in number, but\r\nsoon subdivided each into two, the ten arms thus produced being closely\r\nfringed with the usual jointed calcareous pinnules.\r\n\r\nThe size and arrangement of the joints of the stalk also differed in\r\ndifferent genera. The Woodocrinus and many others had them alternately\r\nbroad and narrow, like a string of buttons of unequal sizes; others had\r\nall the joints of the same relative diameter (Fig. 19 _b_), so that the\r\nstalk tapered by a uniform line from base to point. I may add, that\r\non some specimens of both these kinds of stems, we can notice small,\r\nsolitary _areolæ_, or scars, which may mark the points of attachment\r\nof cirri, or little tentacles, like those on the stem of the existing\r\nPentacrinite. But though each of these varieties of stem is peculiar to\r\na certain number of genera, there is often so little distinction among\r\nthe detached fragments, that it becomes difficult, indeed impossible,\r\nto assign each to its appropriate individual. We may say, that certain\r\nencrinal stalks could not have belonged to a poteriocrinus, and others\r\ncould never have fitted on to the cup of an actinocrinus; but we cannot\r\noften say positively to what species they actually would have fitted.\r\nThere can, however, be no doubt about their being encrinites, and so\r\nwe have in them a safe and evident test for the origin of the rock in\r\nwhich their remains occur. But to this I shall afterwards revert.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, I would have the reader to fix the stone-lily in\r\nhis memory as peculiarly and emphatically a marine animal, dwelling\r\nprobably in the deeper and stiller recesses of the ocean, like the\r\nPentacrinite of existing times. Let him try to remember it, not in the\r\nbroken and sorely mutilated state in which we find it among the blocks\r\nof our lime-quarries, but as it must have lived at the bottom of the\r\ncarboniferous seas. The oozy floor of these old waters lay thickly\r\ncovered with many a graceful production of the deep, submarine gardens\r\nof\r\n\r\n    \"Violet, asphodel, ivy, and vine-leaves, roses and lilies,\r\n    Coral and sea-fan, and tangle, the blooms and the palms of the ocean.\"\r\n\r\nAmid this rich assemblage of animated forms, the stone-lilies must have\r\noccupied a conspicuous place. Grouped in thick-set though diminutive\r\nforests, these little creatures raised their waving stems, and spread\r\nout their tremulous arms, like beds of tulips swaying in the evening\r\nair. Their flower like cups, so delicately fringed, must have presented\r\na scene of ceaseless activity as they opened and closed, coiling up\r\nwhile the animal seized its prey, or on the approach of danger, and\r\nrelaxing again when the food had been secured, or when the symptoms\r\nof a coming enemy had passed away. Only from this animated action\r\nwould one have been apt to conjecture these organisms to be other\r\nthan vegetable. They lived, too, not in detached patches, like the\r\ntulip-beds of the florist, but, to judge from the abundance of their\r\nremains, must have covered acre after acre, and square mile 'after\r\nsquare mile, with a dense growth of living, quivering flowers. As one\r\nindividual died out, another took its place, the decaying steins and\r\nflowers meanwhile falling to pieces among the limy sediment that lay\r\nthickly athwart the sea-bottom, and contributing, by their decay and\r\nentombment, to build up those enormous masses of rock, known as the\r\nmountain-limestone, which stretch through Yorkshire and the central\r\ncounties into Wales.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the stone-lilies, the carboniferous rocks contain the\r\nremains of several other kinds of _Echinodermata_. Some of them find\r\ntheir nearest modern analogues among the sea-urchins so common on\r\nour shores; but I pass on to notice another very interesting class\r\nof fossils known by the name of _Crustacea_, and still abundantly\r\nrepresented, the crab and lobster being familiar examples.\r\n\r\nThe Crustacea, so called from the hard crust or shell which envelops\r\nthem, form, with all their orders and genera, a very numerous family.\r\nThey are of interest to us as containing among their number some of\r\nthe oldest forms of life. Away down in the lower Silurian rocks, among\r\nthe most ancient fossiliferous strata, we find the crustacean with\r\nits armour of plates and its prominent sessile eyes set round with\r\nlenses, still visible on the stone. Thus, on the first page of the\r\nstony records of our planet's history are these primeval organisms\r\nengraved. In some localities, where oxide of iron is largely present,\r\nthey are coated with a bright yellow efflorescence, and stand out\r\nfrom the dull grey stone like figures embossed in gold.[31] On all\r\nthe subsequent leaves of this ancient chronicle, we can detect the\r\nremains of crustacean life, and many tribes still swarm in our seas\r\nand lakes. It is interesting, however, as marking the onward progress\r\nof creation, to notice that, though this great family has continued\r\nto live during all the successive geological ages, its members have\r\never been changing, the older types waning and dying out, while newer\r\ngenera rose to supply for a time their place, and then passed away\r\nbefore the advance of other and yet later forms. The trilobites that\r\nmeet us on the very verge of creation, swarmed by millions in the seas\r\nof the Silurian ages, diminished gradually during the era of the Old\r\nRed Sandstone, and seem to have died out altogether in the times of\r\nthe Coal. In no ocean of the present day is a trace of any of their\r\nmany genera to be seen. The _decapods_, of which our common crab is a\r\ntypical form, began to be after the trilobites had died out. In all the\r\nsubsequent eras they gradually increased in numbers, and at the present\r\nday they form the most abundant order of crustacean life. The history\r\nof these two divisions, to adopt Agassiz's mode of representation, may\r\nbe illustrated by two long tapering bands like two attenuated pyramids.\r\nThe one has its broad base resting upon the existing now, and thinning\r\naway into the past, till at last it comes to a point. At a little\r\ninterval the apex of the other begins, and gradually swells outward as\r\nit recedes, till the wide base terminates at the first beginnings of\r\nlife.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 31: Such is the aspect of the organisms in some of the\r\nSilurian sandstones near Girvan. I have seen the same bright tint\r\non a set of fossils from the Llandeilo flags of Wales, and from the\r\nslates of Desertcreat, Ireland, and have disinterred similarly gilded\r\nshells from the vertical greywackè slates of the Pentland Hills and\r\nPeeblesshire. Nothing can be more beautiful than the aspect of these\r\nfossils when first laid open, but the bright gleam eventually passes\r\naway on exposure.]\r\n\r\nBut there are also some orders that would be best illustrated by a\r\nlong line of nearly uniform breadth, extending from the first geologic\r\nperiods to the present day. In other words, they seem to have retained\r\nduring all time pretty much the same amount of development. I shall\r\nconfine my notice of the carboniferous Crustacea to the description of\r\na single genus belonging to a family that seems to have begun during\r\nthe period of the Lower Silurian, and still flourishes abundantly in\r\nexisting waters.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 20.\r\n\r\n  1. Carboniferous cypris, nat. size, and magnified.\r\n  2. Recent cypris, highly magnified.\r\n  3. Carboniferous king-crab (_Limulus trilobitoides_).\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe genus to which I refer is a well-known fossil in some parts of\r\nthe Coal-measure series, and has been named _Cypris_. The shells of\r\n_cyprides_ are very minute, considerably less than the heads of small\r\npins (Fig. 20-1). They can be seen quite well, however, without the\r\nuse of a magnifying power. In shape they resemble beans, and when seen\r\nscattered over a slab of shale, look much liker seeds than the relics\r\nof animal life. Yet, under this simple exterior, they concealed a\r\nsomewhat complex organization. The little bean-shaped shells, which\r\nare all that now remains to us of their structure, formed the crust\r\nor outer shell in which their viscera were contained, and answered to\r\nthe massive carapace and segments of the crab. They consisted of two\r\nvalve-like cases fitting to each other, so as to resemble the united\r\nvalves of a bivalve shell. From the upper end there were protruded\r\nthrough the opening between the valves a pair of slim jointed antennæ,\r\neach furnished at its point with a bundle of minute hair-like cilia\r\n(Fig. 20-2). These, when set in rapid motion, served to impel the\r\ncreature through the water. The legs, four in number, were encrusted\r\nwith the same hard membrane, and had the same jointed structure as\r\nthose of our common shrimps and crabs. The foremost pair were pointed\r\nlike the antennæ with fine hairs, the incessant action of which\r\nassisted the animal in swimming. Of the little, confluent, sessile\r\neyes, the delicate branchia or gills, and all the complex internal\r\nstructure of the nervous, circulating, and other systems, no trace\r\nhas survived on the stone; but enough of the general external form is\r\nleft to show us the true affinities of these organisms in the animated\r\nworld of the present time. By studying the forms and habits of the\r\ncyprides that swarm in some of our ponds and marshes, a just conception\r\nis obtained of the structure and habitat of the animals that once\r\noccupied the minute bean-shaped shells, which lie by millions among the\r\nshales of the Carboniferous system. From such a comparison we infer,\r\nthat just as the cyprides of to-day are fresh-water animals abounding\r\namong the green slime of stagnant pools, so, in past ages, they must\r\nhave preserved with the same organization the same habits. And thus\r\nwe arrive at the important conclusion that the strata in which the\r\nremains of cyprides abound must have been deposited in lakes or rivers.\r\nThis gives us a key by which to interpret some of the changes of a\r\ngeological system, and the ancient physical revolutions of large tracts\r\nof country.\r\n\r\nThe shales of the coal-measures sometimes contain the cypris cases in\r\nsuch abundance as to derive therefrom a sort of fissile structure.\r\nIt should be borne in mind, however, that each animal may during its\r\nlifetime have possessed in succession several of these cases. Among the\r\nshell-bearing molluscous animals, the little shell which contains the\r\ncreature in its youngest stages remains ever after as an integral part\r\nof the outer calcareous case. As the inhabitant grows, it continues\r\nto add band after band to the outer edge of the shell, each of which,\r\nwhilst preserving the general symmetry and proportions of the whole\r\nstructure, increases its dimensions in every way. Among the univalves,\r\nsuch, for example, as the turritella, so common on our shores, the\r\nlayers of growth succeed each other like the steps of one of those\r\nlong spiral stairs that our feudal forefathers loved to build from\r\nthe court-yard to the watch-tower of their castles. Each new layer\r\nexceeding in bulk its predecessors, adds a new step to the ascending\r\npile, and thus the ever-widening mouth winds spirally upwards around\r\nthe central pillar. The bivalves exemplify the same principle. The\r\nsuccessive additions are made in a crescent form to the outer edges,\r\nand form those prominent concentric ridges so conspicuous on many of\r\nour commoner shells, such, for instance, as some of those in the genera\r\n_Astarte_ and _Venus_.\r\n\r\nBut the architecture of the Crustacea (and, of course, that of the\r\ncyprides) is conducted on a very different principle. Their houses\r\nadmit of no additions or enlargements, and so, when the animals find\r\nthemselves getting somewhat straitened, they retire to a sheltered\r\nspot, and there, separating the walls that hem them in, crawl out like\r\nsoft lumps of dough. The outer membrane of the moulted animal quickly\r\nacquires strength and hardness, and in a day or two the renovated\r\ncreature is as healthy and vigorous as ever. In this process it is\r\nnot merely an external shell, like that of a mollusc, which is thrown\r\noff, but a veritable skin, so that when the old shell is abandoned\r\nit frequently could not be detected on a first glance to be empty,\r\nthe outer crust of every leg and joint, and sometimes even of thin\r\nbristles, remaining just as in the living animal.\r\n\r\nIt is not unlikely that this process of moulting takes place annually\r\nin most of the Crustacea, so that if we suppose a fossil member of the\r\ngroup to have lived six years, it would have left six crusts to be\r\nentombed in any deposits that might be forming at the time. Of course\r\nthere would be many chances against all the six being preserved, but\r\nthe possibility of at least several of them becoming fossilized should\r\nbe borne in mind when we speculate on the abundance of such organisms\r\nin any geological formation.\r\n\r\nI might refer to another very interesting group of crustacean animals\r\nknown as the _Limuli_, or king-crabs, of which there were at least\r\nthree representatives during the times of the English Carboniferous\r\nsystem (Fig. 20-3). They are remarkable chiefly for their large\r\ncrescent-shaped shield, their long sword-like tail, and their double\r\npair of eyes, of which the outer ones are large, sessile, and compound,\r\nlike those of the trilobites, while the middle pair are small, simple,\r\nand set close together on the forehead, like those of the single-eyed\r\nCyclops in the old mythology. Altogether, with their shields, swords,\r\nwatchful waking eyes, strong massive armour, and great size (for some\r\nof them measure two feet in length), they form a most warlike genus.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\n  Carboniferous fauna continued--George Herbert's ode on\r\n       \"Man\"--His idea of creation--What nature teaches on\r\n       this subject--Molluscous animals--Range of species in\r\n       time proportionate to their distribution in space--Two\r\n       principles of renovation and decay exhibited alike in the\r\n       physical world and the world of life--Their effects--The\r\n       mollusca--Abundantly represented in the carboniferous\r\n       rocks--Pteropods--Brachiopods--Productus--Its alliance with\r\n       Spirifer--Spirifer--Terebratula--Lamellibranchs--Gastropods--\r\n       Land-snail of Nova Scotia--Cephalopods--Structure of orthoceras--\r\n       Habits of living nautilus.\r\n\r\nHoly George Herbert, in one of the most remarkable odes of the\r\nseventeenth century, sang quaintly, yet nobly, of the dignity of man.\r\nHe looked into the design and nature of the human heart, and saw there\r\na palace that had been built for the abode of the Eternal. Deserted\r\nthough it might be, broken down and in ruins, yet there still lingered\r\na trace of its ancient glory, and the whole material world still\r\ntestified to its inherent greatness. He looked abroad on the face of\r\nnature, and saw, in all its objects and all its movements, a continued\r\nministration to man.\r\n\r\n            \"For us the windes do blow;\r\n    The earth doth rest, heav'n move, and fountains flow.\r\n        Nothing we see, but means our good,\r\n        As our delight, or as our treasure;\r\n    The whole is, either our cupboard of food,\r\n            Or cabinet of pleasure.\r\n\r\n            \"The starres have us to bed;\r\n    Night draws the curtain, which the sunne withdraws;\r\n        Musick and light attend our head.\r\n        All things unto our flesh are kinde\r\n    In their descent and being; to our minde\r\n            In their ascent and cause.\"\r\n\r\nThe idea is a very natural one, and is consequently as old as man\r\nhimself. Human vanity is soothed by the reflection that all this varied\r\nworld, with its countless beauties, has been designed and arrayed\r\nsolely for the use of man. And yet, if we but think of it, such a view\r\nof creation, however natural and pleasing, is at the best but a narrow\r\nand selfish one. It assuredly finds no response in nature, and grows\r\nmore and more out of fashion the further our investigations proceed.\r\nNature teaches us that long ere man appeared upon the earth there were\r\nsuccessive generations of living things just as now; that the sun\r\nshone, and the waves rolled, and the wind blew, as they do to-day; and\r\nthat, on as lovely a planet as that whereon we dwell, there lay forests\r\nand prairies nursing in abundance animals of long-extinct forms; lakes\r\nand rivers, haunted by creatures that find no representatives now;\r\nand seas teeming with life, from the minute infusory up to the most\r\nunwieldy icthyosaur, or the most gigantic cetacean. And all this, too,\r\nere a reasoning, intelligent being had been numbered among terrestrial\r\ncreatures, and when, perhaps, each successive creation was witnessed\r\nby none save those \"morning stars who sang together, and those sons\r\nof God who shouted for joy.\" The delight and comfort of the human\r\nrace formed, doubtless, one of the many reasons why this globe was so\r\nbountifully garnished.[32] But the workmanship of a Being infinitely\r\nwise, and good, and powerful, could hardly have been other than\r\ncomplex and beautiful. That symmetry and grace which we see running\r\nas a silver thread through every part of creation, forms one of the\r\ncharacteristics of the Almighty's mode of working. From the Fountain\r\nof all Beauty nothing unseemly or deformed can proceed. And so we\r\nfind, away back among the ages of the past, that, though the material\r\nworld might be less complete, it was not less beautiful than now. Nay,\r\nthose bygone millenniums stood higher in one respect, for the eye of\r\nGod rested upon their unsullied glory, and he pronounced them very\r\ngood; but these last ages of creation are dimmed and darkened, and\r\nthat Eye now watches a world trodden down by the powers of evil. There\r\nis profound truth in the sublime allegory of Milton that represents\r\nSin girt round with clamorous hell-hounds, and the two grisly forms\r\nsitting at the farthest verge of purity and light, to keep the gates of\r\ndarkness and chaos. With the introduction of moral evil into our planet\r\ncame the elements of deformity and confusion. The geologist can go back\r\nto a time ere yet the harmony of nature had been broken. The Christian\r\nlooks forward to a day when that harmony shall be again restored, and\r\nwhen guilt with all its hideous train shall be for ever chased away\r\nfrom the abodes of the redeemed.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 32: In connexion with this subject I have been often struck\r\nwith a passage in St. Paul's Epistle to the Colossians, i. 10, \"All\r\nthings were created by him [Christ] and for [εις--with a view to,\r\non account of] him.\" It is probable that these words, in their full\r\nmeaning, cannot be understood by us. Yet they seem to point to Christ\r\nas at once the Creator, and himself the acme and design of creation;\r\nand perhaps they may contain what hereafter shall prove the key to\r\nthe mystery of creation. On this impressive and difficult subject the\r\nreader should refer to the closing chapter of Hugh Miller's _Footprints\r\nof the Creator_. See also M'Cosh on _Typical Forms_, 2d edit. p. 531.]\r\n\r\nSuch thoughts as these sometimes arise in the mind of one who labours\r\nmuch among organic remains. By no class of fossils are they more\r\nvividly suggested than by those which we come next to examine--the\r\nvarious tribes of molluscous animals. This results from the high\r\nantiquity of these organisms, and the similarity of type which they\r\nhave manifested in all ages. In the very earliest geological periods\r\nthey exhibited the same symmetry of external form as now, the same\r\nbeauty of structure, and apparently the same delicacy of colour. Nay,\r\nso closely did they resemble their existing congeners that we are\r\nseldom at a loss as to their affinities, and can refer them to their\r\nplaces in the scale of creation, and sometimes even to genera still\r\nliving.[33]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 33: It must be admitted, however, that not a few of the\r\nidentifications already made are somewhat suspicious The natural\r\ntendency is to perceive resemblances--a tendency which even the most\r\nrigid science sometimes fails to control.]\r\n\r\nThe geological ages saw many strange types of creation. One era, in\r\nespecial, furnished reptiles which united in their structure the snout\r\nof the porpoise, the head of the lizard, the teeth of the crocodile,\r\nthe paddles of the whale, and the backbone of the fish. Some displayed\r\nthe long pliant neck of the swan, and others careered through the\r\nair on wings like those of the bat. But the molluscous tribes have\r\nnever exhibited such aberrant forms. The existing classes and orders\r\nof the naturalist are still the same as those which nourished during\r\nthe successive geological periods. Hence their value as evidence of\r\nphysical changes in the ancient world. Hence, too, the conviction,\r\nforced upon the mind of the observer, that the conditions for the\r\nsupport of life never deviated much from those now in operation; that\r\nin place of all the varied beauty of the world having arisen for the\r\nuse of man, it existed millions of years ere the breath of life had\r\nbeen breathed into his nostrils; that in fine, man is but a new-comer,\r\na creation of yesterday.\r\n\r\nThere is another point suggested by the occurrence of mollusca in the\r\nCarboniferous system, to which it may be well to refer, namely, the\r\ncurious, and as yet not wholly understood fact, that the range of\r\nanimals in time is in some way proportionate to their range in space.\r\nIn other words, it often happens (so often, indeed, as apparently to\r\nindicate a law) that the more widely diffused a genus is found to be\r\nat the present day, the farther back can we trace its remains into the\r\ngeological ages. This fact probably depends upon causes, many of which\r\nare still unknown to us; but the following remarks may help the reader\r\nto a notion of the general bearings of the subject.[34]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 34: The law is more especially exemplified by the mollusca,\r\nbut it may eventually be found to characterize other classes. We,\r\nperhaps, see traces of it in the present distribution of the two most\r\nancient orders of icthyic life--the placoids and ganoids.]\r\n\r\nIn the profounder recesses of the ocean, the temperature remains more\r\nor less uniform all over the globe.[35] In these undisturbed regions\r\nthere occur, along with corals and other humble animals, many kinds of\r\nmollusca, such as terebratulæ, craniæ, scissurellæ, &c. These are very\r\ngenerally found not to be confined to one province or limited district,\r\nbut to flourish in every sea from Hudson's Bay to Hindustan. One of\r\nthe causes of this wide distribution is the uniformity of temperature\r\nthat characterizes the depths in which they live. They can migrate\r\nfrom one ocean to another, from the torrid zone to the polar circle,\r\nwithout experiencing any destructive change in the thermal conditions\r\nof their element. And provided only they meet with no barrier in the\r\nform of a lofty submarine mountain chain or profound abyss, and can\r\nsecure the requisite food in their journey, we know no reason why some\r\nof these shells may not thus extend themselves over wide areas. Of the\r\ntwo species of _rhynconella_ now living, one inhabits the depths of\r\nthe icy sea, the other enjoys the warmer waters that lave New Zealand.\r\nThe species, in this case, seem (for the fact cannot yet be accepted\r\nas fully proved) to occupy a more limited area, while the genus has a\r\nlarger range.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 35: The stratum of constant temperature runs in a wave-like\r\nform from pole to pole. In the arctic and antarctic oceans it is found\r\nat a depth of 4500 feet, whence it slopes upwards so as to reach the\r\nsurf ice at the temperate zone on both sides of the equator. It then\r\ngradually sinks down in the warmer regions, till at the equator it is\r\n7200 feet below the sea-level. There are thus one tropical and two\r\npolar basins separated by two wave-like circles, or, as a geologist\r\nwould say, three synclinal troughs separated by two anticlinal ridges.]\r\n\r\nNow, a genus widely diffused, and capable of enduring great differences\r\nin the temperature and other conditions of the ocean, would probably\r\nsuffer least from any great physical changes. If all the sea at one\r\nlocality were converted into land, the genus would be driven into other\r\ndistricts, and thrive as abundantly as ever; or, even supposing that it\r\nshould become locally extinct, it would still be abundantly represented\r\nin other oceans of the globe. In the course of many ages, after many\r\nsuch slow revolutions in the configuration of land and sea, the genus\r\nmight perhaps become greatly reduced in numbers, until at length some\r\nfinal elevation of the sea-bed, or other change, might cause its total\r\nextinction. In the _rhynconella_, we perhaps see one of these genera in\r\nits last stage. Any great change in northern latitudes would probably\r\ndestroy the arctic species, and a similar change around New Zealand\r\nmight gradually extinguish the southern one.\r\n\r\nLooking, then, from this point of view into the past history of life\r\nupon our planet, we see that such extinctions have often taken place.\r\nAt first, many of these widely-diffused genera were created. They\r\nwere represented by a large number of species as well as individuals,\r\nand ranged over all the oceans of the globe; but in tracing out their\r\nhistory, we mark one species after another passing away. Some of them\r\nlived for but a comparatively short period; others came in with the\r\nbeginning and saw out the end of an entire geological system; but of\r\nall these early species there is not now a single one extant, though\r\nsome of the genera still inhabit our seas. It is plain, therefore,\r\nthat but for the operation of another principle, all the genera, too,\r\nwould ere this have become extinct, for the whole can contain no more\r\nthan the sum of its parts; and if these parts are destroyed the whole\r\nmust perish simultaneously. As the species of certain genera died out,\r\nhowever, their places were from time to time filled up with new ones,\r\nyet the rate of increase became ever less and less than the rate of\r\ndecrease, so that the numbers of such genera grew fewer with every\r\nsuccessive period, and have reached their minimum in existing seas.\r\nThere are instances, however, in which this ratio was reversed, the\r\nlist of added species continually outnumbering that of the extinct,\r\ntill the genus reached its maximum, when it either continued at that\r\nstage till the present day, or began slowly to decline.\r\n\r\nIn the physical world around us, we behold a perpetual strife between\r\nthe two great principles of renovation and decay. Hills are insensibly\r\ncrumbling into valleys; valleys are gradually cut down, and their\r\ndebris transported to the sea. Our shores bear witness to the slow\r\nbut ever onward march of the ocean, whether as shattered cliff's worn\r\nby the incessant lashing of the surge, or as sand-banks and submerged\r\nforests that represent the wolds and holms of our forefathers. We mark,\r\ntoo, how the sediment thus borne into the main is sowing\r\n\r\n    \"The dust of continents to be;\"\r\n\r\nwhile the slow elevation of large tracts of country, or the sudden\r\nupheaval of others, shows us by how powerful an agency the balance of\r\nland and sea is preserved, and how sometimes the paroxysm of an hour\r\nmay effect a mightier change than the wasting and decay of a thousand\r\nyears. We choose to call these two principles antagonistic, because in\r\ntheir effects they are entirely opposite; yet there is no discordance,\r\nno caprice in their operation. Each works out its end, and the result\r\nis the harmony and stability of the face of nature.\r\n\r\nIn the world of life, too, there seems to have been a double principle\r\nof decline and renewal. The natural tendency of species and genera,\r\nlike that of individuals, has been towards extinction. Why it should be\r\nso we know not, further than that they are for the most part influenced\r\nby every change in physical geography. But they probably obey a still\r\nhigher law which governs their duration, as the laws of vitality govern\r\nthe life of an individual If we are but slightly acquainted with the\r\nagency by which the degradation of land is counter-balanced, we are\r\nstill more ignorant of the laws that preserve the balance of life.\r\nCreation is a mystery, and such it must for ever remain. So, too, are\r\nthe principles on which it has been conducted. We can but mark their\r\nresults. We see new species appear from time to time in the upward\r\nseries of the geological formations, but they tell not whence they\r\ncame. Of two genera created together at the beginning, one ere long\r\ndied out, but the other still lives; yet here there is assuredly\r\nnought like discordance or caprice. Nay, these two principles--death\r\nand creation--have been in active operation all through the ages, and\r\nthe result is that varied and exquisitely beautiful world wherein we\r\ndwell.\r\n\r\nThe Mollusca are so named from the soft nature of their bodies, and are\r\nfamiliar to us as exemplified in the garden-snail and the shells of the\r\nsea-shore. The general type upon which they are constructed is that of\r\nan external muscular bag, either entire or divided into two, called\r\nthe mantle, in which the viscera are contained. In most of the orders,\r\nthey have likewise an outer hard calcareous shell, consisting of one or\r\nmore parts. It is of course this shell alone that can be detected in\r\nthe rocks, but by attending to the relations between the living animals\r\nand their shells, we ascertain the nature and affinities of the fossil\r\nspecies.\r\n\r\nFew who ramble by the sea-shore, gathering limpets, whelks, and\r\ncockles, are aware how complex an anatomy is concealed within one\r\nof those brown discoloured shells. There are elaborate nervous and\r\nmuscular systems--sometimes several hearts with accompanying arteries\r\nand veins--often dozens of rudimentary eyes--capsules which perform\r\nthe function of ears--jaws, teeth, a strongly armed tongue--gullet,\r\ngizzard, stomach, liver, intestine, and complete breathing apparatus.\r\nThe structure and grouping of these parts vary in the different genera\r\nand orders, and upon such variations is founded the classification of\r\nthe naturalist. Thus, the mollusca of the highest class are called\r\nthe _Cephalopoda_, or _head-footed_, because their feet, or rather\r\narms, are slung in a belt round the head. They contain, among their\r\nnumber, the cuttle-fish, with its curious internal bone that shadows\r\nforth, as it were, the coming of the vertebrate type; and the nautilus,\r\nwith its many-decked vessel of pearl. The second class is termed the\r\n_Gastropoda_, or _belly-footed_, as the genera embraced under it\r\ncreep on the under side of the body, which is expanded into a broad\r\nretractile foot. The common snail and whelk are familiar examples. The\r\nthird class is formed by the _Pteropoda_, or _wing-footed_--delicate\r\nanimals, found only in the open sea, and remarkable for a pair\r\nof wing-like expansions or fins on the sides of the mouth. The\r\n_Lamellibranchiata_ form the fourth class, and receive their name\r\nfrom the laminated form of their branchia, or gills. They contain the\r\ntwo-valved shells, such as the oyster and scallop, and are one of the\r\nmost abundant groups of animals on our coasts. The fifth class consists\r\nof the _Brachiopoda_, or _arm-footed_ molluscs a name given to them\r\nfrom their long spiral arms, once thought to be the instruments of\r\nmotion, but now ascertained only to assist in bringing the food to the\r\nmouth. The sixth, and humblest class, has received the designation of\r\n_Tunicata_, from the thick bladder-like tunic, or sac, which supplies\r\nthe place of an outer shell.\r\n\r\nThe geologist finds the remains of all these classes in the different\r\nrock-formations of the crust of the earth. They flourished so\r\nabundantly in the earliest seas, that the first geological period\r\nhas sometimes been called the Age of Molluscs; and, during all the\r\nsubsequent eras, they held a prominent place among the inhabitants of\r\nthe deep. Let us look for a little at their development in the times of\r\nthe Carboniferous system.\r\n\r\nAs the Carboniferous group of rocks exhibits the remains of ocean-bed,\r\nlake-bottom, and land-surface, so we find in it shells of marine,\r\nfresh-water and (though rarely) terrestrial mollusca. The marine\r\ngenera greatly predominate, just as the shells of the sea at the\r\npresent day vastly outnumber those either of lakes or of the land. In\r\nEngland they occur chiefly in the lower part of the formation, giving a\r\ncharacteristic stamp to the deep series of beds known as the mountain\r\nlimestone. There they are associated with the corals and stone-lilies\r\nalready described--all productions of the sea. In Northumberland,\r\nhowever, and generally throughout Scotland, they occupy a somewhat\r\ndifferent position. The great mountain limestone of central England\r\ngets split up into subdivisions as it proceeds northward, and beds of\r\ncoal, full of land plants, become mingled with the ordinary marine\r\nstrata. Sometimes we may find a group of brachiopods scattered over the\r\nmacerated stem of a stigmaria; and the writer has himself collected a\r\nsigillaria in a limestone crowded with stone-lilies and _producti_.\r\nBut this intermingling is still further carried on in the upper part\r\nof the series. The coal-beds, with their underclays and stigmaria\r\nrootlets, evidently representing ancient vegetation with the soils\r\non which it grew, are succeeded by beds of limestone, full of marine\r\nmollusca; and these, again, are erelong replaced by sandstones,\r\nshales, and ironstones, charged with land-plants and fresh-water\r\nshells. To this curious blending of very different organic remains, I\r\nshall have occasion to refer more at large in a subsequent chapter. I\r\nmention it now as a sort of apology for the dryness of details which\r\nit is necessary to give, in order to complete our picture of the\r\ncarboniferous fauna, and to understand the principles upon which the\r\nancient history of the earth is deciphered.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 21.]\r\n\r\nOf the _Pteropoda_, we have, as yet, but one carboniferous genus,\r\nthe _conularia_ (Fig. 21). It was a slim delicate shell, in shape an\r\noblong cone, having four sides, finely striated with a sort of zig-zag\r\nmoulding like that of the Norman arch. Each of the four angles was\r\ntraversed along its whole extent by a narrow gutter-like depression,\r\nand this style of fluting, combined with the markings on the sides,\r\nimparted no little elegance to the shell. The conularia is not a\r\ncommon fossil. It has been found among the coal-bearing strata of\r\nCoalbrook-Dale, and was noticed long ago by Dr. Ure in his _History of\r\nRutherglen_.\r\n\r\nThe _Brachiopoda_ are bivalve molluscs, but unlike most other molluscs\r\nthey are rooted to one spot, and destitute of any power of locomotion.\r\nTheir shells are unequal, the dorsal, or upper valve, being smaller\r\nand usually more bulged out than the under or ventral valve, which\r\nin most species is prolonged at its narrow end into a kind of beak.\r\nIn the terebratula this beak has a little circular hole, from which\r\nthere emerges a short peduncle or stalk, that fixes itself firmly to a\r\nrock or other substance at the sea-bottom, and serves the purpose of\r\nan anchor and cable to keep the little vessel safely moored. When the\r\nshells are detached, these perforated ventral valves have so exactly\r\nthe form of the old Roman lamps, \"that they were called _Lampades_,\r\nor lamp-shells, by the old naturalists.\"[36] Other species, as the\r\n_lingulæ_, have no beak, and the long peduncle passes out between the\r\nvalves, which are of nearly equal size, and have been compared to the\r\nshape of a duck's bill. In yet another genus, the _crania_, there is\r\nno peduncle, but the animal adheres by its lower valve, much like\r\nthe oyster, and may often be seen clustered in groups on decayed sea\r\nurchins or other organisms, particularly in the chalk formation.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 36: See the excellent _Manual of Mollusca_, by Woodward, p.\r\n209.]\r\n\r\nThe internal structure of these animals is singularly beautiful. The\r\ninner surface of each valve is lined with a soft membranous substance,\r\ncalled the pallial lobe, the margin of which is set round with stiff\r\nhair-like bristles, that prevent the ingress of any foreign body likely\r\nto interfere with the play of the delicate filaments of the arms. These\r\ntwo soft lobes are furnished with veins, and supply the place of a\r\nbreathing apparatus. The body of the animal occupies not quite a third\r\npart of the interior of its valves, and is situated at the narrow end.\r\nThere are thus two distinct regions within the shell, separated from\r\neach other by a strong membrane, through the centre of which is the\r\nopening of the mouth. The smaller cavity next the hinge contains the\r\nviscera, and the outer larger one, the folded and ciliated arms. These\r\narms form one of the most characteristic features of the brachiopods.\r\nThey are two in number, and proceeding from the margin of the mouth,\r\nadvance into the outer empty chamber of the shell, and return upon\r\nthemselves in spiral curves and folds. They are fringed with slim,\r\nflat, narrow filaments, set along the arm like teeth along the back of\r\na fine comb. Though called arms, these long ciliated appendages are\r\nrather enormously protruded lips. The vibratory action of the fringes\r\ncauses currents to set inwards towards the mouth, which is placed at\r\nthe inner end or base of the arms. To support these long convoluted\r\narms, many of the genera are furnished with slender hoops of hard\r\ncalcareous matter, which are hung from the dorsal valve, and are still\r\nfound within the shells of some of the most ancient fossil brachiopods.\r\n\r\nThe little visceral cavity contains the complex groups of muscles for\r\nopening and closing the valves, a simple stomach, a large granular\r\nliver, a short intestine, two hearts, and the centre of the nervous\r\nsystem. Without going into the details of these various structures,\r\nthe reader will see that the brachiopoda are really a highly organized\r\ntribe; and I am thus particular in the enumeration, partly that he may\r\nthe better understand the mechanism of the carboniferous shells of\r\nthat type, and partly that he may mark how the oldest forms of life,\r\nthose that meet us on the very threshold of animated existence, were\r\nnot low in organization, but possessed an anatomy as complex as it was\r\nbeautiful.\r\n\r\nWho that has ever wielded an enthusiastic hammer among the richly\r\nfossiliferous beds of the mountain limestone, does not remember with\r\ndelight the hosts of delicately fluted shells that the labour of an\r\nhour could pile up before him? There was the striated productus,\r\nwith its slim spines scattered over the stone. There, too, lay the\r\nspirifer with its broader plications, its toothed margin, and its\r\ndeeply indented valve. Less common, and so more highly prized, was the\r\nslimly-ribbed rhynconella, with its sharp, prominent beak, or perhaps\r\nthe smooth, thin terebratula, with its colour-bands not yet effaced.\r\nThese were pleasant hours, and their memory must dwell gratefully\r\namong the recollections of one whose avocations immure him throughout\r\nwell-nigh the livelong year amid the din and dust of town--the _fumum\r\net opes strepitumque Romæ_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 22.--Productus giganteus.]\r\n\r\nIn the _productus_ the dorsal valve is sometimes quite flat, while\r\nthe ventral is prominently arched, and the shell resembles a little\r\ncup with a flat plate of the same diameter placed over it. Usually,\r\nhowever, both the valves are concavo-convex, or arched in the same\r\ndirection like two saucers placed within each other. The exterior\r\nsurface of each valve is differently ornamented in the various species.\r\nA very common style of sculpturing is by a set of fine hair-like\r\nlongitudinal ribs, diverging more or less regularly from the hinge line\r\nto the outer margin. In some species these ribs are wider, and are\r\nfurnished with little prominent scars. In others (as _P. punctatus_)\r\na set of semicircular ridges runs round the shell, narrowing as they\r\nconverge from the outer lips to the centre of the hinge line, and\r\nbearing each an irregular row of small scars or tubercules. Some of\r\nthe species are very irregularly ornamented into a sort of wrinkled\r\nsurface, in which the striæ seem, as it were, thrown over the valves in\r\nbundles at random.\r\n\r\nThe productus was furnished with slender hollow spines, which rose up\r\nfrom the surface of either valve, chiefly, however, about the hinge. In\r\n_P. spinosus_ they were long and stout, like thin rush stalks, while in\r\nthe smaller species they rather resembled stiff bristles. The use of\r\nthese spines is not very well made out. As most of the producti appear\r\nto have been free, that is, without any peduncle fixing them to the\r\nsea-bottom, it has been conjectured that the spines, by sinking deep\r\ninto the mud, may have served the place of a peduncle to moor the shell.\r\n\r\nAs regards size, the productus is very variable. You may gather some\r\nspecies in the young form, not larger than peas, while others may\r\nreward your search, having a breadth of six or eight inches (_P.\r\ngiganteus_). But however much they may vary in dimensions, they usually\r\nremain pretty constant in their abundance, being among the most common\r\nfossils of the mountain limestone, and even of some limestones in the\r\ntrue Coal-measures;[37] and that must be a poor stratum indeed which\r\ncannot yield you a bagful of producti.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 37: See the table given below in Chap. X.]\r\n\r\nThe productus no longer ranks among living forms. It began during the\r\ntimes of the Upper Silurian system, lived all through the Old Red\r\nSandstone, and attained its maximum of development in the seas of the\r\nLower Carboniferous group. As the coal forests began to flourish, the\r\nproductus seems to have waned; but it is still sometimes found in\r\nconsiderable numbers in the ironstones and limestones intercalated\r\namong the coal seams of northern England and central Scotland. In the\r\nperiod which succeeded the coal, that, namely, of the Permian, it seems\r\nto have died out altogether, at least no trace of its remains have as\r\nyet been detected in strata of a later age. But whilst it lived, the\r\nproductus must have enjoyed a wide range of climate, for its valves\r\nhave been found by thousands both in the old world and in the new. I\r\nhave seen several that were brought from the hills of China, and they\r\noccur likewise in Thibet. Specimens have been brought, too, from the\r\nwarm plains of Australia, and from the snows of Spitzbergen.\r\n\r\nIn looking over the fossils that lie grouped along beds of the\r\nmountain limestone, there are two forms that we find almost invariably\r\nside by side--the productus and the spirifer. They seem to have\r\nbegun life together, or rather, perhaps, the spirifer is somewhat\r\nthe older brother. They voyaged through the same seas, and anchored\r\nthemselves to the same ocean-bed, sometimes among mud and ooze, and\r\noften among bowers of corals and stone-lilies. They visited together\r\nthe most distant parts of the world, from China to Chili, and from\r\nHudson's Bay to New Zealand. I have sometimes laid open fragments of\r\nlimestone where they lay thickly clustered as though they had ended\r\na life of friendship by dying very lovingly together. But after all\r\nthe varieties of the productus had died out, some species of the\r\nspirifer still lived on, and it was not until the period of the lias\r\nthat they finally disappeared. I remember meeting with one of these\r\nlatest spirifers in the course of a ramble in early morning along the\r\nshores of Pabba, one of the lone sea-girt islands of the Hebrides,\r\nwhere the Scottish secondary rocks are represented. The beach was\r\nformed of low shelving reefs of a dark-brown micaceous shale, richly\r\ncharged with the characteristic fossils of the Lias--ammonites,\r\nbelemnites, gryphææ, pectines, &c. In the course of the walk I came to\r\na lighter coloured band, with many reddish-brown nodules of ironstone,\r\nbut with no observable fossils. A search, however, of a few minutes\r\ndisclosed a weathered specimen, near which a limpet had made good its\r\nresting-place; and this solitary specimen proved to be one of the last\r\nlingering spirifers (_S. Walcottii_). The form struck me at once as a\r\nfamiliar one, and recalled the fossils of the mountain limestone. It\r\nmay seem a puerile fancy, but to one who had lately been working among\r\npalæozoic rocks, and remembered the history of the spirifer, there\r\nwas something suggestive in the loneliness of the specimen. With the\r\nexception of one or two other organisms (as _rhynconella_), it was by\r\nfar the most ancient form of the deposit. Its family had come into the\r\nworld thousands of years before that of the large pinnæ that lay among\r\nthe neighbouring shales, and perhaps millions of years before that of\r\nthe gracefully curved ammonites. But the family was nearly extinct\r\nwhen these shales were being thrown down as sandy mud, and this wasted\r\nspecimen, worn by the dash of the waves, seemed in its solitariness no\r\ninapt representative of an ancient genus that was passing away.\r\n\r\nThe spirifer received its name from the two highly developed spiral\r\nprocesses in the interior of the shell attached to the dorsal valve.\r\nThey were hard, like the substance of the shell, and sprang from\r\nnear the hinge, each diverging outwards to near the border of the\r\nvalve. They resembled two cork-screws, but the loops were much closer\r\ntogether. These coiled calcareous wires almost filled the hollow of the\r\nshell (Fig. 23), and ample support was thus afforded to the filamentous\r\narms. In recent brachiopods, these arms do not always strictly follow\r\nthe course of the calcareous loops. Among palæozoic genera the case may\r\nhave been similar, so that the complex calcareous coil of the spirifer\r\nmay not perhaps indicate a corresponding complexity of the arms. But\r\nnone of the few recent forms exhibit anything like the coiled processes\r\nof the spirifer.\r\n\r\nThe Carboniferous system of Great Britain and Ireland is stated to\r\nhave yielded between fifty and sixty species of spirifers. Of course,\r\nin such a long list the gradations are sometimes very nice, and to an\r\nordinary eye imperceptible, but there exist many marked differences\r\nnotwithstanding. The general type of the spirifers is tolerably well\r\ndefined. They had both valves arched outwards, not concavo-convex as\r\nin the productus. Their hinge-line, like that of the latter shell,\r\nran in a straight line, and their dorsal valve was raised along its\r\ncentre from hinge to outer margin, into a prominent ridge, while in the\r\nventral valve there was a furrow exactly to correspond. Most of the\r\nspecies were traversed by sharp ribs radiating from the centre of the\r\nhinge-line like those on the surface of the common cockle. But some\r\nwere quite smooth, retaining only the high lobe in the centre, such as\r\n_S. glaber_. In a noble specimen figured by M'Coy[38] under the name\r\nof _S. princeps_, the valves are covered with broad plaits that sweep\r\ngracefully outward from the centre of the hinge-line.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 38: _Carb. Limest. Foss. of Ireland_, pl. 21, fig. 1.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 23.--Spirifer hystericus. _b_, Interior of the\r\nsame, showing the arrangement of the spiral arms.]\r\n\r\nThe spirifers vary more in form than in external ornament. Some are\r\ntriangular, others nearly semicircular, others long and attenuated. In\r\nsome species (as the _S. glaber_), the central ridge is very prominent,\r\ntaking up about a third of the entire area of the shell, and thus\r\ngiving it a trilobed appearance. In others (as _S. symmetricus_) it is\r\nless marked, and bears a minor furrow down its centre; while in yet a\r\nthird class (as in some specimens of _S. trigonalis_) the median fold\r\nscarcely rises above the ribs that are ranged on each side.\r\n\r\nThese old shells probably anchored themselves to the sea-bottom by\r\nmeans of a thin peduncle, and lived by the vigorous action of those\r\ncomplex fringed arms, whose screw-like skeleton still occasionally\r\nremains, and which conveyed to the mouth the animal substances that\r\nserved as food.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 24.--Terebratula hastata.]\r\n\r\nI shall refer to but one other brachiopod of the carboniferous rocks,\r\ninteresting both as one of the forms of life still living in our\r\nseas, and as exhibiting, after the lapse of such a vast interval, the\r\nform of the coloured bands which adorned it when alive. It is called\r\n_Terebratula hastata_; a slim delicate shell like its representatives\r\nof the present day, narrow at the beak, and bulging out towards the\r\nouter margin, which is slightly curved. The surface is smooth, and\r\nin the older specimens has numerous concentric layers of growth,\r\nespecially marked near the margin. The stripes of colour radiate from\r\nthe beak, outwards, and though the tint which once brightened them is\r\nno longer visible, it may be that the vessel of the little terebratula,\r\nwhich lay anchored perhaps fifty fathoms down, was well-nigh as\r\ngaily decked as a felucca of the Levant. But the existence of these\r\ncolour-bands is not merely interesting; the geologist can turn it\r\nto account in investigating the physical conditions of an ancient\r\nocean. The late Professor Edward Forbes, after a careful series of\r\ninvestigations in the Mediterranean, brought to light the fact, that\r\nbelow a depth of fifty fathoms shells are but dimly coloured, and hence\r\nhe inferred, from the numerous coloured shells of the carboniferous\r\nlimestone, that the ocean in which they lived was not much more than\r\nfifty fathoms deep.[39]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 39: Similar coloured bands are found even in the Lower\r\nSilurian, e.g., on turbo rupestris (Murchison's _Siluria_, p. 194), while\r\non many of the carboniferous gastropods and lamellibranchiate bivalves,\r\nthey are of frequent occurrence.]\r\n\r\nThe _lamellibranchiate_ bivalve shells of the British Carboniferous\r\nsystem, so far as yet discovered, number about 300 species, belonging\r\nto genera some of which are still familiar to us. There were the\r\n_pectens_ or _scallops_, the _pinnas_ with their beards of byssus,\r\nthe _cardiums_ or cockles, the _mytili_ and _modiolæ_ or mussels,\r\nall sea-shells. Then among the fresh-water bivalves we can detect\r\nseveral species of the unio or river mussel, that perhaps displayed\r\nvalves as silvery in their lining as those of our own pearl-mussels.\r\nBut with these well-known forms there co-existed some that no longer\r\nsurvive. Such was the _conocardium_, a curious form that looks like a\r\n_cardium_ cut through the middle, with a long slender tube added to\r\nthe dismembered side (Fig. 25). The _aviculopecten_, a shell allied to\r\nour common scallop, and sometimes showing still its colour-bands (Fig.\r\n25), and the _cardinia_ or _anthracosia_, a small bivalve that abounds\r\nin the shales and ironstones of our coal-fields, along with nautili,\r\nproducti, and conulariæ at Coalbrook Dale, and with a thin leaf-like\r\nlingula at Borrowstounness.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 25.--Carboniferous Lamellibranchs.\r\n\r\n1. Aviculopecten sublobatus (showing colour-bands). 2. Conocardium\r\naliformis.]\r\n\r\nThe _Gastropods_ of the carboniferous rocks in the British Islands\r\nembrace from twenty-five to thirty genera, with upwards of 200\r\nspecies. Here, too, we can detect some forms that have not yet passed\r\naway. The _trochus_, so universally diffused over the globe at the\r\npresent day, also lived in the palæozoic seas. Its companions, the\r\n_natica_, the _turritella_, and the _turbo_, likewise flourished in\r\nthese ancient waters. Among the genera now extinct we may notice the\r\n_euomphalus_, with its whorls coiled in a flat discoidal form; and the\r\n_bellerophon_, with its simple coiled shell, resembling in general form\r\nthe nautilus. The gastropods are numerously represented in our gardens\r\nand woods, by the various species of the snails, animals that have a\r\nmost extensive distribution over the world, and number probably not\r\nmuch under two thousand species.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 26.--Carboniferous Gastropods.\r\n\r\n1. Euomphalus peatangulatus. 2. Pleurotomaria carinata (showing\r\ncolour-bands).]\r\n\r\nFor a long time it was matter of surprise that no such land shells\r\nhad ever been detected in the carboniferous rocks. Trees and forests\r\nhad been turned up by the hundred, but never a trace was found of\r\nany air-breathing creature. From this fact, and from the enormous\r\namount of vegetable matter preserved, it was once hastily inferred\r\nthat the atmosphere of that ancient period must have been uncongenial\r\nto air-breathers; that, in short, it was a dense heated medium\r\nof noxious carbonic-acid gas, wrapt round the earth like a vast\r\nmephitic exhalation, favourable in the highest degree to the growth\r\nof vegetation, yet deadly as the air of Avernus to all terrestrial\r\nanimals. But this notion, like most other bold deductions from merely\r\nnegative evidence, has had to be abandoned, for traces of air-breathers\r\nhave at last been found. Among these, not the least interesting is\r\nthe shell of a _pupa_, a sort of land-snail, which Sir Charles Lyell\r\ndetected, along with the bones of a small reptile, embedded in the\r\nheart of an upright sigillaria stem in the carboniferous rocks of Nova\r\nScotia. Small as was the organism, the evidence furnished by it proved\r\nscarcely less valuable than if it had been a large mammal that might\r\nhave afforded material for weeks of study. The similarity of the shell\r\nto existing forms, showed that the ancient carboniferous forests had\r\nat least one race of air-breathing creatures among their foliage, and\r\nthat the atmosphere of the period could have differed in no material\r\npoint from that of the present day, for as the snails breathe by lungs,\r\nand require, consequently, a continual supply of oxygen to support\r\nrespiration, they could not have existed in an atmosphere charged with\r\ncarbonic acid.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig 27.--Carboniferous Cephalopods.\r\n\r\n1. Nautilus Koninckii. 2. Goniatites crenistria. 3. Orthoceras laterale\r\n(fragment).]\r\n\r\nThe _Cephalopods_, or highest class of mollusca, are represented among\r\nthe British carboniferous strata by seven genera. Of these the most\r\ncharacteristic is the _orthoceras_, so named from its shell being\r\nlike a long straight horn. When the animal was young it inhabited a\r\nsingle-chambered shell like that of many of the gastropods, but as\r\nit increased in size and prolonged its shell in a straight line, it\r\nwithdrew from the first occupied chamber. This was partitioned off by a\r\nthin wall called a _septum_, through the centre of which a tube ran to\r\nthe narrow end of the shell (Fig. 27). As the creature grew, chamber\r\nafter chamber was in this way formed, each of them quite air-tight, and\r\ntraversed by the central tube. Suppose a graduated series of diminutive\r\nwatch-glasses to be pierced by a long tapering glass-tube in such a\r\nway that they should have their convex faces towards the narrow end of\r\nthe tube, and be arranged at short intervals, the smallest one placed\r\nnear the point of the tube, and the largest a little below the wider\r\nend. Suppose, further, that this piece of mechanism were placed within\r\nanother tube tapering to an obtuse point, and that the edges of the\r\nwatch-glasses fitted tightly to the inner surface of this larger tube.\r\nSuch would be a rough model of the structure of the orthoceras.\r\n\r\nThe inner tube that traverses the centre of the chambers from end\r\nto end of the shell is called the _syphon_, but its uses are very\r\nproblematical. At one time naturalists inclined to regard it as\r\nintended to be filled with fluid, which, by expanding the membrane\r\nof the tube, would compress the air in the chambers, and thus,\r\nincreasing the specific gravity of the animal, enable it to sink to\r\nthe bottom. In this way, by emptying or filling the syphonal tube,\r\nthe orthoceras might have risen rapidly to the surface of the deep,\r\nor sunk as swiftly to the bottom. But this view, so pretty that one\r\nwishes it were confirmed, must be regarded as at least doubtful. The\r\northoceras more probably owed its power of progression to the action of\r\na funnel connected with the breathing apparatus, whereby jets of water\r\nwere squirted out that drove the shell rapidly along. The use of the\r\nair-tight chambers was, perhaps, to give buoyancy to the shell so as to\r\nmake it nearly of the same specific gravity as water. Such a provision\r\nmust have been amply needed, for Professor Owen mentions an orthoceras\r\nfrom Dumfries-shire that measured six feet in length, and similar\r\ngigantic specimens have been found in America. Unless the chambers in\r\nthese shells had been air-tight, the animals that inhabited them would\r\nhave been held down about as firmly to one spot as if they had been\r\ntied to a sheet-anchor. No mollusc could have possessed much locomotion\r\nwith so ponderous a tail, six feet or more in length, to drag after it.\r\nBut this inconvenience was obviated by the simple plan of having the\r\nchambers close, and filled with nitrogen or other gas evolved by the\r\nchemistry of the inmate. The shell, in this way, acquired no little\r\nbuoyancy, and probably stood up like a church spire, the animal keeping\r\nclose to the bottom to lie in wait for any hapless mollusc or trilobite\r\nthat might chance to come in its way.\r\n\r\nThe _nautilus_ (Fig. 27), which still lives in our seas, occurred\r\nlikewise in those of the Carboniferous period. It was a coiled shell;\r\nin truth, just an orthoceras rolled up in one plane like a coil of\r\nwatch-spring. An allied form, called the _goniatite_ (Fig. 27), had\r\nthe margins of its septa of a zig-zag form, like the angles of the\r\nwall round a fortified town. When the thin outer coating of the\r\nshell is removed, the ends of these partition-walls are seen to form\r\nstrongly-marked angulated sutures or joints, where they come in contact\r\nwith the shell. Hence the name of the genus--_angled_ shell.\r\n\r\nAll these animals were predaceous. They did not confine themselves to\r\nthe lower forms of life, polyps and medusæ, nor even to the humbler\r\ntribes of their own sub-kingdom, but hesitated not to wage war with\r\ncreatures greatly higher in the scale of creation than themselves, such\r\nas the smaller fishes. They swarmed in the palæozoic seas, and well\r\nmerited the title of scavengers of the deep, that has been bestowed\r\non the sharks of our own day. They seem to have performed a function\r\nnow divided partly among the fishes and partly among the higher\r\ngastropodous molluscs. And accordingly we find that as these latter\r\ntribes increased, the orthoceratites, and goniatites, and ammonites\r\nwaned. At the present day, of all the palæozoic cephalopods there\r\nremains but one--the nautilus[40]; a and so rare is it, that up to\r\nthe year 1832, all sorts of fanciful notions existed as to its nature\r\nand functions. In fact, the nautilus was a sort of myth which any\r\nnaturalist could dress up as he chose, much as the old poets used to\r\npicture the ship Argo. A specimen was at length procured and intrusted\r\nto the examination of Professor Owen, by whom its anatomy was studied,\r\nand afterwards philosophically described in an elaborate monograph.\r\nThen, for the first time, did geologists obtain a true notion of the\r\nnature of those siphonated shells, which lie grouped by hundreds in the\r\npalæozoic and secondary formations. Yet we still want an account of the\r\nhabits of the nautilus. The older naturalists alleged that it could\r\nat pleasure rise to the surface or sink into the depths of the ocean;\r\nthat it could spread out its fleshy arms and float across the waves or\r\ndraw them in, capsize the little vessel, and so return to a creeping\r\nposture among the sea-weed at the bottom. These statements may to some\r\nextent be true, for the chambers of the nautilus shell must impart\r\ngreat buoyancy to it. But in the meantime the story of the sailing\r\npropensities of the animal is derived from a sort of mythic age, and\r\nmust be viewed with some little suspicion. Until further observations\r\nare made, we shall neither fully understand the economy of the nautilus\r\nnor the habits of the cephalopods of the palæozoic seas. But the day\r\nis probably not far distant when such doubts will be set at rest, and\r\nwe shall know whether the nautili and orthoceratites swam in argosies\r\nover the surface of the ocean, or, keeping ever at the bottom, left the\r\nwaves to roll far above them, unvaried save perchance by some floating\r\nsea-weed or drifted tree.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 40: And perhaps even that is doubtful, for it is not unlikely\r\nthat after all, the palæozoic nautili may belong in reality to another\r\ngenus. Twenty years hence will probably see no little change on our\r\npresent identifications.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Classification of the naturalist not always correspondent with\r\n       the order of nature--Incongruous grouping of animals\r\n       in the invertebrate division--Rudimentary skeleton\r\n       of the cephalopods--Introduction of the vertebrate\r\n       type into creation--Ichthyolites of the carboniferous\r\n       rocks--Their state of keeping--Classification of fossil\r\n       fishes--Placoids--Ichthyodorulites--Ganoids--Their structure\r\n       exemplified in the megalichthys and holoptychius--Cranium of\r\n       megalichthys--Its armature of scales--Microscopic structure of\r\n       a scale--Skeleton of megalichthys--History of the discovery\r\n       of the holoptychius--Confounded with megalichthys--External\r\n       ornament of holoptychius--Its jaws and teeth--Microscopic\r\n       structure of the teeth--Paucity of terrestrial fauna in coal\r\n       measures--Insect remains--Relics of reptiles--Concluding\r\n       summary of the characters of the carboniferous fauna--Results.\r\n\r\nThe organic remains hitherto described belong to that large division\r\nof the animal kingdom instituted by Lamarck, to comprehend all those\r\nwhose internal structure is supported by no vertebral column, and\r\nwhich are hence termed invertebrate. They are for the most part\r\nprotected by a hard outer covering, or exo-skeleton, which assumes\r\nmany different modifications. We have seen it in the calcareous\r\ncells of the little net-like fenestella, in the geometric cup of\r\nthe stone-lily, in the double case of the cypris, and in the shells\r\nof the mollusca. But the order of nature does not always exactly\r\ncorrespond with the classification of the naturalist. His system\r\nmust necessarily be precise, formal, and defined. One tribe ends off\r\nabruptly, and is immediately succeeded by another, with different\r\nfunctions and structure, and dignified with a separate name. But in\r\nthe order of creation, such abrupt demarcations are few, for if they\r\nexist in the present economy, they can not unfrequently be filled up\r\nfrom the existences of the past. There is usually a shading off of\r\none class into another, like the blending of the tints of sunset,\r\nand it often baffles all the skill of the profoundest anatomist, by\r\ndrawing a distinct line, to pronounce where the one division actually\r\nends and the other begins. Any name, therefore, which is intended to\r\nembrace a large section of the animal kingdom, must ever be more or\r\nless arbitrary. It will extend too far in one direction, and embrace\r\norganisms which might be classed in a different section. It will\r\nprobably not extend far enough in another, and thus leave beyond its\r\npale animals possessing strong affinities to the majority of those\r\nincluded under it. More especially is this true of every system of\r\nclassification that proceeds upon the modifications of a single\r\nfeature, or upon mere negative resemblances. Suppose, for instance,\r\nthat it were proposed by some highly systematic individual to divide\r\nthe inhabitants of our country into two great classes--the bearded\r\nand the beardless. In the latter category he would arrange all the\r\nmore quiet and orderly portion of the community, with perchance a\r\ntolerable intermixture of rogues. The bearded group would present a\r\nmost motley array--from the fierce-visaged heroes of the Crimea to the\r\npeaceable stone-mason or begrimed pitman--all brought into one list,\r\nand yet agreeing in no single feature save that of being like Bully\r\nBottom the weaver, \"marvellous hairy about the face.\" But Lamarck's\r\ninvertebrate division of the animal kingdom presents a grouping of yet\r\nmore diverse characteristics, as cannot fail to be confessed when we\r\nrecollect that it embraces among its members the microscopic monad,\r\nthe coral polyp, the lobster, the butterfly, the limpet, the nautilus,\r\nand the cuttle-fish. Cuvier's three-fold grouping of the division\r\ninto _mollusca_, _articulata_, and _radiata_, has now supplanted the\r\nold name, though the latter is still retained as a sort of convenient\r\ndesignation for all the animals below the vertebrate type.\r\n\r\nThe most highly developed of the recent cephalopods exhibit a true\r\ninternal skeleton, in the form of a strong oblong bone, on which the\r\nbody is hung. In this respect they occupy a sort of intermediate place\r\nbetween the lower molluscs on the one hand, and the lower fishes on\r\nthe other. Theirs is not a vertebral column, but rather, as it were,\r\na foreshadowing of it; not, however, as a link in some process of\r\nself-development from mollusc to fish, for these higher cephalopods do\r\nnot appear to have been created until fishes and reptiles had lived\r\nfor ages. The vertebrate type has been traced well-nigh as far back\r\ninto the past as we have yet been able to penetrate. Once introduced,\r\nit has never ceased to exist, but in the successive geological ages\r\nhas been ever receiving newer and higher modifications, reaching its\r\nperfection at length in man. The vertebrate form of structure fulfils\r\nthe highest adaptations of which terrestrial beings seem capable. We\r\ncan hardly conceive of corporeal existence reaching a more elevated\r\nstage of development, save in thereby becoming less material, and\r\nreceiving an impartation of some higher element. The vertebrate\r\nanimals display not merely the most complexly organized structures,\r\nbut manifest in their habits the workings of the higher instincts\r\nand affections. Among the invertebrate tribes the propagation of the\r\nspecies is, in the vast majority of cases, a mere mechanical function,\r\nlike that of feeding or respiration, and the eggs once deposited, the\r\nparent has no further care of her young. But among the vertebrated\r\nanimals, on the other hand, the perpetuation of the race forms the\r\ncentral pillar round which the natural affections are entwined. It\r\nparcels out every species into pairs, in each of which the mates are\r\nbound together by the strongest ties of attachment. It gives birth,\r\ntoo, to that noble instinct which leads the mother to expose her own\r\nlife rather than suffer harm to come to her offspring. It produces, at\r\nleast in man, that reciprocal attachment of offspring to parent, from\r\nwhich springs no small part of all that is holiest and best in this\r\nworld. These attributes, to a greater or less extent, belong to all\r\nthe vertebrate animals, from the fish up to man. In looking over the\r\nrelics of animal life in the earlier geological formations, we are apt,\r\nas we gaze on the massive jaws and teeth, the strong bony armour, and\r\nthe sharp, barbed spines, to think only of a time of war and carnage,\r\nwhen the larger forms preyed upon the smaller, or ruthlessly sought\r\nto exterminate each other. Yet should we not remember, that with all\r\nthese weapons and instincts of self-preservation there were linked\r\nattributes of a nobler kind; that the earliest vertebrate remains point\r\nto the introduction--though perhaps in but a rudimentary form--of\r\nself-sacrificing love into our planet? The march of creation from\r\nthe first dawn of life has ever been an onward one, as regards the\r\ndevelopment not only of organic structure but of the social relations;\r\nand if it be true that physical organization finds its archetype in\r\nman, it is assuredly no less so that in him too we meet with the\r\nhighest manifestation of those instincts which, by linking individual\r\nto individual, have ever marked out the vertebrate tribes of animals\r\nfrom the more machine-like characteristics of the invertebrate.\r\n\r\nWe pass now to the vertebrate animals, and shall look for a little into\r\nthe general grade and organization of the fishes that characterized the\r\ncarboniferous rivers and seas.\r\n\r\nA collection of the ichthyolites of the carboniferous rocks presents\r\nalmost every variety in the mode of preservation. The smaller species\r\nare frequently found entire, and show their shining scales still\r\nregularly imbricated as when the creatures were alive. The larger forms\r\nseldom occur in other than a very fragmentary condition. The limestones\r\nyield dark-brown or black, oblong, leech-like teeth, which are found\r\non examination to be those of an ancient family of sharks. The shales\r\nare often sprinkled over with glittering scales and enamelled bones.\r\nSome of the coals and ironstones yield in abundance long sculptured\r\nspines, huge jaws bristling with sharp conical teeth, and detached\r\ntusks, sometimes five or six inches long. In short, the naturalist who\r\nwould decipher the ichthyology of the Coal formation, finds before\r\nhim, in the rocks, not a suite of correctly arranged, and carefully\r\npreserved skeletons, but a set of disjointed, unconnected bones; here\r\na tooth, there a scale, now a jaw, now a dermal plate, all mingled at\r\nrandom. And yet, though the evidence lie in this fragmentary state, our\r\nknowledge of these ancient fishes is far from being correspondingly\r\nmeagre. To such precision has the science of comparative anatomy\r\narrived, that a mere scale or tooth is often enough to indicate the\r\nnature and functions of the individual to which it belonged, and to\r\nestablish the existence in former times of a particular class or order\r\nof animals. Thus the smooth rounded teeth of the mountain limestone are\r\nfound to present both externally and internally a close resemblance to\r\nthe hinder flat teeth of the sole living cestraciont (_C. Philippi_);\r\nand we hence learn that a family of sharks, now all but extinct,\r\nabounded in the palæozoic seas. The occurrence of a set of dark,\r\nrounded little objects, which by the unpractised eye would be apt to be\r\nmistaken for pebbles, is in this way sufficient at once to augment our\r\nknowledge of the various animals of the Carboniferous period, and to\r\nestablish an important fact in the history of creation.\r\n\r\nOf the four great Orders into which Agassiz[41] subdivided the class\r\n_Pisces_, the Placoids and Ganoids, agreeing on the whole with the\r\ncartilaginous fishes of Cuvier, occur abundantly in the palæozoic\r\nrocks, while the Cycloids and Ctenoids, answering to Cuvier's\r\nosseous fishes, began in the Secondary formations, and are found in\r\nall subsequent deposits. The two former reached their maximum in the\r\nearlier geological ages, and have been gradually dwindling down ever\r\nsince, till now they are represented by comparatively few genera; the\r\ntwo latter are emphatically modern orders; they have been constantly\r\nincreasing in numbers since their creation, and swarm in every sea at\r\nthe present day. The carboniferous ichthyolites belong, of course, only\r\nto the two first-mentioned orders the placoids and ganoids.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 41: The classification of Agassiz, which is certainly not\r\na little arbitrary and artificial, has been altered by Müller, a\r\ndistinguished German anatomist, whose arrangement has been modified\r\nagain by Professor Owen. See Owen's _Lectures on Comparative Anatomy_,\r\nvol. ii. p. 47. There is far from anything like unanimity on the\r\nsubject. Every naturalist thinks himself at liberty to modify and\r\nrestrict the groupings of his predecessors or contemporaries, sometimes\r\nwithout condescending to give synonyms or any clue by which one may\r\ncompare the rival classifications. The geological student cannot engage\r\nin a more sickening task than that of ranging through these various\r\narrangements, and he must possess some self-command who can refrain\r\nfrom throwing up the search in disgust. The best way of progressing is\r\nto select some standard work and keep to it, until the characteristics\r\nof the genera and families have been mastered, and as far as possible,\r\nverified from actual observation. After such preliminary training, the\r\nstudent will be more able to grope his way through the \"chaos and dark\r\nnight\" of synonyms and systems.]\r\n\r\nThe Placoid, or _Plagiostome_ fishes, are familiar to us all as\r\nexemplified in the common thornback and skate of our markets. They are\r\ncovered with a tough skin, which either supports a set of tuberculed\r\nplates as in the thornback, or a thick crop of small rounded bony\r\npoints or plates, as in the shagreen of the sharks. The head consists\r\nof a single cartilaginous box. The spinal column is likewise formed\r\nof cartilage, built up in the higher genera of partially ossified\r\nvertebræ. The tail is heterocercal or unequally lobed, inasmuch as\r\nthe spinal column, instead of ending off abruptly as it does in the\r\nherring, trout, and all our commoner fishes, passes on to the extreme\r\npoint of the upper half of the tail. This is a noticeable feature, for\r\nit has been found to characterize all the fishes that lived in the\r\nearlier geological periods. The fins are often strengthened by strong\r\nspines of bone, which stand up in front of them and serve the double\r\npurpose of organs of progression and weapons of defence. The teeth vary\r\na good deal in form. In the larger number of existing placoids they\r\nare of a sharp cutting shape, often with saw-like edges. Among the\r\nsharks they run along the jaws in numerous rows, of which, however,\r\nonly the outer one is used, those behind lying in reserve to fill up\r\nthe successive gaps in the front rank. The teeth do not sink into the\r\njaw, as in the ganoids, but are merely bound together by the tough\r\nintegument which forms the lips. Another form of tooth, abundant among\r\nthe ancient placoids, and visible on some of those at the present\r\nday, shows a smooth rounded surface, the teeth being closely grouped\r\ntogether into a sort of tessellated pavement which, in the recent\r\nspecies, runs round the inner part of the jaws, while a row of conical\r\nteeth guards the entrance of the mouth.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 28.--Ctenacanthus hybodoides. (Edgerton.)]\r\n\r\nThe animals which possess these characteristics include the various\r\ntribes of the sharks and rays, and form the highest group of fishes.\r\nThey are all active and predaceous, frequenting every part of the ocean\r\nwhere their prey is to be found. The formidable spines and hideous\r\n\"chasm of teeth\" belonging to the bulkier forms, render them more than\r\na match for any other denizens of the deep, and thus they reign in\r\nundisputed supremacy--the scourge of their congeners, and a terror to\r\nman.\r\n\r\nThe seas of the Carboniferous era abounded with similar predaceous\r\nfishes, some of which must have been of enormous size. An entire\r\nspecimen has never been obtained; nor, from the destructible nature\r\nof the animal framework, can we expect to meet with one. But the hard\r\nbony parts of the animals, those capable in short of preservation\r\nin mineral accumulations, are of common occurrence in the mountain\r\nlimestone beds and even among the coal seams. The dorsal spines or\r\n_ichthyodorulites_, are especially conspicuous (Fig. 28). They stood\r\nup along the creature's back like masts, the fin which was attached to\r\nthe hinder margin of each, representing the sail. The spine could be\r\nraised or depressed at pleasure, its movements regulating those of the\r\nfin, much as the raising or lowering of the mast in a boat influences\r\nthe lug-sail that is attached to it. The general form of these spines\r\nwas long, tapering, and more or less rounded. But they assumed many\r\nvarieties of surface ornament. Some species were ribbed longitudinally,\r\nand had along their posterior concave side a set of little hooks\r\nsomewhat like the thorns of a rose. Others seem to have been quite\r\nsmooth, and of a flattened shape, with a thick-set row of sharp hooks\r\ndown both of the edges, like the spine on the tail of the sting-ray\r\nof the Mediterranean. Such weapons have considerable resemblance to\r\nthe barbed spear-heads of savage tribes, and it is certain they were\r\nintended to act in a similar way, as at once offensive and defensive\r\narms. The toothed spines of the sting-rays are still used in some\r\nparts of the world to point the warrior's spear and arrow. Is there\r\nnot something suggestive in the fact that these stings, after having\r\naccomplished their appointed purpose as weapons of war in the great\r\ndeep, should come to be employed over again in a like capacity on the\r\nland; and that an instrument, which was designed by the Creator as a\r\nmeans of protecting its possessor, should be turned by man into an\r\nimplement for gratifying his cupidity and satiating his revenge? Other\r\nichthyodorulites are elegantly ornamented by long rows of tuberculed\r\nlines arranged in a zig-zag fashion, or in straight rows tapering from\r\nbase to point. In all there was a blunt unornamented base, which sank\r\ninto the back and served as a point of attachment for the muscles\r\nemployed in raising or depressing the spine. In some specimens the\r\nouter point appears rounded and worn, the characteristic ornament being\r\neffaced for some distance--a circumstance which probably indicates that\r\nthese fishes frequented the more rocky parts of the sea.[42]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 42: See Egerton, _Quart. Jour. Geol. Soc._, vol. ix. p. 281.]\r\n\r\nThe placoid teeth of the carboniferous rocks show the usual forms\r\nof the order. Some of them are sharp and pointed, as those of the\r\nhybodonts; others have a smooth, rounded, or plate-like form, as in the\r\ncestracionts. The latter often show a dark brilliant surface, and might\r\nbe readily enough mistaken for well-worn pebbles. In the oblong rounded\r\nteeth of _psammodus_ the surface is densely covered with minute points\r\nlike grains of sand, whence the name of the genus. These teeth, when\r\nsliced and viewed under the microscope by transmitted light, exhibit a\r\ncomplex reticulated internal structure.\r\n\r\nAgassiz' second great Order of fishes is named Ganoid, from a Greek\r\nword signifying brightness, in allusion to the brightly enamelled\r\nsurface of their dermal covering. They differ from the placoids in\r\nhaving their outer surface cased in a strong armature of bone, which\r\nis disposed either in the form of large overlapping plates, as among\r\nthe strange tortoise-like fishes of the Old Red Sandstone, or as thick\r\nscales, which are either placed at intervals, as along the back and\r\nsides of the sturgeon, or closely imbricated, as in the stony-gar\r\n(_lepidosteus_) of the American rivers. This strong, massive skeleton\r\nconstitutes in many genera the sole support of the animal framework,\r\nthe inner skeleton being of a gristly cartilaginous kind, like that\r\nof the skate. On this account traces of the vertebral column are by\r\nno means abundant among the older formations. But as the ganoids form\r\na sort of intermediate link between the placoid or gristly fishes\r\non the one hand, and the bony fishes on the other, they are found\r\nto present in their different genera examples of both these kinds\r\nof structure. Thus, the skeleton of the sturgeon consists of a firm\r\ncartilage, out of which the vertebræ are moulded, so that this fish\r\nwas at one time ranked with the sharks in the cartilaginous tribe of\r\nCuvier. The skeletons of some of the older ganoids (as _holoptychius_),\r\non the other hand, manifest such a decidedly osseous structure, with\r\nsometimes so much of a reptilian cast, that the bones were at first\r\nreferred to some huge extinct saurians. The head of the ganoid fishes\r\nis encased in a set of large massive plates of bone, and the jaws\r\nare furnished with several rows of small sharp teeth, intermingled\r\nwith a less numerous but larger-sized and more formidable kind. The\r\ninterior of the mouth likewise displayed in many ancient genera groups\r\nof palatal teeth, so that the dental apparatus of these animals\r\nmust have been very complex and complete. The tail in all the older\r\nganoids was heterocercal, like that of the sharks, the lobes being\r\nnot unfrequently densely covered with minute overlapping scales of\r\nbone--a peculiarity which also extended to the fins. But the fins\r\nwere sometimes strengthened in another way by having the foremost ray\r\ngreatly thickened and enlarged, so as to form a stiff spine like the\r\nichthyodorulites of the placoids. The whole of the external surface\r\nof these ganoidal fishes glittered with enamel, and was usually\r\nsculptured in the most graceful patterns or ornamented with fine\r\nlines and punctures so minute as to be almost invisible to the naked\r\neye. Every plate, scale, fin-ray, nay, the very lips exhibited the\r\ncharacteristic enamel mottled over with the style of ornament peculiar\r\nto the species. And when we think we have exhausted the contemplation\r\nof these beauties, it needs but a glance through an ordinary microscope\r\nto assure us that the unassisted eye catches only a superficial glimpse\r\nof them. The more highly we magnify any portion of these old-world\r\nmummies, the more exquisite does its structure appear.\r\n\r\nIn the carboniferous rocks of Great Britain, upwards of forty species\r\nof ganoids have been detected. They have a wide range in size, the\r\nsmallest measuring scarce two or three inches, while the largest, to\r\njudge at least from the bones which they have left behind, must have\r\nreached a length of twenty, or perhaps even thirty feet The lesser\r\ngenera (Fig. 29) were characterized by small, angular, glossy scales,\r\nusually ornamented either with a very minute punctulation, or with\r\nfine hair-like lines which sometimes exhibited the most complicated\r\npatterns. The scales were likewise occasionally serrated along the\r\nexposed edges--a style of ornament which gives no little richness to\r\nthe aspect of the dermal covering. The fins, closely imbricated with\r\nsmall angular scales of bone, sometimes displayed a striated ray in\r\nfront, but this neither possessed the strength nor the formidable\r\naspect of the corresponding spine among the placoids. The head was\r\nencased in a set of bony plates fitting tightly into each other, and\r\nornamented with various patterns according to the species. The teeth\r\nwere very small and fine, resembling the bristles of a brush, but in\r\nat least some species intermingled with teeth of a larger size. The\r\nminute style of dentition in these smaller fishes has been thought to\r\nindicate their habit of keeping to the bottom of the water and feeding\r\non the soft decaying substances lying there. Nowhere have I seen the\r\nsmall rhomboidal scales of the _palæoniscus_ so abundant as among dark\r\nshales charged with cypris cases and fragments of terrestrial plants,\r\nand on such occasions the idea has often occurred that these graceful\r\nlittle fishes, like the _amia_ of the American rivers, may have fed on\r\nthe cyprides that swarmed along the bottom of the estuary.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 29.--Amblypterus macropterus (a Carboniferous\r\nganoid).]\r\n\r\nScattered over the fresh-water limestones, ironstones, and shales, or\r\ncrowded together along the upper surface of some of the coal-seams,\r\nthere occur the remains of two very remarkable ganoidal fishes. They\r\ndeserve our attention for their great size, their complex organization,\r\nand the important place in the scale of animal life which they occupied\r\nduring a former period. One of them has been called _megalichthys_\r\nor _great fish_--an unhappy name, since the animal did not reach the\r\ndimensions attained by not a few of the other ganoids, and was even\r\nsurpassed by at least one of its contemporary congeners. The other\r\nis known as the _holoptychius_ or _wrinkled scale_. A more detailed\r\nexamination of these two animals will perhaps best enable us to\r\nunderstand the character of the ganoid fishes that lived in the waters\r\nof the Carboniferous period.\r\n\r\nThe megalichthys had an average length of about three feet. Like\r\nthe other members of the ganoid order it had a glittering exterior,\r\nevery scale and plate being formed of strong bone, and coated with a\r\nbright layer of enamel. Wherever this polished surface extends, it is\r\nfound to be ornamented with a minute punctulation, the pores of which\r\nlie thickly together like the finer dots of a stippled engraving.\r\nThe cranial plates are further varied by a scattered and irregular\r\nseries of larger punctures that look as if they had been formed by the\r\ninsertion of a pin-point into a soft yielding surface. The examination\r\nof the head of the megalichthys as depicted in Fig. 30, will convey an\r\nadequate conception of the structure of a ganoidal cranium.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 30.--Head of Megalichthys Hibberti, one-sixth of\r\nnatural size (Agass. _Poiss. Foss._ Tab. 63).\r\n\r\nA Upper side. B. Under side. C Profile.]\r\n\r\nThe snout is formed of an elegantly curved bone (_c_) fringed along\r\nits under edge with minute thick-set teeth. On either side it is\r\nflanked by two triangular plates, which occupy the space between the\r\nintermaxillary bone (_c_) and the upper jaws (_q q_). The eye orbits\r\nseem to have been at the corners of the intermaxillary, circumscribed\r\nby the sub-orbitals (_f g h_) and the ethmoids (_b_). The massive\r\nintermaxillary bone had its posterior margin of an angular form, and\r\ninto the notch thus formed there was wedged the anterior end of a long\r\nstrip of plates, which expanded as they approached the occipital part\r\nof the cranium, and terminated in three irregular plates that may\r\nrepresent the place of the parietal and occipital bones. The space\r\nbetween this belt and the upper jaws was occupied by three large plates\r\n(_i k l_) which in other ganoids, as the _osteolepis_ of the Old Red\r\nSandstone, were united into a single pre-opercular bone of considerable\r\nsize. The operculum or gill cover (_m_) was relatively large, and\r\nhad an elegantly curved anterior margin. The upper jaws (_q_) were\r\ncomparatively small, and had a fringe of small conical teeth. The under\r\njaws (_r r_) reached to nearly double the length of the upper, and were\r\nsimilarly set round with teeth. The teeth of the megalichthys, like\r\nthose of the living lepidosteus, consisted of two kinds, of which the\r\none bristled thickly along the outer edge of the jaw as sharp minute\r\npoints, averaging about a line in length, while behind this outer row\r\nlay a scattered series of much larger teeth that sometimes rose nearly\r\nan inch above the jaw. The external surface of these more formidable\r\ntusks is smooth, glittering, and minutely striated with fine lines from\r\nbase to point, while the root of each is farther marked by a circle of\r\nshort, deep, longitudinal furrows. The internal structure displays a\r\nclose ivory, which when viewed under a microscope is seen to be made up\r\nof fine tubes radiating from the outer surface to the hollow central\r\ncavity. Some of the bones in the interior of the mouth seem to have\r\nbeen also furnished with an apparatus of teeth. The under surface of\r\nthe cranium between the arch of the under jaws consists of two oblong\r\ncentral plates (_t_) surrounded by a row of sixteen irregular ones,\r\neight on each side, and terminated in front by a large lozenge-shaped\r\nscale (_u_) which fits into their angle of junction on the one side,\r\nand into the symphysis of the jaws on the other. In the osteolepis\r\nthere were likewise two large plates terminating in a similar\r\nlozenge-shaped one, but without the flanking rows. In the famous Old\r\nRed holoptychius of Clashbennie, the under surface of the head had\r\nbut two plates, and in the still older and more gigantic asterolepis,\r\nthere was but one. It is the delightful task of the paleontologist\r\nto compare and contrast these various pieces of mechanism, to mark\r\nhow what seems lacking in one comes to be supplied in another, and to\r\ntrace out the various modes in which, during the ages of the past,\r\nNature has wrought out the same leading plan, sounding, as it were, an\r\never-changing series of modulations upon one key-note. In comparing\r\ntogether the ganoids of the Old Red Sandstone and the Carboniferous\r\nrocks, he finds that in the asterolepis--a fish belonging to the lower\r\npart of the former formation--the pointed arch formed by the sweep of\r\nthe lower jaws is filled up by a single plate like some abbey-window\r\nwith its mullions knocked away, and built up with rude stone and lime.\r\nHigher in the same group of rocks he meets with the cranium of the\r\nholoptychius, where there is one straight central mullion running\r\nin an unbroken line from the angle of the arch to its base. In the\r\nosteolepis[43] he sees this mullion branching into two at its upper\r\nend, so that the window consists of three divisions, as in the simplest\r\nstyle of Gothic. Passing upwards into the Carboniferous system, he\r\nencounters a still more ornate arrangement in the cranium of the\r\nmegalichthys. The central mullion with its two upper branches still\r\nremains, but it is flanked by an additional one on each side, from\r\nwhich there spring six cross bars that diverge obliquely with a slight\r\ncurve, so as to join the outer arch and subdivide the window into\r\nnineteen compartments. So varied are the plans of the Divine Architect\r\nin what to man may seem such a little matter as the piecing together of\r\na fish's skull.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 43: Hugh Miller's _Footprints of the Creator_, p. 91.]\r\n\r\nThe body of the megalichthys was cased in an armature of as solid and\r\nglittering bone as that which defended its head. Where the plates of\r\nthe cranium ended off they were succeeded by large rhomboidal scales\r\nthat crossed the body obliquely, and overlapped each other like the\r\nmetal plates in the antique scale-armour. Each scale consisted of\r\ntwo parts, of which one had a rhomboid form and was covered over with\r\nenamel, while the other ran round the two inner sides of the rhomb\r\nas a broad unenamelled selvage deeply indented along its centre. It\r\nwas the enamelled portion alone that formed the outer surface, the\r\nrough unpolished border being covered by the overlapping edges of\r\nthe adjoining scales. The scales had not a uniform thickness, but\r\nwere strongest at the covered part from which each thinned off to\r\nthe outer edges. In this way the thin edge of one scale pressed down\r\non the thick part of the subjacent one, and a covering of uniform\r\nstrength and smoothness was produced. Looking at a set of these scales\r\nas they still occupy their original position on the creature's body,\r\nit is scarcely more than a half of each which meets our eye; for the\r\nunenamelled border occupied about a third of the entire surface, and\r\na fourth of the remainder was covered by the overlapping scales. The\r\neffect of this arrangement must have been to combine great strength\r\nwith the most perfect flexibility. Notwithstanding the bulk of his\r\nhelmet and the weight of his scale-armour, we cannot conceive the\r\nmegalichthys to have been other than a lithe, active, predaceous fish,\r\ndealing death and destruction among the herring-like shoals of little\r\npalæonisci and amblypteri, though able to maintain perhaps but a\r\ndoubtful warfare with his more bulky contemporary, the holoptychius.\r\nThe internal structure of the scales of the megalichthys exhibits the\r\nsame provision for combining strength with the least possible amount\r\nof material. Viewed in a transverse section under a magnifying power\r\nof about eight diameters, they are seen to consist of three layers of\r\nbone; each possessing a peculiar structure. The outermost is formed\r\nof a tessellated pavement of minute round ocelli, having a fine brown\r\ncolour, and placed close together with considerable regularity. They\r\nsomewhat resemble little wheels, the axle being either a dark solid\r\nnucleus or a small circular aperture, whence there radiates to the\r\nouter rim a set of exceedingly minute fibres which were originally\r\nhollow, and served as canals to carry on the growth of the scale. The\r\nvacant space left where four wheels impinge on each other, forms one\r\nof the pores that cover the enamelled surface of the scale. The whole\r\nstructure of this outer layer very closely resembles that presented by\r\nthe internal part of the base of the teeth, save that the confluent\r\nlobes shown in the teeth become in the scale detached into separate and\r\nindependent circles. The central stratum of each scale is composed of\r\na loose open network of cancellated bone that passes into the layer on\r\neither side, and resembles in its general texture the osseous vertebræ\r\nof the same fish. The under layer, one end of which rested immediately\r\non the skin, approaches more to the firmness and solidity of the outer\r\none, but, in place of a tessellated, ivory-like pavement, it had a\r\nclose fibrous texture, with here and there a scattered cavity, and the\r\nfibres were matted together so as to resemble the more solid structure\r\nof the cranial bones. The effect of this triple arrangement must have\r\nbeen to impart great strength and lightness to the external armature\r\nof the fish; the middle spongy layer serving, by its porosity, at once\r\nto deaden the effect of any blow aimed at the outside, and to give\r\nbuoyancy and lightness to what would otherwise have been a coat of\r\nmail well-nigh, as ponderous as that of a feudal chief. One can hardly\r\nconceive any implement of warfare in use among the lower animals of\r\nstrength enough to pierce this massive covering. But we shall find\r\nas we go on that if the megalichthys had a strong defensive armour,\r\na bulkier neighbour had a still stronger offensive one, and that the\r\nenamelled plates of the one fish were scarcely a match for the huge\r\npointed tusks of the other.\r\n\r\nThe megalichthys had an osseous skeleton, with vertebræ of a discoidal\r\nform. These internal bones when viewed under the microscope are found\r\nto display an open cancellated structure, resembling that of the\r\ncentral layer in the scales. It thus appears that this ancient fish\r\nwas not merely defended by a hard external armour, but possessed an\r\nequally solid framework of bone within.\r\n\r\nMingled with the scales and bones of the megalichthys, there are found\r\nthe remains of a still larger fish, to which the name of Holoptychius\r\nhas been given. Its external ornament differed entirely from that of\r\nthe animal last described. It possessed teeth sometimes six or seven\r\ntimes larger, and jaws, plates, and bones of a form and dimensions\r\ntotally distinct. Strange as it may seem, however, these two fishes\r\nhave been constantly and systematically confounded from the time when\r\nthey were first discovered. Two or three years ago, there might be\r\nseen in the British Museum several specimens of the holoptychius,\r\nof which some bore the correct name, while the rest were labelled\r\n\"Megalichthys;\" and a similar error prevailed in several of the other\r\nmuseums.[44] The confusion can be traced very distinctly in the memoir\r\nof Dr. Hibbert, who for the first time described the remains of these\r\nfishes, and wrote according to information received from Agassiz.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 44: The mistake was noticed in 1845 by Hugh Miller, who, in a\r\nfoot-note to his _First Impressions of England and its People_, p. 71,\r\nwell defines the distinctions between the two ichthyolites.]\r\n\r\nIn the autumn of 1832, the attention of the scientific public of\r\nEdinburgh was directed to the extraordinary character of some fossil\r\nremains obtained from the lime-quarries of Burdiehouse, a village about\r\nfour miles to the south of the town. Dr. Hibbert visited the locality,\r\nand soon saw enough to excite his lively interest in its thorough\r\ninvestigation. The Royal Society of Edinburgh warmly supported his\r\nexertions, and by their means a large suite of specimens was eventually\r\nobtained, which the Doctor from time to time described as they were\r\nsuccessively received. At the meeting[45] of the British Association in\r\nEdinburgh, in 1834, the specimens were exhibited before the Geological\r\nSection, and a memoir upon them read by their successful discoverer.\r\nOn the conclusion of the paper, a lively discussion ensued upon the\r\nnature of the animal to which the scales and teeth had belonged.\r\nDr. Hibbert argued, from the deeply-furrowed teeth, and the strong,\r\nmassive cranial plates, that the animal must have been a reptile, and\r\nsupported his assertion by no small amount of anatomical skill. In the\r\nmidst of the discussion, a message was sent to the great ichthyologist\r\nof Neufchatel, who happened to be at that time busily engaged in the\r\nZoological Section. Passing over the fossils as they lay grouped\r\nupon the table, with that quick perception for which he is so justly\r\ncelebrated, Agassiz at once decided that the bones must have been\r\nthose of some large and hitherto undescribed _fish_. Such a decision\r\nfrom such an authority produced of course no little sensation, and the\r\nnaturalist was told with some surprise that the remains had just been\r\nelaborately described as those of extinct reptiles. \"Reptiles!\" thought\r\nAgassiz, and again his quick eye darted over the table; but the fossils\r\nwould yield no other answer than what they had already given. Despite\r\ntheir seeming reptilian character, they were undoubtedly ichthyic,\r\nthough belonging to an animal up to that time unknown. In the completed\r\nmemoir which Dr. Hibbert subsequently submitted to the Royal Society,\r\nhis mistake was freely acknowledged, and the remains there flourish as\r\nthose of a true fish. But with this amendment a grave error of another\r\nkind was committed, though in this the Doctor seems to have been\r\nsupported by the authority of Agassiz himself. The large bones, scales,\r\nand teeth of the Burdiehouse limestone, were all indiscriminately\r\nthrown into one genus, to which Agassiz gave the name of Megalichthys;\r\nand in the memoir we find the different kinds of scales and teeth\r\ndescribed and figured without the slightest intimation or suspicion\r\nthat they might possibly have belonged to different animals. The\r\nnovelty of the discoveries soon attracted general attention to\r\nDr. Hibbert's paper. It was quoted or referred to in almost every\r\nscientific work treating of general geology, while in some instances\r\n(as in Dr. Buckland's _Bridgewater Treatise_) the erroneously-named\r\nbones were re-engraved. A tooth from the Fife coal-field, drawn\r\nfor one of the woodcuts in a popular elementary manual, was also\r\nnamed megalichthys; an error perpetuated through every edition till\r\nthe last, where the tooth has been restored to its true owner--the\r\nholoptychius. In truth, no two organisms have ever been so maltreated;\r\nand if the reader will kindly bear with me a little further, it will\r\nnot be difficult to show him that the holoptychius had peculiarities\r\nof its own quite as distinct as those that have come before us in the\r\nmegalichthys, and that each animal has a full and legitimate claim to a\r\nseparate and independent niche in the gallery of fossil fishes.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 45: See Agassiz, _Poiss. Foss._, tom. ii. Part 2, p. 89 _et\r\nseq._]\r\n\r\nThe word _holoptychius_ means, as I have said, \"wrinkled or folded\r\nall over,\"--a name truly expressive of the peculiar style of ornament\r\ndisplayed by every part of the exterior of the animal's body. The\r\nhead-plates, which are of great size, exhibit a fine corrugated\r\nshagreen-like surface, roughened into knobs, and wavy lines of\r\nconfluent tubercules, that remind one disposed to be fanciful, of a\r\nfrosty December moon with its isolated peaks, and confluent mountain\r\nchains. The scales are of a rounded or oval form, and vary from less\r\nthan half an inch to fully four or even five inches in diameter.\r\nTheir upper side consists of two parts, one of which with a crescent\r\nshape lay beneath, the over-lapping scales, while the other passed\r\noutwards to form a portion of the outer visible surface. The part\r\nthat was hidden by the overlapping scale was smooth, with a finely\r\nstriated surface. The exposed portion displayed the usual corrugated\r\nsculpturing, many of the little tubercules having striated sides, and\r\nshowing, in consequence, no little resemblance to the star-like knobs\r\non the dermal covering of the Old Red Sandstone asterolepis. The inner\r\nsurface of the scales was concave, with a central prominent oblong\r\npoint surrounded by encircling scaly ridges, and forming what is called\r\nthe centre of ossification.[46]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 46: The above descriptions of the scales and teeth of these\r\ntwo fishes, are taken from specimens in my own collection. None of my\r\nholoptychian scales show incontestable the proportion of the covered to\r\nthe exposed part. Judging from the aspect of one of them, the wrinkled\r\nportion occupied perhaps about three-fifths of the entire scale,\r\nthe remaining part being covered by the overlapping edges of those\r\nadjacent; for the characteristic corrugated surface was essentially\r\nan external ornament, and ceased at the point where the external\r\nbone passed into the interior. I may remark, that the upper side of\r\nthe scales is not very frequently seen in the Burdiehouse limestone,\r\nthe rough surface usually adhering to the rock, and leaving only the\r\nsmooth inner side exposed. Out of seven specimens from that locality,\r\nonly one shows the upper side, and that by no means in a perfect state\r\nof keeping. The structure alike of scales and bones can be seen to\r\nmuch greater advantage in the shales, ironstones, and coals of the\r\ncoal-fields, where, owing to the soft nature of their matrix, the\r\nfossils can be readily cleared and exposed.]\r\n\r\nBut perhaps the most remarkable and characteristic parts of the\r\ncarboniferous holoptychius were its jaws and teeth. As we might\r\nreadily conjecture from the great size and strength of the scales and\r\ncranial plates of this fish, its dentition was of a correspondingly\r\nmassive type. The under jaw, with the usual corrugated ornament,\r\nfrequently exceeded a foot in length, and displayed along its upper\r\nedge a thick-set group of teeth. Of these there were two kinds one\r\nof a smaller size and more blunted form, with short indented furrows\r\nat their base; the other of a greatly more formidable size, grouped\r\nat intervals among the smaller ones. The front end of each under jaw\r\nbore one of these long conical tusks, serving as it were to guard the\r\nentrance of the mouth. Each of the larger teeth had a base strongly\r\nmarked with longitudinal furrows, and sank deep into the jaw, with\r\nthe bone of which it sometimes anchylosed.[47] The part of the tooth\r\nabove this socket had an oval form, so flattened as to present two\r\ncutting edges, one facing the front, the other the back of the mouth,\r\nand meeting at the upper end of the tooth which was sharp and pointed.\r\nSuch large conical tusks may frequently be obtained, having a length\r\nof two or three inches, while occasionally they range as high as six\r\nor seven, the smaller teeth seldom reaching so much as an inch. It\r\nis difficult to see how, with such a formidable dentition, the jaws\r\ncould readily close. In some specimens I have seen deep hollows beside\r\nthe bases of the teeth, which may possibly have received those of the\r\nopposite jaw, but the gigantic tusks at the entrance of the mouth seem\r\nto have stood high over the jaw, passing outside like those of the\r\nwild-boar. If this be correct, the jaw of the holoptychius would unite\r\nthe mechanism of both the alligator and the crocodile--its recipient\r\nhollows being analogous to the tooth-pits in the former tribe, and its\r\nprotruded teeth to the similarly exposed teeth of the latter.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 47: I have seen detached teeth, wherein the length of\r\nthe root, or part imbedded in the jaw, tripled that of the exposed\r\npart, sinking four or five inches into the bone without any trace of\r\nanchylosis. Whether these huge tusks belonged to the upper or under\r\nmaxillary, I do not pretend to say, though no specimen of the under\r\njaw, which has ever come under my notice, would accommodate half of\r\nsuch a deep-sunk base.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 31.--Jaw of Holoptychius (_Rhizodus_.--Owen) from\r\nGilmerton, one-fourth nat. size; the large teeth along the middle part\r\nof the jaw are here wanting.]\r\n\r\nWhen we bring the microscope to bear upon the elucidation of the\r\nstructure of these ancient teeth, it seems as if our labour had but\r\njust begun; and that so far from having by an external scrutiny\r\nexhausted all that they have to show us, our knowledge of them can be\r\nbut scanty and superficial until we have studied them carefully under\r\na magnifying power. Microscopic sections of such organic remains are\r\nprepared in the same way as those of the fossil woods already noticed;\r\nand a more interesting or beautiful series of objects cannot be\r\nconceived than a set of slices of these fossil-teeth.\r\n\r\nViewed, then, in longitudinal section from base to point, the part\r\nabove the fluted root of one of the large teeth of the holoptychius is\r\nseen to consist of minute hair-like fibres of extreme tenuity, which\r\nproceed in straight lines from the outer surface to the interior. At\r\nright angles to these, and parallel with the outer edges, there is\r\na set of dark widely-placed lines conforming to the outline of the\r\ntooth, like so many long sugar-loaf shaped caps, placed within each\r\nother. When this part is cut across, and viewed in transverse section,\r\nthe tooth is observed to be of a flattened oval form, with the same\r\nfine fibres or tubes radiating from the centre, and traversed by the\r\nsame dark bands which now assume the form of concentric rings. The\r\nappearance thus presented reminds one at once of a cross section\r\nof some dicotyledonous tree, the dark bands resembling the annual\r\nlayers of growth, and like these resulting from a similar thickening\r\nof the internal tissue. The upper part of the tooth is solid and the\r\nconcentric rings few; the middle exhibits an increase of the rings, and\r\npossesses, moreover, a hollow centre or pulp-cavity,[48] with the usual\r\ndiverging fibres. Here the oval form is well shown, and the encircling\r\nrings are considerably flattened at the ends of the long axis.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 48: This hollow centre may be seen occasionally filled up by\r\na sharp conical tooth like the _phragmocone_ of a belemnite.]\r\n\r\nThe lower portion of the tooth exhibits a much more complicated\r\ntexture. Externally it is marked by deep longitudinal furrows, that\r\nrun down the enamelled sides and sink into the jaw. When cut across\r\nat this ribbed part, the tooth is found to present the most complex\r\nand graceful internal structure. The prominent ridges between the\r\nfurrows are seen to be produced by crumpled folds of the substance of\r\nthe tooth, which roll inwards towards the centre, coalescing with each\r\nother, and forming intricate groups of circling knots and folds. In\r\nsome places they seem all but separated from each other into little\r\ncircles, pierced with a central aperture, and recall the aspect of\r\nthe upper layer in the scale of megalichthys. Each of these loops and\r\nfolds presents a texture exactly similar to that of the upper part of\r\nthe tooth. The same minute hair-like tubes, darkened and thickened in\r\nthe long axis, radiate towards the centre; the same concentric bands\r\nrun from centre to circumference; so that the lower part of the tooth\r\nseems, as it were, made up of a bundle of smaller teeth partially\r\nmelted into each other. Between these loops and folds circular meshes\r\nfrequently occur, and add to the complexity as well as the beauty of\r\nthe whole structure. One of these sections, with all its twisting\r\ncrumples, and folds, and knots, and coloured meshes, and encircled\r\nrings, bears no small resemblance to an antique polished table that\r\nhas been cut out of the gnarled roots of a venerable oak. This complex\r\nstructure arose from the mode of growth of the tooth; each prominent\r\nexternal ridge continually turning inwards down the furrow on either\r\nside, and mingling in freakish knots with the folds that had gone\r\nbefore.[49]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 49: For an acquaintance with the remarkable teeth of this\r\nancient fish, more minute than it had been my good fortune to possess\r\nbefore, I am indebted to a most interesting series of microscopical\r\npreparations kindly lent me from his extensive collection by my friend\r\nMr. Alexander Bryson of Edinburgh.]\r\n\r\nThe internal bones of the holoptychius were of great size and strength,\r\nas befitted such a bulky ganoid. Some of them had a singular style of\r\nsurface ornament, that somewhat resembled a frosted widow on a December\r\nmorning. Their internal structure was loose and cancellated; the endo-\r\nbeing usually of a less compact texture than the exo-skeleton. Judging\r\nfrom the size of such bones, the carboniferous holoptychius must have\r\nbeen one of the bulkiest and most formidable denizens of the deep,\r\nreaching sometimes to a length of twenty feet or even more. Such an\r\nanimal would have been, perhaps, quite a match for our hugest crocodile\r\nor alligator, for it must have swum about with a litheness and agility\r\npossessed by none of the saurian reptiles. Like that leviathan chosen\r\nby the Almighty, in an age long subsequent, as an illustration of His\r\npower and greatness, the holoptychius must have been king over all\r\nthe inhabitants of the sea, and the magnificent language of Job,\r\ndescriptive of the living animal, applies not less graphically to\r\nthe extinct one: \"Who can open the doors of his face? his teeth are\r\nterrible round about. His scales are his pride, shut up together as\r\nwith a close seal. One is so near to another, that no air can come\r\nbetween them. He maketh the deep to boil like a pot: he maketh the sea\r\nlike a pot of ointment. He maketh a path to shine after him; one would\r\nthink the deep to be hoary.\"\r\n\r\nOur survey has hitherto been directed to the denizens of carboniferous\r\nlake, river, and sea, and we have found them to be alike important in\r\nnumbers and interesting in organization. It is otherwise, however,\r\nwhen we turn in search of the denizens of the carboniferous lands.\r\nThe crowded trees and shrubs of the coal strata recalling as they do\r\nold forest-covered swamps, might seem to indicate the probability of\r\na pretty numerous terrestrial fauna. Where are we to look for the\r\nfossilized relics of land animals, if not in the remains of a submerged\r\nland-surface? And yet, strange as it may seem, of the inhabitants of\r\nthe land during the Coal-measure period we know almost nothing. \"We\r\nhave ransacked hundreds of soils replete with the fossil roots of\r\ntrees,--have dug out hundreds of erect trunks and stumps, which stood\r\nin the position in which they grew,--have broken up myriads of cubic\r\nfeet of fuel, still retaining its vegetable structure,--and, after\r\nall, we continue almost as much in the dark regarding the invertebrate\r\nair-breathers of this epoch, as if the coal had been thrown down in\r\nmid-ocean.\"[50]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 50: Sir Charles Lyell's _Elements_, fifth edition, p. 406.]\r\n\r\nThe little land-shell already noticed as having been detected by Sir\r\nCharles Lyell in the carboniferous rocks of Nova Scotia, seems to be\r\nas yet the only air-breathing mollusc obtained from rocks of such\r\nhigh antiquity. Insect remains have been detected in the English\r\ncoal-fields belonging to two or three species of beetles; while on the\r\nContinent, wing-sheaths and other fragments of cockroaches, scorpions,\r\ngrasshoppers, locusts, crickets, &c., have been detected. But the most\r\nremarkable traces of air-breathers consist in various indications of\r\nthe existence of reptiles during the Carboniferous era. Fragmentary\r\nskeletons, with detached bones and plates, have been found in Bavaria\r\nand America, together with long tracks of footprints, from which it\r\nappears that during the time our coal-seams were forming, there swam\r\nthrough the sluggish deltas, or crept amid the dank luxuriant foliage,\r\nstrange lizard-like forms, large enough to leave behind them on the\r\nsoft yielding mud or sand the impress of their double pair of toed\r\nfeet. But of these animals we have much to learn. Some of them have\r\nbequeathed to us merely their dismembered broken bones; others have\r\nleft but the imprints of their toes. Yet even these remains, trifling\r\nas they may seem, become of importance when we remember that they\r\ndemonstrate fishes not to have been the highest types of being during\r\nthe epoch of the Coal, and show that while the bulky holoptychius held\r\nthe supremacy of the waters, lizard-like forms of a less formidable\r\ntype seem, so far as we know, to have ruled it over the land.\r\n\r\nIn fine, then, no one can glance at a list of the carboniferous fauna\r\nwithout perceiving either that the animated world of that ancient\r\nepoch must have had a very different proportioning from what now\r\nobtains, or that we have only a meagre and fragmentary record of it.\r\nThat the latter conclusion is the more philosophical will appear if we\r\nreflect upon the many chances that exist against the entombment and\r\npreservation of animal remains, especially of those peculiar to the\r\nland. How very small a proportion of the remains of animals living in\r\nour own country could be gathered from the surface-soil of any given\r\nlocality, and how very inadequate would be the meagre list of species\r\nthus obtained, as representing the varied and extensive fauna of Great\r\nBritain! In contrasting, then, the rich abundance of marine organisms\r\nwith the extreme paucity of terrestrial animals among the carboniferous\r\nrocks, it would be too hasty to infer a corresponding disproportion\r\noriginally. It must be admitted that the rarity of air-breathers,\r\nafter such long-continued and extensive explorations among terrestrial\r\nand lacustrine beds, presents a difficult problem, only (if at all)\r\nto be cleared away by patient and persevering investigation. With\r\nthis preliminary caution, we may regard the carboniferous fauna as\r\npeculiarly rich in marine species. The sea-bottoms swarmed with\r\nstone-lilies, cup-corals, and net-like bryozoa, mingled with the\r\nvarious tribes of molluscan life--the brachiopods with their long\r\nciliated arms; the bivalves and gastropods with their coloured shells\r\nthat recall some of the most familiar objects of our shores; and the\r\ncephalopods with their groups of siphonated chambers, straight as in\r\nthe orthoceras, or gracefully coiled as in the goniatite. The seas\r\nswarmed, too, with fishes belonging to the two great orders of ganoids\r\nand placoids, the latter represented now by our sharks and rays,\r\nthough the exact type of the ancient genera is retained only by the\r\ncestracion or Port-Jackson shark; the ganoids, with their strong armour\r\nof bone, represented by but two genera, the lepidosteus of the American\r\nrivers, and the polypterus of the Nile,--two fishes that seem but as\r\ndwarfs when placed side by side with the gigantic holoptychius of the\r\ncoal-measures. The rivers and estuaries of the same period seem to have\r\nbeen frequented by immense shoals of the smaller ganoidal fishes that\r\nfed on decaying matter brought down from the land, and perhaps, too,\r\non the minute Crustacea that lay strewed by myriads along the bottom.\r\nInto these busy scenes the bulkier monsters from the sea made frequent\r\nmigrations, perhaps in some cases ascending the rivers for leagues to\r\nspawn, and returning again to their places at the mouth of the estuary\r\nor in open sea. The rivers and lakes swarmed with small crustaceous\r\nanimals, and nourished, too, shells like those of our pearl-mussels.\r\nThe land--so luxuriantly clothed with vegetable forms--was hummed over\r\nby beetles, chirupped over by grasshoppers and crickets, and crawled\r\nover by four-footed reptiles, that united in their structure the lizard\r\nand the frog. But of the general grade and proportions of its denizens\r\nwe still remain in ignorance. From all that yet appears, the scenery\r\nof these forests must have been dark, silent, and gloomy, buried in a\r\nsolitude that was startled by no tiger's roar, no cattle's low, and\r\nneither cheered with the melody of birds nor gladdened by the presence\r\nof man.\r\n\r\nWe have lingered, perhaps, too long over the remains of these old\r\ncarboniferous animals. But the delay may be not without its use if, by\r\nthus bringing before us some of the more marked points in the structure\r\nof creatures that for ages peopled our planet, it broaden our view of\r\ncreation; and by lifting the curtain from off a dim, distant period of\r\nour world's long history, it show, amid all diversities of arrangement,\r\nand all varieties of form, still the same grand principles of design,\r\nand the same modes of working as those which we can see and compare\r\namong the living forms around us. It is something to be assured that\r\nthe race of man has been preceded by many other races, lower indeed\r\nin the scale of being, but manifesting, throughout the long centuries\r\nof their existence, ideas of mechanism and contrivance still familiar\r\nto us, and serving in this way to link the human era with those that\r\nhave gone before, as parts of one grand scheme carried on by one great\r\nCreator.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Sand and gravel of the boulder--What they suggested--Their\r\n       consideration leads us among the more mechanical operations\r\n       of Nature--An endless succession of mutations in the economy\r\n       of the universe--Exhibited in plants--In animals--In\r\n       the action of winds and oceanic currents--Beautifully\r\n       shown by the ceaseless passage of water from land to\r\n       sea, and sea to land--This interchange not an isolated\r\n       phenomenon--How aided in its effects by a universal process\r\n       of decay going on wherever a land surface is exposed to\r\n       the air--Complex mode of Nature's operations--Interlacing\r\n       of different causes in the production of an apparently\r\n       single and simple effect--Decay of rocks--Chemical\r\n       changes--Underground and surface decomposition--Carbonated\r\n       springs--The Spar Cave--Action of rain-water--Decay of\r\n       granite--Scene in Skye--Trap-dykes--Weathered cliffs of\r\n       sandstone--Of conglomerate--Of shale--Of limestone--Caverns\r\n       of Raasay--Incident--Causes of this waste of calcareous\r\n       rocks--Tombstones.\r\n\r\nFrom the blackened plants that darkened the upper layers of the\r\nboulder, the transition was natural to the matrix in which they lay.\r\nThe whole rock consisted of a fine quartzy sand more or less distinctly\r\nlaminated, and showing in its lower parts well-rounded pebbles of\r\nquartz, green grit, and felspathic trap. The contemplation of these\r\nfeatures suggested the existence of some old land with elevated ranges\r\nof hills, and wide verdant valleys traversed by rivulets and rivers\r\nwhich bore a ceaseless burden of mud, sand, and gravel, onwards to\r\nthe sea. The pebbles afforded some indication of the kind of rocks\r\nthat formed the hill-sides. Perhaps the higher grounds exhibited that\r\ngrey wrinkled appearance peculiar to the quartz districts of the\r\nnorth-western Highlands, with here and there a bluff crag of felspathic\r\ntrap shooting up from among the fern-brakes of the valley, or cutting\r\nacross the channel of some mountain stream that tumbled over the pale\r\nrock in a sheet of foam. And there may have been among these uplands\r\nsmooth undulating districts, dotted over with dark araucarian pines,\r\nand densely clothed with a brushwood of rolling fern, but which showed\r\nin all their ravines the green grit that formed the framework of the\r\ncountry,--its beds twisted and contorted, jointed and cleaved, like\r\nthe grits and slates along the banks of many a stream, beloved by\r\nthe angler, in the classic ground of the Ettrick and the Yarrow. But\r\nwhatever may have been the special features of its scenery, there can\r\nbe no doubt of the land's existence. The carbonized plants stand up to\r\ntell us of its strange and luxuriant vegetation. We have listened to\r\ntheir story, and suffered them to lead us away into forest, and lake,\r\nand sea, to look on the various forms of life, vegetable and animal,\r\nwhich abounded in that far-distant age. We return again to the boulder,\r\nand shall now seek to learn the lessons which the sand and pebbles have\r\nto teach us. Their subject belongs to what is called physical geology,\r\nand will bring before us some of the more mechanical operations of\r\nnature, such as the slow but constant action of air, rain, and rivers,\r\nupon hard rock, the grinding action of the waves, and the consequent\r\naccumulation of new masses of sedimentary rock.\r\n\r\nIn all the departments of nature that come under the cognizance of man,\r\nthere is seen to be an endless succession of mutations. According to\r\nthe Samian philosopher--\r\n\r\n    \"Turn wheresoe'er we may by land or sea,\r\n    There's nought around us that doth cease to be.\r\n    Each object varies but in form and hue,\r\n    Its parts exchange; hence combinations new.\r\n    And thus is Nature through her mighty frame\r\n    For ever varying, and yet still the same.\"\r\n\r\nIn the world of life we see how animals are sustained by a constant\r\nseries of chemical changes in their blood, every respiration of air\r\nadding, as it were, fresh fuel to the flame of life within. In plants,\r\ntoo, there is an analogous process. The atmospheric air is by them\r\ndecomposed, part of it being given off again, and part retained to\r\nbuild up the organic structure. Plants withdraw mineral matter from the\r\nsoil, animals feed upon plants, and thus the earthy substances, after\r\nhaving formed a part, first of rock masses, then of vegetable, and\r\nsubsequently of animal organizations, are returned again to the soil,\r\nwhence to be once more withdrawn and undergo new cycles of mutation.\r\nBut this perpetual interchange is not confined to the vital world. We\r\nsee it in the action of winds, when heated air rises and moves in one\r\ndirection, and the colder parts sink and travel the opposite way. The\r\nsame principle is exhibited by the oceanic currents, the removal of a\r\nbody of water, from whatever cause, always necessitating the ingress of\r\na corresponding quantity to supply its place. But perhaps one of the\r\nmost beautiful instances of these interchanges in the whole inorganic\r\nworld is the ceaseless passage of water from the land to the sea, and\r\nfrom the sea to the land. The countless thousands of rivulets, and\r\nstreams, and gigantic rivers, that are ever pouring their waters into\r\nthe great deep, do not in the least raise its level or diminish its\r\nsaltness. And why? Simply because the sea gives off by evaporation\r\nas much water as it receives from rain and rivers. The vapour thus\r\nexhaled ascends to the upper regions of the atmosphere, where it forms\r\nclouds, and whence it eventually descends as rain. The larger part of\r\nthe rain probably falls upon the ocean, but a considerable amount is\r\nnevertheless driven by winds across the land. This finds its way into\r\nthe streams, and so back again to the sea, only, however, to be anew\r\nevaporated and sent as drizzling rain across the face of land and sea.\r\nThis interchange is constantly in progress, and seems to have been as\r\nunvarying during past ages.\r\n\r\nBut the ceaseless passage of water between land and sea is not a mere\r\nisolated and independent phenomenon. Like all the rest of Nature's\r\nprocesses, even the simplest, it produces important and complicated\r\neffects. And the reader may, perhaps, think it worth looking at for a\r\nlittle, when he reflects that to this seemingly feeble cause we owe no\r\nsmall part of our solid lands, whether as islands wasted by the sea,\r\nor as part of vast and variegated continents, wide rolling prairies\r\ncovered with verdure and roamed over by herds of cattle, or wintry\r\nAlpine hills lifeless and bare.\r\n\r\nThe truth of this will appear when we reflect that the moisture which\r\nrises from the sea and falls on the land as rain, is free from any\r\nadmixture of impurities; but by the time it again reaches the sea,\r\nafter a circuit of perhaps many miles down valley and plain, it has\r\ngrown turbid and discoloured, carrying with it a quantity of mud, sand,\r\nand drift-wood. The sediment thus transported soon sinks to the bottom,\r\nwhere it eventually hardens into rock, and in course of time is raised\r\nabove the waves as part of a new land. Such I conceive to have been the\r\norigin of the sand, gravel, and imbedded plants of our boulder. It may\r\nbe well, however, in going into the details of the subject, to take a\r\nwider view of this interesting branch of geology, and look for a little\r\nat the forms and modes of the decomposition of rocks, and the varied\r\nmanner in which new sedimentary accumulations are formed.\r\n\r\nAll over the world, wherever a land surface spreads out beneath the\r\nsky, there goes on a process of degradation and decay. Hills are\r\ninsensibly crumbling into the valleys, valleys are silently eroded,\r\nand crags that ever since the birth of man have been the landmarks of\r\nthe race, are yet slowly but surely melting away. It matters not where\r\nthe hill or plain may lie, the highest mountains of the tropics and\r\nthe frozen soil of the poles, yield each in its measure and degree\r\nto the influence of the general law. It might seem that so universal\r\na process should be the result of some equally prevalent and simple\r\ncause. But when we set ourselves to examine the matter, we find it far\r\notherwise. The waste of the solid lands, in place of arising from some\r\nsingle general action, is found to result from a multiform chain of\r\ncauses, often local in their operation and variable in their effects.\r\nSuch an investigation affords a good illustration of the general mode\r\nand fashion in which Nature delights to work. It shows us that what\r\nmay seem a very simple process may be in reality a very complicated\r\none; that in truth there exist in the world around us few if any\r\nsimple, single processes, which stand out by themselves unconnected\r\nwith any other; that, on the contrary, all become intimately linked\r\ntogether, the effects of one often forming part of the chain of causes\r\nin another, and producing by their combined action that complex yet\r\nstrikingly harmonious order that pervades all the operations of Nature.\r\nTo an extent of which Cicero never dreamed, there runs through all\r\nthe world \"such an admirable succession of things that each seems\r\nentwined with the other, and all are thus intimately linked and bound\r\ntogether.\"[51] Man separates out these various processes, classifies\r\nand arranges them, because from the imperfection of his mental powers\r\nhe cannot otherwise understand their effects; all would seem but\r\nchaos and confusion. But the formal precision and the sharp lines of\r\ndemarcation exist only in his mind. They have no place in the outer\r\nworld. There we see process dove-tailing with process, and spreading\r\nout over the material world in an endless network of cause and effect.\r\nWe feebly try to trace out these interlacing threads, but we can follow\r\nthem far in no direction. Proteus-like, they seem to change their\r\naspect, blending now into one form, now into another, and so eluding\r\nour keenest pursuit.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 51: Cicero, _De Nat. Deor._ lib. i. 4. So, in Bacon's _Wisdom\r\nof the Ancients_, under the fable \"Pan or Nature:\"--\"The chain of\r\nnatural causes links together the rise, duration, and corruption; the\r\nexaltation, degeneration, and workings; the processes, the effects,\r\nand changes, of all that can any way happen to things.\" Such is the\r\nphilosopher's explanation of the Destinies as sisters of Pan. In no\r\npart of his writings can the thorough practical character of Bacon's\r\nphilosophy be more conspicuously seen than in his treatment of these\r\nancient fables. Glancing over the titles of the different papers, you\r\nare tempted to wonder what an intellect which could only appreciate\r\npoetry as a mode of narrating history or as a vehicle for the teaching\r\nof truth, will make of such fairy tales as those of Pan, Orpheus,\r\nProteus, Cupid, and many others. They seem like so many airy Naiads\r\ncrushed within the iron grasp of a hundred-banded Briareus. But a\r\nperusal of those delightful pages will show that the giant has really\r\nno malevolent intentions towards his fair prisoners; nay, that he only\r\nwishes, by stripping them of their paint and finery, to show that,\r\nwith all their lightness and grace, they are nevertheless strong buxom\r\ndames, of the same doughty race with himself.]\r\n\r\nAs an instance, therefore, of this remarkable interlacing of different\r\ncauses in what we call a single process, the disintegration of rocks\r\ndeserves our attention. In ordinary language, we say a stone rots\r\naway, and its debris is washed down by the rains and streamlets, and\r\nthe process does not at first sight seem at all more complex than the\r\nexpression used to describe it; yet if we examine the subject, we shall\r\nere long find that there are in nature many simpler things than the\r\nrotting away of a stone. To effect such a result, there come into play\r\na whole category of agencies, chemical and mechanical, so combined in\r\ntheir operation, and so intimately blended in their effects, that it\r\nbecomes no easy task to tell where one set ends and another begins.\r\n\r\nA rock is said to undergo a chemical change, when one or more of its\r\ncomponent parts passes from one state of combination to another--as,\r\nfor instance, when a mineral absorbs oxygen, and, from the condition\r\nof a protoxide, changes into that of a peroxide; or when, parting with\r\nits silicic acid, it takes an equivalent amount of carbonic acid, and\r\nin place of a silicate becomes a carbonate. Now these, and similar\r\nmetamorphisms, are chiefly produced by water permeating through the\r\nrocky mass, and thus no sooner does the old combination cease, than the\r\nnew one which replaces it is dissolved by the slowly filtering water,\r\nand carried away either to greater depths, or to the surface. Every\r\ndrop of water, therefore, that finds its way through the rock, carries\r\naway an infinitesimal portion of the mineral matter, and the stone is\r\nconsequently undergoing a continual decay. This condition of things may\r\ngo on either at some depth in the earth's crust, or on the surface.\r\nIn the former case, springs and percolating water are the agents in\r\neffecting the change; in the latter, it is produced chiefly by rain and\r\nstreams. But wherever the process goes on, the results, unless where\r\ncounteracted by some opposite agency, are ultimately the same. It may\r\nbe of use to look at some examples of these changes, and, by dividing\r\nthem in a rough way, into underground and surface actions, we shall be\r\nenabled to mark more clearly their effects.\r\n\r\nA common source of the decay of rocks arises from the percolation\r\nthrough them of water charged with carbonic acid. Decomposing\r\nvegetation gives off a large amount of this gas, which is readily\r\nabsorbed by rain-water. The water sinks into the ground filtering\r\nthrough cracks and fissures in the rocks, whence it afterwards\r\nre-emerges in the form of springs. Now wherever, in its passage through\r\nthese subterranean rocks, the water meets with any carbonate, the\r\ncarbonic acid contained in the liquid immediately begins to dissolve\r\nout the mineral matter, and carries it eventually to the surface. There\r\nthe amount of evaporation is often sufficient to cause a re-deposit of\r\nthe mineral in solution. If it be lime, a white crust gathers along\r\nthe sides of the stream, delicately enveloping grass-stalks, leaves,\r\ntwigs, snail-shells, and other objects, which it may meet with in its\r\nprogress. Such \"petrifying\" springs, as they are popularly termed,\r\noccur abundantly in our limestone districts. It should be borne in\r\nmind, however, that they only produce an incrustation round the organic\r\nnucleus, and do not petrify it. That alone is a true petrifaction\r\nwhere the substance is literally fossilized, or turned into stone.\r\nA familiar instance of a similar chemical process may be seen under\r\nmany a bridge, and along the vaulted roofs of many an old castle.\r\nNumerous tapering stalactites hang down from between the joints of the\r\nmasonry, resembling, so to speak, icicles of stone, often of a dazzling\r\nwhiteness. They are formed by the percolation of carbonated water\r\nthrough the mortar of the joints, the carbonate of lime thus withdrawn\r\nbeing re-deposited where the water reaches the air and evaporates. A\r\nlittle pellicle of lime first gathers on the roof, and every succeeding\r\ndrop adds to the length of the column. In some cases, where the supply\r\nof water is too great for the amount of evaporation, part falls on the\r\nfloor, and, being there dissipated, leaves behind a slowly-gathering\r\npile of lime called stalagmite. In some of the Eastern grottos, the\r\npillars from the roof have become united to those on the floor, forming\r\nthe most exquisite and fairy-like combinations of arch and pillar.\r\nAn example of a calcareous grotto has now become pretty familiar to\r\nour summer tourists, under the name of the Spar Cave. It lies on an\r\nexposed cliff-line along the western shores of Skye, against which\r\nthe surge of the Atlantic is ever breaking. You approach it from the\r\nsea, and enter a narrow recess between two precipitous walls of rock,\r\nopen above to the sky, and washed below by the gurgling tide. Crossing\r\nthe narrow, shingly beach, you find the ground thickly covered with\r\nherbage, while, grouped along the dark walls, are large bunches of\r\nspleenwort, hart's-tongue fern, and other plants that love the shade.\r\nSoon after entering the cave, all becomes sombre and cold; and the few\r\ncandles, with which the party have furnished themselves, only serve\r\nto heighten the gloom. After scrambling on for a time across dank,\r\ndripping rocks, and over a high bank of smooth marble, on which it is\r\ndifficult to creep, almost impossible to stand, you arrive at a deep\r\npool of clear, limpid water, which extends across the cave from side to\r\nside, barring all farther passage. The scenery at this point will not\r\nreadily be forgotten. The roof towers so high that the lights are too\r\nfeeble to show it, while the walls, roughened into every form of cusp\r\nand pinnacle, pillar and cornice, all glittering in the light, resemble\r\nthe grotto of some fairy dream. On returning again to the light of day,\r\nif you ask the cause that has given rise to all this beauty, it will\r\nbe found a very simple one. The cleft occupied by the cave has been\r\nonce filled by a wall of igneous rock called a trap-dyke. Atmospheric\r\ninfluences, aided probably by the waves, have caused the decomposition\r\nand removal of this intruded rock, and the calcareous sandstone on\r\neither side 'now stands up in a wall-like form. The upper part of\r\nthe dyke remains as a roof to the cave, but it has become completely\r\ncovered over with the calcareous deposits left by the carbonated water\r\nthat filters through the adjacent limy sandstone. The amount of water\r\nis considerable, and consequently every part of the cavern--roof,\r\nwalls, and floor--has been incrusted with a white crystalline carbonate\r\nof lime. In volcanic countries, where the springs often come to the\r\nSurface in a highly heated state, charged, too, with various chemical\r\ningredients, they produce no slight amount of physical change on the\r\nsurrounding districts, and must be regarded as important geological\r\nagents.\r\n\r\nBut perhaps the most common and widely-diffused form of decomposition,\r\nis that produced on the surface of the earth by the action of\r\nrain-water, in slowly dissolving out the soluble parts of rocks, and\r\nwashing away the loose, incoherent grains that remain behind. It is\r\nhard to say whether this process is more chemical or mechanical.\r\nThe solution of the mineral matter belongs to the former class of\r\nchanges, while the removal of debris must be ranked among the latter.\r\nThe results of these combined forces form one of the most important\r\nbranches of investigation which can occupy the attention of the\r\nphysical geologist, and in contemplating them, we are at a loss whether\r\nmost to admire their magnitude, or the immense lapse of time which\r\nthey must have occupied. It may be worth while to look at the progress\r\nof this kind of disintegration, that we may see how wide-spread and\r\nconstant is the waste that goes on over the world, and how materially\r\nthe effects of running water are by this means increased. A volume\r\nmight be written about the decay of rocks, and a most interesting one\r\nit would be, but its authorship would devolve rather on the chemist\r\nthan the geologist.[52] We can do no more here than merely glance at\r\none or two illustrative examples.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 52: A German chemist, Bischoff by name, has written two\r\nlearned volumes in which this subject is discussed (translated into\r\nEnglish, and published by the Cavendish Society), valuable for their\r\nfacts, but not always very safe in their deductions.]\r\n\r\nAmong the mineral substances that most readily yield to the action of\r\nthe weather, are the silicates and the carbonates. The rocks containing\r\nthe former belong in large measure to what we call the igneous class,\r\nsuch as the granites and traps; while those containing the latter\r\nform the bulk of our useful stones, such as limestone and sandstone.\r\nThe removal of alkaline silicates is due to their conversion into\r\ncarbonates, which are readily soluble in water. Rain falling on a rock\r\nin which they are largely present, dissolves a small portion, and\r\ncarries it into the soil or into streams, and thence to the ocean.\r\nEvery shower in this way withdraws a minute amount of mineral matter,\r\nand tends to leave the harder insoluble grains of the rock standing out\r\non the surface in the form of a loose pulverulent crust, easily washed\r\naway. The debris thus formed, where allowed to accumulate, makes an\r\nexcellent kind of soil known to the Scottish farmers as \"rotten rock.\"\r\n\r\nThe tourist who has visited any of our granitic districts, such as the\r\nsouth-western parts of Cornwall, the rugged scenery of Arran, or the\r\nhills of the Aberdeenshire Highlands, must be familiar with some of the\r\nforms of waste which the rocks of these regions display. Mouldering\r\nblocks, poised sometimes on but a slender base, and eaten away into the\r\nmost fantastic shapes, abound in some localities, while in other parts,\r\nas for instance at the summit of Goatfell in Arran, the rock weathers\r\ninto a sort of rude masonry, and stands out in its nakedness and ruin\r\nlike some crumbling relic of Cyclopean art. In other districts, as in\r\nSkye and in the adjoining island of Raasay, the granitic hills are\r\nof a still more mouldering material. Their summits, white and bald,\r\nsometimes rise to a height of fully two thousand feet above the sea,\r\nwhile down their sides are spread long reddish-yellow tracks of debris\r\nintermingled with patches of stunted herbage. Every winter adds to the\r\nwaste, and lengthens the lines of rubbish. Some of these hills form a\r\ngood field wherein to study the disintegration of granitic rocks, such,\r\nfor instance, as Beinn na Cailleaich, that rises from the shores of\r\nBroadford Bay. Around the eastern base of that mountain there stretches\r\na flat moory district, with a few protruding blocks that have rolled\r\ndown into the plain. The earlier part of the ascent lies over a region\r\nof metamorphic limestone, where the grey weathered masses of the\r\ncalcareous rock, often like groups of mouldering tombstones, are seen\r\nprotruding in considerable numbers through the rich soft grass and the\r\nscanty brushwood of hazel and fern. Leaving this more verdant zone, we\r\nenter a district of brown heath that slowly grows in desolation as we\r\nascend. Huge blocks of syenite--a granitic rock of which the upper part\r\nof the mountain entirely consists--cumber the soil in every direction,\r\nand gradually increase in numbers till the furze can scarcely find a\r\nnestling-place, and is at last choked altogether. Then comes a scene\r\nof utter desolation. Grey masses of rock of every form and size are\r\npiled upon each other in endless confusion. Some of them lie buried in\r\ndebris, others tower above each other in a rude sort of masonry, while\r\nnot a few perched on the merest point seem but to await the storms of\r\nanother winter to hurl them down into the plain. The ascent of such a\r\nregion is no easy task, and must not unfrequently be performed on hands\r\nand knees. But once at the top, the view is enough to compensate a\r\ntenfold greater exertion. Far away to the west, half sunk in the ocean,\r\nlie the isles of Eigg, Coll, and Tiree, with the nearer mountains of\r\nRum. North-west, are the black serrated peaks of the Coolins, that\r\nstand out by themselves in strange contrast with every other feature\r\nof the landscape. Northward, stretches the great range of syenitic\r\nhills, with the sea and the northern Hebrides beyond. Away to the east,\r\nacross the intervening strait, lie the hills of the mainland, with\r\nall their variety of form and outline, and all their changing tints,\r\nas the chequered light and shade glide athwart the scene. Southward,\r\nthe eye rests on the grey wrinkled hills of Sleat, and far over along\r\nthe line where earth and sky commingle, are the mountains of Morven,\r\nstretching westwards till they end in the bold weather-beaten headland\r\nof Ardnamurchan, beyond which lies the blue boundless ocean. The top of\r\nBeinn na Cailleaich is flat and smooth, surmounted in the centre by a\r\ncairn. Tradition tells that beneath these stones there rest the bones\r\nof the nurse of a Norwegian princess. She had accompanied her mistress\r\nto \"the misty hills of Skye,\" and eventually died there. But the love\r\nof home continued strong with her to the end, for it was her last\r\nrequest that she might be buried on the top of Beinn na Cailleaich,\r\nthat the clear northern breezes, coming fresh from the land of her\r\nchildhood, might blow over her grave.\r\n\r\nI have already alluded to the wasting away of a trap-dyke. This\r\ndecomposition arises from the same cause as among the granites--the\r\nsolution, and removal of the silicates. All these trap-rocks are\r\nigneous, and seem to have risen from below through open fissures and\r\nrents. As they contain a large percentage of felspar--the same mineral\r\nthat gives to many granites their mouldering character--they may be\r\nseen exhibiting every form and stage of decay. Often they stand out in\r\nprominent relief from some cliff of soft shale, with a brown surface,\r\npicturesquely roughened into spherical masses of all sizes, that give\r\nto the rock somewhat the appearance of a hardened pile of ammunition\r\nin which ponderous shells lie intermingled with round shot, grape, and\r\ncanister. Each of the concretionary balls when examined is found to\r\nexfoliate in concentric pellicles like the coats of an onion, and you\r\nmay sometimes peal off a considerable number before arriving at the\r\ncentral core, which consists of the hard rock still undecomposed. In\r\nthis case the process of degradation is aided by the decay of another\r\nmineral called augite, which contains a variable percentage of iron,\r\nand imparts the peculiar yellowish-brown tint to the weathered rock.\r\nTrap-dykes may also be seen in a still more wasted condition, where,\r\nin place of protruding from a cliff-line, they recede to some depth\r\nand give rise to deep clefts and fissures. An instance of this kind\r\nhas been referred to in the case of the Spar Cave, and many others may\r\nbe seen along the same coast-line. The shore there for miles is formed\r\nof a low cliff of white calcareous sandstone, fissured by innumerable\r\nperpendicular clefts of greater or less width, and sometimes only a\r\nyard or two apart. Each of these has once been filled by a dyke of\r\ntrap, which originally rose up in a melted state, and after having\r\nsolidified into a compact stony mass, began to yield to the process of\r\ndecay. In all these and similar cases, the primary cause of the waste\r\nlies in the decomposition of the felspar. Rain-water acts in removing\r\nthe soluble portions, and the harder grains that remain, deprived of\r\nthe cementing matrix, ere long crumble down and are washed off by the\r\nrains. In this way the rock insensibly moulders away, every frost\r\nloosening its structure, and every shower carrying away part of its\r\nsubstance.\r\n\r\nAmong the many objects of interest along a rocky coast some of the more\r\nstriking are certainly to be found in the curious and often grotesque\r\nforms assumed by the weathered cliffs. Above high-water mark and thus\r\naway from the dash of the waves, we can often trace the progress of\r\ndecay among such sedimentary rocks as sandstones and conglomerates.\r\nWorn into holes and scars, projecting cusps and tapering pinnacles, or\r\neaten away into the rude semblance of a human form, headless perchance,\r\nor into the shape of a huge table poised on a narrow pedestal, the\r\nrock affords an endless variety of aspects and a continual source of\r\npleasure. If we chance to light upon any building constructed out of\r\nthe sandstone of such cliffs, it is worth noting that the removal of\r\nthe stone has not deprived it of its mouldering qualities; nay, that\r\nhouses erected within the memory of people still living already begin\r\nto wear an aspect of venerable antiquity. I remember meeting with an\r\ninteresting example in the case of an old castle built on a similar\r\nrocky coast-line. It stood on a little ness or promontory of dull red\r\nstone, washed on all sides save one by the wild sea. The walls, of\r\nwhich but a fragment remained, were built of a dark red sandstone; but\r\nthe lapse of centuries had told sadly on their masonry. The stones\r\nrose over each other tier upon tier, corroded sometimes into holes\r\nand hollows, sometimes into a close honey-combed surface, but the\r\nmortar that had been used to cement them together still stood firm and\r\nprotruded from between the tiers to show, by no doubtful or ambiguous\r\nsign, how silently yet how surely the wasting forces had been at\r\nwork. The scutcheon over the only remaining gateway had been carved\r\nout of another kind of stone of a lighter colour and harder texture,\r\nand so its grim lions looked nearly as fresh and formidable as when\r\nfirst raised to the place of honour which they still occupied. In\r\nthis case, as before, the decomposition was owing to the presence of\r\na considerable proportion of soluble matter, which the rains of four\r\ncenturies had carried away along with the loosened incoherent sandy\r\ngrains.\r\n\r\nConglomerate or pudding-stone has often a picturesque outline in its\r\ndecay, more especially if its included fragments have a considerable\r\nrange of size. Large tracts Of this rock exist in various parts of\r\nBritain, particularly in Scotland, where the basement beds of the Old\r\nRed Sandstone consist of a coarse conglomerate, sometimes several\r\nthousand feet in thickness. Such enormous masses form the scenery of a\r\nlarge part of East Lothian, and are found in detached patches across\r\ninto Peeblesshire and Lanark. In the north, too, the neighbourhood of\r\nInverness and other parts of the same district display conspicuous\r\nconglomerate hills. Unless where laid bare by streams or by the action\r\nof breakers, the contour of these hills is rounded and tame, with a\r\nscanty covering of short scrubby grass and very few protruding bosses\r\nof rock. But where a mountain torrent has cut its way down the hill\r\nside, the ravine thus formed exhibits broken walls and pillars of\r\nrock made up of rounded balls of every shade and size, cemented by a\r\ndark-red or green paste. The cementing material is sometimes clay,\r\nsometimes lime, and its variable nature gives rise to a corresponding\r\ninequality in the amount and form of decomposition. Where the rounded\r\npebbles are bound together by clay, rains act with rapidity in washing\r\naway the cement, and the component balls fall out by degrees, leaving\r\na cliff strangely roughened by protruding knobs, and eaten away into\r\nclefts and hollows. When the pebbles are held in a crystallized matrix\r\nof lime, they usually remain longer together, and may sometimes be\r\nseen standing up in the form of detached rugged pillars that defy\r\nall regularity of size or outline, and remind one of a sort of rude\r\ngrotto-work. Such irregularities become still more marked where to the\r\naction of the rains there has been added the spray of the ocean. A\r\ncoast-line of conglomerate, where the rock rises into cliffs, is always\r\na romantic one; caves, pillars, and ruined walls, all in the same rough\r\ngrotto style, meet us at every step. Here, too, we can mark the varying\r\neffect of the waves upon the lower portions of the rock, eating it into\r\ncavernous holes and leaving rugged projecting pinnacles to which the\r\nmottled colours of the included pebbles give an additional and peculiar\r\neffect.\r\n\r\nA cliff of shale seldom shows much of the picturesque, though often a\r\ngood deal of the ruinous. The rock is easily undermined by streams,\r\nand a shale ravine usually exhibits in consequence either heaps of\r\ncrumbling rubbish, or, where the stream comes past with a more rapid\r\ncurrent, perpendicular walls, jointed and laminated, but without much\r\nvariety of outline. Such cliffs, however, merit the careful attention\r\nof the observer, for from their friability they are most easily\r\ndecomposed and washed down by streams, to form new accumulations of\r\nsimilar soft argillaceous matter. A shale coast-line sometimes shows\r\ncliffs of considerable altitude, as in some parts of Skye and Pabba,\r\nwhere the Lias shales may be seen piled over each other often to a\r\nheight of seventy or eighty feet, and spreading out along the shore as\r\nlow flat reefs and skerries, brown with algæ at their seaward ends,\r\nand showing on the higher slopes of the beach the characteristic\r\nfossils of the Lias--_ammonites_, _belemnites_, and _gryphææ_--crowded\r\ntogether by hundreds. The action of the decomposing forces has operated\r\nmore effectually on the soft material of the shale than on the hard\r\ncrystalline lime of the included shells, so that the latter stand out\r\nin relief from the dull-brown surface of the rock, and from their\r\nnumbers and prominence form one of the most marked features of the\r\ncoast-line.\r\n\r\nProbably few have ever visited a limestone district without marking\r\nthe manner in which that rock yields to the action of the elements,\r\nwhether in an inland part of the country where rivers have cut deep\r\ngullies through the rock, or along some exposed shore where the stone\r\nhas been wasted by a still ruder assailant. An exposed cliff of hard\r\nhomogeneous limestone weathers into deep clefts and holes; the entire\r\nsurface assumes a pitted appearance, somewhat like a sandy beach after\r\na showier of rain, and the planes of stratification, or lines formed\r\nby the parallel junction of the beds are often worn away until the\r\nrock looks not unlike a piece of old masonry, in which the mortar has\r\ndecayed and dropped out, leaving the angles of the stones to get wasted\r\nand rounded by the action of the weather. In many districts, too, where\r\nthe rock is richly fossiliferous, the broken joints of encrinites along\r\nwith corals and shells may be seen crowded together by myriads, their\r\nhard skeletons protruding from the wasted rock in such a way as to show\r\nthat the stone can contain very little else. By this means we often\r\nlearn that a limestone bed is nothing but an old sea-bottom, where\r\nthe calcareous sediment was mainly derived from broken stone-lilies,\r\ncorals, and shells, though if we break off a piece of the rock the\r\ninternal fracture may show very little or no trace of any organic\r\nstructure. And hence if the geologist would form an accurate conception\r\nof the origin and structure of many of the stratified rocks, he must\r\nstudy them not in hand specimens neatly trimmed and arranged along the\r\nshelves and drawers of a cabinet, nor even in the ponderous blocks\r\ndaily exhumed by the quarryman, but along some surf-beaten cliff-line\r\nor down some precipitous ravine where the rock for centuries has been\r\nexposed to the wear and tear of the elements.\r\n\r\nLimestones and other calcareous formations are liable to more than\r\nordinary decay, for, as we have seen above, percolating rain-water\r\nconstantly carries away mineral matter from their subterranean\r\nportions. Accordingly, in some parts of the country, as for instance in\r\nYorkshire, the interior of such rocks has been eaten away into great\r\ncaverns by this form of decomposition.\r\n\r\nSome remarkable examples occur in the island of Raasay, one of the\r\nnorth-eastern Hebrides. Its eastern margin shoots up from the sea to a\r\nheight of over 900 feet, the cliff-line being formed of a calcareous\r\ngrit as perpendicular as a wall, and fissured by deep chasms and rents.\r\nThe narrow table-land between the edges of this cliff and an abrupt\r\nridge that rises behind, is perforated by innumerable holes and clefts,\r\ninto which if a stone be thrown it may be heard for several seconds\r\nrumbling far below. The edges of these pitfalls are often fringed\r\nwith ferns, rushes, and long grass, so as to be nearly hidden, and it\r\nrequires no little caution to traverse this elevated region in safety.\r\nInnumerable sheep have been lost by falling into the subterranean\r\nabysses, and even the wary natives seem to have sometimes lost their\r\nfooting. A story is told of a woman who had crossed to the other side\r\nof the island for the purchase of some commodities, and returning\r\nby the high grounds had got nearly within sight of her own cottage,\r\nwhen by some unlucky accident she took a false step and instantly\r\ndisappeared. Unfortunately her errand had been performed alone, so that\r\nsome time elapsed ere she was missed. The search continued unremitting\r\nfor two days, but no trace of the missing traveller could be found. At\r\nlast on the third day her figure was seen creeping slowly along the\r\nroad not many hundred yards from her own door. It appeared that she had\r\nfirst slid down a sheer height of about fifty feet, when her further\r\npassage was intercepted by the sides of the fissure. During the earlier\r\npart of her confinement she strove hard to re-ascend the chasm, and it\r\nwas not until, the effort seeming fruitless, she had begun to resign\r\nherself to despair, that a glimmering of light from below induced her\r\nto attempt a descent. This proved no easy matter, and occupied many\r\nweary hours of labour and suspense; but at length she succeeded in\r\nworming herself to the bottom, and crawled out more dead than alive\r\nonly a little way from her home. There still stand perched on some of\r\nthese precipitous cliffs the remains of a few villages, the inhabitants\r\nof which were accustomed to tether their children to the soil, whence\r\none of the hamlets received in Gaelic the soubriquet of Tethertown.\r\nMany a valuable commodity disappeared by rolling over the cliff, and\r\nI have been assured that it was no unfrequent occurrence for a pot of\r\npotatoes capsized at the doorway to tumble down the slope and make no\r\nstop until safely esconced at the sea-bottom.\r\n\r\nThe process whereby these fissures and caverns originate is the same as\r\nthat noticed already in the Spar Cave. Water containing an impregnation\r\nof carbonic acid filters down through cracks and fissures of the\r\ncalcareous rock, dissolving out in its passage a portion of the lime\r\nwhich it eventually carries back to the surface, and either deposits\r\nthere or transports into streams, and thence to the sea. Thus atom\r\nby atom is removed wherever the percolating water reaches, until in\r\nthe course of ages an irregular cavern of greater or less extent is\r\nproduced. The decomposition of limestone at the surface results from\r\nthe same kind of action, that of carbonated water. Every shower of\r\nrain insensibly carries away a fraction of the constituent parts of\r\nthe rock, so that the size and form of detached blocks as well as of\r\nexposed cliffs is constantly changing. How often do we see the same\r\ndecay going on with a melancholy rapidity among the exposed marble\r\ntombstones of our churchyards. In a few years the tablet gets worn\r\nand furrowed as though it had stood there for centuries. Eventually,\r\ntoo, the inscription becomes effaced, and perhaps ere the bones of the\r\ndeceased have mouldered away and mingled with their kindred dust, the\r\nepitaph that recorded for the admiration of posterity his many virtues\r\nand his vigorous talents, has faded from the stone--often, alas! only\r\ntoo fit an emblem of how speedily the memory of the dead may fade away\r\nout of the land of the living.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Mechanical forces at work in the disintegration of rocks--Rains\r\n       Landslips--Effects of frosts--Glaciers and icebergs--Abrading\r\n       power of rivers--Suggested volume on the geology of\r\n       rivers--Some of its probable contents--Scene in a woody\r\n       ravine--First idea of the origin of the ravine one of primeval\r\n       cataclysms--Proved to be incorrect--Love of the marvellous\r\n       long the bane of geology--More careful examination shows the\r\n       operations of Nature to be singularly uniform and gradual--The\r\n       doctrine of slow and gradual change not less poetic than that\r\n       of sudden paroxysms--The origin of the ravine may be sought\r\n       among some of the quieter processes of Nature--Features of\r\n       the ravine--Lessons of the waterfall--Course of the stream\r\n       through level ground--True history of the ravine--Waves and\r\n       currents--What becomes of the waste of the land--The Rhone\r\n       and the Leman Lake--Deltas on the sea-margin--Reproductive\r\n       effects of currents and waves--Usual belief in the stability\r\n       of the land and the mutability of the ocean--The reverse\r\n       true--Continual interchange of land and sea part of the\r\n       economy of Nature--The continuance of such a condition of\r\n       things in future ages rendered probable by its continuance\r\n       during the past.\r\n\r\nThe forms of decomposition noticed in the last chapter were chiefly\r\nof a chemical kind. Their effects were observable alike on the\r\nsurface of the earth and below ground; in the latter case we saw them\r\nexcavating caverns and long irregular chasms, in the former we noted\r\nthe production of debris which if undisturbed went to the formation\r\nof soils. It must be borne in mind however, that in these operations\r\nother forces than simply those of a chemical kind come into play. The\r\npercolation of water and the removal of insoluble particles on the\r\nexposed parts of rocks rank as mechanical processes. So also do those\r\nby which new surfaces of mineral masses are brought within the sphere\r\nof the chemical agencies, such as the action of frosts, rains, rivers,\r\nand waves. In short, as already noticed, any subdivision of the forces\r\nat work in effecting the decomposition of rocks must ever be more or\r\nless arbitrary; but it remains nevertheless useful, if we bear in\r\nmind that the exactly defined boundary lines are of our making, not\r\nNature's. With this caution we may proceed to examine what are termed\r\nthe mechanical agencies in the disintegration of mineral masses, and in\r\nso doing, we shall find that the chemical forces are not less helpful\r\nto the mechanical than the latter to the former.\r\n\r\nFirst, we may notice the effect of rains in washing away the\r\ndisintegrated particles to lower levels or into river-courses whereby\r\nfresh portions of rock become exposed to the decomposing forces. Rains\r\nalso act powerfully in altering the form of cliff-lines and steep\r\ndeclivities, especially where these consist more or less of friable\r\nearthy matter. After a long continuance of wet weather, I have seen\r\nthe abrupt sides of a river-channel that were formed of a stiff blue\r\nclay completely cut up by rents of various dimensions, whereby large\r\nmasses had subsided many feet, while others had rolled down altogether\r\nand lay in the bed of the stream where they were undergoing a rapid\r\nabrasion. The cause of this alteration was obvious. The rains pouring\r\ndown from the sloping grounds on either side of the river had excavated\r\ndeep channels on the abrupt face of the cliffs, while a considerable\r\nquantity of water finding its way through the soil, had permeated\r\nthrough joints and crevices in the clay some feet from the edge of the\r\nbank. By the combined operation of these causes, masses of clay several\r\nyards in extent lost their cohesion and either settled down a few\r\nfeet, or found their way to the bottom. Such landslips are of frequent\r\noccurrence where large masses of rock of a hard compact nature rest\r\nupon loose shales and clays more or less inclined. Whole hills have\r\nbeen known to be hurled in this way into the valleys below.\r\n\r\nBut these results become perhaps still more marked where to the\r\nordinary operations of water there are added those of intense frost.\r\nThe effects of a severe winter (such, for instance, as a Canadian one),\r\nin loosening the particles of rocks and facilitating the breaking-up\r\nof large masses, must be ranked among the most powerful agencies of\r\nnature. In such a season, the percolating water with which nearly every\r\nsurface-rock is charged becomes frozen, and in the act of congelation\r\nexpands. The result of this dilatation is to exert great pressure on\r\nthe particles of the rock, and thereby loosen their cohesion. When thaw\r\ncomes the frozen liquid contracts again, but the loosened particles\r\nhave no such elastic power, and so, having lost hold of each other,\r\ncrumble down. If the season be a changeable one, frost and thaw quickly\r\nalternating, the amount of waste produced becomes very great. Not only\r\nis the outer surface of the stone decomposed, but the water filtering\r\nthrough the joints of the rock freezes there, and thus on the arrival\r\nof milder weather vast masses become detached from the cliffs, and\r\nroll down, to be worn by the grinding action either of waves or of\r\nrivers, as the case may be. Spring at last sets in with its warmth and\r\nits showers; the snow rapidly melts away; the whole country streams\r\nwith water; every valley and hollow has its red turbid rivulet, that\r\nbears a burden of muddy sediment into the nearest river; and thus the\r\nloosened portions of the rocks get washed away down to sea, leaving a\r\nnew surface for the action of next winter. We can easily understand,\r\ntherefore, that in certain regions the combined effects of frost and\r\nthaw may work in the course of ages changes of almost inconceivable\r\nextent, and that the agency of ice must be not less varied and\r\nimportant on the land than, in the case of the boulder clay, we found\r\nit to be in the ocean.\r\n\r\nBesides this action in winter, which goes on more or less in every\r\ncountry wherever the temperature sinks sufficiently low to permit of\r\nthe freezing of water, ice effects many changes on the surfaces of\r\nrocks when it takes the form of glaciers and icebergs. We have already\r\nnoted the operation of a glacier during its slow progress in crushing\r\ndown large fragments of stone, scratching and abrading the rocks over\r\nwhich it passes, and eventually producing a vast quantity of mud, which\r\nis carried down by streams to form new accumulations either in lakes\r\nor seas. We have also marked the effects of the drifting iceberg in\r\nmaterially modifying the contour of submarine hills, and depositing\r\nover the ocean-bottom mud, gravel, and boulders. Nothing further,\r\ntherefore, need be done here than simply to keep these agencies in\r\nview, as playing an important part in the disintegration of rocks.\r\n\r\nAnother highly interesting aqueous action is that of streams and\r\nrivers, in scooping out for themselves channels through sometimes\r\nthe hardest and most solid rock. Such effects may be seen all over\r\nthe globe, in the old world and in the new, in the bed of the\r\ntiniest rivulet, as well as in the course of the mightiest river.\r\nAnd accordingly, in all the long list of geological agents, we find\r\nnone so well known and so often described alike by poets, historians,\r\nand scientific writers, as well in ancient as in modern times. What\r\na delightful volume might be written about the geology of rivers! It\r\nwould, perhaps, begin with that \"great river,\" the Euphrates, along\r\nwhose green banks lay the birthplace of the human race, tracing out the\r\nfeatures of its progress from the ravines and cataracts of Armenia,\r\nwith all their surrounding relics of ancient art, down into the plains\r\nof Assyria, amid date-palms and Arab villages, onwards to the mounds\r\nof Nineveh and Babylon, and thence to the waters of the Persian Gulf.\r\nWell-nigh as remote, and perhaps still more interesting in its human\r\nhistory, would be the story of the Nile. We should have to follow that\r\nriver from the mystic region of its birth,[53] marking the character\r\nof the rocks through which winds its earlier channel, and the effects\r\nupon them of the floods of untold centuries; it would be needful, too,\r\nto note the influence of the waters on the lower grounds, from where\r\nthe stream flows over the cataracts of Syene, down through the alluvial\r\nplains of Egypt; and lastly, the concluding and perhaps most onerous\r\npart of our labour would be the investigation of the delta, marking its\r\norigin and progress, its features in ancient times, as made known to us\r\nin the graphic chapters of Herodotus, and the changes which the lapse\r\nof more than twenty centuries has since wrought in its configuration.\r\nThe rivers of Europe would detain us long, not less perhaps by their\r\nhistoric interest than by the variety and attractiveness of their\r\nphysical phenomena. One could scarce help lingering over the Rhine,\r\nwith its source among Alpine glaciers, its lakes and gorges, its\r\ncastles and antique towns; and when once the narrative entered the\r\nclassic ground of Italy, it would perhaps become more antiquarian than\r\ngeological. The ravine of Tivoli, for instance, would certainly lay\r\nclaim to a whole chapter for itself, with its long-continued river\r\naction, its ancient travertin, its beautiful calcareous incrustations,\r\nand above all its exquisite scenery.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 53: \"Fontium qui celat origines Nilus\" a description not less\r\ntrue now than in the days of the Sabine bard.]\r\n\r\n           \"Domus Albuneæ resonantis,\r\n    Et præceps Anio, ac Tiburni lucus, et uda\r\n      Mobilibus pomaria rivis.\"[54]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 54:\r\n\r\n    \"Albuna's grey re-echoing home,\r\n    And Anio, headlong in his foam,\r\n      And grove of Tivoli,\r\n    And orchards with their golden gleam,\r\n    Whose boughs are dipping in the stream\r\n      That hurries to the sea.\"\r\n\r\nHor. _Carm._ L vii. 12.]\r\n\r\nAnd when could we exhaust all, that might be said about the rivers of\r\nour own land?\r\n\r\n        \"Of utmost Tweed, or Ouse, or gulfy Dun,\r\n    Or Trent, who, like some Earth-born giant, spreads\r\n    His thirty arms along the indented meads\r\n    Or sullen Mole, that runneth underneath;\r\n    Or Severn swift, guilty of maidens' death;\r\n    Or rocky Avon, or of sedgy Lee;\r\n    Or coaly Tyne, or ancient hallow'd Dee;\r\n    Or Humber loud, that keeps the Scythian's name;\r\n    Or Medway smooth, or royal-towered Thame.\"\r\n\r\nPassing to the new world, a vast field would spread out before us: the\r\nMississippi, the Atchafalaya, the Ohio, the St. Lawrence, the Amazon,\r\nand many other rivers that in some cases rise high among the regions\r\nof perpetual snow, and after traversing large areas of country in the\r\ntemperate zone, fall into the waters of tropical seas. By studying such\r\nexamples of river-action and delta-formation as are presented by these\r\ngigantic streams, we should arrive at some conception of the conditions\r\nanciently at work in producing our present coal-fields. Nor would our\r\nresearches assume aught like completion until after a scrutiny of all\r\nthe larger and more important rivers of the globe. Such a work could\r\nbe undertaken, perhaps, only by another Humboldt. Its successful\r\naccomplishment would certainly insure the highest renown to its author,\r\nand incalculable benefits to science.\r\n\r\nFrom what we have seen of the wide waste and decay everywhere in\r\nprogress on the solid lands of our planet, it becomes no difficult\r\nmatter to perceive what a number of agencies must be at work in the\r\nformation of a river channel. Let the reader take his stand in some\r\nwooded ravine, where the shelving rocks on either side are hung all\r\nover with verdure, and a tiny streamlet murmurs on beneath with a\r\nflow so quiet and gentle as scarcely to shake the long pendant willow\r\nbranches that dip into its surface, while the polished pebbles that\r\nstrew its bed lie unmoved by the rippling current that glides over\r\nthem. If in the midst of such a scene the question were to arise in\r\nhis mind, How came this deep, narrow ravine into existence? what\r\nanswer would in all likelihood be the first to suggest itself? His eye\r\nwould scan the precipitous walls of the dell, with their rocks cleft\r\nthrough to a depth of perchance fifty feet. It would require no great\r\nscrutiny to assure him that the beds on the one side formed the onward\r\nprolongations of those on the other, and that consequently there must\r\nhave been a time ere yet the ravine existed, when these beds stretched\r\nalong unbroken. Satisfied with these results, his first impulse might\r\nbe to bethink him of some primeval earthquake, when the solid land\r\nrocked to and fro like a tempested sea, and broke up into great rents\r\nand yawning chasms. Into one of these clefts he might suppose the\r\nlittle streamlet had eventually found its way, moistening the bare and\r\nbarren rocks, until at length their surface put on a livery of moss, or\r\nlichen, or liver-wort, and the birch, the alder, and the willow, found\r\na nestling-place in their crevices. Such a view of the origin of the\r\nwoody dell would be certainly a very natural one, and in some instances\r\nmight be sufficiently correct, but in the present case it will not\r\nexplain the phenomena. If the reader will kindly permit me to visit the\r\nlocality in his company, perhaps we may be able to light upon the true\r\nexplanation, and see a few appearances worthy our attention.\r\n\r\nFirst, then, how can we make sure that no convulsion of nature has\r\nproduced a rent in the rocks, and so helped the streamlet to a channel?\r\na simple question that may be well-nigh as simply answered. We stand\r\nin the centre of the dell on a broad ledge of stone, round whose\r\nwell-worn sides the rivulet is ever eddying onwards. The block consists\r\nof a pale sandstone lying in a bed about three feet thick, that dips\r\ngently down the stream and underlies a seam of dull, soft, blue shale,\r\nfull of small shells. We trace the edge of this sandstone bed across\r\nto the left-hand side of the ravine, and away up into the precipitous\r\ncliff, till it is lost amid the ferns and brushwood. There can be no\r\ndoubt, therefore, that the ledge on which we were but now standing is a\r\ncontinuous portion of the rocks that form the left side of the ravine.\r\nReturning again to the centre of the stream, we proceed to trace out\r\nthe course of the other end of the same bed, and find that it, too,\r\nstrikes across to the rocks on the right-hand side without a break\r\nor fissure, and passes up into the cliff, of which it forms a part.\r\nClearly, then, the sandstone bed runs in an unbroken, unfissured line,\r\nfrom the one side to the other, and the rocks of either cliff form\r\none continuous series. There occurs no break or dislocation, which,\r\nof course, there must have been had the ravine owed its origin to any\r\nsubterranean agency. And so we come to conclude that no great cataclysm\r\nin primeval times, no yawning abyss, or gaping chasm, has had anything\r\nwhatever to do with the formation of our deep sequestered dell. What\r\nthen? \"Whither shall we turn,\" you ask, \"to find another agency equally\r\ngrand and powerful in its operation and mighty in its results?\"\r\n\r\nStay, gentle reader. That craving for the grand and the sublime, that\r\nhungering after cataclysms and convulsions, that insatiable appetite\r\nfor upheavals, and Titanic earth-throes, and all the mightier machinery\r\nof Nature, has done no little mischief to geology. Men have reasoned\r\nthat gigantic results in the physical structure of the earth must\r\nhave had equally gigantic causes operating in sublime conflict and\r\nin periodic paroxysms, now heaving a mountain chain to the clouds\r\nof heaven, now swallowing up a continent in the depths of the sea.\r\nHappily such extreme notions are fast passing away, though the old\r\ntendency in a modified form still abounds. A closer scrutiny of Nature\r\nas she actually shows herself, not as theorists fancy she should be,\r\nhas revealed to us that her operations are for the most part slow,\r\ngradual, and uniform, and that she oftentimes produces the mightiest\r\nresults by combinations of forces that to us might seem the very\r\nemblems of feebleness and inactivity. In place of sudden paroxysms\r\nshe demands only an unlimited duration of time, and with the aid of\r\nbut a few of these simple, tardy agents, she will eventually effect\r\nresults perchance yet more gigantic than could be accomplished even\r\nby the grandest catastrophe. Nor in thus seeking to explain the past\r\nby defining what seems the usual mode of Nature's operations in the\r\npresent, do we, as is sometimes alleged, deprive them of their high\r\npoetic element. Assuredly there is something thrilling to even the\r\ncalmest imagination in contemplating the results of vast and sudden\r\nupheavals, in picturing the solid crust of the earth heaving like a\r\nground-swell upon the ocean, in tracing amid\r\n\r\n    \"Crags, knolls, and mounds, confusedly hurl'd,\r\n    The fragments of an earlier world;\"\r\n\r\nand in conjuring up visions of earthquakes, and frightful abysses from\r\nwhich there ever rose a lurid glare as hill after hill of molten rock\r\ncame belching up from the fires below. But while far from denying that\r\nsuch appearances may have been sometimes seen during the long lapse\r\nof the geological ages, and that they give no little vividness and\r\nsublimity to a geological picture, we claim for the doctrine of the\r\ntranquil and uniform operation during past time of existing laws and\r\nforces, an element not less poetic. In the former case the pervading\r\nidea is that of unlimited expenditure of power, in the latter that of\r\nunlimited lapse of time. In the one case the action is Titanic but\r\ntransient, in the other it is tranquil but immensely protracted. The\r\ntwo doctrines in this way counterbalance each other; yet I cannot but\r\nthink that however impressive it may be to stand in some lone glen, and\r\nwhile gazing at its dark jagged precipitous cliffs, to dream about the\r\nparoxysmal convulsions of some hour far back in the distant past, the\r\nscene becomes yet more impressive when we look on its nakedness and\r\nsublimity not as the sudden and capricious creation of a day, but as\r\nthe gradual result of a thousand centuries. These cliffs may once have\r\nbeen low-browed rocks rising but a little way out of a broad grassy\r\nplain, and serving as a noon-tide haunt for animals of long extinct\r\nraces. Thousands of years pass away and we see these same rocks higher\r\nand steeper in their outline, brown with algæ and ever wet with surf,\r\nwhile around them stretches a shoreless sea. Ages again roll on, and\r\nwe mark still the same rocks shooting up as bleak crags covered with\r\nice and snow. Another interval of untold extent elapses, and rock,\r\nsnow, and ice have all disappeared beneath a broad ocean cumbered\r\nwith ice-floes and wandering bergs. Again the curtain drops upon the\r\nscene, and when once more it rises, the cliffs stand out in much the\r\nsame abrupt precipitous aspect with that which they now present, save\r\nthat their bald foreheads look less seamed and scarred than now, and\r\ntheir dark sides show no trace of bush or tree. The white cascades that\r\nto-day pour down from their summits and sides--seeming in the distance\r\nlike the white hairs of age--are insensibly deepening the scars and\r\nfurrows on these ancient hills, and thus slowly but yet surely carrying\r\non the process of degradation and decay. Musing on all this long\r\nseries of stages in the formation of one single cliff-line, is there\r\nnot something more sublime, something yet more impressive than if we\r\npictured but the chance random result of the gigantic paroxysm of an\r\nhour?\r\n\r\nLet us not be deterred then from seeking an explanation of the origin\r\nof the ravine among some of the quieter and more unobtrusive forces\r\nof Nature. Give them but an unlimited period to work in and they will\r\nabundantly satisfy all our demands.\r\n\r\nWe return again to the rocky ledge in mid-channel, and proceed to\r\nascend the course of the stream, marking as we go the changes in the\r\ncharacter and features of the stone that forms the cliff on either\r\nhand. We come to a bare part of the ravine where brushwood and herbage\r\nfind but a scanty footing and where accordingly the rocks can be\r\nattentively studied. The face of the escarpment shows a number of beds\r\nof pale grey sandstone alternating with courses of a dark crumbly\r\nshale. The sandstones being harder and firmer in texture stand out\r\nin prominent relief while the shales between have been wasted away,\r\ncovering the bottom of the slope with loose debris. We can mark too\r\nthat, as this decay goes on, the harder beds continually lose their\r\nsupport, cracking across chiefly along the lines of joint, and rolling\r\ndown in huge angular blocks into the stream. In truth we cannot doubt\r\nthat every year adds to this decay and thus slowly widens the dell, for\r\nthe broken fragments do not form in heaps over the solid rock below\r\nso as to protect it from the weather, but are evidently carried away\r\nby the stream and hurried down the ravine onwards to the sea. From\r\nwhat has been said above relative to the disintegration of rocks by\r\npercolating water, frosts, and other causes, the reader will easily\r\nsee how this rotting away of the sides of the ravine must be carried\r\non; and he will not fail to mark that here we have at work an agency\r\nnot yet considered, that of running water. The effects of the weather\r\nare seen in the crumbling, ruinous cliffs overhead; the effects of\r\nthe streamlet are observable in the continual removal of the rubbish\r\nwhereby a fresh surface is ever exposed to the decomposing forces,\r\nwhile at some points we can mark the water actually undermining an\r\noverhanging part of the cliff from which there are ever and anon vast\r\nmasses precipitated into the channel where eventually they get worn\r\ndown and carried away out to sea. \"Still,\" you may remark, \"these\r\nforces are at work only in widening a channel already made. How was the\r\nravine formed at first?\"\r\n\r\nWe continue our ascent. A scrambling walk through briars and\r\nhazel-bushes, sometimes on rocky ledges high among the cliffs,\r\nsometimes among the prostrate blocks that dam up the stream, brings\r\nus at last full in front of a sparkling waterfall that dashes over\r\na precipitous face of rock some twenty feet high. The appearances\r\nobservable here deserve a careful attention. Our eyes have not been\r\nlong employed noting the more picturesque features of the scene ere\r\nthey discover that the dark-brown band of rock forming the summit of\r\nthe ledge over which the water tumbles is continuous all round the\r\nsides of the dell. There is consequently no break or dislocation here.\r\nApproaching the cascade we note the rock behind it so hollowed out that\r\nits upper bars project several feet beyond the under ones. In this\r\nway the body of water is shot clear over the top of the cliff without\r\ntouching rock till it comes splashing down among the blocks in the\r\nchannel. And yet this hollowed surface is never dry; the spray of the\r\nfall constantly striking on it keeps it always dank and dripping. In\r\nsome parts the rock stands out bare and worn, while on the less exposed\r\nportions there gathers a thick green scum which is replaced on the\r\ndrier ledges by the soft cellular leaves of the liver-wort. Now our\r\nexamination of the influence of percolating water upon even the hardest\r\nrocks teaches us that this moist soaked surface is just the very best\r\ncondition for favouring the decay of the rock. Nay more, the green\r\nvegetation that mantles over the stone serves to prevent the water from\r\nrunning off too rapidly, and keeps the rock in a still more moist state\r\nthan would otherwise happen. So that the portion of sandstone behind\r\nthe cascade comes to be in a still more favourable situation for speedy\r\ndecay than the ledge over which the water is rapidly driven. We can\r\nsee, therefore, how in the lapse of years the corrosion may go on until\r\nthe upper projecting part of the cliff loses its support and falls with\r\na crash into the rocky pool below, while the form of the waterfall\r\nbecomes thus greatly altered, and new surfaces are exposed to the wear\r\nand tear of the stream.\r\n\r\nBut we have not yet exhausted all that the rocks at the cascade can\r\nteach us. By dint of some exertion we climb the cliff and gain the\r\nupper edge of the fall. The rocks that form the bed of the stream are\r\nnow seen to be deeply grooved and worn, every exposed surface having\r\na smoothed blunted aspect. We can mark how the stone has split up\r\nalong the natural lines of joint, whereby great facility is given to\r\nthe removing power of the current, and how large irregular angulated\r\nblocks become detached and are swept down the stream. In not a few\r\nparts, too, we may notice circular holes of greater or less depth, in\r\nthe bottom of each of which lie perhaps a pebble or two, that with a\r\nconstant gyratory movement, caused by the eddying water, have eaten\r\ntheir way downwards into the solid rock. When the stream is in flood\r\nand comes roaring down the rocky gorge bearing along with it a vast\r\namount of mud, gravel, and stones, one can easily see how the friction\r\nof the transported material must wear down the hard bed and sides of\r\nthe channel, and how this process repeated month after month and year\r\nafter year, must aid the decomposing forces in scooping out a deep\r\nravine. From the cascade the ascent of the stream becomes steeper and\r\nthe run of water is consequently more rapid. Soon however we emerge\r\nfrom the woody copse, and find ourselves on a flat alluvial cultivated\r\nplain through which the rivulet winds in a tortuous meandering course,\r\nbending back upon itself into loops that almost meet and well-nigh\r\nform broad flat islets. Strolling along this winding route we can mark\r\nthe effects of the stream in eating away the soft clay and sand at one\r\npart of the bend and piling them up at another. Such loose material\r\ncan present but little resistance to a stream swollen with rains, and\r\nconsequently a large quantity of the mud and gravel along with the\r\ninterspersed boulders must be swept away down into the dell at every\r\nseason of flood. The matter thus removed will of course be still\r\nfurther comminuted in its passage, and at the same time will help to\r\ngrind down the hard rock surfaces over which it is driven.\r\n\r\nHere then may be found the whole history of the ravine. Originally the\r\nstreamlet wound its devious course through a flat alluvial country with\r\na channel sunk but a foot or two below the level of the plain. Such\r\ncontinued its character till it reached a low bluff, down which the\r\nwater flowed more rapidly to gain a second level undulating region.\r\nThe part of this bluff crossed by the stream was ere long bared of\r\nits covering of soil and clay, and the rock below came to be washed\r\nby a group of little cascades. Once exposed to the decomposing and\r\ndisintegrating forces, the stone soon began to decay and the cascades\r\nere long merged into one. By slow degrees the rock gave way and the\r\nwaterfall retreated from the bluff. For perchance thousands of years\r\nthe same process has been going on, now with greater, now with less\r\nrapidity, according to the nature of the rocks encountered and other\r\nmodifying causes, until the fall has eaten its way back for well-nigh\r\nthree miles and scooped out a wild rocky gorge some fifty or sixty feet\r\ndeep. This is but a solitary and insignificant instance of what may be\r\nseen all over the world, for the process remains the same whether we\r\nstand beside a tiny rivulet in some lone Highland glen or listen to the\r\nroar of the falls of Niagara.\r\n\r\nThere is but one other principal agency at work in the demolition of\r\nrock-masses, the waves and currents of the ocean. But we have already\r\nnoted the effects thus produced, and need not now retrace our steps\r\nfurther than to recall the vast amount of devastation which can be\r\nshown to have been effected in our own country by marine causes, both\r\nin breaching the existing shores and in scooping out valleys and\r\ngrinding down hills at former periods when the land was either rising\r\nabove or sinking below the level of the sea.\r\n\r\nHaving now satisfied ourselves that there goes on all over the world an\r\nincessant waste of the solid lands, that the disintegrated debris is\r\nwashed down by rains and transported seawards by rivers, and that the\r\nwaves are ever eating their way into the iron-bound coast-line as well\r\nas into the low alluvial shore, we naturally come to ask the result\r\nand end of all this decay. What becomes of that vast amount of mineral\r\nmatter annually removed from the land? To be able to answer this\r\nquestion clearly and distinctly, let us look for a little at what takes\r\nplace in lakes, at river-mouths, and in open sea.\r\n\r\nThe river Rhone rises among the Bernese Alps, and after a course of\r\nabout 100 miles through the Canton of Valais, it enters the upper end\r\nof the Lake of Geneva. Its waters, where they mingle with those of the\r\nlake, are muddy and discoloured, but where they pass out at the town of\r\nGeneva are limpid and clear. The mud, therefore, which they bring into\r\nthe lake must be deposited there, and as the stream may have continued\r\nto flow for thousands of years, we may reasonably expect to find some\r\ntrace of the large amount of sediment necessarily deposited during the\r\nwhole or part of that long period. Accordingly, careful examination of\r\nthe Lake of Geneva has shown that such accumulations have really been\r\nformed, and that their progress and amount during part of the historic\r\nperiod can be approximately calculated. Where the turbid current of the\r\nRhone enters the still water of the lake, the mud slowly sinks to the\r\nbottom. In the lapse of centuries layer after layer has been thrown\r\ndown, rendering the lake at this part sensibly shallower, until a large\r\narea or delta has been filled up and converted into a flat alluvial\r\nplain. Thus, a town which in the time of the Romans formed a harbour\r\non the water's edge, now stands more than a mile and a half inland.\r\nThis new-formed land is entirely the work of the stream, and if we\r\ncould obtain a complete section of it from the surface to the bottom,\r\n\"we should see a great series of strata, probably from 600 to 900 feet\r\nthick (the supposed original depth of the head of the lake), and nearly\r\ntwo miles in length, inclined at a very slight angle.\" These strata,\r\nwhich are said to have taken about eight centuries to form, \"probably\r\nconsist of alternations of finer and coarser particles; for, during the\r\nhotter months, from April to August, when the snows melt, the volume\r\nand velocity of the river are greatest, and large quantities of sand,\r\nmud, vegetable matter, and drift-wood, are introduced; but, during the\r\nrest of the year, the influx is comparatively feeble, so much so that\r\nthe whole lake, according to Saussure, stands six feet lower.\"[55] If\r\nthe present conditions continue for a sufficient length of time, the\r\nlake may be eventually filled up with mud, sand, and gravel, deposits\r\nthat would eventually harden by pressure into shale and sandstone. So\r\nthat the day may yet arrive when the blue waters of the Leman lake\r\nshall have passed away, when the Rhone perchance may have ceased to\r\nflow or found its way by some other channel, when the peasant may guide\r\nthe plough where now the boatman plies the oar, and when the geologist\r\nshall trace out in quarries and excavations the successive deposits of\r\nhardened sediment with their lacustrine shells and drift-wood, and,\r\nmusing on the changes of which they are the silent yet impressive\r\nwitnesses, may sit down to pen a record of the gradual extinction of\r\nthe Leman lake on that classic ground where an immortal historian\r\ndescribed the decline and fall of the empire of Rome.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 55: Lyell's _Principles of Geology_. Ninth edition, p. 252.]\r\n\r\nThe alluvial matter deposited by the Rhone at its entrance into the\r\nLake of Geneva suffers perhaps no change when it once reaches the\r\nbottom. Layer after layer accumulates tranquilly, without disturbance\r\nfrom surface currents or other causes, so that the renovating effects\r\nof the stream have here every advantage. It is otherwise, however,\r\nwhere a delta gathers at the mouth of a river upon the sea-margin.\r\nThere tides and currents are ever demolishing what the stream has\r\npiled up. Often, too, owing to the prevalence of high winds from\r\nseawards, the river is dammed up for leagues, and the waters of\r\nthe ocean encroach far on the delta, mingling in this way marine\r\nremains with those that are fluviatile or terrestrial. But with these\r\nmodifications the process of delta-formation remains essentially the\r\nsame, both in lakes and at the sea. The vast quantities of sand and\r\ngravel transported by rivers during the flood-season sink to the bottom\r\nas soon as the motion of the water will permit. This takes place at\r\nthe shore, where eventually wide tracts of low alluvial land encroach\r\nupon the sea, covered with marshes and overgrown with vegetation. A\r\nsection of any of these deltas, obtained in boring for water, shows a\r\nsuccession of sands and clays, with occasionally a few calcareous beds\r\nand quantities of peaty matter formed of vegetation either drifted\r\nor that grew on the spot.[56] If, now, a sufficient amount of matter\r\nwere piled over these loose incoherent strata, they would eventually\r\nbecome as hard and compact as any of our ordinary building stones. The\r\nsand would subside into a firm compact sandstone; the clay, in like\r\nmanner, would consolidate into fissile shale; the peat would become\r\nchemically altered into coal; the calcareous seams would take the form\r\nof layers of limestone; while the leaves, twigs, branches, and trunks,\r\ndispersed through all the beds, would get black and carbonized, so as\r\nprecisely to resemble the lepidodendra, calamites, stigmariæ, &c., of\r\nthe carboniferous rocks. And thus might a mass of fossiliferous strata,\r\nthousands of feet deep and thousands of square miles in extent, be\r\namassed by the prolonged operation of a single river.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 56: The structure of maritime deltas, especially their\r\nrelation to the growth and entombment of forests, will be more fully\r\nalluded to in a subsequent chapter, when we come to inquire into the\r\norigin of a coal-field.]\r\n\r\nIt often happens that a delta is prevented from extending further\r\nseawards owing to the prevalence of some marine current that comes\r\nsweeping along the coast-line and cuts away the accumulations thrown\r\ndown by the river. The sediment thus removed is often carried to great\r\ndistances, and eventually settles down as a fine mud along the floor of\r\nthe sea, entombing any fucoids, infusoria, shells, corals, fish-bones,\r\nor other relics that may lie at the bottom.\r\n\r\nHe who has witnessed a storm along a rocky coast-line, has marked the\r\nbreakers battering against the weather-bleached cliffs, and heard the\r\nthunder-like rattle of the shingle at the recoil of every wave, needs\r\nnot to be told how vast an amount of sediment must in this way be\r\nformed. The pebbles of the beach are ground down still smaller, the\r\nsand produced by their friction finds its way to a lower level, while\r\nthe finer particles taken up by the water are borne out to sea, and if\r\na current traverse the locality may be transported for leagues, till\r\nthey at last settle to the bottom. The floor of the sea is consequently\r\nalways receiving additions in the form of fine mud--the waste of the\r\nland--derived either from breaker-action, rivers, or icebergs, so\r\nthat a series of marine deposits exactly similar to those we find\r\namong the rocks of our hills and valleys, must be constantly in the\r\ncourse of formation. If circumstances be favourable, the shingle of\r\nthe beach may eventually either be covered over or reach a part of\r\nthe sea undisturbed by currents or waves, and then consolidate into\r\nwhat we call conglomerate or pudding-stone. The sand, as before,\r\nbecomes sandstone, and the mud laminated shale or hardened clay. These\r\ndeposits may go on forming for thousands of years, until at last some\r\nslow elevation or some sudden upheaval of the ocean bed brings them to\r\nthe light of day as part of a new continent. Thus exposed they would\r\ndiffer in no respect from rocks of a similar kind now visible, and\r\nthe geologist, in tracing out their origin and history, would have no\r\nhesitation in ranking them among the ordinary marine formations of the\r\nglobe.\r\n\r\nIn fine, we cannot quit the subject without being convinced that\r\nthese ceaseless changes afford one of the grandest examples of that\r\ncontinuous series of mutations--cycle and epicycle--which has been\r\nalready alluded to as a distinguishing feature in all the operations\r\nof Nature. We are accustomed to think and speak of \"the everlasting\r\nhills.\" We look on the solid lands whereon we dwell as the emblem of\r\nall that is stable and steadfast, and on the boundless ocean as the\r\ntype of all that is unsteady and changeful. The traveller who stands\r\non those plains where the human race was cradled, marks still the same\r\nvalleys with their winding rivers, still the same rocks and hills,\r\nstill the same blue sky overhead. The dust of centuries has gathered\r\nover the graves and the dwellings of the early races, yet the covering\r\nis but thin, and if we could conjure from their resting-place some\r\nof these venerable patriarchs, they might perhaps see little or no\r\nchange on the haunts of their boyhood. We feel it otherwise, however,\r\nwhen we contemplate the ocean. In sunshine and in storm its surface\r\nnever rests. The wave that now breaks against some bald headland of\r\nour western shores may have come sweeping across from the coast of\r\nAmerica, and the broad swell that rolls into surf along the shores\r\nof Newfoundland may have travelled from the frozen seas of the North\r\nPole. And so it has ever been; the \"far resounding sea\" of Homer is the\r\n\"far resounding sea\" still; and the \"countless dimpling of the waves,\"\r\ninvoked in his agony by the chained Prometheus, remains restless and\r\nplayful as ever.\r\n\r\n\"Firm as a rock,\" and \"fickle as the sea,\" have therefore become\r\nproverbs of universal acceptance. Yet when we investigate the matter\r\nas we have done in this and the preceding chapter, it appears that an\r\nexactly opposite arrangement would be nearer the truth. It is the sea\r\nthat remains constant--\r\n\r\n    \"Time writes no wrinkle on its azure brow;\"\r\n\r\nwhile the land undergoes a continual change. Hills are insensibly\r\nmouldering away, valleys are ever being widened and deepened, rocky\r\ncoasts and low alluvial shores suffer a constant abrasion, while\r\neven within the bowels of the earth the process of decomposition\r\nuninterruptedly proceeds. And thus, in place of remaining unchanged\r\nfrom the beginning, we know of nothing more mutable than the land on\r\nwhich we dwell, so that if the waste everywhere so apparent were to\r\ngo on unchecked or unmodified, island and continent would eventually\r\ndisappear beneath the waves. Here, however, another principle comes\r\ninto operation. The debris removed from the land, as we have seen,\r\nis not annihilated. Slowly borne seawards, it settles down at river\r\nmouths or on the floor of the ocean as an ever-thickening deposit,\r\nwhich eventually hardens into rock, as solid and enduring as that\r\nwhence it was derived. But it does not always remain there. Owing to\r\nthe action of subterranean agencies with which we are but slightly\r\nacquainted, different parts of the sea-bottom are continually rising.\r\nSometimes this process goes on very slowly, as along the shores\r\nof Sweden, where the coast has been ascertained to emerge in some\r\nlocalities at the rate of about thirty inches in a century; sometimes\r\nwith prodigious rapidity, as on the coast of Chili, where the land\r\nwas upheaved from two to seven feet in a single night. There can thus\r\nbe no doubt that the mysterious agency which produces earthquakes and\r\nvolcanoes on the land affects equally that portion of the earth's crust\r\ncovered by the waters of the ocean, and must be ceaselessly employed\r\nin elevating large areas of sea-bottom into new continents, that will\r\nere long become clothed with vegetation and peopled with animals.\r\nIn contemplating, therefore, the constant decay in progress on the\r\nsurface of the land, we see not a mere isolated process of waste, but a\r\nprovision for future renovation. The sandstone cliffs of the shore are\r\nbattered down and their debris carried out to sea, but when sea-bottom\r\ncomes to be land-surface, they may be sandstone cliffs again, lashed\r\nonce more by the breakers, and once more borne as sediment to the\r\ndepths of the sea. And thus, in what may seem to us sublime antagonism,\r\nland is ever rising in the domain of ocean, and ocean ever encroaching\r\non the regions of land. No sooner does a new island, or mountain peak,\r\nor wide area of continent, appear above the waves, than the abrading\r\nagencies are at work again. Rain, air, frost, rivers, currents,\r\nbreakers, all begin anew the process of destruction, and cease not\r\nuntil the land has utterly disappeared, and its worn debris has sunk\r\nin mid-ocean to be in process of time once more dry land, and suffer\r\nanother slow process of obliteration.\r\n\r\nSuch is the economy of nature around us now, and that such will\r\ncontinue to remain the condition of things in the future, we can affirm\r\nwith probability from a consideration of the history of the past. The\r\ngeologist can point to masses of rock several miles in thickness, and\r\noccupying a large area of the globe, formed entirely of the worn debris\r\nof pre-existing formations. The very oldest rocks with which he is\r\nacquainted are made up of hardened sediment, pointing to the existence\r\nof some land, even at that early period, worn down by rivers or\r\nwasted by the sea. During all the subsequent ages the same principles\r\nwere at work, and now well-nigh the only evidence of the geological\r\nperiods is to be gathered from the layers of sediment that successively\r\nsettled down at the sea-bottom. The records which it is the task of\r\nthe geologist to decipher, are for the most part written in sand and\r\nmud--the deposits of the ocean, for in by far the larger number of\r\nformations into which the stratified part of the earth's crust has been\r\ndivided, and which form his only guide to the history of the past, he\r\ncan detect no trace of land. Hill and valley have alike disappeared,\r\nand the character of their scenery and inhabitants he can often but\r\ndimly conjecture from the nature of the sediment and of the drifted\r\nterrestrial relics that may chance to be found among strata wholly\r\nmarine.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The structure of the stratified part of the earth's\r\n       crust conveniently studied by the examination of a\r\n       single formation--A coal-field selected for this\r\n       purpose--Illustration of the principles necessary to such\r\n       an investigation--The antiquities of a country of value in\r\n       compiling its pre-historic annals--Geological antiquities\r\n       equally valuable and more satisfactorily arranged--Order\r\n       of superposition of stratified formations--Each formation\r\n       contains its own suite of organic remains--The age of\r\n       the boulder defined by this test from fossils--Each\r\n       formation as a rule shades into the adjacent ones--Mineral\r\n       substances chiefly composing the stratified rocks few\r\n       in number--Not of much value in themselves as a test of\r\n       age--The Mid-Lothian coal-basin--Its subdivisions--The\r\n       limestone of Burdiehouse--Its fossil remains--Its probable\r\n       origin--Carboniferous limestone series of Mid-Lothian--Its\r\n       relation to that of England--Its organic remains totally\r\n       different from those of Burdiehouse--Structure and\r\n       scenery of Roman Camp Hill--Its quarries of the mountain\r\n       limestone--Fossils of these quarries indicative of an ancient\r\n       ocean-bed--Origin of the limestones--Similar formations still\r\n       in progress--Coral-reefs and their calcareous silt--Sunset\r\n       among the old quarries of Roman Camp Hill.\r\n\r\nAmong the standard jokes of ancient Athens was that of the simpleton\r\nwho, with the intent of selling his house, carried about a brick as a\r\nspecimen. In this and the following chapter I propose to follow his\r\nexample, and, for the purpose of giving my reader a correct notion of\r\nthe structure displayed in the stratified portion of the earth's crust,\r\nto select therefrom a single formation whose details will connect\r\ntogether the subjects discussed in the previous pages. And in so doing\r\nit will, I trust, be found that what was ludicrous in the hands of\r\nthe Greek becomes sober sense in those of the geologist. The \"brick,\"\r\nthen, which I would humbly present to the thoughtful consideration of\r\nthe reader as really a specimen of the house of which it forms a part,\r\nhas been termed the \"Carboniferous System,\" and consists of a series\r\nof stratified rocks sometimes nearly 15,000 feet thick. The plants\r\nand animals found in these strata have been already described somewhat\r\nin detail, and we have turned aside to look at the processes whereby\r\nsuch masses of sedimentary rock came to be accumulated. But we shall\r\nprobably better understand the habits of the animals and the general\r\naspect of the vegetation, as well as the agencies at work in depositing\r\nvast beds of mineral matter, if we take a coal-field and analyse it\r\nstratum by stratum, marking as we go their varied and ever-changing\r\ncharacter, and the corresponding diversity of the included organic\r\nremains. Such an examination will bring before us some of the more\r\nstriking and important laws of geological research, and while of use\r\nto the young observer, may be not without some share of interest\r\nto the general reader. Before beginning, however, let me endeavour\r\nto illustrate the principles that will guide us by a simple though\r\nhypothetical story.\r\n\r\nSuppose the bed of the Firth of Forth were raised above the level of\r\nthe sea and covered over with verdure, and that, in ignorance of the\r\nprevious topography of the locality, a mason were to excavate on the\r\nlately-born land the foundation for a dwelling-house. Immediately\r\nbelow the grass he would com? upon layers of hardened mud containing\r\noyster-beds, with detached valves of cockles, mussels, fish-bones, and\r\nperhaps the tooth of an anchor or the timber of some old herring-boat.\r\nNow, if he were gifted with but ordinary intelligence, what would he at\r\nonce conclude from these remains? Plainly, that the spot on which he\r\nstood had once been the bed of the sea. And if in place of appearing\r\nas dry mud and sand these deposits had got hardened into shale and\r\nsandstone, and the shells, too, had become hard and stony, this would\r\nnot alter his convictions. He would still assert positively that he\r\nstood upon an old sea-bottom. And suppose further, that all this were\r\nfar away from any sea, still such a circumstance could make no change\r\nin his opinion; he would rightly assert that the place of sea and\r\nland might vary, and that the ocean's being now many miles distant\r\ncould be no argument against the waves having once rolled over the\r\nsite of the intended dwelling-house. Let us further imagine that he\r\ncontinues his trench, and in sinking deeper comes to a bed of dark\r\npeat with snail-shells and bones of sheep, deer, and oxen. What will\r\nhe infer from these? Clearly that they represent an old land-surface,\r\nonce covered with vegetation and browsed over by ruminant animals, and\r\nthat this old land-surface has at some distant period been submerged\r\nbeneath the sea. Suppose, moreover, that below the peat there were a\r\nthin bed of reeds and rushes intermingled with the mouldering remains\r\nof fresh-water shells. He would in that case infer that before the\r\nformation of the peat the locality was occupied by a lake.\r\n\r\nPutting now all these deductions together, our mason would have evolved\r\na very interesting history. He would have ascertained that in a bygone\r\nage the spot on which he stood was the site of a lake, tenanted by\r\ndelicate shells and fringed with reeds and rushes, where the coot and\r\nthe mallard may have reared their young; that in process of time the\r\nvegetation gained upon the water, choking up the lake, so as gradually\r\nto form a soil firm enough to support sheep, deer, and oxen, and\r\nyielding shady coverts whither the antlered stag could retire and lay\r\nhim down to die; that in after years the sea had encroached upon the\r\npeat-moss, and oyster-beds begun to form where cattle had been wont to\r\nbrowse; that again the ocean receded, and the land emerged to assume\r\nnew verdure and receive new inhabitants.\r\n\r\nNow, in all this reasoning there is no hypothesis or speculation. The\r\nmason proves himself an intelligent, honest fellow, and uses his eyes\r\nand his head where many other men would perchance see very little need\r\nfor the use of either. There can be no setting aside of his story;\r\nhe can appeal to facts. \"There,\" says he, \"is a layer of peat with\r\nthe rush-stalks and moss-fibres matted together in the soft brown\r\nmouldering substance, exactly as I have seen them a hundred times in\r\nthe peat-cuttings on the moors, and I cannot but believe that they\r\nmust both have had the same origin, that is, that they grew in swampy\r\nhollows of the land. There, too, lies a stratum of fresh-water shells\r\nidentical with those that occur in our ponds and marshes. Although\r\nmouldering now, they are evidently not fragmentary, but entire and\r\nunbroken; some of them are young, others full-grown, and they lie\r\ngrouped together as in our present lakes. Such shells could only live\r\nin fresh water, therefore the spot where I stand must have been at one\r\ntime a fresh-water lake. There, again,\" he continues, \"is a bed of\r\noysters which cannot have been transported hither, for their valves are\r\ntogether, lying just as they do in our present oyster-beds. This green\r\nfield, therefore, must have been at one period a muddy sea-bottom.\"\r\n\r\nAfter this manner and upon this kind of evidence must all inquiries\r\ninto the past changes of the earth's surface be conducted. And provided\r\nonly we proceed cautiously, reasoning from positive facts, and\r\nstriving as far as possible to exhaust what Bacon calls the \"negative\r\ninstances,\" our deductions possess all the certainty of truth. For in\r\nmuch the same fashion do we derive no small part of our acquaintance\r\nwith the early history of our own land, as well as with the arts\r\nand customs of other nations. The scattered relics turned up by the\r\noperations of the farmer--wooden canoes, flint hatchets, gold torques,\r\nbronze pots, fragments of pottery, and rusty coins--all have their\r\nbearing upon the annals of the country, and so clear is the evidence\r\nwhich they read out that an eminent antiquary has divided the early\r\nages of Scotland into three periods, distinguished, from the character\r\nof their relics, as the \"Stone Period,\" the \"Bronze Period,\" and the\r\n\"Iron Period.\"[57] But in such a classification the historian has\r\nlittle to guide him save the nature of the relics themselves. He places\r\nthe rudest first, and groups the rest in succession, according to the\r\ndegree of advancement in civilisation which they respectively indicate.\r\nAnd the grouping seems just, though in some cases objects belonging\r\nto two of these periods may have been to some extent contemporaneous,\r\njust as thatched roofs gave way to tiles, tiles to slates, and slates\r\npartly to lead, though at the present day a walk of half an hour in\r\nsome localities will bring before us specimens of all these styles\r\nstill in use. If, however, the relics of geological history lay\r\nscattered about like those of early Scottish history, all hope of\r\never attaining to anything like a correct chronology and arrangement\r\nwould have to be abandoned in despair. In truth, it would then be\r\nimpossible to conjecture whether any succession of ages preceded man,\r\nduring which other tribes of plants and animals lived and died, or\r\nwhether the whole mass of fossiliferous rocks had been accumulated\r\nsince the human era, or perhaps created just as we find them. But all\r\nthis uncertainty and confusion has been obviated simply by the fossils\r\nbeing ranged in beds vertically above each other, the oldest at the\r\nbottom and the latest at the top. So that if we find in a low cliff\r\nalong the shore blown sand and broken whelks immediately beneath the\r\nvegetable mould, and oyster-valves in a clayey bed three feet below, we\r\npronounce the oysters to have lived before the whelks, and that between\r\ntheir respective lifetimes a sufficient interval must have elapsed to\r\nallow three feet of sand, clay, and gravel, to accumulate. What is thus\r\ntrue on the small scale holds equally so on the large. The stratified\r\nformations in which organic remains occur are found to be grouped\r\nregularly over each other in a settled invariable order. If A be below\r\nB in England it will be below B all over the world, and if C be above\r\nD at the North Pole it will be so at the South Pole too, and at every\r\nlocality where the two rocks lie together. This order of superposition\r\nforms one of the grand tests for the age of different rock masses. By\r\nmeans of this simple rule the geologist has been enabled to arrange\r\nthe different stratified formations, supplying the missing portions of\r\none locality from the more complete series of another, so as to form a\r\nchronological table of no small part of our planet's primeval history.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 57: See Dr. Daniel Wilson's deeply interesting work _The\r\nPre-historic Annals of Scotland_.]\r\n\r\nBut this is not all. We must attend to the character of the organisms\r\nas well as to their order of occurrence. We must distinguish the animal\r\nfrom the vegetable, the terrestrial from the marine, and scrupulously\r\nexamine the peculiarities of each so as to recognise them again in\r\nother strata. By such careful scrutiny we may trace out the successive\r\nchanges in the physical aspect of a district during past times,\r\nviewing in terrestrial plants (when clearly occupying their original\r\nsite) evidence of an old land-surface; in _cyprides_, _unios_, and\r\n_paludinæ_, traces of a former lake; and in corals and marine shells,\r\nunmistakable proofs of an ancient sea-bottom. Still further, by marking\r\nthe specific character of such fossils we obtain a key to the age of\r\nmany rocks that otherwise would be unintelligible, for it is found that\r\neach of the stratified formations, from the oldest upwards, has its own\r\npeculiar and characteristic organisms recognisable all over the world.\r\nThis test of the geological position and age of any fossiliferous rock\r\nhas a peculiar value, for it can be applied with infallible success\r\nwhere every other fails. The order of superposition is often obscured\r\nby dislocations and other causes, and the mineralogical texture of a\r\nformation may change entirely in a short space; but if the imbedded\r\nfossils remain, we can be at no loss as to the relationship of the rock\r\nwhich contains them. And hence, if in some lone island of the Hebrides,\r\nhaunted only by the screaming sea-fowl, we find a patch of shale\r\ncontaining ammonites, belemnites, and a host of other shells in large\r\nmeasure identical with those occurring among the clays and limestones\r\nof Gloucestershire, we infer that they must all belong to one series\r\nand be of the same age; that, as we know the English beds to form part\r\nof a formation called Lias, of which, the exact place in the geological\r\nscale has been ascertained, so in like manner the Scottish beds must\r\noccupy a position in the same series; and that consequently there was\r\na time when the site of Cheltenham and part of the Hebrides lay each\r\nbeneath a sea which teemed with ammonites, belemnites, and many other\r\nmollusca, along, too, with the bulky saurians of the Lias. And yet\r\nno study of the surrounding rocks in the northern locality, even if\r\ncarried on for a thousand years, could ever have thrown one ray of\r\nlight upon the subject. In an earlier page our grey rounded boulder\r\nwas introduced to the reader as a mass of sandstone belonging to the\r\nCarboniferous group of rocks. How could one be sure of the precise\r\ngeological age of a loose water-worn block that might have journeyed\r\nall round the world? Simply by its included fossils. The calamite,\r\nlepidodendron, and stigmaria, revealed the date of the stone as clearly\r\nand unmistakably as if we had seen it lifted from its original bed\r\nby the lever and crane of the quarryman. These plants are peculiarly\r\ncharacteristic of the Carboniferous strata, and they consequently\r\nstamp as undoubtedly of carboniferous age the rock which contains\r\nthem, whether it be sandstone or conglomerate, limestone or shale, and\r\nwhether we meet with it among the newly-raised blocks of the quarry,\r\nor among the pebbles of the sea-shore. Each geological formation, I\r\nrepeat, beginning at the oldest known to us, and ending with those that\r\nare still forming in our lakes and seas, has its own set of organic\r\nremains whereby we can detect it wherever it may chance to occur, from\r\nthe equator to the poles. Each has its _style_, so to speak, just as\r\nwe can at once tell whether a drawing represents a Hindoo, Egyptian,\r\nAssyrian, Greek, or Gothic temple, simply from the general _style_ of\r\nthe architecture.\r\n\r\nCould we but voyage back in time as we can sail forward in space,\r\nwe should find each of the geological formations not less clearly\r\ndefined than are the different nations and countries of the present\r\nday.[58] Were the reader suddenly set down in an out-of-the-way street\r\nof Paris, he would probably not be long in discovering that he stood\r\non French ground. Or if spirited away in his sleep he should awake on\r\nthe banks of the Nile, he would soon ascertain himself to be in the\r\nland of the Ptolemies. And so if you transported a geologist blindfold\r\ninto a quarry where ammonites and belemnites abounded, mingled here\r\nand there with bones of ichthyosaurs and plesiosaurs, he would tell\r\nyou at once that the quarry lay among liassic strata. Or if he were\r\nplaced in a ravine where the rocks on either hand displayed fern-stems,\r\nlepidodendra, stigmariæ, and sigillariæ, he would tell you that the\r\nsurrounding district was one of carboniferous rocks, and that probably\r\nat no great distance there might be found smoking engines and dozens\r\nof coal-pits. Or could you set him down in some dark night upon a\r\nwild coast-line, and show him, perchance by the flare of torch-light,\r\nbones and scales of osteolepis, pterichthys, and dipterus, lying on\r\nthe rocks around, he would tell you that the grim crags which shot up\r\ninto the gloom were as ancient as the era of the Old Red Sandstone. In\r\nany case the character of the rock would signify nothing, nor would\r\nhe care about the general features of the landscape, though these too\r\nbecome important characteristics in certain cases. Show him but a few\r\nrecognisable fossils, and you give him, as it were, an \"Open Sesame\" to\r\nwhich the rocks unfold their gates and reveal a store of wonders yet\r\nmore varied than those in the cave of Ali Baba.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 58: See _ante_, pp. 31, 32, and the Table of Rocks at the end\r\nof the volume.]\r\n\r\nBut though the geological systems stand thus strongly marked off from\r\neach other when viewed as a whole, their boundary lines can often be\r\nonly approximately drawn, thereby reminding us that the divisions are\r\nof man's device, and can have had no place in the plans of Him who\r\nneeds not to chronicle His working by years and ages, but with whom\r\nthere is no past and no future. One formation insensibly passes into\r\nanother just as one nation merges into those around it. There are\r\nsometimes gaps, however, between the formations, serving to mark out\r\nstrongly the limits of each,[59] precisely as intervening seas and\r\nmountain-chains serve to mark put the boundaries of different peoples\r\nand tribes.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 59: Such cases, however, are probably merely local, and may\r\nhave originated from some features in the ancient physical geography\r\nof the districts where they occur. For instance, it has always been\r\nthought that palæozoic ages were marked off by a strong line of\r\ndemarcation from succeeding secondary times. But the gap which occurs\r\nin England, France, and Germany, is being slowly filled up from the\r\nevidence furnished by other countries, and we shall probably find in\r\nthe end that the Permian dovetailed with the Trias as closely as the\r\nSilurian with the Old Red, or the Lias with the Oolite. In truth, the\r\nlonger we study the past history of our planet the less do we see of\r\nhiatus and chasm and sharp clearly defined boundary line; while the\r\ndoctrine of a uniform system of laws and arrangements in the physical\r\nworld, first philosophically propounded in the immortal \"Principles\" of\r\nSir Charles Lyell, is ever receiving fresh confirmation.]\r\n\r\nThe mineral substances of which these formations consist are\r\ncomparatively few in number, being chiefly varieties of sandstone,\r\nshale, conglomerate, and limestone. One sandstone can often be scarcely\r\ndistinguished from another, and so also with the other rocks; hence\r\nsuch tests as mineralogical texture supplies can seldom be relied\r\non to determine the age of rocks. We can prove, for example, that a\r\nseries of limestones in England may be identical in age with a set of\r\nsandstones in Sweden, and with a group of shales in America, because\r\nthey all contain the same or representative genera and species of\r\norganic remains. They occupy the same position in the geological scale;\r\nthat is, the animals whose fossilized remains lie buried in these rocks\r\nwere all living at the same time, while lime was gathering at the\r\nsea-bottom over the site of part of England, and sand was being thrown\r\ndown upon a portion of what is now Sweden, and mud was accumulating\r\nover a submerged area of America. In such cases the differences of\r\nmineralogical character go for nothing in determining the age of the\r\nrocks; we have to rely solely on the embedded fossils, and on the order\r\nof superposition.\r\n\r\nKeeping in view, then, that the formations into which the geologist\r\nhas grouped the stratified portion of the earth's crust have a settled\r\nand invariable order of occurrence, that each of them contains its own\r\npeculiar and characteristic group of organic remains whereby it can\r\nbe recognised in any part of the world, and that such remains form\r\noften the sole test at once of the geologic age and of the origin of\r\nthe rocks wherein they lie, we may return to the plan above proposed\r\nand endeavour to understand the structure of a coal-field. For this\r\npurpose it may be well to select one of the northern coal-fields of\r\nBritain, since these perhaps display a greater variety in their organic\r\ncontents, and bear evidence of more diversified changes in their mode\r\nof formation than can be seen in those of the south. The strata that\r\ncompose the coal-basin of Mid-Lothian will probably best suit our\r\npurpose, as they are free from the disturbing effects of those igneous\r\nintrusions which play so important a part among similar rocks to the\r\nnorth and west.\r\n\r\nThe Mid-Lothian coal-field comprises a mass of stratified beds of\r\nsandstone, shale, coal, ironstone, and limestone, the united depth of\r\nthe whole being above 3000 feet. By reference to the annexed Table it\r\nwill be seen that the lowest beds of the section are chiefly sandstones\r\nand shales, extending downwards to an unknown depth, without any coal\r\nthat can be profitably worked. These under-strata form the Lower\r\nCarboniferous group. Above them comes a middle zone in which the\r\ncharacteristic beds are of limestone, comprising the middle portion or\r\nMountain Limestone of the Scottish Carboniferous rocks. The third and\r\nhighest subdivision forms the Upper Carboniferous group or true Coal\r\nMeasures, and constitutes the whole of what is properly the Mid-Lothian\r\ncoal-field. For the sake of noting some of the remarkable changes\r\nexhibited in the character of the rocks, it may be well to begin our\r\nsurvey among the upper beds of the under group. Let us take as our base\r\nthe famous limestone of Burdiehouse, and work our way upward through\r\nthe four thousand feet of strata that lie piled above it.\r\n\r\n\r\nVERTICAL SECTION OF THE MID-LOTHIAN COAL-FIELD.\r\n\r\n  UPPER CARBONIFEROUS\r\n    OR COAL-MEASURES.\r\n    /                      / |         | A series of sandstones, shales,\r\n    |                      | |         |  and fire-clays, with interbedded\r\n    | =Flat Coal Group.=  /  |         |  seams of coal occupying the\r\n    | (Above 1000 feet.)  \\  |         |  central area of Mid-Lothian\r\n    |                      | |         |  coal-field.\r\n    |                      \\ |         |\r\n    |                        |—————————|\r\n    |                      / |         |\r\n    |                      | |         |\r\n    |                      | |         | A great series of sandstones\r\n    |                      | |         |  and shales with three seams of\r\n   /  =Roslyn Sandstone   /  |         |  marine limestone (marked here\r\n   \\       Group.=         \\  |·········|  by dotted lines), With the\r\n    | (About 1500 feet.)   | |         |  exception of one or two thin seams\r\n    |                      | |·········|  it contains no coal, and serves in\r\n    |                      | |         |  this way to mark off the coal-\r\n    |                      | |         |  bearing beds above from the still\r\n    |                      | |         |  richer coal-bearing beds below.\r\n    |                      \\ |·········|\r\n    |                        |—————————|\r\n    |                      / |         |\r\n    |                      | |         | A group of sandstones and\r\n    | =Edge Coal Group.=  /  |         |  shales similar to those at the\r\n    \\  (800-900 feet.)    \\  |         |  top, and like them abounding in\r\n                           | |         |  coal seams, some of which are\r\n                           \\ |         |  thick and valuable.\r\n  ————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————\r\n  CARBONIFEROUS LIMESTONES.  |         |\r\n    /   =Roman Camp        / |         | A set of marine limestones\r\n    |    Limestones.=      | |         |  intercalated with sandstones,\r\n    \\  (150-200 feet.)     \\ |         |  shales, and a few seams of coal.\r\n  ————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————\r\n  LOWER  CARBONIFEROUS.      |         |\r\n    /                        |         |\r\n    |                        |         |\r\n    |    =Burdiehouse      / |         | Sandstones and shales extending\r\n    |      Limestone.=     | |·········|  to an unknown depth, often\r\n    |      (27 feet.)      \\ |         |  with seams of dull-grey compact\r\n   /                         |         |  limestone, rarely of coal.

It is Crowded with\r\nfossils, every fragment when taken up showing its seed-cone, fern-stem,\r\nfish-scale, or minute _cyprides_. All the plants seem to belong to\r\nterrestrial species, and have a broken and often a macerated look.\r\nManifestly they never grew where we now find their remains; they must\r\nhave come drifting down from swamp, or jungle, or hill-side. And so\r\nwe come to know that during the later ages of the Lower Carboniferous\r\nperiod, there lay somewhere in the neighbourhood of Burdiehouse a land\r\nclothed with ferns and club-mosses, and through whose swampy hollows\r\nthere spread a network of stigmariæ, while sigillariæ waved their\r\nfronds high overhead. From what has been said on a previous page we may\r\ninfer that the climate of the old land was moist and equable like that\r\nof New Zealand, nourishing a prolific growth of ferns and other plants\r\ncomparatively low in the botanical scale. The scenery of the vegetation\r\ndisplayed perhaps no great variety of outline, but exhibited rather an\r\nendless succession of the same graceful forms.\r\n\r\nBut the limestone presents us with other remains than merely those of\r\nterrestrial plants. It displays in abundance the minute dissevered\r\ncases of _cypris_, the small crustaceous animal described above.\r\nRecent species of this genus inhabit stagnant ponds or the bottoms of\r\ngently-flowing rivers, and we hence infer that the ancient species must\r\nin like manner have possessed a similar habitat, and consequently that\r\nthe rocks which preserve their remains must have been deposited in\r\nfresh (or, perhaps, brackish) water. Tried by this test the Burdiehouse\r\nlimestone must be regarded as a lacustrine, or more probably a\r\nfluviatile formation, which gathered slowly on an undisturbed bottom\r\nswarming with crustaceans and plentifully covered with leaves,\r\nbranches, rootlets, and other fragments of terrestrial plants brought\r\ndown by streams from the adjoining land. Thus the inferences drawn from\r\nthe numerous plants, and from the countless multitude of cypris-cases,\r\ncome to be mutually corroborative. The former tell us of some\r\nneighbouring forest-covered country; the latter lead us, as it were,\r\ninto its river-mouths, whence we can descry the waving woods on either\r\nside.\r\n\r\nStill we have not exhausted all the fossil remains of the Burdiehouse\r\nrocks. Mingled among the stems of ferns and lepidodendra, and the\r\nscattered valves of the cyprides, lie the scales, teeth, and bones,\r\nof several large ganoidal fishes, along with entire specimens of the\r\nsmaller genera. The scales of holoptychius are especially abundant,\r\noften crowded together by dozens, and probably not far out of the\r\narrangement they had when grouped on the body of the living animal.\r\nDetached teeth of the same fish also frequently occur along with\r\ndisjointed internal bones. The remains of the contemporary megalichthys\r\nlikewise abound, more particularly the scales, which have a fine\r\nnut-brown colour, and dot the surface of the rock with their bright\r\nglittering enamel. Several other smaller ganoids may be met with,\r\nespecially a small and elegant species of Palæoniscus (_P. Robisoni_),\r\nand one of Eurynotus, a fish remarkable for the great size of its\r\ndorsal fin. Not uncommon, too, are the ichthyodoralites of a gigantic\r\nplacoid--the _Gyracanthus formosus_--with all their delicately-fretted\r\nornament and a peculiar crystalline glistening surface when broken\r\nacross, whereby the smallest fragment can be easily distinguished from\r\nany other bone in the limestone. Such are the ichthyic remains of the\r\nBurdiehouse beds; what deductions can be legitimately drawn from them?\r\n\r\nAs before, we must have recourse to the analogy of living nature. The\r\nexisting ganoidal fishes chiefly inhabit lakes and rivers, especially\r\nnear the confluence of the latter with the ocean. They feed on\r\nthe decaying matter brought down from the land, or on the minute\r\nCrustacea that swarm upon the river-bottom. If, as seems probable,\r\nthe ancient ganoids had habits similar to those of their present\r\nrepresentatives, then the rocks wherein their remains occur abundantly\r\nmay have originated on river-bottoms, and such may have been the case\r\nat Burdiehouse. So that here again we have corroborative evidence\r\nof the fluviatile origin of the limestone in question. But besides\r\nthe remains of ganoidal fishes there occur the defensive spines of\r\nplacoids. Now, the placoids are emphatically marine fishes, and the\r\nsole living representative of the most ancient genera of this order\r\nis the Port-Jackson shark, that haunts the seas round Australia. The\r\nichthyodorulites of Burdiehouse, therefore, if we would apply analogy\r\nconsistently, must be regarded as the relics of marine species. And\r\nthis conclusion, too, will be found in entire harmony with those\r\nalready obtained, for if we are right in assuming the Burdiehouse\r\nstrata to have originated at a river-bottom, particularly near the sea,\r\nwe may expect to find the remains of marine predaceous fishes imbedded\r\nin the sediment that gathered there, just as the teeth of the shark may\r\nbe preserved among the mud forming in the upper reaches of many British\r\nestuaries, seeing that not a few instances are known where that fish\r\nhas been stranded on such shores as those of the higher parts of the\r\nFirth of Forth. These Burdiehouse ichthyodorulites give positive proof\r\nthat the limestone could not have originated in a lake, and the only\r\nexplanation left is that of a river-bottom.\r\n\r\nBut it may perhaps be objected that, after all, these fish-remains\r\nare for the most part fragmentary, and may consequently be drifted\r\nspecimens, so that no conclusion as to the source of the rock can be\r\nbased on their occurrence there. The imbedded land-plants confessedly\r\ncame from some distance, why may not the same have been the case with\r\nthe bones and scales of the river-haunting ganoid fishes? And, indeed,\r\ndid we regard these fish-bones and scales merely in themselves, the\r\nargument might not perhaps be very easily answered, although the great\r\nnumbers and perfect outline of the bones, teeth, and scales, afford\r\npretty strong evidence that the owners lived and died in the locality\r\nwhere their remains are found. But there is a curious kind of evidence\r\nto be gleaned from the rocks around them whereby this objection can be\r\nat once set aside. In the limestone itself, and especially in some of\r\nthe shales above, there occur vast numbers of small oblong coprolitic\r\nconcretions of a dirty yellow or brown colour, full of scales and\r\nfragments of bone. There can be no doubt that these are the excremental\r\nremains of predaceous animals, while their great number and perfect\r\npreservation assure us that they could not have been drifted from a\r\ndistance, but must rather have been deposited on the spot where we now\r\nfind them. And thus we conclude that the site of Burdiehouse must have\r\nbeen a favourite haunt of these bone-covered fishes; that the bulkier\r\nforms, armed with pointed teeth or barbed-spines, preyed upon their\r\nhumbler congeners, while these in turn may have fed on the cyprides\r\nthat swarmed by millions at the bottom of the estuary. I have often\r\ndetected in these coprolites the peculiarly-sculptured scales of the\r\npalæoniscus. These graceful little animals must, therefore, have died\r\nthat their lordlier brethren might dine.\r\n\r\nOn a survey, then, of the whole evidence from fossils, we are led to\r\nconclude that the Burdiehouse limestone was slowly elaborated at the\r\nbottom of an estuary, into which the remains of terrestrial plants were\r\ndrifted from the land, while bone-covered fishes haunted the waters,\r\nand into these busy scenes huge sharks ascended from the sea to share\r\nin the decaying putrescent matter ever brought down from the interior.\r\n\r\nThe upper part of the limestone is shaly and argillaceous, and rests\r\nbelow a series of shales and thin sandstones. If the question were\r\nasked, what caused the change from limestone to shale, from the\r\ndeposition of a calcareous to that of a muddy sediment, several\r\nanswers might be given. The most probable seems to be the following.\r\nThe limestone on weathered surfaces displays the mouldering casts of\r\ncypris-cases sometimes in such abundance as to show that the rock must\r\nbe largely made up of them. The cyprides of the present day probably\r\ncast their shells annually; the integuments thus thrown off forming\r\nunder favourable circumstances a thin mouldering calcareous marl at\r\nthe bottom of the pond or marsh, along with the decaying shells of\r\n_paludina_, _planorbis_, _limnea_, or other fresh-water molluscs. We\r\nmay conceive the Burdiehouse limestone to have had a similar origin.\r\nThe cyprides, inhabiting water that contained little argillaceous\r\nmatter, must have propagated by myriads, and during a long period of\r\nrepose, in which the conditions of land and sea, and the directions of\r\ntidal currents and river-courses, appear not to have greatly varied\r\nin the neighbourhood of Burdiehouse, the calcareous exuviæ of these\r\nminute animals, along perhaps with the remains of other estuarine or\r\nfluviatile organisms,[60] would form each year a scarce appreciable\r\nstratum, until by slow aggregation a bed twenty-seven feet deep was\r\nelaborated. Each successive annual layer would hardly settle down more\r\nperceptibly or more rapidly than \"the flickering dust that mottles the\r\nfloor of some old haunted chamber.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 60: Though I have never observed molluscan remains in the\r\nlimestone of Burdiehouse, they are abundant twelve miles to the west,\r\nin the equivalent strata around Mid-Calder, one little gastropod\r\nbeing especially plentiful near the base of the calcareous rock in a\r\nseam known to the quarrymen as the \"Buckie fake.\" I have not met with\r\nspecimens sufficiently perfect for identification, the hard splintery\r\nnature of the rock seldom allowing anything but a cross-section to be\r\nseen save on weathered specimens, where the general contour of the\r\nshells has sometimes reminded me of _Paludina multiformis_ grouped\r\ntogether in a recent fresh-water marl. In the shales above the\r\nBurdiehouse limestone, Dr Hibbert states he found a _unio_ (?), called\r\nby him _U. nuciformis_. _Trans. Roy. Soc. Edin._ vol. xiii. p. 245.]\r\n\r\nAt last, however, this condition of things came to be modified. The\r\ndirection of the river channel along some part of its course had\r\nvaried, or some analogous change had taken place, so that muddy\r\nsediment transported from the land sank down amid the cyprides at\r\nthe bottom. In circumstances so uncongenial these tiny denizens\r\nof the estuary diminished in numbers until the silt and sand came\r\ndown so rapidly and in such abundance that they eventually died out.\r\nAlluvial matter still darkened the water and covered the river-bottom,\r\nenveloping now the fronds of a delicate fern that had waved along\r\nthe margin of some sequestered lake far inland, anon a seed-cone\r\nthat had been shaken by the breeze from the spiky branches of some\r\ntall club-moss. Among these muddy beds occur numerous coprolites and\r\nfish-scales, along with cypriscases and a few shells of unio (?),\r\nshowing that though the cyprides were decreasing, the water still\r\npresented the old estuary conditions and still swarmed with life.\r\n\r\nEventually there came other changes in the direction or rapidity of\r\nriver currents, and the accumulations of mud and silt were succeeded by\r\na long protracted deposition of yellow sand, now forming the sandstone\r\nof Straiton. It enclosed many stems of stigmaria, lepidodendron, &c.,\r\nand in certain limited areas these plants matted together in such\r\nquantities that their remains now form thin irregular seams of coal.\r\nIt would appear, therefore, that notwithstanding these changes in the\r\nmatter transported and deposited at the locality in question, the\r\nestuary character of the locality remained essentially the same. The\r\nsand was at length replaced by fresh accumulations of mud and sandy\r\nsilt, which went to form the beds of shale and shaly sandstone now\r\nfound above the Straiton rock.\r\n\r\nWhen in the course of many long centuries a depth of strata amounting\r\nto fully 300 feet had been amassed, the area of Mid-Lothian underwent\r\na total change. Owing to a depression of the earth's crust, that seems\r\nto have been general over the whole of central Scotland, the estuary\r\nin which the Burdiehouse limestone and superincumbent strata were\r\ndeposited became open sea. As the evidence of this change rests solely\r\non the character of the imbedded organic remains, we shall pursue our\r\ninduction by examining the beds somewhat in detail.\r\n\r\nRather more than 300 feet above the limestone of Burdiehouse there\r\noccurs in the Mid-Lothian coal-field a series of shales and seams\r\nof limestone. The former are sometimes black and hard, sometimes\r\nbluish-grey, soft, and frequently imbedding the remains of several\r\ngenera of mollusca and other organic remains. The limestones vary\r\nconsiderably in the thickness and general aspect of their several\r\nseams, some being highly crystallized and about two or three feet in\r\ndepth, others dull, compact, and ranging up to twenty and thirty feet\r\nthick. The shales and limestones are intercalated with and sometimes\r\npass into each other, through the gradations of shaly limestone and\r\ncalcareous shales. The whole series may measure 150 to 200 feet,\r\nresting on the Straiton sandstone below, and passing upwards into\r\nthe under part of the coal-bearing strata of Mid-Lothian known as\r\nthe _Edge series_. These limestones form the northern _marine_\r\nequivalents of the mountain limestone of England, while the sandstones\r\nand shales on which they rest, including the Burdiehouse beds and\r\nall the Lower Carboniferous group, must probably be regarded as\r\n_estuarine_ equivalents of the same formation. That is to say, while\r\nmarine limestones were accumulating over the site of central England,\r\nsandstone, shale, and drifted plants, were slowly gathering in a wide\r\nestuary over what is now central Scotland, and only at the close of the\r\nperiod did marine limestones form simultaneously at both localities.\r\n\r\nIn examining these Mid-Lothian beds we are struck at once with the\r\ngreat dissimilarity that obtains between their organic remains and\r\nthose of the underlying strata. All the land-plants disappear--ferns,\r\nlepidodendra, sigillariæ, and stigmariæ. The cyprides, too, no longer\r\noccur, though the shales seem, at a first glance, to differ in no\r\nrespect from those underneath, in some of which the cypris-cases were\r\nseen to abound. Neither can we detect the glittering scales and teeth\r\nthat stood out in such strong relief upon the rocks below. Yet the\r\nfossils are scarcely less numerous than they were in the lower beds.\r\nNay, in some of the limestones they lie so crowded together that the\r\nrock seems entirely made up of them. Plainly such a total renovation\r\nof organic life points to some equally extensive change of a physical\r\nkind. Let us examine for a little some of the fossil remains occurring\r\nin the mountain limestone series of Mid-Lothian, and read off, if we\r\ncan, the revolutions which they chronicle.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 32.--Section from Gilmerton to Crichton; _a_, Lower\r\nCarboniferous; _b_, Mountain Limestone; _c_, Edge Series; _d_, Roslyn\r\nSandstone Group; _e_, Flat Coals; _y_, Drift.]\r\n\r\nThe neighbourhood of Edinburgh affords many facilities for the study of\r\nthese rocks. They can be seen, for instance, at many points along the\r\nridge of the Roman Camp Hill, near Dalkeith, exposed in the operations\r\nof quarrying. That ridge is formed by what is known technically as\r\nan anticlinal axis (Fig. 32); in other words, the lower beds of the\r\ncoal-measures rise up here into a sort of broad wave-like undulation,\r\nround the sides of which the higher parts of the series are folded. The\r\nelevated area has either been pushed up from below, or the more level\r\ncountry around has subsided into two trough-like hollows, so that now\r\nthe strata, which geologically speaking are lowest, come to occupy the\r\nhighest ground in the district. Seated on some of the opener spots\r\nof this woody eminence the observer has a noble prospect on which to\r\nexpatiate. The ground around him is rich in historic associations,\r\nand links itself to many a varied page in the annals of Scotland. The\r\nhill on which he rests is crowned by the mouldering mounds of what\r\ntradition reports to have been a Roman station, but which may perhaps\r\nbelong to a still earlier era. A few hundred yards north rise the\r\nwooded slopes of Carberry Hill, where the hapless Mary surrendered to\r\nher rebel lords, and whence she was led into her own capital amid the\r\ninsults of an infuriate rabble. Northward, too, lies the fatal field\r\nof Pinkie, and eastward the less deadly but not less decisive field\r\nof Prestonpans. To the west the eye can mark the grey smoke of the\r\nScottish metropolis, with its dusky towers and its lion-shaped hill,\r\nand then the blue waving outline of the Pentlands that sweep away\r\nsouth and lose themselves among the distant hills which girdle in the\r\ncoal-basin of Edinburgh and Haddington. The course of the Esk--that\r\n_fabulosus amnis_--passes by many a time-honoured spot, from Habbie's\r\nHowe and the scene of the Gentle Shepherd down by the haunted scenery\r\nof Roslyn, the cliffs of Hawthornden, the grounds of Newbattle, and\r\nthe old Roman station of Inveresk. East, west, and south, the broad\r\nexpanse of green field and clustering wood swells upward to the distant\r\nhills that encircle the landscape with a wavy line of softest blue.\r\nNorthward the eye rests on the Firth of Forth with its solitary sails,\r\nbounded by the bosky heights of Fife, and opening outwards by the May\r\nIsland and the Bass Rock into the far-off hazy ocean. On every side\r\nobjects of historic interest lie crowded together, about which many\r\npleasant volumes have been and might still be written. If the observer\r\nbe a lover of geological science he will find an examination of the\r\nstructure of the hill to impart an additional interest to the scene.\r\nFrom the wide panorama of hill and dale, river and sea, with all its\r\nbattle-fields, castles, and abbeys, and all its memories of the olden\r\ntime, let him turn into one of the quarries that indent the flanks\r\nof the hill, and try to decipher there the records of a still older\r\nhistory. An hour or two thus spent will pass swiftly and pleasantly\r\naway, and on quitting the quarry he will have gained a new light in\r\nwhich to look on the landscape that lies spread out below.\r\n\r\nThe mountain limestone of Mid-Lothian consists, as has been mentioned,\r\nof several seams interbedded with black and calcareous shales. The\r\nquarries on Roman Camp Hill have been opened in several of the thickest\r\nof these seams. Let us enter one of the excavations. A vertical face\r\nof rock forms the background, overhung above by long dangling tufts of\r\nwithered grass, and washed below by a pool of water having that milky\r\ngreen tint peculiar to old lime-quarries. The lowest rock visible is\r\na dull grey limestone with a yellowish weathered surface. Above it\r\nrests a mass of hard yellow calcareous shale, known to the workmen\r\nas \"bands.\" This rock is worthless as a source of lime, nor from its\r\nirregular laminations and shivery structure has it much value in any\r\nother way. A few inches of surface-soil form the upper part of the\r\nsection. It requires but a glance over the weathered surface of the\r\nlimestone to mark that the rock abounds in fossils. Of these by far\r\nthe most numerous are the joints of the stone-lily, for the most part\r\nof small size, and when broken across, with their minute central\r\napertures, looking like so many fractured stems of tobacco-pipes. Other\r\norganisms also occur, such as a small delicately-plaited productus,\r\na larger and more boldly-ribbed spirifer, a small cyathophyllum or\r\ncup-coral, and the fragile interlacing meshes of one of the net-like\r\nbryozoa--the fenestella. Of rarer occurrence are the whorled shells\r\ncalled bellerophon, the long chambered shells of orthoceratites, and\r\nthe grooved tapering shells of pinnæ. Many of the same fossils can be\r\ndetected in the beds above, which thus evidently all form part of one\r\nseries with the rock below. What, then, were the circumstances under\r\nwhich these strata originated?\r\n\r\nThe answer to such a question is not far to seek. The corals and\r\ncrinoids are exclusively marine families, and so any stratum in which\r\ntheir remains occur must have had a submarine origin. It matters not\r\nin this case though the specimens be fragmentary, showing a broken and\r\ndrifted appearance. For even supposing that they did not live at the\r\nspot where their petrified relics are now exhumed by the operations of\r\nthe quarryman, granting that they were drifted from a distance, still\r\nthey could only have been drifted from one part of the sea-bottom to\r\nanother. The state of keeping of the specimen often tells vastly on the\r\nvalue of its evidence when it belongs to a land or fresh-water tribe.\r\nThus, in one of the limestones of West-Lothian I have found a black\r\ncarbonized stem of sigillaria. Now, the sigillaria was a land-plant\r\nas much as any of our hazels or willows, and where the evidence from\r\nthe associated organisms coincides, furnishes its own testimony as\r\nto the origin of the rock which imbeds its remains. But the stem in\r\nquestion was a mere fragment, and showed moreover a worn macerated\r\nsurface. Such a fossil had evidently no value as a test of the origin\r\nof the limestone, which might have been elaborated either in an inland\r\nlake or in open sea. That it had really a marine origin, and that the\r\nsigillaria actually was, as it seemed to have been, a drifted plant,\r\nI ascertained beyond a doubt by detecting on the same slab hundreds\r\nof encrinal stems along with the shells, and thin, delicate, silvery\r\nspines of productus. Thus, then, the organisms of the land may be\r\ncarried into the sea, and in dealing with their fossilized remains\r\nin the deposits of former ages we must be very careful in the use of\r\nevidence derived from fragmentary and drifted specimens. But no such\r\ncaution is needed in regard to the productions of the sea. If they be\r\nfragmentary and drifted, we may believe they were rolled about by tides\r\nand currents previous to their final entombment; but still they remain\r\nas good a test as ever of the marine character of the rock in which\r\nthey occur.[61]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 61: The exceptional instance, of the accumulation on the land\r\nof blown sand imbedding the broken remains of marine shells, needs only\r\nto be noticed here.]\r\n\r\nThe fossils of Roman Camp Hill are not drifted specimens. They must\r\nhave lived and died where the quarryman now finds them. We recognise\r\nthem as all unequivocally marine; corals, crinoids, and brachiopodous\r\nmolluscs, are all clearly the denizens of the sea, and hence we\r\nconclude that they mark the site of an ancient ocean. The snail-shells\r\nthat swarm about the fruit-trees of our orchards not more unmistakably\r\nindicate a land-surface than do these petrified relics evidence an old\r\nsea-bottom. We can argue, too, from the crowded way in which they lie\r\ngrouped together, that life must have been prolific in these primeval\r\nwaters. Every fragment of the rock shows its dozens, nay, hundreds,\r\nof stone-lily joints, disjointed indeed, yet easily recognisable.\r\nThey must have swarmed as thickly along the floor of the sea as the\r\nstrong-stemmed tangle that darkens the bottom of many a picturesque\r\nbay along our western coasts, yet with a gracefulness of outline such\r\nas none of our larger sea-weeds can boast. Less numerous but not less\r\nmarkedly _in situ_ are the shells of productus and spirifer, the former\r\nwith its finely-striated surface fresh as if the creature had died but\r\nyesterday, while the slender spines with which it was armed lie strewed\r\naround. In short, the whole suite of organisms points to a period of\r\ntranquil deposition in a sea of probably no great depth, where the\r\nlower forms of the animal kingdom flourished in abundance, contributing\r\nby their calcareous secretions to form continuous layers of limestone.\r\n\r\nSuch a condition of things finds a parallel in many parts of the globe\r\nat the present day. Thus, the shores of the islands of the Pacific\r\nare white with fine calcareous mud, that results from the action\r\nof breakers on the surrounding coral-reefs. This mud, enveloping\r\nfragments of coral, shells, sea-weed, drift-wood, and other extraneous\r\nsubstances, hardens on exposure, and becomes eventually a limestone,\r\ntravertine, or calc-sinter. We may believe that the same process goes\r\non out at sea, around the edges of atolls or circular coral-reefs,\r\nand that the sediment thus thrown down will enclose any zoophytes\r\nor molluscan remains that may lie at the sea-bottom, along perhaps\r\nwith _fuci_, and occasional water-logged fragments of wood that have\r\nbeen drifted from land. Along the shores of Guadaloupe a bed of this\r\ncalcareous silt has formed since America was colonized by man, for it\r\nhas been found to contain fragments of pottery, arrow-heads, and other\r\narticles of human workmanship.[62] The same rock has yielded, besides,\r\nthe partially-petrified bones of several human skeletons, one of which,\r\nthough without the head, forms a prominent object among the fossil\r\ntreasures of the British Museum. The rock in which these remains are\r\nembedded is described as harder than statuary marble, notwithstanding\r\nits recent origin. By supposing the same process to be carried on over\r\na large area and for a long period, we may see how a continuous stratum\r\nof limestone could be elaborated, full of fossil relics of corals,\r\nmolluscs, and other marine productions. And in some such way, we may\r\nbe permitted to believe, the seams of limestone on Roman Camp Hill\r\nwere accumulated. The billows of that old carboniferous ocean may not\r\nhave sent up their white surf against the margin of snowy coral-reefs,\r\nbut the currents below did their work of demolition as effectually,\r\nand by sweeping through the submarine groves of stone-lilies and\r\ncup-corals, as the night winds of autumn sweep athwart the heavy-laden\r\nfields, would prostrate many a full-grown stem and scatter its\r\nloosened joints among the thickening lime that covered the bottom.\r\nStone-lily, cup-coral, net-coral, productus, spirifer, pinna, nautilus,\r\northoceratite, all would eventually be entombed amid the decaying\r\nremains of their congeners, and thus produce a slowly-increasing seam\r\nof limestone.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 62: Lyell's _Manual of Elementary Geology_, p. 121. Fifth\r\nedition.]\r\n\r\nWe still linger in the old quarry on Roman Camp Hill, but the day\r\ndraws rapidly to a close, and the long level beams of the setting sun\r\nlighten up the higher grounds with a golden flush, while the valley\r\nbelow lies deep in shade. The rays fall brightly on the abrupt face of\r\nlimestone at the further end of the quarry, every prominence standing\r\nout in bold relief, and casting its shadow far behind. Our eye, in\r\npassing over the sunlit rock, can detect the fractured joint of many an\r\nencrinite glancing in the light; along, too, with the strongly defined\r\noutlines of some of the lesser and more abundant molluscs--spirifers\r\nor producti. Some of them, sorely effaced by the rains, have begun\r\nto yield a scanty nestling place for creeping fibres of moss; others\r\nyet bare, afford a rest to the _Vanessa_ whereon to spread its wings\r\nin the mellow sunset ere flitting homewards among the dewy herbage.\r\nThe bushes overhead scarcely rustle in the light-breathing air that\r\ncomes fitfully across the land, and the long grass nods dreamily on\r\nthe margin of the pool below. There rests a calm stillness on all the\r\nnearer landscape, and the distant ground blends away into the shades\r\nof evening. The scene, in short, has about it that solemn impressive\r\nrepose which irresistibly arrests the fancy, and sets it to dress up\r\ninto fantastic shapes the massive clouds that float in the western\r\nsky, to picture grim forms amid the misty shadows of the valley, or to\r\ndwell half dreaming upon the memories of the past, that come crowding\r\nthrough the mind in quick succession. Our labours among the fossils of\r\nthe old quarry, however, enable fancy to draw her stores from another\r\nsource. We muse on these petrified relics, gilded by the last rays\r\nof the setting sun, when slowly, like a dissolving view, sunset and\r\nherbage melt away, and the bottom of the old carboniferous ocean lies\r\nbefore us with its corals and shells and stone-lilies, stretching out\r\ntheir quivering arms, or expanding and contracting their flower-like\r\npetals amid a scene of ceaseless animation and activity. Geology\r\ndelights in contrasts, and assuredly the contrast presented to us this\r\nevening between the present and the past of Roman Camp Hill, will not\r\nrank among the least striking of those which she has to reveal. There\r\nis now spread over us the blue sky, richly hung with tinted clouds,\r\nand melodious with the evening songs of the lark, the blackbird, and\r\nthe thrush. Not less surely did a wide expanse of sea during the\r\nCarboniferous era roll over the hill on which we stand. And yonder\r\nsilvery moon that mounts up amid the violet twilight of the east, has\r\nwitnessed each scene and all the countless changes that have intervened\r\nbetween them. The same pale light that now begins to steal through the\r\nwoods and athwart the fields, must have streamed down upon that old\r\nsea and illumined its green depths. Oceans and continents, islands and\r\nlakes, hills and valleys, have come and gone with all their successive\r\nraces of living things, and that same planet has marked them all. She\r\nhas seen, too, as but a thing of yesterday, the appearance of man upon\r\nthe scene, with all the successive centuries that have elapsed since\r\nthen. Truly the \"goddess of the silver bow\" would have a strange story\r\nto tell us could we interrogate her about the past. But the days of\r\nEndymion have gone by, and she now no longer visits in a personal form\r\nthe seat of beings who gaze at her crescent orb and daringly pronounce\r\nit a scene of blasted ruin and desolation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Intercalation of coal seams among mountain limestone beds of\r\n       Mid-Loihian--North Greens seam--Most of our coal seams\r\n       indicate former land-surfaces--Origin of coal a debated\r\n       question--Erect fossil trees in coal-measures--Deductions to\r\n       be drawn therefrom--Difference between the mountain limestone\r\n       of Scotland and that of England--Coal-bearing character of the\r\n       northern series--Divisions of the Mid-Lothian coal-field--The\r\n       Edge coals--Their origin illustrated by the growth of modern\r\n       deltas--Delta of the Nile--Of the Mississippi--Of the\r\n       Ganges--Progress of formation of the Edge coals--Scenery\r\n       of the period like that of modern deltas--Calculations of\r\n       the time required for the growth of a coal-field--Why of\r\n       doubtful value--Roslyn Sandstone group--Affords proofs of\r\n       a general and more rapid subsidence beneath the sea--Its\r\n       great continuity--Probable origin--Flat coals--Similar\r\n       in origin to the Edge coals below--Their series not now\r\n       complete--Recapitulation of the general changes indicated by\r\n       the Mid-Lothian coal-field.\r\n\r\nAmong the old quarries of Roman Camp Hill and down the course of\r\nseveral streams in the same county, the limestone beds of the mountain\r\nlimestone series are seen to be associated with strata of shale, some\r\nof which are highly calcareous, and charged with the same organic\r\nremains that occur in the limestones. Such shaly intercalations mark\r\nas before the transport and deposition of muddy sediment around and\r\nabove the corals and stone-lilies of the sea-bottom. All these beds\r\nmust undoubtedly be regarded as marine. But there occur, besides,\r\nseams of sandstone and black partially-bituminous shale, with layers\r\nof coal and fire-clay. To this singular intermixture it may be well\r\nto advert more particularly, since it forms one of the distinguishing\r\nfeatures of these northern rocks, as contrasted with those of central\r\nand south-western England, and more especially since it will lead us\r\nto mark again the value of fossil remains as evidence of the ancient\r\nchanges of land and sea.\r\n\r\nThe southern part of Mid-Lothian consists of a broad heathy moorland,\r\nthat slopes northward into the more cultivated country, and swells\r\nupward to the south into the series of undulating ridges that form the\r\nMoorfoot Hills. It is traversed by several streams which rise high\r\namong the pasture grounds of the south, and flow some into the valley\r\nof the Esk, and thence into the sea at Musselburgh; others past the\r\nancient fortalices of Borthwick and Crichton, and so by the valley of\r\nthe Tyne into the sea at Tyningham. In their upper course they traverse\r\na broad belt of the mountain limestone that stretches across this\r\npart of the country from east to west, and dips away north under the\r\ncoal-field. Where the streams have been able to cut through the thick\r\nmantle of heath, sand, gravel, and clay, by which these higher grounds\r\nare covered, we sometimes obtain a complete section of the strata\r\ndisplayed in regular sequence along the bottom of the channels. Thus,\r\none of the rivulets that trickles slowly through the swampy ground of\r\nMiddleton Muir, on approaching the line of limestone begins to descend\r\nmore rapidly, and has excavated its course through several feet of the\r\nrock below. The limestones are well exposed along each side of the\r\nstream, forming in some places steep walls tapestried with moss and\r\noverhung with scraggy furze, and offering to the student an instructive\r\nseries of sections. Near the farm of Esperston, where the stream flows\r\nthrough a narrow secluded valley, the limestones form a floor which the\r\nwater in the course of centuries has worn smooth, so that the rock with\r\nits included encrinal stems and shells, polished by the ceaseless flow\r\nof the current, shows like a sheet of variegated marble. At one point\r\non the side of the water-course the observer may notice a low ledge\r\nof rock jutting out for a short way along the edge of the stream. The\r\nupper part is a hard compact limestone, full of small crinoidal joints.\r\nThe bed underneath it has been greatly eroded by the rivulet, but\r\nenough remains to show that the stratum is one of coal. It rests upon\r\nthe series of limestones and sandstones seen in the upper part of the\r\nwater-course, and is surmounted by the thick limestones of Arniston and\r\nMiddleton. A similar seam nineteen inches thick has been worked among\r\nthe limestone about three miles to the west at Fountain. The same bed\r\noccurs among the quarries on Roman Camp Hill already mentioned, and I\r\nhave seen an equivalent stratum intercalated among sheets of cup-corals\r\nand stone-lilies on the shore at Aberlady, where the waves have laid\r\nopen perhaps the finest section of Carboniferous limestone strata in\r\nScotland. In West-Lothian, too, the same intercalation of coal-seams\r\namong the mountain limestone beds can be seen in many places. Thus, in\r\nthe bed of the River Almond, near Blackburn, the following section is\r\nlaid bare:--\r\n\r\n  Calcareous shale.\r\n  Limestone (marine), eight feet.\r\n  Calcareous shale, with _spirifers_, &c.\r\n  Coal, six to eight inches.\r\n  Fire-clay.\r\n  Sandstone.\r\n\r\nA short way further down the stream another bed of limestone occurs\r\nwith several seams of coal below it, one of them attaining a thickness\r\nof six feet.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the thin seam at Esperston, the Mid-Lothian field\r\ncontains several others. Of these by much the most important is that\r\nknown as the North Greens Seam. It varies in thickness from only a\r\nfew inches to fully 5 feet, and has been extensively worked for the\r\n_parrot_ or gas-coal which it contains. It rests upon a pavement of\r\nshale, sometimes of fire-clay, and occurs about midway between two\r\nthick marine limestones, being from 80 to 90 feet distant from each.\r\nI have laid open many a block of the parrot-coal at the pit mouth,\r\nand marked the well-defined outlines of the stigmaria covered with a\r\nyellowish efflorescence of iron pyrites, like gilded figures upon\r\na black velvet ground. The plants lie with their divergent rootlets\r\nspread out regularly along the stem like teeth on the back of a comb,\r\nthus seeming to indicate no hurried agglomeration by some tidal wave or\r\nturbid river, but rather a slow and tranquil deposition.\r\n\r\nThe fossils of the coal-seams consist for the most part of the\r\nplants above described, which we saw to belong to _terrestrial\r\nspecies_. But the reader will now understand that in dealing with\r\norganic remains we cannot infer, because a certain stratum contains\r\nnothing but land-plants, that it must necessarily by consequence be a\r\nland-formation. For we have seen that the plants of the Burdiehouse\r\nlimestone, though all terrestrial, gave no support to the idea that the\r\nrock had originated on land. In all such cases regard must be had not\r\nonly to the nature of the imbedded organisms, but their condition and\r\nmode of occurrence, and to the character of those associated with them.\r\nEspecial care must be taken to distinguish what has been transported\r\nfrom what is _in situ_, otherwise, by attending only to one part of\r\nthe evidence, we shall miss the import of the whole, and altogether\r\nmisinterpret the records which we seek to decipher.\r\n\r\nFor years the subject of the origin of coal formed one of the many\r\nbattle-fields on which geologists delighted to break lances. They\r\nranged themselves under two banners, the \"drift\"-theory men and the\r\n\"growth\"-theory men, the former maintaining strenuously that coal\r\nwas simply vegetation transported from the land and deposited in\r\nlarge troughs at river-mouths or sea-bottoms, the latter as eagerly\r\ncontending that the vegetation had not been drifted, but grew on\r\nthe very locality where its remains are now exhumed. Neither party\r\nlacked plausible arguments in support of its doctrines. The \"drift\"\r\ncombatants stoutly affirmed it to be contrary to all experience that\r\na land-surface should be so oscillating as their opponents required,\r\nthat in short it was absurd to hold each coal-seam as marking a period\r\nof elevation, for there were often dozens of seams in as many yards\r\nof strata, some of them scarcely an inch thick, and yet, according to\r\nthe \"growth\" theory, each would have required for its accumulation\r\na special uplifting of the land above the sea-level. These and many\r\nother difficulties were thought to be triumphantly overcome by the\r\nhypothesis of transport and deposition. The vegetation borne down\r\nby some ancient Mississippi would collect in vast rafts, and these\r\nbecoming water-logged would sink to the bottom, where, by getting\r\neventually covered over with silt and sand, they would in process of\r\ntime be chemically altered into coal. This explanation was, however,\r\nvigorously resisted by the opposite side. They alleged that the \"drift\"\r\ntheory could account neither for the wide extent of coal-seams nor\r\nfor their remarkable persistency in thickness. If the vegetation had\r\nreally been hurried out to sea by river-action, it seemed natural to\r\nexpect that the coal-seams should occur in sporadic patches of very\r\nunequal thicknesses, according as the drifted plants had been more\r\ndensely or more loosely packed. But this was found not to be the case\r\nin point of fact. The coal-seams were ascertained to be generally\r\nsingularly continuous, and to retain for the most part a pretty uniform\r\nthickness over considerable areas. And what was still more worthy of\r\nnote, they were, as a whole, markedly free from extraneous matter,\r\nsuch as sand and mud. Where these impurities did occur, it was usually\r\nin the form of intercalated seams or partings, often quite as regular\r\nand extensive as the coal itself. Had the vegetation, therefore, been\r\ntransported into the sea, it could hardly fail to get mixed up with\r\nthe fine impalpable mud which, like that of the Ganges or Mississippi,\r\nmight have discoloured the ocean for leagues from the river-mouth,\r\nand settled down as a thickening stratum at the sea-bottom. And many\r\nother arguments, derived from the nature and arrangement of the strata\r\ninterbedded among the coal-seams, were urged to prove that the latter\r\nhad originated from vegetation which grew on the spot.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 33.--Section from Cape Breton coal-field, showing\r\nfour planes of vertical stems, and seven ancient soils with their\r\ncovering of vegetation.\r\n\r\n_a_, sandstones; _b_, shales; _c_, coal; _d_, fire-clays; _e_,\r\narenaceous shales.]\r\n\r\nThe warfare seems now pretty nearly at an end, and as often happens in\r\nsuch cases, it has been found that each party was to some extent in the\r\nright and to some extent in the wrong. It has been ascertained that\r\nsome coal-seams must have originated from the deposition of drift-wood\r\nin the mud and ooze of the sea-bottom, while others undoubtedly arose\r\nfrom the decay and entombment of vegetation in swampy plains of the\r\nland. That the latter mode of formation has been the usual one in most\r\nof our coal-fields has been generally acknowledged since Sir William\r\nLogan's announcement that each coal-seam, for the most part, rests\r\nupon a bed of fire-clay, which, with its embedded roots, marks the\r\nsite of an ancient soil. This fact has been abundantly confirmed in\r\nevery part of this country, and indeed wherever an extended series of\r\ncoal-seams has been examined. Not only have the underlying fire-clays\r\nbeen found, but in not a few instances erect stems of trees, passing\r\ndown through the coal-seam and spreading out their divergent roots in\r\nthe clay below, exactly as they must have done when they flourished\r\ngreen and luxuriant in the times of the Carboniferous system. This was\r\nespecially the case in the Parkfield Colliery, Wolverhampton, where\r\nseventy-three trunks were laid bare in the space of about a quarter of\r\nan acre, each with its roots attached. The same appearance was observed\r\nsome years ago in the Dalkeith coal-field, where a group of erect\r\ntrees was encountered covering a space of several square yards. Some\r\ninstructive sections of such fossil-forests are given by Mr. Brown from\r\nthe Cape Breton coal-field.[63] In one of them (Fig. 33) no fewer than\r\nfour planes occur, each supporting its group of erect steins. Now, no\r\none can glance over this and the other sections illustrative of the\r\nsame paper, or the descriptions given by Sir Charles Lyell and others\r\nof the Nova Scotian coal-field, without being compelled to admit that\r\nthe trees in question grew just where their upright stems can still be\r\nseen, and consequently that the accompanying coal-seams originated not\r\nfrom vegetation drifted by river-action, but from vegetation that grew\r\nupon the spot. And though erect stems do not exist in every coal-field,\r\nwe seldom fail to detect the not less important occurrence of the\r\nfire-clays and hardened shales that support the coal-seams and prove\r\nby their embedded rootlets their identity with ancient soils. Thus we\r\narrive at the inference that while in certain localities coal-seams\r\nhave resulted from drifted vegetable matter, they have nevertheless for\r\nthe most part been formed from plants that flourished where the collier\r\nnow excavates, amid damp and dripping caverns, their carbonized remains.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 63: _Quart. Jour. Geol. Soc._ vol. vi. pp. 120, 130. The cut\r\ngiven above (Fig. 33) is taken from one of these sections as modified\r\nby the late Sir Henry de la Beche (_Geological Observer_, p. 582). In\r\nthe original the beds are inclined at a considerable angle, but for the\r\nsake of clearness they are here reduced to horizontality.]\r\n\r\nApplying, then, this deduction to the strata occurring on the horizon\r\nof the mountain limestone in Mid-Lothian, we are led to believe that\r\nthe North Greens coal-seam marks the site of a former land-surface.\r\nIt shows no vertical stems, but has all the other accompaniments of\r\nan ordinary seam, such as the underlying fire-clay and shale, with\r\ntheir included stigmariæ. And this conclusion has more than ordinary\r\ninterest, for if it be true, we have evidence of a terrestrial\r\nformation among strata unequivocally marine; in other words, we see\r\nproofs either of an elevation or a filling-up[64] of the sea-bottom\r\ncarried slowly on until land-plants grew up in matted swamps where\r\nonce there swarmed corals and encrinites, and then of a gradual\r\nsubsidence, so that marine organisms flourished again in abundance\r\nover the site of the submerged vegetation. It is not insisted that\r\neach of the thin coal-seams among the limestone strata marks a former\r\nterrestrial area. Some of them may possibly have resulted from the\r\ntransport and deposition of plants borne from the land. Yet there are\r\nothers of wide extent resting upon beds of fire-clay which contains\r\nstigmaria rootlets, &c. These I cannot but regard as the remains of\r\nplants that grew upon the spot. And so, while we recognise in the beds\r\nof limestone undoubted evidence of a former sea-bottom, I am persuaded\r\nwe must equally admit that at least several of the coal-seams bear fair\r\nevidence of a former land-surface, scarcely raised above the sea-level\r\nindeed, but nourishing nevertheless a thickly matted vegetation. In\r\nthis way we shall see the mountain limestone series of the Lothians\r\nto be not a purely marine formation, but one partly marine and partly\r\ndeltoid, showing in the succession of its strata proofs of a gradual\r\nsubmergence, interrupted by movements of elevation, so that the area\r\nwhich at one period formed the ocean-bed became at a later time low\r\ndelta-land, and after continuing perhaps for ages to stretch out its\r\nverdant surface beneath the open sky, sank again amid the corals of a\r\nwide-spread sea.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 64: If it be correct to set down the North Greens coal-seam\r\nas really representing a terrestrial surface, that is, of course, a\r\nflat delta or plain scarcely raised above the sea-level, we must, I\r\nsuspect, call in the aid of a slight elevatory process, or else hold\r\nthat the depth of the sea at the locality where the lower limestone was\r\nforming did not exceed 80 or 90 feet, and may have been considerably\r\nless, and that this space came to be eventually filled up by the\r\ndetritus of the river. But the wide extent and sometimes the great\r\nthickness of the limestone beds seem to indicate a greater depth, and\r\nthus favour the idea of an elevation of the sea-bottom to form the\r\nNorth Greens coal-seam.]\r\n\r\nNow this condition of things differs entirely from what is presented\r\nby the Mountain Limestone group of England. That formation, when\r\ntypically developed, attains a thickness of from 1000 to 2000 feet, and\r\ngives rise to that green hilly kind of scenery whence it has derived\r\nits name. It is unequivocally a marine deposit, since it abounds in\r\ncorals, echinoderms, brachiopodous molluscs, and other productions of\r\nthe deep. Northward, however, it undergoes a gradual change, getting\r\ngreatly thinner, and split up by a series of intercalations of shale\r\nand sandstone. This alteration goes on until, on the border-land\r\nbetween the two countries, the massive limestone of Derbyshire has\r\ndwindled down into a series of thin beds, often widely separated by\r\nintervening strata, which contain many seams of coal. After crossing\r\nthe Silurian district, and descending the northern slopes of the\r\nLammermuir Hills, we get into the Carboniferous system again, and find\r\nits limestone series still farther diminished. With this decrease\r\nof marine formations, we can detect an augmentation of coal-bearing\r\nstrata. Thus the Berwickshire coal-field lies in this lower set of\r\nbeds, far under the coal-measures of Newcastle. In the Lothians, too,\r\nas has been shown, coal is extensively worked in the same series, and\r\nthese seams also find their representatives in Fife and Lanarkshire.\r\nThe gradual change from the kind of strata found on the horizon of\r\nthe Burdiehouse limestone, to those occurring on the horizon of the\r\nMountain limestone, indicates, as we saw, a gradual change of the\r\nconditions of deposition; and the nature of this alteration is shown by\r\nthe difference in the character of the imbedded fossils. The passage\r\nof the massive Derbyshire limestone into the thin limestones and\r\ncoal-bearing sandstones of the north, as decidedly marks another change\r\nin the relative position of sea and land. The former was a succession\r\nin time, the latter was one in space, but the mode of reasoning remains\r\nthe same for both. In the former case, we saw estuarine strata passing\r\nupward into others wholly marine, and the order of superposition told\r\nus that the locality was first an estuary, and then slowly became open\r\nsea. In the latter case, we see marine beds not succeeded by estuarine\r\nstrata, but becoming estuarine strata themselves. The thick limestones\r\ngradually thin out horizontally into a great series of sandstones and\r\nshales, with interbedded coal-seams, so that what bears evidence of a\r\ndeep sea at the one end, gives proof of a muddy and sandy delta at the\r\nother. In other words, during the ages represented by what we call the\r\nMountain Limestone, the central and south-western portions of England\r\nlay far below a wide breadth of ocean, and nourished a luxuriant crop\r\nof stone-lilies, mingled with the other denizens of the deep, while the\r\nBorder district, and the whole of central Scotland, exhibited all the\r\nconditions of a vast delta, sometimes spreading out as broad verdant\r\njungles, anon showing only scattered irregular groups of low, bare\r\nmud-banks and sand-spits, which at other times disappeared altogether\r\nbeneath the dun discoloured waves. Now the reader will not fail to\r\nmark that this curious and interesting fact in the past history of our\r\ncountry, is ascertained solely from a comparison of fossil remains.\r\nThe stone-lilies and shells of Derbyshire, and the lepidodendra and\r\nland-plants of the Lothians, form our sole basis of evidence, and we\r\nmay rest on them with as perfect certainty as if they were so many duly\r\nattested documents deposited among the archives of our State-Paper\r\nOffice.\r\n\r\nIn our survey of the coal-field of Mid-Lothian, we have passed from\r\nthe Lower Carboniferous estuary beds of Burdiehouse to the Middle\r\nCarboniferous marine beds of Roman Camp Hill, and their associated\r\nterrestrial strata,--the coal-seams and fire-clays. We come now, in our\r\nupward progress, to the Upper Carboniferous group, or Coal-measures\r\nproper.[65] These strata rest immediately upon the limestones, and\r\nattain a depth here of over three thousand feet. They consist of a\r\ngreat series of sandstones, shales, coals, and fire-clays, that vary\r\nin thickness from less than an inch to many feet, or even yards. The\r\ncoal-seams are especially variable, many of them existing as mere films\r\nof carbonaceous matter; others varying up to a depth of fourteen feet.\r\nThere are from fifty to sixty that exceed a foot, but the average\r\nthickness throughout the whole series is about three and a half\r\nfeet.[66] They are nearly all underlaid by fire-clay or shale, and very\r\ngenerally have a roof of the latter material.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 65: These terms--Lower, Middle, and Upper Carboniferous, are\r\nused for want of others, and for the sake of clearness. They must not\r\nbe regarded, however, as equivalent to similar groupings of the English\r\ncarboniferous rocks, for the Scottish series is probably much older\r\nthan the greater part of the English, and coeval, to a considerable\r\nextent, with the mountain limestone and millstone grit of the latter\r\ncountry.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 66: See Milne on Mid-Lothian Coal-field. _Trans. Royal Soc.\r\nEdin._ vol. xiv. p. 256, whence the above details are taken.]\r\n\r\nBy referring to the diagram of this coal-field, given above at p.\r\n196, the reader will notice that the series is divisible into three\r\ngroups:--1_st_, and undermost, a considerable depth of coal bearing\r\nstrata known as the _edge series_, because they lie along the western\r\nlimits of the coal-basin at a high angle, and sometimes even on\r\nedge; 2_d_, A great thickness of sandstones nearly barren of coal,\r\nbut containing at least three beds of limestone this may be termed\r\nthe Roslyn sandstone group; 3_d_, and highest, another series of\r\ncoal-bearing strata, commonly called the _flat coals_, because they\r\noccupy the centre of the basin where the beds repose at a low angle,\r\nand are in places quite flat. It will be convenient to keep in mind\r\nthis three-fold division, for it will point us to some important\r\nchanges in the ancient conditions of this coal-field.\r\n\r\nThe edge series, which forms the lowest, and of course oldest of the\r\nabove groups, averages from 800 to 900 feet in thickness. It contains\r\nabout thirty seams of coal above a foot thick, and many more of less\r\nsize. They occur irregularly, some lying only a few inches apart,\r\nothers from eighty to ninety feet, the intervening space being occupied\r\nby sandstone or shale.\r\n\r\nNow as each coal-seam, with its associated under-clay, appears to mark\r\na former land surface, it will follow that there must be as many old\r\nland surfaces in this series of strata as there are such coal-seams,\r\nand that for every intervening mass of sandstone or shale, the area\r\nof vegetation must have been submerged. This conclusion would have\r\nbeen violently resisted by the supporters of the \"drift\" theory. They\r\nwould have roundly asserted that such an unsteady surface was a mere\r\nsupposition to suit a hypothesis, unsupported by fact, and contrary\r\nto the analogy of existing nature; and they would not perhaps have\r\nhesitated to maintain, that such an oscillating land could be little\r\nfitted to nourish so rich and luxuriant a vegetation as that of the\r\nCarboniferous period. But it will not be difficult to show that our\r\nconclusion, so far from being contrary to analogy, is amply borne\r\nout by the processes of existing nature, and that its opponents, and\r\neven its original asserters, failed to perceive that what it demands\r\nis not a rapidly oscillating crust, but one as steady and uniform as\r\nthat of many of the least disturbed countries at the present day;\r\nand that we do not require to call in the aid of a special elevation\r\nand submergence for every coal-seam, but that for the most part the\r\nhypothesis of a steady sinking of the area of a coal-field, interrupted\r\nperhaps by occasional elevatory movements, along with an active and\r\nconstant deposition of sediment by the varying currents of a large\r\nriver, is sufficient, if not thoroughly to explain, at least to\r\nthrow great light upon the origin of those enormous masses of strata\r\ncomposing our present coal-basins. The oft-recurring variations in\r\nthe nature of the strata that form our coal-measures, sandstones\r\nalternating with shales, these again with coals and fire-clays,\r\ntogether also with the terrestrial origin of the coal-seams, and the\r\noccasional presence of true marine organisms, make it evident that,\r\nto obtain any modern analogue to such a condition of things, we must\r\nexamine those localities where large bodies of fresh water, carrying\r\nsediment and vegetation from the land, mingle with the sea. Let us then\r\nlook for a little at the operations now in progress at the mouths of\r\nthe larger rivers, and mark how far they elucidate the structure and\r\nhistory of a coal-field.\r\n\r\n\"Egypt is the gift of the Nile.\" Such was the conclusion arrived at by\r\none of the most diligent observers of ancient Greece--the venerable\r\nHerodotus.[67] He sailed up the river marking all the leading features\r\nin its scenery, and noting the more apparent evidences of ancient\r\nphysical changes. His remarks on these subjects form one of the\r\nearliest specimens of scientific reasoning that have come down to us,\r\nand are remarkable for their correctness and the truly inductive mode\r\nof thought which they evince. Modern travellers have amply confirmed\r\nthe opinions of the father of history, and we now know that but for its\r\ncentral river, Egypt would be a vast dreary expanse of arid sand like\r\nthe neighbouring deserts of Lybia. The Nile, by annually inundating\r\nthe country, deposits over it a stratum of rich loam, and thus not\r\nonly waters the land, but continually renews the soil. The sediment\r\nin this way brought down has gradually encroached upon the waters of\r\nthe Mediterranean, being heaped up at the river mouth into shifting\r\nsand-banks, islets, and great tracts of low, swampy ground, slightly\r\nraised above the sea-level. Through this series of silting deposits,\r\nthe river sends a number of branches, often winding in labyrinthine\r\nconvolutions, and ever changing their course, by wearing away the silt\r\nat one place, and throwing it down at another. The area traversed by\r\nthe mouths of the Nile was called by the Greeks the Delta, from its\r\nsimilarity in form to the Greek letter, and the name has since been\r\ngiven to all such fluviatile deposits, whether they have this general\r\nform or not.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 67: _Euterpe_, 5.--His words are very emphatic. \"To one of\r\nordinary intelligence, who has not heard of it before, but sees it,\r\nEgypt is manifestly land acquired by the inhabitants, and a gift from\r\nthe river--δωρον τον ποταμον.\" The 10th and 12th chapters of the same\r\nbook deserve especial study for the admirable inductive style in which\r\nthe historian compares the phenomena observable in Egypt with what were\r\nwell known as the results of river action in other lands. The passages\r\nmight be quoted word for word in the most rigid scientific argument of\r\nany modern geologist.]\r\n\r\nThe sediment annually deposited by the Nile varies in thickness in\r\ndifferent years. The mean thickness of the annual layers at Cairo has\r\nbeen calculated not to exceed that of a sheet of thin pasteboard, so\r\nthat \"a stratum of two or three feet must represent the accumulation\r\nof a thousand years.\"[68] Such thin laminæ must resemble greatly some\r\nof the more fissile shales in the Carboniferous system, which were,\r\nperhaps, formed by as slow a process, and in their aggregate depth\r\nprobably took many thousand years to accumulate. But those fluviatile\r\ndepositions of the Nile vary little in kind, for when cut through they\r\nare found regularly stratified down to their base, which rests upon the\r\ngreat underlying sand. They show us how the argillaceous seams of the\r\ncoal-measures may have originated; but the diversity of character in\r\nthese Carboniferous rocks indicates a more varied kind of sediment, and\r\nprobably more rapid and active transporting currents. A closer analogy\r\nto such a condition of things meets us on the shores of the New World.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 68: Lyell's _Principles_, p. 262.]\r\n\r\nThe Mississippi, so magnificent in all its proportions, has raised\r\na delta which covers a tract of about 14,000 square miles, equal to\r\nalmost half the area of Ireland. The lower parts of this delta are\r\nformed of low, shifting banks, traversed by innumerable streams that\r\ndiverge from the main river, and alternately throw down and remove vast\r\nquantities of earthy sediment, intermingled with rafts of drift-wood.\r\nThese swamps are covered with a rank growth of long grass and reeds,\r\nand for about six months of the year are more or less submerged below\r\nthe waters of the river, while liable at the same time to continual\r\ninundation and encroachment from the sea. The higher parts of the\r\ndelta, though also subject to a similar periodical submergence,\r\nnourish a more luxuriant vegetation. Vast tracts of level sandy soil\r\nare densely overgrown with pine, which is used extensively for making\r\npitch. Large districts of the swampy ground are covered with willows,\r\npoplars, and thickets of the deciduous cypress, an elegant tree that\r\nrises more than 100 feet above the soil. When in hot seasons these\r\nswamps get dried up, \"pits are burnt into the ground many feet deep,\r\nor as far down as the fire can descend without meeting with water,\r\nand it is then found that scarcely any residuum or earthy matter is\r\nleft. At the bottom of all these 'cypress swamps' a bed of clay is\r\nfound, with roots of the tall cypress, just as the underclays of the\r\ncoal are filled with stigmaria.\"[69] In this way a thick accumulation\r\nof vegetable matter goes on forming for years, until either the river\r\nchanges its course, and inundating the swamp gradually covers it over\r\nwith sand and mud, or until, owing to oscillations of the earth's\r\ncrust, the district is either permanently submerged, so as to be silted\r\nover, or elevated to nourish a new and different kind of vegetation.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 69: Lyell's _Elements_, p. 386.]\r\n\r\nThat such changes have taken place in the past history of the river we\r\nhave several interesting proofs. Thus, owing to the great earthquakes\r\nof 1811, 1812, an area of more than 2000 square miles was permanently\r\nsubmerged.[70] Since then it has gone under the name of the \"Sunk\r\nCountry;\" and Sir Charles Lyell, who visited the locality in 1846, that\r\nis, thirty-four years afterwards, tells us that he saw innumerable\r\nsubmerged trees, some erect, others prostrate. Now, it is easy to see\r\nhow such an area may, when the climate suits, become the receptacle of\r\nvast accumulations of peat, which, by pressure and chemical action,\r\nwill ultimately pass into coal. If we suppose the submergence carried\r\non more rapidly at some periods, the plants might have been unable to\r\nkeep pace with the ever-increasing inroads of sand and mud. In such\r\ncases the layer of vegetation would become eventually entombed beneath\r\nsucceeding deposits of earthy matter. Were the amount of sediment thus\r\nthrown down sufficient in the end to counteract the downward motion of\r\nthe earth's crust, and so raise the bottom of the river or lake to the\r\nlevel of the water, vegetation would spring up afresh and clothe the\r\nnew raised surface as densely as in former years. This alternation,\r\naccording as the amount of sinking or the amount of sediment\r\npredominated, might go on for thousands of years, until a series of\r\nstrata many thousand feet thick were accumulated, and tranquilly\r\ncarried down bed after bed below the level of the waters.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 70: See Sir Charles Lyell's _Second Visit to United Stales_,\r\nchap, xxxiii.]\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to know that the case supposed here has actually\r\nbeen realized in the delta of the Ganges. Some years ago an Artesian\r\nwell was attempted to be made near Calcutta, and the auger was sunk\r\nto a depth of 481 feet.[71] The material passed through consisted of\r\nsand, clay, and nodules of argillaceous limestone, and at various\r\ndepths, from 50 to 380 feet, several seams of decaying wood and peat\r\nwere found, along with bones of various animals, such as deer and\r\nfresh-water tortoises, and fragments of lacustrine shells. Each of\r\nthese vegetable layers evidently formed at one time a forest-covered\r\nswamp like those of the surrounding delta at the present day; and\r\nhence it follows, that during the accumulation of the Gangetic delta,\r\nthe ground in that locality must have undergone a depression of more\r\nthan 300 feet, and that this sinking has been interrupted by slight\r\nelevations, or by periods when the ground remained stationary, so as\r\nto admit of a dense and prolonged growth of vegetation, at successive\r\nintervals, upon the swampy flats and shifting islands. The general\r\nappearance of these old forests is pretty well shown by the mangrove\r\nswamps along the mouths of the river. These trees flourish in dense\r\njungles on the banks, and extend even below high water mark, being\r\ncovered in places by shell fish. So that were these maritime parts\r\nof the delta inundated by the ocean, and buried beneath a mass of mud\r\nand silt, the peaty layer that would be formed would display trunks of\r\ntrees still occupying their original erect position, and spreading out\r\ntheir roots in the clay below, exactly as the sigillaria is found to do\r\nin the coal-seams of the carboniferous rocks, while clustered round the\r\ncarbonized stems, or scattered among the decayed leaves and branches,\r\nthere might be detected limpets and barnacles (as lingulæ and pectens\r\noccur in the coal-seams), showing, by their mode of occurrence, that\r\nthey lived and died upon the spot.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 71: See Lyell's _Principles_, p. 280.]\r\n\r\nIf my reader will now suppose this sand of the Indian river to be\r\nhardened into sandstone, the mud in like manner compressed into\r\nshale, and the peat beds chemically altered into coal, can he fail to\r\nperceive the striking analogy between the section thus displayed and\r\nthose already given from the Mid-Lothian and Cape Breton coal-fields?\r\nThe differences between the ancient and modern strata are not in kind\r\nbut in degree. The Scottish series reaches to more than six times the\r\nthickness of the Indian one, and the coal-seams in the one exceed in\r\nindividual thickness the peat-beds in the other. We must remember,\r\nhowever, that the climate of Hindustan is not remarkably favourable to\r\nthe accumulation of vegetable matter, the heat being so great that the\r\nplants decay almost as rapidly as they grow. And it should likewise\r\nbe borne in mind, that were the conditions of subsidence and of the\r\ngradual accumulation of sedimentary matter to continue even in the same\r\nratio as heretofore, the Ganges might, in the course of ages, heap up\r\na series of stratified sands, clays, and peat-beds, many thousand feet\r\nin thickness, and many thousand square miles in extent, rivalling,\r\nor perhaps surpassing in depth, the largest coal-field in the world.\r\nThe parallelism between this delta and an ordinary coal-field holds\r\nsingularly close, not merely as regards the nature of the stratified\r\ndeposits. The alluvial plain of Bengal has undergone a process of\r\nsubsidence to an unknown depth, whereby successive areas of terrestrial\r\nvegetation have been carried down to be entombed beneath fluviatile\r\nsand and mud. It is likewise subject to the more sudden operation\r\nof earthquakes, whereby large tracts of country become permanently\r\naltered, and changes are effected on the direction, rapidity, and\r\ndetritus of the streams. It is, moreover, liable to wide-spread\r\ninroads of the sea, which sometimes covers cultivated districts to\r\na depth of several feet, laying waste the fields and destroying the\r\ninhabitants. These and other features help us to understand the origin\r\nof such vast masses of sedimentary strata as those of our coal-fields,\r\nwhere terrestrial, fluviatile, and marine remains alternate in rapid\r\nsequence, or sometimes occur together.\r\n\r\nThe origin of the constant succession of coal seams, sandstones, and\r\nshales, of the Edge series may be thus accounted for. The area of\r\nMid-Lothian formed part of a great delta, which, like that of the\r\nGanges, was undergoing a gradual subsidence during the Carboniferous\r\nera. The rate of this movement probably varied at different times, and\r\nmight even be occasionally interrupted by short periods of elevation.\r\nWhen the ever-increasing accumulations of silt brought down by the\r\nriver reached or nearly reached the surface of the water, they would\r\nbecome the site of wide tracts of swampy vegetation that flourished\r\nfor hundreds or thousands of years. Eventually, however, these\r\njungles, invaded by the changing currents of the river, were buried\r\nbeneath a thick deposit of fluviatile sediment, or more probably the\r\nvegetation might become unable to keep pace with an accelerated rate\r\nof submergence, and the forests would then be tranquilly carried\r\ndown beneath the water, and soon covered over with sand and mud. The\r\ndetrital matter might in like manner continue to be deposited over the\r\nsunk forest for many years, perhaps centuries, until the muddy bottom\r\nagain reached the surface, and once more waved green with sigillariæ,\r\ncalamites, and lepidodendra. Another long interval might here elapse,\r\nin which a thick bed of vegetable matter might accumulate, much after\r\nthe manner of the formation of peat among the bogs and mosses of our\r\nown country. The periodical inundations of the river probably gave\r\nrise to wide marshes and lagoons, often tenanted by lacustrine shells,\r\nand thickly overgrown with aquatic vegetation. The decaying plants\r\ndecomposed the red ochreous matter with which the water was charged,\r\nand re-deposited it among the mud and rotting leaves at the bottom as\r\na carbonate of iron. Such ferruginous accumulations, often entombing\r\nfern-stems and other plants, with scales and teeth of ganoidal fishes,\r\nsometimes _conulariæ_ and _lingulæ_, and, in certain localities, whole\r\nacres and miles of fresh-water shells, are known now as our _clay-band_\r\nand _black-band ironstones_. We can easily conceive that, in shallower\r\nparts of the lagoons, a dense growth of marshy plants might spring\r\nup, preventing any deposition of iron, and when the whole came to be\r\ncovered over with later accumulations of sand or mud, the deeper parts\r\nof the old lake would be covered with a seam of ironstone, and the\r\nshallower portions would display a bed of coal. In some such way we\r\nmay account for the frequent passage of ironstone into coal, and coal\r\ninto ironstone in many of our coal-fields. If undisturbed by the ever\r\nchanging currents of the river, these wide expanses of marsh and lake\r\nmight continue for many long years, the constant evaporation being\r\ncounterbalanced by continual supplies of water from the main stream.\r\nEventually, however, owing perhaps to another period of more rapid\r\nsubmergence, the water gained the ascendency, and once more rolled over\r\nprostrate stems and matted thickets of ferns, that sank slowly down\r\nbeneath a deepening sheet of sand and mud. Often, too, the sea must\r\nhave flooded, perhaps for years, the flat delta-lands, carrying with it\r\nits own productions, such as the lingulæ and cardiniæ, which we find\r\namong the coal seams. And thus the process went on during the long ages\r\nof the Carboniferous system. Forest after forest spread its continuous\r\nmantle of green athwart the low swampy lands of that old delta, and\r\neach in succession foundered amid the muddy waters, now of the ocean\r\nand now of the river, that strewed over its site a rich detritus which\r\nwent to form the soil of new jungles and forests.\r\n\r\nThe Edge series measures from 800 to 900 feet in depth, so that the\r\ndepression must have been carried on till the forest that once grew\r\nnearly on the sea-level had sunk 800 feet below it This process was\r\nundoubtedly a very slow and tranquil one. Yet geologists used to regard\r\nthese frequent changes of sedimentary matter as so many proofs of\r\nrepeated catastrophic submergences, when the ocean came rolling over\r\nthe land, prostrating forests, uprooting the hugest trees, and leaving\r\nthe scattered bones and scales of fishes amid vast accumulations of mud\r\nand sand, where but lately there had bloomed a luxuriant vegetation.\r\nBut the sober and diligent student of geologic fact will read in these\r\nrocks no such record of cataclysms. He will see in them evidences of\r\nthe same gradual and sure operation which marks the processes of Nature\r\nat the present day. He will note how during a tranquil and probably\r\nimperceptible submergence of the river-bottom, forest after forest\r\nsprang up, flourished perhaps for ages, and eventually settled down\r\nbeneath the waters of the river and sometimes of the ocean, amid ever\r\nincreasing accumulations of mud and sand. Musing on these ancient\r\nchanges he will be lost in wonder at the immense duration of the period\r\nduring which they were in progress; and he will try in some measure\r\nto realize the features of their scenery. He will picture the delta\r\nwith its ever-varying islets and sand-banks, its lakes and submerged\r\nforests, its leafless trunks peering above the water and sticking along\r\nthe shoaling mud, and its crowded jungles that cover every drier spot.\r\nHe will cast his eyes to where the delta opens out into the ocean, and\r\nmark how the waves encroach upon the mud-banks, cutting away what the\r\nriver has piled up, and washing the roots of gigantic trees that wave\r\ntheir green coronal of fronds above, and overshadow the rippling of\r\nthe green sea below. He will try to thread the windings of the stately\r\nriver through brakes of ferns and calamites, and banks richly hung\r\nwith tree-ferns and sigillariæ, and then upward through dark shaggy\r\npine-woods, silent and gloomy, with the water creeping lazily through\r\nthe shade or dashing in white cascades over dripping rocks, and onward\r\nstill, far away among the distant hills till the fountainhead of the\r\ngreat stream is reached, gushing from the splintered sides of some\r\nlone rock, or pouring perchance out of the glimmering caverns of some\r\nmassive glacier high amid the regions of perpetual snow.\r\n\r\nMany attempts have been made to estimate the amount of time which\r\nsome of our coal-fields may have required for their accumulation.\r\nBut so large a number of conjectural elements must necessarily enter\r\ninto such calculations, that the results come to be of very doubtful\r\nvalue. By estimating the amount of sediment annually transported by\r\nsuch rivers as the Ganges or Mississippi, we may ascertain how long a\r\nmass of similar sedimentary strata would take to form under similar\r\nconditions. And if our calculation had to do merely with such detrital\r\naccumulations, we might hope to arrive at some approach to accuracy.\r\nBut besides these sedimentary strata, the formation of which must have\r\nbeen wholly analogous to that of similar deposits at the present day,\r\nwe have to deal with the problems suggested by the coal-seams. We know\r\nnothing of the climate of the Carboniferous period save what may be\r\nconjectured from the analogy of existing climates; and in a question\r\nregarding the accumulation of decaying vegetable matter climate is a\r\nsubject of the first importance. We are ignorant, too, of the rate of\r\ngrowth peculiar to the carboniferous flora; and even if we hold that\r\nit was probably rapid, the process of decay may have been equally\r\nspeedy, and so a forest might go on shooting up fresh trees as the old\r\nones rotted away, yet at the end of a thousand years there might be a\r\nscarcely greater thickness of vegetable matter on the ground than at\r\nthe commencement. A seam of coal two feet thick might thus represent,\r\nsay the accumulation of a hundred years, and another of exactly the\r\nsame thickness might stand as the accumulation of a thousand years.\r\nUntil we know more of the vegetation and climate of the coal period,\r\nthe thickness of a coal-seam can hardly be held as a certain guide to\r\nthe lapse of time required for its formation.\r\n\r\nFor the sake of illustration, let me take the following fragment of a\r\ncoal-measure section:--\r\n\r\n  Shale,      20 feet.\r\n  Coal,        4   \"\r\n  Fire-clay,   6   \"\r\n  Sandstone,  40   \"\r\n\r\nBeginning at the bottom, we may compute the period of the forty feet\r\nof sandstone variously, according to the river selected as the type\r\nof a transporting agent. Tried by the standard of the Nile, all other\r\nconditions being similar, such a deposit would require perhaps not\r\nless than 14,000 years; by that of the Mississippi, 5000; and by that\r\nof the Ganges, nearly 2000.[72] We come, then, to the superincumbent\r\nfire-clay and coal, representing an ancient soil and the forest that\r\ngrew on it. The occurrence of these seams shows us that the river-bed\r\nhad become a swampy tract clothed with vegetation; but who shall\r\nsay how long it may have continued so? Like the sunk country of the\r\nMississippi, it may have been submerged, and to some extent cut off\r\nfrom the sediment-transporting channels of the river, and thus, as\r\na vast lake, have nourished a prolific growth of marshy and aquatic\r\nplants. If the temperature resembled that of our own country, the\r\ngrowth of peaty matter, other circumstances being favourable, might\r\nbe comparatively rapid. If, however, as seems probable, the climate\r\nwere more warm and humid, giving rise to a more luxuriant vegetation,\r\nand at the same time to a more rapid decay, a long interval might have\r\nelapsed without adding materially to the thickness of the vegetable\r\naccumulations, and the eventual entombment of peaty matter sufficient\r\nto consolidate into four feet of coal, might be owing in some measure\r\nto the submergence of the swamp beneath the waters of the river,\r\nwhereby a quantity of detrital matter was deposited that arrested the\r\nprocess of putrefaction, and entombed the thickly matted plants which\r\nwere growing on the spot at the time. Hence, until we know more of\r\nthe conditions under which vegetation may accumulate at river-mouths\r\nin such a climate as the coal plants are conjectured to have enjoyed,\r\ncalculations of the amount of time required for the formation of a\r\ngreat series of coal-bearing strata must be regarded as premature.\r\nIn the present instance, we can but affirm that the growth of the\r\nfour-foot coal-seam probably occupied many long years, even at the most\r\nrapid rate of accumulation known to us. The forest-covered swamp on\r\nwhich the plants grew was eventually invaded by muddy detritus brought\r\ndown by the river; and during another period of indefinite extent--five\r\nhundred years or five thousand years--fine mud continued to settle down\r\nover the foundered forest, hardening eventually into twenty feet of\r\nshale.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 72: Some observers have pointed to the occurrence of vertical\r\nand inclined trunks of trees in the Carboniferous sandstones, and\r\ndeduced therefrom what has seemed to them a triumphant argument in\r\nfavour of the rapidity wherewith our coal-fields must have formed. A\r\nfoundered tree, they say, sank with its heavy-laden roots among the\r\nsand at the bottom, its stem pointing up into the water like the snags\r\nof the Mississippi, so that the sand must have come rapidly down to\r\nentomb the whole before it had time to decay, and thus thirty or forty\r\nfeet of sediment must have been deposited in a few years, perhaps even\r\nmonths. But this is somewhat like a begging of the question. We have\r\nyet to learn how long a water-logged trunk will resist decomposition.]\r\n\r\nThe Edge coals of the Mid-Lothian coal-field are succeeded by a group\r\nof sandstones and thin shales, with three or more seams of limestone.\r\nThis group of strata, which we may call the Roslyn Sandstone Series,\r\nreaches a thickness of from 1200 to 1500 feet, and serves as a middle\r\nzone to divide the Edge coals below from the Flat coals above. It\r\ncontains only a few thin laminations of coal, and these chiefly at its\r\nupper and under portions. Such a great intercalation of beds, without\r\ncoal-seams, points, we might readily conjecture, to some change in the\r\nphysical conditions of the ancient delta. The nature of this change can\r\nbe easily made out from an examination of the rocks, and the reader\r\nwill see that here again we are indebted to fossil remains for the most\r\nconclusive and satisfactory evidence of these old physical revolutions.\r\n\r\nThe absence of coal-seams suffices to indicate that during the\r\nformation of the middle group that part of the delta occupying the\r\nsite of Mid-Lothian was continually submerged, and never rose to the\r\nsurface so as to allow a covering of vegetation to form upon it.[73]\r\nThe large beds of sandstone prove a continued transport and deposition\r\nof detritus during undisturbed periods of considerable length. The\r\nintercalations of shale, pointing to local changes in the currents or\r\nother modifying causes, are usually of small thickness and extent,\r\nwhile the sandstone beds sometimes attain a depth of 150 or 200 feet,\r\nand extend over wide areas of country. So far these mechanical rocks\r\nindicate the deposition of sand and mud under water, but whether at\r\nriver-mouth or sea-bottom is left uncertain. From the fossil remains,\r\nhowever, we learn that the deposition took place in the sea, but at\r\nno great distance from land; in other words, the area of Mid-Lothian,\r\nwhich, during the accumulation of the edge coals, had been alternately\r\nclothed with vegetation and inundated by the river, sank down many\r\nfathoms, so that the sea rolled over it and all its submerged forests.\r\nThe proof is two-fold, first, from the character of the organic remains\r\nin the limestones; and second, from that of those in the sandstones and\r\nshales.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 73: Of course, this deduction is founded, as the reader\r\nwill notice, on the assumption that we have now the series, as it was\r\ndeposited, and that no peaty swamp or forest was denuded away, and its\r\nsite occupied by sand and silt. But the assumption is rendered probable\r\nfrom the conditions of formation indicated by the Roslyn group.]\r\n\r\nIn some of the streamlets that flow into the beautifully wooded vale\r\nof the Esk, south of Penicuik, these limestones can be well seen,\r\nworn in the water-channel, or crusted over with moss along the banks.\r\nTheir organisms are singularly abundant, and consist of cyathophylla,\r\nencrinites, spirifers, producti, &c., all exclusively marine. In a\r\npicturesque brook that falls into the Esk near a saw-mill in the\r\ngrounds of Penicuik House, I have seen the little cup-corals clustered\r\nby dozens on the weathered rock, showing their delicate striated\r\nwrinkles in high relief among the scattered valves of productus and\r\ninnumerable joints of the stone-lily. They were all well preserved, and\r\nin their grouping and general appearance differed in no respect from\r\nsimilar organisms in the mountain limestone of Roman Camp Hill. The\r\ninference to be drawn from them must accordingly correspond with what\r\nhas been deduced from the mountain limestone fossils, viz., that they\r\nmark the site of a sea-bottom which remained free from mud and sand for\r\nconsiderable periods, during each of which there abounded corals and\r\nshells, whose exuviæ went to form several seams of limestone. But that\r\nthis sea-bottom was at no period very far distant from land, is proved\r\nby the drifted plants that occur in the sandstones and shales both\r\nbelow and above, and which often show so little trace of maceration,\r\nthat we can hardly believe they were carried far, or floated for a long\r\nwhile previous to being enveloped in the sand or mud at the bottom. I\r\nhave never detected vegetable remains in the limestones themselves, but\r\nthere seems no reason why they should not be found there.\r\n\r\nOne of the most remarkable and difficult phenomena presented by these\r\nlimestones is their great persistency. I have traced them over a\r\nlarge part of Mid-Lothian, from the highly inclined beds at Joppa to\r\nthe contorted and faulted strata near Carlops. I have found them,\r\ntoo, in many parts of West-Lothian and Stirlingshire, from the sea at\r\nBorrowstounness southwards into Lanarkshire. They likewise occur in\r\nFife, and seem to sweep away through Lanark and Ayrshire. The area\r\nin which I have found them cannot be much under 700 square miles,\r\nyet they are probably spread over a much greater extent of country.\r\nThroughout this region they appear to continue on the whole at pretty\r\nmuch the same vertical distance from each other, and average three or\r\nfour feet thick each. They vary in number, three being found in parts\r\nof Mid-Lothian, in other parts only two. Throughout West-Lothian there\r\nseem to be but two seams in the middle or moor-rock series, and the\r\nsame two seams are found passing over into Perth near Culross. There\r\nare differences, too, in the structure and composition of the seams,\r\none running sometimes as a single bed of dull blue limestone, and\r\nthen gradually splitting up into three layers of a greyer and more\r\nearthy texture, with soft shale between them. But making all these\r\nabatements, the observer cannot fail to be struck with the general\r\nregularity and continuity of these limestones. And the fact becomes\r\nall the more remarkable when we consider the great irregularity, and\r\ncontinual intercalations, and repetitions of the strata, both above and\r\nbelow. Marine beds are usually persistent over large areas, especially\r\nwhere extensively developed. As they decrease in thickness, their\r\ncontinuity for the most part lessens, so that the rule is, on the\r\nwhole, a safe one, the thinner any particular stratum, the less likely\r\nare we to trace it to a considerable distance. Yet, not only are these\r\nMid-Lothian limestones thin, but they occur in regular sequence among\r\na set of continually alternating and very irregular beds, and extend\r\nover several hundred square miles of country. And this, too, not in a\r\nsingle seam, but in two, three, or even more, so that the difficulty of\r\naccounting for such intercalations is proportionately increased.\r\n\r\nWe have seen above that the area of a delta is often partially\r\nsubmerged below the sea, and that such changes may become of the most\r\nmarked kind where the country is liable to be depressed by earthquakes.\r\nThere can accordingly be no difficulty in understanding how the ancient\r\ncarboniferous delta of Mid-Lothian may have likewise subsided. But the\r\nlimestones are unmistakable evidence that not only was the area of\r\nthe delta submerged, but that for a while no sediment was deposited\r\nover it, and hence marine animals peculiar to clear water flourished\r\nso long and so abundantly as to form by their remains several beds of\r\nlimestone. Had these beds been merely local we might have regarded them\r\nas having been deposited in lagoon-like portions of the delta, shut out\r\nfrom the detrital matter of the river on the one side and open to the\r\nsea on the other. But their wide extent and nearly uniform thickness\r\npreclude such a supposition. The following explanation appears to me\r\nthe most probable:--\r\n\r\nAfter the series of the Edge coals had been brought to a close, the\r\ncoal-fields of Scotland underwent a complete submergence below the sea.\r\nThis depression was probably very gradual, yet more rapid than that\r\nlong-continued one which had been going on during the earlier part of\r\nthe Carboniferous series, and the consequence of this greater rapidity\r\nwas to prevent the growth of stigmaria swamps or reedy jungles, by\r\nkeeping the alluvial surface continually sunk to some depth below the\r\nwater. The amount of subsidence until the deposition of the lowest\r\nlimestone may not have been great, but even a slight depression would\r\ntell vastly on an area of flat delta land. Mud banks would be brought\r\ndown into the region of waves and surface-currents, and speedily be\r\nspread out over the floor of the sea. Forest-covered islands would in\r\nlike manner be levelled down, and their trees sent drifting seaward\r\nor submerged amid the re-formed silt. Thus altered, the delta would\r\nsink below the sea, and the sediment borne down by the river would\r\nbe scattered out over the older deposits as a slowly-forming sheet.\r\nBy degrees this detrital matter must have been carried less and less\r\nfarther out to sea; in other words, the area of deposit or delta must\r\nhave crept gradually nearer to the land--a result owing partly to the\r\nrecession of the ancient coast-line, and partly perhaps to a greater\r\namount of depression inland than at the coast, which would of course\r\nlessen the velocity of the streams and cause them to deposit their\r\nburden of sediment at higher levels than before. The consequence\r\nof this retreat of the delta from the sea would be to purify the\r\nwater over the site of the old swamps, and render it fitted for the\r\nhabitation of corals, molluscs, and other marine animals. A medium thus\r\nprepared would not be allowed to remain long untenanted, and so we find\r\nthat it came to be densely peopled with the organisms peculiar to such\r\na station. Stone-lilies, cup-corals, net-like bryozoa, molluscs of many\r\nkinds, and large predatory fish, swarmed in these old waters, and their\r\ncalcareous shells and skeletons are now broken up by the quarryman and\r\nthe collier as hard compact limestone.\r\n\r\nAfter these animals had lived and died in successive generations,\r\nperhaps for thousands of years, the downward movement of the earth's\r\ncrust seems to have ceased for a while or to have become greatly less.\r\nThe effect of this would be just to reverse what had been previously\r\ndone, especially if a slight elevatory movement took place. The streams\r\nwould in such circumstances descend from the uplifted ground with\r\nrenewed velocity and transport their detritus to gradually increasing\r\ndistances. The muddy and sandy sediment thus borne seawards would\r\nslowly silt over the coral-banks at the bottom, and in conditions so\r\nungenial the organisms would dwindle down and finally die out. A great\r\nthickness of sand and mud would be spread out over their remains so\r\nlong as the currents from the land continued to carry sediment out to\r\nsea, and thus probably originated the sandstones and shales superposed\r\nabove the lowest limestone.\r\n\r\nEventually the old steady downward movement returned, and with it the\r\ncorals and stone-lilies. The detritus again sank to the bottom much\r\nnearer the land, forming great banks and shoals that choked up the\r\nriver-mouth. Seaward the water regained its purity, and the bottom\r\nonce more swarmed with living things. Another lapse of many thousand\r\nyears may have here intervened during which the marine exuviæ gathered\r\ninto another seam of limestone, until again the process of subsidence\r\neither ceased for a time, or what is perhaps more probable, became\r\nconsiderably feebler. Detrital matter began to creep seaward as\r\nbefore, and eventually entombed the corallines and crinoids to a great\r\ndepth. The calcareous bed thus formed is the second limestone, and the\r\nsuperincumbent silt-beds represent the sandstones and shales that rest\r\nabove it.\r\n\r\nIn some such way as this does the Roslyn sandstone series appear to\r\nhave originated. I have indicated what seems to have been the main\r\nfeatures in the process, but it was probably a very complex one. There\r\nmay have been a great many oscillations of level of variable effects,\r\nsome of them raising the disturbed area to a much greater height at\r\none point than at another. This inequality would of course produce\r\nmarked effects along a low flat country such as that at the mouth of a\r\ngreat river. New currents would be produced and the direction of old\r\nones changed; great shoals and banks of silt would be worn down only\r\nto be thrown up again at some new point, where another oscillatory\r\nmovement would expose them afresh to destructive denudation. The\r\nvariations in the amount of elevation and depression would likewise\r\nmodify the transport of detritus to the sea, and give rise to a varied\r\nand ever-changing sea-bottom. In short, the alternations and variations\r\nmust have been endless, for to the ordinary multiplied interchanges of\r\na delta we must add those induced by a constant and unequal oscillation\r\nof the earth's crust.\r\n\r\nThe Roslyn sandstone series comes to a close, and passing onward in\r\nascending scale we meet with another great group of coal-bearing\r\nstrata. They occupy the central area of the Mid-Lothian coal-field,\r\nand from their gentle inclination as compared with the lower strata\r\nthat rise up from under them on either side of the basin, are known as\r\nthe _Flat Coals_. Their total thickness--that is to say, all that has\r\nescaped denudation--amounts to a thousand feet or more. They consist\r\nchiefly of sandstones, shales, ironstones, and fire-clays, with from\r\ntwenty to twenty-five seams of coal, of which sixteen are thick enough\r\nto be worked. Their similarity to the Edge coals below points to a\r\nsimilarity in the conditions of formation. The frequent alternations\r\nof sandstone and shale show how the delta gradually pushed outwards\r\nagain and re-occupied its ancient site above the successive forests of\r\nthe Edge series and the successive coral-beds of the Roslyn group. The\r\ncoal-seams indicate the further progress of the detrital accumulations,\r\nand the eventual formation of vast swampy flats that nourished a rank\r\ngrowth of stigmariæ, and tracts of drier ground waving with ferns, and\r\nshadowed by the spiky foliage of the club-moss and the broader fronds\r\nof the tree-fern.\r\n\r\nThe Flat coals are not succeeded by any other palæozoic strata. Above\r\nthem stretches the drift already described: sometimes in the form\r\nof a stiff blue clay resting on a striated rock-surface; sometimes\r\nas a coarse gravel containing fragments of all the rocks in the\r\nneighbourhood; and sometimes as a fine white sand diagonally laminated,\r\nand often showing dark partings of coal-fragments. From the section\r\ngiven above (Fig. 32) at p. 196, the reader, will see that as the\r\nupper limit of the Flat coals is formed by the drift, a large part of\r\nthat series may have been borne away by denuding agencies. Had there\r\nbeen even a seam of limestone above them, it would have sufficed to\r\nshow their true thickness, for we should then have seen, that how\r\nmuch soever had been removed in later times from above the limestone,\r\nnothing had been removed from below it; and so it would mark the true\r\noriginal limit of the series. We cannot now tell how much thicker the\r\nupper part of the Mid-Lothian carboniferous system may have been.\r\nProbably, during the long ages that intervened between palæozoic and\r\npost-tertiary times, many hundred feet were borne away and carried to\r\nother sites, there to grow up into new islands and continents, clothed\r\nwith other types of verdure, and peopled by other races of animals, and\r\nfitted to become, in a long subsequent period, the dwelling-place of\r\nman.\r\n\r\nIn fine, the evidence of these ancient changes in the history of the\r\nMid-Lothian coal-field is derived, as we have seen, from two sets of\r\nfacts; first, those of a mechanical, and, second, those of an organic\r\nkind--the one class explaining and confirming the other. Beginning our\r\ninvestigation at the horizon of the Burdiehouse limestone, we saw the\r\ncurtain rise slowly from off a wide estuary, in which there gambolled\r\nlarge bone-covered fishes, while huge pine-trees--branchless and bare,\r\nseed-cones, fern-fronds, and twigs of club-moss, floated slowly away\r\nout to sea. The panorama moved on, and brought before us the ocean-bed\r\nof the Roman Camp limestone, with its groves of stone-lilies and\r\nbunches of coral; its tiny shells moored to the bottom, or creeping\r\nslowly athwart the limy floor, or spreading out their many arms, and\r\nrising or sinking at will. This picture passed slowly away, and then\r\ncame the delta of the Edge coals, with its sand-banks and ever-shifting\r\ncurrents, its stigmaria swamps, and its forest-covered islets. We saw\r\nthe delta gradually sink beneath the sea, and corals and stone-lilies\r\ncluster thick over its submerged area, to form the limestones of the\r\nRoslyn group. Again, the mud-bars of the river crept out to sea, and\r\ntangled forests waved green as of old, washed by the sea or inundated\r\nby the river. How this last period came to a close, we shall probably\r\nnever know, and have no possible means of conjecturing. We pass at one\r\nstep from the ancient era of the coal to the comparatively modern one\r\nof the drift--from a verdant palæozoic land, to an icy post-tertiary\r\nsea. It is like a leap in history from the days of Pericles and Aspasia\r\nto those of King Otho, or from the tents of Runnymede to the Crystal\r\nPalace of Sydenham.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Trap-pebbles of the boulder--Thickness of the earth's crust\r\n       unknown--Not of much consequence to the practical\r\n       geologist--Interior of the earth in a highly heated\r\n       condition--Proofs of this--Granite and hypogene\r\n       rocks--Trap-rocks; their identity with lavas and\r\n       ashes--Scenery of a trappean country--Subdivisions of\r\n       the trap-rocks--Intrusive traps--Trap-dykes-intrusive\r\n       sheets--Salisbury Crags--Traps of the neighbourhood of\r\n       Edinburgh--Amorphous masses--Contemporaneous trap-rocks of\r\n       two kinds--Contemporaneous melted rocks--Tests for their age\r\n       and origin--Examples from neighbourhood of Edinburgh--Tufas\r\n       or volcanic ashes--Their structure and origin--Example\r\n       of contemporaneous trap-rocks--Mode of interpreting\r\n       them--Volcanoes of Carboniferous times--Conclusion.\r\n\r\nIn the previous pages, allusion has been made to the trap-pebbles\r\nimbedded in the boulder, to the various forms of decay exhibited by\r\ngranitic and trappean rocks, and to the elevation and depression of the\r\nsolid crust of the earth. Will the reader bear with me for but a few\r\npages more, while I seek to indicate one or two points of interest in\r\na branch of geology that would abundantly reward a diligent observer?\r\nSince the days of Hutton, the investigation of what are called\r\n_igneous_ rocks has fallen somewhat into the background, and geologists\r\nhave given themselves, perhaps too exclusively, to the study of organic\r\nremains, so that while the palæontology of the British islands has\r\nenjoyed an extensive exploration, but little has been done towards the\r\nelucidation of our igneous formations and their accompanying phenomena.\r\nMuch remains to be accomplished, even in those districts usually\r\nregarded as in a manner thread-bare, and he must be but an indifferent\r\nobserver who cannot add a few gleanings to the general stock of\r\ninformation upon this branch of British geology.\r\n\r\nMany conjectures have been formed, and many theories propounded, as\r\nto the nature of the internal parts of our globe. Some have supposed\r\nthat there is an outer solid film or crust, some ten or twenty miles\r\nthick, enveloping a vast ball of intensely heated matter; others have\r\nattempted to show that the interior must be nearly solid throughout,\r\nwith, however, great lakes, or vesicles of gas and melted rock,\r\nsomewhat after the fashion, we may suppose, of the oil-holes in a\r\nGruyère cheese. But whether the heated material occupy the whole or\r\nonly parts of the internal area, is not of much consequence to the\r\npractical geologist; he is content to believe that it exists, and in\r\nsufficient quantity, too, to produce the most momentous changes on\r\nthe surface of the earth. We see the effects of this subterraneous\r\nagent in earthquakes and volcanoes, and the geologist can tell us\r\nof similar, as well as of other changes, effected by it during past\r\nages. Granite hills, and mountainous districts of mica-slate and\r\ngneiss, bear evidence of what is termed _metamorphism_--a change in\r\nthe mineral structure of rocks, believed to have taken place through\r\nthe agency of heat deep in the interior of the earth; for no analogous\r\nappearances have been detected in progress at the surface. Such rocks,\r\nknown as _metamorphic_, or _hypogene_, still form a difficult problem,\r\nnot likely to be satisfactorily solved until the chemist shall have\r\nthoroughly investigated the subject; for it seems likely to be found,\r\nafter all, that long-continued chemical action, without a very alarming\r\ndegree of heat, may have produced even the most intense metamorphism.\r\nBut dropping this part of the subject, in which so much yet remains\r\nto be discovered, let us look for a little at another branch of the\r\ngeologist's evidence, where we meet with no such hampering hypotheses\r\nand doubtful conjectures, namely, the _trap_-rocks.\r\n\r\nEvery one knows that basalt, lava, pumice, scoriæ, and ashes, are\r\nthe various matters ejected from volcanoes. When these materials are\r\nfound interstratified among the various geological formations, they\r\nare termed _trap_-rocks,--a name derived from the Swedish _trappa_, a\r\nstair, in allusion to the step-like or terraced appearance which they\r\noften present. They are of all ages, having been detected in the lower\r\nSilurians of Wales, and in the deposits of all subsequent periods up\r\nto the volcanic eruptions of the present day; thus evidencing, that\r\nfrom the remotest times there have been Ætnas and Vesuvii slumbering\r\nperhaps for ages, and then awakening to lay the surrounding districts\r\nin ruins. I have already said that the rocks from which the geologist\r\nhas to compile his history, are mostly relics of the sea; hence most of\r\nthe trap-rocks which he meets with in his explorations are the products\r\nof submarine eruptions. Far away down among the Silurian rocks, he can\r\ntrace the floor of a primeval ocean thickly covered with stone-lilies,\r\ntrilobites, and molluscs, and in following it out he marks how ashes\r\nand lapilli, ejected from some submarine orifice, settled down amid the\r\norganisms and well-nigh destroyed them, while at other times streams of\r\nmolten matter were poured out along the sea-bottom, and hardened into\r\nmasses of solid rock. He sometimes even encounters what seems the vent\r\nwhence these eruptions proceeded, filled up now by a boss or plug of\r\nhardened trap, but he never can detect any trace of land. Some of these\r\noceanic volcanoes may, like Graham's Island in the Mediterranean, have\r\nraised their tops above water, sending clouds of steam and cinders far\r\nand wide through the air, but the waves would eventually wear down the\r\nnew-born land, and scatter its broken fragments along the floor of the\r\nsea. Among the carboniferous rocks of Scotland, however, we meet with a\r\ndifferent condition of things. There, too, we can trace out submarine\r\nlava-streams, and mark how showers of ashes destroyed the delicate\r\norganisms of the deep; but we encounter, besides, undoubted traces\r\nof a land, not parched and ruinous as though the igneous forces had\r\nlaid it waste for ever, but thickly clothed with vegetation of a more\r\nluxuriant type than that which clusters over Vesuvius and Calabria, or\r\nlies spread out across the \"level plains of fruit-teeming Sicily.\"[74]\r\nWe have looked at the plants and animals of the Carboniferous era; its\r\nrivers and deltas; its slow elevations and depressions of the ground.\r\nIt may, perhaps, complete the picture of that ancient period, if we\r\nexamine, though but briefly, its igneous eruptions, the more especially\r\nsince these may be regarded as, to a considerable extent, typical of\r\ntrap-rocks belonging to every age and every country.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 74: Της καλλικἁρπον Σικελἱας λενροὑς γὑας. Æsch. _Prom.\r\nVinct._ 369--a passage graphically descriptive of an ancient eruption\r\nof Ætna.]\r\n\r\nUnless when deeply buried beneath drift-sand and clay, trappean regions\r\nusually possess scenery of a marked kind. A green undulating country\r\nstretches out as far as the eye can reach, diversified here and there\r\nwith bold abrupt crags and conical hills. The lower grounds show in the\r\nwinter season their rich brown loam, that waxes green as the spring\r\ncomes on, and ere summer's close spreads out its heavy crops of golden\r\ngrain. The higher ridges are for the most part thickly wooded, yet\r\nthe soil is often scanty, and, among the white stems of the beech, or\r\nthe matted roots of the fir and the elm, we may not unfrequently see\r\nthe rock protruding its lichen-crusted face, mottled with mosses and\r\nliverworts, while some sluggish runnel collects in stagnant pools,\r\nor trickles over the blocks with a thick green scum. Sometimes the\r\nhill has never been planted, but stands up now, as it has done for\r\ncenturies; its western face craggy and precipitous, with bushes of\r\nsloe-thorn and furze, and stray saplings of mountain-ash clinging to\r\nthe crevices, while its eastern slope sinks down into the rolling\r\ncountry around with a green lumpy surface, through which, at many a\r\npoint, the grey time-stained rock may be seen. The whole district\r\nsuggests to the fancy a billowy sea, and, as one casts his eye from\r\nsome commanding hill-top athwart the wide expanse of hill and valley,\r\nsweeping away in endless undulations, he is apt to bethink him of\r\nsome day far back in the past, when the verdant landscape around lay\r\nbarren and desolate, while the solid earth rocked and heaved in vast\r\nground-swells like a wide tempested ocean. Such is the aspect presented\r\nby some of the more trappean regions of Scotland. But the origin of\r\nthis kind of scenery must be ascribed to the effects of denuding\r\ncurrents in scooping out the softer strata into clefts and valleys, and\r\nleaving the harder trap-rocks in prominent relief, rather than to any\r\ngreat inequality of surface produced by the eruption of igneous matter;\r\nfor we shall find that the throwing out of sheets of lava and showers\r\nof volcanic ashes was often a very quiet process after all.\r\n\r\nTrap-rocks generally may be variously classified according to the\r\naspect under which we view them. Mineralogically they are _augitic_,\r\nwhen the mineral _augite_ enters largely into their composition;\r\n_hornblendic_, when the _augite_ is replaced by _hornblende_; and\r\n_felspathic_, where _felspar_ forms the most marked constituent.\r\nThe first class includes all the dark homogeneous compounds called\r\n_basalts_; the second, the hornblendic _greenstones_, or _diorites_;\r\nand the third, the _felstones_, _porphyries_, and _tufas_.\r\nGeologically, they are _beds_ when they are interstratified with the\r\ncontiguous rocks; and _dykes_ or _veins_ when they penetrate them like\r\nwalls, or in an irregular manner. The former class may be either of\r\nthe same age with the rocks among which they lie, or of a later date,\r\njust as in a pile of books the centre one may either have been placed\r\nthere originally with the rest, or thrust in long afterwards. The\r\nlatter class must always be later than the rocks which they traverse,\r\nfor it is plain the rocks must have been in existence before trap-dykes\r\nand veins could be shot through them. Hence geologists are accustomed\r\nto speak of contemporaneous and subsequent trap-rocks: the one list\r\nincluding all the tufas, and those melted rocks which can be shown to\r\nhave been erupted during the time when the limestones, sandstones, or\r\nshales around them were forming; the other embracing all the dykes and\r\nveins along with those beds of melted rock which have been intruded\r\nbetween the strata. These and other distinctions will be better\r\nunderstood from a few examples collected chiefly from the carboniferous\r\ndistrict of central Scotland.\r\n\r\nThe trap-rocks seen there exhibit a wide range of structure, texture,\r\ncolour, and general aspect. There are two pretty marked kinds--the\r\naugitic or hornblendic, and the felspathic; the former being usually\r\nof a more or less crystalline aspect; the latter, commonly dull, and\r\noften without any crystals.[75] In the augitic traps, the crystals\r\nare sometimes of large size and well-defined, so that the rock could\r\nhardly be distinguished at first sight from an ordinary grey granite,\r\nwhile at other times, and not unfrequently even in other portions of\r\nthe same mass, the stone assumes a black appearance without distinct\r\ncrystals. The former variety would be called a _greenstone_, the\r\nlatter a _basalt_; the chief components in either case being felspar\r\nand hornblende, or felspar and augite, with a variable admixture\r\nof other minerals, the shade of colour varying from a pale blue or\r\nleek-green, through the different hues of grey, to a deep velvet black.\r\nThere are other traps, however, consisting entirely, or nearly so,\r\nof felspar, whence they are known as _felstones_. Such rocks enjoy\r\na wide range of colour, some of them being pure white, others of a\r\nbluish grey or dingy brown; and they may be seen graduating from a\r\npale yellow, or flesh-colour, to a brick-red or deep purple. When a\r\ntrap displays distinct disseminated crystals, usually of felspar, it\r\nbecomes a _porphyry_; when it shows rounded cavities, like those of\r\nfurnace-slag, it is said to be _vesicular_; and when these globular or\r\nalmond-shaped cavities are filled with carbonate of lime, chalcedony,\r\nor other minerals, the rock forms an _amygdaloid_. Such peculiarities\r\nof structure indicate to some extent the origin of the mass, and may\r\nbe found in any kind of trap. Thus we have porphyritic greenstones,\r\nbasalts, or felstones, and the same rocks may be likewise vesicular\r\nor amygdaloidal. Some of them, such as many greenstones, display on\r\nweathered surfaces that curious spheroidal structure already alluded\r\nto; others are built up into geometric columns.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 75: This distinction, though a sufficiently safe one in\r\nsome localities, must not be held as by any means universal in its\r\napplication, the felspathic traps being often as crystalline in aspect\r\nas the augitic, and the augitic, on the other hand, as dull as the\r\nfelspathic.]\r\n\r\nSuch peculiarities of composition and structure form the basis of\r\na mineralogical classification of the igneous rocks, which is of\r\nuse in working out the geology of a district. The most convenient\r\nsubdivision for our present purpose, however, is that which proceeds\r\nupon the origin and mode of occurrence of the trap-rocks. Viewed\r\nthus, they resolve themselves into two great groups, the _intrusive_\r\nand _contemporaneous_, both of which contain greenstones, basalts,\r\n&c.,--the sole distinction between those of the one class and those of\r\nthe other, being the relation of age and mode of occurrence which they\r\nbear to the surrounding rocks.\r\n\r\nI. The _intrusive_ traps occur in the form of walls and veins,\r\nsometimes in that of flat parallel beds, and often as huge amorphous\r\nmasses, to which no definite name can be given. But whatever shape they\r\nmay assume, they generally agree in presenting well-marked features,\r\nwhereby their origin can be readily ascertained. The rocks through\r\nwhich they pass are more or less hardened, often contorted, and\r\nsometimes traversed by innumerable cracks and rents, into some of which\r\nthe trap has penetrated in the form of veins.\r\n\r\nA trap-dyke is a long wall of igneous matter, cutting more or less\r\nperpendicularly through the surrounding rocks. Sometimes these dykes\r\nattain a breadth of many yards, and may not unfrequently be traced for\r\nmiles running in a nearly straight line over hill and valley, easily\r\nrecognisable by a long smooth ridge, with the rock protruding here and\r\nthere from below where the soil is thin. It is interesting to follow\r\nout one of these long ramparts from its beginning to its close, and\r\nmark how undeviatingly it cuts through the rocks. No matter what may\r\nbe the nature of the stone encountered, hard conglomerate, friable\r\nshale, compact limestone, or jointed fissile sandstone, all are broken\r\nacross, and the right line preserved throughout. Nay, I have seen a\r\nstill more curious instance of this persistency, where the dyke ran for\r\nfour miles through a set of mountain limestone and lower coal-measure\r\nstrata, and several enormous sheets of greenstone and basalt. Even\r\nwhen passing through these traps the dyke remained perfectly distinct,\r\nits crystalline structure and external configuration presenting a\r\nwell-marked contrast with those of the surrounding eminences. Of\r\ncourse it must have been formed after all the rocks through which\r\nit passed. The sandstones and shales must have settled down long\r\npreviously on some estuary bed or sea-bottom; the corals and shells\r\nof the limestones, and the matted plants of the successive coal-seams\r\nmust have lived and died, perhaps thousands or millions of years\r\nbefore, and their remains have hardened into stone, ere the continuity\r\nof the strata was broken across by the long deep wall of greenstone.\r\nTrap-dykes are accordingly appropriately termed _intrusive_. They\r\nhave been intruded among and must always be later than the rocks in\r\nwhich they occur. In tracing out their character, more especially in a\r\ntrappean district, such as that of Linlithgowshire, where they abound,\r\nwe soon find other evidence of their intrusive nature. Where they pass\r\nthrough limestone, they sometimes convert it into a white saccharine\r\nmarble; shales they bake into a sort of porcelain or burnt pottery; and\r\nsandstones become semi-fused into a hard homogeneous quartz-rock. Nor\r\nare the changes confined to the rocks traversed; the dykes themselves,\r\nalong their sides, become fine grained and hardened; occasionally, too,\r\nthe colour alters from the usual bluish or greenish-grey to black, or\r\nto a brick-red, or dull-brown, similar to that of the altered shale\r\nand sandstone, of which detached portions may be found adhering to\r\nthe outer walls of the dyke, or even embedded in its substance.\r\nThe central portion of the dyke may thus be markedly crystalline,\r\nforming what we should call a greenstone, while the outside parts,\r\nwhere the trap comes in contact with the adjacent rocks, are fine\r\ngrained and homogeneous, so as to become a true basalt. Sometimes,\r\ntoo, these exterior edges are highly vesicular and amygdaloidal,\r\ndetached fragments closely resembling the slag of an iron-furnace, and\r\noccasionally the dyke presents a columnar arrangement, the ends of\r\nthe hexagonal or polygonal columns abutting against the sandstone or\r\nother rock on either side, and losing themselves towards the centre in\r\nthe general mass of the trap. Where the strata traversed are broken\r\nand jointed, the dykes which cut them through may be seen in some\r\nplaces throwing out lateral veins that accommodate themselves to all\r\nthe irregularities of the fissures. These minor portions exhibit for\r\nthe most part the same leading features with the parent mass, and the\r\nresult of the whole is a general baking of the beds, with sometimes not\r\na little contortion, and an amount of irregularity and disturbance,\r\napparent at once to the most inexperienced observer. (See Fig. 34.)\r\n\r\nIf the reader will verify these statements by actual exploration in\r\nthe field, he will probably not be long in arriving at the following\r\nconclusions: trap-dykes must once have been in a melted state, as is\r\nshown by their vesicular cavities and divergent veins; this liquid\r\ncondition must have been attended with the most intense heat, as may be\r\ngathered from the burnt and baked appearance of the contiguous rocks;\r\nthey have, for the most part, especially where of large size, risen\r\nfrom below along previously-formed dislocations--a circumstance which\r\nmay be inferred from their persistency in a straight line through beds\r\nof very different resisting power, for had the liquid matter forced\r\na way for itself, it would have squirted between the beds along the\r\nlines of least resistance, and not directly and for miles across them;\r\nand hence, trap-dykes must be regarded not as themselves the agents\r\nin dislocating and contorting a district, but merely as signs of the\r\nparent force at work below.\r\n\r\nAll the features of these trap-dykes here stated may be observed in the\r\ncentral district of Scotland, among rocks of Carboniferous age. But he\r\nwho would study trap-dykes on the great scale without quitting Britain,\r\nshould visit some of the more trappean islands of the Hebrides. He\r\nwill there find them intersecting glen and hill-side, in an intricate\r\nnetwork, standing up through the heather like ruined walls, and running\r\noften for considerable distances up bald cliff-line, and across\r\nprecipitous ravine. In some localities, among such limestone districts\r\nas that of Strath, detached eminences may be seen with congregated\r\ndykes coursing their sides and summits, while the heathy interspaces\r\nare cumbered with grey and white protruding blocks of marble, that give\r\nto these green knolls the aspect of old time-wasted abbeys with their\r\nclustering tombstones. The magnificent sections laid open in these\r\nlocalities by the action of mountain streams, and by the waves of the\r\nAtlantic, leave the student of igneous rocks nothing to desire save a\r\nlong lease of leisure.\r\n\r\nAnother form frequently assumed by the intrusive traps, is that of\r\nwide beds or sheets intercalated with greater or less regularity among\r\nstratified rocks (Fig. 34 _b_). They may be regarded as horizontal\r\ndykes, the igneous matter, in place of cutting across the strata,\r\nhaving forced a way for itself between them. Viewed in this light they\r\nwill be found exactly to correspond with ordinary dykes; the rocks on\r\nwhich they rest, and those which lie above them being both altered like\r\nthose on either side of a dyke or vein. A well-known example of this\r\nform of trap is that of Salisbury Crags, where a bed of greenstone\r\ntwenty to eighty feet thick is intercalated among sandstones, shales,\r\nand coarse limestones, belonging to the Lower Carboniferous series. Its\r\nunder surface presents a remarkably even line, broken at intervals,\r\nhowever, where the truncated ends of sandstone beds protrude up\r\ninto the greenstone, or where the latter cuts into the sandstone\r\nbelow, occasionally enveloping detached fragments, and sending veins\r\nthrough them. Along the line of contact both rocks undergo a change.\r\nThe greenstone becomes reddened, finer grained, and of a dull earthy\r\naspect. The sandstones and shales are also red, and excessively hard,\r\nthe former resembling a quartz rock, and the latter passing into a sort\r\nof flinty chert or chalcedony. The sandstones above the trap, where\r\nthey can be examined, are also found to present the same hardened,\r\nbaked appearance, the most intense metamorphism being observable\r\nin those parts which are completely surrounded by igneous matter.\r\nThese points were noted many years ago during the famous controversy\r\nbetween the disciples of Hutton and Werner, the former viewing them\r\nas demonstrative evidence of the igneous origin of the trap-rock, the\r\nlatter, on the other hand, professing to see nothing in the section\r\nof the Crags at all militating against the theory that the rocks had\r\noriginated from deposition in water. Many a battle was fought in this\r\nlocality, and not a few of the trap-dykes and hills possess to the\r\ngeologist a classic interest, from having been the examples whence\r\nsome of the best established geological opinions were first deduced.\r\nThe contest between the Huttonians and Wernerians terminated long ago\r\nin the acknowledged victory of the former; Hutton's doctrines are now\r\nrecognised all over the world. It is interesting, however, to walk\r\nover the scenes of the warfare, and mark the very rocks among which it\r\nraged, and from the peculiarities of which it took its rise. Basalts\r\nand greenstones, sandstones and shales, with all their crumplings and\r\ncontortions, still stand up as memorials of powerful igneous action,\r\nand of physical changes in the primeval past; and they have become to\r\nthe geologist memorials, too, of changes in the onward progress of his\r\nscience, where, out of conflicts perhaps yet more tumultuous than those\r\nof ancient Nature, there emerged at last the clear demonstrable truth.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 34.--Intrusive Trap.]\r\n\r\nIn the accompanying section (Fig. 34), the more marked characters of\r\nintrusive traps are exhibited. The main mass of igneous rock is the\r\ndyke (_d_), rising through a dislocation or fault, which has thrown\r\ndown the beds on one side several feet below those on the other, as\r\nis shown by the interruption of the shale and ironstone beds (_sh_).\r\nThe dyke gives off two ramifications, one of them cutting across the\r\nbeds obliquely as a vein (_v_); the other passing along the planes\r\nof the shaly layers as a horizontal bed (_b_). The vein, it will be\r\nnoticed, produces considerable alteration in its progress, carrying up\r\nand baking a portion of the shale (_sh_), and turning up the edges of\r\nthe beds on both sides, which get cracked and hardened along the line\r\nof contact. The bed runs with some regularity for a short distance\r\nthrough the shales, which show marks of great alteration at their\r\njunction with the trap. Its under surface at one point is seen to have\r\ninvolved a portion of the shale which has become in consequence highly\r\nmetamorphosed, while along the upper surface the bed has sent out a\r\nshort irregular vein that twists and otherwise alters the shales\r\nabove. These circumstances would suffice to show that even though we\r\ndid not find this bed in connexion with a mass of intrusive trap, it\r\nmust, nevertheless, have been thrust among previously-formed strata,\r\nand could not have been contemporaneous, that is, poured out along the\r\nsea-bottom before the shales above it were deposited.\r\n\r\nBut one other form needs to be mentioned here as characteristic of the\r\nCarboniferous intrusive trap-rocks--that of great amorphous masses\r\nwhich cut through the strata irregularly. They have not the wall-like\r\nform of dykes, nor do they conform to the line of bedding of the rocks\r\namong which they occur. They are sometimes irregular lumps, lying\r\nabove or among the strata, and probably connected with some vein or\r\ndyke below. In other localities they look like the upper ends of vast\r\npillars which may descend into the very depths of Tartarus, as though a\r\ngreat hole had been blown through the crust of the earth, and a column\r\nof melted matter had risen to fill the cavity. Such masses are often\r\ncalled _bosses_, and seem not unfrequently to have been the craters\r\nof eruption whence great sheets of lava and showers of ashes were\r\nejected far and wide over the neighbourhood. They serve to connect\r\nthe intrusive traps, whose age is always more or less uncertain, with\r\nthe bedded traps properly so called, the geological date of which can\r\nusually be sufficiently ascertained.\r\n\r\nII. The bedded or contemporaneous trap-rocks consist of two well-marked\r\nkinds. There are, 1st, the melted rocks, such as greenstones and\r\nbasalts and 2d, the tufas and volcanic ashes.\r\n\r\nThose of the first-named class differ in no respect from the traps\r\nalready noticed, so far as regards mineralogical texture, general\r\nstructure, and appearance. In hand specimens the intrusive and bedded\r\ngreenstones and basalts cannot be distinguished, nor even when examined\r\nin the field and in masses extending over considerable areas is it\r\nalways possible to say to which division any particular hill or crag\r\nshould be assigned. The reason of this resemblance is obvious. Where a\r\ntrap has either cut through or insinuated itself among rocks of earlier\r\ndate it is called intrusive, in relation to the rocks so traversed,\r\nand of course we cannot be sure to what geological period it should be\r\nreferred, nor how long an interval may have elapsed between the time\r\nwhen these rocks were forming and the time when the trap was intruded\r\namong them. If, however, the igneous rock passed upward through these\r\nsame strata and then spread out as a flat sheet along the sea-bottom,\r\nthe part that came to the top would be termed contemporaneous\r\nwith the deposits going on at the time. Hence it follows that all\r\ncontemporaneous lava-form trap-rocks are at the same time intrusive as\r\nregards the strata passed through in their progress to the surface. If\r\nthe sheet of melted matter that spread out below the water were in the\r\ncourse of ages worn completely away, along with the strata subsequently\r\npiled above it, so as to leave merely a neck or dyke filling up the\r\ncavity through which the lava rose, we should pronounce the remnant\r\nintrusive, and could form no certain conclusion as to its age or\r\nas to whether its site had ever been a crater actively at work in\r\nthrowing out lava and ashes. The sole difference, therefore, between a\r\ncontemporaneous and an intrusive greenstone is simply this: the former\r\nrose through a fissure until it reached the surface, and then rolled\r\nout as a flat parallel sheet; the latter may have been erupted from\r\nbelow at the same time, yet, owing to different circumstances, never\r\nreached the surface, but spread out among or cut through the strata\r\nunderneath. And so, when we come to examine in quarries, ravines, and\r\nother exposures, the remains of two such eruptions, we soon ascertain\r\nthe relative age of the former from that of the strata among which it\r\noccurs, but as to the date of the latter we are wholly at a loss, for\r\nit gives us no clue by which we can show whether it was erupted before\r\nor after the other. We can but compare the mineralogical character\r\nof the intruded with that of the contemporaneous masses in the same\r\ndistrict, and, from the resemblance which may be traced between them,\r\ndraw at the best but a doubtful inference as to their relative dates.\r\n\r\nThe contemporaneous traps always assume a bedded form, the intrusive\r\noccasionally do so; and the question naturally arises here, what are\r\nthe tests whereby a bed of trap may be known to be contemporaneous and\r\nnot intrusive? The answer is happily a simple one. An intrusive mass\r\nis found to alter to a greater or less extent the rocks in contact\r\nwith it; if it occur as a dyke, then the beds on either side have\r\nbeen cut through and probably otherwise affected; if it take the form\r\nof a bed or sheet, the strata lying above and below it will be found\r\nto be both altered, showing evidently that a heated mass has been\r\ninterposed between them, and consequently that the igneous rock is of\r\nlater date than any of the strata among which it occurs. In the case\r\nof a contemporaneous melted trap, however, the appearances presented\r\nare different; it always takes the form of a flat bed corresponding\r\nto all the inclinations and curvatures of the sandstones, shales,\r\nlimestones, or other strata among which it lies. If examined carefully,\r\nit may be found not unfrequently baking and contorting the bed that\r\nforms its pavement, but producing no change whatever on that which\r\ncomposes its roof. It may be capped and underlaid by layers of shale,\r\nand in such a case we might not improbably find the shale below it\r\nhighly baked, so as to resemble a sort of rude pottery, while the shale\r\nabove would present no sign of such metamorphism, but on the contrary\r\nmight display its delicate plants or shells down to the very surface\r\nof the trap, and were the latter concealed from view we should never\r\nsuspect, from the aspect of this shale, that any igneous rock existed\r\nin the neighbourhood. The inference to be drawn from such appearances\r\nseems very obvious. Had the upper shale been in existence when the\r\ngreenstone or basalt was erupted, it would have suffered an alteration\r\nsimilar to that produced on the shale below; and the fact, plain and\r\npalpable, that it has undergone no such change, shows pretty clearly\r\nthat it was deposited at the bottom of the water after the trap had\r\ncooled and consolidated, and that consequently the trap must be\r\nintermediate in age between the beds on which it rests and those which\r\nlie above it; in other words, that it is a _contemporaneous_ rock.\r\nHence, if we know the exact geological position and age of the shales,\r\nwe know also those of the associated trap, and can thus ascertain\r\nthat at a certain definite period in the past history of our planet a\r\nparticular district was the scene of volcanic action.\r\n\r\nExamples of such contemporaneous traps abound among the carboniferous\r\nrocks of central Scotland, especially in Fife and the Lothians (Fig.\r\n35). I may refer again to the vicinity of Edinburgh as affording some\r\nexcellent illustrations. The eastern part of Arthur's Seat displays\r\na series of basalts and greenstones which can be proved to have been\r\nthrown out during the times of the Lower Carboniferous rocks, at a\r\nperiod long anterior to that of the Burdiehouse limestone. The Pentland\r\nHills exhibit on a much greater scale vast sheets of felspathic traps,\r\nsuch as felstones and tufas, traceable in some cases for six or seven\r\nmiles, which were erupted at a still earlier period.[76] The trap\r\npebbles in our boulder consisted of light yellow and pink felstone,\r\nand were derived, I make no doubt, from these Pentland Hill beds, when\r\nwhat forms now the cone of Carnethy, rising well-nigh 1900 feet above\r\nthe sea, existed as one of a scattered archipelago of islets, or as a\r\nsunken rock battered by the waves that scattered its shingle along the\r\nfloor of what may have been either a shallow sea or a shoaling estuary,\r\nwhere eventually the sand and pebbles hardened into that bed of coarse\r\ngrey sandstone whence our boulder was derived.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 76: The geology of Arthur's Seat and Pentland Hills was\r\nadmirably worked out more than quarter of a century ago by Mr. M'Laren.\r\nHis work (already referred to) is unfortunately now out of print.]\r\n\r\nThe second class of contemporaneous trap-rocks are the tufas or\r\nvolcanic ashes. They differ entirely in their aspect and origin from\r\nany of the rocks already described. Greenstones, basalts, felstones,\r\nand such like, were all melted rocks, thrust up from below as we see\r\nlava thrown out by a modern volcano, being styled contemporaneous when\r\npoured out along the sea-bottom or the land, and intrusive when they\r\nnever reached the surface but cut through the strata below. The tufas,\r\nhowever, point to a totally different origin. They are of various\r\nshades of colour, according to their chemical composition. In East\r\nLothian they assume a deep red hue; among the Pentland Hills they\r\nare often flesh-coloured, while in Linlithgowshire they range from a\r\ndull-brown to a pale leek-green, green being the prevailing tint. They\r\nalways show a dull uncrystalline surface, irregularly roughened by\r\nincluded fragments of various rocks, such as trap, sandstone, shale,\r\nand many others. These fragments or _lapilli_ vary in size from less\r\nthan a pin-head up to large bombs of several hundredweight, and from\r\nbeing generally abundant give to the tufas one of their best-marked\r\ncharacteristics. The smaller pieces are usually more or less angular,\r\nand throughout the carboniferous series of Linlithgowshire consist\r\nchiefly of a pale felspathic matter, lighter in shade and commonly\r\nharder in texture than the matrix or paste in which they lie. In\r\nsome localities, where the included pieces are larger, they have a\r\nrounded form, and often show a honey-combed vesicular surface, like\r\nballs of hardened slag. Fragments of sandstone have not unfrequently\r\na semi-fused appearance, and plates of shale sometimes look like the\r\nbroken debris from a tile-work, although in many instances these\r\nfragments may be found showing no trace whatever of alteration, being\r\nundistinguishable from the neighbouring sandstones and shales from\r\nwhich they probably came. I have seen in some of the coarser tufas, or\r\nrather volcanic conglomerates, enormous masses of basalt and greenstone\r\nburied deep in the surrounding green or red felspathic paste, and\r\nshowing on their more prominent edges the usual vesicular cavities.\r\nIn such conglomerates there is usually no division into beds; the\r\nwhole mass, indeed, forms a bed between lower and higher strata, but\r\ninternally it shows for the most part no trace of stratification. In\r\nthese confused assemblages one may occasionally light upon detached\r\ncrystals of augite or other mineral scattered irregularly through\r\nthe tufa. Their angles will be found often blunted, and the crystals\r\nthemselves broken, appearances which have likewise been noticed among\r\nthe ash of modern volcanoes. When the tufas are finer grained they\r\nusually exhibit a well-marked stratification, and can often be split\r\nup into laminæ like an ordinary fissile sandstone. Organic remains not\r\nunfrequently abound in such laminated beds, and vary in their character\r\nas widely as in any other stratified rock, being sometimes land-plants,\r\nsometimes sea-shells.\r\n\r\nSuch are some of the more obvious characters of the volcanic ashes or\r\ntufas, as developed among the carboniferous rocks of central Scotland.\r\nTheir great varieties of composition and general aspect render them\r\na somewhat difficult set of rocks to master, but when fairly and\r\nfully understood they soon prove themselves to be by far the most\r\ninteresting section of the traps, for one needs seldom to hesitate a\r\nmoment as to their origin or date, while their fossil contents impart\r\nto them an interest all their own. By comparing such rocks with the\r\nconsolidated ash or fine dust and _lapilli_ of a modern volcano, a\r\nremarkable resemblance of external characters is found to subsist; and\r\nthis likeness holds sufficiently close, when pursued into details, to\r\nshow that the ancient and the modern rocks have resulted from the same\r\nsource, that, namely, of volcanic eruption. The ash of active burning\r\nmountains falls down their sides loosely and incoherently, every\r\nsuccessive shower of dust or scoriæ settling without much regularity\r\non those that have gone before. The ash of the old carboniferous\r\neruptions, however, was showered for the most part over the sea or\r\nacross wide shoaling estuaries, at least it is only such portions of\r\nit as fell there that have come down to our day. Settling down among\r\nthe mud and sand at the bottom, the volcanic matter accumulated in\r\nwide horizontal beds, every marked inequality being smoothed down by\r\nthe currents until a series of regularly stratified layers came to be\r\nformed, entombing any organisms that might find their way to the bottom\r\nor be lying there at the time. The ash of terrestrial volcanoes has no\r\nmarked stratification because thrown out in open air, while that of\r\nthe carboniferous rocks of central Scotland is distinctly bedded from\r\nhaving been deposited under water.\r\n\r\nTufas and contemporaneous melted traps are very generally found\r\ntogether interstratified regularly with each other, and the inference\r\nto be drawn from their juxtaposition is of course simply this, that\r\nat one time liquid lava rolled along the bottom of the water, while\r\nat another showers of volcanic dust and cinders settled down in\r\nsuccessive beds. This active play of the igneous forces took place\r\nat the mouths of estuaries or farther to sea; and it is accordingly\r\nsometimes not a little interesting to trace, amid the sediment that\r\naccumulated below the water during the pauses between the eruptions,\r\nwell-preserved remains now of plants that had come drifting from the\r\nland, anon of slim spirifers, and producti that swarmed upon the\r\nhardened lava-streams, and amid the thickening volcanic mud that\r\nslowly sank to the sea-bottom. Such a sequence of events will be made\r\nplain from the following section, the materials of which are derived\r\nfrom different parts of the trappean region of Linlithgowshire. The\r\nundermost bed here shown (1) is one of marine limestone, abounding\r\nwith encrinal joints, corals, spirifers, and other undoubtedly marine\r\norganisms. Above it comes a layer of tufa or volcanic ash (2) of a\r\ndull green aspect, the boundary line between the two rocks lying as\r\nclear as if the quarryman had marked it off with his foot-rule. The\r\nupper part of the ash, however, does not show an equally clear line\r\nof demarcation with the stratum above. On the contrary, it gradually\r\nchanges its character, becomes more calcareous as it goes up, with\r\nhere and there a stone-lily joint or a stray productus, until these\r\norganisms increase so much in number that the rock insensibly passes\r\ninto an ordinary limestone (3) like that below. Next succeeds a thin\r\nseam of ash (4) resting sharply on the limestone and overlaid by a bed\r\nof shale (5) containing the same marine organisms. Another stratum of\r\nash (6) resembling those below follows the shale, and is surmounted by\r\na close compact greenstone (7) that hardens the ash on which it rests,\r\nbut produces no apparent alteration on the soft fissile shale (8)\r\nabove it. Next is a fourth seam of volcanic ash (9) resembling those\r\nbelow it, but without any shells or crinoidal joints, the only fossils\r\nobservable being a few carbonized stems apparently of calamites and\r\nlepidodendra. Above it comes a bed of white quartzy sandstone (10) with\r\nsimilar vegetable remains, and then a layer of white stiff fire-clay\r\n(11) with rootlets of stigmaria, above which lies a seam of coal (12).\r\nA thin layer of soft blue shale (13) here intervenes, somewhat baked\r\nalong its upper portions by another bed of compact vesicular greenstone\r\n(14), which displays in places a well-marked columnar structure. It is\r\nsurmounted by a highly characteristic ash (15) in which there occur\r\nnumerous large bombs chiefly of trap of different kinds, some of them\r\nhighly vesicular. Fragments of shale also occur, mingled here and there\r\nwith black carbonized fragments of coal-measure plants, but without any\r\nof the shells and other marine organisms so abundant below. The topmost\r\nbed is a grey carbonaceous sandstone (16), underlying a thin covering\r\nof vegetable mould.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 35.--Contemporaneous Trap.]\r\n\r\nSuch is the skeleton, as it were, of the section; the mere dry bones\r\nwhich remain to the geologist, and which he must study closely to\r\nbe able to give them life again. The lowest bed visible, with its\r\nstone-lilies and molluscs, we readily recognise as marking an old\r\nocean-bed, so that the little episode in the primeval records of\r\nour planet here presented to us opens, like the two great epics of\r\nantiquity, within sound of the wide-roaring sea. The seam of ash which\r\nfollows shows, from the sharpness of its line of demarcation with the\r\nlimestone, how the denizens of the sea-bottom were suddenly destroyed\r\nby a thick shower of volcanic dust that settled down over their\r\nremains. The waters, however, soon cleared, and ere long stone-lilies\r\nand producti were plentiful as ever, mingling their remains among the\r\nupper layers of the soft muddy ash, and giving rise therefrom to a\r\nsort of calcareous ash or ashy limestone, until in the course of time\r\nthe volcanic matter became wholly covered over by a seam of ordinary\r\nlimestone. The corals and stone-lilies were, however, anew destroyed\r\nby the deposition of volcanic dust that settled over them as a seam\r\nof ash, after which the water was again rendered turbid and muddy by\r\nthe inroad of foreign matter, which, brought down by rivers or by the\r\nchanging currents of the ocean, sank to the bottom and eventually\r\nconsolidated into a seam of shale. Thereafter the volcanic forces\r\nbegan once more to eject a quantity of dust and scoriæ that fell into\r\nthe water and spread along the bottom as a stratum of ash, and to\r\npour out a current of lava which hardened into a great sheet visible\r\nnow as the undermost greenstone of the section. The emission of the\r\nlava seems to have terminated the eruption, for the next stratum is\r\none of shale like that below the ash, so that the muddy sediment,\r\nthe deposition of which was interrupted for a while by the volcanic\r\nproducts, began afresh to settle down along the sea-bottom. This\r\nlast condition of things seems to have continued for a considerable\r\nperiod, seeing that the shale bed is relatively thick, and from its\r\nfissile laminated structure indicates a slow and tranquil deposition.\r\nAnother eruption of volcanic dust and ashes again interrupted the\r\ndetrital deposits, and gave rise to another seam of tufa. This last\r\nsubterranean movement seems to have considerably altered the general\r\ncontour of the sea-bottom, and so elevated it, at least at one part,\r\nthat a thick accumulation of sand, and subsequently of clay, filled\r\nit up to the level of the water or nearly so, giving rise to a dense\r\ngrowth of the stigmaria and other coal-measure plants whose roots are\r\nstill seen imbedded in the fire-clay on which, as a soft muddy soil,\r\nthey originally grew. It is probable, however, that, notwithstanding\r\nsuch elevations of the sea-bed, there was a general subsidence of the\r\nground during the accumulation of these strata, for we see that the\r\npeaty morass, represented now by the coal-seam, ere long sank beneath\r\nthe waters, with the inroads of which it was unable to keep pace, while\r\nthere slowly silted over it a muddy sediment that hardened at length\r\ninto what is now a seam of shale. But this order of things had been in\r\nexistence for but a comparatively short period when the igneous forces\r\nbroke out again, ejecting a stream, of molten lava that spread along\r\nthe bottom of the shallow waters and hardened as before into a sheet\r\nof greenstone. This was followed by an abundant shower of dust and\r\nlapilli, along with numerous large masses of greenstone and basalt.\r\nThese falling into the water accumulated on the upper surface of the\r\nlava-stream, then somewhat cooled, and formed in the end a stratum of\r\nash of a rubbly conglomeritic aspect. That the sheet of greenstone\r\nreally spread out along the sea-bottom before the ejection of the ash,\r\nand was not intruded among the beds at a later period,--that, in short,\r\nit must be regarded as a contemporaneous and not as an intrusive rock,\r\nseems sufficiently shown by its great regularity and evenness, and by\r\nthe unaltered condition of the fine soft felspathic matter which covers\r\nits upper surface. It was assuredly in a highly-heated condition when\r\npoured out, as may be gathered from the baked aspect of the mud over\r\nwhich it rolled; but it had cooled and solidified, at least along its\r\nupper surface, ere buried beneath the shower of ashes. The last bed\r\nexhibited in the section is a grey sandstone, with many carbonaceous\r\nstreaks and traces of land-plants, showing a pause in the volcanic\r\nactivity of the district, during which the streams from the land\r\nbrought down sandy sediment, with an abundant admixture of macerated\r\nleaves, branches, and other drift-wood.\r\n\r\nIt thus appears that not only were the plains and hills of the\r\nCarboniferous era richly clothed with vegetation, and its waters\r\ncrowded with animals, but that then, as now, subterranean forces were\r\nat work, sometimes elevating, sometimes depressing the area alike of\r\nthe land and of the sea; while, not unfrequently, melted lava rose\r\nfrom below, rolling along the bottom of the waters, and showers of\r\nashes were flung far and wide through the air, settling at last as a\r\nthickening sediment along the floor of the sea, or athwart the marshy\r\nswamps of the delta. Whether the interior of the land had burning cones\r\namong its pine-covered hills we know not yet. Such, however, probably\r\nexisted; nay, there may have been among the higher peaks some \"snowy\r\npillar of heaven,\" like the Ætna of Pindar, raising its smoking summit\r\namong everlasting crags of ice in solitudes lifeless and bare.[77]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 77: The highest points of New Zealand, nearly 10,000 feet\r\nabove the sea, are said to be clothed for two-thirds of their height\r\nwith ice and snow. If, therefore, during Carboniferous times, there\r\nexisted somewhere to the west of what is now central Scotland, a chain\r\ncf hills 5000 or 6000 feet high, their summits might perhaps have been\r\nas wintry us that of Mont Blanc.]\r\n\r\nOur boulder has served us like the minstrels in modern Gothic\r\npoetry, who appear between the cantos, and give an air of unity and\r\ncompleteness to what would otherwise be often rambling and unconnected.\r\nAnd now, at the close, it comes again before us, lying in its bed of\r\nclay, clustered with mosses of brightest green, and overshadowed by its\r\nflickering canopy of beechen leaves. Silent and senseless, the emblem,\r\nseemingly, of calm repose and unchanging durability, what could we have\r\nconceived it should have to chronicle, save the passing, perchance, of\r\nmany a wintry December and many a sultry June. Such, indeed, would be\r\nthe character of its records of the centuries that have passed away\r\nsince the birth of man, did any such record survive in its keeping.\r\nBut it rests there as the memorial of far earlier centuries, and of\r\nan older creation; and though now surrounded with all that is lovely\r\nor picturesque--the twinkling flowers on every side, the wide arch of\r\nboughs overhead, and the murmuring streamlet in the dell below--and\r\nthough forming itself no unimpressive object in the scene, the boulder\r\nlooks out upon us unconnected with anything around. Like a sculptured\r\nobelisk transported from the plains of Assyria to the streets of\r\nLondon, it offers no link of association with the order of things\r\naround it; its inscriptions are written in hieroglyphics long since\r\nextinct, but of which the key yet remains to show us that the rocks of\r\nour planet are not masses of dead, shapeless matter, but chronicles of\r\nthe past; and that all the varied beauty of green field and waving wood\r\nis but a thin veil of gossamer spread out over the countless monuments\r\nof the dead. We have raised one little corner of this gauze-like\r\ncovering, and tried to decipher the memorials of bygone creations,\r\ntraced in clear and legible characters on the boulder. First, there\r\nlies spread out before us a wide arctic sea, studded with icebergs\r\nthat come drifting from the north. Here and there a bare barren islet\r\nrises above the waste of waters, and the packed ice-floes often strand\r\nalong its shores, while at other parts great towering bergs, aground\r\nin mid-ocean, keep rising and falling with the heavings of the surge,\r\nand seem ever on the verge of toppling into the deep. But this scene,\r\nso bleak and lifeless, erelong fades away, and we can descry a wide\r\narchipelago of islands, green well-nigh to the water's edge, and\r\nlooking like the higher hill-tops of some foundered continent. The\r\nwaves are actively at work wearing down the shores, which present for\r\nthe most part an abrupt cliff-line to the west. This picture, too,\r\ngets gradually dim, and when the darkness and haze have cleared away,\r\nthe scene is wholly new. For miles around there spreads out an expanse\r\nof water, like a wide lake, thickly dotted with islets of every form\r\nand size, clothed with a rich vegetation. Here a jungle of tall reeds\r\nshoots out of the water, clustering with star-like leaves; there a\r\ngroup of graceful trees, fluted like the columns of an ancient temple,\r\nand crowned by a coronal of sweeping fronds, spread out their roots\r\namid the soft mud. Yonder lies a drier islet, rolling with ferns of\r\nevery shape and size, with here and there a lofty tree-fern, waving its\r\nmassive boughs high overhead. The vegetation, rank and luxuriant in the\r\nextreme, strikes us as different from anything visible at the present\r\nday, though, as our eyes rest on the muddy discoloured current, we\r\ncan mark, now and then, huge trunks, branchless and bare, that recall\r\nsome of the living pine-trees. The denizens of the water seem to be\r\nequally strange. Occasionally a massive head, with sharp formidable\r\ntusks, peers above the surface, and then the gleam of fins and scales\r\nreveals a creature some twenty or thirty feet long. Glancing down into\r\nthe clearer spots, we can detect many other forms of the finny tribes,\r\nall cased in a strong glistening armature of scales, and darting\r\nabout with ceaseless activity. Beyond this scene of almost tropical\r\nluxuriance, on the one side, lies the blue ocean, with its countless\r\nshells and corals, its stone-lilies and sea-urchins, and its large\r\npredaceous fish; on the other side stretches a far-off chain of hills,\r\nwhose nether slopes, dark with pine-woods, sweep down into the rich\r\nalluvial plains. And then this landscape, too, fades slowly away, and\r\nthick darkness descends upon us. Yet through the gloom we feel ever\r\nand anon the rambling earthquake, and see in the distance the glare\r\nof some active volcano that throws a ruddy gleam amid the pumice and\r\nashes, ever dancing along the surface of the sea. And now this last\r\nscene melts away like the rest, and dark night comes down in which we\r\ncan detect no ray of light, and beyond which we cannot go. The record\r\nof the boulder can conduct us no further into the history of the past.\r\n\r\nThe same principles which have been pursued in the previous pages in\r\nelucidating the history of the Carboniferous system, will conduct\r\nthe reader to the true origin and age of any group of rocks he may\r\nencounter, whatever its nature, and wheresoever its locality. Let\r\nhim, therefore, in his country rambles, seek to verify them in valley\r\nand hill-side, by lake and cataract, and along river-course and\r\nsea-shore. Let him not be content with simply admiring the picturesque\r\ngrouping of rock-masses, but rather seek to interpret their origin\r\nand history, tracing them step by step into the past, amid ages long\r\nprior to man. Such a process will give him a yet keener relish for\r\nthe beauties of their scenery, by ever calling up to his mind some of\r\nthose striking contrasts with which geology abounds. In the stillness\r\nof the mountain-glen, he will see on every side traces of the waves of\r\nocean, and when dipping his oars into the unruffled sea among groups\r\nof wasted rocks, miles from shore, he will bethink him, perchance,\r\nof some old forest-covered land, of which these battered islets are\r\nthe sole memorials. His enjoyment of the scenery of nature is thus\r\nincreased manifold, and he carries about with him a power of making\r\neven the tamest landscape interesting. Cowper, in one of his exquisite\r\nletters, remarks,--\"Everything I see in the fields, is to me an object;\r\nand I can look at the same rivulet or at a handsome tree, every day of\r\nmy life, with new pleasure.\" Had the sweet singer of Olney lived to\r\nwitness the results obtained by the geologists whom he satirized, he\r\nwould perhaps have sauntered along the Ouse with a new pleasure, and\r\nhave felt a yet more intense delight in casting his eyes athwart the\r\nbreadth of landscape that spreads out around-the \"Peasant's nest.\"\r\n\r\nSuch, however, are after all only secondary incentives to the study of\r\nthe rocks. As a mental exercise, geology certainly yields to none of\r\nthe other sciences, for it addresses itself at once to the reasoning\r\npowers and to the imagination, and may thus be made a source both\r\nof intellectual training and of delightful recreation. Of none of\r\nthe sciences is it so easy to get a general smatter, yet none is so\r\ndifficult thoroughly to master, for geology embraces all the sciences.\r\nIn so wide a field, the student will therefore find ample room to\r\nexpatiate. In beginning the study, he may perhaps think it, as Milton\r\npictured the other paths of learning, \"laborious, indeed, at the first\r\nascent; but else so smooth, so green, so full of goodly prospects and\r\nmelodious sounds on every side, that the harp of Orpheus was not more\r\ncharming.\" If time and taste disincline him to travel over the whole\r\nof the broad field, there are delightful nooks to which he may betake\r\nhimself, replete with objects of beauty and interest, where he may\r\nspend his leisure, and by so doing not merely delight himself, but\r\nenlarge the bounds of human knowledge. No part of the domain can be too\r\nobscure or remote to reward his attention; no object too trifling or\r\ninsignificant: for the march of science, though a stately one, proceeds\r\nnot by strides, but by steps often toilsome and slow; and she stands\r\nmainly indebted for her progress not to the genius of a few gigantic\r\nintellects, but to the united efforts of many hundred labourers, each\r\nworking quietly in his own limited sphere.\r\n\r\nBut the highest inducement to this study must ever be that so quaintly\r\nput by old Sir Thomas Browne: \"The world was made to be inhabited by\r\nbeasts, but studied and contemplated by man: 'tis the debt of our\r\nreason we owe unto God, and the homage we pay for not being beasts;\r\nwithout this the world is still as though it had not been, or as it\r\nwas before the sixth day, when as yet there was not a creature that\r\ncould conceive or say there was a world.\" Geology lifts off for us the\r\nveil that shrouds the past, and lays bare the monuments of successive\r\ncreations that had come and gone long ere the human race began. She\r\ntraces out the plan of the Divine working during a vast cycle of ages-,\r\nand points out how the past dovetails with the present, and how the\r\nexisting condition of things comes in as but the last and archetypal\r\neconomy in a long progressive series. By thus revealing what has gone\r\nbefore, she enables us more fully to understand what we see around us\r\nnow. Much that is incomplete she restores; much that is enigmatical\r\nshe explains. She teaches us more fully man's true position in the\r\ncreated universe, by showing that in him all the geologic ages meet\r\nthat he is the point towards which creation has ever been tending. How\r\nfar the facts brought to light by geology may bear upon the future,\r\nwill not, perhaps, be solved until that future shall have come. There\r\nis, nevertheless, in the meanwhile, material enough for solemn and\r\nearnest reflection, and as years go by the amount will probably be\r\nalways increasing. For we must ever be only learners here, and when all\r\nearthly titles and distinctions have passed away, and we enter amid the\r\nrealities of another world, we shall carry with us this one common name\r\nalone. It will, perhaps, be then as now, that only\r\n\r\n    \"In contemplation of created things\r\n    By steps we may ascend to God.\"\r\n\r\nAnd it can surely be no unmeet preparation for such a scene, in humble\r\nfaith to read the records of His doings which the Almighty has graven\r\non the rocks around us. Many problems meet us on every hand problems\r\nwhich it seems impossible for us now to solve and as the circle of\r\nscience ever widens, its enveloping circumference of difficulty and\r\ndarkness widens in proportion. It is, doubtless, well that it should be\r\nso; for we are thus taught to regard our present state as imperfect and\r\nincomplete, and to long for that higher and happier one promised by the\r\nRedeemer to those that love Him, when \"we shall know thoroughly even as\r\nwe are thoroughly known.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLE OF FOSSILIFEROUS ROCKS.\r\n\r\nLYELL'S _Elements_, p. 109.\r\n\r\n   1.
