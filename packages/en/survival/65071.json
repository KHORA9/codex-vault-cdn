NAVY (RETIRED)\r\n  Who has written the Foreword of this biography]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               FOREWORD\r\n\r\n\r\nI believe that the most instructive form of reading is biography. In\r\nthe story of a man’s life one can see in quick review the struggle that\r\nman went through to attain or to fail to attain his heart’s desire.\r\n\r\nFor the professional man, life stories of his colleagues and\r\npredecessors focus down to the particular problems of the profession.\r\nThis is essentially the case with the story of a man like Maury. As\r\na naval officer, Maury’s work will always remain outstanding. He was\r\none of our pioneer investigators of the geography of the sea and the\r\nphysics of the air. And at the same time he never lost sight of the\r\nintrinsic needs of his Service.\r\n\r\nSince travel in the present age has become so common Maury may be\r\nlooked upon as one of our great benefactors. His professional work\r\nturned out to be of happily wide application, not only for the\r\nseafaring man, but for the flier.\r\n\r\nAs an inspirational character Maury was also a noteworthy American. His\r\nlife was marked by that persistent industry peculiar to the successful\r\nresearch worker. There is little indication that he ever saw ahead of\r\nhim immediate reward of any great size. But his toil was ever directly\r\napplied for the adventure of discovering something new or different in\r\nthe maritime fields in which he worked.\r\n\r\nBecause I am soon to start on my own expedition towards the South\r\nPole I am particularly interested in a letter Maury wrote under date\r\nof August 20, 1860, in which he said: “I have reason to believe that\r\nthere is, about the South Pole, a comparatively mild climate. The\r\nunexplored regions there embrace an area equal in extent to about\r\none-sixth of all the known land on the surface of the earth. I am\r\nquietly seeking to create in the minds of some an interest upon the\r\nsubject, hoping thereby to foster a desire in right quarters for an\r\nAntarctic expedition.”\r\n\r\n                                              RICHARD E. BYRD\r\n                                  _Commander, U. S.

Aerology is in its infancy.\r\n\r\nNo other life of this distinguished naval officer and scientist has\r\nbeen published in America and the author has spent the greater part of\r\nfour years in its preparation.\r\n\r\nTo Commander Byrd the author and the publisher are indebted for the\r\nForeword.\r\n\r\nTo the Hydrographic Office, Navy Department, appreciation for\r\nassistance and advice rendered is expressed.\r\n\r\nThat MAURY’S fame and honor may ever grow greater and that his life’s\r\nwork may be an inspiration for a future PATHFINDER OF THE AIR appears\r\na sufficient reason for the publication of this biography by his\r\nbrother officers of the NAVY.\r\n\r\n                                        UNITED STATES NAVAL INSTITUTE\r\n\r\nSeptember 27, 1927\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                PREFACE\r\n\r\n\r\nThis biography is based chiefly upon the Maury Papers, comprising\r\nletters, diaries, scientific notebooks, and other manuscripts, which\r\nwere presented to the United States Government in 1912 by Maury’s only\r\nliving child, Mrs. Mary Maury Werth, and other descendants, and then\r\ndeposited in the Division of Manuscripts, Library of Congress. Other\r\nvaluable sources are the letter books, numbering many volumes, in the\r\nOffice of the Superintendent of the United States Naval Observatory\r\nin Washington, and the official papers relating to Maury in the Navy\r\nDepartment Library. Miscellaneous Maury letters are to be found in the\r\nNew York Public Library, the Public Library of the City of Boston,\r\nthe United States Naval Academy Museum, the Peabody Institute Library\r\nof Baltimore, the Virginia State Library, the Virginia Historical\r\nSociety Library, and the Yale University Library. Mrs. C. Alphonso\r\nSmith, Raleigh, North Carolina, has one Maury letter and some fifty\r\nothers, written by contemporaries in reference to the Maury Testimonial\r\nwhich was presented to him in England after the Civil War. Of great\r\nimportance, also, are Maury’s own voluminous writings, and the numerous\r\nreferences to him in the periodicals and newspapers of his time.\r\n\r\nFor assistance in gathering material for this biography I wish to\r\nacknowledge my indebtedness to various members of the Maury family.\r\nIn the first place, I wish to mention the “Life of Maury” by his\r\ndaughter, Diana Fontaine Maury Corbin, which was of considerable\r\nhelp to me. Of his living descendants, Mrs. James Parmelee, a\r\ngranddaughter, of Washington, D. C., and Mrs. Matthew Fontaine Maury,\r\nJr., a daughter-in-law, of Cincinnati, Ohio gave me much assistance.\r\nMrs. Werth of Richmond, Virginia, and her two daughters, Mrs. N.\r\nMontgomery Osborne of Norfolk, Virginia, and Mrs. Littleton Fitzgerald\r\nof Richmond, very patiently answered my numerous questions and\r\nfurnished me interesting and very desirable information. The list of\r\nall the other persons who have helped me, in one way or another, in\r\nthe writing of this book would be too long to set down in a preface;\r\nbut among the many I wish to single out by name the following: Mr. J.\r\nC. Fitzpatrick, Assistant Chief, Division of Manuscripts, Library of\r\nCongress; Captain Edwin T. Pollock, U. S. Navy, Superintendent, and Mr.\r\nWilliam D.

While his own country was but meagerly, and sometimes\r\ngrudgingly, rewarding him, there was hardly a civilized foreign country\r\nthat did not bestow upon him some mark of distinguished consideration.\r\nThis was not merely a case of distance lending enchantment to the view,\r\nbut rather one of perspective; those near him with but few exceptions\r\nhad only a partial and incomplete view of the man, while foreigners at\r\na distance saw the complete figure of the great scientist unobscured by\r\nthe haze of professional jealousy or political and sectional prejudice.\r\nBut there is another kind of perspective,—that produced by the\r\nlapse of time; hence it is that we now are enabled to appreciate the\r\ngreatness of a man irrespective of the side he took in the War between\r\nthe States in those “unhappy things and battles long ago”. It is this\r\nperspective of time that makes possible the writing of this biography\r\nwith the confidence that the time has now come when throughout our\r\nentire country Maury’s greatness as a scientist and as a man will be\r\nseen in its true proportions, and his fine struggle against obstacles\r\nto attain his ideals and accomplish his purposes will serve as an\r\ninspiration and a challenge to every American.\r\n\r\nWhatever the obstacles were that Maury had to contend with, there was\r\nno handicap in his ancestry, for he was distinctively well-born.\r\nThrough his father, Richard Maury, he was descended from a very\r\ndistinguished Huguenot family which came to Virginia in 1718. His\r\nmother, Diana Minor, was of Dutch ancestry, being descended from Dudas\r\nMinor, who received in 1665 a grant of land in Virginia from King\r\nCharles II. The Minors intermarried with the colonial aristocracy of\r\nthe Old Dominion, and there was accordingly added to the mixed Huguenot\r\nand Dutch ancestry of Matthew Fontaine Maury some of the best English\r\nblood in the colonies. Thus it was that he inherited pride of family,\r\nan inclination to scholarly pursuits, a deeply religious nature, and\r\nthe character and bearing of a gentleman.\r\n\r\nMatthew Fontaine Maury was born, the fourth son in a large family of\r\nfive sons and four daughters, on January 14, 1806, on his father’s\r\nfarm near Fredericksburg, Virginia, and named after his paternal\r\ngreat-grandfathers. There had been many migrations from Spottsylvania\r\nand Albemarle counties to the free lands of the Old Southwest; and\r\nwhen Matthew was but five years old, his father determined to attempt\r\nto better his fortunes by following his uncle, Abram Maury, who had\r\nalready established himself on the Tennessee frontier. Practically no\r\ndetails as to the incidents that occurred on this long and toilsome\r\ntrek have been preserved; but there is a tradition in the family that\r\nall the goods and chattels were transported in wagons, and that, when\r\nlittle Matthew grew tired of walking or cramped from riding in the\r\nrough, jolting wagons, he was frequently carried on the back of one\r\nof his sisters. Their experiences were, no doubt, similar to those of\r\nthousands of other early pioneers who went to the Old Southwest to lay\r\nthe foundations of new commonwealths.\r\n\r\nThe travel-worn family established a new home near Franklin, Tennessee,\r\nsome eighteen miles north of Nashville. This section of the country\r\nwas then on the outskirts of the western frontier, and it was in such\r\nan environment that young Maury spent the most formative years of his\r\nlife. As a lad, he had to take his share of the burdensome work on the\r\nfarm; and it appears from an incident long afterwards related by his\r\nbrother that he had the distaste for farm work, which is common to\r\nboys. Their father had set them to work picking cotton, and Matthew\r\nshowed his inventiveness by devising a way of shortening their labor.\r\nHe suggested to his brother that they make short work of the cotton\r\npicking by pulling off the cotton balls bodily and cramming them into\r\nan old hollow hickory stump that was full of water. The scheme was a\r\ngood one so long as it was undiscovered, but after a time the watchful\r\neye of their father detected the boys in the act and a flogging was\r\nthe result. The lives of the children on the frontier, however, were\r\nby no means wholly filled with toil. There was ample opportunity to\r\nenjoy out-door sports in all seasons of the year, and indoors the Maury\r\nfamily were not without resources for passing the time pleasantly and\r\nprofitably. There were traditions of culture and even of scholarship in\r\nthe family, and besides it should be remembered that the homes of the\r\nearly settlers were rarely without at least a few good books.\r\n\r\nMaury’s father, having observed that his own father had been too\r\nstern with his children, treated his large family with considerable\r\nindulgence; yet he was strict as to their religious training in the\r\nhome and gathered the children together morning and night each day\r\nto read the Psalter antiphonally. In this way Matthew became so\r\nfamiliar with the Psalms of David that years afterwards he could give a\r\nquotation and cite chapter and verse as though he had the Bible before\r\nhim. This early religious influence later colored all Maury’s thinking\r\nand writing to a very marked degree. His mother, who was known as a\r\nwoman of great decision of character, endowed her son with this same\r\nquality which is so essential to greatness; while her husband passed on\r\nto Matthew much of his amiability and ingenuousness for which he was\r\ngreatly liked throughout the neighborhood.\r\n\r\nMaury received his elementary education in an “Old Field” school,\r\nwhere the seats were made of split logs with peg legs, where there\r\nwere no blackboards and but few books, and where the pupils studied\r\ntheir lessons aloud. This method of study probably led to the custom of\r\n“singing geography”, the pupils being ranged round the room to chant\r\ngeographical facts. Whether Maury was thus inducted into the mysteries\r\nof that science which his researches were afterwards so greatly to\r\nenrich is not known, for the only schoolbook that he makes reference\r\nto in his letters is the famous Webster’s “Blueback Speller”, which he\r\nsays was the first book that was ever placed in his hands.\r\n\r\nA better education than that afforded in these country elementary\r\nschools was, however, destined for Maury. When he was in his twelfth\r\nyear, a dangerous fall from a tree so injured his back as to cause his\r\nfather to consider it unwise for the lad to continue to work on the\r\nfarm. He had already shown such aptitude for study that it was decided\r\nto send him to Harpeth Academy, then located about two miles from\r\nFranklin. In this school, Maury had as teachers the Reverend Doctor\r\nBlackburn, afterwards Chaplain to Congress; James Otey, who became the\r\nfirst Bishop of Tennessee; and William C. Hasbrouck, who was afterwards\r\na distinguished lawyer in his native state, New York. The impression\r\nthat Maury made upon these scholarly men was a very favorable and\r\nlasting one, and he retained their warm personal friendship as long as\r\nthey lived.\r\n\r\nIt was with Dr. Blackburn that Maury began the study of Latin grammar,\r\nthrough which he marched with seven league boots in only seven days;\r\nthis, of course, was a record for the school. Though he thus showed a\r\ncapacity for learning languages, both at this time and later in the\r\nnavy while on foreign stations, yet the field of science held the\r\ngreatest attraction for Maury. His ambition to become a mathematician\r\nwas aroused in a curious way. “The first man of science I ever saw in\r\nmy infant days in the West”, he said, “was a shoemaker—old Mr. Neil.\r\nHe was a mathematician; he worked out his problems with his awl on\r\nleather, and would send home his shoes with their soles covered with\r\nlittle x’s and y’s. The example of that man first awakened in my breast\r\nthe young spirit of emulation; for my earliest recollections of the\r\nfeelings of ambition are connected with the aspiration to emulate that\r\nman in mathematics”. The ambition to know and achieve early displayed\r\nitself in Maury, and in later life he pleasantly recalled to mind his\r\n“Tennessee school days when the air was filled with castles”.\r\n\r\nSuch, in brief, was the life of Maury as a lad in his adopted state,—a\r\nstate which he came to love and to which he referred years afterwards,\r\nwhen he had traveled extensively and become a famous man, as “the\r\nloveliest of lands” and “the finest country I have ever seen”. Here he\r\nwas nurtured with the best the frontier life had to offer, and given\r\nindependence of mind, courage, and self-reliance; love of honor and\r\na chivalrous respect for woman; an unassuming modesty which bordered\r\non diffidence and bashfulness; a strongly religious inclination; and\r\na burning desire to know and to achieve. With this equipment he would\r\ndoubtless have made a name for himself if he had remained in Tennessee;\r\nbut Providence directed his steps into a broader field where he was\r\nable to gain for himself much greater distinction,—one that was not\r\nalone national but international in its scope.\r\n\r\nOne of the well marked characteristics of Maury’s maturity was the\r\nbreadth of his intellectual vision. His mind loved to exercise itself\r\nwith large problems, and questions of world-wide interest. This trait\r\nin his character could not have been developed so well perhaps in\r\nany other career as in the one he chose,—service in the navy of the\r\nUnited States. In this connection, it is interesting to note that\r\nMaury’s father wished him to study medicine and promised him financial\r\nassistance in such an undertaking. As a physician, he doubtless would\r\nhave reached great eminence and the science of medicine would almost\r\ncertainly have received contributions from his original mind; but a\r\nmilitary career presented greater attractions for the lad. At one time\r\nhe considered entering West Point as a cadet, but some one returned\r\nfrom there with an unfavorable report and, besides, the bare mention of\r\nsuch a plan put his father in a rage; hence he decided against the army\r\nand instead determined to enter the United States Navy.\r\n\r\nThere were very good reasons for Maury’s wishing to become a naval\r\nofficer. Indeed, all his life he had had a close personal interest\r\nin that branch of the government service. His eldest brother, John\r\nMinor Maury, at the age of thirteen, even before the family had left\r\nVirginia, had become a midshipman. He then had thrilling adventures\r\nin the South Seas, was with David Porter in the _Essex_ during the\r\nbloody battle with the English at Valparaiso, and afterwards fought\r\nwith Macdonough in the Battle of Lake Champlain. All this was enough\r\nto awaken the spirit of adventure and arouse the desire of emulation\r\nin the heart of a younger brother. And though John Maury had the\r\nmisfortune, in 1824, to die of yellow fever on board his ship and be\r\nburied at sea off Norfolk, yet Matthew clung firmly to his decision in\r\nthe face of the opposition of his family, particularly his father, to\r\nthe entrance of a second son into so hazardous a profession.\r\n\r\nMaury secured his midshipman’s warrant with comparative ease, through\r\nGeneral Sam Houston, who was at that time the Representative of that\r\ndistrict in Congress. This appointment was gotten, however, without\r\nhis parents’ knowledge, and when it became known to his father he\r\nexpressed his disapproval of his son’s conduct in very strong terms and\r\ndetermined to leave him to his own resources. But young Maury was very\r\nresourceful and contrived to purchase for seventy-five dollars a gray\r\nmare from his cousin Abram Maury’s overseer, which he was to sell upon\r\nreaching his destination, and then he was to repay the money. Still\r\nhe had practically nothing for traveling expenses, but this obstacle\r\nwas removed by his teacher, Mr. Hasbrouck, who gave him thirty dollars\r\nfor assistance he had rendered in teaching the younger pupils in the\r\nAcademy.\r\n\r\nOn the day of his departure on that Sunday in the spring of 1825,\r\nMaury’s father refused to tell him goodbye and turned his back,—it\r\nis said, not so much in anger as in sorrow at his leaving home. No\r\ndoubt the lad’s heart was saddened by this circumstance as well as by\r\nthe parting from the rest of the family, especially from his favorite\r\nbrother Richard, only two years his senior, who had always been his\r\ninseparable companion. But he put on a brave front, mounted his “snow\r\nwhite steed”, and set forth on the long lonesome ride to Virginia,\r\nwhence he was to make his way to Washington and there embark on his new\r\ncareer.\r\n\r\nThe second or third day from home at an inn in East Tennessee, the\r\nyoung traveler fell in with two merchants, Read and Echols, from\r\nHuntsville, Alabama, on their way to Baltimore to purchase goods,\r\nand in company with these gentlemen he traveled as far as Fincastle,\r\nVirginia. Though he greatly enjoyed their company, he was much\r\nconcerned lest they find out his financial condition, suspect his\r\npoverty, and humiliate him by offering him money. His resources were\r\nindeed sadly depleted on crossing over into Virginia, where his money\r\nhad to be exchanged for coin of that state at a ruinous discount of\r\ntwenty per cent, and when, after a journey of two weeks, he reached the\r\nhome of his Cousin Reuben Maury near Charlottesville, he had but fifty\r\ncents left.\r\n\r\nHere a special entertainment was given in his honor, and Maury had\r\nhis first experience with the society manners of the East which were\r\nsomewhat more refined than those of the Tennessee frontier. When the\r\nnegro servant passed him a saucer of ice-cream and a spoon, he very\r\nmodestly placed only a spoonful in his plate and left the remainder\r\nto be passed to the others, thinking that it was some kind of strange\r\nsauce. From this place he proceeded to the home of his Uncle Edward\r\nHerndon, near Fredericksburg; and while visiting there, he met the\r\nyoung girl who was some years afterwards to become his wife. She was\r\nAnn Hull Herndon, the eldest daughter of Dabney Herndon, who was a\r\nbanker and prominent citizen of Fredericksburg. It was a case of love\r\nat first sight with young Maury, who was completely captivated by the\r\nblue eyes, auburn hair, and musical voice of his fair cousin; while she\r\nin turn was very favorably impressed with this relative from the West\r\nwith his ruddy complexion which she used to say after they were married\r\nreminded her of “David fresh from his sheep with his sling”.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n  _From De Meissner’s “Old Naval Days,” through courtesy of Henry\r\n  Holt and Company._\r\n\r\n  U. S. S. “BRANDYWINE,” COMMANDER BIDDLE, OFF MALTA, NOVEMBER 6,\r\n  1831; AND U. S. S. “CONCORD,” CAPTAIN PERRY, IN BACKGROUND]\r\n\r\nWhen he arrived at his destination in Washington, the Secretary of\r\nthe Navy allowed him fifteen cents a mile as mileage from Franklin,\r\nTennessee, and this fairly put Maury’s head above water financially.\r\nAfter a short visit with relatives here, he went on to New York where\r\nhe had been ordered to report on board the U. S. Frigate _Brandywine_.\r\n\r\nHere he arrived August 13, 1825, and at once entered into active\r\nservice in the profession which he had chosen. He has left no record\r\nas to what his thoughts and feelings were during those weeks when he,\r\na lad from the West who had never seen a ship before, was adjusting\r\nhimself to those new and strange surroundings. But that he had made\r\nup his mind to succeed in his chosen career, whether he liked it or\r\nnot, is evident from this sentiment which occurs more than once in his\r\nletters: “... to the old rule with which I set out on horseback from\r\nTennessee in 1825, a fresh midshipman, ‘Make everything bend to your\r\nprofession’”.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER II\r\n\r\n                           HIS THREE CRUISES\r\n\r\n\r\nMaury’s early years in the navy afforded the lad from the backwoods\r\nof Tennessee wonderful experiences, and excellent opportunities for\r\nsupplementing the desultory education that he had received. To a young\r\nman of his intellectual capacity, these voyages to foreign lands during\r\nthe most plastic years of his life were invaluable in the development\r\nof a mind capable of grappling later with questions and problems which\r\nconcerned the entire world.\r\n\r\nLuckily for the young officer, the very first ship to which he was\r\nattached, the _Brandywine_, was the vessel which had been chosen to\r\nconvey Lafayette home to France after his memorable visit to the United\r\nStates. This ship, named from Brandywine Creek, the scene of the\r\nbattle in which Lafayette was wounded on September 11, 1777, had been\r\nlaunched on June 16 of the year 1825. In equipping her for this special\r\nservice, the officers had been selected so as to represent as many\r\ndifferent states as possible and, where it was practicable, they were\r\nto be descendants of persons who had distinguished themselves in the\r\nRevolution. This accounted for the large number of midshipmen ordered\r\naboard her, twenty-six instead of the usual eight or ten for a vessel\r\nof that size. Maury was thus brought in touch with young officers from\r\nvarious sections of the country; and among the senior officers were\r\nCaptain Charles Morris, who had made a name for himself in the War of\r\n1812, and Lieutenant David Farragut, who was to become one of the very\r\ngreatest American naval leaders.\r\n\r\nOn the 8th of September the _Brandywine_ set sail from the mouth of\r\nthe Potomac, where Lafayette had been received on board the ship.\r\nShe passed down the Chesapeake through a brilliant rainbow which was\r\napparently supported on the Virginia and Maryland shores, as if Nature\r\nhad reserved to herself the honor of erecting the last of the numerous\r\ntriumphal arches that had been dedicated to the great Frenchman during\r\nhis extraordinary visit. As the ship made her way to sea, almost the\r\nlast glimpse which Lafayette had of America was the bluffs of the York\r\nRiver where he had so materially aided the American cause at the Battle\r\nof Yorktown.\r\n\r\nThe voyage turned out to be not a very pleasant one, for the ship had\r\nhardly gotten under way when she began to leak and for a time it was\r\nthought that she would have to return to port. But as it was reported\r\nthat the leak was under control, Lafayette advised the captain to\r\ncontinue the voyage, and when the planks of the vessel swelled from\r\nimmersion in the water the leak gradually diminished. The weather,\r\nhowever, then became stormy, and during most of the passage the\r\ndistinguished passenger suffered so severely from sea-sickness and gout\r\nthat he was unable to join the officers at dinner or to visit the deck.\r\nThey were thus deprived, much to their regret, from listening as much\r\nas they desired to the reminiscences of the great general’s interesting\r\nand eventful life. There was another unpleasantness that affected the\r\nmidshipmen in particular. This was caused by a steward who, in cleaning\r\nan officer’s uniform, upset a bottle of turpentine, the contents of\r\nwhich ran into a barrel of sugar belonging to the midshipmen’s mess.\r\nAs a consequence, during the remainder of the voyage they had to eat\r\ntheir desserts strongly flavored with turpentine.\r\n\r\nAt the close of the voyage, the midshipmen presented to Lafayette, as a\r\nmark of their personal friendship, a beautiful silver urn appropriately\r\nengraved with scenes of the Capitol at Washington, Lafayette’s visit to\r\nthe tomb of Washington, and the arrival of the _Brandywine_ at Havre.\r\nAt this French port, Lafayette disembarked, taking with him the flag\r\nof the American vessel as a souvenir of the voyage. From here Maury’s\r\nship proceeded to Cowes where she was calked, and then sailed for the\r\nMediterranean, joining Commodore John Rodgers’ squadron at Gibraltar on\r\nthe 2nd of November. The ship was refitted here during the winter, and\r\nthe following spring she returned to the United States, arriving at New\r\nYork in May, 1826.\r\n\r\nSuch in brief outline was Maury’s first cruise. Though none of his\r\nletters giving his impressions of these first months at sea have been\r\npreserved, yet it is not difficult to imagine with what eagerness\r\nand delight his active young mind observed the strange sights and\r\nassimilated the new experiences. Many years afterwards he wrote of how\r\nhe secured a Spanish work on navigation in order that he might acquire\r\na new language and a science at the same time. In this connection he\r\nrelated how he resorted to various artifices for study while on watch.\r\n“If I went below only for a moment or two,” he wrote, “and could lay\r\nhands upon a dictionary or any book, I would note a sentence, or\r\neven a word, that I did not understand, and fix it in my memory to\r\nbe reflected upon when I went on deck. I used to draw problems in\r\nspherical trigonometry with chalk on the shot, and put them in the\r\nracks where I could see them as I walked the deck. That with so much\r\nperseverance I should have failed in my prime object, I attribute\r\nto the want of books and proper teachers in the navy”. It was this\r\nseriousness of purpose and industry that caused Maury soon to become\r\nwell known among his shipmates for his scholarship, and the story is\r\ntold that even on this first cruise a certain mathematical problem was\r\npassed from steerage to wardroom without solution until he solved it.\r\n\r\nAfter making a short visit to his home in Tennessee, Maury set sail\r\non June 10, 1826 from Norfolk on the frigate _Macedonian_ to which\r\nhe had been ordered for temporary duty. This ship was bound for Rio\r\nJaneiro where she arrived after a passage of sixty-two days. After\r\ncruising in Brazilian waters for awhile, the frigate went on down the\r\ncoast to Montevideo. At this time a war was raging between Brazil\r\nand Argentina over Banda Oriental, or Uruguay, which had been a sort\r\nof political football between the two countries until 1821, when it\r\nwas partly subdued by Brazil. In 1825, however, it rose against this\r\nempire, and after a long struggle of three years it succeeded in having\r\nits independence recognized by the treaty of Rio Janeiro, on August\r\n27, 1828. This state of affairs constituted the principal reason why\r\nAmerican ships of war were sent to those waters. Thus was Maury brought\r\ninto touch with history in the making, and the letters which he wrote\r\nat this time show an alert interest in what he was observing and\r\ndisplay as well an unusual ability in recording experiences and his\r\nimpressions of the people.\r\n\r\nHis name was still carried on the muster and pay rolls of the\r\n_Brandywine_; but that ship did not depart for South American waters\r\nuntil the last of August, 1826, when she set sail from New York\r\nwith the _Vincennes_. Eventually it was Maury’s good fortune to be\r\ntransferred to the latter vessel, in which he was to circumnavigate the\r\nglobe. He first joined the _Vincennes_, on March 10, 1827, in Callao\r\nRoads, the port of Lima, Peru. The American warships had by this time\r\nentered the Pacific and were cruising up and down the South American\r\ncoast from Valparaiso, Chile to Guayaquil, Ecuador to protect the\r\ncommerce of the United States, as this part of South America also was\r\nthen in turmoil.\r\n\r\nBolivar, after liberating the states of northern South America from\r\nSpanish rule, was endeavoring to organize Columbia, Peru, Bolivia, La\r\nPlata, and Chile into a grand republic, of which he aspired to be the\r\nruler. The union of the first three of these states was practically\r\nrealized, but the undertaking finally ended in failure because of the\r\njealousy of Bolivar’s former companions in arms and the fickleness\r\nof the South American people. This characteristic of the people is\r\nhumorously set forth in Maury’s letters in which he describes some\r\nof the fighting which he witnessed at Guayaquil. The young man’s\r\nhistorical outlook was thus further broadened by this personal contact\r\nwith the affairs of the great _Libertador_, Bolivar.\r\n\r\nOn July 4, 1829, the war meanwhile having come to an end, the\r\n_Vincennes_, under the command of Captain William Compton (Bolton)\r\nFinch, set forth from Callao on her voyage across the Pacific. She\r\nwas to make her first stop at the Washington Islands, now known as\r\nthe Marquesas, in order, as Captain Finch’s orders read, to secure\r\nproper treatment from the natives for any of our defenseless seafaring\r\ncountrymen who in their lawful pursuits were compelled by necessity\r\nto resort to the harbors of the islands for refreshment and supplies;\r\nto reclaim those who from improper motives had remained among the\r\nislanders; and by exhibiting the moral advancement of America to so\r\nraise the American national character in their estimation as to induce\r\na praiseworthy imitation of it on their part. The ship arrived at one\r\nof the islands, Nukahiva by name, on July 26, and in order to carry out\r\nthe spirit of his orders Captain Finch made his vessel a “tabu ship”\r\nthat he might prevent the gross licentiousness to which ships from\r\nChristian lands were usually surrendered in those ports.\r\n\r\nFor an account of Maury’s experiences on this cruise little is to\r\nbe derived from his extant letters, but fortunately Chaplain C. S.\r\nStewart wrote a book entitled “A Visit to the South Seas in the U. S.\r\nShip Vincennes during the years 1829 and 1830”, in which he mentions\r\nMaury as a member of the shore party which visited the Valley of Taioa\r\nand as one of those who went on various other expeditions on the\r\nisland of Nukahiva under the direction of the chaplain. That these\r\nwere unforgettable experiences is evident from Stewart’s rapturous\r\ndescriptions of the people and the scenery of the island which, he\r\ndeclared, “seemed almost a fairy land, scarce less fascinating in its\r\nfeatures than the imaginary haunts pictured by the pens of genius as\r\nthe abode of Calypso, or the happy valley of the Abyssinian prince”.\r\n\r\nBefore leaving this island Maury had an experience of peculiar\r\ninterest. It was here that his brother John had spent two years\r\npractically cut off from civilization. Just before the War of 1812,\r\nhe had secured a furlough from the navy and had gone as first officer\r\nin a merchantman on a voyage to China. On departing from Nukahiva,\r\nthe captain of this ship left John Maury and six men on the island\r\nto procure sandalwood and other articles of commerce. They were, of\r\ncourse, to be taken off on the return from China; but the war broke out\r\nand the ship was blockaded in a Chinese port by the English. Meanwhile\r\nthe Americans were left to shift for themselves on Nukahiva, and in\r\na war between two tribes, one of which was friendly to them, all the\r\nwhite men were killed except John Maury and another man named Baker.\r\nFortunately, Porter visited the island during the famous cruise of\r\nthe _Essex_, and rescued the two survivors. In order that he might\r\nlearn something about the history of his brother while on the island,\r\nMidshipman Maury set about studying the language of the natives, during\r\nthe three weeks or so of his visit. And shortly before his departure\r\nhe was able to converse with the old chief who had been his brother’s\r\nfriend. “The Happas and the Typees”, Maury wrote, “were at war. The\r\nlatter having just captured three children from the former, we went\r\nto the rescue and recovered two, the third had been eaten. When we\r\nreturned to the Happa Valley from the expedition—it was the valley\r\nwhere dwelt my brother—the men had liberty and the old Happa chief\r\nremained on board as a hostage, for his subjects were all a set of\r\nsavages and the women literally in the fig leaf state. At night when\r\nall the men had come off safe and sound, and a few days only before we\r\nleft, I was sent to take the old fellow ashore. Going ashore, I made\r\nmyself known to him. He was the firm and fast friend of my brother. Had\r\nsaved his life. He was then old. He it was that offered me his scepter,\r\nhis own wife, and the daughter of a neighboring chief if I would\r\nremain”.\r\n\r\nNeedless to say, this flattering offer was rejected, and Maury was\r\non the _Vincennes_ when she sailed away from the island. In leaving\r\nthe bay, the ship narrowly escaped destruction, for the vessel was\r\nat first becalmed and then suddenly carried by the swell toward the\r\nbreakers. Every face was pale with fear and the silence of the grave\r\nhung over the ship, but a timely breath of air filled the topsails and\r\nfinally slowly carried her out to the open sea. In five days she was\r\nseven hundred miles away at Tahiti, one of the Society Islands. Here\r\nMaury had the pleasure of joining several shore parties, and was also\r\npresent at an interesting reception to the Queen of Tahiti on board the\r\n_Vincennes_, when the firing of the salute to the queen greatly alarmed\r\nher and caused her to behave in a very humorous and undignified manner.\r\n\r\nThe ship then set sail, after a month’s visit, for the Sandwich\r\nIslands. On the island of Hawaii Maury visited the Cascade of the\r\nRainbow and probably saw also the volcano of Kilauea, about both of\r\nwhich Chaplain Stewart goes into rhapsodies in his account of the\r\nvoyage. Captain Finch went also to Honolulu, on the island of Oahu,\r\nand there presented to King Kamehameha III a pair of gloves and a\r\nlarge map of the United States, and a silver vase to the regent and\r\ntwo silver goblets to the princess. A letter from the Secretary of the\r\nNavy was then delivered to the king. This was well received by his\r\nmajesty, and his reply was in the friendliest possible tone, agreeing\r\nto treat American sailors with more consideration and fairness in the\r\nfuture. The purpose of the visit having thus been accomplished, several\r\ndeserters having been reclaimed, and the settlement of claims for about\r\n$50,000 for American citizens having been negotiated, the ship departed\r\nfor China.\r\n\r\nLeaving behind the northern Bashee Islands, which are considered one\r\nof the barriers of the Pacific as well as one of the portals to the\r\nCelestial Empire, the ship came to anchor on January 3, 1830 in the\r\nroads of Macao, a Portuguese city, situated on a small island about\r\nseventy miles from Canton. The _Vincennes_ thus gained the distinction\r\nof being the second American man-of-war to visit Chinese waters,\r\nhaving been preceded only by the _Congress_ in 1819. After receiving\r\na statement from the American consul and merchants at Canton on the\r\nadvisability of having American men-of-war make periodic visits\r\nto Chinese waters, Captain Finch was off again, this time for the\r\nPhilippines.\r\n\r\nAfter a brief visit at Manila, the ship turned towards home, and,\r\nstopping in the Straits of Sunda and at Cape Town, on the first of May\r\ncame in sight of the Island of St. Helena. Here ample time was afforded\r\nthe officers for seeing Longwood House in which Napoleon had lived and\r\nalso his tomb, from which the body of the great general had not at that\r\ntime been removed to Paris. After leaving this island, the ship made no\r\nother stop until she arrived in New York on the 8th of June, 1830, with\r\nher band appropriately playing, “Hail Columbia! Happy Land!”\r\n\r\nAfter almost four years to a day, Maury was home again; but he was no\r\nlonger the raw lad from the Tennessee backwoods, for the information\r\nand experience which he had gained on this cruise of the first American\r\nman-of-war to circumnavigate the globe had gone a long way towards\r\ntaking the place of a college education. Men of the stamp of Commodore\r\nCharles Morris, Lieutenant Farragut, Captain Finch, Chaplain Stewart,\r\nand dozens of other officers with whom he had come in contact during\r\nhis first two cruises had contributed, by example at least, in making\r\nhim into an officer and a gentleman. During all this time he had\r\nstudied, and read as widely as opportunity afforded, having had the\r\nprivilege for a portion of the time of using the books of Midshipman\r\nWilliam Irving, a nephew to Washington Irving.\r\n\r\nThat the opportunities for instruction on shipboard were, however, very\r\nlimited is indicated by the following summary of Maury’s experience\r\nwith the school system of the navy. “The first ship I sailed in”,\r\nhe wrote, “had a schoolmaster: a young man from Connecticut. He was\r\nwell qualified and well disposed to teach navigation, but not having\r\na schoolroom, or authority to assemble the midshipmen, the cruise\r\npassed off without the opportunity of organizing his school. From him,\r\ntherefore, we learned nothing. On my next cruise, the dominie was a\r\nSpaniard; and, being bound to South America, there was a perfect mania\r\nin the steerage for the Spanish language. In our youthful impetuosity\r\nwe bought books, and for a week or so pursued the study with great\r\neagerness. But our spirits began to flag, and the difficulties of\r\n_ser_ and _estar_ finally laid the copestone for us over the dominie’s\r\nvernacular. The study was exceedingly dry. We therefore voted both\r\nteacher and grammar a bore, and committing the latter to the deep, with\r\none accord, we declared in favor of the Byronical method—\r\n\r\n    ‘’Tis pleasant to be taught in a strange tongue\r\n      By female lips and eyes’;\r\n\r\nand continued to defer our studies till we should arrive in the South\r\nAmerican vale of paradise, called Valparaiso. After arriving on that\r\nstation, the commander, who had often expressed his wish that we\r\nshould learn to speak Spanish, sent down ‘for all the young gentlemen’,\r\nas the middies are called, and commenced to ask us one by one—‘Can\r\nyou speak Spanish?’ ‘No, sir.’ ‘Then you are no gentleman’. ‘Can you?’\r\nBut always receiving the same answer, he sent us out of the cabin as\r\na set of blackguards. As he was as ignorant on this subject as any\r\nof us, we included him among the number, and thought it an excellent\r\njoke. Thus ended our scholastic duties on that ship. I was afterwards\r\ntransferred to another vessel in which the schoolmaster was a young\r\nlawyer, who knew more about _jetsam_ and _flotsam_ than about lunars\r\nand dead reckoning—at least, I presume so, for he never afforded\r\nus an opportunity to judge of his knowledge on the latter subjects.\r\nHe was not on speaking terms with the reefers, ate up all the plums\r\nfor the duff, and was finally turned out of the ship as a nuisance.\r\nWhen I went to sea again, the teacher was an amiable and accomplished\r\nyoung man, from the ‘land of schoolmasters and leather pumpkin seed’.\r\nPoor fellow!—far gone in consumption, had a field of usefulness been\r\nopen to him, he could not have labored in it. He went to sea for his\r\nhealth, but never returned. There was no schoolmaster in the next ship,\r\nand the ‘young gentlemen’ were as expert at lunars, and as _au fait_\r\nin the mysteries of latitude and departure, as any I had seen. In my\r\nnext ship, the dominie was a young man, troubled like some of your\r\ncorrespondents, Mr. Editor, with _cacoethes scribendi_. He wrote a\r\nbook. But I never saw him teaching ‘the young idea’, or instructing the\r\nyoung gentlemen in the art of plain sailing; nor did I think it was his\r\nfault, for he had neither schoolroom nor pupil. Such is my experience\r\nof the school system in the navy; and I believe that of every officer\r\nwill tally with it”.[1]\r\n\r\nMaury had the privilege of continuing his studies ashore in New York\r\nand Washington for several months before he embarked on his next\r\ncruise. He was then preparing himself for the examination for the\r\nrank of passed midshipman. This examination covered the following\r\nsubjects: Bowditch’s “Navigation”; Playfair’s “Euclid”, Books 1, 2, 3,\r\n4, and 6; McClure’s “Spherics”; Spanish or French; Mental and Moral\r\nPhilosophy; Bourdon’s “Algebra”; and Seamanship. The time devoted to\r\neach midshipman by the examiners, in the order of his appointment,\r\nranged from fifty minutes to two hours. To judge from the questions in\r\nseamanship, the examination was largely of a very practical nature,—on\r\nhow to handle the sails of a ship and how to navigate her.\r\n\r\nIn his examination, Maury passed twenty-seven in a class of forty.\r\nAn explanation of this apparently low standing may be gathered from\r\nthe following account of the manner of conducting such examinations:\r\n“The midshipman who seeks to become learned in the branches of science\r\nthat pertain to his profession, and who before the Examining Board\r\nshould so far stray from the lids of Bowditch as to get among the\r\nisodynamic and other lines of a magnetic chart, would be blackballed\r\nas certainly as though he were to clubhaul a ship for the Board in the\r\nHebrew tongue.... Midshipmen, turning to Bowditch, commit to memory the\r\nformula of his first or second method for ‘finding the longitude at sea\r\nby a lunar observation’. Thus crammed or ‘drilled’, as it is called,\r\nthey go before the Board of Examination, where, strange to say, there\r\nis a premium offered for such qualification. He who repeats ‘by heart’\r\nthe rules of Bowditch, though he does not understand the mathematical\r\nprinciples involved in one of them, obtains a higher number from the\r\nBoard than he who, skilled in mathematics, goes to the blackboard and,\r\ndrawing his diagram, can demonstrate every problem in navigation”.[2]\r\nMaury, no doubt, wrote this out of his own personal experience; and\r\neven though the results of his examination may have indicated that in\r\nthe ordinary duties of his profession he was not above the average,\r\nstill it was to be in a special field of the service that his genius\r\nwas to display itself.\r\n\r\nDuring the winter which Maury spent in Washington he fell completely\r\nin love with his cousin, Ann Herndon, who was visiting relatives in\r\nGeorgetown. Hitherto there had been a certain safety in numbers, as\r\nindicated by the numerous references in his letters to the charms\r\nof English girls and the “piercing eyes and insinuating smiles” of\r\nthe Brazilian and Peruvian maidens. But before he went to sea again\r\nhe became engaged to his cousin, and on his departure he gave her a\r\nlittle seal which was to be used only when she wrote to him; it bore\r\nthe inscription of the single word _Mizpah_, that beautiful Biblical\r\nparting salutation, “The Lord watch between thee and me when we are\r\nabsent one from the other”.\r\n\r\nThis love affair caused Maury to consider resigning from the naval\r\nservice, but his hope of getting employment as a surveyor did not\r\nmaterialize and he finally concluded that he supposed Uncle Sam would\r\nhave the selling of his bones to the doctors. Accordingly, in June,\r\n1831 he sailed again for the Pacific, this time in the _Falmouth_. His\r\nship touched at Rio for a brief visit, then doubled Cape Horn, and\r\narrived at Valparaiso the last of October. The _Falmouth_ remained\r\non this station for about a year, and Maury renewed his former\r\nacquaintances and enjoyed the hospitality of Chilean society at dances\r\nand dinners without number. The vessel then cruised further north along\r\nthe coast, visiting various ports and remaining several months at\r\nCallao.\r\n\r\nOne of Maury’s shipmates on this cruise has left some reminiscences\r\nwhich throw considerable light upon his young friend’s qualities as an\r\nofficer. “I encountered some ridicule”, wrote Captain Whiting, “from\r\nmy messmates for predicting that Maury would be a distinguished man. I\r\nasserted that there was that in him which could not be kept down.... In\r\na survey of San Lorenzo Island while attached to the _Falmouth_ I was\r\nan assistant to Maury, and he displayed that perseverance and energy\r\nundismayed by difficulty when he had once determined upon accomplishing\r\na result, which ever marked his career. In prosecuting the survey of\r\nthe Boca del Diables he scaled rocks and crept around the corners of\r\ncliffs when I was almost afraid to follow him, but the attainment of\r\nhis object seemed to be with him the only subject of his thoughts.\r\nHe landed on the Labos Rocks to the westward of San Lorenzo to make\r\nsome astronomical and trigonometrical observations while I remained\r\nin the boat. When he landed it was almost a dead calm, and the sea\r\ncomparatively smooth; but by the time he had finished his observations\r\na fresh wind had sprung up from the southwards, the tide had risen,\r\nand the sea was raging so as to forbid the near approach of the boat,\r\none minute receding from the rock so as to leave a yawning gulf of\r\ntwenty or thirty feet depth, then rushing up again with appalling and\r\nirresistible force. Calling on me to approach as near as I dared,\r\nMaury ascended to the highest point of the rock, took off his jacket,\r\nand with a string which he found in his pocket tied in it his watch and\r\nsextant, and then threw it with all his might into the sea toward the\r\nboat, while the bowman of the boat stood ready to seize it with his\r\nboathook before the water had time to penetrate the wrapping. Maury\r\nthen, watching the culmination of a wave, sprang from the rock himself\r\nand being a good swimmer and possessed of much youthful strength\r\nreached the boat in safety, but it was a fearful leap”.\r\n\r\nThe seeds of Maury’s later wonderful achievements in the science of\r\nthe sea were implanted during this cruise of the _Falmouth_. He was\r\nthe sailing master of the ship, and naturally wished to make as quick\r\na voyage as possible. Before sailing he had searched diligently for\r\ninformation concerning the winds and currents and the best course for\r\nhis ship to take, and was astonished to find that there was practically\r\nno information on the subject to be secured. The observations of these\r\nphenomena of the sea which he accordingly made on this voyage turned\r\nhis mind toward a series of investigations which later was to make his\r\nname known round the entire world.\r\n\r\nMaury did not return to the United States in the _Falmouth_, but\r\nshortly before her departure from Callao he was transferred on August\r\n20, 1833 to the schooner _Dolphin_, in which vessel he performed the\r\nduties of first lieutenant. He remained on the little schooner but a\r\nfew weeks, and then was attached to the frigate _Potomac_, which had\r\njust arrived at Callao under the command of Captain John Downes. This\r\nship had been on duty on the Pacific coast of South America for a\r\nlittle more than a year, after having cruised almost around the world\r\nby way of the Cape of Good Hope, the Malay Archipelago, China, and the\r\nSouth Seas.\r\n\r\nIn a short time, however, the _Potomac_ sailed for home, arriving at\r\nValparaiso the middle of December. Here, according to Captain Whiting,\r\nMaury had a very unpleasant experience with a young lady named Manuela\r\nPoma with whom he had previously become acquainted. Her hand had been\r\nsought by a young officer of the Chilean army, who the evening before\r\nthe _Potomac_ sailed came on board the ship and told Maury that he had\r\ndestroyed all his hopes of happiness. He said that the previous day he\r\nhad made a declaration of his love to Manuela and that she had rejected\r\nhim, telling him that her affections were already bestowed on the young\r\nAmerican naval officer. Instead of priding himself on this conquest,\r\nas many young men would have done, Maury was exceedingly distressed as\r\nhe had considered his relationship with the young girl to have been\r\nnothing more than that of friendship, and by a returning ship he sent\r\na long letter to Manuela. Soon after his arrival in Boston he learned\r\nthat she had died of consumption.\r\n\r\nThe voyage home round the Horn and by way of Rio was more or less\r\nuneventful, except for imminent peril for a time from icebergs off\r\nthe Falkland Islands. After three years Maury was home again, and\r\naccording to the decrees of Fate this was to be his last cruise. Hence\r\na distinctive period in his life had come to a close; but his nine\r\nyears of almost continuous sea duty had been a splendid preparation for\r\nthe peculiar scientific work that he was soon to undertake.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER III\r\n\r\n                         HE RESORTS TO THE PEN\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the _Potomac_ arrived in Boston, Maury applied for leave of\r\nabsence and went directly to Fredericksburg, Virginia, where he was\r\nmarried to Ann Herndon on July 15, 1834. In this charming old Virginia\r\ntown he established his residence for the next seven years, living on\r\nCharlotte Street in a two-story frame house with a large old-fashioned\r\ngarden, which he rented from a Mr. Johnston. He had always been\r\ngenerous with his money to different members of his family, and it is\r\nrelated that, as a consequence, he had but twenty dollars of ready\r\nmoney at the time of his marriage, all of which he gave as a fee to\r\nParson E. C. McGuire. In the same generous way he shared his home for a\r\nconsiderable time with his brother John’s widow and her two sons.\r\n\r\nWith some leisure at his command, Maury determined to become an author,\r\nunder the encouragement of the recent appearance in the _American\r\nJournal of Science and Arts_ of his first scientific article, “On the\r\nNavigation of Cape Horn”. This, the first fruit of his sea experience,\r\ndescribed forcefully the dangers of the passage of Cape Horn, and gave\r\nspecific information concerning the winds and the peculiar rising and\r\nfalling of the barometer in those latitudes. In the same number of\r\nthis journal there appeared another article describing Maury’s “Plan\r\nof an Instrument for Finding the True Lunar Distance”, the instrument\r\nin question having been invented by him. With these beginnings, he\r\nambitiously set to work to finish a book on navigation, which he had\r\ncommenced during the last part of his recent tour of sea duty. He did\r\nnot expect to receive much direct profit from such a nautical book,\r\nbut hoped that it might be of a collateral advantage to him in making\r\nhis name known to the Navy Department and to his brother officers. As\r\nit was the first nautical work of science ever to come from the pen of\r\nan American naval officer, he expected to base a claim for promotion\r\non the merits of the book, and had hopes of being made a lieutenant of\r\nten years’ rank with the accompanying back pay amounting to $4,000 or\r\n$5,000.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n  _Courtesy of “The Journal of American History,” Vol. IV, Number 3\r\n  (1910)._\r\n\r\n  LIEUT. M. F. MAURY\r\n  From a daguerreotype of about the year 1855]\r\n\r\nThese plans of Maury’s did not fully materialize. President Jackson\r\nwas of the opinion that the young author deserved promotion for his\r\nscientific work and reimbursement for the money which he had expended\r\nin its publication, but the Secretary of the Navy, Mahlon Dickerson,\r\ndid not carry out the President’s wishes. The book itself, however,\r\nwas a great success on its appearance early in the year 1836, under\r\nthe title of “A New Theoretical and Practical Treatise on Navigation”.\r\nThe publishers, E. C. and J. Biddle of Philadelphia, soon had the\r\npleasure of printing a long list of favorable opinions of the work\r\nfrom professors and distinguished officers in the navy, among which\r\nthe commendation of Nathaniel Bowditch gave Maury the greatest\r\nsatisfaction. His book very quickly took the place of Bowditch’s\r\n“Practical Navigator” as a textbook for junior officers in the navy,\r\nand when the Naval Academy was established at Annapolis it was used\r\nfor several years as the basis of the instruction given to midshipmen\r\nin navigation. In the title page appeared the significant words, “Cur\r\nNon?” (Why not?), the motto adopted by Lafayette when he espoused the\r\ncause of the American colonies; this was in effect Maury’s answer to\r\nany query that might be made as to why a young naval officer should\r\nattempt the writing of a book.\r\n\r\nOf the reviews of Maury’s work, one of the most interesting appeared\r\nin the _Southern Literary Messenger_ of June, 1836. It was written by\r\nEdgar Allan Poe, who was then editor of that magazine, and closed with\r\nthe following paragraph: “The spirit of literary improvement has been\r\nawakened among the officers of our gallant navy. We are pleased to see\r\nthat science also is gaining votaries from its ranks. Hitherto how\r\nlittle have they improved the golden opportunities of knowledge which\r\ntheir distant voyages held forth, and how little have they enjoyed the\r\nrich banquet which nature spreads for them in every clime they visit!\r\nBut the time is coming when, imbued with a taste for science and a\r\nspirit of research, they will become ardent explorers of the regions in\r\nwhich they sojourn. Freighted with the knowledge which observation only\r\ncan impart, and enriched with collections of objects precious to the\r\nstudent of nature, their return after the perils of a distant voyage\r\nwill then be doubly joyful. The enthusiast in science will anxiously\r\nawait their coming, and add his cordial welcome to the warm greetings\r\nof relatives and friends”. Poe, perhaps, had no idea how soon his\r\nprophetic words were to be fulfilled,—and by the very man whose book\r\nhe had so favorably reviewed.\r\n\r\nAfter making this successful entry into the field of authorship, Maury\r\nlectured on scientific subjects in Fredericksburg and set about the\r\nstudying of mineralogy, geology, and drawing. In these studies he\r\nmade such progress as to qualify himself to become superintendent of\r\nthe United States Gold Mine near Fredericksburg. He spent the summer\r\nof 1836 with his family at this mine where he made some important\r\nimprovements in its administration. Meanwhile, he had been promoted on\r\nJune 10, 1836 to the rank of lieutenant, and though he had been offered\r\na salary of $1200 as a mining engineer he decided to remain in the navy.\r\n\r\nMaury’s interests were next directed to the Exploring Expedition to the\r\nSouth Seas. The little squadron selected to make the cruise, composed\r\nof the frigate _Macedonian_ and the brigs _Pioneer_ and _Consort_,\r\nrendezvoused at Norfolk in the autumn of the year 1836, under the\r\ncommand of Captain Thomas Ap Catesby Jones. Maury made an attempt to\r\nsecure the command of one of the smaller vessels; but he failed in\r\nthis, and had to be content with being attached to the _Macedonian_,\r\nMarch 18, 1837. Secretary of the Navy Dickerson had not, from its\r\ninception, been in favor of the expedition, which he looked upon as\r\na scheme by President Jackson for self-glorification. He therefore\r\ndid all that he could to block the sailing of the squadron by causing\r\nunnecessary delays, not caring for the waste of money involved in this\r\nprocrastination. In this way the ships were kept at Norfolk until\r\nOctober when they finally sailed for New York.\r\n\r\nIn September, Maury had had the good fortune to be appointed\r\n“Astronomer” for the expedition with $1000 additional pay, and also as\r\nassistant to the “Hydrographer”, Lieutenant James Glynn. To prepare\r\nhimself for these duties he went to Philadelphia, where in a little\r\nobservatory in Rittenhouse Square he soon familiarized himself with\r\nthe use of astronomical instruments. The expedition, however, still\r\ndelayed to set sail, and the vexatious interference with his command\r\nso affected Captain Jones’s health as to give the Secretary of the\r\nNavy an excuse for removing him from his position. Matters had by this\r\ntime come to such a pass that several officers declined the command\r\nwhen it was offered them; namely, Captains Shubrick, Kearny, Perry, and\r\nGregory. Finally, in April, 1838, a junior officer, Lieutenant Charles\r\nWilkes, though there were eighty lieutenants above his grade, was\r\nselected, and he accepted the appointment.\r\n\r\nThe sloops of war _Vincennes_ and _Peacock_ and two smaller vessels\r\nwere chosen instead of those originally prepared, and it became\r\nnecessary to reorganize the personnel of the expedition. Maury had\r\nsympathized with Captain Jones in the unjust treatment which he had\r\nreceived from the Secretary of the Navy, and besides he had written\r\nthat Wilkes was the only officer in the navy with whom he would not\r\ncoöperate provided that he was put in command of the enterprise. He\r\ntherefore asked to be detached from the expedition.\r\n\r\nMaury might possibly have had the honor of commanding the exploring\r\nexpedition himself, as clearly indicated by the following letter which\r\nhe wrote years afterwards: “The expedition had been taken away from the\r\nSecretary of the Navy and transferred to Poinsett, Secretary of War. I\r\nwas ordered to fetch the instruments to Washington and report myself to\r\nPoinsett. He received me with open arms, took me into his bosom, and\r\nasked me to give him the names of the officers _without regard to rank_\r\nthat _I_ thought best qualified for the expedition. I afterwards had\r\nreason to suppose that he expected me to name myself and intended to\r\nput me in command of it, as really I was the most important personage\r\nin it—Hydrographer and Astronomer. But I asked myself, what right\r\nhave I to draw distinctions among brother officers? So I gave him a\r\nlist of the officers belonging to the expedition; myself, the youngest\r\nlieutenant in the navy, at the bottom of the list. He froze up with\r\ndisgust, ordered Wilkes home, and gave him the command, and so I was\r\nthe gainer, for I preserved mine integrity”.\r\n\r\nMaury was next assigned to the duty of surveying Southern harbors,\r\nrelative to the establishment of a navy yard in the South. In this\r\nwork he assisted Lieutenant James Glynn, in the schooner _Experiment_\r\nand the steamboat _Engineer_, in the examination and survey of the\r\nharbors of Beaufort and Wilmington, and the inlets Sapelo and Doboy on\r\nthe coast of Georgia. Early in the month of August, 1839, Maury was\r\ndetached from the _Engineer_ at Norfolk with leave for one month, and\r\nhe set out very soon thereafter from his home in Fredericksburg to\r\nvisit his parents in Tennessee to look after some business affairs for\r\nhis father who had become old and infirm, and also to make arrangements\r\nfor conveying them to Virginia where they were to make their home with\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nMaury had written in vain, in February and again in August, 1839, to\r\nF. R. Hassler of the United States Coast Survey offering his services\r\nas head of a triangulation party. This was one of the several attempts\r\nhe made at different times to find work of such a nature as to justify\r\nhis resignation from the navy. By such small threads often hangs a\r\nman’s destiny. If Hassler had accepted Maury’s services, his whole\r\nfuture would probably have been different from what it became, for an\r\nevent was soon to happen to him which, though apparently at first most\r\nunfortunate, was indirectly to place him on that flood tide which led\r\nhim on to fortune.\r\n\r\nUnder orders to join the brig _Consort_ at New York and continue\r\nthe surveying of Southern harbors, Maury left his father’s home in\r\nTennessee by stage coach to join his ship. He went by the northern\r\nroute, and near Somerset, Ohio, on a rainy night about one o’clock in\r\nthe morning, an embankment gave way and the coach was upset. Maury,\r\nhaving given his seat inside to a woman with a baby in arms, was riding\r\non the seat with the coachman, and was the only person seriously\r\ninjured. There were twelve other passengers; Maury, the thirteenth,\r\nhad his right knee-joint transversely dislocated and the thigh-bone\r\nlongitudinally fractured.\r\n\r\nHis recovery from the injury was slow and painful. The leg was\r\nimproperly set, and at a time when the use of anesthetics was unknown\r\nit had to be reset with great pain to the unfortunate officer. During\r\nthe three months of his confinement at the Hotel Phoenix in Somerset\r\nhe managed to keep up his spirits in spite of the suffering and\r\nloneliness, and to break the tedium of the dull days he commenced the\r\nstudy of French without the aid of either grammar or dictionary. At\r\nlast, in January, 1840, he thought himself strong enough to proceed to\r\nNew York; but it was in the midst of winter and he had to be driven in\r\na sleigh over the Alleghany Mountains. This occasioned considerable\r\ndelay, and when he at length arrived at his destination he found that\r\nhis ship had already sailed. He then made his way to his home in\r\nVirginia to recuperate his health and strength under the apprehension\r\nthat his injury might be so serious as to incapacitate him for further\r\nactive service in the navy.\r\n\r\nDuring the long weeks in Ohio he had been greatly troubled with these\r\nfears and had considered gravely what he might do in the future. He\r\nhad begun then to think seriously of resorting to the pen, and after\r\nhis return home this notion “to take to books and be learned” began to\r\ntake more definite shape in his mind, though he was greatly discouraged\r\nat his ignorance and confused by the wilderness of subjects from which\r\nto choose. He did not, however, wish to give the impression that he\r\nwas shirking active service; so he made application on March 14, 1840\r\nto Secretary of the Navy Paulding for any duty which he could perform\r\nin his present condition, “service on crutches” as he expressed it.\r\nThis, of course, was not granted him, and thus relieved temporarily\r\nfrom active service, he began the writing of his “Scraps from the Lucky\r\nBag”, a series of magazine articles which were soon to make his name\r\nvery widely known.\r\n\r\nIn the summer of 1838, Maury had written five articles for the Richmond\r\n_Whig and Public Advertiser_ under the _nom de plume_ of “Harry Bluff,\r\nU.S. Navy”. His feelings were at that time raw over the outcome of the\r\nExploring Expedition, and in these fearless, straightforward articles\r\nhe bitterly criticised the former Secretary of the Navy Dickerson for\r\nhis inefficiency and called upon his successor, Secretary Paulding, to\r\nrestore to the navy its former prestige. The appointment of Wilkes to\r\ncommand the expedition was handled without gloves. “There was”, wrote\r\nMaury, “a cunning little Jacob who had campaigned in Washington a full\r\nterm of seven years. More prodigal than Laban, you (Secretary of War,\r\nJoel R. Poinsett) gave him, for a single term, both the Rachel and the\r\nLeah of his heart. A junior lieutenant with scarcely enough service at\r\nsea to make him familiar with the common routine of duty on board a\r\nman-of-war, and with one or two short interruptions, a sinecurist on\r\nshore for the last fifteen years, he was lifted over the heads of many\r\nlaborious and meritorious officers, and placed by you in the command of\r\nthe Exploring Expedition in violation of law”.\r\n\r\nMaury wrote, in December of the same year, seven more articles for\r\nthis newspaper, hiding his identity by inscribing them “From Will\r\nWatch to his old messmate Harry Bluff”. In these he went further still\r\ninto details as to the inefficiency of the administration of the navy,\r\ndealing especially with the waste connected with the building and\r\nrepairing of ships, the need for a system of rules and regulations\r\nin the navy, and the advisability of establishing a naval school. As\r\nto the latter, he wrote, “There is not, in America, a naval school\r\nthat deserves the name, or that pretends to teach more than the mere\r\nrudiments of navigation.... Why are not steps taken to have our\r\nofficers educated and fitted for this high responsibility? The idea of\r\na naval academy has been ridiculed. This may be the fault of Congress;\r\nI will not lay the censure at the wrong door—but the Department has\r\nbeen equally inattentive to providing the young officers with the\r\nproper means of learning even practical seamanship”.\r\n\r\nThese “Harry Bluff” and “Will Watch” articles, together with one other\r\non “Navy Matters” by “Brandywine” which also appeared in the _Whig_ at\r\nthis time and reveals Maury’s authorship through its style, contained\r\nthe germs of the ideas which he more fully developed in his “Scraps\r\nfrom the Lucky Bag”. This series of articles on the need of reform\r\nin the conduct of naval affairs appeared in the _Southern Literary\r\nMessenger_ during the years 1840 and 1841, under Maury’s former\r\npseudonym of “Harry Bluff”. The navy was then in a condition of dry\r\nrot, and the time was ripe for some courageous person to awaken the\r\ncountry to a realization of the true state of affairs and to point out\r\nthe reforms that were needed. Maury’s former experience in the naval\r\nservice and his present enforced leisure led him to take up the task,\r\nwhich he performed with a brilliancy and a degree of success that was\r\nfar beyond even his own expectation and gave him a national reputation.\r\n\r\nHis choice of the _Messenger_ as the medium for conveying to the public\r\nhis ideas on maritime subjects had been made the previous year when\r\nthere was published in it an unsigned article, entitled “A Scheme for\r\nRebuilding Southern Commerce: Direct Trade with the South”. In this he\r\nfirst emphasized the importance of the Great Circle route for steamers\r\nbetween English and American ports and pointed out how the _Great\r\nWestern_ on her first voyage might have saved 260 miles by using such a\r\nroute and thus have cut down the time of her passage by about one whole\r\nday. Maury claimed afterwards that after the appearance of his article\r\na work on navigation was published in England and that one of its chief\r\nrecommendations was its chapter on “great circle sailing”. Its author\r\nwas rewarded with a prize from the Royal Geographical Society, and\r\nthe work itself was extensively patronized by the Board of Admiralty,\r\na copy of which they ordered to be supplied to each of the British\r\nmen-of-war in commission.\r\n\r\nThe significance of the title, “Scraps from the Lucky Bag”, is\r\nindicated by the following introductory parody, which enumerates the\r\ncontents of a lucky bag on shipboard:\r\n\r\n    “Shoe of middy and waister’s sock,\r\n     Wing of soldier and idler’s frock,\r\n     Purser’s slops and topman’s hat,\r\n     Boatswain’s call and colt and cat,\r\n     Belt that on the berth-deck lay,\r\n     In the Lucky Bag find their way;\r\n     Gaiter, stock, and red pompoon,\r\n     Sailor’s pan, his pot and spoon,\r\n     Shirt of cook and trowser’s duck,\r\n     Kid and can and ‘doctor’s truck’,\r\n     And all that’s lost and found on board\r\n     In the Lucky Bag’s always stored.”\r\n\r\nIt was a well-chosen and apt title, which enabled Maury to treat in\r\nthe same article of various matters more or less unrelated. Among the\r\nvarious topics that he touched upon was, first, the desirability of\r\nhaving grades in the navy higher than those of captain, to correspond\r\nwith those in foreign navies. He also declared that there should be\r\na larger force on the coast of Africa to put down the traffic in\r\nslaves, and more warships in the Pacific to support American commerce\r\nwith China and to protect American fishermen on the whaling grounds.\r\nThus prophetically did he portray the future of American trade on\r\nthat ocean: “If you have a map of the world at hand, turn to it and,\r\nplacing your finger at the mouth of the Columbia River, consider its\r\ngeographical position and the commercial advantages which, at some day\r\nnot far distant, that point will possess. To the south, in one unbroken\r\nline, lie several thousand miles of coast indented with rich markets\r\nof Spanish America—to the west, Asiatic Russia and China are close at\r\nhand—between the south and west are New Holland and Polynesia; and\r\nwithin good marketable distance are all the groups and clusters of\r\nislands that stud the ocean, from Cape Horn to the Cape of Good Hope,\r\nfrom Asia to America. Picture to yourself civilization striding the\r\nRocky Mountains, and smiling down upon the vast and fruitful regions\r\nbeyond, and calculate, if you can, the important and future greatness\r\nof that point to a commercial and enterprising people. Yet the first\r\nline in the hydrography of such a point remains to be run. It has been\r\nmore than twenty years since an American man-of-war so much as looked\r\ninto the mouth of the Columbia River. Upon what more important service\r\ncould a small force be dispatched than to survey and bring home correct\r\ncharts of that river and its vicinity?”\r\n\r\nHe then pointed out the unpreparedness of the country for war, and\r\ndwelt upon how the United States was forced weakly to acquiesce in the\r\nblockading of Mexico and the La Plata by France, and make no protest at\r\nthe strengthening of her forts on the Great Lakes by England who was\r\nthus violating her treaty with this government. The navy should, he\r\ndeclared, experiment with steam vessels of war, and Pensacola and some\r\npoint on the coast of Georgia or the eastern coast of Florida should be\r\nfortified. Turning then to personnel, he continued: “It takes something\r\nmore than spars and guns, and walls of wood to constitute a navy. These\r\nare only the body—the arms and legs without the thews and sinews.\r\nIt requires the muscle of the brawny seaman, and the spirit of the\r\nwell-trained officer to impart life and motion to such a body, to give\r\nvigor and energy to the whole system”.\r\n\r\nA real system of education for the navy should be devised. The army,\r\nhe said, had a Military Academy at West Point, “affording the most\r\nuseful and practical education to be obtained in the country”; while\r\nthe navy was forced to make out with inefficient schoolmasters on\r\nboard ship, and the midshipmen secured only a practical knowledge of\r\nseamanship, the manipulation of the sextant, a few rules by rote from\r\nBowditch’s “Epitome of Navigation”, and a knowledge of right-angled\r\nplane trigonometry. Maury claimed that a broader training was needed,\r\nand suggested the following subjects as requisite for study: drawing\r\nand naval architecture, gunnery and pyrotechny, chemistry and natural\r\nhistory, astronomy, mathematics, natural philosophy, navigation,\r\ntactics and discipline, gymnastics, international and maritime law, and\r\nlanguages (one of French, Spanish, or German and “that most difficult,\r\narbitrary, and careful of all languages, the English”). These subjects\r\nwere to be covered in a four years’ course, with a two months’ cruise\r\neach year, sometimes to foreign waters; while two years at sea after\r\ngraduation and an examination at the end of that period of service were\r\nto be required before a commission in the navy was to be awarded.\r\n\r\nAt first, Maury proposed merely a school-ship; but a little later\r\nafter his articles had been received with such favor by the public\r\nhe declared that his advocacy of a school-ship had been made solely\r\non the grounds of expediency and that he would hail with delight the\r\nestablishment of a school for the navy anywhere, even on the top of\r\nthe Rocky Mountains. He thereupon suggested Memphis, Tennessee as\r\na suitable place for the school, on the grounds that the East had\r\nthe Military Academy and the West should have the naval school, and\r\nbesides that this would be a favorable place for experimenting on\r\nsteam vessels on the Mississippi River. Though Maury was by no means\r\nthe first to suggest the need for such an institution, yet no other\r\nperson contributed so much as he did towards the education of public\r\nopinion and the preparation for the eventual establishment of the\r\nNaval Academy. It is with justice, therefore, that he has often been\r\nreferred to as the father of this famous institution.\r\n\r\nContinuing his discussion of the needs of the navy as to personnel,\r\nMaury recommended a reorganization and standardization of the number\r\nof officers in the various grades and a system of promotion that would\r\nkeep alive the spirit and ambition of the officers. Surplus officers,\r\nhe thought, might go into the merchant marine and constitute a naval\r\nreserve; while the revenue service should be taken over by the regular\r\nnavy.\r\n\r\nMaury then turned to the question of material and devoted a great\r\ndeal of attention to the graft and inefficiency connected with the\r\nbuilding and repairing of ships. “Honorable legislators”, he wrote,\r\n“are warned that the evils are deeply seated in the system itself, and\r\nare not to be removed by merely the plucking of a leaf, or the lopping\r\noff of a limb: the axe must be laid at the root—for nothing short of\r\nthorough and complete reorganization will do”. His attack was directed\r\nparticularly against the Board of Navy Commissioners; and when this\r\nboard attempted a reply, he answered with the most devastating article\r\nof the whole series, in which he piled up figures, and multiplied\r\ninstances of graft and ruinous waste. As a summary, he wrote, “Vessels\r\nare built at twice the sum they ought to cost—they are repaired at\r\ntwice as much as it takes to build—the labor to repair costs three\r\ntimes as much as the labor to construct—the same articles for one ship\r\ncost four or five times as much as their duplicates for another—it\r\ncosts twice as much to _repair_ ordnance and stores for a ship as it\r\ntakes to buy them”. Maury advocated in place of this board a bureau\r\nsystem with divided responsibility. The Secretary of the Navy, he\r\nthought, should have an assistant under-secretary, who should be a\r\npost captain in the navy and have general oversight over the various\r\nbureaus. Then promotions would be taken out of politics, and the old\r\nsaying that “a cruise of a few months in Washington tells more than\r\na three years’ cruise at sea in an officer’s favor” would lose its\r\nsignificance.\r\n\r\nIn his attempt to improve conditions in the naval service, Maury had\r\nthe sympathy of a large number of his brother officers, some of whom\r\ngave practical expression to their feeling by clubbing together and\r\nhaving large editions of the “Scraps from the Lucky Bag” printed for\r\nfree distribution. In the month of July, 1841 there appeared a sketch\r\nof Maury in the _Southern Literary Messenger_, in which his name was\r\nfor the first time connected with the authorship of the articles. It\r\nwas written by a “Brother Officer”, who said that the “Scraps from the\r\nLucky Bag” had produced “an enthusiasm which has not subsided and will\r\nnot subside until the whole navy is reorganized”. Such indeed was the\r\noutcome. Congress took up the matter, and many of Maury’s suggested\r\nreforms were at once instituted, while practically everything that he\r\ncontended for was eventually adopted for the naval service. So famous\r\ndid Maury become through the publication of these articles that the\r\nPresident was urged to place him at the head of the Navy Department;\r\nand at one time President Tyler had actually made up his mind to make\r\nhim his Secretary of the Navy in spite of the fact that he was then but\r\na lieutenant.\r\n\r\nIn November, 1841, Maury made another request for active service.\r\nIn order that his family and friends might not defeat his purpose,\r\nhe went to Richmond and from there wrote to Secretary of the Navy\r\nGeorge E. Badger, suggesting that he was able to perform any of the\r\nlighter duties at sea which did not call for much bodily exercise, and\r\nrequesting that he be appointed flag-lieutenant in the Pacific Squadron\r\nunder Commodore Jones, who had signified a desire to have him in this\r\npost. His purpose, however, was thwarted by Judge John T. Lomax, a warm\r\npersonal friend, who wrote to the Secretary and enclosed a certificate\r\nfrom three of the best physicians of Fredericksburg to the effect that\r\nMaury was in no condition for life on board ship; and as a consequence\r\nhe was retained on the list of those “waiting orders”.\r\n\r\nAfter the completion of his “Scraps from the Lucky Bag”, Maury\r\ncontinued to write for the _Southern Literary Messenger_; he rendered\r\neditorial service to Mr. White, the owner of the magazine, during the\r\nyear 1842, and was virtually the editor during the first eight months\r\nof 1843 after White’s death. He contributed also to the _Army and Navy\r\nChronicle_ and the _Southern Quarterly Review_ of Charleston.\r\n\r\nHis “Letters to Clay” in the _Messenger_ under the pseudonym of “Union\r\nJack” strongly advocated the establishment of a national dockyard at\r\nMemphis, government subsidies for the building of steam packets as\r\nEngland and France were doing, a national steamboat canal from the\r\nupper Mississippi River to the Lakes for defense against Canada in\r\ncase of war with Great Britain, a strong naval establishment at some\r\nplace on the Atlantic seaboard south of Norfolk, and the making of\r\nPensacola a veritable “Toulon on the Mediterranean”. The following\r\nyear, 1842, he took up in the same journal the question of the right of\r\nGreat Britain to visit and search American ships in the “suspicious”\r\nlatitudes off Africa in the endeavor to suppress the slave trade. He\r\nwas against according this right to England because of the temptation\r\nto use the power involved in an arbitrary manner greatly to the injury\r\nof American commerce, and he was of the opinion that it was merely\r\nan attempt, under the pretext of supporting the “Christian League”\r\nor Quintuple Alliance, to revive the old claim of England’s right to\r\nviolate sailors’ rights and the freedom of the seas, principles fought\r\nfor in the War of 1812. He referred, in passing, to the tense feeling\r\nagainst Great Britain on account of the Maine Boundary dispute, and the\r\ndesire, on the part of many, even for war. “On the contrary”, he wrote,\r\n“I should view a war between the United States and Great Britain as one\r\nof the greatest calamities, except a scourge direct from the hand of\r\nGod, that could befall my country”. But he added, “In the navy, there\r\nis but one sentiment and one feeling on this subject; it is, avert war,\r\nhonorably if you can; if not, let it come: right or wrong, the stars\r\nand stripes shall not be disgraced on the ocean”.\r\n\r\nHe too was opposed to the slave trade, and thought that the United\r\nStates would be glad to coöperate with Great Britain and furnish\r\nwarships for the purpose; but he doubted the sincerity of England,\r\nand referred pointedly to the “hosts of murdered Chinese who prefer\r\ninstant death at the mouth of British cannon to the slow poison of\r\na British drug”,—the opium that was at that time being forced upon\r\nthem by the British government. His conclusion was this: “When the\r\nBritish government shall cease to sell its captured slaves—when it\r\nshall abandon its intrigues for the right of search which has done the\r\nAfricans so much more harm than good—and shall advocate some such\r\npractical plan as this (coöperation) for the suppression of the slave\r\ntrade, then and not till then will we give the ‘old country’ credit for\r\nmotives of humanity and a sincere desire to succor the slave”.\r\n\r\nThese were the last articles that Maury wrote before he was appointed\r\nto an office of great potential importance, which was to afford the\r\nappropriate place for the complete flowering of his peculiar genius.\r\nThis appointment was given to him largely because of his writings;\r\nnamely, his “New Theoretical and Practical Treatise on Navigation”,\r\n“Scraps from the Lucky Bag”, and other magazine articles. It might be\r\nsaid, therefore, that though he had been faithful in the performance\r\nof all the duties of his profession and, courageous as he was, would\r\nalmost certainly have distinguished himself in warfare, yet up to this\r\npoint in his career the pen, as an instrument for acquiring fame, had\r\nindeed been mightier than the sword.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER IV\r\n\r\n                         HIS ASTRONOMICAL WORK\r\n\r\n\r\nMaury took charge, on July 1, 1842, of the Depot of Charts and\r\nInstruments, of which he had just been made the superintendent by\r\nSecretary of the Navy Upshur. This depot had been established by the\r\nNavy Department in 1830, and Lieutenants Goldsborough, Wilkes, and\r\nGilliss in succession had been its former superintendents. Wilkes had\r\nmoved it from the western part of the city to Capitol Hill probably,\r\nas has been suggested, that its virtues and its needs might the more\r\nreadily be noticed by Congress. Be that as it may, Congress passed an\r\nact on August 31, 1842, appropriating the sum of $35,000 for supplying\r\nadequate buildings and equipment for the depot. On the same day was\r\npassed another act, which dissolved the Board of Navy Commissioners\r\nthat had ruled the navy for twenty-seven years and had recently been\r\nattacked so forcefully by Maury, and established the Bureau System in\r\nits place. The Depot of Charts and Instruments, accordingly, was placed\r\nunder the Bureau of Ordnance and Hydrography.\r\n\r\nImmediately after becoming superintendent, Maury moved the depot to\r\na building between 24th and 25th Streets, N. W., known formerly as\r\n2222–24 Pennsylvania Avenue, and to the rather limited accommodations\r\nhere he brought his family. Meanwhile a new building was being\r\nconstructed on a reservation at 23d and E Streets, N. W., where\r\nthe Naval Medical School is now located,—a site covering about\r\nseventeen acres which had been reserved by General Washington for a\r\ngreat university. This new building was to be of brick, in the form\r\nof a square about 50 feet by 50, surmounted by a dome 23 feet in\r\ndiameter, with wings to the south, east, and west. Later, in 1847, the\r\nsuperintendent’s residence was constructed and connected with the main\r\nbuilding by an extension of the east wing.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n  AN ENGRAVING OF THE UNITED STATES NAVAL OBSERVATORY BUILDINGS AS\r\n  THEY APPEARED WHEN MAURY WAS SUPERINTENDENT ABOUT 1845\r\n\r\n  From an engraving in the title page of “Astronomical and\r\n  Meteorological Observations Made during the Year 1875, at the U. S.\r\n  Naval Observatory,” 1878.]\r\n\r\nThe name of the institution varied. As the Depot of Charts and\r\nInstruments it was officially known from 1830 to 1844; but for the\r\nnext ten years the names Naval Observatory and National Observatory\r\nwere used indiscriminately, sometimes even in the same publication.\r\nIn December, 1854, the Secretary of the Navy instructed that it\r\nshould henceforth be called the United States Naval Observatory and\r\nHydrographical Office, and as such it was known until the establishment\r\nof the Hydrographic Office as a separate division in 1866. Since that\r\ndate the official name of the institution has been the United States\r\nNaval Observatory.\r\n\r\nNear the close of September, 1844, the Observatory was reported to be\r\ncompleted, and on October 1 Maury was ordered to take charge with a\r\nstaff of line officers and professors of mathematics of the navy, and\r\ncivilian professors. Lieutenant James M. Gilliss, Maury’s predecessor,\r\nhad been greatly interested in astronomy, especially that field of\r\nthe science having to do with navigation, and it was largely through\r\nhis exertions that the necessary legislation had been passed making\r\npossible a building, adapted not merely to the housing of charts and\r\ninstruments but suitable as well for astronomical observations. He had\r\nbeen sent to Europe to consult about the purchasing of instruments for\r\nthe new Observatory, and there were those who thought that he should\r\nhave been made its first superintendent.\r\n\r\nHowever scantily informed Maury may have been in the beginning as to\r\nthe great advance in astronomical science recently made in Europe, his\r\ngreat energy and native ability soon enabled him to overcome any such\r\nhandicaps. He assisted with his own hands in the installation of the\r\ninstruments, in which he took great delight, writing that the Great\r\nRefraction Circle was such an exquisite piece of machinery and so\r\nbeautiful that he would like to wear it round his neck as an ornament.\r\nHe was constantly endeavoring to secure better and larger instruments,\r\nand wrote with pride when the Observatory, as far as equipment was\r\nconcerned, became the second most important in the world and needed\r\nonly a larger telescope to make it the very first of all. Maury quickly\r\nsaw the value of the Electro-Chronograph, invented by John Locke of\r\nCincinnati, in determining longitude with the aid of the magnetic\r\ntelegraph, seeing that it would practically double the number of\r\nobservations that one observer could make; and it was largely through\r\nhim that Congress was persuaded to appropriate the $10,000 necessary\r\nfor installing the instrument at the Observatory.\r\n\r\nMaury was, moreover, by no means a mere figurehead in the making of\r\nastronomical observations, but soon mastered the details of this work\r\nwhich might have been left wholly to his subordinates. During the first\r\ntwo years he was the principal observer with the equatorial, and it\r\nis interesting to note how often his name appears as the observer in\r\nthe published extracts from the notebooks of the Observatory. That he\r\nhad much more than a mere passing interest in astronomy is evident\r\nfrom the following account of his emotions during an astronomical\r\nobservation: “To me the simple passage through the transit instrument\r\nof a star across the meridian is the height of astronomical sublimity.\r\nAt the dead hour of the night, when the world is hushed in sleep and\r\nall is still; when there is not a sound to be heard save the dead beat\r\nescapement of the clock, counting with hollow voice the footsteps of\r\ntime in his ceaseless round, I turn to the Ephemeris and find there, by\r\ncalculation made years ago, that when that clock tells a certain hour,\r\na star which I never saw will be in the field of the telescope for a\r\nmoment, flit through, and then disappear. The instrument is set;—I\r\nlook; the star, mute with eloquence that gathers sublimity from the\r\nsilence of the night, comes smiling and dancing into the field, and at\r\nthe instant predicted even to the fraction of a second it makes its\r\ntransit and is gone! With emotions too deep for the organs of speech,\r\nthe heart swells out with unutterable anthems; we then see that there\r\nis harmony in the heavens above; and though we cannot hear, we feel the\r\n‘music of the spheres’”.[3]\r\n\r\nMaury’s first volume of astronomical observations, the first indeed to\r\nbe issued from an American observatory, appeared in 1846. Though this\r\nwas pioneer work, it was important enough to cause one of the most\r\ndistinguished astronomers of Europe to conclude that it had placed\r\nthe American observatory in the front rank with the oldest and best\r\ninstitutions of the kind in Europe. In the appendix to this volume,\r\nMaury gives very generous credit and praise to his helpers, among whom\r\nwere at this time the distinguished mathematicians Hubbard, Keith, and\r\nCoffin; but he adds that he considers himself alone responsible for\r\nthe accuracy of the work as nothing had been published until it had\r\npassed his supervision and approval.\r\n\r\nA very ambitious work which Maury began during the year 1845 was a\r\ncatalogue of the stars. The aim was to cover every point of space\r\nin the visible heavens with telescopes, get the position of every\r\nstar, cluster, and nebula, and record both magnitude and color, with\r\nthe angle of position and the distance of binary stars together with\r\ndescriptions and drawings of all clusters and nebulæ. No astronomical\r\nwork on such an extensive scale had ever before been executed or even\r\nattempted, though the value and importance of it were manifold and\r\ndifficult of full estimation. Maury wrote that it was his intention to\r\nmake a contribution to astronomy that would be worthy of the nation\r\nand the age, and to so execute the undertaking that future astronomers\r\nwould value it so highly as to say that such a star was not visible in\r\nthe heavens at the date of the Washington Catalogue because it is not\r\nrecorded therein.\r\n\r\nAn interesting example of the extremely practical value of such a\r\ncatalogue came up in connection with Leverrier’s discovery of the\r\nplanet Neptune. In the autumn of 1846, after the discovery of this\r\nplanet, Maury ordered one of his observers to trace its path backwards\r\nto see if some astronomer had observed it and entered it as a fixed\r\nstar. On February 1, 1847, the observer, Sears Cook Walker, gave a list\r\nof fourteen stars from Lalande’s catalogue in his “Histoire Céleste”,\r\nwhere Neptune should have been approximately in May, 1795. Professor\r\nHubbard was then directed by Maury to examine with the equatorial,\r\nand he found on the night of February 4 that the suspected star was\r\nmissing. It was concluded, therefore, that Lalande had observed and\r\nrecorded Neptune as a fixed star on the nights of May 8 and 10, 1795.\r\nThis discovery enabled astronomers to compute the new planet’s orbit\r\nfrom observations extending over a period of fifty years.\r\n\r\nThe work on this catalogue was carried forward industriously for\r\nseveral years, but the results were not ready to be published in the\r\nvolume of observations for the year 1846 because of the continual\r\ndrafts on the personnel of the Observatory for sea duty, which made\r\nit impossible for the computers to keep pace with the observers.\r\nEventually, Maury was compelled to abandon the hope of ever finishing a\r\ncomplete catalogue of the stars, as at first planned. The observations\r\ncontinued to be made, however, and by January of 1855 the number of\r\nstars which had been so observed reached the grand total of 100,000;\r\nbut these results were not published until 1873, long after Maury’s\r\nsuperintendency had come to a close. Maury would never have undertaken\r\nsuch an ambitious work, if he had realized the Herculean labor involved\r\nin the cataloguing of all the stars down to the 10th magnitude in all\r\nthe heavens from 45° south to the North Pole, a colossal undertaking\r\nthat was entirely beyond the capacity of any one observatory to\r\naccomplish in a generation.\r\n\r\nThe appearance of the second volume of astronomical observations was\r\ndelayed because of the inroads made on Maury’s staff by the demands\r\nof the Mexican War. Then when the work was on the point of being\r\npublished it was destroyed by a fire which burned the printing office.\r\nSo the volume did not appear until the year 1851; and as the years\r\nwent by publications fell further and further behind the observations.\r\nThere is no doubt but that Maury was greatly handicapped by the\r\nassignment of officers to the Observatory for irregular periods, and\r\nby the reduction of the number of his mathematicians as time went\r\nby. There was, besides, the hydrographical work of his office which\r\nmade constantly increasing demands on him and his staff. When he was\r\nforced by this lack in personnel to make a choice between the more\r\ncomplete development of astronomical observations on the one hand, and\r\nhydrographical and meteorological research on the other, he wisely\r\nchose the latter as of more immediate and practical value to the United\r\nStates, and indeed to the entire world.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n  _Courtesy of “The Journal of American History,” Vol. IV, Number 3\r\n  (1910)._\r\n\r\n  DECORATIONS CONFERRED UPON MAURY\r\n\r\n  (From reader’s left to right) First and fourth are the obverse and\r\n  reverse of the decoration of the Tower and Sword conferred by the\r\n  King of Portugal.

F. Maury, U.\r\nS. Navy”. This is an appropriate memorial to Maury’s most practical\r\ncontribution to science,—that which has given him the name “Pathfinder\r\nof the Seas”.\r\n\r\nFor a long time he had recognized the need for charts showing the winds\r\nand currents of the sea at different seasons; and it will be remembered\r\nthat, when he was sailing master of the _Falmouth_, 1831–1833, he was\r\nfirst made to realize how little of the nautical experience of other\r\nsailors could be taken advantage of by one about to set out on a long\r\nvoyage. On the way down to Rio in this ship he first conceived the\r\nidea of a wind and current chart; but he had no opportunity to make\r\npractical investigations into the meteorology of the sea until the\r\nyear 1842, when he was placed in charge of the Depot of Charts and\r\nInstruments.\r\n\r\nHe had been in this office but a short time when he set about examining\r\nthe old log books which had been stored away as so much rubbish by the\r\nNavy Department. By the middle of the year 1843, these investigations\r\nhad proved so illuminating that he was able to write a paper, which was\r\nread before the National Institute, on “Blank Charts on Board Public\r\nCruisers”. According to his plan, these charts were to have parallels\r\nand meridians showing the latitude and longitude laid down upon them,\r\nand the commanders of ships were to be requested to lay off on them the\r\ntracks of their vessels every day, and indicate as well the time of the\r\nyear, the direction of the winds, the force and set of the currents,\r\nand all other phenomena having a bearing on the navigation of the\r\nseas on which they sailed. Sailing directions, Maury declared in this\r\naddress, are now not a written branch of navigation but merely a matter\r\nof tradition among seamen. As to his contemplated chart, he boldly\r\nasserted that short passages are not due to luck and that “this chart\r\nproposes nothing less than to _blaze a way_ through the winds of the\r\nsea by which the navigator may find the best paths at all seasons”.\r\n\r\nNot having at that time made a name for himself as a scientist, Maury\r\nthought it wise to seek the support of the National Institute, and\r\nasked that a committee be appointed from its members to wait upon\r\nSecretary of the Navy Upshur and invite his coöperation in authorizing\r\nthat these charts be kept on all public cruisers. Such coöperation was,\r\nafter a fashion, granted, and Maury drew up a letter of instructions\r\nat the request of the Secretary. But as not much political capital\r\nwas to be made of it, the matter ended with the issuing of a set of\r\ninstructions to Commodore Biddle who was on the point of sailing\r\nfor China in the _Columbus_. Maury then asked permission of the\r\nBureau of Ordnance and Hydrography to make a chart of the Atlantic\r\nAmerican seaboard. He was ashamed, he wrote, of the meagerness of the\r\ncontributions of the United States to the general fund of nautical\r\nscience, and called attention to the fact that even the charts used by\r\nan American man-of-war in making her way up the Chesapeake Bay toward\r\nWashington had to be secured from the English Admiralty, and that, if\r\nit were not for the Nautical Almanac of England or some other nation,\r\nabsent American ships could not find their way home and those in port\r\ncould not lift their anchors and grope to sea with any certainty of\r\nfinding their way back again.\r\n\r\nAt about the same time Maury began the compilation of a chart of the\r\nNorth Atlantic for the purpose of laying down upon it the tracks of\r\nvessels in all seasons of the year, with the currents, prevailing\r\nwinds, temperature of the water, etc. At first, he had the intention\r\nof delineating the track of each vessel on the chart but he soon saw\r\nthat it would be impossible to do so on the scale adopted (one inch\r\nto the degree), and he then resorted to the plan of tabulating the\r\nresults only instead of marking the track. It was not until the autumn\r\nof 1847 that his researches, which had then extended over nearly five\r\nyears, had reached the point where he could publish his first “Wind and\r\nCurrent Chart of the North Atlantic”. This chart was founded entirely\r\nupon information derived from the old discarded log books of the\r\nNavy Department, for he had not then secured much coöperation in the\r\nacquiring of new data. Maury compared his work in the “quarry of log\r\nbooks” to that of a sculptor, the single touch of whose chisel does but\r\nlittle; but finally like the completed piece of statuary the charts\r\nspeak for themselves and stand out before the compiler “eloquent with\r\nfacts which the philosopher had never dreamed were lurking near”.\r\n\r\nEarly in the year 1848 Maury issued what he called an “Abstract Log\r\nfor the Use of American Navigators”. This was devised to secure the\r\ncoöperation of navigators in gathering information for perfecting his\r\ncharts. It contained but ten pages together with some blank forms, and\r\nwas the very modest beginning of what he afterwards issued as “Sailing\r\nDirections”, which eventually grew to the enormous size of 1257 pages\r\nin two volumes in quarto. The purpose of the little pamphlet was to\r\ninterpret the meaning and the significance of the wind and current\r\nchart which had recently been issued, and to furnish instructions to\r\nnavigators for the proper keeping of the abstract log on their voyages.\r\nThey were to enter in this log the latitude and longitude every day at\r\nnoon; the hourly rate of the currents expressed in knots; the variation\r\nof the compass; the reading of the thermometer, in both air and water,\r\nat nine o’clock each morning; the state of the barometer just before,\r\nduring, and just after a gale of wind with the changes and time of\r\nchanges in the direction of the wind during the gale; careful entries\r\nas to the direction and force of the winds every eight hours; and other\r\nmarine phenomena such as whales, flocks of birds, rains and fogs, etc.,\r\netc. When properly filled out, these logs were to be sent to Maury\r\nat the Observatory where the information would be tabulated. It was\r\nalso suggested that tightly corked bottles containing the latitude and\r\nlongitude, and the date be thrown overboard at stated times, and that\r\nsuch floating bottles be picked up when seen, and the place and time be\r\ncarefully noted in the abstract log. Those who agreed to coöperate in\r\nthese various ways were to receive free of cost a copy of the “Wind and\r\nCurrent Chart of the North Atlantic”.\r\n\r\nMaury predicted confidently that, by following his directions, the\r\naverage 55 days’ voyage from New York to Rio by the old route might be\r\nshortened by from 10 to 15 days. This prediction was fulfilled by the\r\nbarque _W. H. D. C. Wright_ of Baltimore, which early in 1848 went\r\nfrom the Capes of Virginia to Rio in 35 days and returned in 40 days,\r\nby following Maury’s directions. This created considerable interest in\r\nthe new charts, and the number of those willing to coöperate in the new\r\nresearch on the sea constantly increased from year to year. Maury had\r\nlong looked forward to the prospect of no longer being compelled to\r\nsearch through cartloads of manuscripts and dusty log books, kept in\r\nyears gone by without system and with little or no regard to the facts\r\nwhich he wished to obtain from them, but of having as co-laborers a\r\nthousand or more vessels every year engaged in collecting exactly the\r\ninformation required so that it would come to his hands precisely in\r\nthe form in which it was desired. In this he was not to be disappointed\r\nfor by the close of the year 1848 he was able to write that his charts\r\nwere eagerly sought by navigators and that some five or six thousand\r\nof them had been distributed during the year to American shipmasters.\r\nBy no means all of these navigators kept their part of the agreement\r\nand sent in to Maury their abstract logs properly filled out; but\r\nenough data kept coming in to keep his staff of helpers constantly at\r\nwork turning out his various charts. By 1851, he could write that more\r\nthan one thousand ships in all the oceans were observing for him, and\r\nthat enough material had been collected from abstract logs to make two\r\nhundred large manuscript volumes each averaging from two thousand to\r\nthree thousand days’ observations.\r\n\r\nThese “Wind and Current Charts” included Track Charts, Trade Wind\r\nCharts, Pilot Charts, Thermal Charts, Storm and Rain Charts, and Whale\r\nCharts. The Track Charts showed the frequented parts of the ocean, the\r\ngeneral character of the weather and wind, and the force and direction\r\nof the latter at different seasons of the year. The Trade Wind Charts\r\ngave the limits, extent, and general characteristics of the trade wind\r\nregions, together with their neighboring zones of calms. The Pilot\r\nCharts showed in every square of fifteen degrees the direction of the\r\nwind for sixteen points of the compass that would probably be found\r\nin that square during each month of the year, the results being based\r\nupon the number of times the wind was reported to have been from that\r\ndirection in former years. The Thermal Charts recorded the temperature\r\nof the surface of the ocean wherever and whenever it had been observed,\r\nthe different temperatures being distinguished by colors and symbols in\r\nsuch a manner that mere inspection of the chart showed the temperature\r\nfor any month. The Storm and Rain Charts demonstrated in every square\r\nof five degrees the number of observations that had been made for each\r\nmonth, the number of days in which there had been rain, a calm, fog,\r\nlightning and thunder, or a storm and the quarter from which it had\r\nblown. The Whale Charts, finally, showed where whales were most hunted,\r\nin what years and months they had been most frequently found, whether\r\nin shoals or as stragglers, and whether sperm or right whales.\r\n\r\nThough the coöperation which Maury enjoyed was an extensive one, he was\r\nstill not satisfied, and as early as 1851 he conceived the idea of a\r\nuniversal system of meteorological observations on both land and sea.\r\nThrough the advice of British scientists, he decided to confine his\r\nsystem, for the time being, only to the sea, though he was afterwards\r\nto regret such a curtailment of his original scheme. With the authority\r\nof Secretary of the Navy William A. Graham, to whom Maury was greatly\r\nindebted for very generous support in furthering his ambitious project,\r\nhe set to work through diplomatic representatives of foreign countries\r\nat Washington to interest as many meteorologists as possible in the\r\nconvening of an international meteorological conference. The United\r\nStates also was asked to coöperate, through letters which Maury sent to\r\nthe various Cabinet Members, heads of the Coast Survey, the Bureau of\r\nEngineers, and the Smithsonian Institute, and other scientists. Paris\r\nwas at first considered to be a suitable place for the meeting; but\r\neventually Brussels was chosen, and the following nations accepted the\r\ninvitation to send representatives: Belgium, Denmark, France, Great\r\nBritain, Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Russia, Sweden, and the United\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nMaury, as the representative of the United States, sailed from New York\r\non July 23, 1853, by way of England. Upon landing at Liverpool, he was\r\ninvited to address the merchants in the City Hall on the subject of the\r\nuniform plan of observation at sea, and the following month he spoke\r\nto the underwriters and shipowners of London at Lloyd’s on the same\r\nsubject. These speeches produced a more cordial coöperation on the part\r\nof the British government which had previously been rather lukewarm in\r\nits attitude toward the undertaking.\r\n\r\nThe conference was convened at the residence of the Minister of the\r\nInterior in Brussels on August 23, 1853, and Jacques Adolphe Lambert\r\nQuetelet, Director of the Royal Observatory of Belgium, was made\r\nits president. Maury was requested to direct the proceedings of the\r\nconference, but he declined the honor. He was then asked by the\r\npresident to state the purposes of the meeting, and after his short\r\nintroductory address President Quetelet proposed that the conference\r\npass a vote of thanks to Maury and record their gratitude for the\r\n“enlightened zeal and earnestness” he had displayed in the important\r\nand useful work which formed the subject of their deliberations. This,\r\nof course, was unanimously passed. The discussions went on daily with\r\nthe greatest harmony, until the close of the conference on September\r\n8. The results were the adoption of an abstract log for the use of\r\nthe men-of-war of all nations and also one for all merchantmen to use\r\nin the system of coöperative observations. Full explanatory notes for\r\nthe keeping of these logs in such a way as to cover all the phenomena\r\nof the ocean were agreed upon, and the hope was expressed that these\r\nabstract logs might enjoy in time of war the same immunity that was\r\naccorded to vessels engaged in discovery or other scientific research.\r\n\r\nThe Brussels Conference was an unqualified success, and Maury was very\r\nenthusiastic over the new chapter of Marine Meteorology which was\r\nabout to be opened in the volume of Nature. “Rarely before”, he wrote\r\nsomewhat later, “has there been such a sublime spectacle presented\r\nto the scientific world: all nations agreeing to unite and coöperate\r\nin carrying out one system of philosophical research with regard to\r\nthe sea. Though they may be enemies in all else, here they are to be\r\nfriends. Every ship that navigates the high seas, with these charts and\r\nblank abstract logs on board, may henceforth be regarded as a floating\r\nobservatory, a temple of science”.[4]\r\n\r\nSoon after the conference, Prussia, Spain, Sardinia, the free city of\r\nHamburg, the republic of Bremen, Chile, Austria, and Brazil, all joined\r\nthe enterprise; and the Pope established honorary flags of distinction\r\nfor the ships of the papal states, which could be awarded only to those\r\nvessels which kept the abstract logs of the Brussels Conference.\r\n\r\nMaury took with him on this mission to Europe his two eldest daughters\r\nand their cousins Ellen Herndon and Ellen Maury, who were dubbed by\r\nacclamation on the steamer the “Magpie Club”. In England the party was\r\ninvited to Wrottesley Hall near Wolverhampton, by Lord Wrottesley, then\r\nPresident of the Royal and Astronomical Societies, with whom Maury had\r\ncorresponded for several years. Before returning to America, he and his\r\n“Magpie Club” traveled in France, Holland, and Germany, and visited the\r\ngreat scientist Humboldt, whose “Cosmos” had greatly influenced Maury’s\r\nscientific ideas.\r\n\r\nBack at home again, Maury took up his work with renewed energy, and\r\nwith the data which came in, through the greatly increased coöperation,\r\nfrom all quarters and in many different languages, he revised his\r\ncharts of the North and South Atlantic, and of the North and South\r\nPacific, and then charted the Indian Ocean as well. Not only was\r\nthe route to Rio definitely decreased by one fourth, but also other\r\npassages began to be shortened with the accompanying saving for all the\r\nmen and commerce that used Maury’s suggested routes. The gold rush to\r\nCalifornia, which began in 1849, vastly increased the shipping from the\r\nAtlantic ports of the United States to San Francisco. Time then became\r\na more important element in that passage than ever before, and in\r\n1850 clipper ships were launched for this particular trade, with the\r\nobject of making the voyage as short as possible. It was, therefore,\r\na splendid opportunity for putting Maury’s charts to the test, and\r\nthe practical results of his new sailing directions soon displayed\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\nBefore his charts came to be used, the average passage from New York\r\nto San Francisco was about 180 days, but by the year 1855 the average\r\npassage between those ports for the year round had been reduced to 133\r\ndays. Moreover, there were dozens of clipper ships which, under Maury’s\r\ndirections, made the voyage in 110 days or even less. The record was\r\nmade in 1851 by the _Flying Cloud_, which fairly flew over the passage\r\nin 89 days and 21 hours, during one day making the extraordinary\r\ndistance of 433½ statute miles or sailing at the rate of 18 statute\r\nmiles per hour. This exploit was celebrated with great rejoicing in San\r\nFrancisco, because the inhabitants felt that they had been brought so\r\nmuch nearer to their old homes in the East.\r\n\r\nUnder the circumstances it was but natural that there should be races\r\namong the clipper ships. The route from New York to San Francisco\r\nbecame the great racecourse of the ocean, fifteen thousand miles in\r\nlength. As Maury wrote, “Some of the most glorious trials of speed\r\nand prowess that the world ever witnessed, among ships that ‘walk the\r\nwaters’, have taken place over it. Here the modern clipper ship—the\r\nnoblest work that has ever come from the hands of man—has been sent,\r\nguided by the lights of science, to contend with the elements, to\r\noutstrip steam, and astonish the world”.[5] There was the great race in\r\n1851 of the _Raven_, the _Typhoon_, and the _Sea Witch_, which was won\r\nby the first-mentioned in 105 days, though the year before this same\r\nship had made the run in 97 days.\r\n\r\nAnother famous race was run during the winter of 1852–1853, and the\r\nships which engaged in it were the _Wild Pigeon_, _John Gilpin_,\r\n_Flying Fish_, and _Trade Wind_. These ships, as were those in the\r\nformer race, were all furnished with Maury’s charts. After a most\r\ninteresting and exciting race, the _Flying Fish_ won in just 92 days\r\nand 4 hours, though the _John Gilpin_ was a close second, making the\r\npassage in 93 days and 20 hours. In commenting on these results,\r\nMaury wrote, “Here are ships sailing on different days, bound over a\r\ntrackless waste of ocean for some fifteen thousand miles or more, and\r\ndepending alone on the fickle winds of heaven, as they are called, to\r\nwaft them along; yet, like travelers on the land bound upon the same\r\njourney, they pass and repass, fall in with and recognize each other by\r\nthe way; and what, perhaps, is still more remarkable is the fact that\r\nthese ships should each, throughout that great distance and under the\r\nwonderful vicissitudes of climates, winds, and currents, which they\r\nencountered, have been so skillfully navigated that, in looking back at\r\ntheir management, now that what is past is before me, I do not find a\r\nsingle occasion, except the one already mentioned, on which they could\r\nhave been better handled.... Am I far wrong, therefore, when I say\r\nthat the present state of our knowledge, with regard to the physical\r\ngeography of the sea, has enabled the navigator to blaze his way among\r\nthe winds and currents of the sea, and so mark his path that others,\r\nusing his signs as finger-boards, may follow in the same track?”[6]\r\n\r\nThe degree of exactness which Maury’s knowledge of the sea had reached\r\nis best illustrated by the incident of the _San Francisco_. This ship,\r\nbound from New York to San Francisco with a regiment of soldiers\r\non board, was disabled in a hurricane on the day before Christmas,\r\n1853 while crossing the Gulf Stream about 300 miles from Sandy Hook.\r\nHer position on the following day, and the next day after that, was\r\nreported by passing vessels which were, however, unable to render\r\nher assistance. Maury was then asked by the Secretary of the Navy to\r\ncalculate her position for the assistance of the two relief ships which\r\nwere to be dispatched in search of the unfortunate vessel. Although\r\nthree other ships, the _Kilby_, the _Three Bells_, and the _Antarctic_,\r\nfell in with the wreck and rescued the remainder of her passengers,\r\nafter 179 men had been washed overboard, yet it is an astonishing fact\r\nthat Maury had so accurately guided the two searching revenue cutters\r\nthat one of them went within sight of the spot where the drifting\r\nvessel had shortly before been found.\r\n\r\nThere was still another important passage that Maury aided materially\r\nin shortening. This was the voyage from England to Australia and New\r\nZealand. He opposed the British Admiralty route which passed near\r\nthe Cape of Good Hope, and advised ships to sail 600 to 800 miles\r\nfurther westward and then to continue southward until they reached the\r\nprevailing strong westerly winds which drove the clippers onward at a\r\ntremendous rate. He advised them, when homeward bound, to continue in\r\nthose “brave west winds” and return by way of Cape Horn. A voyage out\r\nto Australia and home again, accordingly, encircled the globe. Whereas\r\nby the old route it had taken about 120 days each way on the average,\r\nby Maury’s new route the passage for American sailings was decreased\r\nby one third and that for the British by about one fifth.\r\n\r\nThis shortening of ships’ passages amounted to a vast saving to\r\nthe commerce of the world. It was estimated that the annual saving\r\nto British commerce in the Indian Ocean alone, from Maury’s charts\r\nand sailing directions, amounted to $1,000,000 at least, and the\r\namount saved to British commerce in all seas reached the stupendous\r\nsum of $10,000,000 annually. As to the United States, it has been\r\nconservatively estimated that the saving for the outward voyage alone\r\nfrom her Atlantic and California ports to those of South America,\r\nAustralia, China, and the East Indies amounted to $2,250,000 per annum.\r\n\r\nFor many years the scientific world rang with Maury’s praise, though\r\nthere were, of course, some detractors. In referring to these “closet\r\nmen of science” who claimed that he pushed his speculations oftentimes\r\nbeyond the limits which the facts before him would authorize a prudent\r\nand cautious investigator to go, he wrote that the true problem with\r\nwhich he had to deal was to use his opportunities so as to produce\r\nthe greatest good to the greatest numbers, and that he was willing to\r\nbe judged by the fruits of his labor. Furthermore, he announced again\r\nand again in his “Sailing Directions” the following rule by which his\r\ninvestigations had always been guided: “To keep the mind unbiased by\r\ntheories and speculations; never to have any wish that an investigation\r\nwould result in favor of this view in preference to that, and never\r\nto attempt by premature speculation to anticipate the results of\r\ninvestigation, but always to trust to the observations”.\r\n\r\nIn spite of his great achievements, Maury’s own countrymen were rather\r\nbackward about rewarding him. The University of North Carolina\r\nconferred upon him an A.M. degree in 1847 and a LL.D. in 1852, and\r\nColumbia University made him a Doctor of Laws in 1854. A. A. Low and\r\nBrothers of New York named one of their clipper barques in his honor in\r\n1855. But the most substantial reward bestowed upon him in the United\r\nStates came in 1853, when the merchants and underwriters of New York\r\npresented him a fine silver service and a purse of $5000 in recognition\r\nfor what he had done for the commerce of that great port. Six years\r\nlater, a testimonial signed by 363 different American shipowners,\r\nmasters, and merchants was sent to him as an expression of their\r\n“personal regard and esteem”.\r\n\r\nThe reports of the various Secretaries of the Navy from 1850 to 1855\r\nreferred in the highest terms of appreciation to the hydrographical\r\nwork which Maury was doing. Secretary Graham went so far as to write,\r\n“Indeed, I doubt whether the triumphs of navigation and the knowledge\r\nof the sea, achieved under your superintendence of the Observatory,\r\nwill not contribute as much to an effective naval service and to\r\nthe national fame as the brilliant trophies of our arms”. Still,\r\nnotwithstanding this official praise, Maury was kept in the rank of\r\nlieutenant, and an attempt made in the Senate in January, 1855 to\r\nsecure an appropriation of $25,000, as “some substantial evidence of\r\nthe appreciation of the benefits he has, by his labors, conferred\r\nupon his country”, came to nought; and a short time thereafter he was\r\ntreated with the greatest cruelty by the Navy Department which placed\r\nhim for a time in official disgrace and reduced his pay to $1200 per\r\nannum.\r\n\r\nAbroad, on the contrary, Maury received almost universal recognition,\r\nand the rulers of Europe seemed to vie with each other in conferring\r\nmedals and decorations upon him. Up to the time of the outbreak of the\r\nCivil War, he had been made a member of some 45 learned societies,\r\nabout 20 of which were in foreign countries. He was made a knight\r\nof the Order of Dannebrog by the King of Denmark in 1856, and the\r\nfollowing year a knight of the Order of St. Anne by the Czar of Russia\r\nand a commander of the Legion of Honor by the Emperor of France; while\r\nin 1859 he had conferred upon him the Order of the Tower and Sword by\r\nthe King of Portugal. Moreover, between the years of 1854 and 1859\r\ngold medals were presented to him by the rulers of Norway and Sweden,\r\nPrussia, the republic of Bremen, Holland, Austria, Sardinia, and\r\nFrance; and in addition a medal of honor was awarded him for his charts\r\nat the Paris Universal Exhibition of 1855, and only the year before\r\nthe beginning of the Civil War the Pope sent him a set of thirteen\r\nbeautiful silver medals. There were two gold medals from Prussia;\r\nnamely, the medal designed for distinguished works of science and the\r\nCosmos Medal, which had been struck by the King of Prussia to honor\r\nHumboldt upon the publication of his “Cosmos” and which was given to\r\nMaury because of the warm personal friendship that had long existed\r\nbetween the two great scientists.\r\n\r\nThus was Maury’s resourcefulness and perseverance in investigating the\r\nwinds and currents of the sea and in presenting the results of his\r\nresearch in a practical form for the use of the mariners of the world\r\ncrowned with success; and whatever the future might hold in store for\r\nhim, he must have then realized that he had gained for himself an\r\nentrance into that small company of the world’s most distinguished\r\nscientists.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER VI\r\n\r\n                   HIS PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY OF THE SEA\r\n\r\n\r\nMaury’s investigations of the winds and currents of the sea led him\r\ninto researches connected with all the phenomena of the ocean, the\r\nresults of which were so extensive and so valuable as to win for him\r\nthe right to be called the first great oceanographer of the world.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of his work at the Depot of Charts and Instruments,\r\nhe uncovered in the old log books facts relating to the Gulf Stream,\r\nwhich led him to certain interesting conclusions concerning this great\r\nocean current that had not been previously recognized. In July, 1843\r\nhe gave an address before the President, the Corps Diplomatique, and\r\nimportant government officials on “The Gulf Stream and Its Causes”,\r\nwhich was reread with certain variations before several different\r\nlearned societies during the following year. He continued to write\r\nsuch scientific papers on topics bearing on oceanography, while he\r\nwas engaged in astronomical work and the preparation of his wind\r\nand current charts, and these papers, after being delivered before\r\nscientific societies, were published by him in the astronomical\r\nand meteorological publications of his office. Of particular note\r\nwere those which appeared in the different editions of his “Sailing\r\nDirections” under such titles as “The Influence of the Gulf Stream\r\non the Trade of Charleston”, “The Currents of the Sea”, “On the\r\nSaltness of the Sea”, “On the General Circulation of the Atmosphere”,\r\n“Red Fogs and Sea Dust”, “On the Probable Relation between Magnetism\r\nand the Circulation of the Atmosphere”, “Of Clouds and Equatorial\r\nCloud Rings”, “On the Geological Agency of the Winds”, and “Deep Sea\r\nSoundings”.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n  _Copy of engraving furnished by Captain E. T. Pollock, U. S. N.\r\n  Superintendent Naval Observatory._\r\n\r\n  COPY OF AN ENGRAVING OF MAURY WHICH HANGS IN THE SUPERINTENDENT’S\r\n  OFFICE AT THE UNITED STATES NAVAL OBSERVATORY]\r\n\r\nThe last-mentioned paper was made possible by the coöperation afforded\r\nby the government in authorizing in 1849 the Secretary of the Navy to\r\ndetail three suitable vessels to assist in Maury’s wind and current\r\ninvestigations and to order all ships of the navy to coöperate in so\r\nfar as it was compatible with the public interest. Maury had long had\r\na desire to explore the bottom of the ocean, and he now saw to it\r\nthat these ships especially detailed to help him were equipped and\r\nthoroughly instructed for making soundings. The first attempts were\r\nmade by the schooner _Taney_, under the command of Lieutenant J. C.\r\nWalsh, in the autumn of 1849. But her work was of negligible value,\r\nas she succeeded only in losing some 5700 fathoms of line as well\r\nas her deep-sea sounding apparatus, and then proved so unseaworthy\r\nthat she had to be condemned and sent back home under escort. Later,\r\nhowever, the results secured particularly by Captain Charles T. Platt\r\nin the sloop of war _Albany_ and by Lieutenants S. P. Lee and O. H.\r\nBerryman in the brig _Dolphin_ were of great importance. So extensive\r\nwas the data regarding soundings at Maury’s command by the close of\r\nthe year 1853 that he was able to publish in the sixth edition of his\r\n“Sailing Directions” (1854) ninety pages of matter under the heading of\r\n“Physical Geography of the Sea”.\r\n\r\nThis edition of the “Sailing Directions” was brought out by E. C. and\r\nJ. Biddle of Philadelphia, and when Maury’s nephew, Dabney Maury,\r\nwent to see the publishers about some question connected with its\r\npublication, one of the firm called his attention to the fact that\r\nMaury’s annual report contained materials for a most interesting\r\nand valuable book. He warned him that, unless the results of his\r\ninvestigations were thus guarded by a copyright, he would have the\r\nchagrin of seeing “some Yankee bookmaker steal his thunder and reap\r\na fortune from it”. By the next mail Maury was advised of this. He\r\nat once became interested in the undertaking and, with the advice of\r\nthe Biddles, arrangements were made with Harpers for the publication\r\nof such a book. It was begun in the spring of 1854, and finished and\r\nready for the publishers by June 20 of the same year. Maury was of the\r\nopinion that it was to be his “_great_ work”, and time certainly proved\r\nthat he had not overestimated its importance.\r\n\r\nThe title of the book was taken from one of the chapter headings in\r\nthe sixth edition of his “Sailing Directions”, and was originally\r\nsuggested to Maury by Humboldt, who wrote that Maury’s investigations\r\nhad produced an amount of useful information sufficient, in his\r\nopinion, to constitute a new department of science which he called the\r\nPhysical Geography of the Seas. The first edition, published early\r\nin the year 1855, contained only 274 pages, and was dedicated “as a\r\ntoken of friendship and a tribute to worth” to George Manning of New\r\nYork who had been of great assistance to Maury in the distribution of\r\nthe wind and current charts. In 1861, the eighth and last American\r\nedition of 474 pages appeared, and at about the same time an English\r\nedition was published by Sampson Low, Son and Company in London. This\r\nAmerican edition was dedicated to William C. Hasbrouck of Newburgh,\r\nNew York “as a token of the friendship and esteem, from boyhood till\r\nnow, of his former pupil”; while the English edition was inscribed\r\nto Lord Wrottesley. The book ran to as many as nineteen editions in\r\nEngland, where it bore the somewhat fuller title of “Physical Geography\r\nof the Sea and Its Meteorology”. It has been translated into Dutch,\r\nGerman, French, Italian, Spanish, and Norwegian, and has been used as a\r\ntextbook in several naval schools on the Continent.\r\n\r\nAs to the contents and general scope of his book, Maury wrote in\r\nthe introduction, “Under this term will be included a philosophical\r\naccount of the winds and currents of the sea; of the circulation of\r\nthe atmosphere and ocean; of the temperature and depth of the sea; of\r\nthe wonders that are hidden in its depths; and of the phenomena that\r\ndisplay themselves at its surface. In short, I shall treat of the\r\neconomy of the sea and its adaptations—of its salts, its waters, its\r\nclimates, and its inhabitants, and of whatever there may be of general\r\ninterest in its commercial uses or industrial pursuits, for all such\r\nthings pertain to its Physical Geography”. It contained also a number\r\nof illustrative plates, among which was the first bathymetric map ever\r\nmade of the North Atlantic Ocean, with contour-lines drawn in at 1000,\r\n2000, 3000, and 4000 fathoms.\r\n\r\nSome idea of the nature of the book and of Maury’s peculiar style can\r\nbe best secured by the consideration of some selections taken from\r\nit here and there. Those quoted below are, of course, of the nature\r\nof “purple patches”, for it must not be supposed that there are no\r\ndry and uninteresting passages in the book; but they are fairly\r\nrepresentative and will probably serve the purpose intended. Maury was\r\nthe first scientist to make a careful study of the Gulf Stream, and\r\nthe first chapter of his “Physical Geography of the Sea” is devoted\r\nto this mighty ocean current. The reader’s interest is gained and\r\nhis imagination is excited at once by these opening sentences: “There\r\nis a river in the ocean. In the severest droughts it never fails, and\r\nin the mightiest floods it never overflows. Its banks and its bottom\r\nare of cold water, while its current is of warm. The Gulf of Mexico\r\nis its fountain, and its mouth is in the Arctic Seas. It is the Gulf\r\nStream. There is in the world no other such majestic flow of waters.\r\nIts current is more rapid than the Mississippi or the Amazon, and its\r\nvolume more than a thousand times greater”.\r\n\r\nIn the chapter on the “Influence of the Gulf Stream upon Climates” is\r\nthe following striking passage on whales and other animals of the sea:\r\n“Now, the Western Islands is the great place of resort for whales: and\r\nat first there is something curious to us in the idea that the Gulf\r\nof Mexico is the harvest-field, and the Gulf Stream the gleaner which\r\ncollects the fruitage planted there, and conveys it thousands of miles\r\noff to the hungry whale at sea. But how perfectly in unison is it with\r\nthe kind and providential care of that great and good Being which feeds\r\nthe young ravens when they cry, and caters for the sparrow....\r\n\r\n“The inhabitants of the ocean are as much the creatures of climate as\r\nare those of the dry land; for the same Almighty hand, which decked\r\nthe lily and cares for the sparrow, fashioned also the pearl and feeds\r\nthe great whale, and adapted each to the physical conditions by which\r\nHis providence has surrounded it. Whether of the land or the sea, the\r\ninhabitants are all His creatures, subjects of His laws, and agents of\r\nHis economy. The sea, therefore, we may safely infer, has its offices\r\nand duties to perform; so, may we infer, have its currents, and so,\r\ntoo, its inhabitants; consequently, he who undertakes to study its\r\nphenomena must cease to regard it as a waste of waters. He must look\r\nupon it as a part of that exquisite machinery by which the harmonies\r\nof nature are preserved, and then he will begin to perceive the\r\ndevelopments of order and the evidences of design; these make it a most\r\nbeautiful and interesting subject for contemplation”.\r\n\r\nThis idea of divine order and design occurs again and again in the book\r\nlike the motive in a piece of music; in fact, Maury, though he did not\r\nformally enter the church until late in life, was a very religious\r\nman and well read in the Bible, quotations from which appear in his\r\nwritings by the dozen. He had very definite ideas about the relation\r\nbetween science and the Bible, and declared that it was his rule never\r\nto forget who was the Author of the great volume which Nature spreads\r\nout before men, and always to remember that the same Being was the\r\nauthor of the book which revelation holds forth for contemplation. It\r\nwas his opinion that, though the works were entirely different, their\r\nrecords were equally true, and that when they bear upon the same point,\r\nas they occasionally do, it would be impossible for them to contradict\r\neach other. If the two cannot be reconciled, the fault therefore is in\r\nman’s weakness and blindness in interpreting them aright.\r\n\r\nTo return to the “Physical Geography of the Sea”, the chapter on the\r\natmosphere contains many noteworthy passages such as the following:\r\n“... The atmosphere is something more than a shoreless ocean, at the\r\nbottom of which he (man) creeps along. It is an envelope or covering\r\nfor the dispersion of light and heat over the surface of the earth;\r\nit is a sewer into which, with every breath we draw, we cast vast\r\nquantities of dead animal matter; it is a laboratory for purification,\r\nin which that matter is recompounded, and wrought again into wholesome\r\nand healthful shapes; it is a machine for pumping up all the rivers\r\nfrom the sea, and conveying the waters from their fountains on the\r\nocean to their sources in the mountains; it is an inexhaustible\r\nmagazine, marvellously adapted for many benign and beneficent\r\npurposes.... To evaporate water enough annually from the ocean to cover\r\nthe earth, on the average, five feet with rain; to transport it from\r\none zone to another; and to precipitate it in the right places, at\r\nsuitable times, and in the proportions due, is one of the offices of\r\nthe grand atmospheric machine. This water is evaporated principally\r\nfrom the torrid zone. Supposing it all to come thence, we shall have,\r\nencircling the earth, a belt of ocean three thousand miles in breadth,\r\nfrom which this atmosphere evaporates a layer of water annually sixteen\r\nfeet in depth. And to hoist up as high as the clouds, and lower again\r\nall the water in a lake sixteen feet deep, and three thousand miles\r\nbroad, and twenty-four thousand long, is the yearly business of this\r\ninvisible machinery. What a powerful engine is the atmosphere! and how\r\nnicely adjusted must be all the cogs, and wheels, and springs, and\r\n_compensations_ of this exquisite piece of machinery, that it never\r\nwears out nor breaks down, nor fails to do its work at the right time,\r\nand in the right way”.\r\n\r\nOne other selection, from the chapter on “The Salts of the Sea”, will\r\nbe sufficient as illustrative material. “Take for example”, he writes,\r\n“the coral islands, reefs, beds, and atolls, with which the Pacific\r\nOcean is studded and garnished. They were built up of materials which\r\na certain kind of insect quarried from the sea water. The currents of\r\nthe sea ministered to this little insect—they were its _hod carriers_.\r\nWhen fresh supplies of solid matter were wanted for the coral rock upon\r\nwhich the foundations of the Polynesian Islands were laid, those hod\r\ncarriers brought them in unfailing streams of sea water, loaded with\r\nfood and building materials for the coralline. The obedient currents\r\nthread the widest and deepest seas. They never fail to come at the\r\nright time, nor refuse to go; for, unless the currents of the sea\r\nwere employed to carry off from this insect the waters that have been\r\nemptied by it of their lime, and to bring to it others charged with\r\nmore, it is evident the little creature would have perished for want\r\nof food long before its task was half completed. But for currents, it\r\nwould have been impaled in a nook of the very drop of water in which\r\nit was spawned; for it would soon have secreted the lime contained in\r\nthis drop of water, and then, without the ministering aid of currents\r\nto bring it more, it would have perished for the want of food for\r\nitself and materials for its edifice; and thus, but for the benign\r\ncurrents which took this exhausted water away, there we perceive this\r\nemptied drop would have remained, not only as the grave of the little\r\narchitect, but as a monument in attestation of the shocking monstrosity\r\nthat there had been a failure in the sublime system of terrestrial\r\nadaptations—that the sea had not been adapted by its Creator to the\r\nwell-being of all its inhabitants. Now we do know that its adaptations\r\nare suited to all the wants of every one of its inhabitants—to the\r\nwants of the coral insect as well as to those of the whale. Hence\r\nwe say _we know_ that the sea has its system of circulation, for it\r\ntransports materials for the coral rock from one part of the world to\r\nanother; its currents receive them from the rivers, and hand them over\r\nto the little mason for the structure of the most stupendous works of\r\nsolid masonry that man has ever seen—the coral islands of the sea”.\r\n\r\nThe contemporary reviews of Maury’s “Physical Geography of the Sea”\r\ngave unqualified praise to his style. The _Revue des Deux Mondes_\r\ndeclared, “Often indeed his powerful imagination makes of Maury a\r\nveritable poet, and his descriptions recall involuntarily those\r\nstories of the ‘Thousand and One Nights’, which charmed our childhood,\r\nwhere Gulnare pictures for her husband marvellously the mysterious\r\nrealms of the profundities under the sea”. Humboldt considered it\r\nan epoch-making book, and the French scientist Jomard congratulated\r\nMaury upon the accomplishment of a “work so difficult, so useful,\r\nso laborious”, which he regarded as a true present to physicists,\r\ngeographers, and navigators as well as to the commerce of all nations.\r\nThe _Blackwood’s Edinburgh Magazine_ joined in the hymn of praise with\r\nthe opinion that “the good that Maury has done, in awakening the powers\r\nof observation of the officers of the Royal and mercantile navies of\r\nEngland and America is incalculable”, and added that such researches\r\nwere exercising the most beneficial effect in improving and elevating\r\nthe minds of seamen everywhere.\r\n\r\nSome of Maury’s theories, however, were early questioned, especially\r\nthe one regarding the causes of ocean currents such as the Gulf Stream.\r\nHe contended that they were set in motion by differences in specific\r\ngravity of the water in different places as caused by a disparity in\r\ntemperature or in saltness. Sir John Herschel had considered that the\r\ncurrents were due entirely to the Trade Winds; and C. Wyville Thomson,\r\nwho thought that Maury’s theory was ambiguous, was an adherent to the\r\nHerschel theory, though his colleague Carpenter was of a different\r\nopinion still. “It is now known, however,” writes Sir Willam A.\r\nHerdman,[7] “that the Gulf Stream is not an independent phenomenon, but\r\nis a part of the general system of surface circulation of the ocean,\r\na system in which the currents, diverted to the east, as a result of\r\nthe rotation of the earth in their course northwards from the equator,\r\nflow clockwise in the North Atlantic around a central, relatively calm\r\narea, the Sargasso Sea, in which seaweeds and other floating objects\r\naccumulate”.\r\n\r\nWhen one considers how science develops, one theory changing or\r\ngiving place entirely to another as new and wider research is made,\r\nsuch criticisms as those above do not lessen at all the estimation of\r\nMaury’s greatness as a pioneer scientist in a comparatively new field\r\nof investigation, nor do they at all rob him of the right to be called\r\nthe world’s first great oceanographer. This is the opinion of a recent\r\nauthority on the science of the sea, who writes, “Marine meteorology\r\nmay be said to date from the time of M. F. Maury, U. S. Navy, whose\r\n‘Physical Geography of the Sea’, though out of date as to facts and\r\nsomewhat fantastic as to theories, remains a model book of popular\r\nscience, written by a man who was possessed of all the knowledge of his\r\ntime, and afire with the enthusiasm of research”.[8]\r\n\r\nMaury’s researches in oceanography led to his connection with one\r\nof the most romantic and far-reaching scientific achievements of the\r\ncentury, the laying of the first Atlantic telegraph cable. Mention\r\nhas already been made of the deep-sea soundings undertaken, under his\r\ndirection, by American naval officers during the years 1849–1853. With\r\nthe data furnished by these officers and by some others who were not\r\nengaged solely in sounding operations, Maury was enabled in the autumn\r\nof 1852 to construct an orographic map of the North Atlantic Ocean and\r\nto give a profile representing a vertical section of its bottom between\r\nAmerica and Europe near the parallel of 39° north latitude. This showed\r\nthe existence of what he called “the telegraphic plateau”.\r\n\r\nUp to this time no specimens of deep-sea ooze had been brought up\r\nfrom the bottom, and each sounding involved the loss of all the twine\r\nused as well as the cannon ball attached to it; and besides there was\r\nsome uncertainty each time as to whether the bottom had really been\r\nreached. Fortunately, Lieutenant John Mercer Brooke, who was then at\r\nthe Observatory, invented a simple but effective contrivance known\r\nas “Brooke’s deep-sea sounding apparatus”, which was well adapted to\r\nMaury’s needs. The instrument was used by Lieutenant Berryman in the\r\n_Dolphin_ during the year 1853 with great success, and the specimens\r\nwhich he obtained from the bottom were forwarded by Maury to Professor\r\nBailey of West Point, for examination under the microscope. Upon\r\nexamination the specimens were found not to contain a particle of sand\r\nor gravel mixed with them, but to be mites of sea-shells as perfect and\r\nunworn as when they were alive. This suggested to Maury the idea that\r\nthere were no abrading forces at play upon the bottom of the deep sea,\r\nand that, if an electric cord were ever laid down upon the telegraphic\r\nplateau, there it would remain without anything to chafe or wear it\r\nexcept alone the tooth of time.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, when in February, 1854 the projectors of the Atlantic\r\nTelegraph inquired of Maury as to the practicability of submerging the\r\ncable, he was able to reply as follows: “From Newfoundland to Ireland\r\nthe distance between the nearest points is about sixteen hundred miles,\r\nand the bottom of the sea between the two places is a plateau, which\r\nseems to have been placed there especially for the purpose of holding\r\nthe wires of a submarine telegraph and of keeping them out of harm’s\r\nway. It is neither too deep nor too shallow; yet it is so deep that\r\nthe wires, being once landed, will remain forever beyond the reach\r\nof vessels’ anchors, icebergs, and drift of any kind, and so shallow\r\nthat the wires may be readily lodged upon the bottom. The depth of\r\nthis plateau is quite regular, gradually increasing from the shores\r\nof Newfoundland to the depth of from fifteen hundred to two thousand\r\nfathoms as you approach the other side. Whether it be better to lead\r\nthe wires from Newfoundland or Labrador is not now the question; nor\r\ndo I pretend to consider the question as to the possibility of finding\r\na time calm enough, the sea smooth enough, a wire long enough, and a\r\nship big enough to carry and lay a coil of wire 1600 miles in length.\r\nI simply address myself at this time to the question in so far as the\r\nbottom of the sea is concerned; and as for that, the greatest practical\r\ndifficulty will, I apprehend, be found after reaching soundings at\r\neither end of the line, and not in the deep-sea. A wire laid across\r\nfrom either of the above-mentioned places on this side would pass to\r\nthe north of the Grand Banks and rest on that beautiful plateau to\r\nwhich I have alluded, and where the water of the sea appears to be as\r\nquiet and as completely at rest as it is at the bottom of a mill-pond.\r\nTherefore, so far as the bottom of the deep-sea between Newfoundland\r\nor the mouth of the St. Lawrence and Ireland is concerned, the\r\npracticability of a submarine telegraph across the Atlantic is proved”.\r\n\r\nMaury first began in November, 1853 to correspond with Cyrus W. Field,\r\none of the prime movers in the enterprise, and soon thereafter he\r\nmet him personally. In the following year, Field invited Maury to\r\nbecome financially connected with the submarine telegraph, but this\r\nwas declined on the grounds that he could not then be a disinterested\r\nadviser of the company. Field came to Maury often, sometimes every day\r\nfor weeks at a time, to consult as to the size and material for the\r\ncable, which according to Field’s first estimate was large enough,\r\nMaury playfully said, for the young whales to amuse themselves romping\r\nover it. Maury also devised a plan for making, coiling, and laying down\r\nthe cable; and when somewhat later Field wrote asking on behalf of the\r\ncompany in regard to the best route and time for laying it, Maury with\r\nthe help of his assistants consulted the results of 260,000 days of\r\nobservations at sea and replied that the most propitious time for their\r\nundertaking would be either the last of July or the first of August,\r\nand that the steamer with the western end of the telegraphic cord on\r\nboard would be less liable than the other to encounter a gale.\r\n\r\nField greatly appreciated Maury’s advice, and invited him and his\r\nwife and two daughters to go on an excursion in the summer of 1855\r\nto witness the laying of that part of the cable between Newfoundland\r\nand Cape Breton. He also gave permission that the National Observatory\r\nshould be the first to use the telegraph to determine longitude across\r\nthe Atlantic. In giving this assurance, Field wrote of the great help\r\nwhich Maury was rendering in “illuminating the path for the lightning”.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1856, Lieutenant Berryman in the _Arctic_ made soundings\r\nfrom St. Johns, Newfoundland to Queenstown, Ireland, both on the\r\noutward and homeward passages. But these soundings were very carelessly\r\nmade, and finally had to be declared worthless by Maury. In the\r\nsummer of the following year Lieutenant Dayman, Royal Navy went over\r\nthe same course in the _Cyclops_ and made satisfactory soundings,\r\nwhich confirmed Maury’s earlier statements as to the existence of the\r\ntelegraphic plateau.\r\n\r\nThe company met with many discouragements in the laying of the cable.\r\nAn unsuccessful attempt was made in the summer of 1857, and three\r\nother failures followed the next year. But perseverance finally\r\nhad its reward; the U. S. Steamer _Niagara_ and H. B. M. Steamer\r\n_Agamemnon_, after having met in mid-ocean and joined cables, set out\r\nfor opposite shores where they arrived at Trinity Bay and Valentia\r\nHarbor, respectively, about the fifth of August, 1858. There was great\r\nrejoicing on both sides of the Atlantic, and a great banquet was\r\ngiven in Field’s honor by the city of New York at the Metropolitan\r\nHotel on September 2, 1858. In his address on that occasion, Field\r\nreferred to the many to whom he was indebted and mentioned “those\r\nnever-to-be-forgotten philosophers Lieutenant Maury, Professor Morse,\r\nProfessor Faraday, Professor Bache, and Professor W. Thomson, who have\r\nrendered more efficient aid without receiving any compensation”.[9]\r\n\r\nIn October of the same year, the telegraph ceased to operate because\r\nof faulty insulation. It appears that the company had not carefully\r\nfollowed Maury’s advice as to the size of the cable, and he had not\r\nhimself been sanguine of success. After the failure, he contended\r\nthat all that was needed was a cable heavy enough to sink with its\r\nown weight, and that there was no need for the iron wire which was\r\nwound round the gutta-percha that would itself be impervious to decay,\r\nthat the strain of weight was all on the inner core of copper and had\r\nthus caused the trouble, that the iron wire on the outside might have\r\ninterfered with the electric current, and that one large conducting\r\nwire instead of the seven threads woven together would have been\r\nbetter. But he added that he had no doubt as to the ultimate success\r\nof a telegraph across the Atlantic. Because of the Civil War, however,\r\nthis was not to be accomplished until July, 1866; and as will be seen\r\nlater, circumstances were then such as to prevent Maury from having any\r\npart in the final successful culmination of the project to which he had\r\ngiven so much thought and valuable assistance.\r\n\r\nMaury’s researches in the science of the sea could not, perhaps,\r\nhave been so fruitful in practical achievements, had there not been\r\nat this time such a widespread desire to learn more about the ocean.\r\nIn America, it was a veritable age of geographical investigation and\r\ndiscovery. In addition to the Exploring Expedition under Wilkes,\r\nwhich spent three years and ten months in exploring the islands of the\r\nPacific and established the fact of the existence of the Antarctic\r\ncontinent, there were many others of the same nature. Lieutenant\r\nWilliam Francis Lynch, in 1847–1848, led an expedition which surveyed\r\nthe Dead Sea; in 1850–1851, Lieutenant Edward J. De Haven commanded a\r\nsquadron which went into the Arctic in search of Sir John Franklin,\r\nand though unsuccessful in finding the English explorer, he made\r\nimportant scientific discoveries; Commander Cadwalader Ringgold, during\r\n1853–1854, and then Commander John Rodgers, in the following years\r\n1855–1856, explored and surveyed Bering Strait, the North Pacific\r\nOcean, and the China Seas; and in 1853, Dr. Elisha K. Kane, U. S.\r\nNavy led another expedition into the Arctic regions in search of\r\nFranklin and off Greenland reached a stretch of water which he thought\r\nconfirmed Maury’s theory as to an open polar sea. Between 1848 and\r\n1852, Lieutenant John P. Gilliss conducted an astronomical expedition\r\nto Chile, Lieutenant Archibald McRae traversed the Pampas from Chile\r\nto Buenos Ayres, Lieutenant Isaac G. Strain explored the Isthmus of\r\nDarien, Lieutenant Richard L. Page investigated the La Plata and its\r\ntributaries, and Lieutenant William Lewis Herndon made his famous trip\r\nacross South America from the west coast to the headwaters of the\r\nAmazon and then down that stream to the Atlantic. Furthermore, it was\r\nat about this same time that Commodore Matthew Calbraith Perry went\r\nto Japan and by skillful diplomacy opened up that country to western\r\ncivilization.\r\n\r\nMaury simply reveled in the results of these various explorations,\r\nand his writings are filled with references to them. He knew all the\r\nexplorers personally, and furnished many of them with helpful advice\r\nand encouragement in their undertakings,—especially Kane, De Haven,\r\nLynch, and Herndon. Dr. Kane wished to name the open polar sea after\r\nMaury; but he waived the honor and wrote to Kane that he should yield\r\nto his friends and let “his name go upon the waters”, and to-day it is\r\nknown as Kane Basin.\r\n\r\nMaury’s investigations into the habits and nature of whales had led him\r\nto conclude that there was really a Northwest Passage as well as open\r\nwater about the North Pole. The former theory was proved by Commander\r\nMcClure of H. M. S. _Investigator_, July 31, 1850 to April 6, 1853,\r\nwhen he passed from west to east through the northern waters, and\r\nsettled the question. As to the polar sea, it is interesting to note in\r\npassing that only recently two explorers of the air, Byrd and Amundson,\r\nboth verified the truth of Maury’s theory.\r\n\r\nAs regards the Antarctic regions, Maury called upon the nations of\r\nthe world to coöperate in sending an expedition there. “Ho for the\r\nSouth Pole” was his slogan. “It is enough for me”, he wrote, “when\r\ncontemplating the vast extent of that unknown region, to know that\r\nit is a part of the surface of our planet, and to remember that _the\r\nearth was made for man_; that all knowledge is profitable; that no\r\ndiscoveries have conferred more honor and glory upon the age in which\r\nthey were made, or been more beneficial to the world than geographical\r\ndiscoveries; and that never were nations so well prepared to undertake\r\nAntarctic exploration as are those that I now solicit”. Though the\r\nCivil War interfered with the carrying out of plans for the exploring\r\nof that portion of the globe, yet Maury’s name deserves to be\r\nremembered among those whose continued interest in this enterprise\r\nfinally led to the conquering of the South Pole.\r\n\r\nAnother contribution which Maury made was the laying down of lanes for\r\nsteamers in the North Atlantic. The idea originated with R. B. Forbes\r\nof Boston, but was worked out scientifically by Maury. In the year\r\n1855, at the instigation of a board of underwriters of New York, who\r\npaid for its cost, he published a chart illustrating what he called\r\nOcean Lanes. To prepare this chart he studied the logs of 46,000 days\r\nof observations of the wind and weather of that part of the North\r\nAtlantic. Two tracks, or lanes, twenty miles wide, were laid down, to\r\nthe more northern of which he proposed to confine the steamers westward\r\nbound, while the eastward bound vessels were to use the other, situated\r\nfrom one to ten degrees further south. Although the Secretary of the\r\nNavy immediately ordered the ships of the navy to observe these lanes,\r\nthey were not generally adopted by the shipping of the world until\r\nabout thirty-six years after they were formulated, and it was not until\r\n1898 that all of the transatlantic steamship companies consented in a\r\nwritten agreement to use them. After a dispassionate investigation of\r\nthe lanes, they said that they were impressed with the patience and\r\nresearches that Maury must have made to have laid down such excellent\r\npaths, and they recognized that, had the highways been followed\r\nearlier, the great majority of the accidents which had befallen vessels\r\nin the North Atlantic might have been avoided.\r\n\r\nMaury, then, was not merely a theorizer without the power of applying\r\nhis ideas to the practical needs of men. His greatness consisted\r\nin his being a man of vision and imagination, and at the same time\r\na man of tremendous industry who was willing to toil endlessly that\r\nhis theories might be made practical realities. This aim of unselfish\r\nservice to humanity was displayed in all his researches in the science\r\nof the sea, from which came the works upon which his claim to fame\r\nchiefly rests. These were “The Wind and Current Charts”, “Sailing\r\nDirections”, and “The Physical Geography of the Sea”. That such a\r\nclaim is no idle one is borne out by the works themselves as well as\r\nby their influence upon all succeeding marine research, and it was the\r\nrealization of this fact that led the Secretary of the Navy recently to\r\ngive to the oceanographic research now being planned the name “Maury\r\nUnited States Naval Oceanographic Research”.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n  _Courtesy of “The Journal of American History,” Vol. IV, Number 3\r\n  (1910)._\r\n\r\n  SET OF SILVER MEDALS PRESENTED TO MAURY BY POPE PIUS IX\r\n\r\n  See page 65]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n  _Courtesy of “The Journal of American History,” Vol. IV, Number 3\r\n  (1910)._\r\n\r\n  MEDALS BESTOWED UPON MAURY\r\n\r\n  Gold medals bestowed upon Maury by the rulers of Sweden, Prussia,\r\n  Holland, Austria, Sardinia, and France, the Republic of Bremen, and\r\n  the Paris Universal Exhibition of 1855.

Before going\r\nforward with the story of his life, it would be well, therefore, to\r\npause and consider some of these extra-professional activities that he\r\nwas interested in.\r\n\r\nMaury’s interest in land meteorology had some connection, indeed, with\r\nhis particular field of research; and in the beginning this was a part\r\nof his plan for a universal system of meteorological observations. But\r\nthe opposition of Great Britain led him to withdraw it from the program\r\nof matters to be considered at the Brussels Conference, under the\r\nimpression that a half of a loaf was better than no loaf at all. Upon\r\nhis return to America after the conference, he began almost immediately\r\nto advocate the calling of another conference to consider land\r\nmeteorology. As to the connection between the meteorology of the land\r\nand the sea he wrote in his “Sailing Directions” of 1855, “The great\r\natmospherical ocean, at the bottom of which we are creeping along, and\r\nthe laws of which touch so nearly the well-being of the whole human\r\nfamily, embraces the land as well as the sea, and neither those laws\r\nnor the movement and phenomena of the atmosphere can be properly\r\nstudied or thoroughly investigated until observations, both by land and\r\nsea, shall enable us to treat the atmosphere as a whole”.\r\n\r\nThe lukewarmness of Great Britain toward such a conference, and the\r\nCrimean War into which both that country and France entered, interfered\r\nwith its meeting. But Maury continued to advocate a universal system\r\nof meteorological observations for the United States. He declared\r\nthat it would cost no more to extend the system to the land than it\r\nhad cost to spread it over the sea, and that, should it at any time\r\nbe judged expedient so to enlarge the field of his researches as to\r\ninclude agriculture as well as commercial meteorology, he was ready\r\nat the bidding of the Department to submit a detailed plan for its\r\nconsideration. The first fruits of his system of observations, which\r\nwould be reported daily by telegraph and announced in the newspapers,\r\nwould be, he said, that the farmers, merchants, and public in general\r\nwould know with something like certainty the kind of weather to be\r\nexpected, one, two, or more days in advance.\r\n\r\nMaury addressed the United States Agricultural Society on the subject\r\nin Washington on January 10, 1856; and the question having been carried\r\nto the Agricultural Committee of the Senate, a bill was drawn in April\r\nto appropriate $20,000 to establish a system of daily observations. In\r\nJune, Maury thought that Congress was disposed to enlarge on the idea\r\nand establish an Agricultural Bureau, but in August he wrote sadly that\r\npolitical events of a different nature had turned public attention\r\naway from meteorology and the advancement of science and directed the\r\nlegislation of Congress to other subjects.\r\n\r\nThe bill was still pending, however, in the Senate early in 1857,\r\nand the details of Maury’s plan were presented in Senator Harlan’s\r\nreport, made on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture. The following\r\nextract from this report will indicate to what extent those who\r\nafterwards established the United States Weather Bureau were indebted\r\nto Maury’s plan: “It is believed that the Superintendent of the\r\nObservatory can obtain the necessary coöperation to enable him to\r\nsubject the atmosphere to this system of research by an appeal to the\r\nfarmers similar to that made to the mariners, if the Government will\r\nfurnish appropriate instruments and defray the expense of transmitting\r\nthis intelligence to the Hydrographical Office. In order that these\r\nobservations might be reliable, the instruments with which they are\r\nto be made must be correct. An appropriation of a small sum of money\r\nwould be necessary for the purchase of a few standard sets, to be\r\ndistributed among the states and territories, for use and comparison,\r\nunder suitable regulation to be prescribed by the Secretary of the\r\nNavy. It would be highly desirable, also, to be able to receive from\r\nall parts of the country daily reports by telegraph. In this way,\r\nthe condition of the atmosphere in every part of the country, the\r\npresence of a storm in any quarter, its direction, its force, and the\r\nrapidity of its march could be known at every point any hour of the\r\nday; simultaneous reports from the various stations of the character of\r\nthe weather, being received and combined at the central office, could\r\nnot fail to afford results of the highest interest and advantage to\r\nevery industrial pursuit. Storms, having their origin in one part of\r\nthe world and taking up their line of march for another, may be thus\r\nnarrowly watched by the mariner in communication with the land, in\r\nmany instances for days before they would reach his shipping. Being\r\nforewarned, he could adopt the necessary means to evade their fury. The\r\nsame intelligence thus communicated to the farmer and out-door laborer\r\nwould be equally useful in its results. Every intelligent farmer, who\r\nis willing to note his observations, would become a sentinel on the\r\nwatch-tower to admonish his fellow-laborers in the fields, as well as\r\nhis co-laborers on the sea engaged in carrying his produce to distant\r\nmarkets, of approaching foul weather and consequent danger; and it is\r\nconfidently maintained by those whose opinions are entitled to the\r\ngreatest weight that with such a system of observation the laws that\r\ngovern the course of those storms would soon be so well known that, in\r\nmost cases, shipmasters and out-door laborers could be forewarned of\r\ntheir approach. Lieutenant Maury has also suggested that by mapping\r\nthe skies, for example, of the United States, and adopting a system of\r\nsigns and symbols, these telegraphic observations may be so projected\r\non this map as to convey to the observer at a glance a knowledge of\r\nthe appearance of the sky all over the whole country any hour in the\r\nday; and that by this means the change of the appearance of the sky,\r\nand subsequent changes of weather all over a continent, may be seen and\r\nstudied from day to day; from which it is believed that science would\r\ndeduce results of the highest importance.... It has been suggested by\r\nLieutenant Maury, and approved by your memorialists that the number\r\nof observers may be multiplied indefinitely by inviting the farmers,\r\nlike the mariners at sea, to make voluntary observations of the\r\nweather, crops, soil, and flora, and report regularly to a common\r\nsuperintendent, by whom they also shall be discussed and classified”.\r\n\r\nThis bill failed to become a law, and Maury’s ambitious but reasonable\r\nplan for a system of land meteorology came to grief. The defeat\r\nof the measure was brought about largely through the opposition\r\nof Professor Henry, Secretary of the Smithsonian Institute, who\r\nconsidered that Maury’s plan would be a rival to that proposed by him\r\nfor the Smithsonian. Maury bitterly regretted this opposition, and\r\nin an address delivered in October, 1859 before the North Alabama\r\nAgricultural and Mechanical Association at Decatur he said, “Some years\r\nago I proposed, you recollect, a system of agricultural meteorology\r\nfor farmers, and of daily weather reports by telegraph from all parts\r\nof the country for the benefit of mankind. The Smithsonian Institution\r\nand the Agricultural Bureau of the Patent Office stole this idea and\r\nattempted to carry it out, but with what success let silence tell. Take\r\nnotice now that this plan of crop reports is ‘my thunder’, and if you\r\nsee some one in Washington running away with it there, recollect if you\r\nplease where the lightning came from”.\r\n\r\nMaury continued to agitate this question by both letters and public\r\naddresses particularly among the people of the Great Lakes region and\r\nof the South, until the outbreak of the Civil War. This put an end\r\nfor the time being to Maury’s attempts to establish a system of land\r\nmeteorology in the United States and to his endeavors to bring together\r\nanother international conference at which a scheme could be devised for\r\nmaking universal land and sea meteorological observations. But after\r\nthe war was over, he returned to the question, as will be noted later,\r\nwith his characteristic persistence and energy.\r\n\r\nIn 1848 Maury’s mind was intent on the shortening of communications\r\nby sea, and out of that problem grew his interest in the first\r\ntrans-continental railroad. His opinion at first was that the most\r\ndirect route to China would be by rail from Memphis to Monterey on the\r\nPacific, and thence by great circle sailing by way of the Fox Islands\r\nwhich were convenient for coaling stations. He enthusiastically wrote\r\nthat, if there were a canal already cut from Chagres to Panama, the\r\ncircuity of the route and the loss of time compared with what was to\r\nbe gained by the proposed line from Memphis to Monterey would in time\r\ncause the abandonment of the former and the completion of the latter.\r\nMeanwhile the gold rush to California had begun, and Maury then decided\r\nthat both a railroad across the continent and a canal, or railroad,\r\nacross the Isthmus of Panama should be constructed. As president of the\r\nMemphis Convention of representatives from fourteen states, which met\r\nOctober 23, 1849, he urged both projects, and eventually each of the\r\ntwo routes was made available as a highway of transportation between\r\nthe East and the West.\r\n\r\nIn connection with Maury’s advocacy of the Isthmian route, there was a\r\nstory told by his nephew which throws light upon his uncle’s sterling\r\ncharacter. It appeared that some papers of his upon the advantages of\r\na route to the East by way of the Isthmus attracted much attention,\r\nand a Northern firm wrote him a letter, enclosing a check for $500\r\nin token of approbation of his views which strongly promoted the\r\ninterests of their business. He was asked to continue his advocacy of\r\nthat route, and was assured that the enclosure was but a mere earnest\r\nof what they would pay for his continued support. “Please to look at\r\nthis”, Maury said; “these people seem to think money the chief object\r\nof all endeavor”. He returned the check then with a courteous note of\r\nthanks explaining that he could not admit personal interest into his\r\ndiscussions of measures for the general good of the people.\r\n\r\nAnother question of great importance, to which Maury gave his voice\r\nand pen for many years, was the financial and maritime interests of\r\nthe South and West. As early as January, 1839, he wrote an article for\r\nthe _Southern Literary Messenger_ on “Direct Trade with the South”,\r\nin which he called upon the people of that section to establish a\r\nline of steam packets between Norfolk and Havre. In the year 1845,\r\nhe wrote for the same magazine his “Letters to Clay”, in which he\r\nadvocated the establishment of a dockyard, a school for apprentices,\r\nand a naval academy at Memphis, the construction of a canal from the\r\nupper Mississippi to the Lakes, the establishment of a naval base at\r\nPensacola as well as at some other point on the Atlantic coast south\r\nof Norfolk, and the placing of fortifications at Key West and the Dry\r\nTortugas for the protection of the Gulf. These measures he continued to\r\nadvocate in season and out of season.\r\n\r\nAfter Congress passed on June 15, 1844, an act for establishing a naval\r\ndockyard and depot at Memphis, Maury concentrated his batteries upon\r\nthe need for a canal to connect the Mississippi with Lake Michigan\r\nthrough the Illinois River. He claimed that this would be of great\r\nbenefit to commerce in time of peace, and that, if war with England\r\nshould come, the United States would then be prepared to meet her\r\nhalfway. “Let this work be completed”, he added, “and it will be a\r\ndragon’s tooth planted in the West to bring forth for the defense of\r\nthe country a harvest of steam-clad warriors, ever brave, always ready”.\r\n\r\nThis question he took up again at the meeting of the Memphis Convention\r\nof Southern and Western States, on November 12, 1845, where he was\r\nthe veritable spokesman of those two sections. Another important\r\nmatter which he advocated at this convention was what was called “A\r\nWarehousing System and Direct Trade with the South”. This, he said,\r\nwould foster shipping for Southern ports, enable ships to be loaded\r\nboth ways and thus make cheaper rates, and prevent trade in high-dutied\r\narticles from concentrating in New York where there was the greatest\r\namount of ready capital on hand. Other measures which Maury urged at\r\nthis convention were the following: bakeries at Chicago for supplying\r\nbetter bread for the navy, a school of engineers at Memphis, mail and\r\nsnag-boats as a nucleus for a river fleet in time of war, river marks\r\nor gauges as an aid to safer navigation, the deepening of the river\r\nbelow New Orleans at Southwest Pass, more lighthouses on the Florida\r\nand the Gulf Coast, and a monthly mail to Oregon.\r\n\r\nIn 1851, at the request of the Secretary of the Navy, Maury wrote a\r\nreport on “Fortifications” to be referred to the House Committee on\r\nMilitary Affairs. In this report he advocated for coast defense what\r\nhe called “a locomotive battery or flying artillery” to protect cities\r\nfrom the “Great Guns of Big Ships”; heavy fortifications at Key West,\r\non the Dry Tortugas, and perhaps on Ship and Cat Islands; and the\r\ncompletion of railroad connection with the Pacific and the beginning\r\nthere of the nucleus of a navy. He was opposed to floating batteries,\r\nbut favored twenty or twenty-five steam men-of-war as a home squadron\r\nand thought some provision should be made against surprise on the\r\nLakes. In closing, he declared, “The ocean front of the United States\r\nalone is greater in extent than the ocean front of the whole of Europe;\r\ntherefore, like action to the orator, a navy to us is the first,\r\nsecond, and third chief requisite to any effective system of national\r\ndefense”.\r\n\r\nThe same year Maury turned again to the “Commercial Prospects of the\r\nSouth”, which he made the subject of an address before the Virginia\r\nMercantile Convention at Richmond. In this he called attention to what\r\nmight have happened if Norfolk had become the terminus of a French\r\nline of steam packets to Havre, as he had suggested some dozen years\r\nbefore. Now, he said, the South must look toward the south; in view of\r\nthe importance of “our Mediterranean” into which big rivers flow that\r\nare the arteries of much commerce, and because of the potential riches\r\nof the Amazon which will be vastly increased by the construction of a\r\ncanal or railroad across the Isthmus, a line of steamers from Norfolk,\r\nCharleston, or Savannah to the mouth of the Amazon should at once be\r\nestablished. This enterprise, together with the need for building\r\nrailroads in the South, was constantly in Maury’s mind and often became\r\na subject of correspondence down to the beginning of the Civil War.\r\n\r\nMaury seems to have become almost as ready a speaker as he was a\r\nwriter, and as his fame grew he was frequently called upon to speak\r\non scientific questions and large problems of a commercial nature.\r\nIn 1846, he addressed the Philodemic Society at the commencement\r\nexercises of Georgetown College in Washington. In the course of his\r\nspeech he lauded the study of science in this fashion: “Beauties far\r\nmore lovely, poetry far more sublime, lessons inexpressibly more\r\neloquent and instructive than any which the classic lore of ancient\r\nGreece or Rome ever afforded are now to be seen and gathered in the\r\nwalks of science”. In 1855 he spoke to the Jefferson and Washington\r\nLiterary Societies of the University of Virginia, beginning with\r\nwhat he referred to as “sailing directions”. “There are some here”,\r\nhe declared, “who though not seamen are nevertheless about to become\r\nmasters of their own acts, and who are about to try the voyage of life\r\nupon a troubled sea. I have been some little time on that voyage;\r\nand it is so that, whenever I see a young man relying upon his own\r\nresources and setting out alone upon this long voyage, my heart warms\r\ntowards him. I always desire to range up alongside of him, to speak to\r\nhim kindly, and whisper words of encouragement in his ear”.\r\n\r\nThen he told the young men that they should have ambition to do even\r\nbetter than their fathers had done; that they should not lose sight of\r\nthe welfare of the community and the prosperity of the commonwealth;\r\nand that they should give Virginia again her place of leadership among\r\nthe states, and take away from the South the allegation that she is\r\nwanting in enterprise. He closed with the following rules of conduct:\r\n“Whatever may be the degree of success that I have met with in life, I\r\nattribute it, in a great measure, to the adoption of such rules. One\r\nwas never to let the mind be idle for want of useful occupation, but\r\nalways to have in reserve subjects of thought or study for the leisure\r\nmoments and quiet hours of the night. When you read a book, let it\r\nbe with the view to special information. The habits of mind to be\r\nthus attained are good, and the information useful. It is surprising\r\nhow difficult one who attempts this rule finds it at first to provide\r\nhimself with subjects for thought—to think of something that he does\r\nnot know. In our ignorance our horizon is very contracted: mists,\r\nclouds, and darkness hang upon it, and self fills almost the entire\r\nview around, above, and below to the utmost verge. But as we study the\r\nlaws of nature, and begin to understand about our own ignorance, we\r\nfind light breaking through, the horizon expanding, and self getting\r\nsmaller and smaller. It is like climbing a mountain: every fact or\r\nfresh discovery is a step upward with an enlargement of the view, until\r\nthe unknown and the mysterious become boundless—self infinitely small;\r\nand the conviction comes upon us with a mighty force that we know\r\nnothing—that human knowledge is only a longing desire.” In conclusion,\r\nhe warned them against believing that they had finished their education\r\non leaving the University, for they had merely cleared away the rubbish\r\nand prepared the foundations. If they ceased to study, they soon would\r\nforget what they had learned and mental retrogression would begin; for\r\njust as movement and progress were necessary aspects of life in the\r\nphysical world so were rest and decay correlative terms in the mental\r\nand moral realms.\r\n\r\nAmong the numerous addresses which he delivered during the decade\r\npreceding the Civil War, the most eloquent and significant was the one\r\ngiven on October 10, 1860, at the laying of the corner stone of the\r\nUniversity of the South at Sewanee, Tennessee. For this occasion there\r\nwere assembled eight bishops, two hundred presbyters, and five thousand\r\npeople. In introducing Maury, Bishop Otey, his old teacher and friend,\r\nreferred to him as a distinguished fellow-citizen, whose labors in the\r\ncause of science have crowned his name with honor throughout the world\r\nand made him, in a manner, the property of all the nations, for the\r\nwinds of Heaven and the waves of the sea had been made tributary by him\r\nto increasing the facilities of trade to every land and on every sea\r\nwhere commerce spreads her sails.\r\n\r\nMaury’s address, which is quoted in its entirety as an example of his\r\noratorical power, was as follows: “Ladies and Gentlemen: This greeting\r\nand the terms in which my old preceptor and early friend has brought me\r\ninto this presence fill me with emotions difficult to utter. I thank\r\nyou for your goodness.\r\n\r\n“Physical geography makes the whole world kin. Of all the departments\r\nin the domains of physical science, it is the most Christianizing.\r\nAstronomy is grand and sublime; but astronomy overpowers with its\r\ninfinities, overwhelms with its immensities. Physical geography charms\r\nwith its wonders, and delights with the benignity of its economy.\r\nAstronomy ignores the existence of man; physical geography confesses\r\nthat existence, and is based on the Biblical doctrine that the earth\r\nwas made for man. Upon no other theory can it be studied; upon no\r\nother theory can its phenomena be reconciled. The astronomer computes\r\nan ephemeris for his comets; predicts their return; tells the masses\r\nof the planets, and measures by figures the distance of the stars.\r\nBut whether stars, planets, or comets be peopled or not is in his\r\narguments, theories, and calculations of no consequence whatever. He\r\nregards the light and heat of the sun as emanations—forces to guide\r\nthe planets in their orbits, and light comets in their flight—nothing\r\nmore. But the physical geographer, when he warms himself by the coal\r\nfire in winter, or studies by the light of the gas burner at night,\r\nrecognizes in the light and heat which he then enjoys the identical\r\nlight and heat which ages ago came from the sun, and which with\r\nprovident care and hands benignant have been bottled away in the shape\r\nof a mineral and stored in the bowels of the earth for man’s use,\r\nthence to be taken at his convenience, and liberated at will for his\r\nmanifold purposes.\r\n\r\n“Here, in the schools which are soon to be opened, within the walls of\r\nthis institution which we are preparing to establish in this wood, and\r\nthe corner stone of which has just been laid, the masters of this newly\r\nordained science will teach our sons to regard some of the commonest\r\nthings as the most important agents in the physical economy of our\r\nplanet. They are also mighty ministers of the Creator. Take this water”\r\n(holding up a glassful) “and ask the student of physical geography to\r\nexplain a portion only of its multitudinous offices in helping to make\r\nthe earth fit for man’s habitation. He may recognize in it a drop of\r\nthe very same which watered the Garden of Eden when Adam was there.\r\nEscaping thence through the veins of the earth into the rivers, it\r\nreached the sea; passing along its channels of circulation, it was\r\nconveyed far away by its currents to those springs in the ocean which\r\nfeed the winds with vapor for rains among these mountains; taking up\r\nthe heat in these southern climes, where otherwise it would become\r\nexcessive, it bottles it away in its own little vesicles. These are\r\ninvisible; but rendering the heat latent and innocuous, they pass like\r\nsightless couriers of the air through their appointed channels, and\r\narrive here in the upper sky. This mountain draws the heat from them;\r\nthey are formed into clouds and condensed into rain, which, coming to\r\nthe earth, make it ‘soft with showers’, causing the trees of the field\r\nto clap their hands, the valleys to shout, and the mountains to sing.\r\nThus the earth is made to yield her increase, and the heart of man is\r\nglad.\r\n\r\n“Nor does the office of this cup of water in the physical economy end\r\nhere. It has brought heat from the sea in the southern hemisphere\r\nto be set free here for the regulation of our climates; it has\r\nministered to the green plants, and given meat and drink to man and\r\nbeast. It has now to cater among the rocks for the fish and insects\r\nof the sea. Eating away your mountains, it fills up the valleys, and\r\nthen, loaded with lime and salts of various minerals, it goes singing\r\nand dancing and leaping back to the sea, owning man by the way as a\r\ntask-master—turning mills, driving machinery, transporting merchandise\r\nfor him—and finally reaching the ocean. It there joins the currents to\r\nbe conveyed to its appointed place, which it never fails to reach in\r\ndue time, with food in due quantities for the inhabitants of the deep,\r\nand with materials of the right kind to be elaborated in the workshops\r\nof the sea into pearls, corals, and islands—all for man’s use.\r\n\r\n“Thus the right-minded student of this science is brought to recognize\r\nin the dewdrop the materials of which He who ‘walketh upon the wings\r\nof the wind’ maketh His chariot. He also discovers in the raindrop a\r\nclue by which the Christian philosopher may be conducted into the very\r\nchambers from which the hills are watered.\r\n\r\n“I have been blamed by men of science, both in this country and in\r\nEngland, for quoting the Bible in confirmation of the doctrines of\r\nphysical geography. The Bible, they say, was not written for scientific\r\npurposes, and is therefore of no authority in matters of science. I\r\nbeg pardon! The Bible _is_ authority for everything it touches. What\r\nwould you think of the historian who should refuse to consult the\r\nhistorical records of the Bible, because the Bible was not written for\r\nthe purposes of history? The Bible is true and science is true. The\r\nagents concerned in the physical economy of our planet are ministers of\r\nHis who made both it and the Bible. The records which He has chosen to\r\nmake through the agency of these ministers of His upon the crust of the\r\nearth are as true as the records which, by the hands of His prophets\r\nand servants, He has been pleased to make in the Book of Life. They are\r\nboth true; and when your men of science, with vain and hasty conceit,\r\nannounce the discovery of disagreement between them, rely upon it the\r\nfault is not with the Witness or His records, but with the ‘worm’ who\r\nessays to interpret evidence which he does not understand.\r\n\r\n“When I, a pioneer in one department of this beautiful science,\r\ndiscover the truths of revelation and the truths of science reflecting\r\nlight one upon the other and each sustaining the other, how can I, as\r\na truth-loving, knowledge-seeking man, fail to point out the beauty\r\nand to rejoice in its discovery? Reticence on such an occasion would\r\nbe sin, and were I to suppress the emotion with which such discoveries\r\nought to stir the soul, the waves of the sea would lift up their voice,\r\nand the very stones of the earth cry out against me. (Great applause.)\r\n\r\n“As a student of physical geography, I regard the earth, sea, air,\r\nand water, as parts of a machine, pieces of mechanism not made with\r\nhands, but to which nevertheless certain offices have been assigned\r\nin the terrestrial economy. It is good and profitable to seek to find\r\nout these offices, and point them out to our fellows; and when, after\r\npatient research, I am led to the discovery of any one of them, I\r\nfeel with the astronomer of old as though I had ‘thought one of God’s\r\nthoughts’—and tremble. Thus as we progress with our science we are\r\npermitted now and then to point out here and there in the physical\r\nmachinery of the earth a design of the Great Architect when He planned\r\nit all.\r\n\r\n“Take the little nautili. Where do the fragile creatures go? What\r\ndirecting hand guides them from sea to sea? What breeze fills the\r\nviolet sails of their frail little craft, and by whose skill is it\r\nenabled to brave the sea and defy the fury of the gale? What mysterious\r\ncompass directs the flotilla of these delicate and graceful argonauts?\r\nComing down from the Indian Ocean, and arriving off the stormy cape,\r\nthey separate—the one part steering for the Pacific, the other for\r\nthe Atlantic Ocean. Soon the ephemeral life that animates these tiny\r\nnavigators will be extinct; but the same power which cared for them\r\nin life now guides them in death, for though dead their task in the\r\nphysical economy of our planet is not finished, nor have they ceased to\r\nafford instruction in philosophy. The frail shell is now to be drawn to\r\ndistant seas by the lower currents. Like the leaf carried through the\r\nair by the wind, the lifeless remains descend from depth to depth by an\r\ninsensible fall even to the appointed burial place on the bottom of the\r\ndeep; there to be collected into heaps and gathered into beds which\r\nat some day are to appear above the surface a storehouse rich with\r\nfertilizing ingredients for man’s use. Some day science will sound the\r\ndepth to which this dead shell has fallen, and the little creature will\r\nperhaps afford solution for a problem a long time unsolved; for it may\r\nbe the means of revealing the existence of the submarine currents that\r\nhave carried it off, and of enabling the physical geographer to trace\r\nout the secret paths of the sea. (Great applause).\r\n\r\n“Had I time, I might show how mountains, deserts, winds, and water,\r\nwhen treated by this beautiful science, all join in one universal\r\nharmony—for each one has its part to perform in the great concert of\r\nnature. (Renewed applause).\r\n\r\n“The Church, ere physical geography had yet attained to the dignity of\r\na science in our schools, and even before man had endowed it with a\r\nname, saw and appreciated its dignity,—the virtue of its chief agents.\r\nWhat have we heard chanted here in this grove by a thousand voices this\r\nmorning?—A song of praise, such as these hills have not heard since\r\nthe morning stars sang together:—the Benedicite of our Mother Church,\r\ninvoking the very agents whose workings and offices it is the business\r\nof the physical geographer to study and point out! In her services she\r\nteaches her children in their songs of praise to call upon certain\r\nphysical agents, _principals_, in this newly established department of\r\nhuman knowledge,—upon the waters above the firmament; upon showers\r\nand dew; wind, fire, and heat; winter and summer; frost and cold; ice\r\nand snow; night and day; light and darkness; lightning and clouds;\r\nmountains and hills; green things, trees, and plants; whales, and\r\nall things that move in the waters; fowls of the air, with beasts and\r\ncattle,—to bless, praise, and magnify the Lord. (Tremendous applause.)\r\n\r\n“To reveal to man the offices of these agents in making the earth his\r\nfit dwelling place is the object of physical geography. Said I not well\r\nthat of all the sciences physical geography is the most Christianizing\r\nin its influences?” (Long continued applause.)\r\n\r\nIn addition to his occasional speeches, Maury also appeared on the\r\nregular lecture platform, where he delivered three different series\r\nof lectures. “My lot in life”, he wrote, “is cast among those whose\r\nnecessities compel them to stop with philosophy now and then and ‘court\r\nDame Fortune’s golden smile’ until she vouchsafe a few extra centimes\r\nwith which one may propitiate butcher and baker. Yielding to these\r\nnecessities, I have occasionally to abandon the winds and the sea,\r\nand go digging in the hopes of finding a few of the ‘roots of evil’\r\nwherewith to propitiate amiable creditors. These necessities have\r\nbeen pressing upon me, so I had to abandon everything and go out on a\r\nlecturing tour”. In this connection, it is of interest to note that in\r\naddition to his salary of $3,500 as Superintendent of the Observatory\r\nMaury received from Harper’s as royalties on his “Physical Geography of\r\nthe Sea” from $300 to $400 a year up to the Civil War. He was also paid\r\nconsiderable sums for his contributions to the magazines, such as the\r\n_Southern Literary Messenger_, from which according to his account book\r\nhe received over $600 from November, 1841 to December, 1842. Maury had,\r\nhowever, a large family of eight children, and their needs increased\r\nfrom year to year.\r\n\r\nHis first series of regular lectures, six in number, was delivered\r\nbefore the Lowell Institute of Boston in December, 1856, on the general\r\nsubject of “The Winds and Currents of the Sea”. The Boston _Daily\r\nEvening Transcript_ reported the lectures and gave great praise to\r\n“Professor” Maury; while one who heard him wrote in a personal letter,\r\n“It was a truly interesting lecture and from our citizens there comes\r\nforth one response, _Excellent, Capital, The Lecture of the Season_.\r\nIt was no common audience, I assure you. Many were present who seldom\r\nattend evening lectures. All were enthusiastic in their praise. I was\r\ntold by men high in office and the estimation of the community that\r\nit was the best lecture and the most interesting to them that they\r\nhad ever heard. It was Lyceum night and the hour of commencement was\r\npostponed in order to give that audience a chance to hear, and they\r\ncame and heard; notwithstanding they had been sitting an hour to\r\nanother lecture, they sat still one and one-quarter hours more and so\r\nstill that throughout the whole one might have heard a pin drop”.\r\n\r\nFor these lectures Maury was paid the sum of $500; and on the same tour\r\nhe delivered ten other lectures in Massachusetts and New York at $50\r\na lecture. In New York he spoke at Albany, Rochester, Syracuse, and\r\nBuffalo. In the last-mentioned city two lectures were given on November\r\n27 and 28, and the account of the first of these in the Buffalo\r\n_Commercial Advertiser_ is most interesting. “We listened to Lieutenant\r\nMaury”, it reports, “with unalloyed pleasure. His appearance is that\r\nof a kind-hearted, benevolent man of fifty; his forehead that of a\r\nphilosopher, his eyes and lower face indicative of poetic sentiment.\r\nHis delivery is neither good nor bad, but he found no difficulty in\r\nenchaining the attention of his audience, and few, we presume, cared\r\nmuch for the lack of oratorical effect. We had never given Lieutenant\r\nMaury credit for the power of poetical description which he manifested\r\nin this lecture. Beautifully written, rich in descriptive power and\r\nfull of a sailor’s love for his ship, and his fondness for strange\r\nscenes, we have rarely listened to a better specimen of ‘word painting’\r\nthan that which referred to a western passage across the Pacific. But\r\nimmediately after came a description of the climate of Valparaiso,\r\nequally vivid, and in his allusion to the stars of the Southern\r\nhemisphere even more eloquent—one saw that night sky, a vault of\r\nsteel, the brilliant stars which shone upon its surface and the planets\r\nbrighter still, seemingly swimming in mid air beneath them; and the\r\nMagellan clouds, ‘rents in the azure robe of night, through which one\r\nlooked into the black profound of space beyond’”.\r\n\r\nOn his next lecture tour, during November and December, 1858, Maury was\r\ngone about a month; he traveled some five thousand miles and delivered\r\ntwenty-five lectures, at the following places: Rochester, Buffalo,\r\nCleveland, Ann Arbor, Chicago, Detroit, Kalamazoo, Indianapolis,\r\nLaporte, Cincinnati, Springfield, and St. Louis. The subjects that he\r\ndiscussed were: The Atlantic Telegraph, The Highways and Byways of the\r\nSea, On Extending to the Lakes a System of Meteorological Observations\r\nfor the Benefit of Lake Commerce and Navigation, On the Workshops and\r\nHarmonies of the Sea, and The Importance of a Careful Meteorological\r\nSurvey of the Great North American Lakes.\r\n\r\nThe various newspapers of these cities reported large and appreciative\r\naudiences, with many often turned away for lack of seats; and they\r\ninvariably praised the lectures. For example, the Indianapolis _Daily\r\nSentinel_ declared, “(The subject) was presented in such a pleasing and\r\nattractive form, and the facts, the experiments, and the analogies from\r\nwhich his conclusions were drawn were stated so clearly and clothed\r\nso beautifully that it seemed to the hearer rather like the fanciful\r\ndescription of the poet than the details of experimental philosophy”.\r\nThe Cleveland _Plain Dealer_ thus expressed its praise: “(His theme)\r\nwas treated with a mastery of facts, an array of historical data, and\r\na thoroughness and completeness of detail and all with a clearness,\r\nvigor, and force of language highly instructive and deeply and\r\npowerfully interesting. Without any of the graces of oratory, or the\r\nbeauties and effects of elocution, without even the charms of an\r\nagreeable delivery, Lieutenant Maury invested his subject with a degree\r\nof interest and power of attraction that was such as to challenge the\r\nadmiration and rivet the attention of his auditors from the opening to\r\nthe close”. The tour was evidently a great success, but the exposure to\r\nthe wintry storms so damaged Maury’s health as to bring on an attack of\r\nrheumatic gout on his return home, a disease from which he continued to\r\nsuffer off and on until his death fifteen years later.\r\n\r\nThe following autumn, however, he was lecturing again, this time\r\nin Alabama and Tennessee. While in Nashville to address the State\r\nAgricultural Bureau, he was invited by the Tennessee Historical Society\r\nto deliver in the Hall of the House of Representatives of the Capitol\r\nhis lecture on “The Geography of the Sea”. This was on October 12,\r\n1859, and on the following day Maury visited the House while in session\r\nand was welcomed by Speaker Whitthorne in the high-flown language\r\nwhich was popular at that day, as one who “has by his genius and his\r\ntalents made himself the peer of earth’s great men, and who by his\r\nwooing of the stars has made them to give forth speech and by his\r\ncontrol of the winds of the sea has compelled their obedience to man\r\nand made them to become ministers of his happiness”.\r\n\r\nAll of this speaking and writing made Maury’s name known very widely\r\nall over the United States, and it was but natural for some of his\r\nfriends to think of him in connection with the Presidency. They\r\nbelieved that, if his adopted state, Tennessee, would heartily nominate\r\nhim, not as a party man but as a broad-minded, public-spirited citizen,\r\nhe could be easily elected, for his popularity was great with all\r\nwho did not aspire to the leadership of some particular clique. But\r\nMaury did not like politics, and besides Fate had in store for him\r\nan entirely different future. However, in the light of his attitude\r\ntoward slavery and the preservation of the Union it is interesting to\r\nspeculate on how different the history of the United States might have\r\nbeen, had he been elevated to this high office.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MATTHEW FONTAINE MAURY\r\n\r\n  This painting, by E.

When it is\r\nremembered that his contacts with men were extremely numerous, and\r\nthat the opportunities for unpleasant controversy were almost without\r\nnumber in view of the fact that he was such an ardent advocate of\r\nwhatever question he took up, whether it was scientific, economic, or\r\npolitical, it is truly remarkable that there were so few who became\r\nhostile to him. But strange as it may seem, those who as a class\r\nwere most unfriendly to Maury and least sympathetic toward his work\r\nwere a considerable number of his brother officers in the navy. As a\r\nconsequence, in the year 1855, a board of naval officers inflicted upon\r\nhim painful mental sufferings and placed him in a humiliating position,\r\nat the very time when his name was being acclaimed by the scientists\r\nand many of the rulers of foreign countries.\r\n\r\nThe occasion for the display of this enmity against Maury was the\r\npassing of the Act of Congress of February 28, 1855, to “promote the\r\nefficiency of the navy”. To carry out this law, the President assembled\r\na board of naval officers consisting of five captains, five commanders,\r\nand five lieutenants, to “make a careful examination” of the personnel\r\nof the navy and report those found “incapable of performing promptly\r\nand efficiently all their duty both ashore and afloat”. Those so\r\nreported were to be either dropped from the rolls of the navy or\r\nplaced upon what was to be called the “reserved list” and receive\r\neither leave of absence pay or furlough pay, according to the degree\r\nof their disability; they were, moreover, to be ineligible for further\r\npromotion, and subject at all times to the Navy Department for duty.\r\n\r\nThe members of this board were Captains William B. Shubrick, Matthew\r\nC. Perry, Charles S. McCauley, C. K. Stribling, and Abraham Bigelow;\r\nCommanders G. J. Pendergrast, Franklin Buchanan, Samuel F. Du Pont, and\r\nAndrew H. Foote; and Lieutenants John S. Missroon, Richard L. Page,\r\nSylvanus W. Godon, William L. Maury, and James S. Biddle. The board\r\nmet on the 20th of June, and continued its sessions daily, except for\r\nSundays and the 4th of July, until it finished its work on July 25,\r\nand the following day it reported the results of its deliberations.\r\nIts judgment was that seventy-one officers should be placed on the\r\n“reserved on leave of absence pay” list, and eighty-one on the\r\n“reserved on furlough pay” list; while forty-nine were recommended to\r\nbe “dropped from the navy”.\r\n\r\nOfficial announcement of these results was not made until some weeks\r\nlater, and Maury did not receive notice from the Secretary of the Navy\r\nuntil September 17, 1855 that his name had been placed on the “reserved\r\non leave of absence pay” list. The Secretary’s letter, however,\r\ninformed him that he was not detached from the Naval Observatory, but\r\nwas to continue on his present duty.\r\n\r\nTo this letter Maury at once replied, “This announcement has taken me\r\nby surprise. I have been in the navy upwards of thirty years. During\r\nthis time I have aimed in every station to which I have been called to\r\nserve my country truly and well, with what success the Department and\r\nthe public can judge better than I. Suffice it to say, that I am not\r\naware that any charges or accusations or even any complaint of duty\r\nneglected or badly performed during this long period has ever reached\r\nthe Department against me. Nevertheless in the judgment of the Board\r\nI should be and have been placed under official disgrace. This is a\r\nsevere blow and I feel it as a grievous wrong. May I not therefore be\r\npermitted to know what is the accusation against me and who my accusers\r\nwere before the Board?” The Secretary answered that the Board in\r\naccordance with the law simply gave names and ranks, and did not assign\r\nreasons for its decisions.\r\n\r\nMaury felt that he had been made to suffer a grievous wrong, and\r\nbegan to appeal to his friends to help him to secure justice. He was\r\nparticularly incensed over the fact that the Board met in secret,\r\nand that he could find out neither what his offense was nor who his\r\naccusers were. Some of the members of this “monstrous inquisition”, he\r\ndeclared, had publicly condemned all science in the navy, and none of\r\nthe Board except Perry had made any mark upon the service that would be\r\nrecognized as a reminder of their excellence when they were gone. He\r\ncould think of only two reasons for their action against him. In the\r\nfirst place, there was a spirit of jealousy that he, a mere lieutenant,\r\nhad dared to establish a reputation somewhat honorable in spite of\r\nthem; and in the second place, they would attempt to offer as an excuse\r\nfor the slur they had cast upon him the fact that he was lame. As to\r\nthe latter reason, Maury wrote, “Mere bodily activity, in an officer of\r\nmy rank, is comparatively of little value, when taken in connection\r\nwith the mental activity. Officers are expected—at least, it is\r\ngenerally so in the upper grades—to work rather with the head than the\r\nhand, and, moreover, I am bodily as active as a majority of the Board,\r\nand if broken legs disqualify, at least one member of the Board should\r\nhave borne me company, for his leg was broken twice over.... General\r\nScott is crippled in the arm, yet it does not appear to have unfitted\r\nhim for the army. Besides, this Board has left untouched other crippled\r\nofficers, both above and below me”.\r\n\r\nThe action of the Board produced a very mischievous and demoralizing\r\neffect on the naval service, upon which it let loose the spirit of a\r\nhyena. Officers began to investigate the antecedents of each other,\r\nand all sorts of trouble-making scandal was unearthed. But fortunately\r\nfor Maury nothing could be found prejudicial against his character and\r\nhis record in the files of the Navy Department, and he exulted over\r\nthe fact that he had never tripped in his youth. He became disgusted\r\nwith all the accusations and insinuations that had been aroused, and\r\ndeclared that they were heart-sickening to a man who loved to live at\r\npeace with all the world.\r\n\r\nIt was necessary, however, for him to see the matter through. So he\r\nagain wrote to the Secretary of the Navy, complaining that he had\r\nbeen given no hearing, that all action had been taken in secret, no\r\nminutes or records of any kind having been kept, and that the charge\r\nof incompetency was too vague; and therefore he asked for specific\r\ncharges and for a fair and open trial according to law. The Secretary\r\nreplied that the members of the Board had dispersed to their duties;\r\nbut that he would reassemble them if the President so directed, adding\r\nthat Maury had a “spotless character and eminent service”. Another\r\ninterchange of letters took place, in which Maury said he could not\r\nsee the action of the Board otherwise than as official disgrace to\r\nhim; while the Secretary wrote that the President was of the opinion\r\nthat the Board acted in accordance with the law and that there was no\r\nauthority under it to command them to report the reasons for their\r\nrecommendations.\r\n\r\nMaury then decided to write a letter to each member of the Board and\r\nask the following questions: “1st. What was the process of examination\r\nadopted by the Board for ascertaining whether an officer was efficient\r\nor not? 2nd. What was the standing of efficiency for the grade of\r\nlieutenant? 3rd. What difference, if any, did the Board make between\r\nduty ashore and duty afloat? 4th. Wherein was I found incapable of\r\nperforming the duties of my office, rank, or grade? 5th. Did the Board\r\ninspect the Observatory, or make other examination as to the manner in\r\nwhich it is conducted? 6th. What was the character of the evidence upon\r\nwhich the Board pronounced its findings against me?”\r\n\r\nAll replies to these letters were unsatisfactorily evasive, but in\r\ngeneral they agreed in considering that Maury had not been placed in\r\nofficial disgrace. Perry wrote, “In justice to those who have been\r\naffected by the action of the Board, I cannot but hope that steps may\r\nsoon be taken by the proper authorities to develop the causes and\r\nexplain the circumstances which have brought about this painful change\r\nin our common service”. But the junior member, Biddle, wrote most\r\nfully, and gave the impression that he thought that the accident to\r\nMaury’s leg had unfitted him for sea service and that on this ground he\r\nhad voted for his retirement. He added that each officer should perform\r\nhis part of the most unpleasant duty in the navy, service afloat,\r\nand he implied that he believed Maury had been unwilling to go to sea\r\nbecause of “love of scientific distinction”.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the press of the country had taken up Maury’s cause, and\r\na few examples from the newspapers will show how high the feeling\r\nran. The _Scientific American_ wrote, “To use the language of the\r\nPhiladelphia _Inquirer_, we regard the action of the Board ‘as an\r\ninsult upon the virtue and general intelligence of the country’....\r\n(Maury’s) eminent services have been acknowledged by almost every\r\ngovernment in Europe. Prussia and Sweden have struck gold medals to his\r\nhonor. The Russian Ambassador has publicly thanked him by the direction\r\nof his government. England has not been sparing of her tribute of\r\nadmiration in Parliament, and has adopted his plans in her own navy,\r\nwhile the great French Industrial Exhibition awards to his charts her\r\nhighest premiums. His own country, on the contrary, declares him a clog\r\nand an incumbrance on its navy, and unworthy of promotion. We trust\r\nCongress will set this matter right. Better dispense with the services\r\nof the entire Board of ‘ten minutes inquisitors’ than of this eminent\r\nman. We understand that it had been proposed in Philadelphia, in case\r\nLieutenant Maury retired from the Observatory, to present him with a\r\ntestimonial of $50,000, as an acknowledgment of his services, and as\r\na mark of the disapprobation of the action of the Board. We doubt not\r\nthat this sum might easily be raised in our great commercial cities.\r\nYes, twice that if necessary”.\r\n\r\nThe New York _Herald_ held the Board up for ridicule, in the following\r\nfashion: “I understand there is now in press, and will shortly appear,\r\na history of the lives and eminent services of the late Retiring\r\nBoard, entitled ‘Lights and Shadows of the Fifteen’. It will embrace\r\nall the shades in the lives of those fifteen Spartans, from their\r\nentrance into the service up to their ‘Thermopylae defeat’ of 201\r\nbrothers in arms, by which gallant action they ‘promoted themselves’.\r\nIt will be the commencement of a new epoch in the naval history of the\r\ncountry, and will be rich, racy, and spicy”.\r\n\r\nFurther quotations from the New York _Journal of Commerce_, the\r\n_National Intelligencer_, and other newspapers might be given, in which\r\nthe contention was made that, without respect to party, the sentiment\r\nwas practically unanimous that Maury should be restored to his place\r\non the active list with all the “honor and reparation due to injured\r\nmerit”, and that this should be done without further delay. But two\r\nmore years were to pass before justice was done. Even after both the\r\nPresident and the Secretary of the Navy had come to realize that Maury\r\nhad been unjustly treated, there was considerable further delay while\r\nCongress formulated a plan for undoing the action of the Board in cases\r\nwhere mistakes had been made. Petitions had been presented by Senators\r\nfor about one hundred of the officers affected, and these occasioned\r\nendless debates in the halls of Congress during the year 1856. Senator\r\nBell of Tennessee presented the petition on Maury’s behalf before the\r\nSenate on January 21, 1856, and made several long speeches in its\r\ndefense.\r\n\r\nSenator Mallory of Florida, who had sponsored the bill for promoting\r\nefficiency in the navy, was naturally a strong defender of the action\r\nof the Board, and when Maury’s petition was presented he said, among\r\nother things, “If the Board has erred in any case whatever, there\r\nwas no error in the case of Lieutenant Maury”, for he declared that\r\nhis physical disability was sufficient cause and he had repeatedly\r\nshunned sea service. There seems to have been no personal animus in\r\nMallory’s stand, which appears to have been merely the defense of a\r\nparty measure; indeed, only one year before, when it was proposed in\r\nthe Senate to make a remuneration of $25,000 to Maury for the service\r\nto the country of his wind and current charts, Mallory as chairman\r\nof the Senate Committee on Naval Affairs made a long and favorable\r\nreport, in which he reviewed in detail Maury’s work and quoted words\r\nof praise from the reports of Secretaries of the Navy Graham, Kennedy,\r\nand Dobbin. His report concluded with these words: “This officer has\r\nbeen for years in the public service, has a family to provide for, and\r\nis entirely dependent upon his annual pay; and for these reasons your\r\nCommittee think that a sum of money, insignificant indeed in comparison\r\nto his services, yet sufficient to remove his anxieties and to cheer\r\nhis hopes for the future of those dependent upon him, might be justly\r\nbestowed. Your Committee recommend that a sum of 25,000 dollars be thus\r\nappropriated, and report a bill accordingly”. Such a sudden turn from\r\neloquent support of Maury to opposition to his interests was indeed\r\nremarkable, for it was a long jump from the advocacy of a measure\r\nawarding him $25,000 to one which reduced his salary from $3,500 to\r\n$1,200 a year. Mallory was supported in his defense of the action\r\nof the Board, as it affected Maury, mainly by Senators Clayton of\r\nDelaware, Benjamin of Louisiana, and Jefferson Davis of Mississippi.\r\n\r\nEventually, however, the Senate Committee on Naval Affairs reported\r\na bill to amend the act entitled “An Act to Promote the Efficiency\r\nof the Navy”, which was finally passed on January 16, 1857. This\r\nprovided that an officer whose status in the navy had been affected by\r\nthe action of the Retiring Board could by written request secure an\r\ninvestigation, by regular court of inquiry, into his “physical, mental,\r\nprofessional, and moral fitness” for the naval service, and that the\r\nfinding of this court might be submitted to the President, who was to\r\ntake action accordingly.\r\n\r\nThe bill originally contained two additional sections, providing for\r\nthe establishment of the rank of admiral and the organization of\r\na scientific corps in the navy; but they were finally struck out.\r\nThis scientific corps was to take charge of the Naval Observatory,\r\nthe nautical almanac, the hydrographical work, and such other\r\nscientific matters as the Secretary of the Navy should prescribe;\r\nand its personnel was to consist of one captain, two commanders, ten\r\nlieutenants, and seven masters. Mallory favored the establishment of\r\nsuch a plan, and, about-facing again, said on the floor of the Senate,\r\n“The Committee had an earnest desire that that distinguished officer\r\n(Maury) should be at the head of the corps”. Though Maury had written\r\nat first rather enthusiastically of the scientific corps, he eventually\r\ncame to the conclusion that it would not have been wise to establish\r\nit, and wrote that he was not sorry it had been struck out of the bill.\r\n\r\nUnder the main provisions of the amended act, Maury’s case was taken up\r\nby a court of inquiry, before whom it was proved by a surgeon that his\r\nleg was actually stronger than that of Missroon, one of the members of\r\nthe Board; that he had not tried to evade sea service but had applied\r\nfor such service during the Mexican War and had been refused; that\r\nother officers retained on the active list had a larger proportion of\r\nshore duty than he; and that he had been kept at the Naval Observatory\r\nby the various Secretaries of the Navy because of his special fitness\r\nfor the work. This latter statement was proved by personal letters, of\r\nwhich the following from William A. Graham will serve as an example:\r\n“In answer to your inquiry, why you were not ordered to sea during my\r\nconnection with the Navy Department, I have to state that I considered\r\nyour services at the National Observatory of far more importance and\r\nvalue to the country and the navy than any that could be rendered by an\r\nofficer of your grade at sea in time of peace. Indeed, I doubt whether\r\nthe triumphs of navigation and of the knowledge of the sea achieved\r\nunder your superintendence of the Observatory will not contribute as\r\nmuch to an effective Naval Service and to the national fame as the\r\nbrilliant trophies of our arms”.\r\n\r\nResolutions in favor of Maury’s restoration to the active service\r\nlist were passed by the state legislatures of Tennessee, Louisiana,\r\nAlabama, Maryland, New Jersey, Virginia, and New York. Of those passed\r\nby the last-mentioned state, he wrote, “These resolutions uttered\r\nby a great state in the manner of a free people have a charm that\r\nis lacking in these honors which, in the shape of medals, orders of\r\nknighthood, crosses, and decorations, have been conferred by the hands\r\nof strangers”.\r\n\r\nFinally, in view of the findings of the court of inquiry and the\r\nsympathy for Maury which had been aroused throughout the whole country,\r\nthe President not only restored him to the active service list but\r\nalso promoted him to the rank of commander. The announcement of this\r\npromotion was as follows: “Sir: The President of the United States,\r\nby and with the advice and consent of the Senate, has appointed you\r\na Commander in the Navy from the 14th of September, 1855, on the\r\nActive List. I have the pleasure to enclose herewith your commission,\r\ndated the 27th instant (January, 1858), the receipt of which you will\r\nacknowledge to the Department. I am respectfully, I. Toucey”. Thus was\r\nMaury at last completely vindicated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER IX\r\n\r\n                      SHADOWS OF COMING TROUBLES\r\n\r\n\r\nThough Maury emerged with victory perched upon his banners from his\r\nbitter conflict with the “Retiring Board”, yet he was not to enjoy\r\nagain the peaceful pursuit of scientific and philosophical researches.\r\nHis mind was to be distracted by the consideration of a question which\r\nwas before long to rend the country in twain and incidentally cause the\r\nwreck of his scientific ambitions.\r\n\r\nMaury had always been distinctively a sympathizer in all the hopes\r\nand ambitions of the South, but he had early recognized the dangerous\r\npolitical potentialities in the slavery problem. As far back as 1850\r\nhe had set forth the free navigation of the Amazon River as a novel\r\nremedy for the preservation of the Union. According to his plan, Brazil\r\nwas to become a country for the disposal of the surplus slaves of the\r\nSouth, and he hoped that in time by act of law slavery and involuntary\r\nservitude might be completely removed from the South. “The Southern\r\nstates”, he wrote, “may _emancipate_ just as New York, Massachusetts,\r\netc. emancipated their slaves—large numbers of them were not set free;\r\nthey, after the acts of prospective emancipation became laws, were\r\nsold at the South; and so the South may sell to the Amazon and so get\r\nclear of them. In no other way can I see a chance for it,—the slaves\r\nof the South are worth about fifteen hundred million. Their value is\r\nincreasing at the rate of thirty or forty million a year. It is the\r\nindustrial capital of the South. Did ever a people consent to sink so\r\nmuch industrial capital by emancipation or any other voluntary act?”\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n  _Courtesy of Dr. K. O. Bertling of the America-Institut of Berlin._\r\n\r\n  STATUE OF MAURY OVER THE MAIN ENTRANCE OF THE DEUTSCHE SEEWARTE\r\n  (METEOROLOGICAL STATION OF THE GERMAN ADMIRALTY) IN HAMBURG.]\r\n\r\nWith characteristic energy Maury pressed the question upon the notice\r\nof the public. Lieutenant Lewis Herndon’s report of his exploration\r\nof the Amazon Valley was submitted to Congress on January 26, 1853,\r\nand soon afterwards there appeared in the _National Intelligencer_\r\nand the _Union_ of Washington at irregular intervals seven articles\r\nsigned “Inca”, in which the commercial, mineral, and agricultural\r\npotentialities of the Amazon region were painted in glowing colors.\r\nThe free navigation of the Amazon River was demanded of Brazil by\r\nMaury in these “Inca” articles; and at the meeting of the Memphis\r\nConvention in June of the same year resolutions were adopted urging the\r\nsame proposition. These resolutions were then reported to the House\r\nof Representatives in the form of a “Memorial of Lieutenant Maury in\r\nbehalf of the Memphis Convention in favor of the free navigation of the\r\nAmazon River”.\r\n\r\nThis propaganda made at first a very unfavorable impression on the\r\nBrazilians, and caused them to suspect that a scheme of annexation by\r\nthe United States was the real reason for the insistence on the opening\r\nof their great river to free navigation. One Brazilian newspaper\r\nasserted that “this nation of pirates, like those of their race, wish\r\nto displace all the people of America who are not Anglo-Saxon”. So\r\nstrong was the feeling thus aroused that the House Committee on Foreign\r\nAffairs reported on February 23, 1855 that further action on the Maury\r\nmemorial was for the present inexpedient. However, at last, on December\r\n7, 1866, an agreement was signed providing that after September 7 of\r\nthe following year the Amazon should be free to the merchant ships of\r\nall nations, as far as the frontier of Brazil.\r\n\r\nLater even the Brazilians themselves conceded the beneficial influence\r\nof Maury in bringing this about. “After the publication in the _Correio\r\nMercantil_ of his (Maury’s) memorial”, wrote the Brazilian historian,\r\nJoaquim Nabuco,[10] “and his description of the Amazon region, locked\r\nup from the world by a policy more exclusive than Japan’s or Dr.\r\nFrancia’s, the cause of the freedom of navigation was triumphant.\r\nTavares Bastos himself received from the book by Maury the patriotic\r\nimpulse which converted him into a champion of this great cause”.\r\nEvents moved too swiftly, however, in the United States for the\r\ndevelopment of the Amazon Valley to play any part in the settling of\r\nthe slavery question.\r\n\r\nAlthough Maury was, to a certain degree, pro-slavery and a strong\r\nStates’ rights man, yet he was by no means dis-unionist. In fact,\r\nduring those critical months just preceding the outbreak of the War\r\nbetween the States he used all the power and influence at his command\r\nto keep the country united. As early as 1845 he referred in one of his\r\nletters to the “tendencies toward disunion in the nation”, and as the\r\nyears went by there was a constantly increasing number of references\r\nin his correspondence to the drifting of the ship of state toward the\r\nbreakers. In his opinions regarding the great question at issue, he\r\noccupied a position in the middle ground and refused to permit himself\r\nto be carried away by either the extremists at the North or those of\r\nthe South. He condemned with equal vigor the effort to precipitate\r\nthe acquisition of Cuba, and John Brown’s raid at Harper’s Ferry. He\r\nbelieved that the people as a whole, both of the North and of the\r\nSouth, were not in sympathy with such schemes, but that such raids and\r\nfilibustering expeditions were fostered by the unwisely partisan press,\r\npulpit, and politicians.\r\n\r\nHe, therefore, suggested the calling of a council of _men out of\r\npolitics_, ex-governors and old judges, from different states of the\r\nSouth to formulate some kind of a proposition to lay before the people\r\nof the North. “It will never do”, he wrote, “to suffer this Union\r\nto drift into dissolution”. With this end in view, he wrote to the\r\ngovernors of the border states, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Maryland, and\r\nDelaware, to act as mediators.\r\n\r\nHis letter to Governor Packer of Pennsylvania will give an idea of what\r\nhe hoped to accomplish. “When the affairs of a nation are disturbed”,\r\nhe declared, “quiet people, however humble their station, may be\r\njustified in stepping a little out of their usual way. In all exertions\r\nof duty, something is to be hazarded; and I am sure you have only time\r\nto hear what I wish to write—none to listen to apologies for venturing\r\nto write you this letter. You recollect that, in the nullification\r\ntimes of South Carolina, Virginia stepped forward as mediator, and sent\r\nher commissioners to that state with the happiest results. But we are\r\nnow in the midst of a crisis, more alarming to the peace and integrity\r\nof the Union than those memorable times. We have the people, in no\r\nless than seven of those states, assembling or preparing to assemble\r\nin their sovereign capacity to decide in the most solemn manner\r\nknown to them whether they will remain in the Union or no. The most\r\nremarkable feature in the whole case is, it appears to me, this—that\r\nhere we have a national family of states that have lived together in\r\nunity for nearly three score years and ten, and that a portion of them\r\nare preparing to dissolve these family ties and break up the Union,\r\nbecause—because of what, sir? Ask legislators, ask governors, ask whom\r\nyou will, and there are as many opinions as to the causes of discontent\r\nand the measures of redress as there are leaves in the forest. At no\r\ntime have the people of any of the discontented states, acting in\r\ntheir sovereign capacity, ever authorized a remonstrance to be made\r\nto their sister states of the North against their course of action.\r\nWe have heard a great deal of this from politicians, partisans, and\r\nothers, but if the people of any one of the Southern states, acting in\r\ntheir sovereign capacity, have ever remonstrated with the people of the\r\nNorthern states as to the causes of dissatisfaction and complaint, and\r\nthus laid the matter formally before you of the North, I cannot call\r\nit to mind. Neither has any Northern state so much as inquired of the\r\npeople of any Southern state, either as to the cause of their offense\r\nor as to the terms and conditions upon which they would be willing to\r\nremain in the Union.\r\n\r\n“It does appear to me that in and out of Congress we are all at sea\r\nwith the troubles that are upon us; that the people, and the people\r\nalone, are capable of extricating us. You, my dear sir, and your\r\nstate—not Congress—have it in your power to bring the people into\r\nthe ‘fair way’ of doing this. This brings me to the point of my\r\nletter—then why will not the great state of Pennsylvania step forth as\r\nmediator between the sections? Authorize your commissioner to pledge\r\nthe faith of his state that their ultimatum shall not only be laid\r\nbefore the people of the Keystone State, assembled likewise in their\r\nsovereign capacity, but that she will recommend it to her sister states\r\nof the North, for like action on their part, and so let the people, and\r\nnot the politicians, decide whether this Union is to be broken up”.\r\n\r\nNo tangible results, however, came from this effort, and Maury began\r\nto despair of the two sections’ being able to arrive at a peaceable\r\nsolution of the difficult problem. He had a clear conception of the\r\nnature of this fundamental question dividing the sections. “The\r\ndisease”, he wrote, “the root of the thing, is not in cotton or\r\nslavery, nor in the election of Lincoln. But it is deep down in the\r\nhuman heart. The real question is a question of Empire. And I do not\r\nthink our political doctors will be able to treat the case upon any\r\nother diagnosis than this. The country is divided into sections; it is\r\nimmaterial by what influence”.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Maury went about his work at the Observatory as well as he\r\ncould with his mind distracted by the unsettled state of the country.\r\nIn September, 1860, he made a visit with Mrs. Maury and other members\r\nof his family to Niagara Falls, and to Newburgh, New York to see the\r\nfamily of his old friend Hasbrouck. During the following month he\r\nwent to Tennessee to speak at the laying of the corner stone of the\r\nUniversity of the South at Sewanee, as has already been related. On\r\nthis visit, Maury went to Nashville, where he delivered two speeches.\r\nOne was to the school children on the subject of the sea; the other\r\nwas before the same audience that heard Robert L. Yancey and on the\r\nsame subject, the state of the country. Yancey urged war and made\r\nextravagant claims for success; but Maury counseled moderation and\r\nwarned the people that danger was ahead. In November, he was in\r\nEngland whence he had gone to arrange for the copyrighting of a new\r\nedition of his “Physical Geography of the Sea”.\r\n\r\nDuring that month momentous happenings occurred in the United States.\r\nOn November 6, Lincoln was elected President, and the day following\r\nthe legislature of South Carolina took steps which resulted in the\r\ncalling of a secession convention. This convention unanimously passed,\r\non December 20, an ordinance declaring the state of South Carolina no\r\nlonger in the Union.\r\n\r\nBy that time Maury had returned to the United States, and he made a\r\nlast effort to secure mediation through Commodore Stockton as the\r\nrepresentative of the Governor of New Jersey; but early in the year\r\n1861 he sorrowfully wrote that the New Jersey plan had missed fire.\r\nAfter the failure of this attempt he sought in vain to be made a member\r\nof the “Peace Congress”, which was called by the Border States and met\r\nin Washington in the month of February. In this he offered to represent\r\nTennessee, which he referred to as his Naomi.\r\n\r\nSouth Carolina had been followed out of the Union by Mississippi,\r\nFlorida, Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, and Texas. In February, the\r\nseceding states set up a provisional government with Montgomery as the\r\ncapital and with Jefferson Davis as President and Alexander H. Stephens\r\nas Vice President. But Maury urged the “barrier” states, Virginia,\r\nTennessee, and Kentucky, to remain in the Union in order to conserve\r\nthe peace, to mediate, and to organize a re-annexation party for the\r\nnext Presidential election.\r\n\r\nOn the day of Lincoln’s inauguration, Maury wrote, “The new President\r\nis now on his way to the Capitol, and the _Express_ reports ‘All\r\nquiet’, as I took it for granted it would be. I have no idea of any\r\ndisturbance, or any attempt even at a plot. Of course, you will see\r\nthe Inaugural as soon, if not sooner than I shall, for, having the\r\ntelegraph, Mr. Lincoln may literally speak his polyglot through tongues\r\nof fire. Officers of the Army and Navy—should war come between the\r\nsections—will have a hard time; and, indeed, who will not? No military\r\nman can permit himself to accept service with a mental reservation.\r\nAll who are foes of his flag, and whom his country considers enemies\r\nof hers, are enemies of his; therefore, if we have a war between the\r\nsections, every man who continues in ‘Uncle Sam’s’ service, is, in good\r\nfaith, bound to fight his own, if his own be on the other side. The\r\nline of duty, therefore, is to me clear—each one to follow his own\r\nstate, if his own state goes to war; if not, he may remain to help on\r\nthe work of reunion. If there be no war between the sections, we must\r\nhoist the flag of re-annexation, to carry the elections of ’64 upon\r\nthat issue, bring back the seceding states, and be happier and greater\r\nand more glorious than ever. As soon as the smoke clears away, you\r\nwill see that the old party lines have been rubbed out.... Virginia is\r\nnot at all ready to go out of this Union; and she is not going out for\r\nanything that is likely to occur short of coercion—such is my opinion”.\r\n\r\nBut the broken fragments of the Union were not to be reunited in any\r\nsuch peaceful fashion, and Maury was soon to be forced to follow his\r\nnative state into the bloody conflict. The overt act precipitating\r\nthe war was the firing on Fort Sumter, April 12, 1861. Maury thought\r\nthat the _Star of the West_ with recruits for the garrison of the\r\nfort should not have been sent, for it was but an invitation to South\r\nCarolina to an overt act which would still further widen the breach\r\nbetween the sections.\r\n\r\nIn any case, the overt act came, when under fear of reinforcements\r\nfrom a strong squadron which was in preparation President Jefferson\r\nDavis on April 12, 1861 ordered General Beauregard to reduce Fort\r\nSumter. Three days afterward President Lincoln issued a proclamation\r\ncalling on the state governors to furnish 75,000 state militia. This\r\ncaused Virginia to pass an ordinance of secession on the 17th of April.\r\nMoreover, in Tennessee, Maury’s adopted state, sentiment favorable to\r\nthe Confederacy began to crystallize, and on May 8 her legislature\r\ndecided also in favor of separation from the Union and leagued the\r\nstate with the Southern Confederacy. But in spite of the fact that\r\nMaury had written of Tennessee as his Naomi, it was his native Virginia\r\nthat decided his future for him.\r\n\r\nOn the day this state passed her ordinance of secession, Maury wrote\r\nto his wife, who was visiting in Fredericksburg, not to return to\r\nWashington, for he expected Virginia soon to declare herself out of the\r\nUnion and he would as a consequence immediately resign his commission\r\nin the navy. Three days later he regretfully forwarded to President\r\nLincoln his resignation from the service in which he had spent so many\r\nhappy and profitable years.\r\n\r\nThe circumstances connected with the writing of this resignation are\r\nthus related by Maury’s daughter Mary: “It is related of Socrates that,\r\nwhen his last hour had come and one of his young disciples brought him\r\nthe cup of hemlock, the young man covered his face with his mantle,\r\nweeping as he presented it, and, falling on his knees, he buried his\r\nface on the couch where his dear master sat awaiting his death. When\r\nMaury determined to leave the service of the United States, he bade his\r\nsecretary (Mr. Thomas Harrison) write his resignation. That true and\r\nloyal heart, which had served and loved him for almost twenty years,\r\nand whose fluent pen had rendered him such willing service, refused\r\nits office now; and, presenting the unfinished paper with one hand, he\r\ncovered his eyes with the other, and exclaimed, with a choking voice\r\nand gathering tears, ‘I cannot write it, sir!’ He knew it was the\r\ndeath-warrant to his scientific life—the cup of hemlock that would\r\nparalyze and kill him in his pursuit after the knowledge of nature and\r\nof nature’s laws”.\r\n\r\nAs far as the disturbed political conditions permitted, Maury continued\r\nhis work at the Observatory down to the very day of his resignation,\r\nhis last publications being Nautical Monographs, numbers 2 and 3,\r\non “The Barometer at Sea” and “The Southeast Trade Winds of the\r\nAtlantic” respectively. With the war clouds gathering round him he had\r\nwritten, “What a comfort the sea is! I have withdrawn my mind from the\r\nheart-sickening scenes that you gentlemen are meeting”. But with his\r\nleaving the Observatory this comfort was taken from him, and instead of\r\nthe quiet contemplative life of a scientist he was to suffer for eight\r\nyears the rough exigencies and trying uncertainties of the Civil War\r\nand its aftermath.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER X\r\n\r\n           AS HIS FRIENDS AND FAMILY KNEW HIM BEFORE THE WAR\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore passing on to a consideration of Maury’s connection with the\r\nevents of the Civil War, one should give some attention to him as he\r\nappeared to his friends and family during the _ante bellum_ decade\r\nwhen success, fame, and happiness were all his. Some idea of his\r\npersonality has, perhaps, already been conveyed through the discussion\r\nof his work and achievements up to this point in his career, though\r\nonly incidentally; now the aim will be to focus attention for awhile on\r\nMaury the man.\r\n\r\nThe range of his acquaintances was very extensive, and the list of his\r\ncorrespondents was largely the roll of the great men of his day. Among\r\nthese were the following, taken at random: John Quincy Adams, John C.\r\nCalhoun, John Tyler, Leverrier and other astronomers both at home and\r\nabroad, Humboldt, the Grand Duke Constantine of Russia, the Archduke\r\nFerdinand Maximilian of Austria, Jomard, the French Egyptologist, S. F.\r\nB. Morse, Cyrus W. Field, Professor Agassiz, Dr. Kane, Lord Wrottesley,\r\nLord Ashburton, Bishop Otey, Bishop Leonidas Polk, Matthew Calbraith\r\nPerry, Nathaniel Hawthorne, Captain Jansen of Holland, Baron Justus\r\nvon Liebig, John A. Dahlgren, William Gilmore Simms, Nathaniel Parker\r\nWillis, Michael Faraday, Benjamin Silliman, Jefferson Davis, Sam\r\nHouston, Donald McKay, and dozens of others whose names are not now so\r\nwell remembered,—scientists, statesmen, and men of affairs. Maury’s\r\npersonality was such as easily to turn an acquaintance into a friend,\r\nand most of his friends, whether they were illustrious men or not,\r\nshowed themselves to be friends indeed for they remained his friends in\r\ntime of need, as will be seen in the later events of his life.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n  _Courtesy of “The Journal of American History,” Vol. IV, Number 3\r\n  (1910)._\r\n\r\n  BUST OF MATTHEW FONTAINE MAURY BY E. V. VALENTINE, IN THE STATE\r\n  LIBRARY AT RICHMOND, VA.]\r\n\r\nNow, as to the kind of man they found him to be, he was in the first\r\nplace one who was remarkable for his great breadth of mind. The editor\r\nof the _Southern Literary Messenger_ was of the opinion that Maury’s\r\nastronomical researches had served to “enlarge all his perceptions and\r\ngive greater breadth to all his views”. That may be true, but he seemed\r\nto have had the natural capacity for taking a broad and extensive view\r\nof questions, some of which were world-wide in their scope. This is\r\nparticularly noteworthy in his scientific researches, and his manifold\r\nextra-professional interests also amply exemplify the great sweep of\r\nhis imaginative mind.\r\n\r\nThere was a certain charm to Maury’s conversation and presence that\r\ndrew people irresistibly to him. Nathaniel Parker Willis felt this\r\ncharm. “He made me subject”, wrote Willis, “to his personal magnetism,\r\nand while with him I had secretly vowed myself and my pen to the\r\nservice of his interests and reputation thenceforward.... He was,\r\nunconsciously to himself, to me an exquisitely interesting study of\r\ncharacter. I had long heard of him, and knew what the public generally\r\nknew of his pursuits; but my conviction was strengthened every day\r\nthat he was greatly undervalued by common repute, and that he was of a\r\nfar deeper intellect and much more of a natural philosopher than the\r\nworld with all his repute gave him credit for.... Under his exceeding\r\nmodesty and reserve, there seemed to be a vein of the _heroic_ and\r\nromantic so hidden that he was seemingly unconscious of it, and I\r\nwas quite sure before I parted with him that he was one of the _sans\r\npeur et sans reproche_ class of men; yet willing to pass for only\r\nthe industrious man of science which the world takes him for. Under\r\nthe strong magnetism of his sincere and simple manner, I formed an\r\nirresistible attachment to him, and longed to set the world right as to\r\nhis qualities”.[11]\r\n\r\nSome considered that the source of this charm lay in his strong and\r\npowerful imagination, which lifted him above the man of mere intellect\r\nand often lent the charm of eloquence to his conversation and to his\r\nlectures. Others were impressed with the simplicity and naturalness\r\nof his character, which in its quiet unostentatious manner was very\r\nprepossessing. His manners were, indeed, as simple and unpretending as\r\na child’s, and he had as keen a relish for a joke as the jolliest Jack\r\nTar that ever shipped with him.\r\n\r\nMaury had a very modest estimate of his own work. He did not claim\r\nto have discovered anything. “I only bring together”, he wrote,\r\n“the observations that others have made, and then leave it to the\r\nobservations themselves to discover their own meaning in their own way.\r\nSometimes, indeed, I do become the mouthpiece of these observations and\r\nproclaim to the world what they reveal to me. But in this I consider\r\nmyself merely as an instrument. I am fortunate, indeed, when I succeed\r\nin rightly interpreting the meaning of the observations, and am happy\r\nalways to find concurrence in the opinions expressed or entertained by\r\nolder and wiser”. His investigations on every subject were directed\r\ntoward some practical benefit to his fellowmen, and he often quoted\r\nwith appreciation the saying that he who made two blades of grass grow\r\nwhere only one had grown before was a benefactor to the world.\r\n\r\nThis practical attitude toward his work and toward life in general\r\nled Maury to have very definite ideas about education. These appeared\r\nto some extent in his scheme for a Naval School, but they were more\r\nfully revealed in his letters. Latin and Greek, he thought, should not\r\nbe given the place of first importance as compared with mathematics\r\nand chemistry, and he declared that West Point was the only tolerable\r\ninstitution in the United States because of the absence there of the\r\nhumbuggery of the Learned Languages. Female seminaries he considered\r\nto be “downright cheats” because of the superficiality of the\r\nknowledge imparted there. He was opposed to the neglect of the study\r\nof English, so prevalent in the schools and colleges of his day, and\r\nthought that Spanish, French, and German were languages well worthy of\r\nstudy. Naturally, he laid great stress on the value of mathematical,\r\ngeographical, and other scientific studies. “As for the sciences”, he\r\ndeclared, “more is now annually developed in every department thereof\r\nthan was ever known, dreamed, or thought of, by the ancients”.\r\n\r\nMaury himself had been largely self-educated, but his speeches as well\r\nas his writings show that he had read widely and discriminatingly. He\r\nwas well read not only in science and naval history and biography,\r\nbut also in the classics, and often quoted passages from Shakespeare,\r\nByron, Dante, and the Bible; in the course of a single speech he\r\nreferred intelligently to Plato, Plutarch, Seneca, Goethe, Bacon,\r\nNewton, and other authors. He is said to have been fond of reading\r\naloud to his family from Scott’s novels and poems, Shakespeare’s\r\nplays, and the works of many other British poets, particularly\r\nWordsworth and Mrs. Hemans.\r\n\r\nThe Civil War interfered materially with the education of Maury’s sons.\r\nHis eldest son Richard spent some time at the University of Virginia,\r\nwhile John Herndon was placed in the Virginia Military Institute. This\r\ninterference was a source of great disappointment to their father who\r\nhad shown the keenest interest in their education, or, as he expressed\r\nit, “putting on their armor for the battle of life”. This same cordial\r\ninterest in young men is manifest in his addresses before college\r\nstudents, and appears frequently in his correspondence. One letter in\r\nparticular is of great interest, in this connection, because of the\r\nlight it throws on Maury’s character as well as for its revelation\r\nof his ideas on education. The last portion of the letter, which was\r\nwritten to young Hamilton Lieber at the time he was on the point\r\nof entering the United States Naval Academy as a midshipman, is as\r\nfollows: “Your future position in life and your standing in the navy\r\ndepend upon the degree of energy with which you shall acquit yourself\r\nof the duties required of you as a Midshipman. If you be idle and\r\ninattentive now, you cannot hereafter recover the ground that you will\r\nlose. Letting the opportunities now afforded you pass unimproved, you\r\ncannot expect hereafter to contend, except at great odds, with your\r\ncomrades for the honors of the profession.\r\n\r\n“Make it a rule to make everything while you are young bend to your\r\nprofession. The books that you read for amusement, let them be\r\nprofessional books instead of novels—which I hope you will _never_\r\nread—read the lives of eminent naval men. I commend to your\r\nparticular attention Mackenzie’s ‘Life of Decatur’ and the ‘Life of\r\nAdmiral Collingwood’. Take these two characters as your examples, and\r\nalways have them in your eye; make them in all things, except the duel\r\nand the course toward Barron, your models.\r\n\r\n“I say never read novels, but eschew them while you are young as I hope\r\nyou will strong drink—because they are as destructive to the wholesome\r\nhabits of the mind as mint-juleps are to those of the body—they both\r\nenervate and unfit one for hard study or hard labor—and as a beverage\r\nboth are very pleasant. But hate them both, I pray you, my young\r\nfriend, for they are poisons.\r\n\r\n“Make it a rule to ask yourself at night what you have learned during\r\nthe day, and do not be content until you get a reply, and always learn\r\nsomething if it be only the meaning of a word from the dictionary.\r\n\r\n“Make it a rule to obey all orders promptly and cheerfully. It is\r\nimmaterial how disagreeable the officer giving the order may be, or\r\nhow unpleasant the duty; go about it cheerfully, never sullenly nor\r\ncarelessly. Sometimes you will find the Midshipmen disposed to turn\r\non one of their fellows and ‘run him’ as it is called. Make it a\r\nrule never to join with them in this, for it not infrequently ends,\r\nparticularly in the navy, in downright persecution.\r\n\r\n“Make it a rule never to offend, nor to seek cause of offense in the\r\nconduct of others. Be polite to all, familiar with but few. Do not\r\nbe quick to take offense; you will never find a gentleman who will\r\nwillfully and without any cause, real or imaginary, offend another.\r\nTherefore whenever you imagine yourself aggrieved either by an equal or\r\na superior officer—when you are in doubt as to whether the offense\r\nwere intended or not, go straight up to him, state the case, and ask\r\nthe meaning of the intention. Never let imaginary offenses, slights,\r\nor cuts find a place in your breast—they sour the disposition. Ask to\r\nhave them explained at once, and in asking be always polite—never show\r\ntemper.\r\n\r\n“The rule in the navy is to treat everybody as a gentleman until he\r\nproves himself otherwise. It is a good rule—observe it well. You will\r\nsometimes hear the opinion expressed that it is necessary for a young\r\nofficer to establish his courage by fighting. Now believe me, my young\r\nfriend, that the courage to stand up and be shot at is the poorest sort\r\nof courage. He only is truly brave who has the courage to do right.\r\nThis is the highest quality of bravery that a military, or any other\r\nman can possess.\r\n\r\n“The doing right, the acting up to the principle, may sometimes seem\r\nto you to be inexpedient, or it may have the appearance of making you\r\nunpopular—but this principle of conduct will build up a character\r\nfounded on the rock which nothing can shake; and let me assure you that\r\nit is unwise and always wrong for a man to have enmity in his breast\r\nbetween himself and his conscience. When principle is involved, be deaf\r\nto expediency. It is a dangerous word to all classes of men. I would,\r\nif I could, teach you almost to hate it.”\r\n\r\nNow, a man who could attract and hold friends as Maury did would\r\nnaturally be one whose family life was a happy one. This, indeed, was\r\ntrue in his case. He was a faithful son who made his home that of his\r\nparents in their old age, a thoughtful and considerate brother to\r\nhis sisters and brothers, even sharing his home for a time with his\r\nbrother’s widow and her children and often having other relatives\r\nunder his roof. To his wife and children, Maury was their perfect ideal\r\nof a husband and father; while to him the happiest of all places was\r\nhis home, and when he was away from it his mind was constantly filled\r\nwith thoughts of his family. Many of his letters to friends contain\r\nreferences to his children, whose childish sayings he never tired of\r\nrepeating.\r\n\r\nHis family, of course, knew Maury most intimately of all, and the\r\nfollowing account of his appearance, personality, and home life is\r\nof particular interest and value: “Maury was a stout man, and about\r\nfive feet six inches in height; he had a fresh, ruddy complexion, with\r\ncurling brown hair, and clear, tender blue eyes. His massive head and\r\nstrong neck surmounted broad and square shoulders, and a chest deep\r\nand full. His arms were long and strong, with hands small, soft, and\r\nbeautifully formed—he was apt to use them in graceful gestures while\r\nconversing.\r\n\r\n“Every feature and lineament of his bright countenance bespoke\r\nintellect, kindliness, and force of character. His fine blue eyes\r\nbeamed from under his broad forehead with thought and emotion, while\r\nhis flexible mouth smiled with the pleasure of imparting to others the\r\nideas which were ever welling up in his active brain. In early manhood\r\nhis head was well covered with fine soft, wavy brown hair, which became\r\nthin before he reached middle age. Latterly, he was quite bald, as is\r\nshown in Valentine’s fine bust, taken when he was sixty years old.\r\n\r\n“His conversation was enjoyed by all who ever met him; he listened and\r\nlearned while he conversed, and adapted himself to every capacity.\r\nHe especially delighted in the company of young people, to whom his\r\nplayful humor and gentle consideration made him very winning.\r\n\r\n“In his early youth he was careless in his dress, and expressed\r\ncontempt for those who judged of a man by his outward appearance.\r\n‘But’, he said, ‘I soon perceived the folly of this carelessness’;\r\nand in later years he became scrupulously neat in his attire. His\r\nenjoyment of the pleasures of the table was refined; he liked good\r\nwine; he carved well, and entertained generously; and he was never more\r\ngenial, humorous, or interesting than when surrounded by friends about\r\na well-served board”.[12]\r\n\r\nThe account of his home life continues as follows: “Whether writing or\r\nthinking, no noise of the children, no invasion of visitors, was ever\r\nan interruption. In the midst of his most interesting pursuits, on\r\nwhich he was concentrating his powers, he would lay down his pen and\r\njoin in the laugh at a good joke, and encourage the mirth to go on.\r\nHe had an ever-active sense of humor; but scandal and gossip he would\r\nnot allow in his presence, and he would never pass over any violation\r\nof high principle. He made loving companions and friends of his\r\nchildren—in his walks, in his talks, in his work, in his recreation,\r\nhe was always one of them. He invited their confidence, and freely gave\r\nthem his; in that household there were no secrets—any step that was\r\nabout to be taken, any journey made, or any work projected, was fully\r\nand freely talked over and discussed in family conclave. And yet his\r\nword was law; that no one ever dreamt of disputing: so he was always\r\nthe last to speak in these family councils, and gave the ‘casting\r\nvote’, as he used to say; the youngest voting or giving their opinion\r\nfirst on the matter under discussion.\r\n\r\n“Most of his voluminous writings were thus freely submitted to the\r\nfamily council, or copied by them, and each one invited and encouraged\r\nto criticise; and thus, not only were they made familiar with the\r\nworkings of his mind but were taught to express their own thoughts.\r\nHe wrote or composed and dictated his greatest books in his parlor,\r\nsurrounded by his family, and it seemed sometimes as if he possessed\r\na dual consciousness, so quickly could he abstract or concentrate his\r\nmind upon his writing.\r\n\r\n“Like few great men, he was the greater the closer one got to him.\r\nLittle children approached him confidingly, and never left him without\r\nbearing away some good lesson, so gently and simply taught as to be\r\nforever planted in their young minds. His especial pleasure was to say\r\na kind word and lend a helping hand to young men beginning the battle\r\nof life. Above all men, he knew the value of praise as an incentive to\r\nhigh endeavor, and when he had occasion to censure or criticise, he did\r\nit with such obvious reluctance that it never failed to do the good\r\nintended. While at home, he had been taught to respect women, to love\r\nthe truth, and to reverence God; and these teachings he never forgot.\r\n\r\n“One of his daughters writes as follows: ‘He never had a study or\r\nanything like a sanctum, where his wife and children could not come,\r\npreferring to work in the midst of them wherever they congregated. He\r\nwould sit at the round marble-topped center table, with his papers\r\nspread out, the bright light falling on his bald head and shining on\r\nhis brown curls, while he sat unconscious of what was going on around\r\nhim; whether it was music, or dancing, or reading aloud, or romping, he\r\nwould write away, or read what he had written, or talk to himself and\r\nshake his head’.\r\n\r\n“His daughters often served as his amanuenses, and sometimes he\r\ndictated to two at once, while one of the little ones would balance\r\nherself on the rounds of his chair, and curl his back hair over the\r\nred-and-blue pencil he always used. Sometimes he would walk up and down\r\nthe two parlors wrapped in a light blue silk Japanese dressing-gown,\r\nquilted with eider down, which was a present from Captain Jansen,\r\nthe long ribbons, which should have been fastened around his waist,\r\ntrailing behind him, or gathered up like reins in the hands of one of\r\nthe little ones, who trotted after him, backwards and forwards, calling\r\nout ‘Gee, woa!’ or ‘Back, sir!’—he paying not the slightest attention,\r\nbut dictating gravely.\r\n\r\n“He used to say he was the youngest of the family except the baby, and\r\nit was his habit, when dressing in the morning, to seat the youngest\r\n(the little two-year-old) upon the bureau, to hold the soap while he\r\nwas shaving; while the rest would stand around, one to hold or receive\r\nthe razor, one the brush, one the towel, and one or two the papers on\r\nwhich to wipe the razor; and we all would eagerly watch the pile of\r\nlather which he made with the soap and hot water in his shaving-can. He\r\nbrushed his bald head with two immense brushes at the same time, one in\r\neach hand. ‘For’, he assured us gravely, ‘you see, if I only use one at\r\na time, it will turn me round and round like one oar in a boat’. And\r\nwe believed that that was the only way to brush hair. Then he would\r\ntell us stories and anecdotes about his brothers and himself—what\r\nthey did and what they said in Tennessee, and of his home life there.\r\nThese stories he would tell over and over again, fitting them to the\r\ncomprehension of the ‘two-year-old’, as she or he would come on, until\r\nwe knew them by heart, and, with a clamor of tongues, would set him\r\nright if he omitted any incident or related it in the wrong order. And\r\nwe knew exactly when to laugh and applaud, and enjoyed it all the more\r\nbecause it was so familiar.\r\n\r\n“Often he would take the whole tribe out for long walks, or to gather\r\nfruit or nuts, or bright-colored leaves; and to reach the high ones he\r\nwould make what he called a ‘Tennessee arm’, which was a long pole with\r\na crutch at the end, with which he could twist them off, directing us\r\nwhere to stand and hold up our little pinafores to catch the coveted\r\nprize; and then what laughter and hurrahs and congratulations would be\r\nbestowed upon the fortunate catcher! He had pet names for all except\r\nthe eldest; he said she grew up too fast for him to fit a name to her.\r\nThere were ‘Nannie Curly’, ‘Goggen’, ‘Davy Jones’, ‘Totts’, ‘Glum’,\r\n‘Brave’, and ‘Sat Sing’. By these names he always called us, and we\r\nknew we had displeased him, and hung our heads with shame, if he gave\r\nus our baptismal ones.\r\n\r\n“I don’t think I ever went to school more than three months altogether.\r\nHe was my loving and tender teacher always; and when Betty and I grew\r\nto be fifteen or thereabouts, we had to take care of one or two of the\r\nyounger ones and teach them to read, write, and cipher, yet without\r\nallowing this duty to interfere with our own lessons or our regular\r\ntasks of sewing. He taught us our lessons at the breakfast table, and\r\nfor an hour or so afterwards, his plan being to bid us—my sister Betty\r\nand myself—‘one at a time, tell him about the lesson’. He seldom\r\nasked us questions on it, unless we found a difficulty in expressing\r\nourselves, and he never asked those put down in the book. After both\r\nhad had our say, he would, taking the lesson for a text, deliver the\r\nmost delightful lectures. He prescribed no set time for our preparation\r\nof these lessons; but we were required to master them thoroughly, and\r\ngive the substance to him clothed in our own words and not in those of\r\nthe book. He always expected and required that we should not prepare\r\nthem at night, but should then come into the parlor to receive and\r\nentertain and be entertained by the distinguished men and women who\r\nfrequently gathered round him. He considered this a most important part\r\nof our education.\r\n\r\n“He objected to the introduction of cards in the family circle, as he\r\nsaid they interfered with intelligent and improving conversation, and\r\nthat those who had recourse to them for amusement were apt to depend\r\non them, and could not exert themselves to be agreeable as they should\r\nand would do, if they had not this entertainment. He himself did not\r\nknow one card from another. Our Mother taught us our Bible lessons and\r\ncatechism, and she and Aunt Eliza, who was a beautiful needlewoman,\r\ngave us regular tasks in mending and darning. We seldom went to church\r\nmore than once on Sunday, as it was so far from the Observatory to St.\r\nJohn’s (Reverend Doctor Pynes); so Papa had us up regularly for the\r\nevening service, which we would read verse about, ‘the stranger that\r\nwas within our gates’ generally taking part also....\r\n\r\n“He would never allow us to read works of fiction whilst we were\r\nstudents, and would punish most severely any departure from the truth,\r\nor act of disobedience. These two sins, he said, were the only ones\r\nhe intended to punish his children for; and he was very careful not\r\nto make unnecessary issues with them, and never to give an order\r\nunless he saw that it was obeyed and not forgotten. A punishment which\r\nhe inflicted once on Betty and myself I shall never forget. Betty\r\nborrowed ‘Helen’, one of a very handsome and complete set of Miss\r\nEdgeworth’s novels, from cousin Sally Fontaine in Washington, thinking,\r\nor persuading herself, that Papa would not object, as that was so mild\r\na type of fiction, and we both read most of it. He found us at it one\r\nSaturday. He didn’t say one word, but took the book, and one of us in\r\neach hand, marched us downstairs into Mamma’s room, and, to our horror,\r\nthrust the handsome borrowed book into the flames, and held it there\r\nwith the tongs until it was entirely consumed. Oh, how we did cry! It\r\nseemed such a terrible thing to burn a book—a priceless book—of which\r\nwe had so few. Then our honor was touched to the quick, for we had\r\nborrowed it. But for those very reasons the lesson cut deep, and made\r\nthe impression that was intended. I for one would gladly have taken a\r\nwhipping instead, to be allowed to return the book uninjured”.[13]\r\n\r\nWhatever sternness Maury displayed toward his children, it was so\r\ntempered with gentleness and loving consideration that it did not\r\ndetract at all from the ideal relationship existing between them.\r\nWhen his two oldest daughters were married and left their father’s\r\nhome, he saw to it that the loving ties which bound them to the rest\r\nof the family were kept as strong as ever; and the letters which he\r\nwrote to them were filled with the tenderest and sincerest expressions\r\nof affection and the most tactfully worded counsel and advice. For\r\nexample, he wrote to one of them, “That you are both poor is no\r\nground of solicitude; happiness is above riches, and if you are not\r\nhappy, being poor, wealth would not, I apprehend, make you happy.\r\nPoverty has its virtues, and my struggles with it are full of pleasant\r\nremembrances. I hope your experience will tally with mine. I do not\r\nsay, strive to be content, for in that there is no progression; but be\r\ncontent to strive”. At another time he wrote, “I am writing you a very\r\ndisjointed letter, my love, but I have been thinking so much of you,\r\nand missing you so sorely, and loving you so tenderly, since you went\r\naway, and my heart was so full, and my head so empty, that I hardly\r\nknow what I have said. Did you plant the yellow jasmine at Farleyvale?\r\n’Tis the grand scion of the one I courted your Mother under, and I\r\nwish it, or a slip from it, to be planted over my grave”. This request\r\nwas carried out, and the flower grew over his grave for six or seven\r\nyears until it was killed during an extremely cold winter. The entire\r\nstory of Maury’s home life seems almost too nearly perfect to be true,\r\nbut diligent search of all available records has failed to disclose\r\nanything which would detract from the portrayal of him as always the\r\ntrue, considerate, loving husband and father.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n  _Courtesy of Mrs. Thomas Fell and Mrs. C.

He declared that he worked as hard and as faithfully\r\nfor Uncle Sam up to three o’clock of that day as he had ever done, and\r\nat that hour turned over all the public property and records of the\r\noffice to Lieutenant Whiting, the officer who was next in authority.\r\nHe left the Observatory with the deepest regret. “Its associations”,\r\nhe wrote, “the treasures there, which, with your help and that of\r\nthousands of other friendly hands, had been collected from the sea,\r\nwere precious to me and as I turned my back upon the place a tear\r\nfurrowed my cheek, for I could not but recollect that such things were”.\r\n\r\nFrom Richmond, on April 26th, he wrote to Secretary of the Navy, Gideon\r\nWelles, who had requested to know his reasons for his resignation,\r\nthe following reply: “I am not aware of any law or rule that requires\r\nan officer tendering resignation to give reasons therefor. In this\r\ncase, however, I have no objections to state them. They are these: our\r\nonce glorious Union is gone; the state through which and for which I\r\nconfessed allegiance to the Federal government has no longer any lot\r\nor part in it. Neither have I. I desire to go with my own people and\r\nwith them to share the fortunes of our own state together. Such are\r\nthe reasons for tendering my resignation, and I hope the President\r\nwill consider them satisfactory”. Maury afterwards stated in detail\r\nthe reasons for his resignation in his “A Vindication of Virginia and\r\nthe South”, which was the last thing that he prepared for the press,\r\nin May, 1871. This statement, which must be read as a whole in order\r\nto get the full force of his arguments, is much too long to quote\r\nhere; but it is sufficient to say that his action was prompted by the\r\nsame feelings and motives that inspired Lee and the dozens of other\r\nofficers in both army and navy who went with their respective states\r\nwhen secession was decided upon. Furthermore, as will be seen later, in\r\nMaury’s case the sacrifices involved were perhaps greater than those\r\nsuffered by any other man who cast his lot with the South.\r\n\r\nBut, strangely, from the very beginning of the Civil War Maury’s name\r\nwas singled out for special condemnation, and many false statements\r\nwere made about him and his work. He was accused of carrying on\r\ntreasonable correspondence with the enemy before he resigned from the\r\nservice, and of having the buoys removed from the Kettle Bottom Shoals\r\nand of taking away with him from the Observatory the maps of Georgia,\r\nAlabama, and Florida. His astronomical and meteorological work was\r\nridiculously depreciated, and toward the close of the war the National\r\nAcademy of Sciences went so far as to pass on January 9, 1864 this\r\nresolution: “Resolved by the National Academy of Sciences, That in the\r\nopinion of this Academy the volumes entitled ‘Sailing Directions’,\r\nheretofore issued to navigators from the Naval Observatory, and the\r\nwind and current charts which they are designed to illustrate and\r\nexplain, embrace much which is unsound in philosophy and little that\r\nis practically useful, and that therefore these publications ought no\r\nlonger to be issued in their present form”. Among all the injuries\r\nwhich Maury suffered from casting his fortunes with Virginia and\r\nthe South, these hostile condemnations by former fellow officers and\r\nscientists, made in the midst of the animosities of civil strife, were\r\nperhaps the most damaging, for they cast a cloud upon his good name\r\nand the fame which he had won in the field of oceanography,—a cloud\r\nof misrepresentation which after more than half a century has not been\r\nentirely removed.\r\n\r\nUpon Maury’s arrival at Richmond, he lost no time in offering his\r\nservices to Governor Letcher, who granted him a commission as commander\r\nin the Navy of Virginia, dated April 23, 1861. At about the same\r\ntime he appointed him a member of his Executive Council, only just\r\nauthorized by an ordinance of April 20. Its other members were:\r\nHonorable John J. Allen, President of the Court of Appeals; Colonel\r\nFrancis H. Smith, Superintendent of the Virginia Military Institute;\r\nR. L. Montague; and Thomas S. Haymond. This council, ordered to devise\r\nplans for the arming and protecting of the state in the shortest time\r\npossible, continued to function until June 19 of the same year, when\r\nits manuscript minutes come abruptly to a close. On April 25, Virginia\r\nhad joined the Confederate States and adopted their provisional\r\ngovernment; and on April 29 Richmond had become the Capital of the\r\nConfederacy. The Virginia State Navy was then incorporated with that of\r\nthe Confederacy, and on June 10 Maury received his commission in the\r\nConfederate States Navy.\r\n\r\nOn the following day Maury wrote, “I begin to feel very useless. I\r\nam afraid there is too much red tape yet left in the world. I hope\r\nit may not tie us down”. After remarking that there were small men\r\nin the Confederate government, and that there had been conflicts\r\nbetween Virginia authority and that of the Confederacy, he continued,\r\n“Davis, it appears to me, is grasping after patronage. Don’t think he\r\nlikes Lee. Lee told me yesterday he did not know where he was. Nor\r\ndo I. I can see though how that may have proceeded from an honest\r\nmisunderstanding. But it’s bad in times like this to so jar your\r\ngeneral that he does not know whether he is in or out of power....\r\nWhere the wrong is I am not so clear, but the biggest promotions\r\nseem to be on the other side. You may rely upon it, the Confederate\r\nStates government has come here feeling that there is between it and\r\nus something of antagonism”. Maury had reason to feel uncertain as to\r\nhis standing, for Davis had been unfriendly to him when he was seeking\r\nvindication for the unjust action of the Retiring Board, and his\r\nstrongest opponent at that time had been Mallory, then Chairman of the\r\nSenate Naval Affairs Committee and later Secretary of the Navy in the\r\nConfederate government. Besides, among the naval officers whom Maury\r\nhad affronted during that unpleasant controversy was Buchanan, who had\r\nbecome the officer of highest rank in the Confederate Navy.\r\n\r\nMaury had the affairs of his family on his mind also, and he was\r\nparticularly concerned over his wife who had been made ill by the\r\nshock incident to the sudden outbreak of the war and the breaking up\r\nof her home in Washington. She and her younger children had, through\r\nthe kindness of a cousin, John Minor, been taken into his home in\r\nFredericksburg, a handsome brick house with a lovely garden, which\r\nstill stands at 214 Main Street much as it appeared when the refugees\r\noccupied it. Here came also Maury’s two married daughters with their\r\nchildren, Mrs. W. A. Maury with her one child from Washington, and\r\nMrs. Corbin with her two children from her country place which was so\r\nnear the Potomac that it soon fell into the hands of the Federals. His\r\nsons-in-law and his two eldest sons had early entered the Confederate\r\narmy. His mind was greatly disturbed also because of his financial\r\ninvestments in the North, which had been made through his cousin\r\nRutson Maury of New York and his friend Hasbrouck of Newburgh, New\r\nYork. The latter remained a true friend in spite of the war, and at\r\nMaury’s request was able to save a small part of his investments.\r\nTheir relation, as effected by the war, is an example of the many that\r\nexisted of like nature, and its peculiar poignancy is indicated in this\r\nletter: “The nefarious Civil War that rages has not and I trust never\r\nmay cool our hearts towards you and your dear family. My son Henry is\r\nan officer in the army of the North, he could not with honor decline to\r\nserve in it. Your son Richard is an officer in the army of the South,\r\nas you informed me in one of your letters, and could not probably with\r\nhonor decline to serve in it. I sincerely hope that Henry and Richard\r\nmay never meet in any battle during this unhappy war, and by duty and\r\nhonor be obliged to shed each other’s blood”.\r\n\r\nMaury, however, did not allow separation from his family and depression\r\nof spirits to interfere with the performance of what he considered\r\nhis duty, but made an enthusiastic endeavor to make the most possible\r\nout of conditions as he found them. He first assisted in fortifying\r\nJamestown Island in the James River and Gloucester Point on the York\r\nRiver, early in May, 1861, for the defense of Richmond. Besides he sat\r\nalmost daily with the Governor’s Executive Council to consider the\r\nmany problems which confronted the State in her time of great need.\r\nIn the summer of 1861 he was appointed Chief of the “Naval Bureau of\r\nCoast, Harbor, and River Defense”, and began to plan the construction\r\nof submarine mines to be placed in the rivers and harbors of the\r\nSouth. These were to be exploded under enemy ships by electricity,\r\nand insulated wire was needed for this purpose. He accordingly sent\r\na Richmond merchant to New York to secure a large quantity of such\r\nwire. The merchant failed in his mission, but Maury undismayed set\r\nabout devising mines which could be exploded in a different way. Each\r\nmine consisted of an oak cask filled with 200 pounds of powder, in the\r\nhead of which was a trigger attached to a fuse. The casks were joined\r\ntogether in pairs by 500 feet of rope, and when in a favorable position\r\nwere let go to be carried by the tide down upon an enemy ship in such\r\na way as to have the rope catch across the cable of the vessel. As the\r\nmines drifted near the ship, the strain on the rope would release the\r\ntriggers, ignite the fuses, and explode the mines.\r\n\r\nEarly in July, 1861, Maury himself commanded an expedition from\r\nSewell’s Point near Norfolk, which made an attempt to destroy the Union\r\nvessels _Minnesota_, _Roanoke_, and _Cumberland_, then off Fortress\r\nMonroe. The attacking party in five boats set off about ten o’clock.\r\nMaury was in the first boat with the pilot and four oarsmen; while each\r\nof the others carried an officer and four men, together with one of\r\nthe mines. It was a very quiet Sunday evening, and as the enemy had no\r\nguard boats, the attacking party was able, under muffled oars, to take\r\nup a position near enough for their purpose just as seven bells struck\r\non board the intended victims. The mines were immediately set adrift,\r\nand the boats rowed away. But no explosions followed, for something\r\nhad gone wrong with the mechanism of the mines. Afterwards it was found\r\nthat the type of fuse which had been used would not burn in a pressure\r\nof twenty feet of water, the depth at which the mines had been floated.\r\nLater, the torpedoes, as they were then called, were discovered by the\r\nFederals, taken out of the water, and carried away as relics.\r\n\r\nMaury was not overly discouraged, but returned to Richmond to continue\r\nhis experiments so as to perfect an apparatus which would be more\r\nsuccessful next time. These experiments were made possible through the\r\nassistance of the Richmond Medical College, which furnished batteries\r\nand offered the use of its laboratory, and by the help of the Tredegar\r\nIron Works as well as those of Talbot and Son. Maury carried on these\r\nexperiments at the house of his cousin Robert H. Maury in Richmond at\r\n1105 East Clay Street, which was marked in 1910 by the Confederate\r\nMemorial Society with this commemorative inscription: “In this house,\r\nMatthew Fontaine Maury, LL. D., U. S. N., C. S. N., invented the\r\nsubmarine Electrical Torpedo, 1861–62”.\r\n\r\nWhile engaged in this work, Maury set forth his hopes of success in the\r\nfollowing letter: “I am experimenting upon my deep sea batteries and so\r\nfar, as difficulties have presented themselves, they have one by one\r\nbeen overcome. I shall be ready for demonstration next week I hope....\r\nThen if I can get the powder, I will launch in the Potomac, the\r\nChesapeake, and its tributaries hundreds of these things in pairs, each\r\npair connected by a line several hundred feet in length and in such a\r\nmanner that if the line fouls the vessel while she is at anchor, or\r\nany vessel crosses the line while she is under weigh, the tightening\r\nof the line will pull a trigger and let the things off. I think I can\r\ndrive the enemy out of the Chesapeake. This is a business, this thing\r\nof blowing up men while they are asleep, that I don’t glory in.... I\r\nshall endeavor to pick up and save the crews from drowning”.\r\n\r\nMaury was not given an opportunity to demonstrate his improved mine,\r\nuntil late in July or early in August, 1861, when the Secretary of\r\nthe Navy, the Governor of Virginia, and the Chairman of the Committee\r\nof Naval Affairs consented to witness a trial on the James River at\r\nRocketts, where the James River Steamboat Company’s wharf is now\r\nlocated. Maury thus describes the trial: “I made a pair of submarine\r\nbatteries. Your man Mallory pronounced them humbugs. I got him and\r\nConrad (Chairman of Naval Affairs Committee, House of Representatives)\r\nto go and see them blow up the James River. I put them adrift aiming\r\nthem at a buoy. They caught, drifted down, tightened the rope, pulled\r\nthe trigger, and off they went blowing the river, or some of it, sky\r\nhigh and killing innumerable fish. So Mallory after that asked for an\r\nappropriation of $50,000 to enable me to go ahead”.\r\n\r\nThis money was not, however, immediately forthcoming, and Maury\r\ncomplained that he was forced to lay on his oars and wait for the\r\nword from Congress, “Go ahead!” He also wrote that he was anxious\r\nto mine the river passes to both Richmond and Fredericksburg with\r\nthese submarine batteries which would be exploded by electricity,\r\nbut that lack of materials was delaying the project. During this\r\ndelay, he planned another attack on the Union ships off Newport News.\r\nThis materialized in an attempt which was made, on October 10, by\r\nLieutenant Robert D. Minor to sink the _Savannah_ and the _Minnesota_,\r\nbut this second trial also met with failure. Maury had planned to take\r\npart himself in the attack, but was prevented from doing so by his\r\nbeing ordered to Richmond with the expectation of being sent to mine\r\nthe Mississippi River. He did not, however, go on this mission, though\r\nhe had considerable correspondence with General Polk, who wished to\r\nplace mines in the river at Columbus, Kentucky. Some mines were sent to\r\nMemphis with full instructions as to how they should be planted; and\r\nhere others were constructed, after Maury’s model, to be used elsewhere\r\non the river.\r\n\r\nAbout the first of May, 1862, Maury had the good fortune to secure ten\r\nmiles of insulated wire which enabled him to mine the James River with\r\nelectric mines, according to the plans which he had been compelled to\r\nlay aside for several months for lack of material. This wire had been\r\nused by the Federals in attempting to lay a submarine telegraph across\r\nthe Chesapeake from Fortress Monroe to Eastville; but having been\r\nforced to abandon the attempt, they left the wire in the water and the\r\nwaves cast it upon the beach near Norfolk where a friend, Dr. Morris,\r\nsecured it for Maury’s use.\r\n\r\nThe following report describes the mines that were then constructed\r\nand relates how they were laid down in the James River early in June,\r\n1862: “The James River is mined with fifteen tanks below the iron\r\nbattery at Chapin’s (Chaffin’s) Bluff. They are to be exploded by means\r\nof electricity. Four of the tanks contain 160 pounds of powder; the\r\neleven others hold 70 pounds each. All are made of boiler plate. They\r\nare arranged in rows as per diagram, those of each row being 30 feet\r\napart. Each tank is contained in a water-tight wooden cask, capable\r\nof floating it but anchored and held below the surface from three to\r\neight feet, according to the state of the tide. The anchors of each are\r\nan 18-inch shell and a piece of kentledge, so placed as to prevent the\r\nbarrels from fouling the buoy ropes at the change of the tide. Each\r\nshell of a row is connected with the one next to it by a stout rope\r\nthirty feet long and capable of lifting it in case the cask be carried\r\naway. The casks are water-tight, as are also the tanks, the electric\r\ncord entering through the same head.\r\n\r\n“The wire for the return current from the battery is passed from shell\r\nto shell and along the connecting rope, which lies at the bottom.\r\nThe wire that passes from cask to cask is stopped slack to the buoy\r\nrope from the shell up to the cask, to which it is securely seized to\r\nprevent any strain upon that part which enters the cask. The return\r\nwire is stopped in like manner down along the span to the next shell,\r\nas per the rough sketch. At 4 (in the sketch) the two cords are frapped\r\ntogether, loaded with trace chains a fathom apart, and carried ashore\r\nto the galvanic battery.\r\n\r\n“For batteries we have 21 Wollastons, each trough containing eighteen\r\npairs of plates, zinc and iron, ten by twelve inches. The first range\r\nis called 1, the second 2, and the third 3, and the wires are so\r\nlabeled. Thus all of each range are exploded at once.\r\n\r\n“Besides these, there are two ranges of two tanks each, planted\r\nopposite the battery at Chapin’s Bluff. When they were planted, it was\r\nnot known that a battery was to be erected below. These four tanks\r\ncontain about 6,000 pounds of powder. The great freshet of last month\r\ncarried away the wires that were to operate the first pair, ‘A’ (in a\r\ndiagram enclosed, which showed the exact location of the various mines).\r\n\r\n“Lieutenant Davidson, who with the _Teaser_ and her crew has assisted\r\nme with a most hearty good will, has dragged for the tanks without\r\nsuccess. They rest on the bottom. Could they be found, it was my\r\nintention to raise the four, examine them, and, if found in good order,\r\nplace them below the range, ‘I’.\r\n\r\n“Lieutenant William L. Maury, assisted by Acting Master W. F. Carter\r\nand R. Rollins, was charged with the duty of proving the tanks and\r\npacking them in casks. There are eleven others, each containing 70\r\npounds of powder. When tested in the barrels and found ready for use,\r\nthey will be held in reserve in case of accident to those already down.\r\nA larger number was not prepared, for the want of powder. There are a\r\nquantity of admirable insulated wire, a number of shells for anchors or\r\ntorpedoes, and a sufficient quantity of chains for the wires remaining.\r\nThey will be put in the navy store for safe-keeping. The galvanic\r\nbatteries; viz., 21 Wollastons and 1 Cruikshank, the latter loaned by\r\nDr. Maupin of the University of Virginia, with spare acids, sulphuric\r\nand nitric, are at Chapin’s Bluff in charge of Acting Master Cheeney.\r\nHe has also in jugs a sufficient quantity mixed to work the batteries,\r\nand ready to be poured in for use.\r\n\r\n“It is proper that I should mention to the Department in terms of\r\ncommendation the ready and valuable assistance afforded by Dr. Morris,\r\npresident telegraph company, and his assistant, especially by Mr.\r\nGoldwell. My duties in connection with these batteries being thus\r\nclosed, I have the honor to await your further orders”.\r\n\r\nMaury was relieved, on the 20th of June, 1862, by Lieutenant Hunter\r\nDavidson of the duty of “devising, placing, and superintending\r\nsubmarine batteries in the James River”. Davidson was at the time in\r\ncommand of the _Teaser_, and to signalize his new appointment, he had\r\nthe misfortune, on July 4, of losing his ship to the enemy, together\r\nwith the diagrams showing the exact position of the mines already laid\r\ndown.\r\n\r\nAlthough Maury’s participation in this new field of warfare had\r\nextended over only a little more than the first year of the war, still\r\nhis pioneer work therein deserves high consideration as it laid the\r\nfoundation for experiments by other Confederate officers, and these\r\nmines, electric and otherwise, resulted in the loss during the war\r\nof a large number of Union ships, varying from 20 to 58 according to\r\ndifferent authorities. These facts bear out the following claim made\r\nby Maury: “All the electrical torpedoes in that (James) river were\r\nprepared and laid down either by myself or by Lieutenant Davidson\r\nwho relieved me after having been instructed by me as to the details\r\nof the system. These were the first electrical torpedoes that were\r\nsuccessfully used against an enemy in war”.\r\n\r\nMaury did not pretend that the idea was original with him. Robert\r\nFulton had had a device for firing a mine by electricity, but had never\r\nsucceeded in making his battery work. Also Colonel Colt experimented\r\nwith some success with such mines as early as 1842. Maury’s work was\r\nso important because he was the first to demonstrate that such weapons\r\ncould be made of practical use in warfare. He has, however, been given\r\nalmost no credit, until recently, for this pioneer work. Even Jefferson\r\nDavis, in his “Rise and Fall of the Confederate Government”, makes\r\nno mention of Maury’s name in connection with the electric mines, but\r\ngives all the honor to General Gabriel J. Rains, who did not become\r\nhead of the Torpedo Bureau until October, 1862. Scharf’s “History of\r\nthe Confederate States Navy” names not only Rains but also Hunter\r\nDavidson and Beverly Kennon as rivals for priority in the invention and\r\npractical use of the electric mine. The claims of the first two are so\r\nextravagant and so unjust to Maury as to merit no consideration; while\r\nthose of Kennon cannot be successfully sustained in comparison with the\r\nwell-established priority of Maury’s “electrical torpedoes”.\r\n\r\nThese electric mines were not the only new naval weapons that Maury\r\nadvocated and had a hand in devising. In the autumn of 1861, he wrote\r\na series of articles for the Richmond _Enquirer_ under the pseudonym\r\nof “Ben Bow”, in which he urged the necessity of building a strong\r\nnavy for the South without delay, and of providing, at least, for the\r\nprotection of bays and rivers by the construction of small ships armed\r\nwith big guns. Maury had had in mind such a fighting craft for years,\r\nand as early as 1841 he had urged the building of ships of this sort in\r\nhis “Scraps from the Lucky Bag”.\r\n\r\nIn these “Ben Bow” articles he called attention to the fact that the\r\nConfederate government had not as yet realized the need for a navy.\r\n“The sums appropriated by the Government”, he wrote, “for _building and\r\nincrease_ will indicate its policy touching a navy, and show what, for\r\nthe present, is proposed to be done. Two Navy Bills have passed since\r\nVirginia seceded and joined the Confederacy. One was passed in May at\r\nMontgomery, and the other in Richmond in August. In the Montgomery\r\nBill there is not one dime for construction or increase. The whole\r\nappropriation is $278,500, of which $100,000 is for equipment and\r\nrepairs. Now a navy without vessels is like lamps without oil. The\r\nRichmond Bill gives $50,000 to buy and build steamers and gunboats\r\nfor coast defense, and $160,000 for two ironclad gunboats for the\r\ndefense of the Mississippi River and the city of Memphis.... We may\r\nsafely infer that $50,000 will neither purchase nor build a great\r\nmany steamers or gunboats, nor enable us to provide very efficiently\r\nfor the defense of all the rivers except the Mississippi, and of\r\nall the harbors, bays, creeks, and sounds of our coast all the way\r\nfrom Washington on the Potomac to Brownsville on the Rio Grande.\r\nThus we perceive that since Virginia and North Carolina, with their\r\ndefenseless, open, and inviting sea-front, seceded, the sum of only\r\n$50,000 has been voted towards the ‘purchase or construction’ of a\r\nnavy, for the defense of the entire seacoast of the Confederacy! From\r\nthis analysis, and from all that we can see doing on the water, it\r\nappears that the Government has not yet decided to have a navy”.\r\n\r\nIt was a mistake, he thought, to believe that there was a magic power\r\nin cotton, that “Cotton is King” and could do all and more than it\r\nwas possible for a navy to accomplish. Along this line, he declared,\r\n“There seems to be a vague idea floating in the public mind of the\r\nSouth that, somehow or other, cotton is to enable us to do, if not\r\nentirely, at least to a great degree, what other nations require armies\r\nand navies to accomplish for them. Because cotton-wool is essential to\r\nthe industry of certain people, and because we are the chief growers\r\nof cotton-wool, therefore, say these political dreamers, we can so\r\ntreat cotton, in a diplomatic way, as both to enforce obedience to our\r\nrevenue laws at home and secure respect to our citizens abroad. But can\r\nwe? Did ever unprotected wealth secure immunity to its owner? In the\r\nfirst place, cotton becomes, when handled in any other way than the\r\nregular commercial way, a two-edged sword, as apt to wound producer as\r\nconsumer. Every obstacle, which we place between it and the channels of\r\ncommerce here, operates as a bounty for its production elsewhere. It\r\nis a very current but mistaken idea to suppose that this is the only\r\ncountry in the world properly adapted to the cultivation of cotton.\r\nNo such thing. Should even the present paper blockade continue for a\r\nfew years, and cotton rule at the present New York prices of 22 cents,\r\nor even at 15 cents, our political dreamers may wake up and find the\r\ncotton scepter, if not entirely lost to our hold, at least divided\r\nin our hand.... Suppose England and France do not choose for a few\r\nmonths to come to break this paper blockade, which we have not the\r\nnaval strength to force, paper though it be, does it follow that that\r\nblockade, weak and ineffectual as, up to this time, it has notoriously\r\nbeen, will continue so until those nations get ready to act? The amount\r\nappropriated for the Lincoln navy during the current year is upwards\r\nof $40,000,000.... We cannot, either with cotton or with all the\r\nagricultural staples of the Confederacy put together, adopt any course\r\nwhich will make cotton and trade stand us as a nation in the stead of a\r\nnavy”.\r\n\r\nThen followed his statement as to the kind of war vessels that were\r\nneeded to give the Confederacy command, at least, of its own waters,\r\nand at an expense of no more than three million dollars. “In this\r\nchange of circumstances”, he wrote, “it so happens that the navy\r\nwhich we most require is for smooth water and shallow places. Such a\r\none, consisting of small vessels, can be quickly and cheaply built. We\r\nwant at once a navy for our rivers and creeks and bays and sounds; a\r\nnavy consisting chiefly of vessels that, for the most part, will only\r\nbe required to keep the sea for a few days at a time.” These ships\r\nwould be so small as to present little more than a feather-edge as\r\na target to the enemy, and therefore be more invulnerable than the\r\nbest shot-proof men-of-war. They would be not more than twenty or\r\ntwenty-five feet broad, and with coal, crew, and guns aboard would\r\nfloat only two or three feet above the surface of the water. They were,\r\nin fact, to be really nothing but floating gun carriages, propelled\r\nby steam, and each was to carry two rifled cannon of the largest\r\ncaliber. Such a ship would be able to engage, at long range, one of the\r\nlargest ships of the Union navy, the _Minnesota_, for example; and in\r\nattacking head on, she would present a target of but forty square feet\r\nas compared with one of six thousand square feet of the _Minnesota_.\r\nThis, at a distance of two or three miles, would be a great advantage\r\nto the smaller vessel. Maury claimed for this type of ship facility of\r\nconstruction, rapidity in equipment, economy in outfit, and efficiency\r\nin battle. The cost of one hundred of these small vessels, including\r\narmament, engine, and machinery, he estimated, would be $10,000 each.\r\n\r\nThis dogma of “big guns and little ships” made a very favorable\r\nimpression on Governor Letcher and other prominent Virginians, and\r\nso Maury decided to bring the matter of their construction before\r\nthe state government. But beyond his expectation, his plan met with\r\nfavor in the Confederate Congress, which took over from the state of\r\nVirginia the support of the measure by passing two acts on December 23,\r\n1861. These authorized the construction of not more than a hundred of\r\nthe gunboats, according to a plan submitted by Maury and approved by a\r\nboard of naval officers, and provided also $2,000,000 for that purpose.\r\n\r\nMaury set to work superintending the building of the gunboats on the\r\nRappahannock and at Norfolk. They were 21 feet in beam and 112 feet\r\nin length, and drew six feet of water. Their armament consisted of a\r\n9-inch gun forward and a 32-pounder aft, and each carried a crew of\r\nforty men. By the middle of April, 1862, Maury expected to have the\r\nlast hull ready for the machinery and guns. But delay was occasioned\r\nthrough the difficulty of procuring materials, both iron and wood,\r\nand steam engines, and also by the lack of a sufficient number of\r\nmechanics. Meanwhile the _Merrimac_[14] (C. S. S. _Virginia_) had\r\ndemonstrated the great possibilities of iron-plated rams, and the\r\nConfederate Congress authorized, on March 17, 1862, the discontinuance\r\nof all such construction of wooden gunboats as might retard the\r\nbuilding of ironclad rams.\r\n\r\nSecretary of the Navy Mallory, who had not warmly supported Maury’s\r\nscheme, then suggested to President Davis that the fifteen already\r\ncommenced be finished according to the original design, but that\r\nthe remainder of the appropriation be diverted to the building of\r\nironclads. A few days later Maury wrote, “All my gunboats are to be\r\nconverted into shot proof or abandoned”. Thus ended in comparative\r\nfailure this ambitious experiment, one that was very dear to Maury.\r\nThat he held Mallory very much to blame is evident from the following:\r\n“The administration is gravely proposing to build here at Richmond a\r\nnavy to go down and capture Fortress Monroe! Mal. proposed the other\r\nday that I should undertake to build such a navy, asserting that it\r\ncould be done. That, I should say, is a considerable stirring up. Less\r\nthan a year ago, I was to be banished for advocating a navy. Now since\r\nall our naval waters have been taken away and we have nowhere to float\r\na navy, yet we are to have a navy to take the strongest fortress in\r\nAmerica. Hurra for Mal.!”\r\n\r\nThere were many others besides Maury who considered that Mallory’s\r\nadministration of the Navy Department was inefficient. This is clearly\r\nshown by the fact that, on August 27, 1862, the Confederate Congress\r\nordered a joint special committee of both houses to investigate the\r\naffairs of this department of the government. Its investigations\r\nextended from September 4, 1862 until March 24, 1863, and developed\r\na great deal of evidence of inefficient management; but Mallory was\r\ntoo strong politically to be ousted from his position. Another severe\r\ncritic of the Secretary of the Navy is Pollard who, in remarking\r\non the great energy which the North from the beginning of the war\r\ndisplayed in naval preparations, declared, “The Confederate government\r\nshowed a singular apathy with respect to any work of defense. The\r\nConfederate Congress had made large appropriations for the construction\r\nof gunboats on the Mississippi waters; there was the best navy-yard\r\non the continent opposite Norfolk; there were valuable armories with\r\ntheir machinery at Richmond; and although the Confederate government\r\nwas very far from competing with the naval resources of the enemy, yet\r\nthere is no doubt, with the means and appliances at hand, it might have\r\ncreated a considerable fleet. In no respect was the improvidence of the\r\ngovernment more forcibly illustrated than in the administration of its\r\nnaval affairs; or its unfortunate choice of ministers more signally\r\ndisplayed than in the selection for Secretary of the Navy of Mr.\r\nMallory of Florida, a notoriously weak man who was slow and blundering\r\nin his office and a butt in Congress for his ignorance of the river\r\ngeography of the country”.[15]\r\n\r\nSoon after the moving of the Confederate capital to Richmond, Maury\r\nbegan to feel himself out of sympathy with the Southern political\r\nleaders. A week or so after the battle of Manassas he wrote that he had\r\nwished an offer of peace to be made after that victory, but that the\r\npoliticians who had become generals wanted to increase their military\r\nreputation and had opposed such a step. He went so far as to draw up\r\na peace message which he showed to the Governor of Virginia and other\r\ninfluential men. But it bore no fruit. “My peace message”, he declared,\r\n“is to go, I understand, after the next great victory. May it come\r\nsoon!” He did not have a very high opinion of Davis’s statesmanship\r\nin those early months of the war, but considered him haughty and\r\nself-willed, and surrounded by shallow men whom he was using to\r\nfurther his own future re-election. He was particularly incensed with\r\nthe inability of the administration to appreciate the importance of a\r\nnavy, and he feared that, by ignoring this service, they would permit\r\nVirginia to be degraded. There was talk, he declared, of making New\r\nOrleans or Charleston the money capital, and that the government was\r\nrun on the theory that the Confederacy belonged to Cottondom and that\r\nCotton meant to rule.\r\n\r\nMaury’s strongest censures of Mallory and Davis were made during the\r\nNovember following the publication of his “Ben Bow” articles, which\r\nbecame so distasteful to Mallory and so alarming to his political\r\nease of mind that he began to wish that Maury was entirely out of the\r\ncountry. Only a few days after the appearance of the first of these\r\narticles, he informed its author that he was to go to Cuba to purchase\r\narms and other war materials, and said to him that in his judgment he\r\ncould be better spared than any other officer in either army or navy.\r\nThis intention was not, however, carried into effect; but Mallory\r\ncontinued to trifle with Maury and to prevent him from rendering any\r\nworthy service to the South.\r\n\r\nAt about this time, Maury received from the Grand Duke Constantine\r\nan invitation to come to Russia and make his home there under the\r\npatronage of that government. The letter, which was brought to Richmond\r\nunder a flag of truce by the Russian minister, was as follows: “The\r\nnews of your having left a service which is so much indebted to your\r\ngreat and successful labors has made a very painful impression on me\r\nand my companions-in-arms. Your indefatigable researches have unveiled\r\nthe great laws which rule the winds and currents of the ocean, and\r\nhave placed your name amongst those which will ever be mentioned with\r\nfeelings of gratitude and respect, not only by professional men, but by\r\nall those who pride themselves in the great and noble attainments of\r\nthe human race. That your name is well-known in Russia I need scarcely\r\nadd, and though ‘barbarians’, as we are still sometimes called, we have\r\nbeen taught to honor in your person disinterested and eminent services\r\nto science and mankind. Sincerely deploring the inactivity into which\r\nthe present political whirlpool in your country has plunged you, I\r\ndeem myself called upon to invite you to take up your residence in\r\nthis country, where you may in peace continue your favorite and useful\r\noccupations.\r\n\r\n“Your position here will be a perfectly independent one; you will\r\nbe bound by no conditions or engagements; and you will always be\r\nat liberty to steer home across the ocean in the event of your not\r\npreferring to cast anchor in our remote corner of the Baltic.\r\n\r\n“As regards your material welfare, I beg to assure you that everything\r\nwill be done by me to make your new home comfortable and agreeable;\r\nwhilst at the same time, the necessary means will be offered you to\r\nenable you to continue your scientific pursuits in the way you have\r\nbeen accustomed to. I shall now be awaiting your reply, hoping to have\r\nthe pleasure of seeing here so distinguished an officer, whose personal\r\nacquaintance it has always been my desire to make, and whom Russia will\r\nbe proud to welcome on her soil”.\r\n\r\nThis invitation, coming at a time when Maury was being thwarted in his\r\nefforts to serve the Confederacy, must have been a great temptation.\r\nBut he did not hesitate in declining the offer; he had cast his lot\r\nwith Virginia and through her with the Confederacy. One of his\r\ndaughters relates how he came to Fredericksburg to tell his wife and\r\nchildren of the offer and its rejection. There were two letters. “One\r\nwas from His Imperial Highness, the Grand Duke Constantine, Grand\r\nAdmiral of Russia”, she wrote, “and one from Baron Stoeckle, Russian\r\nAmbassador in Washington, telling him how and by what route he was to\r\ntravel to Russia, where he was to go for passports, money, advice, and\r\ninformation. My father was now fifty-seven years old. Every maritime\r\nnation of Europe had given him evidences of their appreciation of the\r\nbenefits that their commerce had received from the use of his Wind and\r\nCurrent Charts and Sailing Directions. He read that correspondence to\r\nus in my mother’s bedroom, all of us gathered around him, before the\r\nwood fire, the young ones leaning against him looking into his face\r\nwith eager questioning eyes as he read that princely offer, and told us\r\nhe would not go”.\r\n\r\nIn his courteous reply to this generous invitation, Maury wrote that\r\nit was only his stern sense of duty that enabled him to withstand\r\nsuch inducements as none but the most magnanimous of princes could\r\noffer,—the hospitalities of a great and powerful Empire, with the\r\nGrand Admiral of its fleets for patron and friend. He assured the Grand\r\nDuke that he was grateful for the offer of a home on the banks of the\r\nNeva, where, in the midst of books and surrounded by his family and\r\nfriends, he would be free from anxiety as to the future and have the\r\nmost princely means and facilities for prosecuting those studies and\r\ncontinuing those philosophical labors in which he had taken so much\r\ndelight in former years in Washington. He then reviewed the recent\r\nevents that had taken place in the United States, and explained why\r\nhe had followed the fortunes of Virginia. “The path of duty and of\r\nhonor”, he wrote in closing, “is therefore plain. By following it with\r\nthe devotion and loyalty of a true sailor I shall, I am persuaded, have\r\nthe glorious and proud recompense that is contained in the ‘well done’\r\nof the Grand Admiral and his noble companions-in-arms. When the invader\r\nis expelled, and as soon thereafter as the State will grant me leave,\r\nI promise myself the pleasure of a trip across the Atlantic, and shall\r\nhasten to Russia that I may there in person, on the banks of the Neva,\r\nhave the honor and the pleasure of expressing to her Grand Admiral the\r\nsentiments of respect and esteem with which his oft-repeated acts of\r\nkindness, and the generous encouragement that he has afforded me in the\r\npursuits of science have inspired his—Obedient servant, M. F. Maury,\r\nCommander, C. S. Navy”.\r\n\r\nIn this decision, Maury acted like another great scientist, Louis\r\nPasteur who, when he was offered a professorship in Italy in 1871\r\nduring the Commune, would not leave France but said, “I should consider\r\nmyself a criminal deserving a penalty for desertion if I left my\r\ncountry in her unhappiness to seek a better paid position than she can\r\ngive me”.\r\n\r\nIn March, 1862, Maury began to take a hand in the foreign affairs of\r\nthe Confederacy. At this time he submitted to Colonel Orr, Chairman\r\nof the Senate Committee on Foreign Affairs, a paper setting forth the\r\nbasis of a treaty with France. About a week later he wrote a long\r\nletter to Captain De Le Marche, Depot de la Marine, Paris, stating the\r\ncommercial reasons why France ought to recognize the Confederacy; and\r\nthese reasons were presented to President Davis for his consideration.\r\nIn April, the French minister, accompanied by the Prussian envoy to the\r\nUnited States, came to Richmond under a flag of truce to pay in person\r\nhis respects to Maury, and to deliver to him an invitation from Emperor\r\nNapoleon to come to France to reside.\r\n\r\nIn view of this correspondence as well as many other letters which\r\nhe wrote to influential people in both France and Great Britain, and\r\nbecause of the evidence of the high esteem for him that was shown by\r\nthe Grand Duke Constantine and the Emperor Napoleon, it was natural\r\nthat he came to be considered a suitable representative of the South\r\nin some foreign country. As early as April, 1862 he was approached\r\nwith the offer of a mission to Europe to fit out armed cruisers; but\r\ntime dragged on without the matter being brought to a conclusion. He\r\nrepeatedly requested of Mallory some active service, as he did not wish\r\nto be a drone; and was told by the Secretary that he thought he would\r\nbe of use doing nothing. In August, Mallory did at last offer him the\r\ncommand of a gunboat at Charleston, but this Maury declined as the\r\nvessel could not go to sea and was intended merely for harbor defense.\r\n\r\nFinally, in September, Maury was ordered to England on “special\r\nservice”. That he was not pleased with this duty under the conditions\r\naccording to which he was supposed to work is revealed in the following\r\nletter, which he wrote after the close of the war: “I was sent here\r\nreally to be got out of the way, but nominally to superintend contracts\r\nwith men of straw who could not pay their hotel bills but who had made\r\npretended contracts with the Navy Department for about fifty million\r\ndollars and who never did anything. There was a great desire to have\r\nme in the Navy Department and Mallory was afraid he’d be turned out.\r\nTherefore he sent me here with hands tied, and what I did I took the\r\nresponsibility a la Tennessee.”\r\n\r\nWith little enthusiasm, therefore, Maury made his preparations for\r\ndeparture to England. He was saddened by the necessity of parting\r\nfrom his family who had already begun to suffer from the fortunes of\r\nwar. They had been driven from their refuge in Fredericksburg when\r\nthat place was captured by Union troops on April 18, 1862, and on the\r\nfollowing 1st of June his son Richard had his horse shot from under\r\nhim in battle and was himself severely wounded. But obedient to the\r\ncall of duty, he bade farewell to his family who were then making their\r\nhome with relatives in Albemarle County and, with his youngest son,\r\nMatthew Fontaine, Jr., he set out for Charleston to take ship as soon\r\nas practicable for his new field of work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XII\r\n\r\n                 HIS PART IN THE CIVIL WAR: IN ENGLAND\r\n\r\n\r\nThough Maury arrived in Charleston the latter part of September, it was\r\nnot until October 12, 1862 that he departed with his twelve year old\r\nson “Brave” on board the steamer _Herald_ to run the Union blockade. An\r\nattempt had been made some three days before and had been unsuccessful,\r\nas the vessel had run into an enemy sloop of war and was forced to\r\nput back within the protection of the forts. The second trial was\r\nsuccessful, but it almost ended in disaster. “We crossed the bar once”,\r\nMaury wrote, “and when we got in about two miles of the enemy the\r\npilots plumped the ship ashore, where she lay all night. In the morning\r\nthey opened on her but she got off without damage”. Maury certainly\r\ncould not have looked upon capture with any feelings of pleasure, but\r\nto reassure his wife he wrote, before leaving Charleston, “If we get\r\ncaught, I expect soon to be exchanged. The Brave and I will have a\r\nbully time in prison”.\r\n\r\nNothing further of an unusual nature happened on the six hundred miles\r\nvoyage to the Bermudas except that Captain Louis M. Coxetter, who had\r\nnever before been very far from land, after groping about for the\r\nisland had to admit on the sixth day that he was lost.\r\n\r\nJames Morris Morgan, who as a midshipman accompanied Maury to England,\r\nthus relates how the great scientist extricated the captain from his\r\ndifficulty: “He (Coxetter) told Commodore Maury that something terrible\r\nmust have happened, as he had sailed his ship directly over the spot\r\nwhere the Bermuda Islands ought to be! Commodore Maury told him that\r\nhe could do nothing for him before ten o’clock that night and advised\r\nhim to slow down. At ten o’clock the great scientist and geographer\r\nwent on deck and took observations, at times lying flat on his back,\r\nsextant in hand, as he made measurements of the stars. When he had\r\nfinished his calculations, he gave the captain a course and told him\r\nthat by steering it at a certain speed he would sight the light at Port\r\nHamilton by two o’clock in the morning. No one turned into his bunk\r\nthat night except the Commodore and his little son; the rest of us were\r\ntoo anxious. Four bells struck and no light was in sight. Five minutes\r\nmore passed and still not a sign of it; then grumbling commenced, and\r\nthe passengers generally agreed with the man who expressed the opinion\r\nthat there was too much d...d science on board and that we should all\r\nbe on our way to Fort Lafayette in New York Harbor as soon as day\r\nbroke. At ten minutes past two the masthead lookout sang out, ‘Light\r\nho!’—and the learned old Commodore’s reputation as a navigator was\r\nsaved”.[16]\r\n\r\nFortunately Commodore Wilkes’s squadron, which had been hovering\r\nabout the islands and overhauling all the ships that passed, had just\r\ndeparted and the _Herald_ made her way unmolested into the harbor. Here\r\nMaury remained for more than two weeks, waiting for the Royal Mail\r\nSteamer _Delta_ from St. Thomas. During this time he was received as\r\na private citizen and world-renowned scientist by the governor of the\r\nislands, and was called upon by the commandant of Fort St. George and\r\nhonored with a dinner on board H. M. S. _Immortality_ then stationed at\r\nPort Hamilton.\r\n\r\nWhen the English ship sailed, she was followed to sea by the U. S.\r\nSloops of War _San Jacinto_ and _Mohican_ in a threatening manner as\r\nthough about to repeat the “Trent Affair” and take Maury from the\r\nvessel; but nothing of the sort materialized. At Halifax, where Maury\r\narrived November 9, he received the most distinguished consideration\r\nfrom the general commanding the troops, the admiral of the fleet, and\r\nthe governor of Nova Scotia. The Confederate flag was flown from the\r\ntop of the hotel in his honor, and the hand-organs ground “Dixie” under\r\nhis window all day.\r\n\r\nHere Maury’s party took passage, on November 13, on the Cunard Steamer\r\n_Arabia_, a paddlewheel full-rigged ship plying between Liverpool and\r\nBoston. The ship tumbled about considerably during a great part of the\r\nvoyage, and Maury was “as seasick and amiable as usual”. The voyage was\r\nuneventful, and Liverpool was reached in safety.\r\n\r\nOn arrival, Maury conferred with Captain James T. Bulloch, C. S. Navy,\r\nwho had an office with Fraser, Trenholm, and Company, the financial\r\nagents of the Confederate government, at No. 10 Rumford Place. After a\r\nshort stay in Liverpool, he went on to London to a house in Sackville\r\nStreet which had already been engaged for him, where, according to\r\nMorgan, “All day long there would be in front of the house a string\r\nof carriages with coronets on their doors, while their owners were\r\npaying their respects to the great ‘Lieutenant Maury’”. Early in 1863,\r\nMaury established himself at Bowdon, a village about nine miles from\r\nManchester, so that he could be near his son whom he had placed there\r\nin the Rose Hill School.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n  _From James Morris Morgan’s “Recollections of a Rebel Reefer.”_\r\n\r\n  C. S. CRUISER “GEORGIA”\r\n\r\n  Fitted out for the Confederate States by Maury in England]\r\n\r\nAt the time of Maury’s arrival in England, there were, it appears,\r\neight officers of the Confederate Navy in Europe, who were engaged\r\nin the task of securing by whatever means possible the much needed\r\nships for the Confederacy. Captain Samuel Barron, who had been sent\r\nover to command the ironclad rams at that time being built by Lairds\r\nat Liverpool, was the flag-officer and in actual command, though the\r\nduties and responsibilities of the various officers were not very\r\nclearly defined and often overlapped.\r\n\r\nMaury’s first accomplishment was the purchase, in March, 1863, of a new\r\niron screw-steamer of about 560 tons, which had just been completed\r\nat Dumbarton on the Clyde. She was fitted out as a merchant steamer\r\nunder the name of the _Japan_, and on April 1, set sail, pretending to\r\nbe bound for the East Indies. At about the same time a small steamer,\r\nthe _Alar_, cleared from New Haven for St. Malo with Commander William\r\nLewis Maury and a staff of officers together with guns, ammunition, and\r\nother supplies. The two ships met off Ushant, where the war material\r\nwas placed on board the larger vessel. Commander Maury, a cousin to M.\r\nF. Maury, then commissioned her a Confederate man-of-war with the name\r\n_Georgia_.\r\n\r\nThe ship at once began a cruise which lasted seven months and resulted\r\nin the capture of eight or nine vessels, amounting to a loss of\r\n$406,000. After cruising over the South Atlantic and calling at Bahia,\r\nBrazil, where she fell in with the _Alabama_, and at Capetown, she made\r\nher way in safety to Cherbourg, France, where she arrived during the\r\nnight of October 28–29. Here Commander Maury was detached because of\r\nill health, and the ship was refitted. But she was fated not to go out\r\non another cruise. The vessel was not adapted to the service for which\r\nshe was required; her coal capacity was limited and the consumption of\r\nfuel on her was made very large because she lacked great sail-power\r\nand always had to chase under steam. She did, however, slip out past\r\nthe Union ships on guard, and made her way to the Mediterranean to a\r\nrendezvous with the C. S. S. _Rappahannock_ on the coast of Morocco.\r\nHere her battery, ammunition, and a part of her crew were to be\r\ntransferred to the other vessel, and she was then to be sold. But\r\nthe French kept such a close watch on the _Rappahannock_ that she\r\nwas not able to leave the harbor of Calais, and the _Georgia_ was at\r\nlast forced to turn about and make her way to Bordeaux. She was then\r\nordered to Liverpool, where on the 10th of May, 1864, she was put out\r\nof commission and sold to an Englishman by the name of Edward Bates\r\nfor about 15,000 pounds. She was then captured in August of that year\r\nby Captain T. T. Craven of the U. S. S. _Niagara_, and sent to Boston,\r\nwhere she was condemned; and afterwards the owner’s claim for damages\r\nwas disallowed by the Mixed Commission at Washington.\r\n\r\nMaury was instructed by the Secretary of the Navy, on June 8, 1863, to\r\npurchase another ship. This order, however, did not reach him until\r\ntwo months afterwards, and he was not able to carry it out until the\r\nmonth of November, when he secured a condemned dispatch boat belonging\r\nto the Royal Navy. This was the _Victor_, a screw-steamer of about 500\r\ntons which had been offered for sale at Sheerness. For fear of being\r\nstopped, Maury hurried her to sea on the wintry night of November 24,\r\nwith workmen still on board and with only a few of her intended crew.\r\nHer officers joined her in the Channel, where she was commissioned\r\nthe _Rappahannock_. Two days later she entered the harbor of Calais\r\nunder the guise of a Confederate ship in distress. Here the French\r\nthrew such restrictions about her as to prevent her from even making\r\nan attempt to leave port. Some endeavors were made to sell the vessel,\r\nbut the war came to an end before this could be accomplished and the\r\nship was eventually turned over to the United States. Her commanding\r\nofficer had considered her a poor ship for commerce destroying, because\r\nher machinery took up too much space and her magazine was so large as\r\nto leave but little room for crew and provisions. The ship was often\r\nreferred to as “The Confederate White Elephant”, but she did serve the\r\nvery useful purpose of keeping two United States war vessels constantly\r\noff Calais to prevent her from going to sea.\r\n\r\nMaury and the other Confederate agents had great obstacles to meet\r\nin securing ships, and probably did as well as possible under the\r\ncircumstances. Federal agents were constantly on the watch to see that\r\nFrench and British neutrality was strictly observed, and besides Maury\r\nand his associates were greatly handicapped by the lack of money for\r\nthe purchase of vessels and the insufficiency of both officers and\r\ntheir crews. “If I had had money and officers”, wrote Maury, “I could\r\nsince I have been here have fitted out half a dozen just as good to\r\nprey upon the Yankee commerce as the _Alabama_”.\r\n\r\nMaury also had a hand in the attempt to have two ironclad rams\r\nconstructed in a French port for the Confederate government, one of\r\nwhich he hoped to have the privilege of commanding. The specifications\r\nfor such vessels were these: ability to cross the Atlantic, hulls of\r\nwood and iron with two armored turrets, engines of 300 horsepower which\r\nwould give great momentum and a speed of fifteen or sixteen knots, two\r\ntwin screw propellers, and a draft of fifteen feet. His general plan\r\nand the cost of construction were approved by Secretary Mallory, and\r\non July 16, 1863 the contract was signed between Bulloch and L. Arman,\r\na naval constructor at Bordeaux, for the building of the two steam\r\nrams. But these ships of war were destined never to be finished for\r\nthe Confederacy, for the turn of events in America and the attitude\r\nof Great Britain caused the Emperor Napoleon to shift his position\r\ndiplomatically and maintain a strict neutrality, though at one time,\r\naccording to Maury’s diary, the Emperor had written to Arman for a\r\ndescription of the guns with which the rams were to be armed in order\r\nthat the French government might superintend their fabrication, and\r\ntest them to see if they were properly constructed.\r\n\r\nMaury was engaged in other activities in England and on the Continent\r\nwhich were altogether political in their nature. He had a European\r\nreputation for his literary and scientific attainments, and was\r\npeculiarly well qualified to bring the Southern version of the causes,\r\nprogress, and probable outcome of the war before an influential class\r\nof people. Upon his arrival in England he began at once to exert this\r\ninfluence, both privately and publicly. As an example of the latter\r\nform of propaganda was a letter which he addressed to the editor of\r\nthe London _Times_. This appeared in that newspaper on December 22,\r\n1862, and set forth a sanguine account of conditions in the South as\r\nhe had recently seen them, and sought to impress upon the British the\r\nhopefulness of the Southern cause.\r\n\r\nOn October 7 of that year, Gladstone, the Chancellor of the Exchequer,\r\nhad said at a banquet at Newcastle, “There is no doubt that Jefferson\r\nDavis and other leaders of the South have made an army; they are\r\nmaking, it appears, a navy; and they have made, what is more than\r\neither—they have made a nation”. The speech caused a sensation, and\r\nwas received with cheers. “We may anticipate”, he also declared, “with\r\ncertainty the success of the Southern States so far as their separation\r\nfrom the North is concerned”.[17] Maury had reason, therefore, for\r\nbeing at first very hopeful of European recognition and intervention,\r\nand was not merely drawing on his imagination when he wrote, “The\r\nEmperor may, and I hope will, decide on recognition and there are hopes\r\nhere that when Parliament meets, February 5, the British government may\r\nfind itself compelled to do something”.\r\n\r\nIn a short time, however, his eyes began to be opened, and he saw\r\nthat, though great admiration was expressed for the bravery of the\r\nsoldiers and the heroism of the women of the South, such sympathy was\r\nmore apparent than real and was confined mostly to the upper classes.\r\nHe began to realize that, since 1850, a million and a half had gone\r\nfrom the English middle class and settled in the North, and that their\r\nrelatives and friends at home naturally sympathized with that section\r\nin the war.\r\n\r\nToward the close of the year 1863, Maury drew up a “Recast of\r\nResolutions, etc.” for a Southern sympathizer, the Reverend Dr.\r\nTremlett, of London, and for his 2000 parishioners, the purpose of\r\nwhich was the organization of a society to encourage remonstrance\r\nagainst the war. This developed into the “Society for Obtaining the\r\nCessation of Hostilities in America”, which was very active during the\r\nyear 1864. It had its headquarters at 215 Regent Street, London, and\r\nnumbered among its officers and members many very influential persons.\r\nLeaflets and pamphlets were drawn up and distributed, which called upon\r\nthe participants to bring the strife and bloodshed, the misery and\r\nsuffering to a close. Many of these petitions were read in the churches\r\nof both Ireland and England, and signatures representing several\r\nmillions of British people were secured. By that time, however, the war\r\nhad advanced to that stage in which no such petitions could affect the\r\nNorth and only the complete collapse of the Confederacy would bring the\r\nstruggle to an end.\r\n\r\nIn addition to this work as a propagandist which was carried on more\r\nor less in the open, Maury was also concerned in political intrigues\r\nwith the Emperor Napoleon and Maximilian of Austria. These matters\r\nwere veiled in secrecy, of course; and it is difficult to determine,\r\nat this late day, the exact extent of Maury’s operations. But there\r\nis evidence that it was very considerable. Napoleon had succeeded in\r\nconquering Mexico, and the crown had been offered to the Archduke\r\nMaximilian of Austria. Maury, who in the old days in Washington had had\r\ncorrespondence with this Austrian prince, thought the time opportune\r\nto write to him concerning a scheme which he thought might be greatly\r\nto the advantage of both Mexico and the Confederacy. The plan was the\r\noffer of assistance in the separation of California from the Union\r\nand its restoration to Mexico. Maury hoped that, in this way, foreign\r\ncomplications would arise, which would result in European intervention\r\nthat would bring the war to a close.\r\n\r\nAt first, the scheme was received with great favor by Maximilian.\r\nMeanwhile, Napoleon changed his mind concerning any plan he may have\r\nonce had for the recognition of the Confederacy and intervention in\r\nher behalf, probably because of England’s repeated refusals to join\r\nwith him in any such action. As Bulloch says, “The invitation to build\r\nships in France was given during the period of successful resistance\r\nat the South, and of apparent doubt and trepidation at the North. It\r\nwas withdrawn when force of numbers and immeasurable superiority in\r\nwar material began to prevail, and when aid and encouragement was most\r\nneeded by the weaker side. It suited the Imperial policy, and appeared\r\nto be consistent with the designs upon Mexico, to extend a clandestine\r\nsupport to the South when the Confederate armies were still strong and\r\nexultant”.[18] Accordingly, when Maximilian visited the Emperor in\r\nParis to consult in regard to his acceptance of the Mexican throne,\r\nhe was persuaded by Napoleon to give up his plan of recognizing the\r\nConfederacy and entering into intimate relations with that government;\r\nand he did not receive Slidell, the Confederate representative, in\r\nParis, as he had fully expected to do. Nothing further came of Maury’s\r\nplan. Maximilian was proclaimed Emperor of Mexico by a deputation from\r\nthat country at the Archduke’s palace at Mirarmar on the Adriatic, on\r\nApril 10, 1864; and on the 15th of that month he embarked for Vera\r\nCruz, without making any further advances toward the Confederacy.\r\n\r\nSo much, then, for Maury’s endeavors to secure ships of war for the\r\nConfederacy, his work as a propagandist, and his political intrigues.\r\nBut a fourth activity of his remains to be considered. This had to do\r\nwith experiments with electric mines,—a continuation of that pioneer\r\nwork in this field which he had commenced in Richmond early in the\r\nwar. It has often been stated that this was the primary object of his\r\nmission to England; but certainly neither his correspondence nor his\r\ndiary, which was begun at Bowdon on April 27, 1863, not very long after\r\nhis arrival abroad, bear out this impression. The fact is, that not\r\nuntil after the comparative failure of his other plans and projects did\r\nMaury devote much time and attention to these experiments. Then from\r\nJuly, 1864 up to the time of his departure from England the following\r\nspring, everything indicates that his mind was absorbed with the\r\nelectric mine.\r\n\r\nIt was not the fault of Maury, however, that this weapon was not more\r\nquickly developed, and used more effectively in the war. “I saw”, he\r\nbitterly complained in one of his letters, “that he did spring at\r\nleast one mine on Farragut’s ships (in the Battle of Mobile Bay). It\r\nis so strange to me that sensible men will require to see ship after\r\nship blown up before they will have faith in submarine mining. Don’t\r\nyou remember some drawings that cousin John was making for me in the\r\nfall or winter of 1861? That was a plan for mining our channel ways,\r\nand our authorities have not yet faith in it to make of it a regular\r\norganized system of defense”. Even as late as November, 1864 he wrote\r\nin his diary: “The question may be asked why I do not hasten home with\r\nthis information and knowledge? Who—for Davis and Mallory are bitter\r\nenemies—will believe my report? The importance of a navy and the value\r\nof submarine mining were urged upon them by me from the beginning.\r\nMoreover, I have written both the Secretary of War and the Secretary\r\nof the Navy urging these things, and here I am ordered to lie. Another\r\nthing, since the whole field is so new I can be of more service here\r\nin traversing and exhausting it with experiments where mechanical\r\nfacilities and appliances are so abundant. I report results as fast\r\nas I obtain them and in a manner, as to circumstances and details, so\r\nminute that they may be brought into play as well as though I were\r\nthere. Finally, I think it best since so it must be”.\r\n\r\nThe results of Maury’s experiments in the electric mine while in\r\nEngland are embodied in the following agreement, made April 11, 1865\r\nwith an English electrical engineer as agent: “My dear Sir,—My own\r\nexperiments show that the electrical torpedo or mine has not hitherto\r\nbeen properly appreciated as a means of defense in war. It is as\r\neffective for the defense as ironclads and rifled guns are for the\r\nattack. Indeed, such is the progress made in what may be called the new\r\ndepartment of military engineering that I feel justified in the opinion\r\nthat hereafter in all plans for coast, harbor, and river defenses and\r\nin all works for the protection of cities and places whether against\r\nthe attack by armies on land or ships afloat, the electrical torpedo\r\nis to play an important part. It will not only modify and strengthen\r\nexisting plans but greatly reduce the expense of future systems.\r\nThese experiments have resulted in some important improvements and\r\ncontrivances, not to say inventions and discoveries, which have been\r\nfully made known to you verbally. The communication was confidential\r\nand for the purpose of making you a party interested in bringing the\r\nsubject into proper notice. It was also verbally agreed that you should\r\nundertake to negotiate with certain powers for the adoption of this new\r\nsystem of defense as improved by me and grants made therefor should be\r\nshared between us, I receiving one half of the full amount so granted\r\nwithout charge or deduction of any sort.\r\n\r\n“The only restrictions placed upon you in this matter are: 1. The\r\nenemies of my country are not for any consideration whatever to have\r\nthe benefits of these improvements. On the contrary, on making them\r\nknown to others, you are to make them known in confidence and with\r\na clause in the agreement especially providing against publicity\r\nand stipulating that the plan shall not be made known to any Yankee\r\nor his government. 2. I had already offered to H. I. H. Grand Duke\r\nConstantine, as a token of acknowledgment for his great kindness and\r\nfriendly consideration shown me and mine, when this war broke out, to\r\nplace all these my discoveries and improvements at his feet and for\r\nthe use of his government. I have referred him to you as my confidant\r\nand friend who is fully prepared to carry out my plans in all their\r\ndetails, or who will explain them in confidence to any person he may\r\nappoint. You are to make no charge, therefore, for imparting this\r\ninformation, at his request, and should he or his government think\r\nproper to offer me an honorarium, it is not to be shared by you. 3.\r\nMy friend, Captain M. Jansen of the Dutch Navy who resides at Delft,\r\nhas assisted me in a part of these experiments. We are as brothers.\r\nAll that I have done is known to him and he has the authority to use\r\nthe information acquired for his own government, provided he may be\r\npersonally benefited thereby. The restriction here is, that should you\r\ndeem it worth while to bring the subject before the Dutch government\r\nyou will first confer with Captain Jansen and shape your course\r\naccordingly. Should you effect a negotiation there, please turn over to\r\nhim my share of the Dutch grant. 4. I restrict you also as to Mexico.\r\nLeave that to me. Should, however, any negotiation be entered into with\r\nthat government, I shall refer the authorities to you for the articles\r\nsuch as wire, etc. required.\r\n\r\n“Such in substance is our verbal understanding. But as I am about to\r\nleave England, it becomes proper, for more reasons than one, that we\r\nshould make a memorandum of agreement in writing, to the end of making\r\nit good in law and binding also upon our heirs and assigns. With this\r\nview, this writing is drawn and the following statement is added.\r\nThe points upon which this system hangs and which give special value\r\nto the information imparted to you concerning it are mainly these:\r\n1. A plan for determining by cross bearings when the enemy is in the\r\ntorpedo field of destruction and for ‘making connections’ among the\r\ntorpedo wires in a certain way and by which the concurrence of each\r\nof two operators becomes necessary for the explosion of any one or\r\nmore torpedoes. This plan requires each operator to be so placed or\r\nstationed that a line drawn straight from them to the place of the\r\ntorpedoes may intersect as nearly as practicable at right angles. And\r\nit requires the connection to be such that each operator may put his\r\nstation in or out of circuit at will. When the torpedoes are laid, a\r\nrange for each station is established for every torpedo or group of\r\ntorpedoes. When either operator observes an enemy in range with any\r\ntorpedo, he closes his circuit for that torpedo. If the enemy before\r\ngetting out of this range should enter the range for any torpedo\r\nfrom the other station, the operator there closes his circuit and\r\ndischarges the igniting spark. Consequently, if the ranges belong to\r\nthe same torpedo, its explosion takes place. But if not, there will be\r\nno explosion. Hence, here is an artifice by which explosion becomes\r\nimpossible when the enemy is not in the field of destruction and sure\r\nwhen she is. 2. The Electrical Gauge, a contrivance of my own which you\r\nperfectly understand and some of which you have already made; by means\r\nof it one of the tests which the igniting fuse has to undergo before\r\nit is accepted is applied. By means of it, the operators can telegraph\r\nthrough the fuse to each other without risk to the torpedoes and by\r\nwhich the torpedoes may without detriment to their explosibility be\r\ntested daily or as often as required. And thus the operators can at all\r\ntimes make sure that all is right. 3. A plan for planting torpedoes\r\nwhere the water is too deep for them to lie on the bottom and explode\r\nwith effect, by which they will not interfere with the navigation\r\nof the channels and by which, when the enemy makes his appearance,\r\nthey may by the touch of a key be brought instantly into the required\r\nposition at the required depth. These contrivances are very simple.\r\nThey are readily understood from verbal description. They require\r\nneither models nor drawings for illustration. You understand them all.\r\nThey are of little or no value except to governments and, as against\r\nthese letters of patent are of no use, I have not deemed letters patent\r\ndesirable. I have every confidence in you and therefore intrust the\r\nwhole secret to your keeping and discretion. Having thus placed myself\r\nin your hands, let us make this agreement binding also upon our heirs\r\nand assigns, and to this end I propose that the necessary steps be at\r\nonce taken. Yours truly, M. F. Maury, Confederate Navy. To Nath. J.\r\nHolmes, Esq.”\r\n\r\nMaury had at this time fully decided to return to the Confederate\r\nStates in the spring, and was then arranging his affairs in England\r\nwith that end in view. He hoped to arrive there early enough to make\r\nuse of his electric mines in the land warfare of the spring campaign.\r\nHe had recently undergone a surgical operation, and his friends in\r\nEngland were very much opposed to his going home, some of them being\r\nof the opinion that by the time he arrived Richmond would have been\r\nabandoned and he would have no home to go to. But he conceived it to be\r\nhis duty to return, as he might be of greater service there than he was\r\nabroad.\r\n\r\nBefore the date he had set for sailing, May 2, Lee had surrendered\r\nat Appomattox and Lincoln had been assassinated; still Maury did not\r\nchange his plans, but sailed on the Royal Mail Steamer _Atrato_ with a\r\nquantity of insulated wire, copper tanks, magnetic exploders, etc. for\r\nHavana with the hope of being able to keep open Galveston or some other\r\nport on the coast of Texas.\r\n\r\nHe had worried a great deal about the members of his family who were in\r\nthe Confederate service. “My dreams”, he wrote in January, 1863, “are\r\nnightly of death and mutilation of children and friends”. Just four\r\ndays after this date his son John, who was at Vicksburg on the staff of\r\nGeneral Dabney H. Maury, disappeared while reconnoitering the enemy\r\nalone, and was never heard of again.[19] News of this unfortunate event\r\ndid not reach the father until April 8, 1863, and soon afterwards he\r\nwrote as follows on the evils of war: “War is a great scourge, and this\r\nhas touched you and me and many a good fellow with a heavy hand. As I\r\nlook out upon the landscape that lies before my window, and see the\r\nmen and women working in the fields, and the fields smiling to man’s\r\nhusbandry, when I see no marks of the spoiler, and recognize that each\r\none is safe in his person and secure in his possessions, then it is\r\nI see peace, and think of my poor country with a sigh, and, oh, with\r\nwhat reflections. ‘Thoughts on thoughts a countless throng’, bless\r\nyour hearts—you and John—for comforting, with so much solicitude and\r\naffection, my poor dear wife in her affliction! Good brothers are you\r\nboth. How lovely and beautiful are the memories of my Johnny! I wonder\r\nif all parents think of their dead as I do of mine. Bless that sleeping\r\nboy! Never did he, in his whole life, do one single act that either\r\ndispleased or grieved me or his mother. ‘He never offended’. What an\r\nepitaph; and how proudly I write it! But where is the end of this war\r\nto find us—where you and yours, me and mine, and where so many that\r\nare dear and near to us? Our charming circle of relations is, I fear,\r\nbroken up, never, never to be restored on this side of the grave”.\r\n\r\nHis family had been made refugees three different times, and Maury had\r\nbeen much concerned over their needs and probable sufferings. He wrote\r\nin the summer of 1864 to Dr. Tremlett from the Duke of Buckingham’s\r\npalace at Stow, “I had a letter to-day of May 7th from my daughter\r\nNannie, and she says, ‘Flour has gone to $100 per barrel—too high for\r\nus—but meal is cheaper, thank God!’... ‘We had for dinner to-day soup\r\nmade out of nothing, and afterwards a shin. ’Twas good, I tell you; we\r\nall dote on shins’. And again, from my little Lucy, ‘Ham and mashed\r\npotatoes to-day for dinner; and, as it was my birthday (9th May), Mamma\r\nsaid I might eat as much as I wanted’. Here, you see, there is no\r\ncomplaining, but only a gentle lifting of the curtain, which in their\r\ndevotion and solicitude they have kept so closely drawn before me. With\r\nthis pitiful picture in my mind’s eye, I felt as if I must choke with\r\nthe sumptuous viands set before me on the Duke’s table. Alas, my little\r\ninnocents!”\r\n\r\nSo it was with a heavy heart and the future all dark that he and his\r\nyoung son set sail, after an absence of more than two years, for\r\nhome,—the home which Maury himself was not to see until several more\r\nyears of exile had been spent in foreign lands.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\n                       WITH MAXIMILIAN IN MEXICO\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Maury reached St. Thomas in the West Indies, about the middle of\r\nMay, 1865, he learned from the newspapers that the Confederacy had\r\ncompletely collapsed, but he continued his voyage to Havana. From here\r\nhis son Matthew, Jr. was sent on home to Virginia; while Maury himself\r\nwaited to consider what was best for him to do—an old man now broken\r\nin health and ruined in finances, separated from family and friends,\r\nand without home or country.\r\n\r\nThough he had saved practically nothing from the wreck of his financial\r\nfortunes, caused by the war, yet his sterling honesty would not permit\r\nhim to sell the torpedo material and appropriate the money, to which\r\nhe then had as good a right as any other individual. His conduct of\r\nthe affairs of the Confederacy in England had been marked with this\r\nsame scrupulous honesty, in the expenditure of nearly $400,000. Before\r\nleaving that country, all the vouchers for that sum were turned over\r\nto Bulloch, correct to a figure, as attested by the following letter:\r\n“Neither can I close this, perhaps my last letter on business matters,\r\nwithout observing that although the custom here would have sanctioned\r\nyour receiving a large _per centum_ in the way of commission on\r\ncontracts, purchases, and disbursements made by me, yet you constantly\r\nset your face against it and never to my certain knowledge received one\r\nshilling”.\r\n\r\nMaury came out of the war, with no money but with a clear conscience.\r\n“I left”, he wrote his wife, “$30,000 or $40,000 worth of torpedoes,\r\ntelegraphic wire, etc. which I bought for the defense of Richmond.\r\nBulloch paid for them but they were left in Havana at the breakup,\r\nsubject to my orders. I write by this mail directing that they be\r\nturned over to Bulloch. Now they don’t belong to him, neither do they\r\nto me. But it is quite a relief to get rid of them by transferring them\r\nto a man who I am sure will make the most proper use of them. I did not\r\nwant any of the $10,000 or $20,000 which they will bring, though some\r\none will get it who has no more right to it than I have”.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n  MAURY HALL, UNITED STATES NAVAL ACADEMY, NAMED IN HONOR OF MAURY]\r\n\r\nNow that Virginia had laid down her arms, Maury thought it proper\r\nto write a formal surrender of his sword. He accordingly sent the\r\nfollowing letter to the officer in command of the United States naval\r\nforces in the Gulf of Mexico: “In peace as in war I follow the fortunes\r\nof my native old state (Virginia). I read in the public prints that she\r\nhas practically confessed defeat and laid down her arms. In that act\r\nmine were grounded also. I am here without command, officially alone,\r\nand am bound on matters of private concern abroad. Nevertheless, and\r\nas I consider further resistance worse than useless, I deem it proper\r\nformally so to confess, and to pledge you in the words of honor that,\r\nshould I find myself before the final inauguration of peace within\r\nthe jurisdiction of the United States, to consider myself a prisoner\r\nof war, bound by the terms and conditions which have been or may be\r\ngranted to General Lee and his officers. Be pleased to send your\r\nanswer through my son (Colonel R. L. Maury), a prisoner of war on\r\nparole in Richmond. In the meantime, and until I hear to the contrary,\r\nI shall act as though my surrender had been formally accepted on the\r\nabove-named terms and conditions”.\r\n\r\nThe status of Confederate agents abroad, at the close of the war, was\r\na very precarious one. As Bulloch writes, “The civil as well as the\r\nmilitary and naval representatives of the Confederate States abroad\r\nwere excluded from ‘pardon’, under the so-called Amnesty Proclamations,\r\nwhich were issued immediately after the war, and none of them could\r\nhave returned to the United States without the certainty of arrest,\r\nimprisonment, or, under the most favorable circumstances, the\r\nalternative of taking what has not been inaptly called the ‘iron-clad\r\noath’”.[20]\r\n\r\nAll of Maury’s friends were united in advising him not to return to\r\nthe United States until the feeling in the North should become less\r\nhostile. “Do not come home”, wrote his daughter, “General Lee told me\r\nthe other day to tell you not to”. It was their opinion that his letter\r\nof surrender would not place him under General Lee’s parole, because\r\nof the association of his name with the fitting out of Confederate\r\nprivateers, and that he would be arrested immediately upon his arrival.\r\nHis brother-in-law, Dr. Brodie Herndon, wrote him a long letter, giving\r\nhim information concerning the family and the future of Virginia, and\r\nadvised him not to return for the present. “In view of the state of\r\nthe public mind in the North at present”, he wrote, “I think it would\r\nbe decidedly unsafe for you to return to this country. Your absence\r\nabroad in a semi-diplomatic character, your prominence, and the earnest\r\npart taken by you in the cause, would make you a decided object of\r\nthat ‘vengeance against leaders’ so openly proclaimed and so plainly\r\nvisible. In time, I hope, these vindictive feelings will subside, and\r\nthen, and only then, would it be safe and prudent for you to return”.\r\n\r\nBefore any of this advice could reach him, Maury made his decision as\r\nto the course he thought would be best for him to pursue. This was to\r\ngo to Mexico and take service under Maximilian. Even before leaving\r\nEngland, he had considered this as a possible eventuality, and had\r\nwritten to his friend Jansen about the possibilities of a colonization\r\nscheme in Mexico. Furthermore, this item in his diary, written while at\r\nsea on his way to the West Indies, shows that the plan was then in his\r\nmind: “Secession has failed, I fear, and noble old Virginia is about to\r\npass _sub jugum_, all owing to the President who, not being a statesman\r\nhimself or a judge of one to call statesmen around him, has sacrificed\r\nour sons, our fortunes, and country. At least, so I fear. Where I am\r\nbound events will determine. I follow the fortunes of Virginia. If she\r\nsuccumbs, I shall expatriate myself, I think. Events alone will decide\r\nmy course. Hey ho!” Before his arrival in Cuba, he had made up his\r\nmind. In a letter to Dr. Tremlett, written off San Domingo, he declared\r\nthat he expected to go to Mexico to arrange for emigration from\r\nVirginia and other Southern states. “If Max. is wise”, he continued,\r\n“and will encourage my plans I can assist mightily to make firm the\r\nfoundations of his dynasty.”\r\n\r\nIt was natural that Maury’s thoughts should have turned to Maximilian.\r\nBefore the war, he had sent to the Archduke, then Commander in Chief\r\nof the Imperial Royal Austrian Marine, a complete set of his “Sailing\r\nDirections”; and it was through Maximilian’s hands that the Austrian\r\ngold medal of arts and sciences was conferred on him. Two years later\r\n(June 6, 1860) he wrote Maury, enclosing the meteorological diary\r\nwhich had been kept on board the _Elizabeth_ on a voyage to South\r\nAmerica. These marks of the Archduke’s favor, together with Maury’s\r\nmore recent correspondence concerning the possible coöperation of the\r\nSouthern Confederacy and the new Empire of Mexico, fully warranted\r\nMaury’s confidence in believing that he might not do better at this\r\ncrisis in his affairs than to go to Mexico and serve under Maximilian.\r\n\r\nBy the first of May, 1865, Maury had reached Vera Cruz. From here he\r\nwent to Mexico City and wrote to General de la Peza, Minister of War,\r\noffering to demonstrate his electric torpedoes to him confidentially.\r\nSoon thereafter he offered his services to Maximilian, and was warmly\r\nwelcomed by the Emperor and the Empress Carlotta. He at once laid\r\nbefore them his immigration scheme, which was very favorably received.\r\nBy the first of August, the Emperor had decided to try the plan, and\r\nappointed Maury to the office of Imperial Commissioner of Colonization,\r\nwith a salary of $5000 a year. In addition to this, he was made on\r\nSeptember 23 the Director of the Astronomical Observatory.\r\n\r\nNone of Maury’s family was pleased with his going to Mexico, because of\r\nthe uncertainty of Maximilian’s throne, and would have preferred him to\r\nreturn to England or even to go to Russia or Brazil. His friends were\r\nof the same opinion. “The people of Virginia”, wrote Captain Jansen,\r\n“have shown themselves to be as brave as any people ever have been;\r\nbut courage is coupled, in patriotism, with perseverance in suffering\r\nuntil better times come for Virginia. All who love her for what she\r\nhas done ought to love her enough to suffer with her and for her\r\nsake. If the best people who have made Virginia what she is desert\r\nher at this critical moment, it would be like children leaving their\r\nmother in distress. There is no virtue without sacrifice, and, if the\r\nVirginians possess the virtue of patriotism, they ought to bring her\r\nnow the sacrifice of pride. Don’t emigrate! Stand by your country with\r\nstern courage; learn the patience to bear without shame and with all\r\nthe dignity of self-command.... I don’t think you can now return to\r\nVirginia; but in three or four years great changes will take place in\r\nopinions, and you nor your family won’t find a country which would be\r\nable to give you anything like her sympathy, or to take Virginia out of\r\nyour hearts and souls. You ought to go back to your dear state as soon\r\nas you can do so safely; and if you had followed my advice you would\r\nnever have left England, but would have asked Madame Maury to join you\r\nthere. After a long journey and great inconveniences, perhaps suffering\r\nin your health and mind, you’ll come back without gaining anything but\r\na sad experience”. A month later the same friend wrote, “As long as\r\nMax. tries to make what is called a civilized government, his position\r\nis unstable and I should not like you to stay there, how sweet and\r\npleasant it may be in the shade of an Emperor’s crown. But if he starts\r\non an Eastern policy and succeeds, you may run the chance as his prime\r\nminister to become a prince of the empire, or to be hung or shot or\r\nsomething worse”.\r\n\r\nGeneral Lee also advised Maury against his Mexican scheme. “We have\r\ncertainly not”, he declared, “found our form of government all that\r\nwas anticipated by its original founders; but this may be partly our\r\nfault in expecting too much, and partly due to the absence of virtue\r\nin the people. As long as virtue was dominant in the Republic, so\r\nlong was the happiness of the people secure. I cannot, however,\r\ndespair of it yet; I look forward to better days, and trust that time\r\nand experience—the great teachers of men under the guidance of our\r\never-merciful God—may save us from destruction, and restore to us the\r\nbright hopes and prospects of the past. The thought of abandoning the\r\ncountry, and all that must be left in it, is abhorrent to my feelings,\r\nand I prefer to struggle for its restoration, and share its fate rather\r\nthan to give up all as lost. I have a great admiration for Mexico:\r\nthe salubrity of its climate, the fertility of its soil, and the\r\nmagnificence of its scenery, possess for me great charms; but I still\r\nlook with delight upon the mountains of my native state. To remove our\r\npeople to a portion of Mexico which would be favorable to them would\r\nbe a work of much difficulty. Did they possess the means, and could\r\nthe system of apprenticeship you suggest be established, the United\r\nStates government would, I think, certainly interfere; and, under the\r\ncircumstances, there would be difficulty in persuading the free men to\r\nemigrate. Those citizens who can leave the country, and others who may\r\nbe compelled to do so, will reap the fruits of your considerate labors;\r\nbut I shall be very sorry if your presence will be lost to Virginia.\r\nShe has now sore need of all her sons, and can ill afford to lose you.\r\nI am very much obliged to you for all you have done for us, and hope\r\nyour labors in the future may be as efficacious as in the past, and\r\nthat your separation from us may not be permanent. Wishing you every\r\nprosperity and happiness, I am, Most truly yours, R. E. Lee”.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, this advice from his friends did not reach Maury until\r\nafter he had committed himself to the scheme. He was not the type of\r\nman who might have sat with hands folded in Havana, waiting for some\r\none to offer him a position. Knowing that it would not be wise for him\r\nto return to Virginia at that time, and feeling the responsibility of\r\nhaving a family dependent upon him for support, he pursued the course\r\nwhich seemed to him wisest under the circumstances. If he had been in\r\nVirginia at the close of the war, and had been in immediate touch with\r\nthe situation there and known the attitude of the people toward their\r\nfuture prospects, he would almost certainly have been in agreement with\r\nthe views of General Lee, and other friends and relatives.\r\n\r\nMaury, accordingly went forward with his plan, the main features of\r\nwhich are embodied in the following decree which Maximilian issued on\r\nSeptember 5, 1865: “We, Maximilian, Emperor of Mexico, in consideration\r\nof the sparseness of the population in the Mexican territory, in\r\nproportion to its extent, desiring to give to immigrants all possible\r\nsecurity for property and liberty and having heard the opinion of our\r\nBoard of Colonization, do decree as follows:\r\n\r\nArticle 1. Mexico is open to immigrants of all nations.\r\n\r\nArticle 2. Immigration agents shall be appointed, whose duty it will\r\nbe to protect the arrival of immigrants, install them on the lands\r\nassigned them, and assist them in every possible way in establishing\r\nthemselves. These agents will receive the orders of the Imperial\r\nCommissioner of Immigration, especially appointed by us, and to whom\r\nall the communications relative to immigration shall be addressed.\r\n\r\nArticle 3. Each immigrant shall receive a duly executed title,\r\nincommutable, of landed estate, and a certificate that it is free of\r\nmortgage.\r\n\r\nArticle 4. Such property shall be free from taxes for the first year,\r\nand also from duties on transfers of property, but only on the first\r\nsale.\r\n\r\nArticle 5. The immigrants may be naturalized as soon as they shall have\r\nestablished themselves as settlers.\r\n\r\nArticle 6. Immigrants who may desire to bring laborers with them, or\r\ninduce them to come in considerable numbers, of any race whatever, are\r\nauthorized to do so; but those laborers will be subject to special\r\nprotective regulations.\r\n\r\nArticle 7. The effects of immigrants, their working and brood animals,\r\nseeds, agricultural implements, machines, and working tools, will enter\r\nfree of custom-house and transit duties.\r\n\r\nArticle 8. Immigrants are exempted from military service for five\r\nyears. But they will form a stationary militia for the purpose of\r\nprotecting their property and neighborhoods.\r\n\r\nArticle 9. Liberty in the exercise of their respective forms of\r\nreligious worship is secured to immigrants by the organic law of the\r\nEmpire.\r\n\r\nArticle 10. Each of our Ministers is charged with carrying out such\r\nparts of this Decree as relate to his department”.\r\n\r\nMaury prepared a memorandum to accompany the decree, a set of\r\nregulations forty-two in number, and some general remarks on\r\nthe mineral wealth, climate, general geographical features, and\r\nagricultural opportunities to be found in Mexico. The immigrants were\r\nto be divided into two classes: Class A were those who had lost\r\nall in the war, while Class B were those who were not in straitened\r\ncircumstances. The first class were to receive a free passage to\r\nMexico and fare at the rate of a _real_ a mile to certain lands of the\r\npublic domain which had not as yet been under cultivation, 160 acres\r\nto be allotted to a single man and 320 to a man with a family “with\r\npre-emption right to as much more in each case”. The other class were\r\nto buy lands from the government, which had been more or less under\r\ncultivation, and also private haciendas, both at about one dollar per\r\nacre.\r\n\r\nThat Maury enjoyed the utmost confidence and respect of the Emperor\r\nand Empress is revealed in this letter referring to his treatment at\r\nthe palace of Chepultepec: “There were present the Empress, and one\r\nof her ladies, four German naval officers, and a Mexican—all were\r\nof his household, I believe. It was mail-day for Europe; the Emperor\r\nhad been busy at the palace writing, he told me, seventeen letters\r\nfor the steamer. I got there a moment before he did, so he went into\r\nthe sitting-room which joins the Empress’s chamber. He opened her\r\nchamber-door and said, ‘Carlotta, here’s Mr. Maury’. She came out\r\nimmediately and commanded me to be seated, the Emperor and the other\r\ngentlemen standing. Presently her lady-in-waiting came in; I rose, but\r\nshe touched me gently on the arm and said, ‘The Emperor wishes you\r\nalways to be seated’. The lady stood also. In a few minutes dinner was\r\nannounced. The Emperor led off, and we all followed in single file.\r\nAs I passed through the door, one of the aids—a baron—whispered in\r\nmy ear, ‘On the Emperor’s left’. The dinner—excepting the wines, the\r\nnumber of servants, and the liveries—reminded me very much of those\r\nLucy Ellen (Mrs. Maury’s sister-in-law) used to give us in our summer\r\nvisits to Fredericksburg.\r\n\r\n“After dinner—say three-quarters of an hour—we, the gentlemen, led\r\nby the Emperor, went into the smoking-room. Gilt cigars were handed\r\nround; the Emperor did not smoke. Here he drew an armchair up into the\r\ncorner, and seated me again, he and the others standing until their\r\ncigars were nearly finished. Then he took a seat, and commanded the\r\nothers to be seated. Dispatches were handed him, some of which he\r\nhanded to me to look into. Presently he dismissed the gentlemen, and\r\nsaid, ‘Mr. Maury, you have something to say to me?’ ‘Yes, sire; I can’t\r\nmanage immigration through the Ministers. I must transact business with\r\nyou directly, and not through them; nor must they have anything to do\r\nwith it’. ‘That’s what I intend’, said he”. A short time afterwards\r\ncolonization was placed entirely in Maury’s hands and unlimited power\r\nto draw on the treasury was also intrusted to him; this indeed was a\r\nmark of great confidence.\r\n\r\nDuring the latter part of October, Maury’s son Richard with his\r\nwife and young son came to Mexico to assist his father and also to\r\nprepare himself to take over the work in his absence, for Maury was\r\nthen planning to make a visit to England to meet his wife and his\r\nfour younger children. Mrs. Maury had been unwilling to come to\r\nMexico,—indeed to leave Virginia at all; but she at last consented\r\nto go to England where the children might enjoy better educational\r\nadvantages. Maury and his son worked along energetically on the\r\nimmigration project, but he had already begun to have his doubts as to\r\nits success. This feeling of uncertainty was caused, not by the lack of\r\nimmigrants but by the unreadiness of the Mexican government. It was\r\nnot prepared to offer them lands on any terms, and many first-rate men\r\nfrom various parts of the South, who had been looking for homes, had\r\ngone away in disgust. The fundamental reason for failure should not,\r\nindeed, be laid at Maury’s feet. But by this time the instability of\r\nthe Mexican throne had begun to betray itself in the slowness of action\r\nand the lack of decision of the Emperor. “The indecision and weakness\r\nof Maximilian”, writes Stevenson, “prevented his taking full advantage\r\nof the opportunity then offered to strengthen the empire. The delay\r\ncaused by a vacillating policy discouraged the would-be colonists, and\r\nbefore long the flood of immigration was checked”.[21]\r\n\r\nStill some progress continued to be made. On Maury’s recommendation,\r\nGeneral Magruder, formerly of the Confederate States army, was placed\r\nin charge of the land office, under whom was to be a large number of\r\nsurveyors, most of whom were former Confederates. Among the other\r\nprominent men who had come to Mexico in the summer of 1865 were:\r\nGenerals Kirby Smith, Shelby, Slaughter, Walker, and Terrell of Texas;\r\nGovernor Price of Missouri; Ex-Governor Isham G. Harris and General\r\nWilcox of Tennessee; General Hindman of Arkansas; Governor Reynolds\r\nof Georgia; Judge John Perkins, Colonel Denis, and Pierre Soulé of\r\nLouisiana; and Major Mordecai of North Carolina. Across the frontier\r\nhad been brought horses, artillery, and everything that could be\r\ntransported. Both large and small bands of Confederate soldiers had\r\ncome over into Mexico, and some 2000 citizens had left the United\r\nStates with the intention of colonizing Sonora in Northern Mexico,\r\nthough Maury had no connection with this undertaking.\r\n\r\nHe did, however, send General Price, Judge Perkins, and Governor Harris\r\nas a commission to examine lands near Cordoba in the state of Vera\r\nCruz. They handed in a very favorable report, and here a colony, named\r\nthe “Corlotta” in honor of the Empress, was planted. Of its prospects\r\nMaury wrote enthusiastically: “In the olden times Cordoba was the\r\ngarden spot of New Spain. There stands on one side, and but a little\r\nway off, the Peak of Orizaba, with its cap of everlasting snow, and on\r\nthe other the sea in full view. These lands are heavily in debt to the\r\nChurch, and as the Church property has been confiscated—not by the\r\nEmperor, though—Max. took possession of these lands for colonization.\r\nThe railway hence to Vera Cruz passes right through them; and I am now\r\nselling these lands to immigrants, as fast as they can be surveyed,\r\nat $1.00 the acre on five years’ credit. There are about forty of our\r\npeople already there. Perkins has bought himself a house and has sent\r\nfor his family; so has Shelby, and so have a number of others. Mr.\r\nHoleman of Missouri, an Episcopal clergyman, with his family—nice\r\npeople—has been engaged by the settlement as pastor and teacher. I\r\nam going to reserve land for a church, cemetery, and school-house.\r\nThus you see, my sweet wife, colonization is a fact, not a chimera. By\r\nthe time these lands are paid for they will be worth, even if no more\r\nsettlers come to the Empire, $20, $30, or even $100 the acre, for they\r\nproduce everything under the sun, and yield perpetual harvests”.\r\n\r\nMaury’s son Richard secured 640 acres of land in this colony; and by\r\nthe first of the year 1866 about thirty families had been located\r\nthere. Other colonies had been established by that time in Chihuahua\r\nby Bryant of Arkansas, on Rio Verde in San Luis Potosi by Mitchell of\r\nMissouri, and in Jalisco by Terrell of Texas. Furthermore, the last\r\nof February, 1866, two ship loads of immigrants, who had been refused\r\npermission by General Sheridan to embark from New Orleans, arrived at\r\nVera Cruz by way of Havana. This was the condition of immigration when\r\nMaury left Mexico for a visit with his family in England.\r\n\r\nTentative permission for such a visit had been granted in September\r\nof the preceding year, and early in the following year Maximilian\r\ngraciously made good his promise in the following letter: “My dear\r\nCounselor Maury,—I have the pleasure of answering your kind letter of\r\nthe 22nd of January in which you express your just desire to see your\r\nfamily again. If on the one hand I behold with regret your absence for\r\nsome time from the Capital where you are so effectively helping us\r\nwith your intelligence; on the other hand, I realize that it is quite\r\nnecessary to fulfill one’s most sacred duties toward one’s family, and\r\nin consideration of this I cannot oppose your voyage, and my only wish\r\nis that you carry it out successfully and that you return with your\r\nfamily. I hope furthermore on returning from my journey to Cuernavaca\r\nto see you in Mexico (City) before you undertake yours, in order to\r\ntake leave of you in person. Your most affectionate, Maximilian”.\r\n\r\nThis letter was accompanied by one from the Empress, as follows:\r\n\r\n“My dear Sir,—I have spoken to the Emperor respecting our conversation\r\nof Friday last, and he wishes me to tell you first, that he grants\r\nyou a complete leave of absence to arrange your affairs in England\r\nand allows you to set off by the next French packet, but that if he\r\nreturns to Mexico in the meantime, he hopes yet to have the pleasure\r\nof seeing you; secondly, that he quite agrees with your purchasing\r\nthe instruments for studying the rainy season; and thirdly, that he\r\napproves of any effort you may make to introduce the cinchona tree, and\r\nauthorizes you to have sent from Kew a few specimens of this valuable\r\nplant. Hoping to have fulfilled my errand to your satisfaction, I only\r\nwant to renew my best wishes for your voyage and successful exertions\r\nin England, whilst I remain, Yours sincerely, Charlotte”.\r\n\r\nHere it should be said that, in the matter of cinchona cultivation,\r\nMaury left a lasting blessing to Mexico. Before leaving England in\r\n1865, he had discussed the possibility of the introduction of this\r\nfebrifuge-yielding tree into certain mountainous districts of Mexico,\r\nwith Mr. Clements Markham, who had established the cinchona plantations\r\nin India and was then in charge of all matters relating to them in the\r\nIndia Office. The feasibility of such an introduction of the plant\r\nhaving been agreed to, Maury on his return to England secured three\r\npackets of seeds from Markham, which were sent to Mexico, and from\r\nthem successful plantations were established near Cordoba and in other\r\nsections of the country. Thus Maury left a living monument to himself\r\nin the country of his adoption and short residence.\r\n\r\nThough the letters of both the Emperor and the Empress indicate an\r\nexpectation of Maury’s return to Mexico, yet in a letter to his wife,\r\nwritten before his departure, he leaves the impression that conditions\r\nin that country might not render this advisable. It was also understood\r\nby some of his friends in the United States that he was going to\r\nEngland to assist in the laying of a telegraph cable from England to\r\nthe West Indies and Mexico, and his son Richard thought his father\r\nwould not return if the cable succeeded. Though Maury did not become\r\nconnected with this enterprise, yet there developed in Mexico very\r\nsoon after his departure conditions which made his return inadvisable.\r\nIn fact, events in that unhappy country were fast moving toward\r\nMaximilian’s tragic end; and Maury was destined never to see that\r\ncountry nor its unfortunate rulers again.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\n                  REUNITED WITH HIS FAMILY IN ENGLAND\r\n\r\n\r\nMaury arrived in England from Mexico, on March 29, 1866, and was once\r\nmore united with his wife and younger children in London, at No. 30\r\nHarley Street. His appearance had been so completely changed by the\r\nsorrows, hardships, and anxieties of the long years of separation that\r\nnone of his children knew him. Indeed, his youngest daughter, on seeing\r\nhim for the first time after his arrival, exclaimed, “This is not my\r\npapa! This is an old man with a white beard!”\r\n\r\nAs soon as Maury had departed from Mexico, those who were jealous of\r\nhim and hostile to the Empire and Maximilian brought pressure to bear\r\nwhich resulted in the abolishing of the immigration scheme. This was\r\nmade known to Maury through the following letter from the Emperor:\r\n“My dear M. F. Maury,—Impelled by motives of economy and convenience\r\nto abolish the Imperial Commission of Colonization which in the month\r\nof September of last year I confided to your loyalty and superior\r\nknowledge, I must on informing you of this measure express the pleasure\r\nand satisfaction I feel for the exertions you have so successfully made\r\nin the Empire to augment its population, without which the various\r\nsources of wealth contained in its fruitful soil cannot be made\r\nproductive. If your talents cannot for the present be made available\r\nin that way, I am convinced that they will be eminently useful in the\r\ndirection of the Observatory which situation I formerly conferred\r\non you, and in which I trust you will continue, that our beautiful\r\nfirmament examined by your intelligent eye may procure us the means\r\nof profiting by the knowledge which science has already acquired, and\r\nof making even new discoveries to increase the fame which you have\r\nalready so justly attained. Whenever circumstances will permit a new\r\ndevelopment of colonization, I intend making appeal to your advice and\r\nactivity and I will now direct the necessary localities to be prepared\r\nin the Palace for the Observatory in order to be able to have you\r\nalways near me. Believe me, Your affectionate, Maximilian”.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n  MAURY AND HIS FAMILY REUNITED IN LONDON IN 1868 AFTER HIS RETURN\r\n  FROM MEXICO.\r\n\r\n  Mrs. J. R. Werth of Richmond, Virginia, a daughter of Maury (Mary\r\n  Herndon Maury in the photograph) has kindly identified the group as\r\n  follows: beginning with the lady standing on reader’s left, Eliza\r\n  Hull Maury, daughter; Admiral M. H. Jansen, Netherlands Navy, a\r\n  warm friend of the family; Lucy Minor Maury, daughter; Mary Herndon\r\n  Maury, daughter; Matthew Fontaine Maury, Junior, son; Mrs. Diana\r\n  Fontaine Maury Corbin, daughter. Commodore Maury is seated holding\r\n  his granddaughter, Nannie Maury Corbin, while Mrs. Matthew Fontaine\r\n  Maury is seated to reader’s right. Date of picture, 1868.]\r\n\r\nThis letter probably occasioned no very great surprise to Maury, but\r\nhe waited several weeks after receiving it before he replied, in part,\r\nas follows: “I read, in your letter of April 19th, fresh proofs of\r\nyour Majesty’s confidence and friendly consideration; I am touched by\r\nthem. I am grieved to learn that your Majesty should be compassed with\r\ndifficulties so serious as must be those which made it necessary to\r\nabandon such a cherished policy as I know that of colonization to have\r\nbeen.... Colonization being suspended, I fear that my return to Mexico\r\nwould tend rather to increase the embarrassments than to smooth any of\r\nthe difficulties by which your Majesty is surrounded. This fear, my\r\nsolicitude for the welfare of the Empress and yourself, and the deep\r\nconcern I feel for your success in one of the noblest undertakings\r\nthat ever animated the human breast, make me pause.... In stating the\r\nconclusion, I hope I may not be considered unmindful of obligations\r\nor insensible to kindness. Far from it. Proof that I recognize both\r\nin their highest sense is found in the fact that in homage to them I\r\nforego the high and honorable position so kindly offered me near the\r\nperson of your Majesty in the service of your Empire.... That God may\r\never have your Majesties in His holy keeping is the constant prayer of\r\nyour earnest well-wisher and humble friend, M. F. Maury”. Thus came to\r\nan end Maury’s attempt to found a “New Virginia” in Mexico.\r\n\r\nHaving declined Maximilian’s invitation to continue in his service,\r\nMaury began to cast about for some other way of earning money to\r\nsupport his family. The first thing that suggested itself to his mind\r\nwas to make use of his new discoveries in the electric mine. Though\r\nthe English engineer Holmes had carefully guarded the secrets embodied\r\nin these new ideas which had been intrusted to him by Maury, yet he\r\nhad done nothing in their exploitation and a clear field was thus left\r\nfor Maury to attempt to secure their adoption by the various European\r\ngovernments. He accordingly conceived the idea of opening a sort of\r\nschool for instructing any representatives that foreign countries might\r\nsend to him, for the fee of 500 pounds per country. This offer was made\r\nby him through a circular, which he sent out April 25, 1866 to various\r\ndiplomats in London, recommending three representatives from each\r\ncountry. He was almost immediately invited by the French government\r\nto come to Paris to teach its representatives, for which instruction\r\nthe sum of 25,000 francs was to be paid. Maury accepted this offer,\r\nand in the course of his lectures, given on May 21 and 28, 1866, he\r\ndemonstrated the effectiveness of his electric mines on the River Seine\r\nat Saint Cloud in the presence of the Emperor Napoleon. This visit led\r\nto his being invited to become a French citizen, and his being offered\r\na position in the Meteorological Observatory in Paris. His family was\r\nnot willing for him to accept this position but preferred to return\r\nto the United States at the earliest opportunity, and he accordingly\r\ndeclined the offer.\r\n\r\nIn July, 1866 representatives from Sweden and Norway, and Holland\r\ncame to London to be instructed. There is some evidence that Russia\r\nand England also sent representatives at this time. “I have a school\r\nunder weigh”, humorously wrote Maury, “with Sweden and Norway as\r\npupils—board and tuition 500 pounds. They will graduate in ‘sea\r\nmining’ this week. Monday the 16th, the school opens for the Dutch at\r\n500 pounds. I have heard no more about turning Frenchman. But the King\r\nof Wurttemberg has been pestering me to keep the Prussians out of his\r\npea-patch of a kingdom. ‘Barkis is willing’, but I can’t say whether\r\nanything will come out of it; I think not as the war looks like it is\r\ndrawing to a close”.\r\n\r\nThe lectures which Maury gave in connection with the demonstrations\r\nof his mines gave an introductory sketch of all that his predecessors\r\nsince the time of Priestly had done in this field, an account of all\r\nthat had been accomplished by the South with this new weapon during the\r\nlate war, and then in detail the results of his own experiments. As\r\nfar as the submarine mine was concerned, he added nothing new to what\r\nhe had set down in the agreement with Holmes which was drawn up by him\r\njust before leaving England near the close of the war. But as to their\r\nuse on land, the following details appear for the first time among his\r\npapers: “After this hasty sketch, I come to electrical torpedoes for\r\nguarding mountain passes and roadways, etc., for the protection of\r\nstrongholds and the defense of fortified positions. Shells cast for\r\nthe purpose should be used, but in an emergency tin canisters, or any\r\nother perfectly water-tight cases, will answer. I am not aware that\r\nelectricity was used by either of the belligerents in the late American\r\nwar for springing mines on land.\r\n\r\n“The cases for land-torpedoes should be shells cast expressly for the\r\npurpose. The thickness of the shell being from one-fourth to an inch,\r\nand even more, or less, according to the size and the probable handling\r\nin transportation.\r\n\r\n“They should be spherical; only instead of a hole for the fuse, as in a\r\nhollow shot, they should have a neck like a bottle, with a cap to screw\r\nover—not in—the neck. The case should be charged through the neck,\r\nand the wires let in through two holes, counter-sunk, diametrically\r\nopposite, the counter-sinking being for the purpose of receiving\r\npitch or other resinous matter to keep the water out. The fuse, being\r\nadjusted to the wires, should be held in its place by a string through\r\nthe neck, while the wires are drawn out taut and sealed within and\r\nwithout. Having proved the fuse, first fill and then drive in a wooden\r\npeg. Then fill the space between it and the screw-cap with red lead,\r\nand screw down tight so as to make it water-tight. Now secure the tails\r\nof the wires so that they will not be chafed or bruised, and the mine\r\nis ready to be packed for transportation. They are generally to be used\r\nin stone fougasses, the wire being buried at convenient depths, and\r\nall marks of fougasses and trenches removed as completely as possible.\r\nAny number, not exceeding twenty-five or thirty, may be arranged in\r\na single circuit for the ebonite; but if the magnetic exploder of\r\nWheatstone be preferred, and the ground be perfectly dry, hundreds may\r\nbe planted in a ladder-circuit, which you have seen handled.\r\n\r\n“The operator may be at any distance from these mines when he explodes\r\nthem, provided only he has established some mark or point which, on\r\nbeing reached by the enemy, should serve as his signal. The area of\r\ndestruction of one fougasse, properly constructed, with a charge of\r\ntwenty or twenty-five pounds of powder, may be assumed to be that of\r\na circle seventy-five or eighty yards in diameter. Twenty mines would\r\ntherefore serve for a mile. Several miles may be planted in a night,\r\nand the assailants may be enticed or invited out in the morning. Passes\r\nbefore an invading army may be mined in advance, and thus, if he cannot\r\nbe destroyed, his progress may be so retarded by dummies or sham mines\r\nas almost literally to compel him to dig his way.\r\n\r\n“The power to telegraph through these torpedoes is of little\r\nconsequence, inasmuch as there need be but one station and one\r\noperator. Using the testing-fuse manufactured by Abel, and a weak\r\nvoltaic current, the operator can at any time satisfy himself as to\r\ncontinuity. Thus bridges and gulfs or breaks are not required for the\r\nland as they are in sea-mining. Ebonite has the further advantage on\r\nland that it takes but a single wire.\r\n\r\n“Forts may be protected against assault, and your own rifle-pits from\r\noccupation by an enemy, simply by a proper distribution of those new\r\nengines of war. They may be planted line within line, and one row above\r\nanother, and so arranged that volcanoes may be sprung at will under the\r\nfeet of assaulting columns.\r\n\r\n“The only attempt that was made in the late American war to bring the\r\nelectrical torpedo into play on the land was made by the Confederates\r\nat Fort Fisher, in 1865, just before its fall. The narrow landspit\r\nover which the attacking party had to advance was mined. The officer\r\nin charge used the magneto exploder. But the mines would not go\r\noff, owing no doubt to defective arrangement, for the instrument\r\nwas new to him, and he had not been posted up as to the virtues of\r\nthe ladder-circuit. The instrument used on this occasion was just\r\nsuch a one as this before you. It was the first that had reached\r\nthe Confederacy. Here is then a most striking illustration of the\r\nimportance of previous study and drill in this new and important arm of\r\ndefense”.\r\n\r\nIn addition to Wurttemberg, Maury offered this instruction in electric\r\nmining to her enemy Prussia, and also to the Governor General of Canada\r\nfor the sum of 1000 pounds sterling. These offers were not accepted.\r\nHis experiments had, however, been made known in this way to a number\r\nof different governments, later information concerning his discoveries\r\nleaked out through his agent in London to other countries, and finally\r\nhis system became so generally known that his particular contributions\r\nto the development of this weapon of warfare were lost sight of, and as\r\na consequence Maury has not been given the credit that is justly due\r\nhim in histories of the electric mine.\r\n\r\nThe money which Maury received from these demonstrations of mines came\r\nat a time when it was greatly needed, for he had lost practically all\r\nhis property in the United States through the war and after his last\r\narrival in England he had had the further misfortune to lose, through\r\nthe failure of a banker, all he had brought from Mexico. At about this\r\ntime, however, assistance came to him from another source. Indeed,\r\nbefore his departure from England near the end of the war, a “Maury\r\nTestimonial” had been begun at the instigation of some of his English\r\nfriends, especially the Reverend Dr. Tremlett, and by Commodore Jansen.\r\nWhile Maury was in Mexico, these friends solicited funds for him both\r\nin England and on the Continent, Tremlett even taking the trouble of\r\ntraveling through Sweden, Denmark, and Russia for that purpose. A\r\nfew months after Maury’s return to England this sum had reached the\r\ntotal of 3000 guineas. Holland contributed 1100 pounds, the Grand Duke\r\nConstantine gave privately 1000 pounds, and naval officers, scientists,\r\nand friends of Maury in England and elsewhere on the Continent\r\nsubscribed the remainder.\r\n\r\nThe presentation was made at a special dinner given in Maury’s honor\r\nat Willis’s Rooms in London on June 5, 1866. Sir John Pakington,\r\nFirst Lord of the Admiralty, presided, and there were present the\r\nDanish, Mexican, and Argentine ministers, six British admirals, high\r\nofficers of the Swedish and Russian navies, General Beauregard of the\r\nConfederate army, Professor Tyndall, and many of Maury’s personal\r\nfriends like John Laird, Commodore Jansen, and Dr. Tremlett, who was\r\nHonorary Secretary of the Testimonial Fund. The purse containing the\r\n3000 guineas was presented in a handsome silver-gilt casket, and was\r\naccompanied by the following testimonial: “We the undersigned beg\r\nyour acceptance of the accompanying purse of Three Thousand Guineas\r\nin appreciation and acknowledgment of the eminent and disinterested\r\nservices which through years of untiring zeal in the cause of science\r\nyou have rendered to the maritime nations of the world. Receive from\r\nus this public testimony of our regard with every wish for your future\r\nwelfare and happiness”.[22]\r\n\r\nIn July, 1866, Maury was engaged by Richardson and Company, a\r\npublishing house of New York City, to write a series of geographies for\r\nthe public schools. It was agreed to make the series embrace “First\r\nLessons in Geography”, “Intermediate Geography”, “Manual of Geography”,\r\n“Academic Geography”, and “Physical Geography”. Maury was to be paid\r\n$10,000, $1000 for each volume on the receipt of the manuscript and\r\n$1000 more for each volume three months after publication. He was\r\nto receive also $600 for revising each book, for five successive\r\nyears. The following year an additional agreement was signed for the\r\npublishing of “Practical Astronomy for Schools”, Maury to receive $1500\r\nafter the delivery of the manuscript and $1500 three months after its\r\npublication.\r\n\r\nIn August, 1866 Maury wrote, “I am hard at work on Geography No. I,\r\n‘Brave’ drawing the maps. Well, I could not wind up my career more\r\nusefully—and usefulness is both honor and glory—than by helping to\r\nshape the character and mould the destinies of the rising generations”.\r\nMost of the work on these school books was completed before he left\r\nEngland to return to Virginia in the summer of 1868, but at that time\r\nonly the first two of the series; namely, “First Lessons in Geography”\r\nand “The World We Live In”, which was the “Intermediate Geography”\r\nof the contract, had been published. From the very beginning their\r\nreception in the United States was very flattering, and Maury was\r\ndelighted with his success.\r\n\r\nThe first little book contained only sixty-two pages. Its preface\r\nstated that the pupils were to be taken on imaginary voyages and\r\njourneys twice around the world—once by sea and once by land, and\r\nit closed with these very significant words: “The teacher should\r\n_teach_, as well as _hear recitations_”. The second book had just one\r\nhundred pages, and was published the same year. These two books were\r\nlater merged into one, which was entitled “Elementary Geography”, and\r\nafterwards called “New Elements of Geography”. In the preface of the\r\n1922 edition of the latter is the following tribute to Maury’s ideas of\r\npedagogy: “Maury refused to follow the plan of all accepted textbooks\r\nof that day. His plan was to present, in simple words and in the form\r\nof a story, interesting facts about the different peoples of the\r\nearth, their homes, their industries, and the lands where they live;\r\nand at the same time to call attention to those physical laws which\r\nlargely determine the condition, the character, and the industries of\r\na people.... When published, these geographies were such a radical\r\ndeparture from the old methods that many teachers were not prepared\r\nto accept them; but leading educators have gradually come to Maury’s\r\nposition, and to-day the principles that he advocated are endorsed by\r\nthe Committee of Fifteen of the National Educational Association”. The\r\naccount of the other books in Maury’s geographical series, which were\r\nnot published until after his return to Virginia, will be found in the\r\nnext chapter.\r\n\r\nWhen Maury left Mexico he had some hope of becoming connected with the\r\nlaying of submarine cables in the Atlantic. But the only opportunity\r\nthat presented itself was the offer of 1000 pounds for the use of his\r\nname in connection with the North Atlantic Cable. Maury was unwilling\r\nto agree to this, and the proposition did not materialize. He kept up\r\nhis interest in such engineering work, however, and in July, 1866 he\r\nwrote that he had filed “provisional specifications” for a patent to\r\nimprove the manufacture and laying of deep-sea cables, which would\r\ndecrease the cost almost one half. But in the final successful laying\r\nof the Atlantic Telegraph Cable, completed in that very same month,\r\nMaury had no part. Though Field had been, before the war, quite ready\r\nto accord him due credit for his assistance in laying the first cable\r\nacross the Atlantic, yet at the banquet given him by the New York\r\nChamber of Commerce at the Metropolitan Hotel, on November 15, 1866,\r\nhe only casually referred to Maury’s name. Two years later at a dinner\r\nin his honor in Willis’s Rooms, London, on July 1, 1868, Field did\r\nnot even mention, in his speech, the name of Maury, who that very day\r\nsailed at last for his home in the United States.\r\n\r\nThe success of the Atlantic Cable, however, brought Maury another\r\ndecoration. This was offered by Maximilian in the following letter: “My\r\ndear Counselor Maury,—It was with pride that I heard of the scientific\r\ntriumph just achieved, and due to your illustrious labors. The\r\nTransatlantic Cable, while uniting both hemispheres, will continually\r\nrecall to their minds the debt of gratitude they owe to your genius. I\r\ncongratulate you with all my heart, and I am pleased at announcing to\r\nyou that I have appointed you Grand Cross of the Order of Guadalupe.\r\nReceive the assurance of the good wishes of your affectionate,\r\nMaximilian”. Maury, not realizing perhaps that Maximilian recognized\r\njustly his right to share in the honor of the final success of the\r\nlaying of the Atlantic Telegraph, replied modestly, “The letters of the\r\n16th and 18th of August with which I am honored show how kind and good\r\nyour Majesty always is. They do me much—too much honor, for I had no\r\nhand in the achievement to which your Majesty so graciously refers.\r\nThe Telegraphic Cable in which I am to take part is not yet ready; when\r\nit is, I hope to deserve the Imperial ‘well done’ which is ever ready\r\nto encourage all good works. For the present, therefore, I do not ask\r\nfor the decoration of Grand Cross of the Order of Guadalupe”.\r\n\r\nIn the same letter, Maury shows that he was not unmindful of the trend\r\nof events in Mexico, for he continued, “Events have vindicated the\r\nwisdom of my not returning to Mexico. Jealousies within and enmity\r\nwithout had already paralyzed my efforts to serve your Majesty and\r\nEmpire. I still see in the efforts of the Emperor and Empress of Mexico\r\nto give good government with its blessings to that distracted country\r\none of the most sublime moral spectacles that is to be found in the\r\nannals of dynasties. As soon as I discovered that I could not assist in\r\nthe noble work I resolved to stay away, for I have not the heart either\r\nto hinder or embarrass your Majesty in these great labors. Animated by\r\nthe sentiments which I professed when first we met, I have the honor\r\nto subscribe myself an humble but true friend of your Majesty’s. M. F.\r\nMaury”.\r\n\r\nBy the end of June, 1866, matters had come to such a pass in Mexico,\r\nthrough the exhaustion of the resources of the government, the\r\nannounced determination of Napoleon III to withdraw all French troops\r\nfrom the country, and the opposition to Maximilian’s regime by both\r\nrepublicans and clericals in Mexico as well as by the government of\r\nthe United States, that the throne appeared so much in danger that the\r\nEmpress determined, much against Maximilian’s wishes, to go to France\r\nto make personal appeal for assistance from the Emperor Napoleon, who\r\nhad promised Maximilian to support him in Mexico for five years.\r\nAfter failing to secure help from the French Emperor who had concluded\r\nthat it was not politic for him longer to support his protegees in\r\nMexico, she left the palace of Saint Cloud, after exclaiming, “What\r\nafter all should I, a daughter of a Bourbon, have expected from the\r\nword of a Bonaparte!” Going thence to Pope Pius IX in Rome, she was\r\nequally unsuccessful in obtaining papal intervention. So terrible\r\nwas the effect of this failure upon the overwrought Empress that\r\nshe immediately afterwards, October 1, lost her reason and became\r\nhopelessly insane.[23]\r\n\r\nMaximilian was informed of his wife’s condition, and made up his mind\r\nto abdicate the throne. In this he was advised by General Bazaine,\r\nthrough instructions from his master, Napoleon himself, who wished\r\nMaximilian to leave with the French troops. But in an evil hour he\r\nlistened to the advice of the clericals and made up his mind to remain\r\nin Mexico. Events then moved rapidly to a tragic climax. The French\r\ntroops began leaving in February, 1867, the last embarking March 12;\r\nthe republican government under Juarez extended its power rapidly, and\r\non May 15 at Queretaro Maximilian with his Mexican generals Miramon and\r\nMejia were betrayed by Colonel Lopez to the Juarists and, after a trial\r\nby court-martial, were shot on June 19. Of this event Maury wrote,\r\n“Poor Max! He died for his honor. He and ‘my’ Carlotta are the martyrs\r\nof the age”.\r\n\r\nAs affecting his own affairs, he afterwards wrote of this Mexican\r\ntragedy, “But for my good luck in having J. D. and Mal. for enemies\r\nto send me here into banishment, and then kind Mexican villains to\r\nintrigue me out of Mexico, you see the rocks that but for enemies I\r\nshould have split upon”. A very few years afterwards the mills of the\r\ngods ground out their punishment for the faithless Emperor Napoleon,\r\nand his empire went down like a house of cards before the onrush of\r\nthe German armies in 1870. Of Maury’s connection with Maximilian and\r\nNapoleon, his cousin Rutson Maury wrote, “It was a special Providence\r\nthat carried you away from Mexico and that prevented your linking your\r\nfortunes with those of Louis Napoleon”.\r\n\r\nMaury’s decision to remain in England turned out better, in every way,\r\nthan he had anticipated. Here in London in the midst of most pleasant\r\nand congenial surroundings he lived with his wife, three youngest\r\ndaughters, and son Matthew, Jr., who was then attending the London\r\nSchool of Mines. During this peaceful life, in 1866, Maury became a\r\nregular member of the Church, being confirmed with his son and his\r\ndaughter Lucy in Dr. Tremlett’s church at Belsize Park, London, by Dr.\r\nCharles Todd Quintard, Bishop of Tennessee, who was then in England to\r\nattend the Pan-Anglican Assembly at Lambeth and also to raise money for\r\nthe University of the South at Sewanee.\r\n\r\nIn 1868, Maury was signally honored by Cambridge University which\r\nbestowed upon him the degree of LL.D. He was accompanied to Cambridge\r\nfor the ceremonies by his wife, his daughters Mary and Lucy, and his\r\nfriend, the Reverend Dr. Tremlett. Maury thus humorously referred to\r\nthe occasion: “So you don’t know what I mean by the ‘coronation’, eh?\r\nWhy boy, I’m a Cambridge LL.D. and am going there, I and Max and the\r\nQueen on the 28th—she to unveil the Prince Consort and I to be rigged\r\nup in ‘died garments from Bozra’ in a gown and a cap and a beautiful\r\nred silk cowl and hear myself all done up in Latin!”\r\n\r\nThe “Max” whom Maury mentioned in this letter was Max Müller, the\r\nfamous Sanskrit scholar. Still another distinguished savant received\r\nthe LL.D. on the same day; this was William Wright, translator of\r\nEgyptian manuscripts and hieroglyphics at the British Museum.[24] He\r\nwrote afterwards to Maury of the bestowal of the degrees as follows:\r\n“I have not been at Cambridge lately, but I know that all our friends\r\nthere are well. Max Müller is now in Germany; I hope to see him at Kiel\r\nat the end of September, when we shall both attend the gathering of the\r\nGerman Orientalists. Lord, what a figure we three of us looked, dressed\r\nup like _lobsters_, in the midst of that big hall, gazed at by such a\r\nhost of people, ‘when shall we three meet again?’ Certainly never under\r\nthe like circumstances. I was glad to see that Oxford conferred its\r\ndegree the other day on your poet Longfellow”.\r\n\r\nDuring the ceremonies, the Dean made a long oration in Latin, which\r\nwas addressed to the newly-made “learned Doctors”. The portion of\r\nthis which introduced Maury is as follows: “I present to you Matthew\r\nFontaine Maury, who while serving in the American Navy did not permit\r\nthe clear edge of his mind to be dulled, or his ardor for study to\r\nbe dissipated, by the variety of his professional labors, or by his\r\ncontinual change of place, but who, by the attentive observations of\r\nthe course of the winds, the climate, the currents of the seas and\r\noceans, acquired these materials for knowledge, which afterwards in\r\nleisure, while he presided over the Observatory at Washington, he\r\nsystematized in charts and in a book—charts which are now in the\r\nhands of all seamen, and a book which has carried the fame of its\r\nauthor into the most distant countries of the earth. Nor is he merely\r\na high authority in nautical science. He is also a pattern of noble\r\nmanners and good morals, because in the guidance of his own life he\r\nhas always shown himself a brave and good man. When that cruel Civil\r\nWar in America was imminent, this man did not hesitate to leave home\r\nand friends, a place of high honor and an office singularly adapted\r\nto his genius—to throw away, in one word, all the goods and gifts of\r\nfortune—that he might defend and sustain the cause which seemed to him\r\nthe just one. ‘The victorious cause pleased the gods’, and now perhaps,\r\nas victorious causes will do, it pleases the majority of men, and yet\r\nno one can withhold his admiration from the man who, though numbered\r\namong the vanquished, held his faith pure and unblemished even at the\r\nprice of poverty and exile”.\r\n\r\nThus did England make amends for its former failure to honor Maury\r\nbefore the Civil War when medals and decorations were bestowed upon\r\nhim by so many other European governments. While in Cambridge, Maury\r\ngave a lecture on “Science and the Bible; Educational Ideals of the\r\nSouth” to further the interest in England in the financial support of\r\nthe University of the South at Sewanee, Tennessee. In this address he\r\ncontended for religious education in the college, and maintained that\r\nthe Bible and science do not conflict if each is rightly interpreted.\r\n\r\nNot long after Maury’s return to England, his friends began to urge him\r\nto return to the United States. There was some talk of a professorship\r\nin astronomy for him at the University of Virginia; and a definite\r\noffer of a chair in the Virginia Military Institute was made to him by\r\nthe Superintendent as early as February, 1867. A little later he was\r\nasked to become the vice-chancellor of the University of the South,\r\nand for several months he was favorably inclined toward accepting this\r\nposition. He finally decided, however, in favor of the professorship\r\nat the Virginia Military Institute at $2000 a year. He did not go\r\nto Sewanee, he said, because he thought the Episcopalians at the\r\nNorth were not disposed to assist the institution and the financial\r\narrangements did not give the assurance of reasonable grounds for\r\nsuccess.\r\n\r\nMaury’s letter of acceptance of the Chair of Meteorology in Virginia\r\nMilitary Institute is, in part, as follows: “I thank you kindly for\r\nyour letter of the 3rd inst. (April, 1868), explaining my duties in the\r\nnew Chair. They being such as therein defined, you have induced me to\r\naccept. I should lack courage to undertake a regular course of lectures\r\nas one of the faculty, simply because it would lead me into an untried\r\nline of life; and as my rule is to put my heart into whatever I attempt\r\nto do, and try my best, I should have to work overmuch—especially at\r\nthe beginning—and I am afraid of that. The consideration, therefore,\r\nthat I am not to be charged with a class, or expected to deliver a\r\nregular course of lectures, removes a ‘sea of troubles’ and leaves me\r\nin a field of research in which I am not altogether a ‘raw hand’....\r\nYou certainly do draw a very bright picture of the work that is before\r\nme (The Physical Survey of Virginia)—of the results that are expected\r\nfrom it, and of the success that is to attend my labors. We do not\r\nweigh in the same balance the force that I can bring to the work.\r\nTherefore, as bright as your picture is, I have my fears of what there\r\nmay be on the other side. ‘Still, it’s wise and brave to hope the\r\nbest’, and, bringing willing hearts and ready hands to the work, we’ll\r\ntry to rub even the dark side bright, should it be turned towards us”.\r\n\r\nThough the General Amnesty was not passed until May 22, 1872, and\r\nVirginia had not as yet been restored to normal relations with the\r\nUnion, her passing from Federal military control to home rule taking\r\nplace from April to November, 1869, still the Northern attitude toward\r\nthe Confederate leaders had already undergone considerable change, as\r\nevidenced by the release of Jefferson Davis under bail of $100,000 in\r\nMay, 1867. Maury felt sure, therefore, that he would not be molested\r\nif he returned to the United States, and accordingly after bidding his\r\nmany warm friends in England farewell, he set sail with his family from\r\nLiverpool, on July 1, 1868, for the home from which he had been absent\r\nfor six years,—years filled with unusual and trying experiences.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XV\r\n\r\n                      HIS LAST YEARS IN VIRGINIA\r\n\r\n\r\nMaury arrived at New York on July 16, 1868, and was agreeably surprised\r\nat his treatment there. “The custom house authorities”, he wrote,\r\n“received me with marked consideration and passed all luggage without\r\ndifficulty”. Early in August he reached Richmond, much pleased with his\r\nreception in his native state. “In the South”, he declared, “it’s been\r\na sort of ovation.... My coming home to share the hard lot of these\r\npeople instead of accepting French honors is looked upon as a high\r\ndisplay of patriotism”.\r\n\r\nAfter spending a part of the summer at the White Sulphur Springs as a\r\nguest of the proprietors, he was installed, on the 10th of September,\r\nin his professorial chair at Virginia Military Institute. The\r\nceremonies were held in the open air on a temporary platform in front\r\nof the Superintendent’s quarters. The faculty of Washington College, of\r\nwhich General Robert E. Lee was then the Rector, were present, as well\r\nas a large number of the citizens of Lexington. Superintendent Francis\r\nH. Smith welcomed Maury on behalf of the Institute, and Governor\r\nLetcher, as a representative of the Board of Governors of which he was\r\nthe president, also made an address of welcome. Maury gave an “extended\r\ncommentary” on the sciences, as the principal speech of the day. On\r\nthis occasion, according to one of his daughters, Maury wore his\r\nforeign decorations, and “the cadets were mightily pleased and cheered\r\ntill their little throats were dry”.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n  _Courtesy of “The Journal of American History,” Vol. IV, Number 3\r\n  (1910)._\r\n\r\n  PORTRAIT TAKEN DURING THE LAST YEARS OF MAURY, WHILE AT THE\r\n  VIRGINIA MILITARY INSTITUTE]\r\n\r\nMaury did not take up his residence in Lexington until the following\r\nyear, on June 10, as his house there was not ready for his family until\r\nthat time. With Richmond as his home during the autumn and winter,\r\nhe was busily engaged in lecturing, in making preparations for the\r\nphysical survey of the material and mineral resources of Virginia, in\r\ndistributing cinchona seeds which had been sent to him from England,\r\nin trying to arouse interest in the establishment of an agricultural\r\nschool in connection with the Virginia Military Institute, and in\r\nworking in the interest of the Chesapeake and Ohio Railway and the\r\nestablishment of a direct line of steamers from Norfolk to Flushing.\r\nThe most important address that he delivered during this period was\r\ngiven at the Staunton Fair on October 28, 1868. In this speech he\r\nreferred to the opinion which had gotten abroad in the North, and even\r\nin England, that the South had become lacking in energy and enterprise,\r\nand he advised that they make use of their water power, encourage\r\nGerman and Dutch immigrants to come to Virginia, and begin to construct\r\nbetter roads.\r\n\r\nWhen Maury went with his family to Lexington to reside, he was greatly\r\npleased with his new home. “Here we are”, he wrote, “in our new home,\r\nbusy fixing up; and things begin to know their places. So we also\r\nbegin to have a home-feeling. People are very kind, the country is\r\nbeautiful, the views and the scenery lovely, and both climate and air\r\nsuch that exercise is enjoyment”. In these congenial surroundings he\r\nset to work with a will in the performance of his new duties, special\r\nattention being given to the making of the physical survey of Virginia.\r\nThe object of this work was twofold; namely, to hasten the development\r\nof all the state’s natural resources, agricultural and mineral, and\r\nto remove prejudice against the South so that immigrants would be\r\nattracted to the deserted farms. As in the old days at the Observatory,\r\nwhen he was investigating the winds and currents, Maury brought into\r\nplay his power of inspiring others with enthusiastic coöperation, and\r\nsoon reports and communications came pouring into his office at the\r\nInstitute from all parts of the state. There was some rivalry, in the\r\nmatter of the survey, between Washington College and Virginia Military\r\nInstitute. Maury declared that the College tried to steal his thunder,\r\nand that he published what was called a “Preliminary Report” in order\r\nto “knock them on the head”. The complete survey was unfinished at the\r\ntime of his death; but a portion of it was published by his son Matthew\r\nin 1878.\r\n\r\nMaury also continued work on his geographical series, only the first\r\ntwo books of which had been published before he left England. The\r\n“Academic Geography” of the original plan was abandoned; but in\r\n1871 his “Manual of Geography” appeared, and in 1873 his “Physical\r\nGeography”. The first was very favorably received. One review dwelt\r\nparticularly on the author’s power of making a tedious and dry subject\r\ninteresting and agreeable, commended the illustrations, and declared\r\nthat the book would delight any schoolroom in which the teacher is not\r\nhopelessly unfit to teach. “We are sure”, it continued, “that where it\r\nis adopted the geography lesson will become suddenly and surprisingly\r\npopular”. The preface to the edition, which was revised by Mytton\r\nMaury and re-copyrighted in 1880 by the University Publishing Company,\r\nstated, “Among the marked excellences of the early edition was its\r\npresentation of geography in the character of a science rather than an\r\nassemblage of disconnected facts. Land and air and ocean were treated\r\nas parts of a grand mechanism; rivers were discussed not simply as\r\n‘divisions of water’ but as having definite ‘offices’ to perform;\r\nmountains were not merely masses of a certain altitude, but regulators\r\nof rainfall. It was also carefully pointed out how the geographical\r\nposition and climate of a country determine its industries. Trade was\r\nshown to be in a special manner under the influence of geographical\r\nlaw”.\r\n\r\nIn a still later revision[25] the publishers called attention to the\r\nfact that Maury’s text, wherever possible, was retained because it\r\nwas “so clear, simple, and attractive that it has won for the book\r\nthe uniform favor of the teachers using it. The original text makes\r\nup so large a part of the book that it is essentially Maury’s work.\r\nMaury’s Geographies never belonged to the old school, but rather to\r\nthe new. Being devoted to the study of physical geography, and father\r\nof the science of ‘Physical Geography of the Sea’, he undertook the\r\npreparation of his book originally with the intention and purpose\r\n‘to redeem the most delightful of subjects from the bondage of dry\r\nstatistics on the one hand, and on the other, from the drudgery of\r\nvague, general ideas’”.\r\n\r\nMaury’s first book on physical geography was published in London\r\nin 1864, while he was in England during the Civil War. It bore the\r\ntitle, “Physical Geography for Schools and General Readers”, and was\r\ntranslated into Dutch, French, and Russian. The book is said not to\r\nhave been very popular in England, because it presupposed an “extent\r\nof knowledge among teachers in schools that seldom exists”. Maury\r\naccordingly entirely rewrote it for his series; as he says in the\r\npreface, it was begun in England in 1866 and was the joint work of\r\nhim, his wife, and his daughters. This book also was revised after\r\nMaury’s death, and slightly abridged and re-arranged, though the charm\r\nof the author’s style was retained. Later, it was revised and largely\r\nre-written by Frederic William Simonds of the University of Texas, for\r\nthe American Book Company, in 1908, though in doing so the attempt was\r\nmade “to preserve as far as possible the plan of the older work—a plan\r\nthat has met the approval of a generation of teachers—and at the same\r\ntime to modernize the text thoroughly”.\r\n\r\nIn 1866, Maury began, under an agreement with his publisher Richardson,\r\nanother book, entitled “Practical Astronomy for Schools”, and this\r\nwas practically finished before he left England. But the work was\r\nnever published, though it reached the stage of galley proof, in which\r\ncondition it has been preserved among Maury’s papers. Its failure of\r\npublication was probably due to financial embarrassment on the part\r\nof the University Publishing Company, which became the firm name of\r\nRichardson’s company on January 1, 1869. For several years this company\r\nhad a hard struggle and more than once was on the verge of bankruptcy.\r\nMaury experienced difficulty in collecting money due him from the\r\ncompany, and only the advice of his cousin Rutson kept him from\r\nresorting to law to force payments.\r\n\r\nBut all these financial matters were adjusted eventually in an amicable\r\nfashion, for the popularity of the geographical series brought in a\r\ngreat deal of money to all concerned. In 1871, Maury wrote that the\r\ngeographies had already been adopted in more than 5000 schools in the\r\nSouth, with an average of some forty books to each school. A little\r\nafterwards he declared that the series had cleared during the year\r\n1871 upwards of $30,000. Finally, on January 1, 1872, he sold all the\r\ncopyrights to Richardson under the following agreement: “I have sold\r\nyou the copyright _in this country_ to all the books, five in number,\r\nand wall maps, eight in the series, and you have paid for them in full.\r\nI am to revise and by new editions keep the said five books up to the\r\ntimes, for five years for $1000 in gold a year, counting from January\r\n15, 1870. Two of these annual instalments have become due, for each\r\nof which I hold your note. The eight wall maps in place of the fourth\r\nschool geography originally contracted for, were to be published in\r\nmy name, but constructed at your expense and under my control so as\r\nto justify me in claiming their authorship. Besides this you have\r\ngenerously volunteered to pay me _during my life_ ten per cent upon the\r\ncopy money annually coming to you upon any and all of the books and\r\nwall maps aforesaid”.\r\n\r\nIn 1870, Maury was offered the presidency of St. John’s College at\r\nAnnapolis, Maryland, at a salary of $3000 and quarters for his family;\r\nbut it was declined. He had come to believe that the winters, even of\r\nVirginia, were too severe for his health, and spent a portion of the\r\nwinter of 1870–1871, with one of his daughters and his youngest son, at\r\nthe home of a sister, Mrs. Halland, at Holly Springs, Mississippi and\r\nin New Orleans, Mobile, and Savannah.\r\n\r\nEarly in 1871, he was urged to become the President of the University\r\nof Alabama at a salary of $3500 and home, and with the privilege of\r\nselecting his faculty. The proposed salary was raised to $5000, so\r\nanxious were the board to have him at the head of the institution, and\r\nMaury finally accepted on July 30, 1871 by telegraph, “I will come”.\r\nBut on August 17, he resigned the position on the grounds that the\r\narrangements for funds for the University were unsatisfactory and not\r\nin agreement with verbal statements made to him. He had gone so far as\r\nto write out his inaugural address and send copies of it to various\r\nSouthern newspapers, and his “Manual of Geography”, which was published\r\nat about this time, bore on its title page the statement that he was\r\nthe President of the University of Alabama.\r\n\r\nIt was then that Raphael Semmes, famous commander of the _Alabama_,\r\nunder the impression that Maury was soon to be at the head of the\r\nuniversity of his native Alabama, wrote a eulogy of his friend, which\r\nappeared in the Montgomery _Advance_ of September 25, 1871. It closed\r\nwith the following estimate of Maury’s achievements: “Thou hast\r\nrevealed to us the secrets of the depths of the ocean, traced its\r\ncurrents, discoursed to us of its storms and its calms, and taught\r\nus which of its roads to travel and which to avoid. Every mariner,\r\nfor countless ages to come, as he takes down his charts to shape his\r\ncourse across the seas, will think of thee! He will think of thee as\r\nhe casts his lead into the deep sea; he will think of thee as he draws\r\na bucket of water from it to examine its animalculæ; he will think of\r\nthee as he sees the storm gathering thick and ominous; he will think\r\nof thee as he approaches the calm-belts, and especially the calm-belts\r\nof the equator, with its mysterious cloud rings; he will think of\r\nthee as he is scudding before the ‘brave west winds’ of the Southern\r\nhemisphere; in short, there is no phenomenon of the sea that will not\r\nrecall to him thine image. This is the living monument which thou hast\r\nconstructed for thyself”.\r\n\r\nMaury had, by this time, become dissatisfied with his situation at\r\nLexington. “I shall not”, he wrote, “risk another winter here for two\r\nreasons—one on the score of health. The other—I have worked out\r\nPhysical Survey as far as it can be worked out without money. And\r\nI feel that I am not earning my salt. Though the Board of Visitors\r\nand Faculty are kind enough to express quite a different opinion. So\r\nafter the swallows come I shall begin to inquire about lodgings in\r\nFredericksburg or Richmond. In all, except the salt-earning feature, my\r\nsituation here is as delightful as man can make it”. Somewhat later,\r\nhe declared, “They are sounding me about the University of Tennessee.\r\nRemember Alabama; I shall look very closely—and not trust to verbal\r\nstatements—before I commit myself again. You know I intend to cut\r\nout from here at the end of the term anyhow. My situation here is\r\ncharming and delightful as it can be. And though I may be rendering\r\nthe state service, the state butters me no parsnips. Virginia Military\r\nInstitute does that and though V. M. I. tries very kindly to persuade\r\nme that it’s all the same, I can’t see it. And so I am quite ready for\r\nTennessee or anywhere else that will offer inducements sufficient”.\r\n\r\nHe, accordingly, handed in his resignation in May to take effect the\r\nfollowing September; but there were so many protests against his\r\naction, from the Governor of the state all down the line, that he\r\nreconsidered the matter and agreed, in July, to remain at V. M. I.\r\nfor the time being. After his resignation, he had been approached by\r\na member of the Board of Trustees of the Agricultural College near\r\nBlacksburg, Virginia, who asked permission to propose Maury’s name as\r\ntheir president, but he declined the proposal. Inquiry was also made of\r\nhim whether he would accept the presidency of a Polytechnic College to\r\nbe founded at New Orleans. This appealed to him, particularly on the\r\nscore of his health, but the project did not materialize.\r\n\r\nIn addition to his work on the “Physical Survey of Virginia” and his\r\ngeographical series, Maury spent considerable time upon the preparation\r\nand delivery of lectures and addresses, not in great numbers during\r\nhis first two years at Lexington but with increasing frequency during\r\nthe last years of his life. Among the notable speeches he made during\r\n1869 were an address to the graduating class of V. M. I., July 2, and\r\nanother before the Educational Association of Virginia, on December\r\n16. In the former, he emphasized the fact that what they accomplished\r\nin life would depend largely on their own ‘resolves’, that they had\r\nnot ‘finished’ their education but merely laid the foundation, that\r\nthey should desire to master the specialty they took up but not to\r\nbecome narrow-minded, and that they should form the habit of observing\r\nnature for there they would see God. In closing, he called upon them\r\nto live up to their traditions. The later address is a plea for the\r\ngiving of more attention in the educational system to the study of the\r\nphysical sciences in view of the progress and development of physical\r\ndiscoveries; it began with the statement that the study of science\r\nshould not make atheists, if the subject was rightly interpreted.\r\n\r\nMaury often lectured to the students of Virginia Military Institute,\r\nthough he gave no regular courses of instruction; for example, in\r\n1872 he gave a series of lectures to the cadets on “What We Owe\r\nto Science”. The larger number of his addresses were delivered,\r\nhowever, in the interest of the establishment of a system of universal\r\ntelegraphic meteorological observations and crop reports,—the plan\r\nwhich he had urged for many years before the Civil War and which\r\nthat unhappy conflict had cut short. Not long after his return to\r\nVirginia, he began to consider this cherished plan again. “You\r\nremember before the war”, he wrote, “how hard I tried to get up a\r\nTelegraphic Meteorological Bureau—writing and lecturing about it—now\r\nas meteorology for the farmers, now as storm-signals combined with\r\ncrop statistics. When I was in England, during the war, I proposed\r\nto Fitzroy, and after his death to his successor, Toynbee, a plan\r\nfor making, by means of an elastic cloth stretched over his map, a\r\ncaste of the atmosphere, so that he might take in his whole field of\r\nobservation at a single glance, and so predict with more certainty.\r\nSuppose, for instance, with his map pasted on a table, he had bored\r\na hole through London, Liverpool, Portsmouth, etc., and stuck up in\r\neach place a little rod graduated for the barometer; that his elastic\r\ncloth was then fitted to a slide so that he could set it at the\r\nheight of the barometer at each of the stations. Fancy each rod to be\r\nsurmounted by a wind-vane which could be drawn out or shoved in, to\r\nshow the force of the wind at each place. Thus you would have a ‘caste\r\nof the atmosphere’, and see all about it. Brooke—‘deep-sea lead’—has\r\nsuggested just such a plan to Myer (General Albert James Myer of the\r\nSignal Bureau in Washington); and Myer, I have heard, has adopted it.\r\nThe idea, I think, was as original with Brooke as it was with me”.\r\n\r\nThe first address which Maury delivered on the plan for land\r\nmeteorological observations was at the fair of the Memphis\r\nAgricultural and Mechanical Society, on October 17, 1871. In this\r\nspeech he said that he had dropped the subject at Brussels because the\r\nRoyal Society of London had advised against it, but that he had ever\r\nsince regretted this action because he had learned that all Europe had\r\nbeen with him except Bavaria. He then showed how the machinery for\r\nputting the scheme into operation in the United States already existed.\r\n“You have your Signal Office”, he declared, “where weather reports are\r\ncontinually received by telegraph, and whence telegraphic forecasts are\r\nissued daily.... You have also the Agricultural Bureau, in the service\r\nof which reports embodying many of the facts and observations required\r\nare already made, or might be without any additional expense.... Do\r\nyou mean to say that amid all the mind, means, and appliances of the\r\nage, the relations between the weather and the crops are past finding\r\nout? If I could, with just such a system of researches for the sea, sit\r\ndown in my office and tell the navigator how he would find the wind,\r\nat any season of the year, in any part of the ocean through which he\r\nwished to sail, am I promising too much when I tell you that by the\r\nplan I now propose the relation between the weather and the crops is\r\nas capable of scientific development as were the relations between\r\nsea-voyages and the winds twenty-five years ago?” At the close of the\r\naddress, resolutions were offered that the United States government be\r\npetitioned through the State Department in favor of the establishment\r\nthrough international coöperation of a plan of universal telegraphic\r\nmeteorological observations and crop reports, and that another\r\nconference similar to that of Brussels in 1853 be called for that\r\npurpose.\r\n\r\nThe different reaction of two of Maury’s friends to this speech is\r\ninteresting. Rutson Maury wrote, “A large part of your Memphis Address\r\nthat deals with mercantile matters is sheer nonsense.... You ought to\r\nhave some Sancho Panza to accompany you when you go a-tilting”. Being\r\na New Yorker, he would naturally not be in sympathy with an effort\r\nto deflect even a small part of its trade from that metropolis. Dr.\r\nTremlett’s opinion of the speech was more complimentary. “I have”, he\r\nwrote, “read your last ‘spread eagle’ at Memphis. Capital, clever,\r\nbusiness-like like everything you do; but unrealizable”.\r\n\r\nThe address was followed up by the sending of resolutions to various\r\nstate governors, and some attempts were made to gain the coöperation\r\nof officials in Washington. In the latter quarter, however, no headway\r\nwas made, as indicated in the following communication to Maury from\r\nSenator Johnston of Virginia: “I therefore called upon Mr. Watts, the\r\nCommissioner of Agriculture, who scarcely had the civility to hear me.\r\nHe made the conversation very short, and said that he had just ordered\r\nthe meteorological reports which his predecessor had been collecting\r\nand publishing to be discontinued. I ventured mildly to suggest that if\r\nmeteorology did not appertain to his Department, at least Agriculture\r\ndid. He gave this a qualified assent, but told me very positively that\r\nhe would have nothing to do with the proposed scheme. I met with the\r\nsame rebuff in other quarters and fancied that I saw a premeditated\r\nand arranged plan of resistance. Under these circumstances it was\r\nmanifestly useless to move now, and so I have not offered the amendment\r\n(to provide funds for delegates to the International Agricultural\r\nCongress) and will not do so at this session. I am sorry indeed that a\r\nscheme so useful should be so treated”.\r\n\r\nMaury was undaunted by such rebuffs and continued his campaign. On\r\nMay 29, 1872 he addressed the National Agricultural Congress at St.\r\nLouis, declaring that Europe was ripe for such a scheme and citing the\r\nnames of the following influential supporters of it abroad: Alexander\r\nBuchan, Secretary of the Scottish Meteorological Society; Commodore\r\nJansen of Holland; Quetelet, Astronomer Royal and Perpetual Secretary\r\nof the Academy of Sciences of Brussels; Marie Davy, Zurcher, and\r\nMargolle, meteorologists and savants of France; and Father Secchi of\r\nthe Collegio Romano in Italy. The legislatures of Tennessee, Alabama,\r\nMississippi, Missouri, North Carolina, and Virginia, he declared, had\r\npassed resolutions instructing Congress to support an international\r\nconference; and he suggested that they bring further influence to\r\nbear on Congress through state agricultural societies, agricultural\r\njournals, and the general press of the country. He called attention to\r\nthe fact that his interest in the scheme was not a private one, since\r\nhe had no farm, and could not share in the honor of helping to organize\r\nand carry out the plan for the government. He closed with an eloquent\r\nplea, emphasizing the benefits to be derived, which he estimated would\r\nbe as great as those formerly bestowed upon commerce by the results of\r\nthe Brussels Conference.\r\n\r\nOn August 13 of the same year he spoke before the Agricultural\r\nConvention of Georgia at Griffin. Here he covered about the same ground\r\nthat he had in his St. Louis speech, and used the same arguments,\r\nthough the language was different and it was not a mere repetition\r\nof the former address. He also, in it, treated the question of\r\nimmigration, saying that the prejudice which had arisen abroad against\r\nthe South must be removed; and he once more touched upon the old\r\nproblem of better trade communications for that section. This latter\r\nquestion had been in Maury’s mind for years, and he at this time\r\nadvanced bold and original ideas as to the best means of improving\r\nconditions.\r\n\r\nHe declared in one of his letters to Dr. Tremlett that the seat of\r\nempire was fast settling down in the Northwest States. “They already\r\ngive the Presidents”, he wrote, “and will soon dictate the foreign\r\npolicy of the country. They must have a better way to the sea. They\r\nhave been taught to believe—erroneously—that the best way lies\r\nthrough Canada and the St. Lawrence. It does not; it lies through\r\nVirginia. You will appreciate my feeling on this subject, when I remind\r\nyou that grain is sent around Cape Horn from California, and delivered\r\nat the ports along the Atlantic seaboard at ten cents the bushel\r\ncheaper than it can now be sent from Iowa and other Northwest States;\r\nthat the people throughout these states—and they are the grain-growing\r\nstates—know that, with a good highway to the Atlantic seaboard, the\r\nvalue of their grain would be enhanced ten, twenty, even thirty cents\r\nthe bushel; and they think that Canada and the St. Lawrence can give\r\nthem such a way. The greatest difficulty in teaching these people that\r\ntheir best way to the sea lies through Virginia, not through Canada, is\r\nto get our people to raise funds for the gratuitous circulation of the\r\nReports (Preliminary Report on the Resources of Virginia) in sufficient\r\nnumbers between this and the next meeting of Congress in December. If\r\nwe can do that, the Northwest States will raise their voices in favor\r\nof the Virginia route, and demand the money to open it. When that is\r\ndone, they will not want Canada, and we shall have peace. Thus you see,\r\nmy friend, I am aiming high and striking far. But with a few heads such\r\nas yours to help, we would hit the mark as sure as a gun”. Not only in\r\nhis correspondence, but also in the press as well as in his speeches he\r\ncontinued to advocate direct trade between the South and Europe through\r\nthe establishment of a Norfolk to Flushing line of steamers, which\r\nwould turn the tide of immigration toward the Southern States.\r\n\r\nOn the 18th of September, 1872, Maury spoke to the Farmers’ Club of\r\nNorfolk, Massachusetts, near Boston. On this occasion, he made a very\r\ntactful speech with happy references to his old friend John Quincy\r\nAdams, and used only the portions of his previous speeches in favor of\r\nmeteorological and agricultural observations, that were best adapted\r\nto a Northern audience. From here he traveled to St. Louis by way of\r\nNew York, Niagara Falls (Buffalo), Detroit, and Chicago. On October\r\n9, before the St. Louis Agricultural and Mechanical Association at\r\nits annual fair, he spoke as in the year previously on the plan of\r\ninternational coöperation, using the same arguments but adding that at\r\nthe recent International Congress of Statisticians at St. Petersburg,\r\nRussia his scheme had been cheered “by the huzzas of Russians, hochs\r\nof Germans, vivas of Latin races, and the hurrahs of the English”, and\r\nthat a special committee had been appointed to further the movement.\r\n\r\nMaury was so exhausted, however, by the time he reached St. Louis\r\nand was so ill that he could hardly read his address in an audible\r\ntone. As a matter of fact, in the summer preceding this lecture tour\r\nhe had been very ill of the gout and was for a time on crutches.\r\nConsequently, when he reached home after spending some two weeks in St.\r\nLouis, he was too ill to attend the first annual fair of the Seaboard\r\nAgricultural Society, which he was to have addressed at Norfolk,\r\nVirginia, on October 23. His address had already been prepared; and as\r\nit turned out to be his last, its contents are of peculiar interest. He\r\nappealed to the farmers in regard to the necessity of coöperation for\r\nself-protection and redress against transportation monopolies and all\r\nsources of oppression and discouragement; he contended that domestic\r\ncommerce should be attended to by Congress as carefully as foreign\r\ntrade, but that special legislation protected the latter while the\r\nformer was left to the tender mercies of great corporations; he touched\r\nupon his favorite topic of weather observations and crop reports, and\r\nmany other questions such as tolls and tariffs, the government of\r\nrailroads, interior water lines and canal projects, the conjunction\r\nof the Atlantic and the Mississippi River valley, east and west trunk\r\nlines and branches and the ways and means of constructing them without\r\nincrease of taxation, the regulation of commerce between the states,\r\nthe naval establishment and wherein it needed reforms, immigration, and\r\nlabor and capital.\r\n\r\nMaury was destined not to live to see the scheme of meteorological\r\nobservations and crop reports, upon which he had spent so much thought\r\nand labor, in operation; but not long after his death a part of his\r\nprogram was carried out when there was an international conference of\r\nmeteorologists at Vienna in 1873, the United States being represented\r\nby General Albert James Myer of the Signal Service of the Army. There\r\nare, indeed, those who would deny him any part in the establishment of\r\nthe present Weather Bureau. On the contrary, there are others who would\r\ngo to the opposite extreme and give him all the credit for bringing it\r\nabout. For example, Mr. E. P. Dorr, who was at one time an observer\r\nfor the Smithsonian and afterwards President of the Board of Lake\r\nUnderwriters, wrote to Mr. Thompson B. Maury, at that time (1873) in\r\nthe Signal Office, in Washington that Maury’s “intelligent, original\r\nmind invented and suggested the present system of meteorological\r\nobservations; and the writer wishes this in some way to be put upon\r\nrecord, to do justice to the dead Maury, a man whose name and memory\r\nwill live in all civilized countries on the globe, throughout all time,\r\nas an original, great mind.... I could not rest unless I told some one\r\nthat the late M. F. Maury was the originator in design and detail, in\r\nall its parts, of the present system of meteorological observations now\r\nso generally taken all over the country”.\r\n\r\nThe question of due credit is a perplexing one; but certainly no one\r\ncould cavil at the modest claim made by Maury’s son Matthew in the\r\nfollowing letter: “In 1869, Abbé took the question up and began issuing\r\nlocal forecasts from Cincinnati Observatory and out of his success here\r\nand efforts in Washington grew the Weather Bureau in November, 1870,\r\nwith General Myer at its head, to whom belongs the credit of working\r\nup all the details and putting the thing on such a practical footing.\r\nTill now the Washington work is the admiration of all the world as its\r\ndaily charts and reports embrace not only the United States but the\r\nwhole of the northern hemisphere, Australia, and the Cape of Good Hope.\r\nNow I think that any calm mind can only say for Father that he had\r\nthe clearness of foresight to foresee what could be done for the land\r\nwith the aid of regular stations and the telegraph, but we can’t in the\r\nsmallest degree say that its practical success is due to him. In the\r\nfuture, General Myer will have that credit. Father’s reputation must\r\nrest on his work at sea and a biography can only speak of other things\r\nas indications of his clear and far-seeing mind. The world is full of\r\nsimilar cases in all great improvements, and the world invariably gives\r\nthe credit not to the man who first thought of them but to the man who\r\nputs the ideas into practise”.\r\n\r\nWhen Maury was stricken with sickness on his last lecturing tour, he\r\nseemed to realize that he would not recover, for when he arrived at\r\nhome and entered the house he said to his wife, “My dear, I am come\r\nhome to die”. He was immediately helped to his bed, though death did\r\nnot come until after four long months, during a portion of which time\r\nhe suffered extreme pain. When not suffering too much, he occupied\r\nhimself with a revision of his “Physical Geography”.\r\n\r\nDuring his long illness, the strength of his Christian faith displayed\r\nitself, and he became wholly resigned to the inevitable. Job had\r\nalways been his favorite book in the Bible; and the 130th Psalm, which\r\nhe called “De Profundis” and which was sung at Luther’s funeral amid\r\nthe tears of the people, was read to him, at his request, many times\r\nduring his last days. He was greatly comforted by a week’s visit which\r\nhis brother-in-law, Dr. Brodie S. Herndon of Savannah, made him in\r\nthe December preceding his death. And towards the end he sent sincere\r\nfarewell messages to Commodore Jansen in Holland, whom he had loved for\r\nmany years as a brother, and also to Dr. Tremlett who had brightened\r\nwith his friendship the desolate years of his exile in England and had\r\ninfluenced him to enter the communion of the Church. A few days before\r\nhis death he dismissed his physicians, saying, “Don’t come to see me\r\nany more; leave me to the great Physician”.\r\n\r\nHe derived his greatest consolation and satisfaction from having his\r\nfamily about him, for whom he had always shown throughout his life the\r\ntenderest affections of a devoted father and husband. As he talked to\r\nthem, there would come flashes of his quaint playful humor that had\r\nalways been so characteristic of him; and he requested that there be\r\nno weeping in his presence. He rejoiced in being able to recognize all\r\nhis family to the end. “You see”, said he, “how God has answered my\r\nprayers, for I know you every one.... I shall retain my senses to the\r\nlast. God has granted me that as a token of my acceptance. I have set\r\nmy house in order, my prayers have all been answered, my children are\r\ngathered round my bed—and now Lord, what wait I for?” Then he would\r\nrepeat the prayer which he had composed thirty years before when his\r\nleg was broken, and which he had repeated in his daily devotions ever\r\nsince: “Lord Jesus, thou Son of God and Redeemer of the world, have\r\nmercy upon me! Pardon my offenses, and teach me the error of my ways;\r\ngive me a new heart and a right mind. Teach me and all mine to do Thy\r\nwill, and in all things to keep Thy law. Teach me also to ask those\r\nthings necessary for eternal life. Lord, pardon me for all my sins, for\r\nThine is the kingdom and the power and the glory, for ever and ever,\r\nAmen”.\r\n\r\nOn the evening before his death, the family sang for him verses from\r\nhis favorite hymn, “Christ Is Risen”, which he called “Pass over\r\nJordan”, and also from “How Firm a Foundation”. After the singing\r\nhe said so that all could hear, “The peace of God which passeth all\r\nunderstanding be with you all—all!” Toward the end he inquired of his\r\nson Richard, “Are my feet growing cold? Do I drag my anchors?” Upon\r\nreceiving an affirmative answer, he said, “All’s well”. About fifteen\r\nminutes before he died, his wife and daughters were requested by him to\r\nleave the room, and he was left with his two sons and two sons-in-law.\r\nAt 12.40 P.M., on Saturday, February 1, 1873, his life came to a close.\r\n\r\nThe body lay in state in the hall of the Library of Virginia Military\r\nInstitute from four o’clock in the afternoon of Monday until Wednesday.\r\nThe gallery round the hall was festooned with black, a large anchor\r\nand a cross of evergreens being placed at alternate angles; while\r\nthe columns were draped spirally. The wall was covered with maps\r\nconstructed under Maury’s supervision, and on opposite sides of the\r\ngallery were placed two heavily draped flags, the one being that of\r\nhis native state Virginia, and the other that of his adopted state\r\nTennessee. In the center of the hall rested the bier, bearing his body,\r\nwith his breast covered with the foreign orders that had been conferred\r\nupon him, and with a gentle smile on his face. Near the bier stood a\r\nlarge globe bearing this appropriate inscription: “The whole world is\r\nmourning for Maury”.\r\n\r\nA funeral service was held in the hall on Wednesday about noon, by the\r\nReverend William Pendleton, D. D. of Grace Church, after which the\r\ncoffin, attended by the cadet battalion and the faculty of Virginia\r\nMilitary Institute and the professors and students of Washington\r\nand Lee University[26] and the citizens of Lexington, was conveyed\r\nto the Gilham vault in the city cemetery, just opposite the tomb of\r\n“Stonewall” Jackson. This, however, was only a temporary resting-place.\r\nWhen, shortly before his death, his wife had requested of Maury that\r\nshe be permitted to bury him in Richmond, he had replied, “Very well,\r\nmy dear; then let my body remain here until the spring, and when you\r\ntake me through the Goshen Pass you must pluck the rhododendrons and\r\nthe mountain-ivy and lay them upon me”.\r\n\r\n    “Home, bear me home, at last”, he said,\r\n      “And lay me where your dead are lying;\r\n    But not while skies are overspread,\r\n      And mournful wintry winds are sighing!\r\n\r\n    Wait till the royal march of spring\r\n      Carpets the mountain fastness over—\r\n    Till chattering birds are on the wing,\r\n      And buzzing bees are in the clover.\r\n\r\n    Wait till the laurel bursts its buds,\r\n      And creeping ivy flings its graces\r\n    About the lichened rocks—and floods\r\n      Of sunshine fill the shady places.\r\n\r\n    Then, when the sky, the air, the grass,\r\n      Sweet nature all, is glad and tender—\r\n    Then bear me through the Goshen Pass,\r\n      Amid the hush of May-day splendor”.[27]\r\n\r\nIt was the following autumn, however, before Maury’s wishes could be\r\ncarried out. In bearing his remains to Richmond at that time, the\r\nfamily were escorted as far as the river, about a mile from Lexington,\r\nby the corps of cadets, the professors of the Institute, and a great\r\nmany other friends who thus wished to show their love and respect for\r\nthe great scientist. Some, among whom was Superintendent Francis H.\r\nSmith of V. M. I., accompanied the cortege as far as Goshen Pass.\r\nIn going from Lexington to what was then the nearest station on the\r\nChesapeake and Ohio Railway, one passed through this lovely gorge where\r\nthe North Anna River forces its way through the mountains some fifteen\r\nmiles from Lexington. When the cortege reached the Pass, the carriages\r\nwere stopped and members of the family gathered branches of the\r\nrhododendron and laurel and bright yellow maple, and decked the hearse\r\nwith them, as Maury had requested.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _Courtesy of Governor Byrd and of the Virginia State Chamber of\r\n  Commerce._\r\n\r\n  MAURY MONUMENT IN THE BEAUTIFUL GOSHEN PASS, ON THE BANK OF THE\r\n  NORTH ANNA RIVER, ERECTED BY THE STATE OF VIRGINIA IN 1923\r\n\r\n  See page 246]\r\n\r\n  The bronze tablet on the monument shown on the opposite side of\r\n  this page bears the following inscription:\r\n\r\n                        MATTHEW FONTAINE MAURY\r\n\r\n                        Pathfinder of the Seas\r\n                     The Genius who first Snatched\r\n                        From Ocean & Atmosphere\r\n                       The Secret of their Laws.\r\n\r\n                        Born January 14th, 1806\r\n              Died at Lexington, Va., February 1st, 1873\r\n               Carried through Goshen Pass To His Final\r\n                 Resting Place in Richmond, Virginia.\r\n\r\n                             Every Mariner\r\n                          For Countless Ages\r\n                    As he takes his Chart to Shape\r\n                      His course across the Seas,\r\n                          Will think of thee\r\n\r\n                       His Inspiration Holy Writ\r\n\r\n                  Psalms 8 & 107, Verses 8, 23, & 24\r\n                     Ecclesiastes Chap. 1, Verse 8\r\n                     A Tribute by his Native State\r\n                               Virginia\r\n                                 1923\r\n\r\n                            His Last Words\r\n                      “Carry My Body Through The\r\n                      Pass When the Rhododendron\r\n                             is in Bloom.”]\r\n\r\nThey arrived in Richmond on Saturday, September 27. The burial in\r\nHollywood Cemetery was private, Maury’s last resting-place being\r\nbetween the tombs of Ex-Presidents Monroe and Tyler, on a beautiful\r\nknoll overlooking the James River. “The lot we have in Hollywood”,\r\nwrote Maury’s son Matthew, “I like particularly because it faces the\r\nbright green country and overlooks the rapids of the James River, the\r\nsleeper there being always lulled by the murmur of running water,\r\na sound which he so loved to hear”. Maury’s monument in Hollywood\r\nCemetery bears the following inscription: In Memory of Matthew Fontaine\r\nMaury—Born in Spottsylvania Co., Virginia January 14th, 1806—Died\r\nin Lexington, Virginia February 1st, 1873—“All is well”, Maury. On\r\nanother side of the shaft are these words: Entered the Navy of the\r\nUnited States 1825—That of the Confederate States 1861—Author of\r\n“Maury’s Sailing Directions” and “The Physical Geography of the Sea”.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\n                       HIS POSTHUMOUS REPUTATION\r\n\r\n\r\nImmediately after Maury’s death there was a veritable flood of eulogies\r\nof the character and services of the great scientist. They were by\r\nno means confined to the colleges, legislators, and newspapers of\r\nVirginia; but the scientific journals throughout the world made known\r\nin unmistakable terms the high estimation in which he was held. For\r\nexample, the British journal _Nature_ of March 20, 1873, declared that\r\nMaury was the first to show how meteorology could be raised to the\r\ndignity of a science, and that he was essentially a practical man in\r\nthe highest sense of the term. “He will certainly”, it added, “and\r\ndeservedly, occupy a niche in the temple of fame as a benefactor of\r\nhumanity and a promoter of scientific knowledge, to which not many men\r\never attain”. It is difficult to resist the temptation to quote other\r\nextracts from the dozens of highly commendatory appraisals of Maury’s\r\nachievements and character, which appeared soon after his death. But\r\nsuch is unnecessary, if this biography has with a reasonable degree\r\nof success given an understandable account of his work and revealed\r\nthrough the assistance of his letters the sterling character of the man.\r\n\r\nAfter this flood of eulogy had subsided, a period of some fifteen\r\nyears followed during which Maury’s name was wrapped in comparative\r\nforgetfulness. Then, there appeared in 1888 the “Life of Maury” by his\r\ndaughter Diana Fontaine Maury Corbin, and the reviews of that volume\r\nonce again brought his name into the literary and scientific journals\r\nwhere the praises of former years were repeated. The _Athenaeum_ of\r\nJuly 21, 1888, after pointing out how Maury’s meteorological work\r\nhad come to be unduly depreciated, declared, “The work (_Physical\r\nGeography of the Sea_) remains one of undoubted genius—great if only\r\nfor the impulse which it gave to the study of this particular branch\r\nof physical geography and for the enormous advance in the science of\r\nmeteorology which we owe to it”. The _Saturday Review_ of October 20,\r\n1888 said that scientific navigation was almost non-existant before\r\nMaury’s work and that he had improved the course of every ship on the\r\nsea. It would be tedious to quote further from these reviews, and it\r\nwill be sufficient to state that they were unanimous in their opinion\r\nthat Maury deserved high rank among the great scientists of the world\r\nbecause of his pioneer work in the field of oceanography.\r\n\r\nIn this connection, there is a letter which, because of the fame of\r\nits author as well as the pertinence of its contents, is of peculiar\r\ninterest. Thomas Nelson Page, the distinguished Virginia novelist,\r\nwrote to Mrs. Matthew Fontaine Maury,[28] on the receipt of a copy of\r\nMrs. Corbin’s biography of her father, as follows: “Please accept my\r\nthanks for the biography of your distinguished husband which will be\r\nan addition to our library both on account of its literary merit and\r\nof the information it contains of one of our greatest men. I trust you\r\nmay live to see the services he rendered mankind suitably commemorated\r\nby a monument worthy of him. But whether you do or not, the time will\r\nassuredly come when he will be recognized by our people as an honor to\r\nthe race from which he sprang. I esteem it one of my privileges that\r\nin my youth I knew personally two such men as General Lee and your\r\nhonored husband”.\r\n\r\nFor many years repeated attempts have been made to erect such an\r\nadequate monument to Maury as the one mentioned in Page’s letter.\r\nImmediately after Maury’s death, at the suggestion of Rear Admiral\r\nMarin H. Jansen of Holland, some steps were taken toward the building\r\nof a lighthouse on the Rocas Banks near the coast of Brazil, as a\r\nfitting memorial to the great oceanographer. But the plan did not\r\nsucceed, as foreign geographic societies wished the movement to\r\noriginate in America, and this country, when approached on the matter,\r\nwas found unsympathetic toward the undertaking. The renewed interest\r\nin Maury which was caused by Mrs. Corbin’s biography led to an effort\r\nin 1890 to induce Congress to appropriate $20,000 to erect a monument\r\nto Maury in Washington; but this attempt was not successful. Then, the\r\nDaughters of the American Revolution began a movement, which lasted\r\nfor about fifteen years, to interest the government in building an\r\nappropriate monument in the nature of a lighthouse upon the Rip-Raps in\r\nHampton Roads, off Old Point Comfort, Virginia. A final effort was made\r\nto have the memorial built and to arrange for its unveiling during the\r\nJamestown Exposition in 1907; but failure again met all endeavors.\r\n\r\nIn 1915 it was suggested by the Superintendent of the Naval\r\nObservatory that a memorial building in Maury’s honor to accommodate\r\nthe Hydrographic Office and some of the Observatory activities be\r\nerected on the Naval Observatory grounds, but the suggestion brought\r\nno tangible results. On May 11 of that year, however, the Matthew\r\nFontaine Maury Association[29] was organized in Richmond, with three\r\nspecific objects in mind. The first was to have Maury’s name placed\r\nin the Hall of Fame of New York University. In this they have not as\r\nyet succeeded, but in the election of 1925 Maury’s name came sixth,\r\nwith fifty-two out of the one hundred votes cast. The two successful\r\ncandidates, John Paul Jones and Edwin Booth, received sixty-eight\r\nand eighty-five votes respectively; while the other three who were\r\nahead of Maury were John Jay with fifty-nine votes, Samuel Adams with\r\nfifty-eight, and “Stonewall” Jackson with fifty-three. The second\r\nobject of the Maury Association was to induce the State Board of\r\nEducation of Virginia to appoint January 14th—Maury’s birthday—as\r\nMaury Day in the schools; this was done June 27, 1916. Their third and\r\nmost ambitious undertaking was the erection of a bronze statue of Maury\r\nin Richmond. In this effort slow but steady progress was made. The\r\nVirginia legislature contributed $10,000, and after the close of the\r\nWorld War the United Daughters of the Confederacy gave their support\r\nto the raising of funds. The school children of Virginia gave $2000,\r\nand many others contributed generously. Accordingly, the sum of $60,000\r\nhas now been raised, and the monument will in the near future be put in\r\nplace at the intersection of Belmont and Monument Avenues in Richmond,\r\nwhere the corner stone was laid with appropriate ceremonies on June 22,\r\n1922. A tentative model of this monument has been made by the sculptor,\r\nMr. F. William Sievers, and approved by the committee in charge of the\r\nmemorial. For description of this monument please see footnote, end of\r\nchapter, page 251.\r\n\r\nA long list of minor memorials to Maury have appeared from time to\r\ntime. One of the oldest is his portrait in fresco on the ceiling of\r\nthe Library of the State Capitol of Tennessee in Nashville, which\r\nwas painted in 1857. His name, among six or seven others, adorns the\r\nexterior of the building of the Seaman’s Institute, overlooking the\r\nElbe, in Hamburg, Germany; while the University of Virginia has his\r\nname inscribed on the frieze of its new Rotunda. There are a number of\r\nother memorials in Maury’s native state. In Lexington at the Virginia\r\nMilitary Institute there is a Maury-Brooke Hall in which the physical\r\nsciences are taught. In Richmond, the house in which he invented\r\nthe electric mine has been marked, and in South Richmond a street,\r\na cemetery, and an elementary school all bear his name. Norfolk has\r\na Matthew Fontaine Maury High School; while Fredericksburg has its\r\nMaury Hotel, and has marked the house where he resided for several\r\nyears. In Goshen Pass, a tablet in Maury’s honor was unveiled on\r\nJune 9, 1923. The bronze tablet is attached to a granite shaft about\r\neight feet tall, at the base of which is to be placed an anchor,\r\nweighing 1500 pounds, and 90 feet of chain, of a type used in Maury’s\r\ntime and donated by the Virginia Pilot Association of Norfolk. This\r\nmemorial, which was designed and constructed by the sculptor Guiseppe\r\nMoretti, was authorized by the Legislature of Virginia. In the state\r\nof his adoption, there is only one recent memorial, a tablet in his\r\nhonor, placed on the walls of the Public School Building in Franklin,\r\nTennessee, by the Old Glory Chapter of the Daughters of the American\r\nRevolution.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n  _Courtesy of the Commanding Officer, Commander James B. Glennon, U.\r\n  S. N._\r\n\r\n  DESTROYER U. S. S. “MAURY,” NAMED IN HONOR OF MAURY]\r\n\r\nIn the United States Navy there has been considerable recognition of\r\nMaury since his death,—particularly in recent years. His name is\r\nplaced at the top of all the charts issued by the Hydrographic Office,\r\nin the following phrase: “Founded upon the researches made and the data\r\ncollected by Lieutenant M. F. Maury, U. S. Navy”. In 1918 a destroyer\r\nin the U. S. Navy was called the _Maury_, and recently the Secretary\r\nof the Navy has named the Naval Oceanographic Research in his honor.\r\nAt the United States Naval Academy at Annapolis, the left wing of the\r\nAcademic Building bears the name of Maury Hall. This was originally the\r\nnavigation wing of the building, and, according to the Superintendent\r\nof the Academy (Captain W. F. Fullam, U. S. Navy, in 1915), it was\r\nnamed by his direction “Maury Hall” because of “Maury’s distinguished\r\nand world-wide reputation in connection with meteorology and the\r\nstudy of ocean currents, etc.” In 1919, the United Daughters of the\r\nConfederacy established a prize at the Naval Academy, consisting of a\r\npair of marine binoculars, to be known as the “Maury Prize” and to be\r\nawarded annually to that midshipman of the First Class who has shown\r\nsuperior excellence in electrical engineering and physics. A portrait\r\nof Maury by E. Sophonisba Hergesheimer was presented to the Naval\r\nAcademy by the Daughters of the Confederacy, Atlanta Chapter, Georgia\r\nDivision, and unveiled on November 20, 1923.[30]\r\n\r\nOne of the most recent memorials to Maury is as interesting as it\r\nis appropriate. On December 22, 1925, the Martin Vas Isles (Ilhas\r\nda Martin Vas) were visited by the Schooner _Blossom_ of the South\r\nAtlantic Expedition which was sent out by the Cleveland Museum of\r\nNatural History for the purpose of collecting specimens from the\r\nvolcanic islands of the South Atlantic. These islands, individually\r\nunnamed and hitherto imperfectly charted, lie about eight hundred\r\nmiles off the coast of Brazil in the direction of Africa (latitude 20°\r\n31′ S., longitude 28° 51′ W.). Captain George Finlay Simmons of the\r\n_Blossom_ and his associates, impressed with the importance of the work\r\ndone by Maury, decided to give his name to one of the three islands of\r\nthe group which rises from the ocean like an impressive monument.\r\n\r\nAll of these memorials, so varied in their nature and so widely\r\ndistributed, would seem to indicate that Maury’s name is by no means\r\nlikely to be forgotten. Still, his name and his achievements are not\r\nso generally known, even in the United States, as they deserve to be.\r\n“For myself”, wrote Julian Street[31] a few years ago, “I must confess\r\nthat, until I visited Virginia, I was ignorant of the fact that such\r\na person had existed; nor have Northern schoolboys, to whom I have\r\nspoken of Maury, so much as heard his name. Yet there is not one living\r\nin the United States or in any civilized country, whose daily life is\r\nnot affected through the scientific researches and attainments of this\r\nman”. One is surprised, however, sometimes to find foreign authors\r\nmore familiar with Maury’s name, and to meet with references to him\r\nwhere one might least expect any knowledge of his scientific work. For\r\nexample, in Walter de la Mare’s “Memoirs of a Midget” (p. 226), the\r\nreader is unexpectedly confronted with this: “I searched Mrs. Bowater’s\r\nlibrary for views of the sea, but without much reward. So I read over\r\nMr. Bowater’s Captain Maury—on the winds and monsoons and tide-rips\r\nand hurricanes, freshened up my _Robinson Crusoe_, and dreamed of the\r\nAngels with the Vials”. Another example, almost equally unexpected is\r\nto be found in Vicente Blasco Ibanez’s “Mare Nostrum” (p. 65). “He\r\n(Ulysses) had learned English”, writes Ibanez, “the universal language\r\nof the blue dominions, and was refreshing himself with a study of\r\nMaury’s charts—the sailor’s Bible—the patient work of an obscure\r\ngenius who first snatched from ocean and atmosphere the secret of their\r\nlaws”.\r\n\r\nIn recent scientific works, however, such as “The Depths of the Sea”\r\nby Sir John Murray and Dr. Johan Hjort, “Science of the Sea” edited by\r\nG. Herbert Fowler, and “Founders of Oceanography” by Sir William A.\r\nHerdman one is not surprised to find full justification for referring\r\nto Maury as “The Pathfinder of the Seas”, for marine meteorology,\r\nthey declare, may be said to date from his time. Not only is this\r\ntitle appropriate in that Maury laid out on his charts the best tracks\r\nfor voyagers to follow on the Seven Seas, but it is also fitting in\r\na figurative sense for he was indeed a pathfinder in the realm of a\r\nnew science,—the physical geography of the sea. This phrase was,\r\ntherefore, rightly chosen to be placed on the memorial tablet in Goshen\r\nPass as well as on the one at Franklin, Tennessee, and it is to be\r\nprominently inscribed on the monument soon to be erected to him in\r\nRichmond. This beautifully poetic title, “The Pathfinder of the Seas”,\r\nwill be his real monument against which the tooth of time will gnaw in\r\nvain, for it will rest solidly based upon his original contributions to\r\nthe science of the world: “The Physical Geography of the Sea” and the\r\n“Wind and Current Charts” with their “Sailing Directions”.\r\n\r\nIt is not so easy, on the other hand, to describe in a phrase Maury’s\r\npersonality. Some of those who knew him well thought his most\r\ncharacteristic trait was his modesty; others considered “masculine\r\ncommon sense”, which enabled him to see things in their true light and\r\ntheir real bearing, most fully characterized him; while still another\r\ndeclared that he belonged to that class of men who are _sans peur et\r\nsans reproche_. But his character had too many facets for such a simple\r\ncharacterization, and one is forced to turn to a more detailed summary.\r\nPerhaps, the most nearly satisfying one of this sort is that written by\r\nFrancis H. Smith, formerly Professor of Physics at the University of\r\nVirginia and one who was well acquainted with Maury and his scientific\r\nwork.\r\n\r\n“Of Maury’s personality”, Professor Smith wrote, “it may be said that\r\nno one that had the privilege of meeting him ever forgot the event.\r\nHe had the winning manner and kindly address which seemed to belong\r\nto the men of his race and section. No worthy young fellow ever felt\r\nignored or oppressed in his presence. He wore his honors easily, but\r\nwhile he valued the public tributes he received, he was not fond of\r\ndisplaying the insignia which came with them. He would put on those\r\njewels sometimes in the privacy of home to gratify his children. He\r\nloved the little ones, and if to be childlike is to be perfect he was\r\ncharmingly complete. His conversation was interesting to the thoughtful\r\nin the richness of the lessons he drew from common things. He would\r\ncouple facts, regarded by others as unconnected, and thereby disclose\r\nunsuspected relations. It takes genius to make the rejected refuse of\r\none generation the valuable ore of a succeeding one. This detection of\r\na hidden meaning in the simplest matters shows the inexhaustible nature\r\nof truth, and is the mark of a superior mind”.[32]\r\n\r\n  PUBLISHER’S NOTE: Permission has been granted to print the\r\n  following portion of Miss Virginia Lee Cox’s description of the\r\n  Maury Monument soon to be erected in Richmond, Virginia:\r\n\r\n  “It is a marvelous conception of the man who was admired as the\r\n  ‘Pathfinder of the Seas,’ and beloved for his humanity. Just how\r\n  wonderful it is, is proved in the words of Commodore Maury’s own\r\n  daughter, Mrs. James R. Werth, who, when she saw the finished\r\n  figure of Mr. Sievers’ skill, said: ‘I feel as if I am sitting in\r\n  the presence of my father in flesh, blood, and spirit; I feel as if\r\n  I could put my arms around his neck as I did when I was a little\r\n  girl.’\r\n\r\n  “The sculptor has portrayed Maury in a reminiscent attitude,\r\n  listening to the voice of the storm. It has been said of him that\r\n  the voice of the wind and waves was music to his ears and Mr.\r\n  Sievers, with fine sympathy and originality, built on much study of\r\n  the man, has succeeded in showing this.\r\n\r\n  “Above the figure of Maury, which is seated in a great chair,\r\n  there is a group of figures which supports the globe. The figures\r\n  represent a storm on land and sea. At one corner of the monument is\r\n  an ox around which cluster the windswept figures of the farmer and\r\n  his household, driven before the fury of the storm.\r\n\r\n  “At the other corner is an overturned boat and figures of women\r\n  and sailors, drenched in the thundering waves of the sea. The\r\n  group embraces a symbolization of the world and its natural\r\n  elements. Through the allegorization three of Maury’s outstanding\r\n  achievements are brought well to the foreground—meteorology,\r\n  hydrography, and geography.\r\n\r\n  “The storm is a meteorological disturbance, and the capsized\r\n  lifeboat with its occupants amid the rolling waves is symbolic\r\n  of ocean meteorology, a branch of hydrography, symbolized also\r\n  in the “paths of the sea” on the globe, that naturally represent\r\n  geography.\r\n\r\n  “On the plinth of the monument in the flattest relief are figures\r\n  of fish, representing Maury’s interest in the paths of the sea. The\r\n  story goes that once when Maury was ill he had his son read the\r\n  Bible to him each night. One night he read the eighth Psalm, and\r\n  when he came to the passage—‘The fishes of the sea and whatsoever\r\n  walketh through the paths of the sea’—Maury had him read it over\r\n  several times. Finally he said, ‘If God says there are paths in the\r\n  sea I am going to find them if I get out of this bed.’ Thus the\r\n  Psalm was the direct inspiration for his discoveries.\r\n\r\n  “Mr. Sievers has shown Maury in a reminiscent mood, representing\r\n  him at that period of his life when he had achieved his greatest\r\n  discoveries. In his right hand are the pencil and the compass,\r\n  and in his left hand a chart. Against his chair is the Bible,\r\n  from which he drew inspiration for his explorations. The sculptor\r\n  has caught amazingly the spirit of the man.”—From Richmond (Va.)\r\n  _Times_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            LIST OF LETTERS\r\n\r\n                      (Quoted in full or in part)\r\n\r\n\r\n  Maury to (?), March, 1856, 4\r\n\r\n  Maury to Sally Fontaine, October 26, 1866, 5\r\n\r\n  Maury to Frank Minor, October 30, 1859, 5\r\n\r\n  Maury to Frank Minor, November 5, 1859, 5\r\n\r\n  Maury to William Hasbrouck, March 13, 1866, 9\r\n\r\n  Maury to William Hasbrouck, April 14, 1865, 9\r\n\r\n  Maury to Rutson Maury, August 31, 1840, 12\r\n\r\n  Maury to N.

In a lecture on “Man’s Power-giving Knowledge”, delivered  |\r\n| by him to Virginia Military Institute students on January 23,      |\r\n| 1871, he said, “After the burning of the Norfolk Navy Yard in      |\r\n| 1861, the Governor’s Council advised that the _Merrimac_ should    |\r\n| be raised and converted into an ironclad. Quick to perceive and    |\r\n| prompt to act, as in the emergencies of the war he ever was, his   |\r\n| Excellency caused it to be done”. This is corroborated by the      |\r\n| following entry in the minutes of the Council for May 11, 1861,    |\r\n| for a meeting at which Maury was present: “Governor submitted for  |\r\n| approval a proposal of B. and I.

After      |\r\n| becoming insane, she was taken to the Château de Bouchout in       |\r\n| Brabant, Belgium, where she continued to write pathetic love       |\r\n| letters to her “dearest Maximilian”, whom she did not realize to   |\r\n| have been dead. Death came to her at the age of eighty-six, on     |\r\n| January 19, 1927. During the World War, a heavy guard was placed   |\r\n| around her villa by order of the Kaiser and this placard set       |\r\n| up: “This villa is the property of Her Majesty the Empress of      |\r\n| Mexico, sister of His Majesty Francis Joseph, Kaiser of Austria.   |\r\n| Disturbances in the neighborhood will be punished with the utmost  |\r\n| severity”.                                                         |\r\n|                                                                    |\r\n| [24] It has often been stated that the poet Tennyson received      |\r\n| the LL.D. from Cambridge at this same time.

As an example, take the square\r\nbetween 5° & 10° N. and 20° & 25° W. The figures in the N.E. corner\r\nof the circumscribed square show that in this square, there have been\r\nexamined 294 records of the winds in Dec; 212 in Jan; & 161 in Feb; and\r\nthe numbers 33, 18, 8, in the N.E. quadrant of the inner circle, show\r\nthat it was calm 33 times in_ addition _to the 294 winds in Dec; 13\r\ntimes in Jan; and 8 times in Feb._\r\n\r\n_These are the_ winter _months; and the number of times that the wind\r\nhas been found to blow from the several points of the compass, in the\r\nwinter months, is entered in the space between the two_ outer _circles.\r\nThe radii show the points of the compass; the figures between the radii\r\nshow the number of times, for each month, the wind has been timed to\r\nprevail from such points for as much as eight hours together. Thus,\r\nbetween the two heavily drawn radii opening to the North, the winds\r\nfrom N. by W. to N. by E. are entered as North winds. Between the right\r\nhand line of these two and the broken radius to the right of that\r\nagain, the winds between N. by E. & N.E. by N. are entered as winds\r\nfrom N.N.E. Between this broken radius and the next one on the right\r\nare the winds from N.E. and so on, with the sun, around the sixteen\r\npoints of the compass. All the winds between N. by W. and N. by E. are\r\ncalled North winds; those between E. by N. and E. by S. are entered as\r\nfrom E. & so on._\r\n\r\n_Referring again to the same square, and to the two heavily drawn radii\r\nopening to the North, the numbers 20, 8, 16, between the two outer\r\ncircles, mean, that 20 of the 294 winds in Dec, 8 of the 217 in Jan,\r\nand 16 of the 161 in Feb. were North. In Dec, the winds blew also 36\r\ntimes from N.N.E; 37, N.E; 51, E.N.E; 60, E; 21, E.S.E; 17, S.E; 10,\r\nS.S.E; 6, S; and so on._\r\n\r\n_Proceeding towards the centre, the next inter-circular space contains\r\nthe winds, according to their direction, for the three spring months.\r\nThe figures in the S.E. corner of the circumscribed square show the\r\ntotal number of winds recorded for each month, as 159 for March; 227\r\nfor April, and 301 for May, exclusive of 4, 5, 12, calms in the S.E.\r\nquadrant for the same months, and so on, around with the sun, for calms\r\nand number of winds, in the order of the months; beginning with the\r\nfirst number in the N.E. corner and quadrant, as the total winds and\r\ncalms for December, the 2ⁿᵈ numbers for January and so on._\r\n\r\n_The third space between the circles contains the winds for the three\r\nsummer months in the same order, June, July and August, between the\r\nradii. The space between the two inner circles is for Autumn; the outer\r\nround of figures being the winds for Sept, and the inner for Nov.\r\nDiagram A is referred to for further explanation. In it the months are\r\nwritten instead of the number of winds and calms for each month and\r\npoint of compass._\r\n\r\n_The method, in which the number and direction of the winds have been\r\nascertained, is this: As many logs as could be obtained have been\r\nexamined; the 24 hours have been divided into three parts of eight\r\nhours each; and, according to the square in which the vessel was,\r\nthe_ prevailing direction _of the wind for every eight hours has been\r\nentered as one wind_.\r\n\r\n_Thus, in the square between 5° & 10° N. and 15° & 20° W. we see, in\r\nthe S.W. corner 916 winds, and in the S.W. quadrant, 15 calms. These\r\nare the total number of intervals of eight hours each for which the\r\nwinds and calms for August have been examined in this 5° square of the\r\nocean. Consequently, all the vessels passing through this square in the\r\nmonth of August were in it, 310⅓ days. Compare the totals for August\r\nin the adjacent squares, with this 916 and reasons will appear for the\r\nconclusion that the winds here in August, are particularly light and\r\nbattling, and that the vessels were detained so long in this square on\r\nthat account._\r\n\r\n_The blank spaces, or the spaces that are filled up in some of the\r\nsquares and circles and not in others, mean that no winds have been\r\nreported in the logs from these points of the compass, or that no calms\r\nprevailing for eight hours together, have been reported during those\r\nmonths._\r\n\r\n_Diagram B is for the convenience of the navigator. Make a fac simile\r\nand cut out the black part. Now to ascertain the chances for head and\r\nfair winds in any part of the ocean, lay this card over the circles in\r\nthe square in which the vessel may be, with the white pointer mid-way\r\nbetween the two radii that represent the course to be sailed. The winds\r\nthat can be counted for the month, in the segment that has been cut\r\nfrom the card, will show the chances for head winds; and this number,\r\nsubtracted from the total for the month, will show the chances for fair\r\nwinds. Calms speak for themselves._\r\n\r\n_Navigators using this chart, either to lay off their best rout for\r\nthe month, or to decide upon which tack to go, when the winds come out\r\nahead, will know what difference to make between the chances for winds\r\nthat will enable them to lay within 4 points of their course, and the\r\nchances for winds that will enable them to lay within two points of\r\ntheir course. In sailing 10 miles, a ship, within six points of her\r\ncourse, makes but 3.8 good.

A.—NOVEMBER, 1927.\r\n\r\n  Printed October 15, 1927\r\n\r\n  Prepared from data furnished by the HYDROGRAPHIC OFFICE of the\r\n  NAVY DEPARTMENT and by the WEATHER BUREAU of the DEPARTMENT OF\r\n  AGRICULTURE.\r\n\r\n  [Legislative Act, June 17, 1910.]\r\n\r\n  Published at the HYDROGRAPHIC OFFICE under the authority of the\r\n  SECRETARY OF THE NAVY Washington, D. C.\r\n\r\n  NOTE.—On the back of this chart will be found an article on “Fog\r\n  at Sea.”\r\n\r\n  Price 10 cents\r\n  No. 1400]\r\n\r\n\r\n=1.=     AVERAGE CONDITIONS OF WIND AND WEATHER OVER THE NORTH\r\n                    ATLANTIC OCEAN DURING NOVEMBER\r\n\r\nPRESSURE.—Pressure continues only moderately high along middle\r\nlatitudes, but the crest to the southwestward of the Azores has\r\nincreased to 30.15 inches. Off the coast of the United States the\r\nisobar of 30.10 inches extends farther eastward into the ocean than\r\nin October. A belt of moderately low pressure, 29.90 inches, extends\r\nin low latitudes across the ocean into the Caribbean Sea. The Iceland\r\nLow continues to deepen and the isobar of 29.70 inches appears in the\r\nposition occupied by the 29.80 line of the previous month.\r\n\r\nTEMPERATURE.—The temperature has fallen 10° to 18° along the American\r\ncoast and on the Gulf of Mexico except off central and southern\r\nFlorida, and 3° to 8° over the British Isles and off western Europe.\r\nElsewhere the changes have been unimportant. Sharp contrasts in\r\ntemperature appear off the American coast, the temperature ranging from\r\n30° in the Gulf of St. Lawrence to 75° at Key West. Along the northern\r\ntrans-Atlantic routes the mean is from 45° to 55°. In the greater\r\nportion of the Caribbean Sea and east of it, between the 15th parallel\r\nand the Equator, the temperature is about 80°.\r\n\r\nWESTERLY WINDS.—North of the 35th parallel the winds are fresh, with\r\ngreatest percentage from the westerly quadrants, although they shift\r\nconsiderably with the passage of cyclonic storms.\r\n\r\nNorthwesterly winds sweep the American coast from the Gulf of St.\r\nLawrence to Hatteras. South of Hatteras they become northerly to\r\nnortheasterly, merging with the trades south of Jupiter.\r\n\r\nTHE TRADE WINDS.—West of the 30th meridian the northeast trades lie\r\nmainly between the 5th and 26th parallels, but east of that meridian\r\nthey are farther north, and the southern and northern limits touch the\r\nAfrican coast at latitudes 12° and 32° N., respectively. A pronounced\r\ntype of these trades occurs between the Cape Verde and Canary Islands.\r\nIn mid-ocean the trades are easterly, but again become northeasterly\r\nover the West Indies, the Caribbean Sea, and the Gulf of Mexico.\r\n\r\nThe southeast trades extend about 4° north of the Equator west of the\r\n15th meridian. East of that meridian, in the same latitude, the winds\r\nbecome southerly, and in the Gulf of Guinea, south-southwesterly.\r\n\r\nGALES AND CALMS.—With the approach of winter, there has been a\r\nmoderate increase in the percentage of gales north of the 35th\r\nparallel, except near the Azores, where it is less than during October.\r\n\r\nGales are infrequent south of latitude 35° N., and only seventeen West\r\nIndia hurricanes have been observed during the 39-year period 1887 to\r\n1925.\r\n\r\nCalms are of highest percentage between the 5th and 10th parallels and\r\nnorthward along the African coast to the Canary Islands.\r\n\r\nFOG.—The percentage of fog has diminished generally since October,\r\nalthough the area of highest percentage, 30 to 35 per cent of days,\r\ncontinues to the southeast of Newfoundland with little change. A light\r\nincrease has occurred in the English Channel.\r\n\r\n\r\n=2.=   KEY TO THE NOVEMBER STORM TRACKS AS SHOWN UPON THIS CHART\r\n\r\n  ======+======================+================\r\n    No. |         Dates        |  Begins near—\r\n  ------+----------------------+----------------\r\n        |                      |   °       °\r\n  I     | Oct. 24-Nov. 2, 1912 |  41 N.   75 W.\r\n  II    | Nov. 12–20, 1912     |  12      80\r\n  III   |      19–21, 1912     |  40      57\r\n  IV    |       6–10, 1913     |  53      45\r\n  V     |      12–15, 1916     |  11      80\r\n  VI    |      18–19, 1919     |  22      78\r\n  VII   |      16–19, 1920     |  24      86\r\n  VIII  |      28-Dec. 2, 1920 |  34      80\r\n  IX    |      10–13, 1921     |  40      68\r\n  X     |       9–14, 1924     |  19      77\r\n  XI    |      10–12, 1924     |  40      47\r\n  XII   |       5–7, 1925      |  43      37\r\n  ------+----------------------+----------------\r\n\r\nTracks of other and older storms than those shown on this chart were\r\npublished in previous editions.

S. tracks, or 20 miles south of Sable Island\r\neastbound, when proceeding on Canadian tracks.\r\n\r\nVessels bound direct to Portland (Maine) may follow the Canadian\r\nSeasonal tracks.\r\n\r\nNOTE.—The above routes are liable to alterations when, owing to\r\nabnormal ice conditions it is considered advisable by the steamship\r\nlines who are parties to the North Atlantic Track Agreement. Notice of\r\nthese alterations will be published by the U. S. Hydrographic Office.\r\n\r\n\r\n=4.=                     U. S. STORM WARNINGS.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n  N. W. Winds\r\n  S. W.

Pennants 5 feet hoist, 12 feet fly.\r\n\r\n_Storm Warning Flags._—A red flag with a black center indicates that a\r\nstorm of marked violence is expected.\r\n\r\nThe pennants displayed with the flags indicate the direction of\r\nthe wind: Red, easterly; white, westerly. The pennant above the\r\nflag indicates that the wind is expected to blow from the northerly\r\nquadrants; below, from southerly quadrants.\r\n\r\nBy night the approach of storms of marked violence is indicated by:\r\nTwo red lights, one above the other, for winds beginning from the\r\nnortheast; a single red light for winds beginning from the southeast; a\r\nred light above a white light for winds beginning from the southwest;\r\nand a white light above a red light for winds beginning from the\r\nnorthwest.\r\n\r\n_Hurricane Warnings._—Two red flags with black centers, one above the\r\nother, displayed by day, or two red lights with a white light between,\r\ndisplayed by night, indicate the expected approach of a tropical\r\nhurricane, or one of the extremely severe and dangerous storms which\r\noccasionally move across the Lakes and northern Atlantic coast. These\r\nwarnings are displayed at 219 Weather Bureau stations on the Atlantic\r\nand Gulf coasts of the United States, and at the following places in\r\nthe West Indies: Basseterre, St. Kitts; Aguadilla Central, Aguirre\r\nCentral, Arecibo, Arroyo, Fajardo Playa, Guanica Central, Humacao\r\nPlaya, Luiza (Canovanas Central), Mayaguez Playa, Ponce, San Juan, and\r\nVieques Island, Porto Rico; Kingston, Jamaica; Puerto Plata, San Pedro\r\nde Macoris, and Santo Domingo, Haiti; Roseau, Dominica; St. Thomas,\r\nVirgin Islands of the U. S. A.; Grand Turk Island, Turks Islands; Swan\r\nIsland; and Habana, Cuba.\r\n\r\nNOTE.—The Weather Bureau stations at Cape Henry, Virginia, and the\r\nPhiladelphia Maritime Exchange Station at Delaware Breakwater are\r\nequipped for day and night communication with passing vessels. The\r\nInternational Code is used by day and the Morse Code, flashlight, by\r\nnight. Messages to or from vessels will be forwarded to destination.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SMALL CRAFT]\r\n\r\nModerately strong winds are expected\r\n\r\nA red pennant indicates that moderately strong winds that will\r\ninterfere with the safe operation of small craft are expected. No night\r\ndisplay of small-craft warnings is made.\r\n\r\n\r\n=5.=                 U. S. SUBMARINE WARNING FLAG\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe submarine distinguishing and warning flag is hoisted on the tender\r\nor parent ship of United States submarines to indicate that submarines\r\nare operating in that vicinity. It consists of a rectangular red flag\r\nwith white center on which is the profile of a torpedo in black.\r\nLaunches accompanying submarines also fly this flag.\r\n\r\nVessels seeing this signal should give the escorting vessel a wide\r\nberth and keep a good lookout for submarines.\r\n\r\n\r\n=6.=                     EXPLANATION OF SYMBOLS.\r\n\r\n[Illustration] =DERELICTS AND WRECKS.=—The name of the vessel is\r\ngiven, if known, and the symbol in red represents the reported rig and\r\ncondition at the date set opposite to the position. The successive\r\npositions in which the derelict was sighted are joined by lines of\r\ndashes and the corresponding dates are indicated.\r\n\r\n[Illustration] =DRIFTING BUOYS.=—These are shown in red color. The\r\ndate when sighted is also given in red.\r\n\r\nICEBERGS    FIELD ICE.—These symbols with date represent ice of\r\nprevious month. When numerous bergs are reported by one vessel along a\r\ngiven track the date and position of the first and last one only are\r\ngraphically shown, and the number of bergs is written on a line joining\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n[Illustration] =RADIO STATIONS.=—Represents various governmental\r\nstations. The U. S. naval radio stations operate to various distances.\r\nCommunication with most of them can be relied upon by all vessels for\r\n100 nautical miles at least.\r\n\r\n=MAGNETIC VARIATION.=—The lines of equal magnetic variation for every\r\ndegree for the epoch 1925 are shown by lines of fine dots in black.\r\n\r\n=OCEAN CURRENTS.=—The yearly average set of the stream and drift\r\ncurrents is shown by small black arrows.\r\n\r\n=STORM TRACKS.=—The several red lines indicate the individual paths\r\nfollowed by the centers of the more severe cyclonic storms that\r\nhave occurred during the corresponding month in past years. (See\r\ntable in another column.) The successive positions of a storm center\r\nat Greenwich mean noon are indicated by small circles with their\r\ncorresponding dates.\r\n\r\n[Illustration] =PREVAILING WINDS AND CALMS.=—The wind rose, in blue\r\ncolor, in each 5-degree square shows the character of the winds that\r\nhave prevailed within that square. The wind percentages north of\r\nlatitude 30° were concentrated upon eight points; south of latitude 30°\r\nupon sixteen points. The arrows fly with the wind. The length of the\r\narrow, measured from the center of the circle on the attached scale,\r\ngives the number of times in each 100 observations that the wind has\r\nblown from or near the given point. The number of feathers shows the\r\naverage force of the wind on the Beaufort scale. The figure in the\r\ncenter of the circle gives the percentage of calms, light airs, and\r\nvariable winds.\r\n\r\nFOR EXAMPLE: The attached wind rose should be read thus: In each 100\r\nhours the wind has averaged as follows: from N. 32 hours, force, 4;\r\nfrom NNE. 20 hours, force 3; from NW, 18 hours, force, 2; calms, light\r\nairs, and variables, 30 hours.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SCALE OF WIND PERCENTAGES]\r\n\r\n\r\n=7.=              NORTH ATLANTIC LANE ROUTES—CANADA\r\n\r\nIn accordance with the North Atlantic Track Agreement, the Hydrographic\r\nOffice advises that the North Atlantic Lane Routes to Canada shown in\r\nfull black lines are effective as follows:\r\n\r\n                               TRACK “F”\r\n\r\nFrom May 16 to the Opening of Belle Isle Route and to November 30 When\r\nNot Using the Belle Isle Route\r\n\r\n=Eastbound.=—Steer from a position 25 miles south of Cape Race on\r\na course 10 miles south of the Great Circle track until approaching\r\nFastnet, Inishtrahull, or 19 miles south of Bishop Rock.\r\n\r\n=Westbound.=—Steer from Fastnet, Inishtrahull, or 10 miles south of\r\nBishop Rock, on a course 10 miles north of the Great Circle track until\r\napproaching Cape Race, then steer a course to pass 10 miles south of\r\nCape Race, thence to the St. Lawrence.\r\n\r\n                               TRACK “G”\r\n\r\nFrom the Opening of the Strait of Belleisle to November 14\r\n\r\n=Eastbound.=—Steer from Belle Isle on a course 10 miles south of the\r\nGreat Circle track until approaching Fastnet, Inishtrahull, or 10 miles\r\nsouth of Bishop Rock.\r\n\r\n=Westbound.=—Steer from Fastnet, Inishtrahull, or 10 miles south of\r\nBishop Rock on a course 10 miles north of the Great Circle track until\r\napproaching Belle Isle.\r\n\r\nNOTE.—Vessels bound to or from U. S. Ports FROM OR TO THE NORTH OF\r\nIRELAND have the option of following the Canadian Seasonal Track “F”\r\npassing 40 miles south of Sable Island WESTBOUND, thence to position\r\nsouth of Nantucket, and EASTBOUND from position 40° 10′ N. in 70° 00′\r\nW. to position 60 miles south of Sable Island.\r\n\r\n\r\n=8.=                       TO ALL OBSERVERS\r\n\r\nMany letters to observers acknowledging reports of marine data are\r\nreturned to the Hydrographic Office on account of wrong or insufficient\r\naddress.\r\n\r\nIt is realized that mariners change their addresses frequently and\r\ntheir mail in consequence is frequently delayed and sometimes lost;\r\nbut the office is anxious to get letters of acknowledgment through to\r\neach observer, and to accomplish this it requests observers to indicate\r\nplainly in reports where acknowledgments should be sent.\r\n\r\nShould any observer fail to receive an acknowledgment of information\r\nfurnished this office, he may be sure that it is due to faulty address,\r\nas every report is acknowledged.\r\n\r\n\r\n=9.=                         LOCAL WEATHER\r\n\r\nFor extended remarks on wind and weather along the more important\r\ncoasts, see the Sailing Directions published by the U. S. Hydrographic\r\nOffice.\r\n\r\n\r\n=10.=            CURRENTS NORTHWARD OF BAHAMA ISLANDS\r\n\r\nIn the angle between the Gulf Stream and the Bahama or Antilles\r\nCurrent, and the Bahama Islands to approximately latitude 30° N.,\r\ncurrents setting southward have been experienced.\r\n\r\n\r\n=11.=                 U. S. COAST GUARD STATIONS\r\n\r\nAll U. S. Coast Guard Stations on the Atlantic and Pacific coasts are\r\nequipped for signaling by the International Code, the Semaphore Code,\r\nthe Occulting or Flashing-Light Code, and the International Morse Code\r\n(Wigwag). On the Atlantic coast those stations north of Cape Hatteras,\r\nwith few exceptions, and on the Pacific coast those stations near lines\r\nof communication, are prepared to transmit messages of passing vessels\r\neither by telegraph or by telephone and telegraph combined.\r\n\r\n\r\n=12.=                     NOTE TO OBSERVERS.\r\n\r\nHYDROGRAPHIC OFFICE PUBLICATIONS.—To those mariners who contribute\r\nmarine data relating to this or other publications of the Hydrographic\r\nOffice, the Pilot Charts, Notice to Mariners, and Hydrographic\r\nBulletins are given in exchange free of cost. In American ports in\r\nwhich a Branch Hydrographic Office is established mariners of every\r\nnationality should call for them in person and receive in addition the\r\nlatest information regarding charts, sailing directions, dangers to\r\nnavigation, etc. All services free. Office hours 9 a.m. to 4.30 p.m.\r\nTo other American ports and to foreign ports the Pilot Charts will be\r\nforwarded by mail upon application to the Hydrographic Office or to the\r\nnearest Branch Hydrographic Office. In such cases state clearly for\r\nwhich ocean and for which months they are desired and the post-office\r\naddress to which they should be sent.\r\n\r\nOTHER PLACES OF SUPPLY.—The above-named publications and observers’\r\nblanks will also be furnished upon application to the Harbor-master at\r\nManila and the American Consular Offices in the leading seaports abroad.\r\n\r\nMARINE DATA REPORTS.—These should be handed or mailed promptly upon\r\narrival in port to the nearest Branch Hydrographic Office, or to\r\nthe Main Office, in the franked envelope supplied for that purpose.\r\nAt places outside of the United States or its possessions such\r\ncommunications may be handed to the American Consul who will mail them\r\nfree of cost.\r\n\r\nOBSERVER’S ADDRESS.—Mail for captains and officers of the merchant\r\nmarine is frequently returned because the ship has sailed from the port\r\nnamed in the address. Those who desire their Pilot Charts, Notices to\r\nMariners, and Hydrographic Bulletins to reach them regularly should\r\nmake arrangements to have their mail follow them, or else give the\r\nHydrographic Office an address at which such mail will be held for them\r\nuntil they return.\r\n\r\n\r\n=13.=            LAG IN U.S. NAVAL RADIO TIME SIGNALS\r\n\r\nThe U. S. Naval observatory during the year 1925, determined the lag\r\nof the Annapolis and Arlington signals to be about nine hundredths of\r\na second (.09). The error of the time signal is generally less than\r\none-tenth of a second (.1).\r\n\r\n\r\n=14.=                            FOG.\r\n\r\nThe dotted blue lines show the percentage of days on which fog was\r\nobserved in November from 1901 to 1906, inclusive.\r\n\r\n\r\n=15.= HYDROGRAPHIC OFFICE PUBLICATIONS OBTAINABLE AT THE PANAMA CANAL\r\n\r\nBy authority of The Governor of The Panama Canal some of the duties of\r\nthe Branch Hydrographic Offices are performed by the Captain of the\r\nPort at Cristobal and the Captain of the Port at Balboa. Reference\r\ncharts and sailing directions may be consulted at these offices, and\r\nshipmasters may receive the Pilot Charts, Notice to Mariners, and\r\nHydrographic Bulletin in return for marine and meteorological data\r\nreports. Observers’ blanks and comparisons of navigational instruments\r\nmay be obtained at the same time. Neither of these offices maintains\r\na regular mailing list for the distribution of publications; such\r\nmailing lists are maintained at the Branch Hydrographic Offices along\r\nthe United States coasts (see addresses elsewhere on the chart) and at\r\nthe main office, Washington, for the benefit of those shipmasters and\r\nofficers who contribute data regularly.\r\n\r\nSALE OF HYDROGRAPHIC OFFICE PUBLICATIONS.—The Captain of the Port of\r\nCristobal, Canal Zone, is an agent for the sale of Hydrographic Office\r\npublications.
