The attention recently drawn to the subject has\r\nresulted in many inquiries for information useful to the planter\r\ndesirous of starting a tobacco estate. But beyond scattered articles in\r\nnewspapers and the proceedings of agricultural societies, there has been\r\nno practical literature available for the English reader. It is a little\r\nremarkable that while our neighbours have been writing extensively about\r\ntobacco growing, of late years, no English book devoted exclusively to\r\nthis subject has been published for nearly thirty years. A glance at the\r\nbibliography given at the end of this volume will show that the French,\r\nGerman, Swiss, Italian, Dutch, Sicilian, and even Scandinavian planter\r\nhas a reliable handbook to guide him in this important branch of\r\nagriculture, while British settlers in our numerous tobacco-growing\r\ncolonies must glean their information as best they may from periodical\r\nliterature.\r\n\r\nTo supply the want thus indicated, the present volume has been prepared.\r\nThe invaluable assistance of tobacco-planters in both the Indies and in\r\nmany other tropical countries, has rendered the portion relating to\r\nfield operations eminently practical and complete, while the editor’s\r\nacquaintance with agricultural chemistry and familiarity with the best\r\ntobacco-growing regions of Asiatic Turkey, have enabled him to exercise\r\na general supervision over the statements of the various contributors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CONTENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER I.\r\n                                                                    PAGE\r\n THE PLANT                                                             1\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER II.\r\n\r\n CULTIVATION                                                           7\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER III.\r\n\r\n CURING                                                               67\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\n PRODUCTION AND COMMERCE                                             137\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER V.\r\n\r\n PREPARATION AND USE                                                 231\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\n NATURE AND PROPERTIES                                               253\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\n ADULTERATIONS AND SUBSTITUTES                                       267\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\n IMPORTS, DUTIES, VALUES, AND CONSUMPTION                            271\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\n BIBLIOGRAPHY                                                        276\r\n\r\n INDEX                                                               281\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                         LIST OF ILLUSTRATIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\n FIG.

In what country or at what\r\ndate its use originated has little to do with us from a practical point\r\nof view, though interesting enough as a subject for the student of\r\nethnography and natural history. Suffice it to say that it has been\r\ngrown and smoked since pre-historic times in many tropical and\r\nsub-tropical countries, and has assumed an importance in modern daily\r\nlife only surpassed by a few prominent food plants and cotton.\r\n\r\nThis long-continued and widespread cultivation has helped to produce\r\nlocal varieties or races of the plant which have sometimes been mistaken\r\nfor distinct species, and caused a multiplication of scientific names\r\nalmost bewildering. The following epitome comprehends the species and\r\nvarieties of _Nicotiana_ possessing interest for the cultivator:—\r\n\r\nI. _N. Tabacum macrophylla_ [_latifolia_, _lattissima_,\r\n_gigantea_]—Maryland tobacco. Of this, there are two sub-species—(1)\r\nStalkless Maryland, of the following varieties: (_a_) _N. macrophylla\r\novata_—short-leaved Maryland, producing a good smoking-tobacco, (_b_)\r\n_N. macrophylla longifolia_—long-leaved Maryland, yielding a good\r\nsmoking-tobacco, and excellent wrappers for cigars, (_c_) _N.\r\nmacrophylla pandurata_—broad-leaved, or Amersfort, much cultivated in\r\nGermany and Holland, a heavy cropper, and especially adapted for the\r\nmanufacture of good snuff; (2) Stalked Maryland, of the following\r\nvarieties: (_a_) _N. macrophylla alata_, (_b_) _N. macrophylla\r\ncordata_—heart-shaped Maryland, producing a very fine leaf, from which\r\nprobably the finest Turkish is obtained. Cuban and Manilla are now\r\nattributed to this group.\r\n\r\nII. _N. Tabacum angustifolia_—Virginian tobacco. Of this, there are two\r\nsub-species—(1) Stalkless Virginian of the following varieties: (_a_)\r\n_N. angustifolia acuminata_, grown in Germany for snuff, seldom for\r\nsmoking, (_b_) _N. angustifolia lanceolata_, affords snuff, (_c_) _N.\r\nangustifolia pendulifolia_, another snuff tobacco, (_d_) _N.\r\nangustifolia latifolia_—broad-leaved Virginian, used chiefly for snuff,\r\n(_e_) _N. angustifolia undulata_—wave-like Virginian, matures quickly,\r\n(_f_) _N. angustifolia pandurata_, furnishes good leaves for smoking,\r\nproduces heavily, and is much grown in Germany, and said to be grown at\r\nthe Pruth as “tempyki,” and highly esteemed there; (2) Stalked\r\nVirginian, of the following varieties: (_a_) _N. angustifolia alata_,\r\n(_b_) _N. angustifolia lanceolata_ [_N. fructiosa_], growing to a height\r\nof 8 ft., (_c_) _N. angustifolia oblonga_, (_d_) _N. angustifolia\r\ncordata_—E. Indian, producing heavily in good soil, and well adapted for\r\nsnuff, but not for smoking. Latakia and Turkish are now accredited to\r\n_N. Tabacum_.\r\n\r\nIII. _N. rustica._—Common, Hungarian, or Turkish tobacco. Of this, there\r\nare two varieties: (_a_) _N. rustica cordata_—large-leaved Hungarian,\r\nBrazilian, Turkish, Asiatic, furnishing leaves for smoking; (_b_) _N.\r\nrustica ovata_—small-leaved Hungarian, affords fine aromatic leaves for\r\nsmoking, but the yield is small. Until quite recently, Latakia, Turkish,\r\nand Manilla tobaccos were referred to this species; Latakia is now\r\nproved to belong to _N. Tabacum_, and Manilla is said to be absolutely\r\nidentical with Cuban, which latter is now ascribed to _N. Tabacum\r\nmacrophylla_.\r\n\r\nIV. _N. crispa._—This species is much grown in Syria, Calabria, and\r\nCentral Asia, and furnishes leaves for the celebrated cigars of the\r\nLevant.\r\n\r\nV. _N. persica._—Hitherto supposed to be a distinct species, affording\r\nthe Shiraz tobacco, but now proved to be only a form of _N. Tabacum_.\r\n\r\nVI. _N. repanda._—A Mexican plant, with small foliage. Long thought to\r\nbe a distinct species peculiar to Cuba, but none such is now to be found\r\nin Cuba, whether wild or cultivated, and all the Cuban tobacco is now\r\nobtained from _N. Tabacum macrophyllum_.\r\n\r\nAmong the many other forms interesting only to the botanist or\r\nhorticulturist, the principal are _N. paniculata_, _N. glutinosa_, _N.\r\nglauca_, attaining a height of 18 ft., and _N. clevelandii_, exceedingly\r\nstrong, quite recently discovered in California, and supposed to have\r\nbeen used by the early natives of that country.\r\n\r\nThus the bulk of the best tobaccos of the world is afforded by the old\r\nwell-known species _Nicotiana Tabacum_.\r\n\r\nA good idea of the foliage and inflorescence of commonly cultivated\r\ntobaccos may be gained from a study of the accompanying illustrations.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1.]\r\n\r\nFig. 1 is a Cuban tobacco, and much grown on the continent of Europe,\r\nnotably in Holland, Germany, and Switzerland, and there known as\r\n_goundie_, from the name of an American consul who introduced the plant\r\ninto Germany in 1848. It has a broad yet somewhat pointed leaf, with the\r\nribs not arranged in pairs; it is fine, soft, thin, and esteemed for\r\nsmoking in pipes and for wrappers of cigars.\r\n\r\nOne variety of the Maryland plant is shown in Fig. 2. The leaves spring\r\nfrom a tall stem at considerable intervals, and are broad and rounded at\r\nthe end. This kind is valued for cigar-wrappers, and assumes a fine\r\nlight brown colour when well cured.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 2.]\r\n\r\nA broad-leaved Cuban or Maryland growth long naturalized in Germany, and\r\nnow familiar as Amersfort, is represented in Fig. 3. It is distinguished\r\nby unusual length of leaf accompanied by a corresponding narrowness. A\r\nstem and flower are shown at _a_, a leaf at _b_, a flower in section at\r\n_c_, a capsule at _d_, a seed at _e_, and a cross-section of a leaflet\r\nat _f_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 3.]\r\n\r\nThese three examples represent the most successful kinds grown in Europe\r\nand at the same time some of the most marked diversities of form of\r\nleaf.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER II.\r\n                              CULTIVATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following observations on the methods of cultivating tobacco have\r\nreference more particularly to the processes as conducted in Cuba,\r\nIndia, and the United States; this branch of agriculture has been\r\nbrought to great perfection in the last-named country, and the\r\nsupervision of the operations in India is mostly entrusted to skilled\r\nAmericans.\r\n\r\n_Climate._—Of the many conditions affecting the quality of tobacco, the\r\nmost important is climate. The other conditions that must be fulfilled\r\nin order to succeed in the cultivation of this crop may be modified, or\r\neven sometimes created, to suit the purpose; but cultivators can do\r\nlittle with reference to climate: the utmost they can do is to change\r\nthe cultivating season, and this only in places where tobacco can be\r\ngrown nearly throughout the year. The aromatic principles, on the\r\npresence of which the value of a tobacco chiefly depends, can only be\r\nproperly developed in the plant by the agency of high temperature and\r\nmoisture. The fame that Cuban and Manilla tobaccos enjoy is mostly due\r\nto the climate. The article produced in Cuba is most highly esteemed; up\r\nto this time, no other country has been able to compete successfully\r\nwith it. However it cannot be doubted that there are many places whose\r\nclimate justifies the assumption that a tobacco could be grown there,\r\nnot inferior to that produced in the West Indies. The more closely the\r\nclimate of a place corresponds with that of Cuba, the greater chance is\r\nthere that a Havana a variety will preserve its peculiar aroma. In such\r\nplaces, a fine and valuable tobacco may be grown with less expenditure\r\non labour, &c., than it is necessary to bestow in raising an inferior\r\narticle in less suitable climes. In countries where a low temperature\r\nrules, the plants must be raised in hot-beds, and there is also a great\r\nrisk that the young plants may be destroyed by frost, or afterwards by\r\nhailstones. When damp weather prevails during the tobacco harvest, it is\r\noften injured; and to give the required flavour, &c., to make the\r\narticle marketable, macerating has often to be resorted to, thus\r\ninvolving great risk and expenditure. But in spite of these drawbacks,\r\ntobacco cultivation is often very remuneratively carried out in\r\ncountries possessing an unfavourable climate. The deficient climatic\r\nconditions are here partly compensated for by making the other\r\nconditions affecting the quality of tobacco, and which can be controlled\r\nby the cultivator, the most favourable possible.\r\n\r\n_Soil._—The soil affects to a great extent the quality of a tobacco. The\r\nplant thrives best in a soil rich in vegetable mould; this, however, is\r\nnot so much required to supply the necessary plant food, as to keep the\r\nsoil in a good physical condition. No other plant requires the soil in\r\nsuch a friable state. A light soil, sand or sandy loam, containing an\r\naverage amount of organic matter, and well drained, is considered best\r\nadapted for raising smoking-tobacco; such a soil produces the finest\r\nleaves. The more organic matter a soil contains, the heavier is the\r\noutturn; but the leaves grow thicker, and the aroma becomes less. As, in\r\ntropical climates, the physical properties of the soil play a prominent\r\npart in its productive capabilities generally, and the presence of\r\norganic matter in the soil tends to improve these properties, it will\r\nrarely occur that in such places a soil will contain too much humus. The\r\nmore clay in a soil, the less is it adapted to the production of fine\r\nsmoking-tobacco, on account of its physical properties being less\r\nfavourable to the development of the aromatic principles; the leaf\r\nbecomes also generally thick and coarse, but the outturn on such soils\r\nis commonly heavier than on a more sandy one. A clay soil possessing a\r\ngreat amount of humus may, if properly tilled, produce an ordinary\r\nsmoking-tobacco, and may even, if great attention be paid to the\r\nselection of the variety, &c., produce leaves for cigar-wrappers.\r\n\r\nOf less importance than the physical properties of the soil is its\r\nchemical composition. By proper tillage and heavy manuring, tobacco is\r\nsometimes grown on comparatively poor soils. From analysis of the plant,\r\nit is clear that it contains a large amount of ash constituents, which\r\nit extracts from the soil; the most important of these are potash and\r\nlime. A soil destitute of these constituents would require a great\r\nquantity of manure to supply the wants of tobacco.\r\n\r\nAn experienced Ohio planter, Judson Popenoe, speaking of soil, says “A\r\nrich, sandy, second bottom, I believe to be the best for raising\r\ntobacco, although our chocolate-coloured uplands, when very rich and\r\nhighly manured, will grow an excellent quality of tobacco, but will not\r\nyield as much to the acre. Black river-bottoms will yield more to the\r\nacre than any other kind of land, but the tobacco is not of so fine a\r\nquality; it grows larger, has coarser stems, and heavier body, and\r\nconsequently, in my opinion, is not so good for wrappers or fine cut as\r\nthe second bottom or upland tobacco.”\r\n\r\nOn the same subject, an Illinois grower observes, “for us in the West,\r\nand for all the localities that have not an over-amount of heat,\r\nexperience has proved, that a dry, warm soil (loam or sandy loam), rich,\r\ndeep, and containing lime, is most suitable for tobacco. The more sandy,\r\nto a certain degree, the soil is, the better will be the quality of the\r\ntobacco; the nearer the soil is to clay, the poorer will be the crop\r\nunder similar circumstances, although the yield may yet be satisfactory.\r\nClayey soil will hardly produce tobacco suitable for cigars. Wet and\r\ntough clay soils are under no circumstances suitable to tobacco.”\r\n\r\n_Situation._—Land intended for tobacco-culture should have good\r\ndrainage, and be sheltered from high winds. In Holland, where\r\ntobacco-cultivation is carried out to great perfection, each field is\r\nsurrounded by a hedge about 7 ft. high; the fields are divided into\r\nsmall plots, which are again bordered by rows of plants that are able to\r\nbreak the force of the wind, which would injure the leaves, and render\r\nthem of comparatively little value. To this circumstance must chiefly be\r\nattributed the fact that Dutch growers succeed in getting as much as 50\r\nper cent. of leaves of the first quality, whereas in most other\r\ncountries 25 per cent. is considered to be a very good outturn.\r\n\r\nIn the United States, several rows of pole beans, i. e. scarlet runners,\r\na few steps apart, are sometimes planted as a wind-screen.\r\n\r\n_Manure._—In its natural state, the soil will rarely possess the\r\nelements of plant food in such a form as is most conducive to the\r\nproduction of a fine tobacco-leaf. Any deficiency must be supplied in\r\nthe shape of suitable manure. Schlösing found that a bad burning tobacco\r\nwas produced on a soil containing little potash, on unmanured soil, on\r\nsoil manured with flesh, humus, calcium chloride, magnesium chloride,\r\nand potassium chloride. A good burning tobacco was produced on a soil\r\nmanured with potassium carbonate, saltpetre, and potassium sulphate.\r\nMore recent experiments carried out by other investigators tend to\r\ncorroborate these conclusions. It is generally assumed that a soil rich\r\nin nitrogenous organic matter produces a strong tobacco that burns\r\nbadly.\r\n\r\nThe results of Nessler’s experiments clearly show that it is not\r\nsufficient to apply the element most needed by the plant—potash—in any\r\nform, but that, to produce a good tobacco, it is necessary to apply it\r\nin a particular combination. It was found that potash carbonate applied\r\nas manure produced the best tobacco: it burned for the longest time, and\r\nits ash contained most potash carbonate; whereas potash chloride\r\nproduced a much inferior tobacco. The assertion of other experimenters\r\nthat chlorides produce a bad tobacco is thus confirmed. Potash sulphate\r\nand lime sulphate produced a good tobacco. It may be noticed here that\r\ntobacco which was manured with gypsum contained a great amount of potash\r\ncarbonate in the ash, probably due to the fact that gypsum is a solvent\r\nfor the inert potash salts. From the foregoing, it may be concluded that\r\nin tobacco cultivation, the elements potassium and calcium should be\r\nrestored to the soil in the form of carbonate, sulphate, or nitrate, but\r\nnot as chlorides. Poudrette, or prepared night-soil, generally contains\r\na considerable amount of chlorides, and is not well suited as manure for\r\nfine tobacco. It has been found that fields manured with chlorides\r\nproduced heavily; a small proportion of chlorides may therefore be\r\napplied in this form, whenever quality is of less importance than\r\nquantity. Farmyard manure may suffice when tobacco is cultivated in\r\nproper rotation, but here also, unless the soil be very rich in\r\npotassium and calcium, the application of some special manure will\r\ngreatly enhance the value of the outturn. Wood-ashes are a valuable\r\nsupplement to stable dung. Gypsum is an excellent dressing for soils in\r\na good manurial condition: it supplies the lime needed by the tobacco,\r\nand acts as a solvent on the inert potash salts. Gypsum applied on poor\r\nland, however, hastens the exhaustion of the soil. It is said that crops\r\nmanured with gypsum suffer less from the effects of drought, and require\r\nless irrigation, than when manured otherwise: the leaves of plants that\r\nhad been manured with gypsum exhaling less water than when manured with\r\nother substances. If this assertion be correct, gypsum would be\r\ninvaluable to the Indian cultivator.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the amount of manure to be employed, it may be observed\r\nthat, with farmyard manure properly rotted, there is no theoretical\r\nlimit, especially when the tobacco is intended for snuff, and is grown\r\nin a hot climate, where the physical properties of the soil are of the\r\nutmost importance. It is said that some Rhenish-Bavarian soils contain\r\nas much as 15 per cent. of organic matter, yet the cultivator considers\r\nit necessary to heavily manure each tobacco crop. Dutch growers apply to\r\nthe rich alluvial soil as much as 25 tons an acre of well-rotted\r\ncattle-manure. In America, it is reported that the heaviest crops are\r\nobtained on soil newly taken up, and very rich in vegetable mould. It is\r\nconsidered nearly everywhere that tobacco will pay best when heavily\r\nmanured. The first care of even the poorest peasant in the tobacco\r\ndistricts of Germany, Holland, &c., as soon as he sells his tobacco, is\r\nto purchase the manure which he considers essential to his success.\r\n\r\nThe amount of any special manure which can be applied without injury to\r\nthe plants depends very much on the solubility of the stuff, and the\r\nmanner of applying it. Highly soluble salts, such as soda or potash\r\nnitrate, should be applied in smaller quantities than salts which\r\ndissolve slowly. With regard to the manner of applying concentrated\r\nmanures, it is evident that, when a salt is applied in close proximity\r\nto the plant, less will be required than when strewn over the whole\r\nfield. When applied in solution, not more than 300 lb. of nitrate per\r\nacre should be used at one time. The amount to be applied varies also\r\nwith the soil; a sandy soil, which has little absorptive power, should\r\nreceive less than a clay. Salts easily disintegrating should not be\r\napplied before tobacco has been planted, especially not before heavy\r\nrains which would carry off the salt. To supply the potash required by\r\nthe tobacco plant, 200 lb. of good saltpetre per acre would be\r\nsufficient in most cases. Lime, although removed from the soil in large\r\nquantities, is rarely applied to tobacco as a special manure. Where\r\nwood-ashes can be had at a moderate price, lime may be applied in this\r\nform. Some ashes are very rich in lime. It has been found that ashes\r\nobtained from beech-wood contain 52 per cent. of lime, and those from\r\noak-wood as much as 75.\r\n\r\nWhilst most growers are agreed that tobacco is a crop demanding a rich\r\nsoil, there is a want of uniformity of opinion as to the best method of\r\nmanuring. On this point, C. Schneider, a successful Illinois planter,\r\nsays “manuring cannot be done too early, or too heavily. The manures are\r\nvery different, and equally useful for the different kinds of tobacco.\r\nWe may classify them as follows:—\r\n\r\n“To be applied shortly before planting, and in equal quantities, for all\r\nkinds of tobacco: 1. Guano, 200 to 300 pounds on the acre; 2.\r\nPoultry-droppings, 400 to 500 pounds; 3. Green manure in any quantity;\r\n4. Sheep-dung, 6 two-horse loads; 5. Cattle manure, 10 two-horse loads.\r\n\r\n“For chewing-tobacco and snuff: 1. Sheep-dung, 10 to 12 loads per acre;\r\n2. Cattle manure, 20 to 30 loads; 3. Horse-dung, 15 to 25 loads; 4. Hog\r\nmanure, 20 to 30 loads. The last two are useless for smoking-tobacco, or\r\nfor that to be used for cigars.\r\n\r\n“The first three manures (guano, poultry-droppings, and green manure)\r\nmust be followed after the tobacco-crop, by a plentiful supply of\r\nstable-manure. The tobacco-stalks themselves, rotted or burned to ashes,\r\nsown over the field before the transplanting, or in the\r\nplanting-furrows, will act as a good manure, but are not sufficient. In\r\nhighly-worked farms, that is, where the soil is valuable, and cannot\r\nremain idle, it will pay every way, to sow rye for fodder on the\r\ntobacco-land in the fall; this may be made into hay, or turned under as\r\nmanure at the beginning of July, just as may seem most profitable. Deep\r\nploughing for the rye, and afterward for the tobacco, must not be\r\nforgotten.”\r\n\r\nR. E. Burton, in the _Sugar Cane_, translating from Mitjen’s essay on\r\ntobacco growing in the most renowned district of Cuba, has the following\r\nsensible remarks on the all-important subject of manuring:—\r\n\r\n“Each veguero or farmer should make a hole or rotting-bin in which he\r\nshould deposit as much muck and leaves as he may be able to accumulate,\r\nand, before giving the last ploughing to prepare his field for planting\r\nthe tobacco, he should spread over it all the prepared rotten manure he\r\ncan procure. Manure that is not thoroughly rotten injures the plants\r\nmore than benefits them. A piece of land, well manured and thoroughly\r\nworked up, will produce four times more tobacco than one badly prepared\r\nwould. Consequently no expense or labour is so remunerative as that\r\nwhich is applied to the soil. This is a very important point which\r\nshould fix the attention of every agriculturist who desires to prosper.\r\n\r\n“Agriculturists acknowledge the advantage of manuring. In tobacco\r\ncultivation it produces the most brilliant results, but in Vuelta-Abajo\r\nit is very difficult to procure sufficient country manure. Yagues (i.e.\r\nstrips of palm bark used as screens, and for baling) and all the refuse\r\nfrom palm trees are excellent; grass from the savannahs and all kinds of\r\nvegetables in a thoroughly putrid state are very good, but it requires a\r\ngreat quantity, and the immense labour to collect and prepare these,\r\nfrightens the greater number of vegueros, and few have sufficient\r\nconstancy to enable them to collect enough properly prepared manure for\r\ntheir fields.\r\n\r\n“The most which some manage to do is to spread refuse over some portions\r\nof land, where it rots and fertilizes the soil; but this system is\r\ninefficacious, because the vegetable substances being very light, the\r\nheavy rains wash away the greater portion of the decomposed matter, and\r\nfully nine-tenths are lost. If the system was adopted of depositing this\r\nmanure in holes or trenches, from which it can be removed when\r\nthoroughly rotted and fit for the fields, it would produce much more\r\nwith much less labour; for although at first sight the labour appears to\r\nbe doubled, by having to carry it twice, it must be remembered that one\r\nload of well-prepared manure is better than ten or twenty of grass or\r\nbush that is not rotten.\r\n\r\n“But in every way there is great difficulty in collecting vegetable\r\nmanure in sufficient quantities; recently, guano has been tried with the\r\nmost brilliant success.\r\n\r\n“Peruvian guano is the most compact fertilizer known, and a very small\r\nquantity suffices to manure a tobacco field; its cost is not excessive,\r\nand is very frequently less than the carriage of other manures to the\r\nspot where they are to be used. Its most active results are shown on\r\nlight and sandy soil; it quickens vegetation, and experience has shown\r\nthat it increases prodigiously the quantity and value of crops; we\r\ntherefore recommend the use of guano as a fertilizer of the first order\r\nfor tobacco cultivation, and as light and sandy soils possess in\r\nthemselves the substances most suitable for the development of the\r\ntobacco plant, on such soils guano acts as a stimulant to the plant.\r\n\r\n“Before using Peruvian guano, it should be sifted; all the stones and\r\nlumps remaining should be broken up, and again sifted, so that nothing\r\nmay be lost. After this, three or four times its weight of dry sandy\r\nsoil should be thoroughly mixed with it, and it should remain thus 6–8\r\ndays before being used. This preparation should be made under cover, to\r\navoid the possibility of rain falling on the mixture, and the heap\r\nshould be covered with the empty guano bags, or anything else, to\r\nprevent the evaporation of the volatile alkali which it contains.\r\n\r\n“It is better to prepare this mixture in detail, each heap containing\r\none bag of guano, whose weight is 150–160 lb., so as to facilitate the\r\ncalculation of the quantity that should be applied, and prevent\r\nmistakes. We will start, therefore, on this calculation.\r\n\r\n“On lands of good quality, but which, nevertheless, require manure, from\r\nhaving been overworked, one pound of guano should be applied to each\r\n15–20 superficial yards, or, say one heap of compost for each 2500–3000\r\nyards, or, otherwise said, one heap of manure will suffice for a surface\r\nthat contains 5000–6000 plants.\r\n\r\n“In sandy unproductive soil, and on sterile savannah lands, 1 lb. of\r\nguano to 9–12 yards; or a heap of compost guano to 1500–2000 yards; or\r\none heap for 3000–4000 plants.\r\n\r\n“These are the proportions to be used for the first year; for the\r\nsecond, and forward, two-thirds of that employed the first year will be\r\nsufficient.\r\n\r\n“When crops of tobacco and corn are grown on the same lands, half the\r\nguano should be applied to the corn and the other half to the tobacco;\r\nbut then a somewhat larger quantity will be required. The manure should\r\nbe applied shortly before transplanting, and after the ground has been\r\nwell cross-ploughed and prepared, and the ground should be plotted out\r\ninto squares or beds of 50 yards square. The manure should then be\r\nspread and ploughed in, and the land should at once be furrowed and\r\nplanted.\r\n\r\n“Under this system of applying Peruvian guano as manure for tobacco the\r\nbest results have been obtained, and, of all the various trials made,\r\nthis is the most simple and the easiest to execute.”\r\n\r\nThe remarks of the last-quoted essayist are good so long as guano is to\r\nbe had. But there is a limit to the supply, and in many places it would\r\nbe unprocurable.\r\n\r\nThe necessity for more definite knowledge concerning the actual wants of\r\nthe tobacco plant in the matter of food, led to an investigation of the\r\nsubject some years ago by Prof. S. W. Johnson on behalf of the\r\nConnecticut State Board of Agriculture, and more recently by Schiffmayer\r\nfor the Agricultural Department of the Madras Presidency.\r\n\r\nProf. Johnson aptly observes it to be “a well-established fact that\r\nplants may receive from the soil and retain a larger portion of\r\nash-ingredients than is needful for nutrition. This is especially marked\r\nin case of the lime, potash, and soda salts. The excess of these\r\nsubstances thus taken up may either be deposited in the solid state in\r\nthe cells of the plant, or may remain dissolved in the juices. In\r\ntobacco, a part of the nitrogen usually exists as a nitrate, in\r\ncombination with potash. That is to say, portions of the nitrogenous\r\nfood of the plant—the nitrates of the soil—are not completely worked\r\nover into albuminoids, and into nicotine, the nitrogenous constituents\r\nof tobacco, but accumulate and remain in considerable quantity in the\r\nsap. When a dry tobacco-leaf is set on fire, it often burns like ‘touch\r\npaper’ (paper soaked in a solution of saltpetre and dried) with bright\r\nsparkles of fire, indicating the points where the nitre has gathered in\r\nminute crystals as the juice of the leaf evaporated. The quantity of\r\nsuperfluous salts in the plant depends upon its succulence, and upon the\r\nsupply of them in the soil. Doubtless certain definite amounts of\r\npotash, lime, magnesia, iron, sulphuric acid and phosphoric acid are\r\nabsolutely necessary to produce a given weight of tobacco. In case\r\nseveral or all these substances are superabundant in the soil, the plant\r\nhas no power to exclude any unnecessary surplus of one or all of them\r\nfrom its interior altogether, although there are good reasons known to\r\nprevent their entrance beyond a certain limit. In one soil potash may be\r\nrelatively most abundant, and may for that reason be found in the crop\r\nin greater quantity than was necessary for the growth of that crop. In\r\nanother soil lime may be in surplus, and there the crop may have the\r\nminimum of potash, and a considerable excess of lime.\r\n\r\n“The crop is a result of the working together of a number of causes or\r\nconditions; these are the heat and light of the sun, carbonic acid and\r\noxygen of the atmosphere, water, nitrates and ammonia, and the\r\nash-elements enumerated in our table of analyses. The crop is limited in\r\nquantity by that condition of growth, which is presented to it most\r\nsparingly. The richest and best prepared soil without solar warmth, or\r\nwithout due supplies of rain, cannot give a crop, and if weather be most\r\nfavourable, then in one field it may be too little potash, in another\r\ntoo little phosphoric acid, in another too little nitrogen, which lowers\r\nthe yield, or reduces the quality of the product.\r\n\r\n“It is usual in tobacco culture to manure very heavily, and in many\r\ncases it is probable that all the various forms of plant food are\r\npresent in available abundance. But soils differ in the nature of the\r\nsupplies which they are able to yield to crops, and fertilizers even,\r\nwhen the same in name, may be very unlike in fact. The chief reliance of\r\nthe tobacco farmer is stable manure. This, however, is by no means\r\nuniform in origin, appearance, evident quality, or chemical composition.\r\nThe manure from bullocks, wintered on hay and roots, is very different\r\nfrom that of horses maintained chiefly on oats or corn. The yard manure\r\nthat contains much strawy litter or much wasted hay, differs again from\r\nthat of the city stables, from which the straw is carefully raked out to\r\nbe used over and over again for bedding. The farm-made manure is likely\r\nto be much richer in potash and lime, and the city manure is richer in\r\nphosphates and nitrogen. Yet in the reports of the farmer, these two\r\nessentially different fertilizers are designated as stable manure\r\nsimply.\r\n\r\n“Every one understands that a fertilizer acts upon the plant to supply\r\nit with food, and to favour its growth; everybody is also convinced that\r\nsome fertilizers act upon the soil, improving its texture and\r\ncomposition and increasing its fertility. It is an equally well\r\nascertained fact that the soil acts upon fertilizers to modify their\r\neffect. A very wet or very dry soil is known to nullify the benefit\r\nwhich might be expected of a fertilizer in a simply moist soil; but more\r\nthan this, more than by the accident of external circumstances, it is a\r\nfact that each kind of soil has a special action of its own on\r\nfertilizers, so that if it were asserted of two soils, which, unmanured,\r\nwere of equal fertility, that a given fertilizer applied to both,\r\ngreatly improved the crop on one, and had little effect on the other,\r\nsuch a statement might not only be accepted as a fact, but an\r\nexplanation might be given in general terms for such a fact.\r\n\r\n“Now experiments have shown that different soils when mixed with like\r\nquantities of various fertilizing elements and then treated with water,\r\nin imitation of rain, manifest very different behaviour toward the\r\nadmixed substances. One soil will lay hold of the potash in a\r\nfertilizer, and fix it in a kind of chemical combination so firmly that\r\nwater can dissolve it but with extreme slowness; another soil puts its\r\ngrasp on the lime of a fertilizer, and at the same time allows potash\r\nwhich belongs to itself to be dissolved out freely. There is, in fact,\r\nalways a complicated series of changes set in operation whenever any\r\nfertilizer is incorporated with the soil, be it animal, vegetable, or\r\nmineral; be it alkali, acid, or saline; be it made on the farm or\r\nimported from abroad; be it natural or artificial. The fertilizer acts\r\non the soil, and the soil reacts on the fertilizer; but the point we\r\nwish to make prominent is this, that different soils are differently\r\naffected by one and the same application, or in other words, a given\r\nmanure fertilizes a given crop unequally in degree, and unlike in kind,\r\non different soils, by virtue of the different assimilating or fixing\r\npower, which the soil exerts upon its ingredients.\r\n\r\n“We know of the existence of these peculiarities of soils, and something\r\nof their causes and of the laws by which they act; but the real\r\nnecessities of the tobacco crop, or of any other crop, as respects\r\nsoil-ingredients, cannot be arrived at by chemical analysis of a single\r\nsample, nor of a dozen samples.” Thus analyses of a dozen New England\r\ntobaccos showed the following highest and lowest percentages of each\r\nash-ingredient, and of nitrogen:—\r\n\r\n  Silica            0·05 to    0·30│Magnesia          0·94  ”    2·21\r\n  Chlorine          0·08  ”    2·55│Potash            3·90  ”    7·45\r\n  Sulphuric acid    0·52  ”    1·69│Soda              0·08  ”    1·81\r\n  Phosphoric acid   0·47  ”    0·80│Nitrogen          3·20  ”    5·11\r\n  Lime              3·17  ”    8·22│\r\n\r\n“It appears that the percentages of nitrogen, phosphoric acid and potash\r\nare nearly twice as great in some samples as in others; that the\r\nproportions of magnesia and lime are about 2½ times greater in some\r\nsamples than in others, and that sulphuric acid is 3 times more in one\r\ncase than in another. The variation of silica is still greater, and the\r\ndisparity rises to its extreme in case of soda and chlorine, whose\r\nmaxima are respectively 20 and 30 times greater than their minima.”\r\n\r\nThe three ingredients chlorine, silica, and soda cannot be considered in\r\nthe light of essentials to tobacco culture; but the other substances are\r\nabsolutely indispensable to plant growth, and the absence of any one of\r\nthese would render a soil incapable of sustaining agricultural\r\nvegetation of any kind. “The variation in the percentage of these\r\ningredients depends somewhat upon the fact that the leaves of different\r\ncrops are unequally developed, and therefore their nutritive needs are\r\nunlike; but it is, no doubt, chiefly connected with the fact that the\r\nplant takes up from a highly fertilized soil more of each or every\r\nelement than is essential for growth. The nearly certain conclusion is\r\nthat every one of the crops analysed contains more of some elements than\r\nbelongs to its nutrition. It is quite certain that the average of the\r\nanalyses of the New England tobaccos is fully up to the mark as regards\r\nthe necessities of the crop. It is, indeed, not improbable that the\r\nlowest percentages of each ingredient are quantities sufficient for a\r\nperfect crop. Still, it is not proved that lime may not partially take\r\nthe place of potash, or the reverse. The probability of such a\r\nsubstitution is great upon the face of most of the analyses. As a rule,\r\nthose which show most potash show least lime and _vice versâ_; but in\r\none sample both ingredients are considerably below the average. The\r\npractical issue of these considerations is to give great probability to\r\nthe view that the tobacco crop is fed unnecessarily (and wastefully?)\r\nhigh.” (Prof. Johnson.)\r\n\r\nTobacco is usually characterized as a very exhausting crop. This is not\r\ntrue as regards the amount of nutriment taken from the soil, for in this\r\nrespect tobacco is less exacting than hay, potatoes, or rye. It demands\r\nchiefly potash and lime, with phosphoric acid and nitrogen. Prof.\r\nJohnson recommends for the manuring of one acre, besides ploughing in\r\nthe stalks of the plants, 500 lb. rock guano or 800 lb. fish guano, 500\r\nlb. kainit (potash salts), and 50 lb. quicklime. But surely it cannot be\r\nadvisable to mix quicklime with an ammoniacal manure like guano; it\r\nseems to the writer that gypsum, or spent calcium oxide from gasworks,\r\nwould be a far preferable medium for conveying lime to the soil.\r\n\r\nAs observed by Johnson, the “demand made on the soil or on fertilizers\r\nby the tobacco crop, is for certain reasons greater than that made by\r\nother crops which receive more of nearly every kind of plant food. Hay\r\nis more exhausting than tobacco as measured by total export from the\r\nsoil, but grass grows the whole year throughout, save when the ground is\r\nfrozen or covered with snow, or for more than 8 months. The period of\r\nactive growth which is required to mature a hay crop, begins indeed in\r\nApril, and is finished by July, a period of 3 months, but during the\r\nyear previous, for at least 5 months, in case of the first crop, the\r\ngrass plants have been getting a hold upon the soil, filling it with\r\ntheir roots, and storing up food in their root-stocks or bulbs, for the\r\nmore rapid aftergrowth. Tobacco on the other hand cannot be set out in\r\nthe field before about the 10th of June, and should be in the shed in\r\nabout 3 months. Its growth then must be a very rapid one, and the\r\nsupplies of food in the soil must be very abundant so that the\r\nquick-extending roots may be met at every point with their necessary\r\npabulum. A crop of 1260 lb. dry leaves requires about 1100 lb. of dry\r\nstalks to support the leaves, making a total of 2360 lb. of dry\r\nvegetable matter. As new hay contains not less than one-sixth of\r\nmoisture, we increase the above dry weight of the tobacco crop by\r\none-sixth, to make a fair comparison, and obtain as the yield of an\r\naverage tobacco field 2750 lb. of air-dry vegetable matter, or more than\r\n1⅓ tons. The matter stands then thus: An acre of first-rate grass land\r\nyields as the result of 8 months’ growth, 2¾ tons of crop, while the\r\ntobacco land must yield 1⅓ tons in 3 months.\r\n\r\n“If the above data are correct, the _average_ rate of growth of tobacco\r\nis greater than that of a corresponding hay crop, in the ratio of 9:7.\r\nThe real disparity is, however, much greater. The principal growth of\r\ntobacco is accomplished in the hottest summer weather, and in a period\r\nof some 40–50 days. Very heavy manurings are therefore essential to\r\nprovide for its nourishment, and the more so because the best tobacco\r\nlands are light in texture, and may suffer great loss by drainage,\r\nevaporation, and decomposition.”\r\n\r\nFrom these premises, Prof. Johnson advances to the question of what\r\nshould or should not be presented to the plant in the form of manure. He\r\ncommences with a caution that, in general, growers must “avoid employing\r\nfertilizers which contain salt or other chlorine compound in raising\r\nwrapping or smoking tobacco. It is evident, also, that there is no\r\noccasion to use any fertilizer for the special object of supplying\r\nphosphoric acid, since the heaviest export of this substance does not\r\nexceed 10 lb. per acre, annually. It may be well to mention here that\r\nphosphates which may be put upon a tobacco field, in guano, &c., cannot\r\nsuffer waste by washing out, and will come to use when grain or grass\r\nshall follow in the rotation.”\r\n\r\nHe observes of gypsum (lime sulphate) that it is “a valuable application\r\nto tobacco, not because it is very largely taken up by the crop, for the\r\ngreatest export of sulphuric acid, viz. 20 lb. per acre, is restored by\r\n50 lb. of plaster, and the greatest export of lime, 120 lb., is made\r\ngood by 400 lb. of the sulphate, but because lime sulphate dissolves in\r\n400 times its weight of water, and may rapidly wash out of the porous\r\ntobacco lands, and especially because the solution of lime sulphate in\r\nthe soil is a very effective agent in rendering soluble and accessible\r\nto crops the potash and magnesia, which too often exist in close-locked\r\ncombinations. The average annual rainfall (snow included) in our\r\nlatitudes, is no less than 10,000,000 lb. per acre. This enormous\r\nquantity of water would be enough to dissolve and wash out of the soil\r\n25,000 lb. of gypsum per acre if it had time to saturate itself, and\r\nthen flowed off. In fact, but a small proportion of the rainfall runs\r\nthrough and out of the soil, not more than 10 to 20 per cent., according\r\nto its porosity and situation; but it is plain that there is nothing to\r\nhinder the waste of a hundred pounds or more of gypsum per acre yearly,\r\nSince all investigations go to show that the soil has no retaining power\r\nfor lime sulphate as it has for potash and for phosphoric acid. In\r\nNessler’s experiments, gypsum had an excellent effect on the burning\r\nquality of the tobacco raised under its application, an effect\r\nattributable, he believes, to the fact that this fertilizer often\r\nliberates potash in the soil, as Liebig and Deherain have demonstrated,\r\nand is therefore equivalent to an application of potash, provided the\r\nlatter actually exists in the soil.\r\n\r\n“Potash is exported in the tobacco crop to the amount of 70–80 lb. per\r\nacre yearly, and is required for the stalks to the extent of some 50\r\nlb., making a total of 120–130 lb. As already intimated, potash does not\r\ncommonly waste from the soil by washing. It is seldom found in\r\nappreciable quantity in well or drain water, and most soils absorb it\r\nand fix it so firmly that water can remove it but very slowly. It does,\r\nhowever, appear in the drain water from very heavily dunged fields,\r\nthough in small proportion. Stable or yard manure on the average\r\ncontains one-half per cent. of potash, or 10 lb. per ton. Twelve or\r\nthirteen tons of stable manure would therefore contain the potash\r\nneedful to produce a crop. The dressing of 20 tons of 10 cords of stable\r\nmanure, per acre, which is often employed on tobacco, is doubtless\r\nenough to fully supply the crop, and the application of additional\r\npotash is apparently quite unnecessary. The employment of potash salts\r\nupon tobacco lands would therefore seem to be uncalled for unless the\r\namount of stable manure is greatly diminished, or its quality is very\r\ninferior. In case potash salts are to be applied, the best form to make\r\nuse of is potash sulphate, of which 250 lb. contains 135 of potash. Next\r\nto this is probably potash carbonate, i. e. the ordinary potash of\r\ncommerce, which contains some 70 per cent. of potash; 200 lb. of this\r\nwould be sufficient for an acre. To apply it I would suggest breaking it\r\nup into small pieces and soaking it in two or three times its weight of\r\nwater until the lumps crush easily, and mixing these with so much ground\r\ngypsum as will make a mass dry enough to handle.\r\n\r\n“Kainit, which contains some 15 to 20 per cent. of potash, but also 10\r\nper cent. or more of chlorine, is not so good for leaf tobacco, and\r\nleast of all to be recommended is potassium chloride (muriate of potash)\r\nwhich is nearly half chlorine.\r\n\r\n“Magnesia is an element which is abundantly provided for in stable\r\nmanure, every ton of which, according to analyses on record, contains\r\nsome 3 lb. of this substance.\r\n\r\n“Lime is supplied in relative abundance in stable manure, the average\r\nton of which contains some 15 lb. We have seen that 600 lb. of gypsum\r\ncontain as much lime as the average tobacco crop: guano, dry fish, and\r\nsuperphosphate, each contains some 5–10 per cent. of lime. There is,\r\nfurthermore, little likelihood that any soil intended for tobacco would\r\nnot of itself contain enough lime to support the crop. Lime in the\r\ncaustic state has, however, a value independent of its direct nutritive\r\npower, which is well worth the attention of the tobacco raiser. Of this\r\nI shall write briefly in a subsequent paragraph.\r\n\r\n“Nitrogen in absolutely dry New England tobacco leaf ranges from 3·2 to\r\n5·1 per cent., or 4·24 as the average. This is a larger proportion than\r\nexists in any of our ordinary field crops, except the seeds of legumes.\r\nThe grain of wheat and red clover hay contain when dry scarcely 2½ per\r\ncent., and they exceed all other usually raised vegetable products,\r\nexcept the leguminous seeds. The pea and bean contain, when dry, 4·5 to\r\n4·7 per cent. of nitrogen. The acreage export of nitrogen is\r\nnevertheless not large according to the data of our tables. It should be\r\nremembered, however, that the average is derived from 5 samples only....\r\nThere are reasons to suppose that this result is too low. Furthermore it\r\nis not improbable that tobacco loses nitrogen during the curing\r\nprocess.”\r\n\r\nThe advantages of artificial manuring have been made manifest in all\r\nbranches of agriculture, and there is no doubt that the nitrogenous\r\nqualities of farmyard dung may be replaced by soda nitrate, ammonia\r\nsulphate, &c., only it must be remembered that these have not nearly the\r\nlasting effect of dung, the latter liberating its ammonia but slowly.\r\nIndeed “when a soil has been heavily dunged for a term of years, it\r\naccumulates a large quantity of nitrogen, which is comparatively inert\r\nand therefore nearly useless to crops. Quicklime assists to convert this\r\nnitrogen into the active forms of ammonia or nitrates,” hence Prof.\r\nJohnson’s suggestion that an “application of lime may sometimes be\r\nadvantageously substituted for one of stable manure. In fact, it is not\r\nimprobable that moderate doses of lime might be turned under with stable\r\nmanure or green crops, with the effect of exalting the action of these\r\nfertilizers, and obtaining from them a larger return of nitrogenous\r\nplant food. Lime, however, gives effect to the nitrogen of the soil by\r\ncausing the destruction of the organic matters—_humus_—in which this\r\nnitrogen lies in an inactive state. These organic matters have\r\nthemselves a value independent of their nitrogen, which must be taken\r\naccount of, and therefore the use of lime must be undertaken cautiously,\r\nand with an intelligent comprehension of the various effects which it\r\nmay produce.”\r\n\r\n_Rotation._—A proper rotation of crops is particularly advantageous for\r\nthe cultivation of tobacco, since it requires a great amount of readily\r\naccessible inorganic matter in the soil, especially potash and lime.\r\nAlthough the importance of cultivating tobacco in rotation is admitted,\r\nthere may be circumstances that justify the growth of this crop\r\nconsecutively for several years in the same field. In America, tobacco\r\nis grown successively for several years on new land, where the elements\r\nof plant food exist in such abundance that the crop may be thus\r\ncultivated without for a time showing any notable decrease in yield; it\r\nis even said that the outturn of the second year is heavier than that of\r\nthe first. In Hungary and Holland, the best tobacco is grown for many\r\nyears in succession on the same land. There the plan is adopted partly\r\nout of necessity and partly for convenience. The small landholder is\r\noften obliged to grow tobacco on the same field, because he has only one\r\nproperly fitted for it; for convenience, he grows it every year on the\r\nsame place near his homestead, to allow of the closest attention to the\r\ncrop, but he manures heavily. Nessler, in Carlsruhe, cultivated tobacco\r\nduring six consecutive years in the same field, without noticing any\r\nperceptible decrease in yield or quality. To admit of such a system, the\r\nsoil must either be very rich in the essential elements, or be heavily\r\nmanured, as is the practice in Holland. It is generally assumed that,\r\nwhen tobacco is grown on the same field in succession, the leaves do not\r\nbecome so large after the first year, but grow thicker and more gummy,\r\nand contain less water.\r\n\r\nFrom the foregoing, it would appear that, although tobacco may be grown\r\nsuccessfully on the same land uninterruptedly under special\r\ncircumstances, the cultivator will find it advantageous to adopt some\r\nplan of rotation. Cereals and pulses are very well adapted for this\r\npurpose, the reason being that tobacco removes but little phosphoric\r\nacid from the soil, and thus leaves it rich in the element most\r\nnecessary for the growth of cereals. It has also been found that hemp\r\nthrives particularly well after tobacco.\r\n\r\nJudson Popenoe suggests that there “should be a good coat of clover to\r\nplough under; if the ground is naturally rich, this alone will make a\r\ngood crop, but hog and stable manure, well rotted, is what the tobacco,\r\nas well as any other crop, delights in, and the more manure the better\r\nthe tobacco. The plan that I am now experimenting on is, as soon as I\r\ncut my tobacco in the fall I give the ground a good harrowing, and then\r\ndrill in wheat; the ground being well cultivated all the fall, is clear\r\nof weeds and mellow and needs no ploughing. In the spring I sow clover,\r\nafter the wheat is off; I keep the stock off until about September, to\r\ngive the clover a chance to harden and spread. I then let the stock eat\r\nas low as they want to, which drives the clover to root, and causes the\r\ncrown to spread; I do not suffer stock to run on the clover during\r\nwinter or spring; about the last of May or first of June I plough the\r\nclover under, which is now in blossom, and so I alternately keep two\r\nfields in tobacco and wheat, at the same time feeding the ground a crop\r\nof clover every two years; in this way I expect my land to increase in\r\nfertility all the time. The clover turned under makes food for the\r\ncut-worms, and they trouble the tobacco-plants but little.”\r\n\r\n_Selection of Sort._—The cultivator must carefully compare the\r\nrequirements of the different sorts, and the means at his disposal to\r\nsatisfy them, before making his selection. Though tobacco is a hardy\r\nplant, and grows under varied conditions, yet to become a remunerative\r\ncrop, the plant should not be placed under circumstances very dissimilar\r\nfrom those to which it has been accustomed. By importing seed of a fine\r\nsort directly from its native land, the plants will not retain in the\r\nnew habitat all their special qualities, unless climate, soil and\r\ntreatment are nearly the same. Climate must first be considered. Fine\r\nand valuable tobacco is a product of tropical countries: in a warm and\r\nhumid climate, by employing common means, tobacco may be made to yield a\r\nprofit not attainable in less favoured regions. A warm, moist climate\r\npermits the selection of those sorts that command the highest prices; if\r\nto this be added a suitable soil, and proper treatment, the cultivation\r\nof tobacco yields a profit not easily obtainable from any other crop.\r\n\r\nAs the Havanna tobaccos command the highest prices, the cultivator\r\nnearly everywhere attempts to introduce and cultivate them. There is no\r\ngreat difficulty in raising plants of these varieties, but they speedily\r\ndegenerate and form new varieties, if the climatic conditions, &c., are\r\nnot favourable. Virginian tobacco was previously extensively cultivated,\r\nbut has of late been frequently replaced by the Maryland kind. It is\r\nstill much favoured by cultivators in temperate climates, as it does not\r\nrequire a high temperature. On account of its botanical characteristics,\r\nit is usually not much liked by manufacturers of cigars; some varieties,\r\nhowever, that have less of the marked specific characters, yield\r\ntolerably fine leaves for cigars. As the price of this tobacco is rather\r\nlow, it is not so well suited for export. Hungarian tobacco is\r\nconsidered to be very hardy, but is less valuable than the foregoing.\r\nThe leaves are generally small, and possess a peculiar aroma.\r\n\r\nA high price is generally commanded, irrespective of the species, by\r\nthose tobaccos that possess a large, smooth, thin, elastic leaf,\r\npossessing a fine golden colour and a good aroma; the ribs and veins\r\nshould be thin, and the former should branch off from the midrib at\r\nnearly right angles, and should be far apart from each other. The lower\r\nthe percentage of the weight in ribs, the thinner and broader the leaf,\r\nand the fewer the leaves torn, the more wrappers can be cut out of 1 lb.\r\nof tobacco, other conditions being equal, and consequently the higher is\r\nthe price of the article. The cigar-manufacturer often does not\r\nappreciate the aroma so much as the other qualities. He can do nothing\r\nto improve the botanical characters: the finest aromatic leaf would be\r\nof little value to him if it were torn; but he is to a certain extent\r\nable artificially to improve defects in flavour. Of all kinds, Maryland\r\nis considered to possess the qualities that distinguish a good tobacco\r\nin the highest degree. Some of the Havanna tobaccos belong to this sort,\r\nas also the Ohio, Amersfort, Turkish, and Dutten tobaccos. Its\r\ncultivation assumes larger proportions every year, and the number of\r\nvarieties and sub-varieties increases accordingly. Perhaps the finest\r\nwrappers for cigars are grown in Manilla.\r\n\r\nOn this subject, Judson Popenoe remarks that he has “cultivated various\r\nkinds of tobacco, but have come to the conclusion that what we call the\r\nOhio seed-leaf is the best and most profitable kind for general\r\ncultivation. There are other kinds of tobacco that sometimes are\r\nprofitable, and do well, but most of these do not cure out so well, nor\r\ncolour so evenly, nor are they so fine and saleable as the seed-leaf.\r\nThe Havanna tobacco is too small and has not the fine flavour of the\r\nimported. The Connecticut seed-leaf I believe to be identical with our\r\nOhio seed-leaf; the difference in the climate may make a slight\r\nvariation in the quality, but we plant the Connecticut seed-leaf here in\r\nOhio, and I do not think they can be told apart.”\r\n\r\nSchneider recommends the following varieties: “1. Connecticut seed-leaf,\r\nprincipally for cigar-wrappers; 2. Cuba, for fillers and wrappers; 3.\r\nMaryland; 4. Virginia, the last two principally for smoking and chewing\r\ntobacco. For snuff everything may be used, the refuse and even the\r\nstems. The Connecticut, Maryland, and Virginia yield the largest crops,\r\nthe Cuba the smallest but best. The first varieties yield about one\r\nthousand pounds, the latter five hundred pounds. In very favourable\r\nseasons double the amount may be raised. All tobacco-seed, which is\r\nremoved from its native clime and soil, will deteriorate, and the seed\r\nmust be renewed from its native place, although the seed may, when it\r\nfinds favourable soil, &c., yield just as good, if not a better\r\nvariety.”\r\n\r\nIn Virginia, remarks Thomas, there are “as many varieties of\r\ntobacco-seed as of corn or wheat. I will name a few: The Big Frederic,\r\nthe Little Frederic, the Blue Stalk, the Brittle Stem, the Big Orinoco,\r\nthe Little Orinoco, and half-a-dozen others, each having, or supposed to\r\nhave, some characteristic distinguishing it from all the others. But the\r\nBrittle Stem and the Orinocos were the varieties mostly cultivated, the\r\nformer for its early maturity, the latter for its comparative heaviness.\r\nThere are several varieties, also, in this vicinity, such as the Brittle\r\nStem, the Graham Tobacco, and the Cuban, but the names convey little\r\ncertain information, as the same varieties bear different names in\r\ndifferent localities. But some varieties are evidently to be preferred\r\nto others—one noted for early maturity, all things else equal, is\r\npreferable to another that ripens late. One distinguished for fineness\r\nof texture, all things else equal, is better than another of coarser\r\nfibre, &c. Upon the whole, the surest and most profitable variety is\r\nthat which ripens earliest, and yields the largest number of pounds,\r\ncured, to a given number of hills planted.”\r\n\r\nIn the opinion of Perry Hull, a grower in Litchfield county,\r\nConnecticut, “the variety best adapted to our purpose is that known in\r\nthis State as the Bull Tongue. The leaf is neither too long nor too\r\nshort; the length and width being in such good proportion that\r\nmanufacturers considered there is less waste than there is to a very\r\nlong narrow leaf, or a very broad short leaf. It yields well, and ripens\r\nat least one week earlier than-many of the broader varieties. Almost any\r\nof the seed-leaf varieties will do well; but never patronize any of the\r\nhumbugs sent from the Patent Office, under the name of Graham tobacco,\r\nMaryland broad leaf, &c. They are a Southern tobacco, and when grown\r\nupon that soil, make chewing-tobacco; but here it is good for nothing\r\nfor that purpose, and is too coarse for cigar-wrappers.”\r\n\r\nAccording to Dennis, an Indiana planter, “selection of seed depends upon\r\nthe kind of land you have and the quality of tobacco you wish to raise.\r\nRich, fertile bottom-lands will grow only heavy, strong tobacco, and it\r\nis the interest of the farmer to select that kind of seed that will\r\nproduce the plant of the greatest weight; in other words, to make weight\r\nthe prominent object in the result of the crop. Thinner, poorer land\r\nwill produce tobacco of lighter weight, but of finer and more desirable\r\nquality, and one that will bring a correspondingly higher price. The\r\nOrinoco tobacco is raised extensively in Missouri and Kentucky for heavy\r\ntobacco, and is known in market as Kentucky Leaf. The seed for the finer\r\nqualities passes (as does the other also) under different names, but may\r\nbe procured in Pike and Calloway counties, Missouri, and in Virginia;\r\nthe Orinoco, and kindred kinds, in Howard and Chariton counties in\r\nMissouri. I should suggest that the seed may be procured through the\r\nagents of express-companies at Glasgow, Brunswick, and Renick for the\r\nOrinoco, and at Louisiana or Fulton for the other qualities. I would\r\nrecommend the culture of the coarser, heavier kinds, for the reason that\r\nthe finer quality needs much more care and experience in the handling,\r\nin order that it may go into market in a condition to command such a\r\nprice as its quality, when well handled, entitles it to.”\r\n\r\nIn the words of Libhart, a Pennsylvanian farmer, the “best variety for\r\ncultivation in a high northern latitude is the Connecticut seed-leaf, as\r\nit ripens two weeks earlier than most any other variety, cures and\r\ncolours better, and commands the highest price in the market. The\r\nPennsylvania seed-leaf outstrips the Connecticut in size and weight, but\r\nowing to its requiring a longer time to mature in, is not so well\r\nadapted to climates north of 41° or 42°.”\r\n\r\nAn experienced Missouri grower, named Pursley, remarks that there “are\r\nmore than twenty distinct varieties, of which I will only mention the\r\nmost valuable:—The Yellow Prior, Blue Prior, Orinoco, Little Frederic,\r\nBig Frederic, Cuba, and Spanish tobacco. These are considered the most\r\nvaluable in this State. The Yellow Prior and Orinoco are the most\r\nprofitable.\r\n\r\n“I prefer the Yellow Prior, as it is the easiest cultivated and is the\r\nmost fine and smooth of the many varieties. Some growers prefer the\r\nOrinoco, on account of it being the heaviest. I do not for various\r\nreasons: it has large stiff fibres and ruffled stalks, which afford\r\nhiding-places for insects; it moulds easier, is harder to cure, and\r\ngenerally does not bring as good a price as the Yellow Prior.”\r\n\r\n_Seed._—The best and strongest plants are selected for affording seed.\r\nThese are not “topped” like the remainder of the crop, and are left\r\nstanding when the crop is gathered. All suckers are carefully removed\r\nfrom the stems, and sometimes from the leaves also. When the crop is\r\ncut, the seed-stalks should be staked, to prevent their destruction by\r\nthe wind. As soon as the seed-pods blacken, the seed is ripe; the heads\r\nare then cut off below the forks of the plant, and are hung in a dry and\r\nsafe place to cure. Care must be taken to gather them before frost has\r\nimpaired their vitality. During leisure time, the pods are stripped from\r\nthe stalks, and the seed is rubbed out by hand, and winnowed. Its\r\nvitality is proved by its crackling when thrown upon a hot stove.\r\n\r\n_Seed-beds._—A very light friable soil is necessary for the seed-beds;\r\nto obtain this, it should be broken up to a depth of 1½ ft. some months\r\nbefore the sowing season. A drain is dug around the beds, and the soil\r\nis utilized in raising the surface. In America, a very warm and\r\nsheltered situation, such as the south end of a barn, is selected for\r\nthe seed-beds. It is a common plan there to burn a brush-heap over the\r\nground, thus supplying potash and killing weeds. The time for sowing in\r\nAmerica is usually from the middle of March to the 10th of April, or as\r\nsoon as the ground admits of working in the spring; in India, it depends\r\nupon the locality: when the monsoon rains are very heavy, it should\r\nfollow them; in other cases, it may precede them.\r\n\r\nUnless the soil be very rich in humus, it should be heavily manured with\r\nwell-preserved farmyard manure soon after breaking up. The soil of a\r\ntobacco nursery cannot contain too much organic matter; the presence of\r\nmuch humus will prevent, to a great extent, the formation of a surface\r\ncrust, which is so detrimental to the development of the plants during\r\ntheir early growth, and will also facilitate the extraction of the\r\nplants when transplanting takes place. After a few weeks have elapsed,\r\nthe soil should be dug over a second time, and the whole be reduced to a\r\nfine tilth. The land may now remain untouched until the sowing-time,\r\nunless weeds should spring up: these must be eradicated.\r\n\r\nThe area required for a nursery depends on the area of ground to be\r\nplanted, and on the distance separating the plants in the field. About 1\r\nsq. in. space should be allotted to each of the young plants in the\r\nnursery. Taking the number to be 7260 plants required for an acre (at 3\r\nft. × 2 ft.), and giving each plant 1 sq. in. of room, an area of 7000\r\nsq. in. or 50 sq. ft. would raise plants sufficient for an acre. But as\r\nsome are injured during growth, many rendered useless in lifting them\r\nfor transplanting, and more needed to replace those that die after\r\ntransplanting, double the number should be raised, or 100 sq. ft. of\r\nnursery bed for an acre.\r\n\r\nThe amount of seed required for an acre depends chiefly on its vitality.\r\nAn ounce contains about 100,000 seeds, or sufficient for nearly 7 acres\r\nif all grew; but as even the best has not a very high percentage of\r\nvitality, ½-1 oz. is generally sown to produce the plants required for\r\none acre.\r\n\r\nSowing-time having arrived, the nursery is divided into beds, most\r\nconveniently, 10 ft. long and 5 ft. wide, making 50 sq. ft. each, on\r\nwhich plants for ½ acre can easily be raised. As, even with a small\r\ntobacco plantation, several days are required for transplanting, all the\r\nbeds should not be sown at one time, but at intervals of a few days.\r\nThis will also lessen the risk of the young plants being all destroyed\r\nby a storm, insects, &c. Before sowing the seed, the soil is dug over to\r\nthe depth of 6 inches, and levelled with a rake. The seed must then be\r\nsown evenly on the surface, and beaten down slightly with the hand or\r\notherwise. The seed being very small, many cultivators mix it with\r\nashes, or pulverized gypsum, in order to distribute it regularly over\r\nthe bed. The seed must be covered only slightly, best done by strewing a\r\nlittle fine compost manure over it. Ants, which often destroy the seeds,\r\nmay be kept off by sprinkling some ashes over the bed. Finally cut straw\r\nmay be scattered over the surface. In India, to protect the nursery from\r\nthe sun and rain, the whole is covered with a roof made of straw,\r\nleaves, or cloth, supported by poles, at only a few feet above the\r\nground. The soil must be kept constantly moist, but not wet; weak liquid\r\nmanure may be used for watering. Much time is saved by starting the seed\r\nin a warm room before sowing.\r\n\r\nThe plants, which will appear about a week after sowing, are very tender\r\nduring the first stage of their growth, and require frequent watering\r\nthrough a fine rose. The straw will now prevent the water falling with\r\nany force immediately on the plants, and its tendency to wash the soil\r\nfrom the fine rootlets. If the plants spring up thickly, they are\r\nthinned out, when about a week or two old, leaving about 1 sq. in. for\r\neach. Those taken out may be used to fill blanks in the nursery bed, or,\r\nif more plants are taken out than are required for this purpose, they\r\nshould be planted in a separate bed. It is universally acknowledged that\r\nplants transplanted when very young develop more roots, grow more\r\nvigorously, and become more hardy afterwards, than when not transplanted\r\nat this stage. When the plants are about two weeks old, they require\r\nless attention, and should be watered less frequently, to harden them\r\nbefore transplanting. Any weeds appearing must be removed, and injurious\r\ninsects must be killed. In about 7–8 weeks after sowing, the plants will\r\nbe fit for transplanting.\r\n\r\nBowie, a Maryland planter, gives his experience in the following\r\nwords:—“After a thorough burning of brush, dig deep, and continue to\r\ndig, rake, and chop until every clod, root, and stone be removed; then\r\nlevel and pulverize nicely with a rake. As to the variety to plant, I\r\nthink the Cuba is a very good kind for our climate. The Connecticut\r\nseed-leaf is the best, but culture has more than anything else to do\r\nwith the quality. Mix 1 gill of seed for every 10 square yards with a\r\nquart of plaster or sifted ashes, and sow it regularly in the same\r\nmanner that gardeners sow small seeds, only with a heavier hand; roll\r\nwith a hand-roller or tramp it with the feet. If the bed is sown early,\r\nit ought to be covered with brush free from leaves; but it is not\r\nnecessary to cover it after the middle of March. Tobacco-beds may be\r\nsown at any time during the winter if the ground be not too wet or\r\nfrozen. The best time for sowing is from the 10th to the 20th of March,\r\nthough it is safest to sow at intervals, whenever the land is in fine\r\norder for working. Never sow unless the land is in good order, for the\r\nwork will be thrown away if the land be too moist or be not perfectly\r\nprepared. The beds must be kept free from grass or weeds, which must be\r\npicked out one at a time by the fingers. It is a tedious and troublesome\r\noperation, therefore you should be very careful not to use any manures\r\non your beds which have grass or weed-seeds in them. After the plants\r\nare up, they should receive a slight top-dressing of manure once a week,\r\nsown broadcast by the hand. This manure should be composed of ½ bushel\r\nof unleached ashes (or 1 bushel of burnt turf), 1 bushel of fresh virgin\r\nwoods-earth, 1 gallon of plaster, ½ gallon of soot, 1 quart of salt\r\ndissolved in 2 gallons of liquid from barnyard, and 4 lb. of pulverized\r\nsulphur, the whole well intermixed. Let a large quantity be got together\r\nearly in the spring, or winter rather, and put away in barrels for use\r\nwhen wanted. This, and other such mixtures, have been found efficacious\r\nin arresting the ravages of the fly—both from the frequent dusting of\r\nthe plants and the increased vigour which it imparts to them, thereby\r\nenabling the plant the sooner to get out of the tender state in which\r\nthe fly is most destructive to it. The fly is a small black insect,\r\nsomewhat like the flea, and delights in cold, dry, harsh weather, but\r\ndisappears with the mild showers and hot suns of opening summer. If\r\npossible, the plants should stand in the bed from ½ inch to 1 inch\r\napart, and if they are too thick they must be raked when they have\r\ngenerally become as large as 5 or 10-cent pieces. The rake proper for\r\nthe purpose should be a small common rake, with iron teeth 3 inches\r\nlong, curved at the points, teeth flat, and ⅜ inch wide, and set ½ inch\r\napart.”\r\n\r\nSchneider, whose success as an Illinois planter has already been\r\nmentioned, expresses himself thus:—“Raising tobacco-plants from seed is\r\nsomewhat similar to raising cabbage-plants, but is different in two\r\nimportant things: It takes considerably more time for the seed to sprout\r\n(six weeks), and, on account of disturbing the roots, cannot well stand\r\nweeding. Therefore the principal care in providing the seed-bed is, to\r\nprepare for the early starting of the seed, and to have the bed free\r\nfrom all weed-seeds. In the West we prepare the seed-bed in the\r\nfollowing manner: we take a plot of land—newly cleared land is\r\npreferred—sloping southward, and protected against winds. The bed should\r\nbe 4 feet broad and 8 feet long; on this we pile brush, wood, and heavy\r\nlogs, sufficient to keep up a strong fire for at least one hour, and\r\nburn it. When the coals begin to die out, or before the soil is cold,\r\nthe bed is cleared off, and only the fine ashes are left; then it is\r\nhoed thoroughly and as deep as the strongest heat has penetrated, after\r\nwhich it is raked cross and lengthwise, until the soil is entirely\r\npulverized. Everything that might hinder the growing of the plants, and\r\ntheir taking out afterwards, is carefully removed. On this bed a\r\nthimbleful of seed, well mixed with a few handfuls of ashes or earth, is\r\nsown broadcast, and tramped in with the feet, or slapped with the under\r\nside of the spade or any other suitable instrument. After this, the bed\r\nis thoroughly wetted with a weak manure-water, 12 lb. of hen-droppings,\r\nor 1 lb. of soot in 10 gallons of water, and lightly covered with straw.\r\nThe seed-bed does not need much attention at first, if the weather\r\nremains mild; but if there is danger of night-frosts, a layer of brush\r\nmust be made, and on this a layer of straw 2 to 4 inches thick,\r\naccording to the degree of frost. The straw is removed in the morning,\r\nand put on again at evening, leaving it off entirely when the nights are\r\nmild. Although the seed-bed is ready now, it must not be left to itself,\r\nand requires some care. The plants must always have sufficient moisture,\r\nand if timely rains do not fall, they must be watered with weak liquid\r\nmanure as often as needed. Should weeds appear, notwithstanding all\r\nprecautions, they must be removed with the utmost care. The\r\nabove-mentioned quantity of seed is sufficient to raise plants for one\r\nacre.\r\n\r\n“Whoever is in possession of a hot-bed can raise the plants much easier;\r\nhe can sow later and have plants earlier and with more certainty. But\r\neven the common bed may be made into a kind of hot-bed. The burned and\r\nhoed surface soil is removed and put on one side, then one foot of fresh\r\nhorse-dung is laid on the subsoil, and the surface soil put back again.\r\nBoards may be placed around, cross-pieces laid over them, and the straw\r\ncovering put on these.\r\n\r\n“The earlier the young plants are ready for transplanting the surer the\r\ntobacco crop will be. March is the latest to make the seed-bed in the\r\nopen air, and June the latest for transplanting. Some time may be gained\r\nby keeping the seed in damp earth in the room, and sow it in the\r\nseed-bed just before it commences to sprout.”\r\n\r\nHaving selected a suitable location, says White, a Connecticut grower,\r\n“next consider how large a bed you will need. That depends on the\r\nsurface you intend to plant out. A bed 2 rods long, by 12 feet wide,\r\nwill produce a sufficient number of good plants to set an acre. On such\r\na bed you should spread a heavy coat of good, fine, well-rotted manure,\r\nat least 2 inches thick; let it be free from straw or other litter.\r\nThen, with a good strong back, and long-handled spade (or other as you\r\nprefer), spade up the bed, mixing in the manure very fine. Have ready\r\nsome fine dry brush, or the like, and spread over the whole surface; set\r\nit on fire and burn to ashes. A small quantity will answer better than a\r\nvery large one, for if very much is burned, it is apt to do injury by\r\nburning the soil. The less quantity will tend to destroy any foreign\r\nseed turned up, and warm the ground. Having reduced the brush to ashes,\r\ntake a fine iron or steel rake, and proceed to pulverize very finely the\r\nwhole surface spaded up. After reducing it to as fine a state as\r\npossible, and having made it flat and level, leave it till the next day.\r\nThen, with your rake, carefully rake over the whole bed; it is now ready\r\nfor the seed. Sow the seed on broadcast; be careful to sow it even and\r\ntrue. About two thimblefuls, or a little less, will be sufficient for\r\nsuch a bed. It is better to have too little than too much, as in the\r\nfirst instance, the plants will have room to form thick stalky roots and\r\nwell-spread leaves, while in the latter they will be crowded with\r\nspindling tops as well as small roots. Having sowed your seed, take a\r\ngood heavy garden-roller and roll the surface down hard and smooth. In\r\nthe absence of a roll, a very good substitute can be made by taking a\r\npiece of 2-inch plank, say 18 inches long by 14 inches wide; in the\r\ncentre, place an upright handle. With this spat the bed over, being\r\ncareful to do it evenly, and to leave the surface solid and level, the\r\nreasons for which you will afterward discover in weeding and taking out\r\nplants to set in the field. This should be done in the spring, as soon\r\nas the ground will permit, say first of April, if the frost is out and\r\nthe ground settled. The roll or spatter will cover the seed sufficiently\r\nwithout any other covering. To be able to sow the seed with the least\r\ntrouble, mix it in thoroughly with wood-ashes or plaster, before sowing.\r\nTo obtain plants earlier, you can mix your seed thoroughly in about a\r\nquart of light chip dirt from under your wood-shed; put it in some\r\nproper vessel, and wet to the consistence of soft putty, with water as\r\nwarm as can be well borne by the hand. Set it on the mantle-shelf in the\r\nkitchen, not too near the stove or fire, but where it will keep warm. In\r\nthe course of a week or ten days, the seed will have cracked the shell,\r\nand will show the small white germ or sprout. It should now be sowed\r\nbroadcast very evenly, and treat as before described. If properly wet at\r\nfirst, it will need no more water to sprout the seed. Before sowing,\r\npulverize the mass containing the seed, to facilitate the sowing. Having\r\nthus sown and rolled down your bed very nicely, it is well to have\r\nsomething to protect it from the encroachment of the fowls. For this\r\npurpose, spread a net of twine or a few brush over the surface, covering\r\nit so that they may not disturb the surface by scratching and wallowing.\r\nIt may now be left till the weeds begin to make their appearance; these\r\nyou will need to extract by the roots as soon as the plants can be\r\ndistinguished; these last may be known by two very small nearly round\r\nleaves opening over flat on the ground. Now procure a plank or some\r\nsubstitute a little longer than your bed is wide, also two blocks 5 or 6\r\ninches square, as long or longer than your plank is wide; place one on\r\none side of the bed, the other on the opposite side; on these two blocks\r\nplace your plank, and you will have a fine platform on which you can sit\r\nand weed any part, or all, of your bed, by moving it as occasion may\r\nrequire. To assist in pulling out the weeds, procure a moderately\r\nsharp-pointed knife, and with the same grasped in the hand with the\r\nthumb near the point, pinch out the weeds, being careful not to disturb\r\nthe dirt any more than absolutely necessary. The process of weeding must\r\nbe repeated as often as necessary, to keep the bed clean from weeds.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 4.]\r\n\r\nObviously, no frost must be allowed to reach the seedbed when once\r\nsowing has taken place. To prevent this, and for another purpose to be\r\ndescribed presently, Perry Hull advises the construction of a straw mat,\r\nas shown in Fig. 4, which is very light to handle, easily made, and\r\nsufficiently strong to last one season. It is made “by laying a\r\nscantling (6 feet long, 1½ inches wide, ¾ inch thick) upon the barn\r\nfloor; place a layer of good straight rye-straw upon it, so that the\r\nscantling will come about in the middle of the straw, then another layer\r\nwith the tips the other way, that it may be of uniform thickness in all\r\nits parts (about 1½ inches thick). Place a similar scantling exactly\r\nover it, and with sixpenny nails, nail them tight; with an axe trim both\r\nedges straight, and to a width of 3 feet, and the mat is made. With\r\nthese the beds should be covered every night, cold or warm; in the\r\ndaytime they should be set up at the north side of the bed, at an angle\r\nof about 65 degrees, by driving crotches just inside of the bed, for the\r\nend of the scantling to rest in, the lower edge of the mat resting on\r\nthe ground, outside the bed.\r\n\r\n“The plants, as soon as they are out of the ground, which will be in a\r\nfew days, require strict attention. The beds should be made high enough,\r\nso that in fair weather a little water can be applied every night. After\r\nthe fourth leaf appears, manure-water should be used. Place an old\r\nbarrel near the beds, and throw into it ½ bushel of hen-manure, and fill\r\nwith water; after it is well soaked, use ½ pailful of it, and fill up\r\nwith clear water with the chill taken off. As the plants get larger, the\r\nstrength of the infusion can be increased, being careful that it is not\r\nso strong as to turn the plants yellow. As soon as the plants are large\r\nenough to be readily taken hold of by the thumb and point of a knife,\r\nthey should be thinned to about 144 per square foot, and kept free from\r\nweeds. This plan is decidedly preferable to raising under glass. It is\r\nless expensive, the plants are more hardy to set out in the field, are\r\ngot fully as early, and a little carelessness on a hot day will not ruin\r\nthe whole. It has been my method for the past 8 years, and during that\r\ntime I have never failed to have good strong plants ready for the field\r\nbetween the 5th and 10th of June.”\r\n\r\nMitjen, whose essay on tobacco-growing in Cuba has been already\r\nmentioned, recommends a system of shade frames borne on small tramway\r\ntrucks, as illustrated in Fig. 5—(_a_) seed beds, raised above the\r\nsurrounding level; (_b_) light pointed covers of thatch on a wooden\r\nframe, and provided with grooved wheels; (_c_) rails on which the frames\r\nrun, facilitating their application or removal as the vicissitudes of\r\nthe weather may demand.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 5.]\r\n\r\n_Preparation of the Field._—Land intended to be planted with tobacco\r\nshould receive several ploughings not less than 9 inches deep. As a\r\nrule, clay requires to be more deeply ploughed than sandy or loamy soil.\r\nIt greatly conduces to success, if the land is allowed to lie fallow for\r\nseveral months before planting the crop, to admit of the proper\r\npreparation of the soil, by ploughing, rolling, harrowing, &c., and to\r\nallow the attainment of as fine a tilth as is usual in gardens. No crop\r\nwill better repay the expense of proper preparation of the soil than\r\ntobacco; the fineness of the leaf and the aroma of the tobacco depend to\r\na great degree upon this. The land should be ridged immediately before\r\nplanting. The distance apart at which to make the ridges is governed by\r\nthe quality of the soil and the sort of plant to be raised. With good\r\nsoil, the ridges must be farther apart than in a poor one, because of\r\nproducing larger leaves. The ridges should allow a passage between the\r\nrows, for the purpose of weeding, hoeing, suckering, &c., without\r\nbreaking the leaves. In the lines, the plants may be 6 in.–1 ft. closer\r\nthan the ridges. In some places, a plough is run at right angles across\r\nthe ridges before planting, at the distance at which the plants have to\r\nstand in the lines, thus forming small hills on which the seedlings are\r\nplanted.\r\n\r\n_Planting._—Planting should take place only in the evening (or even at\r\nnight in India), unless the weather be cloudy, when it may be performed\r\nduring the whole day. Some hours before commencing to transplant, the\r\nnursery should be thoroughly watered, to facilitate the removal of the\r\nplants, without tearing their roots. If the plants are of even size, so\r\nthat all can be removed, the best plan is to take them out with a spade,\r\nor trowel, leaving a lump of soil on each. But in most cases, it will be\r\nnecessary to take up each plant separately; this should be done very\r\ncarefully, holding with the thumb and forefinger as near as possible to\r\nthe roots, and drawing out the plants, if possible, with a little soil\r\nadhering to their roots., The plants are taken at once in a basket to\r\nthe field for planting. An attendant going between two ridges places a\r\nplant on each hill, right and left. One attendant is sufficient for two\r\nplanters, who follow immediately. The planting is nearly the same as\r\nwith cabbages, but requires more care, the plants being more tender, and\r\ntheir roots and leaves springing nearly from the same point, they are\r\nmore difficult to handle. The plants should be placed in a hollow made\r\non each hill, which will serve as a reservoir for the water to be\r\napplied, and also afford some shade.\r\n\r\nIn India, the plants are watered immediately after planting; they should\r\nalso by some means be shaded during the first few days, which can easily\r\nbe done when only a small area is planted, but is rather difficult to\r\nmanage on a large scale. In the latter case, the shade afforded by\r\nplanting in a slight cavity must suffice. If the plants have been taken\r\nfrom the nursery with some soil adhering to their roots, and are kept\r\nsufficiently moist during the first few days, few of them will die. When\r\nthe weather is dry, water should be applied at morning and evening, and\r\nafter that time, once daily until the plants have taken root, after\r\nwhich, occasional waterings, varying with soil, weather, and kind of\r\nplant, must be given. In dry weather, and with a soil poor in humus, one\r\nwatering every second or third day may be necessary, whereas with a soil\r\nrich in organic matter, and in a moist atmosphere, watering may be\r\nentirely dispensed with. During the first few days, the water is applied\r\nwith a watering-pot, held very low, otherwise the soil would be washed\r\nfrom the plant-roots, and expose them to the direct rays of the sun,\r\ncausing death. The arrangement of the plants in what is known as\r\nquincunx order, as shown in Fig. 6, is generally adopted.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 6.]\r\n\r\nThis part of the operations connected with tobacco-growing is described\r\nat some length by Mitjen so far as the practice rules in Cuba. His\r\ntranslator remarks that “as soon as the land has been prepared, it\r\nshould be furrowed at a distance of 1 yard between each two furrows.\r\nThis operation should be simultaneous with the planting, and should be\r\ndone, if possible, after 3 o’clock in the afternoon, and on cloudy days,\r\nso as to prevent the recently set plants from being scorched by the sun.\r\nThe furrows should run more or less from north to south, as, by making\r\nthem in this direction, the plants are less injured by the sun, or the\r\nstrong winds which generally blow about the planting season.\r\nImmediately, and behind the man who is furrowing, another should follow,\r\nplacing the plants at every ½ foot all along the furrow, and behind them\r\nanother should at once set the plants, the first walking in the\r\ndistance, or bank, and the other in the furrow. The one should open the\r\nland with his right hand, behind which, with his left, the other will\r\nplace the plant, being careful neither to double the stalk nor the\r\nroots, and, letting the ground fall directly on the roots, should press\r\nit lightly on them with his hand. The plants should be buried half-way\r\nup the stalk, or, if the plant is small, it should be covered to where\r\nthe leaves spread. Care should be taken that the plants have no _dry_\r\nmould sticking to their roots, and that no ground from the furrow falls\r\nin the _centre or sprout_, and when the planting is going on, the ground\r\nshould not be too wet. The plants should be set on the side of the\r\nfurrow, and on that side which is next the setting sun, so that the\r\nrising sun may strike upon them, and they may be somewhat protected from\r\nthe rays of the afternoon sun.\r\n\r\n“Generally the plants wither after being transplanted, but on the third\r\nor fourth day after they are set they begin to shoot up, and on the\r\nfifth day or the sixth, those that have not taken root can be\r\ndistinguished. Then, and without loss of time, others should be\r\nsupplied, this operation being repeated at the end of another 5 or 6\r\ndays, so that the whole field may be well filled with living plants.\r\nThis is one of the most important operations for securing a good crop,\r\nbecause the fields will require as much cultivation and labour bestowed\r\non them if they have vacant spots as if they were full and regularly\r\nplanted, and, of course, the yield will be less, besides many other\r\nevils well known to practical _vegueros_.\r\n\r\n“According to the best opinions admitted among _vegueros_, one man can\r\ntake care of 12,000 tobacco plants, and prudence dictates that no more\r\nland should be planted than that which can be well attended to, as\r\nexperience shows that in exceeding this number for each man, instead of\r\nproving advantageous to the planter, it is frequently the cause of\r\nconsiderable loss. Excessive planting produces, at once, an increase of\r\nlabour, and if, unfortunately, a hard year should occur, occasioned by\r\ncaterpillars or other causes, it almost always happens that the man who\r\nhas only planted 12,000 plants, for each labourer he can command,\r\nproduces four times as much tobacco, and of a better quality, than he\r\nwho may have planted from 25,000 to 30,000 plants per labourer.\r\n\r\n“When the plantations are out of proportion to the strength of the\r\nlabour which can be counted on, all the work becomes slowly and badly\r\ndone, and these faults most sensibly prejudice both the yield and the\r\nquality of the crop, and consequently the interest of the planter.\r\nImmediately after supplying the fields, the tobacco plants should be\r\ncarefully inspected, almost daily, in order to exterminate the\r\ncaterpillars of every kind that may be found, and this operation should\r\n_always_ be made during the morning, because in the heat of the day the\r\nworms are accustomed to hide themselves from the sun, and the wind\r\nagitates the leaves too strongly to permit them to be handled without\r\nrisk of being broken or torn, especially when they are somewhat large.”\r\n\r\n_After-cultivation._—After the plants have once taken root, they grow\r\nrapidly. They are hoed when about 6–9 in. high, and the soil is drawn\r\nfrom the furrows to raise the hills, maintaining a depression round the\r\nstems. If the soil is not very rich, a special manure should be applied\r\nat this stage of growth. The best manure generally will be nitre in a\r\nliquid state, which can be applied in the depression around the plants\r\nwith a watering-pot. By applying it in solution and close to the plant,\r\nless is required than when spread over the whole field. Some weeks\r\nafterwards, another hoeing and heaping of earth round the plants will be\r\nnecessary. It is most difficult to say the number of hoeings which may\r\nbe required by a tobacco crop. The general rule to be followed is to\r\nkeep the soil loose, friable, and free from weeds. The more organic\r\nmatter the soil contains, the more will it remain loose and friable; the\r\nless organic matter, the more waterings will be required, which causes\r\nthe soil to crust over, and to assume a close texture, and necessitates\r\nfrequent hoeings. As long as the plants have not spread much, the hoeing\r\nmay be done by a cultivator, followed by some men to perform the\r\nheaping. Insects which attack the tobacco must be carefully sought for\r\nand killed at once. They can easily be discovered in the mornings; if\r\nnot killed, they may destroy the whole crop in a few days. Turkeys are\r\ninvaluable for their grub-eating propensities.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 7.\r\n               THE TOBACCO WORM.]\r\n\r\nWorms, in the American phraseology, here generally known as\r\ncaterpillars, are the _bête noire_ of the tobacco grower. The most\r\ncommon is highly destructive also to the potato and tomato foliage. The\r\nworm as it comes from the egg is so small as to be unobserved, but\r\nhaving an enormous appetite, it devours rapidly, and soon grows to a\r\ngreat size. When not feeding, it lifts up the head and fore-part of the\r\nbody, and remains apparently lifeless. From its resemblance in this\r\nposition to the Egyptian Sphinx, Linnæus gave the name _Sphinx_ to the\r\ngenus. The larva is of a light green colour, with whitish oblique\r\nstripes, and has a horn upon the rear end of the body. Though it is\r\nrepulsive in appearance, it is perfectly harmless to touch, and may be\r\npicked off with the hands without fear. After it has reached its full\r\nsize, it leaves the scene of its ravages and goes into the earth, where\r\nit throws off its skin and becomes a brown-coloured chrysalis. The\r\ncurious projection, like a handle, at the end of the chrysalis, is a\r\nsheath which holds the tongue of the future moth. The moth or perfect\r\ninsect is fully 2 in. long in the body and the spread of its wings\r\nreaches 5 in. It is of a grey colour, with orange-coloured spots on each\r\nside of the body. As there are five of these spots on each side, it is\r\ncalled _Sphinx quinque-maculatus_, or Five-spotted Sphinx. The moths may\r\nbe seen towards night flitting about the flowers, from which they suck\r\nthe juices by means of their remarkable tongue, which is 5–6 inches\r\nlong. When the tongue is not in use, it is closely coiled up and hidden\r\nbetween the two feelers. From the manner of their flight and feeding,\r\nthey are frequently mistaken for humming-birds, and are called\r\n“humming-bird moths,” and “horn-blowers.” The moths should always be\r\ndestroyed if possible; by so doing we prevent the production of several\r\nhundreds of most destructive worms. Naturalists make one or two other\r\nspecies, which closely resemble the Five-spotted Moth, and are only\r\ndistinguished by characters which would not be noticed except by the\r\nentomologist.\r\n\r\nJudson Popenoe gives the following advice with regard to these pests.\r\n“As soon as worms appear, which is generally when the leaves are as big\r\nas a man’s hand, go over the tobacco, looking carefully at every plant.\r\nThe worms usually stay on the under side of the leaf; if you see a hole\r\nin the leaf, no matter how small, raise it up and you will generally\r\nfind a worm under it. Worming can not be done too carefully. Miss one or\r\ntwo worms on a plant, and before you are aware of it the plant is nearly\r\neaten up. When you find a worm, take hold of it with the thumb and\r\nforefinger, giving your thumb that peculiar twist which none but those\r\nwho are practised in it know how to do, and put the proper amount of\r\npressure on, and my word for it you will render his wormship harmless.\r\nWorming has to be continued until the tobacco is cut; the last worming\r\nto immediately precede cutting and housing.”\r\n\r\nSchneider remarks that “from the first starting of the tobacco plant, it\r\nhas its enemies. First appears a cutworm that works in the soil and eats\r\nthe roots off. Then comes a little caterpillar which enjoys itself on\r\nthe young leaves, and lastly the beautiful and large tobacco-worm, which\r\neats into the leaf, and in a short time leaves nothing but the\r\nleaf-stems and stalk. The only remedies against these enemies are the\r\nvigilance and industry of the planter—looking after them, digging up,\r\npicking, and destroying once or twice a day, or as often as there are\r\nany traces of them. Children, to whom premiums are offered, will be very\r\nsuccessful in destroying them. A herd of turkeys, if given access to the\r\ntobacco-field, are a very valuable help. A negro from South Carolina\r\ntold me a few days ago, that a solution of blue vitriol in water,\r\nsprinkled over the plants, will kill the worms. The remedy may be worth\r\ntrying. Of course the solution must be made weak enough, so that it will\r\nnot destroy the plants as well as the worms.”\r\n\r\nOn the same subject, White recommends the planter on the “next, or at\r\nfarthest, the second morning after having set your plants, go over to\r\nsee that the worms do not eat up one-half of them. You can tell where\r\nthey are and have been, by seeing a plant with a single leaf, and\r\nsometimes the whole plant eaten off and drawn down into the hole\r\noccupied by a large brown or black worm; you will see little ant-hills\r\nlike, and round holes in the ground; by poking around a little in the\r\ndirt, you will find a worm very near the mouth of these little holes.\r\nDestroy it, and all you can find, and thus save your crop. This\r\nsearching for worms must be kept up till they cease to do mischief. All\r\nplants missing in the field should be renewed from the bed at the first\r\nopportunity. The morning is the best time to find the worms, as they are\r\nnear the surface of the ground; later, they retire into the ground to\r\nappear again near sundown, and work during the night and early morning.”\r\n\r\nThomas describes tobacco worms as “hatched from eggs deposited by what\r\nis called the ‘tobacco fly.’ It is a large, dusky-brown, winged miller,\r\nnearly as large as a humming-bird. It lays its eggs on fair evenings and\r\nmoonlight nights in July and August. It can be seen almost any clear\r\nevening, among what are called ‘Jimson-weeds,’ sucking the flowers. The\r\neggs will hatch out in 24 hours, and the worms commence eating when less\r\nthan ½ inch long, and continue to eat till they attain the length of 4–5\r\ninches. One worm, in 6 weeks, will destroy a plant so completely as to\r\nrender it utterly valueless. This pest is vastly more numerous in some\r\nseasons than in others. Four years ago there were scarcely any; but for\r\nthe last three years they have been destructively numerous. The worming\r\nof the crop, when they are numerous, is, by far, the most disagreeable\r\nand tedious labour attending it. Much of the value of the crop depends\r\nupon the care or inattention of performing this part of the work. The\r\ncrop may have been planted in good time—ploughed, hoed, primed,\r\nsuckered, topped, cut, and cured well; yet it may have been so riddled\r\nby worms as to be comparatively good for nothing in market; hence, they\r\nmust be picked off and destroyed, and that promptly.”\r\n\r\n_Topping and Suckering._—The plants will commence to flower about two\r\nmonths after planting, when 2–7 feet high. When the flower-buds appear,\r\nthey must be broken off, and with them the top and bottom leaves. By\r\nbreaking off the flower-buds at an early date, the sap that would be\r\nused in the formation of these organs flows to the leaves, which thereby\r\nincrease in size, and the outturn becomes much heavier than when the\r\nplant is allowed to flower. But it is generally admitted that the leaves\r\nlose much in aroma. To what extent the early removal of the flower-buds\r\nimpairs the quality has not been properly investigated. It is very\r\nprobable that the greater yield does not always compensate for the loss\r\nin quality. The bottom leaves are generally of inferior quality, small,\r\ntorn, and dirty. The number of leaves to be left on the plant varies\r\ngreatly, according to species, quality of soil, and method of\r\ncultivation. The minimum may be placed at 6, the maximum at 22. The only\r\nrule to be observed is to retain as many leaves as the plants are able\r\nto mature. Soon after the plants have been topped, suckers appear in the\r\naxils of the leaves; these should be broken off as soon as they come, at\r\nleast they should not be allowed to grow longer than 4 inches. If the\r\nsuckers are not removed soon after their appearance, the size of the\r\nleaves will be seriously impaired. After the plants are half-grown,\r\ngreat care must be taken when going through the lines, whether for the\r\npurposes of hoeing, watering, or suckering, &c., not to tear the leaves.\r\nIn India, hoeing and suckering should be performed only when the leaves\r\nhave lost part of their turgescence, attained at night. Insects,\r\nhowever, must be killed during the morning and evening; at other times,\r\nthey are not easily found. Leaves which are torn are not fit for\r\ncigar-wrappers, and must often be thrown on the refuse heap as\r\nvalueless, even if well developed and of good colour.\r\n\r\nThe plants commence to ripen about three months after being planted;\r\nthis is indicated by the leaves assuming a marbled appearance, and a\r\nyellowish-green colour. The leaves also generally become gummy, and the\r\ntips bend downwards. It is considered that tobacco intended for snuff\r\nshould have attained more maturity than tobacco for smoking. Nessler\r\nfound that the less ripe leaves contained more carbonate of potash, and\r\nburnt consequently better, than the more ripe ones, but the total amount\r\nof potash was larger in the latter than in the former; cigars made from\r\nless ripe leaves kept the fire when lighted for a shorter time than\r\nthose made from more ripe leaves.\r\n\r\nIn the words of Judson Popenoe, the “tobacco is ready to top when the\r\nbutton (as the blossom or top of the stalk is called) has put out\r\nsufficiently to be taken hold of, without injury to the top leaves. As\r\ntobacco is not regular in coming into blossom, it is the usual practice\r\nto let those stalks that blossom first, run a little beyond their time\r\nof topping, and then top all that is in button as you go. There is no\r\nparticular height to top at, but as a general thing 16 to 18 leaves are\r\nleft; judgment is necessary to determine where to top; if topped too\r\nhigh, 2 or 3 of the top leaves are so small as not to amount to much; if\r\ntopped low, the tobacco spreads better; if just coming out in top, reach\r\ndown among the top leaves, and with thumb and forefinger pinch the top\r\nor button off below 2 or 3 leaves; if well out in top, break off several\r\ninches down from the button and 4 or 5 leaves below it. As soon as the\r\ntobacco is topped, the suckers begin to grow; one shoots out from the\r\nstalk at the root of each leaf, on the upper side. When the top suckers\r\nare 3–4 inches long, the suckering should be done; with the right hand\r\ntake hold of the top sucker, with the left take hold of the next, close\r\nto the stalk, and break them off, and so proceed, using both hands,\r\nstooping over the stalk, taking care not to injure the leaf. Break the\r\nsuckers about half-way down the stalk, the balance being too short to\r\nneed removing until the second suckering. In about 2 weeks from topping,\r\nthe tobacco is ready to cut; now give it the last worming and suckering,\r\nbreaking all suckers off down to the ground, and remove every worm, if\r\nyou don’t want your tobacco eaten in the sheds.”\r\n\r\nAnother process, called “priming” by Schneider, is thus described by\r\nhim. “The object of priming is to break off the leaves that come out too\r\nnear the ground, which, when large, lie flat on it, and therefore rot or\r\nget dirty. This work should be done early, the sooner the better, so\r\nthat the plant does not lose much strength by their growing. These\r\nleaves must not be torn off, especially not downward, because the plant\r\nwould be injured, and instead of throwing the strength gained into the\r\nother leaves, it would be thrown away to heal the wound. The distance\r\nfrom the ground at which this priming should be done, depends upon the\r\nvariety grown and upon the time at which the work is done: 4–6 inches is\r\nthe right distance. This priming is not done by every one. One farmer\r\nmay practise it, while his neighbour does not; but sorts the lower\r\nleaves separately, and sells them as so-called ‘lugs,’ for which he gets\r\na little over half the price of the good upper leaves. Those who do not\r\nprime, must generally top lower, or they must risk that the whole plant,\r\nor at least the upper leaves, will not mature fully.\r\n\r\n“Topping is done to throw the strength, which would go to develop seeds,\r\ninto the leaves. It must, therefore, be done as early as the seed-buds\r\nshow themselves, if not earlier. This work must be done, and the\r\nquestion is, how to do it. If there are but few leaves on the plant,\r\neven these will not ripen, if it is not topped; if there are many, then\r\nthe grower has the choice either to break off the flower-stalk only or\r\nto take off one or more leaves also. This should be done in answer to\r\nthe questions: 1st. Is there time enough to ripen even the upper leaves\r\nfully? and, 2nd, Are the plant and the soil strong enough to ripen all\r\nleaves, even the upper ones? The answers to these queries will decide\r\nthe way of topping. If yes, he takes off the flower-stalk only; if no,\r\nhe tops to 8, 10, 12, 14, or 16 leaves, according to his judgment, that\r\nis, he allows so many leaves to remain as will have a good fair chance\r\nof reaching maturity.”\r\n\r\nAs Bishop remarks, cultivators are not agreed on the time and place for\r\ntopping tobacco plants. “Some favour the plan of topping as soon as the\r\nblossom-buds appear, others prefer to wait until in blossom. I think\r\nthere is no harm in letting the earliest plants bloom before being\r\ntopped, but after once beginning, they should be broken off as soon as\r\nthe buds begin to look yellow, and the latest plants as soon as the buds\r\nappear. A new beginner will be apt to top the plants too high. The\r\nobject is to ripen and develop as many leaves as the plant can support;\r\nif topped too high, the top leaves are small, and when cured are nearly\r\nworthless, and the other leaves are not as large or heavy, whereas, if\r\ntopped too low, then you lose one, two, or three leaves, which the plant\r\nmight have supported. As a general rule, a plant just in blossom should\r\nbe topped down to where the leaves are full 7 inches wide, leaving on\r\nthe stalk from 15 to 18 leaves. This will leave the stalks about 2½ feet\r\nhigh in good tobacco. Later in the season, top the plants sooner and\r\nlower. Let as many of the earliest plants as will be wanted remain for\r\nseed. One plant will furnish seed enough to put out 5 acres, at least.\r\nThese should be wormed and suckered like the rest, only leaving the\r\nsuckers above where you would ordinarily break it off, were you to top\r\nit. The piece should now be looked over every other day, to break off\r\nthe suckers and catch the worms. This should be done as soon as the dew\r\nis off in the morning, and towards night, as the worms are eating then,\r\nand can be found more readily, while in the heat of the day they remain\r\nhid. Great care should be taken not to break off the leaves while going\r\nthrough it, as they are nearly all wasted before the crop is ripe. As\r\nsoon as the top is broken off, the sap is thrown into the leaves,\r\ncausing them to expand rapidly. In the meantime suckers will start out\r\njust above where each leaf joins the stalk; these must be broken off, or\r\nthe growth of the leaf will be checked, as the sap will be thrown into\r\nthese young sprouts. Those nearest the top will start soonest, and will\r\nrequire breaking off twice before the plant is ripe; those at the bottom\r\nmust all be broken off. This is the hardest and slowest work of all. Not\r\nonly will these suckers check the growth of the plants, but if allowed\r\nto grow will soon break or pry off the leaves, or cause them to grow out\r\nat right angles from the stalk, rendering them more liable to be broken\r\noff. It is a good plan to have a piece of corn on the north side of a\r\npiece of tobacco, or, at least, two or three rows, to shield the growing\r\nplants from winds.”\r\n\r\nPriming is defined by Thomas as “pulling off the bottom leaves to the\r\nnumber of 4 or 5,” and he says that any plant large enough to be topped\r\nought to be primed first. All conditions being favourable, he considers\r\nthat in Ohio, a “tobacco plant will ripen in as many weeks, from the\r\ntime of topping it, as there are leaves left on the stalk. Consequently,\r\nif the topping is done early, it can be topped high, if later, it must\r\nbe done lower, and if still later, still lower. Planters differ very\r\nmuch at this point. Some will top as high as 16 leaves, others 10, and a\r\ngreat many at 8. My own opinion is, that a plant topped at 10 will weigh\r\nas much as one at 16, topped at the same time, and on the same kind of\r\nland. About a week after a plant has been topped the suckers will begin\r\nto grow. A sucker is only an auxiliary branch which shoots out at the\r\njunction of the leaves to the stalk. If not removed, they will grow, and\r\nbloom, and ripen seed, and in doing so they will ‘suck’ the parent-stem\r\nof much of its vitality. When the crop of suckers are about 1 inch long\r\nthey can be pulled or rubbed off, and it should surely be done. In about\r\na week or 10 days a second crop of them will appear. These must also be\r\npromptly removed, and then the third crop will show itself, which must\r\nbe similarly treated. The longer they are permitted to remain on the\r\nplant, the more they retard its development, and delay its maturity.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER III.\r\n                                CURING.\r\n\r\n\r\nGrowing tobacco is only half the battle. Having raised a crop to a state\r\nof perfection, the next object is to cure it for the market. This branch\r\nof the business demands fully as much care and skill as the purely\r\nagricultural part preceding it, and is perhaps equally influenced by the\r\nweather. The best crop ever grown may be completely spoiled by\r\ninjudicious conduct during the drying, &c., while a growth of moderate\r\nquality may be made the most of by extra care and trouble.\r\n\r\n_Harvesting._—The leaf being matured, it should be harvested only after\r\nthe dew is off the plants, and not on a rainy day. There are two modes\r\nof harvesting—gathering the leaves singly, and cutting down the whole\r\nplant. Gathering single leaves admits of removing them from the plant as\r\nthey ripen; the bottom leaves are removed first, and the top ones are\r\nleft some time longer, until they have attained full maturity. The\r\ncultivator is thereby enabled to gather his crop when it possesses the\r\ngreatest value. This plan necessitates, however, a great amount of\r\nlabour, and, in a hot climate, the single leaves are apt to dry so\r\nrapidly as not to attain a proper colour, unless stacked early in heaps.\r\nBut stacking in heaps involves great risk of the leaves heating too\r\nmuch, and developing a bad flavour, whereby the tobacco loses more or\r\nless in value. For Indian circumstances generally, cutting the whole\r\nplants is better than gathering the leaves singly.\r\n\r\nFor cutting down the plants, a long knife or chopper is used. A man\r\ntakes the plant with his left hand about 9 inches from the ground, and\r\nwith the knife in his right hand, cuts through the stem of the plant\r\njust above the ground. If the plants are sufficiently “wilted,” he may\r\nlay them on the ground and proceed to cut down others; if, however, they\r\nare so brittle as to cause the leaves to be injured by laying them down,\r\nhe should give them to another person, to carry them at once under\r\nshade. During bright weather, the plants should not be allowed to lie\r\nexposed to the sun on the ground, or they will become sun-burnt, and\r\nlose in value. A temporary shed should be erected; it might be simply a\r\nlight roof of palm-leaves or thatched straw, supported by poles; a large\r\ntree standing near will also serve the purpose. Under this shade,\r\nparallel rows of posts are put up, and on the posts, light poles or\r\nstrong bamboos are fixed horizontally. The parallel lines should be\r\nabout 4½ feet apart and the horizontal poles about 4–5 feet from the\r\nground, according to the height of the tobacco plants. Rods are cut in\r\nlengths of 5 feet, and laid over the parallel bars, so that they will\r\nproject about 3 inches at each end. A very light and convenient shelter\r\nsometimes used for sun-drying in America, consists of rods laid\r\ncrosswise, supported on four upright poles, and covered with a sloping\r\nroof of boards. The plants that have been cut are immediately brought\r\ninto the shade, tied in pairs, and hung across the rods. They must not\r\nbe hung so close as to press each other, and the rods should therefore\r\nbe 6–12 inches apart. The framework should be so large as to allow of\r\none day’s cutting being hung. The plants are left thus for one day,\r\nduring which time they will be wilted sufficiently to allow handling\r\nwithout tearing the leaves. In a very dry wind, mats or other cover\r\nshould be laid against the plants most exposed to it, or their leaves\r\nwill dry rapidly, shrivel up, and remain green. Next day the leaves are\r\ncarted to the drying-shed. A cart supplied with a framework, in order\r\nthat the plants may be hung as they were hung under the shade, is the\r\nbest means. Perpendicular uprights at each corner of a cart or waggon\r\nare fixed together by horizontal poles. The plants may be hung so close\r\nas not to press heavily on each other, 200–400 being brought to the shed\r\nat one time.\r\n\r\nAs a general rule, Judson Popenoe thinks “tobacco should be cut in about\r\n2 weeks from topping, at which time the leaves assume a spotted\r\nappearance and appear to have fulled up thicker; double up the leaf and\r\npress it together with thumb and finger, and, if ready to cut, the leaf\r\nwhere pressed will break crisp and short. Do not let your tobacco get\r\nover-ripe, or it will cure up yellow and spotted: it is better to cut\r\ntoo soon than too late. Take a hatchet or short corn-knife, grasp the\r\nstalk with the left hand, bend it well to the left, so as to expose the\r\nlower part of the stalk, strike with the knife just at the surface of\r\nthe ground, let the stalk drop over on the ground without doubling the\r\nleaves under, and leave it to wilt. The usual practice is to worm and\r\nsucker while the dew is on in the morning, and as soon as the dew is off\r\nto commence cutting. There are some who advocate cutting in the\r\nafternoon, say 3 o’clock; let it wilt and lie out until the dew is off\r\nnext day, and take it in before the sun gets hot enough to burn it. I\r\nprefer the first plan, because a heavy dew may fall on the tobacco, and\r\nnext day be cloudy, leaving the tobacco wet and unpleasant to handle.\r\nAfter cutting, allow the tobacco to wilt long enough to make the leaves\r\ntough, so that they can be handled without tearing. Great care is now\r\nnecessary to keep the tobacco from sun-burning; cutting should be\r\ncommenced as soon as the dew is off, and all that is cut should be\r\nhoused by 11 o’clock, unless it is cloudy; from 11 to 2 o’clock the\r\ndirect rays of the sun on the tobacco, after it is cut, will burn the\r\nleaves in 20 minutes; after 2 P. M., as a general thing, there is no\r\ndanger of such burning, the sun’s rays not striking direct on the\r\ntobacco. Have a waggon at hand, with stiff boards, 12 feet long, laid on\r\nthe running gears; as soon as the tobacco is wilted so that it can be\r\nhandled without breaking, commence loading on both sides of the waggon\r\non the front end, lapping the tobacco the same as loading fodder,\r\nkeeping the butts out on both sides—build about 2 feet high, and so on\r\nuntil loaded.”\r\n\r\nAny one accustomed to the cultivation of the crop, says Bishop, “knows\r\nwhen it is ripe,—the veins of the leaves are swollen, the leaves begin\r\nto look spotted and feel thick and gummy. The ends of the leaves will\r\ncrack on being doubled up. After it is ripe, the sooner it is cut the\r\nbetter, as it is liable to injury by frost or hail, and will not\r\nincrease in weight as fast as the worms eat it, and the leaves get\r\nbroken by catching them. The plants will generally ripen from the 1st to\r\nthe 15th of September; they should not be cut immediately after a heavy\r\nrain unless in danger of frost, as a portion of the gum washes out, but\r\nshould be allowed to stand 2–3 days. The cutting should not begin until\r\nthe dew is off; a cloudy day is best, for when the sun shines hot, they\r\nwill not have time to wilt sufficiently before they will sunburn, which\r\nmay be known by the leaves turning white and looking puckered. Commence\r\non one side of the piece, laying the plants all one way, in order to\r\nfacilitate loading. The plants may, most of them, be broken off easily,\r\nby gently bending them over one way and another. Small plants, which\r\nwill not break, may be sawed off with an old saw or cut with a hatchet.\r\nIf the sun shines too hot, the plants should be turned over carefully to\r\nprevent burning. After lying an hour or two to wilt sufficiently, so as\r\nnot to break by handling, they may be carted to the barn.”\r\n\r\nIn the words of Schneider, “when the plant begins to yellow, it is time\r\nto put it away. It is cut off close to the ground, by turning up the\r\nbottom leaves and striking with a tobacco-knife, formed of an old\r\nscythe—such knives as are often used for cutting corn. Let it lie on the\r\nground for a short time to wilt, and then carry it to the tobacco-house,\r\nwhen it may be put away in three different modes, by ‘pegging,’\r\n‘spearing,’ and ‘splitting.’ Pegging tobacco is the neatest way and\r\nbest, yet the slowest. It is done by driving pegs about 6 inches long\r\nand ½ inch or less square into the stalk, about 4 inches from the big\r\nend of the stalk; and these pegs are driven in with a mallet, in a\r\nslanting direction, so as to hook on to the sticks in the house. It is\r\nthen put on to a ‘horse,’ which, by a rope fixed to one corner, is\r\npulled up in the house and there hung upon the sticks, which are\r\nregulated at proper distances. A ‘tobacco-horse’ is nothing more than\r\nthree small sticks nailed together so as to form a triangle, each side\r\nbeing 3–4 feet long. Spearing is the plan I pursue; because it is neat\r\nenough and decidedly the quickest plan. A rough block, with a hole\r\nmortised in it, and a little fork a few inches from the hole for the\r\ntobacco-stick to rest upon, one end being in the hole and a spear on the\r\nother end of the stick, is all the apparatus required; the plant is\r\nthen, with both hands, run over the spear and thus strung upon the\r\nsticks, which, when full, are taken to the house and hung up at once.\r\nThere are ‘dart-spears,’ like the Indian dart, and ‘round spears.’\r\nEither will do. ‘Splitting’ tobacco is admired by many, who contend that\r\nit cures brighter, quicker, and is less likely to ‘house-burn’ or injure\r\nfrom too thick hanging. This mode is pursued easily by simply splitting,\r\nwith a knife made for the purpose, the plant from the top to within a\r\nfew inches of the bottom, before it is cut down for housing.”\r\n\r\nAnother planter observes that “when a plant begins to ripen, it will\r\ngradually assume a ‘piebald’ or spotted appearance. As the ripening\r\nadvances, the spots will become more distinct and individualized. When\r\nthe spots can be distinguished at the distance of 10 steps, and the\r\nleaves of the plant turn down, become stiff to the touch, and their ends\r\ncurl under, the plant is ripe, and should be cut. From the moment it has\r\narrived at maturity, it begins to decay. Remember that all the plants in\r\nyour crop are to be hung after they are cut—hung on something, and by\r\nsomething. Prepare a knife—a butcher-knife answers well—have it\r\nsharp—enter it at the top of the plant, where the top was broken off.\r\nEnter it centrally; press it downwards, dividing the stalk into two\r\nequal portions. Continue it downwards till within 5 inches of the\r\nground. Withdraw the knife, and cut off the stalk close to the ground.\r\nThe plant is now cut. Lay it on the ground with the lower end towards\r\nthe sun. The plants should be placed in rows as they are cut, in order\r\nto facilitate the labour of gathering them. There is one caution to be\r\nheeded in cutting tobacco, and that is, do not let it be burnt or\r\nblistered by the heat of the sun. In some varieties of tobacco this will\r\nbe effected in one hour; in others, not so soon. But this danger can be\r\nevaded in two ways: first, by cutting late in the evening; second, by\r\nthrowing it in the shade, or covering it so as to weaken the power of\r\nthe sun. Some varieties of tobacco will wilt (that is, become soft or\r\nlimber) in 2 hours; others, in a longer time, according to the degree of\r\nsun-heat.”\r\n\r\nBishop tells us that when “the plant begins to yellow or turn spotted,\r\nit is time to put it away. It is cut off close to the ground, turning up\r\nthe leaves, and cutting off close to the roots, by a single stroke of a\r\nhatchet, or tobacco-knife, made of an old scythe, such as are used in\r\ncutting up corn. After cutting, let it lie on the ground a short time to\r\nwilt, when it may be handled without danger of tearing the leaves; it is\r\nthen to be taken to the house to be ‘hung.’”\r\n\r\nThe condition of the leaf, according to Pursley, may be judged in the\r\nfollowing manner:—“When the tobacco is ripe, it has a yellow faded\r\ncolour, and becomes brittle; the surface of the leaf is rough and\r\nridged. By bending the leaf short between the fingers, it will break\r\nbefore it will double. The sticks to hang it on should be in readiness.\r\nThe best mode of hanging or stringing is with a V-shaped spear, made of\r\niron or steel. The spear has a socket, large to admit the end of the\r\nstick. The sticks should be sharpened at one end, to fit the socket;\r\nshould be 4 feet 6 inches in length, 2 inches wide, and 1 inch thick. A\r\nstick of these dimensions will hold 8 plants. The tobacco should be cut\r\noff just below the bottom leaf, then turn the plant upside down, and let\r\nit remain so till the sun wilts it. When it is wilted it can be handled\r\nwithout breaking; then it should be taken up and laid in piles of 8\r\nstalks each, placing the butts of the stalks towards the sun, to prevent\r\nit from sun-burning. When it is sun-burnt it turns black, and it cannot\r\nbe cured any other colour than black, which ruins its sale. The sticks\r\nshould be strewed along, one stick to a pile; place the spear on the end\r\nof the stick, and set the stick upright; then take up the tobacco, one\r\nstalk at a time, and thrust it on the stick, letting the spear pass\r\nthrough the stalk, about 6 inches from the butt end; then take the spear\r\noff and take up the stick, and shake the tobacco out straight, and set\r\nthe stick up with the butts towards the sun.”\r\n\r\nSome tobacco-growers, remarks Pursley, “prefer splitting the stalk from\r\nthe top down to within about 6 inches of the butt, then hang it on the\r\nsticks. But I cannot agree with them, for it is more difficult to\r\nhandle, and is apt to slip off the stick, when moving it; besides, the\r\ntobacco cured in this manner is not so heavy as if it was speared. It\r\ndries out quicker by being split, but the substance evaporates instead\r\nof remaining in the leaf. I am not certain that it injures the taste of\r\nthe tobacco, but I am certain that split tobacco is lighter than that\r\nwhich is speared. Some prefer hanging the tobacco on scaffolds in the\r\nfield until it is ready to be put in the barn and cured by fire. But it\r\nis the safest to house it as soon as it is strung on the sticks.\r\nScaffolding is done by placing poles on forks, about 4 feet apart, and\r\n4–5 feet from the ground; then hang the tobacco between the poles,\r\nletting the ends of the sticks rest on the poles. This procedure is\r\nunsafe, for the rain may come and saturate the tobacco and wash off the\r\ngum, thus making it light and chaffy.”\r\n\r\nThe maturity of tobacco is defined by Schneider as when the leaves,\r\nwhich have hitherto been green, on holding them “against the sun, show\r\nyellowish, reddish, or brownish spots, feel sticky, and when bent break\r\noff short and clean. Before this period sets in, the _drying-house_\r\nshould be in good order. This house is built to give room for the free\r\nhanging up of the tobacco, so that it is protected from the sun, wind,\r\nand rain, and is allowed to dry by the free circulation of the air. Any\r\nbuilding, therefore, will answer which has a good roof, boarded sides,\r\nand enough windows and air-holes (which can be closed at will) to keep\r\nup a mild circulation of air inside, and also to keep out strong and too\r\nquick drying winds. If the tobacco is grown on a large scale, the house\r\nshould have large doorways to drive a waggon in and out. There must be\r\nsticks all over the house, either cross or lengthwise, and these sticks\r\nmust be ready and in their places. Now the work of harvesting the crop\r\nis commenced on a clear or cloudy but not rainy day. The mature plants\r\n(those not ripe are left longer on the field if not too late in the\r\nseason) are cut off near the ground, two of them tied together by the\r\nbutt-ends and hung up in the field on riders, which rest on two forks\r\nfastened in the ground, and they are left there until evening to wilt;\r\nthen they are brought to the drying-house and hung up. The tobacco is\r\nhung up on the upper sticks first, and the work continued downward; care\r\nis taken that the sticks are 6–8 inches apart, also that the plants are\r\nnot too near together on the sticks, because the air should have free\r\npassage among the plants, and when they touch or rub against each other,\r\nunsightly spots are produced. The sticks must be pretty wide, so that\r\nthe two plants which are tied together, and one of which hangs on each\r\nside, are held well apart. Later, when the tobacco has dried off\r\nsomewhat, the sticks and plants may be moved a little nearer to each\r\nother; but the plants on the upper sticks must not touch those on the\r\nlower; they should be so arranged that one lower stick is just in the\r\nmiddle of the space between two upper ones.”\r\n\r\nAnother method of harvesting is recommended by Schneider for those “who\r\ncultivate tobacco on a small scale, or who have hands and time enough.\r\nAs all the leaves on the plant do not ripen at the same time, but the\r\nunder leaves are always a little earlier than the upper ones, they may\r\ngather the crop in the leaf, that is, taking only the matured leaves\r\nfrom the stalk; this must be done daily, and so long as there are leaves\r\non the stalk. In this way the crop will be harvested slower, and it will\r\ncost more, but the tobacco will be of more even quality and better. The\r\nleaves are strung on strings instead of being hung up on sticks, with\r\nthe same care and precautions as recommended for hanging up the whole\r\nplants. After the leaves are off, the stalks must be cut off or pulled\r\nup, for they would still vegetate, and needlessly take away nourishment\r\nfrom the soil. No more tobacco, leaves or plants should be cut than can\r\nbe taken to the drying-house and hung up the same day.”\r\n\r\nPerry Hull’s instructions commence with a caution that the plant should\r\nnever be cut while the dew is on the leaves; “but wait until it is off,\r\nsay 10 o’clock, and what tobacco is cut from that time until 2 o’clock,\r\nif the day is hot, will need close attention. In short, the whole\r\noperation, from cutting in the field, to the hanging upon the poles in\r\nthe barn, needs care, as a little carelessness or inattention will\r\ndamage many dollars’ worth. No hand should be allowed to handle it, who\r\nis unwilling to use care, and perform every operation just as directed,\r\nor else by breaking of leaves, or sticking fingers through them, &c., he\r\nmay do more damage than his wages amount to. The plant to be cut should\r\nbe taken by the left hand, not carelessly by the leaves, but carefully\r\nby the stalk, and as carefully leaned over, to give a chance to use the\r\naxe, which should have a handle about one foot long. Cut the plant with\r\none blow, laying it carefully down, with the top to the sun; if it is\r\nlaid otherwise, the leaf will burn before the main stalk of the leaf\r\nwill wilt sufficiently to admit of handling. Even in that position, it\r\nmay burn unless attended to, but not as soon. After lying until pretty\r\nwell wilted, and before burning, turn it over and wilt the other side.\r\nWhen so wilted that the main stem has lost most of its brittleness, load\r\nas explained above; taking hold of the butt of the stalk, lay them\r\ncarefully upon the arm, and again as carefully upon the load. If the day\r\nbe very hot, use expedition in getting to the shed, else, if the\r\ndistance be great, the load may heat, which will spoil the leaves for\r\nanything but fillers.”\r\n\r\nWhen the plants are carried into the shed, “if quite warm, they should\r\nbe left only one plant deep upon the floor and scaffolds. If the day be\r\ncool, and they are to be hung up soon, they may lie much thicker. They\r\nshould never be hung upon a pole less than 5 inches in width. If sawed\r\npieces are used, saw them just that; if poles are used, see that they\r\nare about that; for if anything of less width is used, the plants will\r\nhang so close, that the chances of ‘pole-burn’ are greatly increased.\r\nThey are fastened to the pole by a half hitch. (Their position is\r\nrepresented by Fig. 9 on p. 95.) It requires two hands to hang them, one\r\nto hand them, another to tie them. The poles should be about 18 inches\r\napart, and the number hung upon a 12-foot pole will depend upon the\r\nsize, from 24 to 30, so regulating them, that when thoroughly wilted,\r\nthey will scarcely touch each other. If hung thicker than this, a little\r\nunfavourable weather will cause more or less pole-burn, sweat and mould.\r\nAfter the tobacco is hung, the building should be so thoroughly\r\nventilated that there will be a circulation of air through every part.\r\nThe ventilators should be kept open during all fair weather, until well\r\ncured down. During storms, shut the doors and exclude as much wet as\r\npossible; being cautious to give it a thorough ventilation again, as\r\nsoon as the rain ceases. When it is cured enough to be husky in dry\r\nweather, exclude all hard winds, that will crack and damage the leaves.\r\nWhen the leaves are so much cured, that there is nothing about them\r\ngreen but the stem, a moderate quantity of wet weather will not injure\r\nit, but rather improve the colour; as the sap of the stalk works through\r\nthe stems into the leaves, during moist weather until the stalk has been\r\nwell frozen; after this takes place, the tobacco should be picked.”\r\n\r\nWhite estimates that in “the course of 2 or 3 weeks after topping, the\r\nplants will begin to ripen, which may be known by the change in colour\r\nof the leaf. It will look spotted with spots of lighter green, a\r\nyellowish green. When fully ripe the leaf may be folded together, and\r\nmoderately pressed without breaking or cracking. Now is the time to\r\nbegin to harvest it. All this is supposed to take place before there is\r\nany appearance of frost, as a very light frost often does great damage.\r\nAll touched by it is ruined, and good for nothing. The crop must be cut\r\nand hung, even if not fully ripe, before any frosts occur. If there are\r\nstrong appearances of a frost, you can secure the crop by cutting it\r\ndown, and putting it either under your sheds, or by putting it in piles,\r\nnot over 1 foot deep, in the field, and covering with straw. It is well\r\nto let it stand, if not fully ripe, as long as it can safely, for the\r\ncool nights have a tendency to thicken up the leaves. The cutting is\r\nbest performed with a hay-knife, with a sharp, rounding point, in the\r\nfollowing way: stand at the right-hand side of the plant or row; with\r\nthe left hand grasp the stalk down 2 or 3 leaves from the top and lean\r\nit back on the row; now, with the point of your cutter held in the right\r\nhand 2–3 inches from the stalk, close to the root under the bottom leaf,\r\nwith a sudden stroke or dab, sever the same from the root; lay it gently\r\ndown back in a line with the row. Proceed in like manner to cut what you\r\ncan take care of, and not get injured by sunburn. Have two rows of butts\r\ntogether, lying the same way for after-convenience. This cutting is done\r\nafter the dew is off in the morning, or in the afternoon. Let it remain\r\nuntil the top side is somewhat wilted; then commence to turn it over.\r\nStep between the two rows with the butts lying toward you, and with each\r\nhand take a plant on either side; raise them from the ground, and by\r\ntwisting the hands in or out, turn the plants, laying them either to the\r\nright or left, as most convenient, at right angles to their former\r\nposition. Go through with the 2 rows, and you have the next 2 with the\r\nbutts the other way; take these and lay the tips directly opposite those\r\nfirst turned, and you have an alley, with the butts of the plants of two\r\nrows on either side, which will be convenient to drive in to load. When\r\nwilted sufficient to be handled without breaking, if in the forenoon,\r\nyou can load it from the rows as they lie; if in the afternoon, it is\r\nbest to put in hakes, which is done by putting five plants at the\r\nbottom, and on these four, decreasing one on each layer, and terminating\r\nwith one on the top; this will protect it from dew and wet. The best\r\ncart for hauling the tobacco is a one-horse waggon, geared long, with\r\nmerely a platform resting on the axles. Such a cart can be driven\r\nbetween the rows and loaded from either side, having the butts of the\r\nplants uniformly one way, and laid crosswise on the platform. Great care\r\nshould be used, in all the handling, not to bruise, break, or tear the\r\nleaves. Having cut all, excepting your seed-plants, strip all the leaves\r\nfrom these, and set a stake to each to tie it up to; let the stake be a\r\nfoot taller than the plant; it will answer to keep a piece of old carpet\r\nfrom breaking down the stalk when you wish to cover it up on cold\r\nnights. Let the seed-plants stand till the pods or bolls are cured to a\r\nbrown, and the seed is ripe; then cut off the top of the seed-stalk, and\r\nhang it up in some dry and safe place, where it will be ready to shell\r\nand use the next season; only the ripest and best pods should be used.”\r\n\r\nLibhart alludes to the existence of several ways of hanging cut tobacco\r\nplants, but specifies the two following as the best and shortest:\r\n“first, splitting and hanging it upon laths or poles and leaving it to\r\npartially cure in the field; secondly, nailing it to rails with\r\nlathing-nails, at once in the shed. The former method, for high northern\r\nlatitudes, is by far the best, as it will cure in a much shorter time\r\n(and thus prevent the destruction of the crop by freezing in the shed),\r\nby the drying of the pith of the stalk, which is the main reservoir of\r\nmoisture. It is performed as follows:—Have a chisel about 1 foot long\r\nand 3 inches broad, the sharp end not bevelled on one side, but coming\r\nto an edge by a gradual taper on both sides (a common tenon-saw will do\r\npretty well); place the edge of the chisel in the centre of the stalk\r\nupon the end where it has been topped, and push it down, guiding it in\r\nits course so as not to break or cut off any leaves, to within 3–4\r\ninches of the ground; the stalk may then be cut off with a hatchet, or\r\nwith the chisel if it be made pretty strong. The splitting may be done\r\nin the morning when the leaves are too brittle to admit of the stalk\r\nbeing cut down, and then when the sun has sufficiently wilted the\r\nleaves, the stalk may be cut and left to lie until it will bear handling\r\nwithout breaking the leaves. The lath being previously prepared, 4 feet\r\nin length and about 1 inch in thickness on one edge, and ½ inch on the\r\nother, and 2 inches broad (or poles cut in the forest will answer pretty\r\nwell); then have trestles prepared high enough to allow the stalks to\r\nhang suspended without touching the ground, and set far enough apart in\r\nthe field to admit of the lath reaching from one to another; now place\r\nthe stalks of tobacco upon the lath (previously laid across the\r\ntrestles), by slipping them over and down until they will hang\r\nperpendicular and 6–8 inches apart, so they will merely touch, without\r\ncrowding too much. It may be left hanging thus exposed to the weather\r\nuntil the leaves are so wilted that the stalks hang apart without\r\ntouching, and the lower leaves begin to dry, when it is taken off the\r\ntrestles, each lath entire, and laid upon a waggon and hauled to the\r\ndrying-shed.”\r\n\r\nBefore the tobacco is ready for harvesting, Hudson suggests the\r\npreparation of “a supply of sticks for hanging. Sticks 4 feet long and 1\r\ninch square are most convenient; 12 sticks to every 100 plants will be\r\nsufficient. For sun-curing, there should be a shed built at one or more\r\nconvenient points of the patch. This may be done by placing posts in the\r\nground to support the poles, as represented in Fig. 8. The poles _a_\r\nbeing for the support of the smaller poles _c_, upon which the\r\ntobacco-sticks are placed, and _b_ for the cover, when necessary that it\r\nshould be shedded.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 8.]\r\n\r\nMitjen’s translator gives the following account of the Cuban practice.\r\n“Tobacco should be cut during the wane of the moon; and although most\r\n_vegueros_ say that it is impossible to do this, because the leaves\r\ncommence to ripen both during the new and the full moon, and would be\r\nover-ripe before its wane, we can, nevertheless, assert that we know\r\npersons who never cut their tobacco during the first quarter, or when\r\nrain has made it again green. These persons have never experienced any\r\ndifficulty; rather, on the contrary, they are those who always obtain\r\nthe best prices and the greatest money results. Cutting tobacco during\r\nthe first quarter of the moon, or when vegetation is renewed in the\r\nleaf, is one of the principal reasons why the leaf becomes pricked with\r\nholes, and this very frequently even before it is taken from the\r\nplantation to the market. The system generally observed is, in cutting\r\ntobacco, to take off, at once, all those parts of the plants which may\r\nbe really or apparently ripe, and to load up the poles indiscriminately,\r\nwithout any division between the pairs of leaves (_mancuernas_). This\r\nsystem is highly prejudicial. The leaves of the same plant are not all\r\nof the same quality, neither do they all at the same time acquire the\r\nsame degree of ripeness. Those of the crown, or the pairs at the top of\r\nthe plant, immediately next the flower or seed, receive the sun direct\r\non their upper surface, and are the first to ripen, whereas the lower\r\nones, being shaded by the upper ones, remain still in an unripe state;\r\nmoreover, the lower leaves at the foot of the plant, and even those of\r\nthe fifth or fourth pairs (_mancuernas_), compared with those of the\r\nfirst, second, and third pairs, are inferior in quality, and,\r\ncomparatively speaking, may be termed leaves without substance. The\r\ncontact of these leaves with the upper ones frequently occasions putrid\r\nfermentation on the poles (_cujes_) and in the packs (this is vulgarly\r\ncalled _sahorno_), especially if there is much dampness in the\r\natmosphere. When this misfortune happens in a tobacco curing-house all\r\nthe weak leaves will be lost, and the strong ones will be so injured\r\nthat the best quality of _capa_ would turn to _tripa_, and that of bad\r\nconsistency.\r\n\r\n“The cause of this destruction, from which the _veguero_ suffers more or\r\nless in the best of crops, may be easily explained. The curing of\r\ntobacco is nothing more than a series of fermentations. It ferments on\r\nthe poles (_cujes_), ferments in the heaps (_pilon_), and ferments in\r\nthe bales. All these fermentations are requisite for obtaining a good\r\ncolour and smell, but it is better that each quality or consistency of\r\ntobacco should ferment apart. Tobacco of good strong quality, which is\r\nthat produced by the upper leaves, naturally suffers a much stronger\r\nfermentation than the weak ones, because the former contain a larger\r\nproportion of juice; as the lower leaves have less substance, the\r\nfermentation is naturally weaker and lasts less time; but if the leaves\r\nare put in contact with those of a stronger quality, the fermentation\r\nwould be kept up by the latter, and it would indispensably result that\r\nthe weak ones would rot, and their contact be injurious to the stronger\r\nones. But by separating, in the field, the leaves of different\r\nconsistencies which each tobacco stalk produces, this evil is avoided,\r\nand the dry rot is rendered impossible, unless no care whatsoever is\r\ngiven in the curing-house. Therefore, the mode of reaping should be\r\nreformed. It is best to cut the tobacco when it is thoroughly ripe, and\r\nin the wane of the moon, making this operation in three sections or\r\ncuts, each of which should always be placed on separate poles, in\r\nseparate rooms, heaps, and carefully picked.\r\n\r\n“The first cut should consist only of the pair of crown leaves, and for\r\nthe poles which they are hung on, a special corner in the curing-house\r\nshould be set apart. After the first cutting, and 3 or 4 days of sun,\r\nthe second and third pairs of leaves will be ripe, and may be cut at one\r\nand the same time, care being taken to place them on separate poles and\r\nrooms; and, lastly, 3 or 4 days after the second cutting, the remainder\r\nof the leaves may be gathered, but the last leaf near the ground should\r\nnot be taken, as it has no consistency, and therefore no value as\r\ntobacco, and only serves to increase the work and give discredit to the\r\nclass of tobacco.\r\n\r\n“Tobacco should be cut during the hottest part of the day; each pair of\r\nleaves should be placed on the ground face downwards, so that the sun\r\nmay strike on the under part of the leaf, and in this state it should be\r\nallowed to remain a sufficient length of time to wither, after which the\r\npairs of leaves (_mancuernas_) should be picked up one by one, placed\r\nevenly on the arm, with the upper side of the leaf inwards, and each\r\narmful should be carried to and placed on the poles (_cujes_), which\r\nshould be prepared beforehand near the spot where the tobacco is being\r\ncut. Two forked sticks should be placed strongly in the ground, and on\r\nthese the pole should rest. After the tobacco leaves have been placed\r\ncarefully on these poles and been allowed to wither, they should be\r\ncarried to the curing-house before the sun has time to dry them. This\r\noperation must be performed by two labourers, who can carry each time\r\ntwo poles, placing the end of each on either shoulder, so that, in\r\nwalking, the leaves on one pole may not cut against those on the other.\r\nThese poles of leaves, when brought to the curing-house, should be fixed\r\nor hung by the points on the lowest stages, but so high that the points\r\nof the leaves do not touch the ground, and sufficiently apart one from\r\nthe other that the leaves may not touch, because, being brought in from\r\nthe field warmed by the sun, it is not judicious to allow them to touch.\r\nWhen the sun is not sufficiently strong to wither the cut leaves,\r\nreaping should not be continued. The tobacco should be so arranged on\r\nthe poles that the pieces of stalk should gently touch one with the\r\nother, but without crowding.” However, if the weather should be damp,\r\nand the leaves large, space should be left between the pairs.\r\n\r\n_Drying._—The drying-shed is prepared beforehand to receive the tobacco.\r\nWhen cultivating tobacco on a small scale, any shed will do, provided\r\nthat it contains a sufficient number of doors and windows to admit of\r\nregulating the circulation of air. A roof made of straw seems to answer\r\nvery well. The shed should be high enough to admit of hanging 3 rows of\r\ntobacco in it, one above the other. The bottom tier for the first row\r\nshould be about 3–5 feet from the ground, according to the size of the\r\nplants, which should not touch the ground; the second tier should be 3–5\r\nfeet higher than the first; the third, 3–5 feet higher than the second;\r\nthe whole being 10–17 feet high from the bottom of the shed to the\r\nhighest tier. The tiers must be so arranged that the tobacco when hung\r\non the upper tier should not touch that of the lower one, and that the\r\nrods on which the tobacco has been hung in the field fit exactly. The\r\nwindows must face each other, and be placed between the tiers, so that\r\nthe bottom part of the window is on the same level as the tier. When\r\ncultivating on a large scale, the same arrangements are made, but the\r\nbuilding is higher, and is provided with a cellar, in which to place the\r\ntobacco for the purpose of stripping, &c.\r\n\r\nThe drying-shed being ready, the plants immediately on arrival at the\r\nshed are transferred from the conveyance, on the rods, to the lowest\r\ntier. No rule can be given as to the distance the rods should be placed\r\nfrom each other, as it varies according to the species of the plant, the\r\ndegree of ripeness, and especially the state of the weather. The purpose\r\nof hanging the plant here on the lower tier is to cause the leaves to\r\ndry gradually, and assume a good yellow colour, and to create a slight\r\nfermentation in them, while allowing such a circulation of air between\r\nthe plants as will facilitate the gradual escape of the moisture from\r\nthem, and prevent the injurious development of ammonia and other\r\ncombinations that give rise to bad flavour in the tobacco. How to attain\r\nthis, exercises the judgment of the cultivator, who, by frequent\r\nexamination of the plants, and by careful observation of the changes\r\ngoing on in the leaves, will soon find out the right way.\r\n\r\nThe rods should be placed closer together—(_a_) when the plants are much\r\nwilted on reaching the shed; (_b_) when the air is very dry, and the\r\ntemperature is high; (_c_) when the leaves of the plant are very thin\r\nand contain little water. Plants which have the leaves closely arranged\r\non the stems must be hung farther apart. When the air is very dry, and\r\nthere is a strong breeze, the windows must be closed. If this is not\r\nsufficient, water may be poured on some heaps of sand, to create a moist\r\natmosphere in the shed. When the stems of the plant are very thick, and\r\nconsequently contain much sap, it is beneficial to open the windows,\r\nespecially at morning and evening, for some hours, that the wind may\r\npass over the butt-ends. As the windows are situated above the lowest\r\ntier, the leaves will not be much affected by it.\r\n\r\nThe leaves must be examined carefully every day; one plant may progress\r\nvery well, whereas another close by may decompose too rapidly, and\r\nanother too slowly. Although no change of weather occur, it may yet be\r\nnecessary to alter the position of the rods, in order that each plant\r\nand leaf may receive air in such a degree as is most conducive to its\r\nproper decomposition. Any change in the weather necessitates different\r\narrangements. The plant should remain on the lower tier until the leaves\r\nhave turned yellow, which will take place within 6–10 days, according to\r\ncircumstances; after this, they are hung on the upper tiers. There they\r\nshould be more apart, each plant hanging free. When on the upper tiers,\r\nthe tobacco may be said to be in the free-hang; and when on the lowest\r\ntier, in the close-hang. The object in hanging the plants more apart on\r\nthe upper tier is to dry them more rapidly there, and for this purpose,\r\nthe shutters may be opened, unless there be a strong dry wind. The\r\nlight-yellow colour of the leaves should change into a dark\r\nyellow-golden or light-brown colour. After hanging on the upper tier for\r\nabout a week, the veins of the leaves will be nearly dry, leaving only\r\nthe midribs pliant. The drying of the leaf and the changing of its\r\ncolour proceed gradually, commencing from the margin and proceeding to\r\nthe midrib. At this time, the plants are hung closer together, the\r\nevaporation from the leaves being little, and the space and sticks being\r\nrequired. The plants hanging on two or three sticks may be hung on one\r\nstick. All the windows may be kept open from this time; the tobacco may\r\nalso be brought into an open shed, or even hung outside exposed to the\r\nsun. In about a week more, the midribs will be entirely dried up, and\r\nthe tobacco will be fit for stripping. In some climates, it may be\r\nnecessary to facilitate the drying by the aid of artificial heat. For\r\nthis purpose, heated air should be conducted into the drying-shed,\r\nwithout the fire, or the products of combustion, being admitted.\r\n\r\nPursley warns tobacco growers that the plant should not be exposed to\r\nthe weather after it is cut, but should “be immediately conveyed to the\r\nbarn and hung up. As soon as it gets about half yellowed, a slow fire\r\nshould be started under it; if made too hot at first, the tobacco will\r\nturn black. About the second day the ends of the leaves will begin to\r\ncurl up; then the fire should be gradually increased, till it heats the\r\ntobacco blood warm; it should be kept up so till the leaf is thoroughly\r\ncured. If this rule be strictly adhered to, the tobacco will be cured\r\nbright. The brighter it is cured the better it sells.\r\n\r\n“Our barns are generally built of logs, some have frames. The barn\r\nshould be made tight up to the tobacco, which should hang about 8 feet\r\nfrom the ground; above this leave cracks or air-holes, sufficient for\r\nfree ventilation. A barn to hold 2½ acres of tobacco, which is as much\r\nas one man can attend to, should be 24 feet square. It should have 5\r\ntiers of poles, the lowest about 6 feet from the ground; these should\r\nextend across the barn, and be fastened at each end into the walls. The\r\npoles should be 4 feet apart, and the tiers directly one above another.\r\nThe sticks which contain the tobacco should be placed within 8 inches of\r\neach other, on all the poles except the bottom ones, which should be\r\nleft vacant directly over the fire. When tobacco is nearly cured, it\r\nvery readily catches fire. If there be a wet spell of weather before the\r\nstalks are thoroughly dry, build a fire under the tobacco sufficiently\r\nhot to keep it dry. It should not get damp and pliant until the stalks\r\nare dry, then it may be allowed to get damp.”\r\n\r\nLibhart recommends that the shed “be constructed of timbers strong\r\nenough to resist storms, and boarded ‘up and down.’ About every 3 feet\r\none board should be hinged, to readily open and shut. If it is intended\r\nto split and lath the tobacco, the inside of the shed must be divided by\r\nrails into widths to accommodate the lath, and likewise into tiers, one\r\nabove the other, far enough apart to allow the stalks to hang from, well\r\nseparate. The frame of rails and timbers inside the shed destined to\r\nsustain the weight of the tiers of tobacco (which, when green, is\r\nexceedingly heavy) should be strongly constructed, so as to preclude the\r\npossibility of breaking down, for if this should happen to the upper\r\ntier, in all probability the whole would be tumbled to the ground.”\r\n\r\nThe housing of the crop proceeds, says Dennis, “as fast as it is cured\r\nup on the scaffold, or as the indications of rain make it necessary,\r\ncare being taken not to bruise or tear it in hauling. The sticks of\r\ntobacco may be piled upon the waggon or cart, and hauled to the barn and\r\nhung up, commencing in the highest part of the building, and filling up\r\nas you go downwards. If the leaves are pretty well cured, you may hang\r\nit so as to touch, without crowding it; if not, there should be a little\r\nspace between. If a cold, rainy spell comes on, you will need to\r\nintroduce some means of artificial drying. A trench is sometimes dug,\r\nand a log or two of wood placed in it, and a fire made, taking care to\r\nremove the tobacco immediately over the fire, and avoiding much blaze.\r\nThis is dangerous, and a better plan is to make a trench across the\r\nfloor of the barn, of mason-work, covered with sheet-iron, and leading\r\nfrom a furnace outside the house on one side, to a chimney at a safe\r\ndistance on the other. The colour and quality of tobacco may be improved\r\nby hanging it closely and curing by artificial heat, watching that it\r\ndoes not become ‘funked,’ or moulded, while curing; but the best plan\r\nfor a beginner is to dry it safely, and make a sure crop, experimenting\r\nas he goes along, in order to improve the quality, as he may safely do\r\nso. When the stalk becomes dry and entirely cured, which will not\r\nusually be for some weeks, the crop is ready to ‘strip.’ The hanging\r\ntobacco yields to the influence of a rainy day or a foggy morning, and\r\n‘comes in case,’ or softens, so it will not crumble. It must never be\r\nhandled when dry. When it is just soft, not damp, or when it is barely\r\nso soft that it can be handled (if it is approaching that softened\r\nstate), it may be taken down and taken off the sticks, and ‘bulked,’ by\r\npiling it alongside a partition, or by itself, with the butts of the\r\nstalks outward in every direction, and the tops or leaves in the centre.\r\nSeveral hundred pounds may be thus bulked down, and can be worked up\r\nwhile the hanging tobacco has gone out of case, and cannot be touched.”\r\n\r\nAccording to Bishop, it usually requires about 12 weeks to cure the\r\nplants thoroughly, that is, so that there is no more juice in the leaves\r\nor leaf-stems; it matters not if the main stalk is not dry, you need not\r\nexpect it, and there will be green leaves that will not cure but freeze\r\nwhile green and are worthless. He calculates that to “hang an acre of\r\ngood tobacco requires a building about 30 by 24 feet with 15-feet posts.\r\nTwo girths should be framed into the posts on all sides of the building;\r\none 5 feet above the sill, and the other 10 feet above, to rest the\r\npoles on, also to nail the covering boards to. This gives a space of 5\r\nfeet for each tier of plants. Have a beam run across the centre of the\r\nbuilding, with a post in the middle with girths to correspond with those\r\non the side, extending lengthwise through the middle of the building for\r\nthe poles or rails, each 12 feet in length, to be laid upon; or if\r\nsticks are to be used (as hereafter described) lay rails or poles once\r\nin 4 feet for the sticks to rest upon. Place a ventilator upon the\r\ncentre of the roof, and have one board in every 4 feet hung on hinges,\r\nto be opened or closed at pleasure. If made with a floor and a cellar\r\nunderneath, to let down the tobacco into when ready stripped, it is all\r\nthe better. We will now return to the crop, and commence hanging it. A\r\ncommon way of doing it is by tying with common twine. Tie the end of the\r\nstring tightly around the butt of one plant, and by placing it against\r\nthe side of the pole nearest you, put another plant on the opposite side\r\nand carry the string over and around it, placing the plants alternately\r\non each side of the pole until filled, then fasten the string, place the\r\npole in the right place (it should be nearly right before it is filled),\r\nand commence on the next one in like manner, having some one to hand the\r\nplants as wanted. As to how thick to hang it depends upon the size of\r\nthe plants, but in good-sized tobacco about 9 inches on each side is\r\nclose enough, that will be from 30–32 on each pole of 12 feet; place the\r\npoles 15–18 inches apart. Another method of hanging, much practised and\r\napproved by many, is to hang on slats or sticks sawed out 4 feet long,\r\n1¼ inches wide, and ⅝ inch thick. Chestnut timber is generally used\r\nhere. The common lath answers very well for this purpose. An iron made\r\nsomething like a chisel is used to slip on to one end of the sticks,\r\nwhich are sharpened a little at one end to receive it. It is made about\r\n8 inches long, wedge-shaped at the small end, and a socket ½ inch by 1\r\ninch to slip on to the sticks. When ready for use have a place fixed\r\nnear where you unload, to hold one of these sticks out at right angles\r\nfrom a post and about 4 feet from the ground. Let the plants be handed\r\nyou from the load and slip them on the stick, piercing the stalk about 6\r\ninches from the butt; put 6 or 7 plants of medium size on each stick,\r\nthicker if smaller; when hung it will appear as in Fig. 9. As each stick\r\nis filled, it may be carried to its place in the barn. In getting them\r\nto the top of the barn, they may be handed up with a pitchfork, lifting\r\nthem by the middle of the sticks. These sticks should be about 8 inches\r\napart. I think a greater amount can be put into a given space by this\r\nmethod without danger of sweating, as it is more evenly distributed. The\r\nloose leaves that have been broken off while handling, may be cured by\r\nplacing 4 or 5 together and securing to a small pole, in the same way as\r\nplants are hung with twine.”\r\n\r\nHanging is done in the following manner:—“The ‘hanger’ stands in an\r\nerect position, having for a foothold the poles on the tier below the\r\none which he is hanging; he has a ball of tobacco-twine (a twine made of\r\nflax, procurable at any seed-store) which for convenience is carried in\r\nthe bosom of the loose blouse generally worn; he stands with the left\r\nside to the pole on which the tobacco is to be hung, left arm over it;\r\nthe stalk of tobacco is handed to him by a boy whose duty it is to pass\r\nit to him; the stalk is then taken in the left hand and placed against\r\nthe side of the pole, the butt projecting an inch or two, around which\r\nprojection the twine is wound from left to right (the twine having\r\npreviously been fastened to the pole); the next stalk is placed on the\r\nother side of the pole, just far enough along so that the leaves of the\r\ntwo stalks will not touch and ‘pole-burn,’ and so continue, the stalks\r\nbeing hung alternately on the sides of the pole, as seen in Fig. 9.\r\nAfter the house is filled, some put fires under the crop to hasten its\r\ndrying; but it is found by experience that the practice is not a good\r\none.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 9.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 10.\r\n               TOBACCO-HOUSE.]\r\n\r\nBishop describes the common size of tobacco-house as about 100 feet long\r\nby 24 feet wide, posts 17 feet long, and built upon a wall 18 inches\r\nhigh; the buildings are framed with girths from bent to bent, for\r\nboarding up and down, the bents being 12 feet apart. The external\r\nappearance is illustrated in Fig. 10. “The boards for closing up the\r\nbuilding should be 1 foot wide, and at intervals of about 5 feet a board\r\nshould be hung with light strap hinges, to serve as a ventilator to\r\nadmit light and dry air, and to exclude damp. These ventilators or doors\r\nmust be closed on frosty nights, but in fair dry weather should remain\r\nopen. The tobacco poles, the ends of which rest upon the bents, should\r\nbe about 13 feet long, 2 inches thick by 6 inches wide, of some light\r\ntimber, such as elm or basswood, and when hung with tobacco should be\r\n8–10 inches apart. A large door should be placed at either end for\r\ningress and egress. The poles, of which there should be 4 tiers, are\r\nlaid from bent to bent, resting the ends of the cross beams in the bent,\r\ntiers 4 feet 4 inches apart.” A sectional view of the barn is shown in\r\nFig. 11.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 11.]\r\n\r\nWhite suggests that stables, sheds, and barn floors can be arranged “so\r\nas to hang up an acre or two by setting stanchions with holes mortised\r\nin them to hold rests for your poles about 4½ feet apart. Set such ones\r\non either side with a very stout rail, one end in either post. Set these\r\nas often as you may need them, depending on the length of your poles. No\r\npoles should be so long as to sag very much when filled with plants. But\r\nfor another reason I would build a house expressly for hanging and\r\nstoring tobacco. Make it of good, liberal dimensions, 30 feet wide, by\r\n40 or more in length; posts, 14 feet, with two tiers of girths for poles\r\nto rest on; one tier can hang on the beams, and another above on the\r\npurlin plates, thus hanging 4 tiers under the same roof. Ventilate by a\r\nventilator in the roof, also by hanging every other board of the siding\r\non hinges. For such a building, I would have a tight floor to the whole,\r\nand underneath a good walled cellar lighted with suitable windows, and\r\nchimney in one corner, with a stove, to keep fire in in very cold\r\nweather, to work by when stripping the tobacco. For poles to hang on, I\r\nwould get, if possible, straight, slim, white pine staddles about 4–5\r\ninches in diameter; shave the bark off smooth, and we have poles that\r\nwill last and remain straight a lifetime, if kept housed.\r\n\r\n“Having provided all required, even to the strong cotton or hemp twine\r\nfor tying up the tobacco, have a good man to hand it to you. Commence by\r\ntying the end of your twine around the butt of a plant, about 2 inches\r\nfrom the end, in a slip or loose knot; place this plant at one side of\r\nthe pole near the end, your hand carrying the twine over the pole; on\r\nthe opposite side of the pole, about 6 inches along, place another\r\nplant, and with a single turn of the twine around it from before, round\r\nback, and by drawing it close, the plant is secure. Proceed thus till\r\nyou have filled your pole; then with a knife, cut a notch in the pole\r\nand draw your twine through, and it is fast. You can now cut it off and\r\ncommence another pole. Place the poles far enough apart to prevent the\r\ntobacco crowding; about 1 foot will do. In this manner you will have a\r\nrow of plants hanging on each side of the pole about 1 foot apart. The\r\nman, in handing up, should take the plant by the butt, carefully from\r\nthe pile or load, raise it up and gently shake it sideways, to shake off\r\ndirt and loosen the leaves when stuck together, and also adhering to the\r\nstalk; with the other hand, take hold about midways of the stalk and\r\npass to the one tying up, enabling him to receive the plant in such a\r\nway as to not need to shift it in his hand, but to place it immediately\r\ninto its position beside the pole. All leaves which are accidentally or\r\notherwise broken from the plants, should be gathered up each day, and\r\nhung three or four in a bunch, the same way as the plants, or string\r\nthem on a string; the latter is the best way—with a large needle-thread,\r\na suitable cord, and on to this string the leaves one at a time, by\r\nrunning the needle through near the end of the stem. These can be hung\r\nby attaching the two ends to some suitable nail, and having it remain\r\nstretched. In this way they will cure very well.\r\n\r\n“Having housed the whole of your crop, give it all the air you can, by\r\nopening doors, shutters, &c. Let them remain open during pleasant\r\nweather, remembering to close them in wet, damp weather, as well as\r\nnights; and also shading the crop so far as may be from the direct rays\r\nof the sun, to prevent blanching. When it has nearly cured, shut it up\r\nand let it remain till perfectly cured. This may be known by the stem of\r\nthe leaves being dried up, so that no green sap will show itself. If you\r\nhave hung in your stables and other places that you wish to use, it will\r\nbe necessary to take it down and strip it at the first favourable\r\nopportunity, which is described farther along. The separate building\r\nelsewhere described is to be preferred, as it does not necessitate any\r\nimmediate hurry in getting it down. In such it can be allowed to hang\r\nand freeze and thaw two or three times, which improves the colour and\r\nweight, and will give more leisure in stripping, &c. Watch a favourable\r\ntime, when it rains and is damp, to open your buildings, and let in the\r\ndamp air till the tobacco is damped, so that it can be handled without\r\nany danger of breaking the leaves. It need not get too damp, as in that\r\ncase it is liable to injure in the pile before you can get it stripped.\r\nIt will gain dampness from the stalk.”\r\n\r\nThe Cuban tobacco planter, according to Davis, “would force the drying\r\nin wet weather and retard it in dry weather, as either extreme is\r\ninjurious; the wet is injurious, as the leaves, when they change from\r\nthe natural colour to a pale yellow and light brown, easily mildew; when\r\ndry, as before-named, it is taken down. Damp weather is best, so as not\r\nto break the leaves, which are immediately stripped from the stalks and\r\nsorted into as many grades as the market may require, from one to four\r\nand even more grades, as ‘bright yellow, dull, seconds, and\r\nground-leaves.’ But I see no necessity for but three grades, as the\r\nover-ripe, the unripe, and the just ripe at cutting, and when properly\r\ndried they show their grade plain enough to sort. After being stripped\r\nand sorted, they are to be separately piled (‘bulked’ some say) in\r\ncourses of leaves—2, 4, or 6 tiers of leaves, stems end out, and 3–4\r\nfeet high. The leaves should be kept straight in all these handlings.\r\nThe heap should be made up each day separate, as it begins to make\r\ntobacco in 12 hours or so, by fermenting, which is variously called\r\n‘curing,’ ‘sweating,’ ‘conditioning,’ &c. Soon as the heap begins to get\r\nwarm it should be re-piled, putting the inner tier out so as to equalize\r\nthe fermentation; some re-pile several times and some none; but the\r\nfermentation should be kept equal, and if covered with old sail-cloth it\r\ncan be regulated. This fermenting is allowed to proceed for 4–6 weeks by\r\ncareful manufacturers; as it is the process that makes the tobacco to\r\nsuit the taste of tobacco-epicures it should be carefully done, yet many\r\ndo it in a careless manner, and thus have an article so poor as to not\r\nfind many lovers. At the end of the 4–6 weeks the Cuba grower would have\r\none side of each leaf slightly moistened with the decoction of tobacco,\r\nwhich is made by letting some leaves rot in clean water, and then he\r\nwould tie it up in hanks of 25 or 30 leaves, and hang one day for\r\ndrying, then take it down and pack it in tight casks as being best. From\r\nthese leaves he would make the best Cuba cigars. The Virginian grower\r\nwould not wet his tobacco after it had fermented, but simply tie it in\r\nhanks so that 5 or 6 would weigh a pound, and then pack it in his\r\nhogsheads for market; and this, after it had lain from one to six months\r\nin the ‘conditioning bulks.’”\r\n\r\nBurton, translating from Mitjen, goes more fully into the Cuban\r\npractice. He advises firstly that the “shoots and the sprouts should be\r\nput apart from the principal tobacco, with which it should never be\r\nmixed, neither in the heaps nor in the packages. The day after the\r\ntobacco has been cut and placed in the curing-houses, the poles should\r\nbe pushed together, making thus a compact mass, with the object, that by\r\nmeans of the warmth, which this contact produces, the fermentation\r\nshould commence, called _maduradero_. In this state it should remain 2\r\nor 3 days, according to the consistency of the tobacco and the state of\r\nthe atmosphere. By means of this first fermentation it acquires an equal\r\nand a yellowish colour: by the second or third day, at the latest, this\r\ncolour should be uniform, and then without loss of time the poles should\r\nbe spread apart, and given all the ventilation possible, so that\r\nfermentation may not continue, and the drying of the leaves may be\r\nfacilitated—care being taken that they are not exposed to the dew, the\r\nsun, nor to sprinkling of water, should it rain. As the tobacco dries,\r\nthe poles should be hung on higher pegs, so as to leave the lower ones\r\nunoccupied for the fresh leaves brought from the fields. This operation\r\nshould be performed early in the morning whilst the leaves are flexible\r\nand soft; because later in the day they become crisper, and are more apt\r\nto tear.\r\n\r\n“It is not judicious to allow the tobacco to dry too precipitately, by\r\nexposing it to a very strong current of air, because strong wind greatly\r\ninjures its quality; many leaves break, and that silkiness of appearance\r\nis destroyed which good leaves should have, and which it is desirable to\r\npreserve. During heavy winds the doors of the drying-house should be\r\nkept closed; they should also be kept closed if there is much dampness\r\nin the atmosphere occasioned by heavy and continuous rain. Dampness\r\ncauses mildew, which shows itself first in the points of the leaves, and\r\nis the commencement of the rot. Under these circumstances, and to check\r\nthis evil, it is convenient to spread, or part the poles a little; and\r\nif the rains, or the excess of humidity continue, fires should be\r\nkindled and smoke made in the curing-houses, opening at the same time\r\nthe doors and the windows, so as to facilitate the circulation of air\r\nwhilst the smoking is going on.\r\n\r\n“After the tobacco is thoroughly dry, it should be placed on the highest\r\nbeams, or pegs, of the framework which support the poles, squeezing them\r\ncompactly together. This must be done in the morning whilst the leaves\r\nare soft, and all this should be done with a view of protecting it from\r\nthe effects of change in the atmosphere. The house should, after this,\r\nbe kept closed, until it is time to make the heaps.\r\n\r\n“The object of heaping up the tobacco is to produce a second\r\nfermentation, so as to equalize the colour of the leaf and wear out of\r\nit that excess of gluten or resinous matter which is natural to the\r\nplant; this fermentation makes the leaves more silky and ductile, and\r\ngives them a more agreeable flavour. The place for making the heaps\r\nshould be prepared beforehand, in one or more of the rooms of the\r\ntobacco-house, by making a kind of box lined with _yaguas_ (sheets of\r\npalm-tree bark) at the bottom and the sides, the base is a boarding on\r\nwhich should be placed a sufficient quantity of dry plantain leaves,\r\nwhich serve as a bed for the heaps.\r\n\r\n“In the months of April or May, when the rainy season commences, the\r\npoles which are on the highest pegs of the scaffolding should be taken\r\ndown and placed somewhat apart, one from the other, on the lower pegs.\r\nThe doors of the house should be left open at night, so that the\r\nhumidity from the atmosphere may enter, and when, in the morning, the\r\ntobacco is found to be soft and silky, it is fit to be placed in heaps.\r\nThe pairs of leaves should then be collected in armfuls, with all the\r\nbits of stalks placed in one direction; the leaves that may be found\r\ndoubled or crooked should be smoothed out, and each armful should be\r\nplaced in layers in the heaps, placing the first layer at the bottom\r\nwith all the woody pieces of the stalk touching the _yagua_ which forms\r\nthe sides of the case; other layers should be placed with the stalk\r\nreversed, and in this manner, crossing the leaves, the pile should be\r\nraised up level. When a pile has a sufficient height, another, and\r\nanother, is made until the tobacco is finished or the case is full, so\r\nthat each heap may form a compact mass of leaves protected by the pieces\r\nof stalk all round, which should never touch the leaves, but only touch\r\neach other. When the heaps have been thus made, they should be covered\r\nwith dry plantain leaves, or palm skins, and, in front, by palm leaves.\r\n\r\n“Tobacco should not be packed thus when it is too damp, because a very\r\nstrong fermentation would ensue, which, if kept up longer than\r\nnecessary, would pass to putrefaction. The tobacco only requires to be\r\nsoft, or flexible, before packing, so as to produce a certain degree of\r\nheat, neither is it convenient to pack tobacco when too dry, for then it\r\nwould not ferment at all, nor would any beneficial results be produced.\r\nWhen it has been packed sufficiently soft, it undergoes after the second\r\nor third day a degree of heat of 110° to 120° F. in the centre of the\r\nheap, and if it does not acquire this degree of heat it is because it\r\nhas been packed too dry.\r\n\r\n“We have already said that reaping or cutting tobacco should be\r\nperformed in three distinct sections, preserving always a distinction,\r\nconsequently the crown leaves should form one heap, or one set of heaps;\r\nthe second and third pairs another, or others; the fourths and the\r\nfifths others; and lastly, the _capaduras_ (second shoots from the same\r\nplants) others. This system, besides having the advantages which we have\r\nin another place described, greatly facilitates the sorting of the\r\nleaves, as the different qualities are from the first kept apart, and\r\nscarcely any other work remains to be done than that of taking out the\r\nbroken leaves. Tobacco should be kept for at least 30 days in heaps,\r\nafter which, sorting and choosing the leaves may commence, beginning\r\nfirst with the heaps of the inferior qualities.”\r\n\r\n_Stripping._—Stripping may be performed at any time, provided the\r\nleaves, after being once properly dried, have again become pliable. For\r\nstripping, such a number of plants as will furnish work for several days\r\nare taken down on a morning, when the plants have absorbed some\r\nmoisture, and have become elastic; they are put in a heap, and properly\r\ncovered, to check evaporation. If, however, the night air should be so\r\nvery dry that the leaves cannot absorb sufficient moisture to become\r\npliable, a moist atmosphere can be created either by steam, or by\r\npouring water on the floor, or by keeping vessels with water in the\r\nshed. If this cannot be done, the tobacco must remain hanging until\r\nthere is damp weather. Under no condition should the tobacco be stripped\r\nwhen not pliant, that is if the leaves are so brittle that they would\r\nbreak when bent or rolled. The best arrangement is to keep the\r\ndrying-shed and stripping-room separate, since the latter requires to be\r\nmore moist than the former. A cellar under the drying-shed is best\r\nsuited for stripping. It should be large enough to admit of the erection\r\nof a scaffold to receive the tobacco.\r\n\r\nPursley looks upon stripping as being labour suited to damp weather. He\r\nsays, “the lugs, shipping, and manufacturing, which are worst, medium,\r\nand best qualities, should be separated at stripping. The ‘lugs,’ or\r\nworst quality, are found at the bottom of the plant; they are chaffy and\r\nlight leaves, and should be stripped from the stalk and tied in bundles\r\nby themselves with all of the ragged, black, and injured leaves. The\r\nsecond quality, or ‘shipping tobacco,’ is a grade above the lugs; it is\r\nthe red or brown tobacco; this should also be tied in separate bundles.\r\nThe best, or ‘manufacturing,’ is the finest and brightest leaves, and\r\nshould be put in bundles by itself. In stripping, the stems of the\r\nleaves should be broken off as close as possible to the stalk; this adds\r\nto the weight of the tobacco. In forming a bundle, the butts of the\r\nleaves should be placed evenly, and closely together, and pressed\r\ntightly in the hand; then a leaf should be folded to form a wrapper 2\r\ninches in width; then wrap it tightly and smoothly around the butts of\r\nthe leaves, winding it from the end down, about 2½ inches, then open the\r\nbundle in the middle, and tuck the wrapper-leaf through the opening, and\r\ndraw it snug, so that when the opening is closed the wrapper-leaf will\r\nremain; this forms a bundle which we call a ‘hand of tobacco.’ The hands\r\nshould be strung on sticks, and hoisted up in the barn on the\r\ntier-poles; 18–20 hands may be put on each stick, at equal distances\r\napart.”\r\n\r\nLibhart expresses his opinions on stripping in the following words. “At\r\nthe setting in of a warm, drizzling, wet, foggy spell of weather, the\r\nshed must be opened on all sides to allow the damp atmosphere to pervade\r\nthe whole interior; after the dry leaves have become damp enough to\r\nallow handling in any degree without breaking, the stalks must be taken\r\noff the lath or pulled down and laid in heaps about 18 inches or 2 feet\r\nhigh, and any desired length; if it is not intended to strip it\r\nimmediately, it should be conveyed to a cellar or other apartment, where\r\nit will remain damp; it should not, however, be suffered to remain\r\nlonger than 2 or 3 days in heaps, without examination, as there is\r\nsometimes sufficient moisture remaining in the stalks or frozen leaves\r\nto create heat and rot the good tobacco. If found to be heating, it\r\nshould be changed about and aired and be stripped immediately. If found\r\nto be drying out, further evaporation may be checked by covering the\r\nheaps with damp straw or corn-fodder. Tobacco is usually stripped into\r\ntwo qualities, ‘ground-leaf,’ or ‘fillers,’ and ‘wrappers’; the leaves\r\nthat lie next the ground, generally from 2 to 4, are always more or less\r\ndamaged by sand beaten on by the rain and other causes, hence they only\r\ncommand about half the price of the good tobacco or ‘wrappers.’ The\r\nground-leaves are taken off first and tied up separately in bunches.\r\nWith a bunch clasped in one hand, take a leaf and wrap it around\r\n(beginning at the end of the bunch), confining the end under the first\r\nturn, continue to wrap smoothly and neatly until about 3 inches of the\r\nleaf remains, then open the bunch in the middle and draw the remaining\r\npart of the leaf through. This forms a neat and compact ‘hand,’ that\r\nwill bear a great deal of handling without coming open. After the\r\nground-leaves have been removed, the good leaves are stripped off and\r\ntied up the same as the ground-leaves, with this exception: the leaves\r\nof each stalk should be tied in a bunch by themselves, to preserve a\r\nuniformity in colour and size, as tobacco is sold in the market\r\naccording to colour and size, therefore if the leaves of a large and a\r\nsmall plant, or of a dark-coloured and a light one, be tied up together,\r\nit at once diminishes the appearance and value of the crop.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 12.\r\n               HAND OF TOBACCO.]\r\n\r\nDennis describes stripping as being “performed by holding the plant, top\r\ndown, with the left hand, while with the right hand the leaves are\r\npulled off, taking care to have the stems all even in the hand, so that\r\nthe ends are together. When 10–15 leaves have thus been grasped by the\r\nright hand, change the handful to the left hand, and with the right,\r\nselect a leaf and wrap it around the stems at the end, so as to bind\r\nthem altogether and cover up the ends, then split the other leaves apart\r\nwith the finger, and pull the end of your wrapping-leaf through, and you\r\nhave a ‘hand’ of tobacco. A small ‘hand’ of leaves, uniform in size and\r\ncolour, will be found the most desirable shape to tie it in, resembling\r\nFig. 12. The bottom leaves of the plant, and all torn and defective\r\nleaves, should be tied up by themselves, and are known as ‘lugs.’ These\r\n‘hands’ should be ‘bulked’ again, with the wrapped end out, and covered\r\nwith straw, or anything that will retain the ‘case,’ and if subject to\r\nimmediate sale, may be boxed up or hauled to market. If boxed, it should\r\nbe put in tight boxes—if hauled, it should be kept covered until\r\nunloaded. Care must be taken to avoid ‘high case’—extreme dampness or\r\nsoftness in bulking tobacco after it is stripped—as it may be ‘funked’\r\nin bulk, and ruined; and it should not be packed in that condition when\r\nit is liable to remain long. It is a crop that is never off of hands.”\r\n\r\nAccording to Perry Hull, stripping, or, as he terms it, “picking,”\r\nshould not take place till about December; “at least not until the _fat\r\nstems_ (main stems of the leaves, which are not thoroughly cured at the\r\nbutt-end) have mostly or all disappeared, which they will have done by\r\nthat time, if the crop reached maturity before harvesting. The\r\noperations of picking and assorting are by many, who make only two\r\nclasses or qualities of the tobacco, carried on at the same time. By far\r\nthe preferable way is, especially if there is a very large crop to pick,\r\nto take off the leaves during damp or wet weather, tie them into bundles\r\nof 15–20 lb., with twine, and pack it away into cellars, or wherever it\r\ncan be kept without drying up. It can then be assorted in any kind of\r\nweather, thus gaining considerable time, as two will pick and tie up in\r\nthis way as much during one wet spell as 6 hands would, assorting and\r\nhanking up, at the same time. Another reason why the last practice is\r\npreferable is, that, by the former, the assorting can be but\r\nindifferently done; whereas, by the last, it can be done as carefully as\r\ndesired. Tobacco should not be allowed to get too wet before picking; in\r\nfact, should not be allowed to get wet at all, so as to feel wet, only\r\njust damp enough to make the leaves pliable, so as to handle and pack\r\nwithout breaking or feeling husky. If allowed to get wet, before\r\npicking, it is next to impossible to get it dried to the proper state\r\nagain so uniformly but that some of the leaves will still be too wet,\r\nwhile others will be dry enough to crack and break. So if the rains are\r\nlong enough to get it too wet, which they often are, by all means let it\r\nremain upon the poles until the next wet spell.”\r\n\r\n_Sorting._—Tobacco intended for smoking should be carefully sorted when\r\nstripped. There should be four sorts: 1st, large, equally good coloured,\r\nuntorn leaves; 2nd, leaves of good size and colour, but torn; 3rd,\r\nleaves of inferior colour, and bottom leaves; 4th, refuse, shrivelled-up\r\nleaves, &c., to which may be added the suckers No. 1 leaves, when thin,\r\nelastic, and of good sorts, are mostly valued as wrappers (outside\r\ncovers) for cigars, No. 2 may also be used as wrappers, but are less\r\nvalued than No. 1; they are adapted for fillers and cut tobacco. The\r\ndifferent sorts are kept separate. The best plan is to let the most\r\nintelligent man strip the leaves from the stem, and at once separate\r\nthem according to quality. The leaves should then be made into hands,\r\ni.e. 10–20 leaves should be tied together by twisting a leaf round the\r\nend of the stalks, each sort being attended by a special man, to avoid\r\nmixing. The leaves of the first sort being large, 10–15 will be\r\nsufficient for a hand; more are required of the other sorts. When making\r\nthe hands of the two first sorts, each leaf is taken separately,\r\nsmoothened on a flat board, and left there while another is treated in\r\nthe same way, continuing thus until a sufficient number is ready to make\r\na hand. When the hand is ready, it is laid aside, and a weight is placed\r\nupon it to keep the leaves smooth.\r\n\r\nTo sell well, according to Perry Hull, tobacco “should be assorted into\r\nthree classes or grades, Wrappers, Seconds, and Fillers. The wrappers\r\nwill include the soundest, best-coloured leaves, the colour (a dark\r\ncinnamon) should be as uniform as possible; this quality should include\r\nnothing but what is fit for wrappers. The Seconds, which are used as\r\nbinders for cigars, &c., will include the small top leaves, of which, if\r\nthe tobacco was topped too high, there will be one or two to each\r\nplant—the bad colours, and those leaves somewhat damaged by worms and\r\nbad handling, but not so much so as to be ragged. The third class, or\r\nFillers, will include the balance of the crop, bottom leaves, ragged\r\nleaves, &c. The tobacco should be done up into hanks of about ⅓ lb.\r\neach, or about what can be encompassed by the thumb and fingers, winding\r\nat the butt with a pliable leaf, drawing the end through the hank to\r\nsecure it.”\r\n\r\nThe Cuban system of sorting is described at considerable length by\r\nMitjen, whose remarks are interpreted by Burton as follows. The\r\noperation consists in “separating one from the other the different\r\nleaves, according to their strength and quality, and dividing the\r\nproduce of the crop into various classes. These are, in practice, styled\r\n_Libra_, 1st quality; _Quebrado_, 2nd quality, broken; _Injuriado de\r\nprimera_; _Injuriado de segunda_, _de tercera_, _de cuarta_, _de\r\nquinta_, _de sexta_, _de setima_; _Libra de pie_, and _capadura_.\r\n\r\n“Under this classification it is presumed that attention has been\r\nbestowed, not only to the special quality of the leaf, but also to its\r\nsize, and its state, whether whole or broken; but it is very seldom that\r\nexactness is found in this classification, because but very few persons\r\npossess the requisite skill which such a complicated mode of sorting\r\nrequires. Moreover, by the abuse of mixing in one heap all kinds of\r\nleaves, frequently brought in from the fields all mixed together, the\r\nproper sorting of tobacco becomes a very complicated affair.\r\n\r\n“This kind of classification and nomenclature is, moreover, absurd, and\r\ndoes not positively represent fixed qualities, under the denomination of\r\nwhich, prices might be arranged which would serve as a guide to the\r\nmerchant as well as the grower. In a word, the names, with which the\r\ndifferent qualities of tobacco are to-day distinguished, signify\r\nnothing, and it is ridiculous to be guided in business by them. Until\r\nthis kind of classification and nomenclature is changed, it is\r\nimpossible to quote the mercantile prices for the different qualities,\r\nbecause the name does not represent the quality; and this confusion\r\ntends greatly to the prejudice of the planter, and the merchant; and\r\nhinders attaining the perfection after which we should strive.\r\n\r\n“We have shown that the practice of making a classification of seven\r\n_Injuriados_ must not be taken as absolute. There are better modes of\r\nsorting in which a separation of 8, and even 9 _Injuriados_ should be\r\nmade, and others, and by far the greater proportion, in which only 5\r\n_Injuriados_ should be separated; so that the quality which, in one\r\nsorting, would appear under that of fifths—being the lowest of the\r\ncrop—would be equal to eighths, or ninths, if picked more carefully; and\r\nthe fifths, in a sorting, whose lowest class may be sevenths, is about\r\nequal in quality to that of thirds of other pickings, whose lowest class\r\nwould be fifths, if both crops had produced equal kinds of tobacco.\r\n\r\n“There is even more to confirm our opinion. Supposing two crops equal in\r\nall respects, and that each planter makes a separation of 7\r\n_Injuriados_. This would not ensure that the intrinsic value of each\r\nrespective quality would be equal; for each _Veguero_ has his own\r\nparticular mode of considering the different classes, and some make a\r\nmuch more careful sorting than others. In the supposed case it may\r\nhappen, as it frequently does, that the _Veguero_ A will take from his\r\ncrop—which we will suppose to be one hundred packages—2 of the first, 3\r\nof the second, 5 of the third, 8 of the fourth, 12 of the fifth, 30 of\r\nthe sixth, and 40 of the seventh; whereas the _Veguero_ B will take from\r\nhis, 4 of the first, 6 of the second, 10 of the third, 16 of the fourth,\r\n32 of the fifth, 21 of the sixth, and 11 of the seventh; and it would\r\nresult, from the comparison of these two supposed pickings, that each of\r\nthese classes of the _Vega_ A would correspond to the immediate superior\r\none of the _Vega_ B, as will be shown on the following calculation:—\r\n\r\n                                  A.\r\n                                          $        $\r\n                       2 Bales, 1st at  120  =   240\r\n                       3   ”    2nd ”   100  =   300\r\n                       5   ”    3rd ”    80  =   400\r\n                       8   ”    4th ”    60  =   480\r\n                      12   ”    5th ”    40  =   480\r\n                      30   ”    6th ”    25  =   750\r\n                      40   ”    7th ”    20  =   800\r\n                      ——                         ———\r\n                     100                       $3450\r\n                      ——                         ———\r\n\r\n                                  B.\r\n                                          $        $\r\n                       4 Bales, 1st at  100  =   400\r\n                       6   ”    2nd ”    80  =   480\r\n                      10   ”    3rd ”    60  =   600\r\n                      16   ”    4th ”    40  =   640\r\n                      32   ”    5th ”    25  =   800\r\n                      21   ”    6th ”    20  =   420\r\n                      11   ”    7th ”    10  =   110\r\n                     ———                        ————\r\n                     100                       $3450\r\n                     ———                        ————\r\n\r\n“Here it may be seen that the second of A is worth as much as the first\r\nof B, the third of A as much as the second of B, and so successively in\r\nthe other classes; and as it is of importance that names should\r\nrepresent fixed objects, and that each quality should represent a\r\nrelative value, we think that the sortings and the classifications\r\ndeserve a reform, which would undoubtedly bring with it advantages to\r\nthe planter, to the merchant, the manufacturer, and the consumer.\r\n\r\n“The reform in the sortings should take its origin from a reform in the\r\nplantation or field, and principally in the manner of cutting. By\r\nobserving a methodical and well-calculated system, each one of the\r\noperations prepares and facilitates the execution of the succeeding one.\r\nIn its proper place, we have recommended that the tobacco planter should\r\nnot attempt to plant more than 12,000 plants for each labourer employed,\r\nso that all the plants may receive proper cultivation and attention. If\r\nall these plants are equally well taken care of, if the land has been\r\nproperly prepared with manure, and all have had the same advantage of\r\nseason, it is a necessary consequence that the fruit will be equally\r\ngood. If afterwards the cutting or cropping is made in 3 sections,\r\npreserving always the separation we have recommended, we shall have,\r\nnaturally, not a capricious assortment of leaves, but one in the order\r\nestablished by nature.\r\n\r\n“None will, we think, question the fact that the pairs of leaves on one\r\nstalk must be equal in quality to those cut from an adjoining stalk,\r\nthat is to say, all the crown leaves must be of the same quality, all\r\nthe second also, and so successively. This admitted, we have the\r\nseparation of qualities made, almost, in the field, and it only remains\r\nto separate the sizes, and the sound leaves from the torn ones, an\r\noperation which any person can make; and thus it will be unnecessary to\r\nemploy those workmen who style themselves sorters, who are supposed to\r\nhave an exact knowledge of the properties of each leaf. The sortings\r\nought, therefore, to be made by classes, or by bales, each containing\r\nthe separate qualities beginning with the bale of _capaduras_ and\r\n_mamones_, which may be mixed together in the same bale. Of this\r\nquality, however, not more than two classes should be made, which may be\r\ncalled suckers and sprouts; and in the class called sprouts, the sound\r\nand larger leaves of good consistency should be placed. The result would\r\nbe a _tripa_ of good quality, and, after throwing away all those that\r\nare really without substance, the remainder would form the second class,\r\nand would make a useful _tripa_, although inferior to the former.\r\n\r\n“When these are made, the next bales should be made of tobacco chosen\r\nfrom the inferior class of leaves, of which 3 classes ought to be made,\r\nand called _sano_, _quebrado_, and _desecho de tercera_. In the first\r\nclass of these, which we will call third quality, should be placed all\r\nthe sound leaves which have any consistency; and this would form a weak\r\n_capa_, equal to that which is now called clear fifths, _quinta limpia_,\r\nand this might be called _sano de tercera_. The second class should\r\ncontain the torn or broken leaves of good consistency, but not so much\r\nbroken or injured as to merit only the name of shavings, as the leaves\r\nwhich are very much torn, or small pieces of leaves, are called. This\r\nclass would be called _quebrado de tercera_, and might be used for\r\ninferior _tripa_. The last class of this quality, after throwing away\r\nall the useless leaves, would be called _desecho_.\r\n\r\n“After this, and in the same order as the preceding, three classes\r\nshould be made from the sortings for the heaps of bad seconds and\r\nthirds, and called _sano_, _quebrado_, and _tripa_ of the second class.\r\nThe first of these should contain all the sound leaves, and should be\r\ncalled _sano de segunda_, second-class sound. The second should be\r\ncomposed of the damaged leaves, but good for making _capa_, and should\r\nbe called second-class broken; and the third, which will be the most\r\nbroken, should be called second-class _tripa_.\r\n\r\n“Finally, the picking, or sorting for the pile of pairs of crown leaves\r\nshould be made; and of this quality there should also be three classes,\r\nwhich will be denominated ‘_sano_,’ ‘_quebrado_,’ and ‘_tripa de\r\ncorona_,’ observing always the same order as was done for the piles or\r\nheaps of seconds and thirds.\r\n\r\n“Sorting carried on in this order is so simplified that we do not doubt\r\nit might be done in one-third the time taken under the present system;\r\nand the labour of the resorters would be dispensed with, which most of\r\nthe _vegueros_ have now to employ and pay, as many of them do not\r\nconsider themselves sufficiently expert in the matter to classify their\r\nown tobacco. This classification and nomenclature represent exact\r\nqualities to which a relative value can be fixed, and may serve as a\r\nbase for mercantile transactions.\r\n\r\n“The manufacturer will not have to contend with bales of mixed tobacco\r\ncontaining all the different classes which the _vega_ may have produced;\r\nand he will find this division very convenient to determine the time\r\nwhen each class may be used without having any loss from finding in them\r\nleaves that are not seasoned, whilst others of the same bale, and\r\nperhaps of the same _manojo_, may have become deteriorated from having\r\nremained too long in fermentation. The manufacturer will, without any\r\ngreat trouble, be able to make the assortment for strong and weak\r\n_tripa_ according to the quality of _capa_ which is going to be used, a\r\nmost essential point in cigar making, and thus he will be able to make\r\ncigars with all perfection. All these advantages will result from\r\nadopting the reform in the manner of sorting which we propose. And, in\r\nspite of its simplicity, it is much more positive and extensive, as it\r\nwill be composed of four qualities subdivided into eleven classes. The\r\nconsumer, too, will have the advantage of being able to procure cigars\r\nmanufactured completely of the quality which he prefers, and the\r\ncontents of each box, or each set of boxes, will be all equal both in\r\nflavour and colour, which, under the present system, it is difficult to\r\nfind. The classes will be styled:—\r\n\r\n                           {  1st class  Sound crown.\r\n           First quality   {  2nd  ”     Broken   ”\r\n                           {  3rd  ”     Stuffing ”\r\n\r\n                           {  1st class  Sound seconds.\r\n           Second quality  {  2nd  ”     Broken   ”\r\n                           {  3rd  ”     Stuffing ”\r\n\r\n                           {  1st class  Sound thirds.\r\n           Third quality   {  2nd  ”     Broken   ”\r\n                           {  3rd  ”     Stuffing ”\r\n\r\n            Fourth quality, 1st and 2nd Suckers and sprouts.\r\n\r\n“It is scarcely necessary to add that, according to the preceding system\r\nof sorting, only 3 divisions, cases, or rooms, with _yaguas_, will be\r\nrequired for depositing the respective qualities which the workmen may\r\nbe assorting, until sufficient quantity has been collected in each to\r\ncommence the seasoning or painting, _betumeo_, _enmannillado_, or\r\n_engavillado_, _manojo_, and _enterciadura_.\r\n\r\n“In all kinds of sortings, the fragments of broken leaves, too small to\r\nuse for cigars, should be collected, sponged, and with them packages\r\nmade of _picadura_. This should be preserved, and the following year it\r\nwill be useful for making _betun_. Wash the tobacco, or rather sponge\r\nit, with a solution made from these pieces of good leaves, and not with\r\na solution made from stalks and trash of new tobacco, as some do. The\r\nwash (_betun_) has the same effect on tobacco that yeast has on bread.\r\nIt is the agent employed to produce a strong and quick fermentation,\r\nfrom which results that strong and agreeable aroma that may be observed\r\nin old tobacco which has been well _betumeado_ (sponged with tobacco\r\ninfusion). This infusion, made with fresh tobacco, is not bad if made\r\ncarefully, but we consider that made with old tobacco is the best,\r\nbecause it instantly imparts an agreeable odour to the leaves on which\r\nit is used; and, instead of the infusion which is generally used, it\r\nwould be cleaner and better, if a strong decoction was made from\r\n_picadura_—the small pieces of leaves of good tobacco—and used after it\r\nhad become cold, or on the day after the boiling is made.\r\n\r\n“If the wash is made by infusion, at least two jugs should be used to\r\nmake it in, and it should be only used on the third or fourth day,\r\nrenewing it as often as it appears to pass into a state of putrid\r\nfermentation, in which state it is of no use, and on which account two\r\ndeposits are necessary, so that one at least may always be in a fit\r\nstate to use, whilst the other is acquiring the necessary strength and a\r\ntransparent golden colour, in which state it is fit for use.\r\n\r\n“Each tobacco leaf should be dyed separately, and not, as some do, after\r\nit has been made up into _gavillas_—small bundles tied at one end of the\r\nleaf. It is very important that all the leaves should equally receive\r\nthe benefit, and this is impossible when several are tied together. The\r\ngood system of dyeing is used by all practical _vegueros_; to save\r\nlabour some do it otherwise, to the great injury of the aroma and\r\nquality, and no small risk of the tobacco becoming spotted, and full of\r\nholes; for tobacco invariably commences to show these spots and small\r\nholes near the heads of the _gavilla_, where the dye has not been able\r\nto penetrate owing to the manner in which the leaves are tied. Each leaf\r\nought, therefore, to be dyed separately, as the most intelligent people\r\ndo. The leaves should be placed separately in rows on a bench, having\r\nall the heads in one line; then the dye should be applied by means of a\r\nsponge, which should be soaked in the dye or infusion, and squeezed, so\r\nthat a dampness only will be communicated to the leaf.\r\n\r\n“In passing the sponge over the leaf, it should be drawn from the head\r\nor thick part near the stalk, down the large vein to the point, so that\r\nthe thick vein down the centre of the leaf may receive the heaviest part\r\nof the infusion, from which the dye pushes along the transversal veins,\r\nand all parts derive benefit from it.\r\n\r\n“After dyeing the first layer on the bench, another one is placed above\r\nthis, keeping always the leaves in the same direction; and this\r\noperation is repeated, and each layer is sponged, until the pile from\r\nwhich they are taken is exhausted. As this new pile of dyed leaves\r\ngradually increases in height, it should be gently pressed down with the\r\nhand, and, when finished, should be covered over with green plantain\r\nleaves. This operation should be done in the morning, and by nightfall\r\nthe tobacco will have acquired the necessary softness, and soaked up the\r\ninfusion, so that the leaves, although very flexible, will have no signs\r\nof excess in moisture. If they have, they should be spread to dry\r\nsomewhat, because, when the bundles of leaves are being tied up, they\r\nshould not be excessively wet, as the result would probably be so strong\r\na fermentation that it would degenerate into a putrid one. The leaves\r\nshould have a soft silkiness, but should have no positive signs of water\r\non them after they have been dyed.\r\n\r\n“When the tobacco is in a good state of softness, the next operation is\r\nthe ‘_cabeceo_.’ This operation consists in uniting the leaves by the\r\nheads—putting them perfectly even, and joining together a uniform number\r\nof each class. The leaves should be collected in the palm of the left\r\nhand, drawing gently the right hand over all the length of each leaf\r\nfrom the head to the point, and tying them at the heads with a piece of\r\n_yagua_ or vine, or, as most people do, by binding one of the leaves\r\nround the head of the bundle. This operation is generally made in the\r\nevening, and the following morning they should be placed in the bales,\r\nas it injures the tobacco to allow it to dry in _manojos_ before putting\r\nit into bales, for, if too dry, fermentation is retarded, or is\r\nincomplete in the bales.\r\n\r\n“We have described the manner of washing or dyeing, in making the\r\n_gavillas_, and tying them in bundles as the most practical _vegueros_\r\ndo. In this part we should not, we think, advise any innovation, except\r\nthat of using old seasoned tobacco instead of fresh for making the\r\ninfusion, and substituting a decoction made by boiling, instead of an\r\ninfusion in cold water. But we strongly advise a reform in the sorting\r\nand the classification; and a fixed number of each class of leaves\r\nshould be put in each _gavilla_, as a basis from which to start all\r\ncalculations for mercantile transactions. We believe, therefore, it\r\nwould be convenient to fix, after the following order, the number of\r\nleaves which each head ‘gavilla’ should contain:-\r\n\r\n                  { Sound           25 leaves to each _gavilla_\r\n  First quality   { Broken or torn  30     ”              ”\r\n                  { For stuffing    40     ”              ”\r\n\r\n                  { Sound           30     ”              ”\r\n  Second quality  { Broken or torn  35     ”              ”\r\n                  { Stuffing        43     ”              ”\r\n\r\n                  { Sound           40     ”              ”\r\n  Third quality   { Broken or torn  45     ”              ”\r\n                  { _Desecho_        } These three classes\r\n                                     }   may be added without\r\n  Fourth quality  { Suckers          }   counting the\r\n                  { Sprouts          }   number of leaves,\r\n\r\nbut making the heads (_gavillas_) of a regular uniform size; and the\r\n_manojos_ and bales of about the same size as those of ‘sound’ and\r\n‘broken’ of the third quality, the latter weighing 100–125 lb.\r\n\r\n“By following strictly this method, and by establishing these quantities\r\nand qualities, as a basis for all contracts, any defects found might\r\neasily be obviated; and very exact calculations might be made of the\r\nnumber of cigars each bale would yield, after having examined its\r\nspecial condition; and its real value might be estimated either by bales\r\nor bundles, or by weight.”\r\n\r\n_Bulking._—Bulking means placing the tobacco-leaves in heaps for the\r\npurpose of heating, in order to develop colour and flavour; this is\r\ncarried out in various ways, nearly all involving great labour and risk,\r\nas in most instances tobacco loses more or less in value during the\r\nprocess called “curing.” The more care is taken in raising the crop, the\r\nless attention the tobacco requires in the shed. With a good kind of\r\ntobacco, grown on light, friable soil, treated as described, little care\r\nwill be needed, after the leaves are dried and stripped. By the drying\r\nprocess, the leaves will have undergone a slow fermentation, which makes\r\nit unnecessary to watch or guide a regular fermentation afterwards,\r\nhence bulking and fermenting, as generally understood, are not required.\r\n\r\nAfter being made into hands, the tobacco is put into heaps (bulked)\r\nbefore it again dries. Every evening, the tobacco that has been stripped\r\nduring the day is bulked; but if the weather be very dry, it must be\r\nbulked as soon as a certain number of hands is ready. The heaps should\r\nbe made 4–8 feet square and 4–8 feet high; all the stalks are outside,\r\nand the whole is covered by mats, &c., to check evaporation. The drier\r\nthe tobacco, the larger must the heaps be made, to encourage a slight\r\nfermentation. The extent of the fermentation can be easily controlled.\r\nIf the colour of the leaves is not uniform, or if it is desired to give\r\nthem a browner colour, the heaps must be made large, and a somewhat\r\nmoist atmosphere is required in the storing-room. This will cause\r\nfermentation to set in after a short time, and the heat to rise after\r\nsome days, so much so that rebulking is required, which is done by\r\nputting the top leaves of the old heap at the bottom of the new one.\r\nUnder such circumstances, the heap must be frequently examined during\r\nthe few first weeks, to prevent overheating. It is advisable to rebulk\r\nthe tobacco also, even when not much heated, after the first fourteen\r\ndays, and again a month later, to ascertain the exact state in which it\r\nis. Sometimes the tobacco becomes mouldy; this occurs especially with\r\ntobacco which has been manured with chlorides, which cause it to become\r\nmore hygroscopic than when manured otherwise. If this occurs, the mould\r\nmust be brushed off, and, if necessary, the tobacco be dried. The\r\ntobacco may now remain heaped in the store-room until there is a chance\r\nfor sale. It must be remembered, however, that the best time for selling\r\nvaries very much. Some tobacco is fit for smoking a few weeks after\r\ndrying, whereas others may burn very badly at that time, yet become a\r\ngood burning article after being stored for several months.\r\n\r\nAfter assorting, Perry Hull advises that the tobacco “be corded up\r\nawhile, in a dry place, that the butts may be thoroughly cured before\r\npacking in the cases. The pile is made with the butts out, and tips\r\ninterlapping in the middle, at every other course, at the ends turning\r\nthe butts toward the end. Get upon the pile upon the knees, take hold of\r\nthe butt of a hank with one hand, drawing the leaves at the tip together\r\nwith the other, and placing it upon the pile in that position,\r\nimmediately putting the knee upon it. After the pile is finished, it\r\nshould be covered over with boards, to keep it from drying up, and a few\r\ndays before packing into the cases, should be well weighted down, which\r\nwill save a great deal of pressing at that time. Such a pile should be\r\nmade only about 2½–3 feet high, and then closely watched to prevent a\r\npremature sweat, which often, if the weather be mild, will take place in\r\nsuch a pile, which will not be sufficient to render the tobacco fit for\r\nworking, but which, if not intercepted at the commencement, will be\r\nsufficient to prevent a proper sweat afterwards. Check, therefore, the\r\nfirst symptoms of heat in such a pile, by opening the pile, and\r\nrepacking it, shaking out the hanks and giving them time to cool off.”\r\n\r\nBowie gives a caution that the tobacco “should not be too moist or\r\n‘high,’ as it is termed, when put in stalk bulk, or it will get warm,\r\nthe leaves stick to the stalk, get a bad smell, and change colour;\r\nbesides, if left too long, it will rot. To bulk tobacco requires\r\njudgment and neatness. Two logs should be laid parallel to each other,\r\nabout 30 inches apart, and the space between them filled with sticks for\r\nthe purpose of keeping the tobacco from the dampness of the ground. The\r\nbundles are then taken one at a time, spread out and smoothed down,\r\nwhich is most conveniently done by putting it against the breast and\r\nstroking the leaves downward smooth and straight with the right hand. It\r\nis then passed, two bundles at a time, to the man bulking. He takes them\r\nand lays them down and presses them with his hands; they are laid, two\r\nat a time, in a straight line—the broad part of the bundles slightly\r\nprojecting over the next two—and two rows of bundles are put in a bulk,\r\nboth rows carried on together, the heads being on the outside, and the\r\ntails just lapping one over the other in regular succession. The bulk,\r\nwhen carried up to a convenient height, should have a few sticks laid\r\nacross to keep it in place. It must often be examined, and if getting\r\nwarm it ought to be immediately changed and laid down in another bulk of\r\nless height, and not pressed as it is laid down; this is called\r\n‘wind-rowing’; being loose and open, it admits the air between the rows\r\nof bundles, hence the term. The next process in this troublesome, but\r\nbeautiful crop, is to ‘condition’ it for ‘packing.’ The ‘bright,’\r\n‘yellow,’ and ‘second’ tobacco will condition, but most generally in\r\nsuch bulks as I have just described, but it is best to hang up the\r\n‘dull’ as soon almost as stripped. If the bright or second do not dry\r\nthoroughly in the bulks, that should also be hung up in the house to\r\nbecome well dried. To properly hang up tobacco to condition, small-sized\r\nsticks should be procured, and each one nicely smoothed with the\r\ndrawing-knife, and kept for that purpose. After it has once been\r\nperfectly dry, either hanging up or in bulks—so dry that the heads are\r\neasily knocked off, and the shoulders of the bundles crack upon pressure\r\nlike pipe-stems—it should be taken down, or if in bulks, removed, the\r\nfirst soft, moist spell of weather, as soon as it is soft and yielding\r\nenough, as it will become too dry to handle without crumbling or\r\nbreaking, and it must be put in 4 or 6 row bulks of any convenient\r\nlength and height, the higher the better, laid down close, so that as\r\nlittle of the leaves or shoulders as possible be exposed on the outside\r\nof the bulk. When completed put sticks and logs of wood, &c., on the top\r\nso as to weigh it down. Here it will keep sweet and in nice order for\r\npacking at any time, no matter what the weather be, if it was\r\nconditioned properly, it will not change a particle while in the\r\ncondition-bulk.”\r\n\r\n_Packing._—Tobacco in America is commonly packed in barrels, the layers\r\nbeing at right angles to each other alternately, and the butt-ends being\r\nalways towards the outside. The usual size is about 4 feet 6 inches\r\ndeep, 3 feet 6 inches in diameter at one end, and 3 feet 4 inches at the\r\nother, to enable the contents to be uncovered for examination without\r\ndisturbing the mass. The packing is effected under considerable\r\nhydraulic pressure. Elsewhere all kinds of packages are employed, and\r\ntheir weights are very various.\r\n\r\nIn Bishop’s opinion the best size for boxes is the following:—“3 feet 6\r\ninches long, 2 feet 4 inches wide, 2 feet 6 inches in depth,\r\nmanufactured from planed pine boards, 1 inch in thickness, with\r\nstandards 2 inches square, inside at each corner to nail to. Having thus\r\nyour boxes prepared, and the tobacco in good condition, the first soft,\r\nmild day that comes proceed to packing; the bundles or ‘hands’ of\r\ntobacco must be taken from the bulk and laid in courses in the box,\r\nlaying the butts of the ‘hands’ to the outside of the box, allowing the\r\nends to lap over each other, and endeavouring to keep the centre of the\r\nbox a little higher than the edges—these courses to be packed as solid\r\nas possible by the hand. If any of the bundles are ‘soft’ or have an ill\r\nsmell, they must be exposed to the fire or sun until sweet and dry\r\nbefore being packed. When the box is nearly full, a false cover (just\r\nlarge enough to slip inside the box) must be placed on the tobacco, and\r\npressed as heavily as possible with the lever or screw power; remove the\r\npressure and re-fill, pressure finally being applied to the real cover,\r\nwhich may then be tacked down. A box of the size I have mentioned, when\r\nfilled, should contain about 400 lb. of tobacco, and thus packed, will\r\nkeep for years.”\r\n\r\nAnother planter considers that parcels of “less than 1500 lb. may be\r\ncarried to market almost in any way; but more than that should be\r\n‘prized’ in hogsheads. Several farmers might combine their crops for\r\nprizing. As to the size, form, and materials of the hogsheads. In\r\nVirginia, the size of the hogsheads is prescribed by law. They must be\r\nmade of seasoned pine or poplar. They must be 4 feet 6 inches long; 3\r\nfeet 6 inches in diameter, at one end, and 3 feet 4 inches at the other.\r\nThis difference of diameter is to allow the tobacco to be inspected.\r\nThis may be something new to persons of the North, therefore I will\r\nexplain the mode of inspecting tobacco in the hogshead. An inspector is\r\nappointed by law to inspect or examine the tobacco prized in hogsheads.\r\nHis first step is, to place the hogshead big end upward. He then removes\r\nthe lining, and takes out the head. He next inverts the position of the\r\nhogshead, that is, puts the little end up, and raises it entirely from\r\nthe tobacco. The mass of prized tobacco stands before him without a\r\ncovering. The outside may be all right, but his sworn duty is to examine\r\nit through and through, as well as round and round. For this purpose he\r\ndrives an iron bar to the middle, near the top of the mass, prises up\r\nand takes out a handful of bundles. He repeats that operation on two\r\nother points of the mass. He then inspects or examines the parcels\r\nextracted, and rates the whole hogshead according to their quality. The\r\nhogshead is replaced and made secure. The hogsheads and the samples\r\ntaken from them bear corresponding marks, and the former is sold by the\r\nlatter. The staves of the hogshead must not be wider than 5, nor\r\nnarrower than 3 inches, ⅝ inch thick, and dressed on the inside. The\r\nheading must be seasoned pine or poplar, and 1 inch thick, with 8 hoops.\r\nSuch a hogshead will well answer in other States as well as in Virginia.\r\n\r\n“Weigh out, say 300 lb. It takes two hands to do this work, one inside\r\nthe hogshead and the other out. One is called the ‘packer,’ the other\r\nthe ‘waiter.’ The packer so arranges the bundles, in placing them, as to\r\nmake 4 courses in one layer. Repeat the layers until the 300 lb. are\r\npacked. The weight (lever-power) is then applied. After 6 hours, put in\r\n200 lb. more and apply the weight; 6 hours, and so on, until 1300–1500\r\nlb. have been put in. The softer the tobacco, the more of it can be put\r\nin a hogshead. If the tobacco is of the first quality, 1500 lb. is\r\nenough. But if lower qualities, 1800 lb. can be put in. The finer the\r\nquality the less weight it can bear without injury; and _vice versâ_.\r\nHaving prized the crop, it is ready for market.”\r\n\r\nAccording to Pursley, a hogshead “4 feet in length, and 3 feet in\r\ndiameter, is the medium size; 1000 lb. is considered a full hogshead;\r\nbut one of the above dimensions can hold 1500 lb. by hard pressing; but\r\nthis blackens the tobacco, and injures the sale of it. Packing in the\r\nhogshead is done by first laying a course or layer of bundles straight\r\nacross the bottom, keeping the butts even and close together; then fill\r\nup on each side of the centre course, placing the butts against the\r\nstaves; then the butts of the hands that lie against the hogshead should\r\nbe covered up with 2 or 3 others, pressed closely down. The next centre\r\ncourse should be laid across the first, and done in the same manner as\r\nbefore, and so on, crossing each course in succession, until the\r\nhogshead is two-thirds full; when the press should be applied till the\r\ntobacco is pressed down to within 1½ foot of the bottom of the hogshead.\r\nThe press should remain on an hour or more, in order that the tobacco\r\nmay settle together; then the press should be raised, and the packing\r\nresumed as before, till the tobacco is within 1½ foot of the top; then\r\nthe press should again be applied till the tobacco is pressed half-way\r\ndown the hogshead; the same proportion should be observed until the\r\nhogshead is full. Then put the head in, and it is ready for market.”\r\n\r\nPerry Hull would have packing-cases “made of cheap pine lumber, 3 feet 8\r\ninches long by 2 feet 6 inches wide and high, outside measurement; they\r\nshould be made tight and strong; there should be corner-pieces nailed in\r\n1½ inch square, nailing to them well from both ways. The tobacco is\r\npacked in, with the butts towards each end; taking hold of the butt with\r\none hand, the tip with the other, and giving the hank a slight twist,\r\nlay it in the case in that position. A lever or screw can be used to do\r\nthe pressing, whichever is the most convenient. From 360 lb. to 380 is\r\nthe proper weight for packing; though if the tobacco is very dry, 400\r\nlb. will probably not sweat too hard; and if quite wet (which it never\r\nshould be), 350 may.\r\n\r\n“After being packed, the tobacco should never be kept in a damp cellar;\r\na good tight barn or other outbuilding, where the cases can stand on a\r\nfloor, is the best place. The crop usually passes from the hands of\r\ngrowers, into those of speculators and dealers, before the sweating\r\nseason. The first symptoms of sweating appear about as soon as settled\r\nwarm weather comes, usually the fore part of May; it then commences to\r\ngrow warm, and ‘wet’ to appearance, which increases for about 3 weeks,\r\nwhen it reaches its culminating point and commences to cool off. One\r\nunaccustomed to the crop, upon examining it at this period, would be\r\nsure to think it was rotting, but if not too damp when packed, there is\r\nno danger. Sometimes, if a case is known to be too wet, the lids can be\r\nstarted, to give a little vent to the steam and gases which are\r\ngenerated, and this is about all that can be done for it; and it is far\r\nsafer to see that the proper condition is secured before packing, than\r\nto do even this. The weight will commence to decrease about as soon as\r\nthe heat commences, and it has been ascertained by weighing at the\r\nvarious stages, that more than half of the shrinkage is accomplished by\r\nthe time that the sweat has reached its culminating point. About 10 per\r\ncent. is allowed for the shrinkage of a crop, in just the right state\r\nwhen packed; if wetter, it will shrink as high as 12–13 per cent., and\r\nif very dry, it may shrink less than 10 per cent. The different grades\r\nusually bring about the following prices: Wrappers, 14 cents per lb.;\r\nSeconds, 7–8 cents; Fillers, 3–4 cents. The proportion of the different\r\ngrades in a good crop should be, Wrappers, three-fifths, and Seconds and\r\nFillers, each one-fifth.”\r\n\r\nJudson Popenoe thinks boxes “should be made 30 inches square by 42\r\ninches in length outside; saw the end-boards 28 inches long, nail them\r\nto two 1¼-inch square slats so that the head will be 28 inches square;\r\nwhen two heads are made, nail the sides of the box to the heads so as to\r\ncome even with the outside of the head, the sides being 28 inches wide;\r\nthen nail the bottom on firmly; the top can be nailed slightly until\r\nafter the tobacco is packed, when it can be nailed firm. Set your box by\r\nthe side of the bulk, and let one hand get in the box and another pass\r\nthe tobacco to him, one hand at a time, taking care not to shake it out,\r\nbut put in the box as it comes from bulk, with the butt of the hand next\r\nthe end of the box. Place close and press with the knee firmly; lay\r\nalternate courses at each end, and if the tobacco is not long enough to\r\nlap sufficiently to fill the centre, put a few hands crosswise in the\r\ncentre. When the box is full, place it under a lever; have a follower,\r\nwhich is a cover made of inch boards, nailed to two pieces of scantling\r\nand made to fit inside of the box; lay this on the tobacco, and build\r\nwith blocks of scantling on it of a sufficient height for the lever to\r\nbe clear of the box when pressed. Press down firmly with a strong lever,\r\nand, while kneeing in another box full, let the lever remain, so that\r\nthe tobacco gets set in the box. When ready, take the lever off and fill\r\nup as before, about 6 inches higher than the box; press it below the top\r\nof the box, take off your lever and nail on the top as quickly as\r\npossible. Some use tobacco-presses for packing, which are perhaps more\r\nconvenient; they are of various patterns, but a lever saves the expense\r\nof a press and is in the reach of all. If tobacco is sold at the shed,\r\nit should be sold before packing, being easier examined in bulk than\r\nbox.”\r\n\r\nMitjen is of opinion that, “except in cases where the extraordinary size\r\nof the leaves will not permit it, all the bales should be made up of 80\r\n‘_manojos_’; but in the former case 60 of the first classes of the first\r\nquality will be sufficient. The fixed number of 80 _manojos_ is\r\nconvenient for making calculations. We have already said that the day\r\nfollowing that on which the _manojos_ were tied up, they should be\r\npacked in bales, so as not to allow them time to dry too much. Bearing\r\nthis in mind, the dyeing and tying up of the _manojos_ should not be\r\ncommenced until there is a sufficient quantity of assorted leaves to\r\nmake a bale or bales; should there be a surplus of _manojos_ after the\r\nbales are made up, they should be kept protected from the air, until\r\nanother set of bales is about to be made up.\r\n\r\n“We do not think it is necessary to further explain the manner of\r\nplacing the _yaguas_, in order to make the bales, but it is expedient to\r\nstate that 8 layers of _manojos_ should not be put in one bale, because\r\nit makes a bad shape, and the tierces or bales appear much smaller than\r\nthey really are. The bales should be made of 2 layers, having the heads\r\nof the _manojos_ placed towards the outside. When the first layer of one\r\nof the heads of the bale is placed, the heads of the other layer should\r\nbe so arranged that they will be about half-way over the points of the\r\nothers; and if the tobacco is very small, to each row of _manojos_ may\r\nbe laid crossways, two _manojos_ with their heads touching the _yaguas_,\r\nso that the tobacco placed in the bale may form a compact even mass,\r\nimpervious to the air. The same should be done in the other rows, care\r\nbeing taken that the bale is made somewhat thicker in the middle, and\r\nnever have a hollow there,—a sure sign of loose packing,—and into which\r\nthe air finds its way, preventing fermentation, proper curing, as well\r\nas aroma—the tobacco becoming dry too soon. After the bales are tied up,\r\nthey should be placed in the sun or wind until the humidity of the\r\n_yagua_ is dry. They should then be placed on boards in the storehouse,\r\nputting them two and two, one on the other; and after eight days they\r\nshould be moved, placing them below those which had been above, so that\r\nthey may ferment and be equally pressed.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 13.]\r\n\r\nFor pressing tobacco into the hogshead, Hudson suggests that “a hole be\r\nmortised in a tree, in which the end of the lever can be inserted,\r\npassing over the hogshead, and working by a tree or post, in which\r\nshould be pins at intervals of 8–10 inches, by which a small lever may\r\nbe used to force the first lever down on the tobacco; 50–100 lb. may be\r\nplaced in the hogshead and firmly pressed a few hours, and as much added\r\nagain, and so on. Fig. 13 will serve to represent the manner in which\r\nthe hands (or ties) may be placed in the hogshead—filling the middle\r\nfirst, then the outer edges—placing the tops toward the centre, and\r\nobserving to keep the centre and edges full.”\r\n\r\n_Improving._—It is sometimes the custom to subject the tobacco-leaves to\r\nsome sort of improvement. There is no doubt that, by proper application\r\nof ingredients, the value of tobacco may be much enhanced. The most\r\ncostly tobacco often commands a high price, not so much on account of\r\nits inherent flavour, as from that given to it artificially. In most\r\ninstances, the best course to be adopted is to leave the improvement of\r\nthe leaves to the manufacturer. Many ingredients are employed to improve\r\nsmoking-tobacco. They tend:—1, to make the tobacco more elastic and\r\nflexible; 2, to remove the coarse flavour; 3, to add a particular\r\nflavour; 4, to improve the burning quality; 5, to improve the colour. To\r\nmake the tobacco more flexible and pliant, the leaves are macerated in,\r\nor sprinkled with, a solution of sugar. In hot countries, this process\r\nis often necessary, to give tobacco such an elasticity as to fit it for\r\nhandling, especially when intended for wrappers. To remove the coarse\r\nflavour, it is often macerated in water, or in very dilute hydrochloric\r\nacid. In Holland, 4–8 oz. of hydrochloric acid, diluted with 25–30\r\nmeasures of water, is applied to 100 lb. of tobacco. The coarser the\r\nflavour of the tobacco, the stronger is the solution used. The time of\r\nmaceration varies between ½ and 1 hour. Sometimes tobacco is steeped in\r\na mixture of sugar solution and diluted hydrochloric acid. To extract\r\nthe fatty matter, it is macerated in alcohol or spirit of wine. To give\r\na fine flavour, numerous substances are employed, some of which are kept\r\nsecret. The following ingredients are mostly in use:—Water, cognac,\r\nvanilla, sugar, rose-wood, cassia, clove, benzoin, citron oil, rose-wood\r\noil, amber, thyme, lavender, raisins, sassafras-wood, saltpetre, orange,\r\nand many others. The burning quality is improved by macerating in or\r\nsprinkling with solutions of carbonate of potash, acetate of potash,\r\nacetate of lime, or saltpetre, &c. Badly-burning cigars inserted for a\r\nmoment in such solutions are much improved. Tobacco treated with acetate\r\nof lime yields a very white ash. The colour is sometimes improved by\r\nfumigating the leaves with sulphur, and by the application of ochre and\r\nsaffron.\r\n\r\nAlthough it may be said that fine tobaccos generally do not require any\r\nimpregnation with foreign matter for the sake of flavour, yet the\r\nmanufacturer frequently endeavours to give the leaf a particular aroma.\r\nAn inferior tobacco, however, which often would not find a market, is\r\nsometimes so much improved by artificial means, as to compete\r\nsuccessfully with the genuine fine article. It is said that in Germany\r\nindigenous tobacco is often so much “improved” that the cigars made from\r\nit, after being covered with a fine tobacco leaf, are sold as genuine\r\nHavanas. A special preparation of tobacco for snuff is seldom attempted\r\nby the cultivator. With reference to the preparation of tobacco for\r\nexport, the sorting of the leaf is of the utmost importance; only first\r\nand second sorts should be exported. It would be well to remove the\r\nmidribs, whereby the cost of transport and customs duty would be greatly\r\nreduced.\r\n\r\nThe value of a cigar depends, not only on the intrinsic value of the\r\nleaf, but to a great extent on the mode of manufacture. Thus, the raw\r\nmaterial may be of good quality, but if the maker does not classify the\r\nleaves properly, or if he rolls his cigars too hard, which must vary\r\naccording to the qualities of the leaves, the cigar will burn badly. The\r\nbest-burning leaves must always be used for wrappers. If this should be\r\nneglected, the inside of the cigar burns faster than the covering, the\r\nair has no access to the burning parts, and the empyreumatical\r\nsubstances are volatilized without being decomposed. Such cigars\r\ntherefore make much smoke, and smell badly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER IV.\r\n                        PRODUCTION AND COMMERCE.\r\n\r\n\r\nDetails concerning the different modes of cultivating and curing, and of\r\nthe extent of the production and commerce in tobacco in the various\r\ncountries, will best be given in the alphabetical order of the\r\ncountries.\r\n\r\n_Afghanistan._—The tobacco grown at Kandahar is celebrated in all the\r\nneighbouring states for its mild and agreeable flavour, and is largely\r\nexported to Hindustan and Bokhara. Three kinds are grown,\r\nviz.:—Kandahari, Balkhi, and Mansurabadi. Of these, the last named is\r\nthe most esteemed, and fetches the highest price, viz. 6 lb. for\r\n2_s._-4_s._ The Kandahari sells for a little less than half this price,\r\nand the Balkhi for a little more. The Mansurabadi is not much exported,\r\nbeing mostly consumed in the country. The cultivation is conducted with\r\ngreat care, and the same plants yield two crops of leaves in the year.\r\nOf these, the first, which is called _sargul_, is the best, the leaves\r\nhaving a mild and sweet flavour; it is mostly consumed by the wealthy\r\nclasses, or exported. The second crop is called _mundhai_: the leaves\r\nhave a tough and fibrous texture, and a strong acrid taste; it is\r\nusually smoked by the poor people, and is also made into snuff. The\r\nplants are raised from seed in small beds, prepared for the purpose by\r\ncareful manuring with wood-ashes and stable-refuse mixed together. From\r\nthese nurseries, the young plants are transplanted into the fields,\r\npreviously prepared for their reception, the earth being laid out in\r\nregular ridges and furrows. The plants are fixed into the sides of these\r\nlittle ridges, and watered by means of the intervening furrows. Often\r\nthe young plants, packed in moist clay, and bound up in straw, are\r\nconveyed to distant parts of the country; but the produce of these, it\r\nis said, does not equal that of the plants reared at Kandahar. About six\r\nweeks after transplanting, that is, about May-June, the first crop is\r\nreaped, the whole plant being cut away about 6 inches from the ground,\r\nand only some 5 or 6 of the lowest leaves being left. Each plant, as\r\ncut, is laid on the ridge, and here each side is alternately exposed for\r\na night and a day to the effects of the dew and sun, by which their\r\ngreen colour becomes brown. After this, they are collected in large\r\nheaps in a corner of the field, and covered over with mats, or a layer\r\nof straw, &c., and allowed to remain so for 8–10 days, during which the\r\nstems shrivel, and give up their moisture to the leaves. At the end of\r\nthis time, the heaps are conveyed away into the villages, where the\r\nstalks are separated from the leaves, the latter are then dried in the\r\nshade and tightly packed in bundles about 14 inches square, and in this\r\nshape are sold by the grower. After the first crop is gathered, the\r\nground is turned with a spade, well manured, and freely irrigated. In\r\ndue course, the old stems shoot up and produce fresh leaves, and in six\r\nweeks or two months, the second crop is cut. Sometimes, though seldom, a\r\nthird crop is realized, but the quality of this tobacco is very\r\ninferior, and it is only fit for making snuff.\r\n\r\n_Africa._—The tobacco-plant extends throughout Central and East Africa,\r\nwherever the equinoctial rains fall. It is cultivated to some extent in\r\nthe Bondei of Usambara, but seems to be the special product of the\r\nHandei district, whence considerable quantities are sent to Pangani for\r\nexport. Usambara also exports to Zanzibar stiff, thin, round cakes,\r\nwhich have been pounded in wooden mortars, and neatly packed in\r\nplaintain-leaves. It is dark and well-flavoured. The Cape of Good Hope,\r\nin 1865, had 933 _morgen_ (of 2·116 acres) under tobacco, yielding\r\n1,632,746 lb.; in 1875, 1243 _morgen_ afforded 3,060,241 lb. Tobacco is\r\ngrown considerably in Oudtshorn and other districts of the Cape Colony,\r\nand on the warmer farms in the Transvaal, but to the greatest extent on\r\nthe coast. The supply is already sufficient for local demands, and\r\ntobacco promises to become a staple of South African agricultural\r\nindustry.\r\n\r\nA recent writer on this portion of the British colonies says, “tobacco,\r\nthough cultivated as an article of commerce for export, has not met with\r\nmuch success, as the passion for the weed has become deeply rooted in\r\nthe natives of the coast and interior, so that it is cultivated by them\r\nin many parts of the province for their own consumption, and forms a\r\nregular article of sale and barter amongst themselves.” The tobacco leaf\r\nis dried very carelessly by the natives, and is made up in a peculiar\r\nway, as follows:—It is first plaited, and when the plait has reached a\r\nlength of 3–4 feet, it is wound up in the form of a spiral. Gradually\r\ndrying in this shape, it preserves its form without any binding, and it\r\nis unwound and cut off in short pieces when required for use or sale.\r\nThis mode of preparation is invariable among the Makua and Yao, between\r\nthe Roouma and Zambesi. Consul O’Neill says that “were the natives\r\ninstructed in some simple method of drying and pressing the leaf, the\r\nvaluable product would be probably brought down by them in considerable\r\nquantities, affording, as it would do, a larger margin for profit than\r\ndoes the culture of oil seeds, and it might become a regular article of\r\ncolonial manufacture and export.”\r\n\r\nTobacco-growing is a very important industry in Algeria. The culture and\r\nmanufacture are quite free, but the French Government buys all the best\r\nproduce, for manufacture and sale by the State factory in Paris. The\r\ncultivation continues to increase, and is highly remunerative where the\r\nland is capable of irrigation. In 1876–7, the 1889 Europeans engaged in\r\nit cultivated 2471 _hectares_ (of 2½ acres), and produced 2,782,500\r\n_kilo._ (of 2·2 lb.); the 8021 natives cultivated 4154 _hectares_, which\r\nyielded 1,889,124 _kilo._ The year 1877–8 was less favourable, and the\r\narea decreased by 425 _hectares_. Still worse results were expected in\r\n1878–9, owing to scarcity of water. The kind most grown is called\r\n_chebli_. The produce per _hectare_ of fine and _chebli_ is estimated at\r\n6–8 _quintals_; the other kinds give 10–12. The exports in 1877 and 1878\r\nrespectively were as follows:—Manufactured, 121,090 _kilo._, and 124,117\r\n_kilo._; unmanufactured, 3,445,441 _kilo._ and 1,509,266 _kilo._ In\r\n1879, 1087 Europeans planted 3180 _hectares_, and gathered 1,226,181\r\n_kilo._; 11,079 natives planted 6584 _hectares_, and produced 1,384,802\r\n_kilo._; the exports were 2,481,218 _kilo._ unmanufactured, and 146,345\r\n_kilo._ manufactured.\r\n\r\nThe figures for 1883 were:—1240 European planters cultivated 2278\r\n_hectares_ and produced 2,250,671 _kilo._, whilst 8735 native planters\r\ncultivated 6416 _hectares_ and produced 2,977,067 _kilo._, the total\r\nproduct being 5,227,738 _kilo._ This does not differ to any great extent\r\nfrom the result of the previous year. Tobacco is capable of being\r\nproduced in much greater quantity, says the British Consul, but the\r\nmarket is limited. The colonists themselves and the Government appear to\r\nbe the only purchasers.\r\n\r\n_Australia._—In the year ending 31st March, 1879, New South Wales had\r\n835 acres under tobacco, and the crop amounted to 7932 cwt. In the same\r\nyear, Victoria cultivated 1936 acres, which yielded 15,662 cwt., valued\r\nat 43,853_l._ Queensland grew 36 acres of tobacco in 1879.\r\n\r\n_Austro-Hungary._—The manufacture and sale of tobacco is a Government\r\nmonopoly in the Austro-Hungarian empire, and the revenue thus derived is\r\nthe most lucrative item of the indirect income of the State. The only\r\ntobacco-growing provinces of Austria are Galicia and Bukowina, producing\r\nabout 4 million _kilo._ from 2900 _hectares_; and South Tyrol, where 290\r\n_hectares_ yield almost 4 million _kilo._ of green tobacco. The\r\nrespective approximate values of the two products are 18⅓ _florin_ (of\r\n1_s._ 11½_d._) and 4⅔ _florin_ per 100 _kilo._ The chief supplies are\r\nfurnished by Hungary, which was once so noted for its tobacco, but the\r\nindustry is now completely crippled by the fiscal regulations. The area\r\n(in acres) under cultivation fluctuates remarkably; in 1860, it was\r\n679¼; in 1865, 68,141; in 1869, 843¾; in 1875, 26,817; in 1879, 7316.\r\nThe total areas (in acres) under cultivation in the whole empire in\r\n1876, 1877, and 1878 respectively were, 144,493, 148,126, 143,447; the\r\nyields in _kilo._, 46,033,163, 44,164,038, 40,978,540; and the yield (in\r\n_kilo._) per _joch_ (of 1·43 acre), 445, 426, 408. Fiume, in 1877,\r\nexported by sea 2862 cwt. of manufactured tobacco; and by land, 31,200\r\ncwt. of leaf, and 53,712 cwt. of manufactured. In 1879, it shipped 9900\r\n_kilo._ of leaf tobacco direct to England. In 1883, the tobacco harvest\r\nwas 26,560 metrical centners (about equivalent to cwts.), being 1595 in\r\nadvance of 1882. The total exports of raw tobacco were 55,842 metrical\r\ncentners in 1883, and 74,475 in 1884. The port of Fiume shipped 613 tons\r\nof tobacco leaf in 1883, of which 189,300 _kilo._ value 75,720 florins,\r\nwent to Gibraltar. In 1884, the shipments from Fiume were 1673 tons.\r\n\r\n_Borneo._—Tobacco is grown in small quantities by the Dyaks and people\r\nof Bruni; but they are unskilful in its manufacture, though the flavour\r\nof the product of Bruni is much esteemed by Europeans. Under skilful\r\nmanagement, and by introducing a better kind if necessary, it might\r\nbecome as profitable to this island as it now is to the neighbouring\r\nones of the Philippines, Java, &c. The Dyaks might be more readily\r\ninduced to cultivate this plant, the nature of which they know, than\r\nplants which are strange to them. More recently it is announced that\r\nplantations have been commenced in British North Borneo, and samples of\r\nthe leaf sent to Europe have been favourably reported on. The exports\r\nfrom Sarawak in 1884 were valued at 2020 dollars to foreign ports, and\r\n34,257 dollars in coasting vessels, making a total of 36,277 dollars. In\r\nthe same year, British North Borneo shipped 2113 dollars’ worth; and\r\nSandakan, 1537 dollars’ worth.\r\n\r\n_Bourbon._—Efforts are being made to successfully introduce tobacco into\r\nthe rotation of crops on the sugar estates, with the object of supplying\r\nthe article to the French _régie_ or Government monopoly, which buys\r\nannually upwards of 40 million francs’ worth of tobacco in the islands\r\nof Cuba, Java, and other colonies. The results hitherto obtained are not\r\nunsatisfactory, and this article may shortly acquire importance among\r\nBourbon products. The exports in 1884 were 10,185 _kilo._, value 61,110\r\n_fr._\r\n\r\n_Brazil._—In Brazil, tobacco is chiefly cultivated in the provinces of\r\nBahia, Minas, Sao Paulo, and Para. The town of Purificaçao, in Bahia, is\r\nthe centre of an important district. The cultivation is increasing, and\r\ngreater care is being taken in the preparation. The common up-country\r\nmethod is to pick the leaves from the stalks, dry them under the\r\nhut-roofs, remove the midribs, and spread them in superposed layers,\r\namounting to 2–8 lb., for rolling together and binding with bark strips.\r\nThese rolls are bound very tightly with cord, and left for several days,\r\nwhen the cord is replaced by strips of _jacitára_, the split stem of a\r\nclimbing palm (_Desmoncus sp. div._), and have a stick-like form 1½ inch\r\nin diameter. They are sold in _masas_ of 4–6 feet in length, but the\r\ntobacco is not considered good till it has fermented for 5–6 months,\r\nwhen it is hard and black, and shaved off as required for pipes,\r\ncigarettes, and cigars, the last made with wrappers of _tauari_ bark\r\n(_Couratari guianensis_). The Tapajos tobacco is considered the finest\r\nin the Amazon valley. The export of tobacco from Bahia in 1877–8 was\r\n17,272,678 _kilo._, and in 1878–9, 18,149,201 _kilo._, almost the whole\r\nbeing to Germany. Santos, in 1878–9, shipped 381,310 _kilo._ Bahia sends\r\naway immense numbers of cigars coastwise. Maceio exported 4336_l._ worth\r\nin 1876, but none in 1879.\r\n\r\nSome interesting particulars are given in the last report of the United\r\nStates Consul-General at Rio de Janeiro, as to the cultivation and\r\nmanufacture of tobacco in Brazil. It appears that the cultivation began\r\nabout the year 1600, in the province of Bahia, and from thence extended\r\nto all the other districts along the coast. Among the localities\r\nearliest known for their tobacco production was the lake district of\r\nPernambuco, now the province of Alagoas, where an excellent quality was\r\nproduced, which commanded very high prices. During the following century\r\nthe cultivation increased so rapidly in Alagoas and Bahia, that at the\r\ncommencement of the succeeding century, the average annual export had\r\nreached 2857 tons from the latter, and 285 tons from the former\r\nprovince. The earliest export statistics available for the whole empire,\r\nare for the year 1839–40, in which the export amounted to 295,966\r\n_arrobas_, the _arroba_ being equivalent to about 32 lb.; and the value\r\nexceeded 65,000_l._ For the next thirteen years, the exports averaged\r\n8,000,000 lb. annually, with a value steadily increasing. During each of\r\nthe years 1853–55, the amount exported was 22,000,000 lb., of the total\r\nvalue each year of 200,000_l._ In 1879–80, the export was 50,000,000\r\nlb., of the value 659,000_l._; in 1880–81, 44,000,000 lb., of the value\r\nof 650,000_l._, and in 1881–82, 52,000,000 lb., of the value of\r\n680,000_l._ Though the principal tobacco-producing province of the\r\nempire is Bahia, tobacco of good quality is grown in every part of\r\nBrazil, from the Amazon to the Rio Grande frontier. Some localities in\r\nthe province of Amazonas have long been known for the excellent quality\r\nof their tobacco, while in the Rio market one of the brands most\r\nesteemed comes from the province of Goyaz. The local consumption of\r\ntobacco is very great, and principally in smoking. Bahia tobacco used to\r\nbe largely exported in rolls, weighing 8 _arrobas_, or 256 lb. each; of\r\nlate years, however, large quantities of the leaves in bales are\r\nexported to Hamburg. Cigar factories are established in all large cities\r\nthroughout the tobacco-growing regions, which give employment to a large\r\nnumber of men, women, and children. The methods employed in the\r\ncultivation and preparation of the plant are very much the same as they\r\nwere nearly 200 years ago. The labour employed is that of slaves, to\r\nwhom are assigned special descriptions of work. In former times curing\r\ntobacco in rolls required much constant labour, the ropes composing each\r\nroll being unwound, twisted, and re-wound during a period varying from\r\n10 to 15 days. The Brazilian tobacco is generally characterized by its\r\nstrength and dark colour, particularly in Bahia. In that province the\r\npractice is to manure heavily, which occasions a very rank growth and\r\nstrong flavour. In Minas Geraes the tobacco is somewhat milder, and some\r\nadvance has lately been made in a few localities towards improved\r\nprocesses of curing. This seed may be germinated in any season of the\r\nyear, but the months of June, July, and August are generally preferred\r\nfor planting, because germination and transplanting are brought into or\r\nnear the rainy season. Tobacco plants planted in this season are\r\nconsidered the best growers, and produce the largest leaves. Those,\r\nhowever, which are germinated in the dry season, and sustained by\r\nirrigation, grow with greater vigour, and possess a finer aroma. The\r\nland selected for the plants is cleared, and the surface worked with the\r\nhoe, after which it is marked off into parallel rows about 3 feet apart,\r\naccording to locality and the size of the mature plants. In\r\ntransplanting, the young plants are set from 2 to 3 feet apart, and are\r\nmanured heavily in the pits opened for them. Great care is necessary for\r\na time to protect the shoots from the sun, and to irrigate plentifully\r\nwhen the transplanting occurs in a dry season. The work of cultivation\r\nand keeping down the weeds is performed entirely with the hoe, and only\r\ntwo or three times during the season. In gathering in the crops,\r\nplanters wait until the plants are fully matured, this being determined\r\nby doubling and breaking one of the top leaves. In Bahia and other\r\nBrazilian provinces the lower leaf is often picked by itself, and in a\r\nfew days the next, and so on as long as the plant will develop the lower\r\nleaves into what is classed first quality. These leaves are hung up two\r\nand two, under cover and across poles, 24 hours after picking and\r\nsweating. When it is intended to twist the leaves into ropes, they are\r\nleft hanging about 2 days, when they are taken down, carefully freed\r\nfrom the heavy parts of the midrib, doubled in halves, and laid away for\r\nthe rope twister. This operation requires considerable dexterity, and is\r\ngenerally entrusted to the best slave on the plantation. The operation\r\nrequires a rude windlass, which is slowly turned in winding the rope,\r\nwhich is twisted by hand. A boy is usually employed entirely to hand\r\nleaves to the twister. These ropes are unwound and re-wound once or\r\ntwice a day, for a period of 10–15 days, according to the weather, and\r\nare twisted a little harder each time. In curing, the tobacco grows\r\ndarker and darker, until it becomes jet black. The juices exuding from\r\nthe rolls are carefully caught and preserved until the last winding,\r\nwhen, mixed with lard, syrup, and various aromatic herbs, they are used\r\nto pass the rope through, previous to the final winding. The last step\r\nis to cut the cured ropes in certain lengths, and to re-wind them upon\r\nlight wooden sticks, about 2 feet in length, the winding being very\r\ncompact and regular. The rolls are then covered with leather or strong\r\ncanvas, when they are ready for market. Formerly, these rolls were made\r\nto weigh 8 _arrobas_, or 256 lb., though rolls of 3 _arrobas_ were made\r\nfor the home markets. At the present day the weights vary according to\r\nthe locality. The large exportation of tobacco in leaf has considerably\r\nchanged the character of tobacco-growing in Bahia, the process of curing\r\nand packing the leaf being simpler than the old process of manufacturing\r\n_rolos_. Tobacco-growing is heavily protected and taxed in Brazil,\r\nnearly all the provinces imposing separate protective taxes, in addition\r\nto those imposed by the Government. Besides these, the municipalities\r\nare permitted to levy taxes on the article. The present export tax on\r\ntobacco, in Brazil, amounts to as much as 18 per cent.\r\n\r\nThe local market quotations are thus given:—\r\n\r\n                                    s. d. s. d.\r\n Patentes         6808–8170  _real_ (=12 2–14 7)   per 10 _kilo._ (= 22\r\n                                                  lb.)\r\n Santo Amaro, assorted                 3 7– 5 8      ”    ”\r\n Alagrinhas       2791–5106           (5 0– 8 2)     ”    ”\r\n São Felix        3745–4425          (6 8– 7 10½)    ”    ”\r\n\r\nThe Bahia export in 1883–4 was 15,644,010 _kilo._, value 400,246_l._\r\n\r\n_Canary Islands._—With the declining importance of cochineal,\r\ntobacco-growing is gaining ground, and the quality of the article has\r\nbeen much improved, while factories for drying and preparing the leaf\r\nhave been established in various localities. The exports for the year\r\n1883–4 were:—27 lb., value 8_l._, to France; 2268 cwt., value 9809_l._,\r\nto Spain; 1753 lb., value 375_l._, to Germany; and 939 lb., value\r\n189_l._, to West Coast of Africa.\r\n\r\n_China._—The chief tobacco-growing provinces of China are Chihli, Hopih,\r\nHoonan, Szechuen, and Shingking. The use of tobacco is wide-spread and\r\ncommon, and considerable local trade is carried on in it. The exports\r\nfrom Amoy were 2573 _piculs_ (of 133⅓ lb.), value 13,561_l._, in 1877;\r\nand 3994½ _piculs_, value 17,936_l._, in 1878. Wenchow exported 27¾\r\n_piculs_ of leaf in 1878, and 321⅓ in 1879. The exports and re-exports\r\nfrom Hankow in 1878 were 65,070¾ _piculs_ of leaf, and 46,241¾ of\r\nprepared. In 1879, Hankow exported and re-exported 63,180 _piculs_\r\nprepared, value 311,754_l._, and 58,094 of leaf, value 118,534_l._ There\r\nis an immense supply from the provinces, and the leaf is fine in colour,\r\ntexture, and fragrance, but though sent to America and England for\r\ncigar-making, the trade has not been remunerative. It is now used in\r\ncigarettes and various cut mixtures as “Turkish,” but when better known,\r\nwill be smoked on its own merits. Canton exported 1730¾ _piculs_ in\r\n1877, 1742¾ in 1878, and 2397 in 1879. The exports of leaf from Ningpo\r\nwere 407 _piculs_ in 1874, 571 in 1875, 211 in 1876, 530 in 1877, 378 in\r\n1878, and 165 in 1879. Kiungchow exported 449¼ _piculs_ of leaf in 1878;\r\nand 85½ _piculs_, value 136_l._, in 1879. Kiukiang exported 28,120½\r\n_piculs_ of leaf, value 35,678_l._, in 1878; and 14,659 of leaf, and 802\r\nof stalk, in 1879.\r\n\r\nChinkiang imported 13,328 _piculs_ of leaf, and 1914 of prepared, in\r\n1879. Macao receives tobacco from the Hokshan district, and prepares it\r\nfor exportation to Java, the Straits, and California, the annual export\r\nbeing about 10,000 _piculs_. The Newchwang imports of prepared native\r\ntobacco were 8052 _piculs_ in 1877, 8354 in 1878, and 6630 in 1879.\r\nShanghai, in 1879, imported 58,460 _piculs_ of native leaf, 79,081½ of\r\nprepared, and 1187½ of stalk; and exported and re-exported 31,541 of\r\nleaf, and 29,672¼ of prepared. Taiwan imported 3017¼ _piculs_ of\r\nprepared native in 1879. Tientsin exported 1047⅓ _piculs_ native tobacco\r\nin 1878, and 693½ in 1879. Tobacco is grown in the hilly districts near\r\nWuhu; the leaves are gathered in October, and sun-dried on wicker-work\r\nframes. The exports in 1879 were 597½ _piculs_ of leaf, and 742 of\r\nprepared.\r\n\r\n_Cochin-China._—The culture of tobacco is extending in Cochin-China, and\r\nit is even said that a considerable quantity is exported to China, but\r\nit improves little in quality. The area reported to be under tobacco\r\ncultivation in 1878 (including coffee) was 2361 acres.\r\n\r\n_Costa Rica._—The free cultivation of tobacco was stopped in January\r\n1884, and its free sale only permitted till December 31, 1885.\r\n\r\n_Ecuador._—The tobacco crop of Ecuador for 1879 was not so large as\r\nusual, owing to an unfavourable season. Esmeraldas, the most northerly\r\nport, and whence nearly all the tobacco shipments are made, despatched\r\nabout 3000 _quintals_ in 1879. Guayaquil exported 150 _quintals_ in\r\n1877, none in 1878, and 10 in 1879. In 1883, the exports from Guayaquil\r\nwere 1374 _quintals_, value 5496_l._; in 1884, only 96 _quintals_,\r\n192_l._\r\n\r\n_Fiji._—The Fiji Islands are well adapted to tobacco culture. The\r\nnatives produce a good deal, which nearly approaches the American leaf.\r\nWith careful curing, it would find a market in England. The native\r\nproduct is rolled, which prevents its being made into cigars. Samples of\r\nleaf-tobacco in hands, raised from foreign seeds, exhibited very unequal\r\nqualities, and a tendency to revert to American forms, the Havana\r\nreturning to the Virginian type. Cut up for smoking, they were deficient\r\nin flavour, but were considered satisfactory as a first experiment.\r\n\r\n_France._—The area occupied by tobacco in France in 1873 was 14,858\r\n_hectares_ (of 2½ acres), yielding at the rate of 12 _quintals_ (of 220½\r\nlb.). The amount of land authorized, to grow tobacco in Pas de Calais in\r\n1879 was 2100 acres, and the quantity furnished to the Government was\r\n3,659,636 lb., the prices (per _kilo._) paid by the Government being 1\r\n_fr._ 45_c._ for 1sts, 1 _fr._ 12_c._ for 2nds, 88_c._ for 3rds, and\r\n10–66_c._ for other inferior qualities. The number of plants grown per\r\nacre is about 17,000. The department Nord affords rather more than Pas\r\nde Calais.\r\n\r\nBy the Imperial decrees of December 29th, 1810, and January 12th, 1811,\r\nit was ordained that the purchase of tobacco in leaf and the fabrication\r\nand sale, whether wholesale or retail, of manufactures of tobacco,\r\nshould be exclusively confined to the Administration of Indirect Taxes\r\n(Régie des Droits Unis) in all the departments of France. At present the\r\nRégie has in operation 16 large manufactories, 27 “magasins de culture,”\r\nand 4 “magasins de transit.” It employs over 19,000 workpeople, of whom\r\nabout 80 per cent. are women and girls. The usual daily earnings are,\r\nfor men, from 2_s._ 7_d._ to 3_s._ 11_d._, and for women, from 1_s._\r\n2_d._ to 2_s._ 4_d._ For faithful or exemplary services, the workpeople\r\nreceive annually rewards, varying in amounts from 15_s._ to 20_l._ Mr.\r\nScidmore, the United States Consular Agent in Paris, gives the following\r\ndescription of the manner in which the operations of the Régie are\r\ncarried on. At the beginning of each year the Minister of Finance\r\ndesignates the number of hectares upon which, and the departments within\r\nwhich, the cultivation of tobacco may be undertaken during the following\r\nseason. The last ministerial decree upon this subject confines the\r\nprivilege to the departments of the Alpes Maritimes, Bouches du Rhône,\r\nDordogne, Gironde, Ille-et-Vilaine, Landes, Lot-et-Garonne,\r\nMeurthe-et-Moselle, Nord, Pas de Calais, Puy de Dôme, Hautes-Pyrénées,\r\nHaute-Saöne, Savoie, Haute Savoie, and Var. In the month of October or\r\nNovember, an agent of the Régie proceeds to the communes among which the\r\nprefects have apportioned the allotments, and receives the declaration\r\nof every proprietor desiring to profit by the authorization. A\r\nCommission, composed of the prefect, of the director of indirect taxes,\r\na superior agent of cultivation, a member of the council general, and of\r\na member of the council of the arrondissement, not being planters, then\r\nexamine the declarations, and admit, reduce, or reject them. After a\r\nplanter is accorded permission to cultivate, he is subjected to close\r\nofficial supervision, and to numerous stringent regulations concerning\r\ndetails as to the prohibition to sow any other seed than that furnished\r\nto him by the administration, the mode of planting, &c.; and, in\r\naddition to the surveillance as to these matters, two official\r\ninventories are taken of the growing crop—the first to ascertain the\r\nextent of land under cultivation and the number of plants, the second to\r\ndetermine the number of leaves for which the planter will be held\r\naccountable. When the tobacco has been gathered in a manner described by\r\nregulations of minute detail, the planter takes it to the magazine of\r\nthe Régie, where it is subjected to the inspection of a commission of\r\nfive disinterested experts, who separate the leaves into three portions,\r\naccording to quality; the planter is then paid for each portion in\r\naccordance with the tariff of prices promulgated by the Minister of\r\nFinance. Foreign tobacco is obtained through contract with private\r\nparties, after published proposals by the Minister of Finance through\r\nthe French Consular Corps abroad, and through a special government\r\nagency established at Havana. At present a little over one-third of the\r\ntobacco purchased by the Régie is of French growth; over one-half\r\nconsists of foreign leaf, mostly obtained from the United States, and\r\nthe remainder is made up by importations of cigars from Havana and\r\nManilla, and by cigarettes and miscellaneous productions of various\r\ncountries, and by custom-house seizures. The magazines distributed\r\nthroughout the country are of two sorts, “magasins de transit” for\r\nforeign tobacco, and “magasins de culture” for indigenous tobacco. In\r\nthe “magasins de transit” the foreign leaves have not to submit to any\r\nother manipulation than the sampling of packages, after which they are\r\nforwarded to the factories in such quantities as may be demanded. With\r\nthe indigenous tobacco the course is different; this when received from\r\nthe hands of the French grower is usually very imperfectly dried, and\r\nhas to be subjected to a curing process. After the bundles are\r\nthoroughly thrashed, they are put in heaps according to maturity, and\r\nfermented in a temperature as high as 30° to 40° Centigrade. This\r\nmaturation lasts from six to nine months, depending upon the locality,\r\nand the condition of the leaves as received, and is interrupted from\r\ntime to time by the operation of shaking and turning in order to prevent\r\ntoo great fermentation. When this fermentation is concluded, those\r\nleaves containing less than twenty per cent. of water are ready to be\r\npacked. At this point certain of the leaves undergo a stemming process;\r\nthey are then packed by hydraulic pressure in bales and hogsheads\r\nweighing from 400 to 500 _kilo._ each, and in this state they remain\r\nstored in the magazine for some months to acquire further ripeness. It\r\nis usually 15–18 months after they are gathered that the leaves are\r\nconsidered to be in a fit condition to be sent to the manufactory. Upon\r\narrival at the manufactory, the packages are sorted and emptied; the\r\nleaves are spread out in large bins or receive a preparatory wetting\r\nwith water containing 10 per cent. of sea salt, in order to produce\r\nflexibility and prevent powdering. This process occupies 24 hours. Then\r\nfollows the sorting according to quality, and the distribution to the\r\nvarious workrooms for composition.\r\n\r\nWhen intended for the manufacture of snuff, the leaves are put into\r\nmachines and chopped into strips of the width of a finger; they are then\r\nmoistened with pure water or tobacco juice of various strengths, the\r\nnecessary quantity and quality of which is determined by chemical\r\nanalysis. These strips are then piled up in masses containing from\r\n35,000 to 40,000 kilogrammes, in rooms where a high and even temperature\r\nis maintained by steam-pipes and ventilators. Here they remain to\r\nferment during a month or six weeks, when they are dried, ground into\r\npowder, and sifted. This powder then receives a wetting, is packed in\r\nstout wooden bins, in quantities ranging from 25,000 to 30,000 _kilo._,\r\nand so remain to ferment for several months. During the course of the\r\nfinal fermentation, the powder is tested and moved from one bin to\r\nanother from time to time, in order to ensure a successful issue of the\r\nprocess. When the samples taken from the bins indicate maturity, the\r\nsnuff is packed in barrels and casks, and is ready for the market. For\r\nthe manufacture of smoking-tobacco, the leaves, after the stemming\r\nprocess, receive their first moistening, which lasts 24 hours. They are\r\nthen neatly arranged, with their edges parallel, and are taken to the\r\nchopping machines; the machines in use at the Régie are capable of\r\nchopping 220 lb. per hour, the knives being renewed twice during that\r\ntime. The tobacco, on leaving the choppers, contains about 25 per cent.\r\nof humidity, and is immediately conveyed into one end of a revolving\r\ndrying cylinder, heated to a uniform temperature of 203° Fahrenheit,\r\nfrom the opposite end of which it issues, at the expiration of fifteen\r\nminutes, in a dried state and freed from albumen. It is then put through\r\na second cylinder, similar in construction to the last, but which\r\nsubjects the tobacco to a strong draught of cold air to eliminate all\r\ndust and heat. The tobacco is then packed in well-aired bins, where it\r\nremains from four to six weeks, after which it is carefully overhauled\r\nby hand to remove the pieces of stems and foreign matter that may have\r\nescaped notice in the previous operations. It is then put up in\r\npackages, varying in weight from 40 grammes upwards. These packages are\r\nsurrounded with a paper band, upon which are printed the Government tax\r\nstamp, the date of manufacture, the weight, the price, and the letter\r\n“H,” followed by figures. The last mark signifies the amount of humidity\r\ncontained in the tobacco at the time it was put into the packets. Consul\r\nScidmore says that in no instance since its inauguration has there been\r\na year without enormous profits to the tobacco monopoly in France, and\r\nin a table appended to his report, it appears that from the date of its\r\nfoundation (1811) to the end of 1878, the net total gain to the French\r\nGovernment amounted to 287,703,881_l._\r\n\r\nThe following table from a recent report shows that the consumption of\r\ntobacco in France has been steadily increasing:—\r\n\r\n             Year.

Ten departments only consume tobacco above the average,\r\nwhile 70 are actually below it. If all France smoked the same quantity\r\nas do the people of Nord, Haut-Rhin, and Pas de Calais, the consumption\r\nfor the whole country would be 73,286,174 _kilo._ instead of 31,000,000;\r\nand _vice versâ_ it would be only 6,265,968 _kilo._ if calculated\r\naccording to the average of Lozère, which is only at the rate of 171\r\n_grm._ per head.\r\n\r\nThe department of the Nord, in 1884, had 449 _hectares_ (of 2·47 acres)\r\nunder tobacco, the yield of which was 1,168,206 _kilo._\r\n\r\n_Germany._—The total area of land engaged in growing tobacco in Germany\r\nin 1878 was about 44,520 acres; nearly two-thirds of this total was\r\ndistributed among Rhenish Bavaria, Baden, S. Hesse, and Alsace-Lorraine.\r\nThe total consumption of tobacco in the German empire in that year was\r\n2,196,000 cwt. The home production was 596,776 cwt., the remainder being\r\nimported.\r\n\r\nThe aggregate area of land cultivated with tobacco in the States of the\r\nGerman Customs Union did not vary considerably during ten years, being\r\n21,509 _hectares_ in 1863, and 20,918 in 1872, to which must be added\r\nthe newly annexed provinces of Alsace and Lorraine, which bring up the\r\ntotal to 24,745 _hectares_. It appears that, with particular regard to\r\nthe year 1872, the cultivation was carried on in 4067 different\r\nlocalities, by 94,916 taxable growers, and by 83,675 smaller growers,\r\nwhose production, owing to its limited extent, was exempt from taxation.\r\nBy far the larger number were small growers, the area cultivated by each\r\nnot exceeding an average of 10 _ares_. In Prussia the aggregate of land\r\ncultivated during the year 1871 amounted to 5925 _hectares_, or 26 per\r\ncent. of the entire territory of the kingdom; the aggregate yield of the\r\nharvest in the same year was 198,890 _centners_. It appears that the\r\nextent of tobacco-growing land has, during the last fifty years, been\r\ngradually diminishing in Prussia, and that accordingly the expectations\r\nentertained in the beginning of that period of a great future\r\ndevelopment of this branch of agriculture have not been realized. The\r\nreasons for the gradual decline are considered to be, on the one hand,\r\nthe growing competition of the South German growers, and the increase in\r\nthe importations of American tobacco; on the other hand, the fact that\r\nthe cultivation of beetroot for sugar, and of potatoes for distilling\r\npurposes, has proved to be a more profitable business than tobacco\r\nproduction. It has, moreover, been found by many years’ experience, that\r\nwhilst the quality of the tobacco cultivated in most parts of Prussia is\r\nnot such as to enable the growers to compete successfully with the\r\nimporters of foreign, particularly North American sorts, the labour\r\nattending its cultivation and its preparation for the market, as well as\r\nthe uncertainty of only an average crop, are out of proportion, as a\r\nrule, to the average profits arising therefrom. The cultivation of the\r\nplant has consequently gradually “become restricted chiefly to those\r\ndistricts of the country where either the soil is peculiarly adapted for\r\nthe purpose, or where it is carried on for the private use of the\r\nproducer.\r\n\r\nIn Bavaria, as is well known, tobacco is cultivated very extensively,\r\nparticularly in the Palatinate and in Franconia, viz. the districts\r\naround Nuremberg and Erlangen. The area of land in 1871 was 4721\r\n_hectares_, which produced 144,153 _centners_. In Saxony but little\r\ntobacco is grown, the total area planted therewith in 1871 not having\r\nexceeded 6 _hectares_, upon which 130 _centners_ were produced. Although\r\nin parts of Wirtemberg the soil and climate are said to be very\r\nfavourable to the growth of the plant, the area of land cultivated is,\r\nupon the whole, a very limited one, and did not exceed 178 _hectares_.\r\nThe yield of the harvest is given at 5571 _centners_. In the year 1858\r\nthe extent of production in Wirtemberg is stated to have been four times\r\nas great as it is at present. The Grand Duchy of Baden has at all times\r\nbeen the chief tobacco-growing part of Germany, and as far back as the\r\nend of the seventeenth century special laws for regulating the\r\ncultivation, preparation, and warehousing of this article were in force.\r\nThe great importance accordingly attaching to this branch of agriculture\r\nand industry for so large a proportion of the inhabitants of Baden,\r\nrenders it but natural that any project of increasing the tobacco tax\r\nshould meet with very strong opposition amongst most classes of the\r\nGrand Duchy. The most prominent tobacco-growing districts of Baden are\r\nthose of Carlsruhe, Mannheim, Heidelberg, Badenburg, Schwitzingen, and\r\nLahr; the quality of the plant grown in these parts being a very\r\ninferior one. The produce of the districts mentioned is therefore\r\napplied chiefly to the manufacture of “cigar-wrappers,” and is exported\r\nin considerable quantities to Bremen, Hamburg, Switzerland, Holland, and\r\neven to America, for the use of the cigar-makers. The prices of the best\r\nkinds of Baden tobacco are consequently also, on an average, much higher\r\nthan those realized by other German growers. The area in Hesse was 979\r\n_hectares_, the chief district being around the town of Darmstadt; the\r\nproduction was 31,311 _centners_. The most prominent amongst the\r\nThuringian States as regards tobacco production, is the Duchy of\r\nSaxe-Menningen; the land cultivated in 1871 in all of them put together\r\nwas 202 _hectares_, the yield of the harvest in that year having been\r\n4806 _centners_. In the two German states of Mecklenburg, 6106\r\n_centners_ were raised from 165 _hectares_ of land. The most important\r\ndistrict is that of Neu-Brandenburg, in Mecklenburgh-Strelitz. Only a\r\nsmall extent of land, viz. 69 _hectares_, is used for tobacco in the\r\nDuchy of Brunswick, the same being situated near the town of Helmstadt;\r\nthe amount raised was 2391 _centners_.\r\n\r\nIn the recently acquired provinces of Alsace-Lorraine, tobacco\r\ncultivation has been extensively carried on for many years, more\r\nespecially in the country around Strasburg, Mülhausen, Schirmeck, and\r\nMünster, and to a smaller extent near Metz and Thionville. The aggregate\r\narea of land cultivated in 1871 in both provinces is given at 3159\r\n_hectares_, upon which 115,518 _centners_ of tobacco were raised.\r\nAccording to the statistics and information furnished by Consul Ward,\r\nthe quantity of tobacco produced in Germany in the year 1871 amounted to\r\n713,845 _centners_, the whole being estimated in value at 60,284,210\r\ndols., or about 9,042,613_l._ sterling.\r\n\r\nA Consular report of March 31, 1885, remarks that one of the most\r\nprominent branches of agriculture in Baden is that of tobacco, of which\r\nabout 300,000 to 350,000 cwt. annually are grown, whereof large\r\nquantities are exported. Owing to the comparatively high tax on\r\nproduction of 22½ marks per 50 _kilo._, the grower has been forced to\r\nseek a more rational system of cultivation, and a more careful treatment\r\nof the plant and the curing of the leaf. Government pays particular\r\nattention to this culture. A Commission has been appointed for the\r\npurpose of studying and investigating the treatment of tobacco in\r\nHolland, and the results are to be adopted and propagated, so far as the\r\nclimate admits.\r\n\r\nIt is very doubtful whether the labours of the Commission will greatly\r\ninfluence the farmers, who are of a very conservative disposition;\r\nmoreover, there is a greater obstacle to struggle against, namely, their\r\ndesire to increase the quantity of the production, and with it their\r\nincome, without regard to the question of deterioration of the quality\r\nof tobacco; the peasantry, like other classes, participates in the\r\ndesire to better its material condition.\r\n\r\nThe surface of land occupied by tobacco plantations represented in 1883\r\nfor the whole of the empire the considerable figure of 22,068\r\n_hectares_; this year a reduction is to be noted, as official reports\r\nbring the total to 21,108 _hectares_ only.\r\n\r\nThe Grand Duchy of Baden participated in the above figures with 7788\r\n_hectares_ for 1883, and 7647 _hectares_ for 1884.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding this difference, the result of the crop will not\r\nessentially be smaller (as regards the weight of the total), the new\r\nproduce proving heavier in weight and in substance. While in 1883 the\r\nhectare produced about 1900 _kilo._, it is supposed that for 1884 it\r\nwill yield from 1800 to 2000 _kilo._ These figures tend to prove that\r\nthe 1884 tobacco is richer in quality, and consequently more durable,\r\nand less capable of treatment than that of the preceding years; although\r\nthe quality is somewhat inferior to that of 1882 and 1883 it may fairly\r\nbe considered as good.\r\n\r\nThe subjoined remarks deal with the tobacco trade of Bremen. The number\r\nof casks of Kentucky tobacco sold in 1884 fell considerably below that\r\ndisposed of in 1883. This is explainable by the circumstance that lugs\r\nand cuttings were altogether wanting. The prices of leaf on the whole\r\nremained steady, except in October and November, when they soon regained\r\ntheir firmness through no more supplies from America being expected,\r\nowing to the continued demand for strong tobacco in that country.\r\nBusiness in Virginia tobacco also suffered from the want of inferior\r\nqualities. Prices, considered high from the beginning, showed even a\r\nrising tendency at the end of the season. Transactions in Maryland and\r\nscrubs exceeded the average of the last five years. Ohio and Bay\r\nsuffered, as hitherto, from the protection afforded to home growths.\r\nOperations in stems were, considering the depression in trade, not\r\nunsatisfactory.\r\n\r\nA good business was done in almost all descriptions of tobacco in\r\nserons, chests, bales, and baskets, and sales surpassed those of\r\nprevious years.\r\n\r\nThe subjoined table presents a comparison of the transactions in the\r\nvarious sorts of tobacco during the last two years:—\r\n\r\n ──────────────────┬──────────────────┬───────────────┬───────────────\r\n   Description of  │  Description of  │   Imports.    │    Sales.\r\n      Tobacco.     │     Packing.     │  1883.│  1884.│  1883.│  1884.\r\n ──────────────────┼──────────────────┼───────┼───────┼───────┼───────\r\n Kentucky          │Casks             │ 20,828│ 12,084│ 20,012│ 12,514\r\n Virginia          │ ”                │  3,937│  5,250│  4,848│  5,196\r\n Maryland          │ ”                │  4,929│  5,615│  4,579│  5,811\r\n Scrubs            │ ”                │    383│  1,363│    383│  1,027\r\n Ohio              │ ”                │    581│  1,155│    566│  1,174\r\n Bay               │ ”                │    101│    136│    234│    134\r\n Stems             │ ”                │  5,013│  7,332│  8,163│  5,403\r\n Havana            │Serons            │ 16,127│ 15,027│ 13,121│ 11,967\r\n Cuba and Yara     │ ”                │ 22,467│ 22,259│ 29,297│ 17,383\r\n St. Domingo       │ ”                │ 83,836│ 59,665│ 58,121│ 44,065\r\n Seed-leaf         │Chests            │ 17,070│ 18,723│ 77,000│ 18,203\r\n Porto Rico        │Bales             │  1,133│    300│  1,137│  2,210\r\n Esmeralda         │ ”                │    705│    549│    776│    599\r\n Columbia          │Serons and bales  │ 11,862│ 21,041│ 14,032│ 22,659\r\n Varnias           │Leaves and rolls  │    922│  2,065│  3,174│  2,065\r\n Brazil, in leaves │Bales             │131,982│185,061│139,397│189,246\r\n Paraguay          │ ”                │  2,672│  2,601│  2,879│  2,819\r\n Rio Grande        │ ”                │  4,571│     ..│ 10,199│  1,340\r\n Manilla           │ ”                │     50│     77│     21│    106\r\n Mexican           │ ”                │     ..│     10│     ..│     10\r\n Turkish and Greek │ ”                │  6,155│  6,825│  8,235│  8,105\r\n Other varieties   │ ”                │  1,496│  2,017│  1,441│  3,357\r\n ──────────────────┴──────────────────┴───────┴───────┴───────┴───────\r\n\r\nGood qualities of Havana fetched adequate prices. The demand for Cuba,\r\nYara, Carmen, and Domingo was brisk; Brazilian and Felix found ready\r\nbuyers, owing to the last good crop, the prices rising towards the close\r\nof the year. The stock of Porto Rico was realized at a low figure. In\r\nseed-leaf Pennsylvania plants were chiefly imported, and, being of a\r\ngood quality, were for the most part promptly disposed of. Much\r\ninclination was shown for Turkish tobacco, and the same remark applies\r\nto business in Paraguay, of which the supplies might have been greater.\r\nChinese tobacco, very brisk at first on account of its fine quality,\r\nlater on fell off again considerably.\r\n\r\nThe value of the tobacco consumed in Germany in 1878 is calculated to\r\nhave been 353 million marks, or 17,650,000_l._ sterling, the total\r\nreturn to the revenue being 26,383,966 marks, or 1,319,198_l._ The\r\nquantity consumed in that empire in the year is stated at 2,196,000\r\ncwt., or rather more than 100,000 tons. Of this quantity 582,600 cwt.,\r\nor upwards of 29,000 tons, were consumed in the form of cigars.\r\nReckoning a hundred cigars to a pound in weight, the number of cigars\r\nconsumed in Germany in 1878 would be upwards of seven thousand millions,\r\nwhich would give two cigars a day all the year round to ten million\r\nsmokers. But besides cigars the Germans smoked in the year 1,327,200\r\ncwt., or upwards of 60,000 tons of tobacco more or less manufactured. In\r\nthe form of snuff they took 160,600 cwt., or 8000 tons, in the course of\r\nthe year, while in the way of chewing-tobacco they limited themselves to\r\nthe moderate quantity of 14,200 cwt., or about 700 tons. Rather more\r\nthan one-third of the total weight of tobacco consumed was grown within\r\nthe limits of Germany, the quantity so produced in 1878 being 596,776\r\ncwt., while the imports amounted to 1,768,855 cwt. of tobacco leaves,\r\n4827 cwt. of roll tobacco, 14,170 cwt. of cigars, 8321 cwt. of stems for\r\nsnuffs, 513 cwt. of snuff, and 101 cwt. of chewing-tobacco. The total\r\narea of land engaged in growing the plant in 1878 was 18,016 _hectares_,\r\nor about 44,520 acres. Two-thirds of that quantity was grown in Rhenish\r\nBavaria, Baden, South Hesse, and Alsace-Lorraine, in which districts\r\n11,623 _hectares_ were employed in the cultivation of the plant.\r\n\r\n_Great Britain._—The proposal to re-establish tobacco culture in the\r\nUnited Kingdom has called for the following sensible article in the\r\n_Planters’ Gazette_.\r\n\r\n“The question of growing tobacco in the United Kingdom is not so simple\r\nas patriotic Irishmen and enthusiasts of acclimatization might think.\r\nTobacco has been classed, like tea and coffee, as among those\r\nnecessaries of life which could not be grown with any advantage in the\r\nUnited Kingdom, and might therefore be freely taxed for revenue\r\npurposes. It is, indeed, true that a passable herb may be grown and\r\ncalled tobacco, in many parts of the United Kingdom, but the fact has\r\nbeen generally recognized that competition with more tropical countries\r\nis practically fruitless, and therefore to be abandoned. It is easily to\r\nbe understood that so aromatic a crop, monopolizing so many of the best\r\nand rarest qualities of the soil, would require high manuring; and that,\r\njust as is the case of any other crop—such as hops, or even wheat—one\r\ncould get nothing of the special excellence of the herb required but\r\nwhat one has previously put into the soil. But, to be profitable, the\r\nplant requires good heat as well as good soil. This, therefore, is the\r\nwhole economical question, and upon that the matter mainly hinges. The\r\nclaim to grow real tobacco in England or Ireland is based upon the\r\nallegation that the herb can be grown at a profit. The best evidence\r\nfurnished to the House of Commons on Monday evening on this point was\r\nthat of Lord Harris, who affirmed boldly that Ireland and parts of\r\nEngland were prepared to enter into a fair competition with the\r\nrecognized productive colonies. The Government, and with them, Lord\r\nIddesleigh, are in favour of an experiment largely granting all that is\r\nasked, and carefully observing the result. Then, when the British\r\ntobacco comes upon the ordinary market, let it be taxed as any other\r\nsimilar product would be. The Government could not view with anything\r\nbut dismay the prospect of a fall in revenue; and there is no question,\r\ntherefore, that the home-grown tobacco must pay duty to the full. The\r\n_crux_ of the question is how such duty can be enforced without an army\r\nof revenue officers, whose practical duties would bear no reasonable\r\nproportion to their probable cost. Our own impression is that tobacco\r\ncan never be grown in these islands on any large scale to compete with\r\nthe growers within the tropics, and that the expense of collecting\r\nrevenue would be out of all proportion to the amount collected. At the\r\nsame time, it ill becomes us as a Free-trading nation to shut out any\r\nclass of our own countrymen, by duties distinctly prohibitive, from\r\nfollowing a branch of agriculture which they think they could make\r\nprofitable. It is against our principle to offer a bounty on the forced\r\ncultivation of exotics, such as tobacco undoubtedly is when grown in\r\nthese islands, but it would be still worse to maintain, on merely\r\npedantic grounds, a prohibitive import on a crop which many men think\r\nthe smaller tenants could produce to the great advantage of their\r\nholdings. We are by no means sanguine of their success; but that is no\r\nreason why they should not try.”\r\n\r\n_Greece._—The production of tobacco in Greece is about 4 million _okes_\r\n(of 2¾ lb.) annually. Patras, in 1878, exported 300 tons to Holland,\r\nAustria, and Turkey, at a value of 25–30_l._ a ton. The values of the\r\nexports from Syra, in 1879, were 3503_l._ to Great Britain, 2325_l._ to\r\nTurkey, 88_l._ to the Danubian Principalities, 236_l._ to France,\r\n554_l._ to Austria, 436_l._ to Egypt, 1605_l._ to Russia; and in 1878,\r\n1528_l._ to Turkey, 1875_l._ to Great Britain, 93_l._ to the Danubian\r\nPrincipalities, 441_l._ to Austria, 334_l._ to France, 266_l._ to\r\nRussia, 39_l._ to Egypt.\r\n\r\nIn 1884, Nauplia exported 13,000_l._ worth of tobacco; and Calamata,\r\n2400_l._ worth. The value at Patras was 45_s._ per cwt.

In\r\n1876 and 1877, there were 5900 and 3993 packages respectively from Rio\r\nGrande.

In\r\nMadras, Dindigul is the great tobacco district, and cheroots are\r\nmanufactured at Trichinopoli. The islands in the delta of the Godavari\r\nalso yield _lunka_ tobacco, the climate being suitable, and the plants\r\nbeing raised on rather poor, light soil, highly manured and well\r\nwatered. Manilla seeds have been tried on the lower Palnai Hills, but\r\nthe Wynaad has proved to be the best locality. In Bombay, the Kaira and\r\nKhandesh tobaccos are superior; altogether over 40,000 acres were under\r\nthe crop in this presidency in 1871–2, and the exports were 3 million\r\nlb. Shiraz and Manilla seeds yield good plants in Gujrat and Khandesh.\r\nThe total areas under tobacco in 1871–2 were thus returned:—Bengal,\r\nabout 300,000 acres; Punjab, over 90,000; Oudh, 69,500; Rungpore, 60.000\r\n(affording the so-called “Burma cheroots”); Central Provinces, 55,000;\r\nTirhoot, 40,000; Cooch Behar, 24,000; Mysore, 20,000; Dinagepore,\r\n20,000; Purneah, 20,000; Behar, 18,500; Burma, 13,000; Monghyr,\r\n9–10,000; Nuddea, 9–10,000. The best tobacco districts are said to be\r\nSandoway and the island of Cheduba, in Arracan; Rungpore, in Bengal; and\r\nBhilsa, in the Central Provinces. The results of many analyses of South\r\nIndian tobaccos show that their ash seldom contains more than 5–6 per\r\ncent. of carbonate of potash, while American range from 20–40 per cent.,\r\nindicating the poverty of the Indian soils in this important ingredient.\r\nIt might, however, be supplied at moderate cost in the shape of\r\nsaltpetre, which is actually exported largely from the tobacco-growing\r\ndistricts.\r\n\r\nThe bulk of the Indian tobacco exported consists of leaf, the kinds\r\nchiefly shipped being the “Bispah” and “Poolah” varieties of the\r\nRungpore kind; the quantities of cigars and other manufactured tobacco\r\nexported are very small. The exports in lb. for the four years 1875–79\r\nwere:—\r\n\r\n  ───────────────┬────────────┬────────────┬────────────┬────────────\r\n                 │  1875–76.  │  1876–77.  │  1877–78.  │  1878–79.\r\n  ───────────────┼────────────┼────────────┼────────────┼────────────\r\n  Unmanufactured │  22,861,711│  10,508,720│  10,594,604│  13,279,158\r\n  Manufactured:  │            │            │            │\r\n    Cigars       │     152,189│     190,136│     189,742│     196,759\r\n    Other sorts  │     232,720│     205,033│     317,887│     247,743\r\n                 │————————————│————————————│————————————│————————————\r\n  Total          │  23,246,620│  10,903,889│  11,102,233│  13,723,660\r\n  ───────────────┴────────────┴────────────┴────────────┴────────────\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, a considerable quantity of manufactured tobacco,\r\naveraging over 1½ million lb. yearly, is imported, showing that India is\r\nstill merely a producer of raw material, and is dependent upon other\r\ncountries for the manufactured article in a condition fit for\r\nconsumption. Even as regards the raw material, India might do a great\r\ndeal more than at present, for there would be a large and constant\r\ndemand on the continent of Europe for Indian leaf, if it could be\r\nobtained of somewhat better quality. The French and Italian tobacco\r\ndepartments are prepared to take Indian tobacco in large quantities, if\r\nit can be supplied of a quality suited to their purposes; and there\r\nwould also be an extensive demand from Austria and Germany. Although the\r\nshipments consist mainly of leaf tobacco, and that not of good quality,\r\ntobacco manufacture is now making a promising beginning. In the\r\nenterprise being carried on at Ghazipore, in the North-West Provinces,\r\nand at Poosah, in Bengal, both the cultivation and manufacture are under\r\nthe supervision of skilled American growers and curers. Some of this\r\ntobacco sent to the _Administration des Tabacs_ in Paris has been very\r\nfavourably reported on. The factory at Ghazipore is now turning out\r\nabout 500 lb. a day of all classes, the greater part being black\r\ncavendish and honeydew, for the army. The machinery is capable of\r\nturning out 3500 lb. a day, as soon as sufficient hands have been\r\ntrained.\r\n\r\nHitherto no Indian tobacco has realized any valuation approaching that\r\nof American. The average price of the American “shipping tobacco” is\r\n5–6_d._ a lb., higher classes of bright leaf from Virginia realize as\r\nmuch as 7–13_d._ a lb., while the price of Indian tobacco has generally\r\nbeen 1–2_d._ a lb. But the 15,000 lb. of Poosah leaf from the 1877 crop\r\nreached England when American shipping leaf was at 4–5_d._ a lb., or 25\r\nper cent. below the normal rate. The consignment was, moreover, packed\r\nin rather damp order, and contained a quantity of moisture which caused\r\nit to be assessed under the highest rate of the new tariff, which\r\nimposes 3_s._ 10_d._ duty when the moisture is over 10 per cent.,\r\nagainst 3_s._ 6_d._ under 10 per cent. This made a difference in the\r\nvalue, estimated at 1_d._ a lb. The price obtained was 3¾_d._, which\r\nwould have been 4¾_d._ had the tobacco been drier, and the sale has been\r\nfollowed by orders of large shipments.\r\n\r\nThe high prices, too, realized for the best samples of the 1876 and 1877\r\ncrops, indicate that Indian leaf can be turned out equal to the best\r\nshipping tobacco from America. A tierce of strips from the 1876–77 crop\r\nfrom Ghazipore sold for 7_d._ a lb., and the greater part of the rest\r\nfor 5_d._ or more, while a portion of the Poosah leaf of 1877–78 was\r\nvalued at 5_d._ when the market was 25 per cent. below normal rates.\r\nThese facts seem to guarantee future success, since the quantity of the\r\nhigher classes can be largely increased, and a greater portion of the\r\ncrop be brought to the same higher level. The chief point to be\r\nascertained was whether a sufficiently high level could be attained at\r\nall. It has been attained. The cured leaf of 1878 is very much superior\r\nto any hitherto turned out, especially that from Ghazipore. A new market\r\nis not unlikely to open in France. The French Government have already\r\nasked for a consignment for trial of 1000–1500 lb.\r\n\r\nThe reason why the manufacture of smoking-tobacco for Indian consumption\r\nhas occupied so large a share in the operations is, that the Indian\r\nmarket, though small, pays far more handsome profits than the English\r\nmarket.\r\n\r\nThe price paid for reasonably good American manufactured tobacco in\r\nIndia ranges from one to three _rupees_ a lb. Ghazipore and Poosah\r\ntobacco is sold at half that price, at a much higher profit than can be\r\nobtained by sending cured leaf to England.\r\n\r\nWhile Indian cured leaf can find a sale in the English market at prices\r\nwhich will enable it to compete there with American cured leaf, Indian\r\nmanufactured leaf is proved to compete successfully with American\r\nmanufactured leaf in India itself, with a fair prospect of success in a\r\nsimilar competition in the colonies. It may be stated in general terms\r\nthat 4_d._ a lb. for cured leaf in England, and 6–10 _annas_ for\r\nmanufactured leaf in India, will secure sufficient or even handsome\r\nprofits. The opening for profits will perhaps be better understood if it\r\nis explained that 1_d._ a lb. represents an asset of about 5_l._ an\r\nacre. The one great advantage which India has over America is cheap\r\nlabour. It is now proved that the leaf is, for all practical purposes,\r\nas good as the American leaf, and there is hardly any doubt that America\r\ncannot afford to send home leaf at the price at which India can sell.\r\n\r\nThe exports of tobacco from British India during the years 1874–5 to\r\n1878–9 have been as follows:—\r\n\r\n ──────────────────┬──────────┬──────────┬──────────┬──────────┬──────────\r\n                   │  1875.   │  1876.   │  1877.   │  1878.   │  1879.\r\n ──────────────────┼──────────┼──────────┼──────────┼──────────┼──────────\r\n Unmanufac-   } lb.│33,411,504│22,861,711│10,508,720│10,594,604│13,279,158\r\n tured             │          │          │          │          │\r\n Manufactured { lb.│   425,040│   384,909│   395,169│   507,629│   444,502\r\n                No.│ 2,999,940│        ..│        ..│        ..│        ..\r\n ──────────────────┴──────────┴──────────┴──────────┴──────────┴──────────\r\n\r\nThe following letter from the manager of the Poosah tobacco farms,\r\nTirhoot, describes the system of growing and curing now adopted in\r\nIndia.\r\n\r\n“Preparation of Soil.—Tobacco land should be well-drained upland which\r\nhas lain fallow some time or that has had some light crop in it; this\r\nland should be well manured with well-rotted manure. We plough our lands\r\ntwice monthly. Just before the time for transplanting the soil is\r\nploughed up and well pulverized by a henger or beam of wood drawn by\r\nbullocks over the upturned soil so as to bend it and to break up any\r\nlumps of earth. The soil should be sufficiently dry for this purpose so\r\nas not to cake and harden.\r\n\r\n“Seed-beds.—These should be made up in a suitable situation, that is,\r\nprotected from the afternoon sun, having some building or grove of trees\r\non the west side. The seed-beds should be raised some six inches off the\r\nground and have trenches dug all round so as to carry off any\r\nsuperfluous moisture, the beds should be well worked with a kodalie and\r\ngood, rotted manure well worked in. After pulverizing the soil and\r\nlevelling it, pick off any stones or other rubbish and it will be ready\r\nfor sowing the seed. The size of the bed should be about 4 feet by 15\r\nfeet; this is more convenient than square beds, as it enables the plants\r\nto be attended to without risk of destroying them by trampling on them.\r\n\r\n“Sowing the Seed.—The seed is sown broadcast with the hand, mixed with\r\nsome sand or ashes so as to sow evenly; care should be taken not to sow\r\ntoo thickly. About one chittak of seed ought to be found sufficient for\r\none of these beds which would furnish enough plants for one beegah of\r\nland. After having sown and if there is a hot sun, it would be advisable\r\nto cover the beds with light mats. This seed should germinate in seven\r\nor ten days at least. American seed does; Sumatra takes much longer. The\r\nplants may require watering, which should be done with a watering-can\r\nwith a rose, when the plants are well up and large. Only water seed-beds\r\nin the evening. As soon as the seedlings have leaves of the size of a\r\npenny, they are capable of bearing transplanting. Before taking up the\r\nseedling to transplant, water the beds well an hour beforehand; this is\r\ndone to loosen the earth about the roots so that the plants may be taken\r\nup without injury. To take up the seedlings they should be seized by the\r\nunder side of the two largest leaves by the finger and thumb, having one\r\nleaf on each side, not by the stem, then pull up gently, taking care not\r\nto break the leaves. They may then be placed in an open basket. When the\r\nbasket is full it should be covered with a cloth if the sun is hot, and\r\nthe seedlings slightly sprinkled with water and then carried off to\r\ntransplant. The seedlings are planted out in rows 3 feet by 2 feet\r\napart, for which purpose a knotted cord is used, the knots being 3 feet\r\napart. This cord is drawn by two men—one at each end. Across the field\r\nor portion of the field at a distance of 2 feet from the outer edge, the\r\ncord is drawn out and then trampled upon by coolies. The knots leave an\r\nimpression in the soil where the seedlings have to be planted. The cord\r\nis then raised and put down again at another distance of 2 feet from the\r\nfirst, and so on till sufficient land has been marked off. This work can\r\nbe done during the day, and the transplanting in the evening.\r\n\r\n“Transplanting.—Transplanting should be done in the evening if there is\r\nany sun; in cloudy weather it can be done all the day long. Rainy\r\nweather is most suitable as it dispenses with watering and the plants\r\nsettle better. A boy takes a basket of seedlings and walks up the row,\r\ndropping a plant here and there where the marks have been made; he is\r\nfollowed by a man who makes a hole with a _kurpie_, into which he places\r\na seedling, and then presses the soil around the roots firmly with his\r\nfingers, and then goes on with the rest. As transplanting can hardly be\r\ndone here without watering, a boy carrying a can without a rose follows\r\nthe man who is transplanting, and waters each plant he comes across;\r\nbut, as I mentioned above, if the transplanting could be done in rainy\r\nweather, the watering would be unnecessary. When growing the young\r\nplants require some attention. After the plants have been planted a week\r\nor so, weather permitting, it is advisable to loosen and open the soil\r\naround them with a kurpie, and also to eradicate weeds which may appear.\r\nLater on a kodalie may be used to work the earth between the rows. As\r\nsoon as the plants have made growth and begin to throw out flower or\r\nseed-heads, which will take place in about eight weeks or so, they\r\nshould be topped, viz. the flower heads should be broken off before they\r\nflower in this way. The stem on which the head was found should be\r\nseized about two to three feet from the ground and snapped clean off by\r\nthe hand or fingers. This topping will cause the plant to throw out\r\nheavy leaves. The higher up the stem is broken off, so will the leaves\r\nof the plant become thinner and smaller. We generally leave about ten to\r\ntwelve leaves to each plant. After topping, numerous suckers and\r\noffshoots will spring up; these should be promptly broken off as soon as\r\nthey appear, as they take a lot of nourishment from the plant. The plant\r\nripens in about three months. We cut here in January, and none but ripe\r\nplants should be cut.\r\n\r\n“How to Cut Ripe Plants.—A tobacco plant is known to be ripe if the leaf\r\ncracks when taken between finger and thumb and pressed, and also when\r\nthe leaves present a swollen appearance and have a heavy look. The stem\r\nwhen cut is full of sap, very thin rind on edge, the leaves are carved\r\nover and look mottled, the ribs of the plant get brittle, and are easily\r\nbroken off; when fully ripe, the plant is cut at one stroke close to the\r\nground. The best instrument to cut the plant with is a kurpie. When cut,\r\nthe plant is allowed to hang over on its side and wilt or droop in the\r\nsun. This wilting takes from one to two hours according to the strength\r\nof the sun. When sufficiently wilted (which is known when the plants\r\nlook drooping and the ribs can be bent slightly without breaking) the\r\nplants are placed in a cart and taken to the curing-house. Plants should\r\nnot be cut in rainy or cloudy weather, as it is obvious the sun would\r\nnot be hot enough to wilt were the weather cloudy, and the rain washes\r\noff the gum and thereby decreases the weight of the plant. Plants should\r\nnot be cut after the rain unless the gum has returned to the leaves,\r\nwhich is known by their sticky, gummy feeling.”\r\n\r\nThe results of many analyses of the tobacco of South India show that the\r\nashes of these tobaccos seldom contain more than 5 or 6 per cent. of\r\npotash carbonate, while the ashes of American tobacco contain from 20 to\r\n40 per cent., proving the poverty of Indian tobacco soils in this\r\nimportant plant-food—a plant-food, however, easily obtainable in the\r\nshape of saltpetre, and at a moderate cost. But, though saltpetre is\r\nlargely exported from the tobacco-growing districts, it is never\r\nemployed as a manure for tobacco.\r\n\r\n_Italy._—Tobacco is cultivated in Italy in the provinces of Ancona,\r\nBenevento, Terra di Lavoro, Principato Citeriore, Terra d’Otranto,\r\nUmbria, Vicenza, and Sardinia. The area and produce in the following\r\nyears were:—in 1870, 9544 acres, 67,192 cwt.; 1872, 12,256 acres, 82,349\r\ncwt.; 1874, 8202 acres, 90,300 cwt. The exports from Naples in 1879 were\r\n2006 _kilo._, value 401_l._\r\n\r\nThe British Consul at Cagliari reports that the cultivation of tobacco\r\nis only carried on in the district of Sassari, and in the plains of\r\nSassari, Portotorres, Nurra, Sorso, and Sennori. No positive data on\r\nthis branch of industry can be had, it having been exclusively carried\r\non till 1883 by a private company, called the Regía Cointeressata.\r\nWithout fear of being wrong, it may be calculated that the tobacco\r\ncultivators reach the number of 100, who employ during the period of\r\nfive months from 600 to 700 labourers; the plantation varies from\r\n4,000,000 to 5,000,000 plants, producing a harvest from 2000 to 2500\r\n_quintals_ of tobacco leaves, at a value of about 125,000 _lire_.\r\n\r\n_Japan._—Japanese tobacco is well known in the London market, but it is\r\noften in a soft condition, and then scarcely saleable. More care is\r\nneeded in drying it before packing.\r\n\r\n_Java._—Tobacco, termed by the natives _tombáku_, or _sáta_, is an\r\narticle of very general cultivation in Java, but is only extensively\r\nraised for exportation in the central districts of Kedu and Banyumas. As\r\nit requires a soil of the richest mould, but at the same time not\r\nsubject to inundations, these districts hold out peculiar advantages to\r\nthe tobacco-planter, not to be found on the low lands. For internal\r\nconsumption, small quantities are raised in convenient spots everywhere.\r\nIn Kedu, tobacco forms, after rice, by far the most important article of\r\ncultivation, and, in consequence of the fitness of the soil, the plant\r\ngrows to the height of 8–10 feet, on lands not previously dressed or\r\nmanured, with a luxuriance seldom witnessed in India. Cultivated here\r\nalternately with rice, only one crop of either is obtained within the\r\nyear; but after the harvest of the rice, or the gathering of the tobacco\r\nleaves, the land is allowed to remain fallow, till the season again\r\narrives for preparing it to receive the other. The young plant is not\r\nraised within the district, but procured from the high lands in the\r\nvicinity, principally from the district of Kalibéber, on the slope of\r\nthe mountain Diéng or Práhu, where it is raised and sold by the hundred\r\nto the cultivators of the adjoining districts. The transplantation takes\r\nplace in June, and the plant is at its full growth in October. The\r\nexports in the year 1877–8 were 212,500 _piculs_ to Holland, and 213 to\r\nSingapore; in 1878–9, they were 248,566 _piculs_ to Holland, and 872 to\r\nSingapore. The value of the export to Holland in 1879 was stated at\r\n1,250,000_l._ The exports in 1884 were 140,351 _piculs_ to Holland, and\r\n2490 to Great Britain.\r\n\r\n_New Zealand._—This colony has not yet figured as a tobacco grower, but\r\nthe duty on locally produced tobacco is only 1_s._ a lb., and this is\r\nexpected to stimulate the home industry.\r\n\r\n_Nicaragua._—It appears that the total exports of tobacco were 13,787\r\nlb., value 4830 dollars, in 1883, but only 300 lb., value 240 dollars,\r\nin 1884. At present it is a Government monopoly.\r\n\r\n_Paraguay._—Consul Baker, of Buenos Ayres, states that one of the most\r\nvaluable crops of Paraguay is tobacco; in 1829, its production amounted\r\nto only 2,675,000 lb., while in 1860, the crop amounted to 15,000,000\r\nlb.; but the war with the allies almost ruined this source of wealth. It\r\nhas, however, somewhat recovered its importance, the exports alone last\r\nyear amounting to 8,975,000 lb. A large proportion of the crop is\r\nannually worked up into cigars, a branch of industry which is almost\r\nentirely in the hands of the women. The tobacco planted in Paraguay\r\noriginally came from Havana, with the exception of a particular kind\r\nwhich is called in Paraguay, blue tobacco, _peti-hoby_, the origin of\r\nwhich is unknown. The favourite leaf is a yellow tobacco, _peti-para_,\r\ngrown chiefly in Villa Rica, which possesses about 6 per cent. of\r\nnicotine.\r\n\r\n_Persia._—The whole of the eastern coast of the Black Sea, i. e.\r\nMingrelia, Lazistan, Abkhasia, and Circassia, is admirably suited for\r\ntobacco cultivation. The country between Poti and Súkhúm Kalé contains\r\nadmirable sites for tobacco plantations, labour for which can be got\r\nfrom Trebizond. A great demand for tobacco of good quality exists in the\r\ncountry, and a practical planter should do well. A quantity of coarse,\r\nbadly-cured tobacco, of no commercial value, is produced in Imeritia and\r\nGeorgia. Great success has attended the culture in Ghilan. The first\r\nseed introduced was from Samsoun; since then Yenija seed has been tried,\r\nand some parcels attained the standard of the best Turkish tobacco. It\r\ncan be produced at about 20_s._ a _pood_ (of 36 lb.), giving a profit of\r\n22_s._ a cwt. Hitherto the cultivation has been confined to the plains,\r\nwhere both soil and atmosphere are damp, but it might be worth trying\r\nthe hill-skirts. About 2000 cwt. were produced in 1878. The exports of\r\ntobacco, the produce of Ghilan, from Resht to Russia, were valued at\r\n4615_l._ in 1878, and 6154_l._ in 1879. The values (in rupees) of the\r\nexports in 1879 were 13,000 from Bushire, 73,500 from Lingah, and 35,000\r\nfrom Bahrein.\r\n\r\nAt the time when I wrote the article on tobacco in Spons’ Encyclopædia,\r\nthe true source and history of an article called “tumbeki” was still in\r\ndoubt. From researches made at the instigation of my friend E. Morell\r\nHolmes, F.L.S., the Curator of the Pharmaceutical Society’s Museum, it\r\nis now clear that it is a Persian tobacco, and as such calls for mention\r\nhere. The following paragraph reproduces what I said on the subject in\r\nSpons’ Encyclopædia.\r\n\r\n“Tumbeki.—This word, under a multitude of forms, is the common name in\r\nseveral Eastern languages (Bengali, Hindustani, Telugu, Sunda, Javanese,\r\nMalayan, Persian, Guzerati, Deccan) for ordinary tobacco. But in Asia\r\nMinor, it is applied to a narcotic leaf which is spoken of as distinct\r\nfrom tobacco, and is separately classified in the Consular Returns.\r\nBotanical authorities are at variance as to the plant which affords it,\r\nsome attributing it to a _Lobelia_, while others consider it a kind of\r\ntobacco. The latter appears to be the more correct supposition. The\r\nflower resembles the tobacco in being trumpet-shaped; the leaf is\r\nbroader, larger, and rounder than that of the tobacco raised in Turkey,\r\nand is also wrinkled like the inner leaf of the cabbage. The plant is\r\nraised from seed in nurseries, and when it has 4 or 5 leaves, is planted\r\nout in April in the prepared field, and watered sparingly. It is ‘set’\r\nin a day or two, and is then hoed occasionally to free it from weeds.\r\nAfter inflorescence, and when the plant is sufficiently ‘cooked,’ it is\r\ncut down, or pulled up bodily, and re-set in the ground till the leaves\r\nare wilted. These leaves are dried, and, after exposure to the dew, are\r\npressed heavily, when they undergo a kind of fermentation which develops\r\nthe aroma. It is exceedingly narcotic: so much so, that it is usually\r\nsteeped in water before use, and placed in the pipe (a _narghilé_ or\r\nwater-pipe) while still wet. The exports of this article (the produce of\r\nPersia) from the port of Trebizonde are considerable:—In 1877, they were\r\n13,342 bales (of 1¾ cwt.), value 106,736_l._, to Turkey; in 1878, 11,571\r\nbales, 92,568_l._, to Turkey; in 1879, 9659 bales, 77,272_l._, to\r\nTurkey, and 866 bales, 6928_l._, to Greece. Aleppo, in 1878, sent 4\r\ntons, value 320_l._, to Turkey, and 11 tons, 880_l._, to Egypt. The\r\nexports of the article, the produce of the interior of Persia, from\r\nResht to Russia, were valued at 5000_l._ in 1877, and 3846_l._ in 1878.”\r\n\r\nIt will be interesting to compare this with Holmes’ paper read before\r\nthe Pharmaceutical Society on February 10, 1886:—\r\n\r\n“Tumbeki is the name under which an article of regular commerce between\r\nPersia and Turkey is mentioned in the consular reports, especially in\r\nthat for Trebizonde.\r\n\r\n“Two or three years ago an inquiry was made at this institution\r\nconcerning the nature and botanical source of umbeki, and the only\r\ninformation I was then able to give was that in the ‘Treasury of Botany’\r\ntumbeky is stated to be the narcotic leaf of a species of lobelia.\r\n\r\n“From its frequent occurrence in the Blue Books in the same list with\r\ntobacco, and from the large quantities mentioned as an export from\r\nTrebizonde, my correspondent suggested that it was probably something\r\nused for smoking like tobacco. In the hope that tumbeki might prove to\r\nbe some drug possessing important narcotic or possible medicinal\r\nproperties, I wrote to Mr. A. Biliotti, Consul at Trebizonde, for\r\ninformation. In reply, he forwarded samples of tumbeki of different\r\ngrowths and qualities. This proved on examination to be unquestionably\r\nsome kind of tobacco, and being puzzled to know why it figured in the\r\nBlue Books as a distinct article, I asked Mr. Thomas Christy, F.L.S., to\r\nmake inquiries for me in Persia. He received the following note through\r\nMr. Zanni, the well-known chemist at Constantinople, from whom I\r\nreceived the following information:—\r\n\r\n“‘There are three qualities of the teymbeki, all derived from the\r\n_Nicotiana persica_.\r\n\r\n“‘1. Shiraz teymbeki, valued at twenty gold piastres per oke.[A]\r\n\r\n“‘2. Kechan teymbeki, valued at ten gold piastres.\r\n\r\n“‘3. Teheran teymbeki, equal in value to No. 2.\r\n\r\n“‘The Shiraz is the best quality, the leaves are four decimetres long\r\nand half a decimetre wide. The leaves of the two other qualities are not\r\nso large. The quantity of alkaloid in the leaves of teymbeki is more\r\nthan in the leaves of _Nicotiana Tabacum_; it is much used in\r\nConstantinople, but more so in Egypt, Syria, and particularly in Persia.\r\nTeymbeki is smoked in a special apparatus known as the narghileh.[B] The\r\napparatus is found in every coffee-house and even in a great number of\r\nprivate houses. It resembles somewhat the wash bottle used in\r\nlaboratories for washing filters with distilled water, but is often made\r\nof metal. The teymbeki is placed in a small reservoir on the top of the\r\nflask and burns in contact with a piece of incandescent charcoal. The\r\nvapour is drawn through the tube, which passes to the bottom of the\r\nwater and collects above it, whence it is inhaled through the longer\r\ntube.[C] It is in fact a water-pipe.’\r\n\r\n“Having ascertained then that tumbeki was a species of tobacco, I sought\r\nfor further confirmation of the statement that it is the produce of _N.\r\npersica_, and wrote on the subject to Professor Hausknecht, who is well\r\nknown as one of the best authorities on the botany of Persia. He kindly\r\nreplied as follows:—\r\n\r\n“‘Tumbeki is the produce of _Nicotiana rustica_, and is almost\r\nexclusively used for the water-pipes called kalian or narghileh. The\r\nplant is cultivated throughout the whole of Persia, especially in\r\nIspahan and Shiraz, whence the best kind comes.’\r\n\r\n“But the statement of M. Zanni that tumbeki contains more alkaloid than\r\ntobacco, and that of Professor Hausknecht that tumbeki is the produce of\r\n_N. rustica_, seemed to conflict with the statements in books that _N.\r\nrustica_ is less active than _N. Tabacum_.\r\n\r\n“In the ‘Commercial Report,’ No. 25, 1883, p. 1056, under ‘Smyrna,’\r\nConsul Dennis confirms M. Zanni’s statement concerning tumbeki. He\r\nsays:—‘It is much stronger than ordinary tobacco, and cannot be smoked\r\nin the usual way, therefore it is exclusively used for the narghili.’ He\r\nalso adds that a large quantity is consumed in the district of Smyrna,\r\nbut much is also re-exported to Egypt and other parts of Turkey. It is\r\nimported from Persia, both through Trebizonde and Bushire on the Persian\r\nGulf.\r\n\r\n“Mr. J. B. Fraser, in his work on Persia (1826), remarks, ‘The tobacco\r\nsmoked in the kalian is called tumbaku in distinction to tootoon, or\r\nthat smoked in pipes or cigarettes. It is sold in the leaf, which is\r\npacked dry in layers, and is preserved in bags sewn up in raw hide. It\r\nimproves by age, but is quite unsmokable the first year. The best comes\r\nfrom Jaroum, south of Shiraz.’\r\n\r\n“In an interesting article in ‘Harper’s Magazine’ (January 1886, p. 224)\r\non the ‘Domestic and Court Customs of Persia,’ the writer remarks\r\nconcerning tumbeki:—‘The kaliân or water pipe differs from the Turkish\r\nnarghileh by having a short straight stem. In it is smoked the tobacco\r\ncalled tumbakee—a species grown only in Persia. That of Shiraz is very\r\ndelicate in flavour and is the best. The tumbakee must be first soaked\r\nin water and squeezed like a sponge or it will cause vertigo. A live\r\ncoal, made from the root of the vine, is placed on the tobacco, and the\r\nsmoke is drawn through the water with a gentle inhaling, depositing the\r\noil in its passage through the water.’\r\n\r\n“In De Candolle’s ‘Prodromus,’ vol. xii., pt. 1, p. 567, it is stated\r\nunder _Nicotiana persica_, that it yields the celebrated tobacco of\r\nShiraz. This species closely resembles _N. Tabacum_ in the form of its\r\nleaves, which are, however, rather acute than acuminate; but the flowers\r\nare different both in shape and colour. In _N. Tabacum_ the stem leaves\r\nare sessile, and the corolla is funnel-shaped or inflated below the\r\nlimb, and is of a pinkish-red colour; in _N. persica_, the tube of the\r\ncorolla is club-shaped and the limb more spreading; the colour is white\r\ninside and greenish outside. When in blossom, therefore, the two plants\r\nare easily distinguished. _N. rustica_, on the other hand, has _stalked_\r\ncordate leaves and a short yellowish corolla, with the tube and limb\r\nboth short.\r\n\r\n“The leaves of tumbeki which I have received from Trebizonde and\r\nConstantinople both correspond with _N. persica_ in character, but not\r\nwith _N. rustica_, since they have no trace of a petiole. So far as it\r\nis possible to ascertain therefore, in the absence of flowers, the\r\nweight of evidence is in favour of tumbeki being the produce of _N.\r\npersica_. In order to ascertain the correctness of the statement that\r\ntumbeki is stronger than tobacco, I handed some specimen to Messrs. E.\r\nJ. Eastes and W. H. Ince for chemical examination, which they kindly\r\nundertook at my request.”\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote A:\r\n\r\n  The oke equals ten kilogrames; a piastre, 2½_d._\r\n\r\nFootnote B:\r\n\r\n  So called from its resemblance in shape to a _narghil_ or coconut.\r\n\r\nFootnote C:\r\n\r\n  A full and interesting account of the forms and uses of the varieties\r\n  of the kalian and narghileh is given in the ‘Land of the Lion and the\r\n  Sun,’ p. 29.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFollowing is the report of these gentlemen on the chemistry of the\r\nsubject:—\r\n\r\n“Four samples of tumbeki were brought under our notice by Mr. Holmes,\r\nCurator of the Museum of the Pharmaceutical Society, being of interest\r\non account of their reported greater strength in nicotine as compared\r\nwith tobacco. The following are the results of our investigations. We\r\nmay state that so far as we have been able to ascertain no previous\r\nresearches have been undertaken on the subject.\r\n\r\n“Preliminary Examination.—The presence of an alkaloid was demonstrated\r\non the addition of the usual reagents to the acid infusion.\r\n\r\n“Isolation of Alkaloid for Physical Examination.—The powdered tumbeki\r\nwas placed in a retort with milk of lime and steam passed through it\r\ntill the distillate was no longer alkaline. Alkaloid in abundance was\r\nfound in the distillate, which had a distinct odour of nicotine. The\r\ndistillate was then extracted with ether, and the ether slowly driven\r\noff. The residue obtained was a light straw coloured oily liquid of\r\npowerful odour, giving off irritating fumes when heated.\r\n\r\n“Estimation of Nicotine.—In the estimation of nicotine much difficulty\r\nwas experienced, owing to imperfect knowledge of the alkaloid, and to\r\nthe imperfect methods recommended in various papers on the subject. The\r\nonly method we found reliable was by using a standard solution of\r\nMayer’s reagent, obtained by mixing 13·546 grams of mercuric chloride in\r\nsolution with 49·8 grams of potassic iodide, in solution, and adding\r\nwater to make 1 litre.[D] One c.c. of this solution represents ·003945\r\ngrams of nicotine, the precipitate having the formula C₁₀H₁₆N₂I₂.HgI₂.\r\n\r\n“The method we adopted of working with this solution was as follows:—One\r\nor more grams of dried and powdered tumbeki were treated with diluted\r\nsulphuric acid (2·5 per cent.) for several hours on a water-bath,\r\nfiltered, and the leaves washed with hot 1 per cent. acid till the\r\nfiltrate was colourless.\r\n\r\n“The filtrate was then either evaporated to a low bulk and extracted\r\nwith alcohol, to get rid of albuminous matters which interfered with the\r\nreaction, or neutralized with sodic hydrate and the alkaloid extracted\r\nwith chloroform, the chloroformic solution being shaken with diluted\r\nsulphuric acid as in the ordinary methods of alkaloid extraction.\r\n\r\n“The objection to the first method is that the alcohol has to be driven\r\noff before the Mayer’s reagent can be added, which is troublesome and\r\nlengthens the process.\r\n\r\n“The solution of the alkaloid in excess of sulphuric acid having been\r\nobtained, Mayer’s reagent was carefully added till no more precipitation\r\nwas observed, the end of the reaction being ascertained when on\r\nfiltering some of the nicotine solution into a watch-glass and adding a\r\ndrop of the reagent, no precipitate was formed. With careful\r\nmanipulation concordant results were obtained.\r\n\r\n“Other methods tried were as follows:\r\n\r\n“Volumetric method.—Ten or more grams of powdered tumbeki were distilled\r\nwith a solution of sodic or potassic hydrate, the distillate being\r\npassed into a known volume of decinormal standard solution of sulphuric\r\nacid, and the amount of acid neutralized by the nicotine was determined\r\nby a standard decinormal solution of soda and the nicotine calculated.\r\n\r\n“By this method the results obtained were invariably too high owing to\r\nan appreciable quantity of ammonium salts contained in the leaves. Dr.\r\nKissling[E] has also noticed the high percentages obtained by this\r\nmethod of estimating nicotine.\r\n\r\n“Kosutány treats the leaves with milk of lime till all the ammonia is\r\ndriven off, and then extracts with water; shakes the aqueous solution\r\nwith petroleum ether and proceeds as before.\r\n\r\n“This method was not found to give good results, for though the ammonium\r\nsalts do not interfere with the reaction, yet the petroleum ether does\r\nnot extract the whole of the alkaloid, and thus a low percentage is\r\nobtained.\r\n\r\n“Extraction by Ammoniacal Ether.—This consists in extracting the\r\npowdered leaves in an upright extractor, by an ethereal solution of\r\nammonia, and either driving off the ether and weighing the residue as\r\nnicotine; or volumetrically estimating the residue by decinormal\r\nsolution of sulphuric acid, or precipitating the alkaloid by platinum\r\nperchloride. In either case, whichever way the residue is estimated, the\r\nresults are too high, owing to the difficulty of entirely getting rid of\r\nthe ammonia.\r\n\r\n“The following are the percentages of nicotine in the tumbeki:—\r\n\r\n                  ‘_Ispahan._’—I.

Zeit.,’ ix., 1886.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n“Estimation of Saccharoid Matter; calculated as cane sugar.—The\r\nfermentation process was the one adopted, not that we consider it by any\r\nmeans a good one, but because it was the only one practicable. Fehling’s\r\nsolution was inadmissible, owing to the precipitation of colouring and\r\nother matters, and the polariscope gave no indication. The objections to\r\nthe fermentation process are due to the small amount of alcohol produced\r\nin the relatively large bulk of liquid. This renders the solution liable\r\nto acetification, and the ultimate distillate obtained is very weak in\r\nspirit, making it extremely difficult to obtain the correct specific\r\ngravity; the specific gravities obtained were always between ·998 and\r\nunity.\r\n\r\n“We worked as follows:—200 grains of dried tumbeki were exhausted by\r\nrepeated infusion in boiling water. The filtered liquid when cool was\r\nmixed with 100 grains of German yeast and allowed to stand three days in\r\na warm place to ferment.\r\n\r\n“About one-third was then distilled, the distillate being redistilled\r\nand three successive fractions of 500 fluid grains collected, the\r\nalcohol in each being estimated; the third portion contained little if\r\nany spirit.\r\n\r\n“It being stated that basic acetate of lead removes saccharoid matter\r\nfrom the kindred plant tobacco; we tried its action on the infusion of\r\ntumbeki.\r\n\r\n“At the onset it was found impossible to thoroughly wash the bulky\r\nprecipitate caused by the lead; so, to ensure a definite result,\r\nsufficient basic acetate of lead was added to the infusion of 200 grains\r\nof tumbeki and the whole made up to 30 fluid ounces with distilled water\r\nand well mixed. An aliquot part (20 fluid ounces) was then filtered off,\r\nexcess of lead removed by sulphuretted hydrogen, the sulphide filtered\r\nout, the solution boiled to drive off the sulphuretted hydrogen and the\r\ninfusion, when cool, was fermented in the usual way. But acetic acid was\r\nnecessarily present from the decomposition of the lead salt by the\r\nsulphuretted hydrogen, and this on distilling would tend to raise the\r\nspecific gravity. To remedy this, slaked lime, or preferably potassic\r\nhydrate, was added before redistilling, but considering that from one to\r\nthree per cent. of ammoniacal salt is contained in the original tumbeki,\r\nit is probable that some might still remain and by the action of the\r\nfixed alkali furnish a trace of free ammonia which would lower the\r\nspecific gravity, and thus apparently raise the percentage of alcohol.\r\nAs far as we can judge basic acetate of lead does not seem to remove\r\nfermentable matter from infusion of tumbeki.\r\n\r\n             ────────┬──────────────────┬──────────────────\r\n                     │        I.        │       II.\r\n             ────────┼─────┬────────────┼─────┬────────────\r\n                     │     │     Pb     │     │     Pb\r\n                     │     │ treatment. │     │ treatment.\r\n             Ispahan │2·64 │    2·67    │  —  │    2·35\r\n             Hidjaz  │3·00 │    2·8     │ 2·7 │     —\r\n             Kechan  │5·58 │    5·33    │  —  │     —\r\n             Shiraz  │3·48 │    3·88    │3·23 │    3·1\r\n             ────────┴─────┴────────────┴─────┴────────────\r\n\r\n“Ash.—The following bases and acids were uniformly found in the\r\nashes:—Sodium, potassium, lithium, magnesium, calcium, iron, aluminium,\r\nsilica, chlorine, phosphoric acid, sulphuric acid, carbonic acid.\r\n\r\n                       GENERAL TABLE OF RESULTS.\r\n\r\n   ─────────────────────────┬─────────┬─────────┬─────────┬─────────\r\n                            │Ispahan. │Hidjaz.  │Kechan.  │Shiraz.\r\n   ─────────────────────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────\r\n   Nicotine                 │ 5·4945  │ 2·046   │ 2·909   │ 5·835\r\n   Saccharoid matter        │ 2·64    │ 2·85    │ 5·58    │ 3·355\r\n   Saccharoid matter after  │         │         │         │\r\n   Pb treatment             │ 2·51    │ 2·80    │ 5·33    │ 3·49\r\n   Soluble in water         │42·0     │42·3     │39·9     │55·6\r\n   Insoluble in water       │58·0     │57·7     │60·1     │44·4\r\n   Ash                      │22·0     │28·5     │28·5     │26·15\r\n   ─────────────────────────┴─────────┴─────────┴─────────┴─────────\r\n\r\n“The foregoing work has been carried out in the laboratories of the\r\nPharmaceutical Society.”\r\n\r\n_Philippines._—The soil and climate of the Philippines are eminently\r\nsuited to tobacco culture; but the unjust Spanish monopoly cripples the\r\nindustry, and it is declining. Next to the Cuban (Vuelta abajo) and a\r\nfew prime Turkish sorts, Manilla tobacco is admitted to be the best.\r\nMost of the Philippines produce it. According to the quality of the\r\nproduce, the provinces rank as follows:—(1) Cayagan and Ysabel, (2)\r\nYgorrotes, (3) Island of Mindanáo, (4) Bisayas, (5) New Ecija. On the\r\naverage, over 400 million cigars, and a quantity of tobacco sufficient\r\nto bring up the total weight to 56,000 cwt., are annually exported. The\r\nadvantage of the plantations in Cayagan lies in the annual deposit of\r\nalluvial matters by the overflowing of the large streams. The\r\ncultivation in Bisayas promises to become extinct, whereas if the\r\nnatives were free to sell in the best market, the industry would\r\nincrease immensely. The yield of the Cebu district in 1878 was 8780\r\n_quintals_, the whole of which went to the cigar factories of Cadiz and\r\nAlicante. The exports from Manilla were:—in 1877 17,526,700 lb. tobacco,\r\nvalue 525,801_l._; 87,007,000 cigars, value 243,619_l._; 1878,\r\n15,630,400 lb. tobacco, value 468,918_l._; 136,835,000 cigars, value\r\n383,136_l._; 1879, 9971 _quintals_ (of 101½ lb.) tobacco leaf to Great\r\nBritain, and 74,490 _quintals_ to Spain; cigars, 10,571,000 to Great\r\nBritain, 6,557,000 to Australia, 44,586,000 to the Straits Settlements\r\nand India, 25,861,000 to China and Japan, 693,000 to the United States,\r\n100,000 to California, 1,521,000 to Spain and the Continent; the total\r\nvalues amounted to 480,263_l._ The exports of tobacco from Yloilo were\r\n25,454 _piculs_ (of 133⅓ lb.) in 1878, and 20,600 _quintals_ (of 101½\r\nlb.) in 1879, all to Spain.\r\n\r\n_Roumania._—Tobacco was extensively cultivated at one time, with\r\nsuccess, near Macin and in other parts; but the monopoly has greatly\r\naffected the condition of the industry.\r\n\r\n_Russia._—As regards the production of tobacco, Russia ranks second\r\namong continental countries, but the consumption is less per head than\r\nin other lands. Consul Stanton says that smoking began in the latter\r\npart of the sixteenth century, and the habit steadily increased,\r\nnotwithstanding the fact that it was punished by the knout, slitting of\r\nthe nostrils, and banishment to Siberia. It is most extensively\r\ncultivated in Tshernigoff, Poltava, Bessarabia, and Samara. In Poland,\r\nthe production is not large, and is mainly confined to the vicinity of\r\nWarsaw. It is chiefly cultivated by the peasants and is often their only\r\noccupation.\r\n\r\nIn 1883, Riga exported 70,722 _pouds_ of leaf tobacco, valued at 194,486\r\n_rubles_. Sevastopol shipped 59 _pouds_, value 1100 _rubles_. Tobacco is\r\nnow cultivated largely in all parts of the Crimea, and is likely to\r\nbecome an export of considerable importance. In Taganrof plantations are\r\non the increase, and the culture promises well.\r\n\r\n_San Salvador._—The exports of tobacco in 1884 were 16,113 dollars’\r\nworth of leaf, 5898 dollars’ worth of manufactured, and 826 dollars’\r\nworth of other sorts.\r\n\r\n_Servia._—It is estimated that there are 4000 acres under tobacco\r\nculture in Servia.\r\n\r\n_Spain._—The port of Cadiz is a great centre of the tobacco industry.\r\nThe imports here in 1878 were:—123 _kilo._ from Germany, 304,538 _kilo._\r\nfrom the United States, and 6,776,900 _kilo._ from Spanish colonies; the\r\nexports were 15,600 _kilo._ to Germany, and 213,846 _kilo._ to France.\r\nCorunna exported 58,280 _kilo._, value 87,420 _pesetas_, in 1884. Cadiz\r\nexported 514,817 _kilo._, value 2,574,085 _pesetas_, in the same year.\r\n\r\n_Sumatra._—This great island is assuming a first-rate importance in the\r\ntobacco industry.\r\n\r\nThe year 1883 was an exceptionally favourable one, as the harvest in\r\nSumatra was very good, while prices for Java tobacco were higher than of\r\nlate years, in consequence of the short harvest of 1882.\r\n\r\nLarge quantities of Sumatra tobacco found buyers in the United States,\r\nin consequence of the protectionist measure introduced in that country\r\nin favour of the home tobacco producers. The duty was raised from 35 c.\r\nto 75 c. per lb. on and after the 1st July, 1883, and great efforts were\r\nmade to import as much as possible at the lower duty before that date.\r\n\r\nThe principal owners of the plantations are Dutchmen, and the labour\r\nemployed is Chinese coolies, brought to the island principally from the\r\nMalaya peninsula. The crop, according to one of these successful\r\nplanters, is scarcely ever reared two years in succession on the same\r\nlands. The jungle is first cleared, and then the seed planted. After the\r\nfirst crop of tobacco is gathered, it is the next season used for rice,\r\nor something else, and tobacco is not planted again until the sixth or\r\nseventh year after the jungle is cleared. By adopting this method, a\r\nbetter result is obtained.\r\n\r\nThe drying-house is thus described by a recent visitor to the island:—\r\n\r\n“The interior is very much like a rick-yard, with tobacco stalks instead\r\nof hay-ricks, among which a perfect army of half-clad Chinese coolies,\r\n400 strong, are hard at work sorting, ranging and stowing. So\r\noverpoweringly strong is the scent of the half-dried tobacco leaves that\r\na smoker would have nothing to do but to take in an empty pipe with him\r\nand enjoy a good hard smoke gratis, merely by inhaling the air through\r\nit. But the Chinamen, whether habituated to it by long use, or fortified\r\nagainst it by the superior power of opium, breathe this perfumed\r\natmosphere as easily as if it were the purest air of the sea. ‘That is\r\nhow we measure the heat, you see,’ says our host, calling our attention\r\nto the hollow bamboos thrust through the heart of each stack, with a\r\nstick inside it, which, when pulled out, is almost too hot to touch. ‘It\r\nmust never be above or below a certain point, you know. Instead of\r\nstripping off the leaves at once, we hang up the whole plant to dry, and\r\ndo not strip it till it is quite dried. The Sumatra tobacco, however,\r\nwill not do for cigars. It is only used for what we call the ‘deckblatt’\r\n(cover leaf), which covers the outside of the cigar.’”\r\n\r\nConsul Kennedy reports that “the main cause of the prosperity in Deli is\r\nthe tobacco, the first crop of which was shipped in 1869.\r\n\r\n“The crop for 1884 will turn out about 122,000 bales, valued at\r\n2,080,000_l._\r\n\r\n“The accompanying table shows the export during the last 11 years:—\r\n\r\n                        Year.

As a smoking-tobacco it lacks flavour. There is a pretty\r\ngeneral concurrence of opinion that the seed of the Deli tobacco was\r\nindigenous, and obtained from Batak tribes in the interior; and although\r\nmany experiments have been made with seeds from Java, Manilla, and other\r\nplaces, the planters have invariably come back to the original seed,\r\nfinding that the new kinds develop a coarseness of leaf attributed to\r\nthe extraordinary richness of the virgin soil, a soil partly alluvial\r\nand partly volcanic, but covered throughout with dense forests.\r\n\r\n“The tobacco estates consist of grants of land taken out by individuals\r\nor companies, and are as a rule of such an extent that every year a new\r\ndistrict can be cleared and used for the coming crop, and this state of\r\nthings will continue for many years to come; indeed, hitherto only a\r\nsmall portion of the ground cultivated (not one-fifth) has borne two\r\ncrops, although it is expected that, unless fresh ground is taken up by\r\nthe planters, a time will arrive when use must be made of old fallow\r\nlands, and then guano will be required.\r\n\r\n“The planters consist of three or four large companies, principally\r\nDutch—such as the Deli Company, the Amsterdam Deli, and the Batavia\r\nDeli—as well as of individual planters of many nationalities, Germany\r\nand Switzerland being strongly represented, while there are also a good\r\nsprinkling of Englishmen, the principal English firm being the Langkat\r\nPlantations Company, with its headquarters in London.\r\n\r\n“The grants of land are taken direct from the chiefs before mentioned,\r\nand are only valid after confirmation at Bengkalis. The term is for 75\r\nyears, and for such a grant a sum of money, by way of premium, amounting\r\nto from 1 dol. to 2 dol. per bouw (equal to an acre and two-thirds), is\r\npaid in cash, while an annual rent of 40 c. a bouw, payable at the\r\nexpiration of the fifth year, is also reserved. Such at least are the\r\nterms of the last recognised agreements. The whole of the\r\nconveniently-situated land in the three districts before-mentioned has\r\nnow been taken up, and it is only in the outlying regions that fresh\r\nground can be obtained; but as in such outlying regions settled\r\ngovernment is not so well established, the Dutch authorities are now\r\nvery chary in confirming grants in places where the tobacco-growing\r\ncommunity would be less under control.\r\n\r\n“It is estimated that at least 2,000,000_l._ sterling is now invested in\r\nthe tobacco industry in the Deli districts.\r\n\r\n“The tobacco when ready for shipment is all sent to Clambia on the L\r\nangle at river, to the Deli river, or the Sirdang river (as the case may\r\nbe), and is despatched thence viâ Penang or Singapore to Amsterdam,\r\nwhich is the tobacco mart for the continent of Europe. The United States\r\nhave also bought the Deli tobacco in the Amsterdam market in late years.\r\nVery little of the tobacco goes to England. The leaf remains so moist\r\nthat the English import duty would press it heavily in comparison with\r\nother tobaccos, and this circumstance operates as a check on the import\r\nof tobacco from Sumatra into England as compared with tobacco from Java.\r\nThe principal purchasers are German manufacturers and Dutch middlemen.\r\nThe latter retail the tobacco over the continent, and supply the several\r\nRégies, amongst others the Austrian, Italian, and French. The Americans\r\nconfine their purchases to dark-leaved, heavy tobacco, requiring 100\r\nleaves or less to the lb.\r\n\r\n“It is worth remarking that the whole of the carrying trade in\r\nconnection with the Deli tobaccos is in the hands of Messrs. Holt’s\r\nline, the rate of freight from Deli to Amsterdam being about 3_l._ 2_s._\r\n6_d._ per ton. The shipping season may be said to last from January to\r\nJune.\r\n\r\n“The tobacco crop of 1884 is estimated to yield about 20,000 bales in\r\nexcess of that of 1883, but the crop in 1883 was a short one owing to\r\nunfavourable weather. The 1884 crop is the best one ever obtained, both\r\nas regards quantity and quality. Roughly speaking, the Deli tobacco in\r\nthe Amsterdam market fetches 1_s._ 4_d._ per lb. English, and the\r\nprofits realized may be judged from the dividends given by the most\r\nflourishing companies; the shares of the Deli Company being now quoted\r\nat 500 per cent. premium. Of course there are exceptions where\r\nunsuitable soils have been met with, and losses have been sustained of\r\nno inconsiderable amount. These losses have occurred principally on\r\nSirdang lands, where the tobacco grown is reputed not equal to that\r\nproduced in the other two districts. This comparative defect is\r\ndisclosed in the burning, the Sirdang tobacco yielding a brown instead\r\nof a white ash, and being probably therefore lacking in potash.\r\n\r\n“The forests when cleared for the tobacco plantations afford splendid\r\ntimber, and this is utilized for constructing drying-sheds and coolies’\r\nquarters, but a good deal of the wood which might be exported for\r\nbuilding or fuel is wasted for want of conveyance and burnt on the\r\nground. As a compensation there can be no doubt that this burnt timber,\r\nor rather the ashes of it, supply an excellent manure.\r\n\r\n“The labour employed may be distributed under three classes. There are,\r\nfirstly, Malays and Batak tribesmen, who fell heavy timber, do general\r\nclearance, and build sheds; then come the Klings from the Madras\r\ndistricts, who occupy themselves with drainage and road-making; and\r\nlastly, we have the Chinese for planting, sorting, and preparation of\r\nthe weed. The planting is conducted on a co-operative system. Coolies\r\nhave their fields allotted to them, and plant at their own risk under\r\nsupervision. Their payment depends on the yield. Reckoning from the\r\nestimated out-turn of last year’s crop, and that one coolie will raise\r\nseven piculs of tobacco in the season, we arrive at the figure 23,000 as\r\nrepresenting the total number of Chinese engaged at Deli in tobacco\r\ncultivation, to which number 7000 extra hands must be added, employed in\r\npursuits incidental to the industry. 3000 additional Chinese coolies are\r\nreported to have been engaged for the coming year. The strength of the\r\nKling community may be taken at about 3000. The Chinamen go into their\r\nclearings and begin work during January and February: those not actually\r\nin service on the tobacco estates earning money as shopkeepers, pedlars,\r\nor gardeners, many of the latter being old hands who, under advances,\r\nhave taken to planting patches of tobacco on their own account, for\r\nwhich they find a ready sale in Penang. The Klings are also to be met\r\nwith as drivers of carts and carriages.\r\n\r\n“An industrious coolie would, on an average, net in the course of a year\r\n100 to 150 Dutch florins, and on this sum he pays to the Dutch\r\nGovernment 2 per cent. by way of income tax. The coolie, however,\r\narrives in the country with a debt of from 100 fl. to 150 fl., and thus\r\nas a rule is not clear and able to leave with a balance in hand till the\r\nend of the second year. The coolie is engaged for a year, but he\r\ngenerally re-engages, and takes his departure in the beginning of the\r\nthird year.\r\n\r\n“The Dutch Government regulations with regard to the maintenance of a\r\nmedical man by every estate and to the erection of hospitals for sick\r\ncoolies are stringent; and, on the whole, the coolie-lines, considering\r\ntheir temporary nature, are adequate, so that the lot of the coolie in\r\nDeli may be regarded as a favourable one, even when compared with places\r\nwhere he is under British control.\r\n\r\n“The importing of British Indians, as is well known, is not tolerated,\r\nthough many have found their way into the country under the stimulus of\r\nhigh wages, the latter running from 7 dol. to 10 dol. a month, according\r\nto capacity.”\r\n\r\nThe following report by Consul Eckstein on the export of Sumatran\r\ntobacco to the United States, and Dutch dealings in the same in 1882\r\nwill be of interest.\r\n\r\nConsul Eckstein says “it is not quite three years since a few dealers in\r\ntobacco and manufacturers of cigars in the United States had first their\r\nattention attracted to Sumatra tobacco, with a view of introducing and\r\nusing it for cigar-wrappers.\r\n\r\n“From this port shipments of the article began to be made during the\r\nlatter half of the year 1880, and, considering that this trade has only\r\nso recently taken its rise, and that by this time it has already assumed\r\nrather important proportions, I felt called upon to prepare the present\r\nreport, giving some information concerning the same.\r\n\r\n“In order to show, as nearly correct as possible, the course this trade\r\nhas taken from its commencement to the present time, I made up the\r\nfollowing statement, which exhibits the quantity and value of such\r\ntobacco shipped from Amsterdam to the United States during each quarter\r\nsince such shipments first began to be made, viz.:—\r\n\r\n        ──────────────────────────────┬────────────┬────────────\r\n        Quarters ending—              │Quantities. │   Value.\r\n        ──────────────────────────────┼────────────┼────────────\r\n                                      │   Bales.   │     $\r\n        September 30, 1880            │         311│      37,694\r\n        December 31, 1880             │         454│      52,113\r\n                                      │    ————————│    ————————\r\n        Total                         │         765│      89,807\r\n                                      │    ————————│    ————————\r\n                                      │            │\r\n        March 31, 1881                │       None.│       None.\r\n        June 30, 1881                 │         558│      56,958\r\n        September 30, 1881            │       1,162│     128,474\r\n        December 31, 1881             │       1,059│     114,758\r\n                                      │    ————————│    ————————\r\n        Total                         │       2,779│     300,190\r\n                                      │    ————————│    ————————\r\n                                      │            │\r\n        March 31, 1882                │         496│      52,203\r\n        June 30, 1882                 │       1,464│     140,184\r\n        September 30, 1882            │       2,245│     254,372\r\n        December 31, 1882             │       2,785│     333,254\r\n                                      │    ————————│    ————————\r\n        Total                         │       6,990│     780,013\r\n        ──────────────────────────────┴────────────┴────────────\r\n\r\n“From this statement it will be observed that the export of the article\r\nto the United States is constantly and very largely increasing; and when\r\nit is further taken into account that certain quantities of it were\r\ninvoiced and shipped from Rotterdam and Bremen as well, it may safely be\r\nstated that about 9000 bales of Sumatra tobacco entered our markets in\r\n1882.\r\n\r\n“What has created, increased, and what sustains this trade appears to\r\nbe:\r\n\r\n“1st. That certain qualities of Sumatra tobacco in certain dark colours\r\nhave been found to be peculiarly and advantageously adaptable for\r\ncigar-wrappers, and are gaining more and more in favour with\r\nmanufacturers of cigars in the United States; and\r\n\r\n“2nd. The ever-increasing crops of the article, thus also increasing the\r\nsupply of the particular sorts especially suitable for the American\r\nmarket.\r\n\r\n“The recent animation in this trade has undoubtedly furthermore been\r\nstimulated by the removal of the 10 per cent. discriminating duty,\r\nformerly payable thereon, being a product of the East Indies, exported\r\nfrom the west of the Cape of Good Hope.\r\n\r\n“This will be clearly evident when I state that many shipments,\r\naggregating large quantities of this tobacco, purchased or ordered for\r\nmonths last past, were purposely delayed until late in December, so as\r\nnot to arrive until after the law abolishing the discriminating duty had\r\ngone into effect.\r\n\r\n“This unlooked-for introduction and now so considerable export of this\r\nstaple into the United States has begun to be viewed with great\r\ndisfavour by cultivators or growers of ‘seed-leaf’ tobacco in the United\r\nStates.\r\n\r\n“They apprehend, as I am informed, that the imports of Sumatra tobacco\r\ninto our country will increase still further in the near future, and\r\nseem to consider this would prove greatly detrimental to their\r\ninterests.\r\n\r\n“I am hardly in position or prepared to express an opinion as to how\r\nwell grounded or justified their fears really are, and, moreover, am\r\ninclined to believe that the interested parties are the better judges of\r\nthis matter, but so far as I can possibly make myself serviceable by\r\ngiving information which may assist them in reaching correct conclusions\r\non the subject I deem it my duty to do, and do cheerfully.\r\n\r\n“Such information may possibly also be of some value to Congress in its\r\npresent consideration of our tariff when the article of ‘leaf-tobacco’\r\nis reached.\r\n\r\n“Thus I would report that up to the present the production of the\r\narticle has increased from year to year without any intermission from\r\nthe beginning of its cultivation in Sumatra in 1865, when it amounted to\r\nonly 189 bales.\r\n\r\n“In this connection I would respectfully refer and call attention to my\r\nreport on ‘The tobacco trade of the Netherlands in 1881,’ dated March 7,\r\n1882, and printed in the volume of monthly consular commercial reports\r\nNo. 18, of April last, as it contains a statement showing the crops of\r\nSumatra tobacco each year from 1865 to 1880, inclusive, and the average\r\nprices realized from its sale.\r\n\r\n“The crop of 1881 is represented to have footed up 82,356 bales, valued\r\n(approximately) at 5,791,880 dol., being an increase over the crop of\r\nthe previous year (1880) of 17,433 bales as to quantity, and of\r\n1,260,000 dol. as to the approximate value thereof.\r\n\r\n“From the foregoing it will be seen that about one-ninth of the whole\r\ncrop of 1881 has been exported to the United States.\r\n\r\n“The entire crop, excepting about 1700 bales remaining in the hands of\r\nthe original importers or consignees here, on December 31, 1882, was\r\ndisposed of at an advance of about 1 cent, United States currency, in\r\nthe average price as compared with that realized in 1881 for the crop of\r\n1880; or, in other words, the total crop of 1880 brought on the average\r\nabout 45¾ cents, whereas the crop of 1881 averaged about 46¾ cents,\r\nUnited States currency, per half-kilogram.\r\n\r\n“This refers to the prices originally obtained at the various sales\r\nthroughout the year by the importers or consignees, first hands.\r\n\r\n“As regards the prices for the particular sorts which during the year\r\nfound their way to the United States, and which are usually purchased\r\nfrom quite a number of firms in the wholesale tobacco trade through the\r\nmediation of brokers, they differed all the way from about 45 cents to\r\n95 cents, United States currency, for the half-kilogram.\r\n\r\n“Thinking it might prove interesting, if not important, to parties in\r\nthe United States in any way concerned in this matter, to be informed as\r\nto the extent and quality of the crop of 1882, I made inquiries relating\r\nto it, and ascertained as follows, viz.:—‘That whilst it is impossible\r\nto state, at this early day, with accuracy the yield of the crop, it is\r\ngenerally considered and expected to have been again in excess over the\r\nprevious one, and that it amounts to about 90,000 bales.’\r\n\r\n“Its quality is represented by the planters to be very good, as far as\r\nthey are able to judge; but this can, of course, only be determined\r\nlater on, after the tobacco has gone through the process of\r\nfermentation.\r\n\r\n“The first parcels of this new crop will arrive here about the month of\r\nMarch next, and will be offered for sale about a month or six months\r\nthereafter.\r\n\r\n“In concluding this report, I would remark that the year 1882 has been a\r\nmost favourable one for tobacco planters in Sumatra and for those\r\ninterested in tobacco plantations there, and so have those connected\r\nwith the trade here realized handsomely by the year’s operations.\r\n\r\n“I am, therefore, induced to state that so long as the present general\r\ndemand for the article continues there will be neither lack of capital\r\nnor labour, so long as either can contribute to an increase in its\r\nproduction, and it would seem to be more a question as to the extent of\r\nacreage in Sumatra adapted for its cultivation, as only once in four or\r\nfive years a crop can be raised on the same soil without danger of\r\nproducing a very inferior quality of tobacco.”\r\n\r\n_Turkey._—The Turkish empire has long been known as producing some of\r\nthe finest tobaccos in the world. In the sanjac of Drama, which forms\r\nthe vice-consular district of Cavalla, tobacco is the staple article of\r\nproduction and industry, and some 75,000 acres were devoted to its\r\nculture in 1873. The whole crop of 1871 was reckoned at 11,200,000 lb.,\r\nthe exports having been 7,600,000 lb., value 37,825_l._ The tobacco of\r\nthis district, though derived entirely from one species, is divided into\r\ntwo classes, known as _Drama_ and _Yenidji_. The former leaf is larger,\r\nstouter, and more potent, and generally of deep reddish-brown colour;\r\nthe latter is smaller, slighter, less narcotic, with a peculiarly\r\ndelicate aroma, and the best is of a rich yellow colour, whence its name\r\n“golden-leaf.” The _Drama_ kind is principally grown in the western\r\nportion of the district, and is the class supplied to European markets.\r\nThe differences in the two kinds seem to be due solely to the soil.\r\n\r\nThe plantations in the Drama district proper occupy both plain and\r\nhill-side. The produce of the former is much the more considerable, and\r\nsuperior. The best leaves, distinguished by a stronger and more\r\nsubstantial texture, and a dark-red hue, go to Constantinople; the\r\ninferior and lighter-coloured find a sale in Russia. The mountain\r\nproduct is much inferior in quality and is sent chiefly to Europe. When\r\nthe leaves are petiolate, or furnished with stems, they are made up in\r\n_manoks_ (“hands”) of 10–15, and termed _bashi-baghli_ (“head-tied”);\r\nwhen the leaves are sessile, or devoid of stems, they are simply pressed\r\ntogether in small numbers, and called _bassma_. The whole produce of\r\nthis locality varies from 2,100,000 to 2,450,000 lb. yearly. The growth\r\nobtained in the Vale of Pravista is known as _Demirli_. It is inferior,\r\nunsubstantial, and dark-coloured, and usually made up as _bashi-baghli_.\r\nThe annual production is about 2 million lb.; the exports to England\r\nwere 1,600,000 lb. in 1871. Cavalla affords yearly about 300,000 lb. of\r\ninferior quality, chiefly as _bashi-baghli_, and mostly consumed\r\nlocally. The shipping port for all these places is Cavalla.\r\n\r\nThe district of Sarishaban produces on the average about 2,000,000 lb.\r\nannually, but the crop of 1871 reached 2,800,000 lb. About ⅞ is as\r\n_bashi-baghli_. That grown on the plain and hills is termed _ghynbek_,\r\nand forms the bulk; that from the slopes, about 500,000 lb. a year, is\r\nthe best, and is known as _ghubek_. All is packed up in small _boghchas_\r\n(parcels), of 30–50 lb., which are distinguished as _béyaz_, from the\r\nwhite cotton wrappers used for the best sort, and _kenavir_, from the\r\ncanvas coverings of the inferior kinds. The best goes to Constantinople,\r\nsecondary to Smyrna and other home markets, and the worst to Europe. The\r\ndistrict of Yenidji, near the Gulf of Lagos, affords some 3,500,000 lb.\r\nper annum, chiefly as _bassma_, and bearing a very general resemblance\r\nto the produce of Sarishaban. The best goes to Constantinople and\r\nRussia. Ghiumirgina (Ghumurdjina, or Komuldsina) grows about 300,000 lb.\r\nyearly of dark-coloured _bassma_, of the _Drama_ class, which is used\r\nlocally; and Sultan-Yeri gives 400,000 lb. of still darker\r\n_bashi-baghli_. The produce of these districts is shipped at Lagos\r\n(Karagatch) or Cavalla.\r\n\r\nThe most delicate and valued of all the tobaccos raised in this portion\r\nof European Turkey is the celebrated “golden leaf” from the caza of\r\nYenidji, on the Yardar (Nestus) river. After it, in declining order,\r\ncome the products of Drama, Persoccian, Sarishaban, Cavalla, and\r\nPravista. Of the whole Drama and Yenidji produce, it is estimated that\r\nAustro-Hungary takes 40 per cent. Italy buys annually about\r\n150,000–200,000 _kilo._ France, Germany, and Switzerland receive very\r\nlittle. Russia is a large customer. Before the war, considerable\r\nquantities were sent to the countries on the Lower Danube. England\r\nimports every year some 10,000 bales, or 400,000 _okes_ (of 2·83 lb.) of\r\nPravista tobacco. The _refusa_, or waste leaves, &c., is sent everywhere\r\nfor making into cigarettes, most largely perhaps to Egypt. A kind of\r\ntobacco known as _ayiasoulouk_ is grown in considerable quantities in\r\nthe opium districts, almost exclusively for export to Europe, the\r\nnatives having a strong prejudice against it.\r\n\r\nThe necessity for manuring is well understood by the Turks. They dress\r\nthe seed-beds with goat- and sheep-dung, and manure the fields during\r\nwinter with horse- and cattle-dung. In the spring, sheep and goats are\r\nfolded on the land. The soil of tobacco lands will be found quite\r\nimpregnated with, ammonia and nitrate of potash, both absorbed by the\r\nplant; the former is thought to influence the aroma, and the latter may\r\nbe seen in crystals on the surface of the dried leaf. In order to keep\r\nthe leaves small and delicate, the planting is performed very close, the\r\nusual distances being 5 inches apart, and 9 inches between the rows.\r\n\r\nThe district of Latakia, in the northern part of Syria, has long been\r\ncelebrated for its tobacco, which is the chief product of the\r\nmountainous part. There are several kinds:—(1) _Abu Riha_ or _Dgebeli_,\r\nfound in its best state among the mountains of the Nesseries (Ansaries),\r\nwhich possesses a peculiar and much-admired aroma, derived from its\r\nbeing exposed, from November to April, to the smoke of fires of _ozer_\r\n(_Quercus Ilex_, or _Q. Cerris_); (2) _Dgidar_, including a number of\r\nkinds, of medium strength, and in great favour locally on account of its\r\nlow price; (3) _Scheik-el-Bent_, almost equal to _Abu-Riha_, and often\r\nsubstituted for it.\r\n\r\nThe plain of Koura is remarkable for its tobaccos, which are rather\r\nstrong, but much admired. The villages of Lebail and Serai produce\r\nbetter tobacco than Koura. The district of Gebail (Gebel) in Kesrasan\r\n(Castravan) affords the best and dearest tobacco in Syria; it is very\r\nbrittle, and its ash is quite white. The country south of Lebanon yields\r\nvery ordinary qualities, known as _Salili_, _Tanoné_, and _Takibé_, or\r\ngenerically as _Berraoni_; these are mixed with stronger kinds for use.\r\nThe best of the _Abu-Riha_ is yielded by the plant called\r\n_Karn-el-Gazel_; the second quality is termed _Bonati_.\r\n\r\nThe exports of tobacco from Alexandretta in 1879 were:—To Egypt, 91\r\ntons, value 6380_l._; Turkey, 24 tons, 1920_l._; England, 51 tons,\r\n2550_l._; France, 1 ton, 80_l._ The exports from Aleppo in 1878 were 30\r\ntons, value 1200_l._, to Great Britain. The yield of the crop in\r\nThessaly was 1,116,000 _okes_ (of 2·83 lb.) in 1877, 210,000 in 1878,\r\nand 890,000 in 1879. The crop of Prevesa in 1878 was 4000 _okes_, value\r\n215_l._ The exports from Dedeagatch were about 260 bales, value\r\n1000_l._, in 1878; and 600 bales, value 2400_l._, in 1879. Considerable\r\nquantities are grown around Sinope. Tobacco is one of the principal\r\nproducts of the district of Samsoun, and is of good quality. The average\r\nyield is 7,000,000 lb. yearly. It is grown near the sea-shore, and not\r\neastward of Yomurah, at Matchka and Trebizonde, and especially at\r\nAkché-Abad. But the aggregate crop in these localities is hardly ⅓ of\r\nthe quantity produced at Samsoun, and the quality is far inferior. The\r\nSamsoun product is usually purchased largely on account of the French\r\nGovernment. The exports from Samsoun in 1878 were:—To Turkey, 2,680,000\r\n_kilo._, value 160,800_l._; France, 583,500 _kilo._, 28,008_l._; Russia,\r\n575,000 _kilo._, 57,500_l._; Germany, 400,000 _kilo._, 7200_l._;\r\nAustria, 327,220 _kilo._, 31,266_l._; Great Britain, 87,567 _kilo._,\r\n1576_l._; total, 4,653,287 _kilo._, 286,350_l._ The exports of\r\nTurkey-produced tobacco from Trebizonde in 1879 were:—To Turkey, 14,864\r\ncwt., value 44,592_l._; Russia, 866 cwt., 2598_l._; Great Britain, 490\r\ncwt., 1470_l._; Austria and Germany, 204 cwt., 612_l._; total, 16,424\r\ncwt., 49,272_l._\r\n\r\nIn 1884, Damascus imported 1313 sacks of tumbeki, value 1674_l._, from\r\nBagdad. In the same year Erzeroum imported 9000 _okes_, value 1090_l._,\r\nfrom Persia.\r\n\r\nThe leaf grown by the Herki Kurds and other cultivators in and around\r\nthe district of Shemdina is highly prized in Persia. In 1884, the first\r\nyear of their operations, the employés of the tobacco Régie only\r\nsucceeded in registering a yield of 25,000 _okes_, but this amount\r\nrepresents less than a fifth of the estimated produce of the vilayet. It\r\nis believed, however, that 8000–10,000_l._ Turkish worth of Shemdina\r\ntobacco annually crosses the frontier into Persia.\r\n\r\nTrebizonde exports in 1884 were 20,167 cwt., value 56,849_l._ Inferior\r\nqualities are sent to Europe, good ones remain in Turkey, and the best\r\ngo to Egypt.\r\n\r\nThe shipments from Samsoun in 1884 were as follows:—\r\n\r\n              ────────────────┬────────┬────────┬────────\r\n                              │        │ Price. │\r\n                              │  cwt.  │£. s. d.│   £\r\n              To Turkey       │  29,210│4  0  0 │ 116,840\r\n                 Austria      │   8,540│5  0  0 │  42,700\r\n                 France       │   5,756│1  4  2 │  11,512\r\n                 Egypt        │   4,176│4  0  0 │  16,704\r\n                 Germany      │   3,579│1  8  6 │   5,096\r\n                 Russia       │   1,730│6  0  0 │  10,380\r\n                 Great Britain│     832│1  4  2 │   1,002\r\n                 Holland      │     712│1 12  0 │   1,140\r\n                 Greece       │     416│3  0  0 │   1,248\r\n                              │ ———————│        │ ———————\r\n                              │  54,951│        │ 206,622\r\n              ────────────────┴────────┴────────┴────────\r\n\r\n_United States._—The United States of America occupy the foremost rank\r\namong tobacco-growing countries. The areas and productions have been as\r\nfollows:—1875, 559,049 acres, 379,347,000 lb.; 1876, 540,457 acres,\r\n381,002,000 lb.; 1877, 720,344 acres, 489,000,000 lb.; 1878, 542,850\r\nacres, 392,546,700 lb. The crop of 1875 (in millions of lb.) was thus\r\ncontributed:—Kentucky, 130; Virginia, 57; Missouri, 40; Tennessee, 35;\r\nMaryland, 22; Pennsylvania, 16; N. Carolina, 14¾; Ohio, 13½; Indiana,\r\n12¾; Connecticut, 10; Massachusetts, 8½; Illinois, 8. The average yields\r\n(in lb. per acre) of the various districts in 1875 were:—Connecticut,\r\n1600; Pennsylvania, 1600; New Hampshire, 1600; Massachusetts, 1350;\r\nMissouri, 850; Arkansas, 822; New York, 800; Florida, 750; Ohio, 700; W.\r\nVirginia, 680; Maryland, 675; Tennessee, 675; Kansas, 670; Texas, 650;\r\nKentucky, 630; Virginia, 630; Illinois, 550; Georgia, 550; N. Carolina,\r\n500; Indiana, 500; Wisconsin, 500; Alabama, 465; Mississippi, 317. The\r\nexports from New York in 1878 were:—37,484 hogsheads, 2561 bales, and\r\n2,218,200 lb. manufactured, to Great Britain; 15,570 hh., 207 bales, and\r\n14,800 lb. manufactured, to France; 35,700 hh., 78,331 bales, and\r\n147,400 lb. manufactured, to N. Europe ; 23,150 hh., 6058 bales, and\r\n120,000 lb. manufactured, to other Europe; 4628 hh., 14,360 bales, and\r\n4,780,200 lb. manufactured, to S. America, E. and W. Indies, &c.\r\nBaltimore exported 66,039 hh. in 1878. The shipments from New Orleans in\r\n1877–8 were:—1226 hh. to Great Britain, 743 to France, 4552 to N.\r\nEurope, 3222 to S. Europe, Mexico, &c., and 4500 coastwise.\r\nPhiladelphia, in 1879, exported 9,564,171 lb. of leaf tobacco, 52,000\r\ncigars, and 515 lb. of snuff. The total American export of\r\nunmanufactured leaf in 1879 was 322,280,000 lb.\r\n\r\nThe census bulletin on this branch of industry, recently issued, is of a\r\nvery interesting nature. The tobacco product in the United States is\r\ndivided into classes, types and grades, the basis of a class being its\r\nadaptation to any specific purpose; of a type, to certain qualities or\r\nproperties in the leaf, such as colour, strength, elasticity, body or\r\nflavour. It also applies to the method of curing, such as sun, air or\r\nflue curing. Grades represent the different qualities of a type, and\r\nvary much in the several types. The classification of American tobacco\r\nis threefold, viz. domestic cigar tobacco and “smokers,”\r\nchewing-tobacco, export tobacco. The domestic tobacco trade comprises\r\nthe various kinds of seed-leaf of Connecticut, New England,\r\nPennsylvania, Wisconsin, Illinois, New York, Florida and Ohio, as well\r\nas the sorts known as White Burley “lugs,” fine-fibred wrappers, Indiana\r\nkite foot, and American-grown Havana. In the chewing class are included\r\nthe fine-cut and the plug fillers, principally of the White Burley type\r\nfrom Kentucky, while under the head of export tobacco are the Virginian\r\nbird’s-eye cutting leaf, and the spinning fillers or shag. It is curious\r\nto notice how each market for export tobacco differs in its\r\nrequirements. The “closed” markets, or those in which the tobacco trade\r\nis a monopoly of the Government, are France, Italy, Austria and Spain.\r\nThe French “Régie” is supplied by wrappers, binders and fillers from\r\nKentucky, Maryland and Ohio; the Italian Régie from Kentucky and\r\nVirginia; the Austrian Régie by “strips” from the same States, and the\r\nSpanish Régie by common “lugs.” The open markets are Germany, to which\r\nare sent the tobaccos known as German saucer and spinners; Ohio and\r\nMaryland, spangled cigar-wrappers and “smokers” fat lugs; Switzerland,\r\nwhich is supplied with Virginian or Western wrappers and fillers;\r\nHolland, with Dutch saucer (a mottled Virginia, Kentucky or Tennessee\r\nleaf); Belgium, with Belgian cutter (a light, yellowish-brown leaf, well\r\nfired); Norway and Sweden, with heavy types, mainly used for spinning\r\nand “saucing.” Kentucky, which stands first of all the States for\r\nproduction, the annual produce being 171,120,784 lb., gains her chief\r\nprofits from the white burley and yellow wrapper; Illinois, from the\r\nproduction of the seed-leaf; Missouri, from sweet fillers and white\r\nburley; Virginia, from yellow wrappers, bright “smokers,” sun, air and\r\nflue-cured fillers. Decidedly the most prosperous tobacco States are\r\nthose that grow types suitable for domestic consumption, while those\r\nthat grow it mainly for exportation stand low in the scale, the margin\r\nof profit under this head being reduced very low. According to the\r\nresearches of Dr. Gideon Moore, the largest amount of nicotine is\r\ncontained in the Virginian heavily manured lots (5·81 per cent.), while\r\nthe Virginian heavy English shipping has 4·72, the New York domestic\r\nHavana but 2·53, the Connecticut seed-leaf 1·14, while the smallest\r\namount of all is found in the little Dutch tobacco of the Miami valley,\r\n0·63. Profits in the culture of tobacco have been in direct\r\nproportion—first to its suitableness to domestic consumption; and,\r\nsecondly, to the amount of fertilization practised by the growers in its\r\ncultivation. This is true in every case, except the yellow tobacco\r\ndistricts of North Carolina and Virginia, where poverty in the soil is a\r\ncondition of success in the production of quality.\r\n\r\nProfessor J. T. Rothrock is of the opinion that the early natives of\r\nCalifornia smoked the leaves of _Nicotiana clevelandii_—a species only\r\nquite recently described by Professor Asa Gray. It is a small plant with\r\nsmall flowers, and it was found by Professor Rothrock only in\r\nassociation with the shell heaps which occur so abundantly on the coasts\r\nof Southern and Central California. He states that perhaps of all the\r\nremains of extinct races so richly furnished by that region, none were\r\nso common as the pipes, usually made of stone resembling serpentine. The\r\ntobacco of _N. clevelandii_ Professor Rothrock found by experience to be\r\nexcessively strong.\r\n\r\nA recent report of the Commissioner of Agriculture contains a few pages\r\nof sound advice to American planters on the management of this crop,\r\nwhich is worthy of reproduction here.\r\n\r\n“The principal points to be attended to if the best results are to be\r\nattained may be stated in a few paragraphs—paragraphs which, while\r\nreferring mainly to shipping, manufacturing, and smoking tobacco as\r\nconstituting nine-tenths of the tobacco grown in the United States,\r\nembody principles and prescribe modes of management nearly identical\r\nwith those to be considered in the treatment of other tobaccos.\r\n\r\n“I. Select good land for the crop; plough and subsoil it _in autumn_ to\r\nget the multiplied benefits of winter’s freezes. This cannot be too\r\nstrongly urged.\r\n\r\n“II. Have early and vigorous plants and _plenty of them_. It were better\r\nto have 100,000 too many than 10,000 too few. They are the corner-stone\r\nof the building. To make sure of them give personal attention to the\r\nselection and preparation of the plant-bed and to the care of the young\r\nplants in the means necessary to hasten their growth, and to protect\r\nthem from the dreaded fly.\r\n\r\n“III. Collect manure in season and out of season, and from every\r\navailable source—from the fence corners, the ditch-banks, the urinal,\r\nthe ash-pile. Distribute it with a liberal hand; nothing short of\r\nprincely liberality will answer. Plough it under (both the home-made and\r\nthe commercial) in _February_, that it may become thoroughly\r\nincorporated in the soil and be ready to answer to the first and every\r\ncall of the growing plant. Often (we believe generally) the greater part\r\nof manure applied to tobacco—and this is true of the ‘bought’ fertilizer\r\nas well as of that made on the farm—is lost to that crop from being\r\napplied too late. Don’t wait to apply your dearly-purchased guano in the\r\nhill or the drill from fear that, if applied sooner, it will vanish into\r\nthin air before the plant needs it. This is an exploded fallacy.\r\nExperience, our best teacher, has demonstrated beyond cavil that stable\r\nand commercial manure are most efficacious when used in conjunction. In\r\nno other way can they be so intimately intermixed as by ploughing them\r\nunder—the one broadcasted on the other—at an early period of the\r\npreparation of the tobacco lot. This second ploughing should not be so\r\ndeep as the first; an average of three to four inches is about the right\r\ndepth.\r\n\r\n“IV. Early in May (in the main tobacco belt to which this article\r\nchiefly refers, that is to say, between the thirty-fifth and fortieth\r\nparallels of north latitude), re-plough the land to about the depth of\r\nthe February ploughing, and drag and cross-drag, and, if need be, drag\r\nit again, until the soil is brought to the finest possible tilth. Thus\r\nyou augment many fold the probabilities of a ‘stand’ on the first\r\nplanting, and lessen materially the subsequent labour of cultivation.\r\nPlant on ‘lists’ (narrow beds made by throwing four furrows together\r\nwith the mould-board plough) rather than in hills, if for no other\r\nreason than that having now, if never before, to pay wages in some shape\r\nto labour, whenever and wherever possible horse-power should be\r\nsubstituted for man-power—the plough for the hoe.\r\n\r\n“V. Plant as early as possible after a continuance of pleasant spring\r\nweather is assured. Seek to have a _forward_ crop, as the benefits\r\nclaimed for a late one from the fall dews do not compensate for the many\r\nadvantages resulting from early maturity. Make it an inflexible rule to\r\nplant no tobacco after the 10th of July—we mean, of course, in the\r\ntobacco belt we have named. Where one good crop is made from later\r\nplanting ninety-nine prove utter failures. Far better _rub out and start\r\nafresh the next year_. Take pains in transplanting, that little or no\r\nreplanting may be necessary. The cut-worm being a prime cause of most of\r\nthe trouble in securing a stand, hunt it assiduously and particularly in\r\nthe early morning when it can most readily be found.\r\n\r\n“VI. Keep the grass and weeds down, and the soil loose and mellow by\r\nfrequent stirring, avoiding as much as possible cutting and tearing the\r\nroots of the plant in all stages of its growth, and more especially\r\nafter _topping_. When at all practicable—and, with the great improvement\r\nin cultivators, sweeps, and other farm implements, it is oftener\r\npracticable than generally supposed—substitute for hand-work in\r\ncultivation that of the horse. The difference in cost will tell in the\r\nbalance-sheet at the close of the operation.\r\n\r\n“VII. Attend closely to ‘worming,’ for on it hinges in no little degree\r\nthe quality and quantity of tobacco you will have for sale. A worm-eaten\r\ncrop brings no money. So important is this operation that it may\r\nproperly claim more than a passing notice. Not only is it the most\r\ntedious, the most unremitting, and the most expensive operation\r\nconnected with the production of tobacco, but the necessity for it\r\ndetermines more than all other causes the limit of the crop which in\r\ngeneral it has been found possible for a single hand to manage.\r\nTherefore bring to your aid every possible adjunct in diminishing the\r\nnumber of worms. Use poison for killing the moth in the manner so\r\nfrequently described in treatises on tobacco, to wit, by injecting a\r\nsolution of cobalt or other deadly drug into the flower of the Jamestown\r\nor ‘jimson’ weed (_Datura stramonium_), if necessary planting seeds of\r\nthe weed for the purpose. Employ at night the flames of lamps, of\r\ntorches, or of huge bonfires, in which the moth may find a quick and\r\ncertain death.\r\n\r\n“In worming, spare those worms found covered with a white film or\r\nnet-like substance, this being the cocoon producing the ichneumon-fly,\r\nan enemy to the worm likely to prove a valuable ally to the planter in\r\nhis war of extermination.\r\n\r\n“Turn your flock of turkeys into the tobacco-field, that they, too, may\r\nprey upon the pest, and themselves grow fat in so doing.\r\n\r\n“If these remedies should fail, sprinkle diluted spirits of turpentine\r\nover the plant through the rose of a watering-pot, a herculean task\r\ntruly in a large crop, but mere child’s play to the hand-picking\r\nprocess, for the one sprinkling suffices to keep off the worms for all\r\ntime, whereas the hand-picking is a continual round of expensive labour\r\nfrom the appearance of the first worm until the last plant has been\r\ncarried to the barn. We have no idea that such sprinkling will at all\r\naffect the odour or flavour of the tobacco when cured.\r\n\r\n“If, as stated by a writer in a California paper, the well-known\r\n‘yellow-jacket’ be useful in destroying tobacco-worms, by all means win\r\nit as an ally. As proving its usefulness, the writer asserts that one of\r\nhis neighbours, a Mr. Culp, daring fifteen years growing tobacco, has\r\nnever expended a dollar for labour to destroy the worm, trusting all to\r\nthis little workman, who, he says, carefully searches the plants for the\r\nworms, and never allows one to escape its vigilance.\r\n\r\n“We cannot speak from our own experience as to many of these suggested\r\nmeans for overcoming the horn-worm, but we have no hesitation in saying\r\nto the farmer, try any, try all of them rather than have your crop eaten\r\nto shreds, and the labour of more than half the year brought to naught\r\nin a few days, it may be, by a single ‘glut’ of worms.\r\n\r\n“VIII. ‘Prime high and top low.’ While open to objection in particular\r\ncases, even with the character of tobacco chiefly under consideration,\r\nand altogether inadmissible, it may be, in the management of other\r\nvarieties of tobacco, this is a safe rule, we think, to follow in\r\ngeneral practice.\r\n\r\n“We favour ‘priming’ by all means; for when no priming is done the lower\r\nleaves (made worthless by constant whipping on the ground) serve only as\r\na harbour for worms, which are the more difficult to find because of the\r\nincreased burden of stooping. Moreover, if the bottom leaves be saved on\r\nthe cut stalk, as most likely they will be, there is always the\r\ntemptation to put them on the market; and against a _sacrilege_ like\r\nthis we are firmly set, let others say and think what they may.\r\n\r\n“Yet another advantage to be gained by the removal of these bottom\r\nleaves, which is what the planter terms ‘priming,’ is the increased\r\ncirculation of air and distribution of light thereby afforded, both\r\nessential factors, the merest tyro knows, to the full development of\r\nplant life.\r\n\r\n“‘Topping’ (the pinching off with the finger-nail the bud at the top of\r\nthe plant) is an operation requiring considerable skill and judgment.\r\nLet it be performed only by hands having these prerequisites.\r\n\r\n“That as many plants as possible may ripen at the same time (a\r\ndesideratum not to be undervalued in aiming, as all should, at a\r\n_uniform_ crop) wait until a large number of plants begin to button\r\nbefore commencing to top. Going about through the crop, topping a plant\r\nhere and there because it may chance to have buttoned before its\r\nfellows, is a damaging process not to be tolerated.\r\n\r\n“No inflexible rule can be given for the number of leaves that should be\r\nleft on a plant. All depends upon the variety of tobacco, the strength\r\nof the soil, the promise of the particular plant, the probable seasons\r\nand time left for ripening, &c.\r\n\r\n“One of the most successful growers of heavy dark tobacco we have ever\r\nknown, once stated to us his conviction, after years of observation and\r\npractice, that one year with another, taking the seasons as they come,\r\neight leaves would give a better result than any other number. Our own\r\nexperience has tended to confirm this judgment.\r\n\r\n“IX. See to it that the suckers are promptly removed. It is work quickly\r\ndone, and with worming may constitute a single operation.\r\n\r\n“X. We come now to consider the last operation in the field, ‘cutting’\r\nthe crop. In this, as in topping, a man of judgment, experience, and\r\nfidelity is needed. An inexperienced hand, one without judgment, and\r\nparticularly one who is indifferent to the interests of his employer,\r\nwill slash away, right and left, not knowing or not caring whether the\r\ntobacco he cuts be ripe or green, doing more damage in a few hours than\r\nhis whole year’s wages would compensate for, even could they be\r\ngarnished.\r\n\r\n“Therefore, be on hand to see for yourself, and do not delegate the duty\r\nto any less interested party, that a crop managed well, it may be, so\r\nfar, from the initial plant-bed, should not be spoiled in the closing\r\nwork by an incompetent or unfaithful cutter.\r\n\r\n“Be there, too, to see, in this supreme hour, that injury from sunburn\r\nis warded off by the timely removal, to the shade, of the plants that\r\nhave been cut, or by a proper covering, where they lie, against the\r\nscorching rays of the sun. The neglect of this precaution has played\r\nhavoc with many a crop when brought under the auctioneer’s hammer.\r\n\r\n“XI. We should have no space to describe the different methods of\r\n‘curing’ tobacco, as, for instance, ‘sun-curing,’ ‘air-curing,’\r\n‘flue-curing,’ ‘open-fire-curing,’ &c., even though the whole subject\r\nhad not been gone over again and again in previous reports of this\r\nDepartment. We can only say of this operation, as of all others\r\nconnected with the production of tobacco, that much depends on its\r\nproper doing, and that, as much as possible, it should have the personal\r\nsuperintendence of the owner.\r\n\r\n“But the crop may have been brought along successfully even to the\r\ncompletion of this operation and ‘lack one thing yet,’ if it be not now\r\nproperly manipulated.\r\n\r\n“Therefore, go yourself, brother planter, into your barns, see with your\r\nown eyes, and not through the medium of others; handle with your own\r\nhands, and _know of a surety_ that the tobacco hanging on the tier-poles\r\nis in proper order for ‘striking’ and ‘bulking,’ and act accordingly.\r\n\r\n“When, later on, it is being ‘stripped,’ ‘sorted,’ and tied into\r\nbundles, or ‘hands,’ as they are often called, be there again, _propria\r\npersona_, to see that it is properly classed, both as to colour and to\r\nlength, the ‘lugs’ going with lugs, the ‘short’ with short, the ‘long’\r\nwith long, &c. Instruct those sorting that when in doubt as to where a\r\nparticular leaf should be put, to put it at least one grade lower than\r\nthey had thought of doing. Thus any error will be on the safe side.\r\n\r\n“Prize in hogsheads to weigh what is usually called for in the market in\r\nwhich you sell, and, above all, ‘let the tobacco in each hogshead be as\r\nnear alike as possible, uniform throughout, so that the ‘sample,’ from\r\nwhatever point it may be taken, can be relied on as representing the\r\nwhole hogshead,’ and that there be left no shadow of suspicion that\r\n‘nesting’ has been attempted, or any dishonest practice even so much as\r\nwinked at.\r\n\r\n“We sum up the whole matter by repeating:\r\n\r\n“1. That overproduction, the production at all, of _low_ grade tobacco\r\nis the chief cause of the present extremely low price of the entire\r\ncommodity.\r\n\r\n“2. That the planters of the United States have the remedy in their own\r\nhands; that remedy being the reduction of area, this reduction to\r\nresult, from the employment of the means here suggested, in increased\r\ncrops; and, paradoxical as it may seem, these increased crops to bring\r\ngreatly enhanced values.\r\n\r\n“The whole world wants good tobacco, and will pay well for it. Scarcely\r\na people on earth seeks poor tobacco or will buy it at any price.\r\n\r\n“In a word, then, one acre must be made to yield what it has hitherto\r\ntaken two or three acres to produce; and this double or treble quantity\r\nmust be made (as, indeed, under good management it could not fail to be)\r\nimmeasurably superior in quality to that now grown on the greater number\r\nof acres. Either this or the abandonment of the crop altogether—one or\r\nthe other.”\r\n\r\nThe exports from Baltimore were 46,239 hogsheads in 1882, 43,620 in\r\n1883, 43,192 in 1884. The State of New York, in 1883, had 5440 acres\r\nunder tobacco, producing 9,068,789 lb., value 1,178,943 dollars; and\r\nConnecticut, 8145 acres, 9,576,824 lb., 1,292,871 dollars. The\r\nproduction of Minnesota was 65,089 lb. in 1879, 48,437 lb. in 1880,\r\n79,631 lb. in 1881, 62,859 lb. in 1882, 14,744 lb. in 1883.\r\n\r\n_Venezuela._—The exports from Ciudad Bolivar were, in 1884, 1318\r\n_kilo._, value 1037 _bolivares_, to the British West Indies; 9618\r\n_kilo._, 6691 _bolivares_, to the United States; 275,329 _kilo._,\r\n192,188 _bolivares_, to Germany. The exports of tobacco from this port\r\nin decades have been:—7,650,656 lb. in 1850–59; 2,134,711 in 1860–69;\r\n3,170,812 in 1870–79.\r\n\r\n_West Indies._—The Spanish possessions in the West Indies are well known\r\nfor their tobacco. The best is produced on the _vuelta abajo_, or\r\nlow-lying districts of Cuba, near Havana, which are yearly flooded\r\nduring the autumn, just before the tobacco is transplanted. To this\r\nfact, and the peculiar suitability of the seasons, the excellence of\r\nthis particular product is attributed. The exports from Havana in 1878\r\nwere:—93,603 bales tobacco, 75,212,268 cigars, 203,581 bundles\r\ncigarettes, to the United States; 6169 bales tobacco, 66,795,330 cigars,\r\n5,034,774 bundles cigarettes, to England; 32,582 bales tobacco,\r\n9,541,498 cigars, 133,008 bundles cigarettes, to Spain; 582 bales\r\ntobacco, 3,861,700 cigars, 8206 bundles cigarettes, to N. Europe; 5671\r\nbales tobacco, 18,327,025 cigars, 797,513 bundles cigarettes, to France;\r\n41 bales tobacco, 900,850 cigars, 5,709,442 bundles cigarettes, to other\r\ncountries. The totals for 1878 were 7,078,904 _kilo._ of tobacco,\r\n182,356 thousand cigars, and 12,816,903 packets of cigarettes; in 1879,\r\n6,371,014 _kilo._ of tobacco, 145,885 thousand cigars, and 14,098,693\r\npackets of cigarettes. The tobacco exports in 1879 from St. Jago de Cuba\r\nwere 9653 bales to Bremen, 4015 to the United States (chiefly for\r\nBremen), and 1809 coastwise, total 15,477, against 10,249 in 1878. In\r\nthe island of Puerto Rico, the tobacco-plant thrives well, and the\r\nquality, especially in the Rio de la Plata district, is very good. In\r\n1878, the island exported 8 _quintals_ (of 101½ lb.) to the United\r\nStates, 32,109 to Spain, 4198 to Germany, and 18,123 to other countries.\r\n\r\nThe British West Indies have only recently appreciated the importance of\r\ntobacco cultivation. Many portions of Jamaica seem as well fitted for it\r\nas the _vuelta abajo_ of Cuba, and already Jamaica tobacco in the\r\nHamburg market ranks next to the best Havana, and is considered superior\r\nto such Cuban growths as St. Jago, Manzanillo, Yara, &c. Tobacco\r\ncultivation may now be said to have a place in the industries of\r\nJamaica, a fact mainly due to Cuban refugees. The most extensive\r\nplantations in the island are Potosi in St. Thomas Parish, and Morgan’s\r\nValley in Clarendon. Much of the produce goes to the German market, the\r\nremainder being made into cigars for local consumption, and said to be\r\nquite equal to some of the best Cuban brands. Some experiments made with\r\nBhilsa tobacco have given great satisfaction, on account of the robust\r\nhabit and immense yield of the plant. It is especially adapted for very\r\nwet districts, and its cultivation will be widely extended, if justified\r\nby its market value. Tobacco is, and for very many years has been, grown\r\nby the peasantry in small patches; from this, they manufacture a\r\nsmoke-dried leaf, which, twisted together in rope form, sells readily in\r\nthe home market. The acreage occupied by the crop was 297 in 1874–5, 442\r\nin 1875–6, 331 in 1876–7, and 380 in 1877–8. The slopes of valleys in\r\nmany parts of Dominica, too, are eminently suited to this crop,\r\nparticularly the district between Roseau and Grand Bay. The experiment\r\nof tobacco culture in New Providence on a large scale has not proved\r\nsatisfactory, owing to the difficulties encountered in curing and\r\npreparing the leaf; the cigars made are fit only for local consumption.\r\n\r\nThe exports from San Domingo in 1884 were 10,513,940 lb., value 669,500\r\ndollars.\r\n\r\nAccording to a recent Consular Report, it would seem that “Cuban tobacco\r\nhas lost its prestige through forcing and artificial manures, and has to\r\nsustain sharp competition from abroad where it formerly commanded the\r\nmarket; and probably some years must elapse before the soil can recover\r\nfrom the excessive and indiscriminate use of artificial fertilizers.\r\n\r\n“A few years ago the leaf harvested in the Vuelta Abajo was not\r\nsufficient to meet the large demand, and in order to increase the yield,\r\ngrowers made use of guanos of all sorts, and with such bad results that\r\nthey find it now difficult to place on reasonable terms more than half,\r\nand sometimes less, of their crops, at very low prices; in few\r\nlocalities only the soil has not been spoilt by spurious manures, and\r\nthe leaf grown there commands very high prices and is warmly competed\r\nfor by local manufacturers and buyers for the United States.\r\n\r\n“Notwithstanding the last crop has been of a better quality than\r\nheretofore, growers were compelled to abandon the tobacco cultivation\r\nfor a certain time, and devote the ground to other purposes.\r\n\r\n“It appears that this change of cultivation is absorbing the\r\nfertilizers, and restoring to the soil its former good qualities, and,\r\nif one can judge from the splendid appearance of the leaf and the ready\r\nsale it now meets with, it would seem that the Vuelta Abajo fields are\r\nregaining their former renown.\r\n\r\n“This has been a hard but healthy lesson the Vegueros are not likely to\r\nforget. The soil cannot and should not be taxed beyond a reasonable and\r\nnatural yield; any attempt to the contrary would only be a repetition of\r\nthe fable of the golden eggs, as the tobacco growers in the Vuelta Abajo\r\nhave had occasion to learn to their cost.\r\n\r\n“Towards the end of the year buyers, influenced by the pending\r\nnegotiations of the Spanish-American Treaty, entered the market and\r\noperated extensively in the expectation of a great reduction of duties\r\nin the United States, paying prices above the established one, and\r\nwhich, a few weeks later, they were utterly unable to obtain.\r\n\r\n“Cuban growers complain much of heavy purchases made in the United\r\nStates for account of the Spanish Government for Peninsular consumption;\r\nthey say that however low the class of the Cuban leaf may be, it must\r\nnecessarily be superior to that of the Virginia and Kentucky tobacco,\r\nand that they might easily cultivate here the quality required, and\r\nplace it in the markets at as low a price as any other country.\r\n\r\n“Growers are unanimous in denouncing the action of some local merchants\r\nand cigar manufacturers in forwarding at the opening of the last season\r\nsamples of leaf tobacco and cigars in condition that by no means gave a\r\ntrue idea of the quality of the crop, and which necessarily gave a\r\nresult contrary to the interests of all parties engaged in the trade;\r\nand they earnestly protest against a repetition of this injudicious\r\nhaste.\r\n\r\n“The total tobacco production is estimated at between 400,000 and\r\n500,000 _quintals_ (one _quintal_ about 100 lb.), chiefly from the\r\nfollowing districts:—\r\n\r\n                                                  Tercios.\r\n\r\n        Vuelta Abajo and semi Vuelta Abajo   150,000 to  200,000\r\n        Parlida                               30,000      50,000\r\n        Remedios                              60,000      85,000\r\n        Cuba and Java                         25,000      35,000\r\n        Gibara                                20,000      30,000\r\n                                       Total 285,000     400,000\r\n                       (One tercio about 124 lb.)\r\n\r\n“As is well known, that grown in the Vuelta Abajo or district west of\r\nHavana is the best kind, and has given Cuba its well-earned reputation.\r\nAbout 67,000 acres are cultivated under the denomination.\r\n\r\n“I have no reliable statistics to show how much of the raw produce is\r\nmanufactured in the island, probably not more than one-fourth. Very\r\nlarge quantities of the leaf are exported in bales and rolled abroad.\r\n\r\n“It is evident, however, that, given the total production and\r\ncorresponding result in the manufactured form, but a small portion of\r\nthe cigars sold in Europe and elsewhere as Havana cigars have the\r\nslightest claim to a connection with Cuba.\r\n\r\n“The chief and only important manufactories of these cigars are in\r\nHavana, and much care and money is expended in producing a\r\nhandsome-looking article. As much as 40 dollars gold are paid to skilled\r\nlabourers per 1000 for making up first-class goods. About 17,000\r\noperatives are employed in this manufacture in Havana alone. One of the\r\nlargest establishments here is that supplying the Henry Clay brands,\r\nwhich is stated to turn out from 80,000 to 120,000 cigars daily; and\r\nthere are many others of considerable importance with a well-earned and\r\nold-established reputation for fine goods.\r\n\r\n“The quality of tobacco, like other agricultural produce, depends on\r\nseasons, soil, and many natural causes, which may baffle the most\r\ncareful cultivator.\r\n\r\n“There are good and bad years; abundant and scanty crops in succession.\r\n\r\n“Except in the case of the few rich owners of plantations in the best\r\ndistricts, brands and names are no guarantees for a permanently good\r\narticle. Even these favoured few are exposed to bad seasons, if in a\r\nminor degree than less fortunate holders.\r\n\r\n“There has been no really fine-flavoured aromatic leaf harvested since\r\n1881. Much of that since garnered has been simply bad.\r\n\r\n“Great hopes are entertained of the coming 1885 crop, and present\r\nindications are in favour of this assumption.\r\n\r\n“The manner in which the wholesale trade is carried on in Havana is\r\nincomprehensible to an ordinary outsider, to whom it would appear that\r\nthe manufacturers prefer a prospective loss abroad to a present and\r\ncertain gain here. They will only execute orders, large or small, for\r\ncash over the counter, giving no, or in some cases the smallest,\r\ndiscount. No manufactured goods are kept in stock, but are made to order\r\nafter sample, and, unless examined in warehouse before delivery, and\r\nthat means little, must be paid in full on delivery, and the consequence\r\nbut too frequently is that, on arrival at their destination, they do not\r\ncorrespond with the sample, and the deluded buyer finds that he has made\r\na bad bargain, and (if an Englishman) discovers that he could have\r\nbought the same article cheaper in the English market with the\r\nadditional advantage of examining and testing the goods before purchase.\r\n\r\n“I leave the solution of this enigma to the initiated: it probably is\r\nthat the makers consign very largely, and London importers are too\r\nexperienced and too wary to pay the full invoice price until well\r\nacquainted with the wares, or they get large discounts refused to the\r\ncash purchaser in Havana.\r\n\r\n“Complaints are heard of the depressed state of the Cuban tobacco trade\r\nand of the large unsold stocks on hand. I do not think the traders\r\ndeserve sympathy, nor have they done anything to earn the confidence of\r\nforeign customers. My experience leads me to advise intending purchasers\r\nto put (I do not advise regular traders) themselves in the hands of\r\nreliable London dealers and avoid all direct purchases.\r\n\r\n“Intelligent smokers with sensitive palates will find no cheap tobacco\r\nhere fit to smoke; 50_s._ per 100 and upwards is what must be paid at\r\npresent for really fine-flavoured aromatic cigars; beyond 80_s._ or\r\n85_s._ prices become fancy ones, and are paid for the smart cases and\r\nenvelopes. Even at the rates I quote it is not easy to find what is\r\nwanted. There is abundance of dark powerful tobacco of fine quality at\r\nmuch lower rates, but not light tobacco with flavour or aroma or without\r\nstrength, such as the educated (I allude to taste) Englishman seeks. I\r\nbelieve that only about 10 per cent. of the tobacco harvested in\r\nordinary years is of the light colour I refer to, hence the difficulty\r\nin supplying the demand, and the artifices resorted to to supply the\r\ndeficiency.\r\n\r\n“Cuba’s annual tobacco crop may be estimated as between 300,000 and\r\n400,000 _tercios_ of 125 lb. each. About 30,000 persons are employed in\r\nits cultivation, and its value when harvested may be fixed (according to\r\nyear’s quality) at between 8,000,000 and 12,000,000 dol. of 4_s._\r\n\r\n“I cannot estimate the number of persons engaged in working plantation\r\n(Vegueros) and other cigars for home consumption, nor the quantity thus\r\nconsumed; but the higher class of operatives employed in cigar-making\r\nfor export number about 20,000, and turn out at present probably\r\n200,000,000 cigars annually.\r\n\r\n“The export trade has fallen off considerably of late years. In the five\r\nyears, 1870 to 1874, about 350,000,000 cigars were annually shipped to\r\nforeign ports, whereas in the period between 1879 and 1884 the annual\r\naverage export was only 200,000,000.\r\n\r\n“Probably larger quantities have been exported in each period owing to\r\nunder valuations to escape export duty; but relative bulk proportions\r\nbetween the two export periods will hardly be affected by this.”\r\n\r\nThe exports from Havana in 1884 were 11,767,200 lb. to the United\r\nStates, 613,000 to Spain, 252,600 to France, 37,500 to Mexico and South\r\nAmerica, 70,000 to Belgium, and 500 to the Mediterranean.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER V.\r\n                          PREPARATION AND USE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis chapter embraces the manufacture of cut, cake and roll tobacco,\r\ncigars, cigarettes, and snuff. It is impossible to indicate the precise\r\nform in which each kind of tobacco-leaf is manufactured for use; indeed,\r\nno well-defined line marks the qualifications of each sort, and the\r\ngreat art of the manufacturer is to combine the various growths in a\r\nmanner to produce an article suited to the tastes of his customers, at a\r\nprice suited to their pockets. But, in a general way, it may be said\r\nthat Havana and Manilla are probably exclusively consumed in the form of\r\ncigars; Virginia is a favourite for cavendish, negrohead, and black\r\ntwist, and is largely converted into returns, shag, and snuff; Kentucky,\r\nMissouri, and Ohio are used for cavendish, brown twist, bird’s-eye,\r\nreturns, and shag; Dutch and German make the commonest cigars, k’naster,\r\nmoist snuffs, and smoking-mixtures; Java and Japan are selected for\r\nlight cigars, mixtures, and light moist shag; Latakia, Turkey, Paraguay,\r\nBrazil, China, and the remainder, are used up in cigarettes, mixtures,\r\nimitations, and substitutes.\r\n\r\n_Damping._—The tobacco-leaves are received by the manufacturer in all\r\nkinds of packages, from a hogshead to a seron (raw hide), and of all\r\nweights from 1 to 12 cwt. The first process they undergo is “damping,”\r\nwhich is necessary to overcome their brittleness, and admit of their\r\nmanipulation without breaking. For this purpose, the bunches (“hands”)\r\nare separated, and the leaves are scattered loosely upon a portion of\r\nthe floor of the factory, recessed to retain the moisture. A quantity of\r\nwater, which has been accurately proportioned to the absorbing qualities\r\nof the leaf used, and to the weight present, is applied through a\r\nfine-rosed watering-pot, and the mass is left usually for about 24\r\nhours, that damped on one morning being ready for working on the\r\nfollowing morning. In England, water alone is admissible (by legislative\r\nenactment) for damping, except in special cases to be noted\r\nsubsequently; but abroad, many “sauces” are in vogue, their chief\r\ningredients being salt, sal ammoniac, and sugar.\r\n\r\n_Stripping and Sorting._—Quantities of leaf-tobacco are shipped in a\r\ncondition deprived of their stem and midrib, and are then known as\r\n“stripts.” Those which are not received in this state, after having been\r\ndamped, are passed through the hands of workmen, who fold each leaf edge\r\nto edge, and rip out the midrib by a deft twirl of the fingers,\r\nclassifying the two halves of each leaf, and ranging the sorts in\r\nseparate piles as smooth as possible. The value of the leaf greatly\r\ndepends upon the dexterity with which the stripping is done, as the\r\nslightest tear deteriorates it. Stripts require sorting only. The\r\nlargest and strongest leaves are selected for cutting and spinning; the\r\nbest-shaped are reserved for the wrappers of cigars; broken and\r\ndefective pieces form fillers for cigars; and the ribs are ground to\r\nmake snuff. For the manufacture of “bird’s-eye” smoking-tobacco, the\r\nleaves are used without being previously stripped.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 14.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 15.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 16.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 17.]\r\n\r\n_Cutting._—Cutting is the process by which the damped leaves, whether\r\nstripped or not, are most extensively prepared for smoking in pipes and\r\ncigarettes. The tobacco-cutter which is in general use in this country\r\nis shown in Figs. 14 (side elevation), 15 (sectional elevation), 16\r\n(front elevation), and 17 (plan). The main frames _a_ are united by\r\nstretcher-bolts _b_; _d_ is a wooden-surface feeding-roller, on which\r\nthe tobacco is pressed and cut; _c_ are the upper compressing- and\r\nfeeding-rollers, mounted in _e_, carriage-plates extended backwards,\r\nforming the sides of the feeding-trough, and hinged to the axle _m_; _f_\r\nare levers; _g_, links by which the weight _w_ presses down the upper\r\nrollers; _h_, a crank, and _i_, a connecting-link for working; _j_, the\r\ncross-head to which the knife _k_ is fixed; _l_, side-levers or\r\nradius-bars for guiding the knife, hinged on the eccentric ends of the\r\naxle; _m_, an axle held in bearings at the back of the machine; on its\r\nmiddle part, which is concentric with its own bearings, are hinged the\r\ntop roll carriage-plates _e_, whilst on its projecting ends, which are\r\nslightly eccentric, the knife-levers _l_ are hinged; _n_ is a worm-wheel\r\nsegment; _o_, a worm; _p_, a hand-wheel for turning the eccentric\r\nspindle _m_ through a part of a revolution in its bearings, for\r\nadjusting the contact of the knife with the nose-plate _q_; _r_, a worm;\r\n_s_, a worm-wheel; _t_, a worm-pinion for giving simultaneous movement\r\nto all the rollers; _u_, a spindle, “universal jointed” at both ends,\r\nfor driving the upper rollers in positions varying with the thickness of\r\nthe feed; _v_, a saw-toothed ratchet-wheel, moved intermittently by a\r\ncatch _x_, link _y_, and stud-pin _z_, _v_ being changeable, and the\r\neccentricity of _z_ variable, for the purpose of regulating the fineness\r\nof the cutting. Both ends of the knife move at the same speed, and its\r\nsurface is made to clear the work by describing a slight curve. The\r\nknife is adjusted accurately to the nose-plate, while the machine is in\r\nmotion, by varying the direction of eccentricity of the axis of the\r\nknife-levers to that of the roller-levers. The fineness of the cutting\r\nis regulated by varying the eccentricity of a movable stud-pin in a\r\nplate on the crank-shaft which gives motion, through a train of\r\nspeed-reducing gear, to the several rollers. The knives are easily\r\nremoved and replaced, and require sharpening after every 4–6 hours’\r\nworking. Two men attend the machine, one to keep the feed-rollers\r\nsupplied, the other to watch that the knife is doing its work, and to\r\nremove the tobacco as fast as it is cut.\r\n\r\n_Drying._—The cut tobacco, as removed from the machine, is placed\r\nloosely in a layer several inches deep in a large trough, provided with\r\na canvas false bottom; steam is introduced between the true and false\r\nbottoms, and finds its way up through the tobacco, which is thus\r\nrendered more easily workable. It is next transferred to a similar\r\ntrough having no false bottom, but a steam-jacketed floor instead; here\r\nthe tobacco is dry-heated, and at the same time lightened up by hand.\r\nFinally, it is taken to a third trough, where cold air is forced through\r\nthe canvas false bottom, by means of a blower or fan. This last\r\noperation dries the tobacco ready for use in the course of some hours;\r\nbut it has the disadvantage of dispersing part of the aroma, and is\r\ntherefore generally resorted to only when time presses. In other cases,\r\nthe drying is conducted on canvas trays. However performed, the drying\r\noperation needs the greatest attention, to prevent the moisture being\r\nextracted to such a degree as to destroy the profit which its presence\r\nconfers upon the manufacturer. With drying, the preparation of cut\r\ntobacco for smoking in pipes is completed.\r\n\r\n_Cake or Plug._—The manufacture of “cake” or “plug” is little carried on\r\nin this country, as the Excise laws exclude the use of sweetening\r\nmatters, except when carried on in bond. The process is sufficiently\r\nsimple. Virginian leaf, with or without the addition of flavourings, is\r\nsweated for a day or two, to deepen the colour, worked into a soft mass,\r\nand next placed in moulds, and subjected to sufficient pressure to\r\nensure the cohesion of the mass. Each cake is then separately wrapped in\r\nperfect leaf, and passes through a series of moulds, each smaller than\r\nthe last, and under increasing pressure in steam-jacketed\r\ncupboard-presses, of which there are many forms. The combined effect of\r\nthe heat and pressure is to thoroughly impregnate the whole mass with\r\nthe natural juices of the leaf and the flavouring (if any has been\r\nused), and to produce a rich dark colour.\r\n\r\nA machine for turning out plug-tobacco in ribbons, made by the McGowan\r\nPump Co., New York, is shown in Fig. 18. The tobacco is first weighed\r\nout in the proper quantities, and spread in a box placed in spaces in a\r\nheavy iron table a. When the latter is filled, it is passed to and fro\r\nunder the heavy iron wheels b, which are loose on the shaft, and which\r\ncan be adjusted to exert any desired pressure. Twice passing through\r\nsuffices. The ribbon is made in lengths of 10 feet, and either 5¾ inches\r\nor 2⅞ inches wide, as desired.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 18.]\r\n\r\n_Roll or Twist._—Roll- or twist-tobacco is made by spinning the leaf\r\ninto a rope, and then subjecting it to hot pressure. Until recently, the\r\nspinning was performed by hand, much after the manner of ordinary\r\nrope-making by hand. But this slow process is now superseded by a\r\nmachine made by Robinson and Andrew, of Stockport; it is spoken of in\r\nvery favourable terms by English manufacturers, and received a diploma\r\nof merit at the Philadelphia Exhibition. The machine consists of a\r\ncombination of 3 rollers, whose surfaces are made of segments, to which\r\nlateral to-and-fro motions are given by cams attached to the stands on\r\nwhich the axles of the rollers rotate. The tobacco occupies the central\r\nspace between the 3 rollers, and it is carried through the machine by\r\nthe lateral to-and-fro motions given to the segments. The fillers and\r\nwrappers are laid on a table joined to the machine. The filler is placed\r\nin the cover, and they pass together between the rollers, whose action\r\ntwists and compresses the tobacco into a roll; this is carried forward\r\nand wound on a bobbin, revolving in an open frame, and provided with a\r\nguide for equalizing the distribution of the tobacco.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 19.\r\n               FIG. 20.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 21.]\r\n\r\nThe machine is shown in Figs. 19 (elevation), 20 (plan), and 21 (end\r\nview). The tobacco is laid on the table _a_, provided with a rib _n_, on\r\nwhich the sliding rest _b_ is free to move to and fro; _c d_ are the two\r\nlower segmental rollers, the axles of which revolve in stationary\r\nbearings; _e_ is the top roller, the axle of which revolves in sliding\r\nbearings, fitting in the swing-frame _f_, and each acted upon by a\r\nspring _o_, pressing on a pin communicating with the bearing, and\r\nputting an elastic pressure on the tobacco.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 22.\r\n               FIG. 23.]\r\n\r\nEach segment-roller consists of an axle with four segments, best shown\r\nin Figs. 22 and 23. The outer shell of the segments is made of hard\r\nwood, fitting an inner shell of malleable cast-iron, the projections on\r\nwhich suit grooves on the cast-iron axle. The segments of the rollers _c\r\nd_ are moved laterally to and fro by the wedge-shaped cams _p q r s_,\r\nfixed to the bearings of the roller-axles; and the segments of the\r\nroller _e_ are moved in the same manner by cams _t u_, fixed to the\r\nswing-frame _f_. The tobacco occupies the central space between the 3\r\nrollers, and the cams _p r t_ move the segments in the direction of the\r\narrow where they touch the tobacco, while the cams _q s u_ move them\r\nback. After the tobacco has passed beyond the segment-rollers, it goes\r\nthrough the hollow trunnion of the open frame _g_, in which the bobbin\r\n_h_ revolves; the other trunnion of the frame _g_ is provided with fast\r\nand loose pulleys, by which the whole machine is driven. To this\r\ntrunnion, are also fixed an ordinary friction-break pulley, and a\r\ngrooved pulley, around which latter passes a band for driving the pulley\r\non the axle of the bobbin _h_. To the other end of the axle of the\r\nbobbin, is fixed a pinion, which, by means of a toothed chain, gives\r\nmotion to another pinion fixed to the double screw _i_; this double\r\nscrew gives a traversing to-and-fro motion to the guide _j_, for\r\ndistributing the tobacco evenly on the bobbin, by means of a swivel\r\n=Ｔ=-headed stud, connected with the guide, and taking into the thread of\r\nthe double screw. The guide is provided with two horizontal grooved\r\nrollers, between which the tobacco passes, and with two other rollers to\r\nguide the tobacco on to the bobbin.\r\n\r\nRotary motion is communicated to the segment-rollers _c d e_ as\r\nfollows:—To the hollow trunnion of the open frame _g_, is affixed a\r\npinion, which drives the wheel _k_, on the same shaft as the\r\nchange-pinion that drives the wheel gearing into the pinions on the\r\naxles of the rollers _c_ and _d_, and one of which pinions gears into\r\nthe intermediate pinion _l_, which drives the pinions on the axle of the\r\nroller _e_. The driving-strap is held upon the fast pulley by a\r\ndrop-catch acting on a weighted lever, one arm of which is connected by\r\na link to the lower end of a strap fork-lever. When it is requisite to\r\nstop the machine, the attendant kicks the point of a catch off the end\r\nof the lever, which is then raised by the weight, and so moves the\r\ndriving-strap from the fast to the loose pulley, the stoppage being\r\nvirtually instantaneous. The mode of working is as follows:—The spinner\r\nand assistants stand at opposite sides of the table; the fillers and\r\nwrappers being placed on the table, one assistant spreads out the\r\nwrapper and pushes the end towards the filler, which the spinner\r\nsupplies and holds against the sliding-rest _b_; the rotary motion of\r\nthe segment-rollers _c d e_ twists the tobacco, and causes the wrapper\r\nto be wound over the filler, and the rest _b_, being movable, enables\r\nthe spinner to regulate its position according to the quantity and\r\nquality of the filler and wrapper. The lateral motion of the\r\nsegment-rollers passes the roll towards the bobbin, on which it is\r\nwound, as described. The combined rotary and traversing motions of the\r\nrollers consolidate the tobacco, and put the desired face upon the\r\ntwist. The roller _e_ is supported in a swing-frame, which is lifted off\r\nthe tobacco when starting the machine. When the machine is at work, the\r\nswing-frame is held down by the stud _m_ (Fig. 19). The figures\r\nrepresent a machine suitable for manufacturing Limerick roll; for\r\npigtail and other small descriptions, it is necessary to reduce the\r\ndiameter of one or more of the segment-rollers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 24.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 25.]\r\n\r\nA more recent improvement in this machine, by J. E. A. Andrew, is shown\r\nin Figs. 24 (side view), 25 (transverse section), and 26 (plan). The\r\ntable _a_, rib _n_, and sliding-rest _b_, and two lower segment-rollers\r\n_c d_, are constructed as usual; but the axles of the segment-rollers\r\nrevolve in bearings _g h_, bolted to the flanges of swivel-frames _i k_,\r\nhinged upon the fulcrum-shaft _x_; the object of thus supporting the\r\nbottom rollers _c d_ is to be able to vary the distance between them\r\naccording to the thickness of the twist of tobacco that is being rolled.\r\nWhen the distance between the rollers is fixed, the bearings are secured\r\nby bolts passing through segmental slots. The solid top roller _e_\r\nrevolves in centres in sliding bearings fitting in the swing-frame _f_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 26.]\r\n\r\nAs the bobbin is filled, it is removed, and replaced by an empty one.\r\nThe rope is then unwound, and formed into rolls, by the aid of a spindle\r\nwith flanges at the sides, worked by a treadle, under a cushioned weight\r\nwhich squeezes the coils closely together as they are wound. The\r\ncompleted rolls are subjected to great pressure in steam-jacketed\r\npresses, in the same way, and with the same object, as the cakes or\r\nplugs.\r\n\r\n_Cigars._—Cigars are composed of two parts, a core formed of pieces of\r\nleaf placed longitudinally, known as “fillers,” and a covering formed of\r\nperfect leaf, called the “wrapper.” Probably all the best cigars are\r\nmade by hand, the only tools required being a short-bladed sharp knife,\r\na receptacle containing an emulsion of gum, and a square wooden disc or\r\n“cutting-board.” A portion of perfect leaf is first shaped to form the\r\nwrapper of the cigar; then a bunch of fillers is moulded in the hand,\r\nand rolled up tightly in the wrapper, the taper end being secured by\r\ngumming. Expert workmen make the cigars remarkably uniform in weight and\r\nshape. When made, they are sorted according to colour, deftly trimmed at\r\nthe thick end, and placed in their boxes in cupboards heated by\r\ngas-stoves to finally dry or season before being stored for sale.\r\n\r\nIn America, machinery is introduced wherever possible. Moulds for\r\nshaping the cigars are made of hard wood, sometimes partially lined with\r\ntin, and of every possible size and form. A machine is made by Dubrul\r\nand Co., of Cincinnati, for working 3 sets of moulds at once, 2 being\r\nkept filled up under pressure while the 3rd is being filled, or the\r\nbunches are being rolled up. A handy little machine for rolling the\r\nfillers for cigars is that known as Henneman’s, made by Dubrul and Co.\r\nThe demand for scrap-made cigars, or those manufactured with short\r\nfillers, has caused the introduction of machines for cutting and sifting\r\nscrap. One made by Dubrul and Co. is shown in Fig. 27. It consists\r\nessentially of a cylinder formed of hook-shaped, double-edged steel\r\nblades, revolving against 3 series of fixed but adjustable steel blades,\r\nthus permitting the size to be regulated at will.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 27.]\r\n\r\n_Cigarettes._—Cigarettes consist of paper tubes filled with cut tobacco,\r\nwith or without an external wrapper of leaf tobacco. Preference is\r\nusually given to those made by hand, but machines have been introduced\r\nwith some success for making the commoner kinds. A French machine for\r\nmaking cigarettes is shown in Fig. 28. Its work consists in making the\r\npaper tubes, and filling them with tobacco. The paper, previously\r\nprepared, in a band about 3 inches wide, is unrolled from the coil _a_\r\nby means of the carriage _b_, and cut off in pieces about 1 inch long\r\nfor presentation to the mandrel _c_, temporarily introduced into one of\r\nthe tubes of the mould-carrier _d_. The mandrel has a clamp which grasps\r\nthe paper and rolls it, and, at the moment when the latter escapes from\r\nthe carriage, its free end is brought upon a rubber pad covered with\r\ngum, hidden in the illustration. The paper tube is left in the mould,\r\nthe mandrel being extracted by means of the cam _e_; the mould-carrier\r\nis then turned ⅟<sub>9</sub> revolution by the cam _f_, a new tube comes\r\ninto line, and the operation is repeated. When 6 paper tubes are\r\ncompleted, the first one is pushed by a small piston, actuated by the\r\ncam _g_, upon the end of the filling-tube; and immediately the rod _h_,\r\nactuated by the cam _e_, drives into this tube a portion of tobacco\r\nalready prepared in the compressor _i_. In preparing the tobacco, a\r\nworkman, occupying the seat _m_, is necessary to dispose the material in\r\nregular layers on a carrier, by which it is transported into the\r\ncompressor. When the cigarette-envelope is filled, the mould-carrier\r\nagain makes part of a revolution, and the finished cigarette is pushed\r\nout of the mould by the rod _k_, also actuated by the cam _e_; a device\r\nfinally lodges the cigarettes in the box _l_. One workman is said to be\r\nable to turn out 9600 cigarettes in 10 hours by the aid of the machine.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 28.]\r\n\r\n_Snuff._—Snuff is entitled to the last place in the series of tobacco\r\nmanufactures, as it is largely made up of the scraps, cuttings, and\r\nrejections of the preceding processes. The materials are chopped very\r\nfine, placed in heaps in warm damp cellars, “doctored” with various\r\nflavourings, left to ferment for several weeks, and then ground to\r\npowder in edge-runner mills, some kinds even undergoing a slight\r\nroasting. When ground, the mass is passed through “mulls,” wood-lined,\r\nbottomless bowls, let into a bench, where the snuff is softened and\r\nrendered less powdery by means of pointed pins, resembling domestic\r\nrolling-pins, which slowly travel around the sides of the bowls. Snuff\r\nrepresents a highly profitable article manufactured from materials that\r\nare otherwise useless, and depending for its flavour chiefly upon the\r\nperfumes and flavourings used. Hence these last are kept profoundly\r\nsecret by the manufacturer.\r\n\r\nFrom refuse tobacco which is unfit for any other purpose, is made a\r\ndecoction for washing sheep and destroying vermin; often the waste is\r\nground very fine, and used by gardeners, presumably to keep noxious\r\ninsects away.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 29.]\r\n\r\n_Miscellaneous Appliances._—The customary ingenuity of the Americans has\r\ninvented a profusion of admirable labour-saving machines for almost all\r\nthe operations of the tobacco manufacturer. A few of these only can be\r\nnoticed in the present article.\r\n\r\nFig. 29 shows a portable resweating-apparatus, intended for darkening\r\nthe colour of tobacco to suit the dealer’s market. It measures 4 feet\r\nlong, 3 feet wide, and 5 feet high, being just large enough for one case\r\n(400 lb.) of tobacco, including the case; it consists of a water-tank\r\n_a_, a pipe _b_ for conducting the water into the metallic pan _c_, at\r\nthe bottom of the apparatus, which is heated by gas-jets _d_. The\r\ntobacco is introduced by the door _e_, which is fitted with a\r\nthermometer. The roof is sloped so as to determine the flow of the water\r\nof condensation. The steaming occupies 3–5 days, and needs occasional\r\nwatching. The apparatus is made by C. S. Philips and Co., 188 Pearl\r\nStreet, New York.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 30.]\r\n\r\nFig. 30 illustrates a complicated machine, introduced by C. C. Clawson\r\nand Co., of Raleigh, N. Carolina, for putting up large quantities of\r\ntobacco in parcels of 2 oz. upwards. It consists of a central table\r\nprovided with automatic scales for weighing out the portion; four\r\nequidistant guides which determine the form of the package; a plunger\r\nfor packing, and a follower for raising the package; a side-table\r\ncarrying tongs for holding the empty bags; and another to receive the\r\npackages, and hold them during tying. The hopper being supplied with\r\ntobacco, and the machine put in motion, each form takes a bag from the\r\ntong-table, and the article having been weighed, is carried to the form\r\nby a shute, when it drops into the bag, is packed by the plunger, and\r\ntransferred to the tying-table. With 2 girls or boys, it is said to\r\nweigh, pack, and tie 30 bags a minute.\r\n\r\nThe New York Tobacco Machine Co. make two forms of machines for\r\ngranulating tobacco, chiefly for making “Killickinick” and cigarettes,\r\ntheir working capacity ranging from 200 to 2000 lb. a day. The\r\ncutting-rollers are covered with cross-millings at right angles to each\r\nother, those running lengthwise being deep; the fixed cutters are\r\nadjustable, so that the cutting may be either coarse or fine. When\r\nworking, the action is like that of a pair of shears, except that the\r\ncross-millings reduce the strips to a granular state. Both stems and\r\nleaves may be worked up. The great advantage claimed for these machines\r\nis that, though the tobacco should be dry, the percentage of dust\r\nescaping is reduced to a nominal figure.\r\n\r\nA cutting-machine made by the same Co. is shown in Fig. 31. It is\r\nadapted to cut leaf, stem, scrap, plug, or any form of tobacco, to any\r\nrequired degree of fineness, turning out 300–400 lb. a day. The action\r\nis almost precisely that of a chaff-cutter. The Co.’s sifting-machine\r\nconsists of an adjustable cylindrical wire sieve, with a rattan-broom\r\nscrew-roller revolving inside. The stems are stripped and worked out at\r\none end, while the remainder is broken up, and passed through the sieve,\r\nfalling upon a perforated tray, through which pass the finest particles\r\nfor snuff-making. A machine largely used in America is the stem-roller,\r\nfor crushing and flattening the stems so that they may be used like\r\nleaves for making cigars. Great benefit is anticipated in the United\r\nStates from the adaptation of Ryerson’s “attrition mill” to\r\nsnuff-grinding, owing to the fact that the pulverization is accomplished\r\nwithout the particles being heated in the least degree. Of\r\ncigarette-making machines, there are many kinds; the best are those\r\nwhich deal with the tobacco in a comparatively dry state, thus\r\npreventing shrinkage after packing.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 31.]\r\n\r\nIndebtedness is acknowledged to Hy. Archer and Co., Borough, S.E., and\r\nT. Brankston and Co., Carter Lane, Doctors’ Commons, for opportunities\r\nof inspecting their thoroughly representative works, and for much\r\ninformation readily given concerning the manufacture in this country; to\r\nW. Jollyman, of W. D. and H. O. Wills’ London house, for having revised\r\nthese sheets before going to press; and to Hy. A. Forrest, 61 Broadway,\r\nagent of the New York Tobacco Machine Co., for valuable material\r\nrelating to American machines and processes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER VI.\r\n                         NATURE AND PROPERTIES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe active principle of tobacco is a volatile, highly poisonous\r\nalkaloid, called Nicotine (C₁₀H₁₄N₂). Although green tobacco-plants\r\ncontain generally more nicotine than the leaves after they have been\r\nprepared for the market, yet the odour is only perceptible after the\r\nfermentation of the leaves has set in. It has been ascertained that\r\nyoung leaves 2 inches long contained 2·8 per cent., and leaves 10½\r\ninches broad and 16 inches long, as much as 5·6 per cent. of their\r\nweight of nicotine. The amount increases as the plants become ripe, and\r\ndecreases on their becoming overripe.\r\n\r\nThough the narcotic effects of tobacco experienced by the smoker must\r\npartly be attributed to nicotine, it cannot be said that they are solely\r\ndue to it. It is well known that the products of combustion of quite\r\nharmless substances are often stupefying. Good Syrian tobacco contains\r\nno nicotine, yet smokers consider cigars made from this tobacco to be\r\nstrong. It is evident that the strength of a cigar, as judged by the\r\nsmoker, depends greatly on the circumstance whether the tobacco burns\r\nwell or not. If it burns well, a greater amount of nicotine is consumed\r\nand decomposed, and less of the narcotic products of combustion are\r\ncreated, than when it burns badly. Cigars of the latter description,\r\ncontaining little nicotine, are more narcotic in their effects when\r\nsmoked than well-burning cigars containing much nicotine.\r\n\r\nThe amount of nicotine in tobacco varies very much, according to the\r\nsort of plant, the climate, the nature of the soil in which the plant\r\ngrew, the treatment received during its growth, and the course adopted\r\nto prepare the leaf for the market. Dr. Nessler found that good Syrian\r\ntobacco contained no nicotine, Havana tobaccos between 0·6 and 2·0 per\r\ncent., and German tobaccos between 0·7 and 3·3 per cent. Schlösing found\r\nin French tobacco nearly 8·0 per cent. of nicotine. Fine tobaccos\r\ncontain generally little or no nicotine. Broughton found that the amount\r\nof nicotine in Indian tobaccos varies very much. The conditions\r\nfavourable to the development of nicotine in the plants are:—Soil in a\r\nbad physical state, strong nitrogenous manure, a dry atmosphere, and\r\nprobably a low temperature during the growth.\r\n\r\nAccording to Nessler, green and newly-cut tobacco-plants contain no\r\nammonia; it is developed during the drying and fermentation of the\r\nleaves, especially when they assume a brown colour. Tobacco-leaves,\r\nwhich have undergone a strong fermentation, contain more ammonia than\r\nthose slightly fermented. Fine tobaccos contain generally less ammonia\r\nthan coarser ones. In various smoking-tobaccos, Nessler found:—Havana,\r\n0·2 per cent. of ammonia; Cuba, 0·3; Syrian, 0·6; German, 0·9 per cent.\r\nSchlösing found Havana tobacco to contain 0·8 per cent.\r\n\r\nNitric acid, consisting of nitrogen and oxygen, is formed in animal and\r\nplant substances when decomposed under the influence of atmospheric air\r\nand a sufficiently high temperature; whereas ammonia, consisting of\r\nnitrogen and hydrogen, is formed when those substances decompose in the\r\nabsence, or nearly so, of atmospheric air. Organic substances\r\ndecomposing under the latter condition emit an objectionable pungent\r\nodour, which must partly be attributed to the formation of ammonia.\r\nTobacco, soon after harvesting, commences, according to the conditions\r\nunder which it is placed, one of these decompositions. The extent of the\r\ndecomposition the tobacco has gone through may be partly judged from the\r\ncolour the leaves have attained. If leaves be dried so rapidly as to\r\nremain green, the decomposition is probably confined to the formation of\r\ncarbonic acid. A yellow colour indicates the formation of nitric acid;\r\nand a dark-brown or black colour, that of ammonia. The conditions under\r\nwhich nitric acid and ammonia are formed being known, it is possible to\r\ncontrol their development. When the tobacco is hung far apart, so that\r\nthe air has free access, the formation of nitric acid will take place;\r\nbut if the air be excluded more or less, by hanging the tobacco very\r\nclose, or pressing it in heaps or pits, the formation of ammonia is\r\nengendered.\r\n\r\nNitric acid generally promotes the combustion of plant substances, by\r\nsupplying a portion of the needed oxygen, and has undoubtedly a similar\r\neffect in tobacco; its occurrence in the tobacco is therefore a\r\ndesideratum with the cultivator and manufacturer, and to supply any\r\ndeficiency, the manufacturer often resorts to impregnating his tobacco\r\nwith a solution of saltpetre. From this, however, it must not be\r\nconcluded that every tobacco containing a large amount of nitric acid\r\nwill necessarily burn well. Schlösing and Nessler have shown that the\r\nwell-burning of a tobacco does not always correspond with a great amount\r\nof nitric acid, thus indicating that other substances or other\r\nconditions also affect the combustibility. The effect of the nitric acid\r\nwill most probably vary with the base with which it is in combination.\r\n\r\nThe nitrogen in the forms of nicotine, ammonia, and nitric acid,\r\nconstitutes only a small portion of the total amount present in tobacco;\r\nby far the greater portion (⅔–⅞) exists in the form of albuminoids.\r\nNessler found that the nitrogen under this form varies from 2 to 4 per\r\ncent., which is equal to 13–26 per cent. of albuminoids. Substances rich\r\nin albuminoids generally burn badly, and emit a pungent noxious odour.\r\nOn the condition of these albuminoids, and on the presence of other\r\nsubstances, as nitric acid, alkalies, &c., in the tobacco, mostly depend\r\nthe burning qualities of the leaf, and the flavour of a cigar. The\r\nEastern habit in smoking, from Malaysia, Japan and China, through India,\r\nPersia and Turkey, even to Hungary, is to inhale the smoke into the\r\nlungs, and natives of these countries maintain that a tobacco should be\r\nof full flavour without burning the throat or catching the breath.\r\nWestern nations do not admit the smoke further than the mouth, and\r\ntherefore require a strong, rank flavour.\r\n\r\nWhilst drying and fermenting, the tobacco undergoes great changes. Some\r\nsubstances are decomposed, others are newly formed. The highly\r\ncomplicated compounds, the albuminoids, undergo first decomposition, and\r\nin doing so give rise to more simple combinations. Nitric acid, ammonia,\r\nand other substances less known are chiefly, if not entirely, derived\r\nfrom the products of the decomposition of albuminoids. The substances\r\nthat cause the objectionable pungent smell in tobacco are formed from\r\nthe broken-up constituents of these high combinations. The conditions\r\nunder which these bad-smelling combinations originate are not properly\r\nknown; but it is probable that they are developed with, and under the\r\nsame conditions that cause the formation of, ammonia, as the\r\ndisagreeable pungent flavour is found generally in tobacco that has\r\nundergone fermentation to a great extent. It is believed that the\r\nconditions that favour the development of nicotine are also conducive to\r\nthe formation of albuminous substances in the leaf, viz. fresh\r\nnitrogenous manure, bad physical state of the soil, &c.\r\n\r\nAccording to Nessler, the quality of tobacco depends to a great degree\r\non the amount of cellulose it contains. He found that a good tobacco\r\ninvariably contained more than a bad one, Havana yielding as much as 46\r\nper cent. The fact that tobacco burns better after being stored for a\r\ntime may be partly due to an increase of cellulose in it.\r\n\r\nEvery tobacco contains more or less fat, gum, ethereal oil, &c. It is\r\nnot properly known in what way fatty matters affect the quality of\r\ntobacco. Many other organic matters exist in tobacco in combination with\r\nsubstances from which it is most difficult to separate them; they have\r\nnot as yet been quantitatively ascertained, and are therefore little\r\nknown. Most of them are only developed during the drying and fermenting\r\nof the leaf; their presence, however, considerably affects the quality\r\nof the tobacco.\r\n\r\nThe amount of ash constituents in the tobacco is considerable, varying\r\nbetween 16 and 28 per cent. There cannot be said to exist a definite\r\nrelation between the total amount of ash in the tobacco and its quality,\r\nas tobaccos yielding much ash are sometimes of good, and at other times\r\nof bad, quality; a good tobacco may yield much or little ash. The\r\nrelative proportion in which the ash constituents exist is, however, of\r\nthe greatest importance. It has been ascertained that the presence of\r\nsome special mineral elements modify to a great extent the quality of\r\nthe tobacco. Of all ash constituents, potash (K₂O), more correctly\r\nspeaking potassium carbonate (K₂CO₃), affects the quality of tobacco in\r\nthe highest degree. Schlösing has pointed out that the good burning\r\nqualities of a tobacco depend on the presence in it of potash in\r\ncombination with a vegetable acid; that a soil deficient in potash is\r\nunfit to produce tobacco of good quality. Numerous analyses have tended\r\nnot only to corroborate the assertion made by Schlösing, but to\r\ndemonstrate also, that it is not the total amount of potash, but the\r\npotash found as a carbonate, which existed in the plant in combination\r\nwith a vegetable acid, that is the constituent chiefly affecting the\r\ncombustibility of a tobacco. The complete analyses of Nessler have shown\r\nthat, although a tobacco may contain a great amount of potash, it does\r\nnot necessarily follow that the tobacco burns well. He found that some\r\nGerman tobaccos contained more potash than Havana, although the latter\r\nburned much better than the former; and that a great amount of potash\r\ndid not always indicate a great amount of carbonate of potash. Although\r\ntobaccos yielding a great amount of carbonate of potash in their ash\r\ngenerally burn well, there may be conditions which neutralize the good\r\neffect of this combination, as a large proportion of albuminoids. It may\r\ntherefore be said that the combustibility of a tobacco is improved in\r\nproportion as its ash yields more carbonate of potash, other conditions\r\nbeing equal.\r\n\r\nAmong the minor salts, the chlorides deserve most attention. It has been\r\nfound that they generally retard the burning of tobacco, and, that as\r\nthey increase, carbonate of potash decreases. Lime is invariably found\r\nmore or less in the ash, but it has not been ascertained to what extent\r\nits presence affects the quality of the tobacco; good tobacco may\r\ncontain much or little, so that its presence is probably not of great\r\nimportance. The same may be said of soda, magnesia, and phosphoric acid.\r\nAccording to Nessler, their proportions may vary thus:—Potash, 1·95–5\r\nper cent.; lime, 6·5–9·2; soda, 0–1·63; magnesia, 0·12–0·99; phosphoric\r\nacid, 0·57–1·39.\r\n\r\nIn connection with the chemistry of tobacco, and the rational manuring\r\nof the crop, the name of Prof. S. W. Johnson, Chemist to the Connecticut\r\nState Board of Agriculture, must be placed in the foremost rank.\r\nIndebtedness is acknowledged to Prof. Johnson for a copy of his valuable\r\nreport, quoted in the Bibliography at the end of this work.\r\n\r\nIn November, 1884, a paper was read by Dr. John Clark, on the\r\ncomposition of tobacco, before the Society of Chemical Industry, which\r\nis sufficiently interesting to be quoted at length.\r\n\r\nDr. Clark remarks that the “tobacco plant is very extensively cultivated\r\nin various parts of the world, and after it has reached its maturity it\r\nis cut and dried on poles. When the plant is in proper condition, the\r\nleaves are stripped from the stalk, sorted and cured, by which means\r\nthey are converted into the tobacco of commerce. The good leaves are\r\ncalled ‘wrappers,’ and the infirm or defective ones, which are separated\r\nfrom the others, are called ‘mediums and fillers.’ The term ‘strips’ is\r\napplied to tobacco leaves, from which 20 to 25 per cent. of the stem or\r\nmidrib has been removed to suit the requirements of manufacturers in\r\nthis country more especially. Tobacco is largely imported into the\r\nUnited Kingdom, partly in the manufactured state, but principally in the\r\nunmanufactured or leaf form.\r\n\r\n“Through the kindness of a well-known firm of tobacco manufacturers, I\r\nhave been furnished with authentic samples of the principal varieties of\r\nleaf tobacco, imported into this country, and the accompanying table\r\ngives the proportions of mineral matter or ash, alkaline salts, and\r\nsand, which these contain. For the sake of comparison the results are\r\nall stated in the dry tobacco, and in order to ensure greater accuracy,\r\nthe analysis was, in each case, made with several leaves, which were\r\nseparated into laminæ and stem, and the whole of each incinerated. The\r\ndifference in the composition of the laminæ and the stem is very marked,\r\nespecially as regards alkaline salts, and is of importance more\r\nespecially to the snuff manufacturer.\r\n\r\n              COMPOSITION OF VARIOUS KINDS OF LEAF TOBACCO.\r\n ──────────────────┬─────────────────┬─────────────────┬─────────────────\r\n                   │   Whole Leaf.   │     Laminæ.     │      Stem.\r\n                   │Dried at 212° F.,│Dried at 212° F.,│Dried at 212° F.,\r\n                   │    per cent.    │    per cent.    │    per cent.\r\n ──────────────────┼─────┬─────┬─────┼─────┬─────┬─────┼─────┬─────┬─────\r\n                   │ Ash.│ Alk.│Sand.│ Ash.│ Alk.│Sand.│ Ash.│ Alk.│Sand.\r\n                   │     │Salt.│     │     │Salt.│     │     │Salt.│\r\n ──────────────────┼─────┼─────┼─────┼─────┼─────┼─────┼─────┼─────┼─────\r\n U.

Roll tobacco is the staple manufacture\r\nin Scotland and Ireland, and cut tobacco the staple article in England.\r\n\r\n“In the manufacture of roll tobacco, the leaves are moistened with\r\nwater, spun into various sizes of twist, made up into rolls, and\r\npressed. The liquid or juice which exudes under pressure is used as a\r\nsheep dip. Cut tobacco is made by moistening the leaves, cutting them\r\ninto the desired size, and drying on plates. Sometimes it is made into\r\ncakes in the first instance, and afterwards cut.\r\n\r\n“When we compare the composition of roll and cut tobaccos with that of\r\nthe leaf from which they are made, we find that the difference lies\r\nalmost entirely in the amount of moisture, and as manufacturers are not\r\nallowed to add anything but water and a little oil to tobacco, you will\r\nnot err very much in assuming that as a rule the cheapest qualities of\r\nroll and cut tobaccos contain most water. Thus in 15 samples of the\r\ncheapest roll tobacco I found an average of 41·66 per cent. of water.\r\n\r\n“The lowest qualities of cut tobacco, such as are largely manufactured\r\nand consumed in England, contain as much water as the cheapest roll\r\ntobacco, whereas the finer qualities of cut tobacco contain as a rule\r\nfrom 14 to 22 per cent. Cigars, even the cheapest, are comparatively\r\ndry, and contain, as a rule, only from 10 to 12 per cent. of water.\r\n\r\n“The difference in cheap cigars is due chiefly to the weight of the\r\nmaterial, but also to the quality of the tobacco and the labour,\r\nmachinery being used in the manufacture of the lower qualities, whereas\r\nthe higher qualities are nearly all hand made.\r\n\r\n“The large quantity of water contained in the cheapest tobacco, and\r\nwhich frequently amounts to about 50 per cent., is not, in my opinion,\r\nintroduced to please the palate of the working man, but simply on\r\naccount of the keen competition between rival manufacturers, and the low\r\nprice at which tobacco is sold; and in the interest both of the working\r\nclasses and of tobacco manufacturers themselves, I think it is very\r\ndesirable that some limit should be placed to the amount of water which\r\nmay be sold as tobacco.\r\n\r\n“Snuff.—I stated that the refuse tobacco was employed in the manufacture\r\nof snuff. This refuse consists of stems, tobacco smalls, and sweepings.\r\nThese are moistened with water, subjected to a process of fermentation,\r\nwhich lasts from about six weeks to two months, then ground, mixed with\r\nalkaline salts to preserve the snuff, and flavoured when desired.\r\nNothing is allowed to be added to snuff except the carbonates,\r\nchlorides, and sulphates of potash and soda, and carbonate of ammonia.\r\nIt is also provided by Act of Parliament that any snuff found to\r\ncontain, after being dried at 212° F., more than 26 per cent. of such\r\nsalts, including those naturally in the tobacco, will be liable to\r\nforfeiture and a penalty of 50_l._ From my table of analyses you will\r\nobserve that not only does the proportion of alkaline salts vary in\r\ndifferent tobaccos, but the stem contains a much larger proportion than\r\nthe leaf. On this account it is necessary that the snuff manufacturer\r\nshould know the quantity of alkaline salts in his snuff material, in\r\norder to obtain an article of uniform composition. Some manufacturers go\r\nby rule of thumb, and in attempting to work close to the legal limit,\r\nthey run a serious risk of unintentionally incurring the penalty. As a\r\nmatter of fact, three samples of snuff, in 1883, were condemned by the\r\nSomerset House authorities because they contained an excessive\r\nproportion of alkaline salts, and the manufacturers were prosecuted. The\r\nmore intelligent of the snuff manufacturers, however, analyse their\r\nsnuff material, and are thus able to keep within the legal limit.\r\n\r\n“The principal alkaline salts which are added to snuff are chloride of\r\nsodium or common salt, carbonate of potash, and carbonate of ammonia,\r\nall of which are allowed by Act of Parliament, and therefore no\r\nexception can be taken to their addition, so long as the total quantity\r\ndoes not exceed 26 per cent. in the dry snuff. In addition to alkaline\r\nsalts, snuffs usually contain from 25 to 45 per cent. of water, with the\r\nexception of a kind of snuff called ‘High Toast or Irish Blackguard,’\r\nwhich is very dry and contains from 5 to 8 per cent. Sometimes they also\r\ncontain a considerable quantity of sand. In the several hundred samples\r\nof snuff which I have had occasion to examine for different\r\nmanufacturers the average quantity of sand was about 5 per cent. in the\r\ndry snuff, and sometimes fell as low as a half per cent., but in many\r\nsamples the quantity exceeded 10 per cent., and in one case I found as\r\nmuch as 30·94 per cent. of sand in the dry snuff. The greater part of\r\nthis sand is probably derived from the sweepings of tobacco, on which\r\nduty has been paid, and I have no doubt the snuff manufacturer considers\r\nhimself justified in selling it as snuff. But it appears to me to be\r\nvery desirable in the interest of snuffers, that some limit should be\r\nplaced on the quantity of sand which may be sold as snuff: more\r\nespecially as the particles of sand are frequently very sharp, and have\r\na tendency to produce inflammation of the mucous membrane of the nose,\r\nand it is to this, probably, that we owe the popular notion that snuff\r\nis sometimes mixed with ground glass to give it additional piquancy.\r\n\r\n“When from any cause snuff is spoiled, the manufacturer may export it,\r\nand obtain a drawback of 3_s._ 7_d._ per lb. on the real tobacco which\r\nit contains.\r\n\r\n“The Government standard for tobacco is as follows:\r\n\r\n                                         Per cent.\r\n                     Organic matter          70·52\r\n                     Inorganic               15·48\r\n                     Water                   14·00\r\n                                            ——————\r\n                                            100·00\r\n\r\n“This is equal to 18 per cent. of ash or inorganic matter in the dry\r\ntobacco. This standard is in my opinion too high, as the average\r\npercentage of inorganic or ash in the dry leaf tobaccos which I have\r\nexamined is 20·32, and the stem from which snuff is largely made\r\ncontains still more. The result is that the tobacco manufacturer not\r\nonly loses the value of the tobacco over and above the duty, but also a\r\npart of the duty which he has paid. This matter concerns the tobacco\r\nmanufacturer alone, but I would point out that the authorities in\r\nSomerset House in fixing such a high standard for tobacco are benefiting\r\nthe public at the expense of the manufacturer, whereas in the case of\r\nmilk the low standard which they employ is a loss to the public and gain\r\nto the dishonest dealer.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER VII.\r\n                     ADULTERATIONS AND SUBSTITUTES.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is said that in Thuringia, over 1000 tons yearly of dried\r\nbeetroot-leaves are passed off as tobacco. These leaves, and those of\r\nchicory and cabbage, are similarly employed in Magdeburg and the\r\nPalatinate. Many of the _Vevey_ cigars of S. Germany are entirely\r\ncomposed of cabbage- and beetroot-leaves which have been steeped in\r\ntobacco-water for a long time. Other leaves, such as rhubarb, dock,\r\nburdock, and coltsfoot are also used. These are all principally for\r\ncigars. For smoking-tobacco, chamomile flowers, exhausted in water, then\r\ndyed and sweetened with logwood and liquorice, and dried, have been\r\nmixed with tobacco in such proportions as 70–80 per cent. In America, a\r\nspecially-prepared brown paper, saturated with the juice expressed from\r\ntobacco-stems and other refuse, is most extensively used, not only for\r\nthe “wrappers” of cigars, but also for “filling.” Various ground woods,\r\nstarches, meals, and pigments are introduced into snuff.\r\n\r\nA New York paper mentions that a great quantity of brown straw paper\r\nlately reached Havana, which was to be employed in the manufacture of\r\nHavana cigars. Straw paper impregnated with the juice of tobacco stalks\r\nis wound up with the leaf in such a way that it is often impossible to\r\ndetect the adulteration. Dr. Jacobson, writing in the _Industrie\r\nBlätter_, remarks that there is no difficulty in escaping detection, if\r\nthe paper be specially prepared for the purpose out of suitable raw\r\nmaterials. It has long been known that cigar paper soaked in a solution\r\nof soluble glass gives forth no smell of paper on being burnt.\r\n\r\nPatent No. 210,538, issued from the United States Patent Office,\r\nDecember 3, 1878, states the ingredients of a “substitute” to\r\nbe—spikenard, red clover, hyssop, hops, slippery-elm bark, tarred rope,\r\npennyroyal, mullein leaves, kinnikinic, wild cherry bark, and ginseng.\r\nThis is an ingenious combination intended to approach in effect,\r\nappearance, and aroma, tobacco; and in so far it might be said to be a\r\nsuccess: as mullein leaves are reputed to be feebly narcotic, hops are\r\nknown to possess anodyne properties, clover and hyssop are pectoral in\r\neffect, and slippery-elm febrifuge. Ginseng is aromatic and pungent, and\r\nhas a great reputation among the Chinese as a stimulant and restorative.\r\nThe tarred rope, we presume, is intended to add to the pyrognostic value\r\nof the mixture. The great point in selecting material for the\r\nfabrication of a mixture of this description is to get leaves containing\r\na fair percentage of nitrate of potass, as does tobacco; on this depends\r\nits pyrognostic value, and that, next to aroma, is everything.\r\n\r\n“Tobacco, like those who smoke it, is credited with many sins of which\r\nit is guiltless. The ‘loss of health’ so often laid at its door is\r\nprobably due in many instances not to tobacco itself, but to some\r\nvillainous compound bearing its name. A story told by the principal of\r\nthe laboratory of the Inland Revenue Department in his report for the\r\npast year shows how easily this may happen. The supervisor at\r\nBirmingham, observing that an article was being sold at a very cheap\r\nrate in packets, under the name of ‘smoking mixture,’ sent a sample to\r\nthe Inland Revenue laboratory for examination, and it being found to\r\ncontain a large proportion of vegetable matter resembling the broken-up\r\nheads of camomile flowers, further inquiry led to the discovery of the\r\nmanufactory. The process of manufacture consisted in exhausting the\r\nbitter principle of camomile flower-heads with water, and then dyeing\r\nand sweetening them with a solution of logwood and liquorice, which\r\nbrought them, when dried, somewhat to the colour of tobacco. The heads,\r\nwhen broken up, were then mixed with from 20 to 30 per cent. of cut\r\ntobacco, according to the price at which the mixture was to be sold. The\r\nmixture was supplied to retailers in packets labelled ‘The New Smoking\r\nMixture, Analysed and Approved,’ and as agencies had already been\r\nestablished in several towns, an extensive trade would no doubt soon\r\nhave arisen had the manufactory not been suppressed at an early stage of\r\nits existence.”\r\n\r\nThe United States Consul at Smyrna puts the following statement in his\r\nreport of January 15, 1883.\r\n\r\nSince the establishment of the tobacco monopoly in Turkey, snuff may be\r\nsaid to be one of the several articles that undergo the most\r\nunscrupulous adulteration. Owing to the high amount of duties imposed on\r\ntobacco by the Turkish Government, and the large profits licensed\r\nmanufacturers expect to make on the same, the poorer classes cannot\r\nafford to use the products of doubtful purity coming from the factories,\r\nand so are altogether at the mercy of the clandestine manufacturer and\r\nretailer, who, in order to make the most he can of his vile industry,\r\nadulterates his snuff to such an extent that it can be safely said that\r\nhis products contain on an average from 60 to 70 per cent. of inferior\r\nPersian tobacco (tumbeki), fragments of country tobacco leaf, and\r\ntobacco of cigarettes picked up in the streets by beggars, the 30 to 40\r\nper cent. consisting of walnut sawdust, terra umbra, fine sifted sand,\r\nand scum of lead (lead oxide), covered with inferior black writing-ink.\r\n\r\nThe snuff is manufactured in Smyrna, as follows:\r\n\r\nThe conscientious manufacturer uses Persian hookah tobacco (tumbeki) and\r\nthe fragments of country tobacco-leaf coloured with black ink. These\r\ntobaccos, ground as fine as possible and mixed with grape molasses, are\r\nput in a covered barrel to ferment. Two or three days later the snuff is\r\ntaken out and spread in the sun to dry partly, and then rubbed with the\r\nhands and passed through iron wire sieves to be granulated.\r\n\r\nThe product is afterwards scented with powdered orris root, tonka beans,\r\nand geranium oil; the superior qualities are scented with essences of\r\nroses and jessamine and put up in packages.\r\n\r\nThe adulterated article is manufactured in the same manner with the\r\naddition of the above-named substances.\r\n\r\nThe only persons using genuine snuff in this city are the Catholic\r\npriests, who import it directly from France, Italy, Spain and Holland,\r\nand enjoy the privilege of paying no custom-house duties.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER VIII.\r\n               IMPORTS, DUTIES, VALUES, AND CONSUMPTION.\r\n\r\n\r\nA comparison of the taxation of the chief nations of the world for the\r\nconsumption of tobacco has been published in the _Imperial Statistics of\r\nGermany_. Of the countries where the sale is a Government monopoly,\r\nFrance last year stood first, the gross duty, with profits, amounting to\r\n7_s._ 1½_d._ per head of the population annually, the net revenue from\r\nthe article being 5_s._ 8¼_d._ per head. In Austria the gross was 5_s._\r\n5¾_d._, the net, 3_s._ 5_d._; in Hungary, the gross 3_s._ 3½_d._, the\r\nnet 1_s._ 7_d._; in Italy, the gross 3_s._ 11_d._, and the net 2_s._\r\n8¼_d._ In Great Britain, the duty and licenses brought in 4_s._ 10¾_d._\r\nper head of the population for the year, and in the United States 4_s._\r\n4½_d._ In Germany, on the other hand, where the duty was very light, the\r\naverage was no more than 7¾_d._ per head of the population.\r\n\r\nThe duties on unmanufactured tobacco are 3_s._ 6_d._ a lb. when it\r\ncontains 10 per cent. or more of moisture; 3_s._ 10_d._ a lb. when it\r\ncontains less than 10 per cent. of moisture. Snuff containing no more\r\nthan 13 per cent. of moisture, 4_s._ 10_d._ a lb.; 13 per cent. and\r\nupwards, 4_s._ 1_d._ a lb. Cigars pay 5_s._ 6_d._ a lb. Cavendish of\r\nforeign manufacture pays 4_s._ 10_d._ a lb.; that manufactured in bond,\r\n4_s._ 4_d._ Other sorts, including cigarettes, pay 4_s._ 4_d._ a lb.\r\n\r\nThe approximate relative values in the London market are as\r\nfollows:—Maryland, fine yellow, fine, and good coloured, 7–9½_d._ a lb.;\r\ncolory, 5–7_d._; light-brown and leafy, 5–(7½)_d._; ordinary and brown,\r\n4–4½_d._ Virginia: Fine Irish and Scotch spinners, 7–10_d._; good and\r\nmiddling, ordinary light and dry, 6–10_d._; fine black sweet scent, and\r\nmiddling do., (6½)–(7½)_d._; part blacks, 5–6_d._; ordinary and heated,\r\n3–5_d._; mixed parcels, ordinary and good, middling and fine,\r\n(5½)–(6½)_d._; stripped leaf, 4_d._–1_s._ Kentucky: fine long light\r\nleaf, 7–11_d._; good to middling do., (5½)-(7½)_d._; fine and middling\r\nblacks, 6–8_d._; ordinary and mixed, 2–5_d._; stripped leaf, fine, light\r\nleafy, middling and ordinary, (4½)–11_d._ Negrohead, 11_d._–1_s._ 6_d._\r\nCavendish, 4½_d._–1_s._ Amersfort and German, 2¾_d._–1_s._ 6_d._ St.\r\nDomingo, 5–(7½)_d._ Havana, Cuba, and Yara, 1_s._ 2_d._–6_s._ Turkish\r\nand Greek, (2½)–9_d._ E.
