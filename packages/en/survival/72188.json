A precise answer to such a question is impossible and\r\nan adequate one demands a longer time than can usually be afforded.\r\nThe consequences of inadequate explanation have often proved to be\r\nunsatisfactory. The visitor becomes skeptical and instead of taking\r\ninterest in the subject, he seems to be confirmed in his doubts.\r\n\r\nIn this leaflet is given a condensed, general statement of methods\r\nof determining the age of ancient life. The information is drawn\r\nfrom the works of various authors, especially Barrell’s “Rhythms and\r\nMeasurements of Geologic Time.” It is intended for those who are\r\ninterested in the age of past life and yet do not intend an exhaustive\r\nstudy of the subject, nor have free and easy access to its literature.\r\n\r\nThe birth of life was the most momentous occasion in the history of\r\nthe earth. When one considers the myriads of evidences unearthed by\r\npaleontologists and paleobotanists, they seem to leave no room to doubt\r\nthe great conception that the life of the land has emerged from the\r\nsea. It is, therefore, only a natural impulse to look for the remains\r\nof this life in the rocks laid down by the ancient seas and to wonder\r\nat the vastness of time behind them.\r\n\r\nSince traces of the lowest forms of life have been found in\r\npractically the oldest known sedimentary strata, the problem of\r\ndetermining the age of life necessarily involves the determination of\r\nthe age of those strata. But unravelling the dead past is not an easy\r\ntask. One trying to unlock the “secrets of the cemetery of Nature’s\r\ndead,” walks on a shadowy road. His difficulties are many. It is like\r\ncrossing a deep moat, climbing a steep wall.\r\n\r\nVarious methods have been applied to estimate the age of different\r\nperiods of the earth’s history and much progress has been made toward\r\na successful issue. Broadly, the procedure of different methods is the\r\nsame. They do not differ in principle. “The rates of certain changes\r\nat the present day are determined as accurately as possible, and in\r\nimagination, the respective processes are traced backward in time until\r\nlimiting conditions are arrived at.” Until the epoch-making discovery\r\nof radium, the two most outstanding methods used in calculating\r\ngeologic time were (1) the rate of land erosion and deposition and (2)\r\nthe rate of derivation of salt (sodium chloride) from the land and its\r\naccumulation in the oceans. Theoretically, it is simple to use the rate\r\nat which sediments are being deposited or solutions gathered into the\r\nocean, as “geologic clocks” for estimating the length of past time. But\r\nin practice each method encounters its own difficulties and the results\r\ndeduced give us at best only a rough idea of the immensity of time\r\ninvolved. I shall not deal with these individual estimates, but give\r\nthe mean of several, which is 100,000,000 years, speaking roundly. As\r\nstated before, it is only a rough estimate. Nevertheless, it confirms\r\nthe fact that the earth is very old—indeed much older than is commonly\r\nbelieved. In 1650, Bishop Ussher, in his interpretation of the “In the\r\nbeginning” of Genesis, estimated that the earth was created 4004 years\r\nbefore the birth of Christ. According to this view the earth is 5931\r\nyears old today. Many cosmogonists and even some geologists of the 19th\r\ncentury held this Biblical interpretation to be the age of the earth.\r\nOther ancient religions held that the earth was created much earlier\r\nthen 4004 B.C. Hutton, one of the founders of Geology, in his studies,\r\nfound “no vestige of a beginning—no prospect of an end.” One cannot\r\nhelp sympathizing with Hutton. Whoever has made a trip to the Grand\r\nCanyon of the Colorado River, Arizona, must remember the awe-inspiring\r\ndepth of the Paleozoic strata and thousands of feet of Proterozoic\r\nsediments beneath them (Pl. I). If he has traveled farther north to\r\nthe Cabinet Range, Montana, he must have carried with him an undying\r\nimpression of the 35,000 ft. of the rocky monument, there built up by\r\nthe Proterozoic seas.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LEAFLET 9. PLATE II.\r\n\r\nCOMPARISON OF AN ANCIENT AND A MODERN MARINE ANIMAL OF ALLIED GROUPS.\r\n\r\n1, A CAMBRIAN TRILOBITE (AFTER WALCOTT). 2, A MODERN HORSESHOE CRAB.]\r\n\r\nThe present rate of denudation in the Hudson Bay region is one foot in\r\nabout 47,000 years. How long then, has it taken the seas to lay down\r\nthese miles of sediments, which are but a small fraction of the whole\r\ngeologic column? Having considered all this, can we estimate, even\r\napproximately, the vast length of time that has elapsed between these\r\nperiods of sedimentation, the so-called “gaps” or “breaks”—the torn,\r\nillegibly written pages of the history of the earth? Indeed, there are\r\nmoments when all may feel that it is much beyond their comprehension.\r\nBut, man, by nature, is at once humble and exalted. He is willing to\r\nadmit his defeat, yet his thirst to conquer new knowledge, to know the\r\ntruth, is never satiated.\r\n\r\nThe reason for the failure to arrive at an absolute result is not very\r\nfar to seek. In computing geologic time, one has to calculate that\r\nwhich has elapsed, by some process in nature that takes place in one\r\ndirection only and that does not change its rate when conditions alter.\r\nWhatever the method applied, be it the deposition of sediments, or the\r\ngathering of solutions, or the losing of heat by the sun and the earth,\r\nits rate of action should be uniform and uninterrupted. It should be\r\nindependent of the changing conditions of the earth. Uniformity of\r\nthe rate of action is the criterion for precise calculation. But we\r\nknow that the past was quite different from the present. Different\r\nconditions have existed at different times during the earth’s history.\r\nThe configuration of the earth, its climate, humidity, temperature and\r\nmany other factors have varied from time to time and with them the rate\r\nof erosion, deposition and solution has either accelerated, diminished\r\nor ceased. The doctrine of uniformitarianism cannot be assumed in a\r\nchanging world, even though our knowledge of the earth of the past can\r\nonly be gained from a fuller study of the earth of the present.\r\n\r\nWhen we consider the rate of sedimentation as a method for estimating\r\ngeologic time, we take the total observed thickness of the geologic\r\ncolumn, (estimated to be 70 miles) and divide it by the rate at which\r\nthe sediments are now being laid down. But do we know this rate? By\r\ntaking the average rate of sedimentation of nine large rivers[1] now\r\nin existence and assuming it to be the rate at which sediments were\r\ndeposited in the past, an approximate conclusion can be arrived at.\r\nBut it will be noticed from the figures of the rate of sedimentation\r\nof different rivers that they are widely variable, the highest being\r\nmany times greater than the lowest. Can we then use an average of nine\r\nfigures so out of proportion and yet expect a reliable quantitative\r\nvalue? Furthermore, the rate of deposition along the coast, near the\r\nmouth of a large and active river, is much higher than on a coastline\r\nwhere no rivers empty their sediments into the sea. The rate is also\r\nlargely controlled by the character of the sediments deposited.\r\nSandstone and shale are more rapidly deposited than limestone.\r\nMoreover, just as there is no knowledge of the duration of time of\r\nerosion between periods of sedimentation, there is also no record of\r\nthe amount of detritus that has fallen off the edge of the continental\r\nshelf during widespread emergence of the continents.\r\n\r\n[1]\r\n    -----------+-----------+-------------+-----------+------------------\r\n       River   | Drainage  | Total tons  | Ratio of  |Height in feet of\r\n               | areas in  |  annually   | sediment  |column of sediment\r\n               |  square   |             | to water  | with a base of\r\n               |   miles   |             | in weight | 1 square mile\r\n    -----------+-----------+-------------+-----------+------------------\r\n    Potomac    |    11,043 |   5,557,250 | 1: 3,575  |       4.0\r\n    Mississippi| 1,244,000 | 406,250,000 | 1: 1,500  |     241.4\r\n    Rio Grande |    30,000 |   3,830,000 | 1:   291  |       2.8\r\n    Uruguay    |   150,000 |  14,782,500 | 1:10,000  |      10.6\r\n    Rhone      |    34,800 |  36,000,000 | 1: 1,775  |      31.1\r\n    Po         |    27,100 |  67,000,000 | 1:   900  |      59.0\r\n    Danube     |   320,300 | 108,000,000 | 1: 2,800  |      93.2\r\n    Nile       | 1,100,000 |  54,000,000 | 1: 2,050  |      38.8\r\n    Irrawaddy  |   125,000 | 291,430,000 | 1: 1,610  |     209.0\r\n    -----------+-----------+-------------+-----------+------------------\r\n                Babb. Science, Vol. XXI, p. 343, 1893.\r\n\r\nWe have also no record of the vast quantity of shallow water sediments\r\nthat were stirred up by the penetration of storm waves, and carried to\r\nabyssal depths by the currents and tides.\r\n\r\nSimilar uncertainties beset us when we consider the rate of chemical\r\ndenudation, that is, the rate at which salts have been dissolved from\r\nthe lands and accumulated in the oceans, as a measure of geological\r\ntime. Here, again, we take the total amount of salts that is in the\r\noceans today and divide it by the present rate of annual supply. We\r\nknow with reasonable accuracy the quantity of salts in the oceans\r\nand if it were possible to assume the present rate of supply to be a\r\ntrue mean for all geological time, a satisfactory age of the oceans\r\nmight be obtained. But it cannot be assumed as such. An assumption of\r\nthis nature will only lead us from the domain of exactness to that of\r\nuncertainty. Aside from various other factors, neither the area of\r\nthe continents, nor their relief was in the past the same as today.\r\nConsequently, the stream gradient and its power of dissolving salts\r\nfrom the land surfaces have not been the same. It is also not known how\r\nmuch salt the ocean derived from the shore line and from beds beneath\r\nthe ocean, nor how much of the rock-salt beds on the earth that has\r\nbeen precipitated out of ocean water.\r\n\r\nIt is plain, therefore, that the rate of any process that is controlled\r\nby so many conditions cannot be used (even making generous allowances\r\nfor irregularities and inaccessible data) as a reliable guide to\r\nevaluate geologic time. “It is a clock,” says Harker, “which now\r\nhurries and now creeps or stands still, and it cannot be trusted as a\r\ntimekeeper.”\r\n\r\nAny estimate based on the temperature of the earth, or of the sun,\r\nencounters similar practical difficulties, for the temperature of a\r\nbody may not be constant. It may rise or it may fall. Further, the rate\r\nof change of temperature is controlled by a variety of conditions, such\r\nas the amount of energy radiated, the supply of energy and so forth.\r\nNor is there any record of the immense quantity of heat produced by\r\nigneous agencies and radio-activity.\r\n\r\nAnother estimate, one of the earliest, was based on the rate of life\r\ntransformation in successive periods. The geological series were\r\ndivided into twelve periods and it was believed that 20,000,000 years\r\nwere required for an entire change in the species of each period, or\r\n240,000,000 years in all. This does not include the time in which we\r\nhave no record of plant or animal life.\r\n\r\nThere is no reasonable debate as to the passage of one species to\r\nanother. It is clearly manifested in the succession of fauna found\r\ntoday all over the world in the sedimentary rocks. Even the most casual\r\nstudent of paleontology is convinced of this glaring truth. “The brutal\r\ncogency of a slab of fossils could be hated and fought, but could not\r\nbe gainsaid.” But when we are confronted with the question of setting\r\na standard of measuring geologic time by means of this paleontological\r\nrecord, more precisely, through this biological process, we cannot\r\nhelp pondering over the grave uncertainty of the result. When we fix\r\nour gaze upon a trilobite, a three-lobed, crab-like creature (Pl. II\r\nfig. 1) that ruled the seas in the dim days of the Cambrian period (p.\r\n11) and see that it was equipped with gills and swimming organs, with\r\npowers of digestion and excretion, with specific organs of circulation\r\nand reproduction and with motor and sensory nerves, and compare it\r\nwith one of its tribe, a present day horseshoe crab, (Pl. II fig. 2)\r\nwe do not find any noticeable progress in structure, in intricacy or\r\nin the degree of specialization. Yet the time that has elapsed since\r\nthe Cambrian is, according to a moderate estimate, nearly 600,000,000\r\nyears! (p. 11). Geologic record testifies that evolution awaits\r\nenvironmental change, that animals in some way adjust themselves to\r\ntheir environment, either by discarding or modifying old characters or\r\nby acquiring new ones. Yet, what are known as “immortal” types, such as\r\nthe brachiopods, Lingula, Crania and Terebratula (Pl. III figs. 1-3)\r\nor the pelecypods, such as Pecten, Pinna and Arca (Pl. III figs. 4-6)\r\nor the gastropods, such as Pleurotomaria, Natica and Trochus (Pl. III\r\nfigs. 7-9), have withstood all possible environmental changes and have\r\nsteadfastly held their own ever since we have records of their very\r\nearly appearance on earth. On the contrary, we have records of types\r\nthat have yielded so rapidly to change that their evolution is almost\r\nexplosive. It is almost incomprehensible how, within such a limited\r\nperiod of time, fishes have changed into amphibians, amphibians into\r\nreptiles, and reptiles into birds and mammals (Pl. IV figs. 1-4). With\r\nthese conflicting evidences staring us in the face, with the knowledge\r\nthat the entire organic world has been subject to earth-wide periods\r\nof long stagnation and rapid intensive change, one may well ponder\r\nwhether it is within our power to establish a standard for measuring\r\ngeologic time on the evidence of life transformation. The study of the\r\nsuccession of faunas—the change of one species to another, can only\r\nindicate the magnitude of time involved. It cannot afford any basis,\r\nwhatsoever, for a concrete expression of geologic time.\r\n\r\nDuring the last three decades, a number of radio-active changes of\r\none chemical element into another have been discovered and studies of\r\ncertain minerals and rocks containing various radio-active elements\r\nhave created means to calculate their age with remarkable accuracy.\r\n“A study of the various radio-active elements contained in minerals\r\nand rocks,” says Harker, “has shown that it is possible, in certain\r\nfavorable cases, to calculate directly their age in years.”\r\n\r\nThe radio-active minerals are commonly found in igneous rocks. They\r\nare widely distributed all over the world. The parents of the whole\r\nseries of radio-active elements are uranium and thorium. They possess\r\nthe highest atomic weights of all known elements. Each of these\r\nparental elements transforms itself through a succession of changes.\r\nThe final product of uranium is the formation of the metal lead and\r\nthe gas helium. These transformations take place in one direction\r\nonly, that is, from an element of higher atomic weight to an element\r\nof lower atomic weight. It has also been demonstrated beyond question\r\nthat these transformations are unalterable by any process whatsoever\r\nand that they are independent of temperature, pressure or any other\r\nphysical or chemical state. Temperatures up to 2,500 C. and pressures\r\nup to 600 tons per square inch have not been found to influence the\r\nrate of transformation. Time estimated on the basis of these processes,\r\ntherefore, offers a more reliable result than that obtained by any\r\nother method hitherto known. Detailed descriptions of how the metal\r\nuranium slowly and regularly breaks down in a descending series into\r\nthe metal lead and the gas helium, will be found in the literature on\r\nradio-activity. For our purpose, it suffices to say that according to\r\nBarrell, an atom of uranium which breaks up will ultimately give rise\r\nas a stable product to eight atoms of helium and one atom of lead.\r\nSince the rate of transformation is known, data for calculating the age\r\nof the mineral and with it the rock formation of which it is a part,\r\ncan be obtained by measuring the quantity of helium and lead in the\r\nrock and comparing it with the quantity of uranium in the same volume\r\nof material. But, as helium is a gas, it is likely that a certain\r\nportion of it leaks out and consequently the estimate of age on the\r\nbasis of how long helium had been in contact with uranium and lead is\r\nto be regarded as a minimum estimate. For example, the age of the\r\nmineral thorianite that occurs abundantly in the sands and gravels of\r\nCeylon has been estimated to be 280,000,000 years, but the mineral\r\nis doubtless much older, as, ever since it was broken away from its\r\noriginal home in the pegmatite dikes of Ceylon, it lay exposed to the\r\naction of weathering and it was, therefore, very likely that during all\r\nthese years a certain percentage of its helium contents had leaked away.\r\n\r\nBut estimates based on the lead ratios of radio-active minerals offer\r\nresults consistent among themselves. That is, whenever fresh, primary,\r\nuranium-bearing minerals of the same geological age have been examined,\r\nthe lead ratios are always found to remain constant. The value of the\r\nratios increases or decreases as the geological age of the respective\r\nmineral increases or decreases. In other words, the lead ratios are in\r\nkeeping with the geological age.\r\n\r\nThe procedure of applying the lead ratio in calculating geological time\r\ncan be briefly stated thus: The rate of production of lead from uranium\r\ncan be readily calculated. The rate at which helium is generated is\r\naccurately known and the quantity of lead liberated in the same time is\r\napproximately 6.5 times that of helium. In a year one gram of uranium\r\nproduces 1.25 × 10⁻¹⁰ grams of lead, and at this rate 8,000[2] million\r\nyears will be required for the production of one gram of lead.\r\n\r\n[2] A more recent and accurate computation reduces this 8,000 million\r\nyears to 7,500 million years.\r\n\r\nThere is no serious difficulty in applying this method for measuring\r\ngeologic time, except that it is necessary to determine whether\r\nthe lead is of radio-active origin or original lead. The presence\r\nof original lead is likely to mar the constancy of the lead ratio\r\nessential for accurate results. But ordinary lead need not be confused\r\nwith uranium lead, as the atomic weight of ordinary lead is 207.1 and\r\nthat of uranium lead is 206.2. Values between these two figures imply\r\na mixture of two types of lead. For reliable calculations, a series of\r\nfresh, primary minerals of the same geological age showing a constant\r\nlead ratio of atomic weight 206.2 needs to be examined.\r\n\r\nThe following table shows the geologic time that has elapsed\r\nbetween the first evidences of life and the present, as calculated\r\nby Barrell from radio-active data. The figures are his minimum and\r\nmaximum estimates. It will be noticed from the figures in the table\r\nthat the earliest life of which we have fossil records is about\r\n1,500,000,000 years old. From this, it could be safely concluded that\r\nthe inception of life on earth must have taken place much earlier.\r\nIt is quite significant that each geological era, occasionally a\r\ngeological period, has its characteristic grouping of life developed\r\nfrom the life of preceding periods. As we climb higher in the\r\ngeological column, life becomes more and more complex and specialized.\r\nFrom the one-celled life of the Archeozoic it passes through the\r\ninvertebrates—fishes—amphibians—reptiles—birds and mammals to man\r\nof the Recent time.\r\n\r\nSince Barrell’s publication of the estimates of geologic time as\r\nmeasured by means of radio-activity, some further studies have been\r\nmade along the same line, but, as no generally accepted results have\r\nshown any marked differences from Barrell’s results, it has been deemed\r\nadvisable to use his age data as perhaps our present most adequate\r\nguide as to the length of geologic periods.\r\n\r\nAlthough the measurable forces of radio-activity give on the whole a\r\nremarkably satisfactory time gauge and are doubtless more accurate\r\nthan any method here discussed, it must not be considered that the\r\nages given (p. 11) are absolute. The knowledge of geological time is\r\nof more importance for the comparative than for the absolute magnitude\r\nof the results obtained. Just as the study of astronomy gives us the\r\nconception of the vastness of space, so does the study of geology\r\nreveal to us that of the immensity of time.\r\n\r\n    SHARAT K.
