His mother\r\nlooked upon him as one that would pass through some great events, and\r\nshe resolved to have him push his fortune at sea, where he went in\r\nhis nineteenth year, to escape the rebuke of his unruly conduct. He\r\nwas from home six years; and again being guilty of very bad behavior,\r\nand having beaten a young infirm brother, and raised a riot in his\r\nfather’s house, he was publicly reprimanded: upon this, he left home,\r\nand being a skilful seaman, was appointed Sailing Master, in a\r\nvessel called the Cinque Ports—a small sailor which went in company\r\nwith captain Dampier to the South Sea.\r\n\r\nHaving quarrelled with his captain, and having had a dream that his\r\nship would be wrecked, he resolved to quit it, and was set on shore\r\nat the uninhabited island of _Juan Fernandez_. He had scarcely left\r\nthe boat, when he sorely repented, and he “never heard a sound more\r\ndismal than their parting oars.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Selkirk sitting on rock]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Selkirk catching Seals.]\r\n\r\nFrom the beginning to the end of September, the vessel remained\r\nundergoing repairs. The disagreement, instead of being made up,\r\nbecame greater every day, and strengthened the resolution which\r\nSelkirk had made to leave the vessel. This was accordingly concluded\r\non, and just before getting under way, he was landed with all his\r\neffects; and he leaped on shore with a faint sensation of freedom\r\nand joy. He shook hands with his comrades, and bade them adieu in\r\na hearty manner, while the officer sat in the boat urging their\r\nreturn to the ship, which order they instantly obeyed; but no sooner\r\ndid the sound of their oars, as they left the beach, fall on his\r\nears, than the horrors of being left alone, cut off from all human\r\nsociety, perhaps forever, rushed upon his mind. His heart sunk\r\nwithin him, and all his resolution failed. He rushed into the water,\r\nand implored them to return and take him on board with them. To all\r\nhis entreaties his comrades turned a deaf ear, and even mocked his\r\ndespair; denouncing the choice he had made of remaining upon the\r\nisland, as rank mutiny, and describing his present situation as the\r\nmost proper state for such a fellow, where his example would not\r\naffect others.\r\n\r\nFor many days after being left alone, Selkirk was under such great\r\ndejection of mind, that he never tasted food until urged by extreme\r\nhunger; nor did he go to sleep until he could watch no longer; but\r\nsat with his eyes fixed in the direction where he had seen his\r\nshipmates depart, fondly hoping that they would return and free\r\nhim from his misery. Thus he remained seated upon his chest, until\r\ndarkness shut out every object from his sight. Then did he close his\r\nweary eyes, but not in sleep; for morning found him still anxiously\r\nhoping the return of the vessel.\r\n\r\nWhen urged by hunger, he fed upon seals and such shell-fish as he\r\ncould pick up along the shore. The reason of this was the aversion he\r\nfelt to leave the beach, and the care he took to save his powder.\r\nThough seals, and shell-fish were but sorry fare, his greatest cross\r\nwas the want of salt and bread, which made him loathe his food until\r\nhe got used to it.\r\n\r\nIt was in the beginning of October (1704,) which in those southern\r\nlatitudes is the middle of spring, when nature appears in a thousand\r\nvarieties of form and fragrance, quite unknown in northern climates;\r\nbut the agitation of his mind, and the forlorn situation in which he\r\nwas now placed, caused all its charms to be unregarded.\r\n\r\nIt was in this trying situation, when his mind, deprived of all\r\noutward occupation, was turned back upon itself, that the whole\r\nadvantages of that great blessing, a religious education in his\r\nyouth, was felt in its consoling influences, when every other hope\r\nand comfort had fled.\r\n\r\nThis circumstance ought to lead young people to prize their social\r\nand religious privileges, as they know not but that some day, like\r\nSelkirk, their lot may be cast far from home, and from pious family\r\nopportunities, the absence of which were then so much regretted by\r\nthis lonely man.\r\n\r\nBy slow degrees he became easy to his fate; and as winter approached,\r\nhe saw the necessity of procuring some kind of shelter from the\r\nweather; for even in that temperate climate, frost is common during\r\nthe night, and snow is sometimes found upon the ground in the morning.\r\n\r\nThe building of a hut was the first thing that roused him to\r\nexertion; and his necessary absence from the shore gradually weaned\r\nhis heart from that aim which had alone filled all his thoughts and\r\nproved a help of his obtaining that peace of mind he afterwards\r\nenjoyed; but it was eighteen months before he became fully composed,\r\nor could be one whole day absent from the beach, and from his usual\r\nhopeless watch for some vessel to relieve him from his melancholy\r\nsituation.\r\n\r\nDuring his stay, he built himself two huts with the wood of the\r\npimento tree, and thatched them with a species of grass, that grows\r\nto the height of seven or eight feet upon the plains and smaller\r\nhills, and produces straw resembling that of oats. The one was much\r\nlarger than the other, and situated near a spacious wood.\r\n\r\nThis he made his sleeping room, spreading the bed clothes he had\r\nbrought on shore with him upon a frame of his own construction;\r\nand as those wore out, or were used for other purposes, he supplied\r\ntheir places with goat skins. His pimento bed-room he used also as\r\nhis chapel; for here he kept up that simple but beautiful form of\r\nfamily worship which he had been accustomed to in his father’s house.\r\nTo distinguish the Sabbath, he kept an exact account of the days of\r\nevery week and month, during the time he remained upon the island.\r\n\r\nThe smaller hut, which Selkirk had erected at some distance from the\r\nother, was used by him as a kitchen in which he dressed his victuals.\r\nThe furniture was very scanty; but consisted of every convenience his\r\nisland could afford. His most valuable article was the pot or kettle\r\nhe had brought from the ship, to boil his meat in; the spit was his\r\nown handiwork, made of such wood as grew upon the island; the rest\r\nwas suitable to his rudely built house. Around his dwelling browsed a\r\nparcel of goats remarkably tame, which he had taken when young, and\r\nlamed, but so as not to injure their health, while he kept down their\r\nspeed. These he kept as a store, in the event of a sickness or any\r\naccident befalling him, that might prevent him from catching others;\r\nhis sole method of doing which, was running them down by speed of\r\nfoot. The pimento wood, which burns very bright and clear served him\r\nboth for fuel and candle. It gives out an agreeable perfume while\r\nburning.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Selkirk reading his Bible.]\r\n\r\nHe obtained fire after the Indian method, by rubbing two pieces of\r\npimento wood together until they caught fire. This he did, as being\r\nill able to spare any of his linen for tinder, time being of no\r\nvalue to him, and the labour rather an amusement. Having recovered\r\nhis peace of mind, he began likewise to enjoy greater variety in his\r\nfood, and was continually adding some new thing to his store. The\r\ncraw-fish, many of which weighed eight or nine pounds, he broiled or\r\nboiled as his fancy led, seasoning it with pimento, (Jamaica pepper)\r\nand at length came to relish his food without salt.\r\n\r\nAs a substitute for bread, he used the cabbage-palm, which was plenty\r\non the island; turnips, or their tops, and likewise a species of\r\nparsnip, of good taste and flavor. He had also Sicilian radishes and\r\nwatercresses, which he found in the neighboring brooks, as well as\r\nmany other vegetables found on the island, which he ate with his fish\r\nor goat’s flesh.\r\n\r\nHaving food in abundance, and the climate being healthy and pleasant,\r\nin about eighteen months he became easy in his situation. The time\r\nhung no longer heavy upon his hands. His devotions and frequent\r\nstudy of the Scriptures, soothed and elevated his mind: and this,\r\ncoupled with the vigor of his health, and a constant serene sky, and\r\ntemperate air, rendered his life one continual feast. His feelings\r\nwere now as joyful as they had before been sorrowful. He took delight\r\nin every thing around him; fixed up the hut in which he lay, with\r\nfragrant branches, cut from a spacious wood, on the side of which\r\nit was situated, and thereby formed a pleasant bower, fanned with\r\ncontinual breezes, soft and balmy as poets describe, which made his\r\nrepose, after the fatigues of the chase, very gratifying.\r\n\r\nYet happy and contented as he became, there were cares that broke\r\nin upon his pleasing thoughts, as it were to place his situation\r\non a level with that of other human beings; for it is the lot of\r\nman to care while he dwells on earth. During the early part of his\r\nresidence, he was much annoyed by multitudes of rats, which gnawed\r\nhis feet and other parts of his body, as he slept during the night.\r\nTo remedy this evil, he caught and tamed after much exertion and\r\npatient toil, some of the cats that ran wild on the island. These\r\nnew friends soon put the rats to flight, and became themselves\r\nthe companions of his leisure hours. He amused himself by teaching\r\nthem to dance, and do a number of antic feats. They multiplied so\r\nfast too, under his fostering hand, that they lay upon his bed, and\r\nupon the floor in great numbers: and although freed from his former\r\ntroublesome visitors, yet, so strangely are we formed, that when one\r\ncare is removed, another takes its place.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Selkirk amusing himself with his Cats.]\r\n\r\nThese very protectors became a source of great uneasiness to him:\r\nfor the idea haunted his mind, and made him at times melancholy,\r\nthat, after his death there would be no one to bury his remains, or\r\nto supply the cats with food, his body must be devoured by the very\r\nanimals which he at present nourished for his convenience.\r\n\r\nThe island abounds in goats, which he shot while his powder lasted,\r\nand afterwards caught by speed of foot. At first he could only\r\novertake kids: but latterly, so much did his frugal life, joined to\r\nair and exercise, improve his strength and habits of body, that he\r\ncould run down the strongest goat on the island in a few minutes, and\r\ntossing it over his shoulders, carry it with ease to his hut. All\r\nthe by-ways and easy parts of the mountains became familiar to him.\r\nHe could bound from crag to crag, and slip down the precipices with\r\nconfidence.\r\n\r\nWith these helps, hunting soon became his chief amusement. It was his\r\ncustom, after running down the animals, to slit their ears, and then\r\nallow them to escape. The young he carried to the green lawn beside\r\nhis hut, and employed his leisure hours in taming them. They in time\r\nsupplied him with milk, and even with amusement, as he taught them as\r\nwell as the cats to dance; and he often afterwards declared, that he\r\nnever danced with a lighter heart, or greater spirit, any where, to\r\nthe best of music, than he did to the sound of his own voice, with\r\nhis dumb companions.\r\n\r\nAs the northern part of the island where Alexander lived, is composed\r\nof high craggy precipices, many of which are almost too hilly to\r\nclimb, though generally covered with wood, the soil is loose and\r\nshallow, so that on the hills the largest trees soon perish for want\r\nof nourishment, and are then very easily overturned. This was the\r\ncause of the death of a seaman belonging to the Dutchess, who being\r\non the high ground in search of goats, caught hold of a tree to aid\r\nhis ascent, when it gave way and he rolled down the hill. In his\r\nfall he grasped another of considerable bulk, which likewise failed\r\nhim, and he was thrown amongst the rocks and dashed to pieces. Mr.\r\nButt also met with an accident, merely by leaning his back to a tree\r\nnearly as thick as himself, which stood upon a slope, almost without\r\nany hold of the soil.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Selkirk catching a Goat.]\r\n\r\nOur adventurer, himself nearly lost his life from a similar cause.\r\nWhen pursuing a goat, he made a snatch at it on the brink of a\r\nprecipice, of which he was not aware, as some bushes concealed it\r\nfrom them; the animal suddenly stopped; upon which he stretched\r\nforward his hand to seize it, when the branches gave way, and they\r\nboth fell from a great height. Selkirk was so stunned and bruised by\r\nthe fall, that he lay deprived of sensation and almost of life. Upon\r\nhis recovery, he found the goat lying dead beneath him. This happened\r\nabout a mile from his hut. Scarcely was he able to crawl to it when\r\nrestored to his senses; and dreadful were his sufferings during\r\nthe first two or three of the ten days that he was confined by the\r\ninjury. This was the only disagreeable accident that befel him during\r\nhis long residence on the island.\r\n\r\nW. Rogers says that Selkirk lay above the goat deprived of sensation,\r\nfor 24 hours; Sir R. Steele mentions three days. Selkirk, computed\r\nthe length of time by the moon’s growth from the last observation\r\nwhich he had made on the evening before his fall.\r\n\r\nHe occasionally amused himself by cutting upon the trees his name,\r\nand the date when he was left on the island, and at times added to\r\nthe first the period of his continuance; so averse is man to be\r\nutterly forgotten by his fellow-man. Perishable as the material was\r\nupon which he wrought, still the idea was pleasing to his lonely\r\nmind, that when he should have ended his lonely life, some future\r\nnavigator would learn from these rude memorials, Alexander Selkirk\r\nhad lived and died upon the island. He had no materials for writing\r\nwherewith to trace a more ample record. Upon Lord Anson’s arrival,\r\nhowever at Juan Fernandez, in the year 1741, there was not, so far as\r\nhe observed, one of these names or dates to be discovered upon any of\r\nthe trees.\r\n\r\nAbbe Raynal is not correct, when he says that Selkirk lost his speech\r\nwhile upon the island. All that Cook asserts is, that, at his first\r\ncoming on board, he spoke his words as it were by halves, from\r\nwant of practice; while he states distinctly, that he carried on\r\nconversation from the first and that his hesitating manner gradually\r\nwore off.\r\n\r\nAs to his clothing it was very rude. Shoes he had none, as they\r\nwere soon worn out. This gave him very little concern, and he never\r\ntroubled himself in contriving any thing to supply their place. As\r\nhis other clothes decayed, he dried the skins of the goats he had\r\nkilled, to make into garments, sewing them with slender thongs of\r\nleather, which he cut for the purpose, and using a sharp nail for\r\na needle. In this way he made for himself a cap, jacket, and short\r\nbreeches. The hair being left upon the skin, gave him a very strange\r\nappearance; but in this dress he ran through the underwood, and\r\nreceived as little injury as the animal he pursued. Having linen\r\ncloth with him, he made it into shirts, sewing them by means of his\r\nnail, and the thread of his worsted stockings, which he untwisted for\r\nthat purpose. Thus rudely equipped, he thought his wants sufficiently\r\nsupplied, fashion having no longer any rule over him. His goats and\r\ncats being his sole companions, he was at least neighbor-like, and\r\nlooked as wild as they; his beard was of great length, as it had been\r\nuntouched since he left the ship. Still his mind was at ease, and\r\nhe danced and sang amongst his dumb companions, for hours together;\r\nperhaps as happy a man, nay happier, than the gayest ball-room could\r\nhave presented, in the most civilized country upon earth.\r\n\r\nOne day, in his ramble along the beach, he found a few iron hoops,\r\nwhich had been left by some vessel, as unworthy to be taken away.\r\nThis was to him a discovery that imparted more joy than if he had\r\nfound a treasure of gold or silver; for with them he made knives when\r\nhis own was worn out, and bad as they were, they stood him in great\r\nstead. One of them, which he had used as a chopper, was about two\r\nfeet in length, and was long kept as a curiosity, at the Golden Head\r\nCoffee-house, near Buckingham Gate, in England. It had been changed\r\nfrom its original simple form, having when last seen, a buck’s horn\r\nhandle with some verses upon it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Selkirk fired upon by the Spaniards.]\r\n\r\nAlexander Selkirk, at different times during his stay, saw vessels\r\npass the island; but only two ever came to an anchor. At these times\r\nhe concealed himself; but, being anxious on one occasion to learn\r\nwhether the ship was French or Spanish, he approached too near, and\r\nwas perceived. A pursuit immediately commenced, and several shots\r\nwere fired in the direction in which he fled; but fortunately none of\r\nthem took effect, and he got up into a tree unobserved. His pursuers\r\nstopped near it, and killed several of his goats, but the vessel soon\r\nleft the island. Cook says, “The prize being so inconsiderable, it is\r\nlikely they thought it not worth while to be at great trouble to find\r\nit.” Had they been French, Alexander would have given himself up to\r\nthem; but, being Spaniards, he chose rather to stay upon the island,\r\nand run the risk of dying alone, and even of being devoured by his\r\nown cats, than fall into their hands, as they would, as he supposed,\r\neither have murdered him in cold blood, or caused him to linger out\r\na life of misery in the mines of Peru or Mexico, unless he chose to\r\nprofess himself a Roman Catholic, and even then he would have been\r\ncompelled to pass his weary days in one of their coasting vessels in\r\nthe Pacific Ocean; for as we have already mentioned, it was one of\r\ntheir maxims never to allow an Englishman to return to Europe, who\r\nhad gained any knowledge of the South Seas.\r\n\r\nThis adventure made him resolve to use more caution in future;\r\nnever a day passed but he anxiously looked out for some sail over\r\nthe vast expanse of ocean that lay before him; for, even in all his\r\ntranquillity and peace of mind, the wish to leave the island never\r\nentirely ceased to occupy his thoughts, and he would still have\r\nhailed the arrival of an English ship with rapture.\r\n\r\nOn the 31st of January, 1709, behold! two English ships _did_\r\nheave in sight of Alexander Selkirk’s dominions who was as usual,\r\nanxiously watching the watery waste. Slowly the vessels rose into\r\nview, and he could scarcely believe the sight real; for often had he\r\nbeen deceived before. They gradually approached the island, and he\r\nat length ascertained them to be English. Great was the tumult of\r\npassion that rose in his mind; but the love of home overpowered them\r\nall. It was late in the afternoon when they first came in sight, and\r\nlest they should sail again without knowing that there was a person\r\non the island, he prepared a quantity of wood to burn as soon as it\r\nwas dark. He kept his eyes fixed upon them until night fall, and then\r\nkindled his fire, and kept it up till morning dawned. His hopes and\r\nfears having banished all desire for sleep, he employed himself\r\nin killing several goats, and in preparing an entertainment for his\r\nexpected guests, knowing how acceptable it would be to them after\r\ntheir long run, with nothing but salt provision to live upon.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: “Slowly the vessels rose into view.”]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Selkirk running to the boat.]\r\n\r\nWhen the day at length opened, he still saw them, but at a distance\r\nfrom the shore. His fire had caused great wonder on board, for they\r\nknew the island to be uninhabited, and supposed the light to have\r\nproceeded from some French ships at anchor, with which nation,\r\nEngland was then at war. In this conclusion they prepared for action,\r\nas they must either fight or want water and other refreshments,\r\nand stood to their quarters all night ready to engage; but, not\r\nperceiving any vessel, they next day, about noon, sent a boat\r\non shore, with Capt. Dover, Mr. Fry, and six men, all armed, to\r\nascertain the cause of the fire, and to see that all was safe.\r\n\r\nAlexander saw the boat leave the Duke, and pull for the beach. He\r\nran down joyfully to meet his countrymen, and to hear once more the\r\nhuman voice. He took in his hand a piece of linen tied upon a small\r\npole as a flag, which he waved as they drew near, to attract their\r\nattention. At length he heard them call to him, inquiring for a good\r\nplace to land, which he pointed out, and flying as swift as a deer\r\ntowards it, arrived first, where he stood ready to receive them as\r\nthey stepped on shore. He embraced them by turns; but his joy was\r\ntoo great for utterance, while their astonishment at his strange\r\nappearance, struck them dumb. He had at this time his last shirt upon\r\nhis back: his feet and legs were bare, his thighs and body covered\r\nwith the skins of wild animals. His beard, which had not been shaved\r\nfor four years and four months, was of a great length, while a rough\r\ngoat’s-skin cap covered his head. He appeared to them as wild as the\r\nfirst owners of the skins which he wore. At length they began to\r\nconverse, and he invited them to his hut: but its access was so very\r\nintricate, that only Captain Fry went with him over the rocks which\r\nled to it. When Alexander had entertained him in the best manner he\r\ncould, they returned to the boat, our hero bearing a quantity of his\r\nroasted goat’s-flesh, for the refreshment of the crew. During their\r\nrepast, he gave them an account of his adventures and stay upon the\r\nisland, at which they were much surprised. Captains Dover and Fry\r\ninvited him to come on board; but he declined their invitation,\r\nuntil they had satisfied him that Dampier had no command in this\r\nexpedition; after which he gave a reluctant consent.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Sailships]\r\n\r\nSo great was his aversion to Dampier as a commander after the\r\nexperience he had of him, that he would rather have remained upon\r\nhis island, its lonely possessor, now that he was reconciled to\r\nhis fate, than have endured the hardships and trials he had before\r\nexperienced under that navigator. This feeling must have arisen, not\r\nfrom any quarrel or personal dislike to Dampier, but from a knowledge\r\nof his former misconduct in his adventures, arising from his want of\r\nconstancy in carrying through any object which he professed to have\r\nin view.\r\n\r\nWhen he came on board the Duke, Dampier gave him an excellent\r\ncharacter, telling Captain Rogers that Selkirk had been the best\r\nman on board the Cinque Ports. Upon this recommendation, he was\r\nimmediately engaged on board the Duke. In the afternoon, the ships\r\nwere cleared, the sails bent and taken on shore to be mended, and\r\nto make tents for the sick men. Selkirk’s strength and vigor were\r\nof great service to them. He caught two goats in the afternoon.\r\nThey sent along with him their swiftest runners and a bull-dog; but\r\nthese he soon left far behind, and tired out. He himself, to the\r\nastonishment of the whole crew, brought the two goats upon his back\r\nto the tents.\r\n\r\nThe two captains remained at the island until the 12th of the month,\r\nbusy refitting their ships, and getting on board what stores they\r\ncould obtain. During these ten days, Alexander was their huntsman,\r\nand procured them fresh meat. At length all being ready, they set\r\nsail, when a new series of difficulties of another kind, annoyed\r\nSelkirk, similar to those he had felt at his arrival upon the island.\r\nThe salt food he could not relish for a long time, having so long\r\ndiscontinued the use of it; for which reason he lived upon biscuit\r\nand water. Spirits he did not like from the same cause; and besides\r\nhe was afraid of falling into intemperance, for his religious\r\nimpressions were as yet strong. From the confirmed habit of living\r\nalone, he kept very much to himself, and said little. This frame of\r\nmind, and a serious countenance, continued longer than could have\r\nbeen expected. Even for some time after his return to England, these\r\nqualities were remarkable, and drew the notice of those to whose\r\ncompany he was introduced. Shoes gave him great uneasiness when he\r\nfirst came on board. He had been so long without them, that they\r\nmade his feet swell, and crippled his movements; but this wore off\r\nby degrees, and he became once more reconciled to their use. In\r\nother respects he gradually resumed his old habits as a seaman,\r\nbut without the vices which sometimes attach to the profession. He\r\nrigidly abstained from profane oaths, and was much respected by both\r\ncaptains, as well on account of his singular adventure, as of his\r\nskill and good conduct; for, having had his books with him, he had\r\nimproved himself much in navigation during his solitude.\r\n\r\nThe articles he took on shore from the Cinque Ports, were the\r\nfollowing: His chest, containing his clothes and a quantity of linen,\r\nnow all spent, his musket, which he brought home with him; a pound of\r\npowder, and balls in proportion; a hatchet and some tools; a knife;\r\na pewter kettle; his flip-can which he conveyed to Scotland, (at\r\npresent in the possession of John Selcraig, his great-grand-nephew;)\r\na few pounds of tobacco; the Holy Bible; some devotional pieces, and\r\none or two books on navigation, with his mathematical instruments.\r\n\r\nIn the capacity of mate, he cruised about for a time, during which\r\nseveral prizes were taken, and on his return to London, after an\r\nabsence of eight years, one month and three days, he found himself\r\nin possession of £800 sterling. As soon as this sum was realized, he\r\nset out for Largo, and arrived in the spring of 1712, at his native\r\nvillage.\r\n\r\nIt was in the forenoon of a Sabbath day, when all were at church,\r\nthat he knocked at the door of his paternal dwelling, but found\r\nnot those whom his heart yearned to see, and his soul longed to\r\nembrace. He set out for church, prompted by his piety and his love\r\nfor his parents; for great was the change that had taken place in\r\nhis feelings since he had last been within its walls. As soon as he\r\nentered and sat down, all eyes were upon him, for such a personage,\r\nperhaps, had seldom been seen within the church at Largo. He was\r\nelegantly dressed in gold laced clothes; besides, he was a stranger,\r\nwhich in a country church, is matter of attention to the hearers\r\nat all times. But his manner and appearance would have attracted\r\nthe notice of more observing spectators.—After remaining some time\r\nengaged in devotion, his eyes were ever turning to where his parents\r\nand brothers sat, while theirs as often met his gaze; still they\r\ndid not know him. At length his mother, whose thoughts perhaps at\r\nthis time wandered to her long lost son, knew him, and uttering a\r\ncry of joy, could contain herself no longer. Even in the Meeting\r\nHouse, she rushed to his arms, unconscious of the impropriety of\r\nher conduct, and the interruption of the service. Alexander and his\r\nfriends immediately retired to his father’s house, to give free scope\r\nto their joy and congratulations.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Church and school]\r\n\r\nA few days passed away happily in the society of his parents and\r\nfriends; but from long habits, he soon felt averse to mixing\r\nin society, and was happiest when alone. Returning, therefore,\r\nfrequently to Keil’s Den, a secluded and lonely valley in the\r\nneighborhood, he spent most of his time in solitary wandering and\r\nmeditation; till a new object began to engross much of his attention.\r\nIn his musing by the burnside, he often met a young girl, tending a\r\nsingle cow, the property of her parents.\r\n\r\nHer lonely occupation and innocent looks, made a deep impression upon\r\nhim. He watched her for hours unseen, as she amused herself with\r\nthe wild flowers she gathered, or chaunted her rural lays. At each\r\nmeeting the impression became stronger, and he felt more interested\r\nin this modest female. At length he addressed himself to her, and\r\nthey joined in conversation; he had no aversion to commune with her\r\nfor hours together, and began to imagine that he could live and be\r\nhappy with a companion such as she. His fishing expeditions were now\r\nneglected. Even his cave became not so sweet a retreat. His mind led\r\nhim to Keil’s Den, and the amiable Sophia. He never mentioned this\r\nadventure and attachment to his friends; for he felt ashamed, after\r\nhis discourses to them, and the profession he had made of dislike\r\nto human society, to acknowledge that he was upon the point of\r\nmarrying, and thereby plunging into the midst of worldly cares. But\r\nhe was determined to marry Sophia, though as firmly resolved not to\r\nremain at home to be the subject of their jest. This resolution being\r\nformed, he soon persuaded the object of his choice, to elope with\r\nhim, and bid adieu to the romantic glen.\r\n\r\nAfter this elopement, nothing was heard of him for some years. At\r\nlength, however, a gay widow, of the name of Frances Candis, or\r\nCandia, came to Largo, to claim the property left to him by his\r\nfather, and produced documents to prove her right, from which it\r\nappeared that Sophia Bruce lived but a very few years after her\r\nmarriage. He himself, after attaining the rank of Lieutenant, died on\r\nboard his Majesty’s ship Weymouth, some time in the year 1723.\r\n\r\n\r\nPOSTSCRIPT.\r\n\r\nThe chest and cup which Selkirk had with him on the island, are\r\nin the possession of a family in Nether Largo, in Fifeshire, who\r\nreside in the house in which he was born.

Mr. Starboard\r\nis one of those redoubted travellers, who are generally the heroes\r\nof their best stories, and his adventures are no less varied than\r\nwonderful. But we will let him speak for himself:\r\n\r\n“I was two years and a few days wandering over South America. I\r\ntravelled about one thousand eight hundred miles; but I did not walk\r\nall the way; oh no! I frequently went with the Indians up their\r\nrivers; and for about five hundred miles I rode on mules, or wild\r\nhorses, which I caught by stratagem.\r\n\r\n“At night I would find a tree, and lace a rope in and out of two\r\nboughs, so as to form a kind of cradle; thus supported, I slept in\r\npeace, excepting that sometimes the vampire bat would annoy me by\r\nsucking my blood; he did it though so quietly, that I suffered no\r\npain; and perhaps it was serviceable to me to lose a little blood;\r\nit is not improbable that these flying surgeons kept me in health by\r\ntheir gentle bleedings. The vampire bat does not subsist entirely by\r\nsucking the blood of living animals; it feeds also on insects and\r\nyoung fruits.\r\n\r\n“One morning, I remember, when I awoke, and was coming down from my\r\ncradle, I found that a rattle snake had coiled itself round the stem\r\nof the tree, and then I really thought it would be all over with me;\r\nbut my presence of mind did not forsake me even in this case; for, as\r\nthe reptile reared his flat, wide, terrible head, I took such good\r\naim, and was so near to it that I blew it to atoms. Once I caught a\r\npoisonous serpent, called a _labarri_ snake, that I might look for,\r\nand examine the fangs, which contained its venom. I saw it asleep;\r\nand coming cautiously towards it, I sprang at its neck, which I\r\ngrasped tightly with my hands; its mouth was thus forced open; then\r\ntaking a small piece of stick, I pressed it on the fang, (the\r\npoint of which communicated with the root where the bag of poison is\r\nsituated,) and I distinctly saw the venom ooze out: it was of a thick\r\nsubstance and of a yellow color; of course I killed the creature.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Starboard in tree]\r\n\r\nOne day, during my wanderings in South America, I came unawares upon\r\na herd of wild horses that were grazing quietly on the borders of a\r\nforest. Well,—I had been walking a long way, and felt tired; so I\r\nthought I might as well try to catch one of these horses, and vary\r\nmy mode of journeying, by riding. I had read of the manner in which\r\nthe Guachos (or South American peasants) catch these animals with\r\na lasso, or long rope, which has a loop at the end of it; and this\r\nthey expertly throw over the head of the animal that they single out:\r\ntheir dexterity is surprising. I feared, however, to attempt such an\r\nexploit, lest I should fail, and thus frighten them all away: besides\r\nI had no rope that was long enough.\r\n\r\nSo I set my wits to work, and thus I tried my scheme. I observed\r\namong the trees that skirted the plain, a pool of water: to this pool\r\nI made my way; for, thought I, they will surely come there, by and\r\nby, to drink; so I climbed up into a cinchona, or barktree.\r\n\r\nHaving fastened one end of my rope tightly round one of the lower\r\nbranches, I made the other into a slip-knot or noose; and then I\r\nwaited patiently for my expected prey. At last the whole herd of\r\nhorses left their pasture in a body, and came neighing and gambling\r\ntowards the water, with their tails sailing in the wind, and their\r\nlong manes waving about with every graceful turn of their bodies. I\r\nassure you it was rather an appalling sight to see myself close over\r\nthe heads of so many powerful animals, that made the ground echo with\r\ntheir spirited movements.\r\n\r\nI sat still, however, enjoying myself with a calabash shell full of\r\nmilk, which I had drawn from a _cow-tree_ that grew on the rock near\r\nme.\r\n\r\n“A _cow-tree_, Mr. Starboard!” methinks I hear my young readers\r\nexclaim; “A cow-tree! Surely you mean a _cow grazing_, Mr. Starboard.\r\nWe know that travellers are privileged to tell pretty big stories,\r\nMr. Starboard; but there is such a thing, Mr. Starboard; as\r\noverstepping too far the bounds of truth, Mr. Starboard.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Starboard in tree]\r\n\r\nUpon my veracity, my dear young readers, I am in earnest. It was\r\na _cow-tree_, from which I drew the milk: and the great traveller,\r\nHumboldt, will prove what I have said.\r\n\r\nThe cow-tree is found on the most barren rocks, where rains rarely\r\nvisit it, and it has large woody roots. When its trunk is pierced, a\r\nmost delicious, white, thick juice exudes, (or flows out,) which is\r\nquite as pleasant and nourishing as the milk of our cows. The Indians\r\nalways make use of it, and it is found in the greatest abundance\r\nabout sunrise.\r\n\r\nWell: I had just finished my bowl of vegetable milk, when a fine\r\nfellow of a horse came under my cinchona-tree, and stooped to drink;\r\nso I crept to the end of the branch; and as he raised his head, I\r\nslipped the noose over his neck, and drew it tight; the start he gave\r\nwhen he found himself confined, frightened his companions, and away\r\nthey all scampered, leaving me and my prisoner alone.\r\n\r\nInstead of striving to break the rope and escape, which he might\r\nhave done with ease, his courage seemed weakened by this new kind of\r\nrestraint. I had some struggles, it is true; but I quickly conquered\r\nhim, and we were soon friends.\r\n\r\nI have met, in the course of my life with a variety of other\r\nadventures, which I will narrate to my young readers, if they will\r\ngive their attention. I am an old man now and have plenty of leisure;\r\nbut the greater portion of my life has been passed in unceasing\r\nactivity and has been full of incident:—\r\n\r\n    “Up to the north—the polar north,\r\n      With the whalers did I go,\r\n    ’Mong the mountains of eternal ice\r\n      To the land of the thawless snow.\r\n\r\n    “We were hemmed in by icy rocks,\r\n      The strength of man was vain;\r\n    But at once the arm of God was shown\r\n      The rocks were rent in twain.\r\n\r\n    “And then we sailed to the tropic seas,\r\n      That are like crystal clear,\r\n    Thou wilt marvel much, thou little child,\r\n      These glorious things to hear.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SHIPWRECK.\r\n\r\n  Doubling Cape Horn—A storm—Our Traveller Shipwrecked Taken\r\n  up—Earthquake—Escape to the shore—Adventures on shore—Journey to\r\n  Bonaventura—Safe Arrival.\r\n\r\n\r\nHere our friend Tom Starboard in his sailor style, gives an account\r\nof a remarkable shipwreck. But there is nothing better than to let\r\nhim tell the story himself. The account is natural, though it may be\r\na fiction.\r\n\r\n“We did not go through the Straits of Magellan, as the passage is\r\ndangerous; but we passed them and doubled Cape Horn. We went merrily\r\non, touching land, occasionally, to take in water, fruit, and live\r\nstock, now and then speaking a vessel, or finding some new kind of\r\nfish, or wonderful bird, till we neared the island of Juan Fernandez.\r\nHere the weather changed, and such a storm came down upon us as I\r\nnever saw before or since.\r\n\r\n“Before it reached its height, and while we were all in good spirits,\r\na gust of wind blew my hat off, when Ned, to make me laugh, called\r\nout, ‘Tom, your hair will be blown off too, if you don’t hold it on;\r\nmy shoestrings have been whisked out this half-hour.’\r\n\r\n“But the fury of the storm so increased, as to put all laughing and\r\njoking out of our thoughts. Night came on so rapidly that it seemed\r\nas if a mighty black cloud had fallen suddenly over us. The gallant\r\nvessel which had weathered so many storms, struck on a sunken rock,\r\nand went to pieces, as if she had been made of glass! I got entangled\r\nin some loose rigging, which had been snapped and unravelled like\r\ntwine, and this circumstance, which I expected would be the cause\r\nof my death, saved my life. Part of the topmast was attached to the\r\nropes which the furious blast twisted round me, as it swept off my\r\nshipmates in crowds, into the fierce waters: and away I went also, at\r\nthe same moment, with my brave captain!—I never more saw a soul from\r\nthe vessel, nor an atom of her stout planks.\r\n\r\n“How long I floated in my net work of ropes, I cannot tell. I\r\nremember the wrath of the panting billows, as they were urged onwards\r\nby the furious hurricane. On they dashed over my defenceless head,\r\nthrowing the shattered mast against my wounded limbs, and straining\r\nthe cords till they cut into my flesh. I remember, too, that the\r\nstorm seemed to subside as quickly as it had arisen. Then a noise\r\nas if a vessel toiling through the waves came over me, and a mixed\r\nfeeling of fear and hope passed through my confused brain;—then a\r\nshout and a grappling with my coiling ropes;—then a sensation of the\r\nsoft air, and of my mounting through it;—and then a buzz of voices,\r\nas I lay in quietness on a solid floor.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Person in rowboat]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Sailing ship]\r\n\r\n“Alas! how wretched I felt, when I found that all the voices were\r\nstrange, the language foreign, and the faces dark and unknown to\r\nme. A Portuguese merchant vessel, bound for the city and port of\r\nGuayaquil, had picked me up.\r\n\r\n“I cannot describe to you the forlorn state of my feelings, after the\r\nterrible wreck. My own situation, however, and the altered mode of my\r\nexistence, I did not consider till I was made to feel it severely, by\r\nthe coarse treatment I met with from those who saved my life. I was\r\nmade to work my way—that I expected, and could not complain of—but I\r\nfelt sadly the difference in the manners of the captain and his crew,\r\ncompared with those of the “Speedwell.”\r\n\r\n“I thanked the captain for saving my life, and told him I intended\r\nto leave the ship. This, to my surprise, he said I should not do. I\r\nreplied that he had no control over me; that I was an Englishman, and\r\ncould not be compelled to serve in a foreign vessel. Then, said he,\r\npay me for your passage from Juan Fernandez, and you may leave the\r\nship. I told him this was impossible, as I had lost every thing in\r\nthe fatal wreck. At this he only laughed in my face, and said; ‘That\r\nis not my look out; you shall pay me or stay where you are;’ and with\r\nan oath, turned on his heel, and left me to my own sad feelings.”\r\n\r\nTom determined, at once, to embrace the first opportunity to escape.\r\nBut they had dropped anchor two or three miles from the shore, and\r\nhow could he effect it? Besides he was closely watched. But the\r\nvessel was soon to sail on a long voyage, and being called to take\r\nhis turn, one night in the watch, with two or three others, he\r\ndetermined to make the attempt.\r\n\r\n“This night, or never—said I to myself, as I took my station. While\r\nI was walking the deck, one of my shipmates at the mast-head, and\r\nthe other astern, the ship suddenly quivered, as if she were in an\r\nague fit!—down slipped the fellow from on high, and fell flat on his\r\nface; the other rushed forward, and kneeled beside him, both crossing\r\nthemselves and saying prayers to their saints. I lost no time, but\r\nseizing a board, I hastily lashed it to my back with a rope (that\r\nwhen I became fatigued with swimming, I might turn and float,) and\r\nslipping astern, let myself down into the water. The noise of the\r\nsplash I feared would betray me, and I gave up all for lost, though\r\nthe next minute, I found they were all praying, and took courage and\r\nquietly struck off. I made but little headway, however, owing to the\r\nboard on my back.\r\n\r\n“As I continued my toilsome passage towards the shore, I heard the\r\nloud bellowing of the troubled earth, and felt the water jar me, as\r\nif it had been a solid substance. Suddenly a towering volcano, which\r\nI took to be Cotopaxi, at above one hundred miles distance, appeared\r\nilluminated like an immense light-house; the thundering increased,\r\nand shrieks and other fearful noises were borne to me over the water.\r\nAt last, when nearly exhausted, I was thrown ashore, where I lay\r\nto recover breath and strength, but oh, the distress and confusion\r\nthat then took place! Many of the inhabitants came crowding down to\r\nthe water’s edge, for safety; houses had been destroyed; the earth\r\nwas rocking and heaving like an angry ocean; streams of water had\r\ngushed out of the ground where no water had ever been seen before;\r\nsuffocating fumes of sulphur burst up under the feet of the terrified\r\nand flying sufferers; and when the morning dawned, the face of\r\nthe country seemed changed. Still the town itself (Guayaquil) had\r\nsustained but little damage, and the inhabitants began to return to\r\ntheir dwellings and their business. They are so much accustomed to\r\nearthquakes all over Peru, that it is not surprising they should so\r\nsoon lose their terrors.\r\n\r\n“In the general distress, I met with but little compassion or\r\nassistance, which I then thought strange, but I had not yet learned\r\nthat affliction often hardens the heart. No one relieved my hunger;\r\nso I ventured to steal a handful of nuts from a heap that had fallen\r\nout of a basket which had been thrown down during the night. These I\r\nbeat between two stones, and mixed with a little water; and this was\r\nmy food for that day.\r\n\r\n“As I wandered about among the shipping, looking in vain for a vessel\r\nbound to Europe, I recollected that the bay of Guayaquil is famous\r\nfor a small shell fish, about the size of a nut. It is called\r\n_turbine_, and produces a purple dye, reckoned the best in the world.\r\nSo I boldly seized a small boat that was lying at anchor, and pushing\r\nout into the bay, I caught a few of these valuable little fish, and\r\nreturned to shore again, before the owner of the boat had missed it.\r\nI was now sure of a resource against starving, provided any one would\r\nbuy my turbines. I was soon fortunate enough to find a purchaser, so\r\nI pursued the plan for several days, always taking the same boat,\r\nwhich no one appeared to claim. Perhaps the owner, poor fellow, had\r\nbeen destroyed by the earthquake.\r\n\r\n“I slept every night in a hut close to the sea; and on the\r\nfifth morning, I found a French vessel in the harbor, which was\r\nproceeding on her voyage to Bonaventura and to Acapulco, in Mexico.\r\nI immediately went to the captain, and offered to work my way to\r\nthe port of Bonaventura, if he would give me my passage. And after\r\ntelling him my story, he kindly granted my request; and in due time\r\nwe reached the port, where with feelings of very great gratitude to\r\nthe captain, I left the vessel.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJOURNEY ACROSS THE ANDES.\r\n\r\n  Tom Arms and Equips for his Journey—His Mule—Sliding down the\r\n  Mountains—Mule Escapes—Singular Bridges—How he subsisted—Diamonds\r\n  and Gold.\r\n\r\n\r\nI had formed the strange resolution of crossing over the continent\r\nof South America alone, and on foot! I had read Humbolt’s _Personal\r\nNarrative_, and I longed to see the wonders which he speaks of. Some\r\nexcuse may be made for me perhaps, when it is considered that I had a\r\nnatural fondness for a wandering life and for the wonders of nature;\r\nbesides, I could meet with no ship on this western side of the\r\ncontinent, bound for my native country. The French captain, with whom\r\nI came from Guayaquil, thought me a little deranged; still I believe\r\nthe good man was glad to get rid of me. He gave me thirty francs; a\r\ngun, and some gunpowder, saying with a shrug of his shoulder, as he\r\nbade me farewell, “You are very courageous; but remember you must\r\neat; and this gun will be of great use to you.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Mule and rider]\r\n\r\nI provided myself with a wallet, in which to put my shoes, stockings,\r\ngloves and a shirt; then inquiring the road to Zita, I set out\r\nbefore sunrise, towards the Andes. I was five months in crossing\r\nthe desolate northern extremities of those giants of the earth.\r\nI bought—nay, I did not buy, I found a mule that was browsing on\r\nsome prickly shrub, (I forget its name,) in a wild pass of the\r\nmountains. She was saddled and bridled, and had evidently lost her\r\nmaster. I looked in vain for some hours, but could find no trace\r\nof any traveller, so I felt justified in taking possession of her;\r\nand it was well I did, for the sure-footed beast took me safely\r\nover dangerous passes that I never could have crossed without her\r\nassistance. Many times has the creature, with a sagacity that was\r\nastonishing, stood on the summit of a peak like a sugar loaf, looking\r\nfrom side to side; then slowly taking aim, has slid down with me on\r\nher back, for thirty, forty, or fifty feet![1]\r\n\r\nOne night, however, she played truant, and slipped her bridle, which\r\nI always wound round my arm while I slept, and disappeared, leaving\r\nme on the borders of a trackless forest.\r\n\r\nAt one time, I crossed a mighty torrent that was boiling along, at\r\nthe depth of a hundred feet below me, through, a narrow ravine;—and\r\nwhat sort of a bridge do you think I ventured upon? Two large\r\nfragments of rocks, one from each side, had fallen together, as I\r\nsupposed, during some earthquake, and had formed a natural bridge,\r\nquite firm and safe over which I crossed.\r\n\r\nAnother time I passed a chasm of prodigious depth, near an ancient\r\nvillage, the ingenious inhabitants of which had constructed a bridge\r\nof rushes, in the following manner. Two strong posts were fixed in\r\nthe rock on each side, and to these were fastened ropes of rushes;\r\nthe path upon them being made of the same material, platted together.\r\nOn each side was also a rope for the passenger to steady himself by.\r\n\r\nThese bridges, in fact, are the origin of our chain or suspension\r\nbridges, but the elastic and light nature of the rushes makes the\r\nmotion of the bridge very unpleasant. Indeed when I had one day gone\r\nabout half way across one of them, my head began to swim, and I was\r\nobliged to sit down to recover myself; for I really thought I should\r\nnever reach the opposite side. I sat there for some time, swinging in\r\na most perilous yet ridiculous situation I assure you.\r\n\r\nI wished much to see the interior of one of the mines, but they were\r\ntoo far off. The quicksilver mines of Huancavelica is particularly\r\ncurious, having a complete town and its cathedral deep in the bowels\r\nof the earth.\r\n\r\nI shall not attempt to tell you half the dangers, difficulties, and\r\ntroubles I have met with. I made the sun my guide by day, and the\r\nstars by night. I roosted in trees, like the birds, and ate fruit\r\nand herbs like the beast. I explored mountain torrents, which no\r\nhuman beings, probably, had never seen before; found diamonds in\r\ntheir beds, which had been dried up; collected gold from the mud of\r\nthe rivers, and a great many curiosities, which I was obliged to\r\nthrow away, for want of convenience to carry them. I met with tribes\r\nof Indians who had never heard of the name of England, or seen an\r\nEnglishman.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] This part of the story may seem a little unnatural, but many\r\ntravellers make similar statements.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVISIT TO A CAVERN.\r\n\r\n  Visit to a Cavern—The Guacharos—Night sounds—Return—An alarm—My\r\n  escape—Thanks for deliverance.\r\n\r\n\r\nOne evening, during my journey, having refreshed myself with some of\r\nthe fruit that grew near me—for I always found food enough in South\r\nAmerica, even in the forests—I took a fancy to explore a cavern that\r\nI saw in the rock, near which a cascade tumbled. Resolving to be well\r\nprepared for any enemy I might meet with, I took my gun with me.\r\n\r\nI ought to tell you, by the way, that after I lost my mule, I was\r\nobliged for some time to content myself with a horse. I left him\r\ngrazing at the foot of a bark tree. You have heard of the Peruvian\r\nbark, which is used so much in medicine, I dare say. I tied my horse,\r\nthen, to a tree, which produces this sort of bark.\r\n\r\nWell, all things prepared, I set out on my expedition. As I drew\r\nnear the lofty cavern, I was astonished at the deafening noise\r\nof innumerable wings, and looking up in the uncertain twilight, I\r\nsaw hundreds—I think I might say thousands—of birds flying about,\r\npreparing to leave their home, in search of food. They were the\r\n_guacharos_. I had read of them in Humboldt’s narrative, but to use\r\nthe sailor phrase, I had never before ‘run foul’ of any of them. They\r\nare night birds, that somewhat resemble our owls, but instead of\r\nroosting on trees, these creatures build in caverns. A sight of them\r\nis well worth the trouble and danger of exploring one of these dark\r\nand gloomy mansions. Their noise is prodigious!\r\n\r\nIn fact, one of the most wonderful things a traveller meets with in\r\nSouth America, is the different and strange sounds at night. The\r\nhowling monkeys, the night-birds, the sharp cries of the jaguars, the\r\nroar of the pumas, the flapping of wings, the rustling of branches,\r\nand other noises, are astonishing!\r\n\r\nHow different from the lone solitude of our woods in New England,\r\nwhere the only sound, perhaps, that disturbs the silence of the\r\nnight, is the distant hooting of the owl, or the howling of some dog.\r\nIndeed, the greater part of the time, every creature is so silent\r\nthat you would scarcely know that any living thing was waking.\r\n\r\nWell, I stayed so long in the bird cavern, that it was quite dark\r\nwhen I got back to my horse, and I had not yet made up my nightly\r\nfire. So I groped round in the dark and collected, as well as I\r\ncould, some leaves and sticks, and began to kindle my fire. But just\r\nas I was kneeling down to blow at the heap of fuel I had lighted, my\r\nhorse suddenly started, drew back to the full length of his cord,\r\nrolled his eyes, enlarged his nostrils, threw his ears forward,\r\nerected his main and tail, and stood there the very picture of\r\nterror. “There is danger now,” thought I; but I was resolved to meet\r\nit. So I jumped up instantly, and looking into the gloom, in the\r\ndirection which my horse’s eyes took, I saw a dark mass of something\r\nmoving slowly along among the bushes.\r\n\r\nI was up the tree instantly, I assure you, taking with me my gun,\r\nwhich I had rested against its trunk. For a minute or two all was\r\nquiet. Soon, however, the dark body approached a little nearer, but\r\nso quietly, that I should have thought very little more of it, had\r\nnot my horse shown symptoms of so much alarm. I levelled my piece and\r\nfired, and, as I suppose, wounded the animal; for he bounded up, and\r\ndarted off into the thicket.\r\n\r\nJust at this moment the fire burst into a bright blaze, which kept\r\nthe wild animals away for the rest of that night. I did not rest or\r\nsleep very well, however, for I had used the rope that I commonly\r\ntied myself with, to fasten my horse. One thing, however, you may\r\neasily suppose, I did not forget to do; which was to give thanks to\r\nmy great Preserver, who ‘_guides the helm_’, as we sailors say, by\r\nland, as well as by sea.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTRAVELS AMONG THE INDIANS.\r\n\r\nThe Steppes—New troubles—Bad water—Eating clay and ants.\r\n\r\n\r\nI came at last to the dreary plains of South America, called\r\n_Steppes_, and here my troubles were unusually severe. All kinds\r\nof stinging insects, serpents, and loathesome reptiles annoyed me;\r\nbesides I could hardly get food and drink. Sometimes, though rarely,\r\nI was so fortunate as to find a plant resembling the aloe, containing\r\na quantity of pure water in its stem; but when I could not get this,\r\nI was obliged to drink the horrible water of the rivers, swarming\r\nwith animalculæ (little creatures almost too small to be seen by\r\nthe naked eye) to such a degree that I seemed to swallow about as\r\nmuch solid matter as liquid. As to food, I was contented, often, to\r\nswallow little balls of earth, as the natives do; for though it would\r\nbe disgusting now, it served then, to keep the breath of life in me.\r\nIt is a very fat, buttery kind of earth, and is prepared for food by\r\nbaking it slightly in the fire. You are aware, I suppose, that the\r\nnatives of Japan, Siberia, Africa, and other parts of the world, also\r\nsometimes eat clay.\r\n\r\nAfter travelling a long time, I came unexpectedly upon a wandering\r\ntribe of Indians, consisting of only three or four families; and,\r\nentering one of their wretched huts, built of clay and leaves, I\r\nasked them for food.\r\n\r\nAt first they did not understand me, but with the help of signs, I\r\nsoon made them comprehend that I was hungry; upon which one of them\r\ntook down a bag containing a kind of greasy, spotted, whitish paste,\r\ngave me some of it, pointed to the fire, and went and lay down in his\r\nhammock, which with fourteen others was slung from some beams above.\r\n\r\nI was so tired and wet, for it was now the rainy season, and so glad\r\nto find something to eat better than clay, that I was going to cram\r\nit down, when I saw unexpectedly that the black spots on it were\r\nlarge ants. I threw it down instantly; but soon recollecting that a\r\n_paste_ mixed with ants, is represented by Humboldt as a very common\r\nfood among some of these tribes of Indians, and feeling impelled by\r\nhunger to eat something, I at last eat a small quantity of it.\r\n\r\nThese were the laziest sort of people I ever met with. They seemed\r\nto have no wants, beyond mere eating and drinking;[2] they have no\r\nclothes to mend, or domestic cares to attend to; no fishing, no\r\nhunting to prepare for.\r\n\r\nI quitted them as soon as I could, I assure you, for they were almost\r\ntoo lazy to furnish me with food; besides, I was not without fears,\r\nfrom the accounts given by other travellers, that they would master\r\nenergy enough to kill me for food, as a treat!\r\n\r\nBefore I left them, however, I was greatly rejoiced, one day, to hear\r\nthe word “Orinoco;” for, on inquiry, I found by signs that this long\r\nwished for river was only a little way to the south.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Eel]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[2] I know we have _some_ just such people as this in every country,\r\nat least in every one that I have seen; but here they were _all_\r\nstupid. There were no active and industrious persons among them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBIRDS AND BEASTS OF SOUTH AMERICA.\r\n\r\n  Bathing—A shock—Electrical Eel—The Bell-bird—The Sloth—how\r\n  slandered.\r\n\r\n\r\nOne day, about noon, as I came to a pleasant looking pond or lake,\r\nbeautifully over-shadowed with trees, the thought struck me that I\r\nwould take a bath. But I had scarcely entered the water, before I\r\nfelt a shock like that of an electrical machine, and a very severe\r\none, too.\r\n\r\n“An earthquake?” you will perhaps say. By no means. The shock was\r\ngiven by an electrical eel. However, it instantly took away all my\r\nstrength, and nearly all my senses, too; and I believe, in my heart,\r\nI should never have been here, but for help. It was close to a\r\nMissionary village, and an Indian woman happening to come down to the\r\npond to dip up water, just at that moment, and guessing my situation,\r\nlost no time in dragging me out before the animal had an opportunity\r\nof repeating his shocks.\r\n\r\nI had now reached a better country. The mornings, especially, were\r\nuncommonly beautiful. Birds of every color greeted my ears with their\r\nsongs; and among the rest, I particularly noticed the _companion_ or\r\n_bell-bird_. Perched on the top of a lofty mora tree, this bird used\r\nto awaken me by his clear ringing note that sounds exactly like a\r\nfine toned bell, and may be heard two or three miles. He is white,\r\nwith a black spire on his head, and about three inches in length.\r\n\r\nAmong other creatures that arrested my attention, was the harmless,\r\nbut misrepresented and slandered _sloth_. I used often to see him\r\nlooking down in my face from the lofty trees, where he feels most at\r\nhome and most happy.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Sloth]\r\n\r\nIt is true that after he has been caught and put on the ground, he is\r\na dull lazy animal; for he is out of his element, almost as much as a\r\nfish out of water, or a human being in it.\r\n\r\nBut I will give you a few more particulars of this animal. He is\r\nformed to live on trees, and is never found any where else, unless by\r\nforce or accident. While the weather is calm, he remains suspended or\r\nhanging from the branches; but during a high wind, when the boughs\r\nof the closely growing trees are shaken and _laced together_, as\r\nit were, he passes from one to the other with ease and quickness.\r\nHe never moves _upon_, but _under_ the branches; he hangs there to\r\nrest, to eat, and to sleep. The color of his fur is so nearly that\r\nof the moss on the bark, that it is not easy to discover him, except\r\nwhen he is moving. In short, instead of being an object of disgust,\r\nor even of pity, I do not know a creature that appears more happy,\r\nas long as man and other animals will let him alone. It is man, by\r\nhis “meddling” that makes a great many of the woes that his fellow\r\nanimals feel. It is guns and snares, and traps, and aviaries, and\r\ncages, that make birds and beasts most unhappy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE WILL-O’-THE-WISP.\r\n\r\n  India rubber shoes—Aloe-leaf hats—Will-o’-the-wisps—What they are.\r\n\r\n\r\nI had now been so long or in the forests and among the Indians, that\r\nI began to be in want of some of those things that are only to be\r\nfound in the abodes of civilized men. My shoes, in particular, began\r\nto fail me; and I dreaded the idea of going barefooted day after day.\r\n\r\nBut as good luck would have it, or rather, perhaps I ought to say,\r\nas a kind Providence _designed_ it, I fell in with an India rubber\r\ntree, into which somebody had made incisions, and from which the gum\r\nwas now flowing. So I let it flow upon my shoes, in order to form a\r\nnew sole. In this undertaking, however, I was not quite so successful\r\nas in making a new hat to supply the place of my old one. I found a\r\nspecies of aloe, from the tough thick leaves of which, by splitting\r\nthem I made me a very good hat, especially for the dry season. In the\r\nrainy season, it would not have been quite so comfortable, I suppose.\r\n\r\nOne night, as I had taken up my quarters on the verge of a forest,\r\nand had got seated in my cradle, which you know was among the thick\r\nbranches of some huge tree, I saw a light glancing among the trees.\r\nI came down from my roosting place, almost in an instant, and went\r\ntowards it, hoping there was a village near; for I was sadly in want\r\nof a better rope to fasten myself with; and the Indians of these\r\nvillages make some very ingenious ones, by twisting together the long\r\nfibres of the leaves of the cocoa-tree.\r\n\r\nWell, as I said, I followed the light, but _where_, do you think?\r\nWhy out of the forest, to be sure, but into something worse than a\r\nforest. I found myself, ere I was aware of the nature of my guide, up\r\nto my knees in a quagmire: and what was more mortifying still, I was\r\nnot much nearer the light than when I set out.\r\n\r\nI began now to suspect what it was. It was evidently one of\r\nthose things to which they give the name of _ignis fatuus_, or\r\n_will-o’-the-wisp_. They are seen, as you know, (and as I might have\r\nknown had my wits been about me) in low swampy places, peeping and\r\ndodging about. They are supposed to be _gaseous_; but perhaps you do\r\nnot all of you know what _gaseous_ means; and I am hardly philosopher\r\nor chemist enough to tell you.\r\n\r\nThe atmosphere or air which we breathe is composed of two\r\ningredients, or _gases_, as the chemists call them. One is oxygen.\r\nThis is the supporter of life and flame, for if it could be taken\r\nout of the air we could not breathe again, and every candle and lamp\r\nwould be extinguished in a moment. The other is nitrogen or azote,\r\nwhich _destroys_ life.\r\n\r\nI told you the air we breathe was made up of these two airs or gases;\r\nand it is. But many other gases sometimes float in it. One of these\r\nis hydrogen. It is produced in various ways, and is one of the most\r\ninflammable substances in the world. Now electricity, (or lightning,\r\nfor it is the same thing) which is a subtle or penetrating fluid,\r\nalways exists in the atmosphere, and has at all times power to ignite\r\n(set on fire) a vapor so inflammable as hydrogen, if it happens to\r\ncome in contact with it. Now, again, as this hydrogen gas is most\r\nreadily produced by the decomposition of water, and combines or\r\nmixes with various other matters arising from decaying vegetation,\r\nputrifying animal substances, in low and marshy swamps, a tiny spark\r\nis sufficient to ignite these combined gases, and thus set off the\r\nWill-o’-the-Wisps.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE AEROLITES.\r\n\r\n  Stones falling—Where they come from—Arrival at the river Orinoco.\r\n\r\n\r\nWell, I extricated myself from the quagmire and returned,—though not\r\nwithout some difficulty, I had wandered so far, to my roosting place.\r\nThe next morning as I was preparing to descend the tree, the sky\r\nbeing clear, and the sun shining, I was alarmed by a hissing noise\r\nin the air; and looking quickly around, I was just in time to see an\r\nimmense mass of something, I could not tell what, falling from above,\r\nwith a loud noise, and crushing in its fall, the branches of a lofty\r\ntamarind tree.\r\n\r\nHastening to the spot, I found, to my surprise, an enormous piece of\r\nmetal, quite hot, which had fallen with such force that it lay half\r\nburied in the swampy ground.\r\n\r\nI stood lost in wonder. When I was a boy, I had often picked up lumps\r\nof metal on the Wiltshire Downs, in England, but though told they\r\nwere aerolites, I did not at that time believe a word of it. “Can the\r\nthin pure air,” thought I then, “form such hard bodies? Or can there\r\nbe great iron mountains, and forges, and blacksmiths, and every thing\r\nof that sort, up in the air?”\r\n\r\nBut now a huge mass lay at my feet. I had seen it fall. It was still\r\nhot. The boughs of the tamarind tree lay scattered about in every\r\ndirection. How could I doubt any longer? Was it reasonable to deny\r\nfacts, before my eyes, because I could not account for them?\r\n\r\nDo you wish to know if I can account for them _now_? Not a whit\r\nbetter. The moon, some say, has volcanic mountains which throw them\r\nout. But I don’t believe it. Think what an immense force of pressure\r\nit must take to send up a huge stone from one of our volcanoes, quite\r\nbeyond the sphere of the earth’s attraction, so as to be met by the\r\nattraction of the moon and be carried to it! Do you believe such a\r\nthing could ever happen?\r\n\r\nNearly all we know about it is briefly this. Heavy bodies, of\r\nevery variety of size, from an ounce to 300 pound’s weight, have\r\nat different times fallen from the atmosphere. These heavy bodies\r\nare really composed of earth and metals. They all contain the same\r\nsubstances, though sometimes varying a little in the proportions;\r\nviz. iron, nickel, manganese, silica or silex, sulphur, magnesia and\r\nlime.\r\n\r\nPerhaps I ought to add that though I _know_ nothing more about\r\nthese wonderful phenomena, it is more generally believed that these\r\nsubstances are _formed_ in the vast regions of the _atmosphere_, by\r\ncauses unknown except to Him who _created_ the atmosphere, “in whom\r\nwe live, and move, and have our being.”\r\n\r\nSoon after my last adventure I arrived at the Mission villages on the\r\nbanks of the river Orinoco. Here I met with a Spanish gentleman of\r\ndistinction, by the name of Don Calao. He was a merchant, and sold\r\nmonkeys, mackaws, turtles’ eggs, &c., very odd things for a man to\r\ntrade with, as I then thought. I have something to say about turtles’\r\neggs in my next letter.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Turtle]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE HARVEST OF TURTLE’S EGGS.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou would wonder how there could be any turtles remaining in South\r\nAmerica, if you were to see the thousands and thousands that are\r\ndestroyed by the Indians every year, at the _Harvest of Eggs_, as\r\nthey call it. I attended one of these hunts or harvests, one day,\r\nwith Don Calao the merchant, and saw the whole process.\r\n\r\nWe all went in a boat, early one morning, to an Island in the river,\r\nwhere the sand was smooth, and which the tide had left bare. A person\r\nthen took a long pole, and walked about, thrusting it into the sand,\r\nin every direction, and wherever it penetrated easily, he knew there\r\nwas a nest of turtle’s eggs. So then they dug down, and when they\r\nfound any, they put them in a basket which they brought for the\r\npurpose.\r\n\r\nNumbers of Indians were there, from all the neighboring shores, and\r\nimmense numbers of eggs were collected. They make a kind of oil of\r\nthe yolk, which is used in cooking, as well as for burning in their\r\nhouses.\r\n\r\nIt is supposed that not fewer than a million of turtles lay their\r\neggs at the mouth of the great river Orinoco. More than three\r\nmillions of eggs were taken the year I was there. Each turtle lays,\r\non an average, seventy eggs. You may be surprised that out of seventy\r\nmillions of eggs laid, only three millions were taken. But so many\r\nare broken, so many hunted out and devoured by the jaguars and other\r\nanimals that feed upon them, that the wonder is, rather, that we find\r\nthe vast number that we do. Many escape and are hatched however, for\r\nI saw in one instance, the whole shore of the Orinoco, swarming with\r\nlittle turtles, just hatched, and scrambling towards the water to\r\nescape from the Indian children who were catching them.\r\n\r\nThe turtles lay their eggs during the night, in large holes, which\r\nthey scratch in the sand. They then cover them up, and leave them to\r\nbe warmed into life by the sun. The eggs are larger than pigeons’\r\neggs, and when well preserved, by slightly boiling or by drying in\r\nthe sun, are very pleasant food.\r\n\r\nWe saw some large shells of turtles which the jaguars had emptied as\r\nneatly as if the flesh had been cut away with a sharp knife. Those\r\nanimals hunt the poor creatures, catch them, turn them on their\r\nbacks—you know they cannot turn back again—and then devour them at\r\ntheir leisure.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Jaguar]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ANIMALS.\r\n\r\n[Animals of South America—Jaguar—Water Hog.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe same day that we went to the egg harvest, as we were sailing\r\nalong on the river, we saw a jaguar feasting on a chiquire or water\r\nhog, and a large flock of vultures hovering round him, as if they\r\ngrudged him every mouthful he swallowed. Finally they troubled him so\r\nmuch, that he took up his prey and carried it off into the adjacent\r\nforest.\r\n\r\nBut I found creatures in South America, more terrible than serpents,\r\njaguars, or crocodiles. You will wonder, perhaps, what they could be.\r\nThen I’ll tell you. They were musquetoes, white flies, and ants.\r\n\r\nMusquetoes are indeed troublesome every where; but nowhere that I\r\nhave been—and I have been in all parts of the world—so much so as in\r\nSouth America. Why, we seemed to breathe them, almost, instead of\r\nair. We were never free from them except at midnight; and then other\r\ninsects, huge bats, and jaguars, kept us in continual alarm.\r\n\r\nSleeping rooms there, are sometimes built on poles, or scaffolding,\r\nhigher than these cruel insects ever fly, which is found to be about\r\ntwelve feet from the level of the rivers; and in these apartments\r\nwe were able to obtain a little breathing comfort. Vast regions of\r\nthe country are rendered uninhabitable by the different species of\r\ntormenting animals which infest it. When two persons meet in the\r\nmorning, the first question often is, “How are you to-day for the\r\nmusquetoes?” I have had both my legs swelled to a most enormous size,\r\nby the bites of these animals.\r\n\r\nIn some parts of the country the Indians bury themselves, all but\r\ntheir heads, in the sand while they sleep; in others, they assemble\r\nall the cows in the village, and pass their nights among them, for\r\nit is found that they are not so troublesome in the neighborhood of\r\ncattle.\r\n\r\nSometimes they build a kind of oven, without doors or windows, having\r\nonly a little hole, through which they creep on their hands and\r\nknees. They then light a fire in it of wet brushwood, which makes a\r\ngreat smoke and drives off the insects; then closing the door of the\r\noven, they go to sleep. But I could not endure the smoke as well as I\r\ncould the musquetoes.\r\n\r\nAs to the _white flies_, they are so very small, that if you were to\r\nuse musquetoe curtains, they would have to be wetted to prevent these\r\ntiny creatures from making their way through the threads. Their sting\r\nis exceedingly painful.\r\n\r\nThe _termites_ are a sort of ant that eats paper, pasteboard,\r\nparchment, &c, so that there are no ancient records of the countries\r\nin which they are found. But there is another species of ant which\r\ndevours juicy green leaves, such as salads; so that when the\r\ninhabitants wish for a few dishes of pleasant cooling herbs, they\r\nmake a garden _in the air_.\r\n\r\nYou will smile, but I assure you that I state nothing but what I have\r\nseen. They procure an old boat, or some frame of that description,\r\nraise it on dry poles, then fill it with earth, and sow their seeds.\r\nThe destructive ants, travelling as they do in bands, not knowing\r\nthere is any thing growing above, pass by these bare poles or\r\nsupporters, and the plants are saved.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Person sitting under tree]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBEAUTIFUL ANIMALS.\r\n\r\n  Some beautiful animals in South America—The Titi Monkey The Widow\r\n  Monkey—End of the Journey.\r\n\r\n\r\nBy this time I fear you will begin to think that there is nothing\r\nto be found in all South America, but dangerous passes, savage men,\r\nferocious beasts, venomous serpents and reptiles, and troublesome\r\ninsects. But you are mistaken. Humboldt would tell you so.\r\nWoodbridge, too, in his geography says that “the finest fruits, the\r\nmost beautiful vegetables, and the largest and loftiest trees, are\r\nfound in the Torrid Zone,” and much of South America lies, you know,\r\nin this zone. He says also,—and he says right,—that it produces not\r\nonly the fiercest and most dangerous animals, and the largest and\r\nmost venomous serpents and insects, but _some_ animals which are\r\namong the “most beautiful” in the world.\r\n\r\nI think one or two of the monkey race which I saw, are among the\r\nmost beautiful of the animal kingdom. One species, called the Titi,\r\npleased me particularly. It is very small; its hair is of a beautiful\r\ngolden color; and it is a more striking resemblance to a child than\r\nany thing I ever saw in my life. It is also very timid, and when any\r\nbody alarms it, its large eyes fill with tears.[3]\r\n\r\nThe Titis are very fond of insects, particularly of spiders. It is\r\nsaid—but I cannot vouch for the truth of it—that when an engraving\r\nof an insect on which it feeds has been shone it, it would dart out\r\nits paw in hopes of catching it; but that when pictures of those on\r\nwhich it does not feed are presented, it takes no notice of them.\r\n\r\nThe Titi Monkey is also very fond of warmth. If several of them\r\nare confined in a cage, and a cooling shower comes on, they crowd\r\ntogether, and twine their legs and tails round one another, to keep\r\nthemselves warm! One that was tamed used to run after a person that\r\nwore large sleeves to get into them! The Indians say that they\r\nsometimes meet groups of ten or twelve of them in the forests, crying\r\nterribly, because those on the outside want to get in the middle to\r\nbe warmer.\r\n\r\nThere is another beautiful animal of the same race called the _Widow\r\nMonkey_. Its hair is black, soft, and glossy; its face is of a\r\nwhitish color; the neck has a band in front, about an inch broad, the\r\nhinder feet are black, and the fore feet white. In these white marks\r\non the black monkey, the inhabitants imagine they discover the veil,\r\nthe handkerchief, and the gloves of a _widow in mourning_.\r\n\r\nBut perhaps you are tired of my stories, and wish to come to the end\r\nof my journey. Well the rest is quickly told. Don Calao, the Spanish\r\ngentleman, very kindly assisted me in getting down the river, to the\r\nIsland of St. Thome, near its mouth, where I was so fortunate as to\r\nmeet with a merchant vessel bound to my native country. I procured a\r\npassage, and after a long and rather boisterous voyage, reached home\r\nin safety.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE END.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[3] This is very remarkable, if true.
