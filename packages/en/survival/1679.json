THE CALL OF SPRING\r\n\r\n“Well, after all, the country isn't such a bad place as some city folk\r\nthink.”\r\n\r\nThe young fellow who said this stood upon the highest point of the Ridge\r\nRoad, where the land sloped abruptly to the valley in which lay the\r\nsmall municipality of Crawberry on the one hand, while on the other open\r\nfields and patches of woodland, in a huge green-and-brown checkerboard\r\npattern, fell more easily to the bank of the distant river.\r\n\r\nDotted here and there about the farming country lying before the youth\r\nas he looked westward were cottages, or the more important-looking\r\nhomesteads on the larger farms; and in the distance a white church spire\r\nbehind the trees marked the tiny settlement of Blaine's Smithy.\r\n\r\nA Sabbath calm lay over the fields and woods. It was mid-afternoon of\r\nan early February Sunday--the time of the mid-winter thaw, that false\r\nprophet of the real springtime.\r\n\r\nAlthough not a furrow had been turned as yet in the fields, and the snow\r\nlay deep in some fence corners and beneath the hedges, there was, after\r\nall, a smell of fresh earth--a clean, live smell--that Hiram Strong had\r\nmissed all week down in Crawberry.\r\n\r\n“I'm glad I came up here,” he muttered, drawing in great breaths of\r\nthe clean air. “Just to look at the open fields, without any brick and\r\nmortar around, makes a fellow feel fine!”\r\n\r\nHe stretched his arms above his head and, standing alone there on the\r\nupland, felt bigger and better than he had in weeks.\r\n\r\nFor Hiram Strong was a country boy, born and bred, and the town stifled\r\nhim. Besides, he had begun to see that his two years in Crawberry had\r\nbeen wasted.\r\n\r\n“As a hustler after fortune in the city I am not a howling success,”\r\n mused Hiram. “Somehow, I'm cramped down yonder,” and he glanced back\r\nat the squalid brick houses below him, the smoky roofs, and the ugly\r\nfactory chimneys.\r\n\r\n“And I declare,” he pursued, reflectively, “I don't believe I can stand\r\nOld Dan Dwight much longer. Dan, Junior, is bad enough--when he is\r\naround the store; but the boss would drive a fellow to death.”\r\n\r\nHe shook his head, now turning from the pleasanter prospect of the\r\nfarming land and staring down into the town.\r\n\r\n“Maybe I'm not a success because I don't stick to one thing. I've had\r\nsix jobs in less'n two years. That's a bad record for a boy, I believe.\r\nBut there hasn't any of them suited me, nor have I suited them.\r\n\r\n“And Dwight's Emporium beats 'em all!” finished Hiram, shaking his head.\r\n\r\nHe turned his back upon the town once more, as though to wipe his\r\nfailure out of his memory. Before him sloped a field of wheat and\r\nclover.\r\n\r\nIt had kept as green under the snow as though winter was an unknown\r\nseason. Every cloverleaf sparkled and the leaves of wheat bristled like\r\ntiny spears.\r\n\r\nSpring was on the way. He could hear the call of it!\r\n\r\nTwo years before Hiram had left the farm. He had no immediate relatives\r\nafter his father died. The latter had been a tenant-farmer only, and\r\nwhen his tools and stock and the few household chattels had been sold\r\nto pay the debts that had accumulated during his last illness, there was\r\nvery little money left for Hiram.\r\n\r\nThere was nobody to say him nay when he packed his bag and started for\r\nCrawberry, which was the metropolis of his part of the country. He had\r\nset out boldly, believing that he could get ahead faster, and become\r\nmaster of his own fortune more quickly in town than in the locality\r\nwhere he was born.\r\n\r\nHe was a rugged, well-set-up youth of seventeen, not over-tall, but\r\nsturdy and able to do a man's work. Indeed, he had long done a man's\r\nwork before he left the farm.\r\n\r\nHiram's hands were calloused, he shuffled a bit when walked, and his\r\nshoulders were just a little bowed from holding the plow handles since\r\nhe had been big enough to bridle his father's old mare.\r\n\r\nYes, the work on the farm had been hard--especially for a growing boy.\r\nMany farm boys work under better conditions than Hiram had.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, after a two years' trial of what the city has in store for\r\nmost country boys who cut loose from their old environment, Hiram Strong\r\nfelt to-day as though he must get back to the land.\r\n\r\n“There's nothing for me in town. Clerking in Dwight's Emporium will\r\nnever get me anywhere,” he thought, turning finally away from the open\r\ncountry and starting down the steep hill.\r\n\r\n“Why, there are college boys working on our street cars here--waiting\r\nfor some better job to turn up. What chance does a fellow stand who's\r\nonly got a country school education?\r\n\r\n“And there isn't any clean fun for a fellow in Crawberry--fun that\r\ndoesn't cost money. And goodness knows I can't make more than enough to\r\npay Mrs. Atterson, and for my laundry, and buy a new suit of overalls\r\nand a pair of shoes occasionally.\r\n\r\n“No, sir!” concluded Hiram. “There's nothing in it. Not for a fellow\r\nlike me, at any rate. I'd better be back on the farm--and I wish I was\r\nthere now.”\r\n\r\nHe had been to church that morning; but after the late dinner at his\r\nboarding house had set out on this lonely walk. Now he had nothing to\r\nlook forward to as he returned but the stuffy parlor of Mrs. Atterson's\r\nboarding house, the cold supper in the dining-room, which was attended\r\nin a desultory fashion by such of the boarders as were at home, and then\r\na long, dull evening in his room, or bed after attending the evening\r\nservice at the church around the corner.\r\n\r\nHiram even shrank from meeting the same faces at the boarding house\r\ntable, hearing the same stale jokes or caustic remarks about Mrs.\r\nAtterson's food from Fred Crackit and the young men boarders of his\r\nclass, or the grumbling of Mr. Peebles, the dyspeptic invalid, or the\r\ninane monologue of Old Lem Camp.\r\n\r\nAnd Mrs. Atterson herself--good soul though she was--had gotten on Hiram\r\nStrong's nerves, too. With her heat-blistered face, near-sighted eyes\r\npeering through beclouded spectacles, and her gown buttoned up hurriedly\r\nand with a gap here and there where a button was missing, she was the\r\ntypically frowsy, hurried, nagged-to-death boarding house mistress.\r\n\r\nAnd as for “Sister,” Mrs. Atterson's little slavey and\r\nmaid-of-all-work----\r\n\r\n“Well, Sister's the limit!” smiled Hiram, as he turned into the street,\r\nwith its rows of ugly brick houses on either hand. “I believe Fred\r\nCrackit has got it right. Mrs. Atterson keeps Sister instead of a\r\ncat--so there'll be something to kick.”\r\n\r\nThe half-grown girl--narrow-chested, round shouldered, and sallow--had\r\nbeen taken by Mrs. Atterson from some charity institution. “Sister,” as\r\nthe boarders all called her, for lack of any other cognomen, would have\r\nher yellow hair in four attenuated pigtails hanging down her back, and\r\nshe would shuffle about the dining-room in a pair of Mrs. Atterson's old\r\nshoes----\r\n\r\n“By Jove! there she is now,” exclaimed the startled youth.\r\n\r\nAt the corner of the street several “slices” of the brick block had\r\nbeen torn away and the lot cleared for the erection of some business\r\nbuilding. Running across this open space with wild shrieks and spilling\r\nthe milk from the big pitcher she carried--milk for the boarders' tea,\r\nHi knew--came Mrs. Atterson's maid.\r\n\r\nBehind her, and driving her like a horse by the ever present “pigtails,”\r\n bounded a boy of about her own age--a laughing, yelling imp of a boy\r\nwhom Hiram knew very well.\r\n\r\n“That Dan Dwight is the meanest little scamp at this end of the town!”\r\n he said to himself.\r\n\r\nThe noise the two made attracted only the idle curiosity of a few\r\npeople. It was a locality where, even on Sundays, there was more or less\r\nnoise.\r\n\r\nSister begged and screamed. She feared she would spill the milk and told\r\nDan, Junior, so. But he only drove her the harder, yelling to her to\r\n“Get up!” and yanking as hard as he could on the braids.\r\n\r\n“Here! that's enough of that!” called Hiram, stepping quickly toward the\r\ntwo.\r\n\r\nFor Sister had stopped exhausted, and in tears.\r\n\r\n“Be off with you!” commanded Hiram. “You've plagued the girl enough.”\r\n\r\n“Mind your business, Hi-ram-Lo-ram!” returned Dan, Junior, grabbing at\r\nSister's hair again.\r\n\r\nHiram caught the younger boy by the shoulder and whirled him around.\r\n\r\n“You run along to Mrs. Atterson, Sister,” he said, quietly. “No, you\r\ndon't!” he added, gripping Dan, Junior, more firmly. “You'll stop right\r\nhere.”\r\n\r\n“Lemme be, Hi Strong!” bawled the other, when he found he could not\r\neasily jerk away. “It'll be the worse for you if you don't.”\r\n\r\n“Just you wait until the girl is home,” returned Hiram, laughing. It was\r\nan easy matter for him to hold the writhing Dan, Junior.\r\n\r\n“I'll fix you for this!” squalled the boy. “Wait till I tell my father.”\r\n\r\n“You wouldn't dare tell your father the truth,” laughed Hi.\r\n\r\n“I'll fix you,” repeated Dan, Junior, and suddenly aimed a vicious kick\r\nat his captor.\r\n\r\nHad the kick landed where Dan, Junior, intended--under Hi's kneecap--the\r\nlatter certainly would have been “fixed.” But the country youth was too\r\nagile for him.\r\n\r\nHe jumped aside, dragged Dan, Junior, suddenly toward him, and then gave\r\nhim a backward thrust which sent the lighter boy spinning.\r\n\r\nNow, it had rained the day before and in a hollow beside the path was\r\na puddle several inches deep. Dan, Junior, lost his balance, staggered\r\nback, tripped over his own clumsy heels, and splashed full length into\r\nit.\r\n\r\n“Oh, oh!” he bawled, managing to get well soaked before he scrambled\r\nout. “I'll tell my father on you, Hi Strong. You'll catch it for this!”\r\n\r\n“You'd better run home before you catch cold,” said Hiram, who could not\r\nhelp laughing at the young rascal's plight. “And let girls alone another\r\ntime.”\r\n\r\nTo himself he said: “Well, the goodness knows I couldn't be much more\r\nin bad odor with Mr. Dwight than I am already. But this escapade of his\r\nprecious son ought to about 'fix' me, as Dan, Junior, says.\r\n\r\n“Whether I want to, or not, I reckon I will be looking for another job\r\nin a very few days.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II. AT MRS. ATTERSON'S\r\n\r\nWhen you came into “Mother” Atterson's front hall (the young men\r\nboarders gave her that appellation in irony) the ghosts of many ancient\r\nboiled dinners met you with--if you were sensitive and unused to the\r\nodors of cheap boarding houses--a certain shock.\r\n\r\nHe was starting up the stairs, on which the ragged carpet threatened to\r\nsend less agile persons than Mrs. Atterson's boarders headlong to\r\nthe bottom at every downward trip, when the clang of the gong in the\r\ndining-room announced the usual cold spread which the landlady thought\r\ndue to her household on the first day of the week.\r\n\r\nHiram hesitated, decided that he would skip the meal, and started up\r\nagain. But just then Fred Crackit lounged out of the parlor, with Mr.\r\nPeebles following him. Dyspeptic as he was, Mr. Peebles never missed a\r\nmeal himself, and Crackit said:\r\n\r\n“Come on, Hi-Low-Jack! Aren't you coming down to the usual feast of\r\nreason and flow of soul?”\r\n\r\nCrackit thought he was a natural humorist, and he had to keep up his\r\nreputation at all times and seasons. He was rather a dissipated-looking\r\nman of thirty years or so, given to gay waistcoats and wonderfully knit\r\nties. A brilliant as large as a hazel-nut--and which, in some lights,\r\nreally sparkled like a diamond--adorned the tie he wore this evening.\r\n\r\n“I don't believe I want any supper,” responded Hiram, pleasantly.\r\n\r\n“What's the matter? Got some inside information as to what Mother\r\nAtterson has laid out for us? You're pretty thick with the old girl,\r\nHi.”\r\n\r\n“That's not a nice way to speak of her, Mr. Crackit,” said Hi, in a low\r\nvoice.\r\n\r\nThe other boarders--those who were in the house-straggled into the\r\nbasement dining-room one after the other, and took their places at the\r\nlong table, each in his customary manner.\r\n\r\nThat dining-room at Mother Atterson's never could have been a cheerful\r\nplace. It was long, and low-ceiled, and the paper on the walls was\r\na dingy red, so old that the figure on it had retired into the\r\nbackground--been absorbed by it, so to speak.\r\n\r\nThe two long, dusty, windows looked upon an area, and were grilled half\r\nway up by wrought-iron screens which, too, helped to shut out the light\r\nof day.\r\n\r\nThe long table was covered by a red figured table cloth. The “castors”\r\n at both ends and in the middle were the ugliest--Hiram was sure--to be\r\nfound in all the city of Crawberry. The crockery was of the coarsest\r\nkind. The knives and forks were antediluvian. The napkins were as coarse\r\nas huck towels.\r\n\r\nBut Mrs. Atterson's food--considering the cost of provisions and the\r\ncharge she made for her table--was very good. Only it had become a habit\r\nfor certain of the boarders, led by the jester, Crackit, to criticise\r\nthe viands.\r\n\r\nSometimes they succeeded in making Mrs. Atterson angry; and sometimes,\r\nHiram knew, she wept, alone in the dining-room, after the harumscarum,\r\nthoughtless crowd had gone.\r\n\r\nOld Lem Camp--nobody save Hiram thought to put “Mr.” before the old\r\ngentleman's name--sidled in and sat down beside the country boy, as\r\nusual. He was a queer, colorless sort of person--a man who never looked\r\ninto the face of another if he could help it. He would look all around\r\nHiram when he spoke to him--at his shoulder, his shirtfront, his hands,\r\neven at his feet if they were visible, but never at his face.\r\n\r\nAnd at the table he kept up a continual monologue. It was difficult\r\nsometimes for Hiram to know when he was being addressed, and when poor\r\nMr. Camp was merely talking to himself.\r\n\r\n“Let's see--where has Sister put my napkin--Oh! here it is--You've been\r\nfor a walk, have you, young man?--No, that's not my napkin; I didn't\r\nspill any gravy at dinner--Nice day out, but raw--Goodness me! can't I\r\nhave a knife and fork?--Where's my knife and fork?--Sister certainly has\r\nforgotten my knife and fork.--Oh! Here they are--Yes, a very nice day\r\nindeed for this time of year.”\r\n\r\nAnd so on. It was quite immaterial to Mr. Camp whether he got an answer\r\nto his remarks to Hiram, or not. He went on muttering to himself, all\r\nthrough the meal, sometimes commenting upon what the others said at the\r\ntable--and that quite shrewdly, Hiram noticed; but the other boarders\r\nconsidered him a little cracked.\r\n\r\nSister smiled sheepishly at Hiram as she passed the tea. She drowned\r\nhis tea with milk and put in no less than four spoonfuls of sugar. But\r\nalthough the fluid was utterly spoiled for Hiram's taste he drank it\r\nwith fortitude, knowing that the girl's generosity was the child of her\r\ngratitude; for both sugar and milk were articles very scantily supplied\r\nat Mother Atterson's table.\r\n\r\nThe mistress herself did not appear. Now that he was down here in the\r\ndining-room, Hiram lingered. He hated the thought of going up to his\r\nlonely and narrow quarters at the top of the house.\r\n\r\nThe other boarders trailed out of the room and up stairs, one after\r\nanother, Old Lem Camp being the last to go. Sister brought in a dish of\r\nhot toast between two plates and set it at the upper end of the table.\r\nThen Mrs. Atterson appeared.\r\n\r\nHiram knew at once that something had gone wrong with the boarding\r\nhouse mistress. She had been crying, and when a woman of the age of Mrs.\r\nAtterson indulges in tears, her personal appearance is never improved.\r\n\r\n“Oh, that you, Hi?” she drawled, with a snuffle. “Did you get enough to\r\neat?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, Mrs. Atterson,” returned the youth, starting to get up. “I have\r\nhad plenty.”\r\n\r\n“I'm glad you did,” said the lady. “And you're easy 'side of most of\r\n'em, Hiram. You're a real good boy.”\r\n\r\n“I reckon I get all I pay for, Mrs. Atterson,” said her youngest\r\nboarder.\r\n\r\n“Well, there ain't many of 'em would say that. And they was awful\r\nprovokin' this noon. That roast of veal was just as good meat as I could\r\nfind in market; and I don't know what any sensible party would want\r\nbetter than that prune pie.\r\n\r\n“Well! I hope I won't have to keep a boarding house all my life. It's a\r\nthankless task. An' it ties a body down so.\r\n\r\n“Here's my uncle--my poor mother's only brother and about the only\r\nrelative I've got in the world--here's Uncle Jeptha down with the grip,\r\nor suthin', and goodness knows if he'll ever get over it. And I can't\r\nleave to go and see him die peaceable.”\r\n\r\n“Does he live far from here?” asked Hiram, politely, although he had no\r\nparticular reason for being interested in Uncle Jeptha.\r\n\r\n“He lives on a farm out Scoville way. He's lived there most all his\r\nlife. He used to make a right good living off'n that farm, too; but it's\r\nrun down some now.\r\n\r\n“The last time I was out there, two years ago, he was just keepin' along\r\nand that's all. And now I expect he's dying, without a chick or child\r\nof his own by him,” and she burst out crying again, the tears sprinkling\r\nthe square of toast into which she continued to bite.\r\n\r\nOf course, it was ridiculous. A middle-aged woman weeping and eating\r\ntoast and drinking strong boiled tea is not a romantic picture. But as\r\nHiram climbed to his room he wished with all his heart that he could\r\nhelp Mrs. Atterson.\r\n\r\nHe wasn't the only person in the world who seemed to have got into\r\na wrong environment--lots of people didn't fit right into their\r\ncircumstances in life.\r\n\r\n“We're square pegs in round holes--that's what we are,” mused Hiram.\r\n“That's what I am. I wish I was out of it. I wish I was back on the\r\nfarm.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III. A DREARY DAY\r\n\r\nDaniel Dwight's Emporium, the general store was called, and it was in a\r\nvery populous part of the town of Crawberry. Old Daniel was a driver, he\r\nseldom had clerks enough to handle his trade properly, and nobody could\r\nsuit him. As general helper and junior clerk, Hiram Strong had remained\r\nwith the concern longer than any other boy Daniel had hired in years.\r\n\r\nWhen the early Monday morning rush was over, and there was moment's\r\nbreathing space, Hiram went to the door to re-arrange the trays of\r\nvegetables which were his particular care. Hiram had a knack of making\r\na bank of the most plebeian vegetable and salads look like the\r\ndisplay-window of a florist.\r\n\r\nNow the youth looked out upon a typical city street, the dwellings\r\non either side being four and five story tenement houses, occupied by\r\nartisans and mechanics.\r\n\r\nA few quarreling children paddled sticks, or sailed chip boats, in the\r\ngutters.\r\n\r\n“Come on, now! Get a move on you, Hi!” sounded the raucous voice of\r\nDaniel Dwight the elder, behind him in the store.\r\n\r\nHiram went at his task with neither interest nor energy.\r\n\r\nAll about him the houses and the street were grimy and depressing. It\r\nhad been a gray and murky morning; but overhead a patch of sky was as\r\nblue as June. He suddenly saw a flock of pigeons wheeling above the\r\ntunnel of the street, and the boy's heart leaped at the sight.\r\n\r\nHe longed for freedom. He wished he could fly, up, up, up above the\r\nhousetops and the streets, like those feathered fowl.\r\n\r\nHe knew he was stagnating here in this dingy store; the deadly sameness\r\nof his life chafed him sorely.\r\n\r\n“I'd take another job if I could find one,” he muttered, stirring up the\r\nbunches of yellowing radish leaves and trying to make them look fresh.\r\n“And Old Daniel is likely to give me a chance to hunt a job pretty\r\nsudden--the way he talks. But if Dan, Junior, told him what happened\r\nyesterday, I wonder the old gentleman hasn't been after me with a sharp\r\nstick.”\r\n\r\nFrom somewhere--out of the far-distant open country where it had been\r\nbreathing all night the quivering pines, and brown swamps, and the\r\nwhite and gray checkered fields that would soon be upturned by the\r\nplowshares--a vagrant wind wandered into the city street.\r\n\r\nThe lingering, but faint perfume wafted here from God's open world to\r\ndie in this man-made town inspired in the youth thoughts and desires\r\nthat had been struggling within him for expression for days past.\r\n\r\n“I know what I want,” said Hiram Strong, aloud. “I want to get back to\r\nthe land!”\r\n\r\nThe progress of the day was not inducive to a hopeful outlook for\r\nHiram. When closing time came he was heartily sick of the business of\r\nstorekeeping, if he never had been before.\r\n\r\nAnd when he dragged himself home to the boarding house, he found the\r\natmosphere there as dreary as the street itself. The boarders were\r\ngrumpy and Mrs. Atterson was in a tearful state again.\r\n\r\nHiram could not stay in his room. It was a narrow, cold place at the end\r\nof the back hall at the top of the house. There was a little, painted\r\nbureau in it, one leg of which had been replaced by a brick, and the\r\nlittle glass was so blue and blurred that he never could see in it\r\nwhether his tie was straight or not.\r\n\r\nThere was a chair, a shelf for books, and a narrow folding bed. When the\r\nbed was dropped down for his occupancy at night, he could not get the\r\ndoor open. Had there ever been a fire at Atterson's at night, Hiram's\r\nbest chance for escape would have been by the window.\r\n\r\nSo this evening, to kill the miserable stretch of time until sleep\r\nshould come to him, the boy went out and walked the streets.\r\n\r\nTwo things had saved Hiram Strong from getting into bad company on these\r\nevening rambles. One was the small amount of money he earned, and the\r\nother was the naturally clean nature of the boy. The cheap amusements\r\nwhich lured on either hand did not attract him.\r\n\r\nBut the dangers are there in every city, and they lurk for every boy in\r\na like position.\r\n\r\nThe main thoroughfare in this part of the town where Hiram boarded\r\nwas brightly lighted, gaudy electric signs attracting notice to cheap\r\npicture shows, catch-penny arcades, cheap jewelry stores, and the ever\r\npresent saloons and pool rooms.\r\n\r\nIt looked bright, and warm, and lively in many of these places; but the\r\ncountry-bred boy was cautious.\r\n\r\nNow and then a raucous-voiced automobile shot along the street; the\r\nelectric cars made their usual clangor, and there was still some\r\nordinary traffic of the day dribbling away into the side streets, for it\r\nwas early in the evening.\r\n\r\nHiram was about to turn into one of these side streets on his way back\r\nto Mrs. Atterson's. Turning the corner was a handsome span of horses\r\nattached to a comfortable but mud-bespattered carriage. It was plainly\r\nfrom the country.\r\n\r\nThe light at the corner of the street shone brightly into the carriage.\r\nHiram saw a well-built man in a gray greatcoat and slouch hat, holding\r\nthe reins over the backs of the spirited horses.\r\n\r\nBeside him sat a girl. She could have been no more than twelve or\r\nfourteen--not so old as Sister, by a year or two. But how different she\r\nwas from the starved-looking, boarding house slavey!\r\n\r\nShe was framed in furs--rich, gray and black furs that muffled her\r\nfrom top to toe, only leaving her brilliant, dark little face with its\r\nperfect features shining like a jewel in its setting.\r\n\r\nShe was talking laughingly to the big man beside her, and he was looking\r\ndown at her. Perhaps this was why he did not see what lay just ahead--or\r\nperhaps the glare of the street light blinded him, as it must have the\r\nhorses, as the equipage turned into the darker side street.\r\n\r\nBut Hiram saw their peril. He sprang into the street with a cry of\r\nwarning. And he was lucky enough to seize the nigh horse by the bridle\r\nand pull both the high-steppers around.\r\n\r\nThere was an excavation--an opening for a water-main--in this street.\r\nThe workmen had either neglected to leave a red lantern, or malicious\r\nboys had stolen it.\r\n\r\nAnother moment and the horses would have been in this excavation and\r\neven now the carriage swayed. One forward wheel went over the edge of\r\nthe hole, and for the minute it was doubtful whether Hiram had saved the\r\noccupants of the carriage by his quick action, or had accelerated the\r\ncatastrophe.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV. THE LOST CARD\r\n\r\nHad Hiram Strong not been a muscular youth for his age, and sturdy\r\nwithal, the excited horses would have broken away from him and the\r\ncarriage would certainly have gone into the ditch.\r\n\r\nBut he had a grip on the bridle reins now that could not be broken,\r\nalthough the horses plunged and struck fire from the stones of the\r\nstreet with their shoes. He dragged them forward, the carriage pitched\r\nand rolled for a moment, and then stood upright again, squarely on its\r\nfour wheels.\r\n\r\n“All right, lad! I've got 'em!” exclaimed the gentleman in the carriage.\r\n\r\nHe had a hearty, husky sort of voice--a voice that came from deep down\r\nin his chest and was more than a little hoarse. But there was no quiver\r\nof excitement in it. Indeed, he who had been in peril was much less\r\ndisturbed by the incident than was Hiram himself.\r\n\r\nNor had the girl screamed, or otherwise voiced her terror. Now Hiram\r\nheard her say, as he stepped back from the plunging horses:\r\n\r\n“That is a good boy, Daddy. Speak to him again.”\r\n\r\nThe man in gray laughed. He was now holding in the frightened team with\r\none firm hand while he fumbled in the pocket of his big coat with the\r\nother.\r\n\r\n“He certainly has got some muscle, that lad,” announced the gentleman.\r\n“Here, son, where can I find you when I'm in town again?”\r\n\r\n“I work at Dwight's Emporium,” replied Hiram, rather diffidently.\r\n\r\n“All right. Thanks. Here's my card. You're the kind of a boy I like.\r\nI'll surely look you up.”\r\n\r\nHe held out the bit of pasteboard to Hiram; but as the youth stepped\r\nnearer to reach it, the impatient horses sprang forward and the carriage\r\nrolled swiftly by him.\r\n\r\nThe card flipped from the man's fingers. Hiram grabbed for it, but\r\nmissed the card. It fluttered into the excavation in the street and the\r\nshadow hid it completely from the boy's gaze.\r\n\r\nHad there been a lantern nearby, as there should have been, Hiram would\r\nhave taken it to search for the lost card. For he felt suddenly as\r\nthough Opportunity had brushed past him.\r\n\r\nThe man in the carriage evidently lived out of town. He might be a\r\nprosperous farmer. And, being a farmer, he might be able to give Hiram\r\njust the sort of job he was looking for.\r\n\r\nThe card, of course, would have put Hiram in touch with the man. And he\r\nseemed like a hearty, good-natured individual.\r\n\r\n“And the girl--his daughter--was as pretty as a picture,” thought Hiram,\r\nas he turned wearily toward the boarding house. “Well! I don't know that\r\nI'll ever see either of them again; but if I could learn that man's name\r\nand address I'd certainly look him up.”\r\n\r\nSo much did this thought disturb him that he was up an hour earlier than\r\nusual the next morning and hurried to work by the way of the excavation\r\nin the street where the incident had occurred.\r\n\r\nBut he could not find the card, although he got down into the ditch to\r\nsearch for it. The loose sand, perhaps, rattling down from the sides of\r\nthe excavation during the night, had buried the bit of pasteboard, and\r\nHiram went on to Dwight's Emporium more disheartened than ever.\r\n\r\nThe work there went worse that morning. Old Daniel Dwight drove the\r\nyoung fellow from one task to another. The other clerks got a minute's\r\ntime to themselves now and then; but the proprietor of the store seemed\r\nto have his keen eyes on Hiram continually.\r\n\r\nThere was always a slow-up in the work about ten o'clock, and Hiram had\r\na request to make. He asked Old Daniel for an hour off.\r\n\r\n“An hour off--with all this work to do? What do you mean, boy?” roared\r\nthe proprietor. “What do you want an hour for?”\r\n\r\n“I've got an errand,” replied Hiram, quietly.\r\n\r\n“Well, what is it?” snarled the old man, curiously.\r\n\r\n“Why--it's a private matter. I can't tell you,” returned the youth,\r\ncoolly.\r\n\r\n“No good, I'll be bound--no good. I don't see why I should let you off\r\nan hour----”\r\n\r\n“I work many an hour overtime for you, Mr. Dwight,” put in Hiram.\r\n\r\n“Yes, yes; that's all right. That's the agreement. You knew you'd have\r\nto when you came to work at the Emporium. Stick to your contract, boy.”\r\n\r\n“Then why don't you stick to yours?” demanded the youth, boldly.\r\n\r\n“Eh! Eh! What do you mean by that?” cried Mr. Dwight, glaring at Hiram\r\nthrough his spectacles.\r\n\r\n“I mean that when I came to work for you seven months ago, you promised\r\nthat, if I suited after six months, you would raise my wages. And you\r\nhaven't done so,” said the young fellow, firmly.\r\n\r\nFor a moment the proprietor of the Emporium was dumb. It was true. He\r\nhad promised just that. He had got the boy cheaper by so doing. But\r\nnever before had he hired a boy who stayed as long as six months, so he\r\nhad never had to raise his wages.\r\n\r\n“Well, well!”\r\n\r\nHe stammered for a moment; then a shrewd thought came to his mind.\r\nHe actually smiled. When Mr. Dwight smiled it was worse than when he\r\ndidn't.\r\n\r\n“I told you that if you suited me I'd raise your pay, did I?” he\r\nsnarled. “Well, you don't suit me. You never have suited me. Therefore,\r\nyou get no raise, young man.”\r\n\r\nHiram was not astonished; he was only indignant. Another boy might have\r\nexpressed his anger by flaring up and tendering his resignation on the\r\nspot.\r\n\r\nBut Hiram had that fear of debt in his breast which is almost always a\r\ncharacteristic of the frugal, country-bred person. He had saved little.\r\nHe had no prospect of another job. And every Saturday night he was\r\nexpected to pay Mrs. Atterson three dollars and a half.\r\n\r\n“At any rate, Mr. Dwight,” he said, quietly, after a minute's silence,\r\n“I want an hour to myself this morning.”\r\n\r\n“And I'll dock ye ten cents for it,” declared the old man.\r\n\r\n“You can do as you like about that,” returned Hiram, and he walked into\r\nthe back room, took off his apron, and got into his coat.\r\n\r\nHe had it in mind to go to the big market, where the farmers drove in\r\nfrom out of town, and see if he could meet one of his old neighbors,\r\nor anybody else who could tell him of prospect of work for the coming\r\nseason. It was early yet for farmers to be looking for extra hands; but\r\nHiram hoped that he might see something in prospect for the future. He\r\nhad made up his mind that, if possible, he would not take another job in\r\ntown.\r\n\r\n“And I can see pretty plainly that I've got about through at the\r\nEmporium,” he thought, as he approached the open space devoted by the\r\nCity of Crawberry to a market for the truckmen and farmers who drove in\r\nwith their wares from the surrounding country.\r\n\r\nAt this time of day the bustle of market was over. The farmers would\r\nhave had their breakfasts in the little restaurants which encircled the\r\nmarket-place, or would be preparing to drive home again. The hucksters\r\nand push-cart merchants were picking up “seconds” and lot-ends of\r\nvegetables for their trade. The cobbles of the market-place was a litter\r\nof cabbage leaves, spilled sprouts, spoiled potatoes, and other refuse.\r\n\r\nHiram walked about, looking for somebody whom he knew; but most of the\r\nfaces around the market were strange to him. Several farmers he spoke to\r\nabout work; but they were not hiring hands, so, when his hour was up, he\r\nwent back to the Emporium, more despondent than before.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V. THE COMMOTION AT MOTHER ATTERSON'S\r\n\r\nBy chance that evening Hiram got home to his boarding house in good\r\nseason. The early boarders--“early birds” Crackit always termed\r\nthem--had not yet sat down to the long table in the dingy dining-room.\r\n\r\nIndeed, the supper gong had not been pounded by Sister, and some of the\r\nyoung men were grouped impatiently in the half-lighted parlor.\r\n\r\nThrough the swinging door into the steaming kitchen Hiram saw a huge\r\nblack woman waddling about the range, and heard her husky voice berating\r\nSister for not moving faster. Chloe only appeared when a catastrophe\r\nhappened at the boarding-house--and a catastrophe meant the removal of\r\nMrs. Atterson from her usual orbit.\r\n\r\n“She's gone to the funeral. That Uncle Jeptha of hern is dead,”\r\n whispered Sister in Hiram's ear when she put his soup in front of him.\r\n\r\n“Ah-ha!” observed Mr. Crackit, eyeing Hiram with his head on one side,\r\n“secrets, eh? Inside information of what's in the pudding sauce?”\r\n\r\nNothing went right at the boarding-house during the next two days. And\r\nfor Hiram Strong nothing seemed to go right anywhere!\r\n\r\nHe demanded--and got the permission, with another ten-cent tax--another\r\nhour off to visit the market. But he found nobody who would hire a boy\r\nat once. Some of the farmers doubted if he knew as much about farm-work\r\nas he claimed to know. He was, after all, a boy, and some of them would\r\nnot believe that he had even worked in the country.\r\n\r\nAffairs at the Emporium were getting strained, too. Daniel Dwight was as\r\nshrewd a man as the next one. He saw plainly that his junior clerk was\r\ngetting ready--like the many who had gone before him--for a flitting.\r\n\r\nHe knew the signs of discontent, although Hiram prided himself on doing\r\nhis work just as well as ever.\r\n\r\nThen, there was a squabble with Dan, Junior. The imp was always\r\nunderfoot on Saturdays. He was supposed to help--to run errands, and\r\ntake out in a basket certain orders to nearby customers who might be in\r\na hurry.\r\n\r\nBut usually when you wanted the boy he was in the alley pitching buttons\r\nwith loafing urchins of his own kind--“alley rats” his father angrily\r\ncalled them--or leading a predatory gang of the same unsavory companions\r\nin raids on other stores in the neighborhood.\r\n\r\nAnd Dan, Junior “had it in” for Hiram. He had not forgiven the bigger\r\nboy for pitching him into the puddle.\r\n\r\n“An' them was my best clo'es, and now maw says I've got to wear 'em just\r\nthe same on Sunday, and they're shrunk and stained,” snarled the younger\r\nDan, hovering about Hiram as the latter re-dressed the fruit stand\r\nduring a moment's let-up in the Saturday morning rush. “Gimme an\r\norange.”\r\n\r\n“What! At five cents apiece?” exclaimed Hiram. “Guess not. Go look in\r\nthe basket under the bench; maybe there's a specked one there.”\r\n\r\n“Nope. Dad took 'em all home last night and maw cut out the specks and\r\nsliced 'em for supper. Gimme a good orange.”\r\n\r\n“Ask your father,” said Hiram.\r\n\r\n“Naw, I won't!” declared young Dwight, knowing very well what his\r\nfather's answer would be.\r\n\r\nHe suddenly made a grab for the golden globe on the apex of Hiram's\r\nhandsomest pyramid.\r\n\r\n“Let that alone, Dan!” cried Hiram, and seized the youngster by the\r\nwrist.\r\n\r\nDan, Junior, was a wiry little scamp, and he twisted and turned, and\r\nkicked and squalled, and Hiram was just wrenching the orange from his\r\nhand when Mr. Dwight came to the door.\r\n\r\n“What's this? What's this?” he demanded. “Fighting, are ye? Why don't\r\nyou tackle a fellow of your own size, Hi Strong?”\r\n\r\nAt that Dan, Junior, saw his chance and broke into woeful sobs. He was a\r\ngood actor.\r\n\r\n“I've a mind to turn you over to a policeman, Hiram,” cried “Mr. Dwight,\r\nThat's what I've a mind to do.”\r\n\r\n“I suppose you'll discharge me first, won't you?” suggested Hiram,\r\nscornfully.\r\n\r\n“You can come in and git your money right now, young man,” said the\r\nproprietor of the Emporium. “Dan! let them oranges alone. And don't you\r\ngo away from here. I'll want you all day to-day. I shall be short-handed\r\nwith this young scalawag leaving me in the lurch like this.”\r\n\r\nIt had come so suddenly that Hiram almost lost his breath. He had part\r\nof his wish, that was sure. He was not likely to work for Daniel Dwight\r\nany longer.\r\n\r\nThe old man led the way back to his office. He had a little pile of\r\nmoney already counted out upon the desk. It was plain that he had\r\nintended quarreling with Hiram and getting rid of him at this time,\r\nfor he had the young fellow's wages figured up to t hat very hour--and\r\ntwenty cents deducted for the two hours Hiram had had “off.”\r\n\r\n“But that isn't fair. I'm willing to work to the end of the day. I ought\r\nto get my wages in full for the week, save for the twenty cents,” said\r\nHiram mildly.\r\n\r\nTo tell the truth, now that he had lost his job--unpleasant as it had\r\nbeen--Hiram was more than a little troubled. He was indeed about to be\r\ncast adrift.\r\n\r\n“You'll git jest that sum, and not a cent more,” declared Mr. Dwight,\r\nsharply. “And if you start any trouble here I'll call in the officer on\r\nthe beat--yes, I will! I don't know but I ought to deduct the cost of\r\nDan, Junior's, spoiled suit, too. He says you an' he was skylarkin' on\r\nSunday and that's how he fell into the water.”\r\n\r\nHiram had no answer to make to this. What was the use? He took the\r\nmoney, slipped it into his pocket, and went out.\r\n\r\nHe did not linger around the Emporium. Nor was he scarcely out of sight\r\nwhen a man driving a span of handsome bay horses halted his team before\r\nthe store, jumped out, and went in.\r\n\r\n“Are you the proprietor of Dwight's Emporium?” asked the man in the\r\ngray coat and hat, in his hearty tones. “You are? Glad to meet you! I'm\r\nlooking for a young man who works for you.”\r\n\r\n“Who's that? What do you want of him?” asked Dan, Senior, doubtfully,\r\nand rubbing his hand, for the stranger's grip had been as hearty as his\r\nvoice.\r\n\r\nThe other laughed in his jovial way. “Why, to tell the truth, I don't\r\nknow his name. I didn't ask him. He's not much more than a boy--a sturdy\r\nyoungster with a quick way with him. He did me a service the other\r\nevening and I wanted to see him.”\r\n\r\n“There ain't any boy working here,” snapped Mr. Dwight. “Them's all\r\nthe clerks I got behind the counter--and there ain't one of 'em under\r\nthirty, I'll be bound.”\r\n\r\n“That's so,” admitted the stranger. “And although it was so dark I could\r\nnot see that fellow's face, and I didn't ask his name, I am sure he was\r\nyoung.”\r\n\r\n“I jest discharged the only boy I had--and scamp enough he was,” snarled\r\nMr. Dwight. “If you were looking for him, you'd have been sorry to find\r\nhim. I didn't know but I'd have to send for a policeman to git him off\r\nthe premises.”\r\n\r\n“What--what?”\r\n\r\n“That's what I tell you. He was a bad egg. Mebbe he's the boy you\r\nwant--but you won't get no good of him when you find him. And I've no\r\nidea where he's to be found now,” and the old man turned his back on the\r\nman in the gray coat and went into his office.\r\n\r\nThe stranger climbed back into his buggy and took up the lines again\r\nwith a preoccupied headshake.\r\n\r\n“Now, I promised Lettie,” he muttered, “that I'd find out all about that\r\nboy--and maybe bring him home with me. Funny that man gave his such\r\na bad character. Wish I could have seen the lad's face the other\r\nnight--that would have told the story.\r\n\r\n“Well,” and he dismissed the matter with a sigh, for he was busy man,\r\n“if he's got my card, and he is out of a job, perhaps he'll look me up.\r\nThen we'll see.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI. THIS DIDN'T GET BY HIRAM\r\n\r\n“I've sure got plenty of time now to look for a job,” observed Hiram\r\nStrong when he was two blocks away from Dwight's Emporium. “But I\r\ndeclare I don't know where to begin.”\r\n\r\nFor his experience in talking with the farmers around the market had\r\nrather dashed Hiram's hope of getting a place in the country at once. It\r\nwas too early in the season. Nor did it look so much like Spring as it\r\nhad a week ago. Already Hiram had to turn up the collar of his rough\r\ncoat, and a few flakes of snow were settling on his shoulders as he\r\nwalked.\r\n\r\n“It's winter yet,” he mused. “If I can't get something to do in the\r\ncity for a few weeks to tide me over, I'm afraid I shall have to find a\r\ncheaper place to board than at Mother Atterson's.”\r\n\r\nAfter half an hour of strolling from street to street, however, Hiram\r\ndecided that there was nothing in that game. He must break in somewhere,\r\nso he turned into the very next warehouse.\r\n\r\n“Want a job? I'll be looking for one myself pretty soon, if business\r\nisn't better,” was the answer he got from the first man he approached.\r\n\r\nBut Hiram kept at it, and got short answers and long answers, pleasant\r\nones and some that were not so pleasant; but all could be summed up in\r\nthe single monosyllable:\r\n\r\n“No!”\r\n\r\n“I certainly am a failure here in town,” Hiram thought, as he walked\r\nthrough the snow-blown streets. “How foolish I was ever to have come\r\naway from the country.\r\n\r\n“A fellow ought to stick to the job he is fitted for--and that's sure.\r\nBut I didn't know. I thought there would be forty chances in town to one\r\nin the country.\r\n\r\n“And there doesn't seem to be a single chance right now. Why, I'll have\r\nto leave Mrs. Atterson's, if I can't find a job before next week is out!\r\n\r\n“This mean old town is over-crowded with fellows like me looking for\r\nwork. And when it comes to office positions, I haven't a high-school\r\ndiploma, nor am I fitted for that kind of a job.\r\n\r\n“I want to be out of doors. Working in a stuffy office wouldn't suit me.\r\nOh, as a worker in the city I am a rank failure, and that's all there is\r\nabout it!”\r\n\r\nHe went home to supper much more tired than he would have been had he\r\ndone a full day's work at Dwight's Emporium. Indeed, the job he had lost\r\nnow loomed up in his troubled mind as much more important than it had\r\nseemed when he had desired to change it for another.\r\n\r\nMother Atterson was at home. She hadn't more than taken off her bonnet,\r\nhowever, and had had but a single clash with Chloe in the kitchen.\r\n\r\n“I smelled it burnin' the minute I set my foot on the front step!”\r\n she declared. “You can't fool my nose when it comes to smelling burned\r\nstuff.\r\n\r\n“Well, Hiram,” she continued, too full of news to remark that he was at\r\nhome long before his time, “I saw the poor old soul laid away, at least.\r\nI wish now I'd got Chloe in before, and gone to see Uncle Jeptha before\r\nhe was in his coffin.\r\n\r\n“But I didn't think I could afford it, and that's a fact. We poor folks\r\ncan't have many pleasures in this world of toil and trouble!” added\r\nthe boarding house mistress, to whom even the break of a funeral, or a\r\ndeath-bed visit, was in the nature of a solemn amusement.\r\n\r\n“And there the old man went and made his will years ago, unbeknownst to\r\nanybody, and me bein' his only blood relation, as you might say, though\r\nit was years since I seen him much, but he remembered my mother with\r\nlove,” and she began to wipe her eyes.\r\n\r\n“Poor old man! And me with a white-faced cow that I'm afraid of my life\r\nof, and an old horse that looks like a moth-eaten hide trunk we to\r\nhave in our garret at home when I was a little girl, and belonged to my\r\ngreat-great-grandmother Atterson----\r\n\r\n“And there's a mess of chickens that eat all day long and don't lay an\r\negg as far as I could see, besides a sow and a litter of six pigs that\r\nsqueal worse than the the switch-engine down yonder in the freight\r\nyard----\r\n\r\n“And they're all to be fed, and how I'm to do it, and feed the boarders,\r\ntoo, I don't for the life of me see!” finished Mrs. Atterson, completely\r\nout of breath.\r\n\r\n“What do you mean?” cried Hiram, suddenly waking to the significance of\r\nthe old lady's chatter. “Do you mean he willed you these things?”\r\n\r\n“Of course,” she returned, smoothing down her best black skirt. “They\r\ngo with the house and outbuildings--`all the chattels and appurtenances\r\nthereto', the will read.”\r\n\r\n“Why, Mrs. Atterson!” gasped Hiram. “He must have left you the farm.”\r\n\r\n“That's what I said,” returned the old lady, complacently. “And what I'm\r\nto do with it I've no more idea than the man in the moon.”\r\n\r\n“A farm!” repeated Hiram, his face flushing and his eyes beginning to\r\nshine.\r\n\r\nNow, Hiram Strong was not a particularly handsome youth, but in his\r\nexcitement he almost looked so.\r\n\r\n“Eighty acres, so many rods, and so many perches,” pursued Mrs.\r\nAtterson, nodding. “That's the way it reads. The perches is in the\r\nhenhouse, I s'pose--though why the description included them and not the\r\nhens' nests I dunno.”\r\n\r\n“Eighty acres of land!” repeated Hiram in a daze.\r\n\r\n“All free and clear. Not a dollar against it--only encumbrances is the\r\nchickens, the cow, the horse and the pigs,” declared Mrs. Atterson. “If\r\nit wasn't for them it might not be so bad. Scoville's an awfully nice\r\nplace, and the farm's on an automobile road. A body needn't go blind\r\nlooking for somebody to go by the door occasionally.\r\n\r\n“And if it got so bad here finally that I couldn't make a livin' keeping\r\nboarders,” pursued the lady, “I might go out there and live in the old\r\nhouse--which isn't much, I know, but it's a shelter, and my tastes are\r\nsimple, goodness knows.”\r\n\r\n“But a farm, Mrs. Atterson!” broke in Hiram. “Think what you can do with\r\nit!”\r\n\r\n“That's what I'd like to have, you, or somebody else tell me,” exclaimed\r\nthe old lady, tartly. “I ain't got no more use for a farm than a cat has\r\nfor two tails!”\r\n\r\n“But--but isn't it a good farm?” queried Hiram, puzzled.\r\n\r\n“How do I know?” snapped the boarding house mistress. “I wouldn't know\r\none farm from another, exceptin' two can't be in exactly the same spot.\r\nOh! do you mean, could I sell it?”\r\n\r\n“No----”\r\n\r\n“The lawyer advised me not to sell just now. He said something about the\r\nstate of the real estate market in that section. Prices would be better\r\nin a year or two. And then, the old place is mighty run down.”\r\n\r\n“That's what I mean,” Hiram hastened to say. “Has it been cropped to\r\ndeath? Is the soil worn out? Can't you run it and make something out of\r\nit?”\r\n\r\n“For pity's sake!” ejaculated the good lady, “how should I know? And I\r\ncouldn't run it--I shouldn't know how.\r\n\r\n“I've got a neighbor-woman in the house just now to 'tend to things--and\r\nthat's costin' me a dollar and a half a week. And there'll be taxes to\r\npay, and--and--Well, I just guess I'll have to try and sell it now and\r\ntake what I can get.\r\n\r\n“Though that lawyer says that if the place was fixed up a little and\r\ncrops put in it would make a thousand dollars' difference in the selling\r\nprice. That is, after a year or two.\r\n\r\n“But bless us and save us” cried Mrs. Atterson, “I'd be swamped with\r\nexpenses before that time.”\r\n\r\n“Mebbe not,” said Hiram Strong, trying to repress his eagerness. “Why\r\nnot try it?”\r\n\r\n“Try to run that farm?” cried she. “Why, I'd jest as lief go up in one\r\no' those aeroplanes and try to run it. I wouldn't be no more up in the\r\nair then than I would be on a farm,” she added, grimly.\r\n\r\n“Get somebody to run it for you--do the outside work, I mean, Mrs.\r\nAtterson,” said Hiram. “You could keep house out there just as well as\r\nyou do here. And it would be easy for you to learn to milk----”\r\n\r\n“That whitefaced cow? My goodness! I'd just as quick learn to milk a\r\nswitch-engine!”\r\n\r\n“But it's only her head that looks so wicked to you,” laughed Hiram.\r\n“And you don't milk that end.”\r\n\r\n“Well--mebbe,” admitted Mrs. Atterson, doubtfully. “I reckon I could\r\nmake butter again--I used to do that when I was a girl at my aunt's. And\r\neither I'd make those hens lay or I'd have their dratted heads off!\r\n\r\n“And my goodness me! To get rid of the boarders--Oh, stop your talkin',\r\nHi Strong! That is too good to ever be true. Don't talk to me no more.”\r\n\r\n“But I want to talk to you, Mrs. Atterson,” persisted the youth,\r\neagerly.\r\n\r\n“Well, who'd I get to do the outside work--put in crops, and 'tend 'em,\r\nand look out for that old horse?”\r\n\r\nHiram almost choked. This opportunity should not get past him if he\r\ncould help it!\r\n\r\n“Let me do it, Mrs. Atterson. Give me a chance to show you what I can\r\ndo,” he cried. “Let me run the farm for you!”\r\n\r\n“Why--why do you suppose that it could be made to pay us, Hi?” demanded\r\nhis landlady, in wonder.\r\n\r\n“Other farms pay; why not this one?” rejoined Hiram, sententiously. “Of\r\ncourse,” he added, his native caution coming to the surface, “I'd want\r\nto see the place--to look it over pretty well, in fact--before I made\r\nany agreement. And I can assure you, Mrs. Atterson, if I saw no chance\r\nof both you and me making something out of it I should tell you so.”\r\n\r\n“But--but your job, Hiram? And I wouldn't approve of your going out\r\nthere and lookin' at the place on a Sunday.”\r\n\r\n“I'll take the early train Monday morning,” said the youth, promptly.\r\n\r\n“But what will they say at the store? Mr. Dwight----”\r\n\r\n“He turned me off to-day,” said Hiram, steadily. “So I won't lose\r\nanything by going out there.\r\n\r\n“I tell you what I'll do,” he added briskly. “I won't have any too much\r\nmoney while I'm out of a job, of course. And I shall be out there at\r\nScoville a couple of days looking the place over, it's probable.\r\n\r\n“So, if you will let me keep this three dollars and a half I should\r\npay you for my next week's board to-night, I'll pay my own expenses out\r\nthere at the farm and if nothing comes of it, all well and good.”\r\n\r\nMrs. Atterson had fumbled for her spectacles and now put them on to\r\nsurvey the boy's earnest face.\r\n\r\n“Do you mean to say you can run a farm, Hi Strong?” she asked.\r\n\r\n“I do,” and he smiled confidently at her.\r\n\r\n“And make it pay?”\r\n\r\n“Perhaps not much profit the first season; but if the farm is fertile,\r\nand the marketing conditions are right, I know I can make it pay us both\r\nin two years.”\r\n\r\n“I've got a little money saved up. I could sell the house in a week, for\r\nit's always full and there are always lone women like me with a little\r\ndriblet of money to exchange for a boarding house--heaven help us for\r\nthe fools we are!” Mrs. Atterson exclaimed.\r\n\r\n“And I expect you could raise vegetables enough to part keep us, Hi,\r\neven if the farm wasn't a great success?”\r\n\r\n“And eggs, and chickens, and the pigs, and milk from the cow,” suggested\r\nHiram.\r\n\r\n“Well! I declare, that's so,” admitted Mrs. Atterson. “I'd been lookin'\r\non all them things as an expense. They could be made an asset, eh?”\r\n\r\n“I should hope so,” responded Hiram, smiling.\r\n\r\n“And I could get rid of these boarders--My soul and body!” gasped\r\nthe tired woman, suddenly. “Do you suppose it's true, Hi? Get rid of\r\nworryin' about paying the bills, and whether the boarders are all going\r\nto keep their jobs and be able to pay regularly--And the gravy!\r\n\r\n“Hiram Strong! If you can show me a way out of this valley of\r\ntribulation I'll be the thankfullest woman that you ever seen. It's a\r\nbargain. Don't you pay me a cent for this coming week. And I shouldn't\r\nhave taken it, anyway, when you're throwed out of work so. That's a\r\nmighty mean man, that Daniel Dwight.\r\n\r\n“You go right ahead and look that farm over. If it looks good, you come\r\nback and we'll strike a bargain, I know. And--and--Just to think\r\nof getting rid of this house and these boarders!” and Mrs. Atterson\r\nfinished by wiping her eyes again vigorously.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII. HOW HIRAM LEFT TOWN\r\n\r\nHiram Strong was up betimes on Monday morning--Sister saw to that. She\r\nrapped on his door at four-thirty.\r\n\r\nSometimes Hiram wondered when the girl ever slept. She was still\r\ndragging about the kitchen or dining-room when he went to bed, and she\r\nwas first down in the morning--even earlier than Mrs. Atterson herself.\r\n\r\nThe boarding house mistress was not intentionally severe with Sister;\r\nbut the much harassed lady had never learned to make her own work easy,\r\nso how should she be expected to be easy on Sister?\r\n\r\nOnce or twice Hiram had talked with the orphan. Sister had a dreadful\r\nfear of returning to the “institution” from which Mrs. Atterson had\r\ntaken her. And Sister's other fearful remembrance was of an old woman\r\nwho beat her and drank much gin and water.\r\n\r\nNot that she had been ill-treated at the institution; but she had been\r\ndressed in an ugly uniform, and the girls had been rough and pulled her\r\n“pigtails” like Dan, Junior.\r\n\r\n“Once a gentleman came to see me,” Sister confided to Hiram. “He was\r\na lawyer gentleman, the matron told me. He knew my name--but I've\r\nforgotten it now.\r\n\r\n“And he said that somebody who once belonged to me--or I once belonged\r\nto them--had died and perhaps there would be some money coming to me.\r\nBut it couldn't have been the old woman I lived with, for she never had\r\nonly money enough for gin!\r\n\r\n“Anyhow, I was glad. I axed him how much money--was it enough to treat\r\nall the girls in the institution one round of ice-cream soda, and he\r\nlaffed, he did. And he said yes--just about enough for that, if he could\r\nget it for me. And I ran away and told the girls.\r\n\r\n“I promised them all a treat. But the man never came again, and by and\r\nby the big girls said they believed I storied about it, and one night\r\nthey came and dragged me out of bed and hung me out of the window by my\r\nwrists, till I thought my arms would be pulled right out of the sockets.\r\nThey was awful cruel--them girls. But when I axed the matron why the\r\nman didn't come no more, she put me off. I guess he was only\r\nfoolin',” decided Sister, with a sigh. “Folks like to fool me--like Mr.\r\nCrackit--eh?”\r\n\r\nBut Mrs. Atterson told Hiram, when he asked about Sister's meagre little\r\nstory, that the institution had promised to let her know if the lawyer\r\never returned to make further inquiries about the orphan. Somebody\r\nreally had died who was of kin to the girl, but through some error the\r\ninstitution had not made a proper record of her pedigree and the lawyer\r\nwho had instituted the search a seemed to have dropped out of sight.\r\n\r\nBut Hiram was not troubled by poor Sister's private affairs upon this\r\nMonday morning. It was the beginning of a new week, indeed, to him. He\r\nhad turned over a new leaf of experience. He hoped that he was pretty\r\nnear to the end of his harsh city existence.\r\n\r\nHe hurried downstairs, long in advance of the other boarders, and Mrs.\r\nAtterson served him some breakfast, although there was no milk for the\r\ncoffee.\r\n\r\n“I dunno where that plague o' my life, Sister's, gone,” sputtered the\r\nold lady, fussing about, between dining-room and kitchen. “I sent her\r\nout ten minutes ago for the milk. And if you want to get that first\r\ntrain to Scoville you've got to hurry.”\r\n\r\n“Never mind the milk,” laughed the young fellow. “The train's more\r\nimportant this morning.”\r\n\r\nSo he bolted the remainder of his breakfast, swallowed the black coffee,\r\nand ran out.\r\n\r\nHe arrived at Scoville while the morning was still young. It was not his\r\nintention to go at once to the Atterson farm. There were matters which\r\nhe desired to look into in addition to judging the quality of the soil\r\non the place and the possibility of making it pay.\r\n\r\nHe went to the storekeepers and asked questions about the prices paid\r\nfor garden truck. He walked about the town and saw the quality of\r\nthe residences, and noted what proportion of the townsfolk cultivated\r\ngardens of their own.\r\n\r\nThere was a big girls' boarding-school, and two small, but\r\nwell-patronized hotels. The proprietors of these each owned a farm;\r\nbut they told Hiram that it was necessary for them to buy much of their\r\ntable vegetables from city produce men, as the neighboring farmers did\r\nnot grow much.\r\n\r\nIn talking with one storekeeper Hiram mentioned the fact that he was\r\ngoing to look at the Atterson place with a view to farming it for its\r\nnew owner. When he walked out of the store he found himself accosted\r\nby a lean, snaky-looking man who had stood within the store the moment\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\n“What's this widder woman goin' to do with the farm old Jeptha left\r\nher?” inquired the man, looking at Hiram slyly.\r\n\r\n“We don't know yet, sir, what we shall do with it,” the young fellow\r\nreplied.\r\n\r\n“You her son?”\r\n\r\n“No. I may work for her--can't tell till I've looked at the place.”\r\n\r\n“It ain't much to look at,” said the man, quickly. “I come near buying\r\nit once, though. In fact--”\r\n\r\nHe hesitated, still eyeing Hiram sideways. The boy waited for him to\r\nspeak again. He did not wish to be impolite; but he did not like the\r\nman's appearance.\r\n\r\n“What do y' reckon this Mis' Atterson would sell for?” finally demanded\r\nthe man.\r\n\r\n“She has been advised not to sell--at present.”\r\n\r\n“Who by?”\r\n\r\n“Mr. Strickland, the lawyer.”\r\n\r\n“Humph! Mebbe I'd buy it--and give her a good price for it--right now.”\r\n\r\n“What do you consider a good price?” asked Hiram, quietly.\r\n\r\n“Twelve hundred dollars,” said the man.\r\n\r\n“I will tell her. But I do not think she would sell for that\r\nprice--nothing like it, in fact.”\r\n\r\n“Well, mebbe she'll feel different when she comes to think it over.\r\nNo use for a woman trying to run a farm. And if she has to pay for\r\neverything to be done, she'll be in a hole at the end of the season. I\r\nguess she ain't thought of that?”\r\n\r\n“It wouldn't be my place to point it out to her,” returned Hiram,\r\n“coolly, if it were so, and I wanted to work for her.”\r\n\r\n“Humph! Mebbe not. Well, my name's Pepper. Mebbe I'll be out to see her\r\nsome day,” he said, and turned away.\r\n\r\n“He's one of the people who will discourage Mrs. Atterson,” thought\r\nHiram. “And he has an axe to grind. If I decide to take the job of\r\nmaking this farm pay, I'm going to have the agreement in black and\r\nwhite with Mrs. Atterson; for there will be a raft of Job's comforters,\r\nperhaps when we get settled on the place.”\r\n\r\nIt was late in the afternoon before Hiram was ready to start for the\r\nfarm itself. He had made some enquiries, and had decided to stop at a\r\nneighbor's for overnight, instead of going to the house where a lone\r\nwoman had been left in charge by Mrs. Atterson.\r\n\r\nThe Pollocks had been recommended to Hiram, and by leaving the road\r\nwithin half a mile of the Atterson farm, and cutting across the fields,\r\nhe came into the dooryard of the Pollock place. A well-grown boy, not\r\nmuch older than himself, was splitting some chunks at the woodpile. He\r\nstopped work to gaze at the visitor with much curiosity.\r\n\r\n“From what they told me in town,” Hi said, holding out his hand with a\r\nsmile, “you must be Henry Pollock?”\r\n\r\nThe boy blushed, but awkwardly took and shook Hi's hand.\r\n\r\n“That's what they call me--Henry Pollock--when they don't call me Hen.”\r\n\r\n“Well, I'll make a bargain with you, Henry,” laughed Hiram. “I don't\r\nlike to have my name cut off short, either. My name's Hiram Strong. So\r\nif you'll agree to always call me `Hiram' I'll always call you `Henry.'”\r\n\r\n“It's a go!” returned the other, shaking hands again. “You going to live\r\naround here? Or are you jest visiting?”\r\n\r\n“I don't know yet,” confessed Hiram, sitting down beside the boy. “You\r\nsee, I've come out to look at the Atterson place.”\r\n\r\n“That's right over yonder. You can see the roof if you stand up,” said\r\nHenry, quickly.\r\n\r\nHiram stood up and, in the light of the early sunset, he caught a\r\nglimpse of the roof in question.\r\n\r\n“Your folks going to buy it of the old lady Uncle Jeptha left it to?”\r\n asked Henry, with pardonable curiosity. “Or are you going to rent it?”\r\n\r\n“What do you think of renting it?” queried Hiram, showing that he had\r\nYankee blood in him by answering one question with another.\r\n\r\n“Well--it's pretty well run down, and that's a fact. The old man\r\ncouldn't do much the last few years, and them Dickersons who farmed it\r\nfor him ain't no great shakes of farmers, now I tell you!”\r\n\r\n“Well, I want to look the farm over before I decide what I'll do,” said\r\nHiram, slowly. “And of course I can't do that to-night. They told me in\r\ntown that sometimes you take boarders?”\r\n\r\n“In the summer we do,” returned Henry.\r\n\r\n“Do you think your folks will put me up overnight?”\r\n\r\n“Why, I reckon so--Hiram Strong, did you say your name was? Come right\r\nin,” added Henry, hospitably, “and I'll ask mother.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII. THE LURE OF GREEN FIELDS\r\n\r\nThe Pollocks proved to be a neighborly family--and a large one. As Henry\r\nsaid, there was a “whole raft of young 'uns” younger than he was. They\r\nmade Hiram very welcome at the supper table, and showed much curiosity\r\nabout his personal affairs.\r\n\r\nBut the young fellow had been used to just such people before. They were\r\nnot a bad sort, and if they were keenly interested in the affairs of\r\nother people, it was because they had few books and newspapers, and\r\nsmall chance to amuse themselves in the many ways which city people\r\nhave.\r\n\r\nHiram slept with Henry that night, and Henry agreed to show the visitor\r\nover the Atterson place the next day.\r\n\r\n“I know every stick and stone of it as well as I do ourn,” declared\r\nHenry. “And Dad won't mind my taking time now. Later--Whew! I tell you,\r\nwe hafter just git up an' dust to make a crop. Not much chance for fun\r\nafter a week or two until the corn's laid by.”\r\n\r\n“You know all the boundaries of the Atterson farm, do you?” Hiram asked.\r\n\r\n“Yes, sir!” replied Henry, eagerly. “And say! do you like to fish?”\r\n\r\n“Of course; who doesn't?”\r\n\r\n“Then we'll take some lines and hooks along--and mother'll lend us a pan\r\nand kettle. Say! We'll start early--'fore anybody's a-stir--and I bet\r\nthere'll be a big trout jumping in the pool under the big sycamore.”\r\n\r\n“That certain-sure sounds good to me!” cried Hiram, enthusiastically.\r\n\r\nSo it was agreed, and before day, while the mist was yet rolling across\r\nthe fields, and the hedge sparrows were beginning to chirp, the two set\r\nforth from the Pollock place, crossed the wet fields, and the road, and\r\nset off down the slope of a long hill, following, as Henry said, near\r\nthe east boundary of the Atterson farm--the line running from the\r\nautomobile road to the river.\r\n\r\nIt was a dull spring morning. The faint breeze that stirred on the\r\nhillside was damp, but odorous with new-springing herbs. As Hiram\r\nand Henry descended the aisle of the pinewood, the treetops whispered\r\ntogether as though curious of these bold humans who disturbed their\r\nsolitude.\r\n\r\n“It doesn't look as though anybody had been here at the back end of old\r\nJeptha Atterson's farm for years,” said Hiram.\r\n\r\n“And it's a fact that nobody gets down this way often,” Henry responded.\r\n\r\nThe brown tags sprung under their feet; now and then a dew-wet branch\r\nswept Hiram's cheek, seeking with its cold fingers to stay his progress.\r\nIt was an enchanted forest, and the boy, heart-hungry from his two years\r\nof city life, was enchanted, too!\r\n\r\nHiram learned from talking with his companion that at one time the\r\npiece of thirty-year-old timber they were walking through had been\r\ntilled--after a fashion. But it had never been properly cleared, as the\r\nhacked and ancient stumpage betrayed.\r\n\r\nHere and there the lines of corn rows which had been plowed when the\r\nlast crop was laid by were plainly revealed to Hiram's observing eye.\r\nWhere corn had grown once, it should grow again; and the pine timber\r\nwould more than pay for being cut, for blowing out the big stumps with\r\ndynamite, and tam-harrowing the side hill.\r\n\r\nFinally they reached a point where the ground fell away more abruptly\r\nand the character of the timber changed, as well. Instead of the stately\r\npines, this more abrupt declivity was covered with hickory and oak. The\r\nsparse brush sprang out of rank, black mold.\r\n\r\nCharmed by the prospect, Hiram and Henry descended this hill and came\r\nsuddenly, through a fringe of brush, to the border of an open cove, or\r\nbottom.\r\n\r\nAt some time this lowland, too, had been cleared and cultivated; but now\r\nyoung pines, quick-springing and lush, dotted the five or six acres of\r\npractically open land which was as level as one's palm.\r\n\r\nIt was two hundred yards, or more, in width and at the farther side\r\na hedge of alders and pussywillows grew, with the green mist of young\r\nleaves upon them, and here and there a ghostly sycamore, stretching its\r\nslender bole into the air, edged the course of the river.\r\n\r\nHiram viewed the scene with growing delight. His eyes sparkled and\r\na smile came to his lips as he crossed, with springy steps, the open\r\nmeadow on which the grass was already showing green in patches.\r\n\r\nBetween the line of the wood they had left and the breadth of the meadow\r\nwas a narrow, marshy strip into which a few stones had been cast, and on\r\nthese they crossed dry shod. The remainder of the bottom-land was firm.\r\n\r\n“Ain't this jest a scrumptious place?” demanded Henry, and Hiram agreed.\r\n\r\nAt the river's edge they parted the bushes and looked down upon the\r\noily-flowing brown flood. It was some thirty feet broad and with the\r\nmelting of the snows in the mountains was so deep that no sign was\r\napparent here of the rocks which covered its bed.\r\n\r\nHenry led the way up the bank of the stream toward a huge sycamore that\r\nleaned lovingly over the water. An ancient wild grape vine, its\r\nbutt four inches through and its roots fairly in the water, had a\r\nstrangle-hold upon this decrepit forest monarch, its tendrils reaching\r\nthe sycamore's topmost branch.\r\n\r\nUnder the tree was a deep hole where flotsam leaves and twigs performed\r\nan endless treadmill dance in the grasp of the eddy.\r\n\r\nSuddenly, while their gaze clung to the dimpling water, there was a\r\nflash of a bronze body--a streak of light along the surface of the\r\npool--and two widening circles showed where the master of the hole had\r\nleaped for some insect prey.\r\n\r\n“See him?” called Henry, but under his breath.\r\n\r\nHiram nodded, but squeezed his companion's hand for silence. He almost\r\nheld his own breath for the moment, as they moved back from the pool\r\nwith the soundless step of an Indian.\r\n\r\n“That big feller is my meat,” declared Henry.\r\n\r\n“Go to it, boy!” urged Hiram, and set about preparing the camp.\r\n\r\nHe cut with his big jack-knife and set up a tripod of green rods in a\r\njiffy, skirmished for dry wood, lit his fire, filled the kettle from the\r\nriver at a little distance from the eddy, and hung it over the blaze to\r\nboil.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Henry fished out a line and an envelope of hooks from an inner\r\npocket, cut a springy pole back on the hillside, rigged his line and\r\nhook, and kicked a hole in the soft, rich soil until he unearthed a fat\r\nangleworm.\r\n\r\nWith this impaled upon the hook he cautiously approached the pool under\r\nthe sycamore and cast gently. The struggling worm sank slowly; the water\r\nwrinkled about the line; but there followed no tug at the hook, although\r\nHenry stood patiently for several moments. He cast again, and yet again,\r\nwith like result.\r\n\r\n“Ah, ba!” muttered Hiram, in his ear; “this fellow's appetite needs\r\ntickling. He is being fed too well and turns up his nose at a common\r\nearthworm, does he? Let me show you a wrinkle, Henry.”\r\n\r\nHenry drew the line ashore again and shook off the useless bait.\r\n\r\n“You're, not fishing,” Hiram continued with a grim smile. “You've just\r\nbeen drowning a worm. But I'll show that old fellow sulking down below\r\nthere that he is no match this early in the spring for a pair of hungry\r\nboys!”\r\n\r\nHe recrossed the meadow, and the stepping stones, to the wood. He had\r\nnoticed a log lying in the path as he descended the hillside. With the\r\ntoe of his boot he kicked a patch of bark from the log, and thereby lay\r\nbare the wavering trail of a busy grub. Following the trail he quickly\r\nfound the fat, juicy insect, which immediately took the earthworm's\r\nplace upon the hook.\r\n\r\nAgain Henry cast and this time, before the grub even touched the surface\r\nof the pool, the fish leaped and swallowed the tempting morsel, hook and\r\nall!\r\n\r\nThere was no playing of the fish on Henry's part. A quick jerk and the\r\ngasping spotted beauty, a pound and a quarter, or more, in weight, lay\r\nupon the sward beside the crackling fire.\r\n\r\n“Whoop-ee!” called Henry, excitedly. “That's Number One!”\r\n\r\nWhile Hiram dexterously scaled and cleaned the first trout, Henry caught\r\na couple more. Hiram brought forth, too, the coffee, salt and pepper,\r\nsugar, a piece of fat salt pork and two table knives and forks.\r\n\r\nHe raked a smooth bed in the glowing coals, sliced the pork thin, laid\r\nsome slices in the pan and set that upon the coals, where the pork began\r\nto sputter almost at once.\r\n\r\nThe water in the kettle was boiling and he made the coffee. Then he laid\r\nthe trout upon the pan with three slices of pork upon each, and sat\r\nback upon his haunches beside Henry enjoying the delicious odor in\r\nanticipation of the more solid delights of breakfast.\r\n\r\nThey had hard crackers and with these, and drinking the coffee from\r\nthe kettle itself, when it was cool enough, the two boys feasted like\r\nmonarchs.\r\n\r\n“By Jo!” exclaimed Henry. “This beats maw's soda biscuit and fat meat\r\ngravy!”\r\n\r\nBut as he ate, Hiram's gaze traveled again and again across the\r\nscrub-grown meadow. The lay of the land pleased him. The richness of the\r\nsoil had been revealed when they dug the earthworm.\r\n\r\nFor thousands of years the riches of yonder hillside had been washing\r\ndown upon the bottom, and this alluvial was rich beyond computation.\r\n\r\nHere were several acres, the young farmer knew, which, however\r\nover-cropped the remainder of Uncle Jeptha's land had been, could not be\r\nimpoverished in many seasons.\r\n\r\n“It's as rich as cream!” muttered he, thoughtfully. “Grubbing out these\r\nyoung pines wouldn't take long. There's a heavy sod and it would have\r\nto be ploughed deeply. Then a crop of corn this year, perhaps--late corn\r\nfor fear the river might overflow it in June. And then----\r\n\r\n“Great Scot!” ejaculated Hiram, slapping his knee, “what wouldn't grow\r\non this bottom land?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, it's mighty rich,” agreed Henry. “But it's a long way from the\r\nhouse--and then, the river might flood it over. I've seen water running\r\nover this bottom two feet deep--once.”\r\n\r\nThey finished the al fresco meal and Hiram leaped up, inspired by his\r\nthoughts to brisker movements.\r\n\r\n“Whatever else this old farm has on it, I vow and declare,” he said,\r\n“this five or six acres alone might be made to pay a profit on the whole\r\ninvestment!”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX. THE BARGAIN IS MADE\r\n\r\nHenry showed Hiram the “branch”, a little stream flowing into the river,\r\nwhich marked the westerly boundary of the farm for some ways, and they\r\nset off up the steep bank of this stream.\r\n\r\nThis back end of the farm--quite forty acres, or half of the whole\r\ntract--had been entirely neglected by the last owner of the property for\r\na great many years. It was some distance from the house, for the farm\r\nwas a long and narrow strip of land from the highway to the river, and\r\nUncle Jeptha had had quite all he could do to till the uplands and the\r\nfields adjacent to his home.\r\n\r\nThey came upon these open fields--many of them filthy with dead weeds\r\nand littered with sprouting bushes--from the rear. Hiram saw that the\r\nfences were in bad repair and that the back of the premises gave every\r\nindication of neglect and shiftlessness.\r\n\r\nPerhaps not exactly the latter; Uncle Jeptha had been an old man and\r\nunable to do much active work for some years. But he had cropped certain\r\nof his fields “on shares” with the usual results--impoverished soil,\r\nilly-tilled crops, and the land left in a slovenly condition which\r\nseveral years of careful tillage would hardly overcome.\r\n\r\nNow, although Hiram's father had been of the tenant class, he had farmed\r\nother men's land as he would his own. Owners of outlying farms had been\r\nglad to get Mr. Strong to till their fields.\r\n\r\nHe had known how to work, he knew the reasons for every bit of labor\r\nhe performed, and he had not kept his son in ignorance of them. As they\r\nworked together the father had explained to the son what he did, and why\r\nhe did it, The results of their work spoke for themselves, and Hiram had\r\na retentive memory.\r\n\r\nMr. Strong, too, had been a great, reader--especially in the winter when\r\nthe farmer naturally has more time in-doors.\r\n\r\nYet he was a “twelve months farmer”; he knew that the winter, despite\r\nthe broken nature of the work, was quite as valuable to the successful\r\nfarmer as the other seasons of the year.\r\n\r\nThe elder Strong knew that men with more money, and more time for\r\nexperimenting than he had, were writing and publishing all the time\r\nhelps for the wise farmer. He subscribed for several papers, and read\r\nand digested them carefully.\r\n\r\nHiram, even during his two years in the city, had continued his\r\nsubscription (although it was hard to find the money sometimes) to two\r\nor three of those publications that his father had most approved. And\r\nthe boy had read them faithfully.\r\n\r\nHe was as up-to-date in farming lore now, if not in actual practise, as\r\nhe had been when he left the country to try his fortune in Crawberry.\r\n\r\nBeyond the place where the branch turned back upon itself and hid its\r\nsource in the thicker timber, Hiram saw that the fields were open on\r\nboth sides of this westerly line of the farm.\r\n\r\n“Who's our neighbor over yonder, Henry?” he asked.\r\n\r\n“Dickerson--Sam Dickerson,” said Henry. “And he's got a boy, Pete, no\r\nolder than us. Say, Hiram, you'll have trouble with Pete Dickerson.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, I guess not,” returned the young farmer, laughing. “Trouble is\r\nsomething that I don't go about hunting for.”\r\n\r\n“You don't have to hunt it when Pete is round,” said Henry with a wry\r\ngrin. “But mebbe he won't bother you, for he's workin' near town--for\r\nthat new man that's moved into the old Fleigler place. Bronson's his\r\nname. But if Pete don't bother you, Sam may.”\r\n\r\n“Sam's the father?”\r\n\r\n“Yep. And one poor farmer and mean man, if ever there was one! Oh, Pete\r\ncomes by his orneriness honestly enough.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, I hope I'll have no trouble with any neighbor,” said Hiram,\r\nhopefully.\r\n\r\nThey came briskly to the outbuildings belonging to Mrs. Atterson's newly\r\nacquired legacy. Hiram glanced into the hog lot. She looked like a good\r\nsow, and the six-weeks-old shoats were in good condition. In a couple of\r\nweeks they would be big enough to sell if Mrs. Atterson did not care to\r\nraise them.\r\n\r\nThe shoats were worth six dollars a pair, too; he had inquired the day\r\nbefore about them. There was practically eighteen dollars squealing in\r\nthat pen--and eighteen dollars would go a long way toward feeding the\r\nhorse and cow until there was good pasturage for them.\r\n\r\nThese animals named were in the small fenced barnyard. In the fall and\r\nwinter the old man had fed a good deal of fodder and other roughage, and\r\nduring the winter the horse and cow had tramped this coarse material,\r\nand the stable scrapings, into a mat of fairly good manure.\r\n\r\nHe looked the horse and cow over with more care. It was a fact that\r\nthe horse looked pretty shaggy; but he had been used little during\r\nthe winter, and had been seldom curried. A ragged coat upon a horse\r\nsometimes covers quite as many good points as the same quality of\r\ngarment does upon a man.\r\n\r\nWhen Hiram spoke to the beast it came to the fence with a friendly\r\nforward thrust of its ears, and the confidence of a horse that has been\r\nkindly treated and looks upon even a strange human as a friend.\r\n\r\nIt was a strong and well-shaped animal, more than twelve years old,\r\nas Hiram discovered when he opened the creature's mouth, but seemingly\r\nsound in limb. Nor was he too large for work on the cultivator, while\r\nsturdy enough to carry a single plow.\r\n\r\nHiram passed him over with a satisfactory pat on the nose and turned\r\nto look at the white-faced cow that had so terrified Mrs. Atterson. She\r\nwasn't a bad looking beast, either, and would freshen shortly. Her calf\r\nwould be worth from twelve to fifteen dollars if Mrs. Atterson did not\r\nwish to raise it. Another future asset to mention to the old lady when\r\nhe returned.\r\n\r\nThe youth turned his attention to the buildings themselves--the barn,\r\nthe cart shed, the henhouse, and the smaller buildings. That famous old\r\ndecorating firm of Wind & Weather had contracted for all painting done\r\naround the Atterson place for the many years; but the buildings were not\r\notherwise in a bad state of repair.\r\n\r\nA few shingles had been blown off the roofs; here and there a board was\r\nloose. With a hammer and a few nails, and in a few hours, many of these\r\nsmall repairs could be accomplished. And a coat or two of properly\r\nmixed and applied whitewash would freshen up the whole place and--like\r\ncharity--cover a multitude of sins.\r\n\r\nHenry bade him good-bye now, they shook hands, and Hiram agreed to let\r\nhis new friend know at once if he decided to come with Mrs. Atterson to\r\nthe farm.\r\n\r\n“We can have heaps of fun--you and me,” declared Henry.\r\n\r\n“It isn't so bad,” soliloquized the young farmer when he was alone.\r\n“There'd be time to put the buildings and fences in good shape before\r\nthe spring work came on with a rush. There's fertilizer enough in the\r\nbarnyard and the pig pen and the hen run--with the help of a few pounds\r\nof salts and some bone meal, perhaps--to enrich a right smart kitchen\r\ngarden and spread for corn on that four acre lot yonder.\r\n\r\n“Of course, this land up here on the hill needs humus. If it has been\r\ncropped on shares, as Henry says, all the enrichment it has received\r\nhas been from commercial fertilizers. And necessarily they have made the\r\nland sour. It probably needs lime badly.\r\n\r\n“Yes, I can't encourage Mrs. Atterson to look for a profit in anything\r\nthis year. It will take a year to get that rich bottom into shape\r\nfor--for what, I wonder? Onions? Celery? It would raise 'em both. I'll\r\nthink about that and look over the market prospects more fully before I\r\ndecide.”\r\n\r\nFor already, you see, Hiram had come to the decision that this old farm\r\ncould be made to pay. Why not? The true farmer has to have imagination\r\nas well as the knowledge and the perseverance to grow crops. He must be\r\nable in his mind's eye to see a field ready for the reaping before he\r\nputs in a seed.\r\n\r\nHe did not go to the house on this occasion, but after casually\r\nexamining the tools and harness, and the like, left by the old man, he\r\ncut off across the upper end of the farm and gave the neglected open\r\nfields of this upper forty a casual examination.\r\n\r\n“If she had the money to invest, I'd say buy sheep and fence these\r\nfields and so get rid of the weeds. They've grown very foul through\r\nneglect, and cultivating them for years would not destroy the weeds as\r\nsheep would in two seasons.\r\n\r\n“But wire fencing is expensive--and so are good sheep to begin with. No.\r\nSlow but sure must be our motto. I mustn't advise any great outlay of\r\nmoney--that would scare her to death.\r\n\r\n“It will be hard enough for her to put out money all season long before\r\nthere are any returns. We'll go, slow,” repeated Hiram.\r\n\r\nBut when he left the farm that afternoon he went swiftly enough to\r\nScoville and took the train for the not far distant city of Crawberry.\r\nThis was Tuesday evening and he arrived just about supper time at Mrs.\r\nAtterson's.\r\n\r\nThe reason for Hiram's absence, and the matter of Mrs. Atterson's legacy\r\naltogether, had been kept from the boarders. And there was no time until\r\nafter the principal meal of the day was off the lady's mind for Hiram to\r\nsay anything to her.\r\n\r\n“She's a good old soul,” thought Hiram. “And if it's in my power to make\r\nthat farm pay, and yield her a competency for her old age, I'll do it.”\r\n\r\nMeanwhile he was not losing sight of the fact that there was something\r\ndue to him in this matter. He was bound to see that he got his\r\nshare--and a just share--of any profits that might accrue from the\r\nventure.\r\n\r\nSo, after the other boarders had scattered, and Mrs. Atterson had eaten\r\nher own late supper, and Sister was swashing plates and knives and forks\r\nabout in a big pan of hot water in the kitchen sink, (between whiles\r\ndoing her best to listen at the crack of the door) the landlady and\r\nHiram Strong threshed out the project fully.\r\n\r\nIt was not all one-sided; for Mrs. Atterson, after all, had been\r\nbargaining all her life and could see the “main chance” as quickly as\r\nthe next one. She had not bickered with hucksters, chivvied grocerymen,\r\nfought battles royal with butchers, and endured the existence of a Red\r\nIndian amidst allied foes for two decades without having her wits ground\r\nto a razor edge.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, Hiram Strong, although a boy in years, had been his\r\nown master long enough to take care of himself in most transactions, and\r\nwithal had a fund of native caution. They jotted down memoranda of the\r\npoints on which they were agreed, which included the following:\r\n\r\nMrs. Atterson, as “party of the first part”, agreed to board Hiram until\r\nthe crops were harvested the second year. In addition she was to pay\r\nhim one hundred dollars at Christmas time this first year, and another\r\nhundred at the conclusion of the agreement--i. e., when the second\r\nyear's crop was harvested.\r\n\r\nBeside, of the estimated profits of the second year's crop, Hiram was\r\nto have twenty-five per cent. This profit was to be that balance in the\r\nfarm's favor (if such balance there was) over and above the actual cost\r\nof labor, seed, and such purchased fertilizer or other supplies as were\r\nnecessary. Mrs. Atterson agreed likewise to supply one serviceable horse\r\nand such tools as might be needed, for the place was to be run as “a\r\none-horse farm.”\r\n\r\nOn the other hand Hiram agreed to give his entire time to the farm, to\r\nwork for Mrs. Atterson's interest in all things, to make no expenditures\r\nwithout discussing them first with her, and to give his best care and\r\nattention generally to the farm and all that pertained thereto. Of\r\ncourse, the old lady was taking Hiram a good deal on trust. But she had\r\nknown the boy almost two years and he had been faithful and prompt in\r\ndischarging his debts to her.\r\n\r\nBut it was up to the young fellow to “make good.” He could not expect\r\nto make any profit for his employer the first year; but he would be\r\nexpected to do so the second season, or “show cause.”\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen these matters were all discussed and the little memorandum\r\nsigned, Hiram Strong, in his own room, thought the situation over very\r\nseriously. He was facing the biggest responsibility that he had obliged\r\nto assume in his whole life.\r\n\r\nThis was no boyish job; it was man's work. He had put his hand to an\r\nagreement that might influence his whole future, and certainly would\r\nmake or break his credit as a trustworthy youth and one of his word.\r\n\r\nDuring these past days Hiram had determined to “get back to the soil”\r\n and to get back to it in a business-like way. He desired to make good\r\nfor Mrs. Atterson so that he might some time have the chance to make\r\ngood for somebody else on a bigger scale.\r\n\r\nHe did not propose to be “a one-horse farmer” all his days.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X. THE SOUND OF BEATING HOOFS\r\n\r\nOn Monday morning Mrs. Atterson put her house in the agent's hands. On\r\nWednesday a pair of spinster ladies came to look at it. They came again\r\non Thursday and again on Friday.\r\n\r\nFriday being considered an “unlucky” day they did not bind the bargain;\r\nbut on Saturday money was passed, and the new keepers of the house were\r\nto take possession in a week. Not until then were the boarders informed\r\nof Mother Atterson's change of circumstances, and the fact that she was\r\ngoing to graduate from the boarding house kitchen to the farm.\r\n\r\nAfter all, they were sorry--those light-headed, irresponsible young\r\nmen. There wasn't one of them, from Crackit down the line, who could\r\nnot easily remember some special kindness that marked the old lady's\r\nintercourse with him.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the fact was announced that the boarding house had changed\r\nhands, the boarders were up in arms. There was a wild gabble of voices,\r\nover the supper table that night. Crackit led the chorus.\r\n\r\n“It's a mean trick. Mother Atterson has sold us like so many cattle to\r\nthe highest bidder. Ungrateful--right down ungrateful, I call it,” he\r\ndeclared. “What do you say, Feeble?”\r\n\r\n“It is particularly distasteful to me just now,” complained the invalid.\r\n“When Sister has learned to give me my hot water at just the right\r\ntemperature,” and he took a sip of that innocent beverage. “Don't you\r\nsuppose we could prevail upon the old lady to renig?”\r\n\r\n“She's bound to put us off with half rations for the rest of the time\r\nshe stays,” declared Crackit, shaking his head wisely. “She's got\r\nnothing to lose now. She don't care if we all up and leave--after she\r\ngets hers.”\r\n\r\n“That's always the way,” feebly remarked Mr. Peebles. “Just as soon as I\r\nreally get settled down into a half-decent lodging, something happens.”\r\n\r\nMr. Peebles had been a fixture at Mother Atterson's for nearly ten\r\nyears. Only Old Lem Camp had been longer at the place.\r\n\r\nThe latter was the only boarder who had no adverse criticism for the\r\nmistress's new move. Indeed this evening Mr. Camp said nothing whatever;\r\neven his usual mumblings to himself were not heard.\r\n\r\nHe ate slowly, and but little. He was still sitting at the table when\r\nall the others had departed.\r\n\r\nMrs. Atterson started into the dining-room with her own supper between\r\ntwo plates when she saw the old man sitting there despondent in looks\r\nand attitude, his head resting on one clawlike hand, his elbow on the\r\nsoiled table cloth.\r\n\r\nHe did not look up, nor move. The mistress glanced back over her\r\nshoulder, and there was Sister, sniffling and occasionally rubbing her\r\nwrist into her red eyes as she scraped the tower of plates from the\r\ndinner table.\r\n\r\n“My soul and body!” gasped Mother Atterson, almost dropping her supper\r\non the floor. “There's Sister--and there's Old Lem Camp! Whatever will I\r\ndo with 'em?”\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Hiram Strong had already left for the farm on the Wednesday\r\nprevious. The other boarders knew nothing about his agreement with\r\nMother Atterson; he had agreed to go to the place and begin work, and\r\ntake care of the stock and all, “choring for himself”, as the good lady\r\ncalled it, until she could complete her city affairs and move herself\r\nand her personal chattels to the farm.\r\n\r\nHiram bore a note to the woman who had promised to care for the Atterson\r\nplace, and money to pay her what the boarding-house mistress had agreed.\r\n\r\n“You can 'bach' it in the house as well as poor old Uncle Jeptha did, I\r\nreckon,” this woman told the youth.\r\n\r\nShe showed him where certain provisions were--the pork barrel, ham and\r\nbacon of the old man's curing, and the few vegetables remaining from the\r\nwinter's store.\r\n\r\n“The cow was about gone dry, anyway,” said the woman, Mrs. Larriper, who\r\nwas a widow and lived with her married daughter some half-mile down the\r\nroad toward Scoville, “so I didn't bother to milk her.\r\n\r\n“You'll have to go to town to buy grain, if you want to feed her up--and\r\nfor the chickens and the horse. The old man didn't make much of a crop\r\nlast year--or them shiftless Dickersons didn't make much for him.\r\n\r\n“I saw Sam Dickerson around here this morning. He borrowed some of the\r\nold man's tools when Uncle Jeptha was sick, and you'll have to go after\r\n'em, I reckon.\r\n\r\n“Sam's the best borrower that ever was; but he never can remember to\r\nbring things back. He says it's bad enough to have to borrow; it's too\r\nmuch to expect the same man to return what he borrows.\r\n\r\n“Now, Mrs. Dickerson,” pursued Mrs. Larriper, “was as nice a girl before\r\nshe married--she was a Stepney--as ever walked in shoe-leather. And I\r\nguess she'd be right friendly with the neighbors if Sam would let her.\r\n\r\n“But the poor thing never gits to go out--no, sir! She's jest tied to\r\nthe house. They lost a child once--four year ago. That's the only time\r\nI remember of seeing Sarah Stepney in church since the day she was\r\nmarried--and she's got a boy--Pete--as old as you be.\r\n\r\n“Now, on the other side o' ye there's Darrell's tract, and you won't\r\nhave no trouble there, for there ain't a house on his place, and he lets\r\nit lie idle. Waiting for a rise in price, I 'spect.\r\n\r\n“Some rich folks is comin' in and buying up pieces of land and making\r\nwhat they calls 'gentlemen's estates' out o' them. A family named\r\nBronson--Mr. Stephen Bronson, with one little girl--bought the Fleigler\r\nplace only last month.\r\n\r\n“They're nice folks,” pursued this amiable but talkative lady, “and\r\nthey don't live but a mile or so along the Scoville road. You passed the\r\nplace--white, with green shutters, and a water-tower in the back, when\r\nyou walked up.”\r\n\r\n“I remember it,” said Hiram, nodding.\r\n\r\n“They're western folk. Come clear from out in Injiany, or Illiny, or\r\nthe like. The girl's going to school and she ain't got no mother, so her\r\nfather's come on East with her to be near the school.\r\n\r\n“Well, I can't help you no more. Them hens! Well, I'd sell 'em if I was\r\nMis' Atterson.\r\n\r\n“Hens ain't much nowadays, anyhow; and I expect a good many of those are\r\ntoo old to lay. Uncle Jeptha couldn't fuss with chickens, and he didn't\r\nraise only a smitch of 'em last year and the year before--just them that\r\nthe hens hatched themselves in stolen nests, and chanced to bring up\r\nalive.\r\n\r\n“You better grease the cart before you use it. It's stood since they\r\nhauled in corn last fall.\r\n\r\n“And look out for Dickerson. Ask him for the things he borrowed. You'll\r\nneed 'em, p'r'aps, if you're goin' to do any farmin' for Mis' Atterson.”\r\n\r\nShe bustled away. Hiram thought he had heard enough about his neighbors\r\nfor a while, and he went out to look over the pasture fencing, which was\r\nto be his first repair job. He would have that ready to turn the cow and\r\nher calf into as soon as the grass began to grow.\r\n\r\nHe rummaged about in what had been half woodshed and half workshop\r\nin Uncle Jeptha's time, and found a heavy claw-hammer, a pair of wire\r\ncutters, and a pocket full of fence staples.\r\n\r\nWith this outfit he prepared to follow the line fence, which was\r\nlikewise the pasture fence on the west side, between Mrs. Atterson's and\r\nDickerson's.\r\n\r\nWhere he could, he mended the broken strands of wire. In other places\r\nthe wires had sagged and were loose. The claw-hammer fixed these like\r\na charm. Slipping the wire into the claw, a single twist of the wrist\r\nwould usually pick up the sag and make the wire taut again at that\r\npoint.\r\n\r\nHe drove a few staples, as needed, as he walked along. The pasture\r\npartook of the general conformation of the farm--it was rather long and\r\nnarrow.\r\n\r\nIt had grown to clumps of bushes in spots, and there was sufficient\r\nshade. But he did not come to the water until he reached the lower end\r\nof the lot.\r\n\r\nThe branch trickled from a spring, or springs, farther east. It made\r\nan elbow at the corner of the pasture--the lower south-west corner--and\r\nthere a water-hole had been scooped out at some past time.\r\n\r\nThis waterhole was deep enough for all purposes, and was shaded by a\r\ngreat oak that had stood there long before the house belonging to Jeptha\r\nAtterson had been built.\r\n\r\nHere Hiram struck something that puzzled him. The boundary fence crossed\r\nthis water-hole at a tangent, and recrossed to the west bank of the\r\noutflowing branch a few yards below, leaving perhaps half of the\r\nwater-hole upon the neighbor's side of the fence.\r\n\r\nSome of this wire at the water-hole was practically new. So were the\r\nposts. And after a little Hiram traced the line of old postholes which\r\nhad followed a straight line on the west side of the water-hole.\r\n\r\nIn other words, this water-privilege for Dickerson's land was of recent\r\narrangement--so recent indeed, that the young farmer believed he could\r\nsee some fresh-turned earth about the newly-set posts.\r\n\r\n“That's something to be looked into, I am afraid,” thought Hiram, as he\r\nmoved along the southern pasture fence.\r\n\r\nBut the trickle of the branch beckoned him; he had not found the\r\nfountain-head of the little stream when he had walked over a part of the\r\ntimbered land with Henry Pollock, and now he struck into the open woods\r\nagain, digging into the soil here and there with his heavy boot, marking\r\nthe quality and age of the timber, and casting-up in his mind the\r\npossibilities and expense of clearing these overgrown acres.\r\n\r\n“Mrs. Atterson may have a very valuable piece of land here in time,”\r\n muttered Hiram. “A sawmill set up in here could cut many a hundred\r\nthousand feet of lumber--and good lumber, too. But it would spoil the\r\nbeauty of the farm.”\r\n\r\nHowever, as must ever be in the case of the utility farm, the house was\r\nset on its ugliest part. The cleared fields along the road had nothing\r\nbut the background of woods on the south and east to relieve their\r\nmonotony.\r\n\r\nOn the brow of the steeper descent, which he had noted on his former\r\nvisit to the back end of the farm, he found a certain clearing in the\r\nwood. Here the pines surrounded the opening on three sides.\r\n\r\nTo the south, through a break in the wooded hillside, he obtained a\r\nfar-reaching view of the river valley as it lay, to the east and to the\r\nwest. The prospect was delightful.\r\n\r\nHere and there, on the farther bank of the river, which rose less\r\nabruptly there than on this side, lay several cheerful looking\r\nfarmsteads. The white dwellings and outbuildings dotted the checkered\r\nfields of green and brown.\r\n\r\nCowbells tinkled in the distance, for the weather tempted farmers to let\r\ntheir cattle run in the pastures even so early in the season. A horse\r\nwhinnied shrilly to a mate in a distant field.\r\n\r\nThe creaking of the heavy wheels of a laden farm-cart was a mellow sound\r\nin Hiram's ears. Beyond a fir plantation, high on the hillside, the\r\nsharply outlined steeple of a little church lay against the soft blue\r\nhorizon.\r\n\r\n“A beauty-spot!” Hiram muttered. “What a site for a home! And yet people\r\nwant to build their houses right on an automobile road, and in sight of\r\nthe rural mail box!”\r\n\r\nHis imagination began to riot, spurred by the outlook and by the nearer\r\nprospect of wood and hillside. The sun now lay warmly upon him as he sat\r\nupon a stump and drank in the beauty of it all.\r\n\r\nAfter a time his ear, becoming attuned to the multitudinous voices\r\nof the wood, descried the silvery note of falling water. He arose and\r\ntraced the sound.\r\n\r\nLess than twenty yards away, and not far from the bluff, a vigorous\r\nrivulet started from beneath the half-bared roots of a monster beech,\r\nand fell over an outcropping boulder into a pool so clear that sand\r\non its bottom, worked mysteriously into a pattern by the action of the\r\nwater, lay revealed.\r\n\r\nHiram knelt on a mossy rock beside the pool, and bending put his lips\r\nto the water. It was the sweetest, most satisfying drink, he had imbibed\r\nfor many a day.\r\n\r\nBut the morning was growing old, and Hiram wanted to trace the farther\r\nline of the farm. He went down to the river, crossed the open meadow\r\nagain where they had built the campfire the morning before, and found\r\nthe deeply scarred oak which stood exactly on the boundary line between\r\nthe Atterson and Darrell tracts.\r\n\r\nHe turned to the north, and followed the line as nearly as might be. The\r\nDarrell tract was entirely wooded, and when he reached the uplands\r\nhe kept on in the shadowy aisles of the sap-pines which covered his\r\nneighbor's property.\r\n\r\nHe came finally to where the ground fell away again, and the yellow,\r\ndeeply-rutted road lay at his feet. The winter had played havoc with the\r\nautomobile track.\r\n\r\nThe highway was unfenced and the bank dropped fifteen feet to the beaten\r\npath. A leaning oak overhung the road and Hiram lingered here, lying\r\non its broad trunk, face upward, with his hat pulled over his eyes to\r\nshield them from the sunlight which filtered through the branches.\r\n\r\nThis land hereabout was beautiful. The boy could appreciate the beauty\r\nas well as the utility of the soil. It was so pleasing to the eye that\r\nhe wished with all his heart it had been his own land he had surveyed.\r\n\r\n“And I'll not be a tenant farmer all my life, nor a farm-foreman, as\r\nfather was,” determined the boy. “I'll get ahead. If I work for the\r\nbenefit of other people for a few years, surely I'll win the chance in\r\ntime to at last work for myself.”\r\n\r\nIn the midst of his ruminations a sound broke upon his ear--a jarring\r\nnote in the peaceful murmur of the woodland life. It was the thud of a\r\nhorse's hoofs.\r\n\r\nNot the sedate tunk-tunk of iron-shod feet on the damp earth, but\r\nan erratic and rapid pounding of hoof-beats which came on with such\r\nstartling swiftness that Hiram sat up instantly, and craned his neck to\r\nsee up the road.\r\n\r\n“That horse is running away!” gasped the young farmer, and he swung\r\nhimself out upon the lowest branch of the leaning tree which overhung\r\nthe carttrack, the better to see along the highway.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI. A GIRL RIDES INTO THE TALE\r\n\r\nThere was no bend in the highway for some distance, but the overhanging\r\ntrees masked the track completely, save for a few hundred yards. The\r\nhorse, whether driven or running at large, was plainly spurred by\r\nfright.\r\n\r\nInto the peacefulness of this place its hoof-beats were bringing the\r\nelement of peril.\r\n\r\nLying prostrate on the sloping trunk, Hiram could see much farther up\r\nthe road. The outstretched head and lathered breast of a tall bay horse\r\nleaped into view, and like a picture in a kinetoscope, growing larger\r\nand more vivid second by second, the maddened animal came down the road.\r\n\r\nHiram could see that the beast was not riderless, but it was a moment\r\nor two--a long-drawn, anxious space of heart-beaten seconds--ere he\r\nrealized what manner of rider it was who clung so desperately to the\r\nmasterless creature.\r\n\r\n“It's a girl--a little girl!” gasped Hiram.\r\n\r\nShe was only a speck of color, with white, drawn face, on the back of\r\nthe racing horse.\r\n\r\nEvery plunge of the oncoming animal shook the little figure as though\r\nit must fall from the saddle. But Hiram could see that she hung with\r\nphenomenal pluck to the broken bridle and to the single horn of her\r\nside-saddle.\r\n\r\nIf the horse fell, or if she were shaken free, she would be flung to\r\ninstant death, or be fearfully bruised under the pounding hoofs of the\r\nbig horse.\r\n\r\nThe young farmer's appreciation of the peril was instant; unused as he\r\nwas to meeting such emergency, there was neither panic nor hesitancy in\r\nhis actions.\r\n\r\nHe writhed farther out upon the limb of the leaning oak until he was\r\ndirect above the road. The big bay naturally kept to the middle, for\r\nthere was no obstruction in its path.\r\n\r\nTo have dropped to the highway would have put Hiram to instant\r\ndisadvantage; for before he could have recovered himself after the drop\r\nthe horse would have been upon him.\r\n\r\nNow, swinging with both legs wrapped around the tough limb, and his left\r\nhand gripping a smaller branch, but with his back to the plunging brute,\r\nthe youth glanced under his right armpit to judge the distance and the\r\non-rush of the horse and its helpless rider.\r\n\r\nHe knew she saw him. Swift as was the steed's approach, Hiram had seen\r\nthe change come into the expression of the girl's face.\r\n\r\n“Clear your foot of the stirrup!” he shouted, hoping the girl would\r\nunderstand.\r\n\r\nWith a confusing thunder of hoofbeats the bay came on--was beneath\r\nhim--had passed!\r\n\r\nHiram's right arm shot out, curved slightly, and as his fingers gripped\r\nher sleeve, the girl let go. She was whisked out of the saddle and the\r\nhorse swept on without her.\r\n\r\nThe strain of the girl's slight weight upon his arm lasted but a moment,\r\nfor Hiram let go with his feet, swung down, and dropped.\r\n\r\nThey alighted in the roadway with so slight a jar that he scarcely\r\nstaggered, but set the girl down gently, and for the passing of a breath\r\nher body swayed against him, seeking support.\r\n\r\nThen she sprang a little away, and they stood looking at each\r\nother--Hiram panting and flushed, the girl with wide-open eyes out of\r\nwhich the terror had not yet faded, and cheeks still colorless.\r\n\r\nSo they stood, for fully half a minute, speechless, while the thunder of\r\nthe bay's hoofs passed further and further away and finally was lost in\r\nthe distance.\r\n\r\nAnd it wasn't excitement that kept the boy dumb; for that was all over,\r\nand he had been as cool as need be through the incident. But it\r\nwas unbounded amazement that made him stare so at the slight girl\r\nconfronting him.\r\n\r\nHe had seen her brilliant, dark little face before. Only once--but that\r\none occasion had served to photograph her features on his memory.\r\n\r\nFor the second time he had been of service to her; but he knew\r\ninstantly--and the fact did not puzzle him--that she did not recognize\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nIt had been so dark in the unlighted side street back in Crawberry the\r\nevening of their first meeting that Hiram believed (and was glad) that\r\nneither she nor her father would recognize him as the boy who had kept\r\ntheir carriage from going into the open ditch.\r\n\r\nAnd he had played rescuer again--and in a much more heroic manner.\r\nThis was the daughter of the man whom he had thought to be a prosperous\r\nfarmer, and whose card Hiram had lost.\r\n\r\nHe had hoped the gentleman might have a job for him; but now Hiram was\r\nnot looking for a job. He had given himself heartily to the project of\r\nmaking the old Atterson farm pay; nor was he the sort of fellow to show\r\nfickleness in such a project.\r\n\r\nBefore either Hiram or the girl broke the silence--before that silence\r\ncould become awkward, indeed--there started into hearing the ring of\r\nrapid hoofbeats again. But it was not the runaway returning.\r\n\r\nThe mate of the latter appeared, and he came jogging along the road,\r\nvery much in hand, the rider seemingly quite unflurried.\r\n\r\nThis was a big, ungainly, beak-nosed boy, whose sleeves were much too\r\nshort, and trousers-legs likewise, to hide Nature's abundant gift to him\r\nin the matter of bone and knuckle. He was freckled and wore a grin that\r\nwas not even sheepish.\r\n\r\nSomehow, this stolidity and inappreciation of the peril the girl had so\r\nrecently escaped, made Hiram feel sudden indignation.\r\n\r\nBut the girl herself took the lout to task--before Hiram could say a\r\nword.\r\n\r\n“I told you that horse could not bear the whip, Peter!” she exclaimed,\r\nwith wrathful gaze. “How dared you strike him?”\r\n\r\n“Aw--I only touched him up a bit,” drawled the youth. “You said you\r\ncould ride anything, didn't you?” and his grin grew wider. “But I see ye\r\nhad to get off.”\r\n\r\nHere Hiram could stand it no longer, and he blurted out:\r\n\r\n“She might have been killed! I believe that horse is running yet----”\r\n\r\n“Well, why didn't you stop it?” demanded the other youth, “impudently.\r\nYou had a chance.”\r\n\r\n“He saved me,” cried the girl, looking at Hiram now with shining eyes.\r\n“I don't know how to thank him.”\r\n\r\n“He might have stopped the horse while he was about it,” growled the\r\nfellow, picking up his own reins again. “Now I'll have to ride after\r\nit.”\r\n\r\n“You'd better,” said the little lady, sharply. “If father knew that\r\nhorse had run away with me he would be dreadfully put out. You hurry\r\nafter him, Peter.”\r\n\r\nThe lout never said a word in reply, but his horse carried him swiftly\r\nout of sight in the wake of the runaway. Then the girl turned again to\r\nHiram and the young farmer knew that he was being keenly examined by her\r\nbright black eyes.\r\n\r\n“I am very sure father will not keep him,” declared the girl, looking at\r\nHiram thoughtfully. “He is too careless--and I don't like him, anyway.\r\nDo you live around here?”\r\n\r\n“I expect to,” replied Hiram, smiling. “I have just come. I am going to\r\nstay at this next house, along the road.”\r\n\r\n“Oh! where the old gentleman died last week?”\r\n\r\n“Yes. Mrs. Atterson was left the place by her uncle, and I am going to\r\nrun it for her.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, dear! then you've got a place to work?” queried the little lady,\r\nwith plain disappointment in her tone. “I am sure father would like to\r\nhave you instead of Peter.”\r\n\r\nBut Hiram shook his head slowly, though still smiling,\r\n\r\n“I'm obliged to you,” he said; “but I have agreed to stop with Mrs.\r\nAtterson for a time.”\r\n\r\n“I want father to meet you just the same,” she declared.\r\n\r\nShe had a way about her that impressed Hiram with the idea that she\r\nseldom failed in getting what she wanted. If she was not a spoiled\r\nchild, she certainly was a very much indulged one.\r\n\r\nBut she was pretty! Dark, petite, with a brilliant smile, flashing\r\neyes, and a riot of blue-black curls, she was verily the daintiest and\r\nprettiest little creature the young farmer had ever seen.\r\n\r\n“I am Lettie Bronson,” she said, frankly. “I live down the road toward\r\nScoville. We have only just come here.”\r\n\r\n“I know where you live,” said Hiram, smiling and nodding.\r\n\r\n“You must come and see us. I want you to know father. He's the very\r\nnicest man there is, I think.”\r\n\r\n“He came all the way East here so as to live near my school--I go to the\r\nSt. Beris school in Scoville. It's awfully nice, and the girls are very\r\nfashionable; but I'd be too lonely to live if daddy wasn't right near me\r\nall the time.\r\n\r\n“What is your name?” she asked suddenly.\r\n\r\nHiram told her.\r\n\r\n“Why! that's a regular farmer's name, isn't it--Hiram?” and she\r\nlaughed--a clear and sweet sound, that made an inquisitive squirrel that\r\nhad been watching them scamper away to his hollow, chattering.\r\n\r\n“I don't know about that,” returned the young farmer, shaking his\r\nhead and smiling. “I ought by good rights to be 'a worker in brass',\r\naccording to the Bible. That was the trade of Hiram, of the tribe of\r\nNaphtali, who came out of Tyre to make all the brass work for Solomon's\r\ntemple.”\r\n\r\n“Oh! and there was a King Hiram, of Tyre, too, wasn't there,” cried\r\nLettie, laughing. “You might be a king, you know.”\r\n\r\n“That seems to be an unprofitable trade now-a-days,” returned the young\r\nfellow, shaking his head. “I think I will be the namesake of Hiram, the\r\nbrass-smith, for it is said of him that he was 'filled with wisdom and\r\nunderstanding' and that is what I want to be if I am going to run Mrs.\r\nAtterson's farm and make it pay.”\r\n\r\n“You're a funny boy,” said the girl, eyeing him furiously.\r\n“You're--you're not at all like Pete--or these other boys about\r\nScoville.”\r\n\r\n“And that Pete Dickerson isn't any good at all! I shall tell daddy all\r\nabout how he touched up that horse and made him run. Here he comes now!”\r\n\r\nThey had been walking steadily along the road toward the Atterson house,\r\nand in the direction the runaway had taken. Pete Dickerson appeared,\r\nriding one of the bays and leading the one that had been frightened.\r\n\r\nThe latter was all of a lather, was blowing hard, and before the horses\r\nreached them, Hiram saw that the runaway was in bad shape.\r\n\r\n“Hold on!” he cried to the lout. “Breathe that horse a while. Let him\r\nstand. He ought to be rubbed down, too. Don't you see the shape he is\r\nin?”\r\n\r\n“Aw, what's eatin' you?” demanded Pete, eyeing the speaker with much\r\ndisfavor.\r\n\r\nThe horse, when he stopped, was trembling all over. His nostrils were\r\ndilated and as red as blood, and strings of foam were dripping from his\r\nbit.\r\n\r\n“Don't let him stand there in the shade,” spoke Hiram, more “mildly.\r\nHe'll take a chill. Here! let me have him.”\r\n\r\nHe approached the still frightened horse, and Pete jerked the\r\nbridle-rein. The horse started back and snorted.\r\n\r\n“Stand 'round there, ye 'tarnal nuisance!” exclaimed Pete.\r\n\r\nBut Hiram caught the bridle and snatched it from the other fellow's\r\nhand.\r\n\r\n“Just let me manage him a minute,” said Hiram, leading the horse into\r\nthe sunshine.\r\n\r\nHe patted him, and soothed him, and the horse ceased trembling and his\r\nears pricked up. Hiram, still keeping the reins in his hand, loosened\r\nthe cinches and eased the saddle so that the animal could breathe\r\nbetter.\r\n\r\nThere were bunches of dried sage-grass growing by the roadside, and the\r\nyoung farmer tore off a couple of these bunches and used them to wipe\r\ndown the horse's legs. Pretty soon the creature forgot his fright and\r\nlooked like a normal horse again.\r\n\r\n“If he was mine I'd give him whip a-plenty--till he learned better,”\r\n drawled Pete Dickerson, finally.\r\n\r\n“Don't you ever dare touch him with the whip again!” cried the girl,\r\nstamping her foot. “He will not stand it. You were told----”\r\n\r\n“Aw, well,” said the fellow, “'I didn't think he was going to cut up as\r\nbad as that. These Western horses ain't more'n half broke, anyway.”\r\n\r\n“I think he is perfectly safe for you to ride now, Miss Bronson,” said\r\nHiram, quietly. “I'll give you a hand up. But walk him home, please.”\r\n\r\nHe had tightened the cinches again. Lettie put her tiny booted foot in\r\nhis hand (she wore a very pretty dark green habit) and with perfect ease\r\nthe young farmer lifted her into the saddle.\r\n\r\n“Good-bye--and thank you again!” she said, softly, giving him her free\r\nhand just as the horse started.\r\n\r\n“Say! you're the fellow who's going to live at Atterson's place?”\r\n observed Pete. “I'll see you later,” and he waved his hand airily as he\r\nrode off.\r\n\r\n“So that's Pete Dickerson, is it?” ruminated Hiram, as he watched the\r\nhorses out of sight. “Well, if his father, Sam, is anything like him, we\r\ncertainly have got a sweet pair of neighbors!”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII. SOMETHING ABOUT A PASTURE FENCE\r\n\r\nThat afternoon Hiram hitched up the old horse and drove into town.\r\n\r\nHe went to see the lawyer who had transacted Uncle Jeptha Atterson's\r\nsmall business in the old man's lifetime, and had made his will--Mr.\r\nStrickland. Hiram judged that this gentleman would know as much about\r\nthe Atterson place as anybody.\r\n\r\n“No--Mr. Atterson never said anything to me about giving a neighbor\r\nwater-rights,” the lawyer said. “Indeed, Mr. Atterson was not a man\r\nlikely to give anything away--until he had got through with it himself.\r\n\r\n“Dickerson once tried to buy a right at that corner of the Atterson\r\npasture; but he and the old gentleman couldn't come to terms.\r\n\r\n“Dickerson has no water on his place, saving his well and his rights on\r\nthe river. It makes it bad for him, I suppose; but I do not advise Mrs.\r\nAtterson to let that fence stand. Give that sort of a man an inch and\r\nhe'll take a mile.”\r\n\r\n“But what shall I do?”\r\n\r\n“That's professional advice, young man,” returned the lawyer, “smiling.\r\nBut I will give it to you without charge.\r\n\r\n“Merely go and pull the new posts up and replace them on the line. If\r\nDickerson interferes with you, come to me and we'll have him bound over\r\nbefore the Justice of the Peace.\r\n\r\n“You represent Mrs. Atterson and are within her rights. That's the best\r\nI can tell you.”\r\n\r\nNow, Hiram was not desirous of starting any trouble--legal or\r\notherwise--with a neighbor; but neither did he wish to see anybody take\r\nadvantage of his old boarding mistress. He knew that, beside farming\r\nfor her, he would probably have to defend her from many petty annoyances\r\nlike the present case.\r\n\r\nSo he bought the wire he needed for repairs, a few other things that\r\nwere necessary, and drove back to the farm, determined to go right ahead\r\nand await the consequences.\r\n\r\nAmong his purchases was an axe. In the workshop on the farm was a fairly\r\ngood grindstone; only the treadle was broken and Hiram had to repair\r\nthis before he could make much headway in grinding the axe. Henry\r\nPollock lived too far away to be called upon in such a small emergency.\r\n\r\nBeing obliged to work alone sharpens one's wits. The young farmer had to\r\nresort to shifts and expedients on every hand, as he went along.\r\n\r\nThe day before, while wandering in the wood, he had marked several white\r\noaks of the right size for posts. He would have preferred cedars, of\r\ncourse; but those trees were scarce on the Atterson tract--and they\r\nmight be needed for some more important job later on.\r\n\r\nWhen he came up to the house at noon to feed the stock and make his own\r\nfrugal meal in the farm house kitchen, the posts were cut. After dinner\r\nhe harnessed the horse to the farm wagon, and went down for the posts,\r\ntaking the rolls of wire along to drop beside the fence.\r\n\r\nThe horse was a steady, willing creature, and seemed to have no tricks.\r\nHe did not drive very well on the road, of course; but that wasn't what\r\nthey needed a horse for.\r\n\r\nDriving was a secondary matter.\r\n\r\nHiram loaded his posts and hauled them to the pasture, driving inside\r\nthe fence line and dropping a post wherever one had rotted out.\r\n\r\nYet posts that had rotted at the ground were not so easy to draw out, as\r\nthe young farmer very well knew, and he set his wits to work to make the\r\nremoval of the old posts easy of accomplishment.\r\n\r\nHe found an old, but strong, carpenter's horse in the shed, to act as\r\na fulcrum, and a seasoned bar of hickory as a lever. There was never\r\nan old farm yet that didn't have a useful heap of junk, and Hiram had\r\nalready scratched over Uncle Jeptha's collection of many years' standng.\r\n\r\nHe found what he sought in a wrought iron band some half inch in\r\nthickness with a heavy hook attached to it by a single strong link.\r\nHe fitted this band upon the larger end of the hickory bar, wedging it\r\ntightly into place.\r\n\r\nA short length of trace chain completed his simple post-puller. And he\r\ncould easily carry the outfit from place to place as it was needed.\r\n\r\nWhen he found a weak or rotting post, he pulled the staples that held\r\nthe strands of wire to it and and then set the trestle alongside the\r\npost. Resting the lever on the trestle, he dropped the end link of the\r\nchain on the hook, looped the chain around the post, and hooked on with\r\nanother link. Bearing down on the lever brought the post out of the\r\nground every time.\r\n\r\nWith a long-handled spade Hiram cleaned out the old holes, or enlarged\r\nthem, and set his new posts, one after the other. He left the wires to\r\nbe tightened and stapled later.\r\n\r\nIt was not until the next afternoon that he worked down as far as the\r\nwater-hole. Meanwhile he had seen nothing of the neighbors and neither\r\nknew, nor cared, whether they were watching him or not.\r\n\r\nBut it was evident that the Dickersons had kept tabs on the young\r\nfarmer's progress, for, he had no more than pulled the posts out of\r\nthe water-hole and started to reset them on the proper line, than the\r\nlong-legged Pete Dickerson appeared.\r\n\r\n“Hey, you!” shouted Pete. “What are you monkeying with that line fence\r\nfor?”\r\n\r\n“Because I won't have time to fix it later,” responded Hiram, calmly.\r\n\r\n“Fresh Ike, ain't yer?” demanded young Dickerson.\r\n\r\nHe was half a head taller than Hiram, and plainly felt himself safe in\r\nadopting bullying tactics.\r\n\r\n“You put them posts back where you found 'em and string the wires again\r\nin a hurry--or I'll make yer.”\r\n\r\n“This is Mrs. Atterson's fence,” said Hiram, quietly. “I have made\r\ninquiries about the line, and I know where it belongs.”\r\n\r\n“No part of this water-hole belongs on your side of the fence,\r\nDickerson, and as long as I represent Mrs. Atterson it's not going to be\r\ngrabbed.”\r\n\r\n“Say! the old man gave my father the right to a part of this hole long\r\nago.”\r\n\r\n“Show your legal paper to that effect,” promptly suggested Hiram. “Then\r\nwe will let it stand until the lawyers decide the matter.”\r\n\r\nPete was silent for a minute; meanwhile Hiram continued to dig his hole,\r\nand finally set the first post into place.\r\n\r\n“I tell you to take that post out o' there, Mister,” exclaimed Pete,\r\nsuddenly approaching the other. “I don't like you, anyway. You helped\r\ngit me turned off up there to Bronson's yesterday. If you wouldn't have\r\nput your fresh mouth in about the horse that gal wouldn't have knowed\r\nso much to tell her father. Now you stop foolin' with this fence or I'll\r\nlick you.”\r\n\r\nHiram Strong's disposition was far from being quarrelsome. He only\r\nlaughed at first and said:\r\n\r\n“Why, that won't do you any good in the end, Peter. Thrashing me won't\r\ngive you and your father the right to usurp rights at this water-hole.\r\n\r\n“There was very good reason, as I can see, for old Mr. Atterson refusing\r\nto let you water your stock here. In time of drouth the branch probably\r\nfurnished no more water than his own cattle needed. And it will be the\r\nsame with my employer.”\r\n\r\n“You'd better have less talk about it, and set back them posts,”\r\n declared Pete, decidedly, laying off his coat and pulling up his shirt\r\nsleeves.\r\n\r\n“I hope you won't try anything foolish, Peter,” said Hiram, resting on\r\nhis shovel handle.\r\n\r\n“Huh!” grunted Pete, eyeing him sideways as might an evil-disposed dog.\r\n\r\n“We're not well matched,” observed Hiram, quietly, “and whether you\r\nthrashed me, or I thrashed you, nothing would be proved by it in regard\r\nto the line fence.”\r\n\r\n“I'll show you what I can prove!” cried Pete, and rushed for him.\r\n\r\nIn a catch-as-catch-can wrestle Pete Dickerson might have been able\r\nto overturn Hiram Strong. But the latter did not propose to give the\r\nlong-armed youth that advantage.\r\n\r\nHe dropped the spade, stepped nimbly aside, and as Pete lunged past\r\nhim the young farmer doubled his fist and struck his antagonist solidly\r\nunder the ear.\r\n\r\nThat was the only blow struck--that and the one when Pete struck the\r\nground. The bigger fellow rolled over, grunted, and gazed up at Hiram\r\nwith amazement struggling with the rage expressed in his features.\r\n\r\n“I told you we were not well matched, Peter,” spoke Hiram, calmly. “Why\r\nfight about it? You have no right on your side, and I do not propose to\r\nsee Mrs. Atterson robbed of this water privilege.”\r\n\r\nPete climbed to his feet slowly, and picked up his coat. He felt of his\r\nneck carefully and then looked at his hand, with the idea evidently that\r\nsuch a heavy blow must have brought blood. But of course there was none.\r\n\r\n“I'll tell my dad--that's what I'll do,” ejaculated the bully, at\r\nlength, and he started immediately across the field, his long legs\r\nworking like a pair of tongs in his haste to get over the ground.\r\n\r\nBut Hiram completed the setting of the posts at the water-hole without\r\nhearing further from any member of the Dickerson family.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII. THE UPROOTING\r\n\r\nThese early Spring days were busy ones for Hiram Strong. The mornings\r\nwere frosty and he could not get to his fencing work until midforenoon.\r\nBut there were plenty of other tasks ready to his hand.\r\n\r\nThere were two south windows in the farmhouse kitchen. He tried to keep\r\nsome fire in the stove there day and night, sleeping as he did in Uncle\r\nJeptha's old bedroom nearby.\r\n\r\nBefore these two windows he erected wide shelves and on these he set\r\nshallow boxes of rich earth which he had prepared under the cart shed.\r\nThere was no frost under there, the earth was dry and the hens had\r\nscratched in it during the winter, so Hiram got all the well-sifted\r\nearth he needed for his seed boxes.\r\n\r\nHe used a very little commercial fertilizer in each box, and planted\r\nsome of the seeds he had bought in Crawberry at an agricultural\r\nwarehouse on Main Street.\r\n\r\nMrs. Atterson had expressed the hope that he would put in a variety of\r\nvegetables for their own use, and Hiram had followed her wishes. When\r\nthe earth in the boxes had warmed up for several days he put in the\r\nlong-germinating seeds, like tomato, onions, the salads, leek, celery,\r\npepper, eggplant, and some beet seed to transplant for the early garden.\r\nIt was too early yet to put in cabbage and cauliflower.\r\n\r\nThese boxes caught the sun for a good part of the day. In the afternoon\r\nwhen the sun had gone, Hiram covered the boxes with old quilts and did\r\nnot uncover them again until the sun shone in the next morning. He had\r\ndecided to start his early plants in this way because he hadn't the time\r\nat present to build frames outside.\r\n\r\nDuring the early mornings and late afternoons, too, he began to make the\r\nsmall repairs around the house and outbuildings. Hiram was handy with\r\ntools; indeed, a true farmer should be a good mechanic as well. He must\r\noften combine carpentry and wheelwrighting and work at the forge, with\r\nhis agricultural pursuits. Hiram was something better than a “cold-iron\r\nblacksmith.”\r\n\r\nWhen it came to stretching the wire of the pasture fence he had to\r\nresort to his inventive powers. There are plenty of wire stretchers that\r\ncan be purchased; but they cost money.\r\n\r\nThe young farmer knew that Mrs. Atterson had no money to waste, and he\r\nworked for her just as he would have worked for himself.\r\n\r\nOne man working alone cannot easily stretch wire and make a good job\r\nof it without some mechanism to help him. Hiram's was simple and easily\r\nmade.\r\n\r\nA twelve-inch section of perfectly round post, seven or eight inches\r\nthrough, served as the drum around which to wind the wire, and two\r\ntwenty-penny nails driven into the side of the drum, close together,\r\nwere sufficient to prevent the wire from slipping.\r\n\r\nTo either end of the drum Hiram passed two lengths of Number 9 wire\r\nthrough large screweyes, making a double loop into which the hook of a\r\nlight timber chain would easily catch. Into one end of the drum he drove\r\na headless spike, upon which the hand-crank of the grindstone fitted,\r\nand was wedged tight.\r\n\r\nIn using this ingenious wire stretcher, he stapled his wire to post\r\nnumber one, carried the length past post number two, looped the chain\r\naround post number three, having the chain long enough so that he might\r\ntauten the wire and hold the crankhandle steady with his knee or left\r\narm while he drove the holding staple in post number two. And so repeat,\r\nad infinitum.\r\n\r\nAfter he had made this wire-stretcher the young fellow got along\r\nfamously upon his fencing and could soon turn his attention to other\r\nmatters, knowing that the cattle would be perfectly safe in the pasture\r\nfor the coming season.\r\n\r\nThe old posts he collected on the wagon and drew into the dooryard,\r\npiling them beside the woodshed. There was not an overabundant supply\r\nof firewood cut and Hiram realized that Mrs. Atterson would use\r\nconsiderable in her kitchen stove before the next winter, even if she\r\ndid not run a sitting room fire for long this spring.\r\n\r\nUsing a bucksaw is not only a thankless job at any time, but it is no\r\nsaving of time or money. There was a good two-handed saw in the shed and\r\nHiram found a good rat-tail file. With the aid of a home-made saw-holder\r\nand a monkey wrench he sharpened and set this saw and then got Henry\r\nPollock to help him for a day.\r\n\r\nHenry wasn't afraid of work, and the two boys sawed and split the old\r\nand well-seasoned posts, and some other wood, so that Hiram was enabled\r\nto pile several tiers of stove-wood under the shed against the coming of\r\nMrs. Atterson to her farm.\r\n\r\n“If the season wasn't so far advanced, I could cut a lot of wood, draw\r\nit up, and hire a gasoline engine and saw to come on the place and saw\r\nus enough to last a year. I'll do that next winter,” Hiram said.\r\n\r\n“That's what we all ought to do,” agreed his friend.\r\n\r\nHenry Pollock was an observing farmer's boy and through him Hiram gained\r\nmany pointers as to the way the farmers in that locality put in their\r\ncrops and cultivated them.\r\n\r\nHe learned, too, through Henry who was supposed to be the best farmer\r\nin the neighborhood, who had special success with certain crops, and who\r\nhad raised the best seedcorn in the locality.\r\n\r\nIt was not particularly a trucking community; although, since Scoville\r\nhad begun to grow so fast and many city people had moved into that\r\npleasant town, the local demand for garden produce had increased.\r\n\r\n“It used to be a saying here,” said Henry, “that a bushel of winter\r\nturnips would supply all the needs of Scoville. But that ain't exactly\r\nso now.\r\n\r\n“The stores all want green stuff in season, and are beginning to pay\r\ncash for truck instead of only offering to exchange groceries for the\r\nstuff we raise. I guess if a man understood truck raising he could make\r\nsomething in this market.”\r\n\r\nHiram decided that this was so, on looking over the marketing\r\npossibilities of Scoville.\r\n\r\nThere was a canning factory which put up string beans, corn, and\r\ntomatoes; but the prices per hundred-weight for these commodities did\r\nnot encourage Hiram to advise Mrs. Atterson to try and raise anything\r\nfor the canneries. A profit could not be made out of such crops on a\r\none-horse farm.\r\n\r\nFor instance, the neighboring farmers did not plant their tomato seeds\r\nuntil it was pretty safe to do so in the open ground. The cannery did\r\nnot want the tomato pack to come on until late in August. By that time\r\nthe cream of the prices for garden-grown tomatoes had been skimmed by\r\nthe early truckers.\r\n\r\nThe same with sweet corn and green beans. The cannery demanded these\r\nvegetables at so late a date that the market-price was generally low.\r\n\r\nThese facts Hiram bore in mind as he planned his season's work, and\r\nespecially the kitchen garden. This latter he planned to be about two\r\nacres in extent--rather a large plot, but he proposed to set his rows\r\nof almost every vegetable far enough apart to be worked with a horse\r\ncultivator.\r\n\r\nSome crops--for instance onions, carrots, and other “fine stuff”--must\r\nbe weeded by hand to an extent, and if the soil is rich enough rows\r\ntwelve or fifteen inches apart show better results.\r\n\r\nBetween such rows a wheelhoe can be used to good advantage, and that\r\nwas one tool--with a seed-sowing combination--that Hiram had told Mrs.\r\nAtterson she must buy if he was to practically attend to the whole farm\r\nfor her. Hand-hoeing, in both field and garden crops, is antediluvian.\r\n\r\nThus, during this week and a half of preparation, Hiram made ready for\r\nthe uprooting of Mrs. Atterson from the boarding house in Crawberry to\r\nthe farm some distance out of Scoville.\r\n\r\nThe good lady had but one wagon load of goods to be transferred from\r\nher old quarters to the new home. Many of the articles she brought were\r\nheirlooms which she had stored in the boarding house cellar, or articles\r\nassociated with her happy married life, which had been shortened by her\r\nhusband's death when he was comparatively a young man.\r\n\r\nThese Mrs. Atterson saw piled on the wagon early on Saturday morning,\r\nand she had insisted upon climbing upon the seat beside the driver\r\nherself and riding with him all the way.\r\n\r\nThe boarders gathered on the steps to see her go. The two spinster\r\nladies had already taken possession, and had served breakfast to the\r\ndisgruntled members of Mother Atterson's family.\r\n\r\n“You'll be back again,” prophesied Mr. Crackit, shaking the old lady by\r\nthe hand. “And when you do, just let me know. I'll come and board with\r\nyou.”\r\n\r\n“I wouldn't have you in my house again, Fred Crackit, for two farms,”\r\n declared the ex-boarding house keeper, with asperity.\r\n\r\n“I hope you told these people about my hot water, Mrs. Atterson,”\r\n croaked Mr. Peebles, from the step, where he stood muffled in a shawl\r\nbecause of the raw morning air.\r\n\r\n“If I didn't you can tell 'em yourself,” returned she, with\r\nsatisfaction.\r\n\r\nAnd so it went--the good-byes of these unappreciative boarders selfish\r\nto the last! Mother Atterson sighed--a long, happy, and satisfying\r\nsigh--when the lumbering wagon turned the first corner.\r\n\r\n“Thanks be!” she murmured. “I sha'n't care if they don't have a driblet\r\nof gravy at supper tonight.”\r\n\r\nThen she shook herself and stared straight ahead. On the very next\r\ncorner--she had insisted that none of the other people at the house\r\nshould observe their flitting--stood two figures, both forlorn.\r\n\r\nOld Lem Camp, with a lean suit-case at his feet, and Sister with a\r\nbulging carpetbag which she had brought with her months before from the\r\ncharity institution, and into which she had stuffed everything she owned\r\nin the world.\r\n\r\nTheir faces brightened perceptibly when they beheld Mrs. Atterson\r\nperched high beside the driver on the load of furniture and bedding. The\r\ndriver drew in his span of big horses and the wheels grated against the\r\ncurb.\r\n\r\n“You climb right in behind, Mr. Camp,” said the good lady. “There's room\r\nfor you up under the canvas top--and I had him spread a mattress so't\r\nyou can take it easy all the way, if you like.\r\n\r\n“Sister, you scramble up here and sit in betwixt me and this man. And do\r\nlook out--you're spillin' things out o' that bag like it was a Christmas\r\ncornucopia. Come on, now! Toss it behind us, onto them other things.\r\nThere! we'll go on--and no more stops, I hope, till we reach the farm.”\r\n\r\nBut that couldn't be. It was a long drive, and the man was good to his\r\nteam. He rested them at the top of every hill, and sometimes at the\r\nbottom. They had to stop two hours for dinner and to “breathe 'em,” as\r\nthe man said.\r\n\r\nAt that time Mother Atterson produced a goodsized market basket--her\r\nfamiliar companion when she had hunted bargains in the city--and it was\r\nfilled with sandwiches, and pickles, and crackers, and cookies, and\r\na whole boiled fowl (fowl were cheaper and more satisfying than the\r\nscrawny chickens then in market) and hard-boiled eggs, and cheese, with\r\nnumbers of other less important eatables tucked into corners of the\r\nbasket to “wedge” the larger packages of food.\r\n\r\nThe four picnicked in the sun, with the furniture wagon to break the\r\nkeen wind, passing around hot coffee in a can, from hand to hand, the\r\ndriver having built a campfire to heat the coffee beside the country\r\nroad.\r\n\r\nBut after that stop--for they were well into the country now--there was\r\nno keeping Sister on the wagon-seat. She had learned to drop down and\r\nmount again as lively as a cricket.\r\n\r\nShe tore along the edge of the road, with her hair flying, and her hat\r\nhanging by its ribbons. She chased a rabbit, and squirrels, and picked\r\ncertain green branches, and managed to get her hands and the front of\r\nher dress all “stuck up” with spruce gum in trying to get a piece big\r\nenough to chew.\r\n\r\n“Drat the young'un!” exclaimed Mother Atterson. “I can see plainly\r\nI'd never ought to brought her, but should have sent her back to the\r\ninstitution. She'll be as wild as Mr. March's hare--whoever he was--out\r\nhere in the country.”\r\n\r\nBut Old Lem Camp gave her no trouble. He effaced himself just as he had\r\nat the boarding house supper table. He seldom spoke--never unless he was\r\nspoken to; and he lay up under the roof of the furniture wagon, whether\r\nasleep, or no, Mrs. Atterson could not tell.\r\n\r\n“He's as odd as Dick's hat-band,” the ex-boarding house mistress\r\nconfided to the driver. “But, bless you! the easiest critter to get\r\nalong with--you never saw his beat. If I'd a house full of Lem Camps to\r\ncook for, I'd think I was next door to heaven.”\r\n\r\nIt was dusk when they arrived in sight of the little house beside the\r\nroad in which Uncle Jeptha Atterson had lived out his long life. Hiram\r\nhad a good fire going in both the kitchen and sitting room, and the\r\nlamplight flung through the windows made the place look cheerful indeed\r\nto the travelers.\r\n\r\n“My soul and body!” croaked the good lady, when she got down from the\r\nwagon and Hiram caught her in his arms to save her from a fall. “I'm as\r\nstiff as a poker--and that's a fact. But I'm glad to get here.”\r\n\r\nHiram's amazement when he saw Sister and Old Lem Camp was only expressed\r\nin his look. He said nothing. The driver of the wagon backed it to the\r\nporch step and then took out his team and, with Hiram's help, led them\r\nto the stable, fed them, and bedded them down for the night. He was to\r\nsleep in one of the spare beds and go back to town the following day.\r\n\r\nMother Atterson took off her best dress, slipped into a familiar old\r\ngingham and bustled around the kitchen as naturally as though she had\r\nbeen there all her life.\r\n\r\nShe fried ham and eggs, and made biscuit, and opened a couple of tins of\r\npeaches she had brought, and finally set before them a repast satisfying\r\nif not dainty, and seasoned with a cheerful spirit at least.\r\n\r\n“I vum!” she exclaimed, sitting down for the first time in years “at the\r\nfirst table.” “If this don't beat Crawberry and them boarders, I'm crazy\r\nas a loon. Pour the coffee, Sister--and don't be stingy with the milk.\r\nMilk's only five cents a quart here, and it's eight in town. But,\r\ngracious, child! sugar don't cost no less.”\r\n\r\nOld Lem Camp sat beside Hiram, as he had at the boarding-house table. He\r\nhad scarcely spoken since his arrival; but now, under cover of the talk\r\nof Mother Atterson, the driver of the furniture van, and Sister, he\r\nbegan one of his old-time monologues:\r\n\r\n“Old, old--nothing to look forward to--then the prospect opens up--just\r\nlike light breaking through the clouds after a storm--let's see; I want\r\na piece of bread--bread's on Sister's side--I can reach it--hum! no\r\nCrackit to-night--fool jokes--silly fellow--ah! the butter--Where's the\r\nbutterknife?--Sister's forgotten the butter-knife--no! here 'tis--That\r\nwoman's an angel--nothing less--an angel in a last season's bonnet and a\r\nshabby gown--Hah! practical angels couldn't use wings--they'd be in the\r\nway in the kitchen--ham and eggs--gravy--fit for gods to eat--and not to\r\nworry again where next week's victuals are to come from!”\r\n\r\nHiram noted all the old mail said, and the last phrase enlightened him\r\nimmensely as to why Old Lem Camp was so “queer.” That was the trouble\r\non the old man's mind--the trouble that had stifled him, and made him\r\nappear “half cracked” as the boarding-house jester and Peebles had said.\r\n\r\nLem Camp, too old to ever get another job in the city, had for five\r\nyears been worrying from day to day about his bare existence. And\r\nevidently he saw that bogie of the superannuated disappearing in the\r\ndistance.\r\n\r\nAfter the truck driver had gone to bed, and Camp himself, and Sister had\r\nfallen asleep over the last of the dish-wiping, Mother Atterson confided\r\nin Hiram, to a degree.\r\n\r\n“Now, this gal can be made useful. She can help me in the house, and she\r\ncan help outside, too.\r\n\r\n“She's a poor, unfortunate creature--I know and humbly is no name for\r\nher looks! But mebbe we can send her to the school nearby, and she ought\r\nto get some color in her face if she's out o' doors some--and some flesh\r\non her skinny body.\r\n\r\n“I don't know as I could get along without Sister,” ruminated Mother\r\nAtterson, shaking her head.\r\n\r\n“And as for Lem Camp--bless you! he won't eat more'n a fly, and who else\r\nwould give him houseroom? Why, Hiram, I just had to bring him with me.\r\nIf I hadn't, I'd felt just as conscience-stricken as though I'd moved\r\nand left a cat behind in an empty house!”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV. GETTING IN THE EARLY CROPS\r\n\r\nMother Atterson had breakfast the next morning by lamplight, because the\r\ntruckman wanted to make an early start.\r\n\r\nHiram had already begun early rising, however, for the farmer who does\r\nnot get up before the sun in the spring needs must do his chores at\r\nnight by lantern-light. The eight-hour law can never be a rule on the\r\nfarm.\r\n\r\nBut Sister was up, too, and out of the house, running as wild as a\r\nrabbit. Hiram caught her in the barnyard trying to clamber on the cow's\r\nback to ride her about the enclosure. Sister was afraid of nothing that\r\nlived and walked, having all the courage of ignorance.\r\n\r\nShe found that she could not in safety clamber over the pig-lot fence\r\nand catch one of the shoats. Old Mother Hog ran at her with open mouth\r\nand Sister came back from that expedition with a torn frock and some new\r\nexperience.\r\n\r\n“I never knew anything so fat could run,” she confided to Hiram. “Old\r\nMissus Poundly, who lived on our block, and weighed three hundred\r\npounds, couldn't run, I bet!”\r\n\r\nMr. Camp was not disturbed by Mrs. Atterson, but was allowed to sleep as\r\nlong as he liked, while she kept a little breakfast hot for him and the\r\ncoffeepot on the back of the stove.\r\n\r\nThe old lady became interested at once in all Hiram had done toward\r\nbeginning the spring work. She learned about the seed in the window\r\nboxes (some of them were already breaking the soil) about watering them\r\nand covering them properly and immediately took those duties off Hiram's\r\nhands.\r\n\r\n“If Sister an' me can't do the light chores around this place and leave\r\nyou to 'tend to the bigger things, then we ain't no good and had better\r\ngo back to the boarding house,” she announced.\r\n\r\n“Oh, Mis' Atterson! You wouldn't go back to town, would you?” pleaded\r\nSister. “Why, there's real hens--and a cow that will give milk bimeby,\r\nHi says--and a horse that wiggles his ears and talks right out loud when\r\nhe's hungry, for I heard him--and pigs that squeal and run, an' they're\r\njest as fat as butter----”\r\n\r\n“Well, to stay here we've all got to work, Sister,” declared her\r\nmistress. “So get at them dishes now and be quick about it.\r\nThere's forty times more chores to do here than there was back in\r\nCrawberry--But, thanks be! there ain't no gravy to worry about.”\r\n\r\n“And there ain't no boarders to make fun of me,” said Sister,\r\nthoughtfully. Then, she announced, after some rumination: “I like pigs\r\nbetter than I do boarders Mis' Atterson.”\r\n\r\n“Well, I should think you would!” exclaimed that lady, tartly. “Pigs has\r\ngot some sense.”\r\n\r\nHiram laughed at this. “You'll find the pigs demanding gravy, just the\r\nsame--and very urgent about it they are, too,” he told them.\r\n\r\nBut he was glad to give the small chores over into their hands, and went\r\nto work immediately to prepare for putting in the early crops.\r\n\r\nHe had already cleared the rubbish off the piece of ground selected\r\nfor the garden, and had burned it. He hauled out stable manure from\r\nthe barnyard and gave an acre and a half of this piece of land a good\r\ndressing.\r\n\r\nThe other half-acre was for early potatoes, and he wished to put the\r\nmanure in the furrow for them, so did not top dress that strip of land.\r\nThe frost was pretty well out of the ground by now; but even if some\r\nremained, plowing this high, well-drained piece would do no harm.\r\nBeside, Hiram was eager to get in early crops.\r\n\r\nIt was a still, hazy morning when he geared the old horse to the plow\r\nand headed him into the garden piece. He had determined to plow the\r\nentire plot at once, and instead of plowing “around and around” had\r\npaced off his lands and started in the middle, plowing “gee” instead of\r\n“haw”.\r\n\r\nThis system is a bit more particular, and hard for the careless plowman;\r\nbut it overcomes that unsightly “dead-furrow” in the middle of a field\r\nand brings the “finishing-furrow” on the edge. This insures better\r\nsurface drainage and is a more scientific method of tillage.\r\n\r\nThe plow was rusty and the point was not in the very best condition; but\r\nafter the first few rounds the share was cleaned off, and it began to\r\nslip through the moist earth and roll it over in a long, brown ribbon\r\nbehind him.\r\n\r\nHiram Strong clung to the plow handles, a rope-rein in each hand, and\r\nwatched the plow and the horse and the land ahead with an eye as keen as\r\nthat of a river-pilot.\r\n\r\nAs the strip of turned earth grew wider and longer Sister ran out to see\r\nhim work. She watched the plow turn the mulch into the furrow and lay\r\nthe brown, greasy mold upon it, with wide-open eyes.\r\n\r\n“Why!” cried she, “wouldn't it be nice if we could go right along with\r\na plow and bury our past like that--cover everything mean and nasty\r\nup, and forget it! That institution they put me in--and the old woman\r\nI lived with before that, who drank so much gin and beat me--and the\r\nboarders--and that boy who used to pull my braids whenever he met me--My\r\nthat would be fine!”\r\n\r\n“I reckon that is what Life does do for us,” returned Hiram,\r\nthoughtfully, stopping at the end of the furrow to mop his brow and let\r\nthe old horse breathe. “Yes, sir! Life plows all the experience under,\r\nand it ought to enrich our future existence, just as this stuff I'm\r\nplowing under here will decay and enrich the soil.”\r\n\r\n“But the plow don't turn it quite under in spots,” said Sister, with\r\na sigh. “Leastways, I can't help remembering the bad things once in a\r\nwhile.”\r\n\r\nThere were certain other individuals who found out very soon that Hiram\r\nwas plowing, too. Those were the hens. There were not more than fifteen\r\nor twenty of the scrubby creatures, and they began to follow the plow\r\nand pick up grubs and worms.\r\n\r\n“I tell you one thing that I've got to do before we put in much,” Hiram\r\ntold the ex-boarding house mistress at noon.\r\n\r\n“What's that, Hi? Don't go very deep down into my pocket, for it won't\r\nstand it. After paying my bills, and paying for moving out here, I ain't\r\ngot much money left--and that's a fact!”\r\n\r\n“It won't cost much, but we've got to have a yard for the hens. Hens and\r\na garden will never mix successfully. Unless you enclose them you might\r\nas well have no garden in that spot where I'm plowing.”\r\n\r\n“There warn't but five eggs to-day,” said Mrs. Atterson. “Mebbe we'd\r\nbetter chop the heads off 'em, one after the other, and eat 'em.”\r\n\r\n“They'll lay better as it grows warmer. That henhouse must be fixed\r\nbefore next winter. It's too draughty,” said Hi. “And then, hens can't\r\nlay well--especially through the winter--if they haven't the proper kind\r\nof food.”\r\n\r\n“But three or four of the dratted things want to stay on the nest all\r\nthe time,” complained the old lady.\r\n\r\n“If I was you, Mrs. Atterson,” Hiram said, soberly, “I'd spend five\r\ndollars for a hundred eggs of well-bred stock.\r\n\r\n“I'd set these hens as fast as they get broody, and raise a decent flock\r\nof biddies for next year. Scrub hens are just as bad as scrub cows. The\r\nscrubs will eat quite as much as full-bloods, yet the returns from the\r\nscrubs are much less.”\r\n\r\n“I declare!” exclaimed Mrs. Atterson, “a hen's always been just a hen\r\nto me--one's the same as another, exceptin' the feathers on some is\r\nprettier.”\r\n\r\n“To-night I'll show you some breeders' catalogs and you can think the\r\nmatter over as to what kind of a fowl you want,” said the young farmer.\r\n\r\nHe went back to his job after dinner and kept steadily at work until\r\nthree o'clock before there came a break. Then he saw a carriage drive\r\ninto the yard, and a few moments later a man In a long gray coat came\r\nstriding across the lot toward him.\r\n\r\nHiram knew the gentleman at once--it was Mr. Bronson, the father of\r\nthe girl he had saved from the runaway. To tell the truth, the boy\r\nhad rather wondered about his non-appearance during the days that\r\nhad elapsed. But now he came with hand held out, and his first words\r\nexplained the seeming omission:\r\n\r\n“I've been away for more than a week, my boy, or I should have seen you\r\nbefore. You're Hiram Strong, aren't you--the boy my little girl has been\r\ntalking so much about?”\r\n\r\n“I don't know how much Miss Lettie has been talking about me,” laughed\r\nHiram. “Full and plenty, I expect.”\r\n\r\n“And small blame to her,” declared Mr. Bronson. “I won't waste time\r\ntelling you how grateful I am. I had just time to turn that boy of\r\nDickerson's off before I was called away. Now, my lad, I want you to\r\ncome and work for me.”\r\n\r\n“Why, much as I might like to, sir, I couldn't do that,” said Hiram.\r\n\r\n“Now, now! we'll fix it somehow. Lettie has set her heart on having you\r\naround the place.\r\n\r\n“You're the second young man I've been after whom I was sure would suit\r\nme, since we moved on to the old Fleigler place. The first fellow I\r\ncan't find; but don't tell me that I am going to be disappointed in you,\r\ntoo.”\r\n\r\n“Mr. Bronson,” said Hiram, gravely, “I'm sorry to say 'No.' A little\r\nwhile ago I'd have been delighted to take up with any fair offer you\r\nmight have made me. But I have agreed with Mrs. Atterson to run her\r\nplace for two seasons.”\r\n\r\n“Two years!” exclaimed Mr. Bronson.\r\n\r\n“Yes, sir. Practically. I must put her on her feet and make the old farm\r\nshow a profit.”\r\n\r\n“You're pretty young to take such responsibility upon your shoulders,\r\nare you not?” queried the gentleman, eyeing him curiously.\r\n\r\n“I'm seventeen. I began to work with my father as soon as I could lift\r\na hoe. I love farm work. And I've passed my word to stick to Mrs.\r\nAtterson.”\r\n\r\n“That's the old lady up to the house?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, sir.”\r\n\r\n“But she wouldn't hold you to your bargain if she saw you could better\r\nyourself, would she?”\r\n\r\n“She would not have to,” Hiram said, firmly, and he began to feel a\r\nlittle disappointed in his caller. “A bargain's a bargain--there's no\r\nbacking out of it.”\r\n\r\n“But suppose I should make it worth her while to give you up?” pursued\r\nMr. Bronson. “I'll sound her a bit, eh? I tell you that Lettie has set\r\nher heart on having you, as we cannot find another chap whom we were\r\nlooking for.”\r\n\r\nNow, Hiram knew that this referred to him; but he said nothing. Besides,\r\nhe did not feel too greatly pleased that the strongest reason for Mr.\r\nBronson's wishing to hire him was his little daughter's demand. It was\r\njust a fancy of Miss Lettie's. And another day, she might have the fancy\r\nto turn him off.\r\n\r\n“No, sir,” spoke Hiram, more firmly. “It is useless. I am obliged to\r\nyou; but I must stick by Mrs. Atterson.”\r\n\r\n“Well, my lad,” said the Westerner, putting out his hand again. “I am\r\nglad to see you know how to keep a promise, even if it isn't to your\r\nadvantage. And I am grateful to you for turning that trick for my little\r\ngirl the other day.”\r\n\r\n“I hope you'll come over and see us--and I shall watch your work here.\r\nMost of these fellows around here are pretty slovenly farmers in my\r\nestimation; I hope you will do better than the average.”\r\n\r\nHe went back across the field and Hiram returned to his plowing. The\r\nyoung farmer saw the bay horses driven slowly out of the yard and along\r\nthe road.\r\n\r\nHe saw the flutter of a scarf from the carriage and knew that Lettie\r\nBronson was with her father; but she did not look out at him as he\r\ntoiled behind the old horse in the furrow.\r\n\r\nHowever, there was no feeling of disappointment in Hiram Strong's\r\nmind--and this fact somewhat surprised him. He had been so attracted by\r\nthe girl, and had wished in the beginning so much to be engaged by Mr.\r\nBronson, that he had considered it a mighty disappointment when he had\r\nlost the Westerner's card.\r\n\r\nHowever, his apathy in the matter was easily explained. He had taken\r\nhold of the work on the Atterson place. His plans were growing in his\r\nmind for the campaign before him. His interest was fastened upon the\r\ncontract he had made with the old lady.\r\n\r\nHis hand was, literally now, “to the plow”--and he was not looking back.\r\n\r\nHe finished the piece that day, and likewise drew out some lime that he\r\nhad bought at Scoville and spread it broadcast upon all the garden patch\r\nsave that in which he intended to put potatoes.\r\n\r\nAlthough it is an exploded doctrine that the application of lime to\r\npotato ground causes scab, it is a fact that it will aid in spreading\r\nthe disease. Hiram was sure enough--because of the sheep-sorrel on the\r\npiece--that it all needed sweetening, but he decided against the lime at\r\nthis time.\r\n\r\nAs soon as Hiram had drag-harrowed the piece he laid off two rows down\r\nthe far end, as being less tempting to the straying hens, and planted\r\nearly peas--the round-seeded variety, hardier than the wrinkled kinds.\r\nThese pea-rows were thirty inches apart, and he dropped the peas by hand\r\nand planted them very thickly.\r\n\r\nIt doesn't pay to be niggardly with seed in putting in early peas, at\r\nany rate--the thicker they come up the better, and in these low bush\r\nvarieties the thickly growing vines help support each other.\r\n\r\nThis garden piece--almost two acres--was oblong in shape. An acre is\r\njust about seventy paces square. Hiram's garden was seventy by a hundred\r\nand forty paces, or thereabout.\r\n\r\nTherefore, the young farmer had two seventy-yard rows of peas, or over\r\nfour hundred feet of drill. He planted two quarts of peas at a cost of\r\nseventy cents.\r\n\r\nWith ordinary fortune the crop should be much more than sufficient for\r\nthe needs of the house while the peas were in a green state, for being a\r\nquick growing vegetable, they are soon past.\r\n\r\nHiram, however, proposed putting in a surplus of almost everything he\r\nplanted in this big garden--especially of the early vegetables--for he\r\nbelieved that there would be a market for them in Scoville.\r\n\r\nThe ground was very cold yet, and snow flurries swept over the field\r\nevery few days; but the peas were under cover and were off his mind;\r\nHiram knew they would be ready to pop up above the surface just as soon\r\nas the warm weather came in earnest, and peas do not easily rot in the\r\nground.\r\n\r\nIn two weeks, or when the weather was settled, he proposed planting\r\nother kinds of peas alongside these first two rows, so as to have a\r\nsuccession up to mid-summer.\r\n\r\nNext the young farmer laid off his furrows for early potatoes. He had\r\nbought a sack of an extra-early variety, yet a potato that, if left\r\nin the ground the full length of the season, would make a good winter\r\nvariety--a “long keeper.”\r\n\r\nHis potato rows he planned to have three feet apart, and he plowed the\r\nfurrows twice, so as to have them clean and deep.\r\n\r\nHenry Pollock happened to come by while he was doing this, and stopped\r\nto talk and watch Hiram. To tell the truth, Henry and his folks were\r\nmore than a little interested in what the young farmer would do with the\r\nAtterson place.\r\n\r\nLike other neighbors they doubted if the stranger knew as much about the\r\npractical work of farming as he claimed to know. “That feller from\r\nthe city,” the neighbors called Hiram behind his back, and that is an\r\nexpression that completely condemns a man in the mind of the average\r\ncountryman.\r\n\r\n“What yer bein' so particular with them furrers for, Hiram?” asked\r\nHenry.\r\n\r\n“If a job's worth doing at all, it's worth doing well, isn't it?”\r\n laughed the young farmer.\r\n\r\n“We spread our manure broadcast--when we use any at all--for potatoes,”\r\n said Henry, slowly. “Dad says if manure comes in contact with potatoes,\r\nthey are apt to rot.”\r\n\r\n“That seems to be a general opinion,” replied Hiram. “And it may be so\r\nunder certain conditions. For that reason I am going to make sure that\r\nnot much of this fertilizer comes in direct contact with my seed.”\r\n\r\n“How'll you do that?” “I'll show you,” said Hiram.\r\n\r\nHaving run out his rows and covered the bottom of each furrow several\r\ninches deep with the manure, he ran his plow down one side of each\r\nfurrow and turned the soil back upon the fertilizer, covering it and\r\nleaving a well pulverized seed bed for the potatoes to lie in.\r\n\r\n“Well,” said Henry, “that's a good wrinkle, too.”\r\n\r\nHiram had purchased some formalin, mixed it with water according to the\r\nGovernment expert's instructions, and from time to time soaked his seed\r\npotatoes two hours in the antiseptic bath. In the evening he brought\r\nthem into the kitchen and they all--even Old Lem Camp--cut up the\r\npotatoes, leaving two or three good eyes in each piece.\r\n\r\n“I'd ruther do this than peel 'em for the boarders,” remarked Sister,\r\nlooking at her deeply-stained fingers reflectively. “And then, nobody\r\nwon't say nothin' about my hands to me when I'm passin' dishes at the\r\ntable.”\r\n\r\nThe following day she helped Hiram drop the seed, and by night he had\r\ncovered them by running his plow down the other side of the row and\r\nthen smoothed the potato plat with a home-made “board” in lieu of a\r\nland-roller.\r\n\r\nIt was the twentieth of March, and not a farmer in the locality had yet\r\nput in either potatoes, or peas. Some had not as yet plowed for early\r\npotatoes, and Henry Pollock warned Hiram that he was “rushing the\r\nseason.”\r\n\r\n“That may be,” declared the young farmer to Mrs. Atterson. “But I\r\nbelieve the risk is worth taking. If we do get 'em good, we'll get 'em\r\nearly and skim the cream of the local market. Now, you see!”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV. TROUBLE BREWS\r\n\r\n“Old Lem Camp,” as he had been called for so many years that there\r\nseemed no disrespect in the title, was waking up. Not many mornings was\r\nhe a lie-abed. And the lines in his forehead seemed to be smoothing out,\r\nand his eyes had lost something of their dullness.\r\n\r\nIt was true that, at first, he wandered about the farmstead muttering\r\nto himself in his old way--an endless monologue which was a jumble of\r\ncomment, gratitude, and the brief memories of other days. It took some\r\ntime to adjust his poor mind to the fact that he had no longer to\r\nfear that Poverty which had stalked ever before him like a threatening\r\nspirit.\r\n\r\nGratitude spurred him to the use of his hands. He was not a broken\r\nman--not bodily. Many light tasks soon fell to his share, and Mrs.\r\nAtterson told Hiram and Sister to let him do what he would. To busy\r\nhimself would be the best thing in the world for the old fellow.\r\n\r\n“That's what's been the matter with Mr. Camp for years,” she declared,\r\nwith conviction. “Because he passed the sixty-year mark, and it was\r\nagainst the practise of the paper company to keep employees on the\r\npayroll over that age, they turned Lem Camp off.\r\n\r\n“Ridiculous! He was just as well able to do the tasks that he had\r\nlearned to do mechanically as he had been any time for the previous\r\ntwenty years. He had worked in that office forty years, and more, you\r\nunderstand.\r\n\r\n“That's the worst thing about a corporation of that kind--it has no\r\nthought beyond its 'rules.' Old Mr. Bundy remembered Lem--that's all.\r\nIf he hadn't so much stock in the concern they'd turn him off, too. I\r\nexpect he knows it and that's what softened his heart to Old Lem.\r\n\r\n“Now, let Lem take hold of whatever he can do, and git interested in\r\nit,” declared the practical Mrs. Atterson, “and he'll show you that\r\nthere's work left in him yet. Yes-sir-ree-sir! And if he'll work in the\r\nopen air, all the better for him.”\r\n\r\nThere was plenty for everybody to do, and Hiram would not say the old\r\nman nay. The seed boxes needed a good deal of attention, for they were\r\nto be lifted out into the air on warm days, and placed in the sun. And\r\nOld Lem could do this--and stir the soil in them, and pull out the grass\r\nand other weeds that started.\r\n\r\nHiram had planted early cabbage and cauliflower and egg-plant in other\r\nboxes, and the beets were almost big enough to transplant to the open\r\nground. Beets are hardy and although hair-roots are apt to form on\r\ntransplanted garden beets, the transplanting aids the growth in other\r\nways and Hiram expected to have table-beets very early.\r\n\r\nIn the garden itself he had already run out two rows of later beets, the\r\nwidth of the plot. Bunched beets will sell for a fair price the whole\r\nseason through.\r\n\r\nHiram was giving his whole heart and soul to the work--he was wrapped up\r\nin the effort to make the farm pay. And for good reason.\r\n\r\nIt was “up to him” to not alone turn a profit for his employer, and\r\nhimself; but he desired--oh, how strongly!--to show the city folk who\r\nhad sneered at him that he could be a success in the right environment.\r\n\r\nBesides, and in addition, Hiram Strong was ambitious--very ambitious\r\nindeed for a youth of his age. He wanted to own a farm of his own in\r\ntime--and it was no “one-horse farm” he aimed at.\r\n\r\nNo, indeed! Hiram had read of the scientific farming of the Middle West,\r\nand the enormous tracts in the Northwest devoted to grain and other\r\nstaple crops, where the work was done for the most part by machinery.\r\n\r\nHe longed to see all this--and to take part in it. He desired the big\r\nthings in farming, nor would he ever be content to remain a helper.\r\n\r\n“I'm going to be my own boss, some day--and I'm going to boss other men.\r\nI'll show these fellows around here that I know what I want, and when I\r\nget it I'll handle it right!” Hiram soliloquized.\r\n\r\n“It's up to me to save every cent I can. Henry thinks I'm niggardly,\r\nI expect, because I wouldn't go to town Saturday night with him. But I\r\nhaven't any money to waste.\r\n\r\n“The hundred I'm to get next Christmas from Mrs. Atterson I don't wish\r\nto draw on at all. I'll get along with such old clothes as I've got.”\r\n\r\nHiram was not naturally a miser; he frequently bought some little thing\r\nfor Sister when he went to town--a hair-ribbon, or the like, which he\r\nknew would please the girl; but for himself he was determined to be\r\nsaving.\r\n\r\nAt the end of his contract with Mrs. Atterson he would have two hundred\r\ndollars anyway. But that was not the end and aim of Hiram Strong's\r\nhopes.\r\n\r\n“It's the clause in our agreement about the profits of our second season\r\nthat is my bright and shining star,” he told the good lady more than\r\nonce. “I don't know yet what we had better put in next year to bring us\r\na fortune; but we'll know before it comes time to plant it.”\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the wheel-hoe and seeder he had insisted upon Mrs. Atterson\r\nbuying had arrived, and Hiram, after studying the instructions which\r\ncame with it, set the machine up as a seed-sower. Later, after the\r\nbulk of the seeds were in the ground, he would take off the seeding\r\nattachment and bolt on the hoe, or cultivator attachments, with which to\r\nstir the soil between the narrower rows of vegetables.\r\n\r\nAs he made ready to plant seeds such as carrot, parsnip, onion, salsify,\r\nand leaf-beet, as well as spring spinach, early turnips, radishes and\r\nkohlrabi, Hiram worked that part of his plowed land over again and again\r\nwith the spike harrow, finally boarding the strips down smoothly as\r\nhe wished to plant them. The seedbed must be as level as a floor, and\r\ncompact, for good use to be made of the wheel-seeder.\r\n\r\nWhen he had lined out one row with his garden line, from side to side of\r\nthe plowed strip, the marking arrangement attached to his seeder would\r\nmark the following lines plainly, and at just the distance he desired.\r\n\r\nOnions, carrots, and the like, he put in fifteen inches apart, intending\r\nto do all the cultivating of those extremely small plants with the\r\nwheel-hoe, after they were large enough. But he foresaw the many hours\r\nof cultivating before him and marked the rows for the bulk of the\r\nvegetables far enough apart, as he had first intended, to make possible\r\nthe use of the horse-hoe.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile he spike-harrowed the potato patch, running cross-wise of the\r\nrows to break the crust and keep down the quick-springing weed seeds.\r\nThe early peas were already above ground and when they were two inches\r\nhigh Hiram ran his 14-tooth cultivator--or “seed harrow” as it is called\r\nin some localities--close to the rows so as to throw the soil toward the\r\nplants, almost burying them from sight again. This was to give the peas\r\ndeep rootage, which is a point necessary for the quick and stable growth\r\nof this vegetable.\r\n\r\nIn odd moments Hiram had cut and set a few posts, bought poultry netting\r\nin Scoville, and enclosed Mrs. Atterson's chicken-run. She had taken his\r\nadvice and sent for eggs, and already had four hens setting and expected\r\nto set the remainder of the of the eggs in a few days.\r\n\r\nSister took an enormous interest in this poultry-raising venture. She\r\n“counted chickens before they were hatched” with a vengeance, and after\r\nreading a few of the poultry catalogs she figured out that, in three\r\nyears, from the increase of Mother Atterson's hundred eggs, the\r\neighty-acre farm would not be large enough to contain the flock.\r\n\r\n“And all from five dollars!” gasped Sister. “I don't see why everybody\r\ndoesn't go to raising chickens--then there'd be no poor folks, everybody\r\nwould be rich--Well! I expect there'd always have to be institutions for\r\norphans--and boarding houses!”\r\n\r\nThe new-springing things from the ground, the “hen industry” and the\r\nrepairing and beautifying of the outside of the farmhouse did not take\r\nup all their attention. There were serious matters to be discussed in\r\nthe evening, after the others had gone to bed, 'twixt Hiram and his\r\nemployer.\r\n\r\nThere was the five or six acres of bottom land--the richest piece of\r\nsoil of the entire eighty. Hiram had not forgotten this, and the second\r\nSunday of their stay at the farm, after the whole family had attended\r\nservice at a chapel less than half a mile up the road, he had urged Mrs.\r\nAtterson to walk with him through the timber to the riverside.\r\n\r\n“For the Land o' Goshen!” the ex-boarding house mistress had finally\r\nexclaimed. “To think that I own all of this. Why, Hi, it don't seem as\r\nif it was so. I can't get used to it. And this timber, you say, is all\r\nworth money? And if I cut it off, it will grow up again----”\r\n\r\n“In thirty to forty years the pine will be worth cutting again--and some\r\nof the other trees,” said Hiram, with a smile.\r\n\r\n“Well! that would be something for Sister to look forward to,” said\r\nthe old lady, evidently thinking aloud. “And I don't expect her\r\nfolks--whoever they be--will ever look her up now, Hiram.”\r\n\r\n“But with the timber cut and this side hill cleared, you would have a\r\nvery valuable thirty acres, or so, of tillage--valuable for almost any\r\ncrop, and early, too, for it slopes toward the sun,” said the young\r\nfarmer, ignoring the other's observation.\r\n\r\n“Well, well! it's wonderful,” returned Mrs. Atterson.\r\n\r\nBut she listened attentively to what he had to say about clearing the\r\nbottom land, which was a much more easily accomplished task, as Hiram\r\nshowed her. It would cost something to put the land into shape for\r\nlate corn, and so prepare it for some more valuable crop the following\r\nseason.\r\n\r\n“Well, nothing ventured, nothing have!” Mrs. Atterson finally agreed.\r\n“Go ahead--if it won't cost much more than what you say to get the corn\r\nin. I understand it's a gamble, and I'm taking a gambler's chance.\r\nIf the river rises and floods the corn in June, or July, then we get\r\nnothing this season?”\r\n\r\n“That is a possibility,” admitted Hiram.\r\n\r\n“Go ahead,” exclaimed Mother Atterson. “I never did know that there was\r\nsporting blood in me; but I kinder feel it risin', Hi, with the sap in\r\nthe trees. We'll chance it!”\r\n\r\nOccasionally Hiram had stepped down to the pasture and squinted across\r\nto the water-hole. The grass was not long enough yet to turn the cow\r\ninto the field, so he was obliged to make these special trips to the\r\npasture.\r\n\r\nHe had seen nothing of the Dickersons--to speak to, that is--since his\r\ntrouble with Pete. And, of a sudden, just before dinner one noon, Hiram\r\ntook a look at the pasture and beheld a figure seemingly working down in\r\nthe corner.\r\n\r\nHiram ran swiftly in that direction. Half-way there he saw that it was\r\nPete, and that he had deliberately cut out a panel of the fence and was\r\nletting a pair of horses he had been plowing with, drink at the pool,\r\nbefore he took them home to the Dickerson stable.\r\n\r\nHiram stopped running and recovered his breath before he reached the\r\nlower corner of the pasture. Pete saw him coming, and grinned impudently\r\nat him.\r\n\r\n“What are you doing here, Dickerson?” demanded the young farmer,\r\nindignantly.\r\n\r\n“Well, if you wanter keep us out, you'd better keep up your fences\r\nbetter,” returned Pete. “I seen the wires down, and it's handy----”\r\n\r\n“You cut those wires!” interrupted Hiram, angrily.\r\n\r\n“You're another,” drawled Pete, but grinning in a way to exasperate the\r\nyoung farmer.\r\n\r\n“I know you did so.”\r\n\r\n“Wal, if you know so much, what are you going to do about it?” demanded\r\nthe other. “I guess you'll find that these wires will snap 'bout as fast\r\nas you can mend 'em. Now, you can put that in your pipe an' smoke it!”\r\n\r\n“But I don't smoke.” Hiram observed, growing calm immediately. There was\r\nno use in giving this lout the advantage of showing anger with him.\r\n\r\n“Mr. Smartie!” snarled Pete Dickerson. “Now, you see, there's somebody\r\njust as smart as you be. These horses have drunk there, and they're\r\ngoing to drink again.”\r\n\r\n“Is that your father yonder?” demanded Hiram, shortly.\r\n\r\n“Yes, it is.”\r\n\r\n“Call him over here.”\r\n\r\n“Why, if he comes over here, he'll eat you alive!” cried Pete,\r\nlaughing. “You don't know my dad.”\r\n\r\n“I don't; but I want to,” Hiram said, calmly. “That's why you'd better\r\ncall him over. I have got pretty well acquainted with you, and the rest\r\nof your family can't be any worse, as I look at it. Call him over,” and\r\nthe young farmer stepped nearer to the lout.\r\n\r\n“You call him yourself!” cried Pete, beginning to back away, for he\r\nremembered how he had been treated at his previous encounter with Hiram.\r\n\r\nHiram seized the bridles of the work horses, and shook them out of\r\nPete's clutch.\r\n\r\n“Tell your father to come here,” commanded the young farmer, fire in his\r\neyes. “We'll settle this thing here and now.\r\n\r\n“These horses are on Mrs. Atterson's land. I know the county stock\r\nlaw as well as you do. You cut this fence, and your cattle are on her\r\nground.\r\n\r\n“It will cost you a dollar a head to get them off again--if Mrs.\r\nAtterson wishes to demand it. Now, call your father.”\r\n\r\nPete raised a yell which startled the long-legged man striding over the\r\nhill toward the Dickerson farmhouse. Hiram saw the older Dickerson turn,\r\nstare, and then start toward them.\r\n\r\nPete continued to beckon, and began to yell:\r\n\r\n“Dad! Dad! He won't let me have the hosses!”\r\n\r\nSam Dickerson came striding down to the waterhole--a lean, long,\r\nsour-looking man he was, with a brown face knotted into a continual\r\nscowl, and hard, bony hands. Yet Hiram was not afraid of him.\r\n\r\n“What's the trouble here?” growled the farmer.\r\n\r\n“He's got the hosses. I told you the fence was down and I was goin' to\r\nwater 'em----”\r\n\r\n“Shut up!” commanded his father, eyeing Hiram. “I'm talking to this\r\nfellow: What's the trouble here?”\r\n\r\n“Your horses are on Mrs. Atterson's land,” Hiram said, quietly. “You\r\nknow that stock which strays can be held for a dollar a head--damage or\r\nno damage to crops. I warn you, keep your horses on your own land.”\r\n\r\n“That's your fence; if you don't keep it up, who's fault is it if my\r\nhorses get on your land?” growled Dickerson, evidently making the matter\r\na personal one with Hiram.\r\n\r\n“Your boy here cut the wires.”\r\n\r\n“No I didn't, Dad!” interposed Pete.\r\n\r\nQuick as a flash Hiram dropped the bridle reins, sprang for Pete, seized\r\nhim in a wrestler's grip, twisted him around, and tore from his pocket a\r\npair of heavy wire-cutters.\r\n\r\n“What were you doing with these in your pocket, then?” demanded Hiram,\r\ndisdainfully, tossing the plyers upon the ground at Pete's feet, and\r\nstepping back to keep the restless horses from leaving the edge of the\r\nwater-hole.\r\n\r\nSam Dickerson seemed to take a grim pleasure in his son's overthrow. He\r\ngrowled:\r\n\r\n“He's got you there, Pete. You'd better stop monkeyin' around here. Pick\r\nup them bridles and come on.”\r\n\r\nHe turned to depart without another word to Hiram; but the latter did\r\nnot propose to be put off that way.\r\n\r\n“Hold on!” he called. “Who's going to mend this fence, Mr. Dickerson?”\r\n\r\nDickerson turned and eyed him coldly again.\r\n\r\n“What's that to me? Mend your own fence,” he said.\r\n\r\n“Then I shall take these horses up to our barn. You can come and settle\r\nthe matter with Mrs. Atterson--unless you wish to pay me two dollars\r\nhere and now,” said the young farmer, his voice carrying clearly to\r\nwhere the man stood upon the rising ground above him.\r\n\r\n“Why, you young whelp!” roared Dickerson, suddenly starting down the\r\nslope.\r\n\r\nBut Hiram Strong neither moved nor showed fear. Somehow, this sturdy\r\nyoung fellow, in the high laced boots, with his flannel shirt open at\r\nthe throat, raw as was the day, his sleeves rolled back to his elbows,\r\nwas a figure to make even a more muscular man than Sam Dickerson\r\nhesitate.\r\n\r\n“Pete!” exclaimed the farmer, harshly, still eyeing Hiram. “Run up to\r\nthe house and bring my shotgun. Be quick about it.”\r\n\r\nHiram said never a word, and the horses, yoked together, began to crop\r\nthe short grass springing upon the bank of the water-hole.\r\n\r\n“You'll find out you're fooling with the wrong man, you whippersnapper!”\r\n promised Dickerson.\r\n\r\n“You can pay me two dollars and I'll mend the fence; or you can mend the\r\nfence and we'll call it square,” said Hiram, slowly, and evenly. “I'm a\r\nboy, but I'm not to be frightened with a threat----”\r\n\r\nPete's long legs brought him flying back across the fields. Nothing he\r\nhad done in a long while pleased him quite as much as this errand.\r\n\r\nHiram turned, jerked at the horses' bridle-reins, turned them around,\r\nand with a sharp slap on the nigh one's flank, sent them both trotting\r\nup into the Atterson pasture.\r\n\r\n“Stop that, you rascal!” cried Dickerson, grabbing the gun from his\r\nhopeful son, and losing his head now entirely. “Bring that team back!”\r\n\r\n“You mend the fence, and I will,” declared Hiram, unshaken.\r\n\r\nThe angry man sprang down to his level, flourishing the gun in a way\r\nthat would have been dangerous indeed had Hiram believed it to be\r\nloaded. And as it was, the young farmer was very angry.\r\n\r\nThe right was on his side; if he allowed these Dickersons, father and\r\nson, to browbeat him this once, it would only lead to future trouble.\r\n\r\nThis thing had to be settled right here and now. It would never do for\r\nHiram to show fear. And if both of the long-legged Dickersons pitched\r\nupon him, of course, he would be no match for them.\r\n\r\nBut Sam Dickerson stumbled and almost fell as he reached the edge of the\r\nwater-hole, and before he could recover himself, Hiram leaped upon him,\r\nseized the shotgun, and wrenched it from his hands.\r\n\r\nHe reversed the weapon in a flash, clubbed it, and raised it over his\r\nhead with a threatening swing that made Pete yell from the top of the\r\nbank:\r\n\r\n“Look out, Dad! He's a-goin' ter swat yer!”\r\n\r\nSam tried to scramble out of the way. But down came the gun butt with\r\nall the force of Hiram's good muscle, and--the stock was splintered and\r\nthe lock shattered upon the big stone that here cropped out of the bank.\r\n\r\n“There's your gun--what's left of it,” panted the young farmer, tossing\r\nthe broken weapon from him. “Now, don't you ever threaten me with a gun\r\nagain, for if you do I'll have you arrested.\r\n\r\n“We've got to be neighbors, and we've got to get along in a neighborly\r\nmanner. But I'm not going to allow you to take advantage of Mrs.\r\nAtterson, because she is a woman.\r\n\r\n“Now, Mr. Dickerson,” he added, as the man scrambled up, glaring at him\r\nevidently with more surprise than anger, “if you'll make Pete mend this\r\nfence, you can have your horses. Otherwise I'm going to 'pound' them\r\naccording to the stock law of the county.”\r\n\r\n“Pete,” said his father, briefly, “go get your hammer and staples and\r\nmend this fence up as good as you found it.”\r\n\r\n“And now,” said Hiram, “I'm going home to gear the horse to the wagon,\r\nand I'll drive over to your house, Mr. Dickerson. From time to time you\r\nhave borrowed while Uncle Jeptha was alive quite a number of tools. I\r\nwant them. I have made inquiries and I know what tools they are. Just be\r\nprepared to put them into my wagon, will you?”\r\n\r\nHe turned on his heel without further words and left the Dickersons\r\nto catch their horses, and to repair the fence--both of which they did\r\npromptly.\r\n\r\nNot only that, but when Hiram drove into the Dickerson dooryard an hour\r\nlater he had no trouble about recovering the tools which the neighbor\r\nhad borrowed and failed to return.\r\n\r\nPete scowled at him and muttered uncomplimentary remarks; but Sam\r\nphlegmatically smoked his pipe and sat watching the young farmer without\r\nany comment.\r\n\r\n“And so, that much is accomplished,” ruminated Hiram, as he drove home.\r\n“But I'm not sure whether hostilities are finished, or have just begun.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV. ONE SATURDAY AFTERNOON\r\n\r\n“The old Atterson place” as it was called in the neighborhood, began to\r\ntake on a brisk appearance these days. Sister, with the help of Old Lem\r\nCamp, had long since raked the dooryard clean and burned the rubbish\r\nwhich is bound to gather during the winter.\r\n\r\nYears before there had been flower beds in front; but Uncle Jeptha had\r\nallowed the grass to overrun them. It was a month too early to think of\r\nplanting many flowers; but Hiram had bought some seeds, and he showed\r\nSister how to prepare boxes for them in the sunny kitchen windows, along\r\nwith the other plant boxes; and around the front porch he spaded up a\r\nstrip, enriched it well, and almost the first seeds put into the ground\r\non the farm were the sweet peas around this porch. Mother Atterson was\r\nvery fond of these flowers and had always managed to coax some of them\r\nto grow even in the boarding-house back yard.\r\n\r\nAt the side porch she proposed to have morning-glories and moon-flowers,\r\nwhile the beds in front would be filled with those old-fashioned flowers\r\nwhich everybody loves.\r\n\r\n“But if we can't make our own flower-beds, we can go without them, Hi,”\r\n said the bustling old lady. “We mustn't take you from your other work\r\nto spade beds for us. Every cat's got to catch mice on this place, now I\r\ntell ye!”\r\n\r\nAnd Hiram certainly was busy enough these days. The early seeds were all\r\nin, however, and he had run the seed-harrow over the potato rows again,\r\nlengthwise, to keep the weeds out until the young plants should get a\r\nstart.\r\n\r\nDespite the raw winds and frosts at night, the potatoes had come up well\r\nand, with the steadily warming wind and sun, would now begin to grow.\r\nOther farmers' potatoes in the vicinity were not yet breaking the\r\nground.\r\n\r\nEarly on Monday morning Henry Pollock appeared with bush-axe and\r\ngrubbing hoe, and Hiram shouldered similar tools and they started for\r\nthe river bottom. It was so far from the house that Mrs. Atterson agreed\r\nto send their dinner to them.\r\n\r\n“Father says he remembers seeing corn growing on this bottom,” said\r\nHenry, as they set to work, “so high that the ears were as high up as a\r\ntall man. It's splendid corn land--if it don't get flooded out.”\r\n\r\n“And does the river often over-ran its banks?” queried Hiram, anxiously.\r\n\r\n“Pretty frequent. It hasn't yet this year; there wasn't much snow last\r\nwinter, you see, and the early spring floods weren't very high. But\r\nif we have a long wet spell, as we do have sometimes as late as July,\r\nyou'll see water here.”\r\n\r\n“That's not very encouraging,” said Hiram. “Not for corn prospects, at\r\nleast.”\r\n\r\n“Well, corn's our staple crop. You see, if you raise corn enough you're\r\nsure of feed for your team. That's the main point.”\r\n\r\n“But people with bigger farms than they have around here can raise corn\r\ncheaper than we can. They use machinery in harvesting it, too. Why not\r\nraise a better paying crop, and buy the extra corn you may need?”\r\n\r\n“Why,” responded Henry, shaking his head, “nobody around here knows much\r\nabout raising fancy crops. I read about 'em in the farm papers--oh, yes,\r\nwe take papers--the cheap ones. There is a lot of information in 'em, I\r\nguess; but father don't believe much that's printed.”\r\n\r\n“Doesn't believe much that's printed?” repeated Hiram, curiously.\r\n\r\n“Nope. He says it's all lies, made up out of some man's head. You see,\r\nwe useter take books out of the Sunday School library, and we had story\r\npapers, too; and father used to read 'em as much as anybody.”\r\n\r\n“But one summer we had a summer boarder--a man that wrote things. He\r\nhad one of these dinky little merchines with him that you play on like a\r\npiano, you know----”\r\n\r\n“A typewriter?” suggested Hiram, with a smile.\r\n\r\n“Yep. Well, he wrote stories. Father learnt as how all that stuff was\r\njust imaginary, and so he don't take no stock in printed stuff any more.”\r\n\r\n“That man just sat down at that merchine, and rattled off a story that\r\nhe got real money for. It didn't have to be true at all.\r\n\r\n“So father soured on it. And he says the stuff in the farm papers is\r\njust the same.”\r\n\r\n“I'm afraid that your father is mistaken there,” said Hiram, hiding\r\nhis amusement. “Men who have spent years in studying agricultural\r\nconditions, and experimenting with soils, and seeds, and plants, and\r\nfertilizers, and all that, write what facts they have learned for our\r\nbetterment.\r\n\r\n“No trade in the world is so encouraged and aided by Governments, and by\r\nprivate corporations, as the trade of farming. There is scarcely a State\r\nwhich does not have a special agricultural college in which there are\r\nwinter courses for people who cannot give the open time of the year to\r\npractical experiment on the college grounds.\r\n\r\n“That is what you need in this locality, I guess,” added Hiram. “Some\r\nscientific farming.”\r\n\r\n“Book farming, father calls it,” said Henry. “And he says it's no good.”\r\n\r\n“Why don't you save your money and take a course next winter in some\r\nside line and so be able to show him that he's wrong?” suggested Hiram.\r\n“I want to do that myself after I have fulfilled my contract with Mrs.\r\nAtterson.\r\n\r\n“I won't be able to do so next winter, for I shall be on wages. You're\r\ngoing to be a farmer, aren't you?”\r\n\r\n“I expect to. We've got a good farm as farms go around here. But it\r\nseems about all we can do to pay our fertilizer bills and get a living\r\noff it.”\r\n\r\n“Then why don't you go about fitting yourself for your job?” “asked\r\nHiram. Be a good farmer--an up-to-date farmer.\r\n\r\n“No fellow expects to be a machinist, or an electrician, or the like,\r\nwithout spending some time under good instructors. Most that I know\r\nabout soils, and fertilizers, and plant development, and the like, I\r\nlearned from my father, who kept abreast of the times by reading and\r\nexperiment.\r\n\r\n“You can stumble along, working at your trade of farming, and only half\r\nknowing it all your life; that's what most farmers do, in fact. They are\r\ntoo lazy to take up the scientific side of it and learn why.\r\n\r\n“That's the point--learn why you do things that your father did, and his\r\nfather did, and his father before him. There's usually good reason why\r\nthey did it--a scientific reason which somebody dug out by experiment\r\nages ago; but you ought to be able to tell why.”\r\n\r\n“I suppose that's so,” admitted Henry, as they worked on, side by side.\r\n“But I don't know what father would say if I sprung a college course on\r\nhim!”\r\n\r\n“I'd find out,” returned Hiram, laughing. “You'd better spend your money\r\nthat way than for a horse and buggy. That's the highest ambition of most\r\nboys in the country.”\r\n\r\nThe labor of bushing and grubbing these acres of lowland was no light\r\none. Hiram insisted that every stub and root be removed that a heavy\r\nplow could not tear out. They had made some progress by noon, however,\r\nwhen Sister came down with their dinner.\r\n\r\nHiram built a campfire over which the coffee was re-heated, and the\r\nthree ate together, Sister enjoying the picnic to the full. She insisted\r\non helping in the work by piling the brush and roots into heaps for\r\nburning, and she remained until midafternoon.\r\n\r\n“I like that Henry boy,” she confided to Hiram. “He don't pull my braids,\r\nor poke fun at me.”\r\n\r\nBut Sister was developing and growing fast these days. She was putting\r\non flesh and color showed in her cheeks. They were no longer hollow and\r\nsallow, and she ran like a colt-and was almost as wild.\r\n\r\nThe work of clearing the bottom land could not be continued daily; but\r\nthe boys got in three full days that week, and Saturday morning. Henry,\r\ndid not wish to work on Saturday afternoon, for in this locality almost\r\nall the farmers knocked off work at noon Saturday and went to town.\r\n\r\nBut when Henry shouldered his tools to go home at noon, Sister appeared\r\nas usual with the lunch, and she and Hiram cut fishing rods and planned\r\nto have a real picnic.\r\n\r\nTrout and mullet were jumping in the pools under the bank; and they\r\ncaught several before stopping to eat their own meal. The freshly caught\r\nfish were a fine addition to the repast.\r\n\r\nThey went back to fishing after a while and caught enough for supper at\r\nthe farmhouse. Just as they were reeling up their lines the silence of\r\nthe place was disturbed by a strange sound.\r\n\r\n“There's a motorcycle coming!” cried Sister, jumping up and looking all\r\naround.\r\n\r\nThere was a bend in the river below this bottom, and another above; so\r\nthey could not see far in either direction unless they climbed to the\r\nhigh ground. For a minute Hiram could not tell in which direction the\r\nsound was coming; but he knew the steady put-put-put must be the exhaust\r\nof a motor-boat.\r\n\r\nIt soon poked its nose around the lower turn. It was a good-sized boat\r\nand instantly Hiram recognized at least one person aboard.\r\n\r\nMiss Lettie Bronson, in a very pretty boating costume, was in the bow.\r\nThere were half a dozen other girls with her--well dressed girls, who\r\nwere evidently her friends from the St. Beris school at Scoville.\r\n\r\n“Oh, oh! what a pretty spot!” cried Lettie, on the instant. “We'll go\r\nashore here and have our luncheon, girls.”\r\n\r\nShe did not see Hiram and Sister for a moment; but the latter tugged at\r\nHiram's sleeve.\r\n\r\n“I've seen that girl before,” she whispered. “She came in the carriage\r\nwith the man who spoke to you--you remember? She asked me if I had\r\nalways lived in the country, and how I tore my frock.”\r\n\r\n“Isn't she pretty?” returned Hiram.\r\n\r\n“Awfully. But I'm not sure that I like her yet.”\r\n\r\nSuddenly Lettie saw Hiram and the girl beside him. She started, flushed\r\na little, and then gave Hiram a cool little nod and turned her gaze from\r\nhim. Her manner showed that he was not “down in her good books,” and the\r\nyoung fellow flushed in turn.\r\n\r\n“I don't know as we'd better try to make the bank here, Miss,” said the\r\nman who was directing the motor-boat. “The current's mighty sharp.”\r\n\r\n“I want to land here,” said Lettie, decidedly. “It's the prettiest spot\r\nwe've seen--isn't it, girls?”\r\n\r\nHer friends agreed. Hiram, casting a quick eye over the ruffled surface\r\nof the river, saw that the man was right. How well the stream below was\r\nfitted for motor-boating he did not know; but he was pretty sure that\r\nthere were too many ledges just under the surface here to make it safe\r\nfor the boat to go farther.\r\n\r\n“I intend to land here-right by that big tree!” commanded Lettie\r\nBronson, stamping her foot.\r\n\r\n“Well, I dunno,” drawled the man; and just then the bow of the boat\r\nswung around, was forced heavily down stream by the current, and slam it\r\nwent against a reef!\r\n\r\nThe man shot off the engine instantly. The bow of the boat was lodged\r\non the rock, and tip-tilted considerably. The girls screamed, and Lettie\r\nherself was almost thrown into the water, for she was standing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII. MR. PEPPER APPEARS\r\n\r\nBut Hiram noted again that Lettie Bronson did not display terror. While\r\nher friends were screaming and crying, she sat perfectly quiet, and for\r\na minute said never a word.\r\n\r\n“Can't you back off?” Hi heard her ask the boatman.\r\n\r\n“Not without lightening her, Miss. And she may have smashed a plank up\r\nthere, too. I dunno.”\r\n\r\nThe Western girl turned immediately to Hiram, who had now come to the\r\nbank's edge. She smiled at him charmingly, and her eyes danced. She\r\nevidently appreciated the fact that the young farmer had her at a\r\ndisadvantage--and she had meant to snub him.\r\n\r\n“I guess you'll have to help me again, Mr. Strong,” she said. “What will\r\nwe do? Can you push out a plank to us, or something?”\r\n\r\n“I'm afraid not, Miss Bronson,” he returned. “I could cut a pole and\r\nreach it to the boat; but you girls couldn't walk ashore on it.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, dear! have we got to wade?” cried one of Lettie's friends.\r\n\r\n“You can't wade. It's too deep between the shore and the boat,” Hiram\r\nsaid, calmly.\r\n\r\n“Then--then we'll stay here till the tide rises and dr-dr-drowns us!”\r\n wailed another of the girls, giving way to sobs.\r\n\r\n“Don't be a goose, Myra Carroll!” exclaimed Lettie. “If you waited here\r\nfor the tide to rise you'd be gray-haired and decrepit. The tide doesn't\r\nrise here. But maybe a spring flood would wash you away.”\r\n\r\nAt that the frightened one sobbed harder than ever. She was one of\r\nthose who ever see the dark side of adventure. There was no hope on her\r\nhorizon.\r\n\r\n“I dunno what you can do for these girls,” said the man. “I'd git out\r\nand push off the boat, but I don't dare with them aboard.”\r\n\r\nBut Hiram's mind had not been inactive, if he was standing in seeming\r\nidleness. Sister tugged at his sleeve again and whispered:\r\n\r\n“Have they got to stay there and drown, Hi?”\r\n\r\n“I guess not,” he returned, slowly. “Let's see: this old sycamore\r\nleans right out over them. I can shin up there with the aid of the big\r\ngrapevine. Then, if I had a rope----”\r\n\r\n“Shall I run and get one?” demanded Sister, listening to him.\r\n\r\n“Hullo!” exclaimed Hiram, speaking to the man in the boat.\r\n\r\n“Well?” asked the fellow.\r\n\r\n“Haven't you got a coil of strong rope aboard?”\r\n\r\n“There's the painter,” said the man.\r\n\r\n“Toss it ashore here,” commanded Hiram.\r\n\r\n“Oh, Hiram Strong!” cried Lettie. “You don't expect us to walk\r\ntightrope, do you?” and she began to giggle.\r\n\r\n“No. I want you to unfasten the end of the rope. I want it clear--that's\r\nit,” said Hiram. “And it's long enough, I can see.”\r\n\r\n“For what?” asked Sister.\r\n\r\n“Wait and you'll see,” returned the young farmer, hastily coiling the\r\nrope again.\r\n\r\nHe hung it over his shoulder and then started to climb the big sycamore.\r\nHe could go up the bole of this leaning tree very quickly, for the huge\r\ngrapevine gave him a hand-hold all the way.\r\n\r\n“Whatever are you going to do?” cried Lettie Bronson, looking up at him,\r\nas did the other girls.\r\n\r\n“Now,” said Hiram, in the first small crotch of the tree, which was\r\nalmost directly over the stranded launch, “if you girls have any pluck\r\nat all, I can get you ashore, one by one.”\r\n\r\n“What do you mean for us to do, Hiram?” repeated Lettie.\r\n\r\nThe young farmer quickly fashioned a noose at the end of the line--not a\r\nslipnoose, for that would tighten and hurt anybody bearing upon it. This\r\nhe dropped down to the boat and Lettie caught it.\r\n\r\n“Get your head and shoulders through that noose, Miss Bronson,” he\r\ncommanded. “Let it come under your arms. I will lift you out of the boat\r\nand swing you back and forth--there's none of you so heavy that I can't\r\ndo this, and if you wet your feet a little, what's the odds?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, dear! I can never do that!” squealed one of the other girls.\r\n\r\n“Guess you'll have to do it if you don't want to stay here all night,”\r\n returned Lettie, promptly. “I see what you want, Hiram,” she added, and\r\nquickly adjusted the loop.\r\n\r\n“Now, when you swing out over the bank, Sister will grab you, and steady\r\nyou. It will be all right if you have a care. Now!” cried Hiram.\r\n\r\nLettie Bronson showed no fear at all as he drew her up and she swung\r\nout of the boat over the swiftly-running current. Hiram laid along the\r\ntree-trunk in an easy position, and began swinging the girl at the end\r\nof the rope, like a pendulum.\r\n\r\nThe river bank being at least three feet higher than the surface of the\r\nwater; he did not have to shift the rope again as he swung the girl back\r\nand forth.\r\n\r\nSister, clinging with her left hand to the grapevine, leaned forward and\r\nclutched Lettie's hand. When she seized it, Sister backed away, and the\r\nswinging girl landed upright upon the bank.\r\n\r\n“Oh, that's fun!” Lettie cried, laughing, loosing herself from “the\r\nloop. Now you come, Mary Judson!”\r\n\r\nThus encouraged they responded one by one, and even the girl who had\r\nbroken down and cried agreed to be rescued by this simple means. The\r\nboatman then, after removing his shoes and stockings and rolling up his\r\ntrousers, stepped out upon the sunken rock and pushed off the boat.\r\n\r\nBut it was leaking badly. He dared not take aboard his passengers again,\r\nbut turned around and went down stream as fast as he could go so as to\r\nbeach the boat in a safe place.\r\n\r\n“Now how'll we get back to Scoville?” cried one of Lettie's friends. “I\r\ncan never walk that far.”\r\n\r\nSister had dropped back, shyly, behind Hiram, when he descended the\r\ntree. She had aided each girl ashore; but only Lettie had thanked her.\r\nNow she tugged at Hiram's sleeve.\r\n\r\n“Take 'em home in our wagon,” she whispered.\r\n\r\n“I can take you to Scoville--or to Miss Bronson's--in the farm wagon,”\r\n Hiram said, smiling. “You can sit on straw in the bottom and be\r\ncomfortable.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, a straw ride!” cried Lettie. “What fun! And he can drive us right\r\nto St. Beris--And think what the other girls will say and how they'll\r\nstare!”\r\n\r\nThe idea seemed a happy one to all the girls save the cry-baby, Myra\r\nCarroll. And her complaints were drowned in the laughter and chatter of\r\nthe others.\r\n\r\nHiram picked up the tools, Sister got the string of fish, and they set\r\nout for the Atterson farmhouse. Lettie chatted most of the way with\r\nHiram; but to Sister, walking on the other side of the young farmer, the\r\nWestern girl never said a word.\r\n\r\nAt the house it was the same. While Hiram was cleaning the wagon and\r\nputting a bed of straw into it, and currying the horse and gearing him\r\nto the wagon, Mrs. Atterson brought a crock of cookies out upon the\r\nporch and talked with the girls from St. Beris. Sister had run indoors\r\nand changed her shabby and soiled frock for a new gingham; but when she\r\ncame down to the porch, and stood bashfully in the doorway, none of the\r\ngirls from town spoke to her.\r\n\r\nHiram drove up with the farm-wagon. Most of the girls had accepted the\r\nadventure in the true spirit now, and they climbed into the wagon-bed\r\non the clean straw with laughter and jokes. But nobody invited Sister to\r\njoin the party.\r\n\r\nThe orphan looked wistfully after the wagon as Hiram drove out of\r\nthe yard. Then she turned, with trembling lip, to Mother Atterson:\r\n“She--she's awfully pretty,” she said, “and Hiram likes her. But\r\nshe--they're all proud, and I guess they don't think much of folks like\r\nus, after all.”\r\n\r\n“Shucks, Sister! we're just good as they be, every bit,” returned Mrs.\r\nAtterson, bruskly.\r\n\r\n“I know; mebbe we be,” admitted Sister, slowly. “But it don't feel so.”\r\n\r\nAnd perhaps Hiram had some such thought, too, after he had driven the\r\ngirls to the big boarding school in Scoville. For they all got out\r\nwithout even thanking him or bidding him good-bye--all save Lettie.\r\n\r\n“Really, we are a thousand times obliged to you, Hiram Strong,” she\r\nsaid, in her very best manner, and offering him her hand. “As the girls\r\nwere my guests I felt I must get them home again safely--and you were\r\nindeed a friend in need.”\r\n\r\nBut then she spoiled it utterly, by adding:\r\n\r\n“Now, how much do I owe you, Hiram?” and took out her purse. “Is two\r\ndollars enough?” This put Hiram right in his place. He saw plainly that,\r\nfriendly as the Bronsons were, they did not look upon a common farm-boy\r\nas their equal--not in social matters, at least.\r\n\r\n“I could not take anything for doing a neighbor a favor, Miss Bronson,”\r\n said Hiram, quietly. “Thank you. Good-day.”\r\n\r\nHiram drove back home feeling quite as depressed as Sister, perhaps.\r\nFinally he said to himself:\r\n\r\n“Well, some day I'll show 'em!”\r\n\r\nAfter that he put the matter out of his mind and refused to be troubled\r\nby thoughts of Lettie Bronson, or her attitude toward him.\r\n\r\nSpring was advancing apace now. Every day saw the development of bud,\r\nleaf and plant. Slowly the lowland was cleared and the brush and roots\r\nwere heaped in great piles, ready for the torch.\r\n\r\nHiram could not depend upon this six acres as their only piece of\r\ncorn, however. There was the four-acre lot between the barnyard and the\r\npasture in which he proposed to plant the staple crop.\r\n\r\nHe drew out the remainder of the coarse manure and spread it upon this\r\nland, as far as it would go. For enriching the remainder of the corn\r\ncrop he would have to depend upon a commercial fertilizer. He drew, too,\r\na couple of tons of lime to be used on this corn land, and left it in\r\nheaps to slake.\r\n\r\nAnd then, out of the clear sky of their progress, came a bolt as\r\nunexpected as could be. They had been less than a month upon the farm.\r\nUncle Jeptha had not been in his grave thirty days, and Hiram was just\r\ngetting into the work of running the place, with success looming ahead.\r\n\r\nHe had refused Mr. Bronson's offer of a position and had elected to\r\nstick by Mrs. Atterson. He had looked forward to nothing to disturb the\r\ncontract between them until the time should be fulfilled.\r\n\r\nYet one afternoon, while he was at work in the garden, Sister came out\r\nto him all in a flurry.\r\n\r\n“Mis' Atterson wants you! Mis' Atterson wants you!” cried the girl. “Oh,\r\nHiram! something dreadful's going to happen. I know, by the way Mis'\r\nAtterson looks. And I don' like the looks o' that man that's come to see\r\nher.”\r\n\r\nHiram unhooked the horse at the end of the row and left Sister to lead\r\nhim to the stable. He went into the house after knocking the mud off his\r\nboots.\r\n\r\nThere, sitting in the bright kitchen, was the sharp-featured,\r\nsnaky-looking man with whom Hiram had once talked in town. He knew his\r\nname was Pepper, and that he did something in the real estate line, and\r\ninsurance, and the like.\r\n\r\n“Jest listen to what this man says, Hiram,” said Mrs. Atterson, grimly.\r\n\r\n“My name's Pepper,” began the man, eyeing Hiram curiously.\r\n\r\n“So I hear,” returned the young farmer.\r\n\r\n“Before old Mr. Atterson died we got to talking one day when he was in\r\ntown about his selling.”\r\n\r\n“Well?” returned Hiram. “You didn't say anything about that when you\r\noffered twelve hundred for this place.”\r\n\r\n“Well,” said the man, stubbornly, “that was a good offer.”\r\n\r\nHiram turned to Mrs. Atterson. “Do you want to sell for that price?”\r\n\r\n“No, I don't, Hi,” she said.\r\n\r\n“Then that settles it, doesn't it? Mrs. Atterson is the owner, and she\r\nknows her own mind.”\r\n\r\n“I made Uncle Jeptha a better offer,” said Mr. Pepper, “and I'll make\r\nMrs. Atterson the same--sixteen hundred dollars. It's a run-down farm,\r\nof course----”\r\n\r\n“If Mrs. Atterson doesn't want to sell,” interrupted Hiram, but here his\r\nemployer intervened.\r\n\r\n“There's something more, Hi,” she said, her face working “strangely.\r\nTell him, you Pepper!”\r\n\r\n“Why, the old man gave me an option on the place, and I risked a twenty\r\ndollar bill on it. The option had--er--a year to run; dated February\r\ntenth last; and I've decided to take the option up,” said Mr. Pepper,\r\nhis shrewd little eyes dancing in their gaze from Hiram to the old lady\r\nand back again.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII. A HEAVY CLOUD\r\n\r\nNow, a rattlesnake is poisonous, but he gives fair warning; a swamp\r\nmoccasin lies in wait for the unwary and strikes without sign or sound.\r\nInto Hiram Strong's troubled mind came the thought that Mr. Pepper was\r\nstriking like his prototype of the swamps.\r\n\r\nA snaky sort of a man was Mr. Pepper--sly, a hand-rubber as he talked,\r\nwith a little, sickly grin playing about his thin, mean mouth. When he\r\nopened it Hiram almost expected to see a forked tongue run out.\r\n\r\nAt least, of one thing was the young farmer sure: Mr. Pepper was no more\r\nto be trusted than a serpent. Therefore, he did not take a word that the\r\nman said on trust.\r\n\r\nHe recovered from the shock which the statement of the real estate man\r\nhad caused, and he uttered no expression of either surprise, or trouble.\r\nMrs. Atterson he could see was vastly disturbed by the statement; but\r\nsomebody had to keep a cool bead in this matter.\r\n\r\n“Let's see your option,” Hiram demanded, bruskly.\r\n\r\n“Why--if Mrs. Atterson wishes to see it----”\r\n\r\n“You show it to Hi, you Pepper-man,” snapped the old lady. “I wouldn't\r\ndo a thing without his advice.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, well, if you consider a boy's advice material----”\r\n\r\n“I know Hi's honest,” declared the old lady, tartly. “And that's what\r\nI'm sure you ain't! Besides,” she added, sadly, “Hi's as much interested\r\nin this thing as I be. If the farm's got to be sold, it puts Hi out of a\r\njob.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, very well,” said the real estate man, and he drew a rather soiled,\r\nfolded paper from his inner pocket.\r\n\r\nHe seemed to hesitate the fraction of a second about showing the paper.\r\nIt increased Hi's suspicion--this hesitancy. If the man had a perfectly\r\ngood option on the farm, why didn't he go about the matter boldly?\r\n\r\nBut when he got the paper in his own hands he could see nothing wrong\r\nwith it. It seemed written in straight-forward language, the signatures\r\nwere clear enough, and as he had seen and read Uncle Jeptha's will,\r\nhe was quite sure that this was the old man's signature to the option\r\nwhich, for the sum of twenty dollars in hand paid to him, he agreed to\r\nsell his farm, situated so-and-so, for sixteen hundred dollars, cash,\r\nsame to be paid over within one year of date.\r\n\r\n“Of course,” said Hiram, slowly, handing back the paper--indeed, Pepper\r\nhad kept the grip of his forefinger and thumb on it all the time--“Of\r\ncourse, Mrs. Atterson's lawyer must see this before she agrees to\r\nanything.”\r\n\r\n“Why, Hiram! I ain't got no lawyer,” exclaimed the old lady.\r\n\r\n“Go to Mr. Strickland, who made Uncle Jeptha's will,” Hiram said to her.\r\nThen he turned to Pepper:\r\n\r\n“What's the name of the witness to that old man's signature?”\r\n\r\n“Abel Pollock.”\r\n\r\n“Oh! Henry's father?”\r\n\r\n“Yes. He's got a son named Henry.”\r\n\r\n“And who's the Notary Public?”\r\n\r\n“Caleb Schell. He keeps the store just at the crossroads as you go into\r\ntown.”\r\n\r\n“I remember the store,” said Hiram, thoughtfully.\r\n\r\n“But Hiram!” cried Mrs. Atterson, “I don't want to sell the farm.”\r\n\r\n“We'll be sure this paper is all straight before you do sell, Mrs.\r\nAtterson.”\r\n\r\n“Why, I just won't sell!” she exclaimed. “Uncle Jeptha never said\r\nnothing in his will about giving this option. And that lawyer says that\r\nin a couple of years the farm will be worth a good deal more than this\r\nPepper offers.”\r\n\r\n“Why, Mrs. Atterson!” exclaimed the real estate man, cheerfully, “as\r\nproperty is selling in this locality now, sixteen hundred dollars is a\r\nmighty good offer for your farm. You ask anybody. Why, Uncle Jeptha knew\r\nit was; otherwise he wouldn't have given me the option, for he didn't\r\nbelieve I'd come up with the price. He knew it was a high offer.”\r\n\r\n“And if it's worth so much to you, why isn't it worth more to Mrs.\r\nAtterson to keep?” demanded Hiram, sharply.\r\n\r\n“Ah! that's my secret--why I want it,” said Pepper, nodding. “Leave that\r\nto me. If I get bit by buying it, I shall have to suffer for my lack of\r\nwisdom.”\r\n\r\n“You ain't bought it yet--you Pepper,” snapped Mrs. Atterson.\r\n\r\n“But I'm going to buy it, ma'am,” replied he, rather viciously, as he\r\nstood up, ready to depart. “I shall expect to hear from you no later\r\nthan Monday.”\r\n\r\n“I won't sell it!”\r\n\r\n“You'll have to. If you refuse to sign I'll go to the Chancery Court.\r\nI'll make you.”\r\n\r\n“Well. Mebbe you will. But I don't know. I never was made to do anything\r\nyet. By no man named Pepper--you can take that home with you,” she flung\r\nafter him as he walked out and climbed into the buggy.\r\n\r\nBut whereas Mrs. Atterson showed anger, Hiram went back to work in the\r\nfield with a much deeper feeling racking his mind. If the option was all\r\nright--and of course it must be--this would settle their occupancy of\r\nthe farm.\r\n\r\nOf course he could not hold Mrs. Atterson to her contract. She could not\r\nhelp the situation that had now arisen.\r\n\r\nHis Spring's work had gone for nothing. Sixteen hundred dollars, even in\r\ncash, would not be any great sum for the old lady. And she had burdened\r\nherself with the support of Sister--and with Old Lem Camp, too!\r\n\r\n“Surely, I can't be a burden on her. I'll have to hustle around and find\r\nanother job. I wonder if Mr. Bronson would take me on now?”\r\n\r\nBut he knew that the Westerner already had a man who suited him, since\r\nHiram had refused the chance Bronson offered. And, then, Lettie had\r\nshown that she felt he had not appreciated their offer. Perhaps her\r\nfather felt the same way.\r\n\r\nBesides, Hiram had a secret wish not to put himself under obligation\r\nto the Bronsons. This feeling may have sprung from a foolish source;\r\nnevertheless it was strong with the young farmer.\r\n\r\nIt looked very much to him as though this sudden turn of circumstances\r\nwas “a facer”. If Mrs. Atterson had to sell the farm he was likely to be\r\nthrown on his own resources again.\r\n\r\nFor his own selfish sake Hiram was worried, too. After all, he would\r\nbe unable to “make good” and to show people that he could make the old,\r\nrun-down farm pay a profit to its owner.\r\n\r\nBut Hiram Strong couldn't believe it.\r\n\r\nThe more he milled over the thing in his mind, the less he understood\r\nwhy Uncle Jeptha, who was of acute mind right up to the hour of his\r\ndeath, so all the neighbors said, should have neglected to speak about\r\nthe option he had given Pepper on the farm.\r\n\r\nAnd here they were, right in the middle of the Spring work, with crops\r\nin the ground and--as Mrs. Atterson agreed--it would be too late to go\r\nhunting a farm for this present season.\r\n\r\nBut Hiram kept to work. He had Sister and Old Lem Camp out in the\r\ngarden, hand-weeding and thinning the carrots, onions, and other tender\r\nplants. That Saturday he went through the entire garden--that part\r\nalready planted--with either the horse cultivator, or his wheel-hoe.\r\n\r\nIn planting parsnips, carrots, and other slow-germinating seeds, he had\r\nmixed a few radish seed in the seeding machine; these sprang up quickly\r\nand defined the rows, so that the space between rows could be cultivated\r\nbefore the other plants had scarcely broke the surface of the soil.\r\n\r\nNow these radish were beginning to be big enough to pull. Hiram brought\r\nin a few bunches for their dinner on Saturday--the first fruits of the\r\ngarden.\r\n\r\n“Now, I dunno why it is,” said Mrs. Atterson, complacently, after\r\nsetting her teeth in the first radish and relishing its crispness,\r\n“but this seems a whole lot better than the radishes we used to buy in\r\nCrawberry. I 'spect what's your very own always seems better than other\r\nfolks's,” and she sighed and shook her head.\r\n\r\nShe was thinking of the thing she had to face on Monday. Hiram hated to\r\nsee them all so downhearted. Sister's eyes were red from weeping; Old\r\nLem Camp sat at the table, muttering and playing with his food again\r\ninstead of eating.\r\n\r\nBut Hiram felt as though he could not give up to the disaster that had\r\ncome to them. The thought that--in some way--Pepper was taking an unfair\r\nadvantage of Mother Atterson knocked continually at the door of his\r\nmind.\r\n\r\nHe went over, to himself, all that had passed in the kitchen the day\r\nbefore when the real estate man had come to speak with Mrs. Atterson.\r\nHow had Pepper spoken about the option? Hadn't there been some hesitancy\r\nin the fellow's manner--in his speech, indeed? Just what had Pepper\r\nsaid? Hiram concentrated his mind upon this one thing. What had the man\r\nsaid?\r\n\r\n“The option had--er--one year to run.”\r\n\r\nThose were the fellow's very words. He hesitated before he pronounced\r\nthe length of time. And he was not a man who, in speaking, had any\r\nstammering of tongue.\r\n\r\nWhy had he hesitated? Why should it trouble him to state the time limit\r\nof the option?\r\n\r\nWas it because he was speaking a falsehood?\r\n\r\nThe thought stung Hiram like a thorn in the flesh. He put away the tool\r\nwith which he was working, slipped on a coat, and started for Henry\r\nPollock's house, which lay not more than half a mile from the Atterson\r\nfarm, across the fields.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX. THE REASON WHY\r\n\r\nHIRAM found Abel Pollock mending harness in the shed. Hiram opened his\r\nbusiness bluntly, and told the farmer what was up. Mr. Pollock scratched\r\nhis head, listened attentively, and then sat down to digest the news.\r\n\r\n“You gotter move--jest when you've got rightly settled on that place?”\r\n he demanded. “Well, that's 'tarnal bad! And from what Henry tells me,\r\nyou're a young feller with idees, too.”\r\n\r\n“I don't care so much for myself,” Hiram hastened to say. “It's Mrs.\r\nAtterson I'm thinking about. And she had just made up her mind that she\r\nwas anchored for the rest of her life. Besides, I don't think it is a\r\nwise thing to sell the property at that price.”\r\n\r\n“No. I wouldn't sell if I was her, for no sixteen hundred dollars.”\r\n\r\n“But she's got to, you see, Mr. Pollock. Pepper has the option signed by\r\nher Uncle Jeptha----”\r\n\r\n“Jeptha Atterson was no fool,” interrupted Pollock. “I can't understand\r\nhis giving an option on the farm, with all this talk of the railroad\r\ncrossing the river.”\r\n\r\n“But, Mr. Pollock!” exclaimed Hiram, eagerly, “you must know all about\r\nthis option. You signed as a witness to Uncle Jeptha's signature.”\r\n\r\n“No! you don't mean that?” exclaimed the farmer. “My name to it, too?”\r\n\r\n“Yes. And it was signed before Caleb Schell the notary public.”\r\n\r\n“So it was--so it was, boy!” declared the other, suddenly smiting his\r\nknee. “I remember I witnessed Uncle Jeptha's signature once. But that\r\nwas way back there in the winter--before he was took sick.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, sir?” said Hiram, eagerly.\r\n\r\n“That was an option on the old farm. So it was. But goodness me, boy,\r\nPepper must have got him to renew it, or something. That option wouldn't\r\nhave run till now.”\r\n\r\nHiram told him the date the paper was executed.\r\n\r\n“That's right, by Jo! It was in February.”\r\n\r\n“And it was for a year?”\r\n\r\nMr. Pollock stared at him in silence, evidently thinking deeply.\r\n\r\n“If you remember all about it, then,” Hiram continued, “it's hardly\r\nworth while going to Mr. Schell, I suppose.”\r\n\r\n“I remember, all right,” said Pollock, slowly. “It was all done right\r\nthere in Cale Schell's store. It was one rainy afternoon. There was\r\nseveral of us sitting around Cale's stove. Pepper was one of us. In\r\ncomes Uncle Jeptha. Pepper got after him right away, but sort of on the\r\nquiet, to one side.\r\n\r\n“I heard 'em. Pepper had made him an offer for the farm that was 'way\r\ndown low, and the old man laughed at him.\r\n\r\n“We hadn't none of us heard then the talk that came later about the\r\nrailroad. But Pepper has a brother-in-law who's in the office of the\r\ncompany, and he thinks he gits inside information.\r\n\r\n“So, for some reason, he thought the railroad was going to touch\r\nUncle Jeptha's farm. O' course, it ain't. It's goin' over the river by\r\nAyertown.\r\n\r\n“I don't see what Pepper wants to take up the option for, anyway. Unless\r\nhe sees that you're likely to make suthin' out o' the old place, and\r\nmebbe he's got a city feller on the string, to buy it.”\r\n\r\n“It doesn't matter what his reason is. Mrs. Atterson doesn't want to\r\nsell, and if that option is all right, she must,” said Hiram. “And you\r\nare sure Uncle Jeptha gave it for twelve months?”\r\n\r\n“Twelve months?” ejaculated Pollock, suddenly. “Why--no--that don't seem\r\nright,” stammered the farmer, scratching his head.\r\n\r\n“But that's the way the option reads.”\r\n\r\n“Well--mebbe. I didn't just read it myself--no, sir. They jest says to\r\nme:\r\n\r\n“'Come here, Pollock, and witness these signatures' So, I done\r\nit--that's all. But I see Cale put on his specs and read the durn thing\r\nthrough before he stamped it. Yes, sir. Cale's the carefulest notary\r\npublic we ever had around here.\r\n\r\n“Say!” said Mr. Pollock. “You go to Cale and ask him. It don't seem to\r\nme the old man give Pepper so long a time.”\r\n\r\n“For how long was the option to run, then?” queried Hiram, excitedly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“Wal, I wouldn't wanter say. I don't wanter git inter trouble with no\r\nneighbor. If Cale says a year is all right, then I'll say so, too. I\r\nwouldn't jest trust my memory.”\r\n\r\n“But there is some doubt in your mind, Mr. Pollock?”\r\n\r\n“There is. A good deal of doubt,” the farmer assured him. “But you ask\r\nCale.”\r\n\r\nThis was all that Hiram could get out of the elder Pollock. It was not\r\nvery comforting. The young farmer was of two minds whether he should see\r\nCaleb Schell, or not.\r\n\r\nBut when he got back to the house for supper, and saw the doleful faces\r\nof the three waiting there, he couldn't stand inaction.\r\n\r\n“If you don't mind, I want to go to town tonight, Mrs. Atterson,” he\r\ntold the old lady.\r\n\r\n“All right, Hiram. I expect you've got to look out for yourself, boy.\r\nIf you can get another job, you take it. It's a 'tarnal shame you didn't\r\ntake up with that Bronson's offer when he come here after you.”\r\n\r\n“You needn't feel so,” said Hiram. “You're no more at fault than I am.\r\nThis thing just happened--nobody could foretell it. And I'm just as\r\nsorry as I can be for you, Mother Atterson.”\r\n\r\nThe old woman wiped her eyes.\r\n\r\n“Well, Hi, there's other things in this world to worry over besides\r\ngravy, I find,” she said. “Some folks is born for trouble, and mebbe\r\nwe're some of that kind.”\r\n\r\nIt was not exactly Mr. Pollock's doubts that sent Hiram Strong down\r\nto the crossroads store that evening. For the farmer had seemed so\r\nuncertain that the boy couldn't trust to his memory at all.\r\n\r\nNo. It was Hiram's remembrance of Pepper's stammering when he spoke\r\nabout the option. He hesitated to pronounce the length of time the\r\noption had been drawn for. Was it because he knew there was some trick\r\nabout the time-limit?\r\n\r\nHad the real estate man fooled old Uncle Jeptha in the beginning? The\r\ndead man had been very shrewd and careful. Everybody said so.\r\n\r\nHe was conscious and of acute mind right up to his death. If there was\r\nan option on the farm be surely would have said something about it to\r\nMr. Strickland, or to some of the neighbors.\r\n\r\nIt looked to Hiram as though the old farmer must have believed that the\r\noption had expired before the day of his death.\r\n\r\nHad Pepper only got the old man's promise for a shorter length of time,\r\nbut substituted the paper reading “one year” when it was signed? Was\r\nthat the mystery?\r\n\r\nHowever, Hiram could not see how that would help Mrs. Atterson, for even\r\ntestimony of witnesses who heard the discussion between the dead man and\r\nthe real estate agent, could not controvert a written instrument. The\r\nyoung fellow knew that.\r\n\r\nHe harnessed the old horse to the light wagon and drove to the\r\ncrossroads store kept by Caleb Schell. Many of the country people liked\r\nto trade with this man because his store was a social gathering-place.\r\n\r\nAround a hot stove in the winter, and a cold stove at this time of year,\r\nthe men gathered to discuss the state of the country, local politics,\r\ntheir neighbors' business, and any other topic which was suggested to\r\ntheir more or less idle minds.\r\n\r\nOn the outskirts of the group of older loafers, the growing crop of men\r\nwho would later take their places in the soap-box forum lingered; while\r\nsky-larking about the verge of the crowd were smaller boys who were\r\nlearning no good, to say the least, in attaching themselves to the older\r\nmembers of the company.\r\n\r\nThere will always be certain men in every community who take delight in\r\npoisoning the minds of the younger generation. We muzzle dogs, or shoot\r\nthem when they go mad. The foul-mouthed man is far more vicious than the\r\ndog, and should be impounded.\r\n\r\nHiram hitched his horse to the rack before the store and entered the\r\ncrowded place. The fumes of tobacco smoke, vinegar, cheese, and various\r\nother commodities gave a distinctive flavor to Caleb Schell's store--and\r\nnot a pleasant one, to Hiram's mind.\r\n\r\nOrdinarily he would have made any purchases he had to make, and gone out\r\nat once. But Schell was busy with several customers at the counter and\r\nhe was forced to wait a chance to speak with the old man.\r\n\r\nOne of the first persons Hiram saw in the store was young Pete\r\nDickerson, hanging about the edge of the crowd. Pete scowled at him and\r\nmoved away. One of the men holding down a cracker-keg sighted Hiram and\r\nhailed him in a jovial tone:\r\n\r\n“Hi, there, Mr. Strong! What's this we been hearin' about you? They\r\nsay you had a run-in with Sam Dickerson. We been tryin' to git the\r\npertic'lars out o' Pete, here, but he don't seem ter wanter talk about\r\nit,” and the man guffawed heartily.\r\n\r\n“Hear ye made Sam give back the tools he borrowed of the old man?” said\r\nanother man, whom Hiram knew to be Mrs. Larriper's son-in-law.\r\n\r\n“You are probably misinformed,” said Hiram, quietly. “I know no reason\r\nwhy Mr. Dickerson and I should have trouble--unless other neighbors make\r\ntrouble for us.”\r\n\r\n“Right, boy--right!” called Cale Schell, from behind the counter, where\r\nhe could hear and comment upon all that went on in the middle of the\r\nroom, despite the attention he had to give to his customers.\r\n\r\n“Well, if you can git along with Sam and Pete, you'll do well,” laughed\r\nanother of the group.\r\n\r\nThe Dickersons seemed to be in disfavor in the community, and nobody\r\ncared whether Pete repeated what was said to his father, or not.\r\n\r\n“I was told,” pursued the first speaker, screwing up one eye and\r\ngrinning at Hiram, “that you broke Sam's gun over his head and chased\r\nPete a mile. That right, son?”\r\n\r\n“You will get no information from me,” returned Hiram, tartly.\r\n\r\n“Why, Pete ought to be big enough to lick you alone, Strong,” continued\r\nthe tantalizer. “Hey, Pete! Don't sneak out. Come and tell us why you\r\ndidn't give this chap the lickin' you said you was going to?”\r\n\r\nPete only glared at him and slunk out of the store. Hiram turned his\r\nback on the whole crowd and waited at the end of the counter for Mr.\r\nSchell. The storekeeper was a tall, portly man, with a gray mustache and\r\nside-whiskers, and a high bald forehead.\r\n\r\n“What can I do for you, Mr. Strong?” he asked, finally having got rid of\r\nthe customers who preceded Hiram.\r\n\r\nHiram, in a low voice, explained his mission. Schell nodded his head at\r\nonce.\r\n\r\n“Oh, yes,” he said; “I remember about the option. I had forgotten it,\r\nfor a fact; but Pepper was in here yesterday talking about it. He had\r\nbeen to your house.”\r\n\r\n“Then, sir, to the best of your remembrance, the option is all right?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, certainly! Pollock witnessed it, and I put my seal on it. Yes, sir;\r\nPepper can make the old lady sell. It's too bad, if she wants to remain\r\nthere; but the price he is to pay isn't so bad----”\r\n\r\n“You have no reason to doubt the validity of the option?” cried Hiram,\r\nin desperation.\r\n\r\n“Assuredly not.”\r\n\r\n“Then why didn't Uncle Jeptha speak of it to somebody before he died, if\r\nthe option had not run out at that time?”\r\n\r\n“Humph!”\r\n\r\n“You grant the old man was of sound mind?”\r\n\r\n“Sound as a pine knot,” agreed the storekeeper, still reflective.\r\n\r\n“Then how is it he did not speak to his lawyer about the option when he\r\nsaw Mr. Strickland within an hour of his death?”\r\n\r\n“That does seem peculiar,” admitted the storekeeper, slowly.\r\n\r\n“And Mr. Pollock says he thinks there is something wrong about the\r\noption,” went on Hiram, eagerly.\r\n\r\n“Oh, Pollock! Pah!” returned Schell. “I don't suppose he even read it.”\r\n\r\n“But you did?”\r\n\r\n“Assuredly. I always read every paper. If they don't want me to know\r\nwhat the agreement is, they can take it to some other Notary,” declared\r\nthe storekeeper with a jolly laugh.\r\n\r\n“And you are sure that the option was to run a year?”\r\n\r\n“Of course the option's all right--Hold on! A year, did you say?\r\nWhy--seems to me--let's look this thing up,” concluded Caleb Schell,\r\nsuddenly.\r\n\r\nHe dived into his little office and produced a ledger from the safe.\r\nThis he slapped down on the counter between them.\r\n\r\n“I'm a careful man, I am,” he told Hiram. “And I flatter myself I've got\r\na good memory, too. Pepper was in here yesterday sputtering about the\r\noption and I remember now that he spoke of its running a year.\r\n\r\n“But it seems to me,” said Schell, pawing over the leaves of his ledger,\r\n“that the talk between him and old Uncle Jeptha was for a short time.\r\nThe old man was mighty cautious--mighty cautious.”\r\n\r\n“That's what Mr. Pollock says,” cried Hiram, eagerly.\r\n\r\n“But you've seen the option?\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“And it reads a year?\r\n\r\n“Oh, yes.”\r\n\r\n“Then how you going to get around that?” demanded Schell, with\r\nconviction.\r\n\r\n“But perhaps Uncle Jeptha signed the option thinking it was for a\r\nshorter time.”\r\n\r\n“That wouldn't help you none. The paper was signed. And why should\r\nPepper have buncoed him--at that time?”\r\n\r\n“Why should he be so eager to get the farm now?” asked Hiram.\r\n\r\n“Well, I'll tell you. It ain't out yet. But two or three days ago the\r\nrailroad board abandoned the route through Ayertown and it is agreed\r\nthat the new bridge will be built along there by your farm somewhere.\r\n\r\n“The river is as narrow there as it is anywhere for miles up and down,\r\nand they will stretch a bridge from the high bank on your side, across\r\nthe meadows, to the high bank on the other side. It will cut out grades,\r\nyou see. That's what has started Pepper up to grab off the farm while\r\nthe option is valid.”\r\n\r\n“But, Mr. Schell, is the option valid?” cried Hiram, anxiously.\r\n\r\n“I don't see how you're going to get around it. Ah! here's the place.\r\nWhen I have sealed a paper I make a note of it--what the matter was\r\nabout and who the contracting parties were. I've done that for years.\r\nLet--me--see.”\r\n\r\nHe adjusted his spectacles. He squinted at the page, covered closely\r\nwith writing. Hiram saw him whispering the words he read to himself.\r\nSuddenly the blood flooded into the old man's face, and he looked up\r\nwith a start at his interrogator.\r\n\r\n“Do you mean to say that option's for a year? he demanded.\r\n\r\n“That is the way it reads--now,” whispered Hiram, watching him closely.\r\n\r\nThe old man turned the book around slowly on the counter. His stubbed\r\nfinger pointed to the two or three scrawled lines written in a certain\r\nplace.\r\n\r\nHiram read them slowly, with beating heart.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX. AN ENEMY IN THE DARK\r\n\r\nThe whispered conference between Hiram Strong and the storekeeper could\r\nnot be heard by the curious crowd around the cold stove; nor did it last\r\nfor long.\r\n\r\nCaleb Schell finally closed his ledger and put it away. Hiram shook\r\nhands with him and walked out.\r\n\r\nOn the platform outside, which was illuminated by a single smoky\r\nlantern, a group of small boys were giggling, and they watched Hiram\r\nunhitch the old horse and climb into the spring wagon with so much\r\nhilarity that the young farmer expected some trick.\r\n\r\nThe horse started off all right, he missed nothing from the wagon, and\r\nso he supposed that he was mistaken. The boys had merely been laughing\r\nat him because he was a stranger.\r\n\r\nBut as Hiram got some few yards from the hitching rack, the seat was\r\nsuddenly pulled from under him, and he was left sprawling on his back in\r\nthe bottom of the wagon.\r\n\r\nA yell of derision from the crowd outside the store assured him that\r\nthis was the cause of the boys' hilarity. Luckily his old horse was of\r\nquiet disposition, and he stopped dead in his tracks when the seat flew\r\nout of the back of the wagon.\r\n\r\nA joke is a joke. No use in showing wrath over this foolish amusement of\r\nthe crossroads boys. But Hiram got a little the best of them, after all.\r\n\r\nThe youngsters had scattered when the “accident” occurred. Hiram,\r\ngetting out to pick up the seat, found the end of a strong hemp line\r\nfastened to it. The other end was tied to the hitching rack in front of\r\nthe store.\r\n\r\nInstead of casting off the line from the seat, Hiram walked back to the\r\nstore and cast that end off.\r\n\r\n“At any rate, I'm in a good coil of hemp rope,” he said to one of the\r\nmen who had come out to see the fun. “The fellow who owns it can come\r\nand prove property; but I shall ask a few questions of him.”\r\n\r\nThere was no more laughter. The young farmer walked back to his wagon,\r\nset up the seat again, and drove on.\r\n\r\nThe roadway was dark, but having been used all his life to country\r\nroads at night, Hiram had no difficulty in seeing the path before him.\r\nBesides, the old horse knew his way home.\r\n\r\nHe drove on some eighth of a mile. Suddenly he felt that the wagon\r\nwas not running true. One of the wheels was yawing. He drew in the old\r\nhorse; but he was not quick enough.\r\n\r\nThe nigh forward wheel rolled off the end of the axle, and down came the\r\nwagon with a crash!\r\n\r\nHiram was thrown forward and came sprawling--on hands and knees--upon\r\nthe ground, while the wheel rolled into the ditch. He was little hurt,\r\nalthough the accident might have been serious.\r\n\r\nAnd in truth, he knew it to be no accident. A burr does not easily work\r\noff the end of an axle. He had greased the old wagon just before he\r\nstarted for the store, and he knew he had replaced each nut carefully.\r\n\r\nThis was a deliberately malicious trick--no boy's joke like the tying of\r\nthe rope to his wagon seat. And the axle was broken. Although he had\r\nno lantern he could see that the wagon could not be used again without\r\nbeing repaired.\r\n\r\n“Who did it?” was Hiram's unspoken question, as he slowly unharnessed\r\nthe old horse, and then dragged the broken wagon entirely out of the\r\nroad so that it would not be an obstruction for other vehicles.\r\n\r\nHis mind set instantly upon Pete Dickerson. He had not seen the boy\r\nwhen he came out of the crossroads store. If the fellow had removed this\r\nburr, he had done it without anybody seeing him, and had then run home.\r\n\r\nThe young farmer, much disturbed over this incident, mounted the back\r\nof the old horse, and paced home. He only told Mrs. Atterson that he had\r\nmet with an accident and that the light wagon would have to be repaired\r\nbefore it could be used again.\r\n\r\nThat necessitated their going to town on Monday in the heavy wagon. And\r\nHiram dragged the spring wagon to the blacksmith shop for repairs, on\r\nthe way.\r\n\r\nBut before that, the enemy in the dark had struck again. When Hiram\r\nwent to the barnyard to water the stock, Sunday morning, he found that\r\nsomebody had been bothering the pump.\r\n\r\nThe bucket, or pump-valve, was gone. He had to take it apart, cut a new\r\nvalve out of sole leather, and put the pump together again.\r\n\r\n“We'll have to get a cross dog, if we remain here,” he told Mrs.\r\nAtterson. “There is somebody in the neighborhood who means us harm.”\r\n\r\n“Them Dickersons!” exclaimed Mrs. Atterson.\r\n\r\n“Perhaps. That Pete, maybe. If I once caught him up to his tricks I'd\r\nmake him sorry enough.”\r\n\r\n“Tell the constable, Hi,” cried Sister, angrily.\r\n\r\n“That would make trouble for his folks. Maybe they don't know just how\r\nmean Pete is. A good thrashing--and the threat of another every time he\r\ndid anything mean--would do him lots more good.”\r\n\r\nThis wasn't nice Sunday work, but it was too far to carry water from the\r\nhouse to the horse trough, so Hiram had to repair the pump.\r\n\r\nOn Monday morning he routed out Sister and Mr. Camp at daybreak. He had\r\nbeen up and out for an hour himself, and on a bench under the shed he\r\nhad heaped two or three bushels of radishes which he had pulled and\r\nwashed, ready for bunching.\r\n\r\nHe showed his helpers how the pretty scarlet balls were to be bunched,\r\nand found that Sister took hold of the work with nimble fingers, while\r\nMr. Camp did very well at the unaccustomed task.\r\n\r\n“I don't know, Hi,” said Mrs. Atterson, despondently, “that it's worth\r\nwhile your trying to sell any of the truck, if we're going to leave here\r\nso soon.”\r\n\r\n“We haven't left yet,” he returned, trying to speak cheerfully. “And you\r\nmight as well get every penny back that you can. Perhaps an arrangement\r\ncan be made whereby we can stay and harvest the garden crop, at any\r\nrate.”\r\n\r\n“You can make up your mind that that Pepper man won't give us any\r\nleeway; he isn't that kind,” declared Mother Atterson, with conviction.\r\n\r\nHiram made a quick sale of the radishes at several of the stores, where\r\nhe got eighteen cents a dozen bunches; but some he sold at the big\r\nboarding-school--St. Beris--at a retail price.\r\n\r\n“You can bring any other fresh vegetables you may have from time\r\nto time,” the housekeeper told him. “Nobody ever raised any early\r\nvegetables about Scoville before. They are very welcome.”\r\n\r\n“Once we get a-going,” said Hiram to Mrs. Atterson, “you or Sister can\r\ndrive in with the spring wagon and dispose of the surplus vegetables.\r\nAnd you might get a small canning outfit--they come as cheap as fifteen\r\ndollars--and put up tomatoes, corn, peas, beans, and other things. Good\r\ncanned stuff always sells well.”\r\n\r\n“Good Land o' Goshen, Hiram!” exclaimed the old lady, in desperation.\r\n“You talk jest as though we were going to stay on the farm.”\r\n\r\n“Well, let's go and see Mr. Strickland,” replied the young farmer, and\r\nthey set out for the lawyer's office.\r\n\r\nMrs. Atterson sat in the ante-room while Hiram asked to speak with the\r\nold lawyer in private for a minute. The conference was not for long, and\r\nwhen Hiram came back to his employer he said:\r\n\r\n“Mr. Strickland has sent his junior clerk out for Pepper. He thinks we'd\r\nbetter talk the matter over quietly. And he wants to see the option,\r\ntoo.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, Hiram! There ain't no hope, is there?” groaned the old lady.\r\n\r\n“Well, I tell you what!” exclaimed the young fellow, “we won't give in\r\nto him until we have to. Of course, if you refuse to sign a deed he\r\ncan go to chancery and in the end you will have to pay the costs of the\r\naction.\r\n\r\n“But perhaps, even at that, it might be well to hold him off until you\r\nhave got the present crop out of the ground.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, I won't go to law,” said Mrs. Atterson, decidedly. “No good ever\r\ncome of that.”\r\n\r\nAfter a time Mr. Strickland invited them both into his private office.\r\nThe attorney spoke quietly of other matters while they waited for\r\nPepper.\r\n\r\nBut the real estate man did not appear. By and by Mr. Strickland's clerk\r\ncame back with the report that Pepper had been called away suddenly on\r\nimportant business.\r\n\r\n“They tell me he went Saturday,” said the clerk. “He may not be back\r\nfor a week. But he said he was going to buy the Atterson place when he\r\nreturned--he's told several people around town so.”\r\n\r\n“Ah!” said Mr. Strickland, slowly. “Then he has left that threat\r\nhanging, like the Sword of Damocles--over Mrs. Atterson's head?”\r\n\r\n“I don't know nothin' about that sword, Mr. Strickland, nor no\r\nother sword, 'cept a rusty one that my father carried when he was a\r\nhoss-sodger in the Rebellion,” declared Mother Atterson, nervously. “But\r\nif that Pepper man's got one belonging to Mr. Damocles, I shouldn't be\r\nat all surprised. That Pepper looked to me like a man that would take\r\nanything he could lay his hands on--if he warn't watched!”\r\n\r\n“Which is a true and just interpretation of Pepper's character, I\r\nbelieve,” observed the lawyer, smiling.\r\n\r\n“And we've got to give up the farm at his say-so--at any time?” demanded\r\nthe old lady.\r\n\r\n“If his option is good,” said Mr. Strickland. “But I want to see the\r\npaper--and I can assure you, Mrs. Atterson, that I shall subject it to\r\nthe closest possible scrutiny.\r\n\r\n“There is a possibility that Pepper's option may be questioned before\r\nthe courts. Do not build too many hopes on this,” he added, quickly,\r\nseeing the old lady's face light up.\r\n\r\n“You have a very good champion in this young man,” and the lawyer nodded\r\nat Hiram.\r\n\r\n“He suspected all was not right with the option and he has dug up the\r\nfact that the witness to your uncle's signature, and the man before whom\r\nthe paper was attested, both believed the option was for a short time.\r\n\r\n“Caleb Schell's book shows that it was for thirty days. Uncle Jeptha\r\nundoubtedly thought it was for that length of time and therefore the\r\noption expired several days before he died.\r\n\r\n“Mr. Pepper may have fallen under temptation. He considered heretofore,\r\nlike everybody else, that the railroad would pass us by in this section.\r\nPepper gambled twenty dollars on its coming along the boundary of the\r\nAtterson farm--between you and Darrell's tract--and thought he had lost.\r\n\r\n“Then suddenly the railroad board turned square around and voted for the\r\ncondemnation of the original route. Pepper remembered the option he had\r\nrisked twenty dollars on. If it was originally for thirty days, it was\r\nvoid, of course; but Uncle Jeptha is dead, and he hopes perhaps, that\r\nnobody else will dispute the validity of it.”\r\n\r\n“It's a forgery, then?” cried Mrs. Atterson.\r\n\r\n“It may be a forgery. We do not know,” said the lawyer, hastily. “At any\r\nrate, he has the paper, and he is a shrewd rascal.”\r\n\r\nMrs. Atterson's face was a study.\r\n\r\n“Do you mean to tell me we have got to lose the farm?” she demanded.\r\n\r\n“My dear lady, that I cannot tell you. I must see this option. We must\r\nput it to the test----”\r\n\r\n“But Schell and Pollock will testify that the option was for thirty\r\ndays,” cried Hiram.\r\n\r\n“Perhaps. To the best of their remembrance and belief, it was for\r\nthirty days. A shrewd lawyer, however--and Pepper would employ a shrewd\r\none--would turn their evidence inside out.\r\n\r\n“No evidence--in theory, at least--can controvert a written instrument,\r\nsigned, sealed, and delivered. Even Cale Schell's memoranda book cannot\r\nbe taken as evidence, save in a contributory way. It is not direct. It\r\nis the carelessly scribbled record, in pencil, of a busy man.\r\n\r\n“No. If Pepper puts forward the option we have got to see if that\r\noption has been tampered with--the paper itself, I mean. If the fellow\r\nsubstituted a different instrument, at the time of signing, from the one\r\nUncle Jeptha thought he signed, you have no case--I tell you frankly, my\r\ndear lady.”\r\n\r\n“Then, it ain't no use. We got to lose the place, Hiram,” said Mrs.\r\nAtterson, when they left the lawyer's office.\r\n\r\n“I wouldn't lose heart. If Pepper is scared, he may not trouble you\r\nagain.”\r\n\r\n“It's got ten months more to run,” said she. “He can keep us guessin' all\r\nthat time.”\r\n\r\n“That is so,” agreed Hiram, nodding thoughtfully. “But, of course, as\r\nMr. Strickland says, by raising a doubt as to the validity of the option\r\nwe can hold him off for a while--maybe until we have made this year's\r\ncrop.”\r\n\r\n“It's goin' to make me lay awake o' nights,” sighed the old lady. “And\r\nI thought I'd got through with that when I stopped worryin' about the\r\ngravy.”\r\n\r\n“Well, we won't talk about next year,” agreed Hiram. “I'll do the best I\r\ncan for you through this season, if Pepper will let us alone. We've got\r\nthe bottom land practically cleared; we might as well plough it and put\r\nin the corn there. If we make a crop you'll get all your money back and\r\nmore. Mr. Strickland told me privately that the option, unless it read\r\nthat way, would not cover the crops in the ground. And I read the option\r\ncarefully. Crops were not mentioned.”\r\n\r\nSo it was decided to go ahead with the work as already planned;\r\nbut neither the young farmer, nor his employer, could look forward\r\ncheerfully to the future.\r\n\r\nThe uncertainty of what Pepper would eventually do was bound to be in\r\ntheir thought, day and night.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI. THE WELCOME TEMPEST\r\n\r\nTo some youths this matter of the option would have been such a clog\r\nthat they would have lost interest and slighted the work. But not so\r\nwith Hiram Strong.\r\n\r\nHe counted this day a lost one, however; he hated to leave the farm for\r\na minute when there was so much to do.\r\n\r\nBut the next morning he got the plow into the four-acre corn lot; and\r\nhe did nothing but the chores that week until the ground was entirely\r\nplowed. Then Henry Pollock came over and gave him another day's work and\r\nthey finished grubbing the lowland.\r\n\r\nThe rubbish was piled in great heaps down there, ready for burning. As\r\nlong as the rain held off, Hiram did not put fire to the bush-heaps.\r\n\r\nBut early in the following week the clouds began to gather in a quarter\r\nfor rain, and late in the afternoon, when the air was still, he took a\r\ncan of coal oil, and with Sister and Mr. Camp, and even Mrs. Atterson,\r\nat his heels, went down to the riverside to burn the brush heaps.\r\n\r\n“There's not much danger of the fire spreading to the woods; but if it\r\nshould,” Hiram said, warningly, “it might, at this time of year, do your\r\ntimber a couple of hundred dollars' worth of damage.”\r\n\r\n“Goodness me!” exclaimed Mother Atterson. “It does seem ridiculous to\r\nhear you talk that a-way. I never owned nothin' but a little bit of\r\nfurniture before, and I expected the boarders to tear that all to\r\npieces. I'm beginning to feel all puffed up and wealthy.”\r\n\r\nHiram cut them all green pineboughs for beaters, and then set the fires,\r\none after another. There were more than twenty of the great piles and\r\nsoon the river bottom, from bend to bend, was filled with rolling clouds\r\nof smoke. As the dusk dropped, the yellow glare of the fire illuminated\r\nthe scene.\r\n\r\nSister clapped her hands and cried:\r\n\r\n“Ain't this bully? It beats the Fourth of July celebration in Crawberry.\r\nOh, I'd rather be on the farm than go to heaven!”\r\n\r\nThey had brought their supper with them, and leaving the others to watch\r\nthe fires, and see that the grass did not tempt the flames to the edge\r\nof the wood, Hiram cast bait into the river and, in an hour, drew out\r\nenough mullet and “bull-heads” to satisfy them all, when they were\r\nbroiled over the hot coals of the first bonfire to be lighted.\r\n\r\nThey ate with much enjoyment. Between nine and ten o'clock the fires had\r\nall burned down to coals.\r\n\r\nA circle of burned-over grass and rubbish surrounded each fire. There\r\nseemed no possibility that the flames could spread to the mat of dry\r\nleaves on the side hill.\r\n\r\nSo they went home, a lantern guiding their feet over the rough path\r\nthrough the timber, stopping at the spring for a long, thirst-quenching\r\ndraught.\r\n\r\nThe sky was as black as ink. Now and again a faint flash in the westward\r\nproclaimed a tempest in that direction. But not a breath of wind was\r\nstirring, and the rain might not reach this section.\r\n\r\nA dull red glow was reflected on the clouds over the river-bottom. When\r\nHiram looked from his window, just as he was ready for bed, that glow\r\nseemed to have increased.\r\n\r\n“Strange,” he muttered. “It can't be that those fires have spread. There\r\nwas no chance for them to spread. I--don't--understand it!”\r\n\r\nHe sat at the window and stared out through the darkness. There was\r\nlittle wind as yet; it was a fact, however, that the firelight flickered\r\non the low-hung clouds with increasing radiance.\r\n\r\n“Am I mad?” demanded the young farmer, suddenly leaping up and drawing\r\non his garments again. “That fire is spreading.”\r\n\r\nHe dressed fully, and ran softly down the stairs and left the house.\r\nWhen he came out in the clear the glow had not receded. There was a fire\r\ndown the hillside, and it seemed increasing every moment.\r\n\r\nHe remembered the enemy in the dark, and without stopping to rouse the\r\nhousehold, ran on toward the woods, his heart beating heavily in his\r\nbosom.\r\n\r\nSlipping, falling at times, panting heavily because of the rough ground,\r\nHiram came at last through the more open timber to the brink of that\r\nsteep descent, at the bottom of which lay the smoky river-bottom.\r\n\r\nAnd indeed, the whole of the lowland seemed filled with stifling clouds\r\nof smoke. Yet, from a dozen places along the foot of the hill, yellow\r\nflames were starting up, kindling higher, and devouring as fast as might\r\nbe the leaves and tinder left from the wrack of winter.\r\n\r\nThe nearest bonfire had been a hundred yards from the foot of this hill.\r\nHis care, Hiram knew, had left no chance of the dull coals in any of the\r\ntwenty heaps spreading to the verge of the grove.\r\n\r\nMan's hand had done this. An enemy, waiting and watching until they had\r\nleft the field, had stolen down, gathered burning brands, and spread\r\nthem along the bottom of the hill, where the increasing wind might\r\nscatter the fire until the whole grove was in a blaze.\r\n\r\nNot only was Mrs. Atterson's timber in danger, but Darrell's tract\r\nand that lying beyond would be overwhelmed by the flames if they were\r\nallowed to spread.\r\n\r\nOn the other side, Dickerson had cut his timber a year or two before,\r\nclear to the river. The fire would not burn far over his line. Whoever\r\nhad done this dastardly act, Dickerson's property would not be damaged.\r\n\r\nBut Hiram lent no time to trouble. His work was cut out for him right\r\nhere and now--and well he knew it!\r\n\r\nHe had brought the small axe with him, having caught it up from the\r\ndoorstep. Now he used it to cut a green bough, and then ran with the\r\nlatter down the hill and set upon the fire-line like a madman.\r\n\r\nThe smoke, spread here and there by puffs of rising wind, half choked\r\nhim. It stung his eyes until they distilled water enough to blind him.\r\nHe thrashed and fought in the fumes and the murk of it, stumbling and\r\nslipping, one moment half-knee deep in quick-springing flames, the next\r\nalmost overpowered by the smudge that rose from the beaten mat of leaves\r\nand rubbish.\r\n\r\nIt was a lone fight. He had to do it all. There had been no time to\r\nrouse either the neighbors, or the rest of the family.\r\n\r\nIf he did not overcome these flames--and well he knew it--Mother\r\nAtterson would arise in the morning to see all her goodly timber\r\nscorched, perhaps ruined!\r\n\r\n“I must beat it out--beat it out!” thought Hiram, and the repetition\r\nof the words thrummed an accompaniment upon the drums of his ears as he\r\nthrashed away with a madman's strength.\r\n\r\nFor no sane person would have tackled such a hopeless task. Before\r\nhim the flames suddenly leaped six feet or more into the air. They\r\novertopped him as they writhed through a clump of green-briars. The wind\r\npuffed the flame toward him, and his face was scorched by the heat.\r\n\r\nHe lost his eyebrows completely, and the hair was crisped along the\r\nfront brim of his hat.\r\n\r\nThen with a laughing crackle, as though scorning his weakness, the\r\nflames ran up a climbing vine and the next moment wrapped a tall pine in\r\nlurid yellow.\r\n\r\nThis pine, like a huge torch, began to give off a thick, black smoke.\r\nWould some wakeful neighboring farmer, seeing it, know the danger that\r\nmenaced and come to Hiram's help?\r\n\r\nFor yards he had beaten flat the flames and stamped out every spark.\r\nBehind him was naught but rolling smoke. It was dark there. No flames\r\nwere eating up the slope.\r\n\r\nBut toward Darrell's tract the fire seemed on the increase. He could not\r\ncatch up with it. And this solitary, sentinel pine, ablaze now in all\r\nits head, threatened to fling sparks for a hundred yards.\r\n\r\nIf the wind continued to rise, the forest was doomed!\r\n\r\nHis green branch had burned to a crisp. He had lost his axe in the\r\ndarkness and the smoke, and now he tore another bough, by main strength,\r\nfrom its parent stem.\r\n\r\nHiram Strong worked as though inspired; but to no purpose in the end.\r\nFor the flames increased. Puff after puff of wind drove the fire on,\r\nscattering brands from the blazing pine; and now another, and another,\r\ntree caught. The glare of the conflagration increased.\r\n\r\nHe flung down the useless bough. Fire was all about him. He had to leap\r\nsuddenly to one side to escape a burst of flame that had caught in a\r\njungle of green-briars.\r\n\r\nThen, of a sudden, a crash of thunder rolled and reverberated through\r\nthe glen. Lightning for an instant lit up the meadows and the river.\r\nThe glare of it almost blinded the young farmer and, out of the line of\r\nfire, he sank to the earth and covered his eyes, seared by the sudden,\r\ncompelling light.\r\n\r\nAgain and again the thunder rolled, following the javelins of lightning\r\nthat seemed to dart from the clouds to the earth. The tempest, so long\r\nmuttering in the West, had come upon him unexpectedly, for he had given\r\nall his attention to the spreading fire.\r\n\r\nAnd now came the rain--no refreshing, sweet, saturating shower; but a\r\nthunderous, blinding fall of water that first set the burning woods to\r\nsteaming and then drowned out every spark of fire on upland as well as\r\nlowland.\r\n\r\nIt was a cloudburst--a downpour such as Hiram had seldom experienced\r\nbefore. Exhausted, he lay on the bank and let the pelting rain soak him\r\nto the skin.\r\n\r\nHe did not care. Half drowned by the beating rain, he only crowed his\r\ndelight at the downpour. Every spark of fire was flooded out. The danger\r\nwas past.\r\n\r\nHe finally arose, and staggered through the downpour to the house, only\r\nhappy that--by a merciful interposition of Providence--the peril had\r\nbeen overcome.\r\n\r\nHe tore off his clothing on the stoop, there in the pitch darkness, and\r\ncrept up to his bedroom where he rubbed himself down with a crash-towel,\r\nand finally tumbled into bed and slept like a log till broad daylight.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII. FIRST FRUITS\r\n\r\nFor the first time since they had come to the farm, Hiram was the\r\nlast to get up in the house. And when he came down to breakfast,\r\nstill trembling from the exertion of the previous night, Mrs. Atterson\r\nscreamed at the sight of him.\r\n\r\n“For the good Land o' Goshen!” she cried. “You look like a singed\r\nchicken, Hiram Strong! Whatever have you been doing to yourself?”\r\n\r\nHe told them of the fight he had had while they slept. But he could talk\r\nabout it jokingly now, although Sister was inclined to snivel a little\r\nover his danger.\r\n\r\n“That Dickerson boy ought to be lashed--Nine and thirty lashes--none too\r\nmuch--This sausage is good--humph!--and pancakes--fit for the gods--But\r\nhe'll come back--do more damage--the butter, yes I I want butter--and\r\nsyrup, though two spreads is reckless extravagance--Eh? eh? can't prove\r\nanything against that Dickerson lout?-well, mebbe not.”\r\n\r\nSo Old Lem Camp commented upon the affair. But Hiram could not prove\r\nthat the neighbor's boy had done any of these things which pointed to a\r\nmalicious enemy.\r\n\r\nThe young farmer began to wonder if he could not lay a trap, and so\r\nbring about his undoing.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the ground was in fit condition again (for the nights rain\r\nhad been heavy) Hiram scattered the lime he had planned to use upon\r\nthe four acres of land plowed for corn, and dragged it in with a\r\nspike-toothed harrow.\r\n\r\nWorking as he was with one horse alone, this took considerable time,\r\nand when this corn land was ready, it was time for him to go through the\r\ngarden piece again with the horse cultivator.\r\n\r\nSister and Lem Camp, both, had learned to use the man-weight wheel-hoe,\r\nand the fine stuff was thinned and the weeds well cut out. From time\r\nto time the young farmer had planted peas--both the dwarf and taller\r\nvarieties--and now he risked putting in some early beans--“snap” and\r\nbush limas--and his first planting of sweet corn.\r\n\r\nOf the latter he put in four rows across the garden, each, of sixty-five\r\nday, seventy-five day, and ninety day sugar corn--all of well-known\r\nkinds. He planned later to put in, every fortnight, four rows of a\r\nmid-length season corn, so as to have green corn for sale, and for the\r\nhouse, up to frost.\r\n\r\nThe potatoes were growing finely and he hilled them up for the first\r\ntime. He marked his four-acre lot for field corn--cross-checking it\r\nthree-feet, ten inches apart. This made twenty-seven hundred and fifty\r\nhills to the acre, and with the hand-planter--an ingenious but cheap\r\nmachine--he dropped two and three kernels to the hill.\r\n\r\nThis upland, save where he had spread coarse stable manure, was\r\nnot rich. Upon each corn-hill he had Sister throw half a handful of\r\nfertilizer. She followed him as he used the planter, and they planted\r\nand fertilized the entire four acres in less than two days.\r\n\r\nThe lime he had put into the land would release such fertility as\r\nremained dormant there; but Hiram did not expect a big crop of corn on\r\nthat piece. If he made two good ears to the hill he would be satisfied.\r\n\r\nHe had knocked together a rough cold-frame, on the sunny side of the\r\nwoodshed, to fit some old sash he had found in the barn. Into the rich\r\nearth sifted to make the bed in this frame, he transplanted tomato,\r\negg-plant, pepper and other plants of a delicate nature. Early cabbage\r\nand cauliflower had already gone into the garden plot, and in the midst\r\nof an early and saturating rain, all day long, he had transplanted\r\ntable-beets into the rows he had marked out for them.\r\n\r\nThis variety of vegetables were now all growing finely. He sold nearly\r\nsix dollars' worth of radishes in town, and these radishes he showed\r\nMrs. Atterson were really “clear profit.” They had all been pulled from\r\nthe rows of carrots and other small seeds.\r\n\r\nThere were several heavy rains after the tempest which had been so\r\nProvidential; the ground was well saturated, and the river had risen\r\nuntil it roared between its banks in a voice that could be heard, on a\r\nstill day, at the house.\r\n\r\nThe rains started the vegetation growing by leaps and bounds; weeds\r\nalways increase faster than any other growing thing.\r\n\r\nThere was plenty for Hiram to do in the garden, and he kept Sister and\r\nOld Lem Camp busy, too. They were at it from the first faint streak of\r\nlight in the morning until dark.\r\n\r\nBut they were well--and happy. Mother Atterson, her heart troubled by\r\nthought of “that Pepper-man,” could not always repress her smiles. If\r\nthe danger of losing the farm were past, she would have had nothing in\r\nthe world to trouble her.\r\n\r\nThe hundred eggs she had purchased for five dollars had proven more than\r\nsixty per cent fertile. Some advice that Hiram had given her enabled\r\nMrs. Atterson to handle the chickens so that the loss from disease was\r\nvery small.\r\n\r\nHe knocked together for her a couple of pens, eight feet square, which\r\ncould be moved about on the grass every day. In these pens the seventy,\r\nor more, chicks thrived immensely. And Sister was devoted to them.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the old white-faced cow, that had been a terror to Mother\r\nAtterson at the start, had found her calf, and it was a heifer.\r\n\r\n“Take my advice and raise it,” said Hiram. “She is a scrub, but she is a\r\npretty good scrub. You'll see that she will give a good measure of milk.\r\nAnd what this farm needs is cattle.\r\n\r\n“If you could make stable manure enough to cover the cleared acres a\r\nfoot deep, you could raise almost any crop you might name--and\r\nmake money by it. The land is impoverished by the use of commercial\r\nfertilizers, unbalanced by humus.”\r\n\r\n“Well, I guess You know, Hiram,” admitted Mrs. Atterson. “And that\r\ncalf certainly is a pretty creeter. It would be too bad to turn it into\r\nveal.”\r\n\r\nHiram did not intend to raise the calf expensively, however. He took it\r\naway from its mother right at the start, and in two weeks it was eating\r\ngrass, and guzzling skimmed milk and calf-meal, while the old cow was\r\nbeginning to show her employer her value.\r\n\r\nMrs. Atterson bought a small churn and quickly learned that “slight” at\r\nbutter-making which is absolutely essential if one would succeed in the\r\ndairy business.\r\n\r\nThe cow turned out to pasture early in May, too; so her keep was not\r\nso heavy a burden. She lowed some after the calf; but the latter was\r\ngrowing finely under Hiram's care, and Mrs. Atterson had at least two\r\npounds of butter for sale each week, and the housekeeper at the St.\r\nBeris school paid her thirty-five cents a pound for it.\r\n\r\nHiram gradually picked up a retail route in the town, which customers\r\npaid more for the surplus vegetables--and butter--than could be obtained\r\nat the stores. He had taught Sister how to drive, and sometimes even\r\nMrs. Atterson went in with the vegetables.\r\n\r\nThis relieved the young farmer and allowed him to work in the fields.\r\nAnd during these warm, growing May days, he found plenty to do. Just as\r\nthe field corn pushed through the ground he went into the lot with his\r\n14-tooth harrow and broke up the crust and so killed the ever-springing\r\nweeds.\r\n\r\nWith the spikes on the harrow “set back,” no corn-plants were dragged\r\nout of the ground. This first harrowing, too, mixed the fertilizer with\r\nthe soil, and gave the corn the start it so sadly needed.\r\n\r\nBusy as bees, the four transplanted people at the Atterson farmhouse\r\naccomplished a great deal during these first weeks of the warming\r\nseason. And all four of them--Mrs. Atterson, Sister, Old Lem, and Hiram\r\nhimself--enjoyed the work to the full.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII. TOMATOES AND TROUBLE\r\n\r\nHiram Strong had decided that the market prospects of Scoville\r\nprophesied a good price for early tomatoes. He advised, therefore, a\r\ngood sized patch of this vegetable.\r\n\r\nHe had planted in the window boxes seed of several different varieties.\r\nHe had transplanted to the coldframe strong plants numbering nearly five\r\nhundred. He believed that, under garden cultivation, a tomato plant that\r\nwould not yield fifty cents worth of fruit was not worth bothering\r\nwith, while a dollar from a single plant was not beyond the bounds of\r\nprobability.\r\n\r\nIt was safe, Hiram very well knew, to set out tomato plants in this\r\nlocality much before the middle of May; yet he was willing to take some\r\nrisks, and go to some trouble, for the sake of getting early ripened\r\ntomatoes into the Scoville market.\r\n\r\nAs Henry Pollock had prophesied, Hiram did not see much of his friend\r\nduring corn-planting time. The Pollocks put nearly fifty acres in corn,\r\nand the whole family helped in the work, including Mrs. Pollock herself,\r\nand down to the child next to the baby. This little toddler amused his\r\nyounger brother, and brought water to the field for the workers.\r\n\r\nOther families in the neighborhood did the same, Hiram noticed. They all\r\nstrained every effort to put in corn, cultivating as big a crop as they\r\npossibly could handle.\r\n\r\nThis was why locally grown vegetables were scarce in Scoville. And the\r\nyoung farmer proposed to take advantage of this condition of affairs to\r\nthe best of his ability.\r\n\r\nIf they were only to remain here on the farm long enough to handle this\r\none crop, Hiram determined to make that crop pay his employer as well as\r\npossible, although he, himself, had no share in such profit.\r\n\r\nHenry Pollock, however, came along while Hiram was making ready his plat\r\nin the garden for tomatoes. The young farmer was setting several rows of\r\ntwo-inch thick stakes across the garden, sixteen feet apart in the row,\r\nthe rows four feet apart. The stakes themselves were about four feet out\r\nof the ground.\r\n\r\n“What ye doin' there, Hiram?” asked Henry, curiously. “Building a\r\nfence?”\r\n\r\n“Not exactly.”\r\n\r\n“Ain't goin' to have a chicken run out here in the garden, be ye?”\r\n\r\n“I should hope not! The chickens on this place will never mix with the\r\ngarden trucks, if I have any say about it,” declared Hiram, laughing.\r\n\r\n“By Jo!” exclaimed Henry. “Dad says Maw's dratted hens eat up a couple\r\nhundred dollars' worth of corn and clover every year for him-runnin'\r\nloose as they do.”\r\n\r\n“Why doesn't he build your mother proper runs, then, plant green stuff\r\nin several yards, and change the flock over, from yard to yard?” “Oh,\r\nhens won't do well shut up; Maw says so,” said Henry, repeating the\r\nlazy farmer's unfounded declaration-probably originated ages ago, when\r\npoultry was first domesticated.\r\n\r\n“I'll show you, next year, if we are around here,” said Hiram, “whether\r\npoultry will do well enclosed in yards.”\r\n\r\n“I told mother you didn't let your chickens run free, and had no hens\r\nwith them,” said Henry, thoughtfully.\r\n\r\n“No. I do not believe in letting anything on a farm get into lazy\r\nhabits. A hen is primarily intended to lay eggs. I send them back to\r\nwork when they have hatched out their brood.\r\n\r\n“Those home-made brooders of ours keep the chicks quite as warm, and\r\nnever peck the little fellows, or step upon them, as the old hen often\r\ndoes.”\r\n\r\n“That's right, I allow,” admitted Henry, grinning broadly.\r\n\r\n“And some hens will traipse chicks through the grass and weeds as far\r\nas turkeys. No, sir! Send the hens back to business, and let the chicks\r\nshift for themselves. They'll do better.”\r\n\r\n“Them there in the pens certainly do look healthy,” said his friend.\r\n“But you ain't said what you was doin' here, Hiram, setting these\r\nstakes?”\r\n\r\n“Why, I'll tell you,” returned Hiram. “This is my tomato patch.”\r\n\r\n“By Jo!” ejaculated Henry. “You don't want to set tomatoes so fur apart,\r\ndo you?”\r\n\r\n“No, no,” laughed Hiram. “The posts are to string wires on. The tomatoes\r\nwill be two feet apart in the row. As they grow I tie them to the wires,\r\nand so keep the fruit off the ground.\r\n\r\n“The tomato ripens better and more evenly, and the fruit will come\r\nearlier, especially if I pinch back the ends of the vine from time to\r\ntime, and remove some of the side branches.”\r\n\r\n“We don't do all that to raise a tomato crop. And we'll put in five\r\nacres for the cannery this year, as usual,” said Henry, with some scorn.\r\n\r\n“We run the rows out four feet apart, like you do, throwing up a list,\r\nin fact. Then father goes ahead with a stick, making a hole for the\r\nplant every three feet, so't they'll be check-rowed and we can cultivate\r\nthem both ways--and we all set the plants.\r\n\r\n“We never hand-hoe 'em--it don't pay. The cannery isn't giving but\r\nfifteen cents a basket this year--and it's got to be a full five-eighths\r\nbasket, too, for they weigh 'em.”\r\n\r\nHiram looked at him with a quizzical smile.\r\n\r\n“So you set about thirty-six hundred and forty plants to the acre?” he\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\n“I reckon so.”\r\n\r\n“And you'll have five acres of tomatoes?”\r\n\r\n“Yep. So Dad says. He has contracted for that many. But our plants\r\ndon't begin to be big enough to set out yet. We have to keep 'em covered\r\nnights.”\r\n\r\n“And I expect to have about five hundred plants in this patch,” said\r\nHiram, smiling. “I tell you what, Henry.”\r\n\r\n“Huh?” said the other boy. “I bet I take in from my patch--net income, I\r\nmean--this year as much as your father gets at the cannery for his whole\r\ncrop.”\r\n\r\n“Nonsense!” cried Henry. “Maybe Dad'll make a hundred, or a hundred and\r\ntwenty-five dollars. Sometimes tomatoes run as high as thirty dollars an\r\nacre around here.”\r\n\r\n“Wait and see,” said Hiram, laughing. “It is going to cost me more to\r\nraise my crop, and market it, that's true. But if your father doesn't do\r\nbetter with his five acres than you say, I'll beat him.”\r\n\r\n“You can't do it, Hiram,” cried Henry. “I can try, anyway,” said Hiram,\r\nmore quietly, but with confidence. “We'll see.”\r\n\r\n“And say,” Henry added, suddenly, “I was going to tell you something.\r\nYou won't raise these tomatoes--nor no other crop--if Pete Dickerson can\r\nstop ye.”\r\n\r\n“What's the matter with Pete now?” asked Hiram, troubled by thought of\r\nthe secret enemy who had already struck at him in the dark.\r\n\r\n“He was blowing about what he'd do to you down at the crossroads last\r\nevening,” said Henry. “He and his father both hate you like poison, I\r\nexpect.\r\n\r\n“And the fellers down to Cale Schell's are always stirrin' up trouble.\r\nThey think it is sport. Why, Pete got so mad last night he could ha'\r\nchewed tacks!”\r\n\r\n“I have said nothing about Pete to anybody,” said Hiram, firmly.\r\n\r\n“That don't matter. They say you have. They tell Pete a whole lot of\r\nstuff just to see him git riled.\r\n\r\n“And last night he slopped over. He said if you reported around that he\r\nput fire to Mis' Atterson's woods, he'd put it to the house and barns!\r\nOh, he was wild.”\r\n\r\nHiram's face flushed, and then paled.\r\n\r\n“Did Pete try to bum the woods, Hiram?” queried Henry, shrewdly.\r\n\r\n“I never even said I thought so to you, have I?” asked the young farmer,\r\nsternly.\r\n\r\n“Nope. I only heard that fire got into the woods by accident, when I\r\nwas in town. Somebody was hunting through there for coon, and saw the\r\nburned-over place. That's all the fellers at Cale's place knew, too, I\r\nreckon; but they jest put it up to Pete to mad him.”\r\n\r\n“And they succeeded, did they?” said Hiram, sternly.\r\n\r\n“I reckon.”\r\n\r\n“Loose-mouthed people make more trouble in a community than downright\r\nmean ones,” declared Hiram. “If I have any serious trouble with the\r\nDickersons, like enough it will be because of the interference of the\r\nother neighbors.”\r\n\r\n“But,” said Henry, preparing to go on, “Pete wouldn't dare fire your\r\nstable now--after sayin' he'd do it. He ain't quite so big a fool as all\r\nthat.”\r\n\r\nBut Hiram was not so sure. He had this additional trouble on his mind\r\nfrom this very hour, though he never said a word to Mrs. Atterson about\r\nit.\r\n\r\nBut every night before he went to bed be made around of the outbuildings\r\nto make sure that everything was right before he slept.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV. “CORN THAT'S CORN”\r\n\r\nHiram caught sight of Pepper in town one day and went after him. He knew\r\nthe real estate man had returned from his business trip, and the fact\r\nthat the matter of the option was hanging fire, and troubling Mrs.\r\nAtterson exceedingly, urged Hiram go counter to Mr. Strickland's advice.\r\n\r\nThe lawyer had said: “Let sleeping dogs lie.” Pepper had made no move,\r\nhowever, and the uncertainty was very trying both for the young farmer\r\nand his employer.\r\n\r\n“How about that option you talked about, Mr. Pepper?” asked the “youth.\r\nAre you going to exercise it?”\r\n\r\n“I've got time enough, ain't I?” returned the real estate man, eyeing\r\nHiram in his very slyest way.\r\n\r\n“I expect you have--if it really runs a year.”\r\n\r\n“You seen it, didn't you?” demanded Pepper.\r\n\r\n“But we'd like Mr. Strickland to see it.”\r\n\r\n“He's goin' to act for Mrs. Atterson?” queried the man, with a scowl.\r\n\r\n“Oh, yes.”\r\n\r\n“Well, he'll see it-when I'm ready to take it up. Don't you fret,”\r\n retorted Pepper, and turned away.\r\n\r\nThis did not encourage the young farmer, nor was there anything in the\r\nman's manner to yield hope to Mrs. Atterson that she could feel secure\r\nin her title to the farm. So Hiram said nothing to her about meeting the\r\nman.\r\n\r\nBut the youth was very much puzzled. It really did seem as though Pepper\r\nwas afraid to show that paper to Mr. Strickland.\r\n\r\n“There's something queer about it, I believe,” declared the youth to\r\nhimself. “Somewhere there is a trick. He's afraid of being tripped up on\r\nit. But, why does he wait, if he knows the railroad is going to demand a\r\nstrip of the farm and he can get a good price for it?\r\n\r\n“Perhaps he is waiting to make sure that the railroad will condemn a\r\npiece of Mrs. Atterson's farm. If the board should change the route\r\nagain, Pepper would have a farm on his hands that he might not be able\r\nto sell immediately at a profit.\r\n\r\n“For we must confess, that sixteen hundred dollars, as farms have sold\r\nin the past around here, is a good price for the Atterson place. That's\r\nwhy Uncle Jeptha was willing to give an option for a month--if that was,\r\nin the beginning, the understanding the old man had of his agreement\r\nwith Pepper.\r\n\r\n“However, we might as well go ahead with the work, and take what comes\r\nto us in the end. I know no other way to do,” quoth Hiram, with a sigh.\r\n\r\nFor he could not be very cheerful with the prospect of making only a\r\nsingle crop on the place. His profit was to have come out of the second\r\nyear's crop--and, he felt, out of that bottom land which had so charmed\r\nhim on the day he and Henry Pollock had gone over the Atterson Place.\r\n\r\nRiches lay buried in that six acres of bottom. Hiram had read up on\r\nonion culture, and he believed that, if he planted his seed in hot beds,\r\nand transplanted the young onions to the rich soil in this bottom, he\r\ncould raise fully as large onions as they did in either Texas or the\r\nBermudas.\r\n\r\n“Of course, they have the advantage of a longer season down there,”\r\n thought Hiram, “and cheap labor. But maybe I can get cheap labor right\r\naround here. The children of these farmers are used to working in the\r\nfields. I ought to be able to get help pretty cheap.\r\n\r\n“And when it comes to the market--why, I've got the Texas growers, at\r\nleast, skinned a little! I can reach either the Philadelphia or New York\r\nmarket in a day. Yes; given the right conditions, onions ought to pay\r\nbig down there on that lowland.”\r\n\r\nBut this was not the only crop possibility be turned over in his mind.\r\nThere were other vegetables that would grow luxuriantly on that bottom\r\nland--providing, always, the flood did not come and fulfill Henry\r\nPollock's prophecy.\r\n\r\n“Two feet of water on that meadow, eh?” thought Hiram. “Well, that\r\ncertainly would be bad. I wouldn't want that to happen after the ground\r\nwas plowed this year, even. It would tear up the land, and sour it, and\r\nspoil it for a corn-crop, indeed.”\r\n\r\nSo he was down a good deal to the river's edge, watching the ebb and\r\nflow of the stream. A heavy rain would, over night, fill the river to\r\nits very brim and the open field, even beyond the marshy spot, would be\r\na-slop with standing water.\r\n\r\n“It sure wouldn't grow alfalfa,” chuckled Hiram to himself one day. “For\r\nthe water rises here a good deal closer to the surface than four feet,\r\nand alfalfa farmers declare that if the springs rise that high, there is\r\nno use in putting in alfalfa. Why! I reckon just now the water is within\r\nfour inches of the top of the ground.”\r\n\r\nIf the river remained so high, and the low ground so saturated with\r\nwater, he knew, too, that he could not get the six acres plowed in time\r\nto put in corn this year. And it was this year's crop he must think\r\nabout first.\r\n\r\nEven if Pepper did not exercise his option, and turn Mrs. Atterson\r\nout of the place, a big commercial crop of onions, or any other\r\nbetter-paying crop, could only be tried the second year.\r\n\r\nHiram had got his seed corn for the upland piece of the man who raised\r\nthe best corn in the community. He had tried the fertility of each ear,\r\ndiscarded those which proved weakly, or infertile, and his stand of corn\r\nfor the four acres, which was now half hand high, was the best of any\r\nfarmer between the Atterson place and town.\r\n\r\nBut this corn was a hundred-and-ten-day variety. The farmer he got it of\r\ntold him that he had raised a crop from a piece planted the day before\r\nthe Fourth of July; but it was safer to get it in at least by June\r\nfifteenth.\r\n\r\nAnd here it was past June first, and the meadow land had not yet been\r\nplowed.\r\n\r\n“However,” Hiram said to Henry, when they walked down to the riverside\r\non Sunday afternoon, “I'm going ahead on Faith--just as the minister\r\nsaid in church this morning. If Faith can move mountains, we'll give it\r\na chance to move something right down here.”\r\n\r\n“I dunno, Hiram,” returned the other boy, shaking his head. “Father says\r\nhe'll git in here for you with three head and a Number 3 plow by the\r\nmiddle of this week if you say so--'nless it rains again, of course. But\r\nhe's afeared you're goin' to waste Mrs. Atterson's money for her.”\r\n\r\n“Nothing ventured, nothing gained,” quoted Hiram, grimly. “If a farmer\r\ndidn't take chances every year, the whole world would starve to death!”\r\n\r\n“Well,” returned Henry, smiling too, “let the other fellow take the\r\nchances--that's dad's motter.”\r\n\r\n“Yes. And the 'chancey' fellow skims the cream of things every time.\r\nNo, sir!” declared the young fellow, “I'm going to be among the\r\ncream-skimmers, or I won't be a farmer at all.”\r\n\r\nSo the plow was put into the bottom-land Wednesday--and put in deep. By\r\nFriday night the whole piece was plowed and partly harrowed.\r\n\r\nHiram had drawn lime for this bottom-land, proposing to use beside only\r\na small amount of fertilizer. He spread this lime from his one-horse\r\nwagon, while Henry drag-harrowed behind him, and by Saturday noon the\r\njob was done.\r\n\r\nThe horses had not mired at all, much to Mr. Pollock's surprise. And the\r\nplow had bit deep. All the heavy sod of the piece was covered well, and\r\nthe seed bed was fairly level--for corn.\r\n\r\nAlthough the Pollocks did not work on Saturday afternoon, Hiram did\r\nnot feel as though he could stop at this time. Most of the farmers had\r\nalready planted their last piece of corn. Monday would be the fifteenth\r\nof the month.\r\n\r\nSo the young farmer got his home-made corn-row marker down to the\r\nriver-bottom and began marking the piece that afternoon.\r\n\r\nThis marker ran out three rows at each trip across the field, and with\r\na white stake at either end, the youth managed to run his rows very\r\nstraight. He had a good eye.\r\n\r\nIn this case he did not check-row his field. The land was\r\nrich--phenomenally rich, he believed. If he was going to have a crop of\r\ncorn here, he wanted a crop worth while.\r\n\r\nOn the uplands the farmers were satisfied with from thirty to fifty\r\nbaskets of ear-corn to the acre. If this lowland was what he believed it\r\nwas, Hiram was sure it would make twice that.\r\n\r\nAnd at that his corn crop here would only average twenty-five dollars to\r\nthe acre--not a phenomenal profit for Mrs. Atterson in that.\r\n\r\nBut the land would be getting into shape for a better crop, and although\r\ncorn is a crop that will soon impoverish ground, if planted year after\r\nyear on the same piece, Hiram knew that the humus in this soil on the\r\nlowland was almost inexhaustible.\r\n\r\nSo he marked his rows the long way of the field--running with the river.\r\n\r\nOne of the implements left by Uncle Jeptha had been a one-horse\r\ncorn-planter with a fertilizer attachment. Hiram used this, dropping\r\ntwo or three grains twenty-four inches apart, and setting the fertilizer\r\nattachment to one hundred and fifty pounds to the acre.\r\n\r\nHe was until the next Wednesday night planting the piece. Meanwhile it\r\nhad not rained, and the river continued to recede. It was now almost\r\nas low as it had been the day Lettie Bronson's boating party had been\r\n“wrecked” under the big sycamore.\r\n\r\nHiram had not seen the Bronsons for some weeks, but about the time he\r\ngot his late corn planted, Mr. Bronson drove into the Atterson yard, and\r\nfound Hiram cultivating his first corn with the five-tooth cultivator.\r\n\r\n“Well, well, Hiram!” exclaimed the Westerner, looking with a broad smile\r\nover the field. “That's as pretty a field of corn as I ever saw. I don't\r\nbelieve there is a hill missing.”\r\n\r\n“Only a few on the far edge, where the moles have been at work.”\r\n\r\n“Moles don't eat corn, Hiram.”\r\n\r\n“So they say,” returned the young farmer, quietly. “I never could make\r\nup my mind about it.\r\n\r\n“I'm sure, however, that if they are only after slugs and worms which\r\nare drawn to the corn hills by the commercial fertilizer, the moles do\r\nfully as much damage as the slugs would.\r\n\r\n“You see, they make a cavity under the corn hill, and the roots of the\r\nplant wither. Excuse me, but I'd rather have Mr. Mole in somebody else's\r\ngarden.”\r\n\r\nMr. Bronson laughed. “Well, what the little gray fellows eat won't kill\r\nus. But they do spoil otherwise handsome rows. How did you get such a\r\ngood stand of corn, Hiram?”\r\n\r\n“I tested the seed in a seed box early in the spring. I wouldn't plant\r\ncorn any other way. Aside from the hills the moles have spoiled, and a\r\nfew an old crow pulled up, I've got no re-planting to do.\r\n\r\n“And replanted hills are always behind the crop, and seldom make\r\nanything but fodder. If it wasn't for the look of the field, I'd never\r\nre-plant a hill of corn.\r\n\r\n“Of course, I've got to thin this--two grains in the hill is enough on\r\nthis land.”\r\n\r\nMr. Bronson looked at him with growing surprise.\r\n\r\n“Why, my boy, you talk just as though you had tilled the ground for a\r\nscore of years. Who taught you so much about farming?”\r\n\r\n“One of the best farmers who ever lived,” said Hiram, with a smile. “My\r\nfather. And he taught me to go to the correct sources for information,\r\ntoo.”\r\n\r\n“I believe you!” exclaimed Mr. Bronson. “And you're going to have 'corn\r\nthat's corn', as we say in my part of the country, on this piece of\r\nland.”\r\n\r\n“Wait!” said Hiram, smiling and shaking his head.\r\n\r\n“Wait for what?”\r\n\r\n“Wait till you see the corn on my bottom-land--if the river down there\r\ndoesn't drown it out. If we don't have too much rain, I'm going to have\r\ncorn on that river-bottom that will beat anything in this county, Mr.\r\nBronson.”\r\n\r\nAnd the young farmer spoke with assurance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV. THE BARBECUE\r\n\r\nOn the seventeenth day of June Hiram had “grappled out” a mess of\r\npotatoes for their dinner. They were larger than hen's eggs and came\r\nupon the table mealy and white.\r\n\r\nPotatoes were selling at retail in Scoville for two dollars the bushel.\r\nBefore the end of that week--after the lowland corn was planted--Hiram\r\ndug two rows of potatoes, sorted them, and carted them to town, together\r\nwith some bunched beets, a few bunches of young carrots, radishes and\r\nsalad.\r\n\r\nThe potatoes he sold for fifty cents the five-eighth basket, from house\r\nto house, and he brought back, for his load of vegetables, ten dollars\r\nand twenty cents, which he handed to Mrs. Atterson, much to that lady's\r\njoy.\r\n\r\n“My soul and body, Hiram!” she exclaimed. “This is just a God-send--no\r\nless. Do you know that we've sold nigh twenty-five dollars' worth of\r\nstuff already this spring, besides that pair of pigs I let Pollock have,\r\nand the butter to St. Beris?”\r\n\r\n“And it's only a beginning,” Hiram told her. “Wait til' the peas come\r\nalong--we'll have a mess for the table in a few days now. And the sweet\r\ncorn and tomatoes.\r\n\r\n“If you and Sister can do the selling, it will help out a whole lot, of\r\ncourse. I wish we had another horse.”\r\n\r\n“Or an automobile,” said Sister, clapping her hands. “Wouldn't it be\r\nfine to run into town in an auto, with a lot of vegetables? Then Hiram\r\ncould keep right at work with the horse and not have to stop to harness\r\nup for us.”\r\n\r\n“Shucks, child!” admonished Mrs. Atterson. “What big idees you do get in\r\nthat noddle o' yourn.”\r\n\r\nThe girls' boarding school and the two hotels proved good customers for\r\nHiram's early vegetables; for nobody around Scoville had potatoes\r\nat this time, and Hiram's early peas were two weeks ahead of other\r\npeople's.\r\n\r\nHaving got a certain number of towns folks to expect him at least thrice\r\na week, when other farmers had green stuff for sale they could not\r\neasily “cut out” Hiram later in the season.\r\n\r\nAnd not always did the young farmer have to leave his work at home to\r\ndeliver the vegetables and Mrs. Atterson's butter. Sister, or the old\r\nlady herself, could go to town if the load was not too heavy.\r\n\r\nOf course, it cost considerable to live. And hogfood and grain for the\r\nhorse and cow had to be bought. Hiram was fattening four of the spring\r\nshoats against winter. Two they could sell and two kill for their own\r\nuse.\r\n\r\n“Goin' to be big doin's on the Fourth this year, Hiram,” said Henry\r\nPollock, meeting the young farmer on the road from town one day. “Heard\r\nabout it?”\r\n\r\n“In Scoville, do you mean? They're going to have a 'Safe and Sane'\r\nFourth, the Banner says.”\r\n\r\n“Nope. We don't think much of goin' to town Fourth of July. And this\r\nyear there's goin' to be a big picnic in Langdon's Grove--that's up the\r\nriver, you know.”\r\n\r\n“A public picnic?”\r\n\r\n“Sure. A barbecue, we call it,” said Henry. “We have one at the Grove\r\nev'ry year. This time the two Sunday Schools is goin' to join and have a\r\nbig time. You and Sister don't want to miss it. That Mr. Bronson's goin'\r\nto give a whole side o' beef, they tell me, to roast over the fires.”\r\n\r\n“A big banquet is in prospect, is it?” asked Hiram, smiling.\r\n\r\n“And a stew! Gee! you never eat one o' these barbecue stews, did ye?\r\nSome of us will go huntin' the day before, and there'll be birds, and\r\nsquirrels, as well as chickens in that stew--and lima beans, and corn,\r\nand everything good you can think of!” and Henry smacked his lips in\r\nprospect.\r\n\r\nThen he added, bethinking himself of his errand:\r\n\r\n“Everybody chips in and gives the things to eat. What'll you give,\r\nHiram?”\r\n\r\n“Some vegetables,” said Hiram, quickly. “Mrs. Atterson won't object, I\r\nguess. Do they want tomatoes for their stew?”\r\n\r\n“Won't be no tomatoes ripe, Hiram,” said Henry, decidedly.\r\n\r\n“There won't, eh? You come out and take a look at mine,” said Hiram,\r\nlaughing.\r\n\r\nOf all the rows of vegetables in Hiram's garden plot, the thriftiest\r\nand handsomest were the trellised tomato plants. It took nearly half of\r\nSister's time to keep the plants tied up and pinched back, as Hiram had\r\ntaught her.\r\n\r\nBut the stalks were already heavily laden with fruit; and those hanging\r\nlowest on the sturdy vines were already blushing.\r\n\r\n“By Jo!” gasped Henry. “You've done it, ain't you? But the cannery won't\r\ntake 'em yet awhile--and they'll all be gone before September.”\r\n\r\n“The cannery won't get many of my tomatoes,” laughed Hiram. “And these\r\nvines properly trained and cultivated as they are, will bear fruit up to\r\nfrost. You wait and see.”\r\n\r\n“I'll have to tell dad to come and look at these. I dunno, Hiram, if you\r\ncan sell 'em at retail, but you'll git as much for 'em as dad does for\r\nhis whole crop--just as you said.”\r\n\r\n“That's what I'm aiming for,” responded Hiram. “But would the ladies who\r\ncook the barbecue stew care for tomatoes, do you think?”\r\n\r\n“We never git tomatoes this early,” said Henry. “How about potatoes? And\r\nthere ain't many folks dug any of theirn yet, but you.”\r\n\r\nSo, after speaking with Mrs. Atterson, Hiram agreed to supply a barrel\r\nof potatoes for the barbecue, and the day before the Fourth, one of the\r\nfarmers came with a wagon to pick up the supplies.\r\n\r\nEverybody at the Atterson farm would go to the grove--that was\r\nunderstood.\r\n\r\n“If one knocks off work, the others can,” declared Mother Atterson. “You\r\nsee that things is left all right for the critters, Hiram, and we'll\r\ntend to things indoors so that we can be gone till night.”\r\n\r\n“And do, Hiram, look out for my poults the last thing,” cried Sister.\r\n\r\nMrs. Larriper had given Sister a setting of ten turkey eggs and every\r\none of them had hatched under one of Mrs. Atterson's motherly old hens.\r\nAt first the girl had kept the young turkeys and their foster mother\r\nright near the house, so that she could watch them carefully.\r\n\r\nBut poults are rangy, and these being particularly strong and thrifty,\r\nthey soon ran the old hen pretty nearly to death.\r\n\r\nSo Hiram had built a coop into which they could go at night, safe from\r\nany vermin, and set it far down in the east lot, near the woods. Sister\r\nusually went down with a little grain twice a day to call them up, and\r\nkeep them tame.\r\n\r\n“But when they get big enough to roost in the fall, I expect we'll have\r\nto gather that crop with a gun,” Hiram told her, laughing.\r\n\r\nMany of the farmers teams were strung out along the road long before\r\nHiram was ready to set out. He had made sure that the spring wagon was\r\nin good shape, and he had built an extra seat for it, so that the four\r\nrode very comfortably.\r\n\r\nLike every other Fourth of July, the sun was broiling hot! And the dust\r\nrose in clouds as the faster teams passed their slow old nag.\r\n\r\nMrs. Atterson sat up very primly in her best silk, holding a parasol and\r\nwearing a pair of lace mits that had appeared on state occasions for the\r\npast twenty years, at least.\r\n\r\nSister was growing like a weed, and it was hard to keep her skirts and\r\nsleeves at a proper length. But she was an entirely different looking\r\ngirl from the boarding house slavey whom Hiram remembered so keenly back\r\nin Crawberry.\r\n\r\nAs for Old Lem Camp, he was as cheerful as Hiram had ever seen him, and\r\nshowed a deal of interest in everything about the farm, and had proved\r\nhimself, as Mrs. Atterson had prophesied, a great help.\r\n\r\nScarcely a house along the road was not shut up and the dooryard\r\ndeserted--for everybody was going to the barbecue. All but the Dickerson\r\nfamily. Sam was at work in the fields, and the haggard Mrs. Dickerson\r\nlooked dumbly from her porch, with a crying baby in her scrawny arms as\r\nthe Attersons and Hiram passed.\r\n\r\nBut Pete was at the barbecue. He was there when Hiram arrived, and he\r\nwas making himself quite as prominent as anybody.\r\n\r\nIndeed, he made himself so obnoxious finally, that one of the rough men\r\nwho was keeping up the fires threatened to chuck Pete into the biggest\r\none, and then cool him off in the river.\r\n\r\nOtherwise, however, the barbecue passed off very pleasantly. The men who\r\ngoverned it saw that no liquor was brought along, and the unruly element\r\nto which Pete belonged was kept under with an iron hand.\r\n\r\nThere was so little “fun”, of a kind, in Pete's estimation that, after\r\nthe big event of the day--the banquet--he and some of his friends\r\ndisappeared. And the picnicking ground was a much quieter and pleasanter\r\nplace after their departure.\r\n\r\nThe newcomers into the community made many friends and acquaintances\r\nthat day. Sister was going to school in the fall, and she found many\r\ngirls of her age whom she would meet there.\r\n\r\nMrs. Atterson met the older ladies, and was invited to join no less than\r\ntwo “Ladies' Aids”, and, as she said, “if she called on all the\r\nfolks she'd agreed to visit, she'd be goin' ev'ry day from then till\r\nChristmas!”\r\n\r\nAs for Hiram, the men and older boys were rather inclined to jolly him\r\na bit. Not many of them had been upon the Atterson place to see what\r\nhe had done, but they had heard some stories of his proposed crops that\r\namused them.\r\n\r\nWhen Mr. Bronson, however, whom the local men knew to be a big farmer in\r\nthe Middle West, and who owned many farms out there now, spoke favorably\r\nof Hiram's work, the local men listened respectfully.\r\n\r\n“The boy's got it in him to do something,” the Westerner said, in his\r\nhearty fashion. “You're eating his potatoes now, I understand. Which one\r\nof you can dig early potatoes like those?\r\n\r\n“And he's got the best stand of corn in the county.”\r\n\r\n“On that river-bottom, you mean?” asked one.\r\n\r\n“And on the upland, too. You fellows want to look about you a little.\r\nMost of you don't see beyond the end of your noses. You watch out,\r\nor Hiram Strong is going to beat every last one of you this year--and\r\nthat's a run-down farm he's got, at that.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI. SISTER'S TURKEYS\r\n\r\nBut Lettie was not at the barbecue, and to tell the truth, Hiram Strong\r\nwas disappointed.\r\n\r\nDespite the fact that she had seemed inclined to snub him, the young\r\nfarmer was vastly taken with the pretty girl. He had seen nobody about\r\nScoville as attractive as Lettie--nor anywhere else, for that matter!\r\n\r\nHe was too proud to call at the Bronson place, although Mr. Bronson\r\ninvited him whenever he saw Hiram. And at first, Lettie had asked him to\r\ncome, too.\r\n\r\nBut the Western girl did not like being thwarted in any matter--even the\r\nsmallest. And when Hiram would not come to take Pete Dickerson's place,\r\nthe very much indulged girl had showed the young farmer that she was\r\noffended.\r\n\r\nHowever, the afternoon at Langdon's Grove passed very pleasantly, and\r\nHiram and his party did not arrive at the farm again until dusk had\r\nfallen.\r\n\r\n“I'll go down and shut your turkeys up for the night, Sister,” Hiram\r\nsaid, after he had done the other chores for he knew the girl would be\r\nafraid to go so far from the house by lantern-light.\r\n\r\nAnd when he reached the turkey coop, 'way down in the field, Hiram was\r\nvery glad indeed that he had come instead of the girl.\r\n\r\nFor the coop was empty. There wasn't a turkey inside, or thereabout. It\r\nhad been dark an hour and more, then, and the poults should long since\r\nhave been hovered in the coop.\r\n\r\nHad some marauding fox, or other “varmint”, run the young turkeys off\r\ntheir reservation? That seemed improbable at this time of year--and so\r\nearly in the evening. Foxes do not usually go hunting before midnight,\r\nnor do other predatory animals.\r\n\r\nHiram had brought the barn lantern with him, and he took a look around\r\nthe neighborhood of the empty coop.\r\n\r\n“My goodness!” he mused, “Sister will cry her eyes out if anything's\r\nhappened to those little turks. Now, what's this?”\r\n\r\nThe ground was cut up at a little distance from the coop. He examined\r\nthe tracks closely.\r\n\r\nThey were fresh--very fresh indeed. The wheel tracks of a light wagon\r\nshowed, and the prints of a horse's shod hoofs.\r\n\r\nThe wagon had been driven down from the main road, and had turned\r\nsharply here by the coop. Hiram knew, too, that it had stood there for\r\nsome time, for the horse had moved uneasily.\r\n\r\nOf course, that proved the driver had gotten out of the wagon and left\r\nthe horse alone. Doubtless there was but one thief--for it was\r\npositive that the turkeys had been removed by a two-footed--not a\r\nfour-footed--marauder.\r\n\r\n“And who would be mean enough to steal Sister's turkeys? Almost\r\neverybody in the neighborhood has a few to fatten for Thanksgiving and\r\nChristmas. Who--did--this?”\r\n\r\nHe followed the wheel marks of the wagon to the road. He saw the track\r\nwhere it turned into the field, and where it turned out again. And\r\nit showed plainly that the thief came from town, and returned in that\r\ndirection.\r\n\r\nOf course, in the roadway it was impossible to trace the particular\r\ntracks made by the thief's horse and wagon. Too many other vehicles had\r\nbeen over the road within the past hour.\r\n\r\nThe thief must have driven into the field just after night-fall, plucked\r\nthe ten young turkeys, one by one, out of the coop, tying their feet\r\nand flinging them into the bottom of his wagon. Covered with a bag, the\r\nfrightened turkeys would never utter a peep while it remained dark.\r\n\r\n“I hate to tell Sister--I can't tell her,” Hiram said, as he went slowly\r\nback to the house. For Sister had been “counting chickens” again, and\r\nshe had figured that, at eighteen cents per pound, live weight, the ten\r\nturkeys would pay for all the clothes she would need that winter, and\r\ngive her “Christmas money”, too.\r\n\r\nThe young farmer shrank from meeting the girl again that night, and he\r\ndelayed going into the house as long as possible. Then he found they had\r\nall retired, leaving him a cold supper at the end of the kitchen table.\r\n\r\nThe disappearance of the turkeys kept Hiram tossing, wakeful, upon his\r\nbed for some hours. He could not fail to connect this robbery with the\r\nother things that had been done, during the past weeks, to injure those\r\nliving at the Atterson farm.\r\n\r\nWas the secret enemy really Peter Dickerson? And had Pete committed this\r\ncrime now?\r\n\r\nYet the horse and wagon had come from the direction opposite the\r\nDickerson farm, and had returned as it came.\r\n\r\n“I don't know whether I am accusing that fellow wrongfully, or not,”\r\n muttered Hiram, at last. “But I am going to find out. Sister isn't going\r\nto lose her turkeys without my doing everything in my power to get them\r\nback and punish the thief.”\r\n\r\nHe usually arose in the morning before anybody else was astir, so it\r\nwas easy for Hiram to slip out of the house and down to the field to the\r\nempty turkey coop.\r\n\r\nThe marks of horse and wagon were quite as plain in the faint light of\r\ndawn as they had been the night before. In the darkness the thief\r\nhad driven his wagon over some small stumps, amid which his horse had\r\nscrambled in some difficulty, it was plain.\r\n\r\nHiram, tracing out these marks as a Red Indian follows a trail,\r\nsaw something upon the edge of one of the half-decayed stumps that\r\ninterested him greatly.\r\n\r\nHe stood up the next moment with this clue in his hand--a white, coarse\r\nhair, perhaps four inches in length.\r\n\r\n“That was scraped off the horse's fetlock as he scrambled over this\r\nstump,” muttered Hiram. “Now, who drives a white horse, or a horse with\r\nwhite feet, in this neighborhood?\r\n\r\n“Can I narrow the search down in this way, I wonder?” and for some\r\nmoments the youth stood there, in the growing light of early morning,\r\ncanvassing the subject from that angle.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVII. RUN TO EARTH\r\n\r\nA broad streak of crimson along the eastern horizon, over the treetops,\r\nannounced the coming of the sun when Hiram Strong reached the automobile\r\nroad to which he, on the previous night, had traced the thief that had\r\nstolen Sister's poults.\r\n\r\nNow he looked at the track again. It surely had come from the direction\r\nof Scoville, and it turned back that way.\r\n\r\nYet he looked at the white horse-hair scraped off upon the stump, and\r\nhe turned his back upon these signs and strode along the road toward his\r\nown home.\r\n\r\nSmoke was just curling from the Atterson chimney; Sister, or Mrs.\r\nAtterson, was just building the fire. But they did not see Hiram as he\r\nwent by.\r\n\r\nHiram's quest led him past the place and to the Dickerson farm. There\r\nnobody was yet astir, save the mules and horses in the barnyard, who\r\ncalled as he went by, hoping for their breakfast.\r\n\r\nHiram knew that the Dickersons had turkeys and, like most of the other\r\nfarmers, cooped them in distant fields away from the house. He found\r\nthree coops in the middle of an old oat-field tinder a spreading beech.\r\n\r\nThe old turks roosted upon the limbs of the beech at night; they were\r\nalready up and away, hunting grasshoppers for breakfast. But quite a few\r\npoults were running and peeping about the coops, with two hen turkeys\r\nplaying guard to them.\r\n\r\nHiram saw where a wagon had been driven in here, and turned, too. The\r\ntracks were made recently. And one of the coops was shut tight, although\r\nhe knew by the rustling within that there were young turkeys in it.\r\n\r\nIt was too dark within the hutch, however, for the youth to number the\r\npoults confined there.\r\n\r\nHe strolled back across the fields to the rear of the Dickerson house.\r\nPassing the barnyard first, he halted and examined the bright bay horse,\r\nwith white feet--the one that Pete had driven to the barbecue the day\r\nbefore--the only one Pete was ever allowed to drive off the farm.\r\n\r\nThe Dickersons, father and son, were not as early risers as most farmers\r\nin those parts. At least, they were not up betimes on this morning.\r\n\r\nBut Mrs. Dickerson had built the fire now and was stirring about the\r\nporch when Hiram arrived at the step, filling her kettle at the pump.\r\n\r\n“Mornin', Mr. Strong,” she said, in her startled way, eyeing Hiram\r\naskance.\r\n\r\nShe was a lean, sharp-featured woman, with a hopeless droop to her\r\nshoulders.\r\n\r\n“Good-morning, Mrs. Dickerson,” said Hiram, gravely. “How many young\r\nturkeys have you this year?”\r\n\r\nThe woman shrank back and almost dropped the kettle she had filled to\r\nthe pump-bench. Her eyes glared.\r\n\r\nSomewhere in the house a baby squatted; then a door banged and Hiram\r\nheard Dickerson's heavy step descending the stair.\r\n\r\n“You have a coop of poults down there, Mrs. Dickerson,” continued Hiram,\r\nconfidently, “that I know belongs to us. I traced Pete's tracks with the\r\nwagon and the white-footed horse. Now, this is going to make trouble for\r\nPete----”\r\n\r\n“What's the matter with Pete, now?” demanded Dickerson's harsh voice,\r\nand he came out upon the porch.\r\n\r\nHe scowled at sight of Hiram, and continued:\r\n\r\n“What are you roaming around here for, Strong? Can't you keep on your\r\nown side of the fence?”\r\n\r\n“It's little I'll ever trouble you, Mr. Dickerson,” said Hiram,\r\n“sharply, if you and yours don't trouble me, I can assure you.”\r\n\r\n“What's eating you now?” demanded the man, roughly.\r\n\r\n“Why, I'll tell you, Mr. Dickerson,” said Hiram, quickly. “Somebody's\r\nstolen our turkeys--ten of them. And I have found them down there where\r\nyour turkeys roost. The natural inference is that somebody here knows\r\nabout it----”\r\n\r\nDickerson--just out of his bed and as ugly as many people are when they\r\nfirst get up--leaped for the young farmer from the porch, and had him in\r\nhis grip before Hiram could help himself.\r\n\r\nThe woman screamed. There was a racket in the house, for some of the\r\nchildren had been watching from the window.\r\n\r\n“Dad's goin' to lick him!” squalled one of the girls.\r\n\r\n“You come here and intermate that any of my family's thieves, do you?”\r\n the angry man roared.\r\n\r\n“Stop that, Sam Dickerson!” cried his wife. She suddenly gained courage\r\nand ran to the struggling pair, and tried to haul Sam away from Hiram.\r\n\r\n“The boy's right,” she gasped. “I heard Pete tellin' little Sam last\r\nnight what he'd done. It's come to a pretty pass, so it has, if you are\r\ngoin' to uphold that bad boy in thieving----”\r\n\r\n“Hush up, Maw!” cried Pete's voice from the house.\r\n\r\n“Come out here, you scalawag!” ordered his father, relaxing his hold on\r\nHiram.\r\n\r\nPete slouched out on the porch, wearing a grin that was half sheepish,\r\nhalf worried.\r\n\r\n“What's this Strong says about turkeys?” demanded Sam Dickerson,\r\nsternly.\r\n\r\n“'Tain't so!” declared Pete. “I ain't seen no turkeys.”\r\n\r\n“I have found them,” said Hiram, quietly. “And the coopful is down\r\nyonder in your lot. You thought to fool me by turning into our farm from\r\nthe direction of Scoville, and driving back that way; but you turned\r\naround in the road under that overhanging oak, where I picked Lettie\r\nBronson off the back of the runaway horse last Spring.\r\n\r\n“Now, those ten turkeys belong to Sister. She'll be heart-broken if\r\nanything happens to them. You have played me several mean tricks since I\r\nhave been here, Pete Dickerson----”\r\n\r\n“No, I ain't!” interrupted the boy.\r\n\r\n“Who took the burr off the end of my axle and let me down in the road\r\nthat night?” demanded Hiram, his rage rising.\r\n\r\nPete could not forbear a grin at this remembrance.\r\n\r\n“And who tampered with our pump the next morning? And who watched and\r\nwaited till we left the lower meadow that night we burned the rubbish,\r\nand then set fire to our woods----”\r\n\r\nMrs. Dickerson screamed again. “I knew that fire never come by\r\naccident,” she moaned.\r\n\r\n“You shut up, Maw!” admonished her hopeful son again.\r\n\r\n“And now, I've got you,” declared Hiram, with confidence. “I can tell\r\nthose ten poults. I marked them for Sister long ago so that, if they\r\nwent to the neighbors, they could be easily identified.\r\n\r\n“They're in that shut-up coop down yonder,” continued Hiram, “and unless\r\nyou agree to bring them back at once, and put them in our coop, I shall\r\nhitch up and go to town, first thing, and get out a warrant for your\r\narrest.”\r\n\r\nSam had remained silent for a minute, or two. Now he said, decidedly:\r\n\r\n“You needn't threaten no more, young feller. I can see plain enough that\r\nPete's been carrying his fun too far----”\r\n\r\n“Fun!” ejaculated Hiram.\r\n\r\n“That's what I said,” growled Sam. “He'll bring the turkeys back-and\r\nbefore he has his breakfast, too.”\r\n\r\n“All right,” said Hiram, knowing full well that there was nothing to\r\nbe made by quarreling with Sam Dickerson. “His returning the turkeys,\r\nhowever, will not keep me from speaking to the constable the very next\r\ntime Pete plays any of his tricks around our place.\r\n\r\n“It may be 'fun' for him; but it won't look so funny from the inside of\r\nthe town jail.”\r\n\r\nHe walked off after this threat. And he was sorry he had said it. For he\r\nhad no real intention of having Pete arrested, and an empty threat is of\r\nno use to anybody.\r\n\r\nThe turkeys came back; Sister did not even know that they had been\r\nstolen, for when she went down to feed them about the middle of the\r\nforenoon, all ten came running to her call.\r\n\r\nBut Pete Dickerson ceased from troubling for a time, much to Hiram's\r\nsatisfaction.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the crops were coming on finely. Hiram's tomatoes were\r\nbringing good prices in Scoville, and as he had such a quantity and was\r\nso much earlier than the other farmers around about, he did, as he told\r\nHenry he would do, “skim the cream off the market.”\r\n\r\nHe bought some crates and baskets in town, too, and shipped some of\r\nthe tomatoes to a produce man he knew in Crawberry--a man whom he could\r\ntrust to treat him fairly. During the season that man's checks to Mrs.\r\nAtterson amounted to fifty-four dollars.\r\n\r\nThree times a week the spring wagon went to town with vegetables for the\r\nschool, the hotels, and their retail customers. The whole family worked\r\nlong hours, and worked hard; but nobody complained.\r\n\r\nNo rain fell of any consequence until the latter part of July; and then\r\nthere was no danger of the river overflowing and drowning out the corn.\r\n\r\nAnd that corn! By the last of July it was waist high, growing rank and\r\nstrong, and of that black-green color which delights the farmer's eye.\r\n\r\nMr. Bronson walked down to the river especially to see it. Like Hiram's\r\nupland corn, there was scarcely a hill missing, save where the muskrats\r\nhad dug in from the river bank and disturbed the corn hills.\r\n\r\n“That's the finest-looking corn in this county, bar none, Hiram,”\r\n declared Bronson. “I have seldom seen better looking in the rich\r\nbottom-lands of the West. And you certainly do keep it clean, boy.”\r\n\r\n“No use in putting in a crop if you don't 'tend it,” said the young\r\nfarmer, sententiously.\r\n\r\n“And what's this along here?” asked the gentleman, pointing to a row or\r\ntwo of small stuff along the inner edge of the field.\r\n\r\n“I'm trying onions and celery down here. I want to put a commercial crop\r\ninto this field next year--if we are let stay here--that will pay Mrs.\r\nAtterson and me a real profit,” and Hiram laughed.\r\n\r\n“What do you call a real profit?” inquired Mr. Bronson, seriously.\r\n\r\n“Four hundred dollars an acre, net,” said the young farmer, promptly.\r\n\r\n“Why, Hiram, you can't do that!” cried the gentleman.\r\n\r\n“It's being done--in other localities and on soil not so rich as\r\nthis--and I believe I can do it.”\r\n\r\n“With onions or celery?” “Yes, sir.” “Which--or both?” asked the\r\nWesterner, interested.\r\n\r\n“I am trying them out here, as you see. I believe it will be celery.\r\nThis soil is naturally wet, and celery is a glutton for water. Then, it\r\nis a late piece, and celery should be transplanted twice before it is\r\nput in the field, I believe.”\r\n\r\n“A lot of work, boy,” said Mr. Bronson, shaking his head.\r\n\r\n“Well, I never expect to get something for nothing,” remarked Hiram.\r\n\r\n“And how about the onions?”\r\n\r\n“Why, they don't seem to do so well. There is something lacking in the\r\nland to make them do their best. I believe it is too cold. And, then, I\r\nam watching the onion market, and I am afraid that too many people\r\nhave gone into the game in certain sections, and are bound to create an\r\nover-supply.”\r\n\r\nThe gentleman looked at him curiously.\r\n\r\n“You certainly are an able-minded youngster, Hiram,” he observed. “I\r\ns'pose if you do so well here next year as you expect, a charge of\r\ndynamite wouldn't blast you away from the Atterson farm?”\r\n\r\n“Why, Mr. Bronson,” responded the young farmer, “I don't want to run a\r\none-horse farm all my life. And this never can be much more. It isn't\r\nnear enough to any big city to be a real truck farm--and I'm interested\r\nin bigger things.\r\n\r\n“No, sir. The Atterson Eighty is only a stepping stone for me. I hope\r\nI'll go higher before long.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVIII. HARVEST\r\n\r\nBut Hiram was not at all sure that he would ever see a celery crop in\r\nthis bottom-land. Pepper still “hung fire” and he would not go to Mr.\r\nStrickland with his option.\r\n\r\n“I don't hafter,” he told Hiram. “When I git ready I'll let ye know, be\r\nsure o' that.”\r\n\r\nThe fact was that the railroad had made no further move. Mr. Strickland\r\nadmitted to Mrs. Atterson that if the strip along the east boundary\r\nof the farm was condemned by the railroad, she ought to get a thousand\r\ndollars for it.\r\n\r\n“But if the railroad board should change its mind again,” added the\r\nlawyer, “sixteen hundred dollars would not be a speculative price to pay\r\nfor your farm--and well Pepper knows it.”\r\n\r\n“Then Mr. Damocles's sword has got to hang over us, has it?” demanded\r\nthe old lady.\r\n\r\n“I am afraid so,” admitted the lawyer, smiling.\r\n\r\nMrs. Atterson could not be more troubled than was Hiram himself. Youth\r\nfeels the sting of such arrows of fortune more keenly than does age. We\r\nget “case-hardened” to trouble as the years bend our shoulders.\r\n\r\nThe thought that he might, after all, get nothing but a hundred dollars\r\nand his board for all the work he had done in preparation for the second\r\nyear's crop sometimes embittered Hiram's thoughts.\r\n\r\nOnce, when he spoke to Pepper, and the snaky man sneered at him and\r\nlaughed, the young farmer came near attacking him then and there in the\r\nstreet.\r\n\r\n“I certainly could have given that Pepper as good a thrashing as ever he\r\ngot,” muttered Hiram. “And even Pete Dickerson never deserved one more\r\nthan Pepper.”\r\n\r\nPete fought shy of Hiram these days, and as the summer waned the young\r\nfarmer gradually became less watchful and expectant of trouble from the\r\ndirection of the west boundary of the Atterson Eighty.\r\n\r\nBut there was little breathing spell for him in the work of the farm.\r\n\r\n“When we lay by the corn, you bet dad an' me goes fishing!” Henry\r\nPollock told Hiram, one day.\r\n\r\nBut it wasn't often that the young farmer could take half a day off for\r\nany such pleasure.\r\n\r\n“You've bit off more'n you kin chaw,” observed Henry.\r\n\r\n“That's all right; I'll keep chewing at it, just the same,” returned\r\nHiram cheerfully.\r\n\r\nFor the truck crop was bringing them in a bigger sum of money than even\r\nHiram had expected. The season had been very favorable, indeed; Hiram's\r\nvegetables had come along in good time, and even the barrels of sweet\r\ncorn he shipped to Crawberry brought a fair price--much better than he\r\ncould have got at the local cannery.\r\n\r\nWhen the tomato pack came on, however, he did sell many baskets of his\r\n“seconds” to the cannery. But the selected tomatoes he continued to ship\r\nto Crawberry, and having established a reputation with his produce man\r\nfor handsome and evenly ripened fruit, the prices received were good all\r\nthrough the season.\r\n\r\nHe saw the sum for tomatoes pass the hundred and fifty dollar mark\r\nbefore frost struck the vines. Even then he was not satisfied. There was\r\na small cellar under the Atterson house, and when the frosty nights of\r\nOctober came, Hiram dragged up the vines still bearing fruit, by the\r\nroots, and hung them in the cellar, where the tomatoes continued to\r\nripen slowly nearly up to Thanksgiving.\r\n\r\nOther crops did almost as well in proportion. He had put in no late\r\npotatoes; but in September he harvested the balance of his early crop\r\nand, as they were a good keeping variety, he knew there would be enough\r\nto keep the family supplied until the next season.\r\n\r\nOf other roots, including a patch of well-grown mangels for Mrs.\r\nAtterson's handsome flock of chickens, there were plenty to carry the\r\nfamily over the winter.\r\n\r\nAs the frosts became harder Hiram dug his root pits in the high, light\r\nsoil of the garden, drew pinetags to cover them, and, gradually, as the\r\nwinter advanced, heaped the earth over the various piles of roots to\r\nkeep them through the winter.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, in September, corn harvest had come on. The four acres Hiram\r\nhad planted below the stables yielded a fair crop, that part of the\r\nland he had been able to enrich with coarse manure showing a much better\r\naverage than the remainder.\r\n\r\nThe four acres yielded them something over one hundred and sixty baskets\r\nof sound corn which, as corn was then selling for fifty cents per\r\nbushel, meant that the crop was worth about forty dollars.\r\n\r\nAs near as Hiram could figure it had cost about fifteen dollars to raise\r\nthe crop; therefore the profit to Mrs. Atterson was some twenty-five\r\ndollars.\r\n\r\nBesides the profit from some of the garden crops, this was very small\r\nindeed; as Hiram said, it did not pay well enough to plant small patches\r\nof corn for them to fool with it much.\r\n\r\n“The only way to make a good profit out of corn corn a place like this,”\r\n he said to Henry, who would not be convinced, “is to have a big drove of\r\nhogs and turn them into the field to fatten on the standing corn.”\r\n\r\n“But that would be wasteful!” cried Henry, shocked at the suggestion.\r\n\r\n“Big pork producers do not find it so,” returned Hiram, confidently. “Or\r\nelse one wants a drove of cattle to fatten, and cuts the corn green and\r\nshreds it, blowing it into a silo.\r\n\r\n“The idea is to get the cost of the corn crop back through the price\r\npaid by the butcher for your stock, or hogs.”\r\n\r\n“Nobody ever did that around here,” declared young Pollock.\r\n\r\n“And that's why nobody gets ahead very fast around here. Henry, why\r\ndon't you strike out and do something new--just to surprise 'em?\r\n\r\n“Stop selling a little tad of this, and a little tad of that off the\r\nfarm and stick to the good farmer's rule: 'Never sell anything off the\r\nplace that can't walk off.'”\r\n\r\n“I've heard that before,” said Henry, sighing.\r\n\r\n“And even then just so much fertility goes with every yoke of steers\r\nor pair of fat hogs. But it is less loss, in proportion, than when the\r\ncorn, or oats, or wheat itself is sold.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIX. LETTIE BRONSON'S CORN HUSKING\r\n\r\nSister had begun school on the very first day it opened--in September.\r\nShe was delighted, for although she had had “lessons” at the\r\n“institution”, they had not been like this regular attendance, with\r\nother free and happy children, at a good country school.\r\n\r\nSister was growing not alone in body, but in mind. And the improvement\r\nin her appearance was something marvelous.\r\n\r\n“It certainly does astonish me, every time I think o' that youngun\r\nand the way she looked when she come to me from the charity school,”\r\n declared Mother Atterson.\r\n\r\n“Who'd want a better lookin' young'un now? She'd be the pride of any\r\nmother's heart, she'd be.\r\n\r\n“If there's folks belongin' to her, and they have neglected her all\r\nthese years, in my opinion they're lackin' in sense, Hiram.”\r\n\r\n“They certainly have been lacking in the milk of human kindness,”\r\n admitted the young farmer.\r\n\r\n“Huh! That milk's easily soured in many folks,” responded Mrs.\r\nAtterson. “But Sister's folks, whoever they be, will be sorry some day.”\r\n\r\n“You don't suppose she really has any family, do you?” demanded Hiram.\r\n\r\n“No father nor mother, I expect. But many a family will get rid of\r\na young'un too small to be of any use, when they probably have many\r\nchildren of their own.\r\n\r\n“And if there was a little bait of money coming to the child, as that\r\nlawyer told the institution matron, that would be another reason for\r\nlosing her in this great world.”\r\n\r\n“I'm afraid Sister will never find her folks, Mrs. Atterson,” said\r\nHiram, shaking his head.\r\n\r\n“Huh! If she don't, it's no loss to her. It's loss to them,” declared\r\nthe old lady. “And I'd hate to have anybody come and take her away from\r\nus now.”\r\n\r\nSister no longer wore her short hair in four “pigtails”. She had learned\r\nto dress it neatly like other girls of her age, and although it would\r\nnever be like the beautiful blue-black tresses of Lettie Bronson, Hiram\r\nhad to admit that the soft brown of Sister's hair, waving so prettily\r\nover her forehead, made the girl's features more than a little\r\nattractive.\r\n\r\nShe was an entirely different person, too, from the one who had helped\r\nLettie and her friends ashore from the grounded motor-boat that day, so\r\nlong ago--and so Lettie herself thought when she rode into the Atterson\r\nyard one October day on her bay horse, and Sister met her on the porch.\r\n\r\n“Why, you're Mrs. Atterson's girl, aren't you?” cried Lettie, leaning\r\nfrom her saddle to offer her hand to Sister. “I wouldn't have known\r\nyou.”\r\n\r\nSister was getting plump, she had roses in her cheeks, and she wore a\r\nneat, whole, and becoming dress.\r\n\r\n“You're Miss Bronson,” said Sister, gravely. “I wouldn't forget you.”\r\n\r\nPerhaps there was something in what Sister said that stung Lettie\r\nBronson's memory. She flushed a little; but then she smiled most\r\ncharmingly and asked for Hiram.\r\n\r\n“Husking corn, Miss, with Henry Pollock, down on the bottom-land.”\r\n\r\n“Oh! way down there? Well! you tell him--Why, I'll want you to come,\r\ntoo,” laughed Lettie, quite at her best now.\r\n\r\nNobody could fail to answer Lettie Bronson's smile with its reflection,\r\nwhen she chose to exert herself in that direction.\r\n\r\n“Why, I just came to tell you both that on Friday we're going to have an\r\nold-fashioned husking-bee for all the young folks of the neighborhood,\r\nat our place. You must come yourself--er--Sister, and tell Hiram to\r\ncome, too.\r\n\r\n“Seven o'clock, sharp, remember--and I'll be dreadfully disappointed if\r\nyou don't come,” added Lettie, turning her horse's head homeward, and\r\nsaying it with so much cordiality that her hearer's heart warmed.\r\n\r\n“She is pretty,” mused Sister, watching the bay horse and its rider\r\nflying along the road. “I don't blame Hiram for thinking she's the very\r\nfinest girl in these parts.\r\n\r\n“She is,” declared Sister, emphatically, and shook herself.\r\n\r\nHiram had finished husking the lowland corn that day, with Henry's help,\r\nand it was all drawn in at night. When the last measured basket was\r\nheaped in the crib by lantern light, the young farmer added up the\r\nfigures chalked up on the lintel of the door.\r\n\r\n“For goodness' sake, Hiram! it isn't as much as that, is it?” gasped\r\nHenry, viewing the figures the young farmer wrote proudly in his\r\nmemorandum book.\r\n\r\n“Six acres--six hundred and eighty baskets of sound corn,” crowed\r\n“Hiram. And it's corn that is corn, as Mr. Bronson says.\r\n\r\n“It's not quite as hard as the upland corn, for the growing season was\r\nnot quite long enough for it; but it's better than the average in the\r\ncounty----”\r\n\r\n“Three hundred and forty bushel of shelled corn from six acres?” cried\r\nHenry. “I should say it was! It's worth fifty cents now right at the\r\ncrib--a hundred and seventy dollars. Hiram! that'll make dad let me go\r\nto the agricultural college.”\r\n\r\n“What?” cried Hiram, surprised and pleased. “Have you really got that\r\nidea in your head?”\r\n\r\n“I been gnawin' on it ever since you talked so last spring,” admitted\r\nhis friend, rather shyly. “I told father, and at first he pooh-poohed.\r\n\r\n“But I kept on pointing out to him how much more you knowed than we\r\ndid--”\r\n\r\n“That's nonsense, Henry,” interrupted Hiram. “Only about some things. I\r\nwouldn't want to set myself up over the farmers of this neighborhood as\r\nknowing so much.”\r\n\r\n“Well, you've proved it. Dad says so himself. He was taken all aback\r\nwhen I showed him how you had beat him on the tomato crop. And I been\r\ntalking to him about your corn.\r\n\r\n“That hit father where he lived,” chuckled Henry, “for father's a\r\ncorn-growing man--and always has been considered so in this county.\r\n\r\n“He watched the way you tilled your crop, and he believed so much\r\nshallow cultivating was wrong, and said so. But he says you beat him\r\non poor ground; and when I tell him what that lowland figures up, he'll\r\nthrow up his hands.\r\n\r\n“And I'm going to take a course in fertilizers, farm management, and the\r\nchemistry of soils,” continued Henry.\r\n\r\n“Just as you say, I believe we have been planting the wrong crops on the\r\nright land! Anyway, I'll find out. I believe we've got a good farm, but\r\nwe're not getting out of it what we should.”\r\n\r\n“Well, Henry,” admitted Hiram, slowly, “nothing's pleased me so much\r\nsince I came into this neighborhood, as to hear you say this. You get\r\nall you can at the experiment station this winter, and I believe that\r\nyour father will soon begin to believe that there is something in 'book\r\nfarming', after all.”\r\n\r\nIf it had not been for the hair-hung sword over them, Mrs. Atterson and\r\nHiram would have taken great delight in the generous crops that had been\r\nvouchsafed to them.\r\n\r\n“Still, we can't complain,” said the old lady, “and for the first time\r\nfor more'n twenty years I'm going to be really thankful at Thanksgiving\r\ntime.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, I believe you!” cried Sister, who heard her. “No boarders.”\r\n\r\n“Nope,” said the old lady, quietly. “You're wrong. For we're going\r\nto have boarders on Thanksgiving Day. I've writ to Crawberry. Anybody\r\nthat's in the old house now that wants to come to eat dinner with us,\r\ncan come. I'm going to cook the best dinner I ever cooked--and make a\r\nmilkpail full of gravy.”\r\n\r\n“I know,” said the good old soul, shaking her head, “that them two old\r\nmaids I sold out to have half starved them boys. We ought to be able to\r\nstand even Fred Crackit, and Mr. Peebles, one day in the year.”\r\n\r\n“Well!” returned Sister, thoughtfully. “If you can stand 'em I can. I\r\nnever did think I could forgive 'em all--so mean they was to me--and the\r\nhair-pulling and all.\r\n\r\n“But I guess you're right, Mis' Atterson. It's heapin' coals of fire on\r\ntheir heads, like what the minister at the chapel says.”\r\n\r\n“Good Land o' Goshen, child!” exclaimed the old lady, briskly. “Hot\r\ncoals would scotch 'em, and I only want to fill their stomachs for\r\nonce.”\r\n\r\nThe husking at the Bronsons was a very well attended feast, indeed.\r\nThere was a great barn floor, and on this were heaped the ear-corn in\r\nthe husks--not too much, for Lettie proposed having the floor cleared\r\nand swept for square dancing, and later for the supper.\r\n\r\nShe had a lot of her school friends at the husking, and at first the\r\nneighborhood boys and girls were bashful in the company of the city\r\ngirls.\r\n\r\nBut after they got to work husking the corn, and a few red ears had been\r\nfound (for which each girl or boy had to pay a forfeit) they became a\r\nvery hilarious company indeed.\r\n\r\nNow, Lettie, broadly hospitable, had invited the young folk far and\r\nwide. Even those whom she had not personally seen, were expected to\r\nattend.\r\n\r\nSo it was not surprising that Pete Dickerson should come, despite the\r\nfact that Mr. Bronson had once discharged him from his employ--and for\r\nserious cause.\r\n\r\nBut Pete was not a thin-skinned person. Where there was anything “doing”\r\n he wanted to cut a figure. And his desire to be important, and be marked\r\nby the company, began to make him objectionable before the evening was\r\nhalf over.\r\n\r\nFor instance, he thought it was funny to take a run down the long barn\r\nfloor and leap over the heads of those huskers squatting about a heap\r\nof corn, and land with his heavy boots on the apex of the pile, thus\r\nscattering the ears in all directions.\r\n\r\nHe got long straws, too, and tickled the backs, of the girls' necks; or\r\nhe dumped handfuls of bran down their backs, or shook oats into their\r\nhair--and the oats stuck.\r\n\r\nMr. Bronson could not see to everything; and Pete was very sly at his\r\ntricks. A girl would shriek in one corner, and the lout would quickly\r\ntransport himself to a distant spot.\r\n\r\nWhen the corn was swept aside, and the floor cleared for the dance, Pete\r\nwent beyond the limit, however. He had found a pail of soft-soap in the\r\nshed and while the crowd was out of the barn, playing a “round game”\r\n in the yard while it was being swept, Pete slunk in with the soap and a\r\nswab, and managed to spread a good deal of the slippery stuff around on\r\nthe boards.\r\n\r\nA broom would not remove this soft-soap. When the hostler swept, he\r\nonly spread it. And when the dancing began many a couple measured their\r\nlength on the planks, to Pete's great delight.\r\n\r\nBut the hired man had observed Pete sneaking about while he was removing\r\nthe last of the corn, and Hiram Strong discovered soft-soap on Pete's\r\nclothes, and the smell of it strong upon his unwashed hands.\r\n\r\n“You get out of here,” Mr. Bronson told the boy. “I had occasion to put\r\nyou off my land once, and don't let me have to do it a third time,”\r\n and he shoved him with no gentle hand through the door and down the\r\ndriveway.\r\n\r\nBut Pete laid it all to Hiram. He called back over his shoulder:\r\n\r\n\r\n“I'll be square with you, yet, Hi Strong! You wait!”\r\n\r\nBut Hiram bad been threatened so often from that quarter by now, that he\r\nwas not much interested.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXX. ONE SNOWY MIDNIGHT\r\n\r\nThe fun went on after that with more moderation, and everybody had a\r\npleasant time. That is, so supposed Hiram Strong until, in going out of\r\nthe barn again to get a breath of cool air after one of the dances, he\r\nalmost stumbled over a figure hiding in a corner, and crying.\r\n\r\n“Why, Sister!” he cried, taking the girl by the shoulders, and turning\r\nher about. “What's the matter?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, I want to go home, Hi. This isn't any place for me. Let me--me\r\nrun--run home!” she sobbed.\r\n\r\n“I guess not! Who's bothered you? Has that Pete Dickerson come back?”\r\n\r\n“No!” sobbed Sister.\r\n\r\n“What is it, then?”\r\n\r\n“They--they don't want me here. They don't like me.”\r\n\r\n“Who don't?” demanded Hiram, sternly.\r\n\r\n“Those--those girls from St. Beris. I--I tried to dance, and I slipped\r\non some of that horrid soap and--and fell down. And they said I was\r\nclumsy. And one said:\r\n\r\n“'Oh, all these country girls are like that. I don't see what Let wanted\r\nthem here for.'\r\n\r\n“'So't we could all show off better,' said another, laughing some more.\r\n\r\n“And I guess that's right enough,” finished Sister. “They don't want me\r\nhere. Only to make fun of. And I wish I hadn't come.”\r\n\r\nHiram was smitten dumb for a moment. He had danced once with Lettie, but\r\nthe other town girls had given him no opportunity to do so. And it was\r\nplain that Lettie's school friends preferred the few boys who had come\r\nup from town to any of the farmers' sons who had come to the husking.\r\n\r\n“I guess you're right, Sister. They don't want us--much,” admitted\r\nHiram, slowly.\r\n\r\n“Then let's both go home,” said Sister, sadly.\r\n\r\n“No. That wouldn't be serving Mr. Bronson--or Lettie--right. We were\r\ninvited in good faith, I reckon, and the Bronsons haven't done anything\r\nto offend us.\r\n\r\n“But you and I'll go back there and dance together. You dance with\r\nme--or with Henry; and I'll stick to the country girls. If Lettie\r\nBronson's friends from boarding school think they are so much better\r\nthan us folks out here in the country, let us show them that we can have\r\na good time without them.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, I'll go back with you, Hiram,” cried Sister, gladly, and the young\r\nfellow was a bit conscience-stricken as he noted her changed tone and\r\nsaw the sparkle that came into her eye.\r\n\r\nHad he neglected Sister because Lettie Bronson was about? Well! perhaps\r\nhe had. But he made up for it with the attention he paid to Sister\r\nduring the remainder of the evening.\r\n\r\nThey went home early, however, and Hiram felt somewhat grave after the\r\ncorn husking. Had Lettie Bronson invited the country-bred young folk\r\nliving about her father's home, to meet her boarding school friends,\r\nand the town boys, merely that the latter might be compared with the\r\nfarmer-folk to their disfavor?\r\n\r\nHe could not believe that--really. Lettie Bronson might be thoughtless,\r\nand a little proud; but she was still a princess to Hiram, and he could\r\nnot think this evil of her.\r\n\r\nBut there were too many duties every day for the young farmer to give\r\nmuch thought to such problems. Harvesting was not complete yet, and\r\nsoon flurries of snow began to drive across the fields and threaten the\r\napproach of winter.\r\n\r\nFinally the wind came out of the northwest for more than a day, and\r\ntoward evening the flakes began to fall, faster and faster, thicker and\r\nthicker.\r\n\r\n“It's going to be a snowy night--a real baby blizzard,” declared Hiram,\r\nstamping his feet on the porch before coming into the warm kitchen with\r\nthe milkpail.\r\n\r\n“Oh, dear! And I thought you'd go over to Pollock's with me to-night,\r\nHi,” said Sister.\r\n\r\n“Mabel an' I are goin' to make our Christmas presents together, and\r\nshe's expecting me.”\r\n\r\n“Shucks! 'Twon't be fit for a girl to go out if it snows,” said Mother\r\nAtterson.\r\n\r\nBut Hiram saw that Sister was much disappointed, and he had tried to be\r\nkinder to her since that night of the corn husking.\r\n\r\n“What's a little snow?” he demanded, laughing. “Bundle up good, Sister,\r\nand I'll go over with you. I want to see Henry, anyway.”\r\n\r\n“Crazy young'uns,” observed Mother Atterson. But she made no real\r\nobjection. Whatever Hiram said was right, in the old lady's eyes.\r\n\r\nThey tramped through the snowy fields with a lantern, and found it\r\nhalf-knee deep in some drifts before they arrived at the Pollocks, short\r\nas had been the duration of the fall.\r\n\r\nBut they were welcomed vociferously at the neighbor's; preparations were\r\nmade for a long evening's fun; for with the snow coming down so steadily\r\nthere would be little work done out of doors the following day, so the\r\nfamily need not seek their beds early.\r\n\r\nThe Pollock children had made a good store of nuts, like the squirrels;\r\nand there was plenty of corn to pop, and molasses for candy, or\r\ncorn-balls, and red apples to roast, and sweet cider from the casks in\r\nthe cellar.\r\n\r\nThe older girls retired to a corner of the wide hearth with their\r\nwork-boxes, and Hiram and Henry worked out several problems regarding\r\nthe latter's eleven-week course at the agricultural college, which would\r\nbegin the following week; while the young ones played games until they\r\nfell fast asleep in odd corners of the big kitchen.\r\n\r\nIt was nearly midnight, indeed, when Hiram and Sister started home. And\r\nit was still snowing, and snowing heavily.\r\n\r\n“We'll have to get all the plows out to-morrow morning!” Henry shouted\r\nafter them from the porch.\r\n\r\nAnd it was no easy matter to wade home through the heavy drifts.\r\n\r\n“I never could have done it without you, Hi,” declared the girl, when\r\nshe finally floundered onto the Atterson porch, panting and laughing.\r\n\r\n“I'll take a look around the barns before I come in,” remarked the\r\ncareful young farmer.\r\n\r\nThis was a duty he never neglected, no matter how late he went to bed,\r\nnor how tired he was. Half way to the barn he halted. A light was waving\r\nwildly by the Dickerson back door.\r\n\r\nIt was a lantern, and Hiram knew that it was being whirled around and\r\naround somebody's head. He thought he heard, too, a shouting through the\r\nfalling snow.\r\n\r\n“Something's wrong over yonder,” thought the young farmer.\r\n\r\nHe hesitated but for a moment. He had never stepped upon the Dickerson\r\nplace, nor spoken to Sam Dickerson since the trouble about the turkeys.\r\nThe lantern continued to swing. Eagerly as the snow came down, it could\r\nnot blind Hiram to the waving light.\r\n\r\n“I've got to see about this,” he muttered, and started as fast as he\r\ncould go through the drifts, across the fields.\r\n\r\nSoon he heard the voice shouting. It was Sam Dickerson. And he evidently\r\nhad been shouting to Hiram, seeing his lantern in the distance.\r\n\r\n“Help, Strong! Help!” he called.\r\n\r\n“What is it, man?” demanded Hiram, climbing the last pair of bars and\r\nstruggling through the drifts in the dooryard.\r\n\r\n“Will you take my horse and go for the doctor? I don't know where Pete\r\nis--down to Cale Schell's, I expect.”\r\n\r\n“What's the matter, Mr. Dickerson?”\r\n\r\n“Sarah's fell down the bark stairs--fell backward. Struck her head an'\r\nain't spoke since. Will you go, Mr. Strong?”\r\n\r\n“Certainly. Which horse will I take?”\r\n\r\n“The bay's saddled-under the shed--get any doctor--I don't care which\r\none. But get him here.”\r\n\r\n“I will, Mr. Dickerson. Leave it to me,” promised Hiram, and ran to the\r\nshed at once.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXI. “MR. DAMOCLES'S SWORD”\r\n\r\nHiram Strong was not likely to forget that long and arduous night. It\r\nwas impossible to force the horse out of a walk, for the drifts were in\r\nsome places to the creature's girth.\r\n\r\nHe stopped at the house for a minute and roused Mrs. Atterson and Old\r\nLem and sent them over to help the unhappy Dickersons.\r\n\r\nHe was nearly an hour getting to the crossroads store. There were lights\r\nand revelry there. Some of the lingering crowd were snowbound for the\r\nnight and were making merry with hard cider and provisions which Schell\r\nwas not loath to sell them.\r\n\r\nPete was one of the number, and Hiram sent him home with the news of his\r\nmother's serious hurt.\r\n\r\nHe forced the horse to take him into town to Dr. Broderick. It was\r\nnearly two o'clock when he routed out the doctor, and it was four\r\no'clock when the physician and himself, in a heavy sleigh and behind a\r\npair of mules, reached the Dickerson farmhouse.\r\n\r\nThe woman had not returned to consciousness, and Mrs. Atterson remained\r\nthrough the day to do what she could. But it was many a tedious week\r\nbefore Mrs. Dickerson was on her feet again, and able to move about.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, more than one kindly act had Mother Atterson done for the\r\nneighbors who had seemed so careless of her rights. Pete never appeared\r\nwhen either Mrs. Atterson or Sister came to the house; but in his sour,\r\ngloomy way, Sam Dickerson seemed to be grateful.\r\n\r\nHiram kept away, as there was nothing he could do to help them. And he\r\nsaw when Pete chanced to pass him, that the youth felt no more kindly\r\ntoward him than he had before.\r\n\r\n“Well, let him be as ugly as he wants to be--only let him keep away from\r\nthe place and let our things alone,” thought Hiram. “Goodness knows! I'm\r\nnot anxious to be counted among Pete Dickerson's particular friends.”\r\n\r\nThanksgiving came on apace, and every one of the old boarders of\r\nMother Atterson had written that he would come to the farm to spend the\r\nholiday. Even Mr. Peebles acknowledged the invitation with thanks, but\r\nadding that he hoped Sister would not forget he must “eschew any viands\r\nat all greasy, and that his hot water was to be at 101, exactly.”\r\n\r\n“The poor ninny!” ejaculated Mother Atterson. “He doesn't know what he\r\nwants. Sister only poured it out of the teakettle, and he had to wait\r\nfor it to cool, anyway, before he could drink it.”\r\n\r\nBut it was determined to give the city folk a good time, and this\r\ndetermination was accomplished. Two of Sister's turkeys, bought and\r\npaid for in hard cash by Mother Atterson, graced the long table in the\r\nsitting-room.\r\n\r\nMany of the good things with which the table was laden came from the\r\nfarm. And, without Hiram and Sister, and Old Lem Camp, Mrs. Atterson\r\nmade even Fred Crackit understand, these good things had not been\r\npossible!\r\n\r\nBut the Crawberry folk, as a whole, were much subdued. They had missed\r\nMother Atterson dreadfully; and, really, they had felt some affection\r\nfor their old landlady, after all.\r\n\r\nAfter dinner Fred Crackit, in a speech that was designed to be humorous,\r\npresented a massive silver plated water-pitcher with “Mother Atterson”\r\n engraved upon it. And really, the old lady broke down at that.\r\n\r\n“Good Land o' Goshen!” she exclaimed. “Why, you boys do think something\r\nof the old woman, after all, don't ye?\r\n\r\n“I must say that I got ye out here more than anything to show ye what we\r\ncould do in the country. 'Specially how it had improved Sister. And how\r\nHiram Strong warn't the ninny you seemed to think he was. And that Mr.\r\nCamp only needed a chance to be something in the world again.\r\n\r\n“Well, well! It wasn't a generous feeling I had toward you, mebbe; but\r\nI'm glad you come and--I hope you all had enough gravy.”\r\n\r\nSo the occasion proved a very pleasant one indeed. And it made a happy\r\nbreak in the hard work of preparing for the winter.\r\n\r\nThe crops were all gathered ere this, and they could make up their books\r\nfor the season just passed.\r\n\r\nBut there was wood to get in, for all along they had not had wood\r\nenough, and to try and get wood out of the snowy forest in winter for\r\nimmediate use in the stoves was a task that Hiram did not enjoy.\r\n\r\nHe had Henry to help him saw a goodly pile before the first snow fell;\r\nand Mr. Camp split most of it and he and Sister piled it in the shed.\r\n\r\n“We've got to haul up enough logs by March--or earlier--to have a wood\r\nsawing in earnest,” announced Hiram. “We must get a gasoline engine and\r\nsaw, and call on the neighbors for help, and have a sawing-bee.”\r\n\r\n“But what will be the use of that if we've got to leave here in\r\nFebruary?” demanded Mrs. Atterson, worriedly. “The last time I saw that\r\nPepper in town he grinned at me in a way that made me want to break my\r\nold umbrel' over his dratted head!”\r\n\r\n“I don't care,” said Hiram, sullenly. “I don't want to sit idle all\r\nwinter. I'll cut the logs, anyway, and draw 'em out from time to time.\r\nIf we have to leave, why, we have to, that's all.”\r\n\r\n“And we can't tell a thing to do about next year till we know what\r\nPepper is going to do,” groaned Mrs. Atterson.\r\n\r\n“That is very true. But if he doesn't exercise his option before\r\nFebruary tenth, we needn't worry any more. And after that will be time\r\nenough to make our plans for next season's crops,” declared Hiram,\r\ntrying to speak more cheerfully.\r\n\r\nBut Mrs. Atterson went around with clouded brow again, and was heard to\r\nwhisper, more than once, something about “Mr. Damocles's sword.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXII. THE CLOUD IS LIFTED\r\n\r\nDespite Hiram Strong's warning to his employer when they started work\r\non the old Atterson Eighty, that she must expect no profit for this\r\nseason's, work, the Christmas-tide, when they settled their accounts for\r\nthe year, proved the young fellow to have been a bad prophet.\r\n\r\n“Why, Hiram, after I pay you this hundred dollars, I shall have a little\r\nmoney left--I shall indeed. And all that corn in the crib--and stacks of\r\nfodder, beside the barn loft full, and the roots, and the chickens, and\r\nthe pork, and the calf----”\r\n\r\n“Why, Hiram! I'm a richer woman to-day than when I came out here to the\r\nfarm, that's sure. How do you account for it?”\r\n\r\nHiram had to admit that they had been favored beyond his expectations.\r\n\r\n“If that Pepper man would only come for'ard and say what he was going to\r\ndo!” sighed Mother Atterson.\r\n\r\nThat was the continual complaint now. As the winter advanced all four\r\nof the family bore the option in mind continually. There was talk of the\r\nrailroad going before the Legislature to ask for the condemnation of the\r\nproperty it needed, in the spring.\r\n\r\nIt seemed pretty well settled that the survey along the edge of the\r\nAtterson Eighty would be the route selected. And, if that was the case,\r\nwhy did Pepper not try to exercise his option?\r\n\r\nMr. Strickland had said that there was no way by which the real estate\r\nman's hand could be forced; so they had to abide Pepper's pleasure.\r\n\r\n“If we only knew we'd stay,” said Hiram, “I'd cut a few well grown pine\r\ntrees, while I am cutting the firewood, have them dragged to the mill,\r\nand saw the boards we shall need if we go into the celery business this\r\ncoming season.”\r\n\r\n“What do you want boards for?” demanded Henry, who chanced to be home\r\nover Christmas, and was at the house.\r\n\r\n“For bleaching. Saves time, room, and trouble. Banking celery, even with\r\na plow, is not alone old-fashioned, and cumbersome, but is apt to leave\r\nthe blanched celery much dirtier.”\r\n\r\n“But you'll need an awful lot of board for six acres, Hiram!” gasped\r\nHenry.\r\n\r\n“I don't know. I shall run the trenches four feet apart, and you mustn't\r\nsuppose, Henry, that I shall blanch all six acres at once. The boards\r\ncan be used over and over again.”\r\n\r\n“I didn't think of that,” admitted his friend.\r\n\r\nHenry was eagerly interested in his selected studies at the experiment\r\nstation and college, and Abel Pollock followed his son's work there with\r\ngrowing approval, too.\r\n\r\n“It does beat all,” he admitted to Hiram, “what that boy has learned\r\nalready about practical things. Book-farming ain't all flapdoodle,\r\nthat's sure!”\r\n\r\nSo the year ended--quietly, peacefully, and with no little happiness\r\nin the Atterson farmhouse, despite the cloud that overshadowed the\r\nfarm-title, and the doubts which faced them about the next season's\r\nwork.\r\n\r\nThey sat up on New Year's eve to see the old year out and the new in,\r\nand had a merry evening although there were only the family. When the\r\ndistant whistles blew at midnight they went out upon the back porch to\r\nlisten.\r\n\r\nIt was a dark night, for thick clouds shrouded the stars. Only the\r\nunbroken coverlet of snow (it had fallen that morning) aided them to see\r\nabout the empty fields.\r\n\r\nIn the far distance was the twinkle of a single light--that in an upper\r\nchamber of the Pollock house. Dickersons' was mantled in shadow, and\r\nthose two houses were the only ones in sight of the Atterson place.\r\n\r\n“And I was afraid when we came out here that I'd be dead of loneliness\r\nin a month--with no near neighbors,” admitted Mother Atterson. “But I've\r\nbeen so busy that I ain't never minded it----\r\n\r\n“What's that light, Hiram?”\r\n\r\nHer cry was echoed by Sister. Behind the bam a sudden glow was spreading\r\nagainst the low-hung clouds. It was too far away for one of their\r\nout-buildings to be afire; but Hiram set off immediately, although he\r\nonly had slippers on, for the corner of the barnyard fence.\r\n\r\nWhen he reached this point he saw that one of the fodder stacks in the\r\ncornfield was afire. The whole top of the stack was ablaze.\r\n\r\n“Oh, dear! Oh, dear!” cried Sister, who had followed him. “What can we\r\ndo?”\r\n\r\n“Nothing,”, said Hiram. “There's no wind, and it won't spread to another\r\nstack. But that one is past redemption, for sure!”\r\n\r\nHiram hastened back to the house and put on his boots. But he did not\r\nwade through the snow to the fodder stack that was burning so briskly.\r\nHe merely made a detour around it, at some yards distant. Nowhere did he\r\nsee the mark of a footprint.\r\n\r\nHow the stack had been set afire was a mystery. Hiram had stacked the\r\nfodder himself, with the help of Sister, who had pitched the bundles up\r\nto him. The young farmer did not smoke, and he seldom carried matches\r\nloose in his pockets.\r\n\r\nTherefore, the idea that he had dropped a match in the fodder and a\r\nfield mouse, burrowing for some nubbin of corn, had come across the\r\nmatch, nibbled the head, and so set the blaze, was scarcely feasible.\r\n\r\nYet, how else had the fire started?\r\n\r\nWhen daylight came Hiram could find no footprint near the stack--only\r\nhis own where he had circled it while it was blazing.\r\n\r\nIt was the stack nearest to the Dickerson line. Hiram, naturally,\r\nthought of Pete.\r\n\r\nSince Mrs. Dickerson's sickness, Mother Atterson had been back and forth\r\nto help her neighbor, and whenever Sam Dickerson saw Hiram he was as\r\nfriendly as it was in the nature of the man to be.\r\n\r\nHiram could not believe that Pete's father would now countenance any\r\nof his son's meannesses; yet when the young farmer went along the line\r\nfence, he saw fresh tracks across the Dickerson fields, and discovered\r\nwhere the person had stood, on the Dickerson side of the fence opposite\r\nthe burned fodder stack.\r\n\r\nBut these footprints were all of three hundred feet from the stack, and\r\nthere was not a mark in the snow upon Hiram's side of the fence, saving\r\nhis own footprints.\r\n\r\n“Maybe somebody merely ran across to look at the blaze. But it's strange\r\nI did not see him,” thought Hiram.\r\n\r\nHe could not help being suspicious, however, and he prowled about the\r\nstacks and the barns more than ever at night. He could not shake off the\r\nfeeling that the enemy in the dark was at work again.\r\n\r\nJanuary passed, and the fatal day--the tenth of February--drew nearer\r\nand nearer. If Pepper proposed to exercise his option he must do it on\r\nor before that date.\r\n\r\nNeither Hiram nor Mrs. Atterson had seen the real estate man of late;\r\nbut they had seen Mr. Strickland, and on the final day they drove to\r\ntown to meet Pepper--if the man was going to show up--in the lawyer's\r\noffice.\r\n\r\n“I wouldn't trouble him, if I were you,” advised the lawyer. “But if you\r\ninsist, I'll send over for him.”\r\n\r\n“I want to know what he means by all this,” declared Mrs. Atterson,\r\nangrily. “He's kept me on tenter-hooks for ten months, and there ought\r\nto be some punishment for the crime.”\r\n\r\n“I am afraid he has been within his rights,” said the lawyer, smiling;\r\nbut he sent his clerk for the real estate man, probably being very well\r\nconvinced of the outcome of the affair.\r\n\r\nIn came the snaky Mr. Pepper. The moment he saw Mrs. Atterson and Hiram\r\nhe began to cackle.\r\n\r\n“Ye don't mean to say you come clean in here this stormy day to try and\r\nsell that farm to me?” asked the real estate man. “No, ma'am! Not for no\r\nsixteen hundred dollars. If you'll take twelve----”\r\n\r\nMrs. Atterson could not find words to reply to him; and Hiram felt like\r\nseizing the scoundrel by the scruff of his neck and throwing him down to\r\nthe street. But it was Mr. Strickland who interposed:\r\n\r\n“So you do not propose to exercise your option?”\r\n\r\n“No, indeed-y!”\r\n\r\n“How long since did you give up the idea of purchasing the Atterson\r\nplace?” asked the lawyer, curiously.\r\n\r\n“Pshaw! I gave up the idee 'way back there last spring,” chuckled\r\nPepper.\r\n\r\n“You haven't the paper with you, have you, Mr. Pepper?” asked Mr.\r\nStrickland, quietly.\r\n\r\nThe real estate man looked wondrous sly and tapped the side of his nose\r\nwith a lean finger.\r\n\r\n“Why, I tore up that old paper long ago. It warn't no good to me,” said\r\nPepper. “I wouldn't take the farm at that price for a gift,” and he\r\ndeparted with a sneering smile upon his lips.\r\n\r\n“And well he did destroy it,” declared Mr. Strickland. “It was a\r\nforgery--that is what it was. And if we could have once got Pepper in\r\ncourt with it, he would not have turned another scaly trick for some\r\nyears to come.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIII. “CELERY MAD”\r\n\r\nThe relief to the minds of Hiram Strong and Mrs. Atterson was\r\ntremendous.\r\n\r\nEspecially was the young farmer inspired to greater effort. He saw the\r\nsecond growing season before him. And he saw, too, that now, indeed,\r\nhe had that chance to prove his efficiency which he had desired all the\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nThe past year had cost him little for clothing or other expenses. He had\r\nbanked the hundred dollars Mrs. Atterson had paid him at Christmas.\r\n\r\nBut he looked forward to something much bigger than the other hundred\r\nwhen the next Christmas-tide should come. Twenty-five per cent of all\r\nthe profit of the Atterson Eighty during this second year was to be his\r\nown.\r\n\r\nThe moment “Mr. Damocles's sword”, as Mother Atterson had called it, was\r\nlifted the young farmer jumped into the work.\r\n\r\nHe had already cut enough wood to last the family a year; now he got Mr.\r\nPollock, with his team of mules, to haul it up to the house, and then\r\nsent for the power saw, asked the neighbors to help, and in less than\r\nhalf a day every stick was cut to stove length.\r\n\r\nAs he had time Hiram split this wood and Lem Camp piled it in the shed.\r\nHiram knocked together some extra cold-frames, too, and bought some\r\nsecond-hand sash.\r\n\r\nAnd he had already dug a pit for a twelve-foot hotbed. Now, a\r\ntwelve-foot hotbed will start an enormous number of plants.\r\n\r\nHiram did not plan to have quite so much small stuff in the garden this\r\nyear, however. He knew that he should have less time to work in the\r\ngarden. He proposed having more potatoes, about as many tomatoes as the\r\nyear before, but fewer roots to bunch, salads and the like. He must give\r\nthe bulk of his time to the big commercial crop that he hoped to put\r\ninto the bottom-land.\r\n\r\nHe had little fear of the river overflowing its banks late enough in the\r\nseason to interfere with the celery crop. For the seedlings were to be\r\nhandled in the cold-frames and garden-patch until it was time to set\r\nthem in the trenches. And that would not be until July.\r\n\r\nHe contented himself with having the logs he cut drawn to the sawmill\r\nand the sawed planks brought down to the edge of the bottom-land, and\r\ndid not propose to put a plow into the land until late June.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile he started his celery seed in shallow boxes, and when the\r\nplants were an inch and a half, or so, tall, he pricked them out, two\r\ninches apart each way into the cold-frames.\r\n\r\nSister and Mr. Camp could help in this work, and they soon filled the\r\ncold-frames with celery plants destined to be reset in the garden plat\r\nlater.\r\n\r\nThis “handling” of celery aids its growth and development in a most\r\nwonderful manner. At the second transplanting, Hiram snipped back the\r\ntops, and the roots as well, so that each plant would grow sturdily and\r\nnot be too “stalky”.\r\n\r\nMrs. Atterson declared they were all celery mad. “Whatever will you do\r\nwith so much of the stuff, I haven't the least idee, Hiram. Can you sell\r\nit all? Why, it looks to me as though you had set out enough already to\r\nglut the Crawberry market.”\r\n\r\n“And I guess that's right,” returned Hiram. “Especially if I shipped it\r\nall at once.”\r\n\r\nBut he was aiming higher than the Crawberry market. He had been in\r\ncorrespondence with firms that handled celery exclusively in some of the\r\nbig cities, and before ever he put the plow into the bottom-land he\r\nhad arranged for the marketing of every stalk he could grow on his six\r\nacres.\r\n\r\nIt was a truth that the family of transplanted boarding house people\r\nworked harder this second spring than they had the first one. But they\r\nknew how better, too, and the garden work did not seem so arduous to\r\nSister and Old Lem Camp.\r\n\r\nMrs. Atterson had a fine flock of hens, and they had laid well after the\r\nfirst of December, and the eggs had brought good prices. She planned to\r\nincrease her flock, build larger yards, and in time make a business of\r\npoultry raising, as that would be something that she and Sister could\r\npractically handle alone.\r\n\r\nSister's turkeys had thrived so the year before that she had saved two\r\nhens and a handsome gobbler, and determined to breed turkeys for the\r\nfall market.\r\n\r\nAnd Sister learned a few things before she had raised “that raft\r\nof poults,” as Mother Atterson called them. Turkeys are certainly\r\ncalculated to breed patience--especially if one expects to have a flock\r\nof young Toms and hens fit for killing at Thanksgiving-time.\r\n\r\nShe hatched the turkeys under motherly hens belonging to Mother\r\nAtterson, striving to breed poults that would not trail so far from the\r\nhouse; but as soon as the youngsters began to feel their wings they had\r\ntheir foster-mothers pretty well worn out. One flock tolled the old hen\r\noff at least a mile from the house and Hiram had some work enticing the\r\npoults back again.\r\n\r\nThere was no raid made upon her turkey coops this year, however. Pete\r\nDickerson was not much in evidence during the spring and early summer.\r\nMrs. Atterson went back and forth to the neighbors; but although\r\nwhenever Hiram saw the farmer the latter put forth an effort to be\r\npleasant to him, the two households did not well “mix”.\r\n\r\nBesides, during this busiest time of the year, when the crops were\r\ngetting started, there seemed to be little opportunity for social\r\nintercourse. At least, so it seemed on the Atterson place.\r\n\r\nThey were a busy and well contented crew, and everything seemed to be\r\nrunning like clockwork, when suddenly “another dish of trouble”, as\r\nMother Atterson called it, was served them in a most unexpected manner.\r\n\r\nHiram was coming up from the barn one evening, long after dark, and had\r\njust caught sight of Sister standing on the porch waiting for him, when\r\na sudden glow against the dark sky, made him turn.\r\n\r\nThe flash of fire passed on the instant, and Sister called to him:\r\n\r\n“Oh, Hiram! did you see that shooting-star?”\r\n\r\n“You never wished on it, Sis,” said the young farmer.\r\n\r\n“Oh, yes I did!” she returned, dancing down the steps to meet him.\r\n\r\n“That quick?”\r\n\r\n“Just that quick,” she reiterated, seizing his arm and getting into step\r\nwith him.\r\n\r\n“And what was the wish?” demanded Hiram.\r\n\r\n“Why--I won't ever get it if I tell you, will I?” she queried, shyly.\r\n\r\n“Just as likely to as not, Sister,” he said, with serious voice. “Wishes\r\nare funny things, you know. Sometimes the very best ones never come\r\ntrue.”\r\n\r\n“And I'm afraid mine will never come true,” she sighed. “Oh, dear! I\r\nguess no amount of wishing will ever bring some things to pass.”\r\n\r\n“Maybe that's so, Sis,” he said, chuckling. “I fancy that getting out\r\nand hustling for the thing you want is the best way to fulfill wishes.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, but I can't do that in this case,” said the girl, shaking her head,\r\nand still speaking very seriously as they came to the porch steps.\r\n\r\n“Maybe I can bring it about for you,” teased Hiram.\r\n\r\n“I guess not,” she said. “I want so to be like other girls, Hiram! I'd\r\nlike to be like that pretty Lettie Bronson. I'm not jealous of her\r\nlooks and her clothes and her good times and all; no, that's not it,”\r\n proclaimed Sister, with a little break in her voice.\r\n\r\n“But I'd like to know who I really be. I want folks, and--and I want to\r\nhave a real name of my own!”\r\n\r\n“Why, bless you!” exclaimed the young fellow, “'Sister' is a nice name,\r\nI'm sure--and we all love it here.”\r\n\r\n“But it isn't a name. They call me Sissy Atterson at school. But it\r\ndoesn't belong to me. I--I've thought lots about choosing a name for\r\nmyself--a real fancy one, you know. There's lots of pretty, names,” she\r\nsaid, reflectively.\r\n\r\n“Cords of 'em,” Hiram agreed.\r\n\r\n“But, you see, they wouldn't really be mine,” said the girl, earnestly.\r\n“Not even after I had chosen them. I want my very own name! I want to\r\nknow who I am and all about myself. And”--with a half strangled sob--“I\r\nguess wishing will never bring me that, will it, Hiram?”\r\n\r\nNever before had the young fellow heard Sister express herself upon this\r\ntopic. He had no idea that the girl felt her unknown and practically\r\nunnamed existence so strongly.\r\n\r\n“I wouldn't care, Sis,” he said, patting her bent shoulders. “We love\r\nyou here just as well as we would if you had ten names! Don't forget\r\nthat.\r\n\r\n“And maybe it won't be all a mystery some day. Your folks may look you\r\nup. They may come here and find you. And they'll be mighty proud of\r\nyou--you've grown so tall and good looking. Of course they will!”\r\n\r\nSister listened to him and gave a little contented sigh. “And then they\r\nmight want to take me away--and I'd fight, tooth and nail, if they tried\r\nit.”\r\n\r\n“What?” gasped Hiram.\r\n\r\n“Of course I would!” said the girl. “Do you suppose I'd give up Mother\r\nAtterson for a dozen families--or for clothes--and houses--or, or\r\nanything?” and she ran into the house leaving the young farmer in some\r\namazement.\r\n\r\n“Ain't that the girl of it?” he muttered, at last. “Yet I bet she is in\r\nearnest about wanting to know about her folks.”\r\n\r\nAnd from that time Hiram thought more about Sister's problem himself\r\nthan he had before. Once, when he went to Crawberry, he went to the\r\ncharitable institution from which Mother Atterson had taken Sister. But\r\nthe matron had heard nothing of the lawyer who had once come to talk\r\nover the child's affairs, and the path of inquiry seemed shut off right\r\nthere by an impassable barrier.\r\n\r\nHowever, this is ahead of our story. On this particular night Hiram\r\nwashed at the pump, and then followed Sister in to supper.\r\n\r\nBefore they were half through Mr. Camp suddenly started from his chair\r\nand pointed through the window.\r\n\r\nFlames were rising behind the barn again!\r\n\r\n“Another stack burning!” exclaimed Hiram, and be shot out of the door,\r\nseizing a pail of water, hoping that he might put it out.\r\n\r\nBut the stack was doomed. He knew it the moment he saw the extent of the\r\nblaze.\r\n\r\nHe kept away from it, as he had before; yet he did not expect to pick up\r\nany trail of the incendiary near the stack.\r\n\r\n“Twice in the same place is too much!” declared the young farmer,\r\nglowing with wrath. “I'm going to have this mystery explained, or know\r\nthe reason why.”\r\n\r\nHe left Mr. Camp to watch the burning fodder, to see that sparks from\r\nthe stack did no harm, and lighting his lantern he went along the line\r\nfence again.\r\n\r\nYes! there were the footprints that he had expected to find. But the\r\nburning stack was even farther from the fence than the first one\r\nhad been--and there were no marks of feet in the soft earth on Mrs.\r\nAtterson's side of the boundary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIV. CLEANING UP A PROFIT\r\n\r\nHiram crawled through the wires, and followed the plain foot-marks back\r\nto the Dickerson sheds. He lost them there, of course, but he knew by\r\nthe size of the footprints that either Sam Dickerson or his oldest son\r\nhad been over to the line fence.\r\n\r\n“And that shooting-star!” considered Hiram. “There was something peculiar\r\nabout that. I wonder if there wasn't a shooting star, also, away back\r\nthere at New Year's when our other stack of fodder was burned?”\r\n\r\nHe loitered about the sheds for a few moments. It appeared as though all\r\nthe Dickersons were indoors. Nobody interfered with him.\r\n\r\nOf a sudden Hiram began to sniff an odor that seemed strange about a\r\ncart-shed. At least, no wise farmer would have naphtha, or gasoline, in\r\nhis outbuildings, for it would make his insurance invalid.\r\n\r\nBut that was the smell Hiram discovered. And he was not long in finding\r\nthe cause of it.\r\n\r\nBack in a dark corner, upon a beam, lay a big sling-shot--one of those\r\nthat boys swing around their heads with a stone in the heel of it, and\r\nthen let go one end to shoot the missile to a distance.\r\n\r\nThe leather loop was saturated with the gasoline, and it had been\r\nscorched, too. The smell of burning, as well as the smell of gasoline,\r\nwas very distinct.\r\n\r\nHiram took the sling-shot with him, and went up to the Dickerson house.\r\n\r\nHe had got along so well with the Dickersons for these past months\r\nthat he honestly shrank from “starting anything” now. Yet he could not\r\noverlook this flagrant piece of malicious mischief. Indeed, it was more\r\nthan that. Two stacks had already been burned, and it might be some of\r\nthe outbuildings--or even Mrs. Atterson's house--next time!\r\n\r\nBesides, Hiram felt himself responsible for his employer's property. The\r\nold lady could not afford to lose the fodder, and Hiram was determined\r\nthat both of the burned stacks should be paid for in full.\r\n\r\nHe looked through the window of the Dickerson kitchen. The family was\r\naround the supper table-Mr. and Mrs. Dickerson, Pete, and the children,\r\nlittle and big. It was a cheerful family group, after all. Rough and\r\nuncouth as the farmer was, Dickerson likely had his feelings like other\r\npeople. Instead of bursting right in at the door as had been Hiram's\r\nintention, and accusing Pete to his face, the indignant young fellow\r\nhesitated.\r\n\r\nHe hadn't any sympathy for Pete, not the slightest. If he gave him--or\r\nthe elder Dickerson--a chance to clear up matters by making good to Mrs.\r\nAtterson for what she had lost, Hiram Strong decided that he was being\r\nvery lenient indeed.\r\n\r\nHe stepped quietly onto the porch and rapped on the door. Then he backed\r\noff and waited for some response from within.\r\n\r\n“Hullo, Mr. Strong!” exclaimed the farmer, coming himself to the “door.\r\nWhy! is that your stack burning?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, sir,” said Hiram, quietly.\r\n\r\n“Another one!”\r\n\r\n“That is the second,” admitted Hiram. “But I don't propose that another\r\nshall be set afire in just the same way.”\r\n\r\nSam Dickerson stepped suddenly down to the young farmer's level, and\r\nasked:\r\n\r\n“What do you mean by that? Do you know how it got afire?”\r\n\r\nHiram held out the sling-shot in the light of his lantern.\r\n\r\n“A rag, saturated with gasoline, was wrapped around a pebble, then set\r\nafire, and stone and blazing rag were shot from our line fence into the\r\nfodderstack.\r\n\r\n“I found the footprints of the incendiary on New Year's morning at the\r\nsame place. And I'll wager a good deal that your son Pete's boots will\r\nfit the footprints over there at the line now!”\r\n\r\nSam Dickerson's face had turned exceedingly red, and then paled. But he\r\nspoke very quietly.\r\n\r\n“What are you going to do with him, Mr. Strong?” he asked. “It will be\r\nfive years for him at least, if you take it to court--and maybe longer.”\r\n\r\n“I don't believe, Mr. Dickerson, that you have upheld Pete in all the\r\nmean tricks he has played on me.”\r\n\r\n“Indeed I haven't! And since I got a look at myself--back there when the\r\nwife was hurt----”\r\n\r\nSam Dickerson's voice broke and he turned away for a moment so that his\r\nvisitor should not see his face.\r\n\r\n“Well!” he continued. “You've got Pete right this time--no doubt of\r\nthat. I dunno what makes him such a mean whelp. I'll lambaste him good\r\nfor this, now I tell you. But the stacks----”\r\n\r\n“Make him pay for them out of his own money. Mrs. Atterson ought not to\r\nlose the stacks,” said Hiram, slowly.\r\n\r\n“Oh, he'll do that, anyway, you can bet!” exclaimed Dickerson, with\r\nconviction.\r\n\r\n“I don't believe that sending a boy like him to jail will either improve\r\nhis morals, or do anybody else any good,” observed Hiram, reflectively.\r\n\r\n“And it'll jest about finish his mother,” spoke Sam.\r\n\r\n“That's right, too,” said the young farmer. “I tell you. I don't want\r\nto see him--not just now. But you do what you think is best about this\r\nmatter, and make Peter pay the bill--ten dollars for the two stacks of\r\nfodder.”\r\n\r\n“He shall do it, Mr. Strong,” declared Sam Dickerson, warmly. “And he\r\nshall beg your pardon, too, or I'll larrup him until he can't stand.\r\nHe's too big for a lickin', but he ain't too big for me to lick!”\r\n\r\nAnd the elder Dickerson was as good as his word. An hour later yells\r\nfrom the cart shed denoted that Pete was finally getting what he should\r\nhave received when he was a younger boy.\r\n\r\nBefore noon Sam marched the youth over to Mrs. Atterson. Pete was very\r\npuffy about the eyes, and his cheeks were streaked with tears. Nor did\r\nhe seem to care to more than sit upon the extreme edge of a chair.\r\n\r\nBut he paid Mrs. Atterson ten dollars, and then, nudged by his father,\r\nturned to Hiram and begged the young farmer's pardon.\r\n\r\n“That's all right, etc.,” said Hiram, laying his hand upon the boy's\r\nshoulder. “Just because we haven't got on well together heretofore,\r\nneedn't make any difference between us after this.\r\n\r\n“Come over and see me. If you have time this summer and want the work,\r\nI'll be glad to hire you to help handle my celery crop.\r\n\r\n“Neighbors ought to be neighborly; and it won't do either of us any good\r\nto hug to ourselves any injury which we fancy the other has done. We'll\r\nbe friends if you say so, Peter--though I tell you right now that if you\r\nturn another mean trick against me, I'll take the law into my own hands\r\nand give you worse than you've got already.”\r\n\r\nPete looked sheepish enough, and shook hands. He knew very well that\r\nHiram could do as he promised.\r\n\r\nBut from that time on the young farmer had no further trouble with him.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Hiram's crops on the Atterson Eighty grew almost as well this\r\nsecond season as they had the first. There was a bad drouth this year,\r\nand the upland corn did not do so well; yet the young farmer's corn crop\r\ncompared well with the crops in the neighborhood.\r\n\r\nHe had put in but eight acres of corn this year; but they had plenty of\r\nold corn in the crib when it came time to take down this second season's\r\ncrop.\r\n\r\nIt was upon the celery that Hiram bent all his energies. He had to pay\r\nout considerable for help, but that was no more than he expected. Celery\r\ntakes a deal of handling.\r\n\r\nWhen the long, hot, dry days came, when the uplands parched and the\r\nearth fairly seemed to radiate the heat, the acres of tender plants\r\nwhich Hiram and his helpers had just set out in the trenches began to\r\nwilt most discouragingly.\r\n\r\nHenry Pollock, who did all he could to aid Hiram on the crop, shook his\r\nhead in despair.\r\n\r\n“It's a-layin' down on you, Hiram--it's a-layin' down on you. Another\r\nday like this and your celery crop will be pretty small pertaters!”\r\n\r\n“And that would be a transformation worthy of the attention of all\r\nthe agricultural schools, Henry,” returned the young farmer, grimly\r\nlaughing.\r\n\r\n“You got a heart--to laugh at your own loss,” said Henry.\r\n\r\n“There isn't any loss--yet,” declared Hiram.\r\n\r\n“But there's bound to be,” said his friend, a regular “Job's comforter”\r\n for the nonce.\r\n\r\n“Look here, Henry; you'd have me give up too easy. 'Never say die!'\r\nThat's the farmer's motto.”\r\n\r\n“Jinks!” exclaimed young Pollock, “they're dying all around us just the\r\nsame--and their crops, too. We ain't going to have half a corn crop if\r\nthis spell of dry weather keeps on. And the papers don't give us a sign\r\nof hope.”\r\n\r\n“When there doesn't seem to be a sign of hope is when the really\r\nup-to-date farmer begins to actually work,” chuckled Hiram.\r\n\r\n“And just tell me what you're going to do for this field of wilted\r\ncelery?” demanded Henry.\r\n\r\n“Come on up to the house and I'll get Mother Atterson to give us an\r\nearly supper,” quoth Hiram. “I'm going to town and I invite you to go\r\nwith me.”\r\n\r\nHenry had got used by this time to Hiram's little mysteries. But this\r\nseemed to him a case where man had done all that could be done for the\r\ncrop, and without Providential interposition, “the whole field would\r\nhave to go to pot”, as he expressed it.\r\n\r\nAnd in his heart the young farmer knew that the outlook for a paying\r\ncrop of celery right then was very small indeed. He had done his best\r\nin preparing the soil, in enriching it, in raising the sets and\r\ntransplanting them--up to this point he had brought his big commercial\r\ncrop, at considerable expense. If the drouth really “got” it, he would\r\nhave, at the most, but a poor and stunted crop to ship in the Fall.\r\n\r\nBut Hiram Strong was not the fellow to throw up his hands and own\r\nhimself beaten at such a time as this. Here was an obstacle that must\r\nbe overcome. The harder the problem looked the more determined he was to\r\nsolve it.\r\n\r\nThe two boys drove to town that evening and Hiram sought out a man who\r\ncontracted to move houses, clean cisterns and wells, and various work\r\nof that kind. He knew this man had just the thing he needed, and after\r\na conference with him, Hiram loaded some bulky paraphernalia into the\r\nlight wagon--it was so dark Henry could not see what it was--and they\r\ndrove home again.\r\n\r\n“I'd like to know what the Jim Hickey you're about, Hiram,” sniffed\r\nHenry, in disgust. “What's all this litter back here in the wagon?”\r\n\r\n“You come over and give me a hand in the morning--early now, say by\r\nsun-up--and you'll find out. I want a couple of husky chaps like you,”\r\n chuckled Hiram. “I'll get Pete Dickerson to work against me.”\r\n\r\n“If you do, you tell Pete he'll have to work lively,” said Henry, with\r\na grin. “I don't know what it is you want us to do, but I reckon I can\r\nkeep my end up with Pete, from hoein' 'taters to cuttin' cord-wood.”\r\n\r\n“You can keep your end up with him, can you?” chuckled Hiram. “Well! I\r\nbet you can't in this game I'm going to put you two fellows up against.”\r\n\r\n“What! Pete Dickerson beat me at anything--unless it's sleeping?”\r\n grunted Henry, with vast disgust. “I'll keep my end up with him at\r\nanything.”\r\n\r\nAnd the more assured he was of this the more Hiram was amused. “Come\r\non over early, Henry,” said the young farmer, “and I'll show you that\r\nthere's at least one thing in which you can't keep your end up with\r\nPete.”\r\n\r\nHis friend was almost angry when he started off across the fields for\r\nhome; but he was mighty curious, too. That curiosity, if nothing\r\nmore, would have brought him to the Atterson house in good season the\r\nfollowing morning.\r\n\r\nAlready, however, Hiram and Pete--with the light wagon--had gone down\r\nto the riverside. Henry hurried after them and reached the celery field\r\njust as the red face of the sun appeared.\r\n\r\nThere had been little dew during the night and the tender transplants\r\nhad scarcely lifted their heads. Indeed, the last acre set out the day\r\nbefore were flat.\r\n\r\nOn the bank of the river, and near that suffering acre, were Hiram and\r\nPete Dickerson. Henry hurried to them, wondering at the thing he saw\r\nupon the bank.\r\n\r\nHiram was already laying out between the celery rows a long hosepipe.\r\nThis was attached to a good-sized force-pump, the feedpipe of which was\r\nin the river. It was a two-man pump and was worked by an up-and-down\r\n“brake.”\r\n\r\n“Catch hold here, Henry,” laughed Hiram. “One of you on each side now,\r\nand pump for all you're worth. And see if I'm not right, my boy. You\r\ncan't keep your end up with Pete at this job; for if you do, the water\r\nwon't flow!”\r\n\r\nHenry admitted that he had, been badly sold by the joke; but he was\r\nenthusiastic in his praise of Hiram's ingenuity, too.\r\n\r\n“Aw, say!” said the young farmer, “what do you suppose the Good Lord\r\ngave us brains for? Just so as to keep our fingers out of the fire? No,\r\nsir! With all this perfectly good and wet water running past my field,\r\ncould I have the heart to let this celery die? I guess not!”\r\n\r\nHe had a fine spray nozzle on the pipe and the pipe itself was long\r\nenough so that, by moving the pump occasionally, he could water every\r\nsquare foot of the big piece. And the three young fellows, by changing\r\nabout, went over the field every other day in about four hours without\r\ndifficulty.\r\n\r\nBy and by the celery plants got rooted well; they no longer drooped in\r\nthe morning; before the drouth was past the young farmer had as handsome\r\na field of celery as one would wish. Indeed, when he began to ship the\r\ncrop, even his earliest crates were rated A-1 by the produce men, and he\r\nbad no difficulty in selling the entire crop at the top of the market,\r\nright through the season.\r\n\r\nThe garden paid a profit; the potatoes did even better than the year\r\nbefore, and Hiram harvested and sold seventy-five dollars' worth while\r\nthe price for new potatoes was high.\r\n\r\nHe shipped most of his tomatoes this year, for he could not pay\r\nattention to the local market as he had the first season; but the tomato\r\ncrop was a good one.\r\n\r\nThey raised to eight weeks and sold, during the year, five pair of\r\nshoats, and Mrs. Atterson bought a grade cow with her calf by her side,\r\nfor a hundred dollars, and made ten pounds of butter a week right\r\nthrough the season.\r\n\r\nOld Lem Camp, looking ten years younger than when he came to the farm,\r\nmuscular and brown, did all the work about the barns now, milked the\r\ncows, and relieved Hiram of all the chores.\r\n\r\nIndeed, with some little help about the plowing and cultivating, Hiram\r\nknew very well that Mrs. Atterson and Old Lem could run the farm another\r\nyear without his help.\r\n\r\nOf course, the old lady could not expect to put in any crop that would\r\npay her like the celery; for when they footed up their books, the\r\nbottom-land had yielded, as Hiram had once prophesied to Mr. Bronson\r\nover four hundred dollars the acre, net.\r\n\r\nTwenty-four hundred dollars income from six acres; and the profit was\r\nmore than fifty per cent. Indeed, Hiram's share of the profit amounted\r\nto three hundred and seventy dollars.\r\n\r\nWith his hundred dollar wage, and the money he had saved the previous\r\nseason, when the crops were harvested this second season, the young\r\nfarmer's bank book showed a balance of over five hundred dollars to his\r\ncredit.\r\n\r\n“I'm eighteen years old and over,” soliloquized the young farmer. “And\r\nI've got a capital of five hundred dollars. Can't I turn that capital\r\nsome way go as to give me a bigger--a broader--chance?\r\n\r\n“Thus far I've been a one-horse farmer; I want to be something better\r\nthan that. Now, there's no use in my hanging around here, waiting for\r\nsomething to turn up. I must get a move on me and turn something up for\r\nmyself.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXV. LOOKING AHEAD\r\n\r\nDuring this year Hiram had not seen much of Mr. Bronson, or Lettie. They\r\nhad gone back to the West over the summer vacation, and when Lettie\r\nhad returned for her last year at St. Beris, her father had not come on\r\nuntil near Thanksgiving.\r\n\r\nHiram had spoken with Lettie several times during the fail, and he\r\nthought that she had vastly improved in one way, at least.\r\n\r\nShe could not be any prettier, it seemed to him; but her manner was more\r\ncordial, and she always asked after Sister and Mrs. Atterson, and showed\r\nthat her interest in him was not a mere surface interest.\r\n\r\nOne day, when Hiram had been shipping some of the last of his celery,\r\nLettie met him on the street near the Scoville railroad station. Hiram\r\nwas in his high boots, and overalls; and Lettie was with two of her girl\r\nfriends.\r\n\r\nBut the girl stopped him and shook hands, and told him that her father\r\nhad arrived and wanted to see him.\r\n\r\n“We want you to come to dinner Saturday evening, Hiram. Father insists,\r\nand I shall be very much disappointed if you do not come.”\r\n\r\n“Why, that's very kind of you, Miss Lettie,” responded the young farmer,\r\nslowly, trying to find some good reason for refusing the invitation. He\r\nwas determined not to be patronized.\r\n\r\n“Now, Hiram! This is very important. We want you to meet somebody,” said\r\nLettie, her eyes dancing. “Somebody very particular. Now! do say you'll\r\ncome like a good boy, and not keep me teasing.”\r\n\r\n“Well, I'll come, Miss Lettie,” he finally agreed, and she gave him a\r\nmost charming smile.\r\n\r\nLettie's two friends had waited for her, very much amused.\r\n\r\n“I declare, Let!” cried one of them--and her voice reached Hiram's ears\r\nquite plainly. “You do have the queerest friends. Why did you stop to\r\nspeak to that yokel?”\r\n\r\n“Hush! he'll hear you,” said Miss Bronson; yet she smiled, too. “So you\r\nthink Hiram is a yokel, do you?”\r\n\r\n“Hiram!” repeated her friend. “Goodness me! I should think the name was\r\nenough. And those boots--and overalls!”\r\n\r\n“Well,” said Lettie, still amused, “I've seen my own father in just such\r\na costume. And you know very well that he is a pretty good looking man,\r\ndressed up.”\r\n\r\n“But Let! your father's never a farmer$” gasped the other girl.\r\n\r\n“Why not?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, she's just joking us,” laughed the third girl. “Of course he's a\r\nfarmer--he owns half a dozen farms. But he's the kind of a farmer who\r\nrides around in his automobile and looks over his crops.”\r\n\r\n“Well, and this young man may do that--in time,” said Lettie. “At least,\r\nmy father believes Hi is aimed that way.”\r\n\r\n“Nonsense!”\r\n\r\n“He doesn't look as though he had a cent,” said the third girl.\r\n\r\n“He is putting away more money of his very own in the bank than any boy\r\nwe know, who works. Father says so,” declared Lettie. “He says Hi has\r\ndone wonderfully well with his crops this year--and he is only raising\r\nthem on shares.\r\n\r\n“Let me tell you, girls, the farmer is coming into his own, these\r\ndays. That is a great saying of father's. He believes that the man\r\nwho produces the food-stuffs for the rest of the world should have a\r\nsatisfactory share of the proceeds of their sale. And that is coming,\r\nfather says.\r\n\r\n“Farmers don't have to half starve, and be burdened by mortgages and\r\nignorance, any longer. The country sections are waking up. With good\r\nschools and good roads, and the grange, and all, many rural districts\r\nare already ahead of the cities in the things worth while.”\r\n\r\n“Listen to Let lecture!” sniffed one of her friends.\r\n\r\n“All right. You wait. Maybe you'll see that same young fellow--Hi\r\nStrong--come through this town in his own auto before you graduate from\r\nSt. Beris.”\r\n\r\n“Pshaw!” exclaimed the other. “If I do I'll ask him for a ride,” and the\r\ndiscussion ended in a laugh.\r\n\r\nPerhaps, however, had Hiram heard all Lettie had said he would not have\r\nbeen so doubtful in regard to fulfilling his promise about taking dinner\r\nwith Mr. Bronson and his daughter on Saturday evening.\r\n\r\nTo tell the truth, the more he thought of it, the more he shrank from\r\nthe ordeal. Once he had hoped Mr. Bronson would be the one to show him\r\nthe way out of the backwater of Crawberry. Hiram had not forgotten how\r\nterribly disappointed he had been when he could not find the gentleman's\r\ncard in the sewer excavation.\r\n\r\nAnd later, when Mr. Bronson had suggested that he leave Mrs. Atterson\r\nand come to him to work, Hiram feared that he had missed an opportunity\r\nthat would never be offered him again. His contract was practically\r\nover with his present employer, and Hiram's ambition urged him to desire\r\ngreater things in the farming line.\r\n\r\nIt might be in Mr. Bronson's power to aid the young farmer right along\r\nthis line. The gentleman owned farms in the Middle West that were being\r\ntilled on up-to-date methods, and by modern machinery. Hiram desired\r\nvery strongly to get upon a place of that character. He wished to learn\r\nhow to handle tools and machinery which it would never pay a “one-horse\r\nfarmer” to own. But how deeply had the gentleman been offended\r\nby Hiram's refusal to come to work for him when he gave him that\r\nopportunity? That was a question that bit deep into the young farmer's\r\nmind.\r\n\r\nWhen he went to the Bronson's house on Saturday, in good season, Mr.\r\nBronson met him cordially, in the library.\r\n\r\n“Well, my boy, they all tell me you have done it!” exclaimed the\r\nWesterner.\r\n\r\n“Done what?” queried Hiram.\r\n\r\n“Made the most money per acre for Mrs. Atterson that this county ever\r\nsaw. Is that right?”\r\n\r\n“I've succeeded in what I set out to do,” said Hiram, modestly.\r\n\r\n“And I did not believe myself that you could do it,” declared the\r\ngentleman. “And it's too bad, too, that I was a Doubting Thomas,” added\r\nMr. Bronson, his eyes beginning to dance a good deal like Lettie's.\r\n\r\n“You see, Hiram, I had it in my mind when I took this place to get a\r\nyoung men from around here and teach him something of my ways of work,\r\nand finally take him back West with me.\r\n\r\n“I have several farms that are paying me good incomes; but good\r\nfarm-managers are hard to get. I wanted to train one--a young man. I\r\nran against a promising lad before you came to the Atterson place; but I\r\nlost track of him.\r\n\r\n“Had you been willing to leave Mrs. Atterson and come to me,” continued\r\nMr. Bronson, “I believe I could have licked you into shape last season\r\nso that you would have suited me very well,” and he laughed outright.\r\n\r\n“But now I want you to meet my future farm-manager. He is the very\r\nfellow I wanted before I offered the chance to you. I reckon you'll be\r\nglad to see him----”\r\n\r\nWhile he was talking, Mr. Bronson had put his hand on Hiram's shoulder,\r\nand urged him down the length of the room. They had come to a heavy\r\nportiere; Hiram thought it masked a doorway.\r\n\r\n“Here is the fellow himself,” exclaimed Bronson suddenly.\r\n\r\nThe curtain was whisked away. Hiram heard Lettie giggling somewhere\r\nin the folds of it. And he found himself staring straight into a long\r\nmirror which reflected both himself and the laughing Mr. Bronson.\r\n\r\n“Hiram Strong!” spoke the Westerner, admonishingly, “why didn't you tell\r\nme long ago that you were the lad who turned my horses out of the ditch\r\nthat evening back in Crawberry?”\r\n\r\n“Why--why----”\r\n\r\n“His fatal modesty,” laughed Lettie, appearing and clapping her hands.\r\n\r\n“I guess it wasn't that,” said Hiram, slowly. “What was the use? I would\r\nhave been glad of your assistance at the time; but when I found you I\r\nhad already made a contract with Mrs. Atterson, and--what was the use?”\r\n\r\n“Well, perhaps it would have made no difference. When I had dug up the\r\nfact that you were the same fellow whom I had looked for at Dwight's\r\nEmporium, it struck me that possibly the character that old scoundrel\r\ngave you had some basis in fact.\r\n\r\n“So I said nothing to you after you had refused to break your contract.\r\nThat, Hiram, was a good point in your favor. And what that little girl\r\nat your house has told Lettie about you--and the way Mrs. Atterson\r\nspeaks of you, and all--long since convinced me that you were just the\r\nlad I wanted.\r\n\r\n“Now, Hiram, I believe you know a good deal about farming that I don't\r\nknow myself. And, at any rate, if you can do what you have done with a\r\nrun-down place like the Atterson Eighty, I'd like to see what you can do\r\nwith a bigger and better farm.\r\n\r\n“What do you say? Will you come to me--if only for a year? I'll make it\r\nworth your while.”\r\n\r\nAnd that Hiram Strong did not let this opportunity slip past him will be\r\nshown in the next volume of this series, entitled: “Hiram in the Middle\r\nWest; Or, A Young Farmer's Upward Struggle.”\r\n\r\nHe was sorry to leave Mrs. Atterson at Christmas time; but the old lady\r\nsaw that it was to Hiram's advantage to go.\r\n\r\n“And good land o' Goshen, Hiram! I wouldn't stand in no boy's way--not\r\na boy like you, leastways. You've always been square with me, and you've\r\ngiven me a new lease of life. For I never would have dared to give up\r\nthe boarding house and come to the farm if it hadn't been for you.\r\n\r\n“This is your home--jest as much as it is Sister's home, and Old Lem\r\nCamp's. Don't forgit that, Hiram.\r\n\r\n“You'll find us all here whenever you want to come back to it. For I've\r\ntalked with Mr. Strickland and I'm going to adopt Sister, all reg'lar,\r\nand she shall have what I leave when I die, only promising to give Mr.\r\nCamp a shelter, if he should outlast me.\r\n\r\n“Sister's folks may never look her up, and she may never git that money\r\nthe institution folk think is coming to her. But she'll be well fixed\r\nhere, that's sure.”\r\n\r\nIndeed, taking it all around, everybody of importance to the story\r\nseemed to be “well fixed”, as Mother Atterson expressed it. She herself\r\nneed never be disturbed by the vagaries of boarders, or troubled in her\r\nmind, either waking or sleeping, about the gravy--save on Thanksgiving\r\nDay.\r\n\r\nOld Lem Camp and Sister were provided for by their own exertions and\r\nMrs. Atterson's kindness. The Dickersons--even Pete--had become friendly\r\nneighbors. Henry Pollock had waked up his father, and they were running\r\nthe Pollock farm on much more modern lines than before.\r\n\r\nAnd Hiram himself was looking ahead to a scheme of life that suited him,\r\nand to a chance “to make good” on a much larger scale than he had on the\r\nAtterson Eighty where, nevertheless, he had made the soil pay.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's Hiram The Young Farmer, by Burbank L.
