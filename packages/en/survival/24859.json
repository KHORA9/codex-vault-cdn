And there was only one way in which that\r\naim could be accomplished, namely, by carrying passengers to and fro in\r\nless time and greater comfort than any of the competing lines.  The\r\nquestion of cargo did not matter so very much, for at that time--that is\r\nto say, about the year 1860--the steam service to South Africa was very\r\ndifferent from what it is to-day.  The steamers were small, slow, and\r\ninfrequent; Natal was just then attracting a big influx of well-to-do\r\npeople from England; passenger rates were high--as also, for that\r\nmatter, was the freight on such special merchandise as was at that time\r\nbeing carried out to the colony--and those who took credit to themselves\r\nfor their foresight believed that there was big money to be made in the\r\nsailing passenger trade.  Needless to say, the competition between the\r\ndifferent lines was exceedingly keen: but the owners of the \"Queen\" line\r\nwere a very rich corporation; they were prepared to sink money in the\r\neffort to secure a monopoly; and the _Zenobia_ was the latest outcome of\r\ntheir rather speculative policy.\r\n\r\nAt the moment when this story opens--namely, about two bells of the\r\nmiddle watch, on the night of 24 January, 1862--or rather in the early\r\nmorning of 25 January, to be exact--the barque was somewhere about\r\nlatitude 25 degrees south, and longitude 27 degrees west.  I have not\r\nthe precise figures by me, nor do they very greatly matter.  The night\r\nwas fine, clear, and starlit, with the moon, well advanced in her fourth\r\nquarter, hanging a few degrees above the eastern horizon, and shedding\r\njust enough light to touch the wave crests immediately beneath her with\r\nsoft flashes of ruddy golden light.  The wind was piping up fresh from\r\nthe south-east, and the little clipper was roaring through it under all\r\nplain sail to her royals, with the yeast slopping in over her starboard\r\nrail at every lee roll and her lee scuppers all afloat; for quick\r\npassages were the order of the day, quick passages meant \"carrying on\",\r\nand Mr Stephen Bligh, the chief mate and officer of the watch, was\r\nliving fully up to the traditions of the service.  This was the\r\n_Zenobia's_ second outward voyage.  Her first trip had been accomplished\r\nin the unprecedentedly brief period of forty-six days; and it was now\r\nthe ambition of her skipper and his two mates to beat even that\r\nbrilliant record.  And at the moment there seemed an excellent prospect\r\nthat this laudable ambition might be achieved, for the morrow would only\r\nbe our twenty-fourth day out.  We had been extraordinarily lucky in the\r\nmatter of crossing the line, having slid across it with a good breeze,\r\nwhich had run us into the south-east Trades without the loss of a\r\nmoment; and those same south-east Trades--or something remarkably like\r\nthem--were still piping up fresh, although we were by this time well\r\nbeyond their ordinary southern limits.\r\n\r\nOur ship's company amounted to twenty-four all told, namely, Captain\r\nJohn Roberts, our skipper; Mr Stephen Bligh, our chief mate; Mr Peter\r\nJohnson, our second mate; Dr John Morrison, our surgeon--ours being one\r\nof the few ships in the trade which at that time carried a doctor--the\r\nboatswain, carpenter, sailmaker, cook, two stewards, twelve men--of whom\r\neight were A.B.'s and four only O.S.--and last, but not least--in our\r\nown estimation--two apprentices, Tom Bainbridge, in his fifth year of\r\napprenticeship, being one, while I, Mark Temple, just turned seventeen\r\nyears of age, and in the third year of my apprenticeship, was the other.\r\nThere was not much love lost between Bainbridge and myself, by the way,\r\nfor he was of a sullen, sulky temper, and had tried hard to bully me\r\nwhen I first made his acquaintance in the old _Boadicea_ before joining\r\nthe _Zenobia_.  But our mutual ill feeling did not greatly matter, for\r\nhe was in the port watch and I in the starboard, so we very rarely met\r\nexcept when it was a case of \"all hands\"; consequently we had not very\r\nmuch opportunity to quarrel.  And in addition to the above we carried\r\ntwenty cuddy passengers, of whom six were men, while the remainder\r\nconsisted of nine ladies and five children.  I am afraid the above\r\ndetails are not very interesting, but it is necessary to give them in\r\norder that the reader may fully understand what is to follow.\r\n\r\nAs I have already mentioned, this story may be said to have had its\r\nbeginning about two bells in the middle watch--or about one o'clock in\r\nthe morning--on a certain specified date; for until then there had been\r\nnothing out of the ordinary to distinguish the voyage from any other.\r\nBut some five minutes after I had struck two bells, in accordance with\r\nthe chief mate's instructions, and the lookout on the topgallant\r\nforecastle had responded with the usual cry of \"All's well!\" one of the\r\nforecastle hands came slouching along aft, and, ascending the poop\r\nladder with a certain suggestion of haste and trepidation, approached\r\nthe mate.\r\n\r\n\"Will ye mind steppin' for'ard a minute, sir?\" he enquired.  \"There's a\r\nstrong smell o' burnin' down in the fo'c'sle, and--\"\r\n\r\n\"A strong smell of burning?\" interrupted Mr Bligh.  \"The dickens there\r\nis!  Yes, of course I'll go.  Temple,\" turning to me, \"just keep a\r\nlookout for a minute or two while I'm gone, will ye?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ay, ay, sir,\" I replied; and the mate dashed down the poop ladder and\r\nwent scurrying away forward, regardless of the drenching showers of\r\nspray that came flying in over the weather cathead with every mad plunge\r\nof the overdriven ship.\r\n\r\nFor the next five minutes I paced anxiously to and fro along the weather\r\nside of the poop, with my ears wide open for any sudden outcry that\r\nmight confirm the awful suspicion of fire having broken out below; but I\r\nheard nothing save the continuous hiss and roar of the sea under the lee\r\nbow and along the bends, the heavy slop of water in over the rail with\r\nevery lee roll of the ship, and the thunder and piping of the wind\r\naloft, and I was beginning to hope that it was no worse than a false\r\nalarm, when the man who a few minutes previously had come aft to summon\r\nthe mate came running--yes, positively running--along the deck again.\r\nHe stumbled up the poop ladder and came to me, puffing and panting, with\r\nevery sign of the most extreme agitation, and delivered his message.\r\n\r\n\"Mr Temple!\" he gasped--the skipper always insisted upon the\r\n\"midshipmen\" apprentices being \"Mistered\" by the foremast hands, upon\r\nthe ground that we were officers, if only in embryo--\"Mr Temple, the\r\nmate says will ye please slip below and quietly call Cap'n Roberts\r\nwithout disturbin' the passengers.  Ye are to tell him that the ship's\r\nafire in the forehold, and that Mr Bligh will be much obliged if he'll\r\ncome for'ard to the fo'c'sle at once.  And when ye've done that, ye're\r\nto continue your lookout on the poop until ye're relieved.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ay, ay, Mason, I'll do that,\" I answered.  Then, as we turned together\r\nto leave the poop, I asked: \"Is the matter serious, Mason?  Has Mr\r\nBligh actually found the seat of the fire; and is there a chance of our\r\nbeing able to master it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Can't say, as yet,\" answered the man.  \"We ain't actually found the\r\nfire; but it's there all right.\"\r\n\r\nI shivered involuntarily, although the night was warm, for I happened to\r\nknow that a good deal of the cargo which we were carrying was of a\r\nhighly combustible character, such as furniture, pianos, Manchester\r\ngoods, and the like, to say nothing of several cases of sporting\r\nammunition.  I knew that if once the fire happened to get a good hold\r\nupon such material as that the chances were all against our being able\r\nto master it, especially in such a strong breeze as was then blowing.\r\n\r\nAnd if we should be compelled to leave the ship--!\r\n\r\nI thought of those poor helpless women and children peacefully sleeping\r\ndown below, and of what their plight might be if we were driven to take\r\nto the boats out there in the heart of the South Atlantic, hundreds of\r\nmiles from the nearest land.\r\n\r\nTiptoeing my way to the skipper's cabin, I rapped gently with my\r\nknuckles on the panel of the door, and bent my head to listen for a\r\nreply.  I knew that Captain Roberts was a light sleeper, and judged that\r\nit would not take much to awake him.  Nor was I mistaken, for\r\nimmediately following upon my low knock came the quiet reply:\r\n\r\n\"Hillo! who is there, and what is it?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is I--Temple--sir,\" I replied.  \"May I enter?\"\r\n\r\nFor answer I heard the light thud of bare feet inside the cabin as the\r\nskipper sprang from his bunk; and the next instant the door quietly\r\nopened and Captain Roberts stood before me.\r\n\r\n\"What is it, Temple?\" he demanded.  \"Anything wrong?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir, I'm afraid there is,\" I replied in low tones.  \"Mr Bligh is\r\ndown in the forecastle, and he has just sent a message aft to me\r\ndirecting me to call you and say that he is afraid fire has broken out\r\nin the fore hold, and that he will be much obliged if you will kindly go\r\nto him at once.\"\r\n\r\n\"Fire!\" ejaculated the skipper.  \"In the fore hold, you say?  Humph!  I\r\ndon't notice any smell of it here,\" and he started sniffing violently as\r\nhe stooped for his slippers and put them on.  \"Who gave the alarm?\"\r\n\r\n\"Mason, sir,\" I replied.  \"He came aft, just after two bells, and\r\nreported a strong smell of burning down in the forecastle.  Mr Bligh\r\nwent for'ard at once, leaving me to keep a lookout on the poop; and he\r\nhad been gone about five minutes when Mason again came aft with a\r\nmessage directing me to call you.\"\r\n\r\n\"I see,\" answered the skipper.  \"Very well,\" as he emerged from his\r\ncabin and quietly closed the door behind him, \"you go back to the poop\r\nand keep an eye upon the ship.  I shall not be long.\"  And with one\r\nbound, as it seemed to me, he was out on deck and running forward.  As\r\nfor me, I returned to my station on the poop, which I anxiously paced\r\nbackward and forward in momentary expectation of hearing the call for\r\n\"All hands!\"\r\n\r\nBut when I came to look more closely it appeared that any such formal\r\ncall would be quite superfluous, for presently a light flashed out from\r\nthe windows of the small house just abaft the foremast, in which the\r\nboatswain, carpenter, sailmaker, cook, and the two stewards were\r\nberthed, and by its rather feeble beams I perceived that the fore deck\r\nwas full of men crouching under the shelter of the topgallant\r\nforecastle; I presumed, therefore, that upon the first alarm of fire\r\nthey had turned out and dressed, and had been sent on deck by the mate\r\nto be out of the way while the investigation below was being made.  It\r\nwas about this time that I noticed, with keen satisfaction, the fact\r\nthat the wind was not blowing quite as strongly as it had been during\r\nthe earlier part of the watch.\r\n\r\nI was beginning to think that the skipper was remaining below rather a\r\nlong time, and was drawing the most disquieting conclusions from the\r\ncircumstance, when one of the crew--a man whom I recognised as Owen\r\nLloyd, generally known among his messmates as \"Welshy\"--came aft and\r\nentered the little house abaft the main hatch, where Bainbridge and I\r\nhad our lodging.  A few seconds later a small glimmer from the open door\r\nshowed that the man was lighting the lamp which illuminated our\r\nsnuggery; and a minute or two afterwards Lloyd emerged again and went\r\nforward, while Bainbridge also stepped out on deck and disappeared\r\nbeneath the break of the poop.  He was gone some three or four minutes,\r\nthen reappeared, accompanied by Mr Johnson, the second mate, whom he\r\nhad evidently been directed to call, for the pair immediately proceeded\r\nforward at a trot.  I decided that the matter was assuming a distinctly\r\nserious aspect.  Some five minutes later Bainbridge came aft, and,\r\nascending to the poop, remarked to me in his usual surly, offhand\r\nmanner:\r\n\r\n\"You're wanted at once in the forecastle, Temple, and I'm to keep the\r\nlookout in your place.\"\r\n\r\n\"Right!\"  I replied.  \"How are they getting on for'ard?  Have they found\r\nthe fire yet?\"\r\n\r\n\"Go and look for yourself, sonny, and don't waste valuable time in\r\nstopping to ask silly questions,\" was the ungracious reply I received;\r\nand I suppose it was the reflection that it served me right for\r\npersisting in my attempts to be civil to the lout that drove out of my\r\nhead the thought which had flashed into it for an instant, that it was\r\nrather queer that the skipper should have sent for me at a moment when\r\nBainbridge was actually on the spot and would serve his purpose quite as\r\nwell.  So, all unsuspectingly, I trundled away forward, and, flinging my\r\nlegs over the coaming of the fore scuttle, dropped down into the\r\nforecastle, noting _en passant_ that a dozen or more of the hands were\r\nstill huddling together under the shelter of the topgallant forecastle.\r\nAs I was in the very act of swinging myself down off the coaming I\r\nthought I caught the sound of a subdued chuckle emanating from somebody\r\namong this group; but before I had time to give the matter a thought, or\r\nwonder what might be the cause of such ill-timed mirth, my feet reached\r\nthe deck of the forecastle, and I found myself the centre of a group of\r\nsome half a dozen of the crew, with the slush lamp swinging violently\r\nwith the motion of the ship, and darting its feeble rays hither and\r\nthither as it hung suspended from a smoky beam overhead.  And in that\r\nsame instant I caught a momentary glimpse of the forms of Captain\r\nRoberts, Mr Bligh, and Mr Johnson, bound hand and foot, and with gags\r\nin their mouths, huddled up in three of the recently vacated bunks.  As\r\nfor the supposed fire, there was neither sight nor smell of it.\r\n\r\n\"What the--\" I began.  But before I could utter another sound I felt my\r\nhead dragged violently back and a big gag thrust between my jaws, while\r\nmy arms and legs were at the same instant seized by powerful hands and\r\nlashed so securely that I could not have moved either of them by so much\r\nas an inch, no, not to save my life.  The work was done with the speed\r\nand precision that might be expected of men accustomed to the\r\nmanipulation of ropes and the tying of knots; and then I was lifted off\r\nmy feet and flung with scant ceremony into one of the unoccupied bunks.\r\n\r\n\"There! that's the last one; the passengers can be left until to-morrer\r\nmornin' to be dealt with,\" exclaimed a voice which I recognised as that\r\nof \"Welshy\".  \"And now, lads,\" the voice continued, \"let's go on deck\r\nand take some of the `muslin' off her; there's no use in strainin' the\r\nhooker all to pieces, and Bainbridge says as we're quite far enough\r\nsouth a'ready.\"\r\n\r\nBainbridge!  Could it be possible that Bainbridge was mixed up with this\r\nvile conspiracy?  For conspiracy it was, clearly enough, to obtain\r\npossession of the ship without the necessity to fight for her; the bound\r\nforms of the skipper and the two mates--to say nothing of myself--proved\r\nit beyond a doubt.  And a very cunningly devised scheme it was, too,\r\nably planned and most efficiently executed--the enticement of the mate\r\ninto the forecastle by the suggestion of fire; then, after just the\r\nright lapse of time, the fictitious message to the skipper through me,\r\nfollowed by the summons of the second mate, and, finally, the capture of\r\nmy insignificant self.  It was much too subtle a scheme to be evolved by\r\nthe uninventive brain of the average British shellback, and I fancied\r\nthat I recognised a certain Bainbridge-like neatness of touch and finish\r\nin it all.  But perhaps I was prejudiced, for I never liked the fellow.\r\nYet, if he was not in it, why was he still free, instead of being down\r\nin the forecastle, a captive, like the rest of us?  I remembered now\r\nthat on several occasions I had seen him fraternising with the men\r\nfor'ard during the dog-watches; but I had thought nothing of it at the\r\ntime beyond reflecting that to me it seemed to be rather bad form on his\r\npart, and not by any means conducive to good discipline.\r\n\r\nAs I recalled these occasions to mind, while I lay there in that close,\r\nevil-smelling bunk, I idly wondered whether he had used them for the\r\npurpose of seducing the men from their duty and allegiance and\r\npersuading them to join him in this outrageous act of unprovoked mutiny.\r\nFor unprovoked it most assuredly was: the owners were most liberal\r\nproviders, the food was the best obtainable, and the allowance of it far\r\nexceeded the Board of Trade scale; the men had grog as well as lime\r\njuice served out to them regularly every day; the skipper was easy-going\r\nwith them to a degree; and neither of the mates could, by the wildest\r\nstretch of imagination, be termed a slave-driver, although of course\r\nboth exacted a certain amount of daily work; and, finally, the afternoon\r\nwatch below was never called upon except when necessity demanded it; in\r\nshort, the _Zenobia_ was as comfortable a ship as any sailor need wish\r\nto go to sea in.  No; I was certain that this atrocious seizure of the\r\nship had not originated in discontent on the part of the men, who were\r\nneither better nor worse than the average British seaman.  They had been\r\nplayed upon by skilful hands; their baser passions had been so strongly\r\nappealed to that their better judgment had been blinded; and I felt\r\nmorally convinced that there was not a man among the legitimate\r\noccupants of the forecastle who possessed the ability to do this thing.\r\n\r\nThen, I asked myself, who was the master spirit who had contrived so\r\neffectually to blind and mislead those simple-minded men, and so\r\npowerfully to influence them that they had eventually permitted\r\nthemselves to be betrayed into an act that converted them into outlaws,\r\nwith every man's hand against them?  And why had they done it?  They had\r\nno grievance, real or imaginary, against any of their officers: that\r\nfact was patent from the manner in which the seizure of the ship had\r\nbeen effected; there had been none of the brutal violence, the\r\nbloodshed, which usually accompanies a mutiny upon the high seas.  Then\r\nwhy, I mentally repeated, had the men mutinied at all?\r\n\r\nAnd the answer that came to my mind was--Bainbridge!  Yes, prejudice and\r\nill feeling apart, I could think of no other individual in the ship with\r\nthe will and the disposition to concoct and carry out such a scheme.  To\r\nbegin with, he was the only discontented person, so far as I knew, on\r\nthe ship.  And his discontent was of that dangerous kind which is\r\ndissatisfied not with any one particular thing, but with everything.  He\r\nwas poor and--as I understood--practically friendless, except for an\r\nuncle who had apprenticed him to the sea in order to get rid of him; he\r\nwas restive under discipline, his character being strongly imbued with\r\nthat false pride which chafes at a subordinate position.  I had often\r\nheard him declare that he was born to be a leader of men, and had\r\nlaughed at what seemed to me to be his inordinate conceit.  He hated\r\nwork as heartily as he loved trashy, sensational literature; and he\r\ndisplayed a quite childish love of dainty food and showy clothes.  And\r\nthese were not his only faults: he was an unblushing liar; he scoffed at\r\nsuch old-fashioned virtues as honesty and truth and godliness; he\r\nsneered at me every time that he found me on my knees offering up my\r\nmorning and nightly petitions to my Maker; he was cruel when he had the\r\nchance to be so; and, in short, he seemed surcharged with gall and\r\nbitterness.\r\n\r\nHe possessed only one redeeming point, so far as I could ever discover,\r\nand that was that he was a splendid navigator.  He prided himself upon\r\nhis skill with the sextant, and often used to assert--in that cynical\r\nway of his that might be either jest or earnest, one could never tell\r\nwhich--that some day he would become a pirate king and establish himself\r\nmagnificently on some fair island of the Pacific!  Heavens! thought I,\r\ncould it be possible that the fellow had actually been in earnest, and\r\nthat this mutiny was the outcome of his evil ambition?  It certainly\r\nlooked very much like it.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, during the time that these thoughts and speculations had been\r\nrunning through my head, the hands on deck had been noisily engaged in\r\nshortening sail, and from the time that they took about the job, and the\r\neasier, more buoyant movements of the ship, I conjectured that they had\r\ntaken in not only the royals, but also the topgallantsails, together\r\nwith, probably, the flying jib and a few of the lighter staysails.\r\nThen, when the mutineers had done all that they deemed necessary in the\r\nway of shortening sail, four of them came down into the forecastle, and\r\nwith the aid of a rope, the bight of which was passed round our bodies,\r\nthe skipper, the mates, and I were hauled up on deck and carried into\r\nthe fore house, where we found the boatswain, Chips, and Sails as\r\nsecurely trussed up as ourselves.  And there, still gagged and bound\r\nhelplessly hand and foot, we were left to our meditations until, after a\r\nvery eternity, as it seemed, of extreme discomfort, first came the\r\ndaylight and finally eight bells of the morning watch, when the sliding\r\ndoor of the house was thrust open and one of the men entered--a fellow\r\nnamed Adams.\r\n\r\nAfter looking at us meditatively for a moment, and carefully examining\r\nour lashings to assure himself that they still held firmly, he removed\r\nthe gags from our mouths--for which I, for one, was profoundly\r\nthankful--and informed us that breakfast was about to be brought to us,\r\nand that our hands would be loosed to enable us to partake of it.  But\r\nhe warned us that his instructions were to shoot at the slightest sign\r\nof an attempt on our part to break out of the house, or the slightest\r\nuplifting of our voices, and to give point to the statement he exhibited\r\na fully loaded revolver, which Captain Roberts at once recognised as his\r\nown personal property.\r\n\r\n\"And pray, who gave you those instructions, Adams?\" demanded the\r\nskipper.\r\n\r\n\"I ain't allowed to say,\" answered the man.  \"But I was to tell you,\" he\r\ncontinued, \"that you ain't none of yer permitted to talk to any of us\r\nmen, or to ask us any questions; and if you persist in doin' so you're\r\nto be gagged again.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well,\" agreed the skipper artfully; \"then we will not ask you\r\nanything that you feel you ought not to tell.  But I suppose you will\r\nhave no objection to tell me, without asking, what has been done with\r\nregard to the passengers?\"\r\n\r\n\"The gen'lemen have been lashed up, same as yourselves, and locked away,\r\ntwo in a cabin; while the women folk and the kids is locked up all safe\r\nin the other cabins; so there ain't no chancet of none of 'em bein' able\r\nto slip for'ard and help yer anyways.  And now, don't you ask me nothin'\r\nmore, because I ain't goin' to answer yer,\" replied Adams, with some\r\nshow of testiness.\r\n\r\n\"But I suppose you can tell us, if you choose, what your new skipper,\r\nBainbridge, is going to do with us,\" I insinuated.  \"He is not going to\r\nkeep us cooped up here until a man-o'-war comes along and captures the\r\nship, is he?\"\r\n\r\n\"Now, look 'e here, Mister Temple, don't you go for to try to pump me,\r\nor it'll be the worse for yer,\" expostulated Adams.  \"I ain't got\r\nnothin' against you, and I don't want to hurt yer if I can help it, but\r\ns'help me!  I'll have to shove that there gag back into yer mouth if you\r\ndon't clap a stopper on that tongue of yours.  Ah, here comes cooky with\r\nthe grub!\" he announced, with a sigh of relief, as the \"Doctor\" made his\r\nappearance at the door with a well-loaded tray.\r\n\r\nThe picture which that tray presented was conclusive evidence that,\r\nwhatever might be the ultimate intentions of the mutineers toward us,\r\nthey did not mean to starve us to death, for the breakfast that was\r\nplaced before us consisted of the best that the steward's pantry could\r\nproduce.  And we all did the fullest justice to it, even the skipper\r\nmaking a hearty meal, although I believe it was not so much because he\r\nhad a good appetite as that he had a very shrewd suspicion of what lay\r\nbefore him, and was exceedingly doubtful as to when he would next have\r\nthe opportunity to sit down to a good, well-cooked meal.  As for me, I\r\nwas healthily hungry, and was altogether too young and of too sanguine a\r\ntemperament to feel very anxious as to what was to be the outcome of the\r\nadventure; moreover, I was unburdened by responsibility of any sort, and\r\nI therefore ate and drank until I was fully satisfied.\r\n\r\nWe were still busy with our breakfasts when an alteration in the motion\r\nof the ship apprised us all of the fact that the helm had been put up,\r\nand that we were now running off with the wind on our port quarter; and\r\nthe next moment we heard a voice, which I instantly recognised as\r\nBainbridge's, summoning the men to the braces.  The yards were trimmed\r\nvery nearly square, then came an order to loose, sheet home, and hoist\r\naway the topgallantsails and royals; next the men who had gone aloft to\r\nloose those sails were ordered to rig out the port studdingsail-booms\r\nand to set the royal and topgallant studdingsails on their way down; and\r\nfinally the topmast and lower studdingsails were set, and the _Zenobia_\r\nwent rolling and wallowing away to the westward under every rag that\r\ncould be packed upon her.\r\n\r\nNo remark was made upon this so long as the man Adams remained with us;\r\nbut when at length we had finished our breakfast, had reluctantly\r\nsubmitted to be trussed up again--because we could not help ourselves,\r\nand nothing could be gained by offering an unavailing resistance--and\r\nwere once more shut in and left to ourselves, the skipper turned to Mr\r\nBligh and remarked:\r\n\r\n\"Now, what does the scoundrel mean by this shift of helm, think you?  We\r\nare only about four or five degrees to the southward of Rio at this\r\nmoment.  Can the man be such a fool as to think of running in until he\r\nsights the coast and then turning us adrift to get ashore as best we\r\ncan?  Because, if he does, we'll have a British man-o'-war after him in\r\nno time.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't believe the boy is quite such an ass as that; indeed, I regard\r\nhim as being very far from an ass--except in this one particular\r\ninstance of organising this mutiny,\" answered Bligh.  \"I haven't the\r\nslightest notion of what he intends to be after, but I think we may be\r\nquite certain that Bainbridge won't give us much of a chance to report\r\nhim until he has had time to get well out of the neighbourhood.  What\r\nsay you, Johnson?  He was in your watch, and you should know him a good\r\ndeal better than I do.\"\r\n\r\n\"If you are speaking of Bainbridge,\" answered the second mate, \"I fully\r\nagree with you that he is very far from being a fool--quite the other\r\nway about, indeed; and from what I know of the young villain I should\r\nsay that he may be depended upon to give us the smallest possible chance\r\nof reporting him quickly.  My opinion is this.  So far, and up to the\r\nmoment of shifting her helm, the _Zenobia_ has been following the usual\r\nship track to the south'ard and round the Cape; hence we have been\r\nliable to fall in at any moment with other ships, which would not\r\nexactly suit Bainbridge's book.  Therefore he has shifted his helm and\r\nis now running off the track far enough to avoid meeting with other\r\nships.  In my opinion he will continue so to run until he considers\r\nhimself quite out of danger; but what he will do afterward, and how he\r\nwill dispose of us, I'll leave it to a better guesser than myself to\r\nimagine.  The only thing that I feel at all certain about is that he\r\nwill not murder us; if he had intended to do that he would not have\r\ntaken such elaborate pains to get us alive and uninjured into his\r\npower.\"\r\n\r\n\"Quite so; I fully agree with you there,\" returned the skipper.  \"The\r\nthing that I can't fathom is the young scoundrel's motive for taking the\r\nship, and what he proposes to do with her now that he has her.  By the\r\nway, Mr Temple, it was you, I think, who first named Bainbridge as the\r\nringleader of this rascally job; what led you to fix it upon him so\r\npat?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, sir,\" said I, \"the fact is that after they brought us in here and\r\nleft us, bound hand and foot and gagged, so that we could neither move\r\nnor talk, I endeavoured to beguile the time by asking myself who was\r\nresponsible for the seizure of the ship, and then trying to find an\r\nanswer to the question.\"  And forthwith I proceeded to give a resume of\r\nthe cogitations which had ultimately led to my fixing the blame for the\r\naffair upon Bainbridge's shoulders.  In the course of my remarks I\r\nhappened to mention that at first I had been inclined to suspect the man\r\nnicknamed \"Welshy\", but that I had soon come to the conclusion that the\r\nfellow had not the brains necessary to plan such a _coup_ and carry it\r\nout to a successful conclusion in the masterly manner which had\r\ndistinguished the actual operation.\r\n\r\n\"Ah! but `Welshy' was in it, though,\" cut in the boatswain.  \"I know he\r\nwas; for he and Bainbridge was for ever gettin' away together by\r\ntheirselves and talkin' by the fathom.  `Welshy' is one of these here\r\nSocialist buckos who's got the notion that all hands ought to be on the\r\nsame level, and that nobody ought to have more of anything than anybody\r\nelse; he's a rare hand at preachin' about equality and the rights o'\r\nman, is `Welshy', and I wouldn't be a bit surprised if it turned out\r\nthat 'twas he as first give Mr Bainbridge the idee of seizin' the ship.\r\nAnd even if he wasn't, I know that he is pretty well mixed up in it,\r\nfor he was everlastin'ly yarnin' about the hardships and wrongs of\r\nsailormen, and throwin' out hints, like.  I didn't take no notice of 'em\r\nat the time--in fac' Chips and I used to argufy with and laugh at him;\r\nbut now, since this here mutiny job have happened, I seem to see that\r\nall his talk had a purpose, and that he was feelin' around, like, with\r\nthe idee of findin' out how many of us might be depended upon to back up\r\nhim and Bainbridge in the seizure of the ship.\"\r\n\r\n\"And it would appear that he was successful in winning over all hands\r\nexcept you three,\" remarked the skipper.  \"Did he ever attempt to sound\r\neither of you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ay, that he did, sir; lots o' times, now that I comes to think of it,\"\r\nanswered the boatswain.  \"But nothin' what you might call definite, you\r\nunderstand.  I s'pose he pretty soon saw that Chips and Sails and me\r\nweren't likely to have any truck wi' such an idee as mutiny and seizin'\r\nthe ship, so he soon knocked off talkin' to us about it.  I reckon that\r\nhe used to report to Bainbridge pretty often, tellin' him what he had\r\nsaid, and how we had took it; and I expect it was Mr B. who told him\r\nnot to say anything more to us about it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" agreed the skipper, \"I fancy you have got the hang of the thing\r\npretty accurately, bos'n; but it was a pity that it never occurred to\r\neither of you to mention the matter to me or Mr Bligh.  It would have\r\ngiven us a notion of what was brewing, and put us on our guard.\"\r\n\r\nBut Murdock, Parsons, and Simpson all vehemently protested that Lloyd's\r\nremarks were of so very general a character, and bore so striking a\r\nresemblance to the ordinary \"grousing\" universally met with in a ship's\r\nforecastle, which really means nothing, that it never occurred to either\r\nof them to attach any especial significance to what unfortunately had\r\nproved to be an exceptional case.  A great deal more was said upon the\r\nmatter before it was dropped; but the remarks were mostly of a desultory\r\ncharacter, and as they have no particular bearing upon the thread of\r\nthis story it is unnecessary to repeat them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TWO.\r\n\r\nTURNED ADRIFT.\r\n\r\nThe _Zenobia_ continued to run to the westward during the whole of that\r\nday before a wind that steadily softened down, hour after hour, until by\r\ntwo bells in the first dog-watch it was little more than a mere\r\nbreathing, scarcely strong enough to keep the heavy courses filled.  And\r\nwe could tell by the motion of the ship that the sea as well as the wind\r\nwas going down, for by the time that the above-named hour arrived we\r\nwere bowing and swaying upon the fast-subsiding swell as easily and\r\ngently as though the ship had been a cradle rocked by a mother's hand.\r\n\r\nThings had been tolerably quiet out on deck during the forenoon, but\r\nlater on, when the men had turned-to after their dinner, we heard sounds\r\noutside the house which indicated a considerable amount of activity on\r\nthe part of the mutineers; the booms and planks which were stowed on the\r\nroof of our prison were overhauled, and several of them were flung down\r\non deck; then \"Welshy\" came in and cast loose the carpenter, ordering\r\nhim to bring his chest of tools outside.  This was presently followed by\r\nthe sounds of sawing and hammering; later on we heard certain orders\r\nbeing given which indicated that the mast and yard tackles were being\r\nsent aloft; and finally there was a great commotion and laughing out on\r\ndeck, intermingled with the alarmed bleatings of some sheep, which were\r\nhoused in the longboat.\r\n\r\n\"Ah,\" ejaculated the skipper as these last-named sounds reached our\r\nears, \"I know what that means!  They are clearing out the longboat\r\npreparatory to getting her over the side, and mean to turn us adrift in\r\nher.  And not us only, but also the unfortunate passengers; for if they\r\nhad not intended to send them as well as ourselves away, they would have\r\nkept the longboat and given us one of the quarter boats, which would\r\nhave been amply big enough to have accommodated us seven--or six, if\r\nthey mean to keep Chips with them.\"\r\n\r\n\"He won't stay, sir, you may take my word for that,\" observed the\r\nboatswain.  \"Parsons is a straight chap--as straight as they make 'em;\r\nand you'll find that he's not the sort of man to have no truck wi'\r\nmutineers--not he!\"\r\n\r\n\"But they may compel him to stay,\" objected the skipper.  \"He would be a\r\nvery useful sort of man for them to have with them, and they may not\r\ngive him the choice of going or staying.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, that's very true,\" agreed Murdock.  \"But if they asks him to stay\r\nhe'll say `No', and likewise give 'em to understand that if they keep\r\nhim by force he won't do no work for 'em.  And they knows Chips, and\r\nunderstands that if he says a thing like that he'll stick to it, if it's\r\nonly to spite 'em.  No, I don't believe as they'll want to keep any man\r\nagainst his will, because that always means trouble, sooner or later,\r\nand Muster Bainbridge is far too 'cute to run the risk of anything of\r\nthat sort.  Besides, there's Joe Caton--he says as he sarved his time in\r\na shipbuilder's yard, and is as good a ship's carpenter as you'll find\r\ngoin'; he's stoppin' with 'em of his own accord, I reckon, and\r\nBainbridge will be satisfied with him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, perhaps it may be so; we shall soon know,\" agreed the skipper.\r\n\"But,\" he continued, with a sigh of anxiety, \"if they mean to turn the\r\npassengers as well as ourselves adrift--and I feel assured that they\r\ndo--I wish Bainbridge would let me advise him in the matter of fixing up\r\nthe longboat for the reception of the women and children.  They will\r\nneed many little comforts that an inexperienced lad, such as he is, will\r\nnever think of; and it will be bad enough for the poor souls, even if\r\neverything that is possible is done for their welfare.  And the longboat\r\nalone will not be big enough to take us all with any degree of safety,\r\nto say nothing of comfort.\"\r\n\r\n\"We must watch for an opportunity, and give him our views upon the\r\nmatter,\" said the chief mate.  \"I wonder whether--\"\r\n\r\nAt that moment the sliding door of the house in which we were confined\r\nwas thrust back, and Lloyd--otherwise \"Welshy\"--entered.  And behind\r\nhim, ranged up athwart the deck outside, were to be seen a number of the\r\nseamen, each with a rifle in his hand and a cutlass girt about his\r\nwaist.  It was evident that the mutineers had lost no time in hunting up\r\nthe ship's arm chest--at that time an almost obsolete item of a ship's\r\nequipment--and providing themselves with the means of effectually\r\nsuppressing anything in the nature of resistance on our part, or an\r\nattempt to recapture the ship.\r\n\r\n\"Good a'ternoon, gen'lemen,\" observed \"Welshy\", with a grin that might\r\nindicate either triumph or an attempt at ingratiation; \"splendid weather\r\nfor a boat trip, ain't it?  I'm come to cast yer loose, and I dare say\r\nye'll be much obliged to me--for it can't be very comfortable to sit\r\nthere, hour a'ter hour, with your feet lashed together and your hands\r\ntied behind your backs; but, ye see, we agreed as it was best to take no\r\nrisks, and then there'd be no call for bloodshed--I dare say you all\r\nunderstands what I means.  Yes,\"--as he proceeded to cast off the\r\nskipper's lashings--\"I've come to cast ye all adrift.  But let me warn\r\nye all not to dream of attemptin' anything foolish, for we've got the\r\nship and we means to keep her; and them rifles is all loaded with ball\r\ncartridge, and the men as carries 'em'll shoot to kill if e'er a one of\r\n'em sees any of you doin' what you didn't ought to do.  You understand,\r\nCap'n?  And you, Mr Mate?  And the rest of yer?\"\r\n\r\nAt these pointed questions we severally intimated that we understood,\r\nfor indeed we could do nothing else.  Whereupon the glowering scoundrel\r\nresumed:\r\n\r\n\"That's all right, and just as it should be.  We ain't none of us got\r\nnothin' against e'er a one of yer, and we don't want to have no\r\nvi'lence, if it can be helped--and there won't be none onless you\r\nyourselves brings it about.  But if you does--well, stand clear, that's\r\nall I got to say.  Now, we bein' all agreed that we don't want no\r\nvi'lence nor bloodshed nor nothin' in any ways disagreeable, and also\r\nbein' agreed that we prefers to have this here ship all to our own\r\nselves, it have been decided to send you gents, and the ladies and\r\ngen'lemen aft, away in the longboat, to go just exac'ly where you\r\nbloomin' well likes.  There's twenty-eight of yer, all told, includin'\r\nthe women and kids; and the longboat'll just comfortably hold yer all,\r\nwith provisions and water for three weeks.  Our new skipper, Cap'n\r\nBainbridge, says that in this weather, and wi' this purty little breeze,\r\nyou ought to be able to make the South American coast in ten days,\r\neasy.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ten days!\" exploded the skipper.  \"Yes, no doubt--if this wind holds\r\nand the fine weather lasts.  But suppose that it doesn't, what then?\"\r\nHe pulled himself up short, panting and breathless with anger, got a\r\npull upon himself, recovered his self-control, and then said, in a\r\nperfectly quiet and steady voice:\r\n\r\n\"Look here, Lloyd, you are a seaman of experience, and ought to\r\nunderstand--and do understand, I have no doubt--that to send a heavily\r\nloaded open boat away upon a ten days' voyage with only three weeks'\r\nprovisions and water is--well--practically downright murder.  I must see\r\nyour--er--Mr Bainbridge about this, I really must; and you must arrange\r\nthat I have an opportunity to do so.  I cannot and will not undertake\r\nthe responsibility of such a voyage as that which is proposed, nor, I am\r\nsure, will Mr Bligh or Mr Johnson.  I shall simply refuse to go in the\r\nboat.\"\r\n\r\n\"And I too,\" added the chief mate.\r\n\r\n\"Ditto,\" tersely added Johnson.\r\n\r\n\"You'll refuse to go, eh?\" snarled Lloyd.  \"And suppose we makes yer;\r\nsuppose--\"\r\n\r\n\"There is no use in supposing anything,\" interrupted the skipper.  \"You\r\nprofess to be anxious to avoid anything in the nature of force or\r\nbloodshed.  Very well; I tell you that there will be both if you\r\nscoundrels persist in turning us all adrift under such circumstances as\r\nyou have named.  No, stand back; don't attempt violence with me, my fine\r\nfellow.  I am free now, and if you dare to lay your filthy hands upon me\r\nI will kill you with this,\" and he shook his clenched fist savagely in\r\nLloyd's face.  \"Now,\" he continued authoritatively, \"go aft and tell\r\nBainbridge that I want to see him--that I must and will speak to him\r\nbefore I leave this ship.\"\r\n\r\nTo my great surprise the man obediently turned away, and, with a\r\nlow-spoken word or two to the armed men who remained on guard outside\r\nthe door, swung round the end of the house and walked aft, as we could\r\ntell by the sound of his receding footsteps.\r\n\r\nHe was absent about a quarter of an hour, during which Captain Roberts\r\nquietly cast off the chief mate's lashings, then the pair of them\r\nreleased Mr Johnson and the boatswain, who in turn released the\r\nsailmaker and myself, all being done under the eyes of the armed guard\r\nbefore the door, who looked stolidly on without protest by word or deed.\r\nWe had scarcely done this when we became aware that the ship was being\r\nbrought to the wind; and presently the order was given to man the\r\nbraces.  There were the usual \"Yo-ho! yo-hip! round with her, boys!\" and\r\nthe like cries, which the British merchant seaman deems it necessary to\r\nindulge in when he is pulling and hauling; and presently we understood\r\nthat the ship was hove-to on the starboard tack, with her head to the\r\nnorthward.  Then the order was given to man the capstan; and the men\r\nwere heaving round when Lloyd returned, and, with a grin of\r\ncomprehension at finding us all released from our bonds, informed the\r\nskipper that Bainbridge was willing to see him.  Whereupon Captain\r\nRoberts left us, and, escorted by \"Welshy\", went aft.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, we who were left behind in the forward house gathered from\r\nthe various sounds which reached us that the longboat was now being\r\nhoisted out; and presently we heard the heavy splash of her as she was\r\ndropped into the water alongside.  This was followed by an order to\r\noverhaul and unhook the yard tackles; and in the comparative silence\r\nthat then ensued we occasionally caught the alternate murmur of the\r\nskipper's and Bainbridge's voices: but they were speaking in ordinary\r\nconversational tones, and the multitudinous sounds of the ship--the\r\nfaint rustle of canvas aloft, the patter of reef-points, the creaking of\r\nthe yards and timbers, the wash of water alongside, and the subdued hum\r\nof many voices on deck--prevented us from catching a word of what was\r\nbeing said.  However, we gathered that Captain Roberts had been\r\nprotesting against turning so many people adrift in the longboat alone,\r\nfor presently we heard Bainbridge shout an order to lower away the\r\ncaptain's gig, which, next to the dinghy and jollyboat, was the smallest\r\nboat belonging to the ship.  But she was roomy enough to accommodate ten\r\npeople comfortably, without ballast, or seven with provisions and water\r\nenough to last her crew for three weeks; and I considered that if\r\nBainbridge was indeed going to give us the gig as well as the longboat,\r\nwith, of course, an adequate supply of provisions and water, we should\r\nbe able to manage tolerably well in anything short of a gale.\r\n\r\nPresently Lloyd, who appeared to be acting as Bainbridge's lieutenant,\r\ncame forward again and entered the house.  \"Now, then, gen'lemen,\" he\r\nremarked, with the grin which he seemed to think it necessary to assume\r\nwhen addressing us, \"the longboat's all ready, and the passengers is\r\nwaitin' to go down into her, so you'd better come along and see to the\r\nstowin' of 'em.  And Mr Bainbridge have agreed to let you have the gig\r\nalso; so you ought to be as happy and comfortable as sandboys.  But\r\ndon't forget what I told yer about our not wantin' to have no trouble\r\nnor bloodshed.  The ship's ours, and we means to keep her, so if you\r\nwants to go away with whole skins, what you've got to do is to get from\r\nalongside as quick as possible, and without makin' no trouble; for as\r\nsure as any of ye attempts to make trouble there'll be bloodshed, and\r\ndon't you forget it.  Mr Bligh, you and Mr Johnson be to go first and\r\nsee to the stowin' of the passengers; and when the longboat's got her\r\ncomplement the rest of yer can foller.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are not taking any chances, Lloyd, are you?\" laughed Mr Bligh\r\nsarcastically, as he rose to his feet.  \"Although all hands of you\r\nappear to be armed, you are not going to run the risk of having too many\r\nof us loose out on deck at once, for fear of what we might do, eh?\r\nWell, you are a fine, courageous lot of mutineers, I must say!  You\r\nwouldn't even chance a fight with a single one of us when you started\r\nout to take the ship, but must needs entice us for'ard, one man at a\r\ntime, upon the pretence that fire had broken out in the hold.  Ugh!  I\r\ndon't envy Bainbridge his crew of bold buccaneers--not a little bit!\"\r\nand with a scornful laugh he swaggered out on deck, followed by the\r\nsecond mate.\r\n\r\nA minute later we heard his voice speaking to the passengers and calling\r\nupon them by name, one by one, to pass down the side, the women and\r\nchildren first.  And it was pitiful to hear the low moaning and sobbing\r\nof some of the poor creatures as they reluctantly left the firm,\r\nspacious deck of the ship and fearfully clambered down the side ladder\r\ninto the dancing longboat, which looked so small and dangerous a refuge\r\nin comparison with the bulk of the barque.  The embarkation of the\r\npassengers proceeded slowly, because of the women and children among\r\nthem, all of whom were frightened, while many of them were weeping\r\nbitterly, despite the best efforts of husbands, fathers, brothers, and\r\nmale friends to encourage them.  But at length the last passenger went\r\ndown over the side and was assigned his place in the longboat, and then\r\nLloyd again came forward and summoned those of us who remained in the\r\nhouse to follow him; and as we passed out on deck and started to walk\r\naft to the gangway, the five armed seamen who had mounted guard over us\r\nfollowed at our heels.\r\n\r\nAs we cleared the galley, which formed part of the structure in which we\r\nhad all been confined, the whole of the after part of the ship, from the\r\nfore end of the main hatchway, came into view, and we saw that the\r\nvessel was indeed, as we had supposed, hove-to on the starboard tack,\r\nwith her mainyard laid almost square, the mainsail brailed up, and the\r\nremainder of her canvas set; and the fabric was full of the sound of a\r\ngentle creaking of timbers, trusses, and parrals, and the soft rustling\r\nof the white cloths overhead.  She had no way on her, but was curtsying\r\nand rolling gently on a long, sluggish swell that came creeping up from\r\nthe eastward.  Apart from the swell, the sea was quite smooth, its\r\nsurface being scarcely wrinkled into a pure, delicate blue tint by the\r\neasterly breeze, which had died down to so gentle a zephyr, that the\r\nlighter canvas and even the topsails flapped to the masts with every\r\nheave and dip of the hull.  The sky was cloudless, save away down toward\r\nthe west, where a great mass of vapour, broken up into small patches,\r\nblazed crimson and gold in the rays of the declining sun, and gilded and\r\nreddened the sleepy undulations beneath it.\r\n\r\nBainbridge, with his peaked cap thrust aggressively to the back of his\r\nhead, his brass-buttoned blue serge jacket opening to display his white\r\nshirt and flowing black silk necktie, and also, incidentally, a brace of\r\nrevolvers, suggestively stuck in the broad elastic belt which girt his\r\nwaist, and with a smile of insolent triumph upon his dark, saturnine,\r\nbut otherwise rather good-looking face, stood alone at the break of the\r\npoop, with both hands thrust deep into his trousers pockets and his\r\nwhite-canvas-shod feet planted wide apart, watchfully regarding the\r\nproceedings on the main deck beneath him; while the whole of the crew,\r\nwith the exception of the cook and the five men who constituted our\r\nespecial bodyguard, were drawn up athwart the deck and along the face of\r\nthe poop structure, each man armed with a rifle, and with a sheathed\r\ncutlass girt about his waist.  Captain Roberts and Mr Bligh stood\r\ntogether at the open lee gangway, through which and above the lee rail\r\ncould be seen the tossing masts of the longboat.\r\n\r\nAs our little party approached him the skipper turned, and, after\r\nrunning his eye over us for a moment, said:\r\n\r\n\"Mr Temple, I shall be obliged to ask you, the carpenter, and Sails to\r\ngo with Mr Johnson in the gig.  The longboat is already pretty well\r\ncrowded, considering that part of her complement consists of women and\r\nchildren.  You will find that the gig already has four breakers of fresh\r\nwater in her, which will serve for ballast, but you will have to\r\nprovision her from the longboat, as Bainbridge absolutely refuses to\r\ngive us so much as another biscuit.  You will find Mr Johnson already\r\nin her.  Just jump down and lend him a hand, if you please.\"\r\n\r\nThe gig, with her mast already stepped, was lying outside the longboat,\r\nwith Mr Johnson in her, while Chips, in the longboat, was overhauling\r\nthe stock of provisions in the latter and passing a certain portion into\r\nthe gig according to the second mate's instructions.  It was a bit of a\r\njob to get to her across the crowded longboat, but I had just stepped\r\ninto her and was about to address Johnson when I stopped short, for I\r\nheard Captain Roberts's voice raised in a final appeal to the men.\r\n\r\n\"My lads,\" he said in a loud, clear voice, \"before I quit the ship I\r\nwant to give you a last chance to undo the evil that you have this day\r\ndone, and to avert from yourselves the punishment that most surely\r\nawaits you if you persist in following the path into which you have been\r\nbeguiled by a plausible young scoundrel--\"\r\n\r\n\"Meaning me, eh, Skipper?\" jeered Bainbridge, with a harsh laugh, from\r\nthe poop above.\r\n\r\n\"Even now, men,\" continued the captain, ignoring Bainbridge's\r\ninterruption, \"at this last moment, it is not too late for you to\r\nwithdraw from your unholy compact and return to your duty.  You are not\r\nto blame for what has happened; you have simply been deceived and led\r\nastray by one who ought to have known better than to tempt you to a step\r\nwhich can only end in your destruction.  I ask you to lay down those\r\narms and place yourselves at my mercy; and I promise you, upon my honour\r\nas a seaman and a gentleman, that if you will do so not one of you\r\nexcept your ringleader shall ever hear another word about the matter--\"\r\n\r\n\"Stop!  Shut up!  Not another word, as you value your life!\" yelled\r\nBainbridge, suddenly flying into a fury and whipping a revolver out of\r\nhis belt.  \"So that is your little game, is it?  You would bribe those\r\nmen to betray me, to put me into your power!  Very well!  Now you jump\r\ndown into that longboat at once; and if you dare to open your mouth\r\nagain and speak another word of temptation to the men, I'll blow your\r\nhead off,\" and he wound up with an oath.\r\n\r\nBut Captain Roberts was not to be deterred so easily from seizing the\r\nonly opportunity that had thus far presented itself by which he might\r\nmake an effort to regain the command of the ship and his ascendancy over\r\nher crew, nor was he at all the sort of man to be frightened from his\r\nduty by the flourishing of a pistol before his eyes.  It was his duty to\r\nnullify this mutiny if he could, and therefore he turned to the men\r\nagain.\r\n\r\n\"Lads,\" he said, \"bethink yourselves.  What sort of a future is to be\r\nyours if you persist--?\"\r\n\r\nCrack!  Bainbridge's pistol barked out from the poop, and poor Captain\r\nRoberts reeled back, clutching his breast, from which the red blood was\r\nspouting, into the arms of Mr Bligh, who was standing close by him.\r\nAnd Bainbridge, startled perhaps at what he had done--for the skipper\r\nhad always behaved like a father to him--lost the last vestige of his\r\nself-control, and became in a moment the very personification of a\r\nraving, bloodthirsty maniac.  Levelling his still smoking revolver at\r\nBligh, he commanded the latter, with a very tornado of curses, instantly\r\nto place the body of the captain in the longboat and shove off from the\r\nship's side forthwith, unless he wished to share the skipper's fate.\r\n\r\nStill supporting the swooning body of the captain in his arms, Bligh\r\nallowed his gaze to search in turn the face of each of the armed men who\r\nnow clustered round him, and seeing nothing to justify the hope that a\r\nfurther appeal would meet with the least success, replied:\r\n\r\n\"All right, my lad, I'm going--worse luck for you!  Here, one of you,\"--\r\nto the crew--\"just drop your shooting-iron for a minute, if you're not\r\nafraid of me, and lend me a hand to lower the skipper over the side,\r\nwill ye?\"  Then, as one of the men mechanically obeyed, the mate\r\nmurmured in his ear: \"I'm sorry for you silly buckos, for this means the\r\nhang-man's noose for all hands of you.  But there's time for you yet.\r\nIf you repent before we're out of sight, all you have to do is to bear\r\nup in chase of us and run the ensign up to the fore royal-mast-head.  I\r\nshall know what that means, and you'll have no reason to regret it.  Now\r\nthen,\" aloud, as the two took the skipper's body between them,\r\n\"handsomely does it.  Below there, boatswain, just ease the captain\r\ndown, and lay him in the main sheets where the doctor can get to work\r\nupon him.\"\r\n\r\nBetween them they somehow contrived to get the unfortunate skipper's\r\nbody down the side and into the sternsheets of the longboat, where Dr\r\nMorrison at once proceeded to examine the wound; and the moment that\r\nthis was done Mr Bligh scrambled down the side ladder, made his way aft\r\namong the women and children, who were huddled together, most of them\r\nsobbing quietly with their faces buried in their hands, seized the\r\ntiller, and, thrusting it hard-over, gave the word to shove off and make\r\nsail.  The order was promptly obeyed, and five minutes later the\r\nlongboat, with the gig towing astern, was running off to leeward, with\r\nboth standing lugs and her jib set; while those of us who were watching\r\nthe barque saw her head sheets trimmed aft and her mainyard swung as she\r\nslowly gathered way and stood to the nor'ard and eastward, close-hauled\r\non the starboard tack.\r\n\r\nWe had been under way about ten minutes when Mr Bligh hailed Mr\r\nJohnson to haul up alongside; and when we had done so he said:\r\n\r\n\"Mr Johnson, now that Captain Roberts is so seriously hurt I shall want\r\nyou to come into the longboat with me, because I am the only one at\r\npresent capable of navigating her, and--you understand me, I'm sure.\r\nTemple, you will have to take command of the gig, and do the best you\r\ncan with her.  That young scoundrel has not permitted any of us to bring\r\nour sextants with us; he has not even given us a chart, or so much as a\r\nboat compass, so we shall have to do the best we can without them.  But\r\nI have been considering the situation, and have come to the conclusion\r\nthat our best plan will be to make for Rio, which, according to my rough\r\nreckoning, bears about west and by no'th, true; distant, say, twelve\r\nhundred miles: and we shall have to shape our course for it, as nearly\r\nas we can, by the sun and stars.  This plan has the advantage that by\r\ncontinuing to steer a westerly course we are bound to hit the South\r\nAmerican coast somewhere, even if we should miss Rio; and we also stand\r\na very good chance of falling in with and being picked up by something\r\nbound round the Horn.  So much for that part of the business.  Next, as\r\nwe are a bit crowded here, and the boat is rather deeper than I like,\r\nyou will have to take the boatswain in exchange for Mr Johnson; and--\"\r\nhe paused and ran his eye speculatively over the crowd in the longboat.\r\nThen, addressing them generally, he said, \"I wonder whether one of you\r\ngentlemen would care to go in the gig with Mr Temple?  As you can all\r\nsee and feel for yourselves, we are rather uncomfortably crowded aboard\r\nhere, and the boat would be all the safer if she were relieved of the\r\nweight of even one of you, while there is plenty of room in the gig, and\r\nshe is just as safe as the longboat.  I suppose I need not tell you that\r\nTemple is an excellent seaman and navigator, while the gig is the faster\r\nboat of the two and will probably arrive at least a couple of days ahead\r\nof us.\"\r\n\r\nA pause of a few seconds' duration followed this appeal, and then a Mr\r\nCunningham--who happened to be the only unattached male passenger among\r\nthe party--arose and said:\r\n\r\n\"If you consider the change desirable I shall be very pleased to go in\r\nthe gig; in fact, I am the only male passenger who has no `encumbrance'\r\nwith him in the shape of wife or child, therefore it will make no\r\ndifference at all to me which boat I happen to be in.\"\r\n\r\n\"That being the case, we will make the exchange at once, and then you,\r\nTemple, had better make sail and get over the ground as fast as you\r\ncan,\" said Mr Bligh.\r\n\r\nAnd therewith the gig was hauled up close alongside the longboat and the\r\ntransfer at once effected, Mr Johnson turning over to the bigger boat\r\nwhile the boatswain and Mr Cunningham joined us in the gig.  The\r\ntransfer was not a lengthy process, for Bainbridge had not permitted any\r\nof us to bring away any of our belongings, and at that moment the\r\nrichest of us had only what he or she happened to be wearing in the way\r\nof clothing.  Then, as the chief mate cast off our painter and thrust\r\nthe two boats apart, he said:\r\n\r\n\"Make sail, Temple, and crack on for all you are worth.  And, as soon as\r\nyou get in, report the mutiny, get the British Consul to send out a tug\r\nor something, with provisions and water, to look for us; and see that he\r\nreports the matter at once to the nearest naval station within reach, so\r\nthat the men-o'-war may be dispatched to seek the _Zenobia_, and get\r\nhold of her before she has time to do very much mischief.  And don't\r\nforget that your course is west and by no'th--or, as near as may be, in\r\nthe eye of the setting sun when he reaches the horizon.  Goodbye, and a\r\nquick passage to you!\"\r\n\r\n\"Goodbye, sir,\" I returned; \"and the same to you!  I trust that the\r\ndoctor will be able to put the captain on his feet again by the time\r\nthat you get in.  I will remember all your instructions, and lose not a\r\nmoment in carrying them out directly we arrive.  Goodbye, all!  Hoist\r\naway, bos'n; and, Simpson, boom out the sheet with that boathook.\"\r\n\r\nThe sun was by this time within ten minutes of his setting, and glowed,\r\na great, palpitating disk of incandescent red, through a thin veil of\r\ninnumerable small, closely clustering clouds that stretched in gorgeous\r\ntints of gold, crimson, and purple against a background of very pale\r\ngreen, right athwart the horizon ahead, their colours being brilliantly\r\nreflected in the softly rippling, slowly moving undulations that came\r\ncreeping up after us, heaving us gently up on their ample breasts and\r\nthen sweeping on ahead of us straight toward the sinking luminary.  The\r\nwind had just strength enough in it to keep the sheet of our single lug\r\nfrom sagging into the water, and the gig was sliding smoothly along,\r\nwith the small sound of lapping, gurgling water under her, at the rate\r\nof about three knots in the hour, leaving behind her a thin, swirling\r\nwake of small bubbles and tiny whirlpools that vanished upon the breast\r\nof the next on-coming swell.  The longboat, under fore and main standing\r\nlugs and a small jib, deeply loaded as she was, was doing a knot less\r\nthan ourselves, and we soon passed and slid ahead of her; while away\r\ndown in the north-eastern board, broad on our starboard quarter, the\r\ntopsails and upper canvas of the barque shone primrose-yellow above the\r\nridges of the swell as she stood away from us, heading about\r\nnor'-north-east, close-hauled on the starboard tack.\r\n\r\nThere was every prospect that we were about to have a fine night, almost\r\ntoo fine, in fact, to suit us: for although light winds meant smooth\r\nwater, which in its turn meant safety for deeply laden open boats, we\r\nhad a long road before us and not too many provisions or too much water\r\nfor our sustenance during our journey; and for my own part, if I could\r\nhave had my choice, I would have preferred a little more wind, provided\r\nthat it was fair--even although it involved a somewhat heavier sea--to\r\nhelp us on our way.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THREE.\r\n\r\nWE START OUR VOYAGE IN THE GIG.\r\n\r\nThe first matter to which I gave consideration, after we were fairly\r\nunder way, and had parted company with the longboat, was that of food\r\nand drink; and I began by taking stock roughly of what we had, and\r\njotting down the items in my pocket-book.  To begin with, we had four\r\nfive-gallon breakers of fresh water--twenty gallons in all.  Then we had\r\ntwo sacks of cabin bread, which, by a partial count, I estimated to\r\ncontain about three hundred biscuits altogether.  And in addition to\r\nthese we had one dozen tins of ox tongue; six small tins of potted\r\nmeats; four jars of marmalade and two of jam; two bottles of pickles;\r\nfour bottles of lime juice; one bottle of brandy; and two bottles of\r\nrum.  When I had jotted everything down I made a few calculations, and\r\nthen I spoke.\r\n\r\n\"Shipmates,\" I said,--\"and I include you, Mr Cunningham, in the term,\r\nfor this misfortune puts us all upon the same footing--you no doubt\r\nheard Mr Bligh say, a little while ago, that according to his reckoning\r\nwe are somewhere about twelve hundred miles from Rio, which is our\r\nnearest port.  That means a twelve days' voyage, with a fair wind all\r\nthe time, blowing fresh enough to keep us going, hour after hour, at the\r\nrate of five knots.  Now, those of us who have used the sea don't need\r\nto be told that such a favourable condition of affairs is so exceedingly\r\nunlikely that it is scarcely worth talking about.  To begin with, we are\r\nmaking a bad start, for instead of doing our five knots we are doing\r\nlittle if anything more than half that, with every prospect of a flat\r\ncalm within the next three or four hours.  Therefore I think it will be\r\nwise of us to recognise, at the outset, that our voyage is a good deal\r\nmore likely to take twenty days than it is to be accomplished in ten.\r\n\r\n\"Of course, in saying this I am regarding the matter from its most\r\nunfavourable point of view.  I remember that we have had easterly winds\r\nwithout a break ever since we crossed the line, and it may be that the\r\nTrades are extending unusually far south just now, and that we are still\r\non the southerly fringe of them.  If this should prove to be the case we\r\nshall be all right, for by steering a west and by no'th course we shall\r\nbe edging to the nor'ard and working our way back into the permanent\r\ntrade winds.  But, on the other hand, this easterly wind may not be the\r\ntrade wind at all--and my own opinion is that it is not--in which case\r\nwe may expect a westerly breeze--that is to say, a foul wind--at any\r\nmoment; and I think we should only be acting with common prudence to\r\ntake such a probability into consideration.\r\n\r\n\"Now, this brings me to the question of food and water.  As you have\r\nseen, I have been taking stock of what we have, and making a few\r\ncalculations, with the following result.  First, with regard to the\r\nfresh water.  We have just twenty gallons of it, or one hundred and\r\nsixty pints.  If we could be certain of making our voyage in ten days\r\nthat amount of water would afford sixteen pints per day to be equally\r\ndivided between the five of us, which is a fraction over three pints per\r\nday per man, or, say, half a pint at each of three meals and another\r\nhalf-pint at three intervals between meals.  Little enough, you will\r\nsay.  Very true; yet I think we must endeavour to do with less.  We must\r\ntry to be satisfied with four half-pints per day of twenty-four hours\r\nper man, by which means we shall be able to make our water last sixteen\r\ndays, and in sixteen days many things may happen: we may end our voyage,\r\nif we have luck; or we may be picked up; or we may have rain enough to\r\nenable us to replenish our water supply.  But since neither of these\r\nthings may happen, we ought, in common prudence, to determine at the\r\noutset not to drink more than four half-pints per man per day; and I\r\nthink we may be able to manage upon that without any very great\r\nhardship.  What say you?\"\r\n\r\n\"I think we can manage it, if we set our minds to do it,\" at once\r\nanswered Mr Cunningham, and after a little further talk the boatswain,\r\ncarpenter, and sailmaker also agreed to make the attempt.  In the same\r\nway we arrived at a determination to be satisfied with four biscuits per\r\nday each, with a suitable proportion of tongue, potted meat, jam, and\r\nwhat not; and we also agreed upon the quantity of spirits which was to\r\nconstitute each man's daily allowance, Cunningham being of opinion that\r\na very small allowance of stimulant would be almost a necessity, seeing\r\nthat our food was to be so restricted in quantity.  And then, having\r\nsettled this important question, we piped to supper, each man receiving\r\nthe exact quantity of food agreed upon; and when we had finished we were\r\nall of the one opinion, namely, that although our appetites were far\r\nfrom being satisfied, it would be quite possible for us to sustain life\r\nunder such conditions for a fortnight or three weeks without serious\r\ndeterioration of either health or strength.\r\n\r\nBy the time supper was over it had fallen dark, and we had lost sight of\r\nboth the longboat and the barque.  It was a magnificent night, the sky a\r\ndeep indigo cloudless blue, studded with myriads of stars, the water\r\nperfectly smooth, save for the long, low undulations of the swell; and\r\nthe only fault that I had to find with the weather was that there was\r\ntoo little wind, the breeze having died down until we were making\r\nscarcely two knots in the hour.  Fortunately we had no difficulty in the\r\nmatter of determining our course, for it happened that Mr Cunningham\r\nwore a small compass attached to his watch chain as a charm; and after I\r\nhad made the necessary allowance for variation we soon managed, with the\r\nassistance of this miniature compass and a match, to pick upon a star\r\nlow down on the horizon by which we could steer a fairly straight course\r\nfor at least a couple of hours, at the expiration of which it would, of\r\ncourse, be easy to pick another.\r\n\r\nThen we arranged the matter of watches.  There were four of us in the\r\nboat who were sailors, and my first proposal was that each of us should\r\ntake a watch of three hours; but Mr Cunningham would not hear of this.\r\nHe was, it appeared, a civil engineer by profession, but he had a\r\nnatural love of the sea and all matters pertaining to sea life, and was\r\nquite an enthusiastic amateur yachtsman, with a sufficient knowledge of\r\nthe way to handle a boat to justify me fully in entrusting him with\r\ntemporary charge of the gig, at least in fine weather; and he insisted\r\non taking his fair share of whatever work there might be to do.  We\r\ntherefore decided that he also should be allowed to stand a watch.  I\r\nundertook to stand the first watch, from six o'clock to nine; and, this\r\nbeing arranged, the boatswain, carpenter, and sailmaker at once disposed\r\nthemselves for sleep, two upon the thwarts and the third coiled up in\r\nthe eyes of the boat, while Cunningham, who declared that he had no\r\ninclination for sleep, placed himself beside me in the sternsheets and\r\nbegan to chat in a low tone of voice, so that he might not disturb the\r\nothers.\r\n\r\nNaturally the subject uppermost in our minds was the mutiny, and we\r\nbegan to talk about it.  I happened to express some surprise that\r\nBainbridge had allowed the doctor to leave the ship, upon which\r\nCunningham gave vent to a low chuckle of amusement.\r\n\r\n\"My dear chap,\" he said, \"Bainbridge didn't dare to keep him.  He fully\r\nintended to do so at first, and acquainted Morrison with the fact, but\r\nthe doctor wouldn't have it at any price--swore that if he were not\r\nallowed to leave with the rest of us he would poison all hands within a\r\nweek!  After that, Bainbridge was only too glad to let him go.\"\r\n\r\nWe continued to chat for some time upon the subject, wondering what\r\npossible motive Bainbridge could have for proceeding to such an extreme\r\nas that of capturing the ship; by what means he had contrived to win the\r\nmen over; and how he had managed to do it without exciting the slightest\r\nsuspicion, and so on: and then Cunningham began to speak of himself.  He\r\nwas, it appeared, an orphan, twenty-eight years of age, without a single\r\nfriend in the world who felt enough interest in him to care what might\r\nbecome of him.  He had already explained, a little earlier in the\r\nevening, that he was by profession a civil engineer; and he now went on\r\nto tell me that, entirely without friends or influence as he was, he had\r\nfound it so difficult to make headway in England that he had at last\r\ndetermined upon going out to Natal, in which colony, it being\r\ncomparatively speaking a new country, he had hoped to find some scope\r\nfor his professional knowledge.  \"But that,\" he added, \"is all knocked\r\non the head by that young villain, Bainbridge, who has not only\r\nprevented me from reaching Natal, but has actually turned me adrift in\r\nan open boat to fetch up who knows where, with only the clothes I stand\r\nin.  And yet, not exactly that either,\" he corrected himself with a\r\nquiet chuckle of amusement; \"for although my expensive surveying\r\ninstruments and all my kit are on board the _Zenobia_, I contrived to\r\nget at my trunks this morning and extract therefrom a bag containing one\r\nhundred and forty sovereigns, as well as my telescope and half a dozen\r\nsticks of tobacco, all of which I carefully secreted about my person and\r\nhave with me now.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" returned I, \"if that is the case you may call yourself lucky,\r\nfor you will find a hundred and forty British sovereigns exceedingly\r\nuseful when we get ashore; as for your telescope, it may prove of the\r\nutmost value to us before this trip is over.  You are considerably\r\nbetter off than I am, for I was allowed to leave the ship with literally\r\nonly the clothes that I am wearing.  The remainder of my clothes,\r\ntogether with my sextant, nautical and other books, and some sixteen\r\npounds odd in cash, are still in my berth aboard the barque, if that\r\nswab has not already seized them.  But of course I am hoping to find a\r\nship at Rio, aboard which I may be able to work my passage home; and\r\nonce back in London the owners are bound to find me another berth.\"\r\n\r\n\"But supposing there shouldn't happen to be a ship at Rio in which you\r\ncan work your passage home.  What will you do in that case?\" asked\r\nCunningham.\r\n\r\n\"Oh,\" I said, \"I should simply have to take the first berth I could\r\nfind, irrespective of where the vessel might happen to be bound for!\r\nOr, in the last resort, I can place myself in the hands of the British\r\nConsul, and be sent home as a shipwrecked seaman.\"\r\n\r\n\"I see,\" said Cunningham thoughtfully.  \"But,\" he resumed, after a\r\nmoment's silence, \"there is no need for you to adopt either of these\r\ncourses, you know, old chap.  My hundred and forty sovereigns will be\r\nquite sufficient to see us both comfortably home from Rio, and you can\r\nrepay me whenever you happen to be able.\"\r\n\r\nI very heartily thanked the young civil engineer for his exceedingly\r\ngenerous offer, but protested that I could not possibly accept it--that,\r\nin fact, there was not the least likelihood that things would turn out\r\nso badly in Rio as to compel me to avail myself of his generosity; but\r\nnothing would satisfy my companion short of a definite promise that I\r\nwould accept his help should matters result awkwardly upon our arrival.\r\nEventually I very reluctantly yielded to his importunities and gave him\r\nthe required promise, and thus began a sincere friendship between us\r\nthat was only further strengthened by the long series of remarkable\r\nadventures that lay ahead of us both, although at that moment we little\r\ndreamed that anything out of the ordinary run of events was to befall\r\neither of us.\r\n\r\nToward the end of my watch the breeze evinced a slight tendency to\r\nfreshen, and when at nine o'clock I handed over the charge of the boat\r\nto the boatswain, and Cunningham and I disposed ourselves to secure such\r\nsleep as might come to us, we were slipping along through the water at\r\nthe rate of a good honest four knots in the hour.\r\n\r\nAs may be imagined, my sleep that night was of a somewhat intermittent\r\ncharacter, for a boat's thwart is not the most comfortable bed in the\r\nworld, and I was fully conscious of the responsibility that had been\r\nlaid upon me to guide the gig, and the lives which had been entrusted to\r\nher, over the trackless ocean, without the aid of chart or nautical\r\ninstruments of any kind save the toy compass attached to Cunningham's\r\nwatch chain.  I was well aware that my only hope of success lay in the\r\nkeeping of the most accurate account possible of the boat's progress and\r\ndirection, and, therefore, was up and looking about me at least half a\r\ndozen times during the night.\r\n\r\nThe fine weather continued all through the hours of darkness, and during\r\nthe boatswain's and carpenter's watches the wind gradually freshened up,\r\nuntil by three o'clock, when Chips called the sailmaker to relieve him,\r\nthe boat was buzzing merrily along at a speed of between six and seven\r\nknots; but after that the wind began to soften rapidly away again, until\r\nat length, when the sun swept into view above the eastern horizon, we\r\nscarcely had steerage way, and half an hour later it fell a flat calm.\r\nWe accordingly lowered the sail, and, this done, I directed Simpson, the\r\nsailmaker--who was the lightest of us, and therefore the least likely to\r\ncapsize the boat--to shin up to the masthead and see if he could detect\r\nany sign of the longboat or the barque, and incidentally take a good\r\nlook round the entire horizon upon the off-chance of there being a sail\r\nanywhere in sight; but he reported the horizon bare in every direction\r\nexcept in the eastern board, where he fancied he could occasionally\r\ndetect a faint something that might possibly be the sails of the\r\nlongboat, although he was by no means sure even as to that, opining that\r\nwhat he had seen, if indeed he had seen anything at all, might be the\r\ndistant fin of a prowling shark.\r\n\r\nThe mention of sharks gave me an idea, and I asked my companions whether\r\nperchance any of them happened to have any small stuff about them out of\r\nwhich we might contrive to make a fishing line; whereupon Chips, with a\r\nsmile, requested me to vacate my seat in the sternsheets for a moment,\r\nand, opening the locker in the after thwart of the boat, produced an\r\nexcellent cod line, with hooks and sinker all complete, explaining that\r\nas soon as he gathered an inkling of what Bainbridge intended on the\r\nprevious day, he contrived, while engaged in knocking up a temporary pen\r\nfor the sheep, to filch the said line out of the cook's galley and to\r\nsecrete it, afterward seizing an opportunity to transfer it to the gig's\r\nlocker when he learned that she was about to be turned over to us.\r\nThere happened to be a piece of dry shrivelled bait still transfixed\r\nupon one of the hooks; we therefore dropped it over the side, paid out\r\nthe line, made fast the inner end to one of the thwarts, and forthwith\r\nforgot all about it in the small bustle of getting breakfast.\r\n\r\nBut while we were still engaged upon the meal we suddenly became aware\r\nthat our fishing line was being violently agitated, and upon hauling it\r\nin found that we had been fortunate enough to hook a young dolphin about\r\ntwo feet long.  Now, raw dolphin is not exactly an appetising dish,\r\nespecially to those who, like ourselves, possessed nothing keener than a\r\nreally strong, healthy hunger; still, there was the fish, so much to the\r\ngood as supplementary to our rather meagre breakfast allowance, and--\r\nwell, in short we--at least the boatswain, carpenter, sailmaker, and\r\nmyself--managed to eat nearly half of him.  Cunningham had not yet\r\narrived at the starvation-point where raw fish could be devoured with a\r\nrelish, and he declined to share our banquet, for which I did not blame\r\nhim; but really, after I had succeeded in so far conquering my prejudice\r\nagainst raw food as to nibble cautiously at my portion, I found that it\r\nwas by no means so repulsive as I had imagined.  And although it was\r\ncertainly not at all inviting it was undoubtedly nutritious; and when at\r\nlength I finished my breakfast, not only was my hunger completely\r\nsatisfied, but I felt refreshed and invigorated after my meal.\r\n\r\nBreakfast disposed of, Simpson once more shinned aloft and took another\r\nlook round; but there was still nothing in sight--indeed, how should\r\nthere be, seeing that there was no wind to fan anything into our ken?\r\nHe could not now even discern the faint appearance to the eastward which\r\nhe had imagined might indicate the position of the longboat, but that of\r\ncourse might be due to the fact that, like ourselves, they had lowered\r\ntheir now useless canvas.  With not a breath of air stirring it was\r\nintensely hot, the rays of the unclouded sun beating down upon us\r\nfiercely as the breath of a furnace, and I inwardly execrated that\r\nscoundrel Bainbridge and his lawless crew as I thought of the crowded\r\nlongboat and the hapless women and children--to say nothing of the\r\nwounded skipper--pent up in her, with nothing to protect them from the\r\npitiless heat and glare.\r\n\r\n\"Well, shipmates,\" I said, \"we shall do ourselves no good by lying here\r\nidly sweltering.  This calm may last for a week, for aught that we can\r\ntell; there is not the slightest sign of a breeze springing up, so far\r\nas I can see.  I propose, therefore, that instead of doing nothing we\r\nstrike the mast, out oars, and go in search of a wind.  There is no\r\nneed,\" I continued, seeing signs of a protest on the faces of my\r\ncompanions, \"for us to exert ourselves very greatly; and we can scarcely\r\nmake ourselves hotter than we are, do what we will.  I therefore suggest\r\nthat we throw out the oars and paddle quietly ahead upon our proper\r\ncourse.  We ought to be able to get three knots out of the boat with\r\nlittle exertion, and every mile of progress means so much to the good:\r\nmoreover, I want you all to remember that we cannot afford to lie idly\r\nhere; our stock of provisions will only last a certain time, and just\r\npicture to yourselves what our condition will be if, through suffering\r\nourselves to be delayed by calms, these provisions--and our water--\r\nshould become exhausted before we reach land or are picked up.  My idea\r\nis that four of us should pull while the fifth steers, and that at the\r\nend of one hour by the watch he who steers should relieve one of us at\r\nthe oars, so that every four hours each of us will get one hour's rest.\r\nNow, what say you, lads?  It is Mr Cunningham's watch, therefore let\r\nhim take the first spell at the yoke lines.\"\r\n\r\nIt was easy enough to see that the others did not like the idea of\r\nworking at the oars in that blistering sun, nor was that to be wondered\r\nat; but my reminder to them of the possibilities in store for us should\r\nour provisions and water be exhausted before relief in some shape or\r\nother came to us had its effect.  With many grumblings and imprecations\r\nat the inopportune calm, they set to work to strike the mast, ship the\r\nrowlocks, and get out the oars; and five minutes later, myself pulling\r\nstroke, and Cunningham in the sternsheets with the yoke lines in his\r\nhands and his compass charm on the seat beside him, we were moving\r\nquietly and easily to the westward at a speed of quite three knots.\r\n\r\nFortunately for us the gig was a particularly good boat of the whaleboat\r\ntype, built for speed, long and flat on the floor, with beautiful lines;\r\nand apart from the low swell, which did not trouble us at all, the water\r\nwas smooth as oil.  When, therefore, we had once got way upon the boat\r\nit was an easy matter to keep her going without very much exertion.  But\r\nhot!  Only those who have been exposed in an open boat at sea in a\r\ntropical calm can in the least understand or appreciate what we\r\nsuffered.  The sun's rays, striking almost vertically down upon our\r\nheads, and reflected upward again from the shining surface of the water,\r\nscorched us like fire, and before the first hour had passed my face was\r\n_so_ painful that I scarcely dared touch it.  And oh, how we perspired!\r\nIn less than ten minutes my singlet and drawers--which were all that I\r\nhad on, having like the rest stripped off all the rest of my clothing--\r\nwere as wet as though I had been overboard.  And the natural result of\r\nsuch profuse perspiration was that we soon became intolerably thirsty.\r\nI don't know which of us was the first to suffer from this cause, but I\r\nknow that I had not been at my oar more than twenty minutes when I began\r\nto feel that I would willingly give everything I possessed for a good\r\nlong cooling draught of spring water.  However, I clenched my teeth and\r\nsaid nothing, for I knew perfectly well that if the word \"thirst\" were\r\nonce mentioned all hands would instantly begin to clamour for water, and\r\nI might have the greatest difficulty in restraining the others from\r\nmaking a raid upon the breakers, regardless of consequences.\r\n\r\nBut, after all, my self-restraint was of little practical value, for\r\npresently the carpenter flung the loom of his oar athwart the boat until\r\nit rested upon the gunwale, and, tossing his clenched fists above his\r\nhead, cried in a husky, unnatural tone of voice:\r\n\r\n\"Great jumpin' Gehosophat, how thirsty I am!  Mr Temple, I votes we\r\nknock off long enough to have a drink all round.  I'm as dry as a\r\nlimekiln inside; my tongue's beginnin' to rattle again' my teeth, an'--\"\r\n\r\n\"The more reason why you should keep it quiet, Chips,\" I retorted\r\nsharply.  \"Thirsty!  Of course you are; so are we all, for that matter:\r\nbut there is no reason why we should yelp about it.  And as for having a\r\ndrink, you know as well as I do that, with the small quantity of water\r\nwhich we have in the boat, it has been necessary for us to pledge\r\nourselves solemnly to take no more than a certain quantity daily, and we\r\nmust wait for our next drink until dinner-time comes along--\"\r\n\r\n\"But, Mr Temple,\" interrupted the sailmaker, who with the others,\r\nmyself included, had now cocked his oar, \"our proper 'lowance of water\r\nis 'alf a pint at each meal, and another 'alf a pint at some other time.\r\nCan't we 'ave that there hextry 'alf pint now?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, you certainly cannot,\" I answered, as well as I was able to speak\r\nfor the saliva that gathered in my mouth at the mere thought of that\r\nnectar-like half-pint of water.  \"If you did, you would be as thirsty as\r\never within the next half-hour, and then you would be sorry enough that\r\nthere was no more water coming to you, except at meal times, for the\r\nrest of the day.  But I'll tell you what I'll do.  It is now,\" glancing\r\nat my watch, \"within three minutes of nine o'clock.  At ten we will take\r\na spell of ten minutes, and each man shall then have the third part of\r\nhalf a pint of water, with a suspicion of rum in it as a pick-me-up.\r\nThen at twelve we shall dine, and each man shall have his half-pint; at\r\nthree o'clock we will have another third of half a pint; at six we shall\r\nhave supper; and at nine o'clock, if we find that we really require it,\r\nwe will have the remaining third of half a pint.  Now, that is the best\r\nI can do; it is the only thing that we dare do, and we must just make\r\nthe best of it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" agreed Cunningham, \"you are quite right, Mr Temple; we must be\r\nsatisfied with our strict allowance, and ask for no more.  But there is\r\none thing we may do to ease our thirst, and it is wonderfully\r\nefficacious.  Let each man take off his clothes, saturate them with salt\r\nwater, and put them on again soaking wet.  If we do this, say, once\r\nevery half-hour, we shall find ourselves marvellously refreshed, and\r\nquite able to wait for a drink until the proper time for it arrives.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ay,\" said I, \"I have heard of that trick before, and a splendid one it\r\nis, too, I believe, although I have never had occasion to try it until\r\nnow.  Let us test it at once, lads.  I remember once hearing a man say\r\nthat if shipwrecked people would only keep their clothes thoroughly\r\nsaturated with salt water, they could practically manage to do without\r\ndrinking at all.\"  And without further ado I stripped off my singlet and\r\npants, wrung the perspiration out of them, plunged them over the side,\r\nand put them on again, my example being immediately followed by the\r\nothers.  Then, the time having arrived for Cunningham to take a spell at\r\nthe oar, he exchanged places with the sailmaker, and we again proceeded.\r\n\r\nThe sensation of coolness imparted by the contact of our wet clothing\r\nwith our bodies was very refreshing, and as long as it lasted we were\r\nable to pull a quick, steady stroke that put us along at the rate of\r\nabout three knots with little or no fatigue.  The worst of it was that\r\nit did not last long, for within ten minutes the sun had dried our\r\nclothes again, and we began to perspire once more.  But we soon found a\r\nsimple remedy for this by ceasing work just long enough to enable us to\r\npour two or three buckets of water over each other, and then getting to\r\nwork again; and although these frequent stoppages no doubt had the\r\neffect of retarding our progress to some extent, I do not think our\r\nactual loss of speed was very great, for the refreshment derived from\r\nthese often-repeated sousings was such that we were able to put a good\r\ndeal more life and vigour into our work than would otherwise have been\r\npossible.  As regards the alleged abatement of thirst, although I did\r\nnot experience any perceptible relief during the first half-hour of the\r\nexperiment, I certainly did afterwards, and so did the others; and\r\nalthough at ten o'clock we each avidly took our third of half a pint of\r\nwater, there were no further complaints of thirst.  And here let me\r\nmention, for the benefit of any reader who may be so unfortunate as to\r\nfind himself at any time in a similar predicament, that I then made the\r\nimportant discovery that the most effectual method of assuaging thirst\r\nwith a very limited quantity of water is not to gulp it down and have\r\ndone with it, but to sip it slowly, about a teaspoonful at a time, and\r\nretain each sip in the mouth at least half a minute before swallowing\r\nit.  The amount of comfort--not to say enjoyment--relief, and\r\nrefreshment thus obtainable is nothing short of marvellous.\r\n\r\nBut, despite every device that we could think of to obtain relief, our\r\nsufferings during that day were terrible; for although, by assiduously\r\nsousing each other with salt water at frequent intervals, we contrived\r\nto avoid the worst torments of thirst, our faces, arms, and hands--in\r\nfact all the exposed portions of our bodies, were so frightfully\r\nscorched by the sun that even before knocking-off work to take our\r\nmidday meal we had begun to blister, and by nightfall our faces and arms\r\nwere covered with blisters.  And all through that interminable day we\r\ntoiled on and on at the oars, with not a shred of cloud to be seen in\r\nany direction, the blazing sun scorching us remorselessly, and the sea\r\nall round us a polished, shining, gently undulating, colourless plain,\r\nunbroken by so much as a solitary ripple, save those created by our oar\r\nblades, the passage of the gig through the water, the occasional dash of\r\nhalf a dozen flying-fish out of the sea under the boat's stem, and once\r\nor twice the thin wake cut by the dorsal fin of a cruising shark.\r\n\r\nBut about three-quarters of an hour before sunset the carpenter, who was\r\nthen steering the boat, shouted: \"Hurrah, my bullies, there's a change\r\nof some sort comin' at last!  See the edge of that there cloud liftin'\r\nover the sea line ahead?  That means wind, or I'll eat my hat; ay, and\r\np'rhaps rain too.  What do you think, Mr Temple?\"\r\n\r\nWith one accord we all cocked our oars, and, standing up, I took a good\r\nlong look ahead, secretly welcoming, I will confess, the excuse to cease\r\npulling for a minute or two; for my back was by this time aching\r\nfrightfully, and the skin of my thumbs, just where they joined the\r\nhands, was so completely chafed away that the flesh was red, raw, and\r\nbleeding.  Yes, there was the edge of a cloud, distinct enough, the\r\nwhite, clean-cut, sharp-edged upper portion of a big thunder cloud,\r\nunless I was greatly mistaken.  And it was rising fast, too, so fast\r\nthat, even as I stood gazing at it, it fully doubled its area and\r\npermitted us a glimpse of the soft, slaty-blue tint merging into the\r\nwhite.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" I agreed, replying to Parsons' question, \"the change is coming\r\nall right, and it will not be very long before it is here.  Lay in your\r\noars, men.  I think, in prospect of what that cloud promises, that we\r\nmay venture to spare ourselves any further ash-flourishing to-day, for\r\nwe shall have a breeze before very long, with thunder, lightning, and\r\nrain as well, unless I am greatly mistaken.  And we will pipe to supper\r\nat once, so that we may be able to get our meal in peace and quietness,\r\nand have it over and done with before the breeze comes.  We are likely\r\nenough to have plenty of other matters than eating and drinking to think\r\nabout and attend to when that happens.\"\r\n\r\nThe oars were laid in, willingly enough, for the other four were in just\r\nas bad a plight as I was.  Cunningham, indeed, was far worse, for,\r\nunlike ours, his hands were soft and tender, and when, after the oars\r\nhad been laid in, he stretched out his hands, palms upwards, and showed\r\nthem to me, they presented a positively sickening sight.  But when I\r\nmurmured my regret and commiseration he only smiled and expressed the\r\nconviction that they would be all right again in a week, for he was one\r\nof the pluckiest men I ever met, grit all through, straight as a die,\r\nand with not a bad spot anywhere in him; he was, in fact, everything\r\nthat we are apt to think a typical Briton should be.\r\n\r\nWe lost no time in getting the meal that we called by courtesy \"supper\";\r\nand within half an hour had disposed of it, and were waiting patiently\r\nfor whatever was to come.  But while it was still calm and light I had\r\nthe mast stepped, and sent the sailmaker aloft to take a good,\r\ncomprehensive look round and see whether he could discover any sign of a\r\nsail; and no sooner had he, with much pain and tribulation, climbed to\r\nthe top of his precarious perch than he sang out that he could just see,\r\nin the northern board, what looked like the heads of a ship's royals.\r\nOf course he could not tell in which direction she was bound, for, like\r\nourselves, she was becalmed, and slowly \"boxing the compass,\" that is to\r\nsay, her head was pointing first one way and then another; but while he\r\nwas aloft, clinging to the boat's masthead, and watching the stranger in\r\nthe hope of being able to make some further discovery concerning her,\r\nher people started to clew up and furl her royals, which circumstance\r\nSimpson duly reported.  It served as a hint to us in the gig, for if the\r\nstranger had detected symptoms that her royals would presently be too\r\nmuch for her, it was high time for us to look after ourselves; and we\r\naccordingly proceeded forthwith to close-reef our lug, and otherwise\r\nmake such preparations as were possible to enable us effectively to meet\r\nthe onslaught of the threatened squall.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER FOUR.\r\n\r\nAT THE MERCY OF WIND AND SEA.\r\n\r\nThat a squall was indeed brewing was by this time perfectly evident; for\r\nwhile we had been getting our supper the cloud which had made its\r\nappearance on the western horizon had rapidly risen, and now hung, an\r\nenormous lowering mass of livid purple vapour, in the western heavens,\r\ncovering an arc of the horizon of fully a hundred degrees, completely\r\nhiding the setting sun, and towering aloft until its upper edge was\r\nnearly overhead.  Yet so far there was not a breath of wind, and the\r\nsurface of the sea remained an unbroken, polished mirror, perfectly\r\nreflecting the hues of the overhanging cloud to the westward and the\r\ndeep rich azure of the sky away down toward the east; and when Simpson\r\nagain climbed the boat's mast to take a final look at the stranger, he\r\nreported her naked mastheads as standing up black, sharp, and motionless\r\nagainst the soft primrose tones of the northern sky.\r\n\r\nSome ten minutes later, and just as the brief twilight of that region\r\nhad begun to veil the scene, we saw a faint glimmer of lightning in the\r\nheart of the now slowly advancing cloud, and a few seconds after the low\r\nmutter of thunder reached our ears.  And before the rumble of this had\r\ndied away there suddenly darted from the bosom of the cloud a long,\r\nvivid, baleful, sun-bright flash that seemed to strike into the sea\r\nwithin a quarter of a mile of us, immediately followed by so stupendous\r\na crash that it caused the very timbers of our boat to vibrate and\r\ntremble--or so I verily believed.  And as though that flash had been a\r\nsignal, the great cloud seemed suddenly to burst apart, and the next\r\nmoment we were enveloped in a very deluge of rain, which fairly roared\r\nas it threshed the surface of the sea all round us.\r\n\r\n\"The bread! the bread!\"  I shouted.  \"Cover it with the tarpaulin and\r\nkeep it dry.  If we let it get wet it will be spoiled,\" and immediately\r\nwe all made a dash for the two bags of biscuits and hastily enveloped\r\nthem in a small sheet of tarpaulin that Chips had had the forethought to\r\ntoss into the gig while she was being lowered from the davits.\r\n\r\n\"Now,\" said I, as soon as we had taken such precautions as were possible\r\nfor the preservation of our bread, \"spread out the sail, from gunwale to\r\ngunwale, right across the boat.  This rain is far too precious to be\r\nwasted.  That's your sort, bos'n, make a good deep sag in the middle of\r\nthe sail--it will soon fill at this rate; and then we can all drink as\r\nmuch as we please, and put what more we can catch into the broached\r\nbreaker, filling it until it overflows.  Find the pannikin, one of you;\r\nthere is enough for a drink round already.\"\r\n\r\nThe hollow sail filled with the sweet, tepid rainwater faster than we\r\ncould drink it; and before the rain ceased we had each emptied the pint\r\npannikin twice and had filled the broached breaker right up to the edge\r\nof its bung-hole.  Then we had another drink all round, after which we\r\nbathed our smarting, blistered hands in the cooling liquid before\r\nemptying it into the sea.  The downpour lasted for perhaps twelve\r\nminutes; then it ceased as suddenly as it had begun--as suddenly as\r\nthough a tap had been turned off up aloft--and we had an opportunity\r\nonce more to look around us.  And, glancing instinctively to the\r\nwestward in the first instance--for that was where we expected the wind\r\nto come from--the first thing we saw, in the fast-deepening twilight,\r\nwas a broad belt of dark water, flecked here and there with white, about\r\na mile distant, and advancing in our direction.\r\n\r\n\"Hurrah, lads!\"  I exclaimed, \"here comes the breeze--a foul one it is\r\ntrue, but even a foul wind, so long as there is not too much of it, is\r\nbetter than none at all.  Set the lug for a board on the port tack;\r\nsince we can't go straight to our port I'll make a board to the nor'ard,\r\nwhich will at least be going in the right direction.  Yes, bos'n,\" in\r\nreply to a question from that functionary, \"keep the sail close-reefed;\r\nwe shall have all the wind we want, and a little over, before very long,\r\nunless I am greatly mistaken.\"\r\n\r\nThe wind swooped down upon us in a fierce little flurry that careened\r\nthe gig to her gunwale, despite the careful tending of the sheet by the\r\nboatswain; then, with all hands of us sitting well up to windward, the\r\nboat gathered way and darted off upon a course that was as nearly as\r\nmight be due north-west, lying well down to it, with the spray from the\r\nshort, choppy seas that the squall instantly whipped up showering in\r\nover her sharp weather bow at every plunge, and quickly drenching us to\r\nthe skin.  But there was worse to come, for the wind was freshening\r\nevery moment and rapidly kicking up a short, steep, choppy sea, the\r\nsurges of which smothered us with spray as the gig leaped viciously at\r\nthem under the steadily increasing pressure of the wind upon her\r\nclose-reefed lugsail; so that within a very few minutes it was taking\r\none hand all his time to keep the boat free of water by continually\r\nbaling with the bucket, although we eased the craft as much as possible\r\nby keeping the weather-leech of the sail ashiver most of the time.\r\n\r\n\"Just our luck!\" growled the boatswain, as he slacked the sheet to a\r\nstill fiercer puff.  \"If this had been a fair wind, now, we could have\r\nshown whole canvas to it, and would have been reelin' off our seven, or\r\neven eight knots as easily as possible.  But, as it is, we can't make no\r\nheadway agin it; and the time ain't far off, in my opinion, when we'll\r\nhave to up stick and run afore it.\"\r\n\r\n\"We'll not do that until we are obliged,\" said I.  \"I don't feel at all\r\nlike losing, in the course of two or three hours, the ground that we\r\nhave made by the hardest day's work that I ever did in my life.  No,\r\nMurdock, when we can't face it any longer we will lash the oars together\r\nand ride to them as a sea anchor at the full scope of our painter.  They\r\nwill keep the boat head-on to wind and sea, and we shall ride as\r\ncomfortably that way as any other; while, although our drift will\r\nprobably amount to as much as three knots every hour, we shall not lose\r\nnearly as much ground as we should by scudding before--\"\r\n\r\nI was interrupted by the sailmaker, who was sitting far enough forward\r\nto be able to see some distance past the luff of the sail.  Seaman-like,\r\nhe was instinctively keeping a lookout, and he now suddenly turned and\r\nyelled:\r\n\r\n\"Sail ho! close aboard on the lee bow.  Hard up, Mr Temple; hard up,\r\nsir, and keep her broad away, or that chap'll run us down.\"\r\n\r\nThere was an urgency and imperativeness in the man's tones which made it\r\nclear enough that there was no time for investigation.  I therefore did\r\nthe only thing that remained to be done under the circumstances, namely,\r\ntrusted to the correctness of Sails's judgment and implicitly followed\r\nhis directions, dragging the tiller hard up, and at the same time\r\ncalling upon the boatswain to ease off the sheet still further.  Under\r\nthe pressure of her weather helm the boat at once fell broad off; and as\r\nshe did so I saw, through the rapidly deepening darkness, a great black\r\nblotch swing into view past the luff of our sail, which the next instant\r\nresolved itself into the shape of a big, hulking brigantine, wallowing\r\nalong down toward us with her topsail-yard down on the cap, her reef\r\ntackles bowsed up, and eight men on her yard busily engaged in reefing\r\nher topsail.  It was not yet so dark but that those men must have seen\r\nus distinctly--in fact one of them paused in his work to flourish his\r\nhand at us; yet, but for the sailmaker's watchfulness, the craft would\r\nhave driven right over us!  There could be no doubt of the fact that her\r\ncrew had seen us, for, in addition to the man who waved to us from the\r\nyard, there were two men pacing her monkey poop aft who paused in their\r\nmarch to look at us as we drove past each other; yet, although we yelled\r\nto them frantically to heave-to and pick us up, they made no movement to\r\ndo anything of the sort, and ten minutes later the craft vanished in the\r\ndarkness.  The light was too poor to enable us to read the name on her\r\nstern as she swept past us, but she had all the look of a\r\nPortuguese-built craft; and, justly or unjustly, the Portuguese have\r\ngained rather a sinister reputation for callousness and inhumanity in\r\ntheir behaviour toward people circumstanced as we were at that moment.\r\n\r\n\"I s'pose they thinks we're out here in a hopen boat for pleasure and\r\nthe fun o' the thing,\" was the boatswain's sarcastic comment upon their\r\nbehaviour, prefaced by a stream of profanity, as the vessel disappeared\r\nfrom our view.\r\n\r\nAs soon as we realised that the crew of the brigantine had no intention\r\nof heaving-to and picking us up we again brought the gig to the wind.\r\nBut we soon found that this would not do: the wind and sea were both\r\nrapidly becoming too much for us, and to continue fighting against them\r\nmeant the speedy swamping or capsizal of the boat.  We therefore adopted\r\nthe plan which I had been expounding to the boatswain when the\r\nbrigantine hove into view, securely lashing the four oars of the boat\r\ntogether in a bundle, bending the extreme end of our painter to the\r\nmiddle of the bundle, and launching the whole overboard, at the same\r\ntime lowering the sail and striking the mast, when the drag of the boat\r\nupon the oars brought her head to wind and sea, and enabled her to ride\r\nin comparative safety and comfort, although a breaking sea occasionally\r\nslopped in over her bows, necessitating the frequent employment of the\r\nbucket as a baler.\r\n\r\nThere was very little sleep for any of us that night, for within an hour\r\nit was blowing really hard, with a heavy, steep sea that frequently\r\nbroke aboard us, causing us intense discomfort as the water rushed aft\r\nand surged about our feet and legs to the wild plunging of the boat, and\r\nkeeping one or another of us constantly busy baling to prevent the boat\r\nfrom being swamped.  We were thankful that we had not the added\r\ndiscomfort of cold to contend with, for, hard though it blew, the wind\r\nwas quite warm; yet, even so, it was unpleasant enough, since we were in\r\nthe greatest peril every moment of that long, weary night, our utmost\r\nefforts being continually required to keep the boat above water.  But,\r\nnotwithstanding everything, it was a fine, exhilarating experience; for,\r\nadded to the joy of battle with the elements, there was the wild\r\ngrandeur of the scene, the great masses of black cloud scurrying athwart\r\nthe sky, with little patches of starlit blue winking in and out between,\r\nthe roar and swoop of the wind, and the menacing hiss of the\r\nphosphorescent foam-caps as they came rushing down upon the boat in\r\nendless succession, all combining together to form a picture the like of\r\nwhich, as viewed from a wildly leaping, half-swamped, spray-smothered\r\nopen boat, it is given to comparatively few men to look upon.\r\n\r\nThe gale lasted all through the night, breaking at sunrise; but although\r\nthe sky cleared with the coming of the dawn, the wind continued to blow\r\nso strongly that it was not until the sun had crossed the meridian that\r\nit again became possible for us to make sail upon the boat: and\r\nmeanwhile we found that during the night it had hauled round from the\r\nnorth-west, and was therefore still practically dead in our teeth.  But\r\nthe moment that the sea had gone down enough to render sailing once more\r\npossible, we got under way and headed westward close-hauled upon the\r\nstarboard tack, under a double-reefed sail; and I took fresh heart when\r\npresently I saw that, even under the exceedingly unfavourable conditions\r\nthen prevailing--and they were about as unfavourable as they could\r\npossibly be--the boat was keeping a good luff, hanging well to windward,\r\nthanks to an exceptionally deep keel, and making about four knots of\r\nheadway every hour.\r\n\r\nMy hopes rose high that even yet, despite the delays which we had\r\nalready experienced, we might be able to cover the distance to the coast\r\nbefore our provisions gave out; for if we were doing well under almost\r\nthe worst conditions that could possibly befall us, what might we not do\r\nwhen those conditions improved?  And they certainly did improve as the\r\nafternoon wore on, for the wind eventually dropped sufficiently to\r\npermit us to shake out our reefs and sail the boat under whole canvas,\r\nwhile with the moderating of the wind the sea also went down and ceased\r\nto break, although the swell still ran very high.  But it was only the\r\nheavily breaking seas that were really dangerous to us; and now that we\r\nno longer had them to fear we drove the gig for all that she was worth,\r\nluffing her through the fresher puffs, hawsing her up to windward fathom\r\nby fathom, and generally handling her as though we were sailing her in a\r\nrace, as indeed we were in a sense--a race against time.\r\n\r\nWe continued to do exceedingly well all through that afternoon, and\r\nindeed up to about midnight; but the wind was softening all the time,\r\nand shortly after midnight our speed began to slacken, until by daylight\r\nof the next morning it had once more fallen to less than three knots.\r\nMoreover, the weather was by no means satisfactory in appearance; there\r\nwere no actual clouds to be seen in the sky, but instead of being a\r\nclear, deep, rich blue, as it ought to have been, and as it no doubt\r\nwould have been had there been fine weather in prospect, the entire\r\nvault of heaven was veiled in a thick, steamy, colourless haze, through\r\nwhich the sun showed as a feeble, shapeless blotch of white.  There was\r\nbarely enough wind, still dead against us, to fan us along at a bare two\r\nknots; but I did not like the look of the sea, which, despite the almost\r\ntotal absence of wind, was in a strange state of unrest, the long heave\r\nof the swell being overrun by small, short, choppy miniature seas, which\r\nseemed to leap up at brief intervals without visible cause, and then\r\ncurled over and fell in a casual, sloppy manner that suggested the idea\r\nthat they would have liked to break but could not summon up the energy\r\nto do so.\r\n\r\nBut whatever else they may have failed to do, these sloppy seas managed\r\nto retard the way of the boat through the water very considerably, and\r\nto fill our souls with exasperation; for they were distinctly hindering\r\nour progress, while we could see no valid reason why they should exist\r\nat all.  They had the appearance of having sprung up solely to delay us,\r\nand for no other purpose whatever.  More than once, when I felt\r\nexceptionally impatient at our miserably slow rate of progress, I had it\r\non the tip of my tongue to propose that we should again take to the\r\noars; but I did not actually speak the words, for in the first place I\r\ndoubted whether the gain in speed would be sufficient to justify the\r\nexpenditure of strength, and in the next place our hands were by this\r\ntime in such a frightful condition of rawness that the idea of proposing\r\nwhat would make them very much worse seemed to smack of downright\r\ncruelty, unless I could urge some more valid reason than the mere desire\r\nto get ahead a little faster.  And our situation just then was scarcely\r\ndesperate enough for that.\r\n\r\nIt was very shortly after midday, and we were all gathered aft partaking\r\nof the meal that we dignified with the name of dinner, when the\r\nboatswain, who was sitting on the after thwart, facing me, suddenly\r\npaused in the act of conveying a piece of biscuit to his mouth, stared\r\nintently over my shoulder for a moment, and then sprang to his feet,\r\nshading his eyes with his hand.\r\n\r\n\"What is it, Murdock?\"  I asked, turning as I spoke in the direction\r\ntoward which he was gazing, \"do you--?\"\r\n\r\n\"Sail ho!\" interrupted the boatswain, pointing eagerly with his hand.\r\n\"Do ye see her, Mr Temple, sir?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ay, I do,\" I answered, as I caught sight of a faint pearly gleam afar\r\noff on the north-eastern horizon.  \"Mr Cunningham, will you kindly lend\r\nme your telescope for a moment?\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly, with pleasure,\" answered Cunningham, producing the\r\ninstrument from his pocket.  It was not a very big affair, being only\r\nabout six inches long by perhaps an inch and a half in diameter, but it\r\nwas a three-draw tube, measuring about one foot nine inches long when\r\nfully extended, and, for its size, was the most splendid instrument I\r\nhad ever used.  I quickly brought it to bear upon the distant gleam,\r\nwhich the lenses instantly resolved into the heads of the fore and main\r\nroyals of a craft--either a barque or a brig--standing to the southward.\r\nWhen I had finished with the instrument the boatswain took a squint\r\nthrough it, and after him the carpenter and the sailmaker; and when they\r\nhad had their turn Cunningham applied it to his eye.  As the boatswain\r\npassed the telescope over to Chips he turned to me eagerly and looked at\r\nme hard with _so_ expressive an eye that I instantly read what was in\r\nhis mind.  I shook my head.\r\n\r\n\"We could never do it, Murdock,\" I said.  \"She's too far to the\r\nsouth'ard.  Had she borne three, or even a couple of points farther to\r\nthe nor'ard I might have felt inclined to risk it; but--\"\r\n\r\n\"What are you talking about?\" demanded Cunningham.  \"Is it a question of\r\nwhether we can or cannot intercept that ship?  Because if it is, I am\r\nmost emphatically in favour of our making the attempt.  Mind you, I do\r\nnot say that we can actually intercept her; but I believe we might\r\nmanage to get close enough to her to be seen, for she is almost certain\r\nto have a man or two aloft at work upon her rigging.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, ye're right, Mr Cunnin'ham; that's exactly my notion,\" eagerly\r\nagreed the boatswain.  \"I believe that by runnin' away off in about this\r\nhere direction,\" pointing away toward the south--east, \"we ought to lift\r\nher pretty nigh to her rail by the time that she draws up abreast of us;\r\nand if we can do that we stands a very good chance of bein' seen.  I\r\nhaven't no great faith in our prospec's of fetchin' Rio; and if we gets\r\nhalf a chance of bein' picked up by a ship, we ought to take it.\r\nMoreover than that, I don't like the look of the weather none too well;\r\nand I'd a deal rather spend the comin' night aboard that ship than in\r\nthis here gig.\"\r\n\r\nThere was certainly good, sound reason and common sense in Murdock's\r\nwords, and particularly in what he said about the weather; so I turned\r\nto the carpenter, to ascertain his view of the matter.\r\n\r\n\"What do you say, Chips?\"  I asked.  \"Are you of opinion that we shall\r\nbe justified in losing ten or fifteen miles of ground upon the\r\noff-chance of being able to close with yonder craft near enough to be\r\nseen?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, yes, Mr Temple, I certainly am,\" answered Chips.  \"I won't go so\r\nfar as to say that we'll be actually able to manage it; but I think it's\r\nour dooty to have a good try for it.  I'm like the bos'n, I've got a\r\nsort of feelin' that we ain't goin' to fetch Rio this trip--\"\r\n\r\n\"All right, then,\" I said; \"you three constitute the majority, even if\r\nSails happens to think as I do--\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, but I don't, Mr Temple!\" interrupted Simpson.  \"I agrees with the\r\nbos'n--\"\r\n\r\n\"Then round we go,\" I interrupted in my turn; and, putting the helm hard\r\nup, I bore away, the sail jibed over, and off we went almost dead before\r\nthe wind, heading about south-east, and bringing the stranger about a\r\npoint and a half abaft our port beam.\r\n\r\nSailing before the wind was a very different matter from plugging to\r\nwindward with the sheet flattened well in, and although our shift of\r\nhelm had the effect of making it seem that the wind had suddenly died\r\naway almost to nothing, there was no longer that heart-breaking\r\nsmack-smack of the small seas against our weather bow which had seemed\r\nto retard our way in such an exasperating fashion.  On the contrary,\r\nwith the sheet eased well off and the lug boomed out with the boathook\r\nso that the yard swung square across the length of the boat, we went\r\nsliding smoothly away to leeward with a long, easy, buoyant motion, a\r\npleasant, musical gurgling of water along our bottom planking, and a\r\nswift gliding past us of tiny air bubbles and occasional morsels of weed\r\nthat told us we were now travelling at the rate of quite four knots.\r\n\r\nFor the first half-hour the stranger did not appreciably alter her\r\nbearing relative to the boat, which seemed to indicate that we were\r\npractically holding our own with her, and our hopes soared high,\r\nespecially as within that brief period we had raised her royals and the\r\nheads of her topgallantsails above the horizon.  But when this latter\r\ncircumstance enabled us to see that she had her starboard topgallant\r\nstuddingsails set, my enthusiasm flagged again, for I argued that she\r\nmust be a slow-coach indeed if, with the breeze then blowing and\r\nstuddingsails set, she could not do any better than four knots.  I held\r\nmy peace, however, for there was no use in damping the hopes of the\r\nothers, while there was always the possibility that if any of her hands\r\nhappened to be employed aloft, the eye of one or another of them might\r\nchance upon our sail, which, small though it was, ought to be perfectly\r\nvisible at a distance of five or six miles, even in that somewhat hazy\r\natmosphere.  But by the end of the first hour after we had begun our\r\nchase it became apparent that she had the heels of us, for although we\r\nwere still steering exactly the same course as at first, she had drawn\r\nup square abeam of us.  And there it was imperatively necessary that we\r\nshould keep her if we did not wish her to slip past us, even although\r\nthe keeping of her there should entail upon us the necessity to edge\r\ngradually away, thus bringing our own course ever more nearly parallel\r\nto hers, instead of causing the two steadily to converge.  Then, about\r\nthe end of the second hour of the chase, by which time we had lifted the\r\nstranger's main topsail-yard above the horizon, and had discovered that\r\nshe was barque-rigged, the breeze suddenly freshened up sufficiently to\r\nadd an extra knot and a half to our speed.  But this was a misfortune\r\nrather than otherwise for us: for although it increased our speed, it\r\nalso increased that of the stranger, when it reached her, which it did\r\nabout ten minutes later; and whereas it added only about a knot and a\r\nhalf to our rate of travel, it probably quickened up her pace by more\r\nthan double that amount, as was painfully apparent from the increased\r\nfrequency with which we were obliged to edge away to keep her square\r\nabeam.  And now the anxiety which I had all along felt began to be\r\nshared by the others, one or another of whom kept Cunningham's telescope\r\ncontinually bearing upon the barque.  They began to fidget where they\r\nsat, to mutter and grumble under their breath, and to cast frequent\r\nlooks at the sky astern, which had not materially altered its aspect\r\nsince the morning, except that the haze had thickened somewhat.  At last\r\nthe boatswain could restrain himself no longer.\r\n\r\n\"If this here humbuggin' breeze'd only drop,\" he grumbled, \"we'd out\r\noars and pull to her.  But it ain't goin' to drop, that's the worst of\r\nit, it's agoin' to freshen still furder; and that cussed old hooker's\r\ngoin' to run away from us, that's what she's agoin' to do.  Let's have a\r\nlook at that there glass again, Mr Cunnin'ham,\" he continued.  \"I can't\r\nmake out what they're a-thinkin' about aboard her.  It's fine weather,\r\nand surely there ought to be some work to be done aloft.\"  Here he got\r\nthe telescope to bear upon her for at least the tenth time since the\r\nchase had begun, and relapsed into temporary silence, while he subjected\r\nevery visible part of her to a most searching scrutiny.  Presently he\r\nresumed, with animation: \"Ah!  I thought it'd be strange if her bos'n\r\ncouldn't find somethin' that wanted doin' aloft in such fine weather as\r\nthis.  Just you take this here glass, Mr Temple--Chips'll catch hold of\r\nthe tiller for a minute or two--and see if there ain't a man sittin'\r\nastride of her weather main tawps'l-yardarm doin' somethin' or other.\"\r\n\r\nI handed over the tiller to Chips, took the telescope, and raised the\r\neyepiece to my eye.  Instantly I had a small but exquisitely clear\r\npicture of the three masts of the distant barque, from the level of the\r\nsecond reef-band of her main topsail upward, with every rope and piece\r\nof rigging and gear, even to the reef-points of the topsail, rising and\r\nfalling upon the horizon line with the lift of the ship upon the swell.\r\nAnd there, sure enough, at the point named by the boatswain, but tucked\r\naway in the shadow of the weather clew of the topgallantsail, so that it\r\nwas not very easy to make him out, I saw what I certainly took to be the\r\nfigure of a man.  And that the boatswain and I were not mistaken\r\npresently became apparent, for, while I still looked, the fellow\r\nleisurely swung himself on to the foot rope and began to lay in along\r\nthe yard.\r\n\r\n\"Quick!\"  I exclaimed, \"we must attract his attention somehow, for he\r\nhas finished his job and is laying in off the yard.  Off with your\r\njacket, Sails, and jump up on the thwart and wave it for all you are\r\nworth!\"\r\n\r\nThe sailmaker tore off his white canvas jacket, and, grasping it by one\r\narm, sprang up on the mast thwart and waved it furiously, while I kept\r\nthe telescope focused upon the slowly moving figure of the distant\r\nseaman.  But the man worked his way steadily in, swung himself off the\r\nyard to the topmast rigging, and, with the merchant sailor's usual\r\ndeliberation, descended until he vanished below the horizon line,\r\nseemingly without giving a single glance at the widespreading surface of\r\nsea that stretched away for miles on either side of him.\r\n\r\n\"That will do, Sails,\" I said; \"you may belay your flourishing, and get\r\ndown off the thwart.  That shellback has gone down on deck without so\r\nmuch as a glance in our direction.\"\r\n\r\n\"Laid down, have he, without stoppin' so much as to take a look round?\"\r\nsnarled the boatswain savagely, dashing his clenched fist down on the\r\ngunwale.  \"I'll be jiggered if I can understan' what's comin' to the\r\nsailorman as sails these here seas.  Fust there was that there Portugee,\r\nas went past without stoppin' to pick us up, although they see'd us, and\r\nmust 'ave knowed that we was castaways; and now here's this here\r\nbloomin' barque, manned by chaps as don't seem to think it worth while\r\nto give a look round while they're aloft, to see whether there's any\r\npoor sailormen washin' about in distress.  But she ain't British, I'll\r\ntake my Bible oath o' that; the British shellback don't do that there\r\nsort o' thing.  Why, when I first went to sea we was never ordered aloft\r\nbut what the skipper used to say: `Take a good look round, men, afore\r\nyou comes down again.  We never knows when we may be passin' within\r\nsight of some poor unfortunate, perishin' of hunger and thirst, and\r\nprayin' to be sighted and picked up!'\"\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said I, \"I am afraid it is all up with us, so far as that barque\r\nis concerned.  Nevertheless, we will stick to her as long as she remains\r\nin sight.  Another hand may be sent aloft aboard her before she\r\ndisappears; or the wind may drop--although I confess I see no sign of it\r\nat present.  And in any case it is comforting, in a way, to know that we\r\nare in the track of the south-bound ships; we are certain to sight\r\nothers within the next day or two, and it will be pretty poor luck if we\r\ncannot intercept one or another of them.\"\r\n\r\nBut although I spoke so confidently I am afraid that I was not very\r\nsuccessful in cheering up my companions in misfortune.  This second\r\ndisappointment was producing its effect upon them; they were becoming\r\ndepressed and pessimistic; and although they all agreed that the proper\r\nthing to do was to hang on to the distant barque, in the hope of\r\neventually attracting the attention of somebody aboard her, I could see\r\nthat we were all fully convinced that the attempt would result in\r\nfailure.\r\n\r\nAnd so it did.  We chased that barque until the sun set and the shades\r\nof night hid her from our sight; and although about mid-afternoon we got\r\nso close to her that her lower yards showed above the horizon when she\r\nlifted on the swell, and kept the telescope bearing upon her all the\r\ntime, no more hands were sent aloft, and as the afternoon progressed she\r\nsteadily drew away from us again, until when at length we lost sight of\r\nher in the gathering darkness only her royals and the upper halves of\r\nher topgallantsails were showing above the horizon.  And all this time\r\nso absorbed were we in the chase that we were scarcely conscious of the\r\nfact that the wind was steadily freshening every minute, the result\r\nbeing that, when at length we were compelled to abandon the hope of\r\nbeing seen and picked up, we suddenly awoke to the fact that it was\r\nblowing quite a strong breeze, and that it had kicked up such a high,\r\nsteep sea that it was no longer possible for us to round-to and ride to\r\na sea anchor as we had done on the night but one before.  We were\r\ntherefore obliged to scud before the wind all night under whole canvas,\r\nto avoid being pooped and swamped by the breaking seas that\r\nremorselessly chased us.\r\n\r\nThat was a harassing, anxious night for all hands of us, for by midnight\r\nit was blowing what is generally termed a fresh gale, that is, a breeze\r\nstrong enough to compel a ship of, say, a thousand tons to reduce canvas\r\nto single-reefed topsails; and that, to us, in a small open boat, was\r\nabout equivalent to what a hurricane would be to the bigger craft.\r\nThere was no sleep for any of us, for we were in constant, imminent\r\ndanger, and it taxed the resources of all hands to their utmost limit\r\nall through the night to keep the boat from being overwhelmed.  The\r\nchief danger to an open boat under such circumstances arises from the\r\nfact that, lying so low in the water as she does, her sail becomes\r\nbecalmed every time that she settles into the trough of a sea, and she\r\ngradually loses way.  Then, as she is hove up on the breast of the next\r\nfollowing sea, her sail suddenly fills again, and those in her have to\r\nbe careful that, in filling, it does not jibe over, for if it did so it\r\nwould certainly capsize the boat.  But in guarding against that danger\r\nanother of equal magnitude is incurred, for unless the boat is kept dead\r\nstern-on to the sea the chances are that she will broach-to and be\r\nfilled by the breaking head of the sea when it overtakes her.  When it\r\ncomes to be remembered that this twofold peril threatens an open boat\r\nabout twice a minute hour after hour, as long as the gale continues,\r\nsome faint idea may be gained of the anxiety and discomfort we were\r\ncalled upon to endure on the occasion which I am now attempting to\r\ndescribe.  And while the anxiety of all is sufficiently acute, the man\r\nwho is most worried is the one who is at the helm, for the behaviour of\r\na craft under such circumstances is in one respect distinctly and\r\nharassingly peculiar: at the most perilous moment of all, which is the\r\nmoment before she is actually overtaken by the breaking crest of the\r\nwave, she is apt to refuse to answer her helm, and he who is steering\r\nher loses all control over her; she seems to be seized with a perverse\r\ndetermination to take a broad sheer one way or the other, with\r\ndisastrous results, despite a hard-over helm, and then the only thing to\r\nbe done to retrieve the situation is to effect a lightning shift of helm\r\nagainst all your past experience and your better judgment.  But\r\nnotwithstanding this, it generally has the desired effect, the reason\r\ncommonly assigned being that, contrary to what is usually supposed, the\r\nbody of water constituting the head of a sea actually has a quick\r\nforward motion, and when this overtakes a craft, large or small, which\r\nis only beginning to gather fresh headway, the result is practically the\r\nsame as though she were going astern instead of ahead, and the helm must\r\nbe manipulated accordingly.  Whether this is really the true explanation\r\nof the curiously awkward phenomenon of which I have spoken I cannot say;\r\nbut I know that the phenomenon occurs, and that it placed us in\r\nthe direst peril at least half a hundred times during that\r\nnever-to-be-forgotten night, a peril from which, it appeared to me, we\r\neach time escaped by the very skin of our teeth, and by what seemed to\r\nbe nothing short of a series of miracles.  True, we are told that the\r\ndays of miracles are long past; but, after all, who knows?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER FIVE.\r\n\r\nTHE \"MARTHA BROWN\" OF BALTIMORE.\r\n\r\nAll through the night, and until nearly noon next day, were we compelled\r\nto continue scudding before the gale; and a pretty crew of scarecrows we\r\nlooked when the morning at length dawned and disclosed us to each\r\nother's vision, drenched to the skin with flying spray, haggard and\r\nred-eyed with fatigue and the want of sleep, and each wearing that\r\npeculiar and indescribable expression of countenance that marks the man\r\nwho has been face to face for hours with imminent death.  But about four\r\nbells in the forenoon watch the gale suddenly broke, the sky cleared,\r\nand the wind moderated so rapidly that just before noon, by carefully\r\nwatching our opportunity, we were at length able to round-to and once\r\nmore ride to our makeshift sea anchor.  Then, the boat riding dry--that\r\nis to say, shipping no water--we baled her out, and next proceeded to\r\noverhaul our stock of provisions, with the object of ascertaining what\r\ndamage, if any, it had sustained through the constant drenching of the\r\nseas to which we had been exposed.  Our bread--or biscuit--and water\r\nwere all that we were really anxious about, the remainder being packed\r\nin tins, jars, or bottles, and it was a great relief to us to find that,\r\nthanks to the precautions which we had taken, nothing had suffered to\r\nany very serious extent.\r\n\r\nThen I went to work to calculate our position as nearly as I could,\r\nalthough the roughness of my data rendered it exceedingly difficult to\r\narrive anywhere near the mark; but at length, by patient and careful\r\nfiguring, I reached the exceedingly unsatisfactory conclusion that not\r\nonly had we lost all the ground previously gained, but we were somewhere\r\nabout thirty miles south of the spot where Bainbridge had sent us\r\nadrift!\r\n\r\nAnd then our thoughts turned to the longboat, and we began to ask\r\nourselves and each other how she had fared.  We were still afloat, it is\r\ntrue, but only because of our long-continued and almost superhuman\r\nexertions, while our boat was an exceptionally good one and by no means\r\noverloaded.  How it would be with our consort, overcrowded with\r\nhelpless, terror-stricken women and children, and perilously deep in the\r\nwater, we scarcely dared to think; for, with the recollection of what we\r\nhad recently passed through still vivid in our minds, we had little\r\ndifficulty in conjuring up a very graphic picture of what would be the\r\nstate of affairs aboard the longboat under the same circumstances.  Of\r\ncourse there was the possibility that, more fortunate than ourselves,\r\nshe had been seen and her party rescued by a passing ship; but, failing\r\nthat, we felt that we dared not entertain the slightest hope that she\r\nstill survived.  No good end, however, was to be served by speculating\r\nupon the possibilities of disaster to our friends.  We therefore\r\nproceeded to get a meal as soon as we had straightened up matters as far\r\nas was possible; and while we ate and drank we discussed the important\r\nquestion of what we should do next.  Our recent experiences had been of\r\nsuch a character as to convince us that our prospects of reaching Rio\r\nbefore our stock of provisions should be consumed--if ever--were\r\nexceedingly slight.  On the other hand, we had already had ocular\r\ndemonstration of the fact that we were not far from the track of\r\nsouth-bound craft; we therefore eventually arrived unanimously at the\r\nconclusion that, taking all things into consideration, the best thing we\r\ncould do was to cruise to the northward, in the hope that within the\r\nnext few days we should be fortunate enough to fall in with some vessel\r\nthe skipper of which would be humane enough to pick us up and perhaps\r\nland us at the nearest port.\r\n\r\nIt was so near sunset before the sea moderated sufficiently to enable us\r\nagain to make sail that we ultimately determined to remain as we were,\r\nriding to our sea anchor all night, in order that all hands might have\r\nthe opportunity to secure a good night's rest before resuming our battle\r\nwith wind and sea.  For after all, now that we had definitely abandoned\r\nthe idea of attempting to make Rio, or indeed any part of the South\r\nAmerican coast, it did not greatly matter whether we were under way or\r\nnot; a ship was just as likely to come along and find us where we then\r\nwere as anywhere else.  And although we had resolved to take a night's\r\nrest before resuming our struggle, we of course intended to keep an\r\nanchor watch of one hand, who would look after the weather and the boat\r\nand also otherwise maintain a sharp lookout, so that, in the event of a\r\nsail heaving in sight, she should not be permitted to slip past us\r\nwithout an effort on our part to intercept her.\r\n\r\nThe night passed uneventfully, wind and sea gradually moderating all\r\nthrough the hours of darkness, until, by the dawn of the following day,\r\nboth had so far gone down that we could once more make sail upon the gig\r\nwith perfect safety.  It is true that there was still a rather heavy\r\nswell running, but even that was fast diminishing, and there was no sea\r\nto speak of, the wind being of the strength known to sailors as a\r\n\"royal\" breeze, that is to say, a wind of so moderate a force that a\r\nship of ordinary size could show her royals to it.\r\n\r\nThe sailmaker's watch ended a few minutes after sunrise, and when he\r\ncalled the rest of us our first business was to wash the sleep out of\r\nour eyes by dipping our heads into a bucket of clear, sparkling salt\r\nwater, dipped up from over the side; after which we proceeded to perform\r\nour toilets as well as our very limited resources permitted, the next\r\nthing in order being breakfast.  And while this was being prepared--the\r\npreparation consisting merely in the apportioning to each individual of\r\nhis just and proper allowance of food--Simpson shinned up to the\r\nmasthead to take a look round the horizon, and thus enable us to get the\r\nearliest possible intimation of the approach of a ship, should one\r\nchance to be in our neighbourhood.\r\n\r\nThe man had scarcely reached his perch--which, after all, was only about\r\nsix feet above our heads when we stood up--when he emitted a joyous yell\r\nof:\r\n\r\n\"Sail ho!  Hurrah, my bullies, here she comes, pretty nigh straight down\r\nfor us, if these eyes of mine ain't deceivin' of me!\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you make her out to be, Sails?\"  I demanded.\r\n\r\n\"Can't tell yet, sir,\" answered Simpson.  \"All as I can see just at\r\npresent is the head of a--well, it may be a royal, or it may be the head\r\nof the to'garns'l of a schooner.  And I'm inclined to think it's a\r\nschooner, because it looks sharp and clear like, as though it wasn't so\r\nvery far off.  Yes, I reckon that there blessed bit of white ain't much\r\nmore'n ten mile away.\"\r\n\r\n\"And how does she bear?\"  I asked.\r\n\r\n\"Dead to wind'ard as ever she can be,\" was the cheering reply.  \"And\r\nheadin' for us just as straight as she can come.  Hurrah, my buckos!\r\nThere's no mistake about it this time; she's boun' to pick us up, unless\r\nshe happens to be another of them there puddin'-headed Portugees what\r\ndon't seem to believe in pickin' up pore shipwrecked mariners,\" Sails\r\nended, with a sudden note of disgust in his voice.\r\n\r\n\"Portugee or no Portugee, she will pick us up; I'll see to that,\" said\r\nI.  \"We'll not give her the chance to refuse; we'll just lie doggo where\r\nwe are until she is within a mile or two of us, and then we'll up lug\r\nand run her aboard, whether her people like it or not.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ay, ay, that's your sort, Mr Temple,\" agreed the boatswain.  \"No more\r\nslippin' past and wavin' hands for me; if they don't want to pick us up,\r\nwe'll just have to make 'em, that's all.  I've had enough of boat\r\nsailin' to last me for the rest of me bloomin' life, and enough of\r\nsleepin' on thwarts, too.  I means to sleep in a dry fo'c'sle to-night\r\nin spite of all the Portugee swines in creation.\"\r\n\r\n\"All right, Simpson,\" I hailed.  \"You had better come down now and get\r\nyour breakfast.  By the time that we have finished, yonder craft will be\r\nvisible to all of us, and then we shall be able to judge what is best to\r\nbe done.\"\r\n\r\nWe made a good hearty breakfast that morning, both eating and drinking a\r\nlittle more than our strict allowance, I am afraid, for we all seemed to\r\nbe possessed of the same undoubted conviction that, with the appearance\r\nof the stranger to windward, our troubles were now all over, and that\r\ntherefore the necessity to husband our limited resources carefully no\r\nlonger existed.\r\n\r\nThe strange sail appeared to be a fairly fast craft, for before we had\r\nquite finished our breakfast the head of her canvas appeared above the\r\nhorizon to us, even though we were still sitting upon the thwarts, and\r\nwe immediately brought Cunningham's telescope to bear upon her.  The\r\nfirst glimpse that I caught of her through the lenses satisfied me that\r\nshe was a small vessel, the quickness and violence of her movements--for\r\nshe was rolling heavily--bearing unmistakable evidence of that fact; and\r\nten minutes later we discovered her to be topsail-schooner rigged.  She\r\nwas evidently making the utmost of the fair wind, for she had topmast\r\nand lower studdingsails set on both sides; and she was coming dead down\r\nthe wind direct for us.  We waited patiently where we were until she had\r\nrisen hull-up, revealing herself through the telescope as a very\r\nhandsome, smart-looking little schooner, with very white sails, which\r\nlooked as though made of cotton canvas; and then we got our sea anchor\r\ninboard, cast the oars adrift in readiness for instant use should we\r\nneed them, and got under way, working the boat to and fro in short tacks\r\nimmediately athwart the schooner's hawse, while Simpson stood on a\r\nthwart to windward, waving a rag to attract attention, the boatswain\r\nmeanwhile keeping the telescope steadfastly bearing upon the approaching\r\ncraft.\r\n\r\nWe had just tacked for the second time when Murdock, with his eyes still\r\nglued to the telescope, shouted:\r\n\r\n\"They see us! they see us!  There's a couple of chaps standin' by her\r\nstarboard cathead lookin' at us under the sharp of their hands.  And now\r\none of 'em has turned round and is looking aft; he's reportin' of us to\r\nthe hofficer of the watch, he is--I can see him hollerin' with one hand\r\nto the side of his mouth while he p'ints with the other.  Yes; and now\r\nthere's another chap runnin' for'ard to join the first two; he'll be the\r\nmate, I reckon--or p'rhaps the skipper.  And now the third man's lookin'\r\nat us too.  Keep on wavin', Sails; don't let there be no mistake about\r\nwhat we wants.  The third man's runnin' aft again.  He's goin' to call\r\nthe Old Man, I reckon.\"  A pause of about half a minute ensued, and then\r\nthe boatswain resumed:\r\n\r\n\"No, he ain't; he's gone aft to get his glass.  Yes, that's it; and now\r\nhe's bringin' it to bear upon us.  Wave, Sails, wave, you skowbank, for\r\nall you're worth.  Yes; that's--Hurrah! it's all right, bullies, they're\r\nnot agoin' to leave us behind; they're chaps of the right sort, they\r\nare!  See that, Mr Temple?  There's in stuns'ls; they're agoin' to\r\nshorten sail and round-to, to pick us up.  But they seem to be\r\nthunderin' short-handed.  They'll be past us and away to loo'ard long\r\nafore they can get them stuns'ls in.  Better bear up and run down afore\r\nit, hadn't we, sir, so's not to keep 'em waitin'?\"\r\n\r\nThe suggestion was a good one, for they had at least two studdingsails--\r\nthose set on the starboard side--to take in before they could round-to,\r\nand from the rate at which they were getting the first in I could see\r\nthat, as Murdock had said, the little vessel would run past us before\r\nthey could get in the other.  So I put up the helm and bore away, easing\r\noff the sheet, and when we were running off square before the wind I\r\nbegan to edge the boat gradually in toward the line of the schooner's\r\ncourse.  By this manoeuvre we gave them a little more time to shorten\r\nsail, since we were still about a mile ahead of them and were now\r\ntravelling in the same direction as themselves, although the schooner\r\nwas fast overhauling us.  But by the time that she was abreast of us,\r\nand only about a hundred feet distant, both her starboard studdingsails\r\nwere in, and she was ready to round-to.  Then a man came to the rail and\r\nhailed us.\r\n\r\n\"Boat ahoy!\" he shouted.  \"I guess you're shipwrecked, ain't you, and\r\nwant to be picked up.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ay, ay, sir,\" I answered; \"that is so.  May we run alongside?\"\r\n\r\n\"Sure!\" he replied heartily.  \"I'll come to the wind on the starboard\r\ntack, when you can pass under my starn and come alongside at the lee\r\ngangway.\"\r\n\r\nI waved my hand by way of thanks and to show that I understood, and let\r\nrun the sheet of the lug to allow him to draw ahead and take room to\r\nround-to; and presently he eased down his helm and brought the schooner\r\nto the wind, keeping his yards square and hauling his jib sheets over to\r\nwindward to check the little vessel's way.  We were thus afforded an\r\nexcellent view of the craft, and a little beauty she was, as clean built\r\nand finely modelled as a yacht--for which, indeed, she might easily have\r\nbeen mistaken, except for the fact that her sails were not big enough.\r\nShe was painted all black from her rail to her copper, with the bust of\r\na woman, painted white, for a figurehead, and the name _Martha Brown_,\r\nwith the word Baltimore--her port of registry--painted in white letters\r\non her stern.  She appeared to be in little more than deep-ballast trim,\r\nand I began to wonder whither she was bound even before we got alongside\r\nher.\r\n\r\nThe getting alongside required a little management, for there was a fair\r\namount of swell running, and the schooner was rolling heavily; but we\r\nmanaged it all right, and were met at the gangway, upon boarding the\r\nlittle vessel, by the individual who had hailed us.  He was a typical\r\nYankee, tall, thin, and somewhat cadaverous-looking as to features, with\r\na clean-shaven upper lip, a short goatee beard, and light hair, slightly\r\ntouched with grey, worn so long that it came down over the collar of his\r\ncoat, which was of faded blue cloth, adorned with brass buttons.  His\r\ntrousers were braced up high enough to reveal his ankles, and he wore a\r\npair of ancient red morocco slippers upon his otherwise naked feet.  His\r\nhead was adorned with a peakless cap of what looked like wolfskin,\r\nfitted with a pair of flaps to tie down over the ears, but now fastened\r\ntogether at the crown.\r\n\r\nAlthough the man presented a distinctly quaint ensemble, there was a\r\ngenial, kindly twinkle in his eyes that caused me to take to him on the\r\nspot as he extended his hand and said, with a slight drawl and a strong\r\nYankee accent:\r\n\r\n\"Walcome, strangers, to the _Marthy Brown_.  I guess you've been havin'\r\na rough time by the looks of you.  How long, now, have ye been knockin'\r\nabout in that boat?\"\r\n\r\n\"This is our fifth day in her, Mr--er--er--\" I answered.\r\n\r\n\"I reckon you're gropin' around after my name, Mister,\" he interrupted.\r\n\"It's Ephraim Brown--very ginerally razeed down to Eph by my friends--\r\nand I'm master and owner of this here schooner, named a'ter my old woman\r\naway back to Baltimore.  I guess your name is--\"\r\n\r\n\"Mark Temple,\" I hastened to reply.  \"My companions are respectively Mr\r\nEdward Cunningham, late a cuddy passenger aboard the British barque\r\n_Zenobia_--of which vessel I was one of the apprentices; William\r\nMurdock, boatswain; Joseph Parsons, carpenter; and James Simpson,\r\nsailmaker, all of the same ship.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm downright glad to meet you all,\" replied Mr Ephraim Brown, shaking\r\nhands all round again with much cordiality.  Then he stepped to the\r\ntaffrail and looked down at the gig, which had been passed astern.\r\n\r\n\"I guess that's a very tidy-lookin' boat of yourn, and there don't seem\r\nto be nothin' partic'lar the matter with her.  I reckon she's quite\r\nworth hoistin' in, ain't she, Mister?\" he remarked.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, indeed she is,\" I replied.  \"She has brought us safely through\r\nsome pretty heavy weather, and I should be very sorry to see her cast\r\nadrift.\"\r\n\r\n\"Cast adrift nothin'!  That ain't old Eph Brown's way,\" retorted the\r\nskipper briskly.  \"Is she very heavy?\"\r\n\r\n\"On the contrary, she is an exceedingly light boat when empty,\" I\r\nreplied.\r\n\r\n\"Ah!\" remarked my interlocutor.  \"Then I guess we'll have all that\r\nstuff--your stock of provisions, I reckon--out of her, and then we'll\r\nunship the lee gangway and run her inboard fisherman fashion.  It'll be\r\nquicker than riggin' tackles; and I'm in an almighty big hurry.\"  He\r\nfaced forward and hailed a couple of his men.  \"You, Sam and Pete, lay\r\naft here and lend a hand to get the stuff out of this boat.\"\r\n\r\n\"But there is no need to trouble your people, Captain,\" I interrupted.\r\n\"We will empty her ourselves in a brace of shakes.  Murdock and Chips,\r\njust jump down into the gig and pass those things out of her.  Haul her\r\nclose up under the counter, and we will pass you down a rope's end over\r\nthe taffrail to sling them to.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I guess that'll do the trick,\" agreed the skipper.  \"And you, Sam\r\nand Pete,\" he continued, turning to the two men who still lingered,\r\n\"turn-to and unship the lee gangway, ready to run the boat inboard when\r\nshe's cleared.  We'll stow her, right side up, alongside of the\r\nlongboat.\"\r\n\r\nA quarter of an hour later saw the gig hauled inboard and snugly stowed,\r\nafter which the _Martha Brown_ was kept away upon her course and the\r\nstuddingsails were rehoisted, our boatswain, carpenter, and sailmaker\r\nlending a hand, while Cunningham and I remained aft, chatting with our\r\nnew friend.  As the last rope was belayed the skipper stepped to the\r\nskylight, peered down through it, and then turned and struck eight\r\nbells.  Almost immediately afterward a lad emerged from the cabin\r\ncompanion, went forward to the little galley, and presently reappeared\r\nbearing a large covered dish in one hand and a capacious coffee-pot in\r\nthe other.\r\n\r\n\"Aha!\" exclaimed Brown, smacking his lips in anticipation, \"breakfast;\r\nand I guess it smells good.  Now I reckon that you 'uns have been upon\r\npretty short commons this last few days, and'll be in good shape to\r\nenj'y a square meal.  I guess you two'll have to mess in the cabin along\r\no' me; the hands for'ard'll look a'ter the rest of your crowd.\"\r\n\r\nAt the skipper's invitation Cunningham and I forthwith followed him\r\nbelow to an exceeding small but very comfortable cabin, upon the tiny\r\ntable of which was set out a quite unexpectedly enticing meal, to which\r\nBrown helped us both with most hospitable liberality.  For a little\r\nwhile we ate and drank in silence; but presently, when we had taken the\r\nkeen edge off our appetites, our kindly host asked for details of the\r\ncircumstances under which we had come to be knocking about in mid-ocean\r\nin an open boat.\r\n\r\n\"Waal, I'll be sugared!\" he ejaculated, after I had related to him in\r\ndetail the incidents connected with the seizure of the _Zenobia_ by her\r\ncrew, under the leadership of Bainbridge; \"if that don't beat\r\neverything!  And you say that the skunk means to set up in business as a\r\npirate?  But is this here barque of yourn armed?  Do she mount any guns?\r\nBecause, if she don't, how do that crowd of toughs reckon they're goin'\r\nto hold up and rob a ship?\"\r\n\r\nI shrugged my shoulders.  \"I haven't the slightest notion,\" I replied;\r\n\"but, knowing Bainbridge so well as I do, I have no doubt that he has a\r\nscheme of some sort in his head.\"\r\n\r\n\"Waal,\" agreed the skipper, \"if he's pretty cute he may p'rhaps bluff a\r\nskipper or two; but I guess he'll very soon be euchred--a man-o'-war'll\r\nnab him afore he can say `Jack Robinson'.  And now,\" he continued,\r\n\"about you 'uns.  From things said while you was spinnin' that yarn of\r\nthe mutiny I seemed to get a sort of notion that you'd like me to put ye\r\nashore as soon as possible.  Is that the idee?\"\r\n\r\n\"Precisely,\" I said.  \"Mr Cunningham, here, naturally wishes to return\r\nto England with as little delay as may be; and as for myself, I am\r\nequally anxious, because, until I can get into touch with the owners of\r\nthe _Zenobia_, and be placed by them in another ship, I am losing time.\"\r\n\r\n\"I see,\" commented the skipper meditatively; \"yes, I reckon I kinder\r\nunderstand the situation.  By the by, did you say, just now, that you\r\nwas a purty good navigator, or did I only fancy it?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't remember having exactly said such a thing,\" I replied; \"but\r\npossibly I may have implied as much.  Anyhow, I think I am justified in\r\nsaying that I am navigator enough to take a ship from any one part of\r\nthe world to any other.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah!\" returned the skipper; \"I had an idee that I'd understood as much.\r\nNow, then, just listen to me.  I guess I can't put ye ashore until we\r\narrives at Punta Arenas, away down there in the Magellan Straits,\r\nbecause the solid fact is that I'm in a most tarnation, all-fired hurry\r\nto get into the Pacific.  Of course I'll be very willin' to tranship ye\r\ninto a homeward-bounder, if we happens to fall in with one--and you\r\nreally wants to go.  But I've been thinkin' matters over a bit while\r\nwe've been talkin', and I've a proposition to make that maybe'll suit ye\r\njust as well as goin' back to the old country.  I s'pose you've noticed\r\nthat I haven't got nary a mate with me?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" I confessed, \"to tell you the truth, I've been wondering how it\r\nis that I have not yet seen him.\"\r\n\r\n\"You ha'n't seen him because I guess he ain't here to see,\" remarked the\r\nskipper.  \"I been unfort'nit in the matter o' mates this trip,\" he\r\ncontinued.  \"My reg'lar mate what always sails with me is my nevvy,\r\nAbr'am Brown, as slick a youngster as ever I wish to see.  But he met\r\nwith an accident the day before we sailed; trod on a banana peel, fell\r\nawk'ardly, broke his right leg, had to go to the hospital, and I had to\r\nlook round in a hurry for somebody to take his place.  Got a chap that\r\nlooked all right; but we hadn't been to sea above forty-eight hours when\r\nhe made a bad break--got so tarnation drunk that I couldn't get him out\r\nof his bunk for a night and a day.  And a'ter that he kept on soakin' on\r\nthe sly--though where he got the liquor from I couldn't find out to save\r\nmy life--until things come to such a pass that if it hadn't been that I\r\nwas in such a tarnation hurry I'd have put in somewhere and fired him.\r\nWisht I had, now.  But I didn't; and the end of it was that he went\r\ncrazy, jumped overboard, and was drowned, one dark night when we'd been\r\nout just three weeks.\r\n\r\n\"Now, my proposition is this.  You look real smart, and are a good\r\nnavigator, while I'm short of a mate.  If you care to accept the\r\nposition I'll sign ye on at the same rate of pay--namely, thirty dollars\r\na month--that the other chap was gettin'.  Now, what d'ye say?\"\r\n\r\n\"But I don't even know yet where you are bound for, or what is the\r\nprobable duration of the voyage,\" I objected.  \"Naturally I should like\r\nto know these particulars before binding myself.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sure,\" agreed the skipper, in nowise offended at my apparent\r\nhesitation.  \"Well then,\" he continued, \"I'm boun' for a certain spot in\r\nthe Pacific, for a certain very partic'lar reason: and if you agree to\r\nsign on I'll tell ye the reason, and just exactly where the spot is; but\r\nif you don't sign on it won't matter to you where I'm goin', or what I'm\r\nout after.  That's one of the reasons for this here v'yage.  T'other is\r\nto trade off a lot of truck what I've got down below, for sandalwood.\r\nAnd when I've got a full cargo of the wood I propose to go on to Canton,\r\nsell it, and buy tea with the proceeds; said tea to be sold in due\r\ncourse at New York, where the v'yage will end.  And I reckon that the\r\ntrip'll run into all of eight or nine months.\"\r\n\r\n\"And a jolly fine trip it will be,\" remarked Cunningham.  \"I wish I had\r\nyour chance, Temple; I would take it like a shot.\"\r\n\r\n\"You don't say?\" remarked the skipper, eyeing Cunningham earnestly.\r\n\"But then, you see, you ain't a sailor,\" he observed.\r\n\r\n\"No, that is very true,\" returned Cunningham.  \"By profession I am a\r\ncivil engineer.  But I am also a keen yachtsman; and I know something\r\nmore than the rudiments of navigation.  But of course,\" he added\r\nhastily, \"I have not the qualifications which would fit me for the berth\r\nthat you are offering to Temple.\"\r\n\r\n\"N-o; I reckon not,\" agreed the skipper meditatively.  \"Still--p'rhaps I\r\nmight be able to find a use for ye--if ye cared to come along--upon such\r\nterms as I could see my way to offer ye.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" remarked Cunningham, with a laugh, \"we can discuss that later\r\non--if Temple accepts your offer.\"\r\n\r\nMeanwhile I had been thinking rapidly.  There was no very especial\r\nreason why I should return to England at once, for I had no relatives to\r\nbe anxious over my disappearance, the only individuals who were in the\r\nleast interested in me being my late father's trustees, to whom I could\r\nwrite from Punta Arenas.  Then the voyage of the _Martha Brown_, as\r\nsketched by her skipper, rather appealed to me; sandalwood collecting\r\nmeant a call at several of the South Sea Islands, and the South Sea\r\nIslands and romance were synonymous terms with me at that time.  Also,\r\nthe pay was good, exceptionally good for such a berth as that of mate of\r\na ninety-ton schooner; and although I should probably sacrifice my\r\nindentures, that was a matter that gave me very little concern.\r\nAltogether I felt very strongly disposed to close with Brown's offer,\r\nthe only really serious obstacle in the way being the fact that I felt I\r\nhad a duty to perform to the three seamen who had formed part of our\r\nlittle company in the gig.  First-rate fellows they were, all three of\r\nthem, knowing their vocation to its smallest detail, and thoroughly at\r\nhome aboard a ship in blue water, though ashore they were as guileless\r\nand helpless as babes, ready to fall an easy prey to the first land\r\nshark that got scent of them.  If I could be sure of arranging at Punta\r\nArenas for their conveyance to England, either as shipwrecked seamen or\r\notherwise, and thus discharging my responsibility so far as they were\r\nconcerned, I would not hesitate for a moment.  I decided to put the\r\nmatter to the skipper, and did so, there and then.\r\n\r\n\"Ah!\" he said, \"I was goin' to speak to you about them there men of\r\nyourn.  D'ye think they'd be inclined to sign on with me for this here\r\nv'yage?\"\r\n\r\n\"Really, I do not know in the least,\" I replied, regarding him with\r\nastonishment.  \"If you like I will--\"\r\n\r\n\"It's like this, you see,\" he interrupted me, no doubt observing my look\r\nof surprise.  \"There's six hands in this here schooner's fo'c'sle--three\r\nto each watch; and when I shipped 'em I reckoned that with me, the mate,\r\nthe cook, and the cabin boy there'd be plenty of us for all the work\r\nwe'd have to do.  But just when we was startin'--we was actually castin'\r\noff the warps at the time--a letter was handed to me that, bein' busy\r\njust then, I put into my pocket and forgot all about until a couple of\r\ndays a'terwards, when we'd cleared Cape Henry and was fairly out to sea.\r\nThen, while I was goin' through my pockets, huntin' for something else,\r\nI comes across this here letter, and opened it.  And I tell you, Mister,\r\nthat there was news in it that made me sit up and feel mighty anxious\r\nall of a sudden to get away round to the Pacific as quick as possible.\r\nAnd it made me feel, too, that I wisht I had three or four more men\r\nalong.  So if your chaps are willin' to sign on with me I'll be glad to\r\nhave 'em.  Pay--well, they're good men, you tell me--say, twenty a\r\nmonth.\"\r\n\r\nI glanced forward and saw that all three of the men were on deck,\r\nsmoking, and chatting with the two hands who, with the man at the wheel,\r\nconstituted the watch.\r\n\r\n\"They are on deck, I see,\" said I.  \"If you like I will mention your\r\nproposal to them, and see how they take it.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll take it very kindly if you will, Mister,\" answered the skipper;\r\nand without more ado I beckoned them to join me in the waist, where I\r\nlaid the skipper's offer before them, while the Old Man himself and\r\nCunningham remained chatting animatedly together close by the companion,\r\nwhere much of the foregoing conversation had taken place upon our\r\nadjournment from the breakfast table.\r\n\r\nI soon found that, with the careless, happy-go-lucky temperament of the\r\nBritish merchant sailor, all three men were perfectly willing to ship\r\nfor the voyage--about which they had already heard something from the\r\nforecastle hands with whom they had been fraternising--especially when I\r\ntold them that I had been offered the position of mate and felt strongly\r\ndisposed to accept it; and accordingly I led them aft there and then,\r\nand informed the skipper that we all accepted his offer, and without\r\nfurther ado we went below and signed articles.\r\n\r\nWhen, after signing, we all returned to the deck, and the three English\r\nseamen had gone forward, Cunningham came up to me and said, laughingly:\r\n\r\n\"You will be interested to learn, Temple, that our worthy friend here,\r\nCaptain Brown, has also offered me a post, which I have accepted.  As\r\nnearly as I can define it, the position is that of honorary second mate;\r\nit carries with it no pay, but in lieu of that I am to be perfectly free\r\nto leave the schooner whenever I please, and am to live in the cabin,\r\nreceive cabin rations, and obtain, free of cost, an entirely new outfit\r\nof clothes from the slop chest.  What do you think of my bargain?\"\r\n\r\n\"I consider it a very fair one,\" said I, \"with perhaps a slight\r\nadvantage in favour of the skipper.  For although of course he could\r\ndoubtless do perfectly well without you, your grub and a new rig-out\r\nwill not cost him very much; and in return for that he will get--as long\r\nas you choose to remain with us--the ability to sleep in all night with\r\na perfectly easy mind: for I can assure the captain,\" and I here turned\r\nto that individual, who was standing by, intently listening to all that\r\nwas said, \"that although you are not a professional seaman you are quite\r\nsailor enough to take care of this schooner during your watch.  Also you\r\nare a man of intellect and education, well-read, musical, and with an\r\ninexhaustible fund of intensely interesting conversation, so that I\r\nthink Captain Brown will find in you a very agreeable companion.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ay, ay, you've just hit it, Temple,\" cut in the skipper.  \"That's just\r\nwhat I thought when I was listenin' to you two fellers talkin' at\r\nbreakfast-time.  Says I to myself: `Now, here's two chaps with the\r\nspeech and manners of gentlefolks, chaps as can hold their own with\r\nanybody when it comes to talkin', and yet they're sailors too--at least\r\none of 'em is; and if you, Eph Brown, what have never had no more\r\neddication than what you could pick up, could only persuade them two to\r\njine yer in this here v'yage, you'd have such a chance as you've never\r\nhad before to learn gentlefolks' manners, to talk proper, and ginerally\r\nto comport yourself in such a fashion as'd make your dear old Marthy fit\r\nto bust herself with pride to see and hear ye when ye get back home\r\nagain, 'specially as you hopes to strike it rich this trip.'  So there\r\nyou are, gents: you can call me Cap'n as often as you likes--it sounds\r\ngood, and makes me feel as though I was some punkins--but otherwise I'd\r\nlike you to talk to me and behave to me just as if we was all eq'als;\r\nand whenever you hear me makin' a bad slip up in the matter of language,\r\nI'll take it very kindly of ye if you'll just pull me up with a round\r\nturn and p'int out where I've gone wrong.\"\r\n\r\nIt was rather an amusing proposal, certainly, for a shipmaster to make\r\nto his officers, but the old fellow was so transparently frank in\r\nrecognising his shortcomings, and so earnestly anxious to have them\r\nremedied, that both Cunningham and I entered quite heartily into the\r\nspirit of the thing, and readily undertook to do everything that lay in\r\nour power to polish up his manners and speech in readiness for the\r\nsurprise which he proposed to spring upon his \"dear old Marthy\" upon his\r\nreturn to Baltimore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER SIX.\r\n\r\nSKIPPER BROWN RELATES A REMARKABLE STORY.\r\n\r\n\"And now, gents,\" said the skipper, when we had satisfactorily arranged\r\nthe important and rather delicate matter referring to the improvement of\r\nhis speech and deportment, \"I'm sorter hankerin' to have a talk with you\r\nboth about that there letter I was tellin' you of a while ago--the\r\nletter that was handed to me just as we was makin' a start from\r\nBaltimore, and that I forgot all about until we was fairly out to sea.\r\n\r\n\"This here letter told me--But stop a bit; if I want you to understand\r\nthe thing properly, and I surely do, I guess I'll have to give you the\r\nwhole history of it from the very beginnin'.  Along about three months\r\nago, just after I'd got home from my last v'yage, I happened to have a\r\nbit of business to attend to that called for a trip over to New York;\r\nand when I'd got through with what I had to do, the fancy took me to\r\nstay over for a day or two and have a look round, me not havin' been in\r\nNew York for quite a number of years before, you'll understand.  And\r\nwhile I was doin' my lookin' around I must needs go nosin', like a fool,\r\ndown into the Bowery.  And down there I runs up agin a ragged skeleton\r\nthat looks me hard in the face and hails me with: `Hello, Eph Brown,\r\nwhat cheer?  Blamed if you ain't the very chap that I've been most\r\nwantin' to see.'\r\n\r\n\"I guess I was pretty well struck of a heap, for I didn't reckernise the\r\nchap from Adam; all I noticed was that he didn't seem to ha' had a bath\r\nsince his mother give him one as a baby, that he was dressed in clo'es\r\nthat ought by rights to have belonged to a scarecrow, that he was that\r\nthin and cadaverous he might have just escaped from the Morgue, and that\r\nhis breath was reekin' of cheap whisky.\r\n\r\n\"`Now, who in Tom Hawkins may you be?' says I; for, you see, the feller\r\nknowed my name all right, yet, seein' where we was, and what the man\r\nlooked like, I sorter suspicioned that he wasn't exactly square, and was\r\ntryin' to get at me.\r\n\r\n\"`What!' he says; `d'ye mean to say as ye don't remember me--Abe\r\nJohnson--what used to play with yer in the old days when we was boys\r\ntogether away in dear old Nantucket?'--Nantucket, you'll understand,\r\ngents, bein' the place where I was born.\r\n\r\n\"`No,' says I, `I don't, and that's the cold, solid truth.  But if\r\nyou're really Abe Johnson you'll remember the names of a few people in\r\nNantucket, and a few of the things that we done together.  Where, f'r\r\ninstance, did I live when you knew me?'\r\n\r\n\"Well, he told me where I lived, give me the names of a lot of people\r\nthat we both used to know, and reminded me of a good many things that we\r\ndone together that I'd clean forgot all about until he mentioned 'em.\r\nOh yes, he was Abe, sure; and when he see that he'd satisfied me upon\r\nthat p'int, he told me a real downright pitiful tale, and struck me for\r\nten dollars.  He was right away down on his luck, he said; and I guess\r\nhe was speakin' the truth, if looks went for anything.\r\n\r\n\"Now, Abe never had amounted to much when I knew him; he was just a\r\nlow-down, ornery cuss every way that you looked at him.  But I was\r\nal'ays a bit tender-hearted, and I sorter pitied the feller; so a'ter I\r\npassed over the ten-spot to him I took him into a restyrong and filled\r\nhim up with a good square meal.  And while we was eatin' he told me a\r\nlong yarn about what he'd been doin'; how he'd tried fust one thing and\r\nthen another, and had finally took to the sea.  And it seemed that his\r\nbad luck had follered him there, for he'd ended up by bein' shipwrecked\r\nupon one of them uncharted reefs that you runs up agin sometimes in the\r\nPacific, he bein' the only survivor out of the whole crowd.  If he was\r\ntellin' me the truth he must ha' had a pretty rough time on that reef,\r\nfor he described it as bein' as bare as the back of your hand, with\r\nnothin' to eat but birds' eggs and clams, and only a small, tricklin'\r\nstream of brackish, scarcely drinkable water to quench his thirst with.\r\nAnd he was on that there reef five solid months afore a whaler comed\r\nalong and, seein' his signals, took him off, and later transferred him\r\nto another ship that brought him home.\r\n\r\n\"Now when Abe had got this far with his yarn he begun to get mysterious,\r\nsunk his voice to a whisper, and asked if he could trust me.  I told him\r\nthat he best knew whether he could or not, and that anyway, if the thing\r\nwas a secret, I didn't want to hear anything about it.\r\n\r\n\"`Ah, but,' says he, `there's a fortune in it--a fortune for both of us,\r\nEph, if I can only trust you.'\r\n\r\n\"`Well,' I says, `as I told ye before, that's for you to decide.  But if\r\nyou're agoin' to trust me, get along with your trustin', for I reckon\r\nI've had about enough of this 'ere place; I don't like the looks of the\r\nfolks I sees around me, not a little bit, and I'm growin' sorter keen to\r\nget out of it.'\r\n\r\n\"`All right,' he says, `let's git.'  So we got, and made our way to\r\nCentral Park, where we found a seat in a quiet, secluded spot, and sat\r\nourselves down.  And there, a'ter sayin' as he'd got a secret that he\r\nmust share with somebody if he was to get any good out of it, and that I\r\nwas the only reely honest feller he knowed, Abe up and told me how,\r\na'ter he'd built a bit of a raft out of some of the wreckage of the\r\nship, so's he could go off fishin' in her, he one day happened to hit\r\nupon a big bed of pearl-oysters, thousan's--millions of 'em!  He sorter\r\nguessed what they was when he first set eyes on 'em, as he looked down\r\nthrough the clear green water, and tried to get down to 'em by divin'.\r\nBut that wa'n't no good; the water was too deep--a good five fathom he\r\nsaid there was over 'em--and then there was sharks about too.  So he\r\nunlaid a bit o' rope from the wreckage, knocked some nails out o' some\r\no' the timber that had druv ashore, and fixed up a sorter small grapple,\r\nwith which he went gropin' out on this here oyster bed.  But the thing\r\nwasn't of much account, accordin' to what Abe himself said.  First he'd\r\ngot to git it just so over a oyster afore it'd take holt; and then, when\r\nhe'd hooked one, as often as not the blamed thing'd let go agin afore he\r\ngot the oyster up out o' water: consequently it come to this, that with\r\nall his gropin' he only managed to land four oysters altogether.  But\r\nout of them four two had pearls in 'em, one bein' as big as a small\r\nmarble, while the others was little 'uns--three of 'em--'bout the size\r\nof cherry stones.\r\n\r\n\"Well, he took care of them there pearls, and managed to bring 'em home\r\nwith him.  And then, 'stead of takin' of 'em to a respectable jeweller,\r\nhe must needs try to trade 'em off to a Chinaman!  Of course you can\r\nguess what happened.  The Chink purtended that he was game to buy, took\r\nAbe to his house--leastways the Chink said it was his--doped Abe, stole\r\nthe pearls, and vamoosed!\r\n\r\n\"Then, a few days a'terwards, along comes I; and when Abe reckernised me\r\nhe made up his mind in a minute what he'd do.  First of all he offered\r\nto sell me the secret of the whereabouts of the oyster bed for fifty\r\nthousand dollars!  Only fifty thousand, mind yer, and nothin' but his\r\nbare word for it that there was so much as a single oyster in the place!\r\nI got up to go away and leave him; and then he asked me if I was game\r\nto go shares with him--he to give me the secret, I to go out to the\r\nPacific and fish up the pearls, and the two of us to divide equally when\r\nI got back home again.  Well, that was somethin' more like a business\r\nproposition, and after a lot o' talk I agreed; and he give me the\r\nlatitood and longitood of the place right there, afore I left him, I\r\ngivin' him a hundred dollars on account, to carry him along a bit until\r\nhe could get a job.  Then I went back home to Baltimore and began to\r\nfigure upon the best way to work the scheme.  I wa'n't rich enough to\r\nmake the trip purely as a speculation, so at last I hit upon the\r\nsandalwood idea, which I reckon'll pay the expenses of the v'yage and\r\nreturn me a profit, even if I don't find nary a pearl, although I've a\r\nvery good notion that they're where Abe said they was.  The next thing I\r\ndid was to get a few p'ints upon the ins-and-outs of sandalwood tradin';\r\nand when I'd done that I started out to get my stock of notions,\r\noverhaul the schooner and make her ready for the v'yage, and look about\r\nfor a crew of men that I could be sure wouldn't play no tricks after\r\nwe'd got hold of the pearls.\r\n\r\n\"We sailed from Baltimore the day a'ter Christmas, and, as we was\r\ncastin' off, this here letter that I told ye about was handed aboard.\r\nAnd when I come to open it, what d'ye think was the news in it?  Reckon\r\nyou'll never guess.  I've got a cousin 'way over in Nantucket--he's\r\npretty well-to-do--and findin' myself runnin' a bit short o' money when\r\nit come to fittin' out the schooner, I went over to him, told him all\r\nabout Abe and the pearls, and asked him to lend me a thousand dollars to\r\nleave with my old Marthy, to keep her goin' while I was away.  He knows\r\nme, and let me have the dollars straight away.  Well, this here letter\r\nwas from him; and what it said was that he was writin' in a hurry to\r\ntell me that he'd just heard, quite by accident, that Abe was dead--died\r\nin hospital in New York, havin' been run over and fatally injured by an\r\nexpress wagon two days a'ter I'd left him.  And--this is where the\r\ntrouble comes in--afore he died he sent post-haste for his\r\nbrother-in-law, Abner Slocum, to go to him to oncet, as he had somethin'\r\nmost terrible partic'lar to tell him.  Abner went; and although my\r\ncousin don't know what Abe told him, he guesses it had somethin' to do\r\nwith the pearls, because when Abner got back after buryin' Abe he went\r\nto work in a most tremenjous hurry to get his schooner, the\r\n_Kingfisher_, ready for sea, observin' the greatest secrecy about it,\r\nand refusin' to say what the hurry was, or where he was boun' to.  But\r\nhe was layin' in such a big stock of provisions and water that people\r\ngot talkin' about it; and that was how my cousin got to hear what was\r\ngoin' on.  But he didn't get to hear of it until just at the very last,\r\nwhich was on the day that the _Kingfisher_ went to sea, which was two\r\ndays before Christmas!  So, you see, this Abner Slocum was in such a\r\ntarnation hurry to git away that he wouldn't even wait to spend\r\nChristmas with his wife and kiddies.  Now, what d'ye make of that yarn?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said Cunningham, \"I am bound to admit, Captain, that it looks\r\nvery much as though your friend Abe, finding himself upon his deathbed,\r\nhad sent for his brother-in-law and divulged to him the secret of the\r\noyster bed.  Probably when he found himself dying, and realised that he\r\ncould derive no personal benefit from his discovery, he wished that the\r\nwealth should go to his own family.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's how I figure it out,\" agreed the skipper.  \"But I reckon that my\r\nclaim's just as good as Abner's, Abe havin' entered into a business\r\nagreement with me.  Besides, it isn't as though Abner'd make good use of\r\nthe money when he'd got it.  I know Abner Slocum through and through,\r\nand I tell you, gents, that he's out-and-out the very worst character in\r\nall Nantucket--a real, downright hard case, and--well, everything that's\r\nbad; and if he happens to get any o' them pearls he'll just drink\r\nhisself to death in three months, and most likely kill his wife into the\r\nbargain.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then in that case,\" said I, \"it seems to me that it will be a great\r\ndeal better that he should not have any of them.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, that's just my view of it too,\" agreed the skipper.  \"But I guess\r\nhe's goin' to do his level best to get hold of 'em,\" he continued.  \"I\r\nreckon that Abe must ha' told him that he'd parted with his secret to\r\nme, and that I was fittin' out to go in search of them there oysters,\r\nand that's the reason why he was so all-fired anxious to get to sea\r\nbefore me.  And as a matter o' fact he did it; he sailed three clear\r\ndays ahead of me, and must ha' been just about off Cape Henry when we\r\ncleared it.  So it's a race between the two schooners which'll get there\r\nfust, and, barrin' accidents, I reckon it's goin' to be a neck-and-neck\r\none, for the _Kingfisher's_ the smartest schooner sailin' out o'\r\nNantucket; and although Abner Slocum's such a downright `bad man' I'll\r\nsay this for him--there ain't a better seaman sailin' under `Old Glory'\r\nthan what he is.\r\n\r\n\"Now, gents, this here is my idee.  I'm agoin' to carry on, night and\r\nday, to get to that there spot in the Pacific where them pearls be; and\r\nwhen I gets there I'm goin' to scrape up as many oysters as ever I can\r\nlay hands on.  And when I've got 'em, and have realised upon 'em, I\r\nshall look upon half of the proceeds as belongin' to Abe, or--he bein'\r\ndead--his heirs.  But I mean to take partic'ler care that, let the heirs\r\nbe who they may, that skunk Abner don't touch a penny of the money.  If\r\nit turns out that Abner's children is the heirs, then I'm goin' to\r\napp'int trustees to look a'ter the money for 'em until a'ter Abner's\r\ndead, and then they can have it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Bravo, Captain!\" exclaimed Cunningham, patting the skipper approvingly\r\non the back.  \"A most wise and honourable decision to have arrived at, I\r\ncall it; and, so far as I am concerned, I'll do all I can to help you to\r\ncarry it out.  By the way, how do you propose to obtain the oysters when\r\nyou arrive at the spot where, according to your friend Abe, they are to\r\nbe found?\"\r\n\r\n\"How do I intend to get 'em?\" repeated the skipper.  \"Why, with a trawl,\r\nof course.  I've got some specially strong trawlin' gear aboard, made o'\r\npurpose for the job.\"\r\n\r\n\"I see,\" commented Cunningham.  \"It did not occur to you to get any\r\ndiving gear, I suppose?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well--no, it didn't, and that's a fact,\" answered the skipper.  \"But I\r\nguess we'll find that the trawl'll work all right,\" he added cheerfully.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, no doubt,\" agreed Cunningham.  \"But of course,\" he added, \"the\r\ndiving system would have worked very much more rapidly, because, you\r\nsee, if you had happened to possess a set of diving gear you could have\r\nanchored the schooner right over the bed, sent your diver down with two\r\nlarge sacks, or nets, and while he filled one you could have hauled up\r\nthe other and emptied it into the bins or barrels ranged round the decks\r\nin readiness to be conveyed ashore and emptied after the day's work on\r\nthe bed was over.  In that manner you could have secured several\r\nthousands of oysters daily.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ay, I reckon we could.  But I guess we'll have to be content to work\r\nwith the trawl, seein' that we've neither divin' gear nor diver aboard,\"\r\nreplied the skipper, rather regretfully.\r\n\r\n\"Well, I am not quite so sure about that,\" observed Cunningham\r\nthoughtfully.  \"I have the germ of an idea in my head, and will see if I\r\ncannot develop it.  Do you happen to have any rubber hose on board?\"\r\n\r\n\"Sure!\" replied the skipper.  \"Got a hundred feet of brand new hose for\r\nwashin' decks with.  It's a bit extravagant, I know, but I 'low it'll\r\npay in the long run.\"\r\n\r\n\"It most certainly will, and very handsomely too, if I can put my idea\r\ninto shape.  Have you used the hose at all yet?\" asked Cunningham.\r\n\r\n\"Used it every mornin' since we left Baltimore,\" replied the skipper.\r\n\r\n\"Then let me earnestly beg you not to use it any more, just for the\r\npresent at least,\" entreated the engineer.\r\n\r\n\"Just as you say,\" answered the skipper cheerfully.  \"We've got our old\r\ncanvas hose stowed away somewhere.  I'll have it routed out.\"\r\n\r\n\"Right,\" agreed Cunningham.  \"And while I'm keeping my watch on deck\r\nI'll think over this scheme of mine.  I should rather like you to get\r\nthe better of that man--what is his name?--oh yes, Slocum!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, that's all right,\" assented the skipper.  \"But--look here, if that\r\nthere scheme of yourn has to do with divin', Mister, who's goin' to do\r\nthe divin'?  I don't know nothin' about it.\"\r\n\r\n\"But I do,\" remarked Cunningham cheerfully.  \"I'll do the diving if I\r\ncan only work out this idea that has come to me.  And I believe I can.\"\r\n\r\nFrom this point the conversation drifted away into generalities, and\r\nfinally the skipper went below, leaving me in charge of the deck and of\r\nthe forenoon watch.  Later on Brown informed me that the late mate's\r\ncabin was entirely at my service, while Cunningham was inducted into a\r\nsmall spare stateroom which was in use as a sort of extra sail-room, but\r\nwhich the skipper ordered to be cleared out for the engineer's\r\naccommodation.  Also, it appeared that when the late mate went overboard\r\nhe left behind him a very fine sextant, which the skipper had purchased\r\nat the auction of the effects of the deceased, and this instrument he\r\nallowed me to use.\r\n\r\nWe, the new arrivals aboard the _Martha Brown_, shook down into our\r\npositions with a degree of promptitude that excited the liveliest\r\nadmiration of the skipper.  He was a shrewd old fellow, however, and for\r\nthe first two days after our arrival he remained on deck all day, and\r\nwas frequently up and down during the night, frankly confessing that he\r\nwas anxious to observe the manner in which his new officers performed\r\ntheir duties; but after that he announced his intention to sleep in all\r\nnight, laughingly declaring that as he was now employing two mates he\r\nsaw no reason why he should not leave them to do the work and take his\r\nease like a gentleman.  He was good enough to express his complete\r\nsatisfaction with my abilities as a navigator, and opened his eyes in\r\nastonishment when he saw that I was not content with a mere daily\r\nobservation of the meridian altitude of the sun, but used as well such\r\ncomparatively intricate problems as those of the double altitudes,\r\nlunars, altitudes of the stars, and Great Circle sailing.  But what\r\ngratified him most of all, I think, was the fact that before we had been\r\naboard two days I had got Simpson, the sailmaker, at work upon an\r\nenormous jack-yard gaff-topsail for use in light winds, the only\r\ngaff-topsail that the schooner had hitherto possessed being a trumpery\r\nlittle jib-headed affair which she could carry in quite a strong breeze.\r\nI also caused a set of preventer backstays to be fitted, which enabled\r\nus to carry an amount of canvas in a breeze that would otherwise have\r\nbeen impossible.\r\n\r\nWe certainly did carry on in a manner that sometimes made the old man\r\ngasp with astonishment, for hitherto he had been in the habit of sailing\r\nhis schooner in a very jog-trot fashion; but now we handled her as we\r\nwould have done a racer, and it was surprising to see how, day after\r\nday, her mileage increased, and how rapidly her track on the chart\r\nstretched southward.  The skipper, in his groping, cautious way, had\r\nfully intended to make sure of his position by heading for and sighting\r\nthe Falklands before attempting to make the Straits, but I told him I\r\nregarded that as an utterly useless waste of time, and worked out a\r\nGreat Circle track direct for Cape Virgins, at the entrance to the\r\nStraits, to his mingled consternation and delight.  \"If you don't cast\r\nthe schooner away between you,\" he said, \"I guess we'll get to that\r\nthere oyster bank early enough to clean it out before the _Kingfisher_\r\narrives; for, smart seaman as Slocum thinks hisself, I reckon he ain't a\r\npatch on you for carryin' on.\"\r\n\r\nFor the first three or four days after our arrival on board the _Martha\r\nBrown_, Cunningham devoted his energies entirely to the task of\r\nqualifying himself to take charge of a watch, looking after the ship,\r\nand generally polishing up his somewhat rusty seamanship; but he very\r\nquickly settled into his place, and then, whenever he had a spare\r\nmoment, he got to work with a pencil and paper, making sketches and\r\ncalculations.  Then, one evening in the second dog-watch, he brought to\r\nme a sheet of paper on which he had sketched the outline of a human\r\nfigure; he first showed me this, and then, producing a tape measure, he\r\ndesired me to measure him very accurately, jotting down upon the diagram\r\nthe several measurements as I called them out.\r\n\r\nThen, a day or two afterwards, I found him busily at work with a\r\nquantity of light, thin, iron rod, which he had routed out from among\r\nthe ship's stores.  This rod he cut up into carefully measured lengths,\r\nand he welded and riveted these together, with the aid of a portable\r\nforge which he had rigged up on the lee side of the fore deck, until, in\r\nthe course of a week, he had constructed some half a dozen light but\r\nstrong skeleton frames.  Having tried and proved these to his\r\nsatisfaction, he procured an empty oak barrel, and, taking it carefully\r\nto pieces, set the carpenter to work to saw, cut out, and carefully\r\nplane up a number of thin strips from the staves.  Then, when he had got\r\nas many of these strips as he required, he had small holes bored in them\r\nin certain positions, and, by means of a quantity of fine wire,\r\nproceeded to bind them carefully and strongly to the skeleton frames\r\nwhich he had previously made.  And when he had done that, to my\r\namazement he calmly proceeded to induct himself into them, with my\r\nassistance, and I then saw that the whole affair constituted a complete\r\nbody armour of a kind, helmet and all.  But, even then, I had no idea of\r\nwhat he was driving at until he condescended to explain.\r\n\r\n\"This,\" he said, \"is the foundation of my diving suit, which will be\r\ncomplete when I have covered it with a double thickness of well-oiled\r\ncanvas.  The framework of thin rod will keep the water pressure off my\r\nbody; the battens will support the outer covering of canvas and prevent\r\nit from bursting; and you will see that by the arrangement which I have\r\nadopted I secure ample flexibility for my purpose.  Then, as soon as we\r\narrive at our destination, I intend to have one of the screw deck-lights\r\nbodily removed and temporarily fixed in my helmet, which will enable me\r\nto see what I am doing when under water.  Of course I shall need weights\r\nto hold me down; and my air will come down to me through the rubber deck\r\nhose, one end of which will be let into the back of my helmet, while the\r\nother will be firmly secured to some portion of the schooner where it\r\nwill be out of the way.  Of course it will be a very rough-and-ready,\r\nmakeshift affair, but I believe it will prove fairly efficient for the\r\npurpose.\"\r\n\r\nCunningham's next business was to cut out and have sewn together for\r\nhimself a single garment which combined the functions of stockings,\r\ntrousers, and shirt.  This was made of a double thickness of stout\r\ncanvas, each thickness being well coated on both sides with two coats of\r\nboiled oil.  It was a weird-looking garment, as it was intended to fit\r\non outside the armour arrangement which he called his diving suit; but\r\nit was merely intended to exclude the water, and when it was finished\r\nand fitted I saw that it would serve its purpose perfectly well, and\r\nthere seemed to be no reason why he should not be able to work in it at\r\nthe bottom of the sea perfectly well.  And he completed the whole affair\r\nby firmly attaching one end of the rubber hose pipe to the back of his\r\nhelmet.\r\n\r\nWe made Cape Virgins on the day and at the hour, and almost the minute,\r\nwhich I had predicted, to the intense admiration and delight of the\r\nskipper; and reached Punta Arenas, in the Strait of Magellan, on the\r\nafternoon of the same day.  Here we came to an anchor, and Brown,\r\nCunningham, and I went ashore, the skipper's business being to arrange\r\nfor the refilling of our water tanks and the supply of a quantity of\r\nfresh meat, Cunningham's just to take a look round and stretch his long\r\nlegs a bit, and mine to report the seizure of the _Zenobia_ by\r\nBainbridge and the crew, and to post to the owners a letter upon the\r\nsame subject which I had prepared at my leisure.  Our first enquiry was\r\nas to whether the _Kingfisher_ had passed, and Brown's delight was great\r\nwhen he learned that thus far nothing had been seen of her.\r\n\r\nWe left Punta Arenas shortly after noon on the day following that of our\r\narrival, still with no sign of the _Kingfisher_, and, being lucky enough\r\nto get a fine little slant of wind, safely accomplished the dangerous\r\npassage and entered the Pacific on the evening of the succeeding day.\r\nThe slant of wind held long enough to enable us to gain an offing of a\r\ntrifle over a hundred miles, and then it died away and left us becalmed\r\nand rolling gunwale under on the long Pacific swell.\r\n\r\nYes, there could be no doubt that the _Martha Brown_ knew how to roll;\r\nit was my first experience of her in a flat calm and a heavy swell, and\r\nhad we not hastily rigged rolling tackles I verily believe that she\r\nwould have rolled the masts out of her.  Even the skipper, proud as he\r\nwas of her, felt obliged to make some sort of apology for her, which he\r\nwound up by saying: \"But some day a smarty'll come along and invent some\r\nway of turnin' this here rollin' to account as a means of propulsion,\r\nand then you'll see that builders'll fashion all ships upon the model of\r\nthe _Marthy_.\"\r\n\r\n\"Eh?  What's that?  Just say that again, Captain,\" remarked Cunningham,\r\nwho, it being the second dog-watch, happened to be on deck.\r\n\r\nThe skipper said it again.\r\n\r\n\"Y-e-es,\" agreed Cunningham, thoughtfully, \"y-e-es, I shouldn't wonder;\"\r\nand he walked away contemplatively.\r\n\r\n\"Now I wouldn't be so very powerful surprised if he was to turn out to\r\nbe the smarty that I just mentioned,\" observed the skipper, jerking his\r\nthumb toward where Cunningham stood gazing abstractedly over the\r\ntaffrail, with his feet wide apart and his hands locked behind him,\r\nbalancing himself to the violent movements of the little vessel.\r\n\r\n\"Possibly,\" I agreed.  \"Cunningham is of a very inventive turn of mind.\r\nBut to convert the rolling motion of a ship into a forward movement is a\r\npretty tall order, and would probably require exceedingly complicated\r\nmachinery.  The idea is by no means new, and I believe several inventors\r\nhave had a turn at it; but nothing practical seems to have come of it as\r\nyet.\"\r\n\r\nNothing further was said upon the subject just then; but, the calm\r\ncontinuing all night and all the next day, I several times caught\r\nCunningham with paper before him and a pencil in his hand, sketching and\r\ncalculating.  And when the next day also proved calm, and our\r\nobservations showed that we had not progressed a couple of miles upon\r\nour journey, the skipper again addressed Cunningham upon the subject,\r\nasking him half-jestingly if he had not yet been able to devise some\r\nscheme to turn the eternal rolling to account.\r\n\r\n\"Oh yes!\" answered Cunningham; \"I dare say I could rig up some sort of\r\nan arrangement, if it were worth while.  But it would be rather a\r\ncumbersome contrivance to ship and unship, and I would not recommend it\r\nunless there is likely to be much of this sort of thing between here and\r\nour destination.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said the skipper, \"I reckon we may depend pretty certainly upon\r\nat least a fortnight of ca'ms afore we arrive at that there oyster bed;\r\nand it'd be worth a whole lot to me to get there a fortnight ahead of\r\nthe _Kingfisher_.  What's the thing like that you've invented, Mister,\r\nand could we knock it up out o' the stuff as we've got aboard?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh yes!\" answered Cunningham, \"I have kept strictly in mind our\r\ncapabilities in the preparation of my sketch.  I could easily devise a\r\nmuch better and more efficient concern, I am sure; but that would be\r\nquite useless to you, because we have neither the materials nor the\r\nskilled labour aboard to produce it.  But,\" he continued, producing a\r\npencil and paper and beginning to sketch rapidly, \"I think we might\r\nmanage to knock together a contrivance of this sort.  There would be two\r\nof them, you understand, one on each side of the ship.  This represents\r\na stout timber frame, which would be secured in place by short lengths\r\nof chain bowsed taut by tackles, so that it would remain rigidly in\r\nposition.  It would reach from the rail down to about three feet below\r\nthe surface of the water.  This outrigger arrangement, which should be\r\nabout nine feet long, will serve as the attachment for what we may call\r\na fin, made of flexible planking securely fixed at its fore end to the\r\noutrigger, but quite free to move at the other end.  Now this fin, being\r\nsubmerged when the frame is fixed in place, will be acted upon by the\r\npressure of the water as the ship rolls, and will bend alternately\r\nupward and downward at an angle, the effect being that every time the\r\nship rolls the bent fin will force backward a considerable quantity of\r\nwater, or, what is the same thing, will have a tendency to thrust the\r\nship forward at a rate which I estimate at--well, say about three knots\r\nper hour.\"\r\n\r\n\"Three knots an hour,\" repeated the skipper.  \"'Tain't very much, is it?\r\nI thought, maybe, that you'd be able to fix up somethin' that 'd shove\r\nher along at about ten or twelve knots.\"\r\n\r\nCunningham laughed as he shook his head.  \"Come, come, Captain!\" he\r\nprotested, \"be reasonable.  To get ten or twelve knots out of this\r\nschooner you would require a steam engine of some eighty to a hundred\r\nhorse power.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ay,\" admitted the skipper, rather unwillingly, \"I s'pose I should.\r\nThree knots an hour.  That's, in round figures, seventy miles from noon\r\nto noon.  And that, for, say, fourteen days, is--how much?\"\r\n\r\n\"Nine hundred and eighty miles; call it a thousand,\" answered\r\nCunningham.\r\n\r\n\"A thousand miles.  Jings!  It mounts up when you come to look at it\r\nthat way,\" averred the skipper.  \"Look here, Mister,\" he continued,\r\nafter thinking for a minute, \"how long do you reckon it would take you\r\nto fix up that concarn of yours?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, not very long,\" answered Cunningham.  \"The very roughest of\r\nworkmanship would do, so long as it was strong.  I dare say Chips and I\r\ncould put it together in--well--say four days.\"\r\n\r\n\"Four days,\" repeated the skipper; \"four days.  Then I reckon you better\r\ngo ahead straight away; and turn it out as quick as ever you can, for\r\nthis here ca'm looks as though it meant to last a goodish while yet.\r\nThe glass is high an' steady, with an upward tendency, if anything, and\r\nI don't see no sign of wind anywheres about.\"\r\n\r\nWithin an hour Cunningham and Chips were hard at work upon the\r\ncontrivance for circumventing the \"ca'ms\", and before knocking-off time\r\nthey had got on deck all the timber they required, and some of it sawn\r\nto its proper length.  The next day saw the completion of the cutting,\r\nsawing, and planing; and then came a fresh westerly breeze which enabled\r\nus to lay up within about two points of our course for the next five\r\ndays, during which Cunningham completed his work, all but the bolting on\r\nof the fins, which could be done in about ten minutes.  Then the wind\r\ngradually veered until we were not only enabled to lay our course, but\r\nhad it a couple of points free, when, the wind being light, our big\r\njack-yard gaff-topsail came into play with magnificent effect, pushing\r\nthe little hooker along at about six knots, when but for it she would\r\nscarcely have done four.  And finally it fell calm again, and the\r\nschooner lost steerage way altogether.  There was again every sign that\r\nthe calm was likely to be prolonged--in fact, we were in the latitudes\r\nof the \"Doldrums\", or calms that occur just to the north and south of\r\nthe Trade winds, where, as on the Line, the calms sometimes last for\r\nweeks at a stretch.  It was therefore an excellent opportunity to test\r\nCunningham's contrivance, and we accordingly proceeded to bolt it up and\r\nfix it in position.  It was rather an awkward and cumbersome\r\narrangement, demanding the united strength of all hands to get it over\r\nthe side, and it took us a full hour to get both parts fixed firmly and\r\nto Cunningham's satisfaction.  But it had not been in position five\r\nminutes before we saw that it was going to prove a success; for not only\r\ndid it serve to steady the little vessel, and ease her rolling to a\r\nconsiderable extent, but she immediately began to gather way, and within\r\nhalf an hour was slipping along through the water at the rate of a shade\r\nover four knots by the log.  The skipper was enchanted.  \"Furl\r\neverything, Mr Temple,\" he said, \"and head her due no'th.  We'll just\r\nmeander along now under bare poles until we runs into the south-east\r\nTrades; and when once we hits them we'll be all right, and needn't start\r\ntack nor sheet again until we reaches our oyster bed.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER SEVEN.\r\n\r\nTHE PEARL-OYSTER BED.\r\n\r\nWe caught the south-east Trade winds the next day, very light at first,\r\nbut gradually freshening as we ran farther into them; and then, as soon\r\nas we found ourselves fairly in the grip of the true breeze, with the\r\nwater rippling blue and crisply all about us, we got the schooner under\r\ncanvas once more, hoisted our \"fins\" inboard, and bore away upon a\r\nnor'-west course, with starboard studdingsails and big gaff-topsail set\r\nand dragging like a team of cart horses.  A week of this sort of thing\r\ncarried us to the calm belt under the Line; and here we once more\r\nbrought our \"fins\" into action, using them for three whole days and a\r\ntrifle over before we touched the southernmost fringe of the north-east\r\nTrades, when we again went bowling along under all plain sail, that\r\nbeing as much as we could conveniently show to a beam wind.  Finally, on\r\na certain morning immediately after breakfast, I climbed to the\r\ntopgallant yard, armed with Cunningham's telescope, which I had borrowed\r\nfor the occasion, and, looking straight ahead, saw--just where I had\r\nexpected to see it, namely, some fifteen miles beyond our jibboom end--a\r\npatch of white water, some three miles in length, stretching north and\r\nsouth right athwart the schooner's hawse.  It was the coral reef upon\r\nwhich, if the skipper's friend Abe Johnson had spoken truth, that worthy\r\nhad suffered shipwreck, followed by all the horrors of complete solitude\r\nfor five solid months; and some two miles beyond which lay--according to\r\nAbe--the rich pearl-oyster bed that was the real object of the _Martha\r\nBrown's_ visit to this lonesome spot in the heart of the Pacific.\r\n\r\n\"See anything, Mr Temple?\" hailed the skipper from the quarterdeck, in\r\na voice tense with excitement.\r\n\r\n\"Ay, ay, sir,\" I replied.  \"It is there, right enough, as plain as mud\r\nin a wine-glass, about fifteen miles off, and stretching right athwart\r\nour hawse.  You had better luff a point, sir, and go round its northern\r\nextremity.\"\r\n\r\n\"Luff a p'int it is,\" answered the skipper, directing the helmsman.\r\nThen, as the schooner came to her new course, \"How's that, Mr Temple?\"\r\n\r\n\"Excellent, sir,\" I replied; \"we shall just nicely clear the northern\r\nend of the reef if she is kept at that.\"\r\n\r\n\"D'ye see anything else besides the reef, Mr Temple?\" asked the\r\nskipper,--\"anything, I mean, in the shape of another schooner, for\r\ninstance?\"\r\n\r\n\"Nothing at all, sir,\" I answered.\r\n\r\n\"That's all right, then,\" answered the skipper in a tone of exuberant\r\nsatisfaction.  \"I guess you don't need to stay up there no longer, do\r\nye?\"\r\n\r\nI slung the telescope round my neck by its strap, and then, swinging off\r\nthe yard, slid down to the deck hand over hand by way of the topgallant\r\nbackstay, walking aft and joining the skipper and Cunningham as soon as\r\nmy feet touched the planks.\r\n\r\n\"So the reefs there, all right, is it?\" remarked Brown, as I joined the\r\npair and returned the telescope with thanks to its lawful owner.  \"There\r\nain't no chance of a mistake, I s'pose?\"\r\n\r\n\"No chance at all,\" I replied confidently.  \"It is there as plain as the\r\nnose on one's face.  If you remember, I told you yesterday that,\r\nprovided the breeze held, we should be at anchor in the lagoon by noon\r\nto-day; and so we shall.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ay, ay,\" answered Brown.  \"I remember your sayin' so.  And I didn't\r\ndoubt your word, not for a second, for you're an A1 navigator, and no\r\nmistake.  Never knowed a better.  But I was just a little bit afeard\r\nthat Abe might ha' been playin' it on me, or else that his riggers might\r\nha' got a bit mixed.  But I reckon it's a square deal, since you say\r\nthat the reefs there.  What do it look like?\"\r\n\r\n\"From aloft it presents the precise appearance that you described to\r\nme,\" I said.  \"A bare reef, almost awash, with not a thing upon it,\r\nexcept a few birds which I could just make out circling in the air above\r\nit.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ay, that'll be it, sure enough,\" agreed Brown.  \"I remember Abe\r\nspeakin' about them birds.  Their eggs, some clams that he knocked off\r\nthe rocks, and a fish or two that he managed to catch later on was all\r\nthat the pore feller had to eat for five everlastin' months--and raw at\r\nthat.\"\r\n\r\nIt was just five bells when we weathered the northern extremity of the\r\nreef and bore away to look for the entrance to the lagoon.  I was then\r\naloft again, for the sake of the more extended view obtainable from the\r\nheight of the topgallant yard; and as we swept past the reef, and I\r\nlooked down upon it, I thought I had never seen a more ghastly place for\r\na solitary human being to be cast away upon.  It was composed,\r\napparently, of nothing but coral, upon which the everlasting surf was\r\ngradually casting up a deposit of sand, which, when dry, the wind was as\r\ngradually distributing over its surface.  Here and there I observed dark\r\npatches which I took to be seaweed, partly buried in the sand; and there\r\nwas a tolerably well defined tide-mark, consisting apparently of more\r\nseaweed, and flotsam of various kinds cast up by the surf.\r\n\r\nBut the most remarkable thing about the island was the multitude of\r\nbirds, gulls principally.  There were thousands of them in the air about\r\nthe reef, and many more thousands of them sitting on the reef itself.\r\nThe time was no doubt coming when the guano of these birds, their dead\r\nbodies, and the refuse of their food, mingling and agglomerating with\r\nthe sand and rotting seaweed, would form an extraordinarily rich soil,\r\nupon which a few coconuts, drifting across the illimitable ocean, would\r\nbe cast up by the surf, and, becoming buried, would sprout, throw out\r\nroots and shoots, and become trees, as has happened in the case of so\r\nmany others of the Pacific islands.  But at that moment there was not a\r\ngreen thing upon it.\r\n\r\nThe atoll, as a whole, was almost perfectly circular in shape, having a\r\ndiameter of about four miles; and for purposes of description it may be\r\nspoken of as consisting of three parts, namely, the island, the lagoon,\r\nand the encircling reef.  The island, which, being dry, was of course\r\nthe highest part of the atoll, measured about three and a quarter miles\r\nlong, and was crescent-shaped, being about three-eighths of a mile wide\r\nin the middle, tapering off north and south in the form of the cusps of\r\nthe crescent moon; and from the extremities of the two cusps there swept\r\naway the encircling reef which enclosed the lagoon in a very perfect\r\nnatural breakwater, having the inevitable opening as nearly as might be\r\nin its middle, just opposite the widest part of the island.  But\r\nalthough I have spoken of the island as being the highest part, it must\r\nnot be supposed that even this rose any considerable height above the\r\nlevel of the ocean, its highest point, as we subsequently ascertained,\r\nbeing only a bare six feet above the water's surface.\r\n\r\nI was fortunate enough to catch a glimpse of the passage through the\r\nreef almost immediately after going aloft; we therefore had no\r\ndifficulty in hitting it off, and, conning the schooner from the\r\ncrosstrees, I took her through without a hitch, our anchor plunging into\r\nthe placid waters of the lagoon a few minutes after the skipper had\r\nstruck six bells.\r\n\r\n\"Well, gents,\" Brown remarked, rubbing his hands, as, having been\r\nforward to supervise the mooring of the ship in my absence aloft, he\r\ncame aft and joined Cunningham and myself, while the crew took to the\r\nrigging and went aloft to furl the canvas, \"here we are at last; and\r\nne'er a sign of the _Kingfisher_ anywhere about.  Did ye happen to\r\nnotice anything at all like a h'yster bank anywhere near while you was\r\naloft, Mr Temple?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir, I did,\" answered I.  \"I took a good look round while we were\r\ncoming in, and I noticed a distinct discoloration of the water about a\r\nmile out, as dead to leeward of the island as it can possibly be.  I\r\nhave no doubt we shall find that to be the shoal of which your friend\r\nspoke.  And there was another thing I noticed while I was aloft, and\r\nwhich I will take this opportunity of mentioning.  The island is\r\nliterally covered with birds, sir, and, unfortunate as is the necessity,\r\nI am afraid that our very first task must be to kill every one of them.\"\r\n\r\n\"Kill off them birds, Mr Temple?\" echoed the skipper, in a tone of\r\nmingled surprise and indignation.  \"Why, what harm are they adoin'?\"\r\n\r\n\"None at all at present, sir.  But--by the way, how do you propose to\r\nobtain the pearls which you hope to procure from the oysters in yonder\r\nbed?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" answered the skipper, \"I had it in my mind to take the schooner\r\nout to the bed every mornin' and anchor her right on top of it.  Then I\r\nthought of lowerin' the boats, and, as the oysters comes up, dischargin'\r\n'em into the boats, one boat at a time, until we've got a fair cargo,\r\na'ter which that boat'll be sent ashore in charge of, say, two men; and\r\nNumber 2 boat'll be loadin' while Number 1 is goin' ashore and comin'\r\nback.  And when the oysters is took ashore, my plan is to spread 'em out\r\non the island and let 'em rot in the sun, an'--ah yes! now I see what\r\nyou means about them blamed birds.  They'll just go for them rottin'\r\noysters an' play the very Ole Gooseberry with 'em--is that what you\r\nmean?\"\r\n\r\n\"Precisely,\" I said.  \"They will attack the decaying oysters, and you\r\nwill probably lose about three-fourths of your pearls.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ay, I see; I see,\" murmured the \"Old Man\".  \"It seems a most tarnation\r\npity,\" he continued regretfully, \"but I guess we'll have to do it--or\r\nlose most o' them pearls.\"\r\n\r\n\"It will be an endless job, too--to say nothing of the pity of it--to\r\nkill off all those thousands of birds,\" remarked Cunningham.  \"But\r\nperhaps, after all, it may not be necessary to resort to such extreme\r\nmeasures as that.  Have you any firearms on board, Captain?\"\r\n\r\n\"You bet I have, and ammunition too,\" answered the skipper, with a grin.\r\n\"You don't catch old Eph Brown venturin' his property on an expedition\r\nlike this here--among savages, too, when we gets away down among the\r\nislands a'ter that there sandalwood--without bringin' along the means to\r\ndefend it.  I got a dozen muskets and six shot guns down below; and I\r\nreckon I can get the lot out in ten minutes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then,\" said Cunningham, \"I'll tell you what we will do, Captain, if you\r\nare agreeable.  Let Temple and me have a couple of those shot guns, with\r\na moderate quantity of ammunition, and we will go ashore and shoot a\r\nsufficient number of those birds to make them thoroughly afraid of\r\nanything resembling the human figure.  Then, when we have done that, we\r\nwill rig up a scarecrow on the leeward extremity of the island, where I\r\nsuppose you will deposit your oysters to undergo the process of decay,\r\nand see how that acts before we attempt anything in the nature of actual\r\nwholesale slaughter.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" assented the skipper eagerly, \"I guess that plan's well worth\r\ntryin', and I'm much obliged to ye for thinkin' of it.  I don't want the\r\ndeath of any more o' them birds laid to my door than what there's\r\nactooal need for, for they're purty creeturs, and, when all's said and\r\ndone, God made 'em, same's He made you and me.  But I'm afeard that a\r\nfew of 'em'll have to die, so the job might as well be done at once.\r\nI'll go down below and get them shot guns, and you and Mr Temple might\r\nas well go ashore directly after dinner.\"\r\n\r\nAccordingly, as soon as our midday dinner was over, the gig--our gig--\r\nwas hoisted out, and Cunningham and I, with two hands for a crew, and\r\nwith a shot gun each, together with a double pocketful of cartridges,\r\nwent ashore to perform the exceedingly unpleasant but necessary task of\r\nfrightening the birds so effectually that they would not be likely to\r\ninterfere to any very great extent with our pearling operations.  At the\r\nlast moment, just before shoving off from the schooner's side,\r\nCunningham shouted to the cook to pass down into the boat the biggest\r\nbasket that he could find, and this the \"Doctor\" did, with the result\r\nthat when we landed on the island we carried with us a basket capable of\r\nholding quite one hundred gulls' eggs.\r\n\r\nWe had already decided that the southern extremity of the island was the\r\nproper place upon which to deposit our oysters, when obtained, because\r\nby placing them there the exceedingly offensive odour which would be\r\ngenerated by the process of decay would be carried away by the wind over\r\nthe open sea, while by anchoring the schooner as far to windward as\r\npossible we might hope to escape in a very great measure, if not\r\naltogether, the annoyance of the smell; therefore, upon landing, we\r\nstarted operations at the south end of the island by driving the birds\r\naway from there.\r\n\r\nBut our task was by no means so easy as we had anticipated; for so\r\nextraordinarily tame were the birds that they positively refused to rise\r\nat our approach, actually permitting themselves to be caught and their\r\nnecks to be wrung rather than take the trouble to get out of our way.\r\nCertainly they resisted actual capture most vigorously, fighting us with\r\nbeak and wing, and many a sharp peck and severe blow did we receive\r\nwithin the first ten minutes of our operations; but they would not take\r\nto flight, or make the slightest attempt of any kind to avoid us.\r\nConsequently at length, and very much against our will, we were obliged\r\nto open fire upon them, and it was not until the creatures saw the\r\nstruggles and heard the piteous cries of the wounded among them that\r\nthey at length began to grasp the fact that we were enemies, and\r\ndangerous.  And even then it was not until we had killed some three\r\nhundred of them that they seemed to have fully learned their lesson, and\r\ntook to flight at our approach.  While this wretched work of slaughter\r\nwas proceeding the two men with the basket followed in our footsteps and\r\ncollected the eggs from the abandoned nests, choosing the cleanest as\r\nbeing most likely to be fresh; so that, upon our return to the schooner\r\nthat night, the cook got to work, and all hands supped sumptuously upon\r\nboiled and fried gulls' eggs, while we in the cabin regaled ourselves\r\nupon savoury omelette, followed by pancakes.\r\n\r\nAfter supper Cunningham and I, with an old, discarded suit of clothes\r\nbelonging to the skipper, rigged up a most realistic scarecrow, ready\r\nfor transportation to the shore the first thing next morning.\r\n\r\nWe were all astir at daybreak next day; and while the hands, under the\r\nskipper's supervision, hoisted out the longboat and jollyboat and passed\r\nthem astern ready for towing, and then proceeded to wash down the decks,\r\nCunningham and I took the gig, and, carefully depositing our scarecrow\r\nin the sternsheets, pulled ashore and set up the figure, the birds\r\ntaking to the air with loud, plaintive cries the moment that we stepped\r\nashore.  Then, having set up the figure, which represented a man\r\ncarrying a gun, we returned to the schooner, observing with\r\nsatisfaction, as we did so, that the birds seemed indisposed to settle\r\nagain, but, after wheeling in the air over the island for some time,\r\nwinged their way out to sea.\r\n\r\nBy the time that we got back to the schooner breakfast was ready, and\r\nall hands were at once piped to the meal, regardless of the hour, the\r\nword at the same time being passed that everybody would be expected on\r\ndeck again within twenty minutes.  But no such warning was needed, for\r\nthe forecastle hands by this time knew as well as the afterguard what we\r\nhad come to this lonesome spot for, and were as eager as ourselves not\r\nonly to see how the adventure would \"pan out\"--to use their own\r\nexpression--but also to gain the utmost possible advantage over the\r\n_Kingfisher_ and her people, whom they regarded as would-be lawless\r\npoachers upon our own private property; therefore when we of the cabin\r\nreturned to the deck after a hasty meal, which we had bolted in less\r\nthan a quarter of an hour, all hands were on deck, ready and waiting for\r\norders.  Accordingly no sooner did the skipper poke his head out of the\r\ncompanion and bellow the order to loose all fore-and-aft canvas than the\r\ngroup on the forecastle split itself up into sections, one section\r\nactually running aft to cast loose the mainsail, while a second attacked\r\nthe foresail, a third laid out to loose the jibs, and the fourth and\r\nlast proceeded to fix the levers of the patent windlass and to heave in\r\nthe slack of the cable.\r\n\r\nA quarter of an hour sufficed us to get the canvas set and the anchor\r\nbroken out of the sand; and then, as the schooner paid off and filled,\r\nCunningham proceeded to get his diving gear on deck and to make ready\r\nfor the great experiment, while I sprang into the fore rigging and made\r\nmy way aloft to the topsail-yard, from which to con the schooner out\r\nthrough the reef in the first place, and afterwards to look out for the\r\noyster bed.  We could not possibly have had a finer day for the\r\nbeginning of our operations, for the sky was a clear, rich, deep blue,\r\ndappled here and there at intervals with small patches of Trade-cloud,\r\nwhich looked like bits of cotton wool, drifting solemnly athwart the\r\nazure, while the Trade wind was blowing very moderately, and there was\r\nno sea to speak of.\r\n\r\nI had scarcely got myself comfortably settled upon the topsail-yard when\r\nthe skipper hailed me from where he stood aft close alongside the\r\nhelmsman.\r\n\r\n\"Tawps'l-yard, there!\" he shouted.  \"I s'pose you don't happen to see\r\nnothin' of that there blamed _Kingfisher_ anywhere about, do ye, Mr\r\nTemple?\"\r\n\r\nI sent my gaze slowly and searchingly right round the entire rim of the\r\nhorizon.  The air was so crystal-clear that no glass was needed to aid\r\nthe eye.  Had there been as much as three or four feet of a\r\nroyal-masthead showing above the horizon I could not have failed to\r\ndetect it, but there was nothing; the horizon was absolutely bare in\r\nevery direction, and I so reported it.  The skipper waved his hand by\r\nway of reply, and I forthwith turned my attention to the business in\r\nhand, which was that of conning the schooner through the passage in the\r\nreef.\r\n\r\nTwenty minutes later we were outside, rising and falling easily upon the\r\nlong Pacific swell; and the moment that it was prudent for us to do so\r\nwe starboarded our helm a trifle and kept away for the slightly\r\ndiscoloured patch of water that seemed to mark the position of the shoal\r\nupon which we expected to find the boundless wealth of the extensive bed\r\nof pearl-oysters spoken of by the departed Abe.  Ten minutes sufficed us\r\nto run down to it, and the moment that we reached it I saw that we had\r\nnot come upon a wild-goose chase.  The oysters were there, all right,\r\nthousands, millions of them, showing up as a light-brown patch, nearly\r\nten acres in extent, clearly distinguishable through the crystal-clear\r\nwater.  I allowed the schooner to run to about the very centre of the\r\npatch, and then shouted for the anchor to be let go.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile all halyards had been let run two or three minutes earlier,\r\nand the canvas was rolled up anyhow, everybody, from the skipper to the\r\ncabin boy, seeming to be suddenly seized with a perfect delirium of\r\nexcitement.  As for me, I went down on deck by way of the backstays, and\r\nat once proceeded to lend Cunningham a hand to get into his makeshift\r\ndiving rig, which he was very carefully overhauling.  And while this was\r\ndoing, four of the hands came along with a twenty-five-foot ladder,\r\nheavily weighted at the bottom with pigs of iron ballast, which\r\nCunningham had caused to be constructed; and this they launched over the\r\nside, allowing it to hang plumb up and down, well secured, just abaft\r\nthe main rigging.  This was for Cunningham to descend by; and upon\r\nlooking over the side I saw that it reached to within about four feet of\r\nthe surface of the oyster bed.  The getting of Cunningham into his suit,\r\nand the arranging of all the preliminaries, such as the rigging of a\r\nderrick wherewith to hoist to the surface the nets of oysters after\r\nCunningham had filled them, the hauling of the longboat alongside to\r\nreceive the first load, and so on, kept us busy for a full half-hour,\r\nduring which the skipper paced to and fro, urging us to hurry, and\r\ngnawing his finger nails to the quick in his excitement and impatience.\r\n\r\nBut at length everything was ready, even to the shovel which Cunningham\r\nwas to use for shovelling the oysters into the nets; and with the upper\r\nend of the air hose securely made fast to the main rigging, close to\r\nwhere I stood with the signal line coiled in my hands ready for paying\r\nout, and with a stout sword bayonet girt about his waist as a defence\r\nagainst the possible attack of prowling sharks, the amateur diver was\r\nassisted to climb the rail and get his feet upon the topmost rung of the\r\nladder, after which he was left to his own devices.  We had taken the\r\nprecaution to send a good man aloft in a boatswain's chair, bent to the\r\nend of the gaff-topsail halyards, to keep a lookout for sharks, and he\r\nhad reported none in sight; we therefore hoped that we should not suffer\r\nany very serious interruption from them, and Cunningham went over the\r\nside with the utmost confidence, I keeping my eye on him as he\r\ncautiously descended the ladder rung by rung, and paying out the signal\r\nline in such a manner as always to maintain a very light strain upon it.\r\n\r\nAt length I saw him step off the bottom rung of the ladder and gingerly\r\nlower himself to the surface of the oyster bed, having reached which he\r\ngave a single tug of his signal line to indicate that he was all right.\r\nThen, after pausing for a moment, apparently to take a good look round,\r\nhe cast off the shovel from the end of the line by which it had been\r\nlowered, and proceeded methodically to shovel the oysters, just as they\r\ncame, into one of the nets, which had also been lowered within his\r\nreach.  Ten minutes of steady work now ensued, at the end of which he\r\ngave the signal to hoist away, and up came our first spoils, probably\r\nabout five hundred oysters, which were swung over the longboat and\r\nemptied into her, the second net having meanwhile been lowered down to\r\nthe diver.\r\n\r\nAnd now there occurred a somewhat diverting episode; for no sooner was\r\nthe first net-load of oysters discharged into the longboat than the\r\nskipper, unable any longer to endure the suspense, scrambled over the\r\nside, armed with a formidable jack knife, and, leaping down into the\r\nboat, seized an oyster and proceeded to force it open with the blade of\r\nhis knife, no doubt fully expecting to find at least one pearl of price\r\nin it.  But, alas! the poor man was doomed to disappointment, for there\r\nwas no sign or vestige of pearl in the fish, save the lovely iridescent\r\nlining of the two shells.  A second attempt fared no better, and the\r\ndisappointed seeker flung the shells far from him with a muttered\r\nsomething that sounded not unlike an imprecation.  But the good man was\r\nnot to be so easily put off.  A third oyster was seized and savagely\r\nwrenched open, and this time three diminutive seed pearls rewarded his\r\nperseverance.  Yet still he was not satisfied.  A fourth oyster was\r\nopened, and proved a blank; a fifth was seized, and as the two shells\r\nwere forced apart a magnificent pearl was revealed, together with some\r\nsix or eight much smaller ones.  A shout of triumph apprised us all of\r\nthe fact that at last the search had proved successful; and the next\r\nmoment up came the skipper, his face aflame with delight and excitement,\r\nto show all and sundry what a pearl looked like when fresh taken from\r\nthe parent fish.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the process of filling, hoisting, and emptying the nets went\r\nsteadily on for the best part of an hour, and then Cunningham signalled\r\nthat he was coming to the surface, some three thousand oysters having by\r\nthat time been secured.  When Cunningham presently appeared, and the\r\nglass of his helmet was unscrewed, he informed us that his makeshift\r\nsuit was perfectly watertight, and answered its purpose even better than\r\nhe had dared to expect, and that he had come up simply because he felt\r\nfatigued with his unaccustomed work and needed a little rest.  The\r\nskipper thought this a good opportunity to change boats, so he sent away\r\nthe longboat with her load in charge of a couple of men, giving them\r\ninstructions how to dispose of the oysters; and the gig was hauled up\r\nalongside in her place.  Then the boatswain, who had all along\r\nmanifested the utmost interest in the diving question, volunteered to\r\nchange places with Cunningham and do a spell of shovelling: but the\r\nengineer explained that he could take another turn below quite easily,\r\nand proposed, as an amendment, that the boatswain should take on the\r\nafternoon shift; and, this being arranged, he again descended and\r\nresumed operations.\r\n\r\nThen in due course there came a brief respite while everybody went to\r\ndinner, half an hour being allowed for the meal, at the expiration of\r\nwhich time operations went on uninterruptedly until about half an hour\r\nbefore sunset, when we were perforce obliged to cease work, in order to\r\nget the schooner back into the lagoon before nightfall.  But we had done\r\nnot at all badly; for I had kept a rough--a very rough--account of the\r\nnumber of oysters that had been brought to the surface that day, not\r\ncounting them, of course, but just estimating the number that had come\r\nup in each net, and when I came to total up I found that, unless my\r\ncalculations were a long way out, we must have secured at least\r\ntwenty-five thousand oysters as a reward for our day's work.\r\n\r\nBut this by no means ended with the mooring of the schooner in the\r\nlagoon, for when that was done there still remained the oysters to be\r\nlaid out in rows upon the southern extremity of the island; and we soon\r\nfound that the landing and laying of them out was a much more lengthy\r\nprocess than the getting of them up from the sea bottom.  Very\r\nfortunately for us, we had arrived at the island when the moon was four\r\ndays old, and in that exquisitely clear atmosphere a moon of even that\r\nage affords a very useful amount of light, of which we availed ourselves\r\nto empty the boats and make all ready for the next day before finally\r\nknocking-off work.\r\n\r\nThe next day was, with a rather notable exception, just a repetition of\r\nthe day which had preceded it.  The weather was as fine, and matters\r\nworked even more smoothly, for almost every hour revealed to us some\r\nlittle improvement that might be made in our methods of work, which we\r\npromptly adopted.  Thus, for example, the boatswain having proved\r\nhimself to be quite an expert diver, it was arranged that Cunningham and\r\nhe should work spell and spell about, each man working two hours and\r\nthen taking two hours' complete rest.  On this, our second day upon the\r\nbank, Cunningham and the boatswain had each been down once, the dinner\r\nhour had arrived and passed, and Cunningham was down again, working with\r\ntremendous energy--for a friendly rivalry had already arisen between him\r\nand the boatswain as to who could send up the most oysters--while I\r\nstood in the main chains, tending the signal line and intently watching\r\nthe toiling figure diligently shovelling oysters away down below in the\r\ncool green shadow of the schooner's hull.  As on the previous day, we\r\nhad a man aloft for the express purpose of keeping a lookout for sharks,\r\nbut every time we hailed him his reply was that there were no sharks in\r\nsight.\r\n\r\nSuddenly, as I stood watching Cunningham, a great greyish-brown object\r\nslid lazily along beneath me, and paused immediately above the toiling\r\ndiver.  A single glance sufficed me to identify it as a shark, full\r\ntwenty feet in length; and I instantly sent down the pre-arranged danger\r\nsignal, while the man at the masthead yelled: \"Shark ho! right over the\r\ndiver!\"  I sang out to the two men who were in the boat receiving the\r\noysters as they came up to seize a couple of oars and violently splash\r\nthe surface of the water with them, in the hope that the sound would\r\ndrive the brute away--for, after all, the shark, voracious as it is, is\r\na timid creature, easily frightened by any sudden or unaccustomed noise.\r\nAnd the attempt met with at least partial success, for the shark\r\ninstantly darted away a few yards; but it as suddenly turned, and,\r\napparently quite undismayed by the splashing, slowly came back.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, however, Cunningham had dropped his shovel, and, having drawn\r\nthe sword bayonet with which he was armed, stood quite quietly on the\r\ndefensive, alertly on the watch.  Evidently the shark did not quite know\r\nwhat to make of the strange creature on the sea bottom, for he now began\r\nto swim rapidly to and fro, making short tacks each way of a few yards\r\nonly, eyeing Cunningham intently all the while.  Then, before we could\r\ndo anything in the nature of intervention, the brute suddenly wheeled\r\nand made a dash straight for the engineer.  So lightning swift was the\r\nonslaught that the only thing I distinctly saw was the quick whisk of\r\nthe creature's tail as it turned, and the sudden dart of the great body,\r\nfollowed by an equally sudden writhing movement; then in an instant the\r\ngreat fish appeared to be enveloped in a cloud of red, in which it\r\nalmost disappeared; and the next thing I distinctly realised was that it\r\nwas gone, while, the red cloud slowly dissipating, Cunningham was\r\npresently revealed in the very act of recovering his shovel for the\r\npurpose of resuming work.  I signalled to him to come up at once, but he\r\nreplied with a vigorous negative, and the next moment he was hard at\r\nwork again.\r\n\r\nA minute or two later the man aloft hailed: \"I guess Mr Cunningham have\r\ngive that there shark his gruel; for there he is, away out there on the\r\nstarboard quarter, in his dyin' flurry!\"  And, sure enough, there the\r\nbrute was, on the surface, about a hundred and fifty yards away,\r\ntwisting and splashing in the midst of a boil of pink foam; and a few\r\nminutes later the struggles ceased altogether, and the monster floated\r\nquiescent and awash, dead, one of its great pectoral fins and a narrow\r\nstrip of its white belly just showing above the surface.  I was terribly\r\nafraid that the smell of blood, and of the dead carcass, would attract\r\nother sharks to the neighbourhood, and so further imperil Cunningham's\r\nsafety--for sharks are reputed to possess an extraordinarily keen scent;\r\nbut nothing of the kind happened.  The dead shark slowly drifted away\r\nand was finally lost sight of, and we finished our day's work without\r\nfurther interruption.\r\n\r\nThus matters went steadily on for a fortnight, by which time we had\r\naccumulated some three hundred and eighty thousand oysters, and had laid\r\nthem out upon the island to undergo the process of decay in the\r\nscorching rays of the sun.  And that they were undergoing that process\r\nat a very rapid rate our olfactory nerves soon informed us; for the\r\nodour of them became perceptible as early as the fourth day, while by\r\nthe end of the fortnight it was so strong as to be scarcely endurable\r\neven on the oyster bank itself, which was about a mile to leeward of the\r\nisland, although, by berthing the schooner every night right up in the\r\nweather corner of the lagoon, we managed to avoid getting more than an\r\noccasional whiff of it during the hours devoted to rest.\r\n\r\nBy the end of the fortnight, however, we discovered that even the\r\naccumulation of wealth by scooping up pearl-oysters from the bottom of\r\nthe sea may become monotonous after a while, especially when the\r\naccumulation is for somebody else's benefit; therefore, with one accord,\r\nwe petitioned \"Old Man\" Brown to give us a change of occupation by\r\nallowing us to amuse ourselves searching for pearls among the rotting\r\nfish, which now covered a considerable portion of the leeward half of\r\nthe island.  And Brown gladly jumped at the proposal; for he was every\r\nday growing more anxious lest the _Kingfisher_ and her crew of \"toughs\"\r\nshould heave in sight and become troublesome, and was more than willing\r\nto make sure of such spoil as we had already accumulated.  Therefore, on\r\na certain morning, instead of getting the schooner under way and\r\nproceeding to the oyster bank, as usual, the longboat was hauled\r\nalongside, and, attired in our very oldest clothes, armed with a ship's\r\nbucket each, and provided with a plentiful supply of disinfectant cloths\r\nto fasten over our mouths and nostrils upon reaching the field of\r\naction, all hands of us, except the cook and the cabin boy, got into her\r\nand pulled away for the shore.\r\n\r\nThe air was literally darkened by the immense numbers of birds that had\r\nreturned to the island, attracted by the odour, after having been driven\r\noff, and we soon saw that a few of the bolder of them had summoned up\r\ncourage to settle among our oysters, despite the scarecrow which we had\r\nset up; but they took to flight immediately upon our approach, and\r\nhovered over us all day, uttering their melancholy cries with such\r\npersistency, and creating such a volume of sound, that we could scarcely\r\nhear our own voices.\r\n\r\nHowever, we were there not to talk but to work.  Upon stepping ashore\r\nthe first thing we did, after securing the boat, was to fill our buckets\r\nwith clean salt water, in which to wash and deposit any pearls that we\r\nmight find; next we swathed our mouths and nostrils with the\r\ndisinfecting cloths; and then, told off by the skipper, each of us took\r\na row of the decaying fish and proceeded to search carefully the putrid\r\nmatter for what many people regard as the most lovely gems in the world.\r\n\r\nThere is no need for me to dilate upon the disagreeable, not to say\r\ndisgusting nature of the task upon which we now found ourselves engaged;\r\nit may safely be left to the imagination of the reader, and I will\r\ncontent myself with merely placing upon record the fact that it was\r\ninfinitely worse than even Cunningham or I had anticipated--and we\r\nbelieved that we had gauged the objectionable character of the work\r\npretty accurately.  But, so far at least as I was concerned, I soon\r\nforgot the sickeningly offensive nature of my work in the interest\r\nattaching to it, for I had not been five minutes engaged upon it when I\r\ncame upon a most superb pearl, perfectly globular in shape, with the\r\nexquisite sheeny lustre peculiar to gems of what are termed the first\r\nwater, and, as nearly as might be, an inch in diameter.  Such a find as\r\nthis was more than enough to make me forget all the disagreeableness of\r\nthe work upon which I was engaged, and to stimulate my curiosity to its\r\nhighest pitch.  Accordingly I proceeded with zest, and within an hour\r\nhad secured a round dozen of good-sized pearls--although none of them\r\napproached the first in size--together with a sufficient quantity of\r\nsmaller pearls to fill about one-third of an ordinary half-pint tumbler.\r\nNor was this first hour of mine an exceptionally fortunate one, for\r\nwhen we knocked off work at the end of the day my total find amounted to\r\nno less than one hundred and seven pearls, ranging in size from half an\r\ninch in diameter up to a monster that measured just over an inch and a\r\nquarter, while of smaller gems I had more than sufficient to fill two\r\ntumblers.  And when we all came to compare notes together upon our\r\nreturn on board I found that I was by no means the most fortunate one of\r\nthe party, the skipper's total and those of three of the forecastle\r\nhands considerably exceeding mine in quantity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER EIGHT.\r\n\r\nTHE \"KINGFISHER\" OF NANTUCKET.\r\n\r\nIt was on the third day of our repulsive work among the decaying oysters\r\nthat the expected happened.  We were all assiduously at work as usual,\r\ngroping with our fingers among the rotting fish for the sudden sensation\r\nof hardness which proclaimed the presence of the gems, when one of the\r\nparty, straightening himself up for a moment to take the kinks out of\r\nhis backbone, let out a sudden yell of: \"Sail ho!\"\r\n\r\n\"Where away?\" demanded the skipper, starting to his feet and staring\r\nabout him; and in a moment all hands of us were standing up and\r\nfollowing the \"Old Man's\" example.  There was no need for a reply to the\r\nskipper's question, for we had but to look to see the stranger\r\ninstantly--a topsail-schooner, about five miles distant, coming up from\r\nthe southward, close-hauled, under a press of sail.\r\n\r\nBrown stood staring intently at her for a full minute or more; then he\r\nshouted:\r\n\r\n\"Yes, that's the gol-darned _Kingfisher_, right enough, ne'er a doubt of\r\nit!  All hands to the boat, and let's get off to the _Marthy_.  I\r\nwouldn't be a bit surprised if that Slocum and his crowd tries to make\r\ntrouble when they find us here before 'em.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why do you think so, Captain?\" demanded Cunningham.  \"Surely there are\r\nenough oysters here for both of us, aren't there?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, yes, I reckon there are,\" agreed Brown, somewhat doubtfully.\r\n\"But I guess Slocum won't think so; he'll want the whole blamed lot.\"\r\n\r\nI thought this rather good, remembering, as I did, that previous to our\r\narrival, and before we knew how extensive was the bed, the skipper had\r\nbeen straining every nerve to reach the island before his rival, with\r\nthe avowed intention of sweeping the shoal clean if he could before the\r\narrival of the _Kingfisher_.  I said nothing, however, but, seizing the\r\nbucket containing the pearls which I had gathered during the morning,\r\nhastened away with the others toward where the longboat was moored.  The\r\nmoment that the last man was in we cast off, threw out our oars, and\r\ngave way for our own vessel, for the stranger was coming up hand over\r\nfist, and Brown was very anxious to be on board before the arrival of\r\nthe _Kingfisher_, in order that he might be fully prepared for all\r\neventualities.\r\n\r\nWe reached the _Martha_ a few minutes before the stranger hove in stays\r\nto fetch the passage through the reef; and Brown at once went below,\r\ntaking with him a couple of hands, routed out the arms and ammunition\r\nchests, and served out to each man a gun, a brace of Colt revolvers, and\r\na cutlass, together with a liberal supply of ammunition for the\r\nfirearms, at the same time instructing us to load our weapons and have\r\nthem ready for instant use, but to keep them out of sight until it\r\nbecame apparent that they would be required.\r\n\r\nBy the time that our preparations were complete, the stranger--now\r\nidentifiable beyond all question as the _Kingfisher_, since she carried\r\nher name legibly painted in white letters upon her head-boards--had\r\npassed through the reef and, taking in her canvas as she came, was\r\nsteering for a berth about a cable's length from where the _Martha_ lay;\r\nand a few minutes later she put down her helm, came head to wind, and\r\npresently let go her anchor.  Meanwhile the skipper, Cunningham, and I\r\nhad been diligently taking stock of her through our glasses, with the\r\nobject of ascertaining how many hands she carried, and we agreed that\r\nthere were but eight in sight, which, counting also the cook and\r\nsteward, gave her a complement of ten all told against fourteen of us,\r\nwhich fact caused our skipper to chuckle with satisfaction.\r\n\r\nThat we were not to be kept long in suspense with regard to the\r\nintentions of the newcomers soon became sufficiently evident, for the\r\n_Kingfisher_ had scarcely swung to her anchor when a dory was launched,\r\nand, with three people in her, two at the oars and the third sitting in\r\nthe sternsheets, came pulling toward the _Martha Brown_.\r\n\r\nFive minutes later the little craft swept up alongside, one of our\r\npeople hospitably dropped a rope's end into her to hang on by, and the\r\nman in the sternsheets--a long, angular, big-boned individual, about six\r\nfeet three inches in height, apparently about thirty-four years of age,\r\nwith a thick thatch of reddish-brown hair, and an equally thick beard\r\nand moustache of the same colour, and attired, despite the intense heat,\r\nin a heavy pilot cloth jacket and trousers, a blue worsted jersey, a fur\r\ncap, and sea-boots reaching above his knees--uncoiling his long limbs,\r\nrose in the boat, and, with a nimbleness strangely at variance with his\r\nungainly appearance, climbed the side, swung himself in over our low\r\nrail, and flung a quick, enquiring glance round the deck.\r\n\r\n\"Mornin'!\" he remarked briefly in a surly tone of voice to the skipper,\r\nCunningham, and myself, as we stepped forward to meet him.  \"I see this\r\nhere schooner's the _Marthy Brown_ o' Baltimore.  Which o' you 'uns is\r\nthe cap'n of her?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am,\" answered our \"Old Man,\" stepping forward.  \"Name of Ephraim\r\nBrown.  This here is my first officer, Mr Mark Temple, and this is Mr\r\nCunnin'ham, my second officer.\"\r\n\r\n\"Jerushy!  First and second officers, eh?\" exclaimed the stranger in a\r\nfine tone of irony.  \"My, but you air puttin' on style, Cap'n, and no\r\nmistake!  I'm plain Abner Slocum, cap'n and owner of the schooner\r\n_Kingfisher_, sailin' out o' Nantucket; and my first, second, third, and\r\nfourth mate is all rolled into one under the name o' Dan'l Greene.\r\nThat's him--the red-headed feller in the Scotch cap helpin' t'other 'un\r\nto roll up my schooner's mains'l.  Well, Cap'n Brown, I've took the\r\nliberty to come aboard your ship to ask what you happens to be doin'\r\nhere, if I ain't presumin' too much.\"\r\n\r\n\"May I ask what business that is of your'n, Cap'n--eh--um--Slocum?\"\r\ndemanded Brown blandly.\r\n\r\n\"Cert'nly you may,\" retorted Slocum, with elaborate politeness, which,\r\nhowever, vanished the next instant.  \"An' it won't take me half a second\r\nto answer ye,\" he continued truculently.  \"It's business o' mine because\r\nthis 'ere island, and everything in the sea for three mile round it,\r\nhappens to belong to me--left me by my deceased brother-in-law, Abr'am\r\nJohnson.  And I don't want, and won't have--you hear me!--won't have\r\nnobody trespassin' on my property.  So the sooner you 'uns gits, the\r\nbetter it'll be for all parties.  And now I hopes you understan's.  And\r\nthere's another thing.  By the all-fired smell o' that island I reckon\r\nthat you've been poachin' on my pearl-'yster bank.  Now, I dunno whether\r\nyou knows it or not, but by the laws of the United States of Ameriky\r\npearl poachin' is felony, and the poacher is liable to be put away for\r\nten years or so in Sing Sing.  But I don't want to be hard upon nobody;\r\nso if you'll just hand over to me the pearls that you've poached, I'm\r\nagreeable to let ye all go free, and say nothin' more about it.\"\r\n\r\n\"You don't say!\" ejaculated Brown, apparently overwhelmed by such royal\r\nclemency.  \"Well, then, I guess--But stop a minute; I sure was very near\r\nforgettin' something.  You say that this here island's yours, eh?  Well,\r\nthen, I s'pose you've got your title deeds and all that to prove it,\r\neh?\"\r\n\r\n\"Title deeds be--\" began Slocum, with an ugly snarl.  Then he pulled\r\nhimself up sharp.  \"I sure have, to hum,\" he answered.  \"But natchrally\r\nI didn't bring sich vallyable papers along with me, for fear of losin'\r\n'em.  And then again I didn't expect to find nobody here to dispute my\r\ntitle.  See?\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" said Brown, \"I don't see; and that's a solid fact.  What I do see\r\nis somethin' like this here.  I'm cruisin' in the Pacific in this here\r\nschooner o' mine, and one day we sights this here island, and comes in\r\nto have a look at it.  We lowers a boat and pulls ashore, and what do we\r\nfind?  We finds that the place is uninhabited, with nary a sign that\r\nanybody's ever set eyes on it before.  Anyway, it's uninhabited, and\r\nit's miles and miles away from any other land; therefore it don't belong\r\nto nobody, and accordin'ly I takes possession of it.  So you see, Cap'n,\r\nyou're all wrong about it bein' your'n.  It's mine; and if I was measly\r\nand cantankerous I'd prob'ly order you to take your schooner outer my\r\nharbour at once.  But I ain't that sorter man: I'm lib'ral and\r\nfree-handed to a fault; I ain't no greedy grab-all, not by a long chalk,\r\nso you may stay in this here harbour o' mine so long as you've a mind\r\nto.  But, you understan', you ain't none of yer to go ashore without my\r\nleave; an'--\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, shucks!\" interrupted Slocum in sudden fury.  \"What d'ye mean by\r\ngivin' me that sort o' mush?  I tell ye that this island is mine, and I\r\nmeans to have it.  And I means to have all the pearls that you've\r\npoached, too; and look 'e here, Mister, if you ain't out o' sight before\r\nnightfall, I'll--I'll--\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes; you'll--what?\" demanded the skipper calmly, seeing that the other\r\nhesitated.\r\n\r\n\"Why, I'll--I'll blow you and your blamed schooner and all hands of you\r\nto blazes!\" exploded Slocum.\r\n\r\n\"You will, eh?\" retorted Brown, slipping his right hand casually into\r\nhis jacket pocket.  \"Then--hands up, you skunk! hands up; and look spry\r\nabout it, or by the living Jingo I'll shoot!  Up with 'em, I say.  Ah!\r\nthat's better, a good deal!\" as Slocum slowly and reluctantly raised his\r\nhands above his head in response to our skipper's command, emphasised by\r\na levelled revolver which the \"Old Man\" had produced so rapidly that it\r\nwas quite like a conjuring trick.\r\n\r\n\"Now, Mr Temple,\" continued Brown, addressing me but keeping his eye\r\nunwaveringly upon his prisoner, \"just you go to the rail and persuade\r\nthem two in the dory to come up on deck; persuade 'em with yer gun if\r\nyou can't do it any other way.  I guess we'll have to go on usin' force,\r\nnow that this cantankerous cuss have obliged us to begin.  And you, Mr\r\nCunnin'ham, be good enough to pass the word for the carpenter to lay aft\r\nwi' three sets of irons.\"\r\n\r\n\"Here, I say, you monkey-faced old pirate, whatcher givin' us?  Whatcher\r\nmean by callin' for irons?  You don't mean ter say you're goin' to make\r\na prisoner of me, do yer?\" demanded Slocum, dropping his hands in his\r\nfury.\r\n\r\n\"Hands up!\" snapped the skipper, quick as lightning.  Then, as Slocum\r\nthrew them up again, he replied:\r\n\r\n\"Not goin' to make a prisoner of ye, eh?  You bet I sure am, then, you\r\nand the hull of your crowd, since you've come here spoilin' for trouble.\r\nBut I don't want no trouble myself, I ain't that sorter man; so I'm\r\ngoin' to keep you 'uns safe in irons until I've finished my business\r\nhere, a'ter which I'll release ye, and you can do what yer like.\"\r\n\r\n\"The fust thing I'll do when you release me is to blow the blamed head\r\noff your shoulders, ye all-fired pirate,\" snapped Slocum viciously.\r\n\r\n\"Put this man in irons,\" ordered Brown, as the carpenter came along, and\r\nthe next minute Slocum was fettered and Chips was overhauling him to\r\nmake sure that he had no concealed weapons about him.  Meanwhile I had\r\nsucceeded in \"persuading\" the two men who constituted the crew of the\r\ndory to leave their boat and come up on deck, and they, too, were\r\npromptly clapped in irons.  Thus we already had in our power three of\r\nthe _Kingfisher's_ complement of ten men all told, leaving seven, as\r\nopposed to our own fourteen.\r\n\r\n\"Take 'em away and confine 'em below in the fore peak,\" ordered Brown.\r\nAnd when this was done, \"I guess there's no sense in makin' two bites at\r\na cherry,\" observed the skipper.  \"We can't spare the time to fool\r\naround watchin' those fellers; so have the longboat hauled alongside,\r\nand let all hands except the cook and the cabin boy take their guns and\r\ncutlasses and get down into her.  We'll just meander across and take\r\nthat there _Kingfisher_ right away, so savin' a heap o' trouble in the\r\nlong run.  And while we're doing that, `the Doctor' and the boy'll stay\r\nhere and keep an eye on the chaps down below.\"\r\n\r\nSo said, so done; we secured possession of the _Kingfisher_ without any\r\ndifficulty, for although her crew guessed our errand the moment that\r\nthey saw us coming, they could not very well help themselves, such\r\nweapons as the Nantucket craft was provided with being stowed away and\r\nlocked up in Slocum's own cabin, where the crew could not get at them\r\nexcept by breaking down the door.  But apart from that, they had no\r\nstomach for fighting in the absence of Slocum, and they surrendered\r\nimmediately upon being ordered to do so, although, it must be confessed,\r\nwith not too good a grace.  Having thus secured possession of the\r\n_Kingfisher_, the next thing that we did was to give her another fifty\r\nfathoms of cable, so that she would ride easily and without being\r\nwatched in any weather that we were likely to have; after which her\r\ncrew, having previously been searched and deprived of everything that\r\ncould by any chance be utilised as a weapon, were ordered down into the\r\nlongboat, taken aboard the _Martha_, clapped in irons, and put down\r\nbelow into the fore peak along with Slocum and the two men out of the\r\ndory, one of our own men being detailed each day afterwards to mount\r\nguard over them while the rest of us resumed operations ashore.\r\n\r\nIt cost us three weeks of strenuous work to complete the examination of,\r\nand extract the pearls from the oysters that it had taken us a fortnight\r\nto fish up from the bottom of the sea, and when we had finished even the\r\nskipper confessed himself satisfied, so great had been our success.\r\nYet, although Brown was so far satisfied that he was content to leave\r\nthe remainder of the oysters to Slocum, he could not bring himself to\r\nleave behind the empty shells from which we had extracted the pearls;\r\npearl shell, he informed us, was worth so many dollars--I forget how\r\nmany--per ton in New York, and it would pay him well to take in all that\r\nwe had--discarding an equal weight of ballast--and carry it there.  The\r\ntask of cleaning, carrying on board, and storing this shell--including\r\nthe turning out of cargo and the discharge of ballast to make room for\r\nit--occupied us another fortnight; consequently by the time that all was\r\ndone and we were ready to sail again we had been close upon two months\r\nat the island.  Then, upon a certain lovely morning, we loosed and set\r\nour canvas and hove short; after which the crew of the _Kingfisher_,\r\nSlocum included, were brought up on deck, ordered over the side into the\r\nlongboat, and transferred to their own vessel, one man being released\r\nfrom his irons as soon as the transfer had been effected, in order that\r\nhe in turn might release the others.  And while this was being done the\r\nlongboat returned to the _Martha Brown_ and was hoisted in; after which\r\nwe tripped our anchor, hove it up to the bows, and stood out to sea.\r\n\r\nThe ensuing three months were more or less pleasantly and uneventfully\r\nspent in cruising hither and thither among the various groups of\r\nislands, seeking sandalwood, some of the natives proving exceedingly\r\nfriendly and agreeable to deal with, while others were very much the\r\nreverse.  By the end of that time we had accumulated a very fair\r\nquantity of the wood, and Brown had arrived at the conclusion that one\r\nmore call would about suffice to complete our cargo.  The question which\r\nthen arose was, where should that call be made? for we had pretty well\r\ncompleted the round of the islands and exhausted their capabilities of\r\nsupply, sandalwood happening to be rather scarce that year, while the\r\ndemand for it had been unusually brisk, a frequent experience of ours\r\nbeing that other traders had been beforehand with us and had taken all\r\nthat the islanders had for disposal.  Finally, while ashore one day on\r\nthe island of Tahiti, the skipper happened to overhear two men\r\ndiscussing sandalwood together, one of whom remarked to the other that\r\nthere was still some wood to be obtained at the island of Roua Poua, one\r\nof the Marquesas group; and two hours later we were under weigh, bound\r\nfor that same island.\r\n\r\nNow at that time the Marquesas natives bore a somewhat shady character,\r\nit being said of them that they were rather inclined to be treacherous\r\nwhen the opportunity to be so was afforded them; therefore when, on our\r\nfourth day out from Tahiti, we sighted Roua Poua, we approached the\r\nisland with all due precaution, every man of us being fully armed, with\r\norders to use his weapons freely upon the slightest provocation.  It was\r\ndusk when we arrived and let go our anchor under the lee of the island,\r\nand by the skipper's order the sails were merely hauled down or brailed\r\nup, as the case might be, all ready for setting again at a moment's\r\nnotice, while the twenty-five fathom shackle of the cable was kept just\r\ninside the hawse pipe, with the pin loosened and ready to be knocked out\r\ninstantly, in case it should become necessary to slip.\r\n\r\nThe anchor had scarcely splashed into the placid waters of the bay when,\r\nas in the case of most of the other islands visited, the schooner was\r\nsurrounded by a round dozen or more canoes, manned by from two to five\r\nmen, all anxious to be allowed to come alongside and barter the fruit or\r\nfish which they had brought off from the shore.  They appeared to be\r\nfine stalwart fellows, and were unarmed, so far as we could see; but the\r\nskipper would not allow any of them to come alongside that night, and\r\nthey returned good-humouredly enough to the shore after they had\r\nreceived permission to come off again the next morning.  A strict anchor\r\nwatch was maintained that night, but no canoes came near us, nor did\r\nanything occur to lead us to suppose that the natives meditated\r\ntreachery toward us.\r\n\r\nWhen they again came off at daylight on the following morning, although\r\nthere were something like thirty canoes surrounding the schooner, each\r\nmanned, as before, by from two to five men, they made no attempt to\r\nforce their way alongside, but lay off at a distance of two or three\r\nfathoms, the men holding up their wares for our inspection and shouting\r\ntheir merits in that singular \"pidgin\" which passes for English among\r\nthe Polynesians.  And when at length Brown selected a particular canoe,\r\nthe assortment of fruit in which appeared to be of a temptingly varied\r\ncharacter, and ordered her owner to come alongside, the rest, instead of\r\nexhibiting anger or jealousy, simply pelted the fortunate competitor\r\nwith good-natured chaff, and, taking to their paddles, headed for the\r\nshore, well knowing that the crew of so small a craft as the _Martha\r\nBrown_ would have no custom to spare for more than one well-laden canoe.\r\nAnd even when the selected canoe came alongside, only two out of her\r\ncrew of four offered to board us, the other two remaining in the canoe\r\nto pass up, as ordered by the owner, the various commodities which he\r\nhad for sale.  These commodities, by the way, consisted of fruits of\r\nvarious descriptions, eggs, chickens of astounding skinniness, and a\r\nhalf-grown porker, and the prices demanded, in what the skipper termed\r\n\"truck\", were so ridiculously low that in the course of an hour's lively\r\nbargaining we completely emptied the canoe of her contents.\r\n\r\nWhen at length the bargaining was concluded, and the savage salesman was\r\nabout to depart, he turned to the skipper and asked, in particularly\r\ngood English:\r\n\r\n\"You stop it here long, Cap'n?\"\r\n\r\n\"What business is that of your'n, sonny?\" retorted Brown, his suspicions\r\nsuddenly awakened again.\r\n\r\n\"Name it me Oahika, not `sonny', Cap'n,\" returned the savage.  \"If\r\nschooner stop it here, Oahika like it come off every day, bring it\r\nplenty fine fruit fresh fis' chicken-an-egg.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, that's your game, is it?\" observed Brown, reassured.  \"Want the\r\napp'intment of bumboat man in or'nary to this here schooner, eh?\"\r\n\r\nOahika's reply consisted merely of a good-humoured grin, which exhibited\r\na remarkably fine set of teeth, deeply stained with betel nut.  Probably\r\nhis comprehension of \"Old Man\" Brown's question was of the slenderest.\r\nThe skipper, however, accepted the grin as an affirmative, and\r\ngraciously remarked:\r\n\r\n\"Very well, then; you can come off again to-morrow, and see if we wants\r\nanything else.  And say, the next time that you brings off chickens, let\r\n'em be chickens, not livin' skelintons.  You sabby?\"\r\n\r\nAgain Oahika smiled, the smile of the man who wishes to convey the\r\nimpression that he \"sabbys\" perfectly, while in reality he does nothing\r\nof the kind.\r\n\r\n\"That's all right, then,\" continued Brown.  \"Now you can git away ashore\r\nagin as fast as you like, for we're goin' to be busy here.\"\r\n\r\nThe native, who probably comprehended the skipper's gestures better than\r\nhe did his words, at once turned and made toward the rail, but was\r\nrecalled by Brown, who enquired, in an offhand, casual sort of way:\r\n\r\n\"Say, you, Oah--what's-your-name--you don't happen to have no sandalwood\r\nashore there, I s'pose?\"\r\n\r\n\"Sandalwood!\" repeated the savage.  \"I think it some mans got a leetle.\r\nYou want it sandalwood, Cap'n?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I guess I could do with a little, if there was any goin' cheap,\"\r\nreturned the skipper.\r\n\r\n\"You like it me ask them mans come see you, Cap'n?\" demanded Oahika.\r\n\r\n\"Well, yes, I guess you may,\" replied the skipper.  \"Ask 'em to come off\r\nto-morrow mornin', bringin' the wood with 'em, and tell 'em that if\r\nthey're willin' to let it go cheap I'll buy it off 'em.\"\r\n\r\nThe savage intimated in his own peculiar fashion that it would afford\r\nhim much pleasure to perform this trifling service for his esteemed\r\nfriend and patron, and then took his leave, grinning with apparent\r\nsatisfaction at the result of his morning's work.  The skipper stood\r\nwatching the progress of the canoe until she had nearly reached the\r\nshore, and then he turned to me and remarked:\r\n\r\n\"I guess there's been a mistake somewhere about these here Marquesas\r\nnatives.  They don't seem to me to be so very partic'lar treacherous.\r\nHow do they strike you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why,\" said I, \"I have been amusing myself by very closely watching\r\nthose two who were aboard, and I am bound to admit that their behaviour\r\nseemed quite unexceptionable.  I mean,\" I continued, noticing a slightly\r\npuzzled look on my companion's face, \"they seemed to behave pretty much\r\nlike the natives of most of the other islands which we have visited,\r\nexcept that they did not attempt to steal anything.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yep, I guess I noticed that too,\" observed the skipper.  \"Well,\" he\r\ncontinued, \"we'll just go on keepin' our eyes open for a bit, but I\r\ndon't reckon upon our findin' ourselves up agin anything so very serious\r\nin this here island.\"\r\n\r\nBrown had given our chocolate-coloured visitors to understand that we\r\nwere to have a busy day aboard the schooner; but as a matter of fact\r\nthat statement was merely an attempt to \"bluff\" the natives, \"bluffing\"\r\nhaving latterly become almost an instinctive act with the skipper.\r\nHowever, although we had nothing very particular to do we at least made\r\na show of great industry, easing up and overhauling rigging, renewing\r\nchafing mats, and so on, Brown's notion being to convey to the natives\r\nthe idea that we had called in to overhaul and refit, rather than that\r\nwe were in quest of sandalwood; by which ruse I think he hoped to get\r\nthe wood at a somewhat cheaper rate than usual.\r\n\r\nOn the following morning Oahika and his crew came off to us again,\r\nbringing more fruit, a small quantity of vegetables, about a dozen eggs,\r\nand two animated barn-door skeletons which the skipper positively\r\nrefused to purchase at any price.  And with them came four other canoes,\r\neach of which had some eight or ten sticks of sandalwood in her.\r\n\r\n\"Hullo!\" exclaimed the skipper, when he saw this display, \"what in the\r\nnation do they mean by bringin' off them scraps?  Is it to show us the\r\nsort o' stuff that they have to sell, I wonder?  Hi, you!\"--to\r\nOahika--\"what have them fellers brought off that wood for?\"\r\n\r\n\"Sandalwood, that,\" explained the savage.  \"They want it sell dem wood\r\nyou.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sell!\" ejaculated the skipper; \"sell!  Why, there ain't enough wood\r\nthere to light a fire with.  Is that all that they've got?--because\r\nthere ain't enough there to make it worth my while to open out my\r\n`truck'.  I wouldn't give one bandanner handkercher for the whole measly\r\nlot!\"\r\n\r\nOahika conferred with his friends for a while, and then turned to the\r\nskipper.\r\n\r\n\"Mans say,\" he explained, \"that dem wood all it got cut.  Plenty more\r\nyonder,\" pointing generally toward the shore.  \"They say s'pose you want\r\nit more wood, you go 'shore and show it dem how much you want, and mans\r\ncut it for you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I'm jiggered!\" exclaimed the skipper explosively.  \"If I'd ha'\r\nknowed that them few twigs was all that the lazy skunks had got cut,\r\nd'ye think I'd ha' brought the _Marthy_ all this way out of her road to\r\nbuy it?  No, sirree, not by a jugful!  But,\" he continued, his wrath\r\nsubsiding as rapidly as it had blazed up, \"seein' that we're here I\r\ns'pose the best thing for me to do'll be to go ashore, have a look at\r\nthat there wood, and see if I kin strike a bargain on it.  'T all\r\nevents, if I do that I'll be able to choose the best wood they have,\r\n'nstead of buyin' just any blamed stuff that they like to bring off to\r\nme.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you think it will be wise to trust yourself ashore alone with those\r\nfellows?\"  I asked.  \"You must remember that we have seen very little of\r\nthem, thus far; and it will be well to keep in mind, too, the fact that\r\nthey have rather an unenviable reputation for treachery.  Why not order\r\nso many canoe-loads of wood from them, and let it go at that?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well--no--I guess not,\" answered the skipper.  \"If I do that they'll\r\nwork off all their worst stuff on me, and I'll just have to take it or\r\ngo without.  No; I reckon I'll go ashore and pick my own wood: then I\r\nshall know that I'm gettin' full vally for my money.  But I won't go\r\nalone; I guess I'll take two hands with me, and we'll go fully armed.  I\r\ndon't believe in takin' no unnecessary risks.\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" I agreed; \"there is no sense in that sort of thing.  Who will you\r\ntake with you?  Would you care to have Mr Cunningham and myself with\r\nyou?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, I guess not,\" answered Brown with decision.  \"I'll take Mr\r\nCunnin'ham and one o' the foremast hands with me; but you'll stay here,\r\nMr Temple, and look a'ter the ship.  And I guess I'll go right now;\r\nthen we shall be able to get back in time for dinner.  Now, let's see;\r\nI'll have Mr Cunnin'ham for one, as I said, and--yes, Joe Maybury'll do\r\nvery well for t'other.  Just give them two their instructions, Mr\r\nTemple, will ye.  I'll be ready to go in ten minutes; and I guess we'll\r\ngo in the jollyboat.\"\r\n\r\nI found Cunningham and explained the situation to him, and he was,\r\nnaturally, delighted at the idea of having a run ashore; but I warned\r\nhim to keep his weather eye lifting, and to take a couple of fully\r\nloaded revolvers with him, as well as plenty of cartridges, and a\r\ncutlass.  Then I found Maybury, and gave him similar instructions,\r\nwinding up by telling off three more men to go in the jollyboat and\r\nbring her back as soon as she had landed her passengers.  Ten minutes\r\nlater the little expedition started, and I stood and watched them as\r\nthey pulled away for the beach, accompanied by the five canoes which had\r\ncome off to us half an hour earlier.\r\n\r\nAs they drew in toward the shore I perceived, with a momentary qualm of\r\nuneasiness, that quite a considerable number of natives was turning out\r\nto meet them; but upon bringing the ship's telescope to bear upon the\r\nbeach my uneasiness was to a considerable extent dissipated, for I then\r\nsaw that the crowd was largely composed of women and children, while, so\r\nfar as I could see, none of the men carried anything resembling a\r\nweapon.  Also I was unable to detect any sign of hostility or excitement\r\non the faces of the natives; on the contrary, they all appeared to be\r\nsmiling with the utmost good humour, and as Cunningham stepped out of\r\nthe boat I saw one _cafe au lait_ coloured young minx dart forward and\r\nlaughingly throw a garland of gay-tinted flowers round his neck.  The\r\nscreech of delight with which this achievement was greeted reached my\r\nears even where I was, a good half mile from the beach.  The laughing,\r\nshouting crowd then closed in upon the newcomers, and once again I\r\nbecame a trifle anxious; but presently I caught a glimpse of\r\nCunningham's smiling countenance in the midst of the crowd, and a minute\r\nor two later the skipper and his bodyguard emerged, and, accompanied by\r\nthe sandalwood merchants, walked off up a footpath that vanished among\r\nthe trees within fifty yards of the shore.\r\n\r\nThen, to my annoyance, the natives gathered round the boat, and the\r\ncrew, instead of returning forthwith, as I had instructed them to do,\r\nlaid in their oars, stepped out of her on to the sand, and proceeded\r\ninterestedly to inspect various articles which the savages seemed to be\r\nurging them to purchase.  As I continued to watch them through the glass\r\nI saw first one of our men and then another emerge from the crowd, go to\r\nthe boat, and carefully deposit something--probably a \"curio\" of some\r\nkind--in her sternsheets, and then rejoin the laughing, gesticulating\r\nthrong.  This went on for something like twenty minutes, by the end of\r\nwhich time my patience was quite exhausted; and I directed one of the\r\nhands to get out the ensign and bend it on to the main signal halyards\r\nwhile I went below to get a gun, intending to hoist the ensign and at\r\nthe same time fire the gun in the air as a signal of recall to the\r\nrecalcitrant boat's crew.  But when I returned on deck with the loaded\r\nweapon I was just in time to see the entire crowd retiring up the\r\npathway, leaving the boat abandoned on the shore, with about a foot of\r\nher forefoot hauled up on the beach and her painter made fast to one of\r\nher stretchers, which had been thrust like a peg for about half its\r\nlength into the sand!\r\n\r\nThe man who was standing by to hoist the ensign grinned as he caught my\r\neye.  \"I guess them three jokers have toddled off up to the village,\" he\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\nBut I had my doubts, and did not like the appearance of things at all;\r\nmy former suspicions rushed back with redoubled force, and--\r\n\r\n\"Hoist away that ensign,\" I said curtly; and as the man began to pull\r\nupon the halyards I lifted the gun to my shoulder, and, pointing it well\r\nout to seaward, pulled the trigger.  By the time that the smoke cleared\r\naway not a native was to be seen!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER NINE.\r\n\r\nTREACHERY!\r\n\r\nMy first feeling was one of simple annoyance with the three men who\r\nconstituted the boat's crew, because they had permitted themselves to be\r\ncajoled into visiting the village and leaving the boat unprotected upon\r\nthe beach, instead of returning to the ship immediately after landing\r\nthe skipper, as I had instructed them to do.  But when a full hour had\r\nelapsed, with no sign of the return of the truants, my annoyance began\r\nto give place to a feeling of rapidly growing anxiety; and when that\r\nhour grew to two, with still no sign of the absentees, my anxiety merged\r\ninto a feeling of downright alarm--nay, more than alarm, into a\r\nconviction that something very serious had happened.\r\n\r\nAnd now I found myself in an exceedingly awkward predicament; for while\r\nI felt that something ought to be done, I could not, for the life of me,\r\ndecide what that something should be.  Two alternatives suggested\r\nthemselves, one being to arm all hands to the teeth, launch the gig, and\r\ngo ashore to investigate; while the other was to remain aboard and\r\nprepare the schooner in every possible way to repel an attack, and at\r\nthe same time to have everything ready for flight at a moment's notice,\r\nif need be.  The former was undoubtedly the proper thing to do, if one\r\nwere to act upon the assumption that the natives had seized the white\r\nmen who had landed, and were holding them as prisoners; but such an\r\nassumption was scarcely justified by the reputation which the Marquesas\r\nnatives had earned for themselves, the story in circulation with regard\r\nto them being to the effect that it was their custom promptly to kill\r\nand eat any unfortunate whites who chanced to fall into their hands.  If\r\nthe six men who had been decoyed ashore that morning were already dead,\r\nnothing was to be gained by landing the remainder of the _Martha's_\r\ncrew, except the infliction upon the natives of a sharp punishment--at a\r\nconsiderable amount of risk to ourselves of further loss in the pitched\r\nbattle which would assuredly ensue.\r\n\r\nAlso there was the possibility--nay, more, the very strong probability--\r\nthat while we were busily engaged on shore in the attempt to administer\r\nsalutary chastisement for the betrayal of our shipmates, a party of\r\nnatives might board the unprotected schooner, slip her cable, and run\r\nher ashore; and then where should we be, with no means of retreat\r\nexcepting our boats, which would doubtless also be seized?  If we could\r\nonly get hold of a native and ascertain from him what had become of the\r\nabsentees we should know what to do: for if the missing men were merely\r\nprisoners we should be fully justified in taking the risk of attempting\r\nto rescue them; but if, on the other hand, they were already dead, the\r\nquestion of punishment might very well be left until a more fitting\r\nmoment.  But now there was not a solitary native to be seen anywhere,\r\nwhich, in my opinion, was a decidedly bad sign.\r\n\r\nThe arrival of noon--by which hour the skipper fully expected to be back\r\naboard the ship, but was not--found me still undecided upon the question\r\nof landing; but I had so far made up my mind that I had determined to\r\narm all hands and put the schooner into as efficient a state of defence\r\nas possible.  Accordingly I gave orders to have the arms and ammunition\r\nchests brought on deck, and instructed each man--there were only eight\r\nof us, all told, now--to arm himself with a cutlass and a brace of fully\r\nloaded revolvers, and also to have a loaded gun where he could put his\r\nhand upon it at a moment's notice.  Next I caused all fore-and-aft\r\ncanvas to be loosed, all downhauls cast off, and all halyards ready for\r\nhoisting away at a moment's notice; and when these orders had been duly\r\nexecuted it seemed to me that we had done everything that was possible.\r\n\r\nYet the schooner was still in a very defenceless condition, so far as\r\nresisting the simultaneous attack of several hundred determined natives\r\nwas concerned: we might empty our firearms upon them, and if every shot\r\ntold--which was most unlikely, in the excitement attendant upon an\r\nattack--we should kill or wound precisely fifty-six of them; after which\r\nthe eight of us would be fighting, hand to hand, with the remainder, who\r\nwould outnumber us by at least twenty to one, and probably twice that\r\nnumber!  What chance would we have under such conditions as those?\r\nAbsolutely none at all.  If, now, it were possible to raise the\r\nschooner's bulwarks, or to render them unclimbable in some way!\r\n\r\nAs I considered this the thought of the trawl net which the skipper had\r\nbrought along for the purpose of dredging up the pearl-oysters occurred\r\nto me, and I instantly decided that it might, with a little ingenuity,\r\nbe converted into an excellent boarding netting.  It was made of extra\r\nstout hemp line, to resist the cutting action of the oyster shells over\r\nwhich it was proposed to be dragged, and also to bring up a good heavy\r\nload without bursting, and I at once recognised that if there was enough\r\nof it to trice up all round the schooner--and I believed there was--it\r\nmight serve to keep the natives off our decks long enough to enable us\r\nto give them so severe a punishing as to cool their ardour effectually\r\nand ultimately beat them off.  The idea was too good not to be utilised\r\nat once; and I gave instructions to have the net immediately routed out\r\nand brought on deck.  It was a big, heavy affair, and it took the eight\r\nof us the best part of half an hour to clear it out of the sail-room and\r\nget it on deck; but when at length we had done so I at once saw that,\r\nwith a certain amount of cutting and contriving, it might be made to\r\nserve its new purpose very excellently: and forthwith all hands of us\r\nfell upon it, and by eight bells in the afternoon watch had converted it\r\ninto an exceedingly efficient boarding net.  Then we triced it up, and\r\nfelt that at last we were ready for whatever the fates--and the\r\nnatives--might have in store for us.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the jollyboat still lay abandoned upon the beach, and no sign\r\nof her crew or of the skipper and his two companions had been seen; nor\r\nhad the strictest scrutiny, with the aid of the ship's telescope,\r\nrevealed any indication of natives ashore: in fact, so far as\r\nappearances alone were concerned, the island might have been\r\nuninhabited.  But the continued absence of our shipmates, now prolonged\r\nfar beyond all reasonable limits, left no doubt in any of our minds that\r\nsomething very seriously wrong had happened to them; and but for the\r\ncircumstance that we were in complete ignorance as to what that\r\nhappening really was, and the hope that some of them at least might\r\nstill be alive, I would at once have got the schooner under way and gone\r\nto sea.  But to do that was impossible while their fate was still in\r\ndoubt; for not even to ensure our own safety against the attack that we\r\nwere all convinced was impending could we do that which would amount to\r\nthe abandonment of possibly living white men to the mercy of the\r\nsavages.\r\n\r\nWith the tricing up and securing of the boarding netting our\r\npreparations for the defence of the schooner were completed to the best\r\nof our ability; and now all that remained was for us to sit down and\r\npassively await events, which, in the present case, meant an attack by\r\nthe savages at any moment after darkness had fallen sufficiently to\r\nconceal their movements.  But, that we might be as fully prepared as\r\npossible, I gave instructions for the advancement of the supper hour, so\r\nthat we might partake of that meal while there was still light enough to\r\nenable us to see our surroundings; and after that we busied ourselves\r\nabout a general straightening up of the decks and the removal of all\r\nunnecessary hamper, in order that, if fight we must, we might at least\r\nfight with clear decks.\r\n\r\nFortunately for us the night fell fine and clear, with brilliant\r\nstarlight which enabled us to see all round the ship for a distance of\r\nabout a couple of hundred yards; but inshore of us the shadow of the\r\nisland lay jet-black upon the surface of the water, completely hiding\r\nall evidence of movement in that direction, even when I attempted to\r\nprobe the blackness with the night glass.  Therefore we were obliged to\r\ntrust quite as much to our ears as to our eyes for warning of the\r\napproach of an enemy; but even they did not help us much, for the island\r\nwas but a small one, and the thunder of the surf upon its weather shore,\r\nborne to us with almost startling distinctness, mingled with the sough\r\nof the wind among the trees and the lap of the ripples alongside, making\r\nwith these a combination of sound that effectually screened any such\r\nmovement as the launching of a canoe or the distant dip of paddles.  I\r\nforesaw that this was likely to be a wakeful night for me, for with such\r\na heavy load of responsibility upon my young shoulders I could not\r\npossibly have slept, even upon a bed of down.  I therefore instructed\r\nthe men to bring their beds on deck and snatch such rest as might come\r\nto them, while I kept a lookout.  Also I made a point of striking the\r\nship's bell regularly every half-hour, in the faint hope that if the\r\nsavages could be brought to realise that we were upon the alert they\r\nmight, after all, decide not to risk an attack.\r\n\r\nWith incredible slowness the laggard moments passed; the second\r\ndog-watch came to an end; and then, still more slowly, as it seemed to\r\nmy impatience, first one, then two, three, four, and so on up to eight\r\nbells of the first watch were tolled out, and still there were no signs\r\nof the enemy.  And all this while I was continuously padding round the\r\ndecks in a pair of old felt-soled slippers, which effectually silenced\r\nmy footsteps upon the planking, pausing for a moment at every half-dozen\r\nsteps to peer anxiously but in vain into the shadow of the island for\r\nsome indication of movement.  Finally four bells of the middle watch\r\narrived, and their passage was duly recorded by the strokes of the\r\nship's bell.  Meanwhile the stress of the day's anxiety, combined with\r\nmy continuous and monotonous perambulation of the deck, and no doubt\r\nassisted by the soft coolness of the offshore breeze, laden with the\r\nodours of earth and vegetation, and the constant booming sound of the\r\ndistant surf, was beginning to tell upon me; my jarred nerves had become\r\nsteady, my breathing had become deep and regular, my limbs were growing\r\nweary, and my eyelids began occasionally to droop; in short, I was\r\nbeginning to feel fatigued and in need of sleep.\r\n\r\nThis, then, was evidently the moment at which to attempt to snatch a\r\nlittle rest, and I was debating within myself which of the men I should\r\ncall to relieve me, or rather which of them I could best trust to keep\r\nan alert lookout, when I fancied I caught, just for an instant out of\r\nthe corner of my eye, a faint, silvery gleam, as of the phosphorescence\r\nof disturbed water, deep in the heart of the darkest shadow in the\r\ndirection of the beach.  I looked more closely, and presently saw again,\r\nthis time quite distinctly, the rippling, moon-like gleam of water\r\ndisturbed as it might be by the launching of a boat or a canoe.  Yes,\r\nthere was no mistake about it, there was undoubtedly a movement of some\r\nsort in there; and even as I came to this conclusion I saw the thing\r\nrepeated twice, thrice, five or six times, with spaces of a few yards\r\nbetween.  That was enough; at last the savages were on the move, and in\r\na moment my fatigue fell from me like a garment, and I was once again\r\nthe incarnation of alertness.  Without making a sound I glided along the\r\ndeck in my old soft slippers, and, laying my hand lightly upon each\r\nsleeper's shoulder, murmured in his ear: \"The enemy is under way!  Go to\r\nyour station as noiselessly as possible, taking your gun with you; and\r\ndo not fire until I give the word.\"\r\n\r\nBy the time that I had awakened my little band, and had seen each man at\r\nhis proper station, it had become perfectly apparent that eight canoes\r\nwere stealing slowly out toward us from the beach; for although they\r\nwere still enveloped in deep shadow, and were being paddled so\r\ncautiously that not the faintest suspicion of a sound could be heard, it\r\nwas possible for us to see distinctly, in the midst of the blackness,\r\neight separate points of disturbance, each indicated by short, wavering\r\nlines of phosphorescent light, marking the slight ripple created by the\r\ngentle passage of some object through the water, in addition to which an\r\noccasional small luminous swirl indicated the stealthy dip of a paddle\r\nin the water at infrequent intervals.  The excessive caution with which\r\nthey were making their approach seemed to suggest an intention on the\r\npart of the savages to get as near as possible to the schooner\r\nunobserved, with probably a quick dash at the end to cover the last\r\nhundred feet or so of water.\r\n\r\nCrouching low behind the bulwarks, and levelling the ship's night glass\r\nover the rail, I kept the instrument slowly sweeping athwart the\r\nadvancing line of craft, and at length saw eight large canoes gradually\r\ntake shape as they drew imperceptibly out of the heart of the deepest\r\nshadow.  I endeavoured to count the number of occupants, but soon found\r\nthis to be impossible in the dim light.  I made a rough guess, however,\r\nand came to the conclusion that there were at least twenty in each\r\ncanoe; it was evident therefore that, despite our superiority in the\r\nmatter of weapons, there was a desperate struggle in store for us.  I\r\nwaited patiently until the canoes had approached us near enough to\r\nenable us to distinguish the loom of them with the unaided eye, and\r\nthen, springing up on the wheel grating, I suddenly hailed:\r\n\r\n\"Canoes ahoy!  Keep off there!  If you attempt to come any nearer I will\r\nopen fire upon you.\"\r\n\r\nA complete cessation of paddling immediately followed my hail.  Possibly\r\nthe savages were a trifle chagrined to discover that we were on the\r\nalert, or perhaps they did not fully understand what I had said--\r\nalthough I did not believe that, for most of the South Sea natives knew\r\nenough of English to enable an Englishman to make himself understood.\r\nBe that as it may, they paused long enough to enable me to call to the\r\nlittle band of defenders a final instruction.\r\n\r\n\"Don't fire, lads,\" I said, \"until you can see your mark distinctly.\r\nThen aim carefully, and make every shot tell.  Much will depend upon the\r\neffect of our first volley, which we must therefore make as deadly as\r\npossible.\"\r\n\r\nA low murmur of comprehension arose from the scanty crew ranged at wide\r\nintervals along the schooner's port rail, that being the side which the\r\nnatives were approaching.  But before anything more could be said, a\r\nloud shout--in a voice the tones of which seemed somehow familiar to\r\nme--arose from one of the canoes, and was instantly answered by a yell\r\nthat, from its volume of sound, must have emanated from the throats of\r\nnearly or quite two hundred savages; and then, without further attempt\r\nat concealment, a whole host of paddles suddenly dashed into the water,\r\nlashing it into long, swirling lines of luminous foam, and, with loud\r\ncries of mutual encouragement from the occupants, the eight big canoes\r\nsurged forward and came rushing through the water at the schooner.\r\n\r\n\"Keep cool, men,\" I shouted above the din: \"pick your mark; aim into the\r\nthick of them; and load and fire as many times as you can before they\r\ncan get alongside.\"  And forthwith I led off with a shot aimed straight\r\nat the centre of the dark mass which represented the nearest canoe, at\r\nthat moment distant about two hundred and fifty yards.  My aim was true,\r\nand my bullet must have found a double mark, for two distinct shrieks\r\nresponded a bare moment before a ragged volley of seven shots rang out\r\nfrom the rest of the defenders.  More shrieks followed this discharge,\r\nbut it did not stop the rush of the canoes, which now came sweeping\r\ntoward us like so many steamers.  Meanwhile I was busily engaged in\r\nslipping another cartridge into the breach of my piece, calculating upon\r\nbeing able to get in two more shots before the savages arrived\r\nalongside.  And so, as a matter of fact, I did, as also did some of the\r\nothers, with disastrous results for the savages, if the shrieks that\r\nfollowed upon each discharge were to be accepted as any criterion; and,\r\napart from that, there was a noticeable wavering and hesitation on the\r\npart of the crews of two or three of the canoes after that third\r\ndischarge.  But the hesitation was only momentary; then the rascals\r\ngripped their courage afresh and drove their canoes alongside, four\r\ndashing up on our port side, and the remaining four essaying to board us\r\nto starboard.  And when the canoes were within about four or five\r\nfathoms of the schooner's side, with good way upon them, the savages\r\nsuddenly laid in their paddles and, rising to their feet, hurled a heavy\r\nshower of spears at us, every one of which flew harmlessly over our\r\nheads, luckily for us.\r\n\r\nThen the heavy night air suddenly became vibrant with a medley of harsh,\r\ndiscordant sounds, compounded of the yells and shrieks of the savages,\r\nthe fierce ejaculations of our own people, the quick, snapping\r\nexplosions of revolvers, and the gasping groans of the wounded, as the\r\nnatives swarmed up our low sides and suddenly found themselves\r\nconfronted by the barrier of our improvised boarding net, through the\r\nmeshes of which our lads pointed their revolvers and thrust furiously\r\nwith their cutlasses, while the savages unavailingly strove to tear the\r\nstout strands apart and make an opening through which to pass, or thrust\r\nat us in their turn with their spears.  Suddenly, in the dim starlight,\r\nas I was busily reloading my revolver, I saw the cook emerge from the\r\ngalley with what looked like a bucket in his hand.  With a quick twirl\r\nhe seemed to throw the contents of this bucket through the net just\r\nwhere the savages were crowding thickest on the other side of it, and\r\nthe next instant there arose a more than usually piercing chorus of\r\nshrieks, while the great bulk of the savages at that particular point\r\nappeared to melt away suddenly, and I heard the heavy impact of a number\r\nof bodies falling headlong into the canoes alongside.\r\n\r\nThe \"Doctor\" paused a moment, apparently to note the effect of his\r\nexperiment, and then he hastily returned to the galley, presently\r\nemerging again and repeating his former tactics with similar results.  I\r\nsubsequently learned that, when it became known that an attack of the\r\nsavages might be certainly looked for, the cook had lighted a rousing\r\nfire in his galley, filled his coppers with a mixture of slush and salt\r\nwater, and brought the whole to the boil, so arranging the matter that\r\nthe mixture was in a state of furious ebullition by the time the savages\r\narrived alongside.  And wherever the blacks pressed thickest and most\r\ndeterminedly, there Cooky intervened with a bucketful of his scalding\r\nstuff, which he very effectively distributed over the naked bodies of a\r\nround dozen or so of our assailants by giving the bucket a neat twirl at\r\nthe instant of discharge.\r\n\r\nBut despite the effective aid thus rendered, matters were, on the whole,\r\ngoing rather badly for us, for two American forecastle hands were by\r\nthis time down, transfixed by spears which pinned them to the deck,\r\nwhile the sailmaker and I were each punctured and bleeding freely, Sails\r\nhaving received a bad prick in his left shoulder, while a spear had\r\npassed completely through the fleshy part of my right thigh; in addition\r\nto which a party of savages, by concentrating their efforts upon one\r\nparticular spot, had contrived to make a hole in the net, which they\r\nwere rapidly enlarging.  Of this last fact I was happily unaware, as\r\nindeed I was of the critical character of our situation generally, for\r\nit was forward, where Murdock, the ex-boatswain of the _Zenobia_, was in\r\ncharge, that matters were going so badly, while aft, where I was, we\r\nwere doing pretty well.\r\n\r\nBut Murdock was not the sort of man to be discouraged because for the\r\nmoment he happened to be getting the worst of it; on the contrary, it\r\nwas just that state of things that stirred him to extra effort, and it\r\ndid so now.  Perceiving that, unless something were done to prevent them\r\neffectively, the savages would soon force their way through the net--and\r\nthereafter make short work of all hands of us--Murdock sets his wits\r\ngoing, and presently thought out a plan which he immediately proceeded\r\nto put into operation.  Seizing a half-empty case of revolver\r\nammunition, he broke open about a dozen cartridges and arranged the\r\npowder in a little heap at the bottom of the case, burying one end of a\r\nlength of extemporised fuse in the heap.  Then he piled the cartridges\r\non the top of the heap, placed the case on the windlass bitts, ignited\r\nthe free end of the fuse, and rushed aft, yelling to us to throw\r\nourselves flat upon our faces as he did so.\r\n\r\nSo urgent was his call that we all instinctively obeyed it; and there we\r\nlay for perhaps ten or fifteen seconds, while the savages, seeing the\r\nweak point suddenly deserted, swarmed about it in greatly augmented\r\nnumbers, finally enlarging the hole in the net to such an extent that at\r\nlength it was big enough to permit the passage of a man, when one after\r\nanother they began to force their way through.  It was at this precise\r\nmoment that the spark of the burning fuse reached the powder, which of\r\ncourse instantly blew up, igniting the hundred or so of cartridges that\r\nremained in the case, and scattering the bullets in them in all\r\ndirections.  There was a quick flash of the ignited powder, immediately\r\nfollowed by the cracker-like reports of the exploding cartridges, a\r\nhorrible chorus of yells and shrieks of wounded men, and then--sudden,\r\ncomplete silence, for the space of perhaps half a dozen breaths.  Then\r\ncame renewed groans and outcries, as the injured men felt the first\r\nsmart of their wounds, followed by a sudden wailing cry, and with one\r\naccord the panic-stricken savages flung themselves back into their\r\ncanoes, seized their paddles, and headed for the shore in frantic haste,\r\nbeing presently sped upon their way by the bullets which we poured into\r\ntheir midst as long as they remained in sight.\r\n\r\nThen, and not until then, we laid aside our weapons, mopped the\r\nperspiration and powder grime from our streaming brows, bound up each\r\nother's wounds, and went forward to inspect the results of Murdock's\r\nlittle experiment.  It had been exceedingly effective, for scattered\r\nround the spot where the explosion had occurred we found no less than\r\nnineteen savages, of whom eleven were dead, five were more or less\r\nseverely wounded, and three appeared to be only stunned.  These three we\r\npromptly proceeded to bind hand and foot, during which operation we\r\ndiscovered that one of the trio was none other than friend Oahika, our\r\n\"bumboat man in or'nary\", as the skipper had styled him.  I was\r\nespecially glad that this particular rascal had fallen into our hands,\r\nfor during the progress of the fight I had frequently caught sight of\r\nhim, by the light afforded by the flash of our revolvers, and had\r\nnoticed that he was taking an exceptionally prominent part in the\r\nproceedings; while one or two circumstances which I had also noticed led\r\nme to suspect that he might possibly be a person of some importance\r\namong the natives of Roua Poua.\r\n\r\nAnd now, as with the assistance of three lanterns we proceeded with our\r\ninvestigations, the really desperate character of the struggle in which\r\nwe had so recently been engaged began to be borne in upon us; for, in\r\naddition to the nineteen who had fallen victims to the boatswain's\r\ncontrivance, we found scattered about the ship twenty-six dead, and\r\nthirty-three more or less wounded natives; while others--with whom the\r\nsharks were already busy--were floating in the water near the ship.  As\r\nfor ourselves, we had lost two foremast hands, both of them Americans,\r\nwhile the remainder of us, with the solitary exception of the cook, had\r\neach his scratch to show, my own and the sailmaker's being, fortunately,\r\nthe only wounds that could be reasonably termed serious, while even they\r\nwere of comparatively little moment, provided that gangrene did not\r\nsupervene.\r\n\r\nAnd now, the natives having been beaten off, our next task was to\r\nstraighten up after the fight, and a beginning was made by throwing all\r\nthe dead--except our own two--overboard, where the sharks might be\r\nsafely trusted to see to their speedy disposal.  Then we overhauled the\r\nwounded savages: and such of them as had received only trifling hurts,\r\nand might therefore perhaps yet give us trouble if we were not careful,\r\nwe bound securely; while the others we laid out on deck, and then\r\nproceeded to doctor up as well as our means and our very limited\r\nsurgical knowledge permitted.\r\n\r\nIt was while we were all thus busily engaged that the boatswain,\r\nhappening to straighten his back for a moment and cast an alert glance\r\nacross the water toward the shore, suddenly stood rigid and staring, and\r\nthen remarked to me, in a low tone of voice:\r\n\r\n\"Just look over there for a minute, Mr Temple.  Ain't that a canoe or\r\nsomethin' headin' this way?\"\r\n\r\nI looked in the direction indicated, and at once sighted a small,\r\nshapeless blot of deeper blackness in the shadow that enshrouded the\r\nwhole of the west side of the island.  But if it was a canoe it was\r\ncertainly a very small craft; moreover, it was not coming from the\r\ndirection of the beach, but from a point apparently about a mile to the\r\nnorth of it.  We stood watching it for a full minute, or more, and then\r\nI caught the now familiar phosphorescent gleam of water which indicated\r\nthe presence of a moving object.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" I said, \"it certainly is a canoe, Murdock; but she seems to be\r\nonly a very small affair, such as need give us no very serious amount of\r\nanxiety.  We will keep an eye upon her for a minute or two and see what\r\nshe is after.  Perhaps it is a messenger from the natives coming off to\r\ntreat with us for the surrender of the wounded.  I hope it may be,\r\nbecause then we shall perhaps learn what has become of the skipper and\r\nthe rest of the missing men.\"\r\n\r\nAs the canoe continued to approach, we observed a certain eccentricity\r\nin her behaviour, for instead of progressing in a straight line her\r\ncourse was a decided _zigzag_, now heading one way and now another, to\r\nthe extent of about four points of the compass; still it looked as\r\nthough she was aiming for the schooner, for her general direction of\r\napproach was toward us.  I procured the night glass and brought it to\r\nbear upon her, and was then able to distinguish that she was indeed an\r\nexceedingly diminutive craft, containing only one figure, who seemed to\r\nbe sitting in her stern, and was paddling somewhat awkwardly, first on\r\none side of her and then on the other, which probably accounted for her\r\neccentricity of movement.  Furthermore, as I continued to watch, a\r\ncertain suggestion of familiarity grew upon me in connection with the\r\nappearance and actions of the paddling figure; and finally, when the\r\ncanoe had approached to within about a hundred fathoms of the schooner,\r\nI put down the glass and hailed:\r\n\r\n\"Canoe ahoy! what canoe is that?\"\r\n\r\n\"Hillo! is that you, Temple?\" came the reply in Cunningham's well-known\r\nvoice.\r\n\r\n\"Ay, ay,\" I replied, \"it is I, right enough.  And glad I am to see that\r\nyou are all right.  Do you happen to know anything about the skipper?\"\r\n\r\n\"Got him here, in the bottom of the canoe,\" was the reply.  \"The poor\r\nold chap is rather badly hurt, I'm afraid.  Con-found this canoe!  Why\r\nwon't the wretched thing go straight?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is because you don't understand how to handle her, I expect,\"\r\nreplied I.  \"Do you know anything about the three men who took you\r\nashore yesterday?\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" answered Cunningham.  \"Didn't they return to the ship?\"\r\n\r\n\"They did not; and I am very much afraid that we shall never set eyes\r\nupon them again.\"\r\n\r\n\"Phew!\" whistled Cunningham; \"that's bad news, although I'm not very\r\ngreatly surprised to hear it after the way that the beggars ashore\r\nbehaved--Hillo! what's this?  Why--I say, Temple, there's a dead native\r\nfloating about out here.  What's the meaning of that?\"\r\n\r\n\"It means that a determined attempt to capture the schooner was made,\r\nabout two hours ago, and was very near being successful,\" said I.  \"Do\r\nyou mean to say that you did not hear the rumpus?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not a sound of it,\" answered Cunningham.  \"But of course that may be\r\naccounted for by--but one can talk about that later.  Just heave me a\r\nrope's end, there's a good chap, and--I say, how are we going to get the\r\nskipper up on deck?  He's rather badly hurt, and can't manage without\r\nassistance, I'm afraid.\"\r\n\r\nThe canoe was by this time close aboard of us, and a few seconds later\r\nshe was brought alongside with the aid of the line which I hove to\r\nCunningham.  Then I dropped lightly over the side into her, to see what\r\ncould be done to help Brown, who all this time had remained perfectly\r\nsilent.  I found him propped up in the eyes of the little craft, and\r\nwhen I stooped over him I saw that his eyes were closed, as though he\r\nslept.  But according to Cunningham it was not sleep, it was\r\ninsensibility, resulting from a blow on the head with a heavy club.  In\r\nany case the poor old fellow was obviously quite unable to help himself.\r\nI therefore took the rope's end which I had thrown to Cunningham, made\r\na standing bowline in the end of it, passed it under the skipper's arms,\r\nand then sang out to those on deck to hoist away gently, while\r\nCunningham and I helped by lifting.  Thus presently we managed to get\r\nBrown first on deck and then down into his own stateroom, where\r\nCunningham, who claimed to possess a certain amateurish skill and\r\nknowledge in medicine and surgery, at once took him in hand, while I\r\nreturned to the deck and assisted the others in the task of\r\nstraightening up generally.\r\n\r\nBy the time we had finished the young dawn was paling the eastern sky,\r\nand the island, from being a mere shapeless black shadow, had changed to\r\na deep neutral-tinted--almost black--silhouette, as clear and sharp of\r\noutline as though it had been cut out of paper, its equally dark\r\nreflection trembling on the surface of the water, and coming and going\r\nalmost as far out as where the schooner lay at anchor.  Then, even as I\r\nstood watching, the pallor brightened to a clear, pale tint of purest\r\nprimrose, which presently flushed into a warm, delicate orange hue; a\r\nlong shaft of white light shot straight up toward the zenith, and an\r\ninstant later the topmast branches of the trees that crowned the island\r\nbecame edged with a thin hair-line of burning gold, which spread with\r\nmarvellous rapidity north and south until every limb and trunk glowed\r\nwith it.  Finally a level beam of golden light flashed through a dense\r\nclump of foliage that crowned the highest point of the island, and the\r\nnext instant that same clump became swallowed up and lost in a great,\r\ndazzling, palpitating blaze of golden light, which was the body of the\r\nrising sun; the colour of the island changed from neutral tint to deep\r\nsepia, and from that to innumerable subtle tones of olive and green, as\r\nthe light grew stronger, and the masses of foliage separated themselves\r\nfrom each other and became distinct, until the shape of each became\r\nperfectly defined and took its proper place in the picture.  And while\r\nthese magical colour changes were in progress the deep shadow which\r\nmarked the junction of land and water dissolved until the beach once\r\nmore emerged into view, with the jollyboat still hauled up on it where\r\nshe had been left on the previous day, and round about her, to left and\r\nright, eight big canoes, undoubtedly those which had been used in the\r\nattack upon the schooner a few hours earlier.\r\n\r\nWhile I still stood gazing, entranced, at the beauty of the new day,\r\nCunningham emerged from the companion way and joined me.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" he said, \"you will be glad to hear that I think we shall pull\r\nthe poor old skipper through, after all.  I started to give him a\r\nthorough overhaul as soon as you left me; and I found that those\r\nmurdering thieves of natives had literally cracked the poor old chap's\r\nskull for him.  I also found that a tiny splinter of bone had been\r\ndriven inward upon the brain by the force of the blow; and this splinter\r\nI succeeded in extracting, with the result that he emerged from his\r\nstate of coma, and, after I had properly dressed his wound, went to\r\nsleep.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TEN.\r\n\r\nWE LOSE THE SKIPPER.\r\n\r\n\"I am delighted to hear it,\" I said, \"for we have paid dearly enough\r\nalready for our folly in coming to this island, without being called\r\nupon to pay the additional penalty of that poor old chap's life.  We\r\nhave lost two of our number in the attack upon the ship, while the three\r\nhands who took you ashore yesterday are missing--and, by the by, where\r\nis Maybury?\"\r\n\r\n\"Dead, poor chap, I am sorry to say--murdered by those treacherous\r\nscoundrels of natives,\" answered Cunningham.  \"The way of it was this.\r\nWhen we landed we were immediately surrounded by a mob of blacks; and\r\njust for a moment I had a shadowy suspicion that things were not quite\r\nall that they ought to be.  But as I looked round I saw that the natives\r\nwere all unarmed; and, moreover, they were all smiling and apparently in\r\nthe best of tempers--indeed, one of them, a girl, flung a garland of\r\nflowers round my neck, either as a joke or a sign of goodwill, I didn't\r\nquite know which--so I took it for granted that they were friendly\r\ndisposed, and we all got laughing and joking together.  Then the\r\nskipper, Maybury, and I gradually worked our way through the crowd, and,\r\naccompanied by the men who had wood to sell, walked up through the\r\nvillage, which seemed to be inhabited chiefly by naked little\r\npiccaninnies, playing in the sand with the dogs, and women.\r\n\r\n\"The village is about a quarter of a mile in length, and beyond it there\r\nare about twenty acres of cleared ground, planted with manioc, cassava,\r\ncorn, and fruit trees--principally bananas, beyond which is the virgin\r\nforest.  Toward this we made our way, and, entering it, followed a bush\r\npath for about a quarter of a mile, until we reached a small open space.\r\nWe had scarcely entered this when the three pretended sandalwood\r\nmerchants simultaneously turned upon us, and, uttering a terrific yell,\r\nseized each of us by the arms, which they tried to confine behind our\r\nbacks.  Taken unawares though I was, I struggled fiercely to throw off\r\nmy particular assailant, but the beggar was a big sinewy chap, with\r\nmuscles like steel, and ere I could wrench myself clear about a dozen\r\nother blacks sprang into the enclosure, evidently in response to the\r\nshout raised by our captors; and before I well knew what was happening I\r\nfound myself upon the ground, with three or four savages sitting upon\r\nme, while others were binding me hand and foot.  While I was still\r\nstruggling I heard the pop of a revolver twice, the reports being so\r\nclose together that I knew at once they must have come from different\r\nweapons; and the next instant I heard a dull crack, a groan, and the\r\nfall of two heavy bodies upon the dry leaves and twigs which carpeted\r\nthe floor of the open space where the struggle had taken place.  Then,\r\nwhen my captors had effectually secured my limbs, they raised me to my\r\nfeet, and I saw the skipper lying, face downward, about a yard away,\r\nwith his head bare, a small stream of blood trickling from it and\r\nclotting among his grey hair; while close to him lay Maybury on his\r\nback, quite dead, with a long spear driven right through his heart.\r\n\r\n\"The blacks turned the skipper over, examined him closely, and then,\r\nfinding that he was not dead, held some sort of consultation in their\r\nown language, the purport of which of course I could not gather; but the\r\nend of it was that they hoisted both of us upon their shoulders, carried\r\nus back to the village, and thrust us into one of the huts, where we lay\r\nuntended for the remainder of the day and practically the whole of last\r\nnight.  Then some time--about the small hours I think it must have\r\nbeen--a girl, who proved to be the same who had flung the garland of\r\nflowers round my neck, stole into the hut as silently as a ghost, laid\r\nher finger upon my lips--to indicate, I suppose, that I was not to\r\ntalk--and deftly proceeded to cast adrift my bonds; after which she\r\nproceeded vigorously to chafe my ankles and wrists, in order to restore\r\nthe circulation, which had been practically suspended by the tightness\r\nwith which the ligatures had been bound.  And look here, Temple, if you\r\nshould ever chance to have an enemy, and have a fancy to torture him,\r\njust bind his wrists and ankles tightly together and leave him for a few\r\nhours--that's all!\r\n\r\n\"Well, when the feeling had come back into my limbs a bit, and I could\r\nmove them without screaming, the girl produced some food and drink, and,\r\nalthough I don't in the least know what they were, I ate and drank\r\nfreely.  Then, in the curious `pidgin' lingo that these people use when\r\nconversing with white men, the girl gave me to understand that my life\r\nand that of the skipper was in the greatest jeopardy, and that if I did\r\nnot want particularly to die I must buck up and save myself and the\r\nskipper.  Then, taking command, she bade me lift the old man by the\r\nshoulders while she took his feet; and in this fashion we slipped out of\r\nthe hut, seeing nobody, and made our way slowly through the wood until\r\nwe emerged upon a little beach just on the other side of that headland.\r\nThen she drew out from among the bushes a small canoe, in the bottom of\r\nwhich she helped me to place the skipper; after which, with a warning to\r\nme to be exceedingly careful and to make no noise, she handed me a\r\npaddle, thrust the canoe afloat, and vanished.  And--and--well, that's\r\nall!  And now you may as well pitch me the yarn of your share of the\r\nnight's doings.  If one may venture to judge by appearances you seem to\r\nhave had a fairly lively time out here.\"\r\n\r\n\"We have, I can assure you,\" said I; and then I proceeded to give\r\nCunningham a detailed account of all that had happened during the\r\nabsence of himself and the skipper.  I had scarcely finished when the\r\ncabin boy came up with the intimation that breakfast was ready in the\r\ncabin, and we accordingly went below, seated ourselves, and fell to.  We\r\ndid not dally long over the meal, for there was still plenty to be done\r\nand thought about; but before returning to the deck I remarked to\r\nCunningham that I should like to look in and see how the skipper was\r\ngetting on, and we both entered the stateroom together.  To my surprise\r\nwe found that the old chap was awake and seemingly feeling not very much\r\nthe worse for the hard knock on the head which he had received; indeed,\r\nhe wanted to turn out and dress and go on deck.  But Cunningham, who had\r\nassumed the role of surgeon, would not hear of such a thing--would not\r\neven permit Brown to leave his bunk; so, as a compromise, I just had to\r\nsit down and spin the whole yarn of our adventure over again to him.\r\nThe poor old fellow seemed very much cut up when he learned that we had\r\nlost six men--all of them compatriots of his, too--and bitterly\r\nreproached himself for having come to the island at all.  Of course we\r\ncomforted him as well as we could by pointing out to him that the\r\nhappening was due not so much to want of precaution on his part as to\r\nthe exceeding guile of the natives; and then I led the conversation\r\nround to the prisoners, and asked what he proposed to do with them.\r\nCunningham was for taking the law into our own hands and inflicting upon\r\nthem a salutary lesson by hanging one of them at the yardarm for each of\r\nour people who had been murdered; but Brown would not hear of this, and\r\nwe were all three still discussing the matter when the cabin boy came\r\ndown with a message from Murdock to say that a large canoe had just been\r\nlaunched from the beach and was heading for the schooner, and would I be\r\npleased to go on deck.\r\n\r\nOf course I instantly obeyed the call, for my first idea was that\r\nanother attack was possibly impending; but when I got on deck I found\r\nthat the canoe, although a large one, was manned by only four natives,\r\nwho were approaching us very slowly, and apparently with a considerable\r\namount of trepidation, and that a large palm-leaf was conspicuously\r\ndisplayed in the bows of the craft, the latter being, as I interpreted\r\nit, intended to serve the purpose of a flag of truce.  Naturally we at\r\nonce assumed our weapons, and saw that our firearms were fully loaded\r\nand placed handy for use, lest further treachery should be contemplated;\r\nand then I hailed the canoe and informed her occupants that if they had\r\nanything to say to us they might approach within easy speaking distance,\r\nbut that they were not to attempt to come alongside without permission,\r\nand that if any such attempt were made they would at once be fired upon.\r\nAnd that there might be no misunderstanding upon this point I\r\nflourished a loaded gun in their sight, to show that we were quite\r\nprepared to carry out our threat.\r\n\r\nSlowly and hesitatingly the canoe continued to approach the schooner\r\nuntil she had arrived within about twenty fathoms of us, and then her\r\ncrew backed water and brought their craft to a standstill.  A short\r\nconsultation among them next followed, and then one of their number rose\r\nto his feet and hailed.\r\n\r\n\"Master,\" he shouted, \"we got it three mans ashore belong you.  You any\r\nmans got it belong we?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" replied I.  \"We have eight of your people on board here.  Are the\r\nwhite men unhurt?\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" was the answer.  \"They all get it hurt leettle bit, not much.\r\nBlack mans along you not hurt, eh?\"\r\n\r\n\"Three of them are unhurt; the others are wounded so they no can walk.\r\nWhat for you not bring it off those white mans with you?\"  I demanded,\r\nadopting their peculiar mode of speech under the mistaken impression\r\nthat I could thus make myself the better understood.\r\n\r\n\"Those white mans no can walk too,\" answered my interlocutor.  \"Suppose\r\nyou want it them, we bring them off, and you give it us those eight\r\nblack fellows belong we, eh?\"\r\n\r\nSo it was an exchange of prisoners that they had come off to negotiate,\r\nit appeared.  Well, I was more than willing to make the exchange, but I\r\ndid not care to appear too eager; so I temporised by enquiring as to the\r\nnature and extent of the white men's hurts.  But they either could not\r\nor would not reply in a manner that was perfectly intelligible to me,\r\nand matters seemed to be approaching a deadlock when one of the canoe\r\nmen started to his feet, and in an eager, impatient manner, asked:\r\n\r\n\"Master, suppose you no got it Oahika aboard, eh?\" which enquiry went a\r\ngood way toward confirming my opinion that the rascal was a person of\r\nsome importance.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" I replied, \"we got it Oahika, all right, not hurt one little\r\nbit.\"  Then, with some vague idea of trying the effect of a \"bluff\", I\r\ncontinued: \"He great blackguard scoundrel!  He attack schooner last\r\nnight, kill it two white mans!  By and by we hang Oahika up there until\r\nhe go dead!\" and I pointed to the schooner's lower yardarm.\r\n\r\nA yell of anguish immediately followed this announcement of mine, fully\r\nconfirming me in the belief that Oahika was likely to prove a valuable\r\nasset if properly manipulated.  The next moment, however, one of the men\r\njumped up and shouted:\r\n\r\n\"Mine no believe you got it Oahika.  Suppose yes, you show it him, eh?\"\r\n\r\n\"Murdock, Simpson,\" I shouted, \"just hoist that swab Oahika up on his\r\nfeet and take him to the rail, so that those fellows in the canoe may\r\nsee him.\"\r\n\r\nThis was done; and the moment that the fellow's head and shoulders\r\nappeared above the top of the schooner's low bulwark another loud howl\r\narose from the crew of the canoe, who incontinently flung themselves\r\ndown on their knees and began to kow-tow energetically.  But they were\r\nquickly interrupted by Oahika, who shouted angrily at them, and then, as\r\nsoon as he had secured their attention, proceeded to gabble to them a\r\nlong string of what seemed to be instructions, in a language quite\r\nunintelligible to me.  When he had finished, the occupants of the canoe\r\nwaved their hands, as if to indicate that they understood, then seized\r\ntheir paddles and began to sweep the canoe's head round toward the\r\nshore.  This sudden change of front rather puzzled me.  I did not quite\r\nknow what to make of it; it might mean anything, I thought, and among\r\nother things it might mean that Oahika had given instructions to muster\r\nevery available fighting man in the village--or the island--and renew\r\nthe attack upon the schooner.  So I hailed the hastily departing canoe:\r\n\r\n\"Hillo, there, canoe ahoy!  Where are you going, and what are you about\r\nto do?\"\r\n\r\nThe men ceased paddling for a moment, and one of them flourished his\r\nhand toward the island.\r\n\r\n\"We get it back along ashore plenty quick and bring it them three mans\r\nbelong you.  Then you give it us Oahika, eh?\" he announced.\r\n\r\n\"You bring the three white mans, and then we'll see,\" I retorted.\r\n\"And--listen you--if you bring any more of your own men with you I shall\r\nshoot Oahika dead!  Sabby?\"\r\n\r\nThis threat, uttered upon the spur of the moment, seemed to disconcert\r\nthem very decidedly, for they remained inactive, staring each other in\r\nthe face.  It also seemed to disconcert Oahika; for no sooner had I\r\nfinished speaking than he began to shout a long string of further\r\ndirections, to which the canoe men replied from time to time by waving\r\ntheir hands.  Finally Oahika brought his communication to an end with a\r\nfew words which, from the intonation of his voice, might have been an\r\ninjunction to the men to hurry up; and away the canoe sped toward the\r\nshore.\r\n\r\nAs soon as it had gone I went down below and reported to the skipper,\r\nwho now seemed to be not quite so well as he had been half an hour\r\nearlier.  He was, naturally, very pleased to learn that the three men\r\nwhom we had all believed to be dead were still alive; and he instructed\r\nme to make the best terms I could for their ransom, and, as soon as I\r\nhad secured possession of them and the boat, to get the schooner under\r\nway and proceed to sea without further delay.\r\n\r\nThe canoe had been gone about three-quarters of an hour when, watching\r\nthe shore through the ship's telescope, I perceived a slight stir upon\r\nthe beach, and presently became aware that a small party of natives had\r\ngathered about the jollyboat, which they pushed off from the beach,\r\nmaking fast her painter to the stern of the canoe.  Then other natives\r\nappeared, bearing in grass hammocks the three missing seamen, who were\r\nlaid in the sternsheets of the jollyboat; and finally the canoe was\r\nmanned, apparently by the same four natives who had previously come off\r\nin her, and headed for the schooner, whereupon I gave orders for the\r\nwindlass to be manned and the cable to be hove short, all ready for\r\ntripping the anchor at a moment's notice.  This was done; and by the\r\ntime the canoe was once more within hailing distance the cable was so\r\ntaut up and down that a single additional revolution of the windlass\r\nbarrel would break out the anchor and free us from the ground.\r\n\r\nAnd now came the really difficult part of my negotiation with the\r\nsavages; for, being themselves superlatively unscrupulous and deceitful,\r\nthey naturally suspected us of being the same, and would not come\r\nalongside, or render up possession of the jollyboat and the three\r\nwounded seamen whom she carried, until we on our part had released\r\nOahika.  And this I flatly refused to do, feeling that, as likely as\r\nnot, they would play us some scurvy trick as soon as they had recovered\r\npossession of the man who, I now very strongly suspected, was the\r\nparamount chief of the island, or, if not that, at least a chief of very\r\nconsiderable importance.  We argued, stipulated, and made counter\r\nstipulations, all to no purpose, and finally once more arrived at a\r\ndeadlock.  Of course I might very easily have settled the matter by\r\nshooting the four natives in the canoe; but that would have been an act\r\nof the very blackest treachery, and I was strongly of opinion that it\r\nwas just such treacherous conduct on the part of certain unscrupulous\r\nwhite men that had made the natives of some of the Polynesian islands\r\nthe cruel, treacherous wretches that they had become.\r\n\r\nI therefore once more resorted to \"bluff\", by hailing them and saying\r\nthat unless they came alongside at once and surrendered possession of\r\nthe boat and those in her, I would get the schooner under way and\r\nproceed to sea, taking Oahika and the rest of our prisoners with me; and\r\nto make my threat the more effective I turned away and gave the order to\r\nman the windlass.  This was enough; with the first clank of the windlass\r\npawls, Oahika, who had thus far taken no part in our second palaver, let\r\nout a yell at the men in the canoe which caused them to surrender\r\ninstantly at discretion and rush their craft up alongside the schooner.\r\n\r\nAnd now I determined upon a bold thing.  These Roua Poua savages had\r\ncaused us a vast amount of trouble and loss; through them we were\r\nshort-handed to the extent of no less than six men; and I felt that for\r\nthe sake of my own satisfaction and self-respect I must get something,\r\nthough it were ever so little, back out of them.  Therefore, since we\r\nwhite men were all armed, and therefore in a position to take good care\r\nof ourselves, as soon as the tackles were hooked into the jollyboat's\r\nringbolts I ordered the four savages in the canoe to leave her and come\r\non deck to help to hoist in the boat; and this they did in a state of\r\nthe most abject fear and trembling.  Then I sent them for'ard to the\r\nwindlass to assist in breaking out the anchor; and it was not until the\r\nschooner was actually adrift that I permitted them to begin the transfer\r\nof their wounded from the _Martha's_ deck to the canoe.  They displayed\r\nremarkably little consideration for the comfort and wellbeing of their\r\ncomrades in the performance of this duty; and indeed I have always been\r\nof opinion that had I been foolish enough to liberate Oahika before the\r\nothers had been transhipped, he and his canoemen would have\r\nincontinently made off at top speed for the shore, leaving the others,\r\nsound and wounded alike, upon our hands and at our mercy.  But I was\r\ncareful to keep Oahika until the last, and it was not until the schooner\r\nwas fairly under way and heading out to sea that I cast him adrift and\r\npermitted him to go over the side, which he did in a splutter of mingled\r\nwrath and fear, pouring out a long string of what were probably native\r\ncurses as he seized the steering paddle and violently thrust the canoe\r\noff the schooner's side.\r\n\r\nBy midday we were bowling merrily away to the westward under every rag\r\nthat we could set, and Roua Poua had sunk out of sight beneath the\r\neastern horizon.  Long before this, however--in fact, the moment that\r\nthey were safely aboard and comfortably bestowed in their bunks--\r\nCunningham had taken the three wounded seamen in hand; and when he had\r\ndone all that he could for them he came up on deck and reported to me.\r\n\r\n\"I am afraid,\" he said, \"that there is not much hope for those three,\"\r\nwith a jerk of his thumb in the direction of the forecastle.  \"Sullivan\r\nand Halpin have had their skulls cracked by blows inflicted with a war\r\nclub, and their cases are very similar to that of the skipper, but\r\nworse; while poor Glenn has no less than eleven spear wounds in his\r\nbody, and though none of them is very serious in itself this heat makes\r\nme terribly afraid of gangrene.  However, I have done all that I can for\r\nthem at present, and we must just hope for the best.  Glenn tells me\r\nthat after the skipper and I had left them the natives came swarming\r\nround them, exciting their curiosity by exhibiting curios of various\r\nkinds for sale, or barter, rather, at ridiculously cheap prices, and so\r\nenticing them away from the beach toward the village, where, they were\r\ninformed, some really valuable articles might be seen.  And then, when\r\nthey arrived at the village, they were suddenly set upon before they had\r\ntime to draw their weapons, overpowered, and confined in a hut, where\r\nthey were left all day yesterday and all last night without food or\r\nwater, and with their injuries untended.  I am afraid there is not much\r\nhope for them, poor fellows!\"\r\n\r\nThis was bad news--so very bad, indeed, that I felt it my duty to go\r\nforthwith to the skipper, report the matter to him, and ask for\r\ninstructions; my own idea being that we ought to head for the Samoa or\r\nTonga group, and procure properly qualified medical assistance with as\r\nlittle delay as possible.\r\n\r\nBut when I got down below and began to talk to the Old Man I soon found\r\nthat he was, for some inscrutable reason, utterly opposed to any such\r\nidea.  He would not give his reasons, but he positively forbade me to do\r\nas I had suggested, instructing me instead to work out a Great Circle\r\ntrack to Canton, and to get the ship upon her proper course at once.\r\nAnd as he seemed to be in full possession of all his faculties, and to\r\nknow quite well what he was talking about, I had no alternative but to\r\nobey.  And indeed, so far as saving the three men in the forecastle was\r\nconcerned, we might as well have been heading for Canton as anywhere\r\nelse; for Halpin and Glenn died within a couple of hours of each other\r\nthat same night, while Sullivan lingered only some twenty-six hours\r\nlonger.\r\n\r\nI looked forward to a speedy and pleasant run to Canton, for I reckoned\r\nupon carrying the Trades with us practically all the way.  But we were\r\nunfortunate; for after a fine run of nine days to the northward and\r\nwestward we ran into the belt of equatorial calms in latitude 4 degrees\r\nSouth, and for fully three weeks thereafter encountered such\r\nextraordinary weather that we dared not ship our fins, from fear of\r\nhaving them carried away, or of badly straining the schooner.  For\r\ninstead of the long spell of calms which one usually expects in those\r\nlatitudes the quiet weather generally lasted but an hour or two, and\r\nthen was succeeded by such furious squalls that, for the most part, we\r\ncould do nothing but run before them under bare poles; and perhaps the\r\nmost exasperating part of it all was that these squalls blew mostly from\r\nthe westward, or nearly dead in our teeth, so that it was only toward\r\nthe tail end of them, just when they were dying out, that we were able\r\nto bring the little hooker to the wind for half an hour or so, and make\r\na few miles of northing.  And when it was not blowing with hurricane\r\nstrength it was usually just the opposite: a flat calm, with a black,\r\nlowering, overcast sky, moist, steamy, overpowering heat, heavy storms\r\nof thunder and lightning, torrential downpours of tepid rain--which, by\r\nthe way, enabled us to re-fill all our water tanks and casks--and\r\nwaterspouts _ad libitum_ constantly threatening us with destruction.\r\n\r\nIt was a month, to a day, from the date of our departure from Roua Poua\r\nwhen we at length cleared the calm belt and got the first breath of the\r\nnorth-east Trades in latitude 3 degrees 47 minutes North, and longitude\r\n158 degrees 55 minutes West, having been driven back almost as far east\r\nas Christmas Island by the baffling winds and furious squalls with which\r\nwe had been obliged to contend; and this brought the dangerous Marshall\r\ngroup right athwart our track.  Therefore, the poor old skipper being\r\nstill unwell, and quite unfit for duty, I decided to make a good stretch\r\nto the northward--say as far as latitude 10 degrees North--before\r\nbearing up for Canton; by doing which I should have a clear sea before\r\nme for the remainder of the trip.\r\n\r\nI have spoken of the skipper as being unwell and quite unfit for duty;\r\nbut that scarcely conveys a correct impression of his condition.  The\r\nfact was that he was well enough to be up and about on deck, but he was\r\nconstantly worried with headache of the most distracting kind, and, what\r\nwas still worse, his intellect seemed to be failing him: he suffered\r\nfrom frequent total lapses of memory, stopping short in the midst of a\r\nconversation simply because he forgot in a moment what he was talking\r\nabout; and he was subject, from time to time, to hallucinations, when he\r\nwould assure us, with the utmost gravity, that he was the King of\r\nEngland taking a holiday \"incognito\", the re-incarnation of Morgan the\r\npirate, or something else equally ridiculous, while at other times he\r\nwould be perfectly rational.  For the first two or three weeks, while\r\nthese symptoms were in process of development, he caused Cunningham and\r\nme a very considerable amount of anxiety, for we were constantly\r\ndreading some new departure which would render him dangerous either to\r\nhimself or to others; but at length, as we were unable to detect any\r\nsuch tendency, we grew easier in our minds, just allowing him to wander\r\nabout the ship at his own sweet will, and amuse himself by giving the\r\nmost extraordinary orders, which nobody ever even pretended to carry\r\nout.  We came to the conclusion that he was suffering from some obscure\r\nform of concussion of the brain, from which we hoped he might be\r\nrelieved upon our arrival at Hong-Kong, where we expected to obtain\r\nefficient surgical assistance; but that, meanwhile, he was in no very\r\nserious danger.  As the event proved, however, we were all woefully\r\nmistaken.  We had made as much northing as I deemed necessary, and were\r\nbowling along upon a west-nor'-west course, reeling off our ten knots\r\nper hour, with all our flying kites abroad and a fine north-east breeze\r\nover our starboard quarter, when, about four bells in the first; watch,\r\nthe skipper came up on deck complaining that he found it impossible to\r\nsleep in consequence of the extreme heat of his cabin.  The night was\r\nbrilliantly starlit, and the air so clear that we could have easily\r\ndistinguished a sail at a distance of two miles, had there been owe to\r\nsee; but the light was not strong enough to enable me clearly to\r\ndistinguish Brown's features, even when he was standing beside me, while\r\nthe cabin lamp was turned low, so that there was not much light coming\r\nthrough the skylight.  But when the old fellow fell into step by my\r\nside, and began to talk quite rationally about the heat below, the\r\nimpossibility of sleeping, and his gratification at the fine breeze\r\nwhich we had fallen in with, and so on, I was completely thrown off my\r\nguard; for he appeared to be in precisely the condition that I had often\r\npreviously seen him in, when he had talked rationally enough for a time,\r\ntaken a little walk--as he was doing at that moment--and then, suddenly\r\nforgetting what he was conversing about, gone below and slept for\r\nseveral hours.\r\n\r\nAll at once, as we were walking to and fro between the main rigging and\r\nthe wheel grating, the old fellow halted, pulled off his cap, extracted\r\na big bandana handkerchief from it, and proceeded to mop his head and\r\nface, from which--as in my own case--the perspiration was freely\r\npouring.\r\n\r\n\"Great snakes,\" he ejaculated, \"but it is hot, and no mistake!  The\r\nsweat's pourin' out o' me like water outen a sponge.  I guess that's\r\nwhat's makin' me so all-fired thirsty.  Where's the water cask?  I'm\r\nboun' to have a drink.  My tongue's so dry it's rattlin' agin my teeth!\r\nCan't ye hear it?  Where's that there scuttle butt, I say?\"\r\n\r\n\"Better not drink direct from the cask, sir,\" I said, for Cunningham had\r\nstrongly urged us all to drink nothing but filtered water, and even that\r\nwith a dash of lime juice in it, during the extreme heat.  \"The filter\r\nstands on the sideboard, and there is an opened bottle of lime juice in\r\nthe rack above it; you will find that very much cooler and more\r\nrefreshing than the water from the scuttle butt.  That stuff is really\r\nnot fit to drink.\"\r\n\r\n\"But I'm so tarnation thirsty that I must have a drink,\" he insisted,\r\n\"and I'd rather drink outer the cask than go below.  Why, man alive,\r\nthat there cabin is like a oven!\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh,\" said I, glancing hastily round and noting that the weather seemed\r\nfine and settled, \"if that is all I'll very soon slip down and fetch you\r\nup a drink!  Bring yourself to an anchor here on the wheel grating, sir,\r\nwhile I go below.  I'll be back in a brace of shakes.  Just keep your\r\neye on him, Chips,\" I whispered to the carpenter, who was at the wheel.\r\n\"I'll not be gone more than half a minute.\"\r\n\r\n\"Right you are, sir,\" responded the carpenter, turning his quid in his\r\nmouth as the skipper obediently seated himself on the wheel grating,\r\nwhile I made a rush for the companion.  I turned up the cabin lamp,\r\nprocured a tumbler, and was in the act of measuring out a liberal dose\r\nof lime juice when I heard the carpenter's voice suddenly upraised in\r\naccents of panic.\r\n\r\n\"Man overboard!  Man overboard!!\" he shouted.  \"Mr Temple, come on\r\ndeck, sir; the skipper's been and throwed hisself over the lee rail!\"\r\n\r\nFlinging down the tumbler and bottle of lime juice, I mounted the\r\ncompanion ladder in two jumps, nearly dashing my brains out against the\r\nslide in my haste, and stared stupidly about me for a moment, being more\r\nthan half-stunned.  Then, as I pulled myself together, I heard Chips\r\nrepeating, parrot-wise:\r\n\r\n\"He just laid his han's upon the rail and swung hisself clean overboard,\r\nlike a boy jumpin' a gate.\"\r\n\r\n\"Down helm, man; down helm and round her to!\"  I roared.  And rushing to\r\nthe main rigging I let go the lee braces and began to drag frantically\r\nupon the weather ones in an ineffectual effort to back the topsail.\r\nThen I remembered that the weather studdingsails were set, being\r\nreminded thereof, in fact, by the snapping of the topmast\r\nstuddingsail-boom, as the schooner, with her helm hard a-lee, rushed\r\nfuriously up into the wind, and her topgallantsail, topsail, and\r\nsquaresail flew aback, and the broken spar began to thresh spitefully\r\nagainst the fore rigging in the fresh breeze.  I saw at once that I had\r\nmade a mess of things to no purpose, and also stood to make a far worse\r\nmess of them if I was not careful; for the amount of sail which the\r\nschooner could carry while running off the wind was altogether too much\r\nfor her when brought to, and she was now lying over with her lee rail\r\nburied, with the possibility that her masts might go over the side at\r\nany moment if she were not relieved in one way or another.  As for\r\nsaving the skipper, that was impossible: for--as I had forgotten for the\r\nmoment--we were now, owing to the loss of six of our foremast men,\r\nshort-handed, and we could not possibly launch a boat until the schooner\r\nwas snugged down; and by the time we had done that we should be miles\r\naway from the spot where the skipper had gone overboard, without any\r\ncertain, definite knowledge as to the precise direction in which to look\r\nfor him.  Therefore, all these circumstances coming to my mind in a\r\nflash, I jumped to the wheel and helped Chips to put it hard up again,\r\nluckily managing to get the little hooker before the wind once more with\r\nno further damage than the loss of a studdingsail-boom and the splitting\r\nof the lower studdingsail.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER ELEVEN.\r\n\r\nTHE WRECK OF THE \"MARTHA BROWN\".\r\n\r\nThis last fatality had the rather curious result that of the entire crew\r\nwho left Baltimore in the _Martha Brown_ only the cook and the cabin boy\r\nnow survived, the remainder of the existing crew consisting of\r\nCunningham, myself, and the boatswain, carpenter, and sailmaker of the\r\n_Zenobia_; it also resulted in the destinies of the ship and those\r\naboard her, and the interests of poor old Ephraim Brown's widow,\r\nsuddenly falling into my inexperienced hands.  This being the case, I\r\ndecided to consult with Cunningham at once as to the proper steps to be\r\ntaken under the circumstances, although my own view of the matter was\r\nperfectly clear and decided.  And that view, stated briefly, amounted to\r\nthis: that my obvious duty was to do the very best I possibly could for\r\nMrs Brown, and that, knowing quite clearly what the skipper's\r\nintentions were, I could not do better than carry them out in their\r\nentirety.  It was in this form that I laid the matter before Cunningham,\r\nasking him to give me his opinion upon it, and requesting him to suggest\r\na better course if he could think of one; but he fully agreed with me\r\nthat, the schooner being practically full of sandalwood, and being also\r\nwithin three weeks' sail of Canton, we could not do better than proceed\r\nto our destination, dispose of our cargo, invest the proceeds in tea,\r\nand then be guided by circumstances--or, rather, the state of the\r\nmarket--as to whether we should take the tea to Europe or America,\r\nultimately returning to Baltimore, and there rendering an account of our\r\nstewardship.  And upon this understanding being arrived at, the voyage\r\nto Canton was continued.\r\n\r\nIt was on the afternoon of the third day following the suicide of the\r\nskipper that the Trade wind, which up to then had been blowing with its\r\nusual steadiness, began to weaken, and upon consulting the barometer I\r\nfound that the mercury was falling rather rapidly.  At the same time I\r\nbecame aware that the aspect of the firmament was undergoing a subtle\r\nchange, the clear, brilliant blue of the sky gradually fading to a\r\ncolourless pallor, as though a succession of veils of white gauze was\r\nbeing drawn across it, while the clouds, sailing up out of the\r\nnorth-east, paused in their flight and began to bank up in the\r\nsouth-west quarter.  These changes continued throughout the afternoon,\r\nthe result being that the sun gradually became blotted out, and was\r\nentirely obscured about an hour and a half before the time of sunset.\r\nAnd with the disappearance of the sun the wind sank until it died away\r\naltogether and the schooner lost steerage way, while the heavens assumed\r\na dark, lowering appearance, and the atmosphere became close,\r\nsuffocating, and so oppressively hot that even the thinnest and lightest\r\nof clothing was an almost unendurable burden, and every article was\r\ndispensed with that could be discarded without outraging decency.  But\r\nalthough the wind had completely died away, the swell did not diminish;\r\non the contrary, it seemed if anything to increase, for the schooner\r\nrolled and plunged most outrageously, shipping water over her rails, her\r\nbows, and even her taffrail, the water seeming to heap itself up\r\nsuddenly and fall aboard her in the most extraordinary and unexpected\r\nmanner.  It was evident that a change of weather was impending, and, as\r\nthe mercury clearly indicated that the change would be for the worse, I\r\ncaused the schooner to be stripped just before darkness set in, leaving\r\nonly the reefed foresail and fore staysail set, under which short canvas\r\nI believed she could not come to much harm, let the impending weather be\r\nwhat it might.\r\n\r\nA quarter of an hour after the time of sunset the darkness was so\r\nintense that for all practical purposes we might as well have been\r\nblind, for at a distance of ten or twelve feet from the illuminated\r\ncabin skylight it was literally impossible to see one's hand when held\r\nclose before one's eyes; while between the darkness and the violently\r\nuneasy motions of the little hooker it was positively dangerous to\r\nattempt to move about the decks.  As for staying below, it was out of\r\nthe question, for the cabins were like so many ovens; therefore, after\r\nsupper was over, Cunningham and I both returned to the deck, and,\r\nseating ourselves on the wheel grating beside the lashed wheel, chatted\r\ntogether while the engineer smoked pipe after pipe.\r\n\r\nIt happened to be my eight hours in, that night; therefore, since it was\r\nhopeless to think of sleeping in my bunk on such a hot, breathless\r\nnight, I stretched myself out on the wheel grating, shortly after eight\r\nbells of the second dog-watch, and was soon fast asleep, despite the\r\nhardness of my bed, while Cunningham sat near me, keeping such a lookout\r\nas was possible under the circumstances.\r\n\r\nIt was seven bells, or within half an hour of midnight, when Cunningham\r\nawoke me.\r\n\r\n\"Sorry to disturb you before your time, old chap,\" he apologised.  \"I\r\nhave been hoping that it might not be necessary to awake you until eight\r\nbells, but--just look at that sky!  What on earth does it mean; and what\r\nis going to happen?\"\r\n\r\nI had started up, broad awake, the instant that Cunningham's hand\r\ntouched my shoulder, and had at once become conscious of the very\r\nextraordinary and portentous aspect of the sky; it was therefore quite\r\nunnecessary for me to ask what he meant.  When, soon after the\r\nexpiration of the second dog-watch, I had stretched myself out and\r\nfallen asleep on the wheel grating, the darkness had been as opaque as\r\nthat of Egypt when Moses stretched forth his hand and there was a thick\r\ndarkness in all the land for the space of three days, during which the\r\nEgyptians saw not one another, neither rose any from his place; but now,\r\nthe moment that I opened my eyes, I saw that the plunging schooner, the\r\nrestless, heaving surface of the ocean, and the overarching dome of the\r\nsky, packed with enormous masses of slowly working cloud, were all\r\nsuffused with ruddy light, such as might be emitted by a volcano in\r\nfurious eruption.  Yet no flaming crater was anywhere visible, nor did\r\nthe light flicker or wax and wane, as it would have done had it issued\r\nfrom such a source; it was perfectly steady, and after I had gazed upon\r\nit for a time I could come to no other conclusion than that it emanated\r\nfrom the clouds themselves, which glowed with the colour of iron heated\r\nto a low red-heat.  I had never before beheld such a weird,\r\nawe-inspiring spectacle, but as I gazed upon it the memory came to me\r\nthat I had somewhere read of something similar, and I also remembered\r\nthat it had been described as the precursor of a hurricane, or some\r\nsimilar atmospheric convulsion.\r\n\r\n\"I am afraid it means a heavy blow, a hurricane--or typhoon as they call\r\nit in these seas,\" said I: \"and I am very glad that you called me, for I\r\nwill take the hint and have the schooner battened down forthwith; also\r\nthis is the first time I have ever witnessed such a phenomenon, and I\r\nwould not have missed it on any account.  You might as well turn in now,\r\nif you care to do so,\" I added, \"for I see it is not far off eight\r\nbells, and I shall not attempt to sleep again.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thanks, no--not if I know it!\" answered Cunningham.  \"Like yourself, I\r\nhave never seen anything of this kind before, and I intend to see all\r\nthat I can of it now that I have the opportunity.  It began more than\r\nhalf an hour ago, the ruddy glare growing out of the inky blackness so\r\nsubtly and imperceptibly that it is difficult to say precisely when it\r\nbegan, but I became conscious of it when I got up to strike six bells.\r\nThen it brightened so rapidly, and seemed so altogether unnatural, that\r\nat length I began to feel jumpy about it, and decided that the time had\r\narrived when you ought to be called.\"\r\n\r\n\"Quite right,\" I agreed.  \"Well, if you won't turn in, perhaps you will\r\nbe good enough to keep a lookout here while I go for'ard and see to the\r\nbattening down.  There is not much to be done, but the little that needs\r\ndoing might as well be done at once.\"  And therewith I left him and\r\nstaggered along the squirming deck to the forecastle head, where Chips\r\nand Sails were perched upon the windlass bitts, out of the way of the\r\nwater that was constantly slopping in over one bow or the other, talking\r\ntogether in a low-pitched murmur, and staring awestruck at the\r\nincandescent sky.\r\n\r\n\"Well, Chips,\" said I, \"have you ever seen anything like this before?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ay, sir, I seen the same thing once before, when I was in the\r\n_Tenedos_, one of the China tea clippers,\" answered the carpenter.  \"We\r\nwas in the Injin Hocean at the time, homeward-bound.  The skipper--Cap'n\r\nBowers, his name was--was down with dysentery at the time, and the mate\r\nwas one o' these here chaps that thinks they knows everything.  He\r\n'lowed that the weather signs didn't mean nothin' partic'lar, and\r\nwouldn't so much as take in the skysails--because, d'ye see, we was\r\nracin' home with another ship, and Mister Mate reckoned he wasn't goin'\r\nto be scared into shortenin' down just because the weather looked a bit\r\nunusual.  Consequence was that we was on our beam-ends about a hour\r\na'terwards, with all three masts over the side and the ship threatenin'\r\nto go down under us.  A nice busy twenty-four hours we had of it a'ter\r\nthat, I can tell ye, Mr Temple, and it ended up in our crawlin' into\r\nTable Bay under jury-masts, and lyin' there five solid months before the\r\nnew spars comed out to us and we re-rigged the old barkie!\"\r\n\r\n\"How did it come down upon you then--in the shape of a sudden squall?\"\r\nI demanded.\r\n\r\n\"Well, no, not exactly that,\" answered the carpenter.  \"It began wi'\r\nlittle whifflin' gusts that comed up from nowhere partic'lar, and was\r\ngone again afore you could say Jack Robinson.  They comed moanin' along,\r\nfilled the canvas with a smack, and--there was an end o' that one.  Then\r\nanother'd come along same way, do the same thing, and go floatin' away\r\ndown to loo'ard.  It happened 'bout half a dozen times, and then, afore\r\nwe knowed where we was, away come the hurricane, screamin' and yellin'\r\nlike Billy-oh.  `Halyards and sheets let go, fore an' aft!' yells my\r\nnoble Mr Mate--Bryce his name was; but, Lor' bless you, sir, afore we\r\ncould cast off the turns from the belayin' pins the gale had hit us, and\r\nthere we was, on our beam-ends, wi! the deck standin' up like the side\r\nof a 'ouse.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said I, \"that can scarcely happen to us, I think, with the small\r\nspread of canvas that we are showing.  But it will be bad enough when it\r\ncomes, I doubt not; so go below and call Murdock, the cook, and the\r\ncabin boy, and say I want them to come on deck, as I am about to batten\r\ndown the fore scuttle.  And when eight bells comes, you will have to go\r\naft and stretch yourselves out on the cabin lockers, for the forecastle\r\nwill be closed until this breeze is over.\"\r\n\r\nIt took us but a few minutes to batten down the forecastle hatch\r\nsecurely, for there was a good tarpaulin cover that had been specially\r\nmade to fit it; and when that was done I set our scanty crew to work--\r\nmyself lending a hand--to secure the galley and the boats with extra\r\nlashings, so that they might not be washed away: and when we had\r\nfinished, the cook entered his galley and shut himself in, to finish the\r\nnight there.\r\n\r\nAs it happened, we were none too soon in the completion of our\r\npreparations; for scarcely had we finished when the ruddy glow in the\r\nsky began to die out again, and as it did so the first of those\r\nscuffling puffs of which Chips had spoken came whining and moaning\r\nacross the surface of the ocean from the south-west, filling our scanty\r\nspread of canvas with a resounding clap and then passing away toward the\r\nnorth-east, its track across the glistening surface of the ocean being\r\nmarked by a dimming blur like a catspaw, which swept down toward us,\r\ntouched us for an instant, and was gone again.  This occurred some seven\r\nor eight times at decreasing intervals, each succeeding rush of air\r\nbeing of a few seconds' longer duration than the preceding one, and\r\ncoming with greater strength and spite, thus enabling us at last to get\r\nsteerage way upon the schooner and partially turn her stern toward the\r\npoint from which we expected the outfly to come.  And when presently it\r\ncame roaring and howling and screaming down upon us, with such a medley\r\nof sound as might be expected from a legion of unchained furies, our\r\nport quarter was turned towards it, with the schooner in motion and\r\npaying off before it.  Yet, even so, it swooped down upon us with such\r\nappalling violence that the little vessel careened until her lee\r\nsheer-poles were buried and the water was up to the coaming of the main\r\nhatch.  But with way on her, her helm hard up, no after canvas set, and\r\nthe hurricane dragging at her stout foresail, she could not help paying\r\noff, and after a long minute of heart-racking suspense, during which we\r\nmomentarily expected her to keel-up with us, she suddenly righted and\r\nwent flying away dead before the wind, with the water boiling under her\r\nbows up to the level of her head-boards.\r\n\r\nOne of the _Martha Brown's_ good points was that she steered as handily\r\nas a little boat.  I therefore had no difficulty in keeping her dead\r\nbefore the wind without assistance, although Cunningham stood by to lend\r\nme a hand should I chance to need any help.  Also the water, apart from\r\nthe boiling foam into which its surface was scourged by the hurricane,\r\nwas perfectly smooth, the smallest suggestion of a wave crest being\r\ninstantly seized by the wind and swept away to leeward in the form of\r\nfine, salt rain; indeed, the air was so full of spindrift and scudwater\r\nthat I believed, even had it been daylight, we could not have seen\r\nfarther than about two, or at most three, lengths from the ship.  As it\r\nwas, with the outfly of the hurricane that weird, unnatural, ruddy light\r\nof which I have spoken almost immediately died out from the sky, leaving\r\nthe night as pitch-dark as before, save for the ghostly gleam of\r\nphosphorescent light which arose from the storm-swept ocean, and which\r\ngave the water, as far as it could be seen, the appearance as if\r\nmoonlight were shining up through it.\r\n\r\nWhen we had been scudding for a full quarter of an hour before that\r\nraving, screaming, howling fury of wind I began momentarily to expect\r\nand look for some indication that the worst was over, and to hope that\r\nthe wind would moderate sufficiently to allow us to heave the schooner\r\nto before the sea should acquire height and weight enough to render the\r\noperation dangerous, for now every mile that we ran was carrying us just\r\nso much farther from our destination.  But as time went on the gale,\r\ninstead of moderating, seemed to increase in strength, until I began to\r\nwonder how much longer hemp and pine and canvas could endure the\r\nterrific strain to which our foremast, its rigging, and the reefed\r\nforesail were exposed.  Still, although the mast was bowed forward in a\r\ncurve that seemed to have approached perilously near to breaking-point,\r\nand although the shrouds and backstays were strained until they were\r\nhard as iron bars, everything was, so far, holding splendidly, and the\r\nschooner was rushing along at a speed which I was firmly persuaded she\r\nhad never before approached.\r\n\r\nAt length, after I had been at the wheel nearly three hours, Cunningham\r\ninsisted on relieving me: and, to speak truth, I was more than glad to\r\naccept his offer, for notwithstanding that it was by that time blowing\r\nharder than ever, and that the wind continued to scoop up the water in\r\nsuch vast quantities that the air was thick with salt rain, a high and\r\nunpleasantly steep sea had gradually risen, chasing the schooner and\r\nconstantly threatening to poop her, or broach her to, so that at length,\r\nin order to escape the one fate or the other, it became necessary to\r\nkeep the wheel perpetually in motion, now to port and anon to starboard;\r\nand a couple of hours of that kind of work, combined with the heavy\r\nstrain upon one's nerves, is enough pretty well to tire out the\r\nstrongest--moreover, I was drenched to the skin.  Therefore I gladly\r\nmade way for Cunningham, and, having first gone forward and directed\r\nMurdock to go aft and stand by the wheel, so that he might be at hand in\r\nthe event of Cunningham needing any assistance, I returned aft--finding\r\nit necessary, by the way, to go down on my hands and knees and literally\r\ncrawl along the deck, in order to make headway against the buffeting of\r\nthe wind--and went below to my cabin, where I proceeded to strip off my\r\nwet clothes and subject myself to a vigorous towelling preparatory to\r\ndonning a dry rig and my mackintosh.\r\n\r\nTaking my time over the operation, I had proceeded so far as to have\r\ndonned a dry undervest and a pair of thin duck trousers; and, having\r\nrolled the legs of these up to my knees, was in the act of unhooking my\r\nlong mackintosh coat from its peg, when a terrific shock hurled me\r\nviolently against the cabin bulkhead, and the next instant a deafening\r\nmedley of sounds, compounded chiefly of the crash of breaking spars, the\r\nwild yells of Cunningham and Murdock, the seething smash of a perfect\r\nmountain of water on the deck, the splintering of the glass in the cabin\r\nskylight and the pouring of a deluge of water down into the cabin, smote\r\nupon my ears.\r\n\r\nPartially stunned by the violence with which I had been dashed against\r\nthe bulkhead, I made no immediate effort to rise, but remained passively\r\nwhere I had fallen, stupidly striving to realise what had happened,\r\nuntil a tremendous upheaval of the schooner's hull, by which she was\r\nhove completely over on her beam-ends, and a rush of water that\r\nhalf-filled my cabin awoke me to the consciousness that a catastrophe of\r\nsome sort had overtaken us, and I scrambled awkwardly and with\r\ndifficulty to my feet, pulling myself up by means of the knobs of the\r\ndrawers under my standing bedplace, when another furious shock again\r\nupset me, and I fell squatting into the water violently surging to and\r\nfro athwart my cabin.  By this time, however, full consciousness of the\r\nserious character of the situation had come to me, and as the schooner\r\nwas again hove up and almost on to her opposite beam-ends, I let go my\r\nhold of the drawer-knobs and went swirling out through my stateroom\r\ndoor, lifted fairly off my feet by the rush of water, and found myself\r\nswimming for my life in the main cabin, in the midst of a squadron of\r\ncushions that had floated or been flung off the top of the cabin\r\nlockers.  Then another mountainous sea swooped down upon and overwhelmed\r\nthe hapless schooner, another deluge poured into her cabin through the\r\nsmashed skylight and the companion, and had not a backwash of water just\r\nthen swept me into the companion way and stranded me on the ladder, so\r\nthat I could grasp the handrail, I should certainly have been drowned,\r\nfor that second downpour filled the cabin to the level of the beams.\r\n\r\nAs I pulled myself up and secured a footing on the companion ladder I\r\nfelt the hull of schooner again soaring aloft, up, up, until it seemed\r\nto my excited imagination as though the little craft was being hove\r\nright up among the clouds and at the same time being capsized.  Then\r\ncame the thundering crash of another mountain of water upon her deck,\r\naccompanied by the sound of rending woodwork as the companion cover\r\nparted company and was swept away; a whole Niagara of water poured down\r\nthrough the opening upon my devoted head, and as I clung to the handrail\r\nwith the grip of a drowning man the schooner struck a third time, with\r\nsuch terrific violence that I fully expected the hull to go to pieces\r\nabout my ears.  But no, the stanchly built little hooker still held\r\ntogether, although I knew that her bottom must be stove in like a\r\ncracked egg-shell; and presently, when I felt that I could not hold my\r\nbreath for another second, I found my head once more above water, and\r\nsaw dimly, close above me, the hole in the deck where the companion\r\ncover had once been.  Another moment and I had again found footing on\r\nthe ladder, and, bruised all over and aching in every joint of my body,\r\nI crawled out on deck.\r\n\r\nWhether it was that my eyes had at last adjusted themselves to the\r\ndarkness, or that the darkness was less profound than it had been, I\r\nknow not, but as I emerged from the companion way and secured a footing\r\non deck I became aware that I could dimly perceive my immediate\r\nsurroundings.  The first object to catch my eye was the stump of the\r\nmainmast within a few feet of the spot where I was standing, and the\r\ninstinct of self-preservation at once prompted me to make a dash at it\r\nand fling my arms round it, in order that I might not be swept away by\r\nthe next sea which should break aboard.  And as I stood there gasping\r\nfor breath and staring about me I discovered that I could not only dimly\r\nperceive my immediate surroundings, but that the entire hull of the\r\nschooner was visible as an all but shapeless black patch in the midst of\r\na madly leaping chaos of swirling foam, which gleamed ghostly white in\r\nthe light of its own phosphorescence.  It was still blowing as furiously\r\nas ever, and the air was thick with spindrift and scudwater, which\r\nblotted out everything outside the radius of some thirty fathoms on\r\nevery side; but the schooner now seemed to be in comparatively smooth\r\nwater, and I was not long in guessing at the reason, for, glancing to\r\nwindward, I could dimly see, a few fathoms away, a great wall of\r\nspouting, leaping white breakers, evidently marking the position of the\r\nreef upon which we had struck so violently, and over which we now seemed\r\nto have beaten, for there were no further shocks.  But imperfectly as I\r\ncould distinguish objects in the darkness, I could still see enough to\r\nconvince me that the schooner was a complete wreck and full of water,\r\nfor both masts were over the starboard side, still attached to the hull\r\nby the rigging, while every scrap of bulwark, boats, galley, in fact\r\neverything above the level of the deck, was swept away.\r\n\r\nA single glance sufficed me to grasp these details, and then I turned my\r\ngaze inboard again, wondering whether any of the others had survived\r\nthat awful passage across the reef.  And as I did so the sound of\r\nsomeone vomiting close at hand reached my ears.\r\n\r\n\"Who is that?\"  I demanded, looking in the direction from which the\r\nsound proceeded, and as I spoke a figure uphove itself from among the\r\nraffle of the port main rigging, which lay athwart the deck, and a voice\r\nwhich I recognised as Cunningham's responded.\r\n\r\n\"That you, Temple?\" it asked.  \"Ugh!  Ouch!  Ow!  By the Piper, this is\r\nawful!  I seem to have swallowed half the Pacific Ocean!  Ow!  Ugh!  I--\r\nAw!  I say, old chap--auch!--where the dickens are we, and what has\r\nhappened, eh?\"\r\n\r\n\"Where we are I'll be hanged if I know,\" I responded, \"for all about\r\nhere should be open water, according to the chart.  But it isn't, for\r\nwe've just beaten over a reef and in all probability smashed the bottom\r\nof the poor little hooker to matchwood in the process.  And now the best\r\nwe can hope is that there is land of some sort close under our lee, for\r\nif there isn't we are in a very pretty pickle.  Have you seen anything\r\nof the others?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" answered Cunningham, \"Murdock is here; but I'm afraid he is badly\r\nhurt, poor chap, if not killed outright.  When the schooner struck, he\r\nand I were swept for'ard by the first sea that broke aboard, and the\r\nnext thing I knew, when the water had gone, was that I was clinging to\r\nthis rigging here with one hand, and that I had hold of somebody's leg\r\nwith the other, that somebody being Murdock.  But he was--and still is--\r\ninsensible, and I am afraid he must have been violently dashed against\r\nsome of the wreckage, so I lost no time in making him fast to the first\r\nloose rope's end I could find.  But I say, if the schooner's bottom is\r\nstove, as you say, I suppose she'll sink in a few minutes, won't she?\"\r\n\r\n\"Sink!  With her hold full of sandalwood?  Not much!\"  I retorted.\r\n\"Still, I hope there is land not far away, for I have no fancy for\r\nwashing about the Pacific on a crazy, waterlogged hulk, and that is the\r\ncondition of the _Martha Brown_ at this moment.  But where are Chips and\r\nSails and the boy?  I'm afraid we shall never again set eyes upon poor\r\ncooky, for he was in the galley, and that, I see, is gone, together with\r\neverything else that was on deck.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said Cunningham, \"it went, I think, with the first sea that broke\r\naboard us when we struck the reef.  And I don't know what has become of\r\nthe others.  I seem to remember having seen two figures emerge from the\r\ncompanion way while I was busy with Murdock here, but I don't know what\r\nbecame of them.  I wonder whether we could do anything for the\r\nboatswain--the sea is no longer breaking aboard, and--\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, of course,\" said I.  \"Where is he?  We can at least discover\r\nwhether or not he is alive.\"\r\n\r\n\"Here he is, among all this raffle,\" answered Cunningham.  \"The first\r\nthing, I suppose, will be to get him clear of it, and then--\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I am afraid that is about all that we can do for him at present,\"\r\nsaid I, as I moved across the sluggishly rolling deck toward Cunningham.\r\nI stooped beside him, and at his direction lifted the tangle of rigging\r\nbeneath which the boatswain was lying, while he proceeded to cast off\r\nthe lashings that had saved the inert body from being washed overboard.\r\nThen between us we dragged the man out to a clear spot on the deck,\r\nwhere Cunningham knelt, supporting the head and shoulders, while I tore\r\nopen the front of the thin vest and laid my hand upon the broad, hairy\r\nchest.  The heart was beating, although but feebly; yet as Cunningham\r\ncontinued to support the man in a sitting position the beats gradually\r\nbecame stronger, and presently, with a groan, consciousness returned,\r\nand, heaving himself over on his side, with an ejaculation, poor Murdock\r\nbegan to vomit violently, as Cunningham had done, having evidently, like\r\nhim, swallowed a great quantity of salt water.  For perhaps five minutes\r\nthe paroxysm continued with severity; then, having rid himself of most\r\nof the salt water, the man, between groans, began to ask where he was,\r\nand then, as memory returned, informed us that he had received a violent\r\nblow on the top of the head which had knocked the senses out of him.\r\nFortunately there was no wound; and after a while the boatswain was able\r\nto sit up unassisted, with his back against the stump of the mainmast.\r\nAnd then, having placed him in a tolerably comfortable position, we were\r\nfree again to take cognisance of things in general, when we became aware\r\nof the fact that the schooner, although still rolling heavily with the\r\nmovement of the water about her, had taken the ground; and upon looking\r\naway to leeward I thought I could perceive, through the flying spindrift\r\nand against the darkness of the sky, a darker shadow which could\r\nscarcely be anything else than land.\r\n\r\nWhen next we turned to Murdock, to enquire whether there was anything\r\nmore that we could do for him, we found that he had fallen asleep, which\r\nwas perhaps the best thing that could have happened to him.  We\r\ntherefore left him to finish his nap and fell to pacing the weather side\r\nof the deck, between the main rigging and the taffrail, comparing notes\r\nas to our experiences; and while we were still thus engaged we became\r\naware of two things.  The first of these was that the gale was breaking,\r\nwhile the second was that the dawn was at hand, for far away to leeward\r\nof us the sky was paling, down to a certain point, beneath which the\r\nshadow lay as dark as ever, but was assuming, even as we stood, a\r\ncertain definiteness of shape, ultimately resolving itself into the\r\noutline of what seemed a distant hill, with deeper shadows between\r\nourselves and it, which, in turn, developed into a low, bush-crowned\r\ncliff, out of the base of which a sandy beach presently grew as the\r\nlight gathered strength.\r\n\r\nThen, quite suddenly, the clouds to windward and overhead broke up into\r\ndetached masses, between which a few stars twinkled transiently before\r\nthey vanished in the fast-growing light of the new day; and the cloud\r\nmasses drove away to leeward and disappeared, revealing a sky of the\r\ndeepest, richest ultramarine, softening away down in the eastern quarter\r\nto a tone of the palest and most delicate primrose, against which the\r\noutline of the distant hill stood out, sharp as though cut out of paper,\r\nso deeply purple as to be almost black.  Then, the light coming so\r\nswiftly that the eye scarcely found time to note the multitudinous\r\nchanges of tint accompanying it, the sky behind the hill flushed from\r\npalest primrose to rich, glowing amber; a few evanescent shreds of cloud\r\nmidway between horizon and zenith blushed rosy red at being caught\r\nunawares by the sun's first rays, then vanished; a pencil dipped in\r\nburning gold outlined the crest of the distant hill for a few seconds,\r\nand then the upper edge of the sun's disk, palpitating with living\r\nlight, floated up into view beyond the ridge of the hill, and in an\r\ninstant the whole scene, save the beach, which still lay in the shadow\r\nof the cliff, became a picture of brilliant, dazzling light and colour.\r\nTo seaward, about two miles distant, was the creaming surf, sparkling\r\ndiamond-like as it plunged down upon the reef over which we had driven\r\nand then leaped and spouted thirty feet high into the clear air before\r\nthe wind caught it and tore it into mist; while shoreward there\r\nstretched a line of curving sandy beach, about a mile in length, forming\r\npart of the shore of a shallow bay into which we had driven and wherein\r\nthe schooner now lay stranded.  The beach was distant about half a\r\ncable's length from us, and was backed by a rocky cliff averaging about\r\nfifty feet in height, crowned by a growth of low scrub, over the top of\r\nwhich appeared what now seemed to be a low, flat-topped hill, distant\r\nperhaps three miles inland.\r\n\r\nThe beach immediately to leeward of the schooner was strewed with\r\nfragments of wreckage, among which we recognised the galley and some\r\nfragments of the boats; but what gave us the greatest satisfaction of\r\nall was to see two apparently inanimate figures--those of the carpenter\r\nand the sailmaker--rise slowly to their feet, walk down to the water's\r\nedge, stare intently in our direction under the sharp of their hands,\r\nand then wave their hands frantically in response to our waving, as they\r\nrecognised the fact that we were aboard the wreck, and for the present,\r\nat all events, safe.  Then they put their hands trumpet-wise to their\r\nmouths and evidently hailed us; but the roar and the crash of the surf\r\non the reef were so deafening that it was impossible for us to catch a\r\nword of what they said, and, recognising this, they presently turned and\r\nwalked up the sand until they came to a dry spot, where they sat down,\r\nwith the obvious intention of awaiting events.  As for Cunningham and\r\nmyself, we could do nothing but abide in patience where we were until\r\nthe surf upon the beach should moderate sufficiently to render it safe\r\nfor us to swim ashore, the wreck being swept so clean that, without\r\nbreaking up the deck, there was not a fragment of timber left out of\r\nwhich to construct a raft.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TWELVE.\r\n\r\nTHE ISLAND.\r\n\r\nBy the time the sun had been risen about an hour, Cunningham and I\r\nbecame aware that it needed something more than a mere shipwreck to rob\r\nus of our appetite, for we found ourselves rapidly developing a good,\r\nwholesome hunger; but, alas! there were no means of appeasing it, for\r\nthe schooner was full of water and everything in the nature of\r\nprovisions was quite un-get-at-able: we should therefore be obliged to\r\nwait for a meal until we could get ashore, which, we decided, could\r\nscarcely be until the afternoon, if even then.  And we soon came to the\r\nconclusion that our companions ashore were in like case with ourselves,\r\nso far at least as hunger was concerned, for about half an hour later we\r\nsaw them rise to their feet, point first to their mouths and then to the\r\ntop of the cliff, and presently proceed to the cliff foot, evidently in\r\nsearch of a spot at which it might be climbed.  And although, viewed\r\nfrom the wreck, the cliff appeared to be quite vertical, they soon found\r\nsuch a spot; for, as we watched, they began to ascend the cliff,\r\nzigzagging to right and left and apparently following something that by\r\ncourtesy might be called a path, for they walked rather than climbed it,\r\nreaching the top in about five minutes.  Then, with a wave of the hand\r\nto us, they turned into the bushes and disappeared, returning about an\r\nhour afterwards with what, as they held it up for us to see, looked like\r\na small bunch of bananas.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the gale having broken, the wind rapidly dropped, until about\r\nmidday it fell stark calm.  But it was not until nearly sunset that the\r\nsurf on the beach had abated sufficiently to render it at all safe for\r\nus to attempt the swim from the wreck to the shore, by which time we\r\nwere both so ravenously hungry that we were prepared to take quite an\r\nappreciable amount of risk, if by doing so we could procure the\r\nwherewithal to appease our craving for food.  And while waiting for the\r\nsea to go down we employed our time usefully in cutting adrift the\r\nrigging by which the broken masts remained attached to the wreck, thus\r\ngiving the wreckage a chance to drive ashore upon the beach, where we\r\nshould eventually want it.\r\n\r\nAt length, however, when the sun had dropped to within some fifteen\r\ndegrees of the western horizon, and was shining full into the bay where\r\nthe wreck lay, the sea had so far gone down and the surf on the beach\r\nhad so far abated as to render it possible for us to land without\r\nincurring much risk of injury to our limbs; we therefore awoke Murdock--\r\nwho had passed most of the day in sleep--and, finding him in pretty good\r\nform after his long rest, forthwith proceeded to make the attempt.  The\r\ndistance which we had to traverse was a mere trifle of about fifty\r\nfathoms or thereabouts, and we did perfectly well until we reached the\r\ninner line of breakers; but there, as luck would have it, something went\r\nwrong with the boatswain, and without saying a word to either of us he\r\nsuddenly flung up his hands and disappeared, at the precise moment when\r\nthe comber had us in its grip and was about to fling us up on the beach,\r\nand when, consequently, it was most necessary that each of us should be\r\nperfectly free to look after himself.  Fortunately, however, we were all\r\nswimming close together, and as Murdock disappeared, Cunningham and I\r\nwith one accord dived and made a grab at him, catching him just as the\r\nbreaker curled over and broke, hurling us all forward in a smothering\r\nswirl of foam; and the next instant we were all being rolled over and\r\nover upon the sand.  Then, as we came to rest, I dug my toes and the\r\nfingers of my disengaged hand deep into the sand, ready for the\r\nbackwash, while, as it afterward appeared, Cunningham did the same; and\r\nafter a severe struggle of a few seconds' duration the water receded,\r\nleaving us stranded and gasping for breath, when Chips and Sails, who\r\nhad been on the watch, rushed down into the water, and, in obedience to\r\na gasped request from me, seized the boatswain's insensible body and\r\ndragged it up out of reach of the next breaker, while Cunningham and I\r\nscrambled to our feet and staggered after them.\r\n\r\nOnce ashore the boatswain soon recovered from his fainting fit, or\r\nwhatever it had been, whereupon we all seated ourselves in a circle upon\r\nthe sand and feasted upon bananas, afterwards slaking our thirst at a\r\nlittle runnel of deliciously cool, sweet water that the carpenter had\r\ndiscovered, earlier in the day, trickling out of the cliff at no great\r\ndistance from the point at which the wreck had come ashore.  And while\r\nwe were eating, the carpenter informed us that he and the sailmaker had\r\nbeen stretched out upon the schooner's cabin lockers, fast asleep, when\r\nshe struck upon the reef for the first time; and that, awakened by the\r\nviolence of the shock and the crash of the falling masts, they had\r\nleaped to their feet, and, scarcely knowing what they did, rushed up on\r\ndeck, only to be swept overboard the next instant by a heavy sea which\r\nbroke over the ship.  Neither of them knew, at the moment, what had\r\nbefallen the other; but from what they told us it was evident that the\r\nsame sea which washed them overboard swept the schooner's deck of\r\neverything and carried away her bulwarks: for when, fighting for breath,\r\nthey rose to the surface, each of them found himself close to a mass of\r\nfloating wreckage, to which he clung desperately, and so was eventually\r\nflung up on the beach, with the life so nearly battered out of him that\r\nit was just as much as either of them could do to crawl far enough up\r\nthe beach to get beyond the reach of the deadly backwash, when they both\r\ncollapsed, and so lay senseless until they were revived by the rays of\r\nthe morning sun.\r\n\r\nThere were, however, two still missing, namely, the cook and the cabin\r\nboy.  The former of these we found, quite dead, shut up in the stranded\r\ngalley; but exactly what became of the cabin boy we never knew, for we\r\nnever found a trace of him, alive or dead.  We buried the body of the\r\ncook that same evening in the sand, using fragments of splintered\r\nplanking wherewith to dig the grave, after which we flung ourselves down\r\nupon the dry sand above high-water mark, and, completely worn out, slept\r\nsoundly until the following morning.\r\n\r\nWe awoke shortly after sunrise, to find the weather gloriously fine, the\r\nTrade wind again blowing briskly, and, to our very great surprise, the\r\nwreck but a few yards from the shore, in very little over two feet of\r\nwater.  But a single glance around us at the greatly altered appearance\r\nof the beach, as compared with what we had seen of it on the previous\r\nday, sufficed to explain the apparent mystery.  The tide had something\r\nto do with it, of course, for it chanced that the schooner had come\r\nashore on the very top of the highest spring tide: but it was perfectly\r\nevident that, apart from this, the water in the bay had been piled up to\r\nquite an unusual height by the gale; hence when the storm had subsided\r\nand the ocean had once more found its normal level the wreck was left\r\nlittle short of high and dry.  This was quite a stroke of good luck for\r\nus; for we subsequently discovered that the range of tide in that\r\nparticular part of the ocean was so exceedingly small that, even at\r\nhigh-water, we were able to wade right out to the wreck, while the\r\nwreckage which had been cast ashore on the previous day was now lying\r\nhigh and dry far up the beach, and quite beyond the reach of the\r\nordinary tides.  We were thus saved a vast amount of trouble, for\r\nalthough, when we began salvage operations, it was still necessary to do\r\na certain amount of rafting in order to convey heavy articles ashore,\r\nlight articles, such as we could carry, could be taken thither by the\r\nsimple process of lowering them over the side to one of our companions,\r\nwho then carried them ashore in his arms or on his shoulders.\r\n\r\nBut there were one or two matters demanding our immediate attention, the\r\nfirst being breakfast, while the next was the settlement of the very\r\nimportant question whether or not the island happened to possess other\r\ninhabitants than ourselves, and, incidentally, if so, what would be\r\ntheir attitude toward us.  And this last was a matter of the most vital\r\nimportance to us; for our experience, gained during the collection of\r\nour cargo of sandalwood, was that while the natives of certain of the\r\nislands were gentle, kindly disposed toward strangers, and perfectly\r\nharmless, those of others were exceedingly jealous and suspicious,\r\nfierce, treacherous, bloodthirsty, and in some cases actually cannibals.\r\nOf course if it should so chance that we had been cast away upon an\r\nisland inhabited by natives possessing the last-named characteristics,\r\nour prospects of ultimate escape with our lives were what poor old\r\nSkipper Brown would have designated as \"purty slim\", and until the point\r\ncould be determined it behoved us to be exceedingly careful.  Therefore,\r\nafter discussing the matter at a sort of council of war, it was decided\r\nthat, important as it might be to explore the island and ascertain its\r\ncapabilities and limitations without delay, it was still more important\r\nand urgent to provide ourselves with the means of self-defence.\r\nAccordingly, while Chips and Sails again undertook to climb the cliff\r\nand procure some bananas for breakfast, Cunningham and I, accompanied by\r\nthe boatswain--who seemed, after a good night's rest, to be little the\r\nworse for the happenings of the previous day--agreed to wade off and\r\nboard the wreck, with the view of securing such weapons and ammunition\r\nas were come-at-able, and had not been spoiled by sea water.\r\n\r\nThe arms chest, although actually under water, was secured without\r\ndifficulty and carried ashore, together with several bottles of oil\r\nwhich we were able to rescue from the lazarette; and, this done,\r\nCunningham and I set to work, immediately after breakfast, thoroughly to\r\ndry, clean, and oil all the weapons and put them in perfect working\r\norder, although such ammunition as we had been able to find was\r\ncompletely ruined by sea water.  But I seemed to remember having heard\r\nour late skipper say that there was a reserve stock, packed in\r\nwaterproof zinc-lined cases, stowed away somewhere in the ship;\r\ntherefore, while Cunningham and I were engaged upon the task of cleaning\r\nthe arms, the other three men went aboard the wreck and proceeded\r\nsystematically to salve the entire contents of the lazarette, with the\r\nresult that, before the day's work was ended, they had found cases\r\nyielding no less than one thousand rounds of gun ammunition and two\r\nthousand revolver cartridges, all of which proved to be in perfect\r\ncondition.  We were thus pretty well provided with the means of\r\nself-defence, and, given something in the nature of a fairly strong\r\ndefensive position, ought to be able to render a reasonably good account\r\nof ourselves.\r\n\r\nThe next thing to be done was to find that defensive position; the\r\nfollowing day was therefore devoted to a thorough exploration of the\r\nisland by the entire party, the expedition setting out immediately after\r\nbreakfast, each of us being armed with cutlass, gun, and a brace of\r\nrevolvers, with a good supply of cartridges in our pockets.  Thus far we\r\nhad observed nothing indicating that the island was inhabited by others\r\nthan ourselves: but it must be remembered that the schooner had been\r\nwrecked in a bay hemmed in on the land side by cliffs, and that hitherto\r\nour farthest excursion had been to the top of the cliffs and just the\r\nfew yards inland which were necessary to enable us to procure bananas\r\nfrom the trees growing right up to the cliff edge; the remainder of the\r\nisland was therefore, so far, a _terra incognita_ to us all, and might,\r\nfor aught that we could tell to the contrary, be swarming with savages.\r\nWe therefore decided to proceed with caution, all keeping close\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\nTo scale the cliff proved a very easy matter, for the carpenter and\r\nsailmaker had, on their first day ashore, found what might be termed a\r\nsort of natural stairway zigzagging up it, consisting of a series of\r\nrock projections, or ledges, up and down which it was possible to pass\r\nwith little or no difficulty, and which served our purpose admirably.\r\n\r\nHaving climbed this stairway, we found ourselves at the top of the cliff\r\nand confronted by a dense undergrowth of jungle, consisting for the most\r\npart of an inextricable tangle of tough creepers, interspersed with\r\nshrubs and trees of various kinds, many of which seemed to be fruit\r\nbearers.  Among these we recognised the plantain, banana, custard-apple,\r\nloquat, granadilla, guava, pawpaw, and some others with which none of us\r\nwere acquainted; the fruit, however, was neither very plentiful nor very\r\nfine, most of the trees being so completely smothered with creepers that\r\nthey could get neither sun, air, nor room enough to grow properly.  We\r\npushed through this brake for about a mile, working steadily uphill all\r\nthe time, and frequently being compelled to cut a way for ourselves with\r\nour cutlasses, finally emerging upon a kind of ridge, bare of scrub, but\r\nrichly carpeted with guinea grass, with a few tall trees of various\r\nkinds scattered here and there about it.  But although this ridge, or\r\nplateau, was comparatively open, our view was still exceedingly\r\ncircumscribed, for we were hemmed in on every hand by the bush belt,\r\nwhich seemed completely to cover the entire island, except the plateau\r\nupon which we stood and the bald summit of the curious-looking hill or\r\nmountain about two miles distant.  The summit of this hill, which\r\nappeared to be flat, and which we estimated to be about three thousand\r\nfeet higher than the ridge upon which we were then standing, promised to\r\nafford us a perfect view of the whole island; therefore, as the day was\r\nstill young, we at once decided to make our way to and survey our domain\r\nfrom it.\r\n\r\nThe crest of the ridge upon which we stood appeared to lead straight\r\ntoward the mountain, moreover it was not nearly so densely overgrown as\r\nwas the lower ground; our progress, therefore, was tolerably rapid, and\r\nin the course of an hour we found ourselves clear of the bush and\r\nstanding upon the lower slopes of the mountain.  And then we knew that\r\nthe towering mass in front of us could be nothing else than a volcano,\r\neither dormant or extinct, for there was no sign of smoke rising from\r\nits summit, although the nature of the soil around us, consisting as it\r\ndid of pumice stone, scoriae, and ancient lava, left no doubt as to the\r\ncharacter of the mountain.\r\n\r\nAnd now began the really difficult part of our task.  Although the\r\nground was entirely bare of vegetation the surface was so exceedingly\r\nrough and broken, and so loose, that progress was very slow, becoming\r\nmore so with every forward step; for while the lower slopes of the\r\nmountain were of quite an easy grade, they rapidly steepened as we\r\nadvanced, until the last five hundred feet or so approached so nearly to\r\nthe perpendicular that at length further progress seemed to be all but\r\nimpossible, and we could only advance a yard or two at a time, climbing\r\nupon hands and knees, with short spells of rest between the spurts.\r\n\r\nBut when at length, about midday, we finally reached the summit, it was\r\nunanimously agreed that our toil was amply rewarded, for the entire\r\nisland lay stretched out at our feet like a map, with mile after mile of\r\nthe blue, foam-flecked ocean reaching far away to the horizon on every\r\nhand, while away in the south-western quarter, a hundred miles distant\r\nperhaps, there appeared a faint film of misty blue which indicated the\r\npresence of other land.  But this last was much too distant to interest\r\nus in any way; it was our own particular domain that absorbed all our\r\nattention, and the first thing that we observed about it was that its\r\nlength ran practically east and west.  It was of very irregular shape,\r\nthe most graphic way of describing it being, perhaps, to say that in\r\ngeneral outline it somewhat resembled a rather acute-angled triangle,\r\nwith two large pieces bitten out of it near the base, one bite having\r\nbeen taken out of the north side, while the other and larger had removed\r\nthe south-west angle and formed the bay in which lay the wreck.  The\r\nacute angle pointed toward the east, and the sides of the triangle were\r\nmuch twisted and broken.  The mountain, upon the summit of which we\r\nstood, occupied the middle of the eastern half of the island, and proved\r\nto be, as we had anticipated, the crater of an apparently extinct\r\nvolcano.  The interior of the crater was elliptical in shape, about a\r\nmile long by half a mile wide, and was a funnel-like opening about five\r\nthousand feet deep, with practically perpendicular sides.  It resembled,\r\nas much as anything, an enormous well, for there was water at the bottom\r\nof it, though probably of no great depth.  Also at the bottom, all round\r\nthe edge of the water and for some distance up the sides, there were\r\nenormous quantities of what we judged to be sulphur.\r\n\r\nThe top edge of the crater, which from below presented the appearance of\r\na flat-topped hill, was about thirty feet wide and tolerably level; we\r\ntherefore had no difficulty in walking right round it, and so obtaining\r\na complete view of the entire island, which was everywhere covered with\r\nverdure, save immediately round the base of the volcano.  But although\r\nthe outline of the island was very irregular, there were only two\r\nindentations worthy of the name of bays in it, namely, the one in which\r\nthe wreck lay, and which we at once decided to name South-west Bay, and\r\nanother at the north-west extremity of the island, which we named North\r\nBay.  These two bays were the only portions of the coastline possessing\r\nanything in the nature of a beach; and, that fact once established, we\r\nknew that if natives existed anywhere on the island, we should find\r\ntraces of them on one or the other of the bays.  But we had already\r\nlearned that there were none on the shore of South-west Bay; and now,\r\ncarefully examining the other bay, we could see no trace of canoes on\r\nits beach, or huts along its margin, neither could we detect the\r\nslightest sign of a smoke wreath in any direction.  We therefore finally\r\ncame to the conclusion that, excepting ourselves, the island was without\r\ninhabitants, and one source of anxiety was thereupon removed from our\r\nminds.\r\n\r\nStanding upon the edge of the crater and looking westward, we obtained a\r\nperfect view of the whole of the western half of the island, including\r\nboth bays; and, looking down upon the land below us from a great height,\r\nas we now did, we were able to form a very accurate idea of its origin,\r\nwhich we at once judged to be volcanic.  The entire island, in fact, was\r\nevidently the summit of a volcano projecting above the surface of the\r\nocean, the two bays above referred to having evidently been at one time\r\ntwo craters or vents for the internal fires, since both were encircled\r\nby reefs which had all the appearance of having been at one time part of\r\nthe lip of the respective craters.\r\n\r\nAs we stood up there, studying the conformation and general appearance\r\nof the island, we fell to discussing our future prospects, and soon\r\narrived at the conclusion that, situated just where the island happened\r\nto be, far away from all the regular ship tracks, its very existence\r\napparently unknown--since it was not marked upon the chart--it might be\r\nmonths, or even years, before we should be rescued by being taken off by\r\na ship; and that therefore our wisest course would be, first, to save\r\neverything possible from the wreck, and then carefully break her up,\r\nusing her timber to build some sort of a craft to convey us back to\r\ncivilisation.  This would at all events keep us busy and our minds\r\noccupied, giving us an object in life--something to strive for, think\r\nabout, and achieve--and thus preserve us all from falling into a low and\r\ndespondent frame of mind; and if in the end a ship should happen to\r\nappear and take us off, why, so much the better, while if nothing of the\r\nkind occurred we should in due time be able to effect our own escape.\r\nCunningham was particularly enthusiastic over the scheme; yacht\r\ndesigning, it appeared, was a hobby of his, and he promised us that if\r\nwe would only give him a free hand he would design us something which\r\nwould not only be fairly easy to build, but would also be safe and\r\ncomfortable, and quite capable of conveying us all to any part of the\r\nworld we might choose as our destination.  This struck me as a far too\r\nambitious project for five men to undertake; but when, later on, we\r\nagain discussed the matter, with a chart of the Pacific before us, and I\r\ndiscovered that the Sandwich Islands, the nearest civilised land, lay\r\nsome fourteen hundred miles distant, I changed my opinion.  I had\r\nalready done one ocean trip in an open boat, and had no desire to\r\nattempt another.\r\n\r\nOn our way back to the beach abreast the wreck, which now constituted\r\nour temporary home, we took a look at North Bay.  With this, as a place\r\nof residence, we instantly became violently enamoured: because, in the\r\nfirst place, it was open to the north-east Trade wind, and was therefore\r\nfar cooler and more pleasant than the beach of South-west Bay, shut in\r\nas the latter was under the lee of high cliffs, and opposed to the\r\nafternoon sun; next, there was a little stream of delicious fresh water\r\nfalling over a low cliff into a small rock basin, affording an ideal\r\nfreshwater bath; next, we discovered a fine large, perfectly dry cave,\r\nclose to the shore, with an entrance so narrow that it constituted of\r\nitself a perfect rock fortress; and, lastly, a large and varied\r\nassortment of very fine fruit trees was discovered growing quite close\r\nto the beach, only needing to be cleared of the undergrowth to make a\r\nsplendid orchard.  The one drawback to the bay was that it was about two\r\nmiles distant from the wreck, near which we should of necessity be\r\nobliged to establish our shipyard; but its many advantages so far\r\noutweighed this that we took possession of the cave there and then, and\r\nslept in it that night.\r\n\r\nAnd now ensued a particularly busy time for us all; for when we came to\r\nconsider the situation we found that there were several matters\r\ndemanding our attention, and they were all of so urgent a character that\r\nit was rather difficult for us to determine offhand which should be the\r\nfirst to receive it.  For, to begin with, we were all agreed that unless\r\nsomething quite unforeseen and unexpected, in the nature of a call at\r\nthe island by a ship, should occur in the meantime, we must be prepared\r\nfor a sojourn of at least a year in our present quarters; and that, of\r\ncourse, meant that we should be obliged to give serious consideration to\r\nthe question of the maintenance of our health, which, in its turn, meant\r\nthat we must carefully regulate our diet, and alter it as much as\r\npossible, not depending too much upon fruit, but varying it by a\r\nfrequent change to fish, our only possible alternative.\r\n\r\nBut we soon discovered that in order to catch fish, as well as for many\r\nother purposes, it was not only very desirable, but also almost\r\nimperatively necessary _that_ we should have something in the nature of\r\na boat, which, of course, remained to be built.  Then there was the\r\nsalvage of everything contained in the wreck of the schooner, including\r\nthe timber and metal of which she was built; to say nothing of certain\r\ngardening operations projected by Murdock, with the object of improving\r\nthe quality of the fruit growing in the immediate vicinity of our cave,\r\nthe cultivation of certain vegetables, and sundry other schemes having\r\nfor their object the betterment of our condition during the period of\r\nour sojourn upon the island--Murdock's hobby happening to be gardening,\r\nas Cunningham's happened to be yacht designing (and, as often happens\r\nwhen men take up some useful occupation as an amusement, both soon\r\nproved themselves to be exceptionally skilful in all matters relating to\r\ntheir respective hobbies).  Therefore, while Chips, Sails, and I went\r\nstrenuously to work upon the operation of salving everything that we\r\ncould find aboard the wreck, the boatswain, with the assistance of poor\r\nCooky's fire shovel, and a few other iron implements which he converted\r\ninto tools, devoted himself to the production of a fruit and vegetable\r\ngarden in the immediate neighbourhood of our cave dwelling, clearing\r\naway all the scrub which grew around and choked some two dozen fruit\r\ntrees, digging and hoeing up the soil, and planting therein every\r\npotato, onion, and bean that we could find for him among the cook's\r\nstores aboard the ship.  And while he and we were busy in the manner\r\ndescribed, Cunningham rescued a few sheets of paper and some lead\r\npencils from the skipper's cabin, carefully dried the former, sharpened\r\nthe latter, and, with an empty packing case for table, and a scale\r\nconstructed with the assistance of the carpenter's two-foot rule,\r\nassiduously devoted himself to the task of designing what he called a\r\n\"catamaran\" for immediate use, and then a small schooner by means of\r\nwhich we were eventually to make our escape from the island and return\r\nto civilisation.\r\n\r\nThe catamaran struck me as being a particularly simple and ingenious\r\naffair, some of its many merits consisting in the facts that it needed\r\nno moulds for its construction, that it could be built of any fragments\r\nof wreckage that were too short and too much splintered and damaged to\r\nbe of use in the construction of the schooner, and that it needed no\r\nvery elaborate working or shaping.  It consisted essentially of two\r\noblong tanks or boxes, each thirty feet long by two feet wide by two\r\nfeet six inches deep.  These boxes were not unlike a Thames fishing punt\r\nin shape, although they were, proportionately, much narrower and deeper.\r\nThe bottom of each was perfectly flat transversely, and also\r\nlongitudinally, except at the ends, where it curved up gradually in a\r\nsemi-parabola until it met the gunwale.  These two boxes, or punts,\r\nhaving been decked over and made perfectly watertight, were then joined\r\ntogether--with a space of eight feet between them--by stout beams, over\r\nthe after part of which was laid the schooner's wheel grating, to serve\r\nthe purpose of a deck; a broad-bladed steering paddle was fitted\r\nsecurely into a grommet attached to the aftermost beam; the punts were\r\nsimply rigged with an enormous lateen sail made out of the schooner's\r\ntattered foresail, and there we had a nondescript kind of craft, thirty\r\nfeet long by twelve feet beam, drawing only about eight inches of water\r\nwhen light and on an even keel, buoyant, unsinkable, and uncapsizable,\r\nwhich, when we came to try her, developed a speed under sail that was\r\npositively astounding, and went to windward like a racing cutter.\r\n\r\nShe was wet, of course, particularly when driven hard to windward, but\r\nin such a climate as we now enjoyed, to be drenched with salt water was\r\na pleasure rather than otherwise, and, regarded as a drawback, was not\r\nworth a moment's consideration.  It took us a month almost to a day to\r\nbuild and rig her complete; and after our first trial of her we almost\r\ninvariably used her to go to and fro between the two bays, although the\r\ntrip by water was about seven miles in length, as compared with the\r\nshort cut of two miles overland.  Yet we did it either way in a little\r\nover half an hour, while the sail home in the evening, after a hard\r\nday's work, was much the more exhilarating mode of travelling of the\r\ntwo.  And what, perhaps, gratified us as much as anything in connection\r\nwith the construction of this exceedingly useful craft was that in\r\nbuilding her we had not been obliged to touch the schooner at all, but\r\nhad drawn for our material entirely upon the loose wreckage of bulwarks\r\nand so on that we had found strewn about the beach on the day after the\r\nwreck, together with four stout saplings which we cut down to serve as\r\nbeams, and which we found to be exceedingly tough and in many respects\r\nto resemble elm.\r\n\r\nAnd while the carpenter, the boatswain, Sails, and I had been\r\nstrenuously at work upon the construction of the catamaran, Cunningham\r\nhad been quite as industriously employed upon his design for the\r\nproposed schooner, working alone, day after day, in our cave dwelling\r\nround at North Bay, evolving his half-breadth and body plans, his\r\nmidship section, buttock lines, water lines, diagonals, and all the rest\r\nof it; ruling in, rubbing out again, calculating, altering, modifying,\r\nand patiently labouring to get his several drawings to agree accurately\r\nwith each other, and resolutely refusing to be satisfied until he had\r\ngot everything exactly to his liking: and at length he was able to\r\ndisplay to us, not altogether without pride, the completed draught of as\r\npretty a little ship as I think I ever set eyes upon.  He had taken, as\r\nthe foundation of his design, the shape of the _Zenobia's_ gig, in which\r\nwe had made our memorable Atlantic voyage, and out of which we had been\r\ntaken by poor old Skipper Brown, that fine little craft having produced\r\na profound impression upon him, in consequence of the splendid qualities\r\nas a sea boat which she had exhibited.  But the new craft was of course\r\nto be much bigger than the gig, for she was not only to be completely\r\ndecked from stem to stern, but was to be sufficiently roomy in her\r\ninterior to enable us to perform a voyage of over a thousand miles with\r\na very fair measure of comfort.  Her principal dimensions, therefore,\r\nwere forty feet on the water line by ten feet beam; and, in order to\r\nprovide a reasonable amount of headroom below, as also to make her\r\nweatherly, she was considerably deeper in proportion than the gig, and\r\nmuch sharper in the floor, this providing her with plenty of power for\r\nher size, by means of which she would be enabled to make good way even\r\nin a heavy head sea.  Her bow was an almost exact reproduction of that\r\nof the gig, rather long and overhanging, with plenty of \"flare\" to lift\r\nher over a head sea, and she was provided with an even longer counter,\r\nwhich gave her after-body a remarkably smooth and easy delivery; while,\r\nfor the rest, her water lines were almost those of a racing yacht, so\r\nthat I concluded she would be exceedingly nimble under her canvas.\r\nAltogether we were immensely pleased with, and not a little impressed by\r\nCunningham's effort; but I could not help reminding the others that it\r\nwas one thing to draught a smart little vessel on paper, and quite\r\nanother to build her with such resources as we had at our disposal.\r\nChips, however, who of course knew--or should have known--more about\r\nsuch matters than any of the rest of us, while not exactly pooh-poohing\r\nmy reminder, was confident that--as he expressed it--we were men enough\r\nto bring the scheme to fruition; and with that assertion I was obliged,\r\nby no means unwillingly, to rest satisfied.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, however, a great deal still remained to be done before we\r\ncould start work upon the new schooner; for although we had by this time\r\nsalved everything from the wreck--and it was astonishing how much and\r\nwhat a wide variety of things we found in her--she still remained to be\r\nbroken up; and we agreed that that should be our next job.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THIRTEEN.\r\n\r\nTWO IMPORTANT EVENTS OCCUR.\r\n\r\nIt may be thought that there is little or nothing of interest to be\r\nfound in the operation of breaking up the wreck of a ship, but I, who\r\nhave assisted in such an operation, can testify most strongly to the\r\ncontrary; for when the work is undertaken as we undertook to break up\r\nthe wreck of the _Martha Brown_--that is to say, carefully, taking her\r\napart plank by plank and beam by beam, exactly reversing, in fact, the\r\nseveral processes by which she was put together--there is plenty of both\r\ninterest and instruction to be found in observing the numberless\r\ningenious devices which have been resorted to by the shipwright to join\r\ntogether the several members of the hull in such a manner as to ensure\r\nthe maximum of strength, so that, when once joined together, no strain\r\nshort of that involving the absolute destruction of the material should\r\nbe capable of pulling them apart again.  We who had been aboard the\r\nschooner during the time of her passage across the reef, and had\r\nexperienced in our own persons the terrific violence of the shocks to\r\nwhich she had then been subjected, were amazed that she had not been\r\nshattered like an _egg_ shell; but when, later on, we came to dismember\r\nher, we were still more amazed to find how little damage, comparatively\r\nspeaking, she had sustained while passing through that fearful ordeal on\r\nthe reef, and what extraordinary exertions were needed to wrench her\r\nseveral parts asunder.  But a detailed description of the varied schemes\r\nto which we were obliged to resort in order to effect our purpose would\r\nbe of no interest to the general reader; I will therefore content myself\r\nwith the bare statement that it cost us six weeks of the hardest labour\r\nI ever performed in my life to reduce the _Martha Brown_ to her\r\ncomponent parts, and to stack the materials upon the beach in readiness\r\nfor use in the construction of the new schooner.\r\n\r\nIn fairness to ourselves, however, it must be said that during part of\r\nthat time there were only four of us engaged upon the work, Cunningham\r\nbeing busy upon calculations of stability, the relative positions of the\r\ncentre of gravity and the metacentre of the new schooner, and I know not\r\nwhat beside, in connection with the determination of the amount of\r\nballast that would be needed, the position of the masts, and the area\r\nand proportions of the several sails--for now that the engineer was\r\nfairly mounted upon his new hobby there was no possibility of dragging\r\nhim out of the saddle.  He had several novel theories which he was\r\nanxious to test, and he was resolutely determined that the new schooner\r\nshould be as nearly perfect as his skill could make her; he therefore\r\nsimply scoffed at us when we pointed out that time was flying,\r\nindignantly demanded to be told what mattered a few days more or less in\r\ncomparison with the importance of the matters with which he was dealing,\r\nand returned to his figures with renewed zest.\r\n\r\nBut all things come to an end sooner or later, and the day at length\r\narrived when Cunningham completed his final calculation, drew his last\r\nline, and carefully rolled up his completed drawings, to await the\r\nmoment when they would be called for upon the beginning of the important\r\ntask of laying the keel of the new schooner.\r\n\r\nNow, if I have succeeded in portraying anything like a true picture of\r\nour life upon the island, the reader will have gathered the impression\r\nthat, after the first day following the wreck, we were constantly in a\r\ncondition of breathless activity, due to the fact that there were so\r\nmany matters, each of apparently paramount importance, all clamouring\r\nfor our instant attention, and that, at the beginning at least, we\r\nstrove to attend to all these several matters at the same time, doing\r\nfirst a little to this, and then a little to that or the other,\r\naccording to what we believed at the moment to be most pressing.  And\r\nthis state of affairs prevailed with us until we had salved everything\r\npossible from the wreck, and until we had built our catamaran; after\r\nwhich we felt that we might with advantage adopt some sort of system in\r\nthe arrangement of our work.\r\n\r\nNow among a number of the things that we desired to do, but had\r\npostponed in favour of other matters, which had seemed more pressingly\r\nurgent, was the exploration of our cave.  This cave was situated only\r\nsome thirty yards from the beach, in North Bay, in the heart of a\r\nsteeply rising acclivity which gradually merged itself in the plateau\r\nconstituting the western extremity of the island.  It was only by the\r\nmerest accident that we had discovered the existence of the cavern on\r\nthat day when we undertook the exploration of the island--although there\r\nis no doubt that we should have found it sooner or later--for the\r\nentrance was so small that only one person could pass through at a time,\r\nand even then only in a crouching position; and it was this latter\r\ncircumstance which at first so strongly commended the place to us as a\r\nresidence, for it was in fact quite a stronghold in its way, being\r\ncapable of defence for a practically unlimited period by a single armed\r\nman.  Once past that low and narrow opening, however, one found oneself\r\nin quite a spacious chamber of roughly circular shape, some thirty feet\r\nin diameter by about twelve feet high, with a perfectly smooth, dry,\r\nsandy floor, rendering the cave a most comfortable place of abode, as we\r\ndiscovered when we had taken up our quarters in it.\r\n\r\nThereafter we had all been so strenuously busy that, with the exception\r\nof Cunningham, we had used the cave merely as a sleeping place; while\r\nthe engineer, absorbed in his drawings and calculations, had never\r\nthought of exploring the cave and examining its extent, resting\r\nsatisfied with the knowledge that the place was amply large enough for\r\nall our requirements, while the situation of the island rendered the\r\npresence of wild animals or noxious reptiles within it an impossibility.\r\nAnd so, absorbed in our various occupations, we had allowed the matter\r\nto go on from day to day, recognising, in an abstract sort of fashion,\r\nthe fact that it would be no more than an act of common prudence to\r\nexamine the cavern, but daily postponing the examination until a more\r\nconvenient season.  Thus the matter had been allowed to slide until the\r\nday finally arrived when Cunningham reached the end of his labours--\r\nrather earlier than he had anticipated--and, having put away his papers,\r\nsuddenly bethought him that here at last was his opportunity to give the\r\ninterior of the cavern a thorough overhaul.  He accordingly provided\r\nhimself with an abundant supply of dry branches, to serve as torches,\r\nlighted one of them, and proceeded forthwith to investigate, with the\r\nresult that about an hour later he startled us all by unexpectedly\r\nemerging from behind a thick clump of bushes on the beach of South-west\r\nBay and frantically waving a lighted torch in his hand, under the\r\ninfluence of such violent excitement that when we dropped work, and ran\r\nto him to learn what was the matter, we found him to all intents and\r\npurposes incoherent for the moment.\r\n\r\n\"Hurrah, you chaps, hurrah!\" he yelled, waving the flaming torch above\r\nhis head as he advanced to meet us.  \"Aren't we a lot of lucky dogs, eh?\r\nCheer, you beggars, cheer, and split your throats!  Who wouldn't be\r\nshipwrecked, if they could meet with such a slice of luck as ours?  By\r\nGeorge!--I say, Temple, kick me, old chap, will ye, just to convince me\r\nthat I'm awake.\"\r\n\r\n\"Steady, man, steady!\"  I returned, seizing him by the shoulder and\r\ngiving him a good shaking.  \"What in the world is the matter with you,\r\nand what is all the excitement about?  You don't mean to say that\r\nthere's a ship in sight, standing in for the island, do you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ship!\" he retorted, in accents of ineffable contempt; \"not much, there\r\nisn't.  No, it is something infinitely better than that.  It is this, my\r\nson, that when we leave this island we do so as a little bunch of\r\nbloated plutocrats--millionaires, my boy, millionaires!\"\r\n\r\n\"Millionaires!\"  I ejaculated.  \"What on earth does the man mean?  What\r\nare you driving at, Cunningham?  Can't you pull yourself together and\r\ntell us in plain English what has happened?\"\r\n\r\n\"I know,\" exclaimed Parsons, with sudden illumination.  \"He've found a\r\nburied treasure!  Ain't that it, Mr Cunnin'ham?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ay,\" answered Cunningham, \"you are right, in a way, Chips, certainly.\r\nBut it is no pirates' hoard that I have found--no chests heaped high\r\nwith cups and candlesticks of gold and silver and jewelled weapons, and\r\noverflowing with necklaces, bracelets, and rings torn from the persons\r\nof shrieking women; it is something far better than that.  It is a gold\r\nmine, in the heart of yonder hill.\"\r\n\r\n\"A gold mine!\"  I returned, in accents of deep disappointment.  \"Surely\r\nthat is nothing to get into such a tremendous state of excitement about.\r\nWe have no tools with which to work it, and--\"\r\n\r\n\"Tools!\" repeated Cunningham with withering scorn; \"we have all the\r\ntools we shall need.  See this,\" and he produced from his pocket a\r\nnodule of a dull, reddish-yellow colour, of irregular shape, and about\r\nthe size of a small egg.  \"I picked this out of the soil with my\r\nfingers.  And there is plenty more where this came from.\"\r\n\r\nI took the nugget in my hand and examined it curiously.  There was\r\nnothing very remarkable about it excepting its weight, which was very\r\ngreat for an object of its size.  But it was gold, without a doubt; I\r\nhad seen and examined gold nuggets before, and could not be deceived.\r\n\r\n\"Where did you find this?\"  I asked, as I passed the thing on to Murdock\r\nfor his inspection.\r\n\r\n\"In our cave--or rather in a passage leading from it to this beach,\"\r\nanswered Cunningham, who had by this time regained his composure.  \"You\r\nsee,\" he continued, \"the way of it was this.  I have finished my\r\ncalculations and drawings--finished them rather earlier to-day than I\r\nexpected; and I thought that, as I had an hour or two to spare, I might\r\nas well employ the time in giving the cavern a thorough overhaul.\r\nAccordingly I provided myself with some dry branches to serve as\r\ntorches, lighted up, and proceeded to look round.  Then I found that, as\r\nI have more than once suspected, there was an opening at the back end of\r\nthe cavern, giving access to another chamber almost as large as the one\r\nwhich we occupy; while beyond that again there are other passages and\r\nchambers--seven of the latter in all--communicating with each other, and\r\nending in a long, tortuous cleft forming a passage which leads out\r\nthere, behind those bushes.  But it is the last chamber of all, the one\r\nnearest in this direction, that is the marvel.  Unlike the others--all\r\nrock chambers--the one about which I am now speaking is a great hollow\r\nin what appears to be a `fault' of stiff clay; and, man alive, that clay\r\nis as thick with gold nuggets as a pudding is thick with plums!  There\r\nmust be more than a hundredweight of nuggets actually in sight,\r\nprotruding from the walls and floor of that chamber, every one of which\r\nmay be picked out with no other tools than a man's fingers; so what\r\nthere is hidden, and just waiting to be dug out, heaven only knows, but\r\nthere must be tons upon tons of it!  Come and see for yourselves.  Never\r\nmind about your work for the rest of the day, come and look at your\r\nfortunes; it is not every day that you will see such a sight, I give you\r\nmy word.\"\r\n\r\nWell, of course, you will guess that we did not need a second\r\ninvitation.  There were we, five men cast away upon an uncharted island\r\nin mid-Pacific, far from all the usual ship tracks; our hopes of rescue\r\nconsisting in the possibility that we might be taken off, sooner or\r\nlater, by a stray whaler, or, failing that, of effecting our escape\r\neventually in a craft to be built by ourselves--provided that we should\r\nprove possessed of the requisite skill to build her out of the materials\r\nat our disposal.  At that moment, and under those circumstances, gold\r\nwas just about as valueless to us as the pebbles on the beach; yet such\r\nis the magic of the word that no sooner was gold mentioned than we all\r\nincontinently dropped our tools, and, quite forgetting that it might be\r\nour fate never to escape at all from the island, eagerly followed\r\nCunningham, consumed with impatience to view this wonderful find of his.\r\n\r\nAnd wonderful, in truth, it was.  The way to it was through what\r\nCunningham had aptly described as a cleft, the outer extremity of which\r\nwas in the face of the cliff, so completely concealed from the beach by\r\na clump of bushes that it might never have been discovered, except by\r\nthe merest accident.  The cleft was exceedingly tortuous as to\r\ndirection, narrow, so low that in places it was necessary to go down\r\nupon hands and knees to effect a passage, full of awkward and unexpected\r\nprojections, rough and uneven of floor, with here and there little pools\r\nof water which had dripped from the roof and sides.  We traversed about\r\na mile of this, and then suddenly emerged into a great, shapeless hollow\r\nin what appeared to be a wide stratum of stiff brown clay, sandwiched\r\nbetween two almost vertical layers of sandstone, which seemed to have\r\nbeen turned over during some tremendous natural convulsion, perhaps when\r\nthe island was hove up above the surface of the sea.  And what\r\nCunningham had said respecting the abundance of gold was strictly and\r\nliterally true: the nuggets were as thickly arranged, proportionately,\r\nas raisins in a Christmas pudding; there were hundreds of them in sight,\r\nsingly, at distances apart of not much more than a foot, and in little\r\ngroups of half a dozen or more, almost touching each other.  Within two\r\nminutes I dug out, with my fingers only, a nugget shaped somewhat like a\r\npotato and as big as an orange, and the dislodging of that revealed\r\nanother sticking in the clay behind it.  Naturally we all with one\r\naccord went to work picking out nuggets, some using our bare fingers\r\nonly, while those who happened to have knives about them used them.  In\r\nthe course of half an hour we had each picked out as many nuggets as we\r\ncould dispose about our persons, and then the lessening number of\r\ntorches warned us that it was high time to beat a retreat; but our\r\nlabours seemed to have produced no visible effect, for where we had\r\nremoved one nugget we had, as a rule, disclosed another.  I estimated\r\nthat, during that short half-hour, each of us had collected an average\r\nof about seven pounds weight of gold.\r\n\r\nNow, for a day or two after this discovery, it threatened to be a most\r\nserious misfortune; for the ability to acquire large quantities of gold\r\nat the mere cost of the exertion necessary to pick it out of the soil\r\nappealed so strongly to the boatswain, carpenter, and sailmaker that\r\nduring the two days immediately following Cunningham's sensational\r\nannouncement they absolutely refused to do any work whatever except dig\r\nout nuggets of gold, and the more they gathered the more eager did they\r\nappear to be to gather more.  But at the end of that time, the fact that\r\nCunningham and I had steadfastly refrained from the display of any\r\nanxiety to share in their good fortune, having, on the contrary, pursued\r\nthe task of breaking up the wreck, together with our reiterated\r\ninsistance on the greater importance of the work upon which we were\r\nengaged, steadied them a bit; and by the end of the second day we\r\ndetected signs that the sharp edge of their enthusiasm had worn off, and\r\nthat they were once more beginning to think.  Then Cunningham and I\r\nproceeded to remind them of a fact to which, at the outset, they\r\nstubbornly refused to listen, namely, that we knew where the gold was,\r\nand could get it at any time; but the matter which most vitally\r\nconcerned us was to get the schooner built and in the water as quickly\r\nas possible, so that, should it become necessary for us to quit the\r\nisland in haste, we might have the means to do so.  The three\r\nrecalcitrants came to see this at last, persuaded thereto, perhaps, by a\r\nrather exaggerated attitude of indifference to the gold on the part of\r\nCunningham and myself, and an equally exaggerated anxiety to push on\r\nwith the schooner; with the ultimate result that on the morning of the\r\nthird day they rather shamefacedly announced their readiness to turn-to\r\nagain, and accompanied us to South-west Bay.  But what put the finishing\r\ntouch to the matter was Cunningham's audacious proposal to ballast the\r\nschooner entirely with gold, and sail in her direct home to England.\r\nThis idea very strongly appealed to their somewhat crude imaginations,\r\nespecially when the engineer took a sheet of paper and proved to them by\r\nfigures that if we could obtain gold enough to carry out this plan, the\r\nvalue of it, equally divided among the five of us, would enable each to\r\nbank upward of half a million; which, if judiciously invested, would\r\nprovide us with an income of somewhere about two thousand pounds\r\nsterling per month!  Such figures as these naturally appealed to men\r\nwhose incomes hitherto had amounted to about five pounds per month, and\r\nthey were immediately all on fire to build the Schooner, if only to see\r\nhow much gold she could be induced to carry as ballast.\r\n\r\nHad there been a shipwright in our party he would probably have been\r\nintensely amused at the lightheartedness and assured confidence with\r\nwhich we approached the task of building a schooner, small, certainly,\r\nbut complete in every respect, out of the timbers and planking of the\r\ndismembered _Martha Brown_.  I do not believe that anyone excepting\r\nmyself had the slightest suspicion of the difficulties that we were so\r\ncheerfully facing; but by the time that we had got the keel blocks laid,\r\nand were preparing to shape and put together the keel, it began to dawn\r\nupon us that we had undertaken a distinctly formidable task, and one in\r\nwhich we might very easily fail should we once permit ourselves to\r\nbecome discouraged.  Indeed, the getting out of the keel was in itself a\r\nwork of such difficulty that Chips more than once threw down his tools\r\nand pronounced the task impossible, demanding the revision and\r\nsimplification of the design.\r\n\r\nBut Cunningham was deeply in love with the design which he had worked\r\nout with so much care--and so indeed was I; therefore we resolutely\r\nresisted Parsons' demands, and insisted that all that was needed was\r\npatience and the resolution to take the necessary pains, and in the end\r\nwe got our own way and the work proceeded.  But it proceeded with what,\r\nto me, was painful slowness, there being days occasionally on which the\r\nembryo ship presented precisely the same appearance when we knocked off\r\nwork in the evening that she had done when we started in the morning,\r\nthe whole day having been consumed in cutting out and putting together\r\nthe several pieces of timber which were subsequently to be worked into\r\nher hull.  Nevertheless, patience and perseverance worked wonders, and\r\nby and by, after we had been steadily at work for close upon six months,\r\na day came when we were able to stand and gaze admiringly at the\r\ncompleted skeleton of as smart a little vessel as I ever set eyes upon.\r\nIf she possessed a fault in my eyes it was that she presented altogether\r\ntoo smart an appearance, being, in model, nothing less than an\r\nexceedingly beautiful little yacht; and according to my merchant\r\nseaman's view of the matter a forty-foot yacht was not precisely the\r\nkind of craft best adapted to navigate the thousands of miles of ocean\r\nthat lay between ourselves and home.  Yet when Cunningham challenged me\r\nto point out what I regarded as faults, I was met at every turn by\r\narguments which seemed quite unanswerable, so that at last I was driven\r\nto take refuge in the adage that the proof of the pudding is in the\r\neating, and to acknowledge that if the vessel only behaved half as well\r\nas her designer asserted she would, I should be more than satisfied.\r\n\r\nNow, although there were five of us--all young and in the very pink of\r\ncondition--engaged upon the work of building the schooner, there were\r\ntimes when the united strength of all hands scarcely sufficed to\r\naccomplish some particular task, such as the setting up of a pair of\r\nframes, or the bending and fastening of a stringer; consequently we\r\nwelcomed, almost literally with open arms, the arrival of two\r\nable-bodied assistants, who came to us under somewhat singular\r\ncircumstances.\r\n\r\nFrom the day of the wreck, when we found ourselves castaways, up to the\r\nmoment when, as I have said above, we were able to gaze upon the\r\ncomplete skeleton of our new schooner, we had enjoyed an uninterrupted\r\ncontinuance of perfect weather; but a few days after the date referred\r\nto the Trade wind died away, and all the indications pointed toward the\r\napproach of another hurricane.  And indeed we were allowed barely\r\nsufficient time to make everything about the shipyard secure when our\r\nanticipations were realised by the outburst of a hurricane which, if it\r\nwas not as violent as the one that had shipwrecked us, was more than\r\nsufficiently so to compel us completely to suspend our building\r\noperations for two whole days.  These we spent in the cavern diligently\r\nand systematically digging for gold, under the direction and supervision\r\nof Cunningham; and I may as well mention here that the results of the\r\ntwo days' labours demonstrated that we had been lucky enough to stumble\r\nupon what is probably the most fabulously rich \"pocket\" of gold nuggets\r\nthat has ever been discovered by man.\r\n\r\nThe gale broke some time during the night of the second day, and when we\r\nawoke and turned out on the following morning the weather had reverted\r\nto its normal delightful conditions, and only a heavy south-westerly sea\r\nremained as evidence of what had been.  I think I have already mentioned\r\nthat it was our habit to proceed to and fro between North and South-west\r\nBays in the catamaran, in preference to tramping two miles overland in\r\nthe tropical heat; but on this particular day we walked, being of\r\nopinion that it was hardly desirable to expose the catamaran to the\r\nstrain of a trip round the end of the island in so steep and heavy a\r\nsea.  Knocking-off work at the usual time, we climbed the cliffs and\r\nproceeded to walk back to North Bay across the plateau, the boatswain,\r\ncarpenter, and sailmaker leading the way, while Cunningham and I\r\nfollowed, about a hundred yards behind, a distance which was more than\r\nsufficient to allow the trio to get out of sight ahead of us.  And as\r\nCunningham and I sauntered along very slowly we had no expectation of\r\nseeing anything more of Murdock and his companions until our arrival at\r\nthe cave; consequently we were a little surprised, upon our emerging\r\nfrom the jungle, to find the three seamen standing in the open, upon the\r\nhighest point of the plateau, all gazing intently to seaward.\r\n\r\n\"What is it, Murdock?\"  I shouted, as we hastened our steps to join\r\nthem.  \"Anything in sight?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, yes, Mr Temple,\" answered the boatswain, facing round toward us.\r\n\"There's something floatin', about a couple o' mile off there, that\r\nlooks like a boat with people in her.\"\r\n\r\n\"A boat!\"  I ejaculated.  \"Where away?  Show me!\"\r\n\r\n\"Come here, sir, and stand where I am,\" replied Murdock.  Then, as I\r\ntook up a position on the spot indicated, the man placed himself behind\r\nme, and proceeded to point over my shoulder.\r\n\r\n\"See that there low bush, yonder, Mr Temple, just in line with my\r\nfinger?\" he demanded.  \"Very well, then.  Just run your eye along about\r\na p'int, or maybe a little more, to the west'ard, and--there! d'ye see\r\nher, sir?  Ah, now she's vanished again in the trough.  But you keep\r\nyour eye gazin' in that direction and you'll--there she is again!  See\r\nher, sir?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ay, I do,\" said I, as I caught a momentary glimpse of a small dark\r\nobject which appeared for a moment, hovering on the crest of a sea, and\r\nthen sank out of sight again.  And, as Murdock had said, it certainly\r\npresented very much the appearance of a small boat drifting slowly away\r\ntoward the south-west before the freshening Trade wind.  Moreover,\r\nalthough the glimpse I had caught had been but momentary, I thought I\r\nhad detected the appearance of what might very well be a crouching human\r\nfigure sitting in her.  Presently I got another sight of the thing, and\r\nmy impression that it was indeed a boat--or possibly a canoe--with one\r\nor more persons in her was so greatly strengthened that I determined\r\nthere and then to investigate.\r\n\r\n\"I really believe you are right, Murdock,\" said I.  \"At all events it\r\nlooks so much like a boat--with people in her--that we certainly ought\r\nto satisfy ourselves.  So, come along, one of you; we'll take the\r\ncatamaran and go off to her.  If it really is a boat, and there are\r\npeople in her, it is very evident that they are too utterly exhausted to\r\nmake the island, and if they miss it they will inevitably perish.  Come\r\nalong; we have not a moment to waste if we are to save the daylight.\"\r\n\r\nWith one accord each of my companions stepped forward, eager to\r\naccompany me the moment that there was a question of saving life; but I\r\nneeded only one man, and I chose Murdock, as being the smartest seaman\r\nand the strongest man among them: and without further ado we took to our\r\nheels and raced to the beach, I shouting over my shoulder to Cunningham\r\nto stay where he was and guide us by signalling with his hands the\r\ndirection in which we should steer.\r\n\r\nAs I had said, we had not a moment to waste, for the sun's disk was even\r\nthen within a finger's breadth of the horizon, and darkness followed\r\nsunset with amazing swiftness in that latitude.  Murdock and I therefore\r\nran at our utmost speed to the beach, cast adrift the catamaran, sprang\r\naboard her, thrust her head offshore, and then threw ourselves upon the\r\nhalyards and mast-headed the yard, when I seized the steering paddle and\r\nheaded the craft for an opening between the breakers on the reef, while\r\nMurdock stationed himself beside me, with his hand shielding his eyes as\r\nhe stared seaward, anxiously watching for the first glimpse of the\r\nobject of which we were in pursuit.\r\n\r\nFor the moment, however, his efforts were useless, as he and I both\r\nknew, for the object had been so far to the westward when last seen that\r\nwe could not hope to sight her until we were fairly beyond the limits of\r\nthe bay; and when this at length happened the upper edge of the sun's\r\ndisk was just visible above the western horizon, sinking beneath it at\r\nthe precise moment when the catamaran shot through the opening between\r\ntwo formidable walls of breakers, which were dashing themselves into\r\nspray thirty feet high as they hurled themselves upon the lava reef.\r\n\r\nThe boat, or whatever it was, ought now to be within the range of our\r\nvision, and Murdock intently scrutinised the darkening sea ahead for\r\nsome sign of it, but in vain.  Then he turned his glances shoreward and\r\nsaw Cunningham standing on the verge of the bluff, vigorously waving us\r\nto keep away.\r\n\r\n\"Put up your hellum a bit, sir,\" he admonished me, with his eye still\r\nupon Cunningham; then--\"Steady!\" as he saw the engineer fling both hands\r\nabove his head, and almost at the same instant I caught the faintest\r\nglimpse imaginable of a small dark spot appearing for a moment in\r\nghostly fashion against the creaming head of a distant breaker, just\r\nclear of the lower end of our lateen yard.\r\n\r\n\"There she is!\"  I exclaimed, and as I spoke a star glimmered out of the\r\ndeepening blue almost immediately above the spot where the object had\r\nappeared.\r\n\r\n\"Where away, sir?\" demanded the boatswain, again peering ahead under the\r\nsharp of his hand.\r\n\r\n\"Do you see that star?\"  I responded, pointing with my disengaged hand.\r\n\"Well, she is about half a point to the westward--there she is again,\r\nstraight ahead!\"\r\n\r\n\"I see her, sir; I see her,\" answered Murdock.  \"Steady as you go, Mr\r\nTemple, and we're bound to pick her up.\"\r\n\r\nI thought so too, although the darkness was falling about us with the\r\nrapidity of a sea fog gathering.  Still, the star was a splendid guide,\r\nand steering by it we caught two or three additional glimpses of the\r\nobject before the darkness completely enveloped us.  Moreover, the\r\ncatamaran was slashing along at racing speed, smothering us with spray\r\nevery time she hit the crest of a wave; and now my chief fear was that\r\nthis same spray might so effectually conceal our surroundings at the\r\nprecise moment when we most needed to see, namely, when we were\r\nsurmounting a comber, that we might unwittingly overshoot our mark.\r\nTherefore at very brief intervals I admonished Murdock to \"keep his eyes\r\nskinned\", at the same time myself keeping as sharp a lookout as I could.\r\nI estimated that, with the breeze then blowing, we ought to cover the\r\ndistance between the object and ourselves in about six or seven minutes\r\nafter clearing the reef, but I had no means of judging the time, except\r\nby guesswork, out there in the darkness, and I was on tenterhooks lest\r\nwe should miss the thing and stand too far out, when the chances would\r\nbe all against our picking her up on the return journey.  Therefore at\r\nlast, feeling that we must be pretty close to the object of our quest, I\r\nsent Murdock forward, believing that he would have a better chance of\r\npicking her up from there than by standing alongside me, although his\r\nfigure would greatly obscure my own view.\r\n\r\nAccordingly the boatswain went right forward into the very eyes of the\r\ncatamaran, where he would be clear of the heaviest of the flying spray;\r\nand he had scarcely taken his station when, without looking round, he\r\nsuddenly shouted:\r\n\r\n\"There she is, sir!  Keep her away or you'll be on to her; hard up, sir!\r\nSo, steady!  Now, hard down and shake her.  That'll do, sir; keep her\r\nat that.  Luff a bit yet, sir.  So, steady!\" and, dashing aft, the\r\nboatswain snatched up a small coil of line that we had made ready for\r\nthe purpose, and hurled himself recklessly at a dark mass that at that\r\nmoment came sliding close past what had been our lee side before I\r\nluffed the catamaran into the wind.  I heard the splashing clatter of\r\nhis boots as he landed upon certain objects that sounded like loose\r\npaddles lying washing about in the bottom of the canoe--for such I now\r\nsaw the craft to be; saw him stoop, as though making fast the rope he\r\nhad taken with him; and then he shouted: \"All fast, sir; let her go\r\noff!\"  I put up the helm of the catamaran, and as she fell off and began\r\nto gather fresh way Murdock hauled his prize up alongside and scrambled\r\nout of her, snubbing the towline to a length of about two fathoms.\r\n\r\n\"It's a canoe, sir,\" he reported as he rose to his feet beside me, \"and\r\nthere's people aboard her--natives--four or five, I sh'd say, though I\r\ndidn't stop to count 'em; and I'm blest if I know whether they're alive\r\nor dead, but I think there must be life in one of 'em at least, for when\r\nI jumped into her I stumbled over one, and I thought I heard a groan.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said I, \"I hope we have been in time to save the poor beggars.\r\nI suspect that they belong to the island that is visible from the\r\ncrater, about a hundred miles to the south-west of us, and that they\r\nwere caught in the gale and blown out to sea.  If so, they have been at\r\nsea three whole nights and two days, drenched all the time with the\r\nflying spray, buffeted with the wind, and labouring hard all the while\r\nto keep their cockleshell of a craft afloat.  And these islanders are\r\nnot very tough when it comes to facing prolonged exposure of that kind.\"\r\n\r\nWe got the catamaran round and headed her for the island, with the canoe\r\nin tow, the carpenter having been thoughtful enough to light a fire on\r\nthe beach to serve as a guide to us; and a quarter of an hour later we\r\nwere ashore again, with Cunningham, Chips, and Sails tenderly lifting\r\nfive natives out of the half-swamped canoe and laying them on the sand,\r\nclose to the fire, while Murdock and I secured the catamaran.  By the\r\ntime that we had done this, Cunningham had got to work upon the new\r\narrivals, in two of whom he found signs of life, while the other three\r\nhe pronounced doubtful.  Then, under his directions, we each took a\r\nbody, which we proceeded vigorously to chafe and slap with our bare\r\nhands, varying the treatment with occasional attempts to administer a\r\nlittle stimulant, with the object of restoring the suspended circulation\r\nof the blood; and eventually--not to dwell at unnecessary length upon\r\nthis episode--we succeeded in restoring two of them, but the remaining\r\nthree defied our utmost efforts, although we worked at them until late\r\ninto the night.  Then, having bountifully fed the two survivors, we left\r\nthem to dispose of themselves as they would for the night, and retired\r\nto our cavern.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER FOURTEEN.\r\n\r\nMOKALUA AND VATI.\r\n\r\nWhen we turned out on the following morning our two resuscitated savages\r\nwere nowhere to be seen, and the bodies of the three dead had also\r\nvanished; but a glance in the direction of the beach showed that they\r\nwere still somewhere on the island, for their canoe lay hauled up on the\r\nsand, alongside the catamaran, where we had left her on the previous\r\nnight, and the prints of their naked feet on the sand indicated that\r\nthey had made some three or four journeys to the eastern extremity of\r\nthe bay.  We therefore concluded that the two were performing the\r\nobsequies of their departed companions, and made no endeavour to\r\ndiscover their whereabouts, taking it for granted that they would\r\nreappear when they had disposed of their dead to their satisfaction.\r\nWhile we were partaking of breakfast a big cloud of smoke arose from the\r\nwoods situated at the eastern extremity of the bay, causing us to\r\nsurmise that the dead were at that moment undergoing the process of\r\ncremation; but we made no attempt to investigate, leaving the savages to\r\ntheir own devices for that day, and proceeding to the shipyard as usual\r\nimmediately after breakfast.\r\n\r\nShortly after midday our two savages hove in sight, making their way\r\ndown the cliff path to the shipyard, having evidently followed the path\r\nover the plateau which we had beaten in our frequent passages to and fro\r\nbetween the two bays.  They displayed no fear of us, approaching us\r\nwithout the slightest hesitation, but exhibiting more curiosity than any\r\nnatives with whom I had thus far been brought into contact.  They seemed\r\nto be filled with astonishment at the whiteness of our skins when,\r\nfollowing our usual custom, we discarded our scanty clothing and plunged\r\ninto the sea for a few minutes before partaking of our midday meal; and\r\ndid not appear to be able to understand how it was that, while our\r\nfaces, necks, hands, and arms were almost as dark as their own skins,\r\nthe remaining portions of our bodies, ordinarily protected from the sun\r\nby our clothing, should be so very much lighter.  They were not\r\noppressed by any feeling of false modesty or bashfulness, but examined\r\nus minutely at close quarters, jabbering together with the utmost\r\nanimation all the while and lightly running their fingers over our arms\r\nand necks, with the apparent purpose of finding the join in the\r\ndifferently coloured portions of our skin.\r\n\r\nThis was all very well, of course, and sufficiently amusing to all\r\nconcerned; but now that these two savages had come to us we quite\r\nintended to make use of them, and allow them to work for their living.\r\nTherefore, as soon as we had resumed our clothing, Murdock undertook the\r\ntask of making known our intentions and wishes to our dusky friends.\r\nAnd the way he did it was amusing enough.  In common with others of his\r\nkind he had repeatedly been brought into contact with foreigners of\r\nvarious nationalities, both civilised and savage, but he had one simple\r\nmethod of communicating with them all, a method which he was firmly\r\nconvinced must be efficacious in exact proportion to the measure of\r\nintelligence possessed by the persons with whom he desired to\r\ncommunicate; and that method was to speak to the stranger in broken\r\nEnglish!  For example, he proposed to set these two natives to the task\r\nof collecting fuel for the purpose of cooking the fish which Chips and\r\nSails were about to catch for our midday meal by going offshore a short\r\ndistance in the catamaran; and the way he did it was something like\r\nthis.\r\n\r\nTurning to the two natives, he poked first one and then the other on the\r\nnaked chest with his forefinger, to secure their attention, and then\r\nproceeded to remark, with much flourishing of his hands:\r\n\r\n\"Now then, Johnnie, and you, Jim, come along wi' me and gather firewood.\r\nSavvy?\"\r\n\r\nTo this the natives naturally responded with a blank stare of\r\nnon-comprehension, gradually merging into a broad smile.  Then, seeing\r\nthat his first attempt had not been exactly a success, the boatswain\r\nproceeded upon his usual lines.  Assuming an aspect of intense\r\nearnestness, and holding his forefinger up before them, he continued:\r\n\r\n\"Now, lookee here, you coffee-coloured sweeps, me wantee you come alonga\r\nme and catchee plenty wood for makee fire cookee fis' that them two men\r\nare goin' for catchee.  Now, then, d'ye savvy that?\"\r\n\r\nThe intonation of his concluding words no doubt conveyed to the minds of\r\nhis hearers the idea that he was asking a question, for the two savages\r\nturned to each other and exchanged a few words.  Then the elder, with a\r\nbroad smile, pointed first to himself and uttered the word \"Mokalua\"--\r\nwhich we easily understood must be his name--and then to his companion,\r\npronouncing the word \"Vati\", which was as certainly the name of the\r\nother.  So evident was this that even Murdock understood it, and, proud\r\nof his quick comprehension, hastened to display his cleverness by\r\nprodding the first native in the chest and remarking:\r\n\r\n\"Ay, ay; that's easy enough to understand: your name's Mokalua, and\r\nyours,\"--turning to the other--\"is Vati.  That's all right; I can see\r\nthat we'll soon get to understand each other.  Now then, Mokalua and\r\nVati, let's have another try.  Me wantee plenty much firewood, so you\r\ntwo come and helpy me gatheree it.  Comprenny?\"\r\n\r\nFurther blank looks from the natives, at which the boatswain lost his\r\npatience; and, clutching Mokalua by the wrist, while he seized the\r\nunhappy Vati by the shoulder and violently swung him round with his face\r\ntoward the cliffs, he exclaimed savagely:\r\n\r\n\"Here, come along o' me, you two!  You're like the monkeys; you can\r\nunderstand, but you won't, for fear o' bein' put to work!  But you don't\r\nget over me quite so easily as that, my sons; I've had that trick tried\r\non me before, but it didn't come off, and it ain't comin' off now.\r\nYou've got to work for your livin' while you're on this here hisland,\r\nand don't you forget it.  Can't understand my language, can't ye?  Well,\r\nI can speak another language with my boot--\"\r\n\r\nI saw that the time had arrived for me to interfere.  Murdock was\r\nrapidly working himself up into a rage, and when he was angry he was a\r\nlittle apt to be violent; also he was an exceptionally powerful man,\r\nwhile the two natives whom he held in his grasp were still weak from\r\nsemi-starvation and long exposure, and were beginning to look rather\r\nfrightened.  Now I did not want them to be frightened, I wanted to win\r\ntheir confidence, so I stepped forward and gently removed the\r\nboatswain's grasp from the persons of his prisoners, saying:\r\n\r\n\"There, that will do, Murdock; don't get excited, man, because these two\r\nbronze images cannot understand you.  You cannot understand them, you\r\nknow, so you are quits.  We shall just have to be patient with them, and\r\ntreat them kindly; and I have no doubt that in due time they will learn\r\nto understand what we want them to do.\"  Then, turning to the two\r\nwide-eyed savages, and trusting that they would at least understand the\r\nintonation of my voice, I patted them both good-naturedly on the\r\nshoulder and said, in English of course:\r\n\r\n\"That's all right.  Don't you be afraid of him, he'll not hurt you; he's\r\nquite a good-natured chap.  But he wants you to go with him to the woods\r\nyonder; so run along,\" and I first pointed to the jungle, then to\r\nMurdock, patted them encouragingly on the back, and finally waved my\r\nhand toward the cliffs.\r\n\r\nThat I was tolerably successful in a general sort of way was at once\r\nevident, for the expression of mingled fear and savagery on Mokalua's\r\nfeatures at once vanished, giving place to a smile; he nodded his head,\r\npointed to Murdock, himself, and Vati, waved his hand toward the woods,\r\nsaid a few quick words to his companion, and at once set off at a brisk\r\nwalk toward the cliff path, accompanied by the two others, the trio\r\nreturning about twenty minutes later with an abundant supply of dry\r\ntwigs and branches, with which they at once proceeded to build the\r\nconstituents of a fire.  But it was evident, from their actions and\r\ntheir quick, earnest interchange of remarks, that the two were\r\nexceedingly curious as to how we were going to set light to the wood,\r\nnow that we had it; and they looked on with the most absorbed interest\r\nwhile Cunningham took a little dry moss in his hand and focused the\r\nsun's rays upon it with a burning-glass, afterwards fanning it into a\r\nflame by gently whirling it in the air; and I shall not readily forget\r\ntheir amazement when the moss burst into flame and Cunningham thrust it\r\ninto the heart of the heap of sticks.  When Cunningham made to return\r\nthe lens to his pocket, Mokalua held out his hand and said something\r\nwhich we readily understood to be a request that he might be permitted\r\nto look at it: and when the engineer handed it over to him the native\r\nfirst examined it with wondering eyes, turning it about in his hands,\r\nholding it up, and becoming quite eloquent in the expression of his\r\namazement when his quick eye detected the inverted image of the\r\nlandscape seen through it; then, after one or two futile attempts, he\r\nsucceeded in focusing the rays of the sun upon his naked arm, giving a\r\nlittle yelp as he felt the sting of the heat.  Finally, with a laugh, he\r\nhanded the lens back to Cunningham; but there was a covetous look in his\r\neyes as he did so which caused me to utter a word of warning to the\r\nengineer lest he should awake some fine morning and discover that his\r\nburning-glass had mysteriously vanished.\r\n\r\nIn such manner, and to the accompaniment of quite a number of amusing\r\nlittle incidents, did Mokalua and Vati become members of our small\r\ncommunity.  And glad enough were we all to have them, for the\r\nawkwardness and inconvenience arising from our inability to understand\r\neach other's speech soon passed away, the two savages manifesting an\r\nextraordinary aptitude to adapt themselves to the situation, and an\r\nequally extraordinary facility in the comprehension of what was required\r\nof them; so that they rapidly became of very material value to us,\r\ncatching more fish than the party could consume, gathering our firewood\r\nfor us, teaching us new methods of cooking, and assisting us in the more\r\nlaborious portions of our shipyard work.  Thus by the time they had been\r\nwith us some three or four months we began to wonder how we had ever\r\ncontrived to rub along at all without them.\r\n\r\nTheir one fault was an ineradicable propensity to steal anything and\r\neverything that they could lay their hands upon, especially nails--\r\nwhich, it will be understood, were of very considerable value to us,\r\nsituated as we then were.  But their most serious peccadillo, and the\r\none which had the most disastrous results, was their theft of a brace of\r\nrevolvers and a number of cartridges.  We had no occasion to make use of\r\nour firearms until the two savages had been with us about five months;\r\nthen on a certain day we made the disagreeable discovery that South-west\r\nBay had been invaded by a school of some seven or eight orcas, or killer\r\nwhales, the most voracious and ferocious creatures that swim the seas,\r\nbeing even more terrible than the white shark, although not quite so big\r\nas he is.  When we first became aware of the presence of these tigers of\r\nthe sea in our bay we were not greatly concerned, being under the\r\nimpression that theirs was only a flying visit, and that they would\r\ndisappear in the course of an hour or so, and be no more seen.  But when\r\non the following day they were seen to be still present, and when,\r\nfurther, they chose to amuse themselves by snatching the fish off the\r\nhooks, we came to the conclusion that it was time to declare war upon\r\nthose orcas, for so long as they remained in the bay we might not dare\r\nto bathe.\r\n\r\nAccordingly we armed ourselves with revolvers, put a boarding pike and\r\ncutlass into the hand of each of the savages, and went out in the\r\ncatamaran to attack and drive away the orcas.  And a very fierce and\r\ndesperate battle we had with them too, for they proved to be full of\r\nfight, charging the catamaran with the evident intention of destroying\r\nit; and during the two hours that the fight raged we experienced several\r\nexceedingly narrow escapes from destruction by the wounded cetaceans,\r\nthough we drove them off at last, after killing all but two, while the\r\nsurvivors were so desperately wounded that they no doubt died very\r\nshortly after reaching the open ocean.\r\n\r\nThe most important point, however, in connection with this incident was\r\nthat the two savages then saw revolvers used for the first time; and the\r\nflash, the report, and, above all, the undoubted fact that in some\r\nmysterious fashion they were able to wound and even to kill at the\r\ndistance of a spear-cast, absolutely fascinated them.  Nothing would\r\nsatisfy them but that they must possess a revolver apiece, and the very\r\nnext day they stole a brace, together with some fifty cartridges; and\r\nhaving watched us intently, and thus acquired a smattering of knowledge\r\nof how to use the weapons, took to the woods, where, later on, we heard\r\nthem popping away in the most reckless fashion.  That, of course, was an\r\noffence which it would never do to overlook; therefore we sallied forth,\r\ncaptured the culprits, took the revolvers and the half-dozen or so\r\nremaining cartridges from them, and having first read them a severe\r\nlecture--one of many such--upon the heinousness of stealing, endeavoured\r\nto create a lasting impression upon their minds by inflicting upon each\r\na severe rope's-ending.  Four days later we found that they and their\r\ncanoe, together with several small articles--Cunningham's burning-glass\r\namong the number--had vanished.\r\n\r\nNow this was likely enough to prove a very serious matter for us, for\r\nseveral important reasons.  In the first place, Mokalua and Vati had\r\nproved to be individuals possessed of quite a considerable amount of\r\nintelligence, for savages.  They had spent five months with us, during\r\nwhich they had come to know the island intimately; and doubtless they\r\nhad perceived, among other things, that it was capable of supporting\r\nsome five hundred fellow savages in what, to them, would be a condition\r\nof ease and affluence.  Also, they knew that there were but five of us,\r\npossessing several things which to them represented such incalculable\r\nwealth that no effort on their part to acquire it would be regarded as\r\ntoo great.  Therefore we at once jumped to the conclusion that, animated\r\nby a deep sense of resentment at the indignity which we had inflicted\r\nupon them by flogging them, and possibly also spurred on by an\r\noverpowering cupidity, they had determined to risk their very lives in\r\nan attempt to return to their own island, there to report all that they\r\nhad seen and learned during their sojourn with us, with the object of\r\nstirring up their fellow islanders to organise an expedition against us.\r\n\r\nStrongly impressed with the conviction that this was really what had\r\nhappened, Simpson, the sailmaker, and I hastened to stock the catamaran\r\nwith provisions and water enough to last us for four days, and forthwith\r\nproceeded to sea, heading in the direction of the island which lay to\r\nleeward of us, in the hope of overtaking the two savages before they\r\ncould arrive at their destination, and inducing them, either by\r\npersuasion or by force, to return with us.  And we were fully justified\r\nin hoping that we should be successful, for the catamaran was a\r\nwonderfully speedy craft, especially before the wind; we calculated that\r\nthe savages would scarcely average more than four knots per hour\r\npaddling in the open sea, even with the wind in their favour, while the\r\ncatamaran would do ten easily.  Consequently we should cover in ten\r\nhours a distance which they would need twenty-five hours to traverse;\r\nand, since they would probably not have more than nine hours' start of\r\nus, we ought to catch them long before they could arrive at their\r\nisland.\r\n\r\nIt was about eight o'clock in the morning when we started, and the\r\nmoment that we were clear of the reef I bore up dead before the wind;\r\nand thereafter all that was necessary was to keep the catamaran running\r\nstraight before it.  We took it for granted that the fugitives, like\r\nourselves, would avail themselves of the direction of the wind as a\r\nguide, consequently we assumed that they were somewhere--probably about\r\nthirty-six miles--directly ahead of us when we bore away, and a very\r\nsimple calculation enabled us to determine that, if all our data\r\nhappened to be correct, we ought to overtake the canoe about two o'clock\r\nin the afternoon.  Therefore for the first four hours of our pursuit we\r\ntroubled ourselves only to maintain as straight a course as possible.\r\nAt the end of that time, however, or about midday--by which time our own\r\nisland was out of sight astern, while the other had not yet hove up\r\nabove the horizon--I deemed it advisable to take a look round.\r\nAccordingly, turning over the steering paddle to Simpson, I shinned up\r\nto the catamaran's masthead, and remained there for fully five minutes,\r\nintently scrutinising the surface of the sea in every direction, my\r\nrange of vision at that elevation covering a circle of about nine miles\r\nradius.  But there was nothing in sight, at which I was in nowise\r\nsurprised, as I estimated that the canoe was still about twelve miles\r\nahead of us.  I calculated, however, that we were gaining upon her at\r\nthe rate of about six miles an hour, in which case she ought to be on\r\nthe horizon's verge in the course of another half-hour; therefore at the\r\nexpiration of that time I again went aloft, and was just a trifle\r\ndisappointed to find the horizon still bare.  However, I was quite\r\ncertain that a run of another half-hour would suffice to bring her into\r\nview, therefore at one o'clock I again ascended to the masthead, quite\r\nprepared to see her directly ahead.  But again I was disappointed, for\r\nthe horizon was bare in every direction, save for the fact that, as\r\nstraight ahead of us as though we had seen and been steering for it all\r\nthe while, there was a delicate blue shape, which I instantly recognised\r\nas the upper part of the island that we had seen from the lip of the\r\ncrater on our own island.\r\n\r\nI was decidedly nonplussed at the fact that the fugitives were still\r\ninvisible, and knew not how to account for it.  True, the sea was a\r\ntrifle heavy for navigation in so frail a craft as a small canoe, yet\r\nthe two savages were experts in the handling of such craft, and it was\r\ntherefore scarcely likely that they had met with a mishap of any\r\ndescription--indeed, all that was needed to ensure their perfect safety\r\nwas to keep the canoe dead before the sea, and she would go along\r\nwithout shipping a drop of water; even I, comparatively inexpert as I\r\nwas, would not have hesitated to undertake such a voyage, under the\r\ninfluence of so powerful an inducement as that which we suspected to\r\nanimate the two natives.  There was one other possible explanation, of\r\nwhich I thought as I stood up there on the swaying yard, and that was\r\nthat the fugitives might have secured a piece of canvas, or material of\r\nsome kind, out of which they had manufactured a sail; in which case\r\ntheir speed would no doubt be considerably higher than that which we had\r\nestimated, and all our calculations would need revision.  Considerably\r\nperturbed at the thought, I descended to the deck and mentioned the\r\nmatter to Simpson, who agreed with me that it was quite possible our\r\ndark friends might have taken the precaution to provide themselves with\r\na sail when they had made up their minds to return to their own island--\r\nfor we had not allowed ourselves time before our departure to overhaul\r\nour belongings in detail, and ascertain the precise extent of their\r\ndepredations.\r\n\r\nEven if they had not stolen any of our canvas, they were past masters of\r\nthe art of mat making, and might easily have plaited for themselves a\r\nsail of fine grass, which would answer their purpose almost as well as\r\none made of canvas.  And if they had done that, what would their speed\r\nprobably be?  The canoe was only a small craft of about twenty-four feet\r\nlong by about four feet beam, and with two men in her she would probably\r\nrun before wind and sea at a speed of about six and a half knots.  Then,\r\nstill allowing her to have had nine hours' start of us, we came to the\r\ndisconcerting conclusion that at the precise moment when we were\r\ndiscussing the question she must be within ten miles of her destination,\r\nwhile we still had a run of some fifty miles before us.  In that case,\r\nof course, it was hopeless for us to dream of overtaking her:\r\nnevertheless I did not intend to abandon the chase until I had fully\r\nsatisfied myself that the fugitives had made good their escape;\r\ntherefore we continued to stand on, hour after hour, until, by the time\r\nthat the sun was within half an hour of his setting, we had brought the\r\nstrange island \"hull-up\" on the horizon ahead, and had satisfied\r\nourselves that there was no canoe between it and us.\r\n\r\nIt was a considerably more extensive island than our own, being about\r\ntwenty miles long from north to south, somewhat rugged of surface, with\r\nplenty of trees dotted about here and there, and wide patches of cleared\r\nground in between, upon which crops of various kinds seemed to be\r\ngrowing.  It rose rather steeply from the water's surface to a height of\r\nsome fifty or sixty feet, and then went sweeping grandly away to right\r\nand left in a constantly steepening slope, which culminated in a lofty,\r\nisolated peak occupying practically the centre of the island.\r\n\r\nWhen we had run in close enough to note all these details I brought the\r\nwind over the catamaran's port quarter and headed her so as to pass to\r\nthe southward of the island, being determined, now that I had come so\r\nfar, to sail right round it and see as much as I could of it.\r\n\r\nThe sun was just dipping beneath the horizon when, having brought the\r\nmost southerly extremity of the island square upon our starboard beam,\r\nsome two miles distant, we shifted our helm, and, jibing over, brought\r\nthe wind on our starboard quarter, hauling up to the northward and\r\nwestward to skirt the lee side of the island.  This course soon brought\r\nus in under the lee of the land and into smooth water, when, maintaining\r\nan offing of about two miles, that we might not be becalmed and so\r\ninvite the risk of capture by a dash of canoes from the shore, we\r\nquietly coasted along the lee side of the island, which we now\r\ndiscovered to be roughly crescent-shaped in plan, with a deep\r\nindentation on the west side protected by a barrier reef, and thus\r\nforming a magnificent natural harbour, some eight miles long from north\r\nto south by about six miles wide from east to west.  A fine sandy beach\r\nskirted the whole margin of this indentation, scattered along which, at\r\nbrief intervals, we caught sight of some ten or twelve little villages\r\nof palm-leaf huts nestling in the midst of luxuriant coconut groves, the\r\nland behind them soaring steeply away to the summit of the cone.  And\r\nabreast of each village the beach was dotted with canoes, some of which\r\nwere big enough to carry forty or fifty men.  But nowhere did we see a\r\nsign of the canoe of which we were in pursuit; and ultimately we were\r\ndriven to the conclusion that she had made the run across under sail,\r\nand had secured a sufficiently long start to enable her to make good her\r\nescape.\r\n\r\nIt was about four bells in the first watch when we ran out from under\r\nthe lee of the island and once more felt the full strength of the Trade\r\nwind, which in the interim had freshened up until it was now blowing a\r\nsingle-reefed topsail breeze; and at once the catamaran began to deluge\r\nus with spray as we brought her close to the wind and started on our\r\nlong beat back to our own island.  And now it became necessary for me to\r\nuse a little discretion, lest I should miss the island altogether; for\r\nit was far below the horizon, and I had neither chronometer nor sextant\r\nto help me to find it again, all I knew as to its position being that it\r\nlay about a hundred miles dead to windward.  Therefore I held on upon\r\nthe starboard tack until midnight, and thereafter tacked every four\r\nhours, knowing that by following this plan we should be certain to pick\r\nit up sooner or later.  And so we did, catching our first glimpse of it\r\nshortly after nine o'clock the next morning, when it hove into view\r\nabove the horizon broad on our port bow, rising a little higher as we\r\nbrought it abeam, and then gradually sinking again as it swung aft to\r\nour port quarter.  As soon as it sank out of sight we hove the catamaran\r\nabout, when it quickly reappeared, rising steadily above the horizon,\r\nand this time showing much higher and more clearly before it began to\r\nsink again.  Finally, about six o'clock, just before sunset, we slid\r\ninto North Bay once more and beached the catamaran, much to the relief\r\nof our companions, who were beginning to grow somewhat anxious as to how\r\nour queer-shaped craft would stand the continuous strain of beating to\r\nwindward for many hours at a stretch against the strong wind and heavy\r\nsea.\r\n\r\nNow that the pursuit was over and had failed, and we were all together\r\nagain, we began to realise, as we discussed the incident, just what the\r\nflight of those two natives meant to us.  It meant several things: and\r\neach one of them spelt d-a-n-g-e-r to us in big black letters; danger of\r\nthe most imminent and deadly kind; danger which was liable now to swoop\r\ndown upon us at any moment, and, if it caught us unprepared, simply to\r\nwipe us out of existence.  In a word, it meant that if those two\r\nfugitives had succeeded in reaching their own island--as we had only too\r\nmuch reason to believe was the case--we were liable at any moment to an\r\ninvasion in force from their fellow islanders; and if we could not repel\r\nthat invasion, or, better still, effect our own escape before it\r\nhappened, we could hope for nothing short of annihilation.  Long and\r\nanxiously we discussed the question that night; and the decision at\r\nwhich we finally arrived was that if Mokalua and Vati had indeed reached\r\ntheir own island it would probably take them at least a week to gain the\r\near of the chiefs, tell the story of their own sojourn with us, and stir\r\nthem up to such a condition of cupidity as would induce them to\r\nundertake an expedition against us.  And when they had accomplished so\r\nmuch it would probably take them another week to organise the expedition\r\nand get across to us, possibly even longer, if the Trade wind continued\r\nto blow strongly.  We considered, therefore, that we had about a\r\nfortnight in which to complete our preparations; and the question then\r\narose whether these preparations should be of a defensive character, or\r\nwhether, by working hard, we could complete the schooner, ballast her,\r\nget her into the water, and leave the island before the expected\r\ninvasion took place.\r\n\r\nCommon sense pointed to the latter alternative as by far the wiser of\r\nthe two; the only difficulty was that we were by no means sure that we\r\ncould accomplish it.  Fortunately for us, although we had put the most\r\nimplicit faith in the fidelity of Mokalua and Vati, we had never allowed\r\nthem to become aware of the existence of the subterranean passage from\r\nour dwelling cave to South-west Bay: therefore, if the worst should come\r\nto the worst, and we were attacked before we were ready to leave the\r\nisland, we might no doubt barricade ourselves into our cavern and make a\r\ngood stand there, and perhaps even defend the schooner from destruction,\r\nso long as our cartridges held out; but if the invaders should once\r\nsucceed in effecting a landing upon the island, they could, almost to a\r\ndead certainty, prevent us from completing our preparations, launching\r\nthe schooner, and getting away in her.  Finally, the matter seemed to\r\nresolve itself into a fight against time, our aim being to complete the\r\nschooner and sail in her for home before the savages should arrive upon\r\nthe scene.  In accordance with this arrangement, then, we proceeded with\r\nour several labours, commencing work each day the moment that there was\r\nlight enough to see what we were about, and working steadily on until we\r\ncould see no longer, encouraged by the thought that although our\r\ncalculations seemed to indicate the possibility of attack within about a\r\nfortnight of the flight of the two natives, the force of circumstances\r\nmight perhaps afford us a still longer time in which to complete our\r\ntask.\r\n\r\nAnd with the passage of the days we began to realise that, work as hard\r\nas we might, we should need nearly double the time which we believed we\r\nhad at our disposal if we were to finish our work as it ought to be\r\nfinished.  For while the schooner's hull was complete her deck was only\r\npartially laid, and that task had to be completed, together with all\r\ndeck fittings, such as the companion way and fore scuttle; the seams\r\nmust be properly caulked and paid, the masts stepped and rigged, the\r\nsails finished and bent, the interior fittings, such as bunks, lockers,\r\nshelves, and so on, fixed, the water casks stowed and filled, the\r\nballast stowed, provisions collected and put on board, and the little\r\ncraft generally completed in readiness for sea.  True, many of the jobs\r\nwere trivial and did not need much time to attend to them, but in the\r\naggregate they presented quite a formidable appearance; and lastly, and\r\nmost formidable of all, there remained the launching ways to finish, the\r\ncradle to build, and the wedging up to be done.  Taken altogether, the\r\ntask seemed to be an impossible one, and our only hope lay in the chance\r\nthat our savage neighbours would so far resemble Mokalua and Vati in\r\ncharacter that they would proceed with their preparations for the\r\ninvasion which we regarded as inevitable with the same placid\r\ndeliberation and absence of haste that had been such strongly marked\r\ncharacteristics of the two fugitives.\r\n\r\nYet it would not do to count upon this; therefore as soon as we fully\r\nrealised the impossibility of completing the schooner and getting away\r\nin her within the fortnight, we so far modified our plans as to devote a\r\ncertain amount of time to the putting of our cavern into a condition of\r\ndefence.  Fortunately for us, this was a very simple matter; for the\r\nsavages knew of only one entrance to the cavern, namely, that in North\r\nBay, and that was so exceedingly small that it might easily be blocked\r\nfrom the inside with a few large stones.  And, as luck would have it,\r\nstones admirably adapted for the purpose existed in the cavern itself,\r\nand only needed moving forward close to the entrance, after which--as we\r\ntested by experiments--five minutes' work would suffice to block the\r\nopening so effectually that nothing less than a powder charge would ever\r\nclear it.  Accordingly we divided our weapons and ammunition into two\r\nequal parts, one of which parts we put aboard the schooner, while the\r\nother we deposited in the mouth of our cavern.  Then, having secured\r\nourselves as far as was possible against attack, we returned to our work\r\nupon the schooner with redoubled energy.\r\n\r\nDawn of the twenty-third day after the flight of Mokalua and Vati found\r\nus in high feather; for the strenuous labour of the preceding three\r\nweeks had brought us to the point that a few hours' further work would\r\nsee the completion of our task, the further work required being that\r\nneeded to finish the cradle and wedge up, preparatory to launching.  We\r\nhad been working systematically, attending first to those matters which\r\nwere most urgent, with the result that the schooner was now finished and\r\nready for sea, with ballast--consisting entirely of as much gold in\r\nnuggets as Cunningham's calculations showed she could possibly carry--\r\nproperly stowed, the water casks stowed and filled, provisions on board,\r\nmasts stepped and rigged, sails bent--in short, everything completed\r\nexcept the fitting and equipment of the cabin, and that, we decided,\r\ncould be done as easily after our little ship had been launched as while\r\nshe remained on the stocks.  On this particular morning, then, we were,\r\nas I have said, all in high feather, for we awoke with the comfortable\r\nassurance that, barring accidents, the schooner would be safely afloat\r\nbefore we again lay down to rest.\r\n\r\nNow, although we had been working so strenuously during the past three\r\nweeks, we had not omitted to take proper precautions against a surprise\r\non the part of the natives, the most important of these precautions\r\nconsisting in the visit of one of us to the summit of the crater the\r\nfirst thing every morning, from which commanding elevation the sea to\r\nthe south-west was carefully scanned, with the aid of Cunningham's\r\ntelescope, in search of the expected flotilla of canoes.  The same\r\nprecaution was observed the last thing before nightfall; and we decided\r\nthat, should the sea prove to be clear on these occasions, there was not\r\nmuch risk of our being surprised during either of the intervals between.\r\n\r\nOn the particular morning before referred to it chanced to be my turn to\r\nmake the journey up the mountain; therefore, taking the telescope in its\r\ncase from the rock projection in the cavern which was its recognised\r\nresting-place, and bidding my companions au revoir, I started out on my\r\nthree-and-a-half mile walk to the summit, while the others hurried down\r\nto the beach, and, getting aboard the catamaran, made sail for\r\nSouth-west Bay, where our shipyard was situated.\r\n\r\nNow the whole distance from our cavern to the summit of the crater was\r\nuphill, and the day, in addition to being brilliantly fine, was\r\nexcessively hot, for the Trade wind had softened down on the preceding\r\nday, and was now blowing only a very moderate breeze; therefore I did\r\nnot greatly hurry myself, for my way lay, practically for the whole\r\ndistance to the foot of the crater, through jungle, where, although I\r\nwas sheltered to a great extent from the rays of the sun, I was also\r\nshielded from the wind, and before I had travelled a mile I was\r\nperspiring profusely.  But, hot as it was while walking through the\r\njungle, it was hotter still when at length I emerged from its shelter\r\nupon the bare hillside; and I had no sooner climbed above the level of\r\nthe vegetation, and was able to look over the top of it, than I flung\r\nmyself down upon a big block of lava, took off my hat, and proceeded to\r\nwipe away the perspiration which was by this time streaming down my\r\nforehead into my eyes and half-blinding me.  And it was while I was thus\r\nengaged that I happened to allow my gaze to wander away out over the\r\nsurface of the water in a south-westerly direction; and then I saw a\r\nsight which caused me to spring to my feet with a smothered exclamation.\r\nFor, far out upon the sun-flecked blue of the gently ruffled ocean, I\r\ncaught a glimpse of first one and then another and another small dark\r\ndot, each of which emitted frequent sparkling flashes which I instantly\r\nidentified as the sunlight striking upon the wet blades of swiftly\r\nwielded paddles.  With anxious haste I gripped the telescope case, swung\r\nit round, withdrew the telescope, raised it to my eyes, and focused it;\r\nand there, magnified into unmistakable distinctness by the powerful\r\nlenses, I saw no less than ten canoes paddling straight for our island,\r\nand only some eight miles distant from West Point, as we had named the\r\nheadland which projected into the ocean between North and South-west\r\nBays.  They were head-on to me, therefore I could not very well judge\r\nwhat size they might be; but I knew that they must be fairly big craft,\r\neach carrying a considerable number of men, judging by the multitudinous\r\nnumber of flashes that sparkled from their paddles as they swung\r\nrhythmically into and out of the water: and they were all keeping line\r\ntoo, for the whole ten swung up into view together on the crest of a\r\nsea, and then disappeared again in the trough, with almost mathematical\r\nregularity and precision.  Without a doubt the anticipated invasion of\r\nour island by the savages was about to take place; and, equally without\r\na doubt too, the invaders must gain a footing upon our territory before\r\nwe were prepared to quit it, unless a plan could be devised whereby\r\ntheir advance might be delayed for some two or three hours.  As these\r\nthoughts flashed through my mind I anxiously scanned the surface of the\r\nocean for other canoes, but could find only the ten which I had\r\noriginally counted.  Then, without wasting time in ascending to the\r\nsummit of the crater, I set off at a run and raced at my utmost speed\r\nall the way back to our cavern.\r\n\r\nIt was downhill all the way, and despite the intense heat I do not think\r\nI was more than twenty minutes in covering the distance.  Once inside\r\nthe cavern I provided myself with a sufficient number of torches for my\r\npurpose, lighted half a dozen of them to enable me to see what I was\r\nabout, and then proceeded to block the entrance securely from the inside\r\nwith the stones which we had already provided for that express purpose.\r\nThis done, I opened the case of ammunition which we kept stored in the\r\ncavern, loaded a gun and a brace of revolvers, thrust the latter in my\r\nbelt, crammed my pockets and the bosom of my shirt with cartridges, and,\r\nseizing a torch, hurried away through the tunnel to the shipyard in\r\nSouth-west Bay, where I found my companions strenuously at work upon the\r\ncompletion of the cradle, blissfully ignorant of the fact that the\r\nsavages were at that moment within half a dozen miles of us.\r\n\r\nThey glanced at me with a somewhat startled expression as I dashed down\r\nthe beach toward them with the gun in my hand and the revolvers in my\r\nbelt, and my face streaming with perspiration; and Cunningham shouted:\r\n\r\n\"Hillo, old chap, you're hot, and look as though you had been hurrying.\r\nWhat's up?  You surely don't mean to say that--\"\r\n\r\n\"The savages are coming?\"  I interrupted.  \"That's just what I do mean\r\nto say, then.  They are within half a dozen miles of us at this moment--\r\nten big canoe-loads of them, and they'll be ashore here and about our\r\nears in two hours from now, unless we can devise some means of\r\npreventing them.  How are you getting on, Chips?  How long will it be\r\nbefore you are ready to wedge up?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not for three or four hours yet, I'm afraid,\" answered the carpenter,\r\npausing in his work to consider the matter.  \"You see, we've a good deal\r\nto do yet afore we can finish this here cradle, and the wood, bein'\r\nnothin' but odds and ends like, is comin' a bit awk'ard--\"\r\n\r\n\"Just so, I quite understand,\" I cut in upon his explanation.  \"Well,\r\ncarry on, man; don't stop an instant; we can't afford to waste so much\r\nas a single second just now.  Do the best you can with the resources at\r\nyour command, and work as you never worked before.  As for me, I'm going\r\nto take out the catamaran to meet those beggars, and see if I can't\r\nhamper them a bit and prevent them from landing here in this bay.  I've\r\nblocked the cavern entrance at the other end, so it won't matter much\r\nwhere they land so long as they don't come ashore here.  That must be\r\nprevented at all costs.  I shall want one hand with me to sail the\r\ncatamaran while I do the fighting.  Now, who can best be spared?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, I think I am the most useless member of the party--\" began\r\nCunningham.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" I interrupted him emphatically; \"your engineering knowledge should\r\ncome in very usefully in helping Chips to use up those odds and ends of\r\ntimber to the best advantage in completing the cradle.  You are the man\r\nfor me, Simpson, so jump now.  Get aboard the schooner, open a box of\r\nammunition, and bring me as many cartridges as you can carry, also\r\nanother gun, in case anything goes wrong with this one.  Then join me\r\naboard the catamaran.  And now, so long, you chaps; I'm off.  Do your\r\nlevel best to finish off and wedge up as soon as possible; and I'll do\r\nwhat I can to hinder the savages and keep them from landing here.\r\nGoodbye!\" and, so saying, I turned and ran toward the spot where the\r\ncatamaran lay with her bows hauled up on the beach.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER FIFTEEN.\r\n\r\nWE ESCAPE BY THE SKIN OF OUR TEETH.\r\n\r\nIn a few minutes Sails joined me, with the extra gun and a biscuit tin\r\nfull of cartridges; and between us we got the catamaran afloat, swung\r\nher round with her bows pointing seaward, and both jumped aboard.  Then,\r\nwhile I seized the steering paddle, Simpson sprang to the main halyards\r\nand hoisted the big lateen sail, which at once filled, when we gathered\r\nheadway and began to draw away from the shore, heading about south-west\r\nout of the bay; and as soon as the sail was fully set and the halyards\r\nbelayed, Sails came aft and took the helm, while I gave the spare gun an\r\noverhaul before loading it.\r\n\r\nAs we drew out from under the lee of the island and began to feel the\r\ntrue breeze it became apparent that it was fast freshening up again, for\r\nwe could see the heads of the seas bursting into little patches of white\r\nfroth here and there, at which I was profoundly grateful; for I felt\r\nthat a fresh breeze, dead in their teeth, was likely to hamper the\r\nprogress of the savages quite as much as I could hope to do, and every\r\nminute of delay now was worth a gold mine to us.  And that the advance\r\nof the savages was indeed being retarded by the rapidly freshening\r\nbreeze soon became apparent, for we were fully three miles offshore when\r\nwe at length made out the canoes, about two miles to leeward of us,\r\nheading straight in for the island.\r\n\r\nRunning rapidly down toward them, we soon neared them sufficiently to\r\nenable us to see that they were big, lumping craft, about sixty feet\r\nlong by six or seven feet beam, each canoe being manned by about fifty\r\nsavages, every mother's son of whom was wielding a short, broad-bladed\r\npaddle as though his life depended upon it.  Yet the canoes were not\r\nmaking very much headway, for they were unwieldy--looking craft, with\r\nlong, high-peaked, overhanging bows, and sterns which seemed to catch\r\nand hold a good deal of wind, making the paddling of them to windward,\r\nespecially against a heavy head sea, exceedingly hard work.\r\n\r\nTo do anything really effective with these craft, and especially to make\r\ngood shooting in the heavy sea that was running, it was necessary to get\r\nto close quarters with them; I therefore directed Simpson to haul up two\r\nor three points to the northward, my intention being to pass the\r\nflotilla on their port beam, come to the wind as soon as we had passed\r\nthem, cross their sterns, raking them as we passed, and then follow\r\nthem, maintaining a steady fire all the way, and crowding them up to the\r\nnorthward as much as possible, so that they might not land in South-west\r\nBay.\r\n\r\nOur approach was greeted with yells of defiance from the crowded canoes,\r\nmany of the occupants of which dropped their paddles, sprang to their\r\nfeet, and hurled their long spears at us as we swept past them at a\r\ndistance of some two hundred yards from the nearest canoe.  They were\r\nexperts in the hurling of spears, those savages; but it was no part of\r\nmy plan to run the risk of getting either Simpson or myself hurt--two of\r\nus against some five hundred left no room for quixotic displays of\r\ndaring; and we were careful to keep beyond the range of their spears,\r\nevery one of which dropped harmlessly into the water at varying\r\ndistances from us, the nearest of them all falling short by about thirty\r\nor forty fathoms.  But if I was anxious that neither of us should be\r\nhurt, I was also anxious to avoid hurting the savages, as far as might\r\nbe, my object being not so much to destroy them as to prevent them from\r\nlanding on our island, if possible; and I thought that this might\r\nperhaps be done, and the savages compelled to retreat, by drilling their\r\ncanoes so full of bullet holes that at least some of them would sink,\r\nwhen the remainder would become so crowded that it would be found\r\nimpossible to continue paddling to windward--for I took it for granted\r\nthat if one or two of their canoes sank, their crews would be picked up\r\nby the rest.  Of course there was the risk that, in endeavouring to sink\r\ntheir canoes, I might wound or even kill a few savages; but that was\r\ntheir lookout, not mine.\r\n\r\nTherefore, when our antagonists opened the ball by casting spears at us,\r\nI retaliated by seizing my gun and aiming at the water line of the\r\nnearest canoe, expecting the bullet to pass right through her, leaving\r\ntwo holes which would admit quite a quantity of water, unless the\r\nsavages happened to possess the means to plug them.  My shot went true,\r\nfor as the smoke blew away I saw a small white puncture show in the\r\nbottom of the canoe for an instant before it was hidden by the roll of\r\nthe craft.  A loud yell of astonishment greeted my first essay, showing\r\nthat these particular savages had never before had experience of\r\nfirearms; but the yell was not wholly the result of astonishment either,\r\nfor I saw a native clap his hand to his leg, and shrewdly guessed that\r\nthe bullet had punctured him as well as the canoe.  I had time to drop\r\nthe discharged gun, seize the loaded one, and fire a second shot before\r\nwe were fairly past that particular craft; but that second shot was less\r\nsuccessful than the first, for it missed the canoe.  However, it caught\r\na native, who sprang convulsively to his feet, his hands clutching his\r\nhead, as, wheeling half-round, he staggered backward and tumbled head\r\nover heels into the sea.  I naturally expected that his friends would\r\nstop and endeavour to pick him up, but not a bit of it; they merely\r\nuttered another yell, apparently of encouragement to each other, and\r\ndrove their paddles into the water with increased energy.\r\n\r\nBoth guns being now empty, I signed Simpson to come to the wind and luff\r\nathwart the sterns of the flotilla, while I busied myself upon the\r\nrecharging of the pieces.  By the time that this was done we were on the\r\nstarboard quarter of the most southerly of the canoes, and I immediately\r\nproceeded to test my skill upon her.  Making short tacks across her\r\nstern, I fired half a dozen bullets into her, every one of which hit,\r\nfive out of the six wounding and disabling one or more of her occupants\r\nas well as drilling a hole in the canoe herself, with the result that\r\nshe began to drop astern of the others, the crews of which were exerting\r\nthemselves to their very utmost, having apparently come to the\r\nconclusion that the sooner they could reach the island the better it\r\nwould be for them.  Wherefore I attacked the next canoe in like manner:\r\nbut now I was less careful than before in the matter of hurting her\r\noccupants, for it began to dawn upon me that these savages had no notion\r\nof standing by to help a disabled consort, and that, do what I would, I\r\ncould not possibly prevent some of them at least from effecting a\r\nlanding; therefore my business must be to see that as few of them as\r\npossible should set foot on the island.  Incidentally, I found that by\r\npersistently attacking the southernmost canoe I was slowly but surely\r\neffecting one part of my purpose, by causing the whole flotilla to edge\r\nslowly away to the northward, thus diverting them from any purpose that\r\nthey might have had of landing in South-west Bay.\r\n\r\nThen another plan suggested itself to me.  I saw that the savages were\r\neither destitute of means to plug the bullet holes in their canoes or\r\nhad not wit enough to make use of them; but each canoe appeared to carry\r\nseveral large calabash bowls, which were used as balers: my plan,\r\ntherefore, was to shoot promptly at any man whom I saw attempting to\r\nbale a leaky canoe, with the result that the particular canoe which I\r\nhappened to be attacking gradually filled and ultimately swamped,\r\nleaving her crew to cling helplessly to her as she floated full to her\r\ngunwale, or to strike out for the island, now some three miles distant.\r\nAnd since the fellows swam like seals there was no doubt that they would\r\nultimately reach it--unless a shark happened to encounter them on the\r\nway; but I did not allow the probability of their ultimate arrival on\r\nthe island to worry me much, for I felt tolerably certain that, before\r\nthat could happen, we should have made good our escape, if indeed we\r\nwere going to escape at all.\r\n\r\nOur effective antagonists were now reduced to eight canoes and their\r\ncrews, who were all hanging together as much as possible for mutual\r\nprotection, but were making poor headway against the steadily increasing\r\nwind and sea.  If I could hinder them still further, so much the better;\r\nand the most obvious way to do that was to weaken their crews by\r\nwounding as many as possible: therefore I now resumed my original\r\ntactics of tacking to and fro athwart their sterns, and raking them as\r\nwe passed.  And this, I soon found, was a very excellent plan, for it\r\nnot infrequently happened that by this mode of attack I was able to make\r\none bullet do double, and in some cases even treble duty; the result\r\nbeing that by the time that we all drew up abreast of the island the\r\nentire fleet was in such difficulties that they were scarcely able to\r\nmake any headway at all, two of the canoes indeed being so seriously\r\ncrippled that at last, notwithstanding their close proximity to the\r\nisland, they were actually compelled to bear up and run away to leeward\r\nagain, while another of them was swamped, leaving five out of the\r\noriginal ten still to contend with.\r\n\r\nAnd now my trouble began in earnest, for so desperate were the savages\r\nrendered by the merciless persecution to which they had compelled me, in\r\nself-defence, to subject them, that they made the most strenuous efforts\r\nto get into South-west Bay; and, indeed, it was not until I bore up and\r\ntook the extreme risk of running down one canoe that I was finally able\r\nto turn them from their purpose.  But ultimately, after a running\r\nfight--if so one-sided an affair could be so called--four of them\r\ncontrived to weather North-west Cape and effect a landing in North Bay.\r\nThen, after chasing them right into the bay, and keeping up a brisk fire\r\nupon them until they landed, to the number of about one hundred and\r\ntwenty, and vanished into the woods, we in the catamaran bore up, headed\r\nout to sea again, and made the best of our way back to South-west Bay\r\nand the shipyard, hoping that upon our arrival we should find the\r\nschooner afloat; for we had been gone fully four hours.\r\n\r\nBut to my intense disappointment, when we entered the bay there was the\r\nschooner still high and dry upon the stocks, with Chips, the boatswain,\r\nand Cunningham all busily engaged in turning over the small pile of\r\nlumber that still remained from the dismembered wreck of the _Martha_.\r\nPresently one of them looked up, saw us coming, and apparently reported\r\nthe fact to the others, for Cunningham at once straightened himself up\r\nand came down to the water's edge to meet us.\r\n\r\n\"Well, Temple,\" he exclaimed, as the catamaran grounded and I stepped\r\nashore, \"how have things gone with you?  Have you managed to beat off\r\nour friends the enemy?\"\r\n\r\n\"I have not,\" I answered, just a trifle sourly, I am afraid.  \"A hundred\r\nor more of them have landed round there in North Bay; and we may\r\nconfidently expect a visit from them within the next half-hour.  But\r\nwhat the mischief have you fellows been up to all this time?  I fully\r\nexpected to find the schooner afloat, under way, and only awaiting our\r\nreturn to be off!  What have you been doing?  Playing poker, or what?\"\r\n\r\n\"Now, my dear chap, don't you go and turn rusty as well as the rest of\r\nus, or there's no knowing what may happen; for, let me tell you, we're\r\nall just as savage as bears with sore heads,\" remonstrated Cunningham.\r\n\"No,\" he continued, \"we've not been playing poker, or hunt the slipper,\r\nor even kiss in the ring; to put it plainly, we've been trying to do the\r\nimpossible.  The long and the short of it is, Temple, that we have used\r\nup our last scrap of available timber, and there still remains a good\r\nhalf-hour's work to be done on the cradle before we dare start to wedge\r\nup.  We have been nailing and plugging bits together, and working them\r\nin to the best of our ability, until our last nail is expended; and now\r\nwe seem to be at a standstill.  I'll be shot if I know how we're going\r\nto get over the difficulty.\"\r\n\r\n\"What! do you mean to tell me that after getting as far as that we are\r\nbrought to a standstill for the sake of a few pieces of timber?\"  I\r\ndemanded.  \"How much do you require?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, very little,\" was the answer.  \"A few feet--ten or fifteen feet of\r\nthree-inch stuff would serve--but the mischief of it is that we haven't\r\ngot it.  Even the remains of the wreck will not yield us another inch.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then,\" said I, \"all that remains is to break into the catamaran, and\r\ntake out of her as much as is required.  She has served her turn; we\r\nshall not require her any more if we can get the schooner into the\r\nwater; and--\"\r\n\r\n\"Kick me; kick me hard!\" shouted Cunningham in an ecstasy of delight, as\r\nhe smote me a blow between the shoulders that made me stagger.  \"The\r\ncatamaran!\" he continued.  \"Of course.  Oh, what a lot of fools we were\r\nnot to have thought of that before!  But,\" suddenly bethinking himself,\r\n\"if we had, it would have been of no use, for you had her.  She is\r\navailable now, however, and in ten minutes we'll rip enough stuff out of\r\nher to finish our job.  I know exactly where to find the kind of stuff\r\nwe want.  Chips ahoy! bring your tools down to the catamaran, my son;\r\nwe're going to break her up!\"\r\n\r\nThe carpenter flung his hand aloft in joyous intimation that he\r\nunderstood, and at once made a dash for his tools, while Simpson and I\r\nwended our way to the schooner, to see how things looked in that\r\ndirection, and also to forage for a morsel of food, for we had eaten\r\nnothing since breakfast, and were feeling pretty hungry.\r\n\r\nA single glance at the cradle, which, when wedged up, would lift the\r\nschooner off the keel blocks and throw her weight upon the launching\r\nways, sufficed to reveal the pitiful straits to which Chips had latterly\r\nbeen reduced; for worked into it there were scraps of wood less than a\r\nfoot in length, fastened to other pieces of similar size with nails or\r\nplugs, and presenting a most flimsy and unsatisfactory appearance.  But\r\nwhen I came to look more closely I saw that the only unsatisfactory part\r\nof the work was its appearance; it was not nearly so flimsy as at first\r\nsight it had appeared to be.  Chips had evidently fully realised his\r\nresponsibility, and had taken care that, let the material be what it\r\nmight, there should be nothing faulty about his workmanship.  And I saw\r\nalso that, given the necessary amount of material, he would be able to\r\nfinish his work in a very short time.\r\n\r\nThe boatswain routed out some food for us, and while Simpson and I sat\r\ndown to eat and drink, Murdock, upon my instructions, went down to the\r\ncatamaran--which the carpenter and Cunningham had already attacked--and\r\nbrought away from her the two guns and the ammunition that remained from\r\nour engagement with the savages.  And when he had performed this errand\r\nI bade him get aboard the schooner, rout out a few extra guns and a\r\nfurther supply of ammunition, load the weapons, and then station himself\r\nin the bows as a lookout, with special instructions to keep a wary eye\r\nupon the neighbouring cliffs and report the very first indication of the\r\napproach of an enemy.\r\n\r\nThe boatswain had scarcely been on the lookout a matter of twenty\r\nminutes when he hailed me.\r\n\r\n\"Mr Temple,\" he shouted, \"I wish you'd come up here, sir, for a minute,\r\nand bring that there glass of Mr Cunnin'ham's along with ye.  There's\r\nsome'at up there on top o' them cliffs that I can't rightly make out,\r\nand I'd like you to come and have a look at it.\"\r\n\r\nAccordingly up I went, with Cunningham's telescope still slung over my\r\nshoulders, and joined Murdock where he stood right in the eyes of the\r\nschooner, peering intently at a particular spot on the top of the\r\ncliffs.\r\n\r\n\"Now then,\" said I, withdrawing the telescope from its case, \"where is\r\nthis mysterious something that you can't make out?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ye see that there big tree with the thick, knobbly-lookin' trunk, up\r\nthere, sir?\" he demanded, pointing.  \"Well, just to the nor'ard of it\r\nthere's a bush with a lot of white flowers upon it.  See that?\"\r\n\r\nI replied that I did.\r\n\r\n\"Very well,\" continued my companion.  \"Two or three times I've seemed to\r\nsee somethin' movin' among them there white flowers, but I can't be\r\nquite--\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, you are right, I see it; there is something--somebody--there,\" I\r\ninterrupted, having brought the glass to bear upon the spot while\r\nMurdock was speaking.  \"Ah! now I have lost it again,\" I continued, \"but\r\nI am certain I saw a dark face peering through the branches.  Here! let\r\nme have your gun.  If there is really anybody there we'll give him a\r\nscare, if nothing worse.\"\r\n\r\nSo saying, I took the loaded gun, and, keeping my eyes firmly fixed on\r\nthe spot, stretched myself prone on the deck, with the barrel of the\r\nweapon resting upon the rail of the schooner's very low bulwark.\r\nSighting the piece carefully, I brought it to bear immediately on the\r\nspot where I thought I had seen the face, and then waited patiently for\r\nits reappearance.  But minute after minute passed and nothing appeared;\r\nand presently Cunningham and the carpenter came up the beach staggering\r\nunder a load of timber that promised to be amply sufficient for all our\r\nneeds.  I began to think that I must have been mistaken, and was about\r\nto lay aside the gun and descend to the beach again, when the boatswain,\r\nwho had taken the glass from me and had been intently peering through\r\nit, murmured:\r\n\r\n\"There 'tis again, Mr Temple--no, stop a minute, it's gone--no 'tain't!\r\nHave ye got your piece bearin' dead upon that spot, sir?\"\r\n\r\nI answered that I had.\r\n\r\n\"Then stand by, and when I gives the word just you press the trigger,\r\nsir, please.  Wait a bit; I don't--Ah! there he is--fire!\"\r\n\r\nOn the instant I pressed the trigger, and as the smoke cleared away I\r\nthought I saw a slight momentary disturbance of the foliage about the\r\nspot at which I had aimed, and then all was still again.\r\n\r\n\"You got him, sir, as sure as eggs is young chickens!\" exclaimed\r\nMurdock, still peering through the glass.  \"Or, if you didn't actooaly\r\nget him,\" he amended, \"you give him a scare that he won't forget in a\r\nblue moon.  Shall I just slip up there, Mr Temple, and see if I can\r\nfind anything?\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly not,\" I replied severely.  \"We cannot afford to take any\r\nrisks.  Besides, what does it matter?  No, you remain here, reload that\r\ngun, keep the glass, maintain a bright lookout, and if you see any\r\nsavages attempting to sneak down upon the beach, shoot without\r\nhesitation.  What I am chiefly afraid of is that they will muster up\r\nthere in force, and attempt to overwhelm us with a rush.  I am going\r\nbelow to lend the others a hand.\"\r\n\r\nI found Cunningham, Parsons, and Simpson all working at high pressure\r\nunder the bows; for they had of course heard the shot, and did not need\r\nto be told that it indicated the presence of the enemy, though whether\r\nin force or only in the form of a scout none of us could tell.  But the\r\nfact that even one of the savages had already made his way across to our\r\nside of the island was spur enough to our energies, and now we worked as\r\nprobably none of us had ever worked before, in an endeavour to complete\r\nthe cradle, wedge up, and launch the schooner before the enemy should\r\nmuster courage enough to charge home upon us.  If such a thing as that\r\nlast should happen--and it would only mean the loss of a few lives by\r\nthe savages--nothing could possibly save us.\r\n\r\nI had been down on the beach about five minutes when a slight hissing\r\nsound reached my ear, and the next moment a long, triple-barbed, and\r\nexceedingly formidable-looking spear struck the sand and remained\r\nquivering there within about ten feet of us, and at the same instant\r\nMurdock shouted from above:\r\n\r\n\"Mr Temple--Mr Temple, sir, I wish you'd come up here and take my\r\nplace.  They're musterin' up there on top o' the cliff--I can see 'em\r\nmovin' about among the bushes--and I ain't ne'er a good enough shot for\r\nthe job you've told me off for.  If I shoots and misses once or twice\r\nthey'll rush us, as sure as you'm alive, sir; while if two or three of\r\n'em was bowled over it might hold 'em back a bit and give us more time.\r\nCome quick, sir, if you please; I believe they'm gettin' ready for a\r\nrush!\"\r\n\r\nThere was sound sense in what the boatswain said: he was not a good\r\nenough shot, or quite cool enough in the handling of firearms, to stop a\r\nrush, and I therefore determined to act on his suggestion.  Only\r\nCunningham was quite as good a shot as myself, if not better; therefore\r\nI turned to him.\r\n\r\n\"Cunningham,\" said I, \"you hear what Murdock says; and he is right.  But\r\nyou are the crack shot of the party, so please go up and relieve him at\r\nonce.  But before he comes down get him to bring up every gun from\r\nbelow, and our entire stock of cartridges, and make him load every\r\nweapon and place it handy for you.  Go at once, please; and remember you\r\nmust shoot to kill.\"\r\n\r\n\"But, my dear chap--\" began Cunningham, and then I cut him short.\r\n\r\n\"Go at once, sir,\" I exclaimed sharply.  \"This is no time for arguing;\r\nand please remember that I command here.\"\r\n\r\n\"Right you are, old chap; I understand,\" he replied, and went without\r\nfurther ado.  And, as he turned to leave, another spear came whizzing\r\nthrough the air and stuck in the sand exactly where he had been standing\r\na second earlier.  Matters were beginning to look serious, for if the\r\nsavages had among them--as they certainly had--men capable of hurling a\r\nspear from the top of the cliff as far as the schooner, one or the other\r\nof us might be hurt or even killed at any moment.\r\n\r\nA couple of minutes passed, and I heard the voices of Cunningham and\r\nMurdock as they talked together overhead, showing that the engineer had\r\ntaken up his post.  Simpson and I were holding a piece of timber in\r\nposition, while Parsons secured it, when I suddenly saw a tall savage\r\nstep boldly out from among the bushes on top of the cliff, poising a\r\nlong spear in his hand.  He gave the weapon a preliminary jerk, as\r\nthough to test its balance, and then flung it high above his head in the\r\nact of casting.  I was about to shout to Cunningham, calling his\r\nattention to the fellow, when a gun cracked sharply out overhead, and\r\nthe savage spun round upon his heel, staggered backward, and fell\r\ncrashing in among the bushes.\r\n\r\n\"Good shot!\"  I shouted.  \"I say, Cunningham, keep Murdock up there with\r\nyou to reload; we can do very well without him down here.\"\r\n\r\n\"All right,\" came the answer; \"I will, if you are sure that you don't\r\nneed him.  Ah, by Jove! there's another of them!\"\r\n\r\nCunningham's shot took that fellow in the leg, for we saw him clap his\r\nhand to his right one, just above the knee, and go limping away out of\r\nsight.  Apparently the savages believed that the discharge of the weapon\r\nleft us temporarily harmless, for another man instantly sprang into view\r\nand hurriedly poised his spear; but Cunningham was too quick for him,\r\nfor he, too, dropped and lay still.  Then they lay _perdu_ for a few\r\nminutes, during which we, at work upon the cradle, put in some splendid\r\nwork.\r\n\r\nSuddenly, with a final tap of his hammer, Chips sprang back and tossed\r\nthe tool in the air, cleverly catching it by the handle as it fell.\r\n\"Finished!\" he yelled, on a note of exultation.  \"Now, Mr Temple and\r\nSimpson, get the mauls, and let's wedge up.  It'll have to be a rather\r\nrough-and-ready job, I'm afraid; but once the weight of her is off the\r\nblocks and on to the ways we needn't trouble much.  And now, if Mr\r\nCunnin'ham can spare the bo'sun, he'll be useful to us.  Come along,\r\nSails, you and I'll take the starboard side, while Mr Temple and\r\nMurdock takes the port, and we'll see which gets finished first.\"\r\n\r\nI hailed Cunningham, asking if he could spare Murdock, and he replied\r\nthat they were at that moment reloading the whole battery of guns, after\r\nwhich he would send him down.  And presently Murdock came.\r\n\r\n\"Now then, boatswain,\" said I, \"`wedge up' is the word, so take that\r\nmaul and strike with me.  Chips and his mate think they can beat us; but\r\nwe'll show them a thing or two.  Now then, strike!\"\r\n\r\nForthwith the air began to resound with the blows of iron on wood, as,\r\nwith more or less dexterous strokes, we drove the wedges home, one pair\r\nafter another; and in about ten minutes we all met under the little\r\nvessel's counter, our work completed.  But the savages evidently\r\nsuspected that matters were approaching a crisis; possibly the idea was\r\nsuggested to them by the carpenter's triumphant yell of \"Finished!\" upon\r\nthe completion of the cradle, for during that momentous ten minutes\r\nseveral of them had made desperate efforts to transfix us with their\r\nspears, and as they had now adopted the plan of making the attempt in\r\ngroups of half a dozen or more--to all of whom it was manifestly\r\nimpossible for Cunningham to attend at the same moment--we four at work\r\nunder the schooner's bottom had had two or three exceedingly narrow\r\nescapes.\r\n\r\n\"Now, Mr Temple,\" exclaimed the carpenter excitedly, \"I'll just take a\r\nlook fore and aft under her bottom, to make sure that she's clear\r\neverywhere; and when I sing out `All clear!' will you and the rest\r\nplease jump aboard and stand by to cover me with your rifles and protect\r\nme from a rush while I knock away the spur shores and launch the little\r\nhooker?  And you might drop a few ropes' ends over the sides, and\r\nespecially over the bows, for me to swing aboard by as soon as she\r\nstarts to run down the ways.  And if them bronze-coloured skowbanks up\r\non the cliffs there tries to run in upon me with their spears while I'm\r\ndown under, give 'em toko; for if I'm hurted afore them spur shores is\r\nknocked away, we may have a lot of trouble yet.  Ah! blest if I didn't\r\nthink so,\" as Cunningham's shots cracked out thrice, and two natives\r\ntumbled headlong down the face of the cliff, while a third hurriedly\r\nscrambled back to cover; \"they're guessin' that if they don't look sharp\r\nwe'll get away from 'em a'ter all, so please keep a keen eye on 'em,\r\nsir.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ay, ay, Chips, we will,\" answered I.  \"Now, get along with your\r\ninspection, man, as lively as you please, for I see signs of a movement\r\namong them up there.  Simpson,\" to the sailmaker, \"jump aboard and lend\r\nMr Cunningham a hand to reload those guns; and when you have done that,\r\ndrop a few ropes' ends over the sides for Chips to climb aboard by.\"\r\n\r\nBy the time I had finished speaking the carpenter had crept in under the\r\nschooner's bottom and was hastily yet carefully assuring himself that\r\nthe vessel's keel had been everywhere lifted clear of the keel blocks.\r\nLess than three minutes sufficed him to complete his examination, when\r\nhe shouted the signal \"All clear!\" and immediately began to pound upon\r\nthe heels of the spur shores with his maul, while Murdock and I made a\r\ndash for the ladder which afforded access to the schooner's deck.  But\r\nit was clear that the savages had by this time gained a tolerably\r\naccurate conception of what we were about, and had begun to realise that\r\nunless they acted at once we were likely to slip through their hands\r\nafter all; for no sooner did the boatswain and I jump for the ladder\r\nthan they set up a fierce yell, and about a hundred of them broke cover\r\nand began to scramble down the cliff face, shouting encouragement to\r\neach other as they swung or sprang from one projection to another,\r\ntossing their spears and war clubs down to the beach beneath, in order\r\nthat they might have the use of both hands during their hurried descent.\r\nI naturally expected that Cunningham would open fire upon them\r\nforthwith; but he did not, for he was at the moment busily reloading the\r\ndischarged weapons--moreover, it appeared that he had a better plan.\r\n\r\nAt that moment the savages were moving so rapidly and so erratically as\r\nthey swung down the cliff face that accurate shooting would have been\r\nexceedingly difficult; but the instant that the first native reached the\r\nbeach and paused for a second to seize a club and a handful of spears\r\nfrom those which had been cast down from the summit of the cliff, the\r\nengineer, lying prone on the deck, with his weapon resting on the low\r\nrail of the schooner's bulwarks, covered him, and the next instant the\r\nshot rang out and the man toppled over, mortally hit.  Then Cunningham\r\npassed the empty weapon back to Simpson, receiving a loaded one in its\r\nstead, and in like manner bowled over the second and third of the\r\nsavages who reached the beach.  But this could not last long, as I could\r\neasily see upon reaching his side, for the savages were now swarming\r\ndown the cliff so rapidly and in such numbers that it was impossible to\r\nload the guns quickly enough to cope with them.  As Murdock and I dashed\r\nforward and joined the other two in the eyes of the schooner I saw that\r\nabout a dozen of the savages had reached the beach unhurt, and were at\r\nthat instant gathering themselves together to make a combined rush.\r\n\r\n\"Now, lads,\" said I, \"this is where our revolvers are going to come in\r\nuseful.  Wait until they arrive within twenty yards of us, and then open\r\nupon them with the `barkers'; but don't get excited and fire wild,\r\nwhatever you do--we must make every shot tell.  And--Hurrah, my\r\nhearties, there go the spur shores!\" as I heard them clatter down and\r\nfelt a sudden tremor thrill through the schooner.  \"Now, look out, here\r\nthey come!  Watch for the men who pause to hurl their spears, and do\r\nyour best to bowl them over.  She's moving, lads, she's moving!  Hurrah!\r\nAnother minute and we shall be afloat.  Now, look out, and give 'em\r\nbeans!  Here they come!\"\r\n\r\nYes; they were coming with a vengeance, not only the dozen who formed as\r\nit were the vanguard of the rush, but some twenty or thirty more, who in\r\nthe course of a few seconds had flung themselves down from the rocks to\r\nthe soft, yielding sand below, while others were following down the\r\ncliff face at breakneck speed.  They came running and leaping down the\r\nbeach in pursuit of the now fast-moving schooner, each man grasping a\r\nsingle spear in his right hand and three or four more and a war club in\r\nhis left, the whole of them yelling like demons.  At that moment Chips\r\nappeared under the bows, and the sight of him was greeted by the savages\r\nwith a howl of exultation, for they seemed to think that since he was\r\ndown on the sand they had him in their power.  But the carpenter knew\r\nperfectly well what he was about, and as the stem of the gliding\r\nschooner slid past him he made a spring at her wire bobstay, caught it\r\nfirst with one hand, then with the other, pulled himself up and flung\r\nhis legs over it, and then rapidly hauled himself up it to the bowsprit\r\nend, which he reached just as the schooner plunged into the water, swung\r\nhimself astride the spar, and so worked his way inboard.  But it was\r\ntouch and go with him, for the moment he showed himself about a dozen of\r\nthe leading natives pulled up short and prepared to hurl their spears at\r\nhim, and I am convinced that but for the hot revolver fire which we\r\ninstantly opened upon the daring savages, bowling three of them over and\r\nso seriously disconcerting the aim of the others that they missed,\r\nMaster Chips would, even at the last moment, have lost the number of his\r\nmess.  But with the plunge of the schooner into the water all danger was\r\nover, for the little craft held her way in the most wonderful fashion,\r\nmaking so long a stern board into the waters of the bay that she shot\r\nfar beyond the extreme range of the savages' spears before she finally\r\ncame to rest.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile her canvas was all loose and ready for setting; therefore the\r\nmoment I felt her to be water borne I dashed aft to the tiller, at the\r\nsame time shouting to the others to man the foresail and fore staysail\r\nhalyards and hoist away: and by the time the foresail was hoisted the\r\nvessel was beginning to lose sternway, whereupon I jammed her tiller\r\nhard-over to port, and thus canted her with her head to the northward.\r\nThis caused her head sails to fill, whereupon she quickly gathered\r\nheadway, when, putting the helm hard up, I headed her out to sea, while\r\nthe others proceeded to set the jib and mainsail; and within ten minutes\r\nof her first plunge into the water the little _Nautilus_--as we named\r\nher--was clear of the reef and fairly in the open sea.\r\n\r\nThere were several trifling jobs that we would have preferred to finish\r\noff before proceeding to sea, several articles that we would fain have\r\ncarried away from the island with us, had we been afforded the\r\nopportunity; but the presence of the savages of course precluded this,\r\nand therefore the moment that we were under way and clear of the western\r\nextremity of the island we flattened in our sheets, fore and aft, and\r\nproceeded to the northward, close-hauled on the starboard tack on our\r\nway to Honolulu, which was to be our first port of call.\r\n\r\nNaturally the first and most engrossing question claiming our attention\r\nwas that of the behaviour of our little ship, and we had not been under\r\nway a quarter of an hour before we were all agreed that she far exceeded\r\nour most sanguine expectations; she was a magnificent little sea boat,\r\nriding the long Pacific surges as buoyantly as a gull, very stiff under\r\nher canvas, and extraordinarily fast and weatherly.  The only thing that\r\ncaused us any concern was that we found she was leaking to a somewhat\r\nalarming extent; but we were quite prepared for that, as she had been\r\nstanding so long on the hot beach that her planks had shrunk somewhat,\r\nopening her seams.  She \"took up\" however during the course of the\r\nnight, after keeping us busy at the pump for the first three or four\r\nhours of our voyage, and after that we had no further trouble with her.\r\n\r\nThe island was a mere faint blue smudge on the horizon astern when the\r\nsun when down on the evening of that eventful day, and on the ninth\r\nmorning following we safely arrived at Honolulu.  Here, thanks to\r\nCunningham's hundred and forty sovereigns, which he had contrived to\r\nhold on to through all our vicissitudes of fortune, we found ourselves\r\npossessed of money enough to carry us round the Horn and as far as\r\nBaltimore, where we had decided to call on our way home.\r\n\r\nWe remained in Honolulu four days, making arrangements for our long and\r\nadventurous voyage round the southern extremity of the great American\r\ncontinent, and then gaily started, disregarding the strenuous warnings\r\nof the many friends made by us during our brief stay.  And adventures\r\nenough and to spare we had, enough to fill another book of this size;\r\nbut that, as a certain writer has remarked, is another story.  It must\r\nsuffice me now to say that we reached Punta Arenas, in the Strait of\r\nMagellan, fifty-three days after leaving Honolulu, stayed there two\r\ndays, and safely arrived in Baltimore harbour two months, to the day,\r\nafter leaving Punta Arenas.\r\n\r\nWe had a little difficulty in finding \"Marthy\", the relict of the late\r\nlamented Captain Ephraim Brown, but we found her at last, introduced\r\nourselves, broke to her as gently as possible the news of her husband's\r\ndeath, and then unfolded to her the story of the pearls.  What between\r\nthe news of her loss, and that of the enormous wealth coming to her\r\nthrough her late husband's good fortune, the poor old soul was driven\r\nnearly crazy for a time; but she was a woman of strong common sense and\r\na wonderfully practical turn of mind, and in the course of three or four\r\ndays she rallied her faculties sufficiently to decide that she would put\r\nthe whole of her affairs in the hands of a firm of lawyers of undoubted\r\nintegrity, which, we agreed with her, was about the wisest thing she\r\ncould do.  Accordingly we handed over the pearls to them, leaving them\r\nto arrange the complicated question of duty, etcetera, and left\r\nBaltimore for England after a stay of just a fortnight.  During our\r\nsojourn in Baltimore a heavy easterly gale had swept the Atlantic for a\r\nfull week; then came a spell of fine weather and moderate westerly\r\nwinds, which carried us clean across the \"Pond\" in twenty-two days, our\r\narrival at Southampton, \"all well\", occurring on 27 August, 1864.\r\n\r\nOf course I was now a rich man, and did not need to trouble myself about\r\ncompleting my indentures, or obtaining another berth; but I nevertheless\r\nmade a point of reporting myself at the offices in London of the owners\r\nof the _Zenobia_, where I was very cordially received.  And here I had\r\nthe satisfaction of learning, first, that the _Zenobia's_ longboat had\r\nbeen picked up within twelve hours by a homeward-bound ship from\r\nCalcutta, thanks to which fortunate circumstance Captain Roberts's life\r\nhad been saved--as well as those of all the other occupants of the boat;\r\nand he was now as well as ever, and again in command of his ship, which\r\nhad been captured some seven weeks after the occurrence of the mutiny,\r\nfollowing upon an unsuccessful attempt to \"hold up\" an Australian\r\nclipper, in which attempt Bainbridge, the instigator of the mutiny, had\r\nbeen shot dead.",
